in, thermodynamics, heat, is, the, thermal, energy, transferred, between, systems, due, to, a, temperature, difference, in, colloquial, use, heat, sometimes, refers, to, thermal, energy, itself, thermal, energy, is, the, kinetic, energy, of, vibrating, and, colliding, atoms, in, a, substance, an, example, of, formal, vs, informal, usage, may, be, obtained, from, the, right, hand, photo, in, which, the, metal, bar, is, conducting, heat, from, its, hot, end, to, its, cold, end, but, if, the, metal, bar, is, considered, a, thermodynamic, system, then, the, energy, flowing, within, the, metal, bar, is, called, internal, energy, not, heat, the, hot, metal, bar, is, also, transferring, heat, to, its, surroundings, a, correct, statement, for, both, the, strict, and, loose, meanings, of, heat, another, example, of, informal, usage, is, the, term, heat, content, used, despite, the, fact, that, physics, defines, heat, as, energy, transfer, more, accurately, it, is, thermal, energy, that, is, contained, in, the, system, or, body, as, it, is, stored, in, the, microscopic, degrees, of, freedom, of, the, modes, of, vibration, heat, is, energy, in, transfer, to, or, from, a, thermodynamic, system, by, a, mechanism, that, involves, the, microscopic, atomic, modes, of, motion, or, the, corresponding, macroscopic, properties, this, descriptive, characterization, excludes, the, transfers, of, energy, by, thermodynamic, work, or, mass, transfer, defined, quantitatively, the, heat, involved, in, a, process, is, the, difference, in, internal, energy, between, the, final, and, initial, states, of, a, system, and, subtracting, the, work, done, in, the, process, this, is, the, formulation, of, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, calorimetry, is, measurement, of, quantity, of, energy, transferred, as, heat, by, its, effect, on, the, states, of, interacting, bodies, for, example, by, the, amount, of, ice, melted, or, by, change, in, temperature, of, a, body, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, the, unit, of, measurement, for, heat, as, a, form, of, energy, is, the, joule, j, as, a, form, of, energy, heat, has, the, unit, joule, j, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, in, addition, many, applied, branches, of, engineering, use, other, traditional, units, such, as, the, british, thermal, unit, btu, and, the, calorie, the, standard, unit, for, the, rate, of, heating, is, the, watt, w, defined, as, one, joule, per, second, the, symbol, q, for, heat, was, introduced, by, rudolf, clausius, and, macquorn, rankine, in, c, 1859, heat, released, by, a, system, into, its, surroundings, is, by, convention, a, negative, quantity, q, 0, when, a, system, absorbs, heat, from, its, surroundings, it, is, positive, q, 0, heat, transfer, rate, or, heat, flow, per, unit, time, is, denoted, by, q, displaystyle, dot, q, but, it, is, not, a, time, derivative, of, a, function, of, state, which, can, also, be, written, with, the, dot, notation, since, heat, is, not, a, function, of, state, heat, flux, is, defined, as, rate, of, heat, transfer, per, unit, cross, sectional, area, watts, per, square, metre, as, a, common, noun, english, heat, or, warmth, just, as, french, chaleur, german, w, rme, latin, calor, greek, etc, refers, to, the, human, perception, of, either, thermal, energy, or, temperature, speculation, on, thermal, energy, or, heat, as, a, separate, form, of, matter, has, a, long, history, identified, as, caloric, theory, phlogiston, theory, and, fire, heat, has, been, discussed, in, ordinary, language, by, philosophers, an, example, is, this, 1720, quote, from, john, locke, this, source, was, repeatedly, quoted, by, joule, john, tyndall, s, heat, considered, as, mode, of, motion, 1863, was, instrumental, in, popularizing, the, idea, of, heat, as, motion, to, the, english, speaking, public, the, theory, was, developed, in, academic, publications, in, french, english, and, german, from, an, early, time, the, french, technical, term, chaleur, used, by, carnot, was, taken, as, equivalent, to, the, english, heat, and, german, w, rme, lit, warmth, while, the, equivalent, of, heat, would, be, german, hitze, the, modern, understanding, of, heat, is, often, partly, attributed, to, thompson, s, 1798, mechanical, theory, of, heat, an, experimental, enquiry, concerning, the, source, of, the, heat, which, is, excited, by, friction, postulating, a, mechanical, equivalent, of, heat, a, collaboration, between, nicolas, cl, ment, and, sadi, carnot, reflections, on, the, motive, power, of, fire, in, the, 1820s, had, some, related, thinking, along, similar, lines, in, 1842, julius, robert, mayer, frictionally, generated, heat, in, paper, pulp, and, measured, the, temperature, rise, in, 1845, joule, published, a, paper, entitled, the, mechanical, equivalent, of, heat, in, which, he, specified, a, numerical, value, for, the, amount, of, mechanical, work, required, to, produce, a, unit, of, heat, based, on, heat, production, by, friction, in, the, passage, of, electricity, through, a, resistor, and, in, the, rotation, of, a, paddle, in, a, vat, of, water, the, theory, of, classical, thermodynamics, matured, in, the, 1850s, to, 1860s, in, 1850, clausius, responding, to, joule, s, experimental, demonstrations, of, heat, production, by, friction, rejected, the, caloric, doctrine, of, conservation, of, heat, writing, the, process, function, q, was, introduced, by, rudolf, clausius, in, 1850, clausius, described, it, with, the, german, compound, w, rmemenge, translated, as, amount, of, heat, james, clerk, maxwell, in, his, 1871, theory, of, heat, outlines, four, stipulations, for, the, definition, of, heat, in, 1907, g, h, bryan, published, an, investigation, of, the, foundations, of, thermodynamics, thermodynamics, an, introductory, treatise, dealing, mainly, with, first, principles, and, their, direct, applications, b, g, teubner, leipzig, bryan, was, writing, when, thermodynamics, had, been, established, empirically, but, people, were, still, interested, to, specify, its, logical, structure, the, 1909, work, of, carath, odory, also, belongs, to, this, historical, era, bryan, was, a, physicist, while, carath, odory, was, a, mathematician, bryan, started, his, treatise, with, an, introductory, chapter, on, the, notions, of, heat, and, of, temperature, he, gives, an, example, of, where, the, notion, of, heating, as, raising, a, body, s, temperature, contradicts, the, notion, of, heating, as, imparting, a, quantity, of, heat, to, that, body, he, defined, an, adiabatic, transformation, as, one, in, which, the, body, neither, gains, nor, loses, heat, this, is, not, quite, the, same, as, defining, an, adiabatic, transformation, as, one, that, occurs, to, a, body, enclosed, by, walls, impermeable, to, radiation, and, conduction, he, recognized, calorimetry, as, a, way, of, measuring, quantity, of, heat, he, recognized, water, as, having, a, temperature, of, maximum, density, this, makes, water, unsuitable, as, a, thermometric, substance, around, that, temperature, he, intended, to, remind, readers, of, why, thermodynamicists, preferred, an, absolute, scale, of, temperature, independent, of, the, properties, of, a, particular, thermometric, substance, his, second, chapter, started, with, the, recognition, of, friction, as, a, source, of, heat, by, benjamin, thompson, by, humphry, davy, by, robert, mayer, and, by, james, prescott, joule, he, stated, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, or, mayer, joule, principle, as, follows, he, wrote, he, explained, how, the, caloric, theory, of, lavoisier, and, laplace, made, sense, in, terms, of, pure, calorimetry, though, it, failed, to, account, for, conversion, of, work, into, heat, by, such, mechanisms, as, friction, and, conduction, of, electricity, having, rationally, defined, quantity, of, heat, he, went, on, to, consider, the, second, law, including, the, kelvin, definition, of, absolute, thermodynamic, temperature, in, section, 41, he, wrote, he, then, stated, the, principle, of, conservation, of, energy, he, then, wrote, on, page, 46, thinking, of, closed, systems, in, thermal, connection, he, wrote, on, page, 47, still, thinking, of, closed, systems, in, thermal, connection, he, wrote, on, page, 48, he, wrote, a, celebrated, and, frequent, definition, of, heat, in, thermodynamics, is, based, on, the, work, of, carath, odory, 1909, referring, to, processes, in, a, closed, system, carath, odory, was, responding, to, a, suggestion, by, max, born, that, he, examine, the, logical, structure, of, thermodynamics, the, internal, energy, u, x, of, a, body, in, an, arbitrary, state, x, can, be, determined, by, amounts, of, work, adiabatically, performed, by, the, body, on, its, surroundings, when, it, starts, from, a, reference, state, o, such, work, is, assessed, through, quantities, defined, in, the, surroundings, of, the, body, it, is, supposed, that, such, work, can, be, assessed, accurately, without, error, due, to, friction, in, the, surroundings, friction, in, the, body, is, not, excluded, by, this, definition, the, adiabatic, performance, of, work, is, defined, in, terms, of, adiabatic, walls, which, allow, transfer, of, energy, as, work, but, no, other, transfer, of, energy, or, matter, in, particular, they, do, not, allow, the, passage, of, energy, as, heat, according, to, this, definition, work, performed, adiabatically, is, in, general, accompanied, by, friction, within, the, thermodynamic, system, or, body, on, the, other, hand, according, to, carath, odory, 1909, there, also, exist, non, adiabatic, diathermal, walls, which, are, postulated, to, be, permeable, only, to, heat, for, the, definition, of, quantity, of, energy, transferred, as, heat, it, is, customarily, envisaged, that, an, arbitrary, state, of, interest, y, is, reached, from, state, o, by, a, process, with, two, components, one, adiabatic, and, the, other, not, adiabatic, for, convenience, one, may, say, that, the, adiabatic, component, was, the, sum, of, work, done, by, the, body, through, volume, change, through, movement, of, the, walls, while, the, non, adiabatic, wall, was, temporarily, rendered, adiabatic, and, of, isochoric, adiabatic, work, then, the, non, adiabatic, component, is, a, process, of, energy, transfer, through, the, wall, that, passes, only, heat, newly, made, accessible, for, the, purpose, of, this, transfer, from, the, surroundings, to, the, body, the, change, in, internal, energy, to, reach, the, state, y, from, the, state, o, is, the, difference, of, the, two, amounts, of, energy, transferred, although, carath, odory, himself, did, not, state, such, a, definition, following, his, work, it, is, customary, in, theoretical, studies, to, define, heat, q, to, the, body, from, its, surroundings, in, the, combined, process, of, change, to, state, y, from, the, state, o, as, the, change, in, internal, energy, u, y, minus, the, amount, of, work, w, done, by, the, body, on, its, surrounds, by, the, adiabatic, process, so, that, q, u, y, w, in, this, definition, for, the, sake, of, conceptual, rigour, the, quantity, of, energy, transferred, as, heat, is, not, specified, directly, in, terms, of, the, non, adiabatic, process, it, is, defined, through, knowledge, of, precisely, two, variables, the, change, of, internal, energy, and, the, amount, of, adiabatic, work, done, for, the, combined, process, of, change, from, the, reference, state, o, to, the, arbitrary, state, y, it, is, important, that, this, does, not, explicitly, involve, the, amount, of, energy, transferred, in, the, non, adiabatic, component, of, the, combined, process, it, is, assumed, here, that, the, amount, of, energy, required, to, pass, from, state, o, to, state, y, the, change, of, internal, energy, is, known, independently, of, the, combined, process, by, a, determination, through, a, purely, adiabatic, process, like, that, for, the, determination, of, the, internal, energy, of, state, x, above, the, rigour, that, is, prized, in, this, definition, is, that, there, is, one, and, only, one, kind, of, energy, transfer, admitted, as, fundamental, energy, transferred, as, work, energy, transfer, as, heat, is, considered, as, a, derived, quantity, the, uniqueness, of, work, in, this, scheme, is, considered, to, guarantee, rigor, and, purity, of, conception, the, conceptual, purity, of, this, definition, based, on, the, concept, of, energy, transferred, as, work, as, an, ideal, notion, relies, on, the, idea, that, some, frictionless, and, otherwise, non, dissipative, processes, of, energy, transfer, can, be, realized, in, physical, actuality, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, on, the, other, hand, assures, us, that, such, processes, are, not, found, in, nature, before, the, rigorous, mathematical, definition, of, heat, based, on, carath, odory, s, 1909, paper, historically, heat, temperature, and, thermal, equilibrium, were, presented, in, thermodynamics, textbooks, as, jointly, primitive, notions, carath, odory, introduced, his, 1909, paper, thus, the, proposition, that, the, discipline, of, thermodynamics, can, be, justified, without, recourse, to, any, hypothesis, that, cannot, be, verified, experimentally, must, be, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, noteworthy, results, of, the, research, in, thermodynamics, that, was, accomplished, during, the, last, century, referring, to, the, point, of, view, adopted, by, most, authors, who, were, active, in, the, last, fifty, years, carath, odory, wrote, there, exists, a, physical, quantity, called, heat, that, is, not, identical, with, the, mechanical, quantities, mass, force, pressure, etc, and, whose, variations, can, be, determined, by, calorimetric, measurements, james, serrin, introduces, an, account, of, the, theory, of, thermodynamics, thus, in, the, following, section, we, shall, use, the, classical, notions, of, heat, work, and, hotness, as, primitive, elements, that, heat, is, an, appropriate, and, natural, primitive, for, thermodynamics, was, already, accepted, by, carnot, its, continued, validity, as, a, primitive, element, of, thermodynamical, structure, is, due, to, the, fact, that, it, synthesizes, an, essential, physical, concept, as, well, as, to, its, successful, use, in, recent, work, to, unify, different, constitutive, theories, this, traditional, kind, of, presentation, of, the, basis, of, thermodynamics, includes, ideas, that, may, be, summarized, by, the, statement, that, heat, transfer, is, purely, due, to, spatial, non, uniformity, of, temperature, and, is, by, conduction, and, radiation, from, hotter, to, colder, bodies, it, is, sometimes, proposed, that, this, traditional, kind, of, presentation, necessarily, rests, on, circular, reasoning, this, alternative, approach, to, the, definition, of, quantity, of, energy, transferred, as, heat, differs, in, logical, structure, from, that, of, carath, odory, recounted, just, above, this, alternative, approach, admits, calorimetry, as, a, primary, or, direct, way, to, measure, quantity, of, energy, transferred, as, heat, it, relies, on, temperature, as, one, of, its, primitive, concepts, and, used, in, calorimetry, it, is, presupposed, that, enough, processes, exist, physically, to, allow, measurement, of, differences, in, internal, energies, such, processes, are, not, restricted, to, adiabatic, transfers, of, energy, as, work, they, include, calorimetry, which, is, the, commonest, practical, way, of, finding, internal, energy, differences, the, needed, temperature, can, be, either, empirical, or, absolute, thermodynamic, in, contrast, the, carath, odory, way, recounted, just, above, does, not, use, calorimetry, or, temperature, in, its, primary, definition, of, quantity, of, energy, transferred, as, heat, the, carath, odory, way, regards, calorimetry, only, as, a, secondary, or, indirect, way, of, measuring, quantity, of, energy, transferred, as, heat, as, recounted, in, more, detail, just, above, the, carath, odory, way, regards, quantity, of, energy, transferred, as, heat, in, a, process, as, primarily, or, directly, defined, as, a, residual, quantity, it, is, calculated, from, the, difference, of, the, internal, energies, of, the, initial, and, final, states, of, the, system, and, from, the, actual, work, done, by, the, system, during, the, process, that, internal, energy, difference, is, supposed, to, have, been, measured, in, advance, through, processes, of, purely, adiabatic, transfer, of, energy, as, work, processes, that, take, the, system, between, the, initial, and, final, states, by, the, carath, odory, way, it, is, presupposed, as, known, from, experiment, that, there, actually, physically, exist, enough, such, adiabatic, processes, so, that, there, need, be, no, recourse, to, calorimetry, for, measurement, of, quantity, of, energy, transferred, as, heat, this, presupposition, is, essential, but, is, explicitly, labeled, neither, as, a, law, of, thermodynamics, nor, as, an, axiom, of, the, carath, odory, way, in, fact, the, actual, physical, existence, of, such, adiabatic, processes, is, indeed, mostly, supposition, and, those, supposed, processes, have, in, most, cases, not, been, actually, verified, empirically, to, exist, over, the, years, for, example, in, his, 1879, thesis, but, particularly, in, 1926, planck, advocated, regarding, the, generation, of, heat, by, rubbing, as, the, most, specific, way, to, define, heat, planck, criticised, carath, odory, for, not, attending, to, this, carath, odory, was, a, mathematician, who, liked, to, think, in, terms, of, adiabatic, processes, and, perhaps, found, friction, to, tricky, to, think, about, while, planck, was, a, physicist, referring, to, conduction, partington, writes, if, a, hot, body, is, brought, in, conducting, contact, with, a, cold, body, the, temperature, of, the, hot, body, falls, and, that, of, the, cold, body, rises, and, it, is, said, that, a, quantity, of, heat, has, passed, from, the, hot, body, to, the, cold, body, referring, to, radiation, maxwell, writes, in, radiation, the, hotter, body, loses, heat, and, the, colder, body, receives, heat, by, means, of, a, process, occurring, in, some, intervening, medium, which, does, not, itself, thereby, become, hot, maxwell, writes, that, convection, as, such, is, not, a, purely, thermal, phenomenon, in, thermodynamics, convection, in, general, is, regarded, as, transport, of, internal, energy, if, however, the, convection, is, enclosed, and, circulatory, then, it, may, be, regarded, as, an, intermediary, that, transfers, energy, as, heat, between, source, and, destination, bodies, because, it, transfers, only, energy, and, not, matter, from, the, source, to, the, destination, body, in, accordance, with, the, first, law, for, closed, systems, energy, transferred, solely, as, heat, leaves, one, body, and, enters, another, changing, the, internal, energies, of, each, transfer, between, bodies, of, energy, as, work, is, a, complementary, way, of, changing, internal, energies, though, it, is, not, logically, rigorous, from, the, viewpoint, of, strict, physical, concepts, a, common, form, of, words, that, expresses, this, is, to, say, that, heat, and, work, are, interconvertible, cyclically, operating, engines, that, use, only, heat, and, work, transfers, have, two, thermal, reservoirs, a, hot, and, a, cold, one, they, may, be, classified, by, the, range, of, operating, temperatures, of, the, working, body, relative, to, those, reservoirs, in, a, heat, engine, the, working, body, is, at, all, times, colder, than, the, hot, reservoir, and, hotter, than, the, cold, reservoir, in, a, sense, it, uses, heat, transfer, to, produce, work, in, a, heat, pump, the, working, body, at, stages, of, the, cycle, goes, both, hotter, than, the, hot, reservoir, and, colder, than, the, cold, reservoir, in, a, sense, it, uses, work, to, produce, heat, transfer, in, classical, thermodynamics, a, commonly, considered, model, is, the, heat, engine, it, consists, of, four, bodies, the, working, body, the, hot, reservoir, the, cold, reservoir, and, the, work, reservoir, a, cyclic, process, leaves, the, working, body, in, an, unchanged, state, and, is, envisaged, as, being, repeated, indefinitely, often, work, transfers, between, the, working, body, and, the, work, reservoir, are, envisaged, as, reversible, and, thus, only, one, work, reservoir, is, needed, but, two, thermal, reservoirs, are, needed, because, transfer, of, energy, as, heat, is, irreversible, a, single, cycle, sees, energy, taken, by, the, working, body, from, the, hot, reservoir, and, sent, to, the, two, other, reservoirs, the, work, reservoir, and, the, cold, reservoir, the, hot, reservoir, always, and, only, supplies, energy, and, the, cold, reservoir, always, and, only, receives, energy, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, requires, that, no, cycle, can, occur, in, which, no, energy, is, received, by, the, cold, reservoir, heat, engines, achieve, higher, efficiency, when, the, ratio, of, the, initial, and, final, temperature, is, greater, another, commonly, considered, model, is, the, heat, pump, or, refrigerator, again, there, are, four, bodies, the, working, body, the, hot, reservoir, the, cold, reservoir, and, the, work, reservoir, a, single, cycle, starts, with, the, working, body, colder, than, the, cold, reservoir, and, then, energy, is, taken, in, as, heat, by, the, working, body, from, the, cold, reservoir, then, the, work, reservoir, does, work, on, the, working, body, adding, more, to, its, internal, energy, making, it, hotter, than, the, hot, reservoir, the, hot, working, body, passes, heat, to, the, hot, reservoir, but, still, remains, hotter, than, the, cold, reservoir, then, by, allowing, it, to, expand, without, passing, heat, to, another, body, the, working, body, is, made, colder, than, the, cold, reservoir, it, can, now, accept, heat, transfer, from, the, cold, reservoir, to, start, another, cycle, the, device, has, transported, energy, from, a, colder, to, a, hotter, reservoir, but, this, is, not, regarded, as, by, an, inanimate, agency, rather, it, is, regarded, as, by, the, harnessing, of, work, this, is, because, work, is, supplied, from, the, work, reservoir, not, just, by, a, simple, thermodynamic, process, but, by, a, cycle, of, thermodynamic, operations, and, processes, which, may, be, regarded, as, directed, by, an, animate, or, harnessing, agency, accordingly, the, cycle, is, still, in, accord, with, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, the, efficiency, of, a, heat, pump, which, exceeds, unity, is, best, when, the, temperature, difference, between, the, hot, and, cold, reservoirs, is, least, functionally, such, engines, are, used, in, two, ways, distinguishing, a, target, reservoir, and, a, resource, or, surrounding, reservoir, a, heat, pump, transfers, heat, to, the, hot, reservoir, as, the, target, from, the, resource, or, surrounding, reservoir, a, refrigerator, transfers, heat, from, the, cold, reservoir, as, the, target, to, the, resource, or, surrounding, reservoir, the, target, reservoir, may, be, regarded, as, leaking, when, the, target, leaks, heat, to, the, surroundings, heat, pumping, is, used, when, the, target, leaks, coldness, to, the, surroundings, refrigeration, is, used, the, engines, harness, work, to, overcome, the, leaks, according, to, planck, there, are, three, main, conceptual, approaches, to, heat, one, is, the, microscopic, or, kinetic, theory, approach, the, other, two, are, macroscopic, approaches, one, of, the, macroscopic, approaches, is, through, the, law, of, conservation, of, energy, taken, as, prior, to, thermodynamics, with, a, mechanical, analysis, of, processes, for, example, in, the, work, of, helmholtz, this, mechanical, view, is, taken, in, this, article, as, currently, customary, for, thermodynamic, theory, the, other, macroscopic, approach, is, the, thermodynamic, one, which, admits, heat, as, a, primitive, concept, which, contributes, by, scientific, induction, to, knowledge, of, the, law, of, conservation, of, energy, this, view, is, widely, taken, as, the, practical, one, quantity, of, heat, being, measured, by, calorimetry, bailyn, also, distinguishes, the, two, macroscopic, approaches, as, the, mechanical, and, the, thermodynamic, the, thermodynamic, view, was, taken, by, the, founders, of, thermodynamics, in, the, nineteenth, century, it, regards, quantity, of, energy, transferred, as, heat, as, a, primitive, concept, coherent, with, a, primitive, concept, of, temperature, measured, primarily, by, calorimetry, a, calorimeter, is, a, body, in, the, surroundings, of, the, system, with, its, own, temperature, and, internal, energy, when, it, is, connected, to, the, system, by, a, path, for, heat, transfer, changes, in, it, measure, heat, transfer, the, mechanical, view, was, pioneered, by, helmholtz, and, developed, and, used, in, the, twentieth, century, largely, through, the, influence, of, max, born, it, regards, quantity, of, heat, transferred, as, heat, as, a, derived, concept, defined, for, closed, systems, as, quantity, of, heat, transferred, by, mechanisms, other, than, work, transfer, the, latter, being, regarded, as, primitive, for, thermodynamics, defined, by, macroscopic, mechanics, according, to, born, the, transfer, of, internal, energy, between, open, systems, that, accompanies, transfer, of, matter, cannot, be, reduced, to, mechanics, it, follows, that, there, is, no, well, founded, definition, of, quantities, of, energy, transferred, as, heat, or, as, work, associated, with, transfer, of, matter, nevertheless, for, the, thermodynamical, description, of, non, equilibrium, processes, it, is, desired, to, consider, the, effect, of, a, temperature, gradient, established, by, the, surroundings, across, the, system, of, interest, when, there, is, no, physical, barrier, or, wall, between, system, and, surroundings, that, is, to, say, when, they, are, open, with, respect, to, one, another, the, impossibility, of, a, mechanical, definition, in, terms, of, work, for, this, circumstance, does, not, alter, the, physical, fact, that, a, temperature, gradient, causes, a, diffusive, flux, of, internal, energy, a, process, that, in, the, thermodynamic, view, might, be, proposed, as, a, candidate, concept, for, transfer, of, energy, as, heat, in, this, circumstance, it, may, be, expected, that, there, may, also, be, active, other, drivers, of, diffusive, flux, of, internal, energy, such, as, gradient, of, chemical, potential, which, drives, transfer, of, matter, and, gradient, of, electric, potential, which, drives, electric, current, and, iontophoresis, such, effects, usually, interact, with, diffusive, flux, of, internal, energy, driven, by, temperature, gradient, and, such, interactions, are, known, as, cross, effects, if, cross, effects, that, result, in, diffusive, transfer, of, internal, energy, were, also, labeled, as, heat, transfers, they, would, sometimes, violate, the, rule, that, pure, heat, transfer, occurs, only, down, a, temperature, gradient, never, up, one, they, would, also, contradict, the, principle, that, all, heat, transfer, is, of, one, and, the, same, kind, a, principle, founded, on, the, idea, of, heat, conduction, between, closed, systems, one, might, to, try, to, think, narrowly, of, heat, flux, driven, purely, by, temperature, gradient, as, a, conceptual, component, of, diffusive, internal, energy, flux, in, the, thermodynamic, view, the, concept, resting, specifically, on, careful, calculations, based, on, detailed, knowledge, of, the, processes, and, being, indirectly, assessed, in, these, circumstances, if, perchance, it, happens, that, no, transfer, of, matter, is, actualized, and, there, are, no, cross, effects, then, the, thermodynamic, concept, and, the, mechanical, concept, coincide, as, if, one, were, dealing, with, closed, systems, but, when, there, is, transfer, of, matter, the, exact, laws, by, which, temperature, gradient, drives, diffusive, flux, of, internal, energy, rather, than, being, exactly, knowable, mostly, need, to, be, assumed, and, in, many, cases, are, practically, unverifiable, consequently, when, there, is, transfer, of, matter, the, calculation, of, the, pure, heat, flux, component, of, the, diffusive, flux, of, internal, energy, rests, on, practically, unverifiable, assumptions, this, is, a, reason, to, think, of, heat, as, a, specialized, concept, that, relates, primarily, and, precisely, to, closed, systems, and, applicable, only, in, a, very, restricted, way, to, open, systems, in, many, writings, in, this, context, the, term, heat, flux, is, used, when, what, is, meant, is, therefore, more, accurately, called, diffusive, flux, of, internal, energy, such, usage, of, the, term, heat, flux, is, a, residue, of, older, and, now, obsolete, language, usage, that, allowed, that, a, body, may, have, a, heat, content, in, the, kinetic, theory, heat, is, explained, in, terms, of, the, microscopic, motions, and, interactions, of, constituent, particles, such, as, electrons, atoms, and, molecules, the, immediate, meaning, of, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, constituent, particles, is, not, as, heat, it, is, as, a, component, of, internal, energy, in, microscopic, terms, heat, is, a, transfer, quantity, and, is, described, by, a, transport, theory, not, as, steadily, localized, kinetic, energy, of, particles, heat, transfer, arises, from, temperature, gradients, or, differences, through, the, diffuse, exchange, of, microscopic, kinetic, and, potential, particle, energy, by, particle, collisions, and, other, interactions, an, early, and, vague, expression, of, this, was, made, by, francis, bacon, precise, and, detailed, versions, of, it, were, developed, in, the, nineteenth, century, in, statistical, mechanics, for, a, closed, system, no, transfer, of, matter, heat, is, the, energy, transfer, associated, with, a, disordered, microscopic, action, on, the, system, associated, with, jumps, in, occupation, numbers, of, the, energy, levels, of, the, system, without, change, in, the, values, of, the, energy, levels, themselves, it, is, possible, for, macroscopic, thermodynamic, work, to, alter, the, occupation, numbers, without, change, in, the, values, of, the, system, energy, levels, themselves, but, what, distinguishes, transfer, as, heat, is, that, the, transfer, is, entirely, due, to, disordered, microscopic, action, including, radiative, transfer, a, mathematical, definition, can, be, formulated, for, small, increments, of, quasi, static, adiabatic, work, in, terms, of, the, statistical, distribution, of, an, ensemble, of, microstates, quantity, of, heat, transferred, can, be, measured, by, calorimetry, or, determined, through, calculations, based, on, other, quantities, calorimetry, is, the, empirical, basis, of, the, idea, of, quantity, of, heat, transferred, in, a, process, the, transferred, heat, is, measured, by, changes, in, a, body, of, known, properties, for, example, temperature, rise, change, in, volume, or, length, or, phase, change, such, as, melting, of, ice, a, calculation, of, quantity, of, heat, transferred, can, rely, on, a, hypothetical, quantity, of, energy, transferred, as, adiabatic, work, and, on, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, such, calculation, is, the, primary, approach, of, many, theoretical, studies, of, quantity, of, heat, transferred, the, discipline, of, heat, transfer, typically, considered, an, aspect, of, mechanical, engineering, and, chemical, engineering, deals, with, specific, applied, methods, by, which, thermal, energy, in, a, system, is, generated, or, converted, or, transferred, to, another, system, although, the, definition, of, heat, implicitly, means, the, transfer, of, energy, the, term, heat, transfer, encompasses, this, traditional, usage, in, many, engineering, disciplines, and, laymen, language, heat, transfer, is, generally, described, as, including, the, mechanisms, of, heat, conduction, heat, convection, thermal, radiation, but, may, include, mass, transfer, and, heat, in, processes, of, phase, changes, convection, may, be, described, as, the, combined, effects, of, conduction, and, fluid, flow, from, the, thermodynamic, point, of, view, heat, flows, into, a, fluid, by, diffusion, to, increase, its, energy, the, fluid, then, transfers, advects, this, increased, internal, energy, not, heat, from, one, location, to, another, and, this, is, then, followed, by, a, second, thermal, interaction, which, transfers, heat, to, a, second, body, or, system, again, by, diffusion, this, entire, process, is, often, regarded, as, an, additional, mechanism, of, heat, transfer, although, technically, heat, transfer, and, thus, heating, and, cooling, occurs, only, on, either, end, of, such, a, conductive, flow, but, not, as, a, result, of, flow, thus, conduction, can, be, said, to, transfer, heat, only, as, a, net, result, of, the, process, but, may, not, do, so, at, every, time, within, the, complicated, convective, process, in, an, 1847, lecture, entitled, on, matter, living, force, and, heat, james, prescott, joule, characterized, the, terms, latent, heat, and, sensible, heat, as, components, of, heat, each, affecting, distinct, physical, phenomena, namely, the, potential, and, kinetic, energy, of, particles, respectively, he, described, latent, energy, as, the, energy, possessed, via, a, distancing, of, particles, where, attraction, was, over, a, greater, distance, i, e, a, form, of, potential, energy, and, the, sensible, heat, as, an, energy, involving, the, motion, of, particles, i, e, kinetic, energy, latent, heat, is, the, heat, released, or, absorbed, by, a, chemical, substance, or, a, thermodynamic, system, during, a, change, of, state, that, occurs, without, a, change, in, temperature, such, a, process, may, be, a, phase, transition, such, as, the, melting, of, ice, or, the, boiling, of, water, heat, capacity, is, a, measurable, physical, quantity, equal, to, the, ratio, of, the, heat, added, to, an, object, to, the, resulting, temperature, change, the, molar, heat, capacity, is, the, heat, capacity, per, unit, amount, si, unit, mole, of, a, pure, substance, and, the, specific, heat, capacity, often, called, simply, specific, heat, is, the, heat, capacity, per, unit, mass, of, a, material, heat, capacity, is, a, physical, property, of, a, substance, which, means, that, it, depends, on, the, state, and, properties, of, the, substance, under, consideration, the, specific, heats, of, monatomic, gases, such, as, helium, are, nearly, constant, with, temperature, diatomic, gases, such, as, hydrogen, display, some, temperature, dependence, and, triatomic, gases, e, g, carbon, dioxide, still, more, before, the, development, of, the, laws, of, thermodynamics, heat, was, measured, by, changes, in, the, states, of, the, participating, bodies, some, general, rules, with, important, exceptions, can, be, stated, as, follows, in, general, most, bodies, expand, on, heating, in, this, circumstance, heating, a, body, at, a, constant, volume, increases, the, pressure, it, exerts, on, its, constraining, walls, while, heating, at, a, constant, pressure, increases, its, volume, beyond, this, most, substances, have, three, ordinarily, recognized, states, of, matter, solid, liquid, and, gas, some, can, also, exist, in, a, plasma, many, have, further, more, finely, differentiated, states, of, matter, such, as, glass, and, liquid, crystal, in, many, cases, at, fixed, temperature, and, pressure, a, substance, can, exist, in, several, distinct, states, of, matter, in, what, might, be, viewed, as, the, same, body, for, example, ice, may, float, in, a, glass, of, water, then, the, ice, and, the, water, are, said, to, constitute, two, phases, within, the, body, definite, rules, are, known, telling, how, distinct, phases, may, coexist, in, a, body, mostly, at, a, fixed, pressure, there, is, a, definite, temperature, at, which, heating, causes, a, solid, to, melt, or, evaporate, and, a, definite, temperature, at, which, heating, causes, a, liquid, to, evaporate, in, such, cases, cooling, has, the, reverse, effects, all, of, these, the, commonest, cases, fit, with, a, rule, that, heating, can, be, measured, by, changes, of, state, of, a, body, such, cases, supply, what, are, called, thermometric, bodies, that, allow, the, definition, of, empirical, temperatures, before, 1848, all, temperatures, were, defined, in, this, way, there, was, thus, a, tight, link, apparently, logically, determined, between, heat, and, temperature, though, they, were, recognized, as, conceptually, thoroughly, distinct, especially, by, joseph, black, in, the, later, eighteenth, century, there, are, important, exceptions, they, break, the, obviously, apparent, link, between, heat, and, temperature, they, make, it, clear, that, empirical, definitions, of, temperature, are, contingent, on, the, peculiar, properties, of, particular, thermometric, substances, and, are, thus, precluded, from, the, title, absolute, for, example, water, contracts, on, being, heated, near, 277, k, it, cannot, be, used, as, a, thermometric, substance, near, that, temperature, also, over, a, certain, temperature, range, ice, contracts, on, heating, moreover, many, substances, can, exist, in, metastable, states, such, as, with, negative, pressure, that, survive, only, transiently, and, in, very, special, conditions, such, facts, sometimes, called, anomalous, are, some, of, the, reasons, for, the, thermodynamic, definition, of, absolute, temperature, in, the, early, days, of, measurement, of, high, temperatures, another, factor, was, important, and, used, by, josiah, wedgwood, in, his, pyrometer, the, temperature, reached, in, a, process, was, estimated, by, the, shrinkage, of, a, sample, of, clay, the, higher, the, temperature, the, more, the, shrinkage, this, was, the, only, available, more, or, less, reliable, method, of, measurement, of, temperatures, above, 1000, c, 1, 832, f, but, such, shrinkage, is, irreversible, the, clay, does, not, expand, again, on, cooling, that, is, why, it, could, be, used, for, the, measurement, but, only, once, it, is, not, a, thermometric, material, in, the, usual, sense, of, the, word, nevertheless, the, thermodynamic, definition, of, absolute, temperature, does, make, essential, use, of, the, concept, of, heat, with, proper, circumspection, the, property, of, hotness, is, a, concern, of, thermodynamics, that, should, be, defined, without, reference, to, the, concept, of, heat, consideration, of, hotness, leads, to, the, concept, of, empirical, temperature, all, physical, systems, are, capable, of, heating, or, cooling, others, with, reference, to, hotness, the, comparative, terms, hotter, and, colder, are, defined, by, the, rule, that, heat, flows, from, the, hotter, body, to, the, colder, if, a, physical, system, is, inhomogeneous, or, very, rapidly, or, irregularly, changing, for, example, by, turbulence, it, may, be, impossible, to, characterize, it, by, a, temperature, but, still, there, can, be, transfer, of, energy, as, heat, between, it, and, another, system, if, a, system, has, a, physical, state, that, is, regular, enough, and, persists, long, enough, to, allow, it, to, reach, thermal, equilibrium, with, a, specified, thermometer, then, it, has, a, temperature, according, to, that, thermometer, an, empirical, thermometer, registers, degree, of, hotness, for, such, a, system, such, a, temperature, is, called, empirical, for, example, truesdell, writes, about, classical, thermodynamics, at, each, time, the, body, is, assigned, a, real, number, called, the, temperature, this, number, is, a, measure, of, how, hot, the, body, is, physical, systems, that, are, too, turbulent, to, have, temperatures, may, still, differ, in, hotness, a, physical, system, that, passes, heat, to, another, physical, system, is, said, to, be, the, hotter, of, the, two, more, is, required, for, the, system, to, have, a, thermodynamic, temperature, its, behavior, must, be, so, regular, that, its, empirical, temperature, is, the, same, for, all, suitably, calibrated, and, scaled, thermometers, and, then, its, hotness, is, said, to, lie, on, the, one, dimensional, hotness, manifold, this, is, part, of, the, reason, why, heat, is, defined, following, carath, odory, and, born, solely, as, occurring, other, than, by, work, or, transfer, of, matter, temperature, is, advisedly, and, deliberately, not, mentioned, in, this, now, widely, accepted, definition, this, is, also, the, reason, that, the, zeroth, law, of, thermodynamics, is, stated, explicitly, if, three, physical, systems, a, b, and, c, are, each, not, in, their, own, states, of, internal, thermodynamic, equilibrium, it, is, possible, that, with, suitable, physical, connections, being, made, between, them, a, can, heat, b, and, b, can, heat, c, and, c, can, heat, a, in, non, equilibrium, situations, cycles, of, flow, are, possible, it, is, the, special, and, uniquely, distinguishing, characteristic, of, internal, thermodynamic, equilibrium, that, this, possibility, is, not, open, to, thermodynamic, systems, as, distinguished, amongst, physical, systems, which, are, in, their, own, states, of, internal, thermodynamic, equilibrium, this, is, the, reason, why, the, zeroth, law, of, thermodynamics, needs, explicit, statement, that, is, to, say, the, relation, is, not, colder, than, between, general, non, equilibrium, physical, systems, is, not, transitive, whereas, in, contrast, the, relation, has, no, lower, a, temperature, than, between, thermodynamic, systems, in, their, own, states, of, internal, thermodynamic, equilibrium, is, transitive, it, follows, from, this, that, the, relation, is, in, thermal, equilibrium, with, is, transitive, which, is, one, way, of, stating, the, zeroth, law, just, as, temperature, may, be, undefined, for, a, sufficiently, inhomogeneous, system, so, also, may, entropy, be, undefined, for, a, system, not, in, its, own, state, of, internal, thermodynamic, equilibrium, for, example, the, temperature, of, the, solar, system, is, not, a, defined, quantity, likewise, the, entropy, of, the, solar, system, is, not, defined, in, classical, thermodynamics, it, has, not, been, possible, to, define, non, equilibrium, entropy, as, a, simple, number, for, a, whole, system, in, a, clearly, satisfactory, way, for, a, closed, system, a, system, from, which, no, matter, can, enter, or, exit, one, version, of, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, states, that, the, change, in, internal, energy, u, of, the, system, is, equal, to, the, amount, of, heat, q, supplied, to, the, system, minus, the, amount, of, thermodynamic, work, w, done, by, system, on, its, surroundings, the, foregoing, sign, convention, for, work, is, used, in, the, present, article, but, an, alternate, sign, convention, followed, by, iupac, for, work, is, to, consider, the, work, performed, on, the, system, by, its, surroundings, as, positive, this, is, the, convention, adopted, by, many, modern, textbooks, of, physical, chemistry, such, as, those, by, peter, atkins, and, ira, levine, but, many, textbooks, on, physics, define, work, as, work, done, by, the, system, this, formula, can, be, re, written, so, as, to, express, a, definition, of, quantity, of, energy, transferred, as, heat, based, purely, on, the, concept, of, adiabatic, work, if, it, is, supposed, that, u, is, defined, and, measured, solely, by, processes, of, adiabatic, work, the, thermodynamic, work, done, by, the, system, is, through, mechanisms, defined, by, its, thermodynamic, state, variables, for, example, its, volume, v, not, through, variables, that, necessarily, involve, mechanisms, in, the, surroundings, the, latter, are, such, as, shaft, work, and, include, isochoric, work, the, internal, energy, u, is, a, state, function, in, cyclical, processes, such, as, the, operation, of, a, heat, engine, state, functions, of, the, working, substance, return, to, their, initial, values, upon, completion, of, a, cycle, the, differential, or, infinitesimal, increment, for, the, internal, energy, in, an, infinitesimal, process, is, an, exact, differential, d, u, the, symbol, for, exact, differentials, is, the, lowercase, letter, d, in, contrast, neither, of, the, infinitesimal, increments, q, nor, w, in, an, infinitesimal, process, represents, the, change, in, a, state, function, of, the, system, thus, infinitesimal, increments, of, heat, and, work, are, inexact, differentials, the, lowercase, greek, letter, delta, is, the, symbol, for, inexact, differentials, the, integral, of, any, inexact, differential, in, a, process, where, the, system, leaves, and, then, returns, to, the, same, thermodynamic, state, does, not, necessarily, equal, zero, as, recounted, above, in, the, section, headed, heat, and, entropy, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, observes, that, if, heat, is, supplied, to, a, system, in, a, reversible, process, the, increment, of, heat, q, and, the, temperature, t, form, the, exact, differential, and, that, s, the, entropy, of, the, working, body, is, a, state, function, likewise, with, a, well, defined, pressure, p, behind, a, slowly, moving, quasistatic, boundary, the, work, differential, w, and, the, pressure, p, combine, to, form, the, exact, differential, with, v, the, volume, of, the, system, which, is, a, state, variable, in, general, for, systems, of, uniform, pressure, and, temperature, without, composition, change, associated, with, this, differential, equation, is, the, concept, that, the, internal, energy, may, be, considered, to, be, a, function, u, s, v, of, its, natural, variables, s, and, v, the, internal, energy, representation, of, the, fundamental, thermodynamic, relation, is, written, as, if, v, is, constant, and, if, p, is, constant, with, the, enthalpy, h, defined, by, the, enthalpy, may, be, considered, to, be, a, function, h, s, p, of, its, natural, variables, s, and, p, the, enthalpy, representation, of, the, fundamental, thermodynamic, relation, is, written, the, internal, energy, representation, and, the, enthalpy, representation, are, partial, legendre, transforms, of, one, another, they, contain, the, same, physical, information, written, in, different, ways, like, the, internal, energy, the, enthalpy, stated, as, a, function, of, its, natural, variables, is, a, thermodynamic, potential, and, contains, all, thermodynamic, information, about, a, body, if, a, quantity, q, of, heat, is, added, to, a, body, while, it, does, only, expansion, work, w, on, its, surroundings, one, has, if, this, is, constrained, to, happen, at, constant, pressure, i, e, with, p, 0, the, expansion, work, w, done, by, the, body, is, given, by, w, p, v, recalling, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, one, has, consequently, by, substitution, one, has, in, this, scenario, the, increase, in, enthalpy, is, equal, to, the, quantity, of, heat, added, to, the, system, this, is, the, basis, of, the, determination, of, enthalpy, changes, in, chemical, reactions, by, calorimetry, since, many, processes, do, take, place, at, constant, atmospheric, pressure, the, enthalpy, is, sometimes, given, the, misleading, name, of, heat, content, or, heat, function, while, it, actually, depends, strongly, on, the, energies, of, covalent, bonds, and, intermolecular, forces, in, terms, of, the, natural, variables, s, and, p, of, the, state, function, h, this, process, of, change, of, state, from, state, 1, to, state, 2, can, be, expressed, as, it, is, known, that, the, temperature, t, s, p, is, identically, stated, by, consequently, in, this, case, the, integral, specifies, a, quantity, of, heat, transferred, at, constant, pressure, in, 1856, rudolf, clausius, referring, to, closed, systems, in, which, transfers, of, matter, do, not, occur, defined, the, second, fundamental, theorem, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, in, the, mechanical, theory, of, heat, thermodynamics, if, two, transformations, which, without, necessitating, any, other, permanent, change, can, mutually, replace, one, another, be, called, equivalent, then, the, generations, of, the, quantity, of, heat, q, from, work, at, the, temperature, t, has, the, equivalence, value, in, 1865, he, came, to, define, the, entropy, symbolized, by, s, such, that, due, to, the, supply, of, the, amount, of, heat, q, at, temperature, t, the, entropy, of, the, system, is, increased, by, in, a, transfer, of, energy, as, heat, without, work, being, done, there, are, changes, of, entropy, in, both, the, surroundings, which, lose, heat, and, the, system, which, gains, it, the, increase, s, of, entropy, in, the, system, may, be, considered, to, consist, of, two, parts, an, increment, s, that, matches, or, compensates, the, change, s, of, entropy, in, the, surroundings, and, a, further, increment, s, that, may, be, considered, to, be, generated, or, produced, in, the, system, and, is, said, therefore, to, be, uncompensated, thus, this, may, also, be, written, the, total, change, of, entropy, in, the, system, and, surroundings, is, thus, this, may, also, be, written, it, is, then, said, that, an, amount, of, entropy, s, has, been, transferred, from, the, surroundings, to, the, system, because, entropy, is, not, a, conserved, quantity, this, is, an, exception, to, the, general, way, of, speaking, in, which, an, amount, transferred, is, of, a, conserved, quantity, from, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, it, follows, that, in, a, spontaneous, transfer, of, heat, in, which, the, temperature, of, the, system, is, different, from, that, of, the, surroundings, for, purposes, of, mathematical, analysis, of, transfers, one, thinks, of, fictive, processes, that, are, called, reversible, with, the, temperature, t, of, the, system, being, hardly, less, than, that, of, the, surroundings, and, the, transfer, taking, place, at, an, imperceptibly, slow, rate, following, the, definition, above, in, formula, 1, for, such, a, fictive, reversible, process, a, quantity, of, transferred, heat, q, an, inexact, differential, is, analyzed, as, a, quantity, t, d, s, with, d, s, an, exact, differential, this, equality, is, only, valid, for, a, fictive, transfer, in, which, there, is, no, production, of, entropy, that, is, to, say, in, which, there, is, no, uncompensated, entropy, if, in, contrast, the, process, is, natural, and, can, really, occur, with, irreversibility, then, there, is, entropy, production, with, d, s, uncompensated, 0, the, quantity, t, d, s, uncompensated, was, termed, by, clausius, the, uncompensated, heat, though, that, does, not, accord, with, present, day, terminology, then, one, has, this, leads, to, the, statement, which, is, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, for, closed, systems, in, non, equilibrium, thermodynamics, that, makes, the, approximation, of, assuming, the, hypothesis, of, local, thermodynamic, equilibrium, there, is, a, special, notation, for, this, the, transfer, of, energy, as, heat, is, assumed, to, take, place, across, an, infinitesimal, temperature, difference, so, that, the, system, element, and, its, surroundings, have, near, enough, the, same, temperature, t, then, one, writes, where, by, definition, the, second, law, for, a, natural, process, asserts, that
