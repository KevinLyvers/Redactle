a, waterfall, is, any, point, in, a, river, or, stream, where, water, flows, over, a, vertical, drop, or, a, series, of, steep, drops, waterfalls, also, occur, where, meltwater, drops, over, the, edge, of, a, tabular, iceberg, or, ice, shelf, waterfalls, can, be, formed, in, several, ways, but, the, most, common, method, of, formation, is, that, a, river, courses, over, a, top, layer, of, resistant, bedrock, before, falling, onto, softer, rock, which, erodes, faster, leading, to, an, increasingly, high, fall, waterfalls, have, been, studied, for, their, impact, on, species, living, in, and, around, them, humans, have, had, a, distinct, relationship, with, waterfalls, since, prehistory, travelling, to, see, them, exploring, and, naming, them, they, can, present, formidable, barriers, to, navigation, along, rivers, waterfalls, are, religious, sites, in, many, cultures, since, the, 18th, century, they, have, received, increased, attention, as, tourist, destinations, sources, of, hydropower, and, particularly, since, the, mid, 20th, century, as, subjects, of, research, a, waterfall, is, generally, defined, as, a, point, in, a, river, where, water, flows, over, a, steep, drop, that, is, close, to, or, directly, vertical, in, 2000, mabin, specified, that, the, horizontal, distance, between, the, positions, of, the, lip, and, plunge, pool, should, be, no, more, than, c, 25, of, the, waterfall, height, there, are, various, types, and, methods, to, classify, waterfalls, some, scholars, have, included, rapids, as, a, subsection, what, actually, constitutes, a, waterfall, continues, to, be, debated, waterfalls, are, sometimes, interchangeably, referred, to, as, cascades, and, cataracts, though, some, sources, specify, a, cataract, as, being, a, larger, and, more, powerful, waterfall, and, a, cascade, as, being, smaller, a, plunge, pool, is, a, type, of, stream, pool, formed, at, the, bottom, of, a, waterfall, a, waterfall, may, also, be, referred, to, as, a, foss, or, force, waterfalls, are, commonly, formed, in, the, upper, course, of, a, river, where, lakes, flow, into, valleys, in, steep, mountains, a, river, sometimes, flows, over, a, large, step, in, the, rocks, that, may, have, been, formed, by, a, fault, line, waterfalls, can, occur, along, the, edge, of, a, glacial, trough, where, a, stream, or, river, flowing, into, a, glacier, continues, to, flow, into, a, valley, after, the, glacier, has, receded, or, melted, the, large, waterfalls, in, yosemite, valley, are, examples, of, this, phenomenon, which, is, referred, to, as, a, hanging, valley, another, reason, hanging, valleys, may, form, is, where, two, rivers, join, and, one, is, flowing, faster, than, the, other, when, warm, and, cold, water, meets, by, a, gorge, in, the, ocean, large, underwater, waterfalls, can, form, as, the, cold, water, rushes, to, the, bottom, the, caprock, model, of, waterfall, formation, states, that, the, river, courses, over, resistant, bedrock, erosion, happens, slowly, and, is, dominated, by, impacts, of, water, borne, sediment, on, the, rock, while, downstream, the, erosion, occurs, more, rapidly, as, the, watercourse, increases, its, velocity, at, the, edge, of, the, waterfall, it, may, pluck, material, from, the, riverbed, if, the, bed, is, fractured, or, otherwise, more, erodible, hydraulic, jets, and, hydraulic, jumps, at, the, toe, of, a, falls, can, generate, large, forces, to, erode, the, bed, especially, when, forces, are, amplified, by, water, borne, sediment, horseshoe, shaped, falls, focus, the, erosion, to, a, central, point, also, enhancing, riverbed, change, below, a, waterfall, a, process, known, as, potholing, involves, local, erosion, of, a, potentially, deep, hole, in, bedrock, due, to, turbulent, whirlpools, spinning, stones, around, on, the, bed, drilling, it, out, sand, and, stones, carried, by, the, watercourse, therefore, increase, erosion, capacity, this, causes, the, waterfall, to, carve, deeper, into, the, bed, and, to, recede, upstream, often, over, time, the, waterfall, will, recede, back, to, form, a, canyon, or, gorge, downstream, as, it, recedes, upstream, and, it, will, carve, deeper, into, the, ridge, above, it, the, rate, of, retreat, for, a, waterfall, can, be, as, high, as, one, and, a, half, metres, per, year, often, the, rock, stratum, just, below, the, more, resistant, shelf, will, be, of, a, softer, type, meaning, that, undercutting, due, to, splashback, will, occur, here, to, form, a, shallow, cave, like, formation, known, as, a, rock, shelter, under, and, behind, the, waterfall, eventually, the, outcropping, more, resistant, cap, rock, will, collapse, under, pressure, to, add, blocks, of, rock, to, the, base, of, the, waterfall, these, blocks, of, rock, are, then, broken, down, into, smaller, boulders, by, attrition, as, they, collide, with, each, other, and, they, also, erode, the, base, of, the, waterfall, by, abrasion, creating, a, deep, plunge, pool, in, the, gorge, downstream, streams, can, become, wider, and, shallower, just, above, waterfalls, due, to, flowing, over, the, rock, shelf, and, there, is, usually, a, deep, area, just, below, the, waterfall, because, of, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, water, hitting, the, bottom, however, a, study, of, waterfalls, systematics, reported, that, waterfalls, can, be, wider, or, narrower, above, or, below, a, falls, so, almost, anything, is, possible, given, the, right, geological, and, hydrological, setting, waterfalls, normally, form, in, a, rocky, area, due, to, erosion, after, a, long, period, of, being, fully, formed, the, water, falling, off, the, ledge, will, retreat, causing, a, horizontal, pit, parallel, to, the, waterfall, wall, eventually, as, the, pit, grows, deeper, the, waterfall, collapses, to, be, replaced, by, a, steeply, sloping, stretch, of, river, bed, in, addition, to, gradual, processes, such, as, erosion, earth, movement, caused, by, earthquakes, or, landslides, or, volcanoes, can, lead, to, the, formation, of, waterfalls, waterfalls, are, an, important, factor, in, determining, the, distribution, of, lotic, organisms, such, as, fish, and, aquatic, invertebrates, as, they, may, restrict, dispersal, along, streams, the, presence, or, absence, of, certain, species, can, have, cascading, ecological, effects, and, thus, cause, differences, in, trophic, regimes, above, and, below, waterfalls, certain, aquatic, plants, and, insects, also, specialize, in, the, environment, of, the, waterfall, itself, a, 2012, study, of, the, agbokim, waterfalls, has, suggested, that, they, hold, biodiversity, to, a, much, higher, extent, than, previously, thought, waterfalls, also, affect, terrestrial, species, they, create, a, small, microclimate, in, their, immediate, vicinity, characterized, by, cooler, temperatures, and, higher, humidity, than, the, surrounding, region, which, may, support, diverse, communities, of, mosses, and, liverworts, species, of, these, plants, may, have, disjunct, populations, at, waterfall, zones, far, from, their, core, range, waterfalls, provide, nesting, cover, for, several, species, of, bird, such, as, the, black, swift, and, white, throated, dipper, these, species, preferentially, nest, in, the, space, behind, the, falling, water, which, is, thought, to, be, a, strategy, to, avoid, predation, some, waterfalls, are, also, distinct, in, that, they, do, not, flow, continuously, ephemeral, waterfalls, only, flow, after, a, rain, or, a, significant, snowmelt, waterfalls, can, also, be, found, underground, and, in, oceans, the, geographer, andrew, goudie, wrote, in, 2020, that, waterfalls, have, received, surprisingly, limited, research, alexander, von, humboldt, wrote, about, them, in, the, 1820s, there, is, no, name, for, the, specific, field, of, researching, waterfalls, and, in, the, published, literature, been, described, as, scattered, though, it, is, popular, to, describe, studying, waterfalls, as, waterfallology, an, early, paper, written, on, waterfalls, was, published, in, 1884, by, william, morris, davis, a, geologist, known, as, the, father, of, american, geography, in, the, 1930s, edward, rashleigh, published, a, pioneering, work, on, waterfalls, in, 1942, oscar, von, engeln, wrote, of, the, lack, of, research, on, waterfalls, waterfall, sites, more, than, any, other, geomorphic, feature, attract, and, hold, the, interest, of, the, general, public, because, they, have, such, a, popular, approval, waterfalls, are, not, given, serious, attention, by, some, students, of, systematic, geomorphology, this, attitude, is, not, to, be, commended, waterfalls, are, significant, items, for, geomorphic, investigation, as, late, as, 1985, a, scholar, felt, that, waterfalls, remain, a, very, much, neglected, aspect, of, river, studies, studies, of, waterfalls, increased, dramatically, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, numerous, waterfall, guidebooks, exist, and, the, world, waterfall, database, is, a, website, cataloging, thousands, of, waterfalls, many, explorers, have, visited, waterfalls, european, explorers, recorded, waterfalls, they, came, across, in, 1493, christopher, columbus, noted, carbet, falls, in, guadeloupe, which, was, likely, the, first, waterfall, europeans, recorded, seeing, in, the, americas, in, the, late, 1600s, louis, hennepin, visited, north, america, providing, early, descriptions, of, niagara, falls, and, the, saint, anthony, falls, the, geographer, brian, j, hudson, argues, that, it, was, uncommon, to, specifically, name, waterfalls, until, the, 1700s, the, trend, of, europeans, specifically, naming, falls, was, in, tandem, with, increased, scientific, focus, on, nature, the, rise, of, romanticism, and, increased, importance, of, hydropower, with, the, industrial, revolution, european, explorers, often, preferred, to, give, waterfalls, names, in, their, own, language, for, instance, david, livingstone, named, victoria, falls, after, queen, victoria, though, it, was, known, by, local, peoples, as, mosi, oa, tunya, many, waterfalls, have, descriptive, names, which, can, come, from, the, river, they, are, on, places, they, are, near, their, features, or, events, that, happened, near, them, some, countries, that, were, colonized, by, european, nations, have, taken, steps, to, return, names, to, waterfalls, previously, renamed, by, european, explorers, exploration, of, waterfalls, continues, the, gocta, cataracts, were, first, announced, to, the, world, in, 2006, waterfalls, can, pose, major, barriers, to, travel, canals, are, sometimes, built, as, a, method, to, go, around, them, other, times, things, must, be, physically, carried, around, or, a, railway, built, in, 1885, the, geographer, george, chisholm, wrote, that, the, most, signal, example, of, the, effect, of, waterfalls, and, rapids, in, retarding, the, development, of, civilisation, is, undoubtedly, presented, by, the, continent, of, africa, the, darkness, of, which, is, almost, entirely, due, to, this, cause, waterfalls, are, often, visited, by, people, simply, to, see, them, hudson, theorizes, that, they, make, good, tourism, sites, because, they, are, generally, considered, beautiful, and, are, relatively, uncommon, activities, at, waterfalls, can, include, bathing, swimming, photography, rafting, canyoning, abseiling, rock, climbing, and, ice, climbing, waterfalls, can, also, be, sites, for, generating, hydroelectric, power, and, can, hold, good, fishing, opportunities, wealthy, people, were, known, to, visit, areas, with, features, such, as, waterfalls, at, least, as, early, as, in, ancient, rome, and, china, however, many, waterfalls, were, essentially, inaccessible, due, to, the, treacherous, terrain, surrounding, them, until, improvements, began, to, be, made, such, as, paths, to, the, falls, becoming, common, across, the, united, kingdom, and, america, in, the, 1800s, and, continuing, through, the, 1900s, and, into, the, 21st, century, remote, waterfalls, are, now, often, visited, by, air, travel, human, development, has, also, threatened, many, waterfalls, for, instance, the, gua, ra, falls, once, one, of, the, most, powerful, waterfalls, in, the, world, were, submerged, in, 1982, by, a, human, made, dam, as, were, the, ripon, falls, in, 1952, conversely, other, waterfalls, have, seen, significantly, lower, water, levels, as, a, result, of, diversion, for, hydroelectricity, such, as, the, tyssestrengene, in, norway, development, of, the, areas, around, falls, as, tourist, attractions, has, also, destroyed, the, natural, scene, around, many, of, them, waterfalls, are, included, on, thirty, eight, world, heritage, sites, and, many, others, are, protected, by, governments, waterfalls, play, a, role, in, many, cultures, as, religious, sites, and, subjects, of, art, and, music, many, artists, have, painted, waterfalls, and, they, are, referenced, in, many, songs, such, as, those, of, the, kaluli, people, in, papua, new, guinea, michael, harner, titled, his, study, of, the, jivaroan, peoples, of, ecuador, the, jivaro, people, of, the, sacred, waterfalls, artists, such, as, those, of, the, hudson, river, school, and, j, m, w, turner, and, john, sell, cotman, painted, particularly, notable, pictures, of, waterfalls, in, the, 19th, century, one, of, the, versions, of, the, shinto, purification, ceremony, of, misogi, involves, standing, underneath, a, waterfall, in, ritual, clothing, in, japan, the, nachi, falls, are, a, site, of, pilgrimage, as, are, falls, near, tirupati, india, and, the, saut, d, eau, haiti, the, otavalos, use, piguchi, waterfall, as, part, of, the, churru, ritual, which, serves, as, a, coming, of, age, ceremony, many, waterfalls, in, africa, were, places, of, worship, for, the, native, peoples, and, got, their, names, from, gods, in, the, local, religion, in, chinese, tradition, the, waterfall, represents, the, season, of, autumn, yin, and, the, chinese, dragon, s, power, over, water, that, comes, from, the, former, two, there, are, thousands, of, waterfalls, in, the, world, though, no, exact, number, has, been, calculated, the, world, waterfall, database, lists, 7, 827, as, of, 2013, but, this, is, likely, incomplete, as, noted, by, hudson, over, 90, of, their, listings, are, in, north, america, many, guidebooks, to, local, waterfalls, have, been, published, there, is, also, no, agreement, how, to, measure, the, height, of, a, waterfall, or, even, what, constitutes, one, angel, falls, in, venezuela, is, the, tallest, waterfall, in, the, world, the, khone, phapheng, falls, in, laos, are, the, widest, and, the, inga, falls, on, the, congo, river, are, the, biggest, by, flow, rate, while, the, dry, falls, in, washington, are, the, largest, confirmed, waterfalls, ever, the, highest, known, subterranean, waterfall, is, in, vrtoglavica, cave, in, slovenia, the, denmark, strait, cataract, is, an, undersea, overflow, which, could, be, considered, a, waterfall, under, a, very, broad, usage, of, that, term, if, so, included, it, is, the, largest, known, waterfall, artificial, waterfalls, are, water, features, or, fountains, that, imitate, a, natural, waterfall, the, cascata, delle, marmore, is, the, tallest, artificially, built, waterfall, at, 541, feet, 165, m
