nickel, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, ni, and, atomic, number, 28, it, is, a, silvery, white, lustrous, metal, with, a, slight, golden, tinge, nickel, is, a, hard, and, ductile, transition, metal, pure, nickel, is, chemically, reactive, but, large, pieces, are, slow, to, react, with, air, under, standard, conditions, because, a, passivation, layer, of, nickel, oxide, forms, on, the, surface, that, prevents, further, corrosion, even, so, pure, native, nickel, is, found, in, earth, s, crust, only, in, tiny, amounts, usually, in, ultramafic, rocks, and, in, the, interiors, of, larger, nickel, iron, meteorites, that, were, not, exposed, to, oxygen, when, outside, earth, s, atmosphere, meteoric, nickel, is, found, in, combination, with, iron, a, reflection, of, the, origin, of, those, elements, as, major, end, products, of, supernova, nucleosynthesis, an, iron, nickel, mixture, is, thought, to, compose, earth, s, outer, and, inner, cores, use, of, nickel, as, natural, meteoric, nickel, iron, alloy, has, been, traced, as, far, back, as, 3500, bce, nickel, was, first, isolated, and, classified, as, an, element, in, 1751, by, axel, fredrik, cronstedt, who, initially, mistook, the, ore, for, a, copper, mineral, in, the, cobalt, mines, of, los, h, lsingland, sweden, the, element, s, name, comes, from, a, mischievous, sprite, of, german, miner, mythology, nickel, similar, to, old, nick, nickel, minerals, can, be, green, like, copper, ores, and, were, known, as, kupfernickel, nickel, s, copper, because, they, produced, no, copper, although, most, nickel, in, the, earth, s, crust, exists, as, oxides, economically, more, important, nickel, ores, are, sulfides, especially, pentlandite, major, production, sites, include, the, sudbury, region, canada, which, is, thought, to, be, of, meteoric, origin, new, caledonia, in, the, pacific, western, australia, and, norilsk, russia, nickel, is, one, of, four, elements, the, others, are, iron, cobalt, and, gadolinium, that, are, ferromagnetic, at, about, room, temperature, alnico, permanent, magnets, based, partly, on, nickel, are, of, intermediate, strength, between, iron, based, permanent, magnets, and, rare, earth, magnets, the, metal, is, used, chiefly, in, alloys, and, corrosion, resistant, plating, about, 68, of, world, production, is, used, in, stainless, steel, a, further, 10, is, used, for, nickel, based, and, copper, based, alloys, 9, for, plating, 7, for, alloy, steels, 3, in, foundries, and, 4, in, other, applications, such, as, in, rechargeable, batteries, including, those, in, electric, vehicles, evs, nickel, is, widely, used, in, coins, though, nickel, plated, objects, sometimes, provoke, nickel, allergy, as, a, compound, nickel, has, a, number, of, niche, chemical, manufacturing, uses, such, as, a, catalyst, for, hydrogenation, cathodes, for, rechargeable, batteries, pigments, and, metal, surface, treatments, nickel, is, an, essential, nutrient, for, some, microorganisms, and, plants, that, have, enzymes, with, nickel, as, an, active, site, nickel, is, a, silvery, white, metal, with, a, slight, golden, tinge, that, takes, a, high, polish, it, is, one, of, only, four, elements, that, are, ferromagnetic, at, or, near, room, temperature, the, others, are, iron, cobalt, and, gadolinium, its, curie, temperature, is, 355, c, 671, f, meaning, that, bulk, nickel, is, non, magnetic, above, this, temperature, the, unit, cell, of, nickel, is, a, face, centered, cube, it, has, lattice, parameter, of, 0, 352, nm, giving, an, atomic, radius, of, 0, 124, nm, this, crystal, structure, is, stable, to, pressures, of, at, least, 70, gpa, nickel, is, hard, malleable, and, ductile, and, has, a, relatively, high, electrical, and, thermal, conductivity, for, transition, metals, the, high, compressive, strength, of, 34, gpa, predicted, for, ideal, crystals, is, never, obtained, in, the, real, bulk, material, due, to, formation, and, movement, of, dislocations, however, it, has, been, reached, in, ni, nanoparticles, nickel, has, two, atomic, electron, configurations, 3d, 8, 4s, 2, and, 3d, 9, 4s, 1, which, are, very, close, in, energy, denotes, the, complete, argon, core, structure, there, is, some, disagreement, on, which, configuration, has, the, lower, energy, chemistry, textbooks, quote, nickel, s, electron, configuration, as, 4s, 2, 3d, 8, also, written, 3d, 8, 4s, 2, this, configuration, agrees, with, the, madelung, energy, ordering, rule, which, predicts, that, 4s, is, filled, before, 3d, it, is, supported, by, the, experimental, fact, that, the, lowest, energy, state, of, the, nickel, atom, is, a, 3d, 8, 4s, 2, energy, level, specifically, the, 3d, 8, 3, f, 4s, 2, 3, f, j, 4, level, however, each, of, these, two, configurations, splits, into, several, energy, levels, due, to, fine, structure, and, the, two, sets, of, energy, levels, overlap, the, average, energy, of, states, with, 3d, 9, 4s, 1, is, actually, lower, than, the, average, energy, of, states, with, 3d, 8, 4s, 2, therefore, the, research, literature, on, atomic, calculations, quotes, the, ground, state, configuration, as, 3d, 9, 4s, 1, the, isotopes, of, nickel, range, in, atomic, weight, from, 48, u, 48, ni, to, 82, u, 82, ni, natural, nickel, is, composed, of, five, stable, isotopes, 58, ni, 60, ni, 61, ni, 62, ni, and, 64, ni, of, which, 58, ni, is, the, most, abundant, 68, 077, natural, abundance, nickel, 62, has, the, highest, binding, energy, per, nucleon, of, any, nuclide, 8, 7946, mev, nucleon, its, binding, energy, is, greater, than, both, 56, fe, and, 58, fe, more, abundant, nuclides, often, incorrectly, cited, as, having, the, highest, binding, energy, though, this, would, seem, to, predict, nickel, as, the, most, abundant, heavy, element, in, the, universe, the, high, rate, of, photodisintegration, of, nickel, in, stellar, interiors, causes, iron, to, be, by, far, the, most, abundant, nickel, 60, is, the, daughter, product, of, the, extinct, radionuclide, 60, fe, half, life, 2, 6, million, years, due, to, the, long, half, life, of, 60, fe, its, persistence, in, materials, in, the, solar, system, may, generate, observable, variations, in, the, isotopic, composition, of, 60, ni, therefore, the, abundance, of, 60, ni, in, extraterrestrial, material, may, give, insight, into, the, origin, of, the, solar, system, and, its, early, history, at, least, 26, nickel, radioisotopes, have, been, characterized, the, most, stable, are, 59, ni, with, half, life, 76, 000, years, 63, ni, 100, years, and, 56, ni, 6, days, all, other, radioisotopes, have, half, lives, less, than, 60, hours, and, most, these, have, half, lives, less, than, 30, seconds, this, element, also, has, one, meta, state, radioactive, nickel, 56, is, produced, by, the, silicon, burning, process, and, later, set, free, in, large, amounts, in, type, ia, supernovae, the, shape, of, the, light, curve, of, these, supernovae, at, intermediate, to, late, times, corresponds, to, the, decay, via, electron, capture, of, 56, ni, to, cobalt, 56, and, ultimately, to, iron, 56, nickel, 59, is, a, long, lived, cosmogenic, radionuclide, half, life, 76, 000, years, 59, ni, has, found, many, applications, in, isotope, geology, 59, ni, has, been, used, to, date, the, terrestrial, age, of, meteorites, and, to, determine, abundances, of, extraterrestrial, dust, in, ice, and, sediment, nickel, 78, with, a, half, life, of, 110, milliseconds, is, believed, an, important, isotope, in, supernova, nucleosynthesis, of, elements, heavier, than, iron, 48, ni, discovered, in, 1999, is, the, most, proton, rich, heavy, element, isotope, known, with, 28, protons, and, 20, neutrons, 48, ni, is, doubly, magic, as, is, 78, ni, with, 28, protons, and, 50, neutrons, both, are, therefore, unusually, stable, for, nuclei, with, so, large, a, proton, neutron, imbalance, nickel, 63, is, a, contaminant, found, in, the, support, structure, of, nuclear, reactors, it, is, produced, through, neutron, capture, by, nickel, 62, small, amounts, have, also, been, found, near, nuclear, weapon, test, sites, in, the, south, pacific, nickel, ores, are, classified, as, oxides, or, sulfides, oxides, include, laterite, where, the, principal, mineral, mixtures, are, nickeliferous, limonite, fe, ni, o, oh, and, garnierite, a, mixture, of, various, hydrous, nickel, and, nickel, rich, silicates, nickel, sulfides, commonly, exist, as, solid, solutions, with, iron, in, minerals, such, as, pentlandite, and, pyrrhotite, with, the, formula, fe, 9, x, ni, x, s, 8, and, fe, 7, x, ni, x, s, 6, respectively, other, common, ni, containing, minerals, are, millerite, and, the, arsenide, niccolite, identified, land, based, resources, throughout, the, world, averaging, 1, nickel, or, greater, comprise, at, least, 130, million, tons, of, nickel, about, the, double, of, known, reserves, about, 60, is, in, laterites, and, 40, in, sulfide, deposits, on, geophysical, evidence, most, of, the, nickel, on, earth, is, believed, to, be, in, earth, s, outer, and, inner, cores, kamacite, and, taenite, are, naturally, occurring, alloys, of, iron, and, nickel, for, kamacite, the, alloy, is, usually, in, the, proportion, of, 90, 10, to, 95, 5, though, impurities, such, as, cobalt, or, carbon, may, be, present, taenite, is, 20, to, 65, nickel, kamacite, and, taenite, are, also, found, in, nickel, iron, meteorites, nickel, is, commonly, found, in, iron, meteorites, as, the, alloys, kamacite, and, taenite, nickel, in, meteorites, was, first, detected, in, 1799, by, joseph, louis, proust, a, french, chemist, who, then, worked, in, spain, proust, analyzed, samples, of, the, meteorite, from, campo, del, cielo, argentina, which, had, been, obtained, in, 1783, by, miguel, rub, n, de, celis, discovering, the, presence, in, them, of, nickel, about, 10, along, with, iron, the, most, common, oxidation, state, of, nickel, is, 2, but, compounds, of, ni, 0, ni, and, ni, 3, are, well, known, and, the, exotic, oxidation, states, ni, 2, and, ni, have, been, characterized, nickel, tetracarbonyl, ni, co, 4, discovered, by, ludwig, mond, is, a, volatile, highly, toxic, liquid, at, room, temperature, on, heating, the, complex, decomposes, back, to, nickel, and, carbon, monoxide, this, behavior, is, exploited, in, the, mond, process, for, purifying, nickel, as, described, above, the, related, nickel, 0, complex, bis, cyclooctadiene, nickel, 0, is, a, useful, catalyst, in, organonickel, chemistry, because, the, cyclooctadiene, or, cod, ligands, are, easily, displaced, nickel, i, complexes, are, uncommon, but, one, example, is, the, tetrahedral, complex, nibr, pph, 3, 3, many, nickel, i, complexes, have, ni, ni, bonding, such, as, the, dark, red, diamagnetic, k, 4, prepared, by, reduction, of, k, 2, with, sodium, amalgam, this, compound, is, oxidized, in, water, liberating, h, 2, it, is, thought, that, the, nickel, i, oxidation, state, is, important, to, nickel, containing, enzymes, such, as, hydrogenase, which, catalyzes, the, reversible, reduction, of, protons, to, h, 2, nickel, ii, forms, compounds, with, all, common, anions, including, sulfide, sulfate, carbonate, hydroxide, carboxylates, and, halides, nickel, ii, sulfate, is, produced, in, large, amounts, by, dissolving, nickel, metal, or, oxides, in, sulfuric, acid, forming, both, a, hexa, and, heptahydrate, useful, for, electroplating, nickel, common, salts, of, nickel, such, as, chloride, nitrate, and, sulfate, dissolve, in, water, to, give, green, solutions, of, the, metal, aquo, complex, 2, the, four, halides, form, nickel, compounds, which, are, solids, with, molecules, with, octahedral, ni, centres, nickel, ii, chloride, is, most, common, and, its, behavior, is, illustrative, of, the, other, halides, nickel, ii, chloride, is, made, by, dissolving, nickel, or, its, oxide, in, hydrochloric, acid, it, is, usually, found, as, the, green, hexahydrate, whose, formula, is, usually, written, nicl, 2, 6h, 2, o, when, dissolved, in, water, this, salt, forms, the, metal, aquo, complex, 2, dehydration, of, nicl, 2, 6h, 2, o, gives, yellow, anhydrous, nicl, 2, some, tetracoordinate, nickel, ii, complexes, e, g, bis, triphenylphosphine, nickel, chloride, exist, both, in, tetrahedral, and, square, planar, geometries, the, tetrahedral, complexes, are, paramagnetic, the, square, planar, complexes, are, diamagnetic, in, having, properties, of, magnetic, equilibrium, and, formation, of, octahedral, complexes, they, contrast, with, the, divalent, complexes, of, the, heavier, group, 10, metals, palladium, ii, and, platinum, ii, which, form, only, square, planar, geometry, nickelocene, has, an, electron, count, of, 20, many, chemical, reactions, of, nickelocene, tend, to, yield, 18, electron, products, many, ni, iii, compounds, are, known, ni, iii, forms, simple, salts, with, fluoride, or, oxide, ions, ni, iii, can, be, stabilized, by, donor, ligands, such, as, thiols, and, organophosphines, ni, iii, occurs, in, nickel, oxide, hydroxide, which, is, used, as, the, cathode, in, many, rechargeable, batteries, including, nickel, cadmium, nickel, iron, nickel, hydrogen, and, nickel, metal, hydride, and, used, by, certain, manufacturers, in, li, ion, batteries, ni, iv, remains, a, rare, oxidation, state, and, very, few, compounds, are, known, ni, iv, occurs, in, the, mixed, oxide, banio, 3, unintentional, use, of, nickel, can, be, traced, back, as, far, as, 3500, bce, bronzes, from, what, is, now, syria, have, been, found, to, contain, as, much, as, 2, nickel, some, ancient, chinese, manuscripts, suggest, that, white, copper, cupronickel, known, as, baitong, was, used, there, in, 1700, 1400, bce, this, paktong, white, copper, was, exported, to, britain, as, early, as, the, 17th, century, but, the, nickel, content, of, this, alloy, was, not, discovered, until, 1822, coins, of, nickel, copper, alloy, were, minted, by, bactrian, kings, agathocles, euthydemus, ii, and, pantaleon, in, the, 2nd, century, bce, possibly, out, of, the, chinese, cupronickel, in, medieval, germany, a, metallic, yellow, mineral, was, found, in, the, ore, mountains, that, resembled, copper, ore, but, when, miners, were, unable, to, get, any, copper, from, it, they, blamed, a, mischievous, sprite, of, german, mythology, nickel, similar, to, old, nick, for, besetting, the, copper, they, called, this, ore, kupfernickel, from, german, kupfer, copper, this, ore, is, now, known, as, the, mineral, nickeline, formerly, niccolite, a, nickel, arsenide, in, 1751, baron, axel, fredrik, cronstedt, tried, to, extract, copper, from, kupfernickel, at, a, cobalt, mine, in, the, village, of, los, sweden, and, instead, produced, a, white, metal, that, he, named, nickel, after, the, spirit, that, had, given, its, name, to, the, mineral, in, modern, german, kupfernickel, or, kupfer, nickel, designates, the, alloy, cupronickel, originally, the, only, source, for, nickel, was, the, rare, kupfernickel, beginning, in, 1824, nickel, was, obtained, as, a, byproduct, of, cobalt, blue, production, the, first, large, scale, smelting, of, nickel, began, in, norway, in, 1848, from, nickel, rich, pyrrhotite, the, introduction, of, nickel, in, steel, production, in, 1889, increased, the, demand, for, nickel, the, nickel, deposits, of, new, caledonia, discovered, in, 1865, provided, most, of, the, world, s, supply, between, 1875, and, 1915, the, discovery, of, the, large, deposits, in, the, sudbury, basin, in, canada, in, 1883, in, norilsk, talnakh, in, russia, in, 1920, and, in, the, merensky, reef, in, south, africa, in, 1924, made, large, scale, nickel, production, possible, aside, from, the, aforementioned, bactrian, coins, nickel, was, not, a, component, of, coins, until, the, mid, 19th, century, 99, 9, nickel, five, cent, coins, were, struck, in, canada, the, world, s, largest, nickel, producer, at, the, time, during, non, war, years, from, 1922, to, 1981, the, metal, content, made, these, coins, magnetic, during, the, war, years, 1942, 1945, most, or, all, nickel, was, removed, from, canadian, and, us, coins, to, save, it, for, making, armor, canada, used, 99, 9, nickel, from, 1968, in, its, higher, value, coins, until, 2000, coins, of, nearly, pure, nickel, were, first, used, in, 1881, in, switzerland, birmingham, forged, nickel, coins, in, c, 1833, for, trading, in, malaysia, in, the, united, states, the, term, nickel, or, nick, originally, applied, to, the, copper, nickel, flying, eagle, cent, which, replaced, copper, with, 12, nickel, 1857, 58, then, the, indian, head, cent, of, the, same, alloy, from, 1859, to, 1864, still, later, in, 1865, the, term, designated, the, three, cent, nickel, with, nickel, increased, to, 25, in, 1866, the, five, cent, shield, nickel, 25, nickel, 75, copper, appropriated, the, designation, which, has, been, used, ever, since, for, the, subsequent, 5, cent, pieces, this, alloy, proportion, is, not, ferromagnetic, the, us, nickel, coin, contains, 0, 04, ounces, 1, 1, g, of, nickel, which, at, the, april, 2007, price, was, worth, 6, 5, cents, along, with, 3, 75, grams, of, copper, worth, about, 3, cents, with, a, total, metal, value, of, more, than, 9, cents, since, the, face, value, of, a, nickel, is, 5, cents, this, made, it, an, attractive, target, for, melting, by, people, wanting, to, sell, the, metals, at, a, profit, the, united, states, mint, anticipating, this, practice, implemented, new, interim, rules, on, december, 14, 2006, subject, to, public, comment, for, 30, days, which, criminalized, the, melting, and, export, of, cents, and, nickels, violators, can, be, punished, with, a, fine, of, up, to, 10, 000, and, or, a, maximum, of, five, years, in, prison, as, of, september, 19, 2013, the, melt, value, of, a, us, nickel, copper, and, nickel, included, is, 0, 045, 90, of, the, face, value, in, the, 21st, century, the, high, price, of, nickel, has, led, to, some, replacement, of, the, metal, in, coins, around, the, world, coins, still, made, with, nickel, alloys, include, one, and, two, euro, coins, 5, 10, 25, 50, and, 1, u, s, coins, and, 20p, 50p, 1, and, 2, uk, coins, from, 2012, on, the, nickel, alloy, used, for, 5p, and, 10p, uk, coins, was, replaced, with, nickel, plated, steel, this, ignited, a, public, controversy, regarding, the, problems, of, people, with, nickel, allergy, an, estimated, 3, 3, million, tonnes, t, of, nickel, per, year, are, mined, worldwide, indonesia, 1, 600, 000, t, the, philippines, 330, 000, t, russia, 220, 000, t, new, caledonia, france, 190, 000, t, australia, 160, 000, t, and, canada, 130, 000, t, are, the, largest, producers, as, of, 2022, the, largest, nickel, deposits, in, non, russian, europe, are, in, finland, and, greece, identified, land, based, sources, averaging, at, least, 1, nickel, contain, at, least, 130, million, tonnes, of, nickel, about, 60, is, in, laterites, and, 40, is, in, sulfide, deposits, also, extensive, nickel, sources, are, found, in, the, depths, of, the, pacific, ocean, especially, in, an, area, called, the, clarion, clipperton, zone, in, the, form, of, polymetallic, nodules, peppering, the, seafloor, at, 3, 5, 6, km, below, sea, level, these, nodules, are, composed, of, numerous, rare, earth, metals, and, are, estimated, to, be, 1, 7, nickel, with, advances, in, science, and, engineering, regulation, is, currently, being, set, in, place, by, the, international, seabed, authority, to, ensure, that, these, nodules, are, collected, in, an, environmentally, conscientious, manner, while, adhering, to, the, united, nations, sustainable, development, goals, the, one, place, in, the, united, states, where, nickel, has, been, profitably, mined, is, riddle, oregon, with, several, square, miles, of, nickel, bearing, garnierite, surface, deposits, the, mine, closed, in, 1987, the, eagle, mine, project, is, a, new, nickel, mine, in, michigan, s, upper, peninsula, construction, was, completed, in, 2013, and, operations, began, in, the, third, quarter, of, 2014, in, the, first, full, year, of, operation, the, eagle, mine, produced, 18, 000, t, nickel, is, obtained, through, extractive, metallurgy, it, is, extracted, from, ore, by, conventional, roasting, and, reduction, processes, that, yield, metal, of, greater, than, 75, purity, in, many, stainless, steel, applications, 75, pure, nickel, can, be, used, without, further, purification, depending, on, impurities, traditionally, most, sulfide, ores, are, processed, using, pyrometallurgical, techniques, to, produce, a, matte, for, further, refining, hydrometallurgical, techniques, are, also, used, most, sulfide, deposits, have, traditionally, been, processed, by, concentration, through, a, froth, flotation, process, followed, by, pyrometallurgical, extraction, the, nickel, matte, is, further, processed, with, the, sherritt, gordon, process, first, copper, is, removed, by, adding, hydrogen, sulfide, leaving, a, concentrate, of, cobalt, and, nickel, then, solvent, extraction, is, used, to, separate, the, cobalt, and, nickel, with, the, final, nickel, content, greater, than, 86, a, second, common, refining, process, is, leaching, the, metal, matte, into, a, nickel, salt, solution, followed, by, electrowinning, the, nickel, from, solution, by, plating, it, onto, a, cathode, as, electrolytic, nickel, the, purest, metal, is, obtained, from, nickel, oxide, by, the, mond, process, which, gives, a, purity, of, over, 99, 99, the, process, was, patented, by, ludwig, mond, and, has, been, in, industrial, use, since, before, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, in, this, process, nickel, is, treated, with, carbon, monoxide, in, the, presence, of, a, sulfur, catalyst, at, around, 40, 80, c, to, form, nickel, carbonyl, in, a, similar, reaction, with, iron, iron, pentacarbonyl, can, form, though, this, reaction, is, slow, if, necessary, the, nickel, may, be, separated, by, distillation, dicobalt, octacarbonyl, is, also, formed, in, nickel, distillation, as, a, by, product, but, it, decomposes, to, tetracobalt, dodecacarbonyl, at, the, reaction, temperature, to, give, a, non, volatile, solid, nickel, is, obtained, from, nickel, carbonyl, by, one, of, two, processes, it, may, be, passed, through, a, large, chamber, at, high, temperatures, in, which, tens, of, thousands, of, nickel, spheres, pellets, are, constantly, stirred, the, carbonyl, decomposes, and, deposits, pure, nickel, onto, the, spheres, in, the, alternate, process, nickel, carbonyl, is, decomposed, in, a, smaller, chamber, at, 230, c, to, create, a, fine, nickel, powder, the, byproduct, carbon, monoxide, is, recirculated, and, reused, the, highly, pure, nickel, product, is, known, as, carbonyl, nickel, the, market, price, of, nickel, surged, throughout, 2006, and, the, early, months, of, 2007, as, of, april, 5, 2007, the, metal, was, trading, at, us, 52, 300, tonne, or, 1, 47, oz, the, price, later, fell, dramatically, as, of, september, 2017, the, metal, was, trading, at, 11, 000, tonne, or, 0, 31, oz, during, the, 2022, russian, invasion, of, ukraine, worries, about, sanctions, on, russian, nickel, exports, triggered, a, short, squeeze, causing, the, price, of, nickel, to, quadruple, in, just, two, days, reaching, us, 100, 000, per, tonne, the, london, metal, exchange, cancelled, contracts, worth, 3, 9, billion, and, suspended, nickel, trading, for, over, a, week, analyst, andy, home, argued, that, such, price, shocks, are, exacerbated, by, the, purity, requirements, imposed, by, metal, markets, only, grade, i, 99, 8, pure, metal, can, be, used, as, a, commodity, on, the, exchanges, but, most, of, the, world, s, supply, is, either, in, ferro, nickel, alloys, or, lower, grade, purities, global, use, of, nickel, is, currently, 68, in, stainless, steel, 10, in, nonferrous, alloys, 9, electroplating, 7, alloy, steel, 3, foundries, and, 4, other, including, batteries, nickel, is, used, in, many, recognizable, industrial, and, consumer, products, including, stainless, steel, alnico, magnets, coinage, rechargeable, batteries, e, g, nickel, iron, electric, guitar, strings, microphone, capsules, plating, on, plumbing, fixtures, and, special, alloys, such, as, permalloy, elinvar, and, invar, it, is, used, for, plating, and, as, a, green, tint, in, glass, nickel, is, preeminently, an, alloy, metal, and, its, chief, use, is, in, nickel, steels, and, nickel, cast, irons, in, which, it, typically, increases, the, tensile, strength, toughness, and, elastic, limit, it, is, widely, used, in, many, other, alloys, including, nickel, brasses, and, bronzes, and, alloys, with, copper, chromium, aluminium, lead, cobalt, silver, and, gold, inconel, incoloy, monel, nimonic, because, nickel, is, resistant, to, corrosion, it, was, occasionally, used, as, a, substitute, for, decorative, silver, nickel, was, also, occasionally, used, in, some, countries, after, 1859, as, a, cheap, coinage, metal, see, above, but, in, the, later, years, of, the, 20th, century, it, was, replaced, by, cheaper, stainless, steel, i, e, iron, alloys, except, in, the, united, states, and, canada, nickel, is, an, excellent, alloying, agent, for, certain, precious, metals, and, is, used, in, the, fire, assay, as, a, collector, of, platinum, group, elements, pge, as, such, nickel, can, fully, collect, all, six, pges, from,

carcinogenicity, of, nickel, compounds, to, respiratory, tumours, after, inhalation, nickel, metal, is, classified, as, a, suspect, carcinogen, there, is, consistency, between, the, absence, of, increased, respiratory, cancer, risks, in, workers, predominantly, exposed, to, metallic, nickel, and, the, lack, of, respiratory, tumours, in, a, rat, lifetime, inhalation, carcinogenicity, study, with, nickel, metal, powder, in, the, rodent, inhalation, studies, with, various, nickel, compounds, and, nickel, metal, increased, lung, inflammations, with, and, without, bronchial, lymph, node, hyperplasia, or, fibrosis, were, observed, in, rat, studies, oral, ingestion, of, water, soluble, nickel, salts, can, trigger, perinatal, mortality, in, pregnant, animals, whether, these, effects, are, relevant, to, humans, is, unclear, as, epidemiological, studies, of, highly, exposed, female, workers, have, not, shown, adverse, developmental, toxicity, effects, people, can, be, exposed, to, nickel, in, the, workplace, by, inhalation, ingestion, and, contact, with, skin, or, eye, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, has, set, the, legal, limit, permissible, exposure, limit, for, the, workplace, at, 1, mg, m, 3, per, 8, hour, workday, excluding, nickel, carbonyl, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, sets, the, recommended, exposure, limit, rel, at, 0, 015, mg, m, 3, per, 8, hour, workday, at, 10, mg, m, 3, nickel, is, immediately, dangerous, to, life, and, health, nickel, carbonyl, is, an, extremely, toxic, gas, the, toxicity, of, metal, carbonyls, is, a, function, of, both, the, toxicity, of, the, metal, and, the, off, gassing, of, carbon, monoxide, from, the, carbonyl, functional, groups, nickel, carbonyl, is, also, explosive, in, air, sensitized, persons, may, show, a, skin, contact, allergy, to, nickel, known, as, a, contact, dermatitis, highly, sensitized, persons, may, also, react, to, foods, with, high, nickel, content, patients, with, pompholyx, may, also, be, sensitive, to, nickel, nickel, is, the, top, confirmed, contact, allergen, worldwide, partly, due, to, its, use, in, jewelry, for, pierced, ears, nickel, allergies, affecting, pierced, ears, are, often, marked, by, itchy, red, skin, many, earrings, are, now, made, without, nickel, or, with, low, release, nickel, to, address, this, problem, the, amount, allowed, in, products, that, contact, human, skin, is, now, regulated, by, the, european, union, in, 2002, researchers, found, that, the, nickel, released, by, 1, and, 2, euro, coins, far, exceeded, those, standards, this, is, believed, to, be, due, to, a, galvanic, reaction, nickel, was, voted, allergen, of, the, year, in, 2008, by, the, american, contact, dermatitis, society, in, august, 2015, the, american, academy, of, dermatology, adopted, a, position, statement, on, the, safety, of, nickel, estimates, suggest, that, contact, dermatitis, which, includes, nickel, sensitization, accounts, for, approximately, 1, 918, billion, and, affects, nearly, 72, 29, million, people, reports, show, that, both, the, nickel, induced, activation, of, hypoxia, inducible, factor, hif, 1, and, the, up, regulation, of, hypoxia, inducible, genes, are, caused, by, depletion, of, intracellular, ascorbate, the, addition, of, ascorbate, to, the, culture, medium, increased, the, intracellular, ascorbate, level, and, reversed, both, the, metal, induced, stabilization, of, hif, 1, and, hif, 1, dependent, gene, expression, in, the, second, oz, book, the, marvelous, land, of, oz, by, l, frank, baum, published, by, reilly, britton, 1904, the, tin, woodman, states, that, he, has, had, his, tin, body, nickel, plated, he, is, thereafter, very, careful, not, to, allow, his, nickel, plating, to, get, scratched, nicked, or, marred
