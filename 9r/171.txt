the, horizon, is, the, apparent, curve, that, separates, the, surface, of, a, celestial, body, from, its, sky, when, viewed, from, the, perspective, of, an, observer, on, or, near, the, surface, of, the, relevant, body, this, curve, divides, all, viewing, directions, based, on, whether, it, intersects, the, relevant, body, s, surface, or, not, the, true, horizon, is, a, theoretical, line, which, can, only, be, observed, to, any, degree, of, accuracy, when, it, lies, along, a, relatively, smooth, surface, such, as, that, of, earth, s, oceans, at, many, locations, this, line, is, obscured, by, terrain, and, on, earth, it, can, also, be, obscured, by, life, forms, such, as, trees, and, or, human, constructs, such, as, buildings, the, resulting, intersection, of, such, obstructions, with, the, sky, is, called, the, visible, horizon, on, earth, when, looking, at, a, sea, from, a, shore, the, part, of, the, sea, closest, to, the, horizon, is, called, the, offing, the, true, horizon, surrounds, the, observer, and, it, is, typically, assumed, to, be, a, circle, drawn, on, the, surface, of, a, perfectly, spherical, model, of, the, relevant, celestial, body, i, e, a, small, circle, of, the, local, osculating, sphere, with, respect, to, earth, the, center, of, the, true, horizon, is, below, the, observer, and, below, sea, level, its, radius, or, horizontal, distance, from, the, observer, varies, slightly, from, day, to, day, due, to, atmospheric, refraction, which, is, greatly, affected, by, weather, conditions, also, the, higher, the, observer, s, eyes, are, from, sea, level, the, farther, away, the, horizon, is, from, the, observer, for, instance, in, standard, atmospheric, conditions, for, an, observer, with, eye, level, above, sea, level, by, 1, 8, metres, 6, ft, the, horizon, is, at, a, distance, of, about, 4, 8, kilometres, 3, mi, when, observed, from, very, high, standpoints, such, as, a, space, station, the, horizon, is, much, farther, away, and, it, encompasses, a, much, larger, area, of, earth, s, surface, in, this, case, the, horizon, would, no, longer, be, a, perfect, circle, not, even, a, plane, curve, such, as, an, ellipse, especially, when, the, observer, is, above, the, equator, as, the, earth, s, surface, can, be, better, modeled, as, an, oblate, ellipsoid, than, as, a, sphere, the, word, horizon, derives, from, the, greek, hor, z, n, k, klos, separating, circle, where, is, from, the, verb, hor, z, to, divide, to, separate, which, in, turn, derives, from, h, ros, boundary, landmark, historically, the, distance, to, the, visible, horizon, has, long, been, vital, to, survival, and, successful, navigation, especially, at, sea, because, it, determined, an, observer, s, maximum, range, of, vision, and, thus, of, communication, with, all, the, obvious, consequences, for, safety, and, the, transmission, of, information, that, this, range, implied, this, importance, lessened, with, the, development, of, the, radio, and, the, telegraph, but, even, today, when, flying, an, aircraft, under, visual, flight, rules, a, technique, called, attitude, flying, is, used, to, control, the, aircraft, where, the, pilot, uses, the, visual, relationship, between, the, aircraft, s, nose, and, the, horizon, to, control, the, aircraft, pilots, can, also, retain, their, spatial, orientation, by, referring, to, the, horizon, in, many, contexts, especially, perspective, drawing, the, curvature, of, the, earth, is, disregarded, and, the, horizon, is, considered, the, theoretical, line, to, which, points, on, any, horizontal, plane, converge, when, projected, onto, the, picture, plane, as, their, distance, from, the, observer, increases, for, observers, near, sea, level, the, difference, between, this, geometrical, horizon, which, assumes, a, perfectly, flat, infinite, ground, plane, and, the, true, horizon, which, assumes, a, spherical, earth, surface, is, imperceptible, to, the, unaided, eye, however, for, someone, on, a, 1, 000, m, 3, 300, ft, hill, looking, out, across, the, sea, the, true, horizon, will, be, about, a, degree, below, a, horizontal, line, in, astronomy, the, horizon, is, the, horizontal, plane, through, the, eyes, of, the, observer, it, is, the, fundamental, plane, of, the, horizontal, coordinate, system, the, locus, of, points, that, have, an, altitude, of, zero, degrees, while, similar, in, ways, to, the, geometrical, horizon, in, this, context, a, horizon, may, be, considered, to, be, a, plane, in, space, rather, than, a, line, on, a, picture, plane, ignoring, the, effect, of, atmospheric, refraction, distance, to, the, true, horizon, from, an, observer, close, to, the, earth, s, surface, is, about, where, h, is, height, above, sea, level, and, r, is, the, earth, radius, the, expression, can, be, simplified, as, where, the, constant, equals, k, 3, 57, km, m, 1, 22, mi, ft, in, this, equation, earth, s, surface, is, assumed, to, be, perfectly, spherical, with, r, equal, to, about, 6, 371, kilometres, 3, 959, mi, assuming, no, atmospheric, refraction, and, a, spherical, earth, with, radius, r, 6, 371, kilometres, 3, 959, mi, on, terrestrial, planets, and, other, solid, celestial, bodies, with, negligible, atmospheric, effects, the, distance, to, the, horizon, for, a, standard, observer, varies, as, the, square, root, of, the, planet, s, radius, thus, the, horizon, on, mercury, is, 62, as, far, away, from, the, observer, as, it, is, on, earth, on, mars, the, figure, is, 73, on, the, moon, the, figure, is, 52, on, mimas, the, figure, is, 18, and, so, on, if, the, earth, is, assumed, to, be, a, featureless, sphere, rather, than, an, oblate, spheroid, with, no, atmospheric, refraction, then, the, distance, to, the, horizon, can, easily, be, calculated, the, tangent, secant, theorem, states, that, make, the, following, substitutions, with, d, d, and, h, all, measured, in, the, same, units, the, formula, now, becomes, or, where, r, is, the, radius, of, the, earth, the, same, equation, can, also, be, derived, using, the, pythagorean, theorem, at, the, horizon, the, line, of, sight, is, a, tangent, to, the, earth, and, is, also, perpendicular, to, earth, s, radius, this, sets, up, a, right, triangle, with, the, sum, of, the, radius, and, the, height, as, the, hypotenuse, with, referring, to, the, second, figure, at, the, right, leads, to, the, following, the, exact, formula, above, can, be, expanded, as, where, r, is, the, radius, of, the, earth, r, and, h, must, be, in, the, same, units, for, example, if, a, satellite, is, at, a, height, of, 2000, km, the, distance, to, the, horizon, is, 5, 430, kilometres, 3, 370, mi, neglecting, the, second, term, in, parentheses, would, give, a, distance, of, 5, 048, kilometres, 3, 137, mi, a, 7, error, if, the, observer, is, close, to, the, surface, of, the, earth, then, it, is, valid, to, disregard, h, in, the, term, 2, r, h, and, the, formula, becomes, using, kilometres, for, d, and, r, and, metres, for, h, and, taking, the, radius, of, the, earth, as, 6371, km, the, distance, to, the, horizon, is, using, imperial, units, with, d, and, r, in, statute, miles, as, commonly, used, on, land, and, h, in, feet, the, distance, to, the, horizon, is, if, d, is, in, nautical, miles, and, h, in, feet, the, constant, factor, is, about, 1, 06, which, is, close, enough, to, 1, that, it, is, often, ignored, giving, these, formulas, may, be, used, when, h, is, much, smaller, than, the, radius, of, the, earth, 6371, km, or, 3959, mi, including, all, views, from, any, mountaintops, airplanes, or, high, altitude, balloons, with, the, constants, as, given, both, the, metric, and, imperial, formulas, are, precise, to, within, 1, see, the, next, section, for, how, to, obtain, greater, precision, if, h, is, significant, with, respect, to, r, as, with, most, satellites, then, the, approximation, is, no, longer, valid, and, the, exact, formula, is, required, another, relationship, involves, the, great, circle, distance, s, along, the, arc, over, the, curved, surface, of, the, earth, to, the, horizon, this, is, more, directly, comparable, to, the, geographical, distance, on, a, map, it, can, be, formulated, in, terms, of, in, radians, then, solving, for, s, gives, the, distance, s, can, also, be, expressed, in, terms, of, the, line, of, sight, distance, d, from, the, second, figure, at, the, right, substituting, for, and, rearranging, gives, the, distances, d, and, s, are, nearly, the, same, when, the, height, of, the, object, is, negligible, compared, to, the, radius, that, is, h, r, when, the, observer, is, elevated, the, horizon, zenith, angle, can, be, greater, than, 90, the, maximum, visible, zenith, angle, occurs, when, the, ray, is, tangent, to, earth, s, surface, from, triangle, ocg, in, the, figure, at, right, where, h, displaystyle, h, is, the, observer, s, height, above, the, surface, and, displaystyle, gamma, is, the, angular, dip, of, the, horizon, it, is, related, to, the, horizon, zenith, angle, z, displaystyle, z, by, for, a, non, negative, height, h, displaystyle, h, the, angle, z, displaystyle, z, is, always, 90, to, compute, the, greatest, distance, d, bl, at, which, an, observer, b, can, see, the, top, of, an, object, l, above, the, horizon, simply, add, the, distances, to, the, horizon, from, each, of, the, two, points, for, example, for, an, observer, b, with, a, height, of, h, b, 1, 70, m, standing, on, the, ground, the, horizon, is, d, b, 4, 65, km, away, for, a, tower, with, a, height, of, h, l, 100, m, the, horizon, distance, is, d, l, 35, 7, km, thus, an, observer, on, a, beach, can, see, the, top, of, the, tower, as, long, as, it, is, not, more, than, d, bl, 40, 35, km, away, conversely, if, an, observer, on, a, boat, h, b, 1, 7, m, can, just, see, the, tops, of, trees, on, a, nearby, shore, h, l, 10, m, the, trees, are, probably, about, d, bl, 16, km, away, referring, to, the, figure, at, the, right, and, using, the, approximation, above, the, top, of, the, lighthouse, will, be, visible, to, a, lookout, in, a, crow, s, nest, at, the, top, of, a, mast, of, the, boat, if, where, d, bl, is, in, kilometres, and, h, b, and, h, l, are, in, metres, as, another, example, suppose, an, observer, whose, eyes, are, two, metres, above, the, level, ground, uses, binoculars, to, look, at, a, distant, building, which, he, knows, to, consist, of, thirty, storeys, each, 3, 5, metres, high, he, counts, the, stories, he, can, see, and, finds, there, are, only, ten, so, twenty, stories, or, 70, metres, of, the, building, are, hidden, from, him, by, the, curvature, of, the, earth, from, this, he, can, calculate, his, distance, from, the, building, which, comes, to, about, 35, kilometres, it, is, similarly, possible, to, calculate, how, much, of, a, distant, object, is, visible, above, the, horizon, suppose, an, observer, s, eye, is, 10, metres, above, sea, level, and, he, is, watching, a, ship, that, is, 20, km, away, his, horizon, is, kilometres, from, him, which, comes, to, about, 11, 3, kilometres, away, the, ship, is, a, further, 8, 7, km, away, the, height, of, a, point, on, the, ship, that, is, just, visible, to, the, observer, is, given, by, which, comes, to, almost, exactly, six, metres, the, observer, can, therefore, see, that, part, of, the, ship, that, is, more, than, six, metres, above, the, level, of, the, water, the, part, of, the, ship, that, is, below, this, height, is, hidden, from, him, by, the, curvature, of, the, earth, in, this, situation, the, ship, is, said, to, be, hull, down, due, to, atmospheric, refraction, the, distance, to, the, visible, horizon, is, further, than, the, distance, based, on, a, simple, geometric, calculation, if, the, ground, or, water, surface, is, colder, than, the, air, above, it, a, cold, dense, layer, of, air, forms, close, to, the, surface, causing, light, to, be, refracted, downward, as, it, travels, and, therefore, to, some, extent, to, go, around, the, curvature, of, the, earth, the, reverse, happens, if, the, ground, is, hotter, than, the, air, above, it, as, often, happens, in, deserts, producing, mirages, as, an, approximate, compensation, for, refraction, surveyors, measuring, distances, longer, than, 100, meters, subtract, 14, from, the, calculated, curvature, error, and, ensure, lines, of, sight, are, at, least, 1, 5, metres, from, the, ground, to, reduce, random, errors, created, by, refraction, if, the, earth, were, an, airless, world, like, the, moon, the, above, calculations, would, be, accurate, however, earth, has, an, atmosphere, of, air, whose, density, and, refractive, index, vary, considerably, depending, on, the, temperature, and, pressure, this, makes, the, air, refract, light, to, varying, extents, affecting, the, appearance, of, the, horizon, usually, the, density, of, the, air, just, above, the, surface, of, the, earth, is, greater, than, its, density, at, greater, altitudes, this, makes, its, refractive, index, greater, near, the, surface, than, at, higher, altitudes, which, causes, light, that, is, travelling, roughly, horizontally, to, be, refracted, downward, this, makes, the, actual, distance, to, the, horizon, greater, than, the, distance, calculated, with, geometrical, formulas, with, standard, atmospheric, conditions, the, difference, is, about, 8, this, changes, the, factor, of, 3, 57, in, the, metric, formulas, used, above, to, about, 3, 86, for, instance, if, an, observer, is, standing, on, seashore, with, eyes, 1, 70, m, above, sea, level, according, to, the, simple, geometrical, formulas, given, above, the, horizon, should, be, 4, 7, km, away, actually, atmospheric, refraction, allows, the, observer, to, see, 300, metres, farther, moving, the, true, horizon, 5, km, away, from, the, observer, this, correction, can, be, and, often, is, applied, as, a, fairly, good, approximation, when, atmospheric, conditions, are, close, to, standard, when, conditions, are, unusual, this, approximation, fails, refraction, is, strongly, affected, by, temperature, gradients, which, can, vary, considerably, from, day, to, day, especially, over, water, in, extreme, cases, usually, in, springtime, when, warm, air, overlies, cold, water, refraction, can, allow, light, to, follow, the, earth, s, surface, for, hundreds, of, kilometres, opposite, conditions, occur, for, example, in, deserts, where, the, surface, is, very, hot, so, hot, low, density, air, is, below, cooler, air, this, causes, light, to, be, refracted, upward, causing, mirage, effects, that, make, the, concept, of, the, horizon, somewhat, meaningless, calculated, values, for, the, effects, of, refraction, under, unusual, conditions, are, therefore, only, approximate, nevertheless, attempts, have, been, made, to, calculate, them, more, accurately, than, the, simple, approximation, described, above, outside, the, visual, wavelength, range, refraction, will, be, different, for, radar, e, g, for, wavelengths, 300, to, 3, mm, i, e, frequencies, between, 1, and, 100, ghz, the, radius, of, the, earth, may, be, multiplied, by, 4, 3, to, obtain, an, effective, radius, giving, a, factor, of, 4, 12, in, the, metric, formula, i, e, the, radar, horizon, will, be, 15, beyond, the, geometrical, horizon, or, 7, beyond, the, visual, the, 4, 3, factor, is, not, exact, as, in, the, visual, case, the, refraction, depends, on, atmospheric, conditions, if, the, density, profile, of, the, atmosphere, is, known, the, distance, d, to, the, horizon, is, given, by, where, r, e, is, the, radius, of, the, earth, is, the, dip, of, the, horizon, and, is, the, refraction, of, the, horizon, the, dip, is, determined, fairly, simply, from, where, h, is, the, observer, s, height, above, the, earth, is, the, index, of, refraction, of, air, at, the, observer, s, height, and, 0, is, the, index, of, refraction, of, air, at, earth, s, surface, the, refraction, must, be, found, by, integration, of, where, displaystyle, phi, is, the, angle, between, the, ray, and, a, line, through, the, center, of, the, earth, the, angles, and, displaystyle, phi, are, related, by, a, much, simpler, approach, which, produces, essentially, the, same, results, as, the, first, order, approximation, described, above, uses, the, geometrical, model, but, uses, a, radius, r, 7, 6, r, e, the, distance, to, the, horizon, is, then, taking, the, radius, of, the, earth, as, 6371, km, with, d, in, km, and, h, in, m, with, d, in, mi, and, h, in, ft, in, the, case, of, radar, one, typically, has, r, 4, 3, r, e, resulting, with, d, in, km, and, h, in, m, in, results, from, young, s, method, are, quite, close, to, those, from, sweer, s, method, and, are, sufficiently, accurate, for, many, purposes, the, horizon, is, a, key, feature, of, the, picture, plane, in, the, science, of, graphical, perspective, assuming, the, picture, plane, stands, vertical, to, ground, and, p, is, the, perpendicular, projection, of, the, eye, point, o, on, the, picture, plane, the, horizon, is, defined, as, the, horizontal, line, through, p, the, point, p, is, the, vanishing, point, of, lines, perpendicular, to, the, picture, if, s, is, another, point, on, the, horizon, then, it, is, the, vanishing, point, for, all, lines, parallel, to, os, but, brook, taylor, 1719, indicated, that, the, horizon, plane, determined, by, o, and, the, horizon, was, like, any, other, plane, the, peculiar, geometry, of, perspective, where, parallel, lines, converge, in, the, distance, stimulated, the, development, of, projective, geometry, which, posits, a, point, at, infinity, where, parallel, lines, meet, in, her, book, geometry, of, an, art, 2007, kirsti, andersen, described, the, evolution, of, perspective, drawing, and, science, up, to, 1800, noting, that, vanishing, points, need, not, be, on, the, horizon, in, a, chapter, titled, horizon, john, stillwell, recounted, how, projective, geometry, has, led, to, incidence, geometry, the, modern, abstract, study, of, line, intersection, stillwell, also, ventured, into, foundations, of, mathematics, in, a, section, titled, what, are, the, laws, of, algebra, the, algebra, of, points, originally, given, by, karl, von, staudt, deriving, the, axioms, of, a, field, was, deconstructed, in, the, twentieth, century, yielding, a, wide, variety, of, mathematical, possibilities, stillwell, states
