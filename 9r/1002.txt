the, navier, stokes, equations, n, v, j, e, s, t, o, k, s, nav, yay, stohks, are, partial, differential, equations, which, describe, the, motion, of, viscous, fluid, substances, they, were, named, after, french, engineer, and, physicist, claude, louis, navier, and, the, irish, physicist, and, mathematician, george, gabriel, stokes, they, were, developed, over, several, decades, of, progressively, building, the, theories, from, 1822, navier, to, 1842, 1850, stokes, the, navier, stokes, equations, mathematically, express, momentum, balance, for, newtonian, fluids, and, make, use, of, conservation, of, mass, they, are, sometimes, accompanied, by, an, equation, of, state, relating, pressure, temperature, and, density, they, arise, from, applying, isaac, newton, s, second, law, to, fluid, motion, together, with, the, assumption, that, the, stress, in, the, fluid, is, the, sum, of, a, diffusing, viscous, term, proportional, to, the, gradient, of, velocity, and, a, pressure, term, hence, describing, viscous, flow, the, difference, between, them, and, the, closely, related, euler, equations, is, that, navier, stokes, equations, take, viscosity, into, account, while, the, euler, equations, model, only, inviscid, flow, as, a, result, the, navier, stokes, are, a, parabolic, equation, and, therefore, have, better, analytic, properties, at, the, expense, of, having, less, mathematical, structure, e, g, they, are, never, completely, integrable, the, navier, stokes, equations, are, useful, because, they, describe, the, physics, of, many, phenomena, of, scientific, and, engineering, interest, they, may, be, used, to, model, the, weather, ocean, currents, water, flow, in, a, pipe, and, air, flow, around, a, wing, the, navier, stokes, equations, in, their, full, and, simplified, forms, help, with, the, design, of, aircraft, and, cars, the, study, of, blood, flow, the, design, of, power, stations, the, analysis, of, pollution, and, many, other, problems, coupled, with, maxwell, s, equations, they, can, be, used, to, model, and, study, magnetohydrodynamics, the, navier, stokes, equations, are, also, of, great, interest, in, a, purely, mathematical, sense, despite, their, wide, range, of, practical, uses, it, has, not, yet, been, proven, whether, smooth, solutions, always, exist, in, three, dimensions, i, e, whether, they, are, infinitely, differentiable, or, even, just, bounded, at, all, points, in, the, domain, this, is, called, the, navier, stokes, existence, and, smoothness, problem, the, clay, mathematics, institute, has, called, this, one, of, the, seven, most, important, open, problems, in, mathematics, and, has, offered, a, us, 1, million, prize, for, a, solution, or, a, counterexample, the, solution, of, the, equations, is, a, flow, velocity, it, is, a, vector, field, to, every, point, in, a, fluid, at, any, moment, in, a, time, interval, it, gives, a, vector, whose, direction, and, magnitude, are, those, of, the, velocity, of, the, fluid, at, that, point, in, space, and, at, that, moment, in, time, it, is, usually, studied, in, three, spatial, dimensions, and, one, time, dimension, although, two, spatial, dimensional, and, steady, state, cases, are, often, used, as, models, and, higher, dimensional, analogues, are, studied, in, both, pure, and, applied, mathematics, once, the, velocity, field, is, calculated, other, quantities, of, interest, such, as, pressure, or, temperature, may, be, found, using, dynamical, equations, and, relations, this, is, different, from, what, one, normally, sees, in, classical, mechanics, where, solutions, are, typically, trajectories, of, position, of, a, particle, or, deflection, of, a, continuum, studying, velocity, instead, of, position, makes, more, sense, for, a, fluid, although, for, visualization, purposes, one, can, compute, various, trajectories, in, particular, the, streamlines, of, a, vector, field, interpreted, as, flow, velocity, are, the, paths, along, which, a, massless, fluid, particle, would, travel, these, paths, are, the, integral, curves, whose, derivative, at, each, point, is, equal, to, the, vector, field, and, they, can, represent, visually, the, behavior, of, the, vector, field, at, a, point, in, time, the, navier, stokes, momentum, equation, can, be, derived, as, a, particular, form, of, the, cauchy, momentum, equation, whose, general, convective, form, is, d, u, d, t, 1, g, displaystyle, frac, mathrm, d, mathbf, u, mathrm, d, t, frac, 1, rho, nabla, cdot, boldsymbol, sigma, mathbf, g, by, setting, the, cauchy, stress, tensor, textstyle, boldsymbol, sigma, to, be, the, sum, of, a, viscosity, term, textstyle, boldsymbol, tau, the, deviatoric, stress, and, a, pressure, term, p, i, textstyle, p, mathbf,

is, apparent, that, in, the, assumption, of, an, inviscid, fluid, no, deviatoric, stress, cauchy, equations, reduce, to, the, euler, equations, assuming, conservation, of, mass, with, the, known, properties, of, divergence, and, gradient, we, can, use, the, mass, continuity, equation, which, represents, the, mass, per, unit, volume, of, a, homogenous, fluid, with, respect, to, space, and, time, i, e, material, derivative, d, d, t, displaystyle, frac, mathbf, d, mathbf, dt, of, any, finite, volume, v, to, represent, the, change, of, velocity, in, fluid, media, d, m, d, t, v, d, d, t, u,

if, present, the, right, side, of, the, equation, is, in, effect, a, summation, of, hydrostatic, effects, the, divergence, of, deviatoric, stress, and, body, forces, such, as, gravity, all, non, relativistic, balance, equations, such, as, the, navier, stokes, equations, can, be, derived, by, beginning, with, the, cauchy, equations, and, specifying, the, stress, tensor, through, a, constitutive, relation, by, expressing, the, deviatoric, shear, stress, tensor, in, terms, of, viscosity, and, the, fluid, velocity, gradient, and, assuming, constant, viscosity, the, above, cauchy, equations, will, lead, to, the, navier, stokes, equations, below, a, significant, feature, of, the, cauchy, equation, and, consequently, all, other, continuum, equations, including, euler, and, navier, stokes, is, the, presence, of, convective, acceleration, the, effect, of, acceleration, of, a, flow, with, respect, to, space, while, individual, fluid, particles, indeed, experience, time, dependent, acceleration, the, convective, acceleration, of, the, flow, field, is, a, spatial, effect, one, example, being, fluid, speeding, up, in, a, nozzle, remark, here, the, deviatoric, stress, tensor, is, denoted, textstyle, boldsymbol, tau, as, it, was, in, the, general, continuum, equations, and, in, the, incompressible, flow, section, the, compressible, momentum, navier, stokes, equation, results, from, the, following, assumptions, on, the, cauchy, stress, tensor, p, i, tr, i, 2, displaystyle, boldsymbol, sigma, boldsymbol, varepsilon, p, mathbf, i, lambda, operatorname, tr, boldsymbol, varepsilon, mathbf, i, 2, mu, boldsymbol, varepsilon, where, i, textstyle, mathbf, i, is, the, identity, tensor, and, tr, textstyle, operatorname, tr, boldsymbol, varepsilon, is, the, trace, of, the, rate, of, strain, tensor, so, this, decomposition, can, be, explicitly, defined, as, p, i, u, i, u, u, t, displaystyle, boldsymbol, sigma, p, mathbf, i, lambda, nabla, cdot, mathbf, u, mathbf, i, mu, left, nabla, mathbf, u, nabla, mathbf, u, mathrm, t, right, since, the, trace, of, the, rate, of, strain, tensor, in, three, dimensions, is, the, divergence, i, e, rate, of, expansion, of, the, flow, tr, u, displaystyle, operatorname, tr, boldsymbol, varepsilon, nabla, cdot, mathbf, u, given, this, relation, and, since, the, trace, of, the, identity, tensor, in, three, dimensions, is, three, tr, i, 3, displaystyle, operatorname, tr, boldsymbol, i, 3, the, trace, of, the, stress, tensor, in, three, dimensions, becomes, tr, 3, p, 3, 2, u, displaystyle, operatorname, tr, boldsymbol, sigma, 3p, 3, lambda, 2, mu, nabla, cdot, mathbf, u, so, by, alternatively, decomposing, the, stress, tensor, into, isotropic, and, deviatoric, parts, as, usual, in, fluid, dynamics, p, 2,

mathbf, i, right, introducing, the, bulk, viscosity, textstyle, zeta, 2, 3, displaystyle, zeta, equiv, lambda, tfrac, 2, 3, mu, we, arrive, to, the, linear, constitutive, equation, in, the, form, usually, employed, in, thermal, hydraulics, p, u, i, u, u, t, 2, 3, u, i, displaystyle, boldsymbol, sigma, mathbf, i, mu, left, which, can, also, be, arranged, in, the, other, usual, form, p, i, u, u,

note, that, in, the, compressible, case, the, pressure, is, no, more, proportional, to, the, isotropic, stress, term, since, there, is, the, additional, bulk, viscosity, term, p, 1, 3, tr, u, displaystyle, p, frac, 1, 3, operatorname, tr, boldsymbol, sigma, zeta, nabla, cdot, mathbf, u, and, the, deviatoric, stress, tensor, displaystyle, boldsymbol, sigma, is, still, coincident, with, the, shear, stress, tensor, displaystyle, boldsymbol, tau, i, e, the, deviatoric, stress, in, a, newtonian, fluid, has, no, normal, stress, components, and, it, has, a, compressibility, term, in, addition, to, the, incompressible, case, which, is, proportional, to, the, shear, viscosity, u, u, t, 2, 3, u, i, displaystyle, boldsymbol, sigma, boldsymbol, tau, mu, left, both, bulk, viscosity, textstyle, zeta, and, dynamic, viscosity, textstyle, mu, need, not, be, constant, in, general, they, depend, on, two, thermodynamics, variables, if, the, fluid, contains, a, single, chemical, species, say, for, example, pressure, and, temperature, any, equation, that, makes, explicit, one, of, these, transport, coefficient, in, the, conservation, variables, is, called, an, equation, of, state, the, most, general, of, the, navier, stokes, equations, become, d, u, d, t, u, t, u, u, p, u, u, t, 2, 3, u, i, u, f, displaystyle, rho, frac, mathrm, d, mathbf, u, mathrm, d, t, rho, left, frac, partial, mathbf, u, partial, t, mathbf, u, cdot, nabla, mathbf, u, right, nabla, p, nabla, cdot, left, mu, left, right, nabla, rho, mathbf, f, in, index, notation, the, equation, can, be, written, as, u, i, t, u, k, u, i, x, k, p, x, i, x, k, u, i, x, k, u, k, x, i, 2, 3, i, k, u, l, x, l, x, i, u, l, x, l, f, i, displaystyle, rho, left, frac, partial, u, i, partial, t, u, k, frac, partial, u, i, partial,

equation, in, conservation, form, can, be, obtained, by, considering, that, given, the, mass, continuity, equation, the, left, side, is, equivalent, to, d, u, d, t, t, u, u, u, displaystyle, rho, frac, mathrm, d, mathbf, u, mathrm, d, t, frac, partial, partial, t, rho, mathbf, u, nabla, cdot, rho, mathbf, u, otimes, mathbf, u, to, give, finally, t, u, u, u, p, u, i, u, u, t, 2, 3, u, i, f, displaystyle, frac, partial, partial, t, rho, mathbf, u, nabla, cdot, left, rho, mathbf, u, otimes, mathbf, u, mathbf, i, mu, left, right, rho, mathbf, f, apart, from, its, dependence, of, pressure, and, temperature, the, second, viscosity, coefficient, also, depends, on, the, process, that, is, to, say, the, second, viscosity, coefficient, is, not, just, a, material, property, example, in, the, case, of, a, sound, wave, with, a, definitive, frequency, that, alternatively, compresses, and, expands, a, fluid, element, the, second, viscosity, coefficient, depends, on, the, frequency, of, the, wave, this, dependence, is, called, the, dispersion, in, some, cases, the, second, viscosity, textstyle, zeta, can, be, assumed, to, be, constant, in, which, case, the, effect, of, the, volume, viscosity, textstyle, zeta, is, that, the, mechanical, pressure, is, not, equivalent, to, the, thermodynamic, pressure, as, demonstrated, below, u, i, u, displaystyle, nabla, cdot, nabla, cdot, mathbf, u, mathbf, i, nabla, nabla, cdot, mathbf, u, p, p, u, displaystyle, bar, p, equiv, p, zeta, nabla, cdot, mathbf, u, however, this, difference, is, usually, neglected, most, of, the, time, that, is, whenever, we, are, not, dealing, with, processes, such, as, sound, absorption, and, attenuation, of, shock, waves, where, second, viscosity, coefficient, becomes, important, by, explicitly, assuming, 0, textstyle, zeta, 0, the, assumption, of, setting, 0, textstyle, zeta, 0, is, called, as, the, stokes, hypothesis, the, validity, of, stokes, hypothesis, can, be, demonstrated, for, monoatomic, gas, both, experimentally, and, from, the, kinetic, theory, for, other, gases, and, liquids, stokes, hypothesis, is, generally, incorrect, with, the, stokes, hypothesis, the, navier, stokes, equations, become, d, u, d, t, u, t, u, u, p, u, u, t, 2, 3, u, i, f, displaystyle, rho, frac, mathrm, d, mathbf, u, mathrm, d, t, rho, left, frac, partial, mathbf, u, partial, t, mathbf, u, cdot, nabla, mathbf, u, right, nabla, p, nabla, cdot, left, mu, left, right, rho, mathbf, f, if, the, dynamic, and, bulk, displaystyle, zeta, viscosities, are, assumed, to, be, uniform, in, space, the, equations, in, convective, form, can, be, simplified, further, by, computing, the, divergence, of, the, stress, tensor, since, the, divergence, of, tensor, u, textstyle, nabla, mathbf, u, is, 2, u, textstyle, nabla, 2, mathbf, u, and, the, divergence, of, tensor, u, t, textstyle, left, nabla, mathbf, u, right, mathrm, t, is, u, textstyle, nabla, left, nabla, cdot, mathbf, u, right, one, finally, arrives, to, the, compressible, navier, stokes, momentum, equation, d, u, d, t, 1, p, 2, u, 1, 3, u, f, displaystyle, frac, d, mathbf, u, dt, frac, 1, rho, nabla, p, nu, nabla, 2, mathbf, u,

kinematic, viscosity, and, displaystyle, xi, frac, zeta, rho, is, the, bulk, kinematic, viscosity, the, left, hand, side, changes, in, the, conservation, form, of, the, navier, stokes, momentum, equation, by, bringing, the, operator, on, the, flow, velocity, on, the, left, side, on, also, has, t, u, 2, 1, 3, u, 1, p, f, displaystyle, left, frac, partial, partial, t, mathbf, u, cdot, nabla, nu, nabla, 2, tfrac, 1, 3, nu, xi, nabla, nabla, cdot, right, mathbf, u, frac, 1, rho, nabla, p, mathbf, f, the, convective, acceleration, term, can, also, be, written, as, u, u, u, u, 1, 2, u, 2, displaystyle, mathbf, u, cdot, nabla, mathbf, u, nabla, times, mathbf, u, times, mathbf, u, tfrac, 1, 2, nabla, mathbf, u, 2, where, the, vector, u, u, textstyle, nabla, times, mathbf, u, times, mathbf, u, is, known, as, the, lamb, vector, for, the, special, case, of, an, incompressible, flow, the, pressure, constrains, the, flow, so, that, the, volume, of, fluid, elements, is, constant, isochoric, flow, resulting, in, a, solenoidal, velocity, field, with, u, 0, textstyle, nabla, cdot, mathbf, u, 0, the, incompressible, momentum, navier, stokes, equation, results, from, the, following, assumptions, on, the, cauchy, stress, tensor, where, 1, 2, u, u, t, displaystyle, boldsymbol, varepsilon, tfrac, 1, 2, left, mathbf, nabla, u, mathbf, nabla, u, mathrm, t, right, is, the, rate, of, strain, tensor, so, this, decomposition, can, be, made, explicit, as, this, is, constitutive, equation, is, also, called, the, newtonian, law, of, viscosity, dynamic, viscosity, need, not, be, constant, in, incompressible, flows, it, can, depend, on, density, and, on, pressure, any, equation, that, makes, explicit, one, of, these, transport, coefficient, in, the, conservative, variables, is, called, an, equation, of, state, the, divergence, of, the, deviatoric, stress, in, case, of, uniform, viscosity, is, given, by, 2, u, u, t, 2, u, displaystyle, nabla, cdot, boldsymbol,

0, for, an, incompressible, fluid, incompressibility, rules, out, density, and, pressure, waves, like, sound, or, shock, waves, so, this, simplification, is, not, useful, if, these, phenomena, are, of, interest, the, incompressible, flow, assumption, typically, holds, well, with, all, fluids, at, low, mach, numbers, say, up, to, about, mach, 0, 3, such, as, for, modelling, air, winds, at, normal, temperatures, the, incompressible, navier, stokes, equations, are, best, visualized, by, dividing, for, the, density, d, u, d, t, u, t, u, u, 2, u, 1, p, f, displaystyle, frac, d, mathbf, u,

the, difference, between, the, velocity, at, a, point, and, the, mean, velocity, in, a, small, surrounding, volume, this, implies, that, for, a, newtonian, fluid, viscosity, operates, as, a,

axisymmetric, flow, another, stream, function, formulation, called, the, stokes, stream, function, can, be, used, to, describe, the, velocity, components, of, an, incompressible, flow, with, one, scalar, function, the, incompressible, navier, stokes, equation, is, a, differential, algebraic, equation, having, the, inconvenient, feature, that, there, is, no, explicit, mechanism, for, advancing, the, pressure, in, time, consequently, much, effort, has, been, expended, to, eliminate, the, pressure, from, all, or, part, of, the, computational, process, the, stream, function, formulation, eliminates, the, pressure, but, only, in, two, dimensions, and, at, the, expense, of, introducing, higher, derivatives, and, elimination, of, the, velocity, which, is, the, primary, variable, of, interest, the, navier, stokes, equations, are, nonlinear, partial, differential, equations, in, the, general, case, and, so, remain, in, almost, every, real, situation, in, some, cases, such, as, one, dimensional, flow, and, stokes, flow, or, creeping, flow, the, equations, can, be, simplified, to, linear, equations, the, nonlinearity, makes, most, problems, difficult, or, impossible, to, solve, and, is, the, main, contributor, to, the, turbulence, that, the, equations, model, the, nonlinearity, is, due, to, convective, acceleration, which, is, an, acceleration, associated, with, the, change, in, velocity, over, position, hence, any, convective, flow, whether, turbulent, or, not, will, involve, nonlinearity, an, example, of, convective, but, laminar, nonturbulent, flow, would, be, the, passage, of, a, viscous, fluid, for, example, oil, through, a, small, converging, nozzle, such, flows, whether, exactly, solvable, or, not, can, often, be, thoroughly, studied, and, understood, turbulence, is, the, time, dependent, chaotic, behaviour, seen, in, many, fluid, flows, it, is, generally, believed, that, it, is, due, to, the, inertia, of, the, fluid, as, a, whole, the, culmination, of, time, dependent, and, convective, acceleration, hence, flows, where, inertial, effects, are, small, tend, to, be, laminar, the, reynolds, number, quantifies, how, much, the, flow, is, affected, by, inertia, it, is, believed, though, not, known, with, certainty, that, the, navier, stokes, equations, describe, turbulence, properly, the, numerical, solution, of, the, navier, stokes, equations, for, turbulent, flow, is, extremely, difficult, and, due, to, the, significantly, different, mixing, length, scales, that, are, involved, in, turbulent, flow, the, stable, solution, of, this, requires, such, a, fine, mesh, resolution, that, the, computational, time, becomes, significantly, infeasible, for, calculation, or, direct, numerical, simulation, attempts, to, solve, turbulent, flow, using, a, laminar, solver, typically, result, in, a, time, unsteady, solution, which, fails, to, converge, appropriately, to, counter, this, time, averaged, equations, such, as, the, reynolds, averaged, navier, stokes, equations, rans, supplemented, with, turbulence, models, are, used, in, practical, computational, fluid, dynamics, cfd, applications, when, modeling, turbulent, flows, some, models, include, the, spalart, allmaras, k, k, and, sst, models, which, add, a, variety, of, additional, equations, to, bring, closure, to, the, rans, equations, large, eddy, simulation, les, can, also, be, used, to, solve, these, equations, numerically, this, approach, is, computationally, more, expensive, in, time, and, in, computer, memory, than, rans, but, produces, better, results, because, it, explicitly, resolves, the, larger, turbulent, scales, together, with, supplemental, equations, for, example, conservation, of, mass, and, well, formulated, boundary, conditions, the, navier, stokes, equations, seem, to, model, fluid, motion, accurately, even, turbulent, flows, seem, on, average, to, agree, with, real, world, observations, the, navier, stokes, equations, assume, that, the, fluid, being, studied, is, a, continuum, it, is, infinitely, divisible, and, not, composed, of, particles, such, as, atoms, or, molecules, and, is, not, moving, at, relativistic, velocities, at, very, small, scales, or, under, extreme, conditions, real, fluids, made, out, of, discrete, molecules, will, produce, results, different, from, the, continuous, fluids, modeled, by, the, navier, stokes, equations, for, example, capillarity, of, internal, layers, in, fluids, appears, for, flow, with, high, gradients, for, large, knudsen, number, of, the, problem, the, boltzmann, equation, may, be, a, suitable, replacement, failing, that, one, may, have, to, resort, to, molecular, dynamics, or, various, hybrid, methods, another, limitation, is, simply, the, complicated, nature, of, the, equations, time, tested, formulations, exist, for, common, fluid, families, but, the, application, of, the, navier, stokes, equations, to, less, common, families, tends, to, result, in, very, complicated, formulations, and, often, to, open, research, problems, for, this, reason, these, equations, are, usually, written, for, newtonian, fluids, where, the, viscosity, model, is, linear, truly, general, models, for, the, flow, of, other, kinds, of, fluids, such, as, blood, do, not, exist, the, navier, stokes, equations, even, when, written, explicitly, for, specific, fluids, are, rather, generic, in, nature, and, their, proper, application, to, specific, problems, can, be, very, diverse, this, is, partly, because, there, is, an, enormous, variety, of, problems, that, may, be, modeled, ranging, from, as, simple, as, the, distribution, of, static, pressure, to, as, complicated, as, multiphase, flow, driven, by, surface, tension, generally, application, to, specific, problems, begins, with, some, flow, assumptions, and, initial, boundary, condition, formulation, this, may, be, followed, by, scale, analysis, to, further, simplify, the, problem, assume, steady, parallel, one, dimensional, non, convective, pressure, driven, flow, between, parallel, plates, the, resulting, scaled, dimensionless, boundary, value, problem, is, d, 2, u, d, y, 2, 1, u, 0, u, 1, 0, displaystyle, frac, mathrm, d, 2, u, mathrm, d, y, 2, 1, quad, u, 0, u, 1, 0, the, boundary, condition, is, the, no, slip, condition, this, problem, is, easily, solved, for, the, flow, field, u, y, y, y, 2, 2, displaystyle, u, y, frac, y, y, 2, 2, from, this, point, onward, more, quantities, of, interest, can, be, easily, obtained, such, as, viscous, drag, force, or, net, flow, rate, difficulties, may, arise, when, the, problem, becomes, slightly, more, complicated, a, seemingly, modest, twist, on, the, parallel, flow, above, would, be, the, radial, flow, between, parallel, plates, this, involves, convection, and, thus, non, linearity, the, velocity, field, may, be, represented, by, a, function, f, z, that, must, satisfy, d, 2, f, d, z, 2, r, f, 2, 1, f, 1, f, 1, 0, displaystyle, frac, mathrm, d, 2, f, mathrm, d, z, 2, rf, 2, 1, quad, f, 1, f, 1, 0, this, ordinary, differential, equation, is, what, is, obtained, when, the, navier, stokes, equations, are, written, and, the, flow, assumptions, applied, additionally, the, pressure, gradient, is, solved, for, the, nonlinear, term, makes, this, a, very, difficult, problem, to, solve, analytically, a, lengthy, implicit, solution, may, be, found, which, involves, elliptic, integrals, and, roots, of, cubic, polynomials, issues, with, the, actual, existence, of, solutions, arise, for, r, 1, 41, textstyle, r, 1, 41, approximately, this, is, not, 2, the, parameter, r, textstyle, r, being, the, reynolds, number, with, appropriately, chosen, scales, this, is, an, example, of, flow, assumptions, losing, their, applicability, and, an, example, of, the, difficulty, in, high, reynolds, number, flows, a, type, of, natural, convection, that, can, be, described, by, the, navier, stokes, equation, is, the, rayleigh, b, nard, convection, it, is, one, of, the, most, commonly, studied, convection, phenomena, because, of, its, analytical, and, experimental, accessibility, some, exact, solutions, to, the, navier, stokes, equations, exist, examples, of, degenerate, cases, with, the, non, linear, terms, in, the, navier, stokes, equations, equal, to, zero, are, poiseuille, flow, couette, flow, and, the, oscillatory, stokes, boundary, layer, but, also, more, interesting, examples, solutions, to, the, full, non, linear, equations, exist, such, as, jeffery, hamel, flow, von, k, rm, n, swirling, flow, stagnation, point, flow, landau, squire, jet, and, taylor, green, vortex, note, that, the, existence, of, these, exact, solutions, does, not, imply, they, are, stable, turbulence, may, develop, at,
