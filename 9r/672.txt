the, cambrian, explosion, also, known, as, cambrian, radiation, or, cambrian, diversification, is, an, interval, of, time, approximately, 538, 8, million, years, ago, in, the, cambrian, period, of, the, early, paleozoic, when, a, sudden, radiation, of, complex, life, occurred, and, practically, all, major, animal, phyla, started, appearing, in, the, fossil, record, it, lasted, for, about, 13, to, 25, million, years, and, resulted, in, the, divergence, of, most, modern, metazoan, phyla, the, event, was, accompanied, by, major, diversification, in, other, groups, of, organisms, as, well, before, early, cambrian, diversification, most, organisms, were, relatively, simple, composed, of, individual, cells, or, small, multicellular, organisms, occasionally, organized, into, colonies, as, the, rate, of, diversification, subsequently, accelerated, the, variety, of, life, became, much, more, complex, and, began, to, resemble, that, of, today, almost, all, present, day, animal, phyla, appeared, during, this, period, including, the, earliest, chordates, the, seemingly, rapid, appearance, of, fossils, in, the, primordial, strata, was, noted, by, william, buckland, in, the, 1840s, and, in, his, 1859, book, on, the, origin, of, species, charles, darwin, discussed, the, then, inexplicable, lack, of, earlier, fossils, as, one, of, the, main, difficulties, for, his, theory, of, descent, with, slow, modification, through, natural, selection, the, long, running, puzzlement, about, the, seemingly, sudden, appearance, of, the, cambrian, fauna, without, evident, precursor, s, centers, on, three, key, points, whether, there, really, was, a, mass, diversification, of, complex, organisms, over, a, relatively, short, period, during, the, early, cambrian, what, might, have, caused, such, rapid, change, and, what, it, would, imply, about, the, origin, of, animal, life, interpretation, is, difficult, owing, to, a, limited, supply, of, evidence, based, mainly, on, an, incomplete, fossil, record, and, chemical, signatures, remaining, in, cambrian, rocks, the, first, discovered, cambrian, fossils, were, trilobites, described, by, edward, lhuyd, the, curator, of, oxford, museum, in, 1698, although, their, evolutionary, importance, was, not, known, on, the, basis, of, their, old, age, william, buckland, 1784, 1856, realized, that, a, dramatic, step, change, in, the, fossil, record, had, occurred, around, the, base, of, what, we, now, call, the, cambrian, nineteenth, century, geologists, such, as, adam, sedgwick, and, roderick, murchison, used, the, fossils, for, dating, rock, strata, specifically, for, establishing, the, cambrian, and, silurian, periods, by, 1859, leading, geologists, including, roderick, murchison, were, convinced, that, what, was, then, called, the, lowest, silurian, stratum, showed, the, origin, of, life, on, earth, though, others, including, charles, lyell, differed, in, on, the, origin, of, species, darwin, considered, this, sudden, appearance, of, a, solitary, group, of, trilobites, with, no, apparent, antecedents, and, absent, other, fossils, to, be, undoubtedly, of, the, gravest, nature, among, the, difficulties, in, his, theory, of, natural, selection, he, reasoned, that, earlier, seas, had, swarmed, with, living, creatures, but, that, their, fossils, had, not, been, found, because, of, the, imperfections, of, the, fossil, record, in, the, sixth, edition, of, his, book, he, stressed, his, problem, further, as, to, the, question, why, we, do, not, find, rich, fossiliferous, deposits, belonging, to, these, assumed, earliest, periods, prior, to, the, cambrian, system, i, can, give, no, satisfactory, answer, american, paleontologist, charles, walcott, who, studied, the, burgess, shale, fauna, proposed, that, an, interval, of, time, the, lipalian, was, not, represented, in, the, fossil, record, or, did, not, preserve, fossils, and, that, the, ancestors, of, the, cambrian, animals, evolved, during, this, time, earlier, fossil, evidence, has, since, been, found, the, earliest, claim, is, that, the, history, of, life, on, earth, goes, back, 3, 850, million, years, rocks, of, that, age, at, warrawoona, australia, were, claimed, to, contain, fossil, stromatolites, stubby, pillars, formed, by, colonies, of, microorganisms, fossils, grypania, of, more, complex, eukaryotic, cells, from, which, all, animals, plants, and, fungi, are, built, have, been, found, in, rocks, from, 1, 400, million, years, ago, in, china, and, montana, rocks, dating, from, 580, to, 543, million, years, ago, contain, fossils, of, the, ediacara, biota, organisms, so, large, that, they, are, likely, multicelled, but, very, unlike, any, modern, organism, in, 1948, preston, cloud, argued, that, a, period, of, eruptive, evolution, occurred, in, the, early, cambrian, but, as, recently, as, the, 1970s, no, sign, was, seen, of, how, the, relatively, modern, looking, organisms, of, the, middle, and, late, cambrian, arose, the, intense, modern, interest, in, this, cambrian, explosion, was, sparked, by, the, work, of, harry, b, whittington, and, colleagues, who, in, the, 1970s, reanalysed, many, fossils, from, the, burgess, shale, and, concluded, that, several, were, as, complex, as, but, different, from, any, living, animals, the, most, common, organism, marrella, was, clearly, an, arthropod, but, not, a, member, of, any, known, arthropod, class, organisms, such, as, the, five, eyed, opabinia, and, spiny, slug, like, wiwaxia, were, so, different, from, anything, else, known, that, whittington, s, team, assumed, they, must, represent, different, phyla, seemingly, unrelated, to, anything, known, today, stephen, jay, gould, s, popular, 1989, account, of, this, work, wonderful, life, brought, the, matter, into, the, public, eye, and, raised, questions, about, what, the, explosion, represented, while, differing, significantly, in, details, both, whittington, and, gould, proposed, that, all, modern, animal, phyla, had, appeared, almost, simultaneously, in, a, rather, short, span, of, geological, period, this, view, led, to, the, modernization, of, darwin, s, tree, of, life, and, the, theory, of, punctuated, equilibrium, which, eldredge, and, gould, developed, in, the, early, 1970s, and, which, views, evolution, as, long, intervals, of, near, stasis, punctuated, by, short, periods, of, rapid, change, other, analyses, some, more, recent, and, some, dating, back, to, the, 1970s, argue, that, complex, animals, similar, to, modern, types, evolved, well, before, the, start, of, the, cambrian, radiometric, dates, for, much, of, the, cambrian, obtained, by, analysis, of, radioactive, elements, contained, within, rocks, have, only, recently, become, available, and, for, only, a, few, regions, relative, dating, a, was, before, b, is, often, assumed, sufficient, for, studying, processes, of, evolution, but, this, too, has, been, difficult, because, of, the, problems, involved, in, matching, up, rocks, of, the, same, age, across, different, continents, therefore, dates, or, descriptions, of, sequences, of, events, should, be, regarded, with, some, caution, until, better, data, become, available, in, 2004, the, start, of, the, cambrian, was, dated, to, 542, ma, in, 2012, it, was, revised, to, 541, ma, then, in, 2022, it, was, changed, again, to, 538, 8, ma, some, theory, suggest, cambrian, explosion, occurred, during, the, last, stages, of, gondwanan, assembly, which, is, formed, following, rodinia, splitting, overlapped, with, the, opening, of, the, iapetus, ocean, between, laurentia, and, western, gondwana, the, largest, cambrian, faunal, province, is, located, around, gondwana, which, extended, from, the, low, northern, latitudes, to, the, high, southern, latitudes, just, short, of, the, south, pole, by, the, middle, and, later, parts, of, the, cambrian, continued, rifting, had, sent, the, paleocontinents, of, laurentia, baltica, and, siberia, on, their, separate, ways, fossils, of, organisms, bodies, are, usually, the, most, informative, type, of, evidence, fossilization, is, a, rare, event, and, most, fossils, are, destroyed, by, erosion, or, metamorphism, before, they, can, be, observed, hence, the, fossil, record, is, very, incomplete, increasingly, so, as, earlier, times, are, considered, despite, this, they, are, often, adequate, to, illustrate, the, broader, patterns, of, life, s, history, also, biases, exist, in, the, fossil, record, different, environments, are, more, favourable, to, the, preservation, of, different, types, of, organism, or, parts, of, organisms, further, only, the, parts, of, organisms, that, were, already, mineralised, are, usually, preserved, such, as, the, shells, of, molluscs, since, most, animal, species, are, soft, bodied, they, decay, before, they, can, become, fossilised, as, a, result, although, 30, plus, phyla, of, living, animals, are, known, two, thirds, have, never, been, found, as, fossils, the, cambrian, fossil, record, includes, an, unusually, high, number, of, lagerst, tten, which, preserve, soft, tissues, these, allow, paleontologists, to, examine, the, internal, anatomy, of, animals, which, in, other, sediments, are, only, represented, by, shells, spines, claws, etc, if, they, are, preserved, at, all, the, most, significant, cambrian, lagerst, tten, are, the, early, cambrian, maotianshan, shale, beds, of, chengjiang, yunnan, china, and, sirius, passet, greenland, the, middle, cambrian, burgess, shale, british, columbia, canada, and, the, late, cambrian, orsten, sweden, fossil, beds, while, lagerst, tten, preserve, far, more, than, the, conventional, fossil, record, they, are, far, from, complete, because, lagerst, tten, are, restricted, to, a, narrow, range, of, environments, where, soft, bodied, organisms, can, be, preserved, very, quickly, e, g, by, mudslides, most, animals, are, probably, not, represented, further, the, exceptional, conditions, that, create, lagerst, tten, probably, do, not, represent, normal, living, conditions, in, addition, the, known, cambrian, lagerst, tten, are, rare, and, difficult, to, date, while, precambrian, lagerst, tten, have, yet, to, be, studied, in, detail, the, sparseness, of, the, fossil, record, means, that, organisms, usually, exist, long, before, they, are, found, in, the, fossil, record, this, is, known, as, the, signor, lipps, effect, in, 2019, a, stunning, find, of, lagerst, tten, known, as, the, qingjiang, biota, was, reported, from, the, danshui, river, in, hubei, province, china, more, than, 20, 000, fossil, specimens, were, collected, including, many, soft, bodied, animals, such, as, jellyfish, sea, anemones, and, worms, as, well, as, sponges, arthropods, and, algae, in, some, specimens, the, internal, body, structures, were, sufficiently, preserved, that, soft, tissues, including, muscles, gills, mouths, guts, and, eyes, can, be, seen, the, remains, were, dated, to, around, 518, mya, and, around, half, of, the, species, identified, at, the, time, of, reporting, were, previously, unknown, trace, fossils, consist, mainly, of, tracks, and, burrows, but, also, include, coprolites, fossil, feces, and, marks, left, by, feeding, trace, fossils, are, particularly, significant, because, they, represent, a, data, source, that, is, not, limited, to, animals, with, easily, fossilized, hard, parts, and, reflects, organisms, behaviour, also, many, traces, date, from, significantly, earlier, than, the, body, fossils, of, animals, that, are, thought, to, have, been, capable, of, making, them, while, exact, assignment, of, trace, fossils, to, their, makers, is, generally, impossible, traces, may, for, example, provide, the, earliest, physical, evidence, of, the, appearance, of, moderately, complex, animals, comparable, to, earthworms, several, chemical, markers, indicate, a, drastic, change, in, the, environment, around, the, start, of, the, cambrian, the, markers, are, consistent, with, a, mass, extinction, or, with, a, massive, warming, resulting, from, the, release, of, methane, ice, such, changes, may, reflect, a, cause, of, the, cambrian, explosion, although, they, may, also, have, resulted, from, an, increased, level, of, biological, activity, a, possible, result, of, the, explosion, despite, these, uncertainties, the, geochemical, evidence, helps, by, making, scientists, focus, on, theories, that, are, consistent, with, at, least, one, of, the, likely, environmental, changes, cladistics, is, a, technique, for, working, out, the, family, tree, of, a, set, of, organisms, it, works, by, the, logic, that, if, groups, b, and, c, have, more, similarities, to, each, other, than, either, has, to, group, a, then, b, and, c, are, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, either, is, to, a, characteristics, that, are, compared, may, be, anatomical, such, as, the, presence, of, a, notochord, or, molecular, by, comparing, sequences, of, dna, or, protein, the, result, of, a, successful, analysis, is, a, hierarchy, of, clades, groups, whose, members, are, believed, to, share, a, common, ancestor, the, cladistic, technique, is, sometimes, problematic, as, some, features, such, as, wings, or, camera, eyes, evolved, more, than, once, convergently, this, must, be, taken, into, account, in, analyses, from, the, relationships, it, may, be, possible, to, constrain, the, date, that, lineages, first, appeared, for, instance, if, fossils, of, b, or, c, date, to, x, million, years, ago, and, the, calculated, family, tree, says, a, was, an, ancestor, of, b, and, c, then, a, must, have, evolved, more, than, x, million, years, ago, it, is, also, possible, to, estimate, how, long, ago, two, living, clades, diverged, i, e, about, how, long, ago, their, last, common, ancestor, must, have, lived, by, assuming, that, dna, mutations, accumulate, at, a, constant, rate, these, molecular, clocks, however, are, fallible, and, provide, only, a, very, approximate, timing, they, are, not, sufficiently, precise, and, reliable, for, estimating, when, the, groups, that, feature, in, the, cambrian, explosion, first, evolved, and, estimates, produced, by, different, techniques, vary, by, a, factor, of, two, however, the, clocks, can, give, an, indication, of, branching, rate, and, when, combined, with, the, constraints, of, the, fossil, record, recent, clocks, suggest, a, sustained, period, of, diversification, through, the, ediacaran, and, cambrian, a, phylum, is, the, highest, level, in, the, linnaean, system, for, classifying, organisms, phyla, can, be, thought, of, as, groupings, of, animals, based, on, general, body, plan, despite, the, seemingly, different, external, appearances, of, organisms, they, are, classified, into, phyla, based, on, their, internal, and, developmental, organizations, for, example, despite, their, obvious, differences, spiders, and, barnacles, both, belong, to, the, phylum, arthropoda, but, earthworms, and, tapeworms, although, similar, in, shape, belong, to, different, phyla, as, chemical, and, genetic, testing, becomes, more, accurate, previously, hypothesised, phyla, are, often, entirely, reworked, a, phylum, is, not, a, fundamental, division, of, nature, such, as, the, difference, between, electrons, and, protons, it, is, simply, a, very, high, level, grouping, in, a, classification, system, created, to, describe, all, currently, living, organisms, this, system, is, imperfect, even, for, modern, animals, different, books, quote, different, numbers, of, phyla, mainly, because, they, disagree, about, the, classification, of, a, huge, number, of, worm, like, species, as, it, is, based, on, living, organisms, it, accommodates, extinct, organisms, poorly, if, at, all, the, concept, of, stem, groups, was, introduced, to, cover, evolutionary, aunts, and, cousins, of, living, groups, and, have, been, hypothesized, based, on, this, scientific, theory, a, crown, group, is, a, group, of, closely, related, living, animals, plus, their, last, common, ancestor, plus, all, its, descendants, a, stem, group, is, a, set, of, offshoots, from, the, lineage, at, a, point, earlier, than, the, last, common, ancestor, of, the, crown, group, it, is, a, relative, concept, for, example, tardigrades, are, living, animals, that, form, a, crown, group, in, their, own, right, but, budd, 1996, regarded, them, as, also, being, a, stem, group, relative, to, the, arthropods, the, term, triploblastic, means, consisting, of, three, layers, which, are, formed, in, the, embryo, quite, early, in, the, animal, s, development, from, a, single, celled, egg, to, a, larva, or, juvenile, form, the, innermost, layer, forms, the, digestive, tract, gut, the, outermost, forms, skin, and, the, middle, one, forms, muscles, and, all, the, internal, organs, except, the, digestive, system, most, types, of, living, animal, are, triploblastic, the, best, known, exceptions, are, porifera, sponges, and, cnidaria, jellyfish, sea, anemones, etc, the, bilaterians, are, animals, that, have, right, and, left, sides, at, some, point, in, their, life, histories, this, implies, that, they, have, top, and, bottom, surfaces, and, importantly, distinct, front, and, back, ends, all, known, bilaterian, animals, are, triploblastic, and, all, known, triploblastic, animals, are, bilaterian, living, echinoderms, sea, stars, sea, urchins, sea, cucumbers, etc, look, radially, symmetrical, like, wheels, rather, than, bilaterian, but, their, larvae, exhibit, bilateral, symmetry, and, some, of, the, earliest, echinoderms, may, have, been, bilaterally, symmetrical, porifera, and, cnidaria, are, radially, symmetrical, not, bilaterian, and, not, triploblastic, but, the, common, bilateria, cnidaria, ancestor, s, planula, larva, is, suspected, to, be, bilaterally, symmetric, the, term, coelomate, means, having, a, body, cavity, coelom, containing, the, internal, organs, most, of, the, phyla, featured, in, the, debate, about, the, cambrian, explosion, are, coelomates, arthropods, annelid, worms, molluscs, echinoderms, and, chordates, the, noncoelomate, priapulids, are, an, important, exception, all, known, coelomate, animals, are, triploblastic, bilaterians, but, some, triploblastic, bilaterian, animals, do, not, have, a, coelom, for, example, flatworms, whose, organs, are, surrounded, by, unspecialized, tissues, changes, in, the, abundance, and, diversity, of, some, types, of, fossil, have, been, interpreted, as, evidence, for, attacks, by, animals, or, other, organisms, stromatolites, stubby, pillars, built, by, colonies, of, microorganisms, are, a, major, constituent, of, the, fossil, record, from, about, 2, 700, million, years, ago, but, their, abundance, and, diversity, declined, steeply, after, about, 1, 250, million, years, ago, this, decline, has, been, attributed, to, disruption, by, grazing, and, burrowing, animals, precambrian, marine, diversity, was, dominated, by, small, fossils, known, as, acritarchs, this, term, describes, almost, any, small, organic, walled, fossil, from, the, egg, cases, of, small, metazoans, to, resting, cysts, of, many, different, kinds, of, green, algae, after, appearing, around, 2, 000, million, years, ago, acritarchs, underwent, a, boom, around, 1, 000, million, years, ago, increasing, in, abundance, diversity, size, complexity, of, shape, and, especially, size, and, number, of, spines, their, increasingly, spiny, forms, in, the, last, 1, billion, years, may, indicate, an, increased, need, for, defence, against, predation, other, groups, of, small, organisms, from, the, neoproterozoic, era, also, show, signs, of, antipredator, defenses, a, consideration, of, taxon, longevity, appears, to, support, an, increase, in, predation, pressure, around, this, time, in, general, the, fossil, record, shows, a, very, slow, appearance, of, these, lifeforms, in, the, precambrian, with, many, cyanobacterial, species, making, up, much, of, the, underlying, sediment, at, the, start, of, the, ediacaran, period, much, of, the, acritarch, fauna, which, had, remained, relatively, unchanged, for, hundreds, of, millions, of, years, became, extinct, to, be, replaced, with, a, range, of, new, larger, species, which, would, prove, far, more, ephemeral, this, radiation, the, first, in, the, fossil, record, is, followed, soon, after, by, an, array, of, unfamiliar, large, fossils, dubbed, the, ediacara, biota, which, flourished, for, 40, million, years, until, the, start, of, the, cambrian, most, of, this, ediacara, biota, were, at, least, a, few, centimeters, long, significantly, larger, than, any, earlier, fossils, the, organisms, form, three, distinct, assemblages, increasing, in, size, and, complexity, as, time, progressed, many, of, these, organisms, were, quite, unlike, anything, that, appeared, before, or, since, resembling, discs, mud, filled, bags, or, quilted, mattresses, one, paleontologist, proposed, that, the, strangest, organisms, should, be, classified, as, a, separate, kingdom, vendozoa, at, least, some, may, have, been, early, forms, of, the, phyla, at, the, heart, of, the, cambrian, explosion, debate, having, been, interpreted, as, early, molluscs, kimberella, echinoderms, arkarua, and, arthropods, spriggina, parvancorina, yilingia, still, debate, exists, about, the, classification, of, these, specimens, mainly, because, the, diagnostic, features, that, allow, taxonomists, to, classify, more, recent, organisms, such, as, similarities, to, living, organisms, are, generally, absent, in, the, ediacarans, however, there, seems, little, doubt, that, kimberella, was, at, least, a, triploblastic, bilaterian, animal, these, organisms, are, central, to, the, debate, about, how, abrupt, the, cambrian, explosion, was, if, some, were, early, members, of, the, animal, phyla, seen, today, the, explosion, looks, a, lot, less, sudden, than, if, all, these, organisms, represent, an, unrelated, experiment, and, were, replaced, by, the, animal, kingdom, fairly, soon, thereafter, 40m, years, is, soon, by, evolutionary, and, geological, standards, the, traces, of, organisms, moving, on, and, directly, underneath, the, microbial, mats, that, covered, the, ediacaran, sea, floor, are, preserved, from, the, ediacaran, period, about, 565, million, years, ago, they, were, probably, made, by, organisms, resembling, earthworms, in, shape, size, and, how, they, moved, the, burrow, makers, have, never, been, found, preserved, but, because, they, would, need, a, head, and, a, tail, the, burrowers, probably, had, bilateral, symmetry, which, would, in, all, probability, make, them, bilaterian, animals, they, fed, above, the, sediment, surface, but, were, forced, to, burrow, to, avoid, predators, trace, fossils, burrows, etc, are, a, reliable, indicator, of, what, life, was, around, and, indicate, a, diversification, of, life, around, the, start, of, the, cambrian, with, the, freshwater, realm, colonized, by, animals, almost, as, quickly, as, the, oceans, fossils, known, as, small, shelly, fauna, have, been, found, in, many, parts, on, the, world, and, date, from, just, before, the, cambrian, to, about, 10, million, years, after, the, start, of, the, cambrian, the, nemakit, daldynian, and, tommotian, ages, see, timeline, these, are, a, very, mixed, collection, of, fossils, spines, sclerites, armor, plates, tubes, archeocyathids, sponge, like, animals, and, small, shells, very, like, those, of, brachiopods, and, snail, like, molluscs, but, all, tiny, mostly, 1, to, 2, mm, long, while, small, these, fossils, are, far, more, common, than, complete, fossils, of, the, organisms, that, produced, them, crucially, they, cover, the, window, from, the, start, of, the, cambrian, to, the, first, lagerst, tten, a, period, of, time, otherwise, lacking, in, fossils, hence, they, supplement, the, conventional, fossil, record, and, allow, the, fossil, ranges, of, many, groups, to, be, extended, the, first, cnidarian, larvae, represented, by, the, genus, eolarva, appeared, in, the, cambrian, although, the, identity, of, eolarva, as, such, is, controversial, if, it, does, represent, a, cnidarian, larva, eolarva, would, represent, the, first, fossil, evidence, of, indirect, development, in, metazoans, in, the, earliest, cambrian, medusozoans, developed, complex, life, cycles, with, a, medusa, stage, during, the, cambrian, explosion, as, evidenced, by, the, discovery, of, burgessomedusa, phasmiformis, the, earliest, trilobite, fossils, are, about, 530, million, years, old, but, the, class, was, already, quite, diverse, and, cosmopolitan, suggesting, they, had, been, around, for, quite, some, time, the, fossil, record, of, trilobites, began, with, the, appearance, of, trilobites, with, mineral, exoskeletons, not, from, the, time, of, their, origin, crustaceans, one, of, the, four, great, modern, groups, of, arthropods, are, very, rare, throughout, the, cambrian, convincing, crustaceans, were, once, thought, to, be, common, in, burgess, shale, type, biotas, but, none, of, these, individuals, can, be, shown, to, fall, into, the, crown, group, of, true, crustaceans, the, cambrian, record, of, crown, group, crustaceans, comes, from, microfossils, the, swedish, orsten, horizons, contain, later, cambrian, crustaceans, but, only, organisms, smaller, than, 2, mm, are, preserved, this, restricts, the, data, set, to, juveniles, and, miniaturised, adults, a, more, informative, data, source, is, the, organic, microfossils, of, the, mount, cap, formation, mackenzie, mountains, canada, this, late, early, cambrian, assemblage, 510, to, 515, million, years, ago, consists, of, microscopic, fragments, of, arthropods, cuticle, which, is, left, behind, when, the, rock, is, dissolved, with, hydrofluoric, acid, the, diversity, of, this, assemblage, is, similar, to, that, of, modern, crustacean, faunas, analysis, of, fragments, of, feeding, machinery, found, in, the, formation, shows, that, it, was, adapted, to, feed, in, a, very, precise, and, refined, fashion, this, contrasts, with, most, other, early, cambrian, arthropods, which, fed, messily, by, shovelling, anything, they, could, get, their, feeding, appendages, on, into, their, mouths, this, sophisticated, and, specialised, feeding, machinery, belonged, to, a, large, about, 30, cm, organism, and, would, have, provided, great, potential, for, diversification,

earliest, generally, accepted, echinoderm, fossils, appeared, in, the, late, atdabanian, unlike, modern, echinoderms, these, early, cambrian, echinoderms, were, not, all, radially, symmetrical, these, provide, firm, data, points, for, the, end, of, the, explosion, or, at, least, indications, that, the, crown, groups, of, modern, phyla, were, represented, around, the, start, of, the, cambrian, about, 539, million, years, ago, many, new, types, of, traces, first, appear, including, well, known, vertical, burrows, such, as, diplocraterion, and, skolithos, and, traces, normally, attributed, to, arthropods, such, as, cruziana, and, rusophycus, the, vertical, burrows, indicate, that, worm, like, animals, acquired, new, behaviours, and, possibly, new, physical, capabilities, some, cambrian, trace, fossils, indicate, that, their, makers, possessed, hard, exoskeletons, although, they, were, not, necessarily, mineralised, meiofaunal, as, well, as, macrofaunal, bilaterians, participated, in, this, invasion, of, infaunal, niches, burrows, provide, firm, evidence, of, complex, organisms, they, are, also, much, more, readily, preserved, than, body, fossils, to, the, extent, that, the, absence, of, trace, fossils, has, been, used, to, imply, the, genuine, absence, of, large, motile, bottom, dwelling, organisms, they, provide, a, further, line, of, evidence, to, show, that, the, cambrian, explosion, represents, a, real, diversification, and, is, not, a, preservational, artifact, the, first, ediacaran, and, lowest, cambrian, nemakit, daldynian, skeletal, fossils, represent, tubes, and, problematic, sponge, spicules, the, oldest, sponge, spicules, are, monaxon, siliceous, aged, around, 580, million, years, ago, known, from, the, doushantou, formation, in, china, and, from, deposits, of, the, same, age, in, mongolia, although, the, interpretation, of, these, fossils, as, spicules, has, been, challenged, in, the, late, ediacaran, lowest, cambrian, numerous, tube, dwellings, of, enigmatic, organisms, appeared, it, was, organic, walled, tubes, e, g, saarina, and, chitinous, tubes, of, the, sabelliditids, e, g, sokoloviina, sabellidites, paleolina, that, prospered, up, to, the, beginning, of, the, tommotian, the, mineralized, tubes, of, cloudina, namacalathus, sinotubulites, and, a, dozen, more, of, the, other, organisms, from, carbonate, rocks, formed, near, the, end, of, the, ediacaran, period, from, 549, to, 542, million, years, ago, as, well, as, the, triradially, symmetrical, mineralized, tubes, of, anabaritids, e, g, anabarites,

live, in, an, environment, adverse, to, the, majority, of, animals, although, they, are, as, hard, to, classify, as, most, other, ediacaran, organisms, they, are, important, in, two, other, ways, first, they, are, the, earliest, known, calcifying, organisms, organisms, that, built, shells, from, calcium, carbonate, secondly, these, tubes, are, a, device, to, rise, over, a, substrate, and, competitors, for, effective, feeding, and, to, a, lesser, degree, they, serve, as, armor, for, protection, against, predators, and, adverse, conditions, of, environment, some, cloudina, fossils, show, small, holes, in, shells, the, holes, possibly, are, evidence, of, boring, by, predators, sufficiently, advanced, to, penetrate, shells, a, possible, evolutionary, arms, race, between, predators, and, prey, is, one, of, the, hypotheses, that, attempt, to, explain, the, cambrian, explosion, in, the, lowest, cambrian, the, stromatolites, were, decimated, this, allowed, animals, to, begin,

skeletons, as, shells, sclerites, thorns, and, plates, appeared, in, uppermost, nemakit, daldynian, they, were, the, earliest, species, of, halkierids, gastropods, hyoliths, and, other, rare, organisms, the, beginning, of, the, tommotian, has, historically, been, understood, to, mark, an, explosive, increase, of, the, number, and, variety, of, fossils, of, molluscs, hyoliths, and, sponges, along, with, a, rich, complex, of, skeletal, elements, of, unknown, animals, the, first, archaeocyathids, brachiopods, tommotiids, and, others, also, soft, bodied, extant, phyla, such, as, comb, jellies, scalidophorans, entoproctans, horseshoe, worms, and, lobopodians, had, armored, forms, this, sudden, increase, is, partially, an, artefact, of, missing, strata, at, the, tommotian, type, section, and, most, of, this, fauna, in, fact, began, to, diversify, in, a, series, of, pulses, through, the, nemakit, daldynian, and, into, the, tommotian, some, animals, may, already, have, had, sclerites, thorns, and, plates, in, the, ediacaran, e, g, kimberella, had, hard, sclerites, probably, of, carbonate, but, thin, carbonate, skeletons, cannot, be, fossilized, in, siliciclastic,

burgess, shale, and, similar, lagerst, tten, preserve, the, soft, parts, of, organisms, which, provide, a, wealth, of, data, to, aid, in, the, classification, of, enigmatic, fossils, it, often, preserved, complete, specimens, of, organisms, only, otherwise, known, from, dispersed, parts, such, as, loose, scales, or, isolated, mouthparts, further, the, majority, of, organisms, and, taxa, in, these, horizons, are, entirely, soft, bodied, hence, absent, from, the, rest, of, the, fossil, record, since, a, large, part, of, the, ecosystem, is, preserved, the, ecology, of, the, community, can, also, be, tentatively, reconstructed, however, the, assemblages, may, represent, a, museum, a, deep, water, ecosystem, that, is, evolutionarily, behind, the, rapidly, diversifying, fauna, of, shallower, waters, because, the, lagerst, tten, provide, a, mode, and, quality, of, preservation, that, is, virtually, absent, outside, of, the, cambrian, many, organisms, appear, completely, different, from, anything, known, from, the, conventional, fossil, record, this, led, early, workers, in, the, field, to, attempt, to, shoehorn, the, organisms, into, extant, phyla, the, shortcomings, of, this, approach, led, later, workers, to, erect, a, multitude, of, new, phyla, to, accommodate, all, the, oddballs, it, has, since, been, realised, that, most, oddballs, diverged, from, lineages, before, they, established, the, phyla, known, today, slightly, different, designs, which, were, fated, to, perish, rather, than, flourish, into, phyla, as, their, cousin, lineages, did, the, preservational, mode, is, rare, in, the, preceding, ediacaran, period, but, those, assemblages, known, show, no, trace, of, animal, life, perhaps, implying, a, genuine, absence, of, macroscopic, metazoans, the, early, cambrian, interval, of, diversification, lasted, for, about, the, next, 20, 25, million, years, and, its, elevated, rates, of, evolution, had, ended, by, the, base, of,

the, ediacaran, cambrian, boundary, dominated, by, cloudina, namacalathus, and, pseudoconodont, type, elements, a, sclerite, world, seeing, the, rise, of, halkieriids, tommotiids, and, hyoliths, lasting, to, the, end, of, the, fortunian, c, 525, ma, a, brachiopod, world, perhaps, corresponding, to, the, as, yet, unratified, cambrian, stage, 2, and, trilobite, world, kicking, off, in, stage, 3, complementary, to, the, shelly, fossil, record, trace, fossils, can, be, divided, into, five, subdivisions, flat, world, late, ediacaran, with, traces, restricted, to, the, sediment, surface,

cambrian, rusophycus, world, spanning, 536, to, 521, million, years, ago, and, thus, corresponding, exactly, to, the, periods, of, sclerite, world, and, brachiopod, world, under, the, ssf, paradigm, and, cruziana, world, with, an, obvious, correspondence, to, trilobite, world, there, is, strong, evidence, for, species, of, cnidaria, and, porifera, existing, in, the, ediacaran, and, possible, members, of, porifera, even, before, that, during, the, cryogenian, bryozoans, once, thought, to, not, appear, in, the, fossil, record, until, after, the, cambrian, are, now, known, from, strata, of, cambrian, age, 3, from, australia, and, south, china, the, fossil, record, as, darwin, knew, it, seemed, to, suggest, that, the, major, metazoan, groups, appeared, in, a, few, million, years, of, the, early, to, mid, cambrian, and, even, in, the, 1980s, this, still, appeared, to, be, the, case, however, evidence, of, precambrian, metazoa, is, gradually, accumulating, if, the, ediacaran, kimberella, was, a, mollusc, like, protostome, one, of, the, two, main, groups, of, coelomates, the, protostome, and, deuterostome, lineages, must, have, split, significantly, before, 550, million, years, ago, deuterostomes, are, the, other, main, group, of, coelomates, even, if, it, is, not, a, protostome, it, is, widely, accepted, as, a, bilaterian, since, fossils, of, rather, modern, looking, cnidarians, jellyfish, like, organisms, have, been, found, in, the, doushantuo, lagerst, tte, the, cnidarian, and, bilaterian, lineages, must, have, diverged, well, over, 580, million, years, ago, trace, fossils, and, predatory, borings, in, cloudina, shells, provide, further, evidence, of, ediacaran, animals, some, fossils, from, the, doushantuo, formation, have, been, interpreted, as, embryos, and, one, vernanimalcula, as, a, bilaterian, coelomate, although, these, interpretations, are, not, universally, accepted, earlier, still, predatory, pressure, has, acted, on, stromatolites, and, acritarchs, since, around, 1, 250, million, years, ago, some, say, that, the, evolutionary, change, was, accelerated, by, an, order, of, magnitude, but, the, presence, of, precambrian, animals, somewhat, dampens, the, bang, of, the, explosion, not, only, was, the, appearance, of, animals, gradual, but, their, evolutionary, radiation, diversification, may, also, not, have, been, as, rapid, as, once, thought, indeed, statistical, analysis, shows, that, the, cambrian, explosion, was, no, faster, than, any, of, the, other, radiations, in, animals, history, however, it, does, seem, that, some, innovations, linked, to, the, explosion, such, as, resistant, armour, only, evolved, once, in, the, animal, lineage, this, makes, a, lengthy, precambrian, animal, lineage, harder, to, defend, further, the, conventional, view, that, all, the, phyla, arose, in, the, cambrian, is, flawed, while, the, phyla, may, have, diversified, in, this, time, period, representatives, of, the, crown, groups, of, many, phyla, do, not, appear, until, much, later, in, the, phanerozoic, further, the, mineralised, phyla, that, form, the, basis, of, the, fossil, record, may, not, be, representative, of, other, phyla, since, most, mineralised, phyla, originated, in, a, benthic, setting, the, fossil, record, is, consistent, with, a, cambrian, explosion, that, was, limited, to, the, benthos, with, pelagic, phyla, evolving, much, later, ecological, complexity, among, marine, animals, increased, in, the, cambrian, as, well, later, in, the, ordovician, however, recent, research, has, overthrown, the, once, popular, idea, that, disparity, was, exceptionally, high, throughout, the, cambrian, before, subsequently, decreasing, in, fact, disparity, remains, relatively, low, throughout, the, cambrian, with, modern, levels, of, disparity, only, attained, after, the, early, ordovician, radiation, the, diversity, of, many, cambrian, assemblages, is, similar, to, today, s, and, at, a, high, class, phylum, level, diversity, is, thought, by, some, to, have, risen, relatively, smoothly, through, the, cambrian, stabilizing, somewhat, in, the, ordovician, this, interpretation, however, glosses, over, the, astonishing, and, fundamental, pattern, of, basal, polytomy, and, phylogenetic, telescoping, at, or, near, the, cambrian, boundary, as, seen, in, most, major, animal, lineages, thus, harry, blackmore, whittington, s, questions, regarding, the, abrupt, nature, of, the, cambrian, explosion, remain, and, have, yet, to, be, satisfactorily, answered, budd, and, mann, suggested, that, the, cambrian, explosion, was, the, result, of, a, type, of, survivorship, bias, called, the, push, of, the, past, as, groups, at, their, origin, tend, to, go, extinct, it, follows, that, any, long, lived, group, would, have, experienced, an, unusually, rapid, rate, of, diversification, early, on, creating, the, illusion, of, a, general, speed, up, in, diversification, rates, however, rates, of, diversification, could, remain, at, background, levels, and, still, generate, this, sort, of, effect, in, the, surviving, lineages, despite, the, evidence, that, moderately, complex, animals, triploblastic, bilaterians, existed, before, and, possibly, long, before, the, start, of, the, cambrian, it, seems, that, the, pace, of, evolution, was, exceptionally, fast, in, the, early, cambrian, possible, explanations, for, this, fall, into, three, broad, categories, environmental, developmental, and, ecological, changes, any, explanation, must, explain, both, the, timing, and, magnitude, of, the, explosion, earth, s, earliest, atmosphere, contained, no, free, oxygen, o, 2, the, oxygen, that, animals, breathe, today, both, in, the, air, and, dissolved, in, water, is, the, product, of, billions, of, years, of, photosynthesis, cyanobacteria, were, the, first, organisms, to, evolve, the, ability, to, photosynthesize, introducing, a, steady, supply, of, oxygen, into, the, environment, initially, oxygen, levels, did, not, increase, substantially, in, the, atmosphere, the, oxygen, quickly, reacted, with, iron, and, other, minerals, in, the, surrounding, rock, and, ocean, water, once, a, saturation, point, was, reached, for, the, reactions, in, rock, and, water, oxygen, was, able, to, exist, as, a, gas, in, its, diatomic, form, oxygen, levels, in, the, atmosphere, increased, substantially, afterward, as, a, general, trend, the, concentration, of, oxygen, in, the, atmosphere, has, risen, gradually, over, about, the, last, 2, 5, billion, years, oxygen, levels, seem, to, have, a, positive, correlation, with, diversity, in, eukaryotes, well, before, the, cambrian, period, the, last, common, ancestor, of, all, extant, eukaryotes, is, thought, to, have, lived, around, 1, 8, billion, years, ago, around, 800, million, years, ago, there, was, a, notable, increase, in, the, complexity, and, number, of, eukaryotes, species, in, the, fossil, record, before, the, spike, in, diversity, eukaryotes, are, thought, to, have, lived, in, highly, sulfuric, environments, sulfide, interferes, with, mitochondrial, function, in, aerobic, organisms, limiting, the, amount, of, oxygen, that, could, be, used, to, drive, metabolism, oceanic, sulfide, levels, decreased, around, 800, million, years, ago, which, supports, the, importance, of, oxygen, in, eukaryotic, diversity, the, increased, ventilation, of, the, oceans, by, sponges, which, had, already, evolved, and, diversified, during, the, late, neoproterozoic, has, been, proposed, to, have, increased, the, availability, of, oxygen, and, powered, the, cambrian, s, rapid, diversification, of, multicellular, life, molybdenum, isotopes, show, that, increases, in, biodiversity, were, strongly, correlated, with, expansion, of, oxygenated, bottom, waters, in, the, early, cambrian, lending, support, for, oxygen, as, a, driver, of, the, cambrian, evolutionary, radiation, the, shortage, of, oxygen, might, well, have, prevented, the, rise, of, large, complex, animals, the, amount, of, oxygen, an, animal, can, absorb, is, largely, determined, by, the, area, of, its, oxygen, absorbing, surfaces, lungs, and, gills, in, the, most, complex, animals, the, skin, in, less, complex, ones, while, the, amount, needed, is, determined, by, its, volume, which, grows, faster, than, the, oxygen, absorbing, area, if, an, animal, s, size, increases, equally, in, all, directions, an, increase, in, the, concentration, of, oxygen, in, air, or, water, would, increase, the, size, to, which, an, organism, could, grow, without, its, tissues, becoming, starved, of, oxygen, however, members, of, the, ediacara, biota, reached, metres, in, length, tens, of, millions, of, years, before, the, cambrian, explosion, other, metabolic, functions, may, have, been, inhibited, by, lack, of, oxygen, for, example, the, construction, of, tissue, such, as, collagen, which, is, required, for, the, construction, of, complex, structures, or, the, biosynthesis, of, molecules, for, the, construction, of, a, hard, exoskeleton, however, animals, were, not, affected, when, similar, oceanographic, conditions, occurred, in, the, phanerozoic, therefore, some, see, no, forcing, role, of, the, oxygen, level, on, evolution, the, amount, of, ozone, o, 3, required, to, shield, earth, from, biologically, lethal, uv, radiation, wavelengths, from, 200, to, 300, nanometers, nm, is, believed, to, have, been, in, existence, around, the, cambrian, explosion, the, presence, of, the, ozone, layer, may, have, enabled, the, development, of, complex, life, and, life, on, land, as, opposed, to, life, being, restricted, to, the, water, in, the, late, neoproterozoic, extending, into, the, early, ediacaran, period, the, earth, suffered, massive, glaciations, in, which, most, of, its, surface, was, covered, by, ice, this, may, have, caused, a, mass, extinction, creating, a, genetic, bottleneck, the, resulting, diversification, may, have, given, rise, to, the, ediacara, biota, which, appears, soon, after, the, last, snowball, earth, episode, however, the, snowball, episodes, occurred, a, long, time, before, the, start, of, the, cambrian, and, it, is, difficult, to, see, how, so, much, diversity, could, have, been, caused, by, even, a, series, of, bottlenecks, the, cold, periods, may, even, have, delayed, the, evolution, of, large, size, organisms, massive, rock, erosion, caused, by, glaciers, during, the, snowball, earth, may, have, deposited, nutrient, rich, sediments, into, the, oceans, setting, the, stage, for, the, cambrian, explosion, newer, research, suggests, that, volcanically, active, midocean, ridges, caused, a, massive, and, sudden, surge, of, the, calcium, concentration, in, the, oceans, making, it, possible, for, marine, organisms, to, build, skeletons, and, hard, body, parts, alternatively, a, high, influx, of, ions, could, have, been, provided, by, the, widespread, erosion, that, produced, powell, s, great, unconformity, an, increase, of, calcium, may, also, have, been, caused, by, erosion, of, the, transgondwanan, supermountain, that, existed, at, the, time, of, the, explosion, the, roots, of, the, mountain, are, preserved, in, present, day, east, africa, as, an, orogen, a, range, of, theories, are, based, on, the, concept, that, minor, modifications, to, animals, development, as, they, grow, from, embryo, to, adult, may, have, been, able, to, cause, very, large, changes, in, the, final, adult, form, the, hox, genes, for, example, control, which, organs, individual, regions, of, an, embryo, will, develop, into, for, instance, if, a, certain, hox, gene, is, expressed, a, region, will, develop, into, a, limb, if, a, different, hox, gene, is, expressed, in, that, region, a, minor, change, it, could, develop, into, an, eye, instead, a, phenotypically, major, change, such, a, system, allows, a, large, range, of, disparity, to, appear, from, a, limited, set, of, genes, but, such, theories, linking, this, with, the, explosion, struggle, to, explain, why, the, origin, of, such, a, development, system, should, by, itself, lead, to, increased, diversity, or, disparity, evidence, of, precambrian, metazoans, combines, with, molecular, data, to, show, that, much, of, the, genetic, architecture, that, could, feasibly, have, played, a, role, in, the, explosion, was, already, well, established, by, the, cambrian, this, apparent, paradox, is, addressed, in, a, theory, that, focuses, on, the, physics, of, development, it, is, proposed, that, the, emergence, of, simple, multicellular, forms, provided, a, changed, context, and, spatial, scale, in, which, novel, physical, processes, and, effects, were, mobilized, by, the, products, of, genes, that, had, previously, evolved, to, serve, unicellular, functions, morphological, complexity, layers, segments, lumens, appendages, arose, in, this, view, by, self, organization, horizontal, gene, transfer, has, also, been, identified, as, a, possible, factor, in, the, rapid, acquisition, of, the, biochemical, capability, of, biomineralization, among, organisms, during, this, period, based, on, evidence, that, the, gene, for, a, critical, protein, in, the, process, was, originally, transferred, from, a, bacterium, into, sponges, these, focus, on, the, interactions, between, different, types, of, organism, some, of, these, hypotheses, deal, with, changes, in, the, food, chain, some, suggest, arms, races, between, predators, and, prey, and, others, focus, on, the, more, general, mechanisms, of, coevolution, such, theories, are, well, suited, to, explaining, why, there, was, a, rapid, increase, in, both, disparity, and, diversity, but, they, do, not, explain, why, the, explosion, happened, when, it, did, evidence, for, such, an, extinction, includes, the, disappearance, from, the, fossil, record, of, the, ediacara, biota, and, shelly, fossils, such, as, cloudina, and, the, accompanying, perturbation, in, the, 13, c, record, it, is, suspected, that, several, global, anoxic, events, were, responsible, for, the, extinction, mass, extinctions, are, often, followed, by, adaptive, radiations, as, existing, clades, expand, to, occupy, the, ecospace, emptied, by, the, extinction, however, once, the, dust, had, settled, overall, disparity, and, diversity, returned, to, the, pre, extinction, level, in, each, of, the, phanerozoic, extinctions, the, late, ediacaran, oceans, appears, to, have, suffered, from, an, anoxia, that, covered, much, of, the, seafloor, which, would, have, given, mobile, animals, with, the, ability, to, seek, out, more, oxygen, rich, environments, an, advantage, over, sessile, forms, of, life, andrew, parker, has, proposed, that, predator, prey, relationships, changed, dramatically, after, eyesight, evolved, prior, to, that, time, hunting, and, evading, were, both, close, range, affairs, smell, chemoreception, vibration, and, touch, were, the, only, senses, used, when, predators, could, see, their, prey, from, a, distance, new, defensive, strategies, were, needed, armor, spines, and, similar, defenses, may, also, have, evolved, in, response, to, vision, he, further, observed, that, where, animals, lose, vision, in, unlighted, environments, such, as, caves, diversity, of, animal, forms, tends, to, decrease, nevertheless, many, scientists, doubt, that, vision, could, have, caused, the, explosion, eyes, may, well, have, evolved, long, before, the, start, of, the, cambrian, it, is, also, difficult, to, understand, why, the, evolution, of, eyesight, would, have, caused, an, explosion, since, other, senses, such, as, smell, and, pressure, detection, can, detect, things, at, a, greater, distance, in, the, sea, than, sight, can, but, the, appearance, of, these, other, senses, apparently, did, not, cause, an, evolutionary, explosion, one, hypothesis, posits, that, the, development, of, increased, cognitive, abilities, during, the, cambrian, drove, diversity, increase, this, is, evidenced, by, the, fact, that, the, novel, ecological, lifestyles, created, during, the, cambrian, required, rapid, regular, movement, a, feature, associated, with, brain, bearing, organisms, the, increasing, complexity, of, brains, positively, correlated, with, a, greater, range, of, motion, and, sensory, abilities, enabled, a, wider, range, of, novel, ecological, modes, of, life, to, come, into, being, the, ability, to, avoid, or, recover, from, predation, often, makes, the, difference, between, life, and, death, and, is, therefore, one, of, the, strongest, components, of, natural, selection, the, pressure, to, adapt, is, stronger, on, the, prey, than, on, the, predator, if, the, predator, fails, to, win, a, contest, it, loses, a, meal, if, the, prey, is, the, loser, it, loses, its, life, but, there, is, evidence, that, predation, was, rife, long, before, the, start, of, the, cambrian, for, example, in, the, increasingly, spiny, forms, of, acritarchs, the, holes, drilled, in, cloudina, shells, and, traces, of, burrowing, to, avoid, predators, hence, it, is, unlikely, that, the, appearance, of, predation, was, the, trigger, for, the, cambrian, explosion, although, it, may, well, have, exhibited, a, strong, influence, on, the, body, forms, that, the, explosion, produced, however, the, intensity, of, predation, does, appear, to, have, increased, dramatically, during, the, cambrian, as, new, predatory, tactics, such, as, shell, crushing, emerged, this, rise, of, predation, during, the, cambrian, was, confirmed, by, the, temporal, pattern, of, the, median, predator, ratio, at, the, scale, of, genus, in, fossil, communities, covering, the, cambrian, and, ordovician, periods, but, this, pattern, is, not, correlated, to, diversification, rate, this, lack, of, correlation, between, predator, ratio, and, diversification, over, the, cambrian, and, ordovician, suggests, that, predators, did, not, trigger, the, large, evolutionary, radiation, of, animals, during, this, interval, thus, the, role, of, predators, as, triggerers, of, diversification, may, have, been, limited, to, the, very, beginning, of, the, cambrian, explosion, geochemical, evidence, strongly, indicates, that, the, total, mass, of, plankton, has, been, similar, to, modern, levels, since, early, in, the, proterozoic, before, the, start, of, the, cambrian, their, corpses, and, droppings, were, too, small, to, fall, quickly, towards, the, seabed, since, their, drag, was, about, the, same, as, their, weight, this, meant, they, were, destroyed, by, scavengers, or, by, chemical, processes, before, they, reached, the, sea, floor, mesozooplankton, are, plankton, of, a, larger, size, early, cambrian, specimens, filtered, microscopic, plankton, from, the, seawater, these, larger, organisms, would, have, produced, droppings, and, ultimately, corpses, large, enough, to, fall, fairly, quickly, this, provided, a, new, supply, of, energy, and, nutrients, to, the, mid, levels, and, bottoms, of, the, seas, which, opened, up, a, new, range, of, possible, ways, of, life, if, any, of, these, remains, sank, uneaten, to, the, sea, floor, they, could, be, buried, this, would, have, taken, some, carbon, out, of, circulation, resulting, in, an, increase, in, the, concentration, of, breathable, oxygen, in, the, seas, carbon, readily, combines, with, oxygen, the, initial, herbivorous, mesozooplankton, were, probably, larvae, of, benthic, seafloor, animals, a, larval, stage, was, probably, an, evolutionary, innovation, driven, by, the, increasing, level, of, predation, at, the, seafloor, during, the, ediacaran, period, metazoans, have, an, amazing, ability, to, increase, diversity, through, coevolution, this, means, that, an, organism, s, traits, can, lead, to, traits, evolving, in, other, organisms, a, number, of, responses, are, possible, and, a, different, species, can, potentially, emerge, from, each, one, as, a, simple, example, the, evolution, of, predation, may, have, caused, one, organism, to, develop, a, defence, while, another, developed, motion, to, flee, this, would, cause, the, predator, lineage, to, diverge, into, two, species, one, that, was, good, at, chasing, prey, and, another, that, was, good, at, breaking, through, defences, actual, coevolution, is, somewhat, more, subtle, but, in, this, fashion, great, diversity, can, arise, three, quarters, of, living, species, are, animals, and, most, of, the, rest, have, formed, by, coevolution, with, animals, evolving, organisms, inevitably, change, the, environment, they, evolve, in, the, devonian, colonization, of, land, had, planet, wide, consequences, for, sediment, cycling, and, ocean, nutrients, and, was, likely, linked, to, the, devonian, mass, extinction, a, similar, process, may, have, occurred, on, smaller, scales, in, the, oceans, with, for, example, the, sponges, filtering, particles, from, the, water, and, depositing, them, in, the, mud, in, a, more, digestible, form, or, burrowing, organisms, making, previously, unavailable, resources, available, for, other, organisms, increases, in, burrowing, changed, the, seafloor, s, geochemistry, and, led, to, decreased, oxygen, in, the, ocean, and, increased, co, 2, levels, in, the, seas, and, the, atmosphere, resulting, in, global, warming, for, tens, of, millions, years, and, could, be, responsible, for, mass, extinctions, but, as, burrowing, became, established, it, allowed, an, explosion, of, its, own, for, as, burrowers, disturbed, the, sea, floor, they, aerated, it, mixing, oxygen, into, the, toxic, muds, this, made, the, bottom, sediments, more, hospitable, and, allowed, a, wider, range, of, organisms, to, inhabit, them, creating, new, niches, and, the, scope, for, higher, diversity, the, explosion, may, not, have, been, a, significant, evolutionary, event, it, may, represent, a, threshold, being, crossed, for, example, a, threshold, in, genetic, complexity, that, allowed, a, vast, range, of, morphological, forms, to, be, employed, this, genetic, threshold, may, have, a, correlation, to, the, amount, of, oxygen, available, to, organisms, using, oxygen, for, metabolism, produces, much, more, energy, than, anaerobic, processes, organisms, that, use, more, oxygen, have, the, opportunity, to, produce, more, complex, proteins, providing, a, template, for, further, evolution, these, proteins, translate, into, larger, more, complex, structures, that, allow, organisms, better, to, adapt, to, their, environments, with, the, help, of, oxygen, genes, that, code, for, these, proteins, could, contribute, to, the, expression, of, complex, traits, more, efficiently, access, to, a, wider, range, of, structures, and, functions, would, allow, organisms, to, evolve, in, different, directions, increasing, the, number, of, niches, that, could, be, inhabited, furthermore, organisms, had, the, opportunity, to, become, more, specialized, in, their, own, niches, after, an, extinction, at, the, cambrian, ordovician, boundary, another, radiation, occurred, which, established, the, taxa, that, would, dominate, the, palaeozoic, this, event, known, as, the, great, ordovician, biodiversification, event, gobe, has, been, considered, a, follow, up, to, the, cambrian, explosion, recent, studies, have, suggested, that, the, cambrian, explosion, were, not, two, discrete, events, but, one, long, evolutionary, radiation, analytical, study, of, the, geobiodiversity, database, gbdb, and, paleobiology, database, pbdb, failed, to, find, a, statistical, basis, for, separating, the, two, radiations, some, researchers, have, proposed, the, existence, of, a, biodiversity, gap, during, the, furongian, separating, the, cambrian, explosion, and, gobe, known, as, the, furongian, gap, studies, of, the, guole, konservat, lagerst, tte, and, similar, fossil, sites, in, south, china, have, instead, found, the, furongian, to, instead, be, a, time, of, rapid, biological, turnovers, though, making, the, existence, of, the, furongian, gap, highly, controversial, the, cambrian, explosion, can, be, viewed, as, two, waves, of, metazoan, expansion, into, empty, niches, first, a, coevolutionary, rise, in, diversity, as, animals, explored, niches, on, the, ediacaran, sea, floor, followed, by, a, second, expansion, in, the, early, cambrian, as, they, became, established, in, the, water, column, the, rate, of, diversification, seen, in, the, cambrian, phase, of, the, explosion, is, unparalleled, among, marine, animals, it, affected, all, metazoan, clades, of, which, cambrian, fossils, have, been, found, later, radiations, such, as, those, of, fish, in, the, silurian, and, devonian, periods, involved, fewer, taxa, mainly, with, very, similar, body, plans, although, the, recovery, from, the, permian, triassic, extinction, started, with, about, as, few, animal, species, as, the, cambrian, explosion, the, recovery, produced, far, fewer, significantly, new, types, of, animals, whatever, triggered, the, early, cambrian, diversification, opened, up, an, exceptionally, wide, range, of, previously, unavailable, ecological, niches, when, these, were, all, occupied, limited, space, existed, for, such, wide, ranging, diversifications, to, occur, again, because, strong, competition, existed, in, all, niches, and, incumbents, usually, had, the, advantage, if, a, wide, range, of, empty, niches, had, continued, clades, would, be, able, to, continue, diversifying, and, become, disparate, enough, for, us, to, recognise, them, as, different, phyla, when, niches, are, filled, lineages, will, continue, to, resemble, one, another, long, after, they, diverge, as, limited, opportunity, exists, for, them, to, change, their, life, styles, and, forms, there, were, two, similar, explosions, in, the, evolution, of, land, plants, after, a, cryptic, history, beginning, about, 450, million, years, ago, land, plants, underwent, a, uniquely, rapid, adaptive, radiation, during, the, devonian, period, about, 400, million, years, ago,
