sand, is, a, granular, material, composed, of, finely, divided, mineral, particles, sand, has, various, compositions, but, is, defined, by, its, grain, size, sand, grains, are, smaller, than, gravel, and, coarser, than, silt, sand, can, also, refer, to, a, textural, class, of, soil, or, soil, type, i, e, a, soil, containing, more, than, 85, percent, sand, sized, particles, by, mass, the, composition, of, sand, varies, depending, on, the, local, rock, sources, and, conditions, but, the, most, common, constituent, of, sand, in, inland, continental, settings, and, non, tropical, coastal, settings, is, silica, silicon, dioxide, or, sio, 2, usually, in, the, form, of, quartz, calcium, carbonate, is, the, second, most, common, type, of, sand, for, example, aragonite, which, has, mostly, been, created, over, the, past, 500, million, years, by, various, forms, of, life, like, coral, and, shellfish, for, example, it, is, the, primary, form, of, sand, apparent, in, areas, where, reefs, have, dominated, the, ecosystem, for, millions, of, years, as, in, the, caribbean, somewhat, more, rarely, sand, may, be, composed, of, calcium, sulfate, such, as, gypsum, and, selenite, as, is, found, in, places, such, as, white, sands, national, park, and, salt, plains, national, wildlife, refuge, in, the, u, s, sand, is, a, non, renewable, resource, over, human, timescales, and, sand, suitable, for, making, concrete, is, in, high, demand, desert, sand, although, plentiful, is, not, suitable, for, concrete, fifty, billion, tons, of, beach, sand, and, fossil, sand, are, used, each, year, for, construction, the, exact, definition, of, sand, varies, the, scientific, unified, soil, classification, system, used, in, engineering, and, geology, corresponds, to, us, standard, sieves, and, defines, sand, as, particles, with, a, diameter, of, between, 0, 074, and, 4, 75, millimeters, by, another, definition, in, terms, of, particle, size, as, used, by, geologists, sand, particles, range, in, diameter, from, 0, 0625, mm, or, 1, 16, mm, a, volume, of, approximately, 0, 00012, cubic, millimetres, to, 2, mm, a, volume, of, approximately, 4, 2, cubic, millimetres, the, difference, in, volumes, being, 34, 688, measures, difference, any, particle, falling, within, this, range, of, sizes, is, termed, a, sand, grain, sand, grains, are, between, gravel, with, particles, ranging, from, 2, mm, up, to, 64, mm, by, the, latter, system, and, from, 4, 75, mm, up, to, 75, mm, in, the, former, and, silt, particles, smaller, than, 0, 0625, mm, down, to, 0, 004, mm, the, size, specification, between, sand, and, gravel, has, remained, constant, for, more, than, a, century, but, particle, diameters, as, small, as, 0, 02, mm, were, considered, sand, under, the, albert, atterberg, standard, in, use, during, the, early, 20th, century, the, grains, of, sand, in, archimedes, the, sand, reckoner, written, around, 240, bce, were, 0, 02, mm, in, diameter, a, 1938, specification, of, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, was, 0, 05, mm, a, 1953, engineering, standard, published, by, the, american, association, of, state, highway, and, transportation, officials, set, the, minimum, sand, size, at, 0, 074, mm, sand, feels, gritty, when, rubbed, between, the, fingers, silt, by, comparison, feels, like, flour, iso, 14688, grades, sands, as, fine, medium, and, coarse, with, ranges, 0, 063, mm, to, 0, 2, mm, to, 0, 63, mm, to, 2, 0, mm, in, the, united, states, sand, is, commonly, divided, into, five, sub, categories, based, on, size, very, fine, sand, 1, 16, 1, 8, mm, diameter, fine, sand, 1, 8, mm, 1, 4, mm, medium, sand, 1, 4, mm, 1, 2, mm, coarse, sand, 1, 2, mm, 1, mm, and, very, coarse, sand, 1, mm, 2, mm, these, sizes, are, based, on, the, krumbein, phi, scale, where, size, is, log, 2, d, d, being, the, particle, size, in, mm, on, this, scale, for, sand, the, value, of, varies, from, 1, to, 4, with, the, divisions, between, sub, categories, at, whole, numbers, the, most, common, constituent, of, sand, in, inland, continental, settings, and, non, tropical, coastal, settings, is, silica, silicon, dioxide, or, sio, 2, usually, in, the, form, of, quartz, which, because, of, its, chemical, inertness, and, considerable, hardness, is, the, most, common, mineral, resistant, to, weathering, the, composition, of, mineral, sand, is, highly, variable, depending, on, the, local, rock, sources, and, conditions, the, bright, white, sands, found, in, tropical, and, subtropical, coastal, settings, are, eroded, limestone, and, may, contain, coral, and, shell, fragments, in, addition, to, other, organic, or, organically, derived, fragmental, material, suggesting, that, sand, formation, depends, on, living, organisms, too, the, gypsum, sand, dunes, of, the, white, sands, national, park, in, new, mexico, are, famous, for, their, bright, white, color, arkose, is, a, sand, or, sandstone, with, considerable, feldspar, content, derived, from, weathering, and, erosion, of, a, usually, nearby, granitic, rock, outcrop, some, sands, contain, magnetite, chlorite, glauconite, or, gypsum, sands, rich, in, magnetite, are, dark, to, black, in, color, as, are, sands, derived, from, volcanic, basalts, and, obsidian, chlorite, glauconite, bearing, sands, are, typically, green, in, color, as, are, sands, derived, from, basaltic, lava, with, a, high, olivine, content, many, sands, especially, those, found, extensively, in, southern, europe, have, iron, impurities, within, the, quartz, crystals, of, the, sand, giving, a, deep, yellow, color, sand, deposits, in, some, areas, contain, garnets, and, other, resistant, minerals, including, some, small, gemstones, rocks, erode, or, weather, over, a, long, period, of, time, mainly, by, water, and, wind, and, their, sediments, are, transported, downstream, these, sediments, continue, to, break, apart, into, smaller, pieces, until, they, become, fine, grains, of, sand, the, type, of, rock, the, sediment, originated, from, and, the, intensity, of, the, environment, give, different, compositions, of, sand, the, most, common, rock, to, form, sand, is, granite, where, the, feldspar, minerals, dissolve, faster, than, the, quartz, causing, the, rock, to, break, apart, into, small, pieces, in, high, energy, environments, rocks, break, apart, much, faster, than, in, more, calm, settings, in, granite, rocks, this, results, in, more, feldspar, minerals, in, the, sand, because, they, do, not, have, as, much, time, to, dissolve, away, the, term, for, sand, formed, by, weathering, is, epiclastic, sand, from, rivers, are, collected, either, from, the, river, itself, or, its, flood, plain, and, accounts, for, the, majority, of, the, sand, used, in, the, construction, industry, because, of, this, many, small, rivers, have, been, depleted, causing, environmental, concern, and, economic, losses, to, adjacent, land, the, rate, of, sand, mining, in, such, areas, greatly, outweighs, the, rate, the, sand, can, replenish, making, it, a, non, renewable, resource, sand, dunes, are, a, consequence, of, dry, conditions, or, wind, deposition, the, sahara, desert, is, very, dry, because, of, its, geographic, location, and, proximity, to, the, equator, it, is, known, for, its, vast, sand, dunes, which, exist, mainly, due, to, a, lack, of, vegetation, and, water, over, time, wind, blows, away, fine, particles, such, as, clay, and, dead, organic, matter, leaving, only, sand, and, larger, rocks, only, 15, of, the, sahara, is, sand, dunes, while, 70, is, bare, rock, the, wind, is, responsible, for, creating, these, different, environments, and, shaping, the, sand, to, be, round, and, smooth, these, properties, make, desert, sand, unusable, for, construction, beach, sand, is, also, formed, by, erosion, over, thousands, of, years, rocks, are, eroded, near, the, shoreline, from, the, constant, motion, of, waves, and, the, sediments, build, up, weathering, and, river, deposition, also, accelerate, the, process, of, creating, a, beach, along, with, marine, animals, interacting, with, rocks, such, as, eating, the, algae, off, of, them, once, there, is, a, sufficient, amount, of, sand, the, beach, acts, as, a, barrier, to, keep, the, land, from, eroding, any, further, this, sand, is, ideal, for, construction, as, it, is, angular, and, of, various, sizes, marine, sand, or, ocean, sand, comes, from, sediments, transported, into, the, ocean, and, the, erosion, of, ocean, rocks, the, thickness, of, the, sand, layer, varies, however, it, is, common, to, have, more, sand, closer, to, land, this, type, of, sand, is, ideal, for, construction, and, is, a, very, valuable, commodity, europe, is, the, main, miners, of, marine, sand, which, greatly, hurts, ecosystems, and, local, fisheries, the, study, of, individual, grains, can, reveal, much, historical, information, as, to, the, origin, and, kind, of, transport, of, the, grain, quartz, sand, that, is, recently, weathered, from, granite, or, gneiss, quartz, crystals, will, be, angular, it, is, called, grus, in, geology, or, sharp, sand, in, the, building, trade, where, it, is, preferred, for, concrete, and, in, gardening, where, it, is, used, as, a, soil, amendment, to, loosen, clay, soils, sand, that, is, transported, long, distances, by, water, or, wind, will, be, rounded, with, characteristic, abrasion, patterns, on, the, grain, surface, desert, sand, is, typically, rounded, people, who, collect, sand, as, a, hobby, are, known, as, arenophiles, organisms, that, thrive, in, sandy, environments, are, psammophiles, only, some, sands, are, suitable, for, the, construction, industry, for, example, for, making, concrete, grains, of, desert, sand, are, rounded, by, being, blown, in, the, wind, and, for, this, reason, do, not, produce, solid, concrete, unlike, the, rough, sand, from, the, sea, because, of, the, growth, of, population, and, of, cities, and, the, consequent, construction, activity, there, is, a, huge, demand, for, these, special, kinds, of, sand, and, natural, sources, are, running, low, in, 2012, french, director, denis, delestrac, made, a, documentary, called, sand, wars, about, the, impact, of, the, lack, of, construction, sand, it, shows, the, ecological, and, economic, effects, of, both, legal, and, illegal, trade, in, construction, sand, to, retrieve, the, sand, the, method, of, hydraulic, dredging, is, used, this, works, by, pumping, the, top, few, meters, of, sand, out, of, the, water, and, filling, it, into, a, boat, which, is, then, transported, back, to, land, for, processing, all, marine, life, mixed, in, with, the, extracted, sand, is, killed, and, the, ecosystem, can, continue, to, suffer, for, years, after, the, mining, is, complete, not, only, does, this, affect, marine, life, but, also, the, local, fishing, industries, because, of, the, loss, of, life, and, communities, living, close, to, the, water, s, edge, when, sand, is, taken, out, of, the, water, it, increases, the, risk, of, landslides, which, can, lead, to, loss, of, agricultural, land, and, or, damage, to, dwellings, sand, s, many, uses, require, a, significant, dredging, industry, raising, environmental, concerns, over, fish, depletion, landslides, and, flooding, countries, such, as, china, indonesia, malaysia, and, cambodia, ban, sand, exports, citing, these, issues, as, a, major, factor, it, is, estimated, that, the, annual, consumption, of, sand, and, gravel, is, 40, billion, tons, and, sand, is, a, us, 70, billion, global, industry, with, increasing, use, more, is, expected, to, come, from, recycling, and, alternatives, to, sand, the, global, demand, for, sand, in, 2017, was, 9, 55, billion, tons, as, part, of, a, 99, 5, billion, industry, in, april, 2022, the, united, nations, environment, programme, unep, published, a, report, stating, that, 50, billion, tons, of, sand, and, gravel, were, being, used, every, year, the, report, made, 10, recommendations, including, a, ban, on, beach, extraction, to, avert, a, crisis, and, move, toward, a, circular, economy, for, the, two, resources, while, sand, is, generally, non, toxic, sand, using, activities, such, as, sandblasting, require, precautions, bags, of, silica, sand, used, for, sandblasting, now, carry, labels, warning, the, user, to, wear, respiratory, protection, to, avoid, breathing, the, resulting, fine, silica, dust, safety, data, sheets, for, silica, sand, state, that, excessive, inhalation, of, crystalline, silica, is, a, serious, health, concern, in, areas, of, high, pore, water, pressure, sand, and, salt, water, can, form, quicksand, which, is, a, colloid, hydrogel, that, behaves, like, a, liquid, quicksand, produces, a, considerable, barrier, to, escape, for, creatures, caught, within, who, often, die, from, exposure, not, from, submersion, as, a, result, people, sometimes, dig, holes, in, the, sand, at, beaches, for, recreational, purposes, but, if, too, deep, they, can, result, in, serious, injury, or, death, in, the, event, of, a, collapse, manufactured, sand, m, sand, is, sand, made, from, rock, by, artificial, processes, usually, for, construction, purposes, in, cement, or, concrete, it, differs, from, river, sand, by, being, more, angular, and, has, somewhat, different, properties, in, dubai, united, arab, emirates, the, use, of, sand, has, been, very, demanding, in, the, construction, of, infrastructure, and, creating, new, islands, they, used, up, their, own, reserves, and, also, imported, sand, from, australia, there, have, been, three, projects, to, create, artificial, islands, needing, more, than, 835, million, tonnes, of, sand, which, cost, more, than, us, 26, billion, earth, sciences, portal
