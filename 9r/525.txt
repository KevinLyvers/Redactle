polypropylene, pp, also, known, as, polypropene, is, a, thermoplastic, polymer, used, in, a, wide, variety, of, applications, it, is, produced, via, chain, growth, polymerization, from, the, monomer, propylene, polypropylene, belongs, to, the, group, of, polyolefins, and, is, partially, crystalline, and, non, polar, its, properties, are, similar, to, polyethylene, but, it, is, slightly, harder, and, more, heat, resistant, it, is, a, white, mechanically, rugged, material, and, has, a, high, chemical, resistance, polypropylene, is, the, second, most, widely, produced, commodity, plastic, after, polyethylene, phillips, petroleum, chemists, j, paul, hogan, and, robert, banks, first, demonstrated, the, polymerization, of, propylene, in, 1951, the, stereoselective, polymerization, to, the, isotactic, was, discovered, by, giulio, natta, and, karl, rehn, in, march, 1954, this, pioneering, discovery, led, to, large, scale, commercial, production, of, isotactic, polypropylene, by, the, italian, firm, montecatini, from, 1957, onwards, syndiotactic, polypropylene, was, also, first, synthesized, by, natta, interest, in, polypropylene, development, is, ongoing, to, the, present, for, example, making, polypropylene, from, bio, based, resources, is, a, topic, of, interest, in, the, 21st, century, polypropylene, is, in, little, aspects, similar, to, polyethylene, especially, in, solution, behavior, and, electrical, properties, the, methyl, group, improves, mechanical, properties, and, thermal, resistance, although, the, chemical, resistance, decreases, 19, the, properties, of, polypropylene, depend, on, the, molecular, weight, and, molecular, weight, distribution, crystallinity, type, and, proportion, of, comonomer, if, used, and, the, iso, tacticity, in, isotactic, polypropylene, for, example, the, methyl, groups, are, oriented, on, one, side, of, the, carbon, backbone, this, arrangement, creates, a, greater, degree, of, crystallinity, and, results, in, a, stiffer, material, that, is, more, resistant, to, creep, than, both, atactic, polypropylene, and, polyethylene, the, density, of, pp, is, between, 0, 895, and, 0, 93, g, cm, 3, therefore, pp, is, the, commodity, plastic, with, the, lowest, density, with, lower, density, moldings, parts, with, lower, weight, and, more, parts, of, a, certain, mass, of, plastic, can, be, produced, unlike, polyethylene, crystalline, and, amorphous, regions, differ, only, slightly, in, their, density, however, the, density, of, polyethylene, can, significantly, change, with, fillers, 24, the, young, s, modulus, of, pp, is, between, 1300, and, 1800, n, mm, polypropylene, is, normally, tough, and, flexible, especially, when, copolymerized, with, ethylene, this, allows, polypropylene, to, be, used, as, an, engineering, plastic, competing, with, materials, such, as, acrylonitrile, butadiene, styrene, abs, polypropylene, is, reasonably, economical, polypropylene, has, good, resistance, to, fatigue, 3070, the, melting, point, of, polypropylene, occurs, in, a, range, so, the, melting, point, is, determined, by, finding, the, highest, temperature, of, a, differential, scanning, calorimetry, chart, perfectly, isotactic, pp, has, a, melting, point, of, 171, c, 340, f, commercial, isotactic, pp, has, a, melting, point, that, ranges, from, 160, to, 166, c, 320, to, 331, f, depending, on, atactic, material, and, crystallinity, syndiotactic, pp, with, a, crystallinity, of, 30, has, a, melting, point, of, 130, c, 266, f, below, 0, c, pp, becomes, brittle, the, thermal, expansion, of, pp, is, significant, but, somewhat, less, than, that, of, polyethylene, propylene, molecules, prefer, to, join, together, head, to, tail, giving, a, chain, with, methyl, groups, on, every, other, carbon, but, some, randomness, occurs, polypropylene, at, room, temperature, is, resistant, to, fats, and, almost, all, organic, solvents, apart, from, strong, oxidants, non, oxidizing, acids, and, bases, can, be, stored, in, containers, made, of, pp, at, elevated, temperature, pp, can, be, dissolved, in, nonpolar, solvents, such, as, xylene, tetralin, and, decalin, due, to, the, tertiary, carbon, atom, pp, is, chemically, less, resistant, than, pe, see, markovnikov, rule, most, commercial, polypropylene, is, isotactic, and, has, an, intermediate, level, of, crystallinity, between, that, of, low, density, polyethylene, ldpe, and, high, density, polyethylene, hdpe, isotactic, atactic, polypropylene, is, soluble, in, p, xylene, at, 140, c, isotactic, precipitates, when, the, solution, is, cooled, to, 25, c, and, atactic, portion, remains, soluble, in, p, xylene, the, melt, flow, rate, mfr, or, melt, flow, index, mfi, is, a, measure, of, molecular, weight, of, polypropylene, the, measure, helps, to, determine, how, easily, the, molten, raw, material, will, flow, during, processing, polypropylene, with, higher, mfr, will, fill, the, plastic, mold, more, easily, during, the, injection, or, blow, molding, production, process, as, the, melt, flow, increases, however, some, physical, properties, like, impact, strength, will, decrease, there, are, three, general, types, of, polypropylene, homopolymer, random, copolymer, and, block, copolymer, the, comonomer, is, typically, used, with, ethylene, ethylene, propylene, rubber, or, epdm, added, to, polypropylene, homopolymer, increases, its, low, temperature, impact, strength, randomly, polymerized, ethylene, monomer, added, to, polypropylene, homopolymer, decreases, the, polymer, crystallinity, lowers, the, melting, point, and, makes, the, polymer, more, transparent, polypropylene, can, be, categorized, as, atactic, polypropylene, app, syndiotactic, polypropylene, spp, and, isotactic, polypropylene, ipp, in, case, of, atactic, polypropylene, the, methyl, group, ch, 3, is, randomly, aligned, alternating, alternating, for, syndiotactic, polypropylene, and, evenly, for, isotactic, polypropylene, this, has, an, impact, on, the, crystallinity, amorphous, or, semi, crystalline, and, the, thermal, properties, expressed, as, glass, transition, point, t, g, and, melting, point, t, m, the, term, tacticity, describes, for, polypropylene, how, the, methyl, group, is, oriented, in, the, polymer, chain, commercial, polypropylene, is, usually, isotactic, this, article, therefore, always, refers, to, isotactic, polypropylene, unless, stated, otherwise, the, tacticity, is, usually, indicated, in, percent, using, the, isotactic, index, according, to, din, 16774, the, index, is, measured, by, determining, the, fraction, of, the, polymer, insoluble, in, boiling, heptane, commercially, available, polypropylenes, usually, have, an, isotactic, index, between, 85, and, 95, the, tacticity, effects, the, polymers, physical, properties, as, the, methyl, group, is, in, isotactic, propylene, consistently, located, at, the, same, side, it, forces, the, macromolecule, in, a, helical, shape, as, also, found, in, starch, an, isotactic, structure, leads, to, a, semi, crystalline, polymer, the, higher, the, isotonicity, the, isotactic, fraction, the, greater, the, crystallinity, and, thus, also, the, softening, point, rigidity, e, modulus, and, hardness, 22, atactic, polypropylene, on, the, other, hand, lacks, any, regularity, which, prevents, it, from, crystallization, thereby, creating, an, amorphous, material, isotactic, polypropylene, has, a, high, degree, of, crystallinity, in, industrial, products, 30, 60, syndiotactic, polypropylene, is, slightly, less, crystalline, atactic, pp, is, amorphous, not, crystalline, 251, is, polypropylene, can, exist, in, various, crystalline, modifications, which, differ, by, the, molecular, arrangement, of, the, polymer, chains, the, crystalline, modifications, are, categorized, into, the, and, modification, as, well, as, mesomorphic, smectic, forms, the, modifications, is, predominant, in, ipp, such, crystals, are, built, from, lamellae, in, the, form, of, folded, chains, a, characteristic, anomaly, is, that, the, lame, are, arranged, in, the, so, called, cross, hatched, structure, the, melting, point, of, crystalline, regions, is, given, as, 185, to, 220, c, the, density, as, 0, 936, to, 0, 946, g, cm, 3, the, modification, is, in, comparison, somewhat, less, ordered, as, a, result, of, which, it, forms, faster, and, has, a, lower, melting, point, of, 170, to, 200, c, the, formation, of, the, modification, can, be, promoted, by, nucleating, agents, suitable, temperatures, and, shear, stress, the, modification, is, hardly, formed, under, the, conditions, used, in, industry, and, is, poorly, understood, the, mesomorphic, modification, however, occurs, often, in, industrial, processing, since, the, plastic, is, usually, cooled, quickly, the, degree, of, order, of, the, mesomorphic, phase, ranges, between, the, crystalline, and, the, amorphous, phase, its, density, is, with, 0, 916, g, cm, 3, comparatively, the, mesomorphic, phase, is, considered, as, cause, for, the, transparency, in, rapidly, cooled, films, due, to, low, order, and, small, crystallites, syndiotactic, polypropylene, was, discovered, much, later, than, isotactic, pp, and, could, only, be, prepared, by, using, metallocene, catalysts, syndiotactic, pp, has, a, lower, melting, point, with, 161, to, 186, c, depending, on, the, degree, of, tacticity, atactic, polypropylene, is, amorphous, and, has, therefore, no, crystal, structure, due, to, its, lack, of, crystallinity, it, is, readily, soluble, even, at, moderate, temperatures, which, allows, to, separate, it, as, by, product, from, isotactic, polypropylene, by, extraction, however, the, app, obtained, this, way, is, not, completely, amorphous, but, can, still, contain, 15, crystalline, parts, atactic, polypropylene, can, also, be, produced, selectively, using, metallocene, catalysts, atactic, polypropylene, produced, this, way, has, a, considerably, higher, molecular, weight, atactic, polypropylene, has, lower, density, melting, point, and, softening, temperature, than, the, crystalline, types, and, is, tacky, and, rubber, like, at, room, temperature, it, is, a, colorless, cloudy, material, and, can, be, used, between, 15, and, 120, c, atactic, polypropylene, is, used, as, a, sealant, as, an, insulating, material, for, automobiles, and, as, an, additive, to, bitumen, polypropylene, copolymers, are, in, use, as, well, a, particularly, important, one, is, polypropylene, random, copolymer, ppr, or, pp, r, a, random, copolymer, with, polyethylene, used, for, plastic, pipework, polypropylene, random, crystallinity, temperature, pp, rct, also, used, for, plastic, pipework, is, a, new, form, of, this, plastic, it, achieves, higher, strength, at, high, temperature, by, crystallization, polypropylene, is, liable, to, chain, degradation, from, exposure, to, temperatures, above, 100, c, oxidation, usually, occurs, at, the, tertiary, carbon, centers, leading, to, chain, breaking, via, reaction, with, oxygen, in, external, applications, degradation, is, evidenced, by, cracks, and, crazing, it, may, be, protected, by, the, use, of, various, polymer, stabilizers, including, uv, absorbing, additives, and, anti, oxidants, such, as, phosphites, e, g, tris, 2, 4, di, tert, butylphenyl, phosphite, and, hindered, phenols, which, prevent, polymer, degradation, microbial, communities, isolated, from, soil, samples, mixed, with, starch, have, been, shown, to, be, capable, of, degrading, polypropylene, polypropylene, has, been, reported, to, degrade, while, in, the, human, body, as, implantable, mesh, devices, the, degraded, material, forms, a, tree, bark, like, layer, at, the, surface, of, mesh, fibers, pp, can, be, made, translucent, when, uncolored, but, is, not, as, readily, made, transparent, as, polystyrene, acrylic, or, certain, other, plastics, it, is, often, opaque, or, colored, using, pigments, polypropylene, is, produced, by, the, chain, growth, polymerization, of, propene, the, industrial, production, processes, can, be, grouped, into, gas, phase, polymerization, bulk, polymerization, and, slurry, polymerization, all, state, of, the, art, processes, use, either, gas, phase, or, bulk, reactor, systems, the, properties, of, pp, are, strongly, affected, by, its, tacticity, the, orientation, of, the, methyl, groups, ch, 3, relative, to, the, methyl, groups, in, neighboring, monomer, units, see, above, the, tacticity, of, polypropylene, can, be, chosen, by, the, choice, of, an, appropriate, catalyst, the, properties, of, pp, are, strongly, affected, by, its, tacticity, the, orientation, of, the, methyl, groups, ch, 3, in, the, figure, relative, to, the, methyl, groups, in, neighboring, monomer, units, a, ziegler, natta, catalyst, is, able, to, restrict, linking, of, monomer, molecules, to, a, specific, orientation, either, isotactic, when, all, methyl, groups, are, positioned, at, the, same, side, with, respect, to, the, backbone, of, the, polymer, chain, or, syndiotactic, when, the, positions, of, the, methyl, groups, alternate, commercially, available, isotactic, polypropylene, is, made, with, two, types, of, ziegler, natta, catalysts, the, first, group, of, the, catalysts, encompasses, solid, mostly, supported, catalysts, and, certain, types, of, soluble, metallocene, catalysts, such, isotactic, macromolecules, coil, into, a, helical, shape, these, helices, then, line, up, next, to, one, another, to, form, the, crystals, that, give, commercial, isotactic, polypropylene, many, of, its, desirable, properties, another, type, of, metallocene, catalysts, produce, syndiotactic, polypropylene, these, macromolecules, also, coil, into, helices, of, a, different, type, and, crystallize, atactic, polypropylene, is, an, amorphous, rubbery, material, it, can, be, produced, commercially, either, with, a, special, type, of, supported, ziegler, natta, catalyst, or, with, some, metallocene, catalysts, modern, supported, ziegler, natta, catalysts, developed, for, the, polymerization, of, propylene, and, other, 1, alkenes, to, isotactic, polymers, usually, use, ticl, 4, as, an, active, ingredient, and, mgcl, 2, as, a, support, the, catalysts, also, contain, organic, modifiers, either, aromatic, acid, esters, and, diesters, or, ethers, these, catalysts, are, activated, with, special, cocatalysts, containing, an, organoaluminum, compound, such, as, al, c, 2, h, 5, 3, and, the, second, type, of, a, modifier, the, catalysts, are, differentiated, depending, on, the, procedure, used, for, fashioning, catalyst, particles, from, mgcl, 2, and, depending, on, the, type, of, organic, modifiers, employed, during, catalyst, preparation, and, use, in, polymerization, reactions, two, most, important, technological, characteristics, of, all, the, supported, catalysts, are, high, productivity, and, a, high, fraction, of, the, crystalline, isotactic, polymer, they, produce, at, 70, 80, c, under, standard, polymerization, conditions, commercial, synthesis, of, isotactic, polypropylene, is, usually, carried, out, either, in, the, medium, of, liquid, propylene, or, in, gas, phase, reactors, commercial, synthesis, of, syndiotactic, polypropylene, is, carried, out, with, the, use, of, a, special, class, of, metallocene, catalysts, they, employ, bridged, bis, metallocene, complexes, of, the, type, bridge, cp, 1, cp, 2, zrcl, 2, where, the, first, cp, ligand, is, the, cyclopentadienyl, group, the, second, cp, ligand, is, the, fluorenyl, group, and, the, bridge, between, the, two, cp, ligands, is, ch, 2, ch, 2, sime, 2, or, siph, 2, these, complexes, are, converted, to, polymerization, catalysts, by, activating, them, with, a, special, organoaluminum, cocatalyst, methylaluminoxane, mao, melting, process, of, polypropylene, can, be, achieved, via, extrusion, and, molding, common, extrusion, methods, include, production, of, melt, blown, and, spun, bond, fibers, to, form, long, rolls, for, future, conversion, into, a, wide, range, of, useful, products, such, as, face, masks, filters, diapers, and, wipes, the, most, common, shaping, technique, is, injection, molding, which, is, used, for, parts, such, as, cups, cutlery, vials, caps, containers, housewares, and, automotive, parts, such, as, batteries, the, related, techniques, of, blow, molding, and, injection, stretch, blow, molding, are, also, used, which, involve, both, extrusion, and, molding, the, large, number, of, end, use, applications, for, polypropylene, are, often, possible, because, of, the, ability, to, tailor, grades, with, specific, molecular, properties, and, additives, during, its, manufacture, for, example, antistatic, additives, can, be, added, to, help, polypropylene, surfaces, resist, dust, and, dirt, many, physical, finishing, techniques, can, also, be, used, on, polypropylene, such, as, machining, surface, treatments, can, be, applied, to, polypropylene, parts, in, order, to, promote, adhesion, of, printing, ink, and, paints, expanded, polypropylene, epp, has, been, produced, through, both, solid, and, melt, state, processing, epp, is, manufactured, using, melt, processing, with, either, chemical, or, physical, blowing, agents, expansion, of, pp, in, solid, state, due, to, its, highly, crystalline, structure, has, not, been, successful, in, this, regard, two, novel, strategies, were, developed, for, expansion, of, pp, it, was, observed, that, pp, can, be, expanded, to, make, epp, through, controlling, its, crystalline, structure, or, through, blending, with, other, polymers, when, polypropylene, film, is, extruded, and, stretched, in, both, the, machine, direction, and, across, machine, direction, it, is, called, biaxially, oriented, polypropylene, two, methods, are, widely, used, for, producing, bopp, films, namely, a, bi, directional, stenter, process, or, a, double, bubble, blown, film, extrusion, process, biaxial, orientation, increases, strength, and, clarity, bopp, is, widely, used, as, a, packaging, material, for, packaging, products, such, as, snack, foods, fresh, produce, and, confectionery, it, is, easy, to, coat, print, and, laminate, to, give, the, required, appearance, and, properties, for, use, as, a, packaging, material, this, process, is, normally, called, converting, it, is, normally, produced, in, large, rolls, which, are, slit, on, slitting, machines, into, smaller, rolls, for, use, on, packaging, machines, bopp, is, also, used, for, stickers, and, labels, in, addition, to, opp, it, is, non, reactive, which, makes, bopp, suitable, for, safe, use, in, the, pharmaceutical, and, food, industry, it, is, one, of, the, most, important, commercial, polyolefin, films, bopp, films, are, available, in, different, thicknesses, and, widths, they, are, transparent, and, flexible, as, polypropylene, is, resistant, to, fatigue, most, plastic, living, hinges, such, as, those, on, flip, top, bottles, are, made, from, this, material, however, it, is, important, to, ensure, that, chain, molecules, are, oriented, across, the, hinge, to, maximise, strength, polypropylene, is, used, in, the, manufacturing, of, piping, systems, both, ones, concerned, with, high, purity, and, ones, designed, for, strength, and, rigidity, e, g, those, intended, for, use, in, potable, plumbing, hydronic, heating, and, cooling, and, reclaimed, water, this, material, is, often, chosen, for, its, resistance, to, corrosion, and, chemical, leaching, its, resilience, against, most, forms, of, physical, damage, including, impact, and, freezing, its, environmental, benefits, and, its, ability, to, be, joined, by, heat, fusion, rather, than, gluing, many, plastic, items, for, medical, or, laboratory, use, can, be, made, from, polypropylene, because, it, can, withstand, the, heat, in, an, autoclave, its, heat, resistance, also, enables, it, to, be, used, as, the, manufacturing, material, of, consumer, grade, kettles, food, containers, made, from, it, will, not, melt, in, the, dishwasher, and, do, not, melt, during, industrial, hot, filling, processes, for, this, reason, most, plastic, tubs, for, dairy, products, are, polypropylene, sealed, with, aluminum, foil, both, heat, resistant, materials, after, the, product, has, cooled, the, tubs, are, often, given, lids, made, of, a, less, heat, resistant, material, such, as, ldpe, or, polystyrene, such, containers, provide, a, good, hands, on, example, of, the, difference, in, modulus, since, the, rubbery, softer, more, flexible, feeling, of, ldpe, with, respect, to, polypropylene, of, the, same, thickness, is, readily, apparent, rugged, translucent, reusable, plastic, containers, made, in, a, wide, variety, of, shapes, and, sizes, for, consumers, from, various, companies, such, as, rubbermaid, and, sterilite, are, commonly, made, of, polypropylene, although, the, lids, are, often, made, of, somewhat, more, flexible, ldpe, so, they, can, snap, onto, the, container, to, close, it, polypropylene, can, also, be, made, into, disposable, bottles, to, contain, liquid, powdered, or, similar, consumer, products, although, hdpe, and, polyethylene, terephthalate, are, commonly, also, used, to, make, bottles, plastic, pails, car, batteries, wastebaskets, pharmacy, prescription, bottles, cooler, containers, dishes, and, pitchers, are, often, made, of, polypropylene, or, hdpe, both, of, which, commonly, have, rather, similar, appearance, feel, and, properties, at, ambient, temperature, an, abundance, of, medical, devices, are, made, from, pp, a, common, application, for, polypropylene, is, as, biaxially, oriented, polypropylene, bopp, these, bopp, sheets, are, used, to, make, a, wide, variety, of, materials, including, clear, bags, when, polypropylene, is, biaxially, oriented, it, becomes, crystal, clear, and, serves, as, an, excellent, packaging, material, for, artistic, and, retail, products, polypropylene, highly, colorfast, is, widely, used, in, manufacturing, carpets, rugs, and, mats, to, be, used, at, home, polypropylene, is, widely, used, in, ropes, distinctive, because, they, are, light, enough, to, float, in, water, for, equal, mass, and, construction, polypropylene, rope, is, similar, in, strength, to, polyester, rope, polypropylene, costs, less, than, most, other, synthetic, fibers, polypropylene, is, also, used, as, an, alternative, to, polyvinyl, chloride, pvc, as, insulation, for, electrical, cables, for, lszh, cable, in, low, ventilation, environments, primarily, tunnels, this, is, because, it, emits, less, smoke, and, no, toxic, halogens, which, may, lead, to, production, of, acid, in, high, temperature, conditions, polypropylene, is, also, used, in, particular, roofing, membranes, as, the, waterproofing, top, layer, of, single, ply, systems, as, opposed, to, modified, bit, systems, polypropylene, is, most, commonly, used, for, plastic, moldings, wherein, it, is, injected, into, a, mold, while, molten, forming, complex, shapes, at, relatively, low, cost, and, high, volume, examples, include, bottle, tops, bottles, and, fittings, it, can, also, be, produced, in, sheet, form, widely, used, for, the, production, of, stationery, folders, packaging, and, storage, boxes, the, wide, color, range, durability, low, cost, and, resistance, to, dirt, make, it, ideal, as, a, protective, cover, for, papers, and, other, materials, it, is, used, in, rubik, s, cube, stickers, because, of, these, characteristics, the, availability, of, sheet, polypropylene, has, provided, an, opportunity, for, the, use, of, the, material, by, designers, the, light, weight, durable, and, colorful, plastic, makes, an, ideal, medium, for, the, creation, of, light, shades, and, a, number, of, designs, have, been, developed, using, interlocking, sections, to, create, elaborate, designs, polypropylene, fibres, are, used, as, a, concrete, additive, to, increase, strength, and, reduce, cracking, and, spalling, in, some, areas, susceptible, to, earthquakes, e, g, california, pp, fibers, are, added, with, soils, to, improve, the, soil, s, strength, and, damping, when, constructing, the, foundation, of, structures, such, as, buildings, bridges, etc, polypropylene, is, a, major, polymer, used, in, nonwovens, with, over, 50, used, for, diapers, or, sanitary, products, where, it, is, treated, to, absorb, water, hydrophilic, rather, than, naturally, repelling, water, hydrophobic, other, non, woven, uses, include, filters, for, air, gas, and, liquids, in, which, the, fibers, can, be, formed, into, sheets, or, webs, that, can, be, pleated, to, form, cartridges, or, layers, that, filter, in, various, efficiencies, in, the, 0, 5, to, 30, micrometre, range, such, applications, occur, in, houses, as, water, filters, or, in, air, conditioning, type, filters, the, high, surface, area, and, naturally, oleophilic, polypropylene, nonwovens, are, ideal, absorbers, of, oil, spills, with, the, familiar, floating, barriers, near, oil, spills, on, rivers, polypropylene, or, polypro, has, been, used, for, the, fabrication, of, cold, weather, base, layers, such, as, long, sleeve, shirts, or, long, underwear, polypropylene, is, also, used, in, warm, weather, clothing, in, which, it, transports, sweat, away, from, the, skin, polyester, has, replaced, polypropylene, in, these, applications, in, the, u, s, military, such, as, in, the, ecwcs, although, polypropylene, clothes, are, not, easily, flammable, they, can, melt, which, may, result, in, severe, burns, if, the, wearer, is, involved, in, an, explosion, or, fire, of, any, kind, polypropylene, undergarments, are, known, for, retaining, body, odors, which, are, then, difficult, to, remove, the, current, generation, of, polyester, does, not, have, this, disadvantage, its, most, common, medical, use, is, in, the, synthetic, nonabsorbable, suture, prolene, manufactured, by, ethicon, inc, polypropylene, has, been, used, in, hernia, and, pelvic, organ, prolapse, repair, operations, to, protect, the, body, from, new, hernias, in, the, same, location, a, small, patch, of, the, material, is, placed, over, the, spot, of, the, hernia, below, the, skin, and, is, painless, and, rarely, if, ever, rejected, by, the, body, however, a, polypropylene, mesh, will, erode, the, tissue, surrounding, it, over, the, uncertain, period, from, days, to, years, a, notable, application, was, as, a, transvaginal, mesh, used, to, treat, vaginal, prolapse, and, concurrent, urinary, incontinence, due, to, the, above, mentioned, propensity, for, polypropylene, mesh, to, erode, the, tissue, surrounding, it, the, fda, has, issued, several, warnings, on, the, use, of, polypropylene, mesh, medical, kits, for, certain, applications, in, pelvic, organ, prolapse, specifically, when, introduced, in, close, proximity, to, the, vaginal, wall, due, to, a, continued, increase, in, number, of, mesh, driven, tissue, erosions, reported, by, patients, over, the, past, few, years, on, 3, january, 2012, the, fda, ordered, 35, manufacturers, of, these, mesh, products, to, study, the, side, effects, of, these, devices, due, to, the, outbreak, of, the, covid, 19, pandemic, in, 2020, the, demand, for, pp, has, increased, significantly, because, it, is, a, vital, raw, material, for, producing, meltblown, fabric, which, is, in, turn, the, raw, material, for, producing, facial, masks, most, polypropylene, recycling, uses, mechanical, recycling, as, for, polyethylene, the, material, is, heated, to, soften, or, melt, it, and, mechanically, formed, it, into, new, products, as, of, 2015, less, than, 1, of, polypropylene, generated, was, recycled, heating, degrades, the, carbon, backbone, more, severely, than, for, polyethylene, breaking, it, into, smaller, organic, molecules, because, the, methyl, side, group, of, pp, is, susceptible, to, thermo, oxidative, and, photo, oxidative, degradation, polypropylene, has, the, number, 5, as, its, resin, identification, code, pp, objects, can, be, joined, with, a, two, part, epoxy, glue, or, using, hot, glue, guns, pp, can, be, melted, using, a, speed, tip, welding, technique, with, speed, welding, the, plastic, welder, similar, to, a, soldering, iron, in, appearance, and, wattage, is, fitted, with, a, feed, tube, for, the, plastic, weld, rod, the, speed, tip, heats, the, rod, and, the, substrate, while, at, the, same, time, it, presses, the, molten, weld, rod, into, position, a, bead, of, softened, plastic, is, laid, into, the, joint, and, the, parts, and, weld, rod, fuse, with, polypropylene, the, melted, welding, rod, must, be, mixed, with, the, semi, melted, base, material, being, fabricated, or, repaired, a, speed, tip, gun, is, essentially, a, soldering, iron, with, a, broad, flat, tip, that, can, be, used, to, melt, the, weld, joint, and, filler, material, to, create, a, bond, the, advocacy, organization, environmental, working, group, classifies, pp, as, of, low, hazard, pp, is, dope, dyed, no, water, is, used, in, its, dyeing, in, contrast, with, cotton, like, all, organic, compounds, polypropylene, is, combustible, the, flash, point, of, a, typical, composition, is, 260, c, autoignition, temperature, is, 388, c
