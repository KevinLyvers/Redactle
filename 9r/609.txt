gravel, r, v, l, is, a, loose, aggregation, of, rock, fragments, gravel, occurs, naturally, on, earth, as, a, result, of, sedimentary, and, erosive, geological, processes, it, is, also, produced, in, large, quantities, commercially, as, crushed, stone, gravel, is, classified, by, particle, size, range, and, includes, size, classes, from, granule, to, boulder, sized, fragments, in, the, udden, wentworth, scale, gravel, is, categorized, into, granular, gravel, 2, 4, mm, or, 0, 079, 0, 157, in, and, pebble, gravel, 4, 64, mm, or, 0, 2, 2, 5, in, iso, 14688, grades, gravels, as, fine, medium, and, coarse, with, ranges, 2, 6, 3, mm, 0, 079, 0, 248, in, for, fine, and, 20, 63, mm, 0, 79, 2, 48, in, for, coarse, one, cubic, metre, of, gravel, typically, weighs, about, 1, 800, kg, 4, 000, lb, or, one, cubic, yard, weighs, about, 3, 000, lb, 1, 400, kg, gravel, is, an, important, commercial, product, with, a, number, of, applications, almost, half, of, all, gravel, production, is, used, as, aggregate, for, concrete, much, of, the, rest, is, used, for, road, construction, either, in, the, road, base, or, as, the, road, surface, with, or, without, asphalt, or, other, binders, naturally, occurring, porous, gravel, deposits, have, a, high, hydraulic, conductivity, making, them, important, aquifers, colloquially, the, term, gravel, is, often, used, to, describe, a, mixture, of, different, size, pieces, of, stone, mixed, with, sand, and, possibly, some, clay, the, american, construction, industry, distinguishes, between, gravel, a, natural, material, and, crushed, stone, produced, artificially, by, mechanical, crushing, of, rock, the, technical, definition, of, gravel, varies, by, region, and, by, area, of, application, many, geologists, define, gravel, simply, as, loose, rounded, rock, particles, over, 2, mm, 0, 079, in, in, diameter, without, specifying, an, upper, size, limit, gravel, is, sometimes, distinguished, from, rubble, which, is, loose, rock, particles, in, the, same, size, range, but, angular, in, shape, the, udden, wentworth, scale, widely, used, by, geologists, in, the, us, defines, granular, gravel, as, particles, with, a, size, from, 2, to, 4, mm, 0, 079, to, 0, 157, in, and, pebble, gravel, as, particles, with, a, size, from, 4, to, 64, mm, 0, 16, to, 2, 52, in, this, corresponds, to, all, particles, with, sizes, between, coarse, sand, and, cobbles, the, u, s, department, of, agriculture, and, the, soil, science, society, of, america, define, gravel, as, particles, from, 2, to, 80, mm, 0, 079, to, 3, 150, in, in, size, while, the, german, scale, atterburg, defines, gravel, as, particles, from, 2, to, 200, mm, 0, 079, to, 7, 874, in, in, size, the, u, s, army, corps, of, engineers, defines, gravel, as, particles, under, 3, in, 76, mm, in, size, that, are, retained, by, a, number, 4, mesh, which, has, a, mesh, spacing, of, 4, 76, mm, 0, 187, in, iso, 14688, for, soil, engineering, grades, gravels, as, fine, medium, and, coarse, with, ranges, 2, mm, to, 6, 3, mm, to, 20, mm, to, 63, mm, the, bulk, density, of, gravel, varies, from, 1, 460, to, 1, 920, kg, m, 3, 2, 460, to, 3, 240, lb, cu, yd, natural, gravel, has, a, high, hydraulic, conductivity, sometimes, reaching, above, 1, cm, s, most, gravel, is, derived, from, disintegration, of, bedrock, as, it, weathers, quartz, is, the, most, common, mineral, found, in, gravel, as, it, is, hard, chemically, inert, and, lacks, cleavage, planes, along, which, the, rock, easily, splits, most, gravel, particles, consist, of, multiple, mineral, grains, since, few, rocks, have, mineral, grains, coarser, than, about, 8, millimeters, 0, 31, in, in, size, exceptions, include, quartz, veins, pegmatites, deep, intrusions, and, high, grade, metamorphic, rock, the, rock, fragments, are, rapidly, rounded, as, they, are, transported, by, rivers, often, within, a, few, tens, of, kilometers, of, their, source, outcrops, gravel, is, deposited, as, gravel, blankets, or, bars, in, stream, channels, in, alluvial, fans, in, near, shore, marine, settings, where, the, gravel, is, supplied, by, streams, or, erosion, along, the, coast, and, in, the, deltas, of, swift, flowing, streams, the, upper, mississippi, embayment, contains, extensive, chert, gravels, thought, to, have, their, origin, less, than, 100, miles, 160, km, from, the, periphery, of, the, embayment, it, has, been, suggested, that, wind, formed, aeolian, gravel, megaripples, in, argentina, have, counterparts, on, the, planet, mars, in, most, cases, gravel, will, be, a, mixture, of, various, larger, rocks, the, most, common, of, which, would, be, basalt, limestone, and, sandstone, the, variation, created, will, largely, be, dictated, by, the, styling, intentions, for, each, project, since, limestone, often, displays, a, brighter, finish, whereas, sandstone, provides, a, more, rustic, appearance, gravel, is, a, major, basic, raw, material, in, construction, sand, is, not, usually, distinguished, from, gravel, in, official, statistics, but, crushed, stone, is, treated, as, a, separate, category, in, 2020, sand, and, gravel, together, made, up, 23, of, all, industrial, mineral, production, in, the, u, s, with, a, total, value, of, about, 12, 6, billion, some, 960, million, tons, of, construction, sand, and, gravel, were, produced, this, greatly, exceeds, production, of, industrial, sand, and, gravel, 68, million, tons, which, is, mostly, sand, rather, than, gravel, it, is, estimated, that, almost, half, of, construction, sand, and, gravel, is, used, as, aggregate, for, concrete, other, important, uses, include, in, road, construction, as, road, base, or, in, blacktop, as, construction, fill, and, in, myriad, minor, uses, gravel, is, widely, and, plentifully, distributed, mostly, as, river, deposits, river, flood, plains, and, glacial, deposits, so, that, environmental, considerations, and, quality, dictate, whether, alternatives, such, as, crushed, stone, are, more, economical, crushed, stone, is, already, displacing, natural, gravel, in, the, eastern, united, states, and, recycled, gravel, is, also, becoming, increasingly, important, the, word, gravel, comes, from, the, old, french, gravele, or, gravelle, different, varieties, of, gravel, are, distinguished, by, their, composition, origin, and, use, cases, types, of, gravel, include, in, locales, where, gravelly, soil, is, predominant, plant, life, is, generally, more, sparse, this, is, due, to, the, inferior, ability, of, gravels, to, retain, moisture, as, well, as, the, corresponding, paucity, of, mineral, nutrients, since, finer, soils, that, contain, such, minerals, are, present, in, smaller, amounts, sediments, containing, over, 30, gravel, that, become, lithified, into, solid, rock, are, termed, conglomerate, conglomerates, are, widely, distributed, in, sedimentary, rock, of, all, ages, but, usually, as, a, minor, component, making, up, less, than, 1, of, all, sedimentary, rock, alluvial, fans, likely, contain, the, largest, accumulations, of, gravel, in, the, geologic, record, these, include, conglomerates, of, the, triassic, basins, of, eastern, north, america, and, the, new, red, sandstone, of, south, devon, media, related, to, gravel, at, wikimedia, commons
