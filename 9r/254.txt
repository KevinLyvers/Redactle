star, clusters, are, large, groups, of, stars, held, together, by, self, gravitation, two, main, types, of, star, clusters, can, be, distinguished, globular, clusters, are, tight, groups, of, ten, thousand, to, millions, of, old, stars, which, are, gravitationally, bound, open, clusters, are, more, loosely, clustered, groups, of, stars, generally, containing, fewer, than, a, few, hundred, members, that, are, often, very, young, as, they, move, through, the, galaxy, over, time, open, clusters, become, disrupted, by, the, gravitational, influence, of, giant, molecular, clouds, even, though, they, are, no, longer, gravitationally, bound, they, will, continue, to, move, in, broadly, the, same, direction, through, space, and, are, then, known, as, stellar, associations, sometimes, referred, to, as, moving, groups, star, clusters, visible, to, the, naked, eye, include, the, pleiades, hyades, and, 47, tucanae, open, clusters, are, very, different, from, globular, clusters, unlike, the, spherically, distributed, globulars, they, are, confined, to, the, galactic, plane, and, are, almost, always, found, within, spiral, arms, they, are, generally, young, objects, up, to, a, few, tens, of, millions, of, years, old, with, a, few, rare, exceptions, as, old, as, a, few, billion, years, such, as, messier, 67, the, closest, and, most, observed, old, open, cluster, for, example, they, form, h, ii, regions, such, as, the, orion, nebula, open, clusters, typically, have, a, few, hundred, members, and, are, located, in, an, area, up, to, 30, light, years, across, being, much, less, densely, populated, than, globular, clusters, they, are, much, less, tightly, gravitationally, bound, and, over, time, are, disrupted, by, the, gravity, of, giant, molecular, clouds, and, other, clusters, close, encounters, between, cluster, members, can, also, result, in, the, ejection, of, stars, a, process, known, as, evaporation, the, most, prominent, open, clusters, are, the, pleiades, and, hyades, in, taurus, the, double, cluster, of, h, chi, persei, can, also, be, prominent, under, dark, skies, open, clusters, are, often, dominated, by, hot, young, blue, stars, because, although, such, stars, are, short, lived, in, stellar, terms, only, lasting, a, few, tens, of, millions, of, years, open, clusters, tend, to, have, dispersed, before, these, stars, die, a, subset, of, open, clusters, constitute, a, binary, or, aggregate, cluster, new, research, indicates, messier, 25, may, constitute, a, ternary, star, cluster, together, with, ngc, 6716, and, collinder, 394, establishing, precise, distances, to, open, clusters, enables, the, calibration, of, the, period, luminosity, relationship, shown, by, cepheids, variable, stars, which, are, then, used, as, standard, candles, cepheids, are, luminous, and, can, be, used, to, establish, both, the, distances, to, remote, galaxies, and, the, expansion, rate, of, the, universe, hubble, constant, indeed, the, open, cluster, ngc, 7790, hosts, three, classical, cepheids, which, are, critical, for, such, efforts, embedded, clusters, are, groups, of, very, young, stars, that, are, partially, or, fully, encased, in, interstellar, dust, or, gas, which, is, often, impervious, to, optical, observations, embedded, clusters, form, in, molecular, clouds, when, the, clouds, begin, to, collapse, and, form, stars, there, is, often, ongoing, star, formation, in, these, clusters, so, embedded, clusters, may, be, home, to, various, types, of, young, stellar, objects, including, protostars, and, pre, main, sequence, stars, an, example, of, an, embedded, cluster, is, the, trapezium, cluster, in, the, orion, nebula, in, ophiuchi, cloud, l1688, core, region, there, is, an, embedded, cluster, the, embedded, cluster, phase, may, last, for, several, million, years, after, which, gas, in, the, cloud, is, depleted, by, star, formation, or, dispersed, through, radiation, pressure, stellar, winds, and, outflows, or, supernova, explosions, in, general, less, than, 30, of, cloud, mass, is, converted, to, stars, before, the, cloud, is, dispersed, but, this, fraction, may, be, higher, in, particularly, dense, parts, of, the, cloud, with, the, loss, of, mass, in, the, cloud, the, energy, of, the, system, is, altered, often, leading, to, the, disruption, of, a, star, cluster, most, young, embedded, clusters, disperse, shortly, after, the, end, of, star, formation, the, open, clusters, found, in, the, galaxy, are, former, embedded, clusters, that, were, able, to, survive, early, cluster, evolution, however, nearly, all, freely, floating, stars, including, the, sun, were, originally, born, into, embedded, clusters, that, disintegrated, globular, clusters, are, roughly, spherical, groupings, of, from, 10, thousand, to, several, million, stars, packed, into, regions, of, from, 10, to, 30, light, years, across, they, commonly, consist, of, very, old, population, ii, stars, just, a, few, hundred, million, years, younger, than, the, universe, itself, which, are, mostly, yellow, and, red, with, masses, less, than, two, solar, masses, such, stars, predominate, within, clusters, because, hotter, and, more, massive, stars, have, exploded, as, supernovae, or, evolved, through, planetary, nebula, phases, to, end, as, white, dwarfs, yet, a, few, rare, blue, stars, exist, in, globulars, thought, to, be, formed, by, stellar, mergers, in, their, dense, inner, regions, these, stars, are, known, as, blue, stragglers, in, the, milky, way, galaxy, globular, clusters, are, distributed, roughly, spherically, in, the, galactic, halo, around, the, galactic, center, orbiting, the, center, in, highly, elliptical, orbits, in, 1917, the, astronomer, harlow, shapley, made, the, first, respectable, estimate, of, the, sun, s, distance, from, the, galactic, center, based, on, the, distribution, of, globular, clusters, until, the, mid, 1990s, globular, clusters, were, the, cause, of, a, great, mystery, in, astronomy, as, theories, of, stellar, evolution, gave, ages, for, the, oldest, members, of, globular, clusters, that, were, greater, than, the, estimated, age, of, the, universe, however, greatly, improved, distance, measurements, to, globular, clusters, using, the, hipparcos, satellite, and, increasingly, accurate, measurements, of, the, hubble, constant, resolved, the, paradox, giving, an, age, for, the, universe, of, about, 13, billion, years, and, an, age, for, the, oldest, stars, of, a, few, hundred, million, years, less, our, galaxy, has, about, 150, globular, clusters, some, of, which, may, have, been, captured, cores, of, small, galaxies, stripped, of, stars, previously, in, their, outer, margins, by, the, tides, of, the, milky, way, as, seems, to, be, the, case, for, the, globular, cluster, m79, some, galaxies, are, much, richer, in, globulars, than, the, milky, way, the, giant, elliptical, galaxy, m87, contains, over, a, thousand, a, few, of, the, brightest, globular, clusters, are, visible, to, the, naked, eye, the, brightest, omega, centauri, was, observed, in, antiquity, and, catalogued, as, a, star, before, the, telescopic, age, the, brightest, globular, cluster, in, the, northern, hemisphere, is, m13, in, the, constellation, of, hercules, super, star, clusters, are, very, large, regions, of, recent, star, formation, and, are, thought, to, be, the, precursors, of, globular, clusters, examples, include, westerlund, 1, in, the, milky, way, in, 2005, astronomers, discovered, a, new, type, of, star, cluster, in, the, andromeda, galaxy, which, is, in, several, ways, very, similar, to, globular, clusters, although, less, dense, no, such, clusters, which, also, known, as, extended, globular, clusters, are, known, in, the, milky, way, the, three, discovered, in, andromeda, galaxy, are, m31wfs, c1, m31wfs, c2, and, m31wfs, c3, these, new, found, star, clusters, contain, hundreds, of, thousands, of, stars, a, similar, number, to, globular, clusters, the, clusters, also, share, other, characteristics, with, globular, clusters, e, g, the, stellar, populations, and, metallicity, what, distinguishes, them, from, the, globular, clusters, is, that, they, are, much, larger, several, hundred, light, years, across, and, hundreds, of, times, less, dense, the, distances, between, the, stars, are, thus, much, greater, the, clusters, have, properties, intermediate, between, globular, clusters, and, dwarf, spheroidal, galaxies, how, these, clusters, are, formed, is, not, yet, known, but, their, formation, might, well, be, related, to, that, of, globular, clusters, why, m31, has, such, clusters, while, the, milky, way, has, not, is, not, yet, known, it, is, also, unknown, if, any, other, galaxy, contains, this, kind, of, clusters, but, it, would, be, very, unlikely, that, m31, is, the, sole, galaxy, with, extended, clusters, another, type, of, cluster, are, faint, fuzzies, which, so, far, have, only, been, found, in, lenticular, galaxies, like, ngc, 1023, and, ngc, 3384, they, are, characterized, by, their, large, size, compared, to, globular, clusters, and, a, ringlike, distribution, around, the, centres, of, their, host, galaxies, as, the, latter, they, seem, to, be, old, objects, star, clusters, are, important, in, many, areas, of, astronomy, the, reason, behind, this, is, that, almost, all, the, stars, in, old, clusters, were, born, at, roughly, the, same, time, various, properties, of, all, the, stars, in, a, cluster, are, a, function, only, of, mass, and, so, stellar, evolution, theories, rely, on, observations, of, open, and, globular, clusters, this, is, primarily, true, for, old, globular, clusters, in, the, case, of, young, age, 1gyr, and, intermediate, age, 1, age, 5, gyr, factors, such, as, age, mass, chemical, compositions, may, also, play, vital, roles, based, on, their, ages, star, clusters, can, reveal, a, lot, of, information, about, their, host, galaxies, for, example, star, clusters, residing, in, the, magellanic, clouds, can, provide, essential, information, about, the, formation, of, the, magellanic, clouds, dwarf, galaxies, this, in, turn, can, help, us, understand, many, astrophysical, processes, happening, in, our, own, milky, way, galaxy, these, clusters, especially, the, young, ones, can, explain, the, star, formation, process, that, might, have, happened, in, our, milky, way, galaxy, clusters, are, also, a, crucial, step, in, determining, the, distance, scale, of, the, universe, a, few, of, the, nearest, clusters, are, close, enough, for, their, distances, to, be, measured, using, parallax, a, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, can, be, plotted, for, these, clusters, which, has, absolute, values, known, on, the, luminosity, axis, then, when, similar, diagram, is, plotted, for, a, cluster, whose, distance, is, not, known, the, position, of, the, main, sequence, can, be, compared, to, that, of, the, first, cluster, and, the, distance, estimated, this, process, is, known, as, main, sequence, fitting, reddening, and, stellar, populations, must, be, accounted, for, when, using, this, method, nearly, all, stars, in, the, galactic, field, including, the, sun, were, initially, born, in, regions, with, embedded, clusters, that, disintegrated, this, means, that, properties, of, stars, and, planetary, systems, may, have, been, affected, by, early, clustered, environments, this, appears, to, be, the, case, for, our, own, solar, system, in, which, chemical, abundances, point, to, the, effects, of, a, supernova, from, a, nearby, star, early, in, our, solar, system, s, history, technically, not, star, clusters, star, clouds, are, large, groups, of, many, stars, within, a, galaxy, spread, over, very, many, light, years, of, space, often, they, contain, star, clusters, within, them, the, stars, appear, closely, packed, but, are, not, usually, part, of, any, structure, within, the, milky, way, star, clouds, show, through, gaps, between, dust, clouds, of, the, great, rift, allowing, deeper, views, along, our, particular, line, of, sight, star, clouds, have, also, been, identified, in, other, nearby, galaxies, examples, of, star, clouds, include, the, large, sagittarius, star, cloud, small, sagittarius, star, cloud, scutum, star, cloud, cygnus, star, cloud, norma, star, cloud, and, ngc, 206, in, the, andromeda, galaxy, in, 1979, the, international, astronomical, union, s, 17th, general, assembly, recommended, that, newly, discovered, star, clusters, open, or, globular, within, the, galaxy, have, designations, following, the, convention, chhmm, ddd, always, beginning, with, the, prefix, c, where, h, m, and, d, represent, the, approximate, coordinates, of, the, cluster, centre, in, hours, and, minutes, of, right, ascension, and, degrees, of, declination, respectively, with, leading, zeros, the, designation, once, assigned, is, not, to, change, even, if, subsequent, measurements, improve, on, the, location, of, the, cluster, centre, the, first, of, such, designations, were, assigned, by, gosta, lynga, in, 1982
