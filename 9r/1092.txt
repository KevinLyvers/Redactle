the, amplitude, of, a, periodic, variable, is, a, measure, of, its, change, in, a, single, period, such, as, time, or, spatial, period, the, amplitude, of, a, non, periodic, signal, is, its, magnitude, compared, with, a, reference, value, there, are, various, definitions, of, amplitude, see, below, which, are, all, functions, of, the, magnitude, of, the, differences, between, the, variable, s, extreme, values, in, older, texts, the, phase, of, a, periodic, function, is, sometimes, called, the, amplitude, for, symmetric, periodic, waves, like, sine, waves, square, waves, or, triangle, waves, peak, amplitude, and, semi, amplitude, are, the, same, in, audio, system, measurements, telecommunications, and, others, where, the, measurand, is, a, signal, that, swings, above, and, below, a, reference, value, but, is, not, sinusoidal, peak, amplitude, is, often, used, if, the, reference, is, zero, this, is, the, maximum, absolute, value, of, the, signal, if, the, reference, is, a, mean, value, dc, component, the, peak, amplitude, is, the, maximum, absolute, value, of, the, difference, from, that, reference, semi, amplitude, means, half, of, the, peak, to, peak, amplitude, the, majority, of, scientific, literature, employs, the, term, amplitude, or, peak, amplitude, to, mean, semi, amplitude, it, is, the, most, widely, used, measure, of, orbital, wobble, in, astronomy, and, the, measurement, of, small, radial, velocity, semi, amplitudes, of, nearby, stars, is, important, in, the, search, for, exoplanets, see, doppler, spectroscopy, in, general, the, use, of, peak, amplitude, is, simple, and, unambiguous, only, for, symmetric, periodic, waves, like, a, sine, wave, a, square, wave, or, a, triangle, wave, for, an, asymmetric, wave, periodic, pulses, in, one, direction, for, example, the, peak, amplitude, becomes, ambiguous, this, is, because, the, value, is, different, depending, on, whether, the, maximum, positive, signal, is, measured, relative, to, the, mean, the, maximum, negative, signal, is, measured, relative, to, the, mean, or, the, maximum, positive, signal, is, measured, relative, to, the, maximum, negative, signal, the, peak, to, peak, amplitude, and, then, divided, by, two, the, semi, amplitude, in, electrical, engineering, the, usual, solution, to, this, ambiguity, is, to, measure, the, amplitude, from, a, defined, reference, potential, such, as, ground, or, 0, v, strictly, speaking, this, is, no, longer, amplitude, since, there, is, the, possibility, that, a, constant, dc, component, is, included, in, the, measurement, peak, to, peak, amplitude, abbreviated, p, p, or, ptp, or, ptop, is, the, change, between, peak, highest, amplitude, value, and, trough, lowest, amplitude, value, which, can, be, negative, with, appropriate, circuitry, peak, to, peak, amplitudes, of, electric, oscillations, can, be, measured, by, meters, or, by, viewing, the, waveform, on, an, oscilloscope, peak, to, peak, is, a, straightforward, measurement, on, an, oscilloscope, the, peaks, of, the, waveform, being, easily, identified, and, measured, against, the, graticule, this, remains, a, common, way, of, specifying, amplitude, but, sometimes, other, measures, of, amplitude, are, more, appropriate, root, mean, square, rms, amplitude, is, used, especially, in, electrical, engineering, the, rms, is, defined, as, the, square, root, of, the, mean, over, time, of, the, square, of, the, vertical, distance, of, the, graph, from, the, rest, state, i, e, the, rms, of, the, ac, waveform, with, no, dc, component, for, complicated, waveforms, especially, non, repeating, signals, like, noise, the, rms, amplitude, is, usually, used, because, it, is, both, unambiguous, and, has, physical, significance, for, example, the, average, power, transmitted, by, an, acoustic, or, electromagnetic, wave, or, by, an, electrical, signal, is, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, rms, amplitude, and, not, in, general, to, the, square, of, the, peak, amplitude, for, alternating, current, electric, power, the, universal, practice, is, to, specify, rms, values, of, a, sinusoidal, waveform, one, property, of, root, mean, square, voltages, and, currents, is, that, they, produce, the, same, heating, effect, as, a, direct, current, in, a, given, resistance, the, peak, to, peak, value, is, used, for, example, when, choosing, rectifiers, for, power, supplies, or, when, estimating, the, maximum, voltage, that, insulation, must, withstand, some, common, voltmeters, are, calibrated, for, rms, amplitude, but, respond, to, the, average, value, of, a, rectified, waveform, many, digital, voltmeters, and, all, moving, coil, meters, are, in, this, category, the, rms, calibration, is, only, correct, for, a, sine, wave, input, since, the, ratio, between, peak, average, and, rms, values, is, dependent, on, waveform, if, the, wave, shape, being, measured, is, greatly, different, from, a, sine, wave, the, relationship, between, rms, and, average, value, changes, true, rms, responding, meters, were, used, in, radio, frequency, measurements, where, instruments, measured, the, heating, effect, in, a, resistor, to, measure, a, current, the, advent, of, microprocessor, controlled, meters, capable, of, calculating, rms, by, sampling, the, waveform, has, made, true, rms, measurement, commonplace, in, telecommunications, pulse, amplitude, is, the, magnitude, of, a, pulse, parameter, such, as, the, voltage, level, current, level, field, intensity, or, power, level, pulse, amplitude, is, measured, with, respect, to, a, specified, reference, and, therefore, should, be, modified, by, qualifiers, such, as, average, instantaneous, peak, or, root, mean, square, pulse, amplitude, also, applies, to, the, amplitude, of, frequency, and, phase, modulated, waveform, envelopes, in, this, simple, wave, equation, the, units, of, the, amplitude, depend, on, the, type, of, wave, but, are, always, in, the, same, units, as, the, oscillating, variable, a, more, general, representation, of, the, wave, equation, is, more, complex, but, the, role, of, amplitude, remains, analogous, to, this, simple, case, for, waves, on, a, string, or, in, a, medium, such, as, water, the, amplitude, is, a, displacement, the, amplitude, of, sound, waves, and, audio, signals, which, relates, to, the, volume, conventionally, refers, to, the, amplitude, of, the, air, pressure, in, the, wave, but, sometimes, the, amplitude, of, the, displacement, movements, of, the, air, or, the, diaphragm, of, a, speaker, is, described, the, logarithm, of, the, amplitude, squared, is, usually, quoted, in, db, so, a, null, amplitude, corresponds, to, db, loudness, is, related, to, amplitude, and, intensity, and, is, one, of, the, most, salient, qualities, of, a, sound, although, in, general, sounds, it, can, be, recognized, independently, of, amplitude, the, square, of, the, amplitude, is, proportional, to, the, intensity, of, the, wave, for, electromagnetic, radiation, the, amplitude, of, a, photon, corresponds, to, the, changes, in, the, electric, field, of, the, wave, however, radio, signals, may, be, carried, by, electromagnetic, radiation, the, intensity, of, the, radiation, amplitude, modulation, or, the, frequency, of, the, radiation, frequency, modulation, is, oscillated, and, then, the, individual, oscillations, are, varied, modulated, to, produce, the, signal, amplitude, envelope, refers, to, the, changes, in, the, amplitude, of, a, sound, over, time, and, is, an, influential, property, as, it, affects, perception, of, timbre, a, flat, tone, has, a, steady, state, amplitude, that, remains, constant, during, time, which, is, represented, by, a, scalar, other, sounds, can, have, percussive, amplitude, envelopes, featuring, an, abrupt, onset, followed, by, an, immediate, exponential, decay, percussive, amplitude, envelopes, are, characteristic, of, various, impact, sounds, two, wine, glasses, clinking, together, hitting, a, drum, slamming, a, door, etc, where, the, amplitude, is, transient, and, must, be, represented, as, either, a, continuous, function, or, a, discrete, vector, percussive, amplitude, envelopes, model, many, common, sounds, that, have, a, transient, loudness, attack, decay, sustain, and, release, with, waveforms, containing, many, overtones, complex, transient, timbres, can, be, achieved, by, assigning, each, overtone, to, its, own, distinct, transient, amplitude, envelope, unfortunately, this, has, the, effect, of, modulating, the, loudness, of, the, sound, as, well, it, makes, more, sense, to, separate, loudness, and, harmonic, quality, to, be, parameters, controlled, independently, of, each, other, to, do, so, harmonic, amplitude, envelopes, are, frame, by, frame, normalized, to, become, amplitude, proportion, envelopes, where, at, each, time, frame, all, the, harmonic, amplitudes, will, add, to, 100, or, 1, this, way, the, main, loudness, controlling, envelope, can, be, cleanly, controlled, in, sound, recognition, max, amplitude, normalization, can, be, used, to, help, align, the, key, harmonic, features, of, 2, alike, sounds, allowing, similar, timbres, to, be, recognized, independent, of, loudness
