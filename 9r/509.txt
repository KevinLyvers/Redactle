polyester, is, a, category, of, polymers, that, contain, one, or, two, ester, linkages, in, every, repeat, unit, of, their, main, chain, as, a, specific, material, it, most, commonly, refers, to, a, type, called, polyethylene, terephthalate, pet, polyesters, include, naturally, occurring, chemicals, such, as, in, plants, and, insects, as, well, as, synthetics, such, as, polybutyrate, natural, polyesters, and, a, few, synthetic, ones, are, biodegradable, but, most, synthetic, polyesters, are, not, synthetic, polyesters, are, used, extensively, in, clothing, polyester, fibers, are, sometimes, spun, together, with, natural, fibers, to, produce, a, cloth, with, blended, properties, cotton, polyester, blends, can, be, strong, wrinkle, and, tear, resistant, and, reduce, shrinking, synthetic, fibers, using, polyester, have, high, water, wind, and, environmental, resistance, compared, to, plant, derived, fibers, they, are, less, fire, resistant, and, can, melt, when, ignited, liquid, crystalline, polyesters, are, among, the, first, industrially, used, liquid, crystal, polymers, they, are, used, for, their, mechanical, properties, and, heat, resistance, these, traits, are, also, important, in, their, application, as, an, abradable, seal, in, jet, engines, polyesters, can, contain, one, ester, linkage, per, repeat, unit, of, the, polymer, as, in, polyhydroxyalkanoates, like, polylactic, acid, or, they, may, have, two, ester, linkages, per, repeat, unit, as, in, polyethylene, terephthalate, pet, polyesters, are, one, of, the, most, economically, important, classes, of, polymers, driven, especially, by, pet, which, is, counted, among, the, commodity, plastics, in, 2019, around, 30, 5, million, metric, tons, were, produced, worldwide, there, is, a, great, variety, of, structures, and, properties, in, the, polyester, family, based, on, the, varying, nature, of, the, r, group, see, first, figure, with, blue, ester, group, polyesters, occurring, in, nature, include, the, cutin, component, of, plant, cuticles, which, consists, of, omega, hydroxy, acids, and, their, derivatives, interlinked, via, ester, bonds, forming, polyester, polymers, of, indeterminate, size, polyesters, are, also, produced, by, bees, in, the, genus, colletes, which, secrete, a, cellophane, like, polyester, lining, for, their, underground, brood, cells, earning, them, the, nickname, polyester, bees, the, family, of, synthetic, polyesters, comprises, depending, on, the, chemical, structure, polyester, can, be, a, thermoplastic, or, thermoset, there, are, also, polyester, resins, cured, by, hardeners, however, the, most, common, polyesters, are, thermoplastics, the, oh, group, is, reacted, with, an, isocyanate, functional, compound, in, a, 2, component, system, producing, coatings, which, may, optionally, be, pigmented, polyesters, as, thermoplastics, may, change, shape, after, the, application, of, heat, while, combustible, at, high, temperatures, polyesters, tend, to, shrink, away, from, flames, and, self, extinguish, upon, ignition, polyester, fibers, have, high, tenacity, and, e, modulus, as, well, as, low, water, absorption, and, minimal, shrinkage, in, comparison, with, other, industrial, fibers, increasing, the, aromatic, parts, of, polyesters, increases, their, glass, transition, temperature, melting, temperature, thermostability, chemical, stability, and, solvent, resistance, polyesters, can, also, be, telechelic, oligomers, like, the, polycaprolactone, diol, pcl, and, the, polyethylene, adipate, diol, pea, they, are, then, used, as, prepolymers, thermally, stable, polymers, which, generally, have, a, high, proportion, of, aromatic, structures, are, also, called, high, performance, plastics, this, application, oriented, classification, compares, such, polymers, with, engineering, plastics, and, commodity, plastics, the, continuous, service, temperature, of, high, performance, plastics, is, generally, stated, as, being, higher, than, 150, c, whereas, engineering, plastics, such, as, polyamide, or, polycarbonate, are, often, defined, as, thermoplastics, that, retain, their, properties, above, 100, c, commodity, plastics, such, as, polyethylene, or, polypropylene, have, in, this, respect, even, greater, limitations, but, they, are, manufactured, in, great, amounts, at, low, cost, poly, ester, imides, contain, an, aromatic, imide, group, in, the, repeat, unit, the, imide, based, polymers, have, a, high, proportion, of, aromatic, structures, in, the, main, chain, and, belong, to, the, class, of, thermally, stable, polymers, such, polymers, contain, structures, that, impart, high, melting, temperatures, resistance, to, oxidative, degradation, and, stability, to, radiation, and, chemical, reagents, among, the, thermally, stable, polymers, with, commercial, relevance, are, polyimides, polysulfones, polyetherketones, and, polybenzimidazoles, of, these, polyimides, are, most, widely, applied, the, polymers, structures, result, also, in, poor, processing, characteristics, in, particular, a, high, melting, point, and, low, solubility, the, named, properties, are, in, particular, based, on, a, high, percentage, of, aromatic, carbons, in, the, polymer, backbone, which, produces, a, certain, stiffness, approaches, for, an, improvement, of, processability, include, the, incorporation, of, flexible, spacers, into, the, backbone, the, attachment, of, stable, pendent, groups, or, the, incorporation, of, non, symmetrical, structures, flexible, spacers, include, for, example, ether, or, hexafluoroisopropylidene, carbonyl, or, aliphatic, groups, like, isopropylidene, these, groups, allow, bond, rotation, between, aromatic, rings, less, symmetrical, structures, for, example, based, on, meta, or, ortho, linked, monomers, introduce, structural, disorder, decreasing, the, crystallinity, the, generally, poor, processability, of, aromatic, polymers, for, example, a, high, melting, point, and, a, low, solubility, also, limits, the, available, options, for, synthesis, and, may, require, strong, electron, donating, co, solvents, like, hfip, or, tfa, for, analysis, e, g, 1, h, nmr, spectroscopy, which, themselves, can, introduce, further, practical, limitations, fabrics, woven, or, knitted, from, polyester, thread, or, yarn, are, used, extensively, in, apparel, and, home, furnishings, from, shirts, and, pants, to, jackets, and, hats, bed, sheets, blankets, upholstered, furniture, and, computer, mouse, mats, industrial, polyester, fibers, yarns, and, ropes, are, used, in, car, tire, reinforcements, fabrics, for, conveyor, belts, safety, belts, coated, fabrics, and, plastic, reinforcements, with, high, energy, absorption, polyester, fiber, is, used, as, cushioning, and, insulating, material, in, pillows, comforters, stuffed, animals, and, characters, and, upholstery, padding, polyester, fabrics, are, highly, stain, resistant, since, polyester, is, a, hydrophobic, material, making, it, hard, to, absorb, liquids, the, only, class, of, dyes, which, can, be, used, to, alter, the, color, of, polyester, fabric, are, what, are, known, as, disperse, dyes, polyesters, are, also, used, to, make, bottles, films, tarpaulin, sails, dacron, canoes, liquid, crystal, displays, holograms, filters, dielectric, film, for, capacitors, film, insulation, for, wire, and, insulating, tapes, polyesters, are, widely, used, as, a, finish, on, high, quality, wood, products, such, as, guitars, pianos, and, vehicle, yacht, interiors, thixotropic, properties, of, spray, applicable, polyesters, make, them, ideal, for, use, on, open, grain, timbers, as, they, can, quickly, fill, wood, grain, with, a, high, build, film, thickness, per, coat, it, can, be, used, for, fashionable, dresses, but, it, is, most, admired, for, its, ability, to, resist, wrinkling, and, shrinking, while, washing, the, product, its, toughness, makes, it, a, frequent, choice, for, children, s, wear, polyester, is, often, blended, with, other, fibres, like, cotton, to, get, the, desirable, properties, of, both, materials, cured, polyesters, can, be, sanded, and, polished, to, a, high, gloss, durable, finish, polyester, is, typically, produced, through, a, process, known, as, polymerization, for, polyethylene, terephthalate, pet, the, production, process, involves, the, chemical, reaction, between, two, primary, raw, materials, purified, terephthalic, acid, pta, or, dimethyl, terephthalate, dmt, and, monoethylene, glycol, meg, the, production, process, includes, the, following, steps, polyethylene, terephthalate, the, polyester, with, the, greatest, market, share, is, a, synthetic, polymer, made, of, purified, terephthalic, acid, pta, or, its, dimethyl, ester, dimethyl, terephthalate, dmt, and, monoethylene, glycol, meg, with, 18, market, share, of, all, plastic, materials, produced, it, ranges, third, after, polyethylene, 33, 5, and, polypropylene, 19, 5, and, is, counted, as, commodity, plastic, there, are, several, reasons, for, the, importance, of, polyethylene, terephthalate, in, the, following, table, the, estimated, world, polyester, production, is, shown, main, applications, are, textile, polyester, bottle, polyester, resin, film, polyester, mainly, for, packaging, and, specialty, polyesters, for, engineering, plastics, after, the, first, stage, of, polymer, production, in, the, melt, phase, the, product, stream, divides, into, two, different, application, areas, which, are, mainly, textile, applications, and, packaging, applications, in, the, following, table, the, main, applications, of, textile, and, packaging, of, polyester, are, listed, abbreviations, a, comparable, small, market, segment, much, less, than, 1, million, tonnes, year, of, polyester, is, used, to, produce, engineering, plastics, and, masterbatch, in, order, to, produce, the, polyester, melt, with, a, high, efficiency, high, output, processing, steps, like, staple, fiber, 50, 300, tonnes, day, per, spinning, line, or, poy, fdy, up, to, 600, tonnes, day, split, into, about, 10, spinning, machines, are, meanwhile, more, and, more, vertically, integrated, direct, processes, this, means, the, polymer, melt, is, directly, converted, into, the, textile, fibers, or, filaments, without, the, common, step, of, pelletizing, we, are, talking, about, full, vertical, integration, when, polyester, is, produced, at, one, site, starting, from, crude, oil, or, distillation, products, in, the, chain, oil, benzene, px, pta, pet, melt, fiber, filament, or, bottle, grade, resin, such, integrated, processes, are, meanwhile, established, in, more, or, less, interrupted, processes, at, one, production, site, eastman, chemicals, were, the, first, to, introduce, the, idea, of, closing, the, chain, from, px, to, pet, resin, with, their, so, called, integrex, process, the, capacity, of, such, vertically, integrated, production, sites, is, 1000, tonnes, day, and, can, easily, reach, 2500, tonnes, day, besides, the, above, mentioned, large, processing, units, to, produce, staple, fiber, or, yarns, there, are, ten, thousands, of, small, and, very, small, processing, plants, so, that, one, can, estimate, that, polyester, is, processed, and, recycled, in, more, than, 10, 000, plants, around, the, globe, this, is, without, counting, all, the, companies, involved, in, the, supply, industry, beginning, with, engineering, and, processing, machines, and, ending, with, special, additives, stabilizers, and, colors, this, is, a, gigantic, industry, complex, and, it, is, still, growing, by, 4, 8, per, year, depending, on, the, world, region, synthesis, of, polyesters, is, generally, achieved, by, a, polycondensation, reaction, the, general, equation, for, the, reaction, of, a, diol, with, a, diacid, is, polyesters, can, be, obtained, by, a, wide, range, of, reactions, of, which, the, most, important, are, the, reaction, of, acids, and, alcohols, alcoholysis, and, or, acidolysis, of, low, molecular, weight, esters, or, the, alcoholysis, of, acyl, chlorides, the, following, figure, gives, an, overview, over, such, typical, polycondensation, reactions, for, polyester, production, furthermore, polyesters, are, accessible, via, ring, opening, polymerization, azeotrope, esterification, is, a, classical, method, for, condensation, the, water, formed, by, the, reaction, of, alcohol, and, a, carboxylic, acid, is, continually, removed, by, azeotropic, distillation, when, melting, points, of, the, monomers, are, sufficiently, low, a, polyester, can, be, formed, via, direct, esterification, while, removing, the, reaction, water, via, vacuum, direct, bulk, polyesterification, at, high, temperatures, 150, 290, c, is, well, suited, and, used, on, the, industrial, scale, for, the, production, of, aliphatic, unsaturated, and, aromatic, aliphatic, polyesters, monomers, containing, phenolic, or, tertiary, hydroxyl, groups, exhibit, a, low, reactivity, with, carboxylic, acids, and, cannot, be, polymerized, via, direct, acid, alcohol, based, polyesterification, in, the, case, of, pet, production, however, the, direct, process, has, several, advantages, in, particular, a, higher, reaction, rate, a, higher, attainable, molecular, weight, the, release, of, water, instead, of, methanol, and, lower, storage, costs, of, the, acid, when, compared, to, the, ester, due, to, the, lower, weight, transesterification, an, alcohol, terminated, oligomer, and, an, ester, terminated, oligomer, condense, to, form, an, ester, linkage, with, loss, of, an, alcohol, r, and, r, are, the, two, oligomer, chains, r, is, a, sacrificial, unit, such, as, a, methyl, group, methanol, is, the, byproduct, of, the, esterification, reaction, the, term, transesterification, is, typically, used, to, describe, hydroxy, ester, carboxy, ester, and, ester, ester, exchange, reactions, the, hydroxy, ester, exchange, reaction, possesses, the, highest, rate, of, reaction, and, is, used, for, the, production, of, numerous, aromatic, aliphatic, and, wholly, aromatic, polyesters, the, transesterification, based, synthesis, is, particularly, useful, for, when, high, melting, and, poorly, soluble, dicarboxylic, acids, are, used, in, addition, alcohols, as, condensation, product, are, more, volatile, and, thereby, easier, to, remove, than, water, the, high, temperature, melt, synthesis, between, bisphenol, diacetates, and, aromatic, dicarboxylic, acids, or, in, reverse, between, bisphenols, and, aromatic, dicarboxylic, acid, diphenyl, esters, carried, out, at, 220, to, 320, c, upon, the, release, of, acetic, acid, is, besides, the, acyl, chloride, based, synthesis, the, preferred, route, to, wholly, aromatic, polyesters, in, acylation, the, acid, begins, as, an, acyl, chloride, and, thus, the, polycondensation, proceeds, with, emission, of, hydrochloric, acid, hcl, instead, of, water, the, reaction, between, diacyl, chlorides, and, alcohols, or, phenolic, compounds, has, been, widely, applied, to, polyester, synthesis, and, has, been, subject, of, numerous, reviews, and, book, chapters, the, reaction, is, carried, out, at, lower, temperatures, than, the, equilibrium, methods, possible, types, are, the, high, temperature, solution, condensation, amine, catalysed, and, interfacial, reactions, in, addition, the, use, of, activating, agents, is, counted, as, non, equilibrium, method, the, equilibrium, constants, for, the, acyl, chloride, based, condensation, yielding, yielding, arylates, and, polyarylates, are, very, high, indeed, and, are, reported, to, be, 4, 3, 10, 3, and, 4, 7, 10, 3, respectively, this, reaction, is, thus, often, referred, to, as, a, non, equilibrium, polyesterification, even, though, the, acyl, chloride, based, synthesis, is, also, subject, of, reports, in, the, patent, literature, it, is, unlikely, that, the, reaction, is, utilized, on, the, production, scale, the, method, is, limited, by, the, acid, dichlorides, high, cost, its, sensitivity, to, hydrolysis, and, the, occurrence, of, side, reactions, the, high, temperature, reaction, 100, to, 300, c, of, an, diacyl, chloride, with, an, dialcohol, yields, the, polyester, and, hydrogen, chloride, under, these, relatively, high, temperatures, the, reaction, proceeds, rapidly, without, a, catalyst, the, conversion, of, the, reaction, can, be, followed, by, titration, of, the, evolved, hydrogen, chloride, a, wide, variety, of, solvents, has, been, described, including, chlorinated, benzenes, e, g, dichlorobenzene, chlorinated, naphthalenes, or, diphenyls, as, well, as, non, chlorinated, aromatics, like, terphenyls, benzophenones, or, dibenzylbenzenes, the, reaction, was, also, applied, successfully, to, the, preparation, of, highly, crystalline, and, poorly, soluble, polymers, which, require, high, temperatures, to, be, kept, in, solution, at, least, until, a, sufficiently, high, molecular, weight, was, achieved, in, an, interfacial, acyl, chloride, based, reaction, the, alcohol, generally, in, fact, a, phenol, is, dissolved, in, the, form, of, an, alkoxide, in, an, aqueous, sodium, hydroxide, solution, the, acyl, chloride, in, an, organic, solvent, immiscible, with, water, such, as, dichloromethane, chlorobenzene, or, hexane, the, reaction, occurs, at, the, interface, under, high, speed, agitation, near, room, temperature, the, procedure, is, used, for, the, production, of, polyarylates, polyesters, based, on, bisphenols, polyamides, polycarbonates, poly, thiocarbonate, s, and, others, since, the, molecular, weight, of, the, product, obtained, by, a, high, temperature, synthesis, can, be, seriously, limited, by, side, reactions, this, problem, is, circumvented, by, the, mild, temperatures, of, interfacial, polycondensation, the, procedure, is, applied, to, the, commercial, production, of, bisphenol, a, based, polyarylates, like, unitika, s, u, polymer, water, could, be, in, some, cases, replaced, by, an, immiscible, organic, solvent, e, g, in, the, adiponitrile, carbon, tetrachloride, system, the, procedure, is, of, little, use, in, the, production, of, polyesters, based, on, aliphatic, diols, which, have, higher, p, k, a, values, than, phenols, and, therefore, do, not, form, alcoholate, ions, in, aqueous, solutions, the, base, catalysed, reaction, of, an, acyl, chloride, with, an, alcohol, may, also, be, carried, out, in, one, phase, using, tertiary, amines, e, g, triethylamine, et, 3, n, or, pyridine, as, acid, acceptors, while, acyl, chloride, based, polyesterifications, proceed, only, very, slowly, at, room, temperature, without, a, catalyst, the, amine, accelerates, the, reaction, in, several, possible, ways, although, the, mechanism, is, not, fully, understood, however, it, is, known, that, tertiary, amines, can, cause, side, reactions, such, as, the, formation, of, ketenes, and, ketene, dimers, aliphatic, polyesters, can, be, assembled, from, lactones, under, very, mild, conditions, catalyzed, anionically, cationically, metallorganically, or, enzyme, based, a, number, of, catalytic, methods, for, the, copolymerization, of, epoxides, with, cyclic, anhydrides, have, also, recently, been, shown, to, provide, a, wide, array, of, functionalized, polyesters, both, saturated, and, unsaturated, ring, opening, polymerization, of, lactones, and, lactides, is, also, applied, on, the, industrial, scale, numerous, other, reactions, have, been, reported, for, the, synthesis, of, selected, polyesters, but, are, limited, to, laboratory, scale, syntheses, using, specific, conditions, for, example, using, dicarboxylic, acid, salts, and, dialkyl, halides, or, reactions, between, bisketenes, and, diols, instead, of, acyl, chlorides, so, called, activating, agents, can, be, used, such, as, 1, 1, carbonyldiimidazole, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, or, trifluoroacetic, anhydride, the, polycondensation, proceeds, via, the, in, situ, conversion, of, the, carboxylic, acid, into, a, more, reactive, intermediate, while, the, activating, agents, are, consumed, the, reaction, proceeds, for, example, via, an, intermediate, n, acylimidazole, which, reacts, with, catalytically, acting, sodium, alkoxide, the, use, of, activating, agents, for, the, production, of, high, melting, aromatic, polyesters, and, polyamides, under, mild, conditions, has, been, subject, of, intensive, academic, research, since, the, 1980s, but, the, reactions, have, not, gained, commercial, acceptance, as, similar, results, can, be, achieved, with, cheaper, reactants, polyesterifications, are, grouped, by, some, authors, into, two, main, categories, a, equilibrium, polyesterifications, mainly, alcohol, acid, reaction, alcohol, ester, and, acid, ester, interchange, reactions, carried, out, in, bulk, at, high, temperatures, and, b, non, equilibrium, polyesterifications, using, highly, reactive, monomers, for, example, acid, chlorides, or, activated, carboxylic, acids, mostly, carried, out, at, lower, temperatures, in, solution, the, acid, alcohol, based, polyesterification, is, one, example, of, an, equilibrium, reaction, the, ratio, between, the, polymer, forming, ester, group, c, o, o, and, the, condensation, product, water, h, 2, o, against, the, acid, based, c, o, oh, and, alcohol, based, oh, monomers, is, described, by, the, equilibrium, constant, k, c, k, c, c, o, o, h, 2, o, c, o, oh, oh, displaystyle, k, c, frac, the, equilibrium, constant, of, the, acid, alcohol, based, polyesterification, is, typically, k, c, 10, what, is, not, high, enough, to, obtain, high, molecular, weight, polymers, dp, n, 100, as, the, number, average, degree, of, polymerization, dp, n, can, be, calculated, from, the, equilibrium, constant, k, c, d, p, n, k, c, 2, 1, displaystyle, dp, n, sqrt, k, c, 1, in, equilibrium, reactions, it, is, therefore, necessary, to, remove, the, condensation, product, continuously, and, efficiently, from, the, reaction, medium, in, order, to, drive, the, equilibrium, towards, polymer, the, condensation, product, is, therefore, removed, at, reduced, pressure, and, high, temperatures, 150, 320, c, depending, on, the, monomers, to, prevent, the, back, reaction, with, the, progress, of, the, reaction, the, concentration, of, active, chain, ends, is, decreasing, and, the, viscosity, of, the, melt, or, solution, increasing, for, an, increase, of, the, reaction, rate, the, reaction, is, carried, out, at, high, end, group, concentration, preferably, in, the, bulk, promoted, by, the, elevated, temperatures, equilibrium, constants, of, magnitude, k, c, 10, 4, are, achieved, when, using, reactive, reactants, acid, chlorides, or, acid, anhydrides, or, activating, agents, like, 1, 1, carbonyldiimidazole, using, these, reactants, molecular, weights, required, for, technical, applications, can, be, achieved, even, without, active, removal, of, the, condensation, product, in, 1926, united, states, based, dupont, began, research, on, large, molecules, and, synthetic, fibers, this, early, research, headed, by, wallace, carothers, centered, on, what, became, nylon, which, was, one, of, the, first, synthetic, fibers, carothers, was, working, for, dupont, at, the, time, carothers, research, was, incomplete, and, had, not, advanced, to, investigating, the, polyester, formed, from, mixing, ethylene, glycol, and, terephthalic, acid, in, 1928, polyester, was, patented, in, britain, by, the, international, general, electric, company, carothers, project, was, revived, by, british, scientists, whinfield, and, dickson, who, patented, polyethylene, terephthalate, pet, or, pete, in, 1941, polyethylene, terephthalate, forms, the, basis, for, synthetic, fibers, like, dacron, terylene, and, polyester, in, 1946, dupont, bought, all, legal, rights, from, imperial, chemical, industries, ici, the, futuro, houses, were, made, of, fibreglass, reinforced, polyester, plastic, polyester, polyurethane, and, poly, methyl, methacrylate, one, house, was, found, to, be, degrading, by, cyanobacteria, and, archaea, unsaturated, polyesters, are, thermosetting, polymers, they, are, generally, copolymers, prepared, by, polymerizing, one, or, more, diols, with, saturated, and, unsaturated, dicarboxylic, acids, maleic, acid, fumaric, acid, etc, or, their, anhydrides, the, double, bond, of, unsaturated, polyesters, reacts, with, a, vinyl, monomer, usually, styrene, resulting, in, a, 3, d, cross, linked, structure, this, structure, acts, as, a, thermoset, the, exothermic, cross, linking, reaction, is, initiated, through, a, catalyst, usually, an, organic, peroxide, such, as, methyl, ethyl, ketone, peroxide, or, benzoyl, peroxide, a, team, at, plymouth, university, in, the, uk, spent, 12, months, analysing, what, happened, when, a, number, of, synthetic, materials, were, washed, at, different, temperatures, in, domestic, washing, machines, using, different, combinations, of, detergents, to, quantify, the, microfibres, shed, they, found, that, an, average, washing, load, of, 6, kg, could, release, an, estimated, 137, 951, fibres, from, polyester, cotton, blend, fabric, 496, 030, fibres, from, polyester, and, 728, 789, from, acrylic, those, fibers, add, to, the, general, microplastics, pollution, ahmed, shafik, was, a, sexologist, who, won, a, ig, nobel, prize, on, his, research, regarding, how, polyester, can, affect, the, fertility, of, rats, dogs, and, men, bisphenol, a, which, is, a, endocrine, disrupting, chemical, may, be, used, in, the, synthesis, of, polyester, recycling, of, polymers, has, become, very, important, as, the, production, and, use, of, plastic, is, continuously, rising, global, plastic, waste, may, almost, triple, by, 2060, if, this, continues, plastics, can, be, recycled, by, various, means, like, mechanical, recycling, chemical, recycling, etc, among, the, recyclable, polymers, polyester, pet, is, one, of, the, most, recycled, plastics, the, ester, bond, present, in, polyesters, is, susceptible, to, hydrolysis, acidic, or, basic, conditions, methanolysis, and, glycolysis, which, makes, this, class, of, polymers, suitable, for, chemical, recycling, enzymatic, biological, recycling, of, pet, can, be, carried, out, using, different, enzymes, like, petase, cutinase, esterase, lipase, etc, petase, has, been, also, reported, for, enzymatic, degradation, of, other, synthetic, polyesters, pbt, pht, akestra, etc, which, contains, similar, aromatic, ester, bond, as, that, of, pet
