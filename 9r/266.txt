a, white, dwarf, is, a, stellar, core, remnant, composed, mostly, of, electron, degenerate, matter, a, white, dwarf, is, very, dense, its, mass, is, comparable, to, the, sun, s, while, its, volume, is, comparable, to, earth, s, a, white, dwarf, s, low, luminosity, comes, from, the, emission, of, residual, thermal, energy, no, fusion, takes, place, in, a, white, dwarf, the, nearest, known, white, dwarf, is, sirius, b, at, 8, 6, light, years, the, smaller, component, of, the, sirius, binary, star, there, are, currently, thought, to, be, eight, white, dwarfs, among, the, hundred, star, systems, nearest, the, sun, the, unusual, faintness, of, white, dwarfs, was, first, recognized, in, 1910, 1, the, name, white, dwarf, was, coined, by, willem, jacob, luyten, in, 1922, white, dwarfs, are, thought, to, be, the, final, evolutionary, state, of, stars, whose, mass, is, not, high, enough, to, become, a, neutron, star, or, black, hole, this, includes, over, 97, of, the, stars, in, the, milky, way, 1, after, the, hydrogen, fusing, period, of, a, main, sequence, star, of, low, or, medium, mass, ends, such, a, star, will, expand, to, a, red, giant, during, which, it, fuses, helium, to, carbon, and, oxygen, in, its, core, by, the, triple, alpha, process, if, a, red, giant, has, insufficient, mass, to, generate, the, core, temperatures, required, to, fuse, carbon, around, 1, billion, k, an, inert, mass, of, carbon, and, oxygen, will, build, up, at, its, center, after, such, a, star, sheds, its, outer, layers, and, forms, a, planetary, nebula, it, will, leave, behind, a, core, which, is, the, remnant, white, dwarf, usually, white, dwarfs, are, composed, of, carbon, and, oxygen, co, white, dwarf, if, the, mass, of, the, progenitor, is, between, 7, and, 9, solar, masses, m, the, core, temperature, will, be, sufficient, to, fuse, carbon, but, not, neon, in, which, case, an, oxygen, neon, magnesium, onemg, or, one, white, dwarf, may, form, stars, of, very, low, mass, will, be, unable, to, fuse, helium, hence, a, helium, white, dwarf, may, form, by, mass, loss, in, binary, systems, the, material, in, a, white, dwarf, no, longer, undergoes, fusion, reactions, so, the, star, has, no, source, of, energy, as, a, result, it, cannot, support, itself, by, the, heat, generated, by, fusion, against, gravitational, collapse, but, is, supported, only, by, electron, degeneracy, pressure, causing, it, to, be, extremely, dense, the, physics, of, degeneracy, yields, a, maximum, mass, for, a, non, rotating, white, dwarf, the, chandrasekhar, limit, approximately, 1, 44, times, m, beyond, which, it, cannot, be, supported, by, electron, degeneracy, pressure, a, carbon, oxygen, white, dwarf, that, approaches, this, mass, limit, typically, by, mass, transfer, from, a, companion, star, may, explode, as, a, type, ia, supernova, via, a, process, known, as, carbon, detonation, sn, 1006, is, thought, to, be, a, famous, example, a, white, dwarf, is, very, hot, when, it, forms, but, because, it, has, no, source, of, energy, it, will, gradually, cool, as, it, radiates, its, energy, away, this, means, that, its, radiation, which, initially, has, a, high, color, temperature, will, lessen, and, redden, with, time, over, a, very, long, time, a, white, dwarf, will, cool, and, its, material, will, begin, to, crystallize, starting, with, the, core, the, star, s, low, temperature, means, it, will, no, longer, emit, significant, heat, or, light, and, it, will, become, a, cold, black, dwarf, because, the, length, of, time, it, takes, for, a, white, dwarf, to, reach, this, state, is, calculated, to, be, longer, than, the, current, age, of, the, known, universe, approximately, 13, 8, billion, years, it, is, thought, that, no, black, dwarfs, yet, exist, the, oldest, known, white, dwarfs, still, radiate, at, temperatures, of, a, few, thousand, kelvins, which, establishes, an, observational, limit, on, the, maximum, possible, age, of, the, universe, the, first, white, dwarf, discovered, was, in, the, triple, star, system, of, 40, eridani, which, contains, the, relatively, bright, main, sequence, star, 40, eridani, a, orbited, at, a, distance, by, the, closer, binary, system, of, the, white, dwarf, 40, eridani, b, and, the, main, sequence, red, dwarf, 40, eridani, c, the, pair, 40, eridani, b, c, was, discovered, by, william, herschel, on, 31, january, 1783, in, 1910, henry, norris, russell, edward, charles, pickering, and, williamina, fleming, discovered, that, despite, being, a, dim, star, 40, eridani, b, was, of, spectral, type, a, or, white, in, 1939, russell, looked, back, on, the, discovery, 1, i, was, visiting, my, friend, and, generous, benefactor, prof, edward, c, pickering, with, characteristic, kindness, he, had, volunteered, to, have, the, spectra, observed, for, all, the, stars, including, comparison, stars, which, had, been, observed, in, the, observations, for, stellar, parallax, which, hinks, and, i, made, at, cambridge, and, i, discussed, this, piece, of, apparently, routine, work, proved, very, fruitful, it, led, to, the, discovery, that, all, the, stars, of, very, faint, absolute, magnitude, were, of, spectral, class, m, in, conversation, on, this, subject, as, i, recall, it, i, asked, pickering, about, certain, other, faint, stars, not, on, my, list, mentioning, in, particular, 40, eridani, b, characteristically, he, sent, a, note, to, the, observatory, office, and, before, long, the, answer, came, i, think, from, mrs, fleming, that, the, spectrum, of, this, star, was, a, i, knew, enough, about, it, even, in, these, paleozoic, days, to, realize, at, once, that, there, was, an, extreme, inconsistency, between, what, we, would, then, have, called, possible, values, of, the, surface, brightness, and, density, i, must, have, shown, that, i, was, not, only, puzzled, but, crestfallen, at, this, exception, to, what, looked, like, a, very, pretty, rule, of, stellar, characteristics, but, pickering, smiled, upon, me, and, said, it, is, just, these, exceptions, that, lead, to, an, advance, in, our, knowledge, and, so, the, white, dwarfs, entered, the, realm, of, study, the, spectral, type, of, 40, eridani, b, was, officially, described, in, 1914, by, walter, adams, the, white, dwarf, companion, of, sirius, sirius, b, was, next, to, be, discovered, during, the, nineteenth, century, positional, measurements, of, some, stars, became, precise, enough, to, measure, small, changes, in, their, location, friedrich, bessel, used, position, measurements, to, determine, that, the, stars, sirius, canis, majoris, and, procyon, canis, minoris, were, changing, their, positions, periodically, in, 1844, he, predicted, that, both, stars, had, unseen, companions, if, we, were, to, regard, sirius, and, procyon, as, double, stars, the, change, of, their, motions, would, not, surprise, us, we, should, acknowledge, them, as, necessary, and, have, only, to, investigate, their, amount, by, observation, but, light, is, no, real, property, of, mass, the, existence, of, numberless, visible, stars, can, prove, nothing, against, the, existence, of, numberless, invisible, ones, bessel, roughly, estimated, the, period, of, the, companion, of, sirius, to, be, about, half, a, century, c, a, f, peters, computed, an, orbit, for, it, in, 1851, it, was, not, until, 31, january, 1862, that, alvan, graham, clark, observed, a, previously, unseen, star, close, to, sirius, later, identified, as, the, predicted, companion, walter, adams, announced, in, 1915, that, he, had, found, the, spectrum, of, sirius, b, to, be, similar, to, that, of, sirius, in, 1917, adriaan, van, maanen, discovered, van, maanen, s, star, an, isolated, white, dwarf, these, three, white, dwarfs, the, first, discovered, are, the, so, called, classical, white, dwarfs, 2, eventually, many, faint, white, stars, were, found, which, had, high, proper, motion, indicating, that, they, could, be, suspected, to, be, low, luminosity, stars, close, to, the, earth, and, hence, white, dwarfs, willem, luyten, appears, to, have, been, the, first, to, use, the, term, white, dwarf, when, he, examined, this, class, of, stars, in, 1922, the, term, was, later, popularized, by, arthur, eddington, despite, these, suspicions, the, first, non, classical, white, dwarf, was, not, definitely, identified, until, the, 1930s, 18, white, dwarfs, had, been, discovered, by, 1939, 3, luyten, and, others, continued, to, search, for, white, dwarfs, in, the, 1940s, by, 1950, over, a, hundred, were, known, and, by, 1999, over, 2, 000, were, known, since, then, the, sloan, digital, sky, survey, has, found, over, 9, 000, white, dwarfs, mostly, new, although, white, dwarfs, are, known, with, estimated, masses, as, low, as, 0, 17, m, and, as, high, as, 1, 33, m, the, mass, distribution, is, strongly, peaked, at, 0, 6, m, and, the, majority, lie, between, 0, 5, and, 0, 7, m, the, estimated, radii, of, observed, white, dwarfs, are, typically, 0, 8, 2, the, radius, of, the, sun, this, is, comparable, to, the, earth, s, radius, of, approximately, 0, 9, solar, radius, a, white, dwarf, then, packs, mass, comparable, to, the, sun, s, into, a, volume, that, is, typically, a, million, times, smaller, than, the, sun, s, the, average, density, of, matter, in, a, white, dwarf, must, therefore, be, very, roughly, 1, 000, 000, times, greater, than, the, average, density, of, the, sun, or, approximately, 10, 6, g, cm, 3, or, 1, tonne, per, cubic, centimetre, a, typical, white, dwarf, has, a, density, of, between, 10, 4, and, 10, 7, g, cm, 3, white, dwarfs, are, composed, of, one, of, the, densest, forms, of, matter, known, surpassed, only, by, other, compact, stars, such, as, neutron, stars, quark, stars, hypothetical, and, black, holes, white, dwarfs, were, found, to, be, extremely, dense, soon, after, their, discovery, if, a, star, is, in, a, binary, system, as, is, the, case, for, sirius, b, or, 40, eridani, b, it, is, possible, to, estimate, its, mass, from, observations, of, the, binary, orbit, this, was, done, for, sirius, b, by, 1910, yielding, a, mass, estimate, of, 0, 94, m, which, compares, well, with, a, more, modern, estimate, of, 1, 00, m, since, hotter, bodies, radiate, more, energy, than, colder, ones, a, star, s, surface, brightness, can, be, estimated, from, its, effective, surface, temperature, and, that, from, its, spectrum, if, the, star, s, distance, is, known, its, absolute, luminosity, can, also, be, estimated, from, the, absolute, luminosity, and, distance, the, star, s, surface, area, and, its, radius, can, be, calculated, reasoning, of, this, sort, led, to, the, realization, puzzling, to, astronomers, at, the, time, that, due, to, their, relatively, high, temperature, and, relatively, low, absolute, luminosity, sirius, b, and, 40, eridani, b, must, be, very, dense, when, ernst, pik, estimated, the, density, of, a, number, of, visual, binary, stars, in, 1916, he, found, that, 40, eridani, b, had, a, density, of, over, 25, 000, times, the, sun, s, which, was, so, high, that, he, called, it, impossible, as, arthur, eddington, put, it, later, in, 1927, 50, we, learn, about, the, stars, by, receiving, and, interpreting, the, messages, which, their, light, brings, to, us, the, message, of, the, companion, of, sirius, when, it, was, decoded, ran, i, am, composed, of, material, 3, 000, times, denser, than, anything, you, have, ever, come, across, a, ton, of, my, material, would, be, a, little, nugget, that, you, could, put, in, a, matchbox, what, reply, can, one, make, to, such, a, message, the, reply, which, most, of, us, made, in, 1914, was, shut, up, don, t, talk, nonsense, as, eddington, pointed, out, in, 1924, densities, of, this, order, implied, that, according, to, the, theory, of, general, relativity, the, light, from, sirius, b, should, be, gravitationally, redshifted, this, was, confirmed, when, adams, measured, this, redshift, in, 1925, such, densities, are, possible, because, white, dwarf, material, is, not, composed, of, atoms, joined, by, chemical, bonds, but, rather, consists, of, a, plasma, of, unbound, nuclei, and, electrons, there, is, therefore, no, obstacle, to, placing, nuclei, closer, than, normally, allowed, by, electron, orbitals, limited, by, normal, matter, eddington, wondered, what, would, happen, when, this, plasma, cooled, and, the, energy, to, keep, the, atoms, ionized, was, no, longer, sufficient, this, paradox, was, resolved, by, r, h, fowler, in, 1926, by, an, application, of, the, newly, devised, quantum, mechanics, since, electrons, obey, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, no, two, electrons, can, occupy, the, same, state, and, they, must, obey, fermi, dirac, statistics, also, introduced, in, 1926, to, determine, the, statistical, distribution, of, particles, which, satisfy, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, at, zero, temperature, therefore, electrons, can, not, all, occupy, the, lowest, energy, or, ground, state, some, of, them, would, have, to, occupy, higher, energy, states, forming, a, band, of, lowest, available, energy, states, the, fermi, sea, this, state, of, the, electrons, called, degenerate, meant, that, a, white, dwarf, could, cool, to, zero, temperature, and, still, possess, high, energy, compression, of, a, white, dwarf, will, increase, the, number, of, electrons, in, a, given, volume, applying, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, this, will, increase, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, electrons, thereby, increasing, the, pressure, this, electron, degeneracy, pressure, supports, a, white, dwarf, against, gravitational, collapse, the, pressure, depends, only, on, density, and, not, on, temperature, degenerate, matter, is, relatively, compressible, this, means, that, the, density, of, a, high, mass, white, dwarf, is, much, greater, than, that, of, a, low, mass, white, dwarf, and, that, the, radius, of, a, white, dwarf, decreases, as, its, mass, increases, the, existence, of, a, limiting, mass, that, no, white, dwarf, can, exceed, without, collapsing, to, a, neutron, star, is, another, consequence, of, being, supported, by, electron, degeneracy, pressure, such, limiting, masses, were, calculated, for, cases, of, an, idealized, constant, density, star, in, 1929, by, wilhelm, anderson, and, in, 1930, by, edmund, c, stoner, this, value, was, corrected, by, considering, hydrostatic, equilibrium, for, the, density, profile, and, the, presently, known, value, of, the, limit, was, first, published, in, 1931, by, subrahmanyan, chandrasekhar, in, his, paper, the, maximum, mass, of, ideal, white, dwarfs, for, a, non, rotating, white, dwarf, it, is, equal, to, approximately, 5, 7, m, e, 2, where, e, is, the, average, molecular, weight, per, electron, of, the, star, eqn, 63, as, the, carbon, 12, and, oxygen, 16, which, predominantly, compose, a, carbon, oxygen, white, dwarf, both, have, atomic, numbers, equal, to, half, their, atomic, weight, one, should, take, e, equal, to, 2, for, such, a, star, leading, to, the, commonly, quoted, value, of, 1, 4, m, near, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, there, was, reason, to, believe, that, stars, were, composed, chiefly, of, heavy, elements, 955, so, in, his, 1931, paper, chandrasekhar, set, the, average, molecular, weight, per, electron, e, equal, to, 2, 5, giving, a, limit, of, 0, 91, m, together, with, william, alfred, fowler, chandrasekhar, received, the, nobel, prize, for, this, and, other, work, in, 1983, the, limiting, mass, is, now, called, the, chandrasekhar, limit, if, a, white, dwarf, were, to, exceed, the, chandrasekhar, limit, and, nuclear, reactions, did, not, take, place, the, pressure, exerted, by, electrons, would, no, longer, be, able, to, balance, the, force, of, gravity, and, it, would, collapse, into, a, denser, object, called, a, neutron, star, carbon, oxygen, white, dwarfs, accreting, mass, from, a, neighboring, star, undergo, a, runaway, nuclear, fusion, reaction, which, leads, to, a, type, ia, supernova, explosion, in, which, the, white, dwarf, may, be, destroyed, before, it, reaches, the, limiting, mass, new, research, indicates, that, many, white, dwarfs, at, least, in, certain, types, of, galaxies, may, not, approach, that, limit, by, way, of, accretion, it, has, been, postulated, that, at, least, some, of, the, white, dwarfs, that, become, supernovae, attain, the, necessary, mass, by, colliding, with, one, another, it, may, be, that, in, elliptical, galaxies, such, collisions, are, the, major, source, of, supernovae, this, hypothesis, is, based, on, the, fact, that, the, x, rays, produced, by, those, galaxies, are, 30, to, 50, times, less, than, what, is, expected, to, be, produced, by, type, ia, supernovas, of, that, galaxy, as, matter, accretes, on, the, white, dwarf, from, its, encircling, companion, it, has, been, concluded, that, no, more, than, 5, percent, of, the, supernovae, in, such, galaxies, could, be, created, by, the, process, of, accretion, onto, white, dwarfs, the, significance, of, this, finding, is, that, there, could, be, two, types, of, supernovae, which, could, mean, that, the, chandrasekhar, limit, might, not, always, apply, in, determining, when, a, white, dwarf, goes, supernova, given, that, two, colliding, white, dwarfs, could, have, a, range, of, masses, this, in, turn, would, confuse, efforts, to, use, exploding, white, dwarfs, as, standard, candles, in, determining, distances, white, dwarfs, have, low, luminosity, and, therefore, occupy, a, strip, at, the, bottom, of, the, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, a, graph, of, stellar, luminosity, versus, color, or, temperature, they, should, not, be, confused, with, low, luminosity, objects, at, the, low, mass, end, of, the, main, sequence, such, as, the, hydrogen, fusing, red, dwarfs, whose, cores, are, supported, in, part, by, thermal, pressure, or, the, even, lower, temperature, brown, dwarfs, the, relationship, between, the, mass, and, radius, of, low, mass, white, dwarfs, can, be, estimated, using, the, nonrelativistic, fermi, gas, equation, of, state, which, gives, where, r, is, the, radius, m, is, the, total, mass, of, the, star, n, is, the, number, of, electrons, per, unit, mass, dependent, only, on, composition, m, e, is, the, electron, mass, displaystyle, hbar, is, the, reduced, planck, constant, and, g, is, the, gravitational, constant, since, this, analysis, uses, the, non, relativistic, formula, t, p, 2, 2, m, for, the, kinetic, energy, it, is, non, relativistic, when, the, electron, velocity, in, a, white, dwarf, is, close, to, the, speed, of, light, the, kinetic, energy, formula, approaches, t, pc, where, c, is, the, speed, of, light, and, it, can, be, shown, that, there, is, no, stable, equilibrium, in, the, ultrarelativistic, limit, in, particular, this, analysis, yields, the, maximum, mass, of, a, white, dwarf, which, is, for, a, more, accurate, computation, of, the, mass, radius, relationship, and, limiting, mass, of, a, white, dwarf, one, must, compute, the, equation, of, state, which, describes, the, relationship, between, density, and, pressure, in, the, white, dwarf, material, if, the, density, and, pressure, are, both, set, equal, to, functions, of, the, radius, from, the, center, of, the, star, the, system, of, equations, consisting, of, the, hydrostatic, equation, together, with, the, equation, of, state, can, then, be, solved, to, find, the, structure, of, the, white, dwarf, at, equilibrium, in, the, non, relativistic, case, we, will, still, find, that, the, radius, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, cube, root, of, the, mass, eqn, 80, relativistic, corrections, will, alter, the, result, so, that, the, radius, becomes, zero, at, a, finite, value, of, the, mass, this, is, the, limiting, value, of, the, mass, called, the, chandrasekhar, limit, at, which, the, white, dwarf, can, no, longer, be, supported, by, electron, degeneracy, pressure, the, graph, on, the, right, shows, the, result, of, such, a, computation, it, shows, how, radius, varies, with, mass, for, non, relativistic, blue, curve, and, relativistic, green, curve, models, of, a, white, dwarf, both, models, treat, the, white, dwarf, as, a, cold, fermi, gas, in, hydrostatic, equilibrium, the, average, molecular, weight, per, electron, e, has, been, set, equal, to, 2, radius, is, measured, in, standard, solar, radii, and, mass, in, standard, solar, masses, these, computations, all, assume, that, the, white, dwarf, is, non, rotating, if, the, white, dwarf, is, rotating, the, equation, of, hydrostatic, equilibrium, must, be, modified, to, take, into, account, the, centrifugal, pseudo, force, arising, from, working, in, a, rotating, frame, for, a, uniformly, rotating, white, dwarf, the, limiting, mass, increases, only, slightly, if, the, star, is, allowed, to, rotate, nonuniformly, and, viscosity, is, neglected, then, as, was, pointed, out, by, fred, hoyle, in, 1947, there, is, no, limit, to, the, mass, for, which, it, is, possible, for, a, model, white, dwarf, to, be, in, static, equilibrium, not, all, of, these, model, stars, will, be, dynamically, stable, rotating, white, dwarfs, and, the, estimates, of, their, diameter, in, terms, of, the, angular, velocity, of, rotation, has, been, treated, in, the, rigorous, mathematical, literature, the, fine, structure, of, the, free, boundary, of, white, dwarfs, has, also, been, analysed, mathematically, rigorously, the, degenerate, matter, that, makes, up, the, bulk, of, a, white, dwarf, has, a, very, low, opacity, because, any, absorption, of, a, photon, requires, that, an, electron, must, transition, to, a, higher, empty, state, which, may, not, be, possible, as, the, energy, of, the, photon, may, not, be, a, match, for, the, possible, quantum, states, available, to, that, electron, hence, radiative, heat, transfer, within, a, white, dwarf, is, low, it, does, however, have, a, high, thermal, conductivity, as, a, result, the, interior, of, the, white, dwarf, maintains, an, almost, uniform, temperature, as, it, cools, down, starting, at, approximately, 10, 8, k, shortly, after, the, formation, of, the, white, dwarf, and, reaching, less, than, 10, 6, k, for, the, coolest, known, white, dwarfs, an, outer, shell, of, non, degenerate, matter, sits, on, top, of, the, degenerate, core, the, outermost, layers, which, have, temperatures, below, 10, 5, k, radiate, roughly, as, a, black, body, a, white, dwarf, remains, visible, for, a, long, time, as, its, tenuous, outer, atmosphere, slowly, radiates, the, thermal, content, of, the, degenerate, interior, the, visible, radiation, emitted, by, white, dwarfs, varies, over, a, wide, color, range, from, the, whitish, blue, color, of, an, o, b, or, a, type, main, sequence, star, to, the, yellow, orange, of, a, late, k, or, early, m, type, star, white, dwarf, effective, surface, temperatures, extend, from, over, 150, 000, k, to, barely, under, 4, 000, k, in, accordance, with, the, stefan, boltzmann, law, luminosity, increases, with, increasing, surface, temperature, proportional, to, t, 4, this, surface, temperature, range, corresponds, to, a, luminosity, from, over, 100, times, the, sun, s, to, under, 1, 10, 000, that, of, the, sun, s, hot, white, dwarfs, with, surface, temperatures, in, excess, of, 30, 000, k, have, been, observed, to, be, sources, of, soft, i, e, lower, energy, x, rays, this, enables, the, composition, and, structure, of, their, atmospheres, to, be, studied, by, soft, x, ray, and, extreme, ultraviolet, observations, white, dwarfs, also, radiate, neutrinos, through, the, urca, process, this, process, has, more, effect, on, hotter, and, younger, white, dwarfs, as, was, explained, by, leon, mestel, in, 1952, unless, the, white, dwarf, accretes, matter, from, a, companion, star, or, other, source, its, radiation, comes, from, its, stored, heat, which, is, not, replenished, 2, 1, white, dwarfs, have, an, extremely, small, surface, area, to, radiate, this, heat, from, so, they, cool, gradually, remaining, hot, for, a, long, time, as, a, white, dwarf, cools, its, surface, temperature, decreases, the, radiation, which, it, emits, reddens, and, its, luminosity, decreases, since, the, white, dwarf, has, no, energy, sink, other, than, radiation, it, follows, that, its, cooling, slows, with, time, the, rate, of, cooling, has, been, estimated, for, a, carbon, white, dwarf, of, 0, 59, m, with, a, hydrogen, atmosphere, after, initially, taking, approximately, 1, 5, billion, years, to, cool, to, a, surface, temperature, of, 7, 140, k, cooling, approximately, 500, more, kelvins, to, 6, 590, k, takes, around, 0, 3, billion, years, but, the, next, two, steps, of, around, 500, kelvins, to, 6, 030, k, and, 5, 550, k, take, first, 0, 4, and, then, 1, 1, billion, years, table, 2, most, observed, white, dwarfs, have, relatively, high, surface, temperatures, between, 8, 000, k, and, 40, 000, k, a, white, dwarf, though, spends, more, of, its, lifetime, at, cooler, temperatures, than, at, hotter, temperatures, so, we, should, expect, that, there, are, more, cool, white, dwarfs, than, hot, white, dwarfs, once, we, adjust, for, the, selection, effect, that, hotter, more, luminous, white, dwarfs, are, easier, to, observe, we, do, find, that, decreasing, the, temperature, range, examined, results, in, finding, more, white, dwarfs, this, trend, stops, when, we, reach, extremely, cool, white, dwarfs, few, white, dwarfs, are, observed, with, surface, temperatures, below, 4, 000, k, and, one, of, the, coolest, so, far, observed, wd, 0346, 246, has, a, surface, temperature, of, approximately, 3, 800, k, the, reason, for, this, is, that, the, universe, s, age, is, finite, there, has, not, been, enough, time, for, white, dwarfs, to, cool, below, this, temperature, the, white, dwarf, luminosity, function, can, therefore, be, used, to, find, the, time, when, stars, started, to, form, in, a, region, an, estimate, for, the, age, of, our, galactic, disk, found, in, this, way, is, 8, billion, years, a, white, dwarf, will, eventually, in, many, trillions, of, years, cool, and, become, a, non, radiating, black, dwarf, in, approximate, thermal, equilibrium, with, its, surroundings, and, with, the, cosmic, background, radiation, no, black, dwarfs, are, thought, to, exist, yet, white, dwarf, core, material, is, a, completely, ionized, plasma, a, mixture, of, nuclei, and, electrons, that, is, initially, in, a, fluid, state, it, was, theoretically, predicted, in, the, 1960s, that, at, a, late, stage, of, cooling, it, should, crystallize, into, a, solid, state, starting, at, its, center, the, crystal, structure, is, thought, to, be, a, body, centered, cubic, lattice, in, 1995, it, was, suggested, that, asteroseismological, observations, of, pulsating, white, dwarfs, yielded, a, potential, test, of, the, crystallization, theory, and, in, 2004, observations, were, made, that, suggested, approximately, 90, of, the, mass, of, bpm, 37093, had, crystallized, other, work, gives, a, crystallized, mass, fraction, of, between, 32, and, 82, as, a, white, dwarf, core, undergoes, crystallization, into, a, solid, phase, latent, heat, is, released, which, provides, a, source, of, thermal, energy, that, delays, its, cooling, another, possible, mechanism, that, was, suggested, to, explain, the, seeming, delay, in, the, cooling, of, some, types, of, white, dwarves, is, a, solid, liquid, distillation, process, the, crystals, formed, in, the, core, are, buoyant, and, float, up, thereby, displacing, heavier, liquid, downward, thus, causing, a, net, release, of, gravitational, energy, chemical, fractionation, between, the, ionic, species, in, the, plasma, mixture, can, release, a, similar, or, even, greater, amount, of, energy, this, energy, release, was, first, confirmed, in, 2019, after, the, identification, of, a, pile, up, in, the, cooling, sequence, of, more, than, 15, 000, white, dwarfs, observed, with, the, gaia, satellite, low, mass, helium, white, dwarfs, mass, 0, 20, m, often, referred, to, as, extremely, low, mass, white, dwarfs, elm, wds, are, formed, in, binary, systems, as, a, result, of, their, hydrogen, rich, envelopes, residual, hydrogen, burning, via, the, cno, cycle, may, keep, these, white, dwarfs, hot, on, a, long, timescale, in, addition, they, remain, in, a, bloated, proto, white, dwarf, stage, for, up, to, 2, gyr, before, they, reach, the, cooling, track, although, most, white, dwarfs, are, thought, to, be, composed, of, carbon, and, oxygen, spectroscopy, typically, shows, that, their, emitted, light, comes, from, an, atmosphere, which, is, observed, to, be, either, hydrogen, or, helium, dominated, the, dominant, element, is, usually, at, least, 1, 000, times, more, abundant, than, all, other, elements, as, explained, by, schatzman, in, the, 1940s, the, high, surface, gravity, is, thought, to, cause, this, purity, by, gravitationally, separating, the, atmosphere, so, that, heavy, elements, are, below, and, the, lighter, above, 5, 6, this, atmosphere, the, only, part, of, the, white, dwarf, visible, to, us, is, thought, to, be, the, top, of, an, envelope, which, is, a, residue, of, the, star, s, envelope, in, the, agb, phase, and, may, also, contain, material, accreted, from, the, interstellar, medium, the, envelope, is, believed, to, consist, of, a, helium, rich, layer, with, mass, no, more, than, 1, 100, of, the, star, s, total, mass, which, if, the, atmosphere, is, hydrogen, dominated, is, overlain, by, a, hydrogen, rich, layer, with, mass, approximately, 1, 10, 000, of, the, star, s, total, mass, 4, 5, although, thin, these, outer, layers, determine, the, thermal, evolution, of, the, white, dwarf, the, degenerate, electrons, in, the, bulk, of, a, white, dwarf, conduct, heat, well, most, of, a, white, dwarf, s, mass, is, therefore, at, almost, the, same, temperature, isothermal, and, it, is, also, hot, a, white, dwarf, with, surface, temperature, between, 8, 000, k, and, 16, 000, k, will, have, a, core, temperature, between, approximately, 5, 000, 000, k, and, 20, 000, 000, k, the, white, dwarf, is, kept, from, cooling, very, quickly, only, by, its, outer, layers, opacity, to, radiation, the, first, attempt, to, classify, white, dwarf, spectra, appears, to, have, been, by, g, p, kuiper, in, 1941, and, various, classification, schemes, have, been, proposed, and, used, since, then, the, system, currently, in, use, was, introduced, by, edward, m, sion, jesse, l, greenstein, and, their, coauthors, in, 1983, and, has, been, subsequently, revised, several, times, it, classifies, a, spectrum, by, a, symbol, which, consists, of, an, initial, d, a, letter, describing, the, primary, feature, of, the, spectrum, followed, by, an, optional, sequence, of, letters, describing, secondary, features, of, the, spectrum, as, shown, in, the, adjacent, table, and, a, temperature, index, number, computed, by, dividing, 50, 400, k, by, the, effective, temperature, for, example, the, symbols, and, may, also, be, used, if, the, correct, classification, is, uncertain, white, dwarfs, whose, primary, spectral, classification, is, da, have, hydrogen, dominated, atmospheres, they, make, up, the, majority, approximately, 80, of, all, observed, white, dwarfs, the, next, class, in, number, is, of, dbs, approximately, 16, the, hot, above, 15, 000, k, dq, class, roughly, 0, 1, have, carbon, dominated, atmospheres, those, classified, as, db, dc, do, dz, and, cool, dq, have, helium, dominated, atmospheres, assuming, that, carbon, and, metals, are, not, present, which, spectral, classification, is, seen, depends, on, the, effective, temperature, between, approximately, 100, 000, k, to, 45, 000, k, the, spectrum, will, be, classified, do, dominated, by, singly, ionized, helium, from, 30, 000, k, to, 12, 000, k, the, spectrum, will, be, db, showing, neutral, helium, lines, and, below, about, 12, 000, k, the, spectrum, will, be, featureless, and, classified, dc, 2, 4, molecular, hydrogen, h, 2, has, been, detected, in, spectra, of, the, atmospheres, of, some, white, dwarfs, around, 25, 33, of, white, dwarfs, have, metal, lines, in, their, spectra, which, is, notable, because, any, heavy, elements, in, a, white, dwarf, should, sink, into, the, star, s, interior, in, just, a, small, fraction, of, the, star, s, lifetime, the, prevailing, explanation, for, metal, rich, white, dwarfs, is, that, they, have, recently, accreted, rocky, planetesimals, the, bulk, composition, of, the, accreted, object, can, be, measured, from, the, strengths, of, the, metal, lines, for, example, a, 2015, study, of, the, white, dwarf, ton, 345, concluded, that, its, metal, abundances, were, consistent, with, those, of, a, differentiated, rocky, planet, whose, mantle, had, been, eroded, by, the, host, star, s, wind, during, its, asymptotic, giant, branch, phase, magnetic, fields, in, white, dwarfs, with, a, strength, at, the, surface, of, c, 1, million, gauss, 100, teslas, were, predicted, by, p, m, s, blackett, in, 1947, as, a, consequence, of, a, physical, law, he, had, proposed, which, stated, that, an, uncharged, rotating, body, should, generate, a, magnetic, field, proportional, to, its, angular, momentum, this, putative, law, sometimes, called, the, blackett, effect, was, never, generally, accepted, and, by, the, 1950s, even, blackett, felt, it, had, been, refuted, 39, 43, in, the, 1960s, it, was, proposed, that, white, dwarfs, might, have, magnetic, fields, due, to, conservation, of, total, surface, magnetic, flux, that, existed, in, its, progenitor, star, phase, a, surface, magnetic, field, of, c, 100, gauss, 0, 01, t, in, the, progenitor, star, would, thus, become, a, surface, magnetic, field, of, c, 100, 100, 2, 1, million, gauss, 100, t, once, the, star, s, radius, had, shrunk, by, a, factor, of, 100, 8, 484, the, first, magnetic, white, dwarf, to, be, discovered, was, gj, 742, also, known, as, grw, 70, 8247, which, was, identified, by, james, kemp, john, swedlund, john, landstreet, and, roger, angel, in, 1970, to, host, a, magnetic, field, by, its, emission, of, circularly, polarized, light, it, is, thought, to, have, a, surface, field, of, approximately, 300, million, gauss, 30, kt, 8, since, 1970, magnetic, fields, have, been, discovered, in, well, over, 200, white, dwarfs, ranging, from, 2, 10, 3, to, 10, 9, gauss, 0, 2, t, to, 100, kt, the, large, number, of, presently, known, magnetic, white, dwarfs, is, due, to, the, fact, that, most, white, dwarfs, are, identified, by, low, resolution, spectroscopy, which, is, able, to, reveal, the, presence, of, a, magnetic, field, of, 1, megagauss, or, more, thus, the, basic, identification, process, also, sometimes, results, in, discovery, of, magnetic, fields, it, has, been, estimated, that, at, least, 10, of, white, dwarfs, have, fields, in, excess, of, 1, million, gauss, 100, t, the, highly, magnetized, white, dwarf, in, the, binary, system, ar, scorpii, was, identified, in, 2016, as, the, first, pulsar, in, which, the, compact, object, is, a, white, dwarf, instead, of, a, neutron, star, the, magnetic, fields, in, a, white, dwarf, may, allow, for, the, existence, of, a, new, type, of, chemical, bond, perpendicular, paramagnetic, bonding, in, addition, to, ionic, and, covalent, bonds, resulting, in, what, has, been, initially, described, as, magnetized, matter, in, research, published, in, 2012, early, calculations, suggested, that, there, might, be, white, dwarfs, whose, luminosity, varied, with, a, period, of, around, 10, seconds, but, searches, in, the, 1960s, failed, to, observe, this, 7, 1, 1, the, first, variable, white, dwarf, found, was, hl, tau, 76, in, 1965, and, 1966, and, was, observed, to, vary, with, a, period, of, approximately, 12, 5, minutes, the, reason, for, this, period, being, longer, than, predicted, is, that, the, variability, of, hl, tau, 76, like, that, of, the, other, pulsating, variable, white, dwarfs, known, arises, from, non, radial, gravity, wave, pulsations, 7, known, types, of, pulsating, white, dwarf, include, the, dav, or, zz, ceti, stars, including, hl, tau, 76, with, hydrogen, dominated, atmospheres, and, the, spectral, type, da, 891, 895, dbv, or, v777, her, stars, with, helium, dominated, atmospheres, and, the, spectral, type, db, 3525, and, gw, vir, stars, sometimes, subdivided, into, dov, and, pnnv, stars, with, atmospheres, dominated, by, helium, carbon, and, oxygen, gw, vir, stars, are, not, strictly, speaking, white, dwarfs, but, are, stars, which, are, in, a, position, on, the, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, between, the, asymptotic, giant, branch, and, the, white, dwarf, region, they, may, be, called, pre, white, dwarfs, these, variables, all, exhibit, small, 1, 30, variations, in, light, output, arising, from, a, superposition, of, vibrational, modes, with, periods, of, hundreds, to, thousands, of, seconds, observation, of, these, variations, gives, asteroseismological, evidence, about, the, interiors, of, white, dwarfs, white, dwarfs, are, thought, to, represent, the, end, point, of, stellar, evolution, for, main, sequence, stars, with, masses, from, about, 0, 07, to, 10, m, the, composition, of, the, white, dwarf, produced, will, depend, on, the, initial, mass, of, the, star, current, galactic, models, suggest, the, milky, way, galaxy, currently, contains, about, ten, billion, white, dwarfs, if, the, mass, of, a, main, sequence, star, is, lower, than, approximately, half, a, solar, mass, it, will, never, become, hot, enough, to, ignite, and, fuse, helium, in, its, core, it, is, thought, that, over, a, lifespan, that, considerably, exceeds, the, age, of, the, universe, c, 13, 8, billion, years, such, a, star, will, eventually, burn, all, its, hydrogen, for, a, while, becoming, a, blue, dwarf, and, end, its, evolution, as, a, helium, white, dwarf, composed, chiefly, of, helium, 4, nuclei, due, to, the, very, long, time, this, process, takes, it, is, not, thought, to, be, the, origin, of, the, observed, helium, white, dwarfs, rather, they, are, thought, to, be, the, product, of, mass, loss, in, binary, systems, or, mass, loss, due, to, a, large, planetary, companion, if, the, mass, of, a, main, sequence, star, is, between, 0, 5, and, 8, m, its, core, will, become, sufficiently, hot, to, fuse, helium, into, carbon, and, oxygen, via, the, triple, alpha, process, but, it, will, never, become, sufficiently, hot, to, fuse, carbon, into, neon, near, the, end, of, the, period, in, which, it, undergoes, fusion, reactions, such, a, star, will, have, a, carbon, oxygen, core, which, does, not, undergo, fusion, reactions, surrounded, by, an, inner, helium, burning, shell, and, an, outer, hydrogen, burning, shell, on, the, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, it, will, be, found, on, the, asymptotic, giant, branch, it, will, then, expel, most, of, its, outer, material, creating, a, planetary, nebula, until, only, the, carbon, oxygen, core, is, left, this, process, is, responsible, for, the, carbon, oxygen, white, dwarfs, which, form, the, vast, majority, of, observed, white, dwarfs, if, a, star, is, massive, enough, its, core, will, eventually, become, sufficiently, hot, to, fuse, carbon, to, neon, and, then, to, fuse, neon, to, iron, such, a, star, will, not, become, a, white, dwarf, because, the, mass, of, its, central, non, fusing, core, initially, supported, by, electron, degeneracy, pressure, will, eventually, exceed, the, largest, possible, mass, supportable, by, degeneracy, pressure, at, this, point, the, core, of, the, star, will, collapse, and, it, will, explode, in, a, core, collapse, supernova, which, will, leave, behind, a, remnant, neutron, star, black, hole, or, possibly, a, more, exotic, form, of, compact, star, some, main, sequence, stars, of, perhaps, 8, to, 10, m, although, sufficiently, massive, to, fuse, carbon, to, neon, and, magnesium, may, be, insufficiently, massive, to, fuse, neon, such, a, star, may, leave, a, remnant, white, dwarf, composed, chiefly, of, oxygen, neon, and, magnesium, provided, that, its, core, does, not, collapse, and, provided, that, fusion, does, not, proceed, so, violently, as, to, blow, apart, the, star, in, a, supernova, although, a, few, white, dwarfs, have, been, identified, which, may, be, of, this, type, most, evidence, for, the, existence, of, such, comes, from, the, novae, called, onemg, or, neon, novae, the, spectra, of, these, novae, exhibit, abundances, of, neon, magnesium, and, other, intermediate, mass, elements, which, appear, to, be, only, explicable, by, the, accretion, of, material, onto, an, oxygen, neon, magnesium, white, dwarf, type, iax, supernovae, that, involve, helium, accretion, by, a, white, dwarf, have, been, proposed, to, be, a, channel, for, transformation, of, this, type, of, stellar, remnant, in, this, scenario, the, carbon, detonation, produced, in, a, type, ia, supernova, is, too, weak, to, destroy, the, white, dwarf, expelling, just, a, small, part, of, its, mass, as, ejecta, but, produces, an, asymmetric, explosion, that, kicks, the, star, often, known, as, a, zombie, star, to, high, speeds, of, a, hypervelocity, star, the, matter, processed, in, the, failed, detonation, is, re, accreted, by, the, white, dwarf, with, the, heaviest, elements, such, as, iron, falling, to, its, core, where, it, accumulates, these, iron, core, white, dwarfs, would, be, smaller, than, the, carbon, oxygen, kind, of, similar, mass, and, would, cool, and, crystallize, faster, than, those, a, white, dwarf, is, stable, once, formed, and, will, continue, to, cool, almost, indefinitely, eventually, to, become, a, black, dwarf, assuming, that, the, universe, continues, to, expand, it, is, thought, that, in, 10, 19, to, 10, 20, years, the, galaxies, will, evaporate, as, their, stars, escape, into, intergalactic, space, iiia, white, dwarfs, should, generally, survive, galactic, dispersion, although, an, occasional, collision, between, white, dwarfs, may, produce, a, new, fusing, star, or, a, super, chandrasekhar, mass, white, dwarf, which, will, explode, in, a, type, ia, supernova, iiic, iv, the, subsequent, lifetime, of, white, dwarfs, is, thought, to, be, on, the, order, of, the, hypothetical, lifetime, of, the, proton, known, to, be, at, least, 10, 34, 10, 35, years, some, grand, unified, theories, predict, a, proton, lifetime, between, 10, 30, and, 10, 36, years, if, these, theories, are, not, valid, the, proton, might, still, decay, by, complicated, nuclear, reactions, or, through, quantum, gravitational, processes, involving, virtual, black, holes, in, these, cases, the, lifetime, is, estimated, to, be, no, more, than, 10, 200, years, if, protons, do, decay, the, mass, of, a, white, dwarf, will, decrease, very, slowly, with, time, as, its, nuclei, decay, until, it, loses, enough, mass, to, become, a, nondegenerate, lump, of, matter, and, finally, disappears, completely, iv, a, white, dwarf, can, also, be, cannibalized, or, evaporated, by, a, companion, star, causing, the, white, dwarf, to, lose, so, much, mass, that, it, becomes, a, planetary, mass, object, the, resultant, object, orbiting, the, former, companion, now, host, star, could, be, a, helium, planet, or, diamond, planet, a, white, dwarf, s, stellar, and, planetary, system, is, inherited, from, its, progenitor, star, and, may, interact, with, the, white, dwarf, in, various, ways, there, are, several, indications, that, a, white, dwarf, has, a, remnant, planetary, system, the, most, common, observable, evidence, of, a, remnant, planetary, system, is, pollution, of, the, spectrum, of, a, white, dwarf, with, metal, absorption, lines, 27, 50, of, white, dwarfs, show, a, spectrum, polluted, with, metals, but, these, heavy, elements, settle, out, in, the, atmosphere, of, white, dwarfs, colder, than, 20, 000, k, the, most, widely, accepted, hypothesis, is, that, this, pollution, comes, from, tidally, disrupted, rocky, bodies, the, first, observation, of, a, metal, polluted, white, dwarf, was, by, van, maanen, in, 1917, at, the, mount, wilson, observatory, and, is, now, recognized, as, the, first, evidence, of, exoplanets, in, astronomy, the, white, dwarf, van, maanen, 2, shows, iron, calcium, and, magnesium, in, its, atmosphere, but, van, maanen, misclassified, it, as, the, faintest, f, type, star, based, on, the, calcium, h, and, k, lines, the, nitrogen, in, white, dwarfs, is, thought, to, come, from, nitrogen, ice, of, extrasolar, kuiper, belt, objects, the, lithium, is, thought, to, come, from, accreted, crust, material, and, the, beryllium, is, thought, to, come, from, exomoons, a, less, common, observable, evidence, is, infrared, excess, due, to, a, flat, and, optically, thick, debris, disk, which, is, found, in, around, 1, 4, of, white, dwarfs, the, first, white, dwarf, with, infrared, excess, was, discovered, by, zuckerman, and, becklin, in, 1987, in, the, near, infrared, around, giclas, 29, 38, and, later, confirmed, as, a, debris, disk, white, dwarfs, hotter, than, 27, 000, k, sublimate, all, the, dust, formed, by, tidally, disrupting, a, rocky, body, preventing, the, formation, of, a, debris, disk, in, colder, white, dwarfs, a, rocky, body, might, be, tidally, disrupted, near, the, roche, radius, and, forced, into, a, circular, orbit, by, the, poynting, robertson, drag, which, is, stronger, for, less, massive, white, dwarfs, the, poynting, robertson, drag, will, also, cause, the, dust, to, orbit, closer, and, closer, towards, the, white, dwarf, until, it, will, eventually, sublimate, and, the, disk, will, disappear, a, debris, disk, will, have, a, lifetime, of, around, a, few, million, years, for, white, dwarfs, hotter, than, 10, 000, k, colder, white, dwarfs, can, have, disk, lifetimes, of, a, few, 10, million, years, which, is, enough, time, to, tidally, disrupt, a, second, rocky, body, and, forming, a, second, disk, around, a, white, dwarf, such, as, the, two, rings, around, lspm, j0207, 3331, the, least, common, observable, evidence, of, planetary, systems, are, detected, major, or, minor, planets, only, a, handful, of, giant, planets, and, a, handful, of, minor, planets, are, known, around, white, dwarfs, it, is, a, growing, list, with, discoveries, of, around, 6, exoplanets, expected, with, gaia, exoplanets, with, jwst, are, expected, to, be, 4, and, 4, 8, infrared, spectroscopic, observations, made, by, nasa, s, spitzer, space, telescope, of, the, central, star, of, the, helix, nebula, suggest, the, presence, of, a, dust, cloud, which, may, be, caused, by, cometary, collisions, it, is, possible, that, infalling, material, from, this, may, cause, x, ray, emission, from, the, central, star, similarly, observations, made, in, 2004, indicated, the, presence, of, a, dust, cloud, around, the, young, estimated, to, have, formed, from, its, agb, progenitor, about, 500, million, years, ago, white, dwarf, g29, 38, which, may, have, been, created, by, tidal, disruption, of, a, comet, passing, close, to, the, white, dwarf, some, estimations, based, on, the, metal, content, of, the, atmospheres, of, the, white, dwarfs, consider, that, at, least, 15, of, them, may, be, orbited, by, planets, or, asteroids, or, at, least, their, debris, another, suggested, idea, is, that, white, dwarfs, could, be, orbited, by, the, stripped, cores, of, rocky, planets, that, would, have, survived, the, red, giant, phase, of, their, star, but, losing, their, outer, layers, and, given, those, planetary, remnants, would, likely, be, made, of, metals, to, attempt, to, detect, them, looking, for, the, signatures, of, their, interaction, with, the, white, dwarf, s, magnetic, field, other, suggested, ideas, of, how, white, dwarfs, are, polluted, with, dust, involve, the, scattering, of, asteroids, by, planets, or, via, planet, planet, scattering, liberation, of, exomoons, from, their, host, planet, could, cause, white, dwarf, pollution, with, dust, either, the, liberation, could, cause, asteroids, to, be, scattered, towards, the, white, dwarf, or, the, exomoon, could, be, scattered, into, the, roche, radius, of, the, white, dwarf, the, mechanism, behind, the, pollution, of, white, dwarfs, in, binaries, was, also, explored, as, these, systems, are, more, likely, to, lack, a, major, planet, but, this, idea, cannot, explain, the, presence, of, dust, around, single, white, dwarfs, while, old, white, dwarfs, show, evidence, of, dust, accretion, white, dwarfs, older, than, 1, billion, years, or, 7000, k, with, dusty, infrared, excess, were, not, detected, until, the, discovery, of, lspm, j0207, 3331, in, 2018, which, has, a, cooling, age, of, 3, billion, years, the, white, dwarf, shows, two, dusty, components, that, are, being, explained, with, two, rings, with, different, temperatures, the, metal, rich, white, dwarf, wd, 1145, 017, is, the, first, white, dwarf, observed, with, a, disintegrating, minor, planet, which, transits, the, star, the, disintegration, of, the, planetesimal, generates, a, debris, cloud, which, passes, in, front, of, the, star, every, 4, 5, hours, causing, a, 5, minute, long, fade, in, the, star, s, optical, brightness, the, depth, of, the, transit, is, highly, variable, the, giant, planet, wd, j0914, 1914b, is, being, evaporated, by, the, strong, ultraviolet, radiation, of, the, hot, white, dwarf, part, of, the, evaporated, material, is, being, accreted, in, a, gaseous, disk, around, the, white, dwarf, the, weak, hydrogen, line, as, well, as, other, lines, in, the, spectrum, of, the, white, dwarf, revealed, the, presence, of, the, giant, planet, the, white, dwarf, wd, 0145, 234, shows, brightening, in, the, mid, infrared, seen, in, neowise, data, the, brightening, is, not, seen, before, 2018, it, is, interpreted, as, the, tidal, disruption, of, an, exoasteroid, the, first, time, such, an, event, has, been, observed, wd, 1856, 534, is, the, first, and, only, transiting, major, planet, around, a, white, dwarf, as, of, 2022, gd, 140, and, lawd, 37, are, suspected, to, have, giant, exoplanets, due, to, anomaly, in, the, hipparcos, gaia, proper, motion, for, gd, 140, it, is, suspected, to, be, a, planet, several, times, more, massive, than, jupiter, and, for, lawd, 37, it, is, suspected, to, be, a, planet, less, massive, than, jupiter, additionally, wd, 0141, 675, was, suspected, to, have, a, super, jupiter, with, an, orbital, period, of, 33, 65, days, based, on, gaia, astrometry, this, is, remarkable, because, wd, 0141, 675, is, polluted, with, metals, and, metal, polluted, white, dwarfs, have, long, be, suspected, to, host, giant, planets, that, disturb, the, orbits, of, minor, planets, causing, the, pollution, both, gd, 140, and, wd, 0141, will, be, observed, with, jwst, in, cycle, 2, with, the, aim, to, detect, infrared, excess, caused, by, the, planets, however, the, planet, candidate, at, wd, 0141, 675, was, found, to, be, a, false, positive, caused, by, a, software, error, a, jwst, survey, of, four, metal, polluted, white, dwarfs, found, two, directly, imaged, exoplanet, candidates, with, masses, of, 1, 7, m, j, one, orbits, around, wd, 1202, 232, lp, 852, 7, and, the, other, around, wd, 2105, 82, lawd, 83, if, confirmed, they, would, be, the, first, directly, imaged, planets, that, likely, formed, from, circumstellar, disk, material, representing, a, new, population, of, directly, imaged, giant, planets, that, are, more, similar, to, solar, system, giants, in, age, and, probably, also, in, their, atmosphere, confirmation, will, be, possible, via, the, common, proper, motion, method, with, jwst, in, 2024, it, was, discovered, that, the, white, dwarf, in, the, phl, 5038ab, system, is, polluted, with, calcium, from, rocky, material, the, white, dwarf, is, orbited, by, a, brown, dwarf, which, was, discovered, in, 2009, this, is, seen, as, perhaps, the, first, case, of, linking, white, dwarf, pollution, with, the, presence, of, a, substellar, object, it, is, thought, that, the, orbits, of, planetesimals, are, being, disrupted, by, the, brown, dwarf, causing, the, pollution, of, the, white, dwarf, in, 2024, a, planet, candidate, was, found, around, the, massive, white, dwarf, galex, j071816, 4, 373139, with, the, help, of, gaia, and, spitzer, the, candidate, has, a, mass, of, around, 3, 6, m, j, has, a, temperature, of, about, 400, kelvin, 127, c, 260, f, and, is, unresolved, the, white, dwarf, has, a, mass, of, 1, 29, m, and, is, probably, an, oxygen, neon, white, dwarf, it, has, been, proposed, that, white, dwarfs, with, surface, temperatures, of, less, than, 10, 000, k, could, harbor, a, habitable, zone, at, a, distance, of, c, 0, 005, to, 0, 02, au, that, would, last, upwards, of, 3, billion, years, this, is, so, close, that, any, habitable, planets, would, be, tidally, locked, the, goal, is, to, search, for, transits, of, hypothetical, earth, like, planets, that, could, have, migrated, inward, or, formed, there, as, a, white, dwarf, has, a, size, similar, to, that, of, a, planet, these, kinds, of, transits, would, produce, strong, eclipses, newer, research, casts, some, doubts, on, this, idea, given, that, the, close, orbits, of, those, hypothetical, planets, around, their, parent, stars, would, subject, them, to, strong, tidal, forces, that, could, render, them, uninhabitable, by, triggering, a, greenhouse, effect, another, suggested, constraint, to, this, idea, is, the, origin, of, those, planets, leaving, aside, formation, from, the, accretion, disk, surrounding, the, white, dwarf, there, are, two, ways, a, planet, could, end, in, a, close, orbit, around, stars, of, this, kind, by, surviving, being, engulfed, by, the, star, during, its, red, giant, phase, and, then, spiralling, inward, or, inward, migration, after, the, white, dwarf, has, formed, the, former, case, is, implausible, for, low, mass, bodies, as, they, are, unlikely, to, survive, being, absorbed, by, their, stars, in, the, latter, case, the, planets, would, have, to, expel, so, much, orbital, energy, as, heat, through, tidal, interactions, with, the, white, dwarf, that, they, would, likely, end, as, uninhabitable, embers, if, a, white, dwarf, is, in, a, binary, star, system, and, is, accreting, matter, from, its, companion, a, variety, of, phenomena, may, occur, including, novae, and, type, ia, supernovae, it, may, also, be, a, super, soft, x, ray, source, if, it, is, able, to, take, material, from, its, companion, fast, enough, to, sustain, fusion, on, its, surface, on, the, other, hand, phenomena, in, binary, systems, such, as, tidal, interaction, and, star, disc, interaction, moderated, by, magnetic, fields, or, not, act, on, the, rotation, of, accreting, white, dwarfs, in, fact, the, securely, known, fastest, spinning, white, dwarfs, are, members, of, binary, systems, the, fastest, one, being, the, white, dwarf, in, ctcv, j2056, 3014, a, close, binary, system, of, two, white, dwarfs, can, lose, angular, momentum, and, radiate, energy, in, the, form, of, gravitational, waves, causing, their, mutual, orbit, to, steadily, shrink, until, the, stars, merge, the, mass, of, an, isolated, nonrotating, white, dwarf, cannot, exceed, the, chandrasekhar, limit, of, 1, 4, m, this, limit, may, increase, if, the, white, dwarf, is, rotating, rapidly, and, nonuniformly, white, dwarfs, in, binary, systems, can, accrete, material, from, a, companion, star, increasing, both, their, mass, and, their, density, as, their, mass, approaches, the, chandrasekhar, limit, this, could, theoretically, lead, to, either, the, explosive, ignition, of, fusion, in, the, white, dwarf, or, its, collapse, into, a, neutron, star, there, are, two, models, that, might, explain, the, progenitor, systems, of, type, ia, supernovae, the, single, degenerate, model, and, the, double, degenerate, model, in, the, single, degenerate, model, a, carbon, oxygen, white, dwarf, accretes, mass, and, compresses, its, core, by, pulling, mass, from, a, companion, non, degenerate, star, 14, it, is, believed, that, compressional, heating, of, the, core, leads, to, ignition, of, carbon, fusion, as, the, mass, approaches, the, chandrasekhar, limit, because, the, white, dwarf, is, supported, against, gravity, by, quantum, degeneracy, pressure, instead, of, by, thermal, pressure, adding, heat, to, the, star, s, interior, increases, its, temperature, but, not, its, pressure, so, the, white, dwarf, does, not, expand, and, cool, in, response, rather, the, increased, temperature, accelerates, the, rate, of, the, fusion, reaction, in, a, runaway, process, that, feeds, on, itself, the, thermonuclear, flame, consumes, much, of, the, white, dwarf, in, a, few, seconds, causing, a, type, ia, supernova, explosion, that, obliterates, the, star, in, another, possible, mechanism, for, type, ia, supernovae, the, double, degenerate, model, two, carbon, oxygen, white, dwarfs, in, a, binary, system, merge, creating, an, object, with, mass, greater, than, the, chandrasekhar, limit, in, which, carbon, fusion, is, then, ignited, 14, in, both, cases, the, white, dwarfs, are, not, expected, to, survive, the, type, ia, supernova, the, single, degenerate, model, was, the, favored, mechanism, for, type, ia, supernovae, but, now, because, of, observations, the, double, degenerate, model, is, thought, to, be, the, more, likely, scenario, predicted, rates, of, white, dwarf, white, dwarf, mergers, are, comparable, to, the, rate, of, type, ia, supernovae, and, would, explain, the, lack, of, hydrogen, in, the, spectra, of, type, ia, supernovae, however, the, main, mechanism, for, type, ia, supernovae, remains, an, open, question, in, the, single, degenerate, scenario, the, accretion, rate, onto, the, white, dwarf, needs, to, be, within, a, narrow, range, dependent, on, its, mass, so, that, the, hydrogen, burning, on, the, surface, of, the, white, dwarf, is, stable, if, the, accretion, rate, is, too, low, novae, on, the, surface, of, the, white, dwarf, will, blow, away, accreted, material, if, it, s, too, high, the, white, dwarf, will, expand, and, the, white, dwarf, and, companion, star, will, be, in, a, common, envelope, this, stops, the, growth, of, the, white, dwarf, thus, preventing, it, from, reaching, the, chandrasekhar, limit, and, exploding, for, the, single, degenerate, model, its, companion, is, expected, to, survive, but, there, is, no, strong, evidence, of, such, a, star, near, type, ia, supernovae, sites, in, the, double, degenerate, scenario, white, dwarfs, need, to, be, in, very, close, binaries, otherwise, their, inspiral, time, is, longer, than, the, age, of, the, universe, it, is, also, likely, that, instead, of, a, type, ia, supernova, the, merger, of, two, white, dwarfs, will, lead, to, core, collapse, as, a, white, dwarf, accretes, material, quickly, the, core, can, ignite, off, center, which, leads, to, gravitational, instabilities, which, could, create, a, neutron, star, observations, have, failed, to, note, signs, of, accretion, leading, up, to, type, ia, supernovae, and, this, is, now, thought, to, be, because, the, star, is, first, loaded, up, to, above, the, chandrasekhar, limit, while, also, being, spun, up, to, a, very, high, rate, by, the, same, process, once, the, accretion, stops, the, star, gradually, slows, until, the, spin, is, no, longer, enough, to, prevent, the, explosion, the, historical, bright, sn, 1006, is, thought, to, have, been, a, type, ia, supernova, from, a, white, dwarf, possibly, the, merger, of, two, white, dwarfs, tycho, s, supernova, of, 1572, was, also, a, type, ia, supernova, and, its, remnant, has, been, detected, a, close, candidate, to, being, a, survivor, of, a, type, ia, supernova, is, wd, 0810, 353, a, post, common, envelope, binary, pceb, is, a, binary, consisting, of, a, white, dwarf, and, a, closely, tidally, locked, red, dwarf, in, other, cases, this, might, be, a, brown, dwarf, instead, of, a, red, dwarf, these, binaries, form, when, the, red, dwarf, is, engulfed, in, the, red, giant, phase, as, the, red, dwarf, orbits, inside, the, common, envelope, it, is, slowed, down, in, the, denser, environment, this, slowed, orbital, speed, is, compensated, with, a, decrease, of, the, orbital, distance, between, the, red, dwarf, and, the, core, of, the, red, giant, the, red, dwarf, spirals, inwards, towards, the, core, and, might, merge, with, the, core, if, this, does, not, happen, and, instead, the, common, envelope, is, ejected, then, the, binary, ends, up, in, a, close, orbit, consisting, of, a, white, dwarf, and, a, red, dwarf, this, type, of, binary, is, called, a, post, common, envelope, binary, the, evolution, of, the, pceb, continues, as, the, two, dwarf, stars, orbit, closer, and, closer, due, to, magnetic, braking, and, by, releasing, gravitational, waves, the, binary, might, evolve, at, some, point, into, a, cataclysmic, variable, and, therefore, post, common, envelope, binaries, are, sometimes, called, pre, cataclysmic, variables, before, accretion, of, material, pushes, a, white, dwarf, close, to, the, chandrasekhar, limit, accreted, hydrogen, rich, material, on, the, surface, may, ignite, in, a, less, destructive, type, of, thermonuclear, explosion, powered, by, hydrogen, fusion, these, surface, explosions, can, be, repeated, as, long, as, the, white, dwarf, s, core, remains, intact, this, weaker, kind, of, repetitive, cataclysmic, phenomenon, is, called, a, classical, nova, astronomers, have, also, observed, dwarf, novae, which, have, smaller, more, frequent, luminosity, peaks, than, the, classical, novae, these, are, thought, to, be, caused, by, the, release, of, gravitational, potential, energy, when, part, of, the, accretion, disc, collapses, onto, the, star, rather, than, through, a, release, of, energy, due, to, fusion, in, general, binary, systems, with, a, white, dwarf, accreting, matter, from, a, stellar, companion, are, called, cataclysmic, variables, as, well, as, novae, and, dwarf, novae, several, other, classes, of, these, variables, are, known, including, polars, and, intermediate, polars, both, of, which, feature, highly, magnetic, white, dwarfs, both, fusion, and, accretion, powered, cataclysmic, variables, have, been, observed, to, be, x, ray, sources, other, non, pre, supernova, binaries, include, binaries, that, consist, of, a, main, sequence, star, or, giant, and, a, white, dwarf, the, binary, sirius, ab, is, probably, the, most, famous, example, white, dwarfs, can, also, exist, as, binaries, or, multiple, star, systems, that, only, consist, of, white, dwarfs, an, example, of, a, resolved, triple, white, dwarf, system, is, wd, j1953, 1019, discovered, with, gaia, dr2, data, one, interesting, field, is, the, study, of, remnant, planetary, systems, around, white, dwarfs, while, stars, are, bright, and, often, outshine, the, exoplanets, and, brown, dwarfs, that, orbit, them, the, white, dwarfs, are, faint, this, allows, astronomers, to, study, these, brown, dwarfs, or, exoplanets, in, more, detail, the, sub, brown, dwarf, around, the, white, dwarf, wd, 0806, 661, is, one, such, example, general, physics, variability, magnetic, field, frequency, observational, images
