https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thallium
thallium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, tl, and, atomic, number, 81, it, is, a, gray, post, transition, metal, that, is, not, found, free, in, nature, when, isolated, thallium, resembles, tin, but, discolors, when, exposed, to, air, chemists, william, crookes, and, claude, auguste, lamy, discovered, thallium, independently, in, 1861, in, residues, of, sulfuric, acid, production, both, used, the, newly, developed, method, of, flame, spectroscopy, in, which, thallium, produces, a, notable, green, spectral, line, thallium, from, greek, thall, s, meaning, green, shoot, or, twig, was, named, by, crookes, it, was, isolated, by, both, lamy, and, crookes, in, 1862, lamy, by, electrolysis, and, crookes, by, precipitation, and, melting, of, the, resultant, powder, crookes, exhibited, it, as, a, powder, precipitated, by, zinc, at, the, international, exhibition, which, opened, on, 1, may, that, year, thallium, tends, to, form, the, 3, and, 1, oxidation, states, the, 3, state, resembles, that, of, the, other, elements, in, group, 13, boron, aluminium, gallium, indium, however, the, 1, state, which, is, far, more, prominent, in, thallium, than, the, elements, above, it, recalls, the, chemistry, of, alkali, metals, and, thallium, i, ions, are, found, geologically, mostly, in, potassium, based, ores, and, when, ingested, are, handled, in, many, ways, like, potassium, ions, k, by, ion, pumps, in, living, cells, commercially, thallium, is, produced, not, from, potassium, ores, but, as, a, byproduct, from, refining, of, heavy, metal, sulfide, ores, approximately, 65, of, thallium, production, is, used, in, the, electronics, industry, and, the, remainder, is, used, in, the, pharmaceutical, industry, and, in, glass, manufacturing, it, is, also, used, in, infrared, detectors, the, radioisotope, thallium, 201, as, the, soluble, chloride, tlcl, is, used, in, small, amounts, as, an, agent, in, a, nuclear, medicine, scan, during, one, type, of, nuclear, cardiac, stress, test, soluble, thallium, salts, many, of, which, are, nearly, tasteless, are, highly, toxic, and, they, were, historically, used, in, rat, poisons, and, insecticides, because, of, their, nonselective, toxicity, use, of, these, compounds, has, been, restricted, or, banned, in, many, countries, thallium, poisoning, usually, results, in, hair, loss, because, of, its, historic, popularity, as, a, murder, weapon, thallium, has, gained, notoriety, as, the, poisoner, s, poison, and, inheritance, powder, alongside, arsenic, a, thallium, atom, has, 81, electrons, arranged, in, the, electron, configuration, 4f, 14, 5d, 10, 6s, 2, 6p, 1, of, these, the, three, outermost, electrons, in, the, sixth, shell, are, valence, electrons, due, to, the, inert, pair, effect, the, 6s, electron, pair, is, relativistically, stabilised, and, it, is, more, difficult, to, get, these, involved, in, chemical, bonding, than, it, is, for, the, heavier, elements, thus, very, few, electrons, are, available, for, metallic, bonding, similar, to, the, neighboring, elements, mercury, and, lead, thallium, then, like, its, congeners, is, a, soft, highly, electrically, conducting, metal, with, a, low, melting, point, of, 304, c, a, number, of, standard, electrode, potentials, depending, on, the, reaction, under, study, are, reported, for, thallium, reflecting, the, greatly, decreased, stability, of, the, 3, oxidation, state, thallium, is, the, first, element, in, group, 13, where, the, reduction, of, the, 3, oxidation, state, to, the, 1, oxidation, state, is, spontaneous, under, standard, conditions, since, bond, energies, decrease, down, the, group, with, thallium, the, energy, released, in, forming, two, additional, bonds, and, attaining, the, 3, state, is, not, always, enough, to, outweigh, the, energy, needed, to, involve, the, 6s, electrons, accordingly, thallium, i, oxide, and, hydroxide, are, more, basic, and, thallium, iii, oxide, and, hydroxide, are, more, acidic, showing, that, thallium, conforms, to, the, general, rule, of, elements, being, more, electropositive, in, their, lower, oxidation, states, thallium, is, malleable, and, sectile, enough, to, be, cut, with, a, knife, at, room, temperature, it, has, a, metallic, luster, that, when, exposed, to, air, quickly, tarnishes, to, a, bluish, gray, tinge, resembling, lead, it, may, be, preserved, by, immersion, in, oil, a, heavy, layer, of, oxide, builds, up, on, thallium, if, left, in, air, in, the, presence, of, water, thallium, hydroxide, is, formed, sulfuric, and, nitric, acids, dissolve, thallium, rapidly, to, make, the, sulfate, and, nitrate, salts, while, hydrochloric, acid, forms, an, insoluble, thallium, i, chloride, layer, thallium, has, 41, isotopes, which, have, atomic, masses, that, range, from, 176, to, 216, 203, tl, and, 205, tl, are, the, only, stable, isotopes, and, make, up, nearly, all, of, natural, thallium, the, five, short, lived, isotopes, 206, tl, through, 210, tl, inclusive, occur, in, nature, as, they, are, part, of, the, natural, decay, chains, of, heavier, elements, 204, tl, is, the, most, stable, radioisotope, with, a, half, life, of, 3, 78, years, it, is, made, by, the, neutron, activation, of, stable, thallium, in, a, nuclear, reactor, the, most, useful, radioisotope, 201, tl, half, life, 73, hours, decays, by, electron, capture, emitting, x, rays, 70, 80, kev, and, photons, of, 135, and, 167, kev, in, 10, total, abundance, therefore, it, has, good, imaging, characteristics, without, an, excessive, patient, radiation, dose, it, is, the, most, popular, isotope, used, for, thallium, nuclear, cardiac, stress, tests, thallium, iii, compounds, resemble, the, corresponding, aluminium, iii, compounds, they, are, moderately, strong, oxidizing, agents, and, are, usually, unstable, as, illustrated, by, the, positive, reduction, potential, for, the, tl, 3, tl, couple, some, mixed, valence, compounds, are, also, known, such, as, tl, 4, o, 3, and, tlcl, 2, which, contain, both, thallium, i, and, thallium, iii, thallium, iii, oxide, tl, 2, o, 3, is, a, black, solid, which, decomposes, above, 800, c, forming, the, thallium, i, oxide, and, oxygen, the, simplest, possible, thallium, compound, thallane, tlh, 3, is, too, unstable, to, exist, in, bulk, both, due, to, the, instability, of, the, 3, oxidation, state, as, well, as, poor, overlap, of, the, valence, 6s, and, 6p, orbitals, of, thallium, with, the, 1s, orbital, of, hydrogen, the, trihalides, are, more, stable, although, they, are, chemically, distinct, from, those, of, the, lighter, group, 13, elements, and, are, still, the, least, stable, in, the, whole, group, for, instance, thallium, iii, fluoride, tlf, 3, has, the, bif, 3, structure, rather, than, that, of, the, lighter, group, 13, trifluorides, and, does, not, form, the, tlf, 4, complex, anion, in, aqueous, solution, the, trichloride, and, tribromide, disproportionate, just, above, room, temperature, to, give, the, monohalides, and, thallium, triiodide, contains, the, linear, triiodide, anion, i, 3, and, is, actually, a, thallium, i, compound, thallium, iii, sesquichalcogenides, do, not, exist, the, thallium, i, halides, are, stable, in, keeping, with, the, large, size, of, the, tl, cation, the, chloride, and, bromide, have, the, caesium, chloride, structure, while, the, fluoride, and, iodide, have, distorted, sodium, chloride, structures, like, the, analogous, silver, compounds, tlcl, tlbr, and, tli, are, photosensitive, and, display, poor, solubility, in, water, the, stability, of, thallium, i, compounds, demonstrates, its, differences, from, the, rest, of, the, group, a, stable, oxide, hydroxide, and, carbonate, are, known, as, are, many, chalcogenides, the, double, salt, tl, 4, oh, 2, co, 3, has, been, shown, to, have, hydroxyl, centred, triangles, of, thallium, 2, as, a, recurring, motif, throughout, its, solid, structure, the, metalorganic, compound, thallium, ethoxide, tloet, tloc, 2, h, 5, is, a, heavy, liquid, 3, 49, g, cm, 3, m, p, 3, c, often, used, as, a, basic, and, soluble, thallium, source, in, organic, and, organometallic, chemistry, organothallium, compounds, tend, to, be, thermally, unstable, in, concordance, with, the, trend, of, decreasing, thermal, stability, down, group, 13, the, chemical, reactivity, of, the, tl, c, bond, is, also, the, lowest, in, the, group, especially, for, ionic, compounds, of, the, type, r, 2, tlx, thallium, forms, the, stable, ion, in, aqueous, solution, like, the, isoelectronic, hg, ch, 3, 2, and, 2, it, is, linear, trimethylthallium, and, triethylthallium, are, like, the, corresponding, gallium, and, indium, compounds, flammable, liquids, with, low, melting, points, like, indium, thallium, cyclopentadienyl, compounds, contain, thallium, i, in, contrast, to, gallium, iii, thallium, greek, thallos, meaning, a, green, shoot, or, twig, was, discovered, by, william, crookes, and, claude, auguste, lamy, working, independently, both, using, flame, spectroscopy, crookes, was, first, to, publish, his, findings, on, march, 30, 1861, the, name, comes, from, thallium, s, bright, green, spectral, emission, lines, derived, from, the, greek, thallos, meaning, a, green, twig, after, the, publication, of, the, improved, method, of, flame, spectroscopy, by, robert, bunsen, and, gustav, kirchhoff, and, the, discovery, of, caesium, and, rubidium, in, the, years, 1859, to, 1860, flame, spectroscopy, became, an, approved, method, to, determine, the, composition, of, minerals, and, chemical, products, crookes, and, lamy, both, started, to, use, the, new, method, crookes, used, it, to, make, spectroscopic, determinations, for, tellurium, on, selenium, compounds, deposited, in, the, lead, chamber, of, a, sulfuric, acid, production, plant, near, tilkerode, in, the, harz, mountains, he, had, obtained, the, samples, for, his, research, on, selenium, cyanide, from, august, hofmann, years, earlier, by, 1862, crookes, was, able, to, isolate, small, quantities, of, the, new, element, and, determine, the, properties, of, a, few, compounds, claude, auguste, lamy, used, a, spectrometer, that, was, similar, to, crookes, to, determine, the, composition, of, a, selenium, containing, substance, which, was, deposited, during, the, production, of, sulfuric, acid, from, pyrite, he, also, noticed, the, new, green, line, in, the, spectra, and, concluded, that, a, new, element, was, present, lamy, had, received, this, material, from, the, sulfuric, acid, plant, of, his, friend, fr, d, ric, kuhlmann, and, this, by, product, was, available, in, large, quantities, lamy, started, to, isolate, the, new, element, from, that, source, the, fact, that, lamy, was, able, to, work, ample, quantities, of, thallium, enabled, him, to, determine, the, properties, of, several, compounds, and, in, addition, he, prepared, a, small, ingot, of, metallic, thallium, which, he, prepared, by, remelting, thallium, he, had, obtained, by, electrolysis, of, thallium, salts, as, both, scientists, discovered, thallium, independently, and, a, large, part, of, the, work, especially, the, isolation, of, the, metallic, thallium, was, done, by, lamy, crookes, tried, to, secure, his, own, priority, on, the, work, lamy, was, awarded, a, medal, at, the, international, exhibition, in, london, 1862, for, the, discovery, of, a, new, and, abundant, source, of, thallium, and, after, heavy, protest, crookes, also, received, a, medal, thallium, for, the, discovery, of, the, new, element, the, controversy, between, both, scientists, continued, through, 1862, and, 1863, most, of, the, discussion, ended, after, crookes, was, elected, fellow, of, the, royal, society, in, june, 1863, the, dominant, use, of, thallium, was, the, use, as, poison, for, rodents, after, several, accidents, the, use, as, poison, was, banned, in, the, united, states, by, presidential, executive, order, 11643, in, february, 1972, in, subsequent, years, several, other, countries, also, banned, its, use, thallium, concentration, in, the, earth, s, crust, is, estimated, to, be, 0, 7, mg, kg, mostly, in, association, with, potassium, based, minerals, in, clays, soils, and, granites, the, major, source, of, thallium, for, practical, purposes, is, the, trace, amount, that, is, found, in, copper, lead, zinc, and, other, heavy, metal, sulfide, ores, thallium, is, found, in, the, minerals, crookesite, tlcu, 7, se, 4, hutchinsonite, tlpbas, 5, s, 9, and, lor, ndite, tlass, 2, thallium, also, occurs, as, a, trace, element, in, iron, pyrite, and, thallium, is, extracted, as, a, by, product, of, roasting, this, mineral, for, the, production, of, sulfuric, acid, thallium, can, also, be, obtained, from, the, smelting, of, lead, and, zinc, ores, manganese, nodules, found, on, the, ocean, floor, contain, some, thallium, in, addition, several, other, thallium, minerals, containing, 16, to, 60, thallium, occur, in, nature, as, complexes, of, sulfides, or, selenides, that, primarily, contain, antimony, arsenic, copper, lead, and, silver, these, minerals, are, rare, and, have, had, no, commercial, importance, as, sources, of, thallium, the, allchar, deposit, in, southern, north, macedonia, was, the, only, area, where, thallium, was, actively, mined, this, deposit, still, contains, an, estimated, 500, tonnes, of, thallium, and, it, is, a, source, for, several, rare, thallium, minerals, for, example, lor, ndite, the, united, states, geological, survey, usgs, estimates, that, the, annual, worldwide, production, of, thallium, is, 10, metric, tonnes, as, a, by, product, from, the, smelting, of, copper, zinc, and, lead, ores, thallium, is, either, extracted, from, the, dusts, from, the, smelter, flues, or, from, residues, such, as, slag, that, are, collected, at, the, end, of, the, smelting, process, the, raw, materials, used, for, thallium, production, contain, large, amounts, of, other, materials, and, therefore, a, purification, is, the, first, step, the, thallium, is, leached, either, by, the, use, of, an, alkali, or, sulfuric, acid, from, the, material, the, thallium, is, precipitated, several, times, from, the, solution, to, remove, impurities, at, the, end, it, is, converted, to, thallium, sulfate, and, the, thallium, is, extracted, by, electrolysis, on, platinum, or, stainless, steel, plates, the, production, of, thallium, decreased, by, about, 33, in, the, period, from, 1995, to, 2009, from, about, 15, metric, tonnes, to, about, 10, tonnes, since, there, are, several, small, deposits, or, ores, with, relatively, high, thallium, content, it, would, be, possible, to, increase, the, production, if, a, new, application, such, as, a, thallium, containing, high, temperature, superconductor, becomes, practical, for, widespread, use, outside, of, the, laboratory, the, odorless, and, tasteless, thallium, sulfate, was, once, widely, used, as, rat, poison, and, ant, killer, since, 1972, this, use, has, been, prohibited, in, the, united, states, due, to, safety, concerns, many, other, countries, followed, this, example, thallium, salts, were, used, in, the, treatment, of, ringworm, other, skin, infections, and, to, reduce, the, night, sweating, of, tuberculosis, patients, this, use, has, been, limited, due, to, their, narrow, therapeutic, index, and, the, development, of, improved, medicines, for, these, conditions, thallium, i, bromide, and, thallium, i, iodide, crystals, have, been, used, as, infrared, optical, materials, because, they, are, harder, than, other, common, infrared, optics, and, because, they, have, transmission, at, significantly, longer, wavelengths, the, trade, name, krs, 5, refers, to, this, material, thallium, i, oxide, has, been, used, to, manufacture, glasses, that, have, a, high, index, of, refraction, combined, with, sulfur, or, selenium, and, arsenic, thallium, has, been, used, in, the, production, of, high, density, glasses, that, have, low, melting, points, in, the, range, of, 125, and, 150, celsius, these, glasses, have, room, temperature, properties, that, are, similar, to, ordinary, glasses, and, are, durable, insoluble, in, water, and, have, unique, refractive, indices, thallium, i, sulfide, s, electrical, conductivity, changes, with, exposure, to, infrared, light, making, this, compound, useful, in, photoresistors, thallium, selenide, has, been, used, in, bolometers, for, infrared, detection, doping, selenium, semiconductors, with, thallium, improves, their, performance, thus, it, is, used, in, trace, amounts, in, selenium, rectifiers, another, application, of, thallium, doping, is, the, sodium, iodide, and, cesium, iodide, crystals, in, gamma, radiation, detection, devices, in, these, the, sodium, iodide, crystals, are, doped, with, a, small, amount, of, thallium, to, improve, their, efficiency, as, scintillation, generators, some, of, the, electrodes, in, dissolved, oxygen, analyzers, contain, thallium, research, activity, with, thallium, is, ongoing, to, develop, high, temperature, superconducting, materials, for, such, applications, as, magnetic, resonance, imaging, storage, of, magnetic, energy, magnetic, propulsion, and, electric, power, generation, and, transmission, the, research, in, applications, started, after, the, discovery, of, the, first, thallium, barium, calcium, copper, oxide, superconductor, in, 1988, thallium, cuprate, superconductors, have, been, discovered, that, have, transition, temperatures, above, 120, k, some, mercury, doped, thallium, cuprate, superconductors, have, transition, temperatures, above, 130, k, at, ambient, pressure, nearly, as, high, as, the, world, record, holding, mercury, cuprates, before, the, widespread, application, of, technetium, 99m, in, nuclear, medicine, the, radioactive, isotope, thallium, 201, with, a, half, life, of, 73, hours, was, the, main, substance, for, nuclear, cardiography, the, nuclide, is, still, used, for, stress, tests, for, risk, stratification, in, patients, with, coronary, artery, disease, cad, this, isotope, of, thallium, can, be, generated, using, a, transportable, generator, which, is, similar, to, the, technetium, 99m, generator, the, generator, contains, lead, 201, half, life, 9, 33, hours, which, decays, by, electron, capture, to, thallium, 201, the, lead, 201, can, be, produced, in, a, cyclotron, by, the, bombardment, of, thallium, with, protons, or, deuterons, by, the, p, 3n, and, d, 4n, reactions, a, thallium, stress, test, is, a, form, of, scintigraphy, in, which, the, amount, of, thallium, in, tissues, correlates, with, tissue, blood, supply, viable, cardiac, cells, have, normal, na, k, ion, exchange, pumps, the, tl, cation, binds, the, k, pumps, and, is, transported, into, the, cells, exercise, or, dipyridamole, induces, widening, vasodilation, of, arteries, in, the, body, this, produces, coronary, steal, by, areas, where, arteries, are, maximally, dilated, areas, of, infarct, or, ischemic, tissue, will, remain, cold, pre, and, post, stress, thallium, may, indicate, areas, that, will, benefit, from, myocardial, revascularization, redistribution, indicates, the, existence, of, coronary, steal, and, the, presence, of, ischemic, coronary, artery, disease, a, mercury, thallium, alloy, which, forms, a, eutectic, at, 8, 5, thallium, is, reported, to, freeze, at, 60, c, some, 20, c, below, the, freezing, point, of, mercury, this, alloy, is, used, in, thermometers, and, low, temperature, switches, in, organic, synthesis, thallium, iii, salts, as, thallium, trinitrate, or, triacetate, are, useful, reagents, for, performing, different, transformations, in, aromatics, ketones, and, olefins, among, others, thallium, is, a, constituent, of, the, alloy, in, the, anode, plates, of, magnesium, seawater, batteries, soluble, thallium, salts, are, added, to, gold, plating, baths, to, increase, the, speed, of, plating, and, to, reduce, grain, size, within, the, gold, layer, a, saturated, solution, of, equal, parts, of, thallium, i, formate, tl, hco, 2, and, thallium, i, malonate, tl, c, 3, h, 3, o, 4, in, water, is, known, as, clerici, solution, it, is, a, mobile, odorless, liquid, which, changes, from, yellowish, to, colorless, upon, reducing, the, concentration, of, the, thallium, salts, with, a, density, of, 4, 25, g, cm, 3, at, 20, c, clerici, solution, is, one, of, the, heaviest, aqueous, solutions, known, it, was, used, in, the, 20th, century, for, measuring, the, density, of, minerals, by, the, flotation, method, but, its, use, has, discontinued, due, to, the, high, toxicity, and, corrosiveness, of, the, solution, thallium, iodide, is, frequently, used, as, an, additive, in, metal, halide, lamps, often, together, with, one, or, two, halides, of, other, metals, it, allows, optimization, of, the, lamp, temperature, and, color, rendering, and, shifts, the, spectral, output, to, the, green, region, which, is, useful, for, underwater, lighting, thallium, and, its, compounds, are, extremely, toxic, with, numerous, recorded, cases, of, fatal, thallium, poisoning, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, has, set, the, legal, limit, permissible, exposure, limit, for, thallium, exposure, in, the, workplace, as, 0, 1, mg, m, 2, skin, exposure, over, an, eight, hour, workday, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, also, set, a, recommended, exposure, limit, rel, of, 0, 1, mg, m, 2, skin, exposure, over, an, eight, hour, workday, at, levels, of, 15, mg, m, 2, thallium, is, immediately, dangerous, to, life, and, health, contact, with, skin, is, dangerous, and, adequate, ventilation, is, necessary, when, melting, this, metal, thallium, i, compounds, have, a, high, aqueous, solubility, and, are, readily, absorbed, through, the, skin, and, care, should,
