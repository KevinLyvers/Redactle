a, day, is, the, time, period, of, a, full, rotation, of, the, earth, with, respect, to, the, sun, on, average, this, is, 24, hours, 86, 400, seconds, as, a, day, passes, at, a, given, location, it, experiences, morning, noon, afternoon, evening, and, night, this, daily, cycle, drives, circadian, rhythms, in, many, organisms, which, are, vital, to, many, life, processes, a, collection, of, sequential, days, is, organized, into, calendars, as, dates, almost, always, into, weeks, months, and, years, a, solar, calendar, organizes, dates, based, on, the, sun, s, annual, cycle, giving, consistent, start, dates, for, the, four, seasons, from, year, to, year, a, lunar, calendar, organizes, dates, based, on, the, moon, s, lunar, phase, in, common, usage, a, day, starts, at, midnight, written, as, 00, 00, or, 12, 00, am, in, 24, or, 12, hour, clocks, respectively, because, the, time, of, midnight, varies, between, locations, time, zones, are, set, up, to, facilitate, the, use, of, a, uniform, standard, time, other, conventions, are, sometimes, used, for, example, the, jewish, religious, calendar, counts, days, from, sunset, to, sunset, so, the, jewish, sabbath, begins, at, sundown, on, friday, in, astronomy, a, day, begins, at, noon, so, that, observations, throughout, a, single, night, are, recorded, as, happening, on, the, same, day, in, specific, applications, the, definition, of, a, day, is, slightly, modified, such, as, in, the, si, day, exactly, 86, 400, seconds, used, for, computers, and, standards, keeping, local, mean, time, accounting, of, the, earth, s, natural, fluctuation, of, a, solar, day, and, stellar, day, and, sidereal, day, using, the, celestial, sphere, used, for, astronomy, in, most, countries, outside, of, the, tropics, daylight, saving, time, is, practiced, and, each, year, there, will, be, one, 23, hour, civil, day, and, one, 25, hour, civil, day, due, to, slight, variations, in, the, rotation, of, the, earth, there, are, rare, times, when, a, leap, second, will, get, inserted, at, the, end, of, a, utc, day, and, so, while, almost, all, days, have, a, duration, of, 86, 400, seconds, there, are, these, exceptional, cases, of, a, day, with, 86, 401, seconds, in, the, half, century, spanning, 1972, through, 2022, there, have, been, a, total, of, 27, leap, seconds, that, have, been, inserted, so, roughly, once, every, other, year, the, term, comes, from, the, old, english, term, d, d, j, with, its, cognates, such, as, dagur, in, icelandic, tag, in, german, and, dag, in, norwegian, danish, swedish, and, dutch, all, stemming, from, a, proto, germanic, root, dagaz, several, definitions, of, this, universal, human, concept, are, used, according, to, context, need, and, convenience, besides, the, day, of, 24, hours, 86, 400, seconds, the, word, day, is, used, for, several, different, spans, of, time, based, on, the, rotation, of, the, earth, around, its, axis, an, important, one, is, the, solar, day, the, time, it, takes, for, the, sun, to, return, to, its, culmination, point, its, highest, point, in, the, sky, due, to, an, orbit, s, eccentricity, the, sun, resides, in, one, of, the, orbit, s, foci, instead, of, the, middle, consequently, due, to, kepler, s, second, law, the, planet, travels, at, different, speeds, at, various, positions, in, its, orbit, and, thus, a, solar, day, is, not, the, same, length, of, time, throughout, the, orbital, year, because, the, earth, moves, along, an, eccentric, orbit, around, the, sun, while, the, earth, spins, on, an, inclined, axis, this, period, can, be, up, to, 7, 9, seconds, more, than, or, less, than, 24, hours, in, recent, decades, the, average, length, of, a, solar, day, on, earth, has, been, about, 86, 400, 002, seconds, 24, 000, 000, 6, hours, there, are, currently, about, 365, 2421875, solar, days, in, one, mean, tropical, year, ancient, custom, has, a, new, day, starting, at, either, the, rising, or, setting, of, the, sun, on, the, local, horizon, italian, reckoning, for, example, being, 24, hours, from, sunset, old, style, the, exact, moment, of, and, the, interval, between, two, sunrises, or, sunsets, depends, on, the, geographical, position, longitude, and, latitude, as, well, as, altitude, and, the, time, of, year, as, indicated, by, ancient, hemispherical, sundials, a, more, constant, day, can, be, defined, by, the, sun, passing, through, the, local, meridian, which, happens, at, local, noon, upper, culmination, or, midnight, lower, culmination, the, exact, moment, is, dependent, on, the, geographical, longitude, and, to, a, lesser, extent, on, the, time, of, the, year, the, length, of, such, a, day, is, nearly, constant, 24, hours, 30, seconds, this, is, the, time, as, indicated, by, modern, sundials, a, further, improvement, defines, a, fictitious, mean, sun, that, moves, with, constant, speed, along, the, celestial, equator, the, speed, is, the, same, as, the, average, speed, of, the, real, sun, but, this, removes, the, variation, over, a, year, as, the, earth, moves, along, its, orbit, around, the, sun, due, to, both, its, velocity, and, its, axial, tilt, in, terms, of, earth, s, rotation, the, average, day, length, is, about, 360, 9856, a, day, lasts, for, more, than, 360, of, rotation, because, of, the, earth, s, revolution, around, the, sun, with, a, full, year, being, slightly, more, than, 360, days, the, earth, s, daily, orbit, around, the, sun, is, slightly, less, than, 1, so, the, day, is, slightly, less, than, 361, of, rotation, elsewhere, in, the, solar, system, or, other, parts, of, the, universe, a, day, is, a, full, rotation, of, other, large, astronomical, objects, with, respect, to, its, star, for, civil, purposes, a, common, clock, time, is, typically, defined, for, an, entire, region, based, on, the, local, mean, solar, time, at, a, central, meridian, such, time, zones, began, to, be, adopted, about, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, when, railroads, with, regularly, occurring, schedules, came, into, use, with, most, major, countries, having, adopted, them, by, 1929, as, of, 2015, throughout, the, world, 40, such, zones, are, now, in, use, the, central, zone, from, which, all, others, are, defined, as, offsets, is, known, as, utc, 00, which, uses, coordinated, universal, time, utc, the, most, common, convention, starts, the, civil, day, at, midnight, this, is, near, the, time, of, the, lower, culmination, of, the, sun, on, the, central, meridian, of, the, time, zone, such, a, day, may, be, called, a, calendar, day, a, day, is, commonly, divided, into, 24, hours, with, each, hour, being, made, up, of, 60, minutes, and, each, minute, composed, of, 60, seconds, a, sidereal, day, or, stellar, day, is, the, span, of, time, it, takes, for, the, earth, to, make, one, entire, rotation, with, respect, to, the, celestial, background, or, a, distant, star, assumed, to, be, fixed, measuring, a, day, as, such, is, used, in, astronomy, a, sidereal, day, is, about, 4, minutes, less, than, a, solar, day, of, 24, hours, 23, hours, 56, minutes, and, 4, 09, seconds, or, 0, 99726968, of, a, solar, day, of, 24, hours, there, are, about, 366, 2422, stellar, days, in, one, mean, tropical, year, one, stellar, day, more, than, the, number, of, solar, days, besides, a, stellar, day, on, earth, other, bodies, in, the, solar, system, have, day, times, the, durations, of, these, being, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, a, day, not, an, official, unit, but, is, accepted, for, use, with, si, a, day, with, symbol, d, is, defined, using, si, units, as, 86, 400, seconds, the, second, is, the, base, unit, of, time, in, si, units, in, 1967, 68, during, the, 13th, cgpm, resolution, 1, the, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, bipm, redefined, a, second, as, the, duration, of, 9, 192, 631, 770, periods, of, the, radiation, corresponding, to, the, transition, between, two, hyperfine, levels, of, the, ground, state, of, the, caesium, 133, atom, this, makes, the, si, based, day, last, exactly, 794, 243, 384, 928, 000, of, those, periods, various, decimal, or, metric, time, proposals, have, been, made, but, do, not, redefine, the, day, and, use, the, day, or, sidereal, day, as, a, base, unit, metric, time, uses, metric, prefixes, to, keep, time, it, uses, the, day, as, the, base, unit, and, smaller, units, being, fractions, of, a, day, a, metric, hour, deci, is, 1, 10, of, a, day, a, metric, minute, milli, is, 1, 1000, of, a, day, etc, similarly, in, decimal, time, the, length, of, a, day, is, static, to, normal, time, a, day, is, also, split, into, 10, hours, and, 10, days, comprise, a, d, cade, the, equivalent, of, a, week, 3, d, cades, make, a, month, 35, various, decimal, time, proposals, which, do, not, redefine, the, day, henri, de, sarrauton, s, proposal, kept, days, and, subdivided, hours, into, 100, minutes, 42, in, mendiz, bal, y, tamborel, s, proposal, the, sidereal, day, was, the, basic, unit, with, subdivisions, made, upon, it, 42, 43, and, rey, pailhade, s, proposal, divided, the, day, 100, c, s, 42, the, word, refers, to, various, similarly, defined, ideas, such, as, mainly, due, to, tidal, deceleration, the, moon, s, gravitational, pull, slowing, down, the, earth, s, rotation, the, earth, s, rotational, period, is, slowing, because, of, the, way, the, second, is, defined, the, mean, length, of, a, solar, day, is, now, about, 86, 400, 002, seconds, and, is, increasing, by, about, 2, milliseconds, per, century, since, the, rotation, rate, of, the, earth, is, slowing, the, length, of, a, si, second, fell, out, of, sync, with, a, second, derived, from, the, rotational, period, this, arose, the, need, for, leap, seconds, which, insert, extra, seconds, into, coordinated, universal, time, utc, although, typically, 86, 400, si, seconds, in, duration, a, civil, day, can, be, either, 86, 401, or, 86, 399, si, seconds, long, on, such, a, day, other, than, the, two, millisecond, variation, from, tidal, deceleration, other, factors, minutely, affect, the, day, s, length, which, creates, an, irregularity, in, the, placement, of, leap, seconds, leap, seconds, are, announced, in, advance, by, the, international, earth, rotation, and, reference, systems, service, iers, which, measures, the, earth, s, rotation, and, determines, whether, a, leap, second, is, necessary, discovered, by, paleontologist, john, w, wells, the, day, lengths, of, geological, periods, have, been, estimated, by, measuring, sedimentation, rings, in, coral, fossils, due, to, some, biological, systems, being, affected, by, the, tide, the, length, of, a, day, at, the, earth, s, formation, is, estimated, at, 6, hours, arbab, i, arbab, plotted, day, lengths, over, time, and, found, a, curved, line, arbab, attributed, this, to, the, change, of, water, volume, present, affecting, earth, s, rotation, for, most, diurnal, animals, the, day, naturally, begins, at, dawn, and, ends, at, sunset, humans, with, their, cultural, norms, and, scientific, knowledge, have, employed, several, different, conceptions, of, the, day, s, boundaries, in, the, hebrew, bible, genesis, 1, 5, defines, a, day, in, terms, of, evening, and, morning, before, recounting, the, creation, of, the, sun, to, illuminate, it, and, god, called, the, light, day, and, the, darkness, he, called, night, and, the, evening, and, the, morning, were, the, first, day, the, jewish, day, begins, at, either, sunset, or, nightfall, when, three, second, magnitude, stars, appear, medieval, europe, also, followed, this, tradition, known, as, florentine, reckoning, in, this, system, a, reference, like, two, hours, into, the, day, meant, two, hours, after, sunset, and, thus, times, during, the, evening, need, to, be, shifted, back, one, calendar, day, in, modern, reckoning, days, such, as, christmas, eve, halloween, all, hallows, eve, and, the, eve, of, saint, agnes, are, remnants, of, the, older, pattern, when, holidays, began, during, the, prior, evening, the, common, convention, among, the, ancient, romans, ancient, chinese, and, in, modern, times, is, for, the, civil, day, to, begin, at, midnight, i, e, 00, 00, and, to, last, a, full, 24, hours, until, 24, 00, i, e, 00, 00, of, the, next, day, in, ancient, egypt, the, day, was, reckoned, from, sunrise, to, sunrise, prior, to, 1926, turkey, had, two, time, systems, turkish, counting, the, hours, from, sunset, and, french, counting, the, hours, from, midnight, humans, have, divided, the, day, in, rough, periods, which, can, have, cultural, implications, and, other, effects, on, humans, biological, processes, the, parts, of, the, day, do, not, have, set, times, they, can, vary, by, lifestyle, or, hours, of, daylight, in, a, given, place, daytime, is, the, part, of, the, day, during, which, sunlight, directly, reaches, the, ground, assuming, that, there, are, no, obstacles, the, length, of, daytime, averages, slightly, more, than, half, of, the, 24, hour, day, two, effects, make, daytime, on, average, longer, than, night, the, sun, is, not, a, point, but, has, an, apparent, size, of, about, 32, minutes, of, arc, additionally, the, atmosphere, refracts, sunlight, in, such, a, way, that, some, of, it, reaches, the, ground, even, when, the, sun, is, below, the, horizon, by, about, 34, minutes, of, arc, so, the, first, light, reaches, the, ground, when, the, centre, of, the, sun, is, still, below, the, horizon, by, about, 50, minutes, of, arc, thus, daytime, is, on, average, around, 7, minutes, longer, than, 12, hours, daytime, is, further, divided, into, morning, afternoon, and, evening, morning, occurs, between, sunrise, and, noon, afternoon, occurs, between, noon, and, sunset, or, between, noon, and, the, start, of, evening, this, period, of, time, sees, human, s, highest, body, temperature, an, increase, of, traffic, collisions, and, a, decrease, of, productivity, evening, begins, around, 5, or, 6, pm, or, when, the, sun, sets, and, ends, when, one, goes, to, bed, twilight, is, the, period, before, sunrise, and, after, sunset, in, which, there, is, natural, light, but, no, direct, sunlight, the, morning, twilight, begins, at, dawn, and, ends, at, sunrise, while, the, evening, twilight, begins, at, sunset, and, ends, at, dusk, both, periods, of, twilight, can, be, divided, into, civil, twilight, nautical, twilight, and, astronomical, twilight, civil, twilight, is, when, the, sun, is, up, to, 6, degrees, below, the, horizon, nautical, when, it, is, up, to, 12, degrees, below, and, astronomical, when, it, is, up, to, 18, degrees, below, night, is, the, period, in, which, the, sky, is, dark, the, period, between, dusk, and, dawn, when, no, light, from, the, sun, is, visible, light, pollution, during, night, can, impact, human, and, animal, life, for, example, by, disrupting, sleep
