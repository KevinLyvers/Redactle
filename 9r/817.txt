in, nuclear, physics, and, particle, physics, the, strong, interaction, also, called, the, strong, force, or, strong, nuclear, force, is, a, fundamental, interaction, that, confines, quarks, into, protons, neutrons, and, other, hadron, particles, the, strong, interaction, also, binds, neutrons, and, protons, to, create, atomic, nuclei, where, it, is, called, the, nuclear, force, most, of, the, mass, of, a, proton, or, neutron, is, the, result, of, the, strong, interaction, energy, the, individual, quarks, provide, only, about, 1, of, the, mass, of, a, proton, at, the, range, of, 10, 15, m, 1, femtometer, slightly, more, than, the, radius, of, a, nucleon, the, strong, force, is, approximately, 100, times, as, strong, as, electromagnetism, 10, 6, times, as, strong, as, the, weak, interaction, and, 10, 38, times, as, strong, as, gravitation, in, the, context, of, atomic, nuclei, the, force, binds, protons, and, neutrons, together, to, form, a, nucleus, and, is, called, the, nuclear, force, or, residual, strong, force, because, the, force, is, mediated, by, massive, short, lived, mesons, on, this, scale, the, residual, strong, interaction, obeys, a, distance, dependent, behavior, between, nucleons, that, is, quite, different, from, when, it, is, acting, to, bind, quarks, within, hadrons, there, are, also, differences, in, the, binding, energies, of, the, nuclear, force, with, regard, to, nuclear, fusion, versus, nuclear, fission, nuclear, fusion, accounts, for, most, energy, production, in, the, sun, and, other, stars, nuclear, fission, allows, for, decay, of, radioactive, elements, and, isotopes, although, it, is, often, mediated, by, the, weak, interaction, artificially, the, energy, associated, with, the, nuclear, force, is, partially, released, in, nuclear, power, and, nuclear, weapons, both, in, uranium, or, plutonium, based, fission, weapons, and, in, fusion, weapons, like, the, hydrogen, bomb, before, 1971, physicists, were, uncertain, as, to, how, the, atomic, nucleus, was, bound, together, it, was, known, that, the, nucleus, was, composed, of, protons, and, neutrons, and, that, protons, possessed, positive, electric, charge, while, neutrons, were, electrically, neutral, by, the, understanding, of, physics, at, that, time, positive, charges, would, repel, one, another, and, the, positively, charged, protons, should, cause, the, nucleus, to, fly, apart, however, this, was, never, observed, new, physics, was, needed, to, explain, this, phenomenon, a, stronger, attractive, force, was, postulated, to, explain, how, the, atomic, nucleus, was, bound, despite, the, protons, mutual, electromagnetic, repulsion, this, hypothesized, force, was, called, the, strong, force, which, was, believed, to, be, a, fundamental, force, that, acted, on, the, protons, and, neutrons, that, make, up, the, nucleus, in, 1964, murray, gell, mann, and, separately, george, zweig, proposed, that, baryons, which, include, protons, and, neutrons, and, mesons, were, composed, of, elementary, particles, zweig, called, the, elementary, particles, aces, while, gell, mann, called, them, quarks, the, theory, came, to, be, called, the, quark, model, the, strong, attraction, between, nucleons, was, the, side, effect, of, a, more, fundamental, force, that, bound, the, quarks, together, into, protons, and, neutrons, the, theory, of, quantum, chromodynamics, explains, that, quarks, carry, what, is, called, a, color, charge, although, it, has, no, relation, to, visible, color, quarks, with, unlike, color, charge, attract, one, another, as, a, result, of, the, strong, interaction, and, the, particle, that, mediates, this, was, called, the, gluon, the, strong, interaction, is, observable, at, two, ranges, and, mediated, by, different, force, carriers, in, each, one, on, a, scale, less, than, about, 0, 8, fm, roughly, the, radius, of, a, nucleon, the, force, is, carried, by, gluons, and, holds, quarks, together, to, form, protons, neutrons, and, other, hadrons, on, a, larger, scale, up, to, about, 3, fm, the, force, is, carried, by, mesons, and, binds, nucleons, protons, and, neutrons, together, to, form, the, nucleus, of, an, atom, in, the, former, context, it, is, often, known, as, the, color, force, and, is, so, strong, that, if, hadrons, are, struck, by, high, energy, particles, they, produce, jets, of, massive, particles, instead, of, emitting, their, constituents, quarks, and, gluons, as, freely, moving, particles, this, property, of, the, strong, force, is, called, color, confinement, the, word, strong, is, used, since, the, strong, interaction, is, the, strongest, of, the, four, fundamental, forces, at, a, distance, of, 10, 15, m, its, strength, is, around, 100, times, that, of, the, electromagnetic, force, some, 10, 6, times, as, great, as, that, of, the, weak, force, and, about, 10, 38, times, that, of, gravitation, the, strong, force, is, described, by, quantum, chromodynamics, qcd, a, part, of, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, mathematically, qcd, is, a, non, abelian, gauge, theory, based, on, a, local, gauge, symmetry, group, called, su, 3, the, force, carrier, particle, of, the, strong, interaction, is, the, gluon, a, massless, gauge, boson, gluons, are, thought, to, interact, with, quarks, and, other, gluons, by, way, of, a, type, of, charge, called, color, charge, color, charge, is, analogous, to, electromagnetic, charge, but, it, comes, in, three, types, red, green, and, blue, rather, than, one, which, results, in, different, rules, of, behavior, these, rules, are, described, by, quantum, chromodynamics, qcd, the, theory, of, quark, gluon, interactions, unlike, the, photon, in, electromagnetism, which, is, neutral, the, gluon, carries, a, color, charge, quarks, and, gluons, are, the, only, fundamental, particles, that, carry, non, vanishing, color, charge, and, hence, they, participate, in, strong, interactions, only, with, each, other, the, strong, force, is, the, expression, of, the, gluon, interaction, with, other, quark, and, gluon, particles, all, quarks, and, gluons, in, qcd, interact, with, each, other, through, the, strong, force, the, strength, of, interaction, is, parameterized, by, the, strong, coupling, constant, this, strength, is, modified, by, the, gauge, color, charge, of, the, particle, a, group, theoretical, property, the, strong, force, acts, between, quarks, unlike, all, other, forces, electromagnetic, weak, and, gravitational, the, strong, force, does, not, diminish, in, strength, with, increasing, distance, between, pairs, of, quarks, after, a, limiting, distance, about, the, size, of, a, hadron, has, been, reached, it, remains, at, a, strength, of, about, 10, 000, n, no, matter, how, much, farther, the, distance, between, the, quarks, 164, as, the, separation, between, the, quarks, grows, the, energy, added, to, the, pair, creates, new, pairs, of, matching, quarks, between, the, original, two, hence, it, is, impossible, to, isolate, quarks, the, explanation, is, that, the, amount, of, work, done, against, a, force, of, 10, 000, n, is, enough, to, create, particle, antiparticle, pairs, within, a, very, short, distance, the, energy, added, to, the, system, by, pulling, two, quarks, apart, would, create, a, pair, of, new, quarks, that, will, pair, up, with, the, original, ones, in, qcd, this, phenomenon, is, called, color, confinement, as, a, result, only, hadrons, not, individual, free, quarks, can, be, observed, the, failure, of, all, experiments, that, have, searched, for, free, quarks, is, considered, to, be, evidence, of, this, phenomenon, the, elementary, quark, and, gluon, particles, involved, in, a, high, energy, collision, are, not, directly, observable, the, interaction, produces, jets, of, newly, created, hadrons, that, are, observable, those, hadrons, are, created, as, a, manifestation, of, mass, energy, equivalence, when, sufficient, energy, is, deposited, into, a, quark, quark, bond, as, when, a, quark, in, one, proton, is, struck, by, a, very, fast, quark, of, another, impacting, proton, during, a, particle, accelerator, experiment, however, quark, gluon, plasmas, have, been, observed, while, color, confinement, implies, that, the, strong, force, acts, without, distance, diminishment, between, pairs, of, quarks, in, compact, collections, of, bound, quarks, hadrons, at, distances, approaching, or, greater, than, the, radius, of, a, proton, a, residual, force, described, below, remains, it, manifests, as, a, force, between, the, colorless, hadrons, and, is, known, as, the, nuclear, force, or, residual, strong, force, and, historically, as, the, strong, nuclear, force, the, nuclear, force, acts, between, hadrons, known, as, mesons, and, baryons, this, residual, strong, force, acting, indirectly, transmits, gluons, that, form, part, of, the, virtual, and, mesons, which, in, turn, transmit, the, force, between, nucleons, that, holds, the, nucleus, beyond, hydrogen, 1, nucleus, together, the, residual, strong, force, is, thus, a, minor, residuum, of, the, strong, force, that, binds, quarks, together, into, protons, and, neutrons, this, same, force, is, much, weaker, between, neutrons, and, protons, because, it, is, mostly, neutralized, within, them, in, the, same, way, that, electromagnetic, forces, between, neutral, atoms, van, der, waals, forces, are, much, weaker, than, the, electromagnetic, forces, that, hold, electrons, in, association, with, the, nucleus, forming, the, atoms, unlike, the, strong, force, the, residual, strong, force, diminishes, with, distance, and, does, so, rapidly, the, decrease, is, approximately, as, a, negative, exponential, power, of, distance, though, there, is, no, simple, expression, known, for, this, see, yukawa, potential, the, rapid, decrease, with, distance, of, the, attractive, residual, force, and, the, less, rapid, decrease, of, the, repulsive, electromagnetic, force, acting, between, protons, within, a, nucleus, causes, the, instability, of, larger, atomic, nuclei, such, as, all, those, with, atomic, numbers, larger, than, 82, the, element, lead, although, the, nuclear, force, is, weaker, than, the, strong, interaction, itself, it, is, still, highly, energetic, transitions, produce, gamma, rays, the, mass, of, a, nucleus, is, significantly, different, from, the, summed, masses, of, the, individual, nucleons, this, mass, defect, is, due, to, the, potential, energy, associated, with, the, nuclear, force, differences, between, mass, defects, power, nuclear, fusion, and, nuclear, fission, the, so, called, grand, unified, theories, gut, aim, to, describe, the, strong, interaction, and, the, electroweak, interaction, as, aspects, of, a, single, force, similarly, to, how, the, electromagnetic, and, weak, interactions, were, unified, by, the, glashow, weinberg, salam, model, into, electroweak, interaction, the, strong, interaction, has, a, property, called, asymptotic, freedom, wherein, the, strength, of, the, strong, force, diminishes, at, higher, energies, or, temperatures, the, theorized, energy, where, its, strength, becomes, equal, to, the, electroweak, interaction, is, the, grand, unification, energy, however, no, grand, unified, theory, has, yet, been, successfully, formulated, to, describe, this, process, and, grand, unification, remains, an, unsolved, problem, in, physics, if, gut, is, correct, after, the, big, bang, and, during, the, electroweak, epoch, of, the, universe, the, electroweak, force, separated, from, the, strong, force, accordingly, a, grand, unification, epoch, is, hypothesized, to, have, existed, prior, to, this
