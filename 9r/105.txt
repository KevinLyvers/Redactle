uranus, is, the, seventh, planet, from, the, sun, it, is, a, gaseous, cyan, coloured, ice, giant, most, of, the, planet, is, made, of, water, ammonia, and, methane, in, a, supercritical, phase, of, matter, which, astronomy, calls, ice, or, volatiles, the, planet, s, atmosphere, has, a, complex, layered, cloud, structure, and, has, the, lowest, minimum, temperature, 49, k, 224, c, 371, f, of, all, the, solar, system, s, planets, it, has, a, marked, axial, tilt, of, 82, 23, with, a, retrograde, rotation, period, of, 17, hours, and, 14, minutes, this, means, that, in, an, 84, earth, year, orbital, period, around, the, sun, its, poles, get, around, 42, years, of, continuous, sunlight, followed, by, 42, years, of, continuous, darkness, uranus, has, the, third, largest, diameter, and, fourth, largest, mass, among, the, solar, system, s, planets, based, on, current, models, inside, its, volatile, mantle, layer, is, a, rocky, core, and, surrounding, it, is, a, thick, hydrogen, and, helium, atmosphere, trace, amounts, of, hydrocarbons, thought, to, be, produced, via, hydrolysis, and, carbon, monoxide, along, with, carbon, dioxide, thought, to, have, been, originated, from, comets, have, been, detected, in, the, upper, atmosphere, there, are, many, unexplained, climate, phenomena, in, uranus, s, atmosphere, such, as, its, peak, wind, speed, of, 900, km, h, 560, mph, variations, in, its, polar, cap, and, its, erratic, cloud, formation, the, planet, also, has, very, low, internal, heat, compared, to, other, giant, planets, the, cause, of, which, remains, unclear, like, the, other, giant, planets, uranus, has, a, ring, system, a, magnetosphere, and, many, natural, satellites, the, extremely, dark, ring, system, reflects, only, about, 2, of, the, incoming, light, uranus, s, 28, natural, satellites, include, 18, known, regular, moons, of, which, 13, are, small, inner, moons, further, out, are, the, larger, five, major, moons, of, the, planet, miranda, ariel, umbriel, titania, and, oberon, orbiting, at, a, much, greater, distance, from, uranus, are, the, nine, known, irregular, moons, the, planet, s, magnetosphere, is, highly, asymmetric, and, has, many, charged, particles, which, may, be, the, cause, of, the, darkening, of, its, rings, and, moons, uranus, is, visible, to, the, naked, eye, but, it, is, very, dim, and, was, not, classified, as, a, planet, until, 1781, when, it, was, first, observed, by, william, herschel, about, seven, decades, after, its, discovery, consensus, was, reached, that, the, planet, be, named, after, the, greek, god, uranus, ouranos, one, of, the, greek, primordial, deities, as, of, 2024, it, had, been, visited, up, close, only, once, when, in, 1986, the, voyager, 2, probe, flew, by, the, planet, though, nowadays, it, can, be, resolved, and, observed, by, telescopes, there, is, much, desire, to, revisit, the, planet, as, shown, by, planetary, science, decadal, survey, s, decision, to, make, the, proposed, uranus, orbiter, and, probe, mission, a, top, priority, in, the, 2023, 2032, survey, and, the, cnsa, s, proposal, to, fly, by, the, planet, with, a, subprobe, of, tianwen, 4, like, the, classical, planets, uranus, is, visible, to, the, naked, eye, but, it, was, never, recognised, as, a, planet, by, ancient, observers, because, of, its, dimness, and, slow, orbit, william, herschel, first, observed, uranus, on, 13, march, 1781, leading, to, its, discovery, as, a, planet, expanding, the, known, boundaries, of, the, solar, system, for, the, first, time, in, history, and, making, uranus, the, first, planet, classified, as, such, with, the, aid, of, a, telescope, the, discovery, of, uranus, also, effectively, doubled, the, size, of, the, known, solar, system, because, uranus, is, around, twice, the, distance, from, the, sun, as, the, planet, saturn, before, its, recognition, as, a, planet, uranus, had, been, observed, on, numerous, occasions, albeit, generally, misidentified, as, a, star, the, earliest, possible, known, observation, was, by, hipparchus, who, in, 128, bc, might, have, recorded, it, as, a, star, for, his, star, catalogue, that, was, later, incorporated, into, ptolemy, s, almagest, the, earliest, definite, sighting, was, in, 1690, when, john, flamsteed, observed, it, at, least, six, times, cataloguing, it, as, 34, tauri, the, french, astronomer, pierre, charles, le, monnier, observed, uranus, at, least, twelve, times, between, 1750, and, 1769, including, on, four, consecutive, nights, william, herschel, observed, uranus, on, 13, march, 1781, from, the, garden, of, his, house, at, 19, new, king, street, in, bath, somerset, england, now, the, herschel, museum, of, astronomy, and, initially, reported, it, on, 26, april, 1781, as, a, comet, with, a, homemade, 6, 2, inch, reflecting, telescope, herschel, engaged, in, a, series, of, observations, on, the, parallax, of, the, fixed, stars, herschel, recorded, in, his, journal, in, the, quartile, near, tauri, either, nebulous, star, or, perhaps, a, comet, on, 17, march, he, noted, i, looked, for, the, comet, or, nebulous, star, and, found, that, it, is, a, comet, for, it, has, changed, its, place, when, he, presented, his, discovery, to, the, royal, society, he, continued, to, assert, that, he, had, found, a, comet, but, also, implicitly, compared, it, to, a, planet, the, power, i, had, on, when, i, first, saw, the, comet, was, 227, from, experience, i, know, that, the, diameters, of, the, fixed, stars, are, not, proportionally, magnified, with, higher, powers, as, planets, are, therefore, i, now, put, the, powers, at, 460, and, 932, and, found, that, the, diameter, of, the, comet, increased, in, proportion, to, the, power, as, it, ought, to, be, on, the, supposition, of, its, not, being, a, fixed, star, while, the, diameters, of, the, stars, to, which, i, compared, it, were, not, increased, in, the, same, ratio, moreover, the, comet, being, magnified, much, beyond, what, its, light, would, admit, of, appeared, hazy, and, ill, defined, with, these, great, powers, while, the, stars, preserved, that, lustre, and, distinctness, which, from, many, thousand, observations, i, knew, they, would, retain, the, sequel, has, shown, that, my, surmises, were, well, founded, this, proving, to, be, the, comet, we, have, lately, observed, herschel, notified, the, astronomer, royal, nevil, maskelyne, of, his, discovery, and, received, this, flummoxed, reply, from, him, on, 23, april, 1781, i, don, t, know, what, to, call, it, it, is, as, likely, to, be, a, regular, planet, moving, in, an, orbit, nearly, circular, to, the, sun, as, a, comet, moving, in, a, very, eccentric, ellipsis, i, have, not, yet, seen, any, coma, or, tail, to, it, although, herschel, continued, to, describe, his, new, object, as, a, comet, other, astronomers, had, already, begun, to, suspect, otherwise, finnish, swedish, astronomer, anders, johan, lexell, working, in, russia, was, the, first, to, compute, the, orbit, of, the, new, object, its, nearly, circular, orbit, led, him, to, the, conclusion, that, it, was, a, planet, rather, than, a, comet, berlin, astronomer, johann, elert, bode, described, herschel, s, discovery, as, a, moving, star, that, can, be, deemed, a, hitherto, unknown, planet, like, object, circulating, beyond, the, orbit, of, saturn, bode, concluded, that, its, near, circular, orbit, was, more, like, a, planet, s, than, a, comet, s, the, object, was, soon, universally, accepted, as, a, new, planet, by, 1783, herschel, acknowledged, this, to, royal, society, president, joseph, banks, by, the, observation, of, the, most, eminent, astronomers, in, europe, it, appears, that, the, new, star, which, i, had, the, honour, of, pointing, out, to, them, in, march, 1781, is, a, primary, planet, of, our, solar, system, in, recognition, of, his, achievement, king, george, iii, gave, herschel, an, annual, stipend, of, 200, equivalent, to, 30, 000, in, 2023, on, condition, that, he, moved, to, windsor, so, that, the, royal, family, could, look, through, his, telescopes, the, name, uranus, references, the, ancient, greek, deity, of, the, sky, uranus, ancient, greek, known, as, caelus, in, roman, mythology, the, father, of, cronus, saturn, grandfather, of, zeus, jupiter, and, the, great, grandfather, of, ares, mars, which, was, rendered, as, uranus, in, latin, ipa, it, is, the, only, one, of, the, eight, planets, whose, english, name, derives, from, a, figure, of, greek, mythology, the, pronunciation, of, the, name, uranus, preferred, among, astronomers, is, j, r, n, s, yoor, n, s, with, the, long, u, of, english, and, stress, on, the, first, syllable, as, in, latin, uranus, in, contrast, to, j, r, e, n, s, yoo, ray, n, s, with, stress, on, the, second, syllable, and, a, long, a, though, both, are, considered, acceptable, consensus, on, the, name, was, not, reached, until, almost, 70, years, after, the, planet, s, discovery, during, the, original, discussions, following, discovery, maskelyne, asked, herschel, to, do, the, astronomical, world, the, faver, to, give, a, name, to, your, planet, which, is, entirely, your, own, which, we, are, so, much, obliged, to, you, for, the, discovery, of, in, response, to, maskelyne, s, request, herschel, decided, to, name, the, object, georgium, sidus, george, s, star, or, the, georgian, planet, in, honour, of, his, new, patron, king, george, iii, he, explained, this, decision, in, a, letter, to, joseph, banks, in, the, fabulous, ages, of, ancient, times, the, appellations, of, mercury, venus, mars, jupiter, and, saturn, were, given, to, the, planets, as, being, the, names, of, their, principal, heroes, and, divinities, in, the, present, more, philosophical, era, it, would, hardly, be, allowable, to, have, recourse, to, the, same, method, and, call, it, juno, pallas, apollo, or, minerva, for, a, name, to, our, new, heavenly, body, the, first, consideration, of, any, particular, event, or, remarkable, incident, seems, to, be, its, chronology, if, in, any, future, age, it, should, be, asked, when, this, last, found, planet, was, discovered, it, would, be, a, very, satisfactory, answer, to, say, in, the, reign, of, king, george, the, third, herschel, s, proposed, name, was, not, popular, outside, britain, and, hanover, and, alternatives, were, soon, proposed, astronomer, j, r, me, lalande, proposed, that, it, be, named, herschel, in, honour, of, its, discoverer, swedish, astronomer, erik, prosperin, proposed, the, names, astraea, cybele, now, the, names, of, asteroids, and, neptune, which, would, become, the, name, of, the, next, planet, to, be, discovered, the, name, was, supported, by, other, astronomers, who, liked, the, idea, of, commemorating, the, victories, of, the, british, royal, naval, fleet, in, the, course, of, the, american, revolutionary, war, by, calling, the, new, planet, either, neptune, george, iii, or, neptune, great, britain, a, compromise, lexell, suggested, as, well, daniel, bernoulli, suggested, hypercronius, and, transaturnis, georg, lichtenberg, from, g, ttingen, suggested, austr, a, a, goddess, mentioned, by, ovid, but, who, is, traditionally, associated, with, virgo, the, name, minerva, was, also, proposed, in, a, march, 1782, treatise, johann, elert, bode, proposed, uranus, the, latinised, version, of, the, greek, god, of, the, sky, ouranos, bode, argued, that, the, name, should, follow, the, mythology, so, as, not, to, stand, out, as, different, from, the, other, planets, and, that, uranus, was, an, appropriate, name, as, the, father, of, the, first, generation, of, the, titans, he, also, noted, the, elegance, of, the, name, in, that, just, as, saturn, was, the, father, of, jupiter, the, new, planet, should, be, named, after, the, father, of, saturn, however, he, was, apparently, unaware, that, uranus, was, only, the, latinised, form, of, the, deity, s, name, and, the, roman, equivalent, was, caelus, in, 1789, bode, s, royal, academy, colleague, martin, klaproth, named, his, newly, discovered, element, uranium, in, support, of, bode, s, choice, ultimately, bode, s, suggestion, became, the, most, widely, used, and, became, universal, in, 1850, when, hm, nautical, almanac, office, the, final, holdout, switched, from, using, georgium, sidus, to, uranus, uranus, has, two, astronomical, symbols, the, first, to, be, proposed, was, proposed, by, johann, gottfried, k, hler, at, bode, s, request, in, 1782, k, hler, suggested, that, the, new, planet, be, given, the, symbol, for, platinum, which, had, been, described, scientifically, only, 30, years, before, as, there, was, no, alchemical, symbol, for, platinum, he, suggested, or, a, combination, of, the, planetary, metal, symbols, gold, and, iron, as, platinum, or, white, gold, is, found, mixed, with, iron, bode, thought, that, an, upright, orientation, fit, better, with, the, symbols, for, the, other, planets, while, remaining, distinct, this, symbol, predominates, in, modern, astronomical, use, in, the, rare, cases, that, symbols, are, used, at, all, the, second, symbol, was, suggested, by, lalande, in, 1784, in, a, letter, to, herschel, lalande, described, it, as, un, globe, surmont, par, la, premi, re, lettre, de, votre, nom, a, globe, surmounted, by, the, first, letter, of, your, surname, the, second, symbol, is, nearly, universal, in, astrology, in, english, language, popular, culture, humour, is, often, derived, from, the, common, pronunciation, of, uranus, s, name, which, resembles, that, of, the, phrase, your, anus, uranus, is, called, by, a, variety, of, names, in, other, languages, uranus, s, name, is, literally, translated, as, the, sky, king, star, in, chinese, ti, nw, ngx, ng, japanese, korean, and, vietnamese, sao, thi, n, v, ng, in, thai, its, official, name, is, dao, yurenat, as, in, english, its, other, name, in, thai, is, dao, maruettayu, star, of, m, tyu, after, the, sanskrit, word, for, death, mrtyu, in, mongolian, its, name, is, tengeriin, van, translated, as, king, of, the, sky, reflecting, its, namesake, god, s, role, as, the, ruler, of, the, heavens, in, hawaiian, its, name, is, hele, ekala, the, hawaiian, rendering, of, the, name, herschel, in, m, ori, its, name, is, wh, rangi, it, is, argued, that, the, differences, between, the, ice, giants, and, the, gas, giants, arise, from, their, formation, history, the, solar, system, is, hypothesised, to, have, formed, from, a, rotating, disk, of, gas, and, dust, known, as, the, presolar, nebula, much, of, the, nebula, s, gas, primarily, hydrogen, and, helium, formed, the, sun, and, the, dust, grains, collected, together, to, form, the, first, protoplanets, as, the, planets, grew, some, of, them, eventually, accreted, enough, matter, for, their, gravity, to, hold, on, to, the, nebula, s, leftover, gas, the, more, gas, they, held, onto, the, larger, they, became, the, larger, they, became, the, more, gas, they, held, onto, until, a, critical, point, was, reached, and, their, size, began, to, increase, exponentially, the, ice, giants, with, only, a, few, earth, masses, of, nebular, gas, never, reached, that, critical, point, recent, simulations, of, planetary, migration, have, suggested, that, both, ice, giants, formed, closer, to, the, sun, than, their, present, positions, and, moved, outwards, after, formation, the, nice, model, uranus, orbits, the, sun, once, every, 84, years, as, viewed, against, the, background, of, stars, since, being, discovered, in, 1781, the, planet, has, returned, to, the, point, of, its, discovery, northeast, of, the, binary, star, zeta, tauri, twice, in, march, 1865, and, march, 1949, and, will, return, to, this, location, again, in, april, 2033, its, average, distance, from, the, sun, is, roughly, 20, au, 3, billion, km, 2, billion, mi, the, difference, between, its, minimum, and, maximum, distance, from, the, sun, is, 1, 8, au, larger, than, that, of, any, other, planet, though, not, as, large, as, that, of, dwarf, planet, pluto, the, intensity, of, sunlight, varies, inversely, with, the, square, of, the, distance, on, uranus, at, about, 20, times, the, distance, from, the, sun, compared, to, earth, it, is, about, 1, 400, the, intensity, of, light, on, earth, the, orbital, elements, of, uranus, were, first, calculated, in, 1783, by, pierre, simon, laplace, with, time, discrepancies, began, to, appear, between, predicted, and, observed, orbits, and, in, 1841, john, couch, adams, first, proposed, that, the, differences, might, be, due, to, the, gravitational, tug, of, an, unseen, planet, in, 1845, urbain, le, verrier, began, his, own, independent, research, into, uranus, s, orbit, on, 23, september, 1846, johann, gottfried, galle, located, a, new, planet, later, named, neptune, at, nearly, the, position, predicted, by, le, verrier, the, rotational, period, of, the, interior, of, uranus, is, 17, hours, 14, minutes, as, on, all, giant, planets, its, upper, atmosphere, experiences, strong, winds, in, the, direction, of, rotation, at, some, latitudes, such, as, about, 60, degrees, south, visible, features, of, the, atmosphere, move, much, faster, making, a, full, rotation, in, as, little, as, 14, hours, the, uranian, axis, of, rotation, is, approximately, parallel, to, the, plane, of, the, solar, system, with, an, axial, tilt, of, 82, 23, depending, on, which, pole, is, considered, north, the, tilt, can, be, described, either, as, 82, 23, or, as, 97, 8, the, former, follows, the, international, astronomical, union, definition, that, the, north, pole, is, the, pole, which, lies, on, earth, s, north, s, side, of, the, invariable, plane, of, the, solar, system, uranus, has, retrograde, rotation, when, defined, this, way, alternatively, the, convention, in, which, a, body, s, north, and, south, poles, are, defined, according, to, the, right, hand, rule, in, relation, to, the, direction, of, rotation, uranus, s, axial, tilt, may, be, given, instead, as, 97, 8, which, reverses, which, pole, is, considered, north, and, which, is, considered, south, and, giving, the, planet, prograde, rotation, this, gives, it, seasonal, changes, completely, unlike, those, of, the, other, planets, pluto, and, the, protoplanet, asteroid, 2, pallas, also, have, extreme, axial, tilts, near, the, solstice, one, pole, faces, the, sun, continuously, and, the, other, faces, away, with, only, a, narrow, strip, around, the, equator, experiencing, a, rapid, day, night, cycle, with, the, sun, low, over, the, horizon, on, the, other, side, of, uranus, s, orbit, the, orientation, of, the, poles, towards, the, sun, is, reversed, each, pole, gets, around, 42, years, of, continuous, sunlight, followed, by, 42, years, of, darkness, near, the, time, of, the, equinoxes, the, sun, faces, the, equator, of, uranus, giving, a, period, of, day, night, cycles, similar, to, those, seen, on, most, of, the, other, planets, one, result, of, this, axis, orientation, is, that, averaged, over, the, uranian, year, the, near, polar, regions, of, uranus, receive, a, greater, energy, input, from, the, sun, than, its, equatorial, regions, nevertheless, uranus, is, hotter, at, its, equator, than, at, its, poles, the, underlying, mechanism, that, causes, this, is, unknown, the, reason, for, uranus, s, unusual, axial, tilt, is, also, not, known, with, certainty, but, the, usual, speculation, is, that, during, the, formation, of, the, solar, system, an, earth, sized, protoplanet, collided, with, uranus, causing, the, skewed, orientation, research, by, jacob, kegerreis, of, durham, university, suggests, that, the, tilt, resulted, from, a, rock, larger, than, earth, crashing, into, the, planet, 3, to, 4, billion, years, ago, uranus, s, south, pole, was, pointed, almost, directly, at, the, sun, at, the, time, of, voyager, 2, s, flyby, in, 1986, the, mean, apparent, magnitude, of, uranus, is, 5, 68, with, a, standard, deviation, of, 0, 17, while, the, extremes, are, 5, 38, and, 6, 03, this, range, of, brightness, is, near, the, limit, of, naked, eye, visibility, much, of, the, variability, is, dependent, upon, the, planetary, latitudes, being, illuminated, from, the, sun, and, viewed, from, the, earth, its, angular, diameter, is, between, 3, 4, and, 3, 7, arcseconds, compared, with, 16, to, 20, arcseconds, for, saturn, and, 32, to, 45, arcseconds, for, jupiter, at, opposition, uranus, is, visible, to, the, naked, eye, in, dark, skies, and, becomes, an, easy, target, even, in, urban, conditions, with, binoculars, on, larger, amateur, telescopes, with, an, objective, diameter, of, between, 15, and, 23, cm, uranus, appears, as, a, pale, cyan, disk, with, distinct, limb, darkening, with, a, large, telescope, of, 25, cm, or, wider, cloud, patterns, as, well, as, some, of, the, larger, satellites, such, as, titania, and, oberon, may, be, visible, uranus, s, mass, is, roughly, 14, 5, times, that, of, earth, making, it, the, least, massive, of, the, giant, planets, its, diameter, is, slightly, larger, than, neptune, s, at, roughly, four, times, that, of, earth, a, resulting, density, of, 1, 27, g, cm, 3, makes, uranus, the, second, least, dense, planet, after, saturn, this, value, indicates, that, it, is, made, primarily, of, various, ices, such, as, water, ammonia, and, methane, the, total, mass, of, ice, in, uranus, s, interior, is, not, precisely, known, because, different, figures, emerge, depending, on, the, model, chosen, it, must, be, between, 9, 3, and, 13, 5, earth, masses, hydrogen, and, helium, constitute, only, a, small, part, of, the, total, with, between, 0, 5, and, 1, 5, earth, masses, the, remainder, of, the, non, ice, mass, 0, 5, to, 3, 7, earth, masses, is, accounted, for, by, rocky, material, the, standard, model, of, uranus, s, structure, is, that, it, consists, of, three, layers, a, rocky, silicate, iron, nickel, core, in, the, centre, an, icy, mantle, in, the, middle, and, an, outer, gaseous, hydrogen, helium, envelope, the, core, is, relatively, small, with, a, mass, of, only, 0, 55, earth, masses, and, a, radius, less, than, 20, of, the, planet, the, mantle, comprises, its, bulk, with, around, 13, 4, earth, masses, and, the, upper, atmosphere, is, relatively, insubstantial, weighing, about, 0, 5, earth, masses, and, extending, for, the, last, 20, of, uranus, s, radius, uranus, s, core, density, is, around, 9, g, cm, 3, with, a, pressure, in, the, centre, of, 8, million, bars, 800, gpa, and, a, temperature, of, about, 5000, k, the, ice, mantle, is, not, in, fact, composed, of, ice, in, the, conventional, sense, but, of, a, hot, and, dense, fluid, consisting, of, water, ammonia, and, other, volatiles, this, fluid, which, has, a, high, electrical, conductivity, is, sometimes, called, a, water, ammonia, ocean, the, extreme, pressure, and, temperature, deep, within, uranus, may, break, up, the, methane, molecules, with, the, carbon, atoms, condensing, into, crystals, of, diamond, that, rain, down, through, the, mantle, like, hailstones, this, phenomenon, is, similar, to, diamond, rains, that, are, theorised, by, scientists, to, exist, on, jupiter, saturn, and, neptune, very, high, pressure, experiments, at, the, lawrence, livermore, national, laboratory, suggest, that, an, ocean, of, metallic, liquid, carbon, perhaps, with, floating, solid, diamond, bergs, may, comprise, the, base, of, the, mantle, the, bulk, compositions, of, uranus, and, neptune, are, different, from, those, of, jupiter, and, saturn, with, ice, dominating, over, gases, hence, justifying, their, separate, classification, as, ice, giants, there, may, be, a, layer, of, ionic, water, where, the, water, molecules, break, down, into, a, soup, of, hydrogen, and, oxygen, ions, and, deeper, down, superionic, water, in, which, the, oxygen, crystallises, but, the, hydrogen, ions, move, freely, within, the, oxygen, lattice, although, the, model, considered, above, is, reasonably, standard, it, is, not, unique, other, models, also, satisfy, observations, for, instance, if, substantial, amounts, of, hydrogen, and, rocky, material, are, mixed, in, the, ice, mantle, the, total, mass, of, ices, in, the, interior, will, be, lower, and, correspondingly, the, total, mass, of, rocks, and, hydrogen, will, be, higher, presently, available, data, does, not, allow, a, scientific, determination, of, which, model, is, correct, the, fluid, interior, structure, of, uranus, means, that, it, has, no, solid, surface, the, gaseous, atmosphere, gradually, transitions, into, the, internal, liquid, layers, for, the, sake, of, convenience, a, revolving, oblate, spheroid, set, at, the, point, at, which, atmospheric, pressure, equals, 1, bar, 100, kpa, is, conditionally, designated, as, a, surface, it, has, equatorial, and, polar, radii, of, 25, 559, 4, km, 15, 881, 6, 2, 5, mi, and, 24, 973, 20, km, 15, 518, 12, mi, respectively, this, surface, is, used, throughout, this, article, as, a, zero, point, for, altitudes, uranus, s, internal, heat, appears, markedly, lower, than, that, of, the, other, giant, planets, in, astronomical, terms, it, has, a, low, thermal, flux, why, uranus, s, internal, temperature, is, so, low, is, still, not, understood, neptune, which, is, uranus, s, near, twin, in, size, and, composition, radiates, 2, 61, times, as, much, energy, into, space, as, it, receives, from, the, sun, but, uranus, radiates, hardly, any, excess, heat, at, all, the, total, power, radiated, by, uranus, in, the, far, infrared, i, e, heat, part, of, the, spectrum, is, 1, 06, 0, 08, times, the, solar, energy, absorbed, in, its, atmosphere, uranus, s, heat, flux, is, only, 0, 042, 0, 047, w, m, 2, which, is, lower, than, the, internal, heat, flux, of, earth, of, about, 0, 075, w, m, 2, the, lowest, temperature, recorded, in, uranus, s, tropopause, is, 49, k, 224, 2, c, 371, 5, f, making, uranus, the, coldest, planet, in, the, solar, system, one, of, the, hypotheses, for, this, discrepancy, suggests, the, earth, sized, impactor, theorised, to, be, behind, uranus, axial, tilt, left, the, planet, with, a, depleted, core, temperature, as, the, impact, caused, uranus, to, expel, most, of, its, primordial, heat, another, hypothesis, is, that, some, form, of, barrier, exists, in, uranus, s, upper, layers, that, prevents, the, core, s, heat, from, reaching, the, surface, for, example, convection, may, take, place, in, a, set, of, compositionally, different, layers, which, may, inhibit, upward, heat, transport, perhaps, double, diffusive, convection, is, a, limiting, factor, in, a, 2021, study, the, ice, giants, interior, conditions, were, mimicked, by, compressing, water, that, contained, minerals, such, as, olivine, and, ferropericlase, thus, showing, that, large, amounts, of, magnesium, could, be, dissolved, in, the, liquid, interiors, of, uranus, and, neptune, if, uranus, has, more, of, this, magnesium, than, neptune, it, could, form, a, thermal, insulation, layer, thus, potentially, explaining, the, planet, s, low, temperature, although, there, is, no, well, defined, solid, surface, within, uranus, s, interior, the, outermost, part, of, uranus, s, gaseous, envelope, that, is, accessible, to, remote, sensing, is, called, its, atmosphere, remote, sensing, capability, extends, down, to, roughly, 300, km, below, the, 1, bar, 100, kpa, level, with, a, corresponding, pressure, around, 100, bar, 10, mpa, and, temperature, of, 320, k, 47, c, 116, f, the, tenuous, thermosphere, extends, over, two, planetary, radii, from, the, nominal, surface, which, is, defined, to, lie, at, a, pressure, of, 1, bar, the, uranian, atmosphere, can, be, divided, into, three, layers, the, troposphere, between, altitudes, of, 300, and, 50, km, 186, and, 31, mi, and, pressures, from, 100, to, 0, 1, bar, 10, mpa, to, 10, kpa, the, stratosphere, spanning, altitudes, between, 50, and, 4, 000, km, 31, and, 2, 485, mi, and, pressures, of, between, 0, 1, and, 10, 10, bar, 10, kpa, to, 10, pa, and, the, thermosphere, extending, from, 4, 000, km, to, as, high, as, 50, 000, km, from, the, surface, there, is, no, mesosphere, the, composition, of, uranus, s, atmosphere, is, different, from, its, bulk, consisting, mainly, of, molecular, hydrogen, and, helium, the, helium, molar, fraction, i, e, the, number, of, helium, atoms, per, molecule, of, gas, is, 0, 15, 0, 03, in, the, upper, troposphere, which, corresponds, to, a, mass, fraction, 0, 26, 0, 05, this, value, is, close, to, the, protosolar, helium, mass, fraction, of, 0, 275, 0, 01, indicating, that, helium, has, not, settled, in, its, centre, as, it, has, in, the, gas, giants, the, third, most, abundant, component, of, uranus, s, atmosphere, is, methane, ch, 4, methane, has, prominent, absorption, bands, in, the, visible, and, near, infrared, ir, making, uranus, aquamarine, or, cyan, in, colour, methane, molecules, account, for, 2, 3, of, the, atmosphere, by, molar, fraction, below, the, methane, cloud, deck, at, the, pressure, level, of, 1, 3, bar, 130, kpa, this, represents, about, 20, to, 30, times, the, carbon, abundance, found, in, the, sun, the, mixing, ratio, is, much, lower, in, the, upper, atmosphere, due, to, its, extremely, low, temperature, which, lowers, the, saturation, level, and, causes, excess, methane, to, freeze, out, the, abundances, of, less, volatile, compounds, such, as, ammonia, water, and, hydrogen, sulfide, in, the, deep, atmosphere, are, poorly, known, they, are, probably, also, higher, than, solar, values, along, with, methane, trace, amounts, of, various, hydrocarbons, are, found, in, the, stratosphere, of, uranus, which, are, thought, to, be, produced, from, methane, by, photolysis, induced, by, the, solar, ultraviolet, uv, radiation, they, include, ethane, c, 2, h, 6, acetylene, c, 2, h, 2, methylacetylene, ch, 3, c, 2, h, and, diacetylene, c, 2, hc, 2, h, spectroscopy, has, also, uncovered, traces, of, water, vapour, carbon, monoxide, and, carbon, dioxide, in, the, upper, atmosphere, which, can, only, originate, from, an, external, source, such, as, infalling, dust, and, comets, the, troposphere, is, the, lowest, and, densest, part, of, the, atmosphere, and, is, characterised, by, a, decrease, in, temperature, with, altitude, the, temperature, falls, from, about, 320, k, 47, c, 116, f, at, the, base, of, the, nominal, troposphere, at, 300, km, to, 53, k, 220, c, 364, f, at, 50, km, the, temperatures, in, the, coldest, upper, region, of, the, troposphere, the, tropopause, actually, vary, in, the, range, between, 49, and, 57, k, 224, and, 216, c, 371, and, 357, f, depending, on, planetary, latitude, the, tropopause, region, is, responsible, for, the, vast, majority, of, uranus, s, thermal, far, infrared, emissions, thus, determining, its, effective, temperature, of, 59, 1, 0, 3, k, 214, 1, 0, 3, c, 353, 3, 0, 5, f, the, troposphere, is, thought, to, have, a, highly, complex, cloud, structure, water, clouds, are, hypothesised, to, lie, in, the, pressure, range, of, 50, to, 100, bar, 5, to, 10, mpa, ammonium, hydrosulfide, clouds, in, the, range, of, 20, to, 40, bar, 2, to, 4, mpa, ammonia, or, hydrogen, sulfide, clouds, at, between, 3, and, 10, bar, 0, 3, and, 1, mpa, and, finally, directly, detected, thin, methane, clouds, at, 1, to, 2, bar, 0, 1, to, 0, 2, mpa, the, troposphere, is, a, dynamic, part, of, the, atmosphere, exhibiting, strong, winds, bright, clouds, and, seasonal, changes, the, middle, layer, of, the, uranian, atmosphere, is, the, stratosphere, where, temperature, generally, increases, with, altitude, from, 53, k, 220, c, 364, f, in, the, tropopause, to, between, 800, and, 850, k, 527, and, 577, c, 980, and, 1, 070, f, at, the, base, of, the, thermosphere, the, heating, of, the, stratosphere, is, caused, by, absorption, of, solar, uv, and, ir, radiation, by, methane, and, other, hydrocarbons, which, form, in, this, part, of, the, atmosphere, as, a, result, of, methane, photolysis, heat, is, also, conducted, from, the, hot, thermosphere, the, hydrocarbons, occupy, a, relatively, narrow, layer, at, altitudes, of, between, 100, and, 300, km, corresponding, to, a, pressure, range, of, 1, 000, to, 10, pa, and, temperatures, of, between, 75, and, 170, k, 198, and, 103, c, 325, and, 154, f, the, most, abundant, hydrocarbons, are, methane, acetylene, and, ethane, with, mixing, ratios, of, around, 10, 7, relative, to, hydrogen, the, mixing, ratio, of, carbon, monoxide, is, similar, at, these, altitudes, heavier, hydrocarbons, and, carbon, dioxide, have, mixing, ratios, three, orders, of, magnitude, lower, the, abundance, ratio, of, water, is, around, 7, 10, 9, ethane, and, acetylene, tend, to, condense, in, the, colder, lower, part, of, the, stratosphere, and, tropopause, below, 10, mbar, level, forming, haze, layers, which, may, be, partly, responsible, for, the, bland, appearance, of, uranus, the, concentration, of, hydrocarbons, in, the, uranian, stratosphere, above, the, haze, is, significantly, lower, than, in, the, stratospheres, of, the, other, giant, planets, the, outermost, layer, of, the, uranian, atmosphere, is, the, thermosphere, and, corona, which, has, a, uniform, temperature, of, around, 800, k, 527, c, to, 850, k, 577, c, the, heat, sources, necessary, to, sustain, such, a, high, level, are, not, understood, as, neither, the, solar, uv, nor, the, auroral, activity, can, provide, the, necessary, energy, to, maintain, these, temperatures, the, weak, cooling, efficiency, due, to, the, lack, of, hydrocarbons, in, the, stratosphere, above, 0, 1, mbar, pressure, levels, may, contribute, too, in, addition, to, molecular, hydrogen, the, thermosphere, corona, contains, many, free, hydrogen, atoms, their, small, mass, and, high, temperatures, explain, why, the, corona, extends, as, far, as, 50, 000, km, 31, 000, mi, or, two, uranian, radii, from, its, surface, this, extended, corona, is, a, unique, feature, of, uranus, its, effects, include, a, drag, on, small, particles, orbiting, uranus, causing, a, general, depletion, of, dust, in, the, uranian, rings, the, uranian, thermosphere, together, with, the, upper, part, of, the, stratosphere, corresponds, to, the, ionosphere, of, uranus, observations, show, that, the, ionosphere, occupies, altitudes, from, 2, 000, to, 10, 000, km, 1, 200, to, 6, 200, mi, the, uranian, ionosphere, is, denser, than, that, of, either, saturn, or, neptune, which, may, arise, from, the, low, concentration, of, hydrocarbons, in, the, stratosphere, the, ionosphere, is, mainly, sustained, by, solar, uv, radiation, and, its, density, depends, on, the, solar, activity, auroral, activity, is, insignificant, as, compared, to, jupiter, and, saturn, at, ultraviolet, and, visible, wavelengths, uranus, s, atmosphere, is, bland, in, comparison, to, the, other, giant, planets, even, to, neptune, which, it, otherwise, closely, resembles, when, voyager, 2, flew, by, uranus, in, 1986, it, observed, a, total, of, 10, cloud, features, across, the, entire, planet, one, proposed, explanation, for, this, dearth, of, features, is, that, uranus, s, internal, heat, is, markedly, lower, than, that, of, the, other, giant, planets, being, the, coldest, planet, in, the, solar, system, in, 1986, voyager, 2, found, that, the, visible, southern, hemisphere, of, uranus, can, be, subdivided, into, two, regions, a, bright, polar, cap, and, dark, equatorial, bands, their, boundary, is, located, at, about, 45, of, latitude, a, narrow, band, straddling, the, latitudinal, range, from, 45, to, 50, is, the, brightest, large, feature, on, its, visible, surface, it, is, called, a, southern, collar, the, cap, and, collar, are, thought, to, be, a, dense, region, of, methane, clouds, located, within, the, pressure, range, of, 1, 3, to, 2, bar, besides, the, large, scale, banded, structure, voyager, 2, observed, ten, small, bright, clouds, most, lying, several, degrees, to, the, north, from, the, collar, in, all, other, respects, uranus, looked, like, a, dynamically, dead, planet, in, 1986, voyager, 2, arrived, during, the, height, of, uranus, s, southern, summer, and, could, not, observe, the, northern, hemisphere, at, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, when, the, northern, polar, region, came, into, view, the, hubble, space, telescope, hst, and, keck, telescope, initially, observed, neither, a, collar, nor, a, polar, cap, in, the, northern, hemisphere, so, uranus, appeared, to, be, asymmetric, bright, near, the, south, pole, and, uniformly, dark, in, the, region, north, of, the, southern, collar, in, 2007, when, uranus, passed, its, equinox, the, southern, collar, almost, disappeared, and, a, faint, northern, collar, emerged, near, 45, of, latitude, in, 2023, a, team, employing, the, very, large, array, observed, a, dark, collar, at, 80, latitude, and, a, bright, spot, at, the, north, pole, indicating, the, presence, of, a, polar, vortex, in, the, 1990s, the, number, of, the, observed, bright, cloud, features, grew, considerably, partly, because, new, high, resolution, imaging, techniques, became, available, most, were, found, in, the, northern, hemisphere, as, it, started, to, become, visible, an, early, explanation, that, bright, clouds, are, easier, to, identify, in, its, dark, part, whereas, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, bright, collar, masks, them, was, shown, to, be, incorrect, nevertheless, there, are, differences, between, the, clouds, of, each, hemisphere, the, northern, clouds, are, smaller, sharper, and, brighter, they, appear, to, lie, at, a, higher, altitude, the, lifetime, of, clouds, spans, several, orders, of, magnitude, some, small, clouds, live, for, hours, at, least, one, southern, cloud, may, have, persisted, since, the, voyager, 2, flyby, recent, observation, also, discovered, that, cloud, features, on, uranus, have, a, lot, in, common, with, those, on, neptune, for, example, the, dark, spots, common, on, neptune, had, never, been, observed, on, uranus, before, 2006, when, the, first, such, feature, dubbed, uranus, dark, spot, was, imaged, the, speculation, is, that, uranus, is, becoming, more, neptune, like, during, its, equinoctial, season, the, tracking, of, numerous, cloud, features, allowed, determination, of, zonal, winds, blowing, in, the, upper, troposphere, of, uranus, at, the, equator, winds, are, retrograde, which, means, that, they, blow, in, the, reverse, direction, to, the, planetary, rotation, their, speeds, are, from, 360, to, 180, km, h, 220, to, 110, mph, wind, speeds, increase, with, the, distance, from, the, equator, reaching, zero, values, near, 20, latitude, where, the, troposphere, s, temperature, minimum, is, located, closer, to, the, poles, the, winds, shift, to, a, prograde, direction, flowing, with, uranus, s, rotation, wind, speeds, continue, to, increase, reaching, maxima, at, 60, latitude, before, falling, to, zero, at, the, poles, wind, speeds, at, 40, latitude, range, from, 540, to, 720, km, h, 340, to, 450, mph, because, the, collar, obscures, all, clouds, below, that, parallel, speeds, between, it, and, the, southern, pole, are, impossible, to, measure, in, contrast, in, the, northern, hemisphere, maximum, speeds, as, high, as, 860, km, h, 540, mph, are, observed, near, 50, latitude, in, 1986, the, voyager, 2, planetary, radio, astronomy, pra, experiment, observed, 140, lightning, flashes, or, uranian, electrostatic, discharges, with, a, frequency, of, 0, 9, 40, mhz, the, ueds, were, detected, from, 600, 000, km, of, uranus, over, 24, hours, most, of, which, were, not, visible, however, microphysical, modelling, suggests, that, uranian, lightning, occurs, in, convective, storms, occurring, in, deep, troposphere, water, clouds, if, this, is, the, case, lightning, will, not, be, visible, due, to, the, thick, cloud, layers, above, the, troposphere, the, ueds, were, detected, from, 600, 000, km, of, uranus, most, of, which, were, not, visible, uranian, lightning, has, a, power, of, around, 10, 8, w, emits, 1, 10, 7, j, 2, 10, 7, j, of, energy, and, lasts, an, average, of, 120, ms, there, is, a, possibility, that, the, power, of, uranian, lightning, varies, greatly, with, the, seasons, caused, by, changes, in, convection, rates, in, the, clouds, the, ueds, were, detected, from, 600, 000, km, of, uranus, most, of, which, were, not, visible, uranian, lightning, is, much, more, powerful, than, lightning, on, earth, and, comparable, to, jovian, lightning, during, the, ice, giant, flybys, voyager, 2, detected, lightning, more, clearly, on, uranus, than, on, neptune, due, to, the, planet, s, lower, gravity, and, possible, warmer, deep, atmosphere, for, a, short, period, from, march, to, may, 2004, large, clouds, appeared, in, the, uranian, atmosphere, giving, it, a, neptune, like, appearance, observations, included, record, breaking, wind, speeds, of, 820, km, h, 510, mph, and, a, persistent, thunderstorm, referred, to, as, fourth, of, july, fireworks, on, 23, august, 2006, researchers, at, the, space, science, institute, boulder, colorado, and, the, university, of, wisconsin, observed, a, dark, spot, on, uranus, s, surface, giving, scientists, more, insight, into, uranus, atmospheric, activity, why, this, sudden, upsurge, in, activity, occurred, is, not, fully, known, but, it, appears, that, uranus, s, extreme, axial, tilt, results, in, extreme, seasonal, variations, in, its, weather, determining, the, nature, of, this, seasonal, variation, is, difficult, because, good, data, on, uranus, s, atmosphere, has, existed, for, less, than, 84, years, or, one, full, uranian, year, photometry, over, the, course, of, half, a, uranian, year, beginning, in, the, 1950s, has, shown, regular, variation, in, the, brightness, in, two, spectral, bands, with, maxima, occurring, at, the, solstices, and, minima, occurring, at, the, equinoxes, a, similar, periodic, variation, with, maxima, at, the, solstices, has, been, noted, in, microwave, measurements, of, the, deep, troposphere, begun, in, the, 1960s, stratospheric, temperature, measurements, beginning, in, the, 1970s, also, showed, maximum, values, near, the, 1986, solstice, the, majority, of, this, variability, is, thought, to, occur, owing, to, changes, in, viewing, geometry, there, are, some, indications, that, physical, seasonal, changes, are, happening, in, uranus, although, uranus, is, known, to, have, a, bright, south, polar, region, the, north, pole, is, fairly, dim, which, is, incompatible, with, the, model, of, the, seasonal, change, outlined, above, during, its, previous, northern, solstice, in, 1944, uranus, displayed, elevated, levels, of, brightness, which, suggests, that, the, north, pole, was, not, always, so, dim, this, information, implies, that, the, visible, pole, brightens, some, time, before, the, solstice, and, darkens, after, the, equinox, detailed, analysis, of, the, visible, and, microwave, data, revealed, that, the, periodical, changes, in, brightness, are, not, completely, symmetrical, around, the, solstices, which, also, indicates, a, change, in, the, meridional, albedo, patterns, in, the, 1990s, as, uranus, moved, away, from, its, solstice, hubble, and, ground, based, telescopes, revealed, that, the, south, polar, cap, darkened, noticeably, except, the, southern, collar, which, remained, bright, whereas, the, northern, hemisphere, demonstrated, increasing, activity, such, as, cloud, formations, and, stronger, winds, bolstering, expectations, that, it, should, brighten, soon, this, indeed, happened, in, 2007, when, it, passed, an, equinox, a, faint, northern, polar, collar, arose, and, the, southern, collar, became, nearly, invisible, although, the, zonal, wind, profile, remained, slightly, asymmetric, with, northern, winds, being, somewhat, slower, than, southern, the, mechanism, of, these, physical, changes, is, still, not, clear, near, the, summer, and, winter, solstices, uranus, s, hemispheres, lie, alternately, either, in, full, glare, of, the, sun, s, rays, or, facing, deep, space, the, brightening, of, the, sunlit, hemisphere, is, thought, to, result, from, the, local, thickening, of, the, methane, clouds, and, haze, layers, located, in, the, troposphere, the, bright, collar, at, 45, latitude, is, also, connected, with, methane, clouds, other, changes, in, the, southern, polar, region, can, be, explained, by, changes, in, the, lower, cloud, layers, the, variation, of, the, microwave, emission, from, uranus, is, probably, caused, by, changes, in, the, deep, tropospheric, circulation, because, thick, polar, clouds, and, haze, may, inhibit, convection, now, that, the, spring, and, autumn, equinoxes, are, arriving, on, uranus, the, dynamics, are, changing, and, convection, can, occur, again, before, the, arrival, of, voyager, 2, no, measurements, of, the, uranian, magnetosphere, had, been, taken, so, its, nature, remained, a, mystery, before, 1986, scientists, had, expected, the, magnetic, field, of, uranus, to, be, in, line, with, the, solar, wind, because, it, would, then, align, with, uranus, s, poles, that, lie, in, the, ecliptic, voyager, s, observations, revealed, that, uranus, s, magnetic, field, is, peculiar, both, because, it, does, not, originate, from, its, geometric, centre, and, because, it, is, tilted, at, 59, from, the, axis, of, rotation, in, fact, the, magnetic, dipole, is, shifted, from, uranus, s, centre, towards, the, south, rotational, pole, by, as, much, as, one, third, of, the, planetary, radius, this, unusual, geometry, results, in, a, highly, asymmetric, magnetosphere, where, the, magnetic, field, strength, on, the, surface, in, the, southern, hemisphere, can, be, as, low, as, 0, 1, gauss, 10, t, whereas, in, the, northern, hemisphere, it, can, be, as, high, as, 1, 1, gauss, 110, t, the, average, field, at, the, surface, is, 0, 23, gauss, 23, t, studies, of, voyager, 2, data, in, 2017, suggest, that, this, asymmetry, causes, uranus, s, magnetosphere, to, connect, with, the, solar, wind, once, a, uranian, day, opening, the, planet, to, the, sun, s, particles, in, comparison, the, magnetic, field, of, earth, is, roughly, as, strong, at, either, pole, and, its, magnetic, equator, is, roughly, parallel, with, its, geographical, equator, the, dipole, moment, of, uranus, is, 50, times, that, of, earth, neptune, has, a, similarly, displaced, and, tilted, magnetic, field, suggesting, that, this, may, be, a, common, feature, of, ice, giants, one, hypothesis, is, that, unlike, the, magnetic, fields, of, the, terrestrial, and, gas, giants, which, are, generated, within, their, cores, the, ice, giants, magnetic, fields, are, generated, by, motion, at, relatively, shallow, depths, for, instance, in, the, water, ammonia, ocean, another, possible, explanation, for, the, magnetosphere, s, alignment, is, that, there, are, oceans, of, liquid, diamond, in, uranus, s, interior, that, would, deter, the, magnetic, field, despite, its, curious, alignment, in, other, respects, the, uranian, magnetosphere, is, like, those, of, other, planets, it, has, a, bow, shock, at, about, 23, uranian, radii, ahead, of, it, a, magnetopause, at, 18, uranian, radii, a, fully, developed, magnetotail, and, radiation, belts, overall, the, structure, of, uranus, s, magnetosphere, is, different, from, jupiter, s, and, more, similar, to, saturn, s, uranus, s, magnetotail, trails, behind, it, into, space, for, millions, of, kilometres, and, is, twisted, by, its, sideways, rotation, into, a, long, corkscrew, uranus, s, magnetosphere, contains, charged, particles, mainly, protons, and, electrons, with, a, small, amount, of, h, 2, ions, many, of, these, particles, probably, derive, from, the, thermosphere, the, ion, and, electron, energies, can, be, as, high, as, 4, and, 1, 2, megaelectronvolts, respectively, the, density, of, low, energy, below, 1, kiloelectronvolt, ions, in, the, inner, magnetosphere, is, about, 2, cm, 3, the, particle, population, is, strongly, affected, by, the, uranian, moons, which, sweep, through, the, magnetosphere, leaving, noticeable, gaps, the, particle, flux, is, high, enough, to, cause, darkening, or, space, weathering, of, their, surfaces, on, an, astronomically, rapid, timescale, of, 100, 000, years, this, may, be, the, cause, of, the, uniformly, dark, colouration, of, the, uranian, satellites, and, rings, uranus, has, relatively, well, developed, aurorae, which, are, seen, as, bright, arcs, around, both, magnetic, poles, unlike, jupiter, s, uranus, s, aurorae, seem, to, be, insignificant, for, the, energy, balance, of, the, planetary, thermosphere, they, or, rather, their, trihydrogen, cations, infrared, spectral, emissions, have, been, studied, in, depth, as, of, late, 2023, in, march, 2020, nasa, astronomers, reported, the, detection, of, a, large, atmospheric, magnetic, bubble, also, known, as, a, plasmoid, released, into, outer, space, from, the, planet, uranus, after, reevaluating, old, data, recorded, by, the, voyager, 2, space, probe, during, a, flyby, of, the, planet, in, 1986, uranus, has, 28, known, natural, satellites, the, names, of, these, satellites, are, chosen, from, characters, in, the, works, of, shakespeare, and, alexander, pope, the, five, main, satellites, are, miranda, ariel, umbriel, titania, and, oberon, the, uranian, satellite, system, is, the, least, massive, among, those, of, the, giant, planets, the, combined, mass, of, the, five, major, satellites, would, be, less, than, half, that, of, triton, largest, moon, of, neptune, alone, the, largest, of, uranus, s, satellites, titania, has, a, radius, of, only, 788, 9, km, 490, 2, mi, or, less, than, half, that, of, the, moon, but, slightly, more, than, rhea, the, second, largest, satellite, of, saturn, making, titania, the, eighth, largest, moon, in, the, solar, system, uranus, s, satellites, have, relatively, low, albedos, ranging, from, 0, 20, for, umbriel, to, 0, 35, for, ariel, in, green, light, they, are, ice, rock, conglomerates, composed, of, roughly, 50, ice, and, 50, rock, the, ice, may, include, ammonia, and, carbon, dioxide, among, the, uranian, satellites, ariel, appears, to, have, the, youngest, surface, with, the, fewest, impact, craters, and, umbriel, the, oldest, miranda, has, fault, canyons, 20, km, 12, mi, deep, terraced, layers, and, a, chaotic, variation, in, surface, ages, and, features, miranda, s, past, geologic, activity, is, thought, to, have, been, driven, by, tidal, heating, at, a, time, when, its, orbit, was, more, eccentric, than, currently, probably, as, a, result, of, a, former, 3, 1, orbital, resonance, with, umbriel, extensional, processes, associated, with, upwelling, diapirs, are, the, likely, origin, of, miranda, s, racetrack, like, coronae, ariel, is, thought, to, have, once, been, held, in, a, 4, 1, resonance, with, titania, uranus, has, at, least, one, horseshoe, orbiter, occupying, the, sun, uranus, l, 3, lagrangian, point, a, gravitationally, unstable, region, at, 180, in, its, orbit, 83982, crantor, crantor, moves, inside, uranus, s, co, orbital, region, on, a, complex, temporary, horseshoe, orbit, 2010, eu, 65, is, also, a, promising, uranus, horseshoe, librator, candidate, the, uranian, rings, are, composed, of, extremely, dark, particles, which, vary, in, size, from, micrometres, to, a, fraction, of, a, metre, thirteen, distinct, rings, are, presently, known, the, brightest, being, the, ring, all, except, the, two, rings, of, uranus, are, extremely, narrow, they, are, usually, a, few, kilometres, wide, the, rings, are, probably, quite, young, the, dynamics, considerations, indicate, that, they, did, not, form, with, uranus, the, matter, in, the, rings, may, once, have, been, part, of, a, moon, or, moons, that, was, shattered, by, high, speed, impacts, from, numerous, pieces, of, debris, that, formed, as, a, result, of, those, impacts, only, a, few, particles, survived, in, stable, zones, corresponding, to, the, locations, of, the, present, rings, william, herschel, described, a, possible, ring, around, uranus, in, 1789, this, sighting, is, generally, considered, doubtful, because, the, rings, are, quite, faint, and, in, the, two, following, centuries, none, were, noted, by, other, observers, still, herschel, made, an, accurate, description, of, the, epsilon, ring, s, size, its, angle, relative, to, earth, its, red, colour, and, its, apparent, changes, as, uranus, travelled, around, the, sun, the, ring, system, was, definitively, discovered, on, 10, march, 1977, by, james, l, elliot, edward, w, dunham, and, jessica, mink, using, the, kuiper, airborne, observatory, the, discovery, was, serendipitous, they, planned, to, use, the, occultation, of, the, star, sao, 158687, also, known, as, hd, 128598, by, uranus, to, study, its, atmosphere, when, their, observations, were, analysed, they, found, that, the, star, had, disappeared, briefly, from, view, five, times, both, before, and, after, it, disappeared, behind, uranus, they, concluded, that, there, must, be, a, ring, system, around, uranus, later, they, detected, four, additional, rings, the, rings, were, directly, imaged, when, voyager, 2, passed, uranus, in, 1986, voyager, 2, also, discovered, two, additional, faint, rings, bringing, the, total, number, to, eleven, in, december, 2005, the, hubble, space, telescope, detected, a, pair, of, previously, unknown, rings, the, largest, is, located, twice, as, far, from, uranus, as, the, previously, known, rings, these, new, rings, are, so, far, from, uranus, that, they, are, called, the, outer, ring, system, hubble, also, spotted, two, small, satellites, one, of, which, mab, shares, its, orbit, with, the, outermost, newly, discovered, ring, the, new, rings, bring, the, total, number, of, uranian, rings, to, 13, in, april, 2006, images, of, the, new, rings, from, the, keck, observatory, yielded, the, colours, of, the, outer, rings, the, outermost, is, blue, and, the, other, one, red, one, hypothesis, concerning, the, outer, ring, s, blue, colour, is, that, it, is, composed, of, minute, particles, of, water, ice, from, the, surface, of, mab, that, are, small, enough, to, scatter, blue, light, in, contrast, uranus, s, inner, rings, appear, grey, although, the, uranian, rings, are, very, difficult, to, directly, observe, from, earth, advances, in, digital, imaging, have, allowed, several, amateur, astronomers, to, successfully, photograph, the, rings, with, red, or, infrared, filters, telescopes, with, apertures, as, small, as, 36, cm, 14, inches, may, be, able, to, detect, the, rings, with, proper, imaging, equipment, launched, in, 1977, voyager, 2, made, its, closest, approach, to, uranus, on, 24, january, 1986, coming, within, 81, 500, km, 50, 600, mi, of, the, cloudtops, before, continuing, its, journey, to, neptune, the, spacecraft, studied, the, structure, and, chemical, composition, of, uranus, s, atmosphere, including, its, unique, weather, caused, by, its, extreme, axial, tilt, it, made, the, first, detailed, investigations, of, its, five, largest, moons, and, discovered, 10, new, ones, voyager, 2, examined, all, nine, of, the, system, s, known, rings, and, discovered, two, more, it, also, studied, the, magnetic, field, its, irregular, structure, its, tilt, and, its, unique, corkscrew, magnetotail, caused, by, uranus, s, sideways, orientation, no, other, spacecraft, has, flown, by, uranus, since, then, though, there, have, been, many, proposed, missions, to, revisit, the, uranus, system, the, possibility, of, sending, the, cassini, spacecraft, from, saturn, to, uranus, was, evaluated, during, a, mission, extension, planning, phase, in, 2009, but, was, ultimately, rejected, in, favour, of, destroying, it, in, the, saturnian, atmosphere, as, it, would, have, taken, about, twenty, years, to, get, to, the, uranian, system, after, departing, saturn, a, uranus, entry, probe, could, use, pioneer, venus, multiprobe, heritage, and, descend, to, 1, 5, atmospheres, a, uranus, orbiter, and, probe, was, recommended, by, the, 2013, 2022, planetary, science, decadal, survey, published, in, 2011, the, proposal, envisaged, launch, during, 2020, 2023, and, a, 13, year, cruise, to, uranus, the, committee, s, opinion, was, reaffirmed, in, 2022, when, a, uranus, probe, orbiter, mission, was, placed, at, the, highest, priority, due, to, the, lack, of, knowledge, about, ice, giants, most, recently, the, cnsa, s, tianwen, 4, jupiter, orbiter, launching, in, 2029, is, planned, to, have, a, subprobe, that, will, detach, and, get, a, gravity, assist, instead, of, entering, orbit, flying, by, uranus, in, march, 2045, before, heading, to, interstellar, space, china, also, has, plans, for, a, potential, tianwen, 5, that, may, orbit, either, uranus, or, neptune, that, have, yet, to, come, to, fruition, bereits, in, der, am, 12ten, m, rz, 1782, bei, der, hiesigen, naturforschenden, gesellschaft, vorgelesenen, abhandlung, habe, ich, den, namen, des, vaters, vom, saturn, nemlich, uranos,

approving, this, designation, in, my, view, it, is, necessary, to, follow, the, mythology, in, this, election, which, had, been, borrowed, from, the, ancient, name, of, the, other, planets, because, in, the, series, of, previously, known, perceived, by, a, strange, person, or, event, of, modern, times, name, of, a, planet, would, very, noticeable, diodorus, of, cilicia, tells, the, story, of,
