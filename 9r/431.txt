radon, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, rn, and, atomic, number, 86, it, is, a, radioactive, noble, gas, and, is, colorless, and, odorless, of, the, three, naturally, occurring, radon, isotopes, only, 222, rn, has, a, sufficiently, long, half, life, 3, 825, days, for, it, to, be, released, from, the, soil, and, rock, where, it, is, generated, radon, isotopes, are, the, immediate, decay, products, of, radium, isotopes, the, instability, of, 222, rn, its, most, stable, isotope, makes, radon, one, of, the, rarest, elements, radon, will, be, present, on, earth, for, several, billion, more, years, despite, its, short, half, life, because, it, is, constantly, being, produced, as, a, step, in, the, decay, chains, of, 238, u, and, 232, th, of, which, both, are, abundant, radioactive, nuclides, with, half, lives, of, at, least, several, billion, years, the, decay, of, radon, produces, many, other, short, lived, nuclides, known, as, radon, daughters, ending, at, stable, isotopes, of, lead, 222, rn, occurs, in, significant, quantities, as, a, step, in, the, normal, radioactive, decay, chain, of, 238, u, also, known, as, the, uranium, series, which, slowly, decays, into, a, variety, of, radioactive, nuclides, and, eventually, decays, into, stable, 206, pb, 220, rn, occurs, in, minute, quantities, as, an, intermediate, step, in, the, decay, chain, of, 232, th, also, known, as, the, thorium, series, which, eventually, decays, into, stable, 208, pb, radon, was, discovered, in, 1899, by, ernest, rutherford, and, robert, b, owens, at, mcgill, university, in, montreal, and, was, the, fifth, radioactive, element, to, be, discovered, first, known, as, emanation, the, radioactive, gas, was, identified, during, experiments, with, radium, thorium, oxide, and, actinium, by, friedrich, ernst, dorn, rutherford, and, owens, and, andr, louis, debierne, respectively, and, each, element, s, emanation, was, considered, to, a, separate, substance, radon, thoron, and, actinon, sir, william, ramsay, and, robert, whytlaw, gray, considered, that, the, radioactive, emanations, may, contain, a, new, element, of, the, noble, gas, family, and, isolated, radium, emanation, in, 1909, to, determine, its, properties, in, 1911, the, element, ramsay, and, whytlaw, gray, isolated, was, accepted, by, the, international, commission, for, atomic, weights, and, in, 1923, the, international, committee, for, chemical, elements, and, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, chose, radon, as, the, accepted, name, for, the, element, s, most, stable, isotope, 222, rn, under, standard, conditions, radon, is, gaseous, and, can, be, easily, inhaled, posing, a, health, hazard, however, the, primary, danger, comes, not, from, radon, itself, but, from, its, decay, products, known, as, radon, daughters, these, decay, products, often, existing, as, single, atoms, or, ions, can, attach, themselves, to, airborne, dust, particles, although, radon, is, a, noble, gas, and, does, not, adhere, to, lung, tissue, meaning, it, is, often, exhaled, before, decaying, the, radon, daughters, attached, to, dust, are, more, likely, to, stick, to, the, lungs, this, increases, the, risk, of, harm, as, the, radon, daughters, can, cause, damage, to, lung, tissue, radon, and, its, daughters, are, taken, together, often, the, single, largest, contributor, to, an, individual, s, background, radiation, dose, but, due, to, local, differences, in, geology, the, level, of, exposure, to, radon, gas, differs, by, location, a, common, source, of, environmental, radon, is, uranium, containing, minerals, in, the, ground, it, therefore, accumulates, in, subterranean, areas, such, as, basements, radon, can, also, occur, in, ground, water, such, as, spring, waters, and, hot, springs, radon, trapped, in, permafrost, may, be, released, by, climate, change, induced, thawing, of, permafrosts, and, radon, may, also, be, released, into, groundwater, and, the, atmosphere, following, seismic, events, leading, to, earthquakes, which, has, led, to, its, investigation, in, the, field, of, earthquake, prediction, it, is, possible, to, test, for, radon, in, buildings, and, to, use, techniques, such, as, sub, slab, depressurization, for, mitigation, epidemiological, studies, have, shown, a, clear, association, between, breathing, high, concentrations, of, radon, and, incidence, of, lung, cancer, radon, is, a, contaminant, that, affects, indoor, air, quality, worldwide, according, to, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, epa, radon, is, the, second, most, frequent, cause, of, lung, cancer, after, cigarette, smoking, causing, 21, 000, lung, cancer, deaths, per, year, in, the, united, states, about, 2, 900, of, these, deaths, occur, among, people, who, have, never, smoked, while, radon, is, the, second, most, frequent, cause, of, lung, cancer, it, is, the, number, one, cause, among, non, smokers, according, to, epa, policy, oriented, estimates, significant, uncertainties, exist, for, the, health, effects, of, low, dose, exposures, radon, is, a, colorless, odorless, and, tasteless, gas, and, therefore, is, not, detectable, by, human, senses, alone, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, it, forms, a, monatomic, gas, with, a, density, of, 9, 73, kg, m, 3, about, 8, times, the, density, of, the, earth, s, atmosphere, at, sea, level, 1, 217, kg, m, 3, it, is, one, of, the, densest, gases, at, room, temperature, a, few, are, denser, e, g, cf, 3, cf, 2, 2, cf, 3, and, wf, 6, and, is, the, densest, of, the, noble, gases, although, colorless, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, when, cooled, below, its, freezing, point, of, 202, k, 71, c, 96, f, it, emits, a, brilliant, radioluminescence, that, turns, from, yellow, to, orange, red, as, the, temperature, lowers, upon, condensation, it, glows, because, of, the, intense, radiation, it, produces, it, is, sparingly, soluble, in, water, but, more, soluble, than, lighter, noble, gases, it, is, appreciably, more, soluble, in, organic, liquids, than, in, water, its, solubility, equation, is, as, follows, where, displaystyle, chi, is, the, molar, fraction, of, radon, t, displaystyle, t, is, the, absolute, temperature, and, a, displaystyle, a, and, b, displaystyle, b, are, solvent, constants, radon, is, a, member, of, the, zero, valence, elements, that, are, called, noble, gases, and, is, chemically, not, very, reactive, the, 3, 8, day, half, life, of, 222, rn, makes, it, useful, in, physical, sciences, as, a, natural, tracer, because, radon, is, a, gas, at, standard, conditions, unlike, its, decay, chain, parents, it, can, readily, be, extracted, from, them, for, research, it, is, inert, to, most, common, chemical, reactions, such, as, combustion, because, the, outer, valence, shell, contains, eight, electrons, this, produces, a, stable, minimum, energy, configuration, in, which, the, outer, electrons, are, tightly, bound, its, first, ionization, energy, the, minimum, energy, required, to, extract, one, electron, from, it, is, 1037, kj, mol, in, accordance, with, periodic, trends, radon, has, a, lower, electronegativity, than, the, element, one, period, before, it, xenon, and, is, therefore, more, reactive, early, studies, concluded, that, the, stability, of, radon, hydrate, should, be, of, the, same, order, as, that, of, the, hydrates, of, chlorine, cl, 2, or, sulfur, dioxide, so, 2, and, significantly, higher, than, the, stability, of, the, hydrate, of, hydrogen, sulfide, h, 2, s, because, of, its, cost, and, radioactivity, experimental, chemical, research, is, seldom, performed, with, radon, and, as, a, result, there, are, very, few, reported, compounds, of, radon, all, either, fluorides, or, oxides, radon, can, be, oxidized, by, powerful, oxidizing, agents, such, as, fluorine, thus, forming, radon, difluoride, rnf, 2, it, decomposes, back, to, its, elements, at, a, temperature, of, above, 523, k, 250, c, 482, f, and, is, reduced, by, water, to, radon, gas, and, hydrogen, fluoride, it, may, also, be, reduced, back, to, its, elements, by, hydrogen, gas, it, has, a, low, volatility, and, was, thought, to, be, rnf, 2, because, of, the, short, half, life, of, radon, and, the, radioactivity, of, its, compounds, it, has, not, been, possible, to, study, the, compound, in, any, detail, theoretical, studies, on, this, molecule, predict, that, it, should, have, a, rn, f, bond, distance, of, 2, 08, ngstr, ms, and, that, the, compound, is, thermodynamically, more, stable, and, less, volatile, than, its, lighter, counterpart, xenon, difluoride, xef, 2, the, octahedral, molecule, rnf, 6, was, predicted, to, have, an, even, lower, enthalpy, of, formation, than, the, difluoride, the, ion, is, believed, to, form, by, the, following, reaction, for, this, reason, antimony, pentafluoride, together, with, chlorine, trifluoride, and, n, 2, f, 2, sb, 2, f, 11, have, been, considered, for, radon, gas, removal, in, uranium, mines, due, to, the, formation, of, radon, fluorine, compounds, radon, compounds, can, be, formed, by, the, decay, of, radium, in, radium, halides, a, reaction, that, has, been, used, to, reduce, the, amount, of, radon, that, escapes, from, targets, during, irradiation, additionally, salts, of, the, cation, with, the, anions, sbf, 6, taf, 6, and, bif, 6, are, known, radon, is, also, oxidised, by, dioxygen, difluoride, to, rnf, 2, at, 173, k, 100, c, 148, f, radon, oxides, are, among, the, few, other, reported, compounds, of, radon, only, the, trioxide, rno, 3, has, been, confirmed, the, higher, fluorides, rnf, 4, and, rnf, 6, have, been, claimed, and, are, calculated, to, be, stable, but, their, identification, is, unclear, they, may, have, been, observed, in, experiments, where, unknown, radon, containing, products, distilled, together, with, xenon, hexafluoride, these, may, have, been, rnf, 4, rnf, 6, or, both, trace, scale, heating, of, radon, with, xenon, fluorine, bromine, pentafluoride, and, either, sodium, fluoride, or, nickel, fluoride, was, claimed, to, produce, a, higher, fluoride, as, well, which, hydrolysed, to, form, rno, 3, while, it, has, been, suggested, that, these, claims, were, really, due, to, radon, precipitating, out, as, the, solid, complex, 2, 2, the, fact, that, radon, coprecipitates, from, aqueous, solution, with, csxeo, 3, f, has, been, taken, as, confirmation, that, rno, 3, was, formed, which, has, been, supported, by, further, studies, of, the, hydrolysed, solution, that, did, not, form, in, other, experiments, may, have, been, due, to, the, high, concentration, of, fluoride, used, electromigration, studies, also, suggest, the, presence, of, cationic, and, anionic, forms, of, radon, in, weakly, acidic, aqueous, solution, ph, 5, the, procedure, having, previously, been, validated, by, examination, of, the, homologous, xenon, trioxide, the, decay, technique, has, also, been, used, avrorin, et, al, reported, in, 1982, that, 212, fr, compounds, cocrystallised, with, their, caesium, analogues, appeared, to, retain, chemically, bound, radon, after, electron, capture, analogies, with, xenon, suggested, the, formation, of, rno, 3, but, this, could, not, be, confirmed, it, is, likely, that, the, difficulty, in, identifying, higher, fluorides, of, radon, stems, from, radon, being, kinetically, hindered, from, being, oxidised, beyond, the, divalent, state, because, of, the, strong, ionicity, of, radon, difluoride, rnf, 2, and, the, high, positive, charge, on, radon, in, rnf, spatial, separation, of, rnf, 2, molecules, may, be, necessary, to, clearly, identify, higher, fluorides, of, radon, of, which, rnf, 4, is, expected, to, be, more, stable, than, rnf, 6, due, to, spin, orbit, splitting, of, the, 6p, shell, of, radon, rn, iv, would, have, a, closed, shell, 6s, 2, 6p, 2, 1, 2, configuration, therefore, while, rnf, 4, should, have, a, similar, stability, to, xenon, tetrafluoride, xef, 4, rnf, 6, would, likely, be, much, less, stable, than, xenon, hexafluoride, xef, 6, radon, hexafluoride, would, also, probably, be, a, regular, octahedral, molecule, unlike, the, distorted, octahedral, structure, of, xef, 6, because, of, the, inert, pair, effect, because, radon, is, quite, electropositive, for, a, noble, gas, it, is, possible, that, radon, fluorides, actually, take, on, highly, fluorine, bridged, structures, and, are, not, volatile, extrapolation, down, the, noble, gas, group, would, suggest, also, the, possible, existence, of, rno, rno, 2, and, rnof, 4, as, well, as, the, first, chemically, stable, noble, gas, chlorides, rncl, 2, and, rncl, 4, but, none, of, these, have, yet, been, found, radon, carbonyl, rnco, has, been, predicted, to, be, stable, and, to, have, a, linear, molecular, geometry, the, molecules, rn, 2, and, rnxe, were, found, to, be, significantly, stabilized, by, spin, orbit, coupling, radon, caged, inside, a, fullerene, has, been, proposed, as, a, drug, for, tumors, despite, the, existence, of, xe, viii, no, rn, viii, compounds, have, been, claimed, to, exist, rnf, 8, should, be, highly, unstable, chemically, xef, 8, is, thermodynamically, unstable, it, is, predicted, that, the, most, stable, rn, viii, compound, would, be, barium, perradonate, ba, 2, rno, 6, analogous, to, barium, perxenate, the, instability, of, rn, viii, is, due, to, the, relativistic, stabilization, of, the, 6s, shell, also, known, as, the, inert, pair, effect, radon, reacts, with, the, liquid, halogen, fluorides, clf, clf, 3, clf, 5, brf, 3, brf, 5, and, if, 7, to, form, rnf, 2, in, halogen, fluoride, solution, radon, is, nonvolatile, and, exists, as, the, rnf, and, rn, 2, cations, addition, of, fluoride, anions, results, in, the, formation, of, the, complexes, rnf, 3, and, rnf, 2, 4, paralleling, the, chemistry, of, beryllium, ii, and, aluminium, iii, the, standard, electrode, potential, of, the, rn, 2, rn, couple, has, been, estimated, as, 2, 0, v, although, there, is, no, evidence, for, the, formation, of, stable, radon, ions, or, compounds, in, aqueous, solution, radon, has, no, stable, isotopes, thirty, nine, radioactive, isotopes, have, been, characterized, with, mass, numbers, ranging, from, 193, to, 231, six, of, them, from, 217, to, 222, inclusive, occur, naturally, the, most, stable, isotope, is, 222, rn, half, life, 3, 82, days, which, is, a, decay, product, of, 226, ra, the, latter, being, itself, a, decay, product, of, 238, u, a, trace, amount, of, the, highly, unstable, isotope, 218, rn, half, life, about, 35, milliseconds, is, also, among, the, daughters, of, 222, rn, the, isotope, 216, rn, would, be, produced, by, the, double, beta, decay, of, natural, 216, po, while, energetically, possible, this, process, has, however, never, been, seen, three, other, radon, isotopes, have, a, half, life, of, over, an, hour, 211, rn, about, 15, hours, 210, rn, 2, 4, hours, and, 224, rn, about, 1, 8, hours, however, none, of, these, three, occur, naturally, 220, rn, also, called, thoron, is, a, natural, decay, product, of, the, most, stable, thorium, isotope, 232, th, it, has, a, half, life, of, 55, 6, seconds, and, also, emits, alpha, radiation, similarly, 219, rn, is, derived, from, the, most, stable, isotope, of, actinium, 227, ac, named, actinon, and, is, an, alpha, emitter, with, a, half, life, of, 3, 96, seconds, no, radon, isotopes, occur, significantly, in, the, neptunium, 237, np, decay, series, though, trace, amounts, of, the, isotopes, 221, rn, 26, minutes, and, 217, rn, 0, 5, millisecond, are, produced, in, minor, branches, 222, rn, belongs, to, the, radium, and, uranium, 238, decay, chain, and, has, a, half, life, of, 3, 8235, days, its, first, four, products, excluding, marginal, decay, schemes, are, very, short, lived, meaning, that, the, corresponding, disintegrations, are, indicative, of, the, initial, radon, distribution, its, decay, goes, through, the, following, sequence, the, radon, equilibrium, factor, is, the, ratio, between, the, activity, of, all, short, period, radon, progenies, which, are, responsible, for, most, of, radon, s, biological, effects, and, the, activity, that, would, be, at, equilibrium, with, the, radon, parent, if, a, closed, volume, is, constantly, supplied, with, radon, the, concentration, of, short, lived, isotopes, will, increase, until, an, equilibrium, is, reached, where, the, overall, decay, rate, of, the, decay, products, equals, that, of, the, radon, itself, the, equilibrium, factor, is, 1, when, both, activities, are, equal, meaning, that, the, decay, products, have, stayed, close, to, the, radon, parent, long, enough, for, the, equilibrium, to, be, reached, within, a, couple, of, hours, under, these, conditions, each, additional, pci, l, of, radon, will, increase, exposure, by, 0, 01, working, level, wl, a, measure, of, radioactivity, commonly, used, in, mining, these, conditions, are, not, always, met, in, many, homes, the, equilibrium, factor, is, typically, 40, that, is, there, will, be, 0, 004, wl, of, daughters, for, each, pci, l, of, radon, in, the, air, 210, pb, takes, much, longer, to, come, in, equilibrium, with, radon, dependent, on, environmental, factors, but, if, the, environment, permits, accumulation, of, dust, over, extended, periods, of, time, 210, pb, and, its, decay, products, may, contribute, to, overall, radiation, levels, as, well, several, studies, on, the, radioactive, equilibrium, of, elements, in, the, environment, find, it, more, useful, to, use, the, ratio, of, other, 222, rn, decay, products, with, 210, pb, such, as, 210, po, in, measuring, overall, radiation, levels, because, of, their, electrostatic, charge, radon, progenies, adhere, to, surfaces, or, dust, particles, whereas, gaseous, radon, does, not, attachment, removes, them, from, the, air, usually, causing, the, equilibrium, factor, in, the, atmosphere, to, be, less, than, 1, the, equilibrium, factor, is, also, lowered, by, air, circulation, or, air, filtration, devices, and, is, increased, by, airborne, dust, particles, including, cigarette, smoke, the, equilibrium, factor, found, in, epidemiological, studies, is, 0, 4, radon, was, discovered, in, 1899, by, ernest, rutherford, and, robert, b, owens, at, mcgill, university, in, montreal, it, was, the, fifth, radioactive, element, to, be, discovered, after, uranium, thorium, radium, and, polonium, in, 1899, pierre, and, marie, curie, observed, that, the, gas, emitted, by, radium, remained, radioactive, for, a, month, later, that, year, rutherford, and, owens, noticed, variations, when, trying, to, measure, radiation, from, thorium, oxide, rutherford, noticed, that, the, compounds, of, thorium, continuously, emit, a, radioactive, gas, that, remains, radioactive, for, several, minutes, and, called, this, gas, emanation, from, latin, emanare, to, flow, out, and, emanatio, expiration, and, later, thorium, emanation, th, em, in, 1900, friedrich, ernst, dorn, reported, some, experiments, in, which, he, noticed, that, radium, compounds, emanate, a, radioactive, gas, he, named, radium, emanation, ra, em, in, 1901, rutherford, and, harriet, brooks, demonstrated, that, the, emanations, are, radioactive, but, credited, the, curies, for, the, discovery, of, the, element, in, 1903, similar, emanations, were, observed, from, actinium, by, andr, louis, debierne, and, were, called, actinium, emanation, ac, em, several, shortened, names, were, soon, suggested, for, the, three, emanations, exradio, exthorio, and, exactinio, in, 1904, radon, ro, thoron, to, and, akton, or, acton, ao, in, 1918, radeon, thoreon, and, actineon, in, 1919, and, eventually, radon, thoron, and, actinon, in, 1920, the, name, radon, is, not, related, to, that, of, the, austrian, mathematician, johann, radon, the, likeness, of, the, spectra, of, these, three, gases, with, those, of, argon, krypton, and, xenon, and, their, observed, chemical, inertia, led, sir, william, ramsay, to, suggest, in, 1904, that, the, emanations, might, contain, a, new, element, of, the, noble, gas, family, in, 1909, ramsay, and, robert, whytlaw, gray, isolated, radon, and, determined, its, melting, temperature, and, approximate, density, in, 1910, they, determined, that, it, was, the, heaviest, known, gas, they, wrote, that, l, expression, l, manation, du, radium, est, fort, incommode, the, expression, radium, emanation, is, very, awkward, and, suggested, the, new, name, niton, nt, from, latin, nitens, shining, to, emphasize, the, radioluminescence, property, and, in, 1912, it, was, accepted, by, the, international, commission, for, atomic, weights, in, 1923, the, international, committee, for, chemical, elements, and, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, iupac, chose, the, name, of, the, most, stable, isotope, radon, as, the, name, of, the, element, the, isotopes, thoron, and, actinon, were, later, renamed, 220, rn, and, 219, rn, this, has, caused, some, confusion, in, the, literature, regarding, the, element, s, discovery, as, while, dorn, had, discovered, radon, the, isotope, he, was, not, the, first, to, discover, radon, the, element, as, late, as, the, 1960s, the, element, was, also, referred, to, simply, as, emanation, the, first, synthesized, compound, of, radon, radon, fluoride, was, obtained, in, 1962, even, today, the, word, radon, may, refer, to, either, the, element, or, its, isotope, 222, rn, with, thoron, remaining, in, use, as, a, short, name, for, 220, rn, to, stem, this, ambiguity, the, name, actinon, for, 219, rn, is, rarely, encountered, today, probably, due, to, the, short, half, life, of, that, isotope, the, danger, of, high, exposure, to, radon, in, mines, where, exposures, can, reach, 1, 000, 000, bq, m, 3, has, long, been, known, in, 1530, paracelsus, described, a, wasting, disease, of, miners, the, mala, metallorum, and, georg, agricola, recommended, ventilation, in, mines, to, avoid, this, mountain, sickness, bergsucht, in, 1879, this, condition, was, identified, as, lung, cancer, by, harting, and, hesse, in, their, investigation, of, miners, from, schneeberg, germany, the, first, major, studies, with, radon, and, health, occurred, in, the, context, of, uranium, mining, in, the, joachimsthal, region, of, bohemia, in, the, us, studies, and, mitigation, only, followed, decades, of, health, effects, on, uranium, miners, of, the, southwestern, us, employed, during, the, early, cold, war, standards, were, not, implemented, until, 1971, in, the, early, 20th, century, in, the, us, gold, contaminated, with, the, radon, daughter, 210, pb, entered, the, jewelry, industry, this, was, from, gold, brachytherapy, seeds, that, had, held, 222, rn, which, were, melted, down, after, the, radon, had, decayed, the, presence, of, radon, in, indoor, air, was, documented, as, early, as, 1950, beginning, in, the, 1970s, research, was, initiated, to, address, sources, of, indoor, radon, determinants, of, concentration, health, effects, and, mitigation, approaches, in, the, us, the, problem, of, indoor, radon, received, widespread, publicity, and, intensified, investigation, after, a, widely, publicized, incident, in, 1984, during, routine, monitoring, at, a, pennsylvania, nuclear, power, plant, a, worker, was, found, to, be, contaminated, with, radioactivity, a, high, concentration, of, radon, in, his, home, was, subsequently, identified, as, responsible, discussions, of, radon, concentrations, in, the, environment, refer, to, 222, rn, the, decay, product, of, uranium, and, radium, while, the, average, rate, of, production, of, 220, rn, from, the, thorium, decay, series, is, about, the, same, as, that, of, 222, rn, the, amount, of, 220, rn, in, the, environment, is, much, less, than, that, of, 222, rn, because, of, the, short, half, life, of, 220, rn, 55, seconds, versus, 3, 8, days, respectively, radon, concentration, in, the, atmosphere, is, usually, measured, in, becquerel, per, cubic, meter, bq, m, 3, the, si, derived, unit, another, unit, of, measurement, common, in, the, us, is, picocuries, per, liter, pci, l, 1, pci, l, 37, bq, m, 3, typical, domestic, exposures, average, about, 48, bq, m, 3, indoors, though, this, varies, widely, and, 15, bq, m, 3, outdoors, in, the, mining, industry, the, exposure, is, traditionally, measured, in, working, level, wl, and, the, cumulative, exposure, in, working, level, month, wlm, 1,

inversion, and, little, wind, high, concentrations, of, radon, can, be, found, in, some, spring, waters, and, hot, springs, the, towns, of, boulder, montana, misasa, bad, kreuznach, germany, and, the, country, of, japan, have, radium, rich, springs, that, emit, radon, to, be, classified, as, a, radon, mineral, water, radon, concentration, must, be, above, 2, nci, l, 74, kbq, m, 3, the, activity, of, radon, mineral, water, reaches, 2, mbq, m, 3, in, merano, and, 4, mbq, m, 3, in, lurisia, italy, natural, radon, concentrations, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, are, so, low, that, radon, rich, water, in, contact, with, the, atmosphere, will, continually, lose, radon, by, volatilization, hence, ground, water, has, a, higher, concentration, of, 222, rn, than, surface, water, because, radon, is, continuously, produced, by, radioactive, decay, of, 226, ra, present, in, rocks, likewise, the, saturated, zone, of, a, soil, frequently, has, a, higher, radon, content, than, the, unsaturated, zone, because, of, diffusional, losses, to, the, atmosphere, in, 1971, apollo, 15, passed, 110, km, 68, mi, above, the, aristarchus, plateau, on, the, moon, and, detected, a, significant, rise, in, alpha, particles, thought, to, be, caused, by, the, decay, of, 222, rn, the, presence, of, 222, rn, has, been, inferred, later, from, data, obtained, from, the, lunar, prospector, alpha, particle, spectrometer, radon, is, found, in, some, petroleum, because, radon, has, a, similar, pressure, and, temperature, curve, to, propane, and, oil, refineries, separate, petrochemicals, based, on, their, boiling, points, the, piping, carrying, freshly, separated, propane, in, oil, refineries, can, become, contaminated, because, of, decaying, radon, and, its, products, residues, from, the, petroleum, and, natural, gas, industry, often, contain, radium, and, its, daughters, the, sulfate, scale, from, an, oil, well, can, be, radium, rich, while, the, water, oil, and, gas, from, a, well, often, contains, radon, radon, decays, to, form, solid, radioisotopes, that, form, coatings, on, the, inside, of, pipework, measurement, of, radon, levels, in, the, first, decades, of, its, discovery, was, mainly, done, to, determine, the, presence, of, radium, and, uranium, in, geological, surveys, in, 1956, most, likely, the, first, indoor, survey, of, radon, decay, products, was, performed, in, sweden, with, the, intent, of, estimating, the, public, exposure, to, radon, and, its, decay, products, from, 1975, up, until, 1984, small, studies, in, sweden, austria, the, united, states, and, norway, aimed, to, measure, radon, indoors, and, in, metropolitan, areas, high, concentrations, of, radon, in, homes, were, discovered, by, chance, in, 1984, after, the, stringent, radiation, testing, conducted, at, the, new, limerick, generating, station, nuclear, power, plant, in, montgomery, county, pennsylvania, united, states, revealed, that, stanley, watras, a, construction, engineer, at, the, plant, was, contaminated, by, radioactive, substances, even, though, the, reactor, had, never, been, fueled, and, watras, had, been, decontaminated, each, evening, it, was, determined, that,

radon, observed, on, lower, floors, the, distribution, of, radon, concentrations, will, generally, differ, from, room, to, room, and, the, readings, are, averaged, according, to, regulatory, protocols, indoor, radon, concentration, is, usually, assumed, to, follow, a, log, normal, distribution, on, a, given, territory, thus, the, geometric, mean, is, generally, used, for, estimating, the, average, radon, concentration, in, an, area, the, mean, concentration, ranges, from, less, than, 10, bq, m, 3, to, over, 100, bq, m, 3, in, some, european, countries, some, of, the, highest, radon,

rapid, decay, radon, is, used, in, hydrologic, research, that, studies, the, interaction, between, groundwater, and, streams, any, significant, concentration, of, radon, in, a, stream, is, a, good, indicator, that, there, are, local, inputs, of, groundwater, radon, soil, concentration, has, been, used, to, map, buried, close, subsurface, geological, faults, because, concentrations, are, generally, higher, over, the, faults, similarly, it, has, found, some, limited, use, in, prospecting, for, geothermal, gradients, some, researchers, have, investigated, changes, in, groundwater, radon, concentrations, for, earthquake, prediction, increases, in, radon, were, noted, before, the, 1966, tashkent, and, 1994, mindoro, earthquakes, radon, has, a, half, life, of, approximately, 3, 8, days, which, means, that, it, can, be, found, only, shortly, after, it, has, been, produced, in, the, radioactive, decay, chain, for, this, reason, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, increases, in, radon, concentration, is, due, to, the, generation, of, new, cracks, underground, which, would, allow, increased, groundwater, circulation, flushing, out, radon, the, generation, of, new, cracks, might, not, unreasonably, be, assumed, to, precede, major, earthquakes, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, scientific, measurements, of, radon, emissions, near, faults, found, that, earthquakes, often, occurred, with, no, radon, signal, and, radon, was, often, detected, with, no, earthquake, to, follow, it, was, then, dismissed, by, many, as, an, unreliable, indicator, as, of, 2009, it, was, under, investigation, as, a, possible, earthquake, precursor, by, nasa, further, research, into, the, subject, has, suggested, that, abnormalities, in, atmospheric, radon, concentrations, can, be, an, indicator, of, seismic, movement, radon, is, a, known, pollutant, emitted, from, geothermal, power, stations, because, it, is, present, in, the, material, pumped, from, deep, underground, it, disperses, rapidly, and, no, radiological, hazard, has, been, demonstrated, in, various, investigations, in, addition, typical, systems, re, inject, the, material, deep, underground, rather, than, releasing, it, at, the, surface, so, its, environmental, impact, is, minimal, in, 1989, a, survey, of, the, collective, dose, received, due, to, radon, in, geothermal, fluids, was, measured, at, 2, man, sieverts, per, gigawatt, year, of, electricity, produced, in, comparison, to, the, 2, 5, man, sieverts, per, gigawatt, year, produced, from, 14, c, emissions, in, nuclear, power, plants, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, radon, produced, from, a, radium, source, was, used, for, industrial, radiography, other, x, ray, sources, such, as, 60, co, and, 192, ir, became, available, after, world, war, ii, and, quickly, replaced, radium, and, thus, radon, for, this, purpose, being, of, lower, cost, and, hazard, 222, rn, decay, products, have, been, classified, by, the, international, agency, for, research, on, cancer, as, being, carcinogenic, to, humans, and, as, a, gas, that, can, be, inhaled, lung, cancer, is, a, particular, concern, for, people, exposed, to, elevated, levels, of, radon, for, sustained, periods, during, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, when, safety, standards, requiring, expensive, ventilation, in, mines, were, not, widely, implemented, radon, exposure, was, linked, to, lung, cancer, among, non, smoking, miners, of, uranium, and, other, hard, rock, materials, in, what, is, now, the, czech, republic, and, later, among, miners, from, the, southwestern, us, and, south, australia, despite, these, hazards, being, known, in, the, early, 1950s, this, occupational, hazard, remained, poorly, managed, in, many, mines, until, the, 1970s, during, this, period, several, entrepreneurs, opened, former, uranium, mines, in, the, us, to, the, general, public, and, advertised, alleged, health, benefits, from, breathing, radon, gas, underground, health, benefits, claimed, included, relief, from, pain, sinus, problems, asthma, and, arthritis, but, the, government, banned, such, advertisements, in, 1975, and, subsequent, works, have, debated, the, truth, of, such, claimed, health, effects, citing, the, documented, ill, effects, of, radiation, on, the, body, since, that, time, ventilation, and, other, measures, have, been, used, to, reduce, radon, levels, in, most, affected, mines, that, continue, to, operate, in, recent, years, the, average, annual, exposure, of, uranium, miners, has, fallen, to, levels, similar, to, the, concentrations, inhaled, in, some, homes, this, has, reduced, the, risk, of, occupationally, induced, cancer, from, radon, although, health, issues, may, persist, for, those, who, are, currently, employed, in, affected, mines, and, for, those, who, have, been, employed, in, them, in, the, past, as, the, relative, risk, for, miners, has, decreased, so, has, the, ability, to, detect, excess, risks, among, that, population, residues, from, processing, of, uranium, ore, can, also, be, a, source, of, radon, radon, resulting, from, the, high, radium, content, in, uncovered, dumps, and, tailing, ponds, can, be, easily, released, into, the, atmosphere, and, affect, people, living, in, the, vicinity, the, release, of, radon, may, be, mitigated, by, covering, tailings, with, soil, or, clay, though, other, decay, products, may, leach, into, groundwater, supplies, non, uranium, mines, may, pose, higher, risks, of, radon, exposure, as, workers, are, not, continuously, monitored, for, radiation, and, regulations, specific, to, uranium, mines, do, not, apply, a, review, of, radon, level, measurements, across, non, uranium, mines, found, the, highest, concentrations, of, radon, in, non, metal, mines, such, as, phosphorus, and, salt, mines, in, addition, to, lung, cancer, researchers, have, theorized, a, possible, increased, risk, of, leukemia, due, to, radon, exposure, empirical, support, from, studies, of, the, general, population, is, inconsistent, a, study, of, uranium, miners, found, a, correlation, between, radon, exposure, and, chronic, lymphocytic, leukemia, and, current, research, supports, a, link, between, indoor, radon, exposure, and, poor, health, outcomes, i, e, an, increased, risk, of, lung, cancer, or, childhood, leukemia, legal, actions, taken, by, those, involved, in, nuclear, industries, including, miners, millers, transporters, nuclear, site, workers, and, their, respective, unions, have, resulted, in, compensation, for, those, affected, by, radon, and, radiation, exposure, under, programs, such, as, the, compensation, scheme, for, radiation, linked, diseases, in, the, united, kingdom, and, the, radiation, exposure, compensation, act, in, the, united, states, radon, has, been, considered, the, second, leading, cause, of, lung, cancer, in, the, united, states, and, leading, environmental, cause, of, cancer, mortality, by, the, epa, with, the, first, one, being, smoking, others, have, reached, similar, conclusions, for, the, united, kingdom, and, france, radon, exposure, in, buildings, may, arise, from, subsurface, rock, formations, and, certain, building, materials, e, g, some, granites, the, greatest, risk, of, radon, exposure, arises, in, buildings, that, are, airtight, insufficiently, ventilated, and, have, foundation, leaks, that, allow, air, from, the, soil, into, basements, and, dwelling, rooms, in, some, regions, such, as, ni, ka, banja, serbia, and, ullensvang, norway, outdoor, radon, concentrations, may, be, exceptionally, high, though, compared, to, indoors, where, people, spend, more, time, and, air, is, not, dispersed, and, exchanged, as, often, outdoor, exposure, to, radon, is, not, considered, a, significant, health, risk, radon, exposure, mostly, radon, daughters, has, been, linked, to, lung, cancer, in, case, control, studies, performed, in, the, us, europe, and, china, there, are, approximately, 21, 000, deaths, per, year, in, the, us, 0, 0063, of, a, population, of, 333, million, due, to, radon, induced, lung, cancers, in, europe, 2, of, all, cancers, have, been, attributed, to, radon, in, slovenia, in, particular, a, country, with, a, high, concentration, of, radon, about, 120, people, 0, 0057, of, a, population, of, 2, 11, million, die, yearly, because, of, radon, one, of, the, most, comprehensive, radon, studies, performed, in, the, us, by, epidemiologist, r, william, field, and, colleagues, found, a, 50, increased, lung, cancer, risk, even, at, the, protracted, exposures, at, the, epa, s, action, level, of, 4, pci, l, north, american, and, european, pooled, analyses, further, support, these, findings, however, the, conclusion, that, exposure, to, low, levels, of, radon, leads, to, elevated, risk, of, lung, cancer, has, been, disputed, and, analyses, of, the, literature, point, towards, elevated, risk, only, when, radon, accumulates, indoors, and, at, levels, above, 100, bq, m, 3, thoron, 220, rn, is, less, studied, than, 222, rn, in, regards, to, domestic, exposure, due, to, its, shorter, half, life, however, it, has, been, measured, at, comparatively, high, concentrations, in, buildings, with, earthen, architecture, such, as, traditional, half, timbered, houses, and, modern, houses, with, clay, wall, finishes, and, in, regions, with, thorium, and, monazite, rich, soil, and, sand, thoron, is, a, minor, contributor, to, the, overall, radiation, dose, received, due, to, indoor, radon, exposure, and, can, interfere, with, 222, rn, measurements, when, not, taken, into, account, who, presented, in, 2009, a, recommended, reference, level, the, national, reference, level, 100, bq, m, 3, for, radon, in, dwellings, the, recommendation, also, says, that, where, this, is, not, possible, 300, bq, m, 3, should, be, selected, as, the, highest, level, a, national, reference, level, should, not, be, a, limit, but, should, represent, the, maximum, acceptable, annual, average, radon, concentration, in, a, dwelling, the, actionable, concentration, of, radon, in, a, home, varies, depending, on, the, organization, doing, the, recommendation, for, example, the, epa, encourages, that, action, be, taken, at, concentrations, as, low, as, 74, bq, m, 3, 2, pci, l, and, the, european, union, recommends, action, be, taken, when, concentrations, reach, 400, bq, m, 3, 11, pci, l, for, old, houses, and, 200, bq, m, 3, 5, pci, l, for, new, ones, on, 8, july, 2010, the, uk, s, health, protection, agency, issued, new, advice, setting, a, target, level, of, 100, bq, m, 3, whilst, retaining, an, action, level, of, 200, bq, m, 3, similar, levels, as, in, uk, are, published, by, norwegian, radiation, and, nuclear, safety, authority, dsa, with, the, maximum, limit, for, schools, kindergartens, and, new, dwellings, set, at, 200, bq, m, 3, where, 100, bq, m, 3, is, set, as, the, action, level, results, from, epidemiological, studies, indicate, that, the, risk, of, lung, cancer, increases, with, exposure, to, residential, radon, a, well, known, example, of, source, of, error, is, smoking, the, main, risk, factor, for, lung, cancer, in, the, us, cigarette, smoking, is, estimated, to, cause, 80, to, 90, of, all, lung, cancers, according, to, the, epa, the, risk, of, lung, cancer, for, smokers, is, significant, due, to, synergistic, effects, of, radon, and, smoking, for, this, population, about, 62, people, in, a, total, of, 1, 000, will, die, of, lung, cancer, compared, to, 7, people, in, a, total, of, 1, 000, for, people, who, have, never, smoked, it, cannot, be, excluded, that, the, risk, of, non, smokers, should, be, primarily, explained, by, an, effect, of, radon, radon, like, other, known, or, suspected, external, risk, factors, for, lung, cancer, is, a, threat, for, smokers, and, former, smokers, this, was, demonstrated, by, the, european, pooling, study, a, commentary, to, the, pooling, study, stated, it, is, not, appropriate, to, talk, simply, of, a, risk, from, radon, in, homes, the, risk, is, from, smoking, compounded, by, a, synergistic, effect, of, radon, for, smokers, without, smoking, the, effect, seems, to, be, so, small, as, to, be, insignificant, according, to, the, european, pooling, study, there, is, a, difference, in, risk, for, the, histological, subtypes, of, lung, cancer, and, radon, exposure, small, cell, lung, carcinoma, which, has, a, high, correlation, with, smoking, has, a, higher, risk, after, radon, exposure, for, other, histological, subtypes, such, as, adenocarcinoma, the, type, that, primarily, affects, non, smokers, the, risk, from, radon, appears, to, be, lower, a, study, of, radiation, from, post, mastectomy, radiotherapy, shows, that, the, simple, models, previously, used, to, assess, the, combined, and, separate, risks, from, radiation, and, smoking, need, to, be, developed, this, is, also, supported, by, new, discussion, about, the, calculation, method, the, linear, no, threshold, model, which, routinely, has, been, used, a, study, from, 2001, which, included, 436, non, smokers, with, lung, cancer, and, a, control, group, of, 1649, non, smokers, without, lung, cancer, showed, that, exposure, to, radon, increased, the, risk, of, lung, cancer, in, non, smokers, the, group, that, had, been, exposed, to, tobacco, smoke, in, the, home, appeared, to, have, a, much, higher, risk, while, those, who, were, not, exposed, to, passive, smoking, did, not, show, any, increased, risk, with, increasing, radon, exposure, the, effects, of, radon, if, ingested, are, unknown, although, studies, have, found, that, its, biological, half, life, ranges, from, 30, to, 70, minutes, with, 90, removal, at, 100, minutes, in, 1999, the, us, national, research, council, investigated, the, issue, of, radon, in, drinking, water, the, risk, associated, with, ingestion, was, considered, almost, negligible, water, from, underground, sources, may, contain, significant, amounts, of, radon, depending, on, the, surrounding, rock, and, soil, conditions, whereas, surface, sources, generally, do, not, radon, is, also, released, from, water, when, temperature, is, increased, pressure, is, decreased, and, when, water, is, aerated, optimum, conditions, for, radon, release, and, exposure, in, domestic, living, from, water, occurred, during, showering, water, with, a, radon, concentration, of, 10, 4, pci, l, can, increase, the, indoor, airborne, radon, concentration, by, 1, pci, l, under, normal, conditions, ocean, surface, concentrations, of, radon, exchange, within, the, atmosphere, causing, 222, rn, to, increase, through, the, air, sea, interface, although, areas, tested, were, very, shallow, additional, measurements, in, a, wide, variety, of, coastal, regimes, should, help, define, the, nature, of, 222, rn, observed, there, are, relatively, simple, tests, for, radon, gas, in, some, countries, these, tests, are, methodically, done, in, areas, of, known, systematic, hazards, radon, detection, devices, are, commercially, available, digital, radon, detectors, provide, ongoing, measurements, giving, both, daily, weekly, short, term, and, long, term, average, readouts, via, a, digital, display, short, term, radon, test, devices, used, for, initial, screening, purposes, are, inexpensive, in, some, cases, free, there, are, important, protocols, for, taking, short, term, radon, tests, and, it, is, imperative, that, they, be, strictly, followed, the, kit, includes, a, collector, that, the, user, hangs, in, the, lowest, habitable, floor, of, the, house, for, two, to, seven, days, the, user, then, sends, the, collector, to, a, laboratory, for, analysis, long, term, kits, taking, collections, for, up, to, one, year, or, more, are, also, available, an, open, land, test, kit, can, test, radon, emissions, from, the, land, before, construction, begins, radon, concentrations, can, vary, daily, and, accurate, radon, exposure, estimates, require, long, term, average, radon, measurements, in, the, spaces, where, an, individual, spends, a, significant, amount, of, time, radon, levels, fluctuate, naturally, due, to, factors, like, transient, weather, conditions, so, an, initial, test, might, not, be, an, accurate, assessment, of, a, home, s, average, radon, level, radon, levels, are, at, a, maximum, during, the, coolest, part, of, the, day, when, pressure, differentials, are, greatest, therefore, a, high, result, over, 4, pci, l, justifies, repeating, the, test, before, undertaking, more, expensive, abatement, projects, measurements, between, 4, and, 10, pci, l, warrant, a, long, term, radon, test, measurements, over, 10, pci, l, warrant, only, another, short, term, test, so, that, abatement, measures, are, not, unduly, delayed, purchasers, of, real, estate, are, advised, to, delay, or, decline, a, purchase, if, the, seller, has, not, successfully, abated, radon, to, 4, pci, l, or, less, because, the, half, life, of, radon, is, only, 3, 8, days, removing, or, isolating, the, source, will, greatly, reduce, the, hazard, within, a, few, weeks, another, method, of, reducing, radon, levels, is, to, modify, the, building, s, ventilation, generally, the, indoor, radon, concentrations, increase, as, ventilation, rates, decrease, in, a, well, ventilated, place, the, radon, concentration, tends, to, align, with, outdoor, values, typically, 10, bq, m, 3, ranging, from, 1, to, 100, bq, m, 3, the, four, principal, ways, of, reducing, the, amount, of, radon, accumulating, in, a, house, are, according, to, the, epa, the, method, to, reduce, radon, primarily, used, is, a, vent, pipe, system, and, fan, which, pulls, radon, from, beneath, the, house, and, vents, it, to, the, outside, which, is, also, called, sub, slab, depressurization, active, soil, depressurization, or, soil, suction, generally, indoor, radon, can, be, mitigated, by, sub, slab, depressurization, and, exhausting, such, radon, laden, air, to, the, outdoors, away, from, windows, and, other, building, openings, epa, generally, recommends, methods, which, prevent, the, entry, of, radon, soil, suction, for, example, prevents, radon, from, entering, your, home, by, drawing, the, radon, from, below, the, home, and, venting, it, through, a, pipe, or, pipes, to, the, air, above, the, home, where, it, is, quickly, diluted, and, the, epa, does, not, recommend, the, use, of, sealing, alone, to, reduce, radon, because, by, itself, sealing, has, not, been, shown, to, lower, radon, levels, significantly, or, consistently, positive, pressure, ventilation, systems, can, be, combined, with, a, heat, exchanger, to, recover, energy, in, the, process, of, exchanging, air, with, the, outside, and, simply, exhausting, basement, air, to, the, outside, is, not, necessarily, a, viable, solution, as, this, can, actually, draw, radon, gas, into, a, dwelling, homes, built, on, a, crawl, space, may, benefit, from, a, radon, collector, installed, under, a, radon, barrier, a, sheet, of, plastic, that, covers, the, crawl, space, for, crawl, spaces, the, epa, states, an, effective, method, to, reduce, radon, levels, in, crawl, space, homes, involves, covering, the, earth, floor, with, a, high, density, plastic, sheet, a, vent, pipe, and, fan, are, used, to, draw, the, radon, from, under, the, sheet, and, vent, it, to, the, outdoors, this, form, of, soil, suction, is, called, submembrane, suction, and, when, properly, applied, is, the, most, effective, way, to, reduce, radon, levels, in, crawl, space, homes
