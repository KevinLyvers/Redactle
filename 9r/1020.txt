nuclear, fission, is, a, reaction, in, which, the, nucleus, of, an, atom, splits, into, two, or, more, smaller, nuclei, the, fission, process, often, produces, gamma, photons, and, releases, a, very, large, amount, of, energy, even, by, the, energetic, standards, of, radioactive, decay, nuclear, fission, was, discovered, by, chemists, otto, hahn, and, fritz, strassmann, and, physicists, lise, meitner, and, otto, robert, frisch, hahn, and, strassmann, proved, that, a, fission, reaction, had, taken, place, on, 19, december, 1938, and, meitner, and, her, nephew, frisch, explained, it, theoretically, in, january, 1939, frisch, named, the, process, fission, by, analogy, with, biological, fission, of, living, cells, in, their, second, publication, on, nuclear, fission, in, february, 1939, hahn, and, strassmann, predicted, the, existence, and, liberation, of, additional, neutrons, during, the, fission, process, opening, up, the, possibility, of, a, nuclear, chain, reaction, for, heavy, nuclides, it, is, an, exothermic, reaction, which, can, release, large, amounts, of, energy, both, as, electromagnetic, radiation, and, as, kinetic, energy, of, the, fragments, heating, the, bulk, material, where, fission, takes, place, like, nuclear, fusion, for, fission, to, produce, energy, the, total, binding, energy, of, the, resulting, elements, must, be, greater, than, that, of, the, starting, element, fission, is, a, form, of, nuclear, transmutation, because, the, resulting, fragments, or, daughter, atoms, are, not, the, same, element, as, the, original, parent, atom, the, two, or, more, nuclei, produced, are, most, often, of, comparable, but, slightly, different, sizes, typically, with, a, mass, ratio, of, products, of, about, 3, to, 2, for, common, fissile, isotopes, most, fissions, are, binary, fissions, producing, two, charged, fragments, but, occasionally, 2, to, 4, times, per, 1000, events, three, positively, charged, fragments, are, produced, in, a, ternary, fission, the, smallest, of, these, fragments, in, ternary, processes, ranges, in, size, from, a, proton, to, an, argon, nucleus, apart, from, fission, induced, by, a, neutron, harnessed, and, exploited, by, humans, a, natural, form, of, spontaneous, radioactive, decay, not, requiring, a, neutron, is, also, referred, to, as, fission, and, occurs, especially, in, very, high, mass, number, isotopes, spontaneous, fission, was, discovered, in, 1940, by, flyorov, petrzhak, and, kurchatov, in, moscow, in, an, experiment, intended, to, confirm, that, without, bombardment, by, neutrons, the, fission, rate, of, uranium, was, negligible, as, predicted, by, niels, bohr, it, was, not, negligible, the, unpredictable, composition, of, the, products, which, vary, in, a, broad, probabilistic, and, somewhat, chaotic, manner, distinguishes, fission, from, purely, quantum, tunneling, processes, such, as, proton, emission, alpha, decay, and, cluster, decay, which, give, the, same, products, each, time, nuclear, fission, produces, energy, for, nuclear, power, and, drives, the, explosion, of, nuclear, weapons, both, uses, are, possible, because, certain, substances, called, nuclear, fuels, undergo, fission, when, struck, by, fission, neutrons, and, in, turn, emit, neutrons, when, they, break, apart, this, makes, a, self, sustaining, nuclear, chain, reaction, possible, releasing, energy, at, a, controlled, rate, in, a, nuclear, reactor, or, at, a, very, rapid, uncontrolled, rate, in, a, nuclear, weapon, the, amount, of, free, energy, released, in, the, fission, of, an, equivalent, amount, of, 235, u, is, a, million, times, more, than, that, released, in, the, combustion, of, methane, or, from, hydrogen, fuel, cells, the, products, of, nuclear, fission, however, are, on, average, far, more, radioactive, than, the, heavy, elements, which, are, normally, fissioned, as, fuel, and, remain, so, for, significant, amounts, of, time, giving, rise, to, a, nuclear, waste, problem, however, the, seven, long, lived, fission, products, make, up, only, a, small, fraction, of, fission, products, neutron, absorption, which, does, not, lead, to, fission, produces, plutonium, from, 238, u, and, minor, actinides, from, both, 235, u, and, 238, u, whose, radiotoxicity, is, far, higher, than, that, of, the, long, lived, fission, products, concerns, over, nuclear, waste, accumulation, and, the, destructive, potential, of, nuclear, weapons, are, a, counterbalance, to, the, peaceful, desire, to, use, fission, as, an, energy, source, the, thorium, fuel, cycle, produces, virtually, no, plutonium, and, much, less, minor, actinides, but, 232, u, or, rather, its, decay, products, are, a, major, gamma, ray, emitter, all, actinides, are, fertile, or, fissile, and, fast, breeder, reactors, can, fission, them, all, albeit, only, in, certain, configurations, nuclear, reprocessing, aims, to, recover, usable, material, from, spent, nuclear, fuel, to, both, enable, uranium, and, thorium, supplies, to, last, longer, and, to, reduce, the, amount, of, waste, the, industry, term, for, a, process, that, fissions, all, or, nearly, all, actinides, is, a, closed, fuel, cycle, younes, and, loveland, define, fission, as, a, collective, motion, of, the, protons, and, neutrons, that, make, up, the, nucleus, and, as, such, it, is, distinguishable, from, other, phenomena, that, break, up, the, nucleus, nuclear, fission, is, an, extreme, example, of, large, amplitude, collective, motion, that, results, in, the, division, of, a, parent, nucleus, into, two, or, more, fragment, nuclei, the, fission, process, can, occur, spontaneously, or, it, can, be, induced, by, an, incident, particle, the, energy, from, a, fission, reaction, is, produced, by, its, fission, products, though, a, large, majority, of, it, about, 85, percent, is, found, in, fragment, kinetic, energy, while, about, 6, percent, each, comes, from, initial, neutrons, and, gamma, rays, and, those, emitted, after, beta, decay, plus, about, 3, percent, from, neutrinos, as, the, product, of, such, decay, 21, 22, 30, nuclear, fission, can, occur, without, neutron, bombardment, as, a, type, of, radioactive, decay, this, type, of, fission, is, called, spontaneous, fission, and, was, first, observed, in, 1940, 22, during, induced, fission, a, compound, system, is, formed, after, an, incident, particle, fuses, with, a, target, the, resultant, excitation, energy, may, be, sufficient, to, emit, neutrons, or, gamma, rays, and, nuclear, scission, fission, into, two, fragments, is, called, binary, fission, and, is, the, most, common, nuclear, reaction, occurring, least, frequently, is, ternary, fission, in, which, a, third, particle, is, emitted, this, third, particle, is, commonly, an, particle, 21, 24, since, in, nuclear, fission, the, nucleus, emits, more, neutrons, than, the, one, it, absorbs, a, chain, reaction, is, possible, 291, 296, binary, fission, may, produce, any, of, the, fission, products, at, 95, 15, and, 135, 15, daltons, however, the, binary, process, happens, merely, because, it, is, the, most, probable, in, anywhere, from, two, to, four, fissions, per, 1000, in, a, nuclear, reactor, ternary, fission, can, produce, three, positively, charged, fragments, plus, neutrons, and, the, smallest, of, these, may, range, from, so, small, a, charge, and, mass, as, a, proton, z, 1, to, as, large, a, fragment, as, argon, z, 18, the, most, common, small, fragments, however, are, composed, of, 90, helium, 4, nuclei, with, more, energy, than, alpha, particles, from, alpha, decay, so, called, long, range, alphas, at, 16, megaelectronvolts, mev, plus, helium, 6, nuclei, and, tritons, the, nuclei, of, tritium, though, less, common, than, binary, fission, it, still, produces, significant, helium, 4, and, tritium, gas, buildup, in, the, fuel, rods, of, modern, nuclear, reactors, bohr, and, wheeler, used, their, liquid, drop, model, the, packing, fraction, curve, of, arthur, jeffrey, dempster, and, eugene, feenberg, s, estimates, of, nucleus, radius, and, surface, tension, to, estimate, the, mass, differences, of, parent, and, daughters, in, fission, they, then, equated, this, mass, difference, to, energy, using, einstein, s, mass, energy, equivalence, formula, the, stimulation, of, the, nucleus, after, neutron, bombardment, was, analogous, to, the, vibrations, of, a, liquid, drop, with, surface, tension, and, the, coulomb, force, in, opposition, plotting, the, sum, of, these, two, energies, as, a, function, of, elongated, shape, they, determined, the, resultant, energy, surface, had, a, saddle, shape, the, saddle, provided, an, energy, barrier, called, the, critical, energy, barrier, energy, of, about, 6, mev, provided, by, the, incident, neutron, was, necessary, to, overcome, this, barrier, and, cause, the, nucleus, to, fission, 10, 11, according, to, john, lilley, the, energy, required, to, overcome, the, barrier, to, fission, is, called, the, activation, energy, or, fission, barrier, and, is, about, 6, mev, for, a, 240, it, is, found, that, the, activation, energy, decreases, as, a, increases, eventually, a, point, is, reached, where, activation, energy, disappears, altogether, it, would, undergo, very, rapid, spontaneous, fission, maria, goeppert, mayer, later, proposed, the, nuclear, shell, model, for, the, nucleus, the, nuclides, that, can, sustain, a, fission, chain, reaction, are, suitable, for, use, as, nuclear, fuels, the, most, common, nuclear, fuels, are, 235, u, the, isotope, of, uranium, with, mass, number, 235, and, of, use, in, nuclear, reactors, and, 239, pu, the, isotope, of, plutonium, with, mass, number, 239, these, fuels, break, apart, into, a, bimodal, range, of, chemical, elements, with, atomic, masses, centering, near, 95, and, 135, daltons, fission, products, most, nuclear, fuels, undergo, spontaneous, fission, only, very, slowly, decaying, instead, mainly, via, an, alpha, beta, decay, chain, over, periods, of, millennia, to, eons, in, a, nuclear, reactor, or, nuclear, weapon, the, overwhelming, majority, of, fission, events, are, induced, by, bombardment, with, another, particle, a, neutron, which, is, itself, produced, by, prior, fission, events, fissionable, isotopes, such, as, uranium, 238, require, additional, energy, provided, by, fast, neutrons, such, as, those, produced, by, nuclear, fusion, in, thermonuclear, weapons, while, some, of, the, neutrons, released, from, the, fission, of, 238, u, are, fast, enough, to, induce, another, fission, in, 238, u, most, are, not, meaning, it, can, never, achieve, criticality, while, there, is, a, very, small, albeit, nonzero, chance, of, a, thermal, neutron, inducing, fission, in, 238, u, neutron, absorption, is, orders, of, magnitude, more, likely, fission, cross, sections, are, a, measurable, property, related, to, the, probability, that, fission, will, occur, in, a, nuclear, reaction, cross, sections, are, a, function, of, incident, neutron, energy, and, those, for, 235, u, and, 239, pu, are, a, million, times, higher, than, 238, u, at, lower, neutron, energy, levels, absorption, of, any, neutron, makes, available, to, the, nucleus, binding, energy, of, about, 5, 3, mev, 238, u, needs, a, fast, neutron, to, supply, the, additional, 1, mev, needed, to, cross, the, critical, energy, barrier, for, fission, in, the, case, of, 235, u, however, that, extra, energy, is, provided, when, 235, u, adjusts, from, an, odd, to, an, even, mass, in, the, words, of, younes, and, lovelace, the, neutron, absorption, on, a, 235, u, target, forms, a, 236, u, nucleus, with, excitation, energy, greater, than, the, critical, fission, energy, whereas, in, the, case, of, n, 238, u, the, resulting, 239, u, nucleus, has, an, excitation, energy, below, the, critical, fission, energy, 25, 28, 282, 287, about, 6, mev, of, the, fission, input, energy, is, supplied, by, the, simple, binding, of, an, extra, neutron, to, the, heavy, nucleus, via, the, strong, force, however, in, many, fissionable, isotopes, this, amount, of, energy, is, not, enough, for, fission, uranium, 238, for, example, has, a, near, zero, fission, cross, section, for, neutrons, of, less, than, 1, mev, energy, if, no, additional, energy, is, supplied, by, any, other, mechanism, the, nucleus, will, not, fission, but, will, merely, absorb, the, neutron, as, happens, when, 238, u, absorbs, slow, and, even, some, fraction, of, fast, neutrons, to, become, 239, u, the, remaining, energy, to, initiate, fission, can, be, supplied, by, two, other, mechanisms, one, of, these, is, more, kinetic, energy, of, the, incoming, neutron, which, is, increasingly, able, to, fission, a, fissionable, heavy, nucleus, as, it, exceeds, a, kinetic, energy, of, 1, mev, or, more, so, called, fast, neutrons, such, high, energy, neutrons, are, able, to, fission, 238, u, directly, see, thermonuclear, weapon, for, application, where, the, fast, neutrons, are, supplied, by, nuclear, fusion, however, this, process, cannot, happen, to, a, great, extent, in, a, nuclear, reactor, as, too, small, a, fraction, of, the, fission, neutrons, produced, by, any, type, of, fission, have, enough, energy, to, efficiently, fission, 238, u, fission, neutrons, have, a, mode, energy, of, 2, mev, but, a, median, of, only, 0, 75, mev, meaning, half, of, them, have, less, than, this, insufficient, energy, among, the, heavy, actinide, elements, however, those, isotopes, that, have, an, odd, number, of, neutrons, such, as, 235, u, with, 143, neutrons, bind, an, extra, neutron, with, an, additional, 1, to, 2, mev, of, energy, over, an, isotope, of, the, same, element, with, an, even, number, of, neutrons, such, as, 238, u, with, 146, neutrons, this, extra, binding, energy, is, made, available, as, a, result, of, the, mechanism, of, neutron, pairing, effects, which, itself, is, caused, by, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, allowing, an, extra, neutron, to, occupy, the, same, nuclear, orbital, as, the, last, neutron, in, the, nucleus, in, such, isotopes, therefore, no, neutron, kinetic, energy, is, needed, for, all, the, necessary, energy, is, supplied, by, absorption, of, any, neutron, either, of, the, slow, or, fast, variety, the, former, are, used, in, moderated, nuclear, reactors, and, the, latter, are, used, in, fast, neutron, reactors, and, in, weapons, according, to, younes, and, loveland, actinides, like, 235, u, that, fission, easily, following, the, absorption, of, a, thermal, 0, 25, mev, neutron, are, called, fissile, whereas, those, like, 238, u, that, do, not, easily, fission, when, they, absorb, a, thermal, neutron, are, called, fissionable, 25, after, an, incident, particle, has, fused, with, a, parent, nucleus, if, the, excitation, energy, is, sufficient, the, nucleus, breaks, into, fragments, this, is, called, scission, and, occurs, at, about, 10, 20, seconds, the, fragments, can, emit, prompt, neutrons, at, between, 10, 18, and, 10, 15, seconds, at, about, 10, 11, seconds, the, fragments, can, emit, gamma, rays, at, 10, 3, seconds, decay, delayed, neutrons, and, gamma, rays, are, emitted, from, the, decay, products, 23, 24, typical, fission, events, release, about, two, hundred, million, ev, 200, mev, of, energy, the, equivalent, of, roughly, 2, trillion, kelvin, for, each, fission, event, the, exact, isotope, which, is, fissioned, and, whether, or, not, it, is, fissionable, or, fissile, has, only, a, small, impact, on, the, amount, of, energy, released, this, can, be, easily, seen, by, examining, the, curve, of, binding, energy, image, below, and, noting, that, the, average, binding, energy, of, the, actinide, nuclides, beginning, with, uranium, is, around, 7, 6, mev, per, nucleon, looking, further, left, on, the, curve, of, binding, energy, where, the, fission, products, cluster, it, is, easily, observed, that, the, binding, energy, of, the, fission, products, tends, to, center, around, 8, 5, mev, per, nucleon, thus, in, any, fission, event, of, an, isotope, in, the, actinide, mass, range, roughly, 0, 9, mev, are, released, per, nucleon, of, the, starting, element, the, fission, of, 235, u, by, a, slow, neutron, yields, nearly, identical, energy, to, the, fission, of, 238, u, by, a, fast, neutron, this, energy, release, profile, holds, for, thorium, and, the, various, minor, actinides, as, well, when, a, uranium, nucleus, fissions, into, two, daughter, nuclei, fragments, about, 0, 1, percent, of, the, mass, of, the, uranium, nucleus, appears, as, the, fission, energy, of, 200, mev, for, uranium, 235, total, mean, fission, energy, 202, 79, mev, typically, 169, mev, appears, as, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, daughter, nuclei, which, fly, apart, at, about, 3, of, the, speed, of, light, due, to, coulomb, repulsion, also, an, average, of, 2, 5, neutrons, are, emitted, with, a, mean, kinetic, energy, per, neutron, of, 2, mev, total, of, 4, 8, mev, the, fission, reaction, also, releases, 7, mev, in, prompt, gamma, ray, photons, the, latter, figure, means, that, a, nuclear, fission, explosion, or, criticality, accident, emits, about, 3, 5, of, its, energy, as, gamma, rays, less, than, 2, 5, of, its, energy, as, fast, neutrons, total, of, both, types, of, radiation, 6, and, the, rest, as, kinetic, energy, of, fission, fragments, this, appears, almost, immediately, when, the, fragments, impact, surrounding, matter, as, simple, heat, some, processes, involving, neutrons, are, notable, for, absorbing, or, finally, yielding, energy, for, example, neutron, kinetic, energy, does, not, yield, heat, immediately, if, the, neutron, is, captured, by, a, uranium, 238, atom, to, breed, plutonium, 239, but, this, energy, is, emitted, if, the, plutonium, 239, is, later, fissioned, on, the, other, hand, so, called, delayed, neutrons, emitted, as, radioactive, decay, products, with, half, lives, up, to, several, minutes, from, fission, daughters, are, very, important, to, reactor, control, because, they, give, a, characteristic, reaction, time, for, the, total, nuclear, reaction, to, double, in, size, if, the, reaction, is, run, in, a, delayed, critical, zone, which, deliberately, relies, on, these, neutrons, for, a, supercritical, chain, reaction, one, in, which, each, fission, cycle, yields, more, neutrons, than, it, absorbs, without, their, existence, the, nuclear, chain, reaction, would, be, prompt, critical, and, increase, in, size, faster, than, it, could, be, controlled, by, human, intervention, in, this, case, the, first, experimental, atomic, reactors, would, have, run, away, to, a, dangerous, and, messy, prompt, critical, reaction, before, their, operators, could, have, manually, shut, them, down, for, this, reason, designer, enrico, fermi, included, radiation, counter, triggered, control, rods, suspended, by, electromagnets, which, could, automatically, drop, into, the, center, of, chicago, pile, 1, if, these, delayed, neutrons, are, captured, without, producing, fissions, they, produce, heat, as, well, the, binding, energy, of, the, nucleus, is, the, difference, between, the, rest, mass, energy, of, the, nucleus, and, the, rest, mass, energy, of, the, neutron, and, proton, nucleons, the, binding, energy, formula, includes, volume, surface, and, coulomb, energy, terms, that, include, empirically, derived, coefficients, for, all, three, plus, energy, ratios, of, a, deformed, nucleus, relative, to, a, spherical, form, for, the, surface, and, coulomb, terms, additional, terms, can, be, included, such, as, symmetry, pairing, the, finite, range, of, the, nuclear, force, and, charge, distribution, within, the, nuclei, to, improve, the, estimate, 46, 50, normally, binding, energy, is, referred, to, and, plotted, as, average, binding, energy, per, nucleon, according, to, lilley, the, binding, energy, of, a, nucleus, b, is, the, energy, required, to, separate, it, into, its, constituent, neutrons, and, protons, m, a, z, z, m, h, n, m, n, b, c, 2, displaystyle, m, mathbf, a, mathbf, z, mathbf, z, m, h, mathbf, n, m, n, mathbf, b, c, 2, where, a, is, mass, number, z, is, atomic, number, m, h, is, the, atomic, mass, of, a, hydrogen, atom, m, n, is, the, mass, of, a, neutron, and, c, is, the, speed, of, light, thus, the, mass, of, an, atom, is, less, than, the, mass, of, its, constituent, protons, and, neutrons, assuming, the, average, binding, energy, of, its, electrons, is, negligible, the, binding, energy, b, is, expressed, in, energy, units, using, einstein, s, mass, energy, equivalence, relationship, the, binding, energy, also, provides, an, estimate, of, the, total, energy, released, from, fission, the, curve, of, binding, energy, is, characterized, by, a, broad, maximum, near, mass, number, 60, at, 8, 6, mev, then, gradually, decreases, to, 7, 6, mev, at, the, highest, mass, numbers, mass, numbers, higher, than, 238, are, rare, at, the, lighter, end, of, the, scale, peaks, are, noted, for, helium, 4, and, the, multiples, such, as, beryllium, 8, carbon, 12, oxygen, 16, neon, 20, and, magnesium, 24, binding, energy, due, to, the, nuclear, force, approaches, a, constant, value, for, large, a, while, the, coulomb, acts, over, a, larger, distance, so, that, electrical, potential, energy, per, proton, grows, as, z, increases, fission, energy, is, released, when, a, a, is, larger, than, 120, nucleus, fragments, fusion, energy, is, released, when, lighter, nuclei, combine, carl, friedrich, von, weizs, cker, s, semi, empirical, mass, formula, may, be, used, to, express, the, binding, energy, as, the, sum, of, five, terms, which, are, the, volume, energy, a, surface, correction, coulomb, energy, a, symmetry, term, and, a, pairing, term, b, a, v, a, a, s, a, 2, 3, a, c, z, 2, a, 1, 3, a, a, n, z, 2, a, displaystyle, b, a, v, mathbf, a, a, s, mathbf, a, 2, 3, a, c, frac, mathbf, z, 2,

interact, with, fewer, nucleons, reducing, the, effect, of, the, volume, term, according, to, lilley, for, all, naturally, occurring, nuclei, the, surface, energy, term, dominates, and, the, nucleus, exists, in, a, state, of, equilibrium, the, negative, contribution, of, coulomb, energy, arises, from, the, repulsive, electric, force, of, the, protons, the, symmetry, term, arises, from, the, fact, that, effective, forces, in, the, nucleus, are, stronger, for, unlike, neutron, proton, pairs, rather, than, like, neutron, neutron, or, proton, proton, pairs, the, pairing, term, arises, from, the, fact, that, like, nucleons, form, spin, zero, pairs, in, the, same, spatial, state, the, pairing, is, positive, if, n, and, z, are, both, even, adding, to, the, binding, energy, in, fission, there, is, a, preference, for, fission, fragments, with, even, z, which, is, called, the, odd, even, effect, on, the, fragments, charge, distribution, this, can, be, seen, in, the, empirical, fragment, yield, data, for, each, fission, product, as, products, with, even, z, have, higher, yield, values, however, no, odd, even, effect, is, observed, on, fragment, distribution, based, on, their, a, this, result, is, attributed, to, nucleon, pair, breaking, in, nuclear, fission, events, the, nuclei, may, break, into, any, combination, of, lighter, nuclei, but, the, most, common, event, is, not, fission, to, equal, mass, nuclei, of, about, mass, 120, the, most, common, event, depending, on, isotope, and, process, is, a, slightly, unequal, fission, in, which, one, daughter, nucleus, has, a, mass, of, about, 90, to, 100, daltons, and, the, other, the, remaining, 130, to, 140, daltons, stable, nuclei, and, unstable, nuclei, with, very, long, half, lives, follow, a, trend, of, stability, evident, when, z, is, plotted, against, n, for, lighter, nuclei, less, than, n, 20, the, line, has, the, slope, n, z, while, the, heavier, nuclei, require, additional, neutrons, to, remain, stable, nuclei, that, are, neutron, or, proton, rich, have, excessive, binding, energy, for, stability, and, the, excess, energy, may, convert, a, neutron, to, a, proton, or, a, proton, to, a, neutron, via, the, weak, nuclear, force, a, process, known, as, beta, decay, neutron, induced, fission, of, u, 235, emits, a, total, energy, of, 207, mev, of, which, about, 200, mev, is, recoverable, prompt, fission, fragments, amount, to, 168, mev, which, are, easily, stopped, with, a, fraction, of, a, millimeter, prompt, neutrons, total, 5, mev, and, this, energy, is, recovered, as, heat, via, scattering, in, the, reactor, however, many, fission, fragments, are, neutron, rich, and, decay, via, emissions, according, to, lilley, the, radioactive, decay, energy, from, the, fission, chains, is, the, second, release, of, energy, due, to, fission, it, is, much, less, than, the, prompt, energy, but, it, is, a, significant, amount, and, is, why, reactors, must, continue, to, be, cooled, after, they, have, been, shut, down, and, why, the, waste, products, must, be, handled, with, great, care, and, stored, safely, john, lilley, states, neutron, induced, fission, generates, extra, neutrons, which, can, induce, further, fissions, in, the, next, generation, and, so, on, in, a, chain, reaction, the, chain, reaction, is, characterized, by, the, neutron, multiplication, factor, k, which, is, defined, as, the, ratio, of, the, number, of, neutrons, in, one, generation, to, the, number, in, the, preceding, generation, if, in, a, reactor, k, is, less, than, unity, the, reactor, is, subcritical, the, number, of, neutrons, decreases, and, the, chain, reaction, dies, out, if, k, 1, the, reactor, is, supercritical, and, the, chain, reaction, diverges, this, is, the, situation, in, a, fission, bomb, where, growth, is, at, an, explosive, rate, if, k, is, exactly, unity, the, reactions, proceed, at, a, steady, rate, and, the, reactor, is, said, to, be, critical, it, is, possible, to, achieve, criticality, in, a, reactor, using, natural, uranium, as, fuel, provided, that, the, neutrons, have, been, efficiently, moderated, to, thermal, energies, moderators, include, light, water, heavy, water, and, graphite, 269, 274, according, to, john, c, lee, for, all, nuclear, reactors, in, operation, and, those, under, development, the, nuclear, fuel, cycle, is, based, on, one, of, three, fissile, materials, 235, u, 233, u, and, 239, pu, and, the, associated, isotopic, chains, for, the, current, generation, of, lwrs, the, enriched, u, contains, 2, 5, 4, 5, wt, of, 235, u, which, is, fabricated, into, uo, 2, fuel, rods, and, loaded, into, fuel, assemblies, lee, states, one, important, comparison, for, the, three, major, fissile, nuclides, 235, u, 233, u, and, 239, pu, is, their, breeding, potential, a, breeder, is, by, definition, a, reactor, that, produces, more, fissile, material, than, it, consumes, and, needs, a, minimum, of, two, neutrons, produced, for, each, neutron, absorbed, in, a, fissile, nucleus, thus, in, general, the, conversion, ratio, cr, is, defined, as, the, ratio, of, fissile, material, produced, to, that, destroyed, when, the, cr, is, greater, than, 1, 0, it, is, called, the, breeding, ratio, br, 233, u, offers, a, superior, breeding, potential, for, both, thermal, and, fast, reactors, while, 239, pu, offers, a, superior, breeding, potential, for, fast, reactors, critical, fission, reactors, are, the, most, common, type, of, nuclear, reactor, in, a, critical, fission, reactor, neutrons, produced, by, fission, of, fuel, atoms, are, used, to, induce, yet, more, fissions, to, sustain, a, controllable, amount, of, energy, release, devices, that, produce, engineered, but, non, self, sustaining, fission, reactions, are, subcritical, fission, reactors, such, devices, use, radioactive, decay, or, particle, accelerators, to, trigger, fissions, critical, fission, reactors, are, built, for, three, primary, purposes, which, typically, involve, different, engineering, trade, offs, to, take, advantage, of, either, the, heat, or, the, neutrons, produced, by, the, fission, chain, reaction, while, in, principle, all, fission, reactors, can, act, in, all, three, capacities, in, practice, the, tasks, lead, to, conflicting, engineering, goals, and, most, reactors, have, been, built, with, only, one, of, the, above, tasks, in, mind, there, are, several, early, counter, examples, such, as, the, hanford, n, reactor, now, decommissioned, as, of, 2019, the, 448, nuclear, power, plants, worldwide, provided, a, capacity, of, 398, gwe, with, about, 85, being, light, water, cooled, reactors, such, as, pressurized, water, reactors, or, boiling, water, reactors, energy, from, fission, is, transmitted, through, conduction, or, convection, to, the, nuclear, reactor, coolant, then, to, a, heat, exchanger, and, the, resultant, generated, steam, is, used, to, drive, a, turbine, or, generator, 1, 4, the, objective, of, an, atomic, bomb, is, to, produce, a, device, according, to, serber, in, which, energy, is, released, by, a, fast, neutron, chain, reaction, in, one, or, more, of, the, materials, known, to, show, nuclear, fission, according, to, rhodes, untamped, a, bomb, core, even, as, large, as, twice, the, critical, mass, would, completely, fission, less, than, 1, percent, of, its, nuclear, material, before, it, expanded, enough, to, stop, the, chain, reaction, from, proceeding, tamper, always, increased, efficiency, it, reflected, neutrons, back, into, the, core, and, its, inertia, slowed, the, core, s, expansion, and, helped, keep, the, core, surface, from, blowing, away, rearrangement, of, the, core, material, s, subcritical, components, would, need, to, proceed, as, fast, as, possible, to, ensure, effective, detonation, additionally, a, third, basic, component, was, necessary, an, initiator, a, ra, be, source, or, better, a, po, be, source, with, the, radium, or, polonium, attached, perhaps, to, one, piece, of, the, core, and, the, beryllium, to, the, other, to, smash, together, and, spray, neutrons, when, the, parts, mated, to, start, the, chain, reaction, however, any, bomb, would, necessitate, locating, mining, and, processing, hundreds, of, tons, of, uranium, ore, while, u, 235, separation, or, the, production, of, pu, 239, would, require, additional, industrial, capacity, 460, 463, the, discovery, of, nuclear, fission, occurred, in, 1938, in, the, buildings, of, the, kaiser, wilhelm, society, for, chemistry, today, part, of, the, free, university, of, berlin, following, over, four, decades, of, work, on, the, science, of, radioactivity, and, the, elaboration, of, new, nuclear, physics, that, described, the, components, of, atoms, in, 1911, ernest, rutherford, proposed, a, model, of, the, atom, in, which, a, very, small, dense, and, positively, charged, nucleus, of, protons, was, surrounded, by, orbiting, negatively, charged, electrons, the, rutherford, model, niels, bohr, improved, upon, this, in, 1913, by, reconciling, the, quantum, behavior, of, electrons, the, bohr, model, in, 1928, george, gamow, proposed, the, liquid, drop, model, which, became, essential, to, understanding, the, physics, of, fission, 49, 51, 70, 77, 228, 6, 7, in, 1896, henri, becquerel, had, found, and, marie, curie, named, radioactivity, in, 1900, rutherford, and, frederick, soddy, investigating, the, radioactive, gas, emanating, from, thorium, conveyed, the, tremendous, and, inevitable, conclusion, that, the, element, thorium, was, slowly, and, spontaneously, transmuting, itself, into, argon, gas, 41, 43, in, 1919, following, up, on, an, earlier, anomaly, ernest, marsden, noted, in, 1915, rutherford, attempted, to, break, up, the, atom, rutherford, was, able, to, accomplish, the, first, artificial, transmutation, of, nitrogen, into, oxygen, using, alpha, particles, directed, at, nitrogen, 14, n, 17, o, p, rutherford, stated, we, must, conclude, that, the, nitrogen, atom, is, disintegrated, while, the, newspapers, stated, he, had, split, the, atom, this, was, the, first, observation, of, a, nuclear, reaction, that, is, a, reaction, in, which, particles, from, one, decay, are, used, to, transform, another, atomic, nucleus, it, also, offered, a, new, way, to, study, the, nucleus, rutherford, and, james, chadwick, then, used, alpha, particles, to, disintegrate, boron, fluorine, sodium, aluminum, and, phosphorus, before, reaching, a, limitation, associated, with, the, energy, of, his, alpha, particle, source, eventually, in, 1932, a, fully, artificial, nuclear, reaction, and, nuclear, transmutation, was, achieved, by, rutherford, s, colleagues, ernest, walton, and, john, cockcroft, who, used, artificially, accelerated, protons, against, lithium, 7, to, split, this, nucleus, into, two, alpha, particles, the, feat, was, popularly, known, as, splitting, the, atom, and, would, win, them, the, 1951, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, transmutation, of, atomic, nuclei, by, artificially, accelerated, atomic, particles, although, it, was, not, the, nuclear, fission, reaction, later, discovered, in, heavy, elements, english, physicist, james, chadwick, discovered, the, neutron, in, 1932, chadwick, used, an, ionization, chamber, to, observe, protons, knocked, out, of, several, elements, by, beryllium, radiation, following, up, on, earlier, observations, made, by, joliot, curies, in, chadwick, s, words, in, order, to, explain, the, great, penetrating, power, of, the, radiation, we, must, further, assume, that, the, particle, has, no, net, charge, the, existence, of, the, neutron, was, first, postulated, by, rutherford, in, 1920, and, in, the, words, of, chadwick, how, on, earth, were, you, going, to, build, up, a, big, nucleus, with, a, large, positive, charge, and, the, answer, was, a, neutral, particle, 153, 165, subsequently, he, communicated, his, findings, in, more, detail, in, the, words, of, richard, rhodes, referring, to, the, neutron, it, would, therefore, serve, as, a, new, nuclear, probe, of, surpassing, power, of, penetration, philip, morrison, stated, a, beam, of, thermal, neutrons, moving, at, about, the, speed, of, sound, produces, nuclear, reactions, in, many, materials, much, more, easily, than, a, beam, of, protons, traveling, thousands, of, times, faster, according, to, rhodes, slowing, down, a, neutron, gave, it, more, time, in, the, vicinity, of, the, nucleus, and, that, gave, it, more, time, to, be, captured, fermi, s, team, studying, radiative, capture, which, is, the, emission, of, gamma, radiation, after, the, nucleus, captures, a, neutron, studied, sixty, elements, inducing, radioactivity, in, forty, in, the, process, they, discovered, the, ability, of, hydrogen, to, slow, down, the, neutrons, 165, 216, 220, enrico, fermi, and, his, colleagues, in, rome, studied, the, results, of, bombarding, uranium, with, neutrons, in, 1934, fermi, concluded, that, his, experiments, had, created, new, elements, with, 93, and, 94, protons, which, the, group, dubbed, ausenium, and, hesperium, however, not, all, were, convinced, by, fermi, s, analysis, of, his, results, though, he, would, win, the, 1938, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, his, demonstrations, of, the, existence, of, new, radioactive, elements, produced, by, neutron, irradiation, and, for, his, related, discovery, of, nuclear, reactions, brought, about, by, slow, neutrons, the, german, chemist, ida, noddack, notably, suggested, in, 1934, that, instead, of, creating, a, new, heavier, element, 93, that, it, is, conceivable, that, the, nucleus, breaks, up, into, several, large, fragments, however, the, quoted, objection, comes, some, distance, down, and, was, but, one, of, several, gaps, she, noted, in, fermi, s, claim, although, noddack, was, a, renowned, analytical, chemist, she, lacked, the, background, in, physics, to, appreciate, the, enormity, of, what, she, was, proposing, after, the, fermi, publication, otto, hahn, lise, meitner, and, fritz, strassmann, began, performing, similar, experiments, in, berlin, meitner, an, austrian, jew, lost, her, austrian, citizenship, with, the, anschluss, the, union, of, austria, with, germany, in, march, 1938, but, she, fled, in, july, 1938, to, sweden, and, started, a, correspondence, by, mail, with, hahn, in, berlin, by, coincidence, her, nephew, otto, robert, frisch, also, a, refugee, was, also, in, sweden, when, meitner, received, a, letter, from, hahn, dated, 19, december, describing, his, chemical, proof, that, some, of, the, product, of, the, bombardment, of, uranium, with, neutrons, was, barium, hahn, suggested, a, bursting, of, the, nucleus, but, he, was, unsure, of, what, the, physical, basis, for, the, results, were, barium, had, an, atomic, mass, 40, less, than, uranium, and, no, previously, known, methods, of, radioactive, decay, could, account, for, such, a, large, difference, in, the, mass, of, the, nucleus, frisch, was, skeptical, but, meitner, trusted, hahn, s, ability, as, a, chemist, marie, curie, had, been, separating, barium, from, radium, for, many, years, and, the, techniques, were, well, known, meitner, and, frisch, then, correctly, interpreted, hahn, s, results, to, mean, that, the, nucleus, of, uranium, had, split, roughly, in, half, frisch, suggested, the, process, be, named, nuclear, fission, by, analogy, to, the, process, of, living, cell, division, into, two, cells, which, was, then, called, binary, fission, just, as, the, term, nuclear, chain, reaction, would, later, be, borrowed, from, chemistry, so, the, term, fission, was, borrowed, from, biology, news, spread, quickly, of, the, new, discovery, which, was, correctly, seen, as, an, entirely, novel, physical, effect, with, great, scientific, and, potentially, practical, possibilities, meitner, s, and, frisch, s, interpretation, of, the, discovery, of, hahn, and, strassmann, crossed, the, atlantic, ocean, with, niels, bohr, who, was, to, lecture, at, princeton, university, i, i, rabi, and, willis, lamb, two, columbia, university, physicists, working, at, princeton, heard, the, news, and, carried, it, back, to, columbia, rabi, said, he, told, enrico, fermi, fermi, gave, credit, to, lamb, bohr, soon, thereafter, went, from, princeton, to, columbia, to, see, fermi, not, finding, fermi, in, his, office, bohr, went, down, to, the, cyclotron, area, and, found, herbert, l, anderson, bohr, grabbed, him, by, the, shoulder, and, said, young, man, let, me, explain, to, you, about, something, new, and, exciting, in, physics, it, was, clear, to, a, number, of, scientists, at, columbia, that, they, should, try, to, detect, the, energy, released, in, the, nuclear, fission, of, uranium, from, neutron, bombardment, on, 25, january, 1939, a, columbia, university, team, conducted, the, first, nuclear, fission, experiment, in, the, united, states, which, was, done, in, the, basement, of, pupin, hall, the, experiment, involved, placing, uranium, oxide, inside, of, an, ionization, chamber, and, irradiating, it, with, neutrons, and, measuring, the, energy, thus, released, the, results, confirmed, that, fission, was, occurring, and, hinted, strongly, that, it, was, the, isotope, uranium, 235, in, particular, that, was, fissioning, the, next, day, the, fifth, washington, conference, on, theoretical, physics, began, in, washington, d, c, under, the, joint, auspices, of, the, george, washington, university, and, the, carnegie, institution, of, washington, there, the, news, on, nuclear, fission, was, spread, even, further, which, fostered, many, more, experimental, demonstrations, the, 6, january, 1939, hahn, and, strassman, paper, announced, the, discover, of, fission, in, their, second, publication, on, nuclear, fission, in, february, 1939, hahn, and, strassmann, used, the, term, uranspaltung, uranium, fission, for, the, first, time, and, predicted, the, existence, and, liberation, of, additional, neutrons, during, the, fission, process, opening, up, the, possibility, of, a, nuclear, chain, reaction, the, 11, february, 1939, paper, by, meitner, and, frisch, compared, the, process, to, the, division, of, a, liquid, drop, and, estimated, the, energy, released, at, 200, mev, the, 1, september, 1939, paper, by, bohr, and, wheeler, used, this, liquid, drop, model, to, quantify, fission, details, including, the, energy, released, estimated, the, cross, section, for, neutron, induced, fission, and, deduced, 235, u, was, the, major, contributor, to, that, cross, section, and, slow, neutron, fission, 262, 311, 9, 13, during, this, period, the, hungarian, physicist, le, szil, rd, realized, that, the, neutron, driven, fission, of, heavy, atoms, could, be, used, to, create, a, nuclear, chain, reaction, such, a, reaction, using, neutrons, was, an, idea, he, had, first, formulated, in, 1933, upon, reading, rutherford, s, disparaging, remarks, about, generating, power, from, neutron, collisions, however, szil, rd, had, not, been, able, to, achieve, a, neutron, driven, chain, reaction, using, beryllium, szilard, stated, if, we, could, find, an, element, which, is, split, by, neutrons, and, which, would, emit, two, neutrons, when, it, absorbs, one, neutron, such, an, element, if, assembled, in, sufficiently, large, mass, could, sustain, a, nuclear, chain, reaction, on, 25, january, 1939, after, learning, of, hahn, s, discovery, from, eugene, wigner, szilard, noted, if, enough, neutrons, are, emitted, then, it, should, be, of, course, possible, to, sustain, a, chain, reaction, all, of, the, things, which, h, g, wells, predicted, appeared, suddenly, real, to, me, after, the, hahn, strassman, paper, was, published, szilard, noted, in, a, letter, to, lewis, strauss, that, during, the, fission, of, uranium, the, energy, released, in, this, new, reaction, must, be, very, much, higher, than, all, previously, known, cases, which, might, lead, to, large, scale, production, of, energy, and, radioactive, elements, unfortunately, also, perhaps, to, atomic, bombs, 26, 28, 203, 204, 213, 214, 223, 225, 267, 268, szilard, now, urged, fermi, in, new, york, and, fr, d, ric, joliot, curie, in, paris, to, refrain, from, publishing, on, the, possibility, of, a, chain, reaction, lest, the, nazi, government, become, aware, of, the, possibilities, on, the, eve, of, what, would, later, be, known, as, world, war, ii, with, some, hesitation, fermi, agreed, to, self, censor, but, joliot, curie, did, not, and, in, april, 1939, his, team, in, paris, including, hans, von, halban, and, lew, kowarski, reported, in, the, journal, nature, that, the, number, of, neutrons, emitted, with, nuclear, fission, of, uranium, was, then, reported, at, 3, 5, per, fission, szilard, and, walter, zinn, found, the, number, of, neutrons, emitted, by, fission, to, be, about, two, fermi, and, anderson, estimated, a, yield, of, about, two, neutrons, per, each, neutron, captured, 290, 291, 295, 296, with, the, news, of, fission, neutrons, from, uranium, fission, szil, rd, immediately, understood, the, possibility, of, a, nuclear, chain, reaction, using, uranium, in, the, summer, fermi, and, szilard, proposed, the, idea, of, a, nuclear, reactor, pile, to, mediate, this, process, the, pile, would, use, natural, uranium, as, fuel, fermi, had, shown, much, earlier, that, neutrons, were, far, more, effectively, captured, by, atoms, if, they, were, of, low, energy, so, called, slow, or, thermal, neutrons, because, for, quantum, reasons, it, made, the, atoms, look, like, much, larger, targets, to, the, neutrons, thus, to, slow, down, the, secondary, neutrons, released, by, the, fissioning, uranium, nuclei, fermi, and, szilard, proposed, a, graphite, moderator, against, which, the, fast, high, energy, secondary, neutrons, would, collide, effectively, slowing, them, down, with, enough, uranium, and, with, sufficiently, pure, graphite, their, pile, could, theoretically, sustain, a, slow, neutron, chain, reaction, this, would, result, in, the, production, of, heat, as, well, as, the, creation, of, radioactive, fission, products, 291, 298, 302, in, august, 1939, szilard, teller, and, wigner, thought, that, the, germans, might, make, use, of, the, fission, chain, reaction, and, were, spurred, to, attempt, to, attract, the, attention, of, the, united, states, government, to, the, issue, towards, this, they, persuaded, albert, einstein, to, lend, his, name, to, a, letter, directed, to, president, franklin, roosevelt, on, 11, october, the, einstein, szil, rd, letter, was, delivered, via, alexander, sachs, roosevelt, quickly, understood, the, implications, stating, alex, what, you, are, after, is, to, see, that, the, nazis, don, t, blow, us, up, roosevelt, ordered, the, formation, of, the, advisory, committee, on, uranium, 303, 309, 312, 317, in, february, 1940, encouraged, by, fermi, and, john, r, dunning, alfred, o, c, nier, was, able, to, separate, u, 235, and, u, 238, from, uranium, tetrachloride, in, a, glass, mass, spectrometer, subsequently, dunning, bombarding, the, u, 235, sample, with, neutrons, generated, by, the, columbia, university, cyclotron, confirmed, u, 235, was, responsible, for, the, slow, neutron, fission, of, uranium, 297, 298, 332, at, the, university, of, birmingham, frisch, teamed, up, with, peierls, who, had, been, working, on, a, critical, mass, formula, assuming, isotope, separation, was, possible, they, considered, 235, u, which, had, a, cross, section, not, yet, determined, but, which, was, assumed, to, be, much, larger, than, that, of, natural, uranium, they, calculated, only, a, pound, or, two, in, a, volume, less, than, a, golf, ball, would, result, in, a, chain, reaction, faster, than, vaporization, and, the, resultant, explosion, would, generate, temperature, greater, than, the, interior, of, the, sun, and, pressures, greater, than, the, center, of, the, earth, additionally, the, costs, of, isotope, separation, would, be, insignificant, compared, to, the, cost, of, the, war, by, march, 1940, encouraged, by, mark, oliphant, they, wrote, the, frisch, peierls, memorandum, in, two, parts, on, the, construction, of, a, super, bomb, based, on, a, nuclear, chain, reaction, in, uranium, and, memorandum, on, the, properties, of, a, radioactive, super, bomb, on, 10, april, 1940, the, first, meeting, of, the, maud, committee, was, held, 321, 325, 330, 331, 340, 341, in, december, 1940, franz, simon, at, oxford, wrote, his, estimate, of, the, size, of, an, actual, separation, plant, simon, proposed, gaseous, diffusion, as, the, best, method, for, uranium, isotope, separation, 339, 343, on, 28, march, 1941, emilio, segr, and, glen, seaborg, reported, on, the, strong, indications, that, 239, pu, undergoes, fission, with, slow, neutrons, this, meant, chemical, separation, was, an, alternative, to, uranium, isotope, separation, instead, a, nuclear, reactor, fueled, with, ordinary, uranium, could, produce, a, plutonium, isotope, as, a, nuclear, explosive, substitute, for, 235, u, in, may, they, demonstrated, the, cross, section, of, plutonium, was, 1, 7, times, that, of, u235, when, plutonium, s, cross, section, for, fast, fission, was, measured, to, be, ten, times, that, of, u238, plutonium, became, a, viable, option, for, a, bomb, 346, 355, 366, 368, in, october, 1941, maud, released, its, final, report, to, the, u, s, government, the, report, stated, we, have, now, reached, the, conclusion, that, it, will, be, possible, to, make, an, effective, uranium, bomb, the, material, for, the, first, bomb, could, be, ready, by, the, end, of, 1943, 368, 369, in, november, 1941, john, dunning, and, eugene, t, booth, were, able, to, demonstrate, the, enrichment, of, uranium, through, gaseous, barrier, diffusion, on, 27, november, bush, delivered, to, third, national, academy, of, sciences, report, to, roosevelt, the, report, amongst, other, things, called, for, parallel, development, of, all, isotope, separation, systems, on, 6, december, bush, and, conant, reorganized, the, uranium, committee, s, tasks, with, harold, urey, developing, gaseous, diffusion, lawrence, developing, electromagnetic, separation, eger, v, murphree, developing, centrifuges, and, arthur, compton, responsible, for, theoretical, studies, and, design, 381, 387, 388, on, 23, april, 1942, met, lab, scientists, discussed, seven, possible, ways, to, extract, plutonium, from, irradiated, uranium, and, decided, to, pursue, investigation, of, all, seven, on, 17, june, the, first, batch, of, uranium, nitrate, hexahydrate, unh, was, undergoing, neutron, bombardment, in, the, washington, university, in, st, louis, cyclotron, on, 27, july, the, irradiated, unh, was, ready, for, glenn, t, seaborg, s, team, on, 20, august, using, ultramicrochemistry, techniques, they, successfully, extracted, plutonium, 408, 415, in, april, 1939, creating, a, chain, reaction, in, natural, uranium, became, the, goal, of, fermi, and, szilard, as, opposed, to, isotope, separation, their, first, efforts, involved, five, hundred, pounds, of, uranium, oxide, from, the, eldorado, radium, corporation, packed, into, fifty, two, cans, two, inches, in, diameter, and, two, feet, long, in, a, tank, of, manganese, solution, they, were, able, to, confirm, more, neutrons, were, emitted, than, absorbed, however, the, hydrogen, within, the, water, absorbed, the, slow, neutrons, necessary, for, fission, carbon, in, the, form, of, graphite, was, then, considered, because, of, its, smaller, capture, cross, section, in, april, 1940, fermi, was, able, to, confirm, carbon, s, potential, for, a, slow, neutron, chain, reaction, after, receiving, national, carbon, company, s, graphite, bricks, at, their, pupin, laboratories, in, august, and, september, the, columbia, team, enlarged, upon, the, cross, section, measurements, by, making, a, series, of, exponential, piles, the, first, piles, consisted, of, a, uranium, graphite, lattice, consisting, of, 288, cans, each, containing, 60, pounds, of, uranium, oxide, surrounded, by, graphite, bricks, fermi, s, goal, was, to, determine, critical, mass, necessary, to, sustain, neutron, generation, fermi, defined, the, reproduction, factor, k, for, assessing, the, chain, reaction, with, a, value, of, 1, 0, denoting, a, sustained, chain, reaction, in, september, 1941, fermi, s, team, was, only, able, to, achieve, a, k, value, of, 0, 87, in, april, 1942, before, the, project, was, centralized, in, chicago, they, had, achieved, 0, 918, by, removing, moisture, from, the, oxide, in, may, 1942, fermi, planned, a, full, scale, chain, reacting, pile, chicago, pile, 1, after, one, of, the, exponential, piles, at, stagg, field, reached, a, k, of, 0, 995, between, 15, september, and, 15, november, herbert, l, anderson, and, walter, zinn, built, sixteen, exponential, piles, acquisition, of, purer, forms, of, graphite, without, traces, of, boron, and, its, large, cross, section, became, paramount, also, important, was, the, acquisition, of, highly, purified, forms, of, oxide, from, mallinckrodt, chemical, works, finally, acquiring, pure, uranium, metal, from, the, ames, process, meant, the, replacement, of, oxide, pseudospheres, with, frank, spedding, s, eggs, starting, on, 16, november, 1942, fermi, had, anderson, and, zinn, working, in, two, twelve, hours, shifts, constructing, a, pile, that, eventually, reached, 57, layers, by, 1, dec, the, final, pile, consisted, of, 771, 000, pounds, of, graphite, 80, 590, pounds, of, uranium, oxide, and, 12, 400, pounds, of, uranium, metal, with, ten, cadmium, control, rods, neutron, intensity, was, measured, with, a, boron, trifluoride, counter, with, the, control, rods, removed, after, the, end, of, each, shift, on, 2, dec, 1942, with, k, approaching, 1, 0, fermi, had, all, but, one, of, the, control, rod, removed, and, gradually, removed, the, last, one, the, neutron, counter, clicks, increased, as, did, the, pen, recorder, when, fermi, announced, the, pile, has, gone, critical, they, had, achieved, a, k, of, 1, 0006, which, meant, neutron, intensity, doubled, every, two, minutes, in, addition, to, breeding, plutonium, 298, 301, 333, 334, 394, 397, 400, 401, 428, 442, in, the, united, states, an, all, out, effort, for, making, atomic, weapons, was, begun, in, late, 1942, this, work, was, taken, over, by, the, u, s, army, corps, of, engineers, in, 1943, and, known, as, the, manhattan, engineer, district, the, top, secret, manhattan, project, as, it, was, colloquially, known, was, led, by, general, leslie, r, groves, among, the, project, s, dozens, of, sites, were, hanford, site, in, washington, which, had, the, first, industrial, scale, nuclear, reactors, and, produced, plutonium, oak, ridge, tennessee, which, was, primarily, concerned, with, uranium, enrichment, and, los, alamos, in, new, mexico, which, was, the, scientific, hub, for, research, on, bomb, development, and, design, other, sites, notably, the, berkeley, radiation, laboratory, and, the, metallurgical, laboratory, at, the, university, of, chicago, played, important, contributing, roles, overall, scientific, direction, of, the, project, was, managed, by, the, physicist, j, robert, oppenheimer, in, july, 1945, the, first, atomic, explosive, device, dubbed, the, gadget, was, detonated, in, the, new, mexico, desert, in, the, trinity, test, it, was, fueled, by, plutonium, created, at, hanford, in, august, 1945, two, more, atomic, devices, little, boy, a, uranium, 235, bomb, and, fat, man, a, plutonium, bomb, were, used, against, the, japanese, cities, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, criticality, in, nature, is, uncommon, at, three, ore, deposits, at, oklo, in, gabon, sixteen, sites, the, so, called, oklo, fossil, reactors, have, been, discovered, at, which, self, sustaining, nuclear, fission, took, place, approximately, 2, billion, years, ago, french, physicist, francis, perrin, discovered, the, oklo, fossil, reactors, in, 1972, but, it, was, postulated, by, paul, kuroda, in, 1956, large, scale, natural, uranium, fission, chain, reactions, moderated, by, normal, water, had, occurred, far, in, the, past, and, would, not, be, possible, now, this, ancient, process, was, able, to, use, normal, water, as, a, moderator, only, because, 2, billion, years, before, the, present, natural, uranium, was, richer, in, the, shorter, lived, fissile, isotope, 235, u, about, 3, than, natural, uranium, available, today, which, is, only, 0, 7, and, must, be, enriched, to, 3, to, be, usable, in, light, water, reactors
