cirrus, cloud, classification, symbol, ci, is, a, genus, of, high, cloud, made, of, ice, crystals, cirrus, clouds, typically, appear, delicate, and, wispy, with, white, strands, cirrus, are, usually, formed, when, warm, dry, air, rises, causing, water, vapor, deposition, onto, rocky, or, metallic, dust, particles, at, high, altitudes, globally, they, form, anywhere, between, 4, 000, and, 20, 000, meters, 13, 000, and, 66, 000, feet, above, sea, level, with, the, higher, elevations, usually, in, the, tropics, and, the, lower, elevations, in, more, polar, regions, cirrus, clouds, can, form, from, the, tops, of, thunderstorms, and, tropical, cyclones, and, sometimes, predict, the, arrival, of, rain, or, storms, although, they, are, a, sign, that, rain, and, maybe, storms, are, on, the, way, cirrus, themselves, drop, no, more, than, falling, streaks, of, ice, crystals, these, crystals, dissipate, melt, and, evaporate, as, they, fall, through, warmer, and, drier, air, and, never, reach, ground, cirrus, clouds, warm, the, earth, potentially, contributing, to, climate, change, a, warming, earth, will, likely, produce, more, cirrus, clouds, potentially, resulting, in, a, self, reinforcing, loop, optical, phenomena, such, as, sun, dogs, and, halos, can, be, produced, by, light, interacting, with, ice, crystals, in, cirrus, clouds, there, are, two, other, high, level, cirrus, like, clouds, called, cirrostratus, and, cirrocumulus, cirrostratus, looks, like, a, sheet, of, cloud, whereas, cirrocumulus, looks, like, a, pattern, of, small, cloud, tufts, unlike, cirrus, and, cirrostratus, cirrocumulus, clouds, contain, droplets, of, supercooled, below, freezing, point, water, cirrus, clouds, form, in, the, atmospheres, of, mars, jupiter, saturn, uranus, and, neptune, and, on, titan, one, of, saturn, s, larger, moons, some, of, these, extraterrestrial, cirrus, clouds, are, made, of, ammonia, or, methane, ice, much, like, water, ice, in, cirrus, on, earth, some, interstellar, clouds, made, of, grains, of, dust, smaller, than, a, thousandth, of, a, millimeter, are, also, called, cirrus, cirrus, are, wispy, clouds, made, of, long, strands, of, ice, crystals, that, are, described, as, feathery, hair, like, or, layered, in, appearance, first, defined, scientifically, by, luke, howard, in, an, 1803, paper, their, name, is, derived, from, the, latin, word, cirrus, meaning, curl, or, fringe, they, are, transparent, meaning, that, the, sun, can, be, seen, through, them, ice, crystals, in, the, clouds, cause, them, to, usually, appear, white, but, the, rising, or, setting, sun, can, color, them, various, shades, of, yellow, or, red, at, dusk, they, can, appear, gray, cirrus, comes, in, five, visually, distinct, species, castellanus, fibratus, floccus, spissatus, and, uncinus, each, species, is, divided, into, up, to, four, varieties, intortus, vertebratus, radiatus, and, duplicatus, cirrus, clouds, often, produce, hair, like, filaments, called, fall, streaks, made, of, heavier, ice, crystals, that, fall, from, the, cloud, these, are, similar, to, the, virga, produced, in, liquid, water, clouds, the, sizes, and, shapes, of, fall, streaks, are, determined, by, the, wind, shear, cirrus, cloud, cover, varies, diurnally, during, the, day, cirrus, cloud, cover, drops, and, during, the, night, it, increases, based, on, calipso, satellite, data, cirrus, covers, an, average, of, 31, to, 32, of, the, earth, s, surface, cirrus, cloud, cover, varies, wildly, by, location, with, some, parts, of, the, tropics, reaching, up, to, 70, cirrus, cloud, cover, polar, regions, on, the, other, hand, have, significantly, less, cirrus, cloud, cover, with, some, areas, having, a, yearly, average, of, only, around, 10, coverage, these, percentages, treat, clear, days, and, nights, as, well, as, days, and, nights, with, other, cloud, types, as, lack, of, cirrus, cloud, cover, cirrus, clouds, are, usually, formed, as, warm, dry, air, rises, causing, water, vapor, to, undergo, deposition, onto, rocky, or, metallic, dust, particles, at, high, altitudes, the, average, cirrus, cloud, altitude, increases, as, latitude, decreases, but, the, altitude, is, always, capped, by, the, tropopause, these, conditions, commonly, occur, at, the, leading, edge, of, a, warm, front, because, absolute, humidity, is, low, at, such, high, altitudes, this, genus, tends, to, be, fairly, transparent, cirrus, clouds, can, also, form, inside, fallstreak, holes, also, called, cavum, at, latitudes, of, 65, n, or, s, close, to, polar, regions, cirrus, clouds, form, on, average, only, 7, 000, m, 23, 000, ft, above, sea, level, in, temperate, regions, at, roughly, 45, n, or, s, their, average, altitude, increases, to, 9, 500, m, 31, 200, ft, above, sea, level, in, tropical, regions, at, roughly, 5, n, or, s, cirrus, clouds, form, 13, 500, m, 44, 300, ft, above, sea, level, on, average, across, the, globe, cirrus, clouds, can, form, anywhere, from, 4, 000, to, 20, 000, m, 13, 000, to, 66, 000, ft, above, sea, level, cirrus, clouds, form, with, a, vast, range, of, thicknesses, they, can, be, as, little, as, 100, m, 330, ft, from, top, to, bottom, to, as, thick, as, 8, 000, m, 26, 000, ft, cirrus, cloud, thickness, is, usually, somewhere, between, those, two, extremes, with, an, average, thickness, of, 1, 500, m, 4, 900, ft, the, jet, stream, a, high, level, wind, band, can, stretch, cirrus, clouds, long, enough, to, cross, continents, jet, streaks, bands, of, faster, moving, air, in, the, jet, stream, can, create, arcs, of, cirrus, cloud, hundreds, of, kilometers, long, cirrus, cloud, formation, may, be, effected, by, organic, aerosols, particles, produced, by, plants, acting, as, additional, nucleation, points, for, ice, crystal, formation, however, research, suggests, that, cirrus, clouds, more, commonly, form, on, rocky, or, metallic, particles, rather, than, on, organic, ones, sheets, of, cirrus, clouds, commonly, fan, out, from, the, eye, walls, of, tropical, cyclones, the, eye, wall, is, the, ring, of, storm, clouds, surrounding, the, eye, of, a, tropical, cyclone, a, large, shield, of, cirrus, and, cirrostratus, typically, accompanies, the, high, altitude, outflowing, winds, of, tropical, cyclones, and, these, can, make, the, underlying, bands, of, rain, and, sometimes, even, the, eye, difficult, to, detect, in, satellite, photographs, thunderstorms, can, form, dense, cirrus, at, their, tops, as, the, cumulonimbus, cloud, in, a, thunderstorm, grows, vertically, the, liquid, water, droplets, freeze, when, the, air, temperature, reaches, the, freezing, point, the, anvil, cloud, takes, its, shape, because, the, temperature, inversion, at, the, tropopause, prevents, the, warm, moist, air, forming, the, thunderstorm, from, rising, any, higher, thus, creating, the, flat, top, in, the, tropics, these, thunderstorms, occasionally, produce, copious, amounts, of, cirrus, from, their, anvils, high, altitude, winds, commonly, push, this, dense, mat, out, into, an, anvil, shape, that, stretches, downwind, as, much, as, several, kilometers, individual, cirrus, cloud, formations, can, be, the, remnants, of, anvil, clouds, formed, by, thunderstorms, in, the, dissipating, stage, of, a, cumulonimbus, cloud, when, the, normal, column, rising, up, to, the, anvil, has, evaporated, or, dissipated, the, mat, of, cirrus, in, the, anvil, is, all, that, is, left, contrails, are, an, artificial, type, of, cirrus, cloud, formed, when, water, vapor, from, the, exhaust, of, a, jet, engine, condenses, on, particles, which, come, from, either, the, surrounding, air, or, the, exhaust, itself, and, freezes, leaving, behind, a, visible, trail, the, exhaust, can, trigger, the, formation, of, cirrus, by, providing, ice, nuclei, when, there, is, an, insufficient, naturally, occurring, supply, in, the, atmosphere, one, of, the, environmental, impacts, of, aviation, is, that, persistent, contrails, can, form, into, large, mats, of, cirrus, and, increased, air, traffic, has, been, implicated, as, one, possible, cause, of, the, increasing, frequency, and, amount, of, cirrus, in, earth, s, atmosphere, random, isolated, cirrus, do, not, have, any, particular, significance, a, large, number, of, cirrus, clouds, can, be, a, sign, of, an, approaching, frontal, system, or, upper, air, disturbance, the, appearance, of, cirrus, signals, a, change, in, weather, usually, more, stormy, in, the, near, future, if, the, cloud, is, a, cirrus, castellanus, there, might, be, instability, at, the, high, altitude, level, when, the, clouds, deepen, and, spread, especially, when, they, are, of, the, cirrus, radiatus, variety, or, cirrus, fibratus, species, this, usually, indicates, an, approaching, weather, front, if, it, is, a, warm, front, the, cirrus, clouds, spread, out, into, cirrostratus, which, then, thicken, and, lower, into, altocumulus, and, altostratus, the, next, set, of, clouds, are, the, rain, bearing, nimbostratus, clouds, when, cirrus, clouds, precede, a, cold, front, squall, line, or, multicellular, thunderstorm, it, is, because, they, are, blown, off, the, anvil, and, the, next, clouds, to, arrive, are, the, cumulonimbus, clouds, kelvin, helmholtz, waves, indicate, extreme, wind, shear, at, high, levels, when, a, jet, streak, creates, a, large, arc, of, cirrus, weather, conditions, may, be, right, for, the, development, of, winter, storms, within, the, tropics, 36, hours, prior, to, the, center, passage, of, a, tropical, cyclone, a, veil, of, white, cirrus, clouds, approaches, from, the, direction, of, the, cyclone, in, the, mid, to, late, 19th, century, forecasters, used, these, cirrus, veils, to, predict, the, arrival, of, hurricanes, in, the, early, 1870s, the, president, of, bel, n, college, in, havana, father, benito, vi, es, developed, the, first, hurricane, forecasting, system, he, mainly, used, the, motion, of, these, clouds, in, formulating, his, predictions, he, would, observe, the, clouds, hourly, from, 4, 00, am, to, 10, 00, pm, after, accumulating, enough, information, vi, es, began, accurately, predicting, the, paths, of, hurricanes, he, summarized, his, observations, in, his, book, apuntes, relativos, a, los, huracanes, de, las, antilles, published, in, english, as, practical, hints, in, regard, to, west, indian, hurricanes, cirrus, clouds, cover, up, to, 25, of, the, earth, up, to, 70, in, the, tropics, at, night, and, have, a, net, heating, effect, when, they, are, thin, and, translucent, the, clouds, efficiently, absorb, outgoing, infrared, radiation, while, only, marginally, reflecting, the, incoming, sunlight, when, cirrus, clouds, are, 100, m, 330, ft, thick, they, reflect, only, around, 9, of, the, incoming, sunlight, but, they, prevent, almost, 50, of, the, outgoing, infrared, radiation, from, escaping, thus, raising, the, temperature, of, the, atmosphere, beneath, the, clouds, by, an, average, of, 10, c, 18, f, a, process, known, as, the, greenhouse, effect, averaged, worldwide, cloud, formation, results, in, a, temperature, loss, of, 5, c, 9, f, at, the, earth, s, surface, mainly, the, result, of, stratocumulus, clouds, cirrus, clouds, are, likely, becoming, more, common, due, to, climate, change, as, their, greenhouse, effect, is, stronger, than, their, reflection, of, sunlight, this, would, act, as, a, self, reinforcing, feedback, metallic, particles, from, human, sources, act, as, additional, nucleation, seeds, potentially, increasing, cirrus, cloud, cover, and, thus, contributing, further, to, climate, change, aircraft, in, the, upper, troposphere, can, create, contrail, cirrus, clouds, if, local, weather, conditions, are, right, these, contrails, contribute, to, climate, change, cirrus, cloud, thinning, has, been, proposed, as, a, possible, geoengineering, approach, to, reduce, climate, damage, due, to, carbon, dioxide, cirrus, cloud, thinning, would, involve, injecting, particles, into, the, upper, troposphere, to, reduce, the, amount, of, cirrus, clouds, the, 2021, ipcc, assessment, report, expressed, low, confidence, in, the, cooling, effect, of, cirrus, cloud, thinning, due, to, limited, understanding, scientists, have, studied, the, properties, of, cirrus, using, several, different, methods, lidar, laser, based, radar, gives, highly, accurate, information, on, the, cloud, s, altitude, length, and, width, balloon, carried, hygrometers, measure, the, humidity, of, the, cirrus, cloud, but, are, not, accurate, enough, to, measure, the, depth, of, the, cloud, radar, units, give, information, on, the, altitudes, and, thicknesses, of, cirrus, clouds, another, data, source, is, satellite, measurements, from, the, stratospheric, aerosol, and, gas, experiment, program, these, satellites, measure, where, infrared, radiation, is, absorbed, in, the, atmosphere, and, if, it, is, absorbed, at, cirrus, altitudes, then, it, is, assumed, that, there, are, cirrus, clouds, in, that, location, nasa, s, moderate, resolution, imaging, spectroradiometer, gives, information, on, the, cirrus, cloud, cover, by, measuring, reflected, infrared, radiation, of, various, specific, frequencies, during, the, day, during, the, night, it, determines, cirrus, cover, by, detecting, the, earth, s, infrared, emissions, the, cloud, reflects, this, radiation, back, to, the, ground, thus, enabling, satellites, to, see, the, shadow, it, casts, into, space, visual, observations, from, aircraft, or, the, ground, provide, additional, information, about, cirrus, clouds, particle, analysis, by, laser, mass, spectrometry, palms, is, used, to, identify, the, type, of, nucleation, seeds, that, spawned, the, ice, crystals, in, a, cirrus, cloud, cirrus, clouds, have, an, average, ice, crystal, concentration, of, 300, 000, ice, crystals, per, 10, cubic, meters, 270, 000, ice, crystals, per, 10, cubic, yards, the, concentration, ranges, from, as, low, as, 1, ice, crystal, per, 10, cubic, meters, to, as, high, as, 100, million, ice, crystals, per, 10, cubic, meters, just, under, 1, ice, crystal, per, 10, cubic, yards, to, 77, million, ice, crystals, per, 10, cubic, yards, a, difference, of, eight, orders, of, magnitude, the, size, of, each, ice, crystal, is, typically, 0, 25, millimeters, but, they, range, from, as, short, as, 0, 01, millimeters, up, to, several, millimeters, the, ice, crystals, in, contrails, can, be, much, smaller, than, those, in, naturally, occurring, cirrus, cloud, being, around, 0, 001, millimeters, to, 0, 1, millimeters, in, length, in, addition, to, forming, in, different, sizes, the, ice, crystals, in, cirrus, clouds, can, crystallize, in, different, shapes, solid, columns, hollow, columns, plates, rosettes, and, conglomerations, of, the, various, other, types, the, shape, of, the, ice, crystals, is, determined, by, the, air, temperature, atmospheric, pressure, and, ice, supersaturation, the, amount, by, which, the, relative, humidity, exceeds, 100, cirrus, in, temperate, regions, typically, have, the, various, ice, crystal, shapes, separated, by, type, the, columns, and, plates, concentrate, near, the, top, of, the, cloud, whereas, the, rosettes, and, conglomerations, concentrate, near, the, base, in, the, northern, arctic, region, cirrus, clouds, tend, to, be, composed, of, only, the, columns, plates, and, conglomerations, and, these, crystals, tend, to, be, at, least, four, times, larger, than, the, minimum, size, in, antarctica, cirrus, are, usually, composed, of, only, columns, which, are, much, longer, than, normal, cirrus, clouds, are, usually, colder, than, 20, c, 4, f, at, temperatures, above, 68, c, 90, f, most, cirrus, clouds, have, relative, humidities, of, roughly, 100, that, is, they, are, saturated, cirrus, can, supersaturate, with, relative, humidities, over, ice, that, can, exceed, 200, below, 68, c, 90, f, there, are, more, of, both, undersaturated, and, supersaturated, cirrus, clouds, the, more, supersaturated, clouds, are, probably, young, cirrus, cirrus, clouds, can, produce, several, optical, effects, like, halos, around, the, sun, and, moon, halos, are, caused, by, interaction, of, the, light, with, hexagonal, ice, crystals, present, in, the, clouds, which, depending, on, their, shape, and, orientation, can, result, in, a, wide, variety, of, white, and, colored, rings, arcs, and, spots, in, the, sky, including, sun, dogs, the, 46, halo, the, 22, halo, and, circumhorizontal, arcs, circumhorizontal, arcs, are, only, visible, when, the, sun, rises, higher, than, 58, above, the, horizon, preventing, observers, at, higher, latitudes, from, ever, being, able, to, see, them, more, rarely, cirrus, clouds, are, capable, of, producing, glories, more, commonly, associated, with, liquid, water, based, clouds, such, as, stratus, a, glory, is, a, set, of, concentric, faintly, colored, glowing, rings, that, appear, around, the, shadow, of, the, observer, and, are, best, observed, from, a, high, viewpoint, or, from, a, plane, cirrus, clouds, only, form, glories, when, the, constituent, ice, crystals, are, aspherical, researchers, suggest, that, the, ice, crystals, must, be, between, 0, 009, millimeters, and, 0, 015, millimeters, in, length, for, a, glory, to, appear, cirrus, clouds, are, one, of, three, different, genera, of, high, level, clouds, all, of, which, are, given, the, prefix, cirro, the, other, two, genera, are, cirrocumulus, and, cirrostratus, high, level, clouds, usually, form, above, 6, 100, m, 20, 000, ft, cirrocumulus, and, cirrostratus, are, sometimes, informally, referred, to, as, cirriform, clouds, because, of, their, frequent, association, with, cirrus, in, the, intermediate, range, from, 2, 000, to, 6, 100, m, 6, 500, to, 20, 000, ft, are, the, mid, level, clouds, which, are, given, the, prefix, alto, they, comprise, two, genera, altostratus, and, altocumulus, these, clouds, are, formed, from, ice, crystals, supercooled, water, droplets, or, liquid, water, droplets, low, level, clouds, usually, form, below, 2, 000, m, 6, 500, ft, and, do, not, have, a, prefix, the, two, genera, that, are, strictly, low, level, are, stratus, and, stratocumulus, these, clouds, are, composed, of, water, droplets, except, during, winter, when, they, are, formed, of, supercooled, water, droplets, or, ice, crystals, if, the, temperature, at, cloud, level, is, below, freezing, three, additional, genera, usually, form, in, the, low, altitude, range, but, may, be, based, at, higher, levels, under, conditions, of, very, low, humidity, they, are, the, genera, cumulus, and, cumulonimbus, and, nimbostratus, these, are, sometimes, classified, separately, as, clouds, of, vertical, development, especially, when, their, tops, are, high, enough, to, be, composed, of, supercooled, water, droplets, or, ice, crystals, cirrocumulus, clouds, form, in, sheets, or, patches, and, do, not, cast, shadows, they, commonly, appear, in, regular, rippling, patterns, or, in, rows, of, clouds, with, clear, areas, between, cirrocumulus, are, like, other, members, of, the, cumuliform, category, formed, via, convective, processes, significant, growth, of, these, patches, indicates, high, altitude, instability, and, can, signal, the, approach, of, poorer, weather, the, ice, crystals, in, the, bottoms, of, cirrocumulus, clouds, tend, to, be, in, the, form, of, hexagonal, cylinders, they, are, not, solid, but, instead, tend, to, have, stepped, funnels, coming, in, from, the, ends, towards, the, top, of, the, cloud, these, crystals, have, a, tendency, to, clump, together, these, clouds, do, not, last, long, and, they, tend, to, change, into, cirrus, because, as, the, water, vapor, continues, to, deposit, on, the, ice, crystals, they, eventually, begin, to, fall, destroying, the, upward, convection, the, cloud, then, dissipates, into, cirrus, cirrocumulus, clouds, come, in, four, species, stratiformis, lenticularis, castellanus, and, floccus, they, are, iridescent, when, the, constituent, supercooled, water, droplets, are, all, about, the, same, size, cirrostratus, clouds, can, appear, as, a, milky, sheen, in, the, sky, or, as, a, striated, sheet, they, are, sometimes, similar, to, altostratus, and, are, distinguishable, from, the, latter, because, the, sun, or, moon, is, always, clearly, visible, through, transparent, cirrostratus, in, contrast, to, altostratus, which, tends, to, be, opaque, or, translucent, cirrostratus, come, in, two, species, fibratus, and, nebulosus, the, ice, crystals, in, these, clouds, vary, depending, upon, the, height, in, the, cloud, towards, the, bottom, at, temperatures, of, around, 35, to, 45, c, 31, to, 49, f, the, crystals, tend, to, be, long, solid, hexagonal, columns, towards, the, top, of, the, cloud, at, temperatures, of, around, 47, to, 52, c, 53, to, 62, f, the, predominant, crystal, types, are, thick, hexagonal, plates, and, short, solid, hexagonal, columns, these, clouds, commonly, produce, halos, and, sometimes, the, halo, is, the, only, indication, that, such, clouds, are, present, they, are, formed, by, warm, moist, air, being, lifted, slowly, to, a, very, high, altitude, when, a, warm, front, approaches, cirrostratus, clouds, become, thicker, and, descend, forming, altostratus, clouds, and, rain, usually, begins, 12, to, 24, hours, later, cirrus, clouds, have, been, observed, on, several, other, planets, in, 2008, the, martian, lander, phoenix, took, a, time, lapse, photograph, of, a, group, of, cirrus, clouds, moving, across, the, martian, sky, using, lidar, near, the, end, of, its, mission, the, phoenix, lander, detected, more, thin, clouds, close, to, the, north, pole, of, mars, over, the, course, of, several, days, they, thickened, lowered, and, eventually, began, snowing, the, total, precipitation, was, only, a, few, thousandths, of, a, millimeter, james, whiteway, from, york, university, concluded, that, precipitation, is, a, component, of, the, hydrologic, cycle, these, clouds, formed, during, the, martian, night, in, two, layers, one, around, 4, 000, m, 13, 000, ft, above, ground, and, the, other, at, surface, level, they, lasted, through, early, morning, before, being, burned, away, by, the, sun, the, crystals, in, these, clouds, were, formed, at, a, temperature, of, 65, c, 85, f, and, they, were, shaped, roughly, like, ellipsoids, 0, 127, millimeters, long, and, 0, 042, millimeters, wide, on, jupiter, cirrus, clouds, are, composed, of, ammonia, when, jupiter, s, south, equatorial, belt, disappeared, one, hypothesis, put, forward, by, glenn, orten, was, that, a, large, quantity, of, ammonia, cirrus, clouds, had, formed, above, it, hiding, it, from, view, nasa, s, cassini, probe, detected, these, clouds, on, saturn, and, thin, water, ice, cirrus, on, saturn, s, moon, titan, cirrus, clouds, composed, of, methane, ice, exist, on, uranus, on, neptune, thin, wispy, clouds, which, could, possibly, be, cirrus, have, been, detected, over, the, great, dark, spot, as, on, uranus, these, are, probably, methane, crystals, interstellar, cirrus, clouds, are, composed, of, tiny, dust, grains, smaller, than, a, micrometer, and, are, therefore, not, true, cirrus, clouds, which, are, composed, of, frozen, crystals, they, range, from, a, few, light, years, to, dozens, of, light, years, across, while, they, are, not, technically, cirrus, clouds, the, dust, clouds, are, referred, to, as, cirrus, because, of, their, similarity, to, the, clouds, on, earth, they, emit, infrared, radiation, similar, to, the, way, cirrus, clouds, on, earth, reflect, heat, being, radiated, out, into, space, footnotes, bibliography
