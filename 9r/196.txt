a, dark, nebula, or, absorption, nebula, is, a, type, of, interstellar, cloud, particularly, molecular, clouds, that, is, so, dense, that, it, obscures, the, visible, wavelengths, of, light, from, objects, behind, it, such, as, background, stars, and, emission, or, reflection, nebulae, the, extinction, of, the, light, is, caused, by, interstellar, dust, grains, in, the, coldest, densest, parts, of, molecular, clouds, clusters, and, large, complexes, of, dark, nebulae, are, associated, with, giant, molecular, clouds, isolated, small, dark, nebulae, are, called, bok, globules, like, other, interstellar, dust, or, material, the, things, it, obscures, are, visible, only, using, radio, waves, in, radio, astronomy, or, infrared, in, infrared, astronomy, dark, clouds, appear, so, because, of, sub, micrometre, sized, dust, particles, coated, with, frozen, carbon, monoxide, and, nitrogen, which, effectively, block, the, passage, of, light, at, visible, wavelengths, also, present, are, molecular, hydrogen, atomic, helium, c, 18, o, co, with, oxygen, as, the, 18, o, isotope, cs, nh, 3, ammonia, h, 2, co, formaldehyde, c, c, 3, h, 2, cyclopropenylidene, and, a, molecular, ion, n, 2, h, diazenylium, all, of, which, are, relatively, transparent, these, clouds, are, the, spawning, grounds, of, stars, and, planets, and, understanding, their, development, is, essential, to, understanding, star, formation, the, form, of, such, dark, clouds, is, very, irregular, they, have, no, clearly, defined, outer, boundaries, and, sometimes, take, on, convoluted, serpentine, shapes, the, closest, and, largest, dark, nebulae, are, visible, to, the, naked, eye, since, they, are, the, least, obscured, by, stars, in, between, earth, and, the, nebula, and, because, they, have, the, largest, angular, size, appearing, as, dark, patches, against, the, brighter, background, of, the, milky, way, like, the, coalsack, nebula, and, the, great, rift, these, naked, eye, objects, are, sometimes, known, as, dark, cloud, constellations, and, take, on, a, variety, of, names, in, the, inner, molecular, regions, of, dark, nebulae, important, events, take, place, such, as, the, formation, of, stars, and, masers, along, with, molecular, clouds, dark, nebula, make, up, molecular, cloud, complexes, dark, nebula, form, in, the, night, sky, apparent, dark, cloud, constellations
