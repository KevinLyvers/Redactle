recognition, status, as, metalloids, of, some, elements, in, the, p, block, of, the, periodic, table, percentages, are, median, appearance, frequencies, in, the, lists, of, metalloids, the, staircase, shaped, line, is, a, typical, example, of, the, arbitrary, metal, nonmetal, dividing, line, found, on, some, periodic, tables, a, metalloid, is, a, chemical, element, which, has, a, preponderance, of, properties, in, between, or, that, are, a, mixture, of, those, of, metals, and, nonmetals, the, word, metalloid, comes, from, the, latin, metallum, metal, and, the, greek, oeides, resembling, in, form, or, appearance, there, is, no, standard, definition, of, a, metalloid, and, no, complete, agreement, on, which, elements, are, metalloids, despite, the, lack, of, specificity, the, term, remains, in, use, in, the, literature, the, six, commonly, recognised, metalloids, are, boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and, tellurium, five, elements, are, less, frequently, so, classified, carbon, aluminium, selenium, polonium, and, astatine, on, a, standard, periodic, table, all, eleven, elements, are, in, a, diagonal, region, of, the, p, block, extending, from, boron, at, the, upper, left, to, astatine, at, lower, right, some, periodic, tables, include, a, dividing, line, between, metals, and, nonmetals, and, the, metalloids, may, be, found, close, to, this, line, typical, metalloids, have, a, metallic, appearance, may, be, brittle, and, are, only, fair, conductors, of, electricity, they, can, form, alloys, with, metals, and, many, of, their, other, physical, properties, and, chemical, properties, are, intermediate, between, those, of, metallic, and, nonmetallic, elements, they, and, their, compounds, are, used, in, alloys, biological, agents, catalysts, flame, retardants, glasses, optical, storage, and, optoelectronics, pyrotechnics, semiconductors, and, electronics, the, term, metalloid, originally, referred, to, nonmetals, its, more, recent, meaning, as, a, category, of, elements, with, intermediate, or, hybrid, properties, became, widespread, in, 1940, 1960, metalloids, are, sometimes, called, semimetals, a, practice, that, has, been, discouraged, as, the, term, semimetal, has, a, more, common, usage, as, a, specific, kind, of, electronic, band, structure, of, a, substance, in, this, context, only, arsenic, and, antimony, are, semimetals, and, commonly, recognised, as, metalloids, a, metalloid, is, an, element, that, possesses, a, preponderance, of, properties, in, between, or, that, are, a, mixture, of, those, of, metals, and, nonmetals, and, which, is, therefore, hard, to, classify, as, either, a, metal, or, a, nonmetal, this, is, a, generic, definition, that, draws, on, metalloid, attributes, consistently, cited, in, the, literature, difficulty, of, categorisation, is, a, key, attribute, most, elements, have, a, mixture, of, metallic, and, nonmetallic, properties, and, can, be, classified, according, to, which, set, of, properties, is, more, pronounced, only, the, elements, at, or, near, the, margins, lacking, a, sufficiently, clear, preponderance, of, either, metallic, or, nonmetallic, properties, are, classified, as, metalloids, boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and, tellurium, are, commonly, recognised, as, metalloids, depending, on, the, author, one, or, more, from, selenium, polonium, or, astatine, are, sometimes, added, to, the, list, boron, sometimes, is, excluded, by, itself, or, with, silicon, sometimes, tellurium, is, not, regarded, as, a, metalloid, the, inclusion, of, antimony, polonium, and, astatine, as, metalloids, has, been, questioned, other, elements, are, occasionally, classified, as, metalloids, these, elements, include, hydrogen, beryllium, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, zinc, gallium, tin, iodine, lead, bismuth, and, radon, the, term, metalloid, has, also, been, used, for, elements, that, exhibit, metallic, lustre, and, electrical, conductivity, and, that, are, amphoteric, such, as, arsenic, antimony, vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, tin, lead, and, aluminium, the, p, block, metals, and, nonmetals, such, as, carbon, or, nitrogen, that, can, form, alloys, with, metals, or, modify, their, properties, have, also, occasionally, been, considered, as, metalloids, no, widely, accepted, definition, of, a, metalloid, exists, nor, any, division, of, the, periodic, table, into, metals, metalloids, and, nonmetals, hawkes, questioned, the, feasibility, of, establishing, a, specific, definition, noting, that, anomalies, can, be, found, in, several, attempted, constructs, classifying, an, element, as, a, metalloid, has, been, described, by, sharp, as, arbitrary, the, number, and, identities, of, metalloids, depend, on, what, classification, criteria, are, used, emsley, recognised, four, metalloids, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and, tellurium, james, et, al, listed, twelve, emsley, s, plus, boron, carbon, silicon, selenium, bismuth, polonium, moscovium, and, livermorium, on, average, seven, elements, are, included, in, such, lists, individual, classification, arrangements, tend, to, share, common, ground, and, vary, in, the, ill, defined, margins, a, single, quantitative, criterion, such, as, electronegativity, is, commonly, used, metalloids, having, electronegativity, values, from, 1, 8, or, 1, 9, to, 2, 2, further, examples, include, packing, efficiency, the, fraction, of, volume, in, a, crystal, structure, occupied, by, atoms, and, the, goldhammer, herzfeld, criterion, ratio, the, commonly, recognised, metalloids, have, packing, efficiencies, of, between, 34, and, 41, the, goldhammer, herzfeld, ratio, roughly, equal, to, the, cube, of, the, atomic, radius, divided, by, the, molar, volume, is, a, simple, measure, of, how, metallic, an, element, is, the, recognised, metalloids, having, ratios, from, around, 0, 85, to, 1, 1, and, averaging, 1, 0, other, authors, have, relied, on, for, example, atomic, conductance, or, bulk, coordination, number, jones, writing, on, the, role, of, classification, in, science, observed, that, are, usually, defined, by, more, than, two, attributes, masterton, and, slowinski, used, three, criteria, to, describe, the, six, elements, commonly, recognised, as, metalloids, metalloids, have, ionization, energies, around, 200, kcal, mol, 837, kj, mol, and, electronegativity, values, close, to, 2, 0, they, also, said, that, metalloids, are, typically, semiconductors, though, antimony, and, arsenic, semimetals, from, a, physics, perspective, have, electrical, conductivities, approaching, those, of, metals, selenium, and, polonium, are, suspected, as, not, in, this, scheme, while, astatine, s, status, is, uncertain, in, this, context, vernon, proposed, that, a, metalloid, is, a, chemical, element, that, in, its, standard, state, has, a, the, electronic, band, structure, of, a, semiconductor, or, a, semimetal, and, b, an, intermediate, first, ionization, potential, say, 750, 1, 000, kj, mol, and, c, an, intermediate, electronegativity, 1, 9, 2, 2, periodic, table, extract, showing, groups, 1, 2, and, 12, 18, and, a, dividing, line, between, metals, and, nonmetals, percentages, are, median, appearance, frequencies, in, the, list, of, metalloid, lists, sporadically, recognised, elements, show, that, the, metalloid, net, is, sometimes, cast, very, widely, although, they, do, not, appear, in, the, list, of, metalloid, lists, isolated, references, to, their, designation, as, metalloids, can, be, found, in, the, literature, as, cited, in, this, article, metalloids, lie, on, either, side, of, the, dividing, line, between, metals, and, nonmetals, this, can, be, found, in, varying, configurations, on, some, periodic, tables, elements, to, the, lower, left, of, the, line, generally, display, increasing, metallic, behaviour, elements, to, the, upper, right, display, increasing, nonmetallic, behaviour, when, presented, as, a, regular, stairstep, elements, with, the, highest, critical, temperature, for, their, groups, li, be, al, ge, sb, po, lie, just, below, the, line, the, diagonal, positioning, of, the, metalloids, represents, an, exception, to, the, observation, that, elements, with, similar, properties, tend, to, occur, in, vertical, groups, a, related, effect, can, be, seen, in, other, diagonal, similarities, between, some, elements, and, their, lower, right, neighbours, specifically, lithium, magnesium, beryllium, aluminium, and, boron, silicon, rayner, canham, has, argued, that, these, similarities, extend, to, carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen, sulfur, and, into, three, d, block, series, this, exception, arises, due, to, competing, horizontal, and, vertical, trends, in, the, nuclear, charge, going, along, a, period, the, nuclear, charge, increases, with, atomic, number, as, do, the, number, of, electrons, the, additional, pull, on, outer, electrons, as, nuclear, charge, increases, generally, outweighs, the, screening, effect, of, having, more, electrons, with, some, irregularities, atoms, therefore, become, smaller, ionization, energy, increases, and, there, is, a, gradual, change, in, character, across, a, period, from, strongly, metallic, to, weakly, metallic, to, weakly, nonmetallic, to, strongly, nonmetallic, elements, going, down, a, main, group, the, effect, of, increasing, nuclear, charge, is, generally, outweighed, by, the, effect, of, additional, electrons, being, further, away, from, the, nucleus, atoms, generally, become, larger, ionization, energy, falls, and, metallic, character, increases, the, net, effect, is, that, the, location, of, the, metal, nonmetal, transition, zone, shifts, to, the, right, in, going, down, a, group, and, analogous, diagonal, similarities, are, seen, elsewhere, in, the, periodic, table, as, noted, elements, bordering, the, metal, nonmetal, dividing, line, are, not, always, classified, as, metalloids, noting, a, binary, classification, can, facilitate, the, establishment, of, rules, for, determining, bond, types, between, metals, and, nonmetals, in, such, cases, the, authors, concerned, focus, on, one, or, more, attributes, of, interest, to, make, their, classification, decisions, rather, than, being, concerned, about, the, marginal, nature, of, the, elements, in, question, their, considerations, may, or, not, be, made, explicit, and, may, at, times, seem, arbitrary, metalloids, may, be, grouped, with, metals, or, regarded, as, nonmetals, or, treated, as, a, sub, category, of, nonmetals, other, authors, have, suggested, classifying, some, elements, as, metalloids, emphasizes, that, properties, change, gradually, rather, than, abruptly, as, one, moves, across, or, down, the, periodic, table, some, periodic, tables, distinguish, elements, that, are, metalloids, and, display, no, formal, dividing, line, between, metals, and, nonmetals, metalloids, are, instead, shown, as, occurring, in, a, diagonal, band, or, diffuse, region, the, key, consideration, is, to, explain, the, context, for, the, taxonomy, in, use, metalloids, usually, look, like, metals, but, behave, largely, like, nonmetals, physically, they, are, shiny, brittle, solids, with, intermediate, to, relatively, good, electrical, conductivity, and, the, electronic, band, structure, of, a, semimetal, or, semiconductor, chemically, they, mostly, behave, as, weak, nonmetals, have, intermediate, ionization, energies, and, electronegativity, values, and, amphoteric, or, weakly, acidic, oxides, most, of, their, other, physical, and, chemical, properties, are, intermediate, in, nature, characteristic, properties, of, metals, metalloids, and, nonmetals, are, summarized, in, the, table, physical, properties, are, listed, in, order, of, ease, of, determination, chemical, properties, run, from, general, to, specific, and, then, to, descriptive, the, above, table, reflects, the, hybrid, nature, of, metalloids, the, properties, of, form, appearance, and, behaviour, when, mixed, with, metals, are, more, like, metals, elasticity, and, general, chemical, behaviour, are, more, like, nonmetals, electrical, conductivity, band, structure, ionization, energy, electronegativity, and, oxides, are, intermediate, between, the, two, metalloids, are, too, brittle, to, have, any, structural, uses, in, their, pure, forms, they, and, their, compounds, are, used, in, alloys, biological, agents, toxicological, nutritional, and, medicinal, catalysts, flame, retardants, glasses, oxide, and, metallic, optical, storage, media, and, optoelectronics, pyrotechnics, semiconductors, and, electronics, writing, early, in, the, history, of, intermetallic, compounds, the, british, metallurgist, cecil, desch, observed, that, certain, non, metallic, elements, are, capable, of, forming, compounds, of, distinctly, metallic, character, with, metals, and, these, elements, may, therefore, enter, into, the, composition, of, alloys, he, associated, silicon, arsenic, and, tellurium, in, particular, with, the, alloy, forming, elements, phillips, and, williams, suggested, that, compounds, of, silicon,

behaviour, of, aluminium, it, resembles, a, weak, metal, in, its, amphoteric, oxide, and, in, the, covalent, character, of, many, of, its, compounds, yet, it, is, a, highly, electropositive, metal, a, high, negative, electrode, potential, moody, says, that, aluminium, is, on, the, diagonal, borderland, between, metals, and, non, metals, in, the, chemical, sense, selenium, shows, borderline, metalloid, or, nonmetal, behaviour, its, most, stable, form, the, grey, trigonal, allotrope, is, sometimes, called, metallic, selenium, because, its, electrical, conductivity, is, several, orders, of, magnitude, greater, than, that, of, the, red, monoclinic, form, the, metallic, character, of, selenium, is, further, shown, by, its, lustre, and, its, crystalline, structure, which, is, thought, to, include, weakly, metallic, interchain, bonding, selenium, can, be, drawn, into, thin, threads, when, molten, and, viscous, it, shows, reluctance, to, acquire, the, high, positive, oxidation, numbers, characteristic, of, nonmetals, it, can, form, cyclic, polycations, such, as, se, 2, 8, when, dissolved, in, oleums, an, attribute, it, shares, with, sulfur, and, tellurium, and, a, hydrolysed, cationic, salt, in, the, form, of, trihydroxoselenium, iv, perchlorate, clo, 4, the, nonmetallic, character, of, selenium, is, shown, by, its, brittleness, and, the, low, electrical, conductivity, 10, 9, to, 10, 12, s, cm, 1, of, its, highly, purified, form, this, is, comparable, to, or, less, than, that, of, bromine, 7, 95, 10, 12, s, cm, 1, a, nonmetal, selenium, has, the, electronic, band, structure, of, a, semiconductor, and, retains, its, semiconducting, properties, in, liquid, form, it, has, a, relatively, high, electronegativity, 2, 55, revised, pauling, scale, its, reaction, chemistry, is, mainly, that, of, its, nonmetallic, anionic, forms, se, 2, seo, 2, 3, and, seo, 2, 4, selenium, is, commonly, described, as, a, metalloid, in, the, environmental, chemistry, literature, it, moves, through, the, aquatic, environment, similarly, to, arsenic, and, antimony, its, water, soluble, salts, in, higher, concentrations, have, a, similar, toxicological, profile, to, that, of, arsenic, polonium, is, distinctly, metallic, in, some, ways, both, of, its, allotropic, forms, are, metallic, conductors, it, is, soluble, in, acids, forming, the, rose, coloured, po, 2, cation, and, displacing, hydrogen, po, 2, h, po, 2, h, 2, many, polonium, salts, are, known, the, oxide, poo, 2, is, predominantly, basic, in, nature, polonium, is, a, reluctant, oxidizing, agent, unlike, its, lightest, congener, oxygen, highly, reducing, conditions, are, required, for, the, formation, of, the, po, 2, anion, in, aqueous, solution, whether, polonium, is, ductile, or, brittle, is, unclear, it, is, predicted, to, be, ductile, based, on, its, calculated, elastic, constants, it, has, a, simple, cubic, crystalline, structure, such, a, structure, has, few, slip, systems, and, leads, to, very, low, ductility, and, hence, low, fracture, resistance, polonium, shows, nonmetallic, character, in, its, halides, and, by, the, existence, of, polonides, the, halides, have, properties, generally, characteristic, of, nonmetal, halides, being, volatile, easily, hydrolyzed, and, soluble, in, organic, solvents, many, metal, polonides, obtained, by, heating, the, elements, together, at, 500, 1, 000, c, and, containing, the, po, 2, anion, are, also, known, as, a, halogen, astatine, tends, to, be, classified, as, a, nonmetal, it, has, some, marked, metallic, properties, and, is, sometimes, instead, classified, as, either, a, metalloid, or, less, often, as, a, metal, immediately, following, its, production, in, 1940, early, investigators, considered, it, a, metal, in, 1949, it, was, called, the, most, noble, difficult, to, reduce, nonmetal, as, well, as, being, a, relatively, noble, difficult, to, oxidize, metal, in, 1950, astatine, was, described, as, a, halogen, and, therefore, a, reactive, nonmetal, in, 2013, on, the, basis, of, relativistic, modelling, astatine, was, predicted, to, be, a, monatomic, metal, with, a, face, centred, cubic, crystalline, structure, several, authors, have, commented, on, the, metallic, nature, of, some, of, the, properties, of, astatine, since, iodine, is, a, semiconductor, in, the, direction, of, its, planes, and, since, the, halogens, become, more, metallic, with, increasing, atomic, number, it, has, been, presumed, that, astatine, would, be, a, metal, if, it, could, form, a, condensed, phase, astatine, may, be, metallic, in, the, liquid, state, on, the, basis, that, elements, with, an, enthalpy, of, vaporization, h, vap, greater, than, 42, kj, mol, are, metallic, when, liquid, such, elements, include, boron, silicon, germanium, antimony, selenium, and, tellurium, estimated, values, for, h, vap, of, diatomic, astatine, are, 50, kj, mol, or, higher, diatomic, iodine, with, a, h, vap, of, 41, 71, falls, just, short, of, the, threshold, figure, like, typical, metals, it, is, precipitated, by, hydrogen, sulfide, even, from, strongly, acid, solutions, and, is, displaced, in, a, free, form, from, sulfate, solutions, it, is, deposited, on, the, cathode, on, electrolysis, further, indications, of, a, tendency, for, astatine, to, behave, like, a, heavy, metal, are, the, formation, of, pseudohalide, compounds, complexes, of, astatine, cations, complex, anions, of, trivalent, astatine, as, well, as, complexes, with, a, variety, of, organic, solvents, it, has, also, been, argued, that, astatine, demonstrates, cationic, behaviour, by, way, of, stable, at, and, ato, forms, in, strongly, acidic, aqueous, solutions, some, of, astatine, s, reported, properties, are, nonmetallic, it, has, been, extrapolated, to, have, the, narrow, liquid, range, ordinarily, associated, with, nonmetals, mp, 302, c, bp, 337, c, although, experimental, indications, suggest, a, lower, boiling, point, of, about, 230, 3, c, batsanov, gives, a, calculated, band, gap, energy, for, astatine, of, 0, 7, ev, this, is, consistent, with, nonmetals, in, physics, having, separated, valence, and, conduction, bands, and, thereby, being, either, semiconductors, or, insulators, the, chemistry, of, astatine, in, aqueous, solution, is, mainly, characterised, by, the, formation, of, various, anionic, species, most, of, its, known, compounds, resemble, those, of, iodine, which, is, a, halogen, and, a, nonmetal, such, compounds, include, astatides, xat, astatates, xato, 3, and, monovalent, interhalogen, compounds, restrepo, et, al, reported, that, astatine, appeared, to, be, more, polonium, like, than, halogen, like, they, did, so, on, the, basis, of, detailed, comparative, studies, of, the, known, and, interpolated, properties, of, 72, elements, in, the, periodic, table, some, of, the, elements, adjacent, to, the, commonly, recognised, metalloids, although, usually, classified, as, either, metals, or, nonmetals, are, occasionally, referred, to, as, near, metalloids, or, noted, for, their, metalloidal, character, to, the, left, of, the, metal, nonmetal, dividing, line, such, elements, include, gallium, tin, and, bismuth, they, show, unusual, packing, structures, marked, covalent, chemistry, molecular, or, polymeric, and, amphoterism, to, the, right, of, the, dividing, line, are, carbon, phosphorus, selenium, and, iodine, they, exhibit, metallic, lustre, semiconducting, properties, and, bonding, or, valence, bands, with, delocalized, character, this, applies, to, their, most, thermodynamically, stable, forms, under, ambient, conditions, carbon, as, graphite, phosphorus, as, black, phosphorus, and, selenium, as, grey, selenium, different, crystalline, forms, of, an, element, are, called, allotropes, some, allotropes, particularly, those, of, elements, located, in, periodic, table, terms, alongside, or, near, the, notional, dividing, line, between, metals, and, nonmetals, exhibit, more, pronounced, metallic, metalloidal, or, nonmetallic, behaviour, than, others, the, existence, of, such, allotropes, can, complicate, the, classification, of, the, elements, involved, tin, for, example, has, two, allotropes, tetragonal, white, tin, and, cubic, grey, tin, white, tin, is, a, very, shiny, ductile, and, malleable, metal, it, is, the, stable, form, at, or, above, room, temperature, and, has, an, electrical, conductivity, of, 9, 17, 10, 4, s, cm, 1, 1, 6th, that, of, copper, grey, tin, usually, has, the, appearance, of, a, grey, micro, crystalline, powder, and, can, also, be, prepared, in, brittle, semi, lustrous, crystalline, or, polycrystalline, forms, it, is, the, stable, form, below, 13, 2, c, and, has, an, electrical, conductivity, of, between, 2, 5, 10, 2, s, cm, 1, 1, 250th, that, of, white, tin, grey, tin, has, the, same, crystalline, structure, as, that, of, diamond, it, behaves, as, a, semiconductor, as, if, it, had, a, band, gap, of, 0, 08, ev, but, has, the, electronic, band, structure, of, a, semimetal, it, has, been, referred, to, as, either, a, very, poor, metal, a, metalloid, a, nonmetal, or, a, near, metalloid, the, diamond, allotrope, of, carbon, is, clearly, nonmetallic, being, translucent, and, having, a, low, electrical, conductivity, of, 10, 14, to, 10, 16, s, cm, 1, graphite, has, an, electrical, conductivity, of, 3, 10, 4, s, cm, 1, a, figure, more, characteristic, of, a, metal, phosphorus, sulfur, arsenic, selenium, antimony, and, bismuth, also, have, less, stable, allotropes, that, display, different, behaviours, the, table, gives, crustal, abundances, of, the, elements, commonly, to, rarely, recognised, as, metalloids, some, other, elements, are, included, for, comparison, oxygen, and, xenon, the, most, and, least, abundant, elements, with, stable, isotopes, iron, and, the, coinage, metals, copper, silver, and, gold, and, rhenium, the, least, abundant, stable, metal, aluminium, is, normally, the, most, abundant, metal, various, abundance, estimates, have, been, published, these, often, disagree, to, some, extent, the, recognised, metalloids, can, be, obtained, by, chemical, reduction, of, either, their, oxides, or, their, sulfides, simpler, or, more, complex, extraction, methods, may, be, employed, depending, on, the, starting, form, and, economic, factors, boron, is, routinely, obtained, by, reducing, the, trioxide, with, magnesium, b, 2, o, 3, 3, mg, 2, b, 3mgo, after, secondary, processing, the, resulting, brown, powder, has, a, purity, of, up, to, 97, boron, of, higher, purity, 99, is, prepared, by, heating, volatile, boron, compounds, such, as, bcl, 3, or, bbr, 3, either, in, a, hydrogen, atmosphere, 2, bx, 3, 3, h, 2, 2, b, 6, hx, or, to, the, point, of, thermal, decomposition,
