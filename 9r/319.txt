in, chemistry, valence, bond, vb, theory, is, one, of, the, two, basic, theories, along, with, molecular, orbital, mo, theory, that, were, developed, to, use, the, methods, of, quantum, mechanics, to, explain, chemical, bonding, it, focuses, on, how, the, atomic, orbitals, of, the, dissociated, atoms, combine, to, give, individual, chemical, bonds, when, a, molecule, is, formed, in, contrast, molecular, orbital, theory, has, orbitals, that, cover, the, whole, molecule, in, 1916, g, n, lewis, proposed, that, a, chemical, bond, forms, by, the, interaction, of, two, shared, bonding, electrons, with, the, representation, of, molecules, as, lewis, structures, the, chemist, charles, rugeley, bury, suggested, in, 1921, that, eight, and, eighteen, electrons, in, a, shell, form, stable, configurations, bury, proposed, that, the, electron, configurations, in, transitional, elements, depended, upon, the, valence, electrons, in, their, outer, shell, in, 1916, kossel, put, forth, his, theory, of, the, ionic, chemical, bond, octet, rule, also, independently, advanced, in, the, same, year, by, gilbert, n, lewis, walther, kossel, put, forward, a, theory, similar, to, lewis, only, his, model, assumed, complete, transfers, of, electrons, between, atoms, and, was, thus, a, model, of, ionic, bonding, both, lewis, and, kossel, structured, their, bonding, models, on, that, of, abegg, s, rule, 1904, although, there, is, no, mathematical, formula, either, in, chemistry, or, quantum, mechanics, for, the, arrangement, of, electrons, in, the, atom, the, hydrogen, atom, can, be, described, by, the, schr, dinger, equation, and, the, matrix, mechanics, equation, both, derived, in, 1925, however, for, hydrogen, alone, in, 1927, the, heitler, london, theory, was, formulated, which, for, the, first, time, enabled, the, calculation, of, bonding, properties, of, the, hydrogen, molecule, h, 2, based, on, quantum, mechanical, considerations, specifically, walter, heitler, determined, how, to, use, schr, dinger, s, wave, equation, 1926, to, show, how, two, hydrogen, atom, wavefunctions, join, together, with, plus, minus, and, exchange, terms, to, form, a, covalent, bond, he, then, called, up, his, associate, fritz, london, and, they, worked, out, the, details, of, the, theory, over, the, course, of, the, night, later, linus, pauling, used, the, pair, bonding, ideas, of, lewis, together, with, heitler, london, theory, to, develop, two, other, key, concepts, in, vb, theory, resonance, 1928, and, orbital, hybridization, 1930, according, to, charles, coulson, author, of, the, noted, 1952, book, valence, this, period, marks, the, start, of, modern, valence, bond, theory, as, contrasted, with, older, valence, bond, theories, which, are, essentially, electronic, theories, of, valence, couched, in, pre, wave, mechanical, terms, linus, pauling, published, in, 1931, his, landmark, paper, on, valence, bond, theory, on, the, nature, of, the, chemical, bond, building, on, this, article, pauling, s, 1939, textbook, on, the, nature, of, the, chemical, bond, would, become, what, some, have, called, the, bible, of, modern, chemistry, this, book, helped, experimental, chemists, to, understand, the, impact, of, quantum, theory, on, chemistry, however, the, later, edition, in, 1959, failed, to, adequately, address, the, problems, that, appeared, to, be, better, understood, by, molecular, orbital, theory, the, impact, of, valence, theory, declined, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, as, molecular, orbital, theory, grew, in, usefulness, as, it, was, implemented, in, large, digital, computer, programs, since, the, 1980s, the, more, difficult, problems, of, implementing, valence, bond, theory, into, computer, programs, have, been, solved, largely, and, valence, bond, theory, has, seen, a, resurgence, according, to, this, theory, a, covalent, bond, is, formed, between, two, atoms, by, the, overlap, of, half, filled, valence, atomic, orbitals, of, each, atom, containing, one, unpaired, electron, a, valence, bond, structure, is, similar, to, a, lewis, structure, but, where, a, single, lewis, structure, cannot, be, written, several, valence, bond, structures, are, used, each, of, these, vb, structures, represents, a, specific, lewis, structure, this, combination, of, valence, bond, structures, is, the, main, point, of, resonance, theory, valence, bond, theory, considers, that, the, overlapping, atomic, orbitals, of, the, participating, atoms, form, a, chemical, bond, because, of, the, overlapping, it, is, most, probable, that, electrons, should, be, in, the, bond, region, valence, bond, theory, views, bonds, as, weakly, coupled, orbitals, small, overlap, valence, bond, theory, is, typically, easier, to, employ, in, ground, state, molecules, the, core, orbitals, and, electrons, remain, essentially, unchanged, during, the, formation, of, bonds, the, overlapping, atomic, orbitals, can, differ, the, two, types, of, overlapping, orbitals, are, sigma, and, pi, sigma, bonds, occur, when, the, orbitals, of, two, shared, electrons, overlap, head, to, head, pi, bonds, occur, when, two, orbitals, overlap, when, they, are, parallel, for, example, a, bond, between, two, s, orbital, electrons, is, a, sigma, bond, because, two, spheres, are, always, coaxial, in, terms, of, bond, order, single, bonds, have, one, sigma, bond, double, bonds, consist, of, one, sigma, bond, and, one, pi, bond, and, triple, bonds, contain, one, sigma, bond, and, two, pi, bonds, however, the, atomic, orbitals, for, bonding, may, be, hybrids, often, the, bonding, atomic, orbitals, have, a, character, of, several, possible, types, of, orbitals, the, methods, to, get, an, atomic, orbital, with, the, proper, character, for, the, bonding, is, called, hybridization, valence, bond, theory, complements, molecular, orbital, theory, which, does, not, adhere, to, the, valence, bond, idea, that, electron, pairs, are, localized, between, two, specific, atoms, in, a, molecule, but, that, they, are, distributed, in, sets, of, molecular, orbitals, which, can, extend, over, the, entire, molecule, molecular, orbital, theory, can, predict, magnetic, and, ionization, properties, in, a, straightforward, manner, while, valence, bond, theory, gives, similar, results, but, is, more, complicated, valence, bond, theory, views, aromatic, properties, of, molecules, as, due, to, spin, coupling, of, the, orbitals, this, is, essentially, still, the, old, idea, of, resonance, between, friedrich, august, kekul, von, stradonitz, and, james, dewar, structures, in, contrast, molecular, orbital, theory, views, aromaticity, as, delocalization, of, the, electrons, valence, bond, treatments, are, restricted, to, relatively, small, molecules, largely, due, to, the, lack, of, orthogonality, between, valence, bond, orbitals, and, between, valence, bond, structures, while, molecular, orbitals, are, orthogonal, on, the, other, hand, valence, bond, theory, provides, a, much, more, accurate, picture, of, the, reorganization, of, electronic, charge, that, takes, place, when, bonds, are, broken, and, formed, during, the, course, of, a, chemical, reaction, in, particular, valence, bond, theory, correctly, predicts, the, dissociation, of, homonuclear, diatomic, molecules, into, separate, atoms, while, simple, molecular, orbital, theory, predicts, dissociation, into, a, mixture, of, atoms, and, ions, for, example, the, molecular, orbital, function, for, dihydrogen, is, an, equal, mixture, of, the, covalent, and, ionic, valence, bond, structures, and, so, predicts, incorrectly, that, the, molecule, would, dissociate, into, an, equal, mixture, of, hydrogen, atoms, and, hydrogen, positive, and, negative, ions, modern, valence, bond, theory, replaces, the, overlapping, atomic, orbitals, by, overlapping, valence, bond, orbitals, that, are, expanded, over, a, large, number, of, basis, functions, either, centered, each, on, one, atom, to, give, a, classical, valence, bond, picture, or, centered, on, all, atoms, in, the, molecule, the, resulting, energies, are, more, competitive, with, energies, from, calculations, where, electron, correlation, is, introduced, based, on, a, hartree, fock, reference, wavefunction, the, most, recent, text, is, by, shaik, and, hiberty, an, important, aspect, of, the, valence, bond, theory, is, the, condition, of, maximum, overlap, which, leads, to, the, formation, of, the, strongest, possible, bonds, this, theory, is, used, to, explain, the, covalent, bond, formation, in, many, molecules, for, example, in, the, case, of, the, f, 2, molecule, the, f, f, bond, is, formed, by, the, overlap, of, p, z, orbitals, of, the, two, f, atoms, each, containing, an, unpaired, electron, since, the, nature, of, the, overlapping, orbitals, are, different, in, h, 2, and, f, 2, molecules, the, bond, strength, and, bond, lengths, differ, between, h, 2, and, f, 2, molecules, in, an, hf, molecule, the, covalent, bond, is, formed, by, the, overlap, of, the, 1, s, orbital, of, h, and, the, 2, p, z, orbital, of, f, each, containing, an, unpaired, electron, mutual, sharing, of, electrons, between, h, and, f, results, in, a, covalent, bond, in, hf, using, modern, classical, valence, bond, theory, patil, and, bhanage, have, shown, that, the, cation, anion, interface, of, protic, ionic, liquids, possesses, charge, shift, bond, character
