the, cretaceous, ipa, k, r, t, e, s, krih, tay, sh, ss, is, a, geological, period, that, lasted, from, about, 145, to, 66, million, years, ago, mya, it, is, the, third, and, final, period, of, the, mesozoic, era, as, well, as, the, longest, at, around, 79, million, years, it, is, the, longest, geological, period, of, the, entire, phanerozoic, the, name, is, derived, from, the, latin, creta, chalk, which, is, abundant, in, the, latter, half, of, the, period, it, is, usually, abbreviated, k, for, its, german, translation, kreide, the, cretaceous, was, a, period, with, a, relatively, warm, climate, resulting, in, high, eustatic, sea, levels, that, created, numerous, shallow, inland, seas, these, oceans, and, seas, were, populated, with, now, extinct, marine, reptiles, ammonites, and, rudists, while, dinosaurs, continued, to, dominate, on, land, the, world, was, largely, ice, free, although, there, is, some, evidence, of, brief, periods, of, glaciation, during, the, cooler, first, half, and, forests, extended, to, the, poles, during, this, time, new, groups, of, mammals, and, birds, appeared, during, the, early, cretaceous, flowering, plants, appeared, and, began, to, rapidly, diversify, becoming, the, dominant, group, of, plants, across, the, earth, by, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, coincident, with, the, decline, and, extinction, of, previously, widespread, gymnosperm, groups, the, cretaceous, along, with, the, mesozoic, ended, with, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, a, large, mass, extinction, in, which, many, groups, including, non, avian, dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and, large, marine, reptiles, died, out, widely, thought, to, have, been, caused, by, the, impact, of, a, large, asteroid, that, formed, the, chicxulub, crater, in, the, gulf, of, mexico, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, is, defined, by, the, abrupt, cretaceous, paleogene, boundary, k, pg, boundary, a, geologic, signature, associated, with, the, mass, extinction, that, lies, between, the, mesozoic, and, cenozoic, eras, the, cretaceous, as, a, separate, period, was, first, defined, by, belgian, geologist, jean, d, omalius, d, halloy, in, 1822, as, the, terrain, cr, tac, using, strata, in, the, paris, basin, and, named, for, the, extensive, beds, of, chalk, calcium, carbonate, deposited, by, the, shells, of, marine, invertebrates, principally, coccoliths, found, in, the, upper, cretaceous, of, western, europe, the, name, cretaceous, was, derived, from, the, latin, creta, meaning, chalk, the, twofold, division, of, the, cretaceous, was, implemented, by, conybeare, and, phillips, in, 1822, alcide, d, orbigny, in, 1840, divided, the, french, cretaceous, into, five, tages, stages, the, neocomian, aptian, albian, turonian, and, senonian, later, adding, the, urgonian, between, neocomian, and, aptian, and, the, cenomanian, between, the, albian, and, turonian, the, cretaceous, is, divided, into, early, and, late, cretaceous, epochs, or, lower, and, upper, cretaceous, series, in, older, literature, the, cretaceous, is, sometimes, divided, into, three, series, neocomian, lower, early, gallic, middle, and, senonian, upper, late, a, subdivision, into, 12, stages, all, originating, from, european, stratigraphy, is, now, used, worldwide, in, many, parts, of, the, world, alternative, local, subdivisions, are, still, in, use, from, youngest, to, oldest, the, subdivisions, of, the, cretaceous, period, are, the, lower, boundary, of, the, cretaceous, is, currently, undefined, and, the, jurassic, cretaceous, boundary, is, currently, the, only, system, boundary, to, lack, a, defined, global, boundary, stratotype, section, and, point, gssp, placing, a, gssp, for, this, boundary, has, been, difficult, because, of, the, strong, regionality, of, most, biostratigraphic, markers, and, the, lack, of, any, chemostratigraphic, events, such, as, isotope, excursions, large, sudden, changes, in, ratios, of, isotopes, that, could, be, used, to, define, or, correlate, a, boundary, calpionellids, an, enigmatic, group, of, planktonic, protists, with, urn, shaped, calcitic, tests, briefly, abundant, during, the, latest, jurassic, to, earliest, cretaceous, have, been, suggested, as, the, most, promising, candidates, for, fixing, the, jurassic, cretaceous, boundary, in, particular, the, first, appearance, calpionella, alpina, coinciding, with, the, base, of, the, eponymous, alpina, subzone, has, been, proposed, as, the, definition, of, the, base, of, the, cretaceous, the, working, definition, for, the, boundary, has, often, been, placed, as, the, first, appearance, of, the, ammonite, strambergella, jacobi, formerly, placed, in, the, genus, berriasella, but, its, use, as, a, stratigraphic, indicator, has, been, questioned, as, its, first, appearance, does, not, correlate, with, that, of, c, alpina, the, boundary, is, officially, considered, by, the, international, commission, on, stratigraphy, to, be, approximately, 145, million, years, ago, but, other, estimates, have, been, proposed, based, on, u, pb, geochronology, ranging, as, young, as, 140, million, years, ago, the, upper, boundary, of, the, cretaceous, is, sharply, defined, being, placed, at, an, iridium, rich, layer, found, worldwide, that, is, believed, to, be, associated, with, the, chicxulub, impact, crater, with, its, boundaries, circumscribing, parts, of, the, yucat, n, peninsula, and, extending, into, the, gulf, of, mexico, this, layer, has, been, dated, at, 66, 043, mya, at, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, the, impact, of, a, large, body, with, the, earth, may, have, been, the, punctuation, mark, at, the, end, of, a, progressive, decline, in, biodiversity, during, the, maastrichtian, age, the, result, was, the, extinction, of, three, quarters, of, earth, s, plant, and, animal, species, the, impact, created, the, sharp, break, known, as, the, k, pg, boundary, formerly, known, as, the, k, t, boundary, earth, s, biodiversity, required, substantial, time, to, recover, from, this, event, despite, the, probable, existence, of, an, abundance, of, vacant, ecological, niches, despite, the, severity, of, the, k, pg, extinction, event, there, were, significant, variations, in, the, rate, of, extinction, between, and, within, different, clades, species, that, depended, on, photosynthesis, declined, or, became, extinct, as, atmospheric, particles, blocked, solar, energy, as, is, the, case, today, photosynthesizing, organisms, such, as, phytoplankton, and, land, plants, formed, the, primary, part, of, the, food, chain, in, the, late, cretaceous, and, all, else, that, depended, on, them, suffered, as, well, herbivorous, animals, which, depended, on, plants, and, plankton, as, their, food, died, out, as, their, food, sources, became, scarce, consequently, the, top, predators, such, as, tyrannosaurus, rex, also, perished, yet, only, three, major, groups, of, tetrapods, disappeared, completely, the, nonavian, dinosaurs, the, plesiosaurs, and, the, pterosaurs, the, other, cretaceous, groups, that, did, not, survive, into, the, cenozoic, era, the, ichthyosaurs, last, remaining, temnospondyls, koolasuchus, and, nonmammalian, cynodonts, tritylodontidae, were, already, extinct, millions, of, years, before, the, event, occurred, coccolithophorids, and, molluscs, including, ammonites, rudists, freshwater, snails, and, mussels, as, well, as, organisms, whose, food, chain, included, these, shell, builders, became, extinct, or, suffered, heavy, losses, for, example, ammonites, are, thought, to, have, been, the, principal, food, of, mosasaurs, a, group, of, giant, marine, lizards, related, to, snakes, that, became, extinct, at, the, boundary, omnivores, insectivores, and, carrion, eaters, survived, the, extinction, event, perhaps, because, of, the, increased, availability, of, their, food, sources, at, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, there, seem, to, have, been, no, purely, herbivorous, or, carnivorous, mammals, mammals, and, birds, that, survived, the, extinction, fed, on, insects, larvae, worms, and, snails, which, in, turn, fed, on, dead, plant, and, animal, matter, scientists, theorise, that, these, organisms, survived, the, collapse, of, plant, based, food, chains, because, they, fed, on, detritus, in, stream, communities, few, groups, of, animals, became, extinct, stream, communities, rely, less, on, food, from, living, plants, and, more, on, detritus, that, washes, in, from, land, this, particular, ecological, niche, buffered, them, from, extinction, similar, but, more, complex, patterns, have, been, found, in, the, oceans, extinction, was, more, severe, among, animals, living, in, the, water, column, than, among, animals, living, on, or, in, the, seafloor, animals, in, the, water, column, are, almost, entirely, dependent, on, primary, production, from, living, phytoplankton, while, animals, living, on, or, in, the, ocean, floor, feed, on, detritus, or, can, switch, to, detritus, feeding, the, largest, air, breathing, survivors, of, the, event, crocodilians, and, champsosaurs, were, semiaquatic, and, had, access, to, detritus, modern, crocodilians, can, live, as, scavengers, and, can, survive, for, months, without, food, and, go, into, hibernation, when, conditions, are, unfavorable, and, their, young, are, small, grow, slowly, and, feed, largely, on, invertebrates, and, dead, organisms, or, fragments, of, organisms, for, their, first, few, years, these, characteristics, have, been, linked, to, crocodilian, survival, at, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, the, high, sea, level, and, warm, climate, of, the, cretaceous, meant, large, areas, of, the, continents, were, covered, by, warm, shallow, seas, providing, habitat, for, many, marine, organisms, the, cretaceous, was, named, for, the, extensive, chalk, deposits, of, this, age, in, europe, but, in, many, parts, of, the, world, the, deposits, from, the, cretaceous, are, of, marine, limestone, a, rock, type, that, is, formed, under, warm, shallow, marine, conditions, due, to, the, high, sea, level, there, was, extensive, space, for, such, sedimentation, because, of, the, relatively, young, age, and, great, thickness, of, the, system, cretaceous, rocks, are, evident, in, many, areas, worldwide, chalk, is, a, rock, type, characteristic, for, but, not, restricted, to, the, cretaceous, it, consists, of, coccoliths, microscopically, small, calcite, skeletons, of, coccolithophores, a, type, of, algae, that, prospered, in, the, cretaceous, seas, stagnation, of, deep, sea, currents, in, middle, cretaceous, times, caused, anoxic, conditions, in, the, sea, water, leaving, the, deposited, organic, matter, undecomposed, half, of, the, world, s, petroleum, reserves, were, laid, down, at, this, time, in, the, anoxic, conditions, of, what, would, become, the, persian, gulf, and, the, gulf, of, mexico, in, many, places, around, the, world, dark, anoxic, shales, were, formed, during, this, interval, such, as, the, mancos, shale, of, western, north, america, these, shales, are, an, important, source, rock, for, oil, and, gas, for, example, in, the, subsurface, of, the, north, sea, in, northwestern, europe, chalk, deposits, from, the, upper, cretaceous, are, characteristic, for, the, chalk, group, which, forms, the, white, cliffs, of, dover, on, the, south, coast, of, england, and, similar, cliffs, on, the, french, normandian, coast, the, group, is, found, in, england, northern, france, the, low, countries, northern, germany, denmark, and, in, the, subsurface, of, the, southern, part, of, the, north, sea, chalk, is, not, easily, consolidated, and, the, chalk, group, still, consists, of, loose, sediments, in, many, places, the, group, also, has, other, limestones, and, arenites, among, the, fossils, it, contains, are, sea, urchins, belemnites, ammonites, and, sea, reptiles, such, as, mosasaurus, in, southern, europe, the, cretaceous, is, usually, a, marine, system, consisting, of, competent, limestone, beds, or, incompetent, marls, because, the, alpine, mountain, chains, did, not, yet, exist, in, the, cretaceous, these, deposits, formed, on, the, southern, edge, of, the, european, continental, shelf, at, the, margin, of, the, tethys, ocean, during, the, cretaceous, the, present, north, american, continent, was, isolated, from, the, other, continents, in, the, jurassic, the, north, atlantic, already, opened, leaving, a, proto, ocean, between, europe, and, north, america, from, north, to, south, across, the, continent, the, western, interior, seaway, started, forming, this, inland, sea, separated, the, elevated, areas, of, laramidia, in, the, west, and, appalachia, in, the, east, three, dinosaur, clades, found, in, laramidia, troodontids, therizinosaurids, and, oviraptorosaurs, are, absent, from, appalachia, from, the, coniacian, through, the, maastrichtian, during, the, cretaceous, the, late, paleozoic, to, early, mesozoic, supercontinent, of, pangaea, completed, its, tectonic, breakup, into, the, present, day, continents, although, their, positions, were, substantially, different, at, the, time, as, the, atlantic, ocean, widened, the, convergent, margin, mountain, building, orogenies, that, had, begun, during, the, jurassic, continued, in, the, north, american, cordillera, as, the, nevadan, orogeny, was, followed, by, the, sevier, and, laramide, orogenies, gondwana, had, begun, to, break, up, during, the, jurassic, period, but, its, fragmentation, accelerated, during, the, cretaceous, and, was, largely, complete, by, the, end, of, the, period, south, america, antarctica, and, australia, rifted, away, from, africa, though, india, and, madagascar, remained, attached, to, each, other, until, around, 80, million, years, ago, thus, the, south, atlantic, and, indian, oceans, were, newly, formed, such, active, rifting, lifted, great, undersea, mountain, chains, along, the, welts, raising, eustatic, sea, levels, worldwide, to, the, north, of, africa, the, tethys, sea, continued, to, narrow, during, most, of, the, late, cretaceous, north, america, would, be, divided, in, two, by, the, western, interior, seaway, a, large, interior, sea, separating, laramidia, to, the, west, and, appalachia, to, the, east, then, receded, late, in, the, period, leaving, thick, marine, deposits, sandwiched, between, coal, beds, bivalve, palaeobiogeography, also, indicates, that, africa, was, split, in, half, by, a, shallow, sea, during, the, coniacian, and, santonian, connecting, the, tethys, with, the, south, atlantic, by, way, of, the, central, sahara, and, central, africa, which, were, then, underwater, yet, another, shallow, seaway, ran, between, what, is, now, norway, and, greenland, connecting, the, tethys, to, the, arctic, ocean, and, enabling, biotic, exchange, between, the, two, oceans, at, the, peak, of, the, cretaceous, transgression, one, third, of, earth, s, present, land, area, was, submerged, the, cretaceous, is, justly, famous, for, its, chalk, indeed, more, chalk, formed, in, the, cretaceous, than, in, any, other, period, in, the, phanerozoic, mid, ocean, ridge, activity, or, rather, the, circulation, of, seawater, through, the, enlarged, ridges, enriched, the, oceans, in, calcium, this, made, the, oceans, more, saturated, as, well, as,

deccan, traps, were, erupted, in, the, very, late, cretaceous, and, early, paleocene, palynological, evidence, indicates, the, cretaceous, climate, had, three, broad, phases, a, berriasian, barremian, warm, dry, phase, an, aptian, santonian, warm, wet, phase, and, a, campanian, maastrichtian, cool, dry, phase, as, in, the, cenozoic, the, 400, 000, year, eccentricity, cycle, was, the, dominant, orbital, cycle, governing, carbon, flux, between, different, reservoirs, and, influencing, global, climate, the, location, of, the, intertropical, convergence, zone, itcz, was, roughly, the, same, as, in, the, present, the, cooling, trend, of, the, last, epoch, of, the, jurassic, the, tithonian, continued, into, the, berriasian, the, first, age, of, the, cretaceous, the, north, atlantic, seaway, opened, and, enabled, the, flow, of, cool, water, from, the, boreal, ocean, into, the, tethys, there, is, evidence, that, snowfalls, were, common, in, the, higher, latitudes, during, this, age, and, the, tropics, became, wetter, than, during, the, triassic, and, jurassic, glaciation, was, restricted, to, high, latitude, mountains, though, seasonal, snow, may, have, existed, farther, from, the, poles, after, the, end, of, the, first, age, however, temperatures, began, to, increase, again, with, a, number, of, thermal, excursions, such, as, the, middle, valanginian, weissert, thermal, excursion, wtx, which, was, caused, by, the, paran, etendeka, large, igneous, province, s, activity, it, was, followed, by, the, middle, hauterivian, faraoni, thermal, excursion, ftx, and, the, early, barremian, hauptblatterton, thermal, event, hte, the, hte, marked, the, ultimate, end, of, the, tithonian, early, barremian, cool, interval, tebci, during, this, interval, precession, was, the, dominant, orbital, driver, of, environmental, changes, in, the, vocontian, basin, for, much, of, the, tebci, northern, gondwana, experienced, a, monsoonal, climate, a, shallow, thermocline, existed, in, the, mid, latitude, tethys, the, tebci, was, followed, by, the, barremian, aptian, warm, interval, bawi, this, hot, climatic, interval, coincides, with, manihiki, and, ontong, java, plateau, volcanism, and, with, the, selli, event, early, aptian, tropical, sea, surface, temperatures, ssts, were, 27, 32, c, based, on, tex, 86, measurements, from, the, equatorial, pacific, during, the, aptian, milankovitch, cycles, governed, the, occurrence, of, anoxic, events, by, modulating, the, intensity, of, the, hydrological, cycle, and, terrestrial, runoff, the, early, aptian, was, also, notable, for, its, millennial, scale, hyperarid, events, in, the, mid, latitudes, of, asia, the, bawi, itself, was, followed, by, the, aptian, albian, cold, snap, aacs, that, began, about, 118, ma, a, short, relatively, minor, ice, age, may, have, occurred, during, this, so, called, cold, snap, as, evidenced, by, glacial, dropstones, in, the, western, parts, of, the, tethys, ocean, and, the, expansion, of, calcareous, nannofossils, that, dwelt, in, cold, water, into, lower, latitudes, the, aacs, is, associated, with, an, arid, period, in, the, iberian, peninsula, temperatures, increased, drastically, after, the, end, of, the, aacs, which, ended, around, 111, ma, with, the, paquier, urbino, thermal, maximum, giving, way, to, the, mid, cretaceous, hothouse, mkh, which, lasted, from, the, early, albian, until, the, early, campanian, faster, rates, of, seafloor, spreading, and, entry, of, carbon, dioxide, into, the, atmosphere, are, believed, to, have, initiated, this, period, of, extreme, warmth, along, with, high, flood, basalt, activity, the, mkh, was, punctuated, by, multiple, thermal, maxima, of, extreme, warmth, the, leenhardt, thermal, event, lte, occurred, around, 110, ma, followed, shortly, by, the, l, arboudeyesse, thermal, event, ate, a, million, years, later, following, these, two, hyperthermals, was, the, amadeus, thermal, maximum, around, 106, ma, during, the, middle, albian, then, around, a, million, years, after, that, occurred, the, petite, verol, thermal, event, pvte, afterwards, around, 102, 5, ma, the, event, 6, thermal, event, ev6, took, place, this, event, was, itself, followed, by, the, breistroffer, thermal, maximum, around, 101, ma, during, the, latest, albian, approximately, 94, ma, the, cenomanian, turonian, thermal, maximum, occurred, with, this, hyperthermal, being, the, most, extreme, hothouse, interval, of, the, cretaceous, and, being, associated, with, a, sea, level, highstand, temperatures, cooled, down, slightly, over, the, next, few, million, years, but, then, another, thermal, maximum, the, coniacian, thermal, maximum, happened, with, this, thermal, event, being, dated, to, around, 87, ma, atmospheric, co, 2, levels, may, have, varied, by, thousands, of, ppm, throughout, the, mkh, mean, annual, temperatures, at, the, poles, during, the, mkh, exceeded, 14, c, such, hot, temperatures, during, the, mkh, resulted, in, a, very, gentle, temperature, gradient, from, the, equator, to, the, poles, the, latitudinal, temperature, gradient, during, the, cenomanian, turonian, thermal, maximum, was, 0, 54, c, per, latitude, for, the, southern, hemisphere, and, 0, 49, c, per, latitude, for, the, northern, hemisphere, in, contrast, to, present, day, values, of, 1, 07, and, 0, 69, c, per, latitude, for, the, southern, and, northern, hemispheres, respectively, this, meant, weaker, global, winds, which, drive, the, ocean, currents, and, resulted, in, less, upwelling, and, more, stagnant, oceans, than, today, this, is, evidenced, by, widespread, black, shale, deposition, and, frequent, anoxic, events, tropical, ssts, during, the, late, albian, most, likely, averaged, around, 30, c, despite, this, high, sst,

42, c, an, intermediate, estimate, of, 33, 34, c, has, also, been, given, meanwhile, deep, ocean, temperatures, were, as, much, as, 15, to, 20, c, 27, to, 36, f, warmer, than, today, s, one, study, estimated, that, deep, ocean, temperatures, were, between, 12, and, 20, c, during, the, mkh, the, poles, were, so, warm, that, ectothermic, reptiles, were, able, to, inhabit, them, beginning, in, the, santonian, near, the, end, of, the, mkh, the, global, climate, began, to, cool, with, this, cooling, trend, continuing, across, the, campanian, this, period, of, cooling, driven, by, falling, levels,

very, end, of, the, cretaceous, was, triggered, by, the, activity, of, the, deccan, traps, the, lkepci, lasted, into, the, late, palaeocene, when, it, gave, way, to, another, supergreenhouse, interval, the, production, of, large, quantities, of, magma, variously, attributed, to, mantle, plumes, or, to, extensional, tectonics, further, pushed, sea, levels, up, so, that, large, areas, of, the, continental, crust, were, covered, with, shallow, seas, the, tethys, sea, connecting, the, tropical, oceans, east, to, west, also, helped, to, warm, the, global, climate, warm, adapted, plant, fossils, are, known, from, localities, as, far, north, as, alaska, and, greenland, while, dinosaur, fossils, have, been, found, within, 15, degrees, of, the, cretaceous, south, pole, it, was, suggested, that, there, was, antarctic, marine, glaciation, in, the, turonian, age, based, on, isotopic, evidence, however, this, has, subsequently, been, suggested, to, be, the, result, of,
