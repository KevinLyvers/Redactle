ionization, or, ionisation, specifically, in, britain, ireland, australia, and, new, zealand, is, the, process, by, which, an, atom, or, a, molecule, acquires, a, negative, or, positive, charge, by, gaining, or, losing, electrons, often, in, conjunction, with, other, chemical, changes, the, resulting, electrically, charged, atom, or, molecule, is, called, an, ion, ionization, can, result, from, the, loss, of, an, electron, after, collisions, with, subatomic, particles, collisions, with, other, atoms, molecules, electrons, positrons, protons, antiprotons, and, ions, or, through, the, interaction, with, electromagnetic, radiation, heterolytic, bond, cleavage, and, heterolytic, substitution, reactions, can, result, in, the, formation, of, ion, pairs, ionization, can, occur, through, radioactive, decay, by, the, internal, conversion, process, in, which, an, excited, nucleus, transfers, its, energy, to, one, of, the, inner, shell, electrons, causing, it, to, be, ejected, everyday, examples, of, gas, ionization, occur, within, a, fluorescent, lamp, or, other, electrical, discharge, lamps, it, is, also, used, in, radiation, detectors, such, as, the, geiger, m, ller, counter, or, the, ionization, chamber, the, ionization, process, is, widely, used, in, a, variety, of, equipment, in, fundamental, science, e, g, mass, spectrometry, and, in, medical, treatment, e, g, radiation, therapy, it, is, also, widely, used, for, air, purification, though, studies, have, shown, harmful, effects, of, this, application, negatively, charged, ions, are, produced, when, a, free, electron, collides, with, an, atom, and, is, subsequently, trapped, inside, the, electric, potential, barrier, releasing, any, excess, energy, the, process, is, known, as, electron, capture, ionization, positively, charged, ions, are, produced, by, transferring, an, amount, of, energy, to, a, bound, electron, in, a, collision, with, charged, particles, e, g, ions, electrons, or, positrons, or, with, photons, the, threshold, amount, of, the, required, energy, is, known, as, ionization, potential, the, study, of, such, collisions, is, of, fundamental, importance, with, regard, to, the, few, body, problem, which, is, one, of, the, major, unsolved, problems, in, physics, kinematically, complete, experiments, i, e, experiments, in, which, the, complete, momentum, vector, of, all, collision, fragments, the, scattered, projectile, the, recoiling, target, ion, and, the, ejected, electron, are, determined, have, contributed, to, major, advances, in, the, theoretical, understanding, of, the, few, body, problem, in, recent, years, adiabatic, ionization, is, a, form, of, ionization, in, which, an, electron, is, removed, from, or, added, to, an, atom, or, molecule, in, its, lowest, energy, state, to, form, an, ion, in, its, lowest, energy, state, the, townsend, discharge, is, a, good, example, of, the, creation, of, positive, ions, and, free, electrons, due, to, ion, impact, it, is, a, cascade, reaction, involving, electrons, in, a, region, with, a, sufficiently, high, electric, field, in, a, gaseous, medium, that, can, be, ionized, such, as, air, following, an, original, ionization, event, due, to, such, as, ionizing, radiation, the, positive, ion, drifts, towards, the, cathode, while, the, free, electron, drifts, towards, the, anode, of, the, device, if, the, electric, field, is, strong, enough, the, free, electron, gains, sufficient, energy, to, liberate, a, further, electron, when, it, next, collides, with, another, molecule, the, two, free, electrons, then, travel, towards, the, anode, and, gain, sufficient, energy, from, the, electric, field, to, cause, impact, ionization, when, the, next, collisions, occur, and, so, on, this, is, effectively, a, chain, reaction, of, electron, generation, and, is, dependent, on, the, free, electrons, gaining, sufficient, energy, between, collisions, to, sustain, the, avalanche, ionization, efficiency, is, the, ratio, of, the, number, of, ions, formed, to, the, number, of, electrons, or, photons, used, the, trend, in, the, ionization, energy, of, atoms, is, often, used, to, demonstrate, the, periodic, behavior, of, atoms, with, respect, to, the, atomic, number, as, summarized, by, ordering, atoms, in, mendeleev, s, table, this, is, a, valuable, tool, for, establishing, and, understanding, the, ordering, of, electrons, in, atomic, orbitals, without, going, into, the, details, of, wave, functions, or, the, ionization, process, an, example, is, presented, in, the, figure, to, the, right, the, periodic, abrupt, decrease, in, ionization, potential, after, rare, gas, atoms, for, instance, indicates, the, emergence, of, a, new, shell, in, alkali, metals, in, addition, the, local, maximums, in, the, ionization, energy, plot, moving, from, left, to, right, in, a, row, are, indicative, of, s, p, d, and, f, sub, shells, classical, physics, and, the, bohr, model, of, the, atom, can, qualitatively, explain, photoionization, and, collision, mediated, ionization, in, these, cases, during, the, ionization, process, the, energy, of, the, electron, exceeds, the, energy, difference, of, the, potential, barrier, it, is, trying, to, pass, the, classical, description, however, cannot, describe, tunnel, ionization, since, the, process, involves, the, passage, of, electron, through, a, classically, forbidden, potential, barrier, the, interaction, of, atoms, and, molecules, with, sufficiently, strong, laser, pulses, or, with, other, charged, particles, leads, to, the, ionization, to, singly, or, multiply, charged, ions, the, ionization, rate, i, e, the, ionization, probability, in, unit, time, can, be, calculated, using, quantum, mechanics, there, are, classical, methods, available, also, like, the, classical, trajectory, monte, carlo, method, ctmc, but, it, is, not, overall, accepted, and, often, criticized, by, the, community, there, are, two, quantum, mechanical, methods, exist, perturbative, and, non, perturbative, methods, like, time, dependent, coupled, channel, or, time, independent, close, coupling, methods, where, the, wave, function, is, expanded, in, a, finite, basis, set, there, are, numerous, options, available, e, g, b, splines, or, coulomb, wave, packets, another, non, perturbative, method, is, to, solve, the, corresponding, schr, dinger, equation, fully, numerically, on, a, lattice, in, general, the, analytic, solutions, are, not, available, and, the, approximations, required, for, manageable, numerical, calculations, do, not, provide, accurate, enough, results, however, when, the, laser, intensity, is, sufficiently, high, the, detailed, structure, of, the, atom, or, molecule, can, be, ignored, and, analytic, solution, for, the, ionization, rate, is, possible, tunnel, ionization, is, ionization, due, to, quantum, tunneling, in, classical, ionization, an, electron, must, have, enough, energy, to, make, it, over, the, potential, barrier, but, quantum, tunneling, allows, the, electron, simply, to, go, through, the, potential, barrier, instead, of, going, all, the, way, over, it, because, of, the, wave, nature, of, the, electron, the, probability, of, an, electron, s, tunneling, through, the, barrier, drops, off, exponentially, with, the, width, of, the, potential, barrier, therefore, an, electron, with, a, higher, energy, can, make, it, further, up, the, potential, barrier, leaving, a, much, thinner, barrier, to, tunnel, through, and, thus, a, greater, chance, to, do, so, in, practice, tunnel, ionization, is, observable, when, the, atom, or, molecule, is, interacting, with, near, infrared, strong, laser, pulses, this, process, can, be, understood, as, a, process, by, which, a, bounded, electron, through, the, absorption, of, more, than, one, photon, from, the, laser, field, is, ionized, this, picture, is, generally, known, as, multiphoton, ionization, mpi, keldysh, modeled, the, mpi, process, as, a, transition, of, the, electron, from, the, ground, state, of, the, atom, to, the, volkov, states, in, this, model, the, perturbation, of, the, ground, state, by, the, laser, field, is, neglected, and, the, details, of, atomic, structure, in, determining, the, ionization, probability, are, not, taken, into, account, the, major, difficulty, with, keldysh, s, model, was, its, neglect, of, the, effects, of, coulomb, interaction, on, the, final, state, of, the, electron, as, it, is, observed, from, figure, the, coulomb, field, is, not, very, small, in, magnitude, compared, to, the, potential, of, the, laser, at, larger, distances, from, the, nucleus, this, is, in, contrast, to, the, approximation, made, by, neglecting, the, potential, of, the, laser, at, regions, near, the, nucleus, perelomov, et, al, included, the, coulomb, interaction, at, larger, internuclear, distances, their, model, which, we, call, the, ppt, model, was, derived, for, short, range, potential, and, includes, the, effect, of, the, long, range, coulomb, interaction, through, the, first, order, correction, in, the, quasi, classical, action, larochelle, et, al, have, compared, the, theoretically, predicted, ion, versus, intensity, curves, of, rare, gas, atoms, interacting, with, a, ti, sapphire, laser, with, experimental, measurement, they, have, shown, that, the, total, ionization, rate, predicted, by, the, ppt, model, fit, very, well, the, experimental, ion, yields, for, all, rare, gases, in, the, intermediate, regime, of, the, keldysh, parameter, the, rate, of, mpi, on, atom, with, an, ionization, potential, e, i, displaystyle, e, i, in, a, linearly, polarized, laser, with, frequency, displaystyle, omega, is, given, by, where, the, coefficients, f, l, m, displaystyle, f, lm, g, displaystyle, g, gamma, and, c, n, l, displaystyle, c, n, l, are, given, by, the, coefficient, a, m, displaystyle, a, m, omega, gamma, is, given, by, where, the, quasi, static, tunneling, qst, is, the, ionization, whose, rate, can, be, satisfactorily, predicted, by, the, adk, model, i, e, the, limit, of, the, ppt, model, when, displaystyle, gamma, approaches, zero, the, rate, of, qst, is, given, by, as, compared, to, w, p, p, t, displaystyle, w, ppt, the, absence, of, summation, over, n, which, represent, different, above, threshold, ionization, ati, peaks, is, remarkable, the, calculations, of, ppt, are, done, in, the, e, gauge, meaning, that, the, laser, field, is, taken, as, electromagnetic, waves, the, ionization, rate, can, also, be, calculated, in, a, gauge, which, emphasizes, the, particle, nature, of, light, absorbing, multiple, photons, during, ionization, this, approach, was, adopted, by, krainov, model, based, on, the, earlier, works, of, faisal, and, reiss, the, resulting, rate, is, given, by, where, in, calculating, the, rate, of, mpi, of, atoms, only, transitions, to, the, continuum, states, are, considered, such, an, approximation, is, acceptable, as, long, as, there, is, no, multiphoton, resonance, between, the, ground, state, and, some, excited, states, however, in, real, situation, of, interaction, with, pulsed, lasers, during, the, evolution, of, laser, intensity, due, to, different, stark, shift, of, the, ground, and, excited, states, there, is, a, possibility, that, some, excited, state, go, into, multiphoton, resonance, with, the, ground, state, within, the, dressed, atom, picture, the, ground, state, dressed, by, m, displaystyle, m, photons, and, the, resonant, state, undergo, an, avoided, crossing, at, the, resonance, intensity, i, r, displaystyle, i, r, the, minimum, distance, v, m, displaystyle, v, m, at, the, avoided, crossing, is, proportional, to, the, generalized, rabi, frequency, t, m, i, t, m, 2, displaystyle, gamma, t, gamma, m, i, t, m, 2, coupling, the, two, states, according, to, story, et, al, the, probability, of, remaining, in, the, ground, state, p, g, displaystyle, p, g, is, given, by, where, w, displaystyle, w, is, the, time, dependent, energy, difference, between, the, two, dressed, states, in, interaction, with, a, short, pulse, if, the, dynamic, resonance, is, reached, in, the, rising, or, the, falling, part, of, the, pulse, the, population, practically, remains, in, the, ground, state, and, the, effect, of, multiphoton, resonances, may, be, neglected, however, if, the, states, go, onto, resonance, at, the, peak, of, the, pulse, where, d, w, d, t, 0, displaystyle, mathrm, d, w, mathrm, d, t, 0, then, the, excited, state, is, populated, after, being, populated, since, the, ionization, potential, of, the, excited, state, is, small, it, is, expected, that, the, electron, will, be, instantly, ionized, in, 1992, de, boer, and, muller, showed, that, xe, atoms, subjected, to, short, laser, pulses, could, survive, in, the, highly, excited, states, 4f, 5f, and, 6f, these, states, were, believed, to, have, been, excited, by, the, dynamic, stark, shift, of, the, levels, into, multiphoton, resonance, with, the, field, during, the, rising, part, of, the, laser, pulse, subsequent, evolution, of, the, laser, pulse, did, not, completely, ionize, these, states, leaving, behind, some, highly, excited, atoms, we, shall, refer, to, this, phenomenon, as, population, trapping, we, mention, the, theoretical, calculation, that, incomplete, ionization, occurs, whenever, there, is, parallel, resonant, excitation, into, a, common, level, with, ionization, loss, we, consider, a, state, such, as, 6f, of, xe, which, consists, of, 7, quasi, degnerate, levels, in, the, range, of, the, laser, bandwidth, these, levels, along, with, the, continuum, constitute, a, lambda, system, the, mechanism, of, the, lambda, type, trapping, is, schematically, presented, in, figure, at, the, rising, part, of, the, pulse, a, the, excited, state, with, two, degenerate, levels, 1, and, 2, are, not, in, multiphoton, resonance, with, the, ground, state, the, electron, is, ionized, through, multiphoton, coupling, with, the, continuum, as, the, intensity, of, the, pulse, is, increased, the, excited, state, and, the, continuum, are, shifted, in, energy, due, to, the, stark, shift, at, the, peak, of, the, pulse, b, the, excited, states, go, into, multiphoton, resonance, with, the, ground, state, as, the, intensity, starts, to, decrease, c, the, two, state, are, coupled, through, continuum, and, the, population, is, trapped, in, a, coherent, superposition, of, the, two, states, under, subsequent, action, of, the, same, pulse, due, to, interference, in, the, transition, amplitudes, of, the, lambda, system, the, field, cannot, ionize, the, population, completely, and, a, fraction, of, the, population, will, be, trapped, in, a, coherent, superposition, of, the, quasi, degenerate, levels, according, to, this, explanation, the, states, with, higher, angular, momentum, with, more, sublevels, would, have, a, higher, probability, of, trapping, the, population, in, general, the, strength, of, the, trapping, will, be, determined, by, the, strength, of, the, two, photon, coupling, between, the, quasi, degenerate, levels, via, the, continuum, in, 1996, using, a, very, stable, laser, and, by, minimizing, the, masking, effects, of, the, focal, region, expansion, with, increasing, intensity, talebpour, et, al, observed, structures, on, the, curves, of, singly, charged, ions, of, xe, kr, and, ar, these, structures, were, attributed, to, electron, trapping, in, the, strong, laser, field, a, more, unambiguous, demonstration, of, population, trapping, has, been, reported, by, t, morishita, and, c, d, lin, the, phenomenon, of, non, sequential, ionization, nsi, of, atoms, exposed, to, intense, laser, fields, has, been, a, subject, of, many, theoretical, and, experimental, studies, since, 1983, the, pioneering, work, began, with, the, observation, of, a, knee, structure, on, the, xe, 2, ion, signal, versus, intensity, curve, by, l, huillier, et, al, from, the, experimental, point, of, view, the, ns, double, ionization, refers, to, processes, which, somehow, enhance, the, rate, of, production, of, doubly, charged, ions, by, a, huge, factor, at, intensities, below, the, saturation, intensity, of, the, singly, charged, ion, many, on, the, other, hand, prefer, to, define, the, nsi, as, a, process, by, which, two, electrons, are, ionized, nearly, simultaneously, this, definition, implies, that, apart, from, the, sequential, channel, a, l, a, l, a, displaystyle, a, l, a, l, a, there, is, another, channel, a, l, a, displaystyle, a, l, a, which, is, the, main, contribution, to, the, production, of, doubly, charged, ions, at, lower, intensities, the, first, observation, of, triple, nsi, in, argon, interacting, with, a, 1, m, laser, was, reported, by, augst, et, al, later, systematically, studying, the, nsi, of, all, rare, gas, atoms, the, quadruple, nsi, of, xe, was, observed, the, most, important, conclusion, of, this, study, was, the, observation, of, the, following, relation, between, the, rate, of, nsi, to, any, charge, state, and, the, rate, of, tunnel, ionization, predicted, by, the, adk, formula, to, the, previous, charge, states, where, w, a, d, k, a, i, displaystyle, w, adk, left, a, i, right, is, the, rate, of, quasi, static, tunneling, to, i, th, charge, state, and, n, displaystyle, alpha, n, lambda, are, some, constants, depending, on, the, wavelength, of, the, laser, but, not, on, the, pulse, duration, two, models, have, been, proposed, to, explain, the, non, sequential, ionization, the, shake, off, model, and, electron, re, scattering, model, the, shake, off, so, model, first, proposed, by, fittinghoff, et, al, is, adopted, from, the, field, of, ionization, of, atoms, by, x, rays, and, electron, projectiles, where, the, so, process, is, one, of, the, major, mechanisms, responsible, for, the, multiple, ionization, of, atoms, the, so, model, describes, the, nsi, process, as, a, mechanism, where, one, electron, is, ionized, by, the, laser, field, and, the, departure, of, this, electron, is, so, rapid, that, the, remaining, electrons, do, not, have, enough, time, to, adjust, themselves, to, the, new, energy, states, therefore, there, is, a, certain, probability, that, after, the, ionization, of, the, first, electron, a, second, electron, is, excited, to, states, with, higher, energy, shake, up, or, even, ionized, shake, off, we, should, mention, that, until, now, there, has, been, no, quantitative, calculation, based, on, the, so, model, and, the, model, is, still, qualitative, the, electron, rescattering, model, was, independently, developed, by, kuchiev, schafer, et, al, corkum, becker, and, faisal, and, faisal, and, becker, the, principal, features, of, the, model, can, be, understood, easily, from, corkum, s, version, corkum, s, model, describes, the, ns, ionization, as, a, process, whereby, an, electron, is, tunnel, ionized, the, electron, then, interacts, with, the, laser, field, where, it, is, accelerated, away, from, the, nuclear, core, if, the, electron, has, been, ionized, at, an, appropriate, phase, of, the, field, it, will, pass, by, the, position, of, the, remaining, ion, half, a, cycle, later, where, it, can, free, an, additional, electron, by, electron, impact, only, half, of, the, time, the, electron, is, released, with, the, appropriate, phase, and, the, other, half, it, never, return, to, the, nuclear, core, the, maximum, kinetic, energy, that, the, returning, electron, can, have, is, 3, 17, times, the, ponderomotive, potential, u, p, displaystyle, u, p, of, the, laser, corkum, s, model, places, a, cut, off, limit, on, the, minimum, intensity, u, p, displaystyle, u, p, is, proportional, to, intensity, where, ionization, due, to, re, scattering, can, occur, the, re, scattering, model, in, kuchiev, s, version, kuchiev, s, model, is, quantum, mechanical, the, basic, idea, of, the, model, is, illustrated, by, feynman, diagrams, in, figure, a, first, both, electrons, are, in, the, ground, state, of, an, atom, the, lines, marked, a, and, b, describe, the, corresponding, atomic, states, then, the, electron, a, is, ionized, the, beginning, of, the, ionization, process, is, shown, by, the, intersection, with, a, sloped, dashed, line, where, the, mpi, occurs, the, propagation, of, the, ionized, electron, in, the, laser, field, during, which, it, absorbs, other, photons, ati, is, shown, by, the, full, thick, line, the, collision, of, this, electron, with, the, parent, atomic, ion, is, shown, by, a, vertical, dotted, line, representing, the, coulomb, interaction, between, the, electrons, the, state, marked, with, c, describes, the, ion, excitation, to, a, discrete, or, continuum, state, figure, b, describes, the, exchange, process, kuchiev, s, model, contrary, to, corkum, s, model, does, not, predict, any, threshold, intensity, for, the, occurrence, of, ns, ionization, kuchiev, did, not, include, the, coulomb, effects, on, the, dynamics, of, the, ionized, electron, this, resulted, in, the, underestimation, of, the, double, ionization, rate, by, a, huge, factor, obviously, in, the, approach, of, becker, and, faisal, which, is, equivalent, to, kuchiev, s, model, in, spirit, this, drawback, does, not, exist, in, fact, their, model, is, more, exact, and, does, not, suffer, from, the, large, number, of, approximations, made, by, kuchiev, their, calculation, results, perfectly, fit, with, the, experimental, results, of, walker, et, al, becker, and, faisal, have, been, able, to, fit, the, experimental, results, on, the, multiple, nsi, of, rare, gas, atoms, using, their, model, as, a, result, the, electron, re, scattering, can, be, taken, as, the, main, mechanism, for, the, occurrence, of, the, nsi, process, the, ionization, of, inner, valence, electrons, are, responsible, for, the, fragmentation, of, polyatomic, molecules, in, strong, laser, fields, according, to, a, qualitative, model, the, dissociation, of, the, molecules, occurs, through, a, three, step, mechanism, the, short, pulse, induced, molecular, fragmentation, may, be, used, as, an, ion, source, for, high, performance, mass, spectroscopy, the, selectivity, provided, by, a, short, pulse, based, source, is, superior, to, that, expected, when, using, the, conventional, electron, ionization, based, sources, in, particular, when, the, identification, of, optical, isomers, is, required, the, kramers, henneberger, frame, is, the, non, inertial, frame, moving, with, the, free, electron, under, the, influence, of, the, harmonic, laser, pulse, obtained, by, applying, a, translation, to, the, laboratory, frame, equal, to, the, quiver, motion, of, a, classical, electron, in, the, laboratory, frame, in, other, words, in, the, kramers, henneberger, frame, the, classical, electron, is, at, rest, starting, in, the, lab, frame, velocity, gauge, we, may, describe, the, electron, with, the, hamiltonian, in, the, dipole, approximation, the, quiver, motion, of, a, classical, electron, in, the, laboratory, frame, for, an, arbitrary, field, can, be, obtained, from, the, vector, potential, of, the, electromagnetic, field, where, 0, e, 0, 2, displaystyle, alpha, 0, equiv, e, 0, omega, 2, for, a, monochromatic, plane, wave, by, applying, a, transformation, to, the, laboratory, frame, equal, to, the, quiver, motion, t, displaystyle, mathbf, alpha, t, one, moves, to, the, oscillating, or, kramers, henneberger, frame, in, which, the, classical, electron, is, at, rest, by, a, phase, factor, transformation, for, convenience, one, obtains, the, space, translated, hamiltonian, which, is, unitarily, equivalent, to, the, lab, frame, hamiltonian, which, contains, the, original, potential, centered, on, the, oscillating, point, t, displaystyle, mathbf, alpha, t, the, utility, of, the, kh, frame, lies, in, the, fact, that, in, this, frame, the, laser, atom, interaction, can, be, reduced, to, the, form, of, an, oscillating, potential, energy, where, the, natural, parameters, describing, the, electron, dynamics, are, displaystyle, omega, and, 0, displaystyle, alpha, 0, sometimes, called, the, excursion, amplitude, obtained, from, t, displaystyle, mathbf, alpha, t, from, here, one, can, apply, floquet, theory, to, calculate, quasi, stationary, solutions, of, the, tdse, in, high, frequency, floquet, theory, to, lowest, order, in, 1, displaystyle, omega, 1, the, system, reduces, to, the, so, called, structure, equation, which, has, the, form, of, a, typical, energy, eigenvalue, schr, dinger, equation, containing, the, dressed, potential, v, 0, 0, r, displaystyle, v, 0, alpha, 0, mathbf, r, the, cycle, average, of, the, oscillating, potential, the, interpretation, of, the, presence, of, v, 0, displaystyle, v, 0, is, as, follows, in, the, oscillating, frame, the, nucleus, has, an, oscillatory, motion, of, trajectory, t, displaystyle, mathbf, alpha, t, and, v, 0, displaystyle, v, 0, can, be, seen, as, the, potential, of, the, smeared, out, nuclear, charge, along, its, trajectory, the, kh, frame, is, thus, employed, in, theoretical, studies, of, strong, field, ionization, and, atomic, stabilization, a, predicted, phenomenon, in, which, the, ionization, probability, of, an, atom, in, a, high, intensity, high, frequency, field, actually, decreases, for, intensities, above, a, certain, threshold, in, conjunction, with, high, frequency, floquet, theory, a, substance, may, dissociate, without, necessarily, producing, ions, as, an, example, the, molecules, of, table, sugar, dissociate, in, water, sugar, is, dissolved, but, exist, as, intact, neutral, entities, another, subtle, event, is, the, dissociation, of, sodium, chloride, table, salt, into, sodium, and, chlorine, ions, although, it, may, seem, as, a, case, of, ionization, in, reality, the, ions, already, exist, within, the, crystal, lattice, when, salt, is, dissociated, its, constituent, ions, are, simply, surrounded, by, water, molecules, and, their, effects, are, visible, e, g, the, solution, becomes, electrolytic, however, no, transfer, or, displacement, of, electrons, occurs
