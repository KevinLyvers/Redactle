neptune, is, the, eighth, and, farthest, known, planet, from, the, sun, it, is, the, fourth, largest, planet, in, the, solar, system, by, diameter, the, third, most, massive, planet, and, the, densest, giant, planet, it, is, 17, times, the, mass, of, earth, and, slightly, more, massive, but, denser, and, smaller, than, fellow, ice, giant, uranus, being, composed, primarily, of, gases, and, liquids, it, has, no, well, defined, solid, surface, and, orbits, the, sun, once, every, 164, 8, years, at, an, orbital, distance, of, 30, 1, astronomical, units, 4, 5, billion, kilometres, 2, 8, billion, miles, it, is, named, after, the, roman, god, of, the, sea, and, has, the, astronomical, symbol, representing, neptune, s, trident, neptune, is, not, visible, to, the, unaided, eye, and, is, the, only, planet, in, the, solar, system, that, was, found, from, mathematical, predictions, derived, from, indirect, observations, rather, than, being, initially, observed, by, direct, empirical, observation, when, unexpected, changes, in, the, orbit, of, uranus, led, alexis, bouvard, to, hypothesise, that, its, orbit, was, subject, to, gravitational, perturbation, by, an, unknown, planet, after, bouvard, s, death, the, position, of, neptune, was, predicted, from, his, observations, independently, by, john, couch, adams, and, urbain, le, verrier, neptune, was, subsequently, directly, observed, with, a, telescope, on, 23, september, 1846, by, johann, gottfried, galle, within, a, degree, of, the, position, predicted, by, le, verrier, its, largest, moon, triton, was, discovered, shortly, thereafter, though, none, of, the, planet, s, remaining, moons, were, located, telescopically, until, the, 20th, century, the, planet, s, distance, from, earth, gives, it, a, small, apparent, size, and, its, distance, from, the, sun, renders, it, very, dim, making, it, challenging, to, study, with, earth, based, telescopes, only, the, advent, of, the, hubble, space, telescope, and, of, large, ground, based, telescopes, with, adaptive, optics, allowed, for, detailed, observations, neptune, was, visited, by, voyager, 2, which, flew, by, the, planet, on, 25, august, 1989, voyager, 2, remains, the, only, spacecraft, to, have, visited, it, like, the, gas, giants, jupiter, and, saturn, neptune, s, atmosphere, is, composed, primarily, of, hydrogen, and, helium, along, with, traces, of, hydrocarbons, and, possibly, nitrogen, but, contains, a, higher, proportion, of, ices, such, as, water, ammonia, and, methane, similar, to, uranus, its, interior, is, primarily, composed, of, ices, and, rock, both, planets, are, normally, considered, ice, giants, to, distinguish, them, along, with, rayleigh, scattering, traces, of, methane, in, the, outermost, regions, make, neptune, appear, faintly, blue, in, contrast, to, the, strongly, seasonal, atmosphere, of, uranus, which, can, be, featureless, for, long, periods, of, time, neptune, s, atmosphere, has, active, and, consistently, visible, weather, patterns, at, the, time, of, the, voyager, 2, flyby, in, 1989, the, planet, s, southern, hemisphere, had, a, great, dark, spot, comparable, to, the, great, red, spot, on, jupiter, in, 2018, a, newer, main, dark, spot, and, smaller, dark, spot, were, identified, and, studied, these, weather, patterns, are, driven, by, the, strongest, sustained, winds, of, any, planet, in, the, solar, system, as, high, as, 2, 100, km, h, 580, m, s, 1, 300, mph, because, of, its, great, distance, from, the, sun, neptune, s, outer, atmosphere, is, one, of, the, coldest, places, in, the, solar, system, with, temperatures, at, its, cloud, tops, approaching, 55, k, 218, c, 361, f, temperatures, at, the, planet, s, centre, are, approximately, 5, 400, k, 5, 100, c, 9, 300, f, neptune, has, a, faint, and, fragmented, ring, system, labelled, arcs, discovered, in, 1984, and, confirmed, by, voyager, 2, some, of, the, earliest, known, telescopic, observations, ever, galileo, s, drawings, on, 28, dec, 1612, and, 27, jan, 1613, new, style, contain, plotted, points, that, match, what, is, now, known, to, have, been, the, positions, of, neptune, on, those, dates, both, times, galileo, seems, to, have, mistaken, neptune, for, a, fixed, star, when, it, appeared, close, in, conjunction, to, jupiter, in, the, night, sky, hence, he, is, not, credited, with, neptune, s, discovery, at, his, first, observation, in, dec, 1612, neptune, was, almost, stationary, in, the, sky, because, it, had, just, turned, retrograde, that, day, this, apparent, backward, motion, is, created, when, earth, s, orbit, takes, it, past, an, outer, planet, because, neptune, was, only, beginning, its, yearly, retrograde, cycle, the, motion, of, the, planet, was, far, too, slight, to, be, detected, with, galileo, s, small, telescope, in, 2009, a, study, suggested, that, galileo, was, at, least, aware, that, the, star, he, had, observed, had, moved, relative, to, fixed, stars, in, 1821, alexis, bouvard, published, astronomical, tables, of, the, orbit, of, uranus, subsequent, observations, revealed, substantial, deviations, from, the, tables, leading, bouvard, to, hypothesize, that, an, unknown, body, was, perturbing, the, orbit, through, gravitational, interaction, in, 1843, john, couch, adams, began, work, on, the, orbit, of, uranus, using, the, data, he, had, he, requested, extra, data, from, sir, george, airy, the, astronomer, royal, who, supplied, it, in, february, 1844, adams, continued, to, work, in, 1845, 1846, and, produced, several, different, estimates, of, a, new, planet, in, 1845, 1846, urbain, le, verrier, developed, his, own, calculations, independently, from, adams, but, aroused, no, enthusiasm, among, his, compatriots, in, june, 1846, upon, seeing, le, verrier, s, first, published, estimate, of, the, planet, s, longitude, and, its, similarity, to, adams, s, estimate, airy, persuaded, james, challis, to, search, for, the, planet, challis, vainly, scoured, the, sky, throughout, august, and, september, challis, had, in, fact, observed, neptune, a, year, before, the, planet, s, subsequent, discoverer, johann, gottfried, galle, and, on, two, occasions, 4, and, 12, august, 1845, however, his, out, of, date, star, maps, and, poor, observing, techniques, meant, that, he, failed, to, recognize, the, observations, as, such, until, he, carried, out, later, analysis, challis, was, full, of, remorse, but, blamed, his, neglect, on, his, maps, and, the, fact, that, he, was, distracted, by, his, concurrent, work, on, comet, observations, meanwhile, le, verrier, sent, a, letter, and, urged, berlin, observatory, astronomer, galle, to, search, with, the, observatory, s, refractor, heinrich, d, arrest, a, student, at, the, observatory, suggested, to, galle, that, they, could, compare, a, recently, drawn, chart, of, the, sky, in, the, region, of, le, verrier, s, predicted, location, with, the, current, sky, to, seek, the, displacement, characteristic, of, a, planet, as, opposed, to, a, fixed, star, on, the, evening, of, 23, september, 1846, the, day, galle, received, the, letter, he, discovered, neptune, just, northeast, of, iota, aquarii, 1, from, the, five, degrees, east, of, delta, capricorn, position, le, verrier, had, predicted, it, to, be, about, 12, from, adams, s, prediction, and, on, the, border, of, aquarius, and, capricornus, according, to, the, modern, iau, constellation, boundaries, in, the, wake, of, the, discovery, there, was, a, nationalistic, rivalry, between, the, french, and, the, british, over, who, deserved, credit, for, the, discovery, eventually, an, international, consensus, emerged, that, le, verrier, and, adams, deserved, joint, credit, since, 1966, dennis, rawlins, has, questioned, the, credibility, of, adams, s, claim, to, co, discovery, and, the, issue, was, re, evaluated, by, historians, with, the, return, in, 1998, of, the, neptune, papers, historical, documents, to, the, royal, observatory, greenwich, shortly, after, its, discovery, neptune, was, referred, to, simply, as, the, planet, exterior, to, uranus, or, as, le, verrier, s, planet, the, first, suggestion, for, a, name, came, from, galle, who, proposed, the, name, janus, in, england, challis, put, forward, the, name, oceanus, claiming, the, right, to, name, his, discovery, le, verrier, quickly, proposed, the, name, neptune, for, this, new, planet, though, falsely, stating, that, this, had, been, officially, approved, by, the, french, bureau, des, longitudes, in, october, he, sought, to, name, the, planet, le, verrier, after, himself, and, he, had, loyal, support, in, this, from, the, observatory, director, fran, ois, arago, this, suggestion, met, with, stiff, resistance, outside, france, french, almanacs, quickly, reintroduced, the, name, herschel, for, uranus, after, that, planet, s, discoverer, sir, william, herschel, and, leverrier, for, the, new, planet, struve, came, out, in, favour, of, the, name, neptune, on, 29, december, 1846, to, the, saint, petersburg, academy, of, sciences, after, the, colour, of, the, planet, as, viewed, through, a, telescope, soon, neptune, became, the, internationally, accepted, name, in, roman, mythology, neptune, was, the, god, of, the, sea, identified, with, the, greek, poseidon, the, demand, for, a, mythological, name, seemed, to, be, in, keeping, with, the, nomenclature, of, the, other, planets, all, of, which, were, named, for, deities, in, greek, and, roman, mythology, most, languages, today, use, some, variant, of, the, name, neptune, for, the, planet, in, chinese, vietnamese, japanese, and, korean, the, planet, s, name, was, translated, as, sea, king, star, in, mongolian, neptune, is, called, dalain, van, reflecting, its, namesake, god, s, role, as, the, ruler, of, the, sea, in, modern, greek, the, planet, is, called, poseidon, poseidonas, the, greek, counterpart, of, neptune, in, hebrew, rahab, from, a, biblical, sea, monster, mentioned, in, the, book, of, psalms, was, selected, in, a, vote, managed, by, the, academy, of, the, hebrew, language, in, 2009, as, the, official, name, for, the, planet, even, though, the, existing, latin, term, neptun, is, commonly, used, in, m, ori, the, planet, is, called, tangaroa, named, after, the, m, ori, god, of, the, sea, in, nahuatl, the, planet, is, called, tl, locc, tlalli, named, after, the, rain, god, tl, loc, in, thai, neptune, is, referred, to, by, the, westernised, name, dao, nepchun, nepjun, but, is, also, called, dao, ket, lit, star, of, ketu, after, ketu, the, descending, lunar, node, who, plays, a, role, in, hindu, astrology, in, malay, the, name, waruna, after, the, hindu, god, of, seas, is, attested, as, far, back, as, the, 1970s, but, was, eventually, superseded, by, the, latinate, equivalents, neptun, in, malaysian, or, neptunus, in, indonesian, the, usual, adjectival, form, is, neptunian, the, nonce, form, poseidean, p, s, a, d, i, n, from, poseidon, has, also, been, used, though, the, usual, adjectival, form, of, poseidon, is, poseidonian, p, s, a, d, o, n, i, n, from, its, discovery, in, 1846, until, the, discovery, of, pluto, in, 1930, neptune, was, the, farthest, known, planet, when, pluto, was, discovered, it, was, considered, a, planet, and, neptune, thus, became, the, second, farthest, known, planet, except, for, a, 20, year, period, between, 1979, and, 1999, when, pluto, s, elliptical, orbit, brought, it, closer, than, neptune, to, the, sun, making, neptune, the, ninth, planet, from, the, sun, during, this, period, the, increasingly, accurate, estimations, of, pluto, s, mass, from, ten, times, that, of, earth, s, to, far, less, than, that, of, the, moon, and, the, discovery, of, the, kuiper, belt, in, 1992, led, many, astronomers, to, debate, whether, pluto, should, be, considered, a, planet, or, as, part, of, the, kuiper, belt, in, 2006, the, international, astronomical, union, defined, the, word, planet, for, the, first, time, reclassifying, pluto, as, a, dwarf, planet, and, making, neptune, once, again, the, outermost, known, planet, in, the, solar, system, neptune, s, mass, of, 1, 0243, 10, 26, kg, is, intermediate, between, earth, and, the, larger, gas, giants, it, is, 17, times, that, of, earth, but, just, 1, 19th, that, of, jupiter, its, gravity, at, 1, bar, is, 11, 15, m, s, 2, 1, 14, times, the, surface, gravity, of, earth, and, surpassed, only, by, jupiter, neptune, s, equatorial, radius, of, 24, 764, km, is, nearly, four, times, that, of, earth, neptune, like, uranus, is, an, ice, giant, a, subclass, of, giant, planet, because, they, are, smaller, and, have, higher, concentrations, of, volatiles, than, jupiter, and, saturn, in, the, search, for, exoplanets, neptune, has, been, used, as, a, metonym, discovered, bodies, of, similar, mass, are, often, referred, to, as, neptunes, just, as, scientists, refer, to, various, extrasolar, bodies, as, jupiters, neptune, s, internal, structure, resembles, that, of, uranus, its, atmosphere, forms, about, 5, to, 10, of, its, mass, and, extends, perhaps, 10, to, 20, of, the, way, towards, the, core, pressure, in, the, atmosphere, reaches, about, 10, gpa, or, about, 10, 5, atmospheres, increasing, concentrations, of, methane, ammonia, and, water, are, found, in, the, lower, regions, of, the, atmosphere, the, mantle, is, equivalent, to, 10, to, 15, earth, masses, and, is, rich, in, water, ammonia, and, methane, as, is, customary, in, planetary, science, this, mixture, is, called, icy, even, though, it, is, a, hot, dense, supercritical, fluid, this, fluid, which, has, a, high, electrical, conductivity, is, sometimes, called, a, water, ammonia, ocean, the, mantle, may, consist, of, a, layer, of, ionic, water, in, which, the, water, molecules, break, down, into, a, soup, of, hydrogen, and, oxygen, ions, and, deeper, down, superionic, water, in, which, the, oxygen, crystallizes, but, the, hydrogen, ions, float, around, freely, within, the, oxygen, lattice, at, a, depth, of, 7, 000, km, the, conditions, may, be, such, that, methane, decomposes, into, diamond, crystals, that, rain, downwards, like, hailstones, scientists, believe, that, this, kind, of, diamond, rain, occurs, on, jupiter, saturn, and, uranus, very, high, pressure, experiments, at, lawrence, livermore, national, laboratory, suggest, that, the, top, of, the, mantle, may, be, an, ocean, of, liquid, carbon, with, floating, solid, diamonds, the, core, of, neptune, is, likely, composed, of, iron, nickel, and, silicates, with, an, interior, model, giving, a, mass, about, 1, 2x, that, of, earth, the, pressure, at, the, centre, is, 7, mbar, 700, gpa, about, twice, as, high, as, that, at, the, centre, of, earth, and, the, temperature, may, be, 5, 400, k, 5, 100, c, 9, 300, f, at, high, altitudes, neptune, s, atmosphere, is, 80, hydrogen, and, 19, helium, a, trace, amount, of, methane, is, present, prominent, absorption, bands, of, methane, exist, at, wavelengths, above, 600, nm, in, the, red, and, infrared, portion, of, the, spectrum, as, with, uranus, this, absorption, of, red, light, by, atmospheric, methane, is, part, of, what, gives, neptune, its, faint, blue, hue, which, is, more, pronounced, for, neptune, s, due, to, concentrated, haze, in, uranus, s, atmosphere, neptune, s, atmosphere, is, subdivided, into, two, main, regions, the, lower, troposphere, where, temperature, decreases, with, altitude, and, the, stratosphere, where, temperature, increases, with, altitude, the, boundary, between, the, two, the, tropopause, lies, at, a, pressure, of, 0, 1, bars, 10, kpa, the, stratosphere, then, gives, way, to, the, thermosphere, at, a, pressure, lower, than, 10, 5, to, 10, 4, bars, 1, to, 10, pa, the, thermosphere, gradually, transitions, to, the, exosphere, models, suggest, that, neptune, s, troposphere, is, banded, by, clouds, of, varying, compositions, depending, on, altitude, the, upper, level, clouds, lie, at, pressures, below, one, bar, where, the, temperature, is, suitable, for, methane, to, condense, for, pressures, between, one, and, five, bars, 100, and, 500, kpa, clouds, of, ammonia, and, hydrogen, sulfide, are, thought, to, form, above, a, pressure, of, five, bars, the, clouds, may, consist, of, ammonia, ammonium, sulfide, hydrogen, sulfide, and, water, deeper, clouds, of, water, ice, should, be, found, at, pressures, of, about, 50, bars, 5, 0, mpa, where, the, temperature, reaches, 273, k, 0, c, 32, f, underneath, clouds, of, ammonia, and, hydrogen, sulfide, may, be, found, high, altitude, clouds, on, neptune, have, been, observed, casting, shadows, on, the, opaque, cloud, deck, below, there, are, high, altitude, cloud, bands, that, wrap, around, the, planet, at, constant, latitudes, these, circumferential, bands, have, widths, of, 50, 150, km, and, lie, about, 50, 110, km, above, the, cloud, deck, these, altitudes, are, in, the, layer, where, weather, occurs, the, troposphere, weather, does, not, occur, in, the, higher, stratosphere, or, thermosphere, in, august, 2023, the, high, altitude, clouds, of, neptune, vanished, prompting, a, study, spanning, thirty, years, of, observations, by, the, hubble, space, telescope, and, ground, based, telescopes, the, study, found, that, neptune, s, high, altitude, cloud, activity, is, bound, to, solar, cycles, and, not, to, the, planet, s, seasons, neptune, s, spectra, suggest, that, its, lower, stratosphere, is, hazy, due, to, condensation, of, products, of, ultraviolet, photolysis, of, methane, such, as, ethane, and, ethyne, the, stratosphere, is, home, to, trace, amounts, of, carbon, monoxide, and, hydrogen, cyanide, the, stratosphere, of, neptune, is, warmer, than, that, of, uranus, due, to, the, elevated, concentration, of, hydrocarbons, for, reasons, that, remain, obscure, the, planet, s, thermosphere, is, at, an, anomalously, high, temperature, of, about, 750, k, 477, c, 890, f, the, planet, is, too, far, from, the, sun, for, this, heat, to, be, generated, by, ultraviolet, radiation, one, candidate, for, a, heating, mechanism, is, atmospheric, interaction, with, ions, in, the, planet, s, magnetic, field, other, candidates, are, gravity, waves, from, the, interior, that, dissipate, in, the, atmosphere, the, thermosphere, contains, traces, of, carbon, dioxide, and, water, which, may, have, been, deposited, from, external, sources, such, as, meteorites, and, dust, neptune, s, atmosphere, is, faintly, blue, in, the, optical, spectrum, only, slightly, more, saturated, than, the, blue, of, uranus, s, atmosphere, early, renderings, of, the, two, planets, greatly, exaggerated, neptune, s, colour, contrast, to, better, reveal, the, clouds, bands, and, winds, making, it, seem, deep, blue, compared, to, uranus, s, off, white, the, two, planets, had, been, imaged, with, different, systems, making, it, hard, to, directly, compare, the, resulting, composite, images, this, was, revisited, with, the, colour, normalised, over, time, most, comprehensively, in, late, 2023, neptune, s, magnetosphere, consists, of, a, magnetic, field, that, is, strongly, tilted, relative, to, its, rotational, axis, at, 47, and, offset, of, at, least, 0, 55, radius, 13, 500, km, from, the, planet, s, physical, centre, resembling, uranus, s, magnetosphere, before, the, arrival, of, voyager, 2, to, neptune, it, was, hypothesised, that, uranus, s, sideways, rotation, caused, its, tilted, magnetosphere, in, comparing, the, magnetic, fields, of, the, two, planets, scientists, now, think, the, extreme, orientation, may, be, characteristic, of, flows, in, the, planets, interiors, this, field, may, be, generated, by, convective, fluid, motions, in, a, thin, spherical, shell, of, electrically, conducting, liquids, probably, a, combination, of, ammonia, methane, and, water, resulting, in, a, dynamo, action, the, dipole, component, of, the, magnetic, field, at, the, magnetic, equator, of, neptune, is, about, 14, microteslas, 0, 14, g, the, dipole, magnetic, moment, of, neptune, is, about, 2, 2, 10, 17, t, m, 3, 14, t, r, n, 3, where, r, n, is, the, radius, of, neptune, neptune, s, magnetic, field, has, a, complex, geometry, that, includes, relatively, large, contributions, from, non, dipolar, components, including, a, strong, quadrupole, moment, that, may, exceed, the, dipole, moment, in, strength, by, contrast, earth, jupiter, and, saturn, have, only, relatively, small, quadrupole, moments, and, their, fields, are, less, tilted, from, the, polar, axis, the, large, quadrupole, moment, of, neptune, may, be, the, result, of, an, offset, from, the, planet, s, centre, and, geometrical, constraints, of, the, field, s, dynamo, generator, measurements, by, voyager, 2, in, extreme, ultraviolet, and, radio, frequencies, revealed, that, neptune, has, faint, and, weak, but, complex, and, unique, aurorae, however, these, observations, were, limited, in, time, and, did, not, contain, infrared, subsequent, astronomers, using, the, hubble, space, telescope, have, not, glimpsed, the, aurorae, in, contrast, to, the, more, well, defined, aurorae, of, uranus, neptune, s, bow, shock, where, the, magnetosphere, begins, to, slow, the, solar, wind, occurs, at, a, distance, of, 34, 9, times, the, radius, of, the, planet, the, magnetopause, where, the, pressure, of, the, magnetosphere, counterbalances, the, solar, wind, lies, at, a, distance, of, 23, 26, 5, times, the, radius, of, neptune, the, tail, of, the, magnetosphere, extends, out, to, at, least, 72, times, the, radius, of, neptune, and, likely, much, farther, neptune, s, weather, is, characterized, by, extremely, dynamic, storm, systems, with, winds, reaching, speeds, of, almost, 600, m, s, 2, 200, km, h, 1, 300, mph, exceeding, supersonic, flow, more, typically, by, tracking, the, motion, of, persistent, clouds, wind, speeds, have, been, shown, to, vary, from, 20, m, s, in, the, easterly, direction, to, 325, m, s, westward, at, the, cloud, tops, the, prevailing, winds, range, in, speed, from, 400, m, s, along, the, equator, to, 250, m, s, at, the, poles, most, of, the, winds, on, neptune, move, in, a, direction, opposite, the, planet, s, rotation, the, general, pattern, of, winds, showed, prograde, rotation, at, high, latitudes, vs, retrograde, rotation, at, lower, latitudes, the, difference, in, flow, direction, is, thought, to, be, a, skin, effect, and, not, due, to, any, deeper, atmospheric, processes, at, 70, s, latitude, a, high, speed, jet, travels, at, a, speed, of, 300, m, s, due, to, seasonal, changes, the, cloud, bands, in, the, southern, hemisphere, of, neptune, have, been, observed, to, increase, in, size, and, albedo, this, trend, was, first, seen, in, 1980, the, long, orbital, period, of, neptune, results, in, seasons, lasting, 40, earth, years, neptune, differs, from, uranus, in, its, typical, level, of, meteorological, activity, voyager, 2, observed, weather, phenomena, on, neptune, during, its, 1989, flyby, but, no, comparable, phenomena, on, uranus, during, its, 1986, flyby, the, abundance, of, methane, ethane, and, acetylene, at, neptune, s, equator, is, 10, 100, times, greater, than, at, the, poles, this, is, interpreted, as, evidence, for, upwelling, at, the, equator, and, subsidence, near, the, poles, as, photochemistry, cannot, account, for, the, distribution, without, meridional, circulation, in, 2007, it, was, discovered, that, the, upper, troposphere, of, neptune, s, south, pole, was, about, 10, k, warmer, than, the, rest, of, its, atmosphere, which, averages, about, 73, k, 200, c, the, temperature, differential, is, enough, to, let, methane, which, elsewhere, is, frozen, in, the, troposphere, escape, into, the, stratosphere, near, the, pole, the, relative, hot, spot, is, due, to, neptune, s, axial, tilt, which, has, exposed, the, south, pole, to, the, sun, for, the, last, quarter, of, neptune, s, year, or, roughly, 40, earth, years, as, neptune, slowly, moves, towards, the, opposite, side, of, the, sun, the, south, pole, will, be, darkened, and, the, north, pole, illuminated, causing, the, methane, release, to, shift, to, the, north, pole, in, 1989, the, great, dark, spot, an, anticyclonic, storm, system, spanning, 13, 000, km, 6, 600, km, 8, 100, mi, 4, 100, mi, was, discovered, by, nasa, s, voyager, 2, spacecraft, the, storm, resembled, the, great, red, spot, of, jupiter, some, five, years, later, on, 2, november, 1994, the, hubble, space, telescope, did, not, see, the, great, dark, spot, on, the, planet, instead, a, new, storm, similar, to, the, great, dark, spot, was, found, in, neptune, s, northern, hemisphere, the, scooter, is, another, storm, a, white, cloud, group, farther, south, than, the, great, dark, spot, this, nickname, first, arose, during, the, months, leading, up, to, the, voyager, 2, encounter, in, 1989, when, they, were, observed, moving, at, speeds, faster, than, the, great, dark, spot, and, images, acquired, later, would, subsequently, reveal, the, presence, of, clouds, moving, even, faster, than, those, that, had, initially, been, detected, by, voyager, 2, the, small, dark, spot, is, a, southern, cyclonic, storm, the, second, most, intense, storm, observed, during, the, 1989, encounter, it, was, initially, completely, dark, but, as, voyager, 2, approached, the, planet, a, bright, core, developed, which, can, be, seen, in, most, of, the, highest, resolution, images, in, 2018, a, newer, main, dark, spot, and, smaller, dark, spot, were, identified, and, studied, in, 2023, the, first, ground, based, observation, of, a, dark, spot, on, neptune, was, announced, neptune, s, dark, spots, are, thought, to, occur, in, the, troposphere, at, lower, altitudes, than, the, brighter, cloud, features, so, they, appear, as, holes, in, the, upper, cloud, decks, as, they, are, stable, features, that, can, persist, for, several, months, they, are, thought, to, be, vortex, structures, often, associated, with, dark, spots, are, brighter, persistent, methane, clouds, that, form, around, the, tropopause, layer, the, persistence, of, companion, clouds, shows, that, some, former, dark, spots, may, continue, to, exist, as, cyclones, even, though, they, are, no, longer, visible, as, a, dark, feature, dark, spots, may, dissipate, when, they, migrate, too, close, to, the, equator, or, possibly, through, some, other, unknown, mechanism, in, 1989, voyager, 2, s, planetary, radio, astronomy, pra, experiment, observed, around, 60, lightning, flashes, or, neptunian, electrostatic, discharges, emitting, energies, over, 7, 10, 8, j, a, plasma, wave, system, pws, detected, 16, electromagnetic, wave, events, with, a, frequency, range, of, 50, 12, khz, at, magnetic, latitudes, 7, 33, these, plasma, wave, detections, were, possibly, triggered, by, lightning, over, 20, minutes, in, the, ammonia, clouds, of, the, magnetosphere, during, voyager, 2, s, closest, approach, to, neptune, the, pws, instrument, provided, neptune, s, first, plasma, wave, detections, at, a, sample, rate, of, 28, 800, samples, per, second, the, measured, plasma, densities, range, from, 10, 3, 10, 1, cm, 3, neptunian, lightning, may, occur, in, three, cloud, layers, with, microphysical, modelling, suggesting, that, most, of, these, occurrences, happen, in, the, water, clouds, of, the, troposphere, or, the, shallow, ammonia, clouds, of, the, magnetosphere, neptune, is, predicted, to, have, 1, 19, the, lightning, flash, rate, of, jupiter, and, to, display, most, of, its, lightning, activity, at, high, latitudes, however, lightning, on, neptune, seems, to, resemble, lightning, on, earth, rather, than, jovian, lightning, neptune, s, more, varied, weather, when, compared, to, uranus, is, due, in, part, to, its, higher, internal, heating, the, upper, regions, of, neptune, s, troposphere, reach, a, low, temperature, of, 51, 8, k, 221, 3, c, at, a, depth, where, the, atmospheric, pressure, equals, 1, bar, 100, kpa, the, temperature, is, 72, 00, k, 201, 15, c, deeper, inside, the, layers, of, gas, the, temperature, rises, steadily, as, with, uranus, the, source, of, this, heating, is, unknown, but, the, discrepancy, is, larger, uranus, only, radiates, 1, 1, times, as, much, energy, as, it, receives, from, the, sun, whereas, neptune, radiates, about, 2, 61, times, as, much, energy, as, it, receives, from, the, sun, neptune, is, over, 50, farther, from, the, sun, than, uranus, and, receives, only, 40, of, uranus, s, amount, of, sunlight, however, its, internal, energy, is, still, enough, for, the, fastest, planetary, winds, in, the, solar, system, depending, on, the, thermal, properties, of, its, interior, the, heat, left, over, from, neptune, s, formation, may, be, sufficient, to, explain, its, current, heat, flow, though, it, is, harder, to, explain, uranus, s, lack, of, internal, heat, while, preserving, the, apparent, similarity, between, the, two, planets, the, average, distance, between, neptune, and, the, sun, is, 4, 5, billion, km, about, 30, 1, astronomical, units, au, the, mean, distance, from, the, earth, to, the, sun, and, it, completes, an, orbit, on, average, every, 164, 79, years, subject, to, a, variability, of, around, 0, 1, years, the, perihelion, distance, is, 29, 81, au, and, the, aphelion, distance, is, 30, 33, au, neptune, s, orbital, eccentricity, is, only, 0, 008678, making, it, the, planet, in, the, solar, system, with, the, second, most, circular, orbit, after, venus, the, orbit, of, neptune, is, inclined, 1, 77, compared, to, that, of, earth, on, 11, july, 2011, neptune, completed, its, first, full, barycentric, orbit, since, its, discovery, in, 1846, it, did, not, appear, at, its, exact, discovery, position, in, the, sky, because, earth, was, in, a, different, location, in, its, 365, 26, day, orbit, because, of, the, motion, of, the, sun, in, relation, to, the, barycentre, of, the, solar, system, on, 11, july, neptune, was, not, at, its, exact, discovery, position, in, relation, to, the, sun, if, the, more, common, heliocentric, coordinate, system, is, used, the, discovery, longitude, was, reached, on, 12, july, 2011, the, axial, tilt, of, neptune, is, 28, 32, which, is, similar, to, the, tilts, of, earth, 23, and, mars, 25, as, a, result, neptune, experiences, seasonal, changes, similar, to, those, on, earth, the, long, orbital, period, of, neptune, means, that, the, seasons, last, for, forty, earth, years, its, sidereal, rotation, period, day, is, roughly, 16, 11, hours, because, its, axial, tilt, is, comparable, to, earth, s, the, variation, in, the, length, of, its, day, over, the, course, of, its, long, year, is, not, any, more, extreme, because, neptune, is, not, a, solid, body, its, atmosphere, undergoes, differential, rotation, the, wide, equatorial, zone, rotates, with, a, period, of, about, 18, hours, which, is, slower, than, the, 16, 1, hour, rotation, of, the, planet, s, magnetic, field, by, contrast, the, reverse, is, true, for, the, polar, regions, where, the, rotation, period, is, 12, hours, this, differential, rotation, is, the, most, pronounced, of, any, planet, in, the, solar, system, and, it, results, in, strong, latitudinal, wind, shear, the, formation, of, the, ice, giants, neptune, and, uranus, has, been, difficult, to, model, precisely, current, models, suggest, that, the, matter, density, in, the, outer, regions, of, the, solar, system, was, too, low, to, account, for, the, formation, of, such, large, bodies, from, the, traditionally, accepted, method, of, core, accretion, and, various, hypotheses, have, been, advanced, to, explain, their, formation, one, is, that, the, ice, giants, were, not, formed, by, core, accretion, but, from, instabilities, within, the, original, protoplanetary, disc, and, later, had, their, atmospheres, blasted, away, by, radiation, from, a, nearby, massive, ob, star, an, alternative, concept, is, that, they, formed, closer, to, the, sun, where, the, matter, density, was, higher, and, then, subsequently, migrated, to, their, current, orbits, after, the, removal, of, the, gaseous, protoplanetary, disc, this, hypothesis, of, migration, after, formation, is, favoured, due, to, its, ability, to, better, explain, the, occupancy, of, the, populations, of, small, objects, observed, in, the, trans, neptunian, region, the, current, most, widely, accepted, explanation, of, the, details, of, this, hypothesis, is, known, as, the, nice, model, which, is, a, dynamical, evolution, scenario, that, explores, the, potential, effect, of, a, migrating, neptune, and, the, other, giant, planets, on, the, structure, of, the, kuiper, belt, neptune, s, orbit, has, a, profound, impact, on, the, region, directly, beyond, it, known, as, the, kuiper, belt, the, kuiper, belt, is, a, ring, of, small, icy, worlds, similar, to, the, asteroid, belt, but, far, larger, extending, from, neptune, s, orbit, at, 30, au, out, to, about, 55, au, from, the, sun, much, in, the, same, way, that, jupiter, s, gravity, dominates, the, asteroid, belt, neptune, s, gravity, dominates, the, kuiper, belt, over, the, age, of, the, solar, system, certain, regions, of, the, kuiper, belt, became, destabilised, by, neptune, s, gravity, creating, gaps, in, its, structure, the, region, between, 40, and, 42, au, is, an, example, there, do, exist, orbits, within, these, empty, regions, where, objects, can, survive, for, the, age, of, the, solar, system, these, resonances, occur, when, neptune, s, orbital, period, is, a, precise, fraction, of, that, of, the, object, such, as, 1, 2, or, 3, 4, if, say, an, object, orbits, the, sun, once, for, every, two, neptune, orbits, it, will, only, complete, half, an, orbit, by, the, time, neptune, returns, to, its, original, position, the, most, heavily, populated, resonance, in, the, kuiper, belt, with, over, 200, known, objects, is, the, 2, 3, resonance, objects, in, this, resonance, complete, 2, orbits, for, every, 3, of, neptune, and, are, known, as, plutinos, because, the, largest, of, the, known, kuiper, belt, objects, pluto, is, among, them, although, pluto, crosses, neptune, s, orbit, regularly, the, 2, 3, resonance, makes, it, so, that, they, can, never, collide, the, 3, 4, 3, 5, 4, 7, and, 2, 5, resonances, are, less, populated, neptune, has, a, number, of, known, trojan, objects, occupying, both, the, sun, neptune, l, 4, and, l, 5, lagrangian, points, gravitationally, stable, regions, leading, and, trailing, neptune, in, its, orbit, respectively, neptune, trojans, can, be, viewed, as, being, in, a, 1, 1, resonance, with, neptune, some, neptune, trojans, are, remarkably, stable, in, their, orbits, and, are, likely, to, have, formed, alongside, neptune, rather, than, being, captured, the, first, object, identified, as, associated, with, neptune, s, trailing, l, 5, lagrangian, point, was, 2008, lc, 18, neptune, has, a, temporary, quasi, satellite, 309239, 2007, rw, 10, the, object, has, been, a, quasi, satellite, of, neptune, for, about, 12, 500, years, and, it, will, remain, in, that, dynamical, state, for, another, 12, 500, years, neptune, has, 16, known, moons, triton, is, the, largest, neptunian, moon, accounting, for, more, than, 99, 5, of, the, mass, in, orbit, around, neptune, and, is, the, only, one, massive, enough, to, be, spheroidal, triton, was, discovered, by, william, lassell, just, 17, days, after, the, discovery, of, neptune, itself, unlike, all, other, large, planetary, moons, in, the, solar, system, triton, has, a, retrograde, orbit, indicating, that, it, was, captured, rather, than, forming, in, place, it, was, probably, once, a, dwarf, planet, in, the, kuiper, belt, it, is, close, enough, to, neptune, to, be, locked, into, a, synchronous, rotation, and, it, is, slowly, spiralling, inward, because, of, tidal, acceleration, it, will, eventually, be, torn, apart, in, about, 3, 6, billion, years, when, it, reaches, the, roche, limit, in, 1989, triton, was, the, coldest, object, that, had, yet, been, measured, in, the, solar, system, with, estimated, temperatures, of, 38, k, 235, c, this, very, low, temperature, is, due, to, triton, s, very, high, albedo, which, causes, it, to, reflect, a, lot, of, sunlight, instead, of, absorbing, it, neptune, s, second, known, satellite, by, order, of, discovery, the, irregular, moon, nereid, has, one, of, the, most, eccentric, orbits, of, any, satellite, in, the, solar, system, the, eccentricity, of, 0, 7512, gives, it, an, apoapsis, that, is, seven, times, its, periapsis, distance, from, neptune, from, july, to, september, 1989, voyager, 2, discovered, six, moons, of, neptune, of, these, the, irregularly, shaped, proteus, is, notable, for, being, as, large, as, a, body, of, its, density, can, be, without, being, pulled, into, a, spherical, shape, by, its, own, gravity, although, the, second, most, massive, neptunian, moon, it, is, only, 0, 25, the, mass, of, triton, neptune, s, innermost, four, moons, naiad, thalassa, despina, and, galatea, orbit, close, enough, to, be, within, neptune, s, rings, the, next, farthest, out, larissa, was, originally, discovered, in, 1981, when, it, had, occulted, a, star, this, occultation, had, been, attributed, to, ring, arcs, but, when, voyager, 2, observed, neptune, in, 1989, larissa, was, found, to, have, caused, it, five, new, irregular, moons, discovered, between, 2002, and, 2003, were, announced, in, 2004, a, new, moon, and, the, smallest, yet, hippocamp, was, found, in, 2013, by, combining, multiple, hubble, images, because, neptune, was, the, roman, god, of, the, sea, neptune, s, moons, have, been, named, after, lesser, sea, gods, neptune, has, a, planetary, ring, system, though, one, much, less, substantial, than, that, of, saturn, and, uranus, the, rings, may, consist, of, ice, particles, coated, with, silicates, or, carbon, based, material, which, most, likely, gives, them, a, reddish, hue, the, three, main, rings, are, the, narrow, adams, ring, 63, 000, km, from, the, centre, of, neptune, the, le, verrier, ring, at, 53, 000, km, and, the, broader, fainter, galle, ring, at, 42, 000, km, a, faint, outward, extension, to, the, le, verrier, ring, has, been, named, lassell, it, is, bounded, at, its, outer, edge, by, the, arago, ring, at, 57, 000, km, the, first, of, these, planetary, rings, was, detected, in, 1968, by, a, team, led, by, edward, guinan, in, the, early, 1980s, analysis, of, this, data, along, with, newer, observations, led, to, the, hypothesis, that, this, ring, might, be, incomplete, evidence, that, the, rings, might, have, gaps, first, arose, during, a, stellar, occultation, in, 1984, when, the, rings, obscured, a, star, on, immersion, but, not, on, emersion, images, from, voyager, 2, in, 1989, settled, the, issue, by, showing, several, faint, rings, the, outermost, ring, adams, contains, five, prominent, arcs, now, named, courage, libert, egalit, 1, egalit, 2, and, fraternit, courage, liberty, equality, and, fraternity, the, existence, of, arcs, was, difficult, to, explain, because, the, laws, of, motion, would, predict, that, arcs, would, spread, out, into, a, uniform, ring, over, short, timescales, astronomers, now, estimate, that, the, arcs, are, corralled, into, their, current, form, by, the, gravitational, effects, of, galatea, a, moon, just, inward, from, the, ring, earth, based, observations, announced, in, 2005, appeared, to, show, that, neptune, s, rings, were, much, more, unstable, than, previously, thought, images, taken, from, the, w, m, keck, observatory, in, 2002, and, 2003, show, considerable, decay, in, the, rings, when, compared, to, images, by, voyager, 2, in, particular, it, seems, that, the, libert, arc, might, disappear, in, as, little, as, one, century, neptune, brightened, about, 10, between, 1980, and, 2000, mostly, due, to, the, changing, of, the, seasons, neptune, may, continue, to, brighten, as, it, approaches, perihelion, in, 2042, the, apparent, magnitude, currently, ranges, from, 7, 67, to, 7, 89, with, a, mean, of, 7, 78, and, a, standard, deviation, of, 0, 06, prior, to, 1980, the, planet, was, as, faint, as, magnitude, 8, 0, neptune, is, too, faint, to, be, visible, to, the, naked, eye, it, can, be, outshone, by, jupiter, s, galilean, moons, the, dwarf, planet, ceres, and, the, asteroids, 4, vesta, 2, pallas, 7, iris, 3, juno, and, 6, hebe, a, telescope, or, strong, binoculars, will, resolve, neptune, as, a, small, blue, disk, similar, in, appearance, to, uranus, because, of, the, distance, of, neptune, from, earth, its, angular, diameter, only, ranges, from, 2, 2, to, 2, 4, arcseconds, the, smallest, of, the, solar, system, planets, its, small, apparent, size, makes, it, challenging, to, study, visually, most, telescopic, data, was, fairly, limited, until, the, advent, of, the, hubble, space, telescope, and, large, ground, based, telescopes, with, adaptive, optics, ao, the, first, scientifically, useful, observation, of, neptune, from, ground, based, telescopes, using, adaptive, optics, was, commenced, in, 1997, from, hawaii, neptune, is, currently, approaching, perihelion, closest, approach, to, the, sun, and, has, been, shown, to, be, heating, up, with, increased, atmospheric, activity, and, brightness, as, a, consequence, combined, with, technological, advancements, ground, based, telescopes, with, adaptive, optics, are, recording, increasingly, more, detailed, images, of, it, both, hubble, and, the, adaptive, optics, telescopes, on, earth, have, made, many, new, discoveries, within, the, solar, system, since, the, mid, 1990s, with, a, large, increase, in, the, number, of, known, satellites, and, moons, around, the, outer, planet, among, others, in, 2004, and, 2005, five, new, small, satellites, of, neptune, with, diameters, between, 38, and, 61, kilometres, were, discovered, from, earth, neptune, goes, through, apparent, retrograde, motion, every, 367, days, resulting, in, a, looping, motion, against, the, background, stars, during, each, opposition, these, loops, carried, it, close, to, the, 1846, discovery, coordinates, in, april, and, july, 2010, and, again, in, october, and, november, 2011, neptune, s, 164, year, orbital, period, means, that, the, planet, takes, an, average, of, 13, years, to, move, through, each, constellation, of, the, zodiac, in, 2011, it, completed, its, first, full, orbit, of, the, sun, since, being, discovered, and, returned, to, where, it, was, first, spotted, northeast, of, iota, aquarii, observation, of, neptune, in, the, radio, frequency, band, shows, that, it, is, a, source, of, both, continuous, emission, and, irregular, bursts, both, sources, are, thought, to, originate, from, its, rotating, magnetic, field, in, the, infrared, part, of, the, spectrum, neptune, s, storms, appear, bright, against, the, cooler, background, allowing, the, size, and, shape, of, these, features, to, be, readily, tracked, voyager, 2, is, the, only, spacecraft, that, has, visited, neptune, the, spacecraft, s, closest, approach, to, the, planet, occurred, on, 25, august, 1989, because, this, was, the, last, major, planet, the, spacecraft, could, visit, it, was, decided, to, make, a, close, flyby, of, the, moon, triton, regardless, of, the, consequences, to, the, trajectory, similarly, to, what, was, done, for, voyager, 1, s, encounter, with, saturn, and, its, moon, titan, the, images, relayed, back, to, earth, from, voyager, 2, became, the, basis, of, a, 1989, pbs, all, night, program, neptune, all, night, during, the, encounter, signals, from, the, spacecraft, required, 246, minutes, to, reach, earth, hence, for, the, most, part, voyager, 2, s, mission, relied, on, preloaded, commands, for, the, neptune, encounter, the, spacecraft, performed, a, near, encounter, with, the, moon, nereid, before, it, came, within, 4, 400, km, of, neptune, s, atmosphere, on, 25, august, then, passed, close, to, the, planet, s, largest, moon, triton, later, the, same, day, the, spacecraft, verified, the, existence, of, a, magnetic, field, surrounding, the, planet, and, discovered, that, the, field, was, offset, from, the, centre, and, tilted, in, a, manner, similar, to, the, field, around, uranus, neptune, s, rotation, period, was, determined, using, measurements, of, radio, emissions, and, voyager, 2, showed, that, neptune, had, a, surprisingly, active, weather, system, six, new, moons, were, discovered, and, the, planet, was, shown, to, have, more, than, one, ring, the, flyby, provided, the, first, accurate, measurement, of, neptune, s, mass, which, was, found, to, be, 0, 5, per, cent, less, than, previously, calculated, the, new, figure, disproved, the, hypothesis, that, an, undiscovered, planet, x, acted, upon, the, orbits, of, neptune, and, uranus, since, 2018, the, china, national, space, administration, has, been, studying, a, concept, for, a, pair, of, voyager, like, interstellar, probes, tentatively, known, as, shensuo, both, probes, would, be, launched, in, the, 2020s, and, take, differing, paths, to, explore, opposing, ends, of, the, heliosphere, the, second, probe, ihp, 2, would, fly, by, neptune, in, january, 2038, passing, only, 1, 000, km, above, the, cloud, tops, and, potentially, carry, an, atmospheric, impactor, to, be, released, during, its, approach, afterward, it, will, continue, its, mission, throughout, the, kuiper, belt, toward, the, heliosphere, tail, which, is, so, far, unexplored, after, voyager, 2, and, ihp, 2, s, flybys, the, next, step, in, scientific, exploration, of, the, neptunian, system, is, considered, to, be, an, orbital, mission, most, proposals, have, been, by, nasa, most, often, for, a, flagship, orbiter, in, 2003, there, was, a, proposal, in, nasa, s, vision, missions, studies, for, a, neptune, orbiter, with, probes, mission, that, does, cassini, level, science, a, subsequent, proposal, that, was, not, selected, was, for, argo, a, flyby, spacecraft, to, be, launched, in, 2019, that, would, visit, jupiter, saturn, neptune, and, a, kuiper, belt, object, the, focus, would, have, been, on, neptune, and, its, largest, moon, triton, to, be, investigated, around, 2029, the, proposed, new, horizons, 2, mission, might, have, done, a, close, flyby, of, the, neptunian, system, but, it, was, later, scrapped, currently, a, pending, proposal, for, the, discovery, program, the, trident, spacecraft, would, conduct, a, flyby, of, neptune, and, triton, however, the, mission, was, not, selected, for, discovery, 15, or, 16, neptune, odyssey, is, another, concept, for, a, neptune, orbiter, and, atmospheric, probe, that, was, studied, as, a, possible, large, strategic, science, mission, by, nasa, it, would, have, launched, between, 2031, and, 2033, and, arrive, at, neptune, by, 2049, however, for, logistical, reasons, the, uranus, orbiter, and, probe, mission, was, selected, as, the, ice, giant, orbiter, mission, recommendation, with, top, priority, ahead, of, the, enceladus, orbilander, two, notable, proposals, for, a, triton, focused, neptune, orbiter, mission, that, would, be, costed, right, between, the, trident, and, odyssey, missions, under, the, new, frontiers, program, are, triton, ocean, world, surveyor, and, nautilus, with, cruise, stages, taking, place, in, the, 2031, 47, and, 2041, 56, time, periods, respectively, neptune, is, a, potential, target, for, china, s, tianwen, 5, which, could, arrive, in, 2058, solar, system,
