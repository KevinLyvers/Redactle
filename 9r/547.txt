earth, science, or, geoscience, includes, all, fields, of, natural, science, related, to, the, planet, earth, this, is, a, branch, of, science, dealing, with, the, physical, chemical, and, biological, complex, constitutions, and, synergistic, linkages, of, earth, s, four, spheres, the, biosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, atmosphere, and, geosphere, or, lithosphere, earth, science, can, be, considered, to, be, a, branch, of, planetary, science, but, with, a, much, older, history, geology, is, broadly, the, study, of, earth, s, structure, substance, and, processes, geology, is, largely, the, study, of, the, lithosphere, or, earth, s, surface, including, the, crust, and, rocks, it, includes, the, physical, characteristics, and, processes, that, occur, in, the, lithosphere, as, well, as, how, they, are, affected, by, geothermal, energy, it, incorporates, aspects, of, chemistry, physics, and, biology, as, elements, of, geology, interact, historical, geology, is, the, application, of, geology, to, interpret, earth, history, and, how, it, has, changed, over, time, geochemistry, studies, the, chemical, components, and, processes, of, the, earth, geophysics, studies, the, physical, properties, of, the, earth, paleontology, studies, fossilized, biological, material, in, the, lithosphere, planetary, geology, studies, geoscience, as, it, pertains, to, extraterrestrial, bodies, geomorphology, studies, the, origin, of, landscapes, structural, geology, studies, the, deformation, of, rocks, to, produce, mountains, and, lowlands, resource, geology, studies, how, energy, resources, can, be, obtained, from, minerals, environmental, geology, studies, how, pollution, and, contaminants, affect, soil, and, rock, mineralogy, is, the, study, of, minerals, and, includes, the, study, of, mineral, formation, crystal, structure, hazards, associated, with, minerals, and, the, physical, and, chemical, properties, of, minerals, petrology, is, the, study, of, rocks, including, the, formation, and, composition, of, rocks, petrography, is, a, branch, of, petrology, that, studies, the, typology, and, classification, of, rocks, plate, tectonics, mountain, ranges, volcanoes, and, earthquakes, are, geological, phenomena, that, can, be, explained, in, terms, of, physical, and, chemical, processes, in, the, earth, s, crust, beneath, the, earth, s, crust, lies, the, mantle, which, is, heated, by, the, radioactive, decay, of, heavy, elements, the, mantle, is, not, quite, solid, and, consists, of, magma, which, is, in, a, state, of, semi, perpetual, convection, this, convection, process, causes, the, lithospheric, plates, to, move, albeit, slowly, the, resulting, process, is, known, as, plate, tectonics, areas, of, the, crust, where, new, crust, is, created, are, called, divergent, boundaries, those, where, it, is, brought, back, into, the, earth, are, convergent, boundaries, and, those, where, plates, slide, past, each, other, but, no, new, lithospheric, material, is, created, or, destroyed, are, referred, to, as, transform, or, conservative, boundaries, earthquakes, result, from, the, movement, of, the, lithospheric, plates, and, they, often, occur, near, convergent, boundaries, where, parts, of, the, crust, are, forced, into, the, earth, as, part, of, subduction, plate, tectonics, might, be, thought, of, as, the, process, by, which, the, earth, is, resurfaced, as, the, result, of, seafloor, spreading, new, crust, and, lithosphere, is, created, by, the, flow, of, magma, from, the, mantle, to, the, near, surface, through, fissures, where, it, cools, and, solidifies, through, subduction, oceanic, crust, and, lithosphere, vehemently, returns, to, the, convecting, mantle, volcanoes, result, primarily, from, the, melting, of, subducted, crust, material, crust, material, that, is, forced, into, the, asthenosphere, melts, and, some, portion, of, the, melted, material, becomes, light, enough, to, rise, to, the, surface, giving, birth, to, volcanoes, atmospheric, science, initially, developed, in, the, late, 19th, century, as, a, means, to, forecast, the, weather, through, meteorology, the, study, of, weather, atmospheric, chemistry, was, developed, in, the, 20th, century, to, measure, air, pollution, and, expanded, in, the, 1970s, in, response, to, acid, rain, climatology, studies, the, climate, and, climate, change, the, troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, and, exosphere, are, the, five, layers, which, make, up, earth, s, atmosphere, 75, of, the, mass, in, the, atmosphere, is, located, within, the, troposphere, the, lowest, layer, in, all, the, atmosphere, is, made, up, of, about, 78, 0, nitrogen, 20, 9, oxygen, and, 0, 92, argon, and, small, amounts, of, other, gases, including, co, 2, and, water, vapor, water, vapor, and, co, 2, cause, the, earth, s, atmosphere, to, catch, and, hold, the, sun, s, energy, through, the, greenhouse, effect, this, makes, earth, s, surface, warm, enough, for, liquid, water, and, life, in, addition, to, trapping, heat, the, atmosphere, also, protects, living, organisms, by, shielding, the, earth, s, surface, from, cosmic, rays, the, magnetic, field, created, by, the, internal, motions, of, the, core, produces, the, magnetosphere, which, protects, earth, s, atmosphere, from, the, solar, wind, as, the, earth, is, 4, 5, billion, years, old, it, would, have, lost, its, atmosphere, by, now, if, there, were, no, protective, magnetosphere, earth, s, magnetic, field, also, known, as, the, geomagnetic, field, is, the, magnetic, field, that, extends, from, earth, s, interior, out, into, space, where, it, interacts, with, the, solar, wind, a, stream, of, charged, particles, emanating, from, the, sun, the, magnetic, field, is, generated, by, electric, currents, due, to, the, motion, of, convection, currents, of, a, mixture, of, molten, iron, and, nickel, in, earth, s, outer, core, these, convection, currents, are, caused, by, heat, escaping, from, the, core, a, natural, process, called, a, geodynamo, the, magnitude, of, earth, s, magnetic, field, at, its, surface, ranges, from, 25, to, 65, t, 0, 25, to, 0, 65, g, as, an, approximation, it, is, represented, by, a, field, of, a, magnetic, dipole, currently, tilted, at, an, angle, of, about, 11, with, respect, to, earth, s, rotational, axis, as, if, there, were, an, enormous, bar, magnet, placed, at, that, angle, through, the, center, of, earth, the, north, geomagnetic, pole, actually, represents, the, south, pole, of, earth, s, magnetic, field, and, conversely, the, south, geomagnetic, pole, corresponds, to, the, north, pole, of, earth, s, magnetic, field, because, opposite, magnetic, poles, attract, and, the, north, end, of, a, magnet, like, a, compass, needle, points, toward, earth, s, south, magnetic, field, ellesmere, island, nunavut, canada, hydrology, is, the, study, of, the, hydrosphere, and, the, movement, of, water, on, earth, it, emphasizes, the, study, of, how, humans, use, and, interact, with, freshwater, supplies, study, of, water, s, movement, is, closely, related, to, geomorphology, and, other, branches, of, earth, science, applied, hydrology, involves, engineering, to, maintain, aquatic, environments, and, distribute, water, supplies, subdisciplines, of, hydrology, include, oceanography, hydrogeology, ecohydrology, and, glaciology, oceanography, is, the, study, of, oceans, hydrogeology, is, the, study, of, groundwater, it, includes, the, mapping, of, groundwater, supplies, and, the, analysis, of, groundwater, contaminants, applied, hydrogeology, seeks, to, prevent, contamination, of, groundwater, and, mineral, springs, and, make, it, available, as, drinking, water, the, earliest, exploitation, of, groundwater, resources, dates, back, to, 3000, bc, and, hydrogeology, as, a, science, was, developed, by, hydrologists, beginning, in, the, 17th, century, ecohydrology, is, the, study, of, ecological, systems, in, the, hydrosphere, it, can, be, divided, into, the, physical, study, of, aquatic, ecosystems, and, the, biological, study, of, aquatic, organisms, ecohydrology, includes, the, effects, that, organisms, and, aquatic, ecosystems, have, on, one, another, as, well, as, how, these, ecoystems, are, affected, by, humans, glaciology, is, the, study, of, the, cryosphere, including, glaciers, and, coverage, of, the, earth, by, ice, and, snow, concerns, of, glaciology, include, access, to, glacial, freshwater, mitigation, of, glacial, hazards, obtaining, resources, that, exist, beneath, frozen, land, and, addressing, the, effects, of, climate, change, on, the, cryosphere, ecology, is, the, study, of, the, biosphere, this, includes, the, study, of, nature, and, of, how, living, things, interact, with, the, earth, and, one, another, and, the, consequences, of, that, it, considers, how, living, things, use, resources, such, as, oxygen, water, and, nutrients, from, the, earth, to, sustain, themselves, it, also, considers, how, humans, and, other, living, creatures, cause, changes, to, nature, physical, geography, is, the, study, of, earth, s, systems, and, how, they, interact, with, one, another, as, part, of, a, single, self, contained, system, it, incorporates, astronomy, mathematical, geography, meteorology, climatology, geology, geomorphology, biology, biogeography, pedology, and, soils, geography, physical, geography, is, distinct, from, human, geography, which, studies, the, human, populations, on, earth, though, it, does, include, human, effects, on, the, environment, methodologies, vary, depending, on, the, nature, of, the, subjects, being, studied, studies, typically, fall, into, one, of, three, categories, observational, experimental, or, theoretical, earth, scientists, often, conduct, sophisticated, computer, analysis, or, visit, an, interesting, location, to, study, earth, phenomena, e, g, antarctica, or, hot, spot, island, chains, a, foundational, idea, in, earth, science, is, the, notion, of, uniformitarianism, which, states, that, ancient, geologic, features, are, interpreted, by, understanding, active, processes, that, are, readily, observed, in, other, words, any, geologic, processes, at, work, in, the, present, have, operated, in, the, same, ways, throughout, geologic, time, this, enables, those, who, study, earth, history, to, apply, knowledge, of, how, the, earth, s, processes, operate, in, the, present, to, gain, insight, into, how, the, planet, has, evolved, and, changed, throughout, long, history, in, earth, science, it, is, common, to, conceptualize, the, earth, s, surface, as, consisting, of, several, distinct, layers, often, referred, to, as, spheres, the, lithosphere, the, hydrosphere, the, atmosphere, and, the, biosphere, this, concept, of, spheres, is, a, useful, tool, for, understanding, the, earth, s, surface, and, its, various, processes, these, correspond, to, rocks, water, air, and, life, also, included, by, some, are, the, cryosphere, corresponding, to, ice, as, a, distinct, portion, of, the, hydrosphere, and, the, pedosphere, corresponding, to, soil, as, an, active, and, intermixed, sphere, the, following, fields, of, science, are, generally, categorized, within, the, earth, sciences
