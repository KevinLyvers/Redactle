statics, is, the, branch, of, classical, mechanics, that, is, concerned, with, the, analysis, of, force, and, torque, acting, on, a, physical, system, that, does, not, experience, an, acceleration, but, rather, is, in, equilibrium, with, its, environment, if, f, displaystyle, textbf, f, is, the, total, of, the, forces, acting, on, the, system, m, displaystyle, m, is, the, mass, of, the, system, and, a, displaystyle, textbf, a, is, the, acceleration, of, the, system, newton, s, second, law, states, that, f, m, a, displaystyle, textbf, f, m, textbf, a, the, bold, font, indicates, a, vector, quantity, i, e, one, with, both, magnitude, and, direction, if, a, 0, displaystyle, textbf, a, 0, then, f, 0, displaystyle, textbf, f, 0, as, for, a, system, in, static, equilibrium, the, acceleration, equals, zero, the, system, is, either, at, rest, or, its, center, of, mass, moves, at, constant, velocity, the, application, of, the, assumption, of, zero, acceleration, to, the, summation, of, moments, acting, on, the, system, leads, to, m, i, 0, displaystyle, textbf, m, i, alpha, 0, where, m, displaystyle, textbf, m, is, the, summation, of, all, moments, acting, on, the, system, i, displaystyle, i, is, the, moment, of, inertia, of, the, mass, and, displaystyle, alpha, is, the, angular, acceleration, of, the, system, for, a, system, where, 0, displaystyle, alpha, 0, it, is, also, true, that, m, 0, displaystyle, textbf, m, 0, together, the, equations, f, m, a, 0, displaystyle, textbf, f, m, textbf, a, 0, the, first, condition, for, equilibrium, and, m, i, 0, displaystyle, textbf, m, i, alpha, 0, the, second, condition, for, equilibrium, can, be, used, to, solve, for, unknown, quantities, acting, on, the, system, archimedes, c, 287, c, 212, bc, did, pioneering, work, in, statics, later, developments, in, the, field, of, statics, are, found, in, works, of, thebit, force, is, the, action, of, one, body, on, another, a, force, is, either, a, push, or, a, pull, and, it, tends, to, move, a, body, in, the, direction, of, its, action, the, action, of, a, force, is, characterized, by, its, magnitude, by, the, direction, of, its, action, and, by, its, point, of, application, or, point, of, contact, thus, force, is, a, vector, quantity, because, its, effect, depends, on, the, direction, as, well, as, on, the, magnitude, of, the, action, forces, are, classified, as, either, contact, or, body, forces, a, contact, force, is, produced, by, direct, physical, contact, an, example, is, the, force, exerted, on, a, body, by, a, supporting, surface, a, body, force, is, generated, by, virtue, of, the, position, of, a, body, within, a, force, field, such, as, a, gravitational, electric, or, magnetic, field, and, is, independent, of, contact, with, any, other, body, an, example, of, a, body, force, is, the, weight, of, a, body, in, the, earth, s, gravitational, field, in, addition, to, the, tendency, to, move, a, body, in, the, direction, of, its, application, a, force, can, also, tend, to, rotate, a, body, about, an, axis, the, axis, may, be, any, line, which, neither, intersects, nor, is, parallel, to, the, line, of, action, of, the, force, this, rotational, tendency, is, known, as, moment, of, force, m, moment, is, also, referred, to, as, torque, the, magnitude, of, the, moment, of, a, force, at, a, point, o, is, equal, to, the, perpendicular, distance, from, o, to, the, line, of, action, of, f, multiplied, by, the, magnitude, of, the, force, m, f, d, where, the, direction, of, the, moment, is, given, by, the, right, hand, rule, where, counter, clockwise, ccw, is, out, of, the, page, and, clockwise, cw, is, into, the, page, the, moment, direction, may, be, accounted, for, by, using, a, stated, sign, convention, such, as, a, plus, sign, for, counterclockwise, moments, and, a, minus, sign, for, clockwise, moments, or, vice, versa, moments, can, be, added, together, as, vectors, in, vector, format, the, moment, can, be, defined, as, the, cross, product, between, the, radius, vector, r, the, vector, from, point, o, to, the, line, of, action, and, the, force, vector, f, varignon, s, theorem, states, that, the, moment, of, a, force, about, any, point, is, equal, to, the, sum, of, the, moments, of, the, components, of, the, force, about, the, same, point, the, static, equilibrium, of, a, particle, is, an, important, concept, in, statics, a, particle, is, in, equilibrium, only, if, the, resultant, of, all, forces, acting, on, the, particle, is, equal, to, zero, in, a, rectangular, coordinate, system, the, equilibrium, equations, can, be, represented, by, three, scalar, equations, where, the, sums, of, forces, in, all, three, directions, are, equal, to, zero, an, engineering, application, of, this, concept, is, determining, the, tensions, of, up, to, three, cables, under, load, for, example, the, forces, exerted, on, each, cable, of, a, hoist, lifting, an, object, or, of, guy, wires, restraining, a, hot, air, balloon, to, the, ground, in, classical, mechanics, moment, of, inertia, also, called, mass, moment, rotational, inertia, polar, moment, of, inertia, of, mass, or, the, angular, mass, si, units, kg, m, is, a, measure, of, an, object, s, resistance, to, changes, to, its, rotation, it, is, the, inertia, of, a, rotating, body, with, respect, to, its, rotation, the, moment, of, inertia, plays, much, the, same, role, in, rotational, dynamics, as, mass, does, in, linear, dynamics, describing, the, relationship, between, angular, momentum, and, angular, velocity, torque, and, angular, acceleration, and, several, other, quantities, the, symbols, i, and, j, are, usually, used, to, refer, to, the, moment, of, inertia, or, polar, moment, of, inertia, while, a, simple, scalar, treatment, of, the, moment, of, inertia, suffices, for, many, situations, a, more, advanced, tensor, treatment, allows, the, analysis, of, such, complicated, systems, as, spinning, tops, and, gyroscopic, motion, the, concept, was, introduced, by, leonhard, euler, in, his, 1765, book, theoria, motus, corporum, solidorum, seu, rigidorum, he, discussed, the, moment, of, inertia, and, many, related, concepts, such, as, the, principal, axis, of, inertia, statics, is, used, in, the, analysis, of, structures, for, instance, in, architectural, and, structural, engineering, strength, of, materials, is, a, related, field, of, mechanics, that, relies, heavily, on, the, application, of, static, equilibrium, a, key, concept, is, the, center, of, gravity, of, a, body, at, rest, it, represents, an, imaginary, point, at, which, all, the, mass, of, a, body, resides, the, position, of, the, point, relative, to, the, foundations, on, which, a, body, lies, determines, its, stability, in, response, to, external, forces, if, the, center, of, gravity, exists, outside, the, foundations, then, the, body, is, unstable, because, there, is, a, torque, acting, any, small, disturbance, will, cause, the, body, to, fall, or, topple, if, the, center, of, gravity, exists, within, the, foundations, the, body, is, stable, since, no, net, torque, acts, on, the, body, if, the, center, of, gravity, coincides, with, the, foundations, then, the, body, is, said, to, be, metastable, hydrostatics, also, known, as, fluid, statics, is, the, study, of, fluids, at, rest, i, e, in, static, equilibrium, the, characteristic, of, any, fluid, at, rest, is, that, the, force, exerted, on, any, particle, of, the, fluid, is, the, same, at, all, points, at, the, same, depth, or, altitude, within, the, fluid, if, the, net, force, is, greater, than, zero, the, fluid, will, move, in, the, direction, of, the, resulting, force, this, concept, was, first, formulated, in, a, slightly, extended, form, by, french, mathematician, and, philosopher, blaise, pascal, in, 1647, and, became, known, as, pascal, s, law, it, has, many, important, applications, in, hydraulics, archimedes, ab, rayh, n, al, b, r, n, al, khazini, and, galileo, galilei, were, also, major, figures, in, the, development, of, hydrostatics, using, a, whole, body, of, mathematical, methods, not, only, those, inherited, from, the, antique, theory, of, ratios, and, infinitesimal, techniques, but, also, the, methods, of, the, contemporary, algebra, and, fine, calculation, techniques, arabic, scientists, raised, statics, to, a, new, higher, level, the, classical, results, of, archimedes, in, the, theory, of, the, centre, of, gravity, were, generalized, and, applied, to, three, dimensional, bodies, the, theory, of, ponderable, lever, was, founded, and, the, science, of, gravity, was, created, and, later, further, developed, in, medieval, europe, the, phenomena, of, statics, were, studied, by, using, the, dynamic, approach, so, that, two, trends, statics, and, dynamics, turned, out, to, be, inter, related, within, a, single, science, mechanics, the, combination, of, the, dynamic, approach, with, archimedean, hydrostatics, gave, birth, to, a, direction, in, science, which, may, be, called, medieval, hydrodynamics, numerous, experimental, methods, were, developed, for, determining, the, specific, weight, which, were, based, in, particular, on, the, theory, of, balances, and, weighing, the, classical, works, of, al, biruni, and, al, khazini, may, be, considered, the, beginning, of, the, application, of, experimental, methods, in, medieval, science
