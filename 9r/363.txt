argon, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, ar, and, atomic, number, 18, it, is, in, group, 18, of, the, periodic, table, and, is, a, noble, gas, argon, is, the, third, most, abundant, gas, in, earth, s, atmosphere, at, 0, 934, 9340, ppmv, it, is, more, than, twice, as, abundant, as, water, vapor, which, averages, about, 4000, ppmv, but, varies, greatly, 23, times, as, abundant, as, carbon, dioxide, 400, ppmv, and, more, than, 500, times, as, abundant, as, neon, 18, ppmv, argon, is, the, most, abundant, noble, gas, in, earth, s, crust, comprising, 0, 00015, of, the, crust, nearly, all, argon, in, earth, s, atmosphere, is, radiogenic, argon, 40, derived, from, the, decay, of, potassium, 40, in, earth, s, crust, in, the, universe, argon, 36, is, by, far, the, most, common, argon, isotope, as, it, is, the, most, easily, produced, by, stellar, nucleosynthesis, in, supernovas, the, name, argon, is, derived, from, the, greek, word, neuter, singular, form, of, meaning, lazy, or, inactive, as, a, reference, to, the, fact, that, the, element, undergoes, almost, no, chemical, reactions, the, complete, octet, eight, electrons, in, the, outer, atomic, shell, makes, argon, stable, and, resistant, to, bonding, with, other, elements, its, triple, point, temperature, of, 83, 8058, k, is, a, defining, fixed, point, in, the, international, temperature, scale, of, 1990, argon, is, extracted, industrially, by, the, fractional, distillation, of, liquid, air, it, is, mostly, used, as, an, inert, shielding, gas, in, welding, and, other, high, temperature, industrial, processes, where, ordinarily, unreactive, substances, become, reactive, for, example, an, argon, atmosphere, is, used, in, graphite, electric, furnaces, to, prevent, the, graphite, from, burning, it, is, also, used, in, incandescent, and, fluorescent, lighting, and, other, gas, discharge, tubes, it, makes, a, distinctive, blue, green, gas, laser, it, is, also, used, in, fluorescent, glow, starters, argon, has, approximately, the, same, solubility, in, water, as, oxygen, and, is, 2, 5, times, more, soluble, in, water, than, nitrogen, argon, is, colorless, odorless, nonflammable, and, nontoxic, as, a, solid, liquid, or, gas, argon, is, chemically, inert, under, most, conditions, and, forms, no, confirmed, stable, compounds, at, room, temperature, although, argon, is, a, noble, gas, it, can, form, some, compounds, under, various, extreme, conditions, argon, fluorohydride, harf, a, compound, of, argon, with, fluorine, and, hydrogen, that, is, stable, below, 17, k, 256, 1, c, 429, 1, f, has, been, demonstrated, although, the, neutral, ground, state, chemical, compounds, of, argon, are, presently, limited, to, harf, argon, can, form, clathrates, with, water, when, atoms, of, argon, are, trapped, in, a, lattice, of, water, molecules, ions, such, as, arh, and, excited, state, complexes, such, as, arf, have, been, demonstrated, theoretical, calculation, predicts, several, more, argon, compounds, that, should, be, stable, but, have, not, yet, been, synthesized, argon, greek, neuter, singular, form, of, meaning, lazy, or, inactive, is, named, in, reference, to, its, chemical, inactivity, this, chemical, property, of, this, first, noble, gas, to, be, discovered, impressed, the, namers, an, unreactive, gas, was, suspected, to, be, a, component, of, air, by, henry, cavendish, in, 1785, argon, was, first, isolated, from, air, in, 1894, by, lord, rayleigh, and, sir, william, ramsay, at, university, college, london, by, removing, oxygen, carbon, dioxide, water, and, nitrogen, from, a, sample, of, clean, air, they, first, accomplished, this, by, replicating, an, experiment, of, henry, cavendish, s, they, trapped, a, mixture, of, atmospheric, air, with, additional, oxygen, in, a, test, tube, a, upside, down, over, a, large, quantity, of, dilute, alkali, solution, b, which, in, cavendish, s, original, experiment, was, potassium, hydroxide, and, conveyed, a, current, through, wires, insulated, by, u, shaped, glass, tubes, cc, which, sealed, around, the, platinum, wire, electrodes, leaving, the, ends, of, the, wires, dd, exposed, to, the, gas, and, insulated, from, the, alkali, solution, the, arc, was, powered, by, a, battery, of, five, grove, cells, and, a, ruhmkorff, coil, of, medium, size, the, alkali, absorbed, the, oxides, of, nitrogen, produced, by, the, arc, and, also, carbon, dioxide, they, operated, the, arc, until, no, more, reduction, of, volume, of, the, gas, could, be, seen, for, at, least, an, hour, or, two, and, the, spectral, lines, of, nitrogen, disappeared, when, the, gas, was, examined, the, remaining, oxygen, was, reacted, with, alkaline, pyrogallate, to, leave, behind, an, apparently, non, reactive, gas, which, they, called, argon, before, isolating, the, gas, they, had, determined, that, nitrogen, produced, from, chemical, compounds, was, 0, 5, lighter, than, nitrogen, from, the, atmosphere, the, difference, was, slight, but, it, was, important, enough, to, attract, their, attention, for, many, months, they, concluded, that, there, was, another, gas, in, the, air, mixed, in, with, the, nitrogen, argon, was, also, encountered, in, 1882, through, independent, research, of, h, f, newall, and, w, n, hartley, each, observed, new, lines, in, the, emission, spectrum, of, air, that, did, not, match, known, elements, prior, to, 1957, the, symbol, for, argon, was, a, this, was, changed, to, ar, after, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, published, the, work, nomenclature, of, inorganic, chemistry, in, 1957, argon, constitutes, 0, 934, by, volume, and, 1, 288, by, mass, of, earth, s, atmosphere, air, is, the, primary, industrial, source, of, purified, argon, products, argon, is, isolated, from, air, by, fractionation, most, commonly, by, cryogenic, fractional, distillation, a, process, that, also, produces, purified, nitrogen, oxygen, neon, krypton, and, xenon, earth, s, crust, and, seawater, contain, 1, 2, ppm, and, 0, 45, ppm, of, argon, respectively, the, main, isotopes, of, argon, found, on, earth, are, 40, ar, 99, 6, 36, ar, 0, 34, and, 38, ar, 0, 06, naturally, occurring, 40, k, with, a, half, life, of, 1, 25, 10, 9, years, decays, to, stable, 40, ar, 11, 2, by, electron, capture, or, positron, emission, and, also, to, stable, 40, ca, 88, 8, by, beta, decay, these, properties, and, ratios, are, used, to, determine, the, age, of, rocks, by, k, ar, dating, in, earth, s, atmosphere, 39, ar, is, made, by, cosmic, ray, activity, primarily, by, neutron, capture, of, 40, ar, followed, by, two, neutron, emission, in, the, subsurface, environment, it, is, also, produced, through, neutron, capture, by, 39, k, followed, by, proton, emission, 37, ar, is, created, from, the, neutron, capture, by, 40, ca, followed, by, an, alpha, particle, emission, as, a, result, of, subsurface, nuclear, explosions, it, has, a, half, life, of, 35, days, between, locations, in, the, solar, system, the, isotopic, composition, of, argon, varies, greatly, where, the, major, source, of, argon, is, the, decay, of, 40, k, in, rocks, 40, ar, will, be, the, dominant, isotope, as, it, is, on, earth, argon, produced, directly, by, stellar, nucleosynthesis, is, dominated, by, the, alpha, process, nuclide, 36, ar, correspondingly, solar, argon, contains, 84, 6, 36, ar, according, to, solar, wind, measurements, and, the, ratio, of, the, three, isotopes, 36, ar, 38, ar, 40, ar, in, the, atmospheres, of, the, outer, planets, is, 8400, 1600, 1, this, contrasts, with, the, low, abundance, of, primordial, 36, ar, in, earth, s, atmosphere, which, is, only, 31, 5, ppmv, 9340, ppmv, 0, 337, comparable, with, that, of, neon, 18, 18, ppmv, on, earth, and, with, interplanetary, gasses, measured, by, probes, the, atmospheres, of, mars, mercury, and, titan, the, largest, moon, of, saturn, contain, argon, predominantly, as, 40, ar, the, predominance, of, radiogenic, 40, ar, is, the, reason, the, standard, atomic, weight, of, terrestrial, argon, is, greater, than, that, of, the, next, element, potassium, a, fact, that, was, puzzling, when, argon, was, discovered, mendeleev, positioned, the, elements, on, his, periodic, table, in, order, of, atomic, weight, but, the, inertness, of, argon, suggested, a, placement, before, the, reactive, alkali, metal, henry, moseley, later, solved, this, problem, by, showing, that, the, periodic, table, is, actually, arranged, in, order, of, atomic, number, see, history, of, the, periodic, table, argon, s, complete, octet, of, electrons, indicates, full, s, and, p, subshells, this, full, valence, shell, makes, argon, very, stable, and, extremely, resistant, to, bonding, with, other, elements, before, 1962, argon, and, the, other, noble, gases, were, considered, to, be, chemically, inert, and, unable, to, form, compounds, however, compounds, of, the, heavier, noble, gases, have, since, been, synthesized, the, first, argon, compound, with, tungsten, pentacarbonyl, w, co, 5, ar, was, isolated, in, 1975, however, it, was, not, widely, recognised, at, that, time, in, august, 2000, another, argon, compound, argon, fluorohydride, harf, was, formed, by, researchers, at, the, university, of, helsinki, by, shining, ultraviolet, light, onto, frozen, argon, containing, a, small, amount, of, hydrogen, fluoride, with, caesium, iodide, this, discovery, caused, the, recognition, that, argon, could, form, weakly, bound, compounds, even, though, it, was, not, the, first, it, is, stable, up, to, 17, kelvins, 256, c, the, metastable, arcf, 2, 2, dication, which, is, valence, isoelectronic, with, carbonyl, fluoride, and, phosgene, was, observed, in, 2010, argon, 36, in, the, form, of, argon, hydride, argonium, ions, has, been, detected, in, interstellar, medium, associated, with, the, crab, nebula, supernova, this, was, the, first, noble, gas, molecule, detected, in, outer, space, solid, argon, hydride, ar, h, 2, 2, has, the, same, crystal, structure, as, the, mgzn, 2, laves, phase, it, forms, at, pressures, between, 4, 3, and, 220, gpa, though, raman, measurements, suggest, that, the, h, 2, molecules, in, ar, h, 2, 2, dissociate, above, 175, gpa, argon, is, extracted, industrially, by, the, fractional, distillation, of, liquid, air, in, a, cryogenic, air, separation, unit, a, process, that, separates, liquid, nitrogen, which, boils, at, 77, 3, k, from, argon, which, boils, at, 87, 3, k, and, liquid, oxygen, which, boils, at, 90, 2, k, about, 700, 000, tonnes, of, argon, are, produced, worldwide, every, year, argon, has, several, desirable, properties, other, noble, gases, would, be, equally, suitable, for, most, of, these, applications, but, argon, is, by, far, the, cheapest, it, is, inexpensive, since, it, occurs, naturally, in, air, and, is, readily, obtained, as, a, byproduct, of, cryogenic, air, separation, in, the, production, of, liquid, oxygen, and, liquid, nitrogen, the, primary, constituents, of, air, are, used, on, a, large, industrial, scale, the, other, noble, gases, except, helium, are, produced, this, way, as, well, but, argon, is, the, most, plentiful, by, far, the, bulk, of, its, applications, arise, simply, because, it, is, inert, and, relatively, cheap, argon, is, used, in, some, high, temperature, industrial, processes, where, ordinarily, non, reactive, substances, become, reactive, for, example, an, argon, atmosphere, is, used, in, graphite, electric, furnaces, to, prevent, the, graphite, from, burning, for, some, of, these, processes, the, presence, of, nitrogen, or, oxygen, gases, might, cause, defects, within, the, material, argon, is, used, in, some, types, of, arc, welding, such, as, gas, metal, arc, welding, and, gas, tungsten, arc, welding, as, well, as, in, the, processing, of, titanium, and, other, reactive, elements, an, argon, atmosphere, is, also, used, for, growing, crystals, of, silicon, and, germanium, argon, is, used, in, the, poultry, industry, to, asphyxiate, birds, either, for, mass, culling, following, disease, outbreaks, or, as, a, means, of, slaughter, more, humane, than, electric, stunning, argon, is, denser, than, air, and, displaces, oxygen, close, to, the, ground, during, inert, gas, asphyxiation, its, non, reactive, nature, makes, it, suitable, in, a, food, product, and, since, it, replaces, oxygen, within, the, dead, bird, argon, also, enhances, shelf, life, argon, is, sometimes, used, for, extinguishing, fires, where, valuable, equipment, may, be, damaged, by, water, or, foam, liquid, argon, is, used, as, the, target, for, neutrino, experiments, and, direct, dark, matter, searches, the, interaction, between, the, hypothetical, wimps, and, an, argon, nucleus, produces, scintillation, light, that, is, detected, by, photomultiplier, tubes, two, phase, detectors, containing, argon, gas, are, used, to, detect, the, ionized, electrons, produced, during, the, wimp, nucleus, scattering, as, with, most, other, liquefied, noble, gases, argon, has, a, high, scintillation, light, yield, about, 51, photons, kev, is, transparent, to, its, own, scintillation, light, and, is, relatively, easy, to, purify, compared, to, xenon, argon, is, cheaper, and, has, a, distinct, scintillation, time, profile, which, allows, the, separation, of, electronic, recoils, from, nuclear, recoils, on, the, other, hand, its, intrinsic, beta, ray, background, is, larger, due, to, 39, ar, contamination, unless, one, uses, argon, from, underground, sources, which, has, much, less, 39, ar, contamination, most, of, the, argon, in, earth, s, atmosphere, was, produced, by, electron, capture, of, long, lived, 40, k, 40, k, e, 40, ar, present, in, natural, potassium, within, earth, the, 39, ar, activity, in, the, atmosphere, is, maintained, by, cosmogenic, production, through, the, knockout, reaction, 40, ar, n, 2n, 39, ar, and, similar, reactions, the, half, life, of, 39, ar, is, only, 269, years, as, a, result, the, underground, ar, shielded, by, rock, and, water, has, much, less, 39, ar, contamination, dark, matter, detectors, currently, operating, with, liquid, argon, include, darkside, warp, ardm, microclean, and, deap, neutrino, experiments, include, icarus, and, microboone, both, of, which, use, high, purity, liquid, argon, in, a, time, projection, chamber, for, fine, grained, three, dimensional, imaging, of, neutrino, interactions, at, link, ping, university, sweden, the, inert, gas, is, being, utilized, in, a, vacuum, chamber, in, which, plasma, is, introduced, to, ionize, metallic, films, this, process, results, in, a, film, usable, for, manufacturing, computer, processors, the, new, process, would, eliminate, the, need, for, chemical, baths, and, use, of, expensive, dangerous, and, rare, materials, argon, is, used, to, displace, oxygen, and, moisture, containing, air, in, packaging, material, to, extend, the, shelf, lives, of, the, contents, argon, has, the, european, food, additive, code, e938, aerial, oxidation, hydrolysis, and, other, chemical, reactions, that, degrade, the, products, are, retarded, or, prevented, entirely, high, purity, chemicals, and, pharmaceuticals, are, sometimes, packed, and, sealed, in, argon, in, winemaking, argon, is, used, in, a, variety, of, activities, to, provide, a, barrier, against, oxygen, at, the, liquid, surface, which, can, spoil, wine, by, fueling, both, microbial, metabolism, as, with, acetic, acid, bacteria, and, standard, redox, chemistry, argon, is, sometimes, used, as, the, propellant, in, aerosol, cans, argon, is, also, used, as, a, preservative, for, such, products, as, varnish, polyurethane, and, paint, by, displacing, air, to, prepare, a, container, for, storage, since, 2002, the, american, national, archives, stores, important, national, documents, such, as, the, declaration, of, independence, and, the, constitution, within, argon, filled, cases, to, inhibit, their, degradation, argon, is, preferable, to, the, helium, that, had, been, used, in, the, preceding, five, decades, because, helium, gas, escapes, through, the, intermolecular, pores, in, most, containers, and, must, be, regularly, replaced, argon, may, be, used, as, the, inert, gas, within, schlenk, lines, and, gloveboxes, argon, is, preferred, to, less, expensive, nitrogen, in, cases, where, nitrogen, may, react, with, the, reagents, or, apparatus, argon, may, be, used, as, the, carrier, gas, in, gas, chromatography, and, in, electrospray, ionization, mass, spectrometry, it, is, the, gas, of, choice, for, the, plasma, used, in, icp, spectroscopy, argon, is, preferred, for, the, sputter, coating, of, specimens, for, scanning, electron, microscopy, argon, gas, is, also, commonly, used, for, sputter, deposition, of, thin, films, as, in, microelectronics, and, for, wafer, cleaning, in, microfabrication, cryosurgery, procedures, such, as, cryoablation, use, liquid, argon, to, destroy, tissue, such, as, cancer, cells, it, is, used, in, a, procedure, called, argon, enhanced, coagulation, a, form, of, argon, plasma, beam, electrosurgery, the, procedure, carries, a, risk, of, producing, gas, embolism, and, has, resulted, in, the, death, of, at, least, one, patient, blue, argon, lasers, are, used, in, surgery, to, weld, arteries, destroy, tumors, and, correct, eye, defects, argon, has, also, been, used, experimentally, to, replace, nitrogen, in, the, breathing, or, decompression, mix, known, as, argox, to, speed, the, elimination, of, dissolved, nitrogen, from, the, blood, incandescent, lights, are, filled, with, argon, to, preserve, the, filaments, at, high, temperature, from, oxidation, it, is, used, for, the, specific, way, it, ionizes, and, emits, light, such, as, in, plasma, globes, and, calorimetry, in, experimental, particle, physics, gas, discharge, lamps, filled, with, pure, argon, provide, lilac, violet, light, with, argon, and, some, mercury, blue, light, argon, is, also, used, for, blue, and, green, argon, ion, lasers, argon, is, used, for, thermal, insulation, in, energy, efficient, windows, argon, is, also, used, in, technical, scuba, diving, to, inflate, a, dry, suit, because, it, is, inert, and, has, low, thermal, conductivity, argon, is, used, as, a, propellant, in, the, development, of, the, variable, specific, impulse, magnetoplasma, rocket, vasimr, compressed, argon, gas, is, allowed, to, expand, to, cool, the, seeker, heads, of, some, versions, of, the, aim, 9, sidewinder, missile, and, other, missiles, that, use, cooled, thermal, seeker, heads, the, gas, is, stored, at, high, pressure, argon, 39, with, a, half, life, of, 269, years, has, been, used, for, a, number, of, applications, primarily, ice, core, and, ground, water, dating, also, potassium, argon, dating, and, related, argon, argon, dating, are, used, to, date, sedimentary, metamorphic, and, igneous, rocks, argon, has, been, used, by, athletes, as, a, doping, agent, to, simulate, hypoxic, conditions, in, 2014, the, world, anti, doping, agency, wada, added, argon, and, xenon, to, the, list, of, prohibited, substances, and, methods, although, at, this, time, there, is, no, reliable, test, for, abuse, although, argon, is, non, toxic, it, is, 38, more, dense, than, air, and, therefore, considered, a, dangerous, asphyxiant, in, closed, areas, it, is, difficult, to, detect, because, it, is, colorless, odorless, and, tasteless, a, 1994, incident, in, which, a, man, was, asphyxiated, after, entering, an, argon, filled, section, of, oil, pipe, under, construction, in, alaska, highlights, the, dangers, of, argon, tank, leakage, in, confined, spaces, and, emphasizes, the, need, for, proper, use, storage, and, handling
