the, mile, sometimes, the, international, mile, or, statute, mile, to, distinguish, it, from, other, miles, is, a, british, imperial, unit, and, united, states, customary, unit, of, length, both, are, based, on, the, older, english, unit, of, length, equal, to, 5, 280, english, feet, or, 1, 760, yards, the, statute, mile, was, standardised, between, the, commonwealth, of, nations, and, the, united, states, by, an, international, agreement, in, 1959, when, it, was, formally, redefined, with, respect, to, si, units, as, exactly, 1, 609, 344, metres, with, qualifiers, mile, is, also, used, to, describe, or, translate, a, wide, range, of, units, derived, from, or, roughly, equivalent, to, the, roman, mile, roughly, 1, 48, km, such, as, the, nautical, mile, now, 1, 852, km, exactly, the, italian, mile, roughly, 1, 852, km, and, the, chinese, mile, now, 500, m, exactly, the, romans, divided, their, mile, into, 5, 000, ped, s, feet, but, the, greater, importance, of, furlongs, in, the, elizabethan, era, england, meant, that, the, statute, mile, was, made, equivalent, to, 8, furlongs, or, 5, 280, feet, in, 1593, this, form, of, the, mile, then, spread, across, the, british, empire, some, successor, states, of, which, continue, to, employ, the, mile, the, us, geological, survey, now, employs, the, metre, for, official, purposes, but, legacy, data, from, its, 1927, geodetic, datum, has, meant, that, a, separate, us, survey, mile, 6336, 3937, km, continues, to, see, some, use, although, it, was, officially, phased, out, in, 2022, while, most, countries, replaced, the, mile, with, the, kilometre, when, switching, to, the, international, system, of, units, si, the, international, mile, continues, to, be, used, in, some, countries, such, as, liberia, the, united, kingdom, the, united, states, and, a, number, of, countries, with, fewer, than, one, million, inhabitants, most, of, which, are, uk, or, us, territories, or, have, close, historical, ties, with, the, uk, or, us, the, modern, english, word, mile, derives, from, middle, english, myle, and, old, english, m, l, which, was, cognate, with, all, other, germanic, terms, for, miles, these, derived, from, the, nominal, ellipsis, form, of, m, lle, passus, mile, or, m, lia, passuum, miles, the, roman, mile, of, one, thousand, paces, the, present, international, mile, is, usually, what, is, understood, by, the, unqualified, term, mile, when, this, distance, needs, to, be, distinguished, from, the, nautical, mile, the, international, mile, may, also, be, described, as, a, land, mile, or, statute, mile, in, british, english, statute, mile, may, refer, to, the, present, international, mile, or, to, any, other, form, of, english, mile, since, the, 1593, act, of, parliament, which, set, it, as, a, distance, of, 1, 760, yards, under, american, law, however, statute, mile, refers, to, the, us, survey, mile, foreign, and, historical, units, translated, into, english, as, miles, usually, employ, a, qualifier, to, describe, the, kind, of, mile, being, used, but, this, may, be, omitted, if, it, is, obvious, from, the, context, such, as, a, discussion, of, the, 2nd, century, antonine, itinerary, describing, its, distances, in, terms, of, miles, rather, than, roman, miles, the, mile, has, been, variously, abbreviated, in, english, with, and, without, a, trailing, period, as, mi, m, ml, and, m, the, american, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, now, uses, and, recommends, mi, to, avoid, confusion, with, the, si, metre, m, and, millilitre, ml, however, derived, units, such, as, miles, per, hour, or, miles, per, gallon, continue, to, be, abbreviated, as, mph, and, mpg, rather, than, mi, h, and, mi, gal, in, the, united, kingdom, road, signs, use, m, as, the, abbreviation, for, mile, though, height, and, width, restrictions, also, use, m, as, the, symbol, for, the, metre, which, may, be, displayed, alongside, feet, and, inches, the, bbc, style, holds, that, there, is, no, acceptable, abbreviation, for, miles, and, so, it, should, be, spelled, out, when, used, in, describing, areas, the, roman, mile, mille, passus, lit, thousand, paces, abbr, m, p, also, milia, passuum, and, mille, consisted, of, a, thousand, paces, as, measured, by, every, other, step, as, in, the, total, distance, of, the, left, foot, hitting, the, ground, 1, 000, times, when, roman, legionaries, were, well, fed, and, harshly, driven, in, good, weather, they, thus, created, longer, miles, the, distance, was, indirectly, standardised, by, agrippa, s, establishment, of, a, standard, roman, foot, agrippa, s, own, in, 29, bc, and, the, definition, of, a, pace, as, 5, feet, an, imperial, roman, mile, thus, denoted, 5, 000, roman, feet, surveyors, and, specialised, equipment, such, as, the, decempeda, and, dioptra, then, spread, its, use, in, modern, times, agrippa, s, imperial, roman, mile, was, empirically, estimated, to, have, been, about, 1, 618, yards, 1, 479, m, 4, 854, ft, 0, 919, mi, in, length, slightly, less, than, the, 1, 760, yards, 1, 609, m, 5, 280, ft, of, the, modern, international, mile, in, hellenic, areas, of, the, empire, the, roman, mile, greek, m, lion, was, used, beside, the, native, greek, units, as, equivalent, to, 8, stadia, of, 600, greek, feet, the, m, lion, continued, to, be, used, as, a, byzantine, unit, and, was, also, used, as, the, name, of, the, zero, mile, marker, for, the, byzantine, empire, the, milion, located, at, the, head, of, the, mese, near, hagia, sophia, the, roman, mile, spread, throughout, europe, with, its, local, variations, giving, rise, to, the, different, units, also, arising, from, the, roman, mile, is, the, milestone, all, roads, radiated, out, from, the, roman, forum, throughout, the, empire, 50, 000, roman, miles, of, stone, paved, roads, at, every, mile, was, placed, a, shaped, stone, originally, these, were, obelisks, made, from, granite, marble, or, whatever, local, stone, was, available, on, these, was, carved, a, roman, numeral, indicating, the, number, of, miles, from, the, centre, of, rome, the, forum, hence, one, can, know, how, far, one, is, from, rome, the, italian, mile, miglio, pl, miglia, was, traditionally, considered, a, direct, continuation, of, the, roman, mile, equal, to, 1000, paces, although, its, actual, value, over, time, or, between, regions, could, vary, greatly, it, was, often, used, in, international, contexts, from, the, middle, ages, into, the, 17th, century, and, is, thus, also, known, as, the, geographical, mile, although, the, geographical, mile, is, now, a, separate, standard, unit, the, arabic, mile, al, m, l, was, not, the, common, arabic, unit, of, length, instead, arabs, and, persians, traditionally, used, the, longer, parasang, or, arabic, league, the, arabic, mile, was, however, used, by, medieval, geographers, and, scientists, and, constituted, a, kind, of, precursor, to, the, nautical, or, geographical, mile, it, extended, the, roman, mile, to, fit, an, astronomical, approximation, of, 1, arcminute, of, latitude, measured, directly, north, and, south, along, a, meridian, although, the, precise, value, of, the, approximation, remains, disputed, it, was, somewhere, between, 1, 8, and, 2, 0, km, the, old, english, mile, of, the, medieval, and, early, modern, periods, varied, but, seems, to, have, measured, about, 1, 3, international, miles, 2, 1, km, the, old, english, mile, varied, over, time, and, location, within, england, the, old, english, mile, has, also, been, defined, as, 79, 200, or, 79, 320, inches, 1, 25, or, 1, 2519, statute, miles, the, english, long, continued, the, roman, computations, of, the, mile, as, 5, 000, feet, 1, 000, paces, or, 8, longer, divisions, which, they, equated, with, their, furrow, s, length, or, furlong, the, origins, of, english, units, are, extremely, vague, and, uncertain, but, seem, to, have, been, a, combination, of, the, roman, system, with, native, british, and, germanic, systems, both, derived, from, multiples, of, the, barleycorn, probably, by, the, reign, of, edgar, in, the, 10th, century, the, nominal, prototype, physical, standard, of, english, length, was, an, arm, length, iron, bar, a, yardstick, held, by, the, king, at, winchester, the, foot, was, then, one, third, of, its, length, henry, i, was, said, to, have, made, a, new, standard, in, 1101, based, on, his, own, arm, following, the, issuance, of, magna, carta, in, 1215, the, barons, of, parliament, directed, john, and, his, son, to, keep, the, king, s, standard, measure, mensura, domini, regis, and, weight, at, the, exchequer, which, thereafter, verified, local, standards, until, its, abolition, in, the, 19th, century, new, brass, standards, are, known, to, have, been, constructed, under, henry, vii, and, elizabeth, i, arnold, s, c, 1500, customs, of, london, recorded, a, mile, shorter, than, previous, ones, coming, to, 0, 947, international, miles, 5, 000, feet, or, 1, 524, km, the, english, statute, mile, was, established, by, a, weights, and, measures, act, of, parliament, in, 1593, during, the, reign, of, queen, elizabeth, i, the, act, on, the, composition, of, yards, and, perches, had, shortened, the, length, of, the, foot, and, its, associated, measures, causing, the, two, methods, of, determining, the, mile, to, diverge, owing, to, the, importance, of, the, surveyor, s, rod, in, deeds, and, surveying, undertaken, under, henry, viii, decreasing, the, length, of, the, rod, by, 1, 11, would, have, amounted, to, a, significant, tax, increase, parliament, instead, opted, to, maintain, the, mile, of, 8, furlongs, which, were, derived, from, the, rod, and, to, increase, the, number, of, feet, per, mile, from, the, old, roman, value, the, applicable, passage, of, the, statute, reads, a, mile, shall, contain, eight, furlongs, every, furlong, forty, poles, and, every, pole, shall, contain, sixteen, foot, and, an, half, the, statute, mile, therefore, contained, 5, 280, feet, or, 1, 760, yards, the, distance, was, not, uniformly, adopted, robert, morden, had, multiple, scales, on, his, 17th, century, maps, which, included, continuing, local, values, his, map, of, hampshire, for, example, bore, two, different, miles, with, a, ratio, of, 1, 1, 23, and, his, map, of, dorset, had, three, scales, with, a, ratio, of, 1, 1, 23, 1, 41, in, both, cases, the, traditional, local, units, remained, longer, than, the, statute, mile, the, english, statute, mile, was, superseded, in, 1959, by, the, international, mile, by, international, agreement, the, welsh, mile, milltir, or, milldir, was, 3, statute, miles, and, 1, 470, yards, long, 6, 17, km, it, comprised, 9, 000, paces, cam, each, of, 3, welsh, feet, troedfedd, of, 9, inches, modfeddi, the, welsh, inch, is, usually, reckoned, as, equivalent, to, the, english, inch, along, with, other, welsh, units, it, was, said, to, have, been, codified, under, dyfnwal, the, bald, and, silent, and, retained, unchanged, by, hywel, the, good, along, with, other, welsh, units, it, was, discontinued, following, the, conquest, of, wales, by, edward, i, of, england, in, the, 13th, century, the, scots, mile, was, longer, than, the, english, mile, as, mentioned, by, robert, burns, in, the, first, verse, of, his, poem, tam, o, shanter, it, comprised, 8, scots, furlongs, divided, into, 320, falls, or, faws, scots, rods, it, varied, from, place, to, place, but, the, most, accepted, equivalencies, are, 1, 976, imperial, yards, 1, 123, statute, miles, or, 1, 81, km, it, was, legally, abolished, three, times, first, by, a, 1685, act, of, the, scottish, parliament, again, by, the, 1707, treaty, of, union, with, england, and, finally, by, the, weights, and, measures, act, 1824, it, had, continued, in, use, as, a, customary, unit, through, the, 18th, century, but, had, become, obsolete, by, its, final, abolition, the, irish, mile, m, le, or, m, le, gaelach, measured, 2, 240, yards, approximately, 1, 27, statute, miles, or, 2, 048, kilometres, it, was, used, in, ireland, from, the, 16th, century, plantations, until, the, 19th, century, with, residual, use, into, the, 20th, century, the, units, were, based, on, english, measure, but, used, a, linear, perch, measuring, 7, yards, 6, 4, m, as, opposed, to, the, english, rod, of, 5, 5, yards, 5, 0, m, the, dutch, mile, mijl, has, had, different, definitions, throughout, history, one, of, the, older, definitions, was, 5, 600, ells, but, the, length, of, an, ell, was, not, standardised, so, that, the, length, of, a, mile, could, range, between, 3, 280, m, and, 4, 280, m, in, the, sixteenth, the, dutch, had, three, different, miles, small, kleine, medium, middelbaar, gemeen, and, large, groote, the, dutch, kleine, mile, had, the, historical, definition, of, one, hour, s, walking, uur, gaans, which, was, defined, as, 24, stadia, 3000, paces, or, 15, 000, amsterdam, or, rhineland, feet, respectively, 4, 250, m, or, 4, 710, m, the, common, dutch, mile, was, 32, stadia, 4, 000, paces, or, 20, 000, feet, 5, 660, m, or, 6, 280, m, the, large, mile, was, defined, as, 5000, paces, the, common, dutch, mile, was, preferred, by, mariners, equating, with, 15, to, one, degree, of, latitude, or, one, degree, of, longitude, on, the, equator, this, was, originally, based, upon, ptolemy, s, underestimate, of, the, earth, s, circumference, the, ratio, of, 15, dutch, miles, to, a, degree, remained, fixed, while, the, length, of, the, mile, was, changed, as, with, improved, calculations, of, the, circumference, of, the, earth, in, 1617, willebrord, snellius, calculated, a, degree, of, the, circumference, of, the, earth, at, 28, 500, rijnlantsche, roeden, within, 3, 5, of, the, actual, value, which, resulted, in, a, dutch, mile, of, 1900, rods, by, the, mid, seventeenth, century, map, scales, assigned, 2000, rods, to, the, common, dutch, mile, which, equalled, around, 7, 535, m, reducing, the, discrepancy, with, latitude, measurement, to, less, than, 2, the, metric, system, was, introduced, in, the, netherlands, in, 1816, and, the, metric, mile, became, a, synonym, for, the, kilometre, being, exactly, 1, 000, m, since, 1870, the, term, mijl, was, replaced, by, the, equivalent, kilometer, today, the, word, mijl, is, no, longer, used, except, as, part, of, certain, proverbs, and, compound, terms, like, mijlenver, miles, away, the, german, mile, meile, was, 24, 000, german, feet, the, standardised, austrian, mile, used, in, southern, germany, and, the, austrian, empire, was, 7, 586, km, the, prussian, mile, used, in, northern, germany, was, 7, 5325, km, following, its, standardisation, by, ole, r, mer, in, the, late, 17th, century, the, danish, mile, mil, was, precisely, equal, to, the, prussian, mile, and, likewise, divided, into, 24, 000, feet, these, were, sometimes, treated, as, equivalent, to, 7, 5, km, earlier, values, had, varied, the, sj, llandske, miil, for, instance, had, been, 11, 13, km, the, germans, also, used, a, longer, version, of, the, geographical, mile, the, breslau, mile, used, in, breslau, and, from, 1630, officially, in, all, of, silesia, equal, to, 11, 250, ells, or, about, 6, 700, meters, the, mile, equaled, the, distance, from, the, piaskowa, gate, all, the, way, to, psie, pole, hundsfeld, by, rolling, a, circle, with, a, radius, of, 5, ells, through, piaskowa, island, ostr, w, tumski, and, suburban, tracts, passing, eight, bridges, on, the, way, the, standard, breslau, mile, was, determined, the, saxon, post, mile, kurs, chsische, postmeile, or, polizeimeile, introduced, on, occasion, of, a, survey, of, the, saxon, roads, in, the, 1700s, corresponded, to, 2, 000, dresden, rods, equivalent, to, 9, 062, kilometres, the, hungarian, mile, m, rf, ld, or, magyar, m, rf, ld, varied, from, 8, 3790, km, to, 8, 9374, km, before, being, standardised, as, 8, 3536, km, the, portuguese, mile, milha, used, in, portugal, and, brazil, was, 2, 0873, km, prior, to, metrication, the, russian, mile, or, russkaya, milya, was, 7, 468, km, divided, into, 7, versts, the, croatian, mile, hrvatska, milja, first, devised, by, the, jesuit, stjepan, glava, on, a, 1673, map, is, the, length, of, an, arc, of, the, equator, subtended, by, 1, 10, or, 11, 13, km, exactly, the, previous, croatian, mile, now, known, as, the, ban, mile, banska, milja, had, been, the, austrian, mile, given, above, the, ottoman, mile, was, 1, 894, 35, m, 1, 17709, mi, which, was, equal, to, 5, 000, ottoman, foot, after, 1933, the, ottoman, mile, was, replaced, with, the, modern, turkish, mile, 1, 853, 181, m, the, cjk, compatibility, unicode, block, contains, square, format, versions, of, japanese, names, for, measurement, units, as, written, in, katakana, script, among, them, there, is, u, 3344, square, mairu, after, mairu, the, international, mile, is, precisely, equal, to, 1, 609, 344, km, or, 25146, 15625, km, as, a, fraction, it, was, established, as, part, of, the, 1959, international, yard, and, pound, agreement, reached, by, the, united, states, the, united, kingdom, canada, australia, new, zealand, and, the, union, of, south, africa, which, resolved, small, but, measurable, differences, that, had, arisen, from, separate, physical, standards, each, country, had, maintained, for, the, yard, as, with, the, earlier, statute, mile, it, continues, to, comprise, 1, 760, yards, or, 5, 280, feet, the, old, imperial, value, of, the, yard, was, used, in, converting, measurements, to, metric, values, in, india, in, a, 1976, act, of, the, indian, parliament, however, the, current, national, topographic, database, of, the, survey, of, india, is, based, on, the, metric, wgs, 84, datum, which, is, also, used, by, the, global, positioning, system, the, difference, from, the, previous, standards, was, 2, ppm, or, about, 3, 2, millimetres, 1, 8, inch, per, mile, the, us, standard, was, slightly, longer, and, the, old, imperial, standards, had, been, slightly, shorter, than, the, international, mile, when, the, international, mile, was, introduced, in, english, speaking, countries, the, basic, geodetic, datum, in, america, was, the, north, american, datum, of, 1927, nad27, this, had, been, constructed, by, triangulation, based, on, the, definition, of, the, foot, in, the, mendenhall, order, of, 1893, with, 1, foot, 1200, 3937, 0, 304800609601, metres, and, the, definition, was, retained, for, data, derived, from, nad27, but, renamed, the, us, survey, foot, to, distinguish, it, from, the, international, foot, thus, a, survey, mile, 1200, 3937, 5280, 1609, 347218694, metres, an, international, mile, 1609, 344, 1200, 3937, 5280, 0, 999998, survey, miles, the, exact, length, of, the, land, mile, varied, slightly, among, english, speaking, countries, until, the, international, yard, and, pound, agreement, in, 1959, established, the, yard, as, exactly, 0, 9144, metres, giving, a, mile, of, exactly, 1, 609, 344, metres, the, us, adopted, this, international, mile, for, most, purposes, but, retained, the, pre, 1959, mile, for, some, land, survey, data, terming, it, the, u, s, survey, mile, in, the, united, states, statute, mile, normally, refers, to, the, survey, mile, about, 3, 219, mm, 1, 8, inch, longer, than, the, international, mile, the, international, mile, is, exactly, 0, 0002, less, than, the, us, survey, mile, while, most, countries, abandoned, the, mile, when, switching, to, the, metric, system, the, international, mile, continues, to, be, used, in, some, countries, such, as, liberia, myanmar, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, it, is, also, used, in, a, number, of, territories, with, less, than, a, million, inhabitants, most, of, which, are, uk, or, us, territories, or, have, close, historical, ties, with, the, uk, or, us, american, samoa, bahamas, belize, british, virgin, islands, cayman, islands, dominica, falkland, islands, grenada, guam, the, n, mariana, islands, samoa, st, lucia, st, vincent, the, grenadines, st, helena, st, kitts, nevis, the, turks, caicos, islands, and, the, us, virgin, islands, the, mile, is, even, encountered, in, canada, though, this, is, predominantly, in, rail, transport, and, horse, racing, as, the, roadways, have, been, metricated, since, 1977, ireland, gradually, replaced, miles, with, kilometres, including, in, speed, measurements, the, process, was, completed, in, 2005, the, us, survey, mile, is, 5, 280, us, survey, feet, or, 1, 609, 347, metres, and, 0, 30480061, metres, respectively, both, are, very, slightly, longer, than, the, international, mile, and, international, foot, in, the, united, states, the, term, statute, mile, formally, refers, to, the, survey, mile, but, for, most, purposes, the, difference, of, less, than, 1, 8, inch, 3, 2, mm, between, the, survey, mile, and, the, international, mile, 1609, 344, metres, exactly, is, insignificant, one, international, mile, is, 0, 999, 998, us, survey, miles, so, statute, mile, can, be, used, for, either, but, in, some, cases, such, as, in, the, us, state, plane, coordinate, systems, spcss, which, can, stretch, over, hundreds, of, miles, the, accumulated, difference, can, be, significant, so, it, is, important, to, note, that, the, reference, is, to, the, us, survey, mile, the, united, states, redefined, its, yard, in, 1893, and, this, resulted, in, us, and, imperial, measures, of, distance, having, very, slightly, different, lengths, the, north, american, datum, of, 1983, nad83, which, replaced, the, nad27, is, defined, in, metres, state, plane, coordinate, systems, were, then, updated, but, the, national, geodetic, survey, left, individual, states, to, decide, which, if, any, definition, of, the, foot, they, would, use, all, state, plane, coordinate, systems, are, defined, in, metres, and, 42, of, the, 50, states, only, use, the, metre, based, state, plane, coordinate, systems, however, eight, states, also, have, state, plane, coordinate, systems, defined, in, feet, seven, of, them, in, us, survey, feet, and, one, in, international, feet, state, legislation, in, the, us, is, important, for, determining, which, conversion, factor, from, the, metric, datum, is, to, be, used, for, land, surveying, and, real, estate, transactions, even, though, the, difference, 2, ppm, is, hardly, significant, given, the, precision, of, normal, surveying, measurements, over, short, distances, usually, much, less, than, a, mile, twenty, four, states, have, legislated, that, surveying, measures, be, based, on, the, us,

state, legislation, that, has, been, passed, or, updated, using, the, newer, 1983, nad, data, most, states, have, done, so, two, states, alaska, and, missouri, and, two, jurisdictions, guam, and,

islands, do, not, have, spcs, 83, legislation, in, october, 2019, us, national, geodetic, survey, and, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, announced, their, joint, intent, to, retire, the, us, survey, foot, and, us, survey, mile, as, permitted, by, their, 1959, decision, with, effect, on, january, 1, 2023, the, nautical, mile, was, originally, defined, as, one, minute, of, arc, along, a, meridian, of, the, earth, navigators, use, dividers, to, step, off, the, distance, between, two, points, on, the, navigational, chart, then, place, the, open, dividers, against, the, minutes, of, latitude, scale, at, the, edge, of, the, chart, and, read, off, the, distance, in, nautical, miles, the, earth, is, not, perfectly, spherical, but, an, oblate, spheroid, so, the, length, of, a, minute, of, latitude, increases, by, 1, from, the, equator, to, the, poles, using, the, wgs84, ellipsoid, the, commonly, accepted, earth, model, for, many, purposes, today, one, minute, of, latitude, at, the, wgs84, equator, is, 6, 046, feet, and, at, the, poles, is, 6, 107, 5, feet, the, average, is, about, 6, 076, feet, about, 1, 852, metres, or, 1, 15, statute, miles, in, the, united, states, the, nautical, mile, was, defined, in, the, 19th, century, as, 6, 080, 2, feet, 1, 853, 249, m, whereas, in, the, united, kingdom, the, admiralty, nautical, mile, was, defined, as, 6, 080, feet, 1, 853, 184, m, and, was, about, one, minute, of, latitude, in, the, latitudes, of, the, south, of, the, uk, other, nations, had, different, definitions, of, the, nautical, mile, but, it, is, now, internationally, defined, to, be, exactly, 1, 852, metres, 6, 076, 11548556, feet, the, nautical, mile, per, hour, is, known, as, the, knot, nautical, miles, and, knots, are, almost, universally, used, for, aeronautical, and, maritime, navigation, because, of, their, relationship, with, degrees, and, minutes, of, latitude, and, the, convenience, of, using, the, latitude, scale, on, a, map, for, distance, measuring, the, data, mile, is, used, in, radar, related, subjects, and, is, equal, to, 6, 000, feet, 1, 8288, kilometres, the, radar, mile, is, a, unit, of, time, in, the, same, way, that, the, light, year, is, a, unit, of, distance, equal, to, the, time, required, for, a, radar, pulse, to, travel, a, distance, of, two, miles, one, mile, each, way, thus, the, radar, statute, mile, is, 10, 8, s, and, the, radar, nautical, mile, is, 12, 4, s, the, geographical, mile, is, based, upon, the, length, of, a, meridian, of, latitude, the, german, geographical, mile, geographische, meile, was, previously, 1, 15, of, latitude, 7, 4127, km, the, informal, term, metric, mile, is, used, in, some, countries, in, sports, such, as, track, and, field, athletics, and, speed, skating, to, denote, a, distance, of, 1, 500, metres, 0, 932, miles, the, 1500, meters, is, the, premier, middle, distance, running, event, in, olympic, sports, in, united, states, high, school, competition, the, term, is, sometimes, used, for, a, race, of, 1, 600, metres, 0, 994, miles, the, scandinavian, mile, mil, remains, in, common, use, in, norway, and, sweden, where, it, has, meant, precisely, 10, km, since, metrication, in, 1889, it, is, used, in, informal, situations, and, in, measurements, of, fuel, consumption, which, are, often, given, as, litres, per, mil, in, formal, situations, such, as, official, road, signs, only, kilometres, are, given, the, swedish, mile, was, standardised, as, 36, 000, swedish, feet, or, 10, 6884, kilometres, 6, 6415, miles, in, 1649, before, that, it, varied, by, province, from, about, 6, to, 14, 485, km, before, metrication, the, norwegian, mile, was, 11, 298, kilometres, 7, 020, miles, the, traditional, finnish, peninkulma, was, translated, as, swedish, mil, and, also, set, equal, to, 10, km, during, metrication, in, 1887, but, is, much, less, commonly, used, a, comparison, of, the, different, lengths, for, a, mile, in, different, countries, and, at, different, times, in, history, is, given, in, the, table, below, leagues, are, also, included, in, this, list, because, in, terms, of, length, they, fall, in, between, the, short, west, european, miles, and, the, long, north, central, and, eastern, european, miles, similar, units, the, mile, is, still, used, in, a, variety, of, idioms, even, in, english, speaking, countries, that, have, moved, from, the, imperial, to, the, metric, system, for, example, australia, canada, or, new, zealand, these, idioms, include
