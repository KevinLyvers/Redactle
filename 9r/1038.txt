in, physics, scattering, is, a, wide, range, of, physical, processes, where, moving, particles, or, radiation, of, some, form, such, as, light, or, sound, are, forced, to, deviate, from, a, straight, trajectory, by, localized, non, uniformities, including, particles, and, radiation, in, the, medium, through, which, they, pass, in, conventional, use, this, also, includes, deviation, of, reflected, radiation, from, the, angle, predicted, by, the, law, of, reflection, reflections, of, radiation, that, undergo, scattering, are, often, called, diffuse, reflections, and, unscattered, reflections, are, called, specular, mirror, like, reflections, originally, the, term, was, confined, to, light, scattering, going, back, at, least, as, far, as, isaac, newton, in, the, 17th, century, as, more, ray, like, phenomena, were, discovered, the, idea, of, scattering, was, extended, to, them, so, that, william, herschel, could, refer, to, the, scattering, of, heat, rays, not, then, recognized, as, electromagnetic, in, nature, in, 1800, john, tyndall, a, pioneer, in, light, scattering, research, noted, the, connection, between, light, scattering, and, acoustic, scattering, in, the, 1870s, near, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, scattering, of, cathode, rays, electron, beams, and, x, rays, was, observed, and, discussed, with, the, discovery, of, subatomic, particles, e, g, ernest, rutherford, in, 1911, and, the, development, of, quantum, theory, in, the, 20th, century, the, sense, of, the, term, became, broader, as, it, was, recognized, that, the, same, mathematical, frameworks, used, in, light, scattering, could, be, applied, to, many, other, phenomena, scattering, can, refer, to, the, consequences, of, particle, particle, collisions, between, molecules, atoms, electrons, photons, and, other, particles, examples, include, cosmic, ray, scattering, in, the, earth, s, upper, atmosphere, particle, collisions, inside, particle, accelerators, electron, scattering, by, gas, atoms, in, fluorescent, lamps, and, neutron, scattering, inside, nuclear, reactors, the, types, of, non, uniformities, which, can, cause, scattering, sometimes, known, as, scatterers, or, scattering, centers, are, too, numerous, to, list, but, a, small, sample, includes, particles, bubbles, droplets, density, fluctuations, in, fluids, crystallites, in, polycrystalline, solids, defects, in, monocrystalline, solids, surface, roughness, cells, in, organisms, and, textile, fibers, in, clothing, the, effects, of, such, features, on, the, path, of, almost, any, type, of, propagating, wave, or, moving, particle, can, be, described, in, the, framework, of, scattering, theory, some, areas, where, scattering, and, scattering, theory, are, significant, include, radar, sensing, medical, ultrasound, semiconductor, wafer, inspection, polymerization, process, monitoring, acoustic, tiling, free, space, communications, and, computer, generated, imagery, particle, particle, scattering, theory, is, important, in, areas, such, as, particle, physics, atomic, molecular, and, optical, physics, nuclear, physics, and, astrophysics, in, particle, physics, the, quantum, interaction, and, scattering, of, fundamental, particles, is, described, by, the, scattering, matrix, or, s, matrix, introduced, and, developed, by, john, archibald, wheeler, and, werner, heisenberg, scattering, is, quantified, using, many, different, concepts, including, scattering, cross, section, attenuation, coefficients, the, bidirectional, scattering, distribution, function, bsdf, s, matrices, and, mean, free, path, when, radiation, is, only, scattered, by, one, localized, scattering, center, this, is, called, single, scattering, it, is, more, common, that, scattering, centers, are, grouped, together, in, such, cases, radiation, may, scatter, many, times, in, what, is, known, as, multiple, scattering, the, main, difference, between, the, effects, of, single, and, multiple, scattering, is, that, single, scattering, can, usually, be, treated, as, a, random, phenomenon, whereas, multiple, scattering, somewhat, counterintuitively, can, be, modeled, as, a, more, deterministic, process, because, the, combined, results, of, a, large, number, of, scattering, events, tend, to, average, out, multiple, scattering, can, thus, often, be, modeled, well, with, diffusion, theory, because, the, location, of, a, single, scattering, center, is, not, usually, well, known, relative, to, the, path, of, the, radiation, the, outcome, which, tends, to, depend, strongly, on, the, exact, incoming, trajectory, appears, random, to, an, observer, this, type, of, scattering, would, be, exemplified, by, an, electron, being, fired, at, an, atomic, nucleus, in, this, case, the, atom, s, exact, position, relative, to, the, path, of, the, electron, is, unknown, and, would, be, unmeasurable, so, the, exact, trajectory, of, the, electron, after, the, collision, cannot, be, predicted, single, scattering, is, therefore, often, described, by, probability, distributions, with, multiple, scattering, the, randomness, of, the, interaction, tends, to, be, averaged, out, by, a, large, number, of, scattering, events, so, that, the, final, path, of, the, radiation, appears, to, be, a, deterministic, distribution, of, intensity, this, is, exemplified, by, a, light, beam, passing, through, thick, fog, multiple, scattering, is, highly, analogous, to, diffusion, and, the, terms, multiple, scattering, and, diffusion, are, interchangeable, in, many, contexts, optical, elements, designed, to, produce, multiple, scattering, are, thus, known, as, diffusers, coherent, backscattering, an, enhancement, of, backscattering, that, occurs, when, coherent, radiation, is, multiply, scattered, by, a, random, medium, is, usually, attributed, to, weak, localization, not, all, single, scattering, is, random, however, a, well, controlled, laser, beam, can, be, exactly, positioned, to, scatter, off, a, microscopic, particle, with, a, deterministic, outcome, for, instance, such, situations, are, encountered, in, radar, scattering, as, well, where, the, targets, tend, to, be, macroscopic, objects, such, as, people, or, aircraft, similarly, multiple, scattering, can, sometimes, have, somewhat, random, outcomes, particularly, with, coherent, radiation, the, random, fluctuations, in, the, multiply, scattered, intensity, of, coherent, radiation, are, called, speckles, speckle, also, occurs, if, multiple, parts, of, a, coherent, wave, scatter, from, different, centers, in, certain, rare, circumstances, multiple, scattering, may, only, involve, a, small, number, of, interactions, such, that, the, randomness, is, not, completely, averaged, out, these, systems, are, considered, to, be, some, of, the, most, difficult, to, model, accurately, the, description, of, scattering, and, the, distinction, between, single, and, multiple, scattering, are, tightly, related, to, wave, particle, duality, scattering, theory, is, a, framework, for, studying, and, understanding, the, scattering, of, waves, and, particles, prosaically, wave, scattering, corresponds, to, the, collision, and, scattering, of, a, wave, with, some, material, object, for, instance, sunlight, scattered, by, rain, drops, to, form, a, rainbow, scattering, also, includes, the, interaction, of, billiard, balls, on, a, table, the, rutherford, scattering, or, angle, change, of, alpha, particles, by, gold, nuclei, the, bragg, scattering, or, diffraction, of, electrons, and, x, rays, by, a, cluster, of, atoms, and, the, inelastic, scattering, of, a, fission, fragment, as, it, traverses, a, thin, foil, more, precisely, scattering, consists, of, the, study, of, how, solutions, of, partial, differential, equations, propagating, freely, in, the, distant, past, come, together, and, interact, with, one, another, or, with, a, boundary, condition, and, then, propagate, away, to, the, distant, future, the, direct, scattering, problem, is, the, problem, of, determining, the, distribution, of, scattered, radiation, particle, flux, basing, on, the, characteristics, of, the, scatterer, the, inverse, scattering, problem, is, the, problem, of, determining, the, characteristics, of, an, object, e, g, its, shape, internal, constitution, from, measurement, data, of, radiation, or, particles, scattered, from, the, object, when, the, target, is, a, set, of, many, scattering, centers, whose, relative, position, varies, unpredictably, it, is, customary, to, think, of, a, range, equation, whose, arguments, take, different, forms, in, different, application, areas, in, the, simplest, case, consider, an, interaction, that, removes, particles, from, the, unscattered, beam, at, a, uniform, rate, that, is, proportional, to, the, incident, number, of, particles, per, unit, area, per, unit, time, i, displaystyle, i, i, e, that, where, q, is, an, interaction, coefficient, and, x, is, the, distance, traveled, in, the, target, the, above, ordinary, first, order, differential, equation, has, solutions, of, the, form, where, i, o, is, the, initial, flux, path, length, x, x, x, o, the, second, equality, defines, an, interaction, mean, free, path, the, third, uses, the, number, of, targets, per, unit, volume, to, define, an, area, cross, section, and, the, last, uses, the, target, mass, density, to, define, a, density, mean, free, path, hence, one, converts, between, these, quantities, via, q, 1, as, shown, in, the, figure, at, left, in, electromagnetic, absorption, spectroscopy, for, example, interaction, coefficient, e, g, q, in, cm, 1, is, variously, called, opacity, absorption, coefficient, and, attenuation, coefficient, in, nuclear, physics, area, cross, sections, e, g, in, barns, or, units, of, 10, 24, cm, 2, density, mean, free, path, e, g, in, grams, cm, 2, and, its, reciprocal, the, mass, attenuation, coefficient, e, g, in, cm, 2, gram, or, area, per, nucleon, are, all, popular, while, in, electron, microscopy, the, inelastic, mean, free, path, e, g, in, nanometers, is, often, discussed, instead, the, term, elastic, scattering, implies, that, the, internal, states, of, the, scattering, particles, do, not, change, and, hence, they, emerge, unchanged, from, the, scattering, process, in, inelastic, scattering, by, contrast, the, particles, internal, state, is, changed, which, may, amount, to, exciting, some, of, the, electrons, of, a, scattering, atom, or, the, complete, annihilation, of, a, scattering, particle, and, the, creation, of, entirely, new, particles, the, example, of, scattering, in, quantum, chemistry, is, particularly, instructive, as, the, theory, is, reasonably, complex, while, still, having, a, good, foundation, on, which, to, build, an, intuitive, understanding, when, two, atoms, are, scattered, off, one, another, one, can, understand, them, as, being, the, bound, state, solutions, of, some, differential, equation, thus, for, example, the, hydrogen, atom, corresponds, to, a, solution, to, the, schr, dinger, equation, with, a, negative, inverse, power, i, e, attractive, coulombic, central, potential, the, scattering, of, two, hydrogen, atoms, will, disturb, the, state, of, each, atom, resulting, in, one, or, both, becoming, excited, or, even, ionized, representing, an, inelastic, scattering, process, the, term, deep, inelastic, scattering, refers, to, a, special, kind, of, scattering, experiment, in, particle, physics, in, mathematics, scattering, theory, deals, with, a, more, abstract, formulation, of, the, same, set, of, concepts, for, example, if, a, differential, equation, is, known, to, have, some, simple, localized, solutions, and, the, solutions, are, a, function, of, a, single, parameter, that, parameter, can, take, the, conceptual, role, of, time, one, then, asks, what, might, happen, if, two, such, solutions, are, set, up, far, away, from, each, other, in, the, distant, past, and, are, made, to, move, towards, each, other, interact, under, the, constraint, of, the, differential, equation, and, then, move, apart, in, the, future, the, scattering, matrix, then, pairs, solutions, in, the, distant, past, to, those, in, the, distant, future, solutions, to, differential, equations, are, often, posed, on, manifolds, frequently, the, means, to, the, solution, requires, the, study, of, the, spectrum, of, an, operator, on, the, manifold, as, a, result, the, solutions, often, have, a, spectrum, that, can, be, identified, with, a, hilbert, space, and, scattering, is, described, by, a, certain, map, the, s, matrix, on, hilbert, spaces, solutions, with, a, discrete, spectrum, correspond, to, bound, states, in, quantum, mechanics, while, a, continuous, spectrum, is, associated, with, scattering, states, the, study, of, inelastic, scattering, then, asks, how, discrete, and, continuous, spectra, are, mixed, together, an, important, notable, development, is, the, inverse, scattering, transform, central, to, the, solution, of, many, exactly, solvable, models, in, mathematical, physics, scattering, theory, is, a, framework, for, studying, and, understanding, the, interaction, or, scattering, of, solutions, to, partial, differential, equations, in, acoustics, the, differential, equation, is, the, wave, equation, and, scattering, studies, how, its, solutions, the, sound, waves, scatter, from, solid, objects, or, propagate, through, non, uniform, media, such, as, sound, waves, in, sea, water, coming, from, a, submarine, in, the, case, of, classical, electrodynamics, the, differential, equation, is, again, the, wave, equation, and, the, scattering, of, light, or, radio, waves, is, studied, in, particle, physics, the, equations, are, those, of, quantum, electrodynamics, quantum, chromodynamics, and, the, standard, model, the, solutions, of, which, correspond, to, fundamental, particles, in, regular, quantum, mechanics, which, includes, quantum, chemistry, the, relevant, equation, is, the, schr, dinger, equation, although, equivalent, formulations, such, as, the, lippmann, schwinger, equation, and, the, faddeev, equations, are, also, largely, used, the, solutions, of, interest, describe, the, long, term, motion, of, free, atoms, molecules, photons, electrons, and, protons, the, scenario, is, that, several, particles, come, together, from, an, infinite, distance, away, these, reagents, then, collide, optionally, reacting, getting, destroyed, or, creating, new, particles, the, products, and, unused, reagents, then, fly, away, to, infinity, again, the, atoms, and, molecules, are, effectively, particles, for, our, purposes, also, under, everyday, circumstances, only, photons, are, being, created, and, destroyed, the, solutions, reveal, which, directions, the, products, are, most, likely, to, fly, off, to, and, how, quickly, they, also, reveal, the, probability, of, various, reactions, creations, and, decays, occurring, there, are, two, predominant, techniques, of, finding, solutions, to, scattering, problems, partial, wave, analysis, and, the, born, approximation, electromagnetic, waves, are, one, of, the, best, known, and, most, commonly, encountered, forms, of, radiation, that, undergo, scattering, scattering, of, light, and, radio, waves, especially, in, radar, is, particularly, important, several, different, aspects, of, electromagnetic, scattering, are, distinct, enough, to, have, conventional, names, major, forms, of, elastic, light, scattering, involving, negligible, energy, transfer, are, rayleigh, scattering, and, mie, scattering, inelastic, scattering, includes, brillouin, scattering, raman, scattering, inelastic, x, ray, scattering, and, compton, scattering, light, scattering, is, one, of, the, two, major, physical, processes, that, contribute, to, the, visible, appearance, of, most, objects, the, other, being, absorption, surfaces, described, as, white, owe, their, appearance, to, multiple, scattering, of, light, by, internal, or, surface, inhomogeneities, in, the, object, for, example, by, the, boundaries, of, transparent, microscopic, crystals, that, make, up, a, stone, or, by, the, microscopic, fibers, in, a, sheet, of, paper, more, generally, the, gloss, or, lustre, or, sheen, of, the, surface, is, determined, by, scattering, highly, scattering, surfaces, are, described, as, being, dull, or, having, a, matte, finish, while, the, absence, of, surface, scattering, leads, to, a, glossy, appearance, as, with, polished, metal, or, stone, spectral, absorption, the, selective, absorption, of, certain, colors, determines, the, color, of, most, objects, with, some, modification, by, elastic, scattering, the, apparent, blue, color, of, veins, in, skin, is, a, common, example, where, both, spectral, absorption, and, scattering, play, important, and, complex, roles, in, the, coloration, light, scattering, can, also, create, color, without, absorption, often, shades, of, blue, as, with, the, sky, rayleigh, scattering, the, human, blue, iris, and, the, feathers, of, some, birds, prum, et, al, 1998, however, resonant, light, scattering, in, nanoparticles, can, produce, many, different, highly, saturated, and, vibrant, hues, especially, when, surface, plasmon, resonance, is, involved, roqu, et, al, 2006, models, of, light, scattering, can, be, divided, into, three, domains, based, on, a, dimensionless, size, parameter, which, is, defined, as, d, p, displaystyle, alpha, pi, d, text, p, lambda, where, d, p, is, the, circumference, of, a, particle, and, is, the, wavelength, of, incident, radiation, in, the, medium, based, on, the, value, of, these, domains, are, rayleigh, scattering, is, a, process, in, which, electromagnetic, radiation, including, light, is, scattered, by, a, small, spherical, volume, of, variant, refractive, indexes, such, as, a, particle, bubble, droplet, or, even, a, density, fluctuation, this, effect, was, first, modeled, successfully, by, lord, rayleigh, from, whom, it, gets, its, name, in, order, for, rayleigh, s, model, to, apply, the, sphere, must, be, much, smaller, in, diameter, than, the, wavelength, of, the, scattered, wave, typically, the, upper, limit, is, taken, to, be, about, 1, 10, the, wavelength, in, this, size, regime, the, exact, shape, of, the, scattering, center, is, usually, not, very, significant, and, can, often, be, treated, as, a, sphere, of, equivalent, volume, the, inherent, scattering, that, radiation, undergoes, passing, through, a, pure, gas, is, due, to, microscopic, density, fluctuations, as, the, gas, molecules, move, around, which, are, normally, small, enough, in, scale, for, rayleigh, s, model, to, apply, this, scattering, mechanism, is, the, primary, cause, of, the, blue, color, of, the, earth, s, sky, on, a, clear, day, as, the, shorter, blue, wavelengths, of, sunlight, passing, overhead, are, more, strongly, scattered, than, the, longer, red, wavelengths, according, to, rayleigh, s, famous, 1, 4, relation, along, with, absorption, such, scattering, is, a, major, cause, of, the, attenuation, of, radiation, by, the, atmosphere, the, degree, of, scattering, varies, as, a, function, of, the, ratio, of, the, particle, diameter, to, the, wavelength, of, the, radiation, along, with, many, other, factors, including, polarization, angle, and, coherence, for, larger, diameters, the, problem, of, electromagnetic, scattering, by, spheres, was, first, solved, by, gustav, mie, and, scattering, by, spheres, larger, than, the, rayleigh, range, is, therefore, usually, known, as, mie, scattering, in, the, mie, regime, the, shape, of, the, scattering, center, becomes, much, more, significant, and, the, theory, only, applies, well, to, spheres, and, with, some, modification, spheroids, and, ellipsoids, closed, form, solutions, for, scattering, by, certain, other, simple, shapes, exist, but, no, general, closed, form, solution, is, known, for, arbitrary, shapes, both, mie, and, rayleigh, scattering, are, considered, elastic, scattering, processes, in, which, the, energy, and, thus, wavelength, and, frequency, of, the, light, is, not, substantially, changed, however, electromagnetic, radiation, scattered, by, moving, scattering, centers, does, undergo, a, doppler, shift, which, can, be, detected, and, used, to, measure, the, velocity, of, the, scattering, center, s, in, forms, of, techniques, such, as, lidar, and, radar, this, shift, involves, a, slight, change, in, energy, at, values, of, the, ratio, of, particle, diameter, to, wavelength, more, than, about, 10, the, laws, of, geometric, optics, are, mostly, sufficient, to, describe, the, interaction, of, light, with, the, particle, mie, theory, can, still, be, used, for, these, larger, spheres, but, the, solution, often, becomes, numerically, unwieldy, for, modeling, of, scattering, in, cases, where, the, rayleigh, and, mie, models, do, not, apply, such, as, larger, irregularly, shaped, particles, there, are, many, numerical, methods, that, can, be, used, the, most, common, are, finite, element, methods, which, solve, maxwell, s, equations, to, find, the, distribution, of, the, scattered, electromagnetic, field, sophisticated, software, packages, exist, which, allow, the, user, to, specify, the, refractive, index, or, indices, of, the, scattering, feature, in, space, creating, a, 2, or, sometimes, 3, dimensional, model, of, the, structure, for, relatively, large, and, complex, structures, these, models, usually, require, substantial, execution, times, on, a, computer, electrophoresis, involves, the, migration, of, macromolecules, under, the, influence, of, an, electric, field, electrophoretic, light, scattering, involves, passing, an, electric, field, through, a, liquid, which, makes, particles, move, the, bigger, the, charge, is, on, the, particles, the, faster, they, are, able, to, move
