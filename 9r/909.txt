electric, charge, symbol, q, sometimes, q, is, the, physical, property, of, matter, that, causes, it, to, experience, a, force, when, placed, in, an, electromagnetic, field, electric, charge, can, be, positive, or, negative, like, charges, repel, each, other, and, unlike, charges, attract, each, other, an, object, with, no, net, charge, is, referred, to, as, electrically, neutral, early, knowledge, of, how, charged, substances, interact, is, now, called, classical, electrodynamics, and, is, still, accurate, for, problems, that, do, not, require, consideration, of, quantum, effects, electric, charge, is, a, conserved, property, the, net, charge, of, an, isolated, system, the, quantity, of, positive, charge, minus, the, amount, of, negative, charge, cannot, change, electric, charge, is, carried, by, subatomic, particles, in, ordinary, matter, negative, charge, is, carried, by, electrons, and, positive, charge, is, carried, by, the, protons, in, the, nuclei, of, atoms, if, there, are, more, electrons, than, protons, in, a, piece, of, matter, it, will, have, a, negative, charge, if, there, are, fewer, it, will, have, a, positive, charge, and, if, there, are, equal, numbers, it, will, be, neutral, charge, is, quantized, it, comes, in, integer, multiples, of, individual, small, units, called, the, elementary, charge, e, about, 1, 602, 10, 19, c, which, is, the, smallest, charge, that, can, exist, freely, particles, called, quarks, have, smaller, charges, multiples, of, 1, 3, e, but, they, are, found, only, combined, in, particles, that, have, a, charge, that, is, an, integer, multiple, of, e, in, the, standard, model, charge, is, an, absolutely, conserved, quantum, number, the, proton, has, a, charge, of, e, and, the, electron, has, a, charge, of, e, today, a, negative, charge, is, defined, as, the, charge, carried, by, an, electron, and, a, positive, charge, is, that, carried, by, a, proton, before, these, particles, were, discovered, a, positive, charge, was, defined, by, benjamin, franklin, as, the, charge, acquired, by, a, glass, rod, when, it, is, rubbed, with, a, silk, cloth, electric, charges, produce, electric, fields, a, moving, charge, also, produces, a, magnetic, field, the, interaction, of, electric, charges, with, an, electromagnetic, field, a, combination, of, an, electric, and, a, magnetic, field, is, the, source, of, the, electromagnetic, or, lorentz, force, which, is, one, of, the, four, fundamental, interactions, in, physics, the, study, of, photon, mediated, interactions, among, charged, particles, is, called, quantum, electrodynamics, the, si, derived, unit, of, electric, charge, is, the, coulomb, c, named, after, french, physicist, charles, augustin, de, coulomb, in, electrical, engineering, it, is, also, common, to, use, the, ampere, hour, a, h, in, physics, and, chemistry, it, is, common, to, use, the, elementary, charge, e, as, a, unit, chemistry, also, uses, the, faraday, constant, which, is, the, charge, of, one, mole, of, elementary, charges, charge, is, the, fundamental, property, of, matter, that, exhibits, electrostatic, attraction, or, repulsion, in, the, presence, of, other, matter, with, charge, electric, charge, is, a, characteristic, property, of, many, subatomic, particles, the, charges, of, free, standing, particles, are, integer, multiples, of, the, elementary, charge, e, we, say, that, electric, charge, is, quantized, michael, faraday, in, his, electrolysis, experiments, was, the, first, to, note, the, discrete, nature, of, electric, charge, robert, millikan, s, oil, drop, experiment, demonstrated, this, fact, directly, and, measured, the, elementary, charge, it, has, been, discovered, that, one, type, of, particle, quarks, have, fractional, charges, of, either, 1, 3, or, 2, 3, but, it, is, believed, they, always, occur, in, multiples, of, integral, charge, free, standing, quarks, have, never, been, observed, by, convention, the, charge, of, an, electron, is, negative, e, while, that, of, a, proton, is, positive, e, charged, particles, whose, charges, have, the, same, sign, repel, one, another, and, particles, whose, charges, have, different, signs, attract, coulomb, s, law, quantifies, the, electrostatic, force, between, two, particles, by, asserting, that, the, force, is, proportional, to, the, product, of, their, charges, and, inversely, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, distance, between, them, the, charge, of, an, antiparticle, equals, that, of, the, corresponding, particle, but, with, opposite, sign, the, electric, charge, of, a, macroscopic, object, is, the, sum, of, the, electric, charges, of, the, particles, that, it, is, made, up, of, this, charge, is, often, small, because, matter, is, made, of, atoms, and, atoms, typically, have, equal, numbers, of, protons, and, electrons, in, which, case, their, charges, cancel, out, yielding, a, net, charge, of, zero, thus, making, the, atom, neutral, an, ion, is, an, atom, or, group, of, atoms, that, has, lost, one, or, more, electrons, giving, it, a, net, positive, charge, cation, or, that, has, gained, one, or, more, electrons, giving, it, a, net, negative, charge, anion, monatomic, ions, are, formed, from, single, atoms, while, polyatomic, ions, are, formed, from, two, or, more, atoms, that, have, been, bonded, together, in, each, case, yielding, an, ion, with, a, positive, or, negative, net, charge, during, the, formation, of, macroscopic, objects, constituent, atoms, and, ions, usually, combine, to, form, structures, composed, of, neutral, ionic, compounds, electrically, bound, to, neutral, atoms, thus, macroscopic, objects, tend, toward, being, neutral, overall, but, macroscopic, objects, are, rarely, perfectly, net, neutral, sometimes, macroscopic, objects, contain, ions, distributed, throughout, the, material, rigidly, bound, in, place, giving, an, overall, net, positive, or, negative, charge, to, the, object, also, macroscopic, objects, made, of, conductive, elements, can, more, or, less, easily, depending, on, the, element, take, on, or, give, off, electrons, and, then, maintain, a, net, negative, or, positive, charge, indefinitely, when, the, net, electric, charge, of, an, object, is, non, zero, and, motionless, the, phenomenon, is, known, as, static, electricity, this, can, easily, be, produced, by, rubbing, two, dissimilar, materials, together, such, as, rubbing, amber, with, fur, or, glass, with, silk, in, this, way, non, conductive, materials, can, be, charged, to, a, significant, degree, either, positively, or, negatively, charge, taken, from, one, material, is, moved, to, the, other, material, leaving, an, opposite, charge, of, the, same, magnitude, behind, the, law, of, conservation, of, charge, always, applies, giving, the, object, from, which, a, negative, charge, is, taken, a, positive, charge, of, the, same, magnitude, and, vice, versa, even, when, an, object, s, net, charge, is, zero, the, charge, can, be, distributed, non, uniformly, in, the, object, e, g, due, to, an, external, electromagnetic, field, or, bound, polar, molecules, in, such, cases, the, object, is, said, to, be, polarized, the, charge, due, to, polarization, is, known, as, bound, charge, while, the, charge, on, an, object, produced, by, electrons, gained, or, lost, from, outside, the, object, is, called, free, charge, the, motion, of, electrons, in, conductive, metals, in, a, specific, direction, is, known, as, electric, current, the, si, unit, of, quantity, of, electric, charge, is, the, coulomb, symbol, c, the, coulomb, is, defined, as, the, quantity, of, charge, that, passes, through, the, cross, section, of, an, electrical, conductor, carrying, one, ampere, for, one, second, this, unit, was, proposed, in, 1946, and, ratified, in, 1948, the, lowercase, symbol, q, is, often, used, to, denote, a, quantity, of, electric, charge, the, quantity, of, electric, charge, can, be, directly, measured, with, an, electrometer, or, indirectly, measured, with, a, ballistic, galvanometer, the, elementary, charge, the, electric, charge, of, the, proton, is, defined, as, a, fundamental, constant, in, the, si, the, value, for, elementary, charge, when, expressed, in, si, units, is, exactly, 1, 602, 176, 634, 10, 19, c, after, discovering, the, quantized, character, of, charge, in, 1891, george, stoney, proposed, the, unit, electron, for, this, fundamental, unit, of, electrical, charge, j, j, thomson, subsequently, discovered, the, particle, that, we, now, call, the, electron, in, 1897, the, unit, is, today, referred, to, as, elementary, charge, fundamental, unit, of, charge, or, simply, denoted, e, with, the, charge, of, an, electron, being, e, the, charge, of, an, isolated, system, should, be, a, multiple, of, the, elementary, charge, e, even, if, at, large, scales, charge, seems, to, behave, as, a, continuous, quantity, in, some, contexts, it, is, meaningful, to, speak, of, fractions, of, an, elementary, charge, for, example, in, the, fractional, quantum, hall, effect, the, unit, faraday, is, sometimes, used, in, electrochemistry, one, faraday, is, the, magnitude, of, the, charge, of, one, mole, of, elementary, charges, i, e, 9, 648, 533, 212, 10, 4, c, from, ancient, times, people, were, familiar, with, four, types, of, phenomena, that, today, would, all, be, explained, using, the, concept, of, electric, charge, a, lightning, b, the, torpedo, fish, or, electric, ray, c, st, elmo, s, fire, and, d, that, amber, rubbed, with, fur, would, attract, small, light, objects, the, first, account, of, the, amber, effect, is, often, attributed, to, the, ancient, greek, mathematician, thales, of, miletus, who, lived, from, c, 624, to, c, 546, bc, but, there, are, doubts, about, whether, thales, left, any, writings, his, account, about, amber, is, known, from, an, account, from, early, 200s, this, account, can, be, taken, as, evidence, that, the, phenomenon, was, known, since, at, least, c, 600, bc, but, thales, explained, this, phenomenon, as, evidence, for, inanimate, objects, having, a, soul, in, other, words, there, was, no, indication, of, any, conception, of, electric, charge, more, generally, the, ancient, greeks, did, not, understand, the, connections, among, these, four, kinds, of, phenomena, the, greeks, observed, that, the, charged, amber, buttons, could, attract, light, objects, such, as, hair, they, also, found, that, if, they, rubbed, the, amber, for, long, enough, they, could, even, get, an, electric, spark, to, jump, but, there, is, also, a, claim, that, no, mention, of, electric, sparks, appeared, until, late, 17th, century, this, property, derives, from, the, triboelectric, effect, in, late, 1100s, the, substance, jet, a, compacted, form, of, coal, was, noted, to, have, an, amber, effect, and, in, the, middle, of, the, 1500s, girolamo, fracastoro, discovered, that, diamond, also, showed, this, effect, some, efforts, were, made, by, fracastoro, and, others, especially, gerolamo, cardano, to, develop, explanations, for, this, phenomenon, in, contrast, to, astronomy, mechanics, and, optics, which, had, been, studied, quantitatively, since, antiquity, the, start, of, ongoing, qualitative, and, quantitative, research, into, electrical, phenomena, can, be, marked, with, the, publication, of, de, magnete, by, the, english, scientist, william, gilbert, in, 1600, in, this, book, there, was, a, small, section, where, gilbert, returned, to, the, amber, effect, as, he, called, it, in, addressing, many, of, the, earlier, theories, and, coined, the, neo, latin, word, electrica, from, lektron, the, greek, word, for, amber, the, latin, word, was, translated, into, english, as, electrics, gilbert, is, also, credited, with, the, term, electrical, while, the, term, electricity, came, later, first, attributed, to, sir, thomas, browne, in, his, pseudodoxia, epidemica, from, 1646, for, more, linguistic, details, see, etymology, of, electricity, gilbert, hypothesized, that, this, amber, effect, could, be, explained, by, an, effluvium, a, small, stream, of, particles, that, flows, from, the, electric, object, without, diminishing, its, bulk, or, weight, that, acts, on, other, objects, this, idea, of, a, material, electrical, effluvium, was, influential, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, it, was, a, precursor, to, ideas, developed, in, the, 18th, century, about, electric, fluid, dufay, nollet, franklin, and, electric, charge, around, 1663, otto, von, guericke, invented, what, was, probably, the, first, electrostatic, generator, but, he, did, not, recognize, it, primarily, as, an, electrical, device, and, only, conducted, minimal, electrical, experiments, with, it, other, european, pioneers, were, robert, boyle, who, in, 1675, published, the, first, book, in, english, that, was, devoted, solely, to, electrical, phenomena, his, work, was, largely, a, repetition, of, gilbert, s, studies, but, he, also, identified, several, more, electrics, and, noted, mutual, attraction, between, two, bodies, in, 1729, stephen, gray, was, experimenting, with, static, electricity, which, he, generated, using, a, glass, tube, he, noticed, that, a, cork, used, to, protect, the, tube, from, dust, and, moisture, also, became, electrified, charged, further, experiments, e, g, extending, the, cork, by, putting, thin, sticks, into, it, showed, for, the, first, time, that, electrical, effluvia, as, gray, called, it, could, be, transmitted, conducted, over, a, distance, gray, managed, to, transmit, charge, with, twine, 765, feet, and, wire, 865, feet, through, these, experiments, gray, discovered, the, importance, of, different, materials, which, facilitated, or, hindered, the, conduction, of, electrical, effluvia, john, theophilus, desaguliers, who, repeated, many, of, gray, s, experiments, is, credited, with, coining, the, terms, conductors, and, insulators, to, refer, to, the, effects, of, different, materials, in, these, experiments, gray, also, discovered, electrical, induction, i, e, where, charge, could, be, transmitted, from, one, object, to, another, without, any, direct, physical, contact, for, example, he, showed, that, by, bringing, a, charged, glass, tube, close, to, but, not, touching, a, lump, of, lead, that, was, sustained, by, a, thread, it, was, possible, to, make, the, lead, become, electrified, e, g, to, attract, and, repel, brass, filings, he, attempted, to, explain, this, phenomenon, with, the, idea, of, electrical, effluvia, gray, s, discoveries, introduced, an, important, shift, in, the, historical, development, of, knowledge, about, electric, charge, the, fact, that, electrical, effluvia, could, be, transferred, from, one, object, to, another, opened, the, theoretical, possibility, that, this, property, was, not, inseparably, connected, to, the, bodies, that, were, electrified, by, rubbing, in, 1733, charles, fran, ois, de, cisternay, du, fay, inspired, by, gray, s, work, made, a, series, of, experiments, reported, in, m, moires, de, l, acad, mie, royale, des, sciences, showing, that, more, or, less, all, substances, could, be, electrified, by, rubbing, except, for, metals, and, fluids, and, proposed, that, electricity, comes, in, two, varieties, that, cancel, each, other, which, he, expressed, in, terms, of, a, two, fluid, theory, when, glass, was, rubbed, with, silk, du, fay, said, that, the, glass, was, charged, with, vitreous, electricity, and, when, amber, was, rubbed, with, fur, the, amber, was, charged, with, resinous, electricity, in, contemporary, understanding, positive, charge, is, now, defined, as, the, charge, of, a, glass, rod, after, being, rubbed, with, a, silk, cloth, but, it, is, arbitrary, which, type, of, charge, is, called, positive, and, which, is, called, negative, another, important, two, fluid, theory, from, this, time, was, proposed, by, jean, antoine, nollet, 1745, up, until, about, 1745, the, main, explanation, for, electrical, attraction, and, repulsion, was, the, idea, that, electrified, bodies, gave, off, an, effluvium, benjamin, franklin, started, electrical, experiments, in, late, 1746, and, by, 1750, had, developed, a, one, fluid, theory, of, electricity, based, on, an, experiment, that, showed, that, a, rubbed, glass, received, the, same, but, opposite, charge, strength, as, the, cloth, used, to, rub, the, glass, franklin, imagined, electricity, as, being, a, type, of, invisible, fluid, present, in, all, matter, and, coined, the, term, charge, itself, as, well, as, battery, and, some, others, for, example, he, believed, that, it, was, the, glass, in, a, leyden, jar, that, held, the, accumulated, charge, he, posited, that, rubbing, insulating, surfaces, together, caused, this, fluid, to, change, location, and, that, a, flow, of, this, fluid, constitutes, an, electric, current, he, also, posited, that, when, matter, contained, an, excess, of, the, fluid, it, was, positively, charged, and, when, it, had, a, deficit, it, was, negatively, charged, he, identified, the, term, positive, with, vitreous, electricity, and, negative, with, resinous, electricity, after, performing, an, experiment, with, a, glass, tube, he, had, received, from, his, overseas, colleague, peter, collinson, the, experiment, had, participant, a, charge, the, glass, tube, and, participant, b, receive, a, shock, to, the, knuckle, from, the, charged, tube, franklin, identified, participant, b, to, be, positively, charged, after, having, been, shocked, by, the, tube, there, is, some, ambiguity, about, whether, william, watson, independently, arrived, at, the, same, one, fluid, explanation, around, the, same, time, 1747, watson, after, seeing, franklin, s, letter, to, collinson, claims, that, he, had, presented, the, same, explanation, as, franklin, in, spring, 1747, franklin, had, studied, some, of, watson, s, works, prior, to, making, his, own, experiments, and, analysis, which, was, probably, significant, for, franklin, s, own, theorizing, one, physicist, suggests, that, watson, first, proposed, a, one, fluid, theory, which, franklin, then, elaborated, further, and, more, influentially, a, historian, of, science, argues, that, watson, missed, a, subtle, difference, between, his, ideas, and, franklin, s, so, that, watson, misinterpreted, his, ideas, as, being, similar, to, franklin, s, in, any, case, there, was, no, animosity, between, watson, and, franklin, and, the, franklin, model, of, electrical, action, formulated, in, early, 1747, eventually, became, widely, accepted, at, that, time, after, franklin, s, work, effluvia, based, explanations, were, rarely, put, forward, it, is, now, known, that, the, franklin, model, was, fundamentally, correct, there, is, only, one, kind, of, electrical, charge, and, only, one, variable, is, required, to, keep, track, of, the, amount, of, charge, until, 1800, it, was, only, possible, to, study, conduction, of, electric, charge, by, using, an, electrostatic, discharge, in, 1800, alessandro, volta, was, the, first, to, show, that, charge, could, be, maintained, in, continuous, motion, through, a, closed, path, in, 1833, michael, faraday, sought, to, remove, any, doubt, that, electricity, is, identical, regardless, of, the, source, by, which, it, is, produced, he, discussed, a, variety, of, known, forms, which, he, characterized, as, common, electricity, e, g, static, electricity, piezoelectricity, magnetic, induction, voltaic, electricity, e, g, electric, current, from, a, voltaic, pile, and, animal, electricity, e, g, bioelectricity, in, 1838, faraday, raised, a, question, about, whether, electricity, was, a, fluid, or, fluids, or, a, property, of, matter, like, gravity, he, investigated, whether, matter, could, be, charged, with, one, kind, of, charge, independently, of, the, other, he, came, to, the, conclusion, that, electric, charge, was, a, relation, between, two, or, more, bodies, because, he, could, not, charge, one, body, without, having, an, opposite, charge, in, another, body, in, 1838, faraday, also, put, forth, a, theoretical, explanation, of, electric, force, while, expressing, neutrality, about, whether, it, originates, from, one, two, or, no, fluids, he, focused, on, the, idea, that, the, normal, state, of, particles, is, to, be, nonpolarized, and, that, when, polarized, they, seek, to, return, to, their, natural, nonpolarized, state, in, developing, a, field, theory, approach, to, electrodynamics, starting, in, the, mid, 1850s, james, clerk, maxwell, stops, considering, electric, charge, as, a, special, substance, that, accumulates, in, objects, and, starts, to, understand, electric, charge, as, a, consequence, of, the, transformation, of, energy, in, the, field, this, pre, quantum, understanding, considered, magnitude, of, electric, charge, to, be, a, continuous, quantity, even, at, the, microscopic, level, static, electricity, refers, to, the, electric, charge, of, an, object, and, the, related, electrostatic, discharge, when, two, objects, are, brought, together, that, are, not, at, equilibrium, an, electrostatic, discharge, creates, a, change, in, the, charge, of, each, of, the, two, objects, when, a, piece, of, glass, and, a, piece, of, resin, neither, of, which, exhibit, any, electrical, properties, are, rubbed, together, and, left, with, the, rubbed, surfaces, in, contact, they, still, exhibit, no, electrical, properties, when, separated, they, attract, each, other, a, second, piece, of, glass, rubbed, with, a, second, piece, of, resin, then, separated, and, suspended, near, the, former, pieces, of, glass, and, resin, causes, these, phenomena, this, attraction, and, repulsion, is, an, electrical, phenomenon, and, the, bodies, that, exhibit, them, are, said, to, be, electrified, or, electrically, charged, bodies, may, be, electrified, in, many, other, ways, as, well, as, by, sliding, the, electrical, properties, of, the, two, pieces, of, glass, are, similar, to, each, other, but, opposite, to, those, of, the, two, pieces, of, resin, the, glass, attracts, what, the, resin, repels, and, repels, what, the, resin, attracts, if, a, body, electrified, in, any, manner, whatsoever, behaves, as, the, glass, does, that, is, if, it, repels, the, glass, and, attracts, the, resin, the, body, is, said, to, be, vitreously, electrified, and, if, it, attracts, the, glass, and, repels, the, resin, it, is, said, to, be, resinously, electrified, all, electrified, bodies, are, either, vitreously, or, resinously, electrified, an, established, convention, in, the, scientific, community, defines, vitreous, electrification, as, positive, and, resinous, electrification, as, negative, the, exactly, opposite, properties, of, the, two, kinds, of, electrification, justify, our, indicating, them, by, opposite, signs, but, the, application, of, the, positive, sign, to, one, rather, than, to, the, other, kind, must, be, considered, as, a, matter, of, arbitrary, convention, just, as, it, is, a, matter, of, convention, in, mathematical, diagram, to, reckon, positive, distances, towards, the, right, hand, electric, current, is, the, flow, of, electric, charge, through, an, object, the, most, common, charge, carriers, are, the, positively, charged, proton, and, the, negatively, charged, electron, the, movement, of, any, of, these, charged, particles, constitutes, an, electric, current, in, many, situations, it, suffices, to, speak, of, the, conventional, current, without, regard, to, whether, it, is, carried, by, positive, charges, moving, in, the, direction, of, the, conventional, current, or, by, negative, charges, moving, in, the, opposite, direction, this, macroscopic, viewpoint, is, an, approximation, that, simplifies, electromagnetic, concepts, and, calculations, at, the, opposite, extreme, if, one, looks, at, the, microscopic, situation, one, sees, there, are, many, ways, of, carrying, an, electric, current, including, a, flow, of, electrons, a, flow, of, electron, holes, that, act, like, positive, particles, and, both, negative, and, positive, particles, ions, or, other, charged, particles, flowing, in, opposite, directions, in, an, electrolytic, solution, or, a, plasma, beware, that, in, the, common, and, important, case, of, metallic, wires, the, direction, of, the, conventional, current, is, opposite, to, the, drift, velocity, of, the, actual, charge, carriers, i, e, the, electrons, this, is, a, source, of, confusion, for, beginners, the, total, electric, charge, of, an, isolated, system, remains, constant, regardless, of, changes, within, the, system, itself, this, law, is, inherent, to, all, processes, known, to, physics, and, can, be, derived, in, a, local, form, from, gauge, invariance, of, the, wave, function, the, conservation, of, charge, results, in, the, charge, current, continuity, equation, more, generally, the, rate, of, change, in, charge, density, within, a, volume, of, integration, v, is, equal, to, the, area, integral, over, the, current, density, j, through, the, closed, surface, s, v, which, is, in, turn, equal, to, the, net, current, i, thus, the, conservation, of, electric, charge, as, expressed, by, the, continuity, equation, gives, the, result, the, charge, transferred, between, times, t, i, displaystyle, t, mathrm, i, and, t, f, displaystyle, t, mathrm, f, is, obtained, by, integrating, both, sides, where, i, is, the, net, outward, current, through, a, closed, surface, and, q, is, the, electric, charge, contained, within, the, volume, defined, by, the, surface, aside, from, the, properties, described, in, articles, about, electromagnetism, charge, is, a, relativistic, invariant, this, means, that, any, particle, that, has, charge, q, has, the, same, charge, regardless, of, how, fast, it, is, travelling, this, property, has, been, experimentally, verified, by, showing, that, the, charge, of, one, helium, nucleus, two, protons, and, two, neutrons, bound, together, in, a, nucleus, and, moving, around, at, high, speeds, is, the, same, as, two, deuterium, nuclei, one, proton, and, one, neutron, bound, together, but, moving, much, more, slowly, than, they, would, if, they, were, in, a, helium, nucleus
