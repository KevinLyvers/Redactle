in, organic, chemistry, an, alkene, or, olefin, is, a, hydrocarbon, containing, a, carbon, carbon, double, bond, the, double, bond, may, be, internal, or, in, the, terminal, position, terminal, alkenes, are, also, known, as, olefins, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, iupac, recommends, using, the, name, alkene, only, for, acyclic, hydrocarbons, with, just, one, double, bond, alkadiene, alkatriene, etc, or, polyene, for, acyclic, hydrocarbons, with, two, or, more, double, bonds, cycloalkene, cycloalkadiene, etc, for, cyclic, ones, and, olefin, for, the, general, class, cyclic, or, acyclic, with, one, or, more, double, bonds, acyclic, alkenes, with, only, one, double, bond, and, no, other, functional, groups, also, known, as, mono, enes, form, a, homologous, series, of, hydrocarbons, with, the, general, formula, c, n, h, 2, n, with, n, being, a, 1, natural, number, which, is, two, hydrogens, less, than, the, corresponding, alkane, when, n, is, four, or, more, isomers, are, possible, distinguished, by, the, position, and, conformation, of, the, double, bond, alkenes, are, generally, colorless, non, polar, compounds, somewhat, similar, to, alkanes, but, more, reactive, the, first, few, members, of, the, series, are, gases, or, liquids, at, room, temperature, the, simplest, alkene, ethylene, c, 2, h, 4, or, ethene, in, the, iupac, nomenclature, is, the, organic, compound, produced, on, the, largest, scale, industrially, aromatic, compounds, are, often, drawn, as, cyclic, alkenes, however, their, structure, and, properties, are, sufficiently, distinct, that, they, are, not, classified, as, alkenes, or, olefins, hydrocarbons, with, two, overlapping, double, bonds, c, c, c, are, called, allenes, the, simplest, such, compound, is, itself, called, allene, and, those, with, three, or, more, overlapping, bonds, c, c, c, c, c, c, c, c, c, etc, are, called, cumulenes, alkenes, having, four, or, more, carbon, atoms, can, form, diverse, structural, isomers, most, alkenes, are, also, isomers, of, cycloalkanes, acyclic, alkene, structural, isomers, with, only, one, double, bond, follow, many, of, these, molecules, exhibit, cis, trans, isomerism, there, may, also, be, chiral, carbon, atoms, particularly, within, the, larger, molecules, from, c, 5, the, number, of, potential, isomers, increases, rapidly, with, additional, carbon, atoms, a, carbon, carbon, double, bond, consists, of, a, sigma, bond, and, a, pi, bond, this, double, bond, is, stronger, than, a, single, covalent, bond, 611, kj, mol, for, c, c, vs, 347, kj, mol, for, c, c, but, not, twice, as, strong, double, bonds, are, shorter, than, single, bonds, with, an, average, bond, length, of, 1, 33, 133, pm, vs, 1, 53, for, a, typical, c, c, single, bond, each, carbon, atom, of, the, double, bond, uses, its, three, sp, 2, hybrid, orbitals, to, form, sigma, bonds, to, three, atoms, the, other, carbon, atom, and, two, hydrogen, atoms, the, unhybridized, 2p, atomic, orbitals, which, lie, perpendicular, to, the, plane, created, by, the, axes, of, the, three, sp, 2, hybrid, orbitals, combine, to, form, the, pi, bond, this, bond, lies, outside, the, main, c, c, axis, with, half, of, the, bond, on, one, side, of, the, molecule, and, a, half, on, the, other, with, a, strength, of, 65, kcal, mol, the, pi, bond, is, significantly, weaker, than, the, sigma, bond, rotation, about, the, carbon, carbon, double, bond, is, restricted, because, it, incurs, an, energetic, cost, to, break, the, alignment, of, the, p, orbitals, on, the, two, carbon, atoms, consequently, cis, or, trans, isomers, interconvert, so, slowly, that, they, can, be, freely, handled, at, ambient, conditions, without, isomerization, more, complex, alkenes, may, be, named, with, the, e, z, notation, for, molecules, with, three, or, four, different, substituents, side, groups, for, example, of, the, isomers, of, butene, the, two, methyl, groups, of, z, but, 2, ene, a, k, a, cis, 2, butene, appear, on, the, same, side, of, the, double, bond, and, in, e, but, 2, ene, a, k, a, trans, 2, butene, the, methyl, groups, appear, on, opposite, sides, these, two, isomers, of, butene, have, distinct, properties, as, predicted, by, the, vsepr, model, of, electron, pair, repulsion, the, molecular, geometry, of, alkenes, includes, bond, angles, about, each, carbon, atom, in, a, double, bond, of, about, 120, the, angle, may, vary, because, of, steric, strain, introduced, by, nonbonded, interactions, between, functional, groups, attached, to, the, carbon, atoms, of, the, double, bond, for, example, the, c, c, c, bond, angle, in, propylene, is, 123, 9, for, bridged, alkenes, bredt, s, rule, states, that, a, double, bond, cannot, occur, at, the, bridgehead, of, a, bridged, ring, system, unless, the, rings, are, large, enough, following, fawcett, and, defining, s, as, the, total, number, of, non, bridgehead, atoms, in, the, rings, bicyclic, systems, require, s, 7, for, stability, and, tricyclic, systems, require, s, 11, in, organic, chemistry, the, prefixes, cis, and, trans, are, used, to, describe, the, positions, of, functional, groups, attached, to, carbon, atoms, joined, by, a, double, bond, in, latin, cis, and, trans, mean, on, this, side, of, and, on, the, other, side, of, respectively, therefore, if, the, functional, groups, are, both, on, the, same, side, of, the, carbon, chain, the, bond, is, said, to, have, cis, configuration, otherwise, i, e, the, functional, groups, are, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, carbon, chain, the, bond, is, said, to, have, trans, configuration, for, there, to, be, cis, and, trans, configurations, there, must, be, a, carbon, chain, or, at, least, one, functional, group, attached, to, each, carbon, is, the, same, for, both, e, and, z, configuration, can, be, used, instead, in, a, more, general, case, where, all, four, functional, groups, attached, to, carbon, atoms, in, a, double, bond, are, different, e, and, z, are, abbreviations, of, german, words, zusammen, together, and, entgegen, opposite, in, e, and, z, isomerism, each, functional, group, is, assigned, a, priority, based, on, the, cahn, ingold, prelog, priority, rules, if, the, two, groups, with, higher, priority, are, on, the, same, side, of, the, double, bond, the, bond, is, assigned, z, configuration, otherwise, i, e, the, two, groups, with, higher, priority, are, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, double, bond, the, bond, is, assigned, e, configuration, cis, and, trans, configurations, do, not, have, a, fixed, relationship, with, e, and, z, configurations, many, of, the, physical, properties, of, alkenes, and, alkanes, are, similar, they, are, colorless, nonpolar, and, combustible, the, physical, state, depends, on, molecular, mass, like, the, corresponding, saturated, hydrocarbons, the, simplest, alkenes, ethylene, propylene, and, butene, are, gases, at, room, temperature, linear, alkenes, of, approximately, five, to, sixteen, carbon, atoms, are, liquids, and, higher, alkenes, are, waxy, solids, the, melting, point, of, the, solids, also, increases, with, increase, in, molecular, mass, alkenes, generally, have, stronger, smells, than, their, corresponding, alkanes, ethylene, has, a, sweet, and, musty, odor, strained, alkenes, in, particular, like, norbornene, and, trans, cyclooctene, are, known, to, have, strong, unpleasant, odors, a, fact, consistent, with, the, stronger, complexes, they, form, with, metal, ions, including, copper, below, is, a, list, of, the, boiling, and, melting, points, of, various, alkenes, with, the, corresponding, alkane, and, alkyne, analogues, the, stretching, of, c, c, bond, will, give, an, ir, absorption, peak, at, 1670, 1600, cm, 1, while, the, bending, of, c, c, bond, absorbs, between, 1000, and, 650, cm, 1, wavelength, in, 1, h, nmr, spectroscopy, the, hydrogen, bonded, to, the, carbon, adjacent, to, double, bonds, will, give, a, h, of, 4, 5, 6, 5, ppm, the, double, bond, will, also, deshield, the, hydrogen, attached, to, the, carbons, adjacent, to, sp, 2, carbons, and, this, generates, h, 1, 6, 2, ppm, peaks, cis, trans, isomers, are, distinguishable, due, to, different, j, coupling, effect, cis, vicinal, hydrogens, will, have, coupling, constants, in, the, range, of, 6, 14, hz, whereas, the, trans, will, have, coupling, constants, of, 11, 18, hz, in, their, 13, c, nmr, spectra, of, alkenes, double, bonds, also, deshield, the, carbons, making, them, have, low, field, shift, c, c, double, bonds, usually, have, chemical, shift, of, about, 100, 170, ppm, like, most, other, hydrocarbons, alkenes, combust, to, give, carbon, dioxide, and, water, the, combustion, of, alkenes, release, less, energy, than, burning, same, molarity, of, saturated, ones, with, same, number, of, carbons, this, trend, can, be, clearly, seen, in, the, list, of, standard, enthalpy, of, combustion, of, hydrocarbons, alkenes, are, relatively, stable, compounds, but, are, more, reactive, than, alkanes, most, reactions, of, alkenes, involve, additions, to, this, pi, bond, forming, new, single, bonds, alkenes, serve, as, a, feedstock, for, the, petrochemical, industry, because, they, can, participate, in, a, wide, variety, of, reactions, prominently, polymerization, and, alkylation, except, for, ethylene, alkenes, have, two, sites, of, reactivity, the, carbon, carbon, pi, bond, and, the, presence, of, allylic, ch, centers, the, former, dominates, but, the, allylic, sites, are, important, too, hydrogenation, involves, the, addition, of, h, 2, resulting, in, an, alkane, the, equation, of, hydrogenation, of, ethylene, to, form, ethane, is, hydrogenation, reactions, usually, require, catalysts, to, increase, their, reaction, rate, the, total, number, of, hydrogens, that, can, be, added, to, an, unsaturated, hydrocarbon, depends, on, its, degree, of, unsaturation, similar, to, hydrogen, halogens, added, to, double, bonds, halonium, ions, are, intermediates, these, reactions, do, not, require, catalysts, bromine, test, is, used, to, test, the, saturation, of, hydrocarbons, the, bromine, test, can, also, be, used, as, an, indication, of, the, degree, of, unsaturation, for, unsaturated, hydrocarbons, bromine, number, is, defined, as, gram, of, bromine, able, to, react, with, 100g, of, product, similar, as, hydrogenation, the, halogenation, of, bromine, is, also, depend, on, the, number, of, bond, a, higher, bromine, number, indicates, higher, degree, of, unsaturation, the, bonds, of, alkenes, hydrocarbons, are, also, susceptible, to, hydration, the, reaction, usually, involves, strong, acid, as, catalyst, the, first, step, in, hydration, often, involves, formation, of, a, carbocation, the, net, result, of, the, reaction, will, be, an, alcohol, the, reaction, equation, for, hydration, of, ethylene, is, hydrohalogenation, involves, addition, of, h, x, to, unsaturated, hydrocarbons, this, reaction, results, in, new, c, h, and, c, x, bonds, the, formation, of, the, intermediate, carbocation, is, selective, and, follows, markovnikov, s, rule, the, hydrohalogenation, of, alkene, will, result, in, haloalkane, the, reaction, equation, of, hbr, addition, to, ethylene, is, alkenes, add, to, dienes, to, give, cyclohexenes, this, conversion, is, an, example, of, a, diels, alder, reaction, such, reaction, proceed, with, retention, of, stereochemistry, the, rates, are, sensitive, to, electron, withdrawing, or, electron, donating, substituents, when, irradiated, by, uv, light, alkenes, dimerize, to, give, cyclobutanes, another, example, is, the, schenck, ene, reaction, in, which, singlet, oxygen, reacts, with, an, allylic, structure, to, give, a, transposed, allyl, peroxide, alkenes, react, with, percarboxylic, acids, and, even, hydrogen, peroxide, to, yield, epoxides, for, ethylene, the, epoxidation, is, conducted, on, a, very, large, scale, industrially, using, oxygen, in, the, presence, of, silver, based, catalysts, alkenes, react, with, ozone, leading, to, the, scission, of, the, double, bond, the, process, is, called, ozonolysis, often, the, reaction, procedure, includes, a, mild, reductant, such, as, dimethylsulfide, sme, 2, when, treated, with, a, hot, concentrated, acidified, solution, of, kmno, 4, alkenes, are, cleaved, to, form, ketones, and, or, carboxylic, acids, the, stoichiometry, of, the, reaction, is, sensitive, to, conditions, this, reaction, and, the, ozonolysis, can, be, used, to, determine, the, position, of, a, double, bond, in, an, unknown, alkene, the, oxidation, can, be, stopped, at, the, vicinal, diol, rather, than, full, cleavage, of, the, alkene, by, using, osmium, tetroxide, or, other, oxidants, this, reaction, is, called, dihydroxylation, in, the, presence, of, an, appropriate, photosensitiser, such, as, methylene, blue, and, light, alkenes, can, undergo, reaction, with, reactive, oxygen, species, generated, by, the, photosensitiser, such, as, hydroxyl, radicals, singlet, oxygen, or, superoxide, ion, reactions, of, the, excited, sensitizer, can, involve, electron, or, hydrogen, transfer, usually, with, a, reducing, substrate, type, i, reaction, or, interaction, with, oxygen, type, ii, reaction, these, various, alternative, processes, and, reactions, can, be, controlled, by, choice, of, specific, reaction, conditions, leading, to, a, wide, range, of, products, a, common, example, is, the, cycloaddition, of, singlet, oxygen, with, a, diene, such, as, cyclopentadiene, to, yield, an, endoperoxide, terminal, alkenes, are, precursors, to, polymers, via, processes, termed, polymerization, some, polymerizations, are, of, great, economic, significance, as, they, generate, the, plastics, polyethylene, and, polypropylene, polymers, from, alkene, are, usually, referred, to, as, polyolefins, although, they, contain, no, olefins, polymerization, can, proceed, via, diverse, mechanisms, conjugated, dienes, such, as, buta, 1, 3, diene, and, isoprene, 2, methylbuta, 1, 3, diene, also, produce, polymers, one, example, being, natural, rubber, the, presence, of, a, c, c, bond, in, unsaturated, hydrocarbons, weakens, the, dissociation, energy, of, the, allylic, c, h, bonds, thus, these, groupings, are, susceptible, to, free, radical, substitution, at, these, c, h, sites, as, well, as, addition, reactions, at, the, c, c, site, in, the, presence, of, radical, initiators, allylic, c, h, bonds, can, be, halogenated, the, presence, of, two, c, c, bonds, flanking, one, methylene, i, e, doubly, allylic, results, in, particularly, weak, hc, h, bonds, the, high, reactivity, of, these, situations, is, the, basis, for, certain, free, radical, reactions, manifested, in, the, chemistry, of, drying, oils, alkenes, undergo, olefin, metathesis, which, cleaves, and, interchanges, the, substituents, of, the, alkene, a, related, reaction, is, ethenolysis, in, transition, metal, alkene, complexes, alkenes, serve, as, ligands, for, metals, in, this, case, the, electron, density, is, donated, to, the, metal, d, orbitals, the, stronger, the, donation, is, the, stronger, the, back, bonding, from, the, metal, d, orbital, to, anti, bonding, orbital, of, the, alkene, this, effect, lowers, the, bond, order, of, the, alkene, and, increases, the, c, c, bond, length, one, example, is, the, complex, ptcl, 3, c, 2, h, 4, these, complexes, are, related, to, the, mechanisms, of, metal, catalyzed, reactions, of, unsaturated, hydrocarbons, alkenes, are, produced, by, hydrocarbon, cracking, raw, materials, are, mostly, natural, gas, condensate, components, principally, ethane, and, propane, in, the, us, and, mideast, and, naphtha, in, europe, and, asia, alkanes, are, broken, apart, at, high, temperatures, often, in, the, presence, of, a, zeolite, catalyst, to, produce, a, mixture, of, primarily, aliphatic, alkenes, and, lower, molecular, weight, alkanes, the, mixture, is, feedstock, and, temperature, dependent, and, separated, by, fractional, distillation, this, is, mainly, used, for, the, manufacture, of, small, alkenes, up, to, six, carbons, related, to, this, is, catalytic, dehydrogenation, where, an, alkane, loses, hydrogen, at, high, temperatures, to, produce, a, corresponding, alkene, this, is, the, reverse, of, the, catalytic, hydrogenation, of, alkenes, this, process, is, also, known, as, reforming, both, processes, are, endothermic, and, are, driven, towards, the, alkene, at, high, temperatures, by, entropy, catalytic, synthesis, of, higher, alkenes, of, the, type, rch, ch, 2, can, also, be, achieved, by, a, reaction, of, ethylene, with, the, organometallic, compound, triethylaluminium, in, the, presence, of, nickel, cobalt, or, platinum, one, of, the, principal, methods, for, alkene, synthesis, in, the, laboratory, is, the, elimination, reaction, of, alkyl, halides, alcohols, and, similar, compounds, most, common, is, the, elimination, via, the, e2, or, e1, mechanism, a, commercially, significant, example, is, the, production, of, vinyl, chloride, the, e2, mechanism, provides, a, more, reliable, elimination, method, than, e1, for, most, alkene, syntheses, most, e2, eliminations, start, with, an, alkyl, halide, or, alkyl, sulfonate, ester, such, as, a, tosylate, or, triflate, when, an, alkyl, halide, is, used, the, reaction, is, called, a, dehydrohalogenation, for, unsymmetrical, products, the, more, substituted, alkenes, those, with, fewer, hydrogens, attached, to, the, c, c, tend, to, predominate, see, zaitsev, s, rule, two, common, methods, of, elimination, reactions, are, dehydrohalogenation, of, alkyl, halides, and, dehydration, of, alcohols, a, typical, example, is, shown, below, note, that, if, possible, the, h, is, anti, to, the, leaving, group, even, though, this, leads, to, the, less, stable, z, isomer, alkenes, can, be, synthesized, from, alcohols, via, dehydration, in, which, case, water, is, lost, via, the, e1, mechanism, for, example, the, dehydration, of, ethanol, produces, ethylene, an, alcohol, may, also, be, converted, to, a, better, leaving, group, e, g, xanthate, so, as, to, allow, a, milder, syn, elimination, such, as, the, chugaev, elimination, and, the, grieco, elimination, related, reactions, include, eliminations, by, haloethers, the, boord, olefin, synthesis, and, esters, ester, pyrolysis, a, thioketone, and, a, phosphite, ester, combined, the, corey, winter, olefination, or, diphosphorus, tetraiodide, will, deoxygenate, glycols, to, alkenes, alkenes, can, be, prepared, indirectly, from, alkyl, amines, the, amine, or, ammonia, is, not, a, suitable, leaving, group, so, the, amine, is, first, either, alkylated, as, in, the, hofmann, elimination, or, oxidized, to, an, amine, oxide, the, cope, reaction, to, render, a, smooth, elimination, possible, the, cope, reaction, is, a, syn, elimination, that, occurs, at, or, below, 150, c, for, example, the, hofmann, elimination, is, unusual, in, that, the, less, substituted, non, zaitsev, alkene, is, usually, the, major, product, alkenes, are, generated, from, halo, sulfones, in, the, ramberg, b, cklund, reaction, via, a, three, membered, ring, sulfone, intermediate, another, important, class, of, methods, for, alkene, synthesis, involves, construction, of, a, new, carbon, carbon, double, bond, by, coupling, or, condensation, of, a, carbonyl, compound, such, as, an, aldehyde, or, ketone, to, a, carbanion, or, its, equivalent, pre, eminent, is, the, aldol, condensation, knoevenagel, condensations, are, a, related, class, of, reactions, that, convert, carbonyls, into, alkenes, well, known, methods, are, called, olefinations, the, wittig, reaction, is, illustrative, but, other, related, methods, are, known, including, the, horner, wadsworth, emmons, reaction, the, wittig, reaction, involves, reaction, of, an, aldehyde, or, ketone, with, a, wittig, reagent, or, phosphorane, of, the, type, ph, 3, p, chr, to, produce, an, alkene, and, ph, 3, p, o, the, wittig, reagent, is, itself, prepared, easily, from, triphenylphosphine, and, an, alkyl, halide, related, to, the, wittig, reaction, is, the, peterson, olefination, which, uses, silicon, based, reagents, in, place, of, the, phosphorane, this, reaction, allows, for, the, selection, of, e, or, z, products, if, an, e, product, is, desired, another, alternative, is, the, julia, olefination, which, uses, the, carbanion, generated, from, a, phenyl, sulfone, the, takai, olefination, based, on, an, organochromium, intermediate, also, delivers, e, products, a, titanium, compound, tebbe, s, reagent, is, useful, for, the, synthesis, of, methylene, compounds, in, this, case, even, esters, and, amides, react, a, pair, of, ketones, or, aldehydes, can, be, deoxygenated, to, generate, an, alkene, symmetrical, alkenes, can, be, prepared, from, a, single, aldehyde, or, ketone, coupling, with, itself, using, titanium, metal, reduction, the, mcmurry, reaction, if, different, ketones, are, to, be, coupled, a, more, complicated, method, is, required, such, as, the, barton, kellogg, reaction, a, single, ketone, can, also, be, converted, to, the, corresponding, alkene, via, its, tosylhydrazone, using, sodium, methoxide, the, bamford, stevens, reaction, or, an, alkyllithium, the, shapiro, reaction, the, formation, of, longer, alkenes, via, the, step, wise, polymerisation, of, smaller, ones, is, appealing, as, ethylene, the, smallest, alkene, is, both, inexpensive, and, readily, available, with, hundreds, of, millions, of, tonnes, produced, annually, the, ziegler, natta, process, allows, for, the, formation, of, very, long, chains, for, instance, those, used, for, polyethylene, where, shorter, chains, are, wanted, as, they, for, the, production, of, surfactants, then, processes, incorporating, a, olefin, metathesis, step, such, as, the, shell, higher, olefin, process, are, important, olefin, metathesis, is, also, used, commercially, for, the, interconversion, of, ethylene, and, 2, butene, to, propylene, rhenium, and, molybdenum, containing, heterogeneous, catalysis, are, used, in, this, process, transition, metal, catalyzed, hydrovinylation, is, another, important, alkene, synthesis, process, starting, from, alkene, itself, it, involves, the, addition, of, a, hydrogen, and, a, vinyl, group, or, an, alkenyl, group, across, a, double, bond, reduction, of, alkynes, is, a, useful, method, for, the, stereoselective, synthesis, of, disubstituted, alkenes, if, the, cis, alkene, is, desired, hydrogenation, in, the, presence, of, lindlar, s, catalyst, a, heterogeneous, catalyst, that, consists, of, palladium, deposited, on, calcium, carbonate, and, treated, with, various, forms, of, lead, is, commonly, used, though, hydroboration, followed, by, hydrolysis, provides, an, alternative, approach, reduction, of, the, alkyne, by, sodium, metal, in, liquid, ammonia, gives, the, trans, alkene, for, the, preparation, multisubstituted, alkenes, carbometalation, of, alkynes, can, give, rise, to, a, large, variety, of, alkene, derivatives, alkenes, can, be, synthesized, from, other, alkenes, via, rearrangement, reactions, besides, olefin, metathesis, described, above, many, pericyclic, reactions, can, be, used, such, as, the, ene, reaction, and, the, cope, rearrangement, in, the, diels, alder, reaction, a, cyclohexene, derivative, is, prepared, from, a, diene, and, a, reactive, or, electron, deficient, alkene, unsaturated, hydrocarbons, are, widely, used, to, produce, plastics, medicines, and, other, useful, materials, alkenes, are, prevalent, in, nature, plants, are, the, main, natural, source, of, alkenes, in, the, form, of, terpenes, many, of, the, most, vivid, natural, pigments, are, terpenes, e, g, lycopene, red, in, tomatoes, carotene, orange, in, carrots, and, xanthophylls, yellow, in, egg, yolk, the, simplest, of, all, alkenes, ethylene, is, a, signaling, molecule, that, influences, the, ripening, of, plants, although, the, nomenclature, is, not, followed, widely, according, to, iupac, an, alkene, is, an, acyclic, hydrocarbon, with, just, one, double, bond, between, carbon, atoms, olefins, comprise, a, larger, collection, of, cyclic, and, acyclic, alkenes, as, well, as, dienes, and, polyenes, to, form, the, root, of, the, iupac, names, for, straight, chain, alkenes, change, the, an, infix, of, the, parent, to, en, for, example, ch, 3, ch, 3, is, the, alkane, ethane, the, name, of, ch, 2, ch, 2, is, therefore, ethene, for, straight, chain, alkenes, with, 4, or, more, carbon, atoms, that, name, does, not, completely, identify, the, compound, for, those, cases, and, for, branched, acyclic, alkenes, the, following, rules, apply, the, position, of, the, double, bond, is, often, inserted, before, the, name, of, the, chain, e, g, 2, pentene, rather, than, before, the, suffix, pent, 2, ene, the, positions, need, not, be, indicated, if, they, are, unique, note, that, the, double, bond, may, imply, a, different, chain, numbering, than, that, used, for, the, corresponding, alkane, h, 3, c, 3, c, ch, 2, ch, 3, is, 2, 2, dimethyl, pentane, whereas, h, 3, c, 3, c, ch, ch, 2, is, 3, 3, dimethyl, 1, pentene, more, complex, rules, apply, for, polyenes, and, cycloalkenes, if, the, double, bond, of, an, acyclic, mono, ene, is, not, the, first, bond, of, the, chain, the, name, as, constructed, above, still, does, not, completely, identify, the, compound, because, of, cis, trans, isomerism, then, one, must, specify, whether, the, two, single, c, c, bonds, adjacent, to, the, double, bond, are, on, the, same, side, of, its, plane, or, on, opposite, sides, for, monoalkenes, the, configuration, is, often, indicated, by, the, prefixes, cis, from, latin, on, this, side, of, or, trans, across, on, the, other, side, of, before, the, name, respectively, as, in, cis, 2, pentene, or, trans, 2, butene, more, generally, cis, trans, isomerism, will, exist, if, each, of, the, two, carbons, of, in, the, double, bond, has, two, different, atoms, or, groups, attached, to, it, accounting, for, these, cases, the, iupac, recommends, the, more, general, e, z, notation, instead, of, the, cis, and, trans, prefixes, this, notation, considers, the, group, with, highest, cip, priority, in, each, of, the, two, carbons, if, these, two, groups, are, on, opposite, sides, of, the, double, bond, s, plane, the, configuration, is, labeled, e, from, the, german, entgegen, meaning, opposite, if, they, are, on, the, same, side, it, is, labeled, z, from, german, zusammen, together, this, labeling, may, be, taught, with, mnemonic, z, means, on, ze, zame, zide, iupac, recognizes, two, names, for, hydrocarbon, groups, containing, carbon, carbon, double, bonds, the, vinyl, group, and, the, allyl, group
