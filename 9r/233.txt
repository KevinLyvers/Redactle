https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet
an, exoplanet, or, extrasolar, planet, is, a, planet, outside, the, solar, system, the, first, possible, evidence, of, an, exoplanet, was, noted, in, 1917, but, was, not, then, recognized, as, such, the, first, confirmation, of, the, detection, occurred, in, 1992, a, different, planet, first, detected, in, 1988, was, confirmed, in, 2003, according, to, statistics, from, the, nasa, exoplanet, archive, as, of, 6, september, 2024, there, are, 5, 756, confirmed, exoplanets, in, 4, 297, planetary, systems, with, 963, systems, having, more, than, one, planet, the, james, webb, space, telescope, jwst, is, expected, to, discover, more, exoplanets, and, to, give, more, insight, into, their, traits, such, as, their, composition, environmental, conditions, and, potential, for, life, there, are, many, methods, of, detecting, exoplanets, transit, photometry, and, doppler, spectroscopy, have, found, the, most, but, these, methods, suffer, from, a, clear, observational, bias, favoring, the, detection, of, planets, near, the, star, thus, 85, of, the, exoplanets, detected, are, inside, the, tidal, locking, zone, in, several, cases, multiple, planets, have, been, observed, around, a, star, about, 1, in, 5, sun, like, stars, have, an, earth, sized, planet, in, the, habitable, zone, assuming, there, are, 200, billion, stars, in, the, milky, way, it, can, be, hypothesized, that, there, are, 11, billion, potentially, habitable, earth, sized, planets, in, the, milky, way, rising, to, 40, billion, if, planets, orbiting, the, numerous, red, dwarfs, are, included, the, least, massive, exoplanet, known, is, draugr, also, known, as, psr, b1257, 12, a, or, psr, b1257, 12, b, which, is, about, twice, the, mass, of, the, moon, the, most, massive, exoplanet, listed, on, the, nasa, exoplanet, archive, is, hr, 2562, b, about, 30, times, the, mass, of, jupiter, however, according, to, some, definitions, of, a, planet, based, on, the, nuclear, fusion, of, deuterium, it, is, too, massive, to, be, a, planet, and, might, be, a, brown, dwarf, instead, known, orbital, times, for, exoplanets, vary, from, less, than, an, hour, for, those, closest, to, their, star, to, thousands, of, years, some, exoplanets, are, so, far, away, from, the, star, that, it, is, difficult, to, tell, whether, they, are, gravitationally, bound, to, it, almost, all, planets, detected, so, far, are, within, the, milky, way, however, there, is, evidence, that, extragalactic, planets, exoplanets, located, in, other, galaxies, may, exist, the, nearest, exoplanets, are, located, 4, 2, light, years, 1, 3, parsecs, from, earth, and, orbit, proxima, centauri, the, closest, star, to, the, sun, the, discovery, of, exoplanets, has, intensified, interest, in, the, search, for, extraterrestrial, life, there, is, special, interest, in, planets, that, orbit, in, a, star, s, habitable, zone, sometimes, called, goldilocks, zone, where, it, is, possible, for, liquid, water, a, prerequisite, for, life, as, we, know, it, to, exist, on, the, surface, however, the, study, of, planetary, habitability, also, considers, a, wide, range, of, other, factors, in, determining, the, suitability, of, a, planet, for, hosting, life, rogue, planets, are, those, that, do, not, orbit, any, star, such, objects, are, considered, a, separate, category, of, planets, especially, if, they, are, gas, giants, often, counted, as, sub, brown, dwarfs, the, rogue, planets, in, the, milky, way, possibly, number, in, the, billions, or, more, the, official, definition, of, the, term, planet, used, by, the, international, astronomical, union, iau, only, covers, the, solar, system, and, thus, does, not, apply, to, exoplanets, the, iau, working, group, on, extrasolar, planets, issued, a, position, statement, containing, a, working, definition, of, planet, in, 2001, and, which, was, modified, in, 2003, an, exoplanet, was, defined, by, the, following, criteria, this, working, definition, was, amended, by, the, iau, s, commission, f2, exoplanets, and, the, solar, system, in, august, 2018, the, official, working, definition, of, an, exoplanet, is, now, as, follows, the, iau, s, working, definition, is, not, always, used, one, alternate, suggestion, is, that, planets, should, be, distinguished, from, brown, dwarfs, on, the, basis, of, their, formation, it, is, widely, thought, that, giant, planets, form, through, core, accretion, which, may, sometimes, produce, planets, with, masses, above, the, deuterium, fusion, threshold, massive, planets, of, that, sort, may, have, already, been, observed, brown, dwarfs, form, like, stars, from, the, direct, gravitational, collapse, of, clouds, of, gas, and, this, formation, mechanism, also, produces, objects, that, are, below, the, 13, m, jup, limit, and, can, be, as, low, as, 1, m, jup, objects, in, this, mass, range, that, orbit, their, stars, with, wide, separations, of, hundreds, or, thousands, of, au, and, have, large, star, object, mass, ratios, likely, formed, as, brown, dwarfs, their, atmospheres, would, likely, have, a, composition, more, similar, to, their, host, star, than, accretion, formed, planets, which, would, contain, increased, abundances, of, heavier, elements, most, directly, imaged, planets, as, of, april, 2014, are, massive, and, have, wide, orbits, so, probably, represent, the, low, mass, end, of, a, brown, dwarf, formation, one, study, suggests, that, objects, above, 10, m, jup, formed, through, gravitational, instability, and, should, not, be, thought, of, as, planets, also, the, 13, jupiter, mass, cutoff, does, not, have, a, precise, physical, significance, deuterium, fusion, can, occur, in, some, objects, with, a, mass, below, that, cutoff, the, amount, of, deuterium, fused, depends, to, some, extent, on, the, composition, of, the, object, as, of, 2011, the, extrasolar, planets, encyclopaedia, included, objects, up, to, 25, jupiter, masses, saying, the, fact, that, there, is, no, special, feature, around, 13, m, jup, in, the, observed, mass, spectrum, reinforces, the, choice, to, forget, this, mass, limit, as, of, 2016, this, limit, was, increased, to, 60, jupiter, masses, based, on, a, study, of, mass, density, relationships, the, exoplanet, data, explorer, includes, objects, up, to, 24, jupiter, masses, with, the, advisory, the, 13, jupiter, mass, distinction, by, the, iau, working, group, is, physically, unmotivated, for, planets, with, rocky, cores, and, observationally, problematic, due, to, the, sin, i, ambiguity, the, nasa, exoplanet, archive, includes, objects, with, a, mass, or, minimum, mass, equal, to, or, less, than, 30, jupiter, masses, another, criterion, for, separating, planets, and, brown, dwarfs, rather, than, deuterium, fusion, formation, process, or, location, is, whether, the, core, pressure, is, dominated, by, coulomb, pressure, or, electron, degeneracy, pressure, with, the, dividing, line, at, around, 5, jupiter, masses, the, convention, for, naming, exoplanets, is, an, extension, of, the, system, used, for, designating, multiple, star, systems, as, adopted, by, the, international, astronomical, union, iau, for, exoplanets, orbiting, a, single, star, the, iau, designation, is, formed, by, taking, the, designated, or, proper, name, of, its, parent, star, and, adding, a, lower, case, letter, letters, are, given, in, order, of, each, planet, s, discovery, around, the, parent, star, so, that, the, first, planet, discovered, in, a, system, is, designated, b, the, parent, star, is, considered, a, and, later, planets, are, given, subsequent, letters, if, several, planets, in, the, same, system, are, discovered, at, the, same, time, the, closest, one, to, the, star, gets, the, next, letter, followed, by, the, other, planets, in, order, of, orbital, size, a, provisional, iau, sanctioned, standard, exists, to, accommodate, the, designation, of, circumbinary, planets, a, limited, number, of, exoplanets, have, iau, sanctioned, proper, names, other, naming, systems, exist, for, centuries, scientists, philosophers, and, science, fiction, writers, suspected, that, extrasolar, planets, existed, but, there, was, no, way, of, knowing, whether, they, were, real, in, fact, how, common, they, were, or, how, similar, they, might, be, to, the, planets, of, the, solar, system, various, detection, claims, made, in, the, nineteenth, century, were, rejected, by, astronomers, the, first, evidence, of, a, possible, exoplanet, orbiting, van, maanen, 2, was, noted, in, 1917, but, was, not, recognized, as, such, the, astronomer, walter, sydney, adams, who, later, became, director, of, the, mount, wilson, observatory, produced, a, spectrum, of, the, star, using, mount, wilson, s, 60, inch, telescope, he, interpreted, the, spectrum, to, be, of, an, f, type, main, sequence, star, but, it, is, now, thought, that, such, a, spectrum, could, be, caused, by, the, residue, of, a, nearby, exoplanet, that, had, been, pulverized, by, the, gravity, of, the, star, the, resulting, dust, then, falling, onto, the, star, the, first, suspected, scientific, detection, of, an, exoplanet, occurred, in, 1988, shortly, afterwards, the, first, confirmation, of, detection, came, in, 1992, from, the, arecibo, observatory, with, the, discovery, of, several, terrestrial, mass, planets, orbiting, the, pulsar, psr, b1257, 12, the, first, confirmation, of, an, exoplanet, orbiting, a, main, sequence, star, was, made, in, 1995, when, a, giant, planet, was, found, in, a, four, day, orbit, around, the, nearby, star, 51, pegasi, some, exoplanets, have, been, imaged, directly, by, telescopes, but, the, vast, majority, have, been, detected, through, indirect, methods, such, as, the, transit, method, and, the, radial, velocity, method, in, february, 2018, researchers, using, the, chandra, x, ray, observatory, combined, with, a, planet, detection, technique, called, microlensing, found, evidence, of, planets, in, a, distant, galaxy, stating, some, of, these, exoplanets, are, as, relatively, small, as, the, moon, while, others, are, as, massive, as, jupiter, unlike, earth, most, of, the, exoplanets, are, not, tightly, bound, to, stars, so, they, re, actually, wandering, through, space, or, loosely, orbiting, between, stars, we, can, estimate, that, the, number, of, planets, in, this, galaxy, is, more, than, a, trillion, on, 21, march, 2022, the, 5000th, exoplanet, beyond, the, solar, system, was, confirmed, on, 11, january, 2023, nasa, scientists, reported, the, detection, of, lhs, 475, b, an, earth, like, exoplanet, and, the, first, exoplanet, discovered, by, the, james, webb, space, telescope, this, space, we, declare, to, be, infinite, in, it, are, an, infinity, of, worlds, of, the, same, kind, as, our, own, in, the, sixteenth, century, the, italian, philosopher, giordano, bruno, an, early, supporter, of, the, copernican, theory, that, earth, and, other, planets, orbit, the, sun, heliocentrism, put, forward, the, view, that, fixed, stars, are, similar, to, the, sun, and, are, likewise, accompanied, by, planets, in, the, eighteenth, century, the, same, possibility, was, mentioned, by, isaac, newton, in, the, general, scholium, that, concludes, his, principia, making, a, comparison, to, the, sun, s, planets, he, wrote, and, if, the, fixed, stars, are, the, centres, of, similar, systems, they, will, all, be, constructed, according, to, a, similar, design, and, subject, to, the, dominion, of, one, in, 1952, more, than, 40, years, before, the, first, hot, jupiter, was, discovered, otto, struve, wrote, that, there, is, no, compelling, reason, that, planets, could, not, be, much, closer, to, their, parent, star, than, is, the, case, in, the, solar, system, and, proposed, that, doppler, spectroscopy, and, the, transit, method, could, detect, super, jupiters, in, short, orbits, claims, of, exoplanet, detections, have, been, made, since, the, nineteenth, century, some, of, the, earliest, involve, the, binary, star, 70, ophiuchi, in, 1855, william, stephen, jacob, at, the, east, india, company, s, madras, observatory, reported, that, orbital, anomalies, made, it, highly, probable, that, there, was, a, planetary, body, in, this, system, in, the, 1890s, thomas, j, j, see, of, the, university, of, chicago, and, the, united, states, naval, observatory, stated, that, the, orbital, anomalies, proved, the, existence, of, a, dark, body, in, the, 70, ophiuchi, system, with, a, 36, year, period, around, one, of, the, stars, however, forest, ray, moulton, published, a, paper, proving, that, a, three, body, system, with, those, orbital, parameters, would, be, highly, unstable, during, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, peter, van, de, kamp, of, swarthmore, college, made, another, prominent, series, of, detection, claims, this, time, for, planets, orbiting, barnard, s, star, astronomers, now, generally, regard, all, early, reports, of, detection, as, erroneous, in, 1991, andrew, lyne, m, bailes, and, s, l, shemar, claimed, to, have, discovered, a, pulsar, planet, in, orbit, around, psr, 1829, 10, using, pulsar, timing, variations, the, claim, briefly, received, intense, attention, but, lyne, and, his, team, soon, retracted, it, as, of, 24, july, 2024, a, total, of, 5, 756, confirmed, exoplanets, are, listed, in, the, nasa, exoplanet, archive, including, a, few, that, were, confirmations, of, controversial, claims, from, the, late, 1980s, the, first, published, discovery, to, receive, subsequent, confirmation, was, made, in, 1988, by, the, canadian, astronomers, bruce, campbell, g, a, h, walker, and, stephenson, yang, of, the, university, of, victoria, and, the, university, of, british, columbia, although, they, were, cautious, about, claiming, a, planetary, detection, their, radial, velocity, observations, suggested, that, a, planet, orbits, the, star, gamma, cephei, partly, because, the, observations, were, at, the, very, limits, of, instrumental, capabilities, at, the, time, astronomers, remained, skeptical, for, several, years, about, this, and, other, similar, observations, it, was, thought, some, of, the, apparent, planets, might, instead, have, been, brown, dwarfs, objects, intermediate, in, mass, between, planets, and, stars, in, 1990, additional, observations, were, published, that, supported, the, existence, of, the, planet, orbiting, gamma, cephei, but, subsequent, work, in, 1992, again, raised, serious, doubts, finally, in, 2003, improved, techniques, allowed, the, planet, s, existence, to, be, confirmed, on, 9, january, 1992, radio, astronomers, aleksander, wolszczan, and, dale, frail, announced, the, discovery, of, two, planets, orbiting, the, pulsar, psr, 1257, 12, this, discovery, was, confirmed, and, is, generally, considered, to, be, the, first, definitive, detection, of, exoplanets, follow, up, observations, solidified, these, results, and, confirmation, of, a, third, planet, in, 1994, revived, the, topic, in, the, popular, press, these, pulsar, planets, are, thought, to, have, formed, from, the, unusual, remnants, of, the, supernova, that, produced, the, pulsar, in, a, second, round, of, planet, formation, or, else, to, be, the, remaining, rocky, cores, of, gas, giants, that, somehow, survived, the, supernova, and, then, decayed, into, their, current, orbits, as, pulsars, are, aggressive, stars, it, was, considered, unlikely, at, the, time, that, a, planet, may, be, able, to, be, formed, in, their, orbit, in, the, early, 1990s, a, group, of, astronomers, led, by, donald, backer, who, were, studying, what, they, thought, was, a, binary, pulsar, psr, b1620, 26, b, determined, that, a, third, object, was, needed, to, explain, the, observed, doppler, shifts, within, a, few, years, the, gravitational, effects, of, the, planet, on, the, orbit, of, the, pulsar, and, white, dwarf, had, been, measured, giving, an, estimate, of, the, mass, of, the, third, object, that, was, too, small, for, it, to, be, a, star, the, conclusion, that, the, third, object, was, a, planet, was, announced, by, stephen, thorsett, and, his, collaborators, in, 1993, on, 6, october, 1995, michel, mayor, and, didier, queloz, of, the, university, of, geneva, announced, the, first, definitive, detection, of, an, exoplanet, orbiting, a, main, sequence, star, nearby, g, type, star, 51, pegasi, this, discovery, made, at, the, observatoire, de, haute, provence, ushered, in, the, modern, era, of, exoplanetary, discovery, and, was, recognized, by, a, share, of, the, 2019, nobel, prize, in, physics, technological, advances, most, notably, in, high, resolution, spectroscopy, led, to, the, rapid, detection, of, many, new, exoplanets, astronomers, could, detect, exoplanets, indirectly, by, measuring, their, gravitational, influence, on, the, motion, of, their, host, stars, more, extrasolar, planets, were, later, detected, by, observing, the, variation, in, a, star, s, apparent, luminosity, as, an, orbiting, planet, transited, in, front, of, it, initially, the, most, known, exoplanets, were, massive, planets, that, orbited, very, close, to, their, parent, stars, astronomers, were, surprised, by, these, hot, jupiters, because, theories, of, planetary, formation, had, indicated, that, giant, planets, should, only, form, at, large, distances, from, stars, but, eventually, more, planets, of, other, sorts, were, found, and, it, is, now, clear, that, hot, jupiters, make, up, the, minority, of, exoplanets, in, 1999, upsilon, andromedae, became, the, first, main, sequence, star, known, to, have, multiple, planets, kepler, 16, contains, the, first, discovered, planet, that, orbits, a, binary, main, sequence, star, system, on, 26, february, 2014, nasa, announced, the, discovery, of, 715, newly, verified, exoplanets, around, 305, stars, by, the, kepler, space, telescope, these, exoplanets, were, checked, using, a, statistical, technique, called, verification, by, multiplicity, before, these, results, most, confirmed, planets, were, gas, giants, comparable, in, size, to, jupiter, or, larger, because, they, were, more, easily, detected, but, the, kepler, planets, are, mostly, between, the, size, of, neptune, and, the, size, of, earth, on, 23, july, 2015, nasa, announced, kepler, 452b, a, near, earth, size, planet, orbiting, the, habitable, zone, of, a, g2, type, star, on, 6, september, 2018, nasa, discovered, an, exoplanet, about, 145, light, years, away, from, earth, in, the, constellation, virgo, this, exoplanet, wolf, 503b, is, twice, the, size, of, earth, and, was, discovered, orbiting, a, type, of, star, known, as, an, orange, dwarf, wolf, 503b, completes, one, orbit, in, as, few, as, six, days, because, it, is, very, close, to, the, star, wolf, 503b, is, the, only, exoplanet, that, large, that, can, be, found, near, the, so, called, small, planet, radius, gap, the, gap, sometimes, called, the, fulton, gap, is, the, observation, that, it, is, unusual, to, find, exoplanets, with, sizes, between, 1, 5, and, 2, times, the, radius, of, the, earth, in, january, 2020, scientists, announced, the, discovery, of, toi, 700, d, the, first, earth, sized, planet, in, the, habitable, zone, detected, by, tess, as, of, january, 2020, nasa, s, kepler, and, tess, missions, had, identified, 4374, planetary, candidates, yet, to, be, confirmed, several, of, them, being, nearly, earth, sized, and, located, in, the, habitable, zone, some, around, sun, like, stars, in, september, 2020, astronomers, reported, evidence, for, the, first, time, of, an, extragalactic, planet, m51, uls, 1b, detected, by, eclipsing, a, bright, x, ray, source, xrs, in, the, whirlpool, galaxy, m51a, also, in, september, 2020, astronomers, using, microlensing, techniques, reported, the, detection, for, the, first, time, of, an, earth, mass, rogue, planet, unbounded, by, any, star, and, free, floating, in, the, milky, way, galaxy, planets, are, extremely, faint, compared, to, their, parent, stars, for, example, a, sun, like, star, is, about, a, billion, times, brighter, than, the, reflected, light, from, any, exoplanet, orbiting, it, it, is, difficult, to, detect, such, a, faint, light, source, and, furthermore, the, parent, star, causes, a, glare, that, tends, to, wash, it, out, it, is, necessary, to, block, the, light, from, the, parent, star, to, reduce, the, glare, while, leaving, the, light, from, the, planet, detectable, doing, so, is, a, major, technical, challenge, which, requires, extreme, optothermal, stability, all, exoplanets, that, have, been, directly, imaged, are, both, large, more, massive, than, jupiter, and, widely, separated, from, their, parent, stars, specially, designed, direct, imaging, instruments, such, as, gemini, planet, imager, vlt, sphere, and, scexao, will, image, dozens, of, gas, giants, but, the, vast, majority, of, known, extrasolar, planets, have, only, been, detected, through, indirect, methods, planets, may, form, within, a, few, to, tens, or, more, of, millions, of, years, of, their, star, forming, the, planets, of, the, solar, system, can, only, be, observed, in, their, current, state, but, observations, of, different, planetary, systems, of, varying, ages, allows, us, to, observe, planets, at, different, stages, of, evolution, available, observations, range, from, young, proto, planetary, disks, where, planets, are, still, forming, to, planetary, systems, of, over, 10, gyr, old, when, planets, form, in, a, gaseous, protoplanetary, disk, they, accrete, hydrogen, helium, envelopes, these, envelopes, cool, and, contract, over, time, and, depending, on, the, mass, of, the, planet, some, or, all, of, the, hydrogen, helium, is, eventually, lost, to, space, this, means, that, even, terrestrial, planets, may, start, off, with, large, radii, if, they, form, early, enough, an, example, is, kepler, 51b, which, has, only, about, twice, the, mass, of, earth, but, is, almost, the, size, of, saturn, which, is, a, hundred, times, the, mass, of, earth, kepler, 51b, is, quite, young, at, a, few, hundred, million, years, old, there, is, at, least, one, planet, on, average, per, star, about, 1, in, 5, sun, like, stars, have, an, earth, sized, planet, in, the, habitable, zone, most, known, exoplanets, orbit, stars, roughly, similar, to, the, sun, i, e, main, sequence, stars, of, spectral, categories, f, g, or, k, lower, mass, stars, red, dwarfs, of, spectral, category, m, are, less, likely, to, have, planets, massive, enough, to, be, detected, by, the, radial, velocity, method, despite, this, several, tens, of, planets, around, red, dwarfs, have, been, discovered, by, the, kepler, space, telescope, which, uses, the, transit, method, to, detect, smaller, planets, using, data, from, kepler, a, correlation, has, been, found, between, the, metallicity, of, a, star, and, the, probability, that, the, star, hosts, a, giant, planet, similar, to, the, size, of, jupiter, stars, with, higher, metallicity, are, more, likely, to, have, planets, especially, giant, planets, than, stars, with, lower, metallicity, some, planets, orbit, one, member, of, a, binary, star, system, and, several, circumbinary, planets, have, been, discovered, which, orbit, both, members, of, a, binary, star, a, few, planets, in, triple, star, systems, are, known, and, one, in, the, quadruple, system, kepler, 64, in, 2013, the, color, of, an, exoplanet, was, determined, for, the, first, time, the, best, fit, albedo, measurements, of, hd, 189733b, suggest, that, it, is, deep, dark, blue, later, that, same, year, the, colors, of, several, other, exoplanets, were, determined, including, gj, 504, b, which, visually, has, a, magenta, color, and, kappa, andromedae, b, which, if, seen, up, close, would, appear, reddish, in, color, helium, planets, are, expected, to, be, white, or, grey, in, appearance, the, apparent, brightness, apparent, magnitude, of, a, planet, depends, on, how, far, away, the, observer, is, how, reflective, the, planet, is, albedo, and, how, much, light, the, planet, receives, from, its, star, which, depends, on, how, far, the, planet, is, from, the, star, and, how, bright, the, star, is, so, a, planet, with, a, low, albedo, that, is, close, to, its, star, can, appear, brighter, than, a, planet, with, a, high, albedo, that, is, far, from, the, star, the, darkest, known, planet, in, terms, of, geometric, albedo, is, tres, 2b, a, hot, jupiter, that, reflects, less, than, 1, of, the, light, from, its, star, making, it, less, reflective, than, coal, or, black, acrylic, paint, hot, jupiters, are, expected, to, be, quite, dark, due, to, sodium, and, potassium, in, their, atmospheres, but, it, is, not, known, why, tres, 2b, is, so, dark, it, could, be, due, to, an, unknown, chemical, compound, for, gas, giants, geometric, albedo, generally, decreases, with, increasing, metallicity, or, atmospheric, temperature, unless, there, are, clouds, to, modify, this, effect, increased, cloud, column, depth, increases, the, albedo, at, optical, wavelengths, but, decreases, it, at, some, infrared, wavelengths, optical, albedo, increases, with, age, because, older, planets, have, higher, cloud, column, depths, optical, albedo, decreases, with, increasing, mass, because, higher, mass, giant, planets, have, higher, surface, gravities, which, produces, lower, cloud, column, depths, also, elliptical, orbits, can, cause, major, fluctuations, in, atmospheric, composition, which, can, have, a, significant, effect, there, is, more, thermal, emission, than, reflection, at, some, near, infrared, wavelengths, for, massive, and, or, young, gas, giants, so, although, optical, brightness, is, fully, phase, dependent, this, is, not, always, the, case, in, the, near, infrared, temperatures, of, gas, giants, reduce, over, time, and, with, distance, from, their, stars, lowering, the, temperature, increases, optical, albedo, even, without, clouds, at, a, sufficiently, low, temperature, water, clouds, form, which, further, increase, optical, albedo, at, even, lower, temperatures, ammonia, clouds, form, resulting, in, the, highest, albedos, at, most, optical, and, near, infrared, wavelengths, in, 2014, a, magnetic, field, around, hd, 209458, b, was, inferred, from, the, way, hydrogen, was, evaporating, from, the, planet, it, is, the, first, indirect, detection, of, a, magnetic, field, on, an, exoplanet, the, magnetic, field, is, estimated, to, be, about, one, tenth, as, strong, as, jupiter, s, the, magnetic, fields, of, exoplanets, are, thought, to, be, detectable, by, their, auroral, radio, emissions, with, sensitive, low, frequency, radio, telescopes, such, as, lofar, although, they, have, yet, to, be, found, the, radio, emissions, could, measure, the, rotation, rate, of, the, interior, of, an, exoplanet, and, may, yield, a, more, accurate, way, to, measure, exoplanet, rotation, than, by, examining, the, motion, of, clouds, however, the, most, sensitive, radio, search, for, auroral, emissions, thus, far, from, nine, exoplanets, with, arecibo, also, did, not, result, in, any, discoveries, earth, s, magnetic, field, results, from, its, flowing, liquid, metallic, core, but, on, massive, super, earths, with, high, pressure, different, compounds, may, form, which, do, not, match, those, created, under, terrestrial, conditions, compounds, may, form, with, greater, viscosities, and, high, melting, temperatures, which, could, prevent, the, interiors, from, separating, into, different, layers, and, so, result, in, undifferentiated, coreless, mantles, forms, of, magnesium, oxide, such, as, mgsi, 3, o, 12, could, be, a, liquid, metal, at, the, pressures, and, temperatures, found, in, super, earths, and, could, generate, a, magnetic, field, in, the, mantles, of, super, earths, hot, jupiters, have, been, observed, to, have, a, larger, radius, than, expected, this, could, be, caused, by, the, interaction, between, the, stellar, wind, and, the, planet, s, magnetosphere, creating, an, electric, current, through, the, planet, that, heats, it, up, joule, heating, causing, it, to, expand, the, more, magnetically, active, a, star, is, the, greater, the, stellar, wind, and, the, larger, the, electric, current, leading, to, more, heating, and, expansion, of, the, planet, this, theory, matches, the, observation, that, stellar, activity, is, correlated, with, inflated, planetary, radii, in, august, 2018, scientists, announced, the, transformation, of, gaseous, deuterium, into, a, liquid, metallic, hydrogen, form, this, may, help, researchers, better, understand, giant, gas, planets, such, as, jupiter, saturn, and, related, exoplanets, since, such, planets, are, thought, to, contain, a, lot, of, liquid, metallic, hydrogen, which, may, be, responsible, for, their, observed, powerful, magnetic, fields, although, scientists, previously, announced, that, the, magnetic, fields, of, close, in, exoplanets, may, cause, increased, stellar, flares, and, starspots, on, their, host, stars, in, 2019, this, claim, was, demonstrated, to, be, false, in, the, hd, 189733, system, the, failure, to, detect, star, planet, interactions, in, the, well, studied, hd, 189733, system, calls, other, related, claims, of, the, effect, into, question, a, later, search, for, radio, emissions, from, eight, exoplanets, that, orbit, within, 0, 1, astronomical, units, of, their, host, stars, conducted, by, the, arecibo, radio, telescope, also, failed, to, find, signs, of, these, magnetic, star, planet, interactions, in, 2019, the, strength, of, the, surface, magnetic, fields, of, 4, hot, jupiters, were, estimated, and, ranged, between, 20, and, 120, gauss, compared, to, jupiter, s, surface, magnetic, field, of, 4, 3, gauss, in, 2007, two, independent, teams, of, researchers, came, to, opposing, conclusions, about, the, likelihood, of, plate, tectonics, on, larger, super, earths, with, one, team, saying, that, plate, tectonics, would, be, episodic, or, stagnant, and, the, other, team, saying, that, plate, tectonics, is, very, likely, on, super, earths, even, if, the, planet, is, dry, if, super, earths, have, more, than, 80, times, as, much, water, as, earth, then, they, become, ocean, planets, with, all, land, completely, submerged, however, if, there, is, less, water, than, this, limit, then, the, deep, water, cycle, will, move, enough, water, between, the, oceans, and, mantle, to, allow, continents, to, exist, large, surface, temperature, variations, on, 55, cancri, e, have, been, attributed, to, possible, volcanic, activity, releasing, large, clouds, of, dust, which, blanket, the, planet, and, block, thermal, emissions, the, star, 1swasp, j140747, 93, 394542, 6, was, occulted, by, an, object, that, is, circled, by, a, ring, system, much, larger, than, saturn, s, rings, however, the, mass, of, the, object, is, not, known, it, could, be, a, brown, dwarf, or, low, mass, star, instead, of, a, planet, the, brightness, of, optical, images, of, fomalhaut, b, could, be, due, to, starlight, reflecting, off, a, circumplanetary, ring, system, with, a, radius, between, 20, and, 40, times, that, of, jupiter, s, radius, about, the, size, of, the, orbits, of, the, galilean, moons, the, rings, of, the, solar, system, s, gas, giants, are, aligned, with, their, planet, s, equator, however, for, exoplanets, that, orbit, close, to, their, star, tidal, forces, from, the, star, would, lead, to, the, outermost, rings, of, a, planet, being, aligned, with, the, planet, s, orbital, plane, around, the, star, a, planet, s, innermost, rings, would, still, be, aligned, with, the, planet, s, equator, so, that, if, the, planet, has, a, tilted, rotational, axis, then, the, different, alignments, between, the, inner, and, outer, rings, would, create, a, warped, ring, system, in, december, 2013, a, candidate, exomoon, of, the, rogue, planet, or, red, dwarf, moa, 2011, blg, 262l, was, announced, on, 3, october, 2018, evidence, suggesting, a, large, exomoon, orbiting, kepler, 1625b, was, reported, atmospheres, have, been, detected, around, several, exoplanets, the, first, to, be, observed, was, hd, 209458, b, in, 2001, as, of, february, 2014, more, than, fifty, transiting, and, five, directly, imaged, exoplanet, atmospheres, have, been, observed, resulting, in, detection, of, molecular, spectral, features, observation, of, day, night, temperature, gradients, and, constraints, on, vertical, atmospheric, structure, also, an, atmosphere, has, been, detected, on, the, non, transiting, hot, jupiter, tau, bo, tis, b, in, may, 2017, glints, of, light, from, earth, seen, as, twinkling, from, an, orbiting, satellite, a, million, miles, away, were, found, to, be, reflected, light, from, ice, crystals, in, the, atmosphere, the, technology, used, to, determine, this, may, be, useful, in, studying, the, atmospheres, of, distant, worlds, including, those, of, exoplanets, kic, 12557548, b, is, a, small, rocky, planet, very, close, to, its, star, that, is, evaporating, and, leaving, a, trailing, tail, of, cloud, and, dust, like, a, comet, the, dust, could, be, ash, erupting, from, volcanos, and, escaping, due, to, the, small, planet, s, low, surface, gravity, or, it, could, be, from, metals, that, are, vaporized, by, the, high, temperatures, of, being, so, close, to, the, star, with, the, metal, vapor, then, condensing, into, dust, in, june, 2015, scientists, reported, that, the, atmosphere, of, gj, 436, b, was, evaporating, resulting, in, a, giant, cloud, around, the, planet, and, due, to, radiation, from, the, host, star, a, long, trailing, tail, 14, million, km, 9, million, mi, long, tidally, locked, planets, in, a, 1, 1, spin, orbit, resonance, would, have, their, star, always, shining, directly, overhead, on, one, spot, which, would, be, hot, with, the, opposite, hemisphere, receiving, no, light, and, being, freezing, cold, such, a, planet, could, resemble, an, eyeball, with, the, hotspot, being, the, pupil, planets, with, an, eccentric, orbit, could, be, locked, in, other, resonances, 3, 2, and, 5, 2, resonances, would, result, in, a, double, eyeball, pattern, with, hotspots, in, both, eastern, and, western, hemispheres, planets, with, both, an, eccentric, orbit, and, a, tilted, axis, of, rotation, would, have, more, complicated, insolation, patterns, surface, features, can, be, distinguished, from, atmospheric, features, by, comparing, emission, and, reflection, spectroscopy, with, transmission, spectroscopy, mid, infrared, spectroscopy, of, exoplanets, may, detect, rocky, surfaces, and, near, infrared, may, identify, magma, oceans, or, high, temperature, lavas, hydrated, silicate, surfaces, and, water, ice, giving, an, unambiguous, method, to, distinguish, between, rocky, and, gaseous, exoplanets, measuring, the, intensity, of, the, light, it, receives, from, its, parent, star, can, estimate, the, temperature, of, an, exoplanet, for, example, the, planet, ogle, 2005, blg, 390lb, is, estimated, to, have, a, surface, temperature, of, roughly, 220, c, 50, k, however, such, estimates, may, be, substantially, in, error, because, they, depend, on, the, planet, s, usually, unknown, albedo, and, because, factors, such, as, the, greenhouse, effect, may, introduce, unknown, complications, a, few, planets, have, had, their, temperature, measured, by, observing, the, variation, in, infrared, radiation, as, the, planet, moves, around, in, its, orbit, and, is, eclipsed, by, its, parent, star, for, example, the, planet, hd, 189733b, has, been, estimated, to, have, an, average, temperature, of, 1, 205, k, 932, c, on, its, dayside, and, 973, k, 700, c, on, its, nightside, as, more, planets, are, discovered, the, field, of, exoplanetology, continues, to, grow, into, a, deeper, study, of, extrasolar, worlds, and, will, ultimately, tackle, the, prospect, of, life, on, planets, beyond, the, solar, system, at, cosmic, distances, life, can, only, be, detected, if, it, is, developed, at, a, planetary, scale, and, strongly, modified, the, planetary, environment, in, such, a, way, that, the, modifications, cannot, be, explained, by, classical, physico, chemical, processes, out, of, equilibrium, processes, for, example, molecular, oxygen, o, 2, in, the, atmosphere, of, earth, is, a, result, of, photosynthesis, by, living, plants, and, many, kinds, of, microorganisms, so, it, can, be, used, as, an, indication, of, life, on, exoplanets, although, small, amounts, of, oxygen, could, also, be, produced, by, non, biological, means, furthermore, a, potentially, habitable, planet, must, orbit, a, stable, star, at, a, distance, within, which, planetary, mass, objects, with, sufficient, atmospheric, pressure, can, support, liquid, water, at, their, surfaces, the, habitable, zone, around, a, star, is, the, region, where, the, temperature, is, just, right, to, allow, liquid, water, to, exist, on, the, surface, of, a, planet, that, is, not, too, close, to, the, star, for, the, water, to, evaporate, and, not, too, far, away, from, the, star, for, the, water, to, freeze, the, heat, produced, by, stars, varies, depending, on, the, size, and, age, of, the, star, so, that, the, habitable, zone, can, be, at, different, distances, for, different, stars, also, the, atmospheric, conditions, on, the, planet, influence, the, planet, s, ability, to, retain, heat, so, that, the, location, of, the, habitable, zone, is, also, specific, to, each, type, of, planet, desert, planets, also, known, as, dry, planets, with, very, little, water, will, have, less, water, vapor, in, the, atmosphere, than, earth, and, so, have, a, reduced, greenhouse, effect, meaning, that, a, desert, planet, could, maintain, oases, of, water, closer, to, its, star, than, earth, is, to, the, sun, the, lack, of, water, also, means, there, is, less, ice, to, reflect, heat, into, space, so, the, outer, edge, of, desert, planet, habitable, zones, is, further, out, rocky, planets, with, a, thick, hydrogen, atmosphere, could, maintain, surface, water, much, further, out, than, the, earth, sun, distance, planets, with, larger, mass, have, wider, habitable, zones, because, gravity, reduces, the, water, cloud, column, depth, which, reduces, the, greenhouse, effect, of, water, vapor, thus, moving, the, inner, edge, of, the, habitable, zone, closer, to, the, star, planetary, rotation, rate, is, one, of, the, major, factors, determining, the, circulation, of, the, atmosphere, and, hence, the, pattern, of, clouds, slowly, rotating, planets, create, thick, clouds, that, reflect, more, and, so, can, be, habitable, much, closer, to, their, star, earth, with, its, current, atmosphere, would, be, habitable, in, venus, s, orbit, if, it, had, venus, s, slow, rotation, if, venus, lost, its, water, ocean, due, to, a, runaway, greenhouse, effect, it, is, likely, to, have, had, a, higher, rotation, rate, in, the, past, alternatively, venus, never, had, an, ocean, because, water, vapor, was, lost, to, space, during, its, formation, and, could, have, had, its, slow, rotation, throughout, its, history, tidally, locked, planets, a, k, a, eyeball, planets, can, be, habitable, closer, to, their, star, than, previously, thought, due, to, the, effect, of, clouds, at, high, stellar, flux, strong, convection, produces, thick, water, clouds, near, the, substellar, point, that, greatly, increase, the, planetary, albedo, and, reduce, surface, temperatures, planets, in, the, habitable, zones, of, stars, with, low, metallicity, are, more, habitable, for, complex, life, on, land, than, high, metallicity, stars, because, the, stellar, spectrum, of, high, metallicity, stars, is, less, likely, to, cause, the, formation, of, ozone, thus, enabling, more, ultraviolet, rays, to, reach, the, planet, s, surface, habitable, zones, have, usually, been, defined, in, terms, of, surface, temperature, however, over, half, of, earth, s, biomass, is, from, subsurface, microbes, and, the, temperature, increases, with, depth, so, the, subsurface, can, be, conducive, for, microbial, life, when, the, surface, is, frozen, and, if, this, is, considered, the, habitable, zone, extends, much, further, from, the, star, even, rogue, planets, could, have, liquid, water, at, sufficient, depths, underground, in, an, earlier, era, of, the, universe, the, temperature, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, would, have, allowed, any, rocky, planets, that, existed, to, have, liquid, water, on, their, surface, regardless, of, their, distance, from, a, star, jupiter, like, planets, might, not, be, habitable, but, they, could, have, habitable, moons, the, outer, edge, of, the, habitable, zone, is, where, planets, are, completely, frozen, but, planets, well, inside, the, habitable, zone, can, periodically, become, frozen, if, orbital, fluctuations, or, other, causes, produce, cooling, then, this, creates, more, ice, but, ice, reflects, sunlight, causing, even, more, cooling, creating, a, feedback, loop, until, the, planet, is, completely, or, nearly, completely, frozen, when, the, surface, is, frozen, this, stops, carbon, dioxide, weathering, resulting, in, a, build, up, of, carbon, dioxide, in, the, atmosphere, from, volcanic, emissions, this, creates, a, greenhouse, effect, which, thaws, the, planet, again, planets, with, a, large, axial, tilt, are, less, likely, to, enter, snowball, states, and, can, retain, liquid, water, further, from, their, star, large, fluctuations, of, axial, tilt, can, have, even, more, of, a, warming, effect, than, a, fixed, large, tilt, paradoxically, planets, orbiting, cooler, stars, such, as, red, dwarfs, are, less, likely, to, enter, snowball, states, because, the, infrared, radiation, emitted, by, cooler, stars, is, mostly, at, wavelengths, that, are, absorbed, by, ice, which, heats, it, up, if, a, planet, has, an, eccentric, orbit, then, tidal, heating, can, provide, another, source, of, energy, besides, stellar, radiation, this, means, that, eccentric, planets, in, the, radiative, habitable, zone, can, be, too, hot, for, liquid, water, tides, also, circularize, orbits, over, time, so, there, could, be, planets, in, the, habitable, zone, with, circular, orbits, that, have, no, water, because, they, used, to, have, eccentric, orbits, eccentric, planets, further, out, than, the, habitable, zone, would, still, have, frozen, surfaces, but, the, tidal, heating, could, create, a, subsurface, ocean, similar, to, europa, s, in, some, planetary, systems, such, as, in, the, upsilon, andromedae, system, the, eccentricity, of, orbits, is, maintained, or, even, periodically, varied, by, perturbations, from, other, planets, in, the, system, tidal, heating, can, cause, outgassing, from, the, mantle, contributing, to, the, formation, and, replenishment, of, an, atmosphere, a, review, in, 2015, identified, exoplanets, kepler, 62f, kepler, 186f, and, kepler, 442b, as, the, best, candidates, for, being, potentially, habitable, these, are, at, a, distance, of, 1200, 490, and, 1, 120, light, years, away, respectively, of, these, kepler, 186f, is, in, similar, size, to, earth, with, its, 1, 2, earth, radius, measure, and, it, is, located, towards, the, outer, edge, of, the, habitable, zone, around, its, red, dwarf, star, when, looking, at, the, nearest, terrestrial, exoplanet, candidates, proxima, centauri, b, is, about, 4, 2, light, years, away, its, equilibrium, temperature, is, estimated, to, be, 39, c, 234, k, exoplanets, are, often, members, of, planetary, systems, of, multiple, planets, around, a, star, the, planets, interact, with, each, other, gravitationally, and, sometimes, form, resonant, systems, where, the, orbital, periods, of, the, planets, are, in, integer, ratios, the, kepler, 223, system, contains, four, planets, in, an, 8, 6, 4, 3, orbital, resonance, some, hot, jupiters, orbit, their, stars, in, the, opposite, direction, to, their, stars, rotation, one, proposed, explanation, is, that, hot, jupiters, tend, to, form, in, dense, clusters, where, perturbations, are, more, common, and, gravitational, capture, of, planets, by, neighboring, stars, is, possible
