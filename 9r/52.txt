the, knot, n, t, is, a, unit, of, speed, equal, to, one, nautical, mile, per, hour, exactly, 1, 852, km, h, approximately, 1, 151, mph, or, 0, 514, m, s, the, iso, standard, symbol, for, the, knot, is, kn, the, same, symbol, is, preferred, by, the, institute, of, electrical, and, electronics, engineers, ieee, while, kt, is, also, common, especially, in, aviation, where, it, is, the, form, recommended, by, the, international, civil, aviation, organization, icao, the, knot, is, a, non, si, unit, the, knot, is, used, in, meteorology, and, in, maritime, and, air, navigation, a, vessel, travelling, at, 1, knot, along, a, meridian, travels, approximately, one, minute, of, geographic, latitude, in, one, hour, the, length, of, the, internationally, agreed, nautical, mile, is, 1, 852, m, the, us, adopted, the, international, definition, in, 1954, having, previously, used, the, us, nautical, mile, 1, 853, 248, m, the, uk, adopted, the, international, nautical, mile, definition, in, 1970, having, previously, used, the, uk, admiralty, nautical, mile, 6, 080, ft, or, 1, 853, 184, m, approximate, values, the, speeds, of, vessels, relative, to, the, fluids, in, which, they, travel, boat, speeds, and, air, speeds, are, measured, in, knots, for, consistency, the, speeds, of, navigational, fluids, ocean, currents, tidal, streams, river, currents, and, wind, speeds, are, also, measured, in, knots, thus, speed, over, the, ground, sog, ground, speed, gs, in, aircraft, and, rate, of, progress, towards, a, distant, point, velocity, made, good, vmg, are, also, given, in, knots, until, the, mid, 19th, century, vessel, speed, at, sea, was, measured, using, a, chip, log, this, consisted, of, a, wooden, panel, attached, by, line, to, a, reel, and, weighted, on, one, edge, to, float, perpendicularly, to, the, water, surface, and, thus, present, substantial, resistance, to, the, water, moving, around, it, the, chip, log, was, cast, over, the, stern, of, the, moving, vessel, and, the, line, allowed, to, pay, out, knots, tied, at, a, distance, of, 47, feet, 3, inches, 14, 4018, m, from, each, other, passed, through, a, sailor, s, fingers, while, another, sailor, used, a, 30, second, sand, glass, 28, second, sand, glass, is, the, currently, accepted, timing, to, time, the, operation, the, knot, count, would, be, reported, and, used, in, the, sailing, master, s, dead, reckoning, and, navigation, this, method, gives, a, value, for, the, knot, of, 20, 25, in, s, or, 1, 85166, km, h, the, difference, from, the, modern, definition, is, less, than, 0, 02, derivation, of, knots, spacing, 1, kn, 1852, m, h, 0, 5144, m, s, displaystyle, 1, textrm, kn, 1852, textrm, m, h, 0, 5144, textrm, m, s, so, in, 28, displaystyle, 28, seconds, that, is, 14, 40, displaystyle, 14, 40, metres, per, knot, although, the, unit, knot, does, not, fit, within, the, si, system, its, retention, for, nautical, and, aviation, use, is, important, because, the, length, of, a, nautical, mile, upon, which, the, knot, is, based, is, closely, related, to, the, longitude, latitude, geographic, coordinate, system, as, a, result, nautical, miles, and, knots, are, convenient, units, to, use, when, navigating, an, aircraft, or, ship, on, a, standard, nautical, chart, using, mercator, projection, the, horizontal, east, west, scale, varies, with, latitude, on, a, chart, of, the, north, atlantic, the, scale, varies, by, a, factor, of, two, from, florida, to, greenland, a, single, graphic, scale, of, the, sort, on, many, maps, would, therefore, be, useless, on, such, a, chart, since, the, length, of, a, nautical, mile, for, practical, purposes, is, equivalent, to, about, a, minute, of, latitude, a, distance, in, nautical, miles, on, a, chart, can, easily, be, measured, by, using, dividers, and, the, latitude, scales, on, the, sides, of, the, chart, recent, british, admiralty, charts, have, a, latitude, scale, down, the, middle, to, make, this, even, easier, speed, is, sometimes, incorrectly, expressed, as, knots, per, hour, which, would, mean, nautical, miles, per, hour, per, hour, and, thus, would, refer, to, acceleration, prior, to, 1969, airworthiness, standards, for, civil, aircraft, in, the, united, states, federal, aviation, regulations, specified, that, distances, were, to, be, in, statute, miles, and, speeds, in, miles, per, hour, in, 1969, these, standards, were, progressively, amended, to, specify, that, distances, were, to, be, in, nautical, miles, and, speeds, in, knots, the, following, abbreviations, are, used, to, distinguish, between, various, measurements, of, airspeed, the, indicated, airspeed, is, close, to, the, true, airspeed, only, at, sea, level, in, standard, conditions, and, at, low, speeds, at, 11, 000, m, 36, 000, ft, an, indicated, airspeed, of, 300, kn, may, correspond, to, a, true, airspeed, of, 500, kn, in, standard, conditions
