absolute, zero, is, the, lowest, limit, of, the, thermodynamic, temperature, scale, a, state, at, which, the, enthalpy, and, entropy, of, a, cooled, ideal, gas, reach, their, minimum, value, the, fundamental, particles, of, nature, have, minimum, vibrational, motion, retaining, only, quantum, mechanical, zero, point, energy, induced, particle, motion, the, theoretical, temperature, is, determined, by, extrapolating, the, ideal, gas, law, by, international, agreement, absolute, zero, is, taken, as, 0, kelvin, international, system, of, units, which, is, 273, 15, degrees, on, the, celsius, scale, and, equals, 459, 67, degrees, on, the, fahrenheit, scale, united, states, customary, units, or, imperial, units, the, kelvin, and, rankine, temperature, scales, set, their, zero, points, at, absolute, zero, by, definition, it, is, commonly, thought, of, as, the, lowest, temperature, possible, but, it, is, not, the, lowest, enthalpy, state, possible, because, all, real, substances, begin, to, depart, from, the, ideal, gas, when, cooled, as, they, approach, the, change, of, state, to, liquid, and, then, to, solid, and, the, sum, of, the, enthalpy, of, vaporization, gas, to, liquid, and, enthalpy, of, fusion, liquid, to, solid, exceeds, the, ideal, gas, s, change, in, enthalpy, to, absolute, zero, in, the, quantum, mechanical, description, matter, at, absolute, zero, is, in, its, ground, state, the, point, of, lowest, internal, energy, the, laws, of, thermodynamics, indicate, that, absolute, zero, cannot, be, reached, using, only, thermodynamic, means, because, the, temperature, of, the, substance, being, cooled, approaches, the, temperature, of, the, cooling, agent, asymptotically, even, a, system, at, absolute, zero, if, it, could, somehow, be, achieved, would, still, possess, quantum, mechanical, zero, point, energy, the, energy, of, its, ground, state, at, absolute, zero, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, ground, state, cannot, be, removed, scientists, and, technologists, routinely, achieve, temperatures, close, to, absolute, zero, where, matter, exhibits, quantum, effects, such, as, superconductivity, superfluidity, and, bose, einstein, condensation, at, temperatures, near, 0, k, 273, 15, c, 459, 67, f, nearly, all, molecular, motion, ceases, and, s, 0, for, any, adiabatic, process, where, s, is, the, entropy, in, such, a, circumstance, pure, substances, can, ideally, form, perfect, crystals, with, no, structural, imperfections, as, t, 0, max, planck, s, strong, form, of, the, third, law, of, thermodynamics, states, the, entropy, of, a, perfect, crystal, vanishes, at, absolute, zero, the, original, nernst, heat, theorem, makes, the, weaker, and, less, controversial, claim, that, the, entropy, change, for, any, isothermal, process, approaches, zero, as, t, 0, the, implication, is, that, the, entropy, of, a, perfect, crystal, approaches, a, constant, value, an, adiabat, is, a, state, with, constant, entropy, typically, represented, on, a, graph, as, a, curve, in, a, manner, similar, to, isotherms, and, isobars, the, nernst, postulate, identifies, the, isotherm, t, 0, as, coincident, with, the, adiabat, s, 0, although, other, isotherms, and, adiabats, are, distinct, as, no, two, adiabats, intersect, no, other, adiabat, can, intersect, the, t, 0, isotherm, consequently, no, adiabatic, process, initiated, at, nonzero, temperature, can, lead, to, zero, temperature, callen, pp, 189, 190, a, perfect, crystal, is, one, in, which, the, internal, lattice, structure, extends, uninterrupted, in, all, directions, the, perfect, order, can, be, represented, by, translational, symmetry, along, three, not, usually, orthogonal, axes, every, lattice, element, of, the, structure, is, in, its, proper, place, whether, it, is, a, single, atom, or, a, molecular, grouping, for, substances, that, exist, in, two, or, more, stable, crystalline, forms, such, as, diamond, and, graphite, for, carbon, there, is, a, kind, of, chemical, degeneracy, the, question, remains, whether, both, can, have, zero, entropy, at, t, 0, even, though, each, is, perfectly, ordered, perfect, crystals, never, occur, in, practice, imperfections, and, even, entire, amorphous, material, inclusions, can, and, do, get, frozen, in, at, low, temperatures, so, transitions, to, more, stable, states, do, not, occur, using, the, debye, model, the, specific, heat, and, entropy, of, a, pure, crystal, are, proportional, to, t, 3, while, the, enthalpy, and, chemical, potential, are, proportional, to, t, 4, guggenheim, p, 111, these, quantities, drop, toward, their, t, 0, limiting, values, and, approach, with, zero, slopes, for, the, specific, heats, at, least, the, limiting, value, itself, is, definitely, zero, as, borne, out, by, experiments, to, below, 10, k, even, the, less, detailed, einstein, model, shows, this, curious, drop, in, specific, heats, in, fact, all, specific, heats, vanish, at, absolute, zero, not, just, those, of, crystals, likewise, for, the, coefficient, of, thermal, expansion, maxwell, s, relations, show, that, various, other, quantities, also, vanish, these, phenomena, were, unanticipated, since, the, relation, between, changes, in, gibbs, free, energy, g, the, enthalpy, h, and, the, entropy, is, thus, as, t, decreases, g, and, h, approach, each, other, so, long, as, s, is, bounded, experimentally, it, is, found, that, all, spontaneous, processes, including, chemical, reactions, result, in, a, decrease, in, g, as, they, proceed, toward, equilibrium, if, s, and, or, t, are, small, the, condition, g, 0, may, imply, that, h, 0, which, would, indicate, an, exothermic, reaction, however, this, is, not, required, endothermic, reactions, can, proceed, spontaneously, if, the, t, s, term, is, large, enough, moreover, the, slopes, of, the, derivatives, of, g, and, h, converge, and, are, equal, to, zero, at, t, 0, this, ensures, that, g, and, h, are, nearly, the, same, over, a, considerable, range, of, temperatures, and, justifies, the, approximate, empirical, principle, of, thomsen, and, berthelot, which, states, that, the, equilibrium, state, to, which, a, system, proceeds, is, the, one, that, evolves, the, greatest, amount, of, heat, i, e, an, actual, process, is, the, most, exothermic, one, callen, pp, 186, 187, one, model, that, estimates, the, properties, of, an, electron, gas, at, absolute, zero, in, metals, is, the, fermi, gas, the, electrons, being, fermions, must, be, in, different, quantum, states, which, leads, the, electrons, to, get, very, high, typical, velocities, even, at, absolute, zero, the, maximum, energy, that, electrons, can, have, at, absolute, zero, is, called, the, fermi, energy, the, fermi, temperature, is, defined, as, this, maximum, energy, divided, by, the, boltzmann, constant, and, is, on, the, order, of, 80, 000, k, for, typical, electron, densities, found, in, metals, for, temperatures, significantly, below, the, fermi, temperature, the, electrons, behave, in, almost, the, same, way, as, at, absolute, zero, this, explains, the, failure, of, the, classical, equipartition, theorem, for, metals, that, eluded, classical, physicists, in, the, late, 19th, century, a, bose, einstein, condensate, bec, is, a, state, of, matter, of, a, dilute, gas, of, weakly, interacting, bosons, confined, in, an, external, potential, and, cooled, to, temperatures, very, near, absolute, zero, under, such, conditions, a, large, fraction, of, the, bosons, occupy, the, lowest, quantum, state, of, the, external, potential, at, which, point, quantum, effects, become, apparent, on, a, macroscopic, scale, this, state, of, matter, was, first, predicted, by, satyendra, nath, bose, and, albert, einstein, in, 1924, 25, bose, first, sent, a, paper, to, einstein, on, the, quantum, statistics, of, light, quanta, now, called, photons, einstein, was, impressed, translated, the, paper, from, english, to, german, and, submitted, it, for, bose, to, the, zeitschrift, f, r, physik, which, published, it, einstein, then, extended, bose, s, ideas, to, material, particles, or, matter, in, two, other, papers, seventy, years, later, in, 1995, the, first, gaseous, condensate, was, produced, by, eric, cornell, and, carl, wieman, at, the, university, of, colorado, at, boulder, nist, jila, lab, using, a, gas, of, rubidium, atoms, cooled, to, 170, nanokelvin, nk, 1, 7, 10, 7, k, in, 2003, researchers, at, the, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, mit, achieved, a, temperature, of, 450, 80, picokelvin, pk, 4, 5, 10, 10, k, in, a, bec, of, sodium, atoms, the, associated, black, body, peak, emittance, wavelength, of, 6, 4, megameters, is, roughly, the, radius, of, earth, in, 2021, university, of, bremen, physicists, achieved, a, bec, with, a, temperature, of, only, 38, pk, the, current, coldest, temperature, record, absolute, or, thermodynamic, temperature, is, conventionally, measured, in, kelvin, celsius, scaled, increments, and, in, the, rankine, scale, fahrenheit, scaled, increments, with, increasing, rarity, absolute, temperature, measurement, is, uniquely, determined, by, a, multiplicative, constant, which, specifies, the, size, of, the, degree, so, the, ratios, of, two, absolute, temperatures, t, 2, t, 1, are, the, same, in, all, scales, the, most, transparent, definition, of, this, standard, comes, from, the, maxwell, boltzmann, distribution, it, can, also, be, found, in, fermi, dirac, statistics, for, particles, of, half, integer, spin, and, bose, einstein, statistics, for, particles, of, integer, spin, all, of, these, define, the, relative, numbers, of, particles, in, a, system, as, decreasing, exponential, functions, of, energy, at, the, particle, level, over, kt, with, k, representing, the, boltzmann, constant, and, t, representing, the, temperature, observed, at, the, macroscopic, level, temperatures, that, are, expressed, as, negative, numbers, on, the, familiar, celsius, or, fahrenheit, scales, are, simply, colder, than, the, zero, points, of, those, scales, certain, systems, can, achieve, truly, negative, temperatures, that, is, their, thermodynamic, temperature, expressed, in, kelvins, can, be, of, a, negative, quantity, a, system, with, a, truly, negative, temperature, is, not, colder, than, absolute, zero, rather, a, system, with, a, negative, temperature, is, hotter, than, any, system, with, a, positive, temperature, in, the, sense, that, if, a, negative, temperature, system, and, a, positive, temperature, system, come, in, contact, heat, flows, from, the, negative, to, the, positive, temperature, system, most, familiar, systems, cannot, achieve, negative, temperatures, because, adding, energy, always, increases, their, entropy, however, some, systems, have, a, maximum, amount, of, energy, that, they, can, hold, and, as, they, approach, that, maximum, energy, their, entropy, actually, begins, to, decrease, because, temperature, is, defined, by, the, relationship, between, energy, and, entropy, such, a, system, s, temperature, becomes, negative, even, though, energy, is, being, added, as, a, result, the, boltzmann, factor, for, states, of, systems, at, negative, temperature, increases, rather, than, decreases, with, increasing, state, energy, therefore, no, complete, system, i, e, including, the, electromagnetic, modes, can, have, negative, temperatures, since, there, is, no, highest, energy, state, so, that, the, sum, of, the, probabilities, of, the, states, would, diverge, for, negative, temperatures, however, for, quasi, equilibrium, systems, e, g, spins, out, of, equilibrium, with, the, electromagnetic, field, this, argument, does, not, apply, and, negative, effective, temperatures, are, attainable, on, 3, january, 2013, physicists, announced, that, for, the, first, time, they, had, created, a, quantum, gas, made, up, of, potassium, atoms, with, a, negative, temperature, in, motional, degrees, of, freedom, one, of, the, first, to, discuss, the, possibility, of, an, absolute, minimal, temperature, was, robert, boyle, his, 1665, new, experiments, and, observations, touching, cold, articulated, the, dispute, known, as, the, primum, frigidum, the, concept, was, well, known, among, naturalists, of, the, time, some, contended, an, absolute, minimum, temperature, occurred, within, earth, as, one, of, the, four, classical, elements, others, within, water, others, air, and, some, more, recently, within, nitre, but, all, of, them, seemed, to, agree, that, there, is, some, body, or, other, that, is, of, its, own, nature, supremely, cold, and, by, participation, of, which, all, other, bodies, obtain, that, quality, the, question, of, whether, there, is, a, limit, to, the, degree, of, coldness, possible, and, if, so, where, the, zero, must, be, placed, was, first, addressed, by, the, french, physicist, guillaume, amontons, in, 1703, in, connection, with, his, improvements, in, the, air, thermometer, his, instrument, indicated, temperatures, by, the, height, at, which, a, certain, mass, of, air, sustained, a, column, of, mercury, the, pressure, or, spring, of, the, air, varying, with, temperature, amontons, therefore, argued, that, the, zero, of, his, thermometer, would, be, that, temperature, at, which, the, spring, of, the, air, was, reduced, to, nothing, he, used, a, scale, that, marked, the, boiling, point, of, water, at, 73, and, the, melting, point, of, ice, at, 51, 1, 2, so, that, the, zero, was, equivalent, to, about, 240, on, the, celsius, scale, amontons, held, that, the, absolute, zero, cannot, be, reached, so, never, attempted, to, compute, it, explicitly, the, value, of, 240, c, or, 431, divisions, below, the, cold, of, freezing, water, was, published, by, george, martine, in, 1740, this, close, approximation, to, the, modern, value, of, 273, 15, c, for, the, zero, of, the, air, thermometer, was, further, improved, upon, in, 1779, by, johann, heinrich, lambert, who, observed, that, 270, c, 454, 00, f, 3, 15, k, might, be, regarded, as, absolute, cold, values, of, this, order, for, the, absolute, zero, were, not, however, universally, accepted, about, this, period, pierre, simon, laplace, and, antoine, lavoisier, in, their, 1780, treatise, on, heat, arrived, at, values, ranging, from, 1, 500, to, 3, 000, below, the, freezing, point, of, water, and, thought, that, in, any, case, it, must, be, at, least, 600, below, john, dalton, in, his, chemical, philosophy, gave, ten, calculations, of, this, value, and, finally, adopted, 3, 000, c, as, the, natural, zero, of, temperature, from, 1787, to, 1802, it, was, determined, by, jacques, charles, unpublished, john, dalton, and, joseph, louis, gay, lussac, that, at, constant, pressure, ideal, gases, expanded, or, contracted, their, volume, linearly, charles, s, law, by, about, 1, 273, parts, per, degree, celsius, of, temperature, s, change, up, or, down, between, 0, and, 100, c, this, suggested, that, the, volume, of, a, gas, cooled, at, about, 273, c, would, reach, zero, after, james, prescott, joule, had, determined, the, mechanical, equivalent, of, heat, lord, kelvin, approached, the, question, from, an, entirely, different, point, of, view, and, in, 1848, devised, a, scale, of, absolute, temperature, that, was, independent, of, the, properties, of, any, particular, substance, and, was, based, on, carnot, s, theory, of, the, motive, power, of, heat, and, data, published, by, henri, victor, regnault, it, followed, from, the, principles, on, which, this, scale, was, constructed, that, its, zero, was, placed, at, 273, c, at, almost, precisely, the, same, point, as, the, zero, of, the, air, thermometer, where, the, air, volume, would, reach, nothing, this, value, was, not, immediately, accepted, values, ranging, from, 271, 1, c, 455, 98, f, to, 274, 5, c, 462, 10, f, derived, from, laboratory, measurements, and, observations, of, astronomical, refraction, remained, in, use, in, the, early, 20th, century, with, a, better, theoretical, understanding, of, absolute, zero, scientists, were, eager, to, reach, this, temperature, in, the, lab, by, 1845, michael, faraday, had, managed, to, liquefy, most, gases, then, known, to, exist, and, reached, a, new, record, for, lowest, temperatures, by, reaching, 130, c, 202, f, 143, k, faraday, believed, that, certain, gases, such, as, oxygen, nitrogen, and, hydrogen, were, permanent, gases, and, could, not, be, liquefied, decades, later, in, 1873, dutch, theoretical, scientist, johannes, diderik, van, der, waals, demonstrated, that, these, gases, could, be, liquefied, but, only, under, conditions, of, very, high, pressure, and, very, low, temperatures, in, 1877, louis, paul, cailletet, in, france, and, raoul, pictet, in, switzerland, succeeded, in, producing, the, first, droplets, of, liquid, air, at, 195, c, 319, 0, f, 78, 1, k, this, was, followed, in, 1883, by, the, production, of, liquid, oxygen, 218, c, 360, 4, f, 55, 1, k, by, the, polish, professors, zygmunt, wr, blewski, and, karol, olszewski, scottish, chemist, and, physicist, james, dewar, and, dutch, physicist, heike, kamerlingh, onnes, took, on, the, challenge, to, liquefy, the, remaining, gases, hydrogen, and, helium, in, 1898, after, 20, years, of, effort, dewar, was, the, first, to, liquefy, hydrogen, reaching, a, new, low, temperature, record, of, 252, c, 421, 6, f, 21, 1, k, however, kamerlingh, onnes, his, rival, was, the, first, to, liquefy, helium, in, 1908, using, several, precooling, stages, and, the, hampson, linde, cycle, he, lowered, the, temperature, to, the, boiling, point, of, helium, 269, c, 452, 20, f, 4, 15, k, by, reducing, the, pressure, of, the, liquid, helium, he, achieved, an, even, lower, temperature, near, 1, 5, k, these, were, the, coldest, temperatures, achieved, on, earth, at, the, time, and, his, achievement, earned, him, the, nobel, prize, in, 1913, kamerlingh, onnes, would, continue, to, study, the, properties, of, materials, at, temperatures, near, absolute, zero, describing, superconductivity, and, superfluids, for, the, first, time, the, average, temperature, of, the, universe, today, is, approximately, 2, 73, kelvins, 454, 76, f, or, about, 270, 42, c, based, on, measurements, of, cosmic, microwave, background, radiation, standard, models, of, the, future, expansion, of, the, universe, predict, that, the, average, temperature, of, the, universe, is, decreasing, over, time, this, temperature, is, calculated, as, the, mean, density, of, energy, in, space, it, should, not, be, confused, with, the, mean, electron, temperature, total, energy, divided, by, particle, count, which, has, increased, over, time, absolute, zero, cannot, be, achieved, although, it, is, possible, to, reach, temperatures, close, to, it, through, the, use, of, evaporative, cooling, cryocoolers, dilution, refrigerators, and, nuclear, adiabatic, demagnetization, the, use, of, laser, cooling, has, produced, temperatures, of, less, than, a, billionth, of, a, kelvin, at, very, low, temperatures, in, the, vicinity, of, absolute, zero, matter, exhibits, many, unusual, properties, including, superconductivity, superfluidity, and, bose, einstein, condensation, to, study, such, phenomena, scientists, have, worked, to, obtain, even, lower, temperatures
