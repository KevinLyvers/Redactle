the, electrical, resistance, of, an, object, is, a, measure, of, its, opposition, to, the, flow, of, electric, current, its, reciprocal, quantity, is, electrical, conductance, measuring, the, ease, with, which, an, electric, current, passes, electrical, resistance, shares, some, conceptual, parallels, with, mechanical, friction, the, si, unit, of, electrical, resistance, is, the, ohm, while, electrical, conductance, is, measured, in, siemens, s, formerly, called, the, mho, and, then, represented, by, the, resistance, of, an, object, depends, in, large, part, on, the, material, it, is, made, of, objects, made, of, electrical, insulators, like, rubber, tend, to, have, very, high, resistance, and, low, conductance, while, objects, made, of, electrical, conductors, like, metals, tend, to, have, very, low, resistance, and, high, conductance, this, relationship, is, quantified, by, resistivity, or, conductivity, the, nature, of, a, material, is, not, the, only, factor, in, resistance, and, conductance, however, it, also, depends, on, the, size, and, shape, of, an, object, because, these, properties, are, extensive, rather, than, intensive, for, example, a, wire, s, resistance, is, higher, if, it, is, long, and, thin, and, lower, if, it, is, short, and, thick, all, objects, resist, electrical, current, except, for, superconductors, which, have, a, resistance, of, zero, the, resistance, r, of, an, object, is, defined, as, the, ratio, of, voltage, v, across, it, to, current, i, through, it, while, the, conductance, g, is, the, reciprocal, r, v, i, g, i, v, 1, r, displaystyle, r, frac, v, i, qquad, g, frac, i, v, frac, 1, r, for, a, wide, variety, of, materials, and, conditions, v, and, i, are, directly, proportional, to, each, other, and, therefore, r, and, g, are, constants, although, they, will, depend, on, the, size, and, shape, of, the, object, the, material, it, is, made, of, and, other, factors, like, temperature, or, strain, this, proportionality, is, called, ohm, s, law, and, materials, that, satisfy, it, are, called, ohmic, materials, in, other, cases, such, as, a, transformer, diode, or, battery, v, and, i, are, not, directly, proportional, the, ratio, v, i, is, sometimes, still, useful, and, is, referred, to, as, a, chordal, resistance, or, static, resistance, since, it, corresponds, to, the, inverse, slope, of, a, chord, between, the, origin, and, an, i, v, curve, in, other, situations, the, derivative, d, v, d, i, textstyle, frac, mathrm, d, v, mathrm, d, i, may, be, most, useful, this, is, called, the, differential, resistance, in, the, hydraulic, analogy, current, flowing, through, a, wire, or, resistor, is, like, water, flowing, through, a, pipe, and, the, voltage, drop, across, the, wire, is, like, the, pressure, drop, that, pushes, water, through, the, pipe, conductance, is, proportional, to, how, much, flow, occurs, for, a, given, pressure, and, resistance, is, proportional, to, how, much, pressure, is, required, to, achieve, a, given, flow, the, voltage, drop, i, e, difference, between, voltages, on, one, side, of, the, resistor, and, the, other, not, the, voltage, itself, provides, the, driving, force, pushing, current, through, a, resistor, in, hydraulics, it, is, similar, the, pressure, difference, between, two, sides, of, a, pipe, not, the, pressure, itself, determines, the, flow, through, it, for, example, there, may, be, a, large, water, pressure, above, the, pipe, which, tries, to, push, water, down, through, the, pipe, but, there, may, be, an, equally, large, water, pressure, below, the, pipe, which, tries, to, push, water, back, up, through, the, pipe, if, these, pressures, are, equal, no, water, flows, in, the, image, at, right, the, water, pressure, below, the, pipe, is, zero, the, resistance, and, conductance, of, a, wire, resistor, or, other, element, is, mostly, determined, by, two, properties, geometry, is, important, because, it, is, more, difficult, to, push, water, through, a, long, narrow, pipe, than, a, wide, short, pipe, in, the, same, way, a, long, thin, copper, wire, has, higher, resistance, lower, conductance, than, a, short, thick, copper, wire, materials, are, important, as, well, a, pipe, filled, with, hair, restricts, the, flow, of, water, more, than, a, clean, pipe, of, the, same, shape, and, size, similarly, electrons, can, flow, freely, and, easily, through, a, copper, wire, but, cannot, flow, as, easily, through, a, steel, wire, of, the, same, shape, and, size, and, they, essentially, cannot, flow, at, all, through, an, insulator, like, rubber, regardless, of, its, shape, the, difference, between, copper, steel, and, rubber, is, related, to, their, microscopic, structure, and, electron, configuration, and, is, quantified, by, a, property, called, resistivity, in, addition, to, geometry, and, material, there, are, various, other, factors, that, influence, resistance, and, conductance, such, as, temperature, see, below, substances, in, which, electricity, can, flow, are, called, conductors, a, piece, of, conducting, material, of, a, particular, resistance, meant, for, use, in, a, circuit, is, called, a, resistor, conductors, are, made, of, high, conductivity, materials, such, as, metals, in, particular, copper, and, aluminium, resistors, on, the, other, hand, are, made, of, a, wide, variety, of, materials, depending, on, factors, such, as, the, desired, resistance, amount, of, energy, that, it, needs, to, dissipate, precision, and, costs, for, many, materials, the, current, i, through, the, material, is, proportional, to, the, voltage, v, applied, across, it, i, v, displaystyle, i, propto, v, over, a, wide, range, of, voltages, and, currents, therefore, the, resistance, and, conductance, of, objects, or, electronic, components, made, of, these, materials, is, constant, this, relationship, is, called, ohm, s, law, and, materials, which, obey, it, are, called, ohmic, materials, examples, of, ohmic, components, are, wires, and, resistors, the, current, voltage, graph, of, an, ohmic, device, consists, of, a, straight, line, through, the, origin, with, positive, slope, other, components, and, materials, used, in, electronics, do, not, obey, ohm, s, law, the, current, is, not, proportional, to, the, voltage, so, the, resistance, varies, with, the, voltage, and, current, through, them, these, are, called, nonlinear, or, non, ohmic, examples, include, diodes, and, fluorescent, lamps, the, resistance, of, a, given, object, depends, primarily, on, two, factors, what, material, it, is, made, of, and, its, shape, for, a, given, material, the, resistance, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, cross, sectional, area, for, example, a, thick, copper, wire, has, lower, resistance, than, an, otherwise, identical, thin, copper, wire, also, for, a, given, material, the, resistance, is, proportional, to, the, length, for, example, a, long, copper, wire, has, higher, resistance, than, an, otherwise, identical, short, copper, wire, the, resistance, r, and, conductance, g, of, a, conductor, of, uniform, cross, section, therefore, can, be, computed, as, r, a, g, a, displaystyle, begin, aligned, r, rho, frac, ell, a, g, sigma, frac, a, ell, end, aligned, where, displaystyle, ell, is, the, length, of, the, conductor, measured, in, metres, m, a, is, the, cross, sectional, area, of, the, conductor, measured, in, square, metres, m, 2, sigma, is, the, electrical, conductivity, measured, in, siemens, per, meter, s, m, 1, and, rho, is, the, electrical, resistivity, also, called, specific, electrical, resistance, of, the, material, measured, in, ohm, metres, m, the, resistivity, and, conductivity, are, proportionality, constants, and, therefore, depend, only, on, the, material, the, wire, is, made, of, not, the, geometry, of, the, wire, resistivity, and, conductivity, are, reciprocals, 1, displaystyle, rho, 1, sigma, resistivity, is, a, measure, of, the, material, s, ability, to, oppose, electric, current, this, formula, is, not, exact, as, it, assumes, the, current, density, is, totally, uniform, in, the, conductor, which, is, not, always, true, in, practical, situations, however, this, formula, still, provides, a, good, approximation, for, long, thin, conductors, such, as, wires, another, situation, for, which, this, formula, is, not, exact, is, with, alternating, current, ac, because, the, skin, effect, inhibits, current, flow, near, the, center, of, the, conductor, for, this, reason, the, geometrical, cross, section, is, different, from, the, effective, cross, section, in, which, current, actually, flows, so, resistance, is, higher, than, expected, similarly, if, two, conductors, near, each, other, carry, ac, current, their, resistances, increase, due, to, the, proximity, effect, at, commercial, power, frequency, these, effects, are, significant, for, large, conductors, carrying, large, currents, such, as, busbars, in, an, electrical, substation, or, large, power, cables, carrying, more, than, a, few, hundred, amperes, the, resistivity, of, different, materials, varies, by, an, enormous, amount, for, example, the, conductivity, of, teflon, is, about, 10, 30, times, lower, than, the, conductivity, of, copper, loosely, speaking, this, is, because, metals, have, large, numbers, of, delocalized, electrons, that, are, not, stuck, in, any, one, place, so, they, are, free, to, move, across, large, distances, in, an, insulator, such, as, teflon, each, electron, is, tightly, bound, to, a, single, molecule, so, a, great, force, is, required, to, pull, it, away, semiconductors, lie, between, these, two, extremes, more, details, can, be, found, in, the, article, electrical, resistivity, and, conductivity, for, the, case, of, electrolyte, solutions, see, the, article, conductivity, electrolytic, resistivity, varies, with, temperature, in, semiconductors, resistivity, also, changes, when, exposed, to, light, see, below, an, instrument, for, measuring, resistance, is, called, an, ohmmeter, simple, ohmmeters, cannot, measure, low, resistances, accurately, because, the, resistance, of, their, measuring, leads, causes, a, voltage, drop, that, interferes, with, the, measurement, so, more, accurate, devices, use, four, terminal, sensing, many, electrical, elements, such, as, diodes, and, batteries, do, not, satisfy, ohm, s, law, these, are, called, non, ohmic, or, non, linear, and, their, current, voltage, curves, are, not, straight, lines, through, the, origin, resistance, and, conductance, can, still, be, defined, for, non, ohmic, elements, however, unlike, ohmic, resistance, non, linear, resistance, is, not, constant, but, varies, with, the, voltage, or, current, through, the, device, i, e, its, operating, point, there, are, two, types, of, resistance, also, called, chordal, or, dc, resistance, this, corresponds, to, the, usual, definition, of, resistance, the, voltage, divided, by, the, current, r, s, t, a, t, i, c, v, i, displaystyle, r, mathrm, static, v, over, i, also, called, dynamic, incremental, or, small, signal, resistance, it, is, the, derivative, of, the, voltage, with, respect, to, the, current, the, slope, of, the, current, voltage, curve, at, a, point, r, d, i, f, f, d, v, d, i, displaystyle, r, mathrm, diff, mathrm, d, v, over, mathrm, d, i, when, an, alternating, current, flows, through, a, circuit, the, relation, between, current, and, voltage, across, a, circuit, element, is, characterized, not, only, by, the, ratio, of, their, magnitudes, but, also, the, difference, in, their, phases, for, example, in, an, ideal, resistor, the, moment, when, the, voltage, reaches, its, maximum, the, current, also, reaches, its, maximum, current, and, voltage, are, oscillating, in, phase, but, for, a, capacitor, or, inductor, the, maximum, current, flow, occurs, as, the, voltage, passes, through, zero, and, vice, versa, current, and, voltage, are, oscillating, 90, out, of, phase, see, image, below, complex, numbers, are, used, to, keep, track, of, both, the, phase, and, magnitude, of, current, and, voltage, u, t, r, e, u, 0, e, j, t, i, t, r, e, i, 0, e, j, t, z, u, i,

free, current, the, complex, angle, arg, z, arg, y, displaystyle, theta, arg, z, arg, y, is, the, phase, difference, between, the, voltage, and, current, passing, through, a, component, with, impedance, z, for, capacitors, and, inductors, this, angle, is, exactly, 90, or, 90, respectively, and, x, and, b, are, nonzero, ideal, resistors, have, an, angle, of, 0, since, x, is, zero, and, hence, b, also, and, z, and, y, reduce, to, r, and, g, respectively, in, general, ac, systems, are, designed, to, keep, the, phase, angle, close, to, 0, as, much, as, possible, since, it, reduces, the, reactive, power, which, does, no, useful, work, at, a, load, in, a, simple, case, with, an, inductive, load, causing, the, phase, to, increase, a, capacitor, may, be, added, for, compensation, at, one, frequency, since, the, capacitor, s, phase, shift, is, negative, bringing, the, total, impedance, phase, closer, to, 0, again, y, is, the, reciprocal, of, z, z, 1, y, displaystyle, z, 1, y, for, all, circuits, just, as, r, 1, g, displaystyle, r, 1, g, for, dc, circuits, containing, only, resistors, or, ac, circuits, for, which, either, the, reactance, or, susceptance, happens, to, be, zero, x, or, b, 0, respectively, if, one, is, zero, then, for, realistic, systems, both, must, be, zero, a, key, feature, of, ac, circuits, is, that, the, resistance, and, conductance, can, be, frequency, dependent, a, phenomenon, known, as, the, universal, dielectric, response, one, reason, mentioned, above, is, the, skin, effect, and, the, related, proximity, effect, another, reason, is, that, the, resistivity, itself, may, depend, on, frequency, see, drude, model, deep, level, traps, resonant, frequency, kramers, kronig, relations, etc, resistors, and, other, elements, with, resistance, oppose, the, flow, of, electric, current, therefore, electrical, energy, is, required, to, push, current, through, the, resistance, this, electrical, energy, is, dissipated, heating, the, resistor, in, the, process, this, is, called, joule, heating, after, james, prescott, joule, also, called, ohmic, heating, or, resistive, heating, the, dissipation, of, electrical, energy, is, often, undesired, particularly, in, the, case, of, transmission, losses, in, power, lines, high, voltage, transmission, helps, reduce, the, losses, by, reducing, the, current, for, a, given, power, on, the, other, hand, joule, heating, is, sometimes, useful, for, example, in, electric, stoves, and, other, electric, heaters, also, called, resistive, heaters, as, another, example, incandescent, lamps, rely, on, joule, heating, the, filament, is, heated, to, such, a, high, temperature, that, it, glows, white, hot, with, thermal, radiation, also, called, incandescence, the, formula, for, joule, heating, is, p, i, 2, r, displaystyle, p, i, 2, r, where, p, is, the, power, energy, per, unit, time, converted, from, electrical, energy, to, thermal, energy, r, is, the, resistance, and, i, is, the, current, through, the, resistor, near, room, temperature, the, resistivity, of, metals, typically, increases, as, temperature, is, increased, while, the, resistivity, of, semiconductors, typically, decreases, as, temperature, is, increased, the, resistivity, of, insulators, and, electrolytes, may, increase, or, decrease, depending, on, the, system, for, the, detailed, behavior, and, explanation, see, electrical, resistivity, and, conductivity, as, a, consequence, the, resistance, of, wires, resistors, and, other, components, often, change, with, temperature, this, effect, may, be, undesired, causing, an, electronic, circuit, to, malfunction, at, extreme, temperatures, in, some, cases, however, the, effect, is, put, to, good, use, when, temperature, dependent, resistance, of, a, component, is, used, purposefully, the, component, is, called, a, resistance, thermometer, or, thermistor, a, resistance, thermometer, is, made, of, metal, usually, platinum, while, a, thermistor, is, made, of, ceramic, or, polymer, resistance, thermometers, and, thermistors, are, generally, used, in, two, ways, first, they, can, be, used, as, thermometers, by, measuring, the, resistance, the, temperature, of, the, environment, can, be, inferred, second, they, can, be, used, in, conjunction, with, joule, heating, also, called, self, heating, if, a, large, current, is, running, through, the, resistor, the, resistor, s, temperature, rises, and, therefore, its, resistance, changes, therefore, these, components, can, be, used, in, a, circuit, protection, role, similar, to, fuses, or, for, feedback, in, circuits, or, for, many, other, purposes, in, general, self, heating, can, turn, a, resistor, into, a, nonlinear, and, hysteretic, circuit, element, for, more, details, see, thermistor, self, heating, effects, if, the, temperature, t, does, not, vary, too, much, a, linear, approximation, is, typically, used, r, t, r, 0, 1, t, t, 0, displaystyle, r, t, r, 0, where, displaystyle, alpha, is, called, the, temperature, coefficient, of, resistance, t, 0, displaystyle, t, 0, is, a, fixed, reference, temperature, usually, room, temperature, and, r, 0, displaystyle, r, 0, is, the, resistance, at, temperature, t, 0, displaystyle, t, 0, the, parameter, displaystyle, alpha, is, an, empirical, parameter, fitted, from, measurement, data, because, the, linear, approximation, is, only, an, approximation, displaystyle, alpha, is, different, for, different, reference, temperatures, for, this, reason, it, is, usual, to, specify, the, temperature, that, displaystyle, alpha, was, measured, at, with, a, suffix, such, as, 15, displaystyle, alpha, 15, and, the, relationship, only, holds, in, a, range, of, temperatures, around, the, reference, the, temperature, coefficient, displaystyle, alpha, is, typically, 3, 10, 3, k, 1, to, 6, 10, 3, k, 1, for, metals, near, room, temperature, it, is, usually, negative, for, semiconductors, and, insulators, with, highly, variable, magnitude, just, as, the, resistance, of, a, conductor, depends, upon, temperature, the, resistance, of, a, conductor, depends, upon, strain, by, placing, a, conductor, under, tension, a, form, of, stress, that, leads, to, strain, in, the, form, of, stretching, of, the, conductor, the, length, of, the, section, of, conductor, under, tension, increases, and, its, cross, sectional, area, decreases, both, these, effects, contribute, to, increasing, the, resistance, of, the, strained, section, of, conductor, under, compression, strain, in, the, opposite, direction, the, resistance, of, the, strained, section, of, conductor, decreases, see, the, discussion, on, strain, gauges, for, details, about, devices, constructed, to, take, advantage, of, this, effect, some, resistors, particularly, those, made, from, semiconductors, exhibit, photoconductivity, meaning, that, their, resistance, changes, when, light, is, shining, on, them, therefore, they, are, called, photoresistors, or, light, dependent, resistors, these, are, a, common, type, of, light, detector, superconductors, are, materials, that, have, exactly, zero, resistance, and, infinite, conductance, because, they, can, have, v, 0, and, i, 0, this, also, means, there, is, no, joule, heating, or, in, other, words, no, dissipation, of, electrical, energy, therefore, if, superconductive, wire, is, made, into, a, closed, loop, current, flows, around, the, loop, forever, superconductors, require, cooling, to, temperatures, near, 4, k, with, liquid, helium, for, most, metallic, superconductors, like, niobium, tin, alloys, or, cooling, to, temperatures, near, 77, k, with, liquid, nitrogen, for, the, expensive, brittle, and, delicate, ceramic, high, temperature, superconductors, nevertheless, there, are, many, technological, applications, of, superconductivity, including, superconducting, magnets
