derived, from, the, roman, uncia, twelfth, the, word, inch, is, also, sometimes, used, to, translate, similar, units, in, other, measurement, systems, usually, understood, as, deriving, from, the, width, of, the, human, thumb, standards, for, the, exact, length, of, an, inch, have, varied, in, the, past, but, since, the, adoption, of, the, international, yard, during, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, the, inch, has, been, based, on, the, metric, system, and, defined, as, exactly, 25, 4, mm, the, english, word, inch, old, english, ynce, was, an, early, borrowing, from, latin, uncia, one, twelfth, roman, inch, roman, ounce, the, vowel, change, from, latin, u, to, old, english, y, which, became, modern, english, is, known, as, umlaut, the, consonant, change, from, the, latin, k, spelled, c, to, english, t, is, palatalisation, both, were, features, of, old, english, phonology, see, phonological, history, of, old, english, palatalization, and, germanic, umlaut, i, mutation, in, old, english, for, more, information, inch, is, cognate, with, ounce, old, english, ynse, whose, separate, pronunciation, and, spelling, reflect, its, reborrowing, in, middle, english, from, anglo, norman, unce, and, ounce, in, many, other, european, languages, the, word, for, inch, is, the, same, as, or, derived, from, the, word, for, thumb, as, a, man, s, thumb, is, about, an, inch, wide, and, this, was, even, sometimes, used, to, define, the, inch, in, the, dutch, language, a, term, for, inch, is, engelse, duim, english, thumb, examples, include, catalan, polzada, inch, and, polze, thumb, czech,

unit, of, length, in, the, united, states, canada, and, the, united, kingdom, for, the, united, kingdom, guidance, on, public, sector, use, states, that, since, 1, october, 1995, without, time, limit, the, inch, along, with, the, foot, is, to, be, used, as, a, primary, unit, for, road, signs, and, related, measurements, of, distance, with, the, possible, exception, of, clearance, heights, and, widths, and, may, continue, to, be, used, as, a, secondary, or, supplementary, indication, following, a, metric, measurement, for, other, purposes, inches, are, used, for, display, screens, e, g, televisions, and, computer, monitors, worldwide, it, is, the, official, japanese, standard, for, electronic, parts, especially, display, screens, and, is, the, industry, standard, throughout, continental, europe, for, display, screens, germany, being, one, of, few, countries, to, supplement, it, with, centimetres, in, most, stores, inches, are, commonly, used, to, specify, the, diameter, of, vehicle, wheel, rims, and, the, corresponding, inner, diameter, of, tyres, in, tyre, codes, both, inch, based, and, millimeter, based, hex, keys, are, widely, available, for, sale, in, europe, the, international, standard, symbol, for, inch, is, in, see, iso, 31, 1, annex, a, but, traditionally, the, inch, is, denoted, by, a, double, prime, which, is, often, approximated, by, a, double, quote, symbol, and, the, foot, by, a, prime, which, is, often, approximated, by, an, apostrophe, for, example, three, feet, two, inches, can, be, written, as, 3, 2, this, is, akin, to, how, the, first, and, second, cuts, of, the, hour, are, likewise, indicated, by, prime, and, double, prime, symbols, and, also, the, first, and, second, cuts, of, the, degree, subdivisions, of, an, inch, are, typically, written, using, dyadic, fractions, with, odd, number, numerators, for, example, two, and, three, eighths, of, an, inch, would, be, written, as, 2, 3, 8, and, not, as, 2, 375, nor, as, 2, 6, 16, however, for, engineering, purposes, fractions, are, commonly, given, to, three, or, four, places, of, decimals, and, have, been, for, many, years, 1, international, inch, is, equal, to, the, earliest, known, reference, to, the, inch, in, england, is, from, the, laws, of, thelberht, dating, to, the, early, 7th, century, surviving, in, a, single, manuscript, the, textus, roffensis, from, 1120, paragraph, lxvii, sets, out, the, fine, for, wounds, of, various, depths, one, inch, one, shilling, two, inches, two, shillings, etc, an, anglo, saxon, unit, of, length, was, the, barleycorn, after, 1066, 1, inch, was, equal, to, 3, barleycorns, which, continued, to, be, its, legal, definition, for, several, centuries, with, the, barleycorn, being, the, base, unit, one, of, the, earliest, such, definitions, is, that, of, 1324, where, the, legal, definition, of, the, inch, was, set, out, in, a, statute, of, edward, ii, of, england, defining, it, as, three, grains, of, barley, dry, and, round, placed, end, to, end, lengthwise, similar, definitions, are, recorded, in, both, english, and, welsh, medieval, law, tracts, one, dating, from, the, first, half, of, the, 10th, century, is, contained, in, the, laws, of, hywel, dda, which, superseded, those, of, dyfnwal, an, even, earlier, definition, of, the, inch, in, wales, both, definitions, as, recorded, in, ancient, laws, and, institutes, of, wales, vol, i, pp, 184, 187, 189, are, that, three, lengths, of, a, barleycorn, is, the, inch, king, david, i, of, scotland, in, his, assize, of, weights, and, measures, c, 1150, is, said, to, have, defined, the, scottish, inch, as, the, width, of, an, average, man, s, thumb, at, the, base, of, the, nail, even, including, the, requirement, to, calculate, the, average, of, a, small, a, medium, and, a, large, man, s, measures, however, the, oldest, surviving, manuscripts, date, from, the, early, 14th, century, and, appear, to, have, been, altered, with, the, inclusion, of, newer, material, in, 1814, charles, butler, a, mathematics, teacher, at, cheam, school, recorded, the, old, legal, definition, of, the, inch, to, be, three, grains, of, sound, ripe, barley, being, taken, out, the, middle, of, the, ear, well, dried, and, laid, end, to, end, in, a, row, and, placed, the, barleycorn, not, the, inch, as, the, base, unit, of, the, english, long, measure, system, from, which, all, other, units, were, derived, john, bouvier, similarly, recorded, in, his, 1843, law, dictionary, that, the, barleycorn, was, the, fundamental, measure, butler, observed, however, that, s, the, length, of, the, barley, corn, cannot, be, fixed, so, the, inch, according, to, this, method, will, be, uncertain, noting, that, a, standard, inch, measure, was, now, kept, in, the, exchequer, chamber, guildhall, and, that, was, the, legal, definition, of, the, inch, this, was, a, point, also, made, by, george, long, in, his, 1842, penny, cyclop, dia, observing, that, standard, measures, had, since, surpassed, the, barleycorn, definition, of, the, inch, and, that, to, recover, the, inch, measure, from, its, original, definition, in, case, the, standard, measure, were, destroyed, would, involve, the, measurement, of, large, numbers, of, barleycorns, and, taking, their, average, lengths, he, noted, that, this, process, would, not, perfectly, recover, the, standard, since, it, might, introduce, errors, of, anywhere, between, one, hundredth, and, one, tenth, of, an, inch, in, the, definition, of, a, yard, before, the, adoption, of, the, international, yard, and, pound, various, definitions, were, in, use, in, the, united, kingdom, and, most, countries, of, the, british, commonwealth, the, inch, was, defined, in, terms, of, the, imperial, standard, yard, the, united, states, adopted, the, conversion, factor, 1, metre, 39, 37, inches, by, an, act, in, 1866, in, 1893, mendenhall, ordered, the, physical, realization, of, the, inch, to, be, based, on, the, international, prototype, metres, numbers, 21, and, 27, which, had, been, received, from, the, cgpm, together, with, the, previously, adopted, conversion, factor, as, a, result, of, the, definitions, above, the, u, s, inch, was, effectively, defined, as, 25, 4000508, mm, with, a, reference, temperature, of, 68, degrees, fahrenheit, and, the, uk, inch, at, 25, 399977, mm, with, a, reference, temperature, of, 62, degrees, fahrenheit, when, carl, edvard, johansson, started, manufacturing, gauge, blocks, in, inch, sizes, in, 1912, johansson, s, compromise, was, to, manufacture, gauge, blocks, with, a, nominal, size, of, 25, 4mm, with, a, reference, temperature, of, 20, degrees, celsius, accurate, to, within, a, few, parts, per, million, of, both, official, definitions, because, johansson, s, blocks, were, so, popular, his, blocks, became, the, de, facto, standard, for, manufacturers, internationally, with, other, manufacturers, of, gauge, blocks, following, johansson, s, definition, by, producing, blocks, designed, to, be, equivalent, to, his, in, 1930, the, british, standards, institution, adopted, an, inch, of, exactly, 25, 4, mm, the, american, standards, association, followed, suit, in, 1933, by, 1935, industry, in, 16, countries, had, adopted, the, industrial, inch, as, it, came, to, be, known, effectively, endorsing, johansson, s, pragmatic, choice, of, conversion, ratio, in, 1946, the, commonwealth, science, congress, recommended, a, yard, of, exactly, 0, 9144, metres, for, adoption, throughout, the, british, commonwealth, this, was, adopted, by, canada, in, 1951, the, united, states, on, 1, july, 1959, australia, in, 1961, effective, 1, january, 1964, and, the, united, kingdom, in, 1963, effective, on, 1, january, 1964, the, new, standards, gave, an, inch, of, exactly, 25, 4, mm, 1, 7, millionths, of, an, inch, longer, than, the, old, imperial, inch, and, 2, millionths, of, an, inch, shorter, than, the, old, us, inch, the, united, states, retained, the, 1, 39, 37, metre, definition, for, surveying, producing, a, 2, millionth, part, difference, between, standard, and, us, survey, inches, this, is, approximately, 1, 8, inch, per, mile, 12, 7, kilometres, is, exactly, 500, 000, standard, inches, and, exactly, 499, 999, survey, inches, this, difference, is, substantial, when, doing, calculations, in, state, plane, coordinate, systems, with, coordinate, values, in, the, hundreds, of, thousands, or, millions, of, feet, in, 2020, the, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, announced, that, the, u, s, survey, foot, would, be, phased, out, on, 1, january, 2023, and, be, superseded, by, the, international, foot, also, known, as, the, foot, equal, to, 0, 3048, metres, exactly, for, all, further, applications, this, implies, that, the, survey, inch, was, replaced, by, the, international, inch, before, the, adoption, of, the, metric, system, several, european, countries, had, customary, units, whose, name, translates, into, inch, the, french, pouce, measured, roughly, 27, 0, mm, at, least, when, applied, to, describe, the, calibre, of, artillery, pieces, the, amsterdam, foot, voet, consisted, of, 11, amsterdam, inches, duim, the, amsterdam, foot, is, about, 8, shorter, than, an, english, foot, the, now, obsolete, scottish, inch, scottish, gaelic, irleach, 1, 12, of, a, scottish, foot, was, about, 1, 0016, imperial, inches, about, 25, 44, mm
