tellurium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, te, and, atomic, number, 52, it, is, a, brittle, mildly, toxic, rare, silver, white, metalloid, tellurium, is, chemically, related, to, selenium, and, sulfur, all, three, of, which, are, chalcogens, it, is, occasionally, found, in, its, native, form, as, elemental, crystals, tellurium, is, far, more, common, in, the, universe, as, a, whole, than, on, earth, its, extreme, rarity, in, the, earth, s, crust, comparable, to, that, of, platinum, is, due, partly, to, its, formation, of, a, volatile, hydride, that, caused, tellurium, to, be, lost, to, space, as, a, gas, during, the, hot, nebular, formation, of, earth, tellurium, bearing, compounds, were, first, discovered, in, 1782, in, a, gold, mine, in, kleinschlatten, transylvania, now, zlatna, romania, by, austrian, mineralogist, franz, joseph, m, ller, von, reichenstein, although, it, was, martin, heinrich, klaproth, who, named, the, new, element, in, 1798, after, the, latin, tellus, earth, gold, telluride, minerals, are, the, most, notable, natural, gold, compounds, however, they, are, not, a, commercially, significant, source, of, tellurium, itself, which, is, normally, extracted, as, a, by, product, of, copper, and, lead, production, commercially, the, primary, use, of, tellurium, is, cdte, solar, panels, and, thermoelectric, devices, a, more, traditional, application, in, copper, tellurium, copper, and, steel, alloys, where, tellurium, improves, machinability, also, consumes, a, considerable, portion, of, tellurium, production, tellurium, is, considered, a, technology, critical, element, tellurium, has, no, biological, function, although, fungi, can, use, it, in, place, of, sulfur, and, selenium, in, amino, acids, such, as, tellurocysteine, and, telluromethionine, in, humans, tellurium, is, partly, metabolized, into, dimethyl, telluride, ch, 3, 2, te, a, gas, with, a, garlic, like, odor, exhaled, in, the, breath, of, victims, of, tellurium, exposure, or, poisoning, tellurium, has, two, allotropes, crystalline, and, amorphous, when, crystalline, tellurium, is, silvery, white, with, a, metallic, luster, the, crystals, are, trigonal, and, chiral, space, group, 152, or, 154, depending, on, the, chirality, like, the, gray, form, of, selenium, it, is, a, brittle, and, easily, pulverized, metalloid, amorphous, tellurium, is, a, black, brown, powder, prepared, by, precipitating, it, from, a, solution, of, tellurous, acid, or, telluric, acid, te, oh, 6, tellurium, is, a, semiconductor, that, shows, greater, electrical, conductivity, in, certain, directions, depending, on, atomic, alignment, the, conductivity, increases, slightly, when, exposed, to, light, photoconductivity, when, molten, tellurium, is, corrosive, to, copper, iron, and, stainless, steel, of, the, chalcogens, oxygen, family, elements, tellurium, has, the, highest, melting, and, boiling, points, at, 722, 66, and, 1, 261, k, 449, 51, and, 987, 85, c, respectively, crystalline, tellurium, consists, of, parallel, helical, chains, of, te, atoms, with, three, atoms, per, turn, this, gray, material, resists, oxidation, by, air, and, is, not, volatile, naturally, occurring, tellurium, has, eight, isotopes, six, of, those, isotopes, 120, te, 122, te, 123, te, 124, te, 125, te, and, 126, te, are, stable, the, other, two, 128, te, and, 130, te, are, slightly, radioactive, with, extremely, long, half, lives, including, 2, 2, 10, 24, years, for, 128, te, this, is, the, longest, known, half, life, among, all, radionuclides, and, is, about, 160, trillion, 10, 12, times, the, age, of, the, known, universe, a, further, 31, artificial, radioisotopes, of, tellurium, are, known, with, atomic, masses, ranging, from, 104, to, 142, and, with, half, lives, of, 19, days, or, less, also, 17, nuclear, isomers, are, known, with, half, lives, up, to, 154, days, except, for, beryllium, 8, and, beta, delayed, alpha, emission, branches, in, some, lighter, nuclides, tellurium, 104, te, to, 109, te, is, the, second, lightest, element, with, isotopes, known, to, undergo, alpha, decay, antimony, being, the, lightest, the, atomic, mass, of, tellurium, 127, 60, g, mol, 1, exceeds, that, of, iodine, 126, 90, g, mol, 1, the, next, element, in, the, periodic, table, with, an, abundance, in, the, earth, s, crust, comparable, to, that, of, platinum, about, 1, g, kg, tellurium, is, one, of, the, rarest, stable, solid, elements, in, comparison, even, thulium, the, rarest, of, the, stable, lanthanides, has, crystal, abundances, of, 500, g, kg, see, abundance, of, the, chemical, elements, the, rarity, of, tellurium, in, the, earth, s, crust, is, not, a, reflection, of, its, cosmic, abundance, tellurium, is, more, abundant, than, rubidium, in, the, cosmos, though, rubidium, is, 10, 000, times, more, abundant, in, the, earth, s, crust, the, rarity, of, tellurium, on, earth, is, thought, to, be, caused, by, conditions, during, preaccretional, sorting, in, the, solar, nebula, when, the, stable, form, of, certain, elements, in, the, absence, of, oxygen, and, water, was, controlled, by, the, reductive, power, of, free, hydrogen, under, this, scenario, certain, elements, that, form, volatile, hydrides, such, as, tellurium, were, severely, depleted, through, the, evaporation, of, these, hydrides, tellurium, and, selenium, are, the, heavy, elements, most, depleted, by, this, process, tellurium, is, sometimes, found, in, its, native, i, e, elemental, form, but, is, more, often, found, as, the, tellurides, of, gold, such, as, calaverite, and, krennerite, two, different, polymorphs, of, aute, 2, petzite, ag, 3, aute, 2, and, sylvanite, agaute, 4, the, town, of, telluride, colorado, was, named, in, the, hope, of, a, strike, of, gold, telluride, which, never, materialized, though, gold, metal, ore, was, found, gold, itself, is, usually, found, uncombined, but, when, found, as, a, chemical, compound, it, is, often, combined, with, tellurium, although, tellurium, is, found, with, gold, more, often, than, in, uncombined, form, it, is, found, even, more, often, combined, as, tellurides, of, more, common, metals, e, g, melonite, nite, 2, natural, tellurite, and, tellurate, minerals, also, occur, formed, by, the, oxidation, of, tellurides, near, the, earth, s, surface, in, contrast, to, selenium, tellurium, does, not, usually, replace, sulfur, in, minerals, because, of, the, great, difference, in, ion, radii, thus, many, common, sulfide, minerals, contain, substantial, quantities, of, selenium, and, only, traces, of, tellurium, in, the, gold, rush, of, 1893, miners, in, kalgoorlie, discarded, a, pyritic, material, as, they, searched, for, pure, gold, and, it, was, used, to, fill, in, potholes, and, build, sidewalks, in, 1896, that, tailing, was, discovered, to, be, calaverite, a, telluride, of, gold, and, it, sparked, a, second, gold, rush, that, included, mining, the, streets, in, 2023, astronomers, detected, the, creation, of, tellurium, during, collision, between, two, neutron, stars, tellurium, latin, tellus, meaning, earth, was, discovered, in, the, 18th, century, in, a, gold, ore, from, the, mines, in, kleinschlatten, today, zlatna, near, today, s, city, of, alba, iulia, romania, this, ore, was, known, as, faczebajer, wei, es, bl, ttriges, golderz, white, leafy, gold, ore, from, faczebaja, german, name, of, faceb, nya, now, fa, a, b, ii, in, alba, county, or, antimonalischer, goldkies, antimonic, gold, pyrite, and, according, to, anton, von, rupprecht, was, spie, glask, nig, argent, molybdique, containing, native, antimony, in, 1782, franz, joseph, m, ller, von, reichenstein, who, was, then, serving, as, the, austrian, chief, inspector, of, mines, in, transylvania, concluded, that, the, ore, did, not, contain, antimony, but, was, bismuth, sulfide, the, following, year, he, reported, that, this, was, erroneous, and, that, the, ore, contained, mostly, gold, and, an, unknown, metal, very, similar, to, antimony, after, a, thorough, investigation, that, lasted, three, years, and, included, more, than, fifty, tests, m, ller, determined, the, specific, gravity, of, the, mineral, and, noted, that, when, heated, the, new, metal, gives, off, a, white, smoke, with, a, radish, like, odor, that, it, imparts, a, red, color, to, sulfuric, acid, and, that, when, this, solution, is, diluted, with, water, it, has, a, black, precipitate, nevertheless, he, was, not, able, to, identify, this, metal, and, gave, it, the, names, aurum, paradoxum, paradoxical, gold, and, metallum, problematicum, problem, metal, because, it, did, not, exhibit, the, properties, predicted, for, antimony, in, 1789, a, hungarian, scientist, p, l, kitaibel, discovered, the, element, independently, in, an, ore, from, deutsch, pilsen, that, had, been, regarded, as, argentiferous, molybdenite, but, later, he, gave, the, credit, to, m, ller, in, 1798, it, was, named, by, martin, heinrich, klaproth, who, had, earlier, isolated, it, from, the, mineral, calaverite, in, the, early, 1920s, thomas, midgley, jr, found, tellurium, prevented, engine, knocking, when, added, to, fuel, but, ruled, it, out, due, to, the, difficult, to, eradicate, smell, midgley, went, on, to, discover, and, popularize, the, use, of, tetraethyl, lead, the, 1960s, brought, an, increase, in, thermoelectric, applications, for, tellurium, as, bismuth, telluride, and, in, free, machining, steel, alloys, which, became, the, dominant, use, these, applications, were, overtaken, by, the, growing, importance, of, cdte, in, thin, film, solar, cells, in, the, 2000s, most, te, and, se, is, obtained, from, porphyry, copper, deposits, where, it, occurs, in, trace, amounts, the, element, is, recovered, from, anode, sludges, from, the, electrolytic, refining, of, blister, copper, it, is, a, component, of, dusts, from, blast, furnace, refining, of, lead, treatment, of, 1000, tons, of, copper, ore, yields, approximately, one, kilogram, 2, 2, pounds, of, tellurium, the, anode, sludges, contain, the, selenides, and, tellurides, of, the, noble, metals, in, compounds, with, the, formula, m, 2, se, or, m, 2, te, m, cu, ag, au, at, temperatures, of, 500, c, the, anode, sludges, are, roasted, with, sodium, carbonate, under, air, the, metal, ions, are, reduced, to, the, metals, while, the, telluride, is, converted, to, sodium, tellurite, tellurites, can, be, leached, from, the, mixture, with, water, and, are, normally, present, as, hydrotellurites, hteo, 3, in, solution, selenites, are, also, formed, during, this, process, but, they, can, be, separated, by, adding, sulfuric, acid, the, hydrotellurites, are, converted, into, the, insoluble, tellurium, dioxide, while, the, selenites, stay, in, solution, the, metal, is, produced, from, the, oxide, reduced, either, by, electrolysis, or, by, reacting, the, tellurium, dioxide, with, sulfur, dioxide, in, sulfuric, acid, commercial, grade, tellurium, is, usually, marketed, as, 200, mesh, powder, but, is, also, available, as, slabs, ingots, sticks, or, lumps, the, year, end, price, for, tellurium, in, 2000, was, us, 30, per, kilogram, in, recent, years, the, tellurium, price, was, driven, up, by, increased, demand, and, limited, supply, reaching, as, high, as, us, 220, per, pound, in, 2006, the, average, annual, price, for, 99, 99, pure, tellurium, increased, from, 38, per, kilogram, in, 2017, to, 74, per, kilogram, in, 2018, despite, the, expectation, that, improved, production, methods, will, double, production, the, united, states, department, of, energy, doe, anticipates, a, supply, shortfall, of, tellurium, by, 2025, in, the, 2020s, china, produced, ca, 50, of, world, s, tellurium, and, was, the, only, country, that, mined, te, as, the, main, target, rather, than, a, by, product, this, dominance, was, driven, by, the, rapid, expansion, of, solar, cell, industry, in, china, in, 2022, the, largest, te, providers, by, volume, were, china, 340, tonnes, russia, 80, t, japan, 70, t, canada, 50, t, uzbekistan, 50, t, sweden, 40, t, and, the, united, states, no, official, data, tellurium, belongs, to, the, chalcogen, group, 16, family, of, elements, on, the, periodic, table, which, also, includes, oxygen, sulfur, selenium, and, polonium, tellurium, and, selenium, compounds, are, similar, tellurium, exhibits, the, oxidation, states, 2, 2, 4, and, 6, with, 4, being, most, common, reduction, of, te, metal, produces, the, tellurides, and, polytellurides, te, n, 2, the, 2, oxidation, state, is, exhibited, in, binary, compounds, with, many, metals, such, as, zinc, telluride, znte, produced, by, heating, tellurium, with, zinc,

amino, acids, such, as, telluro, cysteine, and, telluro, methionine, organisms, have, shown, a, highly, variable, tolerance, to, tellurium, compounds, many, bacteria, such, as, pseudomonas, aeruginosa, take, up, tellurite, and, reduce, it, to, elemental, tellurium, which, accumulates, and, causes, a, characteristic, and, often, dramatic, darkening, of, cells, in, yeast, this, reduction, is, mediated, by, the, sulfate, assimilation, pathway, tellurium, accumulation, seems, to, account, for, a, major, part, of, the, toxicity, effects, many, organisms, also, metabolize, tellurium, partly, to, form, dimethyl, telluride, although, dimethyl, ditelluride, is, also, formed, by, some, species, dimethyl, telluride, has, been, observed, in, hot, springs, at, very, low, concentrations,

tellurium, compounds, are, considered, to, be, mildly, toxic, and, need, to, be, handled, with, care, although, acute, poisoning, is, rare, tellurium, poisoning, is, particularly, difficult, to, treat, as, many, chelation, agents, used, in, the, treatment, of, metal, poisoning, will, increase, the, toxicity, of, tellurium, tellurium, is, not, reported, to, be, carcinogenic, but, it, may, be, fatal, if, inhaled, swallowed, or, absorbed, through, skin, humans, exposed, to, as, little, as, 0, 01, mg, m, 3, or, less, in, air, exude, a, foul, garlic, like, odor, known, as, tellurium, breath,

given, 15, mg, of, tellurium, still, had, this, characteristic, smell, on, their, breath, eight, months, later, in, laboratories, this, odor, makes, it, possible, to, discern, which, scientists, are, responsible, for, tellurium, chemistry, and, even, which, books, they, have, handled, in, the, past, even, though, the, metabolic, pathways, of, tellurium, are, not, known, it, is, generally, assumed, that, they, resemble, those, of, the, more, extensively, studied, selenium, because, the, final, methylated, metabolic, products, of, the, two, elements, are, similar, people, can, be, exposed, to,
