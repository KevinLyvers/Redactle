betelgeuse, is, a, red, supergiant, star, in, the, constellation, of, orion, it, is, usually, the, tenth, brightest, star, in, the, night, sky, and, after, rigel, the, second, brightest, in, its, constellation, it, is, a, distinctly, reddish, semiregular, variable, star, whose, apparent, magnitude, varying, between, 0, 0, and, 1, 6, has, the, widest, range, displayed, by, any, first, magnitude, star, betelgeuse, is, the, brightest, star, in, the, night, sky, at, near, infrared, wavelengths, its, bayer, designation, is, orionis, latinised, to, alpha, orionis, and, abbreviated, alpha, ori, or, ori, with, a, radius, between, 640, and, 764, times, that, of, the, sun, if, it, were, at, the, center, of, our, solar, system, its, surface, would, lie, beyond, the, asteroid, belt, and, it, would, engulf, the, orbits, of, mercury, venus, earth, and, mars, calculations, of, betelgeuse, s, mass, range, from, slightly, under, ten, to, a, little, over, twenty, times, that, of, the, sun, for, various, reasons, its, distance, has, been, quite, difficult, to, measure, current, best, estimates, are, of, the, order, of, 400, 600, light, years, from, the, sun, a, comparatively, wide, uncertainty, for, a, relatively, nearby, star, its, absolute, magnitude, is, about, 6, with, an, age, of, less, than, 10, million, years, betelgeuse, has, evolved, rapidly, because, of, its, large, mass, and, is, expected, to, end, its, evolution, with, a, supernova, explosion, most, likely, within, 100, 000, years, when, betelgeuse, explodes, it, will, shine, as, bright, as, the, half, moon, for, more, than, three, months, life, on, earth, will, be, unharmed, having, been, ejected, from, its, birthplace, in, the, orion, ob1, association, which, includes, the, stars, in, orion, s, belt, this, runaway, star, has, been, observed, to, be, moving, through, the, interstellar, medium, at, a, speed, of, 30, km, s, creating, a, bow, shock, over, four, light, years, wide, betelgeuse, became, the, first, extrasolar, star, whose, photosphere, s, angular, size, was, measured, in, 1920, and, subsequent, studies, have, reported, an, angular, diameter, i, e, apparent, size, ranging, from, 0, 042, to, 0, 056, arcseconds, that, range, of, determinations, is, ascribed, to, non, sphericity, limb, darkening, pulsations, and, varying, appearance, at, different, wavelengths, it, is, also, surrounded, by, a, complex, asymmetric, envelope, roughly, 250, times, the, size, of, the, star, caused, by, mass, loss, from, the, star, itself, the, earth, observed, angular, diameter, of, betelgeuse, is, exceeded, only, by, those, of, r, doradus, and, the, sun, starting, in, october, 2019, betelgeuse, began, to, dim, noticeably, and, by, mid, february, 2020, its, brightness, had, dropped, by, a, factor, of, approximately, 3, from, magnitude, 0, 5, to, 1, 7, it, then, returned, to, a, more, normal, brightness, range, reaching, a, peak, of, 0, 0, visual, and, 0, 1, v, band, magnitude, in, april, 2023, infrared, observations, found, no, significant, change, in, luminosity, over, the, last, 50, years, suggesting, that, the, dimming, was, due, to, a, change, in, extinction, around, the, star, rather, than, a, more, fundamental, change, a, study, using, the, hubble, space, telescope, suggests, that, occluding, dust, was, created, by, a, surface, mass, ejection, this, material, was, cast, millions, of, miles, from, the, star, and, then, cooled, to, form, the, dust, that, caused, the, dimming, the, star, s, designation, is, orionis, latinised, to, alpha, orionis, given, by, johann, bayer, in, 1603, the, traditional, name, betelgeuse, was, derived, from, the, arabic, yad, al, jawz, the, hand, of, al, jawz, an, error, in, the, 13th, century, reading, of, the, arabic, initial, y, as, b, a, difference, in, i, j, m, led, to, the, european, name, in, english, there, are, four, common, pronunciations, of, this, name, depending, on, whether, the, first, e, is, pronounced, short, or, long, and, whether, the, s, is, pronounced, s, or, z, in, 2016, the, international, astronomical, union, organized, a, working, group, on, star, names, wgsn, to, catalog, and, standardize, proper, names, for, stars, the, wgsn, s, first, bulletin, issued, july, 2016, included, a, table, of, the, first, two, batches, of, names, approved, by, the, wgsn, which, included, betelgeuse, for, this, star, it, is, now, so, entered, in, the, iau, catalog, of, star, names, betelgeuse, and, its, red, coloration, have, been, noted, since, antiquity, the, classical, astronomer, ptolemy, described, its, color, as, hyp, kirrhos, more, or, less, orange, tawny, a, term, later, described, by, a, translator, of, ulugh, beg, s, zij, i, sultani, as, rubedo, latin, for, ruddiness, in, the, 19th, century, before, modern, systems, of, stellar, classification, angelo, secchi, included, betelgeuse, as, one, of, the, prototypes, for, his, class, iii, orange, to, red, stars, three, centuries, before, ptolemy, in, contrast, chinese, astronomers, observed, betelgeuse, as, yellow, such, an, observation, if, accurate, could, suggest, the, star, was, in, a, yellow, supergiant, phase, around, this, time, a, credible, possibility, given, current, research, into, these, stars, complex, circumstellar, environment, aboriginal, groups, in, south, australia, have, shared, oral, tales, of, the, variable, brightness, of, betelgeuse, for, at, least, 1, 000, years, the, variation, in, betelgeuse, s, brightness, was, described, in, 1836, by, sir, john, herschel, in, outlines, of, astronomy, from, 1836, to, 1840, he, noticed, significant, changes, in, magnitude, when, betelgeuse, outshone, rigel, in, october, 1837, and, again, in, november, 1839, a, 10, year, quiescent, period, followed, then, in, 1849, herschel, noted, another, short, cycle, of, variability, which, peaked, in, 1852, later, observers, recorded, unusually, high, maxima, with, an, interval, of, years, but, only, small, variations, from, 1957, to, 1967, the, records, of, the, american, association, of, variable, star, observers, aavso, show, a, maximum, brightness, of, 0, 2, in, 1933, and, 1942, and, a, minimum, of, 1, 2, observed, in, 1927, and, 1941, this, variability, in, brightness, may, explain, why, johann, bayer, with, the, publication, of, his, uranometria, in, 1603, designated, the, star, alpha, as, it, probably, rivaled, the, usually, brighter, rigel, beta, from, arctic, latitudes, betelgeuse, s, red, colour, and, higher, location, in, the, sky, than, rigel, meant, the, inuit, regarded, it, as, brighter, and, one, local, name, was, ulluriajjuaq, large, star, in, 1920, albert, a, michelson, and, francis, g, pease, mounted, a, six, meter, interferometer, on, the, front, of, the, 2, 5, meter, telescope, at, mount, wilson, observatory, helped, by, john, august, anderson, the, trio, measured, the, angular, diameter, of, betelgeuse, at, 0, 047, a, figure, that, resulted, in, a, diameter, of, 3, 84, 10, 8, km, 2, 58, au, based, on, the, parallax, value, of, 0, 018, but, limb, darkening, and, measurement, errors, resulted, in, uncertainty, about, the, accuracy, of, these, measurements, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, saw, two, developments, that, affected, stellar, convection, theory, in, red, supergiants, the, stratoscope, projects, and, the, 1958, publication, of, structure, and, evolution, of, the, stars, principally, the, work, of, martin, schwarzschild, and, his, colleague, at, princeton, university, richard, h, rm, this, book, disseminated, ideas, on, how, to, apply, computer, technologies, to, create, stellar, models, while, the, stratoscope, projects, by, taking, balloon, borne, telescopes, above, the, earth, s, turbulence, produced, some, of, the, finest, images, of, solar, granules, and, sunspots, ever, seen, thus, confirming, the, existence, of, convection, in, the, solar, atmosphere, astronomers, saw, some, major, advances, in, astronomical, imaging, technology, in, the, 1970s, beginning, with, antoine, labeyrie, s, invention, of, speckle, interferometry, a, process, that, significantly, reduced, the, blurring, effect, caused, by, astronomical, seeing, it, increased, the, optical, resolution, of, ground, based, telescopes, allowing, for, more, precise, measurements, of, betelgeuse, s, photosphere, with, improvements, in, infrared, telescopy, atop, mount, wilson, mount, locke, and, mauna, kea, in, hawaii, astrophysicists, began, peering, into, the, complex, circumstellar, shells, surrounding, the, supergiant, causing, them, to, suspect, the, presence, of, huge, gas, bubbles, resulting, from, convection, however, it, was, not, until, the, late, 1980s, and, early, 1990s, when, betelgeuse, became, a, regular, target, for, aperture, masking, interferometry, that, breakthroughs, occurred, in, visible, light, and, infrared, imaging, pioneered, by, j, e, baldwin, and, colleagues, of, the, cavendish, astrophysics, group, the, new, technique, employed, a, small, mask, with, several, holes, in, the, telescope, pupil, plane, converting, the, aperture, into, an, ad, hoc, interferometric, array, the, technique, contributed, some, of, the, most, accurate, measurements, of, betelgeuse, while, revealing, bright, spots, on, the, star, s, photosphere, these, were, the, first, optical, and, infrared, images, of, a, stellar, disk, other, than, the, sun, taken, first, from, ground, based, interferometers, and, later, from, higher, resolution, observations, of, the, coast, telescope, the, bright, patches, or, hotspots, observed, with, these, instruments, appeared, to, corroborate, a, theory, put, forth, by, schwarzschild, decades, earlier, of, massive, convection, cells, dominating, the, stellar, surface, in, 1995, the, hubble, space, telescope, s, faint, object, camera, captured, an, ultraviolet, image, with, a, resolution, superior, to, that, obtained, by, ground, based, interferometers, the, first, conventional, telescope, image, or, direct, image, in, nasa, terminology, of, the, disk, of, another, star, because, ultraviolet, light, is, absorbed, by, the, earth, s, atmosphere, observations, at, these, wavelengths, are, best, performed, by, space, telescopes, this, image, like, earlier, pictures, contained, a, bright, patch, indicating, a, region, in, the, southwestern, quadrant, 2, 000, k, hotter, than, the, stellar, surface, subsequent, ultraviolet, spectra, taken, with, the, goddard, high, resolution, spectrograph, suggested, that, the, hot, spot, was, one, of, betelgeuse, s, poles, of, rotation, this, would, give, the, rotational, axis, an, inclination, of, about, 20, to, the, direction, of, earth, and, a, position, angle, from, celestial, north, of, about, 55, in, a, study, published, in, december, 2000, the, star, s, diameter, was, measured, with, the, infrared, spatial, interferometer, isi, at, mid, infrared, wavelengths, producing, a, limb, darkened, estimate, of, 55, 2, 0, 5, mas, a, figure, entirely, consistent, with, michelson, s, findings, eighty, years, earlier, at, the, time, of, its, publication, the, estimated, parallax, from, the, hipparcos, mission, was, 7, 63, 1, 64, mas, yielding, an, estimated, radius, for, betelgeuse, of, 3, 6, au, however, an, infrared, interferometric, study, published, in, 2009, announced, that, the, star, had, shrunk, by, 15, since, 1993, at, an, increasing, rate, without, a, significant, diminution, in, magnitude, subsequent, observations, suggest, that, the, apparent, contraction, may, be, due, to, shell, activity, in, the, star, s, extended, atmosphere, in, addition, to, the, star, s, diameter, questions, have, arisen, about, the, complex, dynamics, of, betelgeuse, s, extended, atmosphere, the, mass, that, makes, up, galaxies, is, recycled, as, stars, are, formed, and, destroyed, and, red, supergiants, are, major, contributors, yet, the, process, by, which, mass, is, lost, remains, a, mystery, with, advances, in, interferometric, methodologies, astronomers, may, be, close, to, resolving, this, conundrum, images, released, by, the, european, southern, observatory, in, july, 2009, taken, by, the, ground, based, very, large, telescope, interferometer, vlti, showed, a, vast, plume, of, gas, extending, 30, au, from, the, star, into, the, surrounding, atmosphere, this, mass, ejection, was, equal, to, the, distance, between, the, sun, and, neptune, and, is, one, of, multiple, events, occurring, in, betelgeuse, s, surrounding, atmosphere, astronomers, have, identified, at, least, six, shells, surrounding, betelgeuse, solving, the, mystery, of, mass, loss, in, the, late, stages, of, a, star, s, evolution, may, reveal, those, factors, that, precipitate, the, explosive, deaths, of, these, stellar, giants, a, pulsating, semiregular, variable, star, betelgeuse, is, subject, to, multiple, cycles, of, increasing, and, decreasing, brightness, due, to, changes, in, its, size, and, temperature, the, astronomers, who, first, noted, the, dimming, of, betelgeuse, villanova, university, astronomers, richard, wasatonic, and, edward, guinan, and, amateur, thomas, calderwood, theorize, that, a, coincidence, of, a, normal, 5, 9, year, light, cycle, minimum, and, a, deeper, than, normal, 425, day, period, are, the, driving, factors, other, possible, causes, hypothesized, by, late, 2019, were, an, eruption, of, gas, or, dust, or, fluctuations, in, the, star, s, surface, brightness, by, august, 2020, long, term, and, extensive, studies, of, betelgeuse, primarily, using, ultraviolet, observations, by, the, hubble, space, telescope, had, suggested, that, the, unexpected, dimming, was, probably, caused, by, an, immense, amount, of, superhot, material, ejected, into, space, the, material, cooled, and, formed, a, dust, cloud, that, blocked, the, starlight, coming, from, about, a, quarter, of, betelgeuse, s, surface, hubble, captured, signs, of, dense, heated, material, moving, through, the, star, s, atmosphere, in, september, october, and, november, before, several, telescopes, observed, the, more, marked, dimming, in, december, and, the, first, few, months, of, 2020, by, january, 2020, betelgeuse, had, dimmed, by, a, factor, of, approximately, 2, 5, from, magnitude, 0, 5, to, 1, 5, and, was, reported, still, fainter, in, february, in, the, astronomer, s, telegram, at, a, record, minimum, of, 1, 614, noting, that, the, star, is, currently, the, least, luminous, and, coolest, in, the, 25, years, of, their, studies, and, also, calculating, a, decrease, in, radius, astronomy, magazine, described, it, as, a, bizarre, dimming, and, popular, speculation, inferred, that, this, might, indicate, an, imminent, supernova, this, dropped, betelgeuse, from, one, of, the, top, 10, brightest, stars, in, the, sky, to, outside, the, top, 20, noticeably, dimmer, than, its, near, neighbor, aldebaran, mainstream, media, reports, discussed, speculation, that, betelgeuse, might, be, about, to, explode, as, a, supernova, but, astronomers, note, that, the, supernova, is, expected, to, occur, within, approximately, the, next, 100, 000, years, and, is, thus, unlikely, to, be, imminent, by, 17, february, 2020, betelgeuse, s, brightness, had, remained, constant, for, about, 10, days, and, the, star, showed, signs, of, rebrightening, on, 22, february, 2020, betelgeuse, may, have, stopped, dimming, altogether, all, but, ending, the, dimming, episode, on, 24, february, 2020, no, significant, change, in, the, infrared, over, the, last, 50, years, was, detected, this, seemed, unrelated, to, the, recent, visual, fading, and, suggested, that, an, impending, core, collapse, may, be, unlikely, also, on, 24, february, 2020, further, studies, suggested, that, occluding, large, grain, circumstellar, dust, may, be, the, most, likely, explanation, for, the, dimming, of, the, star, a, study, that, uses, observations, at, submillimetre, wavelengths, rules, out, significant, contributions, from, dust, absorption, instead, large, starspots, appear, to, be, the, cause, for, the, dimming, followup, studies, reported, on, 31, march, 2020, in, the, astronomer, s, telegram, found, a, rapid, rise, in, the, brightness, of, betelgeuse, betelgeuse, is, almost, unobservable, from, the, ground, between, may, and, august, because, it, is, too, close, to, the, sun, before, entering, its, 2020, conjunction, with, the, sun, betelgeuse, had, reached, a, brightness, of, 0, 4, observations, with, the, stereo, a, spacecraft, made, in, june, and, july, 2020, showed, that, the, star, had, dimmed, by, 0, 5, since, the, last, ground, based, observation, in, april, this, is, surprising, because, a, maximum, was, expected, for, august, september, 2020, and, the, next, minimum, should, occur, around, april, 2021, however, betelgeuse, s, brightness, is, known, to, vary, irregularly, making, predictions, difficult, the, fading, could, indicate, that, another, dimming, event, might, occur, much, earlier, than, expected, on, 30, august, 2020, astronomers, reported, the, detection, of, a, second, dust, cloud, emitted, from, betelgeuse, and, associated, with, recent, substantial, dimming, a, secondary, minimum, on, 3, august, in, luminosity, of, the, star, in, june, 2021, the, dust, was, explained, as, possibly, caused, by, a, cool, patch, on, its, photosphere, and, in, august, a, second, independent, group, confirmed, these, results, the, dust, is, thought, to, have, resulted, from, the, cooling, of, gas, ejected, from, the, star, an, august, 2022, study, using, the, hubble, space, telescope, confirmed, previous, research, and, suggested, the, dust, could, have, been, created, by, a, surface, mass, ejection, it, conjectured, as, well, that, the, dimming, could, have, come, from, a, short, term, minimum, coinciding, with, a, long, term, minimum, producing, a, grand, minimum, a, 416, day, cycle, and, 2010, day, cycle, respectively, a, mechanism, first, suggested, by, astronomer, l, goldberg, in, april, 2023, astronomers, reported, the, star, reached, a, peak, of, 0, 0, visual, and, 0, 1, v, band, magnitude, as, a, result, of, its, distinctive, orange, red, color, and, position, within, orion, betelgeuse, is, easy, to, find, with, the, naked, eye, it, is, one, of, three, stars, that, make, up, the, winter, triangle, asterism, and, it, marks, the, center, of, the, winter, hexagon, it, can, be, seen, rising, in, the, east, at, the, beginning, of, january, of, each, year, just, after, sunset, between, mid, september, and, mid, march, best, in, mid, december, it, is, visible, to, virtually, every, inhabited, region, of, the, globe, except, in, antarctica, at, latitudes, south, of, 82, in, may, moderate, northern, latitudes, or, june, southern, latitudes, the, red, supergiant, can, be, seen, briefly, on, the, western, horizon, after, sunset, reappearing, again, a, few, months, later, on, the, eastern, horizon, before, sunrise, in, the, intermediate, period, june, july, centered, around, mid, june, it, is, invisible, to, the, naked, eye, visible, only, with, a, telescope, in, daylight, except, around, midday, low, in, the, north, in, antarctic, regions, between, 70, and, 80, south, latitude, during, midday, twilight, in, polar, night, when, the, sun, is, below, the, horizon, betelgeuse, is, a, variable, star, whose, visual, magnitude, ranges, between, 0, 0, and, 1, 6, there, are, periods, during, which, it, surpasses, rigel, to, become, the, sixth, brightest, star, and, occasionally, it, will, become, even, brighter, than, capella, at, its, faintest, betelgeuse, can, fall, behind, deneb, and, beta, crucis, themselves, both, slightly, variable, to, be, the, twentieth, brightest, star, betelgeuse, has, a, b, v, color, index, of, 1, 85, a, figure, which, points, to, its, pronounced, redness, the, photosphere, has, an, extended, atmosphere, which, displays, strong, lines, of, emission, rather, than, absorption, a, phenomenon, that, occurs, when, a, star, is, surrounded, by, a, thick, gaseous, envelope, rather, than, ionized, this, extended, gaseous, atmosphere, has, been, observed, moving, toward, and, away, from, betelgeuse, depending, on, fluctuations, in, the, photosphere, betelgeuse, is, the, brightest, near, infrared, source, in, the, sky, with, a, j, band, magnitude, of, 2, 99, only, about, 13, of, the, star, s, radiant, energy, is, emitted, as, visible, light, if, human, eyes, were, sensitive, to, radiation, at, all, wavelengths, betelgeuse, would, appear, as, the, brightest, star, in, the, night, sky, catalogues, list, up, to, nine, faint, visual, companions, to, betelgeuse, they, are, at, distances, of, about, one, to, four, arc, minutes, and, all, are, fainter, than, 10th, magnitude, betelgeuse, is, generally, considered, to, be, a, single, isolated, star, and, a, runaway, star, not, currently, associated, with, any, cluster, or, star, forming, region, although, its, birthplace, is, unclear, two, spectroscopic, companions, to, betelgeuse, have, been, proposed, analysis, of, polarization, data, from, 1968, through, 1983, indicated, a, close, companion, with, a, periodic, orbit, of, about, 2, 1, years, and, by, using, speckle, interferometry, the, team, concluded, that, the, closer, of, the, two, companions, was, located, at, 0, 06, 0, 01, 9, au, from, the, main, star, with, a, position, angle, of, 273, an, orbit, that, would, potentially, place, it, within, the, star, s, chromosphere, the, more, distant, companion, was, at, 0, 51, 0, 01, 77, au, with, a, position, angle, of, 278, further, studies, have, found, no, evidence, for, these, companions, or, have, actively, refuted, their, existence, but, the, possibility, of, a, close, companion, contributing, to, the, overall, flux, has, never, been, fully, ruled, out, high, resolution, interferometry, of, betelgeuse, and, its, vicinity, far, beyond, the, technology, of, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, has, not, detected, any, companions, a, more, recent, study, found, that, an, unobservable, dust, modulating, stellar, mass, companion, of, 1, 17, 0, 7, m, would, be, the, most, likely, solution, for, betelgeuse, s, 2170, day, secondary, periodicity, fluctuating, radial, velocity, moderate, radius, and, low, variation, in, effective, temperature, the, candidate, companion, would, have, a, semi, major, axis, of, 8, 60, 0, 33, au, parallax, is, the, apparent, change, of, the, position, of, an, object, measured, in, seconds, of, arc, caused, by, the, change, of, position, of, the, observer, of, that, object, as, the, earth, orbits, the, sun, every, star, is, seen, to, shift, by, a, fraction, of, an, arc, second, which, measure, combined, with, the, baseline, provided, by, the, earth, s, orbit, gives, the, distance, to, that, star, since, the, first, successful, parallax, measurement, by, friedrich, bessel, in, 1838, astronomers, have, been, puzzled, by, betelgeuse, s, apparent, distance, knowledge, of, the, star, s, distance, improves, the, accuracy, of, other, stellar, parameters, such, as, luminosity, that, when, combined, with, an, angular, diameter, can, be, used, to, calculate, the, physical, radius, and, effective, temperature, luminosity, and, isotopic, abundances, can, also, be, used, to, estimate, the, stellar, age, and, mass, when, the, first, interferometric, studies, were, performed, on, the, star, s, diameter, in, 1920, the, assumed, parallax, was, 0, 0180, this, equated, to, a, distance, of, 56, pc, or, roughly, 180, ly, producing, not, only, an, inaccurate, radius, for, the, star, but, every, other, stellar, characteristic, since, then, there, has, been, ongoing, work, to, measure, the, distance, of, betelgeuse, with, proposed, distances, as, high, as, 400, pc, or, about, 1, 300, ly, before, the, publication, of, the, hipparcos, catalogue, 1997, there, were, two, slightly, conflicting, parallax, measurements, for, betelgeuse, the, first, in, 1991, gave, a, parallax, of, 9, 8, 4, 7, mas, yielding, a, distance, of, roughly, 102, pc, or, 330, ly, the, second, was, the, hipparcos, input, catalogue, 1993, with, a, trigonometric, parallax, of, 5, 4, mas, a, distance, of, 200, pc, or, 650, ly, given, this, uncertainty, researchers, were, adopting, a, wide, range, of, distance, estimates, leading, to, significant, variances, in, the, calculation, of, the, star, s, attributes, the, results, from, the, hipparcos, mission, were, released, in, 1997, the, measured, parallax, of, betelgeuse, was, 7, 63, 1, 64, mas, which, equated, to, a, distance, of, roughly, 131, pc, or, 427, ly, and, had, a, smaller, reported, error, than, previous, measurements, however, later, evaluation, of, the, hipparcos, parallax, measurements, for, variable, stars, like, betelgeuse, found, that, the, uncertainty, of, these, measurements, had, been, underestimated, in, 2007, an, improved, figure, of, 6, 55, 0, 83, was, calculated, hence, a, much, tighter, error, factor, yielding, a, distance, of, roughly, 152, 20, pc, or, 500, 65, ly, in, 2008, measurements, using, the, very, large, array, vla, produced, a, radio, solution, of, 5, 07, 1, 10, mas, equaling, a, distance, of, 197, 45, pc, or, 643, 146, ly, as, the, researcher, harper, points, out, the, revised, hipparcos, parallax, leads, to, a, larger, distance, 152, 20, pc, than, the, original, however, the, astrometric, solution, still, requires, a, significant, cosmic, noise, of, 2, 4, mas, given, these, results, it, is, clear, that, the, hipparcos, data, still, contain, systematic, errors, of, unknown, origin, although, the, radio, data, also, have, systematic, errors, the, harper, solution, combines, the, datasets, in, the, hope, of, mitigating, such, errors, an, updated, result, from, further, observations, with, alma, and, e, merlin, gives, a, parallax, of, 4, 51, 0, 8, mas, and, a, distance, of, 222, 34, 48, pc, or, 724, 111, 156, ly, in, 2020, new, observational, data, from, the, space, based, solar, mass, ejection, imager, aboard, the, coriolis, satellite, and, three, different, modeling, techniques, produced, a, refined, parallax, of, 5, 95, 0, 58, 0, 85, mas, a, radius, of, 764, 116, 62, r, and, a, distance, of, 168, 1, 27, 5, 14, 4, pc, or, 548, 90, 49, ly, which, if, accurate, would, mean, betelgeuse, is, nearly, 25, smaller, and, 25, closer, to, earth, than, previously, thought, although, the, european, space, agency, s, current, gaia, mission, was, not, expected, to, produce, good, results, for, stars, brighter, than, the, approximately, v, 6, saturation, limit, of, the, mission, s, instruments, actual, operation, has, shown, good, performance, on, objects, to, about, magnitude, 3, forced, observations, of, brighter, stars, mean, that, final, results, should, be, available, for, all, bright, stars, and, a, parallax, for, betelgeuse, will, be, published, an, order, of, magnitude, more, accurate, than, currently, available, there, is, no, data, on, betelgeuse, in, gaia, data, release, 2, which, was, released, in, 2018, betelgeuse, is, classified, as, a, semiregular, variable, star, indicating, that, some, periodicity, is, noticeable, in, the, brightness, changes, but, amplitudes, may, vary, cycles, may, have, different, lengths, and, there, may, be, standstills, or, periods, of, irregularity, it, is, placed, in, subgroup, src, these, are, pulsating, red, supergiants, with, amplitudes, around, one, magnitude, and, periods, from, tens, to, hundreds, of, days, betelgeuse, typically, shows, only, small, brightness, changes, near, to, magnitude, 0, 5, although, at, its, extremes, it, can, become, as, bright, as, magnitude, 0, 0, or, as, faint, as, magnitude, 1, 6, betelgeuse, is, listed, in, the, general, catalogue, of, variable, stars, with, a, possible, period, of, 2, 335, days, more, detailed, analyses, have, shown, a, main, period, near, 400, days, a, short, period, of, 185, days, and, a, longer, secondary, period, around, 2, 100, days, the, lowest, reliably, recorded, v, band, magnitude, of, 1, 614, was, reported, in, february, 2020, radial, pulsations, of, red, supergiants, are, well, modelled, and, show, that, periods, of, a, few, hundred, days, are, typically, due, to, fundamental, and, first, overtone, pulsation, lines, in, the, spectrum, of, betelgeuse, show, doppler, shifts, indicating, radial, velocity, changes, corresponding, very, roughly, to, the, brightness, changes, this, demonstrates, the, nature, of, the, pulsations, in, size, although, corresponding, temperature, and, spectral, variations, are, not, clearly, seen, variations, in, the, diameter, of, betelgeuse, have, also, been, measured, directly, first, overtone, pulsations, of, 185, days, have, been, observed, and, the, ratio, of, the, fundamental, to, overtone, periods, gives, valuable, information, about, the, internal, structure, of, the, star, and, its, age, the, source, of, the, long, secondary, periods, is, unknown, but, they, cannot, be, explained, by, radial, pulsations, interferometric, observations, of, betelgeuse, have, shown, hotspots, that, are, thought, to, be, created, by, massive, convection, cells, a, significant, fraction, of, the, diameter, of, the, star, and, each, emitting, 5, 10, of, the, total, light, of, the, star, one, theory, to, explain, long, secondary, periods, is, that, they, are, caused, by, the, evolution, of, such, cells, combined, with, the, rotation, of, the, star, other, theories, include, close, binary, interactions, chromospheric, magnetic, activity, influencing, mass, loss, or, non, radial, pulsations, such, as, g, modes, in, addition, to, the, discrete, dominant, periods, small, amplitude, stochastic, variations, are, seen, it, is, proposed, that, this, is, due, to, granulation, similar, to, the, same, effect, on, the, sun, but, on, a, much, larger, scale, on, 13, december, 1920, betelgeuse, became, the, first, star, outside, the, solar, system, to, have, the, angular, size, of, its, photosphere, measured, although, interferometry, was, still, in, its, infancy, the, experiment, proved, a, success, the, researchers, using, a, uniform, disk, model, determined, that, betelgeuse, had, a, diameter, of, 0, 047, although, the, stellar, disk, was, likely, 17, larger, due, to, the, limb, darkening, resulting, in, an, estimate, for, its, angular, diameter, of, about, 0, 055, since, then, other, studies, have, produced, angular, diameters, that, range, from, 0, 042, to, 0, 069, combining, these, data, with, historical, distance, estimates, of, 180, to, 815, ly, yields, a, projected, radius, of, the, stellar, disk, of, anywhere, from, 1, 2, to, 8, 9, au, using, the, solar, system, for, comparison, the, orbit, of, mars, is, about, 1, 5, au, ceres, in, the, asteroid, belt, 2, 7, au, jupiter, 5, 5, au, so, assuming, betelgeuse, occupying, the, place, of, the, sun, its, photosphere, might, extend, beyond, the, jovian, orbit, not, quite, reaching, saturn, at, 9, 5, au, the, precise, diameter, has, been, hard, to, define, for, several, reasons, the, generally, reported, radii, of, large, cool, stars, are, rosseland, radii, defined, as, the, radius, of, the, photosphere, at, a, specific, optical, depth, of, two, thirds, this, corresponds, to, the, radius, calculated, from, the, effective, temperature, and, bolometric, luminosity, the, rosseland, radius, differs, from, directly, measured, radii, with, corrections, for, limb, darkening, and, the, observation, wavelength, for, example, a, measured, angular, diameter, of, 55, 6, mas, would, correspond, to, a, rosseland, mean, diameter, of, 56, 2, mas, while, further, corrections, for, the, existence, of, surrounding, dust, and, gas, shells, would, give, a, diameter, of, 41, 9, mas, to, overcome, these, challenges, researchers, have, employed, various, solutions, astronomical, interferometry, first, conceived, by, hippolyte, fizeau, in, 1868, was, the, seminal, concept, that, has, enabled, major, improvements, in, modern, telescopy, and, led, to, the, creation, of, the, michelson, interferometer, in, the, 1880s, and, the, first, successful, measurement, of, betelgeuse, just, as, human, depth, perception, increases, when, two, eyes, instead, of, one, perceive, an, object, fizeau, proposed, the, observation, of, stars, through, two, apertures, instead, of, one, to, obtain, interferences, that, would, furnish, information, on, the, star, s, spatial, intensity, distribution, the, science, evolved, quickly, and, multiple, aperture, interferometers, are, now, used, to, capture, speckled, images, which, are, synthesized, using, fourier, analysis, to, produce, a, portrait, of, high, resolution, it, was, this, methodology, that, identified, the, hotspots, on, betelgeuse, in, the, 1990s, other, technological, breakthroughs, include, adaptive, optics, space, observatories, like, hipparcos, hubble, and, spitzer, and, the, astronomical, multi, beam, recombiner, amber, which, combines, the, beams, of, three, telescopes, simultaneously, allowing, researchers, to, achieve, milliarcsecond, spatial, resolution, observations, in, different, regions, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, the, visible, near, infrared, nir, mid, infrared, mir, or, radio, produce, very, different, angular, measurements, in, 1996, betelgeuse, was, shown, to, have, a, uniform, disk, of, 56, 6, 1, 0, mas, in, 2000, a, space, sciences, laboratory, team, measured, a, diameter, of, 54, 7, 0, 3, mas, ignoring, any, possible, contribution, from, hotspots, which, are, less, noticeable, in, the, mid, infrared, also, included, was, a, theoretical, allowance, for, limb, darkening, yielding, a, diameter, of, 55, 2, 0, 5, mas, the, earlier, estimate, equates, to, a, radius, of, roughly, 5, 6, au, or, 1, 200, r, assuming, the, 2008, harper, distance, of, 197, 0, 45, pc, a, figure, roughly, the, size, of, the, jovian, orbit, of, 5, 5, au, in, 2004, a, team, of, astronomers, working, in, the, near, infrared, announced, that, the, more, accurate, photospheric, measurement, was, 43, 33, 0, 04, mas, the, study, also, put, forth, an, explanation, as, to, why, varying, wavelengths, from, the, visible, to, mid, infrared, produce, different, diameters, the, star, is, seen, through, a, thick, warm, extended, atmosphere, at, short, wavelengths, the, visible, spectrum, the, atmosphere, scatters, light, thus, slightly, increasing, the, star, s, diameter, at, near, infrared, wavelengths, k, and, l, bands, the, scattering, is, negligible, so, the, classical, photosphere, can, be, directly, seen, in, the, mid, infrared, the, scattering, increases, once, more, causing, the, thermal, emission, of, the, warm, atmosphere, to, increase, the, apparent, diameter, studies, with, the, iota, and, vlti, published, in, 2009, brought, strong, support, to, the, idea, of, dust, shells, and, a, molecular, shell, molsphere, around, betelgeuse, and, yielded, diameters, ranging, from, 42, 57, to, 44, 28, mas, with, comparatively, insignificant, margins, of, error, in, 2011, a, third, estimate, in, the, near, infrared, corroborating, the, 2009, numbers, this, time, showing, a, limb, darkened, disk, diameter, of, 42, 49, 0, 06, mas, the, near, infrared, photospheric, diameter, of, 43, 33, mas, at, the, hipparcos, distance, of, 152, 20, pc, equates, to, about, 3, 4, au, or, 730, r, a, 2014, paper, derives, an, angular, diameter, of, 42, 28, mas, equivalent, to, a, 41, 01, mas, uniform, disc, using, h, and, k, band, observations, made, with, the, vlti, amber, instrument, in, 2009, it, was, announced, that, the, radius, of, betelgeuse, had, shrunk, from, 1993, to, 2009, by, 15, with, the, 2008, angular, measurement, equal, to, 47, 0, mas, unlike, most, earlier, papers, this, study, used, measurements, at, one, specific, wavelength, over, 15, years, the, diminution, in, betelgeuse, s, apparent, size, equates, to, a, range, of, values, between, 56, 0, 0, 1, mas, seen, in, 1993, to, 47, 0, 0, 1, mas, seen, in, 2008, a, contraction, of, almost, 0, 9, au, in, 15, years, the, observed, contraction, is, generally, believed, to, be, a, variation, in, just, a, portion, of, the, extended, atmosphere, around, betelgeuse, and, observations, at, other, wavelengths, have, shown, an, increase, in, diameter, over, a, similar, period, the, latest, models, of, betelgeuse, adopt, a, photospheric, angular, diameter, of, around, 43, mas, with, multiple, shells, out, to, 50, 60, mas, assuming, a, distance, of, 197, pc, this, means, a, stellar, diameter, of, 887, 203, r, once, considered, as, having, the, largest, angular, diameter, of, any, star, in, the, sky, after, the, sun, betelgeuse, lost, that, distinction, in, 1997, when, a, group, of, astronomers, measured, r, doradus, with, a, diameter, of, 57, 0, 0, 5, mas, although, r, doradus, being, much, closer, to, earth, at, about, 200, ly, has, a, linear, diameter, roughly, one, third, that, of, betelgeuse, betelgeuse, is, too, far, from, the, ecliptic, to, be, occulted, by, the, major, planets, but, those, by, some, asteroids, which, are, more, wide, ranging, and, much, more, numerous, occur, frequently, a, partial, occultation, by, the, 19th, magnitude, asteroid, 147857, 2005, uw, 381, occurred, on, 2, january, 2012, it, was, partial, because, the, angular, diameter, of, the, star, was, larger, than, that, of, the, asteroid, the, brightness, of, betelgeuse, dropped, by, only, about, 0, 01, magnitudes, the, 14th, magnitude, asteroid, 319, leona, was, predicted, to, occult, on, 12, december, 2023, 01, 12, utc, totality, was, at, first, uncertain, and, the, occulation, was, projected, to, only, last, approximately, twelve, seconds, visible, on, a, narrow, path, on, earth, s, surface, the, exact, width, and, location, of, which, was, initially, uncertain, due, to, lack, of, precise, knowledge, of, the, size, and, path, of, the, asteroid, projections, were, later, refined, as, more, data, were, analyzed, for, a, totality, ring, of, fire, of, approximately, five, seconds, and, a, 60, km, wide, path, stretching, from, tajikistan, armenia, turkey, greece, italy, spain, the, atlantic, ocean, miami, florida, and, the, florida, keys, to, parts, of, mexico, the, serendiptous, event, would, also, afford, detailed, observations, of, 319, leona, itself, among, other, programmes, 80, amateur, astronomers, in, europe, alone, have, been, coordinated, by, astrophysicist, miguel, montarg, s, et, al, of, the, paris, observatory, for, the, event, betelgeuse, is, a, very, large, luminous, but, cool, star, classified, as, an, m1, 2, ia, ab, red, supergiant, the, letter, m, in, this, designation, means, that, it, is, a, red, star, belonging, to, the, m, spectral, class, and, therefore, has, a, relatively, low, photospheric, temperature, the, ia, ab, suffix, luminosity, class, indicates, that, it, is, an, intermediate, luminosity, supergiant, with, properties, partway, between, a, normal, supergiant, and, a, luminous, supergiant, since, 1943, the, spectrum, of, betelgeuse, has, served, as, one, of, the, stable, anchor, points, by, which, other, stars, are, classified, uncertainty, in, the, star, s, surface, temperature, diameter, and, distance, make, it, difficult, to, achieve, a, precise, measurement, of, betelgeuse, s, luminosity, but, research, from, 2012, quotes, a, luminosity, of, around, 126, 000, l, assuming, a, distance, of, 200, pc, studies, since, 2001, report, effective, temperatures, ranging, from, 3, 250, to, 3, 690, k, values, outside, this, range, have, previously, been, reported, and, much, of, the, variation, is, believed, to, be, real, due, to, pulsations, in, the, atmosphere, the, star, is, also, a, slow, rotator, and, the, most, recent, velocity, recorded, was, 5, 45, km, s, much, slower, than, antares, which, has, a, rotational, velocity, of, 20, km, s, the, rotation, period, depends, on, betelgeuse, s, size, and, orientation, to, earth, but, it, has, been, calculated, to, take, 36, years, to, turn, on, its, axis, inclined, at, an, angle, of, around, 60, to, earth, in, 2004, astronomers, using, computer, simulations, speculated, that, even, if, betelgeuse, is, not, rotating, it, might, exhibit, large, scale, magnetic, activity, in, its, extended, atmosphere, a, factor, where, even, moderately, strong, fields, could, have, a, meaningful, influence, over, the, star, s, dust, wind, and, mass, loss, properties, a, series, of, spectropolarimetric, observations, obtained, in, 2010, with, the, bernard, lyot, telescope, at, pic, du, midi, observatory, revealed, the, presence, of, a, weak, magnetic, field, at, the, surface, of, betelgeuse, suggesting, that, the, giant, convective, motions, of, supergiant, stars, are, able, to, trigger, the, onset, of, a, small, scale, dynamo, effect, betelgeuse, has, no, known, orbital, companions, so, its, mass, cannot, be, calculated, by, that, direct, method, modern, mass, estimates, from, theoretical, modelling, have, produced, values, of, 9, 5, 21, m, with, values, of, 5, m, 30, m, from, older, studies, it, has, been, calculated, that, betelgeuse, began, its, life, as, a, star, of, 15, 20, m, based, on, a, solar, luminosity, of, 90, 000, 150, 000, a, novel, method, of, determining, the, supergiant, s, mass, was, proposed, in, 2011, arguing, for, a, current, stellar, mass, of, 11, 6, m, with, an, upper, limit, of, 16, 6, and, lower, of, 7, 7, m, based, on, observations, of, the, star, s, intensity, profile, from, narrow, h, band, interferometry, and, using, a, photospheric, measurement, of, roughly, 4, 3, au, or, 955, 217, r, a, probablystic, age, prior, analysis, give, a, current, mass, of, 16, 5, 19, m, and, an, initial, mass, of, 18, 21, m, betelgeuse, s, mass, can, also, be, estimated, based, on, its, position, on, the, color, magnitude, diagram, cmd, betelgeuse, s, color, may, have, changed, from, yellow, or, possibly, orange, i, e, a, yellow, supergiant, to, red, in, the, last, few, thousand, years, based, on, a, 2022, review, of, historical, records, this, color, change, combined, with, the, cmd, suggest, a, mass, of, 14, m, and, age, of, 14, myr, and, a, distance, from, 125, to, 150, parsecs, 400, to, 500, light, years, the, kinematics, of, betelgeuse, are, complex, the, age, of, class, m, supergiants, with, an, initial, mass, of, 20, m, is, roughly, 10, million, years, starting, from, its, present, position, and, motion, a, projection, back, in, time, would, place, betelgeuse, around, 290, parsecs, farther, from, the, galactic, plane, an, implausible, location, as, there, is, no, star, formation, region, there, moreover, betelgeuse, s, projected, pathway, does, not, appear, to, intersect, with, the, 25, ori, subassociation, or, the, far, younger, orion, nebula, cluster, onc, also, known, as, ori, ob1d, particularly, since, very, long, baseline, array, astrometry, yields, a, distance, from, betelgeuse, to, the, onc, of, between, 389, and, 414, parsecs, consequently, it, is, likely, that, betelgeuse, has, not, always, had, its, current, motion, through, space, but, has, changed, course, at, one, time, or, another, possibly, the, result, of, a, nearby, stellar, explosion, an, observation, by, the, herschel, space, observatory, in, january, 2013, revealed, that, the, star, s, winds, are, crashing, against, the, surrounding, interstellar, medium, the, most, likely, star, formation, scenario, for, betelgeuse, is, that, it, is, a, runaway, star, from, the, orion, ob1, association, originally, a, member, of, a, high, mass, multiple, system, within, ori, ob1a, betelgeuse, was, probably, formed, about, 10, 12, million, years, ago, but, has, evolved, rapidly, due, to, its, high, mass, h, bouy, and, j, alves, suggested, in, 2015, that, betelgeuse, may, instead, be, a, member, of, the, newly, discovered, taurion, ob, association, in, the, late, phase, of, stellar, evolution, massive, stars, like, betelgeuse, exhibit, high, rates, of, mass, loss, possibly, as, much, as, one, m, every, 10, 000, years, resulting, in, a, complex, circumstellar, environment, that, is, constantly, in, flux, in, a, 2009, paper, stellar, mass, loss, was, cited, as, the, key, to, understanding, the, evolution, of, the, universe, from, the, earliest, cosmological, times, to, the, current, epoch, and, of, planet, formation, and, the, formation, of, life, itself, however, the, physical, mechanism, is, not, well, understood, when, martin, schwarzschild, first, proposed, his, theory, of, huge, convection, cells, he, argued, it, was, the, likely, cause, of, mass, loss, in, evolved, supergiants, like, betelgeuse, recent, work, has, corroborated, this, hypothesis, yet, there, are, still, uncertainties, about, the, structure, of, their, convection, the, mechanism, of, their, mass, loss, the, way, dust, forms, in, their, extended, atmosphere, and, the, conditions, which, precipitate, their, dramatic, finale, as, a, type, ii, supernova, in, 2001, graham, harper, estimated, a, stellar, wind, at, 0, 03, m, every, 10, 000, years, but, research, since, 2009, has, provided, evidence, of, episodic, mass, loss, making, any, total, figure, for, betelgeuse, uncertain, current, observations, suggest, that, a, star, like, betelgeuse, may, spend, a, portion, of, its, lifetime, as, a, red, supergiant, but, then, cross, back, across, the, h, r, diagram, pass, once, again, through, a, brief, yellow, supergiant, phase, and, then, explode, as, a, blue, supergiant, or, wolf, rayet, star, astronomers, may, be, close, to, solving, this, mystery, they, noticed, a, large, plume, of, gas, extending, at, least, six, times, its, stellar, radius, indicating, that, betelgeuse, is, not, shedding, matter, evenly, in, all, directions, the, plume, s, presence, implies, that, the, spherical, symmetry, of, the, star, s, photosphere, often, observed, in, the, infrared, is, not, preserved, in, its, close, environment, asymmetries, on, the, stellar, disk, had, been, reported, at, different, wavelengths, however, due, to, the, refined, capabilities, of, the, naco, adaptive, optics, on, the, vlt, these, asymmetries, have, come, into, focus, the, two, mechanisms, that, could, cause, such, asymmetrical, mass, loss, were, large, scale, convection, cells, or, polar, mass, loss, possibly, due, to, rotation, probing, deeper, with, eso, s, amber, gas, in, the, supergiant, s, extended, atmosphere, has, been, observed, vigorously, moving, up, and, down, creating, bubbles, as, large, as, the, supergiant, itself, leading, his, team, to, conclude, that, such, stellar, upheaval, is, behind, the, massive, plume, ejection, observed, by, kervella, in, addition, to, the, photosphere, six, other, components, of, betelgeuse, s, atmosphere, have, now, been, identified, they, are, a, molecular, environment, otherwise, known, as, the, molsphere, a, gaseous, envelope, a, chromosphere, a, dust, environment, and, two, outer, shells, s1, and, s2, composed, of, carbon, monoxide, co, some, of, these, elements, are, known, to, be, asymmetric, while, others, overlap, at, about, 0, 45, stellar, radii, 2, 3, au, above, the, photosphere, there, may, lie, a, molecular, layer, known, as, the, molsphere, or, molecular, environment, studies, show, it, to, be, composed, of, water, vapor, and, carbon, monoxide, with, an, effective, temperature, of, about, 1, 500, 500, k, water, vapor, had, been, originally, detected, in, the, supergiant, s, spectrum, in, the, 1960s, with, the, two, stratoscope, projects, but, had, been, ignored, for, decades, the, molsphere, may, also, contain, sio, and, al, 2, o, 3, molecules, which, could, explain, the, formation, of, dust, particles, another, cooler, region, the, asymmetric, gaseous, envelope, extends, for, several, radii, 10, 40, au, from, the, photosphere, it, is, enriched, in, oxygen, and, especially, in, nitrogen, relative, to, carbon, these, composition, anomalies, are, likely, caused, by, contamination, by, cno, processed, material, from, the, inside, of, betelgeuse, radio, telescope, images, taken, in, 1998, confirm, that, betelgeuse, has, a, highly, complex, atmosphere, with, a, temperature, of, 3, 450, 850, k, similar, to, that, recorded, on, the, star, s, surface, but, much, lower, than, surrounding, gas, in, the, same, region, the, vla, images, also, show, this, lower, temperature, gas, progressively, cools, as, it, extends, outward, although, unexpected, it, turns, out, to, be, the, most, abundant, constituent, of, betelgeuse, s, atmosphere, this, alters, our, basic, understanding, of, red, supergiant, star, atmospheres, explained, jeremy, lim, the, team, s, leader, instead, of, the, star, s, atmosphere, expanding, uniformly, due, to, gas, heated, to, high, temperatures, near, its, surface, it, now, appears, that, several, giant, convection, cells, propel, gas, from, the, star, s, surface, into, its, atmosphere, this, is, the, same, region, in, which, kervella, s, 2009, finding, of, a, bright, plume, possibly, containing, carbon, and, nitrogen, and, extending, at, least, six, photospheric, radii, in, the, southwest, direction, of, the, star, is, believed, to, exist, the, chromosphere, was, directly, imaged, by, the, faint, object, camera, on, board, the, hubble, space, telescope, in, ultraviolet, wavelengths, the, images, also, revealed, a, bright, area, in, the, southwest, quadrant, of, the, disk, the, average, radius, of, the, chromosphere, in, 1996, was, about, 2, 2, times, the, optical, disk, 10, au, and, was, reported, to, have, a, temperature, no, higher, than, 5, 500, k, however, in, 2004, observations, with, the, stis, hubble, s, high, precision, spectrometer, pointed, to, the, existence, of, warm, chromospheric, plasma, at, least, one, arcsecond, away, from, the, star, at, a, distance, of, 197, pc, the, size, of, the, chromosphere, could, be, up, to, 200, au, the, observations, have, conclusively, demonstrated, that, the, warm, chromospheric, plasma, spatially, overlaps, and, co, exists, with, cool, gas, in, betelgeuse, s, gaseous, envelope, as, well, as, with, the, dust, in, its, circumstellar, dust, shells, the, first, claim, of, a, dust, shell, surrounding, betelgeuse, was, put, forth, in, 1977, when, it, was, noted, that, dust, shells, around, mature, stars, often, emit, large, amounts, of, radiation, in, excess, of, the, photospheric, contribution, using, heterodyne, interferometry, it, was, concluded, that, the, red, supergiant, emits, most, of, its, excess, radiation, from, positions, beyond, 12, stellar, radii, or, roughly, the, distance, of, the, kuiper, belt, at, 50, to, 60, au, which, depends, on, the, assumed, stellar, radius, since, then, there, have, been, studies, done, of, this, dust, envelope, at, varying, wavelengths, yielding, decidedly, different, results, studies, from, the, 1990s, have, estimated, the, inner, radius, of, the, dust, shell, anywhere, from, 0, 5, to, 1, 0, arcseconds, or, 100, to, 200, au, these, studies, point, out, that, the, dust, environment, surrounding, betelgeuse, is, not, static, in, 1994, it, was, reported, that, betelgeuse, undergoes, sporadic, decades, long, dust, production, followed, by, inactivity, in, 1997, significant, changes, in, the, dust, shell, s, morphology, in, one, year, were, noted, suggesting, that, the, shell, is, asymmetrically, illuminated, by, a, stellar, radiation, field, strongly, affected, by, the, existence, of, photospheric, hotspots, the, 1984, report, of, a, giant, asymmetric, dust, shell, 1, pc, 206, 265, au, has, not, been, corroborated, by, recent, studies, although, another, published, the, same, year, said, that, three, dust, shells, were, found, extending, four, light, years, from, one, side, of, the, decaying, star, suggesting, that, betelgeuse, sheds, its, outer, layers, as, it, moves, although, the, exact, size, of, the, two, outer, co, shells, remains, elusive, preliminary, estimates, suggest, that, one, shell, extends, from, about, 1, 5, to, 4, 0, arcseconds, and, the, other, expands, as, far, as, 7, 0, arcseconds, assuming, the, jovian, orbit, of, 5, 5, au, as, the, star, radius, the, inner, shell, would, extend, roughly, 50, to, 150, stellar, radii, 300, to, 800, au, with, the, outer, one, as, far, as, 250, stellar, radii, 1, 400, au, the, sun, s, heliopause, is, estimated, at, 100, au, so, the, size, of, this, outer, shell, would, be, almost, fourteen, times, the, size, of, the, solar, system, betelgeuse, is, travelling, supersonically, through, the, interstellar, medium, at, a, speed, of, 30, km, s, i, e, 6, 3, au, a, creating, a, bow, shock, the, shock, is, not, created, by, the, star, but, by, its, powerful, stellar, wind, as, it, ejects, vast, amounts, of, gas, into, the, interstellar, medium, at, a, speed, of, 17, km, s, heating, the, material, surrounding, the, star, thereby, making, it, visible, in, infrared, light, because, betelgeuse, is, so, bright, it, was, only, in, 1997, that, the, bow, shock, was, first, imaged, the, cometary, structure, is, estimated, to, be, at, least, one, parsec, wide, assuming, a, distance, of, 643, light, years, hydrodynamic, simulations, of, the, bow, shock, made, in, 2012, indicate, that, it, is, very, young, less, than, 30, 000, years, old, suggesting, two, possibilities, that, betelgeuse, moved, into, a, region, of, the, interstellar, medium, with, different, properties, only, recently, or, that, betelgeuse, has, undergone, a, significant, transformation, producing, a, changed, stellar, wind, a, 2012, paper, proposed, that, this, phenomenon, was, caused, by, betelgeuse, transitioning, from, a, blue, supergiant, bsg, to, a, red, supergiant, rsg, there, is, evidence, that, in, the, late, evolutionary, stage, of, a, star, like, betelgeuse, such, stars, may, undergo, rapid, transitions, from, red, to, blue, and, vice, versa, on, the, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, with, accompanying, rapid, changes, to, their, stellar, winds, and, bow, shocks, moreover, if, future, research, bears, out, this, hypothesis, betelgeuse, may, prove, to, have, traveled, close, to, 200, 000, au, as, a, red, supergiant, scattering, as, much, as, 3, m, along, its, trajectory, betelgeuse, is, a, red, supergiant, that, has, evolved, from, an, o, type, main, sequence, star, after, core, hydrogen, exhaustion, betelgeuse, evolved, into, a, blue, supergiant, before, evolving, into, its, current, red, supergiant, form, its, core, will, eventually, collapse, producing, a, supernova, explosion, and, leaving, behind, a, compact, remnant, the, details, depend, on, the, exact, initial, mass, and, other, physical, properties, of, that, main, sequence, star, the, initial, mass, of, betelgeuse, can, only, be, estimated, by, testing, different, stellar, evolutionary, models, to, match, its, current, observed, properties, the, unknowns, of, both, the, models, and, the, current, properties, mean, that, there, is, considerable, uncertainty, in, betelgeuse, s, initial, appearance, but, its, mass, is, usually, estimated, to, have, been, in, the, range, of, 10, 25, m, with, modern, models, finding, values, of, 15, 20, m, its, chemical, makeup, can, be, reasonably, assumed, to, have, been, around, 70, hydrogen, 28, helium, and, 2, 4, heavy, elements, slightly, more, metal, rich, than, the, sun, but, otherwise, similar, the, initial, rotation, rate, is, more, uncertain, but, models, with, slow, to, moderate, initial, rotation, rates, produce, the, best, matches, to, betelgeuse, s, current, properties, that, main, sequence, version, of, betelgeuse, would, have, been, a, hot, luminous, star, with, a, spectral, type, such, as, o9v, a, 15, m, star, would, take, between, 11, 5, and, 15, million, years, to, reach, the, red, supergiant, stage, with, more, rapidly, rotating, stars, taking, the, longest, rapidly, rotating, 20, m, stars, take, 9, 3, million, years, to, reach, the, red, supergiant, stage, while, 20, m, stars, with, slow, rotation, take, only, 8, 1, million, years, these, are, the, best, estimates, of, betelgeuse, s, current, age, as, the, time, since, its, zero, age, main, sequence, stage, is, estimated, to, be, 8, 0, 8, 5, million, years, as, a, 20, m, star, with, no, rotation, betelgeuse, s, time, spent, as, a, red, supergiant, can, be, estimated, by, comparing, mass, loss, rates, to, the, observed, circumstellar, material, as, well, as, the, abundances, of, heavy, elements, at, the, surface, estimates, range, from, 10, 000, years, to, a, maximum, of, 140, 000, years, betelgeuse, appears, to, undergo, short, periods, of, heavy, mass, loss, and, is, a, runaway, star, moving, rapidly, through, space, so, comparisons, of, its, current, mass, loss, to, the, total, lost, mass, are, difficult, the, surface, of, betelgeuse, shows, enhancement, of, nitrogen, relatively, low, levels, of, carbon, and, a, high, proportion, of, 13, c, relative, to, 12, c, all, indicative, of, a, star, that, has, experienced, the, first, dredge, up, however, the, first, dredge, up, occurs, soon, after, a, star, reaches, the, red, supergiant, phase, and, so, this, only, means, that, betelgeuse, has, been, a, red, supergiant, for, at, least, a, few, thousand, years, the, best, prediction, is, that, betelgeuse, has, already, spent, around, 40, 000, years, as, a, red, supergiant, having, left, the, main, sequence, perhaps, one, million, years, ago, the, current, mass, can, be, estimated, from, evolutionary, models, from, the, initial, mass, and, the, expected, mass, lost, so, far, for, betelgeuse, the, total, mass, lost, is, predicted, to, be, no, more, than, about, one, m, giving, a, current, mass, of, 19, 4, 19, 7, m, considerably, higher, than, estimated, by, other, means, such, as, pulsational, properties, or, limb, darkening, models, all, stars, more, massive, than, about, 10, m, are, expected, to, end, their, lives, when, their, cores, collapse, typically, producing, a, supernova, explosion, up, to, about, 15, m, a, type, ii, p, supernova, is, always, produced, from, the, red, supergiant, stage, more, massive, stars, can, lose, mass, quickly, enough, that, they, evolve, towards, higher, temperatures, before, their, cores, can, collapse, particularly, for, rotating, stars, and, models, with, especially, high, mass, loss, rates, these, stars, can, produce, type, ii, l, or, type, iib, supernovae, from, yellow, or, blue, supergiants, or, type, i, b, c, supernovae, from, wolf, rayet, stars, models, of, rotating, 20, m, stars, predict, a, peculiar, type, ii, supernova, similar, to, sn, 1987a, from, a, blue, supergiant, progenitor, on, the, other, hand, non, rotating, 20, m, models, predict, a, type, ii, p, supernova, from, a, red, supergiant, progenitor, the, time, until, betelgeuse, explodes, depends, on, the, predicted, initial, conditions, and, on, the, estimate, of, the, time, already, spent, as, a, red, supergiant, the, total, lifetime, from, the, start, of, the, red, supergiant, phase, to, core, collapse, varies, from, about, 300, 000, years, for, a, rotating, 25, m, star, 550, 000, years, for, a, rotating, 20, m, star, and, up, to, a, million, years, for, a, non, rotating, 15, m, star, given, the, estimated, time, since, betelgeuse, became, a, red, supergiant, estimates, of, its, remaining, lifetime, range, from, a, best, guess, of, under, 100, 000, years, for, a, non, rotating, 20, m, model, to, far, longer, for, rotating, models, or, lower, mass, stars, betelgeuse, s, suspected, birthplace, in, the, orion, ob1, association, is, the, location, of, several, previous, supernovae, it, is, believed, that, runaway, stars, may, be, caused, by, supernovae, and, there, is, strong, evidence, that, ob, stars, columbae, ae, aurigae, and, 53, arietis, all, originated, from, such, explosions, in, ori, ob1, 2, 2, 2, 7, and, 4, 9, million, years, ago, a, typical, type, ii, p, supernova, emits, 2, 10, 46, j, of, neutrinos, and, produces, an, explosion, with, a, kinetic, energy, of, 2, 10, 44, j, as, seen, from, earth, betelgeuse, as, a, type, iip, supernova, would, have, a, peak, apparent, magnitude, somewhere, in, the, range, 8, to, 12, this, would, be, easily, visible, in, daylight, with, a, possible, brightness, up, to, a, significant, fraction, of, the, full, moon, though, likely, not, exceeding, it, this, type, of, supernova, would, remain, at, roughly, constant, brightness, for, 2, 3, months, before, rapidly, dimming, the, visible, light, is, produced, mainly, by, the, radioactive, decay, of, cobalt, and, sustains, its, brightness, due, to, the, increasing, transparency, of, the, cooling, hydrogen, ejected, by, the, supernova, due, to, misunderstandings, caused, by, the, 2009, publication, of, the, star, s, 15, contraction, apparently, of, its, outer, atmosphere, betelgeuse, has, frequently, been, the, subject, of, scare, stories, and, rumors, suggesting, that, it, will, explode, within, a, year, and, leading, to, exaggerated, claims, about, the, consequences, of, such, an, event, the, timing, and, prevalence, of, these, rumors, have, been, linked, to, broader, misconceptions, of, astronomy, particularly, to, doomsday, predictions, relating, to, the, mayan, calendrical, apocalypse, betelgeuse, is, not, likely, to, produce, a, gamma, ray, burst, and, is, not, close, enough, for, its, x, rays, ultraviolet, radiation, or, ejected, material, to, cause, significant, effects, on, earth, following, the, dimming, of, betelgeuse, in, december, 2019, reports, appeared, in, the, science, and, mainstream, media, that, again, included, speculation, that, the, star, might, be, about, to, explode, as, a, supernova, even, in, the, face, of, scientific, research, that, a, supernova, is, not, expected, for, perhaps, 100, 000, years, some, outlets, reported, the, magnitude, as, faint, as, 1, 3, as, an, unusual, and, interesting, phenomenon, like, astronomy, magazine, the, national, geographic, and, the, smithsonian, some, mainstream, media, like, the, washington, post, abc, news, in, australia, and, popular, science, reported, that, a, supernova, was, possible, but, unlikely, whilst, other, outlets, falsely, portrayed, a, supernova, as, an, imminent, realistic, possibility, cnn, for, example, chose, the, headline, a, giant, red, star, is, acting, weird, and, scientists, think, it, may, be, about, to, explode, while, the, new, york, post, declared, betelgeuse, as, due, for, explosive, supernova, phil, plait, in, his, bad, astronomy, blog, noting, that, betelgeuse, s, recent, behaviour, hile, unusual, isn, t, unprecedented, argued, that, the, star, is, not, likely, to, explode, for, a, long, long, time, dennis, overbye, of, the, new, york, times, agreed, that, an, explosion, was, not, imminent, but, added, that, astronomers, are, having, fun, thinking, about, it, following, the, eventual, supernova, a, small, dense, remnant, will, be, left, behind, either, a, neutron, star, or, black, hole, betelgeuse, does, not, seem, to, have, a, core, massive, enough, for, a, black, hole, so, the, remnant, will, probably, be, a, neutron, star, of, approximately, 1, 5, m, betelgeuse, has, also, been, spelled, betelgeux, and, in, german, beteigeuze, according, to, bode, betelgeux, and, betelgeuze, were, used, until, the, early, 20th, century, when, the, spelling, betelgeuse, became, universal, consensus, on, its, pronunciation, is, weak, and, is, as, varied, as, its, spellings, the, urz, pronunciations, are, attempts, to, render, the, french, eu, sound, they, only, work, in, r, dropping, accents, betelgeuse, is, often, mistranslated, as, armpit, of, the, central, one, in, his, 1899, work, star, names, and, their, meanings, american, amateur, naturalist, richard, hinckley, allen, stated, the, derivation, was, from, the, ib, al, jauzah, which, he, claimed, degenerated, into, a, number, of, forms, including, bed, elgueze, beit, algueze, bet, el, gueze, and, beteigeuze, to, the, forms, betelgeuse, betelguese, betelgueze, and, betelgeux, the, star, was, named, beldengeuze, in, the, alfonsine, tables, and, italian, jesuit, priest, and, astronomer, giovanni, battista, riccioli, had, called, it, bectelgeuze, or, bedalgeuze, paul, kunitzsch, professor, of, arabic, studies, at, the, university, of, munich, refuted, allen, s, derivation, and, instead, proposed, that, the, full, name, is, a, corruption, of, the, arabic, yad, al, jauz, meaning, the, hand, of, al, jauz, i, e, orion, european, mistransliteration, into, medieval, latin, led, to, the, first, character, y, with, two, dots, underneath, being, misread, as, a, b, with, only, one, dot, underneath, during, the, renaissance, the, star, s, name, was, written, as, bait, al, jauz, house, of, orion, or, ba, al, jauz, incorrectly, thought, to, mean, armpit, of, orion, a, true, translation, of, armpit, would, be, transliterated, as, ib, this, led, to, the, modern, rendering, as, betelgeuse, other, writers, have, since, accepted, kunitzsch, s, explanation, the, last, part, of, the, name, elgeuse, comes, from, the, arabic, al, jauz, a, historical, arabic, name, of, the, constellation, orion, a, feminine, name, in, old, arabian, legend, and, of, uncertain, meaning, because, j, w, z, the, root, of, jauz, means, middle, al, jauz, roughly, means, the, central, one, the, modern, arabic, name, for, orion, is, al, jabb, r, the, giant, although, the, use, of, al, jauz, in, the, star, s, name, has, continued, the, 17th, century, english, translator, edmund, chilmead, gave, it, the, name, ied, algeuze, orion, s, hand, from, christmannus, other, arabic, names, recorded, include, al, yad, al, yamn, the, right, hand, al, dhira, the, arm, and, al, mankib, the, shoulder, all, of, al, jauz, orion, as, mankib, al, jauz, other, names, for, betelgeuse, included, the, persian, ba, n, the, arm, and, coptic, klaria, an, armlet, bahu, was, its, sanskrit, name, as, part, of, a, hindu, understanding, of, the, constellation, as, a, running, antelope, or, stag, in, traditional, chinese, astronomy, the, name, for, betelgeuse, is, sh, nxi, s, the, fourth, star, of, the, constellation, of, three, stars, as, the, chinese, constellation, originally, referred, to, the, three, stars, in, orion, s, belt, this, constellation, was, ultimately, expanded, to, ten, stars, but, the, earlier, name, stuck, in, japan, the, taira, or, heike, clan, adopted, betelgeuse, and, its, red, color, as, its, symbol, calling, the, star, heike, boshi, while, the, minamoto, or, genji, clan, chose, rigel, and, its, white, color, the, two, powerful, families, fought, a, legendary, war, in, japanese, history, the, stars, seen, as, facing, each, other, off, and, only, kept, apart, by, the, belt, in, tahitian, lore, betelgeuse, was, one, of, the, pillars, propping, up, the, sky, known, as, an, varu, the, pillar, to, sit, by, it, was, also, called, ta, urua, nui, o, mere, great, festivity, in, parental, yearnings, a, hawaiian, term, for, it, was, kaulua, koko, brilliant, red, star, the, lacandon, people, of, central, america, knew, it, as, ch, k, tulix, red, butterfly, astronomy, writer, robert, burnham, jr, proposed, the, term, padparadaschah, which, denotes, a, rare, orange, sapphire, in, india, for, the, star, with, the, history, of, astronomy, intimately, associated, with, mythology, and, astrology, before, the, scientific, revolution, the, red, star, like, the, planet, mars, that, derives, its, name, from, a, roman, war, god, has, been, closely, associated, with, the, martial, archetype, of, conquest, for, millennia, and, by, extension, the, motif, of, death, and, rebirth, other, cultures, have, produced, different, myths, stephen, r, wilk, has, proposed, the, constellation, of, orion, could, have, represented, the, greek, mythological, figure, pelops, who, had, an, artificial, shoulder, of, ivory, made, for, him, with, betelgeuse, as, the, shoulder, its, color, reminiscent, of, the, reddish, yellow, sheen, of, ivory, aboriginal, people, from, the, great, victoria, desert, of, south, australia, incorporated, betelgeuse, into, their, oral, traditions, as, the, club, of, nyeeruna, orion, which, fills, with, fire, magic, and, dissipates, before, returning, this, has, been, interpreted, as, showing, that, early, aboriginal, observers, were, aware, of, the, brightness, variations, of, betelgeuse, the, wardaman, people, of, northern, australia, knew, the, star, as, ya, jungin, owl, eyes, flicking, its, variable, light, signifying, its, intermittent, watching, of, ceremonies, led, by, the, red, kangaroo, leader, rigel, in, south, african, mythology, betelgeuse, was,
