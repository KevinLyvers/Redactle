an, island, or, isle, is, a, piece, of, land, distinct, from, a, continent, completely, surrounded, by, water, there, are, continental, islands, which, were, formed, by, being, split, from, a, continent, by, plate, tectonics, and, oceanic, islands, which, have, never, been, part, of, a, continent, oceanic, islands, can, be, formed, from, volcanic, activity, grow, into, atolls, from, coral, reefs, and, form, from, sediment, along, shorelines, creating, barrier, islands, river, islands, can, also, form, from, sediment, and, debris, in, rivers, artificial, islands, are, those, made, by, humans, including, small, rocky, outcroppings, built, out, of, lagoons, and, large, scale, land, reclamation, projects, used, for, development, islands, are, host, to, diverse, plant, and, animal, life, oceanic, islands, have, the, sea, as, a, natural, barrier, to, the, introduction, of, new, species, causing, the, species, that, do, reach, the, island, to, evolve, in, isolation, continental, islands, share, animal, and, plant, life, with, the, continent, they, split, from, depending, on, how, long, ago, the, continental, island, formed, the, life, on, that, island, may, have, diverged, greatly, from, the, mainland, due, to, natural, selection, humans, have, lived, on, and, traveled, between, islands, for, thousands, of, years, at, a, minimum, some, islands, became, host, to, humans, due, to, a, land, bridge, or, a, continental, island, splitting, from, the, mainland, today, up, to, 10, of, the, world, s, population, lives, on, islands, islands, are, popular, targets, for, tourism, due, to, their, perceived, natural, beauty, isolation, and, unique, cultures, islands, became, the, target, of, colonization, by, europeans, resulting, in, the, majority, of, islands, in, the, pacific, being, put, under, european, control, decolonization, has, resulted, in, some, but, not, all, island, nations, becoming, self, governing, with, lasting, effects, related, to, industrialization, nuclear, weapons, testing, invasive, species, and, tourism, islands, and, island, countries, are, threatened, by, climate, change, sea, level, rise, threatens, to, submerge, nations, such, as, tuvalu, and, the, marshall, islands, completely, increases, in, the, frequency, and, intensity, of, tropical, cyclones, can, cause, widespread, destruction, of, infrastructure, and, animal, habitats, species, that, live, exclusively, on, islands, are, some, of, those, most, threatened, by, extinction, an, island, is, an, area, of, land, surrounded, by, water, on, all, sides, that, is, distinct, from, a, continent, there, is, no, standard, of, size, that, distinguishes, islands, and, continents, continents, have, an, accepted, geological, definition, they, are, the, largest, landmass, of, a, particular, tectonic, plate, islands, can, occur, in, any, body, of, water, including, rivers, seas, and, lakes, low, tide, elevations, areas, of, land, that, are, not, above, the, surface, during, a, high, tide, are, generally, not, considered, islands, islands, that, have, been, bridged, or, otherwise, joined, to, a, mainland, with, land, reclamation, are, sometimes, considered, de, islanded, but, not, in, every, case, the, word, island, derives, from, middle, english, iland, from, old, english, igland, from, ig, or, ieg, similarly, meaning, island, when, used, independently, and, land, carrying, its, contemporary, meaning, old, english, ieg, is, actually, a, cognate, of, swedish, and, german, aue, and, more, distantly, related, to, latin, aqua, water, the, spelling, of, the, word, was, modified, in, the, 15th, century, because, of, a, false, etymology, caused, by, an, association, with, the, old, french, loanword, isle, which, itself, comes, from, the, latin, word, insula, islands, often, are, found, in, archipelagos, or, island, chains, which, are, collections, of, islands, these, chains, are, thought, to, form, from, volcanic, hotspots, areas, of, the, lithosphere, where, the, mantle, is, hotter, than, the, surrounding, area, these, hotspots, would, give, rise, to, volcanoes, whose, lava, would, form, the, rock, the, islands, are, made, of, for, some, islands, the, movement, of, tectonic, plates, above, stationary, hotspots, would, form, islands, in, a, linear, chain, with, the, islands, further, away, from, the, hotspot, being, progressively, older, and, more, eroded, before, disappearing, under, the, sea, entirely, an, example, is, the, hawaiian, islands, with, the, oldest, island, being, 25, million, years, old, and, the, youngest, hawaii, still, being, an, active, volcano, however, not, all, island, chains, are, formed, this, way, some, may, be, formed, all, at, once, by, fractures, in, the, tectonic, plates, themselves, simultaneously, creating, multiple, islands, one, supporting, piece, of, evidence, is, that, of, the, line, islands, which, are, all, estimated, to, be, 8, million, years, old, rather, than, being, different, ages, other, island, chains, form, due, to, being, separated, from, existing, continents, the, japanese, archipelago, may, have, been, separated, from, eurasia, due, to, seafloor, spreading, a, phenomenon, where, new, oceanic, crust, is, formed, pushing, away, older, crust, islands, sitting, on, the, continental, shelf, may, be, called, continental, islands, other, islands, like, those, that, make, up, new, zealand, are, what, remains, of, continents, that, shrank, and, sunk, beneath, the, sea, it, was, estimated, that, zealandia, the, continent, like, area, of, crust, that, new, zealand, sits, on, has, had, 93, of, its, original, surface, area, submerged, some, islands, are, formed, when, coral, reefs, grow, on, volcanic, islands, that, have, submerged, beneath, the, surface, when, these, coral, islands, encircle, a, central, lagoon, the, island, is, known, as, an, atoll, the, formation, of, reefs, and, islands, related, to, those, reefs, is, aided, by, the, buildup, of, sediment, in, shallow, patches, of, water, in, some, cases, tectonic, movements, lifting, a, reef, out, of, the, water, by, as, little, as, 1, meter, can, cause, sediment, to, accumulate, and, an, island, to, form, barrier, islands, are, long, sandy, bars, that, form, along, shorelines, due, to, the, deposition, of, sediment, by, waves, these, islands, erode, and, grow, as, the, wind, and, waves, shift, barrier, islands, have, the, effect, of, protecting, coastal, areas, from, severe, weather, because, they, absorb, some, of, the, energy, of, large, waves, before, they, can, reach, the, shore, a, fluvial, island, is, an, island, that, forms, from, the, erosion, and, sedimentation, of, debris, in, rivers, almost, all, rivers, have, some, form, of, fluvial, islands, these, islands, may, only, be, a, few, meters, high, and, are, usually, temporary, changes, in, the, flow, speed, water, level, and, sediment, content, of, the, river, may, effect, the, rate, of, fluvial, island, formation, and, depletion, permanent, river, islands, also, exist, the, largest, of, which, that, is, completely, inland, is, bananal, island, in, the, tocantins, of, brazil, which, has, a, maximum, width, of, 55, kilometers, lakes, form, for, a, variety, of, reasons, including, glaciers, plate, tectonics, and, volcanism, lake, islands, can, form, as, part, of, these, processes, the, field, of, insular, biogeography, studies, the, ecological, processes, that, take, place, on, islands, with, a, focus, on, what, factors, effect, the, evolution, extinction, and, richness, of, species, scientists, often, study, islands, as, an, isolated, model, of, how, the, process, of, natural, selection, takes, place, island, ecology, studies, organisms, on, islands, and, their, environment, it, has, yielded, important, insights, for, its, parent, field, of, ecology, since, the, time, of, charles, darwin, in, biology, endemism, is, defined, as, the, phenomenon, where, species, or, genus, is, only, found, in, a, certain, geographical, area, islands, isolate, land, organisms, from, others, with, water, and, isolate, aquatic, organisms, living, on, them, with, land, island, ecosystems, have, the, highest, rates, of, endemism, globally, this, means, that, islands, contribute, heavily, to, global, biodiversity, areas, with, high, lives, of, biodiversity, are, a, priority, target, of, conservation, efforts, to, prevent, the, extinction, of, these, species, despite, high, levels, of, endemism, the, total, species, richness, the, total, number, of, unique, species, in, a, region, is, lower, on, islands, than, on, mainlands, the, level, of, species, richness, on, islands, is, proportional, to, the, area, of, that, island, a, phenomenon, known, as, the, species, area, relationship, this, is, because, larger, areas, have, more, resources, and, thus, can, support, more, organisms, populations, with, a, higher, carrying, capacity, also, have, more, genetic, diversity, which, promotes, speciation, oceanic, islands, ones, that, have, never, been, connected, to, shore, are, only, populated, by, life, that, can, cross, the, sea, this, means, that, any, animals, present, on, the, island, had, to, have, flown, there, in, the, case, of, birds, or, bats, were, carried, by, such, animals, or, were, carried, in, a, sea, current, in, what, is, known, as, a, rafting, event, this, phenomenon, is, known, as, oceanic, dispersal, tropical, storms, have, the, capacity, to, transport, species, over, great, distances, animals, like, tortoises, can, live, for, weeks, without, food, or, water, and, are, able, to, survive, floating, on, debris, in, the, sea, one, case, study, showed, that, in, 1995, fifteen, iguanas, survived, a, 300, km, journey, to, anguilla, in, the, caribbean, an, island, which, no, iguana, had, lived, on, previously, they, survived, floating, on, a, mass, of, uprooted, trees, from, a, storm, plant, species, are, thought, to, be, able, to, travel, great, distances, of, ocean, new, zealand, and, australia, share, 200, native, plant, species, despite, being, separated, by, 1500, km, continental, islands, islands, that, were, at, one, point, connected, to, a, continent, are, expected, to, share, a, common, history, of, plant, and, animal, life, up, until, the, point, that, the, island, broke, away, from, the, continent, for, example, the, presence, of, freshwater, fish, on, an, island, surrounded, by, ocean, would, indicate, that, it, once, was, attached, to, a, continent, since, these, fish, cannot, traverse, the, ocean, on, their, own, over, the, course, of, time, evolution, and, extinction, changes, the, nature, of, animal, life, on, a, continental, island, but, only, once, it, splits, from, the, mainland, an, example, is, that, of, the, southern, beech, a, tree, that, is, present, in, australia, new, zealand, parts, of, south, american, and, new, guinea, places, that, today, are, geographically, distant, a, possible, explanation, for, this, phenomena, is, that, these, landmasses, were, once, all, part, of, the, continent, gondwana, and, separated, by, tectonic, drift, however, there, are, competing, theories, that, suggest, this, species, may, have, reached, faraway, places, by, way, of, oceanic, dispersal, species, that, colonize, island, archipelagos, exhibit, a, specific, property, known, as, adaptive, radiation, in, this, process, a, species, that, arrives, on, a, group, of, islands, rapidly, becomes, more, diverse, over, time, splitting, off, into, new, species, or, subspecies, a, species, that, reaches, an, island, ecosystem, may, face, little, competition, for, resources, or, may, find, that, the, resources, that, they, found, in, their, previous, habitat, are, not, available, these, factors, together, result, in, individual, evolutionary, branches, with, different, means, of, survival, the, classical, example, of, this, is, darwin, s, finches, a, group, of, up, to, fifteen, tanager, species, that, are, endemic, to, the, gal, pagos, islands, these, birds, evolved, different, beaks, in, order, to, eat, different, kinds, of, food, available, on, the, islands, the, large, ground, finch, has, a, large, bill, used, to, crack, seeds, and, eat, fruit, the, genovesa, cactus, finch, prefers, cacti, as, a, food, source, and, has, a, beak, adapted, for, removing, pulp, and, flowers, from, cacti, the, green, warbler, finch, in, the, habit, of, true, warbler, species, consumes, spiders, and, insects, that, live, on, plants, other, examples, of, this, phenomenon, exist, worldwide, including, in, hawaii, and, madagascar, and, are, not, limited, to, island, ecosystems, species, endemic, to, islands, show, a, common, evolutionary, trajectory, foster, s, rule, also, known, as, the, island, rule, states, that, small, mammals, such, as, rodents, evolve, to, become, larger, known, as, island, gigantism, one, such, example, is, the, giant, tortoise, of, the, seychelles, though, it, is, unknown, if, it, grew, in, size, before, or, after, reaching, the, island, larger, animals, such, as, the, hippopotamus, tend, to, become, smaller, such, as, in, the, case, of, the, pygmy, hippopotamus, this, is, known, as, insular, dwarfism, in, the, case, of, smaller, animals, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, animals, on, islands, may, have, fewer, predators, and, competitors, resulting, in, selection, pressure, towards, larger, animals, larger, animals, may, exhaust, food, resources, quickly, due, to, their, size, causing, malnutrition, in, their, young, resulting, in, a, selection, pressure, for, smaller, animals, that, require, less, food, having, fewer, predators, would, mean, these, animals, did, not, need, not, be, large, to, survive, charles, darwin, formulated, the, theory, of, natural, selection, through, the, study, of, island, ecology, the, species, he, observed, on, the, gal, pagos, islands, including, tanager, birds, contributed, to, his, understanding, of, how, evolution, works, he, first, traveled, to, the, islands, as, a, naturalist, on, the, hms, beagle, in, 1835, as, part, of, a, five, year, circumnavigation, of, earth, he, wrote, that, the, different, islands, to, a, considerable, extent, are, inhabited, by, a, different, set, of, beings, through, the, study, of, the, finches, and, other, animals, he, realized, that, organisms, survive, by, changing, to, adapt, to, their, habitat, it, would, be, over, twenty, years, before, he, published, his, theories, in, on, the, origin, of, species, the, first, evidence, of, humans, colonizing, islands, probably, occurred, in, the, paleolithic, era, 100, 000, to, 200, 000, years, ago, reaching, the, indonesian, islands, of, flores, and, timor, would, have, required, crossing, distances, of, water, of, at, least, 29, km, 18, mi, some, islands, such, as, honshu, were, probably, connected, to, the, mainland, with, a, land, bridge, that, allowed, humans, to, colonize, it, before, it, became, an, island, the, first, people, to, colonize, distant, oceanic, islands, were, the, polynesians, many, of, the, previous, island, settlements, required, traveling, distances, of, less, than, 100, km, 62, mi, whereas, polynesians, may, have, traveled, 2, 000, 3, 200, km, 1, 200, 2, 000, mi, to, settle, islands, such, as, tahiti, they, would, send, navigators, to, sail, the, ocean, without, the, aid, of, navigational, instruments, to, discover, new, islands, for, settlement, between, 1100, and, 800, bc, polynesians, sailed, east, from, new, guinea, and, the, solomon, islands, and, reached, the, islands, that, make, up, the, modern, day, fiji, and, samoa, the, furthest, extent, of, this, migration, would, be, easter, island, in, the, east, and, new, zealand, in, the, south, with, new, zealand, s, first, settlements, between, 1250, and, 1300, historians, have, sought, to, understand, why, some, remote, islands, have, always, been, uninhabited, while, others, especially, in, the, pacific, ocean, have, long, been, populated, by, humans, generally, larger, islands, are, more, likely, to, be, able, to, sustain, humans, and, thus, are, more, likely, to, have, been, settled, small, islands, that, cannot, sustain, populations, on, their, own, can, still, be, habitable, if, they, are, within, a, commuting, distance, to, an, island, that, has, enough, resources, to, be, sustainable, the, presence, of, an, island, is, marked, by, seabirds, differences, in, cloud, and, weather, patterns, as, well, as, changes, in, the, direction, of, waves, it, is, also, possible, for, human, populations, to, have, gone, extinct, on, islands, evidenced, by, explorers, finding, islands, that, show, evidence, of, habitation, but, no, life, not, all, islands, were, or, are, inhabited, by, maritime, cultures, in, the, past, some, societies, were, found, to, have, lost, their, seafaring, ability, over, time, such, as, the, case, of, the, canary, islands, which, were, occupied, by, an, indigenous, people, since, the, island, s, first, discovery, in, the, first, century, until, being, conquered, by, the, spanish, empire, in, 1496, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, since, the, inhabitants, had, little, incentive, for, trade, and, had, little, to, any, contact, with, the, mainland, they, had, no, need, for, boats, the, motivation, for, island, exploration, has, been, the, subject, of, research, and, debate, some, early, historians, previously, argued, that, early, island, colonization, was, unintentional, perhaps, by, a, raft, being, swept, out, to, sea, others, compare, the, motivations, of, polynesian, and, similar, explorers, with, those, of, christopher, columbus, the, explorer, who, sailed, westward, over, the, atlantic, ocean, in, search, of, an, alternate, route, to, the, east, indies, these, historians, theorize, that, successful, explorers, were, rewarded, with, recognition, and, wealth, leading, others, to, attempt, possibly, dangerous, expeditions, to, discover, more, islands, usually, with, poor, results, about, 10, of, the, world, s, population, lives, on, islands, the, study, of, the, culture, of, islands, is, known, as, island, studies, the, interest, in, the, study, of, islands, is, due, to, their, unique, cultures, and, natural, environments, that, differ, from, mainland, cultures, this, is, for, a, few, reasons, first, the, obvious, political, and, geographic, isolation, from, mainland, cultures, second, unique, restraints, on, resources, and, ecology, creating, marine, focused, cultures, with, a, focus, on, fishing, and, sailing, third, a, lasting, historical, and, political, significance, of, islands, the, polynesian, diet, got, most, of, its, protein, from, fishing, polynesians, were, known, to, fish, close, to, shore, as, well, as, in, deep, water, it, was, reported, that, rapa, nui, people, were, known, to, fish, as, far, as, 500, km, 310, mi, from, shore, at, coral, reefs, spear, line, and, net, fishing, were, all, used, to, catch, tuna, as, well, as, sharks, and, stingrays, island, cultures, also, cultivate, native, and, non, native, crops, polynesians, grew, the, native, yam, taro, breadfruit, banana, coconut, and, other, fruits, and, vegetables, different, island, climates, made, different, resources, more, important, such, as, the, hawaiian, islands, being, home, to, irrigated, fields, of, taro, whereas, in, some, islands, like, tahiti, breadfruit, was, more, widely, cultivated, and, fermented, in, order, to, preserve, it, there, is, archeological, evidence, that, canary, islanders, would, chew, the, roots, of, ferns, for, sustenance, a, practice, that, wore, heavily, on, their, molars, these, islanders, would, also, grow, barley, and, raised, livestock, such, as, goats, many, island, nations, have, little, land, and, a, restricted, set, of, natural, resources, however, these, nations, control, some, of, the, largest, fisheries, in, the, world, deposits, of, copper, gold, and, nickel, as, well, as, oil, deposits, the, natural, beauty, of, island, nations, also, makes, them, a, magnet, for, tourism, islands, also, have, geopolitical, value, for, naval, bases, weapons, testing, and, general, territorial, control, one, such, example, is, french, polynesia, a, territory, that, receives, substantial, military, expenditure, and, aid, from, france, since, the, first, discoveries, of, polynesian, micronesian, and, other, islands, by, westerners, these, nations, have, been, the, subject, of, colonization, islands, were, the, target, of, christian, missionaries, these, missionaries, faced, resistance, but, found, success, when, some, local, chiefs, used, european, support, to, centralize, power, beginning, in, the, 16th, century, european, states, placed, most, of, oceania, in, under, colonial, administration, pohnpei, was, colonized, by, spain, as, early, as, 1526, it, changed, hands, from, germany, to, japan, to, the, united, states, before, joining, the, federated, states, of, micronesia, in, 1982, maintaining, a, free, association, status, with, the, u, s, guam, was, a, spanish, territory, until, 1898, and, now, is, a, unincorporated, territory, of, the, u, s, the, decolonization, era, saw, many, island, states, achieve, independence, or, some, form, of, self, governance, nuclear, weapons, testing, on, the, marshall, islands, left, many, atolls, destroyed, or, uninhabitable, causing, the, forced, displacement, of, people, from, their, home, islands, as, well, as, increases, in, cancer, rates, due, to, radiation, colonization, has, resulted, in, a, decline, of, observance, of, traditional, cultural, practices, in, places, such, as, hawaii, where, native, hawaiians, are, now, a, minority, cultural, attitudes, related, to, communal, ownership, of, land, as, well, as, a, lack, of, individualistic, decision, making, may, make, some, island, cultures, less, compatible, with, the, global, capitalist, economy, causing, these, nations, to, experience, less, economic, growth, islands, have, long, been, a, popular, target, for, tourism, thanks, to, their, unique, climates, cultures, and, natural, beauty, however, islands, may, suffer, from, poor, transportation, connectivity, from, airplanes, and, boats, and, strains, on, infrastructure, from, tourist, activity, islands, in, colder, climates, often, rely, on, seasonal, tourists, seeking, to, enjoy, nature, or, local, cultures, and, may, only, be, one, aspect, of, an, island, s, economy, in, contrast, tourism, on, tropical, islands, can, often, make, up, the, majority, of, the, local, economy, and, built, environment, these, islands, sometimes, also, require, consistent, foreign, aid, on, top, of, tourism, in, order, to, ensure, economic, growth, this, reliance, can, result, in, social, inequality, and, environmental, degradation, during, tourism, downturns, these, economies, struggle, to, make, up, the, lost, inflow, of, cash, with, other, industries, climate, change, threatens, human, development, on, islands, due, to, sea, level, rise, more, dangerous, tropical, cyclones, coral, bleaching, and, an, increase, in, invasive, species, for, example, in, 2017, hurricane, maria, caused, a, loss, of, almost, all, the, infrastructure, in, dominica, sea, level, rise, and, other, climate, changes, can, reduce, freshwater, reserves, resulting, in, droughts, these, risks, are, expected, to, decrease, the, habitability, of, islands, especially, small, ones, beyond, risks, to, human, life, plant, and, animal, life, are, threatened, it, has, been, estimated, that, almost, 50, percent, of, land, species, threatened, by, extinction, live, on, islands, in, 2017, a, detailed, review, of, 1, 288, islands, found, that, they, were, home, to, 1, 189, highly, threatened, vertebrate, species, which, was, 41, percent, of, the, global, figure, coral, bleaching, is, expected, to, occur, with, more, frequency, threatening, marine, ecosystems, some, of, which, island, economies, are, dependent, on, some, islands, that, are, low, lying, may, cease, to, exist, given, high, enough, amounts, of, sea, level, rise, tuvalu, received, media, attention, for, a, press, conference, publicizing, the, ongoing, submerging, of, the, island, country, tuvalu, signed, a, cooperation, agreement, with, australia, agreeing, to, annually, allow, 280, of, its, citizens, to, become, permanent, residents, of, australia, the, marshall, islands, a, country, of, 1, 156, islands, have, also, been, identified, as, a, country, that, may, be, existentially, threatened, by, rising, seas, increasing, intensity, of, tropical, storms, also, increases, the, distances, and, frequency, with, which, invasive, species, may, be, transported, to, islands, floodwaters, from, these, storms, may, also, wash, plants, further, inland, than, they, would, travel, on, their, own, introducing, them, to, new, habitats, agriculture, and, trade, also, have, introduced, non, native, life, to, islands, these, processes, result, in, an, introduction, of, invasive, species, to, ecosystems, that, are, especially, small, and, fragile, one, example, is, the, apple, snail, initially, introduced, to, the, u, s, by, aquarium, owners, it, has, since, been, transported, by, hurricanes, across, the, gulf, coast, and, neighboring, islands, these, species, compete, for, resources, with, native, animals, and, some, may, grow, so, densely, that, they, displace, other, forms, of, existing, life, for, hundreds, of, years, islands, have, been, created, through, land, reclamation, one, of, the, first, recorded, instances, of, this, when, people, of, the, solomon, islands, created, eighty, such, islands, by, piling, coral, and, rock, in, the, lau, lagoon, one, traditional, way, of, constructing, islands, is, with, the, use, of, a, revetment, sandbags, or, stones, are, dropped, with, a, barge, into, the, sea, to, bring, the, land, level, slightly, out, of, the, water, the, island, area, is, then, filled, with, sand, or, gravel, followed, by, a, construction, of, this, revetment, to, hold, it, together, islands, have, also, been, constructed, with, a, permanent, caisson, a, steel, or, concrete, structure, built, in, a, closed, loop, and, then, filled, with, sand, some, modern, islands, have, been, constructed, by, pouring, millions, of, tons, of, sand, into, the, sea, such, as, with, pearl, island, in, qatar, or, the, palm, islands, in, dubai, these, islands, are, usually, created,
