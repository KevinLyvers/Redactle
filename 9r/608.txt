breccia, b, r, t, i, b, r, is, a, rock, composed, of, large, angular, broken, fragments, of, minerals, or, rocks, cemented, together, by, a, fine, grained, matrix, the, word, has, its, origins, in, the, italian, language, in, which, it, means, rubble, a, breccia, may, have, a, variety, of, different, origins, as, indicated, by, the, named, types, including, sedimentary, breccia, fault, or, tectonic, breccia, igneous, breccia, impact, breccia, and, hydrothermal, breccia, a, megabreccia, is, a, breccia, composed, of, very, large, rock, fragments, sometimes, kilometers, across, which, can, be, formed, by, landslides, impact, events, or, caldera, collapse, breccia, is, composed, of, coarse, rock, fragments, held, together, by, cement, or, a, fine, grained, matrix, like, conglomerate, breccia, contains, at, least, 30, percent, of, gravel, sized, particles, particles, over, 2mm, in, size, but, it, is, distinguished, from, conglomerate, because, the, rock, fragments, have, sharp, edges, that, have, not, been, worn, down, these, indicate, that, the, gravel, was, deposited, very, close, to, its, source, area, since, otherwise, the, edges, would, have, been, rounded, during, transport, most, of, the, rounding, of, rock, fragments, takes, place, within, the, first, few, kilometers, of, transport, though, complete, rounding, of, pebbles, of, very, hard, rock, may, take, up, to, 300, kilometers, 190, mi, of, river, transport, a, megabreccia, is, a, breccia, containing, very, large, rock, fragments, from, at, least, a, meter, in, size, to, greater, than, 400, meters, in, some, cases, the, clasts, are, so, large, that, the, brecciated, nature, of, the, rock, is, not, obvious, megabreccias, can, be, formed, by, landslides, impact, events, or, caldera, collapse, breccias, are, further, classified, by, their, mechanism, of, formation, sedimentary, breccia, is, breccia, formed, by, sedimentary, processes, for, example, scree, deposited, at, the, base, of, a, cliff, may, become, cemented, to, form, a, talus, breccia, without, ever, experiencing, transport, that, might, round, the, rock, fragments, thick, sequences, of, sedimentary, colluvial, breccia, are, generally, formed, next, to, fault, scarps, in, grabens, sedimentary, breccia, may, be, formed, by, submarine, debris, flows, turbidites, occur, as, fine, grained, peripheral, deposits, to, sedimentary, breccia, flows, in, a, karst, terrain, a, collapse, breccia, may, form, due, to, collapse, of, rock, into, a, sinkhole, or, in, cave, development, collapse, breccias, also, form, by, dissolution, of, underlying, evaporite, beds, fault, or, tectonic, breccia, results, from, the, grinding, action, of, two, fault, blocks, as, they, slide, past, each, other, subsequent, cementation, of, these, broken, fragments, may, occur, by, means, of, the, introduction, of, mineral, matter, in, groundwater, igneous, clastic, rocks, can, be, divided, into, two, classes, volcanic, pyroclastic, rocks, are, formed, by, explosive, eruption, of, lava, and, any, rocks, which, are, entrained, within, the, eruptive, column, this, may, include, rocks, plucked, off, the, wall, of, the, magma, conduit, or, physically, picked, up, by, the, ensuing, pyroclastic, surge, lavas, especially, rhyolite, and, dacite, flows, tend, to, form, clastic, volcanic, rocks, by, a, process, known, as, autobrecciation, this, occurs, when, the, thick, nearly, solid, lava, breaks, up, into, blocks, and, these, blocks, are, then, reincorporated, into, the, lava, flow, again, and, mixed, in, with, the, remaining, liquid, magma, the, resulting, breccia, is, uniform, in, rock, type, and, chemical, composition, caldera, collapse, leads, to, the, formation, of, megabreccias, which, are, sometimes, mistaken, for, outcrops, of, the, caldera, floor, these, are, instead, blocks, of, precaldera, rock, often, coming, from, the, unstable, oversteepened, rim, of, the, caldera, they, are, distinguished, from, mesobreccias, whose, clasts, are, less, than, a, meter, in, size, and, which, form, layers, in, the, caldera, floor, some, clasts, of, caldera, megabreccias, can, be, over, a, kilometer, in, length, within, the, volcanic, conduits, of, explosive, volcanoes, the, volcanic, breccia, environment, merges, into, the, intrusive, breccia, environment, there, the, upwelling, lava, tends, to, solidify, during, quiescent, intervals, only, to, be, shattered, by, ensuing, eruptions, this, produces, an, alloclastic, volcanic, breccia, clastic, rocks, are, also, commonly, found, in, shallow, subvolcanic, intrusions, such, as, porphyry, stocks, granites, and, kimberlite, pipes, where, they, are, transitional, with, volcanic, breccias, intrusive, rocks, can, become, brecciated, in, appearance, by, multiple, stages, of, intrusion, especially, if, fresh, magma, is, intruded, into, partly, consolidated, or, solidified, magma, this, may, be, seen, in, many, granite, intrusions, where, later, aplite, veins, form, a, late, stage, stockwork, through, earlier, phases, of, the, granite, mass, when, particularly, intense, the, rock, may, appear, as, a, chaotic, breccia, clastic, rocks, in, mafic, and, ultramafic, intrusions, have, been, found, and, form, via, several, processes, impact, breccias, are, thought, to, be, diagnostic, of, an, impact, event, such, as, an, asteroid, or, comet, striking, the, earth, and, are, normally, found, at, impact, craters, impact, breccia, a, type, of, impactite, forms, during, the, process, of, impact, cratering, when, large, meteorites, or, comets, impact, with, the, earth, or, other, rocky, planets, or, asteroids, breccia, of, this, type, may, be, present, on, or, beneath, the, floor, of, the, crater, in, the, rim, or, in, the, ejecta, expelled, beyond, the, crater, impact, breccia, may, be, identified, by, its, occurrence, in, or, around, a, known, impact, crater, and, or, an, association, with, other, products, of, impact, cratering, such, as, shatter, cones, impact, glass, shocked, minerals, and, chemical, and, isotopic, evidence, of, contamination, with, extraterrestrial, material, e, g, iridium, and, osmium, anomalies, an, example, of, an, impact, breccia, is, the, neugrund, breccia, which, was, formed, in, the, neugrund, impact, hydrothermal, breccias, usually, form, at, shallow, crustal, levels, 1, km, between, 150, and, 350, c, when, seismic, or, volcanic, activity, causes, a, void, to, open, along, a, fault, deep, underground, the, void, draws, in, hot, water, and, as, pressure, in, the, cavity, drops, the, water, violently, boils, in, addition, the, sudden, opening, of, a, cavity, causes, rock, at, the, sides, of, the, fault, to, destabilise, and, implode, inwards, and, the, broken, rock, gets, caught, up, in, a, churning, mixture, of, rock, steam, and, boiling, water, rock, fragments, collide, with, each, other, and, the, sides, of, the, void, and, the, angular, fragments, become, more, rounded, volatile, gases, are, lost, to, the, steam, phase, as, boiling, continues, in, particular, carbon, dioxide, as, a, result, the, chemistry, of, the, fluids, changes, and, ore, minerals, rapidly, precipitate, breccia, hosted, ore, deposits, are, quite, common, the, morphology, of, breccias, associated, with, ore, deposits, varies, from, tabular, sheeted, veins, and, clastic, dikes, associated, with, overpressured, sedimentary, strata, to, large, scale, intrusive, diatreme, breccias, breccia, pipes, or, even, some, synsedimentary, diatremes, formed, solely, by, the, overpressure, of, pore, fluid, within, sedimentary, basins, hydrothermal, breccias, are, usually, formed, by, hydrofracturing, of, rocks, by, highly, pressured, hydrothermal, fluids, they, are, typical, of, the, epithermal, ore, environment, and, are, intimately, associated, with, intrusive, related, ore, deposits, such, as, skarns, greisens, and, porphyry, related, mineralisation, epithermal, deposits, are, mined, for, copper, silver, and, gold, in, the, mesothermal, regime, at, much, greater, depths, fluids, under, lithostatic, pressure, can, be, released, during, seismic, activity, associated, with, mountain, building, the, pressurised, fluids, ascend, towards, shallower, crustal, levels, that, are, under, lower, hydrostatic, pressure, on, their, journey, high, pressure, fluids, crack, rock, by, hydrofracturing, forming, an, angular, in, situ, breccia, rounding, of, rock, fragments, is, less, common, in, the, mesothermal, regime, as, the, formational, event, is, brief, if, boiling, occurs, methane, and, hydrogen, sulfide, may, be, lost, to, the, steam, phase, and, ore, may, precipitate, mesothermal, deposits, are, often, mined, for, gold, for, thousands, of, years, the, striking, visual, appearance, of, breccias, has, made, them, a, popular, sculptural, and, architectural, material, breccia, was, used, for, column, bases, in, the, minoan, palace, of, knossos, on, crete, in, about, 1800, bc, breccia, was, used, on, a, limited, scale, by, the, ancient, egyptians, one, of, the, best, known, examples, is, the, statue, of, the, goddess, tawaret, in, the, british, museum, breccia, was, regarded, by, the, romans, as, an, especially, precious, stone, and, was, often, used, in, high, profile, public, buildings, many, types, of, marble, are, brecciated, such, as, breccia, oniciata
