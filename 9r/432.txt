francium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, fr, and, atomic, number, 87, it, is, extremely, radioactive, its, most, stable, isotope, francium, 223, originally, called, actinium, k, after, the, natural, decay, chain, in, which, it, appears, has, a, half, life, of, only, 22, minutes, it, is, the, second, most, electropositive, element, behind, only, caesium, and, is, the, second, rarest, naturally, occurring, element, after, astatine, francium, s, isotopes, decay, quickly, into, astatine, radium, and, radon, the, electronic, structure, of, a, francium, atom, is, 7s, 1, thus, the, element, is, classed, as, an, alkali, metal, bulk, francium, has, never, been, seen, because, of, the, general, appearance, of, the, other, elements, in, its, periodic, table, column, it, is, presumed, that, francium, would, appear, as, a, highly, reactive, metal, if, enough, could, be, collected, together, to, be, viewed, as, a, bulk, solid, or, liquid, obtaining, such, a, sample, is, highly, improbable, since, the, extreme, heat, of, decay, resulting, from, its, short, half, life, would, immediately, vaporize, any, viewable, quantity, of, the, element, francium, was, discovered, by, marguerite, perey, in, france, from, which, the, element, takes, its, name, on, january, 7, 1939, before, its, discovery, francium, was, referred, to, as, eka, caesium, or, ekacaesium, because, of, its, conjectured, existence, below, caesium, in, the, periodic, table, it, was, the, last, element, first, discovered, in, nature, rather, than, by, synthesis, outside, the, laboratory, francium, is, extremely, rare, with, trace, amounts, found, in, uranium, ores, where, the, isotope, francium, 223, in, the, family, of, uranium, 235, continually, forms, and, decays, as, little, as, 1, ounce, 28, g, exists, at, any, given, time, throughout, the, earth, s, crust, aside, from, francium, 223, and, francium, 221, its, other, isotopes, are, entirely, synthetic, the, largest, amount, produced, in, the, laboratory, was, a, cluster, of, more, than, 300, 000, atoms, francium, is, one, of, the, most, unstable, of, the, naturally, occurring, elements, its, longest, lived, isotope, francium, 223, has, a, half, life, of, only, 22, minutes, the, only, comparable, element, is, astatine, whose, most, stable, natural, isotope, astatine, 219, the, alpha, daughter, of, francium, 223, has, a, half, life, of, 56, seconds, although, synthetic, astatine, 210, is, much, longer, lived, with, a, half, life, of, 8, 1, hours, all, isotopes, of, francium, decay, into, astatine, radium, or, radon, francium, 223, also, has, a, shorter, half, life, than, the, longest, lived, isotope, of, each, synthetic, element, up, to, and, including, element, 105, dubnium, francium, is, an, alkali, metal, whose, chemical, properties, mostly, resemble, those, of, caesium, a, heavy, element, with, a, single, valence, electron, it, has, the, highest, equivalent, weight, of, any, element, liquid, francium, if, created, should, have, a, surface, tension, of, 0, 05092, n, m, at, its, melting, point, francium, s, melting, point, was, estimated, to, be, around, 8, 0, c, 46, 4, f, a, value, of, 27, c, 81, f, is, also, often, encountered, the, melting, point, is, uncertain, because, of, the, element, s, extreme, rarity, and, radioactivity, a, different, extrapolation, based, on, dmitri, mendeleev, s, method, gave, 20, 1, 5, c, 68, 0, 2, 7, f, a, calculation, based, on, the, melting, temperatures, of, binary, ionic, crystals, gives, 24, 861, 0, 517, c, 76, 750, 0, 931, f, the, estimated, boiling, point, of, 620, c, 1, 148, f, is, also, uncertain, the, estimates, 598, c, 1, 108, f, and, 677, c, 1, 251, f, as, well, as, the, extrapolation, from, mendeleev, s, method, of, 640, c, 1, 184, f, have, also, been, suggested, the, density, of, francium, is, expected, to, be, around, 2, 48, g, cm, 3, mendeleev, s, method, extrapolates, 2, 4, g, cm, 3, linus, pauling, estimated, the, electronegativity, of, francium, at, 0, 7, on, the, pauling, scale, the, same, as, caesium, the, value, for, caesium, has, since, been, refined, to, 0, 79, but, there, are, no, experimental, data, to, allow, a, refinement, of, the, value, for, francium, francium, has, a, slightly, higher, ionization, energy, than, caesium, 392, 811, 4, kj, mol, as, opposed, to, 375, 7041, 2, kj, mol, for, caesium, as, would, be, expected, from, relativistic, effects, and, this, would, imply, that, caesium, is, the, less, electronegative, of, the, two, francium, should, also, have, a, higher, electron, affinity, than, caesium, and, the, fr, ion, should, be, more, polarizable, than, the, cs, ion, as, a, result, of, francium, s, instability, its, salts, are, only, known, to, a, small, extent, francium, coprecipitates, with, several, caesium, salts, such, as, caesium, perchlorate, which, results, in, small, amounts, of, francium, perchlorate, this, coprecipitation, can, be, used, to, isolate, francium, by, adapting, the, radiocaesium, coprecipitation, method, of, lawrence, e, glendenin, and, c, m, nelson, it, will, additionally, coprecipitate, with, many, other, caesium, salts, including, the, iodate, the, picrate, the, tartrate, also, rubidium, tartrate, the, chloroplatinate, and, the, silicotungstate, it, also, coprecipitates, with, silicotungstic, acid, and, with, perchloric, acid, without, another, alkali, metal, as, a, carrier, which, leads, to, other, methods, of, separation, francium, perchlorate, is, produced, by, the, reaction, of, francium, chloride, and, sodium, perchlorate, the, francium, perchlorate, coprecipitates, with, caesium, perchlorate, this, coprecipitation, can, be, used, to, isolate, francium, by, adapting, the, radiocaesium, coprecipitation, method, of, lawrence, e, glendenin, and, c, m, nelson, however, this, method, is, unreliable, in, separating, thallium, which, also, coprecipitates, with, caesium, francium, perchlorate, s, entropy, is, expected, to, be, 42, 7, e, u, 178, 7, j, mol, 1, k, 1, francium, halides, are, all, soluble, in, water, and, are, expected, to, be, white, solids, they, are, expected, to, be, produced, by, the, reaction, of, the, corresponding, halogens, for, example, francium, chloride, would, be, produced, by, the, reaction, of, francium, and, chlorine, francium, chloride, has, been, studied, as, a, pathway, to, separate, francium, from, other, elements, by, using, the, high, vapour, pressure, of, the, compound, although, francium, fluoride, would, have, a, higher, vapour, pressure, francium, nitrate, sulfate, hydroxide, carbonate, acetate, and, oxalate, are, all, soluble, in, water, while, the, iodate, picrate, tartrate, chloroplatinate, and, silicotungstate, are, insoluble, the, insolubility, of, these, compounds, are, used, to, extract, francium, from, other, radioactive, products, such, as, zirconium, niobium, molybdenum, tin, antimony, the, method, mentioned, in, the, section, above, francium, oxide, is, believed, to, disproportionate, to, the, peroxide, and, francium, metal, the, csfr, molecule, is, predicted, to, have, francium, at, the, negative, end, of, the, dipole, unlike, all, known, heterodiatomic, alkali, metal, molecules, francium, superoxide, fro, 2, is, expected, to, have, a, more, covalent, character, than, its, lighter, congeners, this, is, attributed, to, the, 6p, electrons, in, francium, being, more, involved, in, the, francium, oxygen, bonding, the, relativistic, destabilisation, of, the, 6p, 3, 2, spinor, may, make, francium, compounds, in, oxidation, states, higher, than, 1, possible, such, as, but, this, has, not, been, experimentally, confirmed, there, are, 37, known, isotopes, of, francium, ranging, in, atomic, mass, from, 197, to, 233, francium, has, seven, metastable, nuclear, isomers, francium, 223, and, francium, 221, are, the, only, isotopes, that, occur, in, nature, with, the, former, being, far, more, common, francium, 223, is, the, most, stable, isotope, with, a, half, life, of, 21, 8, minutes, and, it, is, highly, unlikely, that, an, isotope, of, francium, with, a, longer, half, life, will, ever, be, discovered, or, synthesized, francium, 223, is, a, fifth, product, of, the, uranium, 235, decay, series, as, a, daughter, isotope, of, actinium, 227, thorium, 227, is, the, more, common, daughter, francium, 223, then, decays, into, radium, 223, by, beta, decay, 1, 149, mev, decay, energy, with, a, minor, 0, 006, alpha, decay, path, to, astatine, 219, 5, 4, mev, decay, energy, francium, 221, has, a, half, life, of, 4, 8, minutes, it, is, the, ninth, product, of, the, neptunium, decay, series, as, a, daughter, isotope, of, actinium, 225, francium, 221, then, decays, into, astatine, 217, by, alpha, decay, 6, 457, mev, decay, energy, although, all, primordial, 237, np, is, extinct, the, neptunium, decay, series, continues, to, exist, naturally, in, tiny, traces, due, to, n, 2n, knockout, reactions, in, natural, 238, u, francium, 222, with, a, half, life, of, 14, minutes, may, be, produced, as, a, result, of, the, beta, decay, of, natural, radon, 222, this, process, though, energetically, possible, has, nonetheless, not, yet, been, observed, the, least, stable, ground, state, isotope, is, francium, 215, with, a, half, life, of, 90, ns, it, undergoes, a, 9, 54, mev, alpha, decay, to, astatine, 211, due, to, its, instability, and, rarity, there, are, no, commercial, applications, for, francium, it, has, been, used, for, research, purposes, in, the, fields, of, chemistry, and, of, atomic, structure, its, use, as, a, potential, diagnostic, aid, for, various, cancers, has, also, been, explored, but, this, application, has, been, deemed, impractical, francium, s, ability, to, be, synthesized, trapped, and, cooled, along, with, its, relatively, simple, atomic, structure, has, made, it, the, subject, of, specialized, spectroscopy, experiments, these, experiments, have, led, to, more, specific, information, regarding, energy, levels, and, the, coupling, constants, between, subatomic, particles, studies, on, the, light, emitted, by, laser, trapped, francium, 210, ions, have, provided, accurate, data, on, transitions, between, atomic, energy, levels, which, are, fairly, similar, to, those, predicted, by, quantum, theory, as, early, as, 1870, chemists, thought, that, there, should, be, an, alkali, metal, beyond, caesium, with, an, atomic, number, of, 87, it, was, then, referred, to, by, the, provisional, name, eka, caesium, in, 1914, stefan, meyer, viktor, f, hess, and, friedrich, paneth, working, in, vienna, made, measurements, of, alpha, radiation, from, various, substances, including, 227, ac, they, observed, the, possibility, of, a, minor, alpha, branch, of, this, nuclide, though, follow, up, work, could, not, be, done, due, to, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, their, observations, were, not, precise, and, sure, enough, for, them, to, announce, the, discovery, of, element, 87, though, it, is, likely, that, they, did, indeed, observe, the, decay, of, 227, ac, to, 223, fr, soviet, chemist, dmitry, dobroserdov, was, the, first, scientist, to, claim, to, have, found, eka, caesium, or, francium, in, 1925, he, observed, weak, radioactivity, in, a, sample, of, potassium, another, alkali, metal, and, incorrectly, concluded, that, eka, caesium, was, contaminating, the, sample, the, radioactivity, from, the, sample, was, from, the, naturally, occurring, potassium, radioisotope, potassium, 40, he, then, published, a, thesis, on, his, predictions, of, the, properties, of, eka, caesium, in, which, he, named, the, element, russium, after, his, home, country, shortly, thereafter, dobroserdov, began, to, focus, on, his, teaching, career, at, the, polytechnic, institute, of, odesa, and, he, did, not, pursue, the, element, further, the, following, year, english, chemists, gerald, j, f, druce, and, frederick, h, loring, analyzed, x, ray, photographs, of, manganese, ii, sulfate, they, observed, spectral, lines, which, they, presumed, to, be, of, eka, caesium, they, announced, their, discovery, of, element, 87, and, proposed, the, name, alkalinium, as, it, would, be, the, heaviest, alkali, metal, in, 1930, fred, allison, of, the, alabama, polytechnic, institute, claimed, to, have, discovered, element, 87, in, addition, to, 85, when, analyzing, pollucite, and, lepidolite, using, his, magneto, optical, machine, allison, requested, that, it, be, named, virginium, after, his, home, state, of, virginia, along, with, the, symbols, vi, and, vm, in, 1934, h, g, macpherson, of, uc, berkeley, disproved, the, effectiveness, of, allison, s, device, and, the, validity, of, his, discovery, in, 1936, romanian, physicist, horia, hulubei, and, his, french, colleague, yvette, cauchois, also, analyzed, pollucite, this, time, using, their, high, resolution, x, ray, apparatus, they, observed, several, weak, emission, lines, which, they, presumed, to, be, those, of, element, 87, hulubei, and, cauchois, reported, their, discovery, and, proposed, the, name, moldavium, along, with, the, symbol, ml, after, moldavia, the, romanian, province, where, hulubei, was, born, in, 1937, hulubei, s, work, was, criticized, by, american, physicist, f, h, hirsh, jr, who, rejected, hulubei, s, research, methods, hirsh, was, certain, that, eka, caesium, would, not, be, found, in, nature, and, that, hulubei, had, instead, observed, mercury, or, bismuth, x, ray, lines, hulubei, insisted, that, his, x, ray, apparatus, and, methods, were, too, accurate, to, make, such, a, mistake, because, of, this, jean, baptiste, perrin, nobel, prize, winner, and, hulubei, s, mentor, endorsed, moldavium, as, the, true, eka, caesium, over, marguerite, perey, s, recently, discovered, francium, perey, took, pains, to, be, accurate, and, detailed, in, her, criticism, of, hulubei, s, work, and, finally, she, was, credited, as, the, sole, discoverer, of, element, 87, all, other, previous, purported, discoveries, of, element, 87, were, ruled, out, due, to, francium, s, very, limited, half, life, eka, caesium, was, discovered, on, january, 7, 1939, by, marguerite, perey, of, the, curie, institute, in, paris, when, she, purified, a, sample, of, actinium, 227, which, had, been, reported, to, have, a, decay, energy, of, 220, kev, perey, noticed, decay, particles, with, an, energy, level, below, 80, kev, perey, thought, this, decay, activity, might, have, been, caused, by, a, previously, unidentified, decay, product, one, which, was, separated, during, purification, but, emerged, again, out, of, the, pure, actinium, 227, various, tests, eliminated, the, possibility, of, the, unknown, element, being, thorium, radium, lead, bismuth, or, thallium, the, new, product, exhibited, chemical, properties, of, an, alkali, metal, such, as, coprecipitating, with, caesium, salts, which, led, perey, to, believe, that, it, was, element, 87, produced, by, the, alpha, decay, of, actinium, 227, perey, then, attempted, to, determine, the, proportion, of, beta, decay, to, alpha, decay, in, actinium, 227, her, first, test, put, the, alpha, branching, at, 0, 6, a, figure, which, she, later, revised, to, 1, perey, named, the, new, isotope, actinium, k, it, is, now, referred, to, as, francium, 223, and, in, 1946, she, proposed, the, name, catium, cm, for, her, newly, discovered, element, as, she, believed, it, to, be, the, most, electropositive, cation, of, the, elements, ir, ne, joliot, curie, one, of, perey, s, supervisors, opposed, the, name, due, to, its, connotation, of, cat, rather, than, cation, furthermore, the, symbol, coincided, with, that, which, had, since, been, assigned, to, curium, perey, then, suggested, francium, after, france, this, name, was, officially, adopted, by, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, iupac, in, 1949, becoming, the, second, element, after, gallium, to, be, named, after, france, it, was, assigned, the, symbol, fa, but, it, was, revised, to, the, current, fr, shortly, thereafter, francium, was, the, last, element, discovered, in, nature, rather, than, synthesized, following, hafnium, and, rhenium, further, research, into, francium, s, structure, was, carried, out, by, among, others, sylvain, lieberman, and, his, team, at, cern, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, 223, fr, is, the, result, of, the, alpha, decay, of, 227, ac, and, can, be, found, in, trace, amounts, in, uranium, minerals, in, a, given, sample, of, uranium, there, is, estimated, to, be, only, one, francium, atom, for, every, 1, 10, 18, uranium, atoms, only, about, 1, ounce, 28, g, of, francium, is, present, naturally, in, the, earth, s, crust, francium, can, be, synthesized, by, a, fusion, reaction, when, a, gold, 197, target, is, bombarded, with, a, beam, of, oxygen, 18, atoms, from, a, linear, accelerator, in, a, process, originally, developed, at, the, physics, department, of, the, state, university, of, new, york, at, stony, brook, in, 1995, depending, on, the, energy, of, the, oxygen, beam, the, reaction, can, yield, francium, isotopes, with, masses, of, 209, 210, and, 211, the, francium, atoms, leave, the, gold, target, as, ions, which, are, neutralized, by, collision, with, yttrium, and, then, isolated, in, a, magneto, optical, trap, mot, in, a, gaseous, unconsolidated, state, although, the, atoms, only, remain, in, the, trap, for, about, 30, seconds, before, escaping, or, undergoing, nuclear, decay, the, process, supplies, a, continual, stream, of, fresh, atoms, the, result, is, a, steady, state, containing, a, fairly, constant, number, of, atoms, for, a, much, longer, time, the, original, apparatus, could, trap, up, to, a, few, thousand, atoms, while, a, later, improved, design, could, trap, over, 300, 000, at, a, time, sensitive, measurements, of, the, light, emitted, and, absorbed, by, the, trapped, atoms, provided, the, first, experimental, results, on, various, transitions, between, atomic, energy, levels, in, francium, initial, measurements, show, very, good, agreement, between, experimental, values, and, calculations, based, on, quantum, theory, the, research, project, using, this, production, method, relocated, to, triumf, in, 2012, where, over, 10, 6, francium, atoms, have, been, held, at, a, time, including, large, amounts, of, 209, fr, in, addition, to, 207, fr, and, 221, fr, other, synthesis, methods, include, bombarding, radium, with, neutrons, and, bombarding, thorium, with, protons, deuterons, or, helium, ions, 223, fr, can, also, be, isolated, from, samples, of, its, parent, 227, ac, the, francium, being, milked, via, elution, with, nh, 4, cl, cro, 3, from, an, actinium, containing, cation, exchanger, and, purified, by, passing, the, solution, through, a, silicon, dioxide, compound, loaded, with, barium, sulfate, in, 1996, the, stony, brook, group, trapped, 3000, atoms, in, their, mot, which, was, enough, for, a, video, camera, to, capture, the, light, given, off, by, the, atoms, as, they, fluoresce, francium, has, not, been, synthesized, in, amounts, large, enough, to, weigh
