benzene, is, an, organic, chemical, compound, with, the, molecular, formula, c, 6, h, 6, the, benzene, molecule, is, composed, of, six, carbon, atoms, joined, in, a, planar, hexagonal, ring, with, one, hydrogen, atom, attached, to, each, because, it, contains, only, carbon, and, hydrogen, atoms, benzene, is, classed, as, a, hydrocarbon, benzene, is, a, natural, constituent, of, petroleum, and, is, one, of, the, elementary, petrochemicals, due, to, the, cyclic, continuous, pi, bonds, between, the, carbon, atoms, benzene, is, classed, as, an, aromatic, hydrocarbon, benzene, is, a, colorless, and, highly, flammable, liquid, with, a, sweet, smell, and, is, partially, responsible, for, the, aroma, of, gasoline, it, is, used, primarily, as, a, precursor, to, the, manufacture, of, chemicals, with, more, complex, structures, such, as, ethylbenzene, and, cumene, of, which, billions, of, kilograms, are, produced, annually, although, benzene, is, a, major, industrial, chemical, it, finds, limited, use, in, consumer, items, because, of, its, toxicity, benzene, is, a, volatile, organic, compound, benzene, is, classified, as, a, carcinogen, its, particular, effects, on, human, health, such, as, the, long, term, results, of, accidental, exposure, have, been, reported, on, by, news, organizations, such, as, the, new, york, times, for, instance, a, 2022, article, stated, that, benzene, contamination, in, the, boston, metropolitan, area, caused, hazardous, conditions, in, multiple, places, with, the, publication, noting, that, the, compound, may, eventually, cause, leukemia, in, some, individuals, the, word, benzene, derives, from, gum, benzoin, benzoin, resin, an, aromatic, resin, known, since, ancient, times, in, southeast, asia, and, later, to, european, pharmacists, and, perfumers, in, the, 16th, century, via, trade, routes, an, acidic, material, was, derived, from, benzoin, by, sublimation, and, named, flowers, of, benzoin, or, benzoic, acid, the, hydrocarbon, derived, from, benzoic, acid, thus, acquired, the, name, benzin, benzol, or, benzene, michael, faraday, first, isolated, and, identified, benzene, in, 1825, from, the, oily, residue, derived, from, the, production, of, illuminating, gas, giving, it, the, name, bicarburet, of, hydrogen, in, 1833, eilhard, mitscherlich, produced, it, by, distilling, benzoic, acid, from, gum, benzoin, and, lime, he, gave, the, compound, the, name, benzin, in, 1836, the, french, chemist, auguste, laurent, named, the, substance, ph, ne, this, word, has, become, the, root, of, the, english, word, phenol, which, is, hydroxylated, benzene, and, phenyl, the, radical, formed, by, abstraction, of, a, hydrogen, atom, from, benzene, in, 1845, charles, blachford, mansfield, working, under, august, wilhelm, von, hofmann, isolated, benzene, from, coal, tar, four, years, later, mansfield, began, the, first, industrial, scale, production, of, benzene, based, on, the, coal, tar, method, gradually, the, sense, developed, among, chemists, that, a, number, of, substances, were, chemically, related, to, benzene, comprising, a, diverse, chemical, family, in, 1855, hofmann, was, the, first, to, apply, the, word, aromatic, to, designate, this, family, relationship, after, a, characteristic, property, of, many, of, its, members, in, 1997, benzene, was, detected, in, deep, space, the, empirical, formula, for, benzene, was, long, known, but, its, highly, polyunsaturated, structure, with, just, one, hydrogen, atom, for, each, carbon, atom, was, challenging, to, determine, archibald, scott, couper, in, 1858, and, johann, josef, loschmidt, in, 1861, suggested, possible, structures, that, contained, multiple, double, bonds, or, multiple, rings, but, in, these, years, very, little, was, known, about, aromatic, chemistry, and, so, chemists, were, unable, to, adduce, appropriate, evidence, to, favor, any, particular, formula, but, many, chemists, had, begun, to, work, on, aromatic, substances, especially, in, germany, and, relevant, data, was, coming, fast, in, 1865, the, german, chemist, friedrich, august, kekul, published, a, paper, in, french, for, he, was, then, teaching, in, francophone, belgium, suggesting, that, the, structure, contained, a, ring, of, six, carbon, atoms, with, alternating, single, and, double, bonds, the, next, year, he, published, a, much, longer, paper, in, german, on, the, same, subject, kekul, used, evidence, that, had, accumulated, in, the, intervening, years, namely, that, there, always, appeared, to, be, only, one, isomer, of, any, monoderivative, of, benzene, and, that, there, always, appeared, to, be, exactly, three, isomers, of, every, disubstituted, derivative, now, understood, to, correspond, to, the, ortho, meta, and, para, patterns, of, arene, substitution, to, argue, in, support, of, his, proposed, structure, kekul, s, symmetrical, ring, could, explain, these, curious, facts, as, well, as, benzene, s, 1, 1, carbon, hydrogen, ratio, the, new, understanding, of, benzene, and, hence, of, all, aromatic, compounds, proved, to, be, so, important, for, both, pure, and, applied, chemistry, that, in, 1890, the, german, chemical, society, organized, an, elaborate, appreciation, in, kekul, s, honor, celebrating, the, twenty, fifth, anniversary, of, his, first, benzene, paper, here, kekul, spoke, of, the, creation, of, the, theory, he, said, that, he, had, discovered, the, ring, shape, of, the, benzene, molecule, after, having, a, reverie, or, day, dream, of, a, snake, biting, its, own, tail, a, symbol, in, ancient, cultures, known, as, the, ouroboros, this, vision, he, said, came, to, him, after, years, of, studying, the, nature, of, carbon, carbon, bonds, this, was, seven, years, after, he, had, solved, the, problem, of, how, carbon, atoms, could, bond, to, up, to, four, other, atoms, at, the, same, time, curiously, a, similar, humorous, depiction, of, benzene, had, appeared, in, 1886, in, a, pamphlet, entitled, berichte, der, durstigen, chemischen, gesellschaft, journal, of, the, thirsty, chemical, society, a, parody, of, the, berichte, der, deutschen, chemischen, gesellschaft, only, the, parody, had, monkeys, seizing, each, other, in, a, circle, rather, than, snakes, as, in, kekul, s, anecdote, some, historians, have, suggested, that, the, parody, was, a, lampoon, of, the, snake, anecdote, possibly, already, well, known, through, oral, transmission, even, if, it, had, not, yet, appeared, in, print, kekul, s, 1890, speech, in, which, this, anecdote, appeared, has, been, translated, into, english, if, the, anecdote, is, the, memory, of, a, real, event, circumstances, mentioned, in, the, story, suggest, that, it, must, have, happened, early, in, 1862, in, 1929, the, cyclic, nature, of, benzene, was, finally, confirmed, by, the, crystallographer, kathleen, lonsdale, using, x, ray, diffraction, methods, using, large, crystals, of, hexamethylbenzene, a, benzene, derivative, with, the, same, core, of, six, carbon, atoms, lonsdale, obtained, diffraction, patterns, through, calculating, more, than, thirty, parameters, lonsdale, demonstrated, that, the, benzene, ring, could, not, be, anything, but, a, flat, hexagon, and, provided, accurate, distances, for, all, carbon, carbon, bonds, in, the, molecule, the, german, chemist, wilhelm, k, rner, suggested, the, prefixes, ortho, meta, para, to, distinguish, di, substituted, benzene, derivatives, in, 1867, however, he, did, not, use, the, prefixes, to, distinguish, the, relative, positions, of, the, substituents, on, a, benzene, ring, it, was, the, german, chemist, carl, gr, be, who, in, 1869, first, used, the, prefixes, ortho, meta, para, to, denote, specific, relative, locations, of, the, substituents, on, a, di, substituted, aromatic, ring, viz, naphthalene, in, 1870, the, german, chemist, viktor, meyer, first, applied, gr, be, s, nomenclature, to, benzene, in, 1903, ludwig, roselius, popularized, the, use, of, benzene, to, decaffeinate, coffee, this, discovery, led, to, the, production, of, sanka, this, process, was, later, discontinued, benzene, was, historically, used, as, a, significant, component, in, many, consumer, products, such, as, liquid, wrench, several, paint, strippers, rubber, cements, spot, removers, and, other, products, manufacture, of, some, of, these, benzene, containing, formulations, ceased, in, about, 1950, although, liquid, wrench, continued, to, contain, significant, amounts, of, benzene, until, the, late, 1970s, trace, amounts, of, benzene, are, found, in, petroleum, and, coal, it, is, a, byproduct, of, the, incomplete, combustion, of, many, materials, for, commercial, use, until, world, war, ii, much, of, benzene, was, obtained, as, a, by, product, of, coke, production, or, coke, oven, light, oil, for, the, steel, industry, however, in, the, 1950s, increased, demand, for, benzene, especially, from, the, growing, polymers, industry, necessitated, the, production, of, benzene, from, petroleum, today, most, benzene, comes, from, the, petrochemical, industry, with, only, a, small, fraction, being, produced, from, coal, benzene, has, been, detected, on, mars, x, ray, diffraction, shows, that, all, six, carbon, carbon, bonds, in, benzene, are, of, the, same, length, at, 140, picometres, pm, the, c, c, bond, lengths, are, greater, than, a, double, bond, 135, pm, but, shorter, than, a, single, bond, 147, pm, this, intermediate, distance, is, caused, by, electron, delocalization, the, electrons, for, c, c, bonding, are, distributed, equally, between, each, of, the, six, carbon, atoms, benzene, has, 6, hydrogen, atoms, fewer, than, the, corresponding, parent, alkane, hexane, which, has, 14, benzene, and, cyclohexane, have, a, similar, structure, only, the, ring, of, delocalized, electrons, and, the, loss, of, one, hydrogen, per, carbon, distinguishes, it, from, cyclohexane, the, molecule, is, planar, the, molecular, orbital, description, involves, the, formation, of, three, delocalized, orbitals, spanning, all, six, carbon, atoms, while, the, valence, bond, description, involves, a, superposition, of, resonance, structures, it, is, likely, that, this, stability, contributes, to, the, peculiar, molecular, and, chemical, properties, known, as, aromaticity, to, reflect, the, delocalized, nature, of, the, bonding, benzene, is, often, depicted, with, a, circle, inside, a, hexagonal, arrangement, of, carbon, atoms, derivatives, of, benzene, occur, sufficiently, often, as, a, component, of, organic, molecules, so, much, so, that, the, unicode, consortium, has, allocated, a, symbol, in, the, miscellaneous, technical, block, with, the, code, u, 232c, to, represent, it, with, three, double, bonds, and, u, 23e3, for, a, delocalized, version, many, important, chemical, compounds, are, derived, from, benzene, by, replacing, one, or, more, of, its, hydrogen, atoms, with, another, functional, group, examples, of, simple, benzene, derivatives, are, phenol, toluene, and, aniline, abbreviated, phoh, phme, and, phnh, 2, respectively, linking, benzene, rings, gives, biphenyl, c, 6, h, 5, c, 6, h, 5, further, loss, of, hydrogen, gives, fused, aromatic, hydrocarbons, such, as, naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, and, pyrene, the, limit, of, the, fusion, process, is, the, hydrogen, free, allotrope, of, carbon, graphite, in, heterocycles, carbon, atoms, in, the, benzene, ring, are, replaced, with, other, elements, the, most, important, variations, contain, nitrogen, replacing, one, ch, with, n, gives, the, compound, pyridine, c, 5, h, 5, n, although, benzene, and, pyridine, are, structurally, related, benzene, cannot, be, converted, into, pyridine, replacement, of, a, second, ch, bond, with, n, gives, depending, on, the, location, of, the, second, n, pyridazine, pyrimidine, or, pyrazine, four, chemical, processes, contribute, to, industrial, benzene, production, catalytic, reforming, toluene, hydrodealkylation, toluene, disproportionation, and, steam, cracking, etc, according, to, the, atsdr, toxicological, profile, for, benzene, between, 1978, and, 1981, catalytic, reformates, accounted, for, approximately, 44, 50, of, the, total, u, s, benzene, production, in, catalytic, reforming, a, mixture, of, hydrocarbons, with, boiling, points, between, 60, and, 200, c, is, blended, with, hydrogen, gas, and, then, exposed, to, a, bifunctional, platinum, chloride, or, rhenium, chloride, catalyst, at, 500, 525, c, and, pressures, ranging, from, 8, 50, atm, under, these, conditions, aliphatic, hydrocarbons, form, rings, and, lose, hydrogen, to, become, aromatic, hydrocarbons, the, aromatic, products, of, the, reaction, are, then, separated, from, the, reaction, mixture, or, reformate, by, extraction, with, any, one, of, a, number, of, solvents, including, diethylene, glycol, or, sulfolane, and, benzene, is, then, separated, from, the, other, aromatics, by, distillation, the, extraction, step, of, aromatics, from, the, reformate, is, designed, to, produce, aromatics, with, lowest, non, aromatic, components, recovery, of, the, aromatics, commonly, referred, to, as, btx, benzene, toluene, and, xylene, isomers, involves, such, extraction, and, distillation, steps, in, similar, fashion, to, this, catalytic, reforming, uop, and, bp, commercialized, a, method, from, lpg, mainly, propane, and, butane, to, aromatics, toluene, hydrodealkylation, converts, toluene, to, benzene, in, this, hydrogen, intensive, process, toluene, is, mixed, with, hydrogen, then, passed, over, a, chromium, molybdenum, or, platinum, oxide, catalyst, at, 500, 650, c, and, 20, 60, atm, pressure, sometimes, higher, temperatures, are, used, instead, of, a, catalyst, at, the, similar, reaction, condition, under, these, conditions, toluene, undergoes, dealkylation, to, benzene, and, methane, this, irreversible, reaction, is, accompanied, by, an, equilibrium, side, reaction, that, produces, biphenyl, aka, diphenyl, at, higher, temperature, if, the, raw, material, stream, contains, much, non, aromatic, components, paraffins, or, naphthenes, those, are, likely, decomposed, to, lower, hydrocarbons, such, as, methane, which, increases, the, consumption, of, hydrogen, a, typical, reaction, yield, exceeds, 95, sometimes, xylenes, and, heavier, aromatics, are, used, in, place, of, toluene, with, similar, efficiency, this, is, often, called, on, purpose, methodology, to, produce, benzene, compared, to, conventional, btx, benzene, toluene, xylene, extraction, processes, toluene, disproportionation, tdp, is, the, conversion, of, toluene, to, benzene, and, xylene, given, that, demand, for, para, xylene, p, xylene, substantially, exceeds, demand, for, other, xylene, isomers, a, refinement, of, the, tdp, process, called, selective, tdp, stdp, may, be, used, in, this, process, the, xylene, stream, exiting, the, tdp, unit, is, approximately, 90, p, xylene, in, some, systems, even, the, benzene, to, xylenes, ratio, is, modified, to, favor, xylenes, steam, cracking, is, the, process, for, producing, ethylene, and, other, alkenes, from, aliphatic, hydrocarbons, depending, on, the, feedstock, used, to, produce, the, olefins, steam, cracking, can, produce, a, benzene, rich, liquid, by, product, called, pyrolysis, gasoline, pyrolysis, gasoline, can, be, blended, with, other, hydrocarbons, as, a, gasoline, additive, or, routed, through, an, extraction, process, to, recover, btx, aromatics, benzene, toluene, and, xylenes, although, of, no, commercial, significance, many, other, routes, to, benzene, exist, phenol, and, halobenzenes, can, be, reduced, with, metals, benzoic, acid, and, its, salts, undergo, decarboxylation, to, benzene, the, reaction, of, the, diazonium, compound, derived, from, aniline, with, hypophosphorus, acid, gives, benzene, alkyne, trimerisation, of, acetylene, gives, benzene, complete, decarboxylation, of, mellitic, acid, gives, benzene, benzene, is, used, mainly, as, an, intermediate, to, make, other, chemicals, above, all, ethylbenzene, and, other, alkylbenzenes, cumene, cyclohexane, and, nitrobenzene, in, 1988, it, was, reported, that, two, thirds, of, all, chemicals, on, the, american, chemical, society, s, lists, contained, at, least, one, benzene, ring, more, than, half, of, the, entire, benzene, production, is, processed, into, ethylbenzene, a, precursor, to, styrene, which, is, used, to, make, polymers, and, plastics, like, polystyrene, some, 20, of, the, benzene, production, is, used, to, manufacture, cumene, which, is, needed, to, produce, phenol, and, acetone, for, resins, and, adhesives, cyclohexane, consumes, around, 10, of, the, world, s, benzene, production, it, is, primarily, used, in, the, manufacture, of, nylon, fibers, which, are, processed, into, textiles, and, engineering, plastics, smaller, amounts, of, benzene, are, used, to, make, some, types, of, rubbers, lubricants, dyes, detergents, drugs, explosives, and, pesticides, in, 2013, the, biggest, consumer, country, of, benzene, was, china, followed, by, the, usa, benzene, production, is, currently, expanding, in, the, middle, east, and, in, africa, whereas, production, capacities, in, western, europe, and, north, america, are, stagnating, toluene, is, now, often, used, as, a, substitute, for, benzene, for, instance, as, a, fuel, additive, the, solvent, properties, of, the, two, are, similar, but, toluene, is, less, toxic, and, has, a, wider, liquid, range, toluene, is, also, processed, into, benzene, as, a, gasoline, petrol, additive, benzene, increases, the, octane, rating, and, reduces, knocking, as, a, consequence, gasoline, often, contained, several, percent, benzene, before, the, 1950s, when, tetraethyl, lead, replaced, it, as, the, most, widely, used, antiknock, additive, with, the, global, phaseout, of, leaded, gasoline, benzene, has, made, a, comeback, as, a, gasoline, additive, in, some, nations, in, the, united, states, concern, over, its, negative, health, effects, and, the, possibility, of, benzene, entering, the, groundwater, has, led, to, stringent, regulation, of, gasoline, s, benzene, content, with, limits, typically, around, 1, european, petrol, specifications, now, contain, the, same, 1, limit, on, benzene, content, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, introduced, new, regulations, in, 2011, that, lowered, the, benzene, content, in, gasoline, to, 0, 62, in, some, european, languages, the, word, for, petroleum, or, gasoline, is, an, exact, cognate, of, benzene, for, instance, in, catalan, the, word, benzina, can, be, used, for, gasoline, though, now, it, is, relatively, rare, the, most, common, reactions, of, benzene, involve, substitution, of, a, proton, by, other, groups, electrophilic, aromatic, substitution, is, a, general, method, of, derivatizing, benzene, benzene, is, sufficiently, nucleophilic, that, it, undergoes, substitution, by, acylium, ions, and, alkyl, carbocations, to, give, substituted, derivatives, the, most, widely, practiced, example, of, this, reaction, is, the, ethylation, of, benzene, approximately, 24, 700, 000, tons, were, produced, in, 1999, highly, instructive, but, of, far, less, industrial, significance, is, the, friedel, crafts, alkylation, of, benzene, and, many, other, aromatic, rings, using, an, alkyl, halide, in, the, presence, of, a, strong, lewis, acid, catalyst, similarly, the, friedel, crafts, acylation, is, a, related, example, of, electrophilic, aromatic, substitution, the, reaction, involves, the, acylation, of, benzene, or, many, other, aromatic, rings, with, an, acyl, chloride, using, a, strong, lewis, acid, catalyst, such, as, aluminium, chloride, or, iron, iii, chloride, using, electrophilic, aromatic, substitution, many, functional, groups, are, introduced, onto, the, benzene, framework, sulfonation, of, benzene, involves, the, use, of, oleum, a, mixture, of, sulfuric, acid, with, sulfur, trioxide, sulfonated, benzene, derivatives, are, useful, detergents, in, nitration, benzene, reacts, with, nitronium, ions, no, 2, which, is, a, strong, electrophile, produced, by, combining, sulfuric, and, nitric, acids, nitrobenzene, is, the, precursor, to, aniline, chlorination, is, achieved, with, chlorine, to, give, chlorobenzene, in, the, presence, of, a, lewis, acid, catalyst, such, as, aluminium, tri, chloride, via, hydrogenation, benzene, and, its, derivatives, convert, to, cyclohexane, and, derivatives, this, reaction, is, achieved, by, the, use, of, high, pressures, of, hydrogen, in, the, presence, of, heterogeneous, catalysts, such, as, finely, divided, nickel, whereas, alkenes, can, be, hydrogenated, near, room, temperatures, benzene, and, related, compounds, are, more, reluctant, substrates, requiring, temperatures, 100, c, this, reaction, is, practiced, on, a, large, scale, industrially, in, the, absence, of, the, catalyst, benzene, is, impervious, to, hydrogen, hydrogenation, cannot, be, stopped, to, give, cyclohexene, or, cyclohexadienes, as, these, are, superior, substrates, birch, reduction, a, non, catalytic, process, however, selectively, hydrogenates, benzene, to, the, diene, benzene, is, an, excellent, ligand, in, the, organometallic, chemistry, of, low, valent, metals, important, examples, include, the, sandwich, and, half, sandwich, complexes, respectively, cr, c, 6, h, 6, 2, and, 2, benzene, is, classified, as, a, carcinogen, which, increases, the, risk, of, cancer, and, other, illnesses, and, is, also, a, notorious, cause, of, bone, marrow, failure, substantial, quantities, of, epidemiologic, clinical, and, laboratory, data, link, benzene, to, aplastic, anemia, acute, leukemia, bone, marrow, abnormalities, and, cardiovascular, disease, the, specific, hematologic, malignancies, that, benzene, is, associated, with, include, acute, myeloid, leukemia, aml, aplastic, anemia, myelodysplastic, syndrome, mds, acute, lymphoblastic, leukemia, all, and, chronic, myeloid, leukemia, cml, the, american, petroleum, institute, api, stated, as, early, as, 1948, that, it, is, generally, considered, that, the, only, absolutely, safe, concentration, for, benzene, is, zero, there, is, no, safe, exposure, level, even, tiny, amounts, can, cause, harm, the, us, department, of, health, and, human, services, dhhs, classifies, benzene, as, a, human, carcinogen, long, term, exposure, to, excessive, levels, of, benzene, in, the, air, causes, leukemia, a, potentially, fatal, cancer, of, the, blood, forming, organs, in, particular, acute, myeloid, leukemia, or, acute, nonlymphocytic, leukemia, aml, anll, is, caused, by, benzene, iarc, rated, benzene, as, known, to, be, carcinogenic, to, humans, group, 1, as, benzene, is, ubiquitous, in, gasoline, and, hydrocarbon, fuels, that, are, in, use, everywhere, human, exposure, to, benzene, is, a, global, health, problem, benzene, targets, the, liver, kidney, lung, heart, and, brain, and, can, cause, dna, strand, breaks, and, chromosomal, damage, hence, is, teratogenic, and, mutagenic, benzene, causes, cancer, in, animals, including, humans, benzene, has, been, shown, to, cause, cancer, in, both, sexes, of, multiple, species, of, laboratory, animals, exposed, via, various, routes, according, to, the, agency, for, toxic, substances, and, disease, registry, atsdr, 2007, benzene, is, both, a, synthetically, made, and, naturally, occurring, chemical, from, processes, that, include, volcanic, eruptions, wild, fires, synthesis, of, chemicals, such, as, phenol, production, of, synthetic, fibers, and, fabrication, of, rubbers, lubricants, pesticides, medications, and, dyes, the, major, sources, of, benzene, exposure, are, tobacco, smoke, automobile, service, stations, exhaust, from, motor, vehicles, and, industrial, emissions, however, ingestion, and, dermal, absorption, of, benzene, can, also, occur, through, contact, with, contaminated, water, benzene, is, hepatically, metabolized, and, excreted, in, the, urine, measurement, of, air, and, water, levels, of, benzene, is, accomplished, through, collection, via, activated, charcoal, tubes, which, are, then, analyzed, with, a, gas, chromatograph, the, measurement, of, benzene, in, humans, can, be, accomplished, via, urine, blood, and, breath, tests, however, all, of, these, have, their, limitations, because, benzene, is, rapidly, metabolized, in, the, human, body, exposure, to, benzene, may, lead, progressively, to, aplastic, anemia, leukaemia, and, multiple, myeloma, osha, regulates, levels, of, benzene, in, the, workplace, the, maximum, allowable, amount, of, benzene, in, workroom, air, during, an, 8, hour, workday, 40, hour, workweek, is, 1, ppm, as, benzene, can, cause, cancer, niosh, recommends, that, all, workers, wear, special, breathing, equipment, when, they, are, likely, to, be, exposed, to, benzene, at, levels, exceeding, the, recommended, 8, hour, exposure, limit, of, 0, 1, ppm, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, has, set, a, maximum, contaminant, level, for, benzene, in, drinking, water, at, 0, 005, mg, l, 5, ppb, as, promulgated, via, the, u, s, national, primary, drinking, water, regulations, this, regulation, is, based, on, preventing, benzene, leukemogenesis, the, maximum, contaminant, level, goal, mclg, a, nonenforceable, health, goal, that, would, allow, an, adequate, margin, of, safety, for, the, prevention, of, adverse, effects, is, zero, benzene, concentration, in, drinking, water, the, epa, requires, that, spills, or, accidental, releases, into, the, environment, of, 10, pounds, 4, 5, kg, or, more, of, benzene, be, reported, the, u, s, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, has, set, a, permissible, exposure, limit, of, 1, part, of, benzene, per, million, parts, of, air, 1, ppm, in, the, workplace, during, an, 8, hour, workday, 40, hour, workweek, the, short, term, exposure, limit, for, airborne, benzene, is, 5, ppm, for, 15, minutes, these, legal, limits, were, based, on, studies, demonstrating, compelling, evidence, of, health, risk, to, workers, exposed, to, benzene, the, risk, from, exposure, to, 1, ppm, for, a, working, lifetime, has, been, estimated, as, 5, excess, leukemia, deaths, per, 1, 000, employees, exposed, this, estimate, assumes, no, threshold, for, benzene, s, carcinogenic, effects, osha, has, also, established, an, action, level, of, 0, 5, ppm, to, encourage, even, lower, exposures, in, the, workplace, the, u, s, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, revised, the, immediately, dangerous, to, life, and, health, idlh, concentration, for, benzene, to, 500, ppm, the, current, niosh, definition, for, an, idlh, condition, as, given, in, the, niosh, respirator, selection, logic, is, one, that, poses, a, threat, of, exposure, to, airborne, contaminants, when, that, exposure, is, likely, to, cause, death, or, immediate, or, delayed, permanent, adverse, health, effects, or, prevent, escape, from, such, an, environment, the, purpose, of, establishing, an, idlh, value, is, 1, to, ensure, that, the, worker, can, escape, from, a, given, contaminated, environment, in, the, event, of, failure, of, the, respiratory, protection, equipment, and, 2, is, considered, a, maximum, level, above, which, only, a, highly, reliable, breathing, apparatus, providing, maximum, worker, protection, is, permitted, in, september, 1995, niosh, issued, a, new, policy, for, developing, recommended, exposure, limits, rels, for, substances, including, carcinogens, as, benzene, can, cause, cancer, niosh, recommends, that, all, workers, wear, special, breathing, equipment, when, they, are, likely, to, be, exposed, to, benzene, at, levels, exceeding, the, rel, 10, hour, of, 0, 1, ppm, the, niosh, short, term, exposure, limit, stel, 15, min, is, 1, ppm, american, conference, of, governmental, industrial, hygienists, acgih, adopted, threshold, limit, values, tlvs, for, benzene, at, 0, 5, ppm, twa, and, 2, 5, ppm, stel, several, tests, can, determine, exposure, to, benzene, benzene, itself, can, be, measured, in, breath, blood, or, urine, but, such, testing, is, usually, limited, to, the, first, 24, hours, post, exposure, due, to, the, relatively, rapid, removal, of, the, chemical, by, exhalation, or, biotransformation, most, people, in, developed, countries, have, measureable, baseline, levels, of, benzene, and, other, aromatic, petroleum, hydrocarbons, in, their, blood, in, the, body, benzene, is, enzymatically, converted, to, a, series, of, oxidation, products, including, muconic, acid, phenylmercapturic, acid, phenol, catechol, hydroquinone, and, 1, 2, 4, trihydroxybenzene, most, of, these, metabolites, have, some, value, as, biomarkers, of, human, exposure, since, they, accumulate, in, the, urine, in, proportion, to, the, extent, and, duration, of, exposure, and, they, may, still, be, present, for, some, days, after, exposure, has, ceased, the, current, acgih, biological, exposure, limits, for, occupational, exposure, are, 500, g, g, creatinine, for, muconic, acid, and, 25, g, g, creatinine, for, phenylmercapturic, acid, in, an, end, of, shift, urine, specimen, even, if, it, is, not, a, common, substrate, for, metabolism, benzene, can, be, oxidized, by, both, bacteria, and, eukaryotes, in, bacteria, dioxygenase, enzyme, can, add, an, oxygen, to, the, ring, and, the, unstable, product, is, immediately, reduced, by, nadh, to, a, cyclic, diol, with, two, double, bonds, breaking, the, aromaticity, next, the, diol, is, newly, reduced, by, nadh, to, catechol, the, catechol, is, then, metabolized, to, acetyl, coa, and, succinyl, coa, used, by, organisms, mainly, in, the, citric, acid, cycle, for, energy, production, the, pathway, for, the, metabolism, of, benzene, is, complex, and, begins, in, the, liver, several, enzymes, are, involved, these, include, cytochrome, p450, 2e1, cyp2e1, quinine, oxidoreductase, nq01, or, dt, diaphorase, or, nad, p, h, dehydrogenase, quinone, 1, gsh, and, myeloperoxidase, mpo, cyp2e1, is, involved, at, multiple, steps, converting, benzene, to, oxepin, benzene, oxide, phenol, to, hydroquinone, and, hydroquinone, to, both, benzenetriol, and, catechol, hydroquinone, benzenetriol, and, catechol, are, converted, to, polyphenols, in, the, bone, marrow, mpo, converts, these, polyphenols, to, benzoquinones, these, intermediates, and, metabolites, induce, genotoxicity, by, multiple, mechanisms, including, inhibition, of, topoisomerase, ii, which, maintains, chromosome, structure, disruption, of, microtubules, which, maintains, cellular, structure, and, organization, generation, of, oxygen, free, radicals, unstable, species, that, may, lead, to, point, mutations, increasing, oxidative, stress, inducing, dna, strand, breaks, and, altering, dna, methylation, which, can, affect, gene, expression, nq01, and, gsh, shift, metabolism, away, from, toxicity, nq01, metabolizes, benzoquinone, toward, polyphenols, counteracting, the, effect, of, mpo, gsh, is, involved, with, the, formation, of, phenylmercapturic, acid, genetic, polymorphisms, in, these, enzymes, may, induce, loss, of, function, or, gain, of, function, for, example, mutations, in, cyp2e1, increase, activity, and, result, in, increased, generation, of, toxic, metabolites, nq01, mutations, result, in, loss, of, function, and, may, result, in, decreased, detoxification, myeloperoxidase, mutations, result, in, loss, of, function, and, may, result, in, decreased, generation, of, toxic, metabolites, gsh, mutations, or, deletions, result, in, loss, of, function, and, result, in, decreased, detoxification, these, genes, may, be, targets, for, genetic, screening, for, susceptibility, to, benzene, toxicity, the, paradigm, of, toxicological, assessment, of, benzene, is, shifting, towards, the, domain, of, molecular, toxicology, as, it, allows, understanding, of, fundamental, biological, mechanisms, in, a, better, way, glutathione, seems, to, play, an, important, role, by, protecting, against, benzene, induced, dna, breaks, and, it, is, being, identified, as, a, new, biomarker, for, exposure, and, effect, benzene, causes, chromosomal, aberrations, in, the, peripheral, blood, leukocytes, and, bone, marrow, explaining, the, higher, incidence, of, leukemia, and, multiple, myeloma, caused, by, chronic, exposure, these, aberrations, can, be, monitored, using, fluorescent, in, situ, hybridization, fish, with, dna, probes, to, assess, the, effects, of, benzene, along, with, the, hematological, tests, as, markers, of, hematotoxicity, benzene, metabolism, involves, enzymes, coded, for, by, polymorphic, genes, studies, have, shown, that, genotype, at, these, loci, may, influence, susceptibility, to, the, toxic, effects, of, benzene, exposure, individuals, carrying, variant, of, nad, p, h, quinone, oxidoreductase, 1, nqo1, microsomal, epoxide, hydrolase, ephx, and, deletion, of, the, glutathione, s, transferase, t1, gstt1, showed, a, greater, frequency, of, dna, single, stranded, breaks, one, way, of, understanding, the, carcinogenic, effects, of, benzene, is, by, examining, the, products, of, biological, oxidation, pure, benzene, for, example, oxidizes, in, the, body, to, produce, an, epoxide, benzene, oxide, which, is, not, excreted, readily, and, can, interact, with, dna, to, produce, harmful, mutations, outdoor, air, may, contain, low, levels, of, benzene, from, automobile, service, stations, wood, smoke, tobacco, smoke, the, transfer, of, gasoline, exhaust, from, motor, vehicles, and, industrial, emissions, about, 50, of, the, entire, nationwide, united, states, exposure, to, benzene, results, from, smoking, tobacco, or, from, exposure, to, tobacco, smoke, after, smoking, 32, cigarettes, per, day, the, smoker, would, take, in, about, 1, 8, milligrams, mg, of, benzene, this, amount, is, about, 10, times, the, average, daily, intake, of, benzene, by, nonsmokers, inhaled, benzene, is, primarily, expelled, unchanged, through, exhalation, in, a, human, study, 16, 4, to, 41, 6, of, retained, benzene, was, eliminated, through, the, lungs, within, five, to, seven, hours, after, a, two, to, three, hour, exposure, to, 47, to, 110, ppm, and, only, 0, 07, to, 0, 2, of, the, remaining, benzene, was, excreted, unchanged, in, the, urine, after, exposure, to, 63, to, 405, mg, m, 3, of, benzene, for, 1, to, 5, hours, 51, to, 87, was, excreted, in, the, urine, as, phenol, over, a, period, of, 23, to, 50, hours, in, another, human, study, 30, of, absorbed, dermally, applied, benzene, which, is, primarily, metabolized, in, the, liver, was, excreted, as, phenol, in, the, urine, under, specific, conditions, and, in, the, presence, of, other, chemicals, benzoic, acid, a, preservative, and, ascorbic, acid, vitamin, c, may, interact, to, produce, benzene, in, march, 2006, the, official, food, standards, agency, in, united, kingdom, conducted, a, survey, of, 150, brands, of, soft, drinks, it, found, that, four, contained, benzene, levels, above, world, health, organization, limits, the, affected, batches, were, removed, from, sale, similar, problems, were, reported, by, the, fda, in, the, united, states, in, 2005, the, water, supply, to, the, city, of, harbin, in, china, with, a, population, of, almost, nine, million, people, was, cut, off, because, of, a, major, benzene, exposure, benzene, leaked, into, the, songhua, river, which, supplies, drinking, water, to, the, city, after, an, explosion, at, a, china, national, petroleum, corporation, cnpc, factory, in, the, city, of, jilin, on, 13, november, 2005, when, plastic, water, pipes, are, subject, to, high, heat, the, water, may, be, contaminated, with, benzene, the, nazi, german, government, used, benzene, administered, via, injection, as, one, of, their, many, methods, for, killing
