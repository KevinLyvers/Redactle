the, litre, commonwealth, spelling, or, liter, american, spelling, si, symbols, l, and, l, other, symbol, used, is, a, metric, unit, of, volume, it, is, equal, to, 1, cubic, decimetre, dm, 3, 1000, cubic, centimetres, cm, 3, or, 0, 001, cubic, metres, m, 3, a, cubic, decimetre, or, litre, occupies, a, volume, of, 10, cm, 10, cm, 10, cm, see, figure, and, is, thus, equal, to, one, thousandth, of, a, cubic, metre, the, original, french, metric, system, used, the, litre, as, a, base, unit, the, word, litre, is, derived, from, an, older, french, unit, the, litron, whose, name, came, from, byzantine, greek, where, it, was, a, unit, of, weight, not, volume, via, late, medieval, latin, and, which, equalled, approximately, 0, 831, litres, the, litre, was, also, used, in, several, subsequent, versions, of, the, metric, system, and, is, accepted, for, use, with, the, si, although, not, an, si, unit, the, si, unit, of, volume, is, the, cubic, metre, m, 3, the, spelling, used, by, the, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, is, litre, a, spelling, which, is, shared, by, most, english, speaking, countries, the, spelling, liter, is, predominantly, used, in, american, english, one, litre, of, liquid, water, has, a, mass, of, almost, exactly, one, kilogram, because, the, kilogram, was, originally, defined, in, 1795, as, the, mass, of, one, cubic, decimetre, of, water, at, the, temperature, of, melting, ice, 0, c, subsequent, redefinitions, of, the, metre, and, kilogram, mean, that, this, relationship, is, no, longer, exact, a, litre, is, a, cubic, decimetre, which, is, the, volume, of, a, cube, 10, centimetres, 10, centimetres, 10, centimetres, 1, l, 1, dm, 3, 1000, cm, 3, hence, 1, l, 0, 001, m, 3, 1000, cm, 3, and, 1, m, 3, i, e, a, cubic, metre, which, is, the, si, unit, for, volume, is, exactly, 1000, l, from, 1901, to, 1964, the, litre, was, defined, as, the, volume, of, one, kilogram, of, pure, water, at, maximum, density, 3, 98, c, and, standard, pressure, the, kilogram, was, in, turn, specified, as, the, mass, of, the, international, prototype, of, the, kilogram, a, specific, platinum, iridium, cylinder, and, was, intended, to, be, of, the, same, mass, as, the, 1, litre, of, water, referred, to, above, it, was, subsequently, discovered, that, the, cylinder, was, around, 28, parts, per, million, too, large, and, thus, during, this, time, a, litre, was, about, 1, 000, 028, dm, 3, additionally, the, mass, volume, relationship, of, water, as, with, any, fluid, depends, on, temperature, pressure, purity, and, isotopic, uniformity, in, 1964, the, definition, relating, the, litre, to, mass, was, superseded, by, the, current, one, although, the, litre, is, not, an, si, unit, it, is, accepted, by, the, cgpm, the, standards, body, that, defines, the, si, for, use, with, the, si, cgpm, defines, the, litre, and, its, acceptable, symbols, a, litre, is, equal, in, volume, to, the, millistere, an, obsolete, non, si, metric, unit, formerly, customarily, used, for, dry, measure, litres, are, most, commonly, used, for, items, such, as, fluids, and, solids, that, can, be, poured, which, are, measured, by, the, capacity, or, size, of, their, container, whereas, cubic, metres, and, derived, units, are, most, commonly, used, for, items, measured, either, by, their, dimensions, or, their, displacements, the, litre, is, often, also, used, in, some, calculated, measurements, such, as, density, kg, l, allowing, an, easy, comparison, with, the, density, of, water, one, litre, of, water, has, a, mass, of, almost, exactly, one, kilogram, when, measured, at, its, maximal, density, which, occurs, at, about, 4, c, it, follows, therefore, that, 1000th, of, a, litre, known, as, one, millilitre, 1, ml, of, water, has, a, mass, of, about, 1, g, 1000, litres, of, water, has, a, mass, of, about, 1000, kg, 1, tonne, or, megagram, this, relationship, holds, because, the, gram, was, originally, defined, as, the, mass, of, 1, ml, of, water, however, this, definition, was, abandoned, in, 1799, because, the, density, of, water, changes, with, temperature, and, very, slightly, with, pressure, it, is, now, known, that, the, density, of, water, also, depends, on, the, isotopic, ratios, of, the, oxygen, and, hydrogen, atoms, in, a, particular, sample, modern, measurements, of, vienna, standard, mean, ocean, water, which, is, pure, distilled, water, with, an, isotopic, composition, representative, of, the, average, of, the, world, s, oceans, show, that, it, has, a, density, of, 0, 999, 975, 0, 000, 001, kg, l, at, its, point, of, maximum, density, 3, 984, c, under, one, standard, atmosphere, 101, 325, kpa, of, pressure, the, litre, though, not, an, official, si, unit, may, be, used, with, si, prefixes, the, most, commonly, used, derived, unit, is, the, millilitre, defined, as, one, thousandth, of, a, litre, and, also, often, referred, to, by, the, si, derived, unit, name, cubic, centimetre, it, is, a, commonly, used, measure, especially, in, medicine, cooking, and, automotive, engineering, other, units, may, be, found, in, the, table, below, where, the, more, often, used, terms, are, in, bold, however, some, authorities, advise, against, some, of, them, for, example, in, the, united, states, nist, advocates, using, the, millilitre, or, litre, instead, of, the, centilitre, there, are, two, international, standard, symbols, for, the, litre, l, and, l, in, the, united, states, the, former, is, preferred, because, of, the, risk, that, in, some, fonts, the, letter, l, and, the, digit, 1, may, be, confused, see, also, imperial, units, and, us, customary, units, one, litre, is, slightly, larger, than, a, us, liquid, quart, and, slightly, less, than, an, imperial, quart, or, one, us, dry, quart, a, mnemonic, for, its, volume, relative, to, an, imperial, pint, is, a, litre, of, water, s, a, pint, and, three, quarters, this, is, very, close, as, a, litre, is, about, 1, 76, imperial, pints, a, cubic, foot, has, an, exact, volume, of, 28, 316846592, litres, originally, the, only, symbol, for, the, litre, was, l, lowercase, letter, l, following, the, si, convention, that, only, those, unit, symbols, that, abbreviate, the, name, of, a, person, start, with, a, capital, letter, in, many, english, speaking, countries, however, the, most, common, shape, of, a, handwritten, arabic, digit, 1, is, just, a, vertical, stroke, that, is, it, lacks, the, upstroke, added, in, many, other, cultures, therefore, the, digit, 1, may, easily, be, confused, with, the, letter, l, in, some, computer, typefaces, the, two, characters, are, barely, distinguishable, as, a, result, l, uppercase, letter, l, was, adopted, by, the, cipm, as, an, alternative, symbol, for, litre, in, 1979, the, united, states, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, now, recommends, the, use, of, the, uppercase, letter, l, a, practice, that, is, also, widely, followed, in, canada, and, australia, in, these, countries, the, symbol, l, is, also, used, with, prefixes, as, in, ml, and, l, instead, of, the, traditional, ml, and, l, used, in, europe, in, the, uk, and, ireland, as, well, as, the, rest, of, europe, lowercase, l, is, used, with, prefixes, though, whole, litres, are, often, written, in, full, so, 750, ml, on, a, wine, bottle, but, often, 1, litre, on, a, juice, carton, in, 1990, the, international, committee, for, weights, and, measures, stated, that, it, was, too, early, to, choose, a, single, symbol, for, the, litre, prior, to, 1979, the, symbol, came, into, common, use, in, some, countries, for, example, it, was, recommended, by, south, african, bureau, of, standards, publication, m33, and, canada, in, the, 1970s, this, symbol, can, still, be, encountered, occasionally, in, some, english, speaking, and, european, countries, like, germany, and, its, use, is, ubiquitous, in, japan, and, south, korea, fonts, covering, the, cjk, characters, usually, include, not, only, the, script, small, but, also, four, precomposed, characters, and, for, the, microlitre, millilitre, decilitre, and, kilolitre, to, allow, correct, rendering, for, vertically, written, scripts, these, have, unicode, equivalents, for, compatibility, which, are, not, recommended, for, use, with, new, documents, the, cjk, compatibility, block, also, includes, u, 3351, square, rittoru, corresponding, to, rittoru, japanese, for, litre, the, first, name, of, the, litre, was, cadil, standards, are, shown, at, the, mus, e, des, arts, et, m, tiers, in, paris, the, litre, was, introduced, in, france, in, 1795, as, one, of, the, new, republican, units, of, measurement, and, defined, as, one, cubic, decimetre, one, litre, of, liquid, water, has, a, mass, of, almost, exactly, one, kilogram, due, to, the, gram, being, defined, in, 1795, as, one, cubic, centimetre, of, water, at, the, temperature, of, melting, ice, the, original, decimetre, length, was, 44, 344, lignes, which, was, revised, in, 1798, to, 44, 3296, lignes, this, made, the, original, litre, 1, 000, 974, of, today, s, cubic, decimetre, it, was, against, this, litre, that, the, kilogram, was, constructed, in, 1879, the, cipm, adopted, the, definition, of, the, litre, with, the, symbol, l, lowercase, letter, l, in, 1901, at, the, 3rd, cgpm, conference, the, litre, was, redefined, as, the, space, occupied, by, 1, kg, of, pure, water, at, the, temperature, of, its, maximum, density, 3, 98, c, under, a, pressure, of, 1, atm, this, made, the, litre, equal, to, about, 1, 000, 028, dm, 3, earlier, reference, works, usually, put, it, at, 1, 000, 027, dm, 3, in, 1964, at, the, 12th, cgpm, conference, the, original, definition, was, reverted, to, and, thus, the, litre, was, once, again, defined, in, exact, relation, to, the, metre, as, another, name, for, the, cubic, decimetre, that, is, exactly, 1, dm, 3, in, 1979, at, the, 16th, cgpm, conference, the, alternative, symbol, l, uppercase, letter, l, was, adopted, it, also, expressed, a, preference, that, in, the, future, only, one, of, these, two, symbols, should, be, retained, but, in, 1990, said, it, was, still, too, early, to, do, so, in, spoken, english, the, symbol, ml, for, millilitre, can, be, pronounced, as, mil, this, can, potentially, cause, confusion, with, some, other, measurement, words, such, as, the, abbreviation, cc, for, cubic, centimetre, equal, to, a, millilitre, or, ml, is, a, unit, of, the, cgs, system, which, preceded, the, mks, system, which, later, evolved, into, the, si, system, the, abbreviation, cc, is, still, commonly, used, in, many, fields, including, medical, dosage, and, sizing, for, combustion, engine, displacement, the, microlitre, l, has, been, known, in, the, past, as, the, lambda, but, this, usage, is, now, discouraged, in, the, medical, field, the, microlitre, is, sometimes, abbreviated, as, mcl, on, test, results, in, the, si, system, apart, from, prefixes, for, powers, of, 1000, use, of, the, centi, 10, 2, deci, 10, 1, deca, 10, 1, and, hecto, 10, 2, prefixes, with, litres, is, common, for, example, in, many, european, countries, the, hectolitre, is, the, typical, unit, for, production, and, export, volumes, of, beverages, milk, beer, soft, drinks, wine, etc, and, for, measuring, the, size, of, the, catch, and, quotas, for, fishing, boats, decilitres, are, common, in, croatia, switzerland, and, scandinavia, and, often, found, in, cookbooks, and, restaurant, and, caf, menus, centilitres, indicate, the, capacity, of, drinking, glasses, and, of, small, bottles, in, colloquial, dutch, in, belgium, a, vijfentwintiger, and, a, drie, ndertiger, literally, twenty, fiver, and, thirty, threer, are, the, common, beer, glasses, the, corresponding, bottles, mention, 25, cl, and, 33, cl, bottles, may, also, be, 75, cl, or, half, size, at, 37, 5, cl, for, artisanal, brews, or, 70, cl, for, wines, or, spirits, cans, come, in, 25, cl, 33, cl, and, 50, cl, similarly, alcohol, shots, are, often, marked, in, cl, in, restaurant, menus, typically, 3, cl, 1, 06, imp, fl, oz, 1, 01, us, fl, oz, in, countries, where, the, metric, system, was, adopted, as, the, official, measuring, system, after, the, si, standard, was, established, common, usage, eschews, prefixes, that, are, not, powers, of, 1000, for, example, in, canada, australia, and, new, zealand, consumer, beverages, are, labelled, almost, exclusively, using, litres, and, millilitres, an, exception, is, in, pathology, where, for, instance, blood, lead, level, and, blood, sugar, level, may, be, measured, in, micrograms, milligrams, per, decilitre, for, larger, volumes, kilolitres, megalitres, and, gigalitres, have, been, used, by, the, northern, territory, government, for, measuring, water, consumption, reservoir, capacities, and, river, flows, although, cubic, metres, are, also, used, cubic, metres, are, generally, used, for, non, liquid, commodities, such, as, sand, and, gravel, or, storage, space
