white, is, the, lightest, color, and, is, achromatic, having, no, hue, it, is, the, color, of, objects, such, as, snow, chalk, and, milk, and, is, the, opposite, of, black, white, objects, fully, reflect, and, scatter, all, the, visible, wavelengths, of, light, white, on, television, and, computer, screens, is, created, by, a, mixture, of, red, blue, and, green, light, the, color, white, can, be, given, with, white, pigments, especially, titanium, dioxide, in, ancient, egypt, and, ancient, rome, priestesses, wore, white, as, a, symbol, of, purity, and, romans, wore, white, togas, as, symbols, of, citizenship, in, the, middle, ages, and, renaissance, a, white, unicorn, symbolized, chastity, and, a, white, lamb, sacrifice, and, purity, it, was, the, royal, color, of, the, kings, of, france, as, well, as, the, flag, of, monachist, france, from, 1815, to, 1830, and, of, the, monarchist, movement, that, opposed, the, bolsheviks, during, the, russian, civil, war, 1917, 1922, greek, temples, and, roman, temples, were, faced, with, white, marble, and, beginning, in, the, 18th, century, with, the, advent, of, neoclassical, architecture, white, became, the, most, common, color, of, new, churches, capitols, and, other, government, buildings, especially, in, the, united, states, it, was, also, widely, used, in, 20th, century, modern, architecture, as, a, symbol, of, modernity, and, simplicity, according, to, surveys, in, europe, and, the, united, states, white, is, the, color, most, often, associated, with, perfection, the, good, honesty, cleanliness, the, beginning, the, new, neutrality, and, exactitude, white, is, an, important, color, for, almost, all, world, religions, the, pope, the, head, of, the, roman, catholic, church, has, worn, white, since, 1566, as, a, symbol, of, purity, and, sacrifice, in, islam, and, in, the, shinto, religion, of, japan, it, is, worn, by, pilgrims, in, western, cultures, and, in, japan, white, is, the, most, common, color, for, wedding, dresses, symbolizing, purity, and, virginity, in, many, asian, cultures, white, is, also, the, color, of, mourning, the, word, white, continues, old, english, hw, t, ultimately, from, a,

words, depending, upon, brilliance, or, dullness, or, if, the, color, is, inert, or, dynamic, white, was, one, of, the, first, colors, used, in, art, the, lascaux, cave, in, france, contains, drawings, of, bulls, and, other, animals, drawn, by, paleolithic, artists, between, 18, 000, and, 17, 000, years, ago, paleolithic, artists, used, calcite, or, chalk, sometimes, as, a, background, sometimes, as, a, highlight, along, with, charcoal, and, red, and, yellow, ochre, in, their, vivid, cave, paintings, in, ancient, egypt, white, was, connected, with, the, goddess, isis, the, priests, and, priestesses, of, isis, dressed, only, in, white, linen, and, it, was, used, to, wrap, mummies, in, greece, and, other, ancient, civilizations, white, was, often, associated, with, mother, s, milk, in, greek, mythology, the, chief, god, zeus, was, nourished, at, the, breast, of, the, nymph, amalthea, in, the, talmud, milk, was, one, of, four, sacred, substances, along, with, wine, honey, and, the, rose, the, ancient, greeks, saw, the, world, in, terms, of, darkness, and, light, so, white, was, a, fundamental, color, according, to, pliny, the, elder, in, his, natural, history, apelles, 4th, century, bc, and, the, other, famous, painters, of, ancient, greece, used, only, four, colors, in, their, paintings, white, red, yellow, and, black, for, painting, the, greeks, used, the, highly, toxic, pigment, lead, white, made, by, a, long, and, laborious, process, a, plain, white, toga, known, as, a, toga, virilis, was, worn, for, ceremonial, occasions, by, all, roman, citizens, over, the, age, of, 14, 18, magistrates, and, certain, priests, wore, a, toga, praetexta, with, a, broad, purple, stripe, in, the, time, of, the, emperor, augustus, no, roman, man, was, allowed, to, appear, in, the, roman, forum, without, a, toga, the, ancient, romans, had, two, words, for, white, albus, a, plain, white, the, source, of, the, word, albino, and, candidus, a, brighter, white, a, man, who, wanted, public, office, in, rome, wore, a, white, toga, brightened, with, chalk, called, a, toga, candida, the, origin, of, the, word, candidate, the, latin, word, candere, meant, to, shine, to, be, bright, it, was, the, origin, of, the, words, candle, and, candid, in, ancient, rome, the, priestesses, of, the, goddess, vesta, dressed, in, white, linen, robes, a, white, palla, or, shawl, and, a, white, veil, they, protected, the, sacred, fire, and, the, penates, of, rome, white, symbolized, their, purity, loyalty, and, chastity, the, early, christian, church, adopted, the, roman, symbolism, of, white, as, the, color, of, purity, sacrifice, and, virtue, it, became, the, color, worn, by, priests, during, mass, the, color, worn, by, monks, of, the, cistercian, order, and, under, pope, pius, v, a, former, monk, of, the, dominican, order, it, became, the, official, color, worn, by, the, pope, himself, monks, of, the, order, of, saint, benedict, dressed, in, the, white, or, gray, of, natural, undyed, wool, but, later, changed, to, black, the, color, of, humility, and, penitence, postclassical, history, art, the, white, lamb, became, the, symbol, of, the, sacrifice, of, christ, on, behalf, of, mankind, john, the, baptist, described, christ, as, the, lamb, of, god, who, took, the, sins, of, the, world, upon, himself, the, white, lamb, was, the, center, of, one, of, the, most, famous, paintings, of, the, medieval, period, the, ghent, altarpiece, by, jan, van, eyck, white, was, also, the, symbolic, color, of, the, transfiguration, the, gospel, of, saint, mark, describes, jesus, clothing, in, this, event, as, shining, exceeding, white, as, snow, artists, such, as, fra, angelico, used, their, skill, to, capture, the, whiteness, of, his, garments, in, his, painting, of, the, transfiguration, at, the, convent, of, saint, mark, in, florence, fra, angelico, emphasized, the, white, garment, by, using, a, light, gold, background, placed, in, an, almond, shaped, halo, the, white, unicorn, was, a, common, subject, of, postclassical, history, manuscripts, paintings, and, tapestries, it, was, a, symbol, of, purity, chastity, and, grace, which, could, only, be, captured, by, a, virgin, it, was, often, portrayed, in, the, lap, of, the, virgin, mary, during, the, postclassical, history, painters, rarely, ever, mixed, colors, but, in, the, renaissance, the, influential, humanist, and, scholar, leon, battista, alberti, encouraged, artists, to, add, white, to, their, colors, to, make, them, lighter, brighter, and, to, add, hilaritas, or, gaiety, many, painters, followed, his, advice, and, the, palette, of, the, renaissance, was, considerably, brighter, until, the, 16th, century, white, was, commonly, worn, by, widows, as, a, color, of, mourning, the, widows, of, the, kings, of, france, wore, white, until, anne, of, brittany, in, the, 16th, century, a, white, tunic, was, also, worn, by, many, knights, along, with, a, red, cloak, which, showed, the, knights, were, willing, to, give, their, blood, for, the, king, or, church, white, was, the, dominant, color, of, architectural, interiors, in, the, baroque, period, and, especially, the, rococo, style, that, followed, it, in, the, 18th, century, church, interiors, were, designed, to, show, the, power, glory, and, wealth, of, the, church, they, seemed, to, be, alive, filled, with, curves, asymmetry, mirrors, gilding, statuary, and, reliefs, unified, by, white, white, was, also, a, fashionable, color, for, both, men, and, women, in, the, 18th, century, men, in, the, aristocracy, and, upper, classes, wore, powdered, white, wigs, and, white, stockings, and, women, wore, elaborate, embroidered, white, and, pastel, gowns, after, the, french, revolution, a, more, austere, white, blanc, cass, became, the, most, fashionable, color, in, women, s, costumes, which, were, modeled, after, the, outfits, of, ancient, greece, and, republican, rome, because, of, the, rather, revealing, design, of, these, dresses, the, women, wearing, them, were, called, les, merveilleuses, the, marvellous, by, french, men, of, that, era, the, empire, style, under, emperor, napol, on, i, was, modeled, after, the, more, conservative, outfits, of, ancient, imperial, rome, the, dresses, were, high, in, fashion, but, low, in, warmth, considering, the, more, severe, weather, conditions, of, northern, france, in, 1814, the, former, wife, of, napoleon, jos, phine, de, beauharnais, caught, pneumonia, and, died, after, taking, a, walk, in, the, cold, night, air, with, tsar, alexander, i, of, russia, white, was, the, universal, color, of, both, men, and, women, s, underwear, and, of, sheets, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, it, was, unthinkable, to, have, sheets, or, underwear, of, any, other, color, the, reason, was, simple, the, manner, of, washing, linen, in, boiling, water, caused, colors, to, fade, when, linen, was, worn, out, it, was, collected, and, turned, into, high, quality, paper, the, 19th, century, american, painter, james, mcneill, whistler, 1834, 1903, working, at, the, same, time, as, the, french, impressionists, created, a, series, of, paintings, with, musical, titles, where, he, used, color, to, create, moods, the, way, composers, used, music, his, painting, symphony, in, white, no, 1, the, white, girl, which, used, his, mistress, joanna, hiffernan, as, a, model, used, delicate, colors, to, portray, innocence, and, fragility, and, a, moment, of, uncertainty, the, white, movement, was, the, opposition, that, formed, against, the, bolsheviks, during, the, russian, civil, war, which, followed, the, russian, revolution, in, 1917, it, was, finally, defeated, by, the, bolsheviks, in, 1921, 22, and, many, of, its, members, emigrated, to, europe, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, lead, white, was, still, the, most, popular, pigment, but, between, 1916, and, 1918, chemical, companies, in, norway, and, the, united, states, began, to, produce, titanium, white, made, from, titanium, oxide, it, had, first, been, identified, in, the, 18th, century, by, the, german, chemist, martin, klaproth, who, also, discovered, uranium, it, had, twice, the, covering, power, of, lead, white, and, was, the, brightest, white, pigment, known, by, 1945, 80, percent, of, the, white, pigments, sold, were, titanium, white, the, absoluteness, of, white, appealed, to, modernist, painters, it, was, used, in, its, simplest, form, by, the, russian, suprematist, painter, kazimir, malevich, in, his, 1917, painting, the, white, square, the, companion, to, his, earlier, black, square, it, was, also, used, by, the, dutch, modernist, painter, piet, mondrian, his, most, famous, paintings, consisted, of, a, pure, white, canvas, with, grid, of, vertical, and, horizontal, black, lines, and, rectangles, of, primary, colors, black, and, white, also, appealed, to, modernist, architects, such, as, le, corbusier, 1887, 1965, he, said, a, house, was, a, machine, for, living, in, and, called, for, a, calm, and, powerful, architecture, built, of, reinforced, concrete, and, steel, without, any, ornament, or, frills, almost, all, the, buildings, of, contemporary, architect, richard, meier, such, as, his, museum, in, rome, to, house, the, ancient, roman, ara, pacis, or, altar, of, peace, are, stark, white, in, the, tradition, of, le, corbusier, light, is, perceived, by, the, human, visual, system, as, white, when, the, incoming, light, to, the, eye, stimulates, all, three, types, of, color, sensitive, cone, cells, in, the, eye, in, roughly, equal, amounts, materials, that, do, not, emit, light, themselves, appear, white, if, their, surfaces, reflect, back, most, of, the, light, that, strikes, them, in, a, diffuse, way, in, 1666, isaac, newton, demonstrated, that, white, light, was, composed, of, multiple, colors, by, passing, it, through, a, prism, to, break, it, up, into, components, then, using, a, second, prism, to, reassemble, them, before, newton, most, scientists, believed, that, white, was, the, fundamental, color, of, light, white, light, can, be, generated, by, the, sun, by, stars, or, by, earthbound, sources, such, as, fluorescent, lamps, white, leds, and, incandescent, bulbs, on, the, screen, of, a, color, television, or, computer, white, is, produced, by, mixing, the, primary, colors, of, light, red, green, and, blue, rgb, at, full, intensity, a, process, called, additive, mixing, see, image, above, white, light, can, be, fabricated, using, light, with, only, two, wavelengths, for, instance, by, mixing, light, from, a, red, and, cyan, laser, or, yellow, and, blue, lasers, this, light, will, however, have, very, few, practical, applications, since, color, rendering, of, objects, will, be, greatly, distorted, the, fact, that, light, sources, with, vastly, different, spectral, power, distributions, can, result, in, a, similar, sensory, experience, is, due, to, the, way, the, light, is, processed, by, the, visual, system, one, color, that, arises, from, two, different, spectral, power, distributions, is, called, a, metamerism, many, of, the, light, sources, that, emit, white, light, emit, light, at, almost, all, visible, wavelengths, sun, light, incandescent, lamps, of, various, color, temperatures, this, has, led, to, the, notion, that, white, light, can, be, defined, as, a, mixture, of, all, colors, or, all, visible, wavelengths, a, range, of, spectral, distributions, of, light, sources, can, be, perceived, as, white, there, is, no, single, unique, specification, of, white, light, for, example, when, buying, a, white, light, bulb, one, might, buy, one, labeled, 2700k, 6000k, etc, which, produce, light, having, very, different, spectral, distributions, and, yet, this, will, not, prevent, the, user, from, identifying, the, color, of, objects, that, those, light, bulbs, illuminate, color, vision, allows, us, to, distinguish, different, objects, by, their, color, in, order, to, do, so, color, constancy, can, keep, the, perceived, color, of, an, object, relatively, unchanged, when, the, illumination, changes, among, various, broad, whitish, spectral, distributions, of, light, the, same, principle, is, used, in, photography, and, cinematography, where, the, choice, of, white, point, determines, a, transformation, of, all, other, color, stimuli, changes, in, or, manipulation, of, the, white, point, can, be, used, to, explain, some, optical, illusions, such, as, the, dress, while, there, is, no, single, unique, specification, of, white, light, there, is, indeed, a, unique, specification, of, white, object, or, more, specifically, white, surface, a, perfectly, white, surface, diffusely, reflects, scatters, all, visible, light, that, strikes, it, without, absorbing, any, irrespective, of, the, light, s, wavelength, or, spectral, distribution, since, it, does, not, absorb, any, of, the, incident, light, white, is, the, lightest, possible, color, if, the, reflection, is, not, diffuse, but, rather, specular, this, describes, a, mirror, rather, than, a, white, surface, reflection, of, 100, of, incident, light, at, all, wavelengths, is, a, form, of, uniform, reflectance, so, white, is, an, achromatic, color, meaning, a, color, without, hue, the, color, stimulus, produced, by, the, perfect, diffuser, is, usually, considered, to, be, an, achromatic, stimulus, for, all, illuminants, except, for, those, whose, light, sources, appear, to, be, highly, chromatic, color, constancy, is, achieved, by, chromatic, adaptation, the, international, commission, on, illumination, defines, white, adapted, as, a, color, stimulus, that, an, observer, who, is, adapted, to, the, viewing, environment, would, judge, to, be, perfectly, achromatic, and, to, have, a, luminance, factor, of, unity, the, color, stimulus, that, is, considered, to, be, the, adapted, white, may, be, different, at, different, locations, within, a, scene, beaches, with, sand, containing, high, amounts, of, quartz, or, eroded, limestone, also, appear, white, since, quartz, and, limestone, reflect, or, scatter, sunlight, rather, than, absorbing, it, tropical, white, sand, beaches, may, also, have, a, high, quantity, of, white, calcium, carbonate, from, tiny, bits, of, seashells, ground, to, fine, sand, by, the, action, of, the, waves, the, white, cliffs, of, dover, take, their, white, color, from, the, large, amount, of, chalk, made, of, limestone, which, they, contain, which, reflects, the, sunlight, snow, is, a, mixture, of, air, and, tiny, ice, crystals, when, white, sunlight, enters, snow, very, little, of, the, spectrum, is, absorbed, almost, all, of, the, light, is, reflected, or, scattered, by, the, air, and, water, molecules, so, the, snow, appears, to, be, the, color, of, sunlight, white, sometimes, the, light, bounces, around, inside, the, ice, crystals, before, being, scattered, making, the, snow, seem, to, sparkle, in, the, case, of, glaciers, the, ice, is, more, tightly, pressed, together, and, contains, little, air, as, sunlight, enters, the, ice, more, light, of, the, red, spectrum, is, absorbed, so, the, light, scattered, will, be, bluish, clouds, are, white, for, the, same, reason, as, ice, they, are, composed, of, water, droplets, or, ice, crystals, mixed, with, air, very, little, light, that, strikes, them, is, absorbed, and, most, of, the, light, is, scattered, appearing, to, the, eye, as, white, shadows, of, other, clouds, above, can, make, clouds, look, gray, and, some, clouds, have, their, own, shadow, on, the, bottom, of, the, cloud, many, mountains, with, winter, or, year, round, snow, cover, are, named, accordingly, mauna, kea, means, white, mountain, in, hawaiian, mont, blanc, means, white, mountain, in, french, changbai, mountains, literally, meaning, perpetually, white, mountains, marks, the, border, between, china, and, korea, chalk, is, a, type, of, limestone, made, of, the, mineral, calcite, or, calcium, carbonate, it, was, originally, deposited, under, the, sea, as, the, scales, or, plates, of, tiny, micro, organisms, called, coccolithophore, it, was, the, first, white, pigment, used, by, prehistoric, artists, in, cave, paintings, the, chalk, used, on, blackboards, today, is, usually, made, of, gypsum, or, calcium, sulphate, a, powder, pressed, into, sticks, bianco, di, san, giovanni, is, a, pigment, used, in, the, renaissance, which, was, described, by, the, painter, cennino, cennini, in, the, 15th, century, it, is, similar, to, chalk, made, of, calcium, carbonate, with, calcium, hydroxide, it, was, made, of, dried, lime, which, was, made, into, a, powder, then, soaked, in, water, for, eight, days, with, the, water, changed, each, day, it, was, then, made, into, cakes, and, dried, in, the, sun, lead, white, was, being, produced, during, the, 4th, century, bc, the, process, is, described, is, pliny, the, elder, vitruvius, and, the, ancient, greek, author, theophrastus, pieces, of, lead, were, put, into, clay, pots, which, had, a, separate, compartment, filled, with, vinegar, the, pots, in, turn, were, piled, on, shelves, close, to, cow, dung, the, combined, fumes, of, the, vinegar, and, the, cow, dung, caused, the, lead, to, corrode, into, lead, carbonate, it, was, a, slow, process, which, could, take, a, month, or, more, it, made, an, excellent, white, and, was, used, by, artists, for, centuries, but, it, was, also, toxic, it, was, replaced, in, the, 19th, century, by, zinc, white, and, titanium, white, titanium, white, is, the, most, popular, white, for, artists, today, it, is, the, brightest, available, white, pigment, and, has, twice, the, coverage, of, lead, white, it, first, became, commercially, available, in, 1921, it, is, made, out, of, titanium, dioxide, from, the, minerals, brookite, anatase, rutile, or, ilmenite, currently, the, major, source, because, of, its, brilliant, whiteness, it, is, used, as, a, colorant, for, most, toothpaste, and, sunscreen, zinc, white, is, made, from, zinc, oxide, it, is, similar, to, but, not, as, opaque, as, titanium, white, it, is, added, to, some, foods, to, enrich, them, with, zinc, an, important, nutrient, chinese, white, is, a, variety, of, zinc, white, made, for, artists, some, materials, can, be, made, to, look, whiter, than, white, this, is, achieved, using, optical, brightener, agents, oba, these, are, chemical, compounds, that, absorb, light, in, the, ultraviolet, and, violet, region, usually, 340, 370, nm, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, and, re, emit, light, in, the, blue, region, typically, 420, 470, nm, obas, are, often, used, in, paper, and, clothing, to, create, an, impression, of, very, bright, white, this, is, due, to, the, fact, that, the, materials, actually, send, out, more, visible, light, than, they, receive, bleaching, is, a, process, for, whitening, fabrics, which, has, been, practiced, for, thousands, of, years, sometimes, it, was, simply, a, matter, of, leaving, the, fabric, in, the, sun, to, be, faded, by, the, bright, light, in, the, 18th, century, several, scientists, developed, varieties, of, chlorine, bleach, including, sodium, hypochlorite, and, calcium, hypochlorite, bleaching, powder, bleaching, agents, that, do, not, contain, chlorine, most, often, are, based, on, peroxides, such, as, hydrogen, peroxide, sodium, percarbonate, and, sodium, perborate, while, most, bleaches, are, oxidizing, agents, a, fewer, number, are, reducing, agents, such, as, sodium, dithionite, bleaches, attack, the, chromophores, the, part, of, a, molecule, which, absorbs, light, and, causes, fabrics, to, have, different, colors, an, oxidizing, bleach, works, by, breaking, the, chemical, bonds, that, make, up, the, chromophore, this, changes, the, molecule, into, a, different, substance, that, either, does, not, contain, a, chromophore, or, contains, a, chromophore, that, does, not, absorb, visible, light, a, reducing, bleach, works, by, converting, double, bonds, in, the, chromophore, into, single, bonds, this, eliminates, the, ability, of, the, chromophore, to, absorb, visible, light, sunlight, acts, as, a, bleach, through, a, similar, process, high, energy, photons, of, light, often, in, the, violet, or, ultraviolet, range, can, disrupt, the, bonds, in, the, chromophore, rendering, the, resulting, substance, colorless, some, detergents, go, one, step, further, they, contain, fluorescent, chemicals, which, glow, making, the, fabric, look, literally, whiter, than, white, a, white, dwarf, is, a, stellar, remnant, composed, mostly, of, electron, degenerate, matter, they, are, very, dense, a, white, dwarf, s, mass, is, comparable, to, that, of, the, sun, and, its, volume, is, comparable, to, that, of, the, earth, its, faint, luminosity, comes, from, the, emission, of, stored, thermal, energy, a, white, dwarf, is, very, hot, when, it, is, formed, but, since, it, has, no, source, of, energy, it, will, gradually, radiate, away, its, energy, and, cool, down, this, means, that, its, radiation, which, initially, has, a, high, color, temperature, will, lessen, and, redden, with, time, over, a, very, long, time, a, white, dwarf, will, cool, to, temperatures, at, which, it, will, no, longer, emit, significant, heat, or, light, and, it, will, become, a, cold, black, dwarf, however, since, no, white, dwarf, can, be, older, than, the, age, of, the, universe, approximately, 13, 8, billion, years, even, the, oldest, white, dwarfs, still, radiate, at, temperatures, of, a, few, thousand, kelvins, and, no, black, dwarfs, are, thought, to, exist, yet, an, a, type, main, sequence, star, a, v, or, a, dwarf, star, is, a, main, sequence, hydrogen, burning, star, of, spectral, type, a, and, luminosity, class, v, these, stars, have, spectra, which, are, defined, by, strong, hydrogen, balmer, absorption, lines, they, have, masses, from, 1, 4, to, 2, 1, times, the, mass, of,
