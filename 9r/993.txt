in, physics, physical, chemistry, and, engineering, fluid, dynamics, is, a, subdiscipline, of, fluid, mechanics, that, describes, the, flow, of, fluids, liquids, and, gases, it, has, several, subdisciplines, including, aerodynamics, the, study, of, air, and, other, gases, in, motion, and, hydrodynamics, the, study, of, liquids, in, motion, fluid, dynamics, has, a, wide, range, of, applications, including, calculating, forces, and, moments, on, aircraft, determining, the, mass, flow, rate, of, petroleum, through, pipelines, predicting, weather, patterns, understanding, nebulae, in, interstellar, space, and, modelling, fission, weapon, detonation, fluid, dynamics, offers, a, systematic, structure, which, underlies, these, practical, disciplines, that, embraces, empirical, and, semi, empirical, laws, derived, from, flow, measurement, and, used, to, solve, practical, problems, the, solution, to, a, fluid, dynamics, problem, typically, involves, the, calculation, of, various, properties, of, the, fluid, such, as, flow, velocity, pressure, density, and, temperature, as, functions, of, space, and, time, before, the, twentieth, century, hydrodynamics, was, synonymous, with, fluid, dynamics, this, is, still, reflected, in, names, of, some, fluid, dynamics, topics, like, magnetohydrodynamics, and, hydrodynamic, stability, both, of, which, can, also, be, applied, to, gases, the, foundational, axioms, of, fluid, dynamics, are, the, conservation, laws, specifically, conservation, of, mass, conservation, of, linear, momentum, and, conservation, of, energy, also, known, as, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, these, are, based, on, classical, mechanics, and, are, modified, in, quantum, mechanics, and, general, relativity, they, are, expressed, using, the, reynolds, transport, theorem, in, addition, to, the, above, fluids, are, assumed, to, obey, the, continuum, assumption, at, small, scale, all, fluids, are, composed, of, molecules, that, collide, with, one, another, and, solid, objects, however, the, continuum, assumption, assumes, that, fluids, are, continuous, rather, than, discrete, consequently, it, is, assumed, that, properties, such, as, density, pressure, temperature, and, flow, velocity, are, well, defined, at, infinitesimally, small, points, in, space, and, vary, continuously, from, one, point, to, another, the, fact, that, the, fluid, is, made, up, of, discrete, molecules, is, ignored, for, fluids, that, are, sufficiently, dense, to, be, a, continuum, do, not, contain, ionized, species, and, have, flow, velocities, that, are, small, in, relation, to, the, speed, of, light, the, momentum, equations, for, newtonian, fluids, are, the, navier, stokes, equations, which, is, a, non, linear, set, of, differential, equations, that, describes, the, flow, of, a, fluid, whose, stress, depends, linearly, on, flow, velocity, gradients, and, pressure, the, unsimplified, equations, do, not, have, a, general, closed, form, solution, so, they, are, primarily, of, use, in, computational, fluid, dynamics, the, equations, can, be, simplified, in, several, ways, all, of, which, make, them, easier, to, solve, some, of, the, simplifications, allow, some, simple, fluid, dynamics, problems, to, be, solved, in, closed, form, in, addition, to, the, mass, momentum, and, energy, conservation, equations, a, thermodynamic, equation, of, state, that, gives, the, pressure, as, a, function, of, other, thermodynamic, variables, is, required, to, completely, describe, the, problem, an, example, of, this, would, be, the, perfect, gas, equation, of, state, where, p, is, pressure, is, density, and, t, is, the, absolute, temperature, while, r, u, is, the, gas, constant, and, m, is, molar, mass, for, a, particular, gas, a, constitutive, relation, may, also, be, useful, three, conservation, laws, are, used, to, solve, fluid, dynamics, problems, and, may, be, written, in, integral, or, differential, form, the, conservation, laws, may, be, applied, to, a, region, of, the, flow, called, a, control, volume, a, control, volume, is, a, discrete, volume, in, space, through, which, fluid, is, assumed, to, flow, the, integral, formulations, of, the, conservation, laws, are, used, to, describe, the, change, of, mass, momentum, or, energy, within, the, control, volume, differential, formulations, of, the, conservation, laws, apply, stokes, theorem, to, yield, an, expression, that, may, be, interpreted, as, the, integral, form, of, the, law, applied, to, an, infinitesimally, small, volume, at, a, point, within, the, flow, in, the, above, integral, formulation, of, this, equation, the, term, on, the, left, is, the, net, change, of, momentum, within, the, volume, the, first, term, on, the, right, is, the, net, rate, at, which, momentum, is, convected, into, the, volume, the, second, term, on, the, right, is, the, force, due, to, pressure, on, the, volume, s, surfaces, the, first, two, terms, on, the, right, are, negated, since, momentum, entering, the, system, is, accounted, as, positive, and, the, normal, is, opposite, the, direction, of, the, velocity, u, and, pressure, forces, the, third, term, on, the, right, is, the, net, acceleration, of, the, mass, within, the, volume, due, to, any, body, forces, here, represented, by, f, body, surface, forces, such, as, viscous, forces, are, represented, by, f, surf, the, net, force, due, to, shear, forces, acting, on, the, volume, surface, the, momentum, balance, can, also, be, written, for, a, moving, control, volume, the, following, is, the, differential, form, of, the, momentum, conservation, equation, here, the, volume, is, reduced, to, an, infinitesimally, small, point, and, both, surface, and, body, forces, are, accounted, for, in, one, total, force, f, for, example, f, may, be, expanded, into, an, expression, for, the, frictional, and, gravitational, forces, acting, at, a, point, in, a, flow, all, fluids, are, compressible, to, an, extent, that, is, changes, in, pressure, or, temperature, cause, changes, in, density, however, in, many, situations, the, changes, in, pressure, and, temperature, are, sufficiently, small, that, the, changes, in, density, are, negligible, in, this, case, the, flow, can, be, modelled, as, an, incompressible, flow, otherwise, the, more, general, compressible, flow, equations, must, be, used, mathematically, incompressibility, is, expressed, by, saying, that, the, density, of, a, fluid, parcel, does, not, change, as, it, moves, in, the, flow, field, that, is, where, d, d, t, is, the, material, derivative, which, is, the, sum, of, local, and, convective, derivatives, this, additional, constraint, simplifies, the, governing, equations, especially, in, the, case, when, the, fluid, has, a, uniform, density, for, flow, of, gases, to, determine, whether, to, use, compressible, or, incompressible, fluid, dynamics, the, mach, number, of, the, flow, is, evaluated, as, a, rough, guide, compressible, effects, can, be, ignored, at, mach, numbers, below, approximately, 0, 3, for, liquids, whether, the, incompressible, assumption, is, valid, depends, on, the, fluid, properties, specifically, the, critical, pressure, and, temperature, of, the, fluid, and, the, flow, conditions, how, close, to, the, critical, pressure, the, actual, flow, pressure, becomes, acoustic, problems, always, require, allowing, compressibility, since, sound, waves, are, compression, waves, involving, changes, in, pressure, and, density, of, the, medium, through, which, they, propagate, all, fluids, except, superfluids, are, viscous, meaning, that, they, exert, some, resistance, to, deformation, neighbouring, parcels, of, fluid, moving, at, different, velocities, exert, viscous, forces, on, each, other, the, velocity, gradient, is, referred, to, as, a, strain, rate, it, has, dimensions, t, 1, isaac, newton, showed, that, for, many, familiar, fluids, such, as, water, and, air, the, stress, due, to, these, viscous, forces, is, linearly, related, to, the, strain, rate, such, fluids, are, called, newtonian, fluids, the, coefficient, of, proportionality, is, called, the, fluid, s, viscosity, for, newtonian, fluids, it, is, a, fluid, property, that, is, independent, of, the, strain, rate, non, newtonian, fluids, have, a, more, complicated, non, linear, stress, strain, behaviour, the, sub, discipline, of, rheology, describes, the, stress, strain, behaviours, of, such, fluids, which, include, emulsions, and, slurries, some, viscoelastic, materials, such, as, blood, and, some, polymers, and, sticky, liquids, such, as, latex, honey, and, lubricants, the, dynamic, of, fluid, parcels, is, described, with, the, help, of, newton, s, second, law, an, accelerating, parcel, of, fluid, is, subject, to, inertial, effects, the, reynolds, number, is, a, dimensionless, quantity, which, characterises, the, magnitude, of, inertial, effects, compared, to, the, magnitude, of, viscous, effects, a, low, reynolds, number, re, 1, indicates, that, viscous, forces, are, very, strong, compared, to, inertial, forces, in, such, cases, inertial, forces, are, sometimes, neglected, this, flow, regime, is, called, stokes, or, creeping, flow, in, contrast, high, reynolds, numbers, re, 1, indicate, that, the, inertial, effects, have, more, effect, on, the, velocity, field, than, the, viscous, friction, effects, in, high, reynolds, number, flows, the, flow, is, often, modeled, as, an, inviscid, flow, an, approximation, in, which, viscosity, is, completely, neglected, eliminating, viscosity, allows, the, navier, stokes, equations, to, be, simplified, into, the, euler, equations, the, integration, of, the, euler, equations, along, a, streamline, in, an, inviscid, flow, yields, bernoulli, s, equation, when, in, addition, to, being, inviscid, the, flow, is, irrotational, everywhere, bernoulli, s, equation, can, completely, describe, the, flow, everywhere, such, flows, are, called, potential, flows, because, the, velocity, field, may, be, expressed, as, the, gradient, of, a, potential, energy, expression, this, idea, can, work, fairly, well, when, the, reynolds, number, is, high, however, problems, such, as, those, involving, solid, boundaries, may, require, that, the, viscosity, be, included, viscosity, cannot, be, neglected, near, solid, boundaries, because, the, no, slip, condition, generates, a, thin, region, of, large, strain, rate, the, boundary, layer, in, which, viscosity, effects, dominate, and, which, thus, generates, vorticity, therefore, to, calculate, net, forces, on, bodies, such, as, wings, viscous, flow, equations, must, be, used, inviscid, flow, theory, fails, to, predict, drag, forces, a, limitation, known, as, the, d, alembert, s, paradox, a, commonly, used, model, especially, in, computational, fluid, dynamics, is, to, use, two, flow, models, the, euler, equations, away, from, the, body, and, boundary, layer, equations, in, a, region, close, to, the, body, the, two, solutions, can, then, be, matched, with, each, other, using, the, method, of, matched, asymptotic, expansions, a, flow, that, is, not, a, function, of, time, is, called, steady, flow, steady, state, flow, refers, to, the, condition, where, the, fluid, properties, at, a, point, in, the, system, do, not, change, over, time, time, dependent, flow, is, known, as, unsteady, also, called, transient, whether, a, particular, flow, is, steady, or, unsteady, can, depend, on, the, chosen, frame, of, reference, for, instance, laminar, flow, over, a, sphere, is, steady, in, the, frame, of, reference, that, is, stationary, with, respect, to, the, sphere, in, a, frame, of, reference, that, is, stationary, with, respect, to, a, background, flow, the, flow, is, unsteady, turbulent, flows, are, unsteady, by, definition, a, turbulent, flow, can, however, be, statistically, stationary, the, random, velocity, field, u, x, t, is, statistically, stationary, if, all, statistics, are, invariant, under, a, shift, in, time, 75, this, roughly, means, that, all, statistical, properties, are, constant, in, time, often, the, mean, field, is, the, object, of, interest, and, this, is, constant, too, in, a, statistically, stationary, flow, steady, flows, are, often, more, tractable, than, otherwise, similar, unsteady, flows, the, governing, equations, of, a, steady, problem, have, one, dimension, fewer, time, than, the, governing, equations, of, the, same, problem, without, taking, advantage, of, the, steadiness, of, the, flow, field, turbulence, is, flow, characterized, by, recirculation, eddies, and, apparent, randomness, flow, in, which, turbulence, is, not, exhibited, is, called, laminar, the, presence, of, eddies, or, recirculation, alone, does, not, necessarily, indicate, turbulent, flow, these, phenomena, may, be, present, in, laminar, flow, as, well, mathematically, turbulent, flow, is, often, represented, via, a, reynolds, decomposition, in, which, the, flow, is, broken, down, into, the, sum, of, an, average, component, and, a, perturbation, component, it, is, believed, that, turbulent, flows, can, be, described, well, through, the, use, of, the, navier, stokes, equations, direct, numerical, simulation, dns, based, on, the, navier, stokes, equations, makes, it, possible, to, simulate, turbulent, flows, at, moderate, reynolds, numbers, restrictions, depend, on, the, power, of, the, computer, used, and, the, efficiency, of, the, solution, algorithm, the, results, of, dns, have, been, found, to, agree, well, with, experimental, data, for, some, flows, most, flows, of, interest, have, reynolds, numbers, much, too, high, for, dns, to, be, a, viable, option, 344, given, the, state, of, computational, power, for, the, next, few, decades, any, flight, vehicle, large, enough, to, carry, a, human, l, 3, m, moving, faster, than, 20, m, s, 72, km, h, 45, mph, is, well, beyond, the, limit, of, dns, simulation, re, 4, million, transport, aircraft, wings, such, as, on, an, airbus, a300, or, boeing, 747, have, reynolds, numbers, of, 40, million, based, on, the, wing, chord, dimension, solving, these, real, life, flow, problems, requires, turbulence, models, for, the, foreseeable, future, reynolds, averaged, navier, stokes, equations, rans, combined, with, turbulence, modelling, provides, a, model, of, the, effects, of, the, turbulent, flow, such, a, modelling, mainly, provides, the, additional, momentum, transfer, by, the, reynolds, stresses, although, the, turbulence, also, enhances, the, heat, and, mass, transfer, another, promising, methodology, is, large, eddy, simulation, les, especially, in, the, form, of, detached, eddy, simulation, des, a, combination, of, les, and, rans, turbulence, modelling, there, are, a, large, number, of, other, possible, approximations, to, fluid, dynamic, problems, some, of, the, more, commonly, used, are, listed, below, while, many, flows, such, as, flow, of, water, through, a, pipe, occur, at, low, mach, numbers, subsonic, flows, many, flows, of, practical, interest, in, aerodynamics, or, in, turbomachines, occur, at, high, fractions, of, m, 1, transonic, flows, or, in, excess, of, it, supersonic, or, even, hypersonic, flows, new, phenomena, occur, at, these, regimes, such, as, instabilities, in, transonic, flow, shock, waves, for, supersonic, flow, or, non, equilibrium, chemical, behaviour, due, to, ionization, in, hypersonic, flows, in, practice, each, of, those, flow, regimes, is, treated, separately, reactive, flows, are, flows, that, are, chemically, reactive, which, finds, its, applications, in, many, areas, including, combustion, ic, engine, propulsion, devices, rockets, jet, engines, and, so, on, detonations, fire, and, safety, hazards, and, astrophysics, in, addition, to, conservation, of, mass, momentum, and, energy, conservation, of, individual, species, for, example, mass, fraction, of, methane, in, methane, combustion, need, to, be, derived, where, the, production, depletion, rate, of, any, species, are, obtained, by, simultaneously, solving, the, equations, of, chemical, kinetics, magnetohydrodynamics, is, the, multidisciplinary, study, of, the, flow, of, electrically, conducting, fluids, in, electromagnetic, fields, examples, of, such, fluids, include, plasmas, liquid, metals, and, salt, water, the, fluid, flow, equations, are, solved, simultaneously, with, maxwell, s, equations, of, electromagnetism, relativistic, fluid, dynamics, studies, the, macroscopic, and, microscopic, fluid, motion, at, large, velocities, comparable, to, the, velocity, of, light, this, branch, of, fluid, dynamics, accounts, for, the, relativistic, effects, both, from, the, special, theory, of, relativity, and, the, general, theory, of, relativity, the, governing, equations, are, derived, in, riemannian, geometry, for, minkowski, spacetime, this, branch, of, fluid, dynamics, augments, the, standard, hydrodynamic, equations, with, stochastic, fluxes, that, model, thermal, fluctuations, as, formulated, by, landau, and, lifshitz, a, white, noise, contribution, obtained, from, the, fluctuation, dissipation, theorem, of, statistical, mechanics, is, added, to, the, viscous, stress, tensor, and, heat, flux, the, concept, of, pressure, is, central, to, the, study, of, both, fluid, statics, and, fluid, dynamics, a, pressure, can, be, identified, for, every, point, in, a, body, of, fluid, regardless, of, whether, the, fluid, is, in, motion, or, not, pressure, can, be, measured, using, an, aneroid, bourdon, tube, mercury, column, or, various, other, methods, some, of, the, terminology, that, is, necessary, in, the, study, of, fluid, dynamics, is, not, found, in, other, similar, areas, of, study, in, particular, some, of, the, terminology, used, in, fluid, dynamics, is, not, used, in, fluid, statics, dimensionless, numbers, or, characteristic, numbers, have, an, important, role, in, analyzing, the, behavior, of, fluids, and, their, flow, as, well, as, in, other, transport, phenomena, they, include, the, reynolds, and, the, mach, numbers, which, describe, as, ratios, the, relative, magnitude, of, fluid, and, physical, system, characteristics, such, as, density, viscosity, speed, of, sound, and, flow, speed, the, concepts, of, total, pressure, and, dynamic, pressure, arise, from, bernoulli, s, equation, and, are, significant, in, the, study, of, all, fluid, flows, these, two, pressures, are, not, pressures, in, the, usual, sense, they, cannot, be, measured, using, an, aneroid, bourdon, tube, or, mercury, column, to, avoid, potential, ambiguity, when, referring, to, pressure, in, fluid, dynamics, many, authors, use, the, term, static, pressure, to, distinguish, it, from, total, pressure, and, dynamic, pressure, static, pressure, is, identical, to, pressure, and, can, be, identified, for, every, point, in, a, fluid, flow, field, a, point, in, a, fluid, flow, where, the, flow, has, come, to, rest, that, is, to, say, speed, is, equal, to, zero, adjacent, to, some, solid, body, immersed, in, the, fluid, flow, is, of, special, significance, it, is, of, such, importance, that, it, is, given, a, special, name, a, stagnation, point, the, static, pressure, at, the, stagnation, point, is, of, special, significance, and, is, given, its, own, name, stagnation, pressure, in, incompressible, flows, the, stagnation, pressure, at, a, stagnation, point, is, equal, to, the, total, pressure, throughout, the, flow, field, in, a, compressible, fluid, it, is, convenient, to, define, the, total, conditions, also, called, stagnation, conditions, for, all, thermodynamic, state, properties, such, as, total, temperature, total, enthalpy, total, speed, of, sound, these, total, flow, conditions, are, a, function, of, the, fluid, velocity, and, have, different, values, in, frames, of, reference, with, different, motion, to, avoid, potential, ambiguity, when, referring, to, the, properties, of, the, fluid, associated, with, the, state, of, the, fluid, rather, than, its, motion, the, prefix, static, is, commonly, used, such, as, static, temperature, and, static, enthalpy, where, there, is, no, prefix, the, fluid, property, is, the, static, condition, so, density, and, static, density, mean, the, same, thing, the, static, conditions, are, independent, of, the, frame, of, reference, because, the, total, flow, conditions, are, defined, by, isentropically, bringing, the, fluid, to, rest, there, is, no, need, to, distinguish, between, total, entropy, and, static, entropy, as, they, are, always, equal, by, definition, as, such, entropy, is, most, commonly, referred, to, as, simply, entropy
