fluorescence, is, one, of, two, kinds, of, emission, of, light, by, a, substance, that, has, absorbed, light, or, other, electromagnetic, radiation, fluorescence, involves, no, change, in, electron, spin, multiplicity, and, generally, it, immediately, follows, absorption, phosphorescence, involves, spin, change, and, is, delayed, thus, fluorescent, materials, generally, cease, to, glow, nearly, immediately, when, the, radiation, source, stops, while, phosphorescent, materials, continue, to, emit, light, for, some, time, after, fluorescence, is, a, form, of, luminescence, in, most, cases, the, emitted, light, has, a, longer, wavelength, and, therefore, a, lower, photon, energy, than, the, absorbed, radiation, a, perceptible, example, of, fluorescence, occurs, when, the, absorbed, radiation, is, in, the, ultraviolet, region, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, invisible, to, the, human, eye, while, the, emitted, light, is, in, the, visible, region, this, gives, the, fluorescent, substance, a, distinct, color, that, can, only, be, seen, when, the, substance, has, been, exposed, to, uv, light, fluorescence, has, many, practical, applications, including, mineralogy, gemology, medicine, chemical, sensors, fluorescence, spectroscopy, fluorescent, labelling, dyes, biological, detectors, cosmic, ray, detection, vacuum, fluorescent, displays, and, cathode, ray, tubes, its, most, common, everyday, application, is, in, gas, discharge, fluorescent, lamps, and, led, lamps, in, which, fluorescent, coatings, convert, uv, or, blue, light, into, longer, wavelengths, resulting, in, white, light, which, can, even, appear, indistinguishable, from, that, of, the, traditional, but, energy, inefficient, incandescent, lamp, fluorescence, also, occurs, frequently, in, nature, in, some, minerals, and, in, many, biological, forms, across, all, kingdoms, of, life, the, latter, may, be, referred, to, as, biofluorescence, indicating, that, the, fluorophore, is, part, of, or, is, extracted, from, a, living, organism, rather, than, an, inorganic, dye, or, stain, but, since, fluorescence, is, due, to, a, specific, chemical, which, can, also, be, synthesized, artificially, in, most, cases, it, is, sufficient, to, describe, the, substance, itself, as, fluorescent, fluorescence, was, observed, long, before, it, was, named, and, understood, an, early, observation, of, fluorescence, was, known, to, the, aztecs, and, described, in, 1560, by, bernardino, de, sahag, n, and, in, 1565, by, nicol, s, monardes, in, the, infusion, known, as, lignum, nephriticum, latin, for, kidney, wood, it, was, derived, from, the, wood, of, two, tree, species, pterocarpus, indicus, and, eysenhardtia, polystachya, the, chemical, compound, responsible, for, this, fluorescence, is, matlaline, which, is, the, oxidation, product, of, one, of, the, flavonoids, found, in, this, wood, in, 1819, e, d, clarke, and, in, 1822, ren, just, ha, y, described, some, varieties, of, fluorites, that, had, a, different, color, depending, if, the, light, was, reflected, or, apparently, transmitted, ha, y, s, incorrectly, viewed, the, effect, as, light, scattering, similar, to, opalescence, fig, 5, in, 1833, sir, david, brewster, described, a, similar, effect, in, chlorophyll, which, he, also, considered, a, form, of, opalescence, sir, john, herschel, studied, quinine, in, 1845, and, came, to, a, different, incorrect, conclusion, in, 1842, a, e, becquerel, observed, that, calcium, sulfide, emits, light, after, being, exposed, to, solar, ultraviolet, making, him, the, first, to, state, that, the, emitted, light, is, of, longer, wavelength, than, the, incident, light, while, his, observation, of, photoluminescence, was, similar, to, that, described, 10, years, later, by, stokes, who, observed, a, fluorescence, of, a, solution, of, quinine, the, phenomenon, that, becquerel, described, with, calcium, sulfide, is, now, called, phosphorescence, in, his, 1852, paper, on, the, refrangibility, wavelength, change, of, light, george, gabriel, stokes, described, the, ability, of, fluorspar, uranium, glass, and, many, other, substances, to, change, invisible, light, beyond, the, violet, end, of, the, visible, spectrum, into, visible, light, he, named, this, phenomenon, fluorescence, neither, becquerel, nor, stokes, understood, one, key, aspect, of, photoluminescence, the, critical, difference, from, incandescence, the, emission, of, light, by, heated, material, to, distinguish, it, from, incandescence, in, the, late, 1800s, gustav, wiedemann, proposed, the, term, luminescence, to, designate, any, emission, of, light, more, intense, than, expected, from, the, source, s, temperature, advances, in, spectroscopy, and, quantum, electronics, between, the, 1950s, and, 1970s, provided, a, way, to, distinguish, between, the, three, different, mechanisms, that, produce, the, light, as, well, as, narrowing, down, the, typical, timescales, those, mechanisms, take, to, decay, after, absorption, in, modern, science, this, distinction, became, important, because, some, items, such, as, lasers, required, the, fastest, decay, times, which, typically, occur, in, the, nanosecond, billionth, of, a, second, range, in, physics, this, first, mechanism, was, termed, fluorescence, or, singlet, emission, and, is, common, in, many, laser, mediums, such, as, ruby, other, fluorescent, materials, were, discovered, to, have, much, longer, decay, times, because, some, of, the, atoms, would, change, their, spin, to, a, triplet, state, thus, would, glow, brightly, with, fluorescence, under, excitation, but, produce, a, dimmer, afterglow, for, a, short, time, after, the, excitation, was, removed, which, became, labeled, phosphorescence, or, triplet, phosphorescence, the, typical, decay, times, ranged, from, a, few, microseconds, to, one, second, which, are, still, fast, enough, by, human, eye, standards, to, be, colloquially, referred, to, as, fluorescent, common, examples, include, fluorescent, lamps, organic, dyes, and, even, fluorspar, longer, emitters, commonly, referred, to, as, glow, in, the, dark, substances, ranged, from, one, second, to, many, hours, and, this, mechanism, was, called, persistent, phosphorescence, or, persistent, luminescence, to, distinguish, it, from, the, other, two, mechanisms, 1, 25, fluorescence, occurs, when, an, excited, molecule, atom, or, nanostructure, relaxes, to, a, lower, energy, state, usually, the, ground, state, through, emission, of, a, photon, without, a, change, in, electron, spin, when, the, initial, and, final, states, have, different, multiplicity, spin, the, phenomenon, is, termed, phosphorescence, the, ground, state, of, most, molecules, is, a, singlet, state, denoted, as, s, 0, a, notable, exception, is, molecular, oxygen, which, has, a, triplet, ground, state, absorption, of, a, photon, of, energy, h, e, x, displaystyle, h, nu, ex, results, in, an, excited, state, of, the, same, multiplicity, spin, of, the, ground, state, usually, a, singlet, s, n, with, n, 0, in, solution, states, with, n, 1, relax, rapidly, to, the, lowest, vibrational, level, of, the, first, excited, state, s, 1, by, transferring, energy, to, the, solvent, molecules, through, non, radiative, processes, including, internal, conversion, followed, by, vibrational, relaxation, in, which, the, energy, is, dissipated, as, heat, therefore, most, commonly, fluorescence, occurs, from, the, first, singlet, excited, state, s, 1, fluorescence, is, the, emission, of, a, photon, accompanying, the, relaxation, of, the, excited, state, to, the, ground, state, fluorescence, photons, are, lower, in, energy, h, e, m, displaystyle, h, nu, em, compared, to, the, energy, of, the, photons, used, to, generate, the, excited, state, h, e, x, displaystyle, h, nu, ex, in, each, case, the, photon, energy, e, displaystyle, e, is, proportional, to, its, frequency, displaystyle, nu, according, to, e, h, displaystyle, e, h, nu, where, h, displaystyle, h, is, the, planck, constant, the, excited, state, s, 1, can, relax, by, other, mechanisms, that, do, not, involve, the, emission, of, light, these, processes, called, non, radiative, processes, compete, with, fluorescence, emission, and, decrease, its, efficiency, examples, include, internal, conversion, intersystem, crossing, to, the, triplet, state, and, energy, transfer, to, another, molecule, an, example, of, energy, transfer, is, f, rster, resonance, energy, transfer, relaxation, from, an, excited, state, can, also, occur, through, collisional, quenching, a, process, where, a, molecule, the, quencher, collides, with, the, fluorescent, molecule, during, its, excited, state, lifetime, molecular, oxygen, o, 2, is, an, extremely, efficient, quencher, of, fluorescence, just, because, of, its, unusual, triplet, ground, state, the, fluorescence, quantum, yield, gives, the, efficiency, of, the, fluorescence, process, it, is, defined, as, the, ratio, of, the, number, of, photons, emitted, to, the, number, of, photons, absorbed, p, 10, the, maximum, possible, fluorescence, quantum, yield, is, 1, 0, 100, each, photon, absorbed, results, in, a, photon, emitted, compounds, with, quantum, yields, of, 0, 10, are, still, considered, quite, fluorescent, another, way, to, define, the, quantum, yield, of, fluorescence, is, by, the, rate, of, excited, state, decay, where, k, f, displaystyle, k, f, is, the, rate, constant, of, spontaneous, emission, of, radiation, and, is, the, sum, of, all, rates, of, excited, state, decay, other, rates, of, excited, state, decay, are, caused, by, mechanisms, other, than, photon, emission, and, are, therefore, often, called, non, radiative, rates, which, can, include, thus, if, the, rate, of, any, pathway, changes, both, the, excited, state, lifetime, and, the, fluorescence, quantum, yield, will, be, affected, fluorescence, quantum, yields, are, measured, by, comparison, to, a, standard, the, quinine, salt, quinine, sulfate, in, a, sulfuric, acid, solution, was, regarded, as, the, most, common, fluorescence, standard, however, a, recent, study, revealed, that, the, fluorescence, quantum, yield, of, this, solution, is, strongly, affected, by, the, temperature, and, should, no, longer, be, used, as, the, standard, solution, the, quinine, in, 0, 1, m, perchloric, acid, 0, 60, shows, no, temperature, dependence, up, to, 45, c, therefore, it, can, be, considered, as, a, reliable, standard, solution, the, fluorescence, lifetime, refers, to, the, average, time, the, molecule, stays, in, its, excited, state, before, emitting, a, photon, fluorescence, typically, follows, first, order, kinetics, where, s, 1, displaystyle, left, is, the, concentration, of, excited, state, molecules, at, time, t, displaystyle, t, s, 1, 0, displaystyle, left, 0, is, the, initial, concentration, and, displaystyle, gamma, is, the, decay, rate, or, the, inverse, of, the, fluorescence, lifetime, this, is, an, instance, of, exponential, decay, various, radiative, and, non, radiative, processes, can, de, populate, the, excited, state, in, such, case, the, total, decay, rate, is, the, sum, over, all, rates, where, t, o, t, displaystyle, gamma, tot, is, the, total, decay, rate, r, a, d, displaystyle, gamma, rad, the, radiative, decay, rate, and, n, r, a, d, displaystyle, gamma, nrad, the, non, radiative, decay, rate, it, is, similar, to, a, first, order, chemical, reaction, in, which, the, first, order, rate, constant, is, the, sum, of, all, of, the, rates, a, parallel, kinetic, model, if, the, rate, of, spontaneous, emission, or, any, of, the, other, rates, are, fast, the, lifetime, is, short, for, commonly, used, fluorescent, compounds, typical, excited, state, decay, times, for, photon, emissions, with, energies, from, the, uv, to, near, infrared, are, within, the, range, of, 0, 5, to, 20, nanoseconds, the, fluorescence, lifetime, is, an, important, parameter, for, practical, applications, of, fluorescence, such, as, fluorescence, resonance, energy, transfer, and, fluorescence, lifetime, imaging, microscopy, the, jablonski, diagram, describes, most, of, the, relaxation, mechanisms, for, excited, state, molecules, the, diagram, alongside, shows, how, fluorescence, occurs, due, to, the, relaxation, of, certain, excited, electrons, of, a, molecule, fluorophores, are, more, likely, to, be, excited, by, photons, if, the, transition, moment, of, the, fluorophore, is, parallel, to, the, electric, vector, of, the, photon, pp, 12, 13, the, polarization, of, the, emitted, light, will, also, depend, on, the, transition, moment, the, transition, moment, is, dependent, on, the, physical, orientation, of, the, fluorophore, molecule, for, fluorophores, in, solution, the, intensity, and, polarization, of, the, emitted, light, is, dependent, on, rotational, diffusion, therefore, anisotropy, measurements, can, be, used, to, investigate, how, freely, a, fluorescent, molecule, moves, in, a, particular, environment, fluorescence, anisotropy, can, be, defined, quantitatively, as, where, i, displaystyle, i, parallel, is, the, emitted, intensity, parallel, to, the, polarization, of, the, excitation, light, and, i, displaystyle, i, perp, is, the, emitted, intensity, perpendicular, to, the, polarization, of, the, excitation, light, anisotropy, is, independent, of, the, intensity, of, the, absorbed, or, emitted, light, it, is, the, property, of, the, light, so, photobleaching, of, the, dye, will, not, affect, the, anisotropy, value, as, long, as, the, signal, is, detectable, strongly, fluorescent, pigments, often, have, an, unusual, appearance, which, is, often, described, colloquially, as, a, neon, color, originally, day, glo, in, the, late, 1960s, early, 1970s, this, phenomenon, was, termed, farbenglut, by, hermann, von, helmholtz, and, fluorence, by, ralph, m, evans, it, is, generally, thought, to, be, related, to, the, high, brightness, of, the, color, relative, to, what, it, would, be, as, a, component, of, white, fluorescence, shifts, energy, in, the, incident, illumination, from, shorter, wavelengths, to, longer, such, as, blue, to, yellow, and, thus, can, make, the, fluorescent, color, appear, brighter, more, saturated, than, it, could, possibly, be, by, reflection, alone, there, are, several, general, rules, that, deal, with, fluorescence, each, of, the, following, rules, have, exceptions, but, they, are, useful, guidelines, for, understanding, fluorescence, these, rules, do, not, necessarily, apply, to, two, photon, absorption, kasha, s, rule, states, that, the, luminesce, fluorescence, or, phosphorescence, of, a, molecule, will, be, emitted, only, from, the, lowest, excited, state, of, its, given, multiplicity, vavilov, s, rule, a, logical, extension, of, kasha, s, rule, thusly, called, kasha, vavilov, rule, dictates, that, the, quantum, yield, of, luminescence, is, independent, of, the, wavelength, of, exciting, radiation, and, is, proportional, to, the, absorbance, of, the, excited, wavelength, kasha, s, rule, does, not, always, apply, and, is, violated, by, simple, molecules, such, an, example, is, azulene, a, somewhat, more, reliable, statement, although, still, with, exceptions, would, be, that, the, fluorescence, spectrum, shows, very, little, dependence, on, the, wavelength, of, exciting, radiation, for, many, fluorophores, the, absorption, spectrum, is, a, mirror, image, of, the, emission, spectrum, pp, 6, 8, this, is, known, as, the, mirror, image, rule, and, is, related, to, the, franck, condon, principle, which, states, that, electronic, transitions, are, vertical, that, is, energy, changes, without, distance, changing, as, can, be, represented, with, a, vertical, line, in, jablonski, diagram, this, means, the, nucleus, does, not, move, and, the, vibration, levels, of, the, excited, state, resemble, the, vibration, levels, of, the, ground, state, in, general, emitted, fluorescence, light, has, a, longer, wavelength, and, lower, energy, than, the, absorbed, light, pp, 6, 7, this, phenomenon, known, as, stokes, shift, is, due, to, energy, loss, between, the, time, a, photon, is, absorbed, and, when, a, new, one, is, emitted, the, causes, and, magnitude, of, stokes, shift, can, be, complex, and, are, dependent, on, the, fluorophore, and, its, environment, however, there, are, some, common, causes, it, is, frequently, due, to, non, radiative, decay, to, the, lowest, vibrational, energy, level, of, the, excited, state, another, factor, is, that, the, emission, of, fluorescence, frequently, leaves, a, fluorophore, in, a, higher, vibrational, level, of, the, ground, state, there, are, many, natural, compounds, that, exhibit, fluorescence, and, they, have, a, number, of, applications, some, deep, sea, animals, such, as, the, greeneye, have, fluorescent, structures, fluorescence, is, the, phenomenon, of, absorption, of, electromagnetic, radiation, typically, from, ultraviolet, or, visible, light, by, a, molecule, and, the, subsequent, emission, of, a, photon, of, a, lower, energy, smaller, frequency, longer, wavelength, this, causes, the, light, that, is, emitted, to, be, a, different, color, than, the, light, that, is, absorbed, stimulating, light, excites, an, electron, to, an, excited, state, when, the, molecule, returns, to, the, ground, state, it, releases, a, photon, which, is, the, fluorescent, emission, the, excited, state, lifetime, is, short, so, emission, of, light, is, typically, only, observable, when, the, absorbing, light, is, on, fluorescence, can, be, of, any, wavelength, but, is, often, more, significant, when, emitted, photons, are, in, the, visible, spectrum, when, it, occurs, in, a, living, organism, it, is, sometimes, called, biofluorescence, fluorescence, should, not, be, confused, with, bioluminescence, and, biophosphorescence, pumpkin, toadlets, that, live, in, the, brazilian, atlantic, forest, are, fluorescent, bioluminescence, differs, from, fluorescence, in, that, it, is, the, natural, production, of, light, by, chemical, reactions, within, an, organism, whereas, fluorescence, is, the, absorption, and, reemission, of, light, from, the, environment, fireflies, and, anglerfish, are, two, examples, of, bioluminescent, organisms, to, add, to, the, potential, confusion, some, organisms, are, both, bioluminescent, and, fluorescent, like, the, sea, pansy, renilla, reniformis, where, bioluminescence, serves, as, the, light, source, for, fluorescence, phosphorescence, is, similar, to, fluorescence, in, its, requirement, of, light, wavelengths, as, a, provider, of, excitation, energy, the, difference, here, lies, in, the, relative, stability, of, the, energized, electron, unlike, with, fluorescence, in, phosphorescence, the, electron, retains, stability, emitting, light, that, continues, to, glow, in, the, dark, even, after, the, stimulating, light, source, has, been, removed, for, example, glow, in, the, dark, stickers, are, phosphorescent, but, there, are, no, truly, biophosphorescent, animals, known, pigment, cells, that, exhibit, fluorescence, are, called, fluorescent, chromatophores, and, function, somatically, similar, to, regular, chromatophores, these, cells, are, dendritic, and, contain, pigments, called, fluorosomes, these, pigments, contain, fluorescent, proteins, which, are, activated, by, k, potassium, ions, and, it, is, their, movement, aggregation, and, dispersion, within, the, fluorescent, chromatophore, that, cause, directed, fluorescence, patterning, fluorescent, cells, are, innervated, the, same, as, other, chromatophores, like, melanophores, pigment, cells, that, contain, melanin, short, term, fluorescent, patterning, and, signaling, is, controlled, by, the, nervous, system, fluorescent, chromatophores, can, be, found, in, the, skin, e, g, in, fish, just, below, the, epidermis, amongst, other, chromatophores, epidermal, fluorescent, cells, in, fish, also, respond, to, hormonal, stimuli, by, the, msh, and, mch, hormones, much, the, same, as, melanophores, this, suggests, that, fluorescent, cells, may, have, color, changes, throughout, the, day, that, coincide, with, their, circadian, rhythm, fish, may, also, be, sensitive, to, cortisol, induced, stress, responses, to, environmental, stimuli, such, as, interaction, with, a, predator, or, engaging, in, a, mating, ritual, the, incidence, of, fluorescence, across, the, tree, of, life, is, widespread, and, has, been, studied, most, extensively, in, cnidarians, and, fish, the, phenomenon, appears, to, have, evolved, multiple, times, in, multiple, taxa, such, as, in, the, anguilliformes, eels, gobioidei, gobies, and, cardinalfishes, and, tetradontiformes, triggerfishes, along, with, the, other, taxa, discussed, later, in, the, article, fluorescence, is, highly, genotypically, and, phenotypically, variable, even, within, ecosystems, in, regards, to, the, wavelengths, emitted, the, patterns, displayed, and, the, intensity, of, the, fluorescence, generally, the, species, relying, upon, camouflage, exhibit, the, greatest, diversity, in, fluorescence, likely, because, camouflage, may, be, one, of, the, uses, of, fluorescence, it, is, suspected, by, some, scientists, that, gfps, and, gfp, like, proteins, began, as, electron, donors, activated, by, light, these, electrons, were, then, used, for, reactions, requiring, light, energy, functions, of, fluorescent, proteins, such, as, protection, from, the, sun, conversion, of, light, into, different, wavelengths, or, for, signaling, are, thought, to, have, evolved, secondarily, currently, relatively, little, is, known, about, the, functional, significance, of, fluorescence, and, fluorescent, proteins, however, it, is, suspected, that, fluorescence, may, serve, important, functions, in, signaling, and, communication, mating, lures, camouflage, uv, protection, and, antioxidation, photoacclimation, dinoflagellate, regulation, and, in, coral, health, water, absorbs, light, of, long, wavelengths, so, less, light, from, these, wavelengths, reflects, back, to, reach, the, eye, therefore, warm, colors, from, the, visual, light, spectrum, appear, less, vibrant, at, increasing, depths, water, scatters, light, of, shorter, wavelengths, above, violet, meaning, cooler, colors, dominate, the, visual, field, in, the, photic, zone, light, intensity, decreases, 10, fold, with, every, 75, m, of, depth, so, at, depths, of, 75, m, light, is, 10, as, intense, as, it, is, on, the, surface, and, is, only, 1, as, intense, at, 150, m, as, it, is, on, the, surface, because, the, water, filters, out, the, wavelengths, and, intensity, of, water, reaching, certain, depths, different, proteins, because, of, the, wavelengths, and, intensities, of, light, they, are, capable, of, absorbing, are, better, suited, to, different, depths, theoretically, some, fish, eyes, can, detect, light, as, deep, as, 1000, m, at, these, depths, of, the, aphotic, zone, the, only, sources, of, light, are, organisms, themselves, giving, off, light, through, chemical, reactions, in, a, process, called, bioluminescence, fluorescence, is, simply, defined, as, the, absorption, of, electromagnetic, radiation, at, one, wavelength, and, its, reemission, at, another, lower, energy, wavelength, thus, any, type, of, fluorescence, depends, on, the, presence, of, external, sources, of, light, biologically, functional, fluorescence, is, found, in, the, photic, zone, where, there, is, not, only, enough, light, to, cause, fluorescence, but, enough, light, for, other, organisms, to, detect, it, the, visual, field, in, the, photic, zone, is, naturally, blue, so, colors, of, fluorescence, can, be, detected, as, bright, reds, oranges, yellows, and, greens, green, is, the, most, commonly, found, color, in, the, marine, spectrum, yellow, the, second, most, orange, the, third, and, red, is, the, rarest, fluorescence, can, occur, in, organisms, in, the, aphotic, zone, as, a, byproduct, of, that, same, organism, s, bioluminescence, some, fluorescence, in, the, aphotic, zone, is, merely, a, byproduct, of, the, organism, s, tissue, biochemistry, and, does, not, have, a, functional, purpose, however, some, cases, of, functional, and, adaptive, significance, of, fluorescence, in, the, aphotic, zone, of, the, deep, ocean, is, an, active, area, of, research, bony, fishes, living, in, shallow, water, generally, have, good, color, vision, due, to, their, living, in, a, colorful, environment, thus, in, shallow, water, fishes, red, orange, and, green, fluorescence, most, likely, serves, as, a, means, of, communication, with, conspecifics, especially, given, the, great, phenotypic, variance, of, the, phenomenon, many, fish, that, exhibit, fluorescence, such, as, sharks, lizardfish, scorpionfish, wrasses, and, flatfishes, also, possess, yellow, intraocular, filters, yellow, intraocular, filters, in, the, lenses, and, cornea, of, certain, fishes, function, as, long, pass, filters, these, filters, enable, the, species, to, visualize, and, potentially, exploit, fluorescence, in, order, to, enhance, visual, contrast, and, patterns, that, are, unseen, to, other, fishes, and, predators, that, lack, this, visual, specialization, fish, that, possess, the, necessary, yellow, intraocular, filters, for, visualizing, fluorescence, potentially, exploit, a, light, signal, from, members, of, it, fluorescent, patterning, was, especially, prominent, in, cryptically, patterned, fishes, possessing, complex, camouflage, many, of, these, lineages, also, possess, yellow, long, pass, intraocular, filters, that, could, enable, visualization, of, such, patterns, another, adaptive, use, of, fluorescence, is, to, generate, orange, and, red, light, from, the, ambient, blue, light, of, the, photic, zone, to, aid, vision, red, light, can, only, be, seen, across, short, distances, due, to, attenuation, of, red, light, wavelengths, by, water, many, fish, species, that, fluoresce, are, small, group, living, or, benthic, aphotic, and, have, conspicuous, patterning, this, patterning, is, caused, by, fluorescent, tissue, and, is, visible, to, other, members, of, the, species, however, the, patterning, is, invisible, at, other, visual, spectra, these, intraspecific, fluorescent, patterns, also, coincide, with, intra, species, signaling, the, patterns, present, in, ocular, rings, to, indicate, directionality, of, an, individual, s, gaze, and, along, fins, to, indicate, directionality, of, an, individual, s, movement, current, research, suspects, that, this, red, fluorescence, is, used, for, private, communication, between, members, of, the, same, species, due, to, the, prominence, of, blue, light, at, ocean, depths, red, light, and, light, of, longer, wavelengths, are, muddled, and, many, predatory, reef, fish, have, little, to, no, sensitivity, for, light, at, these, wavelengths, fish, such, as, the, fairy, wrasse, that, have, developed, visual, sensitivity, to, longer, wavelengths, are, able, to, display, red, fluorescent, signals, that, give, a, high, contrast, to, the, blue, environment, and, are, conspicuous, to, conspecifics, in, short, ranges, yet, are, relatively, invisible, to, other, common, fish, that, have, reduced, sensitivities, to, long, wavelengths, thus, fluorescence, can, be, used, as, adaptive, signaling, and, intra, species, communication, in, reef, fish, additionally, it, is, suggested, that, fluorescent, tissues, that, surround, an, organism, s, eyes, are, used, to, convert, blue, light, from, the, photic, zone, or, green, bioluminescence, in, the, aphotic, zone, into, red, light, to, aid, vision, a, new, fluorophore, was, described, in, two, species, of, sharks, wherein, it, was, due, to, an, undescribed, group, of, brominated, tryptophane, kynurenine, small, molecule, metabolites, fluorescence, serves, a, wide, variety, of, functions, in, coral, fluorescent, proteins, in, corals, may, contribute, to, photosynthesis, by, converting, otherwise, unusable, wavelengths, of, light, into, ones, for, which, the, coral, s, symbiotic, algae, are, able, to, conduct, photosynthesis, also, the, proteins, may, fluctuate, in, number, as, more, or, less, light, becomes, available, as, a, means, of, photoacclimation, similarly, these, fluorescent, proteins, may, possess, antioxidant, capacities, to, eliminate, oxygen, radicals, produced, by, photosynthesis, finally, through, modulating, photosynthesis, the, fluorescent, proteins, may, also, serve, as, a, means, of, regulating, the, activity, of, the, coral, s, photosynthetic, algal, symbionts, alloteuthis, subulata, and, loligo, vulgaris, two, types, of, nearly, transparent, squid, have, fluorescent, spots, above, their, eyes, these, spots, reflect, incident, light, which, may, serve, as, a, means, of, camouflage, but, also, for, signaling, to, other, squids, for, schooling, purposes, another, well, studied, example, of, fluorescence, in, the, ocean, is, the, hydrozoan, aequorea, victoria, this, jellyfish, lives, in, the, photic, zone, off, the, west, coast, of, north, america, and, was, identified, as, a, carrier, of, green, fluorescent, protein, gfp, by, osamu, shimomura, the, gene, for, these, green, fluorescent, proteins, has, been, isolated, and, is, scientifically, significant, because, it, is, widely, used, in, genetic, studies, to, indicate, the, expression, of, other, genes, several, species, of, mantis, shrimp, which, are, stomatopod, crustaceans, including, lysiosquillina, glabriuscula, have, yellow, fluorescent, markings, along, their, antennal, scales, and, carapace, shell, that, males, present, during, threat, displays, to, predators, and, other, males, the, display, involves, raising, the, head, and, thorax, spreading, the, striking, appendages, and, other, maxillipeds, and, extending, the, prominent, oval, antennal, scales, laterally, which, makes, the, animal, appear, larger, and, accentuates, its, yellow, fluorescent, markings, furthermore, as, depth, increases, mantis, shrimp, fluorescence, accounts, for, a, greater, part, of, the, visible, light, available, during, mating, rituals, mantis, shrimp, actively, fluoresce, and, the, wavelength, of, this, fluorescence, matches, the, wavelengths, detected, by, their, eye, pigments, siphonophorae, is, an, order, of, marine, animals, from, the, phylum, hydrozoa, that, consist, of, a, specialized, medusoid, and, polyp, zooid, some, siphonophores, including, the, genus, erenna, that, live, in, the, aphotic, zone, between, depths, of, 1600, m, and, 2300, m, exhibit, yellow, to, red, fluorescence, in, the, photophores, of, their, tentacle, like, tentilla, this, fluorescence, occurs, as, a, by, product, of, bioluminescence, from, these, same, photophores, the, siphonophores, exhibit, the, fluorescence, in, a, flicking, pattern, that, is, used, as, a, lure, to, attract, prey, the, predatory, deep, sea, dragonfish, malacosteus, niger, the, closely, related, genus, aristostomias, and, the, species, pachystomias, microdon, use, fluorescent, red, accessory, pigments, to, convert, the, blue, light, emitted, from, their, own, bioluminescence, to, red, light, from, suborbital, photophores, this, red, luminescence, is, invisible, to, other, animals, which, allows, these, dragonfish, extra, light, at, dark, ocean, depths, without, attracting, or, signaling, predators, fluorescence, is, widespread, among, amphibians, and, has, been, documented, in, several, families, of, frogs, salamanders, and, caecilians, but, the, extent, of, it, varies, greatly, the, polka, dot, tree, frog, hypsiboas, punctatus, widely, found, in, south, america, was, unintentionally, discovered, to, be, the, first, fluorescent, amphibian, in, 2017, the, fluorescence, was, traced, to, a, new, compound, found, in, the, lymph, and, skin, glands, the, main, fluorescent, compound, is, hyloin, l1, and, it, gives, a, blue, green, glow, when, exposed, to, violet, or, ultraviolet, light, the, scientists, behind, the, discovery, suggested, that, the, fluorescence, can, be, used, for, communication, they, speculated, that, fluorescence, possibly, is, relatively, widespread, among, frogs, only, a, few, months, later, fluorescence, was, discovered, in, the, closely, related, hypsiboas, atlanticus, because, it, is, linked, to, secretions, from, skin, glands, they, can, also, leave, fluorescent, markings, on, surfaces, where, they, have, been, in, 2019, two, other, frogs, the, tiny, pumpkin, toadlet, brachycephalus, ephippium, and, red, pumpkin, toadlet, b, pitanga, of, southeastern, brazil, were, found, to, have, naturally, fluorescent, skeletons, which, are, visible, through, their, skin, when, exposed, to, ultraviolet, light, it, was, initially, speculated, that, the, fluorescence, supplemented, their, already, aposematic, colours, they, are, toxic, or, that, it, was, related, to, mate, choice, species, recognition, or, determining, fitness, of, a, potential, partner, but, later, studies, indicate, that, the, former, explanation, is, unlikely, as, predation, attempts, on, the, toadlets, appear, to, be, unaffected, by, the, presence, absence, of, fluorescence, in, 2020, it, was, confirmed, that, green, or, yellow, fluorescence, is, widespread, not, only, in, adult, frogs, that, are, exposed, to, blue, or, ultraviolet, light, but, also, among, tadpoles, salamanders, and, caecilians, the, extent, varies, greatly, depending, on, species, in, some, it, is, highly, distinct, and, in, others, it, is, barely, noticeable, it, can, be, based, on, their, skin, pigmentation, their, mucous, or, their, bones, swallowtail, papilio, butterflies, have, complex, systems, for, emitting, fluorescent, light, their, wings, contain, pigment, infused, crystals, that, provide, directed, fluorescent, light, these, crystals, function, to, produce, fluorescent, light, best, when, they, absorb, radiance, from, sky, blue, light, wavelength, about, 420, nm, the, wavelengths, of, light, that, the, butterflies, see, the, best, correspond, to, the, absorbance, of, the, crystals, in, the, butterfly, s, wings, this, likely, functions, to, enhance, the, capacity, for, signaling, parrots, have, fluorescent, plumage, that, may, be, used, in, mate, signaling, a, study, using, mate, choice, experiments, on, budgerigars, melopsittacus, undulates, found, compelling, support, for, fluorescent, sexual, signaling, with, both, males, and, females, significantly, preferring, birds, with, the, fluorescent, experimental, stimulus, this, study, suggests, that, the, fluorescent, plumage, of, parrots, is, not, simply, a, by, product, of, pigmentation, but, instead, an, adapted, sexual, signal, considering, the, intricacies, of, the, pathways, that, produce, fluorescent, pigments, there, may, be, significant, costs, involved, therefore, individuals, exhibiting, strong, fluorescence, may, be, honest, indicators, of, high, individual, quality, since, they, can, deal, with, the, associated, costs, spiders, fluoresce, under, uv, light, and, possess, a, huge, diversity, of, fluorophores, andrews, reed, masta, noted, that, spiders, are, the, only, known, group, in, which, fluorescence, is, taxonomically, widespread, variably, expressed, evolutionarily, labile, and, probably, under, selection, and, potentially, of, ecological, importance, for, intraspecific, and, interspecific, signaling, they, showed, that, fluorescence, evolved, multiple, times, across, spider, taxa, with, novel, fluorophores, evolving, during, spider, diversification, in, some, spiders, ultraviolet, cues, are, important, for, predator, prey, interactions, intraspecific, communication, and, camouflage, matching, with, fluorescent, flowers, differing, ecological, contexts, could, favor, inhibition, or, enhancement, of, fluorescence, expression, depending, upon, whether, fluorescence, helps, spiders, be, cryptic, or, makes, them, more, conspicuous, to, predators, therefore, natural, selection, could, be, acting, on, expression, of, fluorescence, across, spider, species, scorpions, are, also, fluorescent, in, their, case, due, to, the, presence, of, beta, carboline, in, their, cuticles, in, 2020, fluorescence, was, reported, for, several, platypus, specimens, many, plants, are, fluorescent, due, to, the, presence, of, chlorophyll, which, is, probably, the, most, widely, distributed, fluorescent, molecule, producing, red, emission, under, a, range, of, excitation, wavelengths, this, attribute, of, chlorophyll, is, commonly, used, by, ecologists, to, measure, photosynthetic, efficiency, the, mirabilis, jalapa, flower, contains, violet, fluorescent, betacyanins, and, yellow, fluorescent, betaxanthins, under, white, light, parts, of, the, flower, containing, only, betaxanthins, appear, yellow, but, in, areas, where, both, betaxanthins, and, betacyanins, are, present, the, visible, fluorescence, of, the, flower, is, faded, due, to, internal, light, filtering, mechanisms, fluorescence, was, previously, suggested, to, play, a, role, in, pollinator, attraction, however, it, was, later, found, that, the, visual, signal, by, fluorescence, is, negligible, compared, to, the, visual, signal, of, light, reflected, by, the, flower, in, addition, to, the, eponyous, fluorspar, many, gemstones, and, minerals, may, have, a, distinctive, fluorescence, or, may, fluoresce, differently, under, short, wave, ultraviolet, long, wave, ultraviolet, visible, light, or, x, rays, many, types, of, calcite, and, amber, will, fluoresce, under, shortwave, uv, longwave, uv, and, visible, light, rubies, emeralds, and, diamonds, exhibit, red, fluorescence, under, long, wave, uv, blue, and, sometimes, green, light, diamonds, also, emit, light, under, x, ray, radiation, fluorescence, in, minerals, is, caused, by, a, wide, range, of, activators, in, some, cases, the, concentration, of, the, activator, must, be, restricted, to, below, a, certain, level, to, prevent, quenching, of, the, fluorescent, emission, furthermore, the, mineral, must, be, free, of, impurities, such, as, iron, or, copper, to, prevent, quenching, of, possible, fluorescence, divalent, manganese, in, concentrations, of, up, to, several, percent, is, responsible, for, the, red, or, orange, fluorescence, of, calcite, the, green, fluorescence, of, willemite, the, yellow, fluorescence, of, esperite, and, the, orange, fluorescence, of, wollastonite, and, clinohedrite, hexavalent, uranium, in, the, form, of, the, uranyl, cation, uo, 2, 2, fluoresces, at, all, concentrations, in, a, yellow, green, and, is, the, cause, of, fluorescence, of, minerals, such, as, autunite, or, andersonite, and, at, low, concentration, is, the, cause, of, the, fluorescence, of, such, materials, as, some, samples, of, hyalite, opal, trivalent, chromium, at, low, concentration, is, the, source, of, the, red, fluorescence, of, ruby, divalent, europium, is, the, source, of, the, blue, fluorescence, when, seen, in, the, mineral, fluorite, trivalent, lanthanides, such, as, terbium, and, dysprosium, are, the, principal, activators, of, the, creamy, yellow, fluorescence, exhibited, by, the, yttrofluorite, variety, of, the, mineral, fluorite, and, contribute, to, the, orange, fluorescence, of, zircon, powellite, calcium, molybdate, and, scheelite, calcium, tungstate, fluoresce, intrinsically, in, yellow, and, blue, respectively, when, present, together, in, solid, solution, energy, is, transferred, from, the, higher, energy, tungsten, to, the, lower, energy, molybdenum, such, that, fairly, low, levels, of, molybdenum, are, sufficient, to, cause, a, yellow, emission, for, scheelite, instead, of, blue, low, iron, sphalerite, zinc, sulfide, fluoresces, and, phosphoresces, in, a, range, of, colors, influenced, by, the, presence, of, various, trace, impurities, crude, oil, petroleum, fluoresces, in, a, range, of, colors, from, dull, brown, for, heavy, oils, and, tars, through, to, bright, yellowish, and, bluish, white, for, very, light, oils, and, condensates, this, phenomenon, is, used, in, oil, exploration, drilling, to, identify, very, small, amounts, of, oil, in, drill, cuttings, and, core, samples, humic, acids, and, fulvic, acids, produced, by, the, degradation, of, organic, matter, in, soils, humus, may, also, fluoresce, because, of, the, presence, of, aromatic, cycles, in, their, complex, molecular, structures, humic, substances, dissolved, in, groundwater, can, be, detected, and, characterized, by, spectrofluorimetry, organic, carbon, based, solutions, such, anthracene, or, stilbene, dissolved, in, benzene, or, toluene, fluoresce, with, ultraviolet, or, gamma, ray, irradiation, the, decay, times, of, this, fluorescence, are, on, the, order, of, nanoseconds, since, the, duration, of, the, light, depends, on, the, lifetime, of, the, excited, states, of, the, fluorescent, material, in, this, case, anthracene, or, stilbene, scintillation, is, defined, a, flash, of, light, produced, in, a, transparent, material, by, the, passage, of, a, particle, an, electron, an, alpha, particle, an, ion, or, a, high, energy, photon, stilbene, and, derivatives, are, used, in, scintillation, counters, to, detect, such, particles, stilbene, is, also, one, of, the, gain, mediums, used, in, dye, lasers, fluorescence, is, observed, in, the, atmosphere, when, the, air, is, under, energetic, electron, bombardment, in, cases, such, as, the, natural, aurora, high, altitude, nuclear, explosions, and, rocket, borne, electron, gun, experiments, the, molecules, and, ions, formed, have, a, fluorescent, response, to, light, in, august, 2020, researchers, reported, the, creation, of, the, brightest, fluorescent, solid, optical, materials, so, far, by, enabling, the, transfer, of, properties, of, highly, fluorescent, dyes, via, spatial, and, electronic, isolation, of, the, dyes, by, mixing, cationic, dyes, with, anion, binding, cyanostar, macrocycles, according, to, a, co, author, these, materials, may, have, applications, in, areas, such, as, solar, energy, harvesting, bioimaging, and, lasers, the, common, fluorescent, lamp, relies, on, fluorescence, inside, the, glass, tube, is, a, partial, vacuum, and, a, small, amount, of, mercury, an, electric, discharge, in, the, tube, causes, the, mercury, atoms, to, emit, mostly, ultraviolet, light, the, tube, is, lined, with, a, coating, of, a, fluorescent, material, called, the, phosphor, which, absorbs, ultraviolet, light, and, re, emits, visible, light, fluorescent, lighting, is, more, energy, efficient, than, incandescent, lighting, elements, however, the, uneven, spectrum, of, traditional, fluorescent, lamps, may, cause, certain, colors, to, appear, different, from, when, illuminated, by, incandescent, light, or, daylight, the, mercury, vapor, emission, spectrum, is, dominated, by, a, short, wave, uv, line, at, 254, nm, which, provides, most, of, the, energy, to, the, phosphors, accompanied, by, visible, light, emission, at, 436, nm, blue, 546, nm, green, and, 579, nm, yellow, orange, these, three, lines, can, be, observed, superimposed, on, the, white, continuum, using, a, hand, spectroscope, for, light, emitted, by, the, usual, white, fluorescent, tubes, these, same, visible, lines, accompanied, by, the, emission, lines, of, trivalent, europium, and, trivalent, terbium, and, further, accompanied, by, the, emission, continuum, of, divalent, europium, in, the, blue, region, comprise, the, more, discontinuous, light, emission, of, the, modern, trichromatic, phosphor, systems, used, in, many, compact, fluorescent, lamp, and, traditional, lamps, where, better, color, rendition, is, a, goal, fluorescent, lights, were, first, available, to, the, public, at, the, 1939, new, york, world, s, fair, improvements, since, then, have, largely, been, better, phosphors, longer, life, and, more, consistent, internal, discharge, and, easier, to, use, shapes, such, as, compact, fluorescent, lamps, some, high, intensity, discharge, hid, lamps, couple, their, even, greater, electrical, efficiency, with, phosphor, enhancement, for, better, color, rendition, white, light, emitting, diodes, leds, became, available, in, the, mid, 1990s, as, led, lamps, in, which, blue, light, emitted, from, the, semiconductor, strikes, phosphors, deposited, on, the, tiny, chip, the, combination, of, the, blue, light, that, continues, through, the, phosphor, and, the, green, to, red, fluorescence, from, the, phosphors, produces, a, net, emission, of, white, light, glow, sticks, sometimes, utilize, fluorescent, materials, to, absorb, light, from, the, chemiluminescent, reaction, and, emit, light, of, a, different, color, many, analytical, procedures, involve, the, use, of, a, fluorometer, usually, with, a, single, exciting, wavelength, and, single, detection, wavelength, because, of, the, sensitivity, that, the, method, affords, fluorescent, molecule, concentrations, as, low, as, 1, part, per, trillion, can, be, measured, fluorescence, in, several, wavelengths, can, be, detected, by, an, array, detector, to, detect, compounds, from, hplc, flow, also, tlc, plates, can, be, visualized, if, the, compounds, or, a, coloring, reagent, is, fluorescent, fluorescence, is, most, effective, when, there, is, a, larger, ratio, of, atoms, at, lower, energy, levels, in, a, boltzmann, distribution, there, is, then, a, higher, probability, of, excitement, and, release, of, photons, by, lower, energy, atoms, making, analysis, more, efficient, usually, the, setup, of, a, fluorescence, assay, involves, a, light, source, which, may, emit, many, different, wavelengths, of, light, in, general, a, single, wavelength, is, required, for, proper, analysis, so, in, order, to, selectively, filter, the, light, it, is, passed, through, an, excitation, monochromator, and, then, that, chosen, wavelength, is, passed, through, the, sample, cell, after, absorption, and, re, emission, of, the, energy, many, wavelengths, may, emerge, due, to, stokes, shift, and, various, electron, transitions, to, separate, and, analyze, them, the, fluorescent, radiation, is, passed, through, an, emission, monochromator, and, observed, selectively, by, a, detector, lasers, most, often, use, the, fluorescence, of, certain, materials, as, their, active, media, such, as, the, red, glow, produced, by, a, ruby, chromium, sapphire, the, infrared, of, titanium, sapphire, or, the, unlimited, range, of, colors, produced, by, organic, dyes, these, materials, normally, fluoresce, through, a, process, called, spontaneous, emission, in, which, the, light, is, emitted, in, all, directions, and, often, at, many, discrete, spectral, lines, all, at, once, in, many, lasers, the, fluorescent, medium, is, pumped, by, exposing, it, to, an, intense, light, source, creating, a, population, inversion, meaning, that, more, of, its, atoms, become, in, an, excited, state, high, energy, rather, than, at, ground, state, low, energy, when, this, occurs, the, spontaneous, fluorescence, can, then, induce, the, other, atoms, to, emit, their, photons, in, the, same, direction, and, at, the, same, wavelength, creating, stimulated, emission, when, a, portion, of, the, spontaneous, fluorescence, is, trapped, between, two, mirrors, nearly, all, of, the, medium, s, fluorescence, can, be, stimulated, to, emit, along, the, same, line, producing, a, laser, beam, fluorescence, in, the, life, sciences, is, used, generally, as, a, non, destructive, way, of, tracking, or, analysis, of, biological, molecules, by, means, of, the, fluorescent, emission, at, a, specific, frequency, where, there, is, no, background, from, the, excitation, light, as, relatively, few, cellular, components, are, naturally, fluorescent, called, intrinsic, or, autofluorescence, in, fact, a, protein, or, other, component, can, be, labelled, with, an, extrinsic, fluorophore, a, fluorescent, dye, that, can, be, a, small, molecule, protein, or, quantum, dot, finding, a, large, use, in, many, biological, applications, p, xxvi, the, quantification, of, a, dye, is, done, with, a, spectrofluorometer, and, finds, additional, applications, in, fingerprints, can, be, visualized, with, fluorescent, compounds, such, as, ninhydrin, or, dfo, 1, 8, diazafluoren, 9, one, blood, and, other, substances, are, sometimes, detected, by, fluorescent, reagents, like, fluorescein, fibers, and, other, materials, that, may, be, encountered, in, forensics, or, with, a, relationship, to, various, collectibles, are, sometimes, fluorescent, fluorescent, penetrant, inspection, is, used, to, find, cracks, and, other, defects, on, the, surface, of, a, part, dye, tracing, using, fluorescent, dyes, is, used, to, find, leaks, in, liquid, and, gas, plumbing, systems, fluorescent, colors, are, frequently, used, in, signage, particularly, road, signs, fluorescent, colors, are, generally, recognizable, at, longer, ranges, than, their, non, fluorescent, counterparts, with, fluorescent, orange, being, particularly, noticeable, this, property, has, led, to, its, frequent, use, in, safety, signs, and, labels, fluorescent, compounds, are, often, used, to, enhance, the, appearance, of, fabric, and, paper, causing, a, whitening, effect, a, white, surface, treated, with, an, optical, brightener, can, emit, more, visible, light, than, that, which, shines, on, it, making, it, appear, brighter, the, blue, light, emitted, by, the, brightener, compensates, for, the, diminishing, blue, of, the, treated, material, and, changes, the, hue, away, from, yellow, or, brown, and, toward, white, optical, brighteners, are, used, in, laundry, detergents, high, brightness, paper, cosmetics, high, visibility, clothing, and, more
