is, most, commonly, associated, with, a, state, of, disorder, randomness, or, uncertainty, the, term, and, the, concept, are, used, in, diverse, fields, from, classical, thermodynamics, where, it, was, first, recognized, to, the, microscopic, description, of, nature, in, statistical, physics, and, to, the, principles, of, information, theory, it, has, found, far, ranging, applications, in, chemistry, and, physics, in, biological, systems, and, their, relation, to, life, in, cosmology, economics, sociology, weather, science, climate, change, and, information, systems, including, the, transmission, of, information, in, telecommunication, entropy, is, central, to, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, which, states, that, the, entropy, of, an, isolated, system, left, to, spontaneous, evolution, cannot, decrease, with, time, as, a, result, isolated, systems, evolve, toward, thermodynamic, equilibrium, where, the, entropy, is, highest, a, consequence, of, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, is, that, certain, processes, are, irreversible, the, thermodynamic, concept, was, referred, to, by, scottish, scientist, and, engineer, william, rankine, in, 1850, with, the, names, thermodynamic, function, and, heat, potential, in, 1865, german, physicist, rudolf, clausius, one, of, the, leading, founders, of, the, field, of, thermodynamics, defined, it, as, the, quotient, of, an, infinitesimal, amount, of, heat, to, the, instantaneous, temperature, he, initially, described, it, as, transformation, content, in, german, verwandlungsinhalt, and, later, coined, the, term, entropy, from, a, greek, word, for, transformation, austrian, physicist, ludwig, boltzmann, explained, entropy, as, the, measure, of, the, number, of, possible, microscopic, arrangements, or, states, of, individual, atoms, and, molecules, of, a, system, that, comply, with, the, macroscopic, condition, of, the, system, he, thereby, introduced, the, concept, of, statistical, disorder, and, probability, distributions, into, a, new, field, of, thermodynamics, called, statistical, mechanics, and, found, the, link, between, the, microscopic, interactions, which, fluctuate, about, an, average, configuration, to, the, macroscopically, observable, behavior, in, form, of, a, simple, logarithmic, law, with, a, proportionality, constant, the, boltzmann, constant, that, has, become, one, of, the, defining, universal, constants, for, the, modern, international, system, of, units, si, in, his, 1803, paper, fundamental, principles, of, equilibrium, and, movement, the, french, mathematician, lazare, carnot, proposed, that, in, any, machine, the, accelerations, and, shocks, of, the, moving, parts, represent, losses, of, moment, of, activity, in, any, natural, process, there, exists, an, inherent, tendency, towards, the, dissipation, of, useful, energy, in, 1824, building, on, that, work, lazare, s, son, sadi, carnot, published, reflections, on, the, motive, power, of, fire, which, posited, that, in, all, heat, engines, whenever, caloric, what, is, now, known, as, heat, falls, through, a, temperature, difference, work, or, motive, power, can, be, produced, from, the, actions, of, its, fall, from, a, hot, to, cold, body, he, used, an, analogy, with, how, water, falls, in, a, water, wheel, that, was, an, early, insight, into, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, carnot, based, his, views, of, heat, partially, on, the, early, 18th, century, newtonian, hypothesis, that, both, heat, and, light, were, types, of, indestructible, forms, of, matter, which, are, attracted, and, repelled, by, other, matter, and, partially, on, the, contemporary, views, of, count, rumford, who, showed, in, 1789, that, heat, could, be, created, by, friction, as, when, cannon, bores, are, machined, carnot, reasoned, that, if, the, body, of, the, working, substance, such, as, a, body, of, steam, is, returned, to, its, original, state, at, the, end, of, a, complete, engine, cycle, no, change, occurs, in, the, condition, of, the, working, body, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, deduced, from, the, heat, friction, experiments, of, james, joule, in, 1843, expresses, the, concept, of, energy, and, its, conservation, in, all, processes, the, first, law, however, is, unsuitable, to, separately, quantify, the, effects, of, friction, and, dissipation, in, the, 1850s, and, 1860s, german, physicist, rudolf, clausius, objected, to, the, supposition, that, no, change, occurs, in, the, working, body, and, gave, that, change, a, mathematical, interpretation, by, questioning, the, nature, of, the, inherent, loss, of, usable, heat, when, work, is, done, e, g, heat, produced, by, friction, he, described, his, observations, as, a, dissipative, use, of, energy, resulting, in, a, transformation, content, verwandlungsinhalt, in, german, of, a, thermodynamic, system, or, working, body, of, chemical, species, during, a, change, of, state, that, was, in, contrast, to, earlier, views, based, on, the, theories, of, isaac, newton, that, heat, was, an, indestructible, particle, that, had, mass, clausius, discovered, that, the, non, usable, energy, increases, as, steam, proceeds, from, inlet, to, exhaust, in, a, steam, engine, from, the, prefix, en, as, in, energy, and, from, the, greek, word, which, is, translated, in, an, established, lexicon, as, turning, or, change, and, that, he, rendered, in, german, as, verwandlung, a, word, often, translated, into, english, as, transformation, in, 1865, clausius, coined, the, name, of, that, property, as, entropy, the, word, was, adopted, into, the, english, language, in, 1868, later, scientists, such, as, ludwig, boltzmann, josiah, willard, gibbs, and, james, clerk, maxwell, gave, entropy, a, statistical, basis, in, 1877, boltzmann, visualized, a, probabilistic, way, to, measure, the, entropy, of, an, ensemble, of, ideal, gas, particles, in, which, he, defined, entropy, as, proportional, to, the, natural, logarithm, of, the, number, of, microstates, such, a, gas, could, occupy, the, proportionality, constant, in, this, definition, called, the, boltzmann, constant, has, become, one, of, the, defining, universal, constants, for, the, modern, international, system, of, units, si, henceforth, the, essential, problem, in, statistical, thermodynamics, has, been, to, determine, the, distribution, of, a, given, amount, of, energy, e, over, n, identical, systems, constantin, carath, odory, a, greek, mathematician, linked, entropy, with, a, mathematical, definition, of, irreversibility, in, terms, of, trajectories, and, integrability, in, 1865, clausius, named, the, concept, of, the, differential, of, a, quantity, which, depends, on, the, configuration, of, the, system, entropy, entropie, after, the, greek, word, for, transformation, he, gave, transformational, content, verwandlungsinhalt, as, a, synonym, paralleling, his, thermal, and, ergonal, content, w, rme, und, werkinhalt, as, the, name, of, u, but, preferring, the, term, entropy, as, a, close, parallel, of, the, word, energy, as, he, found, the, concepts, nearly, analogous, in, their, physical, significance, this, term, was, formed, by, replacing, the, root, of, ergon, work, by, that, of, tropy, transformation, in, more, detail, clausius, explained, his, choice, of, entropy, as, a, name, as, follows, i, prefer, going, to, the, ancient, languages, for, the, names, of, important, scientific, quantities, so, that, they, may, mean, the, same, thing, in, all, living, tongues, i, propose, therefore, to, call, s, the, entropy, of, a, body, after, the, greek, word, transformation, i, have, designedly, coined, the, word, entropy, to, be, similar, to, energy, for, these, two, quantities, are, so, analogous, in, their, physical, significance, that, an, analogy, of, denominations, seems, to, me, helpful, leon, cooper, added, that, in, this, way, he, succeeded, in, coining, a, word, that, meant, the, same, thing, to, everybody, nothing, any, method, involving, the, notion, of, entropy, the, very, existence, of, which, depends, on, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, will, doubtless, seem, to, many, far, fetched, and, may, repel, beginners, as, obscure, and, difficult, of, comprehension, willard, gibbs, graphical, methods, in, the, thermodynamics, of, fluids, the, concept, of, entropy, is, described, by, two, principal, approaches, the, macroscopic, perspective, of, classical, thermodynamics, and, the, microscopic, description, central, to, statistical, mechanics, the, classical, approach, defines, entropy, in, terms, of, macroscopically, measurable, physical, properties, such, as, bulk, mass, volume, pressure, and, temperature, the, statistical, definition, of, entropy, defines, it, in, terms, of, the, statistics, of, the, motions, of, the, microscopic, constituents, of, a, system, modeled, at, first, classically, e, g, newtonian, particles, constituting, a, gas, and, later, quantum, mechanically, photons, phonons, spins, etc, the, two, approaches, form, a, consistent, unified, view, of, the, same, phenomenon, as, expressed, in, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, which, has, found, universal, applicability, to, physical, processes, many, thermodynamic, properties, are, defined, by, physical, variables, that, define, a, state, of, thermodynamic, equilibrium, which, essentially, are, state, variables, state, variables, depend, only, on, the, equilibrium, condition, not, on, the, path, evolution, to, that, state, state, variables, can, be, functions, of, state, also, called, state, functions, in, a, sense, that, one, state, variable, is, a, mathematical, function, of, other, state, variables, often, if, some, properties, of, a, system, are, determined, they, are, sufficient, to, determine, the, state, of, the, system, and, thus, other, properties, values, for, example, temperature, and, pressure, of, a, given, quantity, of, gas, determine, its, state, and, thus, also, its, volume, via, the, ideal, gas, law, a, system, composed, of, a, pure, substance, of, a, single, phase, at, a, particular, uniform, temperature, and, pressure, is, determined, and, is, thus, a, particular, state, and, has, a, particular, volume, the, fact, that, entropy, is, a, function, of, state, makes, it, useful, in, the, carnot, cycle, the, working, fluid, returns, to, the, same, state, that, it, had, at, the, start, of, the, cycle, hence, the, change, or, line, integral, of, any, state, function, such, as, entropy, over, this, reversible, cycle, is, zero, the, entropy, change, d, s, textstyle, mathrm, d, s, of, a, system, excluding, its, surroundings, can, be, well, defined, as, a, small, portion, of, heat, q, r, e, v, textstyle, delta, q, mathsf, rev, transferred, to, the, system, during, reversible, process, divided, by, the, temperature, t, textstyle, t, of, the, system, during, this, heat, transfer, d, s, q, r, e, v, t, displaystyle, mathrm, d, s, frac, delta, q, mathsf, rev, t, the, reversible, process, is, quasistatic, i, e, it, occurs, without, any, dissipation, deviating, only, infinitesimally, from, the, thermodynamic, equilibrium, and, it, may, conserve, total, entropy, for, example, in, the, carnot, cycle, while, the, heat, flow, from, a, hot, reservoir, to, a, cold, reservoir, represents, the, increase, in, the, entropy, in, a, cold, reservoir, the, work, output, if, reversibly, and, perfectly, stored, represents, the, decrease, in, the, entropy, which, could, be, used, to, operate, the, heat, engine, in, reverse, returning, to, the, initial, state, thus, the, total, entropy, change, may, still, be, zero, at, all, times, if, the, entire, process, is, reversible, in, contrast, irreversible, process, increases, the, total, entropy, of, the, system, and, surroundings, any, process, that, happens, quickly, enough, to, deviate, from, the, thermal, equilibrium, cannot, be, reversible, the, total, entropy, increases, and, the, potential, for, maximum, work, to, be, done, during, the, process, is, lost, the, concept, of, entropy, arose, from, rudolf, clausius, s, study, of, the, carnot, cycle, that, is, a, thermodynamic, cycle, performed, by, a, carnot, heat, engine, as, a, reversible, heat, engine, in, a, carnot, cycle, the, heat, q, h, textstyle, q, mathsf, h, is, transferred, from, a, hot, reservoir, to, a, working, gas, at, the, constant, temperature, t, h, textstyle, t, mathsf, h, during, isothermal, expansion, stage, and, the, heat, q, c, textstyle, q, mathsf, c, is, transferred, from, a, working, gas, to, a, cold, reservoir, at, the, constant, temperature, t, c, textstyle, t, mathsf, c, during, isothermal, compression, stage, according, to, carnot, s, theorem, a, heat, engine, with, two, thermal, reservoirs, can, produce, a, work, w, textstyle, w, if, and, only, if, there, is, a, temperature, difference, between, reservoirs, originally, carnot, did, not, distinguish, between, heats, q, h, textstyle, q, mathsf, h, and, q, c, textstyle, q, mathsf, c, as, he, assumed, caloric, theory, to, be, valid, and, hence, that, the, total, heat, in, the, system, was, conserved, but, in, fact, the, magnitude, of, heat, q, h, textstyle, q, mathsf, h, is, greater, than, the, magnitude, of, heat, q, c, textstyle, q, mathsf, c, through, the, efforts, of, clausius, and, kelvin, the, work, w, textstyle, w, done, by, a, reversible, heat, engine, was, found, to, be, the, product, of, the, carnot, efficiency, i, e, the, efficiency, of, all, reversible, heat, engines, with, the, same, pair, of, thermal, reservoirs, and, the, heat, q, h, textstyle, q, mathsf, h, absorbed, by, a, working, body, of, the, engine, during, isothermal, expansion, w, t, h, t, c, t, h, q, h, 1, t, c, t, h, q, h, displaystyle, w, frac, t, mathsf, h, t, mathsf, c, t, mathsf, h, cdot, q, mathsf, h, left, 1, frac, t, mathsf, c, t, mathsf, h, right, q, mathsf, h, to, derive, the, carnot, efficiency, kelvin, had, to, evaluate, the, ratio, of, the, work, output, to, the, heat, absorbed, during, the, isothermal, expansion, with, the, help, of, the, carnot, clapeyron, equation, which, contained, an, unknown, function, called, the, carnot, function, the, possibility, that, the, carnot, function, could, be, the, temperature, as, measured, from, a, zero, point, of, temperature, was, suggested, by, joule, in, a, letter, to, kelvin, this, allowed, kelvin, to, establish, his, absolute, temperature, scale, it, is, known, that, a, work, w, 0, textstyle, w, 0, produced, by, an, engine, over, a, cycle, equals, to, a, net, heat, q, q, h, q, c, textstyle, q, sigma, left, vert, q, mathsf, h, right, vert, left, vert, q, mathsf, c, right, vert, absorbed, over, a, cycle, thus, with, the, sign, convention, for, a, heat, q, textstyle, q, transferred, in, a, thermodynamic, process, q, 0, textstyle, q, 0, for, an, absorption, and, q, 0, textstyle, q, 0, for, a, dissipation, we, get, w, q, w, q, h, q, c, w, q, h, q, c, 0, displaystyle, w, q, sigma, w, left, vert, q, mathsf, h, right, vert, left, vert, q, mathsf, c, right, vert, w, q, mathsf, h, q, mathsf, c, 0, since, this, equality, holds, over, an, entire, carnot, cycle, it, gave, clausius, the, hint, that, at, each, stage, of, the, cycle, the, difference, between, a, work, and, a, net, heat, would, be, conserved, rather, than, a, net, heat, itself, which, means, there, exists, a, state, function, u, textstyle, u, with, a, change, of, d, u, q, d, w, textstyle, mathrm, d, u, delta, q, mathrm, d, w, it, is, called, an, internal, energy, and, forms, a, central, concept, for, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, finally, comparison, for, the, both, representations, of, a, work, output, in, a, carnot, cycle, gives, us, q, h, t, h, q, c, t, c, q, h, t, h, q, c, t, c, 0, displaystyle, frac, left, vert, q, mathsf, h, right, vert, t, mathsf, h, frac, left, vert, q, mathsf, c, right, vert, t, mathsf, c, frac, q, mathsf, h, t, mathsf, h, frac, q, mathsf, c, t, mathsf, c, 0, similarly, to, the, derivation, of, internal, energy, this, equality, implies, existence, of, a, state, function, s, textstyle, s, with, a, change, of, d, s, q, t, textstyle, mathrm, d, s, delta, q, t, and, which, is, conserved, over, an, entire, cycle, clausius, called, this, state, function, entropy, in, addition, the, total, change, of, entropy, in, both, thermal, reservoirs, over, carnot, cycle, is, zero, too, since, the, inversion, of, a, heat, transfer, direction, means, a, sign, inversion, for, the, heat, transferred, during, isothermal, stages, q, h, t, h, q, c, t, c, s, r, h, s, r, c, 0, displaystyle, frac, q, mathsf, h, t, mathsf, h, frac, q, mathsf, c, t, mathsf, c,

textstyle, i, is, either, h, textstyle, mathsf, h, for, a, hot, reservoir, or, c, textstyle, mathsf, c, for, a, cold, one, if, we, consider, a, heat, engine, which, is, less, effective, than, carnot, cycle, i, e, the, work, w, textstyle, w, produced, by, this, engine, is, less, than, the, maximum, predicted, by, carnot, s, theorem, its, work, output, is, capped, by, carnot, efficiency, as, w, 1, t, c, t, h, q, h, displaystyle, w, left, 1, frac, t, mathsf, c, t, mathsf, h, right, q, mathsf, h, substitution, of, the, work, w, textstyle, w, as, the, net, heat, into, the, inequality, above, gives, us, q, h, t, h, q, c, t, c, 0, displaystyle, frac, q, mathsf, h, t, mathsf, h, frac, q, mathsf, c, t, mathsf, c, 0, or, in, terms, of, the, entropy, change, s, r, i, textstyle, delta, s, mathsf, r, i, s, r, h, s, r, c, 0, displaystyle, delta, s, mathsf, r, h, delta, s, mathsf, r, c, 0, a, carnot, cycle, and, an, entropy, as, shown, above, prove, to, be, useful, in, the, study, of, any, classical, thermodynamic, heat, engine, other, cycles, such, as, an, otto, diesel, or, brayton, cycle, could, be, analyzed, from, the, same, standpoint, notably, any, machine, or, cyclic, process, converting, heat, into, work, i, e, heat, engine, what, is, claimed, to, produce, an, efficiency, greater, than, the, one, of, carnot, is, not, viable, due, to, violation, of, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, for, further, analysis, of, sufficiently, discrete, systems, such, as, an, assembly, of, particles, statistical, thermodynamics, must, be, used, additionally, description, of, devices, operating, near, limit, of, de, broglie, waves, e, g, photovoltaic, cells, have, to, be, consistent, with, quantum, statistics, the, thermodynamic, definition, of, entropy, was, developed, in, the, early, 1850s, by, rudolf, clausius, and, essentially, describes, how, to, measure, the, entropy, of, an, isolated, system, in, thermodynamic, equilibrium, with, its, parts, clausius, created, the, term, entropy, as, an, extensive, thermodynamic, variable, that, was, shown, to, be, useful, in, characterizing, the, carnot, cycle, heat, transfer, in, the, isotherm, steps, isothermal, expansion, and, isothermal, compression, of, the, carnot, cycle, was, found, to, be, proportional, to, the, temperature, of, a, system, known, as, its, absolute, temperature, this, relationship, was, expressed, in, an, increment, of, entropy, that, is, equal, to, incremental, heat, transfer, divided, by, temperature, entropy, was, found, to, vary, in, the, thermodynamic, cycle, but, eventually, returned, to, the, same, value, at, the, end, of, every, cycle, thus, it, was, found, to, be, a, function, of, state, specifically, a, thermodynamic, state, of, the, system, while, clausius, based, his, definition, on, a, reversible, process, there, are, also, irreversible, processes, that, change, entropy, following, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, entropy, of, an, isolated, system, always, increases, for, irreversible, processes, the, difference, between, an, isolated, system, and, closed, system, is, that, energy, may, not, flow, to, and, from, an, isolated, system, but, energy, flow, to, and, from, a, closed, system, is, possible, nevertheless, for, both, closed, and, isolated, systems, and, indeed, also, in, open, systems, irreversible, thermodynamics, processes, may, occur, according, to, the, clausius, equality, for, a, reversible, cyclic, thermodynamic, process, q, r, e, v, t, 0, displaystyle, oint, frac, delta, q, mathsf, rev, t, 0, which, means, the, line, integral, l, q, r, e, v, t, textstyle, int, l, delta, q, mathsf, rev, t, is, path, independent, thus, we, can, define, a, state, function, s, textstyle, s, called, entropy, d, s, q, r, e, v, t, displaystyle, mathrm, d, s, frac, delta, q, mathsf, rev, t, therefore, thermodynamic, entropy, has, the, dimension, of, energy, divided, by, temperature, and, the, unit, joule, per, kelvin, j, k, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, to, find, the, entropy, difference, between, any, two, states, of, the, system, the, integral, must, be, evaluated, for, some, reversible, path, between, the, initial, and, final, states, since, an, entropy, is, a, state, function, the, entropy, change, of, the, system, for, an, irreversible, path, is, the, same, as, for, a, reversible, path, between, the, same, two, states, however, the, heat, transferred, to, or, from, the, surroundings, is, different, as, well, as, its, entropy, change, we, can, calculate, the, change, of, entropy, only, by, integrating, the, above, formula, to, obtain, the, absolute, value, of, the, entropy, we, consider, the, third, law, of, thermodynamics, perfect, crystals, at, the, absolute, zero, have, an, entropy, s, 0, textstyle, s, 0, from, a, macroscopic, perspective, in, classical, thermodynamics, the, entropy, is, interpreted, as, a, state, function, of, a, thermodynamic, system, that, is, a, property, depending, only, on, the, current, state, of, the, system, independent, of, how, that, state, came, to, be, achieved, in, any, process, where, the, system, gives, up, e, displaystyle, delta, e, of, energy, to, the, surrounding, at, the, temperature, t, textstyle, t, its, entropy, falls, by, s, textstyle, delta, s, and, at, least, t, s, textstyle, t, cdot, delta, s, of, that, energy, must, be, given, up, to, the, system, s, surroundings, as, a, heat, otherwise, this, process, cannot, go, forward, in, classical, thermodynamics, the, entropy, of, a, system, is, defined, if, and, only, if, it, is, in, a, thermodynamic, equilibrium, though, a, chemical, equilibrium, is, not, required, for, example, the, entropy, of, a, mixture, of, two, moles, of, hydrogen, and, one, mole, of, oxygen, in, standard, conditions, is, well, defined, the, statistical, definition, was, developed, by, ludwig, boltzmann, in, the, 1870s, by, analyzing, the, statistical, behavior, of, the, microscopic, components, of, the, system, boltzmann, showed, that, this, definition, of, entropy, was, equivalent, to, the, thermodynamic, entropy, to, within, a, constant, factor, known, as, the, boltzmann, constant, in, short, the, thermodynamic, definition, of, entropy, provides, the, experimental, verification, of, entropy, while, the, statistical, definition, of, entropy, extends, the, concept, providing, an, explanation, and, a, deeper, understanding, of, its, nature, the, interpretation, of, entropy, in, statistical, mechanics, is, the, measure, of, uncertainty, disorder, or, mixedupness, in, the, phrase, of, gibbs, which, remains, about, a, system, after, its, observable, macroscopic, properties, such, as, temperature, pressure, and, volume, have, been, taken, into, account, for, a, given, set, of, macroscopic, variables, the, entropy, measures, the, degree, to, which, the, probability, of, the, system, is, spread, out, over, different, possible, microstates, in, contrast, to, the, macrostate, which, characterizes, plainly, observable, average, quantities, a, microstate, specifies, all, molecular, details, about, the, system, including, the, position, and, momentum, of, every, molecule, the, more, such, states, are, available, to, the, system, with, appreciable, probability, the, greater, the, entropy, in, statistical, mechanics, entropy, is, a, measure, of, the, number, of, ways, a, system, can, be, arranged, often, taken, to, be, a, measure, of, disorder, the, higher, the, entropy, the, higher, the, disorder, this, definition, describes, the, entropy, as, being, proportional, to, the, natural, logarithm, of, the, number, of, possible, microscopic, configurations, of, the, individual, atoms, and, molecules, of, the, system, microstates, that, could, cause, the, observed, macroscopic, state, macrostate, of, the, system, the, constant, of, proportionality, is, the, boltzmann, constant, the, boltzmann, constant, and, therefore, entropy, have, dimensions, of, energy, divided, by, temperature, which, has, a, unit, of, joules, per, kelvin, j, k, 1, in, the, international, system, of, units, or, kg, m, 2, s, 2, k, 1, in, terms, of, base, units, the, entropy, of, a, substance, is, usually, given, as, an, intensive, property, either, entropy, per, unit, mass, si, unit, j, k, 1, kg, 1, or, entropy, per, unit, amount, of, substance, si, unit, j, k, 1, mol, 1, specifically, entropy, is, a, logarithmic, measure, for, the, system, with, a, number, of, states, each, with, a, probability, p, i, textstyle, p, i, of, being, occupied, usually, given, by, the, boltzmann, distribution, s, k, b, i, p, i, ln, p, i, displaystyle, s, k, mathsf, b, sum, i, p, i, ln, p, i, where, k, b, textstyle, k, mathsf, b, is, the, boltzmann, constant, and, the, summation, is, performed, over, all, possible, microstates, of, the, system, in, case, states, are, defined, in, a, continuous, manner, the, summation, is, replaced, by, an, integral, over, all, possible, states, or, equivalently, we, can, consider, the, expected, value, of, the, logarithm, of, the, probability, that, a, microstate, is, occupied, s, k, b, ln, p, displaystyle, s, k, mathsf, b, left, langle, ln, p, right, rangle, this, definition, assumes, the, basis, states, to, be, picked, in, a, way, that, there, is, no, information, on, their, relative, phases, in, a, general, case, the, expression, is, s, k, b, t, r, ln, displaystyle, s, k, mathsf, b, mathrm, tr, left, hat, rho, times, ln, hat, rho, right, where, textstyle, hat, rho, is, a, density, matrix, t, r, displaystyle, mathrm, tr, is, a, trace, operator, and, ln, displaystyle, ln, is, a, matrix, logarithm, density, matrix, formalism, is, not, required, if, the, system, occurs, to, be, in, a, thermal, equilibrium, so, long, as, the, basis, states, are, chosen, to, be, eigenstates, of, hamiltonian, for, most, practical, purposes, it, can, be, taken, as, the, fundamental, definition, of, entropy, since, all, other, formulae, for, s, textstyle, s, can, be, derived, from, it, but, not, vice, versa, in, what, has, been, called, the, fundamental, postulate, in, statistical, mechanics, among, system, microstates, of, the, same, energy, i, e, degenerate, microstates, each, microstate, is, assumed, to, be, populated, with, equal, probability, p, i, 1, textstyle, p, i, 1, omega, where, textstyle, omega, is, the, number, of, microstates, whose, energy, equals, to, the, one, of, the, system, usually, this, assumption, is, justified, for, an, isolated, system, in, a, thermodynamic, equilibrium, then, in, case, of, an, isolated, system, the, previous, formula, reduces, to, s, k, b, ln, displaystyle, s, k, mathsf, b, ln, omega, in, thermodynamics, such, a, system, is, one, with, a, fixed, volume, number, of, molecules, and, internal, energy, called, a, microcanonical, ensemble, the, most, general, interpretation, of, entropy, is, as, a, measure, of, the, extent, of, uncertainty, about, a, system, the, equilibrium, state, of, a, system, maximizes, the, entropy, because, it, does, not, reflect, all, information, about, the, initial, conditions, except, for, the, conserved, variables, this, uncertainty, is, not, of, the, everyday, subjective, kind, but, rather, the, uncertainty, inherent, to, the, experimental, method, and, interpretative, model, the, interpretative, model, has, a, central, role, in, determining, entropy, the, qualifier, for, a, given, set, of, macroscopic, variables, above, has, deep, implications, when, two, observers, use, different, sets, of, macroscopic, variables, for, example, let, s, consider, observer, a, using, variables, u, textstyle, u, v, textstyle, v, w, textstyle, w, and, observer, b, using, variables, u, textstyle, u, v, textstyle, v, w, textstyle, w, x, textstyle, x, if, observer, b, changes, variable, x, textstyle, x, then, observer, a, will, see, a, violation, of, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, since, he, does, not, posses, information, about, variable, x, textstyle, x, and, its, influence, on, the, system, in, other, words, one, must, choose, a, complete, set, of, macroscopic, variables, to, describe, the, system, i, e, every, independent, parameter, that, may, change, during, experiment, entropy, can, also, be, defined, for, any, markov, processes, with, reversible, dynamics, and, the, detailed, balance, property, in, boltzmann, s, 1896, lectures, on, gas, theory, he, showed, that, this, expression, gives, a, measure, of, entropy, for, systems, of, atoms, and, molecules, in, the, gas, phase, thus, providing, a, measure, for, the, entropy, of, classical, thermodynamics, entropy, arises, directly, from, the, carnot, cycle, it, can, also, be, described, as, the, reversible, heat, divided, by, temperature, entropy, is, a, fundamental, function, of, state, in, a, thermodynamic, system, pressure, and, temperature, tend, to, become, uniform, over, time, because, the, equilibrium, state, has, higher, probability, more, possible, combinations, of, microstates, than, any, other, state, as, an, example, for, a, glass, of, ice, water, in, air, at, room, temperature, the, difference, in, temperature, between, the, warm, room, the, surroundings, and, the, cold, glass, of, ice, and, water, the, system, and, not, part, of, the, room, decreases, as, portions, of, the, thermal, energy, from, the, warm, surroundings, spread, to, the, cooler, system, of, ice, and, water, over, time, the, temperature, of, the, glass, and, its, contents, and, the, temperature, of, the, room, become, equal, in, other, words, the, entropy, of, the, room, has, decreased, as, some, of, its, energy, has, been, dispersed, to, the, ice, and, water, of, which, the, entropy, has, increased, however, as, calculated, in, the, example, the, entropy, of, the, system, of, ice, and, water, has, increased, more, than, the, entropy, of, the, surrounding, room, has, decreased, in, an, isolated, system, such, as, the, room, and, ice, water, taken, together, the, dispersal, of, energy, from, warmer, to, cooler, always, results, in, a, net, increase, in, entropy, thus, when, the, universe, of, the, room, and, ice, water, system, has, reached, a, temperature, equilibrium, the, entropy, change, from, the, initial, state, is, at, a, maximum, the, entropy, of, the, thermodynamic, system, is, a, measure, of, how, far, the, equalization, has, progressed, thermodynamic, entropy, is, a, non, conserved, state, function, that, is, of, great, importance, in, the, sciences, of, physics, and, chemistry, historically, the, concept, of, entropy, evolved, to, explain, why, some, processes, permitted, by, conservation, laws, occur, spontaneously, while, their, time, reversals, also, permitted, by, conservation, laws, do, not, systems, tend, to, progress, in, the, direction, of, increasing, entropy, for, isolated, systems, entropy, never, decreases, this, fact, has, several, important, consequences, in, science, first, it, prohibits, perpetual, motion, machines, and, second, it, implies, the, arrow, of, entropy, has, the, same, direction, as, the, arrow, of, time, increases, in, the, total, entropy, of, system, and, surroundings, correspond, to, irreversible, changes, because, some, energy, is, expended, as, waste, heat, limiting, the, amount, of, work, a, system, can, do, unlike, many, other, functions, of, state, entropy, cannot, be, directly, observed, but, must, be, calculated, absolute, standard, molar, entropy, of, a, substance, can, be, calculated, from, the, measured, temperature, dependence, of, its, heat, capacity, the, molar, entropy, of, ions, is, obtained, as, a, difference, in, entropy, from, a, reference, state, defined, as, zero, entropy, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, states, that, the, entropy, of, an, isolated, system, must, increase, or, remain, constant, therefore, entropy, is, not, a, conserved, quantity, for, example, in, an, isolated, system, with, non, uniform, temperature, heat, might, irreversibly, flow, and, the, temperature, become, more, uniform, such, that, entropy, increases, chemical, reactions, cause, changes, in, entropy, and, system, entropy, in, conjunction, with, enthalpy, plays, an, important, role, in, determining, in, which, direction, a, chemical, reaction, spontaneously, proceeds, one, dictionary, definition, of, entropy, is, that, it, is, a, measure, of, thermal, energy, per, unit, temperature, that, is, not, available, for, useful, work, in, a, cyclic, process, for, instance, a, substance, at, uniform, temperature, is, at, maximum, entropy, and, cannot, drive, a, heat, engine, a, substance, at, non, uniform, temperature, is, at, a, lower, entropy, than, if, the, heat, distribution, is, allowed, to, even, out, and, some, of, the, thermal, energy, can, drive, a, heat, engine, a, special, case, of, entropy, increase, the, entropy, of, mixing, occurs, when, two, or, more, different, substances, are, mixed, if, the, substances, are, at, the, same, temperature, and, pressure, there, is, no, net, exchange, of, heat, or, work, the, entropy, change, is, entirely, due, to, the, mixing, of, the, different, substances, at, a, statistical, mechanical, level, this, results, due, to, the, change, in, available, volume, per, particle, with, mixing, proofs, of, equivalence, between, the, entropy, in, statistical, mechanics, the, gibbs, entropy, formula, s, k, b, i, p, i, ln, p, i, displaystyle, s, k, mathsf, b, sum, i, p, i, ln, p, i, and, the, entropy, in, classical, thermodynamics, d, s, q, r, e, v, t, displaystyle, mathrm, d, s, frac, delta, q, mathsf, rev, t, together, with, the, fundamental, thermodynamic, relation, are, known, for, the, microcanonical, ensemble, the, canonical, ensemble, the, grand, canonical, ensemble, and, the, isothermal, isobaric, ensemble, these, proofs, are, based, on, the, probability, density, of, microstates, of, the, generalized, boltzmann, distribution, and, the, identification, of, the, thermodynamic, internal, energy, as, the, ensemble, average, u, e, i, textstyle, u, left, langle, e, i, right, rangle, thermodynamic, relations, are, then, employed, to, derive, the, well, known, gibbs, entropy, formula, however, the, equivalence, between, the, gibbs, entropy, formula, and, the, thermodynamic, definition, of, entropy, is, not, a, fundamental, thermodynamic, relation, but, rather, a, consequence, of, the, form, of, the, generalized, boltzmann, distribution, furthermore, it, has, been, shown, that, the, definitions, of, entropy, in, statistical, mechanics, is, the, only, entropy, that, is, equivalent, to, the, classical, thermodynamics, entropy, under, the, following, postulates, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, requires, that, in, general, the, total, entropy, of, any, system, does, not, decrease, other, than, by, increasing, the, entropy, of, some, other, system, hence, in, a, system, isolated, from, its, environment, the, entropy, of, that, system, tends, not, to, decrease, it, follows, that, heat, cannot, flow, from, a, colder, body, to, a, hotter, body, without, the, application, of, work, to, the, colder, body, secondly, it, is, impossible, for, any, device, operating, on, a, cycle, to, produce, net, work, from, a, single, temperature, reservoir, the, production, of, net, work, requires, flow, of, heat, from, a, hotter, reservoir, to, a, colder, reservoir, or, a, single, expanding, reservoir, undergoing, adiabatic, cooling, which, performs, adiabatic, work, as, a, result, there, is, no, possibility, of, a, perpetual, motion, machine, it, follows, that, a, reduction, in, the, increase, of, entropy, in, a, specified, process, such, as, a, chemical, reaction, means, that, it, is, energetically, more, efficient, it, follows, from, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, that, the, entropy, of, a, system, that, is, not, isolated, may, decrease, an, air, conditioner, for, example, may, cool, the, air, in, a, room, thus, reducing, the, entropy, of, the, air, of, that, system, the, heat, expelled, from, the, room, the, system, which, the, air, conditioner, transports, and, discharges, to, the, outside, air, always, makes, a, bigger, contribution, to, the, entropy, of, the, environment, than, the, decrease, of, the, entropy, of, the, air, of, that, system, thus, the, total, of, entropy, of, the, room, plus, the, entropy, of, the, environment, increases, in, agreement, with, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, in, mechanics, the, second, law, in, conjunction, with, the, fundamental, thermodynamic, relation, places, limits, on, a, system, s, ability, to, do, useful, work, the, entropy, change, of, a, system, at, temperature, t, textstyle, t, absorbing, an, infinitesimal, amount, of, heat, q, textstyle, delta, q, in, a, reversible, way, is, given, by, q, t, textstyle, delta, q, t, more, explicitly, an, energy, t, r, s, textstyle, t, r, s, is, not, available, to, do, useful, work, where, t, r, textstyle, t, r, is, the, temperature, of, the, coldest, accessible, reservoir, or, heat, sink, external, to, the, system, for, further, discussion, see, exergy, statistical, mechanics, demonstrates, that, entropy, is, governed, by, probability, thus, allowing, for, a, decrease, in, disorder, even, in, an, isolated, system, although, this, is, possible, such, an, event, has, a, small, probability, of, occurring, making, it, unlikely, the, applicability, of, a, second, law, of, thermodynamics, is, limited, to, systems, in, or, sufficiently, near, equilibrium, state, so, that, they, have, defined, entropy, some, inhomogeneous, systems, out, of, thermodynamic, equilibrium, still, satisfy, the, hypothesis, of, local, thermodynamic, equilibrium, so, that, entropy, density, is, locally, defined, as, an, intensive, quantity, for, such, systems, there, may, apply, a, principle, of, maximum, time, rate, of, entropy, production, it, states, that, such, a, system, may, evolve, to, a, steady, state, that, maximizes, its, time, rate, of, entropy, production, this, does, not, mean, that, such, a, system, is, necessarily, always, in, a, condition, of, maximum, time, rate, of, entropy, production, it, means, that, it, may, evolve, to, such, a, steady, state, the, entropy, of, a, system, depends, on, its, internal, energy, and, its, external, parameters, such, as, its, volume, in, the, thermodynamic, limit, this, fact, leads, to, an, equation, relating, the, change, in, the, internal, energy, u, textstyle, u, to, changes, in, the, entropy, and, the, external, parameters, this, relation, is, known, as, the, fundamental, thermodynamic, relation, if, external, pressure, p, textstyle, p, bears, on, the, volume, v, textstyle, v, as, the, only, external, parameter, this, relation, is, d, u, t, d, s, p, d, v, displaystyle, mathrm, d, u, t, mathrm, d, s, p, mathrm, d, v, since, both, internal, energy, and, entropy, are, monotonic, functions, of, temperature, t, textstyle, t, implying, that, the, internal, energy, is, fixed, when, one, specifies, the, entropy, and, the, volume, this, relation, is, valid, even, if, the, change, from, one, state, of, thermal, equilibrium, to, another, with, infinitesimally, larger, entropy, and, volume, happens, in, a, non, quasistatic, way, so, during, this, change, the, system, may, be, very, far, out, of, thermal, equilibrium, and, then, the, whole, system, entropy, pressure, and, temperature, may, not, exist, the, fundamental, thermodynamic, relation, implies, many, thermodynamic, identities, that, are, valid, in, general, independent, of, the, microscopic, details, of, the, system, important, examples, are, the, maxwell, relations, and, the, relations, between, heat, capacities, thermodynamic, entropy, is, central, in, chemical, thermodynamics, enabling, changes, to, be, quantified, and, the, outcome, of, reactions, predicted, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, states, that, entropy, in, an, isolated, system, the, combination, of, a, subsystem, under, study, and, its, surroundings, increases, during, all, spontaneous, chemical, and, physical, processes, the, clausius, equation, introduces, the, measurement, of, entropy, change, which, describes, the, direction, and, quantifies, the, magnitude, of, simple, changes, such, as, heat, transfer, between, systems, always, from, hotter, body, to, cooler, one, spontaneously, thermodynamic, entropy, is, an, extensive, property, meaning, that, it, scales, with, the, size, or, extent, of, a, system, in, many, processes, it, is, useful, to, specify, the, entropy, as, an, intensive, property, independent, of, the, size, as, a, specific, entropy, characteristic, of, the, type, of, system, studied, specific, entropy, may, be, expressed, relative, to, a, unit, of, mass, typically, the, kilogram, unit, j, kg, 1, k, 1, alternatively, in, chemistry, it, is, also, referred, to, one, mole, of, substance, in, which, case, it, is, called, the, molar, entropy, with, a, unit, of, j, mol, 1, k, 1, thus, when, one, mole, of, substance, at, about, 0, k, is, warmed, by, its, surroundings, to, 298, k, the, sum, of, the, incremental, values, of, q, r, e, v, t, textstyle, q, mathsf, rev, t, constitute, each, element, s, or, compound, s, standard, molar, entropy, an, indicator, of, the, amount, of, energy, stored, by, a, substance, at, 298, k, entropy, change, also, measures, the, mixing, of, substances, as, a, summation, of, their, relative, quantities, in, the, final, mixture, entropy, is, equally, essential, in, predicting, the, extent, and, direction, of, complex, chemical, reactions, for, such, applications, s, textstyle,

across, the, system, boundaries, they, also, influence, the, total, entropy, of, the, system, this, account, in, terms, of, heat, and, work, is, valid, only, for, cases, in, which, the, work, and, heat, transfers, are, by, paths, physically, distinct, from, the, paths, of, entry, and, exit, of, matter, from, the, system, to, derive, a, generalized, entropy, balanced, equation, we, start, with, the, general, balance, equation, for, the, change, in, any, extensive, quantity, textstyle, theta, in, a, thermodynamic, system, a, quantity, that, may, be, either, conserved, such, as, energy, or, non, conserved, such, as, entropy, the, basic, generic, balance, expression, states, that, d, d, t, textstyle, mathrm, d, theta, mathrm, d, t, i, e, the, rate, of, change, of, textstyle, theta, in, the, system, equals, the, rate, at, which, textstyle, theta, enters, the, system, at, the, boundaries, minus, the, rate, at, which, textstyle, theta, leaves, the, system, across, the, system, boundaries, plus, the, rate, at, which, textstyle, theta, is, generated, within, the, system, for, an, open, thermodynamic, system, in, which, heat, and, work, are, transferred, by, paths, separate, from, the, paths, for, transfer, of, matter, using, this, generic, balance, equation, with, respect, to, the, rate, of, change, with, time, t, textstyle, t, of, the, extensive, quantity, entropy, s,

transfer, or, frictional, effects, such, as, viscosity, in, case, of, multiple, heat, flows, the, term, q, t, textstyle, dot, q, t, is, replaced, by, j, q, j, t, j, textstyle, sum, j, dot, q, j, t, j, where, q, j, textstyle, dot, q, j, is, the, heat, flow, through, j, textstyle, j, th, port, into, the, system, and, t, j, textstyle, t, j, is, the, temperature, at, the, j, textstyle, j, th, port, the, nomenclature, entropy, balance, is, misleading, and, often, deemed, inappropriate, because, entropy, is, not, a, conserved, quantity, in, other, words, the, term, s, g, e, n, textstyle, dot, s, mathsf, gen, is, never, a, known, quantity, but, always, a, derived, one, based, on, the, expression, above, therefore, the, open, system, version, of, the, second, law, is, more, appropriately, described, as, the, entropy, generation, equation, since, it, specifies, that, s, g, e, n, 0, displaystyle, dot, s, mathsf, gen, geq, 0, with, zero, for, reversible, process, and, positive, values, for, irreversible, one, for, certain, simple, transformations, in, systems, of, constant, composition, the, entropy, changes, are, given, by, simple, formulas, for, the, expansion, or, compression, of, an, ideal, gas, from, an, initial, volume, v, 0, textstyle, v, 0, and, pressure, p, 0, textstyle, p, 0, to, a, final, volume, v, textstyle, v, and, pressure, p, textstyle, p, at, any, constant,

amount, of, gas, in, moles, and, r, textstyle, r, is, the, ideal, gas, constant, these, equations, also, apply, for, expansion, into, a, finite, vacuum, or, a, throttling, process, where, the, temperature, internal, energy, and, enthalpy, for, an, ideal, gas, remain, constant, for, pure, heating, or, cooling, of, any, system, gas, liquid, or, solid, at, constant, pressure, from, an, initial, temperature, t, 0, textstyle, t, 0, to, a, final, temperature, t, textstyle, t, the, entropy, change, is, provided, that, the, constant, pressure, molar, heat, capacity, or, specific, heat, c, p, textstyle, c, mathrm, p, is, constant, and, that, no, phase, transition, occurs, in, this, temperature, interval, similarly, at, constant, volume, the, entropy, change, is, s, n, c, v, ln, t, t,

low, temperatures, near, absolute, zero, heat, capacities, of, solids, quickly, drop, off, to, near, zero, so, the, assumption, of, constant, heat, capacity, does, not, apply, since, entropy, is, a, state, function, the, entropy, change, of, any, process, in, which, temperature, and, volume, both, vary, is, the, same, as, for, a, path, divided, into, two, steps, heating, at, constant, volume, and, expansion, at, constant, temperature, for, an, ideal, gas, the, total, entropy, change, is, s, n, c, v, ln, t, t, 0, n, r, ln, v, v, 0, displaystyle, delta, s, nc, mathrm, v, ln, frac, t, t, 0,

entropy, of, fusion, is, s, f, u, s, h, f, u, s, t, m, displaystyle, delta, s, mathsf, fus, frac, delta, h, mathsf, fus, t, mathsf, m, similarly, for, vaporization, of, a, liquid, to, a, gas, at, the, boiling, point, t, b, displaystyle, t, mathsf, b, the, entropy, of, vaporization, is, s, v, a, p, h, v, a, p, t, b, displaystyle, delta, s, mathsf, vap, frac, delta, h, mathsf, vap, t, mathsf, b, as, a, fundamental, aspect, of, thermodynamics, and, physics, several, different, approaches, to, entropy, beyond, that, of, clausius, and, boltzmann, are, valid, the, following, is, a, list, of, additional, definitions, of, entropy, from, a, collection, of, textbooks, in, boltzmann, s, analysis, in, terms, of, constituent, particles, entropy, is, a, measure, of, the, number, of, possible, microscopic, states, or, microstates, of, a, system, in, thermodynamic, equilibrium, entropy, is, often, loosely, associated, with, the, amount, of, order, or, disorder, or, of, chaos, in, a, thermodynamic, system, the, traditional, qualitative, description, of, entropy, is, that, it, refers, to, changes, in, the, state, of, the, system, and, is, a, measure, of, molecular, disorder, and, the, amount, of, wasted, energy, in, a, dynamical, energy, transformation, from, one, state, or, form, to, another, in, this, direction, several, recent, authors, have, derived, exact, entropy, formulas, to, account, for, and, measure, disorder, and, order, in, atomic, and, molecular, assemblies, one, of, the, simpler, entropy, order, disorder, formulas, is, that, derived, in, 1984, by, thermodynamic, physicist, peter, landsberg, based, on, a, combination, of, thermodynamics, and, information, theory, arguments, he, argues, that, when, constraints, operate, on, a, system, such, that, it, is, prevented, from, entering, one, or, more, of, its, possible, or, permitted, states, as, contrasted, with, its, forbidden, states, the, measure, of, the, total, amount, of, disorder, in, the, system, is, given, by, d, i, s, o, r, d, e, r, c, d, c, i, displaystyle, mathsf, disorder, frac, c, mathsf, d, c, mathsf, i, similarly, the, total, amount, of, order, in, the, system, is, given, by, o, r, d, e, r, 1, c, o, c, i, displaystyle, mathsf, order, 1, frac, c, mathsf, o, c, mathsf, i, in, which, c, d, textstyle, c, mathsf, d, is, the, disorder, capacity, of, the, system, which, is, the, entropy, of, the, parts, contained, in, the, permitted, ensemble, c, i, textstyle, c, mathsf, i, is, the, information, capacity, of, the, system, an, expression, similar, to, shannon, s, channel, capacity, and, c, o, textstyle, c, mathsf, o, is, the, order, capacity, of, the, system, the, concept, of, entropy, can, be, described, qualitatively, as, a, measure, of, energy, dispersal, at, a, specific, temperature, similar, terms, have, been, in, use, from, early, in, the, history, of, classical, thermodynamics, and, with, the, development, of, statistical, thermodynamics, and, quantum, theory, entropy, changes, have, been, described, in, terms, of, the, mixing, or, spreading, of, the, total, energy, of, each, constituent, of, a, system, over, its, particular, quantized, energy, levels, ambiguities, in, the, terms, disorder, and, chaos, which, usually, have, meanings, directly, opposed, to, equilibrium, contribute, to, widespread, confusion, and, hamper, comprehension, of, entropy, for, most, students, as, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, shows, in, an, isolated, system, internal, portions, at, different, temperatures, tend, to, adjust, to, a, single, uniform, temperature, and, thus, produce, equilibrium, a, recently, developed, educational, approach, avoids, ambiguous, terms, and, describes, such, spreading, out, of, energy, as, dispersal, which, leads, to, loss, of, the, differentials, required, for, work, even, though, the, total, energy, remains, constant, in, accordance, with, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, compare, discussion, in, next, section, physical, chemist, peter, atkins, in, his, textbook, physical, chemistry, introduces, entropy, with, the, statement, that, spontaneous, changes, are, always, accompanied, by, a, dispersal, of, energy, or, matter, and, often, both, it, is, possible, in, a, thermal, context, to, regard, lower, entropy, as, a, measure, of, the, effectiveness, or, usefulness, of, a, particular, quantity, of, energy, energy, supplied, at, a, higher, temperature, i, e, with, low, entropy, tends, to, be, more, useful, than, the, same, amount, of, energy, available, at, a, lower, temperature, mixing, a, hot, parcel, of, a, fluid, with, a, cold, one, produces, a, parcel, of, intermediate, temperature, in, which, the, overall, increase, in, entropy, represents, a, loss, that, can, never, be, replaced, as, the, entropy, of, the, universe, is, steadily, increasing, its, total, energy, is, becoming, less, useful, eventually, this, is, theorized, to, lead, to, the, heat, death, of, the, universe, a, definition, of, entropy, based, entirely, on, the, relation, of, adiabatic, accessibility, between, equilibrium, states, was, given, by, e, h, lieb, and, j, yngvason, in, 1999, this, approach, has, several, predecessors, including, the, pioneering, work, of, constantin, carath, odory, from, 1909, and, the, monograph, by, r, giles, in, the, setting, of, lieb, and, yngvason, one, starts, by, picking, for, a, unit, amount, of, the, substance, under, consideration, two, reference, states, x, 0, textstyle, x, 0, and, x, 1, textstyle, x, 1, such, that, the, latter, is, adiabatically, accessible, from, the, former, but, not, conversely, defining, the, entropies, of, the, reference, states, to, be, 0, and, 1, respectively, the, entropy, of, a, state, x, textstyle, x, is, defined, as, the, largest, number, textstyle, lambda, such, that, x, textstyle, x, is, adiabatically, accessible, from, a, composite, state, consisting, of, an, amount, textstyle, lambda, in, the, state, x, 1, textstyle, x, 1, and, a, complementary, amount, 1, textstyle, 1, lambda, in, the, state, x, 0, textstyle, x, 0, a, simple, but, important, result, within, this, setting, is, that, entropy, is, uniquely, determined, apart, from, a, choice, of, unit, and, an, additive, constant, for, each, chemical, element, by, the, following, properties, it, is, monotonic, with, respect, to, the, relation, of, adiabatic, accessibility, additive, on, composite, systems, and, extensive, under, scaling, in, quantum, statistical, mechanics, the, concept, of, entropy, was, developed, by, john, von, neumann, and, is, generally, referred, to, as, von, neumann, entropy, s, k, b, t, r, ln, displaystyle, s, k, mathsf, b, mathrm, tr, left, hat, rho, times, ln, hat, rho, right, where, textstyle, hat, rho, is, the, density, matrix, t, r, textstyle, mathrm, tr, is, the, trace, operator, and, k, b, textstyle, k, mathsf, b, is, the, boltzmann, constant, this, upholds, the, correspondence, principle, because, in, the, classical, limit, when, the, phases, between, the, basis, states, are, purely, random, this, expression, is, equivalent, to, the, familiar, classical, definition, of, entropy, for, states, with, classical, probabilities, p, i, textstyle, p, i, s, k, b, i, p, i, ln, p, i, displaystyle, s, k, mathsf, b, sum, i, p, i, ln, p, i, i, e, in, such, a, basis, the, density, matrix, is, diagonal, von, neumann, established, a, rigorous, mathematical, framework, for, quantum, mechanics, with, his, work, mathematische, grundlagen, der, quantenmechanik, he, provided, in, this, work, a, theory, of, measurement, where, the, usual, notion, of, wave, function, collapse, is, described, as, an, irreversible, process, the, so, called, von, neumann, or, projective, measurement, using, this, concept, in, conjunction, with, the, density, matrix, he, extended, the, classical, concept, of, entropy, into, the, quantum, domain, i, thought, of, calling, it, information, but, the, word, was, overly, used, so, i, decided, to, call, it, uncertainty, von, neumann, told, me, you, should, call, it, entropy, for, two, reasons, in, the, first, place, your, uncertainty, function, has, been, used, in, statistical, mechanics, under, that, name, so, it, already, has, a, name, in, the, second, place, and, more, important, nobody, knows, what, entropy, really, is, so, in, a, debate, you, will, always, have, the, advantage, conversation, between, claude, shannon, and, john, von, neumann, regarding, what, name, to, give, to, the, attenuation, in, phone, line, signals, when, viewed, in, terms, of, information, theory, the, entropy, state, function, is, the, amount, of, information, in, the, system, that, is, needed, to, fully, specify, the, microstate, of, the, system, entropy, is, the, measure, of, the, amount, of, missing, information, before, reception, often, called, shannon, entropy, it, was, originally, devised, by, claude, shannon, in, 1948, to, study, the, size, of, information, of, a, transmitted, message, the, definition, of, information, entropy, is, expressed, in, terms, of, a, discrete, set, of, probabilities, p, i, textstyle, p, i, so, that, h, x, i, 1, n, p, x, i, log, p, x, i, displaystyle, h, x, sum, i, 1, n, p, x, i, log, p, x, i, where, the, base, of, the, logarithm, determines, the, units, for, example, the, binary, logarithm, corresponds, to, bits, in, the, case, of, transmitted, messages, these, probabilities, were, the, probabilities, that, a, particular, message, was, actually, transmitted, and, the, entropy, of, the, message, system, was, a, measure, of, the, average, size, of, information, of, a, message, for, the, case, of, equal, probabilities, i, e, each, message, is, equally, probable, the, shannon, entropy, in, bits, is, just, the, number, of, binary, questions, needed, to, determine, the, content, of, the, message, most, researchers, consider, information, entropy, and, thermodynamic, entropy, directly, linked, to, the, same, concept, while, others, argue, that, they, are, distinct, both, expressions, are, mathematically, similar, if, w, textstyle, w, is, the, number, of, microstates, that, can, yield, a, given, macrostate, and, each, microstate, has, the, same, a, priori, probability, then, that, probability, is, p, 1, w, textstyle, p, 1, w, the, shannon, entropy, in, nats, is, h, i, 1, w, p, i, ln, p, i, ln, w, displaystyle, h, sum, i, 1, w, p, i, ln, p, i, ln, w, and, if, entropy, is, measured, in, units, of, k, textstyle, k, per, nat, then, the, entropy, is, given, by, h, k, ln, w, displaystyle, h, k, ln, w, which, is, the, boltzmann, entropy, formula, where, k, textstyle, k, is, the, boltzmann, constant, which, may, be, interpreted, as, the, thermodynamic, entropy, per, nat, some, authors, argue, for, dropping, the, word, entropy, for, the, h, textstyle, h, function, of, information, theory, and, using, shannon, s, other, term, uncertainty, instead, the, entropy, of, a, substance, can, be, measured, although, in, an, indirect, way, the, measurement, known, as, entropymetry, is, done, on, a, closed, system, with, constant, number, of, particles, n, textstyle, n, and, constant, volume, v, textstyle, v, and, it, uses, the, definition, of, temperature, in, terms, of, entropy, while, limiting, energy, exchange, to, heat, d, u, d, q, textstyle, mathrm, d, u, rightarrow, mathrm, d, q, t, u, s, v, n, d, s, d, q, t, displaystyle, t, left, frac, partial, u, partial, s, right, v, n, rightarrow, cdots, rightarrow, mathrm, d, s, frac, mathrm, d, q, t, the, resulting, relation, describes, how, entropy, changes, d, s, textstyle, mathrm, d, s, when, a, small, amount, of, energy, d, q, textstyle, mathrm, d, q, is, introduced, into, the, system, at, a, certain, temperature, t, textstyle, t, the, process, of, measurement, goes, as, follows, first, a, sample, of, the, substance, is, cooled, as, close, to, absolute, zero, as, possible, at, such, temperatures, the, entropy, approaches, zero, due, to, the, definition, of, temperature, then, small, amounts, of, heat, are, introduced, into, the, sample, and, the, change, in, temperature, is, recorded, until, the, temperature, reaches, a, desired, value, usually, 25, c, the, obtained, data, allows, the, user, to, integrate, the, equation, above, yielding, the, absolute, value, of, entropy, of, the, substance, at, the, final, temperature, this, value, of, entropy, is, called, calorimetric, entropy, although, the, concept, of, entropy, was, originally, a, thermodynamic, concept, it, has, been, adapted, in, other, fields, of, study, including, information, theory, psychodynamics, thermoeconomics, ecological, economics, and, evolution, entropy, is, the, only, quantity, in, the, physical, sciences, that, seems, to, imply, a, particular, direction, of, progress, sometimes, called, an, arrow, of, time, as, time, progresses, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, states, that, the, entropy, of, an, isolated, system, never, decreases, in, large, systems, over, significant, periods, of, time, hence, from, this, perspective, entropy, measurement, is, thought, of, as, a, clock, in, these, conditions, chiavazzo, et, al, proposed, that, where, cave, spiders, choose, to, lay, their, eggs, can, be, explained, through, entropy, minimization, entropy, has, been, proven, useful, in, the, analysis, of, base, pair, sequences, in, dna, many, entropy, based, measures, have, been, shown, to, distinguish, between, different, structural, regions, of, the, genome, differentiate, between, coding, and, non, coding, regions, of, dna, and, can, also, be, applied, for, the, recreation, of, evolutionary, trees, by, determining, the, evolutionary, distance, between, different, species, assuming, that, a, finite, universe, is, an, isolated, system, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, states, that, its, total, entropy, is, continually, increasing, it, has, been, speculated, since, the, 19th, century, that, the, universe, is, fated, to, a, heat, death, in, which, all, the, energy, ends, up, as, a, homogeneous, distribution, of, thermal, energy, so, that, no, more, work, can, be, extracted, from, any, source, if, the, universe, can, be, considered, to, have, generally, increasing, entropy, then, as, roger, penrose, has, pointed, out, gravity, plays, an, important, role, in, the, increase, because, gravity, causes, dispersed, matter, to, accumulate, into, stars, which, collapse, eventually, into, black, holes, the, entropy, of, a, black, hole, is, proportional, to, the, surface, area, of, the, black, hole, s, event, horizon, jacob, bekenstein, and, stephen, hawking, have, shown, that, black, holes, have, the, maximum, possible, entropy, of, any, object, of, equal, size, this, makes, them, likely, end, points, of, all, entropy, increasing, processes, if, they, are, totally, effective, matter, and, energy, traps, however, the, escape, of, energy, from, black, holes, might, be, possible, due, to, quantum, activity, see, hawking, radiation, the, role, of, entropy, in, cosmology, remains, a, controversial, subject, since, the, time, of, ludwig, boltzmann, recent, work, has, cast, some, doubt, on, the, heat, death, hypothesis, and, the, applicability, of, any, simple, thermodynamic, model, to, the, universe, in, general, although, entropy, does, increase, in, the, model, of, an, expanding, universe, the, maximum, possible, entropy, rises, much, more, rapidly, moving, the, universe, further, from, the, heat, death, with, time, not, closer, this, results, in, an, entropy, gap, pushing, the, system, further, away, from, the, posited, heat, death, equilibrium, other, complicating, factors, such, as, the, energy, density, of, the, vacuum, and, macroscopic, quantum, effects, are, difficult, to, reconcile, with, thermodynamical, models, making, any, predictions, of, large, scale, thermodynamics, extremely, difficult, current, theories, suggest, the, entropy, gap, to, have, been, originally, opened, up, by, the, early, rapid, exponential, expansion, of, the, universe, romanian, american, economist, nicholas, georgescu, roegen, a, progenitor, in, economics, and, a, paradigm, founder, of, ecological, economics, made, extensive, use, of, the, entropy, concept, in, his, magnum, opus, on, the, entropy, law, and, the, economic, process, due, to, georgescu, roegen, s, work, the, laws, of, thermodynamics, form, an, integral, part, of, the, ecological, economics, school, 204f, 29, 35, although, his, work, was, blemished, somewhat, by, mistakes, a, full, chapter, on, the, economics, of, georgescu, roegen, has, approvingly, been, included, in, one, elementary, physics, textbook, on, the, historical, development, of, thermodynamics, 95, 112, in, economics, georgescu, roegen, s, work, has, generated, the, term, entropy, pessimism, 116, since, the, 1990s, leading, ecological, economist, and, steady, state, theorist, herman, daly, a, student, of, georgescu, roegen, has, been, the, economics, profession, s, most, influential, proponent, of, the, entropy, pessimism, position, 545f
