the, electromagnetic, spectrum, is, the, full, range, of, electromagnetic, radiation, organized, by, frequency, or, wavelength, the, spectrum, is, divided, into, separate, bands, with, different, names, for, the, electromagnetic, waves, within, each, band, from, low, to, high, frequency, these, are, radio, waves, microwaves, infrared, visible, light, ultraviolet, x, rays, and, gamma, rays, the, electromagnetic, waves, in, each, of, these, bands, have, different, characteristics, such, as, how, they, are, produced, how, they, interact, with, matter, and, their, practical, applications, radio, waves, at, the, low, frequency, end, of, the, spectrum, have, the, lowest, photon, energy, and, the, longest, wavelengths, thousands, of, kilometers, or, more, they, can, be, emitted, and, received, by, antennas, and, pass, through, the, atmosphere, foliage, and, most, building, materials, gamma, rays, at, the, high, frequency, end, of, the, spectrum, have, the, highest, photon, energies, and, the, shortest, wavelengths, much, smaller, than, an, atomic, nucleus, gamma, rays, x, rays, and, extreme, ultraviolet, rays, are, called, ionizing, radiation, because, their, high, photon, energy, is, able, to, ionize, atoms, causing, chemical, reactions, longer, wavelength, radiation, such, as, visible, light, is, nonionizing, the, photons, do, not, have, sufficient, energy, to, ionize, atoms, throughout, most, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, spectroscopy, can, be, used, to, separate, waves, of, different, frequencies, so, that, the, intensity, of, the, radiation, can, be, measured, as, a, function, of, frequency, or, wavelength, spectroscopy, is, used, to, study, the, interactions, of, electromagnetic, waves, with, matter, humans, have, always, been, aware, of, visible, light, and, radiant, heat, but, for, most, of, history, it, was, not, known, that, these, phenomena, were, connected, or, were, representatives, of, a, more, extensive, principle, the, ancient, greeks, recognized, that, light, traveled, in, straight, lines, and, studied, some, of, its, properties, including, reflection, and, refraction, light, was, intensively, studied, from, the, beginning, of, the, 17th, century, leading, to, the, invention, of, important, instruments, like, the, telescope, and, microscope, isaac, newton, was, the, first, to, use, the, term, spectrum, for, the, range, of, colours, that, white, light, could, be, split, into, with, a, prism, starting, in, 1666, newton, showed, that, these, colours, were, intrinsic, to, light, and, could, be, recombined, into, white, light, a, debate, arose, over, whether, light, had, a, wave, nature, or, a, particle, nature, with, ren, descartes, robert, hooke, and, christiaan, huygens, favouring, a, wave, description, and, newton, favouring, a, particle, description, huygens, in, particular, had, a, well, developed, theory, from, which, he, was, able, to, derive, the, laws, of, reflection, and, refraction, around, 1801, thomas, young, measured, the, wavelength, of, a, light, beam, with, his, two, slit, experiment, thus, conclusively, demonstrating, that, light, was, a, wave, in, 1800, william, herschel, discovered, infrared, radiation, he, was, studying, the, temperature, of, different, colours, by, moving, a, thermometer, through, light, split, by, a, prism, he, noticed, that, the, highest, temperature, was, beyond, red, he, theorized, that, this, temperature, change, was, due, to, calorific, rays, a, type, of, light, ray, that, could, not, be, seen, the, next, year, johann, ritter, working, at, the, other, end, of, the, spectrum, noticed, what, he, called, chemical, rays, invisible, light, rays, that, induced, certain, chemical, reactions, these, behaved, similarly, to, visible, violet, light, rays, but, were, beyond, them, in, the, spectrum, they, were, later, renamed, ultraviolet, radiation, the, study, of, electromagnetism, began, in, 1820, when, hans, christian, rsted, discovered, that, electric, currents, produce, magnetic, fields, oersted, s, law, light, was, first, linked, to, electromagnetism, in, 1845, when, michael, faraday, noticed, that, the, polarization, of, light, traveling, through, a, transparent, material, responded, to, a, magnetic, field, see, faraday, effect, during, the, 1860s, james, clerk, maxwell, developed, four, partial, differential, equations, maxwell, s, equations, for, the, electromagnetic, field, two, of, these, equations, predicted, the, possibility, and, behavior, of, waves, in, the, field, analyzing, the, speed, of, these, theoretical, waves, maxwell, realized, that, they, must, travel, at, a, speed, that, was, about, the, known, speed, of, light, this, startling, coincidence, in, value, led, maxwell, to, make, the, inference, that, light, itself, is, a, type, of, electromagnetic, wave, maxwell, s, equations, predicted, an, infinite, range, of, frequencies, of, electromagnetic, waves, all, traveling, at, the, speed, of, light, this, was, the, first, indication, of, the, existence, of, the, entire, electromagnetic, spectrum, maxwell, s, predicted, waves, included, waves, at, very, low, frequencies, compared, to, infrared, which, in, theory, might, be, created, by, oscillating, charges, in, an, ordinary, electrical, circuit, of, a, certain, type, attempting, to, prove, maxwell, s, equations, and, detect, such, low, frequency, electromagnetic, radiation, in, 1886, the, physicist, heinrich, hertz, built, an, apparatus, to, generate, and, detect, what, are, now, called, radio, waves, hertz, found, the, waves, and, was, able, to, infer, by, measuring, their, wavelength, and, multiplying, it, by, their, frequency, that, they, traveled, at, the, speed, of, light, hertz, also, demonstrated, that, the, new, radiation, could, be, both, reflected, and, refracted, by, various, dielectric, media, in, the, same, manner, as, light, for, example, hertz, was, able, to, focus, the, waves, using, a, lens, made, of, tree, resin, in, a, later, experiment, hertz, similarly, produced, and, measured, the, properties, of, microwaves, these, new, types, of, waves, paved, the, way, for, inventions, such, as, the, wireless, telegraph, and, the, radio, in, 1895, wilhelm, r, ntgen, noticed, a, new, type, of, radiation, emitted, during, an, experiment, with, an, evacuated, tube, subjected, to, a, high, voltage, he, called, this, radiation, x, rays, and, found, that, they, were, able, to, travel, through, parts, of, the, human, body, but, were, reflected, or, stopped, by, denser, matter, such, as, bones, before, long, many, uses, were, found, for, this, radiography, the, last, portion, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, was, filled, in, with, the, discovery, of, gamma, rays, in, 1900, paul, villard, was, studying, the, radioactive, emissions, of, radium, when, he, identified, a, new, type, of, radiation, that, he, at, first, thought, consisted, of, particles, similar, to, known, alpha, and, beta, particles, but, with, the, power, of, being, far, more, penetrating, than, either, however, in, 1910, british, physicist, william, henry, bragg, demonstrated, that, gamma, rays, are, electromagnetic, radiation, not, particles, and, in, 1914, ernest, rutherford, who, had, named, them, gamma, rays, in, 1903, when, he, realized, that, they, were, fundamentally, different, from, charged, alpha, and, beta, particles, and, edward, andrade, measured, their, wavelengths, and, found, that, gamma, rays, were, similar, to, x, rays, but, with, shorter, wavelengths, the, wave, particle, debate, was, rekindled, in, 1901, when, max, planck, discovered, that, light, is, absorbed, only, in, discrete, quanta, now, called, photons, implying, that, light, has, a, particle, nature, this, idea, was, made, explicit, by, albert, einstein, in, 1905, but, never, accepted, by, planck, and, many, other, contemporaries, the, modern, position, of, science, is, that, electromagnetic, radiation, has, both, a, wave, and, a, particle, nature, the, wave, particle, duality, the, contradictions, arising, from, this, position, are, still, being, debated, by, scientists, and, philosophers, electromagnetic, waves, are, typically, described, by, any, of, the, following, three, physical, properties, the, frequency, f, wavelength, or, photon, energy, e, frequencies, observed, in, astronomy, range, from, 2, 4, 10, 23, hz, 1, gev, gamma, rays, down, to, the, local, plasma, frequency, of, the, ionized, interstellar, medium, 1, khz, wavelength, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, wave, frequency, so, gamma, rays, have, very, short, wavelengths, that, are, fractions, of, the, size, of, atoms, whereas, wavelengths, on, the, opposite, end, of, the, spectrum, can, be, indefinitely, long, photon, energy, is, directly, proportional, to, the, wave, frequency, so, gamma, ray, photons, have, the, highest, energy, around, a, billion, electron, volts, while, radio, wave, photons, have, very, low, energy, around, a, femtoelectronvolt, these, relations, are, illustrated, by, the, following, equations, where, whenever, electromagnetic, waves, travel, in, a, medium, with, matter, their, wavelength, is, decreased, wavelengths, of, electromagnetic, radiation, whatever, medium, they, are, traveling, through, are, usually, quoted, in, terms, of, the, vacuum, wavelength, although, this, is, not, always, explicitly, stated, generally, electromagnetic, radiation, is, classified, by, wavelength, into, radio, wave, microwave, infrared, visible, light, ultraviolet, x, rays, and, gamma, rays, the, behavior, of, em, radiation, depends, on, its, wavelength, when, em, radiation, interacts, with, single, atoms, and, molecules, its, behavior, also, depends, on, the, amount, of, energy, per, quantum, photon, it, carries, spectroscopy, can, detect, a, much, wider, region, of, the, em, spectrum, than, the, visible, wavelength, range, of, 400, nm, to, 700, nm, in, a, vacuum, a, common, laboratory, spectroscope, can, detect, wavelengths, from, 2, nm, to, 2500, nm, detailed, information, about, the, physical, properties, of, objects, gases, or, even, stars, can, be, obtained, from, this, type, of, device, spectroscopes, are, widely, used, in, astrophysics, for, example, many, hydrogen, atoms, emit, a, radio, wave, photon, that, has, a, wavelength, of, 21, 12, cm, also, frequencies, of, 30, hz, and, below, can, be, produced, by, and, are, important, in, the, study, of, certain, stellar, nebulae, and, frequencies, as, high, as, 2, 9, 10, 27, hz, have, been, detected, from, astrophysical, sources, the, types, of, electromagnetic, radiation, are, broadly, classified, into, the, following, classes, regions, bands, or, types, this, classification, goes, in, the, increasing, order, of, wavelength, which, is, characteristic, of, the, type, of, radiation, there, are, no, precisely, defined, boundaries, between, the, bands, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, rather, they, fade, into, each, other, like, the, bands, in, a, rainbow, which, is, the, sub, spectrum, of, visible, light, radiation, of, each, frequency, and, wavelength, or, in, each, band, has, a, mix, of, properties, of, the, two, regions, of, the, spectrum, that, bound, it, for, example, red, light, resembles, infrared, radiation, in, that, it, can, excite, and, add, energy, to, some, chemical, bonds, and, indeed, must, do, so, to, power, the, chemical, mechanisms, responsible, for, photosynthesis, and, the, working, of, the, visual, system, the, distinction, between, x, rays, and, gamma, rays, is, partly, based, on, sources, the, photons, generated, from, nuclear, decay, or, other, nuclear, and, subnuclear, particle, process, are, always, termed, gamma, rays, whereas, x, rays, are, generated, by, electronic, transitions, involving, highly, energetic, inner, atomic, electrons, in, general, nuclear, transitions, are, much, more, energetic, than, electronic, transitions, so, gamma, rays, are, more, energetic, than, x, rays, but, exceptions, exist, by, analogy, to, electronic, transitions, muonic, atom, transitions, are, also, said, to, produce, x, rays, even, though, their, energy, may, exceed, 6, megaelectronvolts, 0, 96, pj, whereas, there, are, many, 77, known, to, be, less, than, 10, kev, 1, 6, fj, low, energy, nuclear, transitions, e, g, the, 7, 6, ev, 1, 22, aj, nuclear, transition, of, thorium, 229m, and, despite, being, one, million, fold, less, energetic, than, some, muonic, x, rays, the, emitted, photons, are, still, called, gamma, rays, due, to, their, nuclear, origin, the, convention, that, em, radiation, that, is, known, to, come, from, the, nucleus, is, always, called, gamma, ray, radiation, is, the, only, convention, that, is, universally, respected, however, many, astronomical, gamma, ray, sources, such, as, gamma, ray, bursts, are, known, to, be, too, energetic, in, both, intensity, and, wavelength, to, be, of, nuclear, origin, quite, often, in, high, energy, physics, and, in, medical, radiotherapy, very, high, energy, emr, in, the, 10, mev, region, which, is, of, higher, energy, than, any, nuclear, gamma, ray, is, not, called, x, ray, or, gamma, ray, but, instead, by, the, generic, term, of, high, energy, photons, the, region, of, the, spectrum, where, a, particular, observed, electromagnetic, radiation, falls, is, reference, frame, dependent, due, to, the, doppler, shift, for, light, so, em, radiation, that, one, observer, would, say, is, in, one, region, of, the, spectrum, could, appear, to, an, observer, moving, at, a, substantial, fraction, of, the, speed, of, light, with, respect, to, the, first, to, be, in, another, part, of, the, spectrum, for, example, consider, the, cosmic, microwave, background, it, was, produced, when, matter, and, radiation, decoupled, by, the, de, excitation, of, hydrogen, atoms, to, the, ground, state, these, photons, were, from, lyman, series, transitions, putting, them, in, the, ultraviolet, uv, part, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, now, this, radiation, has, undergone, enough, cosmological, red, shift, to, put, it, into, the, microwave, region, of, the, spectrum, for, observers, moving, slowly, compared, to, the, speed, of, light, with, respect, to, the, cosmos, electromagnetic, radiation, interacts, with, matter, in, different, ways, across, the, spectrum, these, types, of, interaction, are, so, different, that, historically, different, names, have, been, applied, to, different, parts, of, the, spectrum, as, though, these, were, different, types, of, radiation, thus, although, these, different, kinds, of, electromagnetic, radiation, form, a, quantitatively, continuous, spectrum, of, frequencies, and, wavelengths, the, spectrum, remains, divided, for, practical, reasons, arising, from, these, qualitative, interaction, differences, radio, waves, are, emitted, and, received, by, antennas, which, consist, of, conductors, such, as, metal, rod, resonators, in, artificial, generation, of, radio, waves, an, electronic, device, called, a, transmitter, generates, an, alternating, electric, current, which, is, applied, to, an, antenna, the, oscillating, electrons, in, the, antenna, generate, oscillating, electric, and, magnetic, fields, that, radiate, away, from, the, antenna, as, radio, waves, in, reception, of, radio, waves, the, oscillating, electric, and, magnetic, fields, of, a, radio, wave, couple, to, the, electrons, in, an, antenna, pushing, them, back, and, forth, creating, oscillating, currents, which, are, applied, to, a, radio, receiver, earth, s, atmosphere, is, mainly, transparent, to, radio, waves, except, for, layers, of, charged, particles, in, the, ionosphere, which, can, reflect, certain, frequencies, radio, waves, are, extremely, widely, used, to, transmit, information, across, distances, in, radio, communication, systems, such, as, radio, broadcasting, television, two, way, radios, mobile, phones, communication, satellites, and, wireless, networking, in, a, radio, communication, system, a, radio, frequency, current, is, modulated, with, an, information, bearing, signal, in, a, transmitter, by, varying, either, the, amplitude, frequency, or, phase, and, applied, to, an, antenna, the, radio, waves, carry, the, information, across, space, to, a, receiver, where, they, are, received, by, an, antenna, and, the, information, extracted, by, demodulation, in, the, receiver, radio, waves, are, also, used, for, navigation, in, systems, like, global, positioning, system, gps, and, navigational, beacons, and, locating, distant, objects, in, radiolocation, and, radar, they, are, also, used, for, remote, control, and, for, industrial, heating, the, use, of, the, radio, spectrum, is, strictly, regulated, by, governments, coordinated, by, the, international, telecommunication, union, itu, which, allocates, frequencies, to, different, users, for, different, uses, microwaves, are, radio, waves, of, short, wavelength, from, about, 10, centimeters, to, one, millimeter, in, the, shf, and, ehf, frequency, bands, microwave, energy, is, produced, with, klystron, and, magnetron, tubes, and, with, solid, state, devices, such, as, gunn, and, impatt, diodes, although, they, are, emitted, and, absorbed, by, short, antennas, they, are, also, absorbed, by, polar, molecules, coupling, to, vibrational, and, rotational, modes, resulting, in, bulk, heating, unlike, higher, frequency, waves, such, as, infrared, and, visible, light, which, are, absorbed, mainly, at, surfaces, microwaves, can, penetrate, into, materials, and, deposit, their, energy, below, the, surface, this, effect, is, used, to, heat, food, in, microwave, ovens, and, for, industrial, heating, and, medical, diathermy, microwaves, are, the, main, wavelengths, used, in, radar, and, are, used, for, satellite, communication, and, wireless, networking, technologies, such, as, wi, fi, the, copper, cables, transmission, lines, which, are, used, to, carry, lower, frequency, radio, waves, to, antennas, have, excessive, power, losses, at, microwave, frequencies, and, metal, pipes, called, waveguides, are, used, to, carry, them, although, at, the, low, end, of, the, band, the, atmosphere, is, mainly, transparent, at, the, upper, end, of, the, band, absorption, of, microwaves, by, atmospheric, gases, limits, practical, propagation, distances, to, a, few, kilometers, terahertz, radiation, or, sub, millimeter, radiation, is, a, region, of, the, spectrum, from, about, 100, ghz, to, 30, terahertz, thz, between, microwaves, and, far, infrared, which, can, be, regarded, as, belonging, to, either, band, until, recently, the, range, was, rarely, studied, and, few, sources, existed, for, microwave, energy, in, the, so, called, terahertz, gap, but, applications, such, as, imaging, and, communications, are, now, appearing, scientists, are, also, looking, to, apply, terahertz, technology, in, the, armed, forces, where, high, frequency, waves, might, be, directed, at, enemy, troops, to, incapacitate, their, electronic, equipment, terahertz, radiation, is, strongly, absorbed, by, atmospheric, gases, making, this, frequency, range, useless, for, long, distance, communication, the, infrared, part, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, covers, the, range, from, roughly, 300, ghz, to, 400, thz, 1, mm, 750, nm, it, can, be, divided, into, three, parts, above, infrared, in, frequency, comes, visible, light, the, sun, emits, its, peak, power, in, the, visible, region, although, integrating, the, entire, emission, power, spectrum, through, all, wavelengths, shows, that, the, sun, emits, slightly, more, infrared, than, visible, light, by, definition, visible, light, is, the, part, of, the, em, spectrum, the, human, eye, is, the, most, sensitive, to, visible, light, and, near, infrared, light, is, typically, absorbed, and, emitted, by, electrons, in, molecules, and, atoms, that, move, from, one, energy, level, to, another, this, action, allows, the, chemical, mechanisms, that, underlie, human, vision, and, plant, photosynthesis, the, light, that, excites, the, human, visual, system, is, a, very, small, portion, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, a, rainbow, shows, the, optical, visible, part, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, infrared, if, it, could, be, seen, would, be, located, just, beyond, the, red, side, of, the, rainbow, whilst, ultraviolet, would, appear, just, beyond, the, opposite, violet, end, electromagnetic, radiation, with, a, wavelength, between, 380, nm, and, 760, nm, 400, 790, terahertz, is, detected, by, the, human, eye, and, perceived, as, visible, light, other, wavelengths, especially, near, infrared, longer, than, 760, nm, and, ultraviolet, shorter, than, 380, nm, are, also, sometimes, referred, to, as, light, especially, when, the, visibility, to, humans, is, not, relevant, white, light, is, a, combination, of, lights, of, different, wavelengths, in, the, visible, spectrum, passing, white, light, through, a, prism, splits, it, up, into, the, several, colours, of, light, observed, in, the, visible, spectrum, between, 400, nm, and, 780, nm, if, radiation, having, a, frequency, in, the, visible, region, of, the, em, spectrum, reflects, off, an, object, say, a, bowl, of, fruit, and, then, strikes, the, eyes, this, results, in, visual, perception, of, the, scene, the, brain, s, visual, system, processes, the, multitude, of, reflected, frequencies, into, different, shades, and, hues, and, through, this, insufficiently, understood, psychophysical, phenomenon, most, people, perceive, a, bowl, of, fruit, at, most, wavelengths, however, the, information, carried, by, electromagnetic, radiation, is, not, directly, detected, by, human, senses, natural, sources, produce, em, radiation, across, the, spectrum, and, technology, can, also, manipulate, a, broad, range, of, wavelengths, optical, fiber, transmits, light, that, although, not, necessarily, in, the, visible, part, of, the, spectrum, it, is, usually, infrared, can, carry, information, the, modulation, is, similar, to, that, used, with, radio, waves, next, in, frequency, comes, ultraviolet, uv, in, frequency, and, thus, energy, uv, rays, sit, between, the, violet, end, of, the, visible, spectrum, and, the, x, ray, range, the, uv, wavelength, spectrum, ranges, from, 399, nm, to, 10, nm, and, is, divided, into, 3, sections, uva, uvb, and, uvc, uv, is, the, lowest, energy, range, energetic, enough, to, ionize, atoms, separating, electrons, from, them, and, thus, causing, chemical, reactions, uv, x, rays, and, gamma, rays, are, thus, collectively, called, ionizing, radiation, exposure, to, them, can, damage, living, tissue, uv, can, also, cause, substances, to, glow, with, visible, light, this, is, called, fluorescence, uv, fluorescence, is, used, by, forensics, to, detect, any, evidence, like, blood, and, urine, that, is, produced, by, a, crime, scene, also, uv, fluorescence, is, used, to, detect, counterfeit, money, and, ids, as, they, are, laced, with, material, that, can, glow, under, uv, at, the, middle, range, of, uv, uv, rays, cannot, ionize, but, can, break, chemical, bonds, making, molecules, unusually, reactive, sunburn, for, example, is, caused, by, the, disruptive, effects, of, middle, range, uv, radiation, on, skin, cells, which, is, the, main, cause, of, skin, cancer, uv, rays, in, the, middle, range, can, irreparably, damage, the, complex, dna, molecules, in, the, cells, producing, thymine, dimers, making, it, a, very, potent, mutagen, due, to, skin, cancer, caused, by, uv, the, sunscreen, industry, was, invented, to, combat, uv, damage, mid, uv, wavelengths, are, called, uvb, and, uvb, lights, such, as, germicidal, lamps, are, used, to, kill, germs, and, also, to, sterilize, water, the, sun, emits, uv, radiation, about, 10, of, its, total, power, including, extremely, short, wavelength, uv, that, could, potentially, destroy, most, life, on, land, ocean, water, would, provide, some, protection, for, life, there, however, most, of, the, sun, s, damaging, uv, wavelengths, are, absorbed, by, the, atmosphere, before, they, reach, the, surface, the, higher, energy, shortest, wavelength, ranges, of, uv, called, vacuum, uv, are, absorbed, by, nitrogen, and, at, longer, wavelengths, by, simple, diatomic, oxygen, in, the, air, most, of, the, uv, in, the, mid, range, of, energy, is, blocked, by, the, ozone, layer, which, absorbs, strongly, in, the, important, 200, 315, nm, range, the, lower, energy, part, of, which, is, too, long, for, ordinary, dioxygen, in, air, to, absorb, this, leaves, less, than, 3, of, sunlight, at, sea, level, in, uv, with, all, of, this, remainder, at, the, lower, energies, the, remainder, is, uv, a, along, with, some, uv, b, the, very, lowest, energy, range, of, uv, between, 315, nm, and, visible, light, called, uv, a, is, not, blocked, well, by, the, atmosphere, but, does, not, cause, sunburn, and, does, less, biological, damage, however, it, is, not, harmless, and, does, create, oxygen, radicals, mutations, and, skin, damage, after, uv, come, x, rays, which, like, the, upper, ranges, of, uv, are, also, ionizing, however, due, to, their, higher, energies, x, rays, can, also, interact, with, matter, by, means, of, the, compton, effect, hard, x, rays, have, shorter, wavelengths, than, soft, x, rays, and, as, they, can, pass, through, many, substances, with, little, absorption, they, can, be, used, to, see, through, objects, with, thicknesses, less, than, that, equivalent, to, a, few, meters, of, water, one, notable, use, is, diagnostic, x, ray, imaging, in, medicine, a, process, known, as, radiography, x, rays, are, useful, as, probes, in, high, energy, physics, in, astronomy, the, accretion, disks, around, neutron, stars, and, black, holes, emit, x, rays, enabling, studies, of, these, phenomena, x, rays, are, also, emitted, by, stellar, corona, and, are, strongly, emitted, by, some, types, of, nebulae, however, x, ray, telescopes, must, be, placed, outside, the, earth, s, atmosphere, to, see, astronomical, x, rays, since, the, great, depth, of, the, atmosphere, of, earth, is, opaque, to, x, rays, with, areal, density, of, 1000, g, cm, 2, equivalent, to, 10, meters, thickness, of, water, this, is, an, amount, sufficient, to, block, almost, all, astronomical, x, rays, and, also, astronomical, gamma, rays, see, below, after, hard, x, rays, come, gamma, rays, which, were, discovered, by, paul, ulrich, villard, in, 1900, these, are, the, most, energetic, photons, having, no, defined, lower, limit,
