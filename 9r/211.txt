a, quasar, k, w, e, z, r, kway, zar, is, an, extremely, luminous, active, galactic, nucleus, agn, it, is, sometimes, known, as, a, quasi, stellar, object, abbreviated, qso, the, emission, from, an, agn, is, powered, by, a, supermassive, black, hole, with, a, mass, ranging, from, millions, to, tens, of, billions, of, solar, masses, surrounded, by, a, gaseous, accretion, disc, gas, in, the, disc, falling, towards, the, black, hole, heats, up, and, releases, energy, in, the, form, of, electromagnetic, radiation, the, radiant, energy, of, quasars, is, enormous, the, most, powerful, quasars, have, luminosities, thousands, of, times, greater, than, that, of, a, galaxy, such, as, the, milky, way, quasars, are, usually, categorized, as, a, subclass, of, the, more, general, category, of, agn, the, redshifts, of, quasars, are, of, cosmological, origin, the, term, quasar, originated, as, a, contraction, of, quasi, stellar, radio, source, because, they, were, first, identified, during, the, 1950s, as, sources, of, radio, wave, emission, of, unknown, physical, origin, and, when, identified, in, photographic, images, at, visible, wavelengths, they, resembled, faint, star, like, points, of, light, high, resolution, images, of, quasars, particularly, from, the, hubble, space, telescope, have, shown, that, quasars, occur, in, the, centers, of, galaxies, and, that, some, host, galaxies, are, strongly, interacting, or, merging, galaxies, as, with, other, categories, of, agn, the, observed, properties, of, a, quasar, depend, on, many, factors, including, the, mass, of, the, black, hole, the, rate, of, gas, accretion, the, orientation, of, the, accretion, disc, relative, to, the, observer, the, presence, or, absence, of, a, jet, and, the, degree, of, obscuration, by, gas, and, dust, within, the, host, galaxy, about, a, million, quasars, have, been, identified, with, reliable, spectroscopic, redshifts, and, between, 2, 3, million, identified, in, photometric, catalogs, the, nearest, known, quasar, is, about, 600, million, light, years, from, earth, the, record, for, the, most, distant, known, quasar, continues, to, change, in, 2017, quasar, ulas, j1342, 0928, was, detected, at, redshift, z, 7, 54, light, observed, from, this, 800, million, solar, mass, quasar, was, emitted, when, the, universe, was, only, 690, million, years, old, in, 2020, quasar, p, niu, ena, was, detected, from, a, time, only, 700, million, years, after, the, big, bang, and, with, an, estimated, mass, of, 1, 5, billion, times, the, mass, of, the, sun, in, early, 2021, the, quasar, qso, j0313, 1806, with, a, 1, 6, billion, solar, mass, black, hole, was, reported, at, z, 7, 64, 670, million, years, after, the, big, bang, quasar, discovery, surveys, have, shown, that, quasar, activity, was, more, common, in, the, distant, past, the, peak, epoch, was, approximately, 10, billion, years, ago, concentrations, of, multiple, quasars, are, known, as, large, quasar, groups, and, may, constitute, some, of, the, largest, known, structures, in, the, universe, if, the, observed, groups, are, good, tracers, of, mass, distribution, the, term, quasar, was, first, used, in, an, article, by, astrophysicist, hong, yee, chiu, in, may, 1964, in, physics, today, to, describe, certain, astronomically, puzzling, objects, so, far, the, clumsily, long, name, quasi, stellar, radio, sources, is, used, to, describe, these, objects, because, the, nature, of, these, objects, is, entirely, unknown, it, is, hard, to, prepare, a, short, appropriate, nomenclature, for, them, so, that, their, essential, properties, are, obvious, from, their, name, for, convenience, the, abbreviated, form, quasar, will, be, used, throughout, this, paper, between, 1917, and, 1922, it, became, clear, from, work, by, heber, doust, curtis, ernst, pik, and, others, that, some, objects, nebulae, seen, by, astronomers, were, in, fact, distant, galaxies, like, the, milky, way, but, when, radio, astronomy, began, in, the, 1950s, astronomers, detected, among, the, galaxies, a, small, number, of, anomalous, objects, with, properties, that, defied, explanation, the, objects, emitted, large, amounts, of, radiation, of, many, frequencies, but, no, source, could, be, located, optically, or, in, some, cases, only, a, faint, and, point, like, object, somewhat, like, a, distant, star, the, spectral, lines, of, these, objects, which, identify, the, chemical, elements, of, which, the, object, is, composed, were, also, extremely, strange, and, defied, explanation, some, of, them, changed, their, luminosity, very, rapidly, in, the, optical, range, and, even, more, rapidly, in, the, x, ray, range, suggesting, an, upper, limit, on, their, size, perhaps, no, larger, than, the, solar, system, this, implies, an, extremely, high, power, density, considerable, discussion, took, place, over, what, these, objects, might, be, they, were, described, as, quasi, stellar, radio, sources, or, quasi, stellar, objects, qsos, a, name, which, reflected, their, unknown, nature, and, this, became, shortened, to, quasar, the, first, quasars, 3c, 48, and, 3c, 273, were, discovered, in, the, late, 1950s, as, radio, sources, in, all, sky, radio, surveys, they, were, first, noted, as, radio, sources, with, no, corresponding, visible, object, using, small, telescopes, and, the, lovell, telescope, as, an, interferometer, they, were, shown, to, have, a, very, small, angular, size, by, 1960, hundreds, of, these, objects, had, been, recorded, and, published, in, the, third, cambridge, catalogue, while, astronomers, scanned, the, skies, for, their, optical, counterparts, in, 1963, a, definite, identification, of, the, radio, source, 3c, 48, with, an, optical, object, was, published, by, allan, sandage, and, thomas, a, matthews, astronomers, had, detected, what, appeared, to, be, a, faint, blue, star, at, the, location, of, the, radio, source, and, obtained, its, spectrum, which, contained, many, unknown, broad, emission, lines, the, anomalous, spectrum, defied, interpretation, british, australian, astronomer, john, bolton, made, many, early, observations, of, quasars, including, a, breakthrough, in, 1962, another, radio, source, 3c, 273, was, predicted, to, undergo, five, occultations, by, the, moon, measurements, taken, by, cyril, hazard, and, john, bolton, during, one, of, the, occultations, using, the, parkes, radio, telescope, allowed, maarten, schmidt, to, find, a, visible, counterpart, to, the, radio, source, and, obtain, an, optical, spectrum, using, the, 200, inch, 5, 1, m, hale, telescope, on, mount, palomar, this, spectrum, revealed, the, same, strange, emission, lines, schmidt, was, able, to, demonstrate, that, these, were, likely, to, be, the, ordinary, spectral, lines, of, hydrogen, redshifted, by, 15, 8, at, the, time, a, high, redshift, with, only, a, handful, of, much, fainter, galaxies, known, with, higher, redshift, if, this, was, due, to, the, physical, motion, of, the, star, then, 3c, 273, was, receding, at, an, enormous, velocity, around, 47, 000, km, s, far, beyond, the, speed, of, any, known, star, and, defying, any, obvious, explanation, nor, would, an, extreme, velocity, help, to, explain, 3c, 273, s, huge, radio, emissions, if, the, redshift, was, cosmological, now, known, to, be, correct, the, large, distance, implied, that, 3c, 273, was, far, more, luminous, than, any, galaxy, but, much, more, compact, also, 3c, 273, was, bright, enough, to, detect, on, archival, photographs, dating, back, to, the, 1900s, it, was, found, to, be, variable, on, yearly, timescales, implying, that, a, substantial, fraction, of, the, light, was, emitted, from, a, region, less, than, 1, light, year, in, size, tiny, compared, to, a, galaxy, although, it, raised, many, questions, schmidt, s, discovery, quickly, revolutionized, quasar, observation, the, strange, spectrum, of, 3c, 48, was, quickly, identified, by, schmidt, greenstein, and, oke, as, hydrogen, and, magnesium, redshifted, by, 37, shortly, afterwards, two, more, quasar, spectra, in, 1964, and, five, more, in, 1965, were, also, confirmed, as, ordinary, light, that, had, been, redshifted, to, an, extreme, degree, while, the, observations, and, redshifts, themselves, were, not, doubted, their, correct, interpretation, was, heavily, debated, and, bolton, s, suggestion, that, the, radiation, detected, from, quasars, were, ordinary, spectral, lines, from, distant, highly, redshifted, sources, with, extreme, velocity, was, not, widely, accepted, at, the, time, an, extreme, redshift, could, imply, great, distance, and, velocity, but, could, also, be, due, to, extreme, mass, or, perhaps, some, other, unknown, laws, of, nature, extreme, velocity, and, distance, would, also, imply, immense, power, output, which, lacked, explanation, the, small, sizes, were, confirmed, by, interferometry, and, by, observing, the, speed, with, which, the, quasar, as, a, whole, varied, in, output, and, by, their, inability, to, be, seen, in, even, the, most, powerful, visible, light, telescopes, as, anything, more, than, faint, starlike, points, of, light, but, if, they, were, small, and, far, away, in, space, their, power, output, would, have, to, be, immense, and, difficult, to, explain, equally, if, they, were, very, small, and, much, closer, to, this, galaxy, it, would, be, easy, to, explain, their, apparent, power, output, but, less, easy, to, explain, their, redshifts, and, lack, of, detectable, movement, against, the, background, of, the, universe, schmidt, noted, that, redshift, is, also, associated, with, the, expansion, of, the, universe, as, codified, in, hubble, s, law, if, the, measured, redshift, was, due, to, expansion, then, this, would, support, an, interpretation, of, very, distant, objects, with, extraordinarily, high, luminosity, and, power, output, far, beyond, any, object, seen, to, date, this, extreme, luminosity, would, also, explain, the, large, radio, signal, schmidt, concluded, that, 3c, 273, could, either, be, an, individual, star, around, 10, km, wide, within, or, near, to, this, galaxy, or, a, distant, active, galactic, nucleus, he, stated, that, a, distant, and, extremely, powerful, object, seemed, more, likely, to, be, correct, schmidt, s, explanation, for, the, high, redshift, was, not, widely, accepted, at, the, time, a, major, concern, was, the, enormous, amount, of, energy, these, objects, would, have, to, be, radiating, if, they, were, distant, in, the, 1960s, no, commonly, accepted, mechanism, could, account, for, this, the, currently, accepted, explanation, that, it, is, due, to, matter, in, an, accretion, disc, falling, into, a, supermassive, black, hole, was, only, suggested, in, 1964, by, edwin, e, salpeter, and, yakov, zeldovich, and, even, then, it, was, rejected, by, many, astronomers, as, at, this, time, the, existence, of, black, holes, at, all, was, widely, seen, as, theoretical, various, explanations, were, proposed, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, each, with, their, own, problems, it, was, suggested, that, quasars, were, nearby, objects, and, that, their, redshift, was, not, due, to, the, expansion, of, space, but, rather, to, light, escaping, a, deep, gravitational, well, this, would, require, a, massive, object, which, would, also, explain, the, high, luminosities, however, a, star, of, sufficient, mass, to, produce, the, measured, redshift, would, be, unstable, and, in, excess, of, the, hayashi, limit, quasars, also, show, forbidden, spectral, emission, lines, previously, only, seen, in, hot, gaseous, nebulae, of, low, density, which, would, be, too, diffuse, to, both, generate, the, observed, power, and, fit, within, a, deep, gravitational, well, there, were, also, serious, concerns, regarding, the, idea, of, cosmologically, distant, quasars, one, strong, argument, against, them, was, that, they, implied, energies, that, were, far, in, excess, of, known, energy, conversion, processes, including, nuclear, fusion, there, were, suggestions, that, quasars, were, made, of, some, hitherto, unknown, stable, form, of, antimatter, in, similarly, unknown, types, of, region, of, space, and, that, this, might, account, for, their, brightness, others, speculated, that, quasars, were, a, white, hole, end, of, a, wormhole, or, a, chain, reaction, of, numerous, supernovae, eventually, starting, from, about, the, 1970s, many, lines, of, evidence, including, the, first, x, ray, space, observatories, knowledge, of, black, holes, and, modern, models, of, cosmology, gradually, demonstrated, that, the, quasar, redshifts, are, genuine, and, due, to, the, expansion, of, space, that, quasars, are, in, fact, as, powerful, and, as, distant, as, schmidt, and, some, other, astronomers, had, suggested, and, that, their, energy, source, is, matter, from, an, accretion, disc, falling, onto, a, supermassive, black, hole, this, included, crucial, evidence, from, optical, and, x, ray, viewing, of, quasar, host, galaxies, finding, of, intervening, absorption, lines, which, explained, various, spectral, anomalies, observations, from, gravitational, lensing, gunn, s, 1971, finding, that, galaxies, containing, quasars, showed, the, same, redshift, as, the, quasars, and, kristian, s, 1973, finding, that, the, fuzzy, surrounding, of, many, quasars, was, consistent, with, a, less, luminous, host, galaxy, this, model, also, fits, well, with, other, observations, suggesting, that, many, or, even, most, galaxies, have, a, massive, central, black, hole, it, would, also, explain, why, quasars, are, more, common, in, the, early, universe, as, a, quasar, draws, matter, from, its, accretion, disc, there, comes, a, point, when, there, is, less, matter, nearby, and, energy, production, falls, off, or, ceases, as, the, quasar, becomes, a, more, ordinary, type, of, galaxy, the, accretion, disc, energy, production, mechanism, was, finally, modeled, in, the, 1970s, and, black, holes, were, also, directly, detected, including, evidence, showing, that, supermassive, black, holes, could, be, found, at, the, centers, of, this, and, many, other, galaxies, which, resolved, the, concern, that, quasars, were, too, luminous, to, be, a, result, of, very, distant, objects, or, that, a, suitable, mechanism, could, not, be, confirmed, to, exist, in, nature, by, 1987, it, was, well, accepted, that, this, was, the, correct, explanation, for, quasars, and, the, cosmological, distance, and, energy, output, of, quasars, was, accepted, by, almost, all, researchers, later, it, was, found, that, not, all, quasars, have, strong, radio, emission, in, fact, only, about, 10, are, radio, loud, hence, the, name, qso, quasi, stellar, object, is, used, in, addition, to, quasar, to, refer, to, these, objects, further, categorized, into, the, radio, loud, and, the, radio, quiet, classes, the, discovery, of, the, quasar, had, large, implications, for, the, field, of, astronomy, in, the, 1960s, including, drawing, physics, and, astronomy, closer, together, in, 1979, the, gravitational, lens, effect, predicted, by, albert, einstein, s, general, theory, of, relativity, was, confirmed, observationally, for, the, first, time, with, images, of, the, double, quasar, 0957, 561, a, study, published, in, february, 2021, showed, that, there, are, more, quasars, in, one, direction, towards, hydra, than, in, the, opposite, direction, seemingly, indicating, that, the, earth, is, moving, in, that, direction, but, the, direction, of, this, dipole, is, about, 28, away, from, the, direction, of, the, earth, s, motion, relative, to, the, cosmic, microwave, background, radiation, in, march, 2021, a, collaboration, of, scientists, related, to, the, event, horizon, telescope, presented, for, the, first, time, a, polarized, based, image, of, a, black, hole, specifically, the, black, hole, at, the, center, of, messier, 87, an, elliptical, galaxy, approximately, 55, million, light, years, away, in, the, constellation, virgo, revealing, the, forces, giving, rise, to, quasars, it, is, now, known, that, quasars, are, distant, but, extremely, luminous, objects, so, any, light, that, reaches, the, earth, is, redshifted, due, to, the, expansion, of, the, universe, quasars, inhabit, the, centers, of, active, galaxies, and, are, among, the, most, luminous, powerful, and, energetic, objects, known, in, the, universe, emitting, up, to, a, thousand, times, the, energy, output, of, the, milky, way, which, contains, 200, 400, billion, stars, this, radiation, is, emitted, across, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, almost, uniformly, from, x, rays, to, the, far, infrared, with, a, peak, in, the, ultraviolet, optical, bands, with, some, quasars, also, being, strong, sources, of, radio, emission, and, of, gamma, rays, with, high, resolution, imaging, from, ground, based, telescopes, and, the, hubble, space, telescope, the, host, galaxies, surrounding, the, quasars, have, been, detected, in, some, cases, these, galaxies, are, normally, too, dim, to, be, seen, against, the, glare, of, the, quasar, except, with, special, techniques, most, quasars, with, the, exception, of, 3c, 273, whose, average, apparent, magnitude, is, 12, 9, cannot, be, seen, with, small, telescopes, quasars, are, believed, and, in, many, cases, confirmed, to, be, powered, by, accretion, of, material, into, supermassive, black, holes, in, the, nuclei, of, distant, galaxies, as, suggested, in, 1964, by, edwin, salpeter, and, yakov, zeldovich, light, and, other, radiation, cannot, escape, from, within, the, event, horizon, of, a, black, hole, the, energy, produced, by, a, quasar, is, generated, outside, the, black, hole, by, gravitational, stresses, and, immense, friction, within, the, material, nearest, to, the, black, hole, as, it, orbits, and, falls, inward, the, huge, luminosity, of, quasars, results, from, the, accretion, discs, of, central, supermassive, black, holes, which, can, convert, between, 5, 7, and, 32, of, the, mass, of, an, object, into, energy, compared, to, just, 0, 7, for, the, p, p, chain, nuclear, fusion, process, that, dominates, the, energy, production, in, sun, like, stars, central, masses, of, 10, 5, to, 10, 9, solar, masses, have, been, measured, in, quasars, by, using, reverberation, mapping, several, dozen, nearby, large, galaxies, including, the, milky, way, galaxy, that, do, not, have, an, active, center, and, do, not, show, any, activity, similar, to, a, quasar, are, confirmed, to, contain, a, similar, supermassive, black, hole, in, their, nuclei, galactic, center, thus, it, is, now, thought, that, all, large, galaxies, have, a, black, hole, of, this, kind, but, only, a, small, fraction, have, sufficient, matter, in, the, right, kind, of, orbit, at, their, center, to, become, active, and, power, radiation, in, such, a, way, as, to, be, seen, as, quasars, this, also, explains, why, quasars, were, more, common, in, the, early, universe, as, this, energy, production, ends, when, the, supermassive, black, hole, consumes, all, of, the, gas, and, dust, near, it, this, means, that, it, is, possible, that, most, galaxies, including, the, milky, way, have, gone, through, an, active, stage, appearing, as, a, quasar, or, some, other, class, of, active, galaxy, that, depended, on, the, black, hole, mass, and, the, accretion, rate, and, are, now, quiescent, because, they, lack, a, supply, of, matter, to, feed, into, their, central, black, holes, to, generate, radiation, the, matter, accreting, onto, the, black, hole, is, unlikely, to, fall, directly, in, but, will, have, some, angular, momentum, around, the, black, hole, which, will, cause, the, matter, to, collect, into, an, accretion, disc, quasars, may, also, be, ignited, or, re, ignited, when, normal, galaxies, merge, and, the, black, hole, is, infused, with, a, fresh, source, of, matter, in, fact, it, has, been, suggested, that, a, quasar, could, form, when, the, andromeda, galaxy, collides, with, the, milky, way, galaxy, in, approximately, 3, 5, billion, years, in, the, 1980s, unified, models, were, developed, in, which, quasars, were, classified, as, a, particular, kind, of, active, galaxy, and, a, consensus, emerged, that, in, many, cases, it, is, simply, the, viewing, angle, that, distinguishes, them, from, other, active, galaxies, such, as, blazars, and, radio, galaxies, the, highest, redshift, quasar, known, as, of, august, 2024, is, uhz1, with, a, redshift, of, approximately, 10, 1, which, corresponds, to, a, comoving, distance, of, approximately, 31, 7, billion, light, years, from, earth, these, distances, are, much, larger, than, the, distance, light, could, travel, in, the, universe, s, 13, 8, billion, year, history, because, the, universe, is, expanding, it, is, now, understood, that, many, quasars, are, triggered, by, the, collisions, of, galaxies, which, drives, the, mass, of, the, galaxies, into, the, supermassive, black, holes, at, their, centers, more, than, 900, 000, quasars, have, been, found, as, of, july, 2023, most, from, the, sloan, digital, sky, survey, all, observed, quasar, spectra, have, redshifts, between, 0, 056, and, 7, 64, as, of, 2021, which, means, they, range, between, 600, million, and, 30, billion, light, years, away, from, earth, because, of, the, great, distances, to, the, farthest, quasars, and, the, finite, velocity, of, light, they, and, their, surrounding, space, appear, as, they, existed, in, the, very, early, universe, the, power, of, quasars, originates, from, supermassive, black, holes, that, are, believed, to, exist, at, the, core, of, most, galaxies, the, doppler, shifts, of, stars, near, the, cores, of, galaxies, indicate, that, they, are, revolving, around, tremendous, masses, with, very, steep, gravity, gradients, suggesting, black, holes, although, quasars, appear, faint, when, viewed, from, earth, they, are, visible, from, extreme, distances, being, the, most, luminous, objects, in, the, known, universe, the, brightest, quasar, in, the, sky, is, 3c, 273, in, the, constellation, of, virgo, it, has, an, average, apparent, magnitude, of, 12, 8, bright, enough, to, be, seen, through, a, medium, size, amateur, telescope, but, it, has, an, absolute, magnitude, of, 26, 7, from, a, distance, of, about, 33, light, years, this, object, would, shine, in, the, sky, about, as, brightly, as, the, sun, this, quasar, s, luminosity, is, therefore, about, 4, trillion, 4, 10, 12, times, that, of, the, sun, or, about, 100, times, that, of, the, total, light, of, giant, galaxies, like, the, milky, way, this, assumes, that, the, quasar, is, radiating, energy, in, all, directions, but, the, active, galactic, nucleus, is, believed, to, be, radiating, preferentially, in, the, direction, of, its, jet, in, a, universe, containing, hundreds, of, billions, of, galaxies, most, of, which, had, active, nuclei, billions, of, years, ago, but, only, seen, today, it, is, statistically, certain, that, thousands, of, energy, jets, should, be, pointed, toward, the, earth, some, more, directly, than, others, in, many, cases, it, is, likely, that, the, brighter, the, quasar, the, more, directly, its, jet, is, aimed, at, the, earth, such, quasars, are, called, blazars, the, hyperluminous, quasar, apm, 08279, 5255, was, when, discovered, in, 1998, given, an, absolute, magnitude, of, 32, 2, high, resolution, imaging, with, the, hubble, space, telescope, and, the, 10, m, keck, telescope, revealed, that, this, system, is, gravitationally, lensed, a, study, of, the, gravitational, lensing, of, this, system, suggests, that, the, light, emitted, has, been, magnified, by, a, factor, of, 10, it, is, still, substantially, more, luminous, than, nearby, quasars, such, as, 3c, 273, quasars, were, much, more, common, in, the, early, universe, than, they, are, today, this, discovery, by, maarten, schmidt, in, 1967, was, early, strong, evidence, against, steady, state, cosmology, and, in, favor, of, the, big, bang, cosmology, quasars, show, the, locations, where, supermassive, black, holes, are, growing, rapidly, by, accretion, detailed, simulations, reported, in, 2021, showed, that, galaxy, structures, such, as, spiral, arms, use, gravitational, forces, to, put, the, brakes, on, gas, that, would, otherwise, orbit, galaxy, centers, forever, instead, the, braking, mechanism, enabled, the, gas, to, fall, into, the, supermassive, black, holes, releasing, enormous, radiant, energies, these, black, holes, co, evolve, with, the, mass, of, stars, in, their, host, galaxy, in, a, way, not, fully, understood, at, present, one, idea, is, that, jets, radiation, and, winds, created, by, the, quasars, shut, down, the, formation, of, new, stars, in, the, host, galaxy, a, process, called, feedback, the, jets, that, produce, strong, radio, emission, in, some, quasars, at, the, centers, of, clusters, of, galaxies, are, known, to, have, enough, power, to, prevent, the, hot, gas, in, those, clusters, from, cooling, and, falling, on, to, the, central, galaxy, quasars, luminosities, are, variable, with, time, scales, that, range, from, months, to, hours, this, means, that, quasars, generate, and, emit, their, energy, from, a, very, small, region, since, each, part, of, the, quasar, would, have, to, be, in, contact, with, other, parts, on, such, a, time, scale, as, to, allow, the, coordination, of, the, luminosity, variations, this, would, mean, that, a, quasar, varying, on, a, time, scale, of, a, few, weeks, cannot, be, larger, than, a, few, light, weeks, across, the, emission, of, large, amounts, of, power, from, a, small, region, requires, a, power, source, far, more, efficient, than, the, nuclear, fusion, that, powers, stars, the, conversion, of, gravitational, potential, energy, to, radiation, by, infalling, to, a, black, hole, converts, between, 6, and, 32, of, the, mass, to, energy, compared, to, 0, 7, for, the, conversion, of, mass, to, energy, in, a, star, like, the, sun, it, is, the, only, process, known, that, can, produce, such, high, power, over, a, very, long, term, stellar, explosions, such, as, supernovas, and, gamma, ray, bursts, and, direct, matter, antimatter, annihilation, can, also, produce, very, high, power, output, but, supernovae, only, last, for, days, and, the, universe, does, not, appear, to, have, had, large, amounts, of, antimatter, at, the, relevant, times, since, quasars, exhibit, all, the, properties, common, to, other, active, galaxies, such, as, seyfert, galaxies, the, emission, from, quasars, can, be, readily, compared, to, those, of, smaller, active, galaxies, powered, by, smaller, supermassive, black, holes, to, create, a, luminosity, of, 10, 40, watts, the, typical, brightness, of, a, quasar, a, supermassive, black, hole, would, have, to, consume, the, material, equivalent, of, 10, solar, masses, per, year, the, brightest, known, quasars, devour, 1000, solar, masses, of, material, every, year, the, largest, known, is, estimated, to, consume, matter, equivalent, to, 10, earths, per, second, quasar, luminosities, can, vary, considerably, over, time, depending, on, their, surroundings, since, it, is, difficult, to, fuel, quasars, for, many, billions, of, years, after, a, quasar, finishes, accreting, the, surrounding, gas, and, dust, it, becomes, an, ordinary, galaxy, radiation, from, quasars, is, partially, nonthermal, i, e, not, due, to, black, body, radiation, and, approximately, 10, are, observed, to, also, have, jets, and, lobes, like, those, of, radio, galaxies, that, also, carry, significant, but, poorly, understood, amounts, of, energy, in, the, form, of, particles, moving, at, relativistic, speeds, extremely, high, energies, might, be, explained, by, several, mechanisms, see, fermi, acceleration, and, centrifugal, mechanism, of, acceleration, quasars, can, be, detected, over, the, entire, observable, electromagnetic, spectrum, including, radio, infrared, visible, light, ultraviolet, x, ray, and, even, gamma, rays, most, quasars, are, brightest, in, their, rest, frame, ultraviolet, wavelength, of, 121, 6, nm, lyman, alpha, emission, line, of, hydrogen, but, due, to, the, tremendous, redshifts, of, these, sources, that, peak, luminosity, has, been, observed, as, far, to, the, red, as, 900, 0, nm, in, the, near, infrared, a, minority, of, quasars, show, strong, radio, emission, which, is, generated, by, jets, of, matter, moving, close, to, the, speed, of, light, when, viewed, downward, these, appear, as, blazars, and, often, have, regions, that, seem, to, move, away, from, the, center, faster, than, the, speed, of, light, superluminal, expansion, this, is, an, optical, illusion, due, to, the, properties, of, special, relativity, quasar, redshifts, are, measured, from, the, strong, spectral, lines, that, dominate, their, visible, and, ultraviolet, emission, spectra, these, lines, are, brighter, than, the, continuous, spectrum, they, exhibit, doppler, broadening, corresponding, to, mean, speed, of, several, percent, of, the, speed, of, light, fast, motions, strongly, indicate, a, large, mass, emission, lines, of, hydrogen, mainly, of, the, lyman, series, and, balmer, series, helium, carbon, magnesium, iron, and, oxygen, are, the, brightest, lines, the, atoms, emitting, these, lines, range, from, neutral, to, highly, ionized, leaving, it, highly, charged, this, wide, range, of, ionization, shows, that, the, gas, is, highly, irradiated, by, the, quasar, not, merely, hot, and, not, by, stars, which, cannot, produce, such, a, wide, range, of, ionization, like, all, unobscured, active, galaxies, quasars, can, be, strong, x, ray, sources, radio, loud, quasars, can, also, produce, x, rays, and, gamma, rays, by, inverse, compton, scattering, of, lower, energy, photons, by, the, radio, emitting, electrons, in, the, jet, iron, quasars, show, strong, emission, lines, resulting, from, low, ionization, iron, fe, ii, such, as, iras, 18508, 7815, quasars, also, provide, some, clues, as, to, the, end, of, the, big, bang, s, reionization, the, oldest, known, quasars, z, 6, display, a, gunn, peterson, trough, and, have, absorption, regions, in, front, of, them, indicating, that, the, intergalactic, medium, at, that, time, was, neutral, gas, more, recent, quasars, show, no, absorption, region, but, rather, their, spectra, contain, a, spiky, area, known, as, the, lyman, alpha, forest, this, indicates, that, the, intergalactic, medium, has, undergone, reionization, into, plasma, and, that, neutral, gas, exists, only, in, small, clouds, the, intense, production, of, ionizing, ultraviolet, radiation, is, also, significant, as, it, would, provide, a, mechanism, for, reionization, to, occur, as, galaxies, form, despite, this, current, theories, suggest, that, quasars, were, not, the, primary, source, of, reionization, the, primary, causes, of, reionization, were, probably, the, earliest, generations, of, stars, known, as, population, iii, stars, possibly, 70, and, dwarf, galaxies, very, early, small, high, energy, galaxies, possibly, 30, quasars, show, evidence, of, elements, heavier, than, helium, indicating, that, galaxies, underwent, a, massive, phase, of, star, formation, creating, population, iii, stars, between, the, time, of, the, big, bang, and, the, first, observed, quasars, light, from, these, stars, may, have, been, observed, in, 2005, using, nasa, s, spitzer, space, telescope, although, this, observation, remains, to, be, confirmed, the, taxonomy, of, quasars, includes, various, subtypes, representing, subsets, of, the, quasar, population, having, distinct, properties, because, quasars, are, extremely, distant, bright, and, small, in, apparent, size, they, are, useful, reference, points, in, establishing, a, measurement, grid, on, the, sky, the, international, celestial, reference, system, icrs, is, based, on, hundreds, of, extra, galactic, radio, sources, mostly, quasars, distributed, around, the, entire, sky, because, they, are, so, distant, they, are, apparently, stationary, to, current, technology, yet, their, positions, can, be, measured, with, the, utmost, accuracy, by, very, long, baseline, interferometry, vlbi, the, positions, of, most, are, known, to, 0, 001, arcsecond, or, better, which, is, orders, of, magnitude, more, precise, than, the, best, optical, measurements, a, grouping, of, two, or, more, quasars, on, the, sky, can, result, from, a, chance, alignment, where, the, quasars, are, not, physically, associated, from, actual, physical, proximity, or, from, the, effects, of, gravity, bending, the, light, of, a, single, quasar, into, two, or, more, images, by, gravitational, lensing, when, two, quasars, appear, to, be, very, close, to, each, other, as, seen, from, earth, separated, by, a, few, arcseconds, or, less, they, are, commonly, referred, to, as, a, double, quasar, when, the, two, are, also, close, together, in, space, i, e, observed, to, have, similar, redshifts, they, are, termed, a, quasar, pair, or, as, a, binary, quasar, if, they, are, close, enough, that, their, host, galaxies, are, likely, to, be, physically, interacting, as, quasars, are, overall, rare, objects, in, the, universe, the, probability, of, three, or, more, separate, quasars, being, found, near, the, same, physical, location, is, very, low, and, determining, whether, the, system, is, closely, separated, physically, requires, significant, observational, effort, the, first, true, triple, quasar, was, found, in, 2007, by, observations, at, the, w, m, keck, observatory, in, mauna, kea, hawaii, lbqs, 1429, 008, or, qqq, j1432, 0106, was, first, observed, in, 1989, and, at, the, time, was, found, to, be, a, double, quasar, when, astronomers, discovered, the, third, member, they, confirmed, that, the, sources, were, separate, and, not, the, result, of, gravitational, lensing, this, triple, quasar, has, a, redshift, of, z, 2, 076, the, components, are, separated, by, an, estimated, 30, 50, kiloparsecs, roughly, 97, 000, 160, 000, light, years, which, is, typical, for, interacting, galaxies, in, 2013, the, second, true, triplet, of, quasars, qqq, j1519, 0627, was, found, with, a, redshift, z, 1, 51, the, whole, system, fitting, within, a, physical, separation, of, 25, kpc, about, 80, 000, light, years, the, first, true, quadruple, quasar, system, was, discovered, in, 2015, at, a, redshift, z, 2, 0412, and, has, an, overall, physical, scale, of, about, 200, kpc, roughly, 650, 000, light, years, a, multiple, image, quasar, is, a, quasar, whose, light, undergoes, gravitational, lensing, resulting, in, double, triple, or, quadruple, images, of, the, same, quasar, the, first, such, gravitational, lens, to, be, discovered, was, the, double, imaged, quasar, q0957, 561, or, twin, quasar, in, 1979, an, example, of, a, triply, lensed, quasar, is, pg1115, 08, several, quadruple, image, quasars, are, known, including, the, einstein, cross, and, the, cloverleaf, quasar, with, the, first, such, discoveries, happening, in, the, mid, 1980s
