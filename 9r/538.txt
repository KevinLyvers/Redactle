in, chemistry, a, solution, is, a, special, type, of, homogeneous, mixture, composed, of, two, or, more, substances, in, such, a, mixture, a, solute, is, a, substance, dissolved, in, another, substance, known, as, a, solvent, if, the, attractive, forces, between, the, solvent, and, solute, particles, are, greater, than, the, attractive, forces, holding, the, solute, particles, together, the, solvent, particles, pull, the, solute, particles, apart, and, surround, them, these, surrounded, solute, particles, then, move, away, from, the, solid, solute, and, out, into, the, solution, the, mixing, process, of, a, solution, happens, at, a, scale, where, the, effects, of, chemical, polarity, are, involved, resulting, in, interactions, that, are, specific, to, solvation, the, solution, usually, has, the, state, of, the, solvent, when, the, solvent, is, the, larger, fraction, of, the, mixture, as, is, commonly, the, case, one, important, parameter, of, a, solution, is, the, concentration, which, is, a, measure, of, the, amount, of, solute, in, a, given, amount, of, solution, or, solvent, the, term, aqueous, solution, is, used, when, one, of, the, solvents, is, water, homogeneous, means, that, the, components, of, the, mixture, form, a, single, phase, heterogeneous, means, that, the, components, of, the, mixture, are, of, different, phase, the, properties, of, the, mixture, such, as, concentration, temperature, and, density, can, be, uniformly, distributed, through, the, volume, but, only, in, absence, of, diffusion, phenomena, or, after, their, completion, usually, the, substance, present, in, the, greatest, amount, is, considered, the, solvent, solvents, can, be, gases, liquids, or, solids, one, or, more, components, present, in, the, solution, other, than, the, solvent, are, called, solutes, the, solution, has, the, same, physical, state, as, the, solvent, if, the, solvent, is, a, gas, only, gases, non, condensable, or, vapors, condensable, are, dissolved, under, a, given, set, of, conditions, an, example, of, a, gaseous, solution, is, air, oxygen, and, other, gases, dissolved, in, nitrogen, since, interactions, between, gaseous, molecules, play, almost, no, role, non, condensable, gases, form, rather, trivial, solutions, in, the, literature, they, are, not, even, classified, as, solutions, but, simply, addressed, as, homogeneous, mixtures, of, gases, the, brownian, motion, and, the, permanent, molecular, agitation, of, gas, molecules, guarantee, the, homogeneity, of, the, gaseous, systems, non, condensable, gaseous, mixtures, e, g, air, co, 2, or, air, xenon, do, not, spontaneously, demix, nor, sediment, as, distinctly, stratified, and, separate, gas, layers, as, a, function, of, their, relative, density, diffusion, forces, efficiently, counteract, gravitation, forces, under, normal, conditions, prevailing, on, earth, the, case, of, condensable, vapors, is, different, once, the, saturation, vapor, pressure, at, a, given, temperature, is, reached, vapor, excess, condenses, into, the, liquid, state, if, the, solvent, is, a, liquid, then, almost, all, gases, liquids, and, solids, can, be, dissolved, here, are, some, examples, counterexamples, are, provided, by, liquid, mixtures, that, are, not, homogeneous, colloids, suspensions, emulsions, are, not, considered, solutions, body, fluids, are, examples, of, complex, liquid, solutions, containing, many, solutes, many, of, these, are, electrolytes, since, they, contain, solute, ions, such, as, potassium, furthermore, they, contain, solute, molecules, like, sugar, and, urea, oxygen, and, carbon, dioxide, are, also, essential, components, of, blood, chemistry, where, significant, changes, in, their, concentrations, may, be, a, sign, of, severe, illness, or, injury, if, the, solvent, is, a, solid, then, gases, liquids, and, solids, can, be, dissolved, the, ability, of, one, compound, to, dissolve, in, another, compound, is, called, solubility, when, a, liquid, can, completely, dissolve, in, another, liquid, the, two, liquids, are, miscible, two, substances, that, can, never, mix, to, form, a, solution, are, said, to, be, immiscible, all, solutions, have, a, positive, entropy, of, mixing, the, interactions, between, different, molecules, or, ions, may, be, energetically, favored, or, not, if, interactions, are, unfavorable, then, the, free, energy, decreases, with, increasing, solute, concentration, at, some, point, the, energy, loss, outweighs, the, entropy, gain, and, no, more, solute, particles, can, be, dissolved, the, solution, is, said, to, be, saturated, however, the, point, at, which, a, solution, can, become, saturated, can, change, significantly, with, different, environmental, factors, such, as, temperature, pressure, and, contamination, for, some, solute, solvent, combinations, a, supersaturated, solution, can, be, prepared, by, raising, the, solubility, for, example, by, increasing, the, temperature, to, dissolve, more, solute, and, then, lowering, it, for, example, by, cooling, usually, the, greater, the, temperature, of, the, solvent, the, more, of, a, given, solid, solute, it, can, dissolve, however, most, gases, and, some, compounds, exhibit, solubilities, that, decrease, with, increased, temperature, such, behavior, is, a, result, of, an, exothermic, enthalpy, of, solution, some, surfactants, exhibit, this, behaviour, the, solubility, of, liquids, in, liquids, is, generally, less, temperature, sensitive, than, that, of, solids, or, gases, the, physical, properties, of, compounds, such, as, melting, point, and, boiling, point, change, when, other, compounds, are, added, together, they, are, called, colligative, properties, there, are, several, ways, to, quantify, the, amount, of, one, compound, dissolved, in, the, other, compounds, collectively, called, concentration, examples, include, molarity, volume, fraction, and, mole, fraction, the, properties, of, ideal, solutions, can, be, calculated, by, the, linear, combination, of, the, properties, of, its, components, if, both, solute, and, solvent, exist, in, equal, quantities, such, as, in, a, 50, ethanol, 50, water, solution, the, concepts, of, solute, and, solvent, become, less, relevant, but, the, substance, that, is, more, often, used, as, a, solvent, is, normally, designated, as, the, solvent, in, this, example, water, in, principle, all, types, of, liquids, can, behave, as, solvents, liquid, noble, gases, molten, metals, molten, salts, molten, covalent, networks, and, molecular, liquids, in, the, practice, of, chemistry, and, biochemistry, most, solvents, are, molecular, liquids, they, can, be, classified, into, polar, and, non, polar, according, to, whether, their, molecules, possess, a, permanent, electric, dipole, moment, another, distinction, is, whether, their, molecules, can, form, hydrogen, bonds, protic, and, aprotic, solvents, water, the, most, commonly, used, solvent, is, both, polar, and, sustains, hydrogen, bonds, salts, dissolve, in, polar, solvents, forming, positive, and, negative, ions, that, are, attracted, to, the, negative, and, positive, ends, of, the, solvent, molecule, respectively, if, the, solvent, is, water, hydration, occurs, when, the, charged, solute, ions, become, surrounded, by, water, molecules, a, standard, example, is, aqueous, saltwater, such, solutions, are, called, electrolytes, whenever, salt, dissolves, in, water, ion, association, has, to, be, taken, into, account, polar, solutes, dissolve, in, polar, solvents, forming, polar, bonds, or, hydrogen, bonds, as, an, example, all, alcoholic, beverages, are, aqueous, solutions, of, ethanol, on, the, other, hand, non, polar, solutes, dissolve, better, in, non, polar, solvents, examples, are, hydrocarbons, such, as, oil, and, grease, that, easily, mix, while, being, incompatible, with, water, an, example, of, the, immiscibility, of, oil, and, water, is, a, leak, of, petroleum, from, a, damaged, tanker, that, does, not, dissolve, in, the, ocean, water, but, rather, floats, on, the, surface, it, is, common, practice, in, laboratories, to, make, a, solution, directly, from, its, constituent, ingredients, there, are, three, cases, in, practical, calculation, in, the, following, equations, a, is, solvent, b, is, solute, and, c, is, concentration, solute, volume, contribution, is, considered, through, the, ideal, solution, model, example, make, 2, g, 100ml, of, nacl, solution, with, 1, l, water, the, density, of, the, resulting, solution, is, considered, to, be, equal, to, that, of, water, statement, holding, especially, for, dilute, solutions, so, the, density, information, is, not, required, chemists, often, make, concentrated, stock, solutions, that, may, then, be, diluted, as, needed, for, laboratory, applications, standard, solutions, are, those, where, concentrations, of, solutes, are, accurately, and, precisely, known
