schist, s, t, shist, is, a, medium, grained, metamorphic, rock, showing, pronounced, schistosity, this, means, that, the, rock, is, composed, of, mineral, grains, easily, seen, with, a, low, power, hand, lens, oriented, in, such, a, way, that, the, rock, is, easily, split, into, thin, flakes, or, plates, this, texture, reflects, a, high, content, of, platy, minerals, such, as, mica, talc, chlorite, or, graphite, these, are, often, interleaved, with, more, granular, minerals, such, as, feldspar, or, quartz, schist, typically, forms, during, regional, metamorphism, accompanying, the, process, of, mountain, building, orogeny, and, usually, reflects, a, medium, grade, of, metamorphism, schist, can, form, from, many, different, kinds, of, rocks, including, sedimentary, rocks, such, as, mudstones, and, igneous, rocks, such, as, tuffs, schist, metamorphosed, from, mudstone, is, particularly, common, and, is, often, very, rich, in, mica, a, mica, schist, where, the, type, of, the, original, rock, the, protolith, is, discernible, the, schist, is, usually, given, a, name, reflecting, its, protolith, such, as, schistose, metasandstone, otherwise, the, names, of, the, constituent, minerals, will, be, included, in, the, rock, name, such, as, quartz, felspar, biotite, schist, schist, bedrock, can, pose, a, challenge, for, civil, engineering, because, of, its, pronounced, planes, of, weakness, the, word, schist, is, derived, ultimately, from, the, greek, word, sch, zein, meaning, to, split, which, refers, to, the, ease, with, which, schists, can, be, split, along, the, plane, in, which, the, platy, minerals, lie, before, the, mid, 19th, century, the, terms, slate, shale, and, schist, were, not, sharply, differentiated, by, those, involved, with, mining, geologists, define, schist, as, medium, grained, metamorphic, rock, that, shows, well, developed, schistosity, schistosity, is, a, thin, layering, of, the, rock, produced, by, metamorphism, a, foliation, that, permits, the, rock, to, easily, be, split, into, flakes, or, slabs, less, than, 5, to, 10, millimeters, 0, 2, to, 0, 4, in, thick, the, mineral, grains, in, a, schist, are, typically, from, 0, 25, to, 2, millimeters, 0, 01, to, 0, 08, in, in, size, and, so, are, easily, seen, with, a, 10, hand, lens, typically, over, half, the, mineral, grains, in, a, schist, show, a, preferred, orientation, schists, make, up, one, of, the, three, divisions, of, metamorphic, rock, by, texture, with, the, other, two, divisions, being, gneiss, which, has, poorly, developed, schistosity, and, thicker, layering, and, granofels, which, has, no, discernible, schistosity, schists, are, defined, by, their, texture, without, reference, to, their, composition, and, while, most, are, a, result, of, medium, grade, metamorphism, they, can, vary, greatly, in, mineral, makeup, however, schistosity, normally, develops, only, when, the, rock, contains, abundant, platy, minerals, such, as, mica, or, chlorite, grains, of, these, minerals, are, strongly, oriented, in, a, preferred, direction, in, schist, often, also, forming, very, thin, parallel, layers, the, ease, with, which, the, rock, splits, along, the, aligned, grains, accounts, for, the, schistosity, though, not, a, defining, characteristic, schists, very, often, contain, porphyroblasts, individual, crystals, of, unusual, size, of, distinctive, minerals, such, as, garnet, staurolite, kyanite, sillimanite, or, cordierite, because, schists, are, a, very, large, class, of, metamorphic, rock, geologists, will, formally, describe, a, rock, as, a, schist, only, when, the, original, type, of, the, rock, prior, to, metamorphism, the, protolith, is, unknown, and, its, mineral, content, is, not, yet, determined, otherwise, the, modifier, schistose, will, be, applied, to, a, more, precise, type, name, such, as, schistose, semipelite, when, the, rock, is, known, to, contain, moderate, amounts, of, mica, or, a, schistose, metasandstone, if, the, protolith, is, known, to, have, been, a, sandstone, if, all, that, is, known, is, that, the, protolith, was, a, sedimentary, rock, the, schist, will, be, described, as, a, paraschist, while, if, the, protolith, was, an, igneous, rock, the, schist, will, be, described, as, an, orthoschist, mineral, qualifiers, are, important, when, naming, a, schist, for, example, a, quartz, feldspar, biotite, schist, is, a, schist, of, uncertain, protolith, that, contains, biotite, mica, feldspar, and, quartz, in, order, of, apparent, decreasing, abundance, lineated, schist, has, a, strong, linear, fabric, in, a, rock, which, otherwise, has, well, developed, schistosity, schistosity, is, developed, at, elevated, temperature, when, the, rock, is, more, strongly, compressed, in, one, direction, than, in, other, directions, nonhydrostatic, stress, nonhydrostatic, stress, is, characteristic, of, regional, metamorphism, where, mountain, building, is, taking, place, an, orogenic, belt, the, schistosity, develops, perpendicular, to, the, direction, of, greatest, compression, also, called, the, shortening, direction, as, platy, minerals, are, rotated, or, recrystallized, into, parallel, layers, while, platy, or, elongated, minerals, are, most, obviously, reoriented, even, quartz, or, calcite, may, take, up, preferred, orientations, at, the, microscopic, level, schistosity, is, divided, into, internal, schistosity, in, which, inclusions, within, porphyroblasts, take, a, preferred, orientation, and, external, schistosity, which, is, the, orientation, of, grains, in, the, surrounding, medium, grained, rock, the, composition, of, the, rock, must, permit, formation, of, abundant, platy, minerals, for, example, the, clay, minerals, in, mudstone, are, metamorphosed, to, mica, producing, a, mica, schist, early, stages, of, metamorphism, convert, mudstone, to, a, very, fine, grained, metamorphic, rock, called, slate, which, with, further, metamorphism, becomes, fine, grained, phyllite, further, recrystallization, produces, medium, grained, mica, schist, if, the, metamorphism, proceeds, further, the, mica, schist, experiences, dehydration, reactions, that, convert, platy, minerals, to, granular, minerals, such, as, feldspars, decreasing, schistosity, and, turning, the, rock, into, a, gneiss, other, platy, minerals, found, in, schists, include, chlorite, talc, and, graphite, chlorite, schist, is, typically, formed, by, metamorphism, of, ultramafic, igneous, rocks, as, is, talc, schist, talc, schist, also, forms, from, metamorphosis, of, talc, bearing, carbonate, rocks, formed, by, hydrothermal, alteration, graphite, schist, is, uncommon, but, can, form, from, metamorphosis, of, sedimentary, beds, containing, abundant, organic, carbon, this, may, be, of, algal, origin, graphite, schist, is, known, to, have, experienced, greenschist, facies, metamorphism, for, example, in, the, northern, andes, metamorphosis, of, felsic, volcanic, rock, such, as, tuff, can, produce, quartz, muscovite, schist, in, geotechnical, engineering, a, schistosity, plane, often, forms, a, discontinuity, that, may, have, a, large, influence, on, the, mechanical, behavior, strength, deformation, etc, of, rock, masses, in, for, example, tunnel, foundation, or, slope, construction, a, hazard, may, exist, even, in, undisturbed, terrain, on, august, 17, 1959, a, magnitude, 7, 2, earthquake, destabilized, a, mountain, slope, near, hebgen, lake, montana, composed, of, schist, this, caused, a, massive, landslide, that, killed, 26, people, camping, in, the, area
