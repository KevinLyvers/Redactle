https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)
the, pound, or, pound, mass, is, a, unit, of, mass, used, in, both, the, british, imperial, and, united, states, customary, systems, of, measurement, various, definitions, have, been, used, the, most, common, today, is, the, international, avoirdupois, pound, which, is, legally, defined, as, exactly, 0, 453, 592, 37, kilograms, and, which, is, divided, into, 16, avoirdupois, ounces, the, international, standard, symbol, for, the, avoirdupois, pound, is, lb, an, alternative, symbol, when, there, might, otherwise, be, a, risk, of, confusion, with, the, pound, force, is, lb, m, for, most, pound, definitions, chiefly, in, the, u, s, and, or, specifically, for, the, apothecaries, pound, the, unit, is, descended, from, the, roman, libra, hence, the, symbol, lb, descended, from, the, scribal, abbreviation, the, english, word, pound, comes, from, the, roman, libra, pondo, the, weight, measured, in, libra, and, is, cognate, with, among, others, german, pfund, dutch, pond, and, swedish, pund, these, units, are, now, designated, as, historical, and, are, no, longer, in, common, usage, being, replaced, by, the, metric, system, usage, of, the, unqualified, term, pound, reflects, the, historical, conflation, of, mass, and, weight, this, accounts, for, the, modern, distinguishing, terms, pound, mass, and, pound, force, the, word, pound, and, its, cognates, ultimately, derive, from, a, borrowing, into, proto, germanic, of, the, latin, expression, libra, pondo, the, weight, measured, in, libra, in, which, the, word, pondo, is, the, ablative, singular, of, the, latin, noun, pondus, weight, the, united, states, and, the, commonwealth, of, nations, agreed, upon, common, definitions, for, the, pound, and, the, yard, since, 1, july, 1959, the, international, avoirdupois, pound, symbol, lb, has, been, defined, as, exactly, 0, 453, 592, 37, kg, in, the, united, kingdom, the, use, of, the, international, pound, was, implemented, in, the, weights, and, measures, act, 1963, the, yard, or, the, metre, shall, be, the, unit, of, measurement, of, length, and, the, pound, or, the, kilogram, shall, be, the, unit, of, measurement, of, mass, by, reference, to, which, any, measurement, involving, a, measurement, of, length, or, mass, shall, be, made, in, the, united, kingdom, and, a, the, yard, shall, be, 0, 9144, metre, exactly, b, the, pound, shall, be, 0, 453, 592, 37, kilogram, exactly, an, avoirdupois, pound, is, equal, to, 16, avoirdupois, ounces, and, to, exactly, 7, 000, grains, the, conversion, factor, between, the, kilogram, and, the, international, pound, was, therefore, chosen, to, be, divisible, by, 7, with, a, terminating, decimal, representation, and, an, international, grain, is, thus, equal, to, exactly, 64, 798, 91, milligrams, in, the, united, kingdom, the, process, of, metrication, and, european, units, of, measurement, directives, were, expected, to, eliminate, the, use, of, the, pound, and, ounce, but, in, 2007, the, european, commission, abandoned, the, requirement, for, metric, only, labelling, on, packaged, goods, there, and, allowed, for, dual, metric, imperial, marking, to, continue, indefinitely, in, the, united, states, the, metric, conversion, act, of, 1975, declared, the, metric, system, to, be, the, preferred, system, of, weights, and, measures, but, did, not, suspend, use, of, united, states, customary, units, and, the, united, states, is, the, only, industrialised, country, where, commercial, activities, do, not, predominantly, use, the, metric, system, despite, many, efforts, to, do, so, and, the, pound, remains, widely, used, as, one, of, the, key, customary, units, historically, in, different, parts, of, the, world, at, different, points, in, time, and, for, different, applications, the, pound, or, its, translation, has, referred, to, broadly, similar, but, not, identical, standards, of, mass, or, force, the, libra, latin, for, scale, balance, is, an, ancient, roman, unit, of, mass, that, is, now, equivalent, to, 328, 9, g, 11, 60, oz, it, was, divided, into, 12, unciae, singular, uncia, or, ounces, the, libra, is, the, origin, of, the, abbreviation, for, pound, lb, a, number, of, different, definitions, of, the, pound, have, historically, been, used, in, britain, among, these, are, the, avoirdupois, pound, which, is, the, common, pound, used, for, weights, and, the, obsolete, tower, merchants, and, london, pounds, the, troy, pound, and, ounce, remain, in, use, only, for, the, weight, of, precious, metals, especially, in, their, trade, the, weights, of, traded, precious, metals, such, as, gold, and, silver, are, normally, quoted, just, in, ounces, e, g, 500, ounces, and, when, the, type, of, ounce, is, not, explicitly, stated, the, troy, system, is, assumed, the, pound, sterling, money, system, which, was, introduced, during, the, reign, of, king, offa, of, mercia, 757, 96, was, based, originally, on, a, saxon, pound, of, silver, after, the, norman, conquest, the, saxon, pound, was, known, as, the, tower, pound, or, moneyer, s, pound, in, 1528, during, the, reign, of, henry, viii, the, coinage, standard, was, changed, by, parliament, from, the, tower, pound, to, the, troy, pound, the, avoirdupois, pound, also, known, as, the, wool, pound, first, came, into, general, use, c, 1300, it, was, initially, equal, to, 6, 992, troy, grains, the, pound, avoirdupois, was, divided, into, 16, ounces, during, the, reign, of, queen, elizabeth, i, the, avoirdupois, pound, was, redefined, as, 7, 000, troy, grains, since, then, the, grain, has, often, been, an, integral, part, of, the, avoirdupois, system, by, 1758, two, elizabethan, exchequer, standard, weights, for, the, avoirdupois, pound, existed, and, when, measured, in, troy, grains, they, were, found, to, be, of, 7, 002, grains, and, 6, 999, grains, in, the, united, kingdom, weights, and, measures, have, been, defined, by, a, long, series, of, acts, of, parliament, the, intention, of, which, has, been, to, regulate, the, sale, of, commodities, materials, traded, in, the, marketplace, are, quantified, according, to, accepted, units, and, standards, in, order, to, avoid, fraud, the, standards, themselves, are, legally, defined, so, as, to, facilitate, the, resolution, of, disputes, brought, to, the, courts, only, legally, defined, measures, will, be, recognised, by, the, courts, quantifying, devices, used, by, traders, weights, weighing, machines, containers, of, volumes, measures, of, length, are, subject, to, official, inspection, and, penalties, apply, if, they, are, fraudulent, the, weights, and, measures, act, 1878, 41, 42, vict, c, 49, marked, a, major, overhaul, of, the, british, system, of, weights, and, measures, and, the, definition, of, the, pound, given, there, remained, in, force, until, the, 1960s, the, pound, was, defined, thus, section, 4, the, platinum, weight, deposited, in, the, standards, department, of, the, board, of, trade, shall, continue, to, be, the, imperial, standard, of, weight, and, the, said, platinum, weight, shall, continue, to, be, the, imperial, standard, for, determining, the, imperial, standard, pound, for, the, united, kingdom, paragraph, 13, states, that, the, weight, in, vacuo, of, this, standard, shall, be, called, the, imperial, standard, pound, and, that, all, other, weights, mentioned, in, the, act, and, permissible, for, commerce, shall, be, ascertained, from, it, alone, the, first, schedule, of, the, act, gave, more, details, of, the, standard, pound, it, is, a, platinum, cylinder, nearly, 1, 35, inches, 34, mm, high, and, 1, 15, inches, 29, mm, diameter, and, the, edges, are, carefully, rounded, off, it, has, a, groove, about, 0, 34, inches, 8, 6, mm, from, the, top, to, allow, the, cylinder, to, be, lifted, using, an, ivory, fork, it, was, constructed, following, the, destruction, of, the, houses, of, parliament, by, fire, in, 1834, and, is, stamped, p, s, 1844, 1, lb, p, s, stands, for, parliamentary, standard, the, british, weights, and, measures, act, 1878, 41, 42, vict, c, 49, said, that, contracts, worded, in, terms, of, metric, units, would, be, deemed, by, the, courts, to, be, made, according, to, the, imperial, units, defined, in, the, act, and, a, table, of, metric, equivalents, was, supplied, so, that, the, imperial, equivalents, could, be, legally, calculated, this, defined, in, uk, law, metric, units, in, terms, of, imperial, ones, the, equivalence, for, the, pound, was, given, as, 1, lb, 453, 592, 65, g, or, 0, 45359, kg, which, made, the, kilogram, equivalent, to, about, 2, 204, 6213, lb, in, 1883, it, was, determined, jointly, by, the, standards, department, of, the, british, board, of, trade, and, the, bureau, international, that, 0, 453, 592, 4277, kg, was, a, better, approximation, and, this, figure, rounded, to, 0, 453, 592, 43, kg, was, given, legal, status, by, an, order, in, council, in, may, 1898, in, 1959, based, on, further, measurements, and, international, coordination, the, international, yard, and, pound, agreement, defined, an, international, pound, as, being, equivalent, to, exactly, 0, 453, 592, 37, kg, this, meant, that, the, existing, legal, definition, of, the, uk, pound, differed, from, the, international, standard, pound, by, 0, 06, milligrams, to, remedy, this, the, pound, was, again, redefined, in, the, united, kingdom, by, the, weights, and, measures, act, 1963, to, match, the, international, pound, stating, the, pound, shall, be, 0, 453, 592, 37, kilogramme, exactly, a, definition, which, remains, valid, to, the, present, day, the, 2019, revision, of, the, si, means, that, the, pound, is, now, defined, precisely, in, terms, of, fundamental, constants, ending, the, era, of, its, definition, in, terms, of, physical, prototypes, a, troy, pound, abbreviated, lb, t, is, equal, to, 12, troy, ounces, and, to, 5, 760, grains, that, is, exactly, 373, 241, 7216, grams, troy, weights, were, used, in, england, by, jewellers, apothecaries, also, used, the, troy, pound, and, ounce, but, added, the, drachms, and, scruples, unit, in, the, apothecaries, system, of, weights, troy, weight, may, take, its, name, from, the, french, market, town, of, troyes, in, france, where, english, merchants, traded, at, least, as, early, as, the, early, 9th, century, the, troy, pound, is, no, longer, in, general, use, or, a, legal, unit, for, trade, it, was, abolished, in, the, united, kingdom, on, 6, january, 1879, by, the, weights, and, measures, act, 1878, but, the, troy, ounce, 1, 12, of, a, troy, pound, is, still, used, for, measurements, of, gems, such, as, opals, and, precious, metals, such, as, silver, platinum, and, particularly, gold, a, tower, pound, is, equal, to, 12, tower, ounces, and, to, 5, 400, troy, grains, which, equals, around, 350, grams, the, tower, pound, is, the, historical, weight, standard, that, was, used, for, england, s, coinage, before, the, norman, conquest, in, 1066, the, tower, pound, was, known, as, the, saxon, pound, during, the, reign, of, king, offa, 757, 96, of, mercia, a, saxon, pound, of, silver, was, used, to, set, the, original, weight, of, a, pound, sterling, from, one, saxon, pound, of, silver, that, is, a, tower, pound, the, king, had, 240, silver, pennies, minted, in, the, pound, sterling, monetary, system, twelve, pennies, equaled, a, shilling, and, twenty, shillings, equaled, a, pound, sterling, the, tower, pound, was, referenced, to, a, standard, prototype, found, in, the, tower, of, london, the, tower, system, ran, concurrently, with, the, avoirdupois, and, troy, systems, until, the, reign, of, henry, viii, when, a, royal, proclamation, dated, 1526, required, that, the, troy, pound, to, be, used, for, mint, purposes, instead, of, the, tower, pound, no, standards, of, the, tower, pound, are, known, to, have, survived, the, tower, pound, was, also, called, the, moneyers, pound, referring, to, the, saxon, moneyers, before, the, norman, conquest, the, easterling, pound, which, may, refer, to, traders, of, eastern, germany, or, to, traders, on, the, shore, of, the, eastern, baltic, sea, or, dealers, of, asiatic, goods, who, settled, at, the, london, steelyard, wharf, and, the, rochelle, pound, by, french, writers, because, it, was, also, in, use, at, la, rochelle, an, almost, identical, weight, was, employed, by, the, germans, for, weighing, gold, and, silver, the, mercantile, pound, 1304, of, 6750, troy, grains, or, 9600, tower, grains, derives, from, this, pound, as, 25, shilling, weights, or, 15, tower, ounces, for, general, commercial, use, multiple, pounds, based, on, the, same, ounce, were, quite, common, in, much, of, europe, the, apothecaries, and, commercial, pounds, were, different, numbers, of, the, same, ounce, the, merchants, pound, mercantile, pound, libra, mercantoria, or, commercial, pound, was, considered, to, be, composed, of, 25, rather, than, 20, tower, shillings, of, 12, pence, it, was, equal, to, 9, 600, wheat, grains, 15, tower, ounces, or, 6, 750, grains, and, was, used, in, england, until, the, 14th, century, for, goods, other, than, money, and, medicine, electuaries, the, london, pound, is, that, of, the, hansa, as, used, in, their, various, trading, places, the, london, pound, is, based, on, 16, ounces, each, ounce, divided, as, the, tower, ounce, it, never, became, a, legal, standard, in, england, the, use, of, this, pound, waxed, and, waned, with, the, influence, of, the, hansa, itself, a, london, pound, was, equal, to, 7, 200, troy, grains, 16, troy, ounces, or, equivalently, 10, 240, tower, grains, 16, tower, ounces, in, the, united, states, the, avoirdupois, pound, as, a, unit, of, mass, has, been, officially, defined, in, terms, of, the, kilogram, since, the, mendenhall, order, of, 1893, that, order, defined, the, pound, to, be, 2, 204, 62, pounds, to, a, kilogram, the, following, year, this, relationship, was, refined, as, 2, 204, 622, 34, pounds, to, a, kilogram, following, a, determination, of, the, british, pound, in, 1959, the, united, states, national, bureau, of, standards, redefined, the, pound, avoirdupois, to, be, exactly, equal, to, 0, 453, 592, 37, kilograms, as, had, been, declared, by, the, international, yard, and, pound, agreement, of, that, year, according, to, a, 1959, nist, publication, the, united, states, 1894, pound, differed, from, the, international, pound, by, approximately, one, part, in, 10, million, the, difference, is, so, insignificant, that, it, can, be, ignored, for, almost, all, practical, purposes, the, byzantines, used, a, series, of, measurements, known, as, pounds, latin, libra, ancient, greek, romanized, litra, the, most, common, was, the, logarik, litra, pound, of, account, established, by, constantine, the, great, in, 309, 310, it, formed, the, basis, of, the, byzantine, monetary, system, with, one, litra, of, gold, equivalent, to, 72, solidi, a, hundred, litrai, were, known, as, a, kent, narion, hundredweight, its, weight, seems, to, have, decreased, gradually, from, the, original, 324, g, 11, 4, oz, to, 319, g, 11, 3, oz, due, to, its, association, with, gold, it, was, also, known, as, the, chrysaphik, litra, gold, pound, or, thalassia, litra, maritime, pound, but, it, could, also, be, used, as, a, measure, of, land, equalling, a, fortieth, of, the, thalassios, modios, the, soualia, litra, was, specifically, used, for, weighing, olive, oil, or, wood, and, corresponded, to, 4, 5, of, the, logarik, or, 256, g, 9, 0, oz, some, outlying, regions, especially, in, later, times, adopted, various, local, measures, based, on, italian, arab, or, turkish, measures, the, most, important, of, these, was, the, argyrik, litra, silver, pound, of, 333, g, 11, 7, oz, found, in, trebizond, and, cyprus, and, probably, of, arab, origin, since, the, middle, ages, various, pounds, livre, have, been, used, in, france, since, the, 19th, century, a, livre, has, referred, to, the, metric, pound, 500, g, the, livre, esterlin, is, equivalent, to, about, 367, 1, grams, 5, 665, gr, and, was, used, between, the, late, 9th, century, and, the, mid, 14th, century, the, livre, poids, de, marc, or, livre, de, paris, is, equivalent, to, about, 489, 5, grams, 7, 554, gr, and, was, used, between, the, 1350s, and, the, late, 18th, century, it, was, introduced, by, the, government, of, john, ii, the, livre, m, trique, was, set, equal, to, the, kilogram, by, the, decree, of, 13, brumaire, an, ix, between, 1800, and, 1812, this, was, a, form, of, official, metric, pound, the, livre, usuelle, customary, unit, was, defined, as, 500, g, 18, oz, by, the, decree, of, 28, march, 1812, it, was, abolished, as, a, unit, of, mass, effective, 1, january, 1840, by, a, decree, of, 4, july, 1837, but, is, still, used, informally, originally, derived, from, the, roman, libra, the, definition, varied, throughout, the, holy, roman, empire, in, the, middle, ages, and, onward, for, example, the, measures, and, weights, of, the, habsburg, monarchy, were, reformed, in, 1761, by, empress, maria, theresa, of, austria, the, unusually, heavy, habsburg, civil, pound, of, 16, ounces, was, later, defined, in, terms, of, 560, 012, g, 19, 7538, oz, bavarian, reforms, in, 1809, and, 1811, adopted, essentially, the, same, standard, as, the, austrian, pound, in, prussia, a, reform, in, 1816, defined, a, uniform, civil, pound, in, terms, of, the, prussian, foot, and, distilled, water, resulting, in, a, prussian, pound, of, 467, 711, g, 16, 4980, oz, between, 1803, and, 1815, all, german, regions, west, of, the, river, rhine, were, under, french, control, organised, in, the, departements, roer, sarre, rhin, et, moselle, and, mont, tonnerre, as, a, result, of, the, congress, of, vienna, these, regions, again, became, part, of, various, german, states, however, many, of, these, regions, retained, the, metric, system, and, adopted, a, metric, pound, of, precisely, 500, g, 17, 64, oz, in, 1854, the, pound, of, 500, g, also, became, the, official, mass, standard, of, the, german, customs, union, and, was, renamed, the, zollpfund, but, local, pounds, continued, to, co, exist, with, the, zollverein, pound, for, some, time, in, some, german, states, nowadays, the, term, pfund, is, sometimes, still, in, use, and, universally, refers, to, a, pound, of, 500, g, the, russian, pound, funt, is, an, obsolete, russian, unit, of, measurement, of, mass, it, is, equal, to, 409, 51718, g, 14, 445293, oz, in, 1899, the, funt, was, the, basic, unit, of, weight, and, all, other, units, of, weight, were, formed, from, it, in, particular, a, zolotnik, was, 1, 96, of, a, funt, and, a, pood, was, 40, f, nty, the, sk, lpund, was, a, scandinavian, measurement, that, varied, in, weight, between, regions, from, the, 17th, century, onward, it, was, equal, to, 425, 076, g, 14, 9941, oz, in, sweden, but, was, abandoned, in, 1889, when, sweden, switched, to, the, metric, system, in, norway, the, same, name, was, used, for, a, weight, of, 425, 076, g, 14, 9941, oz, in, denmark, it, equaled, 471, g, 16, 6, oz, in, the, 19th, century, denmark, followed, germany, s, lead, and, redefined, the, pound, as, 500, g, 18, oz, the, portuguese, unit, that, corresponds, to, the, pounds, of, different, nations, is, the, arr, tel, equivalent, to, 16, ounces, of, colonha, a, variant, of, the, cologne, standard, this, arr, tel, was, introduced, in, 1499, by, manuel, i, king, of, portugal, based, on, an, evaluation, of, bronze, nesting, weight, piles, distributed, by, manuel, i, to, different, towns, the, arr, tel, of, manuel, i, has, been, estimated, to, be, of, 457, 8, g, 16, 15, oz, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, arr, tel, was, evaluated, at, 459, g, 16, 2, oz, in, the, 15th, century, the, arr, tel, was, of, 14, ounces, of, colonha, or, 400, 6, g, 14, 13, oz, the, portuguese, libra, was, the, same, as, 2, arr, teis, there, were, also, arr, teis, of, 12, 5, and, 13, ounces, and, libras, of, 15, and, 16, ounces, the, troyes, or, tria, standard, was, also, used, a, jersey, pound, is, an, obsolete, unit, of, mass, used, on, the, island, of, jersey, from, the, 14th, century, to, the, 19th, century, it, was, equivalent, to, about, 7, 561, grains, 490, g, 17, oz, it, may, have, been, derived, from, the, french, livre, poids, de, marc, the, trone, pound, is, one, of, a, number, of, obsolete, scottish, units, of, measurement, it, was, equivalent, to, between, 21, and, 28, avoirdupois, ounces, about, 600, 800, g, 21, 28, oz, in, many, countries, upon, the, introduction, of, a, metric, system, the, pound, or, its, translation, became, an, historic, and, obsolete, term, although, some, have, kept, it, as, an, informal, term, without, a, specific, value, in, german, the, term, is, pfund, in, french, livre, in, dutch, pond, in, spanish, and, portuguese, libra, in, italian, libbra, and, in, danish, and, swedish, pund, though, not, from, the, same, linguistic, origin, the, chinese, j, n, also, known, as, the, catty, in, mainland, china, has, a, modern, definition, of, exactly, 500, g, 18, oz, divided, into, 10, li, ng, traditionally, around, 600, g, 21, oz, the, jin, has, been, in, use, for, more, than, two, thousand, years, varying, in, exact, value, from, one, period, to, another, serving, the, same, purpose, as, pound, for, the, common, use, measure, of, weight, in, hong, kong, for, the, purposes, of, commerce, and, trade, between, britain, and, imperial, china, in, the, preceding, centuries, three, chinese, catties, were, equivalent, to, four, british, imperial, pounds, defining, one, catty, as, 604, 78982, g, 21, 333333, oz, in, weight, precisely, hundreds, of, older, pounds, were, replaced, in, this, way, examples, of, the, older, pounds, are, one, of, around, 459, 460, g, 16, 19, 16, 23, oz, in, spain, portugal, and, latin, america, one, of, 498, 1, g, 17, 57, oz, in, norway, and, several, different, ones, in, what, is, now, germany, from, the, introduction, of, the, kilogram, scales, and, measuring, devices, are, denominated, only, in, grams, and, kilograms, a, pound, of, product, must, be, determined, by, weighing, the, product, in, grams, as, the, use, of, the, pound, is, not, sanctioned, for, trade, within,
