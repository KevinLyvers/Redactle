electrostatics, is, a, branch, of, physics, that, studies, slow, moving, or, stationary, electric, charges, since, classical, times, it, has, been, known, that, some, materials, such, as, amber, attract, lightweight, particles, after, rubbing, the, greek, word, for, amber, lektron, was, thus, the, source, of, the, word, electricity, electrostatic, phenomena, arise, from, the, forces, that, electric, charges, exert, on, each, other, such, forces, are, described, by, coulomb, s, law, there, are, many, examples, of, electrostatic, phenomena, from, those, as, simple, as, the, attraction, of, plastic, wrap, to, one, s, hand, after, it, is, removed, from, a, package, to, the, apparently, spontaneous, explosion, of, grain, silos, the, damage, of, electronic, components, during, manufacturing, and, photocopier, and, laser, printer, operation, the, electrostatic, model, accurately, predicts, electrical, phenomena, in, classical, cases, where, the, velocities, are, low, and, the, system, is, macroscopic, so, no, quantum, effects, are, involved, it, also, plays, a, role, in, quantum, mechanics, where, additional, terms, also, need, to, be, included, coulomb, s, law, states, that, the, magnitude, of, the, electrostatic, force, of, attraction, or, repulsion, between, two, point, charges, is, directly, proportional, to, the, product, of, the, magnitudes, of, charges, and, inversely, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, distance, between, them, the, force, is, along, the, straight, line, joining, them, if, the, two, charges, have, the, same, sign, the, electrostatic, force, between, them, is, repulsive, if, they, have, different, signs, the, force, between, them, is, attractive, if, r, displaystyle, r, is, the, distance, in, meters, between, two, charges, then, the, force, between, two, point, charges, q, displaystyle, q, and, q, displaystyle, q, is, where, 0, 8, 854, 187, 8188, 14, 10, 12, f, m, 1, is, the, vacuum, permittivity, the, si, unit, of, 0, is, equivalently, a, 2, s, 4, kg, 1, m, 3, or, c, 2, n, 1, m, 2, or, f, m, 1, the, electric, field, e, displaystyle, mathbf, e, in, units, of, newtons, per, coulomb, or, volts, per, meter, is, a, vector, field, that, can, be, defined, everywhere, except, at, the, location, of, point, charges, where, it, diverges, to, infinity, it, is, defined, as, the, electrostatic, force, displaystyle, mathbf, on, a, hypothetical, small, test, charge, at, the, point, due, to, coulomb, s, law, divided, by, the, charge, q, displaystyle, q, electric, field, lines, are, useful, for, visualizing, the, electric, field, field, lines, begin, on, positive, charge, and, terminate, on, negative, charge, they, are, parallel, to, the, direction, of, the, electric, field, at, each, point, and, the, density, of, these, field, lines, is, a, measure, of, the, magnitude, of, the, electric, field, at, any, given, point, consider, a, collection, of, n, displaystyle, n, particles, of, charge, q, i, displaystyle, q, i, located, at, points, r, i, displaystyle, mathbf, r, i, called, source, points, the, electric, field, at, r, displaystyle, mathbf, r, called, the, field, point, is, where, r, i, r, r, i, textstyle, mathbf, r, i, mathbf, r, mathbf, r, i, is, the, displacement, vector, from, a, source, point, r, i, displaystyle, mathbf, r, i, to, the, field, point, r, displaystyle, mathbf, r, and, r, i, d, e, f, r, i, r, i, textstyle, hat, mathbf, r, i, stackrel, mathrm, def, frac, mathbf, r, i, mathbf, r, i, is, a, unit, vector, that, indicates, the, direction, of, the, field, for, a, single, point, charge, at, the, origin, the, magnitude, of, this, electric, field, is, e, q, 4, 0, r, 2, displaystyle, e, q, 4, pi, varepsilon, 0, r, 2, and, points, away, from, that, charge, if, it, is, positive, the, fact, that, the, force, and, hence, the, field, can, be, calculated, by, summing, over, all, the, contributions, due, to, individual, source, particles, is, an, example, of, the, superposition, principle, the, electric, field, produced, by, a, distribution, of, charges, is, given, by, the, volume, charge, density, r, displaystyle, rho, mathbf, r, and, can, be, obtained, by, converting, this, sum, into, a, triple, integral, gauss, s, law, states, that, the, total, electric, flux, through, any, closed, surface, in, free, space, of, any, shape, drawn, in, an, electric, field, is, proportional, to, the, total, electric, charge, enclosed, by, the, surface, many, numerical, problems, can, be, solved, by, considering, a, gaussian, surface, around, a, body, mathematically, gauss, s, law, takes, the, form, of, an, integral, equation, where, d, 3, r, d, x, d, y, d, z, displaystyle, mathrm, d, 3, r, mathrm, d, x, mathrm, d, y, mathrm, d, z, is, a, volume, element, if, the, charge, is, distributed, over, a, surface, or, along, a, line, replace, d, 3, r, displaystyle, rho, mathrm, d, 3, r, by, d, a, displaystyle, sigma, mathrm, d, a, or, d, displaystyle, lambda, mathrm, d, ell, the, divergence, theorem, allows, gauss, s, law, to, be, written, in, differential, form, where, displaystyle, nabla, cdot, is, the, divergence, operator, the, definition, of, electrostatic, potential, combined, with, the, differential, form, of, gauss, s, law, above, provides, a, relationship, between, the, potential, and, the, charge, density, this, relationship, is, a, form, of, poisson, s, equation, in, the, absence, of, unpaired, electric, charge, the, equation, becomes, laplace, s, equation, the, validity, of, the, electrostatic, approximation, rests, on, the, assumption, that, the, electric, field, is, irrotational, from, faraday, s, law, this, assumption, implies, the, absence, or, near, absence, of, time, varying, magnetic, fields, in, other, words, electrostatics, does, not, require, the, absence, of, magnetic, fields, or, electric, currents, rather, if, magnetic, fields, or, electric, currents, do, exist, they, must, not, change, with, time, or, in, the, worst, case, they, must, change, with, time, only, very, slowly, in, some, problems, both, electrostatics, and, magnetostatics, may, be, required, for, accurate, predictions, but, the, coupling, between, the, two, can, still, be, ignored, electrostatics, and, magnetostatics, can, both, be, seen, as, non, relativistic, galilean, limits, for, electromagnetism, in, addition, conventional, electrostatics, ignore, quantum, effects, which, have, to, be, added, for, a, complete, description, 2, as, the, electric, field, is, irrotational, it, is, possible, to, express, the, electric, field, as, the, gradient, of, a, scalar, function, displaystyle, phi, called, the, electrostatic, potential, also, known, as, the, voltage, an, electric, field, e, displaystyle, e, points, from, regions, of, high, electric, potential, to, regions, of, low, electric, potential, expressed, mathematically, as, the, gradient, theorem, can, be, used, to, establish, that, the, electrostatic, potential, is, the, amount, of, work, per, unit, charge, required, to, move, a, charge, from, point, a, displaystyle, a, to, point, b, displaystyle, b, with, the, following, line, integral, from, these, equations, we, see, that, the, electric, potential, is, constant, in, any, region, for, which, the, electric, field, vanishes, such, as, occurs, inside, a, conducting, object, a, test, particle, s, potential, energy, u, e, single, displaystyle, u, mathrm, e, text, single, can, be, calculated, from, a, line, integral, of, the, work, q, n, e, d, displaystyle, q, n, mathbf, e, cdot, mathrm, d, mathbf, ell, we, integrate, from, a, point, at, infinity, and, assume, a, collection, of, n, displaystyle, n, particles, of, charge, q, n, displaystyle, q, n, are, already, situated, at, the, points, r, i, displaystyle, mathbf, r, i, this, potential, energy, in, joules, is, where, r, i, r, r, i, displaystyle, mathbf, mathcal, r, i, mathbf, r, mathbf, r, i, is, the, distance, of, each, charge, q, i, displaystyle, q, i, from, the, test, charge, q, displaystyle, q, which, situated, at, the, point, r, displaystyle, mathbf, r, and, r, displaystyle, phi, mathbf, r, is, the, electric, potential, that, would, be, at, r, displaystyle, mathbf, r, if, the, test, charge, were, not, present, if, only, two, charges, are, present, the, potential, energy, is, q, 1, q, 2, 4, 0, r, displaystyle, q, 1, q, 2, 4, pi, varepsilon, 0, r, the, total, electric, potential, energy, due, a, collection, of, n, charges, is, calculating, by, assembling, these, particles, one, at, a, time, where, the, following, sum, from, j, 1, to, n, excludes, i, j, this, electric, potential, i, displaystyle, phi, i, is, what, would, be, measured, at, r, i, displaystyle, mathbf, r, i, if, the, charge, q, i, displaystyle, q, i, were, missing, this, formula, obviously, excludes, the, infinite, energy, that, would, be, required, to, assemble, each, point, charge, from, a, disperse, cloud, of, charge, the, sum, over, charges, can, be, converted, into, an, integral, over, charge, density, using, the, prescription, d, 3, r, textstyle, sum, cdots, rightarrow, int, cdots, rho, mathrm, d, 3, r, this, second, expression, for, electrostatic, energy, uses, the, fact, that, the, electric, field, is, the, negative, gradient, of, the, electric, potential, as, well, as, vector, calculus, identities, in, a, way, that, resembles, integration, by, parts, these, two, integrals, for, electric, field, energy, seem, to, indicate, two, mutually, exclusive, formulas, for, electrostatic, energy, density, namely, 1, 2, textstyle, frac, 1, 2, rho, phi, and, 1, 2, 0, e, 2, textstyle, frac, 1, 2, varepsilon, 0, e, 2, they, yield, equal, values, for, the, total, electrostatic, energy, only, if, both, are, integrated, over, all, space, on, a, conductor, a, surface, charge, will, experience, a, force, in, the, presence, of, an, electric, field, this, force, is, the, average, of, the, discontinuous, electric, field, at, the, surface, charge, this, average, in, terms, of, the, field, just, outside, the, surface, amounts, to, this, pressure, tends, to, draw, the, conductor, into, the, field,
