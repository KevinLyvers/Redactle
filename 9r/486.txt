sodium, sulfate, also, known, as, sodium, sulphate, or, sulfate, of, soda, is, the, inorganic, compound, with, formula, na, 2, so, 4, as, well, as, several, related, hydrates, all, forms, are, white, solids, that, are, highly, soluble, in, water, with, an, annual, production, of, 6, million, tonnes, the, decahydrate, is, a, major, commodity, chemical, product, it, is, mainly, used, as, a, filler, in, the, manufacture, of, powdered, home, laundry, detergents, and, in, the, kraft, process, of, paper, pulping, for, making, highly, alkaline, sulfides, the, decahydrate, of, sodium, sulfate, is, known, as, glauber, s, salt, after, the, dutch, german, chemist, and, apothecary, johann, rudolf, glauber, 1604, 1670, who, discovered, it, in, austrian, spring, water, in, 1625, he, named, it, sal, mirabilis, miraculous, salt, because, of, its, medicinal, properties, the, crystals, were, used, as, a, general, purpose, laxative, until, more, sophisticated, alternatives, came, about, in, the, 1900s, however, j, kunckel, later, alleged, that, it, was, known, as, a, secret, medicine, in, saxony, already, in, the, mid, 16th, century, in, the, 18th, century, glauber, s, salt, began, to, be, used, as, a, raw, material, for, the, industrial, production, of, soda, ash, sodium, carbonate, by, reaction, with, potash, potassium, carbonate, demand, for, soda, ash, increased, and, the, supply, of, sodium, sulfate, had, to, increase, in, line, therefore, in, the, 19th, century, the, large, scale, leblanc, process, producing, synthetic, sodium, sulfate, as, a, key, intermediate, became, the, principal, method, of, soda, ash, production, sodium, sulfate, is, a, typical, electrostatically, bonded, ionic, sulfate, the, existence, of, free, sulfate, ions, in, solution, is, indicated, by, the, easy, formation, of, insoluble, sulfates, when, these, solutions, are, treated, with, ba, 2, or, pb, 2, salts, sodium, sulfate, is, unreactive, toward, most, oxidizing, or, reducing, agents, at, high, temperatures, it, can, be, converted, to, sodium, sulfide, by, carbothermal, reduction, aka, thermo, chemical, sulfate, reduction, tsr, high, temperature, heating, with, charcoal, etc, this, reaction, was, employed, in, the, leblanc, process, a, defunct, industrial, route, to, sodium, carbonate, sodium, sulfate, reacts, with, sulfuric, acid, to, give, the, acid, salt, sodium, bisulfate, sodium, sulfate, displays, a, moderate, tendency, to, form, double, salts, the, only, alums, formed, with, common, trivalent, metals, are, naal, so, 4, 2, unstable, above, 39, c, and, nacr, so, 4, 2, in, contrast, to, potassium, sulfate, and, ammonium, sulfate, which, form, many, stable, alums, double, salts, with, some, other, alkali, metal, sulfates, are, known, including, na, 2, so, 4, 3k, 2, so, 4, which, occurs, naturally, as, the, mineral, aphthitalite, formation, of, glaserite, by, reaction, of, sodium, sulfate, with, potassium, chloride, has, been, used, as, the, basis, of, a, method, for, producing, potassium, sulfate, a, fertiliser, other, double, salts, include, 3na, 2, so, 4, caso, 4, 3na, 2, so, 4, mgso, 4, vanthoffite, and, naf, na, 2, so, 4, sodium, sulfate, has, unusual, solubility, characteristics, in, water, its, solubility, in, water, rises, more, than, tenfold, between, 0, c, and, 32, 384, c, where, it, reaches, a, maximum, of, 49, 7, g, 100, ml, at, this, point, the, solubility, curve, changes, slope, and, the, solubility, becomes, almost, independent, of, temperature, this, temperature, of, 32, 384, c, corresponding, to, the, release, of, crystal, water, and, melting, of, the, hydrated, salt, serves, as, an, accurate, temperature, reference, for, thermometer, calibration, crystals, of, the, decahydrate, consist, of, ions, with, octahedral, molecular, geometry, these, octahedra, share, edges, such, that, 8, of, the, 10, water, molecules, are, bound, to, sodium, and, 2, others, are, interstitial, being, hydrogen, bonded, to, sulfate, these, cations, are, linked, to, the, sulfate, anions, by, hydrogen, bonds, the, na, o, distances, are, about, 240, pm, crystalline, sodium, sulfate, decahydrate, is, also, unusual, among, hydrated, salts, in, having, a, measurable, residual, entropy, entropy, at, absolute, zero, of, 6, 32, j, k, mol, this, is, ascribed, to, its, ability, to, distribute, water, much, more, rapidly, compared, to, most, hydrates, the, world, production, of, sodium, sulfate, almost, exclusively, in, the, form, of, the, decahydrate, amounts, to, approximately, 5, 5, to, 6, million, tonnes, annually, mt, a, in, 1985, production, was, 4, 5, mt, a, half, from, natural, sources, and, half, from, chemical, production, after, 2000, at, a, stable, level, until, 2006, natural, production, had, increased, to, 4, mt, a, and, chemical, production, decreased, to, 1, 5, to, 2, mt, a, with, a, total, of, 5, 5, to, 6, mt, a, for, all, applications, naturally, produced, and, chemically, produced, sodium, sulfate, are, practically, interchangeable, two, thirds, of, the, world, s, production, of, the, decahydrate, glauber, s, salt, is, from, the, natural, mineral, form, mirabilite, for, example, as, found, in, lake, beds, in, southern, saskatchewan, in, 1990, mexico, and, spain, were, the, world, s, main, producers, of, natural, sodium, sulfate, each, around, 500, 000, tonnes, with, russia, united, states, and, canada, around, 350, 000, tonnes, each, natural, resources, are, estimated, at, over, 1, billion, tonnes, major, producers, of, 200, 000, to, 1, 500, 000, tonnes, year, in, 2006, included, searles, valley, minerals, california, us, airborne, industrial, minerals, saskatchewan, canada, qu, mica, del, rey, coahuila, mexico, minera, de, santa, marta, and, criaderos, minerales, y, derivados, also, known, as, grupo, crimidesa, burgos, spain, minera, de, santa, marta, toledo, spain, sulquisa, madrid, spain, chengdu, sanlian, tianquan, chemical, tianquan, county, sichuan, china, hongze, yinzhu, chemical, group, hongze, district, jiangsu, china, nafine, chemical, industry, group, shanxi, china, sichuan, province, chuanmei, mirabilite, dongpo, district, meishan, sichuan, china, and, kuchuksulphat, jsc, altai, krai, siberia, russia, anhydrous, sodium, sulfate, occurs, in, arid, environments, as, the, mineral, thenardite, it, slowly, turns, to, mirabilite, in, damp, air, sodium, sulfate, is, also, found, as, glauberite, a, calcium, sodium, sulfate, mineral, both, minerals, are, less, common, than, mirabilite, about, one, third, of, the, world, s, sodium, sulfate, is, produced, as, by, product, of, other, processes, in, chemical, industry, most, of, this, production, is, chemically, inherent, to, the, primary, process, and, only, marginally, economical, by, effort, of, the, industry, therefore, sodium, sulfate, production, as, by, product, is, declining, the, most, important, chemical, sodium, sulfate, production, is, during, hydrochloric, acid, production, either, from, sodium, chloride, salt, and, sulfuric, acid, in, the, mannheim, process, or, from, sulfur, dioxide, in, the, hargreaves, process, the, resulting, sodium, sulfate, from, these, processes, is, known, as, salt, cake, the, second, major, production, of, sodium, sulfate, are, the, processes, where, surplus, sodium, hydroxide, is, neutralised, by, sulfuric, acid, to, obtain, sulfate, so, 2, 4, by, using, copper, sulfate, cuso, 4, as, historically, applied, on, a, large, scale, in, the, production, of, rayon, by, using, copper, ii, hydroxide, this, method, is, also, a, regularly, applied, and, convenient, laboratory, preparation, in, the, laboratory, it, can, also, be, synthesized, from, the, reaction, between, sodium, bicarbonate, and, magnesium, sulfate, by, precipitating, magnesium, carbonate, however, as, commercial, sources, are, readily, available, laboratory, synthesis, is, not, practised, often, formerly, sodium, sulfate, was, also, a, by, product, of, the, manufacture, of, sodium, dichromate, where, sulfuric, acid, is, added, to, sodium, chromate, solution, forming, sodium, dichromate, or, subsequently, chromic, acid, alternatively, sodium, sulfate, is, or, was, formed, in, the, production, of, lithium, carbonate, chelating, agents, resorcinol, ascorbic, acid, silica, pigments, nitric, acid, and, phenol, bulk, sodium, sulfate, is, usually, purified, via, the, decahydrate, form, since, the, anhydrous, form, tends, to, attract, iron, compounds, and, organic, compounds, the, anhydrous, form, is, easily, produced, from, the, hydrated, form, by, gentle, warming, major, sodium, sulfate, by, product, producers, of, 50, 80, mt, a, in, 2006, include, elementis, chromium, chromium, industry, castle, hayne, nc, us, lenzing, ag, 200, mt, a, rayon, industry, lenzing, austria, addiseo, formerly, rhodia, methionine, industry, les, roches, roussillon, france, elementis, chromium, industry, stockton, on, tees, uk, shikoku, chemicals, tokushima, japan, and, visko, r, rayon, industry, russia, with, us, pricing, at, 30, per, tonne, in, 1970, up, to, 90, per, tonne, for, salt, cake, quality, and, 130, for, better, grades, sodium, sulphate, is, a, very, cheap, material, the, largest, use, is, as, filler, in, powdered, home, laundry, detergents, consuming, approximately, 50, of, world, production, this, use, is, waning, as, domestic, consumers, are, increasingly, switching, to, compact, or, liquid, detergents, that, do, not, include, sodium, sulfate, another, formerly, major, use, for, sodium, sulfate, notably, in, the, us, and, canada, is, in, the, kraft, process, for, the, manufacture, of, wood, pulp, organics, present, in, the, black, liquor, from, this, process, are, burnt, to, produce, heat, needed, to, drive, the, reduction, of, sodium, sulfate, to, sodium, sulfide, however, due, to, advances, in, the, thermal, efficiency, of, the, kraft, recovery, process, in, the, early, 1960s, more, efficient, sulfur, recovery, was, achieved, and, the, need, for, sodium, sulfate, makeup, was, drastically, reduced, hence, the, use, of, sodium, sulfate, in, the, us, and, canadian, pulp, industry, declined, from, 1, 400, 000, tonnes, per, year, in, 1970, to, only, approx, 150, 000, tonnes, in, 2006, the, glass, industry, provides, another, significant, application, for, sodium, sulfate, as, second, largest, application, in, europe, sodium, sulfate, is, used, as, a, fining, agent, to, help, remove, small, air, bubbles, from, molten, glass, it, fluxes, the, glass, and, prevents, scum, formation, of, the, glass, melt, during, refining, the, glass, industry, in, europe, has, been, consuming, from, 1970, to, 2006, a, stable, 110, 000, tonnes, annually, sodium, sulfate, is, important, in, the, manufacture, of, textiles, particularly, in, japan, where, this, is, the, largest, application, sodium, sulfate, is, added, to, increase, the, ionic, strength, of, the, solution, and, so, helps, in, levelling, i, e, reducing, negative, electrical, charges, on, textile, fibres, so, that, dyes, can, penetrate, evenly, see, the, theory, of, the, diffuse, double, layer, ddl, elaborated, by, gouy, and, chapman, unlike, the, alternative, sodium, chloride, it, does, not, corrode, the, stainless, steel, vessels, used, in, dyeing, this, application, in, japan, and, us, consumed, in, 2006, approximately, 100, 000, tonnes, sodium, sulfate, is, used, as, a, diluent, for, food, colours, it, is, known, as, e, number, additive, e514, the, high, heat, storage, capacity, in, the, phase, change, from, solid, to, liquid, and, the, advantageous, phase, change, temperature, of, 32, c, 90, f, makes, this, material, especially, appropriate, for, storing, low, grade, solar, heat, for, later, release, in, space, heating, applications, in, some, applications, the, material, is, incorporated, into, thermal, tiles, that, are, placed, in, an, attic, space, while, in, other, applications, the, salt, is, incorporated, into, cells, surrounded, by, solar, heated, water, the, phase, change, allows, a, substantial, reduction, in, the, mass, of, the, material, required, for, effective, heat, storage, the, heat, of, fusion, of, sodium, sulfate, decahydrate, is, 82, kj, mol, or, 252, kj, kg, with, the, further, advantage, of, a, consistency, of, temperature, as, long, as, sufficient, material, in, the, appropriate, phase, is, available, for, cooling, applications, a, mixture, with, common, sodium, chloride, salt, nacl, lowers, the, melting, point, to, 18, c, 64, f, the, heat, of, fusion, of, nacl, na, 2, so, 4, 10h, 2, o, is, actually, increased, slightly, to, 286, kj, kg, in, the, laboratory, anhydrous, sodium, sulfate, is, widely, used, as, an, inert, drying, agent, for, removing, traces, of, water, from, organic, solutions, it, is, more, efficient, but, slower, acting, than, the, similar, agent, magnesium, sulfate, it, is, only, effective, below, about, 30, c, 86, f, but, it, can, be, used, with, a, variety, of, materials, since, it, is, chemically, fairly, inert, sodium, sulfate, is, added, to, the, solution, until, the, crystals, no, longer, clump, together, the, two, video, clips, see, above, demonstrate, how, the, crystals, clump, when, still, wet, but, some, crystals, flow, freely, once, a, sample, is, dry, glauber, s, salt, the, decahydrate, is, used, as, a, laxative, it, is, effective, for, the, removal, of, certain, drugs, such, as, paracetamol, acetaminophen, from, the, body, thus, it, can, be, used, after, an, overdose, in, 1953, sodium, sulfate, was, proposed, for, heat, storage, in, passive, solar, heating, systems, this, takes, advantage, of, its, unusual, solubility, properties, and, the, high, heat, of, crystallisation, 78, 2, kj, mol, other, uses, for, sodium, sulfate, include, de, frosting, windows, starch, manufacture, as, an, additive, in, carpet, fresheners, and, as, an, additive, to, cattle, feed, at, least, one, company, thermaltake, makes, a, laptop, computer, chill, mat, ixoft, notebook, cooler, using, sodium, sulfate, decahydrate, inside, a, quilted, plastic, pad, the, material, slowly, turns, to, liquid, and, recirculates, equalizing, laptop, temperature, and, acting, as, an, insulation, although, sodium, sulfate, is, generally, regarded, as, non, toxic, it, should, be, handled, with, care, the, dust, can, cause, temporary, asthma, or, eye, irritation, this, risk, can, be, prevented, by, using, eye, protection, and, a, paper, mask, transport, is, not, limited, and, no, risk, phrase, or, safety, phrase, applies
