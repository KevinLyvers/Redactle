a, unit, of, measurement, or, unit, of, measure, is, a, definite, magnitude, of, a, quantity, defined, and, adopted, by, convention, or, by, law, that, is, used, as, a, standard, for, measurement, of, the, same, kind, of, quantity, any, other, quantity, of, that, kind, can, be, expressed, as, a, multiple, of, the, unit, of, measurement, for, example, a, length, is, a, physical, quantity, the, metre, symbol, m, is, a, unit, of, length, that, represents, a, definite, predetermined, length, for, instance, when, referencing, 10, metres, or, 10, m, what, is, actually, meant, is, 10, times, the, definite, predetermined, length, called, metre, the, definition, agreement, and, practical, use, of, units, of, measurement, have, played, a, crucial, role, in, human, endeavour, from, early, ages, up, to, the, present, a, multitude, of, systems, of, units, used, to, be, very, common, now, there, is, a, global, standard, the, international, system, of, units, si, the, modern, form, of, the, metric, system, in, trade, weights, and, measures, are, often, a, subject, of, governmental, regulation, to, ensure, fairness, and, transparency, the, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, bipm, is, tasked, with, ensuring, worldwide, uniformity, of, measurements, and, their, traceability, to, the, international, system, of, units, si, metrology, is, the, science, of, developing, nationally, and, internationally, accepted, units, of, measurement, in, physics, and, metrology, units, are, standards, for, measurement, of, physical, quantities, that, need, clear, definitions, to, be, useful, reproducibility, of, experimental, results, is, central, to, the, scientific, method, a, standard, system, of, units, facilitates, this, scientific, systems, of, units, are, a, refinement, of, the, concept, of, weights, and, measures, historically, developed, for, commercial, purposes, science, medicine, and, engineering, often, use, larger, and, smaller, units, of, measurement, than, those, used, in, everyday, life, the, judicious, selection, of, the, units, of, measurement, can, aid, researchers, in, problem, solving, see, for, example, dimensional, analysis, in, the, social, sciences, there, are, no, standard, units, of, measurement, a, unit, of, measurement, is, a, standardized, quantity, of, a, physical, property, used, as, a, factor, to, express, occurring, quantities, of, that, property, units, of, measurement, were, among, the, earliest, tools, invented, by, humans, primitive, societies, needed, rudimentary, measures, for, many, tasks, constructing, dwellings, of, an, appropriate, size, and, shape, fashioning, clothing, or, bartering, food, or, raw, materials, the, earliest, known, uniform, systems, of, measurement, seem, to, have, all, been, created, sometime, in, the, 4th, and, 3rd, millennia, bc, among, the, ancient, peoples, of, mesopotamia, egypt, and, the, indus, valley, and, perhaps, also, elam, in, persia, as, well, weights, and, measures, are, mentioned, in, the, bible, leviticus, 19, 35, 36, it, is, a, commandment, to, be, honest, and, have, fair, measures, in, the, magna, carta, of, 1215, the, great, charter, with, the, seal, of, king, john, put, before, him, by, the, barons, of, england, king, john, agreed, in, clause, 35, there, shall, be, one, measure, of, wine, throughout, our, whole, realm, and, one, measure, of, ale, and, one, measure, of, corn, namely, the, london, quart, and, one, width, of, dyed, and, russet, and, hauberk, cloths, namely, two, ells, below, the, selvage, as, of, the, 21st, century, the, international, system, is, predominantly, used, in, the, world, there, exist, other, unit, systems, which, are, used, in, many, places, such, as, the, united, states, customary, system, and, the, imperial, system, the, united, states, is, the, only, industrialized, country, that, has, not, yet, at, least, mostly, converted, to, the, metric, system, the, systematic, effort, to, develop, a, universally, acceptable, system, of, units, dates, back, to, 1790, when, the, french, national, assembly, charged, the, french, academy, of, sciences, to, come, up, such, a, unit, system, this, system, was, the, precursor, to, the, metric, system, which, was, quickly, developed, in, france, but, did, not, take, on, universal, acceptance, until, 1875, when, the, metric, convention, treaty, was, signed, by, 17, nations, after, this, treaty, was, signed, a, general, conference, of, weights, and, measures, cgpm, was, established, the, cgpm, produced, the, current, si, which, was, adopted, in, 1954, at, the, 10th, conference, of, weights, and, measures, currently, the, united, states, is, a, dual, system, society, which, uses, both, the, si, and, the, us, customary, system, the, use, of, a, single, unit, of, measurement, for, some, quantity, has, obvious, drawbacks, for, example, it, is, impractical, to, use, the, same, unit, for, the, distance, between, two, cities, and, the, length, of, a, needle, thus, historically, they, would, develop, independently, one, way, to, make, large, numbers, or, small, fractions, easier, to, read, is, to, use, unit, prefixes, at, some, point, in, time, though, the, need, to, relate, the, two, units, might, arise, and, consequently, the, need, to, choose, one, unit, as, defining, the, other, or, vice, versa, for, example, an, inch, could, be, defined, in, terms, of, a, barleycorn, a, system, of, measurement, is, a, collection, of, units, of, measurement, and, rules, relating, them, to, each, other, as, science, progressed, a, need, arose, to, relate, the, measurement, systems, of, different, quantities, like, length, and, weight, and, volume, the, effort, of, attempting, to, relate, different, traditional, systems, between, each, other, exposed, many, inconsistencies, and, brought, about, the, development, of, new, units, and, systems, systems, of, units, vary, from, country, to, country, some, of, the, different, systems, include, the, centimetre, gram, second, foot, pound, second, metre, kilogram, second, systems, and, the, international, system, of, units, si, among, the, different, systems, of, units, used, in, the, world, the, most, widely, used, and, internationally, accepted, one, is, si, the, base, si, units, are, the, second, metre, kilogram, ampere, kelvin, mole, and, candela, all, other, si, units, are, derived, from, these, base, units, 132, systems, of, measurement, in, modern, use, include, the, metric, system, the, imperial, system, and, united, states, customary, units, historically, many, of, the, systems, of, measurement, which, had, been, in, use, were, to, some, extent, based, on, the, dimensions, of, the, human, body, such, units, which, may, be, called, anthropic, units, include, the, cubit, based, on, the, length, of, the, forearm, the, pace, based, on, the, length, of, a, stride, and, the, foot, and, hand, 25, as, a, result, units, of, measure, could, vary, not, only, from, location, to, location, but, from, person, to, person, units, not, based, on, the, human, body, could, be, based, on, agriculture, as, is, the, case, with, the, furlong, and, the, acre, both, based, on, the, amount, of, land, able, to, be, worked, by, a, team, of, oxen, metric, systems, of, units, have, evolved, since, the, adoption, of, the, original, metric, system, in, france, in, 1791, the, current, international, standard, metric, system, is, the, international, system, of, units, abbreviated, to, si, an, important, feature, of, modern, systems, is, standardization, each, unit, has, a, universally, recognized, size, both, the, imperial, units, and, us, customary, units, derive, from, earlier, english, units, imperial, units, were, mostly, used, in, the, british, commonwealth, and, the, former, british, empire, us, customary, units, are, still, the, main, system, of, measurement, used, in, the, united, states, outside, of, science, medicine, many, sectors, of, industry, and, some, of, government, and, military, and, despite, congress, having, legally, authorised, metric, measure, on, 28, july, 1866, some, steps, towards, us, metrication, have, been, made, particularly, the, redefinition, of, basic, us, and, imperial, units, to, derive, exactly, from, si, units, since, the, international, yard, and, pound, agreement, of, 1959, the, us, and, imperial, inch, is, now, defined, as, exactly, 0, 0254, m, and, the, us, and, imperial, avoirdupois, pound, is, now, defined, as, exactly, 0, 453, 592, 37, kg, while, the, above, systems, of, units, are, based, on, arbitrary, unit, values, formalised, as, standards, natural, units, in, physics, are, based, on, physical, principle, or, are, selected, to, make, physical, equations, easier, to, work, with, for, example, atomic, units, au, were, designed, to, simplify, the, wave, equation, in, atomic, physics, some, unusual, and, non, standard, units, may, be, encountered, in, sciences, these, may, include, the, solar, mass, 2, 10, 30, kg, the, megaton, the, energy, released, by, detonating, one, million, tons, of, trinitrotoluene, tnt, and, the, electronvolt, to, reduce, the, incidence, of, retail, fraud, many, national, statutes, have, standard, definitions, of, weights, and, measures, that, may, be, used, hence, statute, measure, and, these, are, verified, by, legal, officers, in, informal, settings, a, quantity, may, be, described, as, multiples, of, that, of, a, familiar, entity, which, can, be, easier, to, contextualize, than, a, value, in, a, formal, unit, system, for, instance, a, publication, may, describe, an, area, in, a, foreign, country, as, a, number, of, multiples, of, the, area, of, a, region, local, to, the, readership, the, propensity, for, certain, concepts, to, be, used, frequently, can, give, rise, to, loosely, defined, systems, of, units, for, most, quantities, a, unit, is, necessary, to, communicate, values, of, that, physical, quantity, for, example, conveying, to, someone, a, particular, length, without, using, some, sort, of, unit, is, impossible, because, a, length, cannot, be, described, without, a, reference, used, to, make, sense, of, the, value, given, but, not, all, quantities, require, a, unit, of, their, own, using, physical, laws, units, of, quantities, can, be, expressed, as, combinations, of, units, of, other, quantities, thus, only, a, small, set, of, units, is, required, these, units, are, taken, as, the, base, units, and, the, other, units, are, derived, units, thus, base, units, are, the, units, of, the, quantities, which, are, independent, of, other, quantities, and, they, are, the, units, of, length, mass, time, electric, current, temperature, luminous, intensity, and, the, amount, of, substance, derived, units, are, the, units, of, the, quantities, which, are, derived, from, the, base, quantities, and, some, of, the, derived, units, are, the, units, of, speed, work, acceleration, energy, pressure, etc, different, systems, of, units, are, based, on, different, choices, of, a, set, of, related, units, including, fundamental, and, derived, units, following, iso, 80000, 1, any, value, or, magnitude, of, a, physical, quantity, is, expressed, as, a, comparison, to, a, unit, of, that, quantity, the, value, of, a, physical, quantity, z, is, expressed, as, the, product, of, a, numerical, value, z, a, pure, number, and, a, unit, for, example, let, z, displaystyle, z, be, 2, metres, then, z, 2, displaystyle, z, 2, is, the, numerical, value, and, z, m, e, t, r, e, displaystyle, mathrm, metre, is, the, unit, conversely, the, numerical, value, expressed, in, an, arbitrary, unit, can, be, obtained, as, units, can, only, be, added, or, subtracted, if, they, are, the, same, type, however, units, can, always, be, multiplied, or, divided, as, george, gamow, used, to, explain, let, z, displaystyle, z, be, 2, metres, and, w, displaystyle, w, 3, seconds, then, there, are, certain, rules, that, apply, to, units, conversion, of, units, is, the, conversion, of, the, unit, of, measurement, in, which, a, quantity, is, expressed, typically, through, a, multiplicative, conversion, factor, that, changes, the, unit, without, changing, the, quantity, this, is, also, often, loosely, taken, to, include, replacement, of, a, quantity, with, a, corresponding, quantity, that, describes, the, same, physical, property, one, example, of, the, importance, of, agreed, units, is, the, failure, of, the, nasa, mars, climate, orbiter, which, was, accidentally, destroyed, on, a, mission, to, mars, in, september, 1999, instead, of, entering, orbit, due, to, miscommunications, about, the, value, of, forces, different, computer, programs, used, different, units, of, measurement, newton, versus, pound, force, considerable, amounts, of, effort, time, and, money, were, wasted, on, 15, april, 1999, korean, air, cargo, flight, 6316, from, shanghai, to, seoul, was, lost, due, to, the, crew, confusing, tower, instructions, in, metres, and, altimeter, readings, in, feet, three, crew, and, five, people, on, the, ground, were, killed, thirty, seven, were, injured, in, 1983, a, boeing, 767, which, thanks, to, its, pilot, s, gliding, skills, landed, safely, and, became, known, as, the, gimli, glider, ran, out, of, fuel, in, mid, flight, because, of, two, mistakes, in, figuring, the, fuel, supply, of, air, canada, s, first, aircraft, to, use, metric, measurements, this, accident, was, the, result, of, both, confusion, due, to, the, simultaneous, use, of, metric, and, imperial, measures, and, confusion, of, mass, and, volume, measures, when, planning, his, journey, across, the, atlantic, ocean, in, the, 1480s, columbus, mistakenly, assumed, that, the, mile, referred, to, in, the, arabic, estimate, of, 56, 2, 3, miles, for, the, size, of, a, degree, was, the, same, as, the, actually, much, shorter, italian, mile, of, 1, 480, metres, his, estimate, for, the, size, of, the, degree, and, for, the, circumference, of, the, earth, was, therefore, about, 25, too, small, 1, 17, historical, legal, metric, information
