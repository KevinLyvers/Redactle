a, muon, m, j, u, n, m, y, oo, on, from, the, greek, letter, mu, used, to, represent, it, is, an, elementary, particle, similar, to, the, electron, with, an, electric, charge, of, 1, e, and, spin, 1, 2, but, with, a, much, greater, mass, it, is, classified, as, a, lepton, as, with, other, leptons, the, muon, is, not, thought, to, be, composed, of, any, simpler, particles, the, muon, is, an, unstable, subatomic, particle, with, a, mean, lifetime, of, 2, 2, s, much, longer, than, many, other, subatomic, particles, as, with, the, decay, of, the, free, neutron, with, a, lifetime, around, 15, minutes, muon, decay, is, slow, by, subatomic, standards, because, the, decay, is, mediated, only, by, the, weak, interaction, rather, than, the, more, powerful, strong, interaction, or, electromagnetic, interaction, and, because, the, mass, difference, between, the, muon, and, the, set, of, its, decay, products, is, small, providing, few, kinetic, degrees, of, freedom, for, decay, muon, decay, almost, always, produces, at, least, three, particles, which, must, include, an, electron, of, the, same, charge, as, the, muon, and, two, types, of, neutrinos, like, all, elementary, particles, the, muon, has, a, corresponding, antiparticle, of, opposite, charge, 1, e, but, equal, mass, and, spin, the, antimuon, also, called, a, positive, muon, muons, are, denoted, by, and, antimuons, by, formerly, muons, were, called, mu, mesons, but, are, not, classified, as, mesons, by, modern, particle, physicists, see, history, and, that, name, is, no, longer, used, by, the, physics, community, muons, have, a, mass, of, 105, 66, mev, c, 2, which, is, approximately, 206, 768, 2827, 46, times, that, of, the, electron, m, e, there, is, also, a, third, lepton, the, tau, approximately, 17, times, heavier, than, the, muon, due, to, their, greater, mass, muons, accelerate, slower, than, electrons, in, electromagnetic, fields, and, emit, less, bremsstrahlung, deceleration, radiation, this, allows, muons, of, a, given, energy, to, penetrate, far, deeper, into, matter, because, the, deceleration, of, electrons, and, muons, is, primarily, due, to, energy, loss, by, the, bremsstrahlung, mechanism, for, example, so, called, secondary, muons, created, by, cosmic, rays, hitting, the, atmosphere, can, penetrate, the, atmosphere, and, reach, earth, s, land, surface, and, even, into, deep, mines, because, muons, have, a, greater, mass, and, energy, than, the, decay, energy, of, radioactivity, they, are, not, produced, by, radioactive, decay, nonetheless, they, are, produced, in, great, amounts, in, high, energy, interactions, in, normal, matter, in, certain, particle, accelerator, experiments, with, hadrons, and, in, cosmic, ray, interactions, with, matter, these, interactions, usually, produce, pi, mesons, initially, which, almost, always, decay, to, muons, as, with, the, other, charged, leptons, the, muon, has, an, associated, muon, neutrino, denoted, by, which, differs, from, the, electron, neutrino, and, participates, in, different, nuclear, reactions, muons, were, discovered, by, carl, d, anderson, and, seth, neddermeyer, at, caltech, in, 1936, while, studying, cosmic, radiation, anderson, noticed, particles, that, curved, differently, from, electrons, and, other, known, particles, when, passed, through, a, magnetic, field, they, were, negatively, charged, but, curved, less, sharply, than, electrons, but, more, sharply, than, protons, for, particles, of, the, same, velocity, it, was, assumed, that, the, magnitude, of, their, negative, electric, charge, was, equal, to, that, of, the, electron, and, so, to, account, for, the, difference, in, curvature, it, was, supposed, that, their, mass, was, greater, than, an, electron, s, but, smaller, than, a, proton, s, thus, anderson, initially, called, the, new, particle, a, mesotron, adopting, the, prefix, meso, from, the, greek, word, for, mid, the, existence, of, the, muon, was, confirmed, in, 1937, by, j, c, street, and, e, c, stevenson, s, cloud, chamber, experiment, a, particle, with, a, mass, in, the, meson, range, had, been, predicted, before, the, discovery, of, any, mesons, by, theorist, hideki, yukawa, it, seems, natural, to, modify, the, theory, of, heisenberg, and, fermi, in, the, following, way, the, transition, of, a, heavy, particle, from, neutron, state, to, proton, state, is, not, always, accompanied, by, the, emission, of, light, particles, the, transition, is, sometimes, taken, up, by, another, heavy, particle, because, of, its, mass, the, mu, meson, was, initially, thought, to, be, yukawa, s, particle, and, some, scientists, including, niels, bohr, originally, named, it, the, yukon, the, fact, that, the, mesotron, i, e, the, muon, was, not, yukawa, s, particle, was, established, in, 1946, by, an, experiment, conducted, by, marcello, conversi, oreste, piccioni, and, ettore, pancini, in, rome, in, this, experiment, which, luis, walter, alvarez, called, the, start, of, modern, particle, physics, in, his, 1968, nobel, lecture, they, showed, that, the, muons, from, cosmic, rays, were, decaying, without, being, captured, by, atomic, nuclei, contrary, to, what, expected, by, the, mediator, of, the, nuclear, force, postulated, by, yukawa, yukawa, s, predicted, particle, the, pi, meson, was, finally, identified, in, 1947, again, from, cosmic, ray, interactions, with, two, particles, now, known, with, the, intermediate, mass, the, more, general, term, meson, was, adopted, to, refer, to, any, such, particle, within, the, correct, mass, range, between, electrons, and, nucleons, further, in, order, to, differentiate, between, the, two, different, types, of, mesons, after, the, second, meson, was, discovered, the, initial, mesotron, particle, was, renamed, the, mu, meson, the, greek, letter, corresponds, to, m, and, the, new, 1947, meson, yukawa, s, particle, was, named, the, pi, meson, as, more, types, of, mesons, were, discovered, in, accelerator, experiments, later, it, was, eventually, found, that, the, mu, meson, significantly, differed, not, only, from, the, pi, meson, of, about, the, same, mass, but, also, from, all, other, types, of, mesons, the, difference, in, part, was, that, mu, mesons, did, not, interact, with, the, nuclear, force, as, pi, mesons, did, and, were, required, to, do, in, yukawa, s, theory, newer, mesons, also, showed, evidence, of, behaving, like, the, pi, meson, in, nuclear, interactions, but, not, like, the, mu, meson, also, the, mu, meson, s, decay, products, included, both, a, neutrino, and, an, antineutrino, rather, than, just, one, or, the, other, as, was, observed, in, the, decay, of, other, charged, mesons, in, the, eventual, standard, model, of, particle, physics, codified, in, the, 1970s, all, mesons, other, than, the, mu, meson, were, understood, to, be, hadrons, that, is, particles, made, of, quarks, and, thus, subject, to, the, nuclear, force, in, the, quark, model, a, meson, was, no, longer, defined, by, mass, for, some, had, been, discovered, that, were, very, massive, more, than, nucleons, but, instead, were, particles, composed, of, exactly, two, quarks, a, quark, and, antiquark, unlike, the, baryons, which, are, defined, as, particles, composed, of, three, quarks, protons, and, neutrons, were, the, lightest, baryons, mu, mesons, however, had, shown, themselves, to, be, fundamental, particles, leptons, like, electrons, with, no, quark, structure, thus, mu, mesons, were, not, mesons, at, all, in, the, new, sense, and, use, of, the, term, meson, used, with, the, quark, model, of, particle, structure, with, this, change, in, definition, the, term, mu, meson, was, abandoned, and, replaced, whenever, possible, with, the, modern, term, muon, making, the, term, mu, meson, only, a, historical, footnote, in, the, new, quark, model, other, types, of, mesons, sometimes, continued, to, be, referred, to, in, shorter, terminology, e, g, pion, for, pi, meson, but, in, the, case, of, the, muon, it, retained, the, shorter, name, and, was, never, again, properly, referred, to, by, older, mu, meson, terminology, the, eventual, recognition, of, the, muon, as, a, simple, heavy, electron, with, no, role, at, all, in, the, nuclear, interaction, seemed, so, incongruous, and, surprising, at, the, time, that, nobel, laureate, i, i, rabi, famously, quipped, who, ordered, that, in, the, rossi, hall, experiment, 1941, muons, were, used, to, observe, the, time, dilation, or, alternatively, length, contraction, predicted, by, special, relativity, for, the, first, time, muons, arriving, on, the, earth, s, surface, are, created, indirectly, as, decay, products, of, collisions, of, cosmic, rays, with, particles, of, the, earth, s, atmosphere, about, 10, 000, muons, reach, every, square, meter, of, the, earth, s, surface, a, minute, these, charged, particles, form, as, by, products, of, cosmic, rays, colliding, with, molecules, in, the, upper, atmosphere, traveling, at, relativistic, speeds, muons, can, penetrate, tens, of, meters, into, rocks, and, other, matter, before, attenuating, as, a, result, of, absorption, or, deflection, by, other, atoms, when, a, cosmic, ray, proton, impacts, atomic, nuclei, in, the, upper, atmosphere, pions, are, created, these, decay, within, a, relatively, short, distance, meters, into, muons, their, preferred, decay, product, and, muon, neutrinos, the, muons, from, these, high, energy, cosmic, rays, generally, continue, in, about, the, same, direction, as, the, original, proton, at, a, velocity, near, the, speed, of, light, although, their, lifetime, without, relativistic, effects, would, allow, a, half, survival, distance, of, only, about, 456, meters, 2, 197, s, ln, 2, 0, 9997, c, at, most, as, seen, from, earth, the, time, dilation, effect, of, special, relativity, from, the, viewpoint, of, the, earth, allows, cosmic, ray, secondary, muons, to, survive, the, flight, to, the, earth, s, surface, since, in, the, earth, frame, the, muons, have, a, longer, half, life, due, to, their, velocity, from, the, viewpoint, inertial, frame, of, the, muon, on, the, other, hand, it, is, the, length, contraction, effect, of, special, relativity, that, allows, this, penetration, since, in, the, muon, frame, its, lifetime, is, unaffected, but, the, length, contraction, causes, distances, through, the, atmosphere, and, earth, to, be, far, shorter, than, these, distances, in, the, earth, rest, frame, both, effects, are, equally, valid, ways, of, explaining, the, fast, muon, s, unusual, survival, over, distances, since, muons, are, unusually, penetrative, of, ordinary, matter, like, neutrinos, they, are, also, detectable, deep, underground, 700, meters, at, the, soudan, 2, detector, and, underwater, where, they, form, a, major, part, of, the, natural, background, ionizing, radiation, like, cosmic, rays, as, noted, this, secondary, muon, radiation, is, also, directional, the, same, nuclear, reaction, described, above, i, e, hadron, hadron, impacts, to, produce, pion, beams, which, then, quickly, decay, to, muon, beams, over, short, distances, is, used, by, particle, physicists, to, produce, muon, beams, such, as, the, beam, used, for, the, muon, g, 2, experiment, muons, are, unstable, elementary, particles, and, are, heavier, than, electrons, and, neutrinos, but, lighter, than, all, other, matter, particles, they, decay, via, the, weak, interaction, because, leptonic, family, numbers, are, conserved, in, the, absence, of, an, extremely, unlikely, immediate, neutrino, oscillation, one, of, the, product, neutrinos, of, muon, decay, must, be, a, muon, type, neutrino, and, the, other, an, electron, type, antineutrino, antimuon, decay, produces, the, corresponding, antiparticles, as, detailed, below, because, charge, must, be, conserved, one, of, the, products, of, muon, decay, is, always, an, electron, of, the, same, charge, as, the, muon, a, positron, if, it, is, a, positive, muon, thus, all, muons, decay, to, at, least, an, electron, and, two, neutrinos, sometimes, besides, these, necessary, products, additional, other, particles, that, have, no, net, charge, and, spin, of, zero, e, g, a, pair, of, photons, or, an, electron, positron, pair, are, produced, the, dominant, muon, decay, mode, sometimes, called, the, michel, decay, after, louis, michel, is, the, simplest, possible, the, muon, decays, to, an, electron, an, electron, antineutrino, and, a, muon, neutrino, antimuons, in, mirror, fashion, most, often, decay, to, the, corresponding, antiparticles, a, positron, an, electron, neutrino, and, a, muon, antineutrino, in, formulaic, terms, these, two, decays, are, the, mean, lifetime, of, the, positive, muon, is, 2, 196, 9811, 0, 000, 0022, s, the, equality, of, the, muon, and, antimuon, lifetimes, has, been, established, to, better, than, one, part, in, 10, 4, certain, neutrino, less, decay, modes, are, kinematically, allowed, but, are, for, all, practical, purposes, forbidden, in, the, standard, model, even, given, that, neutrinos, have, mass, and, oscillate, examples, forbidden, by, lepton, flavour, conservation, are, and, taking, into, account, neutrino, mass, a, decay, like, e, is, technically, possible, in, the, standard, model, for, example, by, neutrino, oscillation, of, a, virtual, muon, neutrino, into, an, electron, neutrino, but, such, a, decay, is, hugely, unlikely, and, therefore, should, be, experimentally, unobservable, fewer, than, one, in, 10, 50, muon, decays, should, produce, such, a, decay, observation, of, such, decay, modes, would, constitute, clear, evidence, for, theories, beyond, the, standard, model, upper, limits, for, the, branching, fractions, of, such, decay, modes, were, measured, in, many, experiments, starting, more, than, 60, years, ago, the, current, upper, limit, for, the, e, branching, fraction, was, measured, 2009, 2013, in, the, meg, experiment, and, is, 4, 2, 10, 13, the, muon, decay, width, that, follows, from, fermi, s, golden, rule, has, dimension, of, energy, and, must, be, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, amplitude, and, thus, the, square, of, fermi, s, coupling, constant, g, f, displaystyle, g, text, f, with, over, all, dimension, of, inverse, fourth, power, of, energy, by, dimensional, analysis, this, leads, to, sargent, s, rule, of, fifth, power, dependence, on, m, where, i, x, 1, 8, x, 12, x, 2, ln, x, 8, x, 3, x, 4, displaystyle, i, x, 1, 8x, 12x, 2, ln, x, 8x, 3, x, 4, and, the, decay, distributions, of, the, electron, in, muon, decays, have, been, parameterised, using, the, so, called, michel, parameters, the, values, of, these, four, parameters, are, predicted, unambiguously, in, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, thus, muon, decays, represent, a, good, test, of, the, spacetime, structure, of, the, weak, interaction, no, deviation, from, the, standard, model, predictions, has, yet, been, found, for, the, decay, of, the, muon, the, expected, decay, distribution, for, the, standard, model, values, of, michel, parameters, is, where, displaystyle, theta, is, the, angle, between, the, muon, s, polarization, vector, p, displaystyle, mathbf, p, mu, and, the, decay, electron, momentum, vector, and, p, p, displaystyle, p, mu, mathbf, p, mu, is, the, fraction, of, muons, that, are, forward, polarized, integrating, this, expression, over, electron, energy, gives, the, angular, distribution, of, the, daughter, electrons, the, electron, energy, distribution, integrated, over, the, polar, angle, valid, for, x, 1, displaystyle, x, 1, is, because, the, direction, the, electron, is, emitted, in, a, polar, vector, is, preferentially, aligned, opposite, the, muon, spin, an, axial, vector, the, decay, is, an, example, of, non, conservation, of, parity, by, the, weak, interaction, this, is, essentially, the, same, experimental, signature, as, used, by, the, original, demonstration, more, generally, in, the, standard, model, all, charged, leptons, decay, via, the, weak, interaction, and, likewise, violate, parity, symmetry, the, muon, was, the, first, elementary, particle, discovered, that, does, not, appear, in, ordinary, atoms, negative, muons, can, form, muonic, atoms, previously, called, mu, mesic, atoms, by, replacing, an, electron, in, ordinary, atoms, muonic, hydrogen, atoms, are, much, smaller, than, typical, hydrogen, atoms, because, the, much, larger, mass, of, the, muon, gives, it, a, much, more, localized, ground, state, wavefunction, than, is, observed, for, the, electron, in, multi, electron, atoms, when, only, one, of, the, electrons, is, replaced, by, a, muon, the, size, of, the, atom, continues, to, be, determined, by, the, other, electrons, and, the, atomic, size, is, nearly, unchanged, nonetheless, in, such, cases, the, orbital, of, the, muon, continues, to, be, smaller, and, far, closer, to, the, nucleus, than, the, atomic, orbitals, of, the, electrons, spectroscopic, measurements, in, muonic, hydrogen, have, been, used, to, produce, a, precise, estimate, of, the, proton, radius, the, results, of, these, measurements, diverged, from, the, then, accepted, value, giving, rise, to, the, so, called, proton, radius, puzzle, later, this, puzzle, found, its, resolution, when, new, improved, measurements, of, the, proton, radius, in, the, electronic, hydrogen, became, available, muonic, helium, is, created, by, substituting, a, muon, for, one, of, the, electrons, in, helium, 4, the, muon, orbits, much, closer, to, the, nucleus, so, muonic, helium, can, therefore, be, regarded, like, an, isotope, of, helium, whose, nucleus, consists, of, two, neutrons, two, protons, and, a, muon, with, a, single, electron, outside, chemically, muonic, helium, possessing, an, unpaired, valence, electron, can, bond, with, other, atoms, and, behaves, more, like, a, hydrogen, atom, than, an, inert, helium, atom, muonic, heavy, hydrogen, atoms, with, a, negative, muon, may, undergo, nuclear, fusion, in, the, process, of, muon, catalyzed, fusion, after, the, muon, may, leave, the, new, atom, to, induce, fusion, in, another, hydrogen, molecule, this, process, continues, until, the, negative, muon, is, captured, by, a, helium, nucleus, where, it, remains, until, it, decays, negative, muons, bound, to, conventional, atoms, can, be, captured, muon, capture, through, the, weak, force, by, protons, in, nuclei, in, a, sort, of, electron, capture, like, process, when, this, happens, nuclear, transmutation, results, the, proton, becomes, a, neutron, and, a, muon, neutrino, is, emitted, a, positive, muon, when, stopped, in, ordinary, matter, cannot, be, captured, by, a, proton, since, the, two, positive, charges, can, only, repel, the, positive, muon, is, also, not, attracted, to, the, nucleus, of, atoms, instead, it, binds, a, random, electron, and, with, this, electron, forms, an, exotic, atom, known, as, muonium, mu, atom, in, this, atom, the, muon, acts, as, the, nucleus, the, positive, muon, in, this, context, can, be, considered, a, pseudo, isotope, of, hydrogen, with, one, ninth, of, the, mass, of, the, proton, because, the, mass, of, the, electron, is, much, smaller, than, the, mass, of, both, the, proton, and, the, muon, the, reduced, mass, of, muonium, and, hence, its, bohr, radius, is, very, close, to, that, of, hydrogen, therefore, this, bound, muon, electron, pair, can, be, treated, to, a, first, approximation, as, a, short, lived, atom, that, behaves, chemically, like, the, isotopes, of, hydrogen, protium, deuterium, and, tritium, both, positive, and, negative, muons, can, be, part, of, a, short, lived, pi, mu, atom, consisting, of, a, muon, and, an, oppositely, charged, pion, these, atoms, were, observed, in, the, 1970s, in, experiments, at, brookhaven, national, laboratory, and, fermilab, the, anomalous, magnetic, dipole, moment, is, the, difference, between, the, experimentally, observed, value, of, the, magnetic, dipole, moment, and, the, theoretical, value, predicted, by, the, dirac, equation, the, measurement, and, prediction, of, this, value, is, very, important, in, the, precision, tests, of, qed, the, e821, experiment, at, brookhaven, and, the, muon, g, 2, experiment, at, fermilab, studied, the, precession, of, the, muon, spin, in, a, constant, external, magnetic, field, as, the, muons, circulated, in, a, confining, storage, ring, the, muon, g, 2, collaboration, reported, in, 2021, the, prediction, for, the, value, of, the, muon, anomalous, magnetic, moment, includes, three, parts, the, difference, between, the, g, factors, of, the, muon, and, the, electron, is, due, to, their, difference, in, mass, because, of, the, muon, s, larger, mass, contributions, to, the, theoretical, calculation, of, its, anomalous, magnetic, dipole, moment, from, standard, model, weak, interactions, and, from, contributions, involving, hadrons, are, important, at, the, current, level, of, precision, whereas, these, effects, are, not, important, for, the, electron, the, muon, s, anomalous, magnetic, dipole, moment, is, also, sensitive, to, contributions, from, new, physics, beyond, the, standard, model, such, as, supersymmetry, for, this, reason, the, muon, s, anomalous, magnetic, moment, is, normally, used, as, a, probe, for, new, physics, beyond, the, standard, model, rather, than, as, a, test, of, qed, muon, g, 2, a, new, experiment, at, fermilab, using, the, e821, magnet, improved, the, precision, of, this, measurement, in, 2020, an, international, team, of, 170, physicists, calculated, the, most, accurate, prediction, for, the, theoretical, value, of, the, muon, s, anomalous, magnetic, moment, muon, g, 2, is, a, particle, physics, experiment, at, fermilab, to, measure, the, anomalous, magnetic, dipole, moment, of, a, muon, to, a, precision, of, 0, 14, ppm, which, is, a, sensitive, test, of, the, standard, model, it, might, also, provide, evidence, of, the, existence, of, entirely, new, particles, in, 2021, the, muon, g, 2, experiment, presented, their, first, results, of, a, new, experimental, average, that, increased, the, difference, between, experiment, and, theory, to, 4, 2, standard, deviations, the, current, experimental, limit, on, the, muon, electric, dipole, moment, d, 1, 9, 10, 19, e, cm, set, by, the, e821, experiment, at, the, brookhaven, is, orders, of, magnitude, above, the, standard, model, prediction, the, observation, of, a, non, zero, muon, electric, dipole, moment, would, provide, an, additional, source, of, cp, violation, an, improvement, in, sensitivity, by, two, orders, of, magnitude, over, the, brookhaven, limit, is, expected, from, the, experiments, at, fermilab, since, muons, are, much, more, deeply, penetrating, than, x, rays, or, gamma, rays, muon, imaging, can, be, used, with, much, thicker, material, or, with, cosmic, ray, sources, larger, objects, one, example, is, commercial, muon, tomography, used, to, image, entire, cargo, containers, to, detect, shielded, nuclear, material, as, well, as, explosives, or, other, contraband, the, technique, of, muon, transmission, radiography, based, on, cosmic, ray, sources, was, first, used, in, the, 1950s, to, measure, the, depth, of, the, overburden, of, a, tunnel, in, australia, and, in, the, 1960s, to, search, for, possible, hidden, chambers, in, the, pyramid, of, chephren, in, giza, in, 2017, the, discovery, of, a, large, void, with, a, length, of, 30, metres, minimum, by, observation, of, cosmic, ray, muons, was, reported, in, 2003, the, scientists, at, los, alamos, national, laboratory, developed, a, new, imaging, technique, muon, scattering, tomography, with, muon, scattering, tomography, both, incoming, and, outgoing, trajectories, for, each, particle, are, reconstructed, such, as, with, sealed, aluminum, drift, tubes, since, the, development, of, this, technique, several, companies, have, started, to, use, it, in, august, 2014, decision, sciences, international, corporation, announced, it, had, been, awarded, a, contract, by, toshiba, for, use, of, its, muon, tracking, detectors, in, reclaiming, the, fukushima, nuclear, complex, the, fukushima, daiichi, tracker, was, proposed, to, make, a, few, months, of, muon, measurements, to, show, the, distribution, of, the, reactor, cores, in, december, 2014, tepco, reported, that, they, would, be, using, two, different, muon, imaging, techniques, at, fukushima, muon, scanning, method, on, unit, 1, the, most, badly, damaged, where, the, fuel, may, have, left, the, reactor, vessel, and, muon, scattering, method, on, unit, 2, the, international, research, institute, for, nuclear, decommissioning, irid, in, japan, and, the, high, energy, accelerator, research, organization, kek, call, the, method, they, developed, for, unit, 1, the, muon, permeation, method, 1, 200, optical, fibers, for, wavelength, conversion, light, up, when, muons, come, into, contact, with, them, after, a, month, of, data, collection, it, is, hoped, to, reveal, the, location, and, amount, of, fuel, debris, still, inside, the, reactor, the, measurements, began, in, february, 2015
