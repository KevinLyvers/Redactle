the, ecliptic, or, ecliptic, plane, is, the, orbital, plane, of, earth, around, the, sun, from, the, perspective, of, an, observer, on, earth, the, sun, s, movement, around, the, celestial, sphere, over, the, course, of, a, year, traces, out, a, path, along, the, ecliptic, against, the, background, of, stars, the, ecliptic, is, an, important, reference, plane, and, is, the, basis, of, the, ecliptic, coordinate, system, the, ecliptic, is, the, apparent, path, of, the, sun, throughout, the, course, of, a, year, because, earth, takes, one, year, to, orbit, the, sun, the, apparent, position, of, the, sun, takes, one, year, to, make, a, complete, circuit, of, the, ecliptic, with, slightly, more, than, 365, days, in, one, year, the, sun, moves, a, little, less, than, 1, eastward, every, day, this, small, difference, in, the, sun, s, position, against, the, stars, causes, any, particular, spot, on, earth, s, surface, to, catch, up, with, and, stand, directly, north, or, south, of, the, sun, about, four, minutes, later, each, day, than, it, would, if, earth, did, not, orbit, a, day, on, earth, is, therefore, 24, hours, long, rather, than, the, approximately, 23, hour, 56, minute, sidereal, day, again, this, is, a, simplification, based, on, a, hypothetical, earth, that, orbits, at, uniform, speed, around, the, sun, the, actual, speed, with, which, earth, orbits, the, sun, varies, slightly, during, the, year, so, the, speed, with, which, the, sun, seems, to, move, along, the, ecliptic, also, varies, for, example, the, sun, is, north, of, the, celestial, equator, for, about, 185, days, of, each, year, and, south, of, it, for, about, 180, days, the, variation, of, orbital, speed, accounts, for, part, of, the, equation, of, time, because, of, the, movement, of, earth, around, the, earth, moon, center, of, mass, the, apparent, path, of, the, sun, wobbles, slightly, with, a, period, of, about, one, month, because, of, further, perturbations, by, the, other, planets, of, the, solar, system, the, earth, moon, barycenter, wobbles, slightly, around, a, mean, position, in, a, complex, fashion, because, earth, s, rotational, axis, is, not, perpendicular, to, its, orbital, plane, earth, s, equatorial, plane, is, not, coplanar, with, the, ecliptic, plane, but, is, inclined, to, it, by, an, angle, of, about, 23, 4, which, is, known, as, the, obliquity, of, the, ecliptic, if, the, equator, is, projected, outward, to, the, celestial, sphere, forming, the, celestial, equator, it, crosses, the, ecliptic, at, two, points, known, as, the, equinoxes, the, sun, in, its, apparent, motion, along, the, ecliptic, crosses, the, celestial, equator, at, these, points, one, from, south, to, north, the, other, from, north, to, south, the, crossing, from, south, to, north, is, known, as, the, march, equinox, also, known, as, the, first, point, of, aries, and, the, ascending, node, of, the, ecliptic, on, the, celestial, equator, the, crossing, from, north, to, south, is, the, september, equinox, or, descending, node, the, orientation, of, earth, s, axis, and, equator, are, not, fixed, in, space, but, rotate, about, the, poles, of, the, ecliptic, with, a, period, of, about, 26, 000, years, a, process, known, as, lunisolar, precession, as, it, is, due, mostly, to, the, gravitational, effect, of, the, moon, and, sun, on, earth, s, equatorial, bulge, likewise, the, ecliptic, itself, is, not, fixed, the, gravitational, perturbations, of, the, other, bodies, of, the, solar, system, cause, a, much, smaller, motion, of, the, plane, of, earth, s, orbit, and, hence, of, the, ecliptic, known, as, planetary, precession, the, combined, action, of, these, two, motions, is, called, general, precession, and, changes, the, position, of, the, equinoxes, by, about, 50, arc, seconds, about, 0, 014, per, year, once, again, this, is, a, simplification, periodic, motions, of, the, moon, and, apparent, periodic, motions, of, the, sun, actually, of, earth, in, its, orbit, cause, short, term, small, amplitude, periodic, oscillations, of, earth, s, axis, and, hence, the, celestial, equator, known, as, nutation, this, adds, a, periodic, component, to, the, position, of, the, equinoxes, the, positions, of, the, celestial, equator, and, march, equinox, with, fully, updated, precession, and, nutation, are, called, the, true, equator, and, equinox, the, positions, without, nutation, are, the, mean, equator, and, equinox, obliquity, of, the, ecliptic, is, the, term, used, by, astronomers, for, the, inclination, of, earth, s, equator, with, respect, to, the, ecliptic, or, of, earth, s, rotation, axis, to, a, perpendicular, to, the, ecliptic, it, is, about, 23, 4, and, is, currently, decreasing, 0, 013, degrees, 47, arcseconds, per, hundred, years, because, of, planetary, perturbations, the, angular, value, of, the, obliquity, is, found, by, observation, of, the, motions, of, earth, and, other, planets, over, many, years, astronomers, produce, new, fundamental, ephemerides, as, the, accuracy, of, observation, improves, and, as, the, understanding, of, the, dynamics, increases, and, from, these, ephemerides, various, astronomical, values, including, the, obliquity, are, derived, until, 1983, the, obliquity, for, any, date, was, calculated, from, work, of, newcomb, who, analyzed, positions, of, the, planets, until, about, 1895, 23, 27, 08, 26, 46, 845, t, 0, 0059, t, 2, 0, 00181, t, 3, where, is, the, obliquity, and, t, is, tropical, centuries, from, b1900, 0, to, the, date, in, question, from, 1984, the, jet, propulsion, laboratory, s, de, series, of, computer, generated, ephemerides, took, over, as, the, fundamental, ephemeris, of, the, astronomical, almanac, obliquity, based, on, de200, which, analyzed, observations, from, 1911, to, 1979, was, calculated, 23, 26, 21, 45, 46, 815, t, 0, 0006, t, 2, 0, 00181, t, 3, where, hereafter, t, is, julian, centuries, from, j2000, 0, jpl, s, fundamental, ephemerides, have, been, continually, updated, the, astronomical, almanac, for, 2010, specifies, 23, 26, 21, 406, 46, 836769, t, 0, 0001831, t, 2, 0, 00200340, t, 3, 0, 576, 10, 6, t, 4, 4, 34, 10, 8, t, 5, these, expressions, for, the, obliquity, are, intended, for, high, precision, over, a, relatively, short, time, span, perhaps, several, centuries, j, laskar, computed, an, expression, to, order, t, 10, good, to, 0, 04, 1000, years, over, 10, 000, years, all, of, these, expressions, are, for, the, mean, obliquity, that, is, without, the, nutation, of, the, equator, included, the, true, or, instantaneous, obliquity, includes, the, nutation, most, of, the, major, bodies, of, the, solar, system, orbit, the, sun, in, nearly, the, same, plane, this, is, likely, due, to, the, way, in, which, the, solar, system, formed, from, a, protoplanetary, disk, probably, the, closest, current, representation, of, the, disk, is, known, as, the, invariable, plane, of, the, solar, system, earth, s, orbit, and, hence, the, ecliptic, is, inclined, a, little, more, than, 1, to, the, invariable, plane, jupiter, s, orbit, is, within, a, little, more, than, of, it, and, the, other, major, planets, are, all, within, about, 6, because, of, this, most, solar, system, bodies, appear, very, close, to, the, ecliptic, in, the, sky, the, invariable, plane, is, defined, by, the, angular, momentum, of, the, entire, solar, system, essentially, the, vector, sum, of, all, of, the, orbital, and, rotational, angular, momenta, of, all, the, bodies, of, the, system, more, than, 60, of, the, total, comes, from, the, orbit, of, jupiter, that, sum, requires, precise, knowledge, of, every, object, in, the, system, making, it, a, somewhat, uncertain, value, because, of, the, uncertainty, regarding, the, exact, location, of, the, invariable, plane, and, because, the, ecliptic, is, well, defined, by, the, apparent, motion, of, the, sun, the, ecliptic, is, used, as, the, reference, plane, of, the, solar, system, both, for, precision, and, convenience, the, only, drawback, of, using, the, ecliptic, instead, of, the, invariable, plane, is, that, over, geologic, time, scales, it, will, move, against, fixed, reference, points, in, the, sky, s, distant, background, the, ecliptic, forms, one, of, the, two, fundamental, planes, used, as, reference, for, positions, on, the, celestial, sphere, the, other, being, the, celestial, equator, perpendicular, to, the, ecliptic, are, the, ecliptic, poles, the, north, ecliptic, pole, being, the, pole, north, of, the, equator, of, the, two, fundamental, planes, the, ecliptic, is, closer, to, unmoving, against, the, background, stars, its, motion, due, to, planetary, precession, being, roughly, 1, 100, that, of, the, celestial, equator, spherical, coordinates, known, as, ecliptic, longitude, and, latitude, or, celestial, longitude, and, latitude, are, used, to, specify, positions, of, bodies, on, the, celestial, sphere, with, respect, to, the, ecliptic, longitude, is, measured, positively, eastward, 0, to, 360, along, the, ecliptic, from, the, march, equinox, the, same, direction, in, which, the, sun, appears, to, move, latitude, is, measured, perpendicular, to, the, ecliptic, to, 90, northward, or, 90, southward, to, the, poles, of, the, ecliptic, the, ecliptic, itself, being, 0, latitude, for, a, complete, spherical, position, a, distance, parameter, is, also, necessary, different, distance, units, are, used, for, different, objects, within, the, solar, system, astronomical, units, are, used, and, for, objects, near, earth, earth, radii, or, kilometers, are, used, a, corresponding, right, handed, rectangular, coordinate, system, is, also, used, occasionally, the, x, axis, is, directed, toward, the, march, equinox, the, y, axis, 90, to, the, east, and, the, z, axis, toward, the, north, ecliptic, pole, the, astronomical, unit, is, the, unit, of, measure, symbols, for, ecliptic, coordinates, are, somewhat, standardized, see, the, table, ecliptic, coordinates, are, convenient, for, specifying, positions, of, solar, system, objects, as, most, of, the, planets, orbits, have, small, inclinations, to, the, ecliptic, and, therefore, always, appear, relatively, close, to, it, on, the, sky, because, earth, s, orbit, and, hence, the, ecliptic, moves, very, little, it, is, a, relatively, fixed, reference, with, respect, to, the, stars, because, of, the, precessional, motion, of, the, equinox, the, ecliptic, coordinates, of, objects, on, the, celestial, sphere, are, continuously, changing, specifying, a, position, in, ecliptic, coordinates, requires, specifying, a, particular, equinox, that, is, the, equinox, of, a, particular, date, known, as, an, epoch, the, coordinates, are, referred, to, the, direction, of, the, equinox, at, that, date, for, instance, the, astronomical, almanac, lists, the, heliocentric, position, of, mars, at, 0h, terrestrial, time, 4, january, 2010, as, longitude, 118, 09, 15, 8, latitude, 1, 43, 16, 7, true, heliocentric, distance, 1, 6302454, au, mean, equinox, and, ecliptic, of, date, this, specifies, the, mean, equinox, of, 4, january, 2010, 0h, tt, as, above, without, the, addition, of, nutation, because, the, orbit, of, the, moon, is, inclined, only, about, 5, 145, to, the, ecliptic, and, the, sun, is, always, very, near, the, ecliptic, eclipses, always, occur, on, or, near, it, because, of, the, inclination, of, the, moon, s, orbit, eclipses, do, not, occur, at, every, conjunction, and, opposition, of, the, sun, and, moon, but, only, when, the, moon, is, near, an, ascending, or, descending, node, at, the, same, time, it, is, at, conjunction, new, or, opposition, full, the, ecliptic, is, so, named, because, the, ancients, noted, that, eclipses, only, occur, when, the, moon, is, crossing, it, the, exact, instants, of, equinoxes, and, solstices, are, the, times, when, the, apparent, ecliptic, longitude, including, the, effects, of, aberration, and, nutation, of, the, sun, is, 0, 90, 180, and, 270, because, of, perturbations, of, earth, s, orbit, and, anomalies, of, the, calendar, the, dates, of, these, are, not, fixed, the, ecliptic, currently, passes, through, the, following, constellations, the, constellations, cetus, orion, and, sextans, are, not, on, the, ecliptic, but, are, close, enough, that, the, moon, and, planets, can, occasionally, appear, in, them, the, ecliptic, forms, the, center, of, the, zodiac, a, celestial, belt, about, 20, wide, in, latitude, through, which, the, sun, moon, and, planets, always, appear, to, move, traditionally, this, region, is, divided, into, 12, signs, of, 30, longitude, each, of, which, approximates, the, sun, s, motion, in, one, month, in, ancient, times, the, signs, corresponded, roughly, to, 12, of, the, constellations, that, straddle, the, ecliptic, these, signs, are, sometimes, still, used, in, modern, terminology, the, first, point, of, aries, was, named, when, the, march, equinox, sun, was, actually, in, the, constellation, aries, it, has, since, moved, into, pisces, because, of, precession, of, the, equinoxes
