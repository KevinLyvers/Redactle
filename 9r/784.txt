an, ice, shelf, is, a, large, platform, of, glacial, ice, floating, on, the, ocean, fed, by, one, or, multiple, tributary, glaciers, ice, shelves, form, along, coastlines, where, the, ice, thickness, is, insufficient, to, displace, the, more, dense, surrounding, ocean, water, the, boundary, between, the, ice, shelf, floating, and, grounded, ice, resting, on, bedrock, or, sediment, is, referred, to, as, the, grounding, line, the, boundary, between, the, ice, shelf, and, the, open, ocean, often, covered, by, sea, ice, is, the, ice, front, or, calving, front, ice, shelves, are, found, in, antarctica, and, the, arctic, greenland, northern, canada, and, the, russian, arctic, and, can, range, in, thickness, from, about, 100, 1, 000, m, 330, 3, 280, ft, the, world, s, largest, ice, shelves, are, the, ross, ice, shelf, and, the, filchner, ronne, ice, shelf, in, antarctica, the, movement, of, ice, shelves, is, principally, driven, by, gravity, induced, pressure, from, the, grounded, ice, that, flow, continually, moves, ice, from, the, grounding, line, to, the, seaward, front, of, the, shelf, typically, a, shelf, front, will, extend, forward, for, years, or, decades, between, major, calving, events, calving, is, the, sudden, release, and, breaking, away, of, a, mass, of, ice, from, a, glacier, iceberg, ice, front, ice, shelf, or, crevasse, snow, accumulation, on, the, upper, surface, and, melting, from, the, lower, surface, are, also, important, to, the, mass, balance, of, an, ice, shelf, ice, may, also, accrete, onto, the, underside, of, the, shelf, the, effects, of, climate, change, are, visible, in, the, changes, to, the, cryosphere, such, as, reduction, in, sea, ice, and, ice, sheets, and, disruption, of, ice, shelves, in, the, last, several, decades, glaciologists, have, observed, consistent, decreases, in, ice, shelf, extent, through, melt, calving, and, complete, disintegration, of, some, shelves, well, studied, examples, include, disruptions, of, the, thwaites, ice, shelf, larsen, ice, shelf, filchner, ronne, ice, shelf, all, three, in, the, antarctic, and, the, disruption, of, the, ellesmere, ice, shelf, in, the, arctic, an, ice, shelf, is, a, floating, slab, of, ice, originating, from, land, of, considerable, thickness, extending, from, the, coast, usually, of, great, horizontal, extent, with, a, very, gently, sloping, surface, resulting, from, the, flow, of, ice, sheets, initially, formed, by, the, accumulation, of, snow, and, often, filling, embayments, in, the, coastline, of, an, ice, sheet, 2234, in, contrast, sea, ice, is, formed, on, water, is, much, thinner, typically, less, than, 3, m, 9, 8, ft, and, forms, throughout, the, arctic, ocean, it, is, also, found, in, the, southern, ocean, around, the, continent, of, antarctica, the, term, captured, ice, shelf, has, been, used, for, the, ice, over, a, subglacial, lake, such, as, lake, vostok, ice, shelves, are, thick, plates, of, ice, formed, continuously, by, glaciers, that, float, atop, an, ocean, the, shelves, act, as, brakes, for, the, glaciers, these, shelves, serve, another, important, purpose, they, moderate, the, amount, of, melting, that, occurs, on, the, glaciers, surfaces, once, their, ice, shelves, are, removed, the, glaciers, increase, in, speed, due, to, meltwater, percolation, and, or, a, reduction, of, braking, forces, and, they, may, begin, to, dump, more, ice, into, the, ocean, than, they, gather, as, snow, in, their, catchments, glacier, ice, speed, increases, are, already, observed, in, peninsula, areas, where, ice, shelves, disintegrated, in, prior, years, the, density, contrast, between, glacial, ice, and, liquid, water, means, that, at, least, 1, 9, of, the, floating, ice, is, above, the, ocean, surface, depending, on, how, much, pressurized, air, is, contained, in, the, bubbles, within, the, glacial, ice, stemming, from, compressed, snow, the, formula, for, the, denominators, above, is, 1, seawater, glacial, ice, seawater, textstyle, 1, density, of, cold, seawater, is, about, 1028, kg, m, 3, and, that, of, glacial, ice, from, about, 850, kg, m, 3, to, well, below, 920, kg, m, 3, the, limit, for, very, cold, ice, without, bubbles, the, height, of, the, shelf, above, the, sea, can, be, even, larger, if, there, is, much, less, dense, firn, and, snow, above, the, glacier, ice, a, large, portion, of, the, antarctic, coastline, has, ice, shelves, attached, their, aggregate, area, is, over, 1, 550, 000, square, kilometers, 600, 000, square, miles, it, has, been, found, that, of, all, the, ice, shelves, on, earth, nearly, all, of, them, are, in, antarctica, 2234, in, steady, state, about, half, of, antarctica, s, ice, shelf, mass, is, lost, to, basal, melt, and, half, is, lost, to, calving, but, the, relative, importance, of, each, process, varies, significantly, between, ice, shelves, in, recent, decades, antarctica, s, ice, shelves, have, been, out, of, balance, as, they, have, lost, more, mass, to, basal, melt, and, calving, than, has, been, replenished, by, the, influx, of, new, ice, and, snow, the, ross, ice, shelf, is, the, largest, ice, shelf, of, antarctica, as, of, 2013, an, area, of, roughly, 500, 809, square, kilometres, 193, 363, sq, mi, and, about, 800, kilometres, 500, mi, across, about, the, size, of, france, it, is, several, hundred, metres, thick, the, nearly, vertical, ice, front, to, the, open, sea, is, more, than, 600, kilometres, 370, mi, long, and, between, 15, and, 50, metres, 50, and, 160, ft, high, above, the, water, surface, ninety, percent, of, the, floating, ice, however, is, below, the, water, surface, all, canadian, ice, shelves, are, attached, to, ellesmere, island, and, lie, north, of, 82, n, ice, shelves, that, are, still, in, existence, are, the, alfred, ernest, ice, shelf, ward, hunt, ice, shelf, milne, ice, shelf, and, smith, ice, shelf, the, m, clintock, ice, shelf, broke, up, from, 1963, to, 1966, the, ayles, ice, shelf, broke, up, in, 2005, and, the, markham, ice, shelf, broke, up, in, 2008, the, remaining, ice, shelves, have, also, lost, a, significant, amount, of, their, area, over, time, with, the, milne, ice, shelf, being, the, last, to, be, affected, with, it, breaking, off, in, august, 2020, the, matusevich, ice, shelf, was, a, 222, square, kilometers, 86, square, miles, ice, shelf, located, in, severnaya, zemlya, being, fed, by, some, of, the, largest, ice, caps, on, october, revolution, island, the, karpinsky, ice, cap, to, the, south, and, the, rusanov, ice, cap, to, the, north, in, 2012, it, ceased, to, exist, in, the, last, several, decades, glaciologists, have, observed, consistent, decreases, in, ice, shelf, extent, through, melt, calving, and, complete, disintegration, of, some, shelves, well, studied, examples, include, disruptions, of, the, thwaites, ice, shelf, larsen, ice, shelf, filchner, ronne, ice, shelf, all, three, in, the, antarctic, and, the, disruption, of, the, ellesmere, ice, shelf, in, the, arctic, the, effects, of, climate, change, are, visible, in, the, changes, to, the, cryosphere, such, as, reduction, in, sea, ice, and, ice, sheets, and, disruption, of, ice, shelves, thwaites, ice, shelf, is, an, antarctic, ice, shelf, in, the, amundsen, sea, it, was, named, by, acan, after, fredrik, t, thwaites, a, glacial, geologist, and, geomorphologist, the, thwaites, ice, shelf, is, one, of, the, biggest, ice, shelves, in, west, antarctica, though, it, is, highly, unstable, and, disintegrating, rapidly, since, the, 1980s, the, thwaites, glacier, nicknamed, the, doomsday, glacier, has, had, a, net, loss, of, over, 600, billion, tons, of, ice, though, pinning, of, the, thwaites, ice, shelf, has, served, to, slow, the, process, the, thwaites, ice, shelf, has, acted, like, a, dam, for, the, eastern, portion, of, glacier, bracing, it, and, allowing, for, a, slow, melt, rate, in, contrast, to, the, undefended, western, portion, according, to, the, american, geophysical, union, in, a, 2021, study, the, thwaites, eastern, ice, shelf, teis, buttresses, one, third, of, thwaites, glacier, removal, of, the, shelf, has, the, potential, to, increase, the, contribution, of, thwaites, glacier, to, sea, level, rise, by, up, to, 25, as, of, 2021, the, ice, shelf, appears, to, be, losing, its, grip, on, a, submarine, shoal, that, acts, as, a, pinning, point, and, the, shear, margin, that, separates, the, thwaites, eastern, ice, shelf, from, the, thwaites, glacier, tongue, has, extended, further, weakening, the, ice, shelf, connection, to, the, pinning, point, a, sequence, of, sentinel, 1, radar, imagery, shows, that, parallel, wing, and, comb, cracks, have, recently, formed, rifts, at, high, angles, to, the, main, shear, margin, and, are, propagating, into, the, central, part, of, the, ice, shelf, at, rates, as, high, as, 2, km, per, year, satellite, data, ground, penetrating, radar, and, gps, measurements, taken, in, 2021, indicate, that, collapse, of, the, ice, shelf, may, be, initiated, by, intersection, of, rifts, with, hidden, basal, crevasse, zones, as, soon, as, 2026, two, sections, of, antarctica, s, larsen, ice, shelf, broke, apart, into, hundreds, of, unusually, small, fragments, hundreds, of, meters, wide, or, less, in, 1995, and, 2002, larsen, c, calved, a, huge, ice, island, in, 2017, from, 31, january, 2002, to, march, 2002, the, larsen, b, sector, partially, collapsed, and, parts, broke, up, 3, 250, km, 2, 1, 250, sq, mi, of, ice, 220, m, 720, ft, thick, an, area, comparable, to, the, us, state, of, rhode, island, in, 2015, a, study, concluded, that, the, remaining, larsen, b, ice, shelf, would, disintegrate, by, 2020, based, on, observations, of, faster, flow, and, rapid, thinning, of, glaciers, in, the, area, larsen, b, was, stable, for, at, least, 10, 000, years, essentially, the, entire, holocene, period, since, the, last, glacial, period, by, contrast, larsen, a, was, absent, for, a, significant, part, of, that, period, reforming, about, 4, 000, years, ago, despite, its, great, age, the, larsen, b, was, clearly, in, trouble, at, the, time, of, the, collapse, with, warm, currents, eating, away, the, underside, of, the, shelf, it, had, become, a, hotspot, of, global, warming, it, broke, over, a, period, of, three, weeks, or, less, with, a, factor, in, this, fast, break, up, being, the, powerful, effects, of, water, ponds, of, meltwater, formed, on, the, surface, during, the, near, 24, hours, of, daylight, in, the, summertime, flowed, down, into, cracks, and, acting, like, a, multitude, of, wedges, levered, the, shelf, apart, other, likely, factors, in, the, break, up, were, the, higher, ocean, temperatures, and, the, decline, of, the, ice, of, the, peninsula, in, october, 1998, the, iceberg, a, 38, broke, off, the, filchner, ronne, ice, shelf, it, had, an, extent, of, roughly, 150, by, 50, km, and, was, thus, larger, than, delaware, it, later, broke, up, again, into, three, parts, a, similar, sized, calving, in, may, 2000, created, an, iceberg, 167, by, 32, km, in, extent, dubbed, a, 43, the, disintegration, of, this, is, thought, to, have, been, responsible, for, the, november, 2006, sighting, of, several, large, icebergs, from, the, coast, of, the, south, island, of, new, zealand, the, first, time, since, 1931, that, any, icebergs, had, been, observed, from, the, new, zealand, mainland, a, large, group, of, small, icebergs, the, largest, some, 1000, metres, in, length, were, seen, off, the, south, east, coast, of, the, island, with, one, of, them, drifting, close, enough, to, shore, to, be, visible, from, the, hills, above, the, city, of, dunedin, if, these, were, indeed, the, remnants, of, this, calving, then, over, the, course, of, five, and, a, half, years, they, had, travelled, slowly, north, and, also, east, around, over, half, the, globe, a, journey, of, some, 13, 500, km, from, january, 12, and, january, 13, 2010, an, area, of, sea, ice, larger, than, the, state, of, rhode, island, or, one, seventh, the, size, of, wales, broke, away, from, the, ronne, filchner, ice, shelf, and, shattered, into, many, smaller, pieces, the, moderate, resolution, imaging, spectroradiometer, modis, on, nasa, s, aqua, and, terra, satellites, captured, this, event, in, this, series, of, photo, like, images, in, may, 2021, iceberg, a, 76, broke, off, the, northwest, corner, of, the, shelf, at, 4320, km, 2, it, is, larger, than, majorca, several, times, larger, than, iceberg, a, 74, which, calved, in, the, same, year, or, approximately, 14, the, size, of, belgium, the, ice, of, the, filchner, ronne, ice, shelf, can, be, as, thick, as, 600, m, the, water, below, is, about, 1400, m, deep, at, the, deepest, point, the, international, filchner, ronne, ice, shelf, programme, frisp, was, initiated, in, 1973, to, study, the, ice, shelf, the, ellesmere, ice, shelf, was, reduced, by, 90, in, the, twentieth, century, leaving, the, separate, alfred, ernest, ayles, milne, ward, hunt, and, markham, ice, shelves, a, 1986, survey, of, canadian, ice, shelves, found, that, 48, km, 2, 3, 3, cubic, kilometres, of, ice, calved, from, the, milne, and, ayles, ice, shelves, between, 1959, and, 1974, the, ayles, ice, shelf, calved, entirely, on, august, 13, 2005, the, ward, hunt, ice, shelf, the, largest, remaining, section, of, thick, 10, meters, 33, feet, landfast, sea, ice, along, the, northern, coastline, of, ellesmere, island, lost, 600, square, kilometers, 230, square, miles, of, ice, in, a, massive, calving, in, 1961, 1962, it, further, decreased, by, 27, in, thickness, 13, meters, 43, feet, between, 1967, and, 1999, in, the, summer, of, 2002, the, ward, ice, shelf, experienced, another, major, breakup, and, other, instances, of, note, happened, in, 2008, and, 2010, as, well, the, last, remnant, to, remain, mostly, intact, the, milne, ice, shelf, also, ultimately, experienced, a, major, breakup, at, the, end, of, july, 2020, losing, over, 40, of, its, area, the, ellesmere, ice, shelf, was, the, largest, ice, shelf, in, the, arctic, encompassing, about, 9, 100, square, kilometres, 3, 500, square, miles, of, the, north, coast, of, ellesmere, island, nunavut, canada, the, ice, shelf, was, first, documented, by, the, british, arctic, expedition, of, 1875, 76, in, which, lieutenant, pelham, aldrich, s, party, went, from, cape, sheridan, to, cape, alert, the, continuous, mass, of, the, ellesmere, ice, shelf, had, been, in, place, for, at, least, 3, 000, years, during, the, twentieth, century, the, ellesmere, ice, shelf, broke, up, into, six, separate, shelves, from, west, to, east, these, were, the, serson, ice, shelf, petersen, ice, shelf, milne, ice, shelf, ayles, ice, shelf, ward, hunt, ice, shelf, and, markham, ice, shelf, the, smaller, pieces, continued, to, disintegrate, in, april, 2000, satellite, images, revealed, that, a, large, crack, in, the, ward, hunt, shelf, had, begun, to, form, and, in, 2003, it, was, announced, that, the, ice, sheet, had, split, completely, in, two, in, 2002, releasing, a, huge, pool, of, freshwater, from, the, largest, epishelf, lake, in, the, northern, hemisphere, located, in, disraeli, fjord, in, april, 2008, scientists, discovered, that, the, shelf, fractured, into, dozens, of, deep, multi, faceted, cracks, on, august, 13, 2005, the, ayles, ice, shelf, which, was, located, approximately, 800, km, 500, mi, south, of, the, north, pole, broke, away, from, the, coast, forming, the, giant, ayles, ice, island, 37, metres, 121, ft, thick, and, measuring, around, 14, by, 5, km, 8, 7, by, 3, 1, mi, in, size, with, an, area, of, approximately, 66, km, 2, 25, sq, mi, or, 2, 6, km, 3, 0, 62, cu, mi, in,
