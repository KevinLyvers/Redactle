in, astronomy, dark, matter, is, a, hypothetical, form, of, matter, that, does, not, interact, with, light, or, other, electromagnetic, radiation, dark, matter, is, implied, by, gravitational, effects, which, cannot, be, explained, by, general, relativity, unless, more, matter, is, present, than, can, be, observed, such, effects, occur, in, the, context, of, formation, and, evolution, of, galaxies, gravitational, lensing, the, observable, universe, s, current, structure, mass, position, in, galactic, collisions, the, motion, of, galaxies, within, galaxy, clusters, and, cosmic, microwave, background, anisotropies, in, the, standard, lambda, cdm, model, of, cosmology, the, mass, energy, content, of, the, universe, is, 5, ordinary, matter, 26, 8, dark, matter, and, 68, 2, a, form, of, energy, known, as, dark, energy, thus, dark, matter, constitutes, 85, of, the, total, mass, while, dark, energy, and, dark, matter, constitute, 95, of, the, total, mass, energy, content, dark, matter, is, not, known, to, interact, with, ordinary, baryonic, matter, and, radiation, except, through, gravity, making, it, difficult, to, detect, in, the, laboratory, the, most, prevalent, explanation, is, that, dark, matter, is, some, as, yet, undiscovered, subatomic, particle, such, as, either, weakly, interacting, massive, particles, wimps, or, axions, the, other, main, possibility, is, that, dark, matter, is, composed, of, primordial, black, holes, dark, matter, is, classified, as, cold, warm, or, hot, according, to, velocity, more, precisely, its, free, streaming, length, recent, models, have, favored, a, cold, dark, matter, scenario, in, which, structures, emerge, by, the, gradual, accumulation, of, particles, although, the, astrophysics, community, generally, accepts, dark, matter, s, existence, a, minority, of, astrophysicists, intrigued, by, specific, observations, that, are, not, well, explained, by, ordinary, dark, matter, argue, for, various, modifications, of, the, standard, laws, of, general, relativity, these, include, modified, newtonian, dynamics, tensor, vector, scalar, gravity, or, entropic, gravity, so, far, none, of, the, proposed, modified, gravity, theories, can, describe, every, piece, of, observational, evidence, at, the, same, time, suggesting, that, even, if, gravity, has, to, be, modified, some, form, of, dark, matter, will, still, be, required, the, hypothesis, of, dark, matter, has, an, elaborate, history, in, the, appendices, of, the, book, baltimore, lectures, on, molecular, dynamics, and, the, wave, theory, of, light, where, the, main, text, was, based, on, a, series, of, lectures, given, in, 1884, lord, kelvin, discussed, the, potential, number, of, stars, around, the, sun, from, the, observed, velocity, dispersion, of, the, stars, near, the, sun, assuming, that, the, sun, was, 20, to, 100, million, years, old, he, posed, what, would, happen, if, there, were, a, thousand, million, stars, within, 1, kiloparsec, of, the, sun, at, which, distance, their, parallax, would, be, 1, milliarcsecond, lord, kelvin, concluded, many, of, our, supposed, thousand, million, stars, perhaps, a, great, majority, of, them, may, be, dark, bodies, in, 1906, henri, poincar, in, the, milky, way, and, theory, of, gases, used, the, french, term, mati, re, obscure, dark, matter, in, discussing, kelvin, s, work, he, found, that, the, amount, of, dark, matter, would, need, to, be, less, than, that, of, visible, matter, the, second, to, suggest, the, existence, of, dark, matter, using, stellar, velocities, was, dutch, astronomer, jacobus, kapteyn, in, 1922, a, publication, from, 1930, points, to, swedish, knut, lundmark, being, the, first, to, realise, that, the, universe, must, contain, much, more, mass, than, can, be, observed, dutchman, and, radio, astronomy, pioneer, jan, oort, also, hypothesized, the, existence, of, dark, matter, in, 1932, oort, was, studying, stellar, motions, in, the, local, galactic, neighborhood, and, found, the, mass, in, the, galactic, plane, must, be, greater, than, what, was, observed, but, this, measurement, was, later, determined, to, be, erroneous, in, 1933, swiss, astrophysicist, fritz, zwicky, who, studied, galaxy, clusters, while, working, at, the, california, institute, of, technology, made, a, similar, inference, zwicky, applied, the, virial, theorem, to, the, coma, cluster, and, obtained, evidence, of, unseen, mass, he, called, dunkle, materie, dark, matter, zwicky, estimated, its, mass, based, on, the, motions, of, galaxies, near, its, edge, and, compared, that, to, an, estimate, based, on, its, brightness, and, number, of, galaxies, he, estimated, the, cluster, had, about, 400, times, more, mass, than, was, visually, observable, the, gravity, effect, of, the, visible, galaxies, was, far, too, small, for, such, fast, orbits, thus, mass, must, be, hidden, from, view, based, on, these, conclusions, zwicky, inferred, some, unseen, matter, provided, the, mass, and, associated, gravitation, attraction, to, hold, the, cluster, together, zwicky, s, estimates, were, off, by, more, than, an, order, of, magnitude, mainly, due, to, an, obsolete, value, of, the, hubble, constant, the, same, calculation, today, shows, a, smaller, fraction, using, greater, values, for, luminous, mass, nonetheless, zwicky, did, correctly, conclude, from, his, calculation, that, the, bulk, of, the, matter, was, dark, further, indications, of, mass, to, light, ratio, anomalies, came, from, measurements, of, galaxy, rotation, curves, in, 1939, horace, w, babcock, reported, the, rotation, curve, for, the, andromeda, nebula, known, now, as, the, andromeda, galaxy, which, suggested, the, mass, to, luminosity, ratio, increases, radially, he, attributed, it, to, either, light, absorption, within, the, galaxy, or, modified, dynamics, in, the, outer, portions, of, the, spiral, and, not, to, the, missing, matter, he, had, uncovered, following, babcock, s, 1939, report, of, unexpectedly, rapid, rotation, in, the, outskirts, of, the, andromeda, galaxy, and, a, mass, to, light, ratio, of, 50, in, 1940, jan, oort, discovered, and, wrote, about, the, large, non, visible, halo, of, ngc, 3115, early, radio, astronomy, observations, performed, by, seth, shostak, later, seti, institute, senior, astronomer, showed, a, half, dozen, galaxies, spun, too, fast, in, their, outer, regions, pointing, to, the, existence, of, dark, matter, as, a, means, of, creating, the, gravitational, pull, needed, to, keep, the, stars, in, their, orbits, the, hypothesis, of, dark, matter, largely, took, root, in, the, 1970s, several, different, observations, were, synthesized, to, argue, that, galaxies, should, be, surrounded, by, halos, of, unseen, matter, in, two, papers, that, appeared, in, 1974, this, conclusion, was, drawn, in, tandem, by, independent, groups, in, princeton, u, s, a, by, jeremiah, ostriker, jim, peebles, and, amos, yahil, and, in, tartu, estonia, by, jaan, einasto, enn, saar, and, ants, kaasik, one, of, the, observations, that, served, as, evidence, for, the, existence, of, galactic, halos, of, dark, matter, was, the, shape, of, galaxy, rotation, curves, these, observations, were, done, in, optical, and, radio, astronomy, in, optical, astronomy, vera, rubin, and, kent, ford, worked, with, a, new, spectrograph, to, measure, the, velocity, curve, of, edge, on, spiral, galaxies, with, greater, accuracy, at, the, same, time, radio, astronomers, were, making, use, of, new, radio, telescopes, to, map, the, 21, cm, line, of, atomic, hydrogen, in, nearby, galaxies, the, radial, distribution, of, interstellar, atomic, hydrogen, h, i, often, extends, to, much, greater, galactic, distances, than, can, be, observed, as, collective, starlight, expanding, the, sampled, distances, for, rotation, curves, and, thus, of, the, total, mass, distribution, to, a, new, dynamical, regime, early, mapping, of, andromeda, with, the, 300, foot, telescope, at, green, bank, and, the, 250, foot, dish, at, jodrell, bank, already, showed, the, h, i, rotation, curve, did, not, trace, the, expected, keplerian, decline, as, more, sensitive, receivers, became, available, roberts, whitehurst, 1975, were, able, to, trace, the, rotational, velocity, of, andromeda, to, 30, kpc, much, beyond, the, optical, measurements, illustrating, the, advantage, of, tracing, the, gas, disk, at, large, radii, that, paper, s, figure, 16, combines, the, optical, data, the, cluster, of, points, at, radii, of, less, than, 15, kpc, with, a, single, point, further, out, with, the, h, i, data, between, 20, and, 30, kpc, exhibiting, the, flatness, of, the, outer, galaxy, rotation, curve, the, solid, curve, peaking, at, the, center, is, the, optical, surface, density, while, the, other, curve, shows, the, cumulative, mass, still, rising, linearly, at, the, outermost, measurement, in, parallel, the, use, of, interferometric, arrays, for, extragalactic, h, i, spectroscopy, was, being, developed, rogstad, shostak, 1972, published, h, i, rotation, curves, of, five, spirals, mapped, with, the, owens, valley, interferometer, the, rotation, curves, of, all, five, were, very, flat, suggesting, very, large, values, of, mass, to, light, ratio, in, the, outer, parts, of, their, extended, h, i, disks, in, 1978, albert, bosma, showed, further, evidence, of, flat, rotation, curves, using, data, from, the, westerbork, synthesis, radio, telescope, by, the, late, 1970s, the, existence, of, dark, matter, halos, around, galaxies, was, widely, recognized, as, real, and, became, a, major, unsolved, problem, in, astronomy, a, stream, of, observations, in, the, 1980, 90s, supported, the, presence, of, dark, matter, notable, for, spirals, the, investigation, of, 967, objects, by, persic, salucci, and, stel, the, evidence, for, dark, matter, also, included, gravitational, lensing, of, background, objects, by, galaxy, clusters, 14, 16, the, temperature, distribution, of, hot, gas, in, galaxies, and, clusters, and, the, pattern, of, anisotropies, in, the, cosmic, microwave, background, according, to, consensus, among, cosmologists, dark, matter, is, composed, primarily, of, a, not, yet, characterized, type, of, subatomic, particle, the, search, for, this, particle, by, a, variety, of, means, is, one, of, the, major, efforts, in, particle, physics, in, standard, cosmological, calculations, matter, means, any, constituent, of, the, universe, whose, energy, density, scales, with, the, inverse, cube, of, the, scale, factor, i, e, a, 3, this, is, in, contrast, to, radiation, which, scales, as, the, inverse, fourth, power, of, the, scale, factor, a, 4, and, a, cosmological, constant, which, does, not, change, with, respect, to, a, a, 0, the, different, scaling, factors, for, matter, and, radiation, are, a, consequence, of, radiation, redshift, for, example, after, gradually, doubling, the, diameter, of, the, observable, universe, via, cosmic, expansion, of, general, relativity, the, scale, a, has, doubled, the, energy, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, radiation, has, been, halved, because, the, wavelength, of, each, photon, has, doubled, the, energy, of, ultra, relativistic, particles, such, as, early, era, standard, model, neutrinos, is, similarly, halved, the, cosmological, constant, as, an, intrinsic, property, of, space, has, a, constant, energy, density, regardless, of, the, volume, under, consideration, in, principle, dark, matter, means, all, components, of, the, universe, which, are, not, visible, but, still, obey, a, 3, in, practice, the, term, dark, matter, is, often, used, to, mean, only, the, non, baryonic, component, of, dark, matter, i, e, excluding, missing, baryons, context, will, usually, indicate, which, meaning, is, intended, the, arms, of, spiral, galaxies, rotate, around, the, galactic, center, the, luminous, mass, density, of, a, spiral, galaxy, decreases, as, one, goes, from, the, center, to, the, outskirts, if, luminous, mass, were, all, the, matter, then, we, can, model, the, galaxy, as, a, point, mass, in, the, centre, and, test, masses, orbiting, around, it, similar, to, the, solar, system, from, kepler, s, third, law, it, is, expected, that, the, rotation, velocities, will, decrease, with, distance, from, the, center, similar, to, the, solar, system, this, is, not, observed, instead, the, galaxy, rotation, curve, remains, flat, or, even, increases, as, distance, from, the, center, increases, if, kepler, s, laws, are, correct, then, the, obvious, way, to, resolve, this, discrepancy, is, to, conclude, the, mass, distribution, in, spiral, galaxies, is, not, similar, to, that, of, the, solar, system, in, particular, there, is, a, lot, of, non, luminous, matter, dark, matter, in, the, outskirts, of, the, galaxy, stars, in, bound, systems, must, obey, the, virial, theorem, the, theorem, together, with, the, measured, velocity, distribution, can, be, used, to, measure, the, mass, distribution, in, a, bound, system, such, as, elliptical, galaxies, or, globular, clusters, with, some, exceptions, velocity, dispersion, estimates, of, elliptical, galaxies, do, not, match, the, predicted, velocity, dispersion, from, the, observed, mass, distribution, even, assuming, complicated, distributions, of, stellar, orbits, as, with, galaxy, rotation, curves, the, obvious, way, to, resolve, the, discrepancy, is, to, postulate, the, existence, of, non, luminous, matter, galaxy, clusters, are, particularly, important, for, dark, matter, studies, since, their, masses, can, be, estimated, in, three, independent, ways, generally, these, three, methods, are, in, reasonable, agreement, that, dark, matter, outweighs, visible, matter, by, approximately, 5, to, 1, one, of, the, consequences, of, general, relativity, is, the, gravitational, lens, gravitational, lensing, occurs, when, massive, objects, between, a, source, of, light, and, the, observer, act, as, a, lens, to, bend, light, from, this, source, lensing, does, not, depend, on, the, properties, of, the, mass, it, only, requires, there, to, be, a, mass, the, more, massive, an, object, the, more, lensing, is, observed, an, example, is, a, cluster, of, galaxies, lying, between, a, more, distant, source, such, as, a, quasar, and, an, observer, in, this, case, the, galaxy, cluster, will, lens, the, quasar, strong, lensing, is, the, observed, distortion, of, background, galaxies, into, arcs, when, their, light, passes, through, such, a, gravitational, lens, it, has, been, observed, around, many, distant, clusters, including, abell, 1689, by, measuring, the, distortion, geometry, the, mass, of, the, intervening, cluster, can, be, obtained, in, the, weak, regime, lensing, does, not, distort, background, galaxies, into, arcs, causing, minute, distortions, instead, by, examining, the, apparent, shear, deformation, of, the, adjacent, background, galaxies, the, mean, distribution, of, dark, matter, can, be, characterized, the, measured, mass, to, light, ratios, correspond, to, dark, matter, densities, predicted, by, other, large, scale, structure, measurements, although, both, dark, matter, and, ordinary, matter, are, matter, they, do, not, behave, in, the, same, way, in, particular, in, the, early, universe, ordinary, matter, was, ionized, and, interacted, strongly, with, radiation, via, thomson, scattering, dark, matter, does, not, interact, directly, with, radiation, but, it, does, affect, the, cosmic, microwave, background, cmb, by, its, gravitational, potential, mainly, on, large, scales, and, by, its, effects, on, the, density, and, velocity, of, ordinary, matter, ordinary, and, dark, matter, perturbations, therefore, evolve, differently, with, time, and, leave, different, imprints, on, the, cmb, the, cosmic, microwave, background, is, very, close, to, a, perfect, blackbody, but, contains, very, small, temperature, anisotropies, of, a, few, parts, in, 100, 000, a, sky, map, of, anisotropies, can, be, decomposed, into, an, angular, power, spectrum, which, is, observed, to, contain, a, series, of, acoustic, peaks, at, near, equal, spacing, but, different, heights, the, locations, of, these, peaks, depend, on, cosmological, parameters, matching, theory, to, data, therefore, constrains, cosmological, parameters, the, cmb, anisotropy, was, first, discovered, by, cobe, in, 1992, though, this, had, too, coarse, resolution, to, detect, the, acoustic, peaks, after, the, discovery, of, the, first, acoustic, peak, by, the, balloon, borne, boomerang, experiment, in, 2000, the, power, spectrum, was, precisely, observed, by, wmap, in, 2003, 2012, and, even, more, precisely, by, the, planck, spacecraft, in, 2013, 2015, the, results, support, the, lambda, cdm, model, the, observed, cmb, angular, power, spectrum, provides, powerful, evidence, in, support, of, dark, matter, as, its, precise, structure, is, well, fitted, by, the, lambda, cdm, model, but, difficult, to, reproduce, with, any, competing, model, such, as, modified, newtonian, dynamics, mond, structure, formation, refers, to, the, period, after, the, big, bang, when, density, perturbations, collapsed, to, form, stars, galaxies, and, clusters, prior, to, structure, formation, the, friedmann, solutions, to, general, relativity, describe, a, homogeneous, universe, later, small, anisotropies, gradually, grew, and, condensed, the, homogeneous, universe, into, stars, galaxies, and, larger, structures, ordinary, matter, is, affected, by, radiation, which, is, the, dominant, element, of, the, universe, at, very, early, times, as, a, result, its, density, perturbations, are, washed, out, and, unable, to, condense, into, structure, if, there, were, only, ordinary, matter, in, the, universe, there, would, not, have, been, enough, time, for, density, perturbations, to, grow, into, the, galaxies, and, clusters, currently, seen, dark, matter, provides, a, solution, to, this, problem, because, it, is, unaffected, by, radiation, therefore, its, density, perturbations, can, grow, first, the, resulting, gravitational, potential, acts, as, an, attractive, potential, well, for, ordinary, matter, collapsing, later, speeding, up, the, structure, formation, process, the, bullet, cluster, is, the, result, of, a, recent, collision, of, two, galaxy, clusters, it, is, of, particular, note, because, the, location, of, the, center, of, mass, as, measured, by, gravitational, lensing, is, different, from, the, location, of, the, center, of, mass, of, visible, matter, this, is, difficult, for, modified, gravity, theories, which, generally, predict, lensing, around, visible, matter, to, explain, standard, dark, matter, theory, however, has, no, issue, the, hot, visible, gas, in, each, cluster, would, be, cooled, and, slowed, down, by, electromagnetic, interactions, while, dark, matter, which, does, not, interact, electromagnetically, would, not, this, leads, to, the, dark, matter, separating, from, the, visible, gas, producing, the, separate, lensing, peak, as, observed, type, ia, supernovae, can, be, used, as, standard, candles, to, measure, extragalactic, distances, which, can, in, turn, be, used, to, measure, how, fast, the, universe, has, expanded, in, the, past, data, indicates, the, universe, is, expanding, at, an, accelerating, rate, the, cause, of, which, is, usually, ascribed, to, dark, energy, since, observations, indicate, the, universe, is, almost, flat, it, is, expected, the, total, energy, density, of, everything, in, the, universe, should, sum, to, 1, tot, 1, the, measured, dark, energy, density, is, 0, 690, the, observed, ordinary, baryonic, matter, energy, density, is, b, 0, 0482, and, the, energy, density, of, radiation, is, negligible, this, leaves, a, missing, dm, 0, 258, which, nonetheless, behaves, like, matter, see, technical, definition, section, above, dark, matter, baryon, acoustic, oscillations, bao, are, fluctuations, in, the, density, of, the, visible, baryonic, matter, normal, matter, of, the, universe, on, large, scales, these, are, predicted, to, arise, in, the, lambda, cdm, model, due, to, acoustic, oscillations, in, the, photon, baryon, fluid, of, the, early, universe, and, can, be, observed, in, the, cosmic, microwave, background, angular, power, spectrum, baos, set, up, a, preferred, length, scale, for, baryons, as, the, dark, matter, and, baryons, clumped, together, after, recombination, the, effect, is, much, weaker, in, the, galaxy, distribution, in, the, nearby, universe, but, is, detectable, as, a, subtle, 1, percent, preference, for, pairs, of, galaxies, to, be, separated, by, 147, mpc, compared, to, those, separated, by, 130, 160, mpc, this, feature, was, predicted, theoretically, in, the, 1990s, and, then, discovered, in, 2005, in, two, large, galaxy, redshift, surveys, the, sloan, digital, sky, survey, and, the, 2df, galaxy, redshift, survey, combining, the, cmb, observations, with, bao, measurements, from, galaxy, redshift, surveys, provides, a, precise, estimate, of, the, hubble, constant, and, the, average, matter, density, in, the, universe, the, results, support, the, lambda, cdm, model, large, galaxy, redshift, surveys, may, be, used, to, make, a, three, dimensional, map, of, the, galaxy, distribution, these, maps, are, slightly, distorted, because, distances, are, estimated, from, observed, redshifts, the, redshift, contains, a, contribution, from, the, galaxy, s, so, called, peculiar, velocity, in, addition, to, the, dominant, hubble, expansion, term, on, average, superclusters, are, expanding, more, slowly, than, the, cosmic, mean, due, to, their, gravity, while, voids, are, expanding, faster, than, average, in, a, redshift, map, galaxies, in, front, of, a, supercluster, have, excess, radial, velocities, towards, it, and, have, redshifts, slightly, higher, than, their, distance, would, imply, while, galaxies, behind, the, supercluster, have, redshifts, slightly, low, for, their, distance, this, effect, causes, superclusters, to, appear, squashed, in, the, radial, direction, and, likewise, voids, are, stretched, their, angular, positions, are, unaffected, this, effect, is, not, detectable, for, any, one, structure, since, the, true, shape, is, not, known, but, can, be, measured, by, averaging, over, many, structures, it, was, predicted, quantitatively, by, nick, kaiser, in, 1987, and, first, decisively, measured, in, 2001, by, the, 2df, galaxy, redshift, survey, results, are, in, agreement, with, the, lambda, cdm, model, in, astronomical, spectroscopy, the, lyman, alpha, forest, is, the, sum, of, the, absorption, lines, arising, from, the, lyman, alpha, transition, of, neutral, hydrogen, in, the, spectra, of, distant, galaxies, and, quasars, lyman, alpha, forest, observations, can, also, constrain, cosmological, models, these, constraints, agree, with, those, obtained, from, wmap, data, the, identity, of, dark, matter, is, unknown, but, there, are, many, hypotheses, about, what, dark, matter, could, consist, of, as, set, out, in, the, table, below, dark, matter, can, refer, to, any, substance, which, interacts, predominantly, via, gravity, with, visible, matter, e, g, stars, and, planets, hence, in, principle, it, need, not, be, composed, of, a, new, type, of, fundamental, particle, but, could, at, least, in, part, be, made, up, of, standard, baryonic, matter, such, as, protons, or, neutrons, most, of, the, ordinary, matter, familiar, to, astronomers, including, planets, brown, dwarfs, red, dwarfs, visible, stars, white, dwarfs, neutron, stars, and, black, holes, fall, into, this, category, solitary, black, holes, neutron, stars, burnt, out, dwarfs, and, other, massive, objects, that, are, hard, to, detect, are, collectively, known, as, machos, some, scientists, initially, hoped, that, baryonic, machos, could, account, for, and, explain, all, the, dark, matter, 286, however, multiple, lines, of, evidence, suggest, the, majority, of, dark, matter, is, not, baryonic, there, are, two, main, candidates, for, non, baryonic, dark, matter, hypothetical, particles, such, as, axions, sterile, neutrinos, weakly, interacting, massive, particle, wimps, supersymmetric, particles, atomic, dark, matter, or, geons, and, primordial, black, holes, once, a, black, hole, ingests, either, kind, of, matter, baryonic, or, not, the, distinction, is, lost, unlike, baryonic, matter, nonbaryonic, particles, do, not, contribute, to, the, formation, of, the, elements, in, the, early, universe, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, and, so, its, presence, is, revealed, only, via, its, gravitational, effects, or, weak, lensing, in, addition, if, the, particles, of, which, it, is, composed, are, supersymmetric, they, can, undergo, annihilation, interactions, with, themselves, possibly, resulting, in, observable, by, products, such, as, gamma, rays, and, neutrinos, indirect, detection, in, 2015, the, idea, that, dense, dark, matter, was, composed, of, primordial, black, holes, made, a, comeback, following, results, of, gravitational, wave, measurements, which, detected, the, merger, of, intermediate, mass, black, holes, black, holes, with, about, 30, solar, masses, are, not, predicted, to, form, by, either, stellar, collapse, typically, less, than, 15, solar, masses, or, by, the, merger, of, black, holes, in, galactic, centers, millions, or, billions, of, solar, masses, it, was, proposed, that, the, intermediate, mass, black, holes, causing, the, detected, merger, formed, in, the, hot, dense, early, phase, of, the, universe, due, to, denser, regions, collapsing, a, later, survey, of, about, a, thousand, supernovae, detected, no, gravitational, lensing, events, when, about, eight, would, be, expected, if, intermediate, mass, primordial, black, holes, above, a, certain, mass, range, accounted, for, over, 60, of, dark, matter, however, that, study, assumed, a, monochromatic, distribution, to, represent, the, ligo, virgo, mass, range, which, is, inapplicable, to, the, broadly, platykurtic, mass, distribution, suggested, by, subsequent, james, webb, space, telescope, observations, the, possibility, that, atom, sized, primordial, black, holes, account, for, a, significant, fraction, of, dark, matter, was, ruled, out, by, measurements, of, positron, and, electron, fluxes, outside, the, sun, s, heliosphere, by, the, voyager, 1, spacecraft, tiny, black, holes, are, theorized, to, emit, hawking, radiation, however, the, detected, fluxes, were, too, low, and, did, not, have, the, expected, energy, spectrum, suggesting, that, tiny, primordial, black, holes, are, not, widespread, enough, to, account, for, dark, matter, nonetheless, research, and, theories, proposing, dense, dark, matter, accounts, for, dark, matter, continue, as, of, 2018, including, approaches, to, dark, matter, cooling, and, the, question, remains, unsettled, in, 2019, the, lack, of, microlensing, effects, in, the, observation, of, andromeda, suggests, that, tiny, black, holes, do, not, exist, however, there, still, exists, a, largely, unconstrained, mass, range, smaller, than, that, which, can, be, limited, by, optical, microlensing, observations, where, primordial, black, holes, may, account, for, all, dark, matter, dark, matter, can, be, divided, into, cold, warm, and, hot, categories, these, categories, refer, to, velocity, rather, than, an, actual, temperature, indicating, how, far, corresponding, objects, moved, due, to, random, motions, in, the, early, universe, before, they, slowed, due, to, cosmic, expansion, this, is, an, important, distance, called, the, free, streaming, length, fsl, primordial, density, fluctuations, smaller, than, this, length, get, washed, out, as, particles, spread, from, overdense, to, underdense, regions, while, larger, fluctuations, are, unaffected, therefore, this, length, sets, a, minimum, scale, for, later, structure, formation, the, categories, are, set, with, respect, to, the, size, of, a, protogalaxy, an, object, that, later, evolves, into, a, dwarf, galaxy, dark, matter, particles, are, classified, as, cold, warm, or, hot, according, to, their, fsl, much, smaller, cold, similar, to, warm, or, much, larger, hot, than, a, protogalaxy, mixtures, of, the, above, are, also, possible, a, theory, of, mixed, dark, matter, was, popular, in, the, mid, 1990s, but, was, rejected, following, the, discovery, of, dark, energy, cold, dark, matter, leads, to, a, bottom, up, formation, of, structure, with, galaxies, forming, first, and, galaxy, clusters, at, a, latter, stage, while, hot, dark, matter, would, result, in, a, top, down, formation, scenario, with, large, matter, aggregations, forming, early, later, fragmenting, into, separate, galaxies, the, latter, is, excluded, by, high, redshift, galaxy, observations, these, categories, also, correspond, to, fluctuation, spectrum, effects, and, the, interval, following, the, big, bang, at, which, each, type, became, non, relativistic, davis, et, al, wrote, in, 1985, candidate, particles, can, be, grouped, into, three, categories, on, the, basis, of, their, effect, on, the, fluctuation, spectrum, bond, et, al, 1983, if, the, dark, matter, is, composed, of, abundant, light, particles, which, remain, relativistic, until, shortly, before, recombination, then, it, may, be, termed, hot, the, best, candidate, for, hot, dark, matter, is, a, neutrino, a, second, possibility, is, for, the, dark, matter, particles, to, interact, more, weakly, than, neutrinos, to, be, less, abundant, and, to, have, a, mass, of, order, 1, kev, such, particles, are, termed, warm, dark, matter, because, they, have, lower, thermal, velocities, than, massive, neutrinos, there, are, at, present, few, candidate, particles, which, fit, this, description, gravitinos, and, photinos, have, been, suggested, pagels, and, primack, 1982, bond, szalay, and, turner, 1982, any, particles, which, became, nonrelativistic, very, early, and, so, were, able, to, diffuse, a, negligible, distance, are, termed, cold, dark, matter, cdm, there, are, many, candidates, for, cdm, including, supersymmetric, particles, another, approximate, dividing, line, is, warm, dark, matter, became, non, relativistic, when, the, universe, was, approximately, 1, year, old, and, 1, millionth, of, its, present, size, and, in, the, radiation, dominated, era, photons, and, neutrinos, with, a, photon, temperature, 2, 7, million, kelvins, standard, physical, cosmology, gives, the, particle, horizon, size, as, 2, c, t, displaystyle, 2ct, speed, of, light, multiplied, by, time, in, the, radiation, dominated, era, thus, 2, light, years, a, region, of, this, size, would, expand, to, 2, million, light, years, today, absent, structure, formation, the, actual, fsl, is, approximately, 5, times, the, above, length, since, it, continues, to, grow, slowly, as, particle, velocities, decrease, inversely, with, the, scale, factor, after, they, become, non, relativistic, in, this, example, the, fsl, would, correspond, to, 10, million, light, years, or, 3, mega, parsecs, today, around, the, size, containing, an, average, large, galaxy, the, 2, 7, million, kelvin, photon, temperature, gives, a, typical, photon, energy, of, 250, electronvolt, thereby, setting, a, typical, mass, scale, for, warm, dark, matter, particles, much, more, massive, than, this, such, as, gev, tev, mass, wimps, would, become, non, relativistic, much, earlier, than, one, year, after, the, big, bang, and, thus, have, fsls, much, smaller, than, a, protogalaxy, making, them, cold, conversely, much, lighter, particles, such, as, neutrinos, with, masses, of, only, a, few, electronvolt, have, fsls, much, larger, than, a, protogalaxy, thus, qualifying, them, as, hot, cold, dark, matter, offers, the, simplest, explanation, for, most, cosmological, observations, it, is, dark, matter, composed, of, constituents, with, an, fsl, much, smaller, than, a, protogalaxy, this, is, the, focus, for, dark, matter, research, as, hot, dark, matter, does, not, seem, capable, of, supporting, galaxy, or, galaxy, cluster, formation, and, most, particle, candidates, slowed, early, the, constituents, of, cold, dark, matter, are, unknown, possibilities, range, from, large, objects, like, machos, such, as, black, holes, and, preon, stars, or, rambos, such, as, clusters, of, brown, dwarfs, to, new, particles, such, as, wimps, and, axions, the, 1997, dama, nai, experiment, and, its, successor, dama, libra, in, 2013, claimed, to, directly, detect, dark, matter, particles, passing, through, the, earth, but, many, researchers, remain, skeptical, as, negative, results, from, similar, experiments, seem, incompatible, with, the, dama, results, many, supersymmetric, models, offer, dark, matter, candidates, in, the, form, of, the, wimpy, lightest, supersymmetric, particle, lsp, separately, heavy, sterile, neutrinos, exist, in, non, supersymmetric, extensions, to, the, standard, model, which, explain, the, small, neutrino, mass, through, the, seesaw, mechanism, warm, dark, matter, comprises, particles, with, an, fsl, comparable, to, the, size, of, a, protogalaxy, predictions, based, on, warm, dark, matter, are, similar, to, those, for, cold, dark, matter, on, large, scales, but, with, less, small, scale, density, perturbations, this, reduces, the, predicted, abundance, of, dwarf, galaxies, and, may, lead, to, lower, density, of, dark, matter, in, the, central, parts, of, large, galaxies, some, researchers, consider, this, a, better, fit, to, observations, a, challenge, for, this, model, is, the, lack, of, particle, candidates, with, the, required, mass, 300, ev, to, 3000, ev, no, known, particles, can, be, categorized, as, warm, dark, matter, a, postulated, candidate, is, the, sterile, neutrino, a, heavier, slower, form, of, neutrino, that, does, not, interact, through, the, weak, force, unlike, other, neutrinos, some, modified, gravity, theories, such, as, scalar, tensor, vector, gravity, require, warm, dark, matter, to, make, their, equations, work, hot, dark, matter, consists, of, particles, whose, fsl, is, much, larger, than, the, size, of, a, protogalaxy, the, neutrino, qualifies, as, such, a, particle, they, were, discovered, independently, long, before, the, hunt, for, dark, matter, they, were, postulated, in, 1930, and, detected, in, 1956, neutrinos, mass, is, less, than, 10, 6, that, of, an, electron, neutrinos, interact, with, normal, matter, only, via, gravity, and, the, weak, force, making, them, difficult, to, detect, the, weak, force, only, works, over, a, small, distance, thus, a, neutrino, triggers, a, weak, force, event, only, if, it, hits, a, nucleus, head, on, this, makes, them, weakly, interacting, slender, particles, wisps, as, opposed, to, wimps, the, three, known, flavours, of, neutrinos, are, the, electron, muon, and, tau, neutrinos, oscillate, among, the, flavours, as, they, move, it, is, hard, to, determine, an, exact, upper, bound, on, the, collective, average, mass, of, the, three, neutrinos, for, example, if, the, average, neutrino, mass, were, over, 50, ev, c, 2, less, than, 10, 5, of, the, mass, of, an, electron, the, universe, would, collapse, cmb, data, and, other, methods, indicate, that, their, average, mass, probably, does, not, exceed, 0, 3, ev, c, 2, thus, observed, neutrinos, cannot, explain, dark, matter, because, galaxy, size, density, fluctuations, get, washed, out, by, free, streaming, hot, dark, matter, implies, the, first, objects, that, can, form, are, huge, supercluster, size, pancakes, which, then, fragment, into, galaxies, deep, field, observations, show, instead, that, galaxies, formed, first, followed, by, clusters, and, superclusters, as, galaxies, clump, together, if, dark, matter, is, composed, of, weakly, interacting, particles, then, an, obvious, question, is, whether, it, can, form, objects, equivalent, to, planets, stars, or, black, holes, historically, the, answer, has, been, it, cannot, because, of, two, factors, however, there, are, theories, of, atomic, dark, matter, similar, to, normal, matter, that, overcome, these, problems, if, dark, matter, is, made, up, of, subatomic, particles, then, millions, possibly, billions, of, such, particles, must, pass, through, every, square, centimeter, of, the, earth, each, second, many, experiments, aim, to, test, this, hypothesis, although, wimps, have, been, the, main, search, candidates, axions, have, drawn, renewed, attention, with, the, axion, dark, matter, experiment, admx, searches, for, axions, and, many, more, planned, in, the, future, another, candidate, is, heavy, hidden, sector, particles, which, only, interact, with, ordinary, matter, via, gravity, these, experiments, can, be, divided, into, two, classes, direct, detection, experiments, which, search, for, the, scattering, of, dark, matter, particles, off, atomic, nuclei, within, a, detector, and, indirect, detection, which, look, for, the, products, of, dark, matter, particle, annihilations, or, decays, direct, detection, experiments, aim, to, observe, low, energy, recoils, typically, a, few, kevs, of, nuclei, induced, by, interactions, with, particles, of, dark, matter, which, in, theory, are, passing, through, the, earth, after, such, a, recoil, the, nucleus, will, emit, energy, in, the, form, of, scintillation, light, or, phonons, as, they, pass, through, sensitive, detection, apparatus, to, do, so, effectively, it, is, crucial, to, maintain, an, extremely, low, background, which, is, the, reason, why, such, experiments, typically, operate, deep, underground, where, interference, from, cosmic, rays, is, minimized, examples, of, underground, laboratories, with, direct, detection, experiments, include, the, stawell, mine, the, soudan, mine, the, snolab, underground, laboratory, at, sudbury, the, gran, sasso, national, laboratory, the, canfranc, underground, laboratory, the, boulby, underground, laboratory, the, deep, underground, science, and, engineering, laboratory, and, the, china, jinping, underground, laboratory, these, experiments, mostly, use, either, cryogenic, or, noble, liquid, detector, technologies, cryogenic, detectors, operating, at, temperatures, below, 100, mk, detect, the, heat, produced, when, a, particle, hits, an, atom, in, a, crystal, absorber, such, as, germanium, noble, liquid, detectors, detect, scintillation, produced, by, a, particle, collision, in, liquid, xenon, or, argon, cryogenic, detector, experiments, include, such, projects, as, cdms, cresst, edelweiss, and, eureca, while, noble, liquid, experiments, include, lz, xenon, deap, ardm, warp, darkside, pandax, and, lux, the, large, underground, xenon, experiment, both, of, these, techniques, focus, strongly, on, their, ability, to, distinguish, background, particles, which, predominantly, scatter, off, electrons, from, dark, matter, particles, that, scatter, off, nuclei, other, experiments, include, simple, and, picasso, which, use, alternative, methods, in, their, attempts, to, detect, dark, matter, currently, there, has, been, no, well, established, claim, of, dark, matter, detection, from, a, direct, detection, experiment, leading, instead, to, strong, upper, limits, on, the, mass, and, interaction, cross, section, with, nucleons, of, such, dark, matter, particles, the, dama, nai, and, more, recent, dama, libra, experimental, collaborations, have, detected, an, annual, modulation, in, the, rate, of, events, in, their, detectors, which, they, claim, is, due, to, dark, matter, this, results, from, the, expectation, that, as, the, earth, orbits, the, sun, the, velocity, of, the, detector, relative, to, the, dark, matter, halo, will, vary, by, a, small, amount, this, claim, is, so, far, unconfirmed, and, in, contradiction, with, negative, results, from, other, experiments, such, as, lux, supercdms, and, xenon100, a, special, case, of, direct, detection, experiments, covers, those, with, directional, sensitivity, this, is, a, search, strategy, based, on, the, motion, of, the, solar, system, around, the, galactic, center, a, low, pressure, time, projection, chamber, makes, it, possible, to, access, information, on, recoiling, tracks, and, constrain, wimp, nucleus, kinematics, wimps, coming, from, the, direction, in, which, the, sun, travels, approximately, towards, cygnus, may, then, be, separated, from, background, which, should, be, isotropic, directional, dark, matter, experiments, include, dmtpc, drift, newage, and, mimac, indirect, detection, experiments, search, for, the, products, of, the, self, annihilation, or, decay, of, dark, matter, particles, in, outer, space, for, example, in, regions, of, high, dark, matter, density, e, g, the, centre, of, our, galaxy, two, dark, matter, particles, could, annihilate, to, produce, gamma, rays, or, standard, model, particle, antiparticle, pairs, alternatively, if, a, dark, matter, particle, is, unstable, it, could, decay, into, standard, model, or, other, particles, these, processes, could, be, detected, indirectly, through, an, excess, of, gamma, rays, antiprotons, or, positrons, emanating, from, high, density, regions, in, our, galaxy, or, others, a, major, difficulty, inherent, in, such, searches, is, that, various, astrophysical, sources, can, mimic, the, signal, expected, from, dark, matter, and, so, multiple, signals, are, likely, required, for, a, conclusive, discovery, a, few, of, the, dark, matter, particles, passing, through, the, sun, or, earth, may, scatter, off, atoms, and, lose, energy, thus, dark, matter, may, accumulate, at, the, center, of, these, bodies, increasing, the, chance, of, collision, annihilation, this, could, produce, a, distinctive, signal, in, the, form, of, high, energy, neutrinos, such, a, signal, would, be, strong, indirect, proof, of, wimp, dark, matter, high, energy, neutrino, telescopes, such, as, amanda, icecube, and, antares, are, searching, for, this, signal, 298, the, detection, by, ligo, in, september, 2015, of, gravitational, waves, opens, the, possibility, of, observing, dark, matter, in, a, new, way, particularly, if, it, is, in, the, form, of, primordial, black, holes, many, experimental, searches, have, been, undertaken, to, look, for, such, emission, from, dark, matter, annihilation, or, decay, examples, of, which, follow, the, energetic, gamma, ray, experiment, telescope, observed, more, gamma, rays, in, 2008, than, expected, from, the, milky, way, but, scientists, concluded, this, was, most, likely, due, to, incorrect, estimation, of, the, telescope, s, sensitivity, the, fermi, gamma, ray, space, telescope, is, searching, for, similar, gamma, rays, in, 2009, an, as, yet, unexplained, surplus, of, gamma, rays, from, the, milky, way, s, galactic, center, was, found, in, fermi, data, this, galactic, center, gev, excess, might, be, due, to, dark, matter, annihilation, or, to, a, population, of, pulsars, in, april, 2012, an, analysis, of, previously, available, data, from, fermi, s, large, area, telescope, instrument, produced, statistical, evidence, of, a, 130, gev, signal, in, the, gamma, radiation, coming, from, the, center, of, the, milky, way, wimp, annihilation, was, seen, as, the, most, probable, explanation, at, higher, energies, ground, based, gamma, ray, telescopes, have, set, limits, on, the, annihilation, of, dark, matter, in, dwarf, spheroidal, galaxies, and, in, clusters, of, galaxies, the, pamela, experiment, launched, in, 2006, detected, excess, positrons, they, could, be, from, dark, matter, annihilation, or, from, pulsars, no, excess, antiprotons, were, observed, in, 2013, results, from, the, alpha, magnetic, spectrometer, on, the, international, space, station, indicated, excess, high, energy, cosmic, rays, which, could, be, due, to, dark, matter, annihilation, an, alternative, approach, to, the, detection, of, dark, matter, particles, in, nature, is, to, produce, them, in, a, laboratory, experiments, with, the, large, hadron, collider, lhc, may, be, able, to, detect, dark, matter, particles, produced, in, collisions, of, the, lhc, proton, beams, because, a, dark, matter, particle, should, have, negligible, interactions, with, normal, visible, matter, it, may, be, detected, indirectly, as, large, amounts, of, missing, energy, and, momentum, that, escape, the, detectors, provided, other, non, negligible, collision, products, are, detected, constraints, on, dark, matter, also, exist, from, the, lep, experiment, using, a, similar, principle, but, probing, the, interaction, of, dark, matter, particles, with, electrons, rather, than, quarks, any, discovery, from, collider, searches, must, be, corroborated, by, discoveries, in, the, indirect, or, direct, detection, sectors, to, prove, that, the, particle, discovered, is, in, fact, dark, matter, because, dark, matter, has, not, yet, been, identified, many, other, hypotheses, have, emerged, aiming, to, explain, the, same, observational, phenomena, without, introducing, a, new, unknown, type, of, matter, the, theory, underpinning, most, observational, evidence, for, dark, matter, general, relativity, is, well, tested, on, solar, system, scales, but, its, validity, on, galactic, or, cosmological, scales, has, not, been, well, proven, a, suitable, modification, to, general, relativity, can, in, principle, conceivably, eliminate, the, need, for, dark, matter, the, best, known, theories, of, this, class, are, mond, and, its, relativistic, generalization, tensor, vector, scalar, gravity, teves, f, r, gravity, negative, mass, dark, fluid, and, entropic, gravity, alternative, theories, abound, primordial, black, holes, are, considered, candidates, for, components, of, dark, matter, early, constraints, on, primordial, black, holes, as, dark, matter, usually, assumed, most, black, holes, would, have, similar, or, identical, monochromatic, mass, which, was, disproven, by, ligo, virgo, results, in, 2024, a, review, by, bernard, carr, and, colleagues, concluded, that, primordial, black, holes, forming, in, the, quantum, chromodynamics, epoch, prior, to, 10, 5, seconds, after, the, big, bang, can, explain, most, observations, attributed, to, dark, matter, such, black, hole, formation, would, result, in, an, extended, mass, distribution, today, with, a, number, of, distinct, bumps, the, most, prominent, one, being, at, around, one, solar, mass, a, problem, with, alternative, hypotheses, is, that, observational, evidence, for, dark, matter, comes, from, so, many, independent, approaches, see, the, observational, evidence, section, above, explaining, any, individual, observation, is, possible, but, explaining, all, of, them, in, the, absence, of, dark, matter, is, very, difficult, nonetheless, there, have, been, some, scattered, successes, for, alternative, hypotheses, such, as, a, 2016, test, of, gravitational, lensing, in, entropic, gravity, and, a, 2020, measurement, of, a, unique, mond, effect, the, prevailing, opinion, among, most, astrophysicists, is, that, while, modifications, to, general, relativity, can, conceivably, explain, part, of, the, observational, evidence, there, is, probably, enough, data, to, conclude, there, must, be, some, form, of, dark, matter, present, in, the, universe, dark, matter, regularly, appears, as, a, topic, in, hybrid, periodicals, that, cover, both, factual, scientific, topics, and, science, fiction, and, dark, matter, itself, has, been, referred, to, as, the, stuff, of, science, fiction, mention, of, dark, matter, is, made, in, works, of, fiction, in, such, cases, it, is, usually, attributed, extraordinary, physical, or, magical, properties, thus, becoming, inconsistent, with, the, hypothesized, properties, of, dark, matter, in, physics, and, cosmology, for, example, more, broadly, the, phrase, dark, matter, is, used, metaphorically, in, fiction, to, evoke, the, unseen, or, invisible
