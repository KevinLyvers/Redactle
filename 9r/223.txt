there, is, evidence, that, the, formation, of, the, solar, system, began, about, 4, 6, billion, years, ago, with, the, gravitational, collapse, of, a, small, part, of, a, giant, molecular, cloud, most, of, the, collapsing, mass, collected, in, the, center, forming, the, sun, while, the, rest, flattened, into, a, protoplanetary, disk, out, of, which, the, planets, moons, asteroids, and, other, small, solar, system, bodies, formed, this, model, known, as, the, nebular, hypothesis, was, first, developed, in, the, 18th, century, by, emanuel, swedenborg, immanuel, kant, and, pierre, simon, laplace, its, subsequent, development, has, interwoven, a, variety, of, scientific, disciplines, including, astronomy, chemistry, geology, physics, and, planetary, science, since, the, dawn, of, the, space, age, in, the, 1950s, and, the, discovery, of, exoplanets, in, the, 1990s, the, model, has, been, both, challenged, and, refined, to, account, for, new, observations, the, solar, system, has, evolved, considerably, since, its, initial, formation, many, moons, have, formed, from, circling, discs, of, gas, and, dust, around, their, parent, planets, while, other, moons, are, thought, to, have, formed, independently, and, later, to, have, been, captured, by, their, planets, still, others, such, as, earth, s, moon, may, be, the, result, of, giant, collisions, collisions, between, bodies, have, occurred, continually, up, to, the, present, day, and, have, been, central, to, the, evolution, of, the, solar, system, beyond, neptune, many, sub, planet, sized, objects, formed, several, thousand, trans, neptunian, objects, have, been, observed, unlike, the, planets, these, trans, neptunian, objects, mostly, move, on, eccentric, orbits, inclined, to, the, plane, of, the, planets, the, positions, of, the, planets, might, have, shifted, due, to, gravitational, interactions, planetary, migration, may, have, been, responsible, for, much, of, the, solar, system, s, early, evolution, in, roughly, 5, billion, years, the, sun, will, cool, and, expand, outward, to, many, times, its, current, diameter, becoming, a, red, giant, before, casting, off, its, outer, layers, as, a, planetary, nebula, and, leaving, behind, a, stellar, remnant, known, as, a, white, dwarf, in, the, distant, future, the, gravity, of, passing, stars, will, gradually, reduce, the, sun, s, retinue, of, planets, some, planets, will, be, destroyed, and, others, ejected, into, interstellar, space, ultimately, over, the, course, of, tens, of, billions, of, years, it, is, likely, that, the, sun, will, be, left, with, none, of, the, original, bodies, in, orbit, around, it, ideas, concerning, the, origin, and, fate, of, the, world, date, from, the, earliest, known, writings, however, for, almost, all, of, that, time, there, was, no, attempt, to, link, such, theories, to, the, existence, of, a, solar, system, simply, because, it, was, not, generally, thought, that, the, solar, system, in, the, sense, we, now, understand, it, existed, the, first, step, toward, a, theory, of, solar, system, formation, and, evolution, was, the, general, acceptance, of, heliocentrism, which, placed, the, sun, at, the, centre, of, the, system, and, the, earth, in, orbit, around, it, this, concept, had, been, developed, for, millennia, aristarchus, of, samos, had, suggested, it, as, early, as, 250, bc, but, was, not, widely, accepted, until, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, the, first, recorded, use, of, the, term, solar, system, dates, from, 1704, the, current, standard, theory, for, solar, system, formation, the, nebular, hypothesis, has, fallen, into, and, out, of, favour, since, its, formulation, by, emanuel, swedenborg, immanuel, kant, and, pierre, simon, laplace, in, the, 18th, century, the, most, significant, criticism, of, the, hypothesis, was, its, apparent, inability, to, explain, the, sun, s, relative, lack, of, angular, momentum, when, compared, to, the, planets, however, since, the, early, 1980s, studies, of, young, stars, have, shown, them, to, be, surrounded, by, cool, discs, of, dust, and, gas, exactly, as, the, nebular, hypothesis, predicts, which, has, led, to, its, re, acceptance, understanding, of, how, the, sun, is, expected, to, continue, to, evolve, required, an, understanding, of, the, source, of, its, power, arthur, stanley, eddington, s, confirmation, of, albert, einstein, s, theory, of, relativity, led, to, his, realisation, that, the, sun, s, energy, comes, from, nuclear, fusion, reactions, in, its, core, fusing, hydrogen, into, helium, in, 1935, eddington, went, further, and, suggested, that, other, elements, also, might, form, within, stars, fred, hoyle, elaborated, on, this, premise, by, arguing, that, evolved, stars, called, red, giants, created, many, elements, heavier, than, hydrogen, and, helium, in, their, cores, when, a, red, giant, finally, casts, off, its, outer, layers, these, elements, would, then, be, recycled, to, form, other, star, systems, the, nebular, hypothesis, says, that, the, solar, system, formed, from, the, gravitational, collapse, of, a, fragment, of, a, giant, molecular, cloud, most, likely, at, the, edge, of, a, wolf, rayet, bubble, the, cloud, was, about, 20, parsecs, 65, light, years, across, while, the, fragments, were, roughly, 1, parsec, three, and, a, quarter, light, years, across, the, further, collapse, of, the, fragments, led, to, the, formation, of, dense, cores, 0, 01, 0, 1, parsec, 2, 000, 20, 000, au, in, size, one, of, these, collapsing, fragments, known, as, the, presolar, nebula, formed, what, became, the, solar, system, the, composition, of, this, region, with, a, mass, just, over, that, of, the, sun, m, was, about, the, same, as, that, of, the, sun, today, with, hydrogen, along, with, helium, and, trace, amounts, of, lithium, produced, by, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, forming, about, 98, of, its, mass, the, remaining, 2, of, the, mass, consisted, of, heavier, elements, that, were, created, by, nucleosynthesis, in, earlier, generations, of, stars, late, in, the, life, of, these, stars, they, ejected, heavier, elements, into, the, interstellar, medium, some, scientists, have, given, the, name, coatlicue, to, a, hypothetical, star, that, went, supernova, and, created, the, presolar, nebula, the, oldest, inclusions, found, in, meteorites, thought, to, trace, the, first, solid, material, to, form, in, the, presolar, nebula, are, 4, 568, 2, million, years, old, which, is, one, definition, of, the, age, of, the, solar, system, studies, of, ancient, meteorites, reveal, traces, of, stable, daughter, nuclei, of, short, lived, isotopes, such, as, iron, 60, that, only, form, in, exploding, short, lived, stars, this, indicates, that, one, or, more, supernovae, occurred, nearby, a, shock, wave, from, a, supernova, may, have, triggered, the, formation, of, the, sun, by, creating, relatively, dense, regions, within, the, cloud, causing, these, regions, to, collapse, the, highly, homogeneous, distribution, of, iron, 60, in, the, solar, system, points, to, the, occurrence, of, this, supernova, and, its, injection, of, iron, 60, being, well, before, the, accretion, of, nebular, dust, into, planetary, bodies, because, only, massive, short, lived, stars, produce, supernovae, the, sun, must, have, formed, in, a, large, star, forming, region, that, produced, massive, stars, possibly, similar, to, the, orion, nebula, studies, of, the, structure, of, the, kuiper, belt, and, of, anomalous, materials, within, it, suggest, that, the, sun, formed, within, a, cluster, of, between, 1, 000, and, 10, 000, stars, with, a, diameter, of, between, 6, 5, and, 19, 5, light, years, and, a, collective, mass, of, 3, 000, m, this, cluster, began, to, break, apart, between, 135, million, and, 535, million, years, after, formation, several, simulations, of, our, young, sun, interacting, with, close, passing, stars, over, the, first, 100, million, years, of, its, life, produced, anomalous, orbits, observed, in, the, outer, solar, system, such, as, detached, objects, a, recent, study, suggests, that, such, a, passing, star, is, not, only, responsible, for, the, orbits, of, the, detached, objects, but, also, the, hot, and, cold, kuiper, belt, population, the, sedna, like, objects, the, extreme, tno, s, and, the, retrograde, tno, s, because, of, the, conservation, of, angular, momentum, the, nebula, spun, faster, as, it, collapsed, as, the, material, within, the, nebula, condensed, the, temperature, rose, the, center, where, most, of, the, mass, collected, became, increasingly, hotter, than, the, surrounding, disc, over, about, 100, 000, years, the, competing, forces, of, gravity, gas, pressure, magnetic, fields, and, rotation, caused, the, contracting, nebula, to, flatten, into, a, spinning, protoplanetary, disc, with, a, diameter, of, about, 200, au, and, form, a, hot, dense, protostar, a, star, in, which, hydrogen, fusion, has, not, yet, begun, at, the, centre, since, about, half, of, all, known, stars, form, systems, of, multiple, stars, and, because, jupiter, is, made, of, the, same, elements, as, the, sun, hydrogen, and, helium, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, solar, system, might, have, been, early, in, its, formation, a, protostar, system, with, jupiter, being, the, second, but, failed, protostar, but, jupiter, has, far, too, little, mass, to, trigger, fusion, in, its, core, and, so, became, a, gas, giant, it, is, in, fact, younger, than, the, sun, and, the, oldest, planet, of, the, solar, system, at, this, point, in, the, sun, s, evolution, the, sun, is, thought, to, have, been, a, t, tauri, star, studies, of, t, tauri, stars, show, that, they, are, often, accompanied, by, discs, of, pre, planetary, matter, with, masses, of, 0, 001, 0, 1, m, these, discs, extend, to, several, hundred, au, the, hubble, space, telescope, has, observed, protoplanetary, discs, of, up, to, 1000, au, in, diameter, in, star, forming, regions, such, as, the, orion, nebula, and, are, rather, cool, reaching, a, surface, temperature, of, only, about, 1, 000, k, 730, c, 1, 340, f, at, their, hottest, within, 50, million, years, the, temperature, and, pressure, at, the, core, of, the, sun, became, so, great, that, its, hydrogen, began, to, fuse, creating, an, internal, source, of, energy, that, countered, gravitational, contraction, until, hydrostatic, equilibrium, was, achieved, this, marked, the, sun, s, entry, into, the, prime, phase, of, its, life, known, as, the, main, sequence, main, sequence, stars, derive, energy, from, the, fusion, of, hydrogen, into, helium, in, their, cores, the, sun, remains, a, main, sequence, star, today, as, the, early, solar, system, continued, to, evolve, it, eventually, drifted, away, from, its, siblings, in, the, stellar, nursery, and, continued, orbiting, the, milky, way, s, center, on, its, own, the, sun, likely, drifted, from, its, original, orbital, distance, from, the, center, of, the, galaxy, the, chemical, history, of, the, sun, suggests, it, may, have, formed, as, much, as, 3, kpc, closer, to, the, galaxy, core, like, most, stars, the, sun, likely, formed, not, in, isolation, but, as, part, of, a, young, star, cluster, there, are, several, indications, that, hint, at, the, cluster, environment, having, had, some, influence, over, the, young, still, forming, solar, system, for, example, the, decline, in, mass, beyond, neptune, and, the, extreme, eccentric, orbit, of, sedna, have, been, interpreted, as, a, signature, of, the, solar, system, having, been, influenced, by, its, birth, environment, whether, the, presence, of, the, isotopes, iron, 60, and, aluminium, 26, can, be, interpreted, as, a, sign, of, a, birth, cluster, containing, massive, stars, is, still, under, debate, if, the, sun, was, part, of, a, star, cluster, it, might, have, been, influenced, by, close, flybys, of, other, stars, the, strong, radiation, of, nearby, massive, stars, and, ejecta, from, supernovae, occurring, close, by, the, various, planets, are, thought, to, have, formed, from, the, solar, nebula, the, disc, shaped, cloud, of, gas, and, dust, left, over, from, the, sun, s, formation, the, currently, accepted, method, by, which, the, planets, formed, is, accretion, in, which, the, planets, began, as, dust, grains, in, orbit, around, the, central, protostar, through, direct, contact, and, self, organization, these, grains, formed, into, clumps, up, to, 200, m, 660, ft, in, diameter, which, in, turn, collided, to, form, larger, bodies, planetesimals, of, 10, km, 6, 2, mi, in, size, these, gradually, increased, through, further, collisions, growing, at, the, rate, of, centimetres, per, year, over, the, course, of, the, next, few, million, years, the, inner, solar, system, the, region, of, the, solar, system, inside, 4, au, was, too, warm, for, volatile, molecules, like, water, and, methane, to, condense, so, the, planetesimals, that, formed, there, could, only, form, from, compounds, with, high, melting, points, such, as, metals, like, iron, nickel, and, aluminium, and, rocky, silicates, these, rocky, bodies, would, become, the, terrestrial, planets, mercury, venus, earth, and, mars, these, compounds, are, quite, rare, in, the, universe, comprising, only, 0, 6, of, the, mass, of, the, nebula, so, the, terrestrial, planets, could, not, grow, very, large, the, terrestrial, embryos, grew, to, about, 0, 05, earth, masses, m, e, and, ceased, accumulating, matter, about, 100, 000, years, after, the, formation, of, the, sun, subsequent, collisions, and, mergers, between, these, planet, sized, bodies, allowed, terrestrial, planets, to, grow, to, their, present, sizes, when, terrestrial, planets, were, forming, they, remained, immersed, in, a, disk, of, gas, and, dust, pressure, partially, supported, the, gas, and, so, did, not, orbit, the, sun, as, rapidly, as, the, planets, the, resulting, drag, and, more, importantly, gravitational, interactions, with, the, surrounding, material, caused, a, transfer, of, angular, momentum, and, as, a, result, the, planets, gradually, migrated, to, new, orbits, models, show, that, density, and, temperature, variations, in, the, disk, governed, this, rate, of, migration, but, the, net, trend, was, for, the, inner, planets, to, migrate, inward, as, the, disk, dissipated, leaving, the, planets, in, their, current, orbits, the, giant, planets, jupiter, saturn, uranus, and, neptune, formed, further, out, beyond, the, frost, line, which, is, the, point, between, the, orbits, of, mars, and, jupiter, where, the, material, is, cool, enough, for, volatile, icy, compounds, to, remain, solid, the, ices, that, formed, the, jovian, planets, were, more, abundant, than, the, metals, and, silicates, that, formed, the, terrestrial, planets, allowing, the, giant, planets, to, grow, massive, enough, to, capture, hydrogen, and, helium, the, lightest, and, most, abundant, elements, planetesimals, beyond, the, frost, line, accumulated, up, to, 4, m, e, within, about, 3, million, years, today, the, four, giant, planets, comprise, just, under, 99, of, all, the, mass, orbiting, the, sun, theorists, believe, it, is, no, accident, that, jupiter, lies, just, beyond, the, frost, line, because, the, frost, line, accumulated, large, amounts, of, water, via, evaporation, from, infalling, icy, material, it, created, a, region, of, lower, pressure, that, increased, the, speed, of, orbiting, dust, particles, and, halted, their, motion, toward, the, sun, in, effect, the, frost, line, acted, as, a, barrier, that, caused, the, material, to, accumulate, rapidly, at, 5, au, from, the, sun, this, excess, material, coalesced, into, a, large, embryo, or, core, on, the, order, of, 10, m, e, which, began, to, accumulate, an, envelope, via, accretion, of, gas, from, the, surrounding, disc, at, an, ever, increasing, rate, once, the, envelope, mass, became, about, equal, to, the, solid, core, mass, growth, proceeded, very, rapidly, reaching, about, 150, earth, masses, 10, 5, years, thereafter, and, finally, topping, out, at, 318, m, e, saturn, may, owe, its, substantially, lower, mass, simply, to, having, formed, a, few, million, years, after, jupiter, when, there, was, less, gas, available, to, consume, t, tauri, stars, like, the, young, sun, have, far, stronger, stellar, winds, than, more, stable, older, stars, uranus, and, neptune, are, thought, to, have, formed, after, jupiter, and, saturn, did, when, the, strong, solar, wind, had, blown, away, much, of, the, disc, material, as, a, result, those, planets, accumulated, little, hydrogen, and, helium, not, more, than, 1, m, e, each, uranus, and, neptune, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, failed, cores, the, main, problem, with, formation, theories, for, these, planets, is, the, timescale, of, their, formation, at, the, current, locations, it, would, have, taken, millions, of, years, for, their, cores, to, accrete, this, means, that, uranus, and, neptune, may, have, formed, closer, to, the, sun, near, or, even, between, jupiter, and, saturn, later, migrating, or, being, ejected, outward, see, planetary, migration, below, motion, in, the, planetesimal, era, was, not, all, inward, toward, the, sun, the, stardust, sample, return, from, comet, wild, 2, has, suggested, that, materials, from, the, early, formation, of, the, solar, system, migrated, from, the, warmer, inner, solar, system, to, the, region, of, the, kuiper, belt, after, between, three, and, ten, million, years, the, young, sun, s, solar, wind, would, have, cleared, away, all, the, gas, and, dust, in, the, protoplanetary, disc, blowing, it, into, interstellar, space, thus, ending, the, growth, of, the, planets, the, planets, were, originally, thought, to, have, formed, in, or, near, their, current, orbits, this, has, been, questioned, during, the, last, 20, years, currently, many, planetary, scientists, think, that, the, solar, system, might, have, looked, very, different, after, its, initial, formation, several, objects, at, least, as, massive, as, mercury, may, have, been, present, in, the, inner, solar, system, the, outer, solar, system, may, have, been, much, more, compact, than, it, is, now, and, the, kuiper, belt, may, have, been, much, closer, to, the, sun, at, the, end, of, the, planetary, formation, epoch, the, inner, solar, system, was, populated, by, 50, 100, moon, to, mars, sized, protoplanets, further, growth, was, possible, only, because, these, bodies, collided, and, merged, which, took, less, than, 100, million, years, these, objects, would, have, gravitationally, interacted, with, one, another, tugging, at, each, other, s, orbits, until, they, collided, growing, larger, until, the, four, terrestrial, planets, we, know, today, took, shape, one, such, giant, collision, is, thought, to, have, formed, the, moon, see, moons, below, while, another, removed, the, outer, envelope, of, the, young, mercury, one, unresolved, issue, with, this, model, is, that, it, cannot, explain, how, the, initial, orbits, of, the, proto, terrestrial, planets, which, would, have, needed, to, be, highly, eccentric, in, order, to, collide, produced, the, remarkably, stable, and, nearly, circular, orbits, they, have, today, one, hypothesis, for, this, eccentricity, dumping, is, that, terrestrials, formed, in, a, disc, of, gas, still, not, expelled, by, the, sun, the, gravitational, drag, of, this, residual, gas, would, have, eventually, lowered, the, planets, energy, smoothing, out, their, orbits, however, such, gas, if, it, existed, would, have, prevented, the, terrestrial, planets, orbits, from, becoming, so, eccentric, in, the, first, place, another, hypothesis, is, that, gravitational, drag, occurred, not, between, the, planets, and, residual, gas, but, between, the, planets, and, the, remaining, small, bodies, as, the, large, bodies, moved, through, the, crowd, of, smaller, objects, the, smaller, objects, attracted, by, the, larger, planets, gravity, formed, a, region, of, higher, density, a, gravitational, wake, in, the, larger, objects, path, as, they, did, so, the, increased, gravity, of, the, wake, slowed, the, larger, objects, down, into, more, regular, orbits, the, outer, edge, of, the, terrestrial, region, between, 2, and, 4, au, from, the, sun, is, called, the, asteroid, belt, the, asteroid, belt, initially, contained, more, than, enough, matter, to, form, 2, 3, earth, like, planets, and, indeed, a, large, number, of, planetesimals, formed, there, as, with, the, terrestrials, planetesimals, in, this, region, later, coalesced, and, formed, 20, 30, moon, to, mars, sized, planetary, embryos, however, the, proximity, of, jupiter, meant, that, after, this, planet, formed, 3, million, years, after, the, sun, the, region, s, history, changed, dramatically, orbital, resonances, with, jupiter, and, saturn, are, particularly, strong, in, the, asteroid, belt, and, gravitational, interactions, with, more, massive, embryos, scattered, many, planetesimals, into, those, resonances, jupiter, s, gravity, increased, the, velocity, of, objects, within, these, resonances, causing, them, to, shatter, upon, collision, with, other, bodies, rather, than, accrete, as, jupiter, migrated, inward, following, its, formation, see, planetary, migration, below, resonances, would, have, swept, across, the, asteroid, belt, dynamically, exciting, the, region, s, population, and, increasing, their, velocities, relative, to, each, other, the, cumulative, action, of, the, resonances, and, the, embryos, either, scattered, the, planetesimals, away, from, the, asteroid, belt, or, excited, their, orbital, inclinations, and, eccentricities, some, of, those, massive, embryos, too, were, ejected, by, jupiter, while, others, may, have, migrated, to, the, inner, solar, system, and, played, a, role, in, the, final, accretion, of, the, terrestrial, planets, during, this, primary, depletion, period, the, effects, of, the, giant, planets, and, planetary, embryos, left, the, asteroid, belt, with, a, total, mass, equivalent, to, less, than, 1, that, of, the, earth, composed, mainly, of, small, planetesimals, this, is, still, 10, 20, times, more, than, the, current, mass, in, the, main, belt, which, is, now, about, 0, 0005, m, e, a, secondary, depletion, period, that, brought, the, asteroid, belt, down, close, to, its, present, mass, is, thought, to, have, followed, when, jupiter, and, saturn, entered, a, temporary, 2, 1, orbital, resonance, see, below, the, inner, solar, system, s, period, of, giant, impacts, probably, played, a, role, in, earth, acquiring, its, current, water, content, 6, 10, 21, kg, from, the, early, asteroid, belt, water, is, too, volatile, to, have, been, present, at, earth, s, formation, and, must, have, been, subsequently, delivered, from, outer, colder, parts, of, the, solar, system, the, water, was, probably, delivered, by, planetary, embryos, and, small, planetesimals, thrown, out, of, the, asteroid, belt, by, jupiter, a, population, of, main, belt, comets, discovered, in, 2006, has, also, been, suggested, as, a, possible, source, for, earth, s, water, in, contrast, comets, from, the, kuiper, belt, or, farther, regions, delivered, not, more, than, about, 6, of, earth, s, water, the, panspermia, hypothesis, holds, that, life, itself, may, have, been, deposited, on, earth, in, this, way, although, this, idea, is, not, widely, accepted, according, to, the, nebular, hypothesis, the, outer, two, planets, may, be, in, the, wrong, place, uranus, and, neptune, known, as, the, ice, giants, exist, in, a, region, where, the, reduced, density, of, the, solar, nebula, and, longer, orbital, times, render, their, formation, there, highly, implausible, the, two, are, instead, thought, to, have, formed, in, orbits, near, jupiter, and, saturn, known, as, the, gas, giants, where, more, material, was, available, and, to, have, migrated, outward, to, their, current, positions, over, hundreds, of, millions, of, years, the, migration, of, the, outer, planets, is, also, necessary, to, account, for, the, existence, and, properties, of, the, solar, system, s, outermost, regions, beyond, neptune, the, solar, system, continues, into, the, kuiper, belt, the, scattered, disc, and, the, oort, cloud, three, sparse, populations, of, small, icy, bodies, thought, to, be, the, points, of, origin, for, most, observed, comets, at, their, distance, from, the, sun, accretion, was, too, slow, to, allow, planets, to, form, before, the, solar, nebula, dispersed, and, thus, the, initial, disc, lacked, enough, mass, density, to, consolidate, into, a, planet, the, kuiper, belt, lies, between, 30, and, 55, au, from, the, sun, while, the, farther, scattered, disc, extends, to, over, 100, au, and, the, distant, oort, cloud, begins, at, about, 50, 000, au, originally, however, the, kuiper, belt, was, much, denser, and, closer, to, the, sun, with, an, outer, edge, at, approximately, 30, au, its, inner, edge, would, have, been, just, beyond, the, orbits, of, uranus, and, neptune, which, were, in, turn, far, closer, to, the, sun, when, they, formed, most, likely, in, the, range, of, 15, 20, au, and, in, 50, of, simulations, ended, up, in, opposite, locations, with, uranus, farther, from, the, sun, than, neptune, according, to, the, nice, model, after, the, formation, of, the, solar, system, the, orbits, of, all, the, giant, planets, continued, to, change, slowly, influenced, by, their, interaction, with, the, large, number, of, remaining, planetesimals, after, 500, 600, million, years, about, 4, billion, years, ago, jupiter, and, saturn, fell, into, a, 2, 1, resonance, saturn, orbited, the, sun, once, for, every, two, jupiter, orbits, this, resonance, created, a, gravitational, push, against, the, outer, planets, possibly, causing, neptune, to, surge, past, uranus, and, plough, into, the, ancient, kuiper, belt, the, planets, scattered, the, majority, of, the, small, icy, bodies, inwards, while, themselves, moving, outwards, these, planetesimals, then, scattered, off, the, next, planet, they, encountered, in, a, similar, manner, moving, the, planets, orbits, outwards, while, they, moved, inwards, this, process, continued, until, the, planetesimals, interacted, with, jupiter, whose, immense, gravity, sent, them, into, highly, elliptical, orbits, or, even, ejected, them, outright, from, the, solar, system, this, caused, jupiter, to, move, slightly, inward, those, objects, scattered, by, jupiter, into, highly, elliptical, orbits, formed, the, oort, cloud, those, objects, scattered, to, a, lesser, degree, by, the, migrating, neptune, formed, the, current, kuiper, belt, and, scattered, disc, this, scenario, explains, the, kuiper, belt, s, and, scattered, disc, s, present, low, mass, some, of, the, scattered, objects, including, pluto, became, gravitationally, tied, to, neptune, s, orbit, forcing, them, into, mean, motion, resonances, eventually, friction, within, the, planetesimal, disc, made, the, orbits, of, uranus, and, neptune, near, circular, again, in, contrast, to, the, outer, planets, the, inner, planets, are, not, thought, to, have, migrated, significantly, over, the, age, of, the, solar, system, because, their, orbits, have, remained, stable, following, the, period, of, giant, impacts, another, question, is, why, mars, came, out, so, small, compared, with, earth, a, study, by, southwest, research, institute, san, antonio, texas, published, june, 6, 2011, called, the, grand, tack, hypothesis, proposes, that, jupiter, had, migrated, inward, to, 1, 5, au, after, saturn, formed, migrated, inward, and, established, the, 2, 3, mean, motion, resonance, with, jupiter, the, study, assumes, that, both, planets, migrated, back, to, their, present, positions, jupiter, thus, would, have, consumed, much, of, the, material, that, would, have, created, a, bigger, mars, the, same, simulations, also, reproduce, the, characteristics, of, the, modern, asteroid, belt, with, dry, asteroids, and, water, rich, objects, similar, to, comets, however, it, is, unclear, whether, conditions, in, the, solar, nebula, would, have, allowed, jupiter, and, saturn, to, move, back, to, their, current, positions, and, according, to, current, estimates, this, possibility, appears, unlikely, moreover, alternative, explanations, for, the, small, mass, of, mars, exist, gravitational, disruption, from, the, outer, planets, migration, would, have, sent, large, numbers, of, asteroids, into, the, inner, solar, system, severely, depleting, the, original, belt, until, it, reached, today, s, extremely, low, mass, this, event, may, have, triggered, the, late, heavy, bombardment, that, is, hypothesised, to, have, occurred, approximately, 4, billion, years, ago, 500, 600, million, years, after, the, formation, of, the, solar, system, however, a, recent, re, appraisal, of, the, cosmo, chemical, constraints, indicates, that, there, was, likely, no, late, spike, terminal, cataclysm, in, the, bombardment, rate, if, it, occurred, this, period, of, heavy, bombardment, lasted, several, hundred, million, years, and, is, evident, in, the, cratering, still, visible, on, geologically, dead, bodies, of, the, inner, solar, system, such, as, the, moon, and, mercury, the, oldest, known, evidence, for, life, on, earth, dates, to, 3, 8, billion, years, ago, almost, immediately, after, the, end, of, the, late, heavy, bombardment, impacts, are, thought, to, be, a, regular, if, currently, infrequent, part, of, the, evolution, of, the, solar, system, that, they, continue, to, happen, is, evidenced, by, the, collision, of, comet, shoemaker, levy, 9, with, jupiter, in, 1994, the, 2009, jupiter, impact, event, the, tunguska, event, the, chelyabinsk, meteor, and, the, impact, that, created, meteor, crater, in, arizona, the, process, of, accretion, therefore, is, not, complete, and, may, still, pose, a, threat, to, life, on, earth, over, the, course, of, the, solar, system, s, evolution, comets, were, ejected, out, of, the, inner, solar, system, by, the, gravity, of, the, giant, planets, and, sent, thousands, of, au, outward, to, form, the, oort, cloud, a, spherical, outer, swarm, of, cometary, nuclei, at, the, farthest, extent, of, the, sun, s, gravitational, pull, eventually, after, about, 800, million, years, the, gravitational, disruption, caused, by, galactic, tides, passing, stars, and, giant, molecular, clouds, began, to, deplete, the, cloud, sending, comets, into, the, inner, solar, system, the, evolution, of, the, outer, solar, system, also, appears, to, have, been, influenced, by, space, weathering, from, the, solar, wind, micrometeorites, and, the, neutral, components, of, the, interstellar, medium, the, evolution, of, the, asteroid, belt, after, late, heavy, bombardment, was, mainly, governed, by, collisions, objects, with, large, mass, have, enough, gravity, to, retain, any, material, ejected, by, a, violent, collision, in, the, asteroid, belt, this, usually, is, not, the, case, as, a, result, many, larger, objects, have, been, broken, apart, and, sometimes, newer, objects, have, been, forged, from, the, remnants, in, less, violent, collisions, moons, around, some, asteroids, currently, can, only, be, explained, as, consolidations, of, material, flung, away, from, the, parent, object, without, enough, energy, to, entirely, escape, its, gravity, moons, have, come, to, exist, around, most, planets, and, many, other, solar, system, bodies, these, natural, satellites, originated, by, one, of, three, possible, mechanisms, jupiter, and, saturn, have, several, large, moons, such, as, io, europa, ganymede, and, titan, which, may, have, originated, from, discs, around, each, giant, planet, in, much, the, same, way, that, the, planets, formed, from, the, disc, around, the, sun, this, origin, is, indicated, by, the, large, sizes, of, the, moons, and, their, proximity, to, the, planet, these, attributes, are, impossible, to, achieve, via, capture, while, the, gaseous, nature, of, the, primaries, also, makes, formation, from, collision, debris, unlikely, the, outer, moons, of, the, giant, planets, tend, to, be, small, and, have, eccentric, orbits, with, arbitrary, inclinations, these, are, the, characteristics, expected, of, captured, bodies, most, such, moons, orbit, in, the, direction, opposite, to, the, rotation, of, their, primary, the, largest, irregular, moon, is, neptune, s, moon, triton, which, is, thought, to, be, a, captured, kuiper, belt, object, moons, of, solid, solar, system, bodies, have, been, created, by, both, collisions, and, capture, mars, s, two, small, moons, deimos, and, phobos, are, thought, to, be, captured, asteroids, the, earth, s, moon, is, thought, to, have, formed, as, a, result, of, a, single, large, head, on, collision, the, impacting, object, probably, had, a, mass, comparable, to, that, of, mars, and, the, impact, probably, occurred, near, the, end, of, the, period, of, giant, impacts, the, collision, kicked, into, orbit, some, of, the, impactor, s, mantle, which, then, coalesced, into, the, moon, the, impact, was, probably, the, last, in, a, series, of, mergers, that, formed, the, earth, it, has, been, further, hypothesized, that, the, mars, sized, object, may, have, formed, at, one, of, the, stable, earth, sun, lagrangian, points, either, l, 4, or, l, 5, and, drifted, from, its, position, the, moons, of, trans, neptunian, objects, pluto, charon, and, orcus, vanth, may, also, have, formed, by, means, of, a, large, collision, the, pluto, charon, orcus, vanth, and, earth, moon, systems, are, unusual, in, the, solar, system, in, that, the, satellite, s, mass, is, at, least, 1, that, of, the, larger, body, astronomers, estimate, that, the, current, state, of, the, solar, system, will, not, change, drastically, until, the, sun, has, fused, almost, all, the, hydrogen, fuel, in, its, core, into, helium, beginning, its, evolution, from, the, main, sequence, of, the, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, and, into, its, red, giant, phase, the, solar, system, will, continue, to, evolve, until, then, eventually, the, sun, will, likely, expand, sufficiently, to, overwhelm, the, inner, planets, mercury, venus, and, possibly, earth, but, not, the, outer, planets, including, jupiter, and, saturn, afterward, the, sun, would, be, reduced, to, the, size, of, a, white, dwarf, and, the, outer, planets, and, their, moons, would, continue, orbiting, this, diminutive, solar, remnant, this, future, development, may, be, similar, to, the, observed, detection, of, moa, 2010, blg, 477l, b, a, jupiter, sized, exoplanet, orbiting, its, host, white, dwarf, star, moa, 2010, blg, 477l, the, solar, system, is, chaotic, over, million, and, billion, year, timescales, with, the, orbits, of, the, planets, open, to, long, term, variations, one, notable, example, of, this, chaos, is, the, neptune, pluto, system, which, lies, in, a, 3, 2, orbital, resonance, although, the, resonance, itself, will, remain, stable, it, becomes, impossible, to, predict, the, position, of, pluto, with, any, degree, of, accuracy, more, than, 10, 20, million, years, the, lyapunov, time, into, the, future, another, example, is, earth, s, axial, tilt, which, due, to, friction, raised, within, earth, s, mantle, by, tidal, interactions, with, the, moon, see, below, is, incomputable, from, some, point, between, 1, 5, and, 4, 5, billion, years, from, now, the, outer, planets, orbits, are, chaotic, over, longer, timescales, with, a, lyapunov, time, in, the, range, of, 2, 230, million, years, in, all, cases, this, means, that, the, position, of, a, planet, along, its, orbit, ultimately, becomes, impossible, to, predict, with, any, certainty, so, for, example, the, timing, of, winter, and, summer, becomes, uncertain, still, in, some, cases, the, orbits, themselves, may, change, dramatically, such, chaos, manifests, most, strongly, as, changes, in, eccentricity, with, some, planets, orbits, becoming, significantly, more, or, less, elliptical, ultimately, the, solar, system, is, stable, in, that, none, of, the, planets, are, likely, to, collide, with, each, other, or, be, ejected, from, the, system, in, the, next, few, billion, years, beyond, this, within, five, billion, years, or, so, mars, s, eccentricity, may, grow, to, around, 0, 2, such, that, it, lies, on, an, earth, crossing, orbit, leading, to, a, potential, collision, in, the, same, timescale, mercury, s, eccentricity, may, grow, even, further, and, a, close, encounter, with, venus, could, theoretically, eject, it, from, the, solar, system, altogether, or, send, it, on, a, collision, course, with, venus, or, earth, this, could, happen, within, a, billion, years, according, to, numerical, simulations, in, which, mercury, s, orbit, is, perturbed, the, evolution, of, moon, systems, is, driven, by, tidal, forces, a, moon, will, raise, a, tidal, bulge, in, the, object, it, orbits, the, primary, due, to, the, differential, gravitational, force, across, diameter, of, the, primary, if, a, moon, is, revolving, in, the, same, direction, as, the, planet, s, rotation, and, the, planet, is, rotating, faster, than, the, orbital, period, of, the, moon, the, bulge, will, constantly, be, pulled, ahead, of, the, moon, in, this, situation, angular, momentum, is, transferred, from, the, rotation, of, the, primary, to, the, revolution, of, the, satellite, the, moon, gains, energy, and, gradually, spirals, outward, while, the, primary, rotates, more, slowly, over, time, the, earth, and, its, moon, are, one, example, of, this, configuration, today, the, moon, is, tidally, locked, to, the, earth, one, of, its, revolutions, around, the, earth, currently, about, 29, days, is, equal, to, one, of, its, rotations, about, its, axis, so, it, always, shows, one, face, to, the, earth, the, moon, will, continue, to, recede, from, earth, and, earth, s, spin, will, continue, to, slow, gradually, other, examples, are, the, galilean, moons, of, jupiter, as, well, as, many, of, jupiter, s, smaller, moons, and, most, of, the, larger, moons, of, saturn, a, different, scenario, occurs, when, the, moon, is, either, revolving, around, the, primary, faster, than, the, primary, rotates, or, is, revolving, in, the, direction, opposite, the, planet, s, rotation, in, these, cases, the, tidal, bulge, lags, behind, the, moon, in, its, orbit, in, the, former, case, the, direction, of, angular, momentum, transfer, is, reversed, so, the, rotation, of, the, primary, speeds, up, while, the, satellite, s, orbit, shrinks, in, the, latter, case, the, angular, momentum, of, the, rotation, and, revolution, have, opposite, signs, so, transfer, leads, to, decreases, in, the, magnitude, of, each, that, cancel, each, other, out, in, both, cases, tidal, deceleration, causes, the, moon, to, spiral, in, towards, the, primary, until, it, either, is, torn, apart, by, tidal, stresses, potentially, creating, a, planetary, ring, system, or, crashes, into, the, planet, s, surface, or, atmosphere, such, a, fate, awaits, the, moons, phobos, of, mars, within, 30, to, 50, million, years, triton, of, neptune, in, 3, 6, billion, years, and, at, least, 16, small, satellites, of, uranus, and, neptune, uranus, s, desdemona, may, even, collide, with, one, of, its, neighboring, moons, a, third, possibility, is, where, the, primary, and, moon, are, tidally, locked, to, each, other, in, that, case, the, tidal, bulge, stays, directly, under, the, moon, there, is, no, angular, momentum, transfer, and, the, orbital, period, will, not, change, pluto, and, charon, are, an, example, of, this, type, of, configuration, there, is, no, consensus, on, the, mechanism, of, the, formation, of, the, rings, of, saturn, although, theoretical, models, indicated, that, the, rings, were, likely, to, have, formed, early, in, the, solar, system, s, history, data, from, the, cassini, huygens, spacecraft, suggests, they, formed, relatively, late, in, the, long, term, the, greatest, changes, in, the, solar, system, will, come, from, changes, in, the, sun, itself, as, it, ages, as, the, sun, burns, through, its, hydrogen, fuel, supply, it, gets, hotter, and, burns, the, remaining, fuel, even, faster, as, a, result, the, sun, is, growing, brighter, at, a, rate, of, ten, percent, every, 1, 1, billion, years, in, about, 600, million, years, the, sun, s, brightness, will, have, disrupted, the, earth, s, carbon, cycle, to, the, point, where, trees, and, forests, c3, photosynthetic, plant, life, will, no, longer, be, able, to, survive, and, in, around, 800, million, years, the, sun, will, have, killed, all, complex, life, on, the, earth, s, surface, and, in, the, oceans, in, 1, 1, billion, years, the, sun, s, increased, radiation, output, will, cause, its, circumstellar, habitable, zone, to, move, outwards, making, the, earth, s, surface, too, hot, for, liquid, water, to, exist, there, naturally, at, this, point, all, life, will, be, reduced, to, single, celled, organisms, evaporation, of, water, a, potent, greenhouse, gas, from, the, oceans, surface, could, accelerate, temperature, increase, potentially, ending, all, life, on, earth, even, sooner, during, this, time, it, is, possible, that, as, mars, s, surface, temperature, gradually, rises, carbon, dioxide, and, water, currently, frozen, under, the, surface, regolith, will, release, into, the, atmosphere, creating, a, greenhouse, effect, that, will, heat, the, planet, until, it, achieves, conditions, parallel, to, earth, today, providing, a, potential, future, abode, for, life, by, 3, 5, billion, years, from, now, earth, s, surface, conditions, will, be, similar, to, those, of, venus, today, around, 5, 4, billion, years, from, now, the, core, of, the, sun, will, become, hot, enough, to, trigger, hydrogen, fusion, in, its, surrounding, shell, this, will, cause, the, outer, layers, of, the, star, to, expand, greatly, and, the, star, will, enter, a, phase, of, its, life, in, which, it, is, called, a, red, giant, within, 7, 5, billion, years, the, sun, will, have, expanded, to, a, radius, of, 1, 2, au, 180, 10, 6, km, 110, 10, 6, mi, 256, times, its, current, size, at, the, tip, of, the, red, giant, branch, as, a, result, of, the, vastly, increased, surface, area, the, sun, s, surface, will, be, much, cooler, about, 2, 600, k, 2, 330, c, 4, 220, f, than, now, and, its, luminosity, much, higher, up, to, 2, 700, current, solar, luminosities, for, part, of, its, red, giant, life, the, sun, will, have, a, strong, stellar, wind, that, will, carry, away, around, 33, of, its, mass, during, these, times, it, is, possible, that, saturn, s, moon, titan, could, achieve, surface, temperatures, necessary, to, support, life, as, the, sun, expands, it, will, swallow, the, planets, mercury, and, venus, earth, s, fate, is, less, clear, although, the, sun, will, envelop, earth, s, current, orbit, the, star, s, loss, of, mass, and, thus, weaker, gravity, will, cause, the, planets, orbits, to, move, farther, out, if, it, were, only, for, this, venus, and, earth, would, probably, escape, incineration, but, a, 2008, study, suggests, that, earth, will, likely, be, swallowed, up, as, a, result, of, tidal, interactions, with, the, sun, s, weakly, bound, outer, envelope, additionally, the, sun, s, habitable, zone, will, move, into, the, outer, solar, system, and, eventually, beyond, the, kuiper, belt, at, the, end, of, the, red, giant, phase, causing, icy, bodies, such, as, enceladus, and, pluto, to, thaw, during, this, time, these, worlds, could, support, a, water, based, hydrologic, cycle, but, as, they, were, too, small, to, hold, a, dense, atmosphere, like, earth, they, would, experience, extreme, day, night, temperature, differences, when, the, sun, leaves, the, red, giant, branch, and, enters, the, asymptotic, giant, branch, the, habitable, zone, will, abruptly, shrink, to, roughly, the, space, between, jupiter, and, saturn, s, present, day, orbits, but, toward, the, end, of, the, 200, million, year, duration, of, the, asymptotic, giant, phase, it, will, expand, outward, to, about, the, same, distance, as, before, gradually, the, hydrogen, burning, in, the, shell, around, the, solar, core, will, increase, the, mass, of, the, core, until, it, reaches, about, 45, of, the, present, solar, mass, at, this, point, the, density, and, temperature, will, become, so, high, that, the, fusion, of, helium, into, carbon, will, begin, leading, to, a, helium, flash, the, sun, will, shrink, from, around, 250, to, 11, times, its, present, main, sequence, radius, consequently, its, luminosity, will, decrease, from, around, 3, 000, to, 54, times, its, current, level, and, its, surface, temperature, will, increase, to, about, 4, 770, k, 4, 500, c, 8, 130, f, the, sun, will, become, a, horizontal, giant, burning, helium, in, its, core, in, a, stable, fashion, much, like, it, burns, hydrogen, today, the, helium, fusing, stage, will, last, only, 100, million, years, eventually, it, will, have, to, again, resort, to, the, reserves, of, hydrogen, and, helium, in, its, outer, layers, it, will, expand, a, second, time, becoming, what, is, known, as, an, asymptotic, giant, here, the, luminosity, of, the, sun, will, increase, again, reaching, about, 2, 090, present, luminosities, and, it, will, cool, to, about, 3, 500, k, 3, 230, c, 5, 840, f, this, phase, lasts, about, 30, million, years, after, which, over, the, course, of, a, further, 100, 000, years, the, sun, s, remaining, outer, layers, will, fall, away, ejecting, a, vast, stream, of, matter, into, space, and, forming, a, halo, known, misleadingly, as, a, planetary, nebula, the, ejected, material, will, contain, the, helium, and, carbon, produced, by, the, sun, s, nuclear, reactions, continuing, the, enrichment, of, the, interstellar, medium, with, heavy, elements, for, future, generations, of, stars, and, planets, this, is, a, relatively, peaceful, event, nothing, akin, to, a, supernova, which, the, sun, is, too, small, to, undergo, as, part, of, its, evolution, any, observer, present, to, witness, this, occurrence, would, see, a, massive, increase, in, the, speed, of, the, solar, wind, but, not, enough, to, destroy, a, planet, completely, however, the, star, s, loss, of, mass, could, send, the, orbits, of, the, surviving, planets, into, chaos, causing, some, to, collide, others, to, be, ejected, from, the, solar, system, and, others, to, be, torn, apart, by, tidal, interactions, afterwards, all, that, will, remain, of, the, sun, is, a, white, dwarf, an, extraordinarily, dense, object, 54, of, its, original, mass, but, only, the, size, of, earth, initially, this, white, dwarf, may, be, 100, times, as, luminous, as, the, sun, is, now, it, will, consist, entirely, of, degenerate, carbon, and, oxygen, but, will, never, reach, temperatures, hot, enough, to, fuse, these, elements, thus, the, white, dwarf, sun, will, gradually, cool, growing, dimmer, and, dimmer, as, the, sun, dies, its, gravitational, pull, on, orbiting, bodies, such, as, planets, comets, and, asteroids, will, weaken, due, to, its, mass, loss, all, remaining, planets, orbits, will, expand, if, venus, earth, and, mars, still, exist, their, orbits, will, lie, roughly, at, 1, 4, au, 210, million, km, 130, million, mi, 1, 9, au, 280, million, km, 180, million, mi, and, 2, 8, au, 420, million, km, 260, million, mi, respectively, they, and, the, other, remaining, planets, will, become, dark, frigid, husks, completely, devoid, of, life, they, will, continue, to, orbit, their, star, their, speed, slowed, due, to, their, increased, distance, from, the, sun, and, the, sun, s, reduced, gravity, two, billion, years, later, when, the, sun, has, cooled, to, the, 6, 000, 8, 000, k, 5, 730, 7, 730, c, 10, 340, 13, 940, f, range, the, carbon, and, oxygen, in, the, sun, s, core, will, freeze, with, over, 90, of, its, remaining, mass, assuming, a, crystalline, structure, eventually, after, roughly, one, quadrillion, years, the, sun, will, finally, cease, to, shine, altogether, becoming, a, black, dwarf, the, solar, system, travels, alone, through, the, milky, way, in, a, circular, orbit, approximately, 30, 000, light, years, from, the, galactic, center, its, speed, is, about, 220, km, s, the, period, required, for, the, solar, system, to, complete, one, revolution, around, the, galactic, center, the, galactic, year, is, in, the, range, of, 220, 250, million, years, since, its, formation, the, solar, system, has, completed, at, least, 20, such, revolutions, various, scientists, have, speculated, that, the, solar, system, s, path, through, the, galaxy, is, a, factor, in, the, periodicity, of, mass, extinctions, observed, in, the, earth, s, fossil, record, one, hypothesis, supposes, that, vertical, oscillations, made, by, the, sun, as, it, orbits, the, galactic, centre, cause, it, to, regularly, pass, through, the, galactic, plane, when, the, sun, s, orbit, takes, it, outside, the, galactic, disc, the, influence, of, the, galactic, tide, is, weaker, as, it, re, enters, the, galactic, disc, as, it, does, every, 20, 25, million, years, it, comes, under, the, influence, of, the, far, stronger, disc, tides, which, according, to, mathematical, models, increase, the, flux, of, oort, cloud, comets, into, the, solar, system, by, a, factor, of, 4, leading, to, a, massive, increase, in, the, likelihood, of, a, devastating, impact, however, others, argue, that, the, sun, is, currently, close, to, the, galactic, plane, and, yet, the, last, great, extinction, event, was, 15, million, years, ago, therefore, the, sun, s, vertical, position, cannot, alone, explain, such, periodic, extinctions, and, that, extinctions, instead, occur, when, the, sun, passes, through, the, galaxy, s, spiral, arms, spiral, arms, are, home, not, only, to, larger, numbers, of, molecular, clouds, whose, gravity, may, distort, the, oort, cloud, but, also, to, higher, concentrations, of, bright, blue, giants, which, live, for, relatively, short, periods, and, then, explode, violently, as, supernovae, although, the, vast, majority, of, galaxies, in, the, universe, are, moving, away, from, the, milky, way, the, andromeda, galaxy, the, largest, member, of, the, local, group, of, galaxies, is, heading, toward, it, at, about, 120, km, s, in, 4, billion, years, andromeda, and, the, milky, way, will, collide, causing, both, to, deform, as, tidal, forces, distort, their, outer, arms, into, vast, tidal, tails, if, this, initial, disruption, occurs, astronomers, calculate, a, 12, chance, that, the, solar, system, will, be, pulled, outward, into, the, milky, way, s, tidal, tail, and, a, 3, chance, that, it, will, become, gravitationally, bound, to, andromeda, and, thus, a, part, of, that, galaxy, after, a, further, series, of, glancing, blows, during, which, the, likelihood, of, the, solar, system, s, ejection, rises, to, 30, the, galaxies, supermassive, black, holes, will, merge, eventually, in, roughly, 6, billion, years, the, milky, way, and, andromeda, will, complete, their, merger, into, a, giant, elliptical, galaxy, during, the, merger, if, there, is, enough, gas, the, increased, gravity, will, force, the, gas, to, the, centre, of, the, forming, elliptical, galaxy, this, may, lead, to, a, short, period, of, intensive, star, formation, called, a, starburst, in, addition, the, infalling, gas, will, feed, the, newly, formed, black, hole, transforming, it, into, an, active, galactic, nucleus, the, force, of, these, interactions, will, likely, push, the, solar, system, into, the, new, galaxy, s, outer, halo, leaving, it, relatively, unscathed, by, the, radiation, from, these, collisions, it, is, a, common, misconception, that, this, collision, will, disrupt, the, orbits, of, the, planets, in, the, solar, system, although, it, is, true, that, the, gravity, of, passing, stars, can, detach, planets, into, interstellar, space, distances, between, stars, are, so, great, that, the, likelihood, of, the, milky, way, andromeda, collision, causing, such, disruption, to, any, individual, star, system, is, negligible, although, the, solar, system, as, a, whole, could, be, affected, by, these, events, the, sun, and, planets, are, not, expected, to, be, disturbed, however, over, time, the, cumulative, probability, of, a, chance, encounter, with, a, star, increases, and, disruption, of, the, planets, becomes, all, but, inevitable, assuming, that, the, big, crunch, or, big, rip, scenarios, for, the, end, of, the, universe, do, not, occur, calculations, suggest, that, the, gravity, of, passing, stars, will, have, completely, stripped, the, dead, sun, of, its, remaining, planets, within, 1, quadrillion, 10, 15, years, this, point, marks, the, end, of, the, solar, system, although, the, sun, and, planets, may, survive, the, solar, system, in, any, meaningful, sense, will, cease, to, exist, the, time, frame, of, the, solar, system, s, formation, has, been, determined, using, radiometric, dating, scientists, estimate, that, the, solar, system, is, 4, 6, billion, years, old, the, oldest, known, mineral, grains, on, earth, are, approximately, 4, 4, billion, years, old, rocks, this, old, are, rare, as, earth, s, surface, is, constantly, being, reshaped, by, erosion, volcanism, and, plate, tectonics, to, estimate, the, age, of, the, solar, system, scientists, use, meteorites, which, were, formed, during, the, early, condensation, of, the, solar, nebula, almost, all, meteorites, see, the, canyon, diablo, meteorite, are, found, to, have, an, age, of, 4, 6, billion, years, suggesting, that, the, solar, system, must, be, at, least, this, old, studies, of, discs, around, other, stars, have, also, done, much, to, establish, a, time, frame, for, solar, system, formation, stars, between, one, and, three, million, years, old, have, discs, rich, in, gas, whereas, discs, around, stars, more, than, 10, million, years, old, have, little, to, no, gas, suggesting, that, giant, planets, within, them, have, ceased, forming, note, all, dates, and, times, in, this, chronology, are, approximate, and, should, be, taken, as, an, order, of, magnitude, indicator, only, solar, system, local, interstellar, cloud, local, bubble, gould, belt, orion, arm, milky, way,
