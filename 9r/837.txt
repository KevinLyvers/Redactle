in, atomic, physics, the, bohr, model, or, rutherford, bohr, model, was, the, first, successful, model, of, the, atom, developed, from, 1911, to, 1918, by, niels, bohr, and, building, on, ernest, rutherford, s, nuclear, model, it, supplanted, the, plum, pudding, model, of, j, j, thomson, only, to, be, replaced, by, the, quantum, atomic, model, in, the, 1920s, it, consists, of, a, small, dense, nucleus, surrounded, by, orbiting, electrons, it, is, analogous, to, the, structure, of, the, solar, system, but, with, attraction, provided, by, electrostatic, force, rather, than, gravity, and, with, the, electron, energies, quantized, assuming, only, discrete, values, in, the, history, of, atomic, physics, it, followed, and, ultimately, replaced, several, earlier, models, including, joseph, larmor, s, solar, system, model, 1897, jean, perrin, s, model, 1901, the, cubical, model, 1902, hantaro, nagaoka, s, saturnian, model, 1904, the, plum, pudding, model, 1904, arthur, haas, s, quantum, model, 1910, the, rutherford, model, 1911, and, john, william, nicholson, s, nuclear, quantum, model, 1912, the, improvement, over, the, 1911, rutherford, model, mainly, concerned, the, new, quantum, mechanical, interpretation, introduced, by, haas, and, nicholson, but, forsaking, any, attempt, to, explain, radiation, according, to, classical, physics, the, model, s, key, success, lies, in, explaining, the, rydberg, formula, for, hydrogen, s, spectral, emission, lines, while, the, rydberg, formula, had, been, known, experimentally, it, did, not, gain, a, theoretical, basis, until, the, bohr, model, was, introduced, not, only, did, the, bohr, model, explain, the, reasons, for, the, structure, of, the, rydberg, formula, it, also, provided, a, justification, for, the, fundamental, physical, constants, that, make, up, the, formula, s, empirical, results, the, bohr, model, is, a, relatively, primitive, model, of, the, hydrogen, atom, compared, to, the, valence, shell, model, as, a, theory, it, can, be, derived, as, a, first, order, approximation, of, the, hydrogen, atom, using, the, broader, and, much, more, accurate, quantum, mechanics, and, thus, may, be, considered, to, be, an, obsolete, scientific, theory, however, because, of, its, simplicity, and, its, correct, results, for, selected, systems, see, below, for, application, the, bohr, model, is, still, commonly, taught, to, introduce, students, to, quantum, mechanics, or, energy, level, diagrams, before, moving, on, to, the, more, accurate, but, more, complex, valence, shell, atom, a, related, quantum, model, was, proposed, by, arthur, erich, haas, in, 1910, but, was, rejected, until, the, 1911, solvay, congress, where, it, was, thoroughly, discussed, the, quantum, theory, of, the, period, between, planck, s, discovery, of, the, quantum, 1900, and, the, advent, of, a, mature, quantum, mechanics, 1925, is, often, referred, to, as, the, old, quantum, theory, until, the, second, decade, of, the, 20th, century, atomic, models, were, generally, speculative, and, even, the, concept, of, atoms, let, alone, atoms, with, internal, structure, faced, opposition, from, some, scientists, 2, when, bohr, began, his, work, on, a, new, atomic, theory, in, the, summer, of, 1912, 237, the, atomic, model, proposed, by, j, j, thomson, now, known, as, the, plum, pudding, model, was, the, best, available, 37, thomson, proposed, a, model, with, electrons, rotating, in, coplanar, rings, within, an, atomic, sized, positively, charged, spherical, volume, thomson, showed, that, this, model, was, mechanically, stable, by, lengthy, calculations, and, electrodynamically, stable, under, his, original, assumption, of, thousands, of, electrons, per, atom, moreover, he, suggested, that, the, particularly, stable, configurations, of, electrons, in, rings, was, connected, to, chemical, properties, of, the, atoms, and, he, developed, a, formula, for, the, scattering, of, beta, particles, that, seemed, to, match, experimental, results, 38, however, thomson, himself, later, showed, that, the, atom, had, a, factor, of, a, thousand, fewer, electrons, challenging, the, stability, argument, and, forcing, the, poorly, understood, positive, sphere, to, have, most, of, the, atom, s, mass, thomson, was, also, unable, to, explain, the, many, lines, in, atomic, spectra, 18, in, 1908, hans, geiger, and, ernest, marsden, demonstrated, that, alpha, particle, occasionally, scatter, at, large, angles, a, result, inconsistent, with, thomson, s, model, in, 1911, ernest, rutherford, developed, a, new, scattering, model, showing, that, the, observed, large, angle, scattering, could, be, explained, by, a, compact, highly, charged, mass, at, the, center, of, the, atom, rutherford, scattering, did, not, involved, the, electrons, and, thus, his, model, of, the, atom, was, incomplete, the, experiments, by, ernest, rutherford, established, that, atoms, consisted, a, small, dense, positively, charged, nucleus, attracting, negatively, charged, electrons, the, arrangement, of, the, electrons, was, unknown, some, suggestions, had, electrons, orbiting, a, solar, nucleus, but, involved, a, technical, difficulty, the, laws, of, classical, mechanics, i, e, the, larmor, formula, predict, that, the, electron, will, release, electromagnetic, radiation, while, orbiting, a, nucleus, because, the, electron, would, lose, energy, it, would, rapidly, spiral, inwards, collapsing, into, the, nucleus, on, a, timescale, of, around, 16, picoseconds, also, as, the, electron, spirals, inward, the, emission, would, rapidly, increase, in, frequency, due, to, the, orbital, period, becoming, shorter, resulting, in, electromagnetic, radiation, with, a, continuous, spectrum, however, late, 19th, century, experiments, with, electric, discharges, had, shown, that, atoms, will, only, emit, light, that, is, electromagnetic, radiation, at, certain, discrete, frequencies, by, the, early, twentieth, century, it, was, expected, that, the, atom, would, account, for, the, spectral, lines, in, 1897, lord, rayleigh, analyzed, the, problem, by, 1906, rayleigh, said, the, frequencies, observed, in, the, spectrum, may, not, be, frequencies, of, disturbance, or, of, oscillation, in, the, ordinary, sense, at, all, but, rather, form, an, essential, part, of, the, original, constitution, of, the, atom, as, determined, by, conditions, of, stability, the, outline, of, bohr, s, atom, came, during, the, proceedings, of, the, first, solvay, conference, in, 1911, on, the, subject, of, radiation, and, quanta, at, which, bohr, s, mentor, rutherford, was, present, max, planck, s, lecture, ended, with, this, remark, atoms, or, electrons, subject, to, the, molecular, bond, would, obey, the, laws, of, quantum, theory, hendrik, lorentz, in, the, discussion, of, planck, s, lecture, raised, the, question, of, the, composition, of, the, atom, based, on, thomson, s, model, with, the, quantum, modification, added, by, arthur, erich, haas, 273, lorentz, explained, that, the, planck, constant, could, be, taken, as, determining, the, size, of, atoms, or, that, the, size, of, atoms, could, be, taken, to, determine, the, planck, constant, lorentz, included, comments, regarding, the, emission, and, absorption, of, radiation, concluding, that, a, stationary, state, will, be, established, in, which, the, number, of, electrons, entering, their, spheres, is, equal, to, the, number, of, those, leaving, them, in, the, discussion, of, what, could, regulate, energy, differences, between, atoms, max, planck, simply, stated, the, intermediaries, could, be, the, electrons, the, discussions, outlined, the, need, for, the, quantum, theory, to, be, included, in, the, atom, and, the, difficulties, in, an, atomic, theory, planck, in, his, talk, said, explicitly, in, order, for, an, oscillator, to, be, able, to, provide, radiation, in, accordance, with, the, equation, it, is, necessary, to, introduce, into, the, laws, of, its, operation, as, we, have, already, said, at, the, beginning, of, this, report, a, particular, physical, hypothesis, which, is, on, a, fundamental, point, in, contradiction, with, classical, mechanics, explicitly, or, tacitly, bohr, s, first, paper, on, his, atomic, model, quotes, planck, almost, word, for, word, saying, whatever, the, alteration, in, the, laws, of, motion, of, the, electrons, may, be, it, seems, necessary, to, introduce, in, the, laws, in, question, a, quantity, foreign, to, the, classical, electrodynamics, i, e, the, planck, constant, or, as, it, often, is, called, the, elementary, quantum, of, action, bohr, s, footnote, at, the, bottom, of, the, page, is, to, the, french, translation, of, the, 1911, solvay, congress, proving, he, patterned, his, model, directly, on, the, proceedings, and, fundamental, principles, laid, down, by, planck, lorentz, and, the, quantized, haas, model, of, the, atom, which, was, mentioned, seventeen, times, lorentz, ended, the, discussion, of, einstein, s, talk, explaining, the, assumption, that, this, energy, must, be, a, multiple, of, h, displaystyle, h, nu, leads, to, the, following, formula, where, n, displaystyle, n, is, an, integer, q, v, 2, n, h, displaystyle, qv, 2, nh, nu, rutherford, could, have, outlined, these, points, to, bohr, or, given, him, a, copy, of, the, proceedings, since, he, quoted, from, them, and, used, them, as, a, reference, in, a, later, interview, bohr, said, it, was, very, interesting, to, hear, rutherford, s, remarks, about, the, solvay, congress, but, bohr, said, i, saw, the, actual, reports, of, the, solvay, congress, then, in, 1912, bohr, came, across, the, john, william, nicholson, theory, of, the, atom, model, that, quantized, angular, momentum, as, h, 2, displaystyle, h, 2, pi, according, to, a, centennial, celebration, of, the, bohr, atom, in, nature, magazine, it, was, nicholson, who, discovered, that, electrons, radiate, the, spectral, lines, as, they, descend, towards, the, nucleus, and, his, theory, was, both, nuclear, and, quantal, niels, bohr, quoted, him, in, his, 1913, paper, of, the, bohr, model, of, the, atom, the, importance, of, the, work, of, nicholson, s, nuclear, quantum, atomic, model, on, bohr, s, model, has, been, emphasized, by, many, historians, next, bohr, was, told, by, his, friend, hans, hansen, that, the, balmer, series, is, calculated, using, the, balmer, formula, an, empirical, equation, discovered, by, johann, balmer, in, 1885, that, described, wavelengths, of, some, spectral, lines, of, hydrogen, this, was, further, generalized, by, johannes, rydberg, in, 1888, resulting, in, what, is, now, known, as, the, rydberg, formula, after, this, bohr, declared, everything, became, clear, in, 1913, niels, bohr, put, forth, three, postulates, to, provide, an, electron, model, consistent, with, rutherford, s, nuclear, model, other, points, are, bohr, s, condition, that, the, angular, momentum, be, an, integer, multiple, of, displaystyle, hbar, was, later, reinterpreted, in, 1924, by, de, broglie, as, a, standing, wave, condition, the, electron, is, described, by, a, wave, and, a, whole, number, of, wavelengths, must, fit, along, the, circumference, of, the, electron, s, orbit, according, to, de, broglie, s, hypothesis, matter, particles, such, as, the, electron, behave, as, waves, the, de, broglie, wavelength, of, an, electron, is, which, implies, that, or, where, m, v, r, displaystyle, mvr, is, the, angular, momentum, of, the, orbiting, electron, writing, displaystyle, ell, for, this, angular, momentum, the, previous, equation, becomes, which, is, bohr, s, second, postulate, bohr, described, angular, momentum, of, the, electron, orbit, as, 2, h, displaystyle, 2, h, while, de, broglie, s, wavelength, of, h, p, displaystyle, lambda, h, p, described, h, displaystyle, h, divided, by, the, electron, momentum, in, 1913, however, bohr, justified, his, rule, by, appealing, to, the, correspondence, principle, without, providing, any, sort, of, wave, interpretation, in, 1913, the, wave, behavior, of, matter, particles, such, as, the, electron, was, not, suspected, in, 1925, a, new, kind, of, mechanics, was, proposed, quantum, mechanics, in, which, bohr, s, model, of, electrons, traveling, in, quantized, orbits, was, extended, into, a, more, accurate, model, of, electron, motion, the, new, theory, was, proposed, by, werner, heisenberg, another, form, of, the, same, theory, wave, mechanics, was, discovered, by, the, austrian, physicist, erwin, schr, dinger, independently, and, by, different, reasoning, schr, dinger, employed, de, broglie, s, matter, waves, but, sought, wave, solutions, of, a, three, dimensional, wave, equation, describing, electrons, that, were, constrained, to, move, about, the, nucleus, of, a, hydrogen, like, atom, by, being, trapped, by, the, potential, of, the, positive, nuclear, charge, the, bohr, model, gives, almost, exact, results, only, for, a, system, where, two, charged, points, orbit, each, other, at, speeds, much, less, than, that, of, light, this, not, only, involves, one, electron, systems, such, as, the, hydrogen, atom, singly, ionized, helium, and, doubly, ionized, lithium, but, it, includes, positronium, and, rydberg, states, of, any, atom, where, one, electron, is, far, away, from, everything, else, it, can, be, used, for, k, line, x, ray, transition, calculations, if, other, assumptions, are, added, see, moseley, s, law, below, in, high, energy, physics, it, can, be, used, to, calculate, the, masses, of, heavy, quark, mesons, calculation, of, the, orbits, requires, two, assumptions, if, an, electron, in, an, atom, is, moving, on, an, orbit, with, period, t, classically, the, electromagnetic, radiation, will, repeat, itself, every, orbital, period, if, the, coupling, to, the, electromagnetic, field, is, weak, so, that, the, orbit, doesn, t, decay, very, much, in, one, cycle, the, radiation, will, be, emitted, in, a, pattern, which, repeats, every, period, so, that, the, fourier, transform, will, have, frequencies, which, are, only, multiples, of, 1, t, however, in, the, quantum, realm, the, quantization, of, angular, momentum, leads, to, discrete, energy, levels, and, the, emitted, frequencies, are, quantized, according, to, the, energy, differences, between, these, levels, this, discrete, nature, of, energy, levels, introduces, a, fundamental, departure, from, the, classical, radiation, law, giving, rise, to, distinct, spectral, lines, in, the, emitted, radiation, in, quantum, mechanics, this, emission, must, be, in, quanta, of, light, of, frequencies, consisting, of, integer, multiples, of, 1, t, so, that, classical, mechanics, is, an, approximate, description, at, large, quantum, numbers, this, means, that, the, energy, level, corresponding, to, a, classical, orbit, of, period, 1, t, must, have, nearby, energy, levels, which, differ, in, energy, by, h, t, and, they, should, be, equally, spaced, near, that, level, bohr, worried, whether, the, energy, spacing, 1, t, should, be, best, calculated, with, the, period, of, the, energy, state, e, n, displaystyle, e, n, or, e, n, 1, displaystyle, e, n, 1, or, some, average, in, hindsight, this, model, is, only, the, leading, semiclassical, approximation, bohr, considered, circular, orbits, classically, these, orbits, must, decay, to, smaller, circles, when, photons, are, emitted, the, level, spacing, between, circular, orbits, can, be, calculated, with, the, correspondence, formula, for, a, hydrogen, atom, the, classical, orbits, have, a, period, t, determined, by, kepler, s, third, law, to, scale, as, r, 3, 2, the, energy, scales, as, 1, r, so, the, level, spacing, formula, amounts, to, it, is, possible, to, determine, the, energy, levels, by, recursively, stepping, down, orbit, by, orbit, but, there, is, a, shortcut, the, angular, momentum, l, of, the, circular, orbit, scales, as, r, displaystyle, sqrt, r, the, energy, in, terms, of, the, angular, momentum, is, then, assuming, with, bohr, that, quantized, values, of, l, are, equally, spaced, the, spacing, between, neighboring, energies, is, this, is, as, desired, for, equally, spaced, angular, momenta, if, one, kept, track, of, the, constants, the, spacing, would, be, so, the, angular, momentum, should, be, an, integer, multiple, of, this, is, how, bohr, arrived, at, his, model, an, electron, in, the, lowest, energy, level, of, hydrogen, n, 1, therefore, has, about, 13, 6, ev, less, energy, than, a, motionless, electron, infinitely, far, from, the, nucleus, the, next, energy, level, n, 2, is, 3, 4, ev, the, third, n, 3, is, 1, 51, ev, and, so, on, for, larger, values, of, n, these, are, also, the, binding, energies, of, a, highly, excited, atom, with, one, electron, in, a, large, circular, orbit, around, the, rest, of, the, atom, the, hydrogen, formula, also, coincides, with, the, wallis, product, the, combination, of, natural, constants, in, the, energy, formula, is, called, the, rydberg, energy, r, e, this, expression, is, clarified, by, interpreting, it, in, combinations, that, form, more, natural, units, since, this, derivation, is, with, the, assumption, that, the, nucleus, is, orbited, by, one, electron, we, can, generalize, this, result, by, letting, the, nucleus, have, a, charge, q, ze, where, z, is, the, atomic, number, this, will, now, give, us, energy, levels, for, hydrogenic, hydrogen, like, atoms, which, can, serve, as, a, rough, order, of, magnitude, approximation, of, the, actual, energy, levels, so, for, nuclei, with, z, protons, the, energy, levels, are, to, a, rough, approximation, the, actual, energy, levels, cannot, be, solved, analytically, for, more, than, one, electron, see, n, body, problem, because, the, electrons, are, not, only, affected, by, the, nucleus, but, also, interact, with, each, other, via, the, coulomb, force, when, z, 1, z, 137, the, motion, becomes, highly, relativistic, and, z, 2, cancels, the, 2, in, r, the, orbit, energy, begins, to, be, comparable, to, rest, energy, sufficiently, large, nuclei, if, they, were, stable, would, reduce, their, charge, by, creating, a, bound, electron, from, the, vacuum, ejecting, the, positron, to, infinity, this, is, the, theoretical, phenomenon, of, electromagnetic, charge, screening, which, predicts, a, maximum, nuclear, charge, emission, of, such, positrons, has, been, observed, in, the, collisions, of, heavy, ions, to, create, temporary, super, heavy, nuclei, the, bohr, formula, properly, uses, the, reduced, mass, of, electron, and, proton, in, all, situations, instead, of, the, mass, of, the, electron, however, these, numbers, are, very, nearly, the, same, due, to, the, much, larger, mass, of, the, proton, about, 1836, 1, times, the, mass, of, the, electron, so, that, the, reduced, mass, in, the, system, is, the, mass, of, the, electron, multiplied, by, the, constant, 1836, 1, 1, 1836, 1, 0, 99946, this, fact, was, historically, important, in, convincing, rutherford, of, the, importance, of, bohr, s, model, for, it, explained, the, fact, that, the, frequencies, of, lines, in, the, spectra, for, singly, ionized, helium, do, not, differ, from, those, of, hydrogen, by, a, factor, of, exactly, 4, but, rather, by, 4, times, the, ratio, of, the, reduced, mass, for, the, hydrogen, vs, the, helium, systems, which, was, much, closer, to, the, experimental, ratio, than, exactly, 4, for, positronium, the, formula, uses, the, reduced, mass, also, but, in, this, case, it, is, exactly, the, electron, mass, divided, by, 2, for, any, value, of, the, radius, the, electron, and, the, positron, are, each, moving, at, half, the, speed, around, their, common, center, of, mass, and, each, has, only, one, fourth, the, kinetic, energy, the, total, kinetic, energy, is, half, what, it, would, be, for, a, single, electron, moving, around, a, heavy, nucleus, the, rydberg, formula, which, was, known, empirically, before, bohr, s, formula, is, seen, in, bohr, s, theory, as, describing, the, energies, of, transitions, or, quantum, jumps, between, orbital, energy, levels, bohr, s, formula, gives, the, numerical, value, of, the, already, known, and, measured, the, rydberg, constant, but, in, terms, of, more, fundamental, constants, of, nature, including, the, electron, s, charge, and, the, planck, constant, when, the, electron, gets, moved, from, its, original, energy, level, to, a, higher, one, it, then, jumps, back, each, level, until, it, comes, to, the, original, position, which, results, in, a, photon, being, emitted, using, the, derived, formula, for, the, different, energy, levels, of, hydrogen, one, may, determine, the, wavelengths, of, light, that, a, hydrogen, atom, can, emit, the, energy, of, a, photon, emitted, by, a, hydrogen, atom, is, given, by, the, difference, of, two, hydrogen, energy, levels, where, n, f, is, the, final, energy, level, and, n, i, is, the, initial, energy, level, since, the, energy, of, a, photon, is, the, wavelength, of, the, photon, given, off, is, given, by, this, is, known, as, the, rydberg, formula, and, the, rydberg, constant, r, is, r, e, hc, or, r, e, 2, in, natural, units, this, formula, was, known, in, the, nineteenth, century, to, scientists, studying, spectroscopy, but, there, was, no, theoretical, explanation, for, this, form, or, a, theoretical, prediction, for, the, value, of, r, until, bohr, in, fact, bohr, s, derivation, of, the, rydberg, constant, as, well, as, the, concomitant, agreement, of, bohr, s, formula, with, experimentally, observed, spectral, lines, of, the, lyman, n, f, 1, balmer, n, f, 2, and, paschen, n, f, 3, series, and, successful, theoretical, prediction, of, other, lines, not, yet, observed, was, one, reason, that, his, model, was, immediately, accepted, to, apply, to, atoms, with, more, than, one, electron, the, rydberg, formula, can, be, modified, by, replacing, z, with, z, b, or, n, with, n, b, where, b, is, constant, representing, a, screening, effect, due, to, the, inner, shell, and, other, electrons, see, electron, shell, and, the, later, discussion, of, the, shell, model, of, the, atom, below, this, was, established, empirically, before, bohr, presented, his, model, bohr, s, original, three, papers, in, 1913, described, mainly, the, electron, configuration, in, lighter, elements, bohr, called, his, electron, shells, rings, in, 1913, atomic, orbitals, within, shells, did, not, exist, at, the, time, of, his, planetary, model, bohr, explains, in, part, 3, of, his, famous, 1913, paper, that, the, maximum, electrons, in, a, shell, is, eight, writing, we, see, further, that, a, ring, of, n, electrons, cannot, rotate, in, a, single, ring, round, a, nucleus, of, charge, n, e, unless, n, 8, for, smaller, atoms, the, electron, shells, would, be, filled, as, follows, rings, of, electrons, will, only, join, together, if, they, contain, equal, numbers, of, electrons, and, that, accordingly, the, numbers, of, electrons, on, inner, rings, will, only, be, 2, 4, 8, however, in, larger, atoms, the, innermost, shell, would, contain, eight, electrons, on, the, other, hand, the, periodic, system, of, the, elements, strongly, suggests, that, already, in, neon, n, 10, an, inner, ring, of, eight, electrons, will, occur, bohr, wrote, from, the, above, we, are, led, to, the, following, possible, scheme, for, the, arrangement, of, the, electrons, in, light, atoms, in, bohr, s, third, 1913, paper, part, iii, called, systems, containing, several, nuclei, he, says, that, two, atoms, form, molecules, on, a, symmetrical, plane, and, he, reverts, to, describing, hydrogen, the, 1913, bohr, model, did, not, discuss, higher, elements, in, detail, and, john, william, nicholson, was, one, of, the, first, to, prove, in, 1914, that, it, couldn, t, work, for, lithium, but, was, an, attractive, theory, for, hydrogen, and, ionized, helium, in, 1921, following, the, work, of, chemists, and, others, involved, in, work, on, the, periodic, table, bohr, extended, the, model, of, hydrogen, to, give, an, approximate, model, for, heavier, atoms, this, gave, a, physical, picture, that, reproduced, many, known, atomic, properties, for, the, first, time, although, these, properties, were, proposed, contemporarily, with, the, identical, work, of, chemist, charles, rugeley, bury, bohr, s, partner, in, research, during, 1914, to, 1916, was, walther, kossel, who, corrected, bohr, s, work, to, show, that, electrons, interacted, through, the, outer, rings, and, kossel, called, the, rings, shells, irving, langmuir, is, credited, with, the, first, viable, arrangement, of, electrons, in, shells, with, only, two, in, the, first, shell, and, going, up, to, eight, in, the, next, according, to, the, octet, rule, of, 1904, although, kossel, had, already, predicted, a, maximum, of, eight, per, shell, in, 1916, heavier, atoms, have, more, protons, in, the, nucleus, and, more, electrons, to, cancel, the, charge, bohr, took, from, these, chemists, the, idea, that, each, discrete, orbit, could, only, hold, a, certain, number, of, electrons, per, kossel, after, that, the, orbit, is, full, the, next, level, would, have, to, be, used, this, gives, the, atom, a, shell, structure, designed, by, kossel, langmuir, and, bury, in, which, each, shell, corresponds, to, a, bohr, orbit, this, model, is, even, more, approximate, than, the, model, of, hydrogen, because, it, treats, the, electrons, in, each, shell, as, non, interacting, but, the, repulsions, of, electrons, are, taken, into, account, somewhat, by, the, phenomenon, of, screening, the, electrons, in, outer, orbits, do, not, only, orbit, the, nucleus, but, they, also, move, around, the, inner, electrons, so, the, effective, charge, z, that, they, feel, is, reduced, by, the, number, of, the, electrons, in, the, inner, orbit, for, example, the, lithium, atom, has, two, electrons, in, the, lowest, 1s, orbit, and, these, orbit, at, z, 2, each, one, sees, the, nuclear, charge, of, z, 3, minus, the, screening, effect, of, the, other, which, crudely, reduces, the, nuclear, charge, by, 1, unit, this, means, that, the, innermost, electrons, orbit, at, approximately, 1, 2, the, bohr, radius, the, outermost, electron, in, lithium, orbits, at, roughly, the, bohr, radius, since, the, two, inner, electrons, reduce, the, nuclear, charge, by, 2, this, outer, electron, should, be, at, nearly, one, bohr, radius, from, the, nucleus, because, the, electrons, strongly, repel, each, other, the, effective, charge, description, is, very, approximate, the, effective, charge, z, doesn, t, usually, come, out, to, be, an, integer, the, shell, model, was, able, to, qualitatively, explain, many, of, the, mysterious, properties, of, atoms, which, became, codified, in, the, late, 19th, century, in, the, periodic, table, of, the, elements, one, property, was, the, size, of, atoms, which, could, be, determined, approximately, by, measuring, the, viscosity, of, gases, and, density, of, pure, crystalline, solids, atoms, tend, to, get, smaller, toward, the, right, in, the, periodic, table, and, become, much, larger, at, the, next, line, of, the, table, atoms, to, the, right, of, the, table, tend, to, gain, electrons, while, atoms, to, the, left, tend, to, lose, them, every, element, on, the, last, column, of, the, table, is, chemically, inert, noble, gas, in, the, shell, model, this, phenomenon, is, explained, by, shell, filling, successive, atoms, become, smaller, because, they, are, filling, orbits, of, the, same, size, until, the, orbit, is, full, at, which, point, the, next, atom, in, the, table, has, a, loosely, bound, outer, electron, causing, it, to, expand, the, first, bohr, orbit, is, filled, when, it, has, two, electrons, which, explains, why, helium, is, inert, the, second, orbit, allows, eight, electrons, and, when, it, is, full, the, atom, is, neon, again, inert, the, third, orbital, contains, eight, again, except, that, in, the, more, correct, sommerfeld, treatment, reproduced, in, modern, quantum, mechanics, there, are, extra, d, electrons, the, third, orbit, may, hold, an, extra, 10, d, electrons, but, these, positions, are, not, filled, until, a, few, more, orbitals, from, the, next, level, are, filled, filling, the, n, 3, d, orbitals, produces, the, 10, transition, elements, the, irregular, filling, pattern, is, an, effect, of, interactions, between, electrons, which, are, not, taken, into, account, in, either, the, bohr, or, sommerfeld, models, and, which, are, difficult, to, calculate, even, in, the, modern, treatment, niels, bohr, said, in, 1962, you, see, actually, the, rutherford, work, was, not, taken, seriously, we, cannot, understand, today, but, it, was, not, taken, seriously, at, all, there, was, no, mention, of, it, any, place, the, great, change, came, from, moseley, in, 1913, henry, moseley, found, an, empirical, relationship, between, the, strongest, x, ray, line, emitted, by, atoms, under, electron, bombardment, then, known, as, the, k, alpha, line, and, their, atomic, number, z, moseley, s, empiric, formula, was, found, to, be, derivable, from, rydberg, s, formula, and, later, bohr, s, formula, moseley, actually, mentions, only, ernest, rutherford, and, antonius, van, den, broek, in, terms, of, models, as, these, had, been, published, before, moseley, s, work, and, moseley, s, 1913, paper, was, published, the, same, month, as, the, first, bohr, model, paper, the, two, additional, assumptions, that, this, x, ray, line, came, from, a, transition, between, energy, levels, with, quantum, numbers, 1, and, 2, and, that, the, atomic, number, z, when, used, in, the, formula, for, atoms, heavier, than, hydrogen, should, be, diminished, by, 1, to, z, 1, 2, moseley, wrote, to, bohr, puzzled, about, his, results, but, bohr, was, not, able, to, help, at, that, time, he, thought, that, the, postulated, innermost, k, shell, of, electrons, should, have, at, least, four, electrons, not, the, two, which, would, have, neatly, explained, the, result, so, moseley, published, his, results, without, a, theoretical, explanation, it, was, walther, kossel, in, 1914, and, in, 1916, who, explained, that, in, the, periodic, table, new, elements, would, be, created, as, electrons, were, added, to, the, outer, shell, in, kossel, s, paper, he, writes, this, leads, to, the, conclusion, that, the, electrons, which, are, added, further, should, be, put, into, concentric, rings, or, shells, on, each, of, which, only, a, certain, number, of, electrons, namely, eight, in, our, case, should, be, arranged, as, soon, as, one, ring, or, shell, is, completed, a, new, one, has, to, be, started, for, the, next, element, the, number, of, electrons, which, are, most, easily, accessible, and, lie, at, the, outermost, periphery, increases, again, from, element, to, element, and, therefore, in, the, formation, of, each, new, shell, the, chemical, periodicity, is, repeated, later, chemist, langmuir, realized, that, the, effect, was, caused, by, charge, screening, with, an, inner, shell, containing, only, 2, electrons, in, his, 1919, paper, irving, langmuir, postulated, the, existence, of, cells, which, could, each, only, contain, two, electrons, each, and, these, were, arranged, in, equidistant, layers, in, the, moseley, experiment, one, of, the, innermost, electrons, in, the, atom, is, knocked, out, leaving, a, vacancy, in, the, lowest, bohr, orbit, which, contains, a, single, remaining, electron, this, vacancy, is, then, filled, by, an, electron, from, the, next, orbit, which, has, n, 2, but, the, n, 2, electrons, see, an, effective, charge, of, z, 1, which, is, the, value, appropriate, for, the, charge, of, the, nucleus, when, a, single, electron, remains, in, the, lowest, bohr, orbit, to, screen, the, nuclear, charge, z, and, lower, it, by, 1, due, to, the, electron, s, negative, charge, screening, the, nuclear, positive, charge, the, energy, gained, by, an, electron, dropping, from, the, second, shell, to, the, first, gives, moseley, s, law, for, k, alpha, lines, or, here, r, v, r, e, h, is, the, rydberg, constant, in, terms, of, frequency, equal, to, 3, 28, x, 10, 15, hz, for, values, of, z, between, 11, and, 31, this, latter, relationship, had, been, empirically, derived, by, moseley, in, a, simple, linear, plot, of, the, square, root, of, x, ray, frequency, against, atomic, number, however, for, silver, z, 47, the, experimentally, obtained, screening, term, should, be, replaced, by, 0, 4, notwithstanding, its, restricted, validity, moseley, s, law, not, only, established, the, objective, meaning, of, atomic, number, but, as, bohr, noted, it, also, did, more, than, the, rydberg, derivation, to, establish, the, validity, of, the, rutherford, van, den, broek, bohr, nuclear, model, of, the, atom, with, atomic, number, place, on, the, periodic, table, standing, for, whole, units, of, nuclear, charge, van, den, broek, had, published, his, model, in, january, 1913, showing, the, periodic, table, was, arranged, according, to, charge, while, bohr, s, atomic, model, was, not, published, until, july, 1913, the, k, alpha, line, of, moseley, s, time, is, now, known, to, be, a, pair, of, close, lines, written, as, k, 1, and, k, 2, in, siegbahn, notation, the, bohr, model, gives, an, incorrect, value, l, for, the, ground, state, orbital, angular, momentum, the, angular, momentum, in, the, true, ground, state, is, known, to, be, zero, from, experiment, although, mental, pictures, fail, somewhat, at, these, levels, of, scale, an, electron, in, the, lowest, modern, orbital, with, no, orbital, momentum, may, be, thought, of, as, not, to, rotate, around, the, nucleus, at, all, but, merely, to, go, tightly, around, it, in, an, ellipse, with, zero, area, this, may, be, pictured, as, back, and, forth, without, striking, or, interacting, with, the, nucleus, this, is, only, reproduced, in, a, more, sophisticated, semiclassical, treatment, like, sommerfeld, s, still, even, the, most, sophisticated, semiclassical, model, fails, to, explain, the, fact, that, the, lowest, energy, state, is, spherically, symmetric, it, doesn, t, point, in, any, particular, direction, nevertheless, in, the, modern, fully, quantum, treatment, in, phase, space, the, proper, deformation, careful, full, extension, of, the, semi, classical, result, adjusts, the, angular, momentum, value, to, the, correct, effective, one, as, a, consequence, the, physical, ground, state, expression, is, obtained, through, a, shift, of, the, vanishing, quantum, angular, momentum, expression, which, corresponds, to, spherical, symmetry, in, modern, quantum, mechanics, the, electron, in, hydrogen, is, a, spherical, cloud, of, probability, that, grows, denser, near, the, nucleus, the, rate, constant, of, probability, decay, in, hydrogen, is, equal, to, the, inverse, of, the, bohr, radius, but, since, bohr, worked, with, circular, orbits, not, zero, area, ellipses, the, fact, that, these, two, numbers, exactly, agree, is, considered, a, coincidence, however, many, such, coincidental, agreements, are, found, between, the, semiclassical, vs, full, quantum, mechanical, treatment, of, the, atom, these, include, identical, energy, levels, in, the, hydrogen, atom, and, the, derivation, of, a, fine, structure, constant, which, arises, from, the, relativistic, bohr, sommerfeld, model, see, below, and, which, happens, to, be, equal, to, an, entirely, different, concept, in, full, modern, quantum, mechanics, the, bohr, model, also, has, difficulty, with, or, else, fails, to, explain, several, enhancements, to, the, bohr, model, were, proposed, most, notably, the, sommerfeld, or, bohr, sommerfeld, models, which, suggested, that, electrons, travel, in, elliptical, orbits, around, a, nucleus, instead, of, the, bohr, model, s, circular, orbits, this, model, supplemented, the, quantized, angular, momentum, condition, of, the, bohr, model, with, an, additional, radial, quantization, condition, the, wilson, sommerfeld, quantization, condition, where, p, r, is, the, radial, momentum, canonically, conjugate, to, the, coordinate, q, r, which, is, the, radial, position, and, t, is, one, full, orbital, period, the, integral, is, the, action, of, action, angle, coordinates, this, condition, suggested, by, the, correspondence, principle, is, the, only, one, possible, since, the, quantum, numbers, are, adiabatic, invariants, the, bohr, sommerfeld, model, was, fundamentally, inconsistent, and, led, to, many, paradoxes, the, magnetic, quantum, number, measured, the, tilt, of, the, orbital, plane, relative, to, the, xy, plane, and, it, could, only, take, a, few, discrete, values, this, contradicted, the, obvious, fact, that, an, atom, could, be, turned, this, way, and, that, relative, to, the, coordinates, without, restriction, the, sommerfeld, quantization, can, be, performed, in, different, canonical, coordinates, and, sometimes, gives, different, answers, the, incorporation, of, radiation, corrections, was, difficult, because, it, required, finding, action, angle, coordinates, for, a, combined, radiation, atom, system, which, is, difficult, when, the, radiation, is, allowed, to, escape, the, whole, theory, did, not, extend, to, non, integrable, motions, which, meant, that, many, systems, could, not, be, treated, even, in, principle, in, the, end, the, model, was, replaced, by, the, modern, quantum, mechanical, treatment, of, the, hydrogen, atom, which, was, first, given, by, wolfgang, pauli, in, 1925, using, heisenberg, s, matrix, mechanics, the, current, picture, of, the, hydrogen, atom, is, based, on, the, atomic, orbitals, of, wave, mechanics, which, erwin, schr, dinger, developed, in, 1926, however, this, is, not, to, say, that, the, bohr, sommerfeld, model, was, without, its, successes, calculations, based, on, the, bohr, sommerfeld, model, were, able, to, accurately, explain, a, number, of, more, complex, atomic, spectral, effects, for, example, up, to, first, order, perturbations, the, bohr, model, and, quantum, mechanics, make, the, same, predictions, for, the, spectral, line, splitting, in, the, stark, effect, at, higher, order, perturbations, however, the, bohr, model, and, quantum, mechanics, differ, and, measurements, of, the, stark, effect, under, high, field, strengths, helped, confirm, the, correctness, of, quantum, mechanics, over, the, bohr, model, the, prevailing, theory, behind, this, difference, lies, in, the, shapes, of, the, orbitals, of, the, electrons, which, vary, according, to, the, energy, state, of, the, electron, the, bohr, sommerfeld, quantization, conditions, lead, to, questions, in, modern, mathematics, consistent, semiclassical, quantization, condition, requires, a, certain, type, of, structure, on, the, phase, space, which, places, topological, limitations, on, the, types, of, symplectic, manifolds, which, can, be, quantized, in, particular, the, symplectic, form, should, be, the, curvature, form, of, a, connection, of, a, hermitian, line, bundle, which, is, called, a, prequantization, bohr, also, updated, his, model, in, 1922, assuming, that, certain, numbers, of, electrons, for, example, 2, 8, and, 18, correspond, to, stable, closed, shells, niels, bohr, proposed, a, model, of, the, atom, and, a, model, of, the, chemical, bond, according, to, his, model, for, a, diatomic, molecule, the, electrons, of, the, atoms, of, the, molecule, form, a, rotating, ring, whose, plane, is, perpendicular, to, the, axis, of, the, molecule, and, equidistant, from, the, atomic, nuclei, the, dynamic, equilibrium, of, the, molecular, system, is, achieved, through, the, balance, of, forces, between, the, forces, of, attraction, of, nuclei, to, the, plane, of, the, ring, of, electrons, and, the, forces, of, mutual, repulsion, of, the, nuclei, the, bohr, model, of, the, chemical, bond, took, into, account, the, coulomb, repulsion, the, electrons, in, the, ring, are, at, the, maximum, distance, from, each, other, although, bohr, s, atomic, model, was, superseded, by, quantum, models, in, the, 1920, s, the, visual, image, of, electrons, orbiting, a, nucleus, has, remained, the, popular, concept, of, atoms, the, concept, of, an, atom, as, a, tiny, planetary, system, has, been, widely, used, as, a, symbol, for, atoms, and, even, for, atomic, energy, even, though, this, is, more, properly, considered, nuclear, energy, 58, examples, of, its, use, over, the, past, century, include, but, are, not, limited, to
