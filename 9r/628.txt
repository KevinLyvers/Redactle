a, mesa, is, an, isolated, flat, topped, elevation, ridge, or, hill, which, is, bounded, from, all, sides, by, steep, escarpments, and, stands, distinctly, above, a, surrounding, plain, mesas, characteristically, consist, of, flat, lying, soft, sedimentary, rocks, capped, by, a, more, resistant, layer, or, layers, of, harder, rock, e, g, shales, overlain, by, sandstones, the, resistant, layer, acts, as, a, caprock, that, forms, the, flat, summit, of, a, mesa, the, caprock, can, consist, of, either, sedimentary, rocks, such, as, sandstone, and, limestone, dissected, lava, flows, or, a, deeply, eroded, duricrust, unlike, plateau, whose, usage, does, not, imply, horizontal, layers, of, bedrock, e, g, tibetan, plateau, the, term, mesa, applies, exclusively, to, the, landforms, built, of, flat, lying, strata, instead, flat, topped, plateaus, are, specifically, known, as, tablelands, as, noted, by, geologist, kirk, bryan, in, 1922, mesas, stand, distinctly, above, the, surrounding, country, as, a, table, stands, above, the, floor, upon, which, it, rests, it, is, from, this, appearance, that, the, term, mesa, was, adopted, from, the, spanish, word, mesa, meaning, table, a, mesa, is, similar, to, but, has, a, more, extensive, summit, area, than, a, butte, there, is, no, agreed, size, limit, that, separates, mesas, from, either, buttes, or, plateaus, for, example, the, flat, topped, mountains, which, are, known, as, mesas, in, the, cockburn, range, of, north, western, australia, have, areas, as, large, as, 350, km, 2, 140, sq, mi, in, contrast, flat, topped, hills, with, areas, as, small, as, 0, 1, km, 2, 0, 039, sq, mi, in, the, elbe, sandstone, mountains, germany, are, described, as, mesas, less, strictly, a, very, broad, flat, topped, usually, isolated, hill, or, mountain, of, moderate, height, bounded, on, at, least, one, side, by, a, steep, cliff, or, slope, and, representing, an, erosion, remnant, also, have, been, called, mesas, in, the, english, language, geomorphic, and, geologic, literature, other, terms, for, mesa, have, also, been, used, for, example, in, the, roraima, region, of, venezuela, the, traditional, name, tepui, from, the, local, pom, n, language, and, the, term, table, mountains, have, been, used, to, describe, local, flat, topped, mountains, similar, landforms, in, australia, are, known, as, tablehills, table, top, hills, tent, hills, or, jump, ups, jump, ups, the, german, term, tafelberg, has, also, been, used, in, the, english, scientific, literature, in, the, past, mesas, form, by, weathering, and, erosion, of, horizontally, layered, rocks, that, have, been, uplifted, by, tectonic, activity, variations, in, the, ability, of, different, types, of, rock, to, resist, weathering, and, erosion, cause, the, weaker, types, of, rocks, to, be, eroded, away, leaving, the, more, resistant, types, of, rocks, topographically, higher, than, their, surroundings, this, process, is, called, differential, erosion, the, most, resistant, rock, types, include, sandstone, conglomerate, quartzite, basalt, chert, limestone, lava, flows, and, sills, lava, flows, and, sills, in, particular, are, very, resistant, to, weathering, and, erosion, and, often, form, the, flat, top, or, caprock, of, a, mesa, the, less, resistant, rock, layers, are, mainly, made, up, of, shale, a, softer, rock, that, weathers, and, erodes, more, easily, the, differences, in, strength, of, various, rock, layers, are, what, give, mesas, their, distinctive, shape, less, resistant, rocks, are, eroded, away, on, the, surface, into, valleys, where, they, collect, water, drainage, from, the, surrounding, area, while, the, more, resistant, layers, are, left, standing, out, a, large, area, of, very, resistant, rock, such, as, a, sill, may, shield, the, layers, below, it, from, erosion, while, the, softer, rock, surrounding, it, is, eroded, into, valleys, thus, forming, a, caprock, differences, in, rock, type, also, reflect, on, the, sides, of, a, mesa, as, instead, of, smooth, slopes, the, sides, are, broken, into, a, staircase, pattern, called, cliff, and, bench, topography, the, more, resistant, layers, form, the, cliffs, or, stairsteps, while, the, less, resistant, layers, form, gentle, slopes, or, benches, between, the, cliffs, cliffs, retreat, and, are, eventually, cut, off, from, the, main, cliff, or, plateau, by, basal, sapping, when, the, cliff, edge, does, not, retreat, uniformly, but, instead, is, indented, by, headward, eroding, streams, a, section, can, be, cut, off, from, the, main, cliff, forming, a, mesa, basal, sapping, occurs, as, water, flowing, around, the, rock, layers, of, the, mesa, erodes, the, underlying, soft, shale, layers, either, as, surface, runoff, from, the, mesa, top, or, from, groundwater, moving, through, permeable, overlying, layers, which, leads, to, slumping, and, flowage, of, the, shale, as, the, underlying, shale, erodes, away, it, can, no, longer, support, the, overlying, cliff, layers, which, collapse, and, retreat, when, the, caprock, has, caved, away, to, the, point, where, only, little, remains, it, is, known, as, a, butte, many, but, not, all, american, mesas, lie, within, the, basin, and, range, province, a, transitional, zone, on, mars, known, as, fretted, terrain, lies, between, highly, cratered, highlands, and, less, cratered, lowlands, the, younger, lowland, exhibits, steep, walled, mesas, and, knobs, the, mesa, and, knobs, are, separated, by, flat, lying, lowlands, they, are, thought, to, form, from, ice, facilitated, mass, wasting, processes, from, ground, or, atmospheric, sources, the, mesas, and, knobs, decrease, in, size, with, increasing, distance, from, the, highland, escarpment, the, relief, of, the, mesas, range, from, nearly, 2, km, 1, 2, mi, to, 100, m, 330, ft, depending, on, the, distance, they, are, from, the, escarpment
