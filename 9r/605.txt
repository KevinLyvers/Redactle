gneiss, n, a, s, nice, is, a, common, and, widely, distributed, type, of, metamorphic, rock, it, is, formed, by, high, temperature, and, high, pressure, metamorphic, processes, acting, on, formations, composed, of, igneous, or, sedimentary, rocks, this, rock, is, formed, under, pressures, anywhere, from, 2, to, 15, kbar, sometimes, even, more, and, temperatures, over, 300, c, 572, f, gneiss, nearly, always, shows, a, banded, texture, characterized, by, alternating, darker, and, lighter, colored, bands, and, without, a, distinct, cleavage, gneisses, are, common, in, the, ancient, crust, of, continental, shields, some, of, the, oldest, rocks, on, earth, are, gneisses, such, as, the, acasta, gneiss, in, traditional, english, and, north, american, usage, a, gneiss, is, a, coarse, grained, metamorphic, rock, showing, compositional, banding, gneissic, banding, but, poorly, developed, schistosity, and, indistinct, cleavage, in, other, words, it, is, a, metamorphic, rock, composed, of, mineral, grains, easily, seen, with, the, unaided, eye, which, form, obvious, compositional, layers, but, which, has, only, a, weak, tendency, to, fracture, along, these, layers, in, europe, the, term, has, been, more, widely, applied, to, any, coarse, mica, poor, high, grade, metamorphic, rock, the, british, geological, survey, bgs, and, the, international, union, of, geological, sciences, iugs, both, use, gneiss, as, a, broad, textural, category, for, medium, to, coarse, grained, metamorphic, rock, that, shows, poorly, developed, schistosity, with, compositional, layering, over, 5, millimeters, 0, 20, in, thick, and, tending, to, split, into, plates, over, 1, centimeter, 0, 39, in, thick, neither, definition, depends, on, composition, or, origin, though, rocks, poor, in, platy, minerals, are, more, likely, to, produce, gneissose, texture, gneissose, rocks, thus, are, largely, recrystallized, but, do, not, carry, large, quantities, of, micas, chlorite, or, other, platy, minerals, metamorphic, rock, showing, stronger, schistosity, is, classified, as, schist, while, metamorphic, rock, devoid, of, schistosity, is, called, a, granofels, gneisses, that, are, metamorphosed, igneous, rocks, or, their, equivalent, are, termed, granite, gneisses, diorite, gneisses, and, so, forth, gneiss, rocks, may, also, be, named, after, a, characteristic, component, such, as, garnet, gneiss, biotite, gneiss, albite, gneiss, and, so, forth, orthogneiss, designates, a, gneiss, derived, from, an, igneous, rock, and, paragneiss, is, one, from, a, sedimentary, rock, both, the, bgs, and, the, iugs, use, gneissose, to, describe, rocks, with, the, texture, of, gneiss, though, gneissic, also, remains, in, common, use, for, example, a, gneissose, metagranite, or, a, gneissic, metagranite, both, mean, a, granite, that, has, been, metamorphosed, and, thereby, acquired, gneissose, texture, the, minerals, in, gneiss, are, arranged, into, layers, that, appear, as, bands, in, cross, section, this, is, called, gneissic, banding, the, darker, bands, have, relatively, more, mafic, minerals, those, containing, more, magnesium, and, iron, the, lighter, bands, contain, relatively, more, felsic, minerals, minerals, such, as, feldspar, or, quartz, which, contain, more, of, the, lighter, elements, such, as, aluminium, sodium, and, potassium, the, banding, is, developed, at, high, temperature, when, the, rock, is, more, strongly, compressed, in, one, direction, than, in, other, directions, nonhydrostatic, stress, the, bands, develop, perpendicular, to, the, direction, of, greatest, compression, also, called, the, shortening, direction, as, platy, minerals, are, rotated, or, recrystallized, into, parallel, layers, a, common, cause, of, nonhydrodynamic, stress, is, the, subjection, of, the, protolith, the, original, rock, material, that, undergoes, metamorphism, to, extreme, shearing, force, a, sliding, force, similar, to, the, pushing, of, the, top, of, a, deck, of, cards, in, one, direction, and, the, bottom, of, the, deck, in, the, other, direction, these, forces, stretch, out, the, rock, like, a, plastic, and, the, original, material, is, spread, out, into, sheets, per, the, polar, decomposition, theorem, the, deformation, produced, by, such, shearing, force, is, equivalent, to, rotation, of, the, rock, combined, with, shortening, in, one, direction, and, extension, in, another, some, banding, is, formed, from, original, rock, material, protolith, that, is, subjected, to, extreme, temperature, and, pressure, and, is, composed, of, alternating, layers, of, sandstone, lighter, and, shale, darker, which, is, metamorphosed, into, bands, of, quartzite, and, mica, another, cause, of, banding, is, metamorphic, differentiation, which, separates, different, materials, into, different, layers, through, chemical, reactions, a, process, not, fully, understood, augen, gneiss, from, the, german, augen, meaning, eyes, is, a, gneiss, resulting, from, metamorphism, of, granite, which, contains, characteristic, elliptic, or, lenticular, shear, bound, grains, porphyroclasts, normally, feldspar, surrounded, by, finer, grained, material, the, finer, grained, material, deforms, around, the, more, resistant, feldspar, grains, to, produce, this, texture, migmatite, is, a, gneiss, consisting, of, two, or, more, distinct, rock, types, one, of, which, has, the, appearance, of, an, ordinary, gneiss, the, mesosome, and, another, of, which, has, the, appearance, of, an, intrusive, rock, such, pegmatite, aplite, or, granite, the, leucosome, the, rock, may, also, contain, a, melanosome, of, mafic, rock, complementary, to, the, leucosome, migmatites, are, often, interpreted, as, rock, that, has, been, partially, melted, with, the, leucosome, representing, the, silica, rich, melt, the, melanosome, the, residual, solid, rock, left, after, partial, melting, and, the, mesosome, the, original, rock, that, has, not, yet, experienced, partial, melting, gneisses, are, characteristic, of, areas, of, regional, metamorphism, that, reaches, the, middle, amphibolite, to, granulite, metamorphic, facies, in, other, words, the, rock, was, metamorphosed, at, a, temperature, in, excess, of, 600, c, 1, 112, f, at, pressures, between, about, 2, to, 24, kbar, many, different, varieties, of, rock, can, be, metamorphosed, to, gneiss, so, geologists, are, careful, to, add, descriptions, of, the, color, and, mineral, composition, to, the, name, of, any, gneiss, such, as, garnet, biotite, paragneiss, or, grayish, pink, orthogneiss, continental, shields, are, regions, of, exposed, ancient, rock, that, make, up, the, stable, cores, of, continents, the, rock, exposed, in, the, oldest, regions, of, shields, which, is, of, archean, age, over, 2500, million, years, old, mostly, belong, to, granite, greenstone, belts, the, greenstone, belts, contain, metavolcanic, and, metasedimentary, rock, that, has, undergone, a, relatively, mild, grade, of, metamorphism, at, temperatures, of, 350, 500, c, 662, 932, f, and, pressures, of, 200, 500, mpa, 2, 000, 5, 000, bar, the, greenstone, belts, are, surrounded, by, high, grade, gneiss, terrains, showing, highly, deformed, low, pressure, high, temperature, over, 500, c, 932, f, metamorphism, to, the, amphibolite, or, granulite, facies, these, form, most, of, the, exposed, rock, in, archean, cratons, gneiss, domes, are, common, in, orogenic, belts, regions, of, mountain, formation, they, consist, of, a, dome, of, gneiss, intruded, by, younger, granite, and, migmatite, and, mantled, with, sedimentary, rock, these, have, been, interpreted, as, a, geologic, record, of, two, distinct, mountain, forming, events, with, the, first, producing, the, granite, basement, and, the, second, deforming, and, melting, this, basement, to, produce, the, domes, however, some, gneiss, domes, may, actually, be, the, cores, of, metamorphic, core, complexes, regions, of, the, deep, crust, brought, to, the, surface, and, exposed, during, extension, of, the, earth, s, crust, the, word, gneiss, has, been, used, in, english, since, at, least, 1757, it, is, borrowed, from, the, german, word, gneis, formerly, also, spelled, gneiss, which, is, probably, derived, from, the, middle, high, german, noun, gneist, spark, so, called, because, the, rock, glitters, gneiss, has, been, used, as, a, building, material, such, as, the, facoidal, gneiss, used, extensively, in, rio, de, janeiro, gneiss, has, also, been, used, as, construction, aggregate, for, asphalt, pavement
