amber, is, fossilized, tree, resin, examples, of, it, have, been, appreciated, for, its, color, and, natural, beauty, since, the, neolithic, times, and, worked, as, a, gemstone, since, antiquity, amber, is, used, in, jewelry, and, as, a, healing, agent, in, folk, medicine, there, are, five, classes, of, amber, defined, on, the, basis, of, their, chemical, constituents, because, it, originates, as, a, soft, sticky, tree, resin, amber, sometimes, contains, animal, and, plant, material, as, inclusions, amber, occurring, in, coal, seams, is, also, called, resinite, and, the, term, ambrite, is, applied, to, that, found, specifically, within, new, zealand, coal, seams, the, english, word, amber, derives, from, arabic, anbar, ultimately, from, middle, persian, ambar, via, middle, latin, ambar, and, middle, french, ambre, the, word, referred, to, what, is, now, known, as, ambergris, ambre, gris, or, gray, amber, a, solid, waxy, substance, derived, from, the, sperm, whale, the, word, in, its, sense, of, ambergris, was, adopted, in, middle, english, in, the, 14th, century, in, the, romance, languages, the, sense, of, the, word, was, extended, to, baltic, amber, fossil, resin, from, as, early, as, the, late, 13th, century, at, first, called, white, or, yellow, amber, ambre, jaune, this, meaning, was, adopted, in, english, by, the, early, 15th, century, as, the, use, of, ambergris, waned, this, became, the, main, sense, of, the, word, the, two, substances, yellow, amber, and, gray, amber, conceivably, became, associated, or, confused, because, they, both, were, found, washed, up, on, beaches, ambergris, is, less, dense, than, water, and, floats, whereas, amber, is, too, dense, to, float, though, less, dense, than, stone, the, classical, names, for, amber, latin, electrum, and, ancient, greek, lektron, are, connected, to, a, term, lekt, r, meaning, beaming, sun, according, to, myth, when, pha, ton, son, of, helios, the, sun, was, killed, his, mourning, sisters, became, poplar, trees, and, their, tears, became, elektron, amber, the, word, elektron, gave, rise, to, the, words, electric, electricity, and, their, relatives, because, of, amber, s, ability, to, bear, a, charge, of, static, electricity, pliny, the, elder, says, that, the, german, name, of, amber, was, gl, sum, for, which, reason, the, romans, when, germanicus, commanded, the, fleet, in, those, parts, gave, to, one, of, these, islands, the, name, of, gl, saria, which, by, the, barbarians, was, known, as, austeravia, this, is, confirmed, by, the, recorded, old, high, german, word, glas, and, by, the, old, english, word, gl, r, for, amber, compare, glass, in, middle, low, german, amber, was, known, as, berne, barn, b, rnst, n, with, etymological, roots, related, to, burn, and, to, stone, the, low, german, term, became, dominant, also, in, high, german, by, the, 18th, century, thus, modern, german, bernstein, besides, dutch, barnsteen, in, the, baltic, languages, the, lithuanian, term, for, amber, is, gintaras, and, the, latvian, dzintars, these, words, and, the, slavic, jantar, and, hungarian, gyanta, resin, are, thought, to, originate, from, phoenician, jainitar, sea, resin, a, number, of, regional, and, varietal, names, have, been, applied, to, ambers, over, the, centuries, including, allingite, beckerite, gedanite, kochenite, krantzite, and, stantienite, theophrastus, discussed, amber, in, the, 4th, century, bce, as, did, pytheas, c, 330, bce, whose, work, on, the, ocean, is, lost, but, was, referenced, by, pliny, according, to, whose, natural, history, pytheas, says, that, the, gutones, a, people, of, germany, inhabit, the, shores, of, an, estuary, of, the, ocean, called, mentonomon, their, territory, extending, a, distance, of, six, thousand, stadia, that, at, one, day, s, sail, from, this, territory, is, the, isle, of, abalus, upon, the, shores, of, which, amber, is, thrown, up, by, the, waves, in, spring, it, being, an, excretion, of, the, sea, in, a, concrete, form, as, also, that, the, inhabitants, use, this, amber, by, way, of, fuel, and, sell, it, to, their, neighbors, the, teutones, earlier, pliny, says, that, pytheas, refers, to, a, large, island, three, days, sail, from, the, scythian, coast, and, called, balcia, by, xenophon, of, lampsacus, author, of, a, fanciful, travel, book, in, greek, as, basilia, a, name, generally, equated, with, abalus, given, the, presence, of, amber, the, island, could, have, been, heligoland, zealand, the, shores, of, gda, sk, bay, the, sambia, peninsula, or, the, curonian, lagoon, which, were, historically, the, richest, sources, of, amber, in, northern, europe, it, is, assumed, that, there, were, well, established, trade, routes, for, amber, connecting, the, baltic, with, the, mediterranean, known, as, the, amber, road, pliny, states, explicitly, that, the, germans, exported, amber, to, pannonia, from, where, the, veneti, distributed, it, onwards, the, ancient, italic, peoples, of, southern, italy, used, to, work, amber, the, national, archaeological, museum, of, siritide, museo, archeologico, nazionale, della, siritide, at, policoro, in, the, province, of, matera, basilicata, displays, important, surviving, examples, it, has, been, suggested, that, amber, used, in, antiquity, as, at, mycenae, and, in, the, prehistory, of, the, mediterranean, came, from, deposits, in, sicily, pliny, also, cites, the, opinion, of, nicias, c, 470, 413, bce, according, to, whom, amber, is, a, liquid, produced, by, the, rays, of, the, sun, and, that, these, rays, at, the, moment, of, the, sun, s, setting, striking, with, the, greatest, force, upon, the, surface, of, the, soil, leave, upon, it, an, unctuous, sweat, which, is, carried, off, by, the, tides, of, the, ocean, and, thrown, up, upon, the, shores, of, germany, besides, the, fanciful, explanations, according, to, which, amber, is, produced, by, the, sun, pliny, cites, opinions, that, are, well, aware, of, its, origin, in, tree, resin, citing, the, native, latin, name, of, succinum, s, cinum, from, sucus, juice, in, book, 37, section, xi, of, natural, history, pliny, wrote, amber, is, produced, from, a, marrow, discharged, by, trees, belonging, to, the, pine, genus, like, gum, from, the, cherry, and, resin, from, the, ordinary, pine, it, is, a, liquid, at, first, which, issues, forth, in, considerable, quantities, and, is, gradually, hardened, our, forefathers, too, were, of, opinion, that, it, is, the, juice, of, a, tree, and, for, this, reason, gave, it, the, name, of, succinum, and, one, great, proof, that, it, is, the, produce, of, a, tree, of, the, pine, genus, is, the, fact, that, it, emits, a, pine, like, smell, when, rubbed, and, that, it, burns, when, ignited, with, the, odour, and, appearance, of, torch, pine, wood, he, also, states, that, amber, is, also, found, in, egypt, and, india, and, he, even, refers, to, the, electrostatic, properties, of, amber, by, saying, that, in, syria, the, women, make, the, whorls, of, their, spindles, of, this, substance, and, give, it, the, name, of, harpax, from, the, circumstance, that, it, attracts, leaves, towards, it, chaff, and, the, light, fringe, of, tissues, the, romans, traded, for, amber, from, the, shores, of, the, southern, baltic, at, least, as, far, back, as, the, time, of, nero, amber, has, a, long, history, of, use, in, china, with, the, first, written, record, from, 200, bce, early, in, the, 19th, century, the, first, reports, of, amber, found, in, north, america, came, from, discoveries, in, new, jersey, along, crosswicks, creek, near, trenton, at, camden, and, near, woodbury, amber, is, heterogeneous, in, composition, but, consists, of, several, resinous, bodies, more, or, less, soluble, in, alcohol, ether, and, chloroform, associated, with, an, insoluble, bituminous, substance, amber, is, a, macromolecule, formed, by, free, radical, polymerization, of, several, precursors, in, the, labdane, family, for, example, communic, acid, communol, and, biformene, these, labdanes, are, diterpenes, c, 20, h, 32, and, trienes, equipping, the, organic, skeleton, with, three, alkene, groups, for, polymerization, as, amber, matures, over, the, years, more, polymerization, takes, place, as, well, as, isomerization, reactions, crosslinking, and, cyclization, most, amber, has, a, hardness, between, 2, 0, and, 2, 5, on, the, mohs, scale, a, refractive, index, of, 1, 5, 1, 6, a, specific, gravity, between, 1, 06, and, 1, 10, and, a, melting, point, of, 250, 300, c, heated, above, 200, c, 392, f, amber, decomposes, yielding, an, oil, of, amber, and, leaves, a, black, residue, which, is, known, as, amber, colophony, or, amber, pitch, when, dissolved, in, oil, of, turpentine, or, in, linseed, oil, this, forms, amber, varnish, or, amber, lac, molecular, polymerization, resulting, from, high, pressures, and, temperatures, produced, by, overlying, sediment, transforms, the, resin, first, into, copal, sustained, heat, and, pressure, drives, off, terpenes, and, results, in, the, formation, of, amber, for, this, to, happen, the, resin, must, be, resistant, to, decay, many, trees, produce, resin, but, in, the, majority, of, cases, this, deposit, is, broken, down, by, physical, and, biological, processes, exposure, to, sunlight, rain, microorganisms, and, extreme, temperatures, tends, to, disintegrate, the, resin, for, the, resin, to, survive, long, enough, to, become, amber, it, must, be, resistant, to, such, forces, or, be, produced, under, conditions, that, exclude, them, fossil, resins, from, europe, fall, into, two, categories, the, baltic, ambers, and, another, that, resembles, the, agathis, group, fossil, resins, from, the, americas, and, africa, are, closely, related, to, the, modern, genus, hymenaea, while, baltic, ambers, are, thought, to, be, fossil, resins, from, plants, of, the, family, sciadopityaceae, that, once, lived, in, north, europe, the, abnormal, development, of, resin, in, living, trees, succinosis, can, result, in, the, formation, of, amber, impurities, are, quite, often, present, especially, when, the, resin, has, dropped, onto, the, ground, so, the, material, may, be, useless, except, for, varnish, making, such, impure, amber, is, called, firniss, such, inclusion, of, other, substances, can, cause, the, amber, to, have, an, unexpected, color, pyrites, may, give, a, bluish, color, bony, amber, owes, its, cloudy, opacity, to, numerous, tiny, bubbles, inside, the, resin, however, so, called, black, amber, is, really, a, kind, of, jet, in, darkly, clouded, and, even, opaque, amber, inclusions, can, be, imaged, using, high, energy, high, contrast, high, resolution, x, rays, amber, is, globally, distributed, mainly, in, rocks, of, cretaceous, age, or, younger, historically, the, coast, west, of, k, nigsberg, in, prussia, was, the, world, s, leading, source, of, amber, the, first, mentions, of, amber, deposits, there, date, back, to, the, 12th, century, juodkrant, in, lithuania, was, established, in, the, mid, 19th, century, as, a, mining, town, of, amber, about, 90, of, the, world, s, extractable, amber, is, still, located, in, that, area, which, was, transferred, to, the, russian, soviet, federative, socialist, republic, of, the, ussr, in, 1946, becoming, the, kaliningrad, oblast, pieces, of, amber, torn, from, the, seafloor, are, cast, up, by, the, waves, and, collected, by, hand, dredging, or, diving, elsewhere, amber, is, mined, both, in, open, works, and, underground, galleries, then, nodules, of, blue, earth, have, to, be, removed, and, an, opaque, crust, must, be, cleaned, off, which, can, be, done, in, revolving, barrels, containing, sand, and, water, erosion, removes, this, crust, from, sea, worn, amber, dominican, amber, is, mined, through, bell, pitting, which, is, dangerous, because, of, the, risk, of, tunnel, collapse, an, important, source, of, amber, is, kachin, state, in, northern, myanmar, which, has, been, a, major, source, of, amber, in, china, for, at, least, 1, 800, years, contemporary, mining, of, this, deposit, has, attracted, attention, for, unsafe, working, conditions, and, its, role, in, funding, internal, conflict, in, the, country, amber, from, the, rivne, oblast, of, ukraine, referred, to, as, rivne, amber, is, mined, illegally, by, organised, crime, groups, who, deforest, the, surrounding, areas, and, pump, water, into, the, sediments, to, extract, the, amber, causing, severe, environmental, deterioration, the, vienna, amber, factories, which, use, pale, amber, to, manufacture, pipes, and, other, smoking, tools, turn, it, on, a, lathe, and, polish, it, with, whitening, and, water, or, with, rotten, stone, and, oil, the, final, luster, is, given, by, polishing, with, flannel, when, gradually, heated, in, an, oil, bath, amber, becomes, soft, and, flexible, two, pieces, of, amber, may, be, united, by, smearing, the, surfaces, with, linseed, oil, heating, them, and, then, pressing, them, together, while, hot, cloudy, amber, may, be, clarified, in, an, oil, bath, as, the, oil, fills, the, numerous, pores, that, cause, the, turbidity, small, fragments, formerly, thrown, away, or, used, only, for, varnish, are, now, used, on, a, large, scale, in, the, formation, of, ambroid, or, pressed, amber, the, pieces, are, carefully, heated, with, exclusion, of, air, and, then, compressed, into, a, uniform, mass, by, intense, hydraulic, pressure, the, softened, amber, being, forced, through, holes, in, a, metal, plate, the, product, is, extensively, used, for, the, production, of, cheap, jewelry, and, articles, for, smoking, this, pressed, amber, yields, brilliant, interference, colors, in, polarized, light, amber, has, often, been, imitated, by, other, resins, like, copal, and, kauri, gum, as, well, as, by, celluloid, and, even, glass, baltic, amber, is, sometimes, colored, artificially, but, also, called, true, amber, amber, occurs, in, a, range, of, different, colors, as, well, as, the, usual, yellow, orange, brown, that, is, associated, with, the, color, amber, amber, can, range, from, a, whitish, color, through, a, pale, lemon, yellow, to, brown, and, almost, black, other, uncommon, colors, include, red, amber, sometimes, known, as, cherry, amber, green, amber, and, even, blue, amber, which, is, rare, and, highly, sought, after, yellow, amber, is, a, hard, fossil, resin, from, evergreen, trees, and, despite, the, name, it, can, be, translucent, yellow, orange, or, brown, colored, known, to, the, iranians, by, the, pahlavi, compound, word, kah, ruba, from, kah, straw, plus, rubay, attract, snatch, referring, to, its, electrical, properties, which, entered, arabic, as, kahraba, or, kahraba, which, later, became, the, arabic, word, for, electricity, kahrab, it, too, was, called, amber, in, europe, old, french, and, middle, english, ambre, found, along, the, southern, shore, of, the, baltic, sea, yellow, amber, reached, the, middle, east, and, western, europe, via, trade, its, coastal, acquisition, may, have, been, one, reason, yellow, amber, came, to, be, designated, by, the, same, term, as, ambergris, moreover, like, ambergris, the, resin, could, be, burned, as, an, incense, the, resin, s, most, popular, use, was, however, for, ornamentation, easily, cut, and, polished, it, could, be, transformed, into, beautiful, jewelry, much, of, the, most, highly, prized, amber, is, transparent, in, contrast, to, the, very, common, cloudy, amber, and, opaque, amber, opaque, amber, contains, numerous, minute, bubbles, this, kind, of, amber, is, known, as, bony, amber, although, all, dominican, amber, is, fluorescent, the, rarest, dominican, amber, is, blue, amber, it, turns, blue, in, natural, sunlight, and, any, other, partially, or, wholly, ultraviolet, light, source, in, long, wave, uv, light, it, has, a, very, strong, reflection, almost, white, only, about, 100, kg, 220, lb, is, found, per, year, which, makes, it, valuable, and, expensive, sometimes, amber, retains, the, form, of, drops, and, stalactites, just, as, it, exuded, from, the, ducts, and, receptacles, of, the, injured, trees, it, is, thought, that, in, addition, to, exuding, onto, the, surface, of, the, tree, amber, resin, also, originally, flowed, into, hollow, cavities, or, cracks, within, trees, thereby, leading, to, the, development, of, large, lumps, of, amber, of, irregular, form, amber, can, be, classified, into, several, forms, most, fundamentally, there, are, two, types, of, plant, resin, with, the, potential, for, fossilization, terpenoids, produced, by, conifers, and, angiosperms, consist, of, ring, structures, formed, of, isoprene, c, 5, h, 8, units, phenolic, resins, are, today, only, produced, by, angiosperms, and, tend, to, serve, functional, uses, the, extinct, medullosans, produced, a, third, type, of, resin, which, is, often, found, as, amber, within, their, veins, the, composition, of, resins, is, highly, variable, each, species, produces, a, unique, blend, of, chemicals, which, can, be, identified, by, the, use, of, pyrolysis, gas, chromatography, mass, spectrometry, the, overall, chemical, and, structural, composition, is, used, to, divide, ambers, into, five, classes, there, is, also, a, separate, classification, of, amber, gemstones, according, to, the, way, of, production, this, class, is, by, far, the, most, abundant, it, comprises, labdatriene, carboxylic, acids, such, as, communic, or, ozic, acids, it, is, further, split, into, three, sub, classes, classes, ia, and, ib, utilize, regular, labdanoid, diterpenes, e, g, communic, acid, communol, biformenes, while, ic, uses, enantio, labdanoids, ozic, acid, ozol, enantio, biformenes, class, ia, includes, succinite, normal, baltic, amber, and, glessite, they, have, a, communic, acid, base, and, they, also, include, much, succinic, acid, baltic, amber, yields, on, dry, distillation, succinic, acid, the, proportion, varying, from, about, 3, to, 8, and, being, greatest, in, the, pale, opaque, or, bony, varieties, the, aromatic, and, irritating, fumes, emitted, by, burning, amber, are, mainly, from, this, acid, baltic, amber, is, distinguished, by, its, yield, of, succinic, acid, hence, the, name, succinite, succinite, has, a, hardness, between, 2, and, 3, which, is, greater, than, many, other, fossil, resins, its, specific, gravity, varies, from, 1, 05, to, 1, 10, it, can, be, distinguished, from, other, ambers, via, infrared, spectroscopy, through, a, specific, carbonyl, absorption, peak, infrared, spectroscopy, can, detect, the, relative, age, of, an, amber, sample, succinic, acid, may, not, be, an, original, component, of, amber, but, rather, a, degradation, product, of, abietic, acid, class, ib, ambers, are, based, on, communic, acid, however, they, lack, succinic, acid, class, ic, is, mainly, based, on, enantio, labdatrienonic, acids, such, as, ozic, and, zanzibaric, acids, its, most, familiar, representative, is, dominican, amber, which, is, mostly, transparent, and, often, contains, a, higher, number, of, fossil, inclusions, this, has, enabled, the, detailed, reconstruction, of, the, ecosystem, of, a, long, vanished, tropical, forest, resin, from, the, extinct, species, hymenaea, protera, is, the, source, of, dominican, amber, and, probably, of, most, amber, found, in, the, tropics, it, is, not, succinite, but, retinite, these, ambers, are, formed, from, resins, with, a, sesquiterpenoid, base, such, as, cadinene, these, ambers, are, polystyrenes, class, iv, is, something, of, a, catch, all, its, ambers, are, not, polymerized, but, mainly, consist, of, cedrene, based, sesquiterpenoids, class, v, resins, are, considered, to, be, produced, by, a, pine, or, pine, relative, they, comprise, a, mixture, of, diterpinoid, resins, and, n, alkyl, compounds, their, main, variety, is, highgate, copalite, the, oldest, amber, recovered, dates, to, the, late, carboniferous, period, 320, million, years, ago, its, chemical, composition, makes, it, difficult, to, match, the, amber, to, its, producers, it, is, most, similar, to, the, resins, produced, by, flowering, plants, however, the, first, flowering, plants, appeared, in, the, early, cretaceous, about, 200, million, years, after, the, oldest, amber, known, to, date, and, they, were, not, common, until, the, late, cretaceous, amber, becomes, abundant, long, after, the, carboniferous, in, the, early, cretaceous, when, it, is, found, in, association, with, insects, the, oldest, amber, with, arthropod, inclusions, comes, from, the, late, triassic, late, carnian, c, 230, ma, of, italy, where, four, microscopic, 0, 2, 0, 1, mm, mites, triasacarus, ampezzoa, minyacarus, and, cheirolepidoptus, and, a, poorly, preserved, nematoceran, fly, were, found, in, millimetre, sized, droplets, of, amber, the, oldest, amber, with, significant, numbers, of, arthropod, inclusions, comes, from, lebanon, this, amber, referred, to, as, lebanese, amber, is, roughly, 125, 135, million, years, old, is, considered, of, high, scientific, value, providing, evidence, of, some, of, the, oldest, sampled, ecosystems, in, lebanon, more, than, 450, outcrops, of, lower, cretaceous, amber, were, discovered, by, dany, azar, a, lebanese, paleontologist, and, entomologist, among, these, outcrops, 20, have, yielded, biological, inclusions, comprising, the, oldest, representatives, of, several, recent, families, of, terrestrial, arthropods, even, older, jurassic, amber, has, been, found, recently, in, lebanon, as, well, many, remarkable, insects, and, spiders, were, recently, discovered, in, the, amber, of, jordan, including, the, oldest, zorapterans, clerid, beetles, umenocoleid, roaches, and, achiliid, planthoppers, burmese, amber, from, the, hukawng, valley, in, northern, myanmar, is, the, only, commercially, exploited, cretaceous, amber, uranium, lead, dating, of, zircon, crystals, associated, with, the, deposit, have, given, an, estimated, depositional, age, of, approximately, 99, million, years, ago, over, 1, 300, species, have, been, described, from, the, amber, with, over, 300, in, 2019, alone, baltic, amber, is, found, as, irregular, nodules, in, marine, glauconitic, sand, known, as, blue, earth, occurring, in, upper, eocene, strata, of, sambia, in, prussia, it, appears, to, have, been, partly, derived, from, older, eocene, deposits, and, it, occurs, also, as, a, derivative, phase, in, later, formations, such, as, glacial, drift, relics, of, an, abundant, flora, occur, as, inclusions, trapped, within, the, amber, while, the, resin, was, yet, fresh, suggesting, relations, with, the, flora, of, eastern, asia, and, the, southern, part, of, north, america, heinrich, g, ppert, named, the, common, amber, yielding, pine, of, the, baltic, forests, pinites, succiniter, but, as, the, wood, does, not, seem, to, differ, from, that, of, the, existing, genus, it, has, been, also, called, pinus, succinifera, it, is, improbable, that, the, production, of, amber, was, limited, to, a, single, species, and, indeed, a, large, number, of, conifers, belonging, to, different, genera, are, represented, in, the, amber, flora, amber, is, a, unique, preservational, mode, preserving, otherwise, unfossilizable, parts, of, organisms, as, such, it, is, helpful, in, the, reconstruction, of, ecosystems, as, well, as, organisms, the, chemical, composition, of, the, resin, however, is, of, limited, utility, in, reconstructing, the, phylogenetic, affinity, of, the, resin, producer, amber, sometimes, contains, animals, or, plant, matter, that, became, caught, in, the, resin, as, it, was, secreted, insects, spiders, and, even, their, webs, annelids, frogs, crustaceans, bacteria, and, amoebae, marine, microfossils, wood, flowers, and, fruit, hair, feathers, and, other, small, organisms, have, been, recovered, in, cretaceous, ambers, deposited, c, 130, million, years, ago, there, is, even, an, ammonite, puzosia, bhimaites, and, marine, gastropods, found, in, burmese, amber, the, preservation, of, prehistoric, organisms, in, amber, forms, a, key, plot, point, in, michael, crichton, s, 1990, novel, jurassic, park, and, the, 1993, movie, adaptation, by, steven, spielberg, in, the, story, scientists, are, able, to, extract, the, preserved, blood, of, dinosaurs, from, prehistoric, mosquitoes, trapped, in, amber, from, which, they, genetically, clone, living, dinosaurs, scientifically, this, is, as, yet, impossible, since, no, amber, with, fossilized, mosquitoes, has, ever, yielded, preserved, blood, amber, is, however, conducive, to, preserving, dna, since, it, dehydrates, and, thus, stabilizes, organisms, trapped, inside, one, projection, in, 1999, estimated, that, dna, trapped, in, amber, could, last, up, to, 100, million, years, far, beyond, most, estimates, of, around, 1, million, years, in, the, most, ideal, conditions, although, a, later, 2013, study, was, unable, to, extract, dna, from, insects, trapped, in, much, more, recent, holocene, copal, in, 1938, 12,
