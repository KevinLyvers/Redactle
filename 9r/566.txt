in, geology, a, fault, is, a, planar, fracture, or, discontinuity, in, a, volume, of, rock, across, which, there, has, been, significant, displacement, as, a, result, of, rock, mass, movements, large, faults, within, earth, s, crust, result, from, the, action, of, plate, tectonic, forces, with, the, largest, forming, the, boundaries, between, the, plates, such, as, the, megathrust, faults, of, subduction, zones, or, transform, faults, energy, release, associated, with, rapid, movement, on, active, faults, is, the, cause, of, most, earthquakes, faults, may, also, displace, slowly, by, aseismic, creep, a, fault, plane, is, the, plane, that, represents, the, fracture, surface, of, a, fault, a, fault, trace, or, fault, line, is, a, place, where, the, fault, can, be, seen, or, mapped, on, the, surface, a, fault, trace, is, also, the, line, commonly, plotted, on, geologic, maps, to, represent, a, fault, a, fault, zone, is, a, cluster, of, parallel, faults, however, the, term, is, also, used, for, the, zone, of, crushed, rock, along, a, single, fault, prolonged, motion, along, closely, spaced, faults, can, blur, the, distinction, as, the, rock, between, the, faults, is, converted, to, fault, bound, lenses, of, rock, and, then, progressively, crushed, due, to, friction, and, the, rigidity, of, the, constituent, rocks, the, two, sides, of, a, fault, cannot, always, glide, or, flow, past, each, other, easily, and, so, occasionally, all, movement, stops, the, regions, of, higher, friction, along, a, fault, plane, where, it, becomes, locked, are, called, asperities, stress, builds, up, when, a, fault, is, locked, and, when, it, reaches, a, level, that, exceeds, the, strength, threshold, the, fault, ruptures, and, the, accumulated, strain, energy, is, released, in, part, as, seismic, waves, forming, an, earthquake, strain, occurs, accumulatively, or, instantaneously, depending, on, the, liquid, state, of, the, rock, the, ductile, lower, crust, and, mantle, accumulate, deformation, gradually, via, shearing, whereas, the, brittle, upper, crust, reacts, by, fracture, instantaneous, stress, release, resulting, in, motion, along, the, fault, a, fault, in, ductile, rocks, can, also, release, instantaneously, when, the, strain, rate, is, too, great, slip, is, defined, as, the, relative, movement, of, geological, features, present, on, either, side, of, a, fault, plane, a, fault, s, sense, of, slip, is, defined, as, the, relative, motion, of, the, rock, on, each, side, of, the, fault, concerning, the, other, side, in, measuring, the, horizontal, or, vertical, separation, the, throw, of, the, fault, is, the, vertical, component, of, the, separation, and, the, heave, of, the, fault, is, the, horizontal, component, as, in, throw, up, and, heave, out, the, vector, of, slip, can, be, qualitatively, assessed, by, studying, any, drag, folding, of, strata, which, may, be, visible, on, either, side, of, the, fault, drag, folding, is, a, zone, of, folding, close, to, a, fault, that, likely, arises, from, frictional, resistance, to, movement, on, the, fault, the, direction, and, magnitude, of, heave, and, throw, can, be, measured, only, by, finding, common, intersection, points, on, either, side, of, the, fault, called, a, piercing, point, in, practice, it, is, usually, only, possible, to, find, the, slip, direction, of, faults, and, an, approximation, of, the, heave, and, throw, vector, the, two, sides, of, a, non, vertical, fault, are, known, as, the, hanging, wall, and, footwall, the, hanging, wall, occurs, above, the, fault, plane, and, the, footwall, occurs, below, it, this, terminology, comes, from, mining, when, working, a, tabular, ore, body, the, miner, stood, with, the, footwall, under, his, feet, and, with, the, hanging, wall, above, him, these, terms, are, important, for, distinguishing, different, dip, slip, fault, types, reverse, faults, and, normal, faults, in, a, reverse, fault, the, hanging, wall, displaces, upward, while, in, a, normal, fault, the, hanging, wall, displaces, downward, distinguishing, between, these, two, fault, types, is, important, for, determining, the, stress, regime, of, the, fault, movement, faults, are, mainly, classified, in, terms, of, the, angle, that, the, fault, plane, makes, with, the, earth, s, surface, known, as, the, dip, and, the, direction, of, slip, along, the, fault, plane, based, on, the, direction, of, slip, faults, can, be, categorized, as, in, a, strike, slip, fault, also, known, as, a, wrench, fault, tear, fault, or, transcurrent, fault, the, fault, surface, plane, is, usually, near, vertical, and, the, footwall, moves, laterally, either, left, or, right, with, very, little, vertical, motion, strike, slip, faults, with, left, lateral, motion, are, also, known, as, sinistral, faults, and, those, with, right, lateral, motion, as, dextral, faults, each, is, defined, by, the, direction, of, movement, of, the, ground, as, would, be, seen, by, an, observer, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, fault, a, special, class, of, strike, slip, fault, is, the, transform, fault, when, it, forms, a, plate, boundary, this, class, is, related, to, an, offset, in, a, spreading, center, such, as, a, mid, ocean, ridge, or, less, common, within, continental, lithosphere, such, as, the, dead, sea, transform, in, the, middle, east, or, the, alpine, fault, in, new, zealand, transform, faults, are, also, referred, to, as, conservative, plate, boundaries, since, the, lithosphere, is, neither, created, nor, destroyed, dip, slip, faults, can, be, either, normal, extensional, or, reverse, the, terminology, of, normal, and, reverse, comes, from, coal, mining, in, england, where, normal, faults, are, the, most, common, with, the, passage, of, time, a, regional, reversal, between, tensional, and, compressional, stresses, or, vice, versa, might, occur, and, faults, may, be, reactivated, with, their, relative, block, movement, inverted, in, opposite, directions, to, the, original, movement, fault, inversion, in, such, a, way, a, normal, fault, may, therefore, become, a, reverse, fault, and, vice, versa, in, a, normal, fault, the, hanging, wall, moves, downward, relative, to, the, footwall, the, dip, of, most, normal, faults, is, at, least, 60, degrees, but, some, normal, faults, dip, at, less, than, 45, degrees, a, downthrown, block, between, two, normal, faults, dipping, towards, each, other, is, a, graben, a, block, stranded, between, two, grabens, and, therefore, two, normal, faults, dipping, away, from, each, other, is, a, horst, a, sequence, of, grabens, and, horsts, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, produces, a, characteristic, basin, and, range, topography, normal, faults, can, evolve, into, listric, faults, with, their, plane, dip, being, steeper, near, the, surface, then, shallower, with, increased, depth, with, the, fault, plane, curving, into, the, earth, they, can, also, form, where, the, hanging, wall, is, absent, such, as, on, a, cliff, where, the, footwall, may, slump, in, a, manner, that, creates, multiple, listric, faults, the, fault, panes, of, listric, faults, can, further, flatten, and, evolve, into, a, horizontal, or, near, horizontal, plane, where, slip, progresses, horizontally, along, a, decollement, extensional, decollements, can, grow, to, great, dimensions, and, form, detachment, faults, which, are, low, angle, normal, faults, with, regional, tectonic, significance, due, to, the, curvature, of, the, fault, plane, the, horizontal, extensional, displacement, on, a, listric, fault, implies, a, geometric, gap, between, the, hanging, and, footwalls, of, the, fault, forms, when, the, slip, motion, occurs, to, accommodate, into, the, geometric, gap, and, depending, on, its, rheology, the, hanging, wall, might, fold, and, slide, downwards, into, the, gap, and, produce, rollover, folding, or, break, into, further, faults, and, blocks, which, fil, in, the, gap, if, faults, form, imbrication, fans, or, domino, faulting, may, form, a, reverse, fault, is, the, opposite, of, a, normal, fault, the, hanging, wall, moves, up, relative, to, the, footwall, reverse, faults, indicate, compressive, shortening, of, the, crust, a, thrust, fault, has, the, same, sense, of, motion, as, a, reverse, fault, but, with, the, dip, of, the, fault, plane, at, less, than, 45, thrust, faults, typically, form, ramps, flats, and, fault, bend, hanging, wall, and, footwall, folds, a, section, of, a, hanging, wall, or, foot, wall, where, a, thrust, fault, formed, along, a, relatively, weak, bedding, plane, is, known, as, a, flat, and, a, section, where, the, thrust, fault, cut, upward, through, the, stratigraphic, sequence, is, known, as, a, ramp, typically, thrust, faults, move, within, formations, by, forming, flats, and, climbing, up, sections, with, ramps, this, results, in, the, hanging, wall, flat, or, a, portion, thereof, lying, atop, the, foot, wall, ramp, as, shown, in, the, fault, bend, fold, diagram, thrust, faults, form, nappes, and, klippen, in, the, large, thrust, belts, subduction, zones, are, a, special, class, of, thrusts, that, form, the, largest, faults, on, earth, and, give, rise, to, the, largest, earthquakes, a, fault, which, has, a, component, of, dip, slip, and, a, component, of, strike, slip, is, termed, an, oblique, slip, fault, nearly, all, faults, have, some, component, of, both, dip, slip, and, strike, slip, hence, defining, a, fault, as, oblique, requires, both, dip, and, strike, components, to, be, measurable, and, significant, some, oblique, faults, occur, within, transtensional, and, transpressional, regimes, and, others, occur, where, the, direction, of, extension, or, shortening, changes, during, the, deformation, but, the, earlier, formed, faults, remain, active, the, hade, angle, is, defined, as, the, complement, of, the, dip, angle, it, is, the, angle, between, the, fault, plane, and, a, vertical, plane, that, strikes, parallel, to, the, fault, ring, faults, also, known, as, caldera, faults, are, faults, that, occur, within, collapsed, volcanic, calderas, and, the, sites, of, bolide, strikes, such, as, the, chesapeake, bay, impact, crater, ring, faults, are, the, result, of, a, series, of, overlapping, normal, faults, forming, a, circular, outline, fractures, created, by, ring, faults, may, be, filled, by, ring, dikes, synthetic, and, antithetic, are, terms, used, to, describe, minor, faults, associated, with, a, major, fault, synthetic, faults, dip, in, the, same, direction, as, the, major, fault, while, the, antithetic, faults, dip, in, the, opposite, direction, these, faults, may, be, accompanied, by, rollover, anticlines, e, g, the, niger, delta, structural, style, all, faults, have, a, measurable, thickness, made, up, of, deformed, rock, characteristic, of, the, level, in, the, crust, where, the, faulting, happened, of, the, rock, types, affected, by, the, fault, and, of, the, presence, and, nature, of, any, mineralising, fluids, fault, rocks, are, classified, by, their, textures, and, the, implied, mechanism, of, deformation, a, fault, that, passes, through, different, levels, of, the, lithosphere, will, have, many, different, types, of, fault, rock, developed, along, its, surface, continued, dip, slip, displacement, tends, to, juxtapose, fault, rocks, characteristic, of, different, crustal, levels, with, varying, degrees, of, overprinting, this, effect, is, particularly, clear, in, the, case, of, detachment, faults, and, major, thrust, faults, the, main, types, of, fault, rock, include, in, geotechnical, engineering, a, fault, often, forms, a, discontinuity, that, may, have, a, large, influence, on, the, mechanical, behavior, strength, deformation, etc, of, soil, and, rock, masses, in, for, example, tunnel, foundation, or, slope, construction, the, level, of, a, fault, s, activity, can, be, critical, for, 1, locating, buildings, tanks, and, pipelines, and, 2, assessing, the, seismic, shaking, and, tsunami, hazard, to, infrastructure, and, people, in, the, vicinity, in, california, for, example, new, building, construction, has, been, prohibited, directly, on, or, near, faults, that, have, moved, within, the, holocene, epoch, the, last, 11, 700, years, of, the, earth, s, geological, history, also, faults, that, have, shown, movement, during, the, holocene, plus, pleistocene, epochs, the, last, 2, 6, million, years, may, receive, consideration, especially, for, critical, structures, such, as, power, plants, dams, hospitals, and, schools, geologists, assess, a, fault, s, age, by, studying, soil, features, seen, in, shallow, excavations, and, geomorphology, seen, in, aerial, photographs, subsurface, clues, include, shears, and, their, relationships, to, carbonate, nodules, eroded, clay, and, iron, oxide, mineralization, in, the, case, of, older, soil, and, lack, of, such, signs, in, the, case, of, younger, soil, radiocarbon, dating, of, organic, material, buried, next, to, or, over, a, fault, shear, is, often, critical, in, distinguishing, active, from, inactive, faults, from, such, relationships, paleoseismologists, can, estimate, the, sizes, of, past, earthquakes, over, the, past, several, hundred, years, and, develop, rough, projections, of, future, fault, activity, many, ore, deposits, lie, on, or, are, associated, with, faults, this, is, because, the, fractured, rock, associated, with, fault, zones, allow, for, magma, ascent, or, the, circulation, of, mineral, bearing, fluids, intersections, of, near, vertical, faults, are, often, locations, of, significant, ore, deposits, an, example, of, a, fault, hosting, valuable, porphyry, copper, deposits, is, northern, chile, s, domeyko, fault, with, deposits, at, chuquicamata, collahuasi, el, abra, el, salvador, la, escondida, and, potrerillos, further, south, in, chile, los, bronces, and, el, teniente, porphyry, copper, deposit, lie, each, at, the, intersection, of, two, fault, systems, faults, may, not, always, act, as, conduits, to, surface, it, has, been, proposed, that, deep, seated, misoriented, faults, may, instead, be, zones, where, magmas, forming, porphyry, copper, stagnate, achieving, the, right, time, for, and, type, of, igneous, differentiation, at, a, given, time, differentiated, magmas, would, burst, violently, out, of, the, fault, traps, and, head, to, shallower, places, in, the, crust, where, porphyry, copper, deposits, would, be, formed, as, faults, are, zones, of, weakness, they, facilitate, the, interaction, of, water, with, the, surrounding, rock, and, enhance, chemical, weathering, the, enhanced, chemical, weathering, increases, the, size, of, the, weathered, zone, and, hence, creates, more, space, for, groundwater, fault, zones, act, as, aquifers, and, also, assist, groundwater, transport
