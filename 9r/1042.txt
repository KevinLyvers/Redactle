in, particle, physics, a, lepton, is, an, elementary, particle, of, half, integer, spin, spin, 1, 2, that, does, not, undergo, strong, interactions, two, main, classes, of, leptons, exist, charged, leptons, also, known, as, the, electron, like, leptons, or, muons, including, the, electron, muon, and, tauon, and, neutral, leptons, better, known, as, neutrinos, charged, leptons, can, combine, with, other, particles, to, form, various, composite, particles, such, as, atoms, and, positronium, while, neutrinos, rarely, interact, with, anything, and, are, consequently, rarely, observed, the, best, known, of, all, leptons, is, the, electron, there, are, six, types, of, leptons, known, as, flavours, grouped, in, three, generations, the, first, generation, leptons, also, called, electronic, leptons, comprise, the, electron, e, and, the, electron, neutrino, e, the, second, are, the, muonic, leptons, comprising, the, muon, and, the, muon, neutrino, and, the, third, are, the, tauonic, leptons, comprising, the, tau, and, the, tau, neutrino, electrons, have, the, least, mass, of, all, the, charged, leptons, the, heavier, muons, and, taus, will, rapidly, change, into, electrons, and, neutrinos, through, a, process, of, particle, decay, the, transformation, from, a, higher, mass, state, to, a, lower, mass, state, thus, electrons, are, stable, and, the, most, common, charged, lepton, in, the, universe, whereas, muons, and, taus, can, only, be, produced, in, high, energy, collisions, such, as, those, involving, cosmic, rays, and, those, carried, out, in, particle, accelerators, leptons, have, various, intrinsic, properties, including, electric, charge, spin, and, mass, unlike, quarks, however, leptons, are, not, subject, to, the, strong, interaction, but, they, are, subject, to, the, other, three, fundamental, interactions, gravitation, the, weak, interaction, and, to, electromagnetism, of, which, the, latter, is, proportional, to, charge, and, is, thus, zero, for, the, electrically, neutral, neutrinos, for, every, lepton, flavor, there, is, a, corresponding, type, of, antiparticle, known, as, an, antilepton, that, differs, from, the, lepton, only, in, that, some, of, its, properties, have, equal, magnitude, but, opposite, sign, according, to, certain, theories, neutrinos, may, be, their, own, antiparticle, it, is, not, currently, known, whether, this, is, the, case, the, first, charged, lepton, the, electron, was, theorized, in, the, mid, 19th, century, by, several, scientists, and, was, discovered, in, 1897, by, j, j, thomson, the, next, lepton, to, be, observed, was, the, muon, discovered, by, carl, d, anderson, in, 1936, which, was, classified, as, a, meson, at, the, time, after, investigation, it, was, realized, that, the, muon, did, not, have, the, expected, properties, of, a, meson, but, rather, behaved, like, an, electron, only, with, higher, mass, it, took, until, 1947, for, the, concept, of, leptons, as, a, family, of, particles, to, be, proposed, the, first, neutrino, the, electron, neutrino, was, proposed, by, wolfgang, pauli, in, 1930, to, explain, certain, characteristics, of, beta, decay, it, was, first, observed, in, the, cowan, reines, neutrino, experiment, conducted, by, clyde, cowan, and, frederick, reines, in, 1956, the, muon, neutrino, was, discovered, in, 1962, by, leon, m, lederman, melvin, schwartz, and, jack, steinberger, and, the, tau, discovered, between, 1974, and, 1977, by, martin, lewis, perl, and, his, colleagues, from, the, stanford, linear, accelerator, center, and, lawrence, berkeley, national, laboratory, the, tau, neutrino, remained, elusive, until, july, 2000, when, the, donut, collaboration, from, fermilab, announced, its, discovery, leptons, are, an, important, part, of, the, standard, model, electrons, are, one, of, the, components, of, atoms, alongside, protons, and, neutrons, exotic, atoms, with, muons, and, taus, instead, of, electrons, can, also, be, synthesized, as, well, as, lepton, antilepton, particles, such, as, positronium, the, name, lepton, comes, from, the, greek, lept, s, fine, small, thin, neuter, nominative, accusative, singular, form, lept, n, the, earliest, attested, form, of, the, word, is, the, mycenaean, greek, re, po, to, written, in, linear, b, syllabic, script, lepton, was, first, used, by, physicist, l, on, rosenfeld, in, 1948, following, a, suggestion, of, prof, c, m, ller, i, adopt, as, a, pendant, to, nucleon, the, denomination, lepton, from, small, thin, delicate, to, denote, a, particle, of, small, mass, rosenfeld, chose, the, name, as, the, common, name, for, electrons, and, then, hypothesized, neutrinos, additionally, the, muon, initially, classified, as, a, meson, was, reclassified, as, a, lepton, in, the, 1950s, the, masses, of, those, particles, are, small, compared, to, nucleons, the, mass, of, an, electron, 0, 511, mev, c, 2, and, the, mass, of, a, muon, with, a, value, of, 105, 7, mev, c, 2, are, fractions, of, the, mass, of, the, heavy, proton, 938, 3, mev, c, 2, and, the, mass, of, a, neutrino, is, nearly, zero, however, the, mass, of, the, tau, discovered, in, the, mid, 1970s, 1777, mev, c, 2, is, nearly, twice, that, of, the, proton, and, 3477, times, that, of, the, electron, the, first, lepton, identified, was, the, electron, discovered, by, j, j, thomson, and, his, team, of, british, physicists, in, 1897, then, in, 1930, wolfgang, pauli, postulated, the, electron, neutrino, to, preserve, conservation, of, energy, conservation, of, momentum, and, conservation, of, angular, momentum, in, beta, decay, pauli, theorized, that, an, undetected, particle, was, carrying, away, the, difference, between, the, energy, momentum, and, angular, momentum, of, the, initial, and, observed, final, particles, the, electron, neutrino, was, simply, called, the, neutrino, as, it, was, not, yet, known, that, neutrinos, came, in, different, flavours, or, different, generations, nearly, 40, years, after, the, discovery, of, the, electron, the, muon, was, discovered, by, carl, d, anderson, in, 1936, due, to, its, mass, it, was, initially, categorized, as, a, meson, rather, than, a, lepton, it, later, became, clear, that, the, muon, was, much, more, similar, to, the, electron, than, to, mesons, as, muons, do, not, undergo, the, strong, interaction, and, thus, the, muon, was, reclassified, electrons, muons, and, the, electron, neutrino, were, grouped, into, a, new, group, of, particles, the, leptons, in, 1962, leon, m, lederman, melvin, schwartz, and, jack, steinberger, showed, that, more, than, one, type, of, neutrino, exists, by, first, detecting, interactions, of, the, muon, neutrino, which, earned, them, the, 1988, nobel, prize, although, by, then, the, different, flavours, of, neutrino, had, already, been, theorized, the, tau, was, first, detected, in, a, series, of, experiments, between, 1974, and, 1977, by, martin, lewis, perl, with, his, colleagues, at, the, slac, lbl, group, like, the, electron, and, the, muon, it, too, was, expected, to, have, an, associated, neutrino, the, first, evidence, for, tau, neutrinos, came, from, the, observation, of, missing, energy, and, momentum, in, tau, decay, analogous, to, the, missing, energy, and, momentum, in, beta, decay, leading, to, the, discovery, of, the, electron, neutrino, the, first, detection, of, tau, neutrino, interactions, was, announced, in, 2000, by, the, donut, collaboration, at, fermilab, making, it, the, second, to, latest, particle, of, the, standard, model, to, have, been, directly, observed, with, higgs, boson, being, discovered, in, 2012, although, all, present, data, is, consistent, with, three, generations, of, leptons, some, particle, physicists, are, searching, for, a, fourth, generation, the, current, lower, limit, on, the, mass, of, such, a, fourth, charged, lepton, is, 100, 8, gev, c, 2, while, its, associated, neutrino, would, have, a, mass, of, at, least, 45, 0, gev, c, 2, leptons, are, spin, 1, 2, particles, the, spin, statistics, theorem, thus, implies, that, they, are, fermions, and, thus, that, they, are, subject, to, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, no, two, leptons, of, the, same, species, can, be, in, the, same, state, at, the, same, time, furthermore, it, means, that, a, lepton, can, have, only, two, possible, spin, states, namely, up, or, down, a, closely, related, property, is, chirality, which, in, turn, is, closely, related, to, a, more, easily, visualized, property, called, helicity, the, helicity, of, a, particle, is, the, direction, of, its, spin, relative, to, its, momentum, particles, with, spin, in, the, same, direction, as, their, momentum, are, called, right, handed, and, they, are, otherwise, called, left, handed, when, a, particle, is, massless, the, direction, of, its, momentum, relative, to, its, spin, is, the, same, in, every, reference, frame, whereas, for, massive, particles, it, is, possible, to, overtake, the, particle, by, choosing, a, faster, moving, reference, frame, in, the, faster, frame, the, helicity, is, reversed, chirality, is, a, technical, property, defined, through, transformation, behaviour, under, the, poincar, group, that, does, not, change, with, reference, frame, it, is, contrived, to, agree, with, helicity, for, massless, particles, and, is, still, well, defined, for, particles, with, mass, in, many, quantum, field, theories, such, as, quantum, electrodynamics, and, quantum, chromodynamics, left, and, right, handed, fermions, are, identical, however, the, standard, model, s, weak, interaction, treats, left, handed, and, right, handed, fermions, differently, only, left, handed, fermions, and, right, handed, anti, fermions, participate, in, the, weak, interaction, this, is, an, example, of, parity, violation, explicitly, written, into, the, model, in, the, literature, left, handed, fields, are, often, denoted, by, a, capital, l, subscript, e, g, the, normal, electron, e, l, and, right, handed, fields, are, denoted, by, a, capital, r, subscript, e, g, a, positron, e, r, right, handed, neutrinos, and, left, handed, anti, neutrinos, have, no, possible, interaction, with, other, particles, see, sterile, neutrino, and, so, are, not, a, functional, part, of, the, standard, model, although, their, exclusion, is, not, a, strict, requirement, they, are, sometimes, listed, in, particle, tables, to, emphasize, that, they, would, have, no, active, role, if, included, in, the, model, even, though, electrically, charged, right, handed, particles, electron, muon, or, tau, do, not, engage, in, the, weak, interaction, specifically, they, can, still, interact, electrically, and, hence, still, participate, in, the, combined, electroweak, force, although, with, different, strengths, y, w, one, of, the, most, prominent, properties, of, leptons, is, their, electric, charge, q, the, electric, charge, determines, the, strength, of, their, electromagnetic, interactions, it, determines, the, strength, of, the, electric, field, generated, by, the, particle, see, coulomb, s, law, and, how, strongly, the, particle, reacts, to, an, external, electric, or, magnetic, field, see, lorentz, force, each, generation, contains, one, lepton, with, q, 1, e, and, one, lepton, with, zero, electric, charge, the, lepton, with, electric, charge, is, commonly, simply, referred, to, as, a, charged, lepton, while, a, neutral, lepton, is, called, a, neutrino, for, example, the, first, generation, consists, of, the, electron, e, with, a, negative, electric, charge, and, the, electrically, neutral, electron, neutrino, e, in, the, language, of, quantum, field, theory, the, electromagnetic, interaction, of, the, charged, leptons, is, expressed, by, the, fact, that, the, particles, interact, with, the, quantum, of, the, electromagnetic, field, the, photon, the, feynman, diagram, of, the, electron, photon, interaction, is, shown, on, the, right, because, leptons, possess, an, intrinsic, rotation, in, the, form, of, their, spin, charged, leptons, generate, a, magnetic, field, the, size, of, their, magnetic, dipole, moment, is, given, by, where, m, is, the, mass, of, the, lepton, and, g, is, the, so, called, g, factor, for, the, lepton, first, order, quantum, mechanical, approximation, predicts, that, the, g, factor, is, 2, for, all, leptons, however, higher, order, quantum, effects, caused, by, loops, in, feynman, diagrams, introduce, corrections, to, this, value, these, corrections, referred, to, as, the, anomalous, magnetic, dipole, moment, are, very, sensitive, to, the, details, of, a, quantum, field, theory, model, and, thus, provide, the, opportunity, for, precision, tests, of, the, standard, model, the, theoretical, and, measured, values, for, the, electron, anomalous, magnetic, dipole, moment, are, within, agreement, within, eight, significant, figures, the, results, for, the, muon, however, are, problematic, hinting, at, a, small, persistent, discrepancy, between, the, standard, model, and, experiment, in, the, standard, model, the, left, handed, charged, lepton, and, the, left, handed, neutrino, are, arranged, in, doublet, that, transforms, in, the, spinor, representation, t, 1, 2, of, the, weak, isospin, su, 2, gauge, symmetry, this, means, that, these, particles, are, eigenstates, of, the, isospin, projection, t, 3, with, eigenvalues, 1, 2, and, 1, 2, respectively, in, the, meantime, the, right, handed, charged, lepton, transforms, as, a, weak, isospin, scalar, t, 0, and, thus, does, not, participate, in, the, weak, interaction, while, there, is, no, evidence, that, a, right, handed, neutrino, exists, at, all, the, higgs, mechanism, recombines, the, gauge, fields, of, the, weak, isospin, su, 2, and, the, weak, hypercharge, u, 1, symmetries, to, three, massive, vector, bosons, w, w, z, 0, mediating, the, weak, interaction, and, one, massless, vector, boson, the, photon, responsible, for, the, electromagnetic, interaction, the, electric, charge, q, can, be, calculated, from, the, isospin, projection, t, 3, and, weak, hypercharge, y, w, through, the, gell, mann, nishijima, formula, to, recover, the, observed, electric, charges, for, all, particles, the, left, handed, weak, isospin, doublet, el, e, l, must, thus, have, y, w, 1, while, the, right, handed, isospin, scalar, e, r, must, have, y, w, 2, the, interaction, of, the, leptons, with, the, massive, weak, interaction, vector, bosons, is, shown, in, the, figure, on, the, right, in, the, standard, model, each, lepton, starts, out, with, no, intrinsic, mass, the, charged, leptons, i, e, the, electron, muon, and, tau, obtain, an, effective, mass, through, interaction, with, the, higgs, field, but, the, neutrinos, remain, massless, for, technical, reasons, the, masslessness, of, the, neutrinos, implies, that, there, is, no, mixing, of, the, different, generations, of, charged, leptons, as, there, is, for, quarks, the, zero, mass, of, neutrino, is, in, close, agreement, with, current, direct, experimental, observations, of, the, mass, however, it, is, known, from, indirect, experiments, most, prominently, from, observed, neutrino, oscillations, that, neutrinos, have, to, have, a, nonzero, mass, probably, less, than, 2, ev, c, 2, this, implies, the, existence, of, physics, beyond, the, standard, model, the, currently, most, favoured, extension, is, the, so, called, seesaw, mechanism, which, would, explain, both, why, the, left, handed, neutrinos, are, so, light, compared, to, the, corresponding, charged, leptons, and, why, we, have, not, yet, seen, any, right, handed, neutrinos, the, members, of, each, generation, s, weak, isospin, doublet, are, assigned, leptonic, numbers, that, are, conserved, under, the, standard, model, electrons, and, electron, neutrinos, have, an, electronic, number, of, l, e, 1, while, muons, and, muon, neutrinos, have, a, muonic, number, of, l, 1, while, tau, particles, and, tau, neutrinos, have, a, tauonic, number, of, l, 1, the, antileptons, have, their, respective, generation, s, leptonic, numbers, of, 1, conservation, of, the, leptonic, numbers, means, that, the, number, of, leptons, of, the, same, type, remains, the, same, when, particles, interact, this, implies, that, leptons, and, antileptons, must, be, created, in, pairs, of, a, single, generation, for, example, the, following, processes, are, allowed, under, conservation, of, leptonic, numbers, but, none, of, these, however, neutrino, oscillations, are, known, to, violate, the, conservation, of, the, individual, leptonic, numbers, such, a, violation, is, considered, to, be, smoking, gun, evidence, for, physics, beyond, the, standard, model, a, much, stronger, conservation, law, is, the, conservation, of, the, total, number, of, leptons, l, with, no, subscript, conserved, even, in, the, case, of, neutrino, oscillations, but, even, it, is, still, violated, by, a, tiny, amount, by, the, chiral, anomaly, the, coupling, of, leptons, to, all, types, of, gauge, boson, are, flavour, independent, the, interaction, between, leptons, and, a, gauge, boson, measures, the, same, for, each, lepton, this, property, is, called, lepton, universality, and, has, been, tested, in, measurements, of, the, muon, and, tau, lifetimes, and, of, z, boson, partial, decay, widths, particularly, at, the, stanford, linear, collider, slc, and, large, electron, positron, collider, lep, experiments, 241, 243, 138, the, decay, rate, displaystyle, gamma, of, muons, through, the, process, e, e, is, approximately, given, by, an, expression, of, the, form, see, muon, decay, for, more, details, where, k, 2, is, some, constant, and, g, f, is, the, fermi, coupling, constant, the, decay, rate, of, tau, particles, through, the, process, e, e, is, given, by, an, expression, of, the, same, form, where, k, 3, is, some, other, constant, muon, tauon, universality, implies, that, k, 2, k, 3, on, the, other, hand, electron, muon, universality, implies, the, branching, ratios, for, the, electronic, mode, 17, 82, and, muonic, 17, 39, mode, of, tau, decay, are, not, equal, due, to, the, mass, difference, of, the, final, state, leptons, universality, also, accounts, for, the, ratio, of, muon, and, tau, lifetimes, the, lifetime, t, displaystyle, mathrm, t, ell, of, a, lepton, displaystyle, ell, with, displaystyle, ell, or, is, related, to, the, decay, rate, by, where, b, x, y, displaystyle, mathcal, b, x, rightarrow, y, denotes, the, branching, ratios, and, x, y, displaystyle, gamma, x, rightarrow, y, denotes, the, resonance, width, of, the, process, x, y, displaystyle, x, rightarrow, y, with, x, and, y, replaced, by, two, different, particles, from, e, or, or, the, ratio, of, tau, and, muon, lifetime, is, thus, given, by, using, values, from, the, 2008, review, of, particle, physics, for, the, branching, ratios, of, the, muon, and, tau, yields, a, lifetime, ratio, of, 1, 29, 10, 7, comparable, to, the, measured, lifetime, ratio, of, 1, 32, 10, 7, the, difference, is, due, to, k, 2, and, k, 3, not, actually, being, constants, they, depend, slightly, on, the, mass, of, leptons, involved, recent, tests, of, lepton, universality, in, b, meson, decays, performed, by, the, lhcb, babar, and, belle, experiments, have, shown, consistent, deviations, from, the, standard, model, predictions, however, the, combined, statistical, and, systematic, significance, is, not, yet, high, enough, to, claim, an, observation, of, new, physics, in, july, 2021, results, on, lepton, universality, have, been, published, testing, w, decays, previous, measurements, by, the, lep, had, given, a, slight, imbalance, but, the, new, measurement, by, the, atlas, collaboration, have, twice, the, precision, and, give, a, ratio, of, b, w, b, w, 0, 992, 0, 013, displaystyle, mathcal, b, w, rightarrow, tau, nu, tau, mathcal, b, w, rightarrow, mu, nu, mu, 0, 992, pm, 0, 013, which, agrees, with, the, standard, model, prediction, of, unity
