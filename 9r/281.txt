environmental, chemistry, is, the, scientific, study, of, the, chemical, and, biochemical, phenomena, that, occur, in, natural, places, it, should, not, be, confused, with, green, chemistry, which, seeks, to, reduce, potential, pollution, at, its, source, it, can, be, defined, as, the, study, of, the, sources, reactions, transport, effects, and, fates, of, chemical, species, in, the, air, soil, and, water, environments, and, the, effect, of, human, activity, and, biological, activity, on, these, environmental, chemistry, is, an, interdisciplinary, science, that, includes, atmospheric, aquatic, and, soil, chemistry, as, well, as, heavily, relying, on, analytical, chemistry, and, being, related, to, environmental, and, other, areas, of, science, environmental, chemistry, involves, first, understanding, how, the, uncontaminated, environment, works, which, chemicals, in, what, concentrations, are, present, naturally, and, with, what, effects, without, this, it, would, be, impossible, to, accurately, study, the, effects, humans, have, on, the, environment, through, the, release, of, chemicals, environmental, chemists, draw, on, a, range, of, concepts, from, chemistry, and, various, environmental, sciences, to, assist, in, their, study, of, what, is, happening, to, a, chemical, species, in, the, environment, important, general, concepts, from, chemistry, include, understanding, chemical, reactions, and, equations, solutions, units, sampling, and, analytical, techniques, a, contaminant, is, a, substance, present, in, nature, at, a, level, higher, than, fixed, levels, or, that, would, not, otherwise, be, there, this, may, be, due, to, human, activity, and, bioactivity, the, term, contaminant, is, often, used, interchangeably, with, pollutant, which, is, a, substance, that, has, a, detrimental, impact, on, the, surrounding, environment, whilst, a, contaminant, is, sometimes, defined, as, a, substance, present, in, the, environment, as, a, result, of, human, activity, but, without, harmful, effects, it, is, sometimes, the, case, that, toxic, or, harmful, effects, from, contamination, only, become, apparent, at, a, later, date, the, medium, such, as, soil, or, organism, such, as, fish, affected, by, the, pollutant, or, contaminant, is, called, a, receptor, whilst, a, sink, is, a, chemical, medium, or, species, that, retains, and, interacts, with, the, pollutant, such, as, carbon, sink, and, its, effects, by, microbes, chemical, measures, of, water, quality, include, dissolved, oxygen, do, chemical, oxygen, demand, cod, biochemical, oxygen, demand, bod, total, dissolved, solids, tds, ph, nutrients, nitrates, and, phosphorus, heavy, metals, soil, chemicals, including, copper, zinc, cadmium, lead, and, mercury, and, pesticides, environmental, chemistry, is, used, by, the, environment, agency, in, england, natural, resources, wales, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, the, association, of, public, analysts, and, other, environmental, agencies, and, research, bodies, around, the, world, to, detect, and, identify, the, nature, and, source, of, pollutants, these, can, include, quantitative, chemical, analysis, is, a, key, part, of, environmental, chemistry, since, it, provides, the, data, that, frame, most, environmental, studies, common, analytical, techniques, used, for, quantitative, determinations, in, environmental, chemistry, include, classical, wet, chemistry, such, as, gravimetric, titrimetric, and, electrochemical, methods, more, sophisticated, approaches, are, used, in, the, determination, of, trace, metals, and, organic, compounds, metals, are, commonly, measured, by, atomic, spectroscopy, and, mass, spectrometry, atomic, absorption, spectrophotometry, aas, and, inductively, coupled, plasma, atomic, emission, icp, aes, or, inductively, coupled, plasma, mass, spectrometric, icp, ms, techniques, organic, compounds, including, pahs, are, commonly, measured, also, using, mass, spectrometric, methods, such, as, gas, chromatography, mass, spectrometry, gc, ms, and, liquid, chromatography, mass, spectrometry, lc, ms, tandem, mass, spectrometry, ms, ms, and, high, resolution, accurate, mass, spectrometry, hr, am, offer, sub, part, per, trillion, detection, non, ms, methods, using, gcs, and, lcs, having, universal, or, specific, detectors, are, still, staples, in, the, arsenal, of, available, analytical, tools, other, parameters, often, measured, in, environmental, chemistry, are, radiochemicals, these, are, pollutants, which, emit, radioactive, materials, such, as, alpha, and, beta, particles, posing, danger, to, human, health, and, the, environment, particle, counters, and, scintillation, counters, are, most, commonly, used, for, these, measurements, bioassays, and, immunoassays, are, utilized, for, toxicity, evaluations, of, chemical, effects, on, various, organisms, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, is, able, to, identify, species, of, bacteria, and, other, organisms, through, specific, dna, and, rna, gene, isolation, and, amplification, and, is, showing, promise, as, a, valuable, technique, for, identifying, environmental, microbial, contamination, peer, reviewed, test, methods, have, been, published, by, government, agencies, and, private, research, organizations, approved, published, methods, must, be, used, when, testing, to, demonstrate, compliance, with, regulatory, requirements, joan, berkowitz, paul, crutzen, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, 1995, philip, gschwend, alice, hamilton, john, m, hayes, charles,
