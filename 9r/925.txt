in, electromagnetism, an, eddy, current, also, called, foucault, s, current, is, a, loop, of, electric, current, induced, within, conductors, by, a, changing, magnetic, field, in, the, conductor, according, to, faraday, s, law, of, induction, or, by, the, relative, motion, of, a, conductor, in, a, magnetic, field, eddy, currents, flow, in, closed, loops, within, conductors, in, planes, perpendicular, to, the, magnetic, field, they, can, be, induced, within, nearby, stationary, conductors, by, a, time, varying, magnetic, field, created, by, an, ac, electromagnet, or, transformer, for, example, or, by, relative, motion, between, a, magnet, and, a, nearby, conductor, the, magnitude, of, the, current, in, a, given, loop, is, proportional, to, the, strength, of, the, magnetic, field, the, area, of, the, loop, and, the, rate, of, change, of, flux, and, inversely, proportional, to, the, resistivity, of, the, material, when, graphed, these, circular, currents, within, a, piece, of, metal, look, vaguely, like, eddies, or, whirlpools, in, a, liquid, by, lenz, s, law, an, eddy, current, creates, a, magnetic, field, that, opposes, the, change, in, the, magnetic, field, that, created, it, and, thus, eddy, currents, react, back, on, the, source, of, the, magnetic, field, for, example, a, nearby, conductive, surface, will, exert, a, drag, force, on, a, moving, magnet, that, opposes, its, motion, due, to, eddy, currents, induced, in, the, surface, by, the, moving, magnetic, field, this, effect, is, employed, in, eddy, current, brakes, which, are, used, to, stop, rotating, power, tools, quickly, when, they, are, turned, off, the, current, flowing, through, the, resistance, of, the, conductor, also, dissipates, energy, as, heat, in, the, material, thus, eddy, currents, are, a, cause, of, energy, loss, in, alternating, current, ac, inductors, transformers, electric, motors, and, generators, and, other, ac, machinery, requiring, special, construction, such, as, laminated, magnetic, cores, or, ferrite, cores, to, minimize, them, eddy, currents, are, also, used, to, heat, objects, in, induction, heating, furnaces, and, equipment, and, to, detect, cracks, and, flaws, in, metal, parts, using, eddy, current, testing, instruments, the, term, eddy, current, comes, from, analogous, currents, seen, in, water, in, fluid, dynamics, causing, localised, areas, of, turbulence, known, as, eddies, giving, rise, to, persistent, vortices, somewhat, analogously, eddy, currents, can, take, time, to, build, up, and, can, persist, for, very, long, times, in, conductors, due, to, their, inductance, the, first, person, to, observe, eddy, currents, was, fran, ois, arago, 1786, 1853, the, president, of, the, council, of, ministers, of, the, 2nd, french, republic, during, the, brief, period, 10th, may, to, june, 24, 1848, equivalent, to, the, current, position, of, the, french, prime, minister, who, was, also, a, mathematician, physicist, and, astronomer, in, 1824, he, observed, what, has, been, called, rotatory, magnetism, and, that, most, conductive, bodies, could, be, magnetized, these, discoveries, were, completed, and, explained, by, michael, faraday, 1791, 1867, in, 1834, emil, lenz, stated, lenz, s, law, which, says, that, the, direction, of, induced, current, flow, in, an, object, will, be, such, that, its, magnetic, field, will, oppose, the, change, of, magnetic, flux, that, caused, the, current, flow, eddy, currents, produce, a, secondary, field, that, cancels, a, part, of, the, external, field, and, causes, some, of, the, external, flux, to, avoid, the, conductor, french, physicist, l, on, foucault, 1819, 1868, is, credited, with, having, discovered, eddy, currents, in, september, 1855, he, discovered, that, the, force, required, for, the, rotation, of, a, copper, disc, becomes, greater, when, it, is, made, to, rotate, with, its, rim, between, the, poles, of, a, magnet, the, disc, at, the, same, time, becoming, heated, by, the, eddy, current, induced, in, the, metal, the, first, use, of, eddy, current, for, non, destructive, testing, occurred, in, 1879, when, david, e, hughes, used, the, principles, to, conduct, metallurgical, sorting, tests, a, magnet, induces, circular, electric, currents, in, a, metal, sheet, moving, through, its, magnetic, field, see, the, diagram, at, right, it, shows, a, metal, sheet, c, moving, to, the, right, with, velocity, v, under, a, stationary, magnet, the, magnetic, field, b, green, arrows, of, the, magnet, s, north, pole, n, passes, down, through, the, sheet, since, the, metal, is, moving, the, magnetic, flux, through, a, given, area, of, the, sheet, is, changing, in, the, part, of, the, sheet, moving, under, the, leading, edge, of, the, magnet, left, side, the, magnetic, field, through, a, given, point, on, the, sheet, is, increasing, as, it, gets, nearer, the, magnet, db, dt, 0, from, faraday, s, law, of, induction, this, creates, a, circular, electric, field, in, the, sheet, in, a, counterclockwise, direction, around, the, magnetic, field, lines, this, field, induces, a, counterclockwise, flow, of, electric, current, i, red, in, the, sheet, this, is, the, eddy, current, in, the, part, of, the, sheet, under, the, trailing, edge, of, the, magnet, right, side, the, magnetic, field, through, a, given, point, on, the, sheet, is, decreasing, as, it, is, moving, further, away, from, the, magnet, db, dt, 0, inducing, a, second, eddy, current, in, a, clockwise, direction, in, the, sheet, another, equivalent, way, to, understand, the, current, is, to, see, that, the, free, charge, carriers, electrons, in, the, metal, sheet, are, moving, with, the, sheet, to, the, right, so, the, magnetic, field, exerts, a, sideways, force, on, them, due, to, the, lorentz, force, since, the, velocity, v, of, the, charges, is, to, the, right, and, the, magnetic, field, b, is, directed, down, from, the, right, hand, rule, the, lorentz, force, on, positive, charges, f, q, v, b, is, toward, the, rear, of, the, diagram, to, the, left, when, facing, in, the, direction, of, motion, v, this, causes, a, current, i, toward, the, rear, under, the, magnet, which, circles, around, through, parts, of, the, sheet, outside, the, magnetic, field, clockwise, to, the, right, and, counterclockwise, to, the, left, to, the, front, of, the, magnet, again, the, mobile, charge, carriers, in, the, metal, the, electrons, actually, have, a, negative, charge, q, 0, so, their, motion, is, opposite, in, direction, to, the, conventional, current, shown, the, magnetic, field, of, the, magnet, acting, on, the, electrons, moving, sideways, under, the, magnet, then, exerts, a, lorentz, force, directed, to, the, rear, opposite, to, the, velocity, of, the, metal, sheet, the, electrons, in, collisions, with, the, metal, lattice, atoms, transfer, this, force, to, the, sheet, exerting, a, drag, force, on, the, sheet, proportional, to, its, velocity, the, kinetic, energy, which, is, consumed, overcoming, this, drag, force, is, dissipated, as, heat, by, the, currents, flowing, through, the, resistance, of, the, metal, so, the, metal, gets, warm, under, the, magnet, due, to, amp, re, s, circuital, law, each, of, the, circular, currents, in, the, sheet, creates, a, counter, magnetic, field, blue, arrows, another, way, to, understand, the, drag, force, is, to, see, that, due, to, lenz, s, law, the, counterfields, oppose, the, change, in, magnetic, field, through, the, sheet, at, the, leading, edge, of, the, magnet, left, side, by, the, right, hand, rule, the, counterclockwise, current, creates, a, magnetic, field, pointed, up, opposing, the, magnet, s, field, causing, a, repulsive, force, between, the, sheet, and, the, leading, edge, of, the, magnet, in, contrast, at, the, trailing, edge, right, side, the, clockwise, current, causes, a, magnetic, field, pointed, down, in, the, same, direction, as, the, magnet, s, field, creating, an, attractive, force, between, the, sheet, and, the, trailing, edge, of, the, magnet, both, of, these, forces, oppose, the, motion, of, the, sheet, eddy, currents, in, conductors, of, non, zero, resistivity, generate, heat, as, well, as, electromagnetic, forces, the, heat, can, be, used, for, induction, heating, the, electromagnetic, forces, can, be, used, for, levitation, creating, movement, or, to, give, a, strong, braking, effect, eddy, currents, can, also, have, undesirable, effects, for, instance, power, loss, in, transformers, in, this, application, they, are, minimized, with, thin, plates, by, lamination, of, conductors, or, other, details, of, conductor, shape, self, induced, eddy, currents, are, responsible, for, the, skin, effect, in, conductors, the, latter, can, be, used, for, non, destructive, testing, of, materials, for, geometry, features, like, micro, cracks, a, similar, effect, is, the, proximity, effect, which, is, caused, by, externally, induced, eddy, currents, an, object, or, part, of, an, object, experiences, steady, field, intensity, and, direction, where, there, is, still, relative, motion, of, the, field, and, the, object, for, example, in, the, center, of, the, field, in, the, diagram, or, unsteady, fields, where, the, currents, cannot, circulate, due, to, the, geometry, of, the, conductor, in, these, situations, charges, collect, on, or, within, the, object, and, these, charges, then, produce, static, electric, potentials, that, oppose, any, further, current, currents, may, be, initially, associated, with, the, creation, of, static, potentials, but, these, may, be, transitory, and, small, eddy, currents, generate, resistive, losses, that, transform, some, forms, of, energy, such, as, kinetic, energy, into, heat, this, joule, heating, reduces, efficiency, of, iron, core, transformers, and, electric, motors, and, other, devices, that, use, changing, magnetic, fields, eddy, currents, are, minimized, in, these, devices, by, selecting, magnetic, core, materials, that, have, low, electrical, conductivity, e, g, ferrites, or, iron, powder, mixed, with, resin, or, by, using, thin, sheets, of, magnetic, material, known, as, laminations, electrons, cannot, cross, the, insulating, gap, between, the, laminations, and, so, are, unable, to, circulate, on, wide, arcs, charges, gather, at, the, lamination, boundaries, in, a, process, analogous, to, the, hall, effect, producing, electric, fields, that, oppose, any, further, accumulation, of, charge, and, hence, suppressing, the, eddy, currents, the, shorter, the, distance, between, adjacent, laminations, i, e, the, greater, the, number, of, laminations, per, unit, area, perpendicular, to, the, applied, field, the, greater, the, suppression, of, eddy, currents, the, conversion, of, input, energy, to, heat, is, not, always, undesirable, however, as, there, are, some, practical, applications, one, is, in, the, brakes, of, some, trains, known, as, eddy, current, brakes, during, braking, the, metal, wheels, are, exposed, to, a, magnetic, field, from, an, electromagnet, generating, eddy, currents, in, the, wheels, this, eddy, current, is, formed, by, the, movement, of, the, wheels, so, by, lenz, s, law, the, magnetic, field, formed, by, the, eddy, current, will, oppose, its, cause, thus, the, wheel, will, face, a, force, opposing, the, initial, movement, of, the, wheel, the, faster, the, wheels, are, spinning, the, stronger, the, effect, meaning, that, as, the, train, slows, the, braking, force, is, reduced, producing, a, smooth, stopping, motion, induction, heating, makes, use, of, eddy, currents, to, provide, heating, of, metal, objects, under, certain, assumptions, uniform, material, uniform, magnetic, field, no, skin, effect, etc, the, power, lost, due, to, eddy, currents, per, unit, mass, for, a, thin, sheet, or, wire, can, be, calculated, from, the, following, equation, p, 2, b, p, 2, d, 2, f, 2, 6, k, d, displaystyle, p, frac, pi, 2, b, text, p, 2, d, 2, f, 2, 6k, rho, d, where, this, equation, is, valid, only, under, the, so, called, quasi, static, conditions, where, the, frequency, of, magnetisation, does, not, result, in, the, skin, effect, that, is, the, electromagnetic, wave, fully, penetrates, the, material, in, very, fast, changing, fields, the, magnetic, field, does, not, penetrate, completely, into, the, interior, of, the, material, this, skin, effect, renders, the, above, equation, invalid, however, in, any, case, increased, frequency, of, the, same, value, of, field, will, always, increase, eddy, currents, even, with, non, uniform, field, penetration, the, penetration, depth, for, a, good, conductor, can, be, calculated, from, the, following, equation, 1, f, displaystyle, delta, frac, 1, sqrt, pi, f, mu, sigma, where, is, the, penetration, depth, m, f, is, the, frequency, hz, is, the, magnetic, permeability, of, the, material, h, m, and, is, the, electrical, conductivity, of, the, material, s, m, the, derivation, of, a, useful, equation, for, modelling, the, effect, of, eddy, currents, in, a, material, starts, with, the, differential, magnetostatic, form, of, amp, re, s, law, providing, an, expression, for, the, magnetizing, field, h, surrounding, a, current, density, j, h, j, displaystyle, nabla, times, mathbf, h, mathbf, j, taking, the, curl, on, both, sides, of, this, equation, and, then, using, a, common, vector, calculus, identity, for, the, curl, of, the, curl, results, in, h, 2, h, j, displaystyle, nabla, left, nabla, cdot, mathbf, h, right, nabla, 2, mathbf, h, nabla, times, mathbf, j, from, gauss, s, law, for, magnetism, h, 0, so, 2, h, j, displaystyle, nabla, 2, mathbf, h, nabla, times, mathbf, j, using, ohm, s, law, j, e, which, relates, current, density, j, to, electric, field, e, in, terms, of, a, material, s, conductivity, and, assuming, isotropic, homogeneous, conductivity, the, equation, can, be, written, as, 2, h, e, displaystyle, nabla, 2, mathbf, h, sigma, nabla, times, mathbf, e, using, the, differential, form, of, faraday, s, law, e, b, t, this, gives, 2, h, b, t, displaystyle, nabla, 2, mathbf, h, sigma, frac, partial, mathbf, b, partial, t, by, definition, b, 0, h, m, where, m, is, the, magnetization, of, the, material, and, 0, is, the, vacuum, permeability, the, diffusion, equation, therefore, is, 2, h, 0, m, t, h, t, displaystyle, nabla, 2, mathbf, h, mu, 0, sigma, left, frac, partial, mathbf, m, partial, t, frac, partial, mathbf, h, partial, t, right, eddy, current, brakes, use, the, drag, force, created, by, eddy, currents, as, a, brake, to, slow, or, stop, moving, objects, since, there, is, no, contact, with, a, brake, shoe, or, drum, there, is, no, mechanical, wear, however, an, eddy, current, brake, cannot, provide, a, holding, torque, and, so, may, be, used, in, combination, with, mechanical, brakes, for, example, on, overhead, cranes, another, application, is, on, some, roller, coasters, where, heavy, copper, plates, extending, from, the, car, are, moved, between, pairs, of, very, strong, permanent, magnets, electrical, resistance, within, the, plates, causes, a, dragging, effect, analogous, to, friction, which, dissipates, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, car, the, same, technique, is, used, in, electromagnetic, brakes, in, railroad, cars, and, to, quickly, stop, the, blades, in, power, tools, such, as, circular, saws, using, electromagnets, as, opposed, to, permanent, magnets, the, strength, of, the, magnetic, field, can, be, adjusted, and, so, the, magnitude, of, braking, effect, changed, in, a, varying, magnetic, field, the, induced, currents, exhibit, diamagnetic, like, repulsion, effects, a, conductive, object, will, experience, a, repulsion, force, this, can, lift, objects, against, gravity, though, with, continual, power, input, to, replace, the, energy, dissipated, by, the, eddy, currents, an, example, application, is, separation, of, aluminum, cans, from, other, metals, in, an, eddy, current, separator, ferrous, metals, cling, to, the, magnet, and, aluminum, and, other, non, ferrous, conductors, are, forced, away, from, the, magnet, this, can, separate, a, waste, stream, into, ferrous, and, non, ferrous, scrap, metal, with, a, very, strong, handheld, magnet, such, as, those, made, from, neodymium, one, can, easily, observe, a, very, similar, effect, by, rapidly, sweeping, the, magnet, over, a, coin, with, only, a, small, separation, depending, on, the, strength, of, the, magnet, identity, of, the, coin, and, separation, between, the, magnet, and, coin, one, may, induce, the, coin, to, be, pushed, slightly, ahead, of, the, magnet, even, if, the, coin, contains, no, magnetic, elements, such, as, the, us, penny, another, example, involves, dropping, a, strong, magnet, down, a, tube, of, copper, the, magnet, falls, at, a, dramatically, slow, pace, in, a, perfect, conductor, with, no, resistance, surface, eddy, currents, exactly, cancel, the, field, inside, the, conductor, so, no, magnetic, field, penetrates, the, conductor, since, no, energy, is, lost, in, resistance, eddy, currents, created, when, a, magnet, is, brought, near, the, conductor, persist, even, after, the, magnet, is, stationary, and, can, exactly, balance, the, force, of, gravity, allowing, magnetic, levitation, superconductors, also, exhibit, a, separate, inherently, quantum, mechanical, phenomenon, called, the, meissner, effect, in, which, any, magnetic, field, lines, present, in, the, material, when, it, becomes, superconducting, are, expelled, thus, the, magnetic, field, in, a, superconductor, is, always, zero, using, electromagnets, with, electronic, switching, comparable, to, electronic, speed, control, it, is, possible, to, generate, electromagnetic, fields, moving, in, an, arbitrary, direction, as, described, in, the, section, above, about, eddy, current, brakes, a, non, ferromagnetic, conductor, surface, tends, to, rest, within, this, moving, field, when, however, this, field, is, moving, a, vehicle, can, be, levitated, and, propelled, this, is, comparable, to, a, maglev, but, is, not, bound, to, a, rail, in, some, coin, operated, vending, machines, eddy, currents, are, used, to, detect, counterfeit, coins, or, slugs, the, coin, rolls, past, a, stationary, magnet, and, eddy, currents, slow, its, speed, the, strength, of, the, eddy, currents, and, thus, the, retardation, depends, on, the, conductivity, of, the, coin, s, metal, slugs, are, slowed, to, a, different, degree, than, genuine, coins, and, this, is, used, to, send, them, into, the, rejection, slot, eddy, currents, are, used, in, certain, types, of, proximity, sensors, to, observe, the, vibration, and, position, of, rotating, shafts, within, their, bearings, this, technology, was, originally, pioneered, in, the, 1930s, by, researchers, at, general, electric, using, vacuum, tube, circuitry, in, the, late, 1950s, solid, state, versions, were, developed, by, donald, e, bently, at, bently, nevada, corporation, these, sensors, are, extremely, sensitive, to, very, small, displacements, making, them, well, suited, to, observe, the, minute, vibrations, on, the, order, of, several, thousandths, of, an, inch, in, modern, turbomachinery, a, typical, proximity, sensor, used, for, vibration, monitoring, has, a, scale, factor, of, 200, mv, mil, widespread, use, of, such, sensors, in, turbomachinery, has, led, to, development, of, industry, standards, that, prescribe, their, use, and, application, examples, of, such, standards, are, american, petroleum, institute, api, standard, 670, and, iso, 7919, a, ferraris, acceleration, sensor, also, called, a, ferraris, sensor, is, a, contactless, sensor, that, uses, eddy, currents, to, measure, relative, acceleration, eddy, current, techniques, are, commonly, used, for, the, nondestructive, examination, nde, and, condition, monitoring, of, a, large, variety, of, metallic, structures, including, heat, exchanger, tubes, aircraft, fuselage, and, aircraft, structural, components, eddy, currents, are, the, root, cause, of, the, skin, effect, in, conductors, carrying, alternating, current, similarly, in, magnetic, materials, of, finite, conductivity, eddy, currents, cause, the, confinement, of, the, majority, of, the, magnetic, fields, to, only, a, couple, skin, depths, of, the, surface, of, the, material, this, effect, limits, the, flux, linkage, in, inductors, and, transformers, having, magnetic, cores
