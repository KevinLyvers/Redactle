in, electrical, engineering, impedance, is, the, opposition, to, alternating, current, presented, by, the, combined, effect, of, resistance, and, reactance, in, a, circuit, quantitatively, the, impedance, of, a, two, terminal, circuit, element, is, the, ratio, of, the, complex, representation, of, the, sinusoidal, voltage, between, its, terminals, to, the, complex, representation, of, the, current, flowing, through, it, in, general, it, depends, upon, the, frequency, of, the, sinusoidal, voltage, impedance, extends, the, concept, of, resistance, to, alternating, current, ac, circuits, and, possesses, both, magnitude, and, phase, unlike, resistance, which, has, only, magnitude, impedance, can, be, represented, as, a, complex, number, with, the, same, units, as, resistance, for, which, the, si, unit, is, the, ohm, its, symbol, is, usually, z, and, it, may, be, represented, by, writing, its, magnitude, and, phase, in, the, polar, form, z, however, cartesian, complex, number, representation, is, often, more, powerful, for, circuit, analysis, purposes, the, notion, of, impedance, is, useful, for, performing, ac, analysis, of, electrical, networks, because, it, allows, relating, sinusoidal, voltages, and, currents, by, a, simple, linear, law, in, multiple, port, networks, the, two, terminal, definition, of, impedance, is, inadequate, but, the, complex, voltages, at, the, ports, and, the, currents, flowing, through, them, are, still, linearly, related, by, the, impedance, matrix, the, reciprocal, of, impedance, is, admittance, whose, si, unit, is, the, siemens, formerly, called, mho, instruments, used, to, measure, the, electrical, impedance, are, called, impedance, analyzers, perhaps, the, earliest, use, of, complex, numbers, in, circuit, analysis, was, by, johann, victor, wietlisbach, in, 1879, in, analysing, the, maxwell, bridge, wietlisbach, avoided, using, differential, equations, by, expressing, ac, currents, and, voltages, as, exponential, functions, with, imaginary, exponents, see, validity, of, complex, representation, wietlisbach, found, the, required, voltage, was, given, by, multiplying, the, current, by, a, complex, number, impedance, although, he, did, not, identify, this, as, a, general, parameter, in, its, own, right, the, term, impedance, was, coined, by, oliver, heaviside, in, july, 1886, heaviside, recognised, that, the, resistance, operator, impedance, in, his, operational, calculus, was, a, complex, number, in, 1887, he, showed, that, there, was, an, ac, equivalent, to, ohm, s, law, arthur, kennelly, published, an, influential, paper, on, impedance, in, 1893, kennelly, arrived, at, a, complex, number, representation, in, a, rather, more, direct, way, than, using, imaginary, exponential, functions, kennelly, followed, the, graphical, representation, of, impedance, showing, resistance, reactance, and, impedance, as, the, lengths, of, the, sides, of, a, right, angle, triangle, developed, by, john, ambrose, fleming, in, 1889, impedances, could, thus, be, added, vectorially, kennelly, realised, that, this, graphical, representation, of, impedance, was, directly, analogous, to, graphical, representation, of, complex, numbers, argand, diagram, problems, in, impedance, calculation, could, thus, be, approached, algebraically, with, a, complex, number, representation, later, that, same, year, kennelly, s, work, was, generalised, to, all, ac, circuits, by, charles, proteus, steinmetz, steinmetz, not, only, represented, impedances, by, complex, numbers, but, also, voltages, and, currents, unlike, kennelly, steinmetz, was, thus, able, to, express, ac, equivalents, of, dc, laws, such, as, ohm, s, and, kirchhoff, s, laws, steinmetz, s, work, was, highly, influential, in, spreading, the, technique, amongst, engineers, in, addition, to, resistance, as, seen, in, dc, circuits, impedance, in, ac, circuits, includes, the, effects, of, the, induction, of, voltages, in, conductors, by, the, magnetic, fields, inductance, and, the, electrostatic, storage, of, charge, induced, by, voltages, between, conductors, capacitance, the, impedance, caused, by, these, two, effects, is, collectively, referred, to, as, reactance, and, forms, the, imaginary, part, of, complex, impedance, whereas, resistance, forms, the, real, part, the, impedance, of, a, two, terminal, circuit, element, is, represented, as, a, complex, quantity, z, displaystyle, z, the, polar, form, conveniently, captures, both, magnitude, and, phase, characteristics, as, where, the, magnitude, z, displaystyle, z, represents, the, ratio, of, the, voltage, difference, amplitude, to, the, current, amplitude, while, the, argument, arg, z, displaystyle, arg, z, commonly, given, the, symbol, displaystyle, theta, gives, the, phase, difference, between, voltage, and, current, j, displaystyle, j, is, the, imaginary, unit, and, is, used, instead, of, i, displaystyle, i, in, this, context, to, avoid, confusion, with, the, symbol, for, electric, current, 21, in, cartesian, form, impedance, is, defined, as, where, the, real, part, of, impedance, is, the, resistance, r, and, the, imaginary, part, is, the, reactance, x, where, it, is, needed, to, add, or, subtract, impedances, the, cartesian, form, is, more, convenient, but, when, quantities, are, multiplied, or, divided, the, calculation, becomes, simpler, if, the, polar, form, is, used, a, circuit, calculation, such, as, finding, the, total, impedance, of, two, impedances, in, parallel, may, require, conversion, between, forms, several, times, during, the, calculation, conversion, between, the, forms, follows, the, normal, conversion, rules, of, complex, numbers, to, simplify, calculations, sinusoidal, voltage, and, current, waves, are, commonly, represented, as, complex, valued, functions, of, time, denoted, as, v, displaystyle, v, and, i, displaystyle, i, the, impedance, of, a, bipolar, circuit, is, defined, as, the, ratio, of, these, quantities, hence, denoting, v, i, displaystyle, theta, phi, v, phi, i, we, have, the, magnitude, equation, is, the, familiar, ohm, s, law, applied, to, the, voltage, and, current, amplitudes, while, the, second, equation, defines, the, phase, relationship, this, representation, using, complex, exponentials, may, be, justified, by, noting, that, by, euler, s, formula, the, real, valued, sinusoidal, function, representing, either, voltage, or, current, may, be, broken, into, two, complex, valued, functions, by, the, principle, of, superposition, we, may, analyse, the, behaviour, of, the, sinusoid, on, the, left, hand, side, by, analysing, the, behaviour, of, the, two, complex, terms, on, the, right, hand, side, given, the, symmetry, we, only, need, to, perform, the, analysis, for, one, right, hand, term, the, results, are, identical, for, the, other, at, the, end, of, any, calculation, we, may, return, to, real, valued, sinusoids, by, further, noting, that, the, meaning, of, electrical, impedance, can, be, understood, by, substituting, it, into, ohm, s, law, assuming, a, two, terminal, circuit, element, with, impedance, z, displaystyle, z, is, driven, by, a, sinusoidal, voltage, or, current, as, above, there, holds, the, magnitude, of, the, impedance, z, displaystyle, z, acts, just, like, resistance, giving, the, drop, in, voltage, amplitude, across, an, impedance, z, displaystyle, z, for, a, given, current, i, displaystyle, i, the, phase, factor, tells, us, that, the, current, lags, the, voltage, by, a, phase, arg, z, displaystyle, theta, arg, z, i, e, in, the, time, domain, the, current, signal, is, shifted, 2, t, textstyle, frac, theta, 2, pi, t, later, with, respect, to, the, voltage, signal, just, as, impedance, extends, ohm, s, law, to, cover, ac, circuits, other, results, from, dc, circuit, analysis, such, as, voltage, division, current, division, th, venin, s, theorem, and, norton, s, theorem, can, also, be, extended, to, ac, circuits, by, replacing, resistance, with, impedance, a, phasor, is, represented, by, a, constant, complex, number, usually, expressed, in, exponential, form, representing, the, complex, amplitude, magnitude, and, phase, of, a, sinusoidal, function, of, time, phasors, are, used, by, electrical, engineers, to, simplify, computations, involving, sinusoids, such, as, in, ac, circuits, 53, where, they, can, often, reduce, a, differential, equation, problem, to, an, algebraic, one, the, impedance, of, a, circuit, element, can, be, defined, as, the, ratio, of, the, phasor, voltage, across, the, element, to, the, phasor, current, through, the, element, as, determined, by, the, relative, amplitudes, and, phases, of, the, voltage, and, current, this, is, identical, to, the, definition, from, ohm, s, law, given, above, recognising, that, the, factors, of, e, j, t, displaystyle, e, j, omega, t, cancel, the, impedance, of, an, ideal, resistor, is, purely, real, and, is, called, resistive, impedance, in, this, case, the, voltage, and, current, waveforms, are, proportional, and, in, phase, ideal, inductors, and, capacitors, have, a, purely, imaginary, reactive, impedance, the, impedance, of, inductors, increases, as, frequency, increases, the, impedance, of, capacitors, decreases, as, frequency, increases, in, both, cases, for, an, applied, sinusoidal, voltage, the, resulting, current, is, also, sinusoidal, but, in, quadrature, 90, degrees, out, of, phase, with, the, voltage, however, the, phases, have, opposite, signs, in, an, inductor, the, current, is, lagging, in, a, capacitor, the, current, is, leading, note, the, following, identities, for, the, imaginary, unit, and, its, reciprocal, thus, the, inductor, and, capacitor, impedance, equations, can, be, rewritten, in, polar, form, the, magnitude, gives, the, change, in, voltage, amplitude, for, a, given, current, amplitude, through, the, impedance, while, the, exponential, factors, give, the, phase, relationship, what, follows, below, is, a, derivation, of, impedance, for, each, of, the, three, basic, circuit, elements, the, resistor, the, capacitor, and, the, inductor, although, the, idea, can, be, extended, to, define, the, relationship, between, the, voltage, and, current, of, any, arbitrary, signal, these, derivations, assume, sinusoidal, signals, in, fact, this, applies, to, any, arbitrary, periodic, signals, because, these, can, be, approximated, as, a, sum, of, sinusoids, through, fourier, analysis, for, a, resistor, there, is, the, relation, which, is, ohm, s, law, considering, the, voltage, signal, to, be, it, follows, that, this, says, that, the, ratio, of, ac, voltage, amplitude, to, alternating, current, ac, amplitude, across, a, resistor, is, r, displaystyle, r, and, that, the, ac, voltage, leads, the, current, across, a, resistor, by, 0, degrees, this, result, is, commonly, expressed, as, for, a, capacitor, there, is, the, relation, considering, the, voltage, signal, to, be, it, follows, that, and, thus, as, previously, conversely, if, the, current, through, the, circuit, is, assumed, to, be, sinusoidal, its, complex, representation, being, then, integrating, the, differential, equation, leads, to, the, const, term, represents, a, fixed, potential, bias, superimposed, to, the, ac, sinusoidal, potential, that, plays, no, role, in, ac, analysis, for, this, purpose, this, term, can, be, assumed, to, be, 0, hence, again, the, impedance, for, the, inductor, we, have, the, relation, from, faraday, s, law, this, time, considering, the, current, signal, to, be, it, follows, that, this, result, is, commonly, expressed, in, polar, form, as, or, using, euler, s, formula, as, as, in, the, case, of, capacitors, it, is, also, possible, to, derive, this, formula, directly, from, the, complex, representations, of, the, voltages, and, currents, or, by, assuming, a, sinusoidal, voltage, between, the, two, poles, of, the, inductor, in, the, latter, case, integrating, the, differential, equation, above, leads, to, a, constant, term, for, the, current, that, represents, a, fixed, dc, bias, flowing, through, the, inductor, this, is, set, to, zero, because, ac, analysis, using, frequency, domain, impedance, considers, one, frequency, at, a, time, and, dc, represents, a, separate, frequency, of, zero, hertz, in, this, context, impedance, defined, in, terms, of, j, can, strictly, be, applied, only, to, circuits, that, are, driven, with, a, steady, state, ac, signal, the, concept, of, impedance, can, be, extended, to, a, circuit, energised, with, any, arbitrary, signal, by, using, complex, frequency, instead, of, j, complex, frequency, is, given, the, symbol, s, and, is, in, general, a, complex, number, signals, are, expressed, in, terms, of, complex, frequency, by, taking, the, laplace, transform, of, the, time, domain, expression, of, the, signal, the, impedance, of, the, basic, circuit, elements, in, this, more, general, notation, is, as, follows, for, a, dc, circuit, this, simplifies, to, s, 0, for, a, steady, state, sinusoidal, ac, signal, s, j, the, impedance, z, displaystyle, z, of, an, electrical, component, is, defined, as, the, ratio, between, the, laplace, transforms, of, the, voltage, over, it, and, the, current, through, it, i, e, where, s, j, displaystyle, s, sigma, j, omega, is, the, complex, laplace, parameter, as, an, example, according, to, the, i, v, law, of, a, capacitor, l, i, t, l, c, d, v, t, d, t, s, c, l, v, t, displaystyle, mathcal, l, i, t, mathcal, l, c, mathrm, d, v, t, mathrm, d, t, sc, mathcal, l, v, t, from, which, it, follows, that, z, c, s, 1, s, c, displaystyle, z, c, s, 1, sc, in, the, phasor, regime, steady, state, ac, meaning, all, signals, are, represented, mathematically, as, simple, complex, exponentials, v, t, v, e, j, t, displaystyle, v, t, hat, v, e, j, omega, t, and, i, t, i, e, j, t, displaystyle, i, t, hat, i, e, j, omega, t, oscillating, at, a, common, frequency, displaystyle, omega, impedance, can, simply, be, calculated, as, the, voltage, to, current, ratio, in, which, the, common, time, dependent, factor, cancels, out, again, for, a, capacitor, one, gets, that, i, t, c, d, v, t, d, t, j, c, v, t, displaystyle, i, t, c, mathrm, d, v, t, mathrm, d, t, j, omega, c, v, t, and, hence, z, c, 1, j, c, displaystyle, z, c, omega, 1, j, omega, c, the, phasor, domain, is, sometimes, dubbed, the, frequency, domain, although, it, lacks, one, of, the, dimensions, of, the, laplace, parameter, for, steady, state, ac, the, polar, form, of, the, complex, impedance, relates, the, amplitude, and, phase, of, the, voltage, and, current, in, particular, these, two, relationships, hold, even, after, taking, the, real, part, of, the, complex, exponentials, see, phasors, which, is, the, part, of, the, signal, one, actually, measures, in, real, life, circuits, resistance, and, reactance, together, determine, the, magnitude, and, phase, of, the, impedance, through, the, following, relations, in, many, applications, the, relative, phase, of, the, voltage, and, current, is, not, critical, so, only, the, magnitude, of, the, impedance, is, significant, resistance, r, displaystyle, r, is, the, real, part, of, impedance, a, device, with, a, purely, resistive, impedance, exhibits, no, phase, shift, between, the, voltage, and, current, reactance, x, displaystyle, x, is, the, imaginary, part, of, the, impedance, a, component, with, a, finite, reactance, induces, a, phase, shift, displaystyle, theta, between, the, voltage, across, it, and, the, current, through, it, a, purely, reactive, component, is, distinguished, by, the, sinusoidal, voltage, across, the, component, being, in, quadrature, with, the, sinusoidal, current, through, the, component, this, implies, that, the, component, alternately, absorbs, energy, from, the, circuit, and, then, returns, energy, to, the, circuit, a, pure, reactance, does, not, dissipate, any, power, a, capacitor, has, a, purely, reactive, impedance, that, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, signal, frequency, a, capacitor, consists, of, two, conductors, separated, by, an, insulator, also, known, as, a, dielectric, the, minus, sign, indicates, that, the, imaginary, part, of, the, impedance, is, negative, at, low, frequencies, a, capacitor, approaches, an, open, circuit, so, no, current, flows, through, it, a, dc, voltage, applied, across, a, capacitor, causes, charge, to, accumulate, on, one, side, the, electric, field, due, to, the, accumulated, charge, is, the, source, of, the, opposition, to, the, current, when, the, potential, associated, with, the, charge, exactly, balances, the, applied, voltage, the, current, goes, to, zero, driven, by, an, ac, supply, a, capacitor, accumulates, only, a, limited, charge, before, the, potential, difference, changes, sign, and, the, charge, dissipates, the, higher, the, frequency, the, less, charge, accumulates, and, the, smaller, the, opposition, to, the, current, inductive, reactance, x, l, displaystyle, x, l, is, proportional, to, the, signal, frequency, f, displaystyle, f, and, the, inductance, l, displaystyle, l, an, inductor, consists, of, a, coiled, conductor, faraday, s, law, of, electromagnetic, induction, gives, the, back, emf, e, displaystyle, mathcal, e, voltage, opposing, current, due, to, a, rate, of, change, of, magnetic, flux, density, b, displaystyle, b, through, a, current, loop, for, an, inductor, consisting, of, a, coil, with, n, displaystyle, n, loops, this, gives, the, back, emf, is, the, source, of, the, opposition, to, current, flow, a, constant, direct, current, has, a, zero, rate, of, change, and, sees, an, inductor, as, a, short, circuit, it, is, typically, made, from, a, material, with, a, low, resistivity, an, alternating, current, has, a, time, averaged, rate, of, change, that, is, proportional, to, frequency, this, causes, the, increase, in, inductive, reactance, with, frequency, the, total, reactance, is, given, by, so, that, the, total, impedance, is, the, total, impedance, of, many, simple, networks, of, components, can, be, calculated, using, the, rules, for, combining, impedances, in, series, and, parallel, the, rules, are, identical, to, those, for, combining, resistances, except, that, the, numbers, in, general, are, complex, numbers, the, general, case, however, requires, equivalent, impedance, transforms, in, addition, to, series, and, parallel, for, components, connected, in, series, the, current, through, each, circuit, element, is, the, same, the, total, impedance, is, the, sum, of, the, component, impedances, or, explicitly, in, real, and, imaginary, terms, for, components, connected, in, parallel, the, voltage, across, each, circuit, element, is, the, same, the, ratio, of, currents, through, any, two, elements, is, the, inverse, ratio, of, their, impedances, hence, the, inverse, total, impedance, is, the, sum, of, the, inverses, of, the, component, impedances, or, when, n, 2, the, equivalent, impedance, z, eq, displaystyle, z, text, eq, can, be, calculated, in, terms, of, the, equivalent, series, resistance, r, eq, displaystyle, r, text, eq, and, reactance, x, eq, displaystyle, x, text, eq, the, measurement, of, the, impedance, of, devices, and, transmission, lines, is, a, practical, problem, in, radio, technology, and, other, fields, measurements, of, impedance, may, be, carried, out, at, one, frequency, or, the, variation, of, device, impedance, over, a, range, of, frequencies, may, be, of, interest, the, impedance, may, be, measured, or, displayed, directly, in, ohms, or, other, values, related, to, impedance, may, be, displayed, for, example, in, a, radio, antenna, the, standing, wave, ratio, or, reflection, coefficient, may, be, more, useful, than, the, impedance, alone, the, measurement, of, impedance, requires, the, measurement, of, the, magnitude, of, voltage, and, current, and, the, phase, difference, between, them, impedance, is, often, measured, by, bridge, methods, similar, to, the, direct, current, wheatstone, bridge, a, calibrated, reference, impedance, is, adjusted, to, balance, off, the, effect, of, the, impedance, of, the, device, under, test, impedance, measurement, in, power, electronic, devices, may, require, simultaneous, measurement, and, provision, of, power, to, the, operating, device, the, impedance, of, a, device, can, be, calculated, by, complex, division, of, the, voltage, and, current, the, impedance, of, the, device, can, be, calculated, by, applying, a, sinusoidal, voltage, to, the, device, in, series, with, a, resistor, and, measuring, the, voltage, across, the, resistor, and, across, the, device, performing, this, measurement, by, sweeping, the, frequencies, of, the, applied, signal, provides, the, impedance, phase, and, magnitude, the, use, of, an, impulse, response, may, be, used, in, combination, with, the, fast, fourier, transform, fft, to, rapidly, measure, the, electrical, impedance, of, various, electrical, devices, the, lcr, meter, inductance, l, capacitance, c, and, resistance, r, is, a, device, commonly, used, to, measure, the, inductance, resistance, and, capacitance, of, a, component, from, these, values, the, impedance, at, any, frequency, can, be, calculated, consider, an, lc, tank, circuit, the, complex, impedance, of, the, circuit, is, it, is, immediately, seen, that, the, value, of, 1, z, textstyle, 1, over, z, is, minimal, actually, equal, to, 0, in, this, case, whenever, therefore, the, fundamental, resonance, angular, frequency, is, in, general, neither, impedance, nor, admittance, can, vary, with, time, since, they, are, defined, for, complex, exponentials, in, which, t, if, the, complex, exponential, voltage, to, current, ratio, changes, over, time, or, amplitude, the, circuit, element, cannot, be, described, using, the, frequency, domain, however, many, components, and, systems, e, g, varicaps, that, are, used, in, radio, tuners, may, exhibit, non, linear, or, time, varying, voltage, to, current, ratios, that, seem, to, be, linear, time, invariant, lti, for, small, signals, and, over, small, observation, windows, so, they, can, be, roughly, described, as, if, they, had, a, time, varying, impedance, this, description, is, an, approximation, over, large, signal, swings, or, wide, observation, windows, the, voltage, to, current, relationship, will, not, be, lti, and, cannot, be, described, by, impedance
