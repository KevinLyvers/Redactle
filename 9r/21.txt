the, second, symbol, s, is, the, unit, of, time, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, historically, defined, as, 1, 86400, of, a, day, this, factor, derived, from, the, division, of, the, day, first, into, 24, hours, then, to, 60, minutes, and, finally, to, 60, seconds, each, 24, 60, 60, 86400, the, current, and, formal, definition, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, is, more, precise, the, second, is, defined, by, taking, the, fixed, numerical, value, of, the, caesium, frequency, cs, the, unperturbed, ground, state, hyperfine, transition, frequency, of, the, caesium, 133, atom, to, be, 9, 192, 631, 770, when, expressed, in, the, unit, hz, which, is, equal, to, s, 1, this, current, definition, was, adopted, in, 1967, when, it, became, feasible, to, define, the, second, based, on, fundamental, properties, of, nature, with, caesium, clocks, because, the, speed, of, earth, s, rotation, varies, and, is, slowing, ever, so, slightly, a, leap, second, is, added, at, irregular, intervals, to, civil, time, to, keep, clocks, in, sync, with, earth, s, rotation, minute, comes, from, the, latin, pars, minuta, prima, meaning, first, small, part, i, e, first, division, of, the, hour, dividing, into, sixty, and, second, comes, from, the, pars, minuta, secunda, second, small, part, dividing, again, into, sixty, analog, clocks, and, watches, often, have, sixty, tick, marks, on, their, faces, representing, seconds, and, minutes, and, a, second, hand, to, mark, the, passage, of, time, in, seconds, digital, clocks, and, watches, often, have, a, two, digit, seconds, counter, si, prefixes, are, frequently, combined, with, the, word, second, to, denote, subdivisions, of, the, second, milliseconds, thousandths, microseconds, millionths, nanoseconds, billionths, and, sometimes, smaller, units, of, a, second, multiples, of, seconds, are, usually, counted, in, hours, and, minutes, though, si, prefixes, may, also, be, used, to, form, multiples, of, the, second, such, as, kiloseconds, thousands, of, seconds, such, units, are, rarely, used, in, practice, an, everyday, experience, with, small, fractions, of, a, second, is, a, 1, gigahertz, microprocessor, that, has, a, cycle, time, of, 1, nanosecond, camera, shutter, speeds, are, often, expressed, in, fractions, of, a, second, such, as, 1, 30, second, or, 1, 1000, second, sexagesimal, divisions, of, the, day, from, a, calendar, based, on, astronomical, observation, have, existed, since, the, third, millennium, bc, though, they, were, not, seconds, as, we, know, them, today, small, divisions, of, time, could, not, be, measured, back, then, so, such, divisions, were, mathematically, derived, the, first, timekeepers, that, could, count, seconds, accurately, were, pendulum, clocks, invented, in, the, 17th, century, starting, in, the, 1950s, atomic, clocks, became, better, timekeepers, than, earth, s, rotation, and, they, continue, to, set, the, standard, today, a, mechanical, clock, which, does, not, depend, on, measuring, the, relative, rotational, position, of, the, earth, keeps, uniform, time, called, mean, time, within, whatever, accuracy, is, intrinsic, to, it, that, means, that, every, second, minute, and, every, other, division, of, time, counted, by, the, clock, has, the, same, duration, as, any, other, identical, division, of, time, but, a, sundial, which, measures, the, relative, position, of, the, sun, in, the, sky, called, apparent, time, does, not, keep, uniform, time, the, time, kept, by, a, sundial, varies, by, time, of, year, meaning, that, seconds, minutes, and, every, other, division, of, time, is, a, different, duration, at, different, times, of, the, year, the, time, of, day, measured, with, mean, time, versus, apparent, time, may, differ, by, as, much, as, 15, minutes, but, a, single, day, differs, from, the, next, by, only, a, small, amount, 15, minutes, is, a, cumulative, difference, over, a, part, of, the, year, the, effect, is, due, chiefly, to, the, obliqueness, of, earth, s, axis, with, respect, to, its, orbit, around, the, sun, the, difference, between, apparent, solar, time, and, mean, time, was, recognized, by, astronomers, since, antiquity, but, prior, to, the, invention, of, accurate, mechanical, clocks, in, the, mid, 17th, century, sundials, were, the, only, reliable, timepieces, and, apparent, solar, time, was, the, only, generally, accepted, standard, fractions, of, a, second, are, usually, denoted, in, decimal, notation, for, example, 2, 01, seconds, or, two, and, one, hundredth, seconds, multiples, of, seconds, are, usually, expressed, as, minutes, and, seconds, or, hours, minutes, and, seconds, of, clock, time, separated, by, colons, such, as, 11, 23, 24, or, 45, 23, the, latter, notation, can, give, rise, to, ambiguity, because, the, same, notation, is, used, to, denote, hours, and, minutes, it, rarely, makes, sense, to, express, longer, periods, of, time, like, hours, or, days, in, seconds, because, they, are, awkwardly, large, numbers, for, the, metric, unit, of, second, there, are, decimal, prefixes, representing, 10, 30, to, 10, 30, seconds, some, common, units, of, time, in, seconds, are, a, minute, is, 60, seconds, an, hour, is, 3, 600, seconds, a, day, is, 86, 400, seconds, a, week, is, 604, 800, seconds, a, year, other, than, leap, years, is, 31, 536, 000, seconds, and, a, gregorian, century, averages, 3, 155, 695, 200, seconds, with, all, of, the, above, excluding, any, possible, leap, seconds, in, astronomy, a, julian, year, is, precisely, 31, 557, 600, seconds, some, common, events, in, seconds, are, a, stone, falls, about, 4, 9, meters, from, rest, in, one, second, a, pendulum, of, length, about, one, meter, has, a, swing, of, one, second, so, pendulum, clocks, have, pendulums, about, a, meter, long, the, fastest, human, sprinters, run, 10, meters, in, a, second, an, ocean, wave, in, deep, water, travels, about, 23, meters, in, one, second, sound, travels, about, 343, meters, in, one, second, in, air, light, takes, 1, 3, seconds, to, reach, earth, from, the, surface, of, the, moon, a, distance, of, 384, 400, kilometers, a, second, is, directly, part, of, other, units, such, as, frequency, measured, in, hertz, inverse, seconds, or, s, 1, speed, in, meters, per, second, and, acceleration, in, meters, per, second, squared, the, metric, system, unit, becquerel, a, measure, of, radioactive, decay, is, measured, in, inverse, seconds, and, higher, powers, of, second, are, involved, in, derivatives, of, acceleration, such, as, jerk, though, many, derivative, units, for, everyday, things, are, reported, in, terms, of, larger, units, of, time, not, seconds, they, are, ultimately, defined, in, terms, of, the, si, second, this, includes, time, expressed, in, hours, and, minutes, velocity, of, a, car, in, kilometers, per, hour, or, miles, per, hour, kilowatt, hours, of, electricity, usage, and, speed, of, a, turntable, in, rotations, per, minute, moreover, most, other, si, base, units, are, defined, by, their, relationship, to, the, second, the, meter, is, defined, by, setting, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, to, be, 299, 792, 458, m, s, exactly, definitions, of, the, si, base, units, kilogram, ampere, kelvin, and, candela, also, depend, on, the, second, the, only, base, unit, whose, definition, does, not, depend, on, the, second, is, the, mole, and, only, two, of, the, 22, named, derived, units, radian, and, steradian, do, not, depend, on, the, second, either, a, set, of, atomic, clocks, throughout, the, world, keeps, time, by, consensus, the, clocks, vote, on, the, correct, time, and, all, voting, clocks, are, steered, to, agree, with, the, consensus, which, is, called, international, atomic, time, tai, tai, ticks, atomic, seconds, 207, 218, civil, time, is, defined, to, agree, with, the, rotation, of, the, earth, the, international, standard, for, timekeeping, is, coordinated, universal, time, utc, this, time, scale, ticks, the, same, atomic, seconds, as, tai, but, inserts, or, omits, leap, seconds, as, necessary, to, correct, for, variations, in, the, rate, of, rotation, of, the, earth, 16, 17, 207, a, time, scale, in, which, the, seconds, are, not, exactly, equal, to, atomic, seconds, is, ut1, a, form, of, universal, time, ut1, is, defined, by, the, rotation, of, the, earth, with, respect, to, the, sun, and, does, not, contain, any, leap, seconds, 68, 232, ut1, always, differs, from, utc, by, less, than, a, second, while, they, are, not, yet, part, of, any, timekeeping, standard, optical, lattice, clocks, with, frequencies, in, the, visible, light, spectrum, now, exist, and, are, the, most, accurate, timekeepers, of, all, a, strontium, clock, with, frequency, 430, thz, in, the, red, range, of, visible, light, during, the, 2010s, held, the, accuracy, record, it, gains, or, loses, less, than, a, second, in, 15, billion, years, which, is, longer, than, the, estimated, age, of, the, universe, such, a, clock, can, measure, a, change, in, its, elevation, of, as, little, as, 2, cm, by, the, change, in, its, rate, due, to, gravitational, time, dilation, there, have, only, ever, been, three, definitions, of, the, second, as, a, fraction, of, the, day, as, a, fraction, of, an, extrapolated, year, and, as, the, microwave, frequency, of, a, caesium, atomic, clock, which, have, each, realized, a, sexagesimal, division, of, the, day, from, ancient, astronomical, calendars, civilizations, in, the, classic, period, and, earlier, created, divisions, of, the, calendar, as, well, as, arcs, using, a, sexagesimal, system, of, counting, so, at, that, time, the, second, was, a, sexagesimal, subdivision, of, the, day, ancient, second, day, 60, 60, not, of, the, hour, like, the, modern, second, hour, 60, 60, sundials, and, water, clocks, were, among, the, earliest, timekeeping, devices, and, units, of, time, were, measured, in, degrees, of, arc, conceptual, units, of, time, smaller, than, realisable, on, sundials, were, also, used, there, are, references, to, second, as, part, of, a, lunar, month, in, the, writings, of, natural, philosophers, of, the, middle, ages, which, were, mathematical, subdivisions, that, could, not, be, measured, mechanically, the, earliest, mechanical, clocks, which, appeared, starting, in, the, 14th, century, had, displays, that, divided, the, hour, into, halves, thirds, quarters, and, sometimes, even, 12, parts, but, never, by, 60, in, fact, the, hour, was, not, commonly, divided, in, 60, minutes, as, it, was, not, uniform, in, duration, it, was, not, practical, for, timekeepers, to, consider, minutes, until, the, first, mechanical, clocks, that, displayed, minutes, appeared, near, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, mechanical, clocks, kept, the, mean, time, as, opposed, to, the, apparent, time, displayed, by, sundials, by, that, time, sexagesimal, divisions, of, time, were, well, established, in, europe, the, earliest, clocks, to, display, seconds, appeared, during, the, last, half, of, the, 16th, century, the, second, became, accurately, measurable, with, the, development, of, mechanical, clocks, the, earliest, spring, driven, timepiece, with, a, second, hand, that, marked, seconds, is, an, unsigned, clock, depicting, orpheus, in, the, fremersdorf, collection, dated, between, 1560, and, 1570, 417, 418, during, the, 3rd, quarter, of, the, 16th, century, taqi, al, din, built, a, clock, with, marks, every, 1, 5, minute, in, 1579, jost, b, rgi, built, a, clock, for, william, of, hesse, that, marked, seconds, 105, in, 1581, tycho, brahe, redesigned, clocks, that, had, displayed, only, minutes, at, his, observatory, so, they, also, displayed, seconds, even, though, those, seconds, were, not, accurate, in, 1587, tycho, complained, that, his, four, clocks, disagreed, by, plus, or, minus, four, seconds, 104, in, 1656, dutch, scientist, christiaan, huygens, invented, the, first, pendulum, clock, it, had, a, pendulum, length, of, just, under, a, meter, giving, it, a, swing, of, one, second, and, an, escapement, that, ticked, every, second, it, was, the, first, clock, that, could, accurately, keep, time, in, seconds, by, the, 1730s, 80, years, later, john, harrison, s, maritime, chronometers, could, keep, time, accurate, to, within, one, second, in, 100, days, in, 1832, gauss, proposed, using, the, second, as, the, base, unit, of, time, in, his, millimeter, milligram, second, system, of, units, the, british, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, baas, in, 1862, stated, that, all, men, of, science, are, agreed, to, use, the, second, of, mean, solar, time, as, the, unit, of, time, baas, formally, proposed, the, cgs, system, in, 1874, although, this, system, was, gradually, replaced, over, the, next, 70, years, by, mks, units, both, the, cgs, and, mks, systems, used, the, same, second, as, their, base, unit, of, time, mks, was, adopted, internationally, during, the, 1940s, defining, the, second, as, 1, 86, 400, of, a, mean, solar, day, sometime, in, the, late, 1940s, quartz, crystal, oscillator, clocks, with, an, operating, frequency, of, 100, khz, advanced, to, keep, time, with, accuracy, better, than, 1, part, in, 10, 8, over, an, operating, period, of, a, day, it, became, apparent, that, a, consensus, of, such, clocks, kept, better, time, than, the, rotation, of, the, earth, metrologists, also, knew, that, earth, s, orbit, around, the, sun, a, year, was, much, more, stable, than, earth, s, rotation, this, led, to, proposals, as, early, as, 1950, to, define, the, second, as, a, fraction, of, a, year, the, earth, s, motion, was, described, in, newcomb, s, tables, of, the, sun, 1895, which, provided, a, formula, for, estimating, the, motion, of, the, sun, relative, to, the, epoch, 1900, based, on, astronomical, observations, made, between, 1750, and, 1892, this, resulted, in, adoption, of, an, ephemeris, time, scale, expressed, in, units, of, the, sidereal, year, at, that, epoch, by, the, iau, in, 1952, this, extrapolated, timescale, brings, the, observed, positions, of, the, celestial, bodies, into, accord, with, newtonian, dynamical, theories, of, their, motion, in, 1955, the, tropical, year, considered, more, fundamental, than, the, sidereal, year, was, chosen, by, the, iau, as, the, unit, of, time, the, tropical, year, in, the, definition, was, not, measured, but, calculated, from, a, formula, describing, a, mean, tropical, year, that, decreased, linearly, over, time, in, 1956, the, second, was, redefined, in, terms, of, a, year, relative, to, that, epoch, the, second, was, thus, defined, as, the, fraction, 1, 31, 556, 925, 9747, of, the, tropical, year, for, 1900, january, 0, at, 12, hours, ephemeris, time, this, definition, was, adopted, as, part, of, the, international, system, of, units, in, 1960, even, the, best, mechanical, electric, motorized, and, quartz, crystal, based, clocks, develop, discrepancies, from, environmental, conditions, far, better, for, timekeeping, is, the, natural, and, exact, vibration, in, an, energized, atom, the, frequency, of, vibration, i, e, radiation, is, very, specific, depending, on, the, type, of, atom, and, how, it, is, excited, since, 1967, the, second, has, been, defined, as, exactly, the, duration, of, 9, 192, 631, 770, periods, of, the, radiation, corresponding, to, the, transition, between, the, two, hyperfine, levels, of, the, ground, state, of, the, caesium, 133, atom, this, length, of, a, second, was, selected, to, correspond, exactly, to, the, length, of, the, ephemeris, second, previously, defined, atomic, clocks, use, such, a, frequency, to, measure, seconds, by, counting, cycles, per, second, at, that, frequency, radiation, of, this, kind, is, one, of, the, most, stable, and, reproducible, phenomena, of, nature, the, current, generation, of, atomic, clocks, is, accurate, to, within, one, second, in, a, few, hundred, million, years, since, 1967, atomic, clocks, based, on, atoms, other, than, caesium, 133, have, been, developed, with, increased, precision, by, a, factor, of, 100, therefore, a, new, definition, of, the, second, is, planned, atomic, clocks, now, set, the, length, of, a, second, and, the, time, standard, for, the, world, 231, 232, 12960276813, 408986496,

at, the, 86th, 1997, meeting, of, the, cipm, gcpm, 1998, 7th, edition, si, brochure, a, future, re, definition, of, the, second, would, be, justified, if, these, idealized, conditions, can, be, achieved, much, easier, than, with, the, current, definition, the, definition, of, the, second, should, be, understood, as, the, definition, of, the, unit, of, proper, time, it, applies, in, a, small, spatial, domain, that, shares, the, motion, of, the, caesium, atom, used, to, realize, the, definition, in, a, laboratory, sufficiently, small, to, allow, the, effects, of, the, non, uniformity, of, the, gravitational, field, to, be, neglected, when, compared, to, the, uncertainties, of, the, realization, of, the, second, the, proper, second, is, obtained, after, application, of, the, special, relativistic, correction, for, the, velocity, of, the, atom, in, the, laboratory, it, is, wrong, to, correct, for, the, local, gravitational, field, the, reference, to, an, unperturbed, atom, is, intended, to, make, it, clear, that, the, definition, of, the, si, second, is, based, on, an, isolated, caesium, atom, that, is, unperturbed, by, any, external, field, such, as, ambient, black, body, radiation, the, second, so, defined, is, the, unit, of, proper, time, in, the, sense, of, the, general, theory, of, relativity, to, allow, the, provision, of, a, coordinated, time, scale, the, signals, of, different, primary, clocks, in, different, locations, are, combined, which, have, to, be, corrected, for, relativistic, caesium, frequency, shifts, see, section, 2, 3, 6, the, cipm, has, adopted, various, secondary, representations, of, the, second, based, on, a, selected, number, of, spectral, lines, of, atoms, ions, or, molecules, the, unperturbed, frequencies, of, these, lines, can, be, determined, with, a, relative, uncertainty, not, lower, than, that, of, the, realization, of, the, second, based, on, the, 133, cs, hyperfine, transition, frequency, but, some, can, be, reproduced, with, superior, stability, si, brochure, 9, in, 2022, the, best, realisation, of, the, second, is, done, with, caesium, primary, standard, clocks, such, as, it, csf2, nist, f2, npl, csf2, ptb, csf2, su, csfo2, or, syrte, fo2, these, clocks, work, by, laser, cooling, a, cloud, of, cs, atoms, to, a, microkelvin, in, a, magneto, optic, trap, these, cold, atoms, are, then, launched, vertically, by, laser, light, the, atoms, then, undergo, ramsey, excitation, in, a, microwave, cavity, the, fraction, of, excited, atoms, is, then, detected, by, laser, beams, these, clocks, have, 5, 10, 16, systematic, uncertainty, which, is, equivalent, to, 50, picoseconds, per, day, a, system, of, several, fountains, worldwide, contribute, to, international, atomic, time, these, caesium, clocks, also, underpin, optical, frequency, measurements, optical, clocks, are, based, on, forbidden, optical, transitions, in, ions, or, atoms, they, have, frequencies, around, 10, 15, hz, with, a, natural, linewidth, f, displaystyle, delta, f, of, typically, 1, hz, so, the, q, factor, is, about, 10, 15, or, even, higher, they, have, better, stabilities, than, microwave, clocks, which, means, that, they, can, facilitate, evaluation, of, lower, uncertainties, they, also, have, better, time, resolution, which, means, the, clock, ticks, faster, optical, clocks, use, either, a, single, ion, or, an, optical, lattice, with, 10, 4, 10, 6, atoms, a, definition, based, on, the, rydberg, constant, would, involve, fixing, the, value, to, a, certain, value, r, m, e, e, 4, 8, 0, 2, h, 3, c, m, e,

atom, with, the, nonrelativistic, approximation, e, n, r, c, h, n, 2, displaystyle, e, n, approx, frac, r, infty, ch, n, 2, the, only, viable, way, to, fix, the, rydberg, constant, involves, trapping, and, cooling, hydrogen, this, is, difficult, because, it, is, very, light, and, the, atoms, move, very, fast, causing, doppler, shifts, the, radiation, needed, to, cool, the, hydrogen, 121, 5, nm, is, also, difficult, another, hurdle, involves, improving, the, uncertainty, in, qed, calculations, specifically, the, lamb, shift, in, the, 1s, 2s, transition, of, the, hydrogen, atom, a, redefinition, must, include, improved, optical, clock, reliability, tai, must, be, contributed, to, by, optical, clocks, before, the, bipm, affirms, a, redefinition, a, consistent, method, of, sending, signals, must, be, developed, before, the, second, is, redefined, such, as, fiber, optics, si, prefixes, are, commonly, used, for, times, shorter, than, one, second, but, rarely, for, multiples, of, a, second, instead, certain, non, si, units, are, permitted, for, use, with, si, minutes, hours, days, and, in, astronomy, julian, years
