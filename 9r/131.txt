centaurus, a, also, known, as, ngc, 5128, or, caldwell, 77, is, a, galaxy, in, the, constellation, of, centaurus, it, was, discovered, in, 1826, by, scottish, astronomer, james, dunlop, from, his, home, in, parramatta, in, new, south, wales, australia, there, is, considerable, debate, in, the, literature, regarding, the, galaxy, s, fundamental, properties, such, as, its, hubble, type, lenticular, galaxy, or, a, giant, elliptical, galaxy, and, distance, 11, 13, million, light, years, it, is, the, closest, radio, galaxy, to, earth, as, well, as, the, closest, bl, lac, object, so, its, active, galactic, nucleus, has, been, extensively, studied, by, professional, astronomers, the, galaxy, is, also, the, fifth, brightest, in, the, sky, making, it, an, ideal, amateur, astronomy, target, it, is, only, visible, from, the, southern, hemisphere, and, low, northern, latitudes, the, center, of, the, galaxy, contains, a, supermassive, black, hole, with, a, mass, of, 55, million, solar, masses, which, ejects, a, relativistic, jet, that, is, responsible, for, emissions, in, the, x, ray, and, radio, wavelengths, by, taking, radio, observations, of, the, jet, separated, by, a, decade, astronomers, have, determined, that, the, inner, parts, of, the, jet, are, moving, at, about, half, of, the, speed, of, light, x, rays, are, produced, farther, out, as, the, jet, collides, with, surrounding, gases, resulting, in, the, creation, of, highly, energetic, particles, the, x, ray, jets, of, centaurus, a, are, thousands, of, light, years, long, while, the, radio, jets, are, over, a, million, light, years, long, it, is, also, one, of, the, nearest, large, starburst, galaxies, of, which, a, galactic, collision, is, suspected, to, be, responsible, for, an, intense, burst, of, star, formation, models, have, suggested, that, centaurus, a, was, a, large, elliptical, galaxy, that, collided, with, a, smaller, spiral, galaxy, with, which, it, will, eventually, merge, for, that, reason, the, galaxy, has, been, of, particular, interest, to, astronomers, for, years, while, collisions, of, spiral, galaxies, are, relatively, common, the, effects, of, a, collision, between, an, elliptical, and, a, spiral, galaxy, are, not, fully, understood, ngc, 5128, was, discovered, on, 29, april, 1826, by, james, dunlop, during, a, survey, at, the, parramatta, observatory, in, 1847, john, herschel, described, the, galaxy, as, two, semi, ovals, of, elliptically, formed, nebula, appearing, to, be, cut, asunder, and, separated, by, a, broad, obscure, band, parallel, to, the, larger, axis, of, the, nebula, in, the, midst, of, which, a, faint, streak, of, light, parallel, to, the, sides, of, the, cut, appears, in, 1949, john, gatenby, bolton, bruce, slee, and, gordon, stanley, localized, ngc, 5128, as, one, of, the, first, extragalactic, radio, sources, five, years, later, walter, baade, and, rudolph, minkowski, suggested, that, the, peculiar, structure, is, the, result, of, a, merge, event, of, a, giant, elliptical, galaxy, and, a, small, spiral, galaxy, the, first, detection, of, x, ray, emissions, using, a, sounding, rocket, was, performed, in, 1970, in, 1975, 76, gamma, ray, emissions, from, centaurus, a, were, observed, through, the, atmospheric, cherenkov, technique, the, einstein, observatory, detected, an, x, ray, jet, emanating, from, the, nucleus, in, 1979, ten, years, later, young, blue, stars, were, found, along, the, central, dust, band, with, the, hubble, space, telescope, the, chandra, x, ray, observatory, identified, in, 1999, more, than, 200, new, point, sources, another, space, telescope, the, spitzer, space, telescope, found, a, parallelogram, shaped, structure, of, dust, in, near, infrared, images, of, centaurus, a, in, 2006, evidence, of, gamma, emissions, with, very, high, energy, more, than, 100, gev, was, detected, by, the, h, e, s, s, observatorium, in, namibia, in, 2009, the, following, year, centaurus, a, was, identified, as, a, source, of, cosmic, rays, of, highest, energies, after, years, of, observations, by, pierre, auger, observatory, in, 2016, a, review, of, data, from, chandra, and, xmm, newton, unusual, high, flares, of, energy, were, found, in, ngc, 5128, and, the, galaxy, ngc, 4636, jimmy, irwin, of, university, of, alabama, hypothesized, the, discovery, as, potentially, a, black, hole, in, a, yet, unknown, process, or, an, intermediate, mass, black, hole, centaurus, a, may, be, described, as, having, a, peculiar, morphology, as, seen, from, earth, the, galaxy, looks, like, a, lenticular, or, elliptical, galaxy, with, a, superimposed, dust, lane, the, peculiarity, of, this, galaxy, was, first, identified, in, 1847, by, john, herschel, and, the, galaxy, was, included, in, halton, arp, s, atlas, of, peculiar, galaxies, published, in, 1966, as, one, of, the, best, examples, of, a, disturbed, galaxy, with, dust, absorption, the, galaxy, s, strange, morphology, is, generally, recognized, as, the, result, of, a, merger, between, two, smaller, galaxies, the, bulge, of, this, galaxy, is, composed, mainly, of, evolved, red, stars, the, dusty, disk, however, has, been, the, site, of, more, recent, star, formation, over, 100, star, formation, regions, have, been, identified, in, the, disk, two, supernovae, have, been, detected, in, centaurus, a, the, first, supernova, named, sn, 1986g, was, discovered, within, the, dark, dust, lane, of, the, galaxy, by, r, evans, in, 1986, it, was, later, identified, as, a, type, ia, supernova, which, forms, when, a, white, dwarf, s, mass, grows, large, enough, to, ignite, carbon, fusion, in, its, center, touching, off, a, runaway, thermonuclear, reaction, as, may, happen, when, a, white, dwarf, in, a, binary, star, system, strips, gas, away, from, the, other, star, sn, 1986g, was, used, to, demonstrate, that, the, spectra, of, type, ia, supernovae, are, not, all, identical, and, that, type, ia, supernovae, may, differ, in, the, way, that, they, change, in, brightness, over, time, the, second, supernova, designated, sn, 2016adj, was, discovered, by, backyard, observatory, supernova, search, in, february, 2016, and, was, initially, classified, as, a, type, ii, supernova, based, on, its, h, alpha, emission, line, a, subsequent, classification, found, the, spectrum, best, resembled, the, type, ib, core, collapse, supernova, 1999dn, see, type, ib, and, ic, supernovae, in, addition, to, these, supernovae, a, luminous, red, nova, designated, at, 2020nqq, type, ilrt, mag, 17, 8, was, discovered, on, 27, june, 2020, distance, estimates, to, centaurus, a, established, since, the, 1980s, typically, range, between, 3, 5, mpc, classical, cepheids, discovered, in, the, heavily, obscured, dust, lane, of, centaurus, a, yield, a, distance, between, 3, 3, 5, mpc, depending, on, the, nature, of, the, extinction, law, adopted, and, other, considerations, mira, variables, and, type, ii, cepheids, were, also, discovered, in, centaurus, a, the, latter, being, rarely, detected, beyond, the, local, group, the, distance, to, centaurus, a, established, from, several, indicators, such, as, mira, variables, and, planetary, nebulae, favour, a, more, distant, value, of, 3, 8, mpc, centaurus, a, is, at, the, center, of, one, of, two, subgroups, within, the, centaurus, a, m83, group, a, nearby, group, of, galaxies, messier, 83, the, southern, pinwheel, galaxy, is, at, the, center, of, the, other, subgroup, these, two, groups, are, sometimes, identified, as, one, group, and, sometimes, identified, as, two, groups, however, the, galaxies, around, centaurus, a, and, the, galaxies, around, m83, are, physically, close, to, each, other, and, both, subgroups, appear, not, to, be, moving, relative, to, each, other, the, centaurus, a, m83, group, is, located, in, the, virgo, supercluster, in, addition, to, dwarf, galaxies, centaurus, a, like, most, galaxies, has, a, population, of, globular, clusters, some, objects, that, appear, to, be, globular, clusters, are, hypothesized, to, be, the, tidally, stripped, cores, of, former, galaxies, the, most, extreme, example, is, the, object, vhh81, 01, whose, central, black, hole, is, estimated, to, be, around, 8, 10, 5, m, in, july, 2021, the, event, horizon, telescope, released, a, resolved, image, of, centaurus, a, showing, the, jet, coming, from, the, black, hole, at, its, center, centaurus, a, is, located, approximately, 4, north, of, omega, centauri, a, globular, cluster, visible, with, the, naked, eye, because, the, galaxy, has, a, high, surface, brightness, and, relatively, large, angular, size, it, is, an, ideal, target, for, amateur, astronomy, observations, the, bright, central, bulge, and, dark, dust, lane, are, visible, even, in, finderscopes, and, large, binoculars, and, additional, structure, may, be, seen, in, larger, telescopes, claims, have, been, made, that, centaurus, a, is, visible, to, the, naked, eye, under, exceptionally, good, conditions
