in, science, a, field, is, a, physical, quantity, represented, by, a, scalar, vector, or, tensor, that, has, a, value, for, each, point, in, space, and, time, a, weather, map, with, the, surface, temperature, described, by, assigning, a, number, to, each, point, on, the, map, is, an, example, of, a, scalar, field, a, surface, wind, map, assigning, an, arrow, to, each, point, on, a, map, that, describes, the, wind, speed, and, direction, at, that, point, is, an, example, of, a, vector, field, i, e, a, 1, dimensional, rank, 1, tensor, field, field, theories, mathematical, descriptions, of, how, field, values, change, in, space, and, time, are, ubiquitous, in, physics, for, instance, the, electric, field, is, another, rank, 1, tensor, field, while, electrodynamics, can, be, formulated, in, terms, of, two, interacting, vector, fields, at, each, point, in, spacetime, or, as, a, single, rank, 2, tensor, field, in, the, modern, framework, of, the, quantum, field, theory, even, without, referring, to, a, test, particle, a, field, occupies, space, contains, energy, and, its, presence, precludes, a, classical, true, vacuum, this, has, led, physicists, to, consider, electromagnetic, fields, to, be, a, physical, entity, making, the, field, concept, a, supporting, paradigm, of, the, edifice, of, modern, physics, richard, feynman, said, the, fact, that, the, electromagnetic, field, can, possess, momentum, and, energy, makes, it, very, real, and, a, particle, makes, a, field, and, a, field, acts, on, another, particle, and, the, field, has, such, familiar, properties, as, energy, content, and, momentum, just, as, particles, can, have, in, practice, the, strength, of, most, fields, diminishes, with, distance, eventually, becoming, undetectable, for, instance, the, strength, of, many, relevant, classical, fields, such, as, the, gravitational, field, in, newton, s, theory, of, gravity, or, the, electrostatic, field, in, classical, electromagnetism, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, distance, from, the, source, i, e, they, follow, gauss, s, law, a, field, can, be, classified, as, a, scalar, field, a, vector, field, a, spinor, field, or, a, tensor, field, according, to, whether, the, represented, physical, quantity, is, a, scalar, a, vector, a, spinor, or, a, tensor, respectively, a, field, has, a, consistent, tensorial, character, wherever, it, is, defined, i, e, a, field, cannot, be, a, scalar, field, somewhere, and, a, vector, field, somewhere, else, for, example, the, newtonian, gravitational, field, is, a, vector, field, specifying, its, value, at, a, point, in, spacetime, requires, three, numbers, the, components, of, the, gravitational, field, vector, at, that, point, moreover, within, each, category, scalar, vector, tensor, a, field, can, be, either, a, classical, field, or, a, quantum, field, depending, on, whether, it, is, characterized, by, numbers, or, quantum, operators, respectively, in, this, theory, an, equivalent, representation, of, field, is, a, field, particle, for, instance, a, boson, to, isaac, newton, his, law, of, universal, gravitation, simply, expressed, the, gravitational, force, that, acted, between, any, pair, of, massive, objects, when, looking, at, the, motion, of, many, bodies, all, interacting, with, each, other, such, as, the, planets, in, the, solar, system, dealing, with, the, force, between, each, pair, of, bodies, separately, rapidly, becomes, computationally, inconvenient, in, the, eighteenth, century, a, new, quantity, was, devised, to, simplify, the, bookkeeping, of, all, these, gravitational, forces, this, quantity, the, gravitational, field, gave, at, each, point, in, space, the, total, gravitational, acceleration, which, would, be, felt, by, a, small, object, at, that, point, this, did, not, change, the, physics, in, any, way, it, did, not, matter, if, all, the, gravitational, forces, on, an, object, were, calculated, individually, and, then, added, together, or, if, all, the, contributions, were, first, added, together, as, a, gravitational, field, and, then, applied, to, an, object, the, development, of, the, independent, concept, of, a, field, truly, began, in, the, nineteenth, century, with, the, development, of, the, theory, of, electromagnetism, in, the, early, stages, andr, marie, amp, re, and, charles, augustin, de, coulomb, could, manage, with, newton, style, laws, that, expressed, the, forces, between, pairs, of, electric, charges, or, electric, currents, however, it, became, much, more, natural, to, take, the, field, approach, and, express, these, laws, in, terms, of, electric, and, magnetic, fields, in, 1845, michael, faraday, became, the, first, to, coin, the, term, field, the, independent, nature, of, the, field, became, more, apparent, with, james, clerk, maxwell, s, discovery, that, waves, in, these, fields, called, electromagnetic, waves, propagated, at, a, finite, speed, consequently, the, forces, on, charges, and, currents, no, longer, just, depended, on, the, positions, and, velocities, of, other, charges, and, currents, at, the, same, time, but, also, on, their, positions, and, velocities, in, the, past, maxwell, at, first, did, not, adopt, the, modern, concept, of, a, field, as, a, fundamental, quantity, that, could, independently, exist, instead, he, supposed, that, the, electromagnetic, field, expressed, the, deformation, of, some, underlying, medium, the, luminiferous, aether, much, like, the, tension, in, a, rubber, membrane, if, that, were, the, case, the, observed, velocity, of, the, electromagnetic, waves, should, depend, upon, the, velocity, of, the, observer, with, respect, to, the, aether, despite, much, effort, no, experimental, evidence, of, such, an, effect, was, ever, found, the, situation, was, resolved, by, the, introduction, of, the, special, theory, of, relativity, by, albert, einstein, in, 1905, this, theory, changed, the, way, the, viewpoints, of, moving, observers, were, related, to, each, other, they, became, related, to, each, other, in, such, a, way, that, velocity, of, electromagnetic, waves, in, maxwell, s, theory, would, be, the, same, for, all, observers, by, doing, away, with, the, need, for, a, background, medium, this, development, opened, the, way, for, physicists, to, start, thinking, about, fields, as, truly, independent, entities, in, the, late, 1920s, the, new, rules, of, quantum, mechanics, were, first, applied, to, the, electromagnetic, field, in, 1927, paul, dirac, used, quantum, fields, to, successfully, explain, how, the, decay, of, an, atom, to, a, lower, quantum, state, led, to, the, spontaneous, emission, of, a, photon, the, quantum, of, the, electromagnetic, field, this, was, soon, followed, by, the, realization, following, the, work, of, pascual, jordan, eugene, wigner, werner, heisenberg, and, wolfgang, pauli, that, all, particles, including, electrons, and, protons, could, be, understood, as, the, quanta, of, some, quantum, field, elevating, fields, to, the, status, of, the, most, fundamental, objects, in, nature, that, said, john, wheeler, and, richard, feynman, seriously, considered, newton, s, pre, field, concept, of, action, at, a, distance, although, they, set, it, aside, because, of, the, ongoing, utility, of, the, field, concept, for, research, in, general, relativity, and, quantum, electrodynamics, there, are, several, examples, of, classical, fields, classical, field, theories, remain, useful, wherever, quantum, properties, do, not, arise, and, can, be, active, areas, of, research, elasticity, of, materials, fluid, dynamics, and, maxwell, s, equations, are, cases, in, point, some, of, the, simplest, physical, fields, are, vector, force, fields, historically, the, first, time, that, fields, were, taken, seriously, was, with, faraday, s, lines, of, force, when, describing, the, electric, field, the, gravitational, field, was, then, similarly, described, a, classical, field, theory, describing, gravity, is, newtonian, gravitation, which, describes, the, gravitational, force, as, a, mutual, interaction, between, two, masses, any, body, with, mass, m, is, associated, with, a, gravitational, field, g, which, describes, its, influence, on, other, bodies, with, mass, the, gravitational, field, of, m, at, a, point, r, in, space, corresponds, to, the, ratio, between, force, f, that, m, exerts, on, a, small, or, negligible, test, mass, m, located, at, r, and, the, test, mass, itself, stipulating, that, m, is, much, smaller, than, m, ensures, that, the, presence, of, m, has, a, negligible, influence, on, the, behavior, of, m, according, to, newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, f, r, is, given, by, where, r, displaystyle, hat, mathbf, r, is, a, unit, vector, lying, along, the, line, joining, m, and, m, and, pointing, from, m, to, m, therefore, the, gravitational, field, of, m, is, the, experimental, observation, that, inertial, mass, and, gravitational, mass, are, equal, to, an, unprecedented, level, of, accuracy, leads, to, the, identity, that, gravitational, field, strength, is, identical, to, the, acceleration, experienced, by, a, particle, this, is, the, starting, point, of, the, equivalence, principle, which, leads, to, general, relativity, because, the, gravitational, force, f, is, conservative, the, gravitational, field, g, can, be, rewritten, in, terms, of, the, gradient, of, a, scalar, function, the, gravitational, potential, r, michael, faraday, first, realized, the, importance, of, a, field, as, a, physical, quantity, during, his, investigations, into, magnetism, he, realized, that, electric, and, magnetic, fields, are, not, only, fields, of, force, which, dictate, the, motion, of, particles, but, also, have, an, independent, physical, reality, because, they, carry, energy, these, ideas, eventually, led, to, the, creation, by, james, clerk, maxwell, of, the, first, unified, field, theory, in, physics, with, the, introduction, of, equations, for, the, electromagnetic, field, the, modern, version, of, these, equations, is, called, maxwell, s, equations, a, charged, test, particle, with, charge, q, experiences, a, force, f, based, solely, on, its, charge, we, can, similarly, describe, the, electric, field, e, so, that, f, q, e, using, this, and, coulomb, s, law, tells, us, that, the, electric, field, due, to, a, single, charged, particle, is, the, electric, field, is, conservative, and, hence, can, be, described, by, a, scalar, potential, v, r, a, steady, current, i, flowing, along, a, path, will, create, a, field, b, that, exerts, a, force, on, nearby, moving, charged, particles, that, is, quantitatively, different, from, the, electric, field, force, described, above, the, force, exerted, by, i, on, a, nearby, charge, q, with, velocity, v, is, where, b, r, is, the, magnetic, field, which, is, determined, from, i, by, the, biot, savart, law, the, magnetic, field, is, not, conservative, in, general, and, hence, cannot, usually, be, written, in, terms, of, a, scalar, potential, however, it, can, be, written, in, terms, of, a, vector, potential, a, r, in, general, in, the, presence, of, both, a, charge, density, r, t, and, current, density, j, r, t, there, will, be, both, an, electric, and, a, magnetic, field, and, both, will, vary, in, time, they, are, determined, by, maxwell, s, equations, a, set, of, differential, equations, which, directly, relate, e, and, b, to, and, j, alternatively, one, can, describe, the, system, in, terms, of, its, scalar, and, vector, potentials, v, and, a, a, set, of, integral, equations, known, as, retarded, potentials, allow, one, to, calculate, v, and, a, from, and, j, and, from, there, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, are, determined, via, the, relations, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, electromagnetic, field, was, understood, as, a, collection, of, two, vector, fields, in, space, nowadays, one, recognizes, this, as, a, single, antisymmetric, 2nd, rank, tensor, field, in, spacetime, einstein, s, theory, of, gravity, called, general, relativity, is, another, example, of, a, field, theory, here, the, principal, field, is, the, metric, tensor, a, symmetric, 2nd, rank, tensor, field, in, spacetime, this, replaces, newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, waves, can, be, constructed, as, physical, fields, due, to, their, finite, propagation, speed, and, causal, nature, when, a, simplified, physical, model, of, an, isolated, closed, system, is, set, they, are, also, subject, to, the, inverse, square, law, for, electromagnetic, waves, there, are, optical, fields, and, terms, such, as, near, and, far, field, limits, for, diffraction, in, practice, though, the, field, theories, of, optics, are, superseded, by, the, electromagnetic, field, theory, of, maxwell, it, is, now, believed, that, quantum, mechanics, should, underlie, all, physical, phenomena, so, that, a, classical, field, theory, should, at, least, in, principle, permit, a, recasting, in, quantum, mechanical, terms, success, yields, the, corresponding, quantum, field, theory, for, example, quantizing, classical, electrodynamics, gives, quantum, electrodynamics, quantum, electrodynamics, is, arguably, the, most, successful, scientific, theory, experimental, data, confirm, its, predictions, to, a, higher, precision, to, more, significant, digits, than, any, other, theory, the, two, other, fundamental, quantum, field, theories, are, quantum, chromodynamics, and, the, electroweak, theory, in, quantum, chromodynamics, the, color, field, lines, are, coupled, at, short, distances, by, gluons, which, are, polarized, by, the, field, and, line, up, with, it, this, effect, increases, within, a, short, distance, around, 1, fm, from, the, vicinity, of, the, quarks, making, the, color, force, increase, within, a, short, distance, confining, the, quarks, within, hadrons, as, the, field, lines, are, pulled, together, tightly, by, gluons, they, do, not, bow, outwards, as, much, as, an, electric, field, between, electric, charges, these, three, quantum, field, theories, can, all, be, derived, as, special, cases, of, the, so, called, standard, model, of, particle, physics, general, relativity, the, einsteinian, field, theory, of, gravity, has, yet, to, be, successfully, quantized, however, an, extension, thermal, field, theory, deals, with, quantum, field, theory, at, finite, temperatures, something, seldom, considered, in, quantum, field, theory, in, brst, theory, one, deals, with, odd, fields, e, g, faddeev, popov, ghosts, there, are, different, descriptions, of, odd, classical, fields, both, on, graded, manifolds, and, supermanifolds, as, above, with, classical, fields, it, is, possible, to, approach, their, quantum, counterparts, from, a, purely, mathematical, view, using, similar, techniques, as, before, the, equations, governing, the, quantum, fields, are, in, fact, pdes, specifically, relativistic, wave, equations, rwes, thus, one, can, speak, of, yang, mills, dirac, klein, gordon, and, schr, dinger, fields, as, being, solutions, to, their, respective, equations, a, possible, problem, is, that, these, rwes, can, deal, with, complicated, mathematical, objects, with, exotic, algebraic, properties, e, g, spinors, are, not, tensors, so, may, need, calculus, for, spinor, fields, but, these, in, theory, can, still, be, subjected, to, analytical, methods, given, appropriate, mathematical, generalization, field, theory, usually, refers, to, a, construction, of, the, dynamics, of, a, field, i, e, a, specification, of, how, a, field, changes, with, time, or, with, respect, to, other, independent, physical, variables, on, which, the, field, depends, usually, this, is, done, by, writing, a, lagrangian, or, a, hamiltonian, of, the, field, and, treating, it, as, a, classical, or, quantum, mechanical, system, with, an, infinite, number, of, degrees, of, freedom, the, resulting, field, theories, are, referred, to, as, classical, or, quantum, field, theories, the, dynamics, of, a, classical, field, are, usually, specified, by, the, lagrangian, density, in, terms, of, the, field, components, the, dynamics, can, be, obtained, by, using, the, action, principle, it, is, possible, to, construct, simple, fields, without, any, prior, knowledge, of, physics, using, only, mathematics, from, multivariable, calculus, potential, theory, and, partial, differential, equations, pdes, for, example, scalar, pdes, might, consider, quantities, such, as, amplitude, density, and, pressure, fields, for, the, wave, equation, and, fluid, dynamics, temperature, concentration, fields, for, the, heat, diffusion, equations, outside, of, physics, proper, e, g, radiometry, and, computer, graphics, there, are, even, light, fields, all, these, previous, examples, are, scalar, fields, similarly, for, vectors, there, are, vector, pdes, for, displacement, velocity, and, vorticity, fields, in, applied, mathematical, fluid, dynamics, but, vector, calculus, may, now, be, needed, in, addition, being, calculus, for, vector, fields, as, are, these, three, quantities, and, those, for, vector, pdes, in, general, more, generally, problems, in, continuum, mechanics, may, involve, for, example, directional, elasticity, from, which, comes, the, term, tensor, derived, from, the, latin, word, for, stretch, complex, fluid, flows, or, anisotropic, diffusion, which, are, framed, as, matrix, tensor, pdes, and, then, require, matrices, or, tensor, fields, hence, matrix, or, tensor, calculus, the, scalars, and, hence, the, vectors, matrices, and, tensors, can, be, real, or, complex, as, both, are, fields, in, the, abstract, algebraic, ring, theoretic, sense, in, a, general, setting, classical, fields, are, described, by, sections, of, fiber, bundles, and, their, dynamics, is, formulated, in, the, terms, of, jet, manifolds, covariant, classical, field, theory, in, modern, physics, the, most, often, studied, fields, are, those, that, model, the, four, fundamental, forces, which, one, day, may, lead, to, the, unified, field, theory, a, convenient, way, of, classifying, a, field, classical, or, quantum, is, by, the, symmetries, it, possesses, physical, symmetries, are, usually, of, two, types, fields, are, often, classified, by, their, behaviour, under, transformations, of, spacetime, the, terms, used, in, this, classification, are, fields, may, have, internal, symmetries, in, addition, to, spacetime, symmetries, in, many, situations, one, needs, fields, which, are, a, list, of, spacetime, scalars, 1, 2, n, for, example, in, weather, prediction, these, may, be, temperature, pressure, humidity, etc, in, particle, physics, the, color, symmetry, of, the, interaction, of, quarks, is, an, example, of, an, internal, symmetry, that, of, the, strong, interaction, other, examples, are, isospin, weak, isospin, strangeness, and, any, other, flavour, symmetry, if, there, is, a, symmetry, of, the, problem, not, involving, spacetime, under, which, these, components, transform, into, each, other, then, this, set, of, symmetries, is, called, an, internal, symmetry, one, may, also, make, a, classification, of, the, charges, of, the, fields, under, internal, symmetries, statistical, field, theory, attempts, to, extend, the, field, theoretic, paradigm, toward, many, body, systems, and, statistical, mechanics, as, above, it, can, be, approached, by, the, usual, infinite, number, of, degrees, of, freedom, argument, much, like, statistical, mechanics, has, some, overlap, between, quantum, and, classical, mechanics, statistical, field, theory, has, links, to, both, quantum, and, classical, field, theories, especially, the, former, with, which, it, shares, many, methods, one, important, example, is, mean, field, theory, classical, fields, as, above, such, as, the, electromagnetic, field, are, usually, infinitely, differentiable, functions, but, they, are, in, any, case, almost, always, twice, differentiable, in, contrast, generalized, functions, are, not, continuous, when, dealing, carefully, with, classical, fields, at, finite, temperature, the, mathematical, methods, of, continuous, random, fields, are, used, because, thermally, fluctuating, classical, fields, are, nowhere, differentiable, random, fields, are, indexed, sets, of, random, variables, a, continuous, random, field, is, a, random, field, that, has, a, set, of, functions, as, its, index, set, in, particular, it, is, often, mathematically, convenient, to, take, a, continuous, random, field, to, have, a, schwartz, space, of, functions, as, its, index, set, in, which, case, the, continuous, random, field, is, a, tempered, distribution, we, can, think, about, a, continuous, random, field, in, a, very, rough, way, as, an, ordinary, function, that, is, displaystyle, pm, infty, almost, everywhere, but, such, that, when, we, take, a, weighted, average, of, all, the, infinities, over, any, finite, region, we, get, a, finite, result, the, infinities, are, not, well, defined, but, the, finite, values, can, be, associated, with, the, functions, used, as, the, weight, functions, to, get, the, finite, values, and, that, can, be, well, defined, we, can, define, a, continuous, random, field, well, enough, as, a, linear, map, from, a, space, of, functions, into, the, real, numbers
