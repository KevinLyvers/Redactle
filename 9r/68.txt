the, siemens, symbol, s, is, the, unit, of, electric, conductance, electric, susceptance, and, electric, admittance, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, conductance, susceptance, and, admittance, are, the, reciprocals, of, resistance, reactance, and, impedance, respectively, hence, one, siemens, is, equal, to, the, reciprocal, of, one, ohm, 1, and, is, also, referred, to, as, the, mho, the, siemens, was, adopted, by, the, iec, in, 1935, and, the, 14th, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, approved, the, addition, of, the, siemens, as, a, derived, unit, in, 1971, the, unit, is, named, after, ernst, werner, von, siemens, in, english, the, same, word, siemens, is, used, both, for, the, singular, and, plural, like, other, si, units, named, after, people, the, symbol, s, is, capitalized, but, the, name, of, the, unit, is, not, for, the, siemens, this, distinguishes, it, from, the, second, symbol, lower, case, s, the, related, property, electrical, conductivity, is, measured, in, units, of, siemens, per, metre, s, m, for, an, element, conducting, direct, current, electrical, resistance, r, and, electrical, conductance, g, are, defined, as, where, i, is, the, electric, current, through, the, object, and, v, is, the, voltage, electrical, potential, difference, across, the, object, the, unit, siemens, for, the, conductance, g, is, defined, by, where, is, the, ohm, a, is, the, ampere, and, v, is, the, volt, for, a, device, with, a, conductance, of, one, siemens, the, electric, current, through, the, device, will, increase, by, one, ampere, for, every, increase, of, one, volt, of, electric, potential, difference, across, the, device, the, conductance, of, a, resistor, with, a, resistance, of, five, ohms, for, example, is, 5, 1, which, is, equal, to, a, conductance, of, 200, ms, a, historical, equivalent, for, the, siemens, is, the, mho, m, o, the, name, is, derived, from, the, word, ohm, spelled, backwards, as, the, reciprocal, of, one, ohm, at, the, suggestion, of, sir, william, thomson, lord, kelvin, in, 1883, its, symbol, is, an, inverted, capital, greek, letter, omega, u, 2127, inverted, ohm, sign, nist, s, guide, for, the, use, of, the, international, system, of, units, si, refers, to, the, mho, as, an, unaccepted, special, name, for, an, si, unit, and, indicates, that, it, should, be, strictly, avoided, the, si, term, siemens, is, used, universally, in, science, and, often, in, electrical, applications, while, mho, is, still, used, in, some, electronic, contexts, the, inverted, capital, omega, symbol, while, not, an, official, si, abbreviation, is, less, likely, to, be, confused, with, a, variable, than, the, letter, s, when, writing, the, symbol, by, hand, the, usual, typographical, distinctions, such, as, italic, for, variables, and, roman, for, units, are, difficult, to, maintain, likewise, it, is, difficult, to, distinguish, the, symbol, s, siemens, from, the, lower, case, s, seconds, potentially, causing, confusion, so, for, example, a, pentode, s, transconductance, of, 2, 2, ms, might, alternatively, be, written, as, 2, 2, m, or, 2200, most, common, in, the, 1930s, or, 2, 2, ma, v, the, ohm, had, officially, replaced, the, old, siemens, unit, a, unit, of, resistance, at, an, international, conference, in, 1881
