an, ocean, current, is, a, continuous, directed, movement, of, seawater, generated, by, a, number, of, forces, acting, upon, the, water, including, wind, the, coriolis, effect, breaking, waves, cabbeling, and, temperature, and, salinity, differences, depth, contours, shoreline, configurations, and, interactions, with, other, currents, influence, a, current, s, direction, and, strength, ocean, currents, move, both, horizontally, on, scales, that, can, span, entire, oceans, as, well, as, vertically, with, vertical, currents, upwelling, and, downwelling, playing, an, important, role, in, the, movement, of, nutrients, and, gases, such, as, carbon, dioxide, between, the, surface, and, the, deep, ocean, ocean, currents, flow, for, great, distances, and, together, they, create, the, global, conveyor, belt, which, plays, a, dominant, role, in, determining, the, climate, of, many, of, earth, s, regions, more, specifically, ocean, currents, influence, the, temperature, of, the, regions, through, which, they, travel, for, example, warm, currents, traveling, along, more, temperate, coasts, increase, the, temperature, of, the, area, by, warming, the, sea, breezes, that, blow, over, them, perhaps, the, most, striking, example, is, the, gulf, stream, which, together, with, its, extension, the, north, atlantic, drift, makes, northwest, europe, much, more, temperate, for, its, high, latitude, than, other, areas, at, the, same, latitude, another, example, is, lima, peru, whose, cooler, subtropical, climate, contrasts, with, that, of, its, surrounding, tropical, latitudes, because, of, the, humboldt, current, the, largest, ocean, current, is, the, antarctic, circumpolar, current, acc, a, wind, driven, current, which, flows, clockwise, uninterrupted, around, antarctica, the, acc, connects, all, the, ocean, basins, together, and, also, provides, a, link, between, the, atmosphere, and, the, deep, ocean, due, to, the, way, water, upwells, and, downwells, on, either, side, of, it, ocean, currents, are, patterns, of, water, movement, that, influence, climate, zones, and, weather, patterns, around, the, world, they, are, primarily, driven, by, winds, and, by, seawater, density, although, many, other, factors, influence, them, including, the, shape, and, configuration, of, the, ocean, basin, they, flow, through, the, two, basic, types, of, currents, surface, and, deep, water, currents, help, define, the, character, and, flow, of, ocean, waters, across, the, planet, ocean, currents, are, driven, by, the, wind, by, the, gravitational, pull, of, the, moon, in, the, form, of, tides, and, by, the, effects, of, variations, in, water, density, ocean, dynamics, define, and, describe, the, motion, of, water, within, the, oceans, ocean, temperature, and, motion, fields, can, be, separated, into, three, distinct, layers, mixed, surface, layer, upper, ocean, above, the, thermocline, and, deep, ocean, ocean, currents, are, measured, in, units, of, sverdrup, sv, where, 1, sv, is, equivalent, to, a, volume, flow, rate, of, 1, 000, 000, m, 3, 35, 000, 000, cu, ft, per, second, surface, ocean, currents, in, contrast, to, subsurface, ocean, currents, make, up, only, 8, of, all, water, in, the, ocean, are, generally, restricted, to, the, upper, 400, m, 1, 300, ft, of, ocean, water, and, are, separated, from, lower, regions, by, varying, temperatures, and, salinity, which, affect, the, density, of, the, water, which, in, turn, defines, each, oceanic, region, because, the, movement, of, deep, water, in, ocean, basins, is, caused, by, density, driven, forces, and, gravity, deep, waters, sink, into, deep, ocean, basins, at, high, latitudes, where, the, temperatures, are, cold, enough, to, cause, the, density, to, increase, surface, currents, are, measured, in, units, of, meters, per, second, m, s, or, in, knots, surface, oceanic, currents, are, driven, by, wind, currents, the, large, scale, prevailing, winds, drive, major, persistent, ocean, currents, and, seasonal, or, occasional, winds, drive, currents, of, similar, persistence, to, the, winds, that, drive, them, and, the, coriolis, effect, plays, a, major, role, in, their, development, the, ekman, spiral, velocity, distribution, results, in, the, currents, flowing, at, an, angle, to, the, driving, winds, and, they, develop, typical, clockwise, spirals, in, the, northern, hemisphere, and, counter, clockwise, rotation, in, the, southern, hemisphere, in, addition, the, areas, of, surface, ocean, currents, move, somewhat, with, the, seasons, this, is, most, notable, in, equatorial, currents, deep, ocean, basins, generally, have, a, non, symmetric, surface, current, in, that, the, eastern, equator, ward, flowing, branch, is, broad, and, diffuse, whereas, the, pole, ward, flowing, western, boundary, current, is, relatively, narrow, large, scale, currents, are, driven, by, gradients, in, water, density, which, in, turn, depend, on, variations, in, temperature, and, salinity, this, thermohaline, circulation, is, also, known, as, the, ocean, s, conveyor, belt, where, significant, vertical, movement, of, ocean, currents, is, observed, this, is, known, as, upwelling, and, downwelling, the, adjective, thermohaline, derives, from, thermo, referring, to, temperature, and, haline, referring, to, salt, content, factors, which, together, determine, the, density, of, seawater, the, thermohaline, circulation, is, a, part, of, the, large, scale, ocean, circulation, that, is, driven, by, global, density, gradients, created, by, surface, heat, and, freshwater, fluxes, wind, driven, surface, currents, such, as, the, gulf, stream, travel, polewards, from, the, equatorial, atlantic, ocean, cooling, en, route, and, eventually, sinking, at, high, latitudes, forming, north, atlantic, deep, water, this, dense, water, then, flows, into, the, ocean, basins, while, the, bulk, of, it, upwells, in, the, southern, ocean, the, oldest, waters, with, a, transit, time, of, around, 1000, years, upwell, in, the, north, pacific, extensive, mixing, therefore, takes, place, between, the, ocean, basins, reducing, differences, between, them, and, making, the, earth, s, oceans, a, global, system, on, their, journey, the, water, masses, transport, both, energy, in, the, form, of, heat, and, matter, solids, dissolved, substances, and, gases, around, the, globe, as, such, the, state, of, the, circulation, has, a, large, impact, on, the, climate, of, the, earth, the, thermohaline, circulation, is, sometimes, called, the, ocean, conveyor, belt, the, great, ocean, conveyor, or, the, global, conveyor, belt, on, occasion, it, is, imprecisely, used, to, refer, to, the, meridional, overturning, circulation, moc, since, the, 2000s, an, international, program, called, argo, has, been, mapping, the, temperature, and, salinity, structure, of, the, ocean, with, a, fleet, of, automated, platforms, that, float, with, the, ocean, currents, the, information, gathered, will, help, explain, the, role, the, oceans, play, in, the, earth, s, climate, ocean, currents, affect, temperatures, throughout, the, world, for, example, the, ocean, current, that, brings, warm, water, up, the, north, atlantic, to, northwest, europe, also, cumulatively, and, slowly, blocks, ice, from, forming, along, the, seashores, which, would, also, block, ships, from, entering, and, exiting, inland, waterways, and, seaports, hence, ocean, currents, play, a, decisive, role, in, influencing, the, climates, of, regions, through, which, they, flow, ocean, currents, are, important, in, the, study, of, marine, debris, upwellings, and, cold, ocean, water, currents, flowing, from, polar, and, sub, polar, regions, bring, in, nutrients, that, support, plankton, growth, which, are, crucial, prey, items, for, several, key, species, in, marine, ecosystems, due, to, this, fish, populations, are, often, abundant, in, these, areas, ocean, currents, are, also, important, in, the, dispersal, and, distribution, of, many, organisms, inclusing, those, with, pelagic, egg, or, larval, stages, an, example, is, the, life, cycle, of, the, european, eel, terrestrial, species, for, example, tortoises, and, lizards, can, be, carried, on, floating, debris, by, currents, to, colonise, new, terrestrial, areas, and, islands, the, continued, rise, of, atmospheric, temperatures, is, anticipated, to, have, various, effects, on, the, strength, of, surface, ocean, currents, wind, driven, circulation, and, dispersal, patterns, ocean, currents, play, a, significant, role, in, influencing, climate, and, shifts, in, climate, in, turn, impact, ocean, currents, over, the, last, century, reconstructed, sea, surface, temperature, data, reveal, that, western, boundary, currents, are, heating, at, double, the, rate, of, the, global, average, these, observations, indicate, that, the, western, boundary, currents, are, likely, intensifying, due, to, this, change, in, temperature, and, may, continue, to, grow, stronger, in, the, near, future, there, is, evidence, that, surface, warming, due, to, anthropogenic, climate, change, has, accelerated, upper, ocean, currents, in, 77, of, the, global, ocean, specifically, increased, vertical, stratification, due, to, surface, warming, intensifies, upper, ocean, currents, while, changes, in, horizontal, density, gradients, caused, by, differential, warming, across, different, ocean, regions, results, in, the, acceleration, of, surface, zonal, currents, there, are, suggestions, that, the, atlantic, meridional, overturning, circulation, amoc, is, in, danger, of, collapsing, due, to, climate, change, which, would, have, extreme, impacts, on, the, climate, of, northern, europe, and, more, widely, although, this, topic, is, controversial, and, remains, an, active, area, of, research, in, addition, to, water, surface, temperatures, the, wind, systems, are, a, crucial, determinant, of, ocean, currents, wind, wave, systems, influence, oceanic, heat, exchange, the, condition, of, the, sea, surface, and, can, alter, ocean, currents, in, the, north, atlantic, equatorial, pacific, and, southern, ocean, increased, wind, speeds, as, well, as, significant, wave, heights, have, been, attributed, to, climate, change, and, natural, processes, combined, in, the, east, australian, current, global, warming, has, also, been, accredited, to, increased, wind, stress, curls, which, intensify, these, currents, and, may, even, indirectly, increase, sea, levels, due, to, the, additional, warming, created, by, stronger, currents, as, ocean, circulation, changes, due, to, climate, typical, distribution, patterns, are, also, changing, the, dispersal, patterns, of, marine, organisms, depend, on, oceanographic, conditions, which, as, a, result, influence, the, biological, composition, of, oceans, due, to, the, patchiness, of, the, natural, ecological, world, dispersal, is, a, species, survival, mechanism, for, various, organisms, with, strengthened, boundary, currents, moving, toward, the, poles, it, is, expected, that, some, marine, species, will, be, redirected, to, the, poles, and, greater, depths, the, strengthening, or, weakening, of, typical, dispersal, pathways, by, increased, temperatures, are, expected, to, not, only, impact, the, survival, of, native, marine, species, due, to, inability, to, replenish, their, meta, populations, but, also, may, increase, the, prevalence, of, invasive, species, in, japanese, corals, and, macroalgae, the, unusual, dispersal, pattern, of, organisms, toward, the, poles, may, destabilize, native, species, knowledge, of, surface, ocean, currents, is, essential, in, reducing, costs, of, shipping, since, traveling, with, them, reduces, fuel, costs, in, the, wind, powered, sailing, ship, era, knowledge, of, wind, patterns, and, ocean, currents, was, even, more, essential, using, ocean, currents, to, help, their, ships, into, harbor, and, using, currents, such, as, the, gulf, stream, to, get, back, home, the, lack, of, understanding, of, ocean, currents, during, that, time, period, is, hypothesized, to, be, one, of, the, contributing, factors, to, exploration, failure, the, gulf, stream, and, the, canary, current, keep, western, european, countries, warmer, and, less, variable, while, at, the, same, latitude, north, america, s, weather, was, colder, a, good, example, of, this, is, the, agulhas, current, down, along, eastern, africa, which, long, prevented, sailors, from, reaching, india, in, recent, times, around, the, world, sailing, competitors, make, good, use, of, surface, currents, to, build, and, maintain, speed, ocean, currents, can, also, be, used, for, marine, power, generation, with, areas, of, japan, florida, and, hawaii, being, considered, for, test, projects, the, utilization, of, currents, today, can, still, impact, global, trade, it, can, reduce, the, cost, and, emissions, of, shipping, vessels, ocean, currents, can, also, impact, the, fishing, industry, examples, of, this, include, the, tsugaru, oyashio, and, kuroshio, currents, all, of, which, influence, the, western, north, pacific, temperature, which, has, been, shown, to, be, a, habitat, predictor, for, the, skipjack, tuna, it, has, also, been, shown, that, it, is, not, just, local, currents, that, can, affect, a, country, s, economy, but, neighboring, currents, can, influence, the, viability, of, local, fishing, industries, currents, of, the, arctic, ocean, currents, of, the, atlantic, ocean, currents, of, the, indian, ocean, currents, of, the, pacific, ocean, currents, of, the, southern, ocean, oceanic, gyres
