the, hadley, cell, also, known, as, the, hadley, circulation, is, a, global, scale, tropical, atmospheric, circulation, that, features, air, rising, near, the, equator, flowing, poleward, near, the, tropopause, at, a, height, of, 12, 15, km, 7, 5, 9, 3, mi, above, the, earth, s, surface, cooling, and, descending, in, the, subtropics, at, around, 25, degrees, latitude, and, then, returning, equatorward, near, the, surface, it, is, a, thermally, direct, circulation, within, the, troposphere, that, emerges, due, to, differences, in, insolation, and, heating, between, the, tropics, and, the, subtropics, on, a, yearly, average, the, circulation, is, characterized, by, a, circulation, cell, on, each, side, of, the, equator, the, southern, hemisphere, hadley, cell, is, slightly, stronger, on, average, than, its, northern, counterpart, extending, slightly, beyond, the, equator, into, the, northern, hemisphere, during, the, summer, and, winter, months, the, hadley, circulation, is, dominated, by, a, single, cross, equatorial, cell, with, air, rising, in, the, summer, hemisphere, and, sinking, in, the, winter, hemisphere, analogous, circulations, may, occur, in, extraterrestrial, atmospheres, such, as, on, venus, and, mars, global, climate, is, greatly, influenced, by, the, structure, and, behavior, of, the, hadley, circulation, the, prevailing, trade, winds, are, a, manifestation, of, the, lower, branches, of, the, hadley, circulation, converging, air, and, moisture, in, the, tropics, to, form, the, intertropical, convergence, zone, itcz, where, the, earth, s, heaviest, rains, are, located, shifts, in, the, itcz, associated, with, the, seasonal, variability, of, the, hadley, circulation, cause, monsoons, the, sinking, branches, of, the, hadley, cells, give, rise, to, the, oceanic, subtropical, ridges, and, suppress, rainfall, many, of, the, earth, s, deserts, and, arid, regions, are, located, in, the, subtropics, coincident, with, the, position, of, the, sinking, branches, the, hadley, circulation, is, also, a, key, mechanism, for, the, meridional, transport, of, heat, angular, momentum, and, moisture, contributing, to, the, subtropical, jet, stream, the, moist, tropics, and, maintaining, a, global, thermal, equilibrium, the, hadley, circulation, is, named, after, george, hadley, who, in, 1735, postulated, the, existence, of, hemisphere, spanning, circulation, cells, driven, by, differences, in, heating, to, explain, the, trade, winds, other, scientists, later, developed, similar, arguments, or, critiqued, hadley, s, qualitative, theory, providing, more, rigorous, explanations, and, formalism, the, existence, of, a, broad, meridional, circulation, of, the, type, suggested, by, hadley, was, confirmed, in, the, mid, 20th, century, once, routine, observations, of, the, upper, troposphere, became, available, via, radiosondes, observations, and, climate, modelling, indicate, that, the, hadley, circulation, has, expanded, poleward, since, at, least, the, 1980s, as, a, result, of, climate, change, with, an, accompanying, but, less, certain, intensification, of, the, circulation, these, changes, have, been, associated, with, trends, in, regional, weather, patterns, model, projections, suggest, that, the, circulation, will, widen, and, weaken, throughout, the, 21st, century, due, to, climate, change, the, hadley, circulation, describes, the, broad, thermally, direct, and, meridional, overturning, of, air, within, the, troposphere, over, the, low, latitudes, within, the, global, atmospheric, circulation, the, meridional, flow, of, air, averaged, along, lines, of, latitude, are, organized, into, circulations, of, rising, and, sinking, motions, coupled, with, the, equatorward, or, poleward, movement, of, air, called, meridional, cells, these, include, the, prominent, hadley, cells, centered, over, the, tropics, and, the, weaker, ferrell, cells, centered, over, the, mid, latitudes, the, hadley, cells, result, from, the, contrast, of, insolation, between, the, warm, equatorial, regions, and, the, cooler, subtropical, regions, the, uneven, heating, of, earth, s, surface, results, in, regions, of, rising, and, descending, air, over, the, course, of, a, year, the, equatorial, regions, absorb, more, radiation, from, the, sun, than, they, radiate, away, at, higher, latitudes, the, earth, emits, more, radiation, than, it, receives, from, the, sun, without, a, mechanism, to, exchange, heat, meridionally, the, equatorial, regions, would, warm, and, the, higher, latitudes, would, cool, progressively, in, disequilibrium, the, broad, ascent, and, descent, of, air, results, in, a, pressure, gradient, force, that, drives, the, hadley, circulation, and, other, large, scale, flows, in, both, the, atmosphere, and, the, ocean, distributing, heat, and, maintaining, a, global, long, term, and, subseasonal, thermal, equilibrium, the, hadley, circulation, covers, almost, half, of, the, earth, s, surface, area, spanning, from, roughly, the, tropic, of, cancer, to, the, tropic, of, capricorn, vertically, the, circulation, occupies, the, entire, depth, of, the, troposphere, the, hadley, cells, comprising, the, circulation, consist, of, air, carried, equatorward, by, the, trade, winds, in, the, lower, troposphere, that, ascends, when, heated, near, the, equator, along, with, air, moving, poleward, in, the, upper, troposphere, air, that, is, moved, into, the, subtropics, cools, and, then, sinks, before, returning, equatorward, to, the, tropics, the, position, of, the, sinking, air, associated, with, the, hadley, cell, is, often, used, as, a, measure, of, the, meridional, width, of, the, global, tropics, the, equatorward, return, of, air, and, the, strong, influence, of, heating, make, the, hadley, cell, a, thermally, driven, and, enclosed, circulation, due, to, the, buoyant, rise, of, air, near, the, equator, and, the, sinking, of, air, at, higher, latitudes, a, pressure, gradient, develops, near, the, surface, with, lower, pressures, near, the, equator, and, higher, pressures, in, the, subtropics, this, provides, the, motive, force, for, the, equatorward, flow, in, the, lower, troposphere, however, the, release, of, latent, heat, associated, with, condensation, in, the, tropics, also, relaxes, the, decrease, in, pressure, with, height, resulting, in, higher, pressures, aloft, in, the, tropics, compared, to, the, subtropics, for, a, given, height, in, the, upper, troposphere, this, pressure, gradient, is, stronger, than, its, near, surface, counterpart, and, provides, the, motive, force, for, the, poleward, flow, in, the, upper, troposphere, hadley, cells, are, most, commonly, identified, using, the, mass, weighted, zonally, averaged, stream, function, of, meridional, winds, but, they, can, also, be, identified, by, other, measurable, or, derivable, physical, parameters, such, as, velocity, potential, or, the, vertical, component, of, wind, at, a, particular, pressure, level, given, the, latitude, displaystyle, phi, and, the, pressure, level, p, displaystyle, p, the, stokes, stream, function, characterizing, the, hadley, circulation, is, given, by, where, a, displaystyle, a, is, the, radius, of, earth, g, displaystyle, g, is, the, acceleration, due, to, the, gravity, of, earth, and, v, p, displaystyle, is, the, zonally, averaged, meridional, wind, at, the, prescribed, latitude, and, pressure, level, the, value, of, displaystyle, psi, gives, the, integrated, meridional, mass, flux, between, the, specified, pressure, level, and, the, top, of, the, earth, s, atmosphere, with, positive, values, indicating, northward, mass, transport, the, strength, of, the, hadley, cells, can, be, quantified, based, on, displaystyle, psi, including, the, maximum, and, minimum, values, or, averages, of, the, stream, function, both, overall, and, at, various, pressure, levels, hadley, cell, intensity, can, also, be, assessed, using, other, physical, quantities, such, as, the, velocity, potential, vertical, component, of, wind, transport, of, water, vapor, or, total, energy, of, the, circulation, the, structure, of, the, hadley, circulation, and, its, components, can, be, inferred, by, graphing, zonal, and, temporal, averages, of, global, winds, throughout, the, troposphere, at, shorter, timescales, individual, weather, systems, perturb, wind, flow, although, the, structure, of, the, hadley, circulation, varies, seasonally, when, winds, are, averaged, annually, from, an, eulerian, perspective, the, hadley, circulation, is, roughly, symmetric, and, composed, of, two, similar, hadley, cells, with, one, in, each, of, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, sharing, a, common, region, of, ascending, air, near, the, equator, however, the, southern, hemisphere, hadley, cell, is, stronger, the, winds, associated, with, the, annually, averaged, hadley, circulation, are, on, the, order, of, 5, m, s, 18, km, h, 11, mph, however, when, averaging, the, motions, of, air, parcels, as, opposed, to, the, winds, at, fixed, locations, a, lagrangian, perspective, the, hadley, circulation, manifests, as, a, broader, circulation, that, extends, farther, poleward, each, hadley, cell, can, be, described, by, four, primary, branches, of, airflow, within, the, tropics, the, trade, winds, in, the, low, latitudes, of, both, earth, s, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, converge, air, towards, the, equator, producing, a, belt, of, low, atmospheric, pressure, exhibiting, abundant, storms, and, heavy, rainfall, known, as, the, intertropical, convergence, zone, itcz, this, equatorward, movement, of, air, near, the, earth, s, surface, constitutes, the, lower, branch, of, the, hadley, cell, the, position, of, the, itcz, is, influenced, by, the, warmth, of, sea, surface, temperatures, sst, near, the, equator, and, the, strength, of, cross, equatorial, pressure, gradients, in, general, the, itcz, is, located, near, the, equator, or, is, offset, towards, the, summer, hemisphere, where, the, warmest, ssts, are, located, on, an, annual, average, the, rising, branch, of, the, hadley, circulation, is, slightly, offset, towards, the, northern, hemisphere, away, from, the, equator, due, to, the, coriolis, force, the, trade, winds, deflect, opposite, the, direction, of, earth, s, rotation, blowing, partially, westward, rather, than, directly, equatorward, in, both, hemispheres, the, lower, branch, accrues, moisture, resulting, from, evaporation, across, earth, s, tropical, oceans, a, warmer, environment, and, converging, winds, force, the, moistened, air, to, ascend, near, the, equator, resulting, in, the, rising, branch, of, the, hadley, cell, the, upward, motion, is, further, enhanced, by, the, release, of, latent, heat, as, the, uplift, of, moist, air, results, in, an, equatorial, band, of, condensation, and, precipitation, the, hadley, circulation, s, upward, branch, largely, occurs, in, thunderstorms, occupying, only, around, one, percent, of, the, surface, area, of, the, tropics, the, transport, of, heat, in, the, hadley, circulation, s, ascending, branch, is, accomplished, most, efficiently, by, hot, towers, cumulonimbus, clouds, bearing, strong, updrafts, that, do, not, mix, in, drier, air, commonly, found, in, the, middle, troposphere, and, thus, allow, the, movement, of, air, from, the, highly, moist, tropical, lower, troposphere, into, the, upper, troposphere, approximately, 1, 500, 5, 000, hot, towers, daily, near, the, itcz, region, are, required, to, sustain, the, vertical, heat, transport, exhibited, by, the, hadley, circulation, the, ascent, of, air, rises, into, the, upper, troposphere, to, a, height, of, 12, 15, km, 7, 5, 9, 3, mi, after, which, air, diverges, outward, from, the, itcz, and, towards, the, poles, the, top, of, the, hadley, cell, is, set, by, the, height, of, the, tropopause, as, the, stable, stratosphere, above, prevents, the, continued, ascent, of, air, air, arising, from, the, low, latitudes, has, higher, absolute, angular, momentum, about, earth, s, axis, of, rotation, the, distance, between, the, atmosphere, and, earth, s, axis, decreases, poleward, to, conserve, angular, momentum, poleward, moving, air, parcels, must, accelerate, eastward, the, coriolis, effect, limits, the, poleward, extent, of, the, hadley, circulation, accelerating, air, in, the, direction, of, the, earth, s, rotation, and, forming, a, jet, stream, directed, zonally, rather, than, continuing, the, poleward, flow, of, air, at, each, hadley, cell, s, poleward, boundary, considering, only, the, conservation, of, angular, momentum, a, parcel, of, air, at, rest, along, the, equator, would, accelerate, to, a, zonal, speed, of, 134, m, s, 480, km, h, 300, mph, by, the, time, it, reached, 30, latitude, however, small, scale, turbulence, along, the, parcel, s, poleward, trek, and, large, scale, eddies, in, the, mid, latitude, dissipate, angular, momentum, the, jet, associated, with, the, southern, hemisphere, hadley, cell, is, stronger, than, its, northern, counterpart, due, to, the, stronger, intensity, of, the, southern, hemisphere, cell, the, cooler, higher, latitudes, leads, to, cooling, of, air, parcels, which, causes, the, poleward, air, to, eventually, descend, when, the, movement, of, air, is, averaged, annually, the, descending, branch, of, the, hadley, cell, is, located, roughly, over, the, 25th, parallel, north, and, the, 25th, parallel, south, the, moisture, in, the, subtropics, is, then, partly, advected, poleward, by, eddies, and, partly, advected, equatorward, by, the, lower, branch, of, the, hadley, cell, where, it, is, later, brought, towards, the, itcz, although, the, zonally, averaged, hadley, cell, is, organized, into, four, main, branches, these, branches, are, aggregations, of, more, concentrated, air, flows, and, regions, of, mass, transport, several, theories, and, physical, models, have, attempted, to, explain, the, latitudinal, width, of, the, hadley, cell, the, held, hou, model, provides, one, theoretical, constraint, on, the, meridional, extent, of, the, hadley, cells, by, assuming, a, simplified, atmosphere, composed, of, a, lower, layer, subject, to, friction, from, the, earth, s, surface, and, an, upper, layer, free, from, friction, the, model, predicts, that, the, hadley, circulation, would, be, restricted, to, within, 2, 500, km, 1, 600, mi, of, the, equator, if, parcels, do, not, have, any, net, heating, within, the, circulation, according, to, the, held, hou, model, the, latitude, of, the, hadley, cell, s, poleward, edge, displaystyle, phi, scales, according, to, where, displaystyle, delta, theta, is, the, difference, in, potential, temperature, between, the, equator, and, the, pole, in, radiative, equilibrium, h, t, displaystyle, h, t, is, the, height, of, the, tropopause, displaystyle, omega, is, the, earth, s, rotation, rate, and, 0, displaystyle, theta, 0, is, a, reference, potential, temperature, other, compatible, models, posit, that, the, width, of, the, hadley, cell, may, scale, with, other, physical, parameters, such, as, the, vertically, averaged, brunt, v, is, l, frequency, in, the, tropopshere, or, the, growth, rate, of, baroclinic, waves, shed, by, the, cell, the, hadley, circulation, varies, considerably, with, seasonal, changes, around, the, equinox, during, the, spring, and, autumn, for, either, the, northern, or, southern, hemisphere, the, hadley, circulation, takes, the, form, of, two, relatively, weaker, hadley, cells, in, both, hemispheres, sharing, a, common, region, of, ascent, over, the, itcz, and, moving, air, aloft, towards, each, cell, s, respective, hemisphere, however, closer, to, the, solstices, the, hadley, circulation, transitions, into, a, more, singular, and, stronger, cross, equatorial, hadley, cell, with, air, rising, in, the, summer, hemisphere, and, broadly, descending, in, the, winter, hemisphere, the, transition, between, the, two, cell, and, single, cell, configuration, is, abrupt, and, during, most, of, the, year, the, hadley, circulation, is, characterized, by, a, single, dominant, hadley, cell, that, transports, air, across, the, equator, in, this, configuration, the, ascending, branch, is, located, in, the, tropical, latitudes, of, the, warmer, summer, hemisphere, and, the, descending, branch, is, positioned, in, the, subtropics, of, the, cooler, winter, hemisphere, two, cells, are, still, present, in, each, hemisphere, though, the, winter, hemisphere, s, cell, becomes, much, more, prominent, while, the, summer, hemisphere, s, cell, becomes, displaced, poleward, the, intensification, of, the, winter, hemisphere, s, cell, is, associated, with, a, steepening, of, gradients, in, geopotential, height, leading, to, an, acceleration, of, trade, winds, and, stronger, meridional, flows, the, presence, of, continents, relaxes, temperature, gradients, in, the, summer, hemisphere, accentuating, the, contrast, between, the, hemispheric, hadley, cells, reanalysis, data, from, 1979, 2001, indicated, that, the, dominant, hadley, cell, in, boreal, summer, extended, from, 13, s, to, 31, n, on, average, in, both, boreal, and, austral, winters, the, indian, ocean, and, the, western, pacific, ocean, contribute, most, to, the, rising, and, sinking, motions, in, the, zonally, averaged, hadley, circulation, however, vertical, flows, over, africa, and, the, americas, are, more, marked, in, boreal, winter, at, longer, interannual, timescales, variations, in, the, hadley, circulation, are, associated, with, variations, in, the, el, ni, o, southern, oscillation, enso, which, impacts, the, positioning, of, the, ascending, branch, the, response, of, the, circulation, to, enso, is, non, linear, with, a, more, marked, response, to, el, ni, o, events, than, la, ni, a, events, during, el, ni, o, the, hadley, circulation, strengthens, due, to, the, increased, warmth, of, the, upper, troposphere, over, the, tropical, pacific, and, the, resultant, intensification, of, poleward, flow, however, these, changes, are, not, asymmetric, during, the, same, events, the, hadley, cells, over, the, western, pacific, and, the, atlantic, are, weakened, during, the, atlantic, ni, o, the, circulation, over, the, atlantic, is, intensified, the, atlantic, circulation, is, also, enhanced, during, periods, when, the, north, atlantic, oscillation, is, strongly, positive, the, variation, in, the, seasonally, averaged, and, annually, averaged, hadley, circulation, from, year, to, year, is, largely, accounted, for, by, two, juxtaposed, modes, of, oscillation, an, equatorial, symmetric, mode, characterized, by, single, cell, straddling, the, equator, and, an, equatorial, symmetric, mode, characterized, by, two, cells, on, either, side, of, the, equator, the, hadley, cell, is, an, important, mechanism, by, which, moisture, and, energy, are, transported, both, between, the, tropics, and, subtropics, and, between, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, however, it, is, not, an, efficient, transporter, of, energy, due, to, the, opposing, flows, of, the, lower, and, upper, branch, with, the, lower, branch, transporting, sensible, and, latent, heat, equatorward, and, the, upper, branch, transporting, potential, energy, poleward, the, resulting, net, energy, transport, poleward, represents, around, 10, percent, of, the, overall, energy, transport, involved, in, the, hadley, cell, the, descending, branch, of, the, hadley, cell, generates, clear, skies, and, a, surplus, of, evaporation, relative, to, precipitation, in, the, subtropics, the, lower, branch, of, the, hadley, circulation, accomplishes, most, of, the, transport, of, the, excess, water, vapor, accumulated, in, the, subtropical, atmosphere, towards, the, equatorial, region, the, strong, southern, hemisphere, hadley, cell, relative, to, its, northern, counterpart, leads, to, a, small, net, energy, transport, from, the, northern, to, the, southern, hemisphere, as, a, result, the, transport, of, energy, at, the, equator, is, directed, southward, on, average, with, an, annual, net, transport, of, around, 0, 1, pw, in, contrast, to, the, higher, latitudes, where, eddies, are, the, dominant, mechanism, for, transporting, energy, poleward, the, meridional, flows, imposed, by, the, hadley, circulation, are, the, primary, mechanism, for, poleward, energy, transport, in, the, tropics, as, a, thermally, direct, circulation, the, hadley, circulation, converts, available, potential, energy, to, the, kinetic, energy, of, horizontal, winds, based, on, data, from, january, 1979, and, december, 2010, the, hadley, circulation, has, an, average, power, output, of, 198, tw, with, maxima, in, january, and, august, and, minima, in, may, and, october, although, the, stability, of, the, tropopause, largely, limits, the, movement, of, air, from, the, troposphere, to, the, stratosphere, some, tropospheric, air, penetrates, into, the, stratosphere, via, the, hadley, cells, the, hadley, circulation, may, be, idealized, as, a, heat, engine, converting, heat, energy, into, mechanical, energy, as, air, moves, towards, the, equator, near, the, earth, s, surface, it, accumulates, entropy, from, the, surface, either, by, direct, heating, or, the, flux, of, sensible, or, latent, heat, in, the, ascending, branch, of, a, hadley, cell, the, ascent, of, air, is, approximately, an, adiabatic, process, with, respect, to, the, surrounding, environment, however, as, parcels, of, air, move, equatorward, in, the, cell, s, upper, branch, they, lose, entropy, by, radiating, heat, to, space, at, infrared, wavelengths, and, descend, in, response, this, radiative, cooling, occurs, at, a, rate, of, at, least, 60, w, m, 2, and, may, exceed, 100, w, m, 2, in, winter, the, heat, accumulated, during, the, equatorward, branch, of, the, circulation, is, greater, than, the, heat, lost, in, the, upper, poleward, branch, the, excess, heat, is, converted, into, the, mechanical, energy, that, drives, the, movement, of, air, this, difference, in, heating, also, results, in, the, hadley, circulation, transporting, heat, poleward, as, the, air, supplying, the, hadley, cell, s, upper, branch, has, greater, moist, static, energy, than, the, air, supplying, the, cell, s, lower, branch, within, the, earth, s, atmosphere, the, timescale, at, which, air, parcels, lose, heat, due, to, radiative, cooling, and, the, timescale, at, which, air, moves, along, the, hadley, circulation, are, at, similar, orders, of, magnitude, allowing, the, hadley, circulation, to, transport, heat, despite, cooling, in, the, circulation, s, upper, branch, air, with, high, potential, temperature, is, ultimately, moved, poleward, in, the, upper, troposphere, while, air, with, lower, potential, temperature, is, brought, equatorward, near, the, surface, as, a, result, the, hadley, circulation, is, one, mechanism, by, which, the, disequilibrium, produced, by, uneven, heating, of, the, earth, is, brought, towards, equilibrium, when, considered, as, a, heat, engine, the, thermodynamic, efficiency, of, the, hadley, circulation, averaged, around, 2, 6, percent, between, 1979, 2010, with, small, seasonal, variability, the, hadley, circulation, also, transports, planetary, angular, momentum, poleward, due, to, earth, s, rotation, because, the, trade, winds, are, directed, opposite, the, earth, s, rotation, eastward, angular, momentum, is, transferred, to, the, atmosphere, via, frictional, interaction, between, the, winds, and, topography, the, hadley, cell, then, transfers, this, angular, momentum, through, its, upward, and, poleward, branches, the, poleward, branch, accelerates, and, is, deflected, east, in, both, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, due, to, the, coriolis, force, and, the, conservation, of, angular, momentum, resulting, in, a, zonal, jet, stream, above, the, descending, branch, of, the, hadley, cell, the, formation, of, such, a, jet, implies, the, existence, of, a, thermal, wind, balance, supported, by, the, amplification, of, temperature, gradients, in, the, jet, s, vicinity, resulting, from, the, hadley, circulation, s, poleward, heat, advection, the, subtropical, jet, in, the, upper, troposphere, coincides, with, where, the, hadley, cell, meets, the, ferrell, cell, the, strong, wind, shear, accompanying, the, jet, presents, a, significant, source, of, baroclinic, instability, from, which, waves, grow, the, growth, of, these, waves, transfers, heat, and, momentum, polewards, atmospheric, eddies, extract, westerly, angular, momentum, from, the, hadley, cell, and, transport, it, downward, resulting, in, the, mid, latitude, westerly, winds, the, broad, structure, and, mechanism, of, the, hadley, circulation, comprising, convective, cells, moving, air, due, to, temperature, differences, in, a, manner, influenced, by, the, earth, s, rotation, was, first, proposed, by, edmund, halley, in, 1685, and, george, hadley, in, 1735, hadley, had, sought, to, explain, the, physical, mechanism, for, the, trade, winds, and, the, westerlies, the, hadley, circulation, and, the, hadley, cells, are, named, in, honor, of, his, pioneering, work, although, hadley, s, ideas, invoked, physical, concepts, that, would, not, be, formalized, until, well, after, his, death, his, model, was, largely, qualitative, and, without, mathematical, rigor, hadley, s, formulation, was, later, recognized, by, most, meteorologists, by, the, 1920s, to, be, a, simplification, of, more, complicated, atmospheric, processes, the, hadley, circulation, may, have, been, the, first, attempt, to, explain, the, global, distribution, of, winds, in, earth, s, atmosphere, using, physical, processes, however, hadley, s, hypothesis, could, not, be, verified, without, observations, of, winds, in, the, upper, atmosphere, data, collected, by, routine, radiosondes, beginning, in, the, mid, 20th, century, confirmed, the, existence, of, the, hadley, circulation, in, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, observations, of, maritime, weather, conditions, were, of, considerable, importance, to, maritime, transport, compilations, of, these, observations, showed, consistent, weather, conditions, from, year, to, year, and, significant, seasonal, variability, the, prevalence, of, dry, conditions, and, weak, winds, at, around, 30, latitude, and, the, equatorward, trade, winds, closer, to, the, equator, mirrored, in, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, was, apparent, by, 1600, early, efforts, by, scientists, to, explain, aspects, of, global, wind, patterns, often, focused, on, the, trade, winds, as, the, steadiness, of, the, winds, was, assumed, to, portend, a, simple, physical, mechanism, galileo, galilei, proposed, that, the, trade, winds, resulted, from, the, atmosphere, lagging, behind, the, earth, s, faster, tangential, rotation, speed, in, the, low, latitudes, resulting, in, the, westward, trades, directed, opposite, of, earth, s, rotation, in, 1685, english, polymath, edmund, halley, proposed, at, a, debate, organized, by, the, royal, society, that, the, trade, winds, resulted, from, east, to, west, temperature, differences, produced, over, the, course, of, a, day, within, the, tropics, in, halley, s, model, as, the, earth, rotated, the, location, of, maximum, heating, from, the, sun, moved, west, across, the, earth, s, surface, this, would, cause, air, to, rise, and, by, conservation, of, mass, halley, argued, that, air, would, be, moved, to, the, region, of, evacuated, air, generating, the, trade, winds, halley, s, hypothesis, was, criticized, by, his, friends, who, noted, that, his, model, would, lead, to, changing, wind, directions, throughout, the, course, of, a, day, rather, than, the, steady, trade, winds, halley, conceded, in, personal, correspondence, with, john, wallis, that, your, questioning, my, hypothesis, for, solving, the, trade, winds, makes, me, less, confident, of, the, truth, thereof, nonetheless, halley, s, formulation, was, incorporated, into, chambers, s, encyclopaedia, and, la, grande, encyclop, die, becoming, the, most, widely, known, explanation, for, the, trade, winds, until, the, early, 19th, century, though, his, explanation, of, the, trade, winds, was, incorrect, halley, correctly, predicted, that, the, surface, trade, winds, should, be, accompanied, by, an, opposing, flow, aloft, following, mass, conservation, unsatisfied, with, preceding, explanations, for, the, trade, winds, george, hadley, proposed, an, alternate, mechanism, in, 1735, hadley, s, hypothesis, was, published, in, the, paper, on, the, cause, of, the, general, trade, winds, in, philosophical, transactions, of, the, royal, society, like, halley, hadley, s, explanation, viewed, the, trade, winds, as, a, manifestation, of, air, moving, to, take, the, place, of, rising, warm, air, however, the, region, of, rising, air, prompting, this, flow, lay, along, the, lower, latitudes, understanding, that, the, tangential, rotation, speed, of, the, earth, was, fastest, at, the, equator, and, slowed, farther, poleward, hadley, conjectured, that, as, air, with, lower, momentum, from, higher, latitudes, moved, equatorward, to, replace, the, rising, air, it, would, conserve, its, momentum, and, thus, curve, west, by, the, same, token, the, rising, air, with, higher, momentum, would, spread, poleward, curving, east, and, then, sinking, as, it, cooled, to, produce, westerlies, in, the, mid, latitudes, hadley, s, explanation, implied, the, existence, of, hemisphere, spanning, circulation, cells, in, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, extending, from, the, equator, to, the, poles, though, he, relied, on, an, idealization, of, earth, s, atmosphere, that, lacked, seasonality, or, the, asymmetries, of, the, oceans, and, continents, his, model, also, predicted, rapid, easterly, trade, winds, of, around, 37, m, s, 130, km, h, 83, mph, though, he, argued, that, the, action, of, surface, friction, over, the, course, of, a, few, days, slowed, the, air, to, the, observed, wind, speeds, colin, maclaurin, extended, hadley, s, model, to, the, ocean, in, 1740, asserting, that, meridional, ocean, currents, were, subject, to, similar, westward, or, eastward, deflections, hadley, was, not, widely, associated, with, his, theory, due, to, conflation, with, his, older, brother, john, hadley, and, halley, his, theory, failed, to, gain, much, traction, in, the, scientific, community, for, over, a, century, due, to, its, unintuitive, explanation, and, the, lack, of, validating, observations, several, other, natural, philosophers, independently, forwarded, explanations, for, the, global, distribution, of, winds, soon, after, hadley, s, 1735, proposal, in, 1746, jean, le, rond, d, alembert, provided, a, mathematical, formulation, for, global, winds, but, disregarded, solar, heating, and, attributed, the, winds, to, the, gravitational, effects, of, the, sun, and, moon, immanuel, kant, also, unsatisfied, with, halley, s, explanation, for, the, trade, winds, published, an, explanation, for, the, trade, winds, and, westerlies, in, 1756, with, similar, reasoning, as, hadley, in, the, latter, part, of, the, 18th, century, pierre, simon, laplace, developed, a, set, of, equations, establishing, a, direct, influence, of, earth, s, rotation, on, wind, direction, swiss, scientist, jean, andr, deluc, published, an, explanation, of, the, trade, winds, in, 1787, similar, to, hadley, s, hypothesis, connecting, differential, heating, and, the, earth, s, rotation, with, the, direction, of, the, winds, english, chemist, john, dalton, was, the, first, to, clearly, credit, hadley, s, explanation, of, the, trade, winds, to, george, hadley, mentioning, hadley, s, work, in, his, 1793, book, meteorological, observations, and, essays, in, 1837, philosophical, magazine, published, a, new, theory, of, wind, currents, developed, by, heinrich, wilhelm, dove, without, reference, to, hadley, but, similarly, explaining, the, direction, of, the, trade, winds, as, being, influenced, by, the, earth, s, rotation, in, response, dalton, later, wrote, a, letter, to, the, editor, to, the, journal, promoting, hadley, s, work, dove, subsequently, credited, hadley, so, frequently, that, the, overarching, theory, became, known, as, the, hadley, dove, principle, popularizing, hadley, s, explanation, for, the, trade, winds, in, germany, and, great, britain, the, work, of, gustave, coriolis, william, ferrel, jean, bernard, foucault, and, henrik, mohn, in, the, 19th, century, helped, establish, the, coriolis, force, as, the, mechanism, for, the, deflection, of, winds, due, to, earth, s, rotation, emphasizing, the, conservation, of, angular, momentum, in, directing, flows, rather, than, the, conservation, of, linear, momentum, as, hadley, suggested, hadley, s, assumption, led, to, an, underestimation, of, the, deflection, by, a, factor, of, two, the, acceptance, of, the, coriolis, force, in, shaping, global, winds, led, to, debate, among, german, atmospheric, scientists, beginning, in, the, 1870s, over, the, completeness, and, validity, of, hadley, s, explanation, which, narrowly, explained, the, behavior, of, initially, meridional, motions, hadley, s, use, of, surface, friction, to, explain, why, the, trade, winds, were, much, slower, than, his, theory, would, predict, was, seen, as, a, key, weakness, in, his, ideas, the, southwesterly, motions, observed, in, cirrus, clouds, at, around, 30, n, further, discounted, hadley, s, theory, as, their, movement, was, far, slower, than, the, theory, would, predict, when, accounting, for, the, conservation, of, angular, momentum, in, 1899, william, morris, davis, a, professor, of, physical, geography, at, harvard, university, gave, a, speech, at, the, royal, meteorological, society, criticizing, hadley, s, theory, for, its, failure, to, account, for, the, transition, of, an, initially, unbalanced, flow, to, geostrophic, balance, davis, and, other, meteorologists, in, the, 20th, century, recognized, that, the, movement, of, air, parcels, along, hadley, s, envisaged, circulation, was, sustained, by, a, constant, interplay, between, the, pressure, gradient, and, coriolis, forces, rather, than, the, conservation, of, angular, momentum, alone, ultimately, while, the, atmospheric, science, community, considered, the, general, ideas, of, hadley, s, principle, valid, his, explanation, was, viewed, as, a, simplification, of, more, complex, physical, processes, hadley, s, model, of, the, global, atmospheric, circulation, being, characterized, by, hemisphere, wide, circulation, cells, was, also, challenged, by, weather, observations, showing, a, zone, of, high, pressure, in, the, subtropics, and, a, belt, of, low, pressure, at, around, 60, latitude, this, pressure, distribution, would, imply, a, poleward, flow, near, the, surface, in, the, mid, latitudes, rather, than, an, equatorward, flow, implied, by, hadley, s, envisioned, cells, ferrel, and, james, thomson, later, reconciled, the, pressure, pattern, with, hadley, s, model, by, proposing, a, circulation, cell, limited, to, lower, altitudes, in, the, mid, latitudes, and, nestled, within, the, broader, hemisphere, wide, hadley, cells, carl, gustaf, rossby, proposed, in, 1947, that, the, hadley, circulation, was, limited, to, the, tropics, forming, one, part, of, a, dynamically, driven, and, multi, celled, meridional, flow, rossby, s, model, resembled, that, of, a, similar, three, celled, model, developed, by, ferrel, in, 1860, the, three, celled, model, of, the, global, atmospheric, circulation, with, hadley, s, conceived, circulation, forming, its, tropical, component, had, been, widely, accepted, by, the, meteorological, community, by, the, early, 20th, century, however, the, hadley, cell, s, existence, was, only, validated, by, weather, observations, near, the, surface, and, its, predictions, of, winds, in, the, upper, troposphere, remained, untested, the, routine, sampling, of, the, upper, troposphere, by, radiosondes, that, emerged, in, the, mid, 20th, century, confirmed, the, existence, of, meridional, overturning, cells, in, the, atmosphere, the, hadley, circulation, is, one, of, the, most, important, influences, on, global, climate, and, planetary, habitability, as, well, as, an, important, transporter, of, angular, momentum, heat, and, water, vapor, hadley, cells, flatten, the, temperature, gradient, between, the, equator, and, the, poles, making, the, extratropics, milder, the, global, precipitation, pattern, of, high, precipitation, in, the, tropics, and, a, lack, of, precipitation, at, higher, latitudes, is, a, consequence, of, the, positioning, of, the, rising, and, sinking, branches, of, hadley, cells, respectively, near, the, equator, the, ascent, of, humid, air, results, in, the, heaviest, precipitation, on, earth, the, periodic, movement, of, the, itcz, and, thus, the, seasonal, variation, of, the, hadley, circulation, s, rising, branches, produces, the, world, s, monsoons, the, descending, motion, of, air, associating, with, the, sinking, branch, produces, surface, divergence, consistent, with, the, prominence, of, subtropical, high, pressure, areas, these, semipermanent, regions, of, high, pressure, lie, primarily, over, the, ocean, between, 20, and, 40, latitude, arid, conditions, are, associated, with, the, descending, branches, of, the, hadley, circulation, with, many, of, the, earth, s, deserts, and, semiarid, or, arid, regions, underlying, the, sinking, branches, of, the, hadley, circulation, the, cloudy, marine, boundary, layer, common, in, the, subtropics, may, be, seeded, by, cloud, condensation, nuclei, exported, out, of, the, tropics, by, the, hadley, circulation, paleoclimate, reconstructions, of, trade, winds, and, rainfall, patterns, suggest, that, the, hadley, circulation, changed, in, response, to, natural, climate, variability, during, heinrich, events, within, the, last, 100, 000, years, the, northern, hemisphere, hadley, cell, strengthened, while, the, southern, hemisphere, hadley, cell, weakened, variation, in, insolation, during, the, mid, to, late, holocene, resulted, in, a, southward, migration, of, the, northern, hemisphere, hadley, cell, s, ascending, and, descending, branches, closer, to, their, present, day, positions, tree, rings, from, the, mid, latitudes, of, the, northern, hemisphere, suggest, that, the, historical, position, of, the, hadley, cell, branches, have, also, shifted, in, response, to, shorter, oscillations, with, the, northern, hemisphere, descending, branch, moving, southward, during, positive, phases, of, the, el, ni, o, southern, oscillation, and, pacific, decadal, oscillation, and, northward, during, the, corresponding, negative, phases, the, hadley, cells, were, displaced, southward, between, 1400, 1850, concurrent, with, drought, in, parts, of, the, northern, hemisphere, according, to, the, ipcc, sixth, assessment, report, ar6, the, hadley, circulation, has, likely, expanded, since, at, least, the, 1980s, in, response, to, climate, change, with, medium, confidence, in, an, accompanying, intensification, of, the, circulation, an, expansion, of, the, overall, circulation, poleward, by, about, 0, 1, 0, 5, latitude, per, decade, since, the, 1980s, is, largely, accounted, for, by, the, poleward, shift, of, the, northern, hemisphere, hadley, cell, which, in, atmospheric, reanalysis, has, shown, a, more, marked, expansion, since, 1992, however, the, ar6, also, reported, medium, confidence, in, the, expansion, of, the, northern, hemisphere, hadley, cell, being, within, the, range, of, internal, variability, in, contrast, the, ar6, assessed, that, it, was, likely, that, the, southern, hemisphere, hadley, cell, s, poleward, expansion, was, due, to, anthropogenic, influence, this, finding, was, based, on, cmip5, and, cmip6, climate, models, studies, have, produced, a, large, range, of, estimates, for, the, rate, of, widening, of, the, tropics, due, to, the, use, of, different, metrics, estimates, based, on, upper, tropospheric, properties, tend, to, yield, a, wider, range, of, values, the, degree, to, which, the, circulation, has, expanded, varies, by, season, with, trends, in, summer, and, autumn, being, larger, and, statistically, significant, in, both, hemispheres, the, widening, of, the, hadley, circulation, has, also, resulted, in, a, likely, widening, of, the, itcz, since, the, 1970s, reanalyses, also, suggest, that, the, summer, and, autumn, hadley, cells, in, both, hemispheres, have, widened, and, that, the, global, hadley, circulation, has, intensified, since, 1979, with, a, more, pronounced, intensification, in, the, northern, hemisphere, between, 1979, 2010, the, power, generated, by, the, global, hadley, circulation, increased, by, an, average, of, 0, 54, tw, per, year, consistent, with, an, increased, input, of, energy, into, the, circulation, by, warming, ssts, over, the, tropical, oceans, for, comparison, the, hadley, circulation, s, overall, power, ranges, from, 0, 5, tw, to, 218, tw, throughout, the, year, in, the, northern, hemisphere, and, from, 32, to, 204, tw, in, the, southern, in, contrast, to, reanalyses, cmip5, climate, models, depict, a, weakening, of, the, hadley, circulation, since, 1979, the, magnitude, of, long, term, changes, in, the, circulation, strength, are, thus, uncertain, due, to, the, influence, of, large, interannual, variability, and, the, poor, representation, of, the, distribution, of, latent, heat, release, in, reanalyses, the, expansion, of, the, hadley, circulation, due, to, climate, change, is, consistent, with, the, held, hou, model, which, predicts, that, the, latitudinal, extent, of, the, circulation, is, proportional, to, the, square, root, of, the, height, of, the, tropopause, warming, of, the, troposphere, raises, the, tropopause, height, enabling, the, upper, poleward, branch, of, the, hadley, cells, to, extend, farther, and, leading, to, an, expansion, of, the, cells, results, from, climate, models, suggest, that, the, impact, of, internal, variability, such, as, from, the, pacific, decadal, oscillation, and, the, anthropogenic, influence, on, the, expansion, of, the, hadley, circulation, since, the, 1980s, have, been, comparable, human, influence, is, most, evident, in, the, expansion, of, the, southern, hemisphere, hadley, cell, the, ar6, assessed, medium, confidence, in, associating, the, expansion, of, the, hadley, circulation, in, both, hemispheres, with, the, added, radiative, forcing, of, greenhouse, gasses, the, physical, processes, by, which, the, hadley, circulation, expands, by, human, influence, are, unclear, but, may, be, linked, to, the, increased, warming, of, the, subtropics, relative, to, other, latitudes, in, both, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, the, enhanced, subtropical, warmth, could, enable, expansion, of, the, circulation, poleward, by, displacing, the, subtropical, jet, and, baroclinic, eddies, poleward, poleward, expansion, of, the, southern, hemisphere, hadley, cell, in, the, austral, summer, was, attributed, by, the, ipcc, fifth, assessment, report, ar5, to, stratospheric, ozone, depletion, based, on, cmip5, model, simulations, while, cmip6, simulations, have, not, shown, as, clear, of, a, signal, ozone, depletion, could, plausibly, affect, the, hadley, circulation, through, the, increase, of, radiative, cooling, in, the, lower, stratosphere, this, would, increase, the, phase, speed, of, baroclinic, eddies, and, displace, them, poleward, leading, to, expansion, of, hadley, cells, other, eddy, driven, mechanisms, for, expanding, hadley, cells, have, been, proposed, involving, changes, in, baroclinicity, wave, breaking, and, other, releases, of, instability, in, the, extratropics, of, the, northern, hemisphere, increasing, concentrations, of, black, carbon, and, tropospheric, ozone, may, be, a, major, forcing, on, that, hemisphere, s, hadley, cell, expansion, in, boreal, summer, projections, from, climate, models, indicate, that, a, continued, increase, in, the, concentration, of, greenhouse, gas, would, result, in, continued, widening, of, the, hadley, circulation, however, simulations, using, historical, data, suggest, that, forcing, from, greenhouse, gasses, may, account, for, about, 0, 1, per, decade, of, expansion, of, the, tropics, although, the, widening, of, the, hadley, cells, due, to, climate, change, has, occurred, concurrent, with, an, increase, in, their, intensity, based, on, atmospheric, reanalyses, climate, model, projections, generally, depict, a, weakening, circulation, in, tandem, with, a, widening, circulation, by, the, end, of, the, 21st, century, a, longer, term, increase, in, the, concentration, of, carbon, dioxide, may, lead, to, a, weakening, of, the, hadley, circulation, as, a, result, of, the, reduction, of, radiative, cooling, in, the, troposphere, near, the, circulation, s, sinking, branches, however, changes, in, the, oceanic, circulation, within, the, tropics, may, attenuate, changes, in, the, intensity, and, width, of, the, hadley, cells, by, reducing, thermal, contrasts, the, expansion, of, the, hadley, circulation, due, to, climate, change, is, connected, to, changes, in, regional, and, global, weather, patterns, a, widening, of, the, tropics, could, displace, the, tropical, rain, belt, expand, subtropical, deserts, and, exacerbate, wildfires, and, drought, the, documented, shift, and, expansion, of, subtropical, ridges, are, associated, with, changes, in, the, hadley, circulation, including, a, westward, extension, of, the, subtropical, high, over, the, northwestern, pacific, changes, in, the, intensity, and, position, of, the, azores, high, and, the, poleward, displacement, and, intensification, of, the, subtropical, high, pressure, belt, in, the, southern, hemisphere, these, changes, have, influenced, regional, precipitation, amounts, and, variability, including, drying, trends, over, southern, australia, northeastern, china, and, northern, south, asia, the, ar6, assessed, limited, evidence, that, the, expansion, of, the, northern, hemisphere, hadley, cell, may, have, led, in, part, to, drier, conditions, in, the, subtropics, and, a, poleward, expansion, of, aridity, during, boreal, summer, precipitation, changes, induced, by, hadley, circulation, changes, may, lead, to, changes, in, regional, soil, moisture, with, modelling, showing, the, most, significant, declines, in, the, mediterranean, sea, south, africa, and, the, southwestern, united, states, however, the, concurrent, effects, of, changing, surface, temperature, patterns, over, land, lead, to, uncertainties, over, the, influence, of, hadley, cell, broadening, on, drying, over, subtropical, land, areas, climate, modelling, suggests, that, the, shift, in, the, position, of, the, subtropical, highs, induced, by, hadley, cell, broadening, may, reduce, oceanic, upwelling, at, low, latitudes, and, enhance, oceanic, upwelling, at, high, latitudes, the, expansion, of, subtropical, highs, in, tandem, with, the, circulation, s, expansion, may, also, entail, a, widening, of, oceanic, regions, of, high, salinity, and, low, marine, primary, production, a, decline, in, extratropical, cyclones, in, the, storm, track, regions, in, model, projections, is, partly, influenced, by, hadley, cell, expansion, poleward, shifts, in, the, hadley, circulation, are, associated, with, shifts, in, the, paths, of, tropical, cyclones, in, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, including, a, poleward, trend, in, the, locations, where, storms, attained, their, peak, intensity, outside, of, earth, any, thermally, direct, circulation, that, circulates, air, meridionally, across, planetary, scale, gradients, of, insolation, may, be, described, as, a, hadley, circulation, a, terrestrial, atmosphere, subject, to, excess, equatorial, heating, tends, to, maintain, an, axisymmetric, hadley, circulation, with, rising, motions, near, the, equator, and, sinking, at, higher, latitudes, differential, heating, is, hypothesized, to, result, in, hadley, circulations, analogous, to, earth, s, on, other, atmospheres, in, the, solar, system, such, as, on, venus, mars, and, titan, as, with, earth, s, atmosphere, the, hadley, circulation, would, be, the, dominant, meridional, circulation, for, these, extraterrestrial, atmospheres, though, less, understood, hadley, circulations, may, also, be, present, on, the, gas, giants, of, the, solar, system, and, should, in, principle, materialize, on, exoplanetary, atmospheres, the, spatial, extent, of, a, hadley, cell, on, any, atmosphere, may, be, dependent, on, the, rotation, rate, of, the, planet, or, moon, with, a, faster, rotation, rate, leading, to, more, contracted, hadley, cells, with, a, more, restrictive, poleward, extent, and, a, more, cellular, global, meridional, circulation, the, slower, rotation, rate, reduces, the, coriolis, effect, thus, reducing, the, meridional, temperature, gradient, needed, to, sustain, a, jet, at, the, hadley, cell, s, poleward, boundary, and, thus, allowing, the, hadley, cell, to, extend, farther, poleward, venus, which, rotates, slowly, may, have, hadley, cells, that, extend, farther, poleward, than, earth, s, spanning, from, the, equator, to, high, latitudes, in, each, of, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, its, broad, hadley, circulation, would, efficiently, maintain, the, nearly, isothermal, temperature, distribution, between, the, planet, s, pole, and, equator, and, vertical, velocities, of, around, 0, 5, cm, s, 0, 018, km, h, 0, 011, mph, observations, of, chemical, tracers, such, as, carbon, monoxide, provide, indirect, evidence, for, the, existence, of, the, venusian, hadley, circulation, the, presence, of, poleward, winds, with, speeds, up, to, around, 15, m, s, 54, km, h, 34, mph, at, an, altitude, of, 65, km, 40, mi, are, typically, understood, to, be, associated, with, the, upper, branch, of, a, hadley, cell, which, may, be, located, 50, 65, km, 31, 40, mi, above, the, venusian, surface, the, slow, vertical, velocities, associated, with, the, hadley, circulation, have, not, been, measured, though, they, may, have, contributed, to, the, vertical, velocities, measured, by, vega, and, venera, missions, the, hadley, cells, may, extend, to, around, 60, latitude, equatorward, of, a, mid, latitude, jet, stream, demarcating, the, boundary, between, the, hypothesized, hadley, cell, and, the, polar, vortex, the, planet, s, atmosphere, may, exhibit, two, hadley, circulations, with, one, near, the, surface, and, the, other, at, the, level, of, the, upper, cloud, deck, the, venusian, hadley, circulation, may, contribute, to, the, superrotation, of, the, planet, s, atmosphere, simulations, of, the, martian, atmosphere, suggest, that, a, hadley, circulation, is, also, present, in, mars, atmosphere, exhibiting, a, stronger, seasonality, compared, to, earth, s, hadley, circulation, this, greater, seasonality, results, from, diminished, thermal, inertia, resulting, from, the, lack, of, an, ocean, and, the, planet, s, thinner, atmosphere, additionally, mars, orbital, eccentricity, leads, to, a, stronger, and, wider, hadley, cell, during, its, northern, winter, compared, to, its, southern, winter, during, most, of, the, martian, year, when, a, single, hadley, cell, prevails, its, rising, and, sinking, branches, are, located, at, 30, and, 60, latitude, respectively, in, global, climate, modelling, the, tops, of, the, hadley, cells, on, mars, may, reach, higher, to, around, 60, km, 37, mi, altitude, and, be, less, defined, compared, to, on, earth, due, to, the, lack, of, a, strong, tropopause, on, mars, while, latent, heating, from, phase, changes, associated, with, water, drive, much, of, the, ascending, motion, in, earth, s, hadley, circulation, ascent, in, mars, hadley, circulation, may, be, driven, by, radiative, heating, of, lofted, dust, and, intensified, by, the, condensation, of, carbon, dioxide, near, the, polar, ice, cap, of, mars, wintertime, hemisphere, steepening, pressure, gradients, over, the, course, of, the, martian, year, the, mass, flux, of, the, hadley, circulation, ranges, between, 10, 9, kg, s, 1, during, the, equinoxes, and, 10, 10, at, the, solstices, a, hadley, circulation, may, also, be, present, in, the, atmosphere, of, saturn, s, moon, titan, like, venus, the, slow, rotation, rate, of, titan, may, support, a, spatially, broad, hadley, circulation, general, circulation, modeling, of, titan, s, atmosphere, suggests, the, presence, of, a, cross, equatorial, hadley, cell, this, configuration, is, consistent, with, the, meridional, winds, observed, by, the, huygens, spacecraft, when, it, landed, near, titan, s, equator, during, titan, s, solstices, its, hadley, circulation, may, take, the, form, of, a, single, hadley, cell, that, extends, from, pole, to, pole, with, warm, gas, rising, in, the, summer, hemisphere, and, sinking, in, the, winter, hemisphere, a, two, celled, configuration, with, ascent, near, the, equator, is, present, in, modelling, during, a, limited, transitional, period, near, the, equinoxes, the, distribution, of, convective, methane, clouds, on, titan, and, observations, from, huygens, spacecraft, suggest, that, the, rising, branch, of, its, hadley, circulation, occurs, in, the, mid, latitudes, of, its, summer, hemisphere, frequent, cloud, formation, occurs, at, 40, latitude, in, titan, s, summer, hemisphere, from, ascent, analogous, to, earth, s, itcz
