ammonium, sulfate, american, english, and, international, scientific, usage, ammonium, sulphate, in, british, english, nh, 4, 2, so, 4, is, an, inorganic, salt, with, a, number, of, commercial, uses, the, most, common, use, is, as, a, soil, fertilizer, it, contains, 21, nitrogen, and, 24, sulfur, the, primary, use, of, ammonium, sulfate, is, as, a, fertilizer, for, alkaline, soils, in, the, soil, the, ammonium, ion, is, released, and, forms, a, small, amount, of, acid, lowering, the, ph, balance, of, the, soil, while, contributing, essential, nitrogen, for, plant, growth, the, main, disadvantage, to, the, use, of, ammonium, sulfate, is, its, low, nitrogen, content, relative, to, ammonium, nitrate, which, elevates, transportation, costs, it, is, also, used, as, an, agricultural, spray, adjuvant, for, water, soluble, insecticides, herbicides, and, fungicides, there, it, functions, to, bind, iron, and, calcium, cations, that, are, present, in, both, well, water, and, plant, cells, it, is, particularly, effective, as, an, adjuvant, for, 2, 4, d, amine, glyphosate, and, glufosinate, herbicides, ammonium, sulfate, precipitation, is, a, common, method, for, protein, purification, by, precipitation, as, the, ionic, strength, of, a, solution, increases, the, solubility, of, proteins, in, that, solution, decreases, ammonium, sulfate, is, extremely, soluble, in, water, due, to, its, ionic, nature, therefore, it, can, salt, out, proteins, by, precipitation, due, to, the, high, dielectric, constant, of, water, the, dissociated, salt, ions, being, cationic, ammonium, and, anionic, sulfate, are, readily, solvated, within, hydration, shells, of, water, molecules, the, significance, of, this, substance, in, the, purification, of, compounds, stems, from, its, ability, to, become, more, so, hydrated, compared, to, relatively, more, nonpolar, molecules, and, so, the, desirable, nonpolar, molecules, coalesce, and, precipitate, out, of, the, solution, in, a, concentrated, form, this, method, is, called, salting, out, and, necessitates, the, use, of, high, salt, concentrations, that, can, reliably, dissolve, in, the, aqueous, mixture, the, percentage, of, the, salt, used, is, in, comparison, to, the, maximal, concentration, of, the, salt, in, the, mixture, can, dissolve, as, such, although, high, concentrations, are, needed, for, the, method, to, work, adding, an, abundance, of, the, salt, over, 100, can, also, oversaturate, the, solution, therefore, contaminating, the, nonpolar, precipitate, with, salt, precipitate, a, high, salt, concentration, which, can, be, achieved, by, adding, or, increasing, the, concentration, of, ammonium, sulfate, in, a, solution, enables, protein, separation, based, on, a, decrease, in, protein, solubility, this, separation, may, be, achieved, by, centrifugation, precipitation, by, ammonium, sulfate, is, a, result, of, a, reduction, in, solubility, rather, than, protein, denaturation, thus, the, precipitated, protein, can, be, solubilized, through, the, use, of, standard, buffers, ammonium, sulfate, precipitation, provides, a, convenient, and, simple, means, to, fractionate, complex, protein, mixtures, in, the, analysis, of, rubber, lattices, volatile, fatty, acids, are, analyzed, by, precipitating, rubber, with, a, 35, ammonium, sulfate, solution, which, leaves, a, clear, liquid, from, which, volatile, fatty, acids, are, regenerated, with, sulfuric, acid, and, then, distilled, with, steam, selective, precipitation, with, ammonium, sulfate, opposite, to, the, usual, precipitation, technique, which, uses, acetic, acid, does, not, interfere, with, the, determination, of, volatile, fatty, acids, as, a, food, additive, ammonium, sulfate, is, considered, generally, recognized, as, safe, gras, by, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, and, in, the, european, union, it, is, designated, by, the, e, number, e517, it, is, used, as, an, acidity, regulator, in, flours, and, breads, in, the, treatment, of, drinking, water, ammonium, sulfate, is, used, in, combination, with, chlorine, to, generate, monochloramine, for, disinfection, ammonium, sulfate, is, used, on, a, small, scale, in, the, preparation, of, other, ammonium, salts, especially, ammonium, persulfate, ammonium, sulfate, is, listed, as, an, ingredient, for, many, united, states, vaccines, per, the, centers, for, disease, control, a, saturated, solution, of, ammonium, sulfate, in, heavy, water, d, 2, o, is, used, as, an, external, standard, in, sulfur, 33, s, nmr, spectroscopy, with, shift, value, of, 0, ppm, ammonium, sulfate, has, also, been, used, in, flame, retardant, compositions, acting, much, like, diammonium, phosphate, as, a, flame, retardant, it, increases, the, combustion, temperature, of, the, material, decreases, maximum, weight, loss, rates, and, causes, an, increase, in, the, production, of, residue, or, char, its, flame, retardant, efficacy, can, be, enhanced, by, blending, it, with, ammonium, sulfamate, it, has, been, used, in, aerial, firefighting, ammonium, sulfate, has, been, used, as, a, wood, preservative, but, due, to, its, hygroscopic, nature, this, use, has, been, largely, discontinued, because, of, associated, problems, with, metal, fastener, corrosion, dimensional, instability, and, finish, failures, ammonium, sulfate, is, made, by, treating, ammonia, with, sulfuric, acid, a, mixture, of, ammonia, gas, and, water, vapor, is, introduced, into, a, reactor, that, contains, a, saturated, solution, of, ammonium, sulfate, and, about, 2, to, 4, of, free, sulfuric, acid, at, 60, c, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, is, added, to, keep, the, solution, acidic, and, to, retain, its, level, of, free, acid, the, heat, of, reaction, keeps, reactor, temperature, at, 60, c, dry, powdered, ammonium, sulfate, may, be, formed, by, spraying, sulfuric, acid, into, a, reaction, chamber, filled, with, ammonia, gas, the, heat, of, reaction, evaporates, all, water, present, in, the, system, forming, a, powdery, salt, approximately, 6, 000, million, tons, were, produced, in, 1981, ammonium, sulfate, also, is, manufactured, from, gypsum, caso, 4, 2h, 2, o, finely, divided, gypsum, is, added, to, an, ammonium, carbonate, solution, calcium, carbonate, precipitates, as, a, solid, leaving, ammonium, sulfate, in, the, solution, ammonium, sulfate, occurs, naturally, as, the, rare, mineral, mascagnite, in, volcanic, fumaroles, and, due, to, coal, fires, on, some, dumps, ammonium, sulfate, becomes, ferroelectric, at, temperatures, below, 49, 5, c, at, room, temperature, it, crystallises, in, the, orthorhombic, system, with, cell, sizes, of, a, 7, 729, b, 10, 560, c, 5, 951, when, chilled, into, the, ferrorelectric, state, the, symmetry, of, the, crystal, changes, to, space, group, pna2, 1, ammonium, sulfate, decomposes, upon, heating, above, 250, c, 482, f, first, forming, ammonium, bisulfate, heating, at, higher, temperatures, results, in, decomposition, into, ammonia, nitrogen, sulfur, dioxide, and, water, as, a, salt, of, a, strong, acid, h, 2, so, 4, and, weak, base, nh, 3, its, solution, is, acidic, the, ph, of, 0, 1, m, solution, is, 5, 5, in, aqueous, solution, the, reactions, are, those, of, nh, 4, and, so, 2, 4, ions, for, example, addition, of, barium, chloride, precipitates, out, barium, sulfate, the, filtrate, on, evaporation, yields, ammonium, chloride, ammonium, sulfate, forms, many, double, salts, ammonium, metal, sulfates, when, its, solution, is, mixed, with, equimolar, solutions, of, metal, sulfates, and, the, solution, is, slowly, evaporated, with, trivalent, metal, ions, alums, such, as, ferric, ammonium, sulfate, are, formed, double, metal, sulfates, include, ammonium, cobaltous, sulfate, ferrous, diammonium, sulfate, ammonium, nickel, sulfate, which, are, known, as, tutton, s, salts, and, ammonium, ceric, sulfate, anhydrous, double, sulfates, of, ammonium, also, occur, in, the, langbeinites, family, the, ammonia, produced, has, a, pungent, smell, and, is, toxic, airborne, particles, of, evaporated, ammonium, sulfate, comprise, approximately, 30, of, fine, particulate, pollution, worldwide, in, november, 2009, a, ban, on, ammonium, sulfate, ammonium, nitrate, and, calcium, ammonium, nitrate, fertilizers, was, imposed, in, the, former, malakand, division, comprising, the, upper, dir, lower, dir, swat, chitral, and, malakand, districts, of, the, north, west, frontier, province, nwfp, of, pakistan, by, the, nwfp, government, following, reports, that, they, were, used, by, militants, to, make, explosives, in, january, 2010, these, substances, were, also, banned, in, afghanistan, for, the, same, reason
