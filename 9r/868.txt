blue, is, one, of, the, three, primary, colours, in, the, ryb, colour, model, traditional, colour, theory, as, well, as, in, the, rgb, additive, colour, model, it, lies, between, violet, and, cyan, on, the, spectrum, of, visible, light, the, term, blue, generally, describes, colours, perceived, by, humans, observing, light, with, a, dominant, wavelength, that, s, between, approximately, 450, and, 495, nanometres, most, blues, contain, a, slight, mixture, of, other, colours, azure, contains, some, green, while, ultramarine, contains, some, violet, the, clear, daytime, sky, and, the, deep, sea, appear, blue, because, of, an, optical, effect, known, as, rayleigh, scattering, an, optical, effect, called, the, tyndall, effect, explains, blue, eyes, distant, objects, appear, more, blue, because, of, another, optical, effect, called, aerial, perspective, blue, has, been, an, important, colour, in, art, and, decoration, since, ancient, times, the, semi, precious, stone, lapis, lazuli, was, used, in, ancient, egypt, for, jewellery, and, ornament, and, later, in, the, renaissance, to, make, the, pigment, ultramarine, the, most, expensive, of, all, pigments, in, the, eighth, century, chinese, artists, used, cobalt, blue, to, colour, fine, blue, and, white, porcelain, in, the, middle, ages, european, artists, used, it, in, the, windows, of, cathedrals, europeans, wore, clothing, coloured, with, the, vegetable, dye, woad, until, it, was, replaced, by, the, finer, indigo, from, america, in, the, 19th, century, synthetic, blue, dyes, and, pigments, gradually, replaced, organic, dyes, and, mineral, pigments, dark, blue, became, a, common, colour, for, military, uniforms, and, later, in, the, late, 20th, century, for, business, suits, because, blue, has, commonly, been, associated, with, harmony, it, was, chosen, as, the, colour, of, the, flags, of, the, united, nations, and, the, european, union, in, the, united, states, and, europe, blue, is, the, colour, that, both, men, and, women, are, most, likely, to, choose, as, their, favourite, with, at, least, one, recent, survey, showing, the, same, across, several, other, countries, including, china, malaysia, and, indonesia, past, surveys, in, the, us, and, europe, have, found, that, blue, is, the, colour, most, commonly, associated, with, harmony, confidence, masculinity, knowledge, intelligence, calmness, distance, infinity, the, imagination, cold, and, sadness, the, modern, english, word, blue, comes, from, middle, english, bleu, or, blewe, from, the, old, french, bleu, a, word, of, germanic, origin, related, to, the, old, high, german, word, blao, meaning, shimmering, lustrous, in, heraldry, the, word, azure, is, used, for, blue, in, russian, spanish, mongolian, irish, and, some, other, languages, there, is, no, single, word, for, blue, but, rather, different, words, for, light, blue, goluboj, celeste, and, dark, blue, sinij, azul, see, colour, term, several, languages, including, japanese, and, lakota, sioux, use, the, same, word, to, describe, blue, and, green, for, example, in, vietnamese, the, colour, of, both, tree, leaves, and, the, sky, is, xanh, in, japanese, the, word, for, blue, ao, is, often, used, for, colours, that, english, speakers, would, refer, to, as, green, such, as, the, colour, of, a, traffic, signal, meaning, go, in, lakota, the, word, t, is, used, for, both, blue, and, green, the, two, colours, not, being, distinguished, in, older, lakota, for, more, on, this, subject, see, blue, green, distinction, in, language, linguistic, research, indicates, that, languages, do, not, begin, by, having, a, word, for, the, colour, blue, colour, names, often, developed, individually, in, natural, languages, typically, beginning, with, black, and, white, or, dark, and, light, and, then, adding, red, and, only, much, later, usually, as, the, last, main, category, of, colour, accepted, in, a, language, adding, the, colour, blue, probably, when, blue, pigments, could, be, manufactured, reliably, in, the, culture, using, that, language, the, term, blue, generally, describes, colours, perceived, by, humans, observing, light, with, a, dominant, wavelength, between, approximately, 450, and, 495, nanometres, blues, with, a, higher, frequency, and, thus, a, shorter, wavelength, gradually, look, more, violet, while, those, with, a, lower, frequency, and, a, longer, wavelength, gradually, appear, more, green, purer, blues, are, in, the, middle, of, this, range, e, g, around, 470, nanometres, isaac, newton, included, blue, as, one, of, the, seven, colours, in, his, first, description, of, the, visible, spectrum, he, chose, seven, colours, because, that, was, the, number, of, notes, in, the, musical, scale, which, he, believed, was, related, to, the, optical, spectrum, he, included, indigo, the, hue, between, blue, and, violet, as, one, of, the, separate, colours, though, today, it, is, usually, considered, a, hue, of, blue, in, painting, and, traditional, colour, theory, blue, is, one, of, the, three, primary, colours, of, pigments, red, yellow, blue, which, can, be, mixed, to, form, a, wide, gamut, of, colours, red, and, blue, mixed, together, form, violet, blue, and, yellow, together, form, green, mixing, all, three, primary, colours, together, produces, a, dark, brown, from, the, renaissance, onward, painters, used, this, system, to, create, their, colours, see, ryb, colour, model, the, ryb, model, was, used, for, colour, printing, by, jacob, christoph, le, blon, as, early, as, 1725, later, printers, discovered, that, more, accurate, colours, could, be, created, by, using, combinations, of, cyan, magenta, yellow, and, black, ink, put, onto, separate, inked, plates, and, then, overlaid, one, at, a, time, onto, paper, this, method, could, produce, almost, all, the, colours, in, the, spectrum, with, reasonable, accuracy, on, the, hsv, colour, wheel, the, complement, of, blue, is, yellow, that, is, a, colour, corresponding, to, an, equal, mixture, of, red, and, green, light, on, a, colour, wheel, based, on, traditional, colour, theory, ryb, where, blue, was, considered, a, primary, colour, its, complementary, colour, is, considered, to, be, orange, based, on, the, munsell, colour, wheel, in, 1993, high, brightness, blue, leds, were, demonstrated, by, shuji, nakamura, of, nichia, corporation, in, parallel, isamu, akasaki, and, hiroshi, amano, of, nagoya, university, were, working, on, a, new, development, which, revolutionized, led, lighting, nakamura, was, awarded, the, 2006, millennium, technology, prize, for, his, invention, nakamura, hiroshi, amano, and, isamu, akasaki, were, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 2014, for, the, invention, of, an, efficient, blue, led, lasers, emitting, in, the, blue, region, of, the, spectrum, became, widely, available, to, the, public, in, 2010, with, the, release, of, inexpensive, high, powered, 445, 447, nm, laser, diode, technology, previously, the, blue, wavelengths, were, accessible, only, through, dpss, which, are, comparatively, expensive, and, inefficient, but, still, widely, used, by, scientists, for, applications, including, optogenetics, raman, spectroscopy, and, particle, image, velocimetry, due, to, their, superior, beam, quality, blue, gas, lasers, are, also, still, commonly, used, for, holography, dna, sequencing, optical, pumping, among, other, scientific, and, medical, applications, blue, is, the, colour, of, light, between, violet, and, cyan, on, the, visible, spectrum, hues, of, blue, include, indigo, and, ultramarine, closer, to, violet, pure, blue, without, any, mixture, of, other, colours, azure, which, is, a, lighter, shade, of, blue, similar, to, the, colour, of, the, sky, cyan, which, is, midway, in, the, spectrum, between, blue, and, green, and, the, other, blue, greens, such, as, turquoise, teal, and, aquamarine, blue, also, varies, in, shade, or, tint, darker, shades, of, blue, contain, black, or, grey, while, lighter, tints, contain, white, darker, shades, of, blue, include, ultramarine, cobalt, blue, navy, blue, and, prussian, blue, while, lighter, tints, include, sky, blue, azure, and, egyptian, blue, for, a, more, complete, list, see, the, list, of, colours, in, nature, many, blue, phenomena, arise, from, structural, colouration, the, result, of, interference, between, reflections, from, two, or, more, surfaces, of, thin, films, combined, with, refraction, as, light, enters, and, exits, such, films, the, geometry, then, determines, that, at, certain, angles, the, light, reflected, from, both, surfaces, interferes, constructively, while, at, other, angles, the, light, interferes, destructively, diverse, colours, therefore, appear, despite, the, absence, of, colourants, egyptian, blue, the, first, artificial, pigment, was, produced, in, the, third, millennium, bc, in, ancient, egypt, it, is, produced, by, heating, pulverized, sand, copper, and, natron, it, was, used, in, tomb, paintings, and, funereal, objects, to, protect, the, dead, in, their, afterlife, prior, to, the, 1700s, blue, colourants, for, artwork, were, mainly, based, on, lapis, lazuli, and, the, related, mineral, ultramarine, a, breakthrough, occurred, in, 1709, when, german, druggist, and, pigment, maker, johann, jacob, diesbach, discovered, prussian, blue, the, new, blue, arose, from, experiments, involving, heating, dried, blood, with, iron, sulphides, and, was, initially, called, berliner, blau, by, 1710, it, was, being, used, by, the, french, painter, antoine, watteau, and, later, his, successor, nicolas, lancret, it, became, immensely, popular, for, the, manufacture, of, wallpaper, and, in, the, 19th, century, was, widely, used, by, french, impressionist, painters, beginning, in, the, 1820s, prussian, blue, was, imported, into, japan, through, the, port, of, nagasaki, it, was, called, bero, ai, or, berlin, blue, and, it, became, popular, because, it, did, not, fade, like, traditional, japanese, blue, pigment, ai, gami, made, from, the, dayflower, prussian, blue, was, used, by, both, hokusai, in, his, wave, paintings, and, hiroshige, in, 1799, a, french, chemist, louis, jacques, th, nard, made, a, synthetic, cobalt, blue, pigment, which, became, immensely, popular, with, painters, in, 1824, the, societ, pour, l, encouragement, d, industrie, in, france, offered, a, prize, for, the, invention, of, an, artificial, ultramarine, which, could, rival, the, natural, colour, made, from, lapis, lazuli, the, prize, was, won, in, 1826, by, a, chemist, named, jean, baptiste, guimet, but, he, refused, to, reveal, the, formula, of, his, colour, in, 1828, another, scientist, christian, gmelin, then, a, professor, of, chemistry, in, t, bingen, found, the, process, and, published, his, formula, this, was, the, beginning, of, new, industry, to, manufacture, artificial, ultramarine, which, eventually, almost, completely, replaced, the, natural, product, in, 1878, german, chemists, synthesized, indigo, this, product, rapidly, replaced, natural, indigo, wiping, out, vast, farms, growing, indigo, it, is, now, the, blue, of, blue, jeans, as, the, pace, of, organic, chemistry, accelerated, a, succession, of, synthetic, blue, dyes, were, discovered, including, indanthrone, blue, which, had, even, greater, resistance, to, fading, during, washing, or, in, the, sun, and, copper, phthalocyanine, blue, dyes, are, organic, compounds, both, synthetic, and, natural, woad, and, true, indigo, were, once, used, but, since, the, early, 1900s, all, indigo, is, synthetic, produced, on, an, industrial, scale, indigo, is, the, blue, of, blue, jeans, for, food, the, triarylmethane, dye, brilliant, blue, fcf, is, used, for, candies, the, search, continues, for, stable, natural, blue, dyes, suitable, for, the, food, industry, blue, pigments, were, once, produced, from, minerals, especially, lapis, lazuli, and, its, close, relative, ultramarine, these, minerals, were, crushed, ground, into, powder, and, then, mixed, with, a, quick, drying, binding, agent, such, as, egg, yolk, tempera, painting, or, with, a, slow, drying, oil, such, as, linseed, oil, for, oil, painting, two, inorganic, but, synthetic, blue, pigments, are, cerulean, blue, primarily, cobalt, ii, stanate, co, 2, sno, 4, and, prussian, blue, milori, blue, primarily, fe, 7, cn, 18, the, chromophore, in, blue, glass, and, glazes, is, cobalt, ii, diverse, cobalt, ii, salts, such, as, cobalt, carbonate, or, cobalt, ii, aluminate, are, mixed, with, the, silica, prior, to, firing, the, cobalt, occupies, sites, otherwise, filled, with, silicon, methyl, blue, is, the, dominant, blue, pigment, in, inks, used, in, pens, blueprinting, involves, the, production, of, prussian, blue, in, situ, certain, metal, ions, characteristically, form, blue, solutions, or, blue, salts, of, some, practical, importance, cobalt, is, used, to, make, the, deep, blue, glazes, and, glasses, it, substitutes, for, silicon, or, aluminum, ions, in, these, materials, cobalt, is, the, blue, chromophore, in, stained, glass, windows, such, as, those, in, gothic, cathedrals, and, in, chinese, porcelain, beginning, in, the, tang, dynasty, copper, ii, cu, 2, also, produces, many, blue, compounds, including, the, commercial, algicide, copper, ii, sulfate, cuso, 4, 5h, 2, o, similarly, vanadyl, salts, and, solutions, are, often, blue, e, g, vanadyl, sulfate, when, sunlight, passes, through, the, atmosphere, the, blue, wavelengths, are, scattered, more, widely, by, the, oxygen, and, nitrogen, molecules, and, more, blue, comes, to, our, eyes, this, effect, is, called, rayleigh, scattering, after, lord, rayleigh, and, confirmed, by, albert, einstein, in, 1911, the, sea, is, seen, as, blue, for, largely, the, same, reason, the, water, absorbs, the, longer, wavelengths, of, red, and, reflects, and, scatters, the, blue, which, comes, to, the, eye, of, the, viewer, the, deeper, the, observer, goes, the, darker, the, blue, becomes, in, the, open, sea, only, about, 1, of, light, penetrates, to, a, depth, of, 200, metres, see, underwater, and, euphotic, depth, the, colour, of, the, sea, is, also, affected, by, the, colour, of, the, sky, reflected, by, particles, in, the, water, and, by, algae, and, plant, life, in, the, water, which, can, make, it, look, green, or, by, sediment, which, can, make, it, look, brown, the, farther, away, an, object, is, the, more, blue, it, often, appears, to, the, eye, for, example, mountains, in, the, distance, often, appear, blue, this, is, the, effect, of, atmospheric, perspective, the, farther, an, object, is, away, from, the, viewer, the, less, contrast, there, is, between, the, object, and, its, background, colour, which, is, usually, blue, in, a, painting, where, different, parts, of, the, composition, are, blue, green, and, red, the, blue, will, appear, to, be, more, distant, and, the, red, closer, to, the, viewer, the, cooler, a, colour, is, the, more, distant, it, seems, blue, light, is, scattered, more, than, other, wavelengths, by, the, gases, in, the, atmosphere, hence, our, blue, planet, some, of, the, most, desirable, gems, are, blue, including, sapphire, and, tanzanite, compounds, of, copper, ii, are, characteristically, blue, and, so, are, many, copper, containing, minerals, azurite, cu, 3, co, 3, 2, oh, 2, with, a, deep, blue, colour, was, once, employed, in, medieval, years, but, it, is, unstable, pigment, losing, its, colour, especially, under, dry, conditions, lapis, lazuli, mined, in, afghanistan, for, more, than, three, thousand, years, was, used, for, jewelry, and, ornaments, and, later, was, crushed, and, powdered, and, used, as, a, pigment, the, more, it, was, ground, the, lighter, the, blue, colour, became, natural, ultramarine, made, by, grinding, lapis, lazuli, into, a, fine, powder, was, the, finest, available, blue, pigment, in, the, middle, ages, and, the, renaissance, it, was, extremely, expensive, and, in, italian, renaissance, art, it, was, often, reserved, for, the, robes, of, the, virgin, mary, intense, efforts, have, focused, on, blue, flowers, and, the, possibility, that, natural, blue, colourants, could, be, used, as, food, dyes, commonly, blue, colours, in, plants, are, anthocyanins, the, largest, group, of, water, soluble, pigments, found, widespread, in, the, plant, kingdom, in, the, few, plants, that, exploit, structural, colouration, brilliant, colours, are, produced, by, structures, within, cells, the, most, brilliant, blue, colouration, known, in, any, living, tissue, is, found, in, the, marble, berries, of, pollia, condensata, where, a, spiral, structure, of, cellulose, fibrils, scattering, blue, light, the, fruit, of, quandong, santalum, acuminatum, can, appear, blue, owing, to, the, same, effect, blue, pigmented, animals, are, relatively, rare, examples, of, which, include, butterflies, of, the, genus, nessaea, where, blue, is, created, by, pterobilin, other, blue, pigments, of, animal, origin, include, phorcabilin, used, by, other, butterflies, in, graphium, and, papilio, specifically, p, phorcas, and, p, weiskei, and, sarpedobilin, which, is, used, by, graphium, sarpedon, blue, pigmented, organelles, known, as, cyanosomes, exist, in, the, chromatophores, of, at, least, two, fish, species, the, mandarin, fish, and, the, picturesque, dragonet, more, commonly, blueness, in, animals, is, a, structural, colouration, an, optical, interference, effect, induced, by, organized, nanometre, sized, scales, or, fibres, examples, include, the, plumage, of, several, birds, like, the, blue, jay, and, indigo, bunting, the, scales, of, butterflies, like, the, morpho, butterfly, collagen, fibres, in, the, skin, of, some, species, of, monkey, and, opossum, and, the, iridophore, cells, in, some, fish, and, frogs, blue, eyes, do, not, actually, contain, any, blue, pigment, eye, colour, is, determined, by, two, factors, the, pigmentation, of, the, eye, s, iris, and, the, scattering, of, light, by, the, turbid, medium, in, the, stroma, of, the, iris, in, humans, the, pigmentation, of, the, iris, varies, from, light, brown, to, black, the, appearance, of, blue, green, and, hazel, eyes, results, from, the, tyndall, scattering, of, light, in, the, stroma, an, optical, effect, similar, to, what, accounts, for, the, blueness, of, the, sky, the, irises, of, the, eyes, of, people, with, blue, eyes, contain, less, dark, melanin, than, those, of, people, with, brown, eyes, which, means, that, they, absorb, less, short, wavelength, blue, light, which, is, instead, reflected, out, to, the, viewer, eye, colour, also, varies, depending, on, the, lighting, conditions, especially, for, lighter, coloured, eyes, blue, eyes, are, most, common, in, ireland, the, baltic, sea, area, and, northern, europe, and, are, also, found, in, eastern, central, and, southern, europe, blue, eyes, are, also, found, in, parts, of, western, asia, most, notably, in, afghanistan, syria, iraq, and, iran, in, estonia, 99, of, people, have, blue, eyes, in, denmark, in, 1978, only, 8, of, the, population, had, brown, eyes, though, through, immigration, today, that, number, is, about, 11, in, germany, about, 75, have, blue, eyes, in, the, united, states, as, of, 2006, 1, out, of, every, 6, people, or, 16, 6, of, the, total, population, and, 22, 3, of, the, white, population, have, blue, eyes, compared, with, about, half, of, americans, born, in, 1900, and, a, third, of, americans, born, in, 1950, blue, eyes, are, becoming, less, common, among, american, children, in, the, us, males, are, 3, 5, more, likely, to, have, blue, eyes, than, females, as, early, as, the, 7th, millennium, bc, lapis, lazuli, was, mined, in, the, sar, i, sang, mines, in, shortugai, and, in, other, mines, in, badakhshan, province, in, northeast, afghanistan, lapis, lazuli, artifacts, dated, to, 7570, bc, have, been, found, at, bhirrana, which, is, the, oldest, site, of, indus, valley, civilisation, lapis, was, highly, valued, by, the, indus, valley, civilisation, 7570, 1900, bc, lapis, beads, have, been, found, at, neolithic, burials, in, mehrgarh, the, caucasus, and, as, far, away, as, mauritania, it, was, used, in, the, funeral, mask, of, tutankhamun, 1341, 1323, bc, a, term, for, blue, was, relatively, rare, in, many, forms, of, ancient, art, and, decoration, and, even, in, ancient, literature, the, ancient, greek, poets, described, the, sea, as, green, brown, or, the, colour, of, wine, the, colour, is, mentioned, several, times, in, the, hebrew, bible, as, tekhelet, reds, blacks, browns, and, ochres, are, found, in, cave, paintings, from, the, upper, paleolithic, period, but, not, blue, blue, was, also, not, used, for, dyeing, fabric, until, long, after, red, ochre, pink, and, purple, this, is, probably, due, to, the, perennial, difficulty, of, making, blue, dyes, and, pigments, on, the, other, hand, the, rarity, of, blue, pigment, made, it, even, more, valuable, the, earliest, known, blue, dyes, were, made, from, plants, woad, in, europe, indigo, in, asia, and, africa, while, blue, pigments, were, made, from, minerals, usually, either, lapis, lazuli, or, azurite, and, required, more, blue, glazes, posed, still, another, challenge, since, the, early, blue, dyes, and, pigments, were, not, thermally, robust, in, c, 2500, bc, the, blue, glaze, egyptian, blue, was, introduced, for, ceramics, as, well, as, many, other, objects, the, greeks, imported, indigo, dye, from, india, calling, it, indikon, and, they, painted, with, egyptian, blue, blue, was, not, one, of, the, four, primary, colours, for, greek, painting, described, by, pliny, the, elder, red, yellow, black, and, white, for, the, romans, blue, was, the, colour, of, mourning, as, well, as, the, colour, of, barbarians, the, celts, and, germans, reportedly, dyed, their, faces, blue, to, frighten, their, enemies, and, tinted, their, hair, blue, when, they, grew, old, the, romans, made, extensive, use, of, indigo, and, egyptian, blue, pigment, as, evidenced, in, part, by, frescos, in, pompeii, the, romans, had, many, words, for, varieties, of, blue, including, caeruleus, caesius, glaucus, cyaneus, lividus, venetus, aerius, and, ferreus, but, two, words, both, of, foreign, origin, became, the, most, enduring, blavus, from, the, germanic, word, blau, which, eventually, became, bleu, or, blue, and, azureus, from, the, arabic, word, lazaward, which, became, azure, blue, was, widely, used, in, the, decoration, of, churches, in, the, byzantine, empire, by, contrast, in, the, islamic, world, blue, was, of, secondary, to, green, believed, to, be, the, favourite, colour, of, the, prophet, mohammed, at, certain, times, in, moorish, spain, and, other, parts, of, the, islamic, world, blue, was, the, colour, worn, by, christians, and, jews, because, only, muslims, were, allowed, to, wear, white, and, green, in, the, art, and, life, of, europe, during, the, early, middle, ages, blue, played, a, minor, role, this, changed, dramatically, between, 1130, and, 1140, in, paris, when, the, abbe, suger, rebuilt, the, saint, denis, basilica, suger, considered, that, light, was, the, visible, manifestation, of, the, holy, spirit, he, installed, stained, glass, windows, coloured, with, cobalt, which, combined, with, the, light, from, the, red, glass, filled, the, church, with, a, bluish, violet, light, the, church, became, the, marvel, of, the, christian, world, and, the, colour, became, known, as, the, bleu, de, saint, denis, in, the, years, that, followed, even, more, elegant, blue, stained, glass, windows, were, installed, in, other, churches, including, at, chartres, cathedral, and, sainte, chapelle, in, paris, in, the, 12th, century, the, roman, catholic, church, dictated, that, painters, in, italy, and, the, rest, of, europe, consequently, to, paint, the, virgin, mary, with, blue, which, became, associated, with, holiness, humility, and, virtue, in, medieval, paintings, blue, was, used, to, attract, the, attention, of, the, viewer, to, the, virgin, mary, paintings, of, the, mythical, king, arthur, began, to, show, him, dressed, in, blue, the, coat, of, arms, of, the, kings, of, france, became, an, azure, or, light, blue, shield, sprinkled, with, golden, fleur, de, lis, or, lilies, blue, had, come, from, obscurity, to, become, the, royal, colour, blue, came, into, wider, use, beginning, in, the, renaissance, when, artists, began, to, paint, the, world, with, perspective, depth, shadows, and, light, from, a, single, source, in, renaissance, paintings, artists, tried, to, create, harmonies, between, blue, and, red, lightening, the, blue, with, lead, white, paint, and, adding, shadows, and, highlights, raphael, was, a, master, of, this, technique, carefully, balancing, the, reds, and, the, blues, so, no, one, colour, dominated, the, picture, ultramarine, was, the, most, prestigious, blue, of, the, renaissance, being, more, expensive, than, gold, wealthy, art, patrons, commissioned, works, with, the, most, expensive, blues, possible, in, 1616, richard, sackville, commissioned, a, portrait, of, himself, by, isaac, oliver, with, three, different, blues, including, ultramarine, pigment, for, his, stockings, an, industry, for, the, manufacture, of, fine, blue, and, white, pottery, began, in, the, 14th, century, in, jingdezhen, china, using, white,
