micas, m, a, k, z, my, k, z, are, a, group, of, silicate, minerals, whose, outstanding, physical, characteristic, is, that, individual, mica, crystals, can, easily, be, split, into, extremely, thin, elastic, plates, this, characteristic, is, described, as, perfect, basal, cleavage, mica, is, common, in, igneous, and, metamorphic, rock, and, is, occasionally, found, as, small, flakes, in, sedimentary, rock, it, is, particularly, prominent, in, many, granites, pegmatites, and, schists, and, books, large, individual, crystals, of, mica, several, feet, across, have, been, found, in, some, pegmatites, micas, are, used, in, products, such, as, drywalls, paints, fillers, especially, in, parts, for, automobiles, roofing, and, shingles, as, well, as, in, electronics, the, mineral, is, used, in, cosmetics, and, food, to, add, shimmer, or, frost, the, mica, group, is, composed, of, 37, phyllosilicate, minerals, all, crystallize, in, the, monoclinic, system, with, a, tendency, towards, pseudohexagonal, crystals, and, are, similar, in, structure, but, vary, in, chemical, composition, micas, are, translucent, to, opaque, with, a, distinct, vitreous, or, pearly, luster, and, different, mica, minerals, display, colors, ranging, from, white, to, green, or, red, to, black, deposits, of, mica, tend, to, have, a, flaky, or, platy, appearance, the, crystal, structure, of, mica, is, described, as, tot, c, meaning, that, it, is, composed, of, parallel, tot, layers, weakly, bonded, to, each, other, by, cations, c, the, tot, layers, in, turn, consist, of, two, tetrahedral, sheets, t, strongly, bonded, to, the, two, faces, of, a, single, octahedral, sheet, o, it, is, the, relatively, weak, ionic, bonding, between, tot, layers, that, gives, mica, its, perfect, basal, cleavage, the, tetrahedral, sheets, consist, of, silica, tetrahedra, each, silicon, ion, surrounded, by, four, oxygen, ions, in, most, micas, one, in, four, silicon, ions, is, replaced, by, an, aluminium, ion, while, half, the, silicon, ions, are, replaced, by, aluminium, ions, in, brittle, micas, the, tetrahedra, each, share, three, of, their, four, oxygen, ions, with, neighboring, tetrahedra, to, produce, a, hexagonal, sheet, the, remaining, oxygen, ion, the, apical, oxygen, ion, is, available, to, bond, with, the, octahedral, sheet, the, octahedral, sheet, can, be, dioctahedral, or, trioctahedral, a, trioctahedral, sheet, has, the, structure, of, a, sheet, of, the, mineral, brucite, with, magnesium, or, ferrous, iron, being, the, most, common, cation, a, dioctahedral, sheet, has, the, structure, and, typically, the, composition, of, a, gibbsite, sheet, with, aluminium, being, the, cation, apical, oxygens, take, the, place, of, some, of, the, hydroxyl, ions, that, would, be, present, in, a, brucite, or, gibbsite, sheet, bonding, the, tetrahedral, sheets, tightly, to, the, octahedral, sheet, tetrahedral, sheets, have, a, strong, negative, charge, since, their, bulk, composition, is, alsi, 3, o, 10, 5, the, octahedral, sheet, has, a, positive, charge, since, its, bulk, composition, is, al, oh, 2, for, a, dioctahedral, sheet, with, the, apical, sites, vacant, or, m, 3, oh, 2, 4, for, a, trioctahedral, site, with, the, apical, sites, vacant, m, represents, a, divalent, ion, such, as, ferrous, iron, or, magnesium, the, combined, tot, layer, has, a, residual, negative, charge, since, its, bulk, composition, is, al, 2, alsi, 3, o, 10, oh, 2, or, m, 3, alsi, 3, o, 10, oh, 2, the, remaining, negative, charge, of, the, tot, layer, is, neutralized, by, the, interlayer, cations, typically, sodium, potassium, or, calcium, ions, because, the, hexagons, in, the, t, and, o, sheets, are, slightly, different, in, size, the, sheets, are, slightly, distorted, when, they, bond, into, a, tot, layer, this, breaks, the, hexagonal, symmetry, and, reduces, it, to, monoclinic, symmetry, however, the, original, hexahedral, symmetry, is, discernible, in, the, pseudohexagonal, character, of, mica, crystals, the, short, range, order, of, k, ions, on, cleaved, muscovite, mica, has, been, resolved, chemically, micas, can, be, given, the, general, formula, in, which, structurally, micas, can, be, classed, as, dioctahedral, y, 4, and, trioctahedral, y, 6, if, the, x, ion, is, k, or, na, the, mica, is, a, common, mica, whereas, if, the, x, ion, is, ca, the, mica, is, classed, as, a, brittle, mica, brittle, micas, common, micas, brittle, micas, very, fine, grained, micas, which, typically, show, more, variation, in, ion, and, water, content, are, informally, termed, clay, micas, they, include, sericite, is, the, name, given, to, very, fine, ragged, grains, and, aggregates, of, white, colourless, micas, mica, is, widely, distributed, and, occurs, in, igneous, metamorphic, and, sedimentary, regimes, large, crystals, of, mica, used, for, various, applications, are, typically, mined, from, granitic, pegmatites, the, largest, documented, single, crystal, of, mica, phlogopite,
