hafnium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, hf, and, atomic, number, 72, a, lustrous, silvery, gray, tetravalent, transition, metal, hafnium, chemically, resembles, zirconium, and, is, found, in, many, zirconium, minerals, its, existence, was, predicted, by, dmitri, mendeleev, in, 1869, though, it, was, not, identified, until, 1922, by, dirk, coster, and, george, de, hevesy, hafnium, is, named, after, hafnia, the, latin, name, for, copenhagen, where, it, was, discovered, hafnium, is, used, in, filaments, and, electrodes, some, semiconductor, fabrication, processes, use, its, oxide, for, integrated, circuits, at, 45, nanometers, and, smaller, feature, lengths, some, superalloys, used, for, special, applications, contain, hafnium, in, combination, with, niobium, titanium, or, tungsten, hafnium, s, large, neutron, capture, cross, section, makes, it, a, good, material, for, neutron, absorption, in, control, rods, in, nuclear, power, plants, but, at, the, same, time, requires, that, it, be, removed, from, the, neutron, transparent, corrosion, resistant, zirconium, alloys, used, in, nuclear, reactors, hafnium, is, a, shiny, silvery, ductile, metal, that, is, corrosion, resistant, and, chemically, similar, to, zirconium, in, that, they, have, the, same, number, of, valence, electrons, and, are, in, the, same, group, also, their, relativistic, effects, are, similar, the, expected, expansion, of, atomic, radii, from, period, 5, to, 6, is, almost, exactly, canceled, out, by, the, lanthanide, contraction, hafnium, changes, from, its, alpha, form, a, hexagonal, close, packed, lattice, to, its, beta, form, a, body, centered, cubic, lattice, at, 2388, k, the, physical, properties, of, hafnium, metal, samples, are, markedly, affected, by, zirconium, impurities, especially, the, nuclear, properties, as, these, two, elements, are, among, the, most, difficult, to, separate, because, of, their, chemical, similarity, a, notable, physical, difference, between, these, metals, is, their, density, with, zirconium, having, about, one, half, the, density, of, hafnium, the, most, notable, nuclear, properties, of, hafnium, are, its, high, thermal, neutron, capture, cross, section, and, that, the, nuclei, of, several, different, hafnium, isotopes, readily, absorb, two, or, more, neutrons, apiece, in, contrast, with, this, zirconium, is, practically, transparent, to, thermal, neutrons, and, it, is, commonly, used, for, the, metal, components, of, nuclear, reactors, especially, the, cladding, of, their, nuclear, fuel, rods, hafnium, reacts, in, air, to, form, a, protective, film, that, inhibits, further, corrosion, despite, this, the, metal, is, attacked, by, hydrofluoric, acid, and, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, and, can, be, oxidized, with, halogens, or, burnt, in, air, like, its, sister, metal, zirconium, finely, divided, hafnium, can, ignite, spontaneously, in, air, the, metal, is, resistant, to, concentrated, alkalis, as, a, consequence, of, lanthanide, contraction, the, chemistry, of, hafnium, and, zirconium, is, so, similar, that, the, two, cannot, be, separated, based, on, differing, chemical, reactions, the, melting, and, boiling, points, of, the, compounds, and, the, solubility, in, solvents, are, the, major, differences, in, the, chemistry, of, these, twin, elements, at, least, 40, isotopes, of, hafnium, have, been, observed, ranging, in, mass, number, from, 153, to, 192, the, five, stable, isotopes, have, mass, numbers, ranging, from, 176, to, 180, inclusive, the, radioactive, isotopes, half, lives, range, from, 400, ms, for, 153, hf, to, 7, 0, 10, 16, years, for, the, most, stable, one, the, primordial, 174, hf, the, extinct, radionuclide, 182, hf, has, a, half, life, of, 8, 9, 0, 1, million, years, and, is, an, important, tracker, isotope, for, the, formation, of, planetary, cores, the, nuclear, isomer, 178m2, hf, was, at, the, center, of, a, controversy, for, several, years, regarding, its, potential, use, as, a, weapon, hafnium, is, estimated, to, make, up, about, between, 3, 0, and, 4, 8, ppm, of, the, earth, s, upper, crust, by, mass, 5, it, does, not, exist, as, a, free, element, on, earth, but, is, found, combined, in, solid, solution, with, zirconium, in, natural, zirconium, compounds, such, as, zircon, zrsio, 4, which, usually, has, about, 1, 4, of, the, zr, replaced, by, hf, rarely, the, hf, zr, ratio, increases, during, crystallization, to, give, the, isostructural, mineral, hafnon, hf, zr, sio, 4, with, atomic, hf, zr, an, obsolete, name, for, a, variety, of, zircon, containing, unusually, high, hf, content, is, alvite, a, major, source, of, zircon, and, hence, hafnium, ores, is, heavy, mineral, sands, ore, deposits, pegmatites, particularly, in, brazil, and, malawi, and, carbonatite, intrusions, particularly, the, crown, polymetallic, deposit, at, mount, weld, western, australia, a, potential, source, of, hafnium, is, trachyte, tuffs, containing, rare, zircon, hafnium, silicates, eudialyte, or, armstrongite, at, dubbo, in, new, south, wales, australia, the, heavy, mineral, sands, ore, deposits, of, the, titanium, ores, ilmenite, and, rutile, yield, most, of, the, mined, zirconium, and, therefore, also, most, of, the, hafnium, zirconium, is, a, good, nuclear, fuel, rod, cladding, metal, with, the, desirable, properties, of, a, very, low, neutron, capture, cross, section, and, good, chemical, stability, at, high, temperatures, however, because, of, hafnium, s, neutron, absorbing, properties, hafnium, impurities, in, zirconium, would, cause, it, to, be, far, less, useful, for, nuclear, reactor, applications, thus, a, nearly, complete, separation, of, zirconium, and, hafnium, is, necessary, for, their, use, in, nuclear, power, the, production, of, hafnium, free, zirconium, is, the, main, source, of, hafnium, the, chemical, properties, of, hafnium, and, zirconium, are, nearly, identical, which, makes, the, two, difficult, to, separate, the, methods, first, used, fractional, crystallization, of, ammonium, fluoride, salts, or, the, fractional, distillation, of, the, chloride, have, not, proven, suitable, for, an, industrial, scale, production, after, zirconium, was, chosen, as, a, material, for, nuclear, reactor, programs, in, the, 1940s, a, separation, method, had, to, be, developed, liquid, liquid, extraction, processes, with, a, wide, variety, of, solvents, were, developed, and, are, still, used, for, producing, hafnium, about, half, of, all, hafnium, metal, manufactured, is, produced, as, a, by, product, of, zirconium, refinement, the, end, product, of, the, separation, is, hafnium, iv, chloride, the, purified, hafnium, iv, chloride, is, converted, to, the, metal, by, reduction, with, magnesium, or, sodium, as, in, the, kroll, process, further, purification, is, effected, by, a, chemical, transport, reaction, developed, by, arkel, and, de, boer, in, a, closed, vessel, hafnium, reacts, with, iodine, at, temperatures, of, 500, c, 900, f, forming, hafnium, iv, iodide, at, a, tungsten, filament, of, 1, 700, c, 3, 100, f, the, reverse, reaction, happens, preferentially, and, the, chemically, bound, iodine, and, hafnium, dissociate, into, the, native, elements, the, hafnium, forms, a, solid, coating, at, the, tungsten, filament, and, the, iodine, can, react, with, additional, hafnium, resulting, in, a, steady, iodine, turnover, and, ensuring, the, chemical, equilibrium, remains, in, favor, of, hafnium, production, due, to, the, lanthanide, contraction, the, ionic, radius, of, hafnium, iv, 0, 78, ngstr, m, is, almost, the, same, as, that, of, zirconium, iv, 0, 79, angstroms, consequently, compounds, of, hafnium, iv, and, zirconium, iv, have, very, similar, chemical, and, physical, properties, hafnium, and, zirconium, tend, to, occur, together, in, nature, and, the, similarity, of, their, ionic, radii, makes, their, chemical, separation, rather, difficult, hafnium, tends, to, form, inorganic, compounds, in, the, oxidation, state, of, 4, halogens, react, with, it, to, form, hafnium, tetrahalides, at, higher, temperatures, hafnium, reacts, with, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, boron, sulfur, and, silicon, some, hafnium, compounds, in, lower, oxidation, states, are, known, hafnium, iv, chloride, and, hafnium, iv, iodide, have, some, applications, in, the, production, and, purification, of, hafnium, metal, they, are, volatile, solids, with, polymeric, structures, these, tetrachlorides, are, precursors, to, various, organohafnium, compounds, such, as, hafnocene, dichloride, and, tetrabenzylhafnium, the, white, hafnium, oxide, hfo, 2, with, a, melting, point, of, 2, 812, c, and, a, boiling, point, of, roughly, 5, 100, c, is, very, similar, to, zirconia, but, slightly, more, basic, hafnium, carbide, is, the, most, refractory, binary, compound, known, with, a, melting, point, over, 3, 890, c, and, hafnium, nitride, is, the, most, refractory, of, all, known, metal, nitrides, with, a, melting, point, of, 3, 310, c, this, has, led, to, proposals, that, hafnium, or, its, carbides, might, be, useful, as, construction, materials, that, are, subjected, to, very, high, temperatures, the, mixed, carbide, tantalum, hafnium, carbide, ta, 4, hfc, 5, possesses, the, highest, melting, point, of, any, currently, known, compound, 4, 263, k, 3, 990, c, 7, 214, f, recent, supercomputer, simulations, suggest, a, hafnium, alloy, with, a, melting, point, of, 4, 400, k, hafnium, s, existence, was, predicted, by, dmitri, mendeleev, in, 1869, in, his, report, on, the, periodic, law, of, the, chemical, elements, in, 1869, dmitri, mendeleev, had, implicitly, predicted, the, existence, of, a, heavier, analog, of, titanium, and, zirconium, at, the, time, of, his, formulation, in, 1871, mendeleev, believed, that, the, elements, were, ordered, by, their, atomic, masses, and, placed, lanthanum, element, 57, in, the, spot, below, zirconium, the, exact, placement, of, the, elements, and, the, location, of, missing, elements, was, done, by, determining, the, specific, weight, of, the, elements, and, comparing, the, chemical, and, physical, properties, the, x, ray, spectroscopy, done, by, henry, moseley, in, 1914, showed, a, direct, dependency, between, spectral, line, and, effective, nuclear, charge, this, led, to, the, nuclear, charge, or, atomic, number, of, an, element, being, used, to, ascertain, its, place, within, the, periodic, table, with, this, method, moseley, determined, the, number, of, lanthanides, and, showed, the, gaps, in, the, atomic, number, sequence, at, numbers, 43, 61, 72, and, 75, the, discovery, of, the, gaps, led, to, an, extensive, search, for, the, missing, elements, in, 1914, several, people, claimed, the, discovery, after, henry, moseley, predicted, the, gap, in, the, periodic, table, for, the, then, undiscovered, element, 72, georges, urbain, asserted, that, he, found, element, 72, in, the, rare, earth, elements, in, 1907, and, published, his, results, on, celtium, in, 1911, neither, the, spectra, nor, the, chemical, behavior, he, claimed, matched, with, the, element, found, later, and, therefore, his, claim, was, turned, down, after, a, long, standing, controversy, the, controversy, was, partly, because, the, chemists, favored, the, chemical, techniques, which, led, to, the, discovery, of, celtium, while, the, physicists, relied, on, the, use, of, the, new, x, ray, spectroscopy, method, that, proved, that, the, substances, discovered, by, urbain, did, not, contain, element, 72, in, 1921, charles, r, bury, suggested, that, element, 72, should, resemble, zirconium, and, therefore, was, not, part, of, the, rare, earth, elements, group, by, early, 1923, niels, bohr, and, others, agreed, with, bury, these, suggestions, were, based, on, bohr, s, theories, of, the, atom, which, were, identical, to, chemist, charles, bury, the, x, ray, spectroscopy, of, moseley, and, the, chemical, arguments, of, friedrich, paneth, encouraged, by, these, suggestions, and, by, the, reappearance, in, 1922, of, urbain, s, claims, that, element, 72, was, a, rare, earth, element, discovered, in, 1911, dirk, coster, and, georg, von, hevesy, were, motivated, to, search, for, the, new, element, in, zirconium, ores, hafnium, was, discovered, by, the, two, in, 1923, in, copenhagen, denmark, validating, the, original, 1869, prediction, of, mendeleev, it, was, ultimately, found, in, zircon, in, norway, through, x, ray, spectroscopy, analysis, the, place, where, the, discovery, took, place, led, to, the, element, being, named, for, the, latin, name, for, copenhagen, hafnia, the, home, town, of, niels, bohr, today, the, faculty, of, science, of, the, university, of, copenhagen, uses, in, its, seal, a, stylized, image, of, the, hafnium, atom, hafnium, was, separated, from, zirconium, through, repeated, recrystallization, of, the, double, ammonium, or, potassium, fluorides, by, valdemar, thal, jantzen, and, von, hevesey, anton, eduard, van, arkel, and, jan, hendrik, de, boer, were, the, first, to, prepare, metallic, hafnium, by, passing, hafnium, tetraiodide, vapor, over, a, heated, tungsten, filament, in, 1924, this, process, for, differential, purification, of, zirconium, and, hafnium, is, still, in, use, today, hafnium, was, one, of, the, last, two, stable, elements, to, be, discovered, the, element, rhenium, was, found, in, 1908, by, masataka, ogawa, though, its, atomic, number, was, misidentified, at, the, time, and, it, was, not, generally, recognised, by, the, scientific, community, until, its, rediscovery, by, walter, noddack, ida, noddack, and, otto, berg, in, 1925, this, makes, it, somewhat, difficult, to, say, if, hafnium, or, rhenium, was, discovered, last, in, 1923, six, predicted, elements, were, still, missing, from, the, periodic, table, 43, technetium, 61, promethium, 85, astatine, and, 87, francium, are, radioactive, elements, and, are, only, present, in, trace, amounts, in, the, environment, thus, making, elements, 75, rhenium, and, 72, hafnium, the, last, two, unknown, non, radioactive, elements, most, of, the, hafnium, produced, is, used, in, the, manufacture, of, control, rods, for, nuclear, reactors, several, details, contribute, to, the, fact, that, there, are, only, a, few, technical, uses, for, hafnium, first, the, close, similarity, between, hafnium, and, zirconium, makes, it, possible, to, use, the, more, abundant, zirconium, for, most, applications, second, hafnium, was, first, available, as, pure, metal, after, the, use, in, the, nuclear, industry, for, hafnium, free, zirconium, in, the, late, 1950s, furthermore, the, low, abundance, and, difficult, separation, techniques, necessary, make, it, a, scarce, commodity, when, the, demand, for, hafnium, free, zirconium, dropped, following, the, fukushima, disaster, the, price, of, hafnium, increased, sharply, from, around, 500, 600, kg, in, 2014, to, around, 1000, kg, in, 2015, the, nuclei, of, several, hafnium, isotopes, can, each, absorb, multiple, neutrons, this, makes, hafnium, a, good, material, for, nuclear, reactors, control, rods, its, neutron, capture, cross, section, capture, resonance, integral, i, o, 2000, barns, is, about, 600, times, that, of, zirconium, other, elements, that, are, good, neutron, absorbers, for, control, rods, are, cadmium, and, boron, excellent, mechanical, properties, and, exceptional, corrosion, resistance, properties, allow, its, use, in, the, harsh, environment, of, pressurized, water, reactors, the, german, research, reactor, frm, ii, uses, hafnium, as, a, neutron, absorber, it, is, also, common, in, military, reactors, particularly, in, us, naval, submarine, reactors, to, slow, reactor, rates, that, are, too, high, it, is, seldom, found, in, civilian, reactors, the, first, core, of, the, shippingport, atomic, power, station, a, conversion, of, a, naval, reactor, being, a, notable, exception, hafnium, is, used, in, alloys, with, iron, titanium, niobium, tantalum, and, other, metals, an, alloy, used, for, liquid, rocket, thruster, nozzles, for, example, the, main, engine, of, the, apollo, lunar, modules, is, c103, which, consists, of, 89, niobium, 10, hafnium, and, 1, titanium, small, additions, of, hafnium, increase, the, adherence, of, protective, oxide, scales, on, nickel, based, alloys, it, thereby, improves, the, corrosion, resistance, especially, under, cyclic, temperature, conditions, that, tend, to, break, oxide, scales, by, inducing, thermal, stresses, between, the, bulk, material, and, the, oxide, layer, hafnium, based, compounds, are, employed, in, gates, of, transistors, as, insulators, in, the, 45, nm, and, below, generation, of, integrated, circuits, from, intel, ibm, and, others, hafnium, oxide, based, compounds, are, practical, high, k, dielectrics, allowing, reduction, of, the, gate, leakage, current, which, improves, performance, at, such, scales, isotopes, of, hafnium, and, lutetium, along, with, ytterbium, are, also, used, in, isotope, geochemistry, and, geochronological, applications, in, lutetium, hafnium, dating, it, is, often, used, as, a, tracer, of, isotopic, evolution, of, earth, s, mantle, through, time, this, is, because, 176, lu, decays, to, 176, hf, with, a, half, life, of, approximately, 37, billion, years, in, most, geologic, materials, zircon, is, the, dominant, host, of, hafnium, 10, 000, ppm, and, is, often, the, focus, of, hafnium, studies, in, geology, hafnium, is, readily, substituted, into, the, zircon, crystal, lattice, and, is, therefore, very, resistant, to, hafnium, mobility, and, contamination, zircon, also, has, an, extremely, low, lu, hf, ratio, making, any, correction, for, initial, lutetium, minimal, although, the, lu, hf, system, can, be, used, to, calculate, a, model, age, i, e, the, time, at, which, it, was, derived, from, a, given, isotopic, reservoir, such, as, the, depleted, mantle, these, ages, do, not, carry, the, same, geologic, significance, as, do, other, geochronological, techniques, as, the, results, often, yield, isotopic, mixtures, and, thus, provide, an, average, age, of, the, material, from, which, it, was, derived, garnet, is, another, mineral, that, contains, appreciable, amounts, of, hafnium, to, act, as, a, geochronometer, the, high, and, variable, lu, hf, ratios, found, in, garnet, make, it, useful, for, dating, metamorphic, events, due, to, its, heat, resistance, and, its, affinity, to, oxygen, and, nitrogen, hafnium, is, a, good, scavenger, for, oxygen, and, nitrogen, in, gas, filled, and, incandescent, lamps, hafnium, is, also, used, as, the, electrode, in, plasma, cutting, because, of, its, ability, to, shed, electrons, into, the, air, the, high, energy, content, of, 178m2, hf, was, the, concern, of, a, darpa, funded, program, in, the, us, this, program, eventually, concluded, that, using, the, above, mentioned, 178m2, hf, nuclear, isomer, of, hafnium, to, construct, high, yield, weapons, with, x, ray, triggering, mechanisms, an, application, of, induced, gamma, emission, was, infeasible, because, of, its, expense, see, hafnium, controversy, hafnium, metallocene, compounds, can, be, prepared, from, hafnium, tetrachloride, and, various, cyclopentadiene, type, ligand, species, perhaps, the, simplest, hafnium, metallocene, is, hafnocene, dichloride, hafnium, metallocenes, are, part, of, a, large, collection, of, group, 4, transition, metal, metallocene, catalysts, that, are, used, worldwide, in, the, production, of, polyolefin, resins, like, polyethylene, and, polypropylene, a, pyridyl, amidohafnium, catalyst, can, be, used, for, the, controlled, iso, selective, polymerization, of, propylene, which, can, then, be, combined, with, polyethylene, to, make, a, much, tougher, recycled, plastic, hafnium, diselenide, is, studied, in, spintronics, thanks, to, its, charge, density, wave, and, superconductivity, care, needs, to, be, taken, when, machining, hafnium, because, it, is, pyrophoric, fine, particles, can, spontaneously, combust, when, exposed, to, air, compounds, that, contain, this, metal, are, rarely, encountered, by, most, people, the, pure, metal, is, not, considered, toxic, but, hafnium, compounds, should, be, handled, as, if, they, were, toxic, because, the, ionic, forms, of, metals, are, normally, at, greatest, risk, for, toxicity, and, limited, animal, testing, has, been, done, for, hafnium, compounds, people, can, be, exposed, to, hafnium, in, the, workplace, by, breathing, swallowing, skin, and, eye, contact, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, has, set, the, legal, limit, permissible, exposure, limit, for, exposure, to, hafnium, and, hafnium, compounds, in, the, workplace, as, twa, 0, 5, mg, m, 3, over, an, 8, hour, workday, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, has, set, the, same, recommended, exposure, limit, rel, at, levels, of, 50, mg, m, 3, hafnium, is, immediately, dangerous, to, life, and, health
