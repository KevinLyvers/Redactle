a, canyon, from, spanish, ca, n, archaic, british, english, spelling, ca, on, gorge, or, chasm, is, a, deep, cleft, between, escarpments, or, cliffs, resulting, from, weathering, and, the, erosive, activity, of, a, river, over, geologic, time, scales, rivers, have, a, natural, tendency, to, cut, through, underlying, surfaces, eventually, wearing, away, rock, layers, as, sediments, are, removed, downstream, a, river, bed, will, gradually, reach, a, baseline, elevation, which, is, the, same, elevation, as, the, body, of, water, into, which, the, river, drains, the, processes, of, weathering, and, erosion, will, form, canyons, when, the, river, s, headwaters, and, estuary, are, at, significantly, different, elevations, particularly, through, regions, where, softer, rock, layers, are, intermingled, with, harder, layers, more, resistant, to, weathering, a, canyon, may, also, refer, to, a, rift, between, two, mountain, peaks, such, as, those, in, ranges, including, the, rocky, mountains, the, alps, the, himalayas, or, the, andes, usually, a, river, or, stream, carves, out, such, splits, between, mountains, examples, of, mountain, type, canyons, are, provo, canyon, in, utah, or, yosemite, valley, in, california, s, sierra, nevada, canyons, within, mountains, or, gorges, that, have, an, opening, on, only, one, side, are, called, box, canyons, slot, canyons, are, very, narrow, canyons, that, often, have, smooth, walls, steep, sided, valleys, in, the, seabed, of, the, continental, slope, are, referred, to, as, submarine, canyons, unlike, canyons, on, land, submarine, canyons, are, thought, to, be, formed, by, turbidity, currents, and, landslides, the, word, canyon, is, spanish, in, origin, ca, n, pronounced, with, the, same, meaning, the, word, canyon, is, generally, used, in, north, america, while, the, words, gorge, and, ravine, french, in, origin, are, used, in, europe, and, oceania, though, gorge, and, ravine, are, also, used, in, some, parts, of, north, america, in, the, united, states, place, names, generally, use, canyon, in, the, southwest, due, to, their, proximity, to, spanish, speaking, mexico, and, gorge, in, the, northeast, which, is, closer, to, french, canada, with, the, rest, of, the, country, graduating, between, these, two, according, to, geography, in, canada, a, gorge, is, usually, narrow, while, a, ravine, is, more, open, and, often, wooded, the, military, derived, word, defile, is, occasionally, used, in, the, united, kingdom, in, south, africa, kloof, in, krantzkloof, nature, reserve, is, used, along, with, canyon, as, in, blyde, river, canyon, and, gorge, in, oribi, gorge, most, canyons, were, formed, by, a, process, of, long, time, erosion, from, a, plateau, or, table, land, level, the, cliffs, form, because, harder, rock, strata, that, are, resistant, to, erosion, and, weathering, remain, exposed, on, the, valley, walls, canyons, are, much, more, common, in, arid, areas, than, in, wet, areas, because, physical, weathering, has, a, more, localized, effect, in, arid, zones, the, wind, and, water, from, the, river, combine, to, erode, and, cut, away, less, resistant, materials, such, as, shales, the, freezing, and, expansion, of, water, also, serves, to, help, form, canyons, water, seeps, into, cracks, between, the, rocks, and, freezes, pushing, the, rocks, apart, and, eventually, causing, large, chunks, to, break, off, the, canyon, walls, in, a, process, known, as, frost, wedging, canyon, walls, are, often, formed, of, resistant, sandstones, or, granite, sometimes, large, rivers, run, through, canyons, as, the, result, of, gradual, geological, uplift, these, are, called, entrenched, rivers, because, they, are, unable, to, easily, alter, their, course, in, the, united, states, the, colorado, river, in, the, southwest, and, the, snake, river, in, the, northwest, are, two, examples, of, tectonic, uplift, canyons, often, form, in, areas, of, limestone, rock, as, limestone, is, soluble, to, a, certain, extent, cave, systems, form, in, the, rock, when, a, cave, system, collapses, a, canyon, is, left, as, in, the, mendip, hills, in, somerset, and, yorkshire, dales, in, yorkshire, england, a, box, canyon, is, a, small, canyon, that, is, generally, shorter, and, narrower, than, a, river, canyon, with, steep, walls, on, three, sides, allowing, access, and, egress, only, through, the, mouth, of, the, canyon, box, canyons, were, frequently, used, in, the, western, united, states, as, convenient, corrals, with, their, entrances, fenced, the, definition, of, largest, canyon, is, imprecise, because, a, canyon, can, be, large, by, its, depth, its, length, or, the, total, area, of, the, canyon, system, also, the, inaccessibility, of, the, major, canyons, in, the, himalaya, contributes, to, their, not, being, regarded, as, candidates, for, the, biggest, canyon, the, definition, of, deepest, canyon, is, similarly, imprecise, especially, if, one, includes, mountain, canyons, as, well, as, canyons, cut, through, relatively, flat, plateaus, which, have, a, somewhat, well, defined, rim, elevation, the, yarlung, tsangpo, grand, canyon, or, tsangpo, canyon, along, the, yarlung, tsangpo, river, in, tibet, is, regarded, by, some, as, the, deepest, canyon, in, the, world, at, 5, 500, metres, 18, 000, ft, it, is, slightly, longer, than, the, grand, canyon, in, the, united, states, others, consider, the, kali, gandaki, gorge, in, midwest, nepal, to, be, the, deepest, canyon, with, a, 6, 400, metre, 21, 000, ft, difference, between, the, level, of, the, river, and, the, peaks, surrounding, it, vying, for, the, deepest, canyon, in, the, americas, is, the, cotahuasi, canyon, and, colca, canyon, in, southern, peru, both, have, been, measured, at, over, 3, 500, metres, 11, 500, ft, deep, the, grand, canyon, of, northern, arizona, in, the, united, states, with, an, average, depth, of, 1, 600, metres, 5, 200, ft, and, a, volume, of, 4, 17, trillion, cubic, metres, 147, trillion, cubic, feet, is, one, of, the, world, s, largest, canyons, it, was, among, the, 28, finalists, of, the, new, 7, wonders, of, nature, worldwide, poll, some, referred, to, it, as, one, of, the, seven, natural, wonders, of, the, world, the, largest, canyon, in, europe, is, tara, river, canyon, the, largest, canyon, in, africa, is, the, fish, river, canyon, in, namibia, in, august, 2013, the, discovery, of, greenland, s, grand, canyon, was, reported, based, on, the, analysis, of, data, from, operation, icebridge, it, is, located, under, an, ice, sheet, at, 750, kilometres, 470, mi, long, it, is, believed, to, be, the, longest, canyon, in, the, world, despite, not, being, quite, as, deep, or, long, as, the, grand, canyon, the, capertee, valley, in, australia, is, actually, 1, km, wider, than, the, grand, canyon, making, it, the, widest, canyon, in, the, world, some, canyons, have, notable, cultural, significance, evidence, of, archaic, humans, has, been, discovered, in, africa, s, olduvai, gorge, in, the, southwestern, united, states, canyons, are, important, archeologically, because, of, the, many, cliff, dwellings, built, in, such, areas, largely, by, the, ancient, pueblo, people, who, were, their, first, inhabitants, the, following, list, contains, only, the, most, notable, canyons, of, the, world, grouped, by, region, venus, has, many, craters, and, canyons, on, its, surface, the, troughs, on, the, planet, are, part, of, a, system, of, canyons, that, is, more, than, 6, 400, km, long, environment, portal
