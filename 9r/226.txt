in, physical, cosmology, and, astronomy, dark, energy, is, a, proposed, form, of, energy, that, affects, the, universe, on, the, largest, scales, its, primary, effect, is, to, drive, the, accelerating, expansion, of, the, universe, assuming, that, the, lambda, cdm, model, of, cosmology, is, correct, dark, energy, dominates, the, universe, contributing, 68, of, the, total, energy, in, the, present, day, observable, universe, while, dark, matter, and, ordinary, baryonic, matter, contribute, 26, and, 5, respectively, and, other, components, such, as, neutrinos, and, photons, are, nearly, negligible, dark, energy, s, density, is, very, low, 7, 10, 30, g, cm, 3, 6, 10, 10, j, m, 3, in, mass, energy, much, less, than, the, density, of, ordinary, matter, or, dark, matter, within, galaxies, however, it, dominates, the, universe, s, mass, energy, content, because, it, is, uniform, across, space, the, first, observational, evidence, for, dark, energy, s, existence, came, from, measurements, of, supernovae, type, ia, supernovae, have, constant, luminosity, which, means, that, they, can, be, used, as, accurate, distance, measures, comparing, this, distance, to, the, redshift, which, measures, the, speed, at, which, the, supernova, is, receding, shows, that, the, universe, s, expansion, is, accelerating, prior, to, this, observation, scientists, thought, that, the, gravitational, attraction, of, matter, and, energy, in, the, universe, would, cause, the, universe, s, expansion, to, slow, over, time, since, the, discovery, of, accelerating, expansion, several, independent, lines, of, evidence, have, been, discovered, that, support, the, existence, of, dark, energy, the, exact, nature, of, dark, energy, remains, a, mystery, and, possible, explanations, abound, the, main, candidates, are, a, cosmological, constant, representing, a, constant, energy, density, filling, space, homogeneously, and, scalar, fields, dynamic, quantities, having, energy, densities, that, vary, in, time, and, space, such, as, quintessence, or, moduli, a, cosmological, constant, would, remain, constant, across, time, and, space, while, scalar, fields, can, vary, yet, other, possibilities, are, interacting, dark, energy, an, observational, effect, and, cosmological, coupling, see, the, section, dark, energy, theories, of, dark, energy, the, cosmological, constant, is, a, constant, term, that, can, be, added, to, einstein, field, equations, of, general, relativity, if, considered, as, a, source, term, in, the, field, equation, it, can, be, viewed, as, equivalent, to, the, mass, of, empty, space, which, conceptually, could, be, either, positive, or, negative, or, vacuum, energy, the, cosmological, constant, was, first, proposed, by, einstein, as, a, mechanism, to, obtain, a, solution, to, the, gravitational, field, equation, that, would, lead, to, a, static, universe, effectively, using, dark, energy, to, balance, gravity, einstein, gave, the, cosmological, constant, the, symbol, capital, lambda, einstein, stated, that, the, cosmological, constant, required, that, empty, space, takes, the, role, of, gravitating, negative, masses, which, are, distributed, all, over, the, interstellar, space, the, mechanism, was, an, example, of, fine, tuning, and, it, was, later, realized, that, einstein, s, static, universe, would, not, be, stable, local, inhomogeneities, would, ultimately, lead, to, either, the, runaway, expansion, or, contraction, of, the, universe, the, equilibrium, is, unstable, if, the, universe, expands, slightly, then, the, expansion, releases, vacuum, energy, which, causes, yet, more, expansion, likewise, a, universe, which, contracts, slightly, will, continue, contracting, according, to, einstein, empty, space, can, possess, its, own, energy, because, this, energy, is, a, property, of, space, itself, it, would, not, be, diluted, as, space, expands, as, more, space, comes, into, existence, more, of, this, energy, of, space, would, appear, thereby, causing, accelerated, expansion, these, sorts, of, disturbances, are, inevitable, due, to, the, uneven, distribution, of, matter, throughout, the, universe, further, observations, made, by, edwin, hubble, in, 1929, showed, that, the, universe, appears, to, be, expanding, and, is, not, static, einstein, reportedly, referred, to, his, failure, to, predict, the, idea, of, a, dynamic, universe, in, contrast, to, a, static, universe, as, his, greatest, blunder, alan, guth, and, alexei, starobinsky, proposed, in, 1980, that, a, negative, pressure, field, similar, in, concept, to, dark, energy, could, drive, cosmic, inflation, in, the, very, early, universe, inflation, postulates, that, some, repulsive, force, qualitatively, similar, to, dark, energy, resulted, in, an, enormous, and, exponential, expansion, of, the, universe, slightly, after, the, big, bang, such, expansion, is, an, essential, feature, of, most, current, models, of, the, big, bang, however, inflation, must, have, occurred, at, a, much, higher, negative, energy, density, than, the, dark, energy, we, observe, today, and, inflation, is, thought, to, have, completely, ended, when, the, universe, was, just, a, fraction, of, a, second, old, it, is, unclear, what, relation, if, any, exists, between, dark, energy, and, inflation, even, after, inflationary, models, became, accepted, the, cosmological, constant, was, thought, to, be, irrelevant, to, the, current, universe, nearly, all, inflation, models, predict, that, the, total, matter, energy, density, of, the, universe, should, be, very, close, to, the, critical, density, during, the, 1980s, most, cosmological, research, focused, on, models, with, critical, density, in, matter, only, usually, 95, cold, dark, matter, cdm, and, 5, ordinary, matter, baryons, these, models, were, found, to, be, successful, at, forming, realistic, galaxies, and, clusters, but, some, problems, appeared, in, the, late, 1980s, in, particular, the, model, required, a, value, for, the, hubble, constant, lower, than, preferred, by, observations, and, the, model, under, predicted, observations, of, large, scale, galaxy, clustering, these, difficulties, became, stronger, after, the, discovery, of, anisotropy, in, the, cosmic, microwave, background, by, the, cobe, spacecraft, in, 1992, and, several, modified, cdm, models, came, under, active, study, through, the, mid, 1990s, these, included, the, lambda, cdm, model, and, a, mixed, cold, hot, dark, matter, model, the, first, direct, evidence, for, dark, energy, came, from, supernova, observations, in, 1998, of, accelerated, expansion, in, riess, et, al, and, in, perlmutter, et, al, and, the, lambda, cdm, model, then, became, the, leading, model, soon, after, dark, energy, was, supported, by, independent, observations, in, 2000, the, boomerang, and, maxima, cosmic, microwave, background, experiments, observed, the, first, acoustic, peak, in, the, cosmic, microwave, background, showing, that, the, total, matter, energy, density, is, close, to, 100, of, critical, density, then, in, 2001, the, 2df, galaxy, redshift, survey, gave, strong, evidence, that, the, matter, density, is, around, 30, of, critical, the, large, difference, between, these, two, supports, a, smooth, component, of, dark, energy, making, up, the, difference, much, more, precise, measurements, from, wmap, in, 2003, 2010, have, continued, to, support, the, standard, model, and, give, more, accurate, measurements, of, the, key, parameters, the, term, dark, energy, echoing, fritz, zwicky, s, dark, matter, from, the, 1930s, was, coined, by, michael, s, turner, in, 1998, high, precision, measurements, of, the, expansion, of, the, universe, are, required, to, understand, how, the, expansion, rate, changes, over, time, and, space, in, general, relativity, the, evolution, of, the, expansion, rate, is, estimated, from, the, curvature, of, the, universe, and, the, cosmological, equation, of, state, the, relationship, between, temperature, pressure, and, combined, matter, energy, and, vacuum, energy, density, for, any, region, of, space, measuring, the, equation, of, state, for, dark, energy, is, one, of, the, biggest, efforts, in, observational, cosmology, today, adding, the, cosmological, constant, to, cosmology, s, standard, flrw, metric, leads, to, the, lambda, cdm, model, which, has, been, referred, to, as, the, standard, model, of, cosmology, because, of, its, precise, agreement, with, observations, as, of, 2013, the, lambda, cdm, model, is, consistent, with, a, series, of, increasingly, rigorous, cosmological, observations, including, the, planck, spacecraft, and, the, supernova, legacy, survey, first, results, from, the, snls, reveal, that, the, average, behavior, i, e, equation, of, state, of, dark, energy, behaves, like, einstein, s, cosmological, constant, to, a, precision, of, 10, recent, results, from, the, hubble, space, telescope, higher, z, team, indicate, that, dark, energy, has, been, present, for, at, least, 9, billion, years, and, during, the, period, preceding, cosmic, acceleration, the, nature, of, dark, energy, is, more, hypothetical, than, that, of, dark, matter, and, many, things, about, it, remain, in, the, realm, of, speculation, dark, energy, is, thought, to, be, very, homogeneous, and, not, dense, and, is, not, known, to, interact, through, any, of, the, fundamental, forces, other, than, gravity, since, it, is, rarefied, and, un, massive, roughly, 10, 27, kg, m, 3, it, is, unlikely, to, be, detectable, in, laboratory, experiments, the, reason, dark, energy, can, have, such, a, profound, effect, on, the, universe, making, up, 68, of, universal, density, in, spite, of, being, so, dilute, is, that, it, is, believed, to, uniformly, fill, otherwise, empty, space, the, vacuum, energy, that, is, the, particle, antiparticle, pairs, generated, and, mutually, annihilated, within, a, time, frame, in, accord, with, heisenberg, s, uncertainty, principle, in, the, energy, time, formulation, has, been, often, invoked, as, the, main, contribution, to, dark, energy, the, mass, energy, equivalence, postulated, by, general, relativity, implies, that, the, vacuum, energy, should, exert, a, gravitational, force, hence, the, vacuum, energy, is, expected, to, contribute, to, the, cosmological, constant, which, in, turn, impinges, on, the, accelerated, expansion, of, the, universe, however, the, cosmological, constant, problem, asserts, that, there, is, a, huge, disagreement, between, the, observed, values, of, vacuum, energy, density, and, the, theoretical, large, value, of, zero, point, energy, obtained, by, quantum, field, theory, the, problem, remains, unresolved, independently, of, its, actual, nature, dark, energy, would, need, to, have, a, strong, negative, pressure, to, explain, the, observed, acceleration, of, the, expansion, of, the, universe, according, to, general, relativity, the, pressure, within, a, substance, contributes, to, its, gravitational, attraction, for, other, objects, just, as, its, mass, density, does, this, happens, because, the, physical, quantity, that, causes, matter, to, generate, gravitational, effects, is, the, stress, energy, tensor, which, contains, both, the, energy, or, matter, density, of, a, substance, and, its, pressure, in, the, friedmann, lema, tre, robertson, walker, metric, it, can, be, shown, that, a, strong, constant, negative, pressure, i, e, tension, in, all, the, universe, causes, an, acceleration, in, the, expansion, if, the, universe, is, already, expanding, or, a, deceleration, in, contraction, if, the, universe, is, already, contracting, this, accelerating, expansion, effect, is, sometimes, labeled, gravitational, repulsion, in, standard, cosmology, there, are, three, components, of, the, universe, matter, radiation, and, dark, energy, this, matter, is, anything, whose, energy, density, scales, with, the, inverse, cube, of, the, scale, factor, i, e, a, 3, while, radiation, is, anything, whose, energy, density, scales, to, the, inverse, fourth, power, of, the, scale, factor, a, 4, this, can, be, understood, intuitively, for, an, ordinary, particle, in, a, cube, shaped, box, doubling, the, length, of, an, edge, of, the, box, decreases, the, density, and, hence, energy, density, by, a, factor, of, eight, 2, 3, for, radiation, the, decrease, in, energy, density, is, greater, because, an, increase, in, spatial, distance, also, causes, a, redshift, the, final, component, is, dark, energy, it, is, an, intrinsic, property, of, space, and, has, a, constant, energy, density, regardless, of, the, dimensions, of, the, volume, under, consideration, a, 0, thus, unlike, ordinary, matter, it, is, not, diluted, by, the, expansion, of, space, the, evidence, for, dark, energy, is, indirect, but, comes, from, three, independent, sources, in, 1998, the, high, z, supernova, search, team, published, observations, of, type, ia, one, a, supernovae, in, 1999, the, supernova, cosmology, project, followed, by, suggesting, that, the, expansion, of, the, universe, is, accelerating, the, 2011, nobel, prize, in, physics, was, awarded, to, saul, perlmutter, brian, p, schmidt, and, adam, g, riess, for, their, leadership, in, the, discovery, since, then, these, observations, have, been, corroborated, by, several, independent, sources, measurements, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, gravitational, lensing, and, the, large, scale, structure, of, the, cosmos, as, well, as, improved, measurements, of, supernovae, have, been, consistent, with, the, lambda, cdm, model, some, people, argue, that, the, only, indications, for, the, existence, of, dark, energy, are, observations, of, distance, measurements, and, their, associated, redshifts, cosmic, microwave, background, anisotropies, and, baryon, acoustic, oscillations, serve, only, to, demonstrate, that, distances, to, a, given, redshift, are, larger, than, would, be, expected, from, a, dusty, friedmann, lema, tre, universe, and, the, local, measured, hubble, constant, supernovae, are, useful, for, cosmology, because, they, are, excellent, standard, candles, across, cosmological, distances, they, allow, researchers, to, measure, the, expansion, history, of, the, universe, by, looking, at, the, relationship, between, the, distance, to, an, object, and, its, redshift, which, gives, how, fast, it, is, receding, from, us, the, relationship, is, roughly, linear, according, to, hubble, s, law, it, is, relatively, easy, to, measure, redshift, but, finding, the, distance, to, an, object, is, more, difficult, usually, astronomers, use, standard, candles, objects, for, which, the, intrinsic, brightness, or, absolute, magnitude, is, known, this, allows, the, object, s, distance, to, be, measured, from, its, actual, observed, brightness, or, apparent, magnitude, type, ia, supernovae, are, the, best, known, standard, candles, across, cosmological, distances, because, of, their, extreme, and, consistent, luminosity, recent, observations, of, supernovae, are, consistent, with, a, universe, made, up, 71, 3, of, dark, energy, and, 27, 4, of, a, combination, of, dark, matter, and, baryonic, matter, the, theory, of, large, scale, structure, which, governs, the, formation, of, structures, in, the, universe, stars, quasars, galaxies, and, galaxy, groups, and, clusters, also, suggests, that, the, density, of, matter, in, the, universe, is, only, 30, of, the, critical, density, a, 2011, survey, the, wigglez, galaxy, survey, of, more, than, 200, 000, galaxies, provided, further, evidence, towards, the, existence, of, dark, energy, although, the, exact, physics, behind, it, remains, unknown, the, wigglez, survey, from, the, australian, astronomical, observatory, scanned, the, galaxies, to, determine, their, redshift, then, by, exploiting, the, fact, that, baryon, acoustic, oscillations, have, left, voids, regularly, of, 150, mpc, diameter, surrounded, by, the, galaxies, the, voids, were, used, as, standard, rulers, to, estimate, distances, to, galaxies, as, far, as, 2, 000, mpc, redshift, 0, 6, allowing, for, accurate, estimate, of, the, speeds, of, galaxies, from, their, redshift, and, distance, the, data, confirmed, cosmic, acceleration, up, to, half, of, the, age, of, the, universe, 7, billion, years, and, constrain, its, inhomogeneity, to, 1, part, in, 10, this, provides, a, confirmation, to, cosmic, acceleration, independent, of, supernovae, the, existence, of, dark, energy, in, whatever, form, is, needed, to, reconcile, the, measured, geometry, of, space, with, the, total, amount, of, matter, in, the, universe, measurements, of, cosmic, microwave, background, anisotropies, indicate, that, the, universe, is, close, to, flat, for, the, shape, of, the, universe, to, be, flat, the, mass, energy, density, of, the, universe, must, be, equal, to, the, critical, density, the, total, amount, of, matter, in, the, universe, including, baryons, and, dark, matter, as, measured, from, the, cosmic, microwave, background, spectrum, accounts, for, only, about, 30, of, the, critical, density, this, implies, the, existence, of, an, additional, form, of, energy, to, account, for, the, remaining, 70, the, wilkinson, microwave, anisotropy, probe, wmap, spacecraft, seven, year, analysis, estimated, a, universe, made, up, of, 72, 8, dark, energy, 22, 7, dark, matter, and, 4, 5, ordinary, matter, work, done, in, 2013, based, on, the, planck, spacecraft, observations, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, gave, a, more, accurate, estimate, of, 68, 3, dark, energy, 26, 8, dark, matter, and, 4, 9, ordinary, matter, accelerated, cosmic, expansion, causes, gravitational, potential, wells, and, hills, to, flatten, as, photons, pass, through, them, producing, cold, spots, and, hot, spots, on, the, cosmic, microwave, background, aligned, with, vast, supervoids, and, superclusters, this, so, called, late, time, integrated, sachs, wolfe, effect, isw, is, a, direct, signal, of, dark, energy, in, a, flat, universe, it, was, reported, at, high, significance, in, 2008, by, ho, et, al, and, giannantonio, et, al, a, new, approach, to, test, evidence, of, dark, energy, through, observational, hubble, constant, data, ohd, also, known, as, cosmic, chronometers, has, gained, significant, attention, in, recent, years, the, hubble, constant, h, z, is, measured, as, a, function, of, cosmological, redshift, ohd, directly, tracks, the, expansion, history, of, the, universe, by, taking, passively, evolving, early, type, galaxies, as, cosmic, chronometers, from, this, point, this, approach, provides, standard, clocks, in, the, universe, the, core, of, this, idea, is, the, measurement, of, the, differential, age, evolution, as, a, function, of, redshift, of, these, cosmic, chronometers, thus, it, provides, a, direct, estimate, of, the, hubble, parameter, the, reliance, on, a, differential, quantity, z, t, brings, more, information, and, is, appealing, for, computation, it, can, minimize, many, common, issues, and, systematic, effects, analyses, of, supernovae, and, baryon, acoustic, oscillations, bao, are, based, on, integrals, of, the, hubble, parameter, whereas, z, t, measures, it, directly, for, these, reasons, this, method, has, been, widely, used, to, examine, the, accelerated, cosmic, expansion, and, study, properties, of, dark, energy, dark, energy, s, status, as, a, hypothetical, force, with, unknown, properties, makes, it, an, active, target, of, research, the, problem, is, attacked, from, a, variety, of, angles, such, as, modifying, the, prevailing, theory, of, gravity, general, relativity, attempting, to, pin, down, the, properties, of, dark, energy, and, finding, alternative, ways, to, explain, the, observational, data, the, simplest, explanation, for, dark, energy, is, that, it, is, an, intrinsic, fundamental, energy, of, space, this, is, the, cosmological, constant, usually, represented, by, the, greek, letter, lambda, hence, the, name, lambda, cdm, model, since, energy, and, mass, are, related, according, to, the, equation, e, mc, 2, einstein, s, theory, of, general, relativity, predicts, that, this, energy, will, have, a, gravitational, effect, it, is, sometimes, called, vacuum, energy, because, it, is, the, energy, density, of, empty, space, of, vacuum, a, major, outstanding, problem, is, that, the, same, quantum, field, theories, predict, a, huge, cosmological, constant, about, 120, orders, of, magnitude, too, large, this, would, need, to, be, almost, but, not, exactly, cancelled, by, an, equally, large, term, of, the, opposite, sign, some, supersymmetric, theories, require, a, cosmological, constant, that, is, exactly, zero, also, it, is, unknown, whether, there, is, a, metastable, vacuum, state, in, string, theory, with, a, positive, cosmological, constant, and, it, has, been, conjectured, by, ulf, danielsson, et, al, that, no, such, state, exists, this, conjecture, would, not, rule, out, other, models, of, dark, energy, such, as, quintessence, that, could, be, compatible, with, string, theory, in, quintessence, models, of, dark, energy, the, observed, acceleration, of, the, scale, factor, is, caused, by, the, potential, energy, of, a, dynamical, field, referred, to, as, quintessence, field, quintessence, differs, from, the, cosmological, constant, in, that, it, can, vary, in, space, and, time, in, order, for, it, not, to, clump, and, form, structure, like, matter, the, field, must, be, very, light, so, that, it, has, a, large, compton, wavelength, in, the, simplest, scenarios, the, quintessence, field, has, a, canonical, kinetic, term, is, minimally, coupled, to, gravity, and, does, not, feature, higher, order, operations, in, its, lagrangian, no, evidence, of, quintessence, is, yet, available, nor, has, it, been, ruled, out, it, generally, predicts, a, slightly, slower, acceleration, of, the, expansion, of, the, universe, than, the, cosmological, constant, some, scientists, think, that, the, best, evidence, for, quintessence, would, come, from, violations, of, einstein, s, equivalence, principle, and, variation, of, the, fundamental, constants, in, space, or, time, scalar, fields, are, predicted, by, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, and, string, theory, but, an, analogous, problem, to, the, cosmological, constant, problem, or, the, problem, of, constructing, models, of, cosmological, inflation, occurs, renormalization, theory, predicts, that, scalar, fields, should, acquire, large, masses, the, coincidence, problem, asks, why, the, acceleration, of, the, universe, began, when, it, did, if, acceleration, began, earlier, in, the, universe, structures, such, as, galaxies, would, never, have, had, time, to, form, and, life, at, least, as, we, know, it, would, never, have, had, a, chance, to, exist, proponents, of, the, anthropic, principle, view, this, as, support, for, their, arguments, however, many, models, of, quintessence, have, a, so, called, tracker, behavior, which, solves, this, problem, in, these, models, the, quintessence, field, has, a, density, which, closely, tracks, but, is, less, than, the, radiation, density, until, matter, radiation, equality, which, triggers, quintessence, to, start, behaving, as, dark, energy, eventually, dominating, the, universe, this, naturally, sets, the, low, energy, scale, of, the, dark, energy, in, 2004, when, scientists, fit, the, evolution, of, dark, energy, with, the, cosmological, data, they, found, that, the, equation, of, state, had, possibly, crossed, the, cosmological, constant, boundary, w, 1, from, above, to, below, a, no, go, theorem, has, been, proved, that, this, scenario, requires, models, with, at, least, two, types, of, quintessence, this, scenario, is, the, so, called, quintom, scenario, some, special, cases, of, quintessence, are, phantom, energy, in, which, the, energy, density, of, quintessence, actually, increases, with, time, and, k, essence, short, for, kinetic, quintessence, which, has, a, non, standard, form, of, kinetic, energy, such, as, a, negative, kinetic, energy, they, can, have, unusual, properties, phantom, energy, for, example, can, cause, a, big, rip, a, group, of, researchers, argued, in, 2021, that, observations, of, the, hubble, tension, may, imply, that, only, quintessence, models, with, a, nonzero, coupling, constant, are, viable, this, class, of, theories, attempts, to, come, up, with, an, all, encompassing, theory, of, both, dark, matter, and, dark, energy, as, a, single, phenomenon, that, modifies, the, laws, of, gravity, at, various, scales, this, could, for, example, treat, dark, energy, and, dark, matter, as, different, facets, of, the, same, unknown, substance, or, postulate, that, cold, dark, matter, decays, into, dark, energy, another, class, of, theories, that, unifies, dark, matter, and, dark, energy, are, suggested, to, be, covariant, theories, of, modified, gravities, these, theories, alter, the, dynamics, of, spacetime, such, that, the, modified, dynamics, stems, to, what, have, been, assigned, to, the, presence, of, dark, energy, and, dark, matter, dark, energy, could, in, principle, interact, not, only, with, the, rest, of, the, dark, sector, but, also, with, ordinary, matter, however, cosmology, alone, is, not, sufficient, to, effectively, constrain, the, strength, of, the, coupling, between, dark, energy, and, baryons, so, that, other, indirect, techniques, or, laboratory, searches, have, to, be, adopted, it, was, briefly, theorized, in, the, early, 2020s, that, excess, observed, in, the, xenon1t, detector, in, italy, may, have, been, caused, by, a, chameleon, model, of, dark, energy, but, further, experiments, disproved, this, possibility, the, density, of, dark, energy, might, have, varied, in, time, during, the, history, of, the, universe, modern, observational, data, allows, us, to, estimate, the, present, density, of, dark, energy, using, baryon, acoustic, oscillations, it, is, possible, to, investigate, the, effect, of, dark, energy, in, the, history, of, the, universe, and, constrain, parameters, of, the, equation, of, state, of, dark, energy, to, that, end, several, models, have, been, proposed, one, of, the, most, popular, models, is, the, chevallier, polarski, linder, model, cpl, some, other, common, models, are, barboza, alcaniz, 2008, jassal, et, al, 2005, wetterich, 2004, and, oztas, et, al, 2018, researchers, using, the, dark, energy, spectroscopic, instrument, desi, to, make, the, largest, 3, d, map, of, the, universe, as, of, 2024, have, obtained, an, expansion, history, that, has, greater, than, 1, precision, from, this, level, of, detail, desi, director, michael, levi, stated, we, re, also, seeing, some, potentially, interesting, differences, that, could, indicate, that, dark, energy, is, evolving, over, time, those, may, or, may, not, go, away, with, more, data, so, we, re, excited, to, start, analyzing, our, three, year, dataset, soon, some, alternatives, to, dark, energy, such, as, inhomogeneous, cosmology, aim, to, explain, the, observational, data, by, a, more, refined, use, of, established, theories, in, this, scenario, dark, energy, does, not, actually, exist, and, is, merely, a, measurement, artifact, for, example, if, we, are, located, in, an, emptier, than, average, region, of, space, the, observed, cosmic, expansion, rate, could, be, mistaken, for, a, variation, in, time, or, acceleration, a, different, approach, uses, a, cosmological, extension, of, the, equivalence, principle, to, show, how, space, might, appear, to, be, expanding, more, rapidly, in, the, voids, surrounding, our, local, cluster, while, weak, such, effects, considered, cumulatively, over, billions, of, years, could, become, significant, creating, the, illusion, of, cosmic, acceleration, and, making, it, appear, as, if, we, live, in, a, hubble, bubble, yet, other, possibilities, are, that, the, accelerated, expansion, of, the, universe, is, an, illusion, caused, by, the, relative, motion, of, us, to, the, rest, of, the, universe, or, that, the, statistical, methods, employed, were, flawed, a, laboratory, direct, detection, attempt, failed, to, detect, any, force, associated, with, dark, energy, observational, skepticism, explanations, of, dark, energy, have, generally, not, gained, much, traction, among, cosmologists, for, example, a, paper, that, suggested, the, anisotropy, of, the, local, universe, has, been, misrepresented, as, dark, energy, was, quickly, countered, by, another, paper, claiming, errors, in, the, original, paper, another, study, questioning, the, essential, assumption, that, the, luminosity, of, type, ia, supernovae, does, not, vary, with, stellar, population, age, was, also, swiftly, rebutted, by, other, cosmologists, this, theory, was, formulated, by, researchers, of, the, university, of, hawai, i, at, m, noa, in, february, 2023, the, idea, is, that, if, one, requires, the, kerr, metric, which, describes, rotating, black, holes, to, asymptote, to, the, friedmann, robertson, walker, metric, which, describes, the, isotropic, and, homogeneous, universe, that, is, the, basic, assumption, of, modern, cosmology, then, one, finds, that, black, holes, gain, mass, as, the, universe, expands, the, rate, is, measured, to, be, a, 3, where, a, is, the, scale, factor, this, particular, rate, means, that, the, energy, density, of, black, holes, remains, constant, over, time, mimicking, dark, energy, see, dark, energy, technical, definition, the, theory, is, called, cosmological, coupling, because, the, black, holes, couple, to, a, cosmological, requirement, other, astrophysicists, are, skeptical, with, a, variety, of, papers, claiming, that, the, theory, fails, to, explain, other, observations, the, evidence, for, dark, energy, is, heavily, dependent, on, the, theory, of, general, relativity, therefore, it, is, conceivable, that, a, modification, to, general, relativity, also, eliminates, the, need, for, dark, energy, there, are, many, such, theories, and, research, is, ongoing, the, measurement, of, the, speed, of, gravity, in, the, first, gravitational, wave, measured, by, non, gravitational, means, gw170817, ruled, out, many, modified, gravity, theories, as, explanations, to, dark, energy, astrophysicist, ethan, siegel, states, that, while, such, alternatives, gain, mainstream, press, coverage, almost, all, professional, astrophysicists, are, confident, that, dark, energy, exists, and, that, none, of, the, competing, theories, successfully, explain, observations, to, the, same, level, of, precision, as, standard, dark, energy, the, grsi, model, explains, the, accelerating, expansion, of, the, universe, a, suppression, of, gravity, as, large, distance, such, suppression, is, a, consequence, of, an, increased, binding, energy, within, a, galaxy, due, to, general, relativity, s, field, self, interaction, the, increased, binding, requires, by, energy, conservation, a, suppression, of, gravitational, attraction, outside, said, galaxy, the, suppression, is, in, lieu, of, dark, energy, this, is, analogous, to, the, central, phenomenology, of, strong, nuclear, force, where, the, gluons, field, self, interaction, dramatically, strengthens, the, binding, of, quarks, ultimately, leading, to, their, confinement, this, in, turn, suppresses, the, strong, nuclear, force, outside, hadrons, cosmologists, estimate, that, the, acceleration, began, roughly, 5, billion, years, ago, before, that, it, is, thought, that, the, expansion, was, decelerating, due, to, the, attractive, influence, of, matter, the, density, of, dark, matter, in, an, expanding, universe, decreases, more, quickly, than, dark, energy, and, eventually, the, dark, energy, dominates, specifically, when, the, volume, of, the, universe, doubles, the, density, of, dark, matter, is, halved, but, the, density, of, dark, energy, is, nearly, unchanged, it, is, exactly, constant, in, the, case, of, a, cosmological, constant, projections, into, the, future, can, differ, radically, for, different, models, of, dark, energy, for, a, cosmological, constant, or, any, other, model, that, predicts, that, the, acceleration, will, continue, indefinitely, the, ultimate, result, will, be, that, galaxies, outside, the, local, group, will, have, a, line, of, sight, velocity, that, continually, increases, with, time, eventually, far, exceeding, the, speed, of, light, this, is, not, a, violation, of, special, relativity, because, the, notion, of, velocity, used, here, is, different, from, that, of, velocity, in, a, local, inertial, frame, of, reference, which, is, still, constrained, to, be, less, than, the, speed, of, light, for, any, massive, object, see, uses, of, the, proper, distance, for, a, discussion, of, the, subtleties, of, defining, any, notion, of, relative, velocity, in, cosmology, because, the, hubble, parameter, is, decreasing, with, time, there, can, actually, be, cases, where, a, galaxy, that, is, receding, from, us, faster, than, light, does, manage, to, emit, a, signal, which, reaches, us, eventually, however, because, of, the, accelerating, expansion, it, is, projected, that, most, galaxies, will, eventually, cross, a, type, of, cosmological, event, horizon, where, any, light, they, emit, past, that, point, will, never, be, able, to, reach, us, at, any, time, in, the, infinite, future, because, the, light, never, reaches, a, point, where, its, peculiar, velocity, toward, us, exceeds, the, expansion, velocity, away, from, us, these, two, notions, of, velocity, are, also, discussed, in, uses, of, the, proper, distance, assuming, the, dark, energy, is, constant, a, cosmological, constant, the, current, distance, to, this, cosmological, event, horizon, is, about, 16, billion, light, years, meaning, that, a, signal, from, an, event, happening, at, present, would, eventually, be, able, to, reach, us, in, the, future, if, the, event, were, less, than, 16, billion, light, years, away, but, the, signal, would, never, reach, us, if, the, event, were, more, than, 16, billion, light, years, away, as, galaxies, approach, the, point, of, crossing, this, cosmological, event, horizon, the, light, from, them, will, become, more, and, more, redshifted, to, the, point, where, the, wavelength, becomes, too, large, to, detect, in, practice, and, the, galaxies, appear, to, vanish, completely, see, future, of, an, expanding, universe, planet, earth, the, milky, way, and, the, local, group, of, galaxies, of, which, the, milky, way, is, a, part, would, all, remain, virtually, undisturbed, as, the, rest, of, the, universe, recedes, and, disappears, from, view, in, this, scenario, the, local, group, would, ultimately, suffer, heat, death, just, as, was, hypothesized, for, the, flat, matter, dominated, universe, before, measurements, of, cosmic, acceleration, there, are, other, more, speculative, ideas, about, the, future, of, the, universe, the, phantom, energy, model, of, dark, energy, results, in, divergent, expansion, which, would, imply, that, the, effective, force, of, dark, energy, continues, growing, until, it, dominates, all, other, forces, in, the, universe, under, this, scenario, dark, energy, would, ultimately, tear, apart, all, gravitationally, bound, structures, including, galaxies, and, solar, systems, and, eventually, overcome, the, electrical, and, nuclear, forces, to, tear, apart, atoms, themselves, ending, the, universe, in, a, big, rip, on, the, other, hand, dark, energy, might, dissipate, with, time, or, even, become, attractive, such, uncertainties, leave, open, the, possibility, of, gravity, eventually, prevailing, and, lead, to, a, universe, that, contracts, in, on, itself, in, a, big, crunch, or, that, there, may, even, be, a, dark, energy, cycle, which, implies, a, cyclic, model, of, the, universe, in, which, every, iteration, big, bang, then, eventually, a, big, crunch, takes, about, a, trillion, 10, 12, years, while, none, of, these, are, supported, by, observations, they, are, not, ruled, out, the, astrophysicist, david, merritt, identifies, dark, energy, as, an, example, of, an, auxiliary, hypothesis, an, ad, hoc, postulate, that, is, added, to, a, theory, in, response, to, observations, that, falsify, it, he, argues, that, the, dark, energy, hypothesis, is, a, conventionalist, hypothesis, that, is, a, hypothesis, that, adds, no, empirical, content, and, hence, is, unfalsifiable, in, the, sense, defined, by, karl, popper, however, his, opinion, is, not, accepted, by, a, majority, of, physicists, the, universe, has, gone, through, three, distinct, eras, the, evolution, of, the, scale, factor, is, controlled, by, the, dominant, energy, form, for, constant, w, during, the, radiation, dominated, era, during, the, matter, dominated, era, and, for, the, dark, energy, dominated, era, assuming, w, 1, asymptotically, taken, together, all, the, current, data, provide, strong, evidence, for, the, existence, of, dark, energy, they, constrain, the, fraction, of, critical, density, contributed, by, dark, energy, 0, 76, 0, 02, and, the, equation, of, state, parameter, assuming, that, w, is, constant, this, implies, that, the, universe, began, accelerating, at, redshift, z, 0, 4, and, age, t, 10, ga, these, results, are, robust, data, from, any, one, method, can, be, removed, without, compromising, the, constraints, and, they, are, not, substantially, weakened, by, dropping, the, assumption, of, spatial, flatness, 44
