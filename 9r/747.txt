cumulonimbus, from, latin, cumulus, swell, and, nimbus, cloud, is, a, dense, towering, vertical, cloud, typically, forming, from, water, vapor, condensing, in, the, lower, troposphere, that, builds, upward, carried, by, powerful, buoyant, air, currents, above, the, lower, portions, of, the, cumulonimbus, the, water, vapor, becomes, ice, crystals, such, as, snow, and, graupel, the, interaction, of, which, can, lead, to, hail, and, to, lightning, formation, respectively, when, causing, thunderstorms, these, clouds, may, be, called, thunderheads, cumulonimbus, can, form, alone, in, clusters, or, along, squall, lines, these, clouds, are, capable, of, producing, lightning, and, other, dangerous, severe, weather, such, as, tornadoes, hazardous, winds, and, large, hailstones, cumulonimbus, progress, from, overdeveloped, cumulus, congestus, clouds, and, may, further, develop, as, part, of, a, supercell, cumulonimbus, is, abbreviated, as, cb, towering, cumulonimbus, clouds, are, typically, accompanied, by, smaller, cumulus, clouds, the, cumulonimbus, base, may, extend, several, kilometres, miles, across, or, be, as, small, as, several, tens, of, metres, yards, across, and, occupy, low, to, upper, altitudes, within, the, troposphere, formed, at, altitude, from, approximately, 200, to, 4, 000, m, 700, to, 10, 000, ft, normal, peaks, usually, reach, to, as, much, as, 12, 000, m, 39, 000, ft, with, unusually, high, ones, typically, topping, out, around, 20, 000, m, 66, 000, ft, and, extreme, instances, claimed, to, be, as, high, as, 21, 000, m, 69, 000, ft, or, more, well, developed, cumulonimbus, clouds, are, characterized, by, a, flat, anvil, shaped, top, anvil, dome, caused, by, wind, shear, or, inversion, at, the, equilibrium, level, near, the, tropopause, the, shelf, of, the, anvil, may, precede, the, main, cloud, s, vertical, component, for, many, kilometres, miles, and, be, accompanied, by, lightning, occasionally, rising, air, parcels, surpass, the, equilibrium, level, due, to, momentum, and, form, an, overshooting, top, culminating, at, the, maximum, parcel, level, when, vertically, developed, this, largest, of, all, clouds, usually, extends, through, all, three, cloud, regions, even, the, smallest, cumulonimbus, cloud, dwarfs, its, neighbors, in, comparison, cumulonimbus, storm, cells, can, produce, torrential, rain, of, a, convective, nature, often, in, the, form, of, a, rain, shaft, and, flash, flooding, as, well, as, straight, line, winds, most, storm, cells, die, after, about, 20, minutes, when, the, precipitation, causes, more, downdraft, than, updraft, causing, the, energy, to, dissipate, if, there, is, sufficient, instability, and, moisture, in, the, atmosphere, however, on, a, hot, summer, day, for, example, the, outflowing, moisture, and, gusts, from, one, storm, cell, can, lead, to, new, cells, forming, just, a, few, kilometres, miles, from, the, former, one, a, few, tens, of, minutes, later, or, in, some, cases, hundreds, of, kilometres, miles, away, many, hours, later, this, process, cause, thunderstorm, formation, and, decay, to, last, for, several, hours, or, even, over, multiple, days, cumulonimbus, clouds, can, also, occur, as, dangerous, winter, storms, called, thundersnow, which, are, associated, with, particularly, intense, snowfall, rates, and, with, blizzard, conditions, when, accompanied, by, strong, winds, that, further, reduce, visibility, however, cumulonimbus, clouds, are, most, common, in, tropical, regions, and, are, also, frequent, in, moist, environments, during, the, warm, season, in, the, middle, latitudes, a, dust, storm, caused, by, a, cumulonimbus, downburst, is, a, haboob, cumulonimbus, are, a, notable, hazard, to, aviation, due, most, importantly, to, potent, wind, currents, but, also, reduced, visibility, and, lightning, as, well, as, icing, and, hail, if, flying, inside, the, cloud, within, and, in, the, vicinity, of, thunderstorms, there, is, significant, turbulence, and, clear, air, turbulence, particularly, downwind, respectively, wind, shear, within, and, under, a, cumulonimbus, is, often, intense, with, downbursts, being, responsible, for, many, accidents, in, earlier, decades, before, training, and, technological, detection, and, nowcasting, measures, were, implemented, a, small, form, of, downburst, the, microburst, is, the, most, often, implicated, in, crashes, because, of, their, rapid, onset, and, swift, changes, in, wind, and, aerodynamic, conditions, over, short, distances, most, downbursts, are, associated, with, visible, precipitation, shafts, however, dry, microbursts, are, generally, invisible, to, the, naked, eye, at, least, one, fatal, commercial, airline, accident, was, associated, with, flying, through, a, tornado, in, general, cumulonimbus, require, moisture, an, unstable, air, mass, and, a, lifting, force, in, order, to, form, cumulonimbus, typically, go, through, three, stages, the, developing, stage, the, mature, stage, where, the, main, cloud, may, reach, supercell, status, in, favorable, conditions, and, the, dissipation, stage, the, average, thunderstorm, has, a, 24, km, 15, mi, diameter, and, a, height, of, approximately, 12, 2, km, 40, 000, ft, depending, on, the, conditions, present, in, the, atmosphere, these, three, stages, take, an, average, of, 30, minutes, to, go, through, clouds, form, when, the, dew, point, temperature, of, water, is, reached, in, the, presence, of, condensation, nuclei, in, the, troposphere, the, atmosphere, is, a, dynamic, system, and, the, local, conditions, of, turbulence, uplift, and, other, parameters, give, rise, to, many, types, of, clouds, various, types, of, cloud, occur, frequently, enough, to, have, been, categorized, furthermore, some, atmospheric, processes, can, make, the, clouds, organize, in, distinct, patterns, such, as, wave, clouds, or, actinoform, clouds, these, are, large, scale, structures, and, are, not, always, readily, identifiable, from, a, single, point, of, view
