ammonium, nitrate, is, a, chemical, compound, with, the, formula, nh, 4, no, 3, it, is, a, white, crystalline, salt, consisting, of, ions, of, ammonium, and, nitrate, it, is, highly, soluble, in, water, and, hygroscopic, as, a, solid, although, it, does, not, form, hydrates, it, is, predominantly, used, in, agriculture, as, a, high, nitrogen, fertilizer, its, other, major, use, is, as, a, component, of, explosive, mixtures, used, in, mining, quarrying, and, civil, construction, it, is, the, major, constituent, of, anfo, a, popular, industrial, explosive, which, accounts, for, 80, of, explosives, used, in, north, america, similar, formulations, have, been, used, in, improvised, explosive, devices, many, countries, are, phasing, out, its, use, in, consumer, applications, due, to, concerns, over, its, potential, for, misuse, accidental, ammonium, nitrate, explosions, have, killed, thousands, of, people, since, the, early, 20th, century, global, production, was, estimated, at, 21, 6, million, tonnes, in, 2017, by, 2021, global, production, of, ammonium, nitrate, was, down, to, 16, 7, million, tonnes, ammonium, nitrate, is, found, as, the, natural, mineral, gwihabaite, formerly, known, as, nitrammite, the, ammonium, analogue, of, saltpetre, mineralogical, name, niter, in, the, driest, regions, of, the, atacama, desert, in, chile, often, as, a, crust, on, the, ground, or, in, conjunction, with, other, nitrate, iodate, and, halide, minerals, ammonium, nitrate, was, mined, there, until, the, haber, bosch, process, made, it, possible, to, synthesize, nitrates, from, atmospheric, nitrogen, thus, rendering, nitrate, mining, obsolete, the, industrial, production, of, ammonium, nitrate, entails, the, acid, base, reaction, of, ammonia, with, nitric, acid, the, ammonia, required, for, this, process, is, obtained, by, the, haber, process, from, nitrogen, and, hydrogen, ammonia, produced, by, the, haber, process, can, be, oxidized, to, nitric, acid, by, the, ostwald, process, ammonia, is, used, in, its, anhydrous, form, a, gas, and, the, nitric, acid, is, concentrated, the, reaction, is, violent, owing, to, its, highly, exothermic, nature, after, the, solution, is, formed, typically, at, about, 83, concentration, the, excess, water, is, evaporated, off, to, leave, an, ammonium, nitrate, an, content, of, 95, to, 99, 9, concentration, an, melt, depending, on, grade, the, an, melt, is, then, made, into, prills, or, small, beads, in, a, spray, tower, or, into, granules, by, spraying, and, tumbling, in, a, rotating, drum, the, prills, or, granules, may, be, further, dried, cooled, and, then, coated, to, prevent, caking, these, prills, or, granules, are, the, typical, an, products, in, commerce, another, production, method, is, a, variant, of, the, nitrophosphate, process, the, products, calcium, carbonate, and, ammonium, nitrate, may, be, separately, purified, or, sold, combined, as, calcium, ammonium, nitrate, ammonium, nitrate, can, also, be, made, via, metathesis, reactions, as, ammonium, nitrate, is, a, salt, both, the, cation, nh, 4, and, the, anion, no, 3, may, take, part, in, chemical, reactions, solid, ammonium, nitrate, decomposes, on, heating, at, temperatures, below, around, 300, c, the, decomposition, mainly, produces, nitrous, oxide, and, water, at, higher, temperatures, the, following, reaction, predominates, both, decomposition, reactions, are, exothermic, and, their, products, are, gas, under, certain, conditions, this, can, lead, to, a, runaway, reaction, with, the, decomposition, process, becoming, explosive, see, disasters, for, details, many, ammonium, nitrate, disasters, with, loss, of, lives, have, occurred, the, red, orange, colour, in, an, explosion, cloud, is, due, to, nitrogen, dioxide, a, secondary, reaction, product, a, number, of, crystalline, phases, of, ammonium, nitrate, have, been, observed, the, following, occur, under, atmospheric, pressure, the, transition, between, rhombic, to, rhombic, forms, at, 32, 3, c, occurs, at, ambient, temperature, in, many, parts, of, the, world, these, forms, have, a, 3, 6, difference, in, density, and, hence, transition, between, them, causes, a, change, in, volume, one, practical, consequence, of, this, is, that, ammonium, nitrate, cannot, be, used, as, a, solid, rocket, motor, propellant, as, it, develops, cracks, stabilized, ammonium, nitrate, psan, was, developed, as, a, solution, to, this, and, incorporates, metal, halides, stabilisers, which, prevent, density, fluctuations, ammonium, nitrate, is, an, important, fertilizer, with, npk, rating, 34, 0, 0, 34, nitrogen, it, is, less, concentrated, than, urea, 46, 0, 0, giving, ammonium, nitrate, a, slight, transportation, disadvantage, ammonium, nitrate, s, advantage, over, urea, is, that, it, is, more, stable, and, does, not, rapidly, lose, nitrogen, to, the, atmosphere, ammonium, nitrate, readily, forms, explosive, mixtures, with, varying, properties, when, combined, with, explosives, such, as, tnt, or, with, fuels, like, aluminum, powder, or, fuel, oil, examples, of, explosives, containing, ammonium, nitrate, include, anfo, is, a, mixture, of, 94, ammonium, nitrate, an, and, 6, fuel, oil, fo, widely, used, as, a, bulk, industrial, explosive, 1, it, is, used, in, coal, mining, quarrying, metal, mining, and, civil, construction, in, undemanding, applications, where, the, advantages, of, anfo, s, low, cost, relative, safety, and, ease, of, use, matter, more, than, the, benefits, offered, by, conventional, industrial, explosives, such, as, water, resistance, oxygen, balance, high, detonation, velocity, and, performance, in, small, diameters, 2, ammonium, nitrate, based, explosives, were, used, in, the, sterling, hall, bombing, in, madison, wisconsin, 1970, the, oklahoma, city, bombing, in, 1995, the, 2011, delhi, bombings, the, 2011, bombing, in, oslo, the, myyrmanni, bombing, and, the, 2013, hyderabad, blasts, in, november, 2009, the, government, of, the, north, west, frontier, province, nwfp, of, pakistan, imposed, a, ban, on, ammonium, sulfate, ammonium, nitrate, and, calcium, ammonium, nitrate, fertilizers, in, the, former, malakand, division, comprising, the, upper, dir, lower, dir, swat, chitral, and, malakand, districts, of, the, nwfp, following, reports, that, those, chemicals, were, used, by, militants, to, make, explosives, due, to, these, bans, potassium, chlorate, the, material, which, allows, safety, matches, to, catch, fire, has, surpassed, fertilizer, as, the, explosive, of, choice, for, insurgents, ammonium, nitrate, is, used, in, some, instant, cold, packs, as, its, dissolution, in, water, is, highly, endothermic, in, 2021, king, abdullah, university, of, science, and, technology, in, saudi, arabia, conducted, experiments, to, study, the, potential, for, dissolving, ammonium, nitrate, in, water, for, off, grid, cooling, systems, and, as, a, refrigerant, they, suggested, that, the, water, could, be, distilled, and, reused, using, solar, energy, to, avoid, water, wastage, in, severe, environments, it, was, once, used, in, combination, with, independently, explosive, fuels, such, as, guanidine, nitrate, as, a, cheaper, but, less, stable, alternative, to, 5, aminotetrazole, in, the, inflators, of, airbags, manufactured, by, takata, corporation, which, were, recalled, as, unsafe, after, killing, 14, people, the, current, usa, death, total, is, 27, numerous, safety, guidelines, are, available, for, storing, and, handling, ammonium, nitrate, health, and, safety, data, are, shown, on, the, safety, data, sheets, available, from, suppliers, and, from, various, governments, pure, ammonium, nitrate, does, not, burn, but, as, a, strong, oxidizer, it, supports, and, accelerates, the, combustion, of, organic, and, some, inorganic, material, it, should, not, be, stored, near, combustible, substances, while, ammonium, nitrate, is, stable, at, ambient, temperature, and, pressure, under, many, conditions, it, may, detonate, from, a, strong, initiation, charge, it, should, not, be, stored, near, high, explosives, or, blasting, agents, molten, ammonium, nitrate, is, very, sensitive, to, shock, and, detonation, particularly, if, it, becomes, contaminated, with, incompatible, materials, such, as, combustibles, flammable, liquids, acids, chlorates, chlorides, sulfur, metals, charcoal, and, sawdust, contact, with, certain, substances, such, as, chlorates, mineral, acids, and, metal, sulfides, can, lead, to, vigorous, or, even, violent, decomposition, capable, of, igniting, nearby, combustible, material, or, detonating, ammonium, nitrate, begins, decomposition, after, melting, releasing, no, x, hno, 3, nh, 3, and, h, 2, o, it, should, not, be, heated, in, a, confined, space, the, resulting, heat, and, pressure, from, decomposition, increases, the, sensitivity, to, detonation, and, increases, the, speed, of, decomposition, detonation, may, occur, at, 80, atmospheres, contamination, can, reduce, this, to, 20, atmospheres, ammonium, nitrate, has, a, critical, relative, humidity, of, 59, 4, at, 30, c, at, higher, humidity, it, will, absorb, moisture, from, the, atmosphere, therefore, it, is, important, to, store, ammonium, nitrate, in, a, tightly, sealed, container, otherwise, it, can, coalesce, into, a, large, solid, mass, ammonium, nitrate, can, absorb, enough, moisture, to, liquefy, blending, ammonium, nitrate, with, certain, other, fertilizers, can, lower, the, critical, relative, humidity, the, potential, for, use, of, the, material, as, an, explosive, has, prompted, regulatory, measures, for, example, in, australia, the, dangerous, goods, regulations, came, into, effect, in, august, 2005, to, enforce, licensing, in, dealing, with, such, substances, licenses, are, granted, only, to, applicants, industry, with, appropriate, security, measures, in, place, to, prevent, any, misuse, additional, uses, such, as, education, and, research, purposes, may, also, be, considered, but, individual, use, will, not, employees, of, those, with, licenses, to, deal, with, the, substance, are, still, required, to, be, supervised, by, authorized, personnel, and, are, required, to, pass, a, security, and, national, police, check, before, a, license, may, be, granted, ammonium, nitrate, is, not, hazardous, to, health, and, is, usually, used, in, fertilizer, products, ammonium, nitrate, has, an, ld, 50, of, 2217, mg, kg, which, for, comparison, is, about, two, thirds, that, of, table, salt, ammonium, nitrate, decomposes, non, explosively, into, the, gases, nitrous, oxide, and, water, vapor, when, heated, however, it, can, be, induced, to, decompose, explosively, by, detonation, large, stockpiles, of, the, material, can, also, be, a, major, fire, risk, due, to, their, supporting, oxidation, a, situation, which, can, easily, escalate, to, detonation, explosions, are, not, uncommon, relatively, minor, incidents, occur, most, years, and, several, large, and, devastating, explosions, have, also, occurred, examples, include, the, oppau, explosion, of, 1921, one, of, the, largest, artificial, non, nuclear, explosions, the, texas, city, disaster, of, 1947, the, 2015, tianjin, explosions, in, china, and, the, 2020, beirut, explosion, ammonium, nitrate, can, explode, through, two, mechanisms
