a, mangrove, is, a, shrub, or, tree, that, grows, mainly, in, coastal, saline, or, brackish, water, mangroves, grow, in, an, equatorial, climate, typically, along, coastlines, and, tidal, rivers, they, have, special, adaptations, to, take, in, extra, oxygen, and, to, remove, salt, which, allow, them, to, tolerate, conditions, that, would, kill, most, plants, the, term, is, also, used, for, tropical, coastal, vegetation, consisting, of, such, species, mangroves, are, taxonomically, diverse, as, a, result, of, convergent, evolution, in, several, plant, families, they, occur, worldwide, in, the, tropics, and, subtropics, and, even, some, temperate, coastal, areas, mainly, between, latitudes, 30, n, and, 30, s, with, the, greatest, mangrove, area, within, 5, of, the, equator, mangrove, plant, families, first, appeared, during, the, late, cretaceous, to, paleocene, epochs, and, became, widely, distributed, in, part, due, to, the, movement, of, tectonic, plates, the, oldest, known, fossils, of, mangrove, palm, date, to, 75, million, years, ago, mangroves, are, salt, tolerant, trees, shrubs, and, ferns, also, called, halophytes, and, are, adapted, to, live, in, harsh, coastal, conditions, they, contain, a, complex, salt, filtration, system, and, a, complex, root, system, to, cope, with, saltwater, immersion, and, wave, action, they, are, adapted, to, the, low, oxygen, conditions, of, waterlogged, mud, but, are, most, likely, to, thrive, in, the, upper, half, of, the, intertidal, zone, the, mangrove, biome, often, called, the, mangrove, forest, or, mangal, is, a, distinct, saline, woodland, or, shrubland, habitat, characterized, by, depositional, coastal, environments, where, fine, sediments, often, with, high, organic, content, collect, in, areas, protected, from, high, energy, wave, action, mangrove, forests, serve, as, vital, habitats, for, a, diverse, array, of, aquatic, species, offering, a, unique, ecosystem, that, supports, the, intricate, interplay, of, marine, life, and, terrestrial, vegetation, the, saline, conditions, tolerated, by, various, mangrove, species, range, from, brackish, water, through, pure, seawater, 3, to, 4, salinity, to, water, concentrated, by, evaporation, to, over, twice, the, salinity, of, ocean, seawater, up, to, 9, salinity, beginning, in, 2010, remote, sensing, technologies, and, global, data, have, been, used, to, assess, areas, conditions, and, deforestation, rates, of, mangroves, around, the, world, in, 2018, the, global, mangrove, watch, initiative, released, a, new, global, baseline, which, estimates, the, total, mangrove, forest, area, of, the, world, as, of, 2010, at, 137, 600, km, 2, 53, 100, sq, mi, spanning, 118, countries, and, territories, a, 2022, study, on, losses, and, gains, of, tidal, wetlands, estimates, a, 3, 700, km, 2, 1, 400, sq, mi, net, decrease, in, global, mangrove, extent, from, 1999, to, 2019, mangrove, loss, continues, due, to, human, activity, with, a, global, annual, deforestation, rate, estimated, at, 0, 16, and, per, country, rates, as, high, as, 0, 70, degradation, in, quality, of, remaining, mangroves, is, also, an, important, concern, there, is, interest, in, mangrove, restoration, for, several, reasons, mangroves, support, sustainable, coastal, and, marine, ecosystems, they, protect, nearby, areas, from, tsunamis, and, extreme, weather, events, mangrove, forests, are, also, effective, at, carbon, sequestration, and, storage, the, success, of, mangrove, restoration, may, depend, heavily, on, engagement, with, local, stakeholders, and, on, careful, assessment, to, ensure, that, growing, conditions, will, be, suitable, for, the, species, chosen, the, international, day, for, the, conservation, of, the, mangrove, ecosystem, is, celebrated, every, year, on, 26, july, etymology, of, the, english, term, mangrove, can, only, be, speculative, and, is, disputed, 1, 2, the, term, may, have, come, to, english, from, the, portuguese, mangue, or, the, spanish, mangle, further, back, it, may, be, traced, to, south, america, and, cariban, and, arawakan, languages, such, as, ta, no, other, possibilities, include, the, malay, language, manggi, manggi, the, english, usage, may, reflect, a, corruption, via, folk, etymology, of, the, words, mangrow, and, grove, the, word, mangrove, is, used, in, at, least, three, senses, according, to, hogarth, 2015, among, the, recognized, mangrove, species, there, are, about, 70, species, in, 20, genera, from, 16, families, that, constitute, the, true, mangroves, species, that, occur, almost, exclusively, in, mangrove, habitats, demonstrating, convergent, evolution, many, of, these, species, found, similar, solutions, to, the, tropical, conditions, of, variable, salinity, tidal, range, inundation, anaerobic, soils, and, intense, sunlight, plant, biodiversity, is, generally, low, in, a, given, mangrove, the, greatest, biodiversity, of, mangroves, occurs, in, southeast, asia, particularly, in, the, indonesian, archipelago, the, red, mangrove, rhizophora, mangle, survives, in, the, most, inundated, areas, props, itself, above, the, water, level, with, stilt, or, prop, roots, and, then, absorbs, air, through, lenticels, in, its, bark, the, black, mangrove, avicennia, germinans, lives, on, higher, ground, and, develops, many, specialized, root, like, structures, called, pneumatophores, which, stick, up, out, of, the, soil, like, straws, for, breathing, these, breathing, tubes, typically, reach, heights, of, up, to, 30, cm, 12, in, and, in, some, species, over, 3, m, 9, 8, ft, the, roots, also, contain, wide, aerenchyma, to, facilitate, transport, within, the, plants, because, the, soil, is, perpetually, waterlogged, little, free, oxygen, is, available, anaerobic, bacteria, liberate, nitrogen, gas, soluble, ferrum, iron, inorganic, phosphates, sulfides, and, methane, which, make, the, soil, much, less, nutritious, pneumatophores, aerial, roots, allow, mangroves, to, absorb, gases, directly, from, the, atmosphere, and, other, nutrients, such, as, iron, from, the, inhospitable, soil, mangroves, store, gases, directly, inside, the, roots, processing, them, even, when, the, roots, are, submerged, during, high, tide, red, mangroves, exclude, salt, by, having, significantly, impermeable, roots, that, are, highly, suberised, impregnated, with, suberin, acting, as, an, ultrafiltration, mechanism, to, exclude, sodium, salts, from, the, rest, of, the, plant, one, study, found, that, roots, of, the, indian, mangrove, avicennia, officinalis, exclude, 90, to, 95, of, the, salt, in, water, taken, up, by, the, plant, depositing, the, excluded, salt, in, the, cortex, of, the, root, an, increase, in, the, production, of, suberin, and, in, the, activity, of, a, gene, regulating, cytochrome, p450, were, observed, in, correlation, with, an, increase, in, the, salinity, of, the, water, to, which, the, plant, was, exposed, in, a, frequently, cited, concept, that, has, become, known, as, the, sacrificial, leaf, salt, which, does, accumulate, in, the, shoot, sprout, then, concentrates, in, old, leaves, which, the, plant, then, sheds, however, recent, research, on, the, red, mangrove, rhizophora, mangle, suggests, that, the, older, yellowing, leaves, have, no, more, measurable, salt, content, than, the, other, greener, leaves, because, of, the, limited, fresh, water, available, in, salty, intertidal, soils, mangroves, limit, the, amount, of, water, they, lose, through, their, leaves, they, can, restrict, the, opening, of, their, stomata, pores, on, the, leaf, surfaces, which, exchange, carbon, dioxide, gas, and, water, vapor, during, photosynthesis, they, also, vary, the, orientation, of, their, leaves, to, avoid, the, harsh, midday, sun, and, so, reduce, evaporation, from, the, leaves, a, captive, red, mangrove, grows, only, if, its, leaves, are, misted, with, fresh, water, several, times, a, week, simulating, frequent, tropical, rainstorms, a, 2016, study, by, kim, et, al, investigated, the, biophysical, characteristics, of, sea, water, filtration, in, the, roots, of, the, mangrove, rhizophora, stylosa, from, a, plant, hydrodynamic, point, of, view, r, stylosa, can, grow, even, in, saline, water, and, the, salt, level, in, its, roots, is, regulated, within, a, certain, threshold, value, through, filtration, the, root, possesses, a, hierarchical, triple, layered, pore, structure, in, the, epidermis, and, most, na, ions, are, filtered, at, the, first, sublayer, of, the, outermost, layer, the, high, blockage, of, na, ions, is, attributed, to, the, high, surface, zeta, potential, of, the, first, layer, the, second, layer, which, is, composed, of, macroporous, structures, also, facilitates, na, ion, filtration, the, study, provides, insights, into, the, mechanism, underlying, water, filtration, through, halophyte, roots, and, could, serve, as, a, basis, for, the, development, of, a, bio, inspired, method, of, desalination, uptake, of, na, ions, is, desirable, for, halophytes, to, build, up, osmotic, potential, absorb, water, and, sustain, turgor, pressure, however, excess, na, ions, may, work, on, toxic, element, therefore, halophytes, try, to, adjust, salinity, delicately, between, growth, and, survival, strategies, in, this, point, of, view, a, novel, sustainable, desalination, method, can, be, derived, from, halophytes, which, are, in, contact, with, saline, water, through, their, roots, halophytes, exclude, salt, through, their, roots, secrete, the, accumulated, salt, through, their, aerial, parts, and, sequester, salt, in, senescent, leaves, and, or, the, bark, mangroves, are, facultative, halophytes, and, bruguiera, is, known, for, its, special, ultrafiltration, system, that, can, filter, approximately, 90, of, na, ions, from, the, surrounding, seawater, through, the, roots, the, species, also, exhibits, a, high, rate, of, salt, rejection, the, water, filtering, process, in, mangrove, roots, has, received, considerable, attention, for, several, decades, morphological, structures, of, plants, and, their, functions, have, been, evolved, through, a, long, history, to, survive, against, harsh, environmental, conditions, in, this, harsh, environment, mangroves, have, evolved, a, special, mechanism, to, help, their, offspring, survive, mangrove, seeds, are, buoyant, and, are, therefore, suited, to, water, dispersal, unlike, most, plants, whose, seeds, germinate, in, soil, many, mangroves, e, g, red, mangrove, are, viviparous, meaning, their, seeds, germinate, while, still, attached, to, the, parent, tree, once, germinated, the, seedling, grows, either, within, the, fruit, e, g, aegialitis, avicennia, and, aegiceras, or, out, through, the, fruit, e, g, rhizophora, ceriops, bruguiera, and, nypa, to, form, a, propagule, a, ready, to, go, seedling, which, can, produce, its, own, food, via, photosynthesis, the, mature, propagule, then, drops, into, the, water, which, can, transport, it, great, distances, propagules, can, survive, desiccation, and, remain, dormant, for, over, a, year, before, arriving, in, a, suitable, environment, once, a, propagule, is, ready, to, root, its, density, changes, so, that, the, elongated, shape, now, floats, vertically, rather, than, horizontally, in, this, position, it, is, more, likely, to, lodge, in, the, mud, and, root, if, it, does, not, root, it, can, alter, its, density, and, drift, again, in, search, of, more, favorable, conditions, the, following, listings, based, on, tomlinson, 2016, give, the, mangrove, species, in, each, listed, plant, genus, and, family, mangrove, environments, in, the, eastern, hemisphere, harbor, six, times, as, many, species, of, trees, and, shrubs, as, do, mangroves, in, the, new, world, genetic, divergence, of, mangrove, lineages, from, terrestrial, relatives, in, combination, with, fossil, evidence, suggests, mangrove, diversity, is, limited, by, evolutionary, transition, into, the, stressful, marine, environment, and, the, number, of, mangrove, lineages, has, increased, steadily, over, the, tertiary, with, little, global, extinction, mangroves, are, a, type, of, tropical, vegetation, with, some, outliers, established, in, subtropical, latitudes, notably, in, south, florida, and, southern, japan, as, well, as, south, africa, new, zealand, and, victoria, australia, these, outliers, result, either, from, unbroken, coastlines, and, island, chains, or, from, reliable, supplies, of, propagules, floating, on, warm, ocean, currents, from, rich, mangrove, regions, 57, at, the, limits, of, distribution, the, formation, is, represented, by, scrubby, usually, monotypic, avicennia, dominated, vegetation, as, at, westonport, bay, and, corner, inlet, victoria, australia, the, latter, locality, is, the, highest, latitude, 38, 45, s, at, which, mangroves, occur, naturally, the, mangroves, in, new, zealand, which, extend, as, far, south, as, 37, are, of, the, same, type, they, start, as, low, forest, in, the, northern, part, of, the, north, island, but, become, low, scrub, toward, their, southern, limit, in, both, instances, the, species, is, referred, to, as, avicennia, marina, var, australis, although, genetic, comparison, is, clearly, needed, in, western, australia, a, marina, extends, as, far, south, as, bunbury, 33, 19, s, in, the, northern, hemisphere, scrubby, avicennia, gerrninans, in, florida, occurs, as, far, north, as, st, augustine, on, the, east, coast, and, cedar, point, on, the, west, there, are, records, of, a, germinans, and, rhizophora, mangle, for, bermuda, presumably, supplied, by, the, gulf, stream, in, southern, japan, kandelia, obovata, occurs, to, about, 31, n, tagawa, in, hosakawa, et, al, 1977, but, initially, referred, to, as, k, candel, 57, mangrove, forests, also, called, mangrove, swamps, or, mangals, are, found, in, tropical, and, subtropical, tidal, areas, areas, where, mangroves, occur, include, estuaries, and, marine, shorelines, the, intertidal, existence, to, which, these, trees, are, adapted, represents, the, major, limitation, to, the, number, of, species, able, to, thrive, in, their, habitat, high, tide, brings, in, salt, water, and, when, the, tide, recedes, solar, evaporation, of, the, seawater, in, the, soil, leads, to, further, increases, in, salinity, the, return, of, tide, can, flush, out, these, soils, bringing, them, back, to, salinity, levels, comparable, to, that, of, seawater, at, low, tide, organisms, are, also, exposed, to, increases, in, temperature, and, reduced, moisture, before, being, then, cooled, and, flooded, by, the, tide, thus, for, a, plant, to, survive, in, this, environment, it, must, tolerate, broad, ranges, of, salinity, temperature, and, moisture, as, well, as, several, other, key, environmental, factors, thus, only, a, select, few, species, make, up, the, mangrove, tree, community, about, 110, species, are, considered, mangroves, in, the, sense, of, being, trees, that, grow, in, such, a, saline, swamp, though, only, a, few, are, from, the, mangrove, plant, genus, rhizophora, however, a, given, mangrove, swamp, typically, features, only, a, small, number, of, tree, species, it, is, not, uncommon, for, a, mangrove, forest, in, the, caribbean, to, feature, only, three, or, four, tree, species, for, comparison, the, tropical, rainforest, biome, contains, thousands, of, tree, species, but, this, is, not, to, say, mangrove, forests, lack, diversity, though, the, trees, themselves, are, few, in, species, the, ecosystem, that, these, trees, create, provides, a, home, habitat, for, a, great, variety, of, other, species, including, as, many, as, 174, species, of, marine, megafauna, mangrove, plants, require, a, number, of, physiological, adaptations, to, overcome, the, problems, of, low, environmental, oxygen, levels, high, salinity, and, frequent, tidal, flooding, each, species, has, its, own, solutions, to, these, problems, this, may, be, the, primary, reason, why, on, some, shorelines, mangrove, tree, species, show, distinct, zonation, small, environmental, variations, within, a, mangal, may, lead, to, greatly, differing, methods, for, coping, with, the, environment, therefore, the, mix, of, species, is, partly, determined, by, the, tolerances, of, individual, species, to, physical, conditions, such, as, tidal, flooding, and, salinity, but, may, also, be, influenced, by, other, factors, such, as, crabs, preying, on, plant, seedlings, once, established, mangrove, roots, provide, an, oyster, habitat, and, slow, water, flow, thereby, enhancing, sediment, deposition, in, areas, where, it, is, already, occurring, the, fine, anoxic, sediments, under, mangroves, act, as, sinks, for, a, variety, of, heavy, trace, metals, which, colloidal, particles, in, the, sediments, have, concentrated, from, the, water, mangrove, removal, disturbs, these, underlying, sediments, often, creating, problems, of, trace, metal, contamination, of, seawater, and, organisms, of, the, area, mangrove, swamps, protect, coastal, areas, from, erosion, storm, surge, especially, during, tropical, cyclones, and, tsunamis, they, limit, high, energy, wave, erosion, mainly, during, events, such, as, storm, surges, and, tsunamis, the, mangroves, massive, root, systems, are, efficient, at, dissipating, wave, energy, likewise, they, slow, down, tidal, water, so, that, its, sediment, is, deposited, as, the, tide, comes, in, leaving, all, except, fine, particles, when, the, tide, ebbs, in, this, way, mangroves, build, their, environments, because, of, the, uniqueness, of, mangrove, ecosystems, and, the, protection, against, erosion, they, provide, they, are, often, the, object, of, conservation, programs, including, national, biodiversity, action, plans, the, unique, ecosystem, found, in, the, intricate, mesh, of, mangrove, roots, offers, a, quiet, marine, habitat, for, young, organisms, in, areas, where, roots, are, permanently, submerged, the, organisms, they, host, include, algae, barnacles, oysters, sponges, and, bryozoans, which, all, require, a, hard, surface, for, anchoring, while, they, filter, feed, shrimps, and, mud, lobsters, use, the, muddy, bottoms, as, their, home, mangrove, crabs, eat, the, mangrove, leaves, adding, nutrients, to, the, mangal, mud, for, other, bottom, feeders, in, at, least, some, cases, the, export, of, carbon, fixed, in, mangroves, is, important, in, coastal, food, webs, mangrove, forests, contribute, significantly, to, coastal, ecosystems, by, fostering, complex, and, diverse, food, webs, the, intricate, root, systems, of, mangroves, create, a, habitat, conducive, to, the, proliferation, of, microorganisms, crustaceans, and, small, fish, forming, the, foundational, tiers, of, the, food, chain, this, abundance, of, organisms, serves, as, a, critical, food, source, for, larger, predators, like, birds, reptiles, and, mammals, within, the, ecosystem, additionally, mangrove, forests, function, as, essential, nurseries, for, many, commercially, important, fish, species, providing, a, sheltered, environment, rich, in, nutrients, during, their, early, life, stages, the, decomposition, of, leaves, and, organic, matter, in, the, water, further, enhances, the, nutrient, content, supporting, overall, ecosystem, productivity, in, summary, mangrove, forests, play, a, crucial, and, unbiased, role, in, sustaining, biodiversity, and, ecological, balance, within, coastal, food, webs, larger, marine, organisms, benefit, from, the, habitat, as, a, nursery, for, their, offspring, lemon, sharks, depend, on, mangrove, creeks, to, give, birth, to, their, pups, the, ecosystem, provides, little, competition, and, minimizes, threats, of, predation, to, juvenile, lemon, sharks, as, they, use, the, cover, of, mangroves, to, practice, hunting, before, entering, the, food, web, of, the, ocean, mangrove, plantations, in, vietnam, thailand, philippines, and, india, host, several, commercially, important, species, of, fish, and, crustaceans, the, mangrove, food, chain, extends, beyond, the, marine, ecosystem, coastal, bird, species, inhabit, the, tidal, ecosystems, feeding, off, small, marine, organisms, and, wetland, insects, common, bird, families, found, in, mangroves, around, the, world, are, egrets, kingfishers, herons, and, hornbills, among, many, others, dependent, on, ecological, range, bird, predation, plays, a, key, role, in, maintaining, prey, species, along, coastlines, and, within, mangrove, ecosystems, mangrove, forests, can, decay, into, peat, deposits, because, of, fungal, and, bacterial, processes, as, well, as, by, the, action, of, termites, it, becomes, peat, in, good, geochemical, sedimentary, and, tectonic, conditions, the, nature, of, these, deposits, depends, on, the, environment, and, the, types, of, mangroves, involved, in, puerto, rico, the, red, white, and, black, mangroves, occupy, different, ecological, niches, and, have, slightly, different, chemical, compositions, so, the, carbon, content, varies, between, the, species, as, well, between, the, different, tissues, of, the, plant, e, g, leaf, matter, versus, roots, in, puerto, rico, there, is, a, clear, succession, of, these, three, trees, from, the, lower, elevations, which, are, dominated, by, red, mangroves, to, farther, inland, with, a, higher, concentration, of, white, mangroves, mangrove, forests, are, an, important, part, of, the, cycling, and, storage, of, carbon, in, tropical, coastal, ecosystems, knowing, this, scientists, seek, to, reconstruct, the, environment, and, investigate, changes, to, the, coastal, ecosystem, over, thousands, of, years, using, sediment, cores, however, an, additional, complication, is, the, imported, marine, organic, matter, that, also, gets, deposited, in, the, sediment, due, to, the, tidal, flushing, of, mangrove, forests, termites, play, an, important, role, in, the, formation, of, peat, from, mangrove, materials, they, process, fallen, leaf, litter, root, systems, and, wood, from, mangroves, into, peat, to, build, their, nests, and, stabilise, the, chemistry, of, this, peat, that, represents, approximately, 2, of, above, ground, carbon, storage, in, mangroves, as, the, nests, are, buried, over, time, this, carbon, is, stored, in, the, sediment, and, the, carbon, cycle, continues, mangroves, are, an, important, source, of, blue, carbon, globally, mangroves, stored, 4, 19, gt, 9, 2, 10, 12, lb, of, carbon, in, 2012, two, percent, of, global, mangrove, carbon, was, lost, between, 2000, and, 2012, equivalent, to, a, maximum, potential, of, 0, 316996250, gt, 6, 9885710, 10, 11, lb, of, emissions, of, carbon, dioxide, in, earth, s, atmosphere, globally, mangroves, have, been, shown, to, provide, measurable, economic, protections, to, coastal, communities, affected, by, tropical, storms, plant, microbiomes, play, crucial, roles, in, the, health, and, productivity, of, mangroves, many, researchers, have, successfully, applied, knowledge, acquired, about, plant, microbiomes, to, produce, specific, inocula, for, crop, protection, such, inocula, can, stimulate, plant, growth, by, releasing, phytohormones, and, enhancing, uptake, of, some, mineral, nutrients, particularly, phosphorus, and, nitrogen, however, most, of, the, plant, microbiome, studies, have, focused, on, the, model, plant, arabidopsis, thaliana, and, economically, important, crop, plants, such, as, rice, barley, wheat, maize, and, soybean, there, is, less, information, on, the, microbiomes, of, tree, species, plant, microbiomes, are, determined, by, plant, related, factors, e, g, genotype, organ, species, and, health, status, and, environmental, factors, e, g, land, use, climate, and, nutrient, availability, two, of, the, plant, related, factors, plant, species, and, genotypes, have, been, shown, to, play, significant, roles, in, shaping, rhizosphere, and, plant, microbiomes, as, tree, genotypes, and, species, are, associated, with, specific, microbial, communities, different, plant, organs, also, have, specific, microbial, communities, depending, on, plant, associated, factors, plant, genotype, available, nutrients, and, organ, specific, physicochemical, conditions, and, environmental, conditions, associated, with, aboveground, and, underground, surfaces, and, disturbances, mangrove, roots, harbour, a, repertoire, of, microbial, taxa, that, contribute, to, important, ecological, functions, in, mangrove, ecosystems, like, typical, terrestrial, plants, mangroves, depend, upon, mutually, beneficial, interactions, with, microbial, communities, in, particular, microbes, residing, in, developed, roots, could, help, mangroves, transform, nutrients, into, usable, forms, before, plant, assimilation, these, microbes, also, provide, mangroves, phytohormones, for, suppressing, phytopathogens, or, helping, mangroves, withstand, heat, and, salinity, in, turn, root, associated, microbes, receive, carbon, metabolites, from, the, plant, via, root, exudates, thus, close, associations, between, the, plant, and, microbes, are, established, for, their, mutual, benefits, the, taxonomic, class, level, shows, that, most, proteobacteria, were, reported, to, come, from, gammaproteobacteria, followed, by, deltaproteobacteria, and, alphaproteobacteria, the, diverse, function, and, the, phylogenic, variation, of, gammaproteobacteria, which, consisted, of, orders, such, as, alteromonadales, and, vibrionales, are, found, in, marine, and, coastal, regions, and, are, high, in, abundance, in, mangrove, sediments, functioning, as, nutrient, recyclers, members, of, deltaproteobacteria, found, in, mangrove, soil, are, mostly, sulfur, related, consisting, of, desulfobacterales, desulfuromonadales, desulfovibrionales, and, desulfarculales, among, others, highly, diverse, microbial, communities, mainly, bacteria, and, fungi, have, been, found, to, inhabit, and, function, in, mangrove, roots, for, example, diazotrophic, bacteria, in, the, vicinity, of, mangrove, roots, could, perform, biological, nitrogen, fixation, which, provides, 40, 60, of, the, total, nitrogen, required, by, mangroves, the, soil, attached, to, mangrove, roots, lacks, oxygen, but, is, rich, in, organic, matter, providing, an, optimal, microenvironment, for, sulfate, reducing, bacteria, and, methanogens, ligninolytic, cellulolytic, and, amylolytic, fungi, are, prevalent, in, the, mangrove, root, environment, rhizosphere, fungi, could, help, mangroves, survive, in, waterlogged, and, nutrient, restricted, environments, these, studies, have, provided, increasing, evidence, to, support, the, importance, of, root, associated, bacteria, and, fungi, for, mangrove, growth, and, health, recent, studies, have, investigated, the, detailed, structure, of, root, associated, microbial, communities, at, a, continuous, fine, scale, in, other, plants, where, a, microhabitat, was, divided, into, four, root, compartments, endosphere, episphere, rhizosphere, and, nonrhizosphere, or, bulk, soil, moreover, the, microbial, communities, in, each, compartment, have, been, reported, to, have, unique, characteristics, root, exudates, selectively, enrich, adapted, microbial, populations, however, these, exudates, were, found, to, exert, only, marginal, impacts, on, microbes, in, the, bulk, soil, outside, the, rhizosphere, furthermore, it, was, noted, that, the, root, episphere, rather, than, the, rhizosphere, was, primarily, responsible, for, controlling, the, entry, of, specific, microbial, populations, into, the, root, resulting, in, the, selective, enrichment, of, proteobacteria, in, the, endosphere, these, findings, provide, new, insights, into, the, niche, differentiation, of, root, associated, microbial, communities, nevertheless, amplicon, based, community, profiling, may, not, provide, the, functional, characteristics, of, root, associated, microbial, communities, in, plant, growth, and, biogeochemical, cycling, unraveling, functional, patterns, across, the, four, root, compartments, holds, a, great, potential, for, understanding, functional, mechanisms, responsible, for, mediating, root, microbe, interactions, in, support, of, enhancing, mangrove, ecosystem, functioning, the, diversity, of, bacteria, in, disturbed, mangroves, is, reported, to, be, higher, than, in, well, preserved, mangroves, studies, comparing, mangroves, in, different, conservation, states, show, that, bacterial, composition, in, disturbed, mangrove, sediment, alters, its, structure, leading, to, a, functional, equilibrium, where, the, dynamics, of, chemicals, in, mangrove, soils, lead, to, the, remodeling, of, its, microbial, structure, despite, many, research, advancements, in, mangrove, sediment, bacterial, metagenomics, diversity, in, various, conditions, over, the, past, few, years, bridging, the, research, gap, and, expanding, our, knowledge, towards, the, relationship, between, microbes, mainly, constituted, of, bacteria, and, its, nutrient, cycles, in, the, mangrove, sediment, and, direct, and, indirect, impacts, on, mangrove, growth, and, stand, structures, as, coastal, barriers, and, other, ecological, service, providers, thus, based, on, studies, by, lai, et, al, s, systematic, review, here, they, suggest, sampling, improvements, and, a, fundamental, environmental, index, for, future, reference, mangrove, forests, are, one, of, the, most, carbon, rich, biomes, accounting, for, 11, of, the, total, input, of, terrestrial, carbon, into, oceans, viruses, are, thought, to, significantly, influence, local, and, global, biogeochemical, cycles, though, as, of, 2019, little, information, was, available, about, the, community, structure, genetic, diversity, and, ecological, roles, of, viruses, in, mangrove, ecosystems, viruses, are, the, most, abundant, biological, entities, on, earth, present, in, virtually, all, ecosystems, by, lysing, their, hosts, that, is, by, rupturing, their, cell, membranes, viruses, control, host, abundance, and, affect, the, structure, of, host, communities, viruses, also, influence, their, host, diversity, and, evolution, through, horizontal, gene, transfer, selection, for, resistance, and, manipulation, of, bacterial, metabolisms, importantly, marine, viruses, affect, local, and, global, biogeochemical, cycles, through, the, release, of, substantial, amounts, of, organic, carbon, and, nutrients, from, hosts, and, assist, microbes, in, driving, biogeochemical, cycles, with, auxiliary, metabolic, genes, amgs, it, is, presumed, amgs, augment, viral, infected, host, metabolism, and, facilitate, the, production, of, new, viruses, amgs, have, been, extensively, explored, in, marine, cyanophages, and, include, genes, involved, in, photosynthesis, carbon, turnover, phosphate, uptake, and, stress, response, cultivation, independent, metagenomic, analysis, of, viral, communities, has, identified, additional, amgs, that, are, involved, in, motility, central, carbon, metabolism, photosystem, i, energy, metabolism, iron, sulphur, clusters, anti, oxidation, and, sulphur, and, nitrogen, cycling, interestingly, a, recent, analysis, of, pacific, ocean, virome, data, identified, niche, specialised, amgs, that, contribute, to, depth, stratified, host, adaptations, given, that, microbes, drive, global, biogeochemical, cycles, and, a, large, fraction, of, microbes, is, infected, by, viruses, at, any, given, time, viral, encoded, amgs, must, play, important, roles, in, global, biogeochemistry, and, microbial, metabolic, evolution, mangrove, forests, are, the, only, woody, halophytes, that, live, in, salt, water, along, the, world, s, subtropical, and, tropical, coastlines, mangroves, are, one, of, the, most, productive, and, ecologically, important, ecosystems, on, earth, the, rates, of, primary, production, of, mangroves, equal, those, of, tropical, humid, evergreen, forests, and, coral, reefs, as, a, globally, relevant, component, of, the, carbon, cycle, mangroves, sequester, approximately, 24, million, metric, tons, of, carbon, each, year, most, mangrove, carbon, is, stored, in, soil, and, sizable, belowground, pools, of, dead, roots, aiding, in, the, conservation, and, recycling, of, nutrients, beneath, forests, although, mangroves, cover, only, 0, 5, of, the, earth, s, coastal, area, they, account, for, 10, 15, of, the, coastal, sediment, carbon, storage, and, 10, 11, of, the, total, input, of, terrestrial, carbon, into, oceans, the, disproportionate, contribution, of, mangroves, to, carbon, sequestration, is, now, perceived, as, an, important, means, to, counterbalance, greenhouse, gas, emissions, despite, the, ecological, importance, of, mangrove, ecosystem, knowledge, on, mangrove, biodiversity, is, notably, limited, previous, reports, mainly, investigated, the, biodiversity, of, mangrove, fauna, flora, and, bacterial, communities, particularly, little, information, is, available, about, viral, communities, and, their, roles, in, mangrove, soil, ecosystems, in, view, of, the, importance, of, viruses, in, structuring, and, regulating, host, communities, and, mediating, element, biogeochemical, cycles, exploring, viral, communities, in, mangrove, ecosystems, is, essential, additionally, the, intermittent, flooding, of, sea, water, and, resulting, sharp, transition, of, mangrove, environments, may, result, in, substantially, different, genetic, and, functional, diversity, of, bacterial, and, viral, communities, in, mangrove, soils, compared, with, those, of, other, systems
