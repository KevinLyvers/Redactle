polaris, is, a, star, in, the, northern, circumpolar, constellation, of, ursa, minor, it, is, designated, ursae, minoris, latinized, to, alpha, ursae, minoris, and, is, commonly, called, the, north, star, or, pole, star, with, an, apparent, magnitude, that, fluctuates, around, 1, 98, it, is, the, brightest, star, in, the, constellation, and, is, readily, visible, to, the, naked, eye, at, night, the, position, of, the, star, lies, less, than, 1, away, from, the, north, celestial, pole, making, it, the, current, northern, pole, star, the, stable, position, of, the, star, in, the, northern, sky, makes, it, useful, for, navigation, as, the, closest, cepheid, variable, its, distance, is, used, as, part, of, the, cosmic, distance, ladder, the, revised, hipparcos, stellar, parallax, gives, a, distance, to, polaris, of, about, 433, light, years, 133, parsecs, while, the, successor, mission, gaia, gives, a, distance, of, about, 448, light, years, 137, parsecs, calculations, by, other, methods, vary, widely, although, appearing, to, the, naked, eye, as, a, single, point, of, light, polaris, is, a, triple, star, system, composed, of, the, primary, a, yellow, supergiant, designated, polaris, aa, in, orbit, with, a, smaller, companion, polaris, ab, the, pair, is, in, a, wider, orbit, with, polaris, b, the, outer, pair, ab, were, discovered, in, august, 1779, by, william, herschel, where, the, a, refers, to, what, is, now, known, to, be, the, aa, ab, pair, polaris, aa, is, an, evolved, yellow, supergiant, of, spectral, type, f7ib, with, 5, 4, solar, masses, m, it, is, the, first, classical, cepheid, to, have, a, mass, determined, from, its, orbit, the, two, smaller, companions, are, polaris, b, a, 1, 39, m, f3, main, sequence, star, orbiting, at, a, distance, of, 2, 400, astronomical, units, au, and, polaris, ab, or, p, a, very, close, f6, main, sequence, star, with, a, mass, of, 1, 26, m, polaris, b, can, be, resolved, with, a, modest, telescope, william, herschel, discovered, the, star, in, august, 1779, using, a, reflecting, telescope, of, his, own, one, of, the, best, telescopes, of, the, time, in, january, 2006, nasa, released, images, from, the, hubble, telescope, that, showed, the, three, members, of, the, polaris, ternary, system, the, variable, radial, velocity, of, polaris, a, was, reported, by, w, w, campbell, in, 1899, which, suggested, this, star, is, a, binary, system, since, polaris, a, is, a, known, cepheid, variable, j, h, moore, in, 1927, demonstrated, that, the, changes, in, velocity, along, the, line, of, sight, were, due, to, a, combination, of, the, four, day, pulsation, period, combined, with, a, much, longer, orbital, period, and, a, large, eccentricity, of, around, 0, 6, moore, published, preliminary, orbital, elements, of, the, system, in, 1929, giving, an, orbital, period, of, about, 29, 7, years, with, an, eccentricity, of, 0, 63, this, period, was, confirmed, by, proper, motion, studies, performed, by, b, p, gerasimovi, in, 1939, as, part, of, her, doctoral, thesis, in, 1955, e, roemer, used, radial, velocity, data, to, derive, an, orbital, period, of, 30, 46, y, for, the, polaris, a, system, with, an, eccentricity, of, 0, 64, k, w, kamper, in, 1996, produced, refined, elements, with, a, period, of, 29, 59, 0, 02, years, and, an, eccentricity, of, 0, 608, 0, 005, in, 2019, a, study, by, r, i, anderson, gave, a, period, of, 29, 32, 0, 11, years, with, an, eccentricity, of, 0, 620, 0, 008, there, were, once, thought, to, be, two, more, widely, separated, components, polaris, c, and, polaris, d, but, these, have, been, shown, not, to, be, physically, associated, with, the, polaris, system, polaris, aa, the, supergiant, primary, component, is, a, low, amplitude, population, i, classical, cepheid, variable, although, it, was, once, thought, to, be, a, type, ii, cepheid, due, to, its, high, galactic, latitude, cepheids, constitute, an, important, standard, candle, for, determining, distance, so, polaris, as, the, closest, such, star, is, heavily, studied, the, variability, of, polaris, had, been, suspected, since, 1852, this, variation, was, confirmed, by, ejnar, hertzsprung, in, 1911, the, range, of, brightness, of, polaris, is, given, as, 1, 86, 2, 13, but, the, amplitude, has, changed, since, discovery, prior, to, 1963, the, amplitude, was, over, 0, 1, magnitude, and, was, very, gradually, decreasing, after, 1966, it, very, rapidly, decreased, until, it, was, less, than, 0, 05, magnitude, since, then, it, has, erratically, varied, near, that, range, it, has, been, reported, that, the, amplitude, is, now, increasing, again, a, reversal, not, seen, in, any, other, cepheid, the, period, roughly, 4, days, has, also, changed, over, time, it, has, steadily, increased, by, around, 4, 5, seconds, per, year, except, for, a, hiatus, in, 1963, 1965, this, was, originally, thought, to, be, due, to, secular, redward, lower, temperature, evolution, across, the, cepheid, instability, strip, but, it, may, be, due, to, interference, between, the, primary, and, the, first, overtone, pulsation, modes, authors, disagree, on, whether, polaris, is, a, fundamental, or, first, overtone, pulsator, and, on, whether, it, is, crossing, the, instability, strip, for, the, first, time, or, not, the, temperature, of, polaris, varies, by, only, a, small, amount, during, its, pulsations, but, the, amount, of, this, variation, is, variable, and, unpredictable, the, erratic, changes, of, temperature, and, the, amplitude, of, temperature, changes, during, each, cycle, from, less, than, 50, k, to, at, least, 170, k, may, be, related, to, the, orbit, with, polaris, ab, research, reported, in, science, suggests, that, polaris, is, 2, 5, times, brighter, today, than, when, ptolemy, observed, it, changing, from, third, to, second, magnitude, astronomer, edward, guinan, considers, this, to, be, a, remarkable, change, and, is, on, record, as, saying, that, if, they, are, real, these, changes, are, 100, times, larger, than, predicted, by, current, theories, of, stellar, evolution, in, 2024, researchers, led, by, nancy, evans, at, the, harvard, smithsonian, have, studied, with, more, accuracy, the, polaris, smaller, companion, orbit, using, the, chara, array, during, this, observation, campaign, they, have, succeeded, in, shooting, polaris, features, on, its, surface, large, bright, places, and, dark, ones, have, appeared, in, close, up, images, changing, over, time, further, polaris, diameter, size, has, been, re, measured, to, 46, r, using, the, gaia, distance, of, 446, 1, light, years, and, its, mass, was, determined, at, 5, 13, m, because, polaris, lies, nearly, in, a, direct, line, with, the, earth, s, rotational, axis, above, the, north, pole, the, north, celestial, pole, polaris, stands, almost, motionless, in, the, sky, and, all, the, stars, of, the, northern, sky, appear, to, rotate, around, it, therefore, it, makes, an, excellent, fixed, point, from, which, to, draw, measurements, for, celestial, navigation, and, for, astrometry, the, elevation, of, the, star, above, the, horizon, gives, the, approximate, latitude, of, the, observer, in, 2018, polaris, was, 0, 66, 39, 6, arcminutes, away, from, the, pole, of, rotation, 1, 4, times, the, moon, disc, and, so, revolves, around, the, pole, in, a, small, circle, 1, 3, in, diameter, it, will, be, closest, to, the, pole, about, 0, 45, degree, or, 27, arcminutes, soon, after, the, year, 2100, because, it, is, so, close, to, the, celestial, north, pole, its, right, ascension, is, changing, rapidly, due, to, the, precession, of, earth, s, axis, going, from, 2, 5h, in, ad, 2000, to, 6h, in, ad, 2100, twice, in, each, sidereal, day, polaris, s, azimuth, is, true, north, the, rest, of, the, time, it, is, displaced, eastward, or, westward, and, the, bearing, must, be, corrected, using, tables, or, a, rule, of, thumb, the, best, approximation, is, made, using, the, leading, edge, of, the, big, dipper, asterism, in, the, constellation, ursa, major, the, leading, edge, defined, by, the, stars, dubhe, and, merak, is, referenced, to, a, clock, face, and, the, true, azimuth, of, polaris, worked, out, for, different, latitudes, the, apparent, motion, of, polaris, towards, and, in, the, future, away, from, the, celestial, pole, is, due, to, the, precession, of, the, equinoxes, the, celestial, pole, will, move, away, from, umi, after, the, 21st, century, passing, close, by, gamma, cephei, by, about, the, 41st, century, moving, towards, deneb, by, about, the, 91st, century, the, celestial, pole, was, close, to, thuban, around, 2750, bc, and, during, classical, antiquity, it, was, slightly, closer, to, kochab, umi, than, to, polaris, although, still, about, 10, from, either, star, it, was, about, the, same, angular, distance, from, umi, as, to, umi, by, the, end, of, late, antiquity, the, greek, navigator, pytheas, in, ca, 320, bc, described, the, celestial, pole, as, devoid, of, stars, however, as, one, of, the, brighter, stars, close, to, the, celestial, pole, polaris, was, used, for, navigation, at, least, from, late, antiquity, and, described, as, aei, phan, s, always, visible, by, stobaeus, 5th, century, also, termed, lychnos, akin, to, a, burner, or, lamp, and, would, reasonably, be, described, as, stella, polaris, from, about, the, high, middle, ages, and, onwards, both, in, greek, and, latin, on, his, first, trans, atlantic, voyage, in, 1492, christopher, columbus, had, to, correct, for, the, circle, described, by, the, pole, star, about, the, pole, in, shakespeare, s, play, julius, caesar, written, around, 1599, caesar, describes, himself, as, being, as, constant, as, the, northern, star, though, in, caesar, s, time, there, was, no, constant, northern, star, despite, its, relative, brightness, it, is, not, as, is, popularly, believed, the, brightest, star, in, the, sky, polaris, was, referenced, in, nathaniel, bowditch, s, 1802, book, american, practical, navigator, where, it, is, listed, as, one, of, the, navigational, stars, the, modern, name, polaris, is, shortened, from, neo, latin, stella, polaris, polar, star, coined, in, the, renaissance, when, the, star, had, approached, the, celestial, pole, to, within, a, few, degrees, gemma, frisius, writing, in, 1547, referred, to, it, as, stella, illa, quae, polaris, dicitur, that, star, which, is, called, polar, placing, it, 3, 8, from, the, celestial, pole, in, 2016, the, international, astronomical, union, organized, a, working, group, on, star, names, wgsn, to, catalog, and, standardize, proper, names, for, stars, the, wgsn, s, first, bulletin, of, july, 2016, included, a, table, of, the, first, two, batches, of, names, approved, by, the, wgsn, which, included, polaris, for, the, star, ursae, minoris, aa, in, antiquity, polaris, was, not, yet, the, closest, naked, eye, star, to, the, celestial, pole, and, the, entire, constellation, of, ursa, minor, was, used, for, navigation, rather, than, any, single, star, polaris, moved, close, enough, to, the, pole, to, be, the, closest, naked, eye, star, even, though, still, at, a, distance, of, several, degrees, in, the, early, medieval, period, and, numerous, names, referring, to, this, characteristic, as, polar, star, have, been, in, use, since, the, medieval, period, in, old, english, it, was, known, as, scip, steorra, ship, star, in, the, old, english, rune, poem, the, t, rune, is, apparently, associated, with, a, circumpolar, constellation, or, the, planet, mars, in, the, hindu, puranas, it, became, personified, under, the, name, dhruva, immovable, fixed, in, the, later, medieval, period, it, became, associated, with, the, marian, title, of, stella, maris, star, of, the, sea, so, in, bartholomaeus, anglicus, c, 1270s, due, to, an, earlier, transcription, error, an, older, english, name, attested, since, the, 14th, century, is, lodestar, guiding, star, cognate, with, the, old, norse, lei, arstjarna, middle, high, german, leitsterne, the, ancient, name, of, the, constellation, ursa, minor, cynosura, from, the, greek, the, dog, s, tail, became, associated, with, the, pole, star, in, particular, by, the, early, modern, period, an, explicit, identification, of, mary, as, stella, maris, with, the, polar, star, stella, polaris, as, well, as, the, use, of, cynosura, as, a, name, of, the, star, is, evident, in, the, title, cynosura, seu, mariana, stella, polaris, i, e, cynosure, or, the, marian, polar, star, a, collection, of, marian, poetry, published, by, nicolaus, lucensis, niccolo, barsotti, de, lucca, in, 1655, its, name, in, traditional, pre, islamic, arab, astronomy, was, al, judayy, the, kid, in, the, sense, of, a, juvenile, goat, in, description, des, etoiles, fixes, and, that, name, was, used, in, medieval, islamic, astronomy, as, well, in, those, times, it, was, not, yet, as, close, to, the, north, celestial, pole, as, it, is, now, and, used, to, rotate, around, the, pole, it, was, invoked, as, a, symbol, of, steadfastness, in, poetry, as, steadfast, star, by, spenser, shakespeare, s, sonnet, 116, is, an, example, of, the, symbolism, of, the, north, star, as, a, guiding, principle, is, the, star, to, every, wandering, bark, whose, worth, s, unknown, although, his, height, be, taken, in, julius, caesar, he, has, caesar, explain, his, refusal, to, grant, a, pardon, by, saying, i, am, as, constant, as, the, northern, star, of, whose, true, fixed, and, resting, quality, there, is, no, fellow, in, the, firmament, the, skies, are, painted, with, unnumbered, sparks, they, are, all, fire, and, every, one, doth, shine, but, there, s, but, one, in, all, doth, hold, his, place, so, in, the, world, iii, i, 65, 71, of, course, polaris, will, not, constantly, remain, as, the, north, star, due, to, precession, but, this, is, only, noticeable, over, centuries, in, inuit, astronomy, polaris, is, known, as, nuutuittuq, syllabics, it, is, depicted, on, the, flag, and, coat, of, arms, of, the, canadian, inuit, territory, of, nunavut, as, well, as, on, the, flag, of, the, u, s, state, of, alaska, in, traditional, lakota, star, knowledge, polaris, is, named, wi, h, pi, ow, ila, this, translates, to, the, star, that, sits, still, this, name, comes, from, a, lakota, story, in, which, he, married, t, ap, w, red, cheeked, woman, however, she, fell, from, the, heavens, and, in, his, grief, wi, h, pi, ow, ila, stared, down, from, wa, k, tu, the, above, land, forever, the, plains, cree, call, the, star, in, nehiyawewin, ac, hkos, k, k, hc, t, the, star, that, does, not, move, syllabics, in, mi, kmawi, simk, the, star, is, named, tatapn, in, the, ancient, finnish, worldview, the, north, star, has, also, been, called, taivaannapa, and, naulat, hti, the, nailstar, because, it, seems, to, be, attached, to, the, firmament, or, even, to, act, as, a, fastener, for, the, sky, when, other, stars, orbit, it, since, the, starry, sky, seemed, to, rotate, around, it, the, firmament, is, thought, of, as, a, wheel, with, the, star, as, the, pivot, on, its, axis, the, names, derived, from, it, were, sky, pin, and, world, pin, many, recent, papers, calculate, the, distance, to, polaris, at, about, 433, light, years, 133, parsecs, based, on, parallax, measurements, from, the, hipparcos, astrometry, satellite, older, distance, estimates, were, often, slightly, less, and, research, based, on, high, resolution, spectral, analysis, suggests, it, may, be, up, to, 110, light, years, closer, 323, ly, 99, pc, polaris, is, the, closest, cepheid, variable, to, earth, so, its, physical, parameters, are, of, critical, importance, to, the, whole, astronomical, distance, scale, it, is, also, the, only, one, with, a, dynamically, measured, mass, the, hipparcos, spacecraft, used, stellar, parallax, to, take, measurements, from, 1989, and, 1993, with, the, accuracy, of, 0, 97, milliarcseconds, 970, microarcseconds, and, it, obtained, accurate, measurements, for, stellar, distances, up, to, 1, 000, pc, away, the, hipparcos, data, was, examined, again, with, more, advanced, error, correction, and, statistical, techniques, despite, the, advantages, of, hipparcos, astrometry, the, uncertainty, in, its, polaris, data, has, been, pointed, out, and, some, researchers, have, questioned, the, accuracy, of, hipparcos, when, measuring, binary, cepheids, like, polaris, the, hipparcos, reduction, specifically, for, polaris, has, been, re, examined, and, reaffirmed, but, there, is, still, not, widespread, agreement, about, the, distance, the, next, major, step, in, high, precision, parallax, measurements, comes, from, gaia, a, space, astrometry, mission, launched, in, 2013, and, intended, to, measure, stellar, parallax, to, within, 25, microarcseconds, as, although, it, was, originally, planned, to, limit, gaia, s, observations, to, stars, fainter, than, magnitude, 5, 7, tests, carried, out, during, the, commissioning, phase, indicated, that, gaia, could, autonomously, identify, stars, as, bright, as, magnitude, 3, when, gaia, entered, regular, scientific, operations, in, july, 2014, it, was, configured, to, routinely, process, stars, in, the, magnitude, range, 3, 20, beyond, that, limit, special, procedures, are, used, to, download, raw, scanning, data, for, the, remaining, 230, stars, brighter, than, magnitude, 3, methods, to, reduce, and, analyse, these, data, are, being, developed, and, it, is, expected, that, there, will, be, complete, sky, coverage, at, the, bright, end, with, standard, errors, of, a, few, dozen, as, gaia, data, release, 2, does, not, include, a, parallax, for, polaris, but, a, distance, inferred, from, it, is, 136, 6, 0, 5, pc, 445, 5, ly, for, polaris, b, somewhat, further, than, most, previous, estimates, and, several, times, more, accurate, this, was, further, improved, to, 137, 2, 0, 3, pc, 447, 6, ly, upon, publication, of, the, gaia, data, release, 3, catalog, on, 13, june, 2022, which, superseded, gaia, data, release, 2, polaris, is, depicted, in, the, newly, adopted, flag, of, the, u, s, state, of, minnesota
