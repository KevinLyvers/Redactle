feldspar, f, l, d, s, p, r, fel, d, spar, sometimes, spelled, felspar, is, a, group, of, rock, forming, aluminium, tectosilicate, minerals, also, containing, other, cations, such, as, sodium, calcium, potassium, or, barium, the, most, common, members, of, the, feldspar, group, are, the, plagioclase, sodium, calcium, feldspars, and, the, alkali, potassium, sodium, feldspars, feldspars, make, up, about, 60, of, the, earth, s, crust, and, 41, of, the, earth, s, continental, crust, by, weight, feldspars, crystallize, from, magma, as, both, intrusive, and, extrusive, igneous, rocks, and, are, also, present, in, many, types, of, metamorphic, rock, rock, formed, almost, entirely, of, calcic, plagioclase, feldspar, is, known, as, anorthosite, feldspars, are, also, found, in, many, types, of, sedimentary, rocks, the, feldspar, group, of, minerals, consists, of, tectosilicates, silicate, minerals, in, which, silicon, ions, are, linked, by, shared, oxygen, ions, to, form, a, three, dimensional, network, compositions, of, major, elements, in, common, feldspars, can, be, expressed, in, terms, of, three, endmembers, solid, solutions, between, k, feldspar, and, albite, are, called, alkali, feldspar, solid, solutions, between, albite, and, anorthite, are, called, plagioclase, or, more, properly, plagioclase, feldspar, only, limited, solid, solution, occurs, between, k, feldspar, and, anorthite, and, in, the, two, other, solid, solutions, immiscibility, occurs, at, temperatures, common, in, the, crust, of, the, earth, albite, is, considered, both, a, plagioclase, and, alkali, feldspar, the, ratio, of, alkali, feldspar, to, plagioclase, feldspar, together, with, the, proportion, of, quartz, is, the, basis, for, the, qapf, classification, of, igneous, rock, calcium, rich, plagioclase, is, the, first, feldspar, to, crystallize, from, cooling, magma, but, the, plagioclase, becomes, increasingly, sodium, rich, as, crystallization, continues, this, defines, the, continuous, bowen, s, reaction, series, k, feldspar, is, the, final, feldspar, to, crystallize, from, the, magma, alkali, feldspars, are, grouped, into, two, types, those, containing, potassium, in, combination, with, sodium, aluminium, or, silicon, and, those, where, potassium, is, replaced, by, barium, the, first, of, these, include, potassium, and, sodium, feldspars, are, not, perfectly, miscible, in, the, melt, at, low, temperatures, therefore, intermediate, compositions, of, the, alkali, feldspars, occur, only, in, higher, temperature, environments, sanidine, is, stable, at, the, highest, temperatures, and, microcline, at, the, lowest, perthite, is, a, typical, texture, in, alkali, feldspar, due, to, exsolution, of, contrasting, alkali, feldspar, compositions, during, cooling, of, an, intermediate, composition, the, perthitic, textures, in, the, alkali, feldspars, of, many, granites, can, be, seen, with, the, naked, eye, microperthitic, textures, in, crystals, are, visible, using, a, light, microscope, whereas, cryptoperthitic, textures, can, be, seen, only, with, an, electron, microscope, buddingtonite, is, an, ammonium, feldspar, with, the, chemical, formula, nh, 4, alsi, 3, o, 8, it, is, a, mineral, associated, with, hydrothermal, alteration, of, the, primary, feldspar, minerals, barium, feldspars, form, as, the, result, of, the, substitution, of, barium, for, potassium, in, the, mineral, structure, barium, feldspars, are, sometimes, classified, as, a, separate, group, of, feldspars, and, sometimes, they, are, classified, as, a, sub, group, of, alkali, feldspars, the, barium, feldspars, are, monoclinic, and, include, the, following, the, plagioclase, feldspars, are, triclinic, the, plagioclase, series, follows, with, percent, anorthite, in, parentheses, intermediate, compositions, of, exsolve, to, two, feldspars, of, contrasting, composition, during, cooling, but, diffusion, is, much, slower, than, in, alkali, feldspar, and, the, resulting, two, feldspar, intergrowths, typically, are, too, fine, grained, to, be, visible, with, optical, microscopes, the, immiscibility, gaps, in, the, plagioclase, solid, solutions, are, complex, compared, to, the, gap, in, the, alkali, feldspars, the, play, of, colours, visible, in, some, feldspar, of, labradorite, composition, is, due, to, very, fine, grained, exsolution, lamellae, known, as, b, ggild, intergrowth, the, specific, gravity, in, the, plagioclase, series, increases, from, albite, 2, 62, to, anorthite, 2, 72, 2, 75, the, structure, of, a, feldspar, crystal, is, based, on, aluminosilicate, tetrahedra, each, tetrahedron, consists, of, an, aluminium, or, silicon, ion, surrounded, by, four, oxygen, ions, each, oxygen, ion, in, turn, is, shared, by, a, neighbouring, tetrahedron, to, form, a, three, dimensional, network, the, structure, can, be, visualized, as, long, chains, of, aluminosilicate, tetrahedra, sometimes, described, as, crankshaft, chains, because, their, shape, is, kinked, each, crankshaft, chain, links, to, neighbouring, crankshaft, chains, to, form, a, three, dimensional, network, of, fused, four, member, rings, the, structure, is, open, enough, for, cations, typically, sodium, potassium, or, calcium, to, fit, into, the, structure, and, provide, charge, balance, the, name, feldspar, derives, from, the, german, feldspat, a, compound, of, the, words, feld, field, and, spat, flake, spat, had, long, been, used, as, the, word, for, a, rock, easily, cleaved, into, flakes, feldspat, was, introduced, in, the, 18th, century, as, a, more, specific, term, referring, perhaps, to, its, common, occurrence, in, rocks, found, in, fields, urban, br, ckmann, 1783, or, to, its, occurrence, as, fields, within, granite, and, other, minerals, ren, just, ha, y, 1804, the, change, from, spat, to, spar, was, influenced, by, the, english, word, spar, meaning, a, non, opaque, mineral, with, good, cleavage, feldspathic, refers, to, materials, that, contain, feldspar, the, alternate, spelling, felspar, has, fallen, out, of, use, the, term, felsic, meaning, light, coloured, minerals, such, as, quartz, and, feldspars, is, an, acronymic, word, derived, from, fel, dspar, and, si, lica, unrelated, to, the, obsolete, spelling, felspar, chemical, weathering, of, feldspars, happens, by, hydrolysis, and, produces, clay, minerals, including, illite, smectite, and, kaolinite, hydrolysis, of, feldspars, begins, with, the, feldspar, dissolving, in, water, which, happens, best, in, acidic, or, basic, solutions, and, less, well, in, neutral, ones, the, speed, at, which, feldspars, are, weathered, is, controlled, by, how, quickly, they, are, dissolved, dissolved, feldspar, reacts, with, h, or, oh, ions, and, precipitates, clays, the, reaction, also, produces, new, ions, in, solution, with, the, variety, of, ions, controlled, by, the, type, of, feldspar, reacting, the, abundance, of, feldspars, in, the, earth, s, crust, means, that, clays, are, very, abundant, weathering, products, about, 40, of, minerals, in, sedimentary, rocks, are, clays, and, clays, are, the, dominant, minerals, in, the, most, common, sedimentary, rocks, mudrocks, they, are, also, an, important, component, of, soils, feldspar, that, has, been, replaced, by, clay, looks, chalky, compared, to, more, crystalline, and, glassy, unweathered, feldspar, grains, feldspars, especially, plagioclase, feldspars, are, not, very, stable, at, the, earth, s, surface, due, to, their, high, formation, temperature, this, lack, of, stability, is, why, feldspars, are, easily, weathered, to, clays, because, of, this, tendency, to, weather, easily, feldspars, are, usually, not, prevalent, in, sedimentary, rocks, sedimentary, rocks, that, contain, large, amounts, of, feldspar, indicate, that, the, sediment, did, not, undergo, much, chemical, weathering, before, being, buried, this, means, it, was, probably, transported, a, short, distance, in, cold, and, or, dry, conditions, that, did, not, promote, weathering, and, that, it, was, quickly, buried, by, other, sediment, sandstones, with, large, amounts, of, feldspar, are, called, arkoses, feldspar, is, a, common, raw, material, used, in, glassmaking, ceramics, and, to, some, extent, as, filler, and, an, extender, in, paint, plastics, and, rubber, in, the, us, about, 66, of, feldspar, is, consumed, in, glassmaking, including, glass, containers, and, glass, fibre, ceramics, including, electrical, insulators, sanitaryware, tableware, and, tile, and, other, uses, such, as, fillers, accounted, for, the, remainder, glass, feldspar, provides, both, k, 2, o, and, na, 2, o, for, fluxing, and, al, 2, o, 3, and, cao, as, stabilizers, as, an, important, source, of, al, 2, o, 3, for, glassmaking, feldspar, is, valued, for, its, low, iron, and, refractory, mineral, content, a, low, cost, per, unit, of, al, 2, o, 3, no, volatiles, and, no, waste, ceramics, feldspars, are, used, in, the, ceramic, industry, as, a, flux, to, form, a, glassy, phase, in, bodies, during, firing, and, thus, promote, vitrification, they, also, are, used, as, a, source, of, alkalies, and, alumina, in, glazes, the, composition, of, feldspar, used, in, different, ceramic, formulations, varies, depending, on, various, factors, including, the, properties, of, the, individual, grade, the, other, raw, materials, and, the, requirements, of, the, finished, products, however, typical, additions, include, tableware, 15, to, 30, feldspar, high, tension, electrical, porcelains, 25, to, 35, sanitaryware, 25, wall, tile, 0, to, 10, and, dental, porcelain, up, to, 80, feldspar, earth, sciences, in, earth, sciences, and, archaeology, feldspars, are, used, for, potassium, argon, dating, argon, argon, dating, and, luminescence, dating, minor, use, some, household, cleaners, such, as, bar, keepers, friend, and, bon, ami, use, feldspar, to, give, a, mild, abrasive, action, the, usgs, estimated, global, production, of, feldspar, in, 2020, to, be, 26, million, tonnes, with, the, top, four, producing, countries, being, china, 2, million, tonnes, india, 5, million, tonnes, italy, 4, million, turkey, 7, 6, million, tonnes, typical, mineralogical, and, chemical, analyses, of, three, commercial, grades, used, in, ceramics, are, in, october, 2012, the, curiosity, rover, found, high, feldspar, content, in, a, mars, rock
