in, the, physical, sciences, a, particle, or, corpuscule, in, older, texts, is, a, small, localized, object, which, can, be, described, by, several, physical, or, chemical, properties, such, as, volume, density, or, mass, they, vary, greatly, in, size, or, quantity, from, subatomic, particles, like, the, electron, to, microscopic, particles, like, atoms, and, molecules, to, macroscopic, particles, like, powders, and, other, granular, materials, particles, can, also, be, used, to, create, scientific, models, of, even, larger, objects, depending, on, their, density, such, as, humans, moving, in, a, crowd, or, celestial, bodies, in, motion, the, term, particle, is, rather, general, in, meaning, and, is, refined, as, needed, by, various, scientific, fields, anything, that, is, composed, of, particles, may, be, referred, to, as, being, particulate, however, the, noun, particulate, is, most, frequently, used, to, refer, to, pollutants, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, which, are, a, suspension, of, unconnected, particles, rather, than, a, connected, particle, aggregation, the, concept, of, particles, is, particularly, useful, when, modelling, nature, as, the, full, treatment, of, many, phenomena, can, be, complex, and, also, involve, difficult, computation, it, can, be, used, to, make, simplifying, assumptions, concerning, the, processes, involved, francis, sears, and, mark, zemansky, in, university, physics, give, the, example, of, calculating, the, landing, location, and, speed, of, a, baseball, thrown, in, the, air, they, gradually, strip, the, baseball, of, most, of, its, properties, by, first, idealizing, it, as, a, rigid, smooth, sphere, then, by, neglecting, rotation, buoyancy, and, friction, ultimately, reducing, the, problem, to, the, ballistics, of, a, classical, point, particle, the, treatment, of, large, numbers, of, particles, is, the, realm, of, statistical, physics, the, term, particle, is, usually, applied, differently, to, three, classes, of, sizes, the, term, macroscopic, particle, usually, refers, to, particles, much, larger, than, atoms, and, molecules, these, are, usually, abstracted, as, point, like, particles, even, though, they, have, volumes, shapes, structures, etc, examples, of, macroscopic, particles, would, include, powder, dust, sand, pieces, of, debris, during, a, car, accident, or, even, objects, as, big, as, the, stars, of, a, galaxy, another, type, microscopic, particles, usually, refers, to, particles, of, sizes, ranging, from, atoms, to, molecules, such, as, carbon, dioxide, nanoparticles, and, colloidal, particles, these, particles, are, studied, in, chemistry, as, well, as, atomic, and, molecular, physics, the, smallest, of, particles, are, the, subatomic, particles, which, refer, to, particles, smaller, than, atoms, these, would, include, particles, such, as, the, constituents, of, atoms, protons, neutrons, and, electrons, as, well, as, other, types, of, particles, which, can, only, be, produced, in, particle, accelerators, or, cosmic, rays, these, particles, are, studied, in, particle, physics, because, of, their, extremely, small, size, the, study, of, microscopic, and, subatomic, particles, falls, in, the, realm, of, quantum, mechanics, they, will, exhibit, phenomena, demonstrated, in, the, particle, in, a, box, model, including, wave, particle, duality, and, whether, particles, can, be, considered, distinct, or, identical, is, an, important, question, in, many, situations, particles, can, also, be, classified, according, to, composition, composite, particles, refer, to, particles, that, have, composition, that, is, particles, which, are, made, of, other, particles, for, example, a, carbon, 14, atom, is, made, of, six, protons, eight, neutrons, and, six, electrons, by, contrast, elementary, particles, also, called, fundamental, particles, refer, to, particles, that, are, not, made, of, other, particles, according, to, our, current, understanding, of, the, world, only, a, very, small, number, of, these, exist, such, as, leptons, quarks, and, gluons, however, it, is, possible, that, some, of, these, might, turn, up, to, be, composite, particles, after, all, and, merely, appear, to, be, elementary, for, the, moment, while, composite, particles, can, very, often, be, considered, point, like, elementary, particles, are, truly, punctual, both, elementary, such, as, muons, and, composite, particles, such, as, uranium, nuclei, are, known, to, undergo, particle, decay, those, that, do, not, are, called, stable, particles, such, as, the, electron, or, a, helium, 4, nucleus, the, lifetime, of, stable, particles, can, be, either, infinite, or, large, enough, to, hinder, attempts, to, observe, such, decays, in, the, latter, case, those, particles, are, called, observationally, stable, in, general, a, particle, decays, from, a, high, energy, state, to, a, lower, energy, state, by, emitting, some, form, of, radiation, such, as, the, emission, of, photons, in, computational, physics, n, body, simulations, also, called, n, particle, simulations, are, simulations, of, dynamical, systems, of, particles, under, the, influence, of, certain, conditions, such, as, being, subject, to, gravity, these, simulations, are, very, common, in, cosmology, and, computational, fluid, dynamics, n, refers, to, the, number, of, particles, considered, as, simulations, with, higher, n, are, more, computationally, intensive, systems, with, large, numbers, of, actual, particles, will, often, be, approximated, to, a, smaller, number, of, particles, and, simulation, algorithms, need, to, be, optimized, through, various, methods, colloidal, particles, are, the, components, of, a, colloid, a, colloid, is, a, substance, microscopically, dispersed, evenly, throughout, another, substance, such, colloidal, system, can, be, solid, liquid, or, gaseous, as, well, as, continuous, or, dispersed, the, dispersed, phase, particles, have, a, diameter, of, between, approximately, 5, and, 200, nanometers, soluble, particles, smaller, than, this, will, form, a, solution, as, opposed, to, a, colloid, colloidal, systems, also, called, colloidal, solutions, or, colloidal, suspensions, are, the, subject, of, interface, and, colloid, science, suspended, solids, may, be, held, in, a, liquid, while, solid, or, liquid, particles, suspended, in, a, gas, together, form, an, aerosol, particles, may, also, be, suspended, in, the, form, of, atmospheric, particulate, matter, which, may, constitute, air, pollution, larger, particles, can, similarly, form, marine, debris, or, space, debris, a, conglomeration, of, discrete, solid, macroscopic, particles, may, be, described, as, a, granular, material
