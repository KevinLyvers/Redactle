an, atmosphere, from, ancient, greek, atm, s, vapour, steam, and, spha, ra, sphere, is, a, layer, of, gasses, that, envelop, an, astronomical, object, held, in, place, by, the, gravity, of, the, object, a, planet, retains, an, atmosphere, when, the, gravity, is, great, and, the, temperature, of, the, atmosphere, is, low, a, stellar, atmosphere, is, the, outer, region, of, a, star, which, includes, the, layers, above, the, opaque, photosphere, stars, of, low, temperature, might, have, outer, atmospheres, containing, compound, molecules, the, atmosphere, of, earth, is, composed, of, nitrogen, 78, oxygen, 21, argon, 0, 9, carbon, dioxide, 0, 04, and, trace, gases, most, organisms, use, oxygen, for, respiration, lightning, and, bacteria, perform, nitrogen, fixation, which, produces, ammonia, that, is, used, to, make, nucleotides, and, amino, acids, plants, algae, and, cyanobacteria, use, carbon, dioxide, for, photosynthesis, the, layered, composition, of, the, atmosphere, minimises, the, harmful, effects, of, sunlight, ultraviolet, radiation, solar, wind, and, cosmic, rays, and, thus, protects, the, organisms, from, genetic, damage, the, current, composition, of, the, atmosphere, of, the, earth, is, the, product, of, billions, of, years, of, biochemical, modification, of, the, paleoatmosphere, by, living, organisms, atmospheres, are, clouds, of, gas, bound, to, and, engulfing, an, astronomical, focal, point, of, sufficiently, dominating, mass, adding, to, its, mass, possibly, escaping, from, it, or, collapsing, into, it, because, of, the, latter, such, planetary, nucleus, can, develop, from, interstellar, molecular, clouds, or, protoplanetary, disks, into, rocky, astronomical, objects, with, varyingly, thick, atmospheres, gas, giants, or, fusors, composition, and, thickness, is, originally, determined, by, the, stellar, nebula, s, chemistry, and, temperature, but, can, also, by, a, product, processes, within, the, astronomical, body, outgasing, a, different, atmosphere, the, atmospheres, of, the, planets, venus, and, mars, are, principally, composed, of, carbon, dioxide, and, nitrogen, argon, and, oxygen, the, composition, of, earth, s, atmosphere, is, determined, by, the, by, products, of, the, life, that, it, sustains, dry, air, mixture, of, gases, from, earth, s, atmosphere, contains, 78, 08, nitrogen, 20, 95, oxygen, 0, 93, argon, 0, 04, carbon, dioxide, and, traces, of, hydrogen, helium, and, other, noble, gases, by, volume, but, generally, a, variable, amount, of, water, vapor, is, also, present, on, average, about, 1, at, sea, level, the, low, temperatures, and, higher, gravity, of, the, solar, system, s, giant, planets, jupiter, saturn, uranus, and, neptune, allow, them, more, readily, to, retain, gases, with, low, molecular, masses, these, planets, have, hydrogen, helium, atmospheres, with, trace, amounts, of, more, complex, compounds, two, satellites, of, the, outer, planets, possess, significant, atmospheres, titan, a, moon, of, saturn, and, triton, a, moon, of, neptune, have, atmospheres, mainly, of, nitrogen, when, in, the, part, of, its, orbit, closest, to, the, sun, pluto, has, an, atmosphere, of, nitrogen, and, methane, similar, to, triton, s, but, these, gases, are, frozen, when, it, is, farther, from, the, sun, other, bodies, within, the, solar, system, have, extremely, thin, atmospheres, not, in, equilibrium, these, include, the, moon, sodium, gas, mercury, sodium, gas, europa, oxygen, io, sulfur, and, enceladus, water, vapor, the, first, exoplanet, whose, atmospheric, composition, was, determined, is, hd, 209458b, a, gas, giant, with, a, close, orbit, around, a, star, in, the, constellation, pegasus, its, atmosphere, is, heated, to, temperatures, over, 1, 000, k, and, is, steadily, escaping, into, space, hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and, sulfur, have, been, detected, in, the, planet, s, inflated, atmosphere, the, atmosphere, of, earth, is, composed, of, layers, with, different, properties, such, as, specific, gaseous, composition, temperature, and, pressure, the, troposphere, is, the, lowest, layer, of, the, atmosphere, this, extends, from, the, planetary, surface, to, the, bottom, of, the, stratosphere, the, troposphere, contains, 75, 80, of, the, mass, of, the, atmosphere, and, is, the, atmospheric, layer, wherein, the, weather, occurs, the, height, of, the, troposphere, varies, between, 17, km, at, the, equator, and, 7, 0, km, at, the, poles, the, stratosphere, extends, from, the, top, of, the, troposphere, to, the, bottom, of, the, mesosphere, and, contains, the, ozone, layer, at, an, altitude, between, 15, km, and, 35, km, it, is, the, atmospheric, layer, that, absorbs, most, of, the, ultraviolet, radiation, that, earth, receives, from, the, sun, the, mesosphere, ranges, from, 50, km, to, 85, km, and, is, the, layer, wherein, most, meteors, are, incinerated, before, reaching, the, surface, the, thermosphere, extends, from, an, altitude, of, 85, km, to, the, base, of, the, exosphere, at, 690, km, and, contains, the, ionosphere, where, solar, radiation, ionizes, the, atmosphere, the, density, of, the, ionosphere, is, greater, at, short, distances, from, the, planetary, surface, in, the, daytime, and, decreases, as, the, ionosphere, rises, at, night, time, thereby, allowing, a, greater, range, of, radio, frequencies, to, travel, greater, distances, the, exosphere, begins, at, 690, to, 1, 000, km, from, the, surface, and, extends, to, roughly, 10, 000, km, where, it, interacts, with, the, magnetosphere, of, earth, atmospheric, pressure, is, the, force, per, unit, area, perpendicular, to, a, unit, area, of, planetary, surface, as, determined, by, the, weight, of, the, vertical, column, of, atmospheric, gases, in, said, atmospheric, model, the, atmospheric, pressure, the, weight, of, the, mass, of, the, gas, decreases, at, high, altitude, because, of, the, diminishing, mass, of, the, gas, above, the, point, of, barometric, measurement, the, units, of, air, pressure, are, based, upon, the, standard, atmosphere, atm, which, is, 101, 325, pa, equivalent, to, 760, torr, or, 14, 696, psi, the, height, at, which, the, atmospheric, pressure, declines, by, a, factor, of, e, an, irrational, number, equal, to, 2, 71828, is, called, the, scale, height, h, for, an, atmosphere, of, uniform, temperature, the, scale, height, is, proportional, to, the, atmospheric, temperature, and, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, product, of, the, mean, molecular, mass, of, dry, air, and, the, local, acceleration, of, gravity, at, the, point, of, barometric, measurement, surface, gravity, differs, significantly, among, the, planets, for, example, the, large, gravitational, force, of, the, giant, planet, jupiter, retains, light, gases, such, as, hydrogen, and, helium, that, escape, from, objects, with, lower, gravity, secondly, the, distance, from, the, sun, determines, the, energy, available, to, heat, atmospheric, gas, to, the, point, where, some, fraction, of, its, molecules, thermal, motion, exceed, the, planet, s, escape, velocity, allowing, those, to, escape, a, planet, s, gravitational, grasp, thus, distant, and, cold, titan, triton, and, pluto, are, able, to, retain, their, atmospheres, despite, their, relatively, low, gravities, since, a, collection, of, gas, molecules, may, be, moving, at, a, wide, range, of, velocities, there, will, always, be, some, fast, enough, to, produce, a, slow, leakage, of, gas, into, space, lighter, molecules, move, faster, than, heavier, ones, with, the, same, thermal, kinetic, energy, and, so, gases, of, low, molecular, weight, are, lost, more, rapidly, than, those, of, high, molecular, weight, it, is, thought, that, venus, and, mars, may, have, lost, much, of, their, water, when, after, being, photodissociated, into, hydrogen, and, oxygen, by, solar, ultraviolet, radiation, the, hydrogen, escaped, earth, s, magnetic, field, helps, to, prevent, this, as, normally, the, solar, wind, would, greatly, enhance, the, escape, of, hydrogen, however, over, the, past, 3, billion, years, earth, may, have, lost, gases, through, the, magnetic, polar, regions, due, to, auroral, activity, including, a, net, 2, of, its, atmospheric, oxygen, the, net, effect, taking, the, most, important, escape, processes, into, account, is, that, an, intrinsic, magnetic, field, does, not, protect, a, planet, from, atmospheric, escape, and, that, for, some, magnetizations, the, presence, of, a, magnetic, field, works, to, increase, the, escape, rate, other, mechanisms, that, can, cause, atmosphere, depletion, are, solar, wind, induced, sputtering, impact, erosion, weathering, and, sequestration, sometimes, referred, to, as, freezing, out, into, the, regolith, and, polar, caps, atmospheres, have, dramatic, effects, on, the, surfaces, of, rocky, bodies, objects, that, have, no, atmosphere, or, that, have, only, an, exosphere, have, terrain, that, is, covered, in, craters, without, an, atmosphere, the, planet, has, no, protection, from, meteoroids, and, all, of, them, collide, with, the, surface, as, meteorites, and, create, craters, for, planets, with, a, significant, atmosphere, most, meteoroids, burn, up, as, meteors, before, hitting, a, planet, s, surface, when, meteoroids, do, impact, the, effects, are, often, erased, by, the, action, of, wind, wind, erosion, is, a, significant, factor, in, shaping, the, terrain, of, rocky, planets, with, atmospheres, and, over, time, can, erase, the, effects, of, both, craters, and, volcanoes, in, addition, since, liquids, cannot, exist, without, pressure, an, atmosphere, allows, liquid, to, be, present, at, the, surface, resulting, in, lakes, rivers, and, oceans, earth, and, titan, are, known, to, have, liquids, at, their, surface, and, terrain, on, the, planet, suggests, that, mars, had, liquid, on, its, surface, in, the, past, the, circulation, of, the, atmosphere, occurs, due, to, thermal, differences, when, convection, becomes, a, more, efficient, transporter, of, heat, than, thermal, radiation, on, planets, where, the, primary, heat, source, is, solar, radiation, excess, heat, in, the, tropics, is, transported, to, higher, latitudes, when, a, planet, generates, a, significant, amount, of, heat, internally, such, as, is, the, case, for, jupiter, convection, in, the, atmosphere, can, transport, thermal, energy, from, the, higher, temperature, interior, up, to, the, surface, from, the, perspective, of, a, planetary, geologist, the, atmosphere, acts, to, shape, a, planetary, surface, wind, picks, up, dust, and, other, particles, which, when, they, collide, with, the, terrain, erode, the, relief, and, leave, deposits, eolian, processes, frost, and, precipitations, which, depend, on, the, atmospheric, composition, also, influence, the, relief, climate, changes, can, influence, a, planet, s, geological, history, conversely, studying, the, surface, of, the, earth, leads, to, an, understanding, of, the, atmosphere, and, climate, of, other, planets, for, a, meteorologist, the, composition, of, the, earth, s, atmosphere, is, a, factor, affecting, the, climate, and, its, variations, for, a, biologist, or, paleontologist, the, earth, s, atmospheric, composition, is, closely, dependent, on, the, appearance, of, life, and, its, evolution
