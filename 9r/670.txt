the, geologic, time, scale, or, geological, time, scale, gts, is, a, representation, of, time, based, on, the, rock, record, of, earth, it, is, a, system, of, chronological, dating, that, uses, chronostratigraphy, the, process, of, relating, strata, to, time, and, geochronology, a, scientific, branch, of, geology, that, aims, to, determine, the, age, of, rocks, it, is, used, primarily, by, earth, scientists, including, geologists, paleontologists, geophysicists, geochemists, and, paleoclimatologists, to, describe, the, timing, and, relationships, of, events, in, geologic, history, the, time, scale, has, been, developed, through, the, study, of, rock, layers, and, the, observation, of, their, relationships, and, identifying, features, such, as, lithologies, paleomagnetic, properties, and, fossils, the, definition, of, standardised, international, units, of, geologic, time, is, the, responsibility, of, the, international, commission, on, stratigraphy, ics, a, constituent, body, of, the, international, union, of, geological, sciences, iugs, whose, primary, objective, is, to, precisely, define, global, chronostratigraphic, units, of, the, international, chronostratigraphic, chart, icc, that, are, used, to, define, divisions, of, geologic, time, the, chronostratigraphic, divisions, are, in, turn, used, to, define, geochronologic, units, while, some, regional, terms, are, still, in, use, the, table, of, geologic, time, conforms, to, the, nomenclature, ages, and, colour, codes, set, forth, by, the, ics, the, geologic, time, scale, is, a, way, of, representing, deep, time, based, on, events, that, have, occurred, throughout, earth, s, history, a, time, span, of, about, 4, 54, 0, 05, ga, 4, 54, billion, years, it, chronologically, organises, strata, and, subsequently, time, by, observing, fundamental, changes, in, stratigraphy, that, correspond, to, major, geological, or, paleontological, events, for, example, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, marks, the, lower, boundary, of, the, paleogene, system, period, and, thus, the, boundary, between, the, cretaceous, and, paleogene, systems, periods, for, divisions, prior, to, the, cryogenian, arbitrary, numeric, boundary, definitions, global, standard, stratigraphic, ages, gssas, are, used, to, divide, geologic, time, proposals, have, been, made, to, better, reconcile, these, divisions, with, the, rock, record, historically, regional, geologic, time, scales, were, used, due, to, the, litho, and, biostratigraphic, differences, around, the, world, in, time, equivalent, rocks, the, ics, has, long, worked, to, reconcile, conflicting, terminology, by, standardising, globally, significant, and, identifiable, stratigraphic, horizons, that, can, be, used, to, define, the, lower, boundaries, of, chronostratigraphic, units, defining, chronostratigraphic, units, in, such, a, manner, allows, for, the, use, of, global, standardised, nomenclature, the, icc, represents, this, ongoing, effort, the, relative, relationships, of, rocks, for, determining, their, chronostratigraphic, positions, use, the, overriding, principles, of, the, gts, is, divided, into, chronostratigraphic, units, and, their, corresponding, geochronologic, units, these, are, represented, on, the, icc, published, by, the, ics, however, regional, terms, are, still, in, use, in, some, areas, chronostratigraphy, is, the, element, of, stratigraphy, that, deals, with, the, relation, between, rock, bodies, and, the, relative, measurement, of, geological, time, it, is, the, process, where, distinct, strata, between, defined, stratigraphic, horizons, are, assigned, to, represent, a, relative, interval, of, geologic, time, a, chronostratigraphic, unit, is, a, body, of, rock, layered, or, unlayered, that, is, defined, between, specified, stratigraphic, horizons, which, represent, specified, intervals, of, geologic, time, they, include, all, rocks, representative, of, a, specific, interval, of, geologic, time, and, only, this, time, span, eonothem, erathem, system, series, subseries, stage, and, substage, are, the, hierarchical, chronostratigraphic, units, geochronology, is, the, scientific, branch, of, geology, that, aims, to, determine, the, age, of, rocks, fossils, and, sediments, either, through, absolute, e, g, radiometric, dating, or, relative, means, e, g, stratigraphic, position, paleomagnetism, stable, isotope, ratios, a, geochronologic, unit, is, a, subdivision, of, geologic, time, it, is, a, numeric, representation, of, an, intangible, property, time, eon, era, period, epoch, subepoch, age, and, subage, are, the, hierarchical, geochronologic, units, geochronometry, is, the, field, of, geochronology, that, numerically, quantifies, geologic, time, a, global, boundary, stratotype, section, and, point, gssp, is, an, internationally, agreed, upon, reference, point, on, a, stratigraphic, section, which, defines, the, lower, boundaries, of, stages, on, the, geologic, time, scale, recently, this, has, been, used, to, define, the, base, of, a, system, a, global, standard, stratigraphic, age, gssa, is, a, numeric, only, chronologic, reference, point, used, to, define, the, base, of, geochronologic, units, prior, to, the, cryogenian, these, points, are, arbitrarily, defined, they, are, used, where, gssps, have, not, yet, been, established, research, is, ongoing, to, define, gssps, for, the, base, of, all, units, that, are, currently, defined, by, gssas, the, numeric, geochronometric, representation, of, a, geochronologic, unit, can, and, is, more, often, subject, to, change, when, geochronology, refines, the, geochronometry, while, the, equivalent, chronostratigraphic, unit, remains, the, same, and, their, revision, is, less, common, for, example, in, early, 2022, the, boundary, between, the, ediacaran, and, cambrian, periods, geochronologic, units, was, revised, from, 541, ma, to, 538, 8, ma, but, the, rock, definition, of, the, boundary, gssp, at, the, base, of, the, cambrian, and, thus, the, boundary, between, the, ediacaran, and, cambrian, systems, chronostratigraphic, units, has, not, changed, merely, the, geochronometry, has, been, refined, the, numeric, values, on, the, icc, are, represented, by, the, unit, ma, megaannum, for, million, years, for, example, 201, 4, 0, 2, ma, the, lower, boundary, of, the, jurassic, period, is, defined, as, 201, 400, 000, years, old, with, an, uncertainty, of, 200, 000, years, other, si, prefix, units, commonly, used, by, geologists, are, ga, gigaannum, billion, years, and, ka, kiloannum, thousand, years, with, the, latter, often, represented, in, calibrated, units, before, present, the, early, and, late, subdivisions, are, used, as, the, geochronologic, equivalents, of, the, chronostratigraphic, lower, and, upper, e, g, early, triassic, period, geochronologic, unit, is, used, in, place, of, lower, triassic, series, chronostratigraphic, unit, rocks, representing, a, given, chronostratigraphic, unit, are, that, chronostratigraphic, unit, and, the, time, they, were, laid, down, in, is, the, geochronologic, unit, i, e, the, rocks, that, represent, the, silurian, series, are, the, silurian, series, and, they, were, deposited, during, the, silurian, period, the, names, of, geologic, time, units, are, defined, for, chronostratigraphic, units, with, the, corresponding, geochronologic, unit, sharing, the, same, name, with, a, change, to, the, latter, e, g, phanerozoic, eonothem, becomes, the, phanerozoic, eon, names, of, erathems, in, the, phanerozoic, were, chosen, to, reflect, major, changes, in, the, history, of, life, on, earth, paleozoic, old, life, mesozoic, middle, life, and, cenozoic, new, life, names, of, systems, are, diverse, in, origin, with, some, indicating, chronologic, position, e, g, paleogene, while, others, are, named, for, lithology, e, g, cretaceous, geography, e, g, permian, or, are, tribal, e, g, ordovician, in, origin, most, currently, recognised, series, and, subseries, are, named, for, their, position, within, a, system, series, early, middle, late, however, the, ics, advocates, for, all, new, series, and, subseries, to, be, named, for, a, geographic, feature, in, the, vicinity, of, its, stratotype, or, type, locality, the, name, of, stages, should, also, be, derived, from, a, geographic, feature, in, the, locality, of, its, stratotype, or, type, locality, informally, the, time, before, the, cambrian, is, often, referred, to, as, the, precambrian, or, pre, cambrian, supereon, while, a, modern, geological, time, scale, was, not, formulated, until, 1911, by, arthur, holmes, the, broader, concept, that, rocks, and, time, are, related, can, be, traced, back, to, at, least, the, philosophers, of, ancient, greece, xenophanes, of, colophon, c, 570, 487, bce, observed, rock, beds, with, fossils, of, shells, located, above, the, sea, level, viewed, them, as, once, living, organisms, and, used, this, to, imply, an, unstable, relationship, in, which, the, sea, had, at, times, transgressed, over, the, land, and, at, other, times, had, regressed, this, view, was, shared, by, a, few, of, xenophanes, contemporaries, and, those, that, followed, including, aristotle, 384, 322, bce, who, with, additional, observations, reasoned, that, the, positions, of, land, and, sea, had, changed, over, long, periods, of, time, the, concept, of, deep, time, was, also, recognised, by, chinese, naturalist, shen, kuo, 1031, 1095, and, islamic, scientist, philosophers, notably, the, brothers, of, purity, who, wrote, on, the, processes, of, stratification, over, the, passage, of, time, in, their, treatises, their, work, likely, inspired, that, of, the, 11th, century, persian, polymath, avicenna, ibn, s, n, 980, 1037, who, wrote, in, the, book, of, healing, 1027, on, the, concept, of, stratification, and, superposition, pre, dating, nicolas, steno, by, more, than, six, centuries, avicenna, also, recognised, fossils, as, petrifications, of, the, bodies, of, plants, and, animals, with, the, 13th, century, dominican, bishop, albertus, magnus, c, 1200, 1280, extending, this, into, a, theory, of, a, petrifying, fluid, these, works, appeared, to, have, little, influence, on, scholars, in, medieval, europe, who, looked, to, the, bible, to, explain, the, origins, of, fossils, and, sea, level, changes, often, attributing, these, to, the, deluge, including, ristoro, d, arezzo, in, 1282, it, was, not, until, the, italian, renaissance, when, leonardo, da, vinci, 1452, 1519, would, reinvigorate, the, relationships, between, stratification, relative, sea, level, change, and, time, denouncing, attribution, of, fossils, to, the, deluge, of, the, stupidity, and, ignorance, of, those, who, imagine, that, these, creatures, were, carried, to, such, places, distant, from, the, sea, by, the, deluge, why, do, we, find, so, many, fragments, and, whole, shells, between, the, different, layers, of, stone, unless, they, had, been, upon, the, shore, and, had, been, covered, over, by, earth, newly, thrown, up, by, the, sea, which, then, became, petrified, and, if, the, above, mentioned, deluge, had, carried, them, to, these, places, from, the, sea, you, would, find, the, shells, at, the, edge, of, one, layer, of, rock, only, not, at, the, edge, of, many, where, may, be, counted, the, winters, of, the, years, during, which, the, sea, multiplied, the, layers, of, sand, and, mud, brought, down, by, the, neighboring, rivers, and, spread, them, over, its, shores, and, if, you, wish, to, say, that, there, must, have, been, many, deluges, in, order, to, produce, these, layers, and, the, shells, among, them, it, would, then, become, necessary, for, you, to, affirm, that, such, a, deluge, took, place, every, year, these, views, of, da, vinci, remained, unpublished, and, thus, lacked, influence, at, the, time, however, questions, of, fossils, and, their, significance, were, pursued, and, while, views, against, genesis, were, not, readily, accepted, and, dissent, from, religious, doctrine, was, in, some, places, unwise, scholars, such, as, girolamo, fracastoro, shared, da, vinci, s, views, and, found, the, attribution, of, fossils, to, the, deluge, absurd, niels, stensen, more, commonly, known, as, nicolas, steno, 1638, 1686, is, credited, with, establishing, four, of, the, guiding, principles, of, stratigraphy, in, de, solido, intra, solidum, naturaliter, contento, dissertationis, prodromus, steno, states, respectively, these, are, the, principles, of, superposition, original, horizontality, lateral, continuity, and, cross, cutting, relationships, from, this, steno, reasoned, that, strata, were, laid, down, in, succession, and, inferred, relative, time, in, steno, s, belief, time, from, creation, while, steno, s, principles, were, simple, and, attracted, much, attention, applying, them, proved, challenging, these, basic, principles, albeit, with, improved, and, more, nuanced, interpretations, still, form, the, foundational, principles, of, determining, the, correlation, of, strata, relative, to, geologic, time, over, the, course, of, the, 18th, century, geologists, realised, that, the, apparent, earliest, formal, division, of, the, geologic, record, with, respect, to, time, was, introduced, by, thomas, burnet, who, applied, a, two, fold, terminology, to, mountains, by, identifying, montes, primarii, for, rock, formed, at, the, time, of, the, deluge, and, younger, monticulos, secundarios, formed, later, from, the, debris, of, the, primarii, this, attribution, to, the, deluge, while, questioned, earlier, by, the, likes, of, da, vinci, was, the, foundation, of, abraham, gottlob, werner, s, 1749, 1817, neptunism, theory, in, which, all, rocks, precipitated, out, of, a, single, flood, a, competing, theory, plutonism, was, developed, by, anton, moro, 1687, 1784, and, also, used, primary, and, secondary, divisions, for, rock, units, in, this, early, version, of, the, plutonism, theory, the, interior, of, earth, was, seen, as, hot, and, this, drove, the, creation, of, primary, igneous, and, metamorphic, rocks, and, secondary, rocks, formed, contorted, and, fossiliferous, sediments, these, primary, and, secondary, divisions, were, expanded, on, by, giovanni, targioni, tozzetti, 1712, 1783, and, giovanni, arduino, 1713, 1795, to, include, tertiary, and, quaternary, divisions, these, divisions, were, used, to, describe, both, the, time, during, which, the, rocks, were, laid, down, and, the, collection, of, rocks, themselves, i, e, it, was, correct, to, say, tertiary, rocks, and, tertiary, period, only, the, quaternary, division, is, retained, in, the, modern, geologic, time, scale, while, the, tertiary, division, was, in, use, until, the, early, 21st, century, the, neptunism, and, plutonism, theories, would, compete, into, the, early, 19th, century, with, a, key, driver, for, resolution, of, this, debate, being, the, work, of, james, hutton, 1726, 1797, in, particular, his, theory, of, the, earth, first, presented, before, the, royal, society, of, edinburgh, in, 1785, hutton, s, theory, would, later, become, known, as, uniformitarianism, popularised, by, john, playfair, 1748, 1819, and, later, charles, lyell, 1797, 1875, in, his, principles, of, geology, their, theories, strongly, contested, the, 6, 000, year, age, of, the, earth, as, suggested, determined, by, james, ussher, via, biblical, chronology, that, was, accepted, at, the, time, by, western, religion, instead, using, geological, evidence, they, contested, earth, to, be, much, older, cementing, the, concept, of, deep, time, during, the, early, 19th, century, william, smith, georges, cuvier, jean, d, omalius, d, halloy, and, alexandre, brongniart, pioneered, the, systematic, division, of, rocks, by, stratigraphy, and, fossil, assemblages, these, geologists, began, to, use, the, local, names, given, to, rock, units, in, a, wider, sense, correlating, strata, across, national, and, continental, boundaries, based, on, their, similarity, to, each, other, many, of, the, names, below, erathem, era, rank, in, use, on, the, modern, icc, gts, were, determined, during, the, early, to, mid, 19th, century, during, the, 19th, century, the, debate, regarding, earth, s, age, was, renewed, with, geologists, estimating, ages, based, on, denudation, rates, and, sedimentary, thicknesses, or, ocean, chemistry, and, physicists, determining, ages, for, the, cooling, of, the, earth, or, the, sun, using, basic, thermodynamics, or, orbital, physics, these, estimations, varied, from, 15, 000, million, years, to, 0, 075, million, years, depending, on, method, and, author, but, the, estimations, of, lord, kelvin, and, clarence, king, were, held, in, high, regard, at, the, time, due, to, their, pre, eminence, in, physics, and, geology, all, of, these, early, geochronometric, determinations, would, later, prove, to, be, incorrect, the, discovery, of, radioactive, decay, by, henri, becquerel, marie, curie, and, pierre, curie, laid, the, ground, work, for, radiometric, dating, but, the, knowledge, and, tools, required, for, accurate, determination, of, radiometric, ages, would, not, be, in, place, until, the, mid, 1950s, early, attempts, at, determining, ages, of, uranium, minerals, and, rocks, by, ernest, rutherford, bertram, boltwood, robert, strutt, and, arthur, holmes, would, culminate, in, what, are, considered, the, first, international, geological, time, scales, by, holmes, in, 1911, and, 1913, the, discovery, of, isotopes, in, 1913, by, frederick, soddy, and, the, developments, in, mass, spectrometry, pioneered, by, francis, william, aston, arthur, jeffrey, dempster, and, alfred, o, c, nier, during, the, early, to, mid, 20th, century, would, finally, allow, for, the, accurate, determination, of, radiometric, ages, with, holmes, publishing, several, revisions, to, his, geological, time, scale, with, his, final, version, in, 1960, the, establishment, of, the, iugs, in, 1961, and, acceptance, of, the, commission, on, stratigraphy, applied, in, 1965, to, become, a, member, commission, of, iugs, led, to, the, founding, of, the, ics, one, of, the, primary, objectives, of, the, ics, is, the, establishment, publication, and, revision, of, the, ics, international, chronostratigraphic, chart, which, is, the, standard, reference, global, geological, time, scale, to, include, the, ratified, commission, decisions, following, on, from, holmes, several, a, geological, time, scale, books, were, published, in, 1982, 1989, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, and, 2020, however, since, 2013, the, ics, has, taken, responsibility, for, producing, and,

many, conditions, and, processes, on, earth, are, profoundly, altered, by, human, impact, as, of, april, 2022, the, anthropocene, has, not, been, ratified, by, the, ics, however, in, may, 2019, the, anthropocene, working, group, voted, in, favour, of, submitting, a, formal, proposal, to, the, ics, for, the, establishment, of, the, anthropocene, series, epoch, nevertheless, the, definition, of, the, anthropocene, as, a, geologic, time, period, rather, than, a, geologic, event, remains, controversial, and, difficult, an, international, working, group, of, the, ics, on, pre, cryogenian,
