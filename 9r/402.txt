https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanthanum
lanthanum, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, la, and, atomic, number, 57, it, is, a, soft, ductile, silvery, white, metal, that, tarnishes, slowly, when, exposed, to, air, it, is, the, eponym, of, the, lanthanide, series, a, group, of, 15, similar, elements, between, lanthanum, and, lutetium, in, the, periodic, table, of, which, lanthanum, is, the, first, and, the, prototype, lanthanum, is, traditionally, counted, among, the, rare, earth, elements, like, most, other, rare, earth, elements, its, usual, oxidation, state, is, 3, although, some, compounds, are, known, with, an, oxidation, state, of, 2, lanthanum, has, no, biological, role, in, humans, but, is, essential, to, some, bacteria, it, is, not, particularly, toxic, to, humans, but, does, show, some, antimicrobial, activity, lanthanum, usually, occurs, together, with, cerium, and, the, other, rare, earth, elements, lanthanum, was, first, found, by, the, swedish, chemist, carl, gustaf, mosander, in, 1839, as, an, impurity, in, cerium, nitrate, hence, the, name, lanthanum, from, the, ancient, greek, lanthanein, meaning, to, lie, hidden, although, it, is, classified, as, a, rare, earth, element, lanthanum, is, the, 28th, most, abundant, element, in, the, earth, s, crust, almost, three, times, as, abundant, as, lead, in, minerals, such, as, monazite, and, bastn, site, lanthanum, composes, about, a, quarter, of, the, lanthanide, content, it, is, extracted, from, those, minerals, by, a, process, of, such, complexity, that, pure, lanthanum, metal, was, not, isolated, until, 1923, lanthanum, compounds, have, numerous, applications, including, catalysts, additives, in, glass, carbon, arc, lamps, for, studio, lights, and, projectors, ignition, elements, in, lighters, and, torches, electron, cathodes, scintillators, and, gas, tungsten, arc, welding, electrodes, lanthanum, carbonate, is, used, as, a, phosphate, binder, to, treat, high, levels, of, phosphate, in, the, blood, accompanied, by, kidney, failure, lanthanum, is, the, first, element, and, prototype, of, the, lanthanide, series, in, the, periodic, table, it, appears, to, the, right, of, the, alkaline, earth, metal, barium, and, to, the, left, of, the, lanthanide, cerium, lanthanum, is, generally, considered, the, first, of, the, f, block, elements, by, authors, writing, on, the, subject, the, 57, electrons, of, a, lanthanum, atom, are, arranged, in, the, configuration, 5d, 1, 6s, 2, with, three, valence, electrons, outside, the, noble, gas, core, in, chemical, reactions, lanthanum, almost, always, gives, up, these, three, valence, electrons, from, the, 5d, and, 6s, subshells, to, form, the, 3, oxidation, state, achieving, the, stable, configuration, of, the, preceding, noble, gas, xenon, some, lanthanum, ii, compounds, are, also, known, but, they, are, usually, much, less, stable, lanthanum, monoxide, lao, produces, strong, absorption, bands, in, some, stellar, spectra, among, the, lanthanides, lanthanum, is, exceptional, as, it, has, no, 4f, electrons, as, a, single, gas, phase, atom, thus, it, is, only, very, weakly, paramagnetic, unlike, the, strongly, paramagnetic, later, lanthanides, with, the, exceptions, of, the, last, two, ytterbium, and, lutetium, where, the, 4f, shell, is, completely, full, however, the, 4f, shell, of, lanthanum, can, become, partially, occupied, in, chemical, environments, and, participate, in, chemical, bonding, for, example, the, melting, points, of, the, trivalent, lanthanides, all, but, europium, and, ytterbium, are, related, to, the, extent, of, hybridisation, of, the, 6s, 5d, and, 4f, electrons, lowering, with, increasing, 4f, involvement, and, lanthanum, has, the, second, lowest, melting, point, among, them, 920, c, europium, and, ytterbium, have, lower, melting, points, because, they, delocalise, about, two, electrons, per, atom, rather, than, three, this, chemical, availability, of, f, orbitals, justifies, lanthanum, s, placement, in, the, f, block, despite, its, anomalous, ground, state, configuration, which, is, merely, the, result, of, strong, interelectronic, repulsion, making, it, less, profitable, to, occupy, the, 4f, shell, as, it, is, small, and, close, to, the, core, electrons, the, lanthanides, become, harder, as, the, series, is, traversed, as, expected, lanthanum, is, a, soft, metal, lanthanum, has, a, relatively, high, resistivity, of, 615, n, m, at, room, temperature, in, comparison, the, value, for, the, good, conductor, aluminium, is, only, 26, 50, n, m, lanthanum, is, the, least, volatile, of, the, lanthanides, like, most, of, the, lanthanides, lanthanum, has, a, hexagonal, crystal, structure, at, room, temperature, la, at, 310, c, lanthanum, changes, to, a, face, centered, cubic, structure, la, and, at, 865, c, it, changes, to, a, body, centered, cubic, structure, la, as, expected, from, periodic, trends, lanthanum, has, the, largest, atomic, radius, of, the, lanthanides, hence, it, is, the, most, reactive, among, them, tarnishing, quite, rapidly, in, air, turning, completely, dark, after, several, hours, and, can, readily, burn, to, form, lanthanum, iii, oxide, la, 2, o, 3, which, is, almost, as, basic, as, calcium, oxide, a, centimeter, sized, sample, of, lanthanum, will, corrode, completely, in, a, year, as, its, oxide, spalls, off, like, iron, rust, instead, of, forming, a, protective, oxide, coating, like, aluminium, scandium, yttrium, and, lutetium, lanthanum, reacts, with, the, halogens, at, room, temperature, to, form, the, trihalides, and, upon, warming, will, form, binary, compounds, with, the, nonmetals, nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, phosphorus, boron, selenium, silicon, and, arsenic, lanthanum, reacts, slowly, with, water, to, form, lanthanum, iii, hydroxide, la, oh, 3, in, dilute, sulfuric, acid, lanthanum, readily, forms, the, aquated, tripositive, ion, 3, this, is, colorless, in, aqueous, solution, since, la, 3, has, no, d, or, f, electrons, lanthanum, is, the, strongest, and, hardest, base, among, the, rare, earth, elements, which, is, again, expected, from, its, being, the, largest, of, them, some, lanthanum, ii, compounds, are, also, known, but, they, are, much, less, stable, therefore, in, officially, naming, compounds, of, lanthanum, its, oxidation, number, always, is, to, be, mentioned, naturally, occurring, lanthanum, is, made, up, of, two, isotopes, the, stable, 139, la, and, the, primordial, long, lived, radioisotope, 138, la, 139, la, is, by, far, the, most, abundant, making, up, 99, 910, of, natural, lanthanum, it, is, produced, in, the, s, process, slow, neutron, capture, which, occurs, in, low, to, medium, mass, stars, and, the, r, process, rapid, neutron, capture, which, occurs, in, core, collapse, supernovae, it, is, the, only, stable, isotope, of, lanthanum, the, very, rare, isotope, 138, la, is, one, of, the, few, primordial, odd, odd, nuclei, with, a, long, half, life, of, 1, 05, 10, 11, years, it, is, one, of, the, proton, rich, p, nuclei, which, cannot, be, produced, in, the, s, or, r, processes, 138, la, along, with, the, even, rarer, 180m, ta, is, produced, in, the, process, where, neutrinos, interact, with, stable, nuclei, all, other, lanthanum, isotopes, are, synthetic, with, the, exception, of, 137, la, with, a, half, life, of, about, 60, 000, years, all, of, them, have, half, lives, less, than, two, days, and, most, have, half, lives, less, than, a, minute, the, isotopes, 139, la, and, 140, la, occur, as, fission, products, of, uranium, lanthanum, oxide, is, a, white, solid, that, can, be, prepared, by, direct, reaction, of, its, constituent, elements, due, to, the, large, size, of, the, la, 3, ion, la, 2, o, 3, adopts, a, hexagonal, 7, coordinate, structure, that, changes, to, the, 6, coordinate, structure, of, scandium, oxide, sc, 2, o, 3, and, yttrium, oxide, y, 2, o, 3, at, high, temperature, when, it, reacts, with, water, lanthanum, hydroxide, is, formed, a, lot, of, heat, is, evolved, in, the, reaction, and, a, hissing, sound, is, heard, lanthanum, hydroxide, will, react, with, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, to, form, the, basic, carbonate, lanthanum, fluoride, is, insoluble, in, water, and, can, be, used, as, a, qualitative, test, for, the, presence, of, la, 3, the, heavier, halides, are, all, very, soluble, deliquescent, compounds, the, anhydrous, halides, are, produced, by, direct, reaction, of, their, elements, as, heating, the, hydrates, causes, hydrolysis, for, example, heating, hydrated, lacl, 3, produces, laocl, lanthanum, reacts, exothermically, with, hydrogen, to, produce, the, dihydride, lah, 2, a, black, pyrophoric, brittle, conducting, compound, with, the, calcium, fluoride, structure, this, is, a, non, stoichiometric, compound, and, further, absorption, of, hydrogen, is, possible, with, a, concomitant, loss, of, electrical, conductivity, until, the, more, salt, like, lah, 3, is, reached, like, lai, 2, and, lai, lah, 2, is, probably, an, electride, compound, due, to, the, large, ionic, radius, and, great, electropositivity, of, la, 3, there, is, not, much, covalent, contribution, to, its, bonding, and, hence, it, has, a, limited, coordination, chemistry, like, yttrium, and, the, other, lanthanides, lanthanum, oxalate, does, not, dissolve, very, much, in, alkali, metal, oxalate, solutions, and, decomposes, around, 500, c, oxygen, is, the, most, common, donor, atom, in, lanthanum, complexes, which, are, mostly, ionic, and, often, have, high, coordination, numbers, over, 6, 8, is, the, most, characteristic, forming, square, antiprismatic, and, dodecadeltahedral, structures, these, high, coordinate, species, reaching, up, to, coordination, number, 12, with, the, use, of, chelating, ligands, such, as, in, la, 2, so, 4, 3, 9, h, 2, o, often, have, a, low, degree, of, symmetry, because, of, stereo, chemical, factors, lanthanum, chemistry, tends, not, to, involve, bonding, due, to, the, electron, configuration, of, the, element, thus, its, organometallic, chemistry, is, quite, limited, the, best, characterized, organolanthanum, compounds, are, the, cyclopentadienyl, complex, la, c, 5, h, 5, 3, which, is, produced, by, reacting, anhydrous, lacl, 3, with, nac, 5, h, 5, in, tetrahydrofuran, and, its, methyl, substituted, derivatives, in, 1751, the, swedish, mineralogist, axel, fredrik, cronstedt, discovered, a, heavy, mineral, from, the, mine, at, bastn, s, later, named, cerite, thirty, years, later, the, fifteen, year, old, wilhelm, hisinger, from, the, family, owning, the, mine, sent, a, sample, of, it, to, carl, scheele, who, did, not, find, any, new, elements, within, in, 1803, after, hisinger, had, become, an, ironmaster, he, returned, to, the, mineral, with, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, and, isolated, a, new, oxide, which, they, named, ceria, after, the, dwarf, planet, ceres, which, had, been, discovered, two, years, earlier, ceria, was, simultaneously, independently, isolated, in, germany, by, martin, heinrich, klaproth, between, 1839, and, 1843, ceria, was, shown, to, be, a, mixture, of, oxides, by, the, swedish, surgeon, and, chemist, carl, gustaf, mosander, who, lived, in, the, same, house, as, berzelius, and, studied, under, him, he, separated, out, two, other, oxides, which, he, named, lanthana, and, didymia, he, partially, decomposed, a, sample, of, cerium, nitrate, by, roasting, it, in, air, and, then, treating, the, resulting, oxide, with, dilute, nitric, acid, that, same, year, axel, erdmann, a, student, also, at, the, karolinska, institute, discovered, lanthanum, in, a, new, mineral, from, l, ven, island, located, in, a, norwegian, fjord, finally, mosander, explained, his, delay, saying, that, he, had, extracted, a, second, element, from, cerium, and, this, he, called, didymium, although, he, did, not, realise, it, didymium, too, was, a, mixture, and, in, 1885, it, was, separated, into, praseodymium, and, neodymium, since, lanthanum, s, properties, differed, only, slightly, from, those, of, cerium, and, occurred, along, with, it, in, its, salts, he, named, it, from, the, ancient, greek, lit, to, lie, hidden, relatively, pure, lanthanum, metal, was, first, isolated, in, 1923, lanthanum, makes, up, 39, mg, kg, of, the, earth, s, crust, behind, neodymium, at, 41, 5, mg, kg, and, cerium, at, 66, 5, mg, kg, despite, being, among, the, so, called, rare, earth, metals, lanthanum, is, thus, not, rare, at, all, but, it, is, historically, so, named, because, it, is, rarer, than, common, earths, such, as, lime, and, magnesia, and, at, the, time, it, was, recognized, only, a, few, deposits, were, known, lanthanum, is, also, ruefully, considered, a, rare, earth, metal, because, the, process, to, mine, it, is, difficult, time, consuming, and, expensive, lanthanum, is, rarely, the, dominant, lanthanide, found, in, the, rare, earth, minerals, and, in, their, chemical, formulae, it, is, usually, preceded, by, cerium, rare, examples, of, la, dominant, minerals, are, monazite, la, and, lanthanite, la, the, la, 3, ion, is, similarly, sized, to, the, early, lanthanides, of, the, cerium, group, those, up, to, samarium, and, europium, that, immediately, follow, in, the, periodic, table, and, hence, it, tends, to, occur, along, with, them, in, phosphate, silicate, and, carbonate, minerals, such, as, monazite, m, iii, po, 4, and, bastn, site, m, iii, co, 3, f, where, m, refers, to, all, the, rare, earth, metals, except, scandium, and, the, radioactive, promethium, mostly, ce, la, and, y, bastn, site, is, usually, lacking, in, thorium, and, the, heavy, lanthanides, and, the, purification, of, the, light, lanthanides, from, it, is, less, involved, the, ore, after, being, crushed, and, ground, is, first, treated, with, hot, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, evolving, carbon, dioxide, hydrogen, fluoride, and, silicon, tetrafluoride, the, product, is, then, dried, and, leached, with, water, leaving, the, early, lanthanide, ions, including, lanthanum, in, solution, the, procedure, for, monazite, which, usually, contains, all, the, rare, earths, as, well, as, thorium, is, more, involved, monazite, because, of, its, magnetic, properties, can, be, separated, by, repeated, electromagnetic, separation, after, separation, it, is, treated, with, hot, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, to, produce, water, soluble, sulfates, of, rare, earths, the, acidic, filtrates, are, partially, neutralized, with, sodium, hydroxide, to, ph, 3, 4, thorium, precipitates, out, of, solution, as, hydroxide, and, is, removed, after, that, the, solution, is, treated, with, ammonium, oxalate, to, convert, rare, earths, to, their, insoluble, oxalates, the, oxalates, are, converted, to, oxides, by, annealing, the, oxides, are, dissolved, in, nitric, acid, that, excludes, one, of, the, main, components, cerium, whose, oxide, is, insoluble, in, hno, 3, lanthanum, is, separated, as, a, double, salt, with, ammonium, nitrate, by, crystallization, this, salt, is, relatively, less, soluble, than, other, rare, earth, double, salts, and, therefore, stays, in, the, residue, care, must, be, taken, when, handling, some, of, the, residues, as, they, contain, 228, ra, the, daughter, of, 232, th, which, is, a, strong, gamma, emitter, lanthanum, is, relatively, easy, to, extract, as, it, has, only, one, neighbouring, lanthanide, cerium, which, can, be, removed, by, making, use, of, its, ability, to, be, oxidised, to, the, 4, state, thereafter, lanthanum, may, be, separated, out, by, the, historical, method, of, fractional, crystallization, of, la, no, 3, 3, 2, nh, 4, no, 3, 4, h, 2, o, or, by, ion, exchange, techniques, when, higher, purity, is, desired, lanthanum, metal, is, obtained, from, its, oxide, by, heating, it, with, ammonium, chloride, or, fluoride, and, hydrofluoric, acid, at, 300, 400, c, to, produce, the, chloride, or, fluoride, this, is, followed, by, reduction, with, alkali, or, alkaline, earth, metals, in, vacuum, or, argon, atmosphere, also, pure, lanthanum, can, be, produced, by, electrolysis, of, molten, mixture, of, anhydrous, lacl, 3, and, nacl, or, kcl, at, elevated, temperatures, the, first, historical, application, of, lanthanum, was, in, gas, lantern, mantles, carl, auer, von, welsbach, used, a, mixture, of, lanthanum, oxide, and, zirconium, oxide, which, he, called, actinophor, and, patented, in, 1886, the, original, mantles, gave, a, green, tinted, light, and, were, not, very, successful, and, his, first, company, which, established, a, factory, in, atzgersdorf, in, 1887, failed, in, 1889, modern, uses, of, lanthanum, include, lanthanum, has, no, known, biological, role, in, humans, the, element, is, very, poorly, absorbed, after, oral, administration, and, when, injected, its, elimination, is, very, slow, lanthanum, carbonate, fosrenol, was, approved, as, a, phosphate, binder, to, absorb, excess, phosphate, in, cases, of, end, stage, renal, disease, while, lanthanum, has, pharmacological, effects, on, several, receptors, and, ion, channels, its, specificity, for, the, gaba, receptor, is, unique, among, trivalent, cations, lanthanum, acts, at, the, same, modulatory, site, on, the, gaba, receptor, as, zinc, a, known, negative, allosteric, modulator, the, lanthanum, cation, la, 3, is, a, positive, allosteric, modulator, at, native, and, recombinant, gaba, receptors, increasing, open, channel, time, and, decreasing, desensitization, in, a, subunit, configuration, dependent, manner, lanthanum, is, an, essential, cofactor, for, the, methanol, dehydrogenase, of, the, methanotrophic, bacterium, methylacidiphilum, fumariolicum, solv, although, the, great, chemical, similarity, of, the, lanthanides, means, that, it, may, be, substituted, with, cerium, praseodymium, or, neodymium, without, ill, effects, and, with, the, smaller, samarium, europium, or, gadolinium, giving, no, side, effects, other, than, slower, growth, lanthanum, has, a, low, to, moderate, level, of, toxicity, and, should, be, handled, with, care, the, injection, of, lanthanum, solutions, produces, hyperglycemia, low, blood, pressure, degeneration, of, the, spleen, and, hepatic, alterations, the, application, in, carbon, arc, light, led, to, the, exposure, of, people, to, rare, earth, element, oxides, and, fluorides, which, sometimes, led, to, pneumoconiosis, as, the, la, 3, ion, is, similar, in, size, to, the, ca, 2, ion, it, is, sometimes, used, as, an, easily, traced, substitute, for, the, latter, in, medical, studies, lanthanum, like, the, other, lanthanides, is, known, to, affect, human, metabolism, lowering, cholesterol, levels, blood, pressure, appetite, and, risk, of, blood, coagulation, when, injected, into, the, brain, it, acts, as, a, painkiller, similarly, to, morphine, and, other, opiates, though, the, mechanism, behind, this, is, still, unknown, lanthanum, meant, for, ingestion, typically, as, a, chewable, tablet, or, oral, powder, can, interfere, with, gastrointestinal, gi, imaging, by, creating, opacities, throughout, the, gi, tract, if, chewable, tablets, are, swallowed, whole, they, will, dissolve, but, present, initially, as, coin, shaped, opacities, in, the, stomach, potentially, confused, with, ingested, metal, objects, such, as, coins, or, batteries, the, price, for, a, metric, ton, of, lanthanum, oxide, 99, fob, china, in, usd, mt, is, given, by, the, institute, of, rare, earths, elements, and, strategic, metals, ireesm, as, below, 2, 000, for, most, of, the, period, from, early, 2001, to, september, 2010, at, 10, 000, in, the, short, term, in, 2008, it, rose, steeply, to, 140, 000, in, mid, 2011, and, fell, back, just, as, rapidly, to, 38, 000, by, early, 2012, the, average, price, for, the, last, six, months, april, september, 2022, is, given, by, the, ireesm, as, follows, lanthanum, oxide, 99, 9, min, fob, china, 1308, eur, mt, and, for, lanthanum, metal, 99, min, fob, china, 3706, eur, mt
