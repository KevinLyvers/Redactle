the, k, ppen, climate, classification, is, one, of, the, most, widely, used, climate, classification, systems, it, was, first, published, by, german, russian, climatologist, wladimir, k, ppen, 1846, 1940, in, 1884, with, several, later, modifications, by, k, ppen, notably, in, 1918, and, 1936, later, german, climatologist, rudolf, geiger, 1894, 1981, introduced, some, changes, to, the, classification, system, in, 1954, and, 1961, which, is, thus, sometimes, called, the, k, ppen, geiger, climate, classification, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, divides, climates, into, five, main, climate, groups, with, each, group, being, divided, based, on, patterns, of, seasonal, precipitation, and, temperature, the, five, main, groups, are, a, tropical, b, arid, c, temperate, d, continental, and, e, polar, each, group, and, subgroup, is, represented, by, a, letter, all, climates, are, assigned, a, main, group, the, first, letter, all, climates, except, for, those, in, the, e, group, are, assigned, a, seasonal, precipitation, subgroup, the, second, letter, for, example, af, indicates, a, tropical, rainforest, climate, the, system, assigns, a, temperature, subgroup, for, all, groups, other, than, those, in, the, a, group, indicated, by, the, third, letter, for, climates, in, b, c, d, and, the, second, letter, for, climates, in, e, for, example, cfb, indicates, an, oceanic, climate, with, warm, summers, as, indicated, by, the, ending, b, climates, are, classified, based, on, specific, criteria, unique, to, each, climate, type, as, k, ppen, designed, the, system, based, on, his, experience, as, a, botanist, his, main, climate, groups, are, based, on, the, types, of, vegetation, occurring, in, a, given, climate, classification, region, in, addition, to, identifying, climates, the, system, can, be, used, to, analyze, ecosystem, conditions, and, identify, the, main, types, of, vegetation, within, climates, due, to, its, association, with, the, plant, life, of, a, given, region, the, system, is, useful, in, predicting, future, changes, of, plant, life, within, that, region, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, system, was, modified, further, within, the, trewartha, climate, classification, system, in, 1966, revised, in, 1980, the, trewartha, system, sought, to, create, a, more, refined, middle, latitude, climate, zone, which, was, one, of, the, criticisms, of, the, k, ppen, system, the, climate, group, c, was, too, general, 200, 1, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, scheme, divides, climates, into, five, main, climate, groups, a, tropical, b, arid, c, temperate, d, continental, and, e, polar, the, second, letter, indicates, the, seasonal, precipitation, type, while, the, third, letter, indicates, the, level, of, heat, summers, are, defined, as, the, six, month, period, that, is, warmer, either, from, april, to, september, and, or, october, to, march, while, winter, is, the, six, month, period, that, is, cooler, tropical, climates, have, an, average, temperature, of, 18, c, 64, 4, f, or, higher, every, month, of, the, year, with, significant, precipitation, desert, and, semi, arid, climates, are, defined, by, low, precipitation, in, a, region, that, does, not, fit, the, polar, ef, or, et, criteria, of, no, month, with, an, average, temperature, greater, than, 10, c, 50, f, the, precipitation, threshold, in, millimeters, is, determined, by, multiplying, the, average, annual, temperature, in, celsius, by, 20, then, adding, if, the, annual, precipitation, is, less, than, 50, of, this, threshold, the, classification, is, bw, arid, desert, climate, if, it, is, in, the, range, of, 50, 100, of, the, threshold, the, classification, is, bs, semi, arid, steppe, climate, a, third, letter, can, be, included, to, indicate, temperature, here, h, signifies, low, latitude, climates, average, annual, temperature, above, 18, c, 64, 4, f, while, k, signifies, middle, latitude, climates, average, annual, temperature, less, than, 18, c, in, addition, n, is, used, to, denote, a, climate, characterized, by, frequent, fog, and, h, for, high, altitudes, temperate, climates, have, the, coldest, month, averaging, between, 0, c, 32, f, or, 3, c, 26, 6, f, and, 18, c, 64, 4, f, and, at, least, one, month, averaging, above, 10, c, 50, f, for, the, distribution, of, precipitation, in, locations, that, both, satisfy, a, dry, summer, cs, and, a, dry, winter, cw, a, location, is, considered, to, have, a, wet, summer, cw, when, more, precipitation, falls, within, the, summer, months, than, the, winter, months, while, a, location, is, considered, to, have, a, dry, summer, cs, when, more, precipitation, falls, within, the, winter, months, this, additional, criterion, applies, to, locations, that, satisfies, both, ds, and, dw, as, well, continental, climates, have, at, least, one, month, averaging, below, 0, c, 32, f, or, 3, c, 26, 6, f, and, at, least, one, month, averaging, above, 10, c, 50, f, polar, and, alpine, climates, has, every, month, of, the, year, with, an, average, temperature, below, 10, c, 50, f, tropical, climates, are, characterized, by, constant, high, temperatures, at, sea, level, and, low, elevations, all, 12, months, of, the, year, have, average, temperatures, of, 18, c, 64, 4, f, or, higher, and, generally, high, annual, precipitation, they, are, subdivided, as, follows, all, 12, months, have, an, average, precipitation, of, at, least, 60, mm, 2, 4, in, these, climates, usually, occur, within, 10, latitude, of, the, equator, this, climate, has, no, natural, seasons, in, terms, of, thermal, and, moisture, changes, when, it, is, dominated, most, of, the, year, by, the, doldrums, low, pressure, system, due, to, the, presence, of, the, intertropical, convergence, zone, itcz, and, when, there, are, no, cyclones, then, the, climate, is, qualified, as, equatorial, when, the, trade, winds, dominate, most, of, the, year, the, climate, is, a, tropical, trade, wind, rainforest, climate, examples, some, of, the, places, with, this, climate, are, indeed, uniformly, and, monotonously, wet, throughout, the, year, e, g, the, northwest, pacific, coast, of, south, and, central, america, from, ecuador, to, costa, rica, see, for, instance, andagoya, colombia, but, in, many, cases, the, period, of, higher, sun, and, longer, days, is, distinctly, wettest, as, at, palembang, indonesia, or, the, time, of, lower, sun, and, shorter, days, may, have, more, rain, as, at, sitiawan, malaysia, among, these, places, some, have, a, pure, equatorial, climate, balikpapan, kuala, lumpur, kuching, lae, medan, paramaribo, pontianak, and, singapore, with, the, dominant, itcz, aerological, mechanism, and, no, cyclones, or, a, subequatorial, climate, with, occasional, hurricanes, davao, ratnapura, victoria, note, the, term, aseasonal, refers, to, the, lack, in, the, tropical, zone, of, large, differences, in, daylight, hours, and, mean, monthly, or, daily, temperature, throughout, the, year, annual, cyclic, changes, occur, in, the, tropics, but, not, as, predictably, as, those, in, the, temperate, zone, albeit, unrelated, to, temperature, but, to, water, availability, whether, as, rain, mist, soil, or, groundwater, plant, response, e, g, phenology, animal, feeding, migration, reproduction, etc, and, human, activities, plant, sowing, harvesting, hunting, fishing, etc, are, tuned, to, this, seasonality, indeed, in, tropical, south, america, and, central, america, the, rainy, season, and, the, high, water, season, is, called, invierno, spanish, or, inverno, portuguese, though, it, could, occur, in, the, northern, hemisphere, summer, likewise, the, dry, season, and, low, water, season, is, called, verano, or, ver, o, and, can, occur, in, the, northern, hemisphere, winter, this, type, of, climate, results, from, the, monsoon, winds, which, change, direction, according, to, the, seasons, this, climate, has, a, driest, month, which, nearly, always, occurs, at, or, soon, after, the, winter, solstice, for, that, side, of, the, equator, with, rainfall, less, than, 60, mm, 2, 4, in, but, at, least, 100, t, o, t,

the, time, of, higher, sun, and, longer, days, during, summer, this, is, the, case, in, parts, of, hawaii, northwestern, dominican, republic, east, africa, southeast, india, and, northeast, sri, lanka, and, the, brazilian, northeastern, coast, in, places, that, have, this, climate, type, the, dry, season, occurs, during, the, time, of, lower, sun, and, shorter, days, generally, because, of, rain, shadow, effects, during, the, high, sun, part, of, the, year, examples, these, climates, are, characterized, by, the, amount, of, annual, precipitation, less, than, a, threshold, value, that, approximates, the, potential, evapotranspiration, 212, the, threshold, value, in, millimeters, is, calculated, as, follows, multiply, the, average, annual, temperature, in, c, by, 20, then, add, according, to, the, modified, k, ppen, classification, system, used, by, modern, climatologists, total, precipitation, in, the, warmest, six, months, of, the, year, is, taken, as, a, reference,

signifies, low, latitude, climate, average, annual, temperature, above, 18, c, while, k, signified, middle, latitude, climate, average, annual, temperature, below, 18, c, desert, areas, situated, along, the, west, coasts, of, continents, at, tropical, or, near, tropical, locations, characterized, by, frequent, fog, and, low, clouds, although, these, places, rank, among, the, driest, on, earth, in, terms, of, actual, precipitation, received, can, be, labeled, bwn, with, the, n, denoting, a, climate, characterized, by, frequent, fog, an, equivalent, bsn, category, can, be, found, in, foggy, coastal, steppes, in, the, k, ppen, climate, system, temperate, climates, are, defined, as, having, an, average, temperature, above, 0, c, 32, f, or, 3, c, 26, 6, f, as, noted, previously, in, their, coldest, month, but, below, 18, c, 64, 4, f, the, average, temperature, of, 3, c, 26, 6, f, roughly, coincides, with, the, equatorward, limit, of, frozen, ground, and, snow, cover, lasting, for, a,

above, 10, c, 50, 0, f, these, climates, usually, occur, on, the, western, sides, of, continents, between, the, latitudes, of, 30, and, 45, these, climates, are, in, the, polar, front, region, in, winter, and, thus, have, moderate, temperatures, and, changeable, rainy, weather, summers, are, hot, and, dry, due, to, the, domination, of, the, subtropical, high, pressure, systems, except, in, the, immediate, coastal, areas, where, summers, are, milder, due, to, the, nearby, presence, of, cold, ocean, currents, that, may, bring, fog, but, prevent, rain, 221, 223, examples, dry, summer, climates, sometimes, extend, to, additional, areas, where, the, warmest, month, average, temperatures, do, not, reach, 22, c, 71, 6, f, most, often, in, the, 40s, latitudes, these, climates, are, classified, as, csb, examples, cold, summer, mediterranean, climates, csc, exist, in, high, elevation, areas, adjacent, to, coastal, csb, climate, areas, where, the, strong, maritime, influence, prevents, the, average, winter, monthly, temperature, from, dropping, below, 0, c, this, climate, is, rare, and, is, predominantly, found, in, climate, fringes, and, isolated, areas, of, the, cascades, and, andes, mountains, as, the, dry, summer, climate, extends, further, poleward, in, the, americas, than, elsewhere, rare, instances, of, this, climate, can, be, found, in, some, coastal, locations, in, the, north, atlantic, and, at, high, altitudes, in, hawaii, examples, these, climates, usually, occur, on, the, eastern, coasts, and, eastern, sides, of, continents, usually, in, the, high, 20s, and, 30s, latitudes, unlike, the, dry, summer, mediterranean, climates, humid, subtropical, climates, have, a, warm, and, wet, flow, from, the, tropics, that, creates, warm, and, moist, conditions, in, the, summer, months, as, such, summer, not, winter, as, is, the, case, in, mediterranean, climates, is, often, the, wettest, season, the, flow, out, of, the, subtropical, highs, and, the, summer, monsoon, creates, a, southerly, flow, from, the, tropics, that, brings, warm, and, moist, air, to, the, lower, east, sides, of, continents, this, flow, is, often, what, brings, the, frequent, and, strong, but, short, lived, summer, thundershowers, so, typical, of, the, more, southerly, subtropical, climates, like, the, southeast, united, states, southern, china, and, japan, 223, 226, examples, cfb, climates, usually, occur, in, the, higher, middle, latitudes, on, the, western, sides, of, continents, they, are, typically, situated, immediately, poleward, of, the, mediterranean, climates, in, the, 40s, and, 50s, latitudes, however, in, southeast, australia, southeast, south, america, and, extreme, southern, africa, this, climate, is, found, immediately, poleward, of, temperate, climates, on, places, near, the, coast, and, at, a, somewhat, lower, latitude, in, western, europe, this, climate, occurs, in, coastal, areas, up, to, 68, n, in, norway, these, climates, are, dominated, all, year, round, by, the, polar, front, leading, to, changeable, often, overcast, weather, summers, are, mild, due, to, cool, ocean, currents, winters, are, milder, than, other, climates, in, similar, latitudes, but, usually, very, cloudy, and, frequently, wet, cfb, climates, are, also, encountered, at, high, elevations, in, certain, subtropical, and, tropical, areas, where, the, climate, would, be, that, of, a, subtropical, tropical, rainforest, if, not, for, the, altitude, these, climates, are, called, highlands, 226, 229, examples, subtropical, highland, climates, with, uniform, rainfall, cfb, are, a, type, of, oceanic, climate, mainly, found, in, the, highlands, of, australia, such, as, in, or, around, the, great, dividing, range, in, the, north, of, the, state, of, new, south, wales, and, also, sparsely, in, other, continents, such, as, in, south, america, among, others, unlike, a, typical, cwb, climate, they, tend, to, have, rainfall, spread, evenly, throughout, the, year, they, have, characteristics, of, both, the, cfb, and, cfa, climates, but, unlike, these, climates, they, have, a, high, diurnal, temperature, variation, and, low, humidity, owing, to, their, inland, location, and, relatively, high, elevation, examples, subpolar, oceanic, climates, cfc, occur, poleward, of, or, at, higher, elevations, than, the, maritime, temperate, climates, and, are, mostly, confined, either, to, narrow, coastal, strips, on, the, western, poleward, margins, of, the, continents, or, especially, in, the, northern, hemisphere, to, islands, off, such, coasts, they, occur, in, both, hemispheres, generally, in, the, high, 50s, and, 60s, latitudes, in, the, northern, hemisphere, and, the, 50s, latitudes, in, the, southern, hemisphere, examples, cwa, is, a, monsoonal, influenced, version, of, the, humid, subtropical, climate, having, the, classic, dry, winter, wet, summer, pattern, associated, with, tropical, monsoonal, climates, they, are, found, at, similar, latitudes, as, the, cfa, climates, except, in, regions, where, monsoons, are, more, prevalent, these, regions, are, in, the, southern, cone, of, south, america, the, gangetic, plain, of, south, asia, southeastern, africa, and, parts, of, east, asia, and, mexico, examples, dry, winter, subtropical, highland, climate, cwb, is, a, type, of, climate, mainly, found, in, highlands, inside, the, tropics, of, central, america, south, america, africa, and, south, and, southeast, asia, or, areas, in, the, subtropics, winters, are, noticeable, and, dry, and, summers, can, be, very, rainy, in, the, tropics, the, monsoon, is, provoked, by, the, tropical, air, masses, and, the, dry, winters, by, subtropical, high, pressure, examples, dry, winter, cold, subtropical, highland, climates, cwc, exist, in, high, elevation, areas, adjacent, to, cwb, climates, this, climate, is, rare, and, is, found, mainly, in, isolated, locations, mostly, in, the, andes, in, bolivia, and, peru, as, well, as, in, sparse, mountain, locations, in, southeast, asia, these, climates, have, an, average, temperature, above, 10, c, 50, f, in, their, warmest, months, and, the, coldest, month, average, below, 0, c, or, 3, c, 26, 6, f, as, noted, previously, these, usually, occur, in, the, interiors, of, continents, and, on, their, upper, east, coasts, normally, north, of, 40, n, in, the, southern, hemisphere, group, d, climates, are, extremely, rare, due, to, the, smaller, land, masses, in, the, middle, latitudes, and, the, almost, complete, absence, of, land, at, 40, 60, s, existing, only, in, some, highland, locations, dfa, climates, usually, occur, in, the, high, 30s, and, low, 40s, latitudes, with, a, qualifying, average, temperature, in, the, warmest, month, of, greater, than, 22, c, 72, f, in, europe, these, climates, tend, to, be, much, drier, than, in, north, america, dsa, exists, at, higher, elevations, adjacent, to, areas, with, hot, summer, mediterranean, csa, climates, 231, 32, these, climates, exist, only, in, the, northern, hemisphere, because, the, southern, hemisphere, has, no, large, landmasses, isolated, from, the, moderating, effects, of, the, sea, within, the, middle, latitudes, examples, in, eastern, asia, dwa, climates, extend, further, south, into, the, mid, 30s, latitudes, due, to, the, influence, of, the, siberian, high, pressure, system, which, also, causes, winters, there, to, be, dry, and, summers, can, be, very, wet, because, of, monsoon, circulation, examples, dsa, exists, only, at, higher, elevations, adjacent, to, areas, with, hot, summer, mediterranean, csa, climates, examples, dfb, climates, are, immediately, poleward, of, hot, summer, continental, climates, generally, in, the, high, 40s, and, low, 50s, latitudes, in, north, america, and, asia, and, also, extending, to, higher, latitudes, into, the, high, 50s, and, low, 60s, latitudes, in, central, and, eastern, europe, between, the, maritime, temperate, and, continental, subarctic, climates, examples, like, with, all, group, d, climates, dwb, climates, mostly, only, occur, in, the, northern, hemisphere, examples, dsb, arises, from, the, same, scenario, as, dsa, but, at, even, higher, altitudes, or, latitudes, and, chiefly, in, north, america, since, the, mediterranean, climates, extend, further, poleward, than, in, eurasia, examples, dfc, dsc, and, dwc, climates, occur, poleward, of, the, other, group, d, climates, or, at, higher, altitudes, generally, in, the, 50s, and, 60s, latitudes, 232, 235, examples, places, with, this, climate, have, severe, winters, with, the, temperature, in, their, coldest, month, lower, than, 38, c, these, climates, occur, only, in, eastern, siberia, and, are, the, second, coldest, before, ef, the, coldest, recorded, temperatures, in, the, northern, hemisphere, belonged, to, this, climate, the, names, of, some, of, the, places, with, this, climate, have, become, veritable, synonyms, for, the, extreme, severe, winter, cold, examples, in, the, k, ppen, climate, system, polar, climates, are, defined, as, the, warmest, temperature, of, any, month, being, below, 10, c, 50, f, polar, climates, are, further, divided, into, two, types, tundra, climates, and, icecap, climates, tundra, climate, et, warmest, month, has, an, average, temperature, between, 0, and, 10, c, these, climates, occur, on, the, northern, edges, of, the, north, american, and, eurasian, land, masses, generally, north, of, 70, n, although, they, may, be, found, farther, south, depending, on, local, conditions, and, on, nearby, islands, et, climates, are, also, found, on, some, islands, near, the, antarctic, convergence, and, at, high, elevations, outside, the, polar, regions, above, the, tree, line, examples, ice, cap, climate, ef, this, climate, is, dominant, in, antarctica, inner, greenland, and, summits, of, many, high, mountains, even, at, lower, latitudes, monthly, average, temperatures, never, exceed, 0, c, 32, f, examples, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, is, based, on, the, empirical, relationship, between, climate, and, vegetation, this, classification, provides, an, efficient, way, to, describe, climatic, conditions, defined, by, temperature, and, precipitation, and, their, seasonality, with, a, single, metric, because, climatic, conditions, identified, by, the, k, ppen, classification, are, ecologically, relevant, it, has, been, widely, used, to, map, the, geographic, distribution, of, long, term, climate, and, associated, ecosystem, conditions, over, recent, years, there, has, been, an, increasing, interest, in, using, the, classification, to, identify, changes, in, climate, and, potential, changes, in, vegetation, over, time, the, most, important, ecological, significance, of, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, is, that, it, helps, to, predict, the, dominant, vegetation, type, based, on, the, climatic, data, and, vice, versa, in, 2015, a, nanjing, university, paper, published, in, scientific, reports, analyzing, climate, classifications, found, that, between, 1950, and, 2010, approximately, 5, 7, of, all, land, area, worldwide, had, moved, from, wetter, and, colder, classifications, to, drier, and, hotter, classifications, the, authors, also, found, that, the, change, cannot, be, explained, as, natural, variations, but, are, driven, by, anthropogenic, factors, a, 2018, study, provides, detailed, maps, for, present, and, future, k, ppen, geiger, climate, classification, maps, at, 1, km, resolution, all, maps, use, the, 0, c, definition, for, the, temperate, continental, border
