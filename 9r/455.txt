end, users, for, pigment, grade, titanium, dioxide, include, akzo, nobel, ppg, industries, sherwin, williams, basf, kansai, paints, and, valspar, global, tio, 2, pigment, demand, for, 2010, was, 5, 3, mt, with, annual, growth, expected, to, be, about, 3, 4, the, production, method, depends, on, the, feedstock, in, addition, to, ores, other, feedstocks, include, upgraded, slag, both, the, chloride, process, and, the, sulfate, process, both, described, below, produce, titanium, dioxide, pigment, in, the, rutile, crystal, form, but, the, sulfate, process, can, be, adjusted, to, produce, the, anatase, form, anatase, being, softer, is, used, in, fiber, and, paper, applications, the, sulfate, process, is, run, as, a, batch, process, the, chloride, process, is, run, as, a, continuous, process, in, chloride, process, the, ore, is, treated, with, chlorine, and, carbon, to, give, titanium, tetrachloride, a, volatile, liquid, that, is, further, purified, by, distillation, the, ticl4, is, treated, with, oxygen, to, regenerate, chlorine, and, produce, the, titanium, dioxide, in, the, sulfate, process, ilmenite, is, treated, with, sulfuric, acid, to, extract, iron, ii, sulfate, pentahydrate, this, process, requires, concentrated, ilmenite, 45, 60, tio, 2, or, pretreated, feedstocks, as, a, suitable, source, of, titanium, the, resulting, synthetic, rutile, is, further, processed, according, to, the, specifications, of, the, end, user, i, e, pigment, grade, or, otherwise, examples, of, plants, using, the, sulfate, process, are, the, sorel, tracy, plant, of, qit, fer, et, titane, and, the, eramet, titanium, iron, smelter, in, tyssedal, norway, the, becher, process, is, another, method, for, the, production, of, synthetic, rutile, from, ilmenite, it, first, oxidizes, the, ilmenite, as, a, means, to, separate, the, iron, component, for, specialty, applications, tio, 2, films, are, prepared, by, various, specialized, chemistries, sol, gel, routes, involve, the, hydrolysis, of, titanium, alkoxides, such, as, titanium, ethoxide, a, related, approach, that, also, relies, on, molecular, precursors, involves, chemical, vapor, deposition, in, this, method, the, alkoxide, is, volatilized, and, then, decomposed, on, contact, with, a, hot, surface, first, mass, produced, in, 1916, titanium, dioxide, is, the, most, widely, used, white, pigment, because, of, its, brightness, and, very, high, refractive, index, in, which, it, is, surpassed, only, by, a, few, other, materials, see, list, of, indices, of, refraction, titanium, dioxide, crystal, size, is, ideally, around, 220, nm, measured, by, electron, microscope, to, optimize, the, maximum, reflection, of, visible, light, however, abnormal, grain, growth, is, often, observed, in, titanium, dioxide, particularly, in, its, rutile, phase, the, occurrence, of, abnormal, grain, growth, brings, about, a, deviation, of, a, small, number, of, crystallites, from, the, mean, crystal, size, and, modifies, the, physical, behaviour, of, tio, 2, the, optical, properties, of, the, finished, pigment, are, highly, sensitive, to, purity, as, little, as, a, few, parts, per, million, ppm, of, certain, metals, cr, v, cu, fe, nb, can, disturb, the, crystal, lattice, so, much, that, the, effect, can, be, detected, in, quality, control, approximately, 4, 6, million, tons, of, pigmentary, tio, 2, are, used, annually, worldwide, and, this, number, is, expected, to, increase, as, use, continues, to, rise, tio, 2, is, also, an, effective, opacifier, in, powder, form, where, it, is, employed, as, a, pigment, to, provide, whiteness, and, opacity, to, products, such, as, paints, coatings, plastics, papers, inks, foods, supplements, medicines, i, e, pills, and, tablets, and, most, toothpastes, in, 2019, it, was, present, in, two, thirds, of, toothpastes, on, the, french, market, in, food, it, is, commonly, found, in, products, like, ice, creams, chocolates, all, types, of, candy, creamers, desserts, marshmallows, chewing, gum, pastries, spreads, dressings, cakes, and, many, other, foods, in, paint, it, is, often, referred, to, offhandedly, as, brilliant, white, the, perfect, white, the, whitest, white, or, other, similar, terms, opacity, is, improved, by, optimal, sizing, of, the, titanium, dioxide, particles, when, deposited, as, a, thin, film, its, refractive, index, and, colour, make, it, an, excellent, reflective, optical, coating, for, dielectric, mirrors, it, is, also, used, in, generating, decorative, thin, films, such, as, found, in, mystic, fire, topaz, some, grades, of, modified, titanium, based, pigments, as, used, in, sparkly, paints, plastics, finishes, and, cosmetics, these, are, man, made, pigments, whose, particles, have, two, or, more, layers, of, various, oxides, often, titanium, dioxide, iron, oxide, or, alumina, in, order, to, have, glittering, iridescent, and, or, pearlescent, effects, similar, to, crushed, mica, or, guanine, based, products, in, addition, to, these, effects, a, limited, colour, change, is, possible, in, certain, formulations, depending, on, how, and, at, which, angle, the, finished, product, is, illuminated, and, the, thickness, of, the, oxide, layer, in, the, pigment, particle, one, or, more, colours, appear, by, reflection, while, the, other, tones, appear, due, to, interference, of, the, transparent, titanium, dioxide, layers, in, some, products, the, layer, of, titanium, dioxide, is, grown, in, conjunction, with, iron, oxide, by, calcination, of, titanium, salts, sulfates, chlorates, around, 800, c, one, example, of, a, pearlescent, pigment, is, iriodin, based, on, mica, coated, with, titanium, dioxide, or, iron, iii, oxide, the, iridescent, effect, in, these, titanium, oxide, particles, is, unlike, the, opaque, effect, obtained, with, usual, ground, titanium, oxide, pigment, obtained, by, mining, in, which, case, only, a, certain, diameter, of, the, particle, is, considered, and, the, effect, is, due, only, to, scattering, in, cosmetic, and, skin, care, products, titanium, dioxide, is, used, as, a, pigment, sunscreen, and, a, thickener, as, a, sunscreen, ultrafine, tio, 2, is, used, which, is, notable, in, that, combined, with, ultrafine, zinc, oxide, it, is, considered, to, be, an, effective, sunscreen, that, lowers, the, incidence, of, sun, burns, and, minimizes, the, premature, photoaging, photocarcinogenesis, and, immunosuppression, associated, with, long, term, excess, sun, exposure, sometimes, these, uv, blockers, are, combined, with, iron, oxide, pigments, in, sunscreen, to, increase, visible, light, protection, titanium, dioxide, and, zinc, oxide, are, generally, considered, to, be, less, harmful, to, coral, reefs, than, sunscreens, that, include, chemicals, such, as, oxybenzone, octocrylene, and, octinoxate, nanosized, titanium, dioxide, is, found, in, the, majority, of, physical, sunscreens, because, of, its, strong, uv, light, absorbing, capabilities, and, its, resistance, to, discolouration, under, ultraviolet, light, this, advantage, enhances, its, stability, and, ability, to, protect, the, skin, from, ultraviolet, light, nano, scaled, particle, size, of, 20, 40, nm, titanium, dioxide, particles, are, primarily, used, in, sunscreen, lotion, because, they, scatter, visible, light, much, less, than, titanium, dioxide, pigments, and, can, give, uv, protection, sunscreens, designed, for, infants, or, people, with, sensitive, skin, are, often, based, on, titanium, dioxide, and, or, zinc, oxide, as, these, mineral, uv, blockers, are, believed, to, cause, less, skin, irritation, than, other, uv, absorbing, chemicals, nano, tio, 2, which, blocks, both, uv, a, and, uv, b, radiation, is, used, in, sunscreens, and, other, cosmetic, products, the, eu, scientific, committee, on, consumer, safety, considered, nano, sized, titanium, dioxide, to, be, safe, for, skin, applications, in, concentrations, of, up, to, 25, percent, based, on, animal, testing, the, risk, assessment, of, different, titanium, dioxide, nanomaterials, in, sunscreen, is, currently, evolving, since, nano, sized, tio, 2, is, different, from, the, well, known, micronized, form, the, rutile, form, is, generally, used, in, cosmetic, and, sunscreen, products, due, to, it, not, possessing, any, observed, ability, to, damage, the, skin, under, normal, conditions, and, having, a, higher, uv, absorption, in, 2016, scientific, committee, on, consumer, safety, sccs, tests, concluded, that, the, use, of, nano, titanium, dioxide, 95, 100, rutile, 5, anatase, as, a, uv, filter, can, be, considered, to, not, pose, any, risk, of, adverse, effects, in, humans, post, application, on, healthy, skin, except, in, the, case, the, application, method, would, lead, to, substantial, risk, of, inhalation, ie, powder, or, spray, formulations, this, safety, opinion, applied, to, nano, tio, 2, in, concentrations, of, up, to, 25, initial, studies, indicated, that, nano, tio, 2, particles, could, penetrate, the, skin, causing, concern, over, its, use, these, studies, were, later, refuted, when, it, was, discovered, that, the, testing, methodology, couldn, t, differentiate, between, penetrated, particles, and, particles, simply, trapped, in, hair, follicles, and, that, having, a, diseased, or, physically, damaged, dermis, could, be, the, true, cause, of, insufficient, barrier, protection, sccs, research, found, that, when, nanoparticles, had, certain, photostable, coatings, e, g, alumina, silica, cetyl, phosphate, triethoxycaprylylsilane, manganese, dioxide, the, photocatalytic, activity, was, attenuated, and, no, notable, skin, penetration, was, observed, the, sunscreen, in, this, research, was, applied, at, amounts, of, 10, mg, cm2, for, exposure, periods, of, 24, hours, coating, tio, 2, with, alumina, silica, zircon, or, various, polymers, can, minimize, avobenzone, degradation, and, enhance, uv, absorption, by, adding, an, additional, light, diffraction, mechanism, tio, 2, is, used, extensively, in, plastics, and, other, applications, as, a, white, pigment, or, an, opacifier, and, for, its, uv, resistant, properties, where, the, powder, disperses, light, unlike, organic, uv, absorbers, and, reduces, uv, damage, due, mostly, to, the, particle, s, high, refractive, index, in, ceramic, glazes, titanium, dioxide, acts, as, an, opacifier, and, seeds, crystal, formation, it, is, used, as, a, tattoo, pigment, and, in, styptic, pencils, titanium, dioxide, is, produced, in, varying, particle, sizes, which, are, both, oil, and, water, dispersible, and, in, certain, grades, for, the, cosmetic, industry, it, is, also, a, common, ingredient, in, toothpaste, the, exterior, of, the, saturn, v, rocket, was, painted, with, titanium, dioxide, this, later, allowed, astronomers, to, determine, that, j002e3, was, likely, the, s, ivb, stage, from, apollo, 12, and, not, an, asteroid, between, 2002, and, 2022, there, were, 459, patent, families, that, describe, the, production, of, titanium, dioxide, from, ilmenite, the, majority, of, these, patents, describe, pre, treatment, processes, such, as, using, smelting, and, magnetic, separation, to, increase, titanium, concentration, in, low, grade, ores, leading, to, titanium, concentrates, or, slags, other, patents, describe, processes, to, obtain, titanium, dioxide, either, by, a, direct, hydrometallurgical, process, or, through, the, main, industrial, production, processes, the, sulfate, process, and, the, chloride, process, the, sulfate, process, represents, 40, of, the, world, s, titanium, dioxide, production, and, is, protected, in, 23, of, patent, families, the, chloride, process, is, only, mentioned, in, 8, of, patent, families, although, it, provides, 60, of, the, worldwide, industrial, production, of, titanium, dioxide, key, contributors, to, patents, on, the, production, of, titanium, dioxide, are, companies, from, china, australia, and, the, united, states, reflecting, the, major, contribution, of, these, countries, to, industrial, production, chinese, companies, pangang, and, lomon, billions, groups, hold, major, patent, portfolios, nanosized, titanium, dioxide, particularly, in, the, anatase, form, exhibits, photocatalytic, activity, under, ultraviolet, uv, irradiation, this, photoactivity, is, reportedly, most, pronounced, at, the, 001, planes, of, anatase, although, the, 101, planes, are, thermodynamically, more, stable, and, thus, more, prominent, in, most, synthesised, and, natural, anatase, as, evident, by, the, often, observed, tetragonal, dipyramidal, growth, habit, interfaces, between, rutile, and, anatase, are, further, considered, to, improve, photocatalytic, activity, by, facilitating, charge, carrier, separation, and, as, a, result, biphasic, titanium, dioxide, is, often, considered, to, possess, enhanced, functionality, as, a, photocatalyst, it, has, been, reported, that, titanium, dioxide, when, doped, with, nitrogen, ions, or, doped, with, metal, oxide, like, tungsten, trioxide, exhibits, excitation, also, under, visible, light, the, strong, oxidative, potential, of, the, positive, holes, oxidizes, water, to, create, hydroxyl, radicals, it, can, also, oxidize, oxygen, or, organic, materials, directly, hence, in, addition, to, its, use, as, a, pigment, titanium, dioxide, can, be, added, to, paints, cements, windows, tiles, or, other, products, for, its, sterilizing, deodorizing, and, anti, fouling, properties, and, is, used, as, a, hydrolysis, catalyst, it, is, also, used, in, dye, sensitized, solar, cells, which, are, a, type, of, chemical, solar, cell, also, known, as, a, graetzel, cell, the, photocatalytic, properties, of, nanosized, titanium, dioxide, were, discovered, by, akira, fujishima, in, 1967, and, published, in, 1972, the, process, on, the, surface, of, the, titanium, dioxide, was, called, the, honda, fujishima, effect, in, thin, film, and, nanoparticle, form, titanium, dioxide, has, the, potential, for, use, in, energy, production, as, a, photocatalyst, it, can, break, water, into, hydrogen, and, oxygen, with, the, hydrogen, collected, it, could, be, used, as, a, fuel, the, efficiency, of, this, process, can, be, greatly, improved, by, doping, the, oxide, with, carbon, further, efficiency, and, durability, has, been, obtained, by, introducing, disorder, to, the, lattice, structure, of, the, surface, layer, of, titanium, dioxide, nanocrystals, permitting, infrared, absorption, visible, light, active, nanosized, anatase, and, rutile, has, been, developed, for, photocatalytic, applications, in, 1995, fujishima, and, his, group, discovered, the, superhydrophilicity, phenomenon, for, titanium, dioxide, coated, glass, exposed, to, sun, light, this, resulted, in, the, development, of, self, cleaning, glass, and, anti, fogging, coatings, nanosized, tio, 2, incorporated, into, outdoor, building, materials, such, as, paving, stones, in, noxer, blocks, or, paints, could, reduce, concentrations, of, airborne, pollutants, such, as, volatile, organic, compounds, and, nitrogen, oxides, a, tio, 2, containing, cement, has, been, produced, using, tio, 2, as, a, photocatalyst, attempts, have, been, made, to, mineralize, pollutants, to, convert, into, co, 2, and, h, 2, o, in, waste, water, the, photocatalytic, destruction, of, organic, matter, could, also, be, exploited, in, coatings, with, antimicrobial, applications, although, nanosized, anatase, tio, 2, does, not, absorb, visible, light, it, does, strongly, absorb, ultraviolet, uv, radiation, hv, leading, to, the, formation, of, hydroxyl, radicals, this, occurs, when, photo, induced, valence, bond, holes, h, vb, are, trapped, at, the, surface, of, tio, 2, leading, to, the, formation, of, trapped, holes, h, tr, that, cannot, oxidize, water, anatase, can, be, converted, into, non, carbon, nanotubes, and, nanowires, hollow, tio, 2, nanofibers, can, be, also, prepared, by, coating, carbon, nanofibers, by, first, applying, titanium, butoxide, as, of, may, 2023, following, the, european, union, 2022, ban, the, u, s, states, california, and, new, york, were, considering, banning, the, use, of, titanium, dioxide, in, foods, the, european, union, removed, the, authorization, to, use, titanium, dioxide, e, 171, in, foods, effective, 7, february, 2022, with, a, six, months, grace, period, titanium, dioxide, dust, when, inhaled, has, been, classified, by, the, international, agency, for, research, on, cancer, iarc, as, an, iarc, group, 2b, carcinogen, meaning, it, is, possibly, carcinogenic, to, humans, the, us, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, recommends, two, separate, exposure, limits, niosh, recommends, that, fine, tio, 2, particles, be, set, at, an, exposure, limit, of, 2, 4, mg, m, 3, while, ultrafine, tio, 2, be, set, at, an, exposure, limit, of, 0, 3, mg, m, 3, as, time, weighted, average, concentrations, up, to, 10, hours, a, day, for, a, 40, hour, work, week, as, of, 2006, titanium, dioxide, had, been, regarded, as, completely, nontoxic, widely, occurring, minerals, and, even, gemstones, are, composed, of, tio, 2, all, natural, titanium, comprising, more, than, 0, 5, of, the, earth, s, crust, exists, as, oxides, although, no, evidence, points, to, acute, toxicity, recurring, concerns, have, been, expressed, about, nanophase, forms, of, these, materials, studies, of, workers, with, high, exposure, to, tio, 2, particles, indicate, that, even, at, high, exposure, there, is, no, adverse, effect, to, human, health, titanium, dioxide, tio, is, mostly, introduced, into, the, environment, as, nanoparticles, via, wastewater, treatment, plants, cosmetic, pigments, including, titanium, dioxide, enter, the, wastewater, when, the, product, is, washed, off, into, sinks, after, cosmetic, use, once, in, the, sewage, treatment, plants, pigments, separate, into, sewage, sludge, which, can, then, be, released, into, the, soil, when, injected, into, the, soil, or, distributed, on, its, surface, 99, of, these, nanoparticles, wind, up, on, land, rather, than, in, aquatic, environments, due, to, their, retention, in, sewage, sludge, in, the, environment, titanium, dioxide, nanoparticles, have, low, to, negligible, solubility, and, have, been, shown, to, be, stable, once, particle, aggregates, are, formed, in, soil, and, water, surroundings, in, the, process, of, dissolution, water, soluble, ions, typically, dissociate, from, the, nanoparticle, into, solution, when, thermodynamically, unstable, tio, 2, dissolution, increases, when, there, are, higher, levels, of, dissolved, organic, matter, and, clay, in, the, soil, however, aggregation, is, promoted, by, ph, at, the, isoelectric, point, of, tio, 2, ph, 5, 8, which, renders, it, neutral, and, solution, ion, concentrations, above, 4, 5, mm, tio, 2, whitener, in, food, was, banned, in, france, from, 2020, due, to, uncertainty, about, safe, quantities, for, human, consumption, in, 2021, the, european, food, safety, authority, efsa, ruled, that, as, a, consequence, of, new, understandings, of, nanoparticles, titanium, dioxide, could, no, longer, be, considered, safe, as, a, food, additive, and, the, eu, health, commissioner, announced, plans, to, ban, its, use, across, the, eu, with, discussions, beginning, in, june, 2021, efsa, concluded, that, genotoxicity, which, could, lead, to, carcinogenic, effects, could, not, be, ruled, out, and, that, a, safe, level, for, daily, intake, of, the, food, additive, could, not, be, established, in, 2022, the, uk, food, standards, agency, and, food, standards, scotland, announced, their, disagreement, with, the, efsa, ruling, and, did, not, follow, the, eu, in, banning, titanium, dioxide, as, a, food, additive, health, canada, similarly, reviewed, the, available, evidence, in, 2022, and, decided, not, to, change, their, position, on, titanium, dioxide, as, a, food, additive, as, of, 2024, the, food, and, drug, administration, fda, in, the, united, states, permits, titanium, dioxide, as, a, food, additive, it, is, commonly, used, to, increase, whiteness, and, opacity, in, dairy, products, lowfat, milk, cream, ice, cream, yogurt, etc, candies, frostings, fillings, and, many, other, foods, the, fda, permits, the, product, s, ingredients, list, to, identify, titanium, dioxide, as, color, added, or, artificial, colors, and, does, not, require, that, titanium, dioxide, be, explicitly, named, despite, growing, scientific, concerns, in, 2023, the, consumer, healthcare, products, association, a, manufacturer, s, trade, group, defended, the, substance, as, safe, at, certain, limits, while, allowing, that, additional, studies, could, provide, further, insight, saying, an, immediate, ban, would, be, a, knee, jerk, reaction, due, to, the, potential, that, long, term, ingestion, of, titanium, dioxide, may, be, toxic, particularly, to, cells, and, functions, of, the, gastrointestinal, tract, preliminary, research, as, of, 2021, was, assessing, its, possible, role, in, disease, development, such, as, inflammatory, bowel, disease, and, colorectal, cancer, companies, such, as, dunkin, donuts, dropped, titanium, dioxide, from, their, merchandise, in, 2015, after, public, pressure, andrew, maynard, director, of, risk, science, center, at, the, university, of, michigan, rejected, the, supposed, danger, from, use, of, titanium, dioxide, in, food, he, says, that, the, titanium, dioxide, used, by, dunkin, brands, and, many, other, food, producers, is, not, a, new, material, and, it, is, not, a, nanomaterial, either, nanoparticles, are, typically, smaller, than, 100, nanometres, in,
