color, theory, or, more, specifically, traditional, color, theory, is, the, historical, body, of, knowledge, describing, the, behavior, of, colors, namely, in, color, mixing, color, contrast, effects, color, harmony, color, schemes, and, color, symbolism, modern, color, theory, is, generally, referred, to, as, color, science, while, there, is, no, clear, distinction, in, scope, traditional, color, theory, tends, to, be, more, subjective, and, have, artistic, applications, while, color, science, tends, to, be, more, objective, and, have, functional, applications, such, as, in, chemistry, astronomy, or, color, reproduction, color, theory, dates, back, at, least, as, far, as, aristotle, s, treatise, on, colors, a, formalization, of, color, theory, began, in, the, 18th, century, initially, within, a, partisan, controversy, over, isaac, newton, s, theory, of, color, opticks, 1704, and, the, nature, of, primary, colors, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, a, schism, had, formed, between, traditional, color, theory, and, color, science, color, theory, is, rooted, in, antiquity, with, early, musings, on, color, in, aristotle, s, d, 322, bce, on, colors, and, claudius, ptolemy, s, d, 168, ce, optics, the, influence, of, light, on, color, was, investigated, and, revealed, further, by, al, kindi, d, 873, and, ibn, al, haytham, d, 1039, ibn, sina, d, 1037, nasir, al, din, al, tusi, d, 1274, and, robert, grosseteste, d, 1253, discovered, that, contrary, to, the, teachings, of, aristotle, there, are, multiple, color, paths, to, get, from, black, to, white, more, modern, approaches, to, color, theory, principles, can, be, found, in, the, writings, of, leone, battista, alberti, c, 1435, and, the, notebooks, of, leonardo, da, vinci, c, 1490, the, ryb, primary, colors, became, the, foundation, of, 18th, century, theories, of, color, vision, as, the, fundamental, sensory, qualities, that, are, blended, in, the, perception, of, all, physical, colors, and, conversely, in, the, physical, mixture, of, pigments, or, dyes, these, theories, were, enhanced, by, 18th, century, investigations, of, a, variety, of, purely, psychological, color, effects, in, particular, the, contrast, between, complementary, or, opposing, hues, that, are, produced, by, color, afterimages, and, in, the, contrasting, shadows, in, colored, light, these, ideas, and, many, personal, color, observations, were, summarized, in, two, founding, documents, in, color, theory, the, theory, of, colours, 1810, by, the, german, poet, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, and, the, law, of, simultaneous, color, contrast, 1839, by, the, french, industrial, chemist, michel, eug, ne, chevreul, charles, hayter, published, a, new, practical, treatise, on, the, three, primitive, colours, assumed, as, a, perfect, system, of, rudimentary, information, london, 1826, in, which, he, described, how, all, colors, could, be, obtained, from, just, three, subsequently, german, and, english, scientists, established, in, the, late, 19th, century, that, color, perception, is, best, described, in, terms, of, a, different, set, of, primary, colors, red, green, and, blue, violet, rgb, modeled, through, the, additive, mixture, of, three, monochromatic, lights, subsequent, research, anchored, these, primary, colors, in, the, differing, responses, to, light, by, three, types, of, color, receptors, or, cones, in, the, retina, trichromacy, on, this, basis, the, quantitative, description, of, the, color, mixture, or, colorimetry, developed, in, the, early, 20th, century, along, with, a, series, of, increasingly, sophisticated, models, of, color, space, and, color, perception, such, as, the, opponent, process, theory, across, the, same, period, industrial, chemistry, radically, expanded, the, color, range, of, lightfast, synthetic, pigments, allowing, for, substantially, improved, saturation, in, color, mixtures, of, dyes, paints, and, inks, it, also, created, the, dyes, and, chemical, processes, necessary, for, color, photography, as, a, result, three, color, printing, became, aesthetically, and, economically, feasible, in, mass, printed, media, and, the, artists, color, theory, was, adapted, to, primary, colors, most, effective, in, inks, or, photographic, dyes, cyan, magenta, and, yellow, cmy, in, printing, dark, colors, are, supplemented, by, black, ink, known, as, the, cmyk, system, in, both, printing, and, photography, white, is, provided, by, the, color, of, the, paper, these, cmy, primary, colors, were, reconciled, with, the, rgb, primaries, and, subtractive, color, mixing, with, additive, color, mixing, by, defining, the, cmy, primaries, as, substances, that, absorbed, only, one, of, the, retinal, primary, colors, cyan, absorbs, only, red, r, g, b, magenta, only, green, r, g, b, and, yellow, only, blue, violet, r, g, b, it, is, important, to, add, that, the, cmyk, or, process, color, printing, is, meant, as, an, economical, way, of, producing, a, wide, range, of, colors, for, printing, but, is, deficient, in, reproducing, certain, colors, notably, orange, and, slightly, deficient, in, reproducing, purples, a, wider, range, of, colors, can, be, obtained, with, the, addition, of, other, colors, to, the, printing, process, such, as, in, pantone, s, hexachrome, printing, ink, system, six, colors, among, others, for, much, of, the, 19th, century, artistic, color, theory, either, lagged, behind, scientific, understanding, or, was, augmented, by, science, books, written, for, the, lay, public, in, particular, modern, chromatics, 1879, by, the, american, physicist, ogden, rood, and, early, color, atlases, developed, by, albert, munsell, munsell, book, of, color, 1915, see, munsell, color, system, and, wilhelm, ostwald, color, atlas, 1919, major, advances, were, made, in, the, early, 20th, century, by, artists, teaching, or, associated, with, the, german, bauhaus, in, particular, wassily, kandinsky, johannes, itten, faber, birren, and, josef, albers, whose, writings, mix, speculation, with, an, empirical, or, demonstration, based, study, of, color, design, principles, one, of, the, earliest, purposes, of, color, theory, was, to, establish, rules, governing, the, mixing, of, pigments, traditional, color, theory, was, built, around, pure, or, ideal, colors, characterized, by, different, sensory, experiences, rather, than, attributes, of, the, physical, world, this, has, led, to, several, inaccuracies, in, traditional, color, theory, principles, that, are, not, always, remedied, in, modern, formulations, another, issue, has, been, the, tendency, to, describe, color, effects, holistically, or, categorically, for, example, as, a, contrast, between, yellow, and, blue, conceived, as, generic, colors, instead, of, the, three, color, attributes, generally, considered, by, color, science, hue, colorfulness, and, lightness, these, confusions, are, partly, historical, and, arose, in, scientific, uncertainty, about, color, perception, that, was, not, resolved, until, the, late, 19th, century, when, artistic, notions, were, already, entrenched, they, also, arise, from, the, attempt, to, describe, the, highly, contextual, and, flexible, behavior, of, color, perception, in, terms, of, abstract, color, sensations, that, can, be, generated, equivalently, by, any, visual, media, color, theory, asserts, three, pure, primary, colors, that, can, be, used, to, mix, all, possible, colors, these, are, sometimes, considered, as, red, yellow, and, blue, ryb, or, as, red, green, and, blue, rgb, ostensibly, any, failure, of, specific, paints, or, inks, to, match, this, ideal, performance, is, due, to, the, impurity, or, imperfection, of, the, colorants, in, contrast, modern, color, science, does, not, recognize, universal, primary, colors, no, finite, combination, of, colors, can, produce, all, other, colors, and, only, uses, primary, colors, to, define, a, given, color, space, any, three, primary, colors, can, mix, only, a, limited, range, of, colors, called, a, gamut, which, is, always, smaller, contains, fewer, colors, than, the, full, range, of, colors, humans, can, perceive, for, the, mixing, of, colored, light, isaac, newton, s, color, wheel, is, often, used, to, describe, complementary, colors, which, are, colors, that, cancel, each, other, s, hue, to, produce, an, achromatic, white, gray, or, black, light, mixture, newton, offered, as, a, conjecture, that, colors, exactly, opposite, one, another, on, the, hue, circle, cancel, out, each, other, s, hue, this, concept, was, demonstrated, more, thoroughly, in, the, 19th, century, an, example, of, complementary, colors, would, be, magenta, and, green, a, key, assumption, in, newton, s, hue, circle, was, that, the, fiery, or, maximum, saturated, hues, are, located, on, the, outer, circumference, of, the, circle, while, achromatic, white, is, at, the, center, then, the, saturation, of, the, mixture, of, two, spectral, hues, was, predicted, by, the, straight, line, between, them, the, mixture, of, three, colors, was, predicted, by, the, center, of, gravity, or, centroid, of, three, triangle, points, and, so, on, according, to, traditional, color, theory, based, on, subtractive, primary, colors, and, the, ryb, color, model, yellow, mixed, with, purple, orange, mixed, with, blue, or, red, mixed, with, green, produces, an, equivalent, gray, and, are, the, painter, s, complementary, colors, one, reason, the, artist, s, primary, colors, work, at, all, is, due, to, the, imperfect, pigments, being, used, have, sloped, absorption, curves, and, change, color, with, concentration, a, pigment, that, is, pure, red, at, high, concentrations, can, behave, more, like, magenta, at, low, concentrations, this, allows, it, to, make, purples, that, would, otherwise, be, impossible, likewise, a, blue, that, is, ultramarine, at, high, concentrations, appears, cyan, at, low, concentrations, allowing, it, to, be, used, to, mix, green, chromium, red, pigments, can, appear, orange, and, then, yellow, as, the, concentration, is, reduced, it, is, even, possible, to, mix, very, low, concentrations, of, the, blue, mentioned, and, the, chromium, red, to, get, a, greenish, color, this, works, much, better, with, oil, colors, than, it, does, with, watercolors, and, dyes, the, old, primaries, depend, on, sloped, absorption, curves, and, pigment, leakages, to, work, while, newer, scientifically, derived, ones, depend, solely, on, controlling, the, amount, of, absorption, in, certain, parts, of, the, spectrum, when, mixing, pigments, a, color, is, produced, which, is, always, darker, and, lower, in, chroma, or, saturation, than, the, parent, colors, this, moves, the, mixed, color, toward, a, neutral, color, a, gray, or, near, black, lights, are, made, brighter, or, dimmer, by, adjusting, their, brightness, or, energy, level, in, painting, lightness, is, adjusted, through, mixture, with, white, black, or, a, color, s, complement, it, is, common, among, some, painters, to, darken, a, paint, color, by, adding, black, paint, producing, colors, called, shades, or, lighten, a, color, by, adding, white, producing, colors, called, tints, however, it, is, not, always, the, best, way, for, representational, painting, as, an, unfortunate, result, is, for, colors, to, also, shift, in, hue, for, instance, darkening, a, color, by, adding, black, can, cause, colors, such, as, yellows, reds, and, oranges, to, shift, toward, the, greenish, or, bluish, part, of, the, spectrum, lightening, a, color, by, adding, white, can, cause, a, shift, towards, blue, when, mixed, with, reds, and, oranges, another, practice, when, darkening, a, color, is, to, use, its, opposite, or, complementary, color, e, g, purplish, red, added, to, yellowish, green, to, neutralize, it, without, a, shift, in, hue, and, darken, it, if, the, additive, color, is, darker, than, the, parent, color, when, lightening, a, color, this, hue, shift, can, be, corrected, with, the, addition, of, a, small, amount, of, an, adjacent, color, to, bring, the, hue, of, the, mixture, back, in, line, with, the, parent, color, e, g, adding, a, small, amount, of, orange, to, a, mixture, of, red, and, white, will, correct, the, tendency, of, this, mixture, to, shift, slightly, towards, the, blue, end, of, the, spectrum, the, split, primary, palette, is, a, color, wheel, model, that, relies, on, misconceptions, to, attempt, to, explain, the, unsatisfactory, results, produced, when, mixing, the, traditional, primary, colors, red, yellow, and, blue, painters, have, long, considered, red, yellow, and, blue, to, be, primary, colors, in, practice, however, some, of, the, mixtures, produced, from, these, colors, lack, chromatic, intensity, rather, than, adopt, a, more, effective, set, of, primary, colors, proponents, of, split, primary, theory, explain, this, lack, of, chroma, by, the, purported, presence, of, impurities, small, amounts, of, other, colors, in, the, paints, or, biases, away, from, the, ideal, primary, toward, one, or, the, other, of, the, adjacent, colors, every, red, paint, for, example, is, said, to, be, tainted, with, or, biased, toward, either, blue, or, yellow, every, blue, paint, toward, either, red, or, green, and, every, yellow, toward, either, green, or, orange, these, biases, are, said, to, result, in, mixtures, that, contain, sets, of, complementary, colors, darkening, the, resulting, color, to, obtain, vivid, mixed, colors, according, to, split, primary, theory, it, is, necessary, to, employ, two, primary, colors, whose, biases, both, fall, in, the, direction, on, the, color, wheel, of, the, color, to, be, mixed, combining, for, example, green, biased, blue, and, green, biased, yellow, to, make, bright, green, based, on, this, reasoning, proponents, of, split, primary, theory, conclude, that, two, versions, of, each, primary, color, often, called, cool, and, warm, are, needed, in, order, to, mix, a, wide, gamut, of, high, chroma, colors, in, fact, the, perceived, bias, of, colors, is, not, due, to, impurity, rather, the, appearance, of, any, given, colorant, is, inherent, to, its, chemical, and, physical, properties, and, its, purity, unrelated, to, whether, it, conforms, to, our, arbitrary, conception, of, an, ideal, hue, moreover, the, identity, of, gamut, optimizing, primary, colors, is, determined, by, the, physiology, of, human, color, vision, although, no, set, of, three, primary, paints, can, be, mixed, to, obtain, the, complete, color, gamut, perceived, by, humans, red, yellow, and, blue, are, a, poor, choice, if, high, chroma, mixtures, are, desired, this, is, because, painting, is, a, subtractive, color, process, for, which, red, and, blue, are, secondary, not, primary, colors, although, flawed, in, principle, the, split, primary, system, can, be, successful, in, practice, because, the, recommended, blue, biased, red, and, green, biased, blue, positions, are, often, filled, by, near, approximations, of, magenta, and, cyan, respectively, while, orange, biased, red, and, violet, biased, blue, serve, as, secondary, colors, tending, to, further, widen, the, mixable, gamut, this, system, is, in, effect, a, simplified, version, of, newton, s, geometrical, rule, that, colors, closer, together, on, the, hue, circle, will, produce, more, vibrant, mixtures, a, mixture, produced, from, two, primary, colors, however, will, be, much, more, highly, saturated, than, one, produced, from, two, secondary, colors, even, though, the, pairs, are, the, same, distance, apart, on, the, hue, circle, revealing, the, limitations, of, the, circular, model, in, the, prediction, of, color, mixing, results, for, example, a, mixture, of, magenta, and, cyan, inks, or, paints, will, produce, vivid, blues, and, violets, whereas, a, mixture, of, red, and, blue, inks, or, paints, will, produce, darkened, violets, and, purples, even, though, the, angular, distance, separating, magenta, and, cyan, is, the, same, as, that, separating, red, and, blue, in, chevreul, s, 1839, book, the, principles, of, harmony, and, contrast, of, colours, he, introduced, the, law, of, color, contrast, stating, that, colors, that, appear, together, spatially, or, temporally, will, be, altered, as, if, mixed, with, the, complementary, color, of, the, other, color, functionally, boosting, the, color, contrast, between, them, for, example, a, piece, of, yellow, fabric, placed, on, a, blue, background, will, appear, tinted, orange, because, orange, is, the, complementary, color, to, blue, chevreul, formalized, three, types, of, contrast, the, distinction, between, warm, and, cool, colors, has, been, important, since, at, least, the, late, 18th, century, the, difference, as, traced, by, etymologies, in, the, oxford, english, dictionary, seems, related, to, the, observed, contrast, in, landscape, light, between, the, warm, colors, associated, with, daylight, or, sunset, and, the, cool, colors, associated, with, a, gray, or, overcast, day, warm, colors, are, often, said, to, be, hues, from, red, through, yellow, browns, and, tans, included, cool, colors, are, often, said, to, be, the, hues, from, blue, green, through, blue, violet, most, grays, included, there, is, a, historical, disagreement, about, the, colors, that, anchor, the, polarity, but, 19th, century, sources, put, the, peak, contrast, between, red, orange, and, greenish, blue, color, theory, has, described, perceptual, and, psychological, effects, to, this, contrast, warm, colors, are, said, to, advance, or, appear, more, active, in, a, painting, while, cool, colors, tend, to, recede, used, in, interior, design, or, fashion, warm, colors, are, said, to, arouse, or, stimulate, the, viewer, while, cool, colors, calm, and, relax, most, of, these, effects, to, the, extent, they, are, real, can, be, attributed, to, the, higher, saturation, and, lighter, value, of, warm, pigments, in, contrast, to, cool, pigments, brown, is, a, dark, unsaturated, warm, color, that, few, people, think, of, as, visually, active, or, psychologically, arousing, it, has, been, suggested, that, colors, seen, together, to, produce, a, pleasing, affective, response, are, said, to, be, in, harmony, however, color, harmony, is, a, complex, notion, because, human, responses, to, color, are, both, affective, and, cognitive, involving, emotional, response, and, judgment, hence, our, responses, to, color, and, the, notion, of, color, harmony, is, open, to, the, influence, of, a, range, of, different, factors, these, factors, include, individual, differences, such, as, age, gender, personal, preference, affective, state, etc, as, well, as, cultural, sub, cultural, and, socially, based, differences, which, gives, rise, to, conditioning, and, learned, responses, about, color, in, addition, context, always, has, an, influence, on, responses, about, color, and, the, notion, of, color, harmony, and, this, concept, is, also, influenced, by, temporal, factors, such, as, changing, trends, and, perceptual, factors, such, as, simultaneous, contrast, which, may, impinge, on, human, response, to, color, the, following, conceptual, model, illustrates, this, 21st, century, approach, to, color, harmony, wherein, color, harmony, is, a, function, f, of, the, interaction, between, color, s, col, 1, 2, 3, n, and, the, factors, that, influence, positive, aesthetic, response, to, color, individual, differences, id, such, as, age, gender, personality, and, affective, state, cultural, experiences, ce, the, prevailing, context, cx, which, includes, setting, and, ambient, lighting, intervening, perceptual, effects, p, and, the, effects, of, time, t, in, terms, of, prevailing, social, trends, in, addition, given, that, humans, can, perceive, over, 2, 8, million, different, colors, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, number, of, possible, color, combinations, is, virtually, infinite, thereby, implying, that, predictive, color, harmony, formulae, are, fundamentally, unsound, despite, this, many, color, theorists, have, devised, formulae, principles, or, guidelines, for, color, combination, with, the, aim, being, to, predict, or, specify, positive, aesthetic, response, or, color, harmony, color, wheel, models, have, often, been, used, as, a, basis, for, color, combination, guidelines, and, for, defining, relationships, between, colors, some, theorists, and, artists, believe, juxtapositions, of, complementary, color, will, produce, strong, contrast, a, sense, of, visual, tension, as, well, as, color, harmony, while, others, believe, juxtapositions, of, analogous, colors, will, elicit, a, positive, aesthetic, response, color, combination, guidelines, or, formulas, suggest, that, colors, next, to, each, other, on, the, color, wheel, model, analogous, colors, tend, to, produce, a, single, hued, or, monochromatic, color, experience, and, some, theorists, also, refer, to, these, as, simple, harmonies, in, addition, split, complementary, color, schemes, usually, depict, a, modified, complementary, pair, with, instead, of, the, true, second, color, being, chosen, a, range, of, analogous, hues, around, it, are, chosen, i, e, the, split, complements, of, red, are, blue, green, and, yellow, green, a, triadic, color, scheme, adopts, any, three, colors, approximately, equidistant, around, a, color, wheel, model, feisner, and, mahnke, are, among, a, number, of, authors, who, provide, color, combination, guidelines, in, greater, detail, color, combination, formulae, and, principles, may, provide, some, guidance, but, have, limited, practical, application, this, is, due, to, the, influence, of, contextual, perceptual, and, temporal, factors, which, will, influence, how, color, s, are, perceived, in, any, given, situation, setting, or, context, such, formulae, and, principles, may, be, useful, in, fashion, interior, and, graphic, design, but, much, depends, on, the, tastes, lifestyle, and, cultural, norms, of, the, viewer, or, consumer, black, and, white, have, long, been, known, to, combine, well, with, almost, any, other, colors, black, decreases, the, apparent, saturation, or, brightness, of, colors, paired, with, it, and, white, shows, off, all, hues, to, equal, effect, a, major, underpinning, of, traditional, color, theory, is, that, colors, carry, significant, cultural, symbolism, or, even, have, immutable, universal, meaning, as, early, as, the, ancient, greek, philosophers, many, theorists, have, devised, color, associations, and, linked, particular, connotative, meanings, to, specific, colors, however, connotative, color, associations, and, color, symbolism, tends, to, be, culture, bound, and, may, also, vary, across, different, contexts, and, circumstances, for, example, red, has, many, different, connotative, and, symbolic, meanings, from, exciting, arousing, sensual, romantic, and, feminine, to, a, symbol, of, good, luck, and, also, acts, as, a, signal, of, danger, such, color, associations, tend, to, be, learned, and, do, not, necessarily, hold, irrespective, of, individual, and, cultural, differences, or, contextual, temporal, or, perceptual, factors, it, is, important, to, note, that, while, color, symbolism, and, color, associations, exist, their, existence, does, not, provide, evidential, support, for, color, psychology, or, claims, that, color, has, therapeutic, properties
