the, equivalence, principle, is, the, hypothesis, that, the, observed, equivalence, of, gravitational, and, inertial, mass, is, a, consequence, of, nature, the, weak, form, known, for, centuries, relates, to, masses, of, any, composition, in, free, fall, taking, the, same, trajectories, and, landing, at, identical, times, the, extended, form, by, albert, einstein, requires, special, relativity, to, also, hold, in, free, fall, and, requires, the, weak, equivalence, to, be, valid, everywhere, this, form, was, a, critical, input, for, the, development, of, the, theory, of, general, relativity, the, strong, form, requires, einstein, s, form, to, work, for, stellar, objects, highly, precise, experimental, tests, of, the, principle, limit, possible, deviations, from, equivalence, to, be, very, small, in, classical, mechanics, newton, s, equation, of, motion, in, a, gravitational, field, written, out, in, full, is, very, careful, experiments, have, shown, that, the, inertial, mass, on, the, left, side, and, gravitational, mass, on, the, right, side, are, numerically, equal, and, independent, of, the, material, composing, the, masses, the, equivalence, principle, is, the, hypothesis, that, this, numerical, equality, of, inertial, and, gravitational, mass, is, a, consequence, of, their, fundamental, identity, 32, the, equivalence, principle, can, be, considered, an, extension, of, the, principle, of, relativity, the, principle, that, the, laws, of, physics, are, invariant, under, uniform, motion, an, observer, in, a, windowless, room, cannot, distinguish, between, being, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, and, being, in, a, spaceship, in, deep, space, accelerating, at, 1, g, and, the, laws, of, physics, are, unable, to, distinguish, these, cases, 33, galileo, compared, different, materials, experimentally, to, determine, that, the, acceleration, due, to, gravitation, is, independent, of, the, amount, of, mass, being, accelerated, newton, just, 50, years, after, galileo, developed, the, idea, that, gravitational, and, inertial, mass, were, different, concepts, and, compared, the, periods, of, pendulums, composed, of, different, materials, to, verify, that, these, masses, are, the, same, this, form, of, the, equivalence, principle, became, known, as, weak, equivalence, a, version, of, the, equivalence, principle, consistent, with, special, relativity, was, introduced, by, albert, einstein, in, 1907, when, he, observed, that, identical, physical, laws, are, observed, in, two, systems, one, subject, to, a, constant, gravitational, field, causing, acceleration, and, the, other, subject, to, constant, acceleration, like, a, rocket, far, from, any, gravitational, field, 152, since, the, physical, laws, are, the, same, einstein, assumed, the, gravitational, field, and, the, acceleration, were, physically, equivalent, einstein, stated, this, hypothesis, as, we, assume, the, complete, physical, equivalence, of, a, gravitational, field, and, a, corresponding, acceleration, of, the, reference, system, in, 1911, einstein, demonstrated, the, power, of, the, equivalence, principle, by, using, it, to, predict, that, clocks, run, at, different, rates, in, a, gravitational, potential, and, light, rays, bend, in, a, gravitational, field, 153, he, connected, the, equivalence, principle, to, his, earlier, principle, of, special, relativity, this, assumption, of, exact, physical, equivalence, makes, it, impossible, for, us, to, speak, of, the, absolute, acceleration, of, the, system, of, reference, just, as, the, usual, theory, of, relativity, forbids, us, to, talk, of, the, absolute, velocity, of, a, system, and, it, makes, the, equal, falling, of, all, bodies, in, a, gravitational, field, seem, a, matter, of, course, immediately, after, completing, his, work, 111, on, a, theory, of, gravity, known, as, general, relativity, and, in, later, years, einstein, recalled, the, role, of, the, equivalence, principle, the, breakthrough, came, suddenly, one, day, i, was, sitting, on, a, chair, in, my, patent, office, in, bern, suddenly, a, thought, struck, me, if, a, man, falls, freely, he, would, not, feel, his, weight, i, was, taken, aback, this, simple, thought, experiment, made, a, deep, impression, on, me, this, led, me, to, the, theory, of, gravity, since, einstein, developed, general, relativity, there, was, a, need, to, develop, a, framework, to, test, the, theory, against, other, possible, theories, of, gravity, compatible, with, special, relativity, this, was, developed, by, robert, dicke, as, part, of, his, program, to, test, general, relativity, two, new, principles, were, suggested, the, so, called, einstein, equivalence, principle, and, the, strong, equivalence, principle, each, of, which, assumes, the, weak, equivalence, principle, as, a, starting, point, these, are, discussed, below, three, main, forms, of, the, equivalence, principle, are, in, current, use, weak, galilean, einsteinian, and, strong, 6, some, studies, also, create, finer, divisions, or, slight, alternative, the, weak, equivalence, principle, also, known, as, the, universality, of, free, fall, or, the, galilean, equivalence, principle, can, be, stated, in, many, ways, the, strong, equivalence, principle, a, generalization, of, the, weak, equivalence, principle, includes, astronomic, bodies, with, gravitational, self, binding, energy, instead, the, weak, equivalence, principle, assumes, falling, bodies, are, self, bound, by, non, gravitational, forces, only, e, g, a, stone, either, way, uniformity, of, the, gravitational, field, eliminates, measurable, tidal, forces, originating, from, a, radial, divergent, gravitational, field, e, g, the, earth, upon, finite, sized, physical, bodies, what, is, now, called, the, einstein, equivalence, principle, states, that, the, weak, equivalence, principle, holds, and, that, here, local, means, that, experimental, setup, must, be, small, compared, to, variations, in, the, gravitational, field, called, tidal, forces, the, test, experiment, must, be, small, enough, so, that, its, gravitational, potential, does, not, alter, the, result, the, two, additional, constraints, added, to, the, weak, principle, to, get, the, einstein, form, 1, the, independence, of, the, outcome, on, relative, velocity, local, lorentz, invariance, and, 2, independence, of, where, known, as, local, positional, invariance, have, far, reaching, consequences, with, these, constraints, alone, einstein, was, able, to, predict, the, gravitational, redshift, theories, of, gravity, that, obey, the, einstein, equivalence, principle, must, be, metric, theories, meaning, that, trajectories, of, freely, falling, bodies, are, geodesics, of, symmetric, metric, 9, around, 1960, leonard, i, schiff, conjectured, that, any, complete, and, consistent, theory, of, gravity, that, embodies, the, weak, equivalence, principle, implies, the, einstein, equivalence, principle, the, conjecture, can, t, be, proven, but, has, several, plausibility, arguments, in, its, favor, 20, nonetheless, the, two, principles, are, tested, with, very, different, kinds, of, experiments, the, einstein, equivalence, principle, has, been, criticized, as, imprecise, because, there, is, no, universally, accepted, way, to, distinguish, gravitational, from, non, gravitational, experiments, see, for, instance, hadley, and, durand, the, strong, equivalence, principle, applies, the, same, constraints, as, the, einstein, equivalence, principle, but, allows, the, freely, falling, bodies, to, be, massive, gravitating, objects, as, well, as, test, particles, thus, this, is, a, version, of, the, equivalence, principle, that, applies, to, objects, that, exert, a, gravitational, force, on, themselves, such, as, stars, planets, black, holes, or, cavendish, experiments, it, requires, that, the, gravitational, constant, be, the, same, everywhere, in, the, universe, 49, and, is, incompatible, with, a, fifth, force, it, is, much, more, restrictive, than, the, einstein, equivalence, principle, like, the, einstein, equivalence, principle, the, strong, equivalence, principle, requires, gravity, is, geometrical, by, nature, but, in, addition, it, forbids, any, extra, fields, so, the, metric, alone, determines, all, of, the, effects, of, gravity, if, an, observer, measures, a, patch, of, space, to, be, flat, then, the, strong, equivalence, principle, suggests, that, it, is, absolutely, equivalent, to, any, other, patch, of, flat, space, elsewhere, in, the, universe, einstein, s, theory, of, general, relativity, including, the, cosmological, constant, is, thought, to, be, the, only, theory, of, gravity, that, satisfies, the, strong, equivalence, principle, a, number, of, alternative, theories, such, as, brans, dicke, theory, and, the, einstein, aether, theory, add, additional, fields, some, of, the, tests, of, the, equivalence, principle, use, names, for, the, different, ways, mass, appears, in, physical, formulae, in, nonrelativistic, physics, three, kinds, of, mass, can, be, distinguished, by, definition, of, active, and, passive, gravitational, mass, the, force, on, m, 1, displaystyle, m, 1, due, to, the, gravitational, field, of, m, 0, displaystyle, m, 0, is, f, 1, m, 0, a, c, t, m, 1, p, a, s, s, r, 2, displaystyle, f, 1, frac, m, 0, mathrm, act, m, 1, mathrm, pass, r, 2, likewise, the, force, on, a, second, object, of, arbitrary, mass, 2, due, to, the, gravitational, field, of, mass, 0, is, f, 2, m, 0, a, c, t, m, 2, p, a, s, s, r, 2, displaystyle, f, 2, frac, m, 0, mathrm, act, m, 2, mathrm, pass, r, 2, by, definition, of, inertial, mass, f, m, i, n, e, r, t, a, displaystyle, f, m, mathrm, inert, a, if, m, 1, displaystyle, m, 1, and, m, 2, displaystyle, m, 2, are, the, same, distance, r, displaystyle, r, from, m, 0, displaystyle, m, 0, then, by, the, weak, equivalence, principle, they, fall, at, the, same, rate, i, e, their, accelerations, are, the, same, a, 1, f, 1, m, 1, i, n, e, r, t, a, 2, f, 2, m, 2, i, n, e, r, t, displaystyle, a, 1, frac, f, 1, m, 1, mathrm, inert, a, 2, frac, f, 2, m, 2, mathrm, inert, hence, m, 0, a, c, t, m, 1, p, a, s, s, r, 2, m, 1, i, n, e, r, t, m, 0, a, c, t, m, 2, p, a, s, s, r, 2, m, 2, i, n, e, r, t, displaystyle, frac, m, 0, mathrm, act,

inertial, mass, for, objects, independent, of, their, material, composition, if, the, weak, equivalence, principle, is, obeyed, the, dimensionless, e, tv, s, parameter, or, e, tv, s, ratio, a, b, displaystyle, eta, a, b, is, the, difference, of, the, ratios, of, gravitational, and, inertial, masses, divided, by, their, average, for, the, two, sets, of, test, masses, a, and, b, a, b, 2, m, p,

displaystyle, frac, m, 0, mathrm, act, m, 0, mathrm, pass, frac, m, 1, mathrm, act, m, 1, mathrm, pass, in, words, passive, gravitational, mass, must, be, proportional, to, active, gravitational, mass, for, all, objects, the, difference, s, 0, 1, m, 0, a, c, t, m, 0, p, a, s, s, m, 1, a, c, t, m, 1, p, a, s, s, displaystyle, s, 0, 1, frac, m, 0, mathrm, act, m, 0, mathrm, pass, frac, m, 1, mathrm, act, m, 1, mathrm, pass, is, used, to, quantify, differences, between, passive, and, active, mass, tests, of, the, weak, equivalence, principle, are, those, that, verify, the, equivalence, of, gravitational, mass, and, inertial, mass, an, obvious, test, is, dropping, different, objects, and, verifying, that, they, land, at, the, same, time, historically, this, was, the, first, approach, though, probably, not, by, galileo, s, leaning, tower, of, pisa, experiment, 19, 21, but, earlier, by, simon, stevin, who, dropped, lead, balls, of, different, masses, off, the, delft, churchtower, and, listened, for, the, sound, they, made, on, a, wooden, plank, isaac, newton, measured, the, period, of, pendulums, made, with, different, materials, as, an, alternative, test, giving, the, first, precision, measurements, lor, nd, e, tv, s, s, approach, in, 1908, used, a, very, sensitive, torsion, balance, to, give, precision, approaching, 1, in, a, billion, modern, experiments, have, improved, this, by, another, factor, of, a, million, a, popular, exposition, of, this, measurement, was, done, on, the, moon, by, david, scott, in, 1971, he, dropped, a, falcon, feather, and, a, hammer, at, the, same, time, showing, on, video, that, they, landed, at, the, same, time, experiments, are, still, being, performed, at, the, university, of, washington, which, have, placed, limits, on, the, differential, acceleration, of, objects, towards, the, earth, the, sun, and, towards, dark, matter, in, the, galactic, center, future, satellite, experiments, satellite, test, of, the, equivalence, principle, and, galileo, galilei, will, test, the, weak, equivalence, principle, in, space, to, much, higher, accuracy, with, the, first, successful, production, of, antimatter, in, particular, anti, hydrogen, a, new, approach, to, test, the, weak, equivalence, principle, has, been, proposed, experiments, to, compare, the, gravitational, behavior, of, matter, and, antimatter, are, currently, being, developed, proposals, that, may, lead, to, a, quantum, theory, of, gravity, such, as, string, theory, and, loop, quantum, gravity, predict, violations, of, the, weak, equivalence, principle, because, they, contain, many, light, scalar, fields, with, long, compton, wavelengths, which, should, generate, fifth, forces, and, variation, of, the, fundamental, constants, heuristic, arguments, suggest, that, the, magnitude, of, these, equivalence, principle, violations, could, be, in, the, 10, 13, to, 10, 18, range, currently, envisioned, tests, of, the, weak, equivalence, principle, are, approaching, a, degree, of, sensitivity, such, that, non, discovery, of, a, violation, would, be, just, as, profound, a, result, as, discovery, of, a, violation, non, discovery, of, equivalence, principle, violation, in, this, range, would, suggest, that, gravity, is, so, fundamentally, different, from, other, forces, as, to, require, a, major, reevaluation, of, current, attempts, to, unify, gravity, with, the, other, forces, of, nature, a, positive, detection, on, the, other, hand, would, provide, a, major, guidepost, towards, unification, in, addition, to, the, tests, of, the, weak, equivalence, principle, the, einstein, equivalence, principle, requires, testing, the, local, lorentz, invariance, and, local, positional, invariance, conditions, testing, local, lorentz, invariance, amounts, to, testing, special, relativity, a, theory, with, vast, number, of, existing, tests, 12, nevertheless, attempts, to, look, for, quantum, gravity, require, even, more, precise, tests, the, modern, tests, include, looking, for, directional, variations, in, the, speed, of, light, called, clock, anisotropy, tests, and, new, forms, of, the, michelson, morley, experiment, the, anisotropy, measures, less, than, one, part, in, 10, 20, 14, testing, local, positional, invariance, divides, in, to, tests, in, space, and, in, time, 17, space, based, tests, use, measurements, of, the, gravitational, redshift, the, classic, is, the, pound, rebka, experiment, in, the, 1960s, the, most, precise, measurement, was, done, in, 1976, by, flying, a, hydrogen, maser, and, comparing, it, to, one, on, the, ground, the, global, positioning, system, requires, compensation, for, this, redshift, to, give, accurate, position, values, time, based, tests, search, for, variation, of, dimensionless, constants, and, mass, ratios, for, example, webb, et, al, reported, detection, of, variation, at, the, 10, 5, level, of, the, fine, structure, constant, from, measurements, of, distant, quasars, other, researchers, dispute, these, findings, the, present, best, limits, on, the, variation, of, the, fundamental, constants, have, mainly, been, set, by, studying, the, naturally, occurring, oklo, natural, nuclear, fission, reactor, where, nuclear, reactions, similar, to, ones, we, observe, today, have, been, shown, to, have, occurred, underground, approximately, two, billion, years, ago, these, reactions, are, extremely, sensitive, to, the, values, of, the, fundamental, constants, the, strong, equivalence, principle, can, be, tested, by, 1, finding, orbital, variations, in, massive, bodies, sun, earth, moon, 2, variations, in, the, gravitational, constant, g, depending, on, nearby, sources, of, gravity, or, on, motion, or, 3, searching, for, a, variation, of, newton, s, gravitational, constant, over, the, life, of, the, universe, 47, orbital, variations, due, to, gravitational, self, energy, should, cause, a, polarization, of, solar, system, orbits, called, the, nordtvedt, effect, this, effect, has, been, sensitively, tested, by, the, lunar, laser, ranging, experiment, up, to, the, limit, of, one, part, in, 10, 13, there, is, no, nordtvedt, effect, a, tight, bound, on, the, effect, of, nearby, gravitational, fields, on, the, strong, equivalence, principle, comes, from, modeling, the, orbits, of, binary, stars, and, comparing, the, results, to, pulsar, timing, data, 49, in, 2014, astronomers, discovered, a, stellar, triple, system, containing, a, millisecond, pulsar, psr, j0337, 1715, and, two, white, dwarfs, orbiting, it, the, system, provided, them, a, chance, to, test, the, strong, equivalence, principle, in, a, strong, gravitational, field, with, high, accuracy, most, alternative, theories, of, gravity, predict, a, change, in, the, gravity, constant, over, time, studies, of, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, analysis, of, pulsars, and, the, lunar, laser, ranging, data, have, shown, that, g, cannot, have, varied, by, more, than, 10, since, the, creation, of, the, universe, the, best, data, comes, from, studies, of, the, ephemeris, of, mars, based, on, three, successive, nasa, missions, mars, global, surveyor, mars, odyssey, and, mars, reconnaissance, orbiter, 50
