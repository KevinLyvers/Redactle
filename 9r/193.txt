a, supercluster, is, a, large, group, of, smaller, galaxy, clusters, or, galaxy, groups, they, are, among, the, largest, known, structures, in, the, universe, the, milky, way, is, part, of, the, local, group, galaxy, group, which, contains, more, than, 54, galaxies, which, in, turn, is, part, of, the, virgo, supercluster, which, is, part, of, the, laniakea, supercluster, which, is, part, of, the, pisces, cetus, supercluster, complex, the, large, size, and, low, density, of, superclusters, means, that, they, unlike, clusters, expand, with, the, hubble, expansion, the, number, of, superclusters, in, the, observable, universe, is, estimated, to, be, 10, million, the, existence, of, superclusters, indicates, that, the, galaxies, in, the, universe, are, not, uniformly, distributed, most, of, them, are, drawn, together, in, groups, and, clusters, with, groups, containing, up, to, some, dozens, of, galaxies, and, clusters, up, to, several, thousand, galaxies, those, groups, and, clusters, and, additional, isolated, galaxies, in, turn, form, even, larger, structures, called, superclusters, their, existence, was, first, postulated, by, george, abell, in, his, 1958, abell, catalogue, of, galaxy, clusters, he, called, them, second, order, clusters, or, clusters, of, clusters, superclusters, form, massive, structures, of, galaxies, called, filaments, supercluster, complexes, walls, or, sheets, that, may, span, between, several, hundred, million, light, years, to, 10, billion, light, years, covering, more, than, 5, of, the, observable, universe, these, are, the, largest, structures, known, to, date, observations, of, superclusters, can, give, information, about, the, initial, condition, of, the, universe, when, these, superclusters, were, created, the, directions, of, the, rotational, axes, of, galaxies, within, superclusters, are, studied, by, those, who, believe, that, they, may, give, insight, and, information, into, the, early, formation, process, of, galaxies, in, the, history, of, the, universe, interspersed, among, superclusters, are, large, voids, of, space, where, few, galaxies, exist, superclusters, are, frequently, subdivided, into, groups, of, clusters, called, galaxy, groups, and, clusters, although, superclusters, are, supposed, to, be, the, largest, structures, in, the, universe, according, to, the, cosmological, principle, larger, structures, have, been, observed, in, surveys, including, the, sloan, great, wall, a, 2014, study, indicates, that, the, virgo, supercluster, is, only, a, lobe, of, an, even, greater, supercluster, laniakea, in, 2014, the, newly, announced, laniakea, supercluster, subsumed, the, hydra, centaurus, supercluster, which, became, a, component, of, the, new, supercluster, in, 2014, the, newly, announced, laniakea, supercluster, subsumed, the, pavo, indus, supercluster, which, became, a, component, of, the, new, supercluster, includes, fornax, cluster, s373, dorado, and, eridanus, clouds, length, 652, million, light, years, z, 1, 1, length, 70mpc, z, 0, 42, length, 6mpc
