in, astronomy, the, barycenter, or, barycentre, from, ancient, greek, bar, s, heavy, and, k, ntron, center, is, the, center, of, mass, of, two, or, more, bodies, that, orbit, one, another, and, is, the, point, about, which, the, bodies, orbit, a, barycenter, is, a, dynamical, point, not, a, physical, object, it, is, an, important, concept, in, fields, such, as, astronomy, and, astrophysics, the, distance, from, a, body, s, center, of, mass, to, the, barycenter, can, be, calculated, as, a, two, body, problem, if, one, of, the, two, orbiting, bodies, is, much, more, massive, than, the, other, and, the, bodies, are, relatively, close, to, one, another, the, barycenter, will, typically, be, located, within, the, more, massive, object, in, this, case, rather, than, the, two, bodies, appearing, to, orbit, a, point, between, them, the, less, massive, body, will, appear, to, orbit, about, the, more, massive, body, while, the, more, massive, body, might, be, observed, to, wobble, slightly, this, is, the, case, for, the, earth, moon, system, whose, barycenter, is, located, on, average, 4, 671, km, 2, 902, mi, from, earth, s, center, which, is, 74, of, earth, s, radius, of, 6, 378, km, 3, 963, mi, when, the, two, bodies, are, of, similar, masses, the, barycenter, will, generally, be, located, between, them, and, both, bodies, will, orbit, around, it, this, is, the, case, for, pluto, and, charon, one, of, pluto, s, natural, satellites, as, well, as, for, many, binary, asteroids, and, binary, stars, when, the, less, massive, object, is, far, away, the, barycenter, can, be, located, outside, the, more, massive, object, this, is, the, case, for, jupiter, and, the, sun, despite, the, sun, being, a, thousandfold, more, massive, than, jupiter, their, barycenter, is, slightly, outside, the, sun, due, to, the, relatively, large, distance, between, them, in, astronomy, barycentric, coordinates, are, non, rotating, coordinates, with, the, origin, at, the, barycenter, of, two, or, more, bodies, the, international, celestial, reference, system, icrs, is, a, barycentric, coordinate, system, centered, on, the, solar, system, s, barycenter, the, barycenter, is, one, of, the, foci, of, the, elliptical, orbit, of, each, body, this, is, an, important, concept, in, the, fields, of, astronomy, and, astrophysics, in, a, simple, two, body, case, the, distance, from, the, center, of, the, primary, to, the, barycenter, r, 1, is, given, by, where, the, semi, major, axis, of, the, secondary, s, orbit, r, 2, is, given, by, r, 2, a, r, 1, when, the, barycenter, is, located, within, the, more, massive, body, that, body, will, appear, to, wobble, rather, than, to, follow, a, discernible, orbit, the, following, table, sets, out, some, examples, from, the, solar, system, figures, are, given, rounded, to, three, significant, figures, the, terms, primary, and, secondary, are, used, to, distinguish, between, involved, participants, with, the, larger, being, the, primary, and, the, smaller, being, the, secondary, if, m, 1, m, 2, which, is, true, for, the, sun, and, any, planet, then, the, ratio, r, 1, r, 1, approximates, to, hence, the, barycenter, of, the, sun, planet, system, will, lie, outside, the, sun, only, if, that, is, where, the, planet, is, massive, and, far, from, the, sun, if, jupiter, had, mercury, s, orbit, 57, 900, 000, km, 0, 387, au, the, sun, jupiter, barycenter, would, be, approximately, 55, 000, km, from, the, center, of, the, sun, r, 1, r, 1, 0, 08, but, even, if, the, earth, had, eris, s, orbit, 1, 02, 10, 10, km, 68, au, the, sun, earth, barycenter, would, still, be, within, the, sun, just, over, 30, 000, km, from, the, center, to, calculate, the, actual, motion, of, the, sun, only, the, motions, of, the, four, giant, planets, jupiter, saturn, uranus, neptune, need, to, be, considered, the, contributions, of, all, other, planets, dwarf, planets, etc, are, negligible, if, the, four, giant, planets, were, on, a, straight, line, on, the, same, side, of, the, sun, the, combined, center, of, mass, would, lie, at, about, 1, 17, solar, radii, or, just, over, 810, 000, km, above, the, sun, s, surface, the, calculations, above, are, based, on, the, mean, distance, between, the, bodies, and, yield, the, mean, value, r, 1, but, all, celestial, orbits, are, elliptical, and, the, distance, between, the, bodies, varies, between, the, apses, depending, on, the, eccentricity, e, hence, the, position, of, the, barycenter, varies, too, and, it, is, possible, in, some, systems, for, the, barycenter, to, be, sometimes, inside, and, sometimes, outside, the, more, massive, body, this, occurs, where, the, sun, jupiter, system, with, e, jupiter, 0, 0484, just, fails, to, qualify, 1, 05, 1, 07, 0, 954, in, classical, mechanics, newtonian, gravitation, this, definition, simplifies, calculations, and, introduces, no, known, problems, in, general, relativity, einsteinian, gravitation, complications, arise, because, while, it, is, possible, within, reasonable, approximations, to, define, the, barycenter, we, find, that, the, associated, coordinate, system, does, not, fully, reflect, the, inequality, of, clock, rates, at, different, locations, brumberg, explains, how, to, set, up, barycentric, coordinates, in, general, relativity, the, coordinate, systems, involve, a, world, time, i, e, a, global, time, coordinate, that, could, be, set, up, by, telemetry, individual, clocks, of, similar, construction, will, not, agree, with, this, standard, because, they, are, subject, to, differing, gravitational, potentials, or, move, at, various, velocities, so, the, world, time, must, be, synchronized, with, some, ideal, clock, that, is, assumed, to, be, very, far, from, the, whole, self, gravitating, system, this, time, standard, is, called, barycentric, coordinate, time, tcb, barycentric, osculating, orbital, elements, for, some, objects, in, the, solar, system, are, as, follows, for, objects, at, such, high, eccentricity, barycentric, coordinates, are, more, stable, than, heliocentric, coordinates, for, a, given, epoch, because, the, barycentric, osculating, orbit, is, not, as, greatly, affected, by, where, jupiter, is, on, its, 11, 8, year, orbit
