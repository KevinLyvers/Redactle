eris, minor, planet, designation, 136199, eris, is, the, most, massive, and, second, largest, known, dwarf, planet, in, the, solar, system, it, is, a, trans, neptunian, object, tno, in, the, scattered, disk, and, has, a, high, eccentricity, orbit, eris, was, discovered, in, january, 2005, by, a, palomar, observatory, based, team, led, by, mike, brown, and, verified, later, that, year, it, was, named, in, september, 2006, after, the, greco, roman, goddess, of, strife, and, discord, eris, is, the, ninth, most, massive, known, object, orbiting, the, sun, and, the, sixteenth, most, massive, overall, in, the, solar, system, counting, moons, it, is, also, the, largest, known, object, in, the, solar, system, that, has, not, been, visited, by, a, spacecraft, eris, has, been, measured, at, 2, 326, 12, kilometres, 1, 445, 7, mi, in, diameter, its, mass, is, 0, 28, that, of, the, earth, and, 27, greater, than, that, of, pluto, although, pluto, is, slightly, larger, by, volume, both, eris, and, pluto, have, a, surface, area, that, is, comparable, to, the, area, of, russia, or, south, america, eris, has, one, large, known, moon, dysnomia, in, february, 2016, eris, s, distance, from, the, sun, was, 96, 3, au, 14, 41, billion, km, 8, 95, billion, mi, more, than, three, times, that, of, neptune, or, pluto, with, the, exception, of, long, period, comets, eris, and, dysnomia, were, the, most, distant, known, natural, objects, in, the, solar, system, until, the, discovery, of, 2018, ag, 37, and, 2018, vg, 18, in, 2018, because, eris, appeared, to, be, larger, than, pluto, nasa, initially, described, it, as, the, solar, system, s, tenth, planet, this, along, with, the, prospect, of, other, objects, of, similar, size, being, discovered, in, the, future, motivated, the, international, astronomical, union, iau, to, define, the, term, planet, for, the, first, time, under, the, iau, definition, approved, on, august, 24, 2006, eris, pluto, and, ceres, are, dwarf, planets, reducing, the, number, of, known, planets, in, the, solar, system, to, eight, the, same, as, before, pluto, s, discovery, in, 1930, observations, of, a, stellar, occultation, by, eris, in, 2010, showed, that, it, was, slightly, smaller, than, pluto, which, was, measured, by, new, horizons, as, having, a, mean, diameter, of, 2, 377, 4, kilometres, 1, 477, 2, mi, in, july, 2015, eris, was, discovered, by, the, team, of, mike, brown, chad, trujillo, and, david, rabinowitz, on, january, 5, 2005, from, images, taken, on, october, 21, 2003, the, discovery, was, announced, on, july, 29, 2005, the, same, day, as, makemake, and, two, days, after, haumea, due, in, part, to, events, that, would, later, lead, to, controversy, about, haumea, the, search, team, had, been, systematically, scanning, for, large, outer, solar, system, bodies, for, several, years, and, had, been, involved, in, the, discovery, of, several, other, large, tnos, including, the, dwarf, planets, quaoar, orcus, and, sedna, routine, observations, were, taken, by, the, team, on, october, 21, 2003, using, the, 1, 2, m, samuel, oschin, schmidt, telescope, at, palomar, observatory, california, but, the, image, of, eris, was, not, discovered, at, that, point, due, to, its, very, slow, motion, across, the, sky, the, team, s, automatic, image, searching, software, excluded, all, objects, moving, at, less, than, 1, 5, arcseconds, per, hour, to, reduce, the, number, of, false, positives, returned, when, sedna, was, discovered, in, 2003, it, was, moving, at, 1, 75, arcsec, h, and, in, light, of, that, the, team, reanalyzed, their, old, data, with, a, lower, limit, on, the, angular, motion, sorting, through, the, previously, excluded, images, by, eye, in, january, 2005, the, re, analysis, revealed, eris, s, slow, orbital, motion, against, the, background, stars, follow, up, observations, were, then, carried, out, to, make, a, preliminary, determination, of, eris, s, orbit, which, allowed, the, object, s, distance, to, be, estimated, the, team, had, planned, to, delay, announcing, their, discoveries, of, the, bright, objects, eris, and, makemake, until, further, observations, and, calculations, were, complete, but, announced, them, both, on, july, 29, when, the, discovery, of, another, large, tno, they, had, been, tracking, haumea, was, controversially, announced, on, july, 27, by, a, different, team, in, spain, precovery, images, of, eris, have, been, identified, back, to, september, 3, 1954, more, observations, released, in, october, 2005, revealed, that, eris, has, a, moon, later, named, dysnomia, observations, of, dysnomia, s, orbit, permitted, scientists, to, determine, the, mass, of, eris, which, in, june, 2007, was, calculated, to, be, 1, 66, 0, 02, 10, 22, kg, 27, 2, greater, than, pluto, s, eris, is, named, after, the, greek, goddess, eris, greek, a, personification, of, strife, and, discord, the, name, was, proposed, by, the, caltech, team, on, september, 6, 2006, and, it, was, assigned, on, september, 13, 2006, following, an, unusually, long, period, in, which, the, object, was, known, by, the, provisional, designation, 2003, ub, 313, which, was, granted, automatically, by, the, iau, under, their, naming, protocols, for, minor, planets, the, name, eris, has, two, competing, pronunciations, with, a, long, or, with, a, short, e, analogous, to, the, two, competing, pronunciations, of, the, word, era, perhaps, the, more, common, form, in, english, used, i, a, by, brown, and, his, students, is, r, s, with, disyllabic, laxing, and, a, short, e, however, the, classical, english, pronunciation, of, the, goddess, is, r, s, with, a, long, e, the, greek, and, latin, oblique, stem, of, the, name, is, erid, as, can, be, seen, in, italian, eride, and, russian, erida, so, the, adjective, in, english, is, eridian, r, d, i, n, due, to, uncertainty, over, whether, the, object, would, be, classified, as, a, planet, or, a, minor, planet, because, varying, nomenclature, procedures, apply, to, these, classes, of, objects, the, decision, on, what, to, name, the, object, had, to, wait, until, after, the, august, 24, 2006, iau, ruling, for, a, period, of, time, the, object, became, known, to, the, wider, public, as, xena, xena, was, an, informal, name, used, internally, by, the, discovery, team, inspired, by, the, title, character, of, the, television, series, xena, warrior, princess, the, discovery, team, had, reportedly, saved, the, nickname, xena, for, the, first, body, they, discovered, that, was, larger, than, pluto, according, to, brown, we, chose, it, since, it, started, with, an, x, planet, x, it, sounds, mythological, and, we, ve, been, working, to, get, more, female, deities, out, there, e, g, sedna, also, at, the, time, the, tv, show, was, still, on, tv, which, shows, you, how, long, we, ve, been, searching, brown, said, in, an, interview, that, the, naming, process, was, stalled, one, reporter, called, me, up, from, the, new, york, times, who, happened, to, have, been, a, friend, of, mine, from, college, asked, me, what, s, the, name, you, guys, proposed, and, i, said, well, i, m, not, going, to, tell, and, he, said, well, what, do, you, guys, call, it, when, you, re, just, talking, amongst, yourselves, as, far, as, i, remember, this, was, the, only, time, i, told, anybody, this, in, the, press, and, then, it, got, everywhere, which, i, only, sorta, felt, bad, about, i, kinda, like, the, name, according, to, science, writer, govert, schilling, brown, initially, wanted, to, call, the, object, lila, after, a, concept, in, hindu, mythology, that, described, the, cosmos, as, the, outcome, of, a, game, played, by, brahman, the, name, could, be, pronounced, like, lilah, the, name, of, brown, s, newborn, daughter, brown, was, mindful, of, not, making, his, name, public, before, it, had, been, officially, accepted, he, had, done, so, with, sedna, a, year, previously, and, had, been, heavily, criticized, however, no, objection, was, raised, to, the, sedna, name, other, than, the, breach, of, protocol, and, no, competing, names, were, suggested, for, sedna, he, listed, the, address, of, his, personal, web, page, announcing, the, discovery, as, mbrown, planetlila, and, in, the, chaos, following, the, controversy, over, the, discovery, of, haumea, forgot, to, change, it, rather, than, needlessly, anger, more, of, his, fellow, astronomers, he, simply, said, that, the, webpage, had, been, named, for, his, daughter, and, dropped, lila, from, consideration, brown, had, also, speculated, that, persephone, the, wife, of, the, god, pluto, would, be, a, good, name, for, the, object, the, name, had, been, used, several, times, for, planets, in, science, fiction, and, was, popular, with, the, public, having, handily, won, a, poll, conducted, by, new, scientist, magazine, xena, despite, only, being, a, nickname, came, fourth, this, choice, was, not, possible, because, there, was, already, a, minor, planet, with, that, name, 399, persephone, the, discovery, team, proposed, eris, on, september, 6, 2006, on, september, 13, 2006, this, was, accepted, as, the, official, name, by, the, iau, brown, decided, that, because, the, object, had, been, considered, a, planet, for, so, long, it, deserved, a, name, from, greek, or, roman, mythology, like, the, other, planets, the, asteroids, had, taken, the, vast, majority, of, graeco, roman, names, eris, whom, brown, described, as, his, favorite, goddess, had, fortunately, escaped, inclusion, eris, caused, strife, and, discord, by, causing, quarrels, among, people, said, brown, in, 2006, and, that, s, what, this, one, has, done, too, the, usage, of, planetary, symbols, are, discouraged, in, astronomy, but, nasa, has, used, the, hand, of, eris, u, 2bf0, for, eris, this, is, a, symbol, from, discordianism, a, religion, that, worships, the, goddess, eris, most, astrologers, use, this, symbol, while, some, use, a, symbol, resembling, that, of, mars, but, with, the, arrow, pointing, downward, u, 2bf1, both, symbols, have, been, included, in, unicode, eris, is, a, trans, neptunian, dwarf, planet, its, orbital, characteristics, more, specifically, categorize, it, as, a, scattered, disk, object, sdo, or, a, tno, that, has, been, scattered, from, the, kuiper, belt, into, more, distant, and, unusual, orbits, following, gravitational, interactions, with, neptune, as, the, solar, system, was, forming, although, its, high, orbital, inclination, is, unusual, among, the, known, sdos, theoretical, models, suggest, that, objects, that, were, originally, near, the, inner, edge, of, the, kuiper, belt, were, scattered, into, orbits, with, higher, inclinations, than, objects, from, the, outer, belt, because, eris, was, initially, thought, to, be, larger, than, pluto, it, was, described, as, the, tenth, planet, by, nasa, and, in, media, reports, of, its, discovery, in, response, to, the, uncertainty, over, its, status, and, because, of, ongoing, debate, over, whether, pluto, should, be, classified, as, a, planet, the, iau, delegated, a, group, of, astronomers, to, develop, a, sufficiently, precise, definition, of, the, term, planet, to, decide, the, issue, this, was, announced, as, the, iau, s, definition, of, a, planet, in, the, solar, system, adopted, on, august, 24, 2006, at, this, time, both, eris, and, pluto, were, classified, as, dwarf, planets, a, category, distinct, from, the, new, definition, of, planet, brown, has, since, stated, his, approval, of, this, classification, the, iau, subsequently, added, eris, to, its, minor, planet, catalogue, designating, it, 136199, eris, eris, has, an, orbital, period, of, 559, years, its, maximum, possible, distance, from, the, sun, aphelion, is, 97, 5, au, and, its, closest, perihelion, is, 38, au, as, the, time, of, perihelion, is, defined, at, the, epoch, chosen, using, an, unperturbed, two, body, solution, the, further, the, epoch, is, from, the, date, of, perihelion, the, less, accurate, the, result, numerical, integration, is, required, to, predict, the, time, of, perihelion, accurately, numerical, integration, by, jpl, horizons, shows, that, eris, came, to, perihelion, around, 1699, to, aphelion, around, 1977, and, will, return, to, perihelion, around, december, 2257, unlike, those, of, the, eight, planets, whose, orbits, all, lie, roughly, in, the, same, plane, as, the, earth, s, eris, s, orbit, is, highly, inclined, it, is, tilted, at, an, angle, of, about, 44, degrees, to, the, ecliptic, when, discovered, eris, and, its, moon, were, the, most, distant, known, objects, in, the, solar, system, apart, from, long, period, comets, and, space, probes, it, retained, this, distinction, until, the, discovery, of, 2018, vg, 18, in, 2018, as, of, 2008, there, were, approximately, forty, known, tnos, most, notably, 2006, sq, 372, 2000, oo, 67, and, sedna, that, are, currently, closer, to, the, sun, than, eris, even, though, their, semimajor, axis, is, larger, than, that, of, eris, 67, 8, au, the, eridian, orbit, is, highly, eccentric, and, brings, eris, to, within, 37, 9, au, of, the, sun, a, typical, perihelion, for, scattered, objects, this, is, within, the, orbit, of, pluto, but, still, safe, from, direct, interaction, with, neptune, 37, au, pluto, on, the, other, hand, like, other, plutinos, follows, a, less, inclined, and, less, eccentric, orbit, and, protected, by, orbital, resonance, can, cross, neptune, s, orbit, in, about, 800, years, eris, will, be, closer, to, the, sun, than, pluto, for, some, time, see, the, graph, at, the, left, as, of, 2007, eris, has, an, apparent, magnitude, of, 18, 7, making, it, bright, enough, to, be, detectable, to, some, amateur, telescopes, a, 200, millimetre, 7, 9, in, telescope, with, a, ccd, can, detect, eris, under, favorable, conditions, the, reason, it, had, not, been, noticed, until, now, is, its, steep, orbital, inclination, searches, for, large, outer, solar, system, objects, tend, to, concentrate, on, the, ecliptic, plane, where, most, bodies, are, found, because, of, the, high, inclination, of, its, orbit, eris, passes, through, only, a, few, constellations, of, the, traditional, zodiac, it, is, now, in, the, constellation, cetus, it, was, in, sculptor, from, 1876, until, 1929, and, phoenix, from, roughly, 1840, until, 1875, in, 2036, it, will, enter, pisces, and, stay, there, until, 2065, when, it, will, enter, aries, it, will, then, move, into, the, northern, sky, entering, perseus, in, 2128, and, camelopardalis, where, it, will, reach, its, northernmost, declination, in, 2173, in, november, 2010, eris, was, the, subject, of, one, of, the, most, distant, stellar, occultations, yet, from, earth, preliminary, data, from, this, event, cast, doubt, on, previous, size, estimates, the, teams, announced, their, final, results, from, the, occultation, in, october, 2011, with, an, estimated, diameter, of, 2326, 12, km, this, makes, eris, a, little, smaller, than, pluto, by, area, and, diameter, which, is, 2372, 4, km, across, although, eris, is, more, massive, it, also, indicates, a, geometric, albedo, of, 0, 96, it, is, speculated, that, the, high, albedo, is, due, to, the, surface, ices, being, replenished, because, of, temperature, fluctuations, as, eris, s, eccentric, orbit, takes, it, closer, and, farther, from, the, sun, the, mass, of, eris, can, be, calculated, with, much, greater, precision, based, on, the, accepted, value, for, dysnomia, s, period, at, the, time, 15, 774, days, eris, is, 27, more, massive, than, pluto, using, the, 2011, occultation, results, eris, has, a, density, of, 2, 52, 0, 07, g, cm, 3, substantially, denser, than, pluto, and, thus, must, be, composed, largely, of, rocky, materials, models, of, internal, heating, via, radioactive, decay, suggest, that, eris, could, have, an, subsurface, ocean, of, liquid, water, at, the, mantle, core, boundary, tidal, heating, of, eris, by, its, moon, dysnomia, may, additionally, contribute, to, the, preservation, of, its, possible, subsurface, ocean, more, research, concluded, that, eris, pluto, and, makemake, could, harbor, active, subsurface, oceans, and, show, active, geothermal, activity, in, july, 2015, after, nearly, a, decade, of, eris, being, thought, to, be, the, ninth, largest, known, object, to, directly, orbit, the, sun, close, up, imagery, from, the, new, horizons, mission, determined, the, volume, of, pluto, to, be, slightly, larger, than, that, of, eris, eris, is, now, understood, to, be, the, tenth, largest, known, object, to, directly, orbit, the, sun, by, volume, but, remains, the, ninth, largest, by, mass, the, discovery, team, followed, up, their, initial, identification, of, eris, with, spectroscopic, observations, made, at, the, 8, m, gemini, north, telescope, in, hawaii, on, january, 25, 2005, infrared, light, from, the, object, revealed, the, presence, of, methane, ice, indicating, that, the, surface, may, be, similar, to, that, of, pluto, which, at, the, time, was, the, only, tno, known, to, have, surface, methane, and, of, neptune, s, moon, triton, which, also, has, methane, on, its, surface, in, 2022, near, infrared, spectroscopy, of, eris, by, the, james, webb, space, telescope, jwst, revealed, the, presence, of, deuterated, methane, ice, on, its, surface, at, abundances, lower, than, those, in, jupiter, family, comets, like, 67p, churyumov, gerasimenko, eris, s, comparatively, low, deuterium, abundance, suggests, that, its, methane, is, not, primordial, and, instead, may, have, been, produced, from, subsurface, geochemical, processes, substantial, quantities, of, nitrogen, ice, on, eris, was, also, detected, by, the, jwst, and, it, is, presumed, to, have, originated, from, subsurface, processes, similar, to, eris, s, likely, non, primordial, methane, the, abundance, of, nitrogen, ice, on, eris, is, estimated, to, be, one, third, of, that, of, methane, by, volume, unlike, the, somewhat, reddish, and, variegated, surfaces, of, pluto, and, triton, the, surface, of, eris, appears, almost, white, and, uniform, pluto, s, reddish, color, is, thought, to, be, due, to, deposits, of, tholins, on, its, surface, and, where, these, deposits, darken, the, surface, the, lower, albedo, leads, to, higher, temperatures, and, the, evaporation, of, methane, deposits, in, contrast, eris, is, far, enough, from, the, sun, that, methane, can, condense, onto, its, surface, even, where, the, albedo, is, low, the, condensation, of, methane, uniformly, over, the, surface, reduces, any, albedo, contrasts, and, would, cover, up, any, deposits, of, red, tholins, this, methane, sublimation, and, condensation, cycle, could, produce, bladed, terrain, on, eris, similar, to, those, on, pluto, alternatively, eris, s, surface, could, be, refreshed, through, radiogenic, convection, of, a, global, methane, and, nitrogen, ice, glacier, similar, to, pluto, s, sputnik, planitia, spectroscopic, observations, by, the, jwst, support, the, idea, that, eris, s, surface, is, continually, refreshing, as, no, signs, of, ethane, a, byproduct, of, radiolyzed, methane, were, detected, on, eris, s, surface, due, to, the, distant, and, eccentric, orbit, of, eris, its, surface, temperature, is, estimated, to, vary, from, about, 30, to, 56, k, 243, 2, to, 217, 2, c, 405, 7, to, 358, 9, f, even, though, eris, can, be, up, to, three, times, farther, from, the, sun, than, pluto, it, approaches, close, enough, that, some, of, the, ices, on, the, surface, might, warm, enough, to, sublime, to, form, an, atmosphere, because, methane, and, nitrogen, are, both, highly, volatile, their, presence, shows, either, that, eris, has, always, resided, in, the, distant, reaches, of, the, solar, system, where, it, is, cold, enough, for, methane, and, nitrogen, ice, to, persist, or, that, the, celestial, body, has, an, internal, source, to, replenish, gas, that, escapes, from, its, atmosphere, this, contrasts, with, observations, of, another, discovered, tno, haumea, which, reveal, the, presence, of, water, ice, but, not, methane, eris, displays, very, little, variation, in, brightness, as, it, rotates, due, to, its, uniform, surface, making, measurement, of, its, rotation, period, difficult, precise, long, term, monitoring, of, eris, s, brightness, indicates, that, it, is, tidally, locked, to, its, moon, dysnomia, with, a, rotation, period, synchronous, with, the, moon, s, orbital, period, of, 15, 78, earth, days, dysnomia, is, also, tidally, locked, to, eris, which, makes, the, eris, dysnomia, system, the, second, known, case, of, double, synchronous, rotation, after, pluto, and, charon, previous, measurements, of, eris, s, rotation, period, obtained, highly, uncertain, values, ranging, tens, of, hours, to, several, days, due, to, insufficient, long, term, coverage, of, eris, s, rotation, the, axial, tilt, of, eris, has, not, been, measured, but, it, can, be, reasonably, assumed, that, it, is, the, same, as, dysnomia, s, orbital, inclination, which, would, be, about, 78, degrees, with, respect, to, the, ecliptic, if, this, were, the, case, most, of, eris, s, northern, hemisphere, would, be, illuminated, by, sunlight, with, 30, of, the, hemisphere, experiencing, constant, illumination, in, 2018, in, 2005, the, adaptive, optics, team, at, the, keck, telescopes, in, hawaii, carried, out, observations, of, the, four, brightest, tnos, pluto, makemake, haumea, and, eris, using, the, newly, commissioned, laser, guide, star, adaptive, optics, system, images, taken, on, september, 10, revealed, a, moon, in, orbit, around, eris, in, keeping, with, the, xena, nickname, already, in, use, for, eris, brown, s, team, nicknamed, the, moon, gabrielle, after, the, television, warrior, princess, s, sidekick, when, eris, received, its, official, name, from, the, iau, the, moon, received, the, name, dysnomia, after, the, greek, goddess, of, lawlessness, who, was, eris, s, daughter, brown, says, he, picked, it, for, similarity, to, his, wife, s, name, diane, the, name, also, retains, an, oblique, reference, to, eris, s, old, informal, name, xena, portrayed, on, television, by, lucy, lawless, though, the, connection, was, unintentional, eris, was, observed, from, afar, by, the, outbound, new, horizons, spacecraft, in, may, 2020, as, part, of, its, extended, mission, following, its, successful, pluto, flyby, in, 2015, although, eris, was, farther, from, new, horizons, 112, au, than, it, was, from, earth, 96, au, the, spacecraft, s, unique, vantage, point, inside, the, kuiper, belt, permitted, observations, of, eris, at, high, phase, angles, that, are, otherwise, unobtainable, from, earth, enabling, the, determination, of, the, light, scattering, properties, and, phase, curve, behavior, of, the, eridian, surface, in, the, 2010s, there, were, multiple, studies, for, follow, on, missions, to, explore, the, kuiper, belt, among, which, eris, was, evaluated, as, a, candidate, it, was, calculated, that, a, flyby, mission, to, eris, would, take, 24, 66, years, using, a, jupiter, gravity, assist, based, on, launch, dates, of, april, 3, 2032, or, april, 7, 2044, eris, would, be, 92, 03, or, 90, 19, au,
