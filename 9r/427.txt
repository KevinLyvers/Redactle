lead, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, pb, from, latin, plumbum, and, atomic, number, 82, it, is, a, heavy, metal, that, is, denser, than, most, common, materials, lead, is, soft, and, malleable, and, also, has, a, relatively, low, melting, point, when, freshly, cut, lead, is, a, shiny, gray, with, a, hint, of, blue, it, tarnishes, to, a, dull, gray, color, when, exposed, to, air, lead, has, the, highest, atomic, number, of, any, stable, element, and, three, of, its, isotopes, are, endpoints, of, major, nuclear, decay, chains, of, heavier, elements, lead, is, a, relatively, unreactive, post, transition, metal, its, weak, metallic, character, is, illustrated, by, its, amphoteric, nature, lead, and, lead, oxides, react, with, acids, and, bases, and, it, tends, to, form, covalent, bonds, compounds, of, lead, are, usually, found, in, the, 2, oxidation, state, rather, than, the, 4, state, common, with, lighter, members, of, the, carbon, group, exceptions, are, mostly, limited, to, organolead, compounds, like, the, lighter, members, of, the, group, lead, tends, to, bond, with, itself, it, can, form, chains, and, polyhedral, structures, since, lead, is, easily, extracted, from, its, ores, prehistoric, people, in, the, near, east, were, aware, of, it, galena, is, a, principal, ore, of, lead, which, often, bears, silver, interest, in, silver, helped, initiate, widespread, extraction, and, use, of, lead, in, ancient, rome, lead, production, declined, after, the, fall, of, rome, and, did, not, reach, comparable, levels, until, the, industrial, revolution, lead, played, a, crucial, role, in, the, development, of, the, printing, press, as, movable, type, could, be, relatively, easily, cast, from, lead, alloys, in, 2014, the, annual, global, production, of, lead, was, about, ten, million, tonnes, over, half, of, which, was, from, recycling, lead, s, high, density, low, melting, point, ductility, and, relative, inertness, to, oxidation, make, it, useful, these, properties, combined, with, its, relative, abundance, and, low, cost, resulted, in, its, extensive, use, in, construction, plumbing, batteries, bullets, shots, weights, solders, pewters, fusible, alloys, lead, paints, leaded, gasoline, and, radiation, shielding, lead, is, a, neurotoxin, that, accumulates, in, soft, tissues, and, bones, it, damages, the, nervous, system, and, interferes, with, the, function, of, biological, enzymes, causing, neurological, disorders, ranging, from, behavioral, problems, to, brain, damage, and, also, affects, general, health, cardiovascular, and, renal, systems, lead, s, toxicity, was, first, documented, by, ancient, greek, and, roman, writers, who, noted, some, of, the, symptoms, of, lead, poisoning, but, became, widely, recognized, in, europe, in, the, late, 19th, century, ad, a, lead, atom, has, 82, electrons, arranged, in, an, electron, configuration, of, 4f, 14, 5d, 10, 6s, 2, 6p, 2, the, sum, of, lead, s, first, and, second, ionization, energies, the, total, energy, required, to, remove, the, two, 6p, electrons, is, close, to, that, of, tin, lead, s, upper, neighbor, in, the, carbon, group, this, is, unusual, ionization, energies, generally, fall, going, down, a, group, as, an, element, s, outer, electrons, become, more, distant, from, the, nucleus, and, more, shielded, by, smaller, orbitals, the, sum, of, the, first, four, ionization, energies, of, lead, exceeds, that, of, tin, contrary, to, what, periodic, trends, would, predict, this, is, explained, by, relativistic, effects, which, become, significant, in, heavier, atoms, which, contract, s, and, p, orbitals, such, that, lead, s, 6s, electrons, have, larger, binding, energies, than, its, 5s, electrons, a, consequence, is, the, so, called, inert, pair, effect, the, 6s, electrons, of, lead, become, reluctant, to, participate, in, bonding, stabilising, the, 2, oxidation, state, and, making, the, distance, between, nearest, atoms, in, crystalline, lead, unusually, long, lead, s, lighter, carbon, group, congeners, form, stable, or, metastable, allotropes, with, the, tetrahedrally, coordinated, and, covalently, bonded, diamond, cubic, structure, the, energy, levels, of, their, outer, s, and, p, orbitals, are, close, enough, to, allow, mixing, into, four, hybrid, sp, 3, orbitals, in, lead, the, inert, pair, effect, increases, the, separation, between, its, s, and, p, orbitals, and, the, gap, cannot, be, overcome, by, the, energy, that, would, be, released, by, extra, bonds, following, hybridization, rather, than, having, a, diamond, cubic, structure, lead, forms, metallic, bonds, in, which, only, the, p, electrons, are, delocalized, and, shared, between, the, pb, 2, ions, lead, consequently, has, a, face, centered, cubic, structure, like, the, similarly, sized, divalent, metals, calcium, and, strontium, pure, lead, has, a, bright, shiny, gray, appearance, with, a, hint, of, blue, it, tarnishes, on, contact, with, moist, air, and, takes, on, a, dull, appearance, the, hue, of, which, depends, on, the, prevailing, conditions, characteristic, properties, of, lead, include, high, density, malleability, ductility, and, high, resistance, to, corrosion, due, to, passivation, lead, s, close, packed, face, centered, cubic, structure, and, high, atomic, weight, result, in, a, density, of, 11, 34, g, cm, 3, which, is, greater, than, that, of, common, metals, such, as, iron, 7, 87, g, cm, 3, copper, 8, 93, g, cm, 3, and, zinc, 7, 14, g, cm, 3, this, density, is, the, origin, of, the, idiom, to, go, over, like, a, lead, balloon, some, rarer, metals, are, denser, tungsten, and, gold, are, both, at, 19, 3, g, cm, 3, and, osmium, the, densest, metal, known, has, a, density, of, 22, 59, g, cm, 3, almost, twice, that, of, lead, lead, is, a, very, soft, metal, with, a, mohs, hardness, of, 1, 5, it, can, be, scratched, with, a, fingernail, it, is, quite, malleable, and, somewhat, ductile, the, bulk, modulus, of, lead, a, measure, of, its, ease, of, compressibility, is, 45, 8, gpa, in, comparison, that, of, aluminium, is, 75, 2, gpa, copper, 137, 8, gpa, and, mild, steel, 160, 169, gpa, lead, s, tensile, strength, at, 12, 17, mpa, is, low, that, of, aluminium, is, 6, times, higher, copper, 10, times, and, mild, steel, 15, times, higher, it, can, be, strengthened, by, adding, small, amounts, of, copper, or, antimony, the, melting, point, of, lead, at, 327, 5, c, 621, 5, f, is, very, low, compared, to, most, metals, its, boiling, point, of, 1749, c, 3180, f, is, the, lowest, among, the, carbon, group, elements, the, electrical, resistivity, of, lead, at, 20, c, is, 192, nanoohm, meters, almost, an, order, of, magnitude, higher, than, those, of, other, industrial, metals, copper, at, 15, 43, n, m, gold, 20, 51, n, m, and, aluminium, at, 24, 15, n, m, lead, is, a, superconductor, at, temperatures, lower, than, 7, 19, k, this, is, the, highest, critical, temperature, of, all, type, i, superconductors, and, the, third, highest, of, the, elemental, superconductors, natural, lead, consists, of, four, stable, isotopes, with, mass, numbers, of, 204, 206, 207, and, 208, and, traces, of, six, short, lived, radioisotopes, with, mass, numbers, 209, 214, inclusive, the, high, number, of, isotopes, is, consistent, with, lead, s, atomic, number, being, even, lead, has, a, magic, number, of, protons, 82, for, which, the, nuclear, shell, model, accurately, predicts, an, especially, stable, nucleus, lead, 208, has, 126, neutrons, another, magic, number, which, may, explain, why, lead, 208, is, extraordinarily, stable, with, its, high, atomic, number, lead, is, the, heaviest, element, whose, natural, isotopes, are, regarded, as, stable, lead, 208, is, the, heaviest, stable, nucleus, this, distinction, formerly, fell, to, bismuth, with, an, atomic, number, of, 83, until, its, only, primordial, isotope, bismuth, 209, was, found, in, 2003, to, decay, very, slowly, the, four, stable, isotopes, of, lead, could, theoretically, undergo, alpha, decay, to, isotopes, of, mercury, with, a, release, of, energy, but, this, has, not, been, observed, for, any, of, them, their, predicted, half, lives, range, from, 10, 35, to, 10, 189, years, at, least, 10, 25, times, the, current, age, of, the, universe, three, of, the, stable, isotopes, are, found, in, three, of, the, four, major, decay, chains, lead, 206, lead, 207, and, lead, 208, are, the, final, decay, products, of, uranium, 238, uranium, 235, and, thorium, 232, respectively, these, decay, chains, are, called, the, uranium, chain, the, actinium, chain, and, the, thorium, chain, their, isotopic, concentrations, in, a, natural, rock, sample, depends, greatly, on, the, presence, of, these, three, parent, uranium, and, thorium, isotopes, for, example, the, relative, abundance, of, lead, 208, can, range, from, 52, in, normal, samples, to, 90, in, thorium, ores, for, this, reason, the, standard, atomic, weight, of, lead, is, given, to, only, one, decimal, place, as, time, passes, the, ratio, of, lead, 206, and, lead, 207, to, lead, 204, increases, since, the, former, two, are, supplemented, by, radioactive, decay, of, heavier, elements, while, the, latter, is, not, this, allows, for, lead, lead, dating, as, uranium, decays, into, lead, their, relative, amounts, change, this, is, the, basis, for, uranium, lead, dating, lead, 207, exhibits, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, a, property, that, has, been, used, to, study, its, compounds, in, solution, and, solid, state, including, in, the, human, body, apart, from, the, stable, isotopes, which, make, up, almost, all, lead, that, exists, naturally, there, are, trace, quantities, of, a, few, radioactive, isotopes, one, of, them, is, lead, 210, although, it, has, a, half, life, of, only, 22, 2, years, small, quantities, occur, in, nature, because, lead, 210, is, produced, by, a, long, decay, series, that, starts, with, uranium, 238, that, has, been, present, for, billions, of, years, on, earth, lead, 211, 212, and, 214, are, present, in, the, decay, chains, of, uranium, 235, thorium, 232, and, uranium, 238, respectively, so, traces, of, all, three, of, these, lead, isotopes, are, found, naturally, minute, traces, of, lead, 209, arise, from, the, very, rare, cluster, decay, of, radium, 223, one, of, the, daughter, products, of, natural, uranium, 235, and, the, decay, chain, of, neptunium, 237, traces, of, which, are, produced, by, neutron, capture, in, uranium, ores, lead, 213, also, occurs, in, the, decay, chain, of, neptunium, 237, lead, 210, is, particularly, useful, for, helping, to, identify, the, ages, of, samples, by, measuring, its, ratio, to, lead, 206, both, isotopes, are, present, in, a, single, decay, chain, in, total, 43, lead, isotopes, have, been, synthesized, with, mass, numbers, 178, 220, lead, 205, is, the, most, stable, radioisotope, with, a, half, life, of, around, 1, 70, 10, 7, years, the, second, most, stable, is, lead, 202, which, has, a, half, life, of, about, 52, 500, years, longer, than, any, of, the, natural, trace, radioisotopes, bulk, lead, exposed, to, moist, air, forms, a, protective, layer, of, varying, composition, lead, ii, carbonate, is, a, common, constituent, the, sulfate, or, chloride, may, also, be, present, in, urban, or, maritime, settings, this, layer, makes, bulk, lead, effectively, chemically, inert, in, the, air, finely, powdered, lead, as, with, many, metals, is, pyrophoric, and, burns, with, a, bluish, white, flame, fluorine, reacts, with, lead, at, room, temperature, forming, lead, ii, fluoride, the, reaction, with, chlorine, is, similar, but, requires, heating, as, the, resulting, chloride, layer, diminishes, the, reactivity, of, the, elements, molten, lead, reacts, with, the, chalcogens, to, give, lead, ii, chalcogenides, lead, metal, resists, sulfuric, and, phosphoric, acid, but, not, hydrochloric, or, nitric, acid, the, outcome, depends, on, insolubility, and, subsequent, passivation, of, the, product, salt, organic, acids, such, as, acetic, acid, dissolve, lead, in, the, presence, of, oxygen, concentrated, alkalis, dissolves, lead, and, forms, plumbites, lead, shows, two, main, oxidation, states, 4, and, 2, the, tetravalent, state, is, common, for, the, carbon, group, the, divalent, state, is, rare, for, carbon, and, silicon, minor, for, germanium, important, but, not, prevailing, for, tin, and, is, the, more, important, of, the, two, oxidation, states, for, lead, this, is, attributable, to, relativistic, effects, specifically, the, inert, pair, effect, which, manifests, itself, when, there, is, a, large, difference, in, electronegativity, between, lead, and, oxide, halide, or, nitride, anions, leading, to, a, significant, partial, positive, charge, on, lead, the, result, is, a, stronger, contraction, of, the, lead, 6s, orbital, than, is, the, case, for, the, 6p, orbital, making, it, rather, inert, in, ionic, compounds, the, inert, pair, effect, is, less, applicable, to, compounds, in, which, lead, forms, covalent, bonds, with, elements, of, similar, electronegativity, such, as, carbon, in, organolead, compounds, in, these, the, 6s, and, 6p, orbitals, remain, similarly, sized, and, sp, 3, hybridization, is, still, energetically, favorable, lead, like, carbon, is, predominantly, tetravalent, in, such, compounds, there, is, a, relatively, large, difference, in, the, electronegativity, of, lead, ii, at, 1, 87, and, lead, iv, at, 2, 33, this, difference, marks, the, reversal, in, the, trend, of, increasing, stability, of, the, 4, oxidation, state, going, down, the, carbon, group, tin, by, comparison, has, values, of, 1, 80, in, the, 2, oxidation, state, and, 1, 96, in, the, 4, state, lead, ii, compounds, are, characteristic, of, the, inorganic, chemistry, of, lead, even, strong, oxidizing, agents, like, fluorine, and, chlorine, react, with, lead, to, give, only, pbf, 2, and, pbcl, 2, lead, ii, ions, are, usually, colorless, in, solution, and, partially, hydrolyze, to, form, pb, oh, and, finally, 4, in, which, the, hydroxyl, ions, act, as, bridging, ligands, but, are, not, reducing, agents, as, tin, ii, ions, are, techniques, for, identifying, the, presence, of, the, pb, 2, ion, in, water, generally, rely, on, the, precipitation, of, lead, ii, chloride, using, dilute, hydrochloric, acid, as, the, chloride, salt, is, sparingly, soluble, in, water, in, very, dilute, solutions, the, precipitation, of, lead, ii, sulfide, is, instead, achieved, by, bubbling, hydrogen, sulfide, through, the, solution, lead, monoxide, exists, in, two, polymorphs, litharge, pbo, red, and, massicot, pbo, yellow, the, latter, being, stable, only, above, around, 488, c, litharge, is, the, most, commonly, used, inorganic, compound, of, lead, there, is, no, lead, ii, hydroxide, increasing, the, ph, of, solutions, of, lead, ii, salts, leads, to, hydrolysis, and, condensation, lead, commonly, reacts, with, heavier, chalcogens, lead, sulfide, is, a, semiconductor, a, photoconductor, and, an, extremely, sensitive, infrared, radiation, detector, the, other, two, chalcogenides, lead, selenide, and, lead, telluride, are, likewise, photoconducting, they, are, unusual, in, that, their, color, becomes, lighter, going, down, the, group, lead, dihalides, are, well, characterized, this, includes, the, diastatide, and, mixed, halides, such, as, pbfcl, the, relative, insolubility, of, the, latter, forms, a, useful, basis, for, the, gravimetric, determination, of, fluorine, the, difluoride, was, the, first, solid, ionically, conducting, compound, to, be, discovered, in, 1834, by, michael, faraday, the, other, dihalides, decompose, on, exposure, to, ultraviolet, or, visible, light, especially, the, diiodide, many, lead, ii, pseudohalides, are, known, such, as, the, cyanide, cyanate, and, thiocyanate, lead, ii, forms, an, extensive, variety, of, halide, coordination, complexes, such, as, 2, 4, and, the, n, 5, n, chain, anion, lead, ii, sulfate, is, insoluble, in, water, like, the, sulfates, of, other, heavy, divalent, cations, lead, ii, nitrate, and, lead, ii, acetate, are, very, soluble, and, this, is, exploited, in, the, synthesis, of, other, lead, compounds, few, inorganic, lead, iv, compounds, are, known, they, are, only, formed, in, highly, oxidizing, solutions, and, do, not, normally, exist, under, standard, conditions, lead, ii, oxide, gives, a, mixed, oxide, on, further, oxidation, pb, 3, o, 4, it, is, described, as, lead, ii, iv, oxide, or, structurally, 2pbo, pbo, 2, and, is, the, best, known, mixed, valence, lead, compound, lead, dioxide, is, a, strong, oxidizing, agent, capable, of, oxidizing, hydrochloric, acid, to, chlorine, gas, this, is, because, the, expected, pbcl, 4, that, would, be, produced, is, unstable, and, spontaneously, decomposes, to, pbcl, 2, and, cl, 2, analogously, to, lead, monoxide, lead, dioxide, is, capable, of, forming, plumbate, anions, lead, disulfide, and, lead, diselenide, are, only, stable, at, high, pressures, lead, tetrafluoride, a, yellow, crystalline, powder, is, stable, but, less, so, than, the, difluoride, lead, tetrachloride, a, yellow, oil, decomposes, at, room, temperature, lead, tetrabromide, is, less, stable, still, and, the, existence, of, lead, tetraiodide, is, questionable, some, lead, compounds, exist, in, formal, oxidation, states, other, than, 4, or, 2, lead, iii, may, be, obtained, as, an, intermediate, between, lead, ii, and, lead, iv, in, larger, organolead, complexes, this, oxidation, state, is, not, stable, as, both, the, lead, iii, ion, and, the, larger, complexes, containing, it, are, radicals, the, same, applies, for, lead, i, which, can, be, found, in, such, radical, species, numerous, mixed, lead, ii, iv, oxides, are, known, when, pbo, 2, is, heated, in, air, it, becomes, pb, 12, o, 19, at, 293, c, pb, 12, o, 17, at, 351, c, pb, 3, o, 4, at, 374, c, and, finally, pbo, at, 605, c, a, further, sesquioxide, pb, 2, o, 3, can, be, obtained, at, high, pressure, along, with, several, non, stoichiometric, phases, many, of, them, show, defective, fluorite, structures, in, which, some, oxygen, atoms, are, replaced, by, vacancies, pbo, can, be, considered, as, having, such, a, structure, with, every, alternate, layer, of, oxygen, atoms, absent, negative, oxidation, states, can, occur, as, zintl, phases, as, either, free, lead, anions, as, in, ba, 2, pb, with, lead, formally, being, lead, iv, or, in, oxygen, sensitive, ring, shaped, or, polyhedral, cluster, ions, such, as, the, trigonal, bipyramidal, pb, 5, 2, ion, where, two, lead, atoms, are, lead, i, and, three, are, lead, 0, in, such, anions, each, atom, is, at, a, polyhedral, vertex, and, contributes, two, electrons, to, each, covalent, bond, along, an, edge, from, their, sp, 3, hybrid, orbitals, the, other, two, being, an, external, lone, pair, they, may, be, made, in, liquid, ammonia, via, the, reduction, of, lead, by, sodium, lead, can, form, multiply, bonded, chains, a, property, it, shares, with, its, lighter, homologs, in, the, carbon, group, its, capacity, to, do, so, is, much, less, because, the, pb, pb, bond, energy, is, over, three, and, a, half, times, lower, than, that, of, the, c, c, bond, with, itself, lead, can, build, metal, metal, bonds, of, an, order, up, to, three, with, carbon, lead, forms, organolead, compounds, similar, to, but, generally, less, stable, than, typical, organic, compounds, due, to, the, pb, c, bond, being, rather, weak, this, makes, the, organometallic, chemistry, of, lead, far, less, wide, ranging, than, that, of, tin, lead, predominantly, forms, organolead, iv, compounds, even, when, starting, with, inorganic, lead, ii, reactants, very, few, organolead, ii, compounds, are, known, the, most, well, characterized, exceptions, are, pb, 2, and, pb, 5, c, 5, h, 5, 2, the, lead, analog, of, the, simplest, organic, compound, methane, is, plumbane, plumbane, may, be, obtained, in, a, reaction, between, metallic, lead, and, atomic, hydrogen, two, simple, derivatives, tetramethyllead, and, tetraethyllead, are, the, best, known, organolead, compounds, these, compounds, are, relatively, stable, tetraethyllead, only, starts, to, decompose, if, heated, or, if, exposed, to, sunlight, or, ultraviolet, light, with, sodium, metal, lead, readily, forms, an, equimolar, alloy, that, reacts, with, alkyl, halides, to, form, organometallic, compounds, such, as, tetraethyllead, the, oxidizing, nature, of, many, organolead, compounds, is, usefully, exploited, lead, tetraacetate, is, an, important, laboratory, reagent, for, oxidation, in, organic, synthesis, tetraethyllead, once, added, to, automotive, gasoline, was, produced, in, larger, quantities, than, any, other, organometallic, compound, and, is, still, widely, used, in, fuel, for, small, aircraft, other, organolead, compounds, are, less, chemically, stable, for, many, organic, compounds, a, lead, analog, does, not, exist, lead, s, per, particle, abundance, in, the, solar, system, is, 0, 121, ppb, parts, per, billion, this, figure, is, two, and, a, half, times, higher, than, that, of, platinum, eight, times, more, than, mercury, and, seventeen, times, more, than, gold, the, amount, of, lead, in, the, universe, is, slowly, increasing, as, most, heavier, atoms, all, of, which, are, unstable, gradually, decay, to, lead, the, abundance, of, lead, in, the, solar, system, since, its, formation, 4, 5, billion, years, ago, has, increased, by, about, 0, 75, the, solar, system, abundances, table, shows, that, lead, despite, its, relatively, high, atomic, number, is, more, prevalent, than, most, other, elements, with, atomic, numbers, greater, than, 40, primordial, lead, which, comprises, the, isotopes, lead, 204, lead, 206, lead, 207, and, lead, 208, was, mostly, created, as, a, result, of, repetitive, neutron, capture, processes, occurring, in, stars, the, two, main, modes, of, capture, are, the, s, and, r, processes, in, the, s, process, s, is, for, slow, captures, are, separated, by, years, or, decades, allowing, less, stable, nuclei, to, undergo, beta, decay, a, stable, thallium, 203, nucleus, can, capture, a, neutron, and, become, thallium, 204, this, undergoes, beta, decay, to, give, stable, lead, 204, on, capturing, another, neutron, it, becomes, lead, 205, which, has, a, half, life, of, around, 17, million, years, further, captures, result, in, lead, 206, lead, 207, and, lead, 208, on, capturing, another, neutron, lead, 208, becomes, lead, 209, which, quickly, decays, into, bismuth, 209, on, capturing, another, neutron, bismuth, 209, becomes, bismuth, 210, and, this, beta, decays, to, polonium, 210, which, alpha, decays, to, lead, 206, the, cycle, hence, ends, at, lead, 206, lead, 207, lead, 208, and, bismuth, 209, in, the, r, process, r, is, for, rapid, captures, happen, faster, than, nuclei, can, decay, this, occurs, in, environments, with, a, high, neutron, density, such, as, a, supernova, or, the, merger, of, two, neutron, stars, the, neutron, flux, involved, may, be, on, the, order, of, 10, 22, neutrons, per, square, centimeter, per, second, the, r, process, does, not, form, as, much, lead, as, the, s, process, it, tends, to, stop, once, neutron, rich, nuclei, reach, 126, neutrons, at, this, point, the, neutrons, are, arranged, in, complete, shells, in, the, atomic, nucleus, and, it, becomes, harder, to, energetically, accommodate, more, of, them, when, the, neutron, flux, subsides, these, nuclei, beta, decay, into, stable, isotopes, of, osmium, iridium, platinum, lead, is, classified, as, a, chalcophile, under, the, goldschmidt, classification, meaning, it, is, generally, found, combined, with, sulfur, it, rarely, occurs, in, its, native, metallic, form, many, lead, minerals, are, relatively, light, and, over, the, course, of, the, earth, s, history, have, remained, in, the, crust, instead, of, sinking, deeper, into, the, earth, s, interior, this, accounts, for, lead, s, relatively, high, crustal, abundance, of, 14, ppm, it, is, the, 36th, most, abundant, element, in, the, crust, the, main, lead, bearing, mineral, is, galena, pbs, which, is, mostly, found, with, zinc, ores, most, other, lead, minerals, are, related, to, galena, in, some, way, boulangerite, pb, 5, sb, 4, s, 11, is, a, mixed, sulfide, derived, from, galena, anglesite, pbso, 4, is, a, product, of, galena, oxidation, and, cerussite, or, white, lead, ore, pbco, 3, is, a, decomposition, product, of, galena, arsenic, tin, antimony, silver, gold, copper, bismuth, are, common, impurities, in, lead, minerals, world, lead, resources, exceed, two, billion, tons, significant, deposits, are, located, in, australia, china, ireland, mexico, peru, portugal, russia, united, states, global, reserves, resources, that, are, economically, feasible, to, extract, totaled, 88, million, tons, in, 2016, of, which, australia, had, 35, million, china, 17, million, russia, 6, 4, million, typical, background, concentrations, of, lead, do, not, exceed, 0, 1, g, m, 3, in, the, atmosphere, 100, mg, kg, in, soil, 4, mg, kg, in, vegetation, 5, g, l, in, fresh, water, and, seawater, the, modern, english, word, lead, is, of, germanic, origin, it, comes, from, the, middle, english, leed, and, old, english, l, ad, with, the, macron, above, the, e, signifying, that, the, vowel, sound, of, that, letter, is, long, the, old, english, word, is, derived, from, the, hypothetical, reconstructed, proto, germanic, lauda, lead, according, to, linguistic, theory, this, word, bore, descendants, in, multiple, germanic, languages, of, exactly, the, same, meaning, there, is, no, consensus, on, the, origin, of, the, proto, germanic, lauda, one, hypothesis, suggests, it, is, derived, from, proto, indo, european, laudh, lead, capitalization, of, the, vowel, is, equivalent, to, the, macron, another, hypothesis, suggests, it, is, borrowed, from, proto, celtic, loud, io, lead, this, word, is, related, to, the, latin, plumbum, which, gave, the, element, its, chemical, symbol, pb, the, word, loud, io, is, thought, to, be, the, origin, of, proto, germanic, bliwa, which, also, means, lead, from, which, stemmed, the, german, blei, the, name, of, the, chemical, element, is, not, related, to, the, verb, of, the, same, spelling, which, is, derived, from, proto, germanic, laidijan, to, lead, metallic, lead, beads, dating, back, to, 7000, 6500, bc, have, been, found, in, asia, minor, and, may, represent, the, first, example, of, metal, smelting, at, that, time, lead, had, few, if, any, applications, due, to, its, softness, and, dull, appearance, the, major, reason, for, the, spread, of, lead, production, was, its, association, with, silver, which, may, be, obtained, by, burning, galena, a, common, lead, mineral, the, ancient, egyptians, were, the, first, to, use, lead, minerals, in, cosmetics, an, application, that, spread, to, ancient, greece, and, beyond, the, egyptians, had, used, lead, for, sinkers, in, fishing, nets, glazes, glasses, enamels, ornaments, various, civilizations, of, the, fertile, crescent, used, lead, as, a, writing, material, as, coins, and, as, a, construction, material, lead, was, used, by, the, ancient, chinese, as, a, stimulant, as, currency, as, contraceptive, the, indus, valley, civilization, and, the, mesoamericans, used, it, for, making, amulets, and, the, eastern, and, southern, africans, used, lead, in, wire, drawing, because, silver, was, extensively, used, as, a, decorative, material, and, an, exchange, medium, lead, deposits, came, to, be, worked, in, asia, minor, from, 3000, bc, later, lead, deposits, were, developed, in, the, aegean, and, laurion, these, three, regions, collectively, dominated, production, of, mined, lead, until, c, 1200, bc, beginning, c, 2000, bc, the, phoenicians, worked, deposits, in, the, iberian, peninsula, by, 1600, bc, lead, mining, existed, in, cyprus, greece, and, sardinia, rome, s, territorial, expansion, in, europe, and, across, the, mediterranean, and, its, development, of, mining, led, to, it, becoming, the, greatest, producer, of, lead, during, the, classical, era, with, an, estimated, annual, output, peaking, at, 80, 000, tonnes, like, their, predecessors, the, romans, obtained, lead, mostly, as, a, by, product, of, silver, smelting, lead, mining, occurred, in, central, europe, britain, balkans, greece, anatolia, hispania, the, latter, accounting, for, 40, of, world, production, lead, tablets, were, commonly, used, as, a, material, for, letters, lead, coffins, cast, in, flat, sand, forms, and, with, interchangeable, motifs, to, suit, the, faith, of, the, deceased, were, used, in, ancient, judea, lead, was, used, to, make, sling, bullets, from, the, 5th, century, bc, in, roman, times, lead, sling, bullets, were, amply, used, and, were, effective, at, a, distance, of, between, 100, and, 150, meters, the, balearic, slingers, used, as, mercenaries, in, carthaginian, and, roman, armies, were, famous, for, their, shooting, distance, and, accuracy, lead, was, used, for, making, water, pipes, in, the, roman, empire, the, latin, word, for, the, metal, plumbum, is, the, origin, of, the, english, word, plumbing, its, ease, of, working, its, low, melting, point, enabling, the, easy, fabrication, of, completely, waterproof, welded, joints, and, its, resistance, to, corrosion, ensured, its, widespread, use, in, other, applications, including, pharmaceuticals, roofing, currency, warfare, writers, of, the, time, such, as, cato, the, elder, columella, and, pliny, the, elder, recommended, lead, and, lead, coated, vessels, for, the, preparation, of, sweeteners, and, preservatives, added, to, wine, and, food, the, lead, conferred, an, agreeable, taste, due, to, the, formation, of, sugar, of, lead, lead, ii, acetate, whereas, copper, vessels, imparted, a, bitter, flavor, through, verdigris, formation, this, metal, was, by, far, the, most, used, material, in, classical, antiquity, and, it, is, appropriate, to, refer, to, the, roman, lead, age, lead, was, to, the, romans, what, plastic, is, to, us, heinz, eschnauer, and, markus, stoeppler, wine, an, enological, specimen, bank, 1992, the, roman, author, vitruvius, reported, the, health, dangers, of, lead, and, modern, writers, have, suggested, that, lead, poisoning, played, a, major, role, in, the, decline, of, the, roman, empire, other, researchers, have, criticized, such, claims, pointing, out, for, instance, that, not, all, abdominal, pain, is, caused, by, lead, poisoning, according, to, archaeological, research, roman, lead, pipes, increased, lead, levels, in, tap, water, but, such, an, effect, was, unlikely, to, have, been, truly, harmful, when, lead, poisoning, did, occur, victims, were, called, saturnine, dark, and, cynical, after, the, ghoulish, father, of, the, gods, saturn, by, association, lead, was, considered, the, father, of, all, metals, its, status, in, roman, society, was, low, as, it, was, readily, available, and, cheap, since, the, bronze, age, metallurgists, and, engineers, have, understood, the, difference, between, rare, and, valuable, tin, essential, for, alloying, with, copper, to, produce, tough, and, corrosion, resistant, bronze, and, cheap, and, cheerful, lead, however, the, nomenclature, in, some, languages, is, similar, romans, called, lead, plumbum, nigrum, black, lead, and, tin, plumbum, candidum, bright, lead, the, association, of, lead, and, tin, can, be, seen, in, other, languages, the, word, olovo, in, czech, translates, to, lead, but, in, russian, its, cognate, olovo, means, tin, to, add, to, the, confusion, lead, bore, a, close, relation, to, antimony, both, elements, commonly, occur, as, sulfides, galena, and, stibnite, often, together, pliny, incorrectly, wrote, that, stibnite, would, give, lead, on, heating, instead, of, antimony, in, countries, such, as, turkey, and, india, the, originally, persian, name, surma, came, to, refer, to, either, antimony, sulfide, or, lead, sulfide, and, in, some, languages, such, as, russian, gave, its, name, to, antimony, lead, mining, in, western, europe, declined, after, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, with, arabian, iberia, being, the, only, region, having, a, significant, output, the, largest, production, of, lead, occurred, in, south, asia, and, east, asia, especially, china, and, india, where, lead, mining, grew, rapidly, in, europe, lead, production, began, to, increase, in, the, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, when, it, was, again, used, for, roofing, and, piping, starting, in, the, 13th, century, lead, was, used, to, create, stained, glass, in, the, european, and, arabian, traditions, of, alchemy, lead, symbol, in, the, european, tradition, was, considered, an, impure, base, metal, which, by, the, separation, purification, and, balancing, of, its, constituent, essences, could, be, transformed, to, pure, and, incorruptible, gold, during, the, period, lead, was, used, increasingly, for, adulterating, wine, the, use, of, such, wine, was, forbidden, for, use, in, christian, rites, by, a, papal, bull, in, 1498, but, it, continued, to, be, imbibed, and, resulted, in, mass, poisonings, up, to, the, late, 18th, century, lead, was, a, key, material, in, parts, of, the, printing, press, and, lead, dust, was, commonly, inhaled, by, print, workers, causing, lead, poisoning, lead, also, became, the, chief, material, for, making, bullets, for, firearms, it, was, cheap, less, damaging, to, iron, gun, barrels, had, a, higher, density, which, allowed, for, better, retention, of, velocity, and, its, lower, melting, point, made, the, production, of, bullets, easier, as, they, could, be, made, using, a, wood, fire, lead, in, the, form, of, venetian, ceruse, was, extensively, used, in, cosmetics, by, western, european, aristocracy, as, whitened, faces, were, regarded, as, a, sign, of, modesty, this, practice, later, expanded, to, white, wigs, and, eyeliners, and, only, faded, out, with, the, french, revolution, in, the, late, 18th, century, a, similar, fashion, appeared, in, japan, in, the, 18th, century, with, the, emergence, of, the, geishas, a, practice, that, continued, long, into, the, 20th, century, the, white, faces, of, women, came, to, represent, their, feminine, virtue, as, japanese, women, with, lead, commonly, used, in, the, whitener, in, the, new, world, lead, production, was, recorded, soon, after, the, arrival, of, european, settlers, the, earliest, record, dates, to, 1621, in, the, english, colony, of, virginia, fourteen, years, after, its, foundation, in, australia, the, first, mine, opened, by, colonists, on, the, continent, was, a, lead, mine, in, 1841, in, africa, lead, mining, and, smelting, were, known, in, the, benue, trough, and, the, lower, congo, basin, where, lead, was, used, for, trade, with, europeans, and, as, a, currency, by, the, 17th, century, well, before, the, scramble, for, africa, in, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, britain, and, later, continental, europe, and, the, united, states, experienced, the, industrial, revolution, this, was, the, first, time, during, which, lead, production, rates, exceeded, those, of, rome, britain, was, the, leading, producer, losing, this, status, by, the, mid, 19th, century, with, the, depletion, of, its, mines, and, the, development, of, lead, mining, in, germany, spain, and, the, united, states, by, 1900, the, united, states, was, the, leader, in, global, lead, production, and, other, non, european, nations, canada, mexico, and, australia, had, begun, significant, production, production, outside, europe, exceeded, that, within, a, great, share, of, the, demand, for, lead, came, from, plumbing, and, painting, lead, paints, were, in, regular, use, at, this, time, more, working, class, people, were, exposed, to, the, metal, and, lead, poisoning, cases, escalated, this, led, to, research, into, the, effects, of, lead, intake, lead, was, proven, to, be, more, dangerous, in, its, fume, form, than, as, a, solid, metal, lead, poisoning, and, gout, were, linked, british, physician, alfred, baring, garrod, noted, a, third, of, his, gout, patients, were, plumbers, and, painters, the, effects, of, chronic, ingestion, of, lead, including, mental, disorders, were, also, studied, in, the, 19th, century, the, first, laws, aimed, at, decreasing, lead, poisoning, in, factories, were, enacted, during, the, 1870s, and, 1880s, in, the, united, kingdom, further, evidence, of, the, threat, that, lead, posed, to, humans, was, discovered, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, mechanisms, of, harm, were, better, understood, lead, blindness, was, documented, and, the, element, was, phased, out, of, public, use, in, the, united, states, and, europe, the, united, kingdom, introduced, mandatory, factory, inspections, in, 1878, and, appointed, the, first, medical, inspector, of, factories, in, 1898, as, a, result, a, 25, fold, decrease, in, lead, poisoning, incidents, from, 1900, to, 1944, was, reported, most, european, countries, banned, lead, paint, commonly, used, because, of, its, opacity, and, water, resistance, for, interiors, by, 1930, the, last, major, human, exposure, to, lead, was, the, addition, of, tetraethyllead, to, gasoline, as, an, antiknock, agent, a, practice, that, originated, in, the, united, states, in, 1921, it, was, phased, out, in, the, united, states, and, the, european, union, by, 2000, in, the, 1970s, the, united, states, and, western, european, countries, introduced, legislation, to, reduce, lead, air, pollution, the, impact, was, significant, while, a, study, conducted, by, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, in, the, united, states, in, 1976, 1980, showed, that, 77, 8, of, the, population, had, elevated, blood, lead, levels, in, 1991, 1994, a, study, by, the, same, institute, showed, the, share, of, people, with, such, high, levels, dropped, to, 2, 2, the, main, product, made, of, lead, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, was, the, lead, acid, battery, from, 1960, to, 1990, lead, output, in, the, western, bloc, grew, by, about, 31, the, share, of, the, world, s, lead, production, by, the, eastern, bloc, increased, from, 10, to, 30, from, 1950, to, 1990, with, the, soviet, union, being, the, world, s, largest, producer, during, the, mid, 1970s, and, the, 1980s, and, china, starting, major, lead, production, in, the, late, 20th, century, unlike, the, european, communist, countries, china, was, largely, unindustrialized, by, the, mid, 20th, century, in, 2004, china, surpassed, australia, as, the, largest, producer, of, lead, as, was, the, case, during, european, industrialization, lead, has, had, a, negative, effect, on, health, in, china, as, of, 2014, production, of, lead, is, increasing, worldwide, due, to, its, use, in, lead, acid, batteries, there, are, two, major, categories, of, production, primary, from, mined, ores, and, secondary, from, scrap, in, 2014, 4, 58, million, metric, tons, came, from, primary, production, and, 5, 64, million, from, secondary, production, the, top, three, producers, of, mined, lead, concentrate, in, that, year, were, china, australia, and, united, states, the, top, three, producers, of, refined, lead, were, china, united, states, and, india, according, to, the, metal, stocks, in, society, report, of, 2010, the, total, amount, of, lead, in, use, stockpiled, discarded, or, dissipated, into, the, environment, on, a, global, basis, is, 8, kg, per, capita, much, of, this, is, in, more, developed, countries, 20, 150, kg, per, capita, rather, than, less, developed, ones, 1, 4, kg, per, capita, the, primary, and, secondary, lead, production, processes, are, similar, some, primary, production, plants, now, supplement, their, operations, with, scrap, lead, and, this, trend, is, likely, to, increase, in, the, future, given, adequate, techniques, lead, obtained, via, secondary, processes, is, indistinguishable, from, lead, obtained, via, primary, processes, scrap, lead, from, the, building, trade, is, usually, fairly, clean, and, is, re, melted, without, the, need, for, smelting, though, refining, is, sometimes, needed, secondary, lead, production, is, therefore, cheaper, in, terms, of, energy, requirements, than, is, primary, production, often, by, 50, or, more, most, lead, ores, contain, a, low, percentage, of, lead, rich, ores, have, a, typical, content, of, 3, 8, which, must, be, concentrated, for, extraction, during, initial, processing, ores, typically, undergo, crushing, dense, medium, separation, grinding, froth, flotation, drying, the, resulting, concentrate, which, has, a, lead, content, of, 30, 80, by, mass, regularly, 50, 60, is, then, turned, into, impure, lead, metal, there, are, two, main, ways, of, doing, this, a, two, stage, process, involving, roasting, followed, by, blast, furnace, extraction, carried, out, in, separate, vessels, or, a, direct, process, in, which, the, extraction, of, the, concentrate, occurs, in, a, single, vessel, the, latter, has, become, the, most, common, route, though, the, former, is, still, significant, first, the, sulfide, concentrate, is, roasted, in, air, to, oxidize, the, lead, sulfide, as, the, original, concentrate, was, not, pure, lead, sulfide, roasting, yields, not, only, the, desired, lead, ii, oxide, but, a, mixture, of, oxides, sulfates, and, silicates, of, lead, and, of, the, other, metals, contained, in, the, ore, this, impure, lead, oxide, is, reduced, in, a, coke, fired, blast, furnace, to, the, again, impure, metal, impurities, are, mostly, arsenic, antimony, bismuth, zinc, copper, silver, and, gold, typically, they, are, removed, in, a, series, of, pyrometallurgical, processes, the, melt, is, treated, in, a, reverberatory, furnace, with, air, steam, sulfur, which, oxidizes, the, impurities, except, for, silver, gold, bismuth, oxidized, contaminants, float, to, the, top, of, the, melt, and, are, skimmed, off, metallic, silver, and, gold, are, removed, and, recovered, economically, by, means, of, the, parkes, process, in, which, zinc, is, added, to, lead, zinc, which, is, immiscible, in, lead, dissolves, the, silver, and, gold, the, zinc, solution, can, be, separated, from, the, lead, and, the, silver, and, gold, retrieved, de, silvered, lead, is, freed, of, bismuth, by, the, betterton, kroll, process, treating, it, with, metallic, calcium, and, magnesium, the, resulting, bismuth, dross, can, be, skimmed, off, alternatively, to, the, pyrometallurgical, processes, very, pure, lead, can, be, obtained, by, processing, smelted, lead, electrolytically, using, the, betts, process, anodes, of, impure, lead, and, cathodes, of, pure, lead, are, placed, in, an, electrolyte, of, lead, fluorosilicate, pbsif, 6, once, electrical, potential, is, applied, impure, lead, at, the, anode, dissolves, and, plates, onto, the, cathode, leaving, the, majority, of, the, impurities, in, solution, this, is, a, high, cost, process, and, thus, mostly, reserved, for, refining, bullion, containing, high, percentages, of, impurities, in, this, process, lead, bullion, and, slag, is, obtained, directly, from, lead, concentrates, the, lead, sulfide, concentrate, is, melted, in, a, furnace, and, oxidized, forming, lead, monoxide, carbon, as, coke, or, coal, gas, is, added, to, the, molten, charge, along, with, fluxing, agents, the, lead, monoxide, is, thereby, reduced, to, metallic, lead, in, the, midst, of, a, slag, rich, in, lead, monoxide, if, the, input, is, rich, in, lead, as, much, as, 80, of, the, original, lead, can, be, obtained, as, bullion, the, remaining, 20, forms, a, slag, rich, in, lead, monoxide, for, a, low, grade, feed, all, of, the, lead, can, be, oxidized, to, a, high, lead, slag, metallic, lead, is, further, obtained, from, the, high, lead, 25, 40, slags, via, submerged, fuel, combustion, or, injection, reduction, assisted, by, an, electric, furnace, or, a, combination, of, both, research, on, a, cleaner, less, energy, intensive, lead, extraction, process, continues, a, major, drawback, is, that, either, too, much, lead, is, lost, as, waste, or, the, alternatives, result, in, a, high, sulfur, content, in, the, resulting, lead, metal, hydrometallurgical, extraction, in, which, anodes, of, impure, lead, are, immersed, into, an, electrolyte, and, pure, lead, is, deposited, electrowound, onto, cathodes, is, a, technique, that, may, have, potential, but, is, not, currently, economical, except, in, cases, where, electricity, is, very, cheap, smelting, which, is, an, essential, part, of, the, primary, production, is, often, skipped, during, secondary, production, it, is, only, performed, when, metallic, lead, has, undergone, significant, oxidation, the, process, is, similar, to, that, of, primary, production, in, either, a, blast, furnace, or, a, rotary, furnace, with, the, essential, difference, being, the, greater, variability, of, yields, blast, furnaces, produce, hard, lead, 10, antimony, while, reverberatory, and, rotary, kiln, furnaces, produce, semisoft, lead, 3, 4, antimony, the, isasmelt, process, is, a, more, recent, smelting, method, that, may, act, as, an, extension, to, primary, production, battery, paste, from, spent, lead, acid, batteries, containing, lead, sulfate, and, lead, oxides, has, its, sulfate, removed, by, treating, it, with, alkali, and, is, then, treated, in, a, coal, fueled, furnace, in, the, presence, of, oxygen, which, yields, impure, lead, with, antimony, the, most, common, impurity, refining, of, secondary, lead, is, similar, to, that, of, primary, lead, some, refining, processes, may, be, skipped, depending, on, the, material, recycled, and, its, potential, contamination, of, the, sources, of, lead, for, recycling, lead, acid, batteries, are, the, most, important, lead, pipe, sheet, and, cable, sheathing, are, also, significant, contrary, to, popular, belief, pencil, leads, in, wooden, pencils, have, never, been, made, from, lead, when, the, pencil, originated, as, a, wrapped, graphite, writing, tool, the, particular, type, of, graphite, used, was, named, plumbago, literally, lead, mockup, lead, metal, has, several, useful, mechanical, properties, including, high, density, low, melting, point, ductility, and, relative, inertness, many, metals, are, superior, to, lead, in, some, of, these, aspects, but, are, generally, less, common, and, more, difficult, to, extract, from, parent, ores, lead, s, toxicity, has, led, to, its, phasing, out, for, some, uses, lead, has, been, used, for, bullets, since, their, invention, in, the, middle, ages, it, is, inexpensive, its, low, melting, point, means, small, arms, ammunition, and, shotgun, pellets, can, be, cast, with, minimal, technical, equipment, and, it, is, denser, than, other, common, metals, which, allows, for, better, retention, of, velocity, it, remains, the, main, material, for, bullets, alloyed, with, other, metals, as, hardeners, concerns, have, been, raised, that, lead, bullets, used, for, hunting, can, damage, the, environment, in, the, united, states, canada, and, europe, all, shot, pellets, used, for, waterfowl, hunting, must, today, be, lead, free, lead, s, high, density, and, resistance, to, corrosion, have, been, exploited, in, a, number, of, related, applications, it, is, used, as, ballast, in, sailboat, keels, its, density, allows, it, to, take, up, a, small, volume, and, minimize, water, resistance, thus, counterbalancing, the, heeling, effect, of, wind, on, the, sails, it, is, used, in, scuba, diving, weight, belts, to, counteract, the, diver, s, buoyancy, in, 1993, the, base, of, the, leaning, tower, of, pisa, was, stabilized, with, 600, tonnes, of, lead, because, of, its, corrosion, resistance, lead, is, used, as, a, protective, sheath, for, underwater, cables, lead, has, many, uses, in, the, construction, industry, lead, sheets, are, used, as, architectural, metals, in, roofing, material, cladding, flashing, gutters, and, gutter, joints, roof, parapets, lead, is, still, used, in, statues, and, sculptures, including, for, armatures, in, the, past, it, was, often, used, to, balance, the, wheels, of, cars, for, environmental, reasons, this, use, is, being, phased, out, in, favor, of, other, materials, lead, is, added, to, copper, alloys, such, as, brass, and, bronze, to, improve, machinability, and, for, its, lubricating, qualities, being, practically, insoluble, in, copper, the, lead, forms, solid, globules, in, imperfections, throughout, the, alloy, such, as, grain, boundaries, in, low, concentrations, as, well, as, acting, as, a, lubricant, the, globules, hinder, the, formation, of, swarf, as, the, alloy, is, worked, thereby, improving, machinability, copper, alloys, with, larger, concentrations, of, lead, are, used, in, bearings, the, lead, provides, lubrication, and, the, copper, provides, the, load, bearing, support, lead, s, high, density, atomic, number, and, formability,
