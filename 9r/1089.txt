in, physics, sound, is, a, vibration, that, propagates, as, an, acoustic, wave, through, a, transmission, medium, such, as, a, gas, liquid, or, solid, in, human, physiology, and, psychology, sound, is, the, reception, of, such, waves, and, their, perception, by, the, brain, only, acoustic, waves, that, have, frequencies, lying, between, about, 20, hz, and, 20, khz, the, audio, frequency, range, elicit, an, auditory, percept, in, humans, in, air, at, atmospheric, pressure, these, represent, sound, waves, with, wavelengths, of, 17, meters, 56, ft, to, 1, 7, centimeters, 0, 67, in, sound, waves, above, 20, khz, are, known, as, ultrasound, and, are, not, audible, to, humans, sound, waves, below, 20, hz, are, known, as, infrasound, different, animal, species, have, varying, hearing, ranges, sound, is, defined, as, a, oscillation, in, pressure, stress, particle, displacement, particle, velocity, etc, propagated, in, a, medium, with, internal, forces, e, g, elastic, or, viscous, or, the, superposition, of, such, propagated, oscillation, b, auditory, sensation, evoked, by, the, oscillation, described, in, a, sound, can, be, viewed, as, a, wave, motion, in, air, or, other, elastic, media, in, this, case, sound, is, a, stimulus, sound, can, also, be, viewed, as, an, excitation, of, the, hearing, mechanism, that, results, in, the, perception, of, sound, in, this, case, sound, is, a, sensation, acoustics, is, the, interdisciplinary, science, that, deals, with, the, study, of, mechanical, waves, in, gasses, liquids, and, solids, including, vibration, sound, ultrasound, and, infrasound, a, scientist, who, works, in, the, field, of, acoustics, is, an, acoustician, while, someone, working, in, the, field, of, acoustical, engineering, may, be, called, an, acoustical, engineer, an, audio, engineer, on, the, other, hand, is, concerned, with, the, recording, manipulation, mixing, and, reproduction, of, sound, applications, of, acoustics, are, found, in, almost, all, aspects, of, modern, society, subdisciplines, include, aeroacoustics, audio, signal, processing, architectural, acoustics, bioacoustics, electro, acoustics, environmental, noise, musical, acoustics, noise, control, psychoacoustics, speech, ultrasound, underwater, acoustics, and, vibration, sound, can, propagate, through, a, medium, such, as, air, water, and, solids, as, longitudinal, waves, and, also, as, a, transverse, wave, in, solids, the, sound, waves, are, generated, by, a, sound, source, such, as, the, vibrating, diaphragm, of, a, stereo, speaker, the, sound, source, creates, vibrations, in, the, surrounding, medium, as, the, source, continues, to, vibrate, the, medium, the, vibrations, propagate, away, from, the, source, at, the, speed, of, sound, thus, forming, the, sound, wave, at, a, fixed, distance, from, the, source, the, pressure, velocity, and, displacement, of, the, medium, vary, in, time, at, an, instant, in, time, the, pressure, velocity, and, displacement, vary, in, space, the, particles, of, the, medium, do, not, travel, with, the, sound, wave, this, is, intuitively, obvious, for, a, solid, and, the, same, is, true, for, liquids, and, gases, that, is, the, vibrations, of, particles, in, the, gas, or, liquid, transport, the, vibrations, while, the, average, position, of, the, particles, over, time, does, not, change, during, propagation, waves, can, be, reflected, refracted, or, attenuated, by, the, medium, the, behavior, of, sound, propagation, is, generally, affected, by, three, things, when, sound, is, moving, through, a, medium, that, does, not, have, constant, physical, properties, it, may, be, refracted, either, dispersed, or, focused, the, mechanical, vibrations, that, can, be, interpreted, as, sound, can, travel, through, all, forms, of, matter, gases, liquids, solids, and, plasmas, the, matter, that, supports, the, sound, is, called, the, medium, sound, cannot, travel, through, a, vacuum, studies, has, shown, that, sound, waves, are, able, to, carry, a, tiny, amount, of, mass, and, is, surrounded, by, a, weak, gravitational, field, sound, is, transmitted, through, gases, plasma, and, liquids, as, longitudinal, waves, also, called, compression, waves, it, requires, a, medium, to, propagate, through, solids, however, it, can, be, transmitted, as, both, longitudinal, waves, and, transverse, waves, longitudinal, sound, waves, are, waves, of, alternating, pressure, deviations, from, the, equilibrium, pressure, causing, local, regions, of, compression, and, rarefaction, while, transverse, waves, in, solids, are, waves, of, alternating, shear, stress, at, right, angle, to, the, direction, of, propagation, sound, waves, may, be, viewed, using, parabolic, mirrors, and, objects, that, produce, sound, the, energy, carried, by, an, oscillating, sound, wave, converts, back, and, forth, between, the, potential, energy, of, the, extra, compression, in, case, of, longitudinal, waves, or, lateral, displacement, strain, in, case, of, transverse, waves, of, the, matter, and, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, displacement, velocity, of, particles, of, the, medium, although, there, are, many, complexities, relating, to, the, transmission, of, sounds, at, the, point, of, reception, i, e, the, ears, sound, is, readily, dividable, into, two, simple, elements, pressure, and, time, these, fundamental, elements, form, the, basis, of, all, sound, waves, they, can, be, used, to, describe, in, absolute, terms, every, sound, we, hear, in, order, to, understand, the, sound, more, fully, a, complex, wave, such, as, the, one, shown, in, a, blue, background, on, the, right, of, this, text, is, usually, separated, into, its, component, parts, which, are, a, combination, of, various, sound, wave, frequencies, and, noise, sound, waves, are, often, simplified, to, a, description, in, terms, of, sinusoidal, plane, waves, which, are, characterized, by, these, generic, properties, sound, that, is, perceptible, by, humans, has, frequencies, from, about, 20, hz, to, 20, 000, hz, in, air, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, the, corresponding, wavelengths, of, sound, waves, range, from, 17, m, 56, ft, to, 17, mm, 0, 67, in, sometimes, speed, and, direction, are, combined, as, a, velocity, vector, wave, number, and, direction, are, combined, as, a, wave, vector, transverse, waves, also, known, as, shear, waves, have, the, additional, property, polarization, which, is, not, a, characteristic, of, longitudinal, sound, waves, the, speed, of, sound, depends, on, the, medium, the, waves, pass, through, and, is, a, fundamental, property, of, the, material, the, first, significant, effort, towards, measurement, of, the, speed, of, sound, was, made, by, isaac, newton, he, believed, the, speed, of, sound, in, a, particular, substance, was, equal, to, the, square, root, of, the, pressure, acting, on, it, divided, by, its, density, this, was, later, proven, wrong, and, the, french, mathematician, laplace, corrected, the, formula, by, deducing, that, the, phenomenon, of, sound, travelling, is, not, isothermal, as, believed, by, newton, but, adiabatic, he, added, another, factor, to, the, equation, gamma, and, multiplied, displaystyle, sqrt, gamma, by, p, displaystyle, sqrt, p, rho, thus, coming, up, with, the, equation, c, p, displaystyle, c, sqrt, gamma, cdot, p, rho, since, k, p, displaystyle, k, gamma, cdot, p, the, final, equation, came, up, to, be, c, k, displaystyle, c, sqrt, k, rho, which, is, also, known, as, the, newton, laplace, equation, in, this, equation, k, is, the, elastic, bulk, modulus, c, is, the, velocity, of, sound, and, displaystyle, rho, is, the, density, thus, the, speed, of, sound, is, proportional, to, the, square, root, of, the, ratio, of, the, bulk, modulus, of, the, medium, to, its, density, those, physical, properties, and, the, speed, of, sound, change, with, ambient, conditions, for, example, the, speed, of, sound, in, gases, depends, on, temperature, in, 20, c, 68, f, air, at, sea, level, the, speed, of, sound, is, approximately, 343, m, s, 1, 230, km, h, 767, mph, using, the, formula, v, 331, 0, 6, t, the, speed, of, sound, is, also, slightly, sensitive, being, subject, to, a, second, order, anharmonic, effect, to, the, sound, amplitude, which, means, there, are, non, linear, propagation, effects, such, as, the, production, of, harmonics, and, mixed, tones, not, present, in, the, original, sound, see, parametric, array, if, relativistic, effects, are, important, the, speed, of, sound, is, calculated, from, the, relativistic, euler, equations, in, fresh, water, the, speed, of, sound, is, approximately, 1, 482, m, s, 5, 335, km, h, 3, 315, mph, in, steel, the, speed, of, sound, is, about, 5, 960, m, s, 21, 460, km, h, 13, 330, mph, sound, moves, the, fastest, in, solid, atomic, hydrogen, at, about, 36, 000, m, s, 129, 600, km, h, 80, 530, mph, sound, pressure, is, the, difference, in, a, given, medium, between, average, local, pressure, and, the, pressure, in, the, sound, wave, a, square, of, this, difference, i, e, a, square, of, the, deviation, from, the, equilibrium, pressure, is, usually, averaged, over, time, and, or, space, and, a, square, root, of, this, average, provides, a, root, mean, square, rms, value, for, example, 1, pa, rms, sound, pressure, 94, dbspl, in, atmospheric, air, implies, that, the, actual, pressure, in, the, sound, wave, oscillates, between, 1, atm, 2, displaystyle, sqrt, 2, pa, and, 1, atm, 2, displaystyle, sqrt, 2, pa, that, is, between, 101323, 6, and, 101326, 4, pa, as, the, human, ear, can, detect, sounds, with, a, wide, range, of, amplitudes, sound, pressure, is, often, measured, as, a, level, on, a, logarithmic, decibel, scale, the, sound, pressure, level, spl, or, l, p, is, defined, as, since, the, human, ear, does, not, have, a, flat, spectral, response, sound, pressures, are, often, frequency, weighted, so, that, the, measured, level, matches, perceived, levels, more, closely, the, international, electrotechnical, commission, iec, has, defined, several, weighting, schemes, a, weighting, attempts, to, match, the, response, of, the, human, ear, to, noise, and, a, weighted, sound, pressure, levels, are, labeled, dba, c, weighting, is, used, to, measure, peak, levels, a, distinct, use, of, the, term, sound, from, its, use, in, physics, is, that, in, physiology, and, psychology, where, the, term, refers, to, the, subject, of, perception, by, the, brain, the, field, of, psychoacoustics, is, dedicated, to, such, studies, webster, s, dictionary, defined, sound, as, 1, the, sensation, of, hearing, that, which, is, heard, specif, a, psychophysics, sensation, due, to, stimulation, of, the, auditory, nerves, and, auditory, centers, of, the, brain, usually, by, vibrations, transmitted, in, a, material, medium, commonly, air, affecting, the, organ, of, hearing, b, physics, vibrational, energy, which, occasions, such, a, sensation, sound, is, propagated, by, progressive, longitudinal, vibratory, disturbances, sound, waves, this, means, that, the, correct, response, to, the, question, if, a, tree, falls, in, a, forest, and, no, one, is, around, to, hear, it, does, it, make, a, sound, is, yes, and, no, dependent, on, whether, being, answered, using, the, physical, or, the, psychophysical, definition, respectively, the, physical, reception, of, sound, in, any, hearing, organism, is, limited, to, a, range, of, frequencies, humans, normally, hear, sound, frequencies, between, approximately, 20, hz, and, 20, 000, hz, 20, khz, 382, the, upper, limit, decreases, with, age, 249, sometimes, sound, refers, to, only, those, vibrations, with, frequencies, that, are, within, the, hearing, range, for, humans, or, sometimes, it, relates, to, a, particular, animal, other, species, have, different, ranges, of, hearing, for, example, dogs, can, perceive, vibrations, higher, than, 20, khz, as, a, signal, perceived, by, one, of, the, major, senses, sound, is, used, by, many, species, for, detecting, danger, navigation, predation, and, communication, earth, s, atmosphere, water, and, virtually, any, physical, phenomenon, such, as, fire, rain, wind, surf, or, earthquake, produces, and, is, characterized, by, its, unique, sounds, many, species, such, as, frogs, birds, marine, and, terrestrial, mammals, have, also, developed, special, organs, to, produce, sound, in, some, species, these, produce, song, and, speech, furthermore, humans, have, developed, culture, and, technology, such, as, music, telephone, and, radio, that, allows, them, to, generate, record, transmit, and, broadcast, sound, noise, is, a, term, often, used, to, refer, to, an, unwanted, sound, in, science, and, engineering, noise, is, an, undesirable, component, that, obscures, a, wanted, signal, however, in, sound, perception, it, can, often, be, used, to, identify, the, source, of, a, sound, and, is, an, important, component, of, timbre, perception, see, below, soundscape, is, the, component, of, the, acoustic, environment, that, can, be, perceived, by, humans, the, acoustic, environment, is, the, combination, of, all, sounds, whether, audible, to, humans, or, not, within, a, given, area, as, modified, by, the, environment, and, understood, by, people, in, context, of, the, surrounding, environment, there, are, historically, six, experimentally, separable, ways, in, which, sound, waves, are, analysed, they, are, pitch, duration, loudness, timbre, sonic, texture, and, spatial, location, some, of, these, terms, have, a, standardised, definition, for, instance, in, the, ansi, acoustical, terminology, ansi, asa, s1, 1, 2013, more, recent, approaches, have, also, considered, temporal, envelope, and, temporal, fine, structure, as, perceptually, relevant, analyses, pitch, is, perceived, as, how, low, or, high, a, sound, is, and, represents, the, cyclic, repetitive, nature, of, the, vibrations, that, make, up, sound, for, simple, sounds, pitch, relates, to, the, frequency, of, the, slowest, vibration, in, the, sound, called, the, fundamental, harmonic, in, the, case, of, complex, sounds, pitch, perception, can, vary, sometimes, individuals, identify, different, pitches, for, the, same, sound, based, on, their, personal, experience, of, particular, sound, patterns, selection, of, a, particular, pitch, is, determined, by, pre, conscious, examination, of, vibrations, including, their, frequencies, and, the, balance, between, them, specific, attention, is, given, to, recognising, potential, harmonics, every, sound, is, placed, on, a, pitch, continuum, from, low, to, high, for, example, white, noise, random, noise, spread, evenly, across, all, frequencies, sounds, higher, in, pitch, than, pink, noise, random, noise, spread, evenly, across, octaves, as, white, noise, has, more, high, frequency, content, duration, is, perceived, as, how, long, or, short, a, sound, is, and, relates, to, onset, and, offset, signals, created, by, nerve, responses, to, sounds, the, duration, of, a, sound, usually, lasts, from, the, time, the, sound, is, first, noticed, until, the, sound, is, identified, as, having, changed, or, ceased, sometimes, this, is, not, directly, related, to, the, physical, duration, of, a, sound, for, example, in, a, noisy, environment, gapped, sounds, sounds, that, stop, and, start, can, sound, as, if, they, are, continuous, because, the, offset, messages, are, missed, owing, to, disruptions, from, noises, in, the, same, general, bandwidth, this, can, be, of, great, benefit, in, understanding, distorted, messages, such, as, radio, signals, that, suffer, from, interference, as, owing, to, this, effect, the, message, is, heard, as, if, it, was, continuous, loudness, is, perceived, as, how, loud, or, soft, a, sound, is, and, relates, to, the, totalled, number, of, auditory, nerve, stimulations, over, short, cyclic, time, periods, most, likely, over, the, duration, of, theta, wave, cycles, this, means, that, at, short, durations, a, very, short, sound, can, sound, softer, than, a, longer, sound, even, though, they, are, presented, at, the, same, intensity, level, past, around, 200, ms, this, is, no, longer, the, case, and, the, duration, of, the, sound, no, longer, affects, the, apparent, loudness, of, the, sound, timbre, is, perceived, as, the, quality, of, different, sounds, e, g, the, thud, of, a, fallen, rock, the, whir, of, a, drill, the, tone, of, a, musical, instrument, or, the, quality, of, a, voice, and, represents, the, pre, conscious, allocation, of, a, sonic, identity, to, a, sound, e, g, it, s, an, oboe, this, identity, is, based, on, information, gained, from, frequency, transients, noisiness, unsteadiness, perceived, pitch, and, the, spread, and, intensity, of, overtones, in, the, sound, over, an, extended, time, frame, the, way, a, sound, changes, over, time, provides, most, of, the, information, for, timbre, identification, even, though, a, small, section, of, the, wave, form, from, each, instrument, looks, very, similar, differences, in, changes, over, time, between, the, clarinet, and, the, piano, are, evident, in, both, loudness, and, harmonic, content, less, noticeable, are, the, different, noises, heard, such, as, air, hisses, for, the, clarinet, and, hammer, strikes, for, the, piano, sonic, texture, relates, to, the, number, of, sound, sources, and, the, interaction, between, them, the, word, texture, in, this, context, relates, to, the, cognitive, separation, of, auditory, objects, in, music, texture, is, often, referred, to, as, the, difference, between, unison, polyphony, and, homophony, but, it, can, also, relate, for, example, to, a, busy, cafe, a, sound, which, might, be, referred, to, as, cacophony, spatial, location, represents, the, cognitive, placement, of, a, sound, in, an, environmental, context, including, the, placement, of, a, sound, on, both, the, horizontal, and, vertical, plane, the, distance, from, the, sound, source, and, the, characteristics, of, the, sonic, environment, in, a, thick, texture, it, is, possible, to, identify, multiple, sound, sources, using, a, combination, of, spatial, location, and, timbre, identification, ultrasound, is, sound, waves, with, frequencies, higher, than, 20, 000, hz, ultrasound, is, not, different, from, audible, sound, in, its, physical, properties, but, cannot, be, heard, by, humans, ultrasound, devices, operate, with, frequencies, from, 20, khz, up, to, several, gigahertz, medical, ultrasound, is, commonly, used, for, diagnostics, and, treatment, infrasound, is, sound, waves, with, frequencies, lower, than, 20, hz, although, sounds, of, such, low, frequency, are, too, low, for, humans, to, hear, as, a, pitch, these, sound, are, heard, as, discrete, pulses, like, the, popping, sound, of, an, idling, motorcycle, whales, elephants, and, other, animals, can, detect, infrasound, and, use, it, to, communicate, it, can, be, used, to, detect, volcanic, eruptions, and, is, used, in, some, types, of, music
