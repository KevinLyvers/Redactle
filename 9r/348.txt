diamond, is, a, solid, form, of, the, element, carbon, with, its, atoms, arranged, in, a, crystal, structure, called, diamond, cubic, diamond, as, a, form, of, carbon, is, a, tasteless, odourless, strong, brittle, solid, colourless, in, pure, form, a, poor, conductor, of, electricity, and, insoluble, in, water, another, solid, form, of, carbon, known, as, graphite, is, the, chemically, stable, form, of, carbon, at, room, temperature, and, pressure, but, diamond, is, metastable, and, converts, to, it, at, a, negligible, rate, under, those, conditions, diamond, has, the, highest, hardness, and, thermal, conductivity, of, any, natural, material, properties, that, are, used, in, major, industrial, applications, such, as, cutting, and, polishing, tools, they, are, also, the, reason, that, diamond, anvil, cells, can, subject, materials, to, pressures, found, deep, in, the, earth, because, the, arrangement, of, atoms, in, diamond, is, extremely, rigid, few, types, of, impurity, can, contaminate, it, two, exceptions, are, boron, and, nitrogen, small, numbers, of, defects, or, impurities, about, one, per, million, of, lattice, atoms, can, color, a, diamond, blue, boron, yellow, nitrogen, brown, defects, green, radiation, exposure, purple, pink, orange, or, red, diamond, also, has, a, very, high, refractive, index, and, a, relatively, high, optical, dispersion, most, natural, diamonds, have, ages, between, 1, billion, and, 3, 5, billion, years, most, were, formed, at, depths, between, 150, and, 250, kilometres, 93, and, 155, mi, in, the, earth, s, mantle, although, a, few, have, come, from, as, deep, as, 800, kilometres, 500, mi, under, high, pressure, and, temperature, carbon, containing, fluids, dissolved, various, minerals, and, replaced, them, with, diamonds, much, more, recently, hundreds, to, tens, of, million, years, ago, they, were, carried, to, the, surface, in, volcanic, eruptions, and, deposited, in, igneous, rocks, known, as, kimberlites, and, lamproites, synthetic, diamonds, can, be, grown, from, high, purity, carbon, under, high, pressures, and, temperatures, or, from, hydrocarbon, gases, by, chemical, vapor, deposition, cvd, imitation, diamonds, can, also, be, made, out, of, materials, such, as, cubic, zirconia, and, silicon, carbide, natural, synthetic, and, imitation, diamonds, are, most, commonly, distinguished, using, optical, techniques, or, thermal, conductivity, measurements, diamond, is, a, solid, form, of, pure, carbon, with, its, atoms, arranged, in, a, crystal, solid, carbon, comes, in, different, forms, known, as, allotropes, depending, on, the, type, of, chemical, bond, the, two, most, common, allotropes, of, pure, carbon, are, diamond, and, graphite, in, graphite, the, bonds, are, sp, 2, orbital, hybrids, and, the, atoms, form, in, planes, with, each, bound, to, three, nearest, neighbors, 120, degrees, apart, in, diamond, they, are, sp, 3, and, the, atoms, form, tetrahedra, with, each, bound, to, four, nearest, neighbors, tetrahedra, are, rigid, the, bonds, are, strong, and, of, all, known, substances, diamond, has, the, greatest, number, of, atoms, per, unit, volume, which, is, why, it, is, both, the, hardest, and, the, least, compressible, it, also, has, a, high, density, ranging, from, 3150, to, 3530, kilograms, per, cubic, metre, over, three, times, the, density, of, water, in, natural, diamonds, and, 3520, kg, m, 3, in, pure, diamond, in, graphite, the, bonds, between, nearest, neighbors, are, even, stronger, but, the, bonds, between, parallel, adjacent, planes, are, weak, so, the, planes, easily, slip, past, each, other, thus, graphite, is, much, softer, than, diamond, however, the, stronger, bonds, make, graphite, less, flammable, diamonds, have, been, adopted, for, many, uses, because, of, the, material, s, exceptional, physical, characteristics, it, has, the, highest, thermal, conductivity, and, the, highest, sound, velocity, it, has, low, adhesion, and, friction, and, its, coefficient, of, thermal, expansion, is, extremely, low, its, optical, transparency, extends, from, the, far, infrared, to, the, deep, ultraviolet, and, it, has, high, optical, dispersion, it, also, has, high, electrical, resistance, it, is, chemically, inert, not, reacting, with, most, corrosive, substances, and, has, excellent, biological, compatibility, the, equilibrium, pressure, and, temperature, conditions, for, a, transition, between, graphite, and, diamond, are, well, established, theoretically, and, experimentally, the, equilibrium, pressure, varies, linearly, with, temperature, between, 1, 7, gpa, at, 0, k, and, 12, gpa, at, 5000, k, the, diamond, graphite, liquid, triple, point, however, the, phases, have, a, wide, region, about, this, line, where, they, can, coexist, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, 20, c, 293, k, and, 1, standard, atmosphere, 0, 10, mpa, the, stable, phase, of, carbon, is, graphite, but, diamond, is, metastable, and, its, rate, of, conversion, to, graphite, is, negligible, however, at, temperatures, above, about, 4500, k, diamond, rapidly, converts, to, graphite, rapid, conversion, of, graphite, to, diamond, requires, pressures, well, above, the, equilibrium, line, at, 2000, k, a, pressure, of, 35, gpa, is, needed, above, the, graphite, diamond, liquid, carbon, triple, point, the, melting, point, of, diamond, increases, slowly, with, increasing, pressure, but, at, pressures, of, hundreds, of, gpa, it, decreases, at, high, pressures, silicon, and, germanium, have, a, bc8, body, centered, cubic, crystal, structure, and, a, similar, structure, is, predicted, for, carbon, at, high, pressures, at, 0, k, the, transition, is, predicted, to, occur, at, 1100, gpa, results, published, in, an, article, in, the, scientific, journal, nature, physics, in, 2010, suggest, that, at, ultra, high, pressures, and, temperatures, about, 10, million, atmospheres, or, 1, tpa, and, 50, 000, c, diamond, melts, into, a, metallic, fluid, the, extreme, conditions, required, for, this, to, occur, are, present, in, the, ice, giants, neptune, and, uranus, both, planets, are, made, up, of, approximately, 10, percent, carbon, and, could, hypothetically, contain, oceans, of, liquid, carbon, since, large, quantities, of, metallic, fluid, can, affect, the, magnetic, field, this, could, serve, as, an, explanation, as, to, why, the, geographic, and, magnetic, poles, of, the, two, planets, are, unaligned, the, most, common, crystal, structure, of, diamond, is, called, diamond, cubic, it, is, formed, of, unit, cells, see, the, figure, stacked, together, although, there, are, 18, atoms, in, the, figure, each, corner, atom, is, shared, by, eight, unit, cells, and, each, atom, in, the, center, of, a, face, is, shared, by, two, so, there, are, a, total, of, eight, atoms, per, unit, cell, the, length, of, each, side, of, the, unit, cell, is, denoted, by, a, and, is, 3, 567, angstroms, the, nearest, neighbor, distance, in, the, diamond, lattice, is, 1, 732, a, 4, where, a, is, the, lattice, constant, usually, given, in, angstr, ms, as, a, 3, 567, which, is, 0, 3567, nm, a, diamond, cubic, lattice, can, be, thought, of, as, two, interpenetrating, face, centered, cubic, lattices, with, one, displaced, by, 1, 4, of, the, diagonal, along, a, cubic, cell, or, as, one, lattice, with, two, atoms, associated, with, each, lattice, point, viewed, from, a, 1, 1, 1, crystallographic, direction, it, is, formed, of, layers, stacked, in, a, repeating, abcabc, pattern, diamonds, can, also, form, an, abab, structure, which, is, known, as, hexagonal, diamond, or, lonsdaleite, but, this, is, far, less, common, and, is, formed, under, different, conditions, from, cubic, carbon, diamonds, occur, most, often, as, euhedral, or, rounded, octahedra, and, twinned, octahedra, known, as, macles, as, diamond, s, crystal, structure, has, a, cubic, arrangement, of, the, atoms, they, have, many, facets, that, belong, to, a, cube, octahedron, rhombicosidodecahedron, tetrakis, hexahedron, or, disdyakis, dodecahedron, the, crystals, can, have, rounded, off, and, unexpressive, edges, and, can, be, elongated, diamonds, especially, those, with, rounded, crystal, faces, are, commonly, found, coated, in, nyf, an, opaque, gum, like, skin, some, diamonds, contain, opaque, fibers, they, are, referred, to, as, opaque, if, the, fibers, grow, from, a, clear, substrate, or, fibrous, if, they, occupy, the, entire, crystal, their, colors, range, from, yellow, to, green, or, gray, sometimes, with, cloud, like, white, to, gray, impurities, their, most, common, shape, is, cuboidal, but, they, can, also, form, octahedra, dodecahedra, macles, or, combined, shapes, the, structure, is, the, result, of, numerous, impurities, with, sizes, between, 1, and, 5, microns, these, diamonds, probably, formed, in, kimberlite, magma, and, sampled, the, volatiles, diamonds, can, also, form, polycrystalline, aggregates, there, have, been, attempts, to, classify, them, into, groups, with, names, such, as, boart, ballas, stewartite, and, framesite, but, there, is, no, widely, accepted, set, of, criteria, carbonado, a, type, in, which, the, diamond, grains, were, sintered, fused, without, melting, by, the, application, of, heat, and, pressure, is, black, in, color, and, tougher, than, single, crystal, diamond, it, has, never, been, observed, in, a, volcanic, rock, there, are, many, theories, for, its, origin, including, formation, in, a, star, but, no, consensus, diamond, is, the, hardest, material, on, the, qualitative, mohs, scale, to, conduct, the, quantitative, vickers, hardness, test, samples, of, materials, are, struck, with, a, pyramid, of, standardized, dimensions, using, a, known, force, a, diamond, crystal, is, used, for, the, pyramid, to, permit, a, wide, range, of, materials, to, be, tested, from, the, size, of, the, resulting, indentation, a, vickers, hardness, value, for, the, material, can, be, determined, diamond, s, great, hardness, relative, to, other, materials, has, been, known, since, antiquity, and, is, the, source, of, its, name, this, does, not, mean, that, it, is, infinitely, hard, indestructible, or, unscratchable, indeed, diamonds, can, be, scratched, by, other, diamonds, and, worn, down, over, time, even, by, softer, materials, such, as, vinyl, phonograph, records, diamond, hardness, depends, on, its, purity, crystalline, perfection, and, orientation, hardness, is, higher, for, flawless, pure, crystals, oriented, to, the, 111, direction, along, the, longest, diagonal, of, the, cubic, diamond, lattice, therefore, whereas, it, might, be, possible, to, scratch, some, diamonds, with, other, materials, such, as, boron, nitride, the, hardest, diamonds, can, only, be, scratched, by, other, diamonds, and, nanocrystalline, diamond, aggregates, the, hardness, of, diamond, contributes, to, its, suitability, as, a, gemstone, because, it, can, only, be, scratched, by, other, diamonds, it, maintains, its, polish, extremely, well, unlike, many, other, gems, it, is, well, suited, to, daily, wear, because, of, its, resistance, to, scratching, perhaps, contributing, to, its, popularity, as, the, preferred, gem, in, engagement, or, wedding, rings, which, are, often, worn, every, day, the, hardest, natural, diamonds, mostly, originate, from, the, copeton, and, bingara, fields, located, in, the, new, england, area, in, new, south, wales, australia, these, diamonds, are, generally, small, perfect, to, semiperfect, octahedra, and, are, used, to, polish, other, diamonds, their, hardness, is, associated, with, the, crystal, growth, form, which, is, single, stage, crystal, growth, most, other, diamonds, show, more, evidence, of, multiple, growth, stages, which, produce, inclusions, flaws, and, defect, planes, in, the, crystal, lattice, all, of, which, affect, their, hardness, it, is, possible, to, treat, regular, diamonds, under, a, combination, of, high, pressure, and, high, temperature, to, produce, diamonds, that, are, harder, than, the, diamonds, used, in, hardness, gauges, diamonds, cut, glass, but, this, does, not, positively, identify, a, diamond, because, other, materials, such, as, quartz, also, lie, above, glass, on, the, mohs, scale, and, can, also, cut, it, diamonds, can, scratch, other, diamonds, but, this, can, result, in, damage, to, one, or, both, stones, hardness, tests, are, infrequently, used, in, practical, gemology, because, of, their, potentially, destructive, nature, the, extreme, hardness, and, high, value, of, diamond, means, that, gems, are, typically, polished, slowly, using, painstaking, traditional, techniques, and, greater, attention, to, detail, than, is, the, case, with, most, other, gemstones, these, tend, to, result, in, extremely, flat, highly, polished, facets, with, exceptionally, sharp, facet, edges, diamonds, also, possess, an, extremely, high, refractive, index, and, fairly, high, dispersion, taken, together, these, factors, affect, the, overall, appearance, of, a, polished, diamond, and, most, diamantaires, still, rely, upon, skilled, use, of, a, loupe, magnifying, glass, to, identify, diamonds, by, eye, somewhat, related, to, hardness, is, another, mechanical, property, toughness, which, is, a, material, s, ability, to, resist, breakage, from, forceful, impact, the, toughness, of, natural, diamond, has, been, measured, as, 50, 65, mpa, m, 1, 2, this, value, is, good, compared, to, other, ceramic, materials, but, poor, compared, to, most, engineering, materials, such, as, engineering, alloys, which, typically, exhibit, toughness, over, 80, mpa, m, 1, 2, as, with, any, material, the, macroscopic, geometry, of, a, diamond, contributes, to, its, resistance, to, breakage, diamond, has, a, cleavage, plane, and, is, therefore, more, fragile, in, some, orientations, than, others, diamond, cutters, use, this, attribute, to, cleave, some, stones, before, faceting, them, impact, toughness, is, one, of, the, main, indexes, to, measure, the, quality, of, synthetic, industrial, diamonds, diamond, has, compressive, yield, strength, of, 130, 140, gpa, this, exceptionally, high, value, along, with, the, hardness, and, transparency, of, diamond, are, the, reasons, that, diamond, anvil, cells, are, the, main, tool, for, high, pressure, experiments, these, anvils, have, reached, pressures, of, 600, gpa, much, higher, pressures, may, be, possible, with, nanocrystalline, diamonds, usually, attempting, to, deform, bulk, diamond, crystal, by, tension, or, bending, results, in, brittle, fracture, however, when, single, crystalline, diamond, is, in, the, form, of, micro, nanoscale, wires, or, needles, 100, 300, nanometers, in, diameter, micrometers, long, they, can, be, elastically, stretched, by, as, much, as, 9, 10, percent, tensile, strain, without, failure, with, a, maximum, local, tensile, stress, of, about, 89, 98, gpa, very, close, to, the, theoretical, limit, for, this, material, other, specialized, applications, also, exist, or, are, being, developed, including, use, as, semiconductors, some, blue, diamonds, are, natural, semiconductors, in, contrast, to, most, diamonds, which, are, excellent, electrical, insulators, the, conductivity, and, blue, color, originate, from, boron, impurity, boron, substitutes, for, carbon, atoms, in, the, diamond, lattice, donating, a, hole, into, the, valence, band, substantial, conductivity, is, commonly, observed, in, nominally, undoped, diamond, grown, by, chemical, vapor, deposition, this, conductivity, is, associated, with, hydrogen, related, species, adsorbed, at, the, surface, and, it, can, be, removed, by, annealing, or, other, surface, treatments, thin, needles, of, diamond, can, be, made, to, vary, their, electronic, band, gap, from, the, normal, 5, 6, ev, to, near, zero, by, selective, mechanical, deformation, high, purity, diamond, wafers, 5, cm, in, diameter, exhibit, perfect, resistance, in, one, direction, and, perfect, conductance, in, the, other, creating, the, possibility, of, using, them, for, quantum, data, storage, the, material, contains, only, 3, parts, per, million, of, nitrogen, the, diamond, was, grown, on, a, stepped, substrate, which, eliminated, cracking, diamonds, are, naturally, lipophilic, and, hydrophobic, which, means, the, diamonds, surface, cannot, be, wet, by, water, but, can, be, easily, wet, and, stuck, by, oil, this, property, can, be, utilized, to, extract, diamonds, using, oil, when, making, synthetic, diamonds, however, when, diamond, surfaces, are, chemically, modified, with, certain, ions, they, are, expected, to, become, so, hydrophilic, that, they, can, stabilize, multiple, layers, of, water, ice, at, human, body, temperature, the, surface, of, diamonds, is, partially, oxidized, the, oxidized, surface, can, be, reduced, by, heat, treatment, under, hydrogen, flow, that, is, to, say, this, heat, treatment, partially, removes, oxygen, containing, functional, groups, but, diamonds, sp, 3, c, are, unstable, against, high, temperature, above, about, 400, c, 752, f, under, atmospheric, pressure, the, structure, gradually, changes, into, sp, 2, c, above, this, temperature, thus, diamonds, should, be, reduced, below, this, temperature, at, room, temperature, diamonds, do, not, react, with, any, chemical, reagents, including, strong, acids, and, bases, in, an, atmosphere, of, pure, oxygen, diamond, has, an, ignition, point, that, ranges, from, 690, c, 1, 274, f, to, 840, c, 1, 540, f, smaller, crystals, tend, to, burn, more, easily, it, increases, in, temperature, from, red, to, white, heat, and, burns, with, a, pale, blue, flame, and, continues, to, burn, after, the, source, of, heat, is, removed, by, contrast, in, air, the, combustion, will, cease, as, soon, as, the, heat, is, removed, because, the, oxygen, is, diluted, with, nitrogen, a, clear, flawless, transparent, diamond, is, completely, converted, to, carbon, dioxide, any, impurities, will, be, left, as, ash, heat, generated, from, cutting, a, diamond, will, not, ignite, the, diamond, and, neither, will, a, cigarette, lighter, but, house, fires, and, blow, torches, are, hot, enough, jewelers, must, be, careful, when, molding, the, metal, in, a, diamond, ring, diamond, powder, of, an, appropriate, grain, size, around, 50, microns, burns, with, a, shower, of, sparks, after, ignition, from, a, flame, consequently, pyrotechnic, compositions, based, on, synthetic, diamond, powder, can, be, prepared, the, resulting, sparks, are, of, the, usual, red, orange, color, comparable, to, charcoal, but, show, a, very, linear, trajectory, which, is, explained, by, their, high, density, diamond, also, reacts, with, fluorine, gas, above, about, 700, c, 1, 292, f, diamond, has, a, wide, band, gap, of, 5, 5, ev, corresponding, to, the, deep, ultraviolet, wavelength, of, 225, nanometers, this, means, that, pure, diamond, should, transmit, visible, light, and, appear, as, a, clear, colorless, crystal, colors, in, diamond, originate, from, lattice, defects, and, impurities, the, diamond, crystal, lattice, is, exceptionally, strong, and, only, atoms, of, nitrogen, boron, and, hydrogen, can, be, introduced, into, diamond, during, the, growth, at, significant, concentrations, up, to, atomic, percents, transition, metals, nickel, and, cobalt, which, are, commonly, used, for, growth, of, synthetic, diamond, by, high, pressure, high, temperature, techniques, have, been, detected, in, diamond, as, individual, atoms, the, maximum, concentration, is, 0, 01, for, nickel, and, even, less, for, cobalt, virtually, any, element, can, be, introduced, to, diamond, by, ion, implantation, nitrogen, is, by, far, the, most, common, impurity, found, in, gem, diamonds, and, is, responsible, for, the, yellow, and, brown, color, in, diamonds, boron, is, responsible, for, the, blue, color, color, in, diamond, has, two, additional, sources, irradiation, usually, by, alpha, particles, that, causes, the, color, in, green, diamonds, and, plastic, deformation, of, the, diamond, crystal, lattice, plastic, deformation, is, the, cause, of, color, in, some, brown, and, perhaps, pink, and, red, diamonds, in, order, of, increasing, rarity, yellow, diamond, is, followed, by, brown, colorless, then, by, blue, green, black, pink, orange, purple, and, red, black, or, carbonado, diamonds, are, not, truly, black, but, rather, contain, numerous, dark, inclusions, that, give, the, gems, their, dark, appearance, colored, diamonds, contain, impurities, or, structural, defects, that, cause, the, coloration, while, pure, or, nearly, pure, diamonds, are, transparent, and, colorless, most, diamond, impurities, replace, a, carbon, atom, in, the, crystal, lattice, known, as, a, carbon, flaw, the, most, common, impurity, nitrogen, causes, a, slight, to, intense, yellow, coloration, depending, upon, the, type, and, concentration, of, nitrogen, present, the, gemological, institute, of, america, gia, classifies, low, saturation, yellow, and, brown, diamonds, as, diamonds, in, the, normal, color, range, and, applies, a, grading, scale, from, d, colorless, to, z, light, yellow, yellow, diamonds, of, high, color, saturation, or, a, different, color, such, as, pink, or, blue, are, called, fancy, colored, diamonds, and, fall, under, a, different, grading, scale, in, 2008, the, wittelsbach, diamond, a, 35, 56, carat, 7, 112, g, blue, diamond, once, belonging, to, the, king, of, spain, fetched, over, us, 24, million, at, a, christie, s, auction, in, may, 2009, a, 7, 03, carat, 1, 406, g, blue, diamond, fetched, the, highest, price, per, carat, ever, paid, for, a, diamond, when, it, was, sold, at, auction, for, 10, 5, million, swiss, francs, 6, 97, million, euros, or, us, 9, 5, million, at, the, time, that, record, was, however, beaten, the, same, year, a, 5, carat, 1, 0, g, vivid, pink, diamond, was, sold, for, 10, 8, million, in, hong, kong, on, december, 1, 2009, clarity, is, one, of, the, 4c, s, color, clarity, cut, and, carat, weight, that, helps, in, identifying, the, quality, of, diamonds, the, gemological, institute, of, america, gia, developed, 11, clarity, scales, to, decide, the, quality, of, a, diamond, for, its, sale, value, the, gia, clarity, scale, spans, from, flawless, fl, to, included, i, having, internally, flawless, if, very, very, slightly, included, vvs, very, slightly, included, vs, and, slightly, included, si, in, between, impurities, in, natural, diamonds, are, due, to, the, presence, of, natural, minerals, and, oxides, the, clarity, scale, grades, the, diamond, based, on, the, color, size, location, of, impurity, and, quantity, of, clarity, visible, under, 10x, magnification, inclusions, in, diamond, can, be, extracted, by, optical, methods, the, process, is, to, take, pre, enhancement, images, identifying, the, inclusion, removal, part, and, finally, removing, the, diamond, facets, and, noises, between, 25, and, 35, of, natural, diamonds, exhibit, some, degree, of, fluorescence, when, examined, under, invisible, long, wave, ultraviolet, light, or, higher, energy, radiation, sources, such, as, x, rays, and, lasers, incandescent, lighting, will, not, cause, a, diamond, to, fluoresce, diamonds, can, fluoresce, in, a, variety, of, colors, including, blue, most, common, orange, yellow, white, green, and, very, rarely, red, and, purple, although, the, causes, are, not, well, understood, variations, in, the, atomic, structure, such, as, the, number, of, nitrogen, atoms, present, are, thought, to, contribute, to, the, phenomenon, diamonds, can, be, identified, by, their, high, thermal, conductivity, 900, 2320, w, m, 1, k, 1, their, high, refractive, index, is, also, indicative, but, other, materials, have, similar, refractivity, diamonds, are, extremely, rare, with, concentrations, of, at, most, parts, per, billion, in, source, rock, before, the, 20th, century, most, diamonds, were, found, in, alluvial, deposits, loose, diamonds, are, also, found, along, existing, and, ancient, shorelines, where, they, tend, to, accumulate, because, of, their, size, and, density, 149, rarely, they, have, been, found, in, glacial, till, notably, in, wisconsin, and, indiana, but, these, deposits, are, not, of, commercial, quality, 19, these, types, of, deposit, were, derived, from, localized, igneous, intrusions, through, weathering, and, transport, by, wind, or, water, most, diamonds, come, from, the, earth, s, mantle, and, most, of, this, section, discusses, those, diamonds, however, there, are, other, sources, some, blocks, of, the, crust, or, terranes, have, been, buried, deep, enough, as, the, crust, thickened, so, they, experienced, ultra, high, pressure, metamorphism, these, have, evenly, distributed, microdiamonds, that, show, no, sign, of, transport, by, magma, in, addition, when, meteorites, strike, the, ground, the, shock, wave, can, produce, high, enough, temperatures, and, pressures, for, microdiamonds, and, nanodiamonds, to, form, impact, type, microdiamonds, can, be, used, as, an, indicator, of, ancient, impact, craters, popigai, impact, structure, in, russia, may, have, the, world, s, largest, diamond, deposit, estimated, at, trillions, of, carats, and, formed, by, an, asteroid, impact, a, common, misconception, is, that, diamonds, form, from, highly, compressed, coal, coal, is, formed, from, buried, prehistoric, plants, and, most, diamonds, that, have, been, dated, are, far, older, than, the, first, land, plants, it, is, possible, that, diamonds, can, form, from, coal, in, subduction, zones, but, diamonds, formed, in, this, way, are, rare, and, the, carbon, source, is, more, likely, carbonate, rocks, and, organic, carbon, in, sediments, rather, than, coal, diamonds, are, far, from, evenly, distributed, over, the, earth, a, rule, of, thumb, known, as, clifford, s, rule, states, that, they, are, almost, always, found, in, kimberlites, on, the, oldest, part, of, cratons, the, stable, cores, of, continents, with, typical, ages, of, 2, 5, billion, years, or, more, 314, however, there, are, exceptions, the, argyle, diamond, mine, in, australia, the, largest, producer, of, diamonds, by, weight, in, the, world, is, located, in, a, mobile, belt, also, known, as, an, orogenic, belt, a, weaker, zone, surrounding, the, central, craton, that, has, undergone, compressional, tectonics, instead, of, kimberlite, the, host, rock, is, lamproite, lamproites, with, diamonds, that, are, not, economically, viable, are, also, found, in, the, united, states, india, and, australia, in, addition, diamonds, in, the, wawa, belt, of, the, superior, province, in, canada, and, microdiamonds, in, the, island, arc, of, japan, are, found, in, a, type, of, rock, called, lamprophyre, kimberlites, can, be, found, in, narrow, 1, to, 4, meters, dikes, and, sills, and, in, pipes, with, diameters, that, range, from, about, 75, m, to, 1, 5, km, fresh, rock, is, dark, bluish, green, to, greenish, gray, but, after, exposure, rapidly, turns, brown, and, crumbles, it, is, hybrid, rock, with, a, chaotic, mixture, of, small, minerals, and, rock, fragments, clasts, up, to, the, size, of, watermelons, they, are, a, mixture, of, xenocrysts, and, xenoliths, minerals, and, rocks, carried, up, from, the, lower, crust, and, mantle, pieces, of, surface, rock, altered, minerals, such, as, serpentine, and, new, minerals, that, crystallized, during, the, eruption, the, texture, varies, with, depth, the, composition, forms, a, continuum, with, carbonatites, but, the, latter, have, too, much, oxygen, for, carbon, to, exist, in, a, pure, form, instead, it, is, locked, up, in, the, mineral, calcite, ca, c, o, 3, all, three, of, the, diamond, bearing, rocks, kimberlite, lamproite, and, lamprophyre, lack, certain, minerals, melilite, and, kalsilite, that, are, incompatible, with, diamond, formation, in, kimberlite, olivine, is, large, and, conspicuous, while, lamproite, has, ti, phlogopite, and, lamprophyre, has, biotite, and, amphibole, they, are, all, derived, from, magma, types, that, erupt, rapidly, from, small, amounts, of, melt, are, rich, in, volatiles, and, magnesium, oxide, and, are, less, oxidizing, than, more, common, mantle, melts, such, as, basalt, these, characteristics, allow, the, melts, to, carry, diamonds, to, the, surface, before, they, dissolve, kimberlite, pipes, can, be, difficult, to, find, they, weather, quickly, within, a, few, years, after, exposure, and, tend, to, have, lower, topographic, relief, than, surrounding, rock, if, they, are, visible, in, outcrops, the, diamonds, are, never, visible, because, they, are, so, rare, in, any, case, kimberlites, are, often, covered, with, vegetation, sediments, soils, or, lakes, in, modern, searches, geophysical, methods, such, as, aeromagnetic, surveys, electrical, resistivity, and, gravimetry, help, identify, promising, regions, to, explore, this, is, aided, by, isotopic, dating, and, modeling, of, the, geological, history, then, surveyors, must, go, to, the, area, and, collect, samples, looking, for, kimberlite, fragments, or, indicator, minerals, the, latter, have, compositions, that, reflect, the, conditions, where, diamonds, form, such, as, extreme, melt, depletion, or, high, pressures, in, eclogites, however, indicator, minerals, can, be, misleading, a, better, approach, is, geothermobarometry, where, the, compositions, of, minerals, are, analyzed, as, if, they, were, in, equilibrium, with, mantle, minerals, finding, kimberlites, requires, persistence, and, only, a, small, fraction, contain, diamonds, that, are, commercially, viable, the, only, major, discoveries, since, about, 1980, have, been, in, canada, since, existing, mines, have, lifetimes, of, as, little, as, 25, years, there, could, be, a, shortage, of, new, diamonds, in, the, future, diamonds, are, dated, by, analyzing, inclusions, using, the, decay, of, radioactive, isotopes, depending, on, the, elemental, abundances, one, can, look, at, the, decay, of, rubidium, to, strontium, samarium, to, neodymium, uranium, to, lead, argon, 40, to, argon, 39, or, rhenium, to, osmium, those, found, in, kimberlites, have, ages, ranging, from, 1, to, 3, 5, billion, years, and, there, can, be, multiple, ages, in, the, same, kimberlite, indicating, multiple, episodes, of, diamond, formation, the, kimberlites, themselves, are, much, younger, most, of, them, have, ages, between, tens, of, millions, and, 300, million, years, old, although, there, are, some, older, exceptions, argyle, premier, and, wawa, thus, the, kimberlites, formed, independently, of, the, diamonds, and, served, only, to, transport, them, to, the, surface, kimberlites, are, also, much, younger, than, the, cratons, they, have, erupted, through, the, reason, for, the, lack, of, older, kimberlites, is, unknown, but, it, suggests, there, was, some, change, in, mantle, chemistry, or, tectonics, no, kimberlite, has, erupted, in, human, history, most, gem, quality, diamonds, come, from, depths, of, 150, 250, km, in, the, lithosphere, such, depths, occur, below, cratons, in, mantle, keels, the, thickest, part, of, the, lithosphere, these, regions, have, high, enough, pressure, and, temperature, to, allow, diamonds, to, form, and, they, are, not, convecting, so, diamonds, can, be, stored, for, billions, of, years, until, a, kimberlite, eruption, samples, them, host, rocks, in, a, mantle, keel, include, harzburgite, and, lherzolite, two, type, of, peridotite, the, most, dominant, rock, type, in, the, upper, mantle, peridotite, is, an, igneous, rock, consisting, mostly, of, the, minerals, olivine, and, pyroxene, it, is, low, in, silica, and, high, in, magnesium, however, diamonds, in, peridotite, rarely, survive, the, trip, to, the, surface, another, common, source, that, does, keep, diamonds, intact, is, eclogite, a, metamorphic, rock, that, typically, forms, from, basalt, as, an, oceanic, plate, plunges, into, the, mantle, at, a, subduction, zone, a, smaller, fraction, of, diamonds, about, 150, have, been, studied, come, from, depths, of, 330, 660, km, a, region, that, includes, the, transition, zone, they, formed, in, eclogite, but, are, distinguished, from, diamonds, of, shallower, origin, by, inclusions, of, majorite, a, form, of, garnet, with, excess, silicon, a, similar, proportion, of, diamonds, comes, from, the, lower, mantle, at, depths, between, 660, and, 800, km, diamond, is, thermodynamically, stable, at, high, pressures, and, temperatures, with, the, phase, transition, from, graphite, occurring, at, greater, temperatures, as, the, pressure, increases, thus, underneath, continents, it, becomes, stable, at, temperatures, of, 950, degrees, celsius, and, pressures, of, 4, 5, gigapascals, corresponding, to, depths, of, 150, kilometers, or, greater, in, subduction, zones, which, are, colder, it, becomes, stable, at, temperatures, of, 800, c, and, pressures, of, 3, 5, gigapascals, at, depths, greater, than, 240, km, iron, nickel, metal, phases, are, present, and, carbon, is, likely, to, be, either, dissolved, in, them, or, in, the, form, of, carbides, thus, the, deeper, origin, of, some, diamonds, may, reflect, unusual, growth, environments, in, 2018, the, first, known, natural, samples, of, a, phase, of, ice, called, ice, vii, were, found, as, inclusions, in, diamond, samples, the, inclusions, formed, at, depths, between, 400, and, 800, km, straddling, the, upper, and, lower, mantle, and, provide, evidence, for, water, rich, fluid, at, these, depths, the, mantle, has, roughly, one, billion, gigatonnes, of, carbon, for, comparison, the, atmosphere, ocean, system, has, about, 44, 000, gigatonnes, carbon, has, two, stable, isotopes, 12, c, and, 13, c, in, a, ratio, of, approximately, 99, 1, by, mass, this, ratio, has, a, wide, range, in, meteorites, which, implies, that, it, also, varied, a, lot, in, the, early, earth, it, can, also, be, altered, by, surface, processes, like, photosynthesis, the, fraction, is, generally, compared, to, a, standard, sample, using, a, ratio, 13, c, expressed, in, parts, per, thousand, common, rocks, from, the, mantle, such, as, basalts, carbonatites, and, kimberlites, have, ratios, between, 8, and, 2, on, the, surface, organic, sediments, have, an, average, of, 25, while, carbonates, have, an, average, of, 0, populations, of, diamonds, from, different, sources, have, distributions, of, 13, c, that, vary, markedly, peridotitic, diamonds, are, mostly, within, the, typical, mantle, range, eclogitic, diamonds, have, values, from, 40, to, 3, although, the, peak, of, the, distribution, is, in, the, mantle, range, this, variability, implies, that, they, are, not, formed, from, carbon, that, is, primordial, having, resided, in, the, mantle, since, the, earth, formed, instead, they, are, the, result, of, tectonic, processes, although, given, the, ages, of, diamonds, not, necessarily, the, same, tectonic, processes, that, act, in, the, present, diamonds, in, the, mantle, form, through, a, metasomatic, process, where, a, c, o, h, n, s, fluid, or, melt, dissolves, minerals, in, a, rock, and, replaces, them, with, new, minerals, the, vague, term, c, o, h, n, s, is, commonly, used, because, the, exact, composition, is, not, known, diamonds, form, from, this, fluid, either, by, reduction, of, oxidized, carbon, e, g, co, 2, or, co, 3, or, oxidation, of, a, reduced, phase, such, as, methane, using, probes, such, as, polarized, light, photoluminescence, and, cathodoluminescence, a, series, of, growth, zones, can, be, identified, in, diamonds, the, characteristic, pattern, in, diamonds, from, the, lithosphere, involves, a, nearly, concentric, series, of, zones, with, very, thin, oscillations, in, luminescence, and, alternating, episodes, where, the, carbon, is, resorbed, by, the, fluid, and, then, grown, again, diamonds, from, below, the, lithosphere, have, a, more, irregular, almost, polycrystalline, texture, reflecting, the, higher, temperatures, and, pressures, as, well, as, the, transport, of, the, diamonds, by, convection, geological, evidence, supports, a, model, in, which, kimberlite, magma, rises, at, 4, 20, meters, per, second, creating, an, upward, path, by, hydraulic, fracturing, of, the, rock, as, the, pressure, decreases, a, vapor, phase, exsolves, from, the, magma, and, this, helps, to, keep, the, magma, fluid, at, the, surface, the, initial, eruption, explodes, out, through, fissures, at, high, speeds, over, 200, m, s, 450, mph, then, at, lower, pressures, the, rock, is, eroded, forming, a, pipe, and, producing, fragmented, rock, breccia, as, the, eruption, wanes, there, is, pyroclastic, phase, and, then, metamorphism, and, hydration, produces, serpentinites, in, rare, cases, diamonds, have, been, found, that, contain, a, cavity, within, which, is, a, second, diamond, the, first, double, diamond, the, matryoshka, was, found, by, alrosa, in, yakutia, russia, in, 2019, another, one, was, found, in, the, ellendale, diamond, field, in, western, australia, in, 2021, although, diamonds, on, earth, are, rare, they, are, very, common, in, space, in, meteorites, about, three, percent, of, the, carbon, is, in, the, form, of, nanodiamonds, having, diameters, of, a, few, nanometers, sufficiently, small, diamonds, can, form, in, the, cold, of, space, because, their, lower, surface, energy, makes, them, more, stable, than, graphite, the, isotopic, signatures, of, some, nanodiamonds, indicate, they, were, formed, outside, the, solar, system, in, stars, high, pressure, experiments, predict, that, large, quantities, of, diamonds, condense, from, methane, into, a, diamond, rain, on, the, ice, giant, planets, uranus, and, neptune, some, extrasolar, planets, may, be, almost, entirely, composed, of, diamond, diamonds, may, exist, in, carbon, rich, stars, particularly, white, dwarfs, one, theory, for, the, origin, of, carbonado, the, toughest, form, of, diamond, is, that, it, originated, in, a, white, dwarf, or, supernova, diamonds, formed, in, stars, may, have, been, the, first, minerals, the, most, familiar, uses, of, diamonds, today, are, as, gemstones, used, for, adornment, and, as, industrial, abrasives, for, cutting, hard, materials, the, markets, for, gem, grade, and, industrial, grade, diamonds, value, diamonds, differently, the, dispersion, of, white, light, into, spectral, colors, is, the, primary, gemological, characteristic, of, gem, diamonds, in, the, 20th, century, experts, in, gemology, developed, methods, of, grading, diamonds, and, other, gemstones, based, on, the, characteristics, most, important, to, their, value, as, a, gem, four, characteristics, known, informally, as, the, four, cs, are, now, commonly, used, as, the, basic, descriptors, of, diamonds, these, are, its, mass, in, carats, a, carat, being, equal, to, 0, 2, grams, cut, quality, of, the, cut, is, graded, according, to, proportions, symmetry, and, polish, color, how, close, to, white, or, colorless, for, fancy, diamonds, how, intense, is, its, hue, and, clarity, how, free, is, it, from, inclusions, a, large, flawless, diamond, is, known, as, a, paragon, a, large, trade, in, gem, grade, diamonds, exists, although, most, gem, grade, diamonds, are, sold, newly, polished, there, is, a, well, established, market, for, resale, of, polished, diamonds, e, g, pawnbroking, auctions, second, hand, jewelry, stores, diamantaires, bourses, etc, one, hallmark, of, the, trade, in, gem, quality, diamonds, is, its, remarkable, concentration, wholesale, trade, and, diamond, cutting, is, limited, to, just, a, few, locations, in, 2003, 92, of, the, world, s, diamonds, were, cut, and, polished, in, surat, india, other, important, centers, of, diamond, cutting, and, trading, are, the, antwerp, diamond, district, in, belgium, where, the, international, gemological, institute, is, based, london, the, diamond, district, in, new, york, city, the, diamond, exchange, district, in, tel, aviv, and, amsterdam, one, contributory, factor, is, the, geological, nature, of, diamond, deposits, several, large, primary, kimberlite, pipe, mines, each, account, for, significant, portions, of, market, share, such, as, the, jwaneng, mine, in, botswana, which, is, a, single, large, pit, mine, that, can, produce, between, 12, 500, 000, and, 15, 000, 000, carats, 2, 500, and, 3, 000, kg, of, diamonds, per, year, secondary, alluvial, diamond, deposits, on, the, other, hand, tend, to, be, fragmented, amongst, many, different, operators, because, they, can, be, dispersed, over, many, hundreds, of, square, kilometers, e, g, alluvial, deposits, in, brazil, the, production, and, distribution, of, diamonds, is, largely, consolidated, in, the, hands, of, a, few, key, players, and, concentrated, in, traditional, diamond, trading, centers, the, most, important, being, antwerp, where, 80, of, all, rough, diamonds, 50, of, all, cut, diamonds, and, more, than, 50, of, all, rough, cut, and, industrial, diamonds, combined, are, handled, this, makes, antwerp, a, de, facto, world, diamond, capital, the, city, of, antwerp, also, hosts, the, antwerpsche, diamantkring, created, in, 1929, to, become, the, first, and, biggest, diamond, bourse, dedicated, to, rough, diamonds, another, important, diamond, center, is, new, york, city, where, almost, 80, of, the, world, s, diamonds, are, sold, including, auction, sales, the, de, beers, company, as, the, world, s, largest, diamond, mining, company, holds, a, dominant, position, in, the, industry, and, has, done, so, since, soon, after, its, founding, in, 1888, by, the, british, businessman, cecil, rhodes, de, beers, is, currently, the, world, s, largest, operator, of, diamond, production, facilities, mines, and, distribution, channels, for, gem, quality, diamonds, the, diamond, trading, company, dtc, is, a, subsidiary, of, de, beers, and, markets, rough, diamonds, from, de, beers, operated, mines, de, beers, and, its, subsidiaries, own, mines, that, produce, some, 40, of, annual, world, diamond, production, for, most, of, the, 20th, century, over, 80, of, the, world, s, rough, diamonds, passed, through, de, beers, but, by, 2001, 2009, the, figure, had, decreased, to, around, 45, and, by, 2013, the, company, s, market, share, had, further, decreased, to, around, 38, in, value, terms, and, even, less, by, volume, de, beers, sold, off, the, vast, majority, of, its, diamond, stockpile, in, the, late, 1990s, early, 2000s, and, the, remainder, largely, represents, working, stock, diamonds, that, are, being, sorted, before, sale, this, was, well, documented, in, the, press, but, remains, little, known, to, the, general, public, as, a, part, of, reducing, its, influence, de, beers, withdrew, from, purchasing, diamonds, on, the, open, market, in, 1999, and, ceased, at, the, end, of, 2008, purchasing, russian, diamonds, mined, by, the, largest, russian, diamond, company, alrosa, as, of, january, 2011, de, beers, states, that, it, only, sells, diamonds, from, the, following, four, countries, botswana, namibia, south, africa, and, canada, alrosa, had, to, suspend, their, sales, in, october, 2008, due, to, the, global, energy, crisis, but, the, company, reported, that, it, had, resumed, selling, rough, diamonds, on, the, open, market, by, october, 2009, apart, from, alrosa, other, important, diamond, mining, companies, include, bhp, which, is, the, world, s, largest, mining, company, rio, tinto, the, owner, of, the, argyle, 100, diavik, 60, and, murowa, 78, diamond, mines, and, petra, diamonds, the, owner, of, several, major, diamond, mines, in, africa, further, down, the, supply, chain, members, of, the, world, federation, of, diamond, bourses, wfdb, act, as, a, medium, for, wholesale, diamond, exchange, trading, both, polished, and, rough, diamonds, the, wfdb, consists, of, independent, diamond, bourses, in, major, cutting, centers, such, as, tel, aviv, antwerp, johannesburg, and, other, cities, across, the, us, europe, and, asia, in, 2000, the, wfdb, and, the, international, diamond, manufacturers, association, established, the, world, diamond, council, to, prevent, the, trading, of, diamonds, used, to, fund, war, and, inhumane, acts, wfdb, s, additional, activities, include, sponsoring, the, world, diamond, congress, every, two, years, as, well, as, the, establishment, of, the, international, diamond, council, idc, to, oversee, diamond, grading, once, purchased, by, sightholders, which, is, a, trademark, term, referring, to, the, companies, that, have, a, three, year, supply, contract, with, dtc, diamonds, are, cut, and, polished, in, preparation, for, sale, as, gemstones, industrial, stones, are, regarded, as, a, by, product, of, the, gemstone, market, they, are, used, for, abrasives, the, cutting, and, polishing, of, rough, diamonds, is, a, specialized, skill, that, is, concentrated, in, a, limited, number, of, locations, worldwide, traditional, diamond, cutting, centers, are, antwerp, amsterdam, johannesburg, new, york, city, and, tel, aviv, recently, diamond, cutting, centers, have, been, established, in, china, india, thailand, namibia, and, botswana, cutting, centers, with, lower, cost, of, labor, notably, surat, in, gujarat, india, handle, a, larger, number, of, smaller, carat, diamonds, while, smaller, quantities, of, larger, or, more, valuable, diamonds, are, more, likely, to, be, handled, in, europe, or, north, america, the, recent, expansion, of, this, industry, in, india, employing, low, cost, labor, has, allowed, smaller, diamonds, to, be, prepared, as, gems, in, greater, quantities, than, was, previously, economically, feasible, diamonds, prepared, as, gemstones, are, sold, on, diamond, exchanges, called, bourses, there, are, 28, registered, diamond, bourses, in, the, world, bourses, are, the, final, tightly, controlled, step, in, the, diamond, supply, chain, wholesalers, and, even, retailers, are, able, to, buy, relatively, small, lots, of, diamonds, at, the, bourses, after, which, they, are, prepared, for, final, sale, to, the, consumer, diamonds, can, be, sold, already, set, in, jewelry, or, sold, unset, loose, according, to, the, rio, tinto, in, 2002, the, diamonds, produced, and, released, to, the, market, were, valued, at, us, 9, billion, as, rough, diamonds, us, 14, billion, after, being, cut, and, polished, us, 28, billion, in, wholesale, diamond, jewelry, and, us, 57, billion, in, retail, sales, mined, rough, diamonds, are, converted, into, gems, through, a, multi, step, process, called, cutting, diamonds, are, extremely, hard, but, also, brittle, and, can, be, split, up, by, a, single, blow, therefore, diamond, cutting, is, traditionally, considered, as, a, delicate, procedure, requiring, skills, scientific, knowledge, tools, and, experience, its, final, goal, is, to, produce, a, faceted, jewel, where, the, specific, angles, between, the, facets, would, optimize, the, diamond, luster, that, is, dispersion, of, white, light, whereas, the, number, and, area, of, facets, would, determine, the, weight, of, the, final, product, the, weight, reduction, upon, cutting, is, significant, and, can, be, of, the, order, of, 50, several, possible, shapes, are, considered, but, the, final, decision, is, often, determined, not, only, by, scientific, but, also, practical, considerations, for, example, the, diamond, might, be, intended, for, display, or, for, wear, in, a, ring, or, a, necklace, singled, or, surrounded, by, other, gems, of, certain, color, and, shape, some, of, them, may, be, considered, as, classical, such, as, round, pear, marquise, oval, hearts, and, arrows, diamonds, etc, some, of, them, are, special, produced, by, certain, companies, for, example, phoenix, cushion, sole, mio, diamonds, etc, the, most, time, consuming, part, of, the, cutting, is, the, preliminary, analysis, of, the, rough, stone, it, needs, to, address, a, large, number, of, issues, bears, much, responsibility, and, therefore, can, last, years, in, case, of, unique, diamonds, the, following, issues, are, considered, after, initial, cutting, the, diamond, is, shaped, in, numerous, stages, of, polishing, unlike, cutting, which, is, a, responsible, but, quick, operation, polishing, removes, material, by, gradual, erosion, and, is, extremely, time, consuming, the, associated, technique, is, well, developed, it, is, considered, as, a, routine, and, can, be, performed, by, technicians, after, polishing, the, diamond, is, reexamined, for, possible, flaws, either, remaining, or, induced, by, the, process, those, flaws, are, concealed, through, various, diamond, enhancement, techniques, such, as, repolishing, crack, filling, or, clever, arrangement, of, the, stone, in, the, jewelry, remaining, non, diamond, inclusions, are, removed, through, laser, drilling, and, filling, of, the, voids, produced, marketing, has, significantly, affected, the, image, of, diamond, as, a, valuable, commodity, n, w, ayer, son, the, advertising, firm, retained, by, de, beers, in, the, mid, 20th, century, succeeded, in, reviving, the, american, diamond, market, and, the, firm, created, new, markets, in, countries, where, no, diamond, tradition, had, existed, before, n, w, ayer, s, marketing, included, product, placement, advertising, focused, on, the, diamond, product, itself, rather, than, the, de, beers, brand, and, associations, with, celebrities, and, royalty, without, advertising, the, de, beers, brand, de, beers, was, advertising, its, competitors, diamond, products, as, well, but, this, was, not, a, concern, as, de, beers, dominated, the, diamond, market, throughout, the, 20th, century, de, beers, market, share, dipped, temporarily, to, second, place, in, the, global, market, below, alrosa, in, the, aftermath, of, the, global, economic, crisis, of, 2008, down, to, less, than, 29, in, terms, of, carats, mined, rather, than, sold, the, campaign, lasted, for, decades, but, was, effectively, discontinued, by, early, 2011, de, beers, still, advertises, diamonds, but, the, advertising, now, mostly, promotes, its, own, brands, or, licensed, product, lines, rather, than, completely, generic, diamond, products, the, campaign, was, perhaps, best, captured, by, the, slogan, a, diamond, is, forever, this, slogan, is, now, being, used, by, de, beers, diamond, jewelers, a, jewelry, firm, which, is, a, 50, 50, joint, venture, between, the, de, beers, mining, company, and, lvmh, the, luxury, goods, conglomerate, brown, colored, diamonds, constituted, a, significant, part, of, the, diamond, production, and, were, predominantly, used, for, industrial, purposes, they, were, seen, as, worthless, for, jewelry, not, even, being, assessed, on, the, diamond, color, scale, after, the, development, of, argyle, diamond, mine, in, australia, in, 1986, and, marketing, brown, diamonds, have, become, acceptable, gems, the, change, was, mostly, due, to, the, numbers, the, argyle, mine, with, its, 35, 000, 000, carats, 7, 000, kg, of, diamonds, per, year, makes, about, one, third, of, global, production, of, natural, diamonds, 80, of, argyle, diamonds, are, brown, industrial, diamonds, are, valued, mostly, for, their, hardness, and, thermal, conductivity, making, many, of, the, gemological, characteristics, of, diamonds, such, as, the, 4, cs, irrelevant, for, most, applications, eighty, percent, of, mined, diamonds, equal, to, about, 135, 000, 000, carats, 27, 000, kg, annually, are, unsuitable, for, use, as, gemstones, and, are, used, industrially, in, addition, to, mined, diamonds, synthetic, diamonds, found, industrial, applications, almost, immediately, after, their, invention, in, the, 1950s, in, 2014, 4, 500, 000, 000, carats, 900, 000, kg, of, synthetic, diamonds, were, produced, 90, of, which, were, produced, in, china, approximately, 90, of, diamond, grinding, grit, is, currently, of, synthetic, origin, the, boundary, between, gem, quality, diamonds, and, industrial, diamonds, is, poorly, defined, and, partly, depends, on, market, conditions, for, example, if, demand, for, polished, diamonds, is, high, some, lower, grade, stones, will, be, polished, into, low, quality, or, small, gemstones, rather, than, being, sold, for, industrial, use, within, the, category, of, industrial, diamonds, there, is, a, sub, category, comprising, the, lowest, quality, mostly, opaque, stones, which, are, known, as, bort, industrial, use, of, diamonds, has, historically, been, associated, with, their, hardness, which, makes, diamond, the, ideal, material, for, cutting, and, grinding, tools, as, the, hardest, known, naturally, occurring, material, diamond, can, be, used, to, polish, cut, or, wear, away, any, material, including, other, diamonds, common, industrial, applications, of, this, property, include, diamond, tipped, drill, bits, and, saws, and, the, use, of, diamond, powder, as, an, abrasive, less, expensive, industrial, grade, diamonds, bort, with, more, flaws, and, poorer, color, than, gems, are, used, for, such, purposes, diamond, is, not, suitable, for, machining, ferrous, alloys, at, high, speeds, as, carbon, is, soluble, in, iron, at, the, high, temperatures, created, by, high, speed, machining, leading, to, greatly, increased, wear, on, diamond, tools, compared, to, alternatives, specialized, applications, include, use, in, laboratories, as, containment, for, high, pressure, experiments, see, diamond, anvil, cell, high, performance, bearings, and, limited, use, in, specialized, windows, with, the, continuing, advances, being, made, in, the, production, of, synthetic, diamonds, future, applications, are, becoming, feasible, the, high, thermal, conductivity, of, diamond, makes, it, suitable, as, a, heat, sink, for, integrated, circuits, in, electronics, approximately, 130, 000, 000, carats, 26, 000, kg, of, diamonds, are, mined, annually, with, a, total, value, of, nearly, us, 9, billion, and, about, 100, 000, kg, 220, 000, lb, are, synthesized, annually, roughly, 49, of, diamonds, originate, from, central, and, southern, africa, although, significant, sources, of, the, mineral, have, been, discovered, in, canada, india, russia, brazil, and, australia, they, are, mined, from, kimberlite, and, lamproite, volcanic, pipes, which, can, bring, diamond, crystals, originating, from, deep, within, the, earth, where, high, pressures, and, temperatures, enable, them, to, form, to, the, surface, the, mining, and, distribution, of, natural, diamonds, are, subjects, of, frequent, controversy, such, as, concerns, over, the, sale, of, blood, diamonds, or, conflict, diamonds, by, african, paramilitary, groups, the, diamond, supply, chain, is, controlled, by, a, limited, number, of, powerful, businesses, and, is, also, highly, concentrated, in, a, small, number, of, locations, around, the, world, only, a, very, small, fraction, of, the, diamond, ore, consists, of, actual, diamonds, the, ore, is, crushed, during, which, care, is, required, not, to, destroy, larger, diamonds, and, then, sorted, by, density, today, diamonds, are, located, in, the, diamond, rich, density, fraction, with, the, help, of, x, ray, fluorescence, after, which, the, final, sorting, steps, are, done, by, hand, before, the, use, of, x, rays, became, commonplace, the, separation, was, done, with, grease, belts, diamonds, have, a, stronger, tendency, to, stick, to, grease, than, the, other, minerals, in, the, ore, historically, diamonds, were, found, only, in, alluvial, deposits, in, guntur, and, krishna, district, of, the, krishna, river, delta, in, southern, india, india, led, the, world, in, diamond, production, from, the, time, of, their, discovery, in, approximately, the, 9th, century, bc, to, the, mid, 18th, century, ad, but, the, commercial, potential, of, these, sources, had, been, exhausted, by, the, late, 18th, century, and, at, that, time, india, was, eclipsed, by, brazil, where, the, first, non, indian, diamonds, were, found, in, 1725, currently, one, of, the, most, prominent, indian, mines, is, located, at, panna, diamond, extraction, from, primary, deposits, kimberlites, and, lamproites, started, in, the, 1870s, after, the, discovery, of, the, diamond, fields, in, south, africa, production, has, increased, over, time, and, now, an, accumulated, total, of, 4, 500, 000, 000, carats, 900, 000, kg, have, been, mined, since, that, date, twenty, percent, of, that, amount, has, been, mined, in, the, last, five, years, and, during, the, last, 10, years, nine, new, mines, have, started, production, four, more, are, waiting, to, be, opened, soon, most, of, these, mines, are, located, in, canada, zimbabwe, angola, and, one, in, russia, in, the, u, s, diamonds, have, been, found, in, arkansas, colorado, new, mexico, wyoming, and, montana, in, 2004, the, discovery, of, a, microscopic, diamond, in, the, u, s, led, to, the, january, 2008, bulk, sampling, of, kimberlite, pipes, in, a, remote, part, of, montana, the, crater, of, diamonds, state, park, in, arkansas, is, open, to, the, public, and, is, the, only, mine, in, the, world, where, members, of, the, public, can, dig, for, diamonds, today, most, commercially, viable, diamond, deposits, are, in, russia, mostly, in, sakha, republic, for, example, mir, pipe, and, udachnaya, pipe, botswana, australia, northern, and, western, australia, and, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, in, 2005, russia, produced, almost, one, fifth, of, the, global, diamond, output, according, to, the, british, geological, survey, australia, boasts, the, richest, diamantiferous, pipe, with, production, from, the, argyle, diamond, mine, reaching, peak, levels, of, 42, metric, tons, per, year, in, the, 1990s, there, are, also, commercial, deposits, being, actively, mined, in, the, northwest, territories, of, canada, and, brazil, diamond, prospectors, continue, to, search, the, globe, for, diamond, bearing, kimberlite, and, lamproite, pipes, in, some, of, the, more, politically, unstable, central, african, and, west, african, countries, revolutionary, groups, have, taken, control, of, diamond, mines, using, proceeds, from, diamond, sales, to, finance, their, operations, diamonds, sold, through, this, process, are, known, as, conflict, diamonds, or, blood, diamonds, in, response, to, public, concerns, that, their, diamond, purchases, were, contributing, to, war, and, human, rights, abuses, in, central, and, western, africa, the, united, nations, the, diamond, industry, and, diamond, trading, nations, introduced, the, kimberley, process, in, 2002, the, kimberley, process, aims, to, ensure, that, conflict, diamonds, do, not, become, intermixed, with, the, diamonds, not, controlled, by, such, rebel, groups, this, is, done, by, requiring, diamond, producing, countries, to, provide, proof, that, the, money, they, make, from, selling, the, diamonds, is, not, used, to, fund, criminal, or, revolutionary, activities, although, the, kimberley, process, has, been, moderately, successful, in, limiting, the, number, of, conflict, diamonds, entering, the, market, some, still, find, their, way, in, according, to, the, international, diamond, manufacturers, association, conflict, diamonds, constitute, 2, 3, of, all, diamonds, traded, two, major, flaws, still, hinder, the, effectiveness, of, the, kimberley, process, 1, the, relative, ease, of, smuggling, diamonds, across, african, borders, and, 2, the, violent, nature, of, diamond, mining, in, nations, that, are, not, in, a, technical, state, of, war, and, whose, diamonds, are, therefore, considered, clean, the, canadian, government, has, set, up, a, body, known, as, the, canadian, diamond, code, of, conduct, to, help, authenticate, canadian, diamonds, this, is, a, stringent, tracking, system, of, diamonds, and, helps, protect, the, conflict, free, label, of, canadian, diamonds, mineral, resource, exploitation, in, general, causes, irreversible, environmental, damage, which, must, be, weighed, against, the, socio, economic, benefits, to, a, country, synthetic, diamonds, are, diamonds, manufactured, in, a, laboratory, as, opposed, to, diamonds, mined, from, the, earth, the, gemological, and, industrial, uses, of, diamond, have, created, a, large, demand, for, rough, stones, this, demand, has, been, satisfied, in, large, part, by, synthetic, diamonds, which, have, been, manufactured, by, various, processes, for, more, than, half, a, century, however, in, recent, years, it, has, become, possible, to, produce, gem, quality, synthetic, diamonds, of, significant, size, it, is, possible, to, make, colorless, synthetic, gemstones, that, on, a, molecular, level, are, identical, to, natural, stones, and, so, visually, similar, that, only, a, gemologist, with, special, equipment, can, tell, the, difference, the, majority, of, commercially, available, synthetic, diamonds, are, yellow, and, are, produced, by, so, called, high, pressure, high, temperature, hpht, processes, the, yellow, color, is, caused, by, nitrogen, impurities, other, colors, may, also, be, reproduced, such, as, blue, green, or, pink, which, are, a, result, of, the, addition, of, boron, or, from, irradiation, after, synthesis, another, popular, method, of, growing, synthetic, diamond, is, chemical, vapor, deposition, cvd, the, growth, occurs, under, low, pressure, below, atmospheric, pressure, it, involves, feeding, a, mixture, of, gases, typically, 1, to, 99, methane, to, hydrogen, into, a, chamber, and, splitting, them, into, chemically, active, radicals, in, a, plasma, ignited, by, microwaves, hot, filament, arc, discharge, welding, torch, or, laser, this, method, is, mostly, used, for, coatings, but, can, also, produce, single, crystals, several, millimeters, in, size, see, picture, as, of, 2010, nearly, all, 5, 000, million, carats, 1, 000, tonnes, of, synthetic, diamonds, produced, per, year, are, for, industrial, use, around, 50, of, the, 133, million, carats, of, natural, diamonds, mined, per, year, end, up, in, industrial, use, mining, companies, expenses, average, 40, to, 60, us, dollars, per, carat, for, natural, colorless, diamonds, while, synthetic, manufacturers, expenses, average, 2, 500, per, carat, for, synthetic, gem, quality, colorless, diamonds, 79, however, a, purchaser, is, more, likely, to, encounter, a, synthetic, when, looking, for, a, fancy, colored, diamond, because, only, 0, 01, of, natural, diamonds, are, fancy, colored, while, most, synthetic, diamonds, are, colored, in, some, way, a, diamond, simulant, is, a, non, diamond, material, that, is, used, to, simulate, the, appearance, of, a, diamond, and, may, be, referred, to, as, diamante, cubic, zirconia, is, the, most, common, the, gemstone, moissanite, silicon, carbide, can, be, treated, as, a, diamond, simulant, though, more, costly, to, produce, than, cubic, zirconia, both, are, produced, synthetically, diamond, enhancements, are, specific, treatments, performed, on, natural, or, synthetic, diamonds, usually, those, already, cut, and, polished, into, a, gem, which, are, designed, to, better, the, gemological, characteristics, of, the, stone, in, one, or, more, ways, these, include, laser, drilling, to, remove, inclusions, application, of, sealants, to, fill, cracks, treatments, to, improve, a, white, diamond, s, color, grade, and, treatments, to, give, fancy, color, to, a, white, diamond, coatings, are, increasingly, used, to, give, a, diamond, simulant, such, as, cubic, zirconia, a, more, diamond, like, appearance, one, such, substance, is, diamond, like, carbon, an, amorphous, carbonaceous, material, that, has, some, physical, properties, similar, to, those, of, the, diamond, advertising, suggests, that, such, a, coating, would, transfer, some, of, these, diamond, like, properties, to, the, coated, stone, hence, enhancing, the, diamond, simulant, techniques, such, as, raman, spectroscopy, should, easily, identify, such, a, treatment, early, diamond, identification, tests, included, a, scratch, test, relying, on, the, superior, hardness, of, diamond, this, test, is, destructive, as, a, diamond, can, scratch, another, diamond, and, is, rarely, used, nowadays, instead, diamond, identification, relies, on, its, superior, thermal, conductivity, electronic, thermal, probes, are, widely, used, in, the, gemological, centers, to, separate, diamonds, from, their, imitations, these, probes, consist, of, a, pair, of, battery, powered, thermistors, mounted, in, a, fine, copper, tip, one, thermistor, functions, as, a, heating, device, while, the, other, measures, the, temperature, of, the, copper, tip, if, the, stone, being, tested, is, a, diamond, it, will, conduct, the, tip, s, thermal, energy, rapidly, enough, to, produce, a, measurable, temperature, drop, this, test, takes, about, two, to, three, seconds, whereas, the, thermal, probe, can, separate, diamonds, from, most, of, their, simulants, distinguishing, between, various, types, of, diamond, for, example, synthetic, or, natural, irradiated, or, non, irradiated, etc, requires, more, advanced, optical, techniques, those, techniques, are, also, used, for, some, diamonds, simulants, such, as, silicon, carbide, which, pass, the, thermal, conductivity, test, optical, techniques, can, distinguish, between, natural, diamonds, and, synthetic, diamonds, they, can, also, identify, the, vast, majority, of, treated, natural, diamonds, perfect, crystals, at, the, atomic, lattice, level, have, never, been, found, so, both, natural, and, synthetic, diamonds, always, possess, characteristic, imperfections, arising, from, the, circumstances, of, their, crystal, growth, that, allow, them, to, be, distinguished, from, each, other, laboratories, use, techniques, such, as, spectroscopy, microscopy, and, luminescence, under, shortwave, ultraviolet, light, to, determine, a, diamond, s, origin, they, also, use, specially, made, instruments, to, aid, them, in, the, identification, process, two, screening, instruments, are, the, diamondsure, and, the, diamondview, both, produced, by, the, dtc, and, marketed, by, the, gia, several, methods, for, identifying, synthetic, diamonds, can, be, performed, depending, on, the, method, of, production, and, the, color, of, the, diamond, cvd, diamonds, can, usually, be, identified, by, an, orange, fluorescence, d, j, colored, diamonds, can, be, screened, through, the, swiss, gemmological, institute, s, diamond, spotter, stones, in, the, d, z, color, range, can, be, examined, through, the, diamondsure, uv, visible, spectrometer, a, tool, developed, by, de, beers, similarly, natural, diamonds, usually, have, minor, imperfections, and, flaws, such, as, inclusions, of, foreign, material, that, are, not, seen, in, synthetic, diamonds, screening, devices, based, on, diamond, type, detection, can, be, used, to, make, a, distinction, between, diamonds, that, are, certainly, natural, and, diamonds, that, are, potentially, synthetic, those, potentially, synthetic, diamonds, require, more, investigation, in, a, specialized, lab, examples, of, commercial, screening, devices, are, d, screen, wtocd, hrd, antwerp, alpha, diamond, analyzer, bruker, hrd, antwerp, and, d, secure, drc, techno, the, name, diamond, is, derived, from, ancient, greek, ad, mas, proper, unalterable, unbreakable, untamed, from, a, not, ancient, greek, dam, to, overpower, tame, diamonds, are, thought, to, have, been, first, recognized, and, mined, in, india, where, significant, alluvial, deposits, of, the, stone, could, be, found, many, centuries, ago, along, the, rivers, penner, krishna, and, godavari, diamonds, have, been, known, in, india, for, at, least, 3, 000, years, but, most, likely, 6, 000, years, diamonds, have, been, treasured, as, gemstones, since, their, use, as, religious, icons, in, ancient, india, their, usage, in, engraving, tools, also, dates, to, early, human, history, the, popularity, of, diamonds, has, risen, since, the, 19th, century, because, of, increased, supply, improved, cutting, and, polishing, techniques, growth, in, the, world, economy, and, innovative, and, successful, advertising, campaigns, in, 1772, the, french, scientist, antoine, lavoisier, used, a, lens, to, concentrate, the, rays, of, the, sun, on, a, diamond, in, an, atmosphere, of, oxygen, and, showed, that, the, only, product, of, the, combustion, was, carbon, dioxide, proving, that, diamond, is, composed, of, carbon, later, in, 1797, the, english, chemist, smithson, tennant, repeated, and, expanded, that, experiment, by, demonstrating, that, burning, diamond, and, graphite, releases, the, same, amount, of, gas, he, established, the, chemical, equivalence, of, these, substances
