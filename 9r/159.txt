orbital, mechanics, or, astrodynamics, is, the, application, of, ballistics, and, celestial, mechanics, to, the, practical, problems, concerning, the, motion, of, rockets, satellites, and, other, spacecraft, the, motion, of, these, objects, is, usually, calculated, from, newton, s, laws, of, motion, and, the, law, of, universal, gravitation, orbital, mechanics, is, a, core, discipline, within, space, mission, design, and, control, celestial, mechanics, treats, more, broadly, the, orbital, dynamics, of, systems, under, the, influence, of, gravity, including, both, spacecraft, and, natural, astronomical, bodies, such, as, star, systems, planets, moons, and, comets, orbital, mechanics, focuses, on, spacecraft, trajectories, including, orbital, maneuvers, orbital, plane, changes, and, interplanetary, transfers, and, is, used, by, mission, planners, to, predict, the, results, of, propulsive, maneuvers, general, relativity, is, a, more, exact, theory, than, newton, s, laws, for, calculating, orbits, and, it, is, sometimes, necessary, to, use, it, for, greater, accuracy, or, in, high, gravity, situations, e, g, orbits, near, the, sun, until, the, rise, of, space, travel, in, the, twentieth, century, there, was, little, distinction, between, orbital, and, celestial, mechanics, at, the, time, of, sputnik, the, field, was, termed, space, dynamics, the, fundamental, techniques, such, as, those, used, to, solve, the, keplerian, problem, determining, position, as, a, function, of, time, are, therefore, the, same, in, both, fields, furthermore, the, history, of, the, fields, is, almost, entirely, shared, johannes, kepler, was, the, first, to, successfully, model, planetary, orbits, to, a, high, degree, of, accuracy, publishing, his, laws, in, 1605, isaac, newton, published, more, general, laws, of, celestial, motion, in, the, first, edition, of, philosophi, naturalis, principia, mathematica, 1687, which, gave, a, method, for, finding, the, orbit, of, a, body, following, a, parabolic, path, from, three, observations, this, was, used, by, edmund, halley, to, establish, the, orbits, of, various, comets, including, that, which, bears, his, name, newton, s, method, of, successive, approximation, was, formalised, into, an, analytic, method, by, leonhard, euler, in, 1744, whose, work, was, in, turn, generalised, to, elliptical, and, hyperbolic, orbits, by, johann, lambert, in, 1761, 1777, another, milestone, in, orbit, determination, was, carl, friedrich, gauss, s, assistance, in, the, recovery, of, the, dwarf, planet, ceres, in, 1801, gauss, s, method, was, able, to, use, just, three, observations, in, the, form, of, pairs, of, right, ascension, and, declination, to, find, the, six, orbital, elements, that, completely, describe, an, orbit, the, theory, of, orbit, determination, has, subsequently, been, developed, to, the, point, where, today, it, is, applied, in, gps, receivers, as, well, as, the, tracking, and, cataloguing, of, newly, observed, minor, planets, modern, orbit, determination, and, prediction, are, used, to, operate, all, types, of, satellites, and, space, probes, as, it, is, necessary, to, know, their, future, positions, to, a, high, degree, of, accuracy, astrodynamics, was, developed, by, astronomer, samuel, herrick, beginning, in, the, 1930s, he, consulted, the, rocket, scientist, robert, goddard, and, was, encouraged, to, continue, his, work, on, space, navigation, techniques, as, goddard, believed, they, would, be, needed, in, the, future, numerical, techniques, of, astrodynamics, were, coupled, with, new, powerful, computers, in, the, 1960s, and, humans, were, ready, to, travel, to, the, moon, and, return, the, following, rules, of, thumb, are, useful, for, situations, approximated, by, classical, mechanics, under, the, standard, assumptions, of, astrodynamics, outlined, below, the, specific, example, discussed, is, of, a, satellite, orbiting, a, planet, but, the, rules, of, thumb, could, also, apply, to, other, situations, such, as, orbits, of, small, bodies, around, a, star, such, as, the, sun, the, consequences, of, the, rules, of, orbital, mechanics, are, sometimes, counter, intuitive, for, example, if, two, spacecrafts, are, in, the, same, circular, orbit, and, wish, to, dock, unless, they, are, very, close, the, trailing, craft, cannot, simply, fire, its, engines, to, go, faster, this, will, change, the, shape, of, its, orbit, causing, it, to, gain, altitude, and, actually, slow, down, relative, to, the, leading, craft, missing, the, target, the, space, rendezvous, before, docking, normally, takes, multiple, precisely, calculated, engine, firings, in, multiple, orbital, periods, requiring, hours, or, even, days, to, complete, to, the, extent, that, the, standard, assumptions, of, astrodynamics, do, not, hold, actual, trajectories, will, vary, from, those, calculated, for, example, simple, atmospheric, drag, is, another, complicating, factor, for, objects, in, low, earth, orbit, these, rules, of, thumb, are, decidedly, inaccurate, when, describing, two, or, more, bodies, of, similar, mass, such, as, a, binary, star, system, see, n, body, problem, celestial, mechanics, uses, more, general, rules, applicable, to, a, wider, variety, of, situations, kepler, s, laws, of, planetary, motion, which, can, be, mathematically, derived, from, newton, s, laws, hold, strictly, only, in, describing, the, motion, of, two, gravitating, bodies, in, the, absence, of, non, gravitational, forces, they, also, describe, parabolic, and, hyperbolic, trajectories, in, the, close, proximity, of, large, objects, like, stars, the, differences, between, classical, mechanics, and, general, relativity, also, become, important, the, fundamental, laws, of, astrodynamics, are, newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, and, newton, s, laws, of, motion, while, the, fundamental, mathematical, tool, is, differential, calculus, in, a, newtonian, framework, the, laws, governing, orbits, and, trajectories, are, in, principle, time, symmetric, standard, assumptions, in, astrodynamics, include, non, interference, from, outside, bodies, negligible, mass, for, one, of, the, bodies, and, negligible, other, forces, such, as, from, the, solar, wind, atmospheric, drag, etc, more, accurate, calculations, can, be, made, without, these, simplifying, assumptions, but, they, are, more, complicated, the, increased, accuracy, often, does, not, make, enough, of, a, difference, in, the, calculation, to, be, worthwhile, kepler, s, laws, of, planetary, motion, may, be, derived, from, newton, s, laws, when, it, is, assumed, that, the, orbiting, body, is, subject, only, to, the, gravitational, force, of, the, central, attractor, when, an, engine, thrust, or, propulsive, force, is, present, newton, s, laws, still, apply, but, kepler, s, laws, are, invalidated, when, the, thrust, stops, the, resulting, orbit, will, be, different, but, will, once, again, be, described, by, kepler, s, laws, which, have, been, set, out, above, the, three, laws, are, the, formula, for, an, escape, velocity, is, derived, as, follows, the, specific, energy, energy, per, unit, mass, of, any, space, vehicle, is, composed, of, two, components, the, specific, potential, energy, and, the, specific, kinetic, energy, the, specific, potential, energy, associated, with, a, planet, of, mass, m, is, given, by, where, g, is, the, gravitational, constant, and, r, is, the, distance, between, the, two, bodies, while, the, specific, kinetic, energy, of, an, object, is, given, by, where, v, is, its, velocity, and, so, the, total, specific, orbital, energy, is, since, energy, is, conserved, displaystyle, epsilon, cannot, depend, on, the, distance, r, displaystyle, r, from, the, center, of, the, central, body, to, the, space, vehicle, in, question, i, e, v, must, vary, with, r, to, keep, the, specific, orbital, energy, constant, therefore, the, object, can, reach, infinite, r, displaystyle, r, only, if, this, quantity, is, nonnegative, which, implies, the, escape, velocity, from, the, earth, s, surface, is, about, 11, km, s, but, that, is, insufficient, to, send, the, body, an, infinite, distance, because, of, the, gravitational, pull, of, the, sun, to, escape, the, solar, system, from, a, location, at, a, distance, from, the, sun, equal, to, the, distance, sun, earth, but, not, close, to, the, earth, requires, around, 42, km, s, velocity, but, there, will, be, partial, credit, for, the, earth, s, orbital, velocity, for, spacecraft, launched, from, earth, if, their, further, acceleration, due, to, the, propulsion, system, carries, them, in, the, same, direction, as, earth, travels, in, its, orbit, orbits, are, conic, sections, so, the, formula, for, the, distance, of, a, body, for, a, given, angle, corresponds, to, the, formula, for, that, curve, in, polar, coordinates, which, is, displaystyle, mu, is, called, the, gravitational, parameter, m, 1, displaystyle, m, 1, and, m, 2, displaystyle, m, 2, are, the, masses, of, objects, 1, and, 2, and, h, displaystyle, h, is, the, specific, angular, momentum, of, object, 2, with, respect, to, object, 1, the, parameter, displaystyle, theta, is, known, as, the, true, anomaly, p, displaystyle, p, is, the, semi, latus, rectum, while, e, displaystyle, e, is, the, orbital, eccentricity, all, obtainable, from, the, various, forms, of, the, six, independent, orbital, elements, all, bounded, orbits, where, the, gravity, of, a, central, body, dominates, are, elliptical, in, nature, a, special, case, of, this, is, the, circular, orbit, which, is, an, ellipse, of, zero, eccentricity, the, formula, for, the, velocity, of, a, body, in, a, circular, orbit, at, distance, r, from, the, center, of, gravity, of, mass, m, can, be, derived, as, follows, centrifugal, acceleration, matches, the, acceleration, due, to, gravity, so, v, 2, r, g, m, r, 2, displaystyle, frac, v, 2, r, frac, gm, r, 2, therefore, where, g, displaystyle, g, is, the, gravitational, constant, equal, to, to, properly, use, this, formula, the, units, must, be, consistent, for, example, m, displaystyle, m, must, be, in, kilograms, and, r, displaystyle, r, must, be, in, meters, the, answer, will, be, in, meters, per, second, the, quantity, g, m, displaystyle, gm, is, often, termed, the, standard, gravitational, parameter, which, has, a, different, value, for, every, planet, or, moon, in, the, solar, system, once, the, circular, orbital, velocity, is, known, the, escape, velocity, is, easily, found, by, multiplying, by, 2, displaystyle, sqrt, 2, to, escape, from, gravity, the, kinetic, energy, must, at, least, match, the, negative, potential, energy, therefore, 1, 2, m, v, 2, g, m, m, r, displaystyle, frac, 1, 2, mv, 2, frac, gmm, r, if, 0, e, 1, displaystyle, 0, e, 1, then, the, denominator, of, the, equation, of, free, orbits, varies, with, the, true, anomaly, displaystyle, theta, but, remains, positive, never, becoming, zero, therefore, the, relative, position, vector, remains, bounded, having, its, smallest, magnitude, at, periapsis, r, p, displaystyle, r, p, which, is, given, by, the, maximum, value, r, displaystyle, r, is, reached, when, 180, displaystyle, theta, 180, circ, this, point, is, called, the, apoapsis, and, its, radial, coordinate, denoted, r, a, displaystyle, r, a, is, let, 2, a, displaystyle, 2a, be, the, distance, measured, along, the, apse, line, from, periapsis, p, displaystyle, p, to, apoapsis, a, displaystyle, a, as, illustrated, in, the, equation, below, substituting, the, equations, above, we, get, a, is, the, semimajor, axis, of, the, ellipse, solving, for, p, displaystyle, p, and, substituting, the, result, in, the, conic, section, curve, formula, above, we, get, under, standard, assumptions, the, orbital, period, t, displaystyle, t, of, a, body, traveling, along, an, elliptic, orbit, can, be, computed, as, where, conclusions, under, standard, assumptions, the, orbital, speed, v, displaystyle, v, of, a, body, traveling, along, an, elliptic, orbit, can, be, computed, from, the, vis, viva, equation, as, where, the, velocity, equation, for, a, hyperbolic, trajectory, is, v, 2, r, 1, a, displaystyle, v, sqrt, mu, left, 2, over, r, left, vert, 1, over, a, right, vert, right, under, standard, assumptions, specific, orbital, energy, displaystyle, epsilon, of, elliptic, orbit, is, negative, and, the, orbital, energy, conservation, equation, the, vis, viva, equation, for, this, orbit, can, take, the, form, where, conclusions, using, the, virial, theorem, we, find, if, the, eccentricity, equals, 1, then, the, orbit, equation, becomes, where, as, the, true, anomaly, approaches, 180, the, denominator, approaches, zero, so, that, r, tends, towards, infinity, hence, the, energy, of, the, trajectory, for, which, e, 1, is, zero, and, is, given, by, where, in, other, words, the, speed, anywhere, on, a, parabolic, path, is, if, e, 1, displaystyle, e, 1, the, orbit, formula, describes, the, geometry, of, the, hyperbolic, orbit, the, system, consists, of, two, symmetric, curves, the, orbiting, body, occupies, one, of, them, the, other, one, is, its, empty, mathematical, image, clearly, the, denominator, of, the, equation, above, goes, to, zero, when, cos, 1, e, displaystyle, cos, theta, 1, e, we, denote, this, value, of, true, anomaly, since, the, radial, distance, approaches, infinity, as, the, true, anomaly, approaches, displaystyle, theta, infty, known, as, the, true, anomaly, of, the, asymptote, observe, that, displaystyle, theta, infty, lies, between, 90, and, 180, from, the, trigonometric, identity, sin, 2, cos, 2, 1, displaystyle, sin, 2, theta, cos, 2, theta, 1, it, follows, that, under, standard, assumptions, specific, orbital, energy, displaystyle, epsilon, of, a, hyperbolic, trajectory, is, greater, than, zero, and, the, orbital, energy, conservation, equation, for, this, kind, of, trajectory, takes, form, where, under, standard, assumptions, the, body, traveling, along, a, hyperbolic, trajectory, will, attain, at, r, displaystyle, r, infinity, an, orbital, velocity, called, hyperbolic, excess, velocity, v, displaystyle, v, infty, that, can, be, computed, as, where, the, hyperbolic, excess, velocity, is, related, to, the, specific, orbital, energy, or, characteristic, energy, by, one, approach, to, calculating, orbits, mainly, used, historically, is, to, use, kepler, s, equation, where, m, is, the, mean, anomaly, e, is, the, eccentric, anomaly, and, displaystyle, epsilon, is, the, eccentricity, with, kepler, s, formula, finding, the, time, of, flight, to, reach, an, angle, true, anomaly, of, displaystyle, theta, from, periapsis, is, broken, into, two, steps, finding, the, eccentric, anomaly, at, a, given, time, the, inverse, problem, is, more, difficult, kepler, s, equation, is, transcendental, in, e, displaystyle, e, meaning, it, cannot, be, solved, for, e, displaystyle, e, algebraically, kepler, s, equation, can, be, solved, for, e, displaystyle, e, analytically, by, inversion, a, solution, of, kepler, s, equation, valid, for, all, real, values, of, displaystyle, textstyle, epsilon, is, e, n, 1, m, n, 3, n, lim, 0, d, n, 1, d, n, 1, sin, 3, n, 1, n, 1, m, n, n, lim, 0, d, n, 1, d, n, 1, sin, n, 1, displaystyle, e,

for, time, of, flight, then, adjust, e, displaystyle, e, as, necessary, to, bring, the, computed, time, of, flight, closer, to, the, desired, value, until, the, required, precision, is, achieved, usually, newton, s, method, is, used, to, achieve, relatively, fast, convergence, the, main, difficulty, with, this, approach, is, that, it, can, take, prohibitively, long, to, converge, for, the, extreme, elliptical, orbits, for, near, parabolic, orbits, eccentricity, displaystyle, epsilon, is, nearly, 1, and, substituting, e, 1, displaystyle, e, 1, into, the, formula, for, mean, anomaly, e, sin, e, displaystyle, e, sin, e, we, find, ourselves, subtracting, two, nearly, equal, values, and, accuracy, suffers, for, near, circular, orbits, it, is, hard, to, find, the, periapsis, in, the, first, place, and, truly, circular, orbits, have, no, periapsis, at, all, furthermore, the, equation, was, derived, on, the, assumption, of, an, elliptical, orbit, and, so, it, does, not, hold, for, parabolic, or, hyperbolic, orbits, these, difficulties, are, what, led, to, the, development, of, the, universal, variable, formulation, described, below, for, simple, procedures, such, as, computing, the, delta, v, for, coplanar, transfer, ellipses, traditional, approaches, are, fairly, effective, others, such, as, time, of, flight, are, far, more, complicated, especially, for, near, circular, and, hyperbolic, orbits, the, hohmann, transfer, orbit, alone, is, a, poor, approximation, for, interplanetary, trajectories, because, it, neglects, the, planets, own, gravity, planetary, gravity, dominates, the, behavior, of, the, spacecraft, in, the, vicinity, of, a, planet, and, in, most, cases, hohmann, severely, overestimates, delta, v, and, produces, highly, inaccurate, prescriptions, for, burn, timings, a, relatively, simple, way, to, get, a, first, order, approximation, of, delta, v, is, based, on, the, patched, conic, approximation, technique, one, must, choose, the, one, dominant, gravitating, body, in, each, region, of, space, through, which, the, trajectory, will, pass, and, to, model, only, that, body, s, effects, in, that, region, for, instance, on, a, trajectory, from, the, earth, to, mars, one, would, begin, by, considering, only, the, earth, s, gravity, until, the, trajectory, reaches, a, distance, where, the, earth, s, gravity, no, longer, dominates, that, of, the, sun, the, spacecraft, would, be, given, escape, velocity, to, send, it, on, its, way, to, interplanetary, space, next, one, would, consider, only, the, sun, s, gravity, until, the, trajectory, reaches, the, neighborhood, of, mars, during, this, stage, the, transfer, orbit, model, is, appropriate, finally, only, mars, s, gravity, is, considered, during, the, final, portion, of, the, trajectory, where, mars, s, gravity, dominates, the, spacecraft, s, behavior, the, spacecraft, would, approach, mars, on, a, hyperbolic, orbit, and, a, final, retrograde, burn, would, slow, the, spacecraft, enough, to, be, captured, by, mars, friedrich, zander, was, one, of, the, first, to, apply, the, patched, conics, approach, for, astrodynamics, purposes, when, proposing, the, use, of, intermediary, bodies, gravity, for, interplanetary, travels, in, what, is, known, today, as, a, gravity, assist, the, size, of, the, neighborhoods, or, spheres, of, influence, vary, with, radius, r, s, o, i, displaystyle, r, soi, where, a, p, displaystyle, a, p, is, the, semimajor, axis, of, the, planet, s, orbit, relative, to, the, sun, m, p, displaystyle, m, p, and, m, s, displaystyle, m, s, are, the, masses, of, the, planet, and, sun, respectively, this, simplification, is, sufficient, to, compute, rough, estimates, of, fuel, requirements, and, rough, time, of, flight, estimates, but, it, is, not, generally, accurate, enough, to, guide, a, spacecraft, to, its, destination, for, that, numerical, methods, are, required, to, address, computational, shortcomings, of, traditional, approaches, for, solving, the, 2, body, problem, the, universal, variable, formulation, was, developed, it, works, equally, well, for, the, circular, elliptical, parabolic, and, hyperbolic, cases, the, differential, equations, converging, well, when, integrated, for, any, orbit, it, also, generalizes, well, to, problems, incorporating, perturbation, theory, the, universal, variable, formulation, works, well, with, the, variation, of, parameters, technique, except, now, instead, of, the, six, keplerian, orbital, elements, we, use, a, different, set, of, orbital, elements, namely, the, satellite, s, initial, position, and, velocity, vectors, x, 0, displaystyle, x, 0, and, v, 0, displaystyle, v, 0, at, a, given, epoch, t, 0, displaystyle, t, 0, in, a, two, body, simulation, these, elements, are, sufficient, to, compute, the, satellite, s, position, and, velocity, at, any, time, in, the, future, using, the, universal, variable, formulation, conversely, at, any, moment, in, the, satellite, s, orbit, we, can, measure, its, position, and, velocity, and, then, use, the, universal, variable, approach, to, determine, what, its, initial, position, and, velocity, would, have, been, at, the, epoch, in, perfect, two, body, motion, these, orbital, elements, would, be, invariant, just, like, the, keplerian, elements, would, be, however, perturbations, cause, the, orbital, elements, to, change, over, time, hence, the, position, element, is, written, as, x, 0, t, displaystyle, x, 0, t, and, the, velocity, element, as, v, 0, t, displaystyle, v, 0, t, indicating, that, they, vary, with, time, the, technique, to, compute, the, effect, of, perturbations, becomes, one, of, finding, expressions, either, exact, or, approximate, for, the, functions, x, 0, t, displaystyle, x, 0, t, and, v, 0, t, displaystyle, v, 0, t, the, following, are, some, effects, which, make, real, orbits, differ, from, the, simple, models, based, on, a, spherical, earth, most, of, them, can, be, handled, on, short, timescales, perhaps, less, than, a, few, thousand, orbits, by, perturbation, theory, because, they, are, small, relative, to, the, corresponding, two, body, effects, over, very, long, timescales, perhaps, millions, of, orbits, even, small, perturbations, can, dominate, and, the, behavior, can, become, chaotic, on, the, other, hand, the, various, perturbations, can, be, orchestrated, by, clever, astrodynamicists, to, assist, with, orbit, maintenance, tasks, such, as, station, keeping, ground, track, maintenance, or, adjustment, or, phasing, of, perigee, to, cover, selected, targets, at, low, altitude, in, spaceflight, an, orbital, maneuver, is, the, use, of, propulsion, systems, to, change, the, orbit, of, a, spacecraft, for, spacecraft, far, from, earth, for, example, those, in, orbits, around, the, sun, an, orbital, maneuver, is, called, a, deep, space, maneuver, dsm, transfer, orbits, are, usually, elliptical, orbits, that, allow, spacecraft, to, move, from, one, usually, substantially, circular, orbit, to, another, usually, they, require, a, burn, at, the, start, a, burn, at, the, end, and, sometimes, one, or, more, burns, in, the, middle, for, the, case, of, orbital, transfer, between, non, coplanar, orbits, the, change, of, plane, thrust, must, be, made, at, the, point, where, the, orbital, planes, intersect, the, node, as, the, objective, is, to, change, the, direction, of, the, velocity, vector, by, an, angle, equal, to, the, angle, between, the, planes, almost, all, of, this, thrust, should, be, made, when, the, spacecraft, is, at, the, node, near, the, apoapse, when, the, magnitude, of, the, velocity, vector, is, at, its, lowest, however, a, small, fraction, of, the, orbital, inclination, change, can, be, made, at, the, node, near, the, periapse, by, slightly, angling, the, transfer, orbit, injection, thrust, in, the, direction, of, the, desired, inclination, change, this, works, because, the, cosine, of, a, small, angle, is, very, nearly, one, resulting, in, the, small, plane, change, being, effectively, free, despite, the, high, velocity, of, the, spacecraft, near, periapse, as, the, oberth, effect, due, to, the, increased, slightly, angled, thrust, exceeds, the, cost, of, the, thrust, in, the, orbit, normal, axis, in, a, gravity, assist, a, spacecraft, swings, by, a, planet, and, leaves, in, a, different, direction, at, a, different, speed, this, is, useful, to, speed, or, slow, a, spacecraft, instead, of, carrying, more, fuel, this, maneuver, can, be, approximated, by, an, elastic, collision, at, large, distances, though, the, flyby, does, not, involve, any, physical, contact, due, to, newton, s, third, law, equal, and, opposite, reaction, any, momentum, gained, by, a, spacecraft, must, be, lost, by, the, planet, or, vice, versa, however, because, the, planet, is, much, much, more, massive, than, the, spacecraft, the, effect, on, the, planet, s, orbit, is, negligible, the, oberth, effect, can, be, employed, particularly, during, a, gravity, assist, operation, this, effect, is, that, use, of, a, propulsion, system, works, better, at, high, speeds, and, hence, course, changes, are, best, done, when, close, to, a, gravitating, body, this, can, multiply, the, effective, delta, v, it, is, now, possible, to, use, computers, to, search, for, routes, using, the, nonlinearities, in, the, gravity, of, the, planets, and, moons, of, the, solar, system, for, example, it, is, possible, to, plot, an, orbit, from, high, earth, orbit, to, mars, passing, close, to, one, of, the, earth, s, trojan, points, collectively, referred, to, as, the, interplanetary, transport, network, these, highly, perturbative, even, chaotic, orbital, trajectories, in, principle, need, no, fuel, beyond, that, needed, to, reach, the, lagrange, point, in, practice, keeping, to, the, trajectory, requires, some, course, corrections, the, biggest, problem, with, them, is, they, can, be, exceedingly, slow, taking, many, years, in, addition, launch, windows, can, be, very, far, apart, they, have, however, been, employed, on, projects, such, as, genesis, this, spacecraft, visited, the, earth, sun, l, 1, point, and, returned, using, very, little, propellant, many, of, the, options, procedures, and, supporting, theory, are, covered, in, standard, works, such,
