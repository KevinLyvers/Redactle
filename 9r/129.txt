the, small, magellanic, cloud, smc, is, a, dwarf, galaxy, near, the, milky, way, classified, as, a, dwarf, irregular, galaxy, the, smc, has, a, d, 25, isophotal, diameter, of, about, 5, 78, kiloparsecs, 18, 900, light, years, and, contains, several, hundred, million, stars, it, has, a, total, mass, of, approximately, 7, billion, solar, masses, at, a, distance, of, about, 200, 000, light, years, the, smc, is, among, the, nearest, intergalactic, neighbors, of, the, milky, way, and, is, one, of, the, most, distant, objects, visible, to, the, naked, eye, the, smc, is, visible, from, the, entire, southern, hemisphere, and, can, be, fully, glimpsed, low, above, the, southern, horizon, from, latitudes, south, of, about, 15, north, the, galaxy, is, located, across, the, constellation, of, tucana, and, part, of, hydrus, appearing, as, a, faint, hazy, patch, resembling, a, detached, piece, of, the, milky, way, the, smc, has, an, average, apparent, diameter, of, about, 4, 2, 8, times, the, moon, s, and, thus, covers, an, area, of, about, 14, square, degrees, 70, times, the, moon, s, since, its, surface, brightness, is, very, low, this, deep, sky, object, is, best, seen, on, clear, moonless, nights, and, away, from, city, lights, the, smc, forms, a, pair, with, the, large, magellanic, cloud, lmc, which, lies, 20, to, the, east, and, like, the, lmc, is, a, member, of, the, local, group, it, is, currently, a, satellite, of, the, milky, way, but, is, likely, a, former, satellite, of, the, lmc, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, magellanic, clouds, have, long, been, included, in, the, lore, of, native, inhabitants, including, south, sea, islanders, and, indigenous, australians, persian, astronomer, al, sufi, mentions, them, in, his, book, of, fixed, stars, repeating, a, quote, by, the, polymath, ibn, qutaybah, but, had, not, observed, them, himself, european, sailors, may, have, first, noticed, the, clouds, during, the, middle, ages, when, they, were, used, for, navigation, portuguese, and, dutch, sailors, called, them, the, cape, clouds, a, name, that, was, retained, for, several, centuries, during, the, circumnavigation, of, the, earth, by, ferdinand, magellan, in, 1519, 1522, they, were, described, by, antonio, pigafetta, as, dim, clusters, of, stars, in, johann, bayer, s, celestial, atlas, uranometria, published, in, 1603, he, named, the, smaller, cloud, nubecula, minor, in, latin, nubecula, means, a, little, cloud, between, 1834, and, 1838, john, frederick, william, herschel, made, observations, of, the, southern, skies, with, his, 14, inch, 36, cm, reflector, from, the, royal, observatory, while, observing, the, nubecula, minor, he, described, it, as, a, cloudy, mass, of, light, with, an, oval, shape, and, a, bright, center, within, the, area, of, this, cloud, he, catalogued, a, concentration, of, 37, nebulae, and, clusters, in, 1891, harvard, college, observatory, opened, an, observing, station, at, arequipa, in, peru, between, 1893, and, 1906, under, the, direction, of, solon, bailey, the, 24, inch, 610, mm, telescope, at, this, site, was, used, to, survey, photographically, both, the, large, and, small, magellanic, clouds, henrietta, swan, leavitt, an, astronomer, at, the, harvard, college, observatory, used, the, plates, from, arequipa, to, study, the, variations, in, relative, luminosity, of, stars, in, the, smc, in, 1908, the, results, of, her, study, were, published, which, showed, that, a, type, of, variable, star, called, a, cluster, variable, later, called, a, cepheid, variable, after, the, prototype, star, delta, cephei, showed, a, definite, relationship, between, the, variability, period, and, the, star, s, apparent, brightness, leavitt, realized, that, since, all, the, stars, in, the, smc, are, roughly, the, same, distance, from, earth, this, result, implied, that, there, is, similar, relationship, between, period, and, absolute, brightness, this, important, period, luminosity, relation, allowed, the, distance, to, any, other, cepheid, variable, to, be, estimated, in, terms, of, the, distance, to, the, smc, she, hoped, a, few, cepheid, variables, could, be, found, close, enough, to, earth, so, that, their, parallax, and, hence, distance, from, earth, could, be, measured, this, soon, happened, allowing, cepheid, variables, to, be, used, as, standard, candles, facilitating, many, astronomical, discoveries, using, this, period, luminosity, relation, in, 1913, the, distance, to, the, smc, was, first, estimated, by, ejnar, hertzsprung, first, he, measured, thirteen, nearby, cepheid, variables, to, find, the, absolute, magnitude, of, a, variable, with, a, period, of, one, day, by, comparing, this, to, the, periodicity, of, the, variables, as, measured, by, leavitt, he, was, able, to, estimate, a, distance, of, 10, 000, parsecs, 30, 000, light, years, between, the, sun, and, the, smc, this, later, proved, to, be, a, gross, underestimate, of, the, true, distance, but, it, did, demonstrate, the, potential, usefulness, of, this, technique, announced, in, 2006, measurements, with, the, hubble, space, telescope, suggest, the, large, and, small, magellanic, clouds, may, be, moving, too, fast, to, be, orbiting, the, milky, way, the, smc, contains, a, central, bar, structure, and, astronomers, speculate, that, it, was, once, a, barred, spiral, galaxy, that, was, disrupted, by, the, milky, way, to, become, somewhat, irregular, there, is, a, bridge, of, gas, connecting, the, small, magellanic, cloud, with, the, large, magellanic, cloud, lmc, which, is, evidence, of, tidal, interaction, between, the, galaxies, this, bridge, of, gas, is, a, star, forming, site, the, magellanic, clouds, have, a, common, envelope, of, neutral, hydrogen, indicating, they, have, been, gravitationally, bound, for, a, long, time, in, 2017, using, the, dark, energy, survey, plus, maglites, data, a, stellar, over, density, associated, with, the, small, magellanic, cloud, was, discovered, which, is, probably, the, result, of, interactions, between, the, smc, and, lmc, the, small, magellanic, cloud, contains, a, large, and, active, population, of, x, ray, binaries, recent, star, formation, has, led, to, a, large, population, of, massive, stars, and, high, mass, x, ray, binaries, hmxbs, which, are, the, relics, of, the, short, lived, upper, end, of, the, initial, mass, function, the, young, stellar, population, and, the, majority, of, the, known, x, ray, binaries, are, concentrated, in, the, smc, s, bar, hmxb, pulsars, are, rotating, neutron, stars, in, binary, systems, with, be, type, spectral, type, 09, b2, luminosity, classes, v, iii, or, supergiant, stellar, companions, most, hmxbs, are, of, the, be, type, which, account, for, 70, in, the, milky, way, and, 98, in, the, smc, the, be, star, equatorial, disk, provides, a, reservoir, of, matter, that, can, be, accreted, onto, the, neutron, star, during, periastron, passage, most, known, systems, have, large, orbital, eccentricity, or, during, large, scale, disk, ejection, episodes, this, scenario, leads, to, strings, of, x, ray, outbursts, with, typical, x, ray, luminosities, l, x, 10, 36, 10, 37, erg, s, spaced, at, the, orbital, period, plus, infrequent, giant, outbursts, of, greater, duration, and, luminosity, monitoring, surveys, of, the, smc, performed, with, nasa, s, rossi, x, ray, timing, explorer, rxte, see, x, ray, pulsars, in, outburst, at, more, than, 10, 36, erg, s, and, have, counted, 50, by, the, end, of, 2008, the, rosat, and, asca, missions, detected, many, faint, x, ray, point, sources, but, the, typical, positional, uncertainties, frequently, made, positive, identification, difficult, recent, studies, using, xmm, newton, and, chandra, have, now, cataloged, several, hundred, x, ray, sources, in, the, direction, of, the, smc, of, which, perhaps, half, are, considered, likely, hmxbs, and, the, remainder, a, mix, of, foreground, stars, and, background, agn, no, x, rays, above, background, were, observed, from, the, magellanic, clouds, during, the, september, 20, 1966, nike, tomahawk, flight, balloon, observation, from, mildura, australia, on, october, 24, 1967, of, the, smc, set, an, upper, limit, of, x, ray, detection, an, x, ray, astronomy, instrument, was, carried, aboard, a, thor, missile, launched, from, johnston, atoll, on, september, 24, 1970, at, 12, 54, utc, for, altitudes, above, 300, km, to, search, for, the, small, magellanic, cloud, the, smc, was, detected, with, an, x, ray, luminosity, of, 5, 10, 38, erg, s, in, the, range, 1, 5, 12, kev, and, 2, 5, 10, 39, erg, s, in, the, range, 5, 50, kev, for, an, apparently, extended, source, the, fourth, uhuru, catalog, lists, an, early, x, ray, source, within, the, constellation, tucana, 4u, 0115, 73, 3u, 0115, 73, 2a, 0116, 737, smc, x, 1, uhuru, observed, the, smc, on, january, 1, 12, 13, 16, and, 17, 1971, and, detected, one, source, located, at, 01149, 7342, which, was, then, designated, smc, x, 1, some, x, ray, counts, were, also, received, on, january, 14, 15, 18, and, 19, 1971, the, third, ariel, 5, catalog, 3a, also, contains, this, early, x, ray, source, within, tucana, 3a, 0116, 736, 2a, 0116, 737, smc, x, 1, the, smc, x, 1, a, hmxrb, is, at, j2000, right, ascension, ra, 01, h, 15, m, 14, s, declination, dec, 73, 42, 22, two, additional, sources, detected, and, listed, in, 3a, include, smc, x, 2, at, 3a, 0042, 738, and, smc, x, 3, at, 3a, 0049, 726, it, has, been, proposed, by, astrophysicists, d, s, mathewson, v, l, ford, and, n, visvanathan, that, the, smc, may, in, fact, be, split, in, two, with, a, smaller, section, of, this, galaxy, behind, the, main, part, of, the, smc, as, seen, from, earth, perspective, and, separated, by, about, 30, 000, ly, they, suggest, the, reason, for, this, is, due, to, a, past, interaction, with, the, lmc, that, split, the, smc, and, that, the, two, sections, are, still, moving, apart, they, dubbed, this, smaller, remnant, the, mini, magellanic, cloud, in, 2023, it, was, reported, that, the, smc, is, indeed, two, separate, structures, with, distinct, stellar, and, gaseous, chemical, compositions, separated, by, around, 5, kiloparsecs
