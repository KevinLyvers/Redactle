a, nebula, latin, for, cloud, fog, pl, nebulae, nebul, or, nebulas, is, a, distinct, luminescent, part, of, interstellar, medium, which, can, consist, of, ionized, neutral, or, molecular, hydrogen, and, also, cosmic, dust, nebulae, are, often, star, forming, regions, such, as, in, the, pillars, of, creation, in, the, eagle, nebula, in, these, regions, the, formations, of, gas, dust, and, other, materials, clump, together, to, form, denser, regions, which, attract, further, matter, and, eventually, become, dense, enough, to, form, stars, the, remaining, material, is, then, thought, to, form, planets, and, other, planetary, system, objects, most, nebulae, are, of, vast, size, some, are, hundreds, of, light, years, in, diameter, a, nebula, that, is, visible, to, the, human, eye, from, earth, would, appear, larger, but, no, brighter, from, close, by, the, orion, nebula, the, brightest, nebula, in, the, sky, and, occupying, an, area, twice, the, angular, diameter, of, the, full, moon, can, be, viewed, with, the, naked, eye, but, was, missed, by, early, astronomers, although, denser, than, the, space, surrounding, them, most, nebulae, are, far, less, dense, than, any, vacuum, created, on, earth, 10, 5, to, 10, 7, molecules, per, cubic, centimeter, a, nebular, cloud, the, size, of, the, earth, would, have, a, total, mass, of, only, a, few, kilograms, earth, s, air, has, a, density, of, approximately, 10, 19, molecules, per, cubic, centimeter, by, contrast, the, densest, nebulae, can, have, densities, of, 10, 4, molecules, per, cubic, centimeter, many, nebulae, are, visible, due, to, fluorescence, caused, by, embedded, hot, stars, while, others, are, so, diffused, that, they, can, be, detected, only, with, long, exposures, and, special, filters, some, nebulae, are, variably, illuminated, by, t, tauri, variable, stars, originally, the, term, nebula, was, used, to, describe, any, diffused, astronomical, object, including, galaxies, beyond, the, milky, way, the, andromeda, galaxy, for, instance, was, once, referred, to, as, the, andromeda, nebula, and, spiral, galaxies, in, general, as, spiral, nebulae, before, the, true, nature, of, galaxies, was, confirmed, in, the, early, 20th, century, by, vesto, slipher, edwin, hubble, and, others, edwin, hubble, discovered, that, most, nebulae, are, associated, with, stars, and, illuminated, by, starlight, he, also, helped, categorize, nebulae, based, on, the, type, of, light, spectra, they, produced, around, 150, ad, ptolemy, recorded, in, books, vii, viii, of, his, almagest, five, stars, that, appeared, nebulous, he, also, noted, a, region, of, nebulosity, between, the, constellations, ursa, major, and, leo, that, was, not, associated, with, any, star, the, first, true, nebula, as, distinct, from, a, star, cluster, was, mentioned, by, the, muslim, persian, astronomer, abd, al, rahman, al, sufi, in, his, book, of, fixed, stars, 964, he, noted, a, little, cloud, where, the, andromeda, galaxy, is, located, he, also, cataloged, the, omicron, velorum, star, cluster, as, a, nebulous, star, and, other, nebulous, objects, such, as, brocchi, s, cluster, the, supernova, that, created, the, crab, nebula, sn, 1054, was, observed, by, arabic, and, chinese, astronomers, in, 1054, in, 1610, nicolas, claude, fabri, de, peiresc, discovered, the, orion, nebula, using, a, telescope, this, nebula, was, also, observed, by, johann, baptist, cysat, in, 1618, however, the, first, detailed, study, of, the, orion, nebula, was, not, performed, until, 1659, by, christiaan, huygens, who, also, believed, he, was, the, first, person, to, discover, this, nebulosity, in, 1715, edmond, halley, published, a, list, of, six, nebulae, this, number, steadily, increased, during, the, century, with, jean, philippe, de, cheseaux, compiling, a, list, of, 20, including, eight, not, previously, known, in, 1746, from, 1751, to, 1753, nicolas, louis, de, lacaille, cataloged, 42, nebulae, from, the, cape, of, good, hope, most, of, which, were, previously, unknown, charles, messier, then, compiled, a, catalog, of, 103, nebulae, now, called, messier, objects, which, included, what, are, now, known, to, be, galaxies, by, 1781, his, interest, was, detecting, comets, and, these, were, objects, that, might, be, mistaken, for, them, the, number, of, nebulae, was, then, greatly, increased, by, the, efforts, of, william, herschel, and, his, sister, caroline, herschel, their, catalogue, of, one, thousand, new, nebulae, and, clusters, of, stars, was, published, in, 1786, a, second, catalog, of, a, thousand, was, published, in, 1789, and, the, third, and, final, catalog, of, 510, appeared, in, 1802, during, much, of, their, work, william, herschel, believed, that, these, nebulae, were, merely, unresolved, clusters, of, stars, in, 1790, however, he, discovered, a, star, surrounded, by, nebulosity, and, concluded, that, this, was, a, true, nebulosity, rather, than, a, more, distant, cluster, beginning, in, 1864, william, huggins, examined, the, spectra, of, about, 70, nebulae, he, found, that, roughly, a, third, of, them, had, the, emission, spectrum, of, a, gas, the, rest, showed, a, continuous, spectrum, and, were, thus, thought, to, consist, of, a, mass, of, stars, a, third, category, was, added, in, 1912, when, vesto, slipher, showed, that, the, spectrum, of, the, nebula, that, surrounded, the, star, merope, matched, the, spectra, of, the, pleiades, open, cluster, thus, the, nebula, radiates, by, reflected, star, light, in, 1923, following, the, great, debate, it, became, clear, that, many, nebulae, were, in, fact, galaxies, far, from, the, milky, way, slipher, and, edwin, hubble, continued, to, collect, the, spectra, from, many, different, nebulae, finding, 29, that, showed, emission, spectra, and, 33, that, had, the, continuous, spectra, of, star, light, in, 1922, hubble, announced, that, nearly, all, nebulae, are, associated, with, stars, and, that, their, illumination, comes, from, star, light, he, also, discovered, that, the, emission, spectrum, nebulae, are, nearly, always, associated, with, stars, having, spectral, classifications, of, b, or, hotter, including, all, o, type, main, sequence, stars, while, nebulae, with, continuous, spectra, appear, with, cooler, stars, both, hubble, and, henry, norris, russell, concluded, that, the, nebulae, surrounding, the, hotter, stars, are, transformed, in, some, manner, there, are, a, variety, of, formation, mechanisms, for, the, different, types, of, nebulae, some, nebulae, form, from, gas, that, is, already, in, the, interstellar, medium, while, others, are, produced, by, stars, examples, of, the, former, case, are, giant, molecular, clouds, the, coldest, densest, phase, of, interstellar, gas, which, can, form, by, the, cooling, and, condensation, of, more, diffuse, gas, examples, of, the, latter, case, are, planetary, nebulae, formed, from, material, shed, by, a, star, in, late, stages, of, its, stellar, evolution, star, forming, regions, are, a, class, of, emission, nebula, associated, with, giant, molecular, clouds, these, form, as, a, molecular, cloud, collapses, under, its, own, weight, producing, stars, massive, stars, may, form, in, the, center, and, their, ultraviolet, radiation, ionizes, the, surrounding, gas, making, it, visible, at, optical, wavelengths, the, region, of, ionized, hydrogen, surrounding, the, massive, stars, is, known, as, an, h, ii, region, while, the, shells, of, neutral, hydrogen, surrounding, the, h, ii, region, are, known, as, photodissociation, region, examples, of, star, forming, regions, are, the, orion, nebula, the, rosette, nebula, and, the, omega, nebula, feedback, from, star, formation, in, the, form, of, supernova, explosions, of, massive, stars, stellar, winds, or, ultraviolet, radiation, from, massive, stars, or, outflows, from, low, mass, stars, may, disrupt, the, cloud, destroying, the, nebula, after, several, million, years, other, nebulae, form, as, the, result, of, supernova, explosions, the, death, throes, of, massive, short, lived, stars, the, materials, thrown, off, from, the, supernova, explosion, are, then, ionized, by, the, energy, and, the, compact, object, that, its, core, produces, one, of, the, best, examples, of, this, is, the, crab, nebula, in, taurus, the, supernova, event, was, recorded, in, the, year, 1054, and, is, labeled, sn, 1054, the, compact, object, that, was, created, after, the, explosion, lies, in, the, center, of, the, crab, nebula, and, its, core, is, now, a, neutron, star, still, other, nebulae, form, as, planetary, nebulae, this, is, the, final, stage, of, a, low, mass, star, s, life, like, earth, s, sun, stars, with, a, mass, up, to, 8, 10, solar, masses, evolve, into, red, giants, and, slowly, lose, their, outer, layers, during, pulsations, in, their, atmospheres, when, a, star, has, lost, enough, material, its, temperature, increases, and, the, ultraviolet, radiation, it, emits, can, ionize, the, surrounding, nebula, that, it, has, thrown, off, the, sun, will, produce, a, planetary, nebula, and, its, core, will, remain, behind, in, the, form, of, a, white, dwarf, objects, named, nebulae, belong, to, four, major, groups, before, their, nature, was, understood, galaxies, spiral, nebulae, and, star, clusters, too, distant, to, be, resolved, as, stars, were, also, classified, as, nebulae, but, no, longer, are, not, all, cloud, like, structures, are, nebulae, herbig, haro, objects, are, an, example, integrated, flux, nebulae, are, a, relatively, recently, identified, astronomical, phenomenon, in, contrast, to, the, typical, and, well, known, gaseous, nebulae, within, the, plane, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, ifns, lie, beyond, the, main, body, of, the, galaxy, most, nebulae, can, be, described, as, diffuse, nebulae, which, means, that, they, are, extended, and, contain, no, well, defined, boundaries, diffuse, nebulae, can, be, divided, into, emission, nebulae, reflection, nebulae, and, dark, nebulae, visible, light, nebulae, may, be, divided, into, emission, nebulae, which, emit, spectral, line, radiation, from, excited, or, ionized, gas, mostly, ionized, hydrogen, they, are, often, called, h, ii, regions, h, ii, referring, to, ionized, hydrogen, and, reflection, nebulae, which, are, visible, primarily, due, to, the, light, they, reflect, reflection, nebulae, themselves, do, not, emit, significant, amounts, of, visible, light, but, are, near, stars, and, reflect, light, from, them, similar, nebulae, not, illuminated, by, stars, do, not, exhibit, visible, radiation, but, may, be, detected, as, opaque, clouds, blocking, light, from, luminous, objects, behind, them, they, are, called, dark, nebulae, although, these, nebulae, have, different, visibility, at, optical, wavelengths, they, are, all, bright, sources, of, infrared, emission, chiefly, from, dust, within, the, nebulae, planetary, nebulae, are, the, remnants, of, the, final, stages, of, stellar, evolution, for, mid, mass, stars, varying, in, size, between, 0, 5, 8, solar, masses, evolved, asymptotic, giant, branch, stars, expel, their, outer, layers, outwards, due, to, strong, stellar, winds, thus, forming, gaseous, shells, while, leaving, behind, the, star, s, core, in, the, form, of, a, white, dwarf, radiation, from, the, hot, white, dwarf, excites, the, expelled, gases, producing, emission, nebulae, with, spectra, similar, to, those, of, emission, nebulae, found, in, star, formation, regions, they, are, h, ii, regions, because, mostly, hydrogen, is, ionized, but, planetary, are, denser, and, more, compact, than, nebulae, found, in, star, formation, regions, planetary, nebulae, were, given, their, name, by, the, first, astronomical, observers, who, were, initially, unable, to, distinguish, them, from, planets, and, who, tended, to, confuse, them, with, planets, which, were, of, more, interest, to, them, the, sun, is, expected, to, spawn, a, planetary, nebula, about, 12, billion, years, after, its, formation, a, supernova, occurs, when, a, high, mass, star, reaches, the, end, of, its, life, when, nuclear, fusion, in, the, core, of, the, star, stops, the, star, collapses, the, gas, falling, inward, either, rebounds, or, gets, so, strongly, heated, that, it, expands, outwards, from, the, core, thus, causing, the, star, to, explode, the, expanding, shell, of, gas, forms, a, supernova, remnant, a, special, diffuse, nebula, although, much, of, the, optical, and, x, ray, emission, from, supernova, remnants, originates, from, ionized, gas, a, great, amount, of, the, radio, emission, is, a, form, of, non, thermal, emission, called, synchrotron, emission, this, emission, originates, from, high, velocity, electrons, oscillating, within, magnetic, fields
