in, chemistry, there, are, three, definitions, in, common, use, of, the, word, base, arrhenius, bases, br, nsted, bases, and, lewis, bases, all, definitions, agree, that, bases, are, substances, that, react, with, acids, as, originally, proposed, by, g, f, rouelle, in, the, mid, 18th, century, in, 1884, svante, arrhenius, proposed, that, a, base, is, a, substance, which, dissociates, in, aqueous, solution, to, form, hydroxide, ions, oh, these, ions, can, react, with, hydrogen, ions, h, according, to, arrhenius, from, the, dissociation, of, acids, to, form, water, in, an, acid, base, reaction, a, base, was, therefore, a, metal, hydroxide, such, as, naoh, or, ca, oh, 2, such, aqueous, hydroxide, solutions, were, also, described, by, certain, characteristic, properties, they, are, slippery, to, the, touch, can, taste, bitter, and, change, the, color, of, ph, indicators, e, g, turn, red, litmus, paper, blue, in, water, by, altering, the, autoionization, equilibrium, bases, yield, solutions, in, which, the, hydrogen, ion, activity, is, lower, than, it, is, in, pure, water, i, e, the, water, has, a, ph, higher, than, 7, 0, at, standard, conditions, a, soluble, base, is, called, an, alkali, if, it, contains, and, releases, oh, ions, quantitatively, metal, oxides, hydroxides, and, especially, alkoxides, are, basic, and, conjugate, bases, of, weak, acids, are, weak, bases, bases, and, acids, are, seen, as, chemical, opposites, because, the, effect, of, an, acid, is, to, increase, the, hydronium, h, 3, o, concentration, in, water, whereas, bases, reduce, this, concentration, a, reaction, between, aqueous, solutions, of, an, acid, and, a, base, is, called, neutralization, producing, a, solution, of, water, and, a, salt, in, which, the, salt, separates, into, its, component, ions, if, the, aqueous, solution, is, saturated, with, a, given, salt, solute, any, additional, such, salt, precipitates, out, of, the, solution, in, the, more, general, br, nsted, lowry, acid, base, theory, 1923, a, base, is, a, substance, that, can, accept, hydrogen, cations, h, otherwise, known, as, protons, this, does, include, aqueous, hydroxides, since, oh, does, react, with, h, to, form, water, so, that, arrhenius, bases, are, a, subset, of, br, nsted, bases, however, there, are, also, other, br, nsted, bases, which, accept, protons, such, as, aqueous, solutions, of, ammonia, nh, 3, or, its, organic, derivatives, amines, these, bases, do, not, contain, a, hydroxide, ion, but, nevertheless, react, with, water, resulting, in, an, increase, in, the, concentration, of, hydroxide, ion, also, some, non, aqueous, solvents, contain, br, nsted, bases, which, react, with, solvated, protons, for, example, in, liquid, ammonia, nh, 2, is, the, basic, ion, species, which, accepts, protons, from, nh, 4, the, acidic, species, in, this, solvent, g, n, lewis, realized, that, water, ammonia, and, other, bases, can, form, a, bond, with, a, proton, due, to, the, unshared, pair, of, electrons, that, the, bases, possess, in, the, lewis, theory, a, base, is, an, electron, pair, donor, which, can, share, a, pair, of, electrons, with, an, electron, acceptor, which, is, described, as, a, lewis, acid, the, lewis, theory, is, more, general, than, the, br, nsted, model, because, the, lewis, acid, is, not, necessarily, a, proton, but, can, be, another, molecule, or, ion, with, a, vacant, low, lying, orbital, which, can, accept, a, pair, of, electrons, one, notable, example, is, boron, trifluoride, bf, 3, some, other, definitions, of, both, bases, and, acids, have, been, proposed, in, the, past, but, are, not, commonly, used, today, general, properties, of, bases, include, the, following, reaction, represents, the, general, reaction, between, a, base, b, and, water, to, produce, a, conjugate, acid, bh, and, a, conjugate, base, oh, b, aq, h, 2, o, l, bh, aq, oh, aq, displaystyle, ce, b, aq, h2o, l, bh, aq, oh, aq, the, equilibrium, constant, k, b, for, this, reaction, can, be, found, using, the, following, general, equation, in, this, equation, the, base, b, and, the, extremely, strong, base, the, conjugate, base, oh, compete, for, the, proton, as, a, result, bases, that, react, with, water, have, relatively, small, equilibrium, constant, values, the, base, is, weaker, when, it, has, a, lower, equilibrium, constant, value, bases, react, with, acids, to, neutralize, each, other, at, a, fast, rate, both, in, water, and, in, alcohol, when, dissolved, in, water, the, strong, base, sodium, hydroxide, ionizes, into, hydroxide, and, sodium, ions, and, similarly, in, water, the, acid, hydrogen, chloride, forms, hydronium, and, chloride, ions, when, the, two, solutions, are, mixed, the, h, 3, o, and, oh, ions, combine, to, form, water, molecules, if, equal, quantities, of, naoh, and, hcl, are, dissolved, the, base, and, the, acid, neutralize, exactly, leaving, only, nacl, effectively, table, salt, in, solution, weak, bases, such, as, baking, soda, or, egg, white, should, be, used, to, neutralize, any, acid, spills, neutralizing, acid, spills, with, strong, bases, such, as, sodium, hydroxide, or, potassium, hydroxide, can, cause, a, violent, exothermic, reaction, and, the, base, itself, can, cause, just, as, much, damage, as, the, original, acid, spill, bases, are, generally, compounds, that, can, neutralize, an, amount, of, acid, both, sodium, carbonate, and, ammonia, are, bases, although, neither, of, these, substances, contains, oh, groups, both, compounds, accept, h, when, dissolved, in, protic, solvents, such, as, water, from, this, a, ph, or, acidity, can, be, calculated, for, aqueous, solutions, of, bases, a, base, is, also, defined, as, a, molecule, that, has, the, ability, to, accept, an, electron, pair, bond, by, entering, another, atom, s, valence, shell, through, its, possession, of, one, electron, pair, there, are, a, limited, number, of, elements, that, have, atoms, with, the, ability, to, provide, a, molecule, with, basic, properties, carbon, can, act, as, a, base, as, well, as, nitrogen, and, oxygen, fluorine, and, sometimes, rare, gases, possess, this, ability, as, well, this, occurs, typically, in, compounds, such, as, butyl, lithium, alkoxides, and, metal, amides, such, as, sodium, amide, bases, of, carbon, nitrogen, and, oxygen, without, resonance, stabilization, are, usually, very, strong, or, superbases, which, cannot, exist, in, a, water, solution, due, to, the, acidity, of, water, resonance, stabilization, however, enables, weaker, bases, such, as, carboxylates, for, example, sodium, acetate, is, a, weak, base, a, strong, base, is, a, basic, chemical, compound, that, can, remove, a, proton, h, from, or, deprotonate, a, molecule, of, even, a, very, weak, acid, such, as, water, in, an, acid, base, reaction, common, examples, of, strong, bases, include, hydroxides, of, alkali, metals, and, alkaline, earth, metals, like, naoh, and, ca, oh, 2, respectively, due, to, their, low, solubility, some, bases, such, as, alkaline, earth, hydroxides, can, be, used, when, the, solubility, factor, is, not, taken, into, account, one, advantage, of, this, low, solubility, is, that, many, antacids, were, suspensions, of, metal, hydroxides, such, as, aluminium, hydroxide, and, magnesium, hydroxide, compounds, with, low, solubility, and, the, ability, to, stop, an, increase, in, the, concentration, of, the, hydroxide, ion, preventing, the, harm, of, the, tissues, in, the, mouth, oesophagus, and, stomach, as, the, reaction, continues, and, the, salts, dissolve, the, stomach, acid, reacts, with, the, hydroxide, produced, by, the, suspensions, strong, bases, hydrolyze, in, water, almost, completely, resulting, in, the, leveling, effect, in, this, process, the, water, molecule, combines, with, a, strong, base, due, to, the, water, s, amphoteric, ability, and, a, hydroxide, ion, is, released, very, strong, bases, can, even, deprotonate, very, weakly, acidic, c, h, groups, in, the, absence, of, water, here, is, a, list, of, several, strong, bases, the, cations, of, these, strong, bases, appear, in, the, first, and, second, groups, of, the, periodic, table, alkali, and, earth, alkali, metals, tetraalkylated, ammonium, hydroxides, are, also, strong, bases, since, they, dissociate, completely, in, water, guanidine, is, a, special, case, of, a, species, that, is, exceptionally, stable, when, protonated, analogously, to, the, reason, that, makes, perchloric, acid, and, sulfuric, acid, very, strong, acids, acids, with, a, p, k, a, of, more, than, about, 13, are, considered, very, weak, and, their, conjugate, bases, are, strong, bases, group, 1, salts, of, carbanions, amide, ions, and, hydrides, tend, to, be, even, stronger, bases, due, to, the, extreme, weakness, of, their, conjugate, acids, which, are, stable, hydrocarbons, amines, and, dihydrogen, usually, these, bases, are, created, by, adding, pure, alkali, metals, such, as, sodium, into, the, conjugate, acid, they, are, called, superbases, and, it, is, impossible, to, keep, them, in, aqueous, solutions, because, they, are, stronger, bases, than, the, hydroxide, ion, see, the, leveling, effect, for, example, the, ethoxide, ion, conjugate, base, of, ethanol, undergoes, this, reaction, quantitatively, in, presence, of, water, examples, of, common, superbases, are, strongest, superbases, are, synthesised, in, only, gas, phase, a, weak, base, is, one, which, does, not, fully, ionize, in, an, aqueous, solution, or, in, which, protonation, is, incomplete, for, example, ammonia, transfers, a, proton, to, water, according, to, the, equation, the, equilibrium, constant, for, this, reaction, at, 25, c, is, 1, 8, x, 10, 5, such, that, the, extent, of, reaction, or, degree, of, ionization, is, quite, small, a, lewis, base, or, electron, pair, donor, is, a, molecule, with, one, or, more, high, energy, lone, pairs, of, electrons, which, can, be, shared, with, a, low, energy, vacant, orbital, in, an, acceptor, molecule, to, form, an, adduct, in, addition, to, h, possible, electron, pair, acceptors, lewis, acids, include, neutral, molecules, such, as, bf, 3, and, high, oxidation, state, metal, ions, such, as, ag, 2, fe, 3, and, mn, 7, adducts, involving, metal, ions, are, usually, described, as, coordination, complexes, according, to, the, original, formulation, of, lewis, when, a, neutral, base, forms, a, bond, with, a, neutral, acid, a, condition, of, electric, stress, occurs, the, acid, and, the, base, share, the, electron, pair, that, formerly, belonged, to, the, base, as, a, result, a, high, dipole, moment, is, created, which, can, only, be, decreased, to, zero, by, rearranging, the, molecules, examples, of, solid, bases, include, depending, on, a, solid, surface, s, ability, to, successfully, form, a, conjugate, base, by, absorbing, an, electrically, neutral, acid, basic, strength, of, the, surface, is, determined, the, number, of, basic, sites, per, unit, surface, area, of, the, solid, is, used, to, express, how, much, basic, strength, is, found, on, a, solid, base, catalyst, scientists, have, developed, two, methods, to, measure, the, amount, of, basic, sites, one, titration, with, benzoic, acid, using, indicators, and, gaseous, acid, adsorption, a, solid, with, enough, basic, strength, will, absorb, an, electrically, neutral, acidic, indicator, and, cause, the, acidic, indicator, s, color, to, change, to, the, color, of, its, conjugate, base, when, performing, the, gaseous, acid, adsorption, method, nitric, oxide, is, used, the, basic, sites, are, then, determined, by, calculating, the, amount, of, carbon, dioxide, that, is, absorbed, basic, substances, can, be, used, as, insoluble, heterogeneous, catalysts, for, chemical, reactions, some, examples, are, metal, oxides, such, as, magnesium, oxide, calcium, oxide, and, barium, oxide, as, well, as, potassium, fluoride, on, alumina, and, some, zeolites, many, transition, metals, make, good, catalysts, many, of, which, form, basic, substances, basic, catalysts, are, used, for, hydrogenation, the, migration, of, double, bonds, in, the, meerwein, ponndorf, verley, reduction, the, michael, reaction, and, many, others, both, cao, and, bao, can, be, highly, active, catalysts, if, they, are, heated, to, high, temperatures, bases, with, only, one, ionizable, hydroxide, oh, ion, per, formula, unit, are, called, monoprotic, since, they, can, accept, one, proton, h, bases, with, more, than, one, oh, per, formula, unit, are, polyprotic, the, number, of, ionizable, hydroxide, oh, ions, present, in, one, formula, unit, of, a, base, is, also, called, the, acidity, of, the, base, on, the, basis, of, acidity, bases, can, be, classified, into, three, types, monoacidic, diacidic, and, triacidic, when, one, molecule, of, a, base, via, complete, ionization, produces, one, hydroxide, ion, the, base, is, said, to, be, a, monoacidic, or, monoprotic, base, examples, of, monoacidic, bases, are, sodium, hydroxide, potassium, hydroxide, silver, hydroxide, ammonium, hydroxide, etc, when, one, molecule, of, base, via, complete, ionization, produces, two, hydroxide, ions, the, base, is, said, to, be, diacidic, or, diprotic, examples, of, diacidic, bases, are, barium, hydroxide, magnesium, hydroxide, calcium, hydroxide, zinc, hydroxide, iron, ii, hydroxide, tin, ii, hydroxide, lead, ii, hydroxide, copper, ii, hydroxide, etc, when, one, molecule, of, base, via, complete, ionization, produces, three, hydroxide, ions, the, base, is, said, to, be, triacidic, or, triprotic, examples, of, triacidic, bases, are, aluminium, hydroxide, ferrous, hydroxide, gold, trihydroxide, the, concept, of, base, stems, from, an, older, alchemical, notion, of, the, matrix, the, term, base, appears, to, have, been, first, used, in, 1717, by, the, french, chemist, louis, l, mery, as, a, synonym, for, the, older, paracelsian, term, matrix, in, keeping, with, 16th, century, animism, paracelsus, had, postulated, that, naturally, occurring, salts, grew, within, the, earth, as, a, result, of, a, universal, acid, or, seminal, principle, having, impregnated, an, earthy, matrix, or, womb, its, modern, meaning, and, general, introduction, into, the, chemical, vocabulary, however, is, usually, attributed, to, the, french, chemist, guillaume, fran, ois, rouelle, in, 1754, rouelle, explicitly, defined, a, neutral, salt, as, the, product, formed, by, the, union, of, an, acid, with, any, substance, be, it, a, water, soluble, alkali, a, volatile, alkali, an, absorbent, earth, a, metal, or, an, oil, capable, of, serving, as, a, base, for, the, salt, by, giving, it, a, concrete, or, solid, form, most, acids, known, in, the, 18th, century, were, volatile, liquids, or, spirits, capable, of, distillation, whereas, salts, by, their, very, nature, were, crystalline, solids, hence, it, was, the, substance, that, neutralized, the, acid, which, supposedly, destroyed, the, volatility, or, spirit, of, the, acid, and, which, imparted, the, property, of, solidity, i, e, gave, a, concrete, base, to, the, resulting, salt
