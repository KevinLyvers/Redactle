gravitational, waves, are, transient, displacements, in, a, gravitational, field, generated, by, the, motion, or, acceleration, of, gravitating, masses, that, radiate, outward, from, their, source, at, the, speed, of, light, they, were, first, proposed, by, oliver, heaviside, in, 1893, and, then, later, by, henri, poincar, in, 1905, as, the, gravitational, equivalent, of, electromagnetic, waves, in, 1916, albert, einstein, demonstrated, that, gravitational, waves, result, from, his, general, theory, of, relativity, as, ripples, in, spacetime, gravitational, waves, transport, energy, as, gravitational, radiation, a, form, of, radiant, energy, similar, to, electromagnetic, radiation, newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, part, of, classical, mechanics, does, not, provide, for, their, existence, since, that, law, is, predicated, on, the, assumption, that, physical, interactions, propagate, instantaneously, at, infinite, speed, showing, one, of, the, ways, the, methods, of, newtonian, physics, are, unable, to, explain, phenomena, associated, with, relativity, in, gravitational, wave, astronomy, observations, of, gravitational, waves, are, used, to, infer, data, about, the, sources, of, gravitational, waves, sources, that, can, be, studied, this, way, include, binary, star, systems, composed, of, white, dwarfs, neutron, stars, and, black, holes, events, such, as, supernovae, and, the, formation, of, the, early, universe, shortly, after, the, big, bang, the, first, indirect, evidence, for, the, existence, of, gravitational, waves, came, in, 1974, from, the, observed, orbital, decay, of, the, hulse, taylor, binary, pulsar, which, matched, the, decay, predicted, by, general, relativity, as, energy, is, lost, to, gravitational, radiation, in, 1993, russell, a, hulse, and, joseph, hooton, taylor, jr, received, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, this, discovery, the, first, direct, observation, of, gravitational, waves, was, made, in, 2015, when, a, signal, generated, by, the, merger, of, two, black, holes, was, received, by, the, ligo, gravitational, wave, detectors, in, livingston, louisiana, and, in, hanford, washington, the, 2017, nobel, prize, in, physics, was, subsequently, awarded, to, rainer, weiss, kip, thorne, and, barry, barish, for, their, role, in, the, direct, detection, of, gravitational, waves, in, albert, einstein, s, general, theory, of, relativity, gravity, is, treated, as, a, phenomenon, resulting, from, the, curvature, of, spacetime, this, curvature, is, caused, by, the, presence, of, mass, generally, the, more, mass, that, is, contained, within, a, given, volume, of, space, the, greater, the, curvature, of, spacetime, will, be, at, the, boundary, of, its, volume, as, objects, with, mass, move, around, in, spacetime, the, curvature, changes, to, reflect, the, changed, locations, of, those, objects, in, certain, circumstances, accelerating, objects, generate, changes, in, this, curvature, which, propagate, outwards, at, the, speed, of, light, in, a, wave, like, manner, these, propagating, phenomena, are, known, as, gravitational, waves, as, a, gravitational, wave, passes, an, observer, that, observer, will, find, spacetime, distorted, by, the, effects, of, strain, distances, between, objects, increase, and, decrease, rhythmically, as, the, wave, passes, at, a, frequency, equal, to, that, of, the, wave, the, magnitude, of, this, effect, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, distance, from, the, source, 227, inspiraling, binary, neutron, stars, are, predicted, to, be, a, powerful, source, of, gravitational, waves, as, they, coalesce, due, to, the, very, large, acceleration, of, their, masses, as, they, orbit, close, to, one, another, however, due, to, the, astronomical, distances, to, these, sources, the, effects, when, measured, on, earth, are, predicted, to, be, very, small, having, strains, of, less, than, 1, part, in, 10, 20, scientists, demonstrate, the, existence, of, these, waves, with, highly, sensitive, detectors, at, multiple, observation, sites, as, of, 2012, the, ligo, and, virgo, observatories, were, the, most, sensitive, detectors, operating, at, resolutions, of, about, one, part, in, 5, 10, 22, the, japanese, detector, kagra, was, completed, in, 2019, its, first, joint, detection, with, ligo, and, virgo, was, reported, in, 2021, another, european, ground, based, detector, the, einstein, telescope, is, under, development, a, space, based, observatory, the, laser, interferometer, space, antenna, is, also, being, developed, by, the, european, space, agency, gravitational, waves, do, not, strongly, interact, with, matter, in, the, way, that, electromagnetic, radiation, does, 33, 34, this, allows, for, the, observation, of, events, involving, exotic, objects, in, the, distant, universe, that, cannot, be, observed, with, more, traditional, means, such, as, optical, telescopes, or, radio, telescopes, accordingly, gravitational, wave, astronomy, gives, new, insights, into, the, workings, of, the, universe, 36, 40, in, particular, gravitational, waves, could, be, of, interest, to, cosmologists, as, they, offer, a, possible, way, of, observing, the, very, early, universe, this, is, not, possible, with, conventional, astronomy, since, before, recombination, the, universe, was, opaque, to, electromagnetic, radiation, precise, measurements, of, gravitational, waves, will, also, allow, scientists, to, test, more, thoroughly, the, general, theory, of, relativity, in, principle, gravitational, waves, can, exist, at, any, frequency, very, low, frequency, waves, are, detected, using, pulsar, timing, arrays, astronomers, monitor, the, timing, of, approximately, 100, pulsars, spread, widely, across, our, galaxy, over, the, course, of, years, detectable, changes, in, the, arrival, time, of, their, signals, can, result, from, passing, gravitational, waves, generated, by, merging, supermassive, black, holes, with, wavelengths, measured, in, lightyears, these, timing, changes, can, be, used, to, locate, the, source, of, the, waves, using, this, technique, astronomers, have, discovered, the, hum, of, various, smbh, mergers, occurring, in, the, universe, stephen, hawking, and, werner, israel, list, different, frequency, bands, for, gravitational, waves, that, could, plausibly, be, detected, ranging, from, 10, 7, hz, up, to, 10, 11, hz, the, speed, of, gravitational, waves, in, the, general, theory, of, relativity, is, equal, to, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, c, within, the, theory, of, special, relativity, the, constant, c, is, not, only, about, light, instead, it, is, the, highest, possible, speed, for, any, interaction, in, nature, formally, c, is, a, conversion, factor, for, changing, the, unit, of, time, to, the, unit, of, space, this, makes, it, the, only, speed, which, does, not, depend, either, on, the, motion, of, an, observer, or, a, source, of, light, and, or, gravity, thus, the, speed, of, light, is, also, the, speed, of, gravitational, waves, and, further, the, speed, of, any, massless, particle, such, particles, include, the, gluon, carrier, of, the, strong, force, the, photons, that, make, up, light, hence, carrier, of, electromagnetic, force, and, the, hypothetical, gravitons, which, are, the, presumptive, field, particles, associated, with, gravity, however, an, understanding, of, the, graviton, if, any, exist, requires, an, as, yet, unavailable, theory, of, quantum, gravity, in, august, 2017, the, ligo, and, virgo, detectors, received, gravitational, wave, signals, within, 2, seconds, of, gamma, ray, satellites, and, optical, telescopes, seeing, signals, from, the, same, direction, this, confirmed, that, the, speed, of, gravitational, waves, was, the, same, as, the, speed, of, light, the, possibility, of, gravitational, waves, and, that, those, might, travel, at, the, speed, of, light, was, discussed, in, 1893, by, oliver, heaviside, using, the, analogy, between, the, inverse, square, law, of, gravitation, and, the, electrostatic, force, in, 1905, henri, poincar, proposed, gravitational, waves, emanating, from, a, body, and, propagating, at, the, speed, of, light, as, being, required, by, the, lorentz, transformations, and, suggested, that, in, analogy, to, an, accelerating, electrical, charge, producing, electromagnetic, waves, accelerated, masses, in, a, relativistic, field, theory, of, gravity, should, produce, gravitational, waves, in, 1915, einstein, published, his, general, theory, of, relativity, a, complete, relativistic, theory, of, gravitation, he, conjectured, like, poincare, that, the, equation, would, produce, gravitational, waves, but, as, he, mentions, in, a, letter, to, schwarzschild, in, february, 1916, these, could, not, be, similar, to, electromagnetic, waves, electromagnetic, waves, can, be, produced, by, dipole, motion, requiring, both, a, positive, and, a, negative, charge, gravitation, has, no, equivalent, to, negative, charge, einstein, continued, to, work, through, the, complexity, of, the, equations, of, general, relativity, to, find, an, alternative, wave, model, the, result, was, published, in, june, 1916, and, there, he, came, to, the, conclusion, that, the, gravitational, wave, must, propagate, with, the, speed, of, light, and, there, must, in, fact, be, three, types, of, gravitational, waves, dubbed, longitudinal, longitudinal, transverse, longitudinal, and, transverse, transverse, by, hermann, weyl, however, the, nature, of, einstein, s, approximations, led, many, including, einstein, himself, to, doubt, the, result, in, 1922, arthur, eddington, showed, that, two, of, einstein, s, types, of, waves, were, artifacts, of, the, coordinate, system, he, used, and, could, be, made, to, propagate, at, any, speed, by, choosing, appropriate, coordinates, leading, eddington, to, jest, that, they, propagate, at, the, speed, of, thought, 72, this, also, cast, doubt, on, the, physicality, of, the, third, transverse, transverse, type, that, eddington, showed, always, propagate, at, the, speed, of, light, regardless, of, coordinate, system, in, 1936, einstein, and, nathan, rosen, submitted, a, paper, to, physical, review, in, which, they, claimed, gravitational, waves, could, not, exist, in, the, full, general, theory, of, relativity, because, any, such, solution, of, the, field, equations, would, have, a, singularity, the, journal, sent, their, manuscript, to, be, reviewed, by, howard, p, robertson, who, anonymously, reported, that, the, singularities, in, question, were, simply, the, harmless, coordinate, singularities, of, the, employed, cylindrical, coordinates, einstein, who, was, unfamiliar, with, the, concept, of, peer, review, angrily, withdrew, the, manuscript, never, to, publish, in, physical, review, again, nonetheless, his, assistant, leopold, infeld, who, had, been, in, contact, with, robertson, convinced, einstein, that, the, criticism, was, correct, and, the, paper, was, rewritten, with, the, opposite, conclusion, and, published, elsewhere, 79ff, in, 1956, felix, pirani, remedied, the, confusion, caused, by, the, use, of, various, coordinate, systems, by, rephrasing, the, gravitational, waves, in, terms, of, the, manifestly, observable, riemann, curvature, tensor, at, the, time, pirani, s, work, was, overshadowed, by, the, community, s, focus, on, a, different, question, whether, gravitational, waves, could, transmit, energy, this, matter, was, settled, by, a, thought, experiment, proposed, by, richard, feynman, during, the, first, gr, conference, at, chapel, hill, in, 1957, in, short, his, argument, known, as, the, sticky, bead, argument, notes, that, if, one, takes, a, rod, with, beads, then, the, effect, of, a, passing, gravitational, wave, would, be, to, move, the, beads, along, the, rod, friction, would, then, produce, heat, implying, that, the, passing, wave, had, done, work, shortly, after, hermann, bondi, published, a, detailed, version, of, the, sticky, bead, argument, this, later, led, to, a, series, of, articles, 1959, to, 1989, by, bondi, and, pirani, that, established, the, existence, of, plane, wave, solutions, for, gravitational, waves, paul, dirac, further, postulated, the, existence, of, gravitational, waves, declaring, them, to, have, physical, significance, in, his, 1959, lecture, at, the, lindau, meetings, further, it, was, dirac, who, predicted, gravitational, waves, with, a, well, defined, energy, density, in, 1964, after, the, chapel, hill, conference, joseph, weber, started, designing, and, building, the, first, gravitational, wave, detectors, now, known, as, weber, bars, in, 1969, weber, claimed, to, have, detected, the, first, gravitational, waves, and, by, 1970, he, was, detecting, signals, regularly, from, the, galactic, center, however, the, frequency, of, detection, soon, raised, doubts, on, the, validity, of, his, observations, as, the, implied, rate, of, energy, loss, of, the, milky, way, would, drain, our, galaxy, of, energy, on, a, timescale, much, shorter, than, its, inferred, age, these, doubts, were, strengthened, when, by, the, mid, 1970s, repeated, experiments, from, other, groups, building, their, own, weber, bars, across, the, globe, failed, to, find, any, signals, and, by, the, late, 1970s, consensus, was, that, weber, s, results, were, spurious, in, the, same, period, the, first, indirect, evidence, of, gravitational, waves, was, discovered, in, 1974, russell, alan, hulse, and, joseph, hooton, taylor, jr, discovered, the, first, binary, pulsar, which, earned, them, the, 1993, nobel, prize, in, physics, pulsar, timing, observations, over, the, next, decade, showed, a, gradual, decay, of, the, orbital, period, of, the, hulse, taylor, pulsar, that, matched, the, loss, of, energy, and, angular, momentum, in, gravitational, radiation, predicted, by, general, relativity, this, indirect, detection, of, gravitational, waves, motivated, further, searches, despite, weber, s, discredited, result, some, groups, continued, to, improve, weber, s, original, concept, while, others, pursued, the, detection, of, gravitational, waves, using, laser, interferometers, the, idea, of, using, a, laser, interferometer, for, this, seems, to, have, been, floated, independently, by, various, people, including, m, e, gertsenshtein, and, v, i, pustovoit, in, 1962, and, vladimir, b, braginski, in, 1966, the, first, prototypes, were, developed, in, the, 1970s, by, robert, l, forward, and, rainer, weiss, in, the, decades, that, followed, ever, more, sensitive, instruments, were, constructed, culminating, in, the, construction, of, geo600, ligo, and, virgo, after, years, of, producing, null, results, improved, detectors, became, operational, in, 2015, on, 11, february, 2016, the, ligo, virgo, collaborations, announced, the, first, observation, of, gravitational, waves, from, a, signal, dubbed, gw150914, detected, at, 09, 50, 45, gmt, on, 14, september, 2015, of, two, black, holes, with, masses, of, 29, and, 36, solar, masses, merging, about, 1, 3, billion, light, years, away, during, the, final, fraction, of, a, second, of, the, merger, it, released, more, than, 50, times, the, power, of, all, the, stars, in, the, observable, universe, combined, the, signal, increased, in, frequency, from, 35, to, 250, hz, over, 10, cycles, 5, orbits, as, it, rose, in, strength, for, a, period, of, 0, 2, second, the, mass, of, the, new, merged, black, hole, was, 62, solar, masses, energy, equivalent, to, three, solar, masses, was, emitted, as, gravitational, waves, the, signal, was, seen, by, both, ligo, detectors, in, livingston, and, hanford, with, a, time, difference, of, 7, milliseconds, due, to, the, angle, between, the, two, detectors, and, the, source, the, signal, came, from, the, southern, celestial, hemisphere, in, the, rough, direction, of, but, much, farther, away, than, the, magellanic, clouds, the, confidence, level, of, this, being, an, observation, of, gravitational, waves, was, 99, 99994, a, year, earlier, the, bicep2, collaboration, claimed, that, they, had, detected, the, imprint, of, gravitational, waves, in, the, cosmic, microwave, background, however, they, were, later, forced, to, retract, this, result, in, 2017, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, was, awarded, to, rainer, weiss, kip, thorne, and, barry, barish, for, their, role, in, the, detection, of, gravitational, waves, in, 2023, nanograv, epta, ppta, and, ipta, announced, that, they, found, evidence, of, a, universal, gravitational, wave, background, north, american, nanohertz, observatory, for, gravitational, waves, states, that, they, were, created, over, cosmological, time, scales, by, supermassive, black, holes, identifying, the, distinctive, hellings, downs, curve, in, 15, years, of, radio, observations, of, 25, pulsars, similar, results, are, published, by, european, pulsar, timing, array, who, claimed, a, 3, displaystyle, 3, sigma, significance, they, expect, that, a, 5, displaystyle, 5, sigma, significance, will, be, achieved, by, 2025, by, combining, the, measurements, of, several, collaborations, gravitational, waves, are, constantly, passing, earth, however, even, the, strongest, have, a, minuscule, effect, and, their, sources, are, generally, at, a, great, distance, for, example, the, waves, given, off, by, the, cataclysmic, final, merger, of, gw150914, reached, earth, after, travelling, over, a, billion, light, years, as, a, ripple, in, spacetime, that, changed, the, length, of, a, 4, km, ligo, arm, by, a, thousandth, of, the, width, of, a, proton, proportionally, equivalent, to, changing, the, distance, to, the, nearest, star, outside, the, solar, system, by, one, hair, s, width, this, tiny, effect, from, even, extreme, gravitational, waves, makes, them, observable, on, earth, only, with, the, most, sophisticated, detectors, the, effects, of, a, passing, gravitational, wave, in, an, extremely, exaggerated, form, can, be, visualized, by, imagining, a, perfectly, flat, region, of, spacetime, with, a, group, of, motionless, test, particles, lying, in, a, plane, e, g, the, surface, of, a, computer, screen, as, a, gravitational, wave, passes, through, the, particles, along, a, line, perpendicular, to, the, plane, of, the, particles, i, e, following, the, observer, s, line, of, vision, into, the, screen, the, particles, will, follow, the, distortion, in, spacetime, oscillating, in, a, cruciform, manner, as, shown, in, the, animations, the, area, enclosed, by, the, test, particles, does, not, change, and, there, is, no, motion, along, the, direction, of, propagation, the, oscillations, depicted, in, the, animation, are, exaggerated, for, the, purpose, of, discussion, in, reality, a, gravitational, wave, has, a, very, small, amplitude, as, formulated, in, linearized, gravity, however, they, help, illustrate, the, kind, of, oscillations, associated, with, gravitational, waves, as, produced, by, a, pair, of, masses, in, a, circular, orbit, in, this, case, the, amplitude, of, the, gravitational, wave, is, constant, but, its, plane, of, polarization, changes, or, rotates, at, twice, the, orbital, rate, so, the, time, varying, gravitational, wave, size, or, periodic, spacetime, strain, exhibits, a, variation, as, shown, in, the, animation, if, the, orbit, of, the, masses, is, elliptical, then, the, gravitational, wave, s, amplitude, also, varies, with, time, according, to, einstein, s, quadrupole, formula, as, with, other, waves, there, are, a, number, of, characteristics, used, to, describe, a, gravitational, wave, the, speed, wavelength, and, frequency, of, a, gravitational, wave, are, related, by, the, equation, c, f, just, like, the, equation, for, a, light, wave, for, example, the, animations, shown, here, oscillate, roughly, once, every, two, seconds, this, would, correspond, to, a, frequency, of, 0, 5, hz, and, a, wavelength, of, about, 600, 000, km, or, 47, times, the, diameter, of, the, earth, in, the, above, example, it, is, assumed, that, the, wave, is, linearly, polarized, with, a, plus, polarization, written, h, polarization, of, a, gravitational, wave, is, just, like, polarization, of, a, light, wave, except, that, the, polarizations, of, a, gravitational, wave, are, 45, degrees, apart, as, opposed, to, 90, degrees, in, particular, in, a, cross, polarized, gravitational, wave, h, the, effect, on, the, test, particles, would, be, basically, the, same, but, rotated, by, 45, degrees, as, shown, in, the, second, animation, just, as, with, light, polarization, the, polarizations, of, gravitational, waves, may, also, be, expressed, in, terms, of, circularly, polarized, waves, gravitational, waves, are, polarized, because, of, the, nature, of, their, source, in, general, terms, gravitational, waves, are, radiated, by, objects, whose, motion, involves, acceleration, and, its, change, provided, that, the, motion, is, not, perfectly, spherically, symmetric, like, an, expanding, or, contracting, sphere, or, rotationally, symmetric, like, a, spinning, disk, or, sphere, a, simple, example, of, this, principle, is, a, spinning, dumbbell, if, the, dumbbell, spins, around, its, axis, of, symmetry, it, will, not, radiate, gravitational, waves, if, it, tumbles, end, over, end, as, in, the, case, of, two, planets, orbiting, each, other, it, will, radiate, gravitational, waves, the, heavier, the, dumbbell, and, the, faster, it, tumbles, the, greater, is, the, gravitational, radiation, it, will, give, off, in, an, extreme, case, such, as, when, the, two, weights, of, the, dumbbell, are, massive, stars, like, neutron, stars, or, black, holes, orbiting, each, other, quickly, then, significant, amounts, of, gravitational, radiation, would, be, given, off, some, more, detailed, examples, more, technically, the, second, time, derivative, of, the, quadrupole, moment, or, the, l, th, time, derivative, of, the, l, th, multipole, moment, of, an, isolated, system, s, stress, energy, tensor, must, be, non, zero, in, order, for, it, to, emit, gravitational, radiation, this, is, analogous, to, the, changing, dipole, moment, of, charge, or, current, that, is, necessary, for, the, emission, of, electromagnetic, radiation, gravitational, waves, carry, energy, away, from, their, sources, and, in, the, case, of, orbiting, bodies, this, is, associated, with, an, in, spiral, or, decrease, in, orbit, imagine, for, example, a, simple, system, of, two, masses, such, as, the, earth, sun, system, moving, slowly, compared, to, the, speed, of, light, in, circular, orbits, assume, that, these, two, masses, orbit, each, other, in, a, circular, orbit, in, the, x, y, plane, to, a, good, approximation, the, masses, follow, simple, keplerian, orbits, however, such, an, orbit, represents, a, changing, quadrupole, moment, that, is, the, system, will, give, off, gravitational, waves, in, theory, the, loss, of, energy, through, gravitational, radiation, could, eventually, drop, the, earth, into, the, sun, however, the, total, energy, of, the, earth, orbiting, the, sun, kinetic, energy, gravitational, potential, energy, is, about, 1, 14, 10, 36, joules, of, which, only, 200, watts, joules, per, second, is, lost, through, gravitational, radiation, leading, to, a, decay, in, the, orbit, by, about, 1, 10, 15, meters, per, day, or, roughly, the, diameter, of, a, proton, at, this, rate, it, would, take, the, earth, approximately, 3, 10, 13, times, more, than, the, current, age, of, the, universe, to, spiral, onto, the, sun, this, estimate, overlooks, the, decrease, in, r, over, time, but, the, radius, varies, only, slowly, for, most, of, the, time, and, plunges, at, later, stages, as, r, t, r, 0, 1, t, t, coalesce, 1, 4, displaystyle, r, t, r, 0, left, 1, frac, t, t, text, coalesce, right, 1, 4, with, r, 0, displaystyle, r, 0, the, initial, radius, and, t, coalesce, displaystyle, t, text, coalesce, the, total, time, needed, to, fully, coalesce, more, generally, the, rate, of, orbital, decay, can, be, approximated, by, where, r, is, the, separation, between, the, bodies, t, time, g, the, gravitational, constant, c, the, speed, of, light, and, m, 1, and, m, 2, the, masses, of, the, bodies, this, leads, to, an, expected, time, to, merger, of, compact, stars, like, white, dwarfs, and, neutron, stars, can, be, constituents, of, binaries, for, example, a, pair, of, solar, mass, neutron, stars, in, a, circular, orbit, at, a, separation, of, 1, 89, 10, 8, m, 189, 000, km, has, an, orbital, period, of, 1, 000, seconds, and, an, expected, lifetime, of, 1, 30, 10, 13, seconds, or, about, 414, 000, years, such, a, system, could, be, observed, by, lisa, if, it, were, not, too, far, away, a, far, greater, number, of, white, dwarf, binaries, exist, with, orbital, periods, in, this, range, white, dwarf, binaries, have, masses, in, the, order, of, the, sun, and, diameters, in, the, order, of, the, earth, they, cannot, get, much, closer, together, than, 10, 000, km, before, they, will, merge, and, explode, in, a, supernova, which, would, also, end, the, emission, of, gravitational, waves, until, then, their, gravitational, radiation, would, be, comparable, to, that, of, a, neutron, star, binary, when, the, orbit, of, a, neutron, star, binary, has, decayed, to, 1, 89, 10, 6, m, 1890, km, its, remaining, lifetime, is, about, 130, 000, seconds, or, 36, hours, the, orbital, frequency, will, vary, from, 1, orbit, per, second, at, the, start, to, 918, orbits, per, second, when, the, orbit, has, shrunk, to, 20, km, at, merger, the, majority, of, gravitational, radiation, emitted, will, be, at, twice, the, orbital, frequency, just, before, merger, the, inspiral, could, be, observed, by, ligo, if, such, a, binary, were, close, enough, ligo, has, only, a, few, minutes, to, observe, this, merger, out, of, a, total, orbital, lifetime, that, may, have, been, billions, of, years, in, august, 2017, ligo, and, virgo, observed, the, first, binary, neutron, star, inspiral, in, gw170817, and, 70, observatories, collaborated, to, detect, the, electromagnetic, counterpart, a, kilonova, in, the, galaxy, ngc, 4993, 40, megaparsecs, away, emitting, a, short, gamma, ray, burst, grb, 170817a, seconds, after, the, merger, followed, by, a, longer, optical, transient, at, 2017gfo, powered, by, r, process, nuclei, advanced, ligo, detectors, should, be, able, to, detect, such, events, up, to, 200, megaparsecs, away, within, this, range, of, the, order, 40, events, are, expected, per, year, black, hole, binaries, emit, gravitational, waves, during, their, in, spiral, merger, and, ring, down, phases, hence, in, the, early, 1990s, the, physics, community, rallied, around, a, concerted, effort, to, predict, the, waveforms, of, gravitational, waves, from, these, systems, with, the, binary, black, hole, grand, challenge, alliance, the, largest, amplitude, of, emission, occurs, during, the, merger, phase, which, can, be, modeled, with, the, techniques, of, numerical, relativity, the, first, direct, detection, of, gravitational, waves, gw150914, came, from, the, merger, of, two, black, holes, a, supernova, is, a, transient, astronomical, event, that, occurs, during, the, last, stellar, evolutionary, stages, of, a, massive, star, s, life, whose, dramatic, and, catastrophic, destruction, is, marked, by, one, final, titanic, explosion, this, explosion, can, happen, in, one, of, many, ways, but, in, all, of, them, a, significant, proportion, of, the, matter, in, the, star, is, blown, away, into, the, surrounding, space, at, extremely, high, velocities, up, to, 10, of, the, speed, of, light, unless, there, is, perfect, spherical, symmetry, in, these, explosions, i, e, unless, matter, is, spewed, out, evenly, in, all, directions, there, will, be, gravitational, radiation, from, the, explosion, this, is, because, gravitational, waves, are, generated, by, a, changing, quadrupole, moment, which, can, happen, only, when, there, is, asymmetrical, movement, of, masses, since, the, exact, mechanism, by, which, supernovae, take, place, is, not, fully, understood, it, is, not, easy, to, model, the, gravitational, radiation, emitted, by, them, as, noted, above, a, mass, distribution, will, emit, gravitational, radiation, only, when, there, is, spherically, asymmetric, motion, among, the, masses, a, spinning, neutron, star, will, generally, emit, no, gravitational, radiation, because, neutron, stars, are, highly, dense, objects, with, a, strong, gravitational, field, that, keeps, them, almost, perfectly, spherical, in, some, cases, however, there, might, be, slight, deformities, on, the, surface, called, mountains, which, are, bumps, extending, no, more, than, 10, centimeters, 4, inches, above, the, surface, that, make, the, spinning, spherically, asymmetric, this, gives, the, star, a, quadrupole, moment, that, changes, with, time, and, it, will, emit, gravitational, waves, until, the, deformities, are, smoothed, out, many, models, of, the, universe, suggest, that, there, was, an, inflationary, epoch, in, the, early, history, of, the, universe, when, space, expanded, by, a, large, factor, in, a, very, short, amount, of, time, if, this, expansion, was, not, symmetric, in, all, directions, it, may, have, emitted, gravitational, radiation, detectable, today, as, a, gravitational, wave, background, this, background, signal, is, too, weak, for, any, currently, operational, gravitational, wave, detector, to, observe, and, it, is, thought, it, may, be, decades, before, such, an, observation, can, be, made, water, waves, sound, waves, and, electromagnetic, waves, are, able, to, carry, energy, momentum, and, angular, momentum, and, by, doing, so, they, carry, those, away, from, the, source, gravitational, waves, perform, the, same, function, thus, for, example, a, binary, system, loses, angular, momentum, as, the, two, orbiting, objects, spiral, towards, each, other, the, angular, momentum, is, radiated, away, by, gravitational, waves, the, waves, can, also, carry, off, linear, momentum, a, possibility, that, has, some, interesting, implications, for, astrophysics, after, two, supermassive, black, holes, coalesce, emission, of, linear, momentum, can, produce, a, kick, with, amplitude, as, large, as, 4000, km, s, this, is, fast, enough, to, eject, the, coalesced, black, hole, completely, from, its, host, galaxy, even, if, the, kick, is, too, small, to, eject, the, black, hole, completely, it, can, remove, it, temporarily, from, the, nucleus, of, the, galaxy, after, which, it, will, oscillate, about, the, center, eventually, coming, to, rest, a, kicked, black, hole, can, also, carry, a, star, cluster, with, it, forming, a, hyper, compact, stellar, system, or, it, may, carry, gas, allowing, the, recoiling, black, hole, to, appear, temporarily, as, a, naked, quasar, the, quasar, sdss, j092712, 65, 294344, 0, is, thought, to, contain, a, recoiling, supermassive, black, hole, like, electromagnetic, waves, gravitational, waves, should, exhibit, shifting, of, wavelength, and, frequency, due, to, the, relative, velocities, of, the, source, and, observer, the, doppler, effect, but, also, due, to, distortions, of, spacetime, such, as, cosmic, expansion, redshifting, of, gravitational, waves, is, different, from, redshifting, due, to, gravity, gravitational, redshift, in, the, framework, of, quantum, field, theory, the, graviton, is, the, name, given, to, a, hypothetical, elementary, particle, speculated, to, be, the, force, carrier, that, mediates, gravity, however, the, graviton, is, not, yet, proven, to, exist, and, no, scientific, model, yet, exists, that, successfully, reconciles, general, relativity, which, describes, gravity, and, the, standard, model, which, describes, all, other, fundamental, forces, attempts, such, as, quantum, gravity, have, been, made, but, are, not, yet, accepted, if, such, a, particle, exists, it, is, expected, to, be, massless, because, the, gravitational, force, appears, to, have, unlimited, range, and, must, be, a, spin, 2, boson, it, can, be, shown, that, any, massless, spin, 2, field, would, give, rise, to, a, force, indistinguishable, from, gravitation, because, a, massless, spin, 2, field, must, couple, to, interact, with, the, stress, energy, tensor, in, the, same, way, that, the, gravitational, field, does, therefore, if, a, massless, spin, 2, particle, were, ever, discovered, it, would, be, likely, to, be, the, graviton, without, further, distinction, from, other, massless, spin, 2, particles, such, a, discovery, would, unite, quantum, theory, with, gravity, due, to, the, weakness, of, the, coupling, of, gravity, to, matter, gravitational, waves, experience, very, little, absorption, or, scattering, even, as, they, travel, over, astronomical, distances, in, particular, gravitational, waves, are, expected, to, be, unaffected, by, the, opacity, of, the, very, early, universe, in, these, early, phases, space, had, not, yet, become, transparent, so, observations, based, upon, light, radio, waves, and, other, electromagnetic, radiation, that, far, back, into, time, are, limited, or, unavailable, therefore, gravitational, waves, are, expected, in, principle, to, have, the, potential, to, provide, a, wealth, of, observational, data, about, the, very, early, universe, the, difficulty, in, directly, detecting, gravitational, waves, means, it, is, also, difficult, for, a, single, detector, to, identify, by, itself, the, direction, of, a, source, therefore, multiple, detectors, are, used, both, to, distinguish, signals, from, other, noise, by, confirming, the, signal, is, not, of, earthly, origin, and, also, to, determine, direction, by, means, of, triangulation, this, technique, uses, the, fact, that, the, waves, travel, at, the, speed, of, light, and, will, reach, different, detectors, at, different, times, depending, on, their, source, direction, although, the, differences, in, arrival, time, may, be, just, a, few, milliseconds, this, is, sufficient, to, identify, the, direction, of, the, origin, of, the, wave, with, considerable, precision, only, in, the, case, of, gw170814, were, three, detectors, operating, at, the, time, of, the, event, therefore, the, direction, is, precisely, defined, the, detection, by, all, three, instruments, led, to, a, very, accurate, estimate, of, the, position, of, the, source, with, a, 90, credible, region, of, just, 60, deg, 2, a, factor, 20, more, accurate, than, before, during, the, past, century, astronomy, has, been, revolutionized, by, the, use, of, new, methods, for, observing, the, universe, astronomical, observations, were, initially, made, using, visible, light, galileo, galilei, pioneered, the, use, of, telescopes, to, enhance, these, observations, however, visible, light, is, only, a, small, portion, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, and, not, all, objects, in, the, distant, universe, shine, strongly, in, this, particular, band, more, information, may, be, found, for, example, in, radio, wavelengths, using, radio, telescopes, astronomers, have, discovered, pulsars, and, quasars, for, example, observations, in, the, microwave, band, led, to, the, detection, of, faint, imprints, of, the, big, bang, a, discovery, stephen, hawking, called, the, greatest, discovery, of, the, century, if, not, all, time, similar, advances, in, observations, using, gamma, rays, x, rays, ultraviolet, light, and, infrared, light, have, also, brought, new, insights, to, astronomy, as, each, of, these, regions, of, the, spectrum, has, opened, new, discoveries, have, been, made, that, could, not, have, been, made, otherwise, the, astronomy, community, hopes, that, the, same, holds, true, of, gravitational, waves, gravitational, waves, have, two, important, and, unique, properties, first, there, is, no, need, for, any, type, of, matter, to, be, present, nearby, in, order, for, the, waves, to, be, generated, by, a, binary, system, of, uncharged, black, holes, which, would, emit, no, electromagnetic, radiation, second, gravitational, waves, can, pass, through, any, intervening, matter, without, being, scattered, significantly, whereas, light, from, distant, stars, may, be, blocked, out, by, interstellar, dust, for, example, gravitational, waves, will, pass, through, essentially, unimpeded, these, two, features, allow, gravitational, waves, to, carry, information, about, astronomical, phenomena, heretofore, never, observed, by, humans, the, sources, of, gravitational, waves, described, above, are, in, the, low, frequency, end, of, the, gravitational, wave, spectrum, 10, 7, to, 10, 5, hz, an, astrophysical, source, at, the, high, frequency, end, of, the, gravitational, wave, spectrum, above, 10, 5, hz, and, probably, 10, 10, hz, generates, relic, gravitational, waves, that, are, theorized, to, be, faint, imprints, of, the, big, bang, like, the, cosmic, microwave, background, at, these, high, frequencies, it, is, potentially, possible, that, the, sources, may, be, man, made, that, is, gravitational, waves, generated, and, detected, in, the, laboratory, a, supermassive, black, hole, created, from, the, merger, of, the, black, holes, at, the, center, of, two, merging, galaxies, detected, by, the, hubble, space, telescope, is, theorized, to, have, been, ejected, from, the, merger, center, by, gravitational, waves, although, the, waves, from, the, earth, sun, system, are, minuscule, astronomers, can, point, to, other, sources, for, which, the, radiation, should, be, substantial, one, important, example, is, the, hulse, taylor, binary, a, pair, of, stars, one, of, which, is, a, pulsar, the, characteristics, of, their, orbit, can, be, deduced, from, the, doppler, shifting, of, radio, signals, given, off, by, the, pulsar, each, of, the, stars, is, about, 1, 4, m, and, the, size, of, their, orbits, is, about, 1, 75, of, the, earth, sun, orbit, just, a, few, times, larger, than, the, diameter, of, our, own, sun, the, combination, of, greater, masses, and, smaller, separation, means, that, the, energy, given, off, by, the, hulse, taylor, binary, will, be, far, greater, than, the, energy, given, off, by, the, earth, sun, system, roughly, 10, 22, times, as, much, the, information, about, the, orbit, can, be, used, to, predict, how, much, energy, and, angular, momentum, would, be, radiated, in, the, form, of, gravitational, waves, as, the, binary, system, loses, energy, the, stars, gradually, draw, closer, to, each, other, and, the, orbital, period, decreases, the, resulting, trajectory, of, each, star, is, an, inspiral, a, spiral, with, decreasing, radius, general, relativity, precisely, describes, these, trajectories, in, particular, the, energy, radiated, in, gravitational, waves, determines, the, rate, of, decrease, in, the, period, defined, as, the, time, interval, between, successive, periastrons, points, of, closest, approach, of, the, two, stars, for, the, hulse, taylor, pulsar, the, predicted, current, change, in, radius, is, about, 3, mm, per, orbit, and, the, change, in, the, 7, 75, hr, period, is, about, 2, seconds, per, year, following, a, preliminary, observation, showing, an, orbital, energy, loss, consistent, with, gravitational, waves, careful, timing, observations, by, taylor, and, joel, weisberg, dramatically, confirmed, the, predicted, period, decrease, to, within, 10, with, the, improved, statistics, of, more, than, 30, years, of, timing, data, since, the, pulsar, s, discovery, the, observed, change, in, the, orbital, period, currently, matches, the, prediction, from, gravitational, radiation, assumed, by, general, relativity, to, within, 0, 2, percent, in, 1993, spurred, in, part, by, this, indirect, detection, of, gravitational, waves, the, nobel, committee, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, to, hulse, and, taylor, for, the, discovery, of, a, new, type, of, pulsar, a, discovery, that, has, opened, up, new, possibilities, for, the, study, of, gravitation, the, lifetime, of, this, binary, system, from, the, present, to, merger, is, estimated, to, be, a, few, hundred, million, years, inspirals, are, very, important, sources, of, gravitational, waves, any, time, two, compact, objects, white, dwarfs, neutron, stars, or, black, holes, are, in, close, orbits, they, send, out, intense, gravitational, waves, as, they, spiral, closer, to, each, other, these, waves, become, more, intense, at, some, point, they, should, become, so, intense, that, direct, detection, by, their, effect, on, objects, on, earth, or, in, space, is, possible, this, direct, detection, is, the, goal, of, several, large, scale, experiments, the, only, difficulty, is, that, most, systems, like, the, hulse, taylor, binary, are, so, far, away, the, amplitude, of, waves, given, off, by, the, hulse, taylor, binary, at, earth, would, be, roughly, h, 10, 26, there, are, some, sources, however, that, astrophysicists, expect, to, find, that, produce, much, greater, amplitudes, of, h, 10, 20, at, least, eight, other, binary, pulsars, have, been, discovered, gravitational, waves, are, not, easily, detectable, when, they, reach, the, earth, they, have, a, small, amplitude, with, strain, approximately, 10, 21, meaning, that, an, extremely, sensitive, detector, is, needed, and, that, other, sources, of, noise, can, overwhelm, the, signal, gravitational, waves, are, expected, to, have, frequencies, 10, 16, hz, f, 10, 4, hz, though, the, hulse, taylor, observations, were, very, important, they, give, only, indirect, evidence, for, gravitational, waves, a, more, conclusive, observation, would, be, a, direct, measurement, of, the, effect, of, a, passing, gravitational, wave, which, could, also, provide, more, information, about, the, system, that, generated, it, any, such, direct, detection, is, complicated, by, the, extraordinarily, small, effect, the, waves, would, produce, on, a, detector, the, amplitude, of, a, spherical, wave, will, fall, off, as, the, inverse, of, the, distance, from, the, source, the, 1, r, term, in, the, formulas, for, h, above, thus, even, waves, from, extreme, systems, like, merging, binary, black, holes, die, out, to, very, small, amplitudes, by, the, time, they, reach, the, earth, astrophysicists, expect, that, some, gravitational, waves, passing, the, earth, may, be, as, large, as, h, 10, 20, but, generally, no, bigger, a, simple, device, theorised, to, detect, the, expected, wave, motion, is, called, a, weber, bar, a, large, solid, bar, of, metal, isolated, from, outside, vibrations, this, type, of, instrument, was, the, first, type, of, gravitational, wave, detector, strains, in, space, due, to, an, incident, gravitational, wave, excite, the, bar, s, resonant, frequency, and, could, thus, be, amplified, to, detectable, levels, conceivably, a, nearby, supernova, might, be, strong, enough, to, be, seen, without, resonant, amplification, with, this, instrument, joseph, weber, claimed, to, have, detected, daily, signals, of, gravitational, waves, his, results, however, were, contested, in, 1974, by, physicists, richard, garwin, and, david, douglass, modern, forms, of, the, weber, bar, are, still, operated, cryogenically, cooled, with, superconducting, quantum, interference, devices, to, detect, vibration, weber, bars, are, not, sensitive, enough, to, detect, anything, but, extremely, powerful, gravitational, waves, minigrail, is, a, spherical, gravitational, wave, antenna, using, this, principle, it, is, based, at, leiden, university, consisting, of, an, exactingly, machined, 1, 150, kg, sphere, cryogenically, cooled, to, 20, millikelvins, the, spherical, configuration, allows, for, equal, sensitivity, in, all, directions, and, is, somewhat, experimentally, simpler, than, larger, linear, devices, requiring, high, vacuum, events, are, detected, by, measuring, deformation, of, the, detector, sphere, minigrail, is, highly, sensitive, in, the, 2, 4, khz, range, suitable, for, detecting, gravitational, waves, from, rotating, neutron, star, instabilities, or, small, black, hole, mergers, there, are, currently, two, detectors, focused, on, the, higher, end, of, the, gravitational, wave, spectrum, 10, 7, to, 10, 5, hz, one, at, university, of, birmingham, england, and, the, other, at, infn, genoa, italy, a, third, is, under, development, at, chongqing, university, china, the, birmingham, detector, measures, changes, in, the, polarization, state, of, a, microwave, beam, circulating, in, a, closed, loop, about, one, meter, across, both, detectors, are, expected, to, be, sensitive, to, periodic, spacetime, strains, of, h, 2, 10, 13, hz, given, as, an, amplitude, spectral, density, the, infn, genoa, detector, is, a, resonant, antenna, consisting, of, two, coupled, spherical, superconducting, harmonic, oscillators, a, few, centimeters, in, diameter, the, oscillators, are, designed, to, have, when, uncoupled, almost, equal, resonant, frequencies, the, system, is, currently, expected, to, have, a, sensitivity, to, periodic, spacetime, strains, of, h, 2, 10, 17, hz, with, an, expectation, to, reach, a, sensitivity, of, h, 2, 10, 20, hz, the, chongqing, university, detector, is, planned, to, detect, relic, high, frequency, gravitational, waves, with, the, predicted, typical, parameters, 10, 11, hz, 100, ghz, and, h, 10, 30, to, 10, 32, a, more, sensitive, class, of, detector, uses, a, laser, michelson, interferometer, to, measure, gravitational, wave, induced, motion, between, separated, free, masses, this, allows, the, masses, to, be, separated, by, large, distances, increasing, the, signal, size, a, further, advantage, is, that, it, is, sensitive, to, a, wide, range, of, frequencies, not, just, those, near, a, resonance, as, is, the, case, for, weber, bars, after, years, of, development, ground, based, interferometers, made, the, first, detection, of, gravitational, waves, in, 2015, currently, the, most, sensitive, is, ligo, the, laser, interferometer, gravitational, wave, observatory, ligo, has, three, detectors, one, in, livingston, louisiana, one, at, the, hanford, site, in, richland, washington, and, a, third, formerly, installed, as, a, second, detector, at, hanford, that, is, planned, to, be, moved, to, india, each, observatory, has, two, light, storage, arms, that, are, 4, kilometers, in, length, these, are, at, 90, degree, angles, to, each, other, with, the, light, passing, through, 1, m, diameter, vacuum, tubes, running, the, entire, 4, kilometers, a, passing, gravitational, wave, will, slightly, stretch, one, arm, as, it, shortens, the, other, this, is, the, motion, to, which, an, interferometer, is, most, sensitive, even, with, such, long, arms, the, strongest, gravitational, waves, will, only, change, the, distance, between, the, ends, of, the, arms, by, at, most, roughly, 10, 18, m, ligo, should, be, able, to, detect, gravitational, waves, as, small, as, h, 5, 10, 22, upgrades, to, ligo, and, virgo, should, increase, the, sensitivity, still, further, another, highly, sensitive, interferometer, kagra, which, is, located, in, the, kamioka, observatory, in, japan, is, in, operation, since, february, 2020, a, key, point, is, that, a, tenfold, increase, in, sensitivity, radius, of, reach, increases, the, volume, of, space, accessible, to, the, instrument, by, one, thousand, times, this, increases, the, rate, at, which, detectable, signals, might, be, seen, from, one, per, tens, of, years, of, observation, to, tens, per, year, interferometric, detectors, are, limited, at, high, frequencies, by, shot, noise, which, occurs, because, the, lasers, produce, photons, randomly, one, analogy, is, to, rainfall, the, rate, of, rainfall, like, the, laser, intensity, is, measurable, but, the, raindrops, like, photons, fall, at, random, times, causing, fluctuations, around, the, average, value, this, leads, to, noise, at, the, output, of, the, detector, much, like, radio, static, in, addition, for, sufficiently, high, laser, power, the, random, momentum, transferred, to, the, test, masses, by, the, laser, photons, shakes, the, mirrors, masking, signals, of, low, frequencies, thermal, noise, e, g, brownian, motion, is, another, limit, to, sensitivity, in, addition, to, these, stationary, constant, noise, sources, all, ground, based, detectors, are, also, limited, at, low, frequencies, by, seismic, noise, and, other, forms, of, environmental, vibration, and, other, non, stationary, noise, sources, creaks, in, mechanical, structures, lightning, or, other, large, electrical, disturbances, etc, may, also, create, noise, masking, an, event, or, may, even, imitate, an, event, all, of, these, must, be, taken, into, account, and, excluded, by, analysis, before, detection, may, be, considered, a, true, gravitational, wave, event, the, simplest, gravitational, waves, are, those, with, constant, frequency, the, waves, given, off, by, a, spinning, non, axisymmetric, neutron, star, would, be, approximately, monochromatic, a, pure, tone, in, acoustics, unlike, signals, from, supernovae, or, binary, black, holes, these, signals, evolve, little, in, amplitude, or, frequency, over, the, period, it, would, be, observed, by, ground, based, detectors, however, there, would, be, some, change, in, the, measured, signal, because, of, doppler, shifting, caused, by, the, motion, of, the, earth, despite, the, signals, being, simple, detection, is, extremely, computationally, expensive, because, of, the, long, stretches, of, data, that, must, be, analysed, the, einstein, home, project, is, a, distributed, computing, project, similar, to, seti, home, intended, to, detect, this, type, of, gravitational, wave, by, taking, data, from, ligo, and, geo, and, sending, it, out, in, little, pieces, to, thousands, of, volunteers, for, parallel, analysis, on, their, home, computers, einstein, home, can, sift, through, the, data, far, more, quickly, than, would, be, possible, otherwise, space, based, interferometers, such, as, lisa, and, decigo, are, also, being, developed, lisa, s, design, calls, for, three, test, masses, forming, an, equilateral, triangle, with, lasers, from, each, spacecraft, to, each, other, spacecraft, forming, two, independent, interferometers, lisa, is, planned, to, occupy, a, solar, orbit, trailing, the, earth, with, each, arm, of, the, triangle, being, five, million, kilometers, this, puts, the, detector, in, an, excellent, vacuum, far, from, earth, based, sources, of, noise, though, it, will, still, be, susceptible, to, heat, shot, noise, and, artifacts, caused, by, cosmic, rays, and, solar, wind, pulsars, are, rapidly, rotating, stars, a, pulsar, emits, beams, of, radio, waves, that, like, lighthouse, beams, sweep, through, the, sky, as, the, pulsar, rotates, the, signal, from, a, pulsar, can, be, detected, by, radio, telescopes, as, a, series, of, regularly, spaced, pulses, essentially, like, the, ticks, of, a, clock, gws, affect, the, time, it, takes, the, pulses, to, travel, from, the, pulsar, to, a, telescope, on, earth, a, pulsar, timing, array, uses, millisecond, pulsars, to, seek, out, perturbations, due, to, gws, in, measurements, of, the, time, of, arrival, of, pulses, to, a, telescope, in, other, words, to, look, for, deviations, in, the, clock, ticks, to, detect, gws, pulsar, timing, arrays, search, for, a, distinct, quadrupolar, pattern, of, correlation, and, anti, correlation, between, the, time, of, arrival, of, pulses, from, different, pulsar, pairs, as, a, function, of, their, angular, separation, in, the, sky, although, pulsar, pulses, travel, through, space, for, hundreds, or, thousands, of, years, to, reach, us, pulsar, timing, arrays, are, sensitive, to, perturbations, in, their, travel, time, of, much, less, than, a, millionth, of, a, second, the, most, likely, source, of, gws, to, which, pulsar, timing, arrays, are, sensitive, are, supermassive, black, hole, binaries, which, form, from, the, collision, of, galaxies, in, addition, to, individual, binary, systems, pulsar, timing, arrays, are, sensitive, to, a, stochastic, background, of, gws, made, from, the, sum, of, gws, from, many, galaxy, mergers, other, potential, signal, sources, include, cosmic, strings, and, the, primordial, background, of, gws, from, cosmic, inflation, globally, there, are, three, active, pulsar, timing, array, projects, the, north, american, nanohertz, observatory, for, gravitational, waves, uses, data, collected, by, the, arecibo, radio, telescope, and, green, bank, telescope, the, australian, parkes, pulsar, timing, array, uses, data, from, the, parkes, radio, telescope, the, european, pulsar, timing, array, uses, data, from, the, four, largest, telescopes, in, europe, the, lovell, telescope, the, westerbork, synthesis, radio, telescope, the, effelsberg, telescope, and, the, nancay, radio, telescope, these, three, groups, also, collaborate, under, the, title, of, the, international, pulsar, timing, array, project, in, june, 2023, nanograv, published, the, 15, year, data, release, which, contained, the, first, evidence, for, a, stochastic, gravitational, wave, background, in, particular, it, included, the, first, measurement, of, the, hellings, downs, curve, the, tell, tale, sign, of, the, gravitational, wave, origin, of, the, observed, background, primordial, gravitational, waves, are, gravitational, waves, observed, in, the, cosmic, microwave, background, they, were, allegedly, detected, by, the, bicep2, instrument, an, announcement, made, on, 17, march, 2014, which, was, withdrawn, on, 30, january, 2015, the, signal, can, be, entirely, attributed, to, dust, in, the, milky, way, on, 11, february, 2016, the, ligo, collaboration, announced, the, first, observation, of, gravitational, waves, from, a, signal, detected, at, 09, 50, 45, gmt, on, 14, september, 2015, of, two, black, holes, with, masses, of, 29, and, 36, solar, masses, merging, about, 1, 3, billion, light, years, away, during, the, final, fraction, of, a, second, of, the, merger, it, released, more, than, 50, times, the, power, of, all, the, stars, in, the, observable, universe, combined, the, signal, increased, in, frequency, from, 35, to, 250, hz, over, 10, cycles, 5, orbits, as, it, rose, in, strength, for, a, period, of, 0, 2, second, the, mass, of, the, new, merged, black, hole, was, 62, solar, masses, energy, equivalent, to, three, solar, masses, was, emitted, as, gravitational, waves, the, signal, was, seen, by, both, ligo, detectors, in, livingston, and, hanford, with, a, time, difference, of, 7, milliseconds, due, to, the, angle, between, the, two, detectors, and, the, source, the, signal, came, from, the, southern, celestial, hemisphere, in, the, rough, direction, of, but, much, farther, away, than, the, magellanic, clouds, the, gravitational, waves, were, observed, in, the, region, more, than, 5, sigma, in, other, words, 99, 99997, chances, of, showing, getting, the, same, result, the, probability, of, finding, enough, to, have, been, assessed, considered, as, the, evidence, proof, in, an, experiment, of, statistical, physics, since, then, ligo, and, virgo, have, reported, more, gravitational, wave, observations, from, merging, black, hole, binaries, on, 16, october, 2017, the, ligo, and, virgo, collaborations, announced, the, first, ever, detection, of, gravitational, waves, originating, from, the, coalescence, of, a, binary, neutron, star, system, the, observation, of, the, gw170817, transient, which, occurred, on, 17, august, 2017, allowed, for, constraining, the, masses, of, the, neutron, stars, involved, between, 0, 86, and, 2, 26, solar, masses, further, analysis, allowed, a, greater, restriction, of, the, mass, values, to, the, interval, 1, 17, 1, 60, solar, masses, with, the, total, system, mass, measured, to, be, 2, 73, 2, 78, solar, masses, the, inclusion, of, the, virgo, detector, in, the, observation, effort, allowed, for, an, improvement, of, the, localization, of, the, source, by, a, factor, of, 10, this, in, turn, facilitated, the, electromagnetic, follow, up, of, the, event, in, contrast, to, the, case, of, binary, black, hole, mergers, binary, neutron, star, mergers, were, expected, to, yield, an, electromagnetic, counterpart, that, is, a, light, signal, associated, with, the, event, a, gamma, ray, burst, grb, 170817a, was, detected, by, the, fermi, gamma, ray, space, telescope, occurring, 1, 7, seconds, after, the, gravitational, wave, transient, the, signal, originating, near, the, galaxy, ngc, 4993, was, associated, with, the, neutron, star, merger, this, was, corroborated, by, the, electromagnetic, follow, up, of, the, event, at, 2017gfo, involving, 70, telescopes, and, observatories, and, yielding, observations, over, a, large, region, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, which, further, confirmed, the, neutron, star, nature, of, the, merged, objects, and, the, associated, kilonova, in, 2021, the, detection, of, the, first, two, neutron, star, black, hole, binaries, by, the, ligo, and, virgo, detectors, was, published, in, the, astrophysical, journal, letters, allowing, to, first, set, bounds, on, the, quantity, of, such, systems, no, neutron, star, black, hole, binary, had, ever, been, observed, using, conventional, means, before, the, gravitational, observation, in, 1964, l, halpern, and, b, laurent, theoretically, proved, that, gravitational, spin, 2, electron, transitions, are, possible, in, atoms, compared, to, electric, and, magnetic, transitions, the, emission, probability, is, extremely, low, stimulated, emission, was, discussed, for, increasing, the, efficiency, of, the, process, due, to, the, lack, of, mirrors, or, resonators, for, gravitational, waves, they, determined, that, a, single, pass, gaser, a, kind, of, laser, emitting, gravitational, waves, is, practically, unfeasible, in, 1998, the, possibility, of, a, different, implementation, of, the, above, theoretical, analysis, was, proposed, by, giorgio, fontana, the, required, coherence, for, a, practical, gaser, could, be, obtained, by, cooper, pairs, in, superconductors, that, are, characterized, by, a, macroscopic, collective, wave, function, cuprate, high, temperature, superconductors, are, characterized, by, the, presence, of, s, wave, and, d, wave, cooper, pairs, transitions, between, s, wave, and, d, wave, are, gravitational, spin, 2, out, of, equilibrium, conditions, can, be, induced, by, injecting, s, wave, cooper, pairs, from, a, low, temperature, superconductor, for, instance, lead, or, niobium, which, is, pure, s, wave, by, means, of, a, josephson, junction, with, high, critical, current, the, amplification, mechanism, can, be, described, as, the, effect, of, superradiance, and, 10, cubic, centimeters, of, cuprate, high, temperature, superconductor, seem, sufficient, for, the, mechanism, to, properly, work, a, detailed, description, of, the, approach, can, be, found, in, high, temperature, superconductors, as, quantum, sources, of, gravitational, waves, the, htsc, gaser, chapter, 3, of, this, book, an, episode, of, the, 1962, russian, science, fiction, novel, space, apprentice, by, arkady, and, boris, strugatsky, shows, the, experiment, monitoring, the, propagation, of, gravitational, waves, at, the, expense, of, annihilating, a, chunk, of, asteroid, 15, eunomia, the, size, of, mount, everest, in, stanislaw, lem, s, 1986, novel, fiasco, a, gravity, gun, or, gracer, gravity, amplification, by, collimated, emission, of, resonance, is, used, to, reshape, a, collapsar, so, that, the, protagonists, can, exploit, the, extreme, relativistic, effects, and, make, an, interstellar, journey, in, greg, egan, s, 1997, novel, diaspora, the, analysis, of, a, gravitational, wave, signal, from, the, inspiral, of, a, nearby, binary, neutron, star, reveals, that, its, collision, and, merger, is, imminent, implying,
