a, peninsula, is, a, landform, that, extends, from, a, mainland, and, is, surrounded, by, water, on, most, sides, peninsulas, exist, on, all, continents, the, largest, peninsula, in, the, world, is, the, arabian, peninsula, the, word, peninsula, derives, from, latin, paeninsula, from, paene, almost, and, insula, island, the, word, entered, english, in, the, 16th, century, a, peninsula, is, generally, defined, as, a, piece, of, land, surrounded, on, most, sides, by, water, a, peninsula, may, be, bordered, by, more, than, one, body, of, water, and, the, body, of, water, does, not, have, to, be, an, ocean, or, a, sea, a, piece, of, land, on, a, very, tight, river, bend, or, one, between, two, rivers, is, sometimes, said, to, form, a, peninsula, for, example, in, the, new, barbadoes, neck, in, new, jersey, united, states, a, peninsula, may, be, connected, to, the, mainland, via, an, isthmus, for, example, in, the, isthmus, of, corinth, which, connects, to, the, peloponnese, peninsula, peninsulas, can, be, formed, from, continental, drift, glacial, erosion, glacial, meltwater, glacial, deposition, marine, sediment, marine, transgressions, volcanoes, divergent, boundaries, or, river, sedimentation, more, than, one, factor, may, play, into, the, formation, of, a, peninsula, for, example, in, the, case, of, florida, continental, drift, marine, sediment, and, marine, transgressions, were, all, contributing, factors, to, its, shape, in, the, case, of, formation, from, glaciers, e, g, the, antarctic, peninsula, or, cape, cod, peninsulas, can, be, created, due, to, glacial, erosion, meltwater, or, deposition, if, erosion, formed, the, peninsula, softer, and, harder, rocks, were, present, and, since, the, glacier, only, erodes, softer, rock, it, formed, a, basin, this, may, create, peninsulas, and, occurred, for, example, in, the, keweenaw, peninsula, in, the, case, of, formation, from, meltwater, melting, glaciers, deposit, sediment, and, form, moraines, which, act, as, dams, for, the, meltwater, this, may, create, bodies, of, water, that, surround, the, land, forming, peninsulas, if, deposition, formed, the, peninsula, the, peninsula, was, composed, of, sedimentary, rock, which, was, created, from, a, large, deposit, of, glacial, drift, the, hill, of, drift, becomes, a, peninsula, if, the, hill, formed, near, water, but, was, still, connected, to, the, mainland, for, example, during, the, formation, of, cape, cod, about, 23, 000, years, ago, in, the, case, of, formation, from, volcanoes, when, a, volcano, erupts, magma, near, water, it, may, form, a, peninsula, e, g, the, alaskan, peninsula, peninsulas, formed, from, volcanoes, are, especially, common, when, the, volcano, erupts, near, shallow, water, marine, sediment, may, form, peninsulas, by, the, creation, of, limestone, a, rift, peninsula, may, form, as, a, result, of, a, divergent, boundary, in, plate, tectonics, e, g, the, arabian, peninsula, while, a, convergent, boundary, may, also, form, peninsulas, e, g, gibraltar, or, the, indian, subcontinent, peninsulas, can, also, form, due, to, sedimentation, in, rivers, when, a, river, carrying, sediment, flows, into, an, ocean, the, sediment, is, deposited, forming, a, delta, peninsula, marine, transgressions, changes, in, sea, level, may, form, peninsulas, but, also, may, affect, existing, peninsulas, for, example, the, water, level, may, change, which, causes, a, peninsula, to, become, an, island, during, high, water, levels, similarly, wet, weather, causing, higher, water, levels, make, peninsulas, appear, smaller, while, dry, weather, make, them, appear, larger, sea, level, rise, from, global, warming, will, permanently, reduce, the, size, of, some, peninsulas, over, time, peninsulas, are, noted, for, their, use, as, shelter, for, humans, and, neanderthals, the, landform, is, advantageous, because, it, gives, hunting, access, to, both, land, and, sea, animals, they, can, also, serve, as, markers, of, a, nation, s, borders
