the, atomic, number, or, nuclear, charge, number, symbol, z, of, a, chemical, element, is, the, charge, number, of, an, atomic, nucleus, for, ordinary, nuclei, composed, of, protons, and, neutrons, this, is, equal, to, the, proton, number, n, p, or, the, number, of, protons, found, in, the, nucleus, of, every, atom, of, that, element, the, atomic, number, can, be, used, to, uniquely, identify, ordinary, chemical, elements, in, an, ordinary, uncharged, atom, the, atomic, number, is, also, equal, to, the, number, of, electrons, for, an, ordinary, atom, which, contains, protons, neutrons, and, electrons, the, sum, of, the, atomic, number, z, and, the, neutron, number, n, gives, the, atom, s, atomic, mass, number, a, since, protons, and, neutrons, have, approximately, the, same, mass, and, the, mass, of, the, electrons, is, negligible, for, many, purposes, and, the, mass, defect, of, the, nucleon, binding, is, always, small, compared, to, the, nucleon, mass, the, atomic, mass, of, any, atom, when, expressed, in, daltons, making, a, quantity, called, the, relative, isotopic, mass, is, within, 1, of, the, whole, number, a, atoms, with, the, same, atomic, number, but, different, neutron, numbers, and, hence, different, mass, numbers, are, known, as, isotopes, a, little, more, than, three, quarters, of, naturally, occurring, elements, exist, as, a, mixture, of, isotopes, see, monoisotopic, elements, and, the, average, isotopic, mass, of, an, isotopic, mixture, for, an, element, called, the, relative, atomic, mass, in, a, defined, environment, on, earth, determines, the, element, s, standard, atomic, weight, historically, it, was, these, atomic, weights, of, elements, in, comparison, to, hydrogen, that, were, the, quantities, measurable, by, chemists, in, the, 19th, century, the, conventional, symbol, z, comes, from, the, german, word, z, ahl, number, which, before, the, modern, synthesis, of, ideas, from, chemistry, and, physics, merely, denoted, an, element, s, numerical, place, in, the, periodic, table, whose, order, was, then, approximately, but, not, completely, consistent, with, the, order, of, the, elements, by, atomic, weights, only, after, 1915, with, the, suggestion, and, evidence, that, this, z, number, was, also, the, nuclear, charge, and, a, physical, characteristic, of, atoms, did, the, word, atom, z, ahl, and, its, english, equivalent, atomic, number, come, into, common, use, in, this, context, the, rules, above, do, not, always, apply, to, exotic, atoms, which, contain, short, lived, elementary, particles, other, than, protons, neutrons, and, electrons, loosely, speaking, the, existence, or, construction, of, a, periodic, table, of, elements, creates, an, ordering, of, the, elements, and, so, they, can, be, numbered, in, order, dmitri, mendeleev, said, that, he, arranged, his, first, periodic, tables, first, published, on, march, 6, 1869, in, order, of, atomic, weight, atomgewicht, however, in, consideration, of, the, elements, observed, chemical, properties, he, changed, the, order, slightly, and, placed, tellurium, atomic, weight, 127, 6, ahead, of, iodine, atomic, weight, 126, 9, this, placement, is, consistent, with, the, modern, practice, of, ordering, the, elements, by, proton, number, z, but, that, number, was, not, known, or, suspected, at, the, time, a, simple, numbering, based, on, periodic, table, position, was, never, entirely, satisfactory, in, addition, to, the, case, of, iodine, and, tellurium, several, other, pairs, of, elements, such, as, argon, and, potassium, cobalt, and, nickel, were, later, shown, to, have, nearly, identical, or, reversed, atomic, weights, thus, requiring, their, placement, in, the, periodic, table, to, be, determined, by, their, chemical, properties, however, the, gradual, identification, of, more, and, more, chemically, similar, lanthanide, elements, whose, atomic, number, was, not, obvious, led, to, inconsistency, and, uncertainty, in, the, periodic, numbering, of, elements, at, least, from, lutetium, element, 71, onward, hafnium, was, not, known, at, this, time, in, 1911, ernest, rutherford, gave, a, model, of, the, atom, in, which, a, central, nucleus, held, most, of, the, atom, s, mass, and, a, positive, charge, which, in, units, of, the, electron, s, charge, was, to, be, approximately, equal, to, half, of, the, atom, s, atomic, weight, expressed, in, numbers, of, hydrogen, atoms, this, central, charge, would, thus, be, approximately, half, the, atomic, weight, though, it, was, almost, 25, different, from, the, atomic, number, of, gold, z, 79, a, 197, the, single, element, from, which, rutherford, made, his, guess, nevertheless, in, spite, of, rutherford, s, estimation, that, gold, had, a, central, charge, of, about, 100, but, was, element, z, 79, on, the, periodic, table, a, month, after, rutherford, s, paper, appeared, antonius, van, den, broek, first, formally, suggested, that, the, central, charge, and, number, of, electrons, in, an, atom, were, exactly, equal, to, its, place, in, the, periodic, table, also, known, as, element, number, atomic, number, and, symbolized, z, this, eventually, proved, to, be, the, case, the, experimental, position, improved, dramatically, after, research, by, henry, moseley, in, 1913, moseley, after, discussions, with, bohr, who, was, at, the, same, lab, and, who, had, used, van, den, broek, s, hypothesis, in, his, bohr, model, of, the, atom, decided, to, test, van, den, broek, s, and, bohr, s, hypothesis, directly, by, seeing, if, spectral, lines, emitted, from, excited, atoms, fitted, the, bohr, theory, s, postulation, that, the, frequency, of, the, spectral, lines, be, proportional, to, the, square, of, z, to, do, this, moseley, measured, the, wavelengths, of, the, innermost, photon, transitions, k, and, l, lines, produced, by, the, elements, from, aluminium, z, 13, to, gold, z, 79, used, as, a, series, of, movable, anodic, targets, inside, an, x, ray, tube, the, square, root, of, the, frequency, of, these, photons, x, rays, increased, from, one, target, to, the, next, in, an, arithmetic, progression, this, led, to, the, conclusion, moseley, s, law, that, the, atomic, number, does, closely, correspond, with, an, offset, of, one, unit, for, k, lines, in, moseley, s, work, to, the, calculated, electric, charge, of, the, nucleus, i, e, the, element, number, z, among, other, things, moseley, demonstrated, that, the, lanthanide, series, from, lanthanum, to, lutetium, inclusive, must, have, 15, members, no, fewer, and, no, more, which, was, far, from, obvious, from, known, chemistry, at, that, time, after, moseley, s, death, in, 1915, the, atomic, numbers, of, all, known, elements, from, hydrogen, to, uranium, z, 92, were, examined, by, his, method, there, were, seven, elements, with, z, 92, which, were, not, found, and, therefore, identified, as, still, undiscovered, corresponding, to, atomic, numbers, 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, 87, and, 91, from, 1918, to, 1947, all, seven, of, these, missing, elements, were, discovered, by, this, time, the, first, four, transuranium, elements, had, also, been, discovered, so, that, the, periodic, table, was, complete, with, no, gaps, as, far, as, curium, z, 96, in, 1915, the, reason, for, nuclear, charge, being, quantized, in, units, of, z, which, were, now, recognized, to, be, the, same, as, the, element, number, was, not, understood, an, old, idea, called, prout, s, hypothesis, had, postulated, that, the, elements, were, all, made, of, residues, or, protyles, of, the, lightest, element, hydrogen, which, in, the, bohr, rutherford, model, had, a, single, electron, and, a, nuclear, charge, of, one, however, as, early, as, 1907, rutherford, and, thomas, royds, had, shown, that, alpha, particles, which, had, a, charge, of, 2, were, the, nuclei, of, helium, atoms, which, had, a, mass, four, times, that, of, hydrogen, not, two, times, if, prout, s, hypothesis, were, true, something, had, to, be, neutralizing, some, of, the, charge, of, the, hydrogen, nuclei, present, in, the, nuclei, of, heavier, atoms, in, 1917, rutherford, succeeded, in, generating, hydrogen, nuclei, from, a, nuclear, reaction, between, alpha, particles, and, nitrogen, gas, and, believed, he, had, proven, prout, s, law, he, called, the, new, heavy, nuclear, particles, protons, in, 1920, alternate, names, being, proutons, and, protyles, it, had, been, immediately, apparent, from, the, work, of, moseley, that, the, nuclei, of, heavy, atoms, have, more, than, twice, as, much, mass, as, would, be, expected, from, their, being, made, of, hydrogen, nuclei, and, thus, there, was, required, a, hypothesis, for, the, neutralization, of, the, extra, protons, presumed, present, in, all, heavy, nuclei, a, helium, nucleus, was, presumed, to, be, composed, of, four, protons, plus, two, nuclear, electrons, electrons, bound, inside, the, nucleus, to, cancel, two, of, the, charges, at, the, other, end, of, the, periodic, table, a, nucleus, of, gold, with, a, mass, 197, times, that, of, hydrogen, was, thought, to, contain, 118, nuclear, electrons, in, the, nucleus, to, give, it, a, residual, charge, of, 79, consistent, with, its, atomic, number, all, consideration, of, nuclear, electrons, ended, with, james, chadwick, s, discovery, of, the, neutron, in, 1932, an, atom, of, gold, now, was, seen, as, containing, 118, neutrons, rather, than, 118, nuclear, electrons, and, its, positive, nuclear, charge, now, was, realized, to, come, entirely, from, a, content, of, 79, protons, since, moseley, had, previously, shown, that, the, atomic, number, z, of, an, element, equals, this, positive, charge, it, was, now, clear, that, z, is, identical, to, the, number, of, protons, of, its, nuclei, each, element, has, a, specific, set, of, chemical, properties, as, a, consequence, of, the, number, of, electrons, present, in, the, neutral, atom, which, is, z, the, atomic, number, the, configuration, of, these, electrons, follows, from, the, principles, of, quantum, mechanics, the, number, of, electrons, in, each, element, s, electron, shells, particularly, the, outermost, valence, shell, is, the, primary, factor, in, determining, its, chemical, bonding, behavior, hence, it, is, the, atomic, number, alone, that, determines, the, chemical, properties, of, an, element, and, it, is, for, this, reason, that, an, element, can, be, defined, as, consisting, of, any, mixture, of, atoms, with, a, given, atomic, number, the, quest, for, new, elements, is, usually, described, using, atomic, numbers, as, of, 2024, all, elements, with, atomic, numbers, 1, to, 118, have, been, observed, synthesis, of, new, elements, is, accomplished, by, bombarding, target, atoms, of, heavy, elements, with, ions, such, that, the, sum, of, the, atomic, numbers, of, the, target, and, ion, elements, equals, the, atomic, number, of, the, element, being, created, in, general, the, half, life, of, a, nuclide, becomes, shorter, as, atomic, number, increases, though, undiscovered, nuclides, with, certain, magic, numbers, of, protons, and, neutrons, may, have, relatively, longer, half, lives, and, comprise, an, island, of, stability, a, hypothetical, element, composed, only, of, neutrons, neutronium, has, also, been, proposed, and, would, have, atomic, number, 0, but, has, never, been, observed
