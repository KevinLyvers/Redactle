fluid, mechanics, is, the, branch, of, physics, concerned, with, the, mechanics, of, fluids, liquids, gases, and, plasmas, and, the, forces, on, them, 3, it, has, applications, in, a, wide, range, of, disciplines, including, mechanical, aerospace, civil, chemical, and, biomedical, engineering, as, well, as, geophysics, oceanography, meteorology, astrophysics, and, biology, it, can, be, divided, into, fluid, statics, the, study, of, fluids, at, rest, and, fluid, dynamics, the, study, of, the, effect, of, forces, on, fluid, motion, 3, it, is, a, branch, of, continuum, mechanics, a, subject, which, models, matter, without, using, the, information, that, it, is, made, out, of, atoms, that, is, it, models, matter, from, a, macroscopic, viewpoint, rather, than, from, microscopic, fluid, mechanics, especially, fluid, dynamics, is, an, active, field, of, research, typically, mathematically, complex, many, problems, are, partly, or, wholly, unsolved, and, are, best, addressed, by, numerical, methods, typically, using, computers, a, modern, discipline, called, computational, fluid, dynamics, cfd, is, devoted, to, this, approach, particle, image, velocimetry, an, experimental, method, for, visualizing, and, analyzing, fluid, flow, also, takes, advantage, of, the, highly, visual, nature, of, fluid, flow, the, study, of, fluid, mechanics, goes, back, at, least, to, the, days, of, ancient, greece, when, archimedes, investigated, fluid, statics, and, buoyancy, and, formulated, his, famous, law, known, now, as, the, archimedes, principle, which, was, published, in, his, work, on, floating, bodies, generally, considered, to, be, the, first, major, work, on, fluid, mechanics, iranian, scholar, abu, rayhan, biruni, and, later, al, khazini, applied, experimental, scientific, methods, to, fluid, mechanics, rapid, advancement, in, fluid, mechanics, began, with, leonardo, da, vinci, observations, and, experiments, evangelista, torricelli, invented, the, barometer, isaac, newton, investigated, viscosity, and, blaise, pascal, researched, hydrostatics, formulated, pascal, s, law, and, was, continued, by, daniel, bernoulli, with, the, introduction, of, mathematical, fluid, dynamics, in, hydrodynamica, 1739, inviscid, flow, was, further, analyzed, by, various, mathematicians, jean, le, rond, d, alembert, joseph, louis, lagrange, pierre, simon, laplace, sim, on, denis, poisson, and, viscous, flow, was, explored, by, a, multitude, of, engineers, including, jean, l, onard, marie, poiseuille, and, gotthilf, hagen, further, mathematical, justification, was, provided, by, claude, louis, navier, and, george, gabriel, stokes, in, the, navier, stokes, equations, and, boundary, layers, were, investigated, ludwig, prandtl, theodore, von, k, rm, n, while, various, scientists, such, as, osborne, reynolds, andrey, kolmogorov, and, geoffrey, ingram, taylor, advanced, the, understanding, of, fluid, viscosity, and, turbulence, fluid, statics, or, hydrostatics, is, the, branch, of, fluid, mechanics, that, studies, fluids, at, rest, it, embraces, the, study, of, the, conditions, under, which, fluids, are, at, rest, in, stable, equilibrium, and, is, contrasted, with, fluid, dynamics, the, study, of, fluids, in, motion, hydrostatics, offers, physical, explanations, for, many, phenomena, of, everyday, life, such, as, why, atmospheric, pressure, changes, with, altitude, why, wood, and, oil, float, on, water, and, why, the, surface, of, water, is, always, level, whatever, the, shape, of, its, container, hydrostatics, is, fundamental, to, hydraulics, the, engineering, of, equipment, for, storing, transporting, and, using, fluids, it, is, also, relevant, to, some, aspects, of, geophysics, and, astrophysics, for, example, in, understanding, plate, tectonics, and, anomalies, in, the, earth, s, gravitational, field, to, meteorology, to, medicine, in, the, context, of, blood, pressure, and, many, other, fields, fluid, dynamics, is, a, subdiscipline, of, fluid, mechanics, that, deals, with, fluid, flow, the, science, of, liquids, and, gases, in, motion, fluid, dynamics, offers, a, systematic, structure, which, underlies, these, practical, disciplines, that, embraces, empirical, and, semi, empirical, laws, derived, from, flow, measurement, and, used, to, solve, practical, problems, the, solution, to, a, fluid, dynamics, problem, typically, involves, calculating, various, properties, of, the, fluid, such, as, velocity, pressure, density, and, temperature, as, functions, of, space, and, time, it, has, several, subdisciplines, itself, including, aerodynamics, the, study, of, air, and, other, gases, in, motion, and, hydrodynamics, the, study, of, liquids, in, motion, fluid, dynamics, has, a, wide, range, of, applications, including, calculating, forces, and, movements, on, aircraft, determining, the, mass, flow, rate, of, petroleum, through, pipelines, predicting, evolving, weather, patterns, understanding, nebulae, in, interstellar, space, and, modeling, explosions, some, fluid, dynamical, principles, are, used, in, traffic, engineering, and, crowd, dynamics, fluid, mechanics, is, a, subdiscipline, of, continuum, mechanics, as, illustrated, in, the, following, table, in, a, mechanical, view, a, fluid, is, a, substance, that, does, not, support, shear, stress, that, is, why, a, fluid, at, rest, has, the, shape, of, its, containing, vessel, a, fluid, at, rest, has, no, shear, stress, the, assumptions, inherent, to, a, fluid, mechanical, treatment, of, a, physical, system, can, be, expressed, in, terms, of, mathematical, equations, fundamentally, every, fluid, mechanical, system, is, assumed, to, obey, for, example, the, assumption, that, mass, is, conserved, means, that, for, any, fixed, control, volume, for, example, a, spherical, volume, enclosed, by, a, control, surface, the, rate, of, change, of, the, mass, contained, in, that, volume, is, equal, to, the, rate, at, which, mass, is, passing, through, the, surface, from, outside, to, inside, minus, the, rate, at, which, mass, is, passing, from, inside, to, outside, this, can, be, expressed, as, an, equation, in, integral, form, over, the, control, volume, 74, the, continuum, assumption, is, an, idealization, of, continuum, mechanics, under, which, fluids, can, be, treated, as, continuous, even, though, on, a, microscopic, scale, they, are, composed, of, molecules, under, the, continuum, assumption, macroscopic, observed, measurable, properties, such, as, density, pressure, temperature, and, bulk, velocity, are, taken, to, be, well, defined, at, infinitesimal, volume, elements, small, in, comparison, to, the, characteristic, length, scale, of, the, system, but, large, in, comparison, to, molecular, length, scale, fluid, properties, can, vary, continuously, from, one, volume, element, to, another, and, are, average, values, of, the, molecular, properties, the, continuum, hypothesis, can, lead, to, inaccurate, results, in, applications, like, supersonic, speed, flows, or, molecular, flows, on, nano, scale, those, problems, for, which, the, continuum, hypothesis, fails, can, be, solved, using, statistical, mechanics, to, determine, whether, or, not, the, continuum, hypothesis, applies, the, knudsen, number, defined, as, the, ratio, of, the, molecular, mean, free, path, to, the, characteristic, length, scale, is, evaluated, problems, with, knudsen, numbers, below, 0, 1, can, be, evaluated, using, the, continuum, hypothesis, but, molecular, approach, statistical, mechanics, can, be, applied, to, find, the, fluid, motion, for, larger, knudsen, numbers, the, navier, stokes, equations, named, after, claude, louis, navier, and, george, gabriel, stokes, are, differential, equations, that, describe, the, force, balance, at, a, given, point, within, a, fluid, for, an, incompressible, fluid, with, vector, velocity, field, u, displaystyle, mathbf, u, the, navier, stokes, equations, are, these, differential, equations, are, the, analogues, for, deformable, materials, to, newton, s, equations, of, motion, for, particles, the, navier, stokes, equations, describe, changes, in, momentum, force, in, response, to, pressure, p, displaystyle, p, and, viscosity, parameterized, by, the, kinematic, viscosity, displaystyle, nu, occasionally, body, forces, such, as, the, gravitational, force, or, lorentz, force, are, added, to, the, equations, solutions, of, the, navier, stokes, equations, for, a, given, physical, problem, must, be, sought, with, the, help, of, calculus, in, practical, terms, only, the, simplest, cases, can, be, solved, exactly, in, this, way, these, cases, generally, involve, non, turbulent, steady, flow, in, which, the, reynolds, number, is, small, for, more, complex, cases, especially, those, involving, turbulence, such, as, global, weather, systems, aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, and, many, more, solutions, of, the, navier, stokes, equations, can, currently, only, be, found, with, the, help, of, computers, this, branch, of, science, is, called, computational, fluid, dynamics, an, inviscid, fluid, has, no, viscosity, 0, displaystyle, nu, 0, in, practice, an, inviscid, flow, is, an, idealization, one, that, facilitates, mathematical, treatment, in, fact, purely, inviscid, flows, are, only, known, to, be, realized, in, the, case, of, superfluidity, otherwise, fluids, are, generally, viscous, a, property, that, is, often, most, important, within, a, boundary, layer, near, a, solid, surface, where, the, flow, must, match, onto, the, no, slip, condition, at, the, solid, in, some, cases, the, mathematics, of, a, fluid, mechanical, system, can, be, treated, by, assuming, that, the, fluid, outside, of, boundary, layers, is, inviscid, and, then, matching, its, solution, onto, that, for, a, thin, laminar, boundary, layer, for, fluid, flow, over, a, porous, boundary, the, fluid, velocity, can, be, discontinuous, between, the, free, fluid, and, the, fluid, in, the, porous, media, this, is, related, to, the, beavers, and, joseph, condition, further, it, is, useful, at, low, subsonic, speeds, to, assume, that, gas, is, incompressible, that, is, the, density, of, the, gas, does, not, change, even, though, the, speed, and, static, pressure, change, a, newtonian, fluid, named, after, isaac, newton, is, defined, to, be, a, fluid, whose, shear, stress, is, linearly, proportional, to, the, velocity, gradient, in, the, direction, perpendicular, to, the, plane, of, shear, this, definition, means, regardless, of, the, forces, acting, on, a, fluid, it, continues, to, flow, for, example, water, is, a, newtonian, fluid, because, it, continues, to, display, fluid, properties, no, matter, how, much, it, is, stirred, or, mixed, a, slightly, less, rigorous, definition, is, that, the, drag, of, a, small, object, being, moved, slowly, through, the, fluid, is, proportional, to, the, force, applied, to, the, object, compare, friction, important, fluids, like, water, as, well, as, most, gasses, behave, to, good, approximation, as, a, newtonian, fluid, under, normal, conditions, on, earth, 145, by, contrast, stirring, a, non, newtonian, fluid, can, leave, a, hole, behind, this, will, gradually, fill, up, over, time, this, behavior, is, seen, in, materials, such, as, pudding, oobleck, or, sand, although, sand, isn, t, strictly, a, fluid, alternatively, stirring, a, non, newtonian, fluid, can, cause, the, viscosity, to, decrease, so, the, fluid, appears, thinner, this, is, seen, in, non, drip, paints, there, are, many, types, of, non, newtonian, fluids, as, they, are, defined, to, be, something, that, fails, to, obey, a, particular, property, for, example, most, fluids, with, long, molecular, chains, can, react, in, a, non, newtonian, manner, 145, the, constant, of, proportionality, between, the, viscous, stress, tensor, and, the, velocity, gradient, is, known, as, the, viscosity, a, simple, equation, to, describe, incompressible, newtonian, fluid, behavior, is, where, for, a, newtonian, fluid, the, viscosity, by, definition, depends, only, on, temperature, not, on, the, forces, acting, upon, it, if, the, fluid, is, incompressible, the, equation, governing, the, viscous, stress, in, cartesian, coordinates, is, where, if, the, fluid, is, not, incompressible, the, general, form, for, the, viscous, stress, in, a, newtonian, fluid, is, where, displaystyle, kappa, is, the, second, viscosity, coefficient, or, bulk, viscosity, if, a, fluid, does, not, obey, this, relation, it, is, termed, a, non, newtonian, fluid, of, which, there, are, several, types, non, newtonian, fluids, can, be, either, plastic, bingham, plastic, pseudoplastic, dilatant, thixotropic, rheopectic, viscoelastic, in, some, applications, another, rough, broad, division, among, fluids, is, made, ideal, and, non, ideal, fluids, an, ideal, fluid, is, non, viscous, and, offers, no, resistance, whatsoever, to, a, shearing, force, an, ideal, fluid, really, does, not, exist, but, in, some, calculations, the, assumption, is, justifiable, one, example, of, this, is, the, flow, far, from, solid, surfaces, in, many, cases, the, viscous, effects, are, concentrated, near, the, solid, boundaries, such, as, in, boundary, layers, while, in, regions, of, the, flow, field, far, away, from, the, boundaries, the, viscous, effects, can, be, neglected, and, the, fluid, there, is, treated, as, it, were, inviscid, ideal, flow, when, the, viscosity, is, neglected, the, term, containing, the, viscous, stress, tensor, displaystyle, mathbf, tau, in, the, navier, stokes, equation, vanishes, the, equation, reduced, in, this, form, is, called, the, euler, equation
