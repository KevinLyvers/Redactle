inorganic, chemistry, deals, with, synthesis, and, behavior, of, inorganic, and, organometallic, compounds, this, field, covers, chemical, compounds, that, are, not, carbon, based, which, are, the, subjects, of, organic, chemistry, the, distinction, between, the, two, disciplines, is, far, from, absolute, as, there, is, much, overlap, in, the, subdiscipline, of, organometallic, chemistry, it, has, applications, in, every, aspect, of, the, chemical, industry, including, catalysis, materials, science, pigments, surfactants, coatings, medications, fuels, and, agriculture, many, inorganic, compounds, are, found, in, nature, as, minerals, soil, may, contain, iron, sulfide, as, pyrite, or, calcium, sulfate, as, gypsum, inorganic, compounds, are, also, found, multitasking, as, biomolecules, as, electrolytes, sodium, chloride, in, energy, storage, atp, or, in, construction, the, polyphosphate, backbone, in, dna, inorganic, compounds, exhibit, a, range, of, bonding, properties, some, are, ionic, compounds, consisting, of, very, simple, cations, and, anions, joined, by, ionic, bonding, examples, of, salts, which, are, ionic, compounds, are, magnesium, chloride, mgcl, 2, which, consists, of, magnesium, cations, mg, 2, and, chloride, anions, cl, or, sodium, hydroxide, naoh, which, consists, of, sodium, cations, na, and, hydroxide, anions, oh, some, inorganic, compounds, are, highly, covalent, such, as, sulfur, dioxide, and, iron, pentacarbonyl, many, inorganic, compounds, feature, polar, covalent, bonding, which, is, a, form, of, bonding, intermediate, between, covalent, and, ionic, bonding, this, description, applies, to, many, oxides, carbonates, and, halides, many, inorganic, compounds, are, characterized, by, high, melting, points, some, salts, e, g, nacl, are, very, soluble, in, water, when, one, reactant, contains, hydrogen, atoms, a, reaction, can, take, place, by, exchanging, protons, in, acid, base, chemistry, in, a, more, general, definition, any, chemical, species, capable, of, binding, to, electron, pairs, is, called, a, lewis, acid, conversely, any, molecule, that, tends, to, donate, an, electron, pair, is, referred, to, as, a, lewis, base, as, a, refinement, of, acid, base, interactions, the, hsab, theory, takes, into, account, polarizability, and, size, of, ions, subdivisions, of, inorganic, chemistry, are, numerous, but, include, inorganic, chemistry, is, a, highly, practical, area, of, science, traditionally, the, scale, of, a, nation, s, economy, could, be, evaluated, by, their, productivity, of, sulfuric, acid, an, important, man, made, inorganic, compound, is, ammonium, nitrate, used, for, fertilization, the, ammonia, is, produced, through, the, haber, process, nitric, acid, is, prepared, from, the, ammonia, by, oxidation, another, large, scale, inorganic, material, is, portland, cement, inorganic, compounds, are, used, as, catalysts, such, as, vanadium, v, oxide, for, the, oxidation, of, sulfur, dioxide, and, titanium, iii, chloride, for, the, polymerization, of, alkenes, many, inorganic, compounds, are, used, as, reagents, in, organic, chemistry, such, as, lithium, aluminium, hydride, descriptive, inorganic, chemistry, focuses, on, the, classification, of, compounds, based, on, their, properties, partly, the, classification, focuses, on, the, position, in, the, periodic, table, of, the, heaviest, element, the, element, with, the, highest, atomic, weight, in, the, compound, partly, by, grouping, compounds, by, their, structural, similarities, classical, coordination, compounds, feature, metals, bound, to, lone, pairs, of, electrons, residing, on, the, main, group, atoms, of, ligands, such, as, h, 2, o, nh, 3, cl, and, cn, in, modern, coordination, compounds, almost, all, organic, and, inorganic, compounds, can, be, used, as, ligands, the, metal, usually, is, a, metal, from, the, groups, 3, 13, as, well, as, the, trans, lanthanides, and, trans, actinides, but, from, a, certain, perspective, all, chemical, compounds, can, be, described, as, coordination, complexes, the, stereochemistry, of, coordination, complexes, can, be, quite, rich, as, hinted, at, by, werner, s, separation, of, two, enantiomers, of, 6, an, early, demonstration, that, chirality, is, not, inherent, to, organic, compounds, a, topical, theme, within, this, specialization, is, supramolecular, coordination, chemistry, coordination, compounds, show, a, rich, diversity, of, structures, varying, from, tetrahedral, for, titanium, e, g, ticl, 4, to, square, planar, for, some, nickel, complexes, to, octahedral, for, coordination, complexes, of, cobalt, a, range, of, transition, metals, can, be, found, in, biologically, important, compounds, such, as, iron, in, hemoglobin, these, species, feature, elements, from, groups, i, ii, iii, iv, v, vi, vii, 0, excluding, hydrogen, of, the, periodic, table, due, to, their, often, similar, reactivity, the, elements, in, group, 3, sc, y, and, la, and, group, 12, zn, cd, and, hg, are, also, generally, included, and, the, lanthanides, and, actinides, are, sometimes, included, as, well, main, group, compounds, have, been, known, since, the, beginnings, of, chemistry, e, g, elemental, sulfur, and, the, distillable, white, phosphorus, experiments, on, oxygen, o, 2, by, lavoisier, and, priestley, not, only, identified, an, important, diatomic, gas, but, opened, the, way, for, describing, compounds, and, reactions, according, to, stoichiometric, ratios, the, discovery, of, a, practical, synthesis, of, ammonia, using, iron, catalysts, by, carl, bosch, and, fritz, haber, in, the, early, 1900s, deeply, impacted, mankind, demonstrating, the, significance, of, inorganic, chemical, synthesis, typical, main, group, compounds, are, sio, 2, sncl, 4, and, n, 2, o, many, main, group, compounds, can, also, be, classed, as, organometallic, as, they, contain, organic, groups, e, g, b, ch, 3, 3, main, group, compounds, also, occur, in, nature, e, g, phosphate, in, dna, and, therefore, may, be, classed, as, bioinorganic, conversely, organic, compounds, lacking, many, hydrogen, ligands, can, be, classed, as, inorganic, such, as, the, fullerenes, buckytubes, and, binary, carbon, oxides, noble, gas, compounds, include, several, derivatives, of, xenon, and, krypton, usually, organometallic, compounds, are, considered, to, contain, the, m, c, h, group, the, metal, m, in, these, species, can, either, be, a, main, group, element, or, a, transition, metal, operationally, the, definition, of, an, organometallic, compound, is, more, relaxed, to, include, also, highly, lipophilic, complexes, such, as, metal, carbonyls, and, even, metal, alkoxides, organometallic, compounds, are, mainly, considered, a, special, category, because, organic, ligands, are, often, sensitive, to, hydrolysis, or, oxidation, necessitating, that, organometallic, chemistry, employs, more, specialized, preparative, methods, than, was, traditional, in, werner, type, complexes, synthetic, methodology, especially, the, ability, to, manipulate, complexes, in, solvents, of, low, coordinating, power, enabled, the, exploration, of, very, weakly, coordinating, ligands, such, as, hydrocarbons, h, 2, and, n, 2, because, the, ligands, are, petrochemicals, in, some, sense, the, area, of, organometallic, chemistry, has, greatly, benefited, from, its, relevance, to, industry, clusters, can, be, found, in, all, classes, of, chemical, compounds, according, to, the, commonly, accepted, definition, a, cluster, consists, minimally, of, a, triangular, set, of, atoms, that, are, directly, bonded, to, each, other, but, metal, metal, bonded, dimetallic, complexes, are, highly, relevant, to, the, area, clusters, occur, in, pure, inorganic, systems, organometallic, chemistry, main, group, chemistry, and, bioinorganic, chemistry, the, distinction, between, very, large, clusters, and, bulk, solids, is, increasingly, blurred, this, interface, is, the, chemical, basis, of, nanoscience, or, nanotechnology, and, specifically, arise, from, the, study, of, quantum, size, effects, in, cadmium, selenide, clusters, thus, large, clusters, can, be, described, as, an, array, of, bound, atoms, intermediate, in, character, between, a, molecule, and, a, solid, by, definition, these, compounds, occur, in, nature, but, the, subfield, includes, anthropogenic, species, such, as, pollutants, e, g, methylmercury, and, drugs, e, g, cisplatin, the, field, which, incorporates, many, aspects, of, biochemistry, includes, many, kinds, of, compounds, e, g, the, phosphates, in, dna, and, also, metal, complexes, containing, ligands, that, range, from, biological, macromolecules, commonly, peptides, to, ill, defined, species, such, as, humic, acid, and, to, water, e, g, coordinated, to, gadolinium, complexes, employed, for, mri, traditionally, bioinorganic, chemistry, focuses, on, electron, and, energy, transfer, in, proteins, relevant, to, respiration, medicinal, inorganic, chemistry, includes, the, study, of, both, non, essential, and, essential, elements, with, applications, to, diagnosis, and, therapies, this, important, area, focuses, on, structure, bonding, and, the, physical, properties, of, materials, in, practice, solid, state, inorganic, chemistry, uses, techniques, such, as, crystallography, to, gain, an, understanding, of, the, properties, that, result, from, collective, interactions, between, the, subunits, of, the, solid, included, in, solid, state, chemistry, are, metals, and, their, alloys, or, intermetallic, derivatives, related, fields, are, condensed, matter, physics, mineralogy, and, materials, science, in, contrast, to, most, organic, compounds, many, inorganic, compounds, are, magnetic, and, or, colored, these, properties, provide, information, on, the, bonding, and, structure, the, magnetism, of, inorganic, compounds, can, be, comlex, for, example, most, copper, ii, compounds, are, paramagnetic, but, cu, ii, 2, oac, 4, h, 2, o, 2, is, almost, diamagnetic, below, room, temperature, the, explanation, is, due, to, magnetic, coupling, between, pairs, of, cu, ii, sites, in, the, acetate, inorganic, chemistry, has, greatly, benefited, from, qualitative, theories, such, theories, are, easier, to, learn, as, they, require, little, background, in, quantum, theory, within, main, group, compounds, vsepr, theory, powerfully, predicts, or, at, least, rationalizes, the, structures, of, main, group, compounds, such, as, an, explanation, for, why, nh, 3, is, pyramidal, whereas, clf, 3, is, t, shaped, for, the, transition, metals, crystal, field, theory, allows, one, to, understand, the, magnetism, of, many, simple, complexes, such, as, why, 3, has, only, one, unpaired, electron, whereas, 3, has, five, a, particularly, powerful, qualitative, approach, to, assessing, the, structure, and, reactivity, begins, with, classifying, molecules, according, to, electron, counting, focusing, on, the, numbers, of, valence, electrons, usually, at, the, central, atom, in, a, molecule, a, construct, in, chemistry, is, molecular, symmetry, as, embodied, in, group, theory, inorganic, compounds, display, a, particularly, diverse, symmetries, so, it, is, logical, that, group, theory, is, intimately, associated, with, inorganic, chemistry, group, theory, provides, the, language, to, describe, the, shapes, of, molecules, according, to, their, point, group, symmetry, group, theory, also, enables, factoring, and, simplification, of, theoretical, calculations, spectroscopic, features, are, analyzed, and, described, with, respect, to, the, symmetry, properties, of, the, inter, alia, vibrational, or, electronic, states, knowledge, of, the, symmetry, properties, of, the, ground, and, excited, states, allows, one, to, predict, the, numbers, and, intensities, of, absorptions, in, vibrational, and, electronic, spectra, a, classic, application, of, group, theory, is, the, prediction, of, the, number, of, c, o, vibrations, in, substituted, metal, carbonyl, complexes, the, most, common, applications, of, symmetry, to, spectroscopy, involve, vibrational, and, electronic, spectra, group, theory, highlights, commonalities, and, differences, in, the, bonding, of, otherwise, disparate, species, for, example, the, metal, based, orbitals, transform, identically, for, wf, 6, and, w, co, 6, but, the, energies, and, populations, of, these, orbitals, differ, significantly, a, similar, relationship, exists, co, 2, and, molecular, beryllium, difluoride, an, alternative, quantitative, approach, to, inorganic, chemistry, focuses, on, energies, of, reactions, this, approach, is, highly, traditional, and, empirical, but, it, is, also, useful, broad, concepts, that, are, couched, in, thermodynamic, terms, include, redox, potential, acidity, phase, changes, a, classic, concept, in, inorganic, thermodynamics, is, the, born, haber, cycle, which, is, used, for, assessing, the, energies, of, elementary, processes, such, as, electron, affinity, some, of, which, cannot, be, observed, directly, an, important, aspect, of, inorganic, chemistry, focuses, on, reaction, pathways, i, e, reaction, mechanisms, the, mechanisms, of, main, group, compounds, of, groups, 13, 18, are, usually, discussed, in, the, context, of, organic, chemistry, organic, compounds, are, main, group, compounds, after, all, elements, heavier, than, c, n, o, and, f, often, form, compounds, with, more, electrons, than, predicted, by, the, octet, rule, as, explained, in, the, article, on, hypervalent, molecules, the, mechanisms, of, their, reactions, differ, from, organic, compounds, for, this, reason, elements, lighter, than, carbon, b, be, li, as, well, as, al, and, mg, often, form, electron, deficient, structures, that, are, electronically, akin, to, carbocations, such, electron, deficient, species, tend, to, react, via, associative, pathways, the, chemistry, of, the, lanthanides, mirrors, many, aspects, of, chemistry, seen, for, aluminium, transition, metal, and, main, group, compounds, often, react, differently, the, important, role, of, d, orbitals, in, bonding, strongly, influences, the, pathways, and, rates, of, ligand, substitution, and, dissociation, these, themes, are, covered, in, articles, on, coordination, chemistry, and, ligand, both, associative, and, dissociative, pathways, are, observed, an, overarching, aspect, of, mechanistic, transition, metal, chemistry, is, the, kinetic, lability, of, the, complex, illustrated, by, the, exchange, of, free, and, bound, water, in, the, prototypical, complexes, n, the, rates, of, water, exchange, varies, by, 20, orders, of, magnitude, across, the, periodic, table, with, lanthanide, complexes, at, one, extreme, and, ir, iii, species, being, the, slowest, redox, reactions, are, prevalent, for, the, transition, elements, two, classes, of, redox, reaction, are, considered, atom, transfer, reactions, such, as, oxidative, addition, reductive, elimination, and, electron, transfer, a, fundamental, redox, reaction, is, self, exchange, which, involves, the, degenerate, reaction, between, an, oxidant, and, a, reductant, for, example, permanganate, and, its, one, electron, reduced, relative, manganate, exchange, one, electron, coordinated, ligands, display, reactivity, distinct, from, the, free, ligands, for, example, the, acidity, of, the, ammonia, ligands, in, 3, is, elevated, relative, to, nh, 3, itself, alkenes, bound, to, metal, cations, are, reactive, toward, nucleophiles, whereas, alkenes, normally, are, not, the, large, and, industrially, important, area, of, catalysis, hinges, on, the, ability, of, metals, to, modify, the, reactivity, of, organic, ligands, homogeneous, catalysis, occurs, in, solution, and, heterogeneous, catalysis, occurs, when, gaseous, or, dissolved, substrates, interact, with, surfaces, of, solids, traditionally, homogeneous, catalysis, is, considered, part, of, organometallic, chemistry, and, heterogeneous, catalysis, is, discussed, in, the, context, of, surface, science, a, subfield, of, solid, state, chemistry, but, the, basic, inorganic, chemical, principles, are, the, same, transition, metals, almost, uniquely, react, with, small, molecules, such, as, co, h, 2, o, 2, and, c, 2, h, 4, the, industrial, significance, of, these, feedstocks, drives, the, active, area, of, catalysis, ligands, can, also, undergo, ligand, transfer, reactions, such, as, transmetalation, because, of, the, diverse, range, of, elements, and, the, correspondingly, diverse, properties, of, the, resulting, derivatives, inorganic, chemistry, is, closely, associated, with, many, methods, of, analysis, older, methods, tended, to, examine, bulk, properties, such, as, the, electrical, conductivity, of, solutions, melting, points, solubility, and, acidity, with, the, advent, of, quantum, theory, and, the, corresponding, expansion, of, electronic, apparatus, new, tools, have, been, introduced, to, probe, the, electronic, properties, of, inorganic, molecules, and, solids, often, these, measurements, provide, insights, relevant, to, theoretical, models, commonly, encountered, techniques, are, although, some, inorganic, species, can, be, obtained, in, pure, form, from, nature, most, are, synthesized, in, chemical, plants, and, in, the, laboratory, inorganic, synthetic, methods, can, be, classified, roughly, according, to, the, volatility, or, solubility, of, the, component, reactants, soluble, inorganic, compounds, are, prepared, using, methods, of, organic, synthesis, for, metal, containing, compounds, that, are, reactive, toward, air, schlenk, line, and, glove, box, techniques, are, followed, volatile, compounds, and, gases, are, manipulated, in, vacuum, manifolds, consisting, of, glass, piping, interconnected, through, valves, the, entirety, of, which, can, be, evacuated, to, 0, 001, mm, hg, or, less, compounds, are, condensed, using, liquid, nitrogen, b, p, 78k, or, other, cryogens, solids, are, typically, prepared, using, tube, furnaces, the, reactants, and, products, being, sealed, in, containers, often, made, of, fused, silica, amorphous, sio, 2, but, sometimes, more, specialized, materials, such, as, welded, ta, tubes, or, pt, boats, products, and, reactants, are, transported, between, temperature, zones, to, drive, reactions
