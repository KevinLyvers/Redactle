the, becquerel, b, k, r, l, symbol, bq, is, the, unit, of, radioactivity, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, one, becquerel, is, defined, as, an, activity, of, one, decay, per, second, for, applications, relating, to, human, health, this, is, a, small, quantity, and, si, multiples, of, the, unit, are, commonly, used, the, becquerel, is, named, after, henri, becquerel, who, shared, a, nobel, prize, in, physics, with, pierre, and, marie, curie, in, 1903, for, their, work, in, discovering, radioactivity, 1, bq, 1, s, 1, a, special, name, was, introduced, for, the, reciprocal, second, s, 1, to, represent, radioactivity, to, avoid, potentially, dangerous, mistakes, with, prefixes, for, example, 1, s, 1, would, mean, 10, 6, disintegrations, per, second, 10, 6, s, 1, 10, 6, s, 1, whereas, 1, bq, would, mean, 1, disintegration, per, 1, million, seconds, other, names, considered, were, hertz, hz, a, special, name, already, in, use, for, the, reciprocal, second, and, fourier, fr, after, joseph, fourier, the, hertz, is, now, only, used, for, periodic, phenomena, while, 1, hz, refers, to, one, cycle, per, second, 1, bq, refers, to, one, event, per, second, on, average, for, aperiodic, radioactive, decays, the, gray, gy, and, the, becquerel, bq, were, introduced, in, 1975, between, 1953, and, 1975, absorbed, dose, was, often, measured, with, the, rad, decay, activity, was, given, with, the, curie, before, 1946, and, often, with, the, rutherford, between, 1946, and, 1975, as, with, every, international, system, of, units, si, unit, named, after, a, person, the, first, letter, of, its, symbol, is, uppercase, bq, however, when, an, si, unit, is, spelled, out, in, english, it, should, always, begin, with, a, lowercase, letter, becquerel, except, in, a, situation, where, any, word, in, that, position, would, be, capitalized, such, as, at, the, beginning, of, a, sentence, or, in, material, using, title, case, like, any, si, unit, bq, can, be, prefixed, commonly, used, multiples, are, kbq, kilobecquerel, 10, 3, bq, mbq, megabecquerel, 10, 6, bq, equivalent, to, 1, rutherford, gbq, gigabecquerel, 10, 9, bq, tbq, terabecquerel, 10, 12, bq, and, pbq, petabecquerel, 10, 15, bq, large, prefixes, are, common, for, practical, uses, of, the, unit, for, practical, applications, 1, bq, is, a, small, unit, for, example, there, is, roughly, 0, 017, g, of, potassium, 40, in, a, typical, human, body, producing, about, 4, 400, decays, per, second, bq, the, activity, of, radioactive, americium, in, a, home, smoke, detector, is, about, 37, kbq, 1, ci, the, global, inventory, of, carbon, 14, is, estimated, to, be, 8, 5, 10, 18, bq, 8, 5, ebq, 8, 5, exabecquerel, these, examples, are, useful, for, comparing, the, amount, of, activity, of, these, radioactive, materials, but, should, not, be, confused, with, the, amount, of, exposure, to, ionizing, radiation, that, these, materials, represent, the, level, of, exposure, and, thus, the, absorbed, dose, received, are, what, should, be, considered, when, assessing, the, effects, of, ionizing, radiation, on, humans, the, becquerel, succeeded, the, curie, ci, an, older, non, si, unit, of, radioactivity, based, on, the, activity, of, 1, gram, of, radium, 226, the, curie, is, defined, as, 3, 7, 10, 10, s, 1, or, 37, gbq, conversion, factors, the, following, table, shows, radiation, quantities, in, si, and, non, si, units, w, r, formerly, q, factor, is, a, factor, that, scales, the, biological, effect, for, different, types, of, radiation, relative, to, x, rays, e, g, 1, for, beta, radiation, 20, for, alpha, radiation, and, a, complicated, function, of, energy, for, neutrons, in, general, conversion, between, rates, of, emission, the, density, of, radiation, the, fraction, absorbed, and, the, biological, effects, requires, knowledge, of, the, geometry, between, source, and, target, the, energy, and, the, type, of, the, radiation, emitted, among, other, factors
