hydrogen, peroxide, is, a, chemical, compound, with, the, formula, h, 2, o, 2, in, its, pure, form, it, is, a, very, pale, blue, liquid, that, is, slightly, more, viscous, than, water, it, is, used, as, an, oxidizer, bleaching, agent, and, antiseptic, usually, as, a, dilute, solution, 3, 6, by, weight, in, water, for, consumer, use, and, in, higher, concentrations, for, industrial, use, concentrated, hydrogen, peroxide, or, high, test, peroxide, decomposes, explosively, when, heated, and, has, been, used, as, both, a, monopropellant, and, an, oxidizer, in, rocketry, hydrogen, peroxide, is, a, reactive, oxygen, species, and, the, simplest, peroxide, a, compound, having, an, oxygen, oxygen, single, bond, it, decomposes, slowly, into, water, and, elemental, oxygen, when, exposed, to, light, and, rapidly, in, the, presence, of, organic, or, reactive, compounds, it, is, typically, stored, with, a, stabilizer, in, a, weakly, acidic, solution, in, an, opaque, bottle, hydrogen, peroxide, is, found, in, biological, systems, including, the, human, body, enzymes, that, use, or, decompose, hydrogen, peroxide, are, classified, as, peroxidases, the, boiling, point, of, h, 2, o, 2, has, been, extrapolated, as, being, 150, 2, c, 302, 4, f, approximately, 50, c, 90, f, higher, than, water, in, practice, hydrogen, peroxide, will, undergo, potentially, explosive, thermal, decomposition, if, heated, to, this, temperature, it, may, be, safely, distilled, at, lower, temperatures, under, reduced, pressure, hydrogen, peroxide, forms, stable, adducts, with, urea, hydrogen, peroxide, urea, sodium, carbonate, sodium, percarbonate, and, other, compounds, an, acid, base, adduct, with, triphenylphosphine, oxide, is, a, useful, carrier, for, h, 2, o, 2, in, some, reactions, hydrogen, peroxide, h, 2, o, 2, is, a, nonplanar, molecule, with, twisted, c, 2, symmetry, this, was, first, shown, by, paul, antoine, gigu, re, in, 1950, using, infrared, spectroscopy, although, the, o, o, bond, is, a, single, bond, the, molecule, has, a, relatively, high, rotational, barrier, of, 386, cm, 1, 4, 62, kj, mol, for, rotation, between, enantiomers, via, the, trans, configuration, and, 2460, cm, 1, 29, 4, kj, mol, via, the, cis, configuration, these, barriers, are, proposed, to, be, due, to, repulsion, between, the, lone, pairs, of, the, adjacent, oxygen, atoms, and, dipolar, effects, between, the, two, o, h, bonds, for, comparison, the, rotational, barrier, for, ethane, is, 1040, cm, 1, 12, 4, kj, mol, the, approximately, 100, dihedral, angle, between, the, two, o, h, bonds, makes, the, molecule, chiral, it, is, the, smallest, and, simplest, molecule, to, exhibit, enantiomerism, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, enantiospecific, interactions, of, one, rather, than, the, other, may, have, led, to, amplification, of, one, enantiomeric, form, of, ribonucleic, acids, and, therefore, an, origin, of, homochirality, in, an, rna, world, the, molecular, structures, of, gaseous, and, crystalline, h, 2, o, 2, are, significantly, different, this, difference, is, attributed, to, the, effects, of, hydrogen, bonding, which, is, absent, in, the, gaseous, state, crystals, of, h, 2, o, 2, are, tetragonal, with, the, space, group, d, 4, 4, or, p, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, in, aqueous, solutions, hydrogen, peroxide, forms, a, eutectic, mixture, exhibiting, freezing, point, depression, down, as, low, as, 56, c, pure, water, has, a, freezing, point, of, 0, c, and, pure, hydrogen, peroxide, of, 0, 43, c, the, boiling, point, of, the, same, mixtures, is, also, depressed, in, relation, with, the, mean, of, both, boiling, points, 125, 1, c, it, occurs, at, 114, c, this, boiling, point, is, 14, c, greater, than, that, of, pure, water, and, 36, 2, c, less, than, that, of, pure, hydrogen, peroxide, hydrogen, peroxide, is, most, commonly, available, as, a, solution, in, water, for, consumers, it, is, usually, available, from, pharmacies, at, 3, and, 6, wt, concentrations, the, concentrations, are, sometimes, described, in, terms, of, the, volume, of, oxygen, gas, generated, one, milliliter, of, a, 20, volume, solution, generates, twenty, milliliters, of, oxygen, gas, when, completely, decomposed, for, laboratory, use, 30, wt, solutions, are, most, common, commercial, grades, from, 70, to, 98, are, also, available, but, due, to, the, potential, of, solutions, of, more, than, 68, hydrogen, peroxide, to, be, converted, entirely, to, steam, and, oxygen, with, the, temperature, of, the, steam, increasing, as, the, concentration, increases, above, 68, these, grades, are, potentially, far, more, hazardous, and, require, special, care, in, dedicated, storage, areas, buyers, must, typically, allow, inspection, by, commercial, manufacturers, hydrogen, peroxide, has, several, structural, analogues, with, h, m, x, xh, n, bonding, arrangements, water, also, shown, for, comparison, it, has, the, highest, theoretical, boiling, point, of, this, series, x, o, s, n, p, its, melting, point, is, also, fairly, high, being, comparable, to, that, of, hydrazine, and, water, with, only, hydroxylamine, crystallising, significantly, more, readily, indicative, of, particularly, strong, hydrogen, bonding, diphosphane, and, hydrogen, disulfide, exhibit, only, weak, hydrogen, bonding, and, have, little, chemical, similarity, to, hydrogen, peroxide, structurally, the, analogues, all, adopt, similar, skewed, structures, due, to, repulsion, between, adjacent, lone, pairs, hydrogen, peroxide, is, produced, by, various, biological, processes, mediated, by, enzymes, hydrogen, peroxide, has, been, detected, in, surface, water, in, groundwater, and, in, the, atmosphere, it, can, also, form, when, water, is, exposed, to, uv, light, sea, water, contains, 0, 5, to, 14, g, l, of, hydrogen, peroxide, and, freshwater, contains, 1, to, 30, g, l, concentrations, in, air, are, about, 0, 4, to, 4, g, m, 3, varying, over, several, orders, of, magnitude, depending, in, conditions, such, as, season, altitude, daylight, and, water, vapor, content, in, rural, nighttime, air, it, is, less, than, 0, 014, g, m, 3, and, in, moderate, photochemical, smog, it, is, 14, to, 42, g, m, 3, the, amount, of, hydrogen, peroxide, in, biological, systems, can, be, assayed, using, a, fluorometric, assay, alexander, von, humboldt, is, sometimes, said, to, have, been, the, first, to, report, the, first, synthetic, peroxide, barium, peroxide, in, 1799, as, a, by, product, of, his, attempts, to, decompose, air, although, this, is, disputed, due, to, von, humboldt, s, ambiguous, wording, nineteen, years, later, louis, jacques, th, nard, recognized, that, this, compound, could, be, used, for, the, preparation, of, a, previously, unknown, compound, which, he, described, as, eau, oxyg, n, e, oxygenated, water, subsequently, known, as, hydrogen, peroxide, an, improved, version, of, th, nard, s, process, used, hydrochloric, acid, followed, by, addition, of, sulfuric, acid, to, precipitate, the, barium, sulfate, byproduct, this, process, was, used, from, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, until, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, the, bleaching, effect, of, peroxides, and, their, salts, on, natural, dyes, had, been, known, since, th, nard, s, experiments, in, the, 1820s, but, early, attempts, of, industrial, production, of, peroxides, failed, the, first, plant, producing, hydrogen, peroxide, was, built, in, 1873, in, berlin, the, discovery, of, the, synthesis, of, hydrogen, peroxide, by, electrolysis, with, sulfuric, acid, introduced, the, more, efficient, electrochemical, method, it, was, first, commercialized, in, 1908, in, wei, enstein, carinthia, austria, the, anthraquinone, process, which, is, still, used, was, developed, during, the, 1930s, by, the, german, chemical, manufacturer, ig, farben, in, ludwigshafen, the, increased, demand, and, improvements, in, the, synthesis, methods, resulted, in, the, rise, of, the, annual, production, of, hydrogen, peroxide, from, 35, 000, tonnes, in, 1950, to, over, 100, 000, tonnes, in, 1960, to, 300, 000, tonnes, by, 1970, by, 1998, it, reached, 2, 7, million, tonnes, early, attempts, failed, to, produce, neat, hydrogen, peroxide, anhydrous, hydrogen, peroxide, was, first, obtained, by, vacuum, distillation, determination, of, the, molecular, structure, of, hydrogen, peroxide, proved, to, be, very, difficult, in, 1892, the, italian, physical, chemist, giacomo, carrara, 1864, 1925, determined, its, molecular, mass, by, freezing, point, depression, which, confirmed, that, its, molecular, formula, is, h, 2, o, 2, h, 2, o, o, seemed, to, be, just, as, possible, as, the, modern, structure, and, as, late, as, in, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, at, least, half, a, dozen, hypothetical, isomeric, variants, of, two, main, options, seemed, to, be, consistent, with, the, available, evidence, in, 1934, the, english, mathematical, physicist, william, penney, and, the, scottish, physicist, gordon, sutherland, proposed, a, molecular, structure, for, hydrogen, peroxide, that, was, very, similar, to, the, presently, accepted, one, in, 1994, world, production, of, h, 2, o, 2, was, around, 1, 9, million, tonnes, and, grew, to, 2, 2, million, in, 2006, most, of, which, was, at, a, concentration, of, 70, or, less, in, that, year, bulk, 30, h, 2, o, 2, sold, for, around, 0, 54, usd, kg, equivalent, to, us, 1, 50, kg, us, 0, 68, lb, on, a, 100, basis, today, hydrogen, peroxide, is, manufactured, almost, exclusively, by, the, anthraquinone, process, which, was, originally, developed, by, basf, in, 1939, it, begins, with, the, reduction, of, an, anthraquinone, such, as, 2, ethylanthraquinone, or, the, 2, amyl, derivative, to, the, corresponding, anthrahydroquinone, typically, by, hydrogenation, on, a, palladium, catalyst, in, the, presence, of, oxygen, the, anthrahydroquinone, then, undergoes, autoxidation, the, labile, hydrogen, atoms, of, the, hydroxy, groups, transfer, to, the, oxygen, molecule, to, give, hydrogen, peroxide, and, regenerating, the, anthraquinone, most, commercial, processes, achieve, oxidation, by, bubbling, compressed, air, through, a, solution, of, the, anthrahydroquinone, with, the, hydrogen, peroxide, then, extracted, from, the, solution, and, the, anthraquinone, recycled, back, for, successive, cycles, of, hydrogenation, and, oxidation, the, net, reaction, for, the, anthraquinone, catalyzed, process, is, the, economics, of, the, process, depend, heavily, on, effective, recycling, of, the, extraction, solvents, the, hydrogenation, catalyst, and, the, expensive, quinone, hydrogen, peroxide, was, once, prepared, industrially, by, hydrolysis, of, ammonium, persulfate, 2, s, 2, o, 8, was, itself, obtained, by, the, electrolysis, of, a, solution, of, ammonium, bisulfate, hso, 4, in, sulfuric, acid, small, amounts, are, formed, by, electrolysis, photochemistry, and, electric, arc, and, related, methods, a, commercially, viable, route, for, hydrogen, peroxide, via, the, reaction, of, hydrogen, with, oxygen, favours, production, of, water, but, can, be, stopped, at, the, peroxide, stage, one, economic, obstacle, has, been, that, direct, processes, give, a, dilute, solution, uneconomic, for, transportation, none, of, these, has, yet, reached, a, point, where, it, can, be, used, for, industrial, scale, synthesis, hydrogen, peroxide, is, about, 1000, times, stronger, as, an, acid, than, water, hydrogen, peroxide, disproportionates, to, form, water, and, oxygen, with, a, h, o, of, 2884, 5, kj, kg, and, a, s, of, 70, 5, j, mol, k, the, rate, of, decomposition, increases, with, rise, in, temperature, concentration, and, ph, h, 2, o, 2, is, unstable, under, alkaline, conditions, decomposition, is, catalysed, by, various, redox, active, ions, or, compounds, including, most, transition, metals, and, their, compounds, e, g, manganese, dioxide, mno, 2, silver, and, platinum, the, redox, properties, of, hydrogen, peroxide, depend, on, ph, in, acidic, solutions, h, 2, o, 2, is, a, powerful, oxidizer, sulfite, so, 2, 3, is, oxidized, to, sulfate, so, 2, 4, under, alkaline, conditions, hydrogen, peroxide, is, a, reductant, when, h, 2, o, 2, acts, as, a, reducing, agent, oxygen, gas, is, also, produced, for, example, hydrogen, peroxide, will, reduce, sodium, hypochlorite, and, potassium, permanganate, which, is, a, convenient, method, for, preparing, oxygen, in, the, laboratory, the, oxygen, produced, from, hydrogen, peroxide, and, sodium, hypochlorite, is, in, the, singlet, state, hydrogen, peroxide, also, reduces, silver, oxide, to, silver, although, usually, a, reductant, alkaline, hydrogen, peroxide, converts, mn, ii, to, the, dioxide, in, a, related, reaction, potassium, permanganate, is, reduced, to, mn, 2, by, acidic, h, 2, o, 2, hydrogen, peroxide, is, frequently, used, as, an, oxidizing, agent, illustrative, is, oxidation, of, thioethers, to, sulfoxides, alkaline, hydrogen, peroxide, is, used, for, epoxidation, of, electron, deficient, alkenes, such, as, acrylic, acid, derivatives, and, for, the, oxidation, of, alkylboranes, to, alcohols, the, second, step, of, hydroboration, oxidation, it, is, also, the, principal, reagent, in, the, dakin, oxidation, process, hydrogen, peroxide, is, a, weak, acid, forming, hydroperoxide, or, peroxide, salts, with, many, metals, it, also, converts, metal, oxides, into, the, corresponding, peroxides, for, example, upon, treatment, with, hydrogen, peroxide, chromic, acid, cro, 3, and, h, 2, so, 4, forms, a, blue, peroxide, cro, o, 2, 2, the, aerobic, oxidation, of, glucose, in, the, presence, of, the, enzyme,

in, s, process, catalyzed, by, flavin, adenine, dinucleotide, fad, hydrogen, peroxide, arises, by, the, degradation, of, adenosine, monophosphate, which, yields, hypoxanthine, hypoxanthine, is, then, oxidatively, catabolized, first, to, xanthine, and, then, to, uric, acid, and, the, reaction, is, catalyzed, by, the, enzyme, xanthine, oxidase, hypoxanthine, xanthine, oxidase, xanthine, xanthine, oxidase, uric, acid, the, degradation, of, guanosine, monophosphate, yields, xanthine, as, an, intermediate, product, which, is, then, converted, in, the, same, way, to, uric, acid, with, the, formation, of, hydrogen, peroxide, catalase, another, peroxisomal, enzyme, uses, this, h, 2, o, 2, to, oxidize, other, substrates, including, phenols, formic, acid, formaldehyde, and, alcohol, by, means, of, a, peroxidation, reaction, thus, eliminating, the, poisonous, hydrogen, peroxide, in, the, process, this, reaction, is, important, in, liver, and, kidney, cells, where, the, peroxisomes, neutralize, various, toxic, substances, that, enter, the, blood, some, of, the, ethanol, humans, drink, is, oxidized, to, acetaldehyde, in, this, way, in, addition, when, excess, h, 2, o, 2, accumulates, in, the, cell, catalase, converts, it, to, h, 2, o, through, this, reaction, glutathione, peroxidase, a, selenoenzyme, also, catalyzes, the, disproportionation, of, hydrogen, peroxide, the, reaction, of, fe, 2, and, hydrogen, peroxide, is, the, basis, of, the, fenton, reaction, which, generates, hydroxyl, radicals, which, are, of, significance, in, biology, the, fenton, reaction, explains, the, toxicity, of, hydrogen, peroxides, because, the, hydroxyl, radicals, rapidly, and, irreversibly, oxidize, all, organic, compounds, including, proteins, membrane, lipids, and, dna, hydrogen, peroxide, is, a, significant, source, of, oxidative, dna, damage, in, living, cells, dna, damage, includes, formation, of, 8, oxo, 2, deoxyguanosine, among, many, other, altered, bases, as,

and, plaque, although, there, is, a, positive, effect, when, compared, with, a, placebo, it, was, concluded, that, chlorhexidine, is, a, much, more, effective, treatment, some, horticulturists, and, users, of, hydroponics, advocate, the, use, of, weak, hydrogen, peroxide, solution, in, watering, solutions, its, spontaneous, decomposition, releases, oxygen, that, enhances, a, plant, s, root, development, and, helps, to, treat, root, rot, cellular, root, death, due, to, lack, of, oxygen, and, a, variety, of, other, pests, for, general, watering, concentrations, around, 0, 1, is, in, use, this, can, be, increased, up, to, one, percent, for, antifungal, actions, tests, show, that, plant, foliage, can, safely, tolerate, concentrations, up, to, 3, hydrogen, peroxide, is, used, in, aquaculture, for, controlling, mortality, caused, by, various, microbes, in, 2019, the, u, s, fda, approved, it, for, control, of, saprolegniasis, in, all, coldwater, finfish, and, all, fingerling, and, adult, coolwater, and, warmwater, finfish, for, control, of, external, columnaris, disease, in, warm, water, finfish, and, for, control, of, gyrodactylus, spp, in, freshwater, reared, salmonids, laboratory, tests, conducted, by, fish, culturists, have, demonstrated, that, common, household, hydrogen, peroxide, may, be, used, safely, to, provide, oxygen, for, small, fish, the, hydrogen, peroxide, releases, oxygen, by, decomposition, when, it, is, exposed, to, catalysts, such, as, manganese, dioxide, hydrogen, peroxide, may, be, used, in, combination, with, a, uv, light, source, to, remove, yellowing, from, white, or, light, grey, acrylonitrile, butadiene, styrene, abs, plastics, to, partially, or, fully, restore, the, original, color, in, the, retrocomputing, scene, this, process, is, commonly, referred, to, as, retrobright, regulations, vary, but, low, concentrations, such, as, 5, are, widely, available, and, legal, to, buy, for, medical, use, most, over, the, counter, peroxide, solutions, are, not, suitable, for, ingestion, higher, concentrations, may, be, considered, hazardous, and, typically, are, accompanied, by, a, safety, data, sheet, sds, in, high, concentrations, hydrogen, peroxide, is, an, aggressive, oxidizer, and, will, corrode, many, materials, including, human, skin, in, the, presence, of, a, reducing, agent, high, concentrations, of, h, 2, o, 2, will, react, violently, while, concentrations, up, to, 35, produce, only, white, oxygen, bubbles, in, the, skin, and, some, biting, pain, that, disappear, with, the, blood, within, 30, 45, minutes, concentrations, of, 98, dissolve, paper, however, concentrations, as, low, as, 3, can, be, dangerous, for, the, eye, because, of, oxygen, evolution, within, the, eye, high, concentration, hydrogen, peroxide, streams, typically, above, 40, should, be, considered, hazardous, due, to, concentrated, hydrogen, peroxide, s, meeting, the, definition, of, a, dot, oxidizer, according, to, u, s, regulations, if, released, into, the, environment, the, epa, reportable, quantity, rq, for, d001, hazardous, wastes, is, 100, pounds, 45, kg, or, approximately, 10, us, gallons, 38, l, of, concentrated, hydrogen, peroxide, hydrogen, peroxide, should, be, stored, in, a, cool, dry, well, ventilated, area, and, away, from, any, flammable, or, combustible, substances, it, should, be, stored, in, a, container, composed, of, non, reactive, materials, such, as, stainless, steel, or, glass, other, materials, including, some, plastics, and, aluminium, alloys, may, also, be, suitable, because, it, breaks, down, quickly, when, exposed, to, light, it, should, be, stored, in, an, opaque, container, and, pharmaceutical, formulations, typically, come, in, brown, bottles, that, block, light, hydrogen, peroxide, either, in, pure, or, diluted, form, may, pose, several, risks, the, main, one, being, that, it, forms, explosive, mixtures, upon, contact, with, organic, compounds, distillation, of, hydrogen, peroxide, at, normal, pressures, is, highly, dangerous, it, is, also, corrosive, especially, when, concentrated, but, even, domestic, strength, solutions, may, cause, irritation, to, the, eyes, mucous, membranes, and, skin, swallowing, hydrogen, peroxide, solutions, is, particularly, dangerous, as, decomposition, in, the, stomach, releases, large, quantities, of, gas, ten, times, the, volume, of, a, 3, solution, leading, to, internal, bloating, inhaling, over, 10, can, cause, severe, pulmonary, irritation, with, a, significant, vapour, pressure, 1, 2, kpa, at, 50, c, hydrogen, peroxide, vapour, is, potentially, hazardous, according, to, u, s, niosh, the, immediately, dangerous, to, life, and, health, idlh, limit, is, only, 75, ppm, the, u, s, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, has, established, a, permissible, exposure, limit, of, 1, 0, ppm, calculated, as, an, 8, hour, time, weighted, average, 29, cfr, 1910, 1000, table, z, 1, hydrogen, peroxide, also, has, been, classified, by, the, american, conference, of, governmental, industrial, hygienists, acgih, as, a, known, animal, carcinogen, with, unknown, relevance, on, humans, for, workplaces, where, there, is, a, risk, of, exposure, to, the, hazardous, concentrations, of, the, vapours, continuous, monitors, for, hydrogen, peroxide, should, be, used, information, on, the, hazards, of, hydrogen, peroxide, is, available, from, osha, and, from, the, atsdr, historically, hydrogen, peroxide, was, used, for, disinfecting, wounds, partly, because, of, its, low, cost, and, prompt, availability, compared, to, other, antiseptics, there, is, conflicting, evidence, on, hydrogen, peroxide, s, effect, on, wound, healing, some, research, finds, benefit, while, other, research, find, delays, and, healing, inhibition, its, use, for, home, treatment, of, wounds, is, generally, not, recommended, 1, 5, 3, hydrogen, peroxide, is, used, as, a, disinfectant, in, dentistry, especially, in, endodotic, treatments, together, with, hypochlorite, and, chlorhexidin, and, 1, 1, 5, is, also, useful, for, treatment, of, inflammation, of, third, molars, wisdom, teeth, practitioners, of, alternative, medicine, have, advocated, the, use, of, hydrogen, peroxide, for, various, conditions, including, emphysema, influenza, aids, and, in, particular, cancer, there, is, no, evidence, of, effectiveness, and, in, some, cases, it, has, proved, fatal, both, the, effectiveness, and, safety, of, hydrogen, peroxide, therapy, is, scientifically, questionable, hydrogen, peroxide, is, produced, by, the, immune, system, but, in, a, carefully, controlled, manner, cells, called, phagocytes, engulf, pathogens, and, then, use, hydrogen, peroxide, to, destroy, them, the, peroxide, is, toxic, to, both, the, cell, and, the, pathogen, and, so, is, kept, within, a, special, compartment, called, a, phagosome, free, hydrogen, peroxide, will, damage, any, tissue, it, encounters, via, oxidative, stress, a, process, that, also, has, been, proposed, as, a, cause, of, cancer, claims, that, hydrogen, peroxide, therapy, increases, cellular, levels, of, oxygen, have, not, been, supported, the, quantities, administered, would, be, expected, to, provide, very, little, additional, oxygen, compared, to, that, available, from, normal, respiration, it, is, also, difficult, to, raise, the, level, of, oxygen, around, cancer, cells, within, a, tumour, as, the, blood, supply, tends, to, be, poor, a, situation, known, as, tumor, hypoxia, large, oral, doses, of, hydrogen, peroxide, at, a, 3, concentration, may, cause, irritation, and, blistering, to, the, mouth, throat, and, abdomen, as, well, as, abdominal, pain, vomiting, and, diarrhea, ingestion, of, hydrogen, peroxide, at, concentrations, of, 35, or, higher, has, been, implicated, as, the, cause, of, numerous, gas, embolism, events, resulting, in, hospitalisation, in, these, cases, hyperbaric, oxygen, therapy, was, used, to, treat, the, embolisms, intravenous, injection, of, hydrogen, peroxide, has, been, linked, to, several, deaths, the, american, cancer, society, states, that, there, is, no, scientific, evidence, that, hydrogen, peroxide, is, a, safe, effective, or, useful, cancer, treatment, furthermore, the, therapy, is, not, approved, by, the, u, s, fda, bibliography
