boron, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, the, symbol, b, and, atomic, number, 5, in, its, crystalline, form, it, is, a, brittle, dark, lustrous, metalloid, in, its, amorphous, form, it, is, a, brown, powder, as, the, lightest, element, of, the, boron, group, it, has, three, valence, electrons, for, forming, covalent, bonds, resulting, in, many, compounds, such, as, boric, acid, the, mineral, sodium, borate, and, the, ultra, hard, crystals, of, boron, carbide, and, boron, nitride, boron, is, synthesized, entirely, by, cosmic, ray, spallation, and, supernovas, and, not, by, stellar, nucleosynthesis, so, it, is, a, low, abundance, element, in, the, solar, system, and, in, the, earth, s, crust, it, constitutes, about, 0, 001, percent, by, weight, of, earth, s, crust, it, is, concentrated, on, earth, by, the, water, solubility, of, its, more, common, naturally, occurring, compounds, the, borate, minerals, these, are, mined, industrially, as, evaporites, such, as, borax, and, kernite, the, largest, known, deposits, are, in, turkey, the, largest, producer, of, boron, minerals, elemental, boron, is, a, metalloid, that, is, found, in, small, amounts, in, meteoroids, but, chemically, uncombined, boron, is, not, otherwise, found, naturally, on, earth, industrially, the, very, pure, element, is, produced, with, difficulty, because, of, contamination, by, carbon, or, other, elements, that, resist, removal, several, allotropes, exist, amorphous, boron, is, a, brown, powder, crystalline, boron, is, silvery, to, black, extremely, hard, 9, 3, on, the, mohs, scale, and, a, poor, electrical, conductor, at, room, temperature, 1, 5, 10, 6, 1, cm, 1, room, temperature, electrical, conductivity, the, primary, use, of, the, element, itself, is, as, boron, filaments, with, applications, similar, to, carbon, fibers, in, some, high, strength, materials, boron, is, primarily, used, in, chemical, compounds, about, half, of, all, production, consumed, globally, is, an, additive, in, fiberglass, for, insulation, and, structural, materials, the, next, leading, use, is, in, polymers, and, ceramics, in, high, strength, lightweight, structural, and, heat, resistant, materials, borosilicate, glass, is, desired, for, its, greater, strength, and, thermal, shock, resistance, than, ordinary, soda, lime, glass, as, sodium, perborate, it, is, used, as, a, bleach, a, small, amount, is, used, as, a, dopant, in, semiconductors, and, reagent, intermediates, in, the, synthesis, of, organic, fine, chemicals, a, few, boron, containing, organic, pharmaceuticals, are, used, or, are, in, study, natural, boron, is, composed, of, two, stable, isotopes, one, of, which, boron, 10, has, a, number, of, uses, as, a, neutron, capturing, agent, the, intersection, of, boron, with, biology, is, very, small, consensus, on, it, as, essential, for, mammalian, life, is, lacking, borates, have, low, toxicity, in, mammals, similar, to, table, salt, but, are, more, toxic, to, arthropods, and, are, occasionally, used, as, insecticides, boron, containing, organic, antibiotics, are, known, although, only, traces, are, required, it, is, an, essential, plant, nutrient, the, word, boron, was, coined, from, borax, the, mineral, from, which, it, was, isolated, by, analogy, with, carbon, which, boron, resembles, chemically, borax, in, its, mineral, form, then, known, as, tincal, first, saw, use, as, a, glaze, beginning, in, china, circa, 300, ad, some, crude, borax, traveled, westward, and, was, apparently, mentioned, by, the, alchemist, jabir, ibn, hayyan, around, 700, ad, marco, polo, brought, some, glazes, back, to, italy, in, the, 13th, century, georgius, agricola, in, around, 1600, reported, the, use, of, borax, as, a, flux, in, metallurgy, in, 1777, boric, acid, was, recognized, in, the, hot, springs, soffioni, near, florence, italy, at, which, point, it, became, known, as, sal, sedativum, with, ostensible, medical, benefits, the, mineral, was, named, sassolite, after, sasso, pisano, in, italy, sasso, was, the, main, source, of, european, borax, from, 1827, to, 1872, when, american, sources, replaced, it, boron, compounds, were, relatively, rarely, used, until, the, late, 1800s, when, francis, marion, smith, s, pacific, coast, borax, company, first, popularized, and, produced, them, in, volume, at, low, cost, boron, was, not, recognized, as, an, element, until, it, was, isolated, by, sir, humphry, davy, and, by, joseph, louis, gay, lussac, and, louis, jacques, th, nard, in, 1808, davy, observed, that, electric, current, sent, through, a, solution, of, borates, produced, a, brown, precipitate, on, one, of, the, electrodes, in, his, subsequent, experiments, he, used, potassium, to, reduce, boric, acid, instead, of, electrolysis, he, produced, enough, boron, to, confirm, a, new, element, and, named, it, boracium, gay, lussac, and, th, nard, used, iron, to, reduce, boric, acid, at, high, temperatures, by, oxidizing, boron, with, air, they, showed, that, boric, acid, is, its, oxidation, product, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, identified, it, as, an, element, in, 1824, pure, boron, was, arguably, first, produced, by, the, american, chemist, ezekiel, weintraub, in, 1909, some, early, routes, to, elemental, boron, involved, the, reduction, of, boric, oxide, with, metals, such, as, magnesium, or, aluminium, however, the, product, was, often, contaminated, with, borides, of, those, metals, pure, boron, can, be, prepared, by, reducing, volatile, boron, halides, with, hydrogen, at, high, temperatures, ultrapure, boron, for, use, in, the, semiconductor, industry, is, produced, by, the, decomposition, of, diborane, at, high, temperatures, and, then, further, purified, by, the, zone, melting, or, czochralski, processes, the, production, of, boron, compounds, does, not, involve, the, formation, of, elemental, boron, but, exploits, the, convenient, availability, of, borates, boron, is, similar, to, carbon, in, its, capability, to, form, stable, covalently, bonded, molecular, networks, even, nominally, disordered, amorphous, boron, contains, regular, boron, icosahedra, which, are, bonded, randomly, to, each, other, without, long, range, order, crystalline, boron, is, a, very, hard, black, material, with, a, melting, point, of, above, 2000, c, it, forms, four, major, allotropes, rhombohedral, and, rhombohedral, r, and, r, orthorhombic, and, tetragonal, t, all, four, phases, are, stable, at, ambient, conditions, and, rhombohedral, is, the, most, common, and, stable, an, tetragonal, phase, also, exists, t, but, is, very, difficult, to, produce, without, significant, contamination, most, of, the, phases, are, based, on, b, 12, icosahedra, but, the, phase, can, be, described, as, a, rocksalt, type, arrangement, of, the, icosahedra, and, b, 2, atomic, pairs, it, can, be, produced, by, compressing, other, boron, phases, to, 12, 20, gpa, and, heating, to, 1500, 1800, c, it, remains, stable, after, releasing, the, temperature, and, pressure, the, t, phase, is, produced, at, similar, pressures, but, higher, temperatures, of, 1800, 2200, c, the, t, and, t, phases, might, coexist, at, ambient, conditions, with, the, t, phase, being, the, more, stable, compressing, boron, above, 160, gpa, produces, a, boron, phase, with, an, as, yet, unknown, structure, and, this, phase, is, a, superconductor, at, temperatures, below, 6, 12, k, borospherene, fullerene, like, b, 40, molecules, and, borophene, proposed, graphene, like, structure, were, described, in, 2014, elemental, boron, is, rare, and, poorly, studied, because, the, pure, material, is, extremely, difficult, to, prepare, most, studies, of, boron, involve, samples, that, contain, small, amounts, of, carbon, the, chemical, behavior, of, boron, resembles, that, of, silicon, more, than, aluminium, crystalline, boron, is, chemically, inert, and, resistant, to, attack, by, boiling, hydrofluoric, or, hydrochloric, acid, when, finely, divided, it, is, attacked, slowly, by, hot, concentrated, hydrogen, peroxide, hot, concentrated, nitric, acid, hot, sulfuric, acid, or, hot, mixture, of, sulfuric, and, chromic, acids, the, rate, of, oxidation, of, boron, depends, on, the, crystallinity, particle, size, purity, and, temperature, boron, does, not, react, with, air, at, room, temperature, but, at, higher, temperatures, it, burns, to, form, boron, trioxide, boron, undergoes, halogenation, to, give, trihalides, for, example, the, trichloride, in, practice, is, usually, made, from, the, oxide, boron, is, the, lightest, element, having, an, electron, in, a, p, orbital, in, its, ground, state, unlike, most, other, p, elements, it, rarely, obeys, the, octet, rule, and, usually, places, only, six, electrons, in, three, molecular, orbitals, onto, its, valence, shell, boron, is, the, prototype, for, the, boron, group, the, iupac, group, 13, although, the, other, members, of, this, group, are, metals, and, more, typical, p, elements, only, aluminium, to, some, extent, shares, boron, s, aversion, to, the, octet, rule, boron, also, has, much, lower, electronegativity, than, subsequent, period, 2, elements, for, the, latter, lithium, salts, are, common, e, g, lithium, fluoride, lithium, hydroxide, lithium, amide, and, methyllithium, but, lithium, boryllides, are, extraordinarily, rare, strong, bases, do, not, deprotonate, a, borohydride, r, 2, bh, to, the, boryl, anion, r, 2, b, instead, forming, the, octet, complete, adduct, r, 2, hb, base, in, the, most, familiar, compounds, boron, has, the, formal, oxidation, state, iii, these, include, oxides, borates, sulfides, nitrides, and, halides, the, trihalides, adopt, a, planar, trigonal, structure, these, compounds, are, lewis, acids, in, that, they, readily, form, adducts, with, electron, pair, donors, which, are, called, lewis, bases, for, example, fluoride, f, and, boron, trifluoride, bf, 3, combined, to, give, the, tetrafluoroborate, anion, bf, 4, boron, trifluoride, is, used, in, the, petrochemical, industry, as, a, catalyst, the, halides, react, with, water, to, form, boric, acid, it, is, found, in, nature, on, earth, almost, entirely, as, various, oxides, of, b, iii, often, associated, with, other, elements, more, than, one, hundred, borate, minerals, contain, boron, in, oxidation, state, 3, these, minerals, resemble, silicates, in, some, respect, although, it, is, often, found, not, only, in, a, tetrahedral, coordination, with, oxygen, but, also, in, a, trigonal, planar, configuration, unlike, silicates, boron, minerals, never, contain, it, with, coordination, number, greater, than, four, a, typical, motif, is, exemplified, by, the, tetraborate, anions, of, the, common, mineral, borax, shown, at, left, the, formal, negative, charge, of, the, tetrahedral, borate, center, is, balanced, by, metal, cations, in, the, minerals, such, as, the, sodium, na, in, borax, the, tourmaline, group, of, borate, silicates, is, also, a, very, important, boron, bearing, mineral, group, and, a, number, of, borosilicates, are, also, known, to, exist, naturally, boranes, are, chemical, compounds, of, boron, and, hydrogen, with, the, generic, formula, of, b, x, h, y, these, compounds, do, not, occur, in, nature, many, of, the, boranes, readily, oxidise, on, contact, with, air, some, violently, the, parent, member, bh, 3, is, called, borane, but, it, is, known, only, in, the, gaseous, state, and, dimerises, to, form, diborane, b, 2, h, 6, the, larger, boranes, all, consist, of, boron, clusters, that, are, polyhedral, some, of, which, exist, as, isomers, for, example, isomers, of, b, 20, h, 26, are, based, on, the, fusion, of, two, 10, atom, clusters, the, most, important, boranes, are, diborane, b, 2, h, 6, and, two, of, its, pyrolysis, products, pentaborane, b, 5, h, 9, and, decaborane, b, 10, h, 14, a, large, number, of, anionic, boron, hydrides, are, known, e, g, 2, the, formal, oxidation, number, in, boranes, is, positive, and, is, based, on, the, assumption, that, hydrogen, is, counted, as, 1, as, in, active, metal, hydrides, the, mean, oxidation, number, for, the, borons, is, then, simply, the, ratio, of, hydrogen, to, boron, in, the, molecule, for, example, in, diborane, b, 2, h, 6, the, boron, oxidation, state, is, 3, but, in, decaborane, b, 10, h, 14, it, is, 7, 5, or, 1, 4, in, these, compounds, the, oxidation, state, of, boron, is, often, not, a, whole, number, the, boron, nitrides, are, notable, for, the, variety, of, structures, that, they, adopt, they, exhibit, structures, analogous, to, various, allotropes, of, carbon, including, graphite, diamond, and, nanotubes, in, the, diamond, like, structure, called, cubic, boron, nitride, tradename, borazon, boron, atoms, exist, in, the, tetrahedral, structure, of, carbon, atoms, in, diamond, but, one, in, every, four, b, n, bonds, can, be, viewed, as, a, coordinate, covalent, bond, wherein, two, electrons, are, donated, by, the, nitrogen, atom, which, acts, as, the, lewis, base, to, a, bond, to, the, lewis, acidic, boron, iii, centre, cubic, boron, nitride, among, other, applications, is, used, as, an, abrasive, as, it, has, a, hardness, comparable, with, diamond, the, two, substances, are, able, to, produce, scratches, on, each, other, in, the, bn, compound, analogue, of, graphite, hexagonal, boron, nitride, h, bn, the, positively, charged, boron, and, negatively, charged, nitrogen, atoms, in, each, plane, lie, adjacent, to, the, oppositely, charged, atom, in, the, next, plane, consequently, graphite, and, h, bn, have, very, different, properties, although, both, are, lubricants, as, these, planes, slip, past, each, other, easily, however, h, bn, is, a, relatively, poor, electrical, and, thermal, conductor, in, the, planar, directions, a, large, number, of, organoboron, compounds, are, known, and, many, are, useful, in, organic, synthesis, many, are, produced, from, hydroboration, which, employs, diborane, b, 2, h, 6, a, simple, borane, chemical, or, carboboration, organoboron, iii, compounds, are, usually, tetrahedral, or, trigonal, planar, for, example, tetraphenylborate, vs, triphenylborane, b, c, 6, h, 5, 3, however, multiple, boron, atoms, reacting, with, each, other, have, a, tendency, to, form, novel, dodecahedral, 12, sided, and, icosahedral, 20, sided, structures, composed, completely, of, boron, atoms, or, with, varying, numbers, of, carbon, heteroatoms, organoboron, chemicals, have, been, employed, in, uses, as, diverse, as, boron, carbide, see, below, a, complex, very, hard, ceramic, composed, of, boron, carbon, cluster, anions, and, cations, to, carboranes, carbon, boron, cluster, chemistry, compounds, that, can, be, halogenated, to, form, reactive, structures, including, carborane, acid, a, superacid, as, one, example, carboranes, form, useful, molecular, moieties, that, add, considerable, amounts, of, boron, to, other, biochemicals, in, order, to, synthesize, boron, containing, compounds, for, boron, neutron, capture, therapy, for, cancer, as, anticipated, by, its, hydride, clusters, boron, forms, a, variety, of, stable, compounds, with, formal, oxidation, state, less, than, three, b, 2, f, 4, and, b, 4, cl, 4, are, well, characterized, binary, metal, boron, compounds, the, metal, borides, contain, boron, in, negative, oxidation, states, illustrative, is, magnesium, diboride, mgb, 2, each, boron, atom, has, a, formal, 1, charge, and, magnesium, is, assigned, a, formal, charge, of, 2, in, this, material, the, boron, centers, are, trigonal, planar, with, an, extra, double, bond, for, each, boron, forming, sheets, akin, to, the, carbon, in, graphite, however, unlike, hexagonal, boron, nitride, which, lacks, electrons, in, the, plane, of, the, covalent, atoms, the, delocalized, electrons, in, magnesium, diboride, allow, it, to, conduct, electricity, similar, to, isoelectronic, graphite, in, 2001, this, material, was, found, to, be, a, high, temperature, superconductor, it, is, a, superconductor, under, active, development, a, project, at, cern, to, make, mgb, 2, cables, has, resulted, in, superconducting, test, cables, able, to, carry, 20, 000, amperes, for, extremely, high, current, distribution, applications, such, as, the, contemplated, high, luminosity, version, of, the, large, hadron, collider, certain, other, metal, borides, find, specialized, applications, as, hard, materials, for, cutting, tools, often, the, boron, in, borides, has, fractional, oxidation, states, such, as, 1, 3, in, calcium, hexaboride, cab, 6, from, the, structural, perspective, the, most, distinctive, chemical, compounds, of, boron, are, the, hydrides, included, in, this, series, are, the, cluster, compounds, dodecaborate, b, 12, h, 2, 12, decaborane, b, 10, h, 14, and, the, carboranes, such, as, c, 2, b, 10, h, 12, characteristically, such, compounds, contain, boron, with, coordination, numbers, greater, than, four, boron, has, two, naturally, occurring, and, stable, isotopes, 11, b, 80, 1, and, 10, b, 19, 9, the, mass, difference, results, in, a, wide, range, of, 11, b, values, which, are, defined, as, a, fractional, difference, between, the, 11, b, and, 10, b, and, traditionally, expressed, in, parts, per, thousand, in, natural, waters, ranging, from, 16, to, 59, there, are, 13, known, isotopes, of, boron, the, shortest, lived, isotope, is, 7, b, which, decays, through, proton, emission, and, alpha, decay, with, a, half, life, of, 3, 5, 10, 22, s, isotopic, fractionation, of, boron, is, controlled, by, the, exchange, reactions, of, the, boron, species, b, oh, 3, and, boron, isotopes, are, also, fractionated, during, mineral, crystallization, during, h, 2, o, phase, changes, in, hydrothermal, systems, and, during, hydrothermal, alteration, of, rock, the, latter, effect, results, in, preferential, removal, of, the, ion, onto, clays, it, results, in, solutions, enriched, in, 11, b, oh, 3, and, therefore, may, be, responsible, for, the, large, 11, b, enrichment, in, seawater, relative, to, both, oceanic, crust, and, continental, crust, this, difference, may, act, as, an, isotopic, signature, the, exotic, 17, b, exhibits, a, nuclear, halo, i, e, its, radius, is, appreciably, larger, than, that, predicted, by, the, liquid, drop, model, the, 10, b, isotope, is, useful, for, capturing, thermal, neutrons, see, neutron, cross, section, typical, cross, sections, the, nuclear, industry, enriches, natural, boron, to, nearly, pure, 10, b, the, less, valuable, by, product, depleted, boron, is, nearly, pure, 11, b, because, of, its, high, neutron, cross, section, boron, 10, is, often, used, to, control, fission, in, nuclear, reactors, as, a, neutron, capturing, substance, several, industrial, scale, enrichment, processes, have, been, developed, however, only, the, fractionated, vacuum, distillation, of, the, dimethyl, ether, adduct, of, boron, trifluoride, dme, bf, 3, and, column, chromatography, of, borates, are, being, used, enriched, boron, or, 10, b, is, used, in, both, radiation, shielding, and, is, the, primary, nuclide, used, in, neutron, capture, therapy, of, cancer, in, the, latter, boron, neutron, capture, therapy, or, bnct, a, compound, containing, 10, b, is, incorporated, into, a, pharmaceutical, which, is, selectively, taken, up, by, a, malignant, tumor, and, tissues, near, it, the, patient, is, then, treated, with, a, beam, of, low, energy, neutrons, at, a, relatively, low, neutron, radiation, dose, the, neutrons, however, trigger, energetic, and, short, range, secondary, alpha, particle, and, lithium, 7, heavy, ion, radiation, that, are, products, of, the, boron, neutron, nuclear, reaction, and, this, ion, radiation, additionally, bombards, the, tumor, especially, from, inside, the, tumor, cells, in, nuclear, reactors, 10, b, is, used, for, reactivity, control, and, in, emergency, shutdown, systems, it, can, serve, either, function, in, the, form, of, borosilicate, control, rods, or, as, boric, acid, in, pressurized, water, reactors, 10, b, boric, acid, is, added, to, the, reactor, coolant, after, the, plant, is, shut, down, for, refueling, when, the, plant, is, started, up, again, the, boric, acid, is, slowly, filtered, out, over, many, months, as, fissile, material, is, used, up, and, the, fuel, becomes, less, reactive, in, future, crewed, interplanetary, spacecraft, 10, b, has, a, theoretical, role, as, structural, material, as, boron, fibers, or, bn, nanotube, material, which, would, also, serve, a, special, role, in, the, radiation, shield, one, of, the, difficulties, in, dealing, with, cosmic, rays, which, are, mostly, high, energy, protons, is, that, some, secondary, radiation, from, interaction, of, cosmic, rays, and, spacecraft, materials, is, high, energy, spallation, neutrons, such, neutrons, can, be, moderated, by, materials, high, in, light, elements, such, as, polyethylene, but, the, moderated, neutrons, continue, to, be, a, radiation, hazard, unless, actively, absorbed, in, the, shielding, among, light, elements, that, absorb, thermal, neutrons, 6, li, and, 10, b, appear, as, potential, spacecraft, structural, materials, which, serve, both, for, mechanical, reinforcement, and, radiation, protection, cosmic, radiation, will, produce, secondary, neutrons, if, it, hits, spacecraft, structures, those, neutrons, will, be, captured, in, 10, b, if, it, is, present, in, the, spacecraft, s, semiconductors, producing, a, gamma, ray, an, alpha, particle, and, a, lithium, ion, those, resultant, decay, products, may, then, irradiate, nearby, semiconductor, chip, structures, causing, data, loss, bit, flipping, or, single, event, upset, in, radiation, hardened, semiconductor, designs, one, countermeasure, is, to, use, depleted, boron, which, is, greatly, enriched, in, 11, b, and, contains, almost, no, 10, b, this, is, useful, because, 11, b, is, largely, immune, to, radiation, damage, depleted, boron, is, a, byproduct, of, the, nuclear, industry, see, above, 11, b, is, also, a, candidate, as, a, fuel, for, aneutronic, fusion, when, struck, by, a, proton, with, energy, of, about, 500, k, ev, it, produces, three, alpha, particles, and, 8, 7, mev, of, energy, most, other, fusion, reactions, involving, hydrogen, and, helium, produce, penetrating, neutron, radiation, which, weakens, reactor, structures, and, induces, long, term, radioactivity, thereby, endangering, operating, personnel, the, alpha, particles, from, 11, b, fusion, can, be, turned, directly, into, electric, power, and, all, radiation, stops, as, soon, as, the, reactor, is, turned, off, both, 10, b, and, 11, b, possess, nuclear, spin, the, nuclear, spin, of, 10, b, is, 3, and, that, of, 11, b, is, 3, 2, these, isotopes, are, therefore, of, use, in, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, spectroscopy, and, spectrometers, specially, adapted, to, detecting, the, boron, 11, nuclei, are, available, commercially, the, 10, b, and, 11, b, nuclei, also, cause, splitting, in, the, resonances, of, attached, nuclei, boron, is, rare, in, the, universe, and, solar, system, due, to, trace, formation, in, the, big, bang, and, in, stars, it, is, formed, in, minor, amounts, in, cosmic, ray, spallation, nucleosynthesis, and, may, be, found, uncombined, in, cosmic, dust, and, meteoroid, materials, in, the, high, oxygen, environment, of, earth, boron, is, always, found, fully, oxidized, to, borate, boron, does, not, appear, on, earth, in, elemental, form, extremely, small, traces, of, elemental, boron, were, detected, in, lunar, regolith, although, boron, is, a, relatively, rare, element, in, the, earth, s, crust, representing, only, 0, 001, of, the, crust, mass, it, can, be, highly, concentrated, by, the, action, of, water, in, which, many, borates, are, soluble, it, is, found, naturally, combined, in, compounds, such, as, borax, and, boric, acid, sometimes, found, in, volcanic, spring, waters, about, a, hundred, borate, minerals, are, known, on, 5, september, 2017, scientists, reported, that, the, curiosity, rover, detected, boron, an, essential, ingredient, for, life, on, earth, on, the, planet, mars, such, a, finding, along, with, previous, discoveries, that, water, may, have, been, present, on, ancient, mars, further, supports, the, possible, early, habitability, of, gale, crater, on, mars, economically, important, sources, of, boron, are, the, minerals, colemanite, rasorite, kernite, ulexite, and, tincal, together, these, constitute, 90, of, mined, boron, containing, ore, the, largest, global, borax, deposits, known, many, still, untapped, are, in, central, and, western, turkey, including, the, provinces, of, eski, ehir, k, tahya, and, bal, kesir, global, proven, boron, mineral, mining, reserves, exceed, one, billion, metric, tonnes, against, a, yearly, production, of, about, four, million, tonnes, turkey, and, the, united, states, are, the, largest, producers, of, boron, products, turkey, produces, about, half, of, the, global, yearly, demand, through, eti, mine, works, turkish, eti, maden, letmeleri, a,

low, toxicity, levels, the, boranes, boron, hydrogen, compounds, and, similar, gaseous, compounds, are, quite, poisonous, as, usual, boron, is, not, an, element, that, is, intrinsically, poisonous, but, the, toxicity, of, these, compounds, depends, on, structure, for, another, example, of, this, phenomenon, see, phosphine, the, boranes, are, also, highly, flammable, and, require, special, care, when, handling, some, combinations, of, boranes, and, other, compounds, are, highly, explosive, sodium, borohydride, presents, a, fire, hazard, owing, to, its, reducing, nature, and, the, liberation, of, hydrogen, on, contact, with, acid, boron, halides, are, corrosive, boron, is, necessary, for, plant, growth, but, an, excess, of, boron, is, toxic, to, plants, and, occurs, particularly, in, acidic, soil, it, presents, as, a, yellowing, from, the, tip, inwards, of, the, oldest, leaves, and, black, spots, in, barley, leaves, but, it, can, be, confused, with, other, stresses, such, as, magnesium, deficiency, in, other, plants
