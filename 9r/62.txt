the, ampere, m, p, r, am, pair, us, m, p, r, am, peer, symbol, a, often, shortened, to, amp, is, the, unit, of, electric, current, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, one, ampere, is, equal, to, 1, coulomb, c, moving, past, a, point, per, second, it, is, named, after, french, mathematician, and, physicist, andr, marie, amp, re, 1775, 1836, considered, the, father, of, electromagnetism, along, with, danish, physicist, hans, christian, rsted, as, of, the, 2019, revision, of, the, si, the, ampere, is, defined, by, fixing, the, elementary, charge, e, to, be, exactly, 1, 602, 176, 634, 10, 19, c, which, means, an, ampere, is, an, electric, current, equivalent, to, 10, 19, elementary, charges, moving, every, 1, 602, 176, 634, seconds, or, 6, 241, 509, 074, 10, 18, elementary, charges, moving, in, a, second, prior, to, the, redefinition, the, ampere, was, defined, as, the, current, passing, through, two, parallel, wires, 1, metre, apart, that, produces, a, magnetic, force, of, 2, 10, 7, newtons, per, metre, the, earlier, cgs, system, has, two, units, of, current, one, structured, similarly, to, the, si, s, and, the, other, using, coulomb, s, law, as, a, fundamental, relationship, with, the, cgs, unit, of, charge, defined, by, measuring, the, force, between, two, charged, metal, plates, the, cgs, unit, of, current, is, then, defined, as, one, unit, of, charge, per, second, the, ampere, is, named, for, french, physicist, and, mathematician, andr, marie, amp, re, 1775, 1836, who, studied, electromagnetism, and, laid, the, foundation, of, electrodynamics, in, recognition, of, amp, re, s, contributions, to, the, creation, of, modern, electrical, science, an, international, convention, signed, at, the, 1881, international, exposition, of, electricity, established, the, ampere, as, a, standard, unit, of, electrical, measurement, for, electric, current, the, ampere, was, originally, defined, as, one, tenth, of, the, unit, of, electric, current, in, the, centimetre, gram, second, system, of, units, that, unit, now, known, as, the, abampere, was, defined, as, the, amount, of, current, that, generates, a, force, of, two, dynes, per, centimetre, of, length, between, two, wires, one, centimetre, apart, the, size, of, the, unit, was, chosen, so, that, the, units, derived, from, it, in, the, mksa, system, would, be, conveniently, sized, the, international, ampere, was, an, early, realization, of, the, ampere, defined, as, the, current, that, would, deposit, 0, 001, 118, grams, of, silver, per, second, from, a, silver, nitrate, solution, later, more, accurate, measurements, revealed, that, this, current, is, 0, 999, 85, a, since, power, is, defined, as, the, product, of, current, and, voltage, the, ampere, can, alternatively, be, expressed, in, terms, of, the, other, units, using, the, relationship, i, p, v, and, thus, 1, a, 1, w, v, current, can, be, measured, by, a, multimeter, a, device, that, can, measure, electrical, voltage, current, and, resistance, until, 2019, the, si, defined, the, ampere, as, follows, the, ampere, is, that, constant, current, which, if, maintained, in, two, straight, parallel, conductors, of, infinite, length, of, negligible, circular, cross, section, and, placed, one, metre, apart, in, vacuum, would, produce, between, these, conductors, a, force, equal, to, 2, 10, 7, newtons, per, metre, of, length, 113, amp, re, s, force, law, states, that, there, is, an, attractive, or, repulsive, force, between, two, parallel, wires, carrying, an, electric, current, this, force, is, used, in, the, formal, definition, of, the, ampere, the, si, unit, of, charge, the, coulomb, was, then, defined, as, the, quantity, of, electricity, carried, in, 1, second, by, a, current, of, 1, ampere, 144, conversely, a, current, of, one, ampere, is, one, coulomb, of, charge, going, past, a, given, point, per, second, in, general, charge, q, was, determined, by, steady, current, i, flowing, for, a, time, t, as, q, it, this, definition, of, the, ampere, was, most, accurately, realised, using, a, kibble, balance, but, in, practice, the, unit, was, maintained, via, ohm, s, law, from, the, units, of, electromotive, force, and, resistance, the, volt, and, the, ohm, since, the, latter, two, could, be, tied, to, physical, phenomena, that, are, relatively, easy, to, reproduce, the, josephson, effect, and, the, quantum, hall, effect, respectively, techniques, to, establish, the, realisation, of, an, ampere, had, a, relative, uncertainty, of, approximately, a, few, parts, in, 10, 7, and, involved, realisations, of, the, watt, the, ohm, and, the, volt, the, 2019, revision, of, the, si, defined, the, ampere, by, taking, the, fixed, numerical, value, of, the, elementary, charge, e, to, be, 1, 602, 176, 634, 10, 19, when, expressed, in, the, unit, c, which, is, equal, to, a, s, where, the, second, is, defined, in, terms, of, cs, the, unperturbed, ground, state, hyperfine, transition, frequency, of, the, caesium, 133, atom, the, si, unit, of, charge, the, coulomb, is, the, quantity, of, electricity, carried, in, 1, second, by, a, current, of, 1, ampere, conversely, a, current, of, one, ampere, is, one, coulomb, of, charge, going, past, a, given, point, per, second, in, general, charge, q, is, determined, by, steady, current, i, flowing, for, a, time, t, as, q, i, t, constant, instantaneous, and, average, current, are, expressed, in, amperes, as, in, the, charging, current, is, 1, 2, a, and, the, charge, accumulated, or, passed, through, a, circuit, over, a, period, of, time, is, expressed, in, coulombs, as, in, the, battery, charge, is, 30, 000, c, the, relation, of, the, ampere, c, s, to, the, coulomb, is, the, same, as, that, of, the, watt, j, s, to, the, joule, the, international, system, of, units, si, is, based, on, seven, si, base, units, the, second, metre, kilogram, kelvin, ampere, mole, and, candela, representing, seven, fundamental, types, of, physical, quantity, or, dimensions, time, length, mass, temperature, electric, current, amount, of, substance, and, luminous, intensity, respectively, with, all, other, si, units, being, defined, using, these, these, si, derived, units, can, either, be, given, special, names, e, g, watt, volt, lux, etc, or, defined, in, terms, of, others, e, g, metre, per, second, the, units, with, special, names, derived, from, the, ampere, are, there, are, also, some, si, units, that, are, frequently, used, in, the, context, of, electrical, engineering, and, electrical, appliances, but, are, defined, independently, of, the, ampere, notably, the, hertz, joule, watt, candela, lumen, and, lux, like, other, si, units, the, ampere, can, be, modified, by, adding, a, prefix, that, multiplies, it, by, a, power, of, 10
