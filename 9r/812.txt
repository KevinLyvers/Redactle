in, classical, physics, and, general, chemistry, matter, is, any, substance, that, has, mass, and, takes, up, space, by, having, volume, all, everyday, objects, that, can, be, touched, are, ultimately, composed, of, atoms, which, are, made, up, of, interacting, subatomic, particles, and, in, everyday, as, well, as, scientific, usage, matter, generally, includes, atoms, and, anything, made, up, of, them, and, any, particles, or, combination, of, particles, that, act, as, if, they, have, both, rest, mass, and, volume, however, it, does, not, include, massless, particles, such, as, photons, or, other, energy, phenomena, or, waves, such, as, light, or, heat, 21, matter, exists, in, various, states, also, known, as, phases, these, include, classical, everyday, phases, such, as, solid, liquid, and, gas, for, example, water, exists, as, ice, liquid, water, and, gaseous, steam, but, other, states, are, possible, including, plasma, bose, einstein, condensates, fermionic, condensates, and, quark, gluon, plasma, usually, atoms, can, be, imagined, as, a, nucleus, of, protons, and, neutrons, and, a, surrounding, cloud, of, orbiting, electrons, which, take, up, space, however, this, is, only, somewhat, correct, because, subatomic, particles, and, their, properties, are, governed, by, their, quantum, nature, which, means, they, do, not, act, as, everyday, objects, appear, to, act, they, can, act, like, waves, as, well, as, particles, and, they, do, not, have, well, defined, sizes, or, positions, in, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, matter, is, not, a, fundamental, concept, because, the, elementary, constituents, of, atoms, are, quantum, entities, which, do, not, have, an, inherent, size, or, volume, in, any, everyday, sense, of, the, word, due, to, the, exclusion, principle, and, other, fundamental, interactions, some, point, particles, known, as, fermions, quarks, leptons, and, many, composites, and, atoms, are, effectively, forced, to, keep, a, distance, from, other, particles, under, everyday, conditions, this, creates, the, property, of, matter, which, appears, to, us, as, matter, taking, up, space, for, much, of, the, history, of, the, natural, sciences, people, have, contemplated, the, exact, nature, of, matter, the, idea, that, matter, was, built, of, discrete, building, blocks, the, so, called, particulate, theory, of, matter, appeared, in, both, ancient, greece, and, ancient, india, early, philosophers, who, proposed, the, particulate, theory, of, matter, include, the, ancient, indian, philosopher, kanada, c, 6th, century, bce, or, after, pre, socratic, greek, philosopher, leucippus, 490, bce, and, pre, socratic, greek, philosopher, democritus, 470, 380, bce, matter, should, not, be, confused, with, mass, as, the, two, are, not, the, same, in, modern, physics, matter, is, a, general, term, describing, any, physical, substance, by, contrast, mass, is, not, a, substance, but, rather, a, quantitative, property, of, matter, and, other, substances, or, systems, various, types, of, mass, are, defined, within, physics, including, but, not, limited, to, rest, mass, inertial, mass, relativistic, mass, mass, energy, while, there, are, different, views, on, what, should, be, considered, matter, the, mass, of, a, substance, has, exact, scientific, definitions, another, difference, is, that, matter, has, an, opposite, called, antimatter, but, mass, has, no, opposite, there, is, no, such, thing, as, anti, mass, or, negative, mass, so, far, as, is, known, although, scientists, do, discuss, the, concept, antimatter, has, the, same, i, e, positive, mass, property, as, its, normal, matter, counterpart, different, fields, of, science, use, the, term, matter, in, different, and, sometimes, incompatible, ways, some, of, these, ways, are, based, on, loose, historical, meanings, from, a, time, when, there, was, no, reason, to, distinguish, mass, from, simply, a, quantity, of, matter, as, such, there, is, no, single, universally, agreed, scientific, meaning, of, the, word, matter, scientifically, the, term, mass, is, well, defined, but, matter, can, be, defined, in, several, ways, sometimes, in, the, field, of, physics, matter, is, simply, equated, with, particles, that, exhibit, rest, mass, i, e, that, cannot, travel, at, the, speed, of, light, such, as, quarks, and, leptons, however, in, both, physics, and, chemistry, matter, exhibits, both, wave, like, and, particle, like, properties, the, so, called, wave, particle, duality, a, chemical, substance, is, a, unique, form, of, matter, with, constant, chemical, composition, and, characteristic, properties, chemical, substances, may, take, the, form, of, a, single, element, or, chemical, compounds, if, two, or, more, chemical, substances, can, be, combined, without, reacting, they, may, form, a, chemical, mixture, if, a, mixture, is, separated, to, isolate, one, chemical, substance, to, a, desired, degree, the, resulting, substance, is, said, to, be, chemically, pure, chemical, substances, can, exist, in, several, different, physical, states, or, phases, e, g, solids, liquids, gases, or, plasma, without, changing, their, chemical, composition, substances, transition, between, these, phases, of, matter, in, response, to, changes, in, temperature, or, pressure, some, chemical, substances, can, be, combined, or, converted, into, new, substances, by, means, of, chemical, reactions, chemicals, that, do, not, possess, this, ability, are, said, to, be, inert, a, definition, of, matter, based, on, its, physical, and, chemical, structure, is, matter, is, made, up, of, atoms, such, atomic, matter, is, also, sometimes, termed, ordinary, matter, as, an, example, deoxyribonucleic, acid, molecules, dna, are, matter, under, this, definition, because, they, are, made, of, atoms, this, definition, can, be, extended, to, include, charged, atoms, and, molecules, so, as, to, include, plasmas, gases, of, ions, and, electrolytes, ionic, solutions, which, are, not, obviously, included, in, the, atoms, definition, alternatively, one, can, adopt, the, protons, neutrons, and, electrons, definition, a, definition, of, matter, more, fine, scale, than, the, atoms, and, molecules, definition, is, matter, is, made, up, of, what, atoms, and, molecules, are, made, of, meaning, anything, made, of, positively, charged, protons, neutral, neutrons, and, negatively, charged, electrons, this, definition, goes, beyond, atoms, and, molecules, however, to, include, substances, made, from, these, building, blocks, that, are, not, simply, atoms, or, molecules, for, example, electron, beams, in, an, old, cathode, ray, tube, television, or, white, dwarf, matter, typically, carbon, and, oxygen, nuclei, in, a, sea, of, degenerate, electrons, at, a, microscopic, level, the, constituent, particles, of, matter, such, as, protons, neutrons, and, electrons, obey, the, laws, of, quantum, mechanics, and, exhibit, wave, particle, duality, at, an, even, deeper, level, protons, and, neutrons, are, made, up, of, quarks, and, the, force, fields, gluons, that, bind, them, together, leading, to, the, next, definition, as, seen, in, the, above, discussion, many, early, definitions, of, what, can, be, called, ordinary, matter, were, based, upon, its, structure, or, building, blocks, on, the, scale, of, elementary, particles, a, definition, that, follows, this, tradition, can, be, stated, as, ordinary, matter, is, everything, that, is, composed, of, quarks, and, leptons, or, ordinary, matter, is, everything, that, is, composed, of, any, elementary, fermions, except, antiquarks, and, antileptons, the, connection, between, these, formulations, follows, leptons, the, most, famous, being, the, electron, and, quarks, of, which, baryons, such, as, protons, and, neutrons, are, made, combine, to, form, atoms, which, in, turn, form, molecules, because, atoms, and, molecules, are, said, to, be, matter, it, is, natural, to, phrase, the, definition, as, ordinary, matter, is, anything, that, is, made, of, the, same, things, that, atoms, and, molecules, are, made, of, however, notice, that, one, also, can, make, from, these, building, blocks, matter, that, is, not, atoms, or, molecules, then, because, electrons, are, leptons, and, protons, and, neutrons, are, made, of, quarks, this, definition, in, turn, leads, to, the, definition, of, matter, as, being, quarks, and, leptons, which, are, two, of, the, four, types, of, elementary, fermions, the, other, two, being, antiquarks, and, antileptons, which, can, be, considered, antimatter, as, described, later, carithers, and, grannis, state, ordinary, matter, is, composed, entirely, of, first, generation, particles, namely, the, and, quarks, plus, the, electron, and, its, neutrino, higher, generations, particles, quickly, decay, into, first, generation, particles, and, thus, are, not, commonly, encountered, this, definition, of, ordinary, matter, is, more, subtle, than, it, first, appears, all, the, particles, that, make, up, ordinary, matter, leptons, and, quarks, are, elementary, fermions, while, all, the, force, carriers, are, elementary, bosons, the, w, and, z, bosons, that, mediate, the, weak, force, are, not, made, of, quarks, or, leptons, and, so, are, not, ordinary, matter, even, if, they, have, mass, in, other, words, mass, is, not, something, that, is, exclusive, to, ordinary, matter, the, quark, lepton, definition, of, ordinary, matter, however, identifies, not, only, the, elementary, building, blocks, of, matter, but, also, includes, composites, made, from, the, constituents, atoms, and, molecules, for, example, such, composites, contain, an, interaction, energy, that, holds, the, constituents, together, and, may, constitute, the, bulk, of, the, mass, of, the, composite, as, an, example, to, a, great, extent, the, mass, of, an, atom, is, simply, the, sum, of, the, masses, of, its, constituent, protons, neutrons, and, electrons, however, digging, deeper, the, protons, and, neutrons, are, made, up, of, quarks, bound, together, by, gluon, fields, see, dynamics, of, quantum, chromodynamics, and, these, gluon, fields, contribute, significantly, to, the, mass, of, hadrons, in, other, words, most, of, what, composes, the, mass, of, ordinary, matter, is, due, to, the, binding, energy, of, quarks, within, protons, and, neutrons, for, example, the, sum, of, the, mass, of, the, three, quarks, in, a, nucleon, is, approximately, 12, 5, mev, c, 2, which, is, low, compared, to, the, mass, of, a, nucleon, approximately, 938, mev, c, 2, the, bottom, line, is, that, most, of, the, mass, of, everyday, objects, comes, from, the, interaction, energy, of, its, elementary, components, the, standard, model, groups, matter, particles, into, three, generations, where, each, generation, consists, of, two, quarks, and, two, leptons, the, first, generation, is, the, up, and, down, quarks, the, electron, and, the, electron, neutrino, the, second, includes, the, charm, and, strange, quarks, the, muon, and, the, muon, neutrino, the, third, generation, consists, of, the, top, and, bottom, quarks, and, the, tau, and, tau, neutrino, the, most, natural, explanation, for, this, would, be, that, quarks, and, leptons, of, higher, generations, are, excited, states, of, the, first, generations, if, this, turns, out, to, be, the, case, it, would, imply, that, quarks, and, leptons, are, composite, particles, rather, than, elementary, particles, this, quark, lepton, definition, of, matter, also, leads, to, what, can, be, described, as, conservation, of, net, matter, laws, discussed, later, below, alternatively, one, could, return, to, the, mass, volume, space, concept, of, matter, leading, to, the, next, definition, in, which, antimatter, becomes, included, as, a, subclass, of, matter, a, common, or, traditional, definition, of, matter, is, anything, that, has, mass, and, volume, occupies, space, for, example, a, car, would, be, said, to, be, made, of, matter, as, it, has, mass, and, volume, occupies, space, the, observation, that, matter, occupies, space, goes, back, to, antiquity, however, an, explanation, for, why, matter, occupies, space, is, recent, and, is, argued, to, be, a, result, of, the, phenomenon, described, in, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, which, applies, to, fermions, two, particular, examples, where, the, exclusion, principle, clearly, relates, matter, to, the, occupation, of, space, are, white, dwarf, stars, and, neutron, stars, discussed, further, below, thus, matter, can, be, defined, as, everything, composed, of, elementary, fermions, although, we, do, not, encounter, them, in, everyday, life, antiquarks, such, as, the, antiproton, and, antileptons, such, as, the, positron, are, the, antiparticles, of, the, quark, and, the, lepton, are, elementary, fermions, as, well, and, have, essentially, the, same, properties, as, quarks, and, leptons, including, the, applicability, of, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, which, can, be, said, to, prevent, two, particles, from, being, in, the, same, place, at, the, same, time, in, the, same, state, i, e, makes, each, particle, take, up, space, this, particular, definition, leads, to, matter, being, defined, to, include, anything, made, of, these, antimatter, particles, as, well, as, the, ordinary, quark, and, lepton, and, thus, also, anything, made, of, mesons, which, are, unstable, particles, made, up, of, a, quark, and, an, antiquark, in, the, context, of, relativity, mass, is, not, an, additive, quantity, in, the, sense, that, one, cannot, add, the, rest, masses, of, particles, in, a, system, to, get, the, total, rest, mass, of, the, system, 21, in, relativity, usually, a, more, general, view, is, that, it, is, not, the, sum, of, rest, masses, but, the, energy, momentum, tensor, that, quantifies, the, amount, of, matter, this, tensor, gives, the, rest, mass, for, the, entire, system, matter, therefore, is, sometimes, considered, as, anything, that, contributes, to, the, energy, momentum, of, a, system, that, is, anything, that, is, not, purely, gravity, this, view, is, commonly, held, in, fields, that, deal, with, general, relativity, such, as, cosmology, in, this, view, light, and, other, massless, particles, and, fields, are, all, part, of, matter, in, particle, physics, fermions, are, particles, that, obey, fermi, dirac, statistics, fermions, can, be, elementary, like, the, electron, or, composite, like, the, proton, and, neutron, in, the, standard, model, there, are, two, types, of, elementary, fermions, quarks, and, leptons, which, are, discussed, next, quarks, are, massive, particles, of, spin, 1, 2, implying, that, they, are, fermions, they, carry, an, electric, charge, of, 1, 3, e, down, type, quarks, or, 2, 3, e, up, type, quarks, for, comparison, an, electron, has, a, charge, of, 1, e, they, also, carry, colour, charge, which, is, the, equivalent, of, the, electric, charge, for, the, strong, interaction, quarks, also, undergo, radioactive, decay, meaning, that, they, are, subject, to, the, weak, interaction, baryons, are, strongly, interacting, fermions, and, so, are, subject, to, fermi, dirac, statistics, amongst, the, baryons, are, the, protons, and, neutrons, which, occur, in, atomic, nuclei, but, many, other, unstable, baryons, exist, as, well, the, term, baryon, usually, refers, to, triquarks, particles, made, of, three, quarks, also, exotic, baryons, made, of, four, quarks, and, one, antiquark, are, known, as, pentaquarks, but, their, existence, is, not, generally, accepted, baryonic, matter, is, the, part, of, the, universe, that, is, made, of, baryons, including, all, atoms, this, part, of, the, universe, does, not, include, dark, energy, dark, matter, black, holes, or, various, forms, of, degenerate, matter, such, as, those, that, compose, white, dwarf, stars, and, neutron, stars, microwave, light, seen, by, wilkinson, microwave, anisotropy, probe, wmap, suggests, that, only, about, 4, 6, of, that, part, of, the, universe, within, range, of, the, best, telescopes, that, is, matter, that, may, be, visible, because, light, could, reach, us, from, it, is, made, of, baryonic, matter, about, 26, 8, is, dark, matter, and, about, 68, 3, is, dark, energy, the, great, majority, of, ordinary, matter, in, the, universe, is, unseen, since, visible, stars, and, gas, inside, galaxies, and, clusters, account, for, less, than, 10, per, cent, of, the, ordinary, matter, contribution, to, the, mass, energy, density, of, the, universe, hadronic, matter, can, refer, to, ordinary, baryonic, matter, made, from, hadrons, baryons, and, mesons, or, quark, matter, a, generalisation, of, atomic, nuclei, i, e, the, low, temperature, qcd, matter, it, includes, degenerate, matter, and, the, result, of, high, energy, heavy, nuclei, collisions, in, physics, degenerate, matter, refers, to, the, ground, state, of, a, gas, of, fermions, at, a, temperature, near, absolute, zero, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, requires, that, only, two, fermions, can, occupy, a, quantum, state, one, spin, up, and, the, other, spin, down, hence, at, zero, temperature, the, fermions, fill, up, sufficient, levels, to, accommodate, all, the, available, fermions, and, in, the, case, of, many, fermions, the, maximum, kinetic, energy, called, the, fermi, energy, and, the, pressure, of, the, gas, becomes, very, large, and, depends, on, the, number, of, fermions, rather, than, the, temperature, unlike, normal, states, of, matter, degenerate, matter, is, thought, to, occur, during, the, evolution, of, heavy, stars, the, demonstration, by, subrahmanyan, chandrasekhar, that, white, dwarf, stars, have, a, maximum, allowed, mass, because, of, the, exclusion, principle, caused, a, revolution, in, the, theory, of, star, evolution, degenerate, matter, includes, the, part, of, the, universe, that, is, made, up, of, neutron, stars, and, white, dwarfs, strange, matter, is, a, particular, form, of, quark, matter, usually, thought, of, as, a, liquid, of, up, down, and, strange, quarks, it, is, contrasted, with, nuclear, matter, which, is, a, liquid, of, neutrons, and, protons, which, themselves, are, built, out, of, up, and, down, quarks, and, with, non, strange, quark, matter, which, is, a, quark, liquid, that, contains, only, up, and, down, quarks, at, high, enough, density, strange, matter, is, expected, to, be, color, superconducting, strange, matter, is, hypothesized, to, occur, in, the, core, of, neutron, stars, or, more, speculatively, as, isolated, droplets, that, may, vary, in, size, from, femtometers, strangelets, to, kilometers, quark, stars, in, particle, physics, and, astrophysics, the, term, is, used, in, two, ways, one, broader, and, the, other, more, specific, leptons, are, particles, of, spin, 1, 2, meaning, that, they, are, fermions, they, carry, an, electric, charge, of, 1, e, charged, leptons, or, 0, e, neutrinos, unlike, quarks, leptons, do, not, carry, colour, charge, meaning, that, they, do, not, experience, the, strong, interaction, leptons, also, undergo, radioactive, decay, meaning, that, they, are, subject, to, the, weak, interaction, leptons, are, massive, particles, therefore, are, subject, to, gravity, in, bulk, matter, can, exist, in, several, different, forms, or, states, of, aggregation, known, as, phases, depending, on, ambient, pressure, temperature, and, volume, a, phase, is, a, form, of, matter, that, has, a, relatively, uniform, chemical, composition, and, physical, properties, such, as, density, specific, heat, refractive, index, and, so, forth, these, phases, include, the, three, familiar, ones, solids, liquids, and, gases, as, well, as, more, exotic, states, of, matter, such, as, plasmas, superfluids, supersolids, bose, einstein, condensates, a, fluid, may, be, a, liquid, gas, or, plasma, there, are, also, paramagnetic, and, ferromagnetic, phases, of, magnetic, materials, as, conditions, change, matter, may, change, from, one, phase, into, another, these, phenomena, are, called, phase, transitions, and, are, studied, in, the, field, of, thermodynamics, in, nanomaterials, the, vastly, increased, ratio, of, surface, area, to, volume, results, in, matter, that, can, exhibit, properties, entirely, different, from, those, of, bulk, material, and, not, well, described, by, any, bulk, phase, see, nanomaterials, for, more, details, phases, are, sometimes, called, states, of, matter, but, this, term, can, lead, to, confusion, with, thermodynamic, states, for, example, two, gases, maintained, at, different, pressures, are, in, different, thermodynamic, states, different, pressures, but, in, the, same, phase, both, are, gases, antimatter, is, matter, that, is, composed, of, the, antiparticles, of, those, that, constitute, ordinary, matter, if, a, particle, and, its, antiparticle, come, into, contact, with, each, other, the, two, annihilate, that, is, they, may, both, be, converted, into, other, particles, with, equal, energy, in, accordance, with, albert, einstein, s, equation, e, mc, 2, these, new, particles, may, be, high, energy, photons, gamma, rays, or, other, particle, antiparticle, pairs, the, resulting, particles, are, endowed, with, an, amount, of, kinetic, energy, equal, to, the, difference, between, the, rest, mass, of, the, products, of, the, annihilation, and, the, rest, mass, of, the, original, particle, antiparticle, pair, which, is, often, quite, large, depending, on, which, definition, of, matter, is, adopted, antimatter, can, be, said, to, be, a, particular, subclass, of, matter, or, the, opposite, of, matter, antimatter, is, not, found, naturally, on, earth, except, very, briefly, and, in, vanishingly, small, quantities, as, the, result, of, radioactive, decay, lightning, or, cosmic, rays, this, is, because, antimatter, that, came, to, exist, on, earth, outside, the, confines, of, a, suitable, physics, laboratory, would, almost, instantly, meet, the, ordinary, matter, that, earth, is, made, of, and, be, annihilated, antiparticles, and, some, stable, antimatter, such, as, antihydrogen, can, be, made, in, tiny, amounts, but, not, in, enough, quantity, to, do, more, than, test, a, few, of, its, theoretical, properties, there, is, considerable, speculation, both, in, science, and, science, fiction, as, to, why, the, observable, universe, is, apparently, almost, entirely, matter, in, the, sense, of, quarks, and, leptons, but, not, antiquarks, or, antileptons, and, whether, other, places, are, almost, entirely, antimatter, antiquarks, and, antileptons, instead, in, the, early, universe, it, is, thought, that, matter, and, antimatter, were, equally, represented, and, the, disappearance, of, antimatter, requires, an, asymmetry, in, physical, laws, called, cp, charge, parity, symmetry, violation, which, can, be, obtained, from, the, standard, model, but, at, this, time, the, apparent, asymmetry, of, matter, and, antimatter, in, the, visible, universe, is, one, of, the, great, unsolved, problems, in, physics, possible, processes, by, which, it, came, about, are, explored, in, more, detail, under, baryogenesis, formally, antimatter, particles, can, be, defined, by, their, negative, baryon, number, or, lepton, number, while, normal, non, antimatter, matter, particles, have, positive, baryon, or, lepton, number, these, two, classes, of, particles, are, the, antiparticle, partners, of, one, another, in, october, 2017, scientists, reported, further, evidence, that, matter, and, antimatter, equally, produced, at, the, big, bang, are, identical, should, completely, annihilate, each, other, and, as, a, result, the, universe, should, not, exist, this, implies, that, there, must, be, something, as, yet, unknown, to, scientists, that, either, stopped, the, complete, mutual, destruction, of, matter, and, antimatter, in, the, early, forming, universe, or, that, gave, rise, to, an, imbalance, between, the, two, forms, two, quantities, that, can, define, an, amount, of, matter, in, the, quark, lepton, sense, and, antimatter, in, an, antiquark, antilepton, sense, baryon, number, and, lepton, number, are, conserved, in, the, standard, model, a, baryon, such, as, the, proton, or, neutron, has, a, baryon, number, of, one, and, a, quark, because, there, are, three, in, a, baryon, is, given, a, baryon, number, of, 1, 3, so, the, net, amount, of, matter, as, measured, by, the, number, of, quarks, minus, the, number, of, antiquarks, which, each, have, a, baryon, number, of, 1, 3, which, is, proportional, to, baryon, number, and, number, of, leptons, minus, antileptons, which, is, called, the, lepton, number, is, practically, impossible, to, change, in, any, process, even, in, a, nuclear, bomb, none, of, the, baryons, protons, and, neutrons, of, which, the, atomic, nuclei, are, composed, are, destroyed, there, are, as, many, baryons, after, as, before, the, reaction, so, none, of, these, matter, particles, are, actually, destroyed, and, none, are, even, converted, to, non, matter, particles, like, photons, of, light, or, radiation, instead, nuclear, and, perhaps, chromodynamic, binding, energy, is, released, as, these, baryons, become, bound, into, mid, size, nuclei, having, less, energy, and, equivalently, less, mass, per, nucleon, compared, to, the, original, small, hydrogen, and, large, plutonium, etc, nuclei, even, in, electron, positron, annihilation, there, is, no, net, matter, being, destroyed, because, there, was, zero, net, matter, zero, total, lepton, number, and, baryon, number, to, begin, with, before, the, annihilation, one, lepton, minus, one, antilepton, equals, zero, net, lepton, number, and, this, net, amount, matter, does, not, change, as, it, simply, remains, zero, after, the, annihilation, in, short, matter, as, defined, in, physics, refers, to, baryons, and, leptons, the, amount, of, matter, is, defined, in, terms, of, baryon, and, lepton, number, baryons, and, leptons, can, be, created, but, their, creation, is, accompanied, by, antibaryons, or, antileptons, and, they, can, be, destroyed, by, annihilating, them, with, antibaryons, or, antileptons, since, antibaryons, antileptons, have, negative, baryon, lepton, numbers, the, overall, baryon, lepton, numbers, are, not, changed, so, matter, is, conserved, however, baryons, leptons, and, antibaryons, antileptons, all, have, positive, mass, so, the, total, amount, of, mass, is, not, conserved, further, outside, of, natural, or, artificial, nuclear, reactions, there, is, almost, no, antimatter, generally, available, in, the, universe, see, baryon, asymmetry, and, leptogenesis, so, particle, annihilation, is, rare, in, normal, circumstances, pie, chart, showing, the, fractions, of, energy, in, the, universe, contributed, by, different, sources, ordinary, matter, is, divided, into, luminous, matter, the, stars, and, luminous, gases, and, 0,

steinhardt, for, more, information, see, nasa, ordinary, matter, in, the, quarks, and, leptons, definition, constitutes, about, 4, of, the, energy, of, the, observable, universe, the, remaining, energy, is, theorized, to, be, due, to, exotic, forms, of, which, 23, is, dark, matter, and, 73, is, dark, energy, in, astrophysics, and, cosmology, dark, matter, is, matter, of, unknown, composition, that, does, not, emit, or, reflect, enough, electromagnetic, radiation, to, be, observed, directly, but, whose, presence, can, be, inferred, from, gravitational, effects, on, visible, matter, observational, evidence, of, the, early, universe, and, the, big, bang, theory, require, that, this, matter, have, energy, and, mass, but, not, be, composed, of, ordinary, baryons, protons, and, neutrons, the, commonly, accepted, view, is, that, most, of, the, dark, matter, is, non, baryonic, in, nature, as, such, it, is, composed, of, particles, as, yet, unobserved, in, the, laboratory, perhaps, they, are, supersymmetric, particles, which, are, not, standard, model, particles, but, relics, formed, at, very, high, energies, in, the, early, phase, of, the, universe, and, still, floating, about, in, cosmology, dark, energy, is, the, name, given, to, the, source, of, the, repelling, influence, that, is, accelerating, the, rate, of, expansion, of, the, universe, its, precise, nature, is, currently, a, mystery, although, its, effects, can, reasonably, be, modeled, by, assigning, matter, like, properties, such, as, energy, density, and, pressure, to, the, vacuum, itself, fully, 70, of, the, matter, density, in, the, universe, appears, to, be, in, the, form, of, dark, energy, twenty, six, percent, is, dark, matter, only, 4, is, ordinary, matter, so, less, than, 1, part, in, 20, is, made, out, of, matter, we, have, observed, experimentally, or, described, in, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, of, the, other, 96, apart, from, the, properties, just, mentioned, we, know, absolutely, nothing, exotic, matter, is, a, concept, of, particle, physics, which, may, include, dark, matter, and, dark, energy, but, goes, further, to, include, any, hypothetical, material, that, violates, one, or, more, of, the, properties, of, known, forms, of, matter, some, such, materials, might, possess, hypothetical, properties, like, negative, mass, in, ancient, india, the, buddhist, hindu, and, jain, philosophical, traditions, each, posited, that, matter, was, made, of, atoms, paramanu, pudgala, that, were, eternal, indestructible, without, parts, and, innumerable, and, which, associated, or, dissociated, to, form, more, complex, matter, according, to, the, laws, of, nature, they, coupled, their, ideas, of, soul, or, lack, thereof, into, their, theory, of, matter, the, strongest, developers, and, defenders, of, this, theory, were, the, nyaya, vaisheshika, school, with, the, ideas, of, the, indian, philosopher, kanada, being, the, most, followed, buddhist, philosophers, also, developed, these, ideas, in, late, 1st, millennium, ce, ideas, that, were, similar, to, the, vaisheshika, school, but, ones, that, did, not, include, any, soul, or, conscience, jain, philosophers, included, the, soul, jiva, adding, qualities, such, as, taste, smell, touch, and, color, to, each, atom, they, extended, the, ideas, found, in, early, literature, of, the, hindus, and, buddhists, by, adding, that, atoms, are, either, humid, or, dry, and, this, quality, cements, matter, they, also, proposed, the, possibility, that, atoms, combine, because, of, the, attraction, of, opposites, and, the, soul, attaches, to, these, atoms, transforms, with, karma, residue, and, transmigrates, with, each, rebirth, in, ancient, greece, pre, socratic, philosophers, speculated, the, underlying, nature, of, the, visible, world, thales, c, 624, bce, c, 546, bce, regarded, water, as, the, fundamental, material, of, the, world, anaximander, c, 610, bce, c, 546, bce, posited, that, the, basic, material, was, wholly, characterless, or, limitless, the, infinite, apeiron, anaximenes, flourished, 585, bce, d, 528, bce, posited, that, the, basic, stuff, was, pneuma, or, air, heraclitus, c, 535, c, 475, bce, seems, to, say, the, basic, element, is, fire, though, perhaps, he, means, that, all, is, change, empedocles, c, 490, 430, bce, spoke, of, four, elements, of, which, everything, was, made, earth, water, air, and, fire, meanwhile, parmenides, argued, that, change, does, not, exist, and, democritus, argued, that, everything, is, composed, of, minuscule, inert, bodies, of, all, shapes, called, atoms, a, philosophy, called, atomism, all, of, these, notions, had, deep, philosophical, problems, aristotle, 384, 322, bce, was, the, first, to, put, the, conception, on, a, sound, philosophical, basis, which, he, did, in, his, natural, philosophy, especially, in, physics, book, i, he, adopted, as, reasonable, suppositions, the, four, empedoclean, elements, but, added, a, fifth, aether, nevertheless, these, elements, are, not, basic, in, aristotle, s, mind, rather, they, like, everything, else, in, the, visible, world, are, composed, of, the, basic, principles, matter, and, form, for, my, definition, of, matter, is, just, this, the, primary, substratum, of, each, thing, from, which, it, comes, to, be, without, qualification, and, which, persists, in, the, result, the, word, aristotle, uses, for, matter, hyle, or, hule, can, be, literally, translated, as, wood, or, timber, that, is, raw, material, for, building, indeed, aristotle, s, conception, of, matter, is, intrinsically, linked, to, something, being, made, or, composed, in, other, words, in, contrast, to, the, early, modern, conception, of, matter, as, simply, occupying, space, matter, for, aristotle, is, definitionally, linked, to, process, or, change, matter, is, what, underlies, a, change, of, substance, for, example, a, horse, eats, grass, the, horse, changes, the, grass, into, itself, the, grass, as, such, does, not, persist, in, the, horse, but, some, aspect, of, it, its, matter, does, the, matter, is, not, specifically, described, e, g, as, atoms, but, consists, of, whatever, persists, in, the, change, of, substance, from, grass, to, horse, matter, in, this, understanding, does, not, exist, independently, i, e, as, a, substance, but, exists, interdependently, i, e, as, a, principle, with, form, and, only, insofar, as, it, underlies, change, it, can, be, helpful, to, conceive, of, the, relationship, of, matter, and, form, as, very, similar, to, that, between, parts, and, whole, for, aristotle, matter, as, such, can, only, receive, actuality, from, form, it, has, no, activity, or, actuality, in, itself, similar, to, the, way, that, parts, as, such, only, have, their, existence, in, a, whole, otherwise, they, would, be, independent, wholes, french, philosopher, ren, descartes, 1596, 1650, originated, the, modern, conception, of, matter, he, was, primarily, a, geometer, unlike, aristotle, who, deduced, the, existence, of, matter, from, the, physical, reality, of, change, descartes, arbitrarily, postulated, matter, to, be, an, abstract, mathematical, substance, that, occupies, space, so, extension, in, length, breadth, and, depth, constitutes, the, nature, of, bodily, substance, and, thought, constitutes, the, nature, of, thinking, substance, and, everything, else, attributable, to, body, presupposes, extension, and, is, only, a, mode, of, an, extended, thing, for, descartes, matter, has, only, the, property, of, extension, so, its, only, activity, aside, from, locomotion, is, to, exclude, other, bodies, this, is, the, mechanical, philosophy, descartes, makes, an, absolute, distinction, between, mind, which, he, defines, as, unextended, thinking, substance, and, matter, which, he, defines, as, unthinking, extended, substance, they, are, independent, things, in, contrast, aristotle, defines, matter, and, the, formal, forming, principle, as, complementary, principles, that, together, compose, one, independent, thing, substance, in, short, aristotle, defines, matter, roughly, speaking, as, what, things, are, actually, made, of, with, a, potential, independent, existence, but, descartes, elevates, matter, to, an, actual, independent, thing, in, itself, the, continuity, and, difference, between, descartes, s, and, aristotle, s, conceptions, is, noteworthy, in, both, conceptions, matter, is, passive, or, inert, in, the, respective, conceptions, matter, has, different, relationships, to, intelligence, for, aristotle, matter, and, intelligence, form, exist, together, in, an, interdependent, relationship, whereas, for, descartes, matter, and, intelligence, mind, are, definitionally, opposed, independent, substances, descartes, s, justification, for, restricting, the, inherent, qualities, of, matter, to, extension, is, its, permanence, but, his, real, criterion, is, not, permanence, which, equally, applied, to, color, and, resistance, but, his, desire, to, use, geometry, to, explain, all, material, properties, like, descartes, hobbes, boyle, and, locke, argued, that, the, inherent, properties, of, bodies, were, limited, to, extension, and, that, so, called, secondary, qualities, like, color, were, only, products, of, human, perception, english, philosopher, isaac, newton, 1643, 1727, inherited, descartes, s, mechanical, conception, of, matter, in, the, third, of, his, rules, of, reasoning, in, philosophy, newton, lists, the, universal, qualities, of, matter, as, extension, hardness, impenetrability, mobility, and, inertia, similarly, in, optics, he, conjectures, that, god, created, matter, as, solid, massy, hard, impenetrable, movable, particles, which, were, even, so, very, hard, as, never, to, wear, or, break, in, pieces, the, primary, properties, of, matter, were, amenable, to, mathematical, description, unlike, secondary, qualities, such, as, color, or, taste, like, descartes, newton, rejected, the, essential, nature, of, secondary, qualities, newton, developed, descartes, s, notion, of, matter, by, restoring, to, matter, intrinsic, properties, in, addition, to, extension, at, least, on, a, limited, basis, such, as, mass, newton, s, use, of, gravitational, force, which, worked, at, a, distance, effectively, repudiated, descartes, s, mechanics, in, which, interactions, happened, exclusively, by, contact, though, newton, s, gravity, would, seem, to, be, a, power, of, bodies, newton, himself, did, not, admit, it, to, be, an, essential, property, of, matter, carrying, the, logic, forward, more, consistently, joseph, priestley, 1733, 1804, argued, that, corporeal, properties, transcend, contact, mechanics, chemical, properties, require, the, capacity, for, attraction, he, argued, matter, has, other, inherent, powers, besides, the, so, called, primary, qualities, of, descartes, et, al, since, priestley, s, time, there, has, been, a, massive, expansion, in, knowledge, of, the, constituents, of, the, material, world, viz, molecules, atoms, subatomic, particles, in, the, 19th, century, following, the, development, of, the, periodic, table, and, of, atomic, theory, atoms, were, seen, as, being, the, fundamental, constituents, of, matter, atoms, formed, molecules, and, compounds, the, common, definition, in, terms, of, occupying, space, and, having, mass, is, in, contrast, with, most, physical, and, chemical, definitions, of, matter, which, rely, instead, upon, its, structure, and, upon, attributes, not, necessarily, related, to, volume, and, mass, at, the, turn, of, the, nineteenth, century, the, knowledge, of, matter, began, a, rapid, evolution, aspects, of, the, newtonian, view, still, held, sway, james, clerk, maxwell, discussed, matter, in, his, work, matter, and, motion, he, carefully, separates, matter, from, space, and, time, and, defines, it, in, terms, of, the, object, referred, to, in, newton, s, first, law, of, motion, however, the, newtonian, picture, was, not, the, whole, story, in, the, 19th, century, the, term, matter, was, actively, discussed, by, a, host, of, scientists, and, philosophers, and, a, brief, outline, can, be, found, in, levere, a, textbook, discussion, from, 1870, suggests, matter, is, what, is, made, up, of, atoms, three, divisions, of, matter, are, recognized, in, science, masses, molecules, and, atoms, a, mass, of, matter, is, any, portion, of, matter, appreciable, by, the, senses, a, molecule, is, the, smallest, particle, of, matter, into, which, a, body, can, be, divided, without, losing, its, identity, an, atom, is, a, still, smaller, particle, produced, by, division, of, a, molecule, rather, than, simply, having, the, attributes, of, mass, and, occupying, space, matter, was, held, to, have, chemical, and, electrical, properties, in, 1909, the, famous, physicist, j, j, thomson, 1856, 1940, wrote, about, the, constitution, of, matter, and, was, concerned, with, the, possible, connection, between, matter, and, electrical, charge, in, the, late, 19th, century, with, the, discovery, of, the, electron, and, in, the, early, 20th, century, with, the, geiger, marsden, experiment, discovery, of, the, atomic, nucleus, and, the, birth, of, particle, physics, matter, was, seen, as, made, up, of, electrons, protons, and, neutrons, interacting, to, form, atoms, there, then, developed, an, entire, literature, concerning, the, structure, of, matter, ranging, from, the, electrical, structure, in, the, early, 20th, century, to, the, more, recent, quark, structure, of, matter, introduced, as, early, as, 1992, by, jacob, with, the, remark, understanding, the, quark, structure, of, matter, has, been, one, of, the, most, important, advances, in, contemporary, physics, in, this, connection, physicists, speak, of, matter, fields, and, speak, of, particles, as, quantum, excitations, of, a, mode, of, the, matter, field, and, here, is, a, quote, from, de, sabbata, and, gasperini, with, the, word, matter, we, denote, in, this, context, the, sources, of, the, interactions, that, is, spinor, fields, like, quarks, and, leptons, which, are, believed, to, be, the, fundamental, components, of, matter, or, scalar, fields, like, the, higgs, particles, which, are, used, to, introduced, mass, in, a, gauge, theory, and, that, however, could, be, composed, of, more, fundamental, fermion, fields, protons, and, neutrons, however, are, not, indivisible, they, can, be, divided, into, quarks, and, electrons, are, part, of, a, particle, family, called, leptons, both, quarks, and, leptons, are, elementary, particles, and, were, in, 2004, seen, by, authors, of, an, undergraduate, text, as, being, the, fundamental, constituents, of, matter, these, quarks, and, leptons, interact, through, four, fundamental, forces, gravity, electromagnetism, weak, interactions, and, strong, interactions, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, is, currently, the, best, explanation, for, all, of, physics, but, despite, decades, of, efforts, gravity, cannot, yet, be, accounted, for, at, the, quantum, level, it, is, only, described, by, classical, physics, see, quantum, gravity, and, graviton, to, the, frustration, of, theoreticians, like, stephen, hawking, interactions, between, quarks, and, leptons, are, the, result, of, an, exchange, of, force, carrying, particles, such, as, photons, between, quarks, and, leptons, the, force, carrying, particles, are, not, themselves, building, blocks, as, one, consequence, mass, and, energy, which, to, our, present, knowledge, cannot, be, created, or, destroyed, cannot, always, be, related, to, matter, which, can, be, created, out, of, non, matter, particles, such, as, photons, or, even, out, of, pure, energy, such, as, kinetic, energy, force, mediators, are, usually, not, considered, matter, the, mediators, of, the, electric, force, photons, possess, energy, see, planck, relation, and, the, mediators, of, the, weak, force, w, and, z, bosons, have, mass, but, neither, are, considered, matter, either, however, while, these, quanta, are, not, considered, matter, they, do, contribute, to, the, total, mass, of, atoms, subatomic, particles, and, all, systems, that, contain, them, the, modern, conception, of, matter, has, been, refined, many, times, in, history, in, light, of, the, improvement, in, knowledge, of, just, what, the, basic, building, blocks, are, and, in, how, they, interact, the, term, matter, is, used, throughout, physics, in, a, wide, variety, of, contexts, for, example, one, refers, to, condensed, matter, physics, elementary, matter, partonic, matter, dark, matter, anti, matter, strange, matter, and, nuclear, matter, in, discussions, of, matter, and, antimatter, the, former, has, been, referred, to, by, alfv, n, as, koinomatter, gk, common, matter, it, is, fair, to, say, that, in, physics, there, is, no, broad, consensus, as, to, a, general, definition, of, matter, and, the, term, matter, usually, is, used, in, conjunction, with, a, specifying, modifier, the, history, of, the, concept, of, matter, is, a, history, of, the, fundamental, length, scales, used, to, define, matter, different, building, blocks, apply, depending, upon, whether, one, defines, matter, on, an, atomic, or, elementary, particle, level, one, may, use, a, definition, that, matter, is, atoms, or, that, matter, is, hadrons, or, that, matter, is, leptons, and, quarks, depending, upon, the, scale, at, which, one, wishes, to, define, matter, these, quarks, and, leptons, interact, through, four, fundamental, forces, gravity, electromagnetism, weak, interactions, and, strong, interactions, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, is, currently, the, best, explanation, for, all, of, physics, but, despite, decades, of, efforts, gravity, cannot, yet, be, accounted, for, at, the, quantum, level, it, is, only, described, by, classical, physics, see, quantum, gravity, and, graviton, antimatter, cosmology, dark, matter, philosophy, other
