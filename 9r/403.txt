cerium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, ce, and, atomic, number, 58, it, is, a, soft, ductile, and, silvery, white, metal, that, tarnishes, when, exposed, to, air, cerium, is, the, second, element, in, the, lanthanide, series, and, while, it, often, shows, the, oxidation, state, of, 3, characteristic, of, the, series, it, also, has, a, stable, 4, state, that, does, not, oxidize, water, it, is, considered, one, of, the, rare, earth, elements, cerium, has, no, known, biological, role, in, humans, but, is, not, particularly, toxic, except, with, intense, or, continued, exposure, despite, always, occurring, in, combination, with, the, other, rare, earth, elements, in, minerals, such, as, those, of, the, monazite, and, bastn, site, groups, cerium, is, easy, to, extract, from, its, ores, as, it, can, be, distinguished, among, the, lanthanides, by, its, unique, ability, to, be, oxidized, to, the, 4, state, in, aqueous, solution, it, is, the, most, common, of, the, lanthanides, followed, by, neodymium, lanthanum, and, praseodymium, its, estimated, abundance, in, the, earth, s, crust, is, 68, ppm, cerium, was, the, first, of, the, lanthanides, to, be, discovered, in, bastn, s, sweden, it, was, discovered, by, j, ns, jakob, berzelius, and, wilhelm, hisinger, in, 1803, and, independently, by, martin, heinrich, klaproth, in, germany, in, the, same, year, in, 1839, carl, gustaf, mosander, became, the, first, to, isolate, the, metal, today, cerium, and, its, compounds, have, a, variety, of, uses, for, example, cerium, iv, oxide, is, used, to, polish, glass, and, is, an, important, part, of, catalytic, converters, cerium, metal, is, used, in, ferrocerium, lighters, for, its, pyrophoric, properties, cerium, doped, yag, phosphor, is, used, in, conjunction, with, blue, light, emitting, diodes, to, produce, white, light, in, most, commercial, white, led, light, sources, cerium, is, the, second, element, of, the, lanthanide, series, in, the, periodic, table, it, appears, between, the, lanthanides, lanthanum, to, its, left, and, praseodymium, to, its, right, and, above, the, actinide, thorium, it, is, a, ductile, metal, with, a, hardness, similar, to, that, of, silver, its, 58, electrons, are, arranged, in, the, configuration, 4f, 1, 5d, 1, 6s, 2, of, which, the, four, outer, electrons, are, valence, electrons, the, 4f, 5d, and, 6s, energy, levels, are, very, close, to, each, other, and, the, transfer, of, one, electron, to, the, 5d, shell, is, due, to, strong, interelectronic, repulsion, in, the, compact, 4f, shell, this, effect, is, overwhelmed, when, the, atom, is, positively, ionised, thus, ce, 2, on, its, own, has, instead, the, regular, configuration, 4f, 2, although, in, some, solid, solutions, it, may, be, 4f, 1, 5d, 1, most, lanthanides, can, use, only, three, electrons, as, valence, electrons, as, afterwards, the, remaining, 4f, electrons, are, too, strongly, bound, cerium, is, an, exception, because, of, the, stability, of, the, empty, f, shell, in, ce, 4, and, the, fact, that, it, comes, very, early, in, the, lanthanide, series, where, the, nuclear, charge, is, still, low, enough, until, neodymium, to, allow, the, removal, of, the, fourth, valence, electron, by, chemical, means, cerium, has, a, variable, electronic, structure, the, energy, of, the, 4f, electron, is, nearly, the, same, as, that, of, the, outer, 5d, and, 6s, electrons, that, are, delocalized, in, the, metallic, state, and, only, a, small, amount, of, energy, is, required, to, change, the, relative, occupancy, of, these, electronic, levels, this, gives, rise, to, dual, valence, states, for, example, a, volume, change, of, about, 10, occurs, when, cerium, is, subjected, to, high, pressures, or, low, temperatures, it, appears, that, the, valence, changes, from, about, 3, to, 4, when, it, is, cooled, or, compressed, like, the, other, lanthanides, cerium, metal, is, a, good, reducing, agent, having, standard, reduction, potential, of, e, 2, 34, v, for, the, ce, 3, ce, couple, it, tarnishes, in, air, forming, a, passivating, oxide, layer, like, iron, rust, a, centimeter, sized, sample, of, cerium, metal, corrodes, completely, in, about, a, year, more, dramatically, metallic, cerium, can, be, highly, pyrophoric, being, highly, electropositive, cerium, reacts, with, water, the, reaction, is, slow, with, cold, water, but, speeds, up, with, increasing, temperature, producing, cerium, iii, hydroxide, and, hydrogen, gas, four, allotropic, forms, of, cerium, are, known, to, exist, at, standard, pressure, and, are, given, the, common, labels, of, to, at, lower, temperatures, the, behavior, of, cerium, is, complicated, by, the, slow, rates, of, transformation, transformation, temperatures, are, subject, to, substantial, hysteresis, and, values, quoted, here, are, approximate, upon, cooling, below, 15, c, cerium, starts, to, change, to, cerium, but, the, transformation, involves, a, volume, increase, and, as, more, forms, the, internal, stresses, build, up, and, suppress, further, transformation, cooling, below, approximately, 160, c, will, start, formation, of, cerium, but, this, is, only, from, remaining, cerium, cerium, does, not, significantly, transform, to, cerium, except, in, the, presence, of, stress, or, deformation, at, atmospheric, pressure, liquid, cerium, is, more, dense, than, its, solid, form, at, the, melting, point, naturally, occurring, cerium, is, made, up, of, four, isotopes, 136, ce, 0, 19, 138, ce, 0, 25, 140, ce, 88, 4, and, 142, ce, 11, 1, all, four, are, observationally, stable, though, the, light, isotopes, 136, ce, and, 138, ce, are, theoretically, expected, to, undergo, double, electron, capture, to, isotopes, of, barium, and, the, heaviest, isotope, 142, ce, is, expected, to, undergo, double, beta, decay, to, 142, nd, or, alpha, decay, to, 138, ba, thus, 140, ce, is, the, only, theoretically, stable, isotope, none, of, these, decay, modes, have, yet, been, observed, though, the, double, beta, decay, of, 136, ce, 138, ce, and, 142, ce, have, been, experimentally, searched, for, the, current, experimental, limits, for, their, half, lives, are, all, other, cerium, isotopes, are, synthetic, and, radioactive, the, most, stable, of, them, are, 144, ce, with, a, half, life, of, 284, 9, days, 139, ce, with, a, half, life, of, 137, 6, days, and, 141, ce, with, a, half, life, of, 32, 5, days, all, other, radioactive, cerium, isotopes, have, half, lives, under, four, days, and, most, of, them, have, half, lives, under, ten, minutes, the, isotopes, between, 140, ce, and, 144, ce, inclusive, occur, as, fission, products, of, uranium, the, primary, decay, mode, of, the, isotopes, lighter, than, 140, ce, is, inverse, beta, decay, or, electron, capture, to, isotopes, of, lanthanum, while, that, of, the, heavier, isotopes, is, beta, decay, to, isotopes, of, praseodymium, some, isotopes, of, neodymium, can, alpha, decay, or, are, predicted, to, decay, to, isotopes, of, cerium, the, rarity, of, the, proton, rich, 136, ce, and, 138, ce, is, explained, by, the, fact, that, they, cannot, be, made, in, the, most, common, processes, of, stellar, nucleosynthesis, for, elements, beyond, iron, the, s, process, slow, neutron, capture, and, the, r, process, rapid, neutron, capture, this, is, so, because, they, are, bypassed, by, the, reaction, flow, of, the, s, process, and, the, r, process, nuclides, are, blocked, from, decaying, to, them, by, more, neutron, rich, stable, nuclides, such, nuclei, are, called, p, nuclei, and, their, origin, is, not, yet, well, understood, some, speculated, mechanisms, for, their, formation, include, proton, capture, as, well, as, photodisintegration, 140, ce, is, the, most, common, isotope, of, cerium, as, it, can, be, produced, in, both, the, s, and, r, processes, while, 142, ce, can, only, be, produced, in, the, r, process, another, reason, for, the, abundance, of, 140, ce, is, that, it, is, a, magic, nucleus, having, a, closed, neutron, shell, it, has, 82, neutrons, and, hence, it, has, a, very, low, cross, section, towards, further, neutron, capture, although, its, proton, number, of, 58, is, not, magic, it, is, granted, additional, stability, as, its, eight, additional, protons, past, the, magic, number, 50, enter, and, complete, the, 1g, 7, 2, proton, orbital, the, abundances, of, the, cerium, isotopes, may, differ, very, slightly, in, natural, sources, because, 138, ce, and, 140, ce, are, the, daughters, of, the, long, lived, primordial, radionuclides, 138, la, and, 144, nd, respectively, cerium, exists, in, two, main, oxidation, states, ce, iii, and, ce, iv, this, pair, of, adjacent, oxidation, states, dominates, several, aspects, of, the, chemistry, of, this, element, cerium, iv, aqueous, solutions, may, be, prepared, by, reacting, cerium, iii, solutions, with, the, strong, oxidizing, agents, peroxodisulfate, or, bismuthate, the, value, of, e, ce, 4, ce, 3, varies, widely, depending, on, conditions, due, to, the, relative, ease, of, complexation, and, hydrolysis, with, various, anions, although, 1, 72, v, is, representative, cerium, is, the, only, lanthanide, which, has, important, aqueous, and, coordination, chemistry, in, the, 4, oxidation, state, cerium, forms, all, four, trihalides, cex, 3, x, f, cl, br, i, usually, by, reaction, of, the, oxides, with, the, hydrogen, halides, the, anhydrous, halides, are, pale, colored, paramagnetic, hygroscopic, solids, upon, hydration, the, trihalides, convert, to, complexes, containing, aquo, complexes, 3, unlike, most, lanthanides, ce, forms, a, tetrafluoride, a, white, solid, it, also, forms, a, bronze, colored, diiodide, which, has, metallic, properties, aside, from, the, binary, halide, phases, a, number, of, anionic, halide, complexes, are, known, the, fluoride, gives, the, ce, iv, derivatives, cef, 4, 8, and, cef, 2, 6, the, chloride, gives, the, orange, cecl, 2, 6, cerium, iv, oxide, ceria, has, the, fluorite, structure, similarly, to, the, dioxides, of, praseodymium, and, terbium, ceria, is, a, nonstoichiometric, compound, meaning, that, the, real, formula, is, ceo, 2, x, where, x, is, about, 0, 2, thus, the, material, is, not, perfectly, described, as, ce, iv, ceria, reduces, to, cerium, iii, oxide, with, hydrogen, gas, many, nonstoichiometric, chalcogenides, are, also, known, along, with, the, trivalent, ce, 2, z, 3, z, s, se, te, the, monochalcogenides, cez, conduct, electricity, and, would, better, be, formulated, as, ce, 3, z, 2, e, while, cez, 2, are, known, they, are, polychalcogenides, with, cerium, iii, cerium, iv, derivatives, of, s, se, and, te, are, unknown, the, compound, ceric, ammonium, nitrate, can, nh, 4, 2, is, the, most, common, cerium, compound, encountered, in, the, laboratory, the, six, nitrate, ligands, bind, as, bidentate, ligands, the, complex, 2, is, 12, coordinate, a, high, coordination, number, which, emphasizes, the, large, size, of, the, ce, 4, ion, can, is, a, popular, oxidant, in, organic, synthesis, both, as, a, stoichiometric, reagent, and, as, a, catalyst, it, is, inexpensive, stable, in, air, easily, handled, and, of, low, toxicity, it, operates, by, one, electron, redox, cerium, nitrates, also, form, 4, 3, and, 1, 1, complexes, with, 18, crown, 6, the, ratio, referring, to, that, between, the, nitrate, and, the, crown, ether, classically, can, is, a, primary, standard, for, quantitative, analysis, cerium, iv, salts, especially, cerium, iv, sulfate, are, often, used, as, standard, reagents, for, volumetric, analysis, in, cerimetric, titrations, due, to, ligand, to, metal, charge, transfer, aqueous, cerium, iv, ions, are, orange, yellow, aqueous, cerium, iv, is, metastable, in, water, and, is, a, strong, oxidizing, agent, that, oxidizes, hydrochloric, acid, to, give, chlorine, gas, in, the, belousov, zhabotinsky, reaction, cerium, oscillates, between, the, 4, and, 3, oxidation, states, to, catalyze, the, reaction, organocerium, chemistry, is, similar, to, that, of, the, other, lanthanides, often, involving, complexes, of, cyclopentadienyl, and, cyclooctatetraenyl, ligands, cerocene, ce, c, 8, h, 8, 2, adopts, the, uranocene, molecular, structure, the, 4f, electron, in, cerocene, is, poised, ambiguously, between, being, localized, and, delocalized, and, this, compound, is, considered, intermediate, valent, alkyl, alkynyl, and, alkenyl, organocerium, derivatives, are, prepared, from, the, transmetallation, of, the, respective, organolithium, or, grignard, reagents, and, are, more, nucleophilic, but, less, basic, than, their, precursors, cerium, was, discovered, in, bastn, s, in, sweden, by, j, ns, jakob, berzelius, and, wilhelm, hisinger, and, independently, in, germany, by, martin, heinrich, klaproth, both, in, 1803, cerium, was, named, by, berzelius, after, the, asteroid, ceres, formally, 1, ceres, discovered, two, years, earlier, ceres, was, initially, considered, to, be, a, planet, at, the, time, the, asteroid, is, itself, named, after, the, roman, goddess, ceres, goddess, of, agriculture, grain, crops, fertility, and, motherly, relationships, cerium, was, originally, isolated, in, the, form, of, its, oxide, which, was, named, ceria, a, term, that, is, still, used, the, metal, itself, was, too, electropositive, to, be, isolated, by, then, current, smelting, technology, a, characteristic, of, rare, earth, metals, in, general, after, the, development, of, electrochemistry, by, humphry, davy, five, years, later, the, earths, soon, yielded, the, metals, they, contained, ceria, as, isolated, in, 1803, contained, all, of, the, lanthanides, present, in, the, cerite, ore, from, bastn, s, sweden, and, thus, only, contained, about, 45, of, what, is, now, known, to, be, pure, ceria, it, was, not, until, carl, gustaf, mosander, succeeded, in, removing, lanthana, and, didymia, in, the, late, 1830s, that, ceria, was, obtained, pure, wilhelm, hisinger, was, a, wealthy, mine, owner, and, amateur, scientist, and, sponsor, of, berzelius, he, owned, and, controlled, the, mine, at, bastn, s, and, had, been, trying, for, years, to, find, out, the, composition, of, the, abundant, heavy, gangue, rock, the, tungsten, of, bastn, s, which, despite, its, name, contained, no, tungsten, now, known, as, cerite, that, he, had, in, his, mine, mosander, and, his, family, lived, for, many, years, in, the, same, house, as, berzelius, and, mosander, was, undoubtedly, persuaded, by, berzelius, to, investigate, ceria, further, the, element, played, a, role, in, the, manhattan, project, where, cerium, compounds, were, investigated, in, the, berkeley, site, as, materials, for, crucibles, for, uranium, and, plutonium, casting, for, this, reason, new, methods, for, the, preparation, and, casting, of, cerium, were, developed, within, the, scope, of, the, ames, daughter, project, now, the, ames, laboratory, production, of, extremely, pure, cerium, in, ames, commenced, in, mid, 1944, and, continued, until, august, 1945, cerium, is, the, most, abundant, of, all, the, lanthanides, and, the, 25th, most, abundant, element, making, up, 68, ppm, of, the, earth, s, crust, this, value, is, the, same, of, copper, and, cerium, is, even, more, abundant, than, common, metals, such, as, lead, 13, ppm, and, tin, 2, 1, ppm, thus, despite, its, position, as, one, of, the, so, called, rare, earth, metals, cerium, is, actually, not, rare, at, all, cerium, content, in, the, soil, varies, between, 2, and, 150, ppm, with, an, average, of, 50, ppm, seawater, contains, 1, 5, parts, per, trillion, of, cerium, cerium, occurs, in, various, minerals, but, the, most, important, commercial, sources, are, the, minerals, of, the, monazite, and, bastn, site, groups, where, it, makes, up, about, half, of, the, lanthanide, content, monazite, ce, is, the, most, common, representative, of, the, monazites, with, ce, being, the, levinson, suffix, informing, on, the, dominance, of, the, particular, ree, element, representative, also, the, cerium, dominant, bastn, site, ce, is, the, most, important, of, the, bastn, sites, cerium, is, the, easiest, lanthanide, to, extract, from, its, minerals, because, it, is, the, only, one, that, can, reach, a, stable, 4, oxidation, state, in, aqueous, solution, because, of, the, decreased, solubility, of, cerium, in, the, 4, oxidation, state, cerium, is, sometimes, depleted, from, rocks, relative, to, the, other, rare, earth, elements, and, is, incorporated, into, zircon, since, ce, 4, and, zr, 4, have, the, same, charge, and, similar, ionic, radii, in, extreme, cases, cerium, iv, can, form, its, own, minerals, separated, from, the, other, rare, earth, elements, such, as, cerianite, ce, and, ce, th, o, 2, bastn, site, ln, iii, co, 3, f, is, usually, lacking, in, thorium, and, the, heavy, lanthanides, beyond, samarium, and, europium, and, hence, the, extraction, of, cerium, from, it, is, quite, direct, first, the, bastn, site, is, purified, using, dilute, hydrochloric, acid, to, remove, calcium, carbonate, impurities, the, ore, is, then, roasted, in, the, air, to, oxidize, it, to, the, lanthanide, oxides, while, most, of, the, lanthanides, will, be, oxidized, to, the, sesquioxides, ln, 2, o, 3, cerium, will, be, oxidized, to, the, dioxide, ceo, 2, this, is, insoluble, in, water, and, can, be, leached, out, with, 0, 5, m, hydrochloric, acid, leaving, the, other, lanthanides, behind, the, procedure, for, monazite, ln, th, po, 4, which, usually, contains, all, the, rare, earths, as, well, as, thorium, is, more, involved, monazite, because, of, its, magnetic, properties, can, be, separated, by, repeated, electromagnetic, separation, after, separation, it, is, treated, with, hot, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, to, produce, water, soluble, sulfates, of, rare, earths, the, acidic, filtrates, are, partially, neutralized, with, sodium, hydroxide, to, ph, 3, 4, thorium, precipitates, out, of, solution, as, hydroxide, and, is, removed, after, that, the, solution, is, treated, with, ammonium, oxalate, to, convert, rare, earths, to, their, insoluble, oxalates, the, oxalates, are, converted, to, oxides, by, annealing, the, oxides, are, dissolved, in, nitric, acid, but, cerium, oxide, is, insoluble, in, hno, 3, and, hence, precipitates, out, care, must, be, taken, when, handling, some, of, the, residues, as, they, contain, 228, ra, the, daughter, of, 232, th, which, is, a, strong, gamma, emitter, cerium, has, two, main, applications, both, of, which, use, ceo, 2, the, industrial, application, of, ceria, is, for, polishing, especially, chemical, mechanical, planarization, cmp, in, its, other, main, application, ceo, 2, is, used, to, decolorize, glass, it, functions, by, converting, green, tinted, ferrous, impurities, to, nearly, colorless, ferric, oxides, ceria, has, also, been, used, as, a, substitute, for, its, radioactive, congener, thoria, for, example, in, the, manufacture, of, electrodes, used, in, gas, tungsten, arc, welding, where, ceria, as, an, alloying, element, improves, arc, stability, and, ease, of, starting, while, decreasing, burn, off, the, first, use, of, cerium, was, in, gas, mantles, invented, by, austrian, chemist, carl, auer, von, welsbach, in, 1885, he, had, previously, experimented, with, mixtures, of, magnesium, lanthanum, and, yttrium, oxides, but, these, gave, green, tinted, light, and, were, unsuccessful, six, years, later, he, discovered, that, pure, thorium, oxide, produced, a, much, better, though, blue, light, and, that, mixing, it, with, cerium, dioxide, resulted, in, a, bright, white, light, cerium, dioxide, also, acts, as, a, catalyst, for, the, combustion, of, thorium, oxide, this, resulted, in, commercial, success, for, von, welsbach, and, his, invention, and, created, great, demand, for, thorium, its, production, resulted, in, a, large, amount, of, lanthanides, being, simultaneously, extracted, as, by, products, applications, were, soon, found, for, them, especially, in, the, pyrophoric, alloy, known, as, mischmetal, composed, of, 50, cerium, 25, lanthanum, and, the, remainder, being, the, other, lanthanides, that, is, used, widely, for, lighter, flints, usually, iron, is, added, to, form, the, alloy, ferrocerium, also, invented, by, von, welsbach, due, to, the, chemical, similarities, of, the, lanthanides, chemical, separation, is, not, usually, required, for, their, applications, such, as, the, addition, of, mischmetal, to, steel, as, an, inclusion, modifier, to, improve, mechanical, properties, or, as, catalysts, for, the, cracking, of, petroleum, this, property, of, cerium, saved, the, life, of, writer, primo, levi, at, the, auschwitz, concentration, camp, when, he, found, a, supply, of, ferrocerium, alloy, and, bartered, it, for, food, the, photostability, of, pigments, can, be, enhanced, by, the, addition, of, cerium, as, it, provides, pigments, with, lightfastness, and, prevents, clear, polymers, from, darkening, in, sunlight, an, example, of, a, cerium, compound, used, on, its, own, as, an, inorganic, pigment, is, the, vivid, red, cerium, iii, sulfide, cerium, sulfide, red, which, stays, chemically, inert, up, to, very, high, temperatures, the, pigment, is, a, safer, alternative, to, lightfast, but, toxic, cadmium, selenide, based, pigments, the, addition, of, cerium, oxide, to, older, cathode, ray, tube, television, glass, plates, was, beneficial, as, it, suppresses, the, darkening, effect, from, the, creation, of, f, center, defects, due, to, the, continuous, electron, bombardment, during, operation, cerium, is, also, an, essential, component, as, a, dopant, for, phosphors, used, in, crt, tv, screens, fluorescent, lamps, and, later, white, light, emitting, diodes, the, most, commonly, used, example, is, cerium, iii, doped, yttrium, aluminium, garnet, ce, yag, which, emits, green, to, yellow, green, light, 550, 530, nm, and, also, behaves, as, a, scintillator, cerium, salts, such, as, the, sulfides, ce, 2, s, 3, and, ce, 3, s, 4, were, considered, during, the, manhattan, project, as, advanced, refractory, materials, for, the, construction, of, crucibles, which, could, withstand, the, high, temperatures, and, strongly, reducing, conditions, when, casting, plutonium, metal, despite, desirable, properties, these, sulfides, were, never, widely, adopted, due, to, practical, issues, with, their, synthesis, cerium, is, used, as, alloying, element, in, aluminium, to, create, castable, eutectic, aluminium, alloys, with, 6, 16, wt, ce, to, which, other, elements, such, as, mg, ni, fe, and, mn, can, be, added, these, al, ce, alloys, have, excellent, high, temperature, strength, and, are, suitable, for, automotive, applications, e, g, in, cylinder, heads, other, alloys, of, cerium, include, pu, ce, and, pu, ce, co, plutonium, alloys, which, have, been, used, as, nuclear, fuel, other, automotive, applications, for, the, lower, sesquioxide, are, as, a, catalytic, converter, for, the, oxidation, of, co, and, no, x, emissions, in, the, exhaust, gases, from, motor, vehicles, the, early, lanthanides, have, been, found, to, be, essential, to, some, methanotrophic, bacteria, living, in, volcanic, mudpots, such, as, methylacidiphilum, fumariolicum, lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and, neodymium, are, about, equally, effective, cerium, is, otherwise, not, known, to, have, biological, role, in, any, other, organisms, but, is, not, very, toxic, either, it, does, not, accumulate, in, the, food, chain, to, any, appreciable, extent, because, it, often, occurs, together, with, calcium, in, phosphate, minerals, and, bones, are, primarily, calcium, phosphate, cerium, can, accumulate, in, bones, in, small, amounts, that, are, not, considered, dangerous, cerium, nitrate, is, an, effective, topical, antimicrobial, treatment, for, third, degree, burns, although, large, doses, can, lead, to, cerium, poisoning, and, methemoglobinemia, the, early, lanthanides, act, as, essential, cofactors, for, the, methanol, dehydrogenase, of, the, methanotrophic, bacterium, methylacidiphilum, fumariolicum, solv, for, which, lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and, neodymium, alone, are, about, equally, effective, like, all, rare, earth, metals, cerium, is, of, low, to, moderate, toxicity, a, strong, reducing, agent, it, ignites, spontaneously, in, air, at, 65, to, 80, c, fumes, from, cerium, fires, are, toxic, cerium, reacts, with, water, to, produce, hydrogen, gas, and, thus, cerium, fires, can, only, be, effectively, extinguished, using, class, d, dry, powder, extinguishing, media, workers, exposed, to, cerium, have, experienced, itching, sensitivity, to, heat, and, skin, lesions, cerium, is, not, toxic, when, eaten, but, animals, injected, with, large, doses, of, cerium, have, died, due, to, cardiovascular, collapse, cerium, is, more, dangerous, to, aquatic, organisms, because, it, damages, cell, membranes, it, is, not, very, soluble, in, water, and, can, cause, environmental, contamination, cerium, oxide, the, most, prevalent, cerium, compound, in, industrial, applications, is, not, regulated, in, the, united, states, by, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, as, a, hazardous, substance, in, russia, its, occupational, exposure, limit, is, 5, mg, m, 3, elemental, cerium, has, no, established, occupational, or, permissible, exposure, limits, by, the, by, the, osha, or, american, conference, of, governmental, industrial, hygienists, though, it, is, classified, as, a, flammable, solid, and, regulated, as, such, under, the, globally, harmonized, system, of, classification, and, labelling, of, chemicals, toxicological, reports, on, cerium, compounds, have, noted, their, cytotoxicity, and, contributions, to, pulmonary, interstitial, fibrosis, in, workers
