polarization, also, polarisation, is, a, property, of, transverse, waves, which, specifies, the, geometrical, orientation, of, the, oscillations, in, a, transverse, wave, the, direction, of, the, oscillation, is, perpendicular, to, the, direction, of, motion, of, the, wave, a, simple, example, of, a, polarized, transverse, wave, is, vibrations, traveling, along, a, taut, string, see, image, for, example, in, a, musical, instrument, like, a, guitar, string, depending, on, how, the, string, is, plucked, the, vibrations, can, be, in, a, vertical, direction, horizontal, direction, or, at, any, angle, perpendicular, to, the, string, in, contrast, in, longitudinal, waves, such, as, sound, waves, in, a, liquid, or, gas, the, displacement, of, the, particles, in, the, oscillation, is, always, in, the, direction, of, propagation, so, these, waves, do, not, exhibit, polarization, transverse, waves, that, exhibit, polarization, include, electromagnetic, waves, such, as, light, and, radio, waves, gravitational, waves, and, transverse, sound, waves, shear, waves, in, solids, an, electromagnetic, wave, such, as, light, consists, of, a, coupled, oscillating, electric, field, and, magnetic, field, which, are, always, perpendicular, to, each, other, by, convention, the, polarization, of, electromagnetic, waves, refers, to, the, direction, of, the, electric, field, in, linear, polarization, the, fields, oscillate, in, a, single, direction, in, circular, or, elliptical, polarization, the, fields, rotate, at, a, constant, rate, in, a, plane, as, the, wave, travels, either, in, the, right, hand, or, in, the, left, hand, direction, light, or, other, electromagnetic, radiation, from, many, sources, such, as, the, sun, flames, and, incandescent, lamps, consists, of, short, wave, trains, with, an, equal, mixture, of, polarizations, this, is, called, unpolarized, light, polarized, light, can, be, produced, by, passing, unpolarized, light, through, a, polarizer, which, allows, waves, of, only, one, polarization, to, pass, through, the, most, common, optical, materials, do, not, affect, the, polarization, of, light, but, some, materials, those, that, exhibit, birefringence, dichroism, or, optical, activity, affect, light, differently, depending, on, its, polarization, some, of, these, are, used, to, make, polarizing, filters, light, also, becomes, partially, polarized, when, it, reflects, at, an, angle, from, a, surface, according, to, quantum, mechanics, electromagnetic, waves, can, also, be, viewed, as, streams, of, particles, called, photons, when, viewed, in, this, way, the, polarization, of, an, electromagnetic, wave, is, determined, by, a, quantum, mechanical, property, of, photons, called, their, spin, a, photon, has, one, of, two, possible, spins, it, can, either, spin, in, a, right, hand, sense, or, a, left, hand, sense, about, its, direction, of, travel, circularly, polarized, electromagnetic, waves, are, composed, of, photons, with, only, one, type, of, spin, either, right, or, left, hand, linearly, polarized, waves, consist, of, photons, that, are, in, a, superposition, of, right, and, left, circularly, polarized, states, with, equal, amplitude, and, phases, synchronized, to, give, oscillation, in, a, plane, polarization, is, an, important, parameter, in, areas, of, science, dealing, with, transverse, waves, such, as, optics, seismology, radio, and, microwaves, especially, impacted, are, technologies, such, as, lasers, wireless, and, optical, fiber, telecommunications, and, radar, most, sources, of, light, are, classified, as, incoherent, and, unpolarized, or, only, partially, polarized, because, they, consist, of, a, random, mixture, of, waves, having, different, spatial, characteristics, frequencies, wavelengths, phases, and, polarization, states, however, for, understanding, electromagnetic, waves, and, polarization, in, particular, it, is, easier, to, just, consider, coherent, plane, waves, these, are, sinusoidal, waves, of, one, particular, direction, or, wavevector, frequency, phase, and, polarization, state, characterizing, an, optical, system, in, relation, to, a, plane, wave, with, those, given, parameters, can, then, be, used, to, predict, its, response, to, a, more, general, case, since, a, wave, with, any, specified, spatial, structure, can, be, decomposed, into, a, combination, of, plane, waves, its, so, called, angular, spectrum, incoherent, states, can, be, modeled, stochastically, as, a, weighted, combination, of, such, uncorrelated, waves, with, some, distribution, of, frequencies, its, spectrum, phases, and, polarizations, electromagnetic, waves, such, as, light, traveling, in, free, space, or, another, homogeneous, isotropic, non, attenuating, medium, are, properly, described, as, transverse, waves, meaning, that, a, plane, wave, s, electric, field, vector, e, and, magnetic, field, h, are, each, in, some, direction, perpendicular, to, or, transverse, to, the, direction, of, wave, propagation, e, and, h, are, also, perpendicular, to, each, other, by, convention, the, polarization, direction, of, an, electromagnetic, wave, is, given, by, its, electric, field, vector, considering, a, monochromatic, plane, wave, of, optical, frequency, f, light, of, vacuum, wavelength, has, a, frequency, of, f, c, where, c, is, the, speed, of, light, let, us, take, the, direction, of, propagation, as, the, z, axis, being, a, transverse, wave, the, e, and, h, fields, must, then, contain, components, only, in, the, x, and, y, directions, whereas, e, z, h, z, 0, using, complex, or, phasor, notation, the, instantaneous, physical, electric, and, magnetic, fields, are, given, by, the, real, parts, of, the, complex, quantities, occurring, in, the, following, equations, as, a, function, of, time, t, and, spatial, position, z, since, for, a, plane, wave, in, the, z, direction, the, fields, have, no, dependence, on, x, or, y, these, complex, fields, can, be, written, as, e, z, t, e, x, e, y, 0, e, i, 2, z, t, t, e, x, e, y, 0, e, i, k, z, t, displaystyle, vec, e, z, t, begin, bmatrix, e, x, e, y,

t, where, 0, n, is, the, wavelength, in, the, medium, whose, refractive, index, is, n, and, t, 1, f, is, the, period, of, the, wave, here, e, x, e, y, h, x, and, h, y, are, complex, numbers, in, the, second, more, compact, form, as, these, equations, are, customarily, expressed, these, factors, are, described, using, the, wavenumber, k, 2, n, 0, and, angular, frequency, or, radian, frequency, 2, f, in, a, more, general, formulation, with, propagation, not, restricted, to, the, z, direction, then, the, spatial, dependence, kz, is, replaced, by, k, r, where, k, is, called, the, wave, vector, the, magnitude, of, which, is, the, wavenumber, thus, the, leading, vectors, e, and, h, each, contain, up, to, two, nonzero, complex, components, describing, the, amplitude, and, phase, of, the, wave, s, x, and, y, polarization, components, again, there, can, be, no, z, polarization, component, for, a, transverse, wave, in, the, z, direction, for, a, given, medium, with, a, characteristic, impedance, h, is, related, to, e, by, h, y, e, x, h, x, e, y, displaystyle, begin, aligned, h, y, frac, e, x, eta, h, x, frac, e, y, eta, end, aligned, in, a, dielectric, is, real, and, has, the, value, 0, n, where, n, is, the, refractive, index, and, 0, is, the, impedance, of, free, space, the, impedance, will, be, complex, in, a, conducting, medium, note, that, given, that, relationship, the, dot, product, of, e, and, h, must, be, zero, e, r, t, h, r, t, e, x, h, x, e, y, h, y, e, z, h, z, e, x, e, y, e, y, e, x, 0, 0, 0, displaystyle, begin, aligned, vec, e, left, vec, r, t, right,

vectors, are, orthogonal, at, right, angles, to, each, other, as, expected, knowing, the, propagation, direction, z, in, this, case, and, one, can, just, as, well, specify, the, wave, in, terms, of, just, e, x, and, e, y, describing, the, electric, field, the, vector, containing, e, x, and, e, y, but, without, the, z, component, which, is, necessarily, zero, for, a, transverse, wave, is, known, as, a, jones, vector, in, addition, to, specifying, the, polarization, state, of, the, wave, a, general, jones, vector, also, specifies, the, overall, magnitude, and, phase, of, that, wave, specifically, the, intensity, of, the, light, wave, is, proportional, to, the, sum, of, the, squared, magnitudes, of, the, two, electric, field, components, i, e, x, 2, e, y, 2, 1, 2, displaystyle, i, left, left, e, x, right, 2, left, e, y, right, 2, right, frac, 1, 2, eta, however, the, wave, s, state, of, polarization, is, only, dependent, on, the, complex, ratio, of, e, y, to, e, x, so, let, us, just, consider, waves, whose, e, x, 2, e, y, 2, 1, this, happens, to, correspond, to, an, intensity, of, about, 0, 001, 33, w, m, 2, in, free, space, where, 0, and, because, the, absolute, phase, of, a, wave, is, unimportant, in, discussing, its, polarization, state, let, us, stipulate, that, the, phase, of, e, x, is, zero, in, other, words, e, x, is, a, real, number, while, e, y, may, be, complex, under, these, restrictions, e, x, and, e, y, can, be, represented, as, follows, e, x, 1, q, 2, e, y, 1, q, 2, e, i, displaystyle, begin, aligned, e, x, sqrt, frac, 1, q, 2, e, y, sqrt, frac, 1, q, 2, e, i, phi, end, aligned, where, the, polarization, state, is, now, fully, parameterized, by, the, value, of, q, such, that, 1, q, 1, and, the, relative, phase, in, addition, to, transverse, waves, there, are, many, wave, motions, where, the, oscillation, is, not, limited, to, directions, perpendicular, to, the, direction, of, propagation, these, cases, are, far, beyond, the, scope, of, the, current, article, which, concentrates, on, transverse, waves, such, as, most, electromagnetic, waves, in, bulk, media, but, one, should, be, aware, of, cases, where, the, polarization, of, a, coherent, wave, cannot, be, described, simply, using, a, jones, vector, as, we, have, just, done, just, considering, electromagnetic, waves, we, note, that, the, preceding, discussion, strictly, applies, to, plane, waves, in, a, homogeneous, isotropic, non, attenuating, medium, whereas, in, an, anisotropic, medium, such, as, birefringent, crystals, as, discussed, below, the, electric, or, magnetic, field, may, have, longitudinal, as, well, as, transverse, components, in, those, cases, the, electric, displacement, d, and, magnetic, flux, density, b, still, obey, the, above, geometry, but, due, to, anisotropy, in, the, electric, susceptibility, or, in, the, magnetic, permeability, now, given, by, a, tensor, the, direction, of, e, or, h, may, differ, from, that, of, d, or, b, even, in, isotropic, media, so, called, inhomogeneous, waves, can, be, launched, into, a, medium, whose, refractive, index, has, a, significant, imaginary, part, or, extinction, coefficient, such, as, metals, these, fields, are, also, not, strictly, transverse, 179, 184, 51, 52, surface, waves, or, waves, propagating, in, a, waveguide, such, as, an, optical, fiber, are, generally, not, transverse, waves, but, might, be, described, as, an, electric, or, magnetic, transverse, mode, or, a, hybrid, mode, even, in, free, space, longitudinal, field, components, can, be, generated, in, focal, regions, where, the, plane, wave, approximation, breaks, down, an, extreme, example, is, radially, or, tangentially, polarized, light, at, the, focus, of, which, the, electric, or, magnetic, field, respectively, is, entirely, longitudinal, along, the, direction, of, propagation, for, longitudinal, waves, such, as, sound, waves, in, fluids, the, direction, of, oscillation, is, by, definition, along, the, direction, of, travel, so, the, issue, of, polarization, is, normally, not, even, mentioned, on, the, other, hand, sound, waves, in, a, bulk, solid, can, be, transverse, as, well, as, longitudinal, for, a, total, of, three, polarization, components, in, this, case, the, transverse, polarization, is, associated, with, the, direction, of, the, shear, stress, and, displacement, in, directions, perpendicular, to, the, propagation, direction, while, the, longitudinal, polarization, describes, compression, of, the, solid, and, vibration, along, the, direction, of, propagation, the, differential, propagation, of, transverse, and, longitudinal, polarizations, is, important, in, seismology, polarization, can, be, defined, in, terms, of, pure, polarization, states, with, only, a, coherent, sinusoidal, wave, at, one, optical, frequency, the, vector, in, the, adjacent, diagram, might, describe, the, oscillation, of, the, electric, field, emitted, by, a, single, mode, laser, whose, oscillation, frequency, would, be, typically, 10, 15, times, faster, the, field, oscillates, in, the, xy, plane, along, the, page, with, the, wave, propagating, in, the, z, direction, perpendicular, to, the, page, the, first, two, diagrams, below, trace, the, electric, field, vector, over, a, complete, cycle, for, linear, polarization, at, two, different, orientations, these, are, each, considered, a, distinct, state, of, polarization, sop, the, linear, polarization, at, 45, can, also, be, viewed, as, the, addition, of, a, horizontally, linearly, polarized, wave, as, in, the, leftmost, figure, and, a, vertically, polarized, wave, of, the, same, amplitude, in, the, same, phase, now, if, one, were, to, introduce, a, phase, shift, in, between, those, horizontal, and, vertical, polarization, components, one, would, generally, obtain, elliptical, polarization, as, is, shown, in, the, third, figure, when, the, phase, shift, is, exactly, 90, and, the, amplitudes, are, the, same, then, circular, polarization, is, produced, fourth, and, fifth, figures, circular, polarization, can, be, created, by, sending, linearly, polarized, light, through, a, quarter, wave, plate, oriented, at, 45, to, the, linear, polarization, to, create, two, components, of, the, same, amplitude, with, the, required, phase, shift, the, superposition, of, the, original, and, phase, shifted, components, causes, a, rotating, electric, field, vector, which, is, depicted, in, the, animation, on, the, right, note, that, circular, or, elliptical, polarization, can, involve, either, a, clockwise, or, counterclockwise, rotation, of, the, field, depending, on, the, relative, phases, of, the, components, these, correspond, to, distinct, polarization, states, such, as, the, two, circular, polarizations, shown, above, the, orientation, of, the, x, and, y, axes, used, in, this, description, is, arbitrary, the, choice, of, such, a, coordinate, system, and, viewing, the, polarization, ellipse, in, terms, of, the, x, and, y, polarization, components, corresponds, to, the, definition, of, the, jones, vector, below, in, terms, of, those, basis, polarizations, axes, are, selected, to, suit, a, particular, problem, such, as, x, being, in, the, plane, of, incidence, since, there, are, separate, reflection, coefficients, for, the, linear, polarizations, in, and, orthogonal, to, the, plane, of, incidence, p, and, s, polarizations, see, below, that, choice, greatly, simplifies, the, calculation, of, a, wave, s, reflection, from, a, surface, any, pair, of, orthogonal, polarization, states, may, be, used, as, basis, functions, not, just, linear, polarizations, for, instance, choosing, right, and, left, circular, polarizations, as, basis, functions, simplifies, the, solution, of, problems, involving, circular, birefringence, optical, activity, or, circular, dichroism, for, a, purely, polarized, monochromatic, wave, the, electric, field, vector, over, one, cycle, of, oscillation, traces, out, an, ellipse, a, polarization, state, can, then, be, described, in, relation, to, the, geometrical, parameters, of, the, ellipse, and, its, handedness, that, is, whether, the, rotation, around, the, ellipse, is, clockwise, or, counter, clockwise, one, parameterization, of, the, elliptical, figure, specifies, the, orientation, angle, defined, as, the, angle, between, the, major, axis, of, the, ellipse, and, the, x, axis, along, with, the, ellipticity, a, b, the, ratio, of, the, ellipse, s, major, to, minor, axis, also, known, as, the, axial, ratio, the, ellipticity, parameter, is, an, alternative, parameterization, of, an, ellipse, s, eccentricity, e, 1, b, 2, a, 2, textstyle, e, sqrt, 1, b, 2, a, 2, or, the, ellipticity, angle, arctan, b, a, textstyle, chi, arctan, b, a, arctan, 1, textstyle, arctan, 1, varepsilon, as, is, shown, in, the, figure, the, angle, is, also, significant, in, that, the, latitude, angle, from, the, equator, of, the, polarization, state, as, represented, on, the, poincar, sphere, see, below, is, equal, to, 2, the, special, cases, of, linear, and, circular, polarization, correspond, to, an, ellipticity, of, infinity, and, unity, or, of, zero, and, 45, respectively, full, information, on, a, completely, polarized, state, is, also, provided, by, the, amplitude, and, phase, of, oscillations, in, two, components, of, the, electric, field, vector, in, the, plane, of, polarization, this, representation, was, used, above, to, show, how, different, states, of, polarization, are, possible, the, amplitude, and, phase, information, can, be, conveniently, represented, as, a, two, dimensional, complex, vector, the, jones, vector, e, a, 1, e, i, 1, a, 2, e, i, 2, displaystyle, mathbf, e, begin, bmatrix, a, 1, e, i, theta, 1, a, 2, e, i, theta, 2, end, bmatrix, here, a, 1, and, a, 2, denote, the, amplitude, of, the, wave, in, the, two, components, of, the, electric, field, vector, while, 1, and, 2, represent, the, phases, the, product, of, a, jones, vector, with, a, complex, number, of, unit, modulus, gives, a, different, jones, vector, representing, the, same, ellipse, and, thus, the, same, state, of, polarization, the, physical, electric, field, as, the, real, part, of, the, jones, vector, would, be, altered, but, the, polarization, state, itself, is, independent, of, absolute, phase, the, basis, vectors, used, to, represent, the, jones, vector, need, not, represent, linear, polarization, states, i, e, be, real, in, general, any, two, orthogonal, states, can, be, used, where, an, orthogonal, vector, pair, is, formally, defined, as, one, having, a, zero, inner, product, a, common, choice, is, left, and, right, circular, polarizations, for, example, to, model, the, different, propagation, of, waves, in, two, such, components, in, circularly, birefringent, media, see, below, or, signal, paths, of, coherent, detectors, sensitive, to, circular, polarization, regardless, of, whether, polarization, state, is, represented, using, geometric, parameters, or, jones, vectors, implicit, in, the, parameterization, is, the, orientation, of, the, coordinate, frame, this, permits, a, degree, of, freedom, namely, rotation, about, the, propagation, direction, when, considering, light, that, is, propagating, parallel, to, the, surface, of, the, earth, the, terms, horizontal, and, vertical, polarization, are, often, used, with, the, former, being, associated, with, the, first, component, of, the, jones, vector, or, zero, azimuth, angle, on, the, other, hand, in, astronomy, the, equatorial, coordinate, system, is, generally, used, instead, with, the, zero, azimuth, or, position, angle, as, it, is, more, commonly, called, in, astronomy, to, avoid, confusion, with, the, horizontal, coordinate, system, corresponding, to, due, north, another, coordinate, system, frequently, used, relates, to, the, plane, of, incidence, this, is, the, plane, made, by, the, incoming, propagation, direction, and, the, vector, perpendicular, to, the, plane, of, an, interface, in, other, words, the, plane, in, which, the, ray, travels, before, and, after, reflection, or, refraction, the, component, of, the, electric, field, parallel, to, this, plane, is, termed, p, like, parallel, and, the, component, perpendicular, to, this, plane, is, termed, s, like, from, senkrecht, german, for, perpendicular, polarized, light, with, its, electric, field, along, the, plane, of, incidence, is, thus, denoted, p, polarized, while, light, whose, electric, field, is, normal, to, the, plane, of, incidence, is, called, s, polarized, p, polarization, is, commonly, referred, to, as, transverse, magnetic, tm, and, has, also, been, termed, pi, polarized, or, polarized, or, tangential, plane, polarized, s, polarization, is, also, called, transverse, electric, te, as, well, as, sigma, polarized, or, polarized, or, sagittal, plane, polarized, degree, of, polarization, dop, is, a, quantity, used, to, describe, the, portion, of, an, electromagnetic, wave, which, is, polarized, dop, can, be, calculated, from, the, stokes, parameters, a, perfectly, polarized, wave, has, a, dop, of, 100, whereas, an, unpolarized, wave, has, a, dop, of, 0, a, wave, which, is, partially, polarized, and, therefore, can, be, represented, by, a, superposition, of, a, polarized, and, unpolarized, component, will, have, a, dop, somewhere, in, between, 0, and, 100, dop, is, calculated, as, the, fraction, of, the, total, power, that, is, carried, by, the, polarized, component, of, the, wave, dop, can, be, used, to, map, the, strain, field, in, materials, when, considering, the, dop, of, the, photoluminescence, the, polarization, of, the, photoluminescence, is, related, to, the, strain, in, a, material, by, way, of, the, given, material, s, photoelasticity, tensor, dop, is, also, visualized, using, the, poincar, sphere, representation, of, a, polarized, beam, in, this, representation, dop, is, equal, to, the, length, of, the, vector, measured, from, the, center, of, the, sphere, unpolarized, light, is, light, with, a, random, time, varying, polarization, natural, light, like, most, other, common, sources, of, visible, light, is, produced, independently, by, a, large, number, of, atoms, or, molecules, whose, emissions, are, uncorrelated, unpolarized, light, can, be, produced, from, the, incoherent, combination, of, vertical, and, horizontal, linearly, polarized, light, or, right, and, left, handed, circularly, polarized, light, conversely, the, two, constituent, linearly, polarized, states, of, unpolarized, light, cannot, form, an, interference, pattern, even, if, rotated, into, alignment, fresnel, arago, 3rd, law, a, so, called, depolarizer, acts, on, a, polarized, beam, to, create, one, in, which, the, polarization, varies, so, rapidly, across, the, beam, that, it, may, be, ignored, in, the, intended, applications, conversely, a, polarizer, acts, on, an, unpolarized, beam, or, arbitrarily, polarized, beam, to, create, one, which, is, polarized, in, a, vacuum, the, components, of, the, electric, field, propagate, at, the, speed, of, light, so, that, the, phase, of, the, wave, varies, in, space, and, time, while, the, polarization, state, does, not, that, is, the, electric, field, vector, e, of, a, plane, wave, in, the, z, direction, follows, e, z, z, t, t, e, z, t, e, i, k, c, t, z, displaystyle, mathbf, e, z, delta, z, t, delta, t, mathbf, e, z, t, e, ik, c, delta, t, delta, z, where, k, is, the, wavenumber, as, noted, above, the, instantaneous, electric, field, is, the, real, part, of, the, product, of, the, jones, vector, times, the, phase, factor, e, i, t, displaystyle, e, i, omega, t, when, an, electromagnetic, wave, interacts, with, matter, its, propagation, is, altered, according, to, the, material, s, complex, index, of, refraction, when, the, real, or, imaginary, part, of, that, refractive, index, is, dependent, on, the, polarization, state, of, a, wave, properties, known, as, birefringence, and, polarization, dichroism, or, diattenuation, respectively, then, the, polarization, state, of, a, wave, will, generally, be, altered, in, such, media, an, electromagnetic, wave, with, any, given, state, of, polarization, may, be, decomposed, into, two, orthogonally, polarized, components, that, encounter, different, propagation, constants, the, effect, of, propagation, over, a, given, path, on, those, two, components, is, most, easily, characterized, in, the, form, of, a, complex, 2, 2, transformation, matrix, j, known, as, a, jones, matrix, e, j, e, displaystyle, mathbf, e, mathbf, j, mathbf, e, the, jones, matrix, due, to, passage, through, a, transparent, material, is, dependent, on, the, propagation, distance, as, well, as, the, birefringence, the, birefringence, as, well, as, the, average, refractive, index, will, generally, be, dispersive, that, is, it, will, vary, as, a, function, of, optical, frequency, wavelength, in, the, case, of, non, birefringent, materials, however, the, 2, 2, jones, matrix, is, the, identity, matrix, multiplied, by, a, scalar, phase, factor, and, attenuation, factor, implying, no, change, in, polarization, during, propagation, for, propagation, effects, in, two, orthogonal, modes, the, jones, matrix, can, be, written, as, j, t, g, 1, 0, 0, g, 2, t, 1, displaystyle, mathbf, j, mathbf, t, begin, bmatrix, g, 1, 0, 0, g, 2, end, bmatrix, mathbf, t, 1, where, g, 1, and, g, 2, are, complex, numbers, describing, the, phase, delay, and, possibly, the, amplitude, attenuation, due, to, propagation, in, each, of, the, two, polarization, eigenmodes, t, is, a, unitary, matrix, representing, a, change, of, basis, from, these, propagation, modes, to, the, linear, system, used, for, the, jones, vectors, in, the, case, of, linear, birefringence, or, diattenuation, the, modes, are, themselves, linear, polarization, states, so, t, and, t, 1, can, be, omitted, if, the, coordinate, axes, have, been, chosen, appropriately, in, a, birefringent, substance, electromagnetic, waves, of, different, polarizations, travel, at, different, speeds, phase, velocities, as, a, result, when, unpolarized, waves, travel, through, a, plate, of, birefringent, material, one, polarization, component, has, a, shorter, wavelength, than, the, other, resulting, in, a, phase, difference, between, the, components, which, increases, the, further, the, waves, travel, through, the, material, the, jones, matrix, is, a, unitary, matrix, g, 1, g, 2, 1, media, termed, diattenuating, or, dichroic, in, the, sense, of, polarization, in, which, only, the, amplitudes, of, the, two, polarizations, are, affected, differentially, may, be, described, using, a, hermitian, matrix, generally, multiplied, by, a, common, phase, factor, in, fact, since, any, matrix, may, be, written, as, the, product, of, unitary, and, positive, hermitian, matrices, light, propagation, through, any, sequence, of, polarization, dependent, optical, components, can, be, written, as, the, product, of, these, two, basic, types, of, transformations, in, birefringent, media, there, is, no, attenuation, but, two, modes, accrue, a, differential, phase, delay, well, known, manifestations, of, linear, birefringence, that, is, in, which, the, basis, polarizations, are, orthogonal, linear, polarizations, appear, in, optical, wave, plates, retarders, and, many, crystals, if, linearly, polarized, light, passes, through, a, birefringent, material, its, state, of, polarization, will, generally, change, unless, its, polarization, direction, is, identical, to, one, of, those, basis, polarizations, since, the, phase, shift, and, thus, the, change, in, polarization, state, is, usually, wavelength, dependent, such, objects, viewed, under, white, light, in, between, two, polarizers, may, give, rise, to, colorful, effects, as, seen, in, the, accompanying, photograph, circular, birefringence, is, also, termed, optical, activity, especially, in, chiral, fluids, or, faraday, rotation, when, due, to, the, presence, of, a, magnetic, field, along, the, direction, of, propagation, when, linearly, polarized, light, is, passed, through, such, an, object, it, will, exit, still, linearly, polarized, but, with, the, axis, of, polarization, rotated, a, combination, of, linear, and, circular, birefringence, will, have, as, basis, polarizations, two, orthogonal, elliptical, polarizations, however, the, term, elliptical, birefringence, is, rarely, used, one, can, visualize, the, case, of, linear, birefringence, with, two, orthogonal, linear, propagation, modes, with, an, incoming, wave, linearly, polarized, at, a, 45, angle, to, those, modes, as, a, differential, phase, starts, to, accrue, the, polarization, becomes, elliptical, eventually, changing, to, purely, circular, polarization, 90, phase, difference, then, to, elliptical, and, eventually, linear, polarization, 180, phase, perpendicular, to, the, original, polarization, then, through, circular, again, 270, phase, then, elliptical, with, the, original, azimuth, angle, and, finally, back, to, the, original, linearly, polarized, state, 360, phase, where, the, cycle, begins, anew, in, general, the, situation, is, more, complicated, and, can, be, characterized, as, a, rotation, in, the, poincar, sphere, about, the, axis, defined, by, the, propagation, modes, examples, for, linear, blue, circular, red, and, elliptical, yellow, birefringence, are, shown, in, the, figure, on, the, left, the, total, intensity, and, degree, of, polarization, are, unaffected, if, the, path, length, in, the, birefringent, medium, is, sufficient, the, two, polarization, components, of, a, collimated, beam, or, ray, can, exit, the, material, with, a, positional, offset, even, though, their, final, propagation, directions, will, be, the, same, assuming, the, entrance, face, and, exit, face, are, parallel, this, is, commonly, viewed, using, calcite, crystals, which, present, the, viewer, with, two, slightly, offset, images, in, opposite, polarizations, of, an, object, behind, the, crystal, it, was, this, effect, that, provided, the, first, discovery, of, polarization, by, erasmus, bartholinus, in, 1669, media, in, which, transmission, of, one, polarization, mode, is, preferentially, reduced, are, called, dichroic, or, diattenuating, like, birefringence, diattenuation, can, be, with, respect, to, linear, polarization, modes, in, a, crystal, or, circular, polarization, modes, usually, in, a, liquid, devices, that, block, nearly, all, of, the, radiation, in, one, mode, are, known, as, polarizing, filters, or, simply, polarizers, this, corresponds, to, g, 2, 0, in, the, above, representation, of, the, jones, matrix, the, output, of, an, ideal, polarizer, is, a, specific, polarization, state, usually, linear, polarization, with, an, amplitude, equal, to, the, input, wave, s, original, amplitude, in, that, polarization, mode, power, in, the, other, polarization, mode, is, eliminated, thus, if, unpolarized, light, is, passed, through, an, ideal, polarizer, where, g, 1, 1, and, g, 2, 0, exactly, half, of, its, initial, power, is, retained, practical, polarizers, especially, inexpensive, sheet, polarizers, have, additional, loss, so, that, g, 1, 1, however, in, many, instances, the, more, relevant, figure, of, merit, is, the, polarizer, s, degree, of, polarization, or, extinction, ratio, which, involve, a, comparison, of, g, 1, to, g, 2, since, jones, vectors, refer, to, waves, amplitudes, rather, than, intensity, when, illuminated, by, unpolarized, light, the, remaining, power, in, the, unwanted, polarization, will, be, g, 2, g, 1, 2, of, the, power, in, the, intended, polarization, in, addition, to, birefringence, and, dichroism, in, extended, media, polarization, effects, describable, using, jones, matrices, can, also, occur, at, reflective, interface, between, two, materials, of, different, refractive, index, these, effects, are, treated, by, the, fresnel, equations, part, of, the, wave, is, transmitted, and, part, is, reflected, for, a, given, material, those, proportions, and, also, the, phase, of, reflection, are, dependent, on, the, angle, of, incidence, and, are, different, for, the, s, and, p, polarizations, therefore, the, polarization, state, of, reflected, light, even, if, initially, unpolarized, is, generally, changed, any, light, striking, a, surface, at, a, special, angle, of, incidence, known, as, brewster, s, angle, where, the, reflection, coefficient, for, p, polarization, is, zero, will, be, reflected, with, only, the, s, polarization, remaining, this, principle, is, employed, in, the, so, called, pile, of, plates, polarizer, see, figure, in, which, part, of, the, s, polarization, is, removed, by, reflection, at, each, brewster, angle, surface, leaving, only, the, p, polarization, after, transmission, through, many, such, surfaces, the, generally, smaller, reflection, coefficient, of, the, p, polarization, is, also, the, basis, of, polarized, sunglasses, by, blocking, the, s, horizontal, polarization, most, of, the, glare, due, to, reflection, from, a, wet, street, for, instance, is, removed, 348, 350, in, the, important, special, case, of, reflection, at, normal, incidence, not, involving, anisotropic, materials, there, is, no, particular, s, or, p, polarization, both, the, x, and, y, polarization, components, are, reflected, identically, and, therefore, the, polarization, of, the, reflected, wave, is, identical, to, that, of, the, incident, wave, however, in, the, case, of, circular, or, elliptical, polarization, the, handedness, of, the, polarization, state, is, thereby, reversed, since, by, convention, this, is, specified, relative, to, the, direction, of, propagation, the, circular, rotation, of, the, electric, field, around, the, x, y, axes, called, right, handed, for, a, wave, in, the, z, direction, is, left, handed, for, a, wave, in, the, z, direction, but, in, the, general, case, of, reflection, at, a, nonzero, angle, of, incidence, no, such, generalization, can, be, made, for, instance, right, circularly, polarized, light, reflected, from, a, dielectric, surface, at, a, grazing, angle, will, still, be, right, handed, but, elliptically, polarized, linear, polarized, light, reflected, from, a, metal, at, non, normal, incidence, will, generally, become, elliptically, polarized, these, cases, are, handled, using, jones, vectors, acted, upon, by, the, different, fresnel, coefficients, for, the, s, and, p, polarization, components, some, optical, measurement, techniques, are, based, on, polarization, in, many, other, optical, techniques, polarization, is, crucial, or, at, least, must, be, taken, into, account, and, controlled, such, examples, are, too, numerous, to, mention, in, engineering, the, phenomenon, of, stress, induced, birefringence, allows, for, stresses, in, transparent, materials, to, be, readily, observed, as, noted, above, and, seen, in, the, accompanying, photograph, the, chromaticity, of, birefringence, typically, creates, colored, patterns, when, viewed, in, between, two, polarizers, as, external, forces, are, applied, internal, stress, induced, in, the, material, is, thereby, observed, additionally, birefringence, is, frequently, observed, due, to, stresses, frozen, in, at, the, time, of, manufacture, this, is, famously, observed, in, cellophane, tape, whose, birefringence, is, due, to, the, stretching, of, the, material, during, the, manufacturing, process, ellipsometry, is, a, powerful, technique, for, the, measurement, of, the, optical, properties, of, a, uniform, surface, it, involves, measuring, the, polarization, state, of, light, following, specular, reflection, from, such, a, surface, this, is, typically, done, as, a, function, of, incidence, angle, or, wavelength, or, both, since, ellipsometry, relies, on, reflection, it, is, not, required, for, the, sample, to, be, transparent, to, light, or, for, its, back, side, to, be, accessible, ellipsometry, can, be, used, to, model, the, complex, refractive, index, of, a, surface, of, a, bulk, material, it, is, also, very, useful, in, determining, parameters, of, one, or, more, thin, film, layers, deposited, on, a, substrate, due, to, their, reflection, properties, not, only, are, the, predicted, magnitude, of, the, p, and, s, polarization, components, but, their, relative, phase, shifts, upon, reflection, compared, to, measurements, using, an, ellipsometer, a, normal, ellipsometer, does, not, measure, the, actual, reflection, coefficient, which, requires, careful, photometric, calibration, of, the, illuminating, beam, but, the, ratio, of, the, p, and, s, reflections, as, well, as, change, of, polarization, ellipticity, hence, the, name, induced, upon, reflection, by, the, surface, being, studied, in, addition, to, use, in, science, and, research, ellipsometers, are, used, in, situ, to, control, production, processes, for, instance, 585ff, 632, the, property, of, linear, birefringence, is, widespread, in, crystalline, minerals, and, indeed, was, pivotal, in, the, initial, discovery, of, polarization, in, mineralogy, this, property, is, frequently, exploited, using, polarization, microscopes, for, the, purpose, of, identifying, minerals, see, optical, mineralogy, for, more, details, 163, 164, sound, waves, in, solid, materials, exhibit, polarization, differential, propagation, of, the, three, polarizations, through, the, earth, is, a, crucial, in, the, field, of, seismology, horizontally, and, vertically, polarized, seismic, waves, shear, waves, are, termed, sh, and, sv, while, waves, with, longitudinal, polarization, compressional, waves, are, termed, p, waves, 48, 50, 56, 57, similarly, polarization, microscopes, can, be, used, to, aid, in, the, detection, of, foreign, matter, in, biological, tissue, slices, if, it, is, birefringent, autopsies, often, mention, a, lack, of, or, presence, of, polarizable, foreign, debris, we, have, seen, above, that, the, birefringence, of, a, type, of, crystal, is, useful, in, identifying, it, and, thus, detection, of, linear, birefringence, is, especially, useful, in, geology, and, mineralogy, linearly, polarized, light, generally, has, its, polarization, state, altered, upon, transmission, through, such, a, crystal, making, it, stand, out, when, viewed, in, between, two, crossed, polarizers, as, seen, in, the, photograph, above, likewise, in, chemistry, rotation, of, polarization, axes, in, a, liquid, solution, can, be, a, useful, measurement, in, a, liquid, linear, birefringence, is, impossible, but, there, may, be, circular, birefringence, when, a, chiral, molecule, is, in, solution, when, the, right, and, left, handed, enantiomers, of, such, a, molecule, are, present, in, equal, numbers, a, so, called, racemic, mixture, then, their, effects, cancel, out, however, when, there, is, only, one, or, a, preponderance, of, one, as, is, more, often, the, case, for, organic, molecules, a, net, circular, birefringence, or, optical, activity, is, observed, revealing, the, magnitude, of, that, imbalance, or, the, concentration, of, the, molecule, itself, when, it, can, be, assumed, that, only, one, enantiomer, is, present, this, is, measured, using, a, polarimeter, in, which, polarized, light, is, passed, through, a, tube, of, the, liquid, at, the, end, of, which, is, another, polarizer, which, is, rotated, in, order, to, null, the, transmission, of, light, through, it, 360, 365, in, many, areas, of, astronomy, the, study, of, polarized, electromagnetic, radiation, from, outer, space, is, of, great, importance, although, not, usually, a, factor, in, the, thermal, radiation, of, stars, polarization, is, also, present, in, radiation, from, coherent, astronomical, sources, e, g, hydroxyl, or, methanol, masers, and, incoherent, sources, such, as, the, large, radio, lobes, in, active, galaxies, and, pulsar, radio, radiation, which, may, it, is, speculated, sometimes, be, coherent, and, is, also, imposed, upon, starlight, by, scattering, from, interstellar, dust, apart, from, providing, information, on, sources, of, radiation, and, scattering, polarization, also, probes, the, interstellar, magnetic, field, via, faraday, rotation, 119, 124, 336, 337, the, polarization, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, is, being, used, to, study, the, physics, of, the, very, early, universe, synchrotron, radiation, is, inherently, polarized, it, has, been, suggested, that, astronomical, sources, caused, the, chirality, of, biological, molecules, on, earth, but, chirality, selection, on, inorganic, crystals, has, been, proposed, as, an, alternative, theory, unpolarized, light, after, being, reflected, by, a, specular, shiny, surface, generally, obtains, a, degree, of, polarization, this, phenomenon, was, observed, in, the, early, 1800s, by, the, mathematician, tienne, louis, malus, after, whom, malus, s, law, is, named, polarizing, sunglasses, exploit, this, effect, to, reduce, glare, from, reflections, by, horizontal, surfaces, notably, the, road, ahead, viewed, at, a, grazing, angle, wearers, of, polarized, sunglasses, will, occasionally, observe, inadvertent, polarization, effects, such, as, color, dependent, birefringent, effects, for, example, in, toughened, glass, e, g, car, windows, or, items, made, from, transparent, plastics, in, conjunction, with, natural, polarization, by, reflection, or, scattering, the, polarized, light, from, lcd, monitors, see, below, is, extremely, conspicuous, when, these, are, worn, polarization, is, observed, in, the, light, of, the, sky, as, this, is, due, to, sunlight, scattered, by, aerosols, as, it, passes, through, earth, s, atmosphere, the, scattered, light, produces, the, brightness, and, color, in, clear, skies, this, partial, polarization, of, scattered, light, can, be, used, to, darken, the, sky, in, photographs, increasing, the, contrast, this, effect, is, most, strongly, observed, at, points, on, the, sky, making, a, 90, angle, to, the, sun, polarizing, filters, use, these, effects, to, optimize, the, results, of, photographing, scenes, in, which, reflection, or, scattering, by, the, sky, is, involved, 346, 347, 495, 499, sky, polarization, has, been, used, for, orientation, in, navigation, the, pfund, sky, compass, was, used, in, the, 1950s, when, navigating, near, the, poles, of, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, when, neither, the, sun, nor, stars, were, visible, e, g, under, daytime, cloud, or, twilight, it, has, been, suggested, controversially, that, the, vikings, exploited, a, similar, device, the, sunstone, in, their, extensive, expeditions, across, the, north, atlantic, in, the, 9th, 11th, centuries, before, the, arrival, of, the, magnetic, compass, from, asia, to, europe, in, the, 12th, century, related, to, the, sky, compass, is, the, polar, clock, invented, by, charles, wheatstone, in, the, late, 19th, century, 67, 69, the, principle, of, liquid, crystal, display, lcd, technology, relies, on, the, rotation, of, the, axis, of, linear, polarization, by, the, liquid, crystal, array, light, from, the, backlight, or, the, back, reflective, layer, in, devices, not, including, or, requiring, a, backlight, first, passes, through, a, linear, polarizing, sheet, that, polarized, light, passes, through, the, actual, liquid, crystal, layer, which, may, be, organized, in, pixels, for, a, tv, or, computer, monitor, or, in, another, format, such, as, a, seven, segment, display, or, one, with, custom, symbols, for, a, particular, product, the, liquid, crystal, layer, is, produced, with, a, consistent, right, or, left, handed, chirality, essentially, consisting, of, tiny, helices, this, causes, circular, birefringence, and, is, engineered, so, that, there, is, a, 90, degree, rotation, of, the, linear, polarization, state, however, when, a, voltage, is, applied, across, a, cell, the, molecules, straighten, out, lessening, or, totally, losing, the, circular, birefringence, on, the, viewing, side, of, the, display, is, another, linear, polarizing, sheet, usually, oriented, at, 90, degrees, from, the, one, behind, the, active, layer, therefore, when, the, circular, birefringence, is, removed, by, the, application, of, a, sufficient, voltage, the, polarization, of, the, transmitted, light, remains, at, right, angles, to, the, front, polarizer, and, the, pixel, appears, dark, with, no, voltage, however, the, 90, degree, rotation, of, the, polarization, causes, it, to, exactly, match, the, axis, of, the, front, polarizer, allowing, the, light, through, intermediate, voltages, create, intermediate, rotation, of, the, polarization, axis, and, the, pixel, has, an, intermediate, intensity, displays, based, on, this, principle, are, widespread, and, now, are, used, in, the, vast, majority, of, televisions, computer, monitors, and, video, projectors, rendering, the, previous, crt, technology, essentially, obsolete, the, use, of, polarization, in, the, operation, of, lcd, displays, is, immediately, apparent, to, someone, wearing, polarized, sunglasses, often, making, the, display, unreadable, in, a, totally, different, sense, polarization, encoding, has, become, the, leading, but, not, sole, method, for, delivering, separate, images, to, the, left, and, right, eye, in, stereoscopic, displays, used, for, 3d, movies, this, involves, separate, images, intended, for, each, eye, either, projected, from, two, different, projectors, with, orthogonally, oriented, polarizing, filters, or, more, typically, from, a, single, projector, with, time, multiplexed, polarization, a, fast, alternating, polarization, device, for, successive, frames, polarized, 3d, glasses, with, suitable, polarizing, filters, ensure, that, each, eye, receives, only, the, intended, image, historically, such, systems, used, linear, polarization, encoding, because, it, was, inexpensive, and, offered, good, separation, however, circular, polarization, makes, separation, of, the, two, images, insensitive, to, tilting, of, the, head, and, is, widely, used, in, 3, d, movie, exhibition, today, such, as, the, system, from, reald, projecting, such, images, requires, screens, that, maintain, the, polarization, of, the, projected, light, when, viewed, in, reflection, such, as, silver, screens, a, normal, diffuse, white, projection, screen, causes, depolarization, of, the, projected, images, making, it, unsuitable, for, this, application, although, now, obsolete, crt, computer, displays, suffered, from, reflection, by, the, glass, envelope, causing, glare, from, room, lights, and, consequently, poor, contrast, several, anti, reflection, solutions, were, employed, to, ameliorate, this, problem, one, solution, utilized, the, principle, of, reflection, of, circularly, polarized, light, a, circular, polarizing, filter, in, front, of, the, screen, allows, for, the, transmission, of, say, only, right, circularly, polarized, room, light, now, right, circularly, polarized, light, depending, on, the, convention, used, has, its, electric, and, magnetic, field, direction, rotating, clockwise, while, propagating, in, the, z, direction, upon, reflection, the, field, still, has, the, same, direction, of, rotation, but, now, propagation, is, in, the, z, direction, making, the, reflected, wave, left, circularly, polarized, with, the, right, circular, polarization, filter, placed, in, front, of, the, reflecting, glass, the, unwanted, light, reflected, from, the, glass, will, thus, be, in, very, polarization, state, that, is, blocked, by, that, filter, eliminating, the, reflection, problem, the, reversal, of, circular, polarization, on, reflection, and, elimination, of, reflections, in, this, manner, can, be, easily, observed, by, looking, in, a, mirror, while, wearing, 3, d, movie, glasses, which, employ, left, and, right, handed, circular, polarization, in, the, two, lenses, closing, one, eye, the, other, eye, will, see, a, reflection, in, which, it, cannot, see, itself, that, lens, appears, black, however, the, other, lens, of, the, closed, eye, will, have, the, correct, circular, polarization, allowing, the, closed, eye, to, be, easily, seen, by, the, open, one, all, radio, and, microwave, antennas, used, for, transmitting, or, receiving, are, intrinsically, polarized, they, transmit, in, or, receive, signals, from, a, particular, polarization, being, totally, insensitive, to, the, opposite, polarization, in, certain, cases, that, polarization, is, a, function, of, direction, most, antennas, are, nominally, linearly, polarized, but, elliptical, and, circular, polarization, is, a, possibility, in, the, case, of, linear, polarization, the, same, kind, of, filtering, as, described, above, is, possible, in, the, case, of, elliptical, polarization, circular, polarization, is, in, reality, just, a, kind, of, elliptical, polarization, where, the, length, of, both, elasticity, factors, is, the, same, filtering, out, a, single, angle, e, g, 90, will, have, virtually, no, impact, as, the, wave, at, any, time, can, be, in, any, of, the, 360, degrees, the, vast, majority, of, antennas, are, linearly, polarized, in, fact, it, can, be, shown, from, considerations, of, symmetry, that, an, antenna, that, lies, entirely, in, a, plane, which, also, includes, the, observer, can, only, have, its, polarization, in, the, direction, of, that, plane, this, applies, to, many, cases, allowing, one, to, easily, infer, such, an, antenna, s, polarization, at, an, intended, direction, of, propagation, so, a, typical, rooftop, yagi, or, log, periodic, antenna, with, horizontal, conductors, as, viewed, from, a, second, station, toward, the, horizon, is, necessarily, horizontally, polarized, but, a, vertical, whip, antenna, or, am, broadcast, tower, used, as, an, antenna, element, again, for, observers, horizontally, displaced, from, it, will, transmit, in, the, vertical, polarization, a, turnstile, antenna, with, its, four, arms, in, the, horizontal, plane, likewise, transmits, horizontally, polarized, radiation, toward, the, horizon, however, when, that, same, turnstile, antenna, is, used, in, the, axial, mode, upwards, for, the, same, horizontally, oriented, structure, its, radiation, is, circularly, polarized, at, intermediate, elevations, it, is, elliptically, polarized, polarization, is, important, in, radio, communications, because, for, instance, if, one, attempts, to, use, a, horizontally, polarized, antenna, to, receive, a, vertically, polarized, transmission, the, signal, strength, will, be, substantially, reduced, or, under, very, controlled, conditions, reduced, to, nothing, this, principle, is, used, in, satellite, television, in, order, to, double, the, channel, capacity, over, a, fixed, frequency, band, the, same, frequency, channel, can, be, used, for, two, signals, broadcast, in, opposite, polarizations, by, adjusting, the, receiving, antenna, for, one, or, the, other, polarization, either, signal, can, be, selected, without, interference, from, the, other, especially, due, to, the, presence, of, the, ground, there, are, some, differences, in, propagation, and, also, in, reflections, responsible, for, tv, ghosting, between, horizontal, and, vertical, polarizations, am, and, fm, broadcast, radio, usually, use, vertical, polarization, while, television, uses, horizontal, polarization, at, low, frequencies, especially, horizontal, polarization, is, avoided, that, is, because, the, phase, of, a, horizontally, polarized, wave, is, reversed, upon, reflection, by, the, ground, a, distant, station, in, the, horizontal, direction, will, receive, both, the, direct, and, reflected, wave, which, thus, tend, to, cancel, each, other, this, problem, is, avoided, with, vertical, polarization, polarization, is, also, important, in, the, transmission, of, radar, pulses, and, reception, of, radar, reflections, by, the, same, or, a, different, antenna, for, instance, back, scattering, of, radar, pulses, by, rain, drops, can, be, avoided, by, using, circular, polarization, just, as, specular, reflection, of, circularly, polarized, light, reverses, the, handedness, of, the, polarization, as, discussed, above, the, same, principle, applies, to, scattering, by, objects, much, smaller, than, a, wavelength, such, as, rain, drops, on, the, other, hand, reflection, of, that, wave, by, an, irregular, metal, object, such, as, an, airplane, will, typically, introduce, a, change, in, polarization, and, partial, reception, of, the, return, wave, by, the, same, antenna, the, effect, of, free, electrons, in, the, ionosphere, in, conjunction, with, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, causes, faraday, rotation, a, sort, of, circular, birefringence, this, is, the, same, mechanism, which, can, rotate, the, axis, of, linear, polarization, by, electrons, in, interstellar, space, as, mentioned, below, the, magnitude, of, faraday, rotation, caused, by, such, a, plasma, is, greatly, exaggerated, at, lower, frequencies, so, at, the, higher, microwave, frequencies, used, by, satellites, the, effect, is, minimal, however, medium, or, short, wave, transmissions, received, following, refraction, by, the, ionosphere, are, strongly, affected, since, a, wave, s, path, through, the, ionosphere, and, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, vector, along, such, a, path, are, rather, unpredictable, a, wave, transmitted, with, vertical, or, horizontal, polarization, will, generally, have, a, resulting, polarization, in, an, arbitrary, orientation, at, the, receiver, many, animals, are, capable, of, perceiving, some, of, the, components, of, the, polarization, of, light, e, g, linear, horizontally, polarized, light, this, is, generally, used, for, navigational, purposes, since, the, linear, polarization, of, sky, light, is, always, perpendicular, to, the, direction, of, the, sun, this, ability, is, very, common, among, the, insects, including, bees, which, use, this, information, to, orient, their, communicative, dances, 102, 103, polarization, sensitivity, has, also, been, observed, in, species, of, octopus, squid, cuttlefish, and, mantis, shrimp, 111, 112, in, the, latter, case, one, species, measures, all, six, orthogonal, components, of, polarization, and, is, believed, to, have, optimal, polarization, vision, the, rapidly, changing, vividly, colored, skin, patterns, of, cuttlefish, used, for, communication, also, incorporate, polarization, patterns, and, mantis, shrimp, are, known, to, have, polarization, selective, reflective, tissue, sky, polarization, was, thought, to, be, perceived, by, pigeons, which, was, assumed, to, be, one, of, their, aids, in, homing, but, research, indicates, this, is, a, popular, myth, the, naked, human, eye, is, weakly, sensitive, to, polarization, without, the, need, for, intervening, filters, polarized, light, creates, a, very, faint, pattern, near, the, center, of, the, visual, field, called, haidinger, s, brush, this, pattern, is, very, difficult, to, see, but, with, practice, one, can, learn, to, detect, polarized, light, with, the, naked, eye, 118, it, is, well, known, that, electromagnetic, radiation, carries, a, certain, linear, momentum, in, the, direction, of, propagation, in, addition, however, light, carries, a, certain, angular, momentum, if, it, is, circularly, polarized, or, partially, so, in, comparison, with, lower, frequencies, such, as, microwaves, the, amount, of, angular, momentum, in, light, even, of, pure, circular, polarization, compared, to, the, same, wave, s, linear, momentum, or, radiation, pressure, is, very, small, and, difficult, to, even, measure, however, it, was, utilized, in, an, experiment, to, achieve, speeds, of, up, to, 600, million, revolutions, per, minute, quantum, physics, optics
