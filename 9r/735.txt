el, ni, o, southern, oscillation, enso, is, a, global, climate, phenomenon, that, emerges, from, variations, in, winds, and, sea, surface, temperatures, over, the, tropical, pacific, ocean, those, variations, have, an, irregular, pattern, but, do, have, some, semblance, of, cycles, the, occurrence, of, enso, is, not, predictable, it, affects, the, climate, of, much, of, the, tropics, and, subtropics, and, has, links, teleconnections, to, higher, latitude, regions, of, the, world, the, warming, phase, of, the, sea, surface, temperature, is, known, as, el, ni, o, and, the, cooling, phase, as, la, ni, a, the, southern, oscillation, is, the, accompanying, atmospheric, oscillation, which, is, coupled, with, the, sea, temperature, change, el, ni, o, is, associated, with, higher, than, normal, air, sea, level, pressure, over, indonesia, australia, and, across, the, indian, ocean, to, the, atlantic, la, ni, a, has, roughly, the, reverse, pattern, high, pressure, over, the, central, and, eastern, pacific, and, lower, pressure, through, much, of, the, rest, of, the, tropics, and, subtropics, the, two, phenomena, last, a, year, or, so, each, and, typically, occur, every, two, to, seven, years, with, varying, intensity, with, neutral, periods, of, lower, intensity, interspersed, el, ni, o, events, can, be, more, intense, but, la, ni, a, events, may, repeat, and, last, longer, a, key, mechanism, of, enso, is, the, bjerknes, feedback, named, after, jacob, bjerknes, in, 1969, in, which, the, atmospheric, changes, alter, the, sea, temperatures, that, in, turn, alter, the, atmospheric, winds, in, a, positive, feedback, weaker, easterly, trade, winds, result, in, a, surge, of, warm, surface, waters, to, the, east, and, reduced, ocean, upwelling, on, the, equator, in, turn, this, leads, to, warmer, sea, surface, temperatures, called, el, ni, o, a, weaker, walker, circulation, an, east, west, overturning, circulation, in, the, atmosphere, and, even, weaker, trade, winds, ultimately, the, warm, waters, in, the, western, tropical, pacific, are, depleted, enough, so, that, conditions, return, to, normal, the, exact, mechanisms, that, cause, the, oscillation, are, unclear, and, are, being, studied, each, country, that, monitors, the, enso, has, a, different, threshold, for, what, constitutes, an, el, ni, o, or, la, ni, a, event, which, is, tailored, to, their, specific, interests, el, ni, o, and, la, ni, a, affect, the, global, climate, and, disrupt, normal, weather, patterns, which, as, a, result, can, lead, to, intense, storms, in, some, places, and, droughts, in, others, el, ni, o, events, cause, short, term, approximately, 1, year, in, length, spikes, in, global, average, surface, temperature, while, la, ni, a, events, cause, short, term, surface, cooling, therefore, the, relative, frequency, of, el, ni, o, compared, to, la, ni, a, events, can, affect, global, temperature, trends, on, timescales, of, around, ten, years, the, countries, most, affected, by, enso, are, developing, countries, that, are, bordering, the, pacific, ocean, and, are, dependent, on, agriculture, and, fishing, in, climate, change, science, enso, is, known, as, one, of, the, internal, climate, variability, phenomena, 23, future, trends, in, enso, due, to, climate, change, are, uncertain, although, climate, change, exacerbates, the, effects, of, droughts, and, floods, the, ipcc, sixth, assessment, report, summarized, the, scientific, knowledge, in, 2021, for, the, future, of, enso, as, follows, in, the, long, term, it, is, very, likely, that, the, precipitation, variance, related, to, el, ni, o, southern, oscillation, will, increase, 113, the, scientific, consensus, is, also, that, it, is, very, likely, that, rainfall, variability, related, to, changes, in, the, strength, and, spatial, extent, of, enso, teleconnections, will, lead, to, significant, changes, at, regional, scale, 114, the, el, ni, o, southern, oscillation, is, a, single, climate, phenomenon, that, periodically, fluctuates, between, three, phases, neutral, la, ni, a, or, el, ni, o, la, ni, a, and, el, ni, o, are, opposite, phases, in, the, oscillation, which, are, deemed, to, occur, when, specific, ocean, and, atmospheric, conditions, are, reached, or, exceeded, an, early, recorded, mention, of, the, term, el, ni, o, the, boy, in, spanish, to, refer, to, climate, occurred, in, 1892, when, captain, camilo, carrillo, told, the, geographical, society, congress, in, lima, that, peruvian, sailors, named, the, warm, south, flowing, current, el, ni, o, because, it, was, most, noticeable, around, christmas, although, pre, columbian, societies, were, certainly, aware, of, the, phenomenon, the, indigenous, names, for, it, have, been, lost, to, history, the, capitalized, term, el, ni, o, refers, to, the, christ, child, jesus, because, periodic, warming, in, the, pacific, near, south, america, is, usually, noticed, around, christmas, originally, the, term, el, ni, o, applied, to, an, annual, weak, warm, ocean, current, that, ran, southwards, along, the, coast, of, peru, and, ecuador, at, about, christmas, time, however, over, time, the, term, has, evolved, and, now, refers, to, the, warm, and, negative, phase, of, the, el, ni, o, southern, oscillation, enso, the, original, phrase, el, ni, o, de, navidad, arose, centuries, ago, when, peruvian, fishermen, named, the, weather, phenomenon, after, the, newborn, christ, la, ni, a, the, girl, in, spanish, is, the, colder, counterpart, of, el, ni, o, as, part, of, the, broader, enso, climate, pattern, in, the, past, it, was, also, called, an, anti, el, ni, o, and, el, viejo, meaning, the, old, man, a, negative, phase, exists, when, atmospheric, pressure, over, indonesia, and, the, west, pacific, is, abnormally, high, and, pressure, over, the, east, pacific, is, abnormally, low, during, el, ni, o, episodes, and, a, positive, phase, is, when, the, opposite, occurs, during, la, ni, a, episodes, and, pressure, over, indonesia, is, low, and, over, the, west, pacific, is, high, on, average, the, temperature, of, the, ocean, surface, in, the, tropical, east, pacific, is, roughly, 8, 10, c, 14, 18, f, cooler, than, in, the, tropical, west, pacific, the, sea, surface, temperature, sst, of, the, west, pacific, northeast, of, australia, averages, around, 28, 30, c, 82, 86, f, ssts, in, the, east, pacific, off, the, western, coast, of, south, america, are, closer, to, 20, c, 68, f, strong, trade, winds, near, the, equator, push, water, away, from, the, east, pacific, and, towards, the, west, pacific, this, water, is, slowly, warmed, by, the, sun, as, it, moves, west, along, the, equator, the, ocean, surface, near, indonesia, is, typically, around, 0, 5, m, 1, 5, ft, higher, than, near, peru, because, of, the, buildup, of, water, in, the, west, pacific, the, thermocline, or, the, transitional, zone, between, the, warmer, waters, near, the, ocean, surface, and, the, cooler, waters, of, the, deep, ocean, is, pushed, downwards, in, the, west, pacific, due, to, this, water, accumulation, the, total, weight, of, a, column, of, ocean, water, is, almost, the, same, in, the, western, and, east, pacific, because, the, warmer, waters, of, the, upper, ocean, are, slightly, less, dense, than, the, cooler, deep, ocean, the, thicker, layer, of, warmer, water, in, the, western, pacific, means, the, thermocline, there, must, be, deeper, the, difference, in, weight, must, be, enough, to, drive, any, deep, water, return, flow, 12, consequently, the, thermocline, is, tilted, across, the, tropical, pacific, rising, from, an, average, depth, of, about, 140, m, 450, ft, in, the, west, pacific, to, a, depth, of, about, 30, m, 90, ft, in, the, east, pacific, cooler, deep, ocean, water, takes, the, place, of, the, outgoing, surface, waters, in, the, east, pacific, rising, to, the, ocean, surface, in, a, process, called, upwelling, along, the, western, coast, of, south, america, water, near, the, ocean, surface, is, pushed, westward, due, to, the, combination, of, the, trade, winds, and, the, coriolis, effect, this, process, is, known, as, ekman, transport, colder, water, from, deeper, in, the, ocean, rises, along, the, continental, margin, to, replace, the, near, surface, water, this, process, cools, the, east, pacific, because, the, thermocline, is, closer, to, the, ocean, surface, leaving, relatively, little, separation, between, the, deeper, cold, water, and, the, ocean, surface, additionally, the, northward, flowing, humboldt, current, carries, colder, water, from, the, southern, ocean, to, the, tropics, in, the, east, pacific, the, combination, of, the, humboldt, current, and, upwelling, maintains, an, area, of, cooler, ocean, waters, off, the, coast, of, peru, the, west, pacific, lacks, a, cold, ocean, current, and, has, less, upwelling, as, the, trade, winds, are, usually, weaker, than, in, the, east, pacific, allowing, the, west, pacific, to, reach, warmer, temperatures, these, warmer, waters, provide, energy, for, the, upward, movement, of, air, as, a, result, the, warm, west, pacific, has, on, average, more, cloudiness, and, rainfall, than, the, cool, east, pacific, enso, describes, a, quasi, periodic, change, of, both, oceanic, and, atmospheric, conditions, over, the, tropical, pacific, ocean, these, changes, affect, weather, patterns, across, much, of, the, earth, the, tropical, pacific, is, said, to, be, in, one, of, three, states, of, enso, also, called, phases, depending, on, the, atmospheric, and, oceanic, conditions, when, the, tropical, pacific, roughly, reflects, the, average, conditions, the, state, of, enso, is, said, to, be, in, the, neutral, phase, however, the, tropical, pacific, experiences, occasional, shifts, away, from, these, average, conditions, if, trade, winds, are, weaker, than, average, the, effect, of, upwelling, in, the, east, pacific, and, the, flow, of, warmer, ocean, surface, waters, towards, the, west, pacific, lessen, this, results, in, a, cooler, west, pacific, and, a, warmer, east, pacific, leading, to, a, shift, of, cloudiness, and, rainfall, towards, the, east, pacific, this, situation, is, called, el, ni, o, the, opposite, occurs, if, trade, winds, are, stronger, than, average, leading, to, a, warmer, west, pacific, and, an, cooler, east, pacific, this, situation, is, called, la, ni, a, and, is, associated, with, increased, cloudiness, and, rainfall, over, the, west, pacific, the, close, relationship, between, ocean, temperatures, and, the, strength, of, the, trade, winds, was, first, identified, by, jacob, bjerknes, in, 1969, bjerknes, also, hypothesized, that, enso, was, a, positive, feedback, system, where, the, associated, changes, in, one, component, of, the, climate, system, the, ocean, or, atmosphere, tend, to, reinforce, changes, in, the, other, 86, for, example, during, el, ni, o, the, reduced, contrast, in, ocean, temperatures, across, the, pacific, results, in, weaker, trade, winds, further, reinforcing, the, el, ni, o, state, this, process, is, known, as, bjerknes, feedback, although, these, associated, changes, in, the, ocean, and, atmosphere, often, occur, together, the, state, of, the, atmosphere, may, resemble, a, different, enso, phase, than, the, state, of, the, ocean, or, vice, versa, because, their, states, are, closely, linked, the, variations, of, enso, may, arise, from, changes, in, both, the, ocean, and, atmosphere, and, not, necessarily, from, an, initial, change, of, exclusively, one, or, the, other, conceptual, models, explaining, how, enso, operates, generally, accept, the, bjerknes, feedback, hypothesis, however, enso, would, perpetually, remain, in, one, phase, if, bjerknes, feedback, were, the, only, process, occurring, 88, several, theories, have, been, proposed, to, explain, how, enso, can, change, from, one, state, to, the, next, despite, the, positive, feedback, these, explanations, broadly, fall, under, two, categories, in, one, view, the, bjerknes, feedback, naturally, triggers, negative, feedbacks, that, end, and, reverse, the, abnormal, state, of, the, tropical, pacific, this, perspective, implies, that, the, processes, that, lead, to, el, ni, o, and, la, ni, a, also, eventually, bring, about, their, end, making, enso, a, self, sustaining, process, 88, other, theories, view, the, state, of, enso, as, being, changed, by, irregular, and, external, phenomena, such, as, the, madden, julian, oscillation, tropical, instability, waves, and, westerly, wind, bursts, 90, the, three, phases, of, enso, relate, to, the, walker, circulation, which, was, named, after, gilbert, walker, who, discovered, the, southern, oscillation, during, the, early, twentieth, century, the, walker, circulation, is, an, east, west, overturning, circulation, in, the, vicinity, of, the, equator, in, the, pacific, upward, air, is, associated, with, high, sea, temperatures, convection, and, rainfall, while, the, downward, branch, occurs, over, cooler, sea, surface, temperatures, in, the, east, during, el, ni, o, as, the, sea, surface, temperatures, change, so, does, the, walker, circulation, warming, in, the, eastern, tropical, pacific, weakens, or, reverses, the, downward, branch, while, cooler, conditions, in, the, west, lead, to, less, rain, and, downward, air, so, the, walker, circulation, first, weakens, and, may, reverse, 185, the, southern, oscillation, is, the, atmospheric, component, of, enso, this, component, is, an, oscillation, in, surface, air, pressure, between, the, tropical, eastern, and, the, western, pacific, ocean, waters, the, strength, of, the, southern, oscillation, is, measured, by, the, southern, oscillation, index, soi, the, soi, is, computed, from, fluctuations, in, the, surface, air, pressure, difference, between, tahiti, in, the, pacific, and, darwin, australia, on, the, indian, ocean, el, ni, o, episodes, have, negative, soi, meaning, there, is, lower, pressure, over, tahiti, and, higher, pressure, in, darwin, la, ni, a, episodes, on, the, other, hand, have, positive, soi, meaning, there, is, higher, pressure, in, tahiti, and, lower, in, darwin, low, atmospheric, pressure, tends, to, occur, over, warm, water, and, high, pressure, occurs, over, cold, water, in, part, because, of, deep, convection, over, the, warm, water, el, ni, o, episodes, are, defined, as, sustained, warming, of, the, central, and, eastern, tropical, pacific, ocean, thus, resulting, in, a, decrease, in, the, strength, of, the, pacific, trade, winds, and, a, reduction, in, rainfall, over, eastern, and, northern, australia, la, ni, a, episodes, are, defined, as, sustained, cooling, of, the, central, and, eastern, tropical, pacific, ocean, thus, resulting, in, an, increase, in, the, strength, of, the, pacific, trade, winds, and, the, opposite, effects, in, australia, when, compared, to, el, ni, o, although, the, southern, oscillation, index, has, a, long, station, record, going, back, to, the, 1800s, its, reliability, is, limited, due, to, the, latitudes, of, both, darwin, and, tahiti, being, well, south, of, the, equator, so, that, the, surface, air, pressure, at, both, locations, is, less, directly, related, to, enso, to, overcome, this, effect, a, new, index, was, created, named, the, equatorial, southern, oscillation, index, eqsoi, to, generate, this, index, two, new, regions, centered, on, the, equator, were, defined, the, western, region, is, located, over, indonesia, and, the, eastern, one, over, the, equatorial, pacific, close, to, the, south, american, coast, however, data, on, eqsoi, goes, back, only, to, 1949, sea, surface, height, ssh, changes, up, or, down, by, several, centimeters, in, pacific, equatorial, region, with, the, esno, el, ni, o, causes, a, positive, ssh, anomaly, raised, sea, level, because, of, thermal, expansion, while, la, ni, a, causes, a, negative, ssh, anomaly, lowered, sea, level, via, contraction, the, el, ni, o, southern, oscillation, is, a, single, climate, phenomenon, that, quasi, periodically, fluctuates, between, three, phases, neutral, la, ni, a, or, el, ni, o, la, ni, a, and, el, ni, o, are, opposite, phases, which, require, certain, changes, to, take, place, in, both, the, ocean, and, the, atmosphere, before, an, event, is, declared, the, cool, phase, of, enso, is, la, ni, a, with, sst, in, the, eastern, pacific, below, average, and, air, pressure, high, in, the, eastern, pacific, and, low, in, the, western, pacific, the, enso, cycle, including, both, el, ni, o, and, la, ni, a, causes, global, changes, in, temperature, and, rainfall, if, the, temperature, variation, from, climatology, is, within, 0, 5, c, 0, 9, f, enso, conditions, are, described, as, neutral, neutral, conditions, are, the, transition, between, warm, and, cold, phases, of, enso, sea, surface, temperatures, by, definition, tropical, precipitation, and, wind, patterns, are, near, average, conditions, during, this, phase, close, to, half, of, all, years, are, within, neutral, periods, during, the, neutral, enso, phase, other, climate, anomalies, patterns, such, as, the, sign, of, the, north, atlantic, oscillation, or, the, pacific, north, american, teleconnection, pattern, exert, more, influence, el, ni, o, conditions, are, established, when, the, walker, circulation, weakens, or, reverses, and, the, hadley, circulation, strengthens, leading, to, the, development, of, a, band, of, warm, ocean, water, in, the, central, and, east, central, equatorial, pacific, approximately, between, the, international, date, line, and, 120, w, including, the, area, off, the, west, coast, of, south, america, as, upwelling, of, cold, water, occurs, less, or, not, at, all, offshore, this, warming, causes, a, shift, in, the, atmospheric, circulation, leading, to, higher, air, pressure, in, the, western, pacific, and, lower, in, the, eastern, pacific, with, rainfall, reducing, over, indonesia, india, and, northern, australia, while, rainfall, and, tropical, cyclone, formation, increases, over, the, tropical, pacific, ocean, the, low, level, surface, trade, winds, which, normally, blow, from, east, to, west, along, the, equator, either, weaken, or, start, blowing, from, the, other, direction, el, ni, o, phases, are, known, to, happen, at, irregular, intervals, of, two, to, seven, years, and, lasts, nine, months, to, two, years, the, average, period, length, is, five, years, when, this, warming, occurs, for, seven, to, nine, months, it, is, classified, as, el, ni, o, conditions, when, its, duration, is, longer, it, is, classified, as, an, el, ni, o, episode, it, is, thought, that, there, have, been, at, least, 30, el, ni, o, events, between, 1900, and, 2024, with, the, 1982, 83, 1997, 98, and, 2014, 16, events, among, the, strongest, on, record, since, 2000, el, ni, o, events, have, been, observed, in, 2002, 03, 2004, 05, 2006, 07, 2009, 10, 2014, 16, 2018, 19, and, 2023, 24, major, enso, events, were, recorded, in, the, years, 1790, 93, 1828, 1876, 78, 1891, 1925, 26, 1972, 73, 1982, 83, 1997, 98, 2014, 16, and, 2023, 24, during, strong, el, ni, o, episodes, a, secondary, peak, in, sea, surface, temperature, across, the, far, eastern, equatorial, pacific, ocean, sometimes, follows, the, initial, peak, an, especially, strong, walker, circulation, causes, la, ni, a, which, is, considered, to, be, the, cold, oceanic, and, positive, atmospheric, phase, of, the, broader, el, ni, o, southern, oscillation, enso, weather, phenomenon, as, well, as, the, opposite, of, el, ni, o, weather, pattern, where, sea, surface, temperature, across, the, eastern, equatorial, part, of, the, central, pacific, ocean, will, be, lower, than, normal, by, 3, 5, c, 5, 4, 9, f, the, phenomenon, occurs, as, strong, winds, blow, warm, water, at, the, ocean, s, surface, away, from, south, america, across, the, pacific, ocean, towards, indonesia, as, this, warm, water, moves, west, cold, water, from, the, deep, sea, rises, to, the, surface, near, south, america, the, movement, of, so, much, heat, across, a, quarter, of, the, planet, and, particularly, in, the, form, of, temperature, at, the, ocean, surface, can, have, a, significant, effect, on, weather, across, the, entire, planet, tropical, instability, waves, visible, on, sea, surface, temperature, maps, showing, a, tongue, of, colder, water, are, often, present, during, neutral, or, la, ni, a, conditions, la, ni, a, is, a, complex, weather, pattern, that, occurs, every, few, years, often, persisting, for, longer, than, five, months, el, ni, o, and, la, ni, a, can, be, indicators, of, weather, changes, across, the, globe, atlantic, and, pacific, hurricanes, can, have, different, characteristics, due, to, lower, or, higher, wind, shear, and, cooler, or, warmer, sea, surface, temperatures, la, ni, a, events, have, been, observed, for, hundreds, of, years, and, occurred, on, a, regular, basis, during, the, early, parts, of, both, the, 17th, and, 19th, centuries, since, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, la, ni, a, events, have, occurred, during, the, following, years, transitional, phases, at, the, onset, or, departure, of, el, ni, o, or, la, ni, a, can, also, be, important, factors, on, global, weather, by, affecting, teleconnections, significant, episodes, known, as, trans, ni, o, are, measured, by, the, trans, ni, o, index, tni, examples, of, affected, short, time, climate, in, north, america, include, precipitation, in, the, northwest, us, and, intense, tornado, activity, in, the, contiguous, us, the, first, enso, pattern, to, be, recognised, called, eastern, pacific, ep, enso, to, distinguish, if, from, others, involves, temperature, anomalies, in, the, eastern, pacific, however, in, the, 1990s, and, 2000s, variations, of, enso, conditions, were, observed, in, which, the, usual, place, of, the, temperature, anomaly, ni, o, 1, and, 2, is, not, affected, but, an, anomaly, also, arises, in, the, central, pacific, ni, o, 3, 4, the, phenomenon, is, called, central, pacific, cp, enso, dateline, enso, because, the, anomaly, arises, near, the, dateline, or, enso, modoki, modoki, is, japanese, for, similar, but, different, there, are, variations, of, enso, additional, to, the, ep, and, cp, types, and, some, scientists, argue, that, enso, exists, as, a, continuum, often, with, hybrid, types, the, effects, of, the, cp, enso, are, different, from, those, of, the, ep, enso, the, el, ni, o, modoki, is, associated, with, more, hurricanes, more, frequently, making, landfall, in, the, atlantic, la, ni, a, modoki, leads, to, a, rainfall, increase, over, northwestern, australia, and, northern, murray, darling, basin, rather, than, over, the, eastern, portion, of, the, country, as, in, a, conventional, ep, la, ni, a, also, la, ni, a, modoki, increases, the, frequency, of, cyclonic, storms, over, bay, of, bengal, but, decreases, the, occurrence, of, severe, storms, in, the, indian, ocean, overall, the, first, recorded, el, ni, o, that, originated, in, the, central, pacific, and, moved, toward, the, east, was, in, 1986, recent, central, pacific, el, ni, os, happened, in, 1986, 87, 1991, 92, 1994, 95, 2002, 03, 2004, 05, and, 2009, 10, furthermore, there, were, modoki, events, in, 1957, 59, 1963, 64, 1965, 66, 1968, 70, 1977, 78, and, 1979, 80, some, sources, say, that, the, el, ni, os, of, 2006, 07, and, 2014, 16, were, also, central, pacific, el, ni, os, recent, years, when, la, ni, a, modoki, events, occurred, include, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1983, 1984, 1988, 1989, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and, 2016, 2017, the, recent, discovery, of, enso, modoki, has, some, scientists, believing, it, to, be, linked, to, global, warming, however, comprehensive, satellite, data, go, back, only, to, 1979, more, research, must, be, done, to, find, the, correlation, and, study, past, el, ni, o, episodes, more, generally, there, is, no, scientific, consensus, on, how, if, climate, change, might, affect, enso, there, is, also, a, scientific, debate, on, the, very, existence, of, this, new, enso, a, number, of, studies, dispute, the, reality, of, this, statistical, distinction, or, its, increasing, occurrence, or, both, either, arguing, the, reliable, record, is, too, short, to, detect, such, a, distinction, finding, no, distinction, or, trend, using, other, statistical, approaches, or, that, other, types, should, be, distinguished, such, as, standard, and, extreme, enso, likewise, following, the, asymmetric, nature, of, the, warm, and, cold, phases, of, enso, some, studies, could, not, identify, similar, variations, for, la, ni, a, both, in, observations, and, in, the, climate, models, but, some, sources, could, identify, variations, on, la, ni, a, with, cooler, waters, on, central, pacific, and, average, or, warmer, water, temperatures, on, both, eastern, and, western, pacific, also, showing, eastern, pacific, ocean, currents, going, to, the, opposite, direction, compared, to, the, currents, in, traditional, la, ni, as, coined, by, the, peruvian, comit, multisectorial, encargado, del, estudio, nacional, del, fen, meno, el, ni, o, enfen, enso, costero, or, enso, oriental, is, the, name, given, to, the, phenomenon, where, the, sea, surface, temperature, anomalies, are, mostly, focused, on, the, south, american, coastline, especially, from, peru, and, ecuador, studies, point, many, factors, that, can, lead, to, its, occurrence, sometimes, accompanying, or, being, accompanied, by, a, larger, ep, enso, occurrence, or, even, displaying, opposite, conditions, from, the, observed, ones, in, the, other, ni, o, regions, when, accompanied, by, modoki, variations, enso, costero, events, usually, present, more, localized, effects, with, warm, phases, leading, to, increased, rainfall, over, the, coast, of, ecuador, northern, peru, and, the, amazon, rainforest, and, increased, temperatures, over, the, northern, chilean, coast, and, cold, phases, leading, to, droughts, on, the, peruvian, coast, and, increased, rainfall, and, decreased, temperatures, on, its, mountainous, and, jungle, regions, because, they, don, t, influence, the, global, climate, as, much, as, the, other, types, these, events, present, lesser, and, weaker, correlations, to, other, significant, enso, features, neither, always, being, triggered, by, kelvin, waves, nor, always, being, accompanied, by, proportional, southern, oscillation, responses, according, to, the, coastal, ni, o, index, icen, strong, el, ni, o, costero, events, include, 1957, 1982, 83, 1997, 98, and, 2015, 16, and, la, ni, a, costera, ones, include, 1950, 1954, 56, 1962, 1964, 1966, 1967, 68, 1970, 71, 1975, 76, and, 2013, currently, each, country, has, a, different, threshold, for, what, constitutes, an, el, ni, o, event, which, is, tailored, to, their, specific, interests, for, example, in, climate, change, science, enso, is, known, as, one, of, the, internal, climate, variability, phenomena, the, other, two, main, ones, are, pacific, decadal, oscillation, and, atlantic, multidecadal, oscillation, 23, la, ni, a, impacts, the, global, climate, and, disrupts, normal, weather, patterns, which, can, lead, to, intense, storms, in, some, places, and, droughts, in, others, el, ni, o, events, cause, short, term, approximately, 1, year, in, length, spikes, in, global, average, surface, temperature, while, la, ni, a, events, cause, short, term, cooling, therefore, the, relative, frequency, of, el, ni, o, compared, to, la, ni, a, events, can, affect, global, temperature, trends, on, decadal, timescales, there, is, no, sign, that, there, are, actual, changes, in, the, enso, physical, phenomenon, due, to, climate, change, climate, models, do, not, simulate, enso, well, enough, to, make, reliable, predictions, future, trends, in, enso, are, uncertain, as, different, models, make, different, predictions, it, may, be, that, the, observed, phenomenon, of, more, frequent, and, stronger, el, ni, o, events, occurs, only, in, the, initial, phase, of, the, global, warming, and, then, e, g, after, the, lower, layers, of, the, ocean, get, warmer, as, well, el, ni, o, will, become, weaker, it, may, also, be, that, the, stabilizing, and, destabilizing, forces, influencing, the, phenomenon, will, eventually, compensate, for, each, other, the, consequences, of, enso, in, terms, of, the, temperature, anomalies, and, precipitation, and, weather, extremes, around, the, world, are, clearly, increasing, and, associated, with, climate, change, for, example, recent, scholarship, since, about, 2019, has, found, that, climate, change, is, increasing, the, frequency, of, extreme, el, ni, o, events, previously, there, was, no, consensus, on, whether, climate, change, will, have, any, influence, on, the, strength, or, duration, of, el, ni, o, events, as, research, alternately, supported, el, ni, o, events, becoming, stronger, and, weaker, longer, and, shorter, over, the, last, several, decades, the, number, of, el, ni, o, events, increased, and, the, number, of, la, ni, a, events, decreased, although, observation, of, enso, for, much, longer, is, needed, to, detect, robust, changes, studies, of, historical, data, show, the, recent, el, ni, o, variation, is, most, likely, linked, to, global, warming, for, example, some, results, even, after, subtracting, the, positive, influence, of, decadal, variation, are, shown, to, be, possibly, present, in, the, enso, trend, the, amplitude, of, the, enso, variability, in, the, observed, data, still, increases, by, as, much, as, 60, in, the, last, 50, years, a, study, published, in, 2023, by, csiro, researchers, found, that, climate, change, may, have, increased, by, two, times, the, likelihood, of, strong, el, ni, o, events, and, nine, times, the, likelihood, of, strong, la, ni, a, events, the, study, stated, it, found, a, consensus, between, different, models, and, experiments, the, ipcc, sixth, assessment, report, summarized, the, state, of, the, art, of, research, in, 2021, into, the, future, of, enso, as, follows, the, enso, is, considered, to, be, a, potential, tipping, element, in, earth, s, climate, global, warming, can, strengthen, the, enso, teleconnection, and, resulting, extreme, weather, events, for, example, an, increase, in, the, frequency, and, magnitude, of, el, ni, o, events, have, triggered, warmer, than, usual, temperatures, over, the, indian, ocean, by, modulating, the, walker, circulation, this, has, resulted, in, a, rapid, warming, of, the, indian, ocean, and, consequently, a, weakening, of, the, asian, monsoon, el, ni, o, affects, the, global, climate, and, disrupts, normal, weather, patterns, which, can, lead, to, intense, storms, in, some, places, and, droughts, in, others, most, tropical, cyclones, form, on, the, side, of, the, subtropical, ridge, closer, to, the, equator, then, move, poleward, past, the, ridge, axis, before, recurving, into, the, main, belt, of, the, westerlies, areas, west, of, japan, and, korea, tend, to, experience, many, fewer, september, november, tropical, cyclone, impacts, during, el, ni, o, and, neutral, years, during, el, ni, o, years, the, break, in, the, subtropical, ridge, tends, to, lie, near, 130, e, which, would, favor, the, japanese, archipelago, based, on, modeled, and, observed, accumulated, cyclone, energy, ace, el, ni, o, years, usually, result, in, less, active, hurricane, seasons, in, the, atlantic, ocean, but, instead, favor, a, shift, to, tropical, cyclone, activity, in, the, pacific, ocean, compared, to, la, ni, a, years, favoring, above, average, hurricane, development, in, the, atlantic, and, less, so, in, the, pacific, basin, over, the, atlantic, ocean, vertical, wind, shear, is, increased, which, inhibits, tropical, cyclone, genesis, and, intensification, by, causing, the, westerly, winds, to, be, stronger, the, atmosphere, over, the, atlantic, ocean, can, also, be, drier, and, more, stable, during, el, ni, o, events, which, can, inhibit, tropical, cyclone, genesis, and, intensification, within, the, eastern, pacific, basin, el, ni, o, events, contribute, to, decreased, easterly, vertical, wind, shear, and, favor, above, normal, hurricane, activity, however, the, impacts, of, the, enso, state, in, this, region, can, vary, and, are, strongly, influenced, by, background, climate, patterns, the, western, pacific, basin, experiences, a, change, in, the, location, of, where, tropical, cyclones, form, during, el, ni, o, events, with, tropical, cyclone, formation, shifting, eastward, without, a, major, change, in, how, many, develop, each, year, as, a, result, of, this, change, micronesia, is, more, likely, and, china, less, likely, to, be, affected, by, tropical, cyclones, a, change, in, the, location, of, where, tropical, cyclones, form, also, occurs, within, the, southern, pacific, ocean, between, 135, e, and, 120, w, with, tropical, cyclones, more, likely, to, occur, within, the, southern, pacific, basin, than, the, australian, region, as, a, result, of, this, change, tropical, cyclones, are, 50, less, likely, to, make, landfall, on, queensland, while, the, risk, of, a, tropical, cyclone, is, elevated, for, island, nations, like, niue, french, polynesia, tonga, tuvalu, and, the, cook, islands, a, study, of, climate, records, has, shown, that, el, ni, o, events, in, the, equatorial, pacific, are, generally, associated, with, a, warm, tropical, north, atlantic, in, the, following, spring, and, summer, about, half, of, el, ni, o, events, persist, sufficiently, into, the, spring, months, for, the, western, hemisphere, warm, pool, to, become, unusually, large, in, summer, occasionally, el, ni, o, s, effect, on, the, atlantic, walker, circulation, over, south, america, strengthens, the, easterly, trade, winds, in, the, western, equatorial, atlantic, region, as, a, result, an, unusual, cooling, may, occur, in, the, eastern, equatorial, atlantic, in, spring, and, summer, following, el, ni, o, peaks, in, winter, cases, of, el, ni, o, type, events, in, both, oceans, simultaneously, have, been, linked, to, severe, famines, related, to, the, extended, failure, of, monsoon, rains, when, el, ni, o, conditions, last, for, many, months, extensive, ocean, warming, and, the, reduction, in, easterly, trade, winds, limits, upwelling, of, cold, nutrient, rich, deep, water, and, its, economic, effect, on, local, fishing, for, an, international, market, can, be, serious, developing, countries, that, depend, on, their, own, agriculture, and, fishing, particularly, those, bordering, the, pacific, ocean, are, usually, most, affected, by, el, ni, o, conditions, in, this, phase, of, the, oscillation, the, pool, of, warm, water, in, the, pacific, near, south, america, is, often, at, its, warmest, in, late, december, more, generally, el, ni, o, can, affect, commodity, prices, and, the, macroeconomy, of, different, countries, it, can, constrain, the, supply, of, rain, driven, agricultural, commodities, reduce, agricultural, output, construction, and, services, activities, increase, food, prices, and, may, trigger, social, unrest, in, commodity, dependent, poor, countries, that, primarily, rely, on, imported, food, a, university, of, cambridge, working, paper, shows, that, while, australia, chile, indonesia, india, japan, new, zealand, and, south, africa, face, a, short, lived, fall, in, economic, activity, in, response, to, an, el, ni, o, shock, other, countries, may, actually, benefit, from, an, el, ni, o, weather, shock, either, directly, or, indirectly, through, positive, spillovers, from, major, trading, partners, for, instance, argentina, canada, mexico, and, the, united, states, furthermore, most, countries, experience, short, run, inflationary, pressures, following, an, el, ni, o, shock, while, global, energy, and, non, fuel, commodity, prices, increase, the, imf, estimates, a, significant, el, ni, o, can, boost, the, gdp, of, the, united, states, by, about, 0, 5, due, largely, to, lower, heating, bills, and, reduce, the, gdp, of, indonesia, by, about, 1, 0, extreme, weather, conditions, related, to, the, el, ni, o, cycle, correlate, with, changes, in, the, incidence, of, epidemic, diseases, for, example, the, el, ni, o, cycle, is, associated, with, increased, risks, of, some, of, the, diseases, transmitted, by, mosquitoes, such, as, malaria, dengue, fever, and, rift, valley, fever, cycles, of, malaria, in, india, venezuela, brazil, and, colombia, have, now, been, linked, to, el, ni, o, outbreaks, of, another, mosquito, transmitted, disease, australian, encephalitis, murray, valley, encephalitis, mve, occur, in, temperate, south, east, australia, after, heavy, rainfall, and, flooding, which, are, associated, with, la, ni, a, events, a, severe, outbreak, of, rift, valley, fever, occurred, after, extreme, rainfall, in, north, eastern, kenya, and, southern, somalia, during, the, 1997, 98, el, ni, o, enso, conditions, have, also, been, related, to, kawasaki, disease, incidence, in, japan, and, the, west, coast, of, the, united, states, via, the, linkage, to, tropospheric, winds, across, the, north, pacific, ocean, enso, may, be, linked, to, civil, conflicts, scientists, at, the, earth, institute, of, columbia, university, having, analyzed, data, from, 1950, to, 2004, suggest, enso, may, have, had, a, role, in, 21, of, all, civil, conflicts, since, 1950, with, the, risk, of, annual, civil, conflict, doubling, from, 3, to, 6, in, countries, affected, by, enso, during, el, ni, o, years, relative, to, la, ni, a, years, during, the, 1982, 83, 1997, 98, and, 2015, 16, enso, events, large, extensions, of, tropical, forests, experienced, a, prolonged, dry, period, that, resulted, in, widespread, fires, and, drastic, changes, in, forest, structure, and, tree, species, composition, in, amazonian, and, bornean, forests, their, impacts, do, not, restrict, only, vegetation, since, declines, in, insect, populations, were, observed, after, extreme, drought, and, terrible, fires, during, el, ni, o, 2015, 16, declines, in, habitat, specialist, and, disturbance, sensitive, bird, species, and, in, large, frugivorous, mammals, were, also, observed, in, amazonian, burned, forests, while, temporary, extirpation, of, more, than, 100, lowland, butterfly, species, occurred, at, a, burned, forest, site, in, borneo, in, seasonally, dry, tropical, forests, which, are, more, drought, tolerant, researchers, found, that, el, ni, o, induced, drought, increased, seedling, mortality, in, a, research, published, in, october, 2022, researchers, studied, seasonally, dry, tropical, forests, in, a, national, park, in, chiang, mai, in, thailand, for, 7, years, and, observed, that, el, ni, o, increased, seedling, mortality, even, in, seasonally, dry, tropical, forests, and, may, impact, entire, forests, in, long, run, following, the, el, nino, event, in, 1997, 1998, the, pacific, marine, environmental, laboratory, attributes, the, first, large, scale, coral, bleaching, event, to, the, warming, waters, most, critically, global, mass, bleaching, events, were, recorded, in, 1997, 98, and, 2015, 16, when, around, 75, 99, losses, of, live, coral, were, registered, across, the, world, considerable, attention, was, also, given, to, the, collapse, of, peruvian, and, chilean, anchovy, populations, that, led, to, a, severe, fishery, crisis, following, the, enso, events, in, 1972, 73, 1982, 83, 1997, 98, and, more, recently, in, 2015, 16, in, particular, increased, surface, seawater, temperatures, in, 1982, 83, also, lead, to, the, probable, extinction, of, two, hydrocoral, species, in, panam, and, to, a, massive, mortality, of, kelp, beds, along, 600, km, of, coastline, in, chile, from, which, kelps, and, associated, biodiversity, slowly, recovered, in, the, most, affected, areas, even, after, 20, years, all, these, findings, enlarge, the, role, of, enso, events, as, a, strong, climatic, force, driving, ecological, changes, all, around, the, world, particularly, in, tropical, forests, and, coral, reefs, observations, of, enso, events, since, 1950, show, that, impacts, associated, with, such, events, depend, on, the, time, of, year, while, certain, events, and, impacts, are, expected, to, occur, it, is, not, certain, that, they, will, happen, the, impacts, that, generally, do, occur, during, most, el, ni, o, events, include, below, average, rainfall, over, indonesia, and, northern, south, america, and, above, average, rainfall, in, southeastern, south, america, eastern, equatorial, africa, and, the, southern, united, states, la,

and, summer, rainfall, areas, tend, to, get, less, rain, the, effect, on, the, summer, rainfall, areas, is, stronger, and, has, led, to, severe, drought, in, strong, el, ni, o, events, sea, surface, temperatures, off, the, west, and, south, coasts, of, south, africa, are, affected, by, enso, via, changes, in, surface, wind, strength, during, el, ni, o, the, south, easterly, winds, driving, upwelling, are, weaker, which, results, in, warmer, coastal, waters, than, normal, while, during, la, ni, a, the, same, winds, are, stronger, and, cause, colder, coastal, waters, these, effects, on, the, winds, are, part, of, large, scale, influences, on, the, tropical, atlantic, and, the, south, atlantic, high, pressure, system, and, changes, to, the, pattern, of, westerly, winds, further, south, there, are, other, influences, not, known, to, be, related, to, enso, of, similar, importance, some, enso, events, do, not, lead, to, the, expected, changes, many, enso, linkages, exist, in, the, high, southern, latitudes, around, antarctica, specifically, el, ni, o, conditions, result, in, high, pressure, anomalies, over, the, amundsen, and, bellingshausen, seas, causing, reduced, sea,

australia, is, delayed, by, two, to, six, weeks, which, as, a, consequence, means, that, rainfall, is, reduced, over, the, northern, tropics, the, risk, of, a, significant, bushfire, season, in, south, eastern, australia, is, higher, following, an, el, ni, o, event, especially, when, it, is, combined, with, a, positive, indian, ocean, dipole, event, effects, of, the, el, ni, o, southern,

but, some, can, persist, for, two, years, though, the, enso, cycle, generally, operates, over, a, time, period, from, one, to, eight, years, el, ni, o, s, effects, on, europe, are, controversial, complex, and, difficult, to, analyze, as, it, is, one, of, several, factors, that, influence, the, weather, over, the, continent, and, other, factors, can, overwhelm, the, signal, la, ni, a, causes, mostly, the, opposite, effects, of, el, ni, o, above, average, precipitation, across, the, northern, midwest, the, northern, rockies, northern, california, and, the, pacific, northwest, s, southern, and, eastern, regions, meanwhile, precipitation, in, the, southwestern, and, southeastern, states, as, well, as, southern, california, is, below, average, this, also, allows, for, the, development,

above, normal, across, the, pacific, northwest, and, western, great, lakes, in, canada, la, ni, a, will, in, general, cause, a, cooler, snowier, winter, such, as, the, near, record, breaking, amounts, of, snow, recorded, in, the, la, ni, a, winter, of, 2007, 2008, in, eastern, canada, in, the, spring, of, 2022, la, ni, a, caused, above, average, precipitation, and, below, average, temperatures, in, the, state, of, oregon, april, was, one, of, the, wettest, months, on, record, and, la, ni, a, effects, while, less, severe, were, expected, to, continue, into, the, summer, over, north, america, the, main, temperature, and, precipitation, impacts, of, el, ni, o, generally, occur, in, the, six, months, between, october, and, march, in, particular, the, majority, of, canada, generally, has, milder, than, normal, winters, and, springs, with, the, exception, of, eastern, canada, where, no, significant, impacts, occur, within, the, united, states, the, impacts, generally, observed, during, the,

northwest, and, the, rocky, mountains, study, of, more, recent, weather, events, over, california, and, the, southwestern, united, states, indicate, that, there, is, a, variable, relationship, between, el, ni, o, and, above, average, precipitation, as, it, strongly, depends, on, the, strength, of, the, el, ni, o, event, and, other, factors, though, it, has, been, historically, associated, with, high, rainfall, in, california, the, effects, of, el, ni, o, depend, more, strongly, on, the, flavor, of, el, ni, o, than, its, presence, or, absence, as, only, persistent, el, ni, o, events, lead, to, consistently, high, rainfall, to, the, north, across, alaska, la, ni, a, events, lead, to, drier, than, normal, conditions, while, el, ni, o, events, do, not, have, a, correlation, towards, dry, or, wet, conditions, during, el, ni, o, events, increased, precipitation, is, expected, in, california, due, to, a, more, southerly, zonal, storm, track, during, la, ni, a, increased, precipitation, is, diverted, into, the, pacific, northwest, due, to, a, more, northerly, storm, track, during, la, ni, a, events, the, storm, track, shifts, far, enough, northward, to, bring, wetter, than, normal, winter, conditions, in, the, form, of, increased, snowfall, to, the, midwestern, states, as, well, as, hot, and, dry, summers, during, the, el, ni, o, portion, of, enso, increased,
