became, known, as, tyrian, purple, the, process, of, making, the, dye, was, long, difficult, and, expensive, thousands, of, the, tiny, snails, had, to, be, found, their, shells, cracked, the, snail, removed, mountains, of, empty, shells, have, been, found, at, the, ancient, sites, of, sidon, and, tyre, the, snails, were, left, to, soak, then, a, tiny, gland, was, removed, and, the, juice, extracted, and, put, in, a, basin, which, was, placed, in, the, sunlight, there, a, remarkable, transformation, took, place, in, the, sunlight, the, juice, turned, white, then, yellow, green, then, green, then, violet, then, a, red, which, turned, darker, and, darker, the, process, had, to, be, stopped, at, exactly, the, right, time, to, obtain, the, desired, color, which, could, range, from, a, bright, crimson, to, a, dark, purple, the, color, of, dried, blood, then, either, wool, linen, or, silk, would, be, dyed, the, exact, hue, varied, between, crimson, and, violet, but, it, was, always,

empire, the, basileus, of, the, seleucid, empire, and, the, kings, of, ptolemaic, egypt, all, wore, tyrian, purple, the, roman, custom, of, wearing, purple, togas, may, have, come, from, the, etruscans, an, etruscan, tomb, painting, from, the, 4th, century, bc, shows, a, nobleman, wearing, a, deep, purple, and, embroidered, toga, in, ancient, rome, the, toga, praetexta, was, an, ordinary, white, toga, with, a, broad, purple, stripe, on, its, border, it, was, worn, by, freeborn, roman, boys, who, had, not, yet, come, of, age, curule, magistrates, certain, categories, of, priests, and,

with, the, emperors, and, their, officers, suetonius, claims, that, the, early, emperor, caligula, had, the, king, of, mauretania, murdered, for, the, splendour, of, his, purple, cloak, and, that, nero, forbade, the, use, of, certain, purple, dyes, in, the, late, empire, the, sale, of, purple, cloth, became, a, state, monopoly, protected, by, the, death, penalty, according, to, the, new,

actual, color, of, tyrian, purple, seems, to, have, varied, from, a, reddish, to, a, bluish, purple, according, to, the, roman, writer, vitruvius, 1st, century, bc, the, murex, shells, coming, from, northern, waters, probably, bolinus, brandaris, produced, a, more, bluish, color, than, those, of, the, south, probably, hexaplex, trunculus, the, most, valued, shades, were, said, to, be, those, closer, to, the, color, of, dried, blood, as, seen, in, the, mosaics, of, the, robes, of, the, emperor, justinian, in, ravenna, the, chemical, composition, of, the, dye, from, the, murex, is, close, to, that, of, the, dye, from, indigo, and, indigo, was, sometimes, used, to, make, a, counterfeit, tyrian, purple, a, crime, which, was, severely, punished, what, seems, to, have, mattered, about, tyrian, purple, was, not, its, color, but, its, luster, richness, its, resistance, to, weather, and, light, and, its, high, price, in, modern, times, tyrian, purple, has, been, recreated, at, great, expense, when, the, german, chemist, paul, friedander, tried, to, recreate, tyrian, purple, in, 2008, he, needed, twelve, thousand, mollusks, to, create, 1, 4, ounces, of, dye, enough, to, color, a, handkerchief, in, the, year, 2000, a, gram, of, tyrian, purple, made, from, ten, thousand, mollusks, according, to, the, original, formula, cost, two, thousand, euros, in, ancient, china, purple, was, obtained, not, through, the, mediterranean, mollusc, but, purple, gromwell, the, dye, obtained, did, not, easily, adhere, to, fabrics, making, purple, fabrics, expensive, purple, became, a, fashionable, color, in, the, state, of, qi, 1046, bc, 221, bc, because, its, ruler, duke, huan, of, qi, developed, a, preference, for, it, as, a, result, the, price, of, purple, fabric, was, over, five, times, that, of, plain, fabric, his, minister, guan, zhong, eventually, convinced, him, to, relinquish, this, preference, china, was, the, first, culture, to, develop, a, synthetic, purple, color, an, old, hypothesis, suggested, links, between, the, chinese, purple, and, blue, and, egyptian, blue, however, molecular, structure, analysis, and, evidence, such, as, the, absence, of, lead, in, egyptian, blue, and, the, lack, of, examples, of, egyptian, blue, in, china, argued, against, the, hypothesis, the, use, of, quartz, barium, and, lead, components, in, ancient, chinese, glass, and, han, purple, and, han, blue, has, been, used, to, suggest, a, connection, between, glassmaking, and, the, manufacture, of, pigments, and, to, prove, the, independence, of, the, chinese, invention, taoist, alchemists, may, have, developed, han, purple, from, their, knowledge, of, glassmaking, lead, is, used, by, the, pigment, maker, to, lower, the, melting, point, of, the, barium, in, han, purple, purple, was, regarded, as, a, secondary, color, in, ancient, china, in, classical, times, secondary, colors, were, not, as, highly, prized, as, the, five, primary, colors, of, the, chinese, spectrum, and, purple, was, used, to, allude, to, impropriety, in, contrast, to, crimson, which, was, deemed, a, primary, color, and, symbolized, legitimacy, nevertheless, by, the, 6th, century, ad, purple, was, ranked, above, crimson, several, changes, to, the, ranks, of, colors, occurred, after, that, time, through, the, early, christian, era, the, rulers, of, the, byzantine, empire, continued, the, use, of, purple, as, the, imperial, color, for, diplomatic, gifts, and, even, for, imperial, documents, and, the, pages, of, the, bible, gospel, manuscripts, were, written, in, gold, lettering, on, parchment, that, was, colored, tyrian, purple, empresses, gave, birth, in, the, purple, chamber, and, the, emperors, born, there, were, known, as, born, to, the, purple, to, separate, them, from, emperors, who, won, or, seized, the, title, through, political, intrigue, or, military, force, bishops, of, the, byzantine, church, wore, white, robes, with, stripes, of, purple, while, government, officials, wore, squares, of, purple, fabric, to, show, their, rank, in, western, europe, the, emperor, charlemagne, was, crowned, in, 800, wearing, a, mantle, of, tyrian, purple, and, was, buried, in, 814, in, a, shroud, of, the, same, color, which, still, exists, see, below, however, after, the, fall, of, constantinople, to, the, ottoman, turks, in, 1453, the, color, lost, its, imperial, status, the, great, dye, works, of, constantinople, were, destroyed, and, gradually, scarlet, made, with, dye, from, the, cochineal, insect, became, the, royal, color, in, europe, in, 1464, pope, paul, ii, decreed, that, cardinals, should, no, longer, wear, tyrian, purple, and, instead, wear, scarlet, from, kermes, and, alum, since, the, dye, from, byzantium, was, no, longer, available, bishops, and, archbishops, of, a, lower, status, than, cardinals, were, assigned, the, color, purple, but, not, the, rich, tyrian, purple, they, wore, cloth, dyed, first, with, the, less, expensive, indigo, blue, then, overlaid, with, red, made, from, kermes, dye, while, purple, was, worn, less, frequently, by, medieval, and, renaissance, kings, and, princes, it, was, worn, by, the, professors, of, many, of, europe, s, new, universities, their, robes, were, modeled, after, those, of, the, clergy, and, they, often, wore, square, violet, or, purple, violet, caps, and, robes, or, black, robes, with, purple, violet, trim, purple, violet, robes, were, particularly, worn, by, students, of, divinity, purple, and, violet, also, played, an, important, part, in, the, religious, paintings, of, the, renaissance, angels, and, the, virgin, mary, were, often, portrayed, wearing, purple, or, violet, robes, in, the, 18th, century, purple, was, still, worn, on, occasion, by, catherine, the, great, and, other, rulers, by, bishops, and, in, lighter, shades, by, members, of, the, aristocracy, but, rarely, by, ordinary, people, because, of, its, high, cost, but, in, the, 19th, century, that, changed, in, 1856, an, eighteen, year, old, british, chemistry, student, named, william, henry, perkin, was, trying, to, make, a, synthetic, quinine, his, experiments, produced, instead, the, first, synthetic, aniline, dye, a, purple, shade, called, mauveine, shortened, simply, to, mauve, it, took, its, name, from, the, mallow, flower, which, is, the, same, color, the, new, color, quickly, became, fashionable, particularly, after, queen, victoria, wore, a, silk, gown, dyed, with, mauveine, to, the, royal, exhibition, of, 1862, prior, to, perkin, s, discovery, mauve, was, a, color, which, only, the, aristocracy, and, rich, could, afford, to, wear, perkin, developed, an, industrial, process, built, a, factory, and, produced, the, dye, by, the, ton, so, almost, anyone, could, wear, mauve, it, was, the, first, of, a, series, of, modern, industrial, dyes, which, completely, transformed, both, the, chemical, industry, and, fashion, purple, was, popular, with, the, pre, raphaelite, painters, in, britain, including, arthur, hughes, who, loved, bright, colors, and, romantic, scenes, at, the, turn, of, the, century, purple, was, a, favorite, color, of, the, austrian, painter, gustav, klimt, who, flooded, his, pictures, with, sensual, purples, and, violets, in, the, 20th, century, purple, retained, its, historic, connection, with, royalty, george, vi, 1896, 1952, wore, purple, in, his, official, portrait, and, it, was, prominent, in, every, feature, of, the, coronation, of, elizabeth, ii, in, 1953, from, the, invitations, to, the, stage, design, inside, westminster, abbey, but, at, the, same, time, it, was, becoming, associated, with, social, change, with, the, women, s, suffrage, movement, for, the, right, to, vote, for, women, in, the, early, decades, of, the, century, with, feminism, in, the, 1970s, and, with, the, psychedelic, drug, culture, of, the, 1960s, in, the, early, 20th, century, purple, green, and, white, were, the, colors, of, the, women, s, suffrage, movement, which, fought, to, win, the, right, to, vote, for, women, finally, succeeding, with, the, 19th, amendment, to, the, u, s, constitution, in, 1920, later, in, the, 1970s, in, a, tribute, to, the, suffragettes, it, became, the, color, of, the, women, s, liberation, movement, in, the, concentration, camps, of, nazi, germany, prisoners, who, were, members, of, non, conformist, religious, groups, such, as, the, jehovah, s, witnesses, were, required, to, wear, a, purple, triangle, during, the, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, it, was, also, associated, with, counterculture, psychedelics, and, musicians, like, jimi, hendrix, with, his, 1967, song, purple, haze, or, the, english, rock, band, of, deep, purple, which, formed, in, 1968, later, in, the, 1980s, it, was, featured, in, the, song, and, album, purple, rain, 1984, by, the, american, musician, prince, the, purple, rain, protest, was, a, protest, against, apartheid, that, took, place, in, cape, town, south, africa, on, 2, september, 1989, in, which, a, police, water, cannon, with, purple, dye, sprayed, thousands, of, demonstrators, this, led, to, the, slogan, the, purple, shall, govern, the, violet, or, purple, necktie, became, very, popular, at, the, end, of, the, first, decade, of, the, 21st, century, particularly, among, political, and, business, leaders, it, combined, the, assertiveness, and, confidence, of, a, red, necktie, with, the, sense, of, peace, and, cooperation, of, a, blue, necktie, and, it, went, well, with, the, blue, business, suit, worn, by, most, national, and, corporate, leaders, the, meanings, of, the, color, terms, violet, and, purple, varies, even, among, native, speakers, of, english, for, example, between, united, kingdom, and, united, states, optics, research, on, purple, and, violet, contains, contributions, of, authors, from, different, countries, and, different, native, languages, it, is, likely, to, be, inconsistent, in, the, use, and, meaning, of, the, two, colors, according, to, some, speakers, authors, of, english, purple, unlike, violet, is, not, one, of, the, colors, of, the, visible, spectrum, it, was, not, one, of, the, colors, of, the, rainbow, identified, by, isaac, newton, according, to, some, authors, purple, does, not, have, its, own, wavelength, of, light, for, this, reason, it, is, sometimes, called, a, non, spectral, color, it, exists, in, culture, and, art, but, not, in, the, same, way, that, violet, does, in, optics, according, to, some, speakers, of, english, purple, is, simply, a, combination, in, various, proportions, of, two, primary, colors, red, and, blue, according, to, other, speakers, of, english, the, same, range, of, colors, is, called, violet, in, some, textbooks, of, color, theory, and, depending, on, the, geographical, cultural, origin, of, the, author, a, purple, is, defined, as, any, non, spectral, color, between, violet, and, red, excluding, violet, and, red, themselves, in, that, case, the, spectral, colors, violet, and, indigo, would, not, be, shades, of, purple, for, other, speakers, of, english, these, colors, are, shades, of, purple, in, the, traditional, color, wheel, long, used, by, painters, purple, is, placed, between, crimson, and, violet, however, also, here, there, is, much, variation, in, color, terminology, depending, on, cultural, background, of, the, painters, and, authors, and, sometimes, the, term, violet, is, used, and, placed, in, between, red, and, blue, on, the, traditional, color, wheel, in, a, slightly, different, variation, on, the, color, wheel, purple, is, placed, between, magenta, and, violet, this, shade, is, sometimes, called, electric, purple, see, shades, of, purple, in, the, rgb, color, model, named, for, the, colors, red, green, and, blue, used, to, create, all, the, colors, on, a, computer, screen, or, television, the, range, of, purples, is, created, by, mixing, red, and, blue, light, of, different, intensities, on, a, black, screen, the, standard, html, color, purple, is, created, by, red, and, blue, light, of, equal, intensity, at, a, brightness, that, is, halfway, between, full, power, and, darkness, in, color, printing, purple, is, sometimes, represented, by, the, color, magenta, or, sometimes, by, mixing, magenta, with, red, or, blue, it, can, also, be, created, by, mixing, just, red, and, blue, alone, but, in, that, case, the, purple, is, less, bright, with, lower, saturation, or, intensity, a, less, bright, purple, can, also, be, created, with, light, or, paint, by, adding, a, certain, quantity, of, the, third, primary, color, green, for, light, or, yellow, for, pigment, purple, is, closely, associated, with, violet, in, common, usage, both, refer, to, a, variety, of, colors, between, blue, and, red, in, hue, historically, purple, has, tended, to, be, used, for, redder, hues, and, violet, for, bluer, hues, in, optics, violet, is, a, spectral, color, it, refers, to, the, color, of, any, different, single, wavelength, of, light, on, the, short, wavelength, end, of, the, visible, spectrum, between, approximately, 380, and, 450, nanometers, whereas, purple, is, the, color, of, various, combinations, of, red, blue, and, violet, light, some, of, which, humans, perceive, as, similar, to, violet, on, a, chromaticity, diagram, the, straight, line, connecting, the, extreme, spectral, colors, red, and, violet, is, known, as, the, line, of, purples, or, purple, boundary, it, represents, one, limit, of, human, color, perception, the, color, magenta, used, in, the, cmyk, printing, process, is, near, the, center, of, the, line, of, purples, but, most, people, associate, the, term, purple, with, a, somewhat, bluer, tone, such, as, is, displayed, by, the, color, electric, purple, a, color, also, directly, on, the, line, of, purples, shown, below, on, the, cie, xy, chromaticity, diagram, violet, is, on, the, curved, edge, in, the, lower, left, while, purples, are, on, the, straight, line, connecting, the, extreme, colors, red, and, violet, this, line, is, known, as, the, line, of, purples, or, the, purple, line, during, the, middle, ages, artists, usually, made, purple, by, combining, red, and, blue, pigments, most, often, blue, azurite, or, lapis, lazuli, with, red, ochre, cinnabar, or, minium, they, also, combined, lake, colors, made, by, mixing, dye, with, powder, using, woad, or, indigo, dye, for, the, blue, and, dye, made, from, cochineal, for, the, red, the, most, famous, purple, dye, in, the, ancient, world, was, tyrian, purple, made, from, a, type, of, sea, snail, called, the, murex, found, around, the, mediterranean, see, history, section, above, in, western, polynesia, residents, of, the, islands, made, a, purple, dye, similar, to, tyrian, purple, from, the, sea, urchin, in, central, america, the, inhabitants, made, a, dye, from, a, different, sea, snail, the, purpura, found, on, the, coasts, of, costa, rica, and, nicaragua, the, mayans, used, this, color, to, dye, fabric, for, religious, ceremonies, while, the, aztecs, used, it, for, paintings, of, ideograms, where, it, symbolized, royalty, in, the, middle, ages, those, who, worked, with, blue, and, black, dyes, belonged, to, separate, guilds, from, those, who, worked, with, red, and, yellow, dyes, and, were, often, forbidden, to, dye, any, other, colors, than, those, of, their, own, guild, most, purple, fabric, was, made, by, the, dyers, who, worked, with, red, and, who, used, dye, from, madder, or, cochineal, so, medieval, violet, colors, were, inclined, toward, red, orcein, or, purple, moss, was, another, common, purple, dye, it, was, known, to, the, ancient, greeks, and, hebrews, and, was, made, from, a, mediterranean, lichen, called, archil, or, dyer, s, moss, roccella, tinctoria, combined, with, an, ammoniac, usually, urine, orcein, began, to, achieve, popularity, again, in, the, 19th, century, when, violet, and, purple, became, the, color, of, demi, mourning, worn, after, a, widow, or, widower, had, worn, black, for, a, certain, time, before, he, or, she, returned, to, wearing, ordinary, colors, from, the, middle, ages, onward, purple, dyes, for, the, clothing, of, common, people, were, often, made, from, the, blackberry, or, other, red, fruit, of, the, genus, rubus, or, from, the, mulberry, all, of, these, dyes, were, more, reddish, than, bluish, and, faded, easily, with, washing, and, exposure, to, sunlight, a, popular, new, dye, which, arrived, in, europe, from, the, new, world, during, the, renaissance, was, made, from, the, wood, of, the, logwood, tree, h, aematoxylum, campechianum, which, grew, in, spanish, mexico, depending, on, the, different, minerals, added, to, the, dye, it, produced, a, blue, red, black, or, with, the, addition, of, alum, a, purple, color, it, made, a, good, color, but, like, earlier, dyes, it, did, not, resist, sunlight, or, washing, in, the, 18th, century, chemists, in, england, france, and, germany, began, to, create, the, first, synthetic, dyes, two, synthetic, purple, dyes, were, invented, at, about, the, same, time, cudbear, is, a, dye, extracted, from, orchil, lichens, that, can, be, used, to, dye, wool, and, silk, without, the, use, of, mordant, cudbear, was, developed, by, dr, cuthbert, gordon, of, scotland, production, began, in, 1758, the, lichen, is, first, boiled, in, a, solution, of, ammonium, carbonate, the, mixture, is, then, cooled, and, ammonia, is, added, and, the, mixture, is, kept, damp, for, 3, 4, weeks, then, the, lichen, is, dried, and, ground, to, powder, the, manufacture, details, were, carefully, protected, with, a, ten, feet, high, wall, being, built, around, the, manufacturing, facility, and, staff, consisting, of, highlanders, sworn, to, secrecy, french, purple, was, developed, in, france, at, about, the, same, time, the, lichen, is, extracted, by,

synthetic, dye, made, shortly, after, mauveine, it, produced, a, brilliant, fuchsia, color, in, the, 1950s, a, new, family, of, purple, and, violet, synthetic, organic, pigments, called, quinacridone, came, onto, the, market, it, had, originally, been, discovered, in, 1896, but, were, not, synthesized, until, 1936, and, not, manufactured, until, the, 1950s, the, colors, in, the, group, range, from, deep, red, to, bluish, purple, in, color, and, have, the, molecular, formula, c, 20, h, 12, n, 2, o, 2, they, have, strong, resistance, to, sunlight, and, washing, and, are, widely, used, today, in,

the, bluish, color, is, caused, by, an, optical, effect, called, rayleigh, scattering, the, sunlit, sky, is, blue, because, air, scatters, short, wavelength, light, more, than, longer, wavelengths, since, blue, light, is, at, the, short, wavelength, end, of, the, visible, spectrum, it, is, more, strongly, scattered, in, the, atmosphere, than, long, wavelength, red, light, the, result, is, that, the, human, eye, perceives, blue, when, looking, toward, parts, of, the, sky, other, than, the, sun, at, sunrise, and, sunset, the, light, is, passing, through, the, atmosphere, at, a, lower, angle, and, traveling, a, greater, distance, through, a, larger, volume, of, air, much, of, the, green, and, blue, is, scattered, away, and, more, red, light, comes, to, the, eye, creating, the, colors, of, the, sunrise, and, sunset, and, making, the, mountains, look, purple, the, phenomenon, is, referenced, in, the, song, america, the, beautiful, where, the, lyrics, refer, to, purple, mountains,
