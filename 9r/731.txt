climate, is, the, long, term, weather, pattern, in, a, region, typically, averaged, over, 30, years, more, rigorously, it, is, the, mean, and, variability, of, meteorological, variables, over, a, time, spanning, from, months, to, millions, of, years, some, of, the, meteorological, variables, that, are, commonly, measured, are, temperature, humidity, atmospheric, pressure, wind, and, precipitation, in, a, broader, sense, climate, is, the, state, of, the, components, of, the, climate, system, including, the, atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, lithosphere, and, biosphere, and, the, interactions, between, them, the, climate, of, a, location, is, affected, by, its, latitude, longitude, terrain, altitude, land, use, and, nearby, water, bodies, and, their, currents, climates, can, be, classified, according, to, the, average, and, typical, variables, most, commonly, temperature, and, precipitation, the, most, widely, used, classification, scheme, is, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, the, thornthwaite, system, in, use, since, 1948, incorporates, evapotranspiration, along, with, temperature, and, precipitation, information, and, is, used, in, studying, biological, diversity, and, how, climate, change, affects, it, the, major, classifications, in, thornthwaite, s, climate, classification, are, microthermal, mesothermal, and, megathermal, finally, the, bergeron, and, spatial, synoptic, classification, systems, focus, on, the, origin, of, air, masses, that, define, the, climate, of, a, region, paleoclimatology, is, the, study, of, ancient, climates, paleoclimatologists, seek, to, explain, climate, variations, for, all, parts, of, the, earth, during, any, given, geologic, period, beginning, with, the, time, of, the, earth, s, formation, since, very, few, direct, observations, of, climate, were, available, before, the, 19th, century, paleoclimates, are, inferred, from, proxy, variables, they, include, non, biotic, evidence, such, as, sediments, found, in, lake, beds, and, ice, cores, and, biotic, evidence, such, as, tree, rings, and, coral, climate, models, are, mathematical, models, of, past, present, and, future, climates, climate, change, may, occur, over, long, and, short, timescales, due, to, various, factors, recent, warming, is, discussed, in, terms, of, global, warming, which, results, in, redistributions, of, biota, for, example, as, climate, scientist, lesley, ann, hughes, has, written, a, 3, c, change, in, mean, annual, temperature, corresponds, to, a, shift, in, isotherms, of, approximately, 300, 400, km, in, latitude, in, the, temperate, zone, or, 500, m, in, elevation, therefore, species, are, expected, to, move, upwards, in, elevation, or, towards, the, poles, in, latitude, in, response, to, shifting, climate, zones, climate, from, ancient, greek, inclination, is, commonly, defined, as, the, weather, averaged, over, a, long, period, the, standard, averaging, period, is, 30, years, but, other, periods, may, be, used, depending, on, the, purpose, climate, also, includes, statistics, other, than, the, average, such, as, the, magnitudes, of, day, to, day, or, year, to, year, variations, the, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, ipcc, 2001, glossary, definition, is, as, follows, climate, in, a, narrow, sense, is, usually, defined, as, the, average, weather, or, more, rigorously, as, the, statistical, description, in, terms, of, the, mean, and, variability, of, relevant, quantities, over, a, period, ranging, from, months, to, thousands, or, millions, of, years, the, classical, period, is, 30, years, as, defined, by, the, world, meteorological, organization, wmo, these, quantities, are, most, often, surface, variables, such, as, temperature, precipitation, and, wind, climate, in, a, wider, sense, is, the, state, including, a, statistical, description, of, the, climate, system, the, world, meteorological, organization, wmo, describes, climate, normals, as, reference, points, used, by, climatologists, to, compare, current, climatological, trends, to, that, of, the, past, or, what, is, considered, typical, a, climate, normal, is, defined, as, the, arithmetic, average, of, a, climate, element, e, g, temperature, over, a, 30, year, period, a, 30, year, period, is, used, as, it, is, long, enough, to, filter, out, any, interannual, variation, or, anomalies, such, as, el, ni, o, southern, oscillation, but, also, short, enough, to, be, able, to, show, longer, climatic, trends, the, wmo, originated, from, the, international, meteorological, organization, which, set, up, a, technical, commission, for, climatology, in, 1929, at, its, 1934, wiesbaden, meeting, the, technical, commission, designated, the, thirty, year, period, from, 1901, to, 1930, as, the, reference, time, frame, for, climatological, standard, normals, in, 1982, the, wmo, agreed, to, update, climate, normals, and, these, were, subsequently, completed, on, the, basis, of, climate, data, from, 1, january, 1961, to, 31, december, 1990, the, 1961, 1990, climate, normals, serve, as, the, baseline, reference, period, the, next, set, of, climate, normals, to, be, published, by, wmo, is, from, 1991, to, 2010, aside, from, collecting, from, the, most, common, atmospheric, variables, air, temperature, pressure, precipitation, and, wind, other, variables, such, as, humidity, visibility, cloud, amount, solar, radiation, soil, temperature, pan, evaporation, rate, days, with, thunder, and, days, with, hail, are, also, collected, to, measure, change, in, climate, conditions, the, difference, between, climate, and, weather, is, usefully, summarized, by, the, popular, phrase, climate, is, what, you, expect, weather, is, what, you, get, over, historical, time, spans, there, are, a, number, of, nearly, constant, variables, that, determine, climate, including, latitude, altitude, proportion, of, land, to, water, and, proximity, to, oceans, and, mountains, all, of, these, variables, change, only, over, periods, of, millions, of, years, due, to, processes, such, as, plate, tectonics, other, climate, determinants, are, more, dynamic, the, thermohaline, circulation, of, the, ocean, leads, to, a, 5, c, 41, f, warming, of, the, northern, atlantic, ocean, compared, to, other, ocean, basins, other, ocean, currents, redistribute, heat, between, land, and, water, on, a, more, regional, scale, the, density, and, type, of, vegetation, coverage, affects, solar, heat, absorption, water, retention, and, rainfall, on, a, regional, level, alterations, in, the, quantity, of, atmospheric, greenhouse, gases, particularly, carbon, dioxide, and, methane, determines, the, amount, of, solar, energy, retained, by, the, planet, leading, to, global, warming, or, global, cooling, the, variables, which, determine, climate, are, numerous, and, the, interactions, complex, but, there, is, general, agreement, that, the, broad, outlines, are, understood, at, least, insofar, as, the, determinants, of, historical, climate, change, are, concerned, climate, classifications, are, systems, that, categorize, the, world, s, climates, a, climate, classification, may, correlate, closely, with, a, biome, classification, as, climate, is, a, major, influence, on, life, in, a, region, one, of, the, most, used, is, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, scheme, first, developed, in, 1899, there, are, several, ways, to, classify, climates, into, similar, regimes, originally, climes, were, defined, in, ancient, greece, to, describe, the, weather, depending, upon, a, location, s, latitude, modern, climate, classification, methods, can, be, broadly, divided, into, genetic, methods, which, focus, on, the, causes, of, climate, and, empiric, methods, which, focus, on, the, effects, of, climate, examples, of, genetic, classification, include, methods, based, on, the, relative, frequency, of, different, air, mass, types, or, locations, within, synoptic, weather, disturbances, examples, of, empiric, classifications, include, climate, zones, defined, by, plant, hardiness, evapotranspiration, or, more, generally, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, which, was, originally, designed, to, identify, the, climates, associated, with, certain, biomes, a, common, shortcoming, of, these, classification, schemes, is, that, they, produce, distinct, boundaries, between, the, zones, they, define, rather, than, the, gradual, transition, of, climate, properties, more, common, in, nature, paleoclimatology, is, the, study, of, past, climate, over, a, great, period, of, the, earth, s, history, it, uses, evidence, with, different, time, scales, from, decades, to, millennia, from, ice, sheets, tree, rings, sediments, pollen, coral, and, rocks, to, determine, the, past, state, of, the, climate, it, demonstrates, periods, of, stability, and, periods, of, change, and, can, indicate, whether, changes, follow, patterns, such, as, regular, cycles, details, of, the, modern, climate, record, are, known, through, the, taking, of, measurements, from, such, weather, instruments, as, thermometers, barometers, and, anemometers, during, the, past, few, centuries, the, instruments, used, to, study, weather, over, the, modern, time, scale, their, observation, frequency, their, known, error, their, immediate, environment, and, their, exposure, have, changed, over, the, years, which, must, be, considered, when, studying, the, climate, of, centuries, past, long, term, modern, climate, records, skew, towards, population, centres, and, affluent, countries, since, the, 1960s, the, launch, of, satellites, allow, records, to, be, gathered, on, a, global, scale, including, areas, with, little, to, no, human, presence, such, as, the, arctic, region, and, oceans, climate, variability, is, the, term, to, describe, variations, in, the, mean, state, and, other, characteristics, of, climate, such, as, chances, or, possibility, of, extreme, weather, etc, on, all, spatial, and, temporal, scales, beyond, that, of, individual, weather, events, some, of, the, variability, does, not, appear, to, be, caused, systematically, and, occurs, at, random, times, such, variability, is, called, random, variability, or, noise, on, the, other, hand, periodic, variability, occurs, relatively, regularly, and, in, distinct, modes, of, variability, or, climate, patterns, there, are, close, correlations, between, earth, s, climate, oscillations, and, astronomical, factors, barycenter, changes, solar, variation, cosmic, ray, flux, cloud, albedo, feedback, milankovic, cycles, and, modes, of, heat, distribution, between, the, ocean, atmosphere, climate, system, in, some, cases, current, historical, and, paleoclimatological, natural, oscillations, may, be, masked, by, significant, volcanic, eruptions, impact, events, irregularities, in, climate, proxy, data, positive, feedback, processes, or, anthropogenic, emissions, of, substances, such, as, greenhouse, gases, over, the, years, the, definitions, of, climate, variability, and, the, related, term, climate, change, have, shifted, while, the, term, climate, change, now, implies, change, that, is, both, long, term, and, of, human, causation, in, the, 1960s, the, word, climate, change, was, used, for, what, we, now, describe, as, climate, variability, that, is, climatic, inconsistencies, and, anomalies, climate, change, is, the, variation, in, global, or, regional, climates, over, time, it, reflects, changes, in, the, variability, or, average, state, of, the, atmosphere, over, time, scales, ranging, from, decades, to, millions, of, years, these, changes, can, be, caused, by, processes, internal, to, the, earth, external, forces, e, g, variations, in, sunlight, intensity, or, human, activities, as, found, recently, scientists, have, identified, earth, s, energy, imbalance, eei, to, be, a, fundamental, metric, of, the, status, of, global, change, in, recent, usage, especially, in, the, context, of, environmental, policy, the, term, climate, change, often, refers, only, to, changes, in, modern, climate, including, the, rise, in, average, surface, temperature, known, as, global, warming, in, some, cases, the, term, is, also, used, with, a, presumption, of, human, causation, as, in, the, united, nations, framework, convention, on, climate, change, unfccc, the, unfccc, uses, climate, variability, for, non, human, caused, variations, earth, has, undergone, periodic, climate, shifts, in, the, past, including, four, major, ice, ages, these, consist, of, glacial, periods, where, conditions, are, colder, than, normal, separated, by, interglacial, periods, the, accumulation, of, snow, and, ice, during, a, glacial, period, increases, the, surface, albedo, reflecting, more, of, the, sun, s, energy, into, space, and, maintaining, a, lower, atmospheric, temperature, increases, in, greenhouse, gases, such, as, by, volcanic, activity, can, increase, the, global, temperature, and, produce, an, interglacial, period, suggested, causes, of, ice, age, periods, include, the, positions, of, the, continents, variations, in, the, earth, s, orbit, changes, in, the, solar, output, and, volcanism, however, these, naturally, caused, changes, in, climate, occur, on, a, much, slower, time, scale, than, the, present, rate, of, change, which, is, caused, by, the, emission, of, greenhouse, gases, by, human, activities, according, to, the, eu, s, copernicus, climate, change, service, average, global, air, temperature, has, passed, 1, 5c, of, warming, the, period, from, february, 2023, to, january, 2024, climate, models, use, quantitative, methods, to, simulate, the, interactions, and, transfer, of, radiative, energy, between, the, atmosphere, oceans, land, surface, and, ice, through, a, series, of, physics, equations, they, are, used, for, a, variety, of, purposes, from, the, study, of, the, dynamics, of, the, weather, and, climate, system, to, projections, of, future, climate, all, climate, models, balance, or, very, nearly, balance, incoming, energy, as, short, wave, including, visible, electromagnetic, radiation, to, the, earth, with, outgoing, energy, as, long, wave, infrared, electromagnetic, radiation, from, the, earth, any, imbalance, results, in, a, change, in, the, average, temperature, of, the, earth, climate, models, are, available, on, different, resolutions, ranging, from, 100, km, to, 1, km, high, resolutions, in, global, climate, models, require, significant, computational, resources, and, so, only, a, few, global, datasets, exist, global, climate, models, can, be, dynamically, or, statistically, downscaled, to, regional, climate, models, to, analyze, impacts, of, climate, change, on, a, local, scale, examples, are, icon, or, mechanistically, downscaled, data, such, as, chelsa, climatologies, at, high, resolution, for, the, earth, s, land, surface, areas, the, most, talked, about, applications, of, these, models, in, recent, years, have, been, their, use, to, infer, the, consequences, of, increasing, greenhouse, gases, in, the, atmosphere, primarily, carbon, dioxide, see, greenhouse, gas, these, models, predict, an, upward, trend, in, the, global, mean, surface, temperature, with, the, most, rapid, increase, in, temperature, being, projected, for, the, higher, latitudes, of, the, northern, hemisphere, models, can, range, from, relatively, simple, to, quite, complex, simple, radiant, heat, transfer, models, treat, the,
