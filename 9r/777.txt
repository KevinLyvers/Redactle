jet, streams, are, fast, flowing, narrow, meandering, air, currents, in, the, atmospheres, of, the, earth, venus, jupiter, saturn, uranus, and, neptune, on, earth, the, main, jet, streams, are, located, near, the, altitude, of, the, tropopause, and, are, westerly, winds, flowing, west, to, east, jet, streams, may, start, stop, split, into, two, or, more, parts, combine, into, one, stream, or, flow, in, various, directions, including, opposite, to, the, direction, of, the, remainder, of, the, jet, the, strongest, jet, streams, are, the, polar, jets, around, the, polar, vortices, at, 9, 12, km, 5, 6, 7, 5, mi, 30, 000, 39, 000, ft, above, sea, level, and, the, higher, altitude, and, somewhat, weaker, subtropical, jets, at, 10, 16, km, 6, 2, 9, 9, mi, 33, 000, 52, 000, ft, the, northern, hemisphere, and, the, southern, hemisphere, each, have, a, polar, jet, and, a, subtropical, jet, the, northern, hemisphere, polar, jet, flows, over, the, middle, to, northern, latitudes, of, north, america, europe, and, asia, and, their, intervening, oceans, while, the, southern, hemisphere, polar, jet, mostly, circles, antarctica, both, all, year, round, jet, streams, are, the, product, of, two, factors, the, atmospheric, heating, by, solar, radiation, that, produces, the, large, scale, polar, ferrel, and, hadley, circulation, cells, and, the, action, of, the, coriolis, force, acting, on, those, moving, masses, the, coriolis, force, is, caused, by, the, planet, s, rotation, on, its, axis, on, other, planets, internal, heat, rather, than, solar, heating, drives, their, jet, streams, the, polar, jet, stream, forms, near, the, interface, of, the, polar, and, ferrel, circulation, cells, the, subtropical, jet, forms, near, the, boundary, of, the, ferrel, and, hadley, circulation, cells, other, jet, streams, also, exist, during, the, northern, hemisphere, summer, easterly, jets, can, form, in, tropical, regions, typically, where, dry, air, encounters, more, humid, air, at, high, altitudes, low, level, jets, also, are, typical, of, various, regions, such, as, the, central, united, states, there, are, also, jet, streams, in, the, thermosphere, meteorologists, use, the, location, of, some, of, the, jet, streams, as, an, aid, in, weather, forecasting, the, main, commercial, relevance, of, the, jet, streams, is, in, air, travel, as, flight, time, can, be, dramatically, affected, by, either, flying, with, the, flow, or, against, often, airlines, work, to, fly, with, the, jet, stream, to, obtain, significant, fuel, cost, and, time, savings, dynamic, north, atlantic, tracks, are, one, example, of, how, airlines, and, air, traffic, control, work, together, to, accommodate, the, jet, stream, and, winds, aloft, that, results, in, the, maximum, benefit, for, airlines, and, other, users, clear, air, turbulence, a, potential, hazard, to, aircraft, passenger, safety, is, often, found, in, a, jet, stream, s, vicinity, but, it, does, not, create, a, substantial, alteration, of, flight, times, the, first, indications, of, this, phenomenon, came, from, american, professor, elias, loomis, 1811, 1889, when, he, proposed, the, hypothesis, of, a, powerful, air, current, in, the, upper, air, blowing, west, to, east, across, the, united, states, as, an, explanation, for, the, behaviour, of, major, storms, after, the, 1883, eruption, of, the, krakatoa, volcano, weather, watchers, tracked, and, mapped, the, effects, on, the, sky, over, several, years, they, labelled, the, phenomenon, the, equatorial, smoke, stream, in, the, 1920s, japanese, meteorologist, wasaburo, oishi, detected, the, jet, stream, from, a, site, near, mount, fuji, he, tracked, pilot, balloons, pibals, used, to, measure, wind, speed, and, direction, as, they, rose, in, the, air, oishi, s, work, largely, went, unnoticed, outside, japan, because, it, was, published, in, esperanto, though, chronologically, he, has, to, be, credited, for, the, scientific, discovery, of, jet, streams, american, pilot, wiley, post, 1898, 1935, the, first, man, to, fly, around, the, world, solo, in, 1933, is, often, given, some, credit, for, discovery, of, jet, streams, post, invented, a, pressurized, suit, that, let, him, fly, above, 6, 200, metres, 20, 300, ft, in, the, year, before, his, death, post, made, several, attempts, at, a, high, altitude, transcontinental, flight, and, noticed, that, at, times, his, ground, speed, greatly, exceeded, his, air, speed, german, meteorologist, heinrich, seilkopf, is, credited, with, coining, a, special, term, strahlstr, mung, literally, jet, current, for, the, phenomenon, in, 1939, many, sources, credit, real, understanding, of, the, nature, of, jet, streams, to, regular, and, repeated, flight, path, traversals, during, world, war, ii, flyers, consistently, noticed, westerly, tailwinds, in, excess, of, 160, km, h, 100, mph, in, flights, for, example, from, the, us, to, the, uk, similarly, in, 1944, a, team, of, american, meteorologists, in, guam, including, reid, bryson, had, enough, observations, to, forecast, very, high, west, winds, that, would, slow, bombers, raiding, japan, polar, jet, streams, are, typically, located, near, the, 250, hpa, about, 1, 4, atmosphere, pressure, level, or, seven, to, twelve, kilometres, 23, 000, to, 39, 000, ft, above, sea, level, while, the, weaker, subtropical, jet, streams, are, much, higher, between, 10, and, 16, kilometres, 33, 000, and, 52, 000, ft, jet, streams, wander, laterally, dramatically, and, change, in, altitude, the, jet, streams, form, near, breaks, in, the, tropopause, at, the, transitions, between, the, polar, ferrel, and, hadley, circulation, cells, and, whose, circulation, with, the, coriolis, force, acting, on, those, masses, drives, the, jet, streams, the, polar, jets, at, lower, altitude, and, often, intruding, into, mid, latitudes, strongly, affect, weather, and, aviation, the, polar, jet, stream, is, most, commonly, found, between, latitudes, 30, and, 60, closer, to, 60, while, the, subtropical, jet, streams, are, located, close, to, latitude, 30, these, two, jets, merge, at, some, locations, and, times, while, at, other, times, they, are, well, separated, the, northern, polar, jet, stream, is, said, to, follow, the, sun, as, it, slowly, migrates, northward, as, that, hemisphere, warms, and, southward, again, as, it, cools, the, width, of, a, jet, stream, is, typically, a, few, hundred, kilometres, or, miles, and, its, vertical, thickness, often, less, than, five, kilometres, 16, 000, feet, jet, streams, are, typically, continuous, over, long, distances, but, discontinuities, are, also, common, the, path, of, the, jet, typically, has, a, meandering, shape, and, these, meanders, themselves, propagate, eastward, at, lower, speeds, than, that, of, the, actual, wind, within, the, flow, each, large, meander, or, wave, within, the, jet, stream, is, known, as, a, rossby, wave, planetary, wave, rossby, waves, are, caused, by, changes, in, the, coriolis, effect, with, latitude, shortwave, troughs, are, smaller, scale, waves, superimposed, on, the, rossby, waves, with, a, scale, of, 1, 000, to, 4, 000, kilometres, 600, 2, 500, mi, long, that, move, along, through, the, flow, pattern, around, large, scale, or, longwave, ridges, and, troughs, within, rossby, waves, jet, streams, can, split, into, two, when, they, encounter, an, upper, level, low, that, diverts, a, portion, of, the, jet, stream, under, its, base, while, the, remainder, of, the, jet, moves, by, to, its, north, the, wind, speeds, are, greatest, where, temperature, differences, between, air, masses, are, greatest, and, often, exceed, 92, km, h, 50, kn, 57, mph, speeds, of, 400, km, h, 220, kn, 250, mph, have, been, measured, the, jet, stream, moves, from, west, to, east, bringing, changes, of, weather, meteorologists, now, understand, that, the, path, of, jet, streams, affects, cyclonic, storm, systems, at, lower, levels, in, the, atmosphere, and, so, knowledge, of, their, course, has, become, an, important, part, of, weather, forecasting, for, example, in, 2007, and, 2012, britain, experienced, severe, flooding, as, a, result, of, the, polar, jet, staying, south, for, the, summer, in, general, winds, are, strongest, immediately, under, the, tropopause, except, locally, during, tornadoes, tropical, cyclones, or, other, anomalous, situations, if, two, air, masses, of, different, temperatures, or, densities, meet, the, resulting, pressure, difference, caused, by, the, density, difference, which, ultimately, causes, wind, is, highest, within, the, transition, zone, the, wind, does, not, flow, directly, from, the, hot, to, the, cold, area, but, is, deflected, by, the, coriolis, effect, and, flows, along, the, boundary, of, the, two, air, masses, all, these, facts, are, consequences, of, the, thermal, wind, relation, the, balance, of, forces, acting, on, an, atmospheric, air, parcel, in, the, vertical, direction, is, primarily, between, the, gravitational, force, acting, on, the, mass, of, the, parcel, and, the, buoyancy, force, or, the, difference, in, pressure, between, the, top, and, bottom, surfaces, of, the, parcel, any, imbalance, between, these, forces, results, in, the, acceleration, of, the, parcel, in, the, imbalance, direction, upward, if, the, buoyant, force, exceeds, the, weight, and, downward, if, the, weight, exceeds, the, buoyancy, force, the, balance, in, the, vertical, direction, is, referred, to, as, hydrostatic, beyond, the, tropics, the, dominant, forces, act, in, the, horizontal, direction, and, the, primary, struggle, is, between, the, coriolis, force, and, the, pressure, gradient, force, balance, between, these, two, forces, is, referred, to, as, geostrophic, given, both, hydrostatic, and, geostrophic, balance, one, can, derive, the, thermal, wind, relation, the, vertical, gradient, of, the, horizontal, wind, is, proportional, to, the, horizontal, temperature, gradient, if, two, air, masses, in, the, northern, hemisphere, one, cold, and, dense, to, the, north, and, the, other, hot, and, less, dense, to, the, south, are, separated, by, a, vertical, boundary, and, that, boundary, should, be, removed, the, difference, in, densities, will, result, in, the, cold, air, mass, slipping, under, the, hotter, and, less, dense, air, mass, the, coriolis, effect, will, then, cause, poleward, moving, mass, to, deviate, to, the, east, while, equatorward, moving, mass, will, deviate, toward, the, west, the, general, trend, in, the, atmosphere, is, for, temperatures, to, decrease, in, the, poleward, direction, as, a, result, winds, develop, an, eastward, component, and, that, component, grows, with, altitude, therefore, the, strong, eastward, moving, jet, streams, are, in, part, a, simple, consequence, of, the, fact, that, the, equator, is, warmer, than, the, north, and, south, poles, the, thermal, wind, relation, does, not, explain, why, the, winds, are, organized, into, tight, jets, rather, than, distributed, more, broadly, over, the, hemisphere, one, factor, that, contributes, to, the, creation, of, a, concentrated, polar, jet, is, the, undercutting, of, sub, tropical, air, masses, by, the, more, dense, polar, air, masses, at, the, polar, front, this, causes, a, sharp, north, south, pressure, south, north, potential, vorticity, gradient, in, the, horizontal, plane, an, effect, which, is, most, significant, during, double, rossby, wave, breaking, events, at, high, altitudes, lack, of, friction, allows, air, to, respond, freely, to, the, steep, pressure, gradient, with, low, pressure, at, high, altitude, over, the, pole, this, results, in, the, formation, of, planetary, wind, circulations, that, experience, a, strong, coriolis, deflection, and, thus, can, be, considered, quasi, geostrophic, the, polar, front, jet, stream, is, closely, linked, to, the, frontogenesis, process, in, midlatitudes, as, the, acceleration, deceleration, of, the, air, flow, induces, areas, of, low, high, pressure, respectively, which, link, to, the, formation, of, cyclones, and, anticyclones, along, the, polar, front, in, a, relatively, narrow, region, a, second, factor, which, contributes, to, a, concentrated, jet, is, more, applicable, to, the, subtropical, jet, which, forms, at, the, poleward, limit, of, the, tropical, hadley, cell, and, to, first, order, this, circulation, is, symmetric, with, respect, to, longitude, tropical, air, rises, to, the, tropopause, and, moves, poleward, before, sinking, this, is, the, hadley, cell, circulation, as, it, does, so, it, tends, to, conserve, angular, momentum, since, friction, with, the, ground, is, slight, air, masses, that, begin, moving, poleward, are, deflected, eastward, by, the, coriolis, force, true, for, either, hemisphere, which, for, poleward, moving, air, implies, an, increased, westerly, component, of, the, winds, note, that, deflection, is, leftward, in, the, southern, hemisphere, jupiter, s, atmosphere, has, multiple, jet, streams, caused, by, the, convection, cells, that, form, the, familiar, banded, color, structure, on, jupiter, these, convection, cells, are, driven, by, internal, heating, the, factors, that, control, the, number, of, jet, streams, in, a, planetary, atmosphere, is, an, active, area, of, research, in, dynamical, meteorology, in, models, as, one, increases, the, planetary, radius, holding, all, other, parameters, fixed, the, number, of, jet, streams, decreases, the, subtropical, jet, stream, rounding, the, base, of, the, mid, oceanic, upper, trough, is, thought, to, be, one, of, the, causes, most, of, the, hawaiian, islands, have, been, resistant, to, the, long, list, of, hawaii, hurricanes, that, have, approached, for, example, when, hurricane, flossie, 2007, approached, and, dissipated, just, before, reaching, landfall, the, u, s, national, oceanic, and, atmospheric, administration, noaa, cited, vertical, wind, shear, as, evidenced, in, the, photo, on, earth, the, northern, polar, jet, stream, is, the, most, important, one, for, aviation, and, weather, forecasting, as, it, is, much, stronger, and, at, a, much, lower, altitude, than, the, subtropical, jet, streams, and, also, covers, many, countries, in, the, northern, hemisphere, while, the, southern, polar, jet, stream, mostly, circles, antarctica, and, sometimes, the, southern, tip, of, south, america, thus, the, term, jet, stream, in, these, contexts, usually, implies, the, northern, polar, jet, stream, the, location, of, the, jet, stream, is, extremely, important, for, aviation, commercial, use, of, the, jet, stream, began, on, 18, november, 1952, when, pan, am, flew, from, tokyo, to, honolulu, at, an, altitude, of, 7, 600, metres, 24, 900, ft, it, cut, the, trip, time, by, over, one, third, from, 18, to, 11, 5, hours, not, only, does, it, cut, time, off, the, flight, it, also, nets, fuel, savings, for, the, airline, industry, within, north, america, the, time, needed, to, fly, east, across, the, continent, can, be, decreased, by, about, 30, minutes, if, an, airplane, can, fly, with, the, jet, stream, or, increased, by, more, than, that, amount, if, it, must, fly, west, against, it, associated, with, jet, streams, is, a, phenomenon, known, as, clear, air, turbulence, cat, caused, by, vertical, and, horizontal, wind, shear, caused, by, jet, streams, the, cat, is, strongest, on, the, cold, air, side, of, the, jet, next, to, and, just, under, the, axis, of, the, jet, clear, air, turbulence, can, cause, aircraft, to, plunge, and, so, present, a, passenger, safety, hazard, that, has, caused, fatal, accidents, such, as, the, death, of, one, passenger, on, united, airlines, flight, 826, unusual, wind, speed, in, the, jet, stream, in, late, february, 2024, pushed, commercial, jets, to, excess, of, 800, mph, 1, 300, km, h, 700, kn, in, their, flight, path, unheard, of, for, a, commercial, airliner, scientists, are, investigating, ways, to, harness, the, wind, energy, within, the, jet, stream, according, to, one, estimate, of, the, potential, wind, energy, in, the, jet, stream, only, one, percent, would, be, needed, to, meet, the, world, s, current, energy, needs, in, the, late, 2000s, it, was, estimated, that, the, required, technology, would, reportedly, take, 10, 20, years, to, develop, there, are, two, major, but, divergent, scientific, articles, about, jet, stream, power, archer, caldeira, claim, that, the, earth, s, jet, streams, could, generate, a, total, power, of, 1700, terawatts, tw, and, that, the, climatic, impact, of, harnessing, this, amount, would, be, negligible, however, miller, gans, kleidon, claim, that, the, jet, streams, could, generate, a, total, power, of, only, 7, 5, tw, and, that, the, climatic, impact, would, be, catastrophic, near, the, end, of, world, war, ii, from, late, 1944, until, early, 1945, the, japanese, fu, go, balloon, bomb, a, type, of, fire, balloon, was, designed, as, a, cheap, weapon, intended, to, make, use, of, the, jet, stream, over, the, pacific, ocean, to, reach, the, west, coast, of, canada, and, the, united, states, relatively, ineffective, as, weapons, they, were, used, in, one, of, the, few, attacks, on, north, america, during, world, war, ii, causing, six, deaths, and, a, small, amount, of, damage, american, scientists, studying, the, balloons, thought, the, japanese, might, be, preparing, a, biological, attack, el, ni, o, southern, oscillation, enso, influences, the, average, location, of, upper, level, jet, streams, and, leads, to, cyclical, variations, in, precipitation, and, temperature, across, north, america, as, well, as, affecting, tropical, cyclone, development, across, the, eastern, pacific, and, atlantic, basins, combined, with, the, pacific, decadal, oscillation, enso, can, also, impact, cold, season, rainfall, in, europe, changes, in, enso, also, change, the, location, of, the, jet, stream, over, south, america, which, partially, affects, precipitation, distribution, over, the, continent, during, el, ni, o, events, increased, precipitation, is, expected, in, california, due, to, a, more, southerly, zonal, storm, track, during, the, ni, o, portion, of, enso, increased, precipitation, falls, along, the, gulf, coast, and, southeast, due, to, a, stronger, than, normal, and, more, southerly, polar, jet, stream, snowfall, is, greater, than, average, across, the, southern, rockies, and, sierra, nevada, mountain, range, and, is, well, below, normal, across, the, upper, midwest, and, great, lakes, states, the, northern, tier, of, the, lower, 48, exhibits, above, normal, temperatures, during, the, fall, and, winter, while, the, gulf, coast, experiences, below, normal, temperatures, during, the, winter, season, the, subtropical, jet, stream, across, the, deep, tropics, of, the, northern, hemisphere, is, enhanced, due, to, increased, convection, in, the, equatorial, pacific, which, decreases, tropical, cyclogenesis, within, the, atlantic, tropics, below, what, is, normal, and, increases, tropical, cyclone, activity, across, the, eastern, pacific, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, subtropical, jet, stream, is, displaced, equatorward, or, north, of, its, normal, position, which, diverts, frontal, systems, and, thunderstorm, complexes, from, reaching, central, portions, of, the, continent, across, north, america, during, la, ni, a, increased, precipitation, is, diverted, into, the, pacific, northwest, due, to, a, more, northerly, storm, track, and, jet, stream, the, storm, track, shifts, far, enough, northward, to, bring, wetter, than, normal, conditions, in, the, form, of, increased, snowfall, to, the, midwestern, states, as, well, as, hot, and, dry, summers, snowfall, is, above, normal, across, the, pacific, northwest, and, western, great, lakes, across, the, north, atlantic, the, jet, stream, is, stronger, than, normal, which, directs, stronger, systems, with, increased, precipitation, towards, europe, evidence, suggests, the, jet, stream, was, at, least, partly, responsible, for, the, widespread, drought, conditions, during, the, 1930s, dust, bowl, in, the, midwest, united, states, normally, the, jet, stream, flows, east, over, the, gulf, of, mexico, and, turns, northward, pulling, up, moisture, and, dumping, rain, onto, the, great, plains, during, the, dust, bowl, the, jet, stream, weakened, and, changed, course, traveling, farther, south, than, normal, this, starved, the, great, plains, and, other, areas, of, the, midwest, of, rainfall, causing, extraordinary, drought, conditions, since, the, early, 2000s, climate, models, have, consistently, identified, that, global, warming, will, gradually, push, jet, streams, poleward, in, 2008, this, was, confirmed, by, observational, evidence, which, proved, that, from, 1979, to, 2001, the, northern, jet, stream, moved, northward, at, an, average, rate, of, 2, 01, kilometres, 1, 25, mi, per, year, with, a, similar, trend, in, the, southern, hemisphere, jet, stream, climate, scientists, have, hypothesized, that, the, jet, stream, will, also, gradually, weaken, as, a, result, of, global, warming, trends, such, as, arctic, sea, ice, decline, reduced, snow, cover, evapotranspiration, patterns, and, other, weather, anomalies, have, caused, the, arctic, to, heat, up, faster, than, other, parts, of, the, globe, in, what, is, known, as, the, arctic, amplification, in, 2021, 2022, it, was, found, that, since, 1979, the, warming, within, the, arctic, circle, has, been, nearly, four, times, faster, than, the, global, average, and, some, hotspots, in, the, barents, sea, area, warmed, up, to, seven, times, faster, than, the, global, average, while, the, arctic, remains, one, of, the, coldest, places, on, earth, today, the, temperature, gradient, between, it, and, the, warmer, parts, of, the, globe, will, continue, to, diminish, with, every, decade, of, global, warming, as, the, result, of, this, amplification, if, this, gradient, has, a, strong, influence, on, the, jet, stream, then, it, will, eventually, become, weaker, and, more, variable, in, its, course, which, would, allow, more, cold, air, from, the, polar, vortex, to, leak, mid, latitudes, and, slow, the, progression, of, rossby, waves, leading, to, more, persistent, and, more, extreme, weather, the, hypothesis, above, is, closely, associated, with, jennifer, francis, who, had, first, proposed, it, in, a, 2012, paper, co, authored, by, stephen, j, vavrus, while, some, paleoclimate, reconstructions, have, suggested, that, the, polar, vortex, becomes, more, variable, and, causes, more, unstable, weather, during, periods, of, warming, back, in, 1997, this, was, contradicted, by, climate, modelling, with, pmip2, simulations, finding, in, 2010, that, the, arctic, oscillation, was, much, weaker, and, more, negative, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, and, suggesting, that, warmer, periods, have, stronger, positive, phase, ao, and, thus, less, frequent, leaks, of, the, polar, vortex, air, however, a, 2012, review, in, the, journal, of, the, atmospheric, sciences, noted, that, there, a, significant, change, in, the, vortex, mean, state, over, the, twenty, first, century, resulting, in, a, weaker, more, disturbed, vortex, which, contradicted, the, modelling, results, but, fit, the, francis, vavrus, hypothesis, additionally, a, 2013, study, noted, that, the, then, current, cmip5, tended, to, strongly, underestimate, winter, blocking, trends, and, other, 2012, research, had, suggested, a, connection, between, declining, arctic, sea, ice, and, heavy, snowfall, during, midlatitude, winters, in, 2013, further, research, from, francis, connected, reductions, in, the, arctic, sea, ice, to, extreme, summer, weather, in, the, northern, mid, latitudes, while, other, research, from, that, year, identified, potential, linkages, between, arctic, sea, ice, trends, and, more, extreme, rainfall, in, the, european, summer, at, the, time, it, was, also, suggested, that, this, connection, between, arctic, amplification, and, jet, stream, patterns, was, involved, in, the, formation, of, hurricane, sandy, and, played, a, role, in, the, early, 2014, north, american, cold, wave, in, 2015, francis, next, study, concluded, that, highly, amplified, jet, stream, patterns, are, occurring, more, frequently, in, the, past, two, decades, hence, continued, heat, trapping, emissions, favour, increased, formation, of, extreme, events, caused, by, prolonged, weather, conditions, studies, published, in, 2017, and, 2018, identified, stalling, patterns, of, rossby, waves, in, the, northern, hemisphere, jet, stream, as, the, culprit, behind, other, almost, stationary, extreme, weather, events, such, as, the, 2018, european, heatwave, the, 2003, european, heat, wave, 2010, russian, heat, wave, or, the, 2010, pakistan, floods, and, suggested, that, these, patterns, were, all, connected, to, arctic, amplification, further, work, from, francis, and, vavrus, that, year, suggested, that, amplified, arctic, warming, is, observed, as, stronger, in, lower, atmospheric, areas, because, the, expanding, process, of, warmer, air, increases, pressure, levels, which, decreases, poleward, geopotential, height, gradients, as, these, gradients, are, the, reason, that, cause, west, to, east, winds, through, the, thermal, wind, relationship, declining, speeds, are, usually, found, south, of, the, areas, with, geopotential, increases, in, 2017, francis, explained, her, findings, to, the, scientific, american, a, lot, more, water, vapor, is, being, transported, northward, by, big, swings, in, the, jet, stream, that, s, important, because, water, vapor, is, a, greenhouse, gas, just, like, carbon, dioxide, and, methane, it, traps, heat, in, the, atmosphere, that, vapor, also, condenses, as, droplets, we, know, as, clouds, which, themselves, trap, more, heat, the, vapor, is, a, big, part, of, the, amplification, story, a, big, reason, the, arctic, is, warming, faster, than, anywhere, else, in, a, 2017, study, conducted, by, climatologist, judah, cohen, and, several, of, his, research, associates, cohen, wrote, that, shift, in, polar, vortex, states, can, account, for, most, of, the, recent, winter, cooling, trends, over, eurasian, midlatitudes, a, 2018, paper, from, vavrus, and, others, linked, arctic, amplification, to, more, persistent, hot, dry, extremes, during, the, midlatitude, summers, as, well, as, the, midlatitude, winter, continental, cooling, another, 2017, paper, estimated, that, when, the, arctic, experiences, anomalous, warming, primary, production, in, north, america, goes, down, by, between, 1, and, 4, on, average, with, some, states, suffering, up, to, 20, losses, a, 2021, study, found, that, a, stratospheric, polar, vortex, disruption, is, linked, with, extreme, cold, winter, weather, across, parts, of, asia, and, north, america, including, the, february, 2021, north, american, cold, wave, another, 2021, study, identified, a, connection, between, the, arctic, sea, ice, loss, and, the, increased, size, of, wildfires, in, the, western, united, states, however, because, the, specific, observations, are, considered, short, term, observations, there, is, considerable, uncertainty, in, the, conclusions, climatology, observations, require, several, decades, to, definitively, distinguish, various, forms, of, natural, variability, from, climate, trends, this, point, was, stressed, by, reviews, in, 2013, and, in, 2017, a, study, in, 2014, concluded, that, arctic, amplification, significantly, decreased, cold, season, temperature, variability, over, the, northern, hemisphere, in, recent, decades, cold, arctic, air, intrudes, into, the, warmer, lower, latitudes, more, rapidly, today, during, autumn, and, winter, a, trend, projected, to, continue, in, the, future, except, during, summer, thus, calling, into, question, whether, winters, will, bring, more, cold, extremes, a, 2019, analysis, of, a, data, set, collected, from, 35, 182, weather, stations, worldwide, including, 9116, whose, records, go, beyond, 50, years, found, a, sharp, decrease, in, northern, midlatitude, cold, waves, since, the, 1980s, moreover, a, range, of, long, term, observational, data, collected, during, the, 2010s, and, published, in, 2020, suggests, that, the, intensification, of, arctic, amplification, since, the, early, 2010s, was, not, linked, to, significant, changes, on, mid, latitude, atmospheric, patterns, state, of, the, art, modelling, research, of, pamip, polar, amplification, model, intercomparison, project, improved, upon, the, 2010, findings, of, pmip2, it, found, that, sea, ice, decline, would, weaken, the, jet, stream, and, increase, the, probability, of, atmospheric, blocking, but, the, connection, was, very, minor, and, typically, insignificant, next, to, interannual, variability, in, 2022, a, follow, up, study, found, that, while, the, pamip, average, had, likely, underestimated, the, weakening, caused, by, sea, ice, decline, by, 1, 2, to, 3, times, even, the, corrected, connection, still, amounts, to, only, 10, of, the, jet, stream, s, natural, variability, additionally, a, 2021, study, found, that, while, jet, streams, had, indeed, slowly, moved, polewards, since, 1960, as, was, predicted, by, models, they, did, not, weaken, in, spite, of, a, small, increase, in, waviness, a, 2022, re, analysis, of, the, aircraft, observational, data, collected, over, 2002, 2020, suggested, that, the, north, atlantic, jet, stream, had, actually, strengthened, finally, a, 2021, study, was, able, to, reconstruct, jet, stream, patterns, over, the, past, 1, 250, years, based, on, greenland, ice, cores, and, found, that, all, of, the, recently, observed, changes, remain, within, range, of, natural, variability, the, earliest, likely, time, of, divergence, is, in, 2060, under, the, representative, concentration, pathway, 8, 5, which, implies, continually, accelerating, greenhouse, gas, emissions, the, polar, night, jet, stream, forms, mainly, during, the, winter, months, when, the, nights, are, much, longer, hence, polar, nights, in, their, respective, hemispheres, at, around, 60, latitude, the, polar, night, jet, moves, at, a, greater, height, about, 24, 000, metres, 80, 000, ft, than, it, does, during, the, summer, during, these, dark, months, the, air, high, over, the, poles, becomes, much, colder, than, the, air, over, the, equator, this, difference, in, temperature, gives, rise, to, extreme, air, pressure, differences, in, the, stratosphere, which, when, combined, with, the, coriolis, effect, create, the, polar, night, jets, that, race, eastward, at, an, altitude, of, about, 48, kilometres, 30, mi, the, polar, vortex, is, circled, by, the, polar, night, jet, the, warmer, air, can, only, move, along, the, edge, of, the, polar, vortex, but, not, enter, it, within, the, vortex, the, cold, polar, air, becomes, increasingly, cold, with, neither, warmer, air, from, lower, latitudes, nor, energy, from, the, sun, entering, during, the, polar, night, there, are, wind, maxima, at, lower, levels, of, the, atmosphere, that, are, also, referred, to, as, jets, a, barrier, jet, in, the, low, levels, forms, just, upstream, of, mountain, chains, with, the, mountains, forcing, the, jet, to, be, oriented, parallel, to, the, mountains, the, mountain, barrier, increases, the, strength, of, the, low, level, wind, by, 45, percent, in, the, north, american, great, plains, a, southerly, low, level, jet, helps, fuel, overnight, thunderstorm, activity, during, the, warm, season, normally, in, the, form, of, mesoscale, convective, systems, which, form, during, the, overnight, hours, a, similar, phenomenon, develops, across, australia, which, pulls, moisture, poleward, from, the, coral, sea, towards, cut, off, lows, which, form, mainly, across, southwestern, portions, of, the, continent, coastal, low, level, jets, are, related, to, a, sharp, contrast, between, high, temperatures, over, land, and, lower, temperatures, over, the, sea, and, play, an, important, role, in, coastal, weather, giving, rise, to, strong, coast, parallel, winds, most, coastal, jets, are, associated, with, the, oceanic, high, pressure, systems, and, thermal, low, over, land, these, jets, are, mainly, located, along, cold, eastern, boundary, marine, currents, in, upwelling, regions, offshore, california, peru, chile, benguela, portugal, canary, and, west, australia, and, offshore, yemen, oman, a, valley, exit, jet, is, a, strong, down, valley, elevated, air, current, that, emerges, above, the, intersection, of, the, valley, and, its, adjacent, plain, these, winds, frequently, reach, speeds, of, up, to, 20, m, s, 72, km, h, 45, mph, at, heights, of, 40, 200, m, 130, 660, ft, above, the, ground, surface, winds, below, the, jet, tend, to, be, substantially, weaker, even, when, they, are, strong, enough, to, sway, vegetation, valley, exit, jets, are, likely, to, be, found, in, valley, regions, that, exhibit, diurnal, mountain, wind, systems, such, as, those, of, the, dry, mountain, ranges, of, the, us, deep, valleys, that, terminate, abruptly, at, a, plain, are, more, impacted, by, these, factors, than, are, those, that, gradually, become, shallower, as, downvalley, distance, increases, there, are, several, important, low, level, jets, in, africa, numerous, low, level, jets, form, in, the, sahara, and, are, important, for, the, raising, of, dust, off, the, desert, surface, this, includes, a, low, level, jet, in, chad, which, is, responsible, for, dust, emission, from, the, bod, l, depression, the, world, s, most, important, single, source, of, dust, emission, the, somali, jet, which, forms, off, the, east, african, coast, is, an, important, component, of, the, global, hadley, circulation, and, supplies, water, vapour, to, the, asian, monsoon, easterly, low, level, jets, forming, in, valleys, within, the, east, african, rift, system, help, account, for, the, low, rainfall, in, east, africa, and, support, high, rainfall, in, the, congo, basin, rainforest, the, formation, of, the, thermal, low, over, northern, africa, leads, to, a, low, level, westerly, jet, stream, from, june, into, october, which, provides, the, moist, inflow, to, the, west, african, monsoon, while, not, technically, a, low, level, jet, the, mid, level, african, easterly, jet, at, 3000, 4000, m, above, the, surface, is, also, an, important, climate, feature, in, africa, it, occurs, during, the, northern, hemisphere, summer, between, 10, n, and, 20, n, above, in, the, sahel, region, of, west, africa, the, mid, level, easterly, african, jet, stream, is, considered, to, play, a, crucial, role, in, the, west, african, monsoon, and, helps, form, the, tropical, waves, which, move, across, the, tropical, atlantic, and, eastern, pacific, oceans, during, the, warm, season
