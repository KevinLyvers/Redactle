an, impact, event, is, a, collision, between, astronomical, objects, causing, measurable, effects, impact, events, have, been, found, to, regularly, occur, in, planetary, systems, though, the, most, frequent, involve, asteroids, comets, or, meteoroids, and, have, minimal, effect, when, large, objects, impact, terrestrial, planets, such, as, the, earth, there, can, be, significant, physical, and, biospheric, consequences, as, the, impacting, body, is, usually, traveling, at, several, kilometres, a, second, a, minimum, of, 11, 2, km, s, 7, 0, mi, s, for, an, earth, impacting, body, though, atmospheres, mitigate, many, surface, impacts, through, atmospheric, entry, impact, craters, and, structures, are, dominant, landforms, on, many, of, the, solar, system, s, solid, objects, and, present, the, strongest, empirical, evidence, for, their, frequency, and, scale, impact, events, appear, to, have, played, a, significant, role, in, the, evolution, of, the, solar, system, since, its, formation, major, impact, events, have, significantly, shaped, earth, s, history, and, have, been, implicated, in, the, formation, of, the, earth, moon, system, impact, events, also, appear, to, have, played, a, significant, role, in, the, evolutionary, history, of, life, impacts, may, have, helped, deliver, the, building, blocks, for, life, the, panspermia, theory, relies, on, this, premise, impacts, have, been, suggested, as, the, origin, of, water, on, earth, they, have, also, been, implicated, in, several, mass, extinctions, the, prehistoric, chicxulub, impact, 66, million, years, ago, is, believed, to, not, only, be, the, cause, of, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, but, acceleration, of, the, evolution, of, mammals, leading, to, their, dominance, and, in, turn, setting, in, place, conditions, for, the, eventual, rise, of, humans, throughout, recorded, history, hundreds, of, earth, impacts, and, exploding, bolides, have, been, reported, with, some, occurrences, causing, deaths, injuries, property, damage, or, other, significant, localised, consequences, one, of, the, best, known, recorded, events, in, modern, times, was, the, tunguska, event, which, occurred, in, siberia, russia, in, 1908, the, 2013, chelyabinsk, meteor, event, is, the, only, known, such, incident, in, modern, times, to, result, in, numerous, injuries, its, meteor, is, the, largest, recorded, object, to, have, encountered, the, earth, since, the, tunguska, event, the, comet, shoemaker, levy, 9, impact, provided, the, first, direct, observation, of, an, extraterrestrial, collision, of, solar, system, objects, when, the, comet, broke, apart, and, collided, with, jupiter, in, july, 1994, an, extrasolar, impact, was, observed, in, 2013, when, a, massive, terrestrial, planet, impact, was, detected, around, the, star, id8, in, the, star, cluster, ngc, 2547, by, nasa, s, spitzer, space, telescope, and, confirmed, by, ground, observations, impact, events, have, been, a, plot, and, background, element, in, science, fiction, in, april, 2018, the, b612, foundation, reported, it, s, 100, percent, certain, we, ll, be, hit, but, we, re, not, 100, percent, certain, when, also, in, 2018, physicist, stephen, hawking, considered, in, his, final, book, brief, answers, to, the, big, questions, that, an, asteroid, collision, was, the, biggest, threat, to, the, planet, in, june, 2018, the, us, national, science, and, technology, council, warned, that, america, is, unprepared, for, an, asteroid, impact, event, and, has, developed, and, released, the, national, near, earth, object, preparedness, strategy, action, plan, to, better, prepare, according, to, expert, testimony, in, the, united, states, congress, in, 2013, nasa, would, require, at, least, five, years, of, preparation, before, a, mission, to, intercept, an, asteroid, could, be, launched, on, 26, september, 2022, the, double, asteroid, redirection, test, demonstrated, the, deflection, of, an, asteroid, it, was, the, first, such, experiment, to, be, carried, out, by, humankind, and, was, considered, to, be, highly, successful, the, orbital, period, of, the, target, body, was, changed, by, 32, minutes, the, criterion, for, success, was, a, change, of, more, than, 73, seconds, major, impact, events, have, significantly, shaped, earth, s, history, having, been, implicated, in, the, formation, of, the, earth, moon, system, the, evolutionary, history, of, life, the, origin, of, water, on, earth, and, several, mass, extinctions, impact, structures, are, the, result, of, impact, events, on, solid, objects, and, as, the, dominant, landforms, on, many, of, the, system, s, solid, objects, present, the, most, solid, evidence, of, prehistoric, events, notable, impact, events, include, the, hypothesized, late, heavy, bombardment, which, would, have, occurred, early, in, the, history, of, the, earth, moon, system, and, the, confirmed, chicxulub, impact, 66, million, years, ago, believed, to, be, the, cause, of, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, small, objects, frequently, collide, with, earth, there, is, an, inverse, relationship, between, the, size, of, the, object, and, the, frequency, of, such, events, the, lunar, cratering, record, shows, that, the, frequency, of, impacts, decreases, as, approximately, the, cube, of, the, resulting, crater, s, diameter, which, is, on, average, proportional, to, the, diameter, of, the, impactor, asteroids, with, a, 1, km, 0, 62, mi, diameter, strike, earth, every, 500, 000, years, on, average, large, collisions, with, 5, km, 3, mi, objects, happen, approximately, once, every, twenty, million, years, the, last, known, impact, of, an, object, of, 10, km, 6, mi, or, more, in, diameter, was, at, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, 66, million, years, ago, the, energy, released, by, an, impactor, depends, on, diameter, density, velocity, and, angle, the, diameter, of, most, near, earth, asteroids, that, have, not, been, studied, by, radar, or, infrared, can, generally, only, be, estimated, within, about, a, factor, of, two, by, basing, it, on, the, asteroid, s, brightness, the, density, is, generally, assumed, because, the, diameter, and, mass, from, which, density, can, be, calculated, are, also, generally, estimated, due, to, earth, s, escape, velocity, the, minimum, impact, velocity, is, 11, km, s, with, asteroid, impacts, averaging, around, 17, km, s, on, the, earth, the, most, probable, impact, angle, is, 45, degrees, impact, conditions, such, as, asteroid, size, and, speed, but, also, density, and, impact, angle, determine, the, kinetic, energy, released, in, an, impact, event, the, more, energy, is, released, the, more, damage, is, likely, to, occur, on, the, ground, due, to, the, environmental, effects, triggered, by, the, impact, such, effects, can, be, shock, waves, heat, radiation, the, formation, of, craters, with, associated, earthquakes, and, tsunamis, if, bodies, of, water, are, hit, human, populations, are, vulnerable, to, these, effects, if, they, live, within, the, affected, zone, large, seiche, waves, arising, from, earthquakes, and, large, scale, deposit, of, debris, can, also, occur, within, minutes, of, impact, thousands, of, kilometres, from, impact, stony, asteroids, with, a, diameter, of, 4, meters, 13, ft, enter, earth, s, atmosphere, about, once, a, year, asteroids, with, a, diameter, of, 7, meters, enter, the, atmosphere, about, every, 5, years, with, as, much, kinetic, energy, as, the, atomic, bomb, dropped, on, hiroshima, approximately, 16, kilotons, of, tnt, but, the, air, burst, is, reduced, to, just, 5, kilotons, these, ordinarily, explode, in, the, upper, atmosphere, and, most, or, all, of, the, solids, are, vaporized, however, asteroids, with, a, diameter, of, 20, m, 66, ft, and, which, strike, earth, approximately, twice, every, century, produce, more, powerful, airbursts, the, 2013, chelyabinsk, meteor, was, estimated, to, be, about, 20, m, in, diameter, with, an, airburst, of, around, 500, kilotons, an, explosion, 30, times, the, hiroshima, bomb, impact, much, larger, objects, may, impact, the, solid, earth, and, create, a, crater, objects, with, a, diameter, less, than, 1, m, 3, 3, ft, are, called, meteoroids, and, seldom, make, it, to, the, ground, to, become, meteorites, an, estimated, 500, meteorites, reach, the, surface, each, year, but, only, 5, or, 6, of, these, typically, create, a, weather, radar, signature, with, a, strewn, field, large, enough, to, be, recovered, and, be, made, known, to, scientists, the, late, eugene, shoemaker, of, the, u, s, geological, survey, estimated, the, rate, of, earth, impacts, concluding, that, an, event, about, the, size, of, the, nuclear, weapon, that, destroyed, hiroshima, occurs, about, once, a, year, such, events, would, seem, to, be, spectacularly, obvious, but, they, generally, go, unnoticed, for, a, number, of, reasons, the, majority, of, the, earth, s, surface, is, covered, by, water, a, good, portion, of, the, land, surface, is, uninhabited, and, the, explosions, generally, occur, at, relatively, high, altitude, resulting, in, a, huge, flash, and, thunderclap, but, no, real, damage, although, no, human, is, known, to, have, been, killed, directly, by, an, impact, over, 1000, people, were, injured, by, the, chelyabinsk, meteor, airburst, event, over, russia, in, 2013, in, 2005, it, was, estimated, that, the, chance, of, a, single, person, born, today, dying, due, to, an, impact, is, around, 1, in, 200, 000, the, two, to, four, meter, sized, asteroids, 2008, tc, 3, 2014, aa, 2018, la, 2019, mo, 2022, eb5, and, the, suspected, artificial, satellite, wt1190f, are, the, only, known, objects, to, be, detected, before, impacting, the, earth, impacts, have, had, during, the, history, of, the, earth, a, significant, geological, and, climatic, influence, the, moon, s, existence, is, widely, attributed, to, a, huge, impact, early, in, earth, s, history, impact, events, earlier, in, the, history, of, earth, have, been, credited, with, creative, as, well, as, destructive, events, it, has, been, proposed, that, impacting, comets, delivered, the, earth, s, water, and, some, have, suggested, that, the, origins, of, life, may, have, been, influenced, by, impacting, objects, by, bringing, organic, chemicals, or, lifeforms, to, the, earth, s, surface, a, theory, known, as, exogenesis, these, modified, views, of, earth, s, history, did, not, emerge, until, relatively, recently, chiefly, due, to, a, lack, of, direct, observations, and, the, difficulty, in, recognizing, the, signs, of, an, earth, impact, because, of, erosion, and, weathering, large, scale, terrestrial, impacts, of, the, sort, that, produced, the, barringer, crater, locally, known, as, meteor, crater, east, of, flagstaff, arizona, are, rare, instead, it, was, widely, thought, that, cratering, was, the, result, of, volcanism, the, barringer, crater, for, example, was, ascribed, to, a, prehistoric, volcanic, explosion, not, an, unreasonable, hypothesis, given, that, the, volcanic, san, francisco, peaks, stand, only, 48, km, or, 30, mi, to, the, west, similarly, the, craters, on, the, surface, of, the, moon, were, ascribed, to, volcanism, it, was, not, until, 1903, 1905, that, the, barringer, crater, was, correctly, identified, as, an, impact, crater, and, it, was, not, until, as, recently, as, 1963, that, research, by, eugene, merle, shoemaker, conclusively, proved, this, hypothesis, the, findings, of, late, 20th, century, space, exploration, and, the, work, of, scientists, such, as, shoemaker, demonstrated, that, impact, cratering, was, by, far, the, most, widespread, geological, process, at, work, on, the, solar, system, s, solid, bodies, every, surveyed, solid, body, in, the, solar, system, was, found, to, be, cratered, and, there, was, no, reason, to, believe, that, the, earth, had, somehow, escaped, bombardment, from, space, in, the, last, few, decades, of, the, 20th, century, a, large, number, of, highly, modified, impact, craters, began, to, be, identified, the, first, direct, observation, of, a, major, impact, event, occurred, in, 1994, the, collision, of, the, comet, shoemaker, levy, 9, with, jupiter, based, on, crater, formation, rates, determined, from, the, earth, s, closest, celestial, partner, the, moon, astrogeologists, have, determined, that, during, the, last, 600, million, years, the, earth, has, been, struck, by, 60, objects, of, a, diameter, of, 5, km, 3, mi, or, more, the, smallest, of, these, impactors, would, leave, a, crater, almost, 100, km, 60, mi, across, only, three, confirmed, craters, from, that, time, period, with, that, size, or, greater, have, been, found, chicxulub, popigai, and, manicouagan, and, all, three, have, been, suspected, of, being, linked, to, extinction, events, though, only, chicxulub, the, largest, of, the, three, has, been, consistently, considered, the, impact, that, caused, mistastin, crater, generated, temperatures, exceeding, 2, 370, c, the, highest, known, to, have, occurred, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, besides, the, direct, effect, of, asteroid, impacts, on, a, planet, s, surface, topography, global, climate, and, life, recent, studies, have, shown, that, several, consecutive, impacts, might, have, an, effect, on, the, dynamo, mechanism, at, a, planet, s, core, responsible, for, maintaining, the, magnetic, field, of, the, planet, and, may, have, contributed, to, mars, lack, of, current, magnetic, field, an, impact, event, may, cause, a, mantle, plume, volcanism, at, the, antipodal, point, of, the, impact, the, chicxulub, impact, may, have, increased, volcanism, at, mid, ocean, ridges, and, has, been, proposed, to, have, triggered, flood, basalt, volcanism, at, the, deccan, traps, while, numerous, impact, craters, have, been, confirmed, on, land, or, in, the, shallow, seas, over, continental, shelves, no, impact, craters, in, the, deep, ocean, have, been, widely, accepted, by, the, scientific, community, impacts, of, projectiles, as, large, as, one, km, in, diameter, are, generally, thought, to, explode, before, reaching, the, sea, floor, but, it, is, unknown, what, would, happen, if, a, much, larger, impactor, struck, the, deep, ocean, the, lack, of, a, crater, however, does, not, mean, that, an, ocean, impact, would, not, have, dangerous, implications, for, humanity, some, scholars, have, argued, that, an, impact, event, in, an, ocean, or, sea, may, create, a, megatsunami, which, can, cause, destruction, both, at, sea, and, on, land, along, the, coast, but, this, is, disputed, the, eltanin, impact, into, the, pacific, ocean, 2, 5, mya, is, thought, to, involve, an, object, about, 1, to, 4, kilometres, 0, 62, to, 2, 49, mi, across, but, remains, craterless, the, effect, of, impact, events, on, the, biosphere, has, been, the, subject, of, scientific, debate, several, theories, of, impact, related, mass, extinction, have, been, developed, in, the, past, 500, million, years, there, have, been, five, generally, accepted, major, mass, extinctions, that, on, average, extinguished, half, of, all, species, one, of, the, largest, mass, extinctions, to, have, affected, life, on, earth, was, the, permian, triassic, which, ended, the, permian, period, 250, million, years, ago, and, killed, off, 90, percent, of, all, species, life, on, earth, took, 30, million, years, to, recover, the, cause, of, the, permian, triassic, extinction, is, still, a, matter, of, debate, the, age, and, origin, of, proposed, impact, craters, i, e, the, bedout, high, structure, hypothesized, to, be, associated, with, it, are, still, controversial, the, last, such, mass, extinction, led, to, the, demise, of, the, non, avian, dinosaurs, and, coincided, with, a, large, meteorite, impact, this, is, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, also, known, as, the, k, t, or, k, pg, extinction, event, which, occurred, 66, million, years, ago, there, is, no, definitive, evidence, of, impacts, leading, to, the, three, other, major, mass, extinctions, in, 1980, physicist, luis, alvarez, his, son, geologist, walter, alvarez, and, nuclear, chemists, frank, asaro, and, helen, v, michael, from, the, university, of, california, berkeley, discovered, unusually, high, concentrations, of, iridium, in, a, specific, layer, of, rock, strata, in, the, earth, s, crust, iridium, is, an, element, that, is, rare, on, earth, but, relatively, abundant, in, many, meteorites, from, the, amount, and, distribution, of, iridium, present, in, the, 65, million, year, old, iridium, layer, the, alvarez, team, later, estimated, that, an, asteroid, of, 10, to, 14, km, 6, to, 9, mi, must, have, collided, with, earth, this, iridium, layer, at, the, cretaceous, paleogene, boundary, has, been, found, worldwide, at, 100, different, sites, multidirectionally, shocked, quartz, coesite, which, is, normally, associated, with, large, impact, events, or, atomic, bomb, explosions, has, also, been, found, in, the, same, layer, at, more, than, 30, sites, soot, and, ash, at, levels, tens, of, thousands, times, normal, levels, were, found, with, the, above, anomalies, in, chromium, isotopic, ratios, found, within, the, k, t, boundary, layer, strongly, support, the, impact, theory, chromium, isotopic, ratios, are, homogeneous, within, the, earth, and, therefore, these, isotopic, anomalies, exclude, a, volcanic, origin, which, has, also, been, proposed, as, a, cause, for, the, iridium, enrichment, further, the, chromium, isotopic, ratios, measured, in, the, k, t, boundary, are, similar, to, the, chromium, isotopic, ratios, found, in, carbonaceous, chondrites, thus, a, probable, candidate, for, the, impactor, is, a, carbonaceous, asteroid, but, a, comet, is, also, possible, because, comets, are, assumed, to, consist, of, material, similar, to, carbonaceous, chondrites, probably, the, most, convincing, evidence, for, a, worldwide, catastrophe, was, the, discovery, of, the, crater, which, has, since, been, named, chicxulub, crater, this, crater, is, centered, on, the, yucat, n, peninsula, of, mexico, and, was, discovered, by, tony, camargo, and, glen, penfield, while, working, as, geophysicists, for, the, mexican, oil, company, pemex, what, they, reported, as, a, circular, feature, later, turned, out, to, be, a, crater, estimated, to, be, 180, km, 110, mi, in, diameter, this, convinced, the, vast, majority, of, scientists, that, this, extinction, resulted, from, a, point, event, that, is, most, probably, an, extraterrestrial, impact, and, not, from, increased, volcanism, and, climate, change, which, would, spread, its, main, effect, over, a, much, longer, time, period, although, there, is, now, general, agreement, that, there, was, a, huge, impact, at, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, that, led, to, the, iridium, enrichment, of, the, k, t, boundary, layer, remnants, have, been, found, of, other, smaller, impacts, some, nearing, half, the, size, of, the, chicxulub, crater, which, did, not, result, in, any, mass, extinctions, and, there, is, no, clear, linkage, between, an, impact, and, any, other, incident, of, mass, extinction, paleontologists, david, m, raup, and, jack, sepkoski, have, proposed, that, an, excess, of, extinction, events, occurs, roughly, every, 26, million, years, though, many, are, relatively, minor, this, led, physicist, richard, a, muller, to, suggest, that, these, extinctions, could, be, due, to, a, hypothetical, companion, star, to, the, sun, called, nemesis, periodically, disrupting, the, orbits, of, comets, in, the, oort, cloud, leading, to, a, large, increase, in, the, number, of, comets, reaching, the, inner, solar, system, where, they, might, hit, earth, physicist, adrian, melott, and, paleontologist, richard, bambach, have, more, recently, verified, the, raup, and, sepkoski, finding, but, argue, that, it, is, not, consistent, with, the, characteristics, expected, of, a, nemesis, style, periodicity, an, impact, event, is, commonly, seen, as, a, scenario, that, would, bring, about, the, end, of, civilization, in, 2000, discover, magazine, published, a, list, of, 20, possible, sudden, doomsday, scenarios, with, an, impact, event, listed, as, the, most, likely, to, occur, a, joint, pew, research, center, smithsonian, survey, from, april, 21, to, 26, 2010, found, that, 31, percent, of, americans, believed, that, an, asteroid, will, collide, with, earth, by, 2050, a, majority, 61, percent, disagreed, in, the, early, history, of, the, earth, about, four, billion, years, ago, bolide, impacts, were, almost, certainly, common, since, the, solar, system, contained, far, more, discrete, bodies, than, at, present, such, impacts, could, have, included, strikes, by, asteroids, hundreds, of, kilometers, in, diameter, with, explosions, so, powerful, that, they, vaporized, all, the, earth, s, oceans, it, was, not, until, this, heavy, bombardment, slackened, that, life, appears, to, have, begun, to, evolve, on, earth, the, leading, theory, of, the, moon, s, origin, is, the, giant, impact, theory, which, postulates, that, earth, was, once, hit, by, a, planetoid, the, size, of, mars, such, a, theory, is, able, to, explain, the, size, and, composition, of, the, moon, something, not, done, by, other, theories, of, lunar, formation, according, to, the, theory, of, the, late, heavy, bombardment, there, should, have, been, 22, 000, or, more, impact, craters, with, diameters, 20, km, 12, mi, about, 40, impact, basins, with, diameters, about, 1, 000, km, 620, mi, and, several, impact, basins, with, diameters, about, 5, 000, km, 3, 100, mi, however, hundreds, of, millions, of, years, of, deformation, at, the, earth, s, crust, pose, significant, challenges, to, conclusively, identifying, impacts, from, this, period, only, two, pieces, of, pristine, lithosphere, are, believed, to, remain, from, this, era, kaapvaal, craton, in, contemporary, south, africa, and, pilbara, craton, in, contemporary, western, australia, to, search, within, which, may, potentially, reveal, evidence, in, the, form, of, physical, craters, other, methods, may, be, used, to, identify, impacts, from, this, period, for, example, indirect, gravitational, or, magnetic, analysis, of, the, mantle, but, may, prove, inconclusive, in, 2021, evidence, for, a, probable, impact, 3, 46, billion, years, ago, at, pilbara, craton, has, been, found, in, the, form, of, a, 150, kilometres, 93, mi, crater, created, by, the, impact, of, a, 10, kilometres, 6, 2, mi, asteroid, named, the, apex, asteroid, into, the, sea, at, a, depth, of, 2, 5, kilometres, 1, 6, mi, near, the, site, of, marble, bar, western, australia, the, event, caused, global, tsunamis, it, is, also, coincidental, to, some, of, the, earliest, evidence, of, life, on, earth, fossilized, stromatolites, evidence, of, a, massive, impact, named, s2, s, for, spherule, in, south, africa, near, a, geological, formation, known, as, the, barberton, greenstone, belt, was, uncovered, by, scientists, in, 2014, they, estimated, the, impact, occurred, at, kaapvaal, craton, south, africa, about, 3, 26, billion, years, ago, and, that, the, impactor, was, approximately, 37, 58, kilometers, 23, 36, miles, wide, the, crater, from, this, event, if, it, still, exists, has, not, yet, been, found, the, maniitsoq, structure, dated, to, around, 3, billion, years, old, 3, ga, was, once, thought, to, be, the, result, of, an, impact, however, follow, up, studies, have, not, confirmed, its, nature, as, an, impact, structure, the, maniitsoq, structure, is, not, recognised, as, an, impact, structure, by, the, earth, impact, database, in, 2020, scientists, discovered, the, world, s, oldest, confirmed, impact, crater, the, yarrabubba, crater, caused, by, an, impact, that, occurred, in, yilgarn, craton, what, is, now, western, australia, dated, at, more, than, 2, 2, billion, years, ago, with, the, impactor, estimated, to, be, around, 7, kilometres, 4, 3, mi, wide, it, is, believed, that, at, this, time, the, earth, was, mostly, or, completely, frozen, commonly, called, the, huronian, glaciation, the, vredefort, impact, event, which, occurred, around, 2, billion, years, ago, in, kaapvaal, craton, what, is, now, south, africa, caused, the, largest, verified, crater, a, multi, ringed, structure, 160, 300, km, 100, 200, mi, across, forming, from, an, impactor, approximately, 10, 15, km, 6, 2, 9, 3, mi, in, diameter, the, sudbury, impact, event, occurred, on, the, nuna, supercontinent, now, canada, from, a, bolide, approximately, 10, 15, km, 6, 2, 9, 3, mi, in, diameter, approximately, 1, 849, billion, years, ago, debris, from, the, event, would, have, been, scattered, across, the, globe, two, 10, kilometre, sized, asteroids, are, now, believed, to, have, struck, australia, between, 360, and, 300, million, years, ago, at, the, western, warburton, and, east, warburton, basins, creating, a, 400, kilometre, impact, zone, according, to, evidence, found, in, 2015, it, is, the, largest, ever, recorded, a, third, possible, impact, was, also, identified, in, 2015, to, the, north, on, the, upper, diamantina, river, also, believed, to, have, been, caused, by, an, asteroid, 10, km, across, about, 300, million, years, ago, but, further, studies, are, needed, to, establish, that, this, crustal, anomaly, was, indeed, the, result, of, an, impact, event, the, prehistoric, chicxulub, impact, 66, million, years, ago, believed, to, be, the, cause, of, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, was, caused, by, an, asteroid, estimated, to, be, about, 10, kilometres, 6, 2, mi, wide, analysis, of, the, hiawatha, glacier, reveals, the, presence, of, a, 31, km, wide, impact, crater, dated, at, 58, million, years, of, age, less, than, 10, million, years, after, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, scientists, believe, that, the, impactor, was, a, metallic, asteroid, with, a, diameter, in, the, order, of, 1, 5, kilometres, 0, 9, mi, the, impact, would, have, had, global, effects, artifacts, recovered, with, tektites, from, the, 803, 000, year, old, australasian, strewnfield, event, in, asia, link, a, homo, erectus, population, to, a, significant, meteorite, impact, and, its, aftermath, significant, examples, of, pleistocene, impacts, include, the, lonar, crater, lake, in, india, approximately, 52, 000, years, old, though, a, study, published, in, 2010, gives, a, much, greater, age, which, now, has, a, flourishing, semi, tropical, jungle, around, it, the, rio, cuarto, craters, in, argentina, were, produced, approximately, 10, 000, years, ago, at, the, beginning, of, the, holocene, if, proved, to, be, impact, craters, they, would, be, the, first, impact, of, the, holocene, the, campo, del, cielo, field, of, heaven, refers, to, an, area, bordering, argentina, s, chaco, province, where, a, group, of, iron, meteorites, were, found, estimated, as, dating, to, 4, 000, 5, 000, years, ago, it, first, came, to, attention, of, spanish, authorities, in, 1576, in, 2015, police, arrested, four, alleged, smugglers, trying, to, steal, more, than, a, ton, of, protected, meteorites, the, henbury, craters, in, australia, 5, 000, years, old, and, kaali, craters, in, estonia, 2, 700, years, old, were, apparently, produced, by, objects, that, broke, up, before, impact, whitecourt, crater, in, alberta, canada, is, estimated, to, be, between, 1, 080, and, 1, 130, years, old, the, crater, is, approximately, 36, m, 118, ft, in, diameter, and, 9, m, 30, ft, deep, is, heavily, forested, and, was, discovered, in, 2007, when, a, metal, detector, revealed, fragments, of, meteoric, iron, scattered, around, the, area, a, chinese, record, states, that, 10, 000, people, were, killed, in, the, 1490, qingyang, event, with, the, deaths, caused, by, a, hail, of, falling, stones, some, astronomers, hypothesize, that, this, may, describe, an, actual, meteorite, fall, although, they, find, the, number, of, deaths, implausible, kamil, crater, discovered, from, google, earth, image, review, in, egypt, 45, m, 148, ft, in, diameter, and, 10, m, 33, ft, deep, is, thought, to, have, been, formed, less, than, 3, 500, years, ago, in, a, then, unpopulated, region, of, western, egypt, it, was, found, february, 19, 2009, by, v, de, michelle, on, a, google, earth, image, of, the, east, uweinat, desert, egypt, one, of, the, best, known, recorded, impacts, in, modern, times, was, the, tunguska, event, which, occurred, in, siberia, russia, in, 1908, this, incident, involved, an, explosion, that, was, probably, caused, by, the, airburst, of, an, asteroid, or, comet, 5, to, 10, km, 3, 1, to, 6, 2, mi, above, the, earth, s, surface, felling, an, estimated, 80, million, trees, over, 2, 150, km, 2, 830, sq, mi, in, february, 1947, another, large, bolide, impacted, the, earth, in, the, sikhote, alin, mountains, primorye, soviet, union, it, was, during, daytime, hours, and, was, witnessed, by, many, people, which, allowed, v, g, fesenkov, then, chairman, of, the, meteorite, committee, of, the, ussr, academy, of, science, to, estimate, the, meteoroid, s, orbit, before, it, encountered, the, earth, sikhote, alin, is, a, massive, fall, with, the, overall, size, of, the, meteoroid, estimated, at, 90, 000, kg, 200, 000, lb, a, more, recent, estimate, by, tsvetkov, and, others, puts, the, mass, at, around, 100, 000, kg, 220, 000, lb, it, was, an, iron, meteorite, belonging, to, the, chemical, group, iiab, and, with, a, coarse, octahedrite, structure, more, than, 70, tonnes, metric, tons, of, material, survived, the, collision, a, case, of, a, human, injured, by, a, space, rock, occurred, on, november, 30, 1954, in, sylacauga, alabama, there, a, 4, kg, 8, 8, lb, stone, chondrite, crashed, through, a, roof, and, hit, ann, hodges, in, her, living, room, after, it, bounced, off, her, radio, she, was, badly, bruised, by, the, fragments, several, persons, have, since, claimed, to, have, been, struck, by, meteorites, but, no, verifiable, meteorites, have, resulted, a, small, number, of, meteorite, falls, have, been, observed, with, automated, cameras, and, recovered, following, calculation, of, the, impact, point, the, first, was, the, p, bram, meteorite, which, fell, in, czechoslovakia, now, the, czech, republic, in, 1959, in, this, case, two, cameras, used, to, photograph, meteors, captured, images, of, the, fireball, the, images, were, used, both, to, determine, the, location, of, the, stones, on, the, ground, and, more, significantly, to, calculate, for, the, first, time, an, accurate, orbit, for, a, recovered, meteorite, following, the, p, bram, fall, other, nations, established, automated, observing, programs, aimed, at, studying, infalling, meteorites, one, of, these, was, the, prairie, meteorite, network, operated, by, the, smithsonian, astrophysical, observatory, from, 1963, to, 1975, in, the, midwestern, u, s, this, program, also, observed, a, meteorite, fall, the, lost, city, chondrite, allowing, its, recovery, and, a, calculation, of, its, orbit, another, program, in, canada, the, meteorite, observation, and, recovery, project, ran, from, 1971, to, 1985, it, too, recovered, a, single, meteorite, innisfree, in, 1977, finally, observations, by, the, european, fireball, network, a, descendant, of, the, original, czech, program, that, recovered, p, bram, led, to, the, discovery, and, orbit, calculations, for, the, neuschwanstein, meteorite, in, 2002, on, august, 10, 1972, a, meteor, which, became, known, as, the, 1972, great, daylight, fireball, was, witnessed, by, many, people, as, it, moved, north, over, the, rocky, mountains, from, the, u, s, southwest, to, canada, it, was, filmed, by, a, tourist, at, the, grand, teton, national, park, in, wyoming, with, an, 8, millimeter, color, movie, camera, in, size, range, the, object, was, roughly, between, a, car, and, a, house, and, while, it, could, have, ended, its, life, in, a, hiroshima, sized, blast, there, was, never, any, explosion, analysis, of, the, trajectory, indicated, that, it, never, came, much, lower, than, 58, km, 36, mi, off, the, ground, and, the, conclusion, was, that, it, had, grazed, earth, s, atmosphere, for, about, 100, seconds, then, skipped, back, out, of, the, atmosphere, to, return, to, its, orbit, around, the, sun, many, impact, events, occur, without, being, observed, by, anyone, on, the, ground, between, 1975, and, 1992, american, missile, early, warning, satellites, picked, up, 136, major, explosions, in, the, upper, atmosphere, in, the, november, 21, 2002, edition, of, the, journal, nature, peter, brown, of, the, university, of, western, ontario, reported, on, his, study, of, u, s, early, warning, satellite, records, for, the, preceding, eight, years, he, identified, 300, flashes, caused, by, 1, to, 10, m, 3, to, 33, ft, meteors, in, that, time, period, and, estimated, the, rate, of, tunguska, sized, events, as, once, in, 400, years, eugene, shoemaker, estimated, that, an, event, of, such, magnitude, occurs, about, once, every, 300, years, though, more, recent, analyses, have, suggested, he, may, have, overestimated, by, an, order, of, magnitude, in, the, dark, morning, hours, of, january, 18, 2000, a, fireball, exploded, over, the, city, of, whitehorse, yukon, territory, at, an, altitude, of, about, 26, km, 16, mi, lighting, up, the, night, like, day, the, meteor, that, produced, the, fireball, was, estimated, to, be, about, 4, 6, m, 15, ft, in, diameter, with, a, weight, of, 180, tonnes, this, blast, was, also, featured, on, the, science, channel, series, killer, asteroids, with, several, witness, reports, from, residents, in, atlin, british, columbia, on, 7, june, 2006, a, meteor, was, observed, striking, a, location, in, the, reisadalen, valley, in, nordreisa, municipality, in, troms, county, norway, although, initial, witness, reports, stated, that, the, resultant, fireball, was, equivalent, to, the, hiroshima, nuclear, explosion, scientific, analysis, places, the, force, of, the, blast, at, anywhere, from, 100, to, 500, tonnes, tnt, equivalent, around, three, percent, of, hiroshima, s, yield, on, 15, september, 2007, a, chondritic, meteor, crashed, near, the, village, of, carancas, in, southeastern, peru, near, lake, titicaca, leaving, a, water, filled, hole, and, spewing, gases, across, the, surrounding, area, many, residents, became, ill, apparently, from, the, noxious, gases, shortly, after, the, impact, on, 7, october, 2008, an, approximately, 4, meter, asteroid, labeled, 2008, tc, 3, was, tracked, for, 20, hours, as, it, approached, earth, and, as, it, fell, through, the, atmosphere, and, impacted, in, sudan, this, was, the, first, time, an, object, was, detected, before, it, reached, the, atmosphere, and, hundreds, of, pieces, of, the, meteorite, were, recovered, from, the, nubian, desert, on, 15, february, 2013, an, asteroid, entered, earth, s, atmosphere, over, russia, as, a, fireball, and, exploded, above, the, city, of, chelyabinsk, during, its, passage, through, the, ural, mountains, region, at, 09, 13, yekt, 03, 13, utc, the, object, s, air, burst, occurred, at, an, altitude, between, 30, and, 50, km, 19, and, 31, mi, above, the, ground, and, about, 1, 500, people, were, injured, mainly, by, broken, window, glass, shattered, by, the, shock, wave, two, were, reported, in, serious, condition, however, there, were, no, fatalities, initially, some, 3, 000, buildings, in, six, cities, across, the, region, were, reported, damaged, due, to, the, explosion, s, shock, wave, a, figure, which, rose, to, over, 7, 200, in, the, following, weeks, the, chelyabinsk, meteor, was, estimated, to, have, caused, over, 30, million, in, damage, it, is, the, largest, recorded, object, to, have, encountered, the, earth, since, the, 1908, tunguska, event, the, meteor, is, estimated, to, have, an, initial, diameter, of, 17, 20, metres, and, a, mass, of, roughly, 10, 000, tonnes, on, 16, october, 2013, a, team, from, ural, federal, university, led, by, victor, grokhovsky, recovered, a, large, fragment, of, the, meteor, from, the, bottom, of, russia, s, lake, chebarkul, about, 80, km, west, of, the, city, on, 1, january, 2014, a, 3, meter, 10, foot, asteroid, 2014, aa, was, discovered, by, the, mount, lemmon, survey, and, observed, over, the, next, hour, and, was, soon, found, to, be, on, a, collision, course, with, earth, the, exact, location, was, uncertain, constrained, to, a, line, between, panama, the, central, atlantic, ocean, the, gambia, and, ethiopia, around, roughly, the, time, expected, 2, january, 3, 06, utc, an, infrasound, burst, was, detected, near, the, center, of, the, impact, range, in, the, middle, of, the, atlantic, ocean, this, marks, the, second, time, a, natural, object, was, identified, prior, to, impacting, earth, after, 2008, tc3, nearly, two, years, later, on, october, 3, wt1190f, was, detected, orbiting, earth, on, a, highly, eccentric, orbit, taking, it, from, well, within, the, geocentric, satellite, ring, to, nearly, twice, the, orbit, of, the, moon, it, was, estimated, to, be, perturbed, by, the, moon, onto, a, collision, course, with, earth, on, november, 13, with, over, a, month, of, observations, as, well, as, precovery, observations, found, dating, back, to, 2009, it, was, found, to, be, far, less, dense, than, a, natural, asteroid, should, be, suggesting, that, it, was, most, likely, an, unidentified, artificial, satellite, as, predicted, it, fell, over, sri, lanka, at, 6, 18, utc, 11, 48, local, time, the, sky, in, the, region, was, very, overcast, so, only, an, airborne, observation, team, was, able, to, successfully, observe, it, falling, above, the, clouds, it, is, now, thought, to, be, a, remnant, of, the, lunar, prospector, mission, in, 1998, and, is, the, third, time, any, previously, unknown, object, natural, or, artificial, was, identified, prior, to, impact, on, 22, january, 2018, an, object, a106fgf, was, discovered, by, the, asteroid, terrestrial, impact, last, alert, system, atlas, and, identified, as, having, a, small, chance, of, impacting, earth, later, that, day, as, it, was, very, dim, and, only, identified, hours, before, its, approach, no, more, than, the, initial, 4, observations, covering, a, 39, minute, period, were, made, of, the, object, it, is, unknown, if, it, impacted, earth, or, not, but, no, fireball, was, detected, in, either, infrared, or, infrasound, so, if, it, did, it, would, have, been, very, small, and, likely, near, the, eastern, end, of, its, potential, impact, area, in, the, western, pacific, ocean, on, 2, june, 2018, the, mount, lemmon, survey, detected, 2018, la, zlaf9b2, a, small, 2, 5, meter, asteroid, which, further, observations, soon, found, had, an, 85, chance, of, impacting, earth, soon, after, the, impact, a, fireball, report, from, botswana, arrived, to, the, american, meteor, society, further, observations, with, atlas, extended, the, observation, arc, from, 1, hour, to, 4, hours, and, confirmed, that, the, asteroid, orbit, indeed, impacted, earth, in, southern, africa, fully, closing, the, loop, with, the, fireball, report, and, making, this, the, third, natural, object, confirmed, to, impact, earth, and, the, second, on, land, after, 2008, tc, 3, on, 8, march, 2019, nasa, announced, the, detection, of, a, large, airburst, that, occurred, on, 18, december, 2018, at, 11, 48, local, time, off, the, eastern, coast, of, the, kamchatka, peninsula, the, kamchatka, superbolide, is, estimated, to, have, had, a, mass, of, roughly, 1600, tons, and, a, diameter, of, 9, to, 14, meters, depending, on, its, density, making, it, the, third, largest, asteroid, to, impact, earth, since, 1900, after, the, chelyabinsk, meteor, and, the, tunguska, event, the, fireball, exploded, in, an, airburst, 25, 6, kilometres, 15, 9, mi, above, earth, s, surface, 2019, mo, an, approximately, 4m, asteroid, was, detected, by, atlas, a, few, hours, before, it, impacted, the, caribbean, sea, near, puerto, rico, in, june, 2019, in, 2023, a, small, meteorite, is, believed, to, have, crashed, through, the, roof, of, a, home, in, trenton, new, jersey, the, metallic, rock, was, approximately, 4, inches, by, 6, inches, and, weighed, 4, pounds, the, item, was, seized, by, police, and, tested, for, radioactivity, the, object, was, later, confirmed, to, be, a, meteorite, by, scientists, at, the, college, of, new, jersey, as, well, as, meteorite, expert, jerry, delaney, who, previously, worked, at, rutgers, university, and, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, in, the, late, 20th, and, early, 21st, century, scientists, put, in, place, measures, to, detect, near, earth, objects, and, predict, the, dates, and, times, of, asteroids, impacting, earth, along, with, the, locations, at, which, they, will, impact, the, international, astronomical, union, minor, planet, center, mpc, is, the, global, clearing, house, for, information, on, asteroid, orbits, nasa, s, sentry, system, continually, scans, the, mpc, catalog, of, known, asteroids, analyzing, their, orbits, for, any, possible, future, impacts, currently, none, are, predicted, the, single, highest, probability, impact, currently, listed, is, 7, m, asteroid, 2010, rf, 12, which, is, due, to, pass, earth, in, september, 2095, with, only, a, 5, predicted, chance, of, impacting, currently, prediction, is, mainly, based, on, cataloging, asteroids, years, before, they, are, due, to, impact, this, works, well, for, larger, asteroids, 1, km, across, as, they, are, easily, seen, from, a, long, distance, over, 95, of, them, are, already, known, and, their, orbits, have, been, measured, so, any, future, impacts, can, be, predicted, long, before, they, are, on, their, final, approach, to, earth, smaller, objects, are, too, faint, to, observe, except, when, they, come, very, close, and, so, most, cannot, be, observed, before, their, final, approach, current, mechanisms, for, detecting, asteroids, on, final, approach, rely, on, wide, field, ground, based, telescopes, such, as, the, atlas, system, however, current, telescopes, only, cover, part, of, the, earth, and, even, more, importantly, cannot, detect, asteroids, on, the, day, side, of, the, planet, which, is, why, so, few, of, the, smaller, asteroids, that, commonly, impact, earth, are, detected, during, the, few, hours, that, they, would, be, visible, so, far, only, four, impact, events, have, been, successfully, predicted, all, from, innocuous, 2, 5, m, diameter, asteroids, and, detected, a, few, hours, in, advance, in, april, 2018, the, b612, foundation, reported, it, s, 100, per, cent, certain, we, ll, be, hit, but, we, re, not, 100, per, cent, certain, when, also, in, 2018, physicist, stephen, hawking, in, his, final, book, brief, answers, to, the, big, questions, considered, an, asteroid, collision, to, be, the, biggest, threat, to, the, planet, in, june, 2018, the, us, national, science, and, technology, council, warned, that, america, is, unprepared, for, an, asteroid, impact, event, and, has, developed, and, released, the, national, near, earth, object, preparedness, strategy, action, plan, to, better, prepare, according, to, expert, testimony, in, the, united, states, congress, in, 2013, nasa, would, require, at, least, five, years, of, preparation, to, launch, a, mission, to, intercept, an, asteroid, the, preferred, method, is, to, deflect, rather, than, disrupt, an, asteroid, impact, craters, provide, evidence, of, past, impacts, on, other, planets, in, the, solar, system, including, possible, interplanetary, terrestrial, impacts, without, carbon, dating, other, points, of, reference, are, used, to, estimate, the, timing, of, these, impact, events, mars, provides, some, significant, evidence, of, possible, interplanetary, collisions, the, north, polar, basin, on, mars, is, speculated, by, some, to, be, evidence, for, a, planet, sized, impact, on, the, surface, of, mars, between, 3, 8, and, 3, 9, billion, years, ago, while, utopia, planitia, is, the, largest, confirmed, impact, and, hellas, planitia, is, the, largest, visible, crater, in, the, solar, system, the, moon, provides, similar, evidence, of, massive, impacts, with, the, south, pole, aitken, basin, being, the, biggest, mercury, s, caloris, basin, is, another, example, of, a, crater, formed, by, a, massive, impact, event, rheasilvia, on, vesta, is, an, example, of, a, crater, formed, by, an, impact, capable, of, based, on, ratio, of, impact, to, size, severely, deforming, a, planetary, mass, object, impact, craters, on, the, moons, of, saturn, such, as, engelier, and, gerin, on, iapetus, mamaldi, on, rhea, and, odysseus, on, tethys, and, herschel, on, mimas, form, significant, surface, features, models, developed, in, 2018, to, explain, the, unusual, spin, of, uranus, support, a, long, held, hypothesis, that, this, was, caused, by, an, oblique, collision, with, a, massive, object, twice, the, size, of, earth, jupiter, is, the, most, massive, planet, in, the, solar, system, and, because, of, its, large, mass, it, has, a, vast, sphere, of, gravitational, influence, the, region, of, space, where, an, asteroid, capture, can, take, place, under, favorable, conditions, jupiter, is, able, to, capture, comets, in, orbit, around, the, sun, with, a, certain, frequency, in, general, these, comets, travel, some, revolutions, around, the, planet, following, unstable, orbits, as, highly, elliptical, and, perturbable, by, solar, gravity, while, some, of, them, eventually, recover, a, heliocentric, orbit, others, crash, on, the, planet, or, more, rarely, on, its, satellites, in, addition, to, the, mass, factor, its, relative, proximity, to, the, inner, solar, system, allows, jupiter, to, influence, the, distribution, of, minor, bodies, there, for, a, long, time, it, was, believed, that, these, characteristics, led, the, gas, giant, to, expel, from, the, system, or, to, attract, most, of, the, wandering, objects, in, its, vicinity, and, consequently, to, determine, a, reduction, in, the, number, of, potentially, dangerous, objects, for, the, earth, subsequent, dynamic, studies, have, shown, that, in, reality, the, situation, is, more, complex, the, presence, of, jupiter, in, fact, tends, to, reduce, the, frequency, of, impact, on, the, earth, of, objects, coming, from, the, oort, cloud, while, it, increases, it, in, the, case, of, asteroids, and, short, period, comets, for, this, reason, jupiter, is, the, planet, of, the, solar, system, characterized, by, the, highest, frequency, of, impacts, which, justifies, its, reputation, as, the, sweeper, or, cosmic, vacuum, cleaner, of, the, solar, system, 2009, studies, suggest, an, impact, frequency, of, one, every, 50, 350, years, for, an, object, of, 0, 5, 1, km, in, diameter, impacts, with, smaller, objects, would, occur, more, frequently, another, study, estimated, that, comets, 0, 3, km, 0, 19, mi, in, diameter, impact, the, planet, once, in, approximately, 500, years, and, those, 1, 6, km, 0, 99, mi, in, diameter, do, so, just, once, in, every, 6, 000, years, in, july, 1994, comet, shoemaker, levy, 9, was, a, comet, that, broke, apart, and, collided, with, jupiter, providing, the, first, direct, observation, of, an, extraterrestrial, collision, of, solar, system, objects, the, event, served, as, a, wake, up, call, and, astronomers, responded, by, starting, programs, such, as, lincoln, near, earth, asteroid, research, linear, near, earth, asteroid, tracking, neat, lowell, observatory, near, earth, object, search, loneos, and, several, others, which, have, drastically, increased, the, rate, of, asteroid, discovery, the, 2009, impact, event, happened, on, july, 19, when, a, new, black, spot, about, the, size, of, earth, was, discovered, in, jupiter, s, southern, hemisphere, by, amateur, astronomer, anthony, wesley, thermal, infrared, analysis, showed, it, was, warm, and, spectroscopic, methods, detected, ammonia, jpl, scientists, confirmed, that, there, was, another, impact, event, on, jupiter, probably, involving, a, small, undiscovered, comet, or, other, icy, body, the, impactor, is, estimated, to, have, been, about, 200, 500, meters, in, diameter, later, minor, impacts, were, observed, by, amateur, astronomers, in, 2010, 2012, 2016, and, 2017, one, impact, was, observed, by, juno, in, 2020, in, 1998, two, comets, were, observed, plunging, toward, the, sun, in, close, succession, the, first, of, these, was, on, june, 1, and, the, second, the, next, day, a, video, of, this, followed, by, a, dramatic, ejection, of, solar, gas, unrelated, to, the, impacts, can, be, found, at, the, nasa, website, both, of, these, comets, evaporated, before, coming, into, contact, with, the, surface, of, the, sun, according, to, a, theory, by, nasa, jet, propulsion, laboratory, scientist, zden, k, sekanina, the, latest, impactor, to, actually, make, contact, with, the, sun, was, the, supercomet, howard, koomen, michels, on, august, 30, 1979, see, also, sungrazer, in, 2010, between, january, and, may, hubble, s, wide, field, camera, 3, took, images, of, an, unusual, x, shape, originated, in, the, aftermath, of, the, collision, between, asteroid, p, 2010, a2, with, a, smaller, asteroid, around, march, 27, 2012, based, on, evidence, there, were, signs, of, an, impact, on, mars, images, from, the, mars, reconnaissance, orbiter, provide, compelling, evidence, of, the, largest, impact, observed, to, date, on, mars, in, the, form, of, fresh, craters, the, largest, measuring, 48, 5, by, 43, 5, meters, it, is, estimated, to, be, caused, by, an, impactor, 3, to, 5, meters, long, on, march, 19, 2013, an, impact, occurred, on, the, moon, that, was, visible, from, earth, when, a, boulder, sized, 30, cm, meteoroid, slammed, into, the, lunar, surface, at, 90, 000, km, h, 25, km, s, 56, 000, mph, creating, a, 20, meter, crater, nasa, has, actively, monitored, lunar, impacts, since, 2005, tracking, hundreds, of, candidate, events, on, 18, september, 2021, an, impact, event, on, mars, formed, a, cluster, of, craters, the, largest, being, 130m, in, diameter, on, 24, december, 2021, an, impact, created, a, 150m, wide, crater, debris, was, ejected, up, to, 35, km, 19, miles, from, the, impact, site, collisions, between, galaxies, or, galaxy, mergers, have, been, observed, directly, by, space, telescopes, such, as, hubble, and, spitzer, however, collisions, in, planetary, systems, including, stellar, collisions, while, long, speculated, have, only, recently, begun, to, be, observed, directly, in, 2013, an, impact, between, minor, planets, was, detected, around, the, star, ngc, 2547, id, 8, by, spitzer, and, confirmed, by, ground, observations, computer, modelling, suggests, that, the, impact, involved, large, asteroids, or, protoplanets, similar, to, the, events, believed, to, have, led, to, the, formation, of, terrestrial, planets, like, the, earth, pdf, direct, link,
