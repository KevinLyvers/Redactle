the, pinwheel, galaxy, also, known, as, messier, 101, m101, or, ngc, 5457, is, a, face, on, unbarred, and, counterclockwise, spiral, galaxy, located, 21, million, light, years, 6, 4, megaparsecs, from, earth, in, the, constellation, ursa, major, it, was, discovered, by, pierre, m, chain, in, 1781, and, was, communicated, that, year, to, charles, messier, who, verified, its, position, for, inclusion, in, the, messier, catalogue, as, one, of, its, final, entries, on, february, 28, 2006, nasa, and, the, european, space, agency, released, a, very, detailed, image, of, the, pinwheel, galaxy, which, was, the, largest, and, most, detailed, image, of, a, galaxy, by, hubble, space, telescope, at, the, time, the, image, was, composed, of, 51, individual, exposures, plus, some, extra, ground, based, photos, pierre, m, chain, the, discoverer, of, the, galaxy, described, it, as, a, nebula, without, star, very, obscure, and, pretty, large, 6, to, 7, in, diameter, between, the, left, hand, of, bootes, and, the, tail, of, the, great, bear, it, is, difficult, to, distinguish, when, one, lits, the, wires, william, herschel, wrote, in, 1784, that, the, galaxy, was, one, of, several, which, in, my, 7, 10, and, 20, feet, reflectors, shewed, a, mottled, kind, of, nebulosity, which, i, shall, call, resolvable, so, that, i, expect, my, present, telescope, will, perhaps, render, the, stars, visible, of, which, i, suppose, them, to, be, composed, lord, rosse, observed, the, galaxy, in, his, 72, inch, diameter, newtonian, reflector, during, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, he, was, the, first, to, make, extensive, note, of, the, spiral, structure, and, made, several, sketches, though, the, galaxy, can, be, detected, with, binoculars, or, a, small, telescope, to, observe, the, spiral, structure, in, a, telescope, without, a, camera, requires, a, fairly, large, instrument, very, dark, skies, and, a, low, power, eyepiece, m101, is, a, large, galaxy, with, a, diameter, of, 170, 000, light, years, by, comparison, the, milky, way, has, a, diameter, of, 87, 400, light, years, it, has, around, a, trillion, stars, it, has, a, disk, mass, on, the, order, of, 100, billion, solar, masses, along, with, a, small, central, bulge, of, about, 3, billion, solar, masses, its, characteristics, can, be, compared, to, those, of, andromeda, galaxy, m101, has, a, high, population, of, h, ii, regions, many, of, which, are, very, large, and, bright, h, ii, regions, usually, accompany, the, enormous, clouds, of, high, density, molecular, hydrogen, gas, contracting, under, their, own, gravitational, force, where, stars, form, h, ii, regions, are, ionized, by, large, numbers, of, extremely, bright, and, hot, young, stars, those, in, m101, are, capable, of, creating, hot, superbubbles, in, a, 1990, study, 1, 264, h, ii, regions, were, cataloged, in, the, galaxy, three, are, prominent, enough, to, receive, new, general, catalogue, numbers, ngc, 5461, ngc, 5462, and, ngc, 5471, m101, is, asymmetrical, due, to, the, tidal, forces, from, interactions, with, its, companion, galaxies, these, gravitational, interactions, compress, interstellar, hydrogen, gas, which, then, triggers, strong, star, formation, activity, in, m101, s, spiral, arms, that, can, be, detected, in, ultraviolet, images, in, 2001, the, x, ray, source, p98, located, in, m101, was, identified, as, an, ultra, luminous, x, ray, source, a, source, more, powerful, than, any, single, star, but, less, powerful, than, a, whole, galaxy, using, the, chandra, x, ray, observatory, it, received, the, designation, m101, ulx, 1, in, 2005, hubble, and, xmm, newton, observations, showed, the, presence, of, an, optical, counterpart, strongly, indicating, that, m101, ulx, 1, is, an, x, ray, binary, further, observations, showed, that, the, system, deviated, from, expected, models, the, black, hole, is, just, 20, to, 30, solar, masses, and, consumes, material, including, captured, stellar, wind, at, a, higher, rate, than, theory, suggests, it, is, estimated, that, m101, has, about, 150, globular, clusters, the, same, as, the, number, of, the, milky, way, s, globular, clusters, m101, has, six, prominent, companion, galaxies, ngc, 5204, ngc, 5474, ngc, 5477, ngc, 5585, ugc, 8837, and, ugc, 9405, as, stated, above, the, gravitational, interaction, between, it, and, its, satellites, may, have, spawned, its, grand, design, pattern, the, galaxy, has, probably, distorted, the, second, listed, companion, the, list, comprises, most, or, all, of, the, m101, group, six, internal, supernovae, have, been, recorded
