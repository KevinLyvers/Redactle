potassium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, k, from, neo, latin, kalium, and, atomic, number, 19, it, is, a, silvery, white, metal, that, is, soft, enough, to, easily, cut, with, a, knife, potassium, metal, reacts, rapidly, with, atmospheric, oxygen, to, form, flaky, white, potassium, peroxide, in, only, seconds, of, exposure, it, was, first, isolated, from, potash, the, ashes, of, plants, from, which, its, name, derives, in, the, periodic, table, potassium, is, one, of, the, alkali, metals, all, of, which, have, a, single, valence, electron, in, the, outer, electron, shell, which, is, easily, removed, to, create, an, ion, with, a, positive, charge, which, combines, with, anions, to, form, salts, in, nature, potassium, occurs, only, in, ionic, salts, elemental, potassium, reacts, vigorously, with, water, generating, sufficient, heat, to, ignite, hydrogen, emitted, in, the, reaction, and, burning, with, a, lilac, colored, flame, it, is, found, dissolved, in, seawater, which, is, 0, 04, potassium, by, weight, and, occurs, in, many, minerals, such, as, orthoclase, a, common, constituent, of, granites, and, other, igneous, rocks, potassium, is, chemically, very, similar, to, sodium, the, previous, element, in, group, 1, of, the, periodic, table, they, have, a, similar, first, ionization, energy, which, allows, for, each, atom, to, give, up, its, sole, outer, electron, it, was, first, suggested, in, 1702, that, they, were, distinct, elements, that, combine, with, the, same, anions, to, make, similar, salts, which, was, demonstrated, in, 1807, when, elemental, potassium, was, first, isolated, via, electrolysis, naturally, occurring, potassium, is, composed, of, three, isotopes, of, which, 40, k, is, radioactive, traces, of, 40, k, are, found, in, all, potassium, and, it, is, the, most, common, radioisotope, in, the, human, body, potassium, ions, are, vital, for, the, functioning, of, all, living, cells, the, transfer, of, potassium, ions, across, nerve, cell, membranes, is, necessary, for, normal, nerve, transmission, potassium, deficiency, and, excess, can, each, result, in, numerous, signs, and, symptoms, including, an, abnormal, heart, rhythm, and, various, electrocardiographic, abnormalities, fresh, fruits, and, vegetables, are, good, dietary, sources, of, potassium, the, body, responds, to, the, influx, of, dietary, potassium, which, raises, serum, potassium, levels, by, shifting, potassium, from, outside, to, inside, cells, and, increasing, potassium, excretion, by, the, kidneys, most, industrial, applications, of, potassium, exploit, the, high, solubility, of, its, compounds, in, water, such, as, saltwater, soap, heavy, crop, production, rapidly, depletes, the, soil, of, potassium, and, this, can, be, remedied, with, agricultural, fertilizers, containing, potassium, accounting, for, 95, of, global, potassium, chemical, production, the, english, name, for, the, element, potassium, comes, from, the, word, potash, which, refers, to, an, early, method, of, extracting, various, potassium, salts, placing, in, a, pot, the, ash, of, burnt, wood, or, tree, leaves, adding, water, heating, and, evaporating, the, solution, when, humphry, davy, first, isolated, the, pure, element, using, electrolysis, in, 1807, he, named, it, potassium, which, he, derived, from, the, word, potash, the, symbol, k, stems, from, kali, itself, from, the, root, word, alkali, which, in, turn, comes, from, arabic, al, qalyah, plant, ashes, in, 1797, the, german, chemist, martin, klaproth, discovered, potash, in, the, minerals, leucite, and, lepidolite, and, realized, that, potash, was, not, a, product, of, plant, growth, but, actually, contained, a, new, element, which, he, proposed, calling, kali, in, 1807, humphry, davy, produced, the, element, via, electrolysis, in, 1809, ludwig, wilhelm, gilbert, proposed, the, name, kalium, for, davy, s, potassium, in, 1814, the, swedish, chemist, berzelius, advocated, the, name, kalium, for, potassium, with, the, chemical, symbol, k, the, english, and, french, speaking, countries, adopted, the, name, potassium, which, was, favored, by, davy, and, french, chemists, joseph, louis, gay, lussac, and, louis, jacques, th, nard, whereas, the, other, germanic, countries, adopted, gilbert, and, klaproth, s, name, kalium, the, gold, book, of, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, has, designated, the, official, chemical, symbol, as, k, potassium, is, the, second, least, dense, metal, after, lithium, it, is, a, soft, solid, with, a, low, melting, point, and, can, be, easily, cut, with, a, knife, potassium, is, silvery, in, appearance, but, it, begins, to, tarnish, toward, gray, immediately, on, exposure, to, air, in, a, flame, test, potassium, and, its, compounds, emit, a, lilac, color, with, a, peak, emission, wavelength, of, 766, 5, nanometers, neutral, potassium, atoms, have, 19, electrons, one, more, than, the, configuration, of, the, noble, gas, argon, because, of, its, low, first, ionization, energy, of, 418, 8, kj, mol, the, potassium, atom, is, much, more, likely, to, lose, the, last, electron, and, acquire, a, positive, charge, although, negatively, charged, alkalide, k, ions, are, not, impossible, in, contrast, the, second, ionization, energy, is, very, high, 3052, kj, mol, potassium, reacts, with, oxygen, water, and, carbon, dioxide, components, in, air, with, oxygen, it, forms, potassium, peroxide, with, water, potassium, forms, potassium, hydroxide, koh, the, reaction, of, potassium, with, water, can, be, violently, exothermic, especially, since, the, coproduced, hydrogen, gas, can, ignite, because, of, this, potassium, and, the, liquid, sodium, potassium, nak, alloy, are, potent, desiccants, although, they, are, no, longer, used, as, such, four, oxides, of, potassium, are, well, studied, potassium, oxide, k, 2, o, potassium, peroxide, k, 2, o, 2, potassium, superoxide, ko, 2, and, potassium, ozonide, ko, 3, the, binary, potassium, oxygen, compounds, react, with, water, forming, koh, koh, is, a, strong, base, illustrating, its, hydrophilic, character, as, much, as, 1, 21, kg, of, koh, can, dissolve, in, a, single, liter, of, water, anhydrous, koh, is, rarely, encountered, koh, reacts, readily, with, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, to, produce, potassium, carbonate, k, 2, co, 3, and, in, principle, could, be, used, to, remove, traces, of, the, gas, from, air, like, the, closely, related, sodium, hydroxide, koh, reacts, with, fats, to, produce, soaps, in, general, potassium, compounds, are, ionic, and, owing, to, the, high, hydration, energy, of, the, k, ion, have, excellent, water, solubility, the, main, species, in, water, solution, are, the, aquo, complexes, where, n, 6, and, 7, potassium, heptafluorotantalate, k, 2, is, an, intermediate, in, the, purification, of, tantalum, from, the, otherwise, persistent, contaminant, of, niobium, organopotassium, compounds, illustrate, nonionic, compounds, of, potassium, they, feature, highly, polar, covalent, k, c, bonds, examples, include, benzyl, potassium, kch, 2, c, 6, h, 5, potassium, intercalates, into, graphite, to, give, a, variety, of, graphite, intercalation, compounds, including, kc, 8, there, are, 25, known, isotopes, of, potassium, three, of, which, occur, naturally, 39, k, 93, 3, 40, k, 0, 0117, and, 41, k, 6, 7, by, mole, fraction, naturally, occurring, 40, k, has, a, half, life, of, 1, 250, 10, 9, years, it, decays, to, stable, 40, ar, by, electron, capture, or, positron, emission, 11, 2, or, to, stable, 40, ca, by, beta, decay, 88, 8, the, decay, of, 40, k, to, 40, ar, is, the, basis, of, a, common, method, for, dating, rocks, the, conventional, k, ar, dating, method, depends, on, the, assumption, that, the, rocks, contained, no, argon, at, the, time, of, formation, and, that, all, the, subsequent, radiogenic, argon, 40, ar, was, quantitatively, retained, minerals, are, dated, by, measurement, of, the, concentration, of, potassium, and, the, amount, of, radiogenic, 40, ar, that, has, accumulated, the, minerals, best, suited, for, dating, include, biotite, muscovite, metamorphic, hornblende, and, volcanic, feldspar, whole, rock, samples, from, volcanic, flows, and, shallow, instrusives, can, also, be, dated, if, they, are, unaltered, apart, from, dating, potassium, isotopes, have, been, used, as, tracers, in, studies, of, weathering, and, for, nutrient, cycling, studies, because, potassium, is, a, macronutrient, required, for, life, on, earth, 40, k, occurs, in, natural, potassium, and, thus, in, some, commercial, salt, substitutes, in, sufficient, quantity, that, large, bags, of, those, substitutes, can, be, used, as, a, radioactive, source, for, classroom, demonstrations, 40, k, is, the, radioisotope, with, the, largest, abundance, in, the, human, body, in, healthy, animals, and, people, 40, k, represents, the, largest, source, of, radioactivity, greater, even, than, 14, c, in, a, human, body, of, 70, kg, about, 4, 400, nuclei, of, 40, k, decay, per, second, the, activity, of, natural, potassium, is, 31, bq, g, potash, is, primarily, a, mixture, of, potassium, salts, because, plants, have, little, or, no, sodium, content, and, the, rest, of, a, plant, s, major, mineral, content, consists, of, calcium, salts, of, relatively, low, solubility, in, water, while, potash, has, been, used, since, ancient, times, its, composition, was, not, understood, georg, ernst, stahl, obtained, experimental, evidence, that, led, him, to, suggest, the, fundamental, difference, of, sodium, and, potassium, salts, in, 1702, and, henri, louis, duhamel, du, monceau, was, able, to, prove, this, difference, in, 1736, the, exact, chemical, composition, of, potassium, and, sodium, compounds, and, the, status, as, chemical, element, of, potassium, and, sodium, was, not, known, then, and, thus, antoine, lavoisier, did, not, include, the, alkali, in, his, list, of, chemical, elements, in, 1789, for, a, long, time, the, only, significant, applications, for, potash, were, the, production, of, glass, bleach, soap, and, gunpowder, as, potassium, nitrate, potassium, soaps, from, animal, fats, and, vegetable, oils, were, especially, prized, because, they, tend, to, be, more, water, soluble, and, of, softer, texture, and, are, therefore, known, as, soft, soaps, the, discovery, by, justus, liebig, in, 1840, that, potassium, is, a, necessary, element, for, plants, and, that, most, types, of, soil, lack, potassium, caused, a, steep, rise, in, demand, for, potassium, salts, wood, ash, from, fir, trees, was, initially, used, as, a, potassium, salt, source, for, fertilizer, but, with, the, discovery, in, 1868, of, mineral, deposits, containing, potassium, chloride, near, sta, furt, germany, the, production, of, potassium, containing, fertilizers, began, at, an, industrial, scale, other, potash, deposits, were, discovered, and, by, the, 1960s, canada, became, the, dominant, producer, potassium, metal, was, first, isolated, in, 1807, by, humphry, davy, who, derived, it, by, electrolysis, of, molten, caustic, potash, koh, with, the, newly, discovered, voltaic, pile, potassium, was, the, first, metal, that, was, isolated, by, electrolysis, later, in, the, same, year, davy, reported, extraction, of, the, metal, sodium, from, a, mineral, derivative, caustic, soda, naoh, or, lye, rather, than, a, plant, salt, by, a, similar, technique, demonstrating, that, the, elements, and, thus, the, salts, are, different, although, the, production, of, potassium, and, sodium, metal, should, have, shown, that, both, are, elements, it, took, some, time, before, this, view, was, universally, accepted, because, of, the, sensitivity, of, potassium, to, water, and, air, air, free, techniques, are, normally, employed, for, handling, the, element, it, is, unreactive, toward, nitrogen, and, saturated, hydrocarbons, such, as, mineral, oil, or, kerosene, it, readily, dissolves, in, liquid, ammonia, up, to, 480, g, per, 1000, g, of, ammonia, at, 0, c, depending, on, the, concentration, the, ammonia, solutions, are, blue, to, yellow, and, their, electrical, conductivity, is, similar, to, that, of, liquid, metals, potassium, slowly, reacts, with, ammonia, to, form, knh, 2, but, this, reaction, is, accelerated, by, minute, amounts, of, transition, metal, salts, because, it, can, reduce, the, salts, to, the, metal, potassium, is, often, used, as, the, reductant, in, the, preparation, of, finely, divided, metals, from, their, salts, by, the, rieke, method, illustrative, is, the, preparation, of, magnesium, potassium, is, formed, in, supernovae, by, nucleosynthesis, from, lighter, atoms, potassium, is, principally, created, in, type, ii, supernovae, via, an, explosive, oxygen, burning, process, these, are, nuclear, fusion, reactions, not, to, be, confused, with, chemical, burning, of, potassium, in, oxygen, 40, k, is, also, formed, in, s, process, nucleosynthesis, and, the, neon, burning, process, potassium, is, the, 20th, most, abundant, element, in, the, solar, system, and, the, 17th, most, abundant, element, by, weight, in, the, earth, it, makes, up, about, 2, 6, of, the, weight, of, the, earth, s, crust, and, is, the, seventh, most, abundant, element, in, the, crust, the, potassium, concentration, in, seawater, is, 0, 39, g, l, 0, 039, wt, v, about, one, twenty, seventh, the, concentration, of, sodium, elemental, potassium, does, not, occur, in, nature, because, of, its, high, reactivity, it, reacts, violently, with, water, and, also, reacts, with, oxygen, orthoclase, potassium, feldspar, is, a, common, rock, forming, mineral, granite, for, example, contains, 5, potassium, which, is, well, above, the, average, in, the, earth, s, crust, sylvite, kcl, carnallite, kcl, mgcl, 2, 6h, 2, o, kainite, mgso, 4, kcl, 3h, 2, o, and, langbeinite, mgso, 4, k, 2, so, 4, are, the, minerals, found, in, large, evaporite, deposits, worldwide, the, deposits, often, show, layers, starting, with, the, least, soluble, at, the, bottom, and, the, most, soluble, on, top, deposits, of, niter, potassium, nitrate, are, formed, by, decomposition, of, organic, material, in, contact, with, atmosphere, mostly, in, caves, because, of, the, good, water, solubility, of, niter, the, formation, of, larger, deposits, requires, special, environmental, conditions, potassium, salts, such, as, carnallite, langbeinite, polyhalite, and, sylvite, form, extensive, evaporite, deposits, in, ancient, lake, bottoms, and, seabeds, making, extraction, of, potassium, salts, in, these, environments, commercially, viable, the, principal, source, of, potassium, potash, is, mined, in, canada, russia, belarus, kazakhstan, germany, israel, the, u, s, jordan, and, other, places, around, the, world, the, first, mined, deposits, were, located, near, sta, furt, germany, but, the, deposits, span, from, great, britain, over, germany, into, poland, they, are, located, in, the, zechstein, and, were, deposited, in, the, middle, to, late, permian, the, largest, deposits, ever, found, lie, 1, 000, meters, 3, 300, feet, below, the, surface, of, the, canadian, province, of, saskatchewan, the, deposits, are, located, in, the, elk, point, group, produced, in, the, middle, devonian, saskatchewan, where, several, large, mines, have, operated, since, the, 1960s, pioneered, the, technique, of, freezing, of, wet, sands, the, blairmore, formation, to, drive, mine, shafts, through, them, the, main, potash, mining, company, in, saskatchewan, until, its, merge, was, the, potash, corporation, of, saskatchewan, now, nutrien, the, water, of, the, dead, sea, is, used, by, israel, and, jordan, as, a, source, of, potash, while, the, concentration, in, normal, oceans, is, too, low, for, commercial, production, at, current, prices, several, methods, are, used, to, separate, potassium, salts, from, sodium, and, magnesium, compounds, the, most, used, method, is, fractional, precipitation, using, the, solubility, differences, of, the, salts, electrostatic, separation, of, the, ground, salt, mixture, is, also, used, in, some, mines, the, resulting, sodium, and, magnesium, waste, is, either, stored, underground, or, piled, up, in, slag, heaps, most, of, the, mined, potassium, mineral, ends, up, as, potassium, chloride, after, processing, the, mineral, industry, refers, to, potassium, chloride, either, as, potash, muriate, of, potash, or, simply, mop, pure, potassium, metal, can, be, isolated, by, electrolysis, of, its, hydroxide, in, a, process, that, has, changed, little, since, it, was, first, used, by, humphry, davy, in, 1807, although, the, electrolysis, process, was, developed, and, used, in, industrial, scale, in, the, 1920s, the, thermal, method, by, reacting, sodium, with, potassium, chloride, in, a, chemical, equilibrium, reaction, became, the, dominant, method, in, the, 1950s, the, production, of, sodium, potassium, alloys, is, accomplished, by, changing, the, reaction, time, and, the, amount, of, sodium, used, in, the, reaction, the, griesheimer, process, employing, the, reaction, of, potassium, fluoride, with, calcium, carbide, was, also, used, to, produce, potassium, reagent, grade, potassium, metal, costs, about, 10, 00, pound, 22, kg, in, 2010, when, purchased, by, the, tonne, lower, purity, metal, is, considerably, cheaper, the, market, is, volatile, because, long, term, storage, of, the, metal, is, difficult, it, must, be, stored, in, a, dry, inert, gas, atmosphere, or, anhydrous, mineral, oil, to, prevent, the, formation, of, a, surface, layer, of, potassium, superoxide, a, pressure, sensitive, explosive, that, detonates, when, scratched, the, resulting, explosion, often, starts, a, fire, difficult, to, extinguish, potassium, is, now, quantified, by, ionization, techniques, but, at, one, time, it, was, quantitated, by, gravimetric, analysis, reagents, used, to, precipitate, potassium, salts, include, sodium, tetraphenylborate, hexachloroplatinic, acid, and, sodium, cobaltinitrite, into, respectively, potassium, tetraphenylborate, potassium, hexachloroplatinate, and, potassium, cobaltinitrite, the, reaction, with, sodium, cobaltinitrite, is, illustrative, the, potassium, cobaltinitrite, is, obtained, as, a, yellow, solid, potassium, ions, are, an, essential, component, of, plant, nutrition, and, are, found, in, most, soil, types, they, are, used, as, a, fertilizer, in, agriculture, horticulture, and, hydroponic, culture, in, the, form, of, chloride, kcl, sulfate, k, 2, so, 4, or, nitrate, kno, 3, representing, the, k, in, npk, agricultural, fertilizers, consume, 95, of, global, potassium, chemical, production, and, about, 90, of, this, potassium, is, supplied, as, kcl, the, potassium, content, of, most, plants, ranges, from, 0, 5, to, 2, of, the, harvested, weight, of, crops, conventionally, expressed, as, amount, of, k, 2, o, modern, high, yield, agriculture, depends, upon, fertilizers, to, replace, the, potassium, lost, at, harvest, most, agricultural, fertilizers, contain, potassium, chloride, while, potassium, sulfate, is, used, for, chloride, sensitive, crops, or, crops, needing, higher, sulfur, content, the, sulfate, is, produced, mostly, by, decomposition, of, the, complex, minerals, kainite, mgso, 4, kcl, 3h, 2, o, and, langbeinite, mgso, 4, k, 2, so, 4, only, a, very, few, fertilizers, contain, potassium, nitrate, in, 2005, about, 93, of, world, potassium, production, was, consumed, by, the, fertilizer, industry, furthermore, potassium, can, play, a, key, role, in, nutrient, cycling, by, controlling, litter, composition, potassium, citrate, is, used, to, treat, a, kidney, stone, condition, called, renal, tubular, acidosis, potassium, in, the, form, of, potassium, chloride, is, used, as, a, medication, to, treat, and, prevent, low, blood,

this, surge, causes, the, plasma, potassium, to, rise, up, to, 10, before, clearance, by, renal, and, extrarenal, mechanisms, hypokalemia, a, deficiency, of, potassium, in, the, plasma, can, be, fatal, if, severe, common, causes, are, increased, gastrointestinal, loss, vomiting, diarrhea, and, increased, renal, loss, diuresis, deficiency, symptoms, include, muscle, weakness, paralytic, ileus, ecg, abnormalities, decreased, reflex, response, and, in, severe, cases, respiratory, paralysis, alkalosis, and, cardiac, arrhythmia, potassium, content, in, the, plasma, is, tightly, controlled, by, four, basic, mechanisms, which, have, various, names, and, classifications, these, are, collectively, the, first, three, are, sometimes, termed, the, external, potassium, homeostasis, system, and, the, first, two, the, reactive, potassium, homeostasis, system, renal, handling, of, potassium, is, closely, connected, to, sodium, handling, potassium, is, the, major, cation, positive, ion, inside, animal, cells, 150, mmol, l, 4, 8, g, l, while, sodium, is, the, major, cation, of, extracellular, fluid, 150, mmol, l, 3, 345, g, l, in, the, kidneys, about, 180, liters, of, plasma, is, filtered, through, the, glomeruli, and, into, the, renal, tubules, per, day, this, filtering, involves, about, 600, mg, of, sodium, and, 33, mg, of, potassium, since, only, 1, 10, mg, of, sodium, and, 1, 4, mg, of, potassium, are, likely, to, be, replaced, by, diet, renal, filtering, must, efficiently, reabsorb, the, remainder, from, the, plasma, sodium, is, reabsorbed, to, maintain, extracellular, volume, osmotic, pressure, and, serum, sodium, concentration, within, narrow, limits, potassium, is, reabsorbed, to, maintain, serum, potassium, concentration, within, narrow, limits, sodium, pumps, in, the, renal, tubules, operate, to, reabsorb, sodium, potassium, must, be, conserved, but, because, the, amount, of, potassium, in, the, blood, plasma, is, very, small, and, the, pool, of, potassium, in, the, cells, is, about, 30, times, as, large, the, situation, is, not, so, critical, for, potassium, since, potassium, is, moved, passively, in, counter, flow, to, sodium, in, response, to, an, apparent, but, not, actual, donnan, equilibrium, the, urine, can, never, sink, below, the, concentration, of, potassium, in, serum, except, sometimes, by, actively, excreting, water, at, the, end, of, the, processing, potassium, is, excreted, twice, and, reabsorbed, three, times, before, the, urine, reaches, the, collecting, tubules, at, that, point, urine, usually, has, about, the, same, potassium, concentration, as, plasma, at, the, end, of, the, processing, potassium, is, secreted, one, more, time, if, the, serum, levels, are, too, high, with, no, potassium, intake, it, is, excreted, at, about, 200, mg, per, day, until, in, about, a, week, potassium, in, the, serum, declines, to, a, mildly, deficient, level, of, 3, 0, 3, 5, mmol, l, if, potassium, is, still, withheld, the, concentration, continues, to, fall, until, a, severe, deficiency, causes, eventual, death, the, potassium, moves, passively, through, pores, in, the, cell, membrane, when, ions, move, through, ion, transporters, pumps, there, is, a, gate, in, the, pumps, on, both, sides, of, the, cell, membrane, and, only, one, gate, can, be, open, at, once, as, a, result, approximately, 100, ions, are, forced, through, per, second, ion, channels, have, only, one, gate, and, there, only, one, kind, of, ion, can, stream, through, at, 10, million, to, 100, million, ions, per, second, calcium, is, required, to, open, the, pores, although, calcium, may, work, in, reverse, by, blocking, at, least, one, of, the, pores, carbonyl, groups, inside, the, pore, on, the, amino, acids, mimic, the, water, hydration, that, takes, place, in, water, solution, by, the, nature, of, the, electrostatic, charges, on, four, carbonyl, groups, inside, the, pore, the, u, s, national, academy, of, medicine, nam, on, behalf, of, both, the, u, s, and, canada, sets, dietary, reference, intakes, including, estimated, average, requirements, ears, and, recommended, dietary, allowances, rdas, or, adequate, intakes, ais, for, when, there, is, not, sufficient, information, to, set, ears, and, rdas, for, both, males, and, females, under, 9, years, of, age, the, ais, for, potassium, are, 400, mg, of, potassium, for, 0, to, 6, month, old, infants, 860, mg, of, potassium, for, 7, to, 12, month, old, infants, 2, 000, mg, of, potassium, for, 1, to, 3, year, old, children, and, 2, 300, mg, of, potassium, for, 4, to, 8, year, old, children, for, males, 9, years, of, age, and, older, the, ais, for, potassium, are, 2, 500, mg, of, potassium, for, 9, to, 13, year, old, males, 3, 000, mg, of, potassium, for, 14, to, 18, year, old, males, and, 3, 400, mg, for, males, that, are, 19, years, of, age, and, older, for, females, 9, years, of, age, and, older, the, ais, for, potassium, are, 2, 300, mg, of, potassium, for, 9, to, 18, year, old, females, and, 2, 600, mg, of, potassium, for, females, that, are, 19, years, of, age, and, older, for, pregnant, and, lactating, females, the, ais, for, potassium, are, 2,

to, 18, year, old, lactating, females, and, 2, 800, mg, for, lactating, females, that, are, 19, years, of, age, and, older, as, for, safety, the, nam, also, sets, tolerable, upper, intake, levels, uls, for, vitamins, and, minerals, but, for, potassium, the, evidence, was, insufficient, so, no, ul, was, established, as, of, 2004, most, americans, adults, consume, less, than, 3, 000, mg, likewise, in, the, european, union, in, particular, in, germany, and, italy, insufficient, potassium, intake, is, somewhat, common, the, national, health, service, in, the, united, kingdom, recommends, a, similar, intake, saying, that, adults, 19, to, 64, years, need, need, 3500, mg, per, day, and, that, excess, amounts, may, cause, health, problems, such, as, stomach, pain, and, diarrhea, potassium, is, present, in, all, fruits, vegetables, meat, and, fish, foods, with, high, potassium, concentrations, include, yam, parsley, dried, apricots, milk, chocolate, all, nuts, especially, almonds, and, pistachios, potatoes, bamboo, shoots, bananas, avocados, coconut, water, soybeans, and, bran, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, also, lists, tomato, paste, orange, juice, beet, greens, white, beans, plantains, and, many, other, dietary, sources, of, potassium, ranked, in, descending, order, according, to, potassium, content, a, day, s, worth, of, potassium, is, in, 5, plantains, or, 11, bananas, diets, low, in, potassium, can, lead, to, hypertension, and, hypokalemia, supplements, of, potassium, are, most, widely, used, in, conjunction, with, diuretics, that, block, reabsorption, of, sodium, and, water, upstream, from, the, distal, tubule, thiazides, and, loop, diuretics, because, this, promotes, increased, distal, tubular, potassium, secretion, with, resultant, increased, potassium, excretion, a, variety, of, prescription, and, over, the, counter, supplements, are, available, potassium, chloride, may, be, dissolved, in, water, but, the, salty, bitter, taste, makes, liquid, supplements, unpalatable, potassium, is, also, available, in, tablets, or, capsules, which, are, formulated, to, allow, potassium, to, leach, slowly, out, of, a, matrix, since, very, high, concentrations, of, potassium, ion, that, occur, adjacent, to, a, solid, tablet, can, injure, the, gastric, or, intestinal, mucosa, for, this, reason, non, prescription, potassium, pills, are, limited, by, law, in, the, us, to, a, maximum, of, 99, mg, of, potassium, potassium, supplementation, can, also, be, combined, with, other, metabolites, such, as, citrate, or, chloride, to, achieve, specific, clinical, effects, potassium, supplements, may, be, employed, to, mitigate, the, impact, of, hypertension, thereby, reducing, cardiovascular, risk, potassium, chloride, and, potassium, bicarbonate, may, be, useful, to, control, mild, hypertension, in, 2020, potassium, was, the, 33rd, most, commonly, prescribed, medication, in, the, u, s, with, more, than, 17, million, prescriptions, potassium, supplementation, has, been, shown, to, reduce, both, systolic, and, diastolic, blood, pressure, in, individuals, with, essential, hypertension, additionally, potassium, supplements, may, be, employed, with, the, aim, of, preventing, the, formation, of, kidney, stones, a, condition, that, can, lead, to, renal, complications, if, left, untreated, low, potassium, levels, can, lead, to, decreased, calcium, reabsorption, in, the, kidneys, increasing, the, risk, of, elevated, urine, calcium, and, the, formation, of, kidney, stones, by, maintaining, adequate, potassium, levels, this, risk, can, be, reduced, the, mechanism, of, action, of, potassium, involves, various, types, of, transporters, and, channels, that, facilitate, its, movement, across, cell, membranes, this, process, can, lead, to, an, increase, in, the, pumping, of, hydrogen, ions, this, in, turn, can, escalate, the, production, of, gastric, acid, potentially, contributing, to, the, development, of, gastric, ulcers, potassium, has, a, role, in, bone, health, it, contributes, to, the, acid, base, equilibrium, in, the, body, and, helps, protect, bone, tissue, potassium, salts, produce, an, alkaline, component, that, can, aid, in, maintaining, bone, health, for, individuals, with, diabetes, potassium, supplementation, may, be, necessary, particularly, for, those, with, type, 2, diabetes, potassium, is, essential, for, the, secretion, of, insulin, by, pancreatic, beta, cells, which, helps, regulate, glucose, levels, without, sufficient, potassium, insulin, secretion, is, compromised, leading, to, hyperglycemia, and, worsening, diabetes, excessive, potassium, intake, can, have, adverse, effects, such, as, gastrointestinal, discomfort, and, disturbances, in, heart, rhythm, potassium, supplementation, can, have, side, effects, on, ulceration, particularly, in, relation, to, peptic, ulcer, disease, potassium, channels, have, the, potential, to, increase, gastric, acid, secretion, which, can, lead, to, an, increased, risk, of, ulcerations, medications, used, for, peptic, ulcer, disease, known, as, proton, pump, inhibitors, work, by, inhibiting, potassium, pumps, that, activate, the, h, k, atpase, this, inhibition, helps, to, reduce, the, secretion, of, hydrochloric, acid, into, the, parietal, cell, thereby, decreasing, acidic, synthesis, and, lowering, the, risk, of, ulcers, nicorandil, a, drug, used, for, the, treatment, of, ischemic, heart, disease, can, stimulate, nitrate, and, potassium, atp, channels, and, as, a, result, it, has, been, associated, with, side, effects, such, as, gi, oral, and, anal, ulcers, prolonged, and, chronic, use, of, potassium, supplements, has, been, linked, to, more, severe, side, effects, including, ulcers, outside, of, the, gastrointestinal, gi, tract, close, monitoring, is, necessary, for, patients, who, are, also, taking, angiotensinogen, converting, enzyme, inhibitors, angiotensin, receptor, blockers, or, potassium, sparing, diuretics, potassium, can, be, detected, by, taste, because, it, triggers, three, of, the, five, types, of, taste, sensations, according, to, concentration, dilute, solutions, of, potassium, ions, taste, sweet, allowing, moderate, concentrations, in, milk, and, juices, while, higher, concentrations, become, increasingly, bitter, alkaline, and, finally, also, salty, to, the, taste, the, combined, bitterness, and, saltiness, of, high, potassium, solutions, makes, high, dose, potassium, supplementation, by, liquid, drinks, a, palatability, challenge, potassium, metal, can, react, violently, with, water, producing, koh, and, hydrogen, gas, this, reaction, is, exothermic, and, releases, sufficient, heat, to, ignite, the, resulting, hydrogen, in, the, presence, of, oxygen, finely, powdered, potassium, ignites, in, air, at, room, temperature, the, bulk, metal, ignites, in, air, if, heated, because, its, density, is, 0,
