formaldehyde, f, r, m, l, d, h, a, d, for, mal, di, hide, us, also, f, r, f, r, systematic, name, methanal, is, an, organic, compound, with, the, chemical, formula, ch, 2, o, and, structure, h, cho, more, precisely, h, 2, c, o, the, compound, is, a, pungent, colourless, gas, that, polymerises, spontaneously, into, paraformaldehyde, it, is, stored, as, aqueous, solutions, formalin, which, consists, mainly, of, the, hydrate, ch, 2, oh, 2, it, is, the, simplest, of, the, aldehydes, r, cho, as, a, precursor, to, many, other, materials, and, chemical, compounds, in, 2006, the, global, production, of, formaldehyde, was, estimated, at, 12, million, tons, per, year, it, is, mainly, used, in, the, production, of, industrial, resins, e, g, for, particle, board, and, coatings, small, amounts, also, occur, naturally, formaldehyde, is, classified, as, a, carcinogen, and, can, cause, respiratory, and, skin, irritation, upon, exposure, formaldehyde, is, more, complicated, than, many, simple, carbon, compounds, in, that, it, adopts, several, diverse, forms, these, compounds, can, often, be, used, interchangeably, and, can, be, interconverted, a, small, amount, of, stabilizer, such, as, methanol, is, usually, added, to, suppress, oxidation, and, polymerization, a, typical, commercial, grade, formalin, may, contain, 10, 12, methanol, in, addition, to, various, metallic, impurities, formaldehyde, was, first, used, as, a, generic, trademark, in, 1893, following, a, previous, trade, name, formalin, molecular, formaldehyde, contains, a, central, carbon, atom, with, a, double, bond, to, the, oxygen, atom, and, a, single, bond, to, each, hydrogen, atom, this, structure, is, summarised, by, the, condensed, formula, h, 2, c, o, the, molecule, is, planar, y, shaped, and, its, molecular, symmetry, belongs, to, the, c, 2v, point, group, the, precise, molecular, geometry, of, gaseous, formaldehyde, has, been, determined, by, gas, electron, diffraction, and, microwave, spectroscopy, the, bond, lengths, are, 1, 21, for, the, carbon, oxygen, bond, and, around, 1, 11, for, the, carbon, hydrogen, bond, while, the, h, c, h, bond, angle, is, 117, close, to, the, 120, angle, found, in, an, ideal, trigonal, planar, molecule, some, excited, electronic, states, of, formaldehyde, are, pyramidal, rather, than, planar, as, in, the, ground, state, processes, in, the, upper, atmosphere, contribute, more, than, 80, of, the, total, formaldehyde, in, the, environment, formaldehyde, is, an, intermediate, in, the, oxidation, or, combustion, of, methane, as, well, as, of, other, carbon, compounds, e, g, in, forest, fires, automobile, exhaust, and, tobacco, smoke, when, produced, in, the, atmosphere, by, the, action, of, sunlight, and, oxygen, on, atmospheric, methane, and, other, hydrocarbons, it, becomes, part, of, smog, formaldehyde, has, also, been, detected, in, outer, space, formaldehyde, and, its, adducts, are, ubiquitous, in, nature, food, may, contain, formaldehyde, at, levels, 1, 100, mg, kg, formaldehyde, formed, in, the, metabolism, of, the, amino, acids, serine, and, threonine, is, found, in, the, bloodstream, of, humans, and, other, primates, at, concentrations, of, approximately, 50, micromolar, experiments, in, which, animals, are, exposed, to, an, atmosphere, containing, isotopically, labeled, formaldehyde, have, demonstrated, that, even, in, deliberately, exposed, animals, the, majority, of, formaldehyde, dna, adducts, found, in, non, respiratory, tissues, are, derived, from, endogenously, produced, formaldehyde, formaldehyde, does, not, accumulate, in, the, environment, because, it, is, broken, down, within, a, few, hours, by, sunlight, or, by, bacteria, present, in, soil, or, water, humans, metabolize, formaldehyde, quickly, converting, it, to, formic, acid, so, it, does, not, accumulate, it, nonetheless, presents, significant, health, concerns, as, a, contaminant, formaldehyde, appears, to, be, a, useful, probe, in, astrochemistry, due, to, prominence, of, the, 1, 10, 1, 11, and, 2, 11, 2, 12, k, doublet, transitions, it, was, the, first, polyatomic, organic, molecule, detected, in, the, interstellar, medium, since, its, initial, detection, in, 1969, it, has, been, observed, in, many, regions, of, the, galaxy, because, of, the, widespread, interest, in, interstellar, formaldehyde, it, has, been, extensively, studied, yielding, new, extragalactic, sources, a, proposed, mechanism, for, the, formation, is, the, hydrogenation, of, co, ice, hcn, hnc, h, 2, co, and, dust, have, also, been, observed, inside, the, comae, of, comets, c, 2012, f6, lemmon, and, c, 2012, s1, ison, formaldehyde, was, first, reported, in, 1859, by, the, russian, chemist, aleksandr, butlerov, 1828, 1886, in, his, paper, butlerov, referred, to, formaldehyde, as, dioxymethylen, methylene, dioxide, because, his, empirical, formula, for, it, was, incorrect, c, 4, h, 4, o, 4, it, was, conclusively, identified, by, august, wilhelm, von, hofmann, who, first, announced, the, production, of, formaldehyde, by, passing, methanol, vapor, in, air, over, hot, platinum, wire, with, modifications, hoffmann, s, method, remains, the, basis, of, the, present, day, industrial, route, solution, routes, to, formaldehyde, also, entail, oxidation, of, methanol, or, methyl, iodide, formaldehyde, is, produced, industrially, by, the, catalytic, oxidation, of, methanol, the, most, common, catalysts, are, silver, metal, iron, iii, oxide, iron, molybdenum, oxides, with, a, molybdenum, enriched, surface, or, vanadium, oxides, in, the, commonly, used, formox, process, methanol, and, oxygen, react, at, c, 250, 400, c, in, presence, of, iron, oxide, in, combination, with, molybdenum, and, or, vanadium, to, produce, formaldehyde, according, to, the, chemical, equation, the, silver, based, catalyst, usually, operates, at, a, higher, temperature, about, 650, c, two, chemical, reactions, on, it, simultaneously, produce, formaldehyde, that, shown, above, and, the, dehydrogenation, reaction, in, principle, formaldehyde, could, be, generated, by, oxidation, of, methane, but, this, route, is, not, industrially, viable, because, the, methanol, is, more, easily, oxidized, than, methane, formaldehyde, is, produced, via, several, enzyme, catalyzed, routes, living, beings, including, humans, produce, formaldehyde, as, part, of, their, metabolism, formaldehyde, is, key, to, several, bodily, functions, e, g, epigenetics, but, its, amount, must, also, be, tightly, controlled, to, avoid, self, poisoning, formaldehyde, is, catabolized, by, alcohol, dehydrogenase, adh5, and, aldehyde, dehydrogenase, aldh2, formaldehyde, is, a, building, block, in, the, synthesis, of, many, other, compounds, of, specialised, and, industrial, significance, it, exhibits, most, of, the, chemical, properties, of, other, aldehydes, but, is, more, reactive, monomeric, ch, 2, o, is, a, gas, and, is, rarely, encountered, in, the, laboratory, aqueous, formaldehyde, unlike, some, other, small, aldehydes, which, need, specific, conditions, to, oligomerize, through, aldol, condensation, oligomerizes, spontaneously, at, a, common, state, the, trimer, is, 1, 3, 5, trioxane, ch, 2, o, 3, is, typical, oligomer, many, cyclic, oligomers, of, other, sizes, have, been, isolated, similarly, formaldehyde, hydrates, to, give, the, geminal, diol, methanediol, which, condenses, further, to, form, hydroxy, terminated, oligomers, ho, ch, 2, o, n, h, the, polymer, is, called, paraformaldehyde, the, higher, concentration, of, formaldehyde, the, more, equilibrium, shifts, towards, polymerization, diluting, with, water, or, increasing, the, solution, temperature, as, well, as, adding, alcohols, such, as, methanol, or, ethanol, lowers, that, tendency, gaseous, formaldehyde, polymerizes, at, active, sites, on, vessel, walls, but, the, mechanism, of, the, reaction, is, unknown, small, amounts, of, hydrogen, chloride, or, boron, trifluoride, or, stannic, chloride, present, in, gaseous, formaldehyde, provide, the, catalytic, effect, and, make, the, polymerization, rapid, it, is, readily, oxidized, by, atmospheric, oxygen, into, formic, acid, for, this, reason, commercial, formaldehyde, is, typically, contaminated, with, formic, acid, formaldehyde, can, be, hydrogenated, into, methanol, in, the, cannizzaro, reaction, formaldehyde, and, base, react, to, produce, formic, acid, and, methanol, a, disproportionation, reaction, formaldehyde, reacts, with, many, compounds, resulting, in, hydroxymethylation, x, r, 2, n, rc, o, nr, sh, the, resulting, hydroxymethyl, derivatives, typically, react, further, thus, amines, give, hexahydro, 1, 3, 5, triazines, similarly, when, combined, with, hydrogen, sulfide, it, forms, trithiane, in, the, presence, of, acids, it, participates, in, electrophilic, aromatic, substitution, reactions, with, aromatic, compounds, resulting, in, hydroxymethylated, derivatives, when, conducted, in, the, presence, of, hydrogen, chloride, the, product, is, the, chloromethyl, compound, as, described, in, the, blanc, chloromethylation, if, the, arene, is, electron, rich, as, in, phenols, elaborate, condensations, ensue, with, 4, substituted, phenols, one, obtains, calixarenes, phenol, results, in, polymers, many, amino, acids, react, with, formaldehyde, cysteine, converts, to, thioproline, formaldehyde, is, a, common, precursor, to, more, complex, compounds, and, materials, in, approximate, order, of, decreasing, consumption, products, generated, from, formaldehyde, include, urea, formaldehyde, resin, melamine, resin, phenol, formaldehyde, resin, polyoxymethylene, plastics, 1, 4, butanediol, and, methylene, diphenyl, diisocyanate, the, textile, industry, uses, formaldehyde, based, resins, as, finishers, to, make, fabrics, crease, resistant, when, treated, with, phenol, urea, or, melamine, formaldehyde, produces, respectively, hard, thermoset, phenol, formaldehyde, resin, urea, formaldehyde, resin, and, melamine, resin, these, polymers, are, permanent, adhesives, used, in, plywood, and, carpeting, they, are, also, foamed, to, make, insulation, or, cast, into, moulded, products, production, of, formaldehyde, resins, accounts, for, more, than, half, of, formaldehyde, consumption, formaldehyde, is, also, a, precursor, to, polyfunctional, alcohols, such, as, pentaerythritol, which, is, used, to, make, paints, and, explosives, other, formaldehyde, derivatives, include, methylene, diphenyl, diisocyanate, an, important, component, in, polyurethane, paints, and, foams, and, hexamine, which, is, used, in, phenol, formaldehyde, resins, as, well, as, the, explosive, rdx, condensation, with, acetaldehyde, affords, pentaerythritol, a, chemical, necessary, in, synthesizing, petn, a, high, explosive, condensation, with, phenols, gives, phenol, formaldehyde, resins, an, aqueous, solution, of, formaldehyde, can, be, useful, as, a, disinfectant, as, it, kills, most, bacteria, and, fungi, including, their, spores, it, is, used, as, an, additive, in, vaccine, manufacturing, to, inactivate, toxins, and, pathogens, formaldehyde, releasers, are, used, as, biocides, in, personal, care, products, such, as, cosmetics, although, present, at, levels, not, normally, considered, harmful, they, are, known, to, cause, allergic, contact, dermatitis, in, certain, sensitised, individuals, aquarists, use, formaldehyde, as, a, treatment, for, the, parasites, ichthyophthirius, multifiliis, and, cryptocaryon, irritans, formaldehyde, is, one, of, the, main, disinfectants, recommended, for, destroying, anthrax, formaldehyde, is, also, approved, for, use, in, the, manufacture, of, animal, feeds, in, the, us, it, is, an, antimicrobial, agent, used, to, maintain, complete, animal, feeds, or, feed, ingredients, salmonella, negative, for, up, to, 21, days, formaldehyde, preserves, or, fixes, tissue, or, cells, the, process, involves, cross, linking, of, primary, amino, groups, the, european, union, has, banned, the, use, of, formaldehyde, as, a, biocide, including, embalming, under, the, biocidal, products, directive, 98, 8, ec, due, to, its, carcinogenic, properties, countries, with, a, strong, tradition, of, embalming, corpses, such, as, ireland, and, other, colder, weather, countries, have, raised, concerns, despite, reports, to, the, contrary, no, decision, on, the, inclusion, of, formaldehyde, on, annex, i, of, the, biocidal, products, directive, for, product, type, 22, embalming, and, taxidermist, fluids, had, been, made, as, of, september, 2009, formaldehyde, based, crosslinking, is, exploited, in, chip, on, chip, or, chip, sequencing, genomics, experiments, where, dna, binding, proteins, are, cross, linked, to, their, cognate, binding, sites, on, the, chromosome, and, analyzed, to, determine, what, genes, are, regulated, by, the, proteins, formaldehyde, is, also, used, as, a, denaturing, agent, in, rna, gel, electrophoresis, preventing, rna, from, forming, secondary, structures, a, solution, of, 4, formaldehyde, fixes, pathology, tissue, specimens, at, about, one, mm, per, hour, at, room, temperature, formaldehyde, and, an, 18, m, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, makes, marquis, reagent, which, can, identify, alkaloids, and, other, compounds, in, photography, formaldehyde, is, used, in, low, concentrations, for, the, process, c, 41, color, negative, film, stabilizer, in, the, final, wash, step, as, well, as, in, the, process, e, 6, pre, bleach, step, to, make, it, unnecessary, in, the, final, wash, in, view, of, its, widespread, use, toxicity, and, volatility, formaldehyde, poses, a, significant, danger, to, human, health, in, 2011, the, us, national, toxicology, program, described, formaldehyde, as, known, to, be, a, human, carcinogen, however, concerns, are, associated, with, chronic, long, term, exposure, by, inhalation, as, may, happen, from, thermal, or, chemical, decomposition, of, formaldehyde, based, resins, and, the, production, of, formaldehyde, resulting, from, the, combustion, of, a, variety, of, organic, compounds, for, example, exhaust, gases, as, formaldehyde, resins, are, used, in, many, construction, materials, it, is, one, of, the, more, common, indoor, air, pollutants, at, concentrations, above, 0, 1, ppm, in, air, formaldehyde, can, irritate, the, eyes, and, mucous, membranes, formaldehyde, inhaled, at, this, concentration, may, cause, headaches, a, burning, sensation, in, the, throat, and, difficulty, breathing, and, can, trigger, or, aggravate, asthma, symptoms, the, cdc, considers, formaldehyde, as, a, systemic, poison, formaldehyde, poisoning, can, cause, permanent, changes, in, the, nervous, system, s, functions, a, 1988, canadian, study, of, houses, with, urea, formaldehyde, foam, insulation, found, that, formaldehyde, levels, as, low, as, 0, 046, ppm, were, positively, correlated, with, eye, and, nasal, irritation, a, 2009, review, of, studies, has, shown, a, strong, association, between, exposure, to, formaldehyde, and, the, development, of, childhood, asthma, a, theory, was, proposed, for, the, carcinogenesis, of, formaldehyde, in, 1978, in, 1987, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, epa, classified, it, as, a, probable, human, carcinogen, and, after, more, studies, the, who, international, agency, for, research, on, cancer, iarc, in, 1995, also, classified, it, as, a, probable, human, carcinogen, further, information, and, evaluation, of, all, known, data, led, the, iarc, to, reclassify, formaldehyde, as, a, known, human, carcinogen, associated, with, nasal, sinus, cancer, and, nasopharyngeal, cancer, studies, in, 2009, and, 2010, have, also, shown, a, positive, correlation, between, exposure, to, formaldehyde, and, the, development, of, leukemia, particularly, myeloid, leukemia, nasopharyngeal, and, sinonasal, cancers, are, relatively, rare, with, a, combined, annual, incidence, in, the, united, states, of, 4, 000, cases, about, 30, 000, cases, of, myeloid, leukemia, occur, in, the, united, states, each, year, some, evidence, suggests, that, workplace, exposure, to, formaldehyde, contributes, to, sinonasal, cancers, professionals, exposed, to, formaldehyde, in, their, occupation, such, as, funeral, industry, workers, and, embalmers, showed, an, increased, risk, of, leukemia, and, brain, cancer, compared, with, the, general, population, other, factors, are, important, in, determining, individual, risk, for, the, development, of, leukemia, or, nasopharyngeal, cancer, in, yeast, formaldehyde, is, found, to, perturb, pathways, for, dna, repair, and, cell, cycle, in, the, residential, environment, formaldehyde, exposure, comes, from, a, number, of, routes, formaldehyde, can, be, emitted, by, treated, wood, products, such, as, plywood, or, particle, board, but, it, is, produced, by, paints, varnishes, floor, finishes, and, cigarette, smoking, as, well, in, july, 2016, the, u, s, epa, released, a, prepublication, version, of, its, final, rule, on, formaldehyde, emission, standards, for, composite, wood, products, these, new, rules, impact, manufacturers, importers, distributors, and, retailers, of, products, containing, composite, wood, including, fiberboard, particleboard, and, various, laminated, products, who, must, comply, with, more, stringent, record, keeping, and, labeling, requirements, the, u, s, epa, allows, no, more, than, 0, 016, ppm, formaldehyde, in, the, air, in, new, buildings, constructed, for, that, agency, a, u, s, environmental, protection, agency, study, found, a, new, home, measured, 0, 076, ppm, when, brand, new, and, 0, 045, ppm, after, 30, days, the, federal, emergency, management, agency, fema, has, also, announced, limits, on, the, formaldehyde, levels, in, trailers, purchased, by, that, agency, the, epa, recommends, the, use, of, exterior, grade, pressed, wood, products, with, phenol, instead, of, urea, resin, to, limit, formaldehyde, exposure, since, pressed, wood, products, containing, formaldehyde, resins, are, often, a, significant, source, of, formaldehyde, in, homes, the, eyes, are, most, sensitive, to, formaldehyde, exposure, the, lowest, level, at, which, many, people, can, begin, to, smell, formaldehyde, ranges, between, 0, 05, and, 1, ppm, the, maximum, concentration, value, at, the, workplace, is, 0, 3, ppm, in, controlled, chamber, studies, individuals, begin, to, sense, eye, irritation, at, about, 0, 5, ppm, 5, to, 20, percent, report, eye, irritation, at, 0, 5, to, 1, ppm, and, greater, certainty, for, sensory, irritation, occurred, at, 1, ppm, and, above, while, some, agencies, have, used, a, level, as, low, as, 0, 1, ppm, as, a, threshold, for, irritation, the, expert, panel, found, that, a, level, of, 0, 3, ppm, would, protect, against, nearly, all, irritation, in, fact, the, expert, panel, found, that, a, level, of, 1, 0, ppm, would, avoid, eye, irritation, the, most, sensitive, endpoint, in, 75, 95, of, all, people, exposed, formaldehyde, levels, in, building, environments, are, affected, by, a, number, of, factors, these, include, the, potency, of, formaldehyde, emitting, products, present, the, ratio, of, the, surface, area, of, emitting, materials, to, volume, of, space, environmental, factors, product, age, interactions, with, other, materials, and, ventilation, conditions, formaldehyde, emits, from, a, variety, of, construction, materials, furnishings, and, consumer, products, the, three, products, that, emit, the, highest, concentrations, are, medium, density, fiberboard, hardwood, plywood, and, particle, board, environmental, factors, such, as, temperature, and, relative, humidity, can, elevate, levels, because, formaldehyde, has, a, high, vapor, pressure, formaldehyde, levels, from, building, materials, are, the, highest, when, a, building, first, opens, because, materials, would, have, less, time, to, off, gas, formaldehyde, levels, decrease, over, time, as, the, sources, suppress, in, operating, rooms, formaldehyde, is, produced, as, a, byproduct, of, electrosurgery, and, is, present, in, surgical, smoke, exposing, surgeons, and, healthcare, workers, to, potentially, unsafe, concentrations, formaldehyde, levels, in, air, can, be, sampled, and, tested, in, several, ways, including, impinger, treated, sorbent, and, passive, monitors, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, has, measurement, methods, numbered, 2016, 2541, 3500, and, 3800, in, june, 2011, the, twelfth, edition, of, the, national, toxicology, program, ntp, report, on, carcinogens, roc, changed, the, listing, status, of, formaldehyde, from, reasonably, anticipated, to, be, a, human, carcinogen, to, known, to, be, a, human, carcinogen, concurrently, a, national, academy, of, sciences, nas, committee, was, convened, and, issued, an, independent, review, of, the, draft, u, s, epa, iris, assessment, of, formaldehyde, providing, a, comprehensive, health, effects, assessment, and, quantitative, estimates, of, human, risks, of, adverse, effects, for, most, people, irritation, from, formaldehyde, is, temporary, and, reversible, although, formaldehyde, can, cause, allergies, and, is, part, of, the, standard, patch, test, series, in, 2005, 06, it, was, the, seventh, most, prevalent, allergen, in, patch, tests, 9, 0, people, with, formaldehyde, allergy, are, advised, to, avoid, formaldehyde, releasers, as, well, e, g, quaternium, 15, imidazolidinyl, urea, and, diazolidinyl, urea, people, who, suffer, allergic, reactions, to, formaldehyde, tend, to, display, lesions, on, the, skin, in, the, areas, that, have, had, direct, contact, with, the, substance, such, as, the, neck, or, thighs, often, due, to, formaldehyde, released, from, permanent, press, finished, clothing, or, dermatitis, on, the, face, typically, from, cosmetics, formaldehyde, has, been, banned, in, cosmetics, in, both, sweden, and, japan, formaldehyde, occurs, naturally, and, is, an, essential, intermediate, in, cellular, metabolism, in, mammals, and, humans, according, to, the, american, chemistry, council, formaldehyde, is, found, in, every, living, system, from, plants, to, animals, to, humans, it, metabolizes, quickly, in, the, body, breaks, down, rapidly, is, not, persistent, and, does, not, accumulate, in, the, body, the, twelfth, edition, of, ntp, report, on, carcinogens, notes, that, food, and, water, contain, measureable, concentrations, of, formaldehyde, but, the, significance, of, ingestion, as, a, source, of, formaldehyde, exposure, for, the, general, population, is, questionable, food, formaldehyde, generally, occurs, in, a, bound, form, and, formaldehyde, is, unstable, in, an, aqueous, solution, in, humans, ingestion, of, as, little, as, 30, millilitres, 1, 0, us, fl, oz, of, 37, formaldehyde,
