https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec
the, parsec, symbol, pc, is, a, unit, of, length, used, to, measure, the, large, distances, to, astronomical, objects, outside, the, solar, system, approximately, equal, to, 3, 26, light, years, or, 206, 265, astronomical, units, au, i, e, 30, 9, trillion, kilometres, 19, 2, trillion, miles, the, parsec, unit, is, obtained, by, the, use, of, parallax, and, trigonometry, and, is, defined, as, the, distance, at, which, 1, au, subtends, an, angle, of, one, arcsecond, 1, 3600, of, a, degree, the, nearest, star, proxima, centauri, is, about, 1, 3, parsecs, 4, 2, light, years, from, the, sun, from, that, distance, the, gap, between, the, earth, and, the, sun, spans, slightly, less, than, 1, 3600, of, one, degree, of, view, most, stars, visible, to, the, naked, eye, are, within, a, few, hundred, parsecs, of, the, sun, with, the, most, distant, at, a, few, thousand, parsecs, and, the, andromeda, galaxy, at, over, 700, 000, parsecs, the, word, parsec, is, a, portmanteau, of, parallax, of, one, second, and, was, coined, by, the, british, astronomer, herbert, hall, turner, in, 1913, to, simplify, astronomers, calculations, of, astronomical, distances, from, only, raw, observational, data, partly, for, this, reason, it, is, the, unit, preferred, in, astronomy, and, astrophysics, though, the, light, year, remains, prominent, in, popular, science, texts, and, common, usage, although, parsecs, are, used, for, the, shorter, distances, within, the, milky, way, multiples, of, parsecs, are, required, for, the, larger, scales, in, the, universe, including, kilo, parsecs, kpc, for, the, more, distant, objects, within, and, around, the, milky, way, mega, parsecs, mpc, for, mid, distance, galaxies, and, giga, parsecs, gpc, for, many, quasars, and, the, most, distant, galaxies, in, august, 2015, the, international, astronomical, union, iau, passed, resolution, b2, which, as, part, of, the, definition, of, a, standardized, absolute, and, apparent, bolometric, magnitude, scale, mentioned, an, existing, explicit, definition, of, the, parsec, as, exactly, 648, 000, au, or, approximately, 3, 085, 677, 581, 491, 3673, 10, 16, metres, based, on, the, iau, 2012, definition, of, the, astronomical, unit, this, corresponds, to, the, small, angle, definition, of, the, parsec, found, in, many, astronomical, references, imagining, an, elongated, right, triangle, in, space, where, the, shorter, leg, measures, one, au, astronomical, unit, the, average, earth, sun, distance, and, the, subtended, angle, of, the, vertex, opposite, that, leg, measures, one, arcsecond, 1, 3600, of, a, degree, the, parsec, is, defined, as, the, length, of, the, adjacent, leg, the, value, of, a, parsec, can, be, derived, through, the, rules, of, trigonometry, the, distance, from, earth, whereupon, the, radius, of, its, solar, orbit, subtends, one, arcsecond, one, of, the, oldest, methods, used, by, astronomers, to, calculate, the, distance, to, a, star, is, to, record, the, difference, in, angle, between, two, measurements, of, the, position, of, the, star, in, the, sky, the, first, measurement, is, taken, from, the, earth, on, one, side, of, the, sun, and, the, second, is, taken, approximately, half, a, year, later, when, the, earth, is, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, sun, the, distance, between, the, two, positions, of, the, earth, when, the, two, measurements, were, taken, is, twice, the, distance, between, the, earth, and, the, sun, the, difference, in, angle, between, the, two, measurements, is, twice, the, parallax, angle, which, is, formed, by, lines, from, the, sun, and, earth, to, the, star, at, the, distant, vertex, then, the, distance, to, the, star, could, be, calculated, using, trigonometry, the, first, successful, published, direct, measurements, of, an, object, at, interstellar, distances, were, undertaken, by, german, astronomer, friedrich, wilhelm, bessel, in, 1838, who, used, this, approach, to, calculate, the, 3, 5, parsec, distance, of, 61, cygni, the, parallax, of, a, star, is, defined, as, half, of, the, angular, distance, that, a, star, appears, to, move, relative, to, the, celestial, sphere, as, earth, orbits, the, sun, equivalently, it, is, the, subtended, angle, from, that, star, s, perspective, of, the, semimajor, axis, of, the, earth, s, orbit, substituting, the, star, s, parallax, for, the, one, arcsecond, angle, in, the, imaginary, right, triangle, the, long, leg, of, the, triangle, will, measure, the, distance, from, the, sun, to, the, star, a, parsec, can, be, defined, as, the, length, of, the, right, triangle, side, adjacent, to, the, vertex, occupied, by, a, star, whose, parallax, angle, is, one, arcsecond, the, use, of, the, parsec, as, a, unit, of, distance, follows, naturally, from, bessel, s, method, because, the, distance, in, parsecs, can, be, computed, simply, as, the, reciprocal, of, the, parallax, angle, in, arcseconds, i, e, if, the, parallax, angle, is, 1, arcsecond, the, object, is, 1, pc, from, the, sun, if, the, parallax, angle, is, 0, 5, arcseconds, the, object, is, 2, pc, away, etc, no, trigonometric, functions, are, required, in, this, relationship, because, the, very, small, angles, involved, mean, that, the, approximate, solution, of, the, skinny, triangle, can, be, applied, though, it, may, have, been, used, before, the, term, parsec, was, first, mentioned, in, an, astronomical, publication, in, 1913, astronomer, royal, frank, watson, dyson, expressed, his, concern, for, the, need, of, a, name, for, that, unit, of, distance, he, proposed, the, name, astron, but, mentioned, that, carl, charlier, had, suggested, siriometer, and, herbert, hall, turner, had, proposed, parsec, it, was, turner, s, proposal, that, stuck, by, the, 2015, definition, 1, au, of, arc, length, subtends, an, angle, of, 1, at, the, center, of, the, circle, of, radius, 1, pc, that, is, 1, pc, 1, au, tan, 1, 206, 264, 8, au, by, definition, converting, from, degree, minute, second, units, to, radians, therefore, p, c, 180, 60, 60, a, u, 180, 60, 60, 149, 597, 870, 700, m, 96, 939, 420, 213, 600, 000, m, displaystyle, pi, mathrm, pc, 180, times, 60, times, 60, mathrm, au,

above, not, to, scale, s, represents, the, sun, and, e, the, earth, at, one, point, in, its, orbit, such, as, to, form, a, right, angle, at, s, thus, the, distance, es, is, one, astronomical, unit, au, the, angle, sde, is, one, arcsecond, 1, 3600, of, a, degree, so, by, definition, d, is, a, point, in, space, at, a, distance, of, one, parsec, from, the, sun, through, trigonometry, the, distance, sd, is, calculated, as, follows, s, d, e, s, tan, 1, e, s, tan, 1, 60, 60, 180, 1, a, u, 1, 60, 60, 180, 648, 000, a, u, 206, 264, 81, a, u, displaystyle, begin, aligned, mathrm, sd, frac, mathrm, es,

m, a, corollary, states, that, a, parsec, is, also, the, distance, from, which, a, disc, that, is, one, au, in, diameter, must, be, viewed, for, it, to, have, an, angular, diameter, of, one, arcsecond, by, placing, the, observer, at, d, and, a, disc, spanning, es, mathematically, to, calculate, distance, given, obtained, angular, measurements, from, instruments, in, arcseconds, the,

earth, sun, e, g, if, distance, earth, sun, 1, au, unit, for, distance, star, is, in, astronomical, units, if, distance, earth, sun, 1, 5813, 10, 5, ly, unit, for, distance, star, is, in, light, years, the, length, of, the, parsec, used, in, iau, 2015, resolution, b2, exactly, 648, 000, astronomical, units, corresponds, exactly, to, that, derived, using, the, small, angle, calculation, this, differs, from, the, classic, inverse, tangent, definition, by, about, 200, km, i, e, only, after, the, 11th, significant, figure, as, the, astronomical, unit, was, defined, by, the, iau, 2012, as, an, exact, length, in, metres, so, now, the, parsec, corresponds, to, an, exact, length, in, metres, to, the, nearest, meter, the, small, angle, parsec, corresponds, to, 30, 856, 775, 814, 913, 673, m, the, parallax, method, is, the, fundamental, calibration, step, for, distance, determination, in, astrophysics, however, the, accuracy, of, ground, based, telescope, measurements, of, parallax, angle, is, limited, to, about, 0, 01, and, thus, to, stars, no, more, than, 100, pc, distant, this, is, because, the, earth, s, atmosphere, limits, the, sharpness, of, a, star, s, image, space, based, telescopes, are, not, limited, by, this, effect, and, can, accurately, measure, distances, to, objects, beyond, the, limit, of, ground, based, observations, between, 1989, and, 1993, the, hipparcos, satellite, launched, by, the, european, space, agency, esa, measured, parallaxes, for, about, 100, 000, stars, with, an, astrometric, precision, of, about, 0, 97, mas, and, obtained, accurate, measurements, for, stellar, distances, of, stars, up, to, 1000, pc, away, esa, s, gaia, satellite, which, launched, on, 19, december, 2013, is, intended, to, measure, one, billion, stellar, distances, to, within, 20, microarcsecond, s, producing, errors, of, 10, in, measurements, as, far, as, the, galactic, centre, about, 8000, pc, away, in, the, constellation, of, sagittarius, distances, expressed, in, fractions, of, a, parsec, usually, involve, objects, within, a, single, star, system, so, for, example, distances, expressed, in, parsecs, pc, include, distances, between, nearby, stars, such, as, those, in, the, same, spiral, arm, or, globular, cluster, a, distance, of, 1, 000, parsecs, 3, 262, ly, is, denoted, by, the, kiloparsec, kpc, astronomers, typically, use, kiloparsecs, to, express, distances, between, parts, of, a, galaxy, or, within, groups, of, galaxies, so, for, example, astronomers, typically, express, the, distances, between, neighbouring, galaxies, and, galaxy, clusters, in, megaparsecs, mpc, a, megaparsec, is, one, million, parsecs, or, about, 3, 260, 000, light, years, sometimes, galactic, distances, are, given, in, units, of, mpc, h, as, in, 50, h, mpc, also, written, 50, mpc, h, 1, h, is, a, constant, the, dimensionless, hubble, constant, in, the, range, 0, 5, h, 0, 75, reflecting, the, uncertainty, in, the, value, of, the, hubble, constant, h, for, the, rate, of, expansion, of, the, universe, h, h, 100, km, s, mpc, the, hubble, constant, becomes, relevant, when, converting, an, observed, redshift, z, into, a, distance, d, using, the, formula, d, c, h, z, one, gigaparsec, gpc, is, one, billion, parsecs, one, of, the, largest, units, of, length, commonly, used, one, gigaparsec, is, about, 3, 26, billion, ly, or, roughly, 1, 14, of, the, distance, to, the, horizon, of, the, observable, universe, dictated, by, the, cosmic, microwave, background, radiation, astronomers, typically, use, gigaparsecs, to, express, the, sizes, of, large, scale, structures, such, as, the, size, of, and, distance, to, the, cfa2, great, wall, the, distances, between, galaxy, clusters, and, the, distance, to, quasars, for, example, to, determine, the, number, of, stars, in, the, milky, way, volumes, in, cubic, kiloparsecs, kpc, 3, are, selected, in, various, directions, all, the, stars, in, these, volumes, are, counted, and, the, total, number, of, stars, statistically, determined, the, number, of, globular, clusters, dust, clouds, and, interstellar, gas, is, determined, in, a, similar, fashion, to, determine, the, number, of, galaxies, in, superclusters, volumes, in, cubic, megaparsecs, mpc, 3, are, selected, all, the, galaxies, in, these, volumes, are, classified, and, tallied, the, total, number, of, galaxies, can, then, be, determined, statistically, the, huge, bo, tes, void, is, measured, in, cubic, megaparsecs, in, physical, cosmology, volumes, of, cubic, gigaparsecs, gpc, 3, are, selected, to, determine, the, distribution, of, matter, in, the, visible, universe, and, to, determine, the, number, of, galaxies, and, quasars, the, sun, is, currently, the, only, star, in, its, cubic, parsec, pc, 3, but, in, globular, clusters, the, stellar, density, could, be, from, 100, 1000, pc, 3, the, observational, volume, of, gravitational, wave, interferometers, e, g, ligo, virgo, is, stated, in, terms, of, cubic, megaparsecs, mpc, 3, and, is, essentially, the, value, of, the, effective, distance, cubed, the, parsec, was, used, incorrectly, as, a, measurement, of, time, by, han, solo, in, the, first, star, wars, film, when, he, claimed, his, ship, the, millennium, falcon, made, the, kessel, run, in, less, than, 12, parsecs, originally, with, the, intention, of, presenting, solo, as, something, of, a, bull, artist, who, didn, t, always, know, precisely, what, he, was, talking, about, the, claim, was, repeated, in, the, force, awakens, but, this, was, retconned, in, solo, a, star, wars, story, by, stating, the, millennium, falcon, traveled, a, shorter, distance, as, opposed, to, a, quicker, time, due, to, a, more, dangerous, route, through, the, kessel, run, enabled, by, its, speed, and, maneuverability, it, is, also, used, incorrectly, in, the, mandalorian, in, the, book, a, wrinkle, in, time, megaparsec, is, mr, murry, s, nickname, for, his, daughter, meg
