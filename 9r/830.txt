the, symmetry, of, a, physical, system, is, a, physical, or, mathematical, feature, of, the, system, observed, or, intrinsic, that, is, preserved, or, remains, unchanged, under, some, transformation, a, family, of, particular, transformations, may, be, continuous, such, as, rotation, of, a, circle, or, discrete, e, g, reflection, of, a, bilaterally, symmetric, figure, or, rotation, of, a, regular, polygon, continuous, and, discrete, transformations, give, rise, to, corresponding, types, of, symmetries, continuous, symmetries, can, be, described, by, lie, groups, while, discrete, symmetries, are, described, by, finite, groups, see, symmetry, group, these, two, concepts, lie, and, finite, groups, are, the, foundation, for, the, fundamental, theories, of, modern, physics, symmetries, are, frequently, amenable, to, mathematical, formulations, such, as, group, representations, and, can, in, addition, be, exploited, to, simplify, many, problems, arguably, the, most, important, example, of, a, symmetry, in, physics, is, that, the, speed, of, light, has, the, same, value, in, all, frames, of, reference, which, is, described, in, special, relativity, by, a, group, of, transformations, of, the, spacetime, known, as, the, poincar, group, another, important, example, is, the, invariance, of, the, form, of, physical, laws, under, arbitrary, differentiable, coordinate, transformations, which, is, an, important, idea, in, general, relativity, invariance, is, specified, mathematically, by, transformations, that, leave, some, property, e, g, quantity, unchanged, this, idea, can, apply, to, basic, real, world, observations, for, example, temperature, may, be, homogeneous, throughout, a, room, since, the, temperature, does, not, depend, on, the, position, of, an, observer, within, the, room, we, say, that, the, temperature, is, invariant, under, a, shift, in, an, observer, s, position, within, the, room, similarly, a, uniform, sphere, rotated, about, its, center, will, appear, exactly, as, it, did, before, the, rotation, the, sphere, is, said, to, exhibit, spherical, symmetry, a, rotation, about, any, axis, of, the, sphere, will, preserve, how, the, sphere, looks, the, above, ideas, lead, to, the, useful, idea, of, invariance, when, discussing, observed, physical, symmetry, this, can, be, applied, to, symmetries, in, forces, as, well, for, example, an, electric, field, due, to, an, electrically, charged, wire, of, infinite, length, is, said, to, exhibit, cylindrical, symmetry, because, the, electric, field, strength, at, a, given, distance, r, from, the, wire, will, have, the, same, magnitude, at, each, point, on, the, surface, of, a, cylinder, whose, axis, is, the, wire, with, radius, r, rotating, the, wire, about, its, own, axis, does, not, change, its, position, or, charge, density, hence, it, will, preserve, the, field, the, field, strength, at, a, rotated, position, is, the, same, this, is, not, true, in, general, for, an, arbitrary, system, of, charges, in, newton, s, theory, of, mechanics, given, two, bodies, each, with, mass, m, starting, at, the, origin, and, moving, along, the, x, axis, in, opposite, directions, one, with, speed, v, 1, and, the, other, with, speed, v, 2, the, total, kinetic, energy, of, the, system, as, calculated, from, an, observer, at, the, origin, is, 1, 2, m, v, 1, 2, v, 2, 2, and, remains, the, same, if, the, velocities, are, interchanged, the, total, kinetic, energy, is, preserved, under, a, reflection, in, the, y, axis, the, last, example, above, illustrates, another, way, of, expressing, symmetries, namely, through, the, equations, that, describe, some, aspect, of, the, physical, system, the, above, example, shows, that, the, total, kinetic, energy, will, be, the, same, if, v, 1, and, v, 2, are, interchanged, symmetries, may, be, broadly, classified, as, global, or, local, a, global, symmetry, is, one, that, keeps, a, property, invariant, for, a, transformation, that, is, applied, simultaneously, at, all, points, of, spacetime, whereas, a, local, symmetry, is, one, that, keeps, a, property, invariant, when, a, possibly, different, symmetry, transformation, is, applied, at, each, point, of, spacetime, specifically, a, local, symmetry, transformation, is, parameterised, by, the, spacetime, co, ordinates, whereas, a, global, symmetry, is, not, this, implies, that, a, global, symmetry, is, also, a, local, symmetry, local, symmetries, play, an, important, role, in, physics, as, they, form, the, basis, for, gauge, theories, the, two, examples, of, rotational, symmetry, described, above, spherical, and, cylindrical, are, each, instances, of, continuous, symmetry, these, are, characterised, by, invariance, following, a, continuous, change, in, the, geometry, of, the, system, for, example, the, wire, may, be, rotated, through, any, angle, about, its, axis, and, the, field, strength, will, be, the, same, on, a, given, cylinder, mathematically, continuous, symmetries, are, described, by, transformations, that, change, continuously, as, a, function, of, their, parameterization, an, important, subclass, of, continuous, symmetries, in, physics, are, spacetime, symmetries, continuous, spacetime, symmetries, are, symmetries, involving, transformations, of, space, and, time, these, may, be, further, classified, as, spatial, symmetries, involving, only, the, spatial, geometry, associated, with, a, physical, system, temporal, symmetries, involving, only, changes, in, time, or, spatio, temporal, symmetries, involving, changes, in, both, space, and, time, mathematically, spacetime, symmetries, are, usually, described, by, smooth, vector, fields, on, a, smooth, manifold, the, underlying, local, diffeomorphisms, associated, with, the, vector, fields, correspond, more, directly, to, the, physical, symmetries, but, the, vector, fields, themselves, are, more, often, used, when, classifying, the, symmetries, of, the, physical, system, some, of, the, most, important, vector, fields, are, killing, vector, fields, which, are, those, spacetime, symmetries, that, preserve, the, underlying, metric, structure, of, a, manifold, in, rough, terms, killing, vector, fields, preserve, the, distance, between, any, two, points, of, the, manifold, and, often, go, by, the, name, of, isometries, a, discrete, symmetry, is, a, symmetry, that, describes, non, continuous, changes, in, a, system, for, example, a, square, possesses, discrete, rotational, symmetry, as, only, rotations, by, multiples, of, right, angles, will, preserve, the, square, s, original, appearance, discrete, symmetries, sometimes, involve, some, type, of, swapping, these, swaps, usually, being, called, reflections, or, interchanges, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, has, three, related, natural, near, symmetries, these, state, that, the, universe, in, which, we, live, should, be, indistinguishable, from, one, where, a, certain, type, of, change, is, introduced, these, symmetries, are, near, symmetries, because, each, is, broken, in, the, present, day, universe, however, the, standard, model, predicts, that, the, combination, of, the, three, that, is, the, simultaneous, application, of, all, three, transformations, must, be, a, symmetry, called, cpt, symmetry, cp, violation, the, violation, of, the, combination, of, c, and, p, symmetry, is, necessary, for, the, presence, of, significant, amounts, of, baryonic, matter, in, the, universe, cp, violation, is, a, fruitful, area, of, current, research, in, particle, physics, a, type, of, symmetry, known, as, supersymmetry, has, been, used, to, try, to, make, theoretical, advances, in, the, standard, model, supersymmetry, is, based, on, the, idea, that, there, is, another, physical, symmetry, beyond, those, already, developed, in, the, standard, model, specifically, a, symmetry, between, bosons, and, fermions, supersymmetry, asserts, that, each, type, of, boson, has, as, a, supersymmetric, partner, a, fermion, called, a, superpartner, and, vice, versa, supersymmetry, has, not, yet, been, experimentally, verified, no, known, particle, has, the, correct, properties, to, be, a, superpartner, of, any, other, known, particle, currently, lhc, is, preparing, for, a, run, which, tests, supersymmetry, generalized, symmetries, encompass, a, number, of, recently, recognized, generalizations, of, the, concept, of, a, global, symmetry, these, include, higher, form, symmetries, higher, group, symmetries, non, invertible, symmetries, and, subsystem, symmetries, the, transformations, describing, physical, symmetries, typically, form, a, mathematical, group, group, theory, is, an, important, area, of, mathematics, for, physicists, continuous, symmetries, are, specified, mathematically, by, continuous, groups, called, lie, groups, many, physical, symmetries, are, isometries, and, are, specified, by, symmetry, groups, sometimes, this, term, is, used, for, more, general, types, of, symmetries, the, set, of, all, proper, rotations, about, any, angle, through, any, axis, of, a, sphere, form, a, lie, group, called, the, special, orthogonal, group, so, 3, the, 3, refers, to, the, three, dimensional, space, of, an, ordinary, sphere, thus, the, symmetry, group, of, the, sphere, with, proper, rotations, is, so, 3, any, rotation, preserves, distances, on, the, surface, of, the, ball, the, set, of, all, lorentz, transformations, form, a, group, called, the, lorentz, group, this, may, be, generalised, to, the, poincar, group, discrete, groups, describe, discrete, symmetries, for, example, the, symmetries, of, an, equilateral, triangle, are, characterized, by, the, symmetric, group, s, 3, a, type, of, physical, theory, based, on, local, symmetries, is, called, a, gauge, theory, and, the, symmetries, natural, to, such, a, theory, are, called, gauge, symmetries, gauge, symmetries, in, the, standard, model, used, to, describe, three, of, the, fundamental, interactions, are, based, on, the, su, 3, su, 2, u, 1, group, roughly, speaking, the, symmetries, of, the, su, 3, group, describe, the, strong, force, the, su, 2, group, describes, the, weak, interaction, and, the, u, 1, group, describes, the, electromagnetic, force, also, the, reduction, by, symmetry, of, the, energy, functional, under, the, action, by, a, group, and, spontaneous, symmetry, breaking, of, transformations, of, symmetric, groups, appear, to, elucidate, topics, in, particle, physics, for, example, the, unification, of, electromagnetism, and, the, weak, force, in, physical, cosmology, the, symmetry, properties, of, a, physical, system, are, intimately, related, to, the, conservation, laws, characterizing, that, system, noether, s, theorem, gives, a, precise, description, of, this, relation, the, theorem, states, that, each, continuous, symmetry, of, a, physical, system, implies, that, some, physical, property, of, that, system, is, conserved, conversely, each, conserved, quantity, has, a, corresponding, symmetry, for, example, spatial, translation, symmetry, i, e, homogeneity, of, space, gives, rise, to, conservation, of, linear, momentum, and, temporal, translation, symmetry, i, e, homogeneity, of, time, gives, rise, to, conservation, of, energy, the, following, table, summarizes, some, fundamental, symmetries, and, the, associated, conserved, quantity, continuous, symmetries, in, physics, preserve, transformations, one, can, specify, a, symmetry, by, showing, how, a, very, small, transformation, affects, various, particle, fields, the, commutator, of, two, of, these, infinitesimal, transformations, is, equivalent, to, a, third, infinitesimal, transformation, of, the, same, kind, hence, they, form, a, lie, algebra, a, general, coordinate, transformation, described, as, the, general, field, h, x, displaystyle, h, x, also, known, as, a, diffeomorphism, has, the, infinitesimal, effect, on, a, scalar, x, displaystyle, phi, x, spinor, x, displaystyle, psi, x, or, vector, field, a, x, displaystyle, a, x, that, can, be, expressed, using, the, einstein, summation, convention, without, gravity, only, the, poincar, symmetries, are, preserved, which, restricts, h, x, displaystyle, h, x, to, be, of, the, form, where, m, is, an, antisymmetric, matrix, giving, the, lorentz, and, rotational, symmetries, and, p, is, a, general, vector, giving, the, translational, symmetries, other, symmetries, affect, multiple, fields, simultaneously, for, example, local, gauge, transformations, apply, to, both, a, vector, and, spinor, field, where, displaystyle, tau, are, generators, of, a, particular, lie, group, so, far, the, transformations, on, the, right, have, only, included, fields, of, the, same, type, supersymmetries, are, defined, according, to, how, the, mix, fields, of, different, types, another, symmetry, which, is, part, of, some, theories, of, physics, and, not, in, others, is, scale, invariance, which, involve, weyl, transformations, of, the, following, kind, if, the, fields, have, this, symmetry, then, it, can, be, shown, that, the, field, theory, is, almost, certainly, conformally, invariant, also, this, means, that, in, the, absence, of, gravity, h, x, would, restricted, to, the, form, with, d, generating, scale, transformations, and, k, generating, special, conformal, transformations, for, example, n, 4, super, yang, mills, theory, has, this, symmetry, while, general, relativity, does, not, although, other, theories, of, gravity, such, as, conformal, gravity, do, the, action, of, a, field, theory, is, an, invariant, under, all, the, symmetries, of, the, theory, much, of, modern, theoretical, physics, is, to, do, with, speculating, on, the, various, symmetries, the, universe, may, have, and, finding, the, invariants, to, construct, field, theories, as, models, in, string, theories, since, a, string, can, be, decomposed, into, an, infinite, number, of, particle, fields, the, symmetries, on, the, string, world, sheet, is, equivalent, to, special, transformations, which, mix, an, infinite, number, of, fields
