mean, sea, level, msl, often, shortened, to, sea, level, is, an, average, surface, level, of, one, or, more, among, earth, s, coastal, bodies, of, water, from, which, heights, such, as, elevation, may, be, measured, the, global, msl, is, a, type, of, vertical, datum, a, standardised, geodetic, datum, that, is, used, for, example, as, a, chart, datum, in, cartography, and, marine, navigation, or, in, aviation, as, the, standard, sea, level, at, which, atmospheric, pressure, is, measured, to, calibrate, altitude, and, consequently, aircraft, flight, levels, a, common, and, relatively, straightforward, mean, sea, level, standard, is, instead, a, long, term, average, of, tide, gauge, readings, at, a, particular, reference, location, sea, levels, can, be, affected, by, many, factors, and, are, known, to, have, varied, greatly, over, geological, time, scales, current, sea, level, rise, is, mainly, caused, by, human, induced, climate, change, when, temperatures, rise, mountain, glaciers, and, polar, ice, sheets, melt, increasing, the, amount, of, water, in, the, oceans, while, the, existing, seawater, also, expands, with, heat, because, most, of, human, settlement, and, infrastructure, was, built, in, response, to, a, more, normalized, sea, level, with, limited, expected, change, populations, affected, by, sea, level, rise, will, need, to, invest, in, climate, adaptation, to, mitigate, the, worst, effects, or, when, populations, are, at, extreme, risk, a, process, of, managed, retreat, the, term, above, sea, level, generally, refers, to, the, height, above, mean, sea, level, amsl, the, term, apsl, means, above, present, sea, level, comparing, sea, levels, in, the, past, with, the, level, today, earth, s, radius, at, sea, level, is, 6, 378, 137, km, 3, 963, 191, mi, at, the, equator, it, is, 6, 356, 752, km, 3, 949, 903, mi, at, the, poles, and, 6, 371, 001, km, 3, 958, 756, mi, on, average, this, flattened, spheroid, combined, with, local, gravity, anomalies, defines, the, geoid, of, the, earth, which, approximates, the, local, mean, sea, level, for, locations, in, the, open, ocean, the, geoid, includes, a, significant, depression, in, the, indian, ocean, whose, surface, dips, as, much, as, 106, m, 348, ft, below, the, global, mean, sea, level, excluding, minor, effects, such, as, tides, and, currents, precise, determination, of, a, mean, sea, level, is, difficult, because, of, the, many, factors, that, affect, sea, level, instantaneous, sea, level, varies, substantially, on, several, scales, of, time, and, space, this, is, because, the, sea, is, in, constant, motion, affected, by, the, tides, wind, atmospheric, pressure, local, gravitational, differences, temperature, salinity, and, so, forth, the, mean, sea, level, at, a, particular, location, may, be, calculated, over, an, extended, time, period, and, used, as, a, datum, for, example, hourly, measurements, may, be, averaged, over, a, full, metonic, 19, year, lunar, cycle, to, determine, the, mean, sea, level, at, an, official, tide, gauge, still, water, level, or, still, water, sea, level, swl, is, the, level, of, the, sea, with, motions, such, as, wind, waves, averaged, out, then, msl, implies, the, swl, further, averaged, over, a, period, of, time, such, that, changes, due, to, e, g, the, tides, also, have, zero, mean, global, msl, refers, to, a, spatial, average, over, the, entire, ocean, area, typically, using, large, sets, of, tide, gauges, and, or, satellite, measurements, one, often, measures, the, values, of, msl, with, respect, to, the, land, hence, a, change, in, relative, msl, or, relative, sea, level, can, result, from, a, real, change, in, sea, level, or, from, a, change, in, the, height, of, the, land, on, which, the, tide, gauge, operates, or, both, in, the, uk, the, ordnance, datum, the, 0, metres, height, on, uk, maps, is, the, mean, sea, level, measured, at, newlyn, in, cornwall, between, 1915, and, 1921, before, 1921, the, vertical, datum, was, msl, at, the, victoria, dock, liverpool, since, the, times, of, the, russian, empire, in, russia, and, its, other, former, parts, now, independent, states, the, sea, level, is, measured, from, the, zero, level, of, kronstadt, sea, gauge, in, hong, kong, mpd, is, a, surveying, term, meaning, metres, above, principal, datum, and, refers, to, height, of, 0, 146, m, 5, 7, in, above, chart, datum, and, 1, 304, m, 4, ft, 3, 3, in, below, the, average, sea, level, in, france, the, mar, graphe, in, marseilles, measures, continuously, the, sea, level, since, 1883, and, offers, the, longest, collated, data, about, the, sea, level, it, is, used, for, a, part, of, continental, europe, and, the, main, part, of, africa, as, the, official, sea, level, spain, uses, the, reference, to, measure, heights, below, or, above, sea, level, at, alicante, while, the, european, vertical, reference, system, is, calibrated, to, the, amsterdam, peil, elevation, which, dates, back, to, the, 1690s, satellite, altimeters, have, been, making, precise, measurements, of, sea, level, since, the, launch, of, topex, poseidon, in, 1992, a, joint, mission, of, nasa, and, cnes, topex, poseidon, was, followed, by, jason, 1, in, 2001, and, the, ocean, surface, topography, mission, on, the, jason, 2, satellite, in, 2008, height, above, mean, sea, level, amsl, is, the, elevation, on, the, ground, or, altitude, in, the, air, of, an, object, relative, to, a, reference, datum, for, mean, sea, level, msl, it, is, also, used, in, aviation, where, some, heights, are, recorded, and, reported, with, respect, to, mean, sea, level, contrast, with, flight, level, and, in, the, atmospheric, sciences, and, in, land, surveying, an, alternative, is, to, base, height, measurements, on, a, reference, ellipsoid, approximating, the, entire, earth, which, is, what, systems, such, as, gps, do, in, aviation, the, reference, ellipsoid, known, as, wgs84, is, increasingly, used, to, define, heights, however, differences, up, to, 100, metres, 328, feet, exist, between, this, ellipsoid, height, and, local, mean, sea, level, another, alternative, is, to, use, a, geoid, based, vertical, datum, such, as, navd88, and, the, global, egm96, part, of, wgs84, details, vary, in, different, countries, when, referring, to, geographic, features, such, as, mountains, on, a, topographic, map, variations, in, elevation, are, shown, by, contour, lines, a, mountain, s, highest, point, or, summit, is, typically, illustrated, with, the, amsl, height, in, metres, feet, or, both, in, unusual, cases, where, a, land, location, is, below, sea, level, such, as, death, valley, california, the, elevation, amsl, is, negative, it, is, often, necessary, to, compare, the, local, height, of, the, mean, sea, surface, with, a, level, reference, surface, or, geodetic, datum, called, the, geoid, in, the, absence, of, external, forces, the, local, mean, sea, level, would, coincide, with, this, geoid, surface, being, an, equipotential, surface, of, the, earth, s, gravitational, field, which, in, itself, does, not, conform, to, a, simple, sphere, or, ellipsoid, and, exhibits, gravity, anomalies, such, as, those, measured, by, nasa, s, grace, satellites, in, reality, the, geoid, surface, is, not, directly, observed, even, as, a, long, term, average, due, to, ocean, currents, air, pressure, variations, temperature, and, salinity, variations, etc, the, location, dependent, but, time, persistent, separation, between, local, mean, sea, level, and, the, geoid, is, referred, to, as, mean, ocean, surface, topography, it, varies, globally, in, a, typical, range, of, 1, m, 3, ft, several, terms, are, used, to, describe, the, changing, relationships, between, sea, level, and, dry, land, the, melting, of, glaciers, at, the, end, of, ice, ages, results, in, isostatic, post, glacial, rebound, when, land, rises, after, the, weight, of, ice, is, removed, conversely, older, volcanic, islands, experience, relative, sea, level, rise, due, to, isostatic, subsidence, from, the, weight, of, cooling, volcanos, the, subsidence, of, land, due, to, the, withdrawal, of, groundwater, is, another, isostatic, cause, of, relative, sea, level, rise, on, planets, that, lack, a, liquid, ocean, planetologists, can, calculate, a, mean, altitude, by, averaging, the, heights, of, all, points, on, the, surface, this, altitude, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, sea, level, or, zero, level, elevation, serves, equivalently, as, a, reference, for, the, height, of, planetary, features, local, mean, sea, level, lmsl, is, defined, as, the, height, of, the, sea, with, respect, to, a, land, benchmark, averaged, over, a, period, of, time, long, enough, that, fluctuations, caused, by, waves, and, tides, are, smoothed, out, typically, a, year, or, more, one, must, adjust, perceived, changes, in, lmsl, to, account, for, vertical, movements, of, the, land, which, can, occur, at, rates, similar, to, sea, level, changes, millimetres, per, year, some, land, movements, occur, because, of, isostatic, adjustment, to, the, melting, of, ice, sheets, at, the, end, of, the, last, ice, age, the, weight, of, the, ice, sheet, depresses, the, underlying, land, and, when, the, ice, melts, away, the, land, slowly, rebounds, changes, in, ground, based, ice, volume, also, affect, local, and, regional, sea, levels, by, the, readjustment, of, the, geoid, and, true, polar, wander, atmospheric, pressure, ocean, currents, and, local, ocean, temperature, changes, can, affect, lmsl, as, well, eustatic, sea, level, change, global, as, opposed, to, local, change, is, due, to, change, in, either, the, volume, of, water, in, the, world, s, oceans, or, the, volume, of, the, oceanic, basins, two, major, mechanisms, are, currently, causing, eustatic, sea, level, rise, first, shrinking, land, ice, such, as, mountain, glaciers, and, polar, ice, sheets, is, releasing, water, into, the, oceans, second, as, ocean, temperatures, rise, the, warmer, water, expands, many, factors, can, produce, short, term, changes, in, sea, level, typically, within, a, few, metres, in, timeframes, ranging, from, minutes, to, months, between, 1901, and, 2018, the, average, sea, level, rose, by, 15, 25, cm, 6, 10, in, with, an, increase, of, 2, 3, mm, 0, 091, in, per, year, since, the, 1970s, 1216, this, was, faster, than, the, sea, level, had, ever, risen, over, at, least, the, past, 3, 000, years, 1216, the, rate, accelerated, to, 4, 62, mm, 0, 182, in, yr, for, the, decade, 2013, 2022, climate, change, due, to, human, activities, is, the, main, cause, 5, 8, between, 1993, and, 2018, melting, ice, sheets, and, glaciers, accounted, for, 44, of, sea, level, rise, with, another, 42, resulting, from, thermal, expansion, of, water, 1576, sea, level, rise, lags, behind, changes, in, the, earth, s, temperature, by, many, decades, and, sea, level, rise, will, therefore, continue, to, accelerate, between, now, and, 2050, in, response, to, warming, that, has, already, happened, what, happens, after, that, depends, on, human, greenhouse, gas, emissions, if, there, are, very, deep, cuts, in, emissions, sea, level, rise, would, slow, between, 2050, and, 2100, it, could, then, reach, by, 2100, slightly, over, 30, cm, 1, ft, from, now, and, approximately, 60, cm, 2, ft, from, the, 19th, century, with, high, emissions, it, would, instead, accelerate, further, and, could, rise, by, 1, 01, m, 3, 1, 3, ft, or, even, 1, 6, m, 5, 1, 3, ft, by, 2100, 1302, in, the, long, run, sea, level, rise, would, amount, to, 2, 3, m, 7, 10, ft, over, the, next, 2000, years, if, warming, stays, to, its, current, 1, 5, c, 2, 7, f, over, the, pre, industrial, past, it, would, be, 19, 22, metres, 62, 72, ft, if, warming, peaks, at, 5, c, 9, 0, f, 21, rising, seas, affect, every, coastal, and, island, population, on, earth, this, can, be, through, flooding, higher, storm, surges, king, tides, and, tsunamis, there, are, many, knock, on, effects, they, lead, to, loss, of, coastal, ecosystems, like, mangroves, crop, yields, may, reduce, because, of, increasing, salt, levels, in, irrigation, water, damage, to, ports, disrupts, sea, trade, the, sea, level, rise, projected, by, 2050, will, expose, places, currently, inhabited, by, tens, of, millions, of, people, to, annual, flooding, without, a, sharp, reduction, in, greenhouse, gas, emissions, this, may, increase, to, hundreds, of, millions, in, the, latter, decades, of, the, century, local, factors, like, tidal, range, or, land, subsidence, will, greatly, affect, the, severity, of, impacts, for, instance, sea, level, rise, in, the, united, states, is, likely, to, be, two, to, three, times, greater, than, the, global, average, by, the, end, of, the, century, yet, of, the, 20, countries, with, the, greatest, exposure, to, sea, level, rise, twelve, are, in, asia, including, indonesia, bangladesh, and, the, philippines, the, resilience, and, adaptive, capacity, of, ecosystems, and, countries, also, varies, which, will, result, in, more, or, less, pronounced, impacts, the, greatest, impact, on, human, populations, in, the, near, term, will, occur, in, the, low, lying, caribbean, and, pacific, islands, sea, level, rise, will, make, many, of, them, uninhabitable, later, this, century, pilots, can, estimate, height, above, sea, level, with, an, altimeter, set, to, a, defined, barometric, pressure, generally, the, pressure, used, to, set, the, altimeter, is, the, barometric, pressure, that, would, exist, at, msl, in, the, region, being, flown, over, this, pressure, is, referred, to, as, either, qnh, or, altimeter, and, is, transmitted, to, the, pilot, by, radio, from, air, traffic, control, atc, or, an, automatic, terminal, information, service, atis, since, the, terrain, elevation, is, also, referenced, to, msl, the, pilot, can, estimate, height, above, ground, by, subtracting, the, terrain, altitude, from, the, altimeter, reading, aviation, charts, are, divided, into, boxes, and, the, maximum, terrain, altitude, from, msl, in, each, box, is, clearly, indicated, once, above, the, transition, altitude, the, altimeter, is, set, to, the, international, standard, atmosphere, isa, pressure, at, msl, which, is, 1013, 25, hpa, or, 29, 92, inhg
