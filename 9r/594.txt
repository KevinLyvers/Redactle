tuff, is, a, type, of, rock, made, of, volcanic, ash, ejected, from, a, vent, during, a, volcanic, eruption, following, ejection, and, deposition, the, ash, is, lithified, into, a, solid, rock, rock, that, contains, greater, than, 75, ash, is, considered, tuff, while, rock, containing, 25, to, 75, ash, is, described, as, tuffaceous, for, example, tuffaceous, sandstone, tuff, composed, of, sandy, volcanic, material, can, be, referred, to, as, volcanic, sandstone, tuff, is, a, relatively, soft, rock, so, it, has, been, used, for, construction, since, ancient, times, because, it, is, common, in, italy, the, romans, used, it, often, for, construction, the, rapa, nui, people, used, it, to, make, most, of, the, moai, statues, on, easter, island, tuff, can, be, classified, as, either, igneous, or, sedimentary, rock, it, is, usually, studied, in, the, context, of, igneous, petrology, although, it, is, sometimes, described, using, sedimentological, terms, tuff, is, often, erroneously, called, tufa, in, guidebooks, and, in, television, programs, but, tufa, is, a, form, of, travertine, the, material, that, is, expelled, in, a, volcanic, eruption, can, be, classified, into, three, types, tephra, is, made, when, magma, inside, the, volcano, is, blown, apart, by, the, rapid, expansion, of, hot, volcanic, gases, magma, commonly, explodes, as, the, gas, dissolved, in, it, comes, out, of, solution, as, the, pressure, decreases, when, it, flows, to, the, surface, these, violent, explosions, produce, particles, of, material, that, can, then, fly, from, the, volcano, solid, particles, smaller, than, 2, mm, in, diameter, sand, sized, or, smaller, are, called, volcanic, ash, volcanic, ash, is, further, divided, into, fine, ash, with, particle, sizes, smaller, than, 0, 0625, mm, in, diameter, and, coarse, ash, with, particle, sizes, between, 0, 0625, mm, and, 2, mm, in, diameter, tuff, is, correspondingly, divided, into, coarse, tuff, coarse, ash, tuff, and, fine, tuff, fine, ash, tuff, or, dust, tuff, consolidated, tephra, composed, mostly, of, coarser, particles, is, called, lapillistone, particles, 2, mm, to, 64, mm, in, diameter, or, agglomerate, or, pyroclastic, breccia, particles, over, 64, mm, in, diameter, rather, than, tuff, volcanic, ash, can, vary, greatly, in, composition, and, so, tuffs, are, further, classified, by, the, composition, of, the, ash, from, which, they, formed, ash, from, high, silica, volcanism, particularly, in, ash, flows, consists, mainly, of, shards, of, volcanic, glass, and, tuff, formed, predominantly, from, glass, shards, is, described, as, vitric, tuff, the, glass, shards, are, typically, either, irregular, in, shape, or, are, roughly, triangular, with, convex, sides, they, are, the, shattered, walls, of, countless, small, bubbles, that, formed, in, the, magma, as, dissolved, gases, rapidly, came, out, of, solution, tuffs, formed, from, ash, consisting, predominantly, of, individual, crystals, are, described, as, crystal, tuffs, while, those, formed, from, ash, consisting, predominantly, of, pulverized, rock, fragments, are, described, as, lithic, tuffs, the, chemical, composition, of, volcanic, ash, reflects, the, entire, range, of, volcanic, rock, chemistry, from, high, silica, rhyolitic, ash, to, low, silica, basaltic, ash, and, tuffs, are, likewise, described, as, rhyolitic, andesitic, basaltic, and, so, on, the, most, straightforward, way, for, volcanic, ash, to, move, away, from, the, vent, is, as, ash, clouds, that, are, part, of, an, eruption, column, these, fall, to, the, surface, as, fallout, deposits, that, are, characteristically, well, sorted, and, tend, to, form, a, blanket, of, uniform, thickness, across, terrain, column, collapse, results, in, a, more, spectacular, and, destructive, form, of, transport, which, takes, the, form, of, pyroclastic, flows, and, surges, that, characteristically, are, poorly, sorted, and, pool, in, low, terrain, surge, deposits, sometimes, show, sedimentary, structures, typical, of, high, velocity, flow, such, as, dunes, and, antidunes, volcanic, ash, already, deposited, on, the, surface, can, be, transported, as, mud, flows, lahars, when, mingled, with, water, from, rainfall, or, through, eruption, into, a, body, of, water, or, ice, particles, of, volcanic, ash, that, are, sufficiently, hot, will, weld, together, after, settling, to, the, surface, producing, a, welded, tuff, welding, requires, temperatures, in, excess, of, 600, c, 1, 100, f, if, the, rock, contains, scattered, pea, sized, fragments, or, fiamme, in, it, it, is, called, a, welded, lapilli, tuff, welded, tuffs, and, welded, lapilli, tuffs, can, be, of, fallout, origin, or, deposited, from, ash, flows, as, in, the, case, of, ignimbrites, during, welding, the, glass, shards, and, pumice, fragments, adhere, together, necking, at, point, contacts, deform, and, compact, together, resulting, in, a, eutaxitic, fabric, welded, tuff, is, commonly, rhyolitic, in, composition, but, examples, of, all, compositions, are, known, a, sequence, of, ash, flows, may, consist, of, multiple, cooling, units, these, can, be, distinguished, by, the, degree, of, welding, the, base, of, a, cooling, unit, is, typically, unwelded, due, to, chilling, from, the, underlying, cold, surface, and, the, degree, of, welding, and, of, secondary, reactions, from, fluids, in, the, flow, increases, upwards, towards, the, center, of, the, flow, welding, decreases, towards, the, top, of, the, cooling, unit, where, the, unit, cools, more, rapidly, the, intensity, of, welding, may, also, decrease, towards, areas, in, which, the, deposit, is, thinner, and, with, distance, from, source, cooler, pyroclastic, flows, are, unwelded, and, the, ash, sheets, deposited, by, them, are, relatively, unconsolidated, however, cooled, volcanic, ash, can, quickly, become, lithified, because, it, usually, has, a, high, content, of, volcanic, glass, this, is, a, thermodynamically, unstable, material, that, reacts, rapidly, with, ground, water, or, sea, water, which, leaches, alkali, metals, and, calcium, from, the, glass, new, minerals, such, as, zeolites, clays, and, calcite, crystallize, from, the, dissolved, substances, and, cement, the, tuff, tuffs, are, further, classified, by, their, depositional, environment, such, as, lacustrine, tuff, subaerial, tuff, or, submarine, tuff, or, by, the, mechanism, by, which, the, ash, was, transported, such, as, fallout, tuff, or, ash, flow, tuff, reworked, tuffs, formed, by, erosion, and, redeposition, of, ash, deposits, are, usually, described, by, the, transport, agent, such, as, aeolian, tuff, or, fluvial, tuff, tuffs, have, the, potential, to, be, deposited, wherever, explosive, volcanism, takes, place, and, so, have, a, wide, distribution, in, location, and, age, rhyolite, tuffs, contain, pumiceous, glassy, fragments, and, small, scoriae, with, quartz, alkali, feldspar, biotite, etc, iceland, lipari, hungary, the, basin, and, range, of, the, american, southwest, and, new, zealand, are, among, the, areas, where, such, tuffs, are, prominent, in, the, ancient, rocks, of, wales, charnwood, etc, similar, tuffs, are, known, but, in, all, cases, they, are, greatly, changed, by, silicification, which, has, filled, them, with, opal, chalcedony, and, quartz, and, by, devitrification, the, frequent, presence, of, rounded, corroded, quartz, crystals, such, as, occur, in, rhyolitic, lavas, helps, to, demonstrate, their, real, nature, welded, ignimbrites, can, be, highly, voluminous, such, as, the, lava, creek, tuff, erupted, from, yellowstone, caldera, in, wyoming, 631, 000, years, ago, this, tuff, had, an, original, volume, of, at, least, 1, 000, cubic, kilometers, 240, cu, mi, lava, creek, tuff, is, known, to, be, at, least, 1000, times, as, large, as, the, deposits, of, the, 1980, eruption, of, mount, st, helens, and, it, had, a, volcanic, explosivity, index, vei, of, 8, greater, than, any, eruption, known, in, the, last, 10, 000, years, ash, flow, tuffs, cover, 7, 000, square, kilometers, 2, 700, sq, mi, of, the, north, island, of, new, zealand, and, about, 100, 000, square, kilometers, 39, 000, sq, mi, of, nevada, ash, flow, tuffs, are, the, only, volcanic, product, with, volumes, rivaling, those, of, flood, basalts, the, tioga, bentonite, of, the, northeastern, united, states, varies, in, composition, from, crystal, tuff, to, tuffaceous, shale, it, was, deposited, as, ash, carried, by, wind, that, fell, out, over, the, sea, and, settled, to, the, bottom, it, is, devonian, in, age, and, likely, came, from, a, vent, in, central, virginia, where, the, tuff, reaches, its, maximum, thickness, of, about, 40, meters, 130, ft, trachyte, tuffs, contain, little, or, no, quartz, but, much, sanidine, or, anorthoclase, and, sometimes, oligoclase, feldspar, with, occasional, biotite, augite, and, hornblende, in, weathering, they, often, change, to, soft, red, or, yellow, claystones, rich, in, kaolin, with, secondary, quartz, recent, trachyte, tuffs, are, found, on, the, rhine, at, siebengebirge, in, ischia, and, near, naples, trachyte, carbonatite, tuffs, have, been, identified, in, the, east, african, rift, alkaline, crystal, tuffs, have, been, reported, from, rio, de, janeiro, andesitic, tuffs, are, exceedingly, common, they, occur, along, the, whole, chain, of, the, cordilleras, and, andes, in, the, west, indies, new, zealand, japan, etc, in, the, lake, district, north, wales, lorne, the, pentland, hills, the, cheviots, and, many, other, districts, of, great, britain, ancient, rocks, of, exactly, similar, nature, are, abundant, in, color, they, are, red, or, brown, their, scoriae, fragments, are, of, all, sizes, from, huge, blocks, down, to, minute, granular, dust, the, cavities, are, filled, with, many, secondary, minerals, such, as, calcite, chlorite, quartz, epidote, or, chalcedony, in, microscopic, sections, though, the, nature, of, the, original, lava, can, nearly, always, be, made, out, from, the, shapes, and, properties, of, the, little, crystals, which, occur, in, the, decomposed, glassy, base, even, in, the, smallest, details, these, ancient, tuffs, have, a, complete, resemblance, to, the, modern, ash, beds, of, cotopaxi, krakatoa, and, mont, pel, mafic, volcanism, typically, takes, the, form, of, hawaiian, eruptions, that, are, nonexplosive, and, produce, little, ash, however, interaction, between, basaltic, magma, and, groundwater, or, sea, water, results, in, hydromagmatic, explosions, that, produce, abundant, ash, these, deposit, ash, cones, that, subsequently, can, become, cemented, into, tuff, cones, diamond, head, hawaii, is, an, example, of, a, tuff, cone, as, is, the, island, of, ka, ula, the, glassy, basaltic, ash, produced, in, such, eruptions, rapidly, alters, to, palagonite, as, part, of, the, process, of, lithification, although, conventional, mafic, volcanism, produce, little, ash, such, ash, as, is, formed, may, accumulate, locally, as, significant, deposits, an, example, is, the, pahala, ash, of, hawaii, island, which, locally, is, as, thick, as, 15, meters, 49, ft, these, deposits, also, rapidly, alter, to, palagonite, and, eventually, weather, to, laterite, basaltic, tuffs, are, also, found, in, skye, mull, antrim, and, other, places, where, paleogene, volcanic, rocks, are, found, in, scotland, derbyshire, and, ireland, among, the, carboniferous, strata, and, among, the, still, older, rocks, of, the, lake, district, the, southern, uplands, of, scotland, and, wales, they, are, black, dark, green, or, red, in, colour, vary, greatly, in, coarseness, some, being, full, of, round, spongy, bombs, a, foot, or, more, in, diameter, and, being, often, submarine, may, contain, shale, sandstone, grit, and, other, sedimentary, material, and, are, occasionally, fossiliferous, recent, basaltic, tuffs, are, found, in, iceland, the, faroe, islands, jan, mayen, sicily, the, hawaiian, islands, samoa, etc, when, weathered, they, are, filled, with, calcite, chlorite, serpentine, and, especially, where, the, lavas, contain, nepheline, or, leucite, are, often, rich, in, zeolites, such, as, analcite, prehnite, natrolite, scolecite, chabazite, heulandite, etc, ultramafic, tuffs, are, extremely, rare, their, characteristic, is, the, abundance, of, olivine, or, serpentine, and, the, scarcity, or, absence, of, feldspar, and, quartz, occurrences, of, ultramafic, tuff, include, surface, deposits, of, kimberlite, at, maars, in, the, diamond, fields, of, southern, africa, and, other, regions, the, principal, variety, of, kimberlite, is, a, dark, bluish, green, serpentine, rich, breccia, blue, ground, which, when, thoroughly, oxidized, and, weathered, becomes, a, friable, brown, or, yellow, mass, the, yellow, ground, these, breccias, were, emplaced, as, gas, solid, mixtures, and, are, typically, preserved, and, mined, in, diatremes, that, form, intrusive, pipe, like, structures, at, depth, some, kimberlite, breccias, grade, into, root, zones, of, dikes, made, of, unfragmented, rock, at, the, surface, ultramafic, tuffs, may, occur, in, maar, deposits, because, kimberlites, are, the, most, common, igneous, source, of, diamonds, the, transitions, from, maar, to, diatreme, to, root, zone, dikes, have, been, studied, in, detail, diatreme, facies, kimberlite, is, more, properly, called, an, ultramafic, breccia, rather, than, a, tuff, komatiite, tuffs, are, found, for, example, in, the, greenstone, belts, of, canada, and, south, africa, in, course, of, time, changes, other, than, weathering, may, overtake, tuff, deposits, sometimes, they, are, involved, in, folding, and, become, sheared, and, cleaved, many, of, the, green, slates, of, the, english, lake, district, are, finely, cleaved, ashes, in, charnwood, forest, also, the, tuffs, are, slaty, and, cleaved, the, green, color, is, due, to, the, large, development, of, chlorite, among, the, crystalline, schists, of, many, regions, green, beds, or, green, schists, occur, which, consist, of, quartz, hornblende, chlorite, or, biotite, iron, oxides, feldspar, etc, and, are, probably, recrystallized, or, metamorphosed, tuffs, they, often, accompany, masses, of, epidiorite, and, hornblende, schists, which, are, the, corresponding, lavas, and, sills, some, chlorite, schists, also, are, probably, altered, beds, of, volcanic, tuff, the, schalsteins, of, devon, and, germany, include, many, cleaved, and, partly, recrystallized, ash, beds, some, of, which, still, retain, their, fragmental, structure, though, their, lapilli, are, flattened, and, drawn, out, their, steam, cavities, are, usually, filled, with, calcite, but, sometimes, with, quartz, the, more, completely, altered, forms, of, these, rocks, are, platy, green, chloritic, schists, in, these, however, structures, indicating, their, original, volcanic, nature, only, sparingly, occur, these, are, intermediate, stages, between, cleaved, tuffs, and, crystalline, schists, the, primary, economic, value, of, tuff, is, as, a, building, material, in, the, ancient, world, tuff, s, relative, softness, meant, that, it, was, commonly, used, for, construction, where, it, was, available, tuff, is, common, in, italy, and, the, romans, used, it, for, many, buildings, and, bridges, for, example, the, whole, port, of, the, island, of, ventotene, still, in, use, was, carved, from, tuff, the, servian, wall, built, to, defend, the, city, of, rome, in, the, fourth, century, bc, is, also, built, almost, entirely, from, tuff, the, romans, also, cut, tuff, into, small, rectangular, stones, that, they, used, to, create, walls, in, a, pattern, known, as, opus, reticulatum, peperino, has, been, used, in, rome, and, naples, as, a, building, stone, is, a, trachyte, tuff, pozzolana, also, is, a, decomposed, tuff, but, of, basic, character, originally, obtained, near, naples, and, used, as, a, cement, but, this, name, is, now, applied, to, a, number, of, substances, not, always, of, identical, character, in, the, historical, architecture, of, naples, neapolitan, yellow, tuff, is, the, most, used, building, material, piperno, ignimbrite, tuff, was, also, used, widely, in, naples, and, campania, in, the, eifel, region, of, germany, a, trachytic, pumiceous, tuff, called, trass, has, been, extensively, worked, as, a, hydraulic, mortar, tuff, of, the, eifel, region, of, germany, has, been, widely, used, for, construction, of, railroad, stations, and, other, buildings, in, frankfurt, hamburg, and, other, large, cities, construction, using, the, rochlitz, porphyr, can, be, seen, in, the, mannerist, style, sculpted, portal, outside, the, chapel, entrance, in, colditz, castle, the, trade, name, rochlitz, porphyr, is, the, traditional, designation, for, a, dimension, stone, of, saxony, with, an, architectural, history, over, 1, 000, years, in, germany, the, quarries, are, located, near, rochlitz, yucca, mountain, nuclear, waste, repository, a, u, s, department, of, energy, terminal, storage, facility, for, spent, nuclear, reactor, and, other, radioactive, waste, is, in, tuff, and, ignimbrite, in, the, basin, and, range, province, in, nevada, in, napa, valley, and, sonoma, valley, california, areas, made, of, tuff, are, routinely, excavated, for, storage, of, wine, barrels, tuff, from, rano, raraku, was, used, by, the, rapa, nui, people, of, easter, island, to, make, the, vast, majority, of, their, famous, moai, statues, tuff, is, used, extensively, in, armenia, and, armenian, architecture, it, is, the, dominant, type, of, stone, used, in, construction, in, armenia, s, capital, yerevan, gyumri, armenia, s, second, largest, city, and, ani, the, country, s, medieval, capital, now, in, turkey, a, small, village, in, armenia, was, renamed, tufashen, literally, village, of, tuff, in, 1946, tuffs, are, deposited, geologically, instantaneously, and, often, over, a, large, region, this, makes, them, highly, useful, as, time, stratigraphic, markers, the, use, of, tuffs, and, other, tephra, deposits, in, this, manner, is, known, as, tephrochronology, and, is, particularly, useful, for, quaternary, chronostratigraphy, individual, tuff, beds, can, be, fingerprinted, by, their, chemical, composition, and, phenocryst, assemblages, absolute, ages, for, tuff, beds, can, be, determined, by, k, ar, ar, ar, or, carbon, 14, dating, zircon, grains, found, in, many, tuffs, are, highly, durable, and, can, survive, even, metamorphism, of, the, host, tuff, to, schist, allowing, absolute, ages, to, be, assigned, to, ancient, metamorphic, rocks, for, example, dating, of, zircons, in, a, metamorphosed, tuff, bed, in, the, pilar, formation, provided, some, of, the, first, evidence, for, the, picuris, orogeny, the, word, tuff, is, derived, from, the, italian, tufo
