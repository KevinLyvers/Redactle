in, chemistry, a, suspension, is, a, heterogeneous, mixture, of, a, fluid, that, contains, solid, particles, sufficiently, large, for, sedimentation, the, particles, may, be, visible, to, the, naked, eye, usually, must, be, larger, than, one, micrometer, and, will, eventually, settle, although, the, mixture, is, only, classified, as, a, suspension, when, and, while, the, particles, have, not, settled, out, a, suspension, is, a, heterogeneous, mixture, in, which, the, solid, particles, do, not, dissolve, but, get, suspended, throughout, the, bulk, of, the, solvent, left, floating, around, freely, in, the, medium, the, internal, phase, solid, is, dispersed, throughout, the, external, phase, fluid, through, mechanical, agitation, with, the, use, of, certain, excipients, or, suspending, agents, an, example, of, a, suspension, would, be, sand, in, water, the, suspended, particles, are, visible, under, a, microscope, and, will, settle, over, time, if, left, undisturbed, this, distinguishes, a, suspension, from, a, colloid, in, which, the, colloid, particles, are, smaller, and, do, not, settle, colloids, and, suspensions, are, different, from, solution, in, which, the, dissolved, substance, solute, does, not, exist, as, a, solid, and, solvent, and, solute, are, homogeneously, mixed, a, suspension, of, liquid, droplets, or, fine, solid, particles, in, a, gas, is, called, an, aerosol, in, the, atmosphere, the, suspended, particles, are, called, particulates, and, consist, of, fine, dust, and, soot, particles, sea, salt, biogenic, and, volcanogenic, sulfates, nitrates, and, cloud, droplets, suspensions, are, classified, on, the, basis, of, the, dispersed, phase, and, the, dispersion, medium, where, the, former, is, essentially, solid, while, the, latter, may, either, be, a, solid, a, liquid, or, a, gas, in, modern, chemical, process, industries, high, shear, mixing, technology, has, been, used, to, create, many, novel, suspensions, suspensions, are, unstable, from, a, thermodynamic, point, of, view, but, can, be, kinetically, stable, over, a, longer, period, of, time, which, in, turn, can, determine, a, suspension, s, shelf, life, this, time, span, needs, to, be, measured, in, order, to, provide, accurate, information, to, the, consumer, and, ensure, the, best, product, quality, dispersion, stability, refers, to, the, ability, of, a, dispersion, to, resist, change, in, its, properties, over, time, dispersion, of, solid, particles, in, a, liquid, note, definition, based, on, that, in, ref, multiple, light, scattering, coupled, with, vertical, scanning, is, the, most, widely, used, technique, to, monitor, the, dispersion, state, of, a, product, hence, identifying, and, quantifying, destabilization, phenomena, it, works, on, concentrated, dispersions, without, dilution, when, light, is, sent, through, the, sample, it, is, back, scattered, by, the, particles, the, backscattering, intensity, is, directly, proportional, to, the, size, and, volume, fraction, of, the, dispersed, phase, therefore, local, changes, in, concentration, sedimentation, and, global, changes, in, size, flocculation, aggregation, are, detected, and, monitored, of, primary, importance, in, the, analysis, of, stability, in, particle, suspensions, is, the, value, of, the, zeta, potential, exhibited, by, suspended, solids, this, parameter, indicates, the, magnitude, of, interparticle, electrostatic, repulsion, and, is, commonly, analyzed, to, determine, how, the, use, of, adsorbates, and, ph, modification, affect, particle, repulsion, and, suspension, stabilization, or, destabilization, the, kinetic, process, of, destabilisation, can, be, rather, long, up, to, several, months, or, even, years, for, some, products, and, it, is, often, required, for, the, formulator, to, use, further, accelerating, methods, in, order, to, reach, reasonable, development, time, for, new, product, design, thermal, methods, are, the, most, commonly, used, and, consists, in, increasing, temperature, to, accelerate, destabilisation, below, critical, temperatures, of, phase, and, degradation, temperature, affects, not, only, the, viscosity, but, also, interfacial, tension, in, the, case, of, non, ionic, surfactants, or, more, generally, interactions, forces, inside, the, system, storing, a, dispersion, at, high, temperatures, enables, simulation, of, real, life, conditions, for, a, product, e, g, tube, of, sunscreen, cream, in, a, car, in, the, summer, but, also, to, accelerate, destabilisation, processes, up, to, 200, times, including, vibration, centrifugation, and, agitation, are, sometimes, used, they, subject, the, product, to, different, forces, that, pushes, the, particles, film, drainage, however, some, emulsions, would, never, coalesce, in, normal, gravity, while, they, do, under, artificial, gravity, moreover, segregation, of, different, populations, of, particles, have, been, highlighted, when, using, centrifugation, and, vibration, common, examples, of, suspensions, include
