callisto, k, l, s, t, o, k, list, oh, or, jupiter, iv, is, the, second, largest, moon, of, jupiter, after, ganymede, in, the, solar, system, it, is, the, third, largest, moon, after, ganymede, and, saturn, s, largest, moon, titan, and, nearly, as, large, as, the, smallest, planet, mercury, callisto, is, with, a, diameter, of, 4, 821, km, roughly, a, third, larger, than, earth, s, moon, and, orbits, jupiter, on, average, at, a, distance, of, 1, 883, 000, km, which, is, about, six, times, further, out, than, the, moon, orbiting, earth, it, is, the, outermost, of, the, four, large, galilean, moons, of, jupiter, which, were, discovered, in, 1610, with, one, of, the, first, telescopes, being, visible, from, earth, with, common, binoculars, the, surface, of, callisto, is, the, oldest, and, most, heavily, cratered, in, the, solar, system, its, surface, is, completely, covered, with, impact, craters, it, does, not, show, any, signatures, of, subsurface, processes, such, as, plate, tectonics, or, volcanism, with, no, signs, that, geological, activity, in, general, has, ever, occurred, and, is, thought, to, have, evolved, predominantly, under, the, influence, of, impacts, prominent, surface, features, include, multi, ring, structures, variously, shaped, impact, craters, and, chains, of, craters, catenae, and, associated, scarps, ridges, and, deposits, at, a, small, scale, the, surface, is, varied, and, made, up, of, small, sparkly, frost, deposits, at, the, tips, of, high, spots, surrounded, by, a, low, lying, smooth, blanket, of, dark, material, this, is, thought, to, result, from, the, sublimation, driven, degradation, of, small, landforms, which, is, supported, by, the, general, deficit, of, small, impact, craters, and, the, presence, of, numerous, small, knobs, considered, to, be, their, remnants, the, absolute, ages, of, the, landforms, are, not, known, callisto, is, composed, of, approximately, equal, amounts, of, rock, and, ice, with, a, density, of, about, 1, 83, g, cm, 3, the, lowest, density, and, surface, gravity, of, jupiter, s, major, moons, compounds, detected, spectroscopically, on, the, surface, include, water, ice, carbon, dioxide, silicates, and, organic, compounds, investigation, by, the, galileo, spacecraft, revealed, that, callisto, may, have, a, small, silicate, core, and, possibly, a, subsurface, ocean, of, liquid, water, at, depths, greater, than, 100, km, it, is, not, in, an, orbital, resonance, like, the, three, other, galilean, satellites, io, europa, and, ganymede, and, is, thus, not, appreciably, tidally, heated, callisto, s, rotation, is, tidally, locked, to, its, orbit, around, jupiter, so, that, it, always, faces, the, same, direction, making, jupiter, appear, to, hang, directly, overhead, over, its, near, side, it, is, less, affected, by, jupiter, s, magnetosphere, than, the, other, inner, satellites, because, of, its, more, remote, orbit, located, just, outside, jupiter, s, main, radiation, belt, callisto, is, surrounded, by, an, extremely, thin, atmosphere, composed, of, carbon, dioxide, and, probably, molecular, oxygen, as, well, as, by, a, rather, intense, ionosphere, callisto, is, thought, to, have, formed, by, slow, accretion, from, the, disk, of, the, gas, and, dust, that, surrounded, jupiter, after, its, formation, callisto, s, gradual, accretion, and, the, lack, of, tidal, heating, meant, that, not, enough, heat, was, available, for, rapid, differentiation, the, slow, convection, in, the, interior, of, callisto, which, commenced, soon, after, formation, led, to, partial, differentiation, and, possibly, to, the, formation, of, a, subsurface, ocean, at, a, depth, of, 100, 150, km, and, a, small, rocky, core, the, likely, presence, of, an, ocean, within, callisto, leaves, open, the, possibility, that, it, could, harbor, life, however, conditions, are, thought, to, be, less, favorable, than, on, nearby, europa, various, space, probes, from, pioneers, 10, and, 11, to, galileo, and, cassini, have, studied, callisto, because, of, its, low, radiation, levels, callisto, has, long, been, considered, the, most, suitable, to, base, possible, future, crewed, missions, on, to, study, the, jovian, system, callisto, was, discovered, independently, by, simon, marius, and, galileo, galilei, in, 1610, along, with, the, three, other, large, jovian, moons, ganymede, io, and, europa, callisto, like, all, of, jupiter, s, moons, is, named, after, one, of, zeus, s, many, lovers, or, other, sexual, partners, in, greek, mythology, callisto, was, a, nymph, or, according, to, some, sources, the, daughter, of, lycaon, who, was, associated, with, the, goddess, of, the, hunt, artemis, the, name, was, suggested, by, simon, marius, soon, after, callisto, s, discovery, marius, attributed, the, suggestion, to, johannes, kepler, jupiter, is, much, blamed, by, the, poets, on, account, of, his, irregular, loves, three, maidens, are, especially, mentioned, as, having, been, clandestinely, courted, by, jupiter, with, success, io, daughter, of, the, river, inachus, callisto, of, lycaon, europa, of, agenor, then, there, was, ganymede, the, handsome, son, of, king, tros, whom, jupiter, having, taken, the, form, of, an, eagle, transported, to, heaven, on, his, back, as, poets, fabulously, tell, i, think, therefore, that, i, shall, not, have, done, amiss, if, the, first, is, called, by, me, io, the, second, europa, the, third, on, account, of, its, majesty, of, light, ganymede, the, fourth, callisto, however, the, names, of, the, galilean, satellites, fell, into, disfavor, for, a, considerable, time, and, were, not, revived, in, common, use, until, the, mid, 20th, century, in, much, of, the, earlier, astronomical, literature, callisto, is, referred, to, by, its, roman, numeral, designation, a, system, introduced, by, galileo, as, jupiter, iv, or, as, the, fourth, satellite, of, jupiter, there, s, no, established, english, adjectival, form, of, the, name, the, adjectival, form, of, greek, kallist, i, is, kallist, i, os, from, which, one, might, expect, latin, callist, ius, and, english, callist, ian, with, 5, syllables, parallel, to, sapph, ian, 4, syllables, for, sapph, i, and, let, ian, for, l, t, i, however, the, iota, subscript, is, often, omitted, from, such, greek, names, cf, in, an, from, n, i, and, arg, an, from, arg, i, and, indeed, the, analogous, form, callistoan, is, found, in, virgil, a, second, oblique, stem, appears, in, latin, callist, n, but, the, corresponding, callistonian, has, rarely, appeared, in, english, one, also, sees, ad, hoc, forms, such, as, callistan, callistian, and, callistean, callisto, is, the, outermost, of, the, four, galilean, moons, of, jupiter, it, orbits, at, a, distance, of, approximately, 1, 880, 000, km, 26, 3, times, the, 71, 492, km, radius, of, jupiter, itself, this, is, significantly, larger, than, the, orbital, radius, 1, 070, 000, km, of, the, next, closest, galilean, satellite, ganymede, as, a, result, of, this, relatively, distant, orbit, callisto, does, not, participate, in, mean, motion, resonance, in, which, the, three, inner, galilean, satellites, are, locked, and, probably, never, has, callisto, is, expected, to, be, captured, into, the, resonance, in, about, 1, 5, billion, years, completing, the, 1, 2, 4, 8, chain, like, most, other, regular, planetary, moons, callisto, s, rotation, is, locked, to, be, synchronous, with, its, orbit, the, length, of, callisto, s, day, simultaneously, its, orbital, period, is, about, 16, 7, earth, days, its, orbit, is, very, slightly, eccentric, and, inclined, to, the, jovian, equator, with, the, eccentricity, and, inclination, changing, quasi, periodically, due, to, solar, and, planetary, gravitational, perturbations, on, a, timescale, of, centuries, the, ranges, of, change, are, 0, 0072, 0, 0076, and, 0, 20, 0, 60, respectively, these, orbital, variations, cause, the, axial, tilt, the, angle, between, the, rotational, and, orbital, axes, to, vary, between, 0, 4, and, 1, 6, the, dynamical, isolation, of, callisto, means, that, it, has, never, been, appreciably, tidally, heated, which, has, important, consequences, for, its, internal, structure, and, evolution, its, distance, from, jupiter, also, means, that, the, charged, particle, flux, from, jupiter, s, magnetosphere, at, its, surface, is, relatively, low, about, 300, times, lower, than, for, example, that, at, europa, hence, unlike, the, other, galilean, moons, charged, particle, irradiation, has, had, a, relatively, minor, effect, on, callisto, s, surface, the, radiation, level, at, callisto, s, surface, is, equivalent, to, a, dose, of, about, 0, 01, rem, 0, 1, msv, per, day, which, is, just, over, ten, times, higher, than, earth, s, average, background, radiation, but, less, than, in, low, earth, orbit, or, on, mars, the, average, density, of, callisto, 1, 83, g, cm, 3, suggests, a, composition, of, approximately, equal, parts, of, rocky, material, and, water, ice, with, some, additional, volatile, ices, such, as, ammonia, the, mass, fraction, of, ices, is, 49, 55, the, exact, composition, of, callisto, s, rock, component, is, not, known, but, is, probably, close, to, the, composition, of, l, ll, type, ordinary, chondrites, which, are, characterized, by, less, total, iron, less, metallic, iron, and, more, iron, oxide, than, h, chondrites, the, weight, ratio, of, iron, to, silicon, is, 0, 9, 1, 3, in, callisto, whereas, the, solar, ratio, is, around, 1, 8, callisto, s, surface, has, an, albedo, of, about, 20, its, surface, composition, is, thought, to, be, broadly, similar, to, its, composition, as, a, whole, near, infrared, spectroscopy, has, revealed, the, presence, of, water, ice, absorption, bands, at, wavelengths, of, 1, 04, 1, 25, 1, 5, 2, 0, and, 3, 0, micrometers, water, ice, seems, to, be, ubiquitous, on, the, surface, of, callisto, with, a, mass, fraction, of, 25, 50, the, analysis, of, high, resolution, near, infrared, and, uv, spectra, obtained, by, the, galileo, spacecraft, and, from, the, ground, has, revealed, various, non, ice, materials, magnesium, and, iron, bearing, hydrated, silicates, carbon, dioxide, sulfur, dioxide, and, possibly, ammonia, and, various, organic, compounds, spectral, data, indicate, that, callisto, s, surface, is, extremely, heterogeneous, at, the, small, scale, small, bright, patches, of, pure, water, ice, are, intermixed, with, patches, of, a, rock, ice, mixture, and, extended, dark, areas, made, of, a, non, ice, material, the, callistoan, surface, is, asymmetric, the, leading, hemisphere, is, darker, than, the, trailing, one, this, is, different, from, other, galilean, satellites, where, the, reverse, is, true, the, trailing, hemisphere, of, callisto, appears, to, be, enriched, in, carbon, dioxide, whereas, the, leading, hemisphere, has, more, sulfur, dioxide, many, fresh, impact, craters, like, lofn, also, show, enrichment, in, carbon, dioxide, overall, the, chemical, composition, of, the, surface, especially, in, the, dark, areas, may, be, close, to, that, seen, on, d, type, asteroids, whose, surfaces, are, made, of, carbonaceous, material, callisto, s, battered, surface, lies, on, top, of, a, cold, stiff, and, icy, lithosphere, that, is, between, 80, and, 150, km, thick, a, salty, ocean, 150, 200, km, deep, may, lie, beneath, the, crust, indicated, by, studies, of, the, magnetic, fields, around, jupiter, and, its, moons, it, was, found, that, callisto, responds, to, jupiter, s, varying, background, magnetic, field, like, a, perfectly, conducting, sphere, that, is, the, field, cannot, penetrate, inside, callisto, suggesting, a, layer, of, highly, conductive, fluid, within, it, with, a, thickness, of, at, least, 10, km, the, existence, of, an, ocean, is, more, likely, if, water, contains, a, small, amount, of, ammonia, or, other, antifreeze, up, to, 5, by, weight, in, this, case, the, water, ice, layer, can, be, as, thick, as, 250, 300, km, failing, an, ocean, the, icy, lithosphere, may, be, somewhat, thicker, up, to, about, 300, km, beneath, the, lithosphere, and, putative, ocean, callisto, s, interior, appears, to, be, neither, entirely, uniform, nor, particularly, variable, galileo, orbiter, data, especially, the, dimensionless, moment, of, inertia, 0, 3549, 0, 0042, determined, during, close, flybys, suggest, that, if, callisto, is, in, hydrostatic, equilibrium, its, interior, is, composed, of, compressed, rocks, and, ices, with, the, amount, of, rock, increasing, with, depth, due, to, partial, settling, of, its, constituents, in, other, words, callisto, may, be, only, partially, differentiated, the, density, and, moment, of, inertia, for, an, equilibrium, callisto, are, compatible, with, the, existence, of, a, small, silicate, core, in, the, center, of, callisto, the, radius, of, any, such, core, cannot, exceed, 600, km, and, the, density, may, lie, between, 3, 1, and, 3, 6, g, cm, 3, in, this, case, callisto, s, interior, would, be, in, stark, contrast, to, that, of, ganymede, which, appears, to, be, fully, differentiated, however, a, 2011, reanalysis, of, galileo, data, suggests, that, callisto, is, not, in, hydrostatic, equilibrium, in, that, case, the, gravity, data, may, be, more, consistent, with, a, more, thoroughly, differentiated, callisto, with, a, hydrated, silicate, core, the, ancient, surface, of, callisto, is, one, of, the, most, heavily, cratered, in, the, solar, system, in, fact, the, crater, density, is, close, to, saturation, any, new, crater, will, tend, to, erase, an, older, one, the, large, scale, geology, is, relatively, simple, on, callisto, there, are, no, large, mountains, volcanoes, or, other, endogenic, tectonic, features, the, impact, craters, and, multi, ring, structures, together, with, associated, fractures, scarps, and, deposits, are, the, only, large, features, to, be, found, on, the, surface, callisto, s, surface, can, be, divided, into, several, geologically, different, parts, cratered, plains, light, plains, bright, and, dark, smooth, plains, and, various, units, associated, with, particular, multi, ring, structures, and, impact, craters, the, cratered, plains, make, up, most, of, the, surface, area, and, represent, the, ancient, lithosphere, a, mixture, of, ice, and, rocky, material, the, light, plains, include, bright, impact, craters, like, burr, and, lofn, as, well, as, the, effaced, remnants, of, old, large, craters, called, palimpsests, the, central, parts, of, multi, ring, structures, and, isolated, patches, in, the, cratered, plains, these, light, plains, are, thought, to, be, icy, impact, deposits, the, bright, smooth, plains, make, up, a, small, fraction, of, callisto, s, surface, and, are, found, in, the, ridge, and, trough, zones, of, the, valhalla, and, asgard, formations, and, as, isolated, spots, in, the, cratered, plains, they, were, thought, to, be, connected, with, endogenic, activity, but, the, high, resolution, galileo, images, showed, that, the, bright, smooth, plains, correlate, with, heavily, fractured, and, knobby, terrain, and, do, not, show, any, signs, of, resurfacing, the, galileo, images, also, revealed, small, dark, smooth, areas, with, overall, coverage, less, than, 10, 000, km, 2, which, appear, to, embay, the, surrounding, terrain, they, are, possible, cryovolcanic, deposits, both, the, light, and, the, various, smooth, plains, are, somewhat, younger, and, less, cratered, than, the, background, cratered, plains, impact, crater, diameters, seen, range, from, 0, 1, km, a, limit, defined, by, the, imaging, resolution, to, over, 100, km, not, counting, the, multi, ring, structures, small, craters, with, diameters, less, than, 5, km, have, simple, bowl, or, flat, floored, shapes, those, 5, 40, km, across, usually, have, a, central, peak, larger, impact, features, with, diameters, in, the, range, 25, 100, km, have, central, pits, instead, of, peaks, such, as, tindr, crater, the, largest, craters, with, diameters, over, 60, km, can, have, central, domes, which, are, thought, to, result, from, central, tectonic, uplift, after, an, impact, examples, include, doh, and, h, r, craters, a, small, number, of, very, large, more, than, 100, km, in, diameter, and, bright, impact, craters, show, anomalous, dome, geometry, these, are, unusually, shallow, and, may, be, a, transitional, landform, to, the, multi, ring, structures, as, with, the, lofn, impact, feature, callisto, s, craters, are, generally, shallower, than, those, on, the, moon, the, largest, impact, features, on, callisto, s, surface, are, multi, ring, basins, two, are, enormous, valhalla, is, the, largest, with, a, bright, central, region, 600, km, in, diameter, and, rings, extending, as, far, as, 1, 800, km, from, the, center, see, figure, the, second, largest, is, asgard, measuring, about, 1, 600, km, in, diameter, multi, ring, structures, probably, originated, as, a, result, of, a, post, impact, concentric, fracturing, of, the, lithosphere, lying, on, a, layer, of, soft, or, liquid, material, possibly, an, ocean, the, catenae, for, example, gomul, catena, are, long, chains, of, impact, craters, lined, up, in, straight, lines, across, the, surface, they, were, probably, created, by, objects, that, were, tidally, disrupted, as, they, passed, close, to, jupiter, prior, to, the, impact, on, callisto, or, by, very, oblique, impacts, a, historical, example, of, a, disruption, was, comet, shoemaker, levy, 9, as, mentioned, above, small, patches, of, pure, water, ice, with, an, albedo, as, high, as, 80, are, found, on, the, surface, of, callisto, surrounded, by, much, darker, material, high, resolution, galileo, images, showed, the, bright, patches, to, be, predominately, located, on, elevated, surface, features, crater, rims, scarps, ridges, and, knobs, they, are, likely, to, be, thin, water, frost, deposits, dark, material, usually, lies, in, the, lowlands, surrounding, and, mantling, bright, features, and, appears, to, be, smooth, it, often, forms, patches, up, to, 5, km, across, within, the, crater, floors, and, in, the, intercrater, depressions, on, a, sub, kilometer, scale, the, surface, of, callisto, is, more, degraded, than, the, surfaces, of, other, icy, galilean, moons, typically, there, is, a, deficit, of, small, impact, craters, with, diameters, less, than, 1, km, as, compared, with, for, instance, the, dark, plains, on, ganymede, instead, of, small, craters, the, almost, ubiquitous, surface, features, are, small, knobs, and, pits, the, knobs, are, thought, to, represent, remnants, of, crater, rims, degraded, by, an, as, yet, uncertain, process, the, most, likely, candidate, process, is, the, slow, sublimation, of, ice, which, is, enabled, by, a, temperature, of, up, to, 165, k, reached, at, a, subsolar, point, such, sublimation, of, water, or, other, volatiles, from, the, dirty, ice, that, is, the, bedrock, causes, its, decomposition, the, non, ice, remnants, form, debris, avalanches, descending, from, the, slopes, of, the, crater, walls, such, avalanches, are, often, observed, near, and, inside, impact, craters, and, termed, debris, aprons, sometimes, crater, walls, are, cut, by, sinuous, valley, like, incisions, called, gullies, which, resemble, certain, martian, surface, features, in, the, ice, sublimation, hypothesis, the, low, lying, dark, material, is, interpreted, as, a, blanket, of, primarily, non, ice, debris, which, originated, from, the, degraded, rims, of, craters, and, has, covered, a, predominantly, icy, bedrock, the, relative, ages, of, the, different, surface, units, on, callisto, can, be, determined, from, the, density, of, impact, craters, on, them, the, older, the, surface, the, denser, the, crater, population, absolute, dating, has, not, been, carried, out, but, based, on, theoretical, considerations, the, cratered, plains, are, thought, to, be, 4, 5, billion, years, old, dating, back, almost, to, the, formation, of, the, solar, system, the, ages, of, multi, ring, structures, and, impact, craters, depend, on, chosen, background, cratering, rates, and, are, estimated, by, different, authors, to, vary, between, 1, and, 4, billion, years, callisto, has, a, very, tenuous, atmosphere, composed, of, carbon, dioxide, and, probably, oxygen, it, was, detected, by, the, galileo, near, infrared, mapping, spectrometer, nims, from, its, absorption, feature, near, the, wavelength, 4, 2, micrometers, the, surface, pressure, is, estimated, to, be, 7, 5, pico, bar, 0, 75, pa, and, particle, density, 4, 10, 8, cm, 3, because, such, a, thin, atmosphere, would, be, lost, in, only, about, four, years, see, atmospheric, escape, it, must, be, constantly, replenished, possibly, by, slow, sublimation, of, carbon, dioxide, ice, from, callisto, s, icy, crust, which, would, be, compatible, with, the, sublimation, degradation, hypothesis, for, the, formation, of, the, surface, knobs, callisto, s, ionosphere, was, first, detected, during, galileo, flybys, its, high, electron, density, of, 7, 17, 10, 4, cm, 3, cannot, be, explained, by, the, photoionization, of, the, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, alone, hence, it, is, suspected, that, the, atmosphere, of, callisto, is, actually, dominated, by, molecular, oxygen, in, amounts, 10, 100, times, greater, than, co, 2, however, oxygen, has, not, yet, been, directly, detected, in, the, atmosphere, of, callisto, observations, with, the, hubble, space, telescope, hst, placed, an, upper, limit, on, its, possible, concentration, in, the, atmosphere, based, on, lack, of, detection, which, is, still, compatible, with, the, ionospheric, measurements, at, the, same, time, hst, was, able, to, detect, condensed, oxygen, trapped, on, the, surface, of, callisto, atomic, hydrogen, has, also, been, detected, in, callisto, s, atmosphere, via, recent, analysis, of, 2001, hubble, space, telescope, data, spectral, images, taken, on, 15, and, 24, december, 2001, were, re, examined, revealing, a, faint, signal, of, scattered, light, that, indicates, a, hydrogen, corona, the, observed, brightness, from, the, scattered, sunlight, in, callisto, s, hydrogen, corona, is, approximately, two, times, larger, when, the, leading, hemisphere, is, observed, this, asymmetry, may, originate, from, a, different, hydrogen, abundance, in, both, the, leading, and, trailing, hemispheres, however, this, hemispheric, difference, in, callisto, s, hydrogen, corona, brightness, is, likely, to, originate, from, the, extinction, of, the, signal, in, earth, s, geocorona, which, is, greater, when, the, trailing, hemisphere, is, observed, callisto, s, atmosphere, has, been, modelled, to, gain, better, understanding, of, impact, of, collisional, molecular, interactions, researchers, used, a, kinetic, method, to, model, collisions, between, the, constituent, elements, of, callisto, s, atmosphere, carbon, dioxide, molecular, oxygen, and, molecular, hydrogen, the, modeling, took, into, account, the, thermal, desorption, of, these, compounds, due, to, solar, exposure, and, the, resulting, variations, in, temperature, on, the, surface, the, simulation, showed, that, the, density, of, callisto, s, atmosphere, could, be, explained, by, the, trapping, of, hydrogen, by, the, heavier, gases, carbon, dioxide, and, oxygen, the, model, shows, how, kinetic, interactions, between, molecules, affect, the, atmosphere, although, it, has, limitations, in, terms, of, variables, considered, the, simulated, densities, correlate, with, expected, thresholds, for, experimental, detection, the, partial, differentiation, of, callisto, inferred, e, g, from, moment, of, inertia, measurements, means, that, it, has, never, been, heated, enough, to, melt, its, ice, component, therefore, the, most, favorable, model, of, its, formation, is, a, slow, accretion, in, the, low, density, jovian, subnebula, a, disk, of, the, gas, and, dust, that, existed, around, jupiter, after, its, formation, such, a, prolonged, accretion, stage, would, allow, cooling, to, largely, keep, up, with, the, heat, accumulation, caused, by, impacts, radioactive, decay, and, contraction, thereby, preventing, melting, and, fast, differentiation, the, allowable, timescale, for, the, formation, of, callisto, lies, then, in, the, range, 0, 1, million, 10, million, years, the, further, evolution, of, callisto, after, accretion, was, determined, by, the, balance, of, the, radioactive, heating, cooling, through, thermal, conduction, near, the, surface, and, solid, state, or, subsolidus, convection, in, the, interior, details, of, the, subsolidus, convection, in, the, ice, is, the, main, source, of, uncertainty, in, the, models, of, all, icy, moons, it, is, known, to, develop, when, the, temperature, is, sufficiently, close, to, the, melting, point, due, to, the, temperature, dependence, of, ice, viscosity, subsolidus, convection, in, icy, bodies, is, a, slow, process, with, ice, motions, of, the, order, of, 1, centimeter, per, year, but, is, in, fact, a, very, effective, cooling, mechanism, on, long, timescales, it, is, thought, to, proceed, in, the, so, called, stagnant, lid, regime, where, a, stiff, cold, outer, layer, of, callisto, conducts, heat, without, convection, whereas, the, ice, beneath, it, convects, in, the, subsolidus, regime, for, callisto, the, outer, conductive, layer, corresponds, to, the, cold, and, rigid, lithosphere, with, a, thickness, of, about, 100, km, its, presence, would, explain, the, lack, of, any, signs, of, the, endogenic, activity, on, the, callistoan, surface, the, convection, in, the, interior, parts, of, callisto, may, be, layered, because, under, the, high, pressures, found, there, water, ice, exists, in, different, crystalline, phases, beginning, from, the, ice, i, on, the, surface, to, ice, vii, in, the, center, the, early, onset, of, subsolidus, convection, in, the, callistoan, interior, could, have, prevented, large, scale, ice, melting, and, any, resulting, differentiation, that, would, have, otherwise, formed, a, large, rocky, core, and, icy, mantle, due, to, the, convection, process, however, very, slow, and, partial, separation, and, differentiation, of, rocks, and, ices, inside, callisto, has, been, proceeding, on, timescales, of, billions, of, years, and, may, be, continuing, to, this, day, the, current, understanding, of, the, evolution, of, callisto, allows, for, the, existence, of, a, layer, or, ocean, of, liquid, water, in, its, interior, this, is, connected, with, the, anomalous, behavior, of, ice, i, phase, s, melting, temperature, which, decreases, with, pressure, achieving, temperatures, as, low, as, 251, k, at, 2, 070, bar, 207, mpa, in, all, realistic, models, of, callisto, the, temperature, in, the, layer, between, 100, and, 200, km, in, depth, is, very, close, to, or, exceeds, slightly, this, anomalous, melting, temperature, the, presence, of, even, small, amounts, of, ammonia, about, 1, 2, by, weight, almost, guarantees, the, liquid, s, existence, because, ammonia, would, lower, the, melting, temperature, even, further, although, callisto, is, very, similar, in, bulk, properties, to, ganymede, it, apparently, had, a, much, simpler, geological, history, the, surface, appears, to, have, been, shaped, mainly, by, impacts, and, other, exogenic, forces, unlike, neighboring, ganymede, with, its, grooved, terrain, there, is, little, evidence, of, tectonic, activity, explanations, that, have, been, proposed, for, the, contrasts, in, internal, heating, and, consequent, differentiation, and, geologic, activity, between, callisto, and, ganymede, include, differences, in, formation, conditions, the, greater, tidal, heating, experienced, by, ganymede, and, the, more, numerous, and, energetic, impacts, that, would, have, been, suffered, by, ganymede, during, the, late, heavy, bombardment, the, relatively, simple, geological, history, of, callisto, provides, planetary, scientists, with, a, reference, point, for, comparison, with, other, more, active, and, complex, worlds, it, is, speculated, that, there, could, be, life, in, callisto, s, subsurface, ocean, like, europa, and, ganymede, as, well, as, saturn, s, moons, enceladus, dione, and, titan, and, neptune, s, moon, triton, a, possible, subsurface, ocean, might, be, composed, of, salt, water, it, is, possible, that, halophiles, could, thrive, in, the, ocean, as, with, europa, and, ganymede, the, idea, has, been, raised, that, habitable, conditions, and, even, extraterrestrial, microbial, life, may, exist, in, the, salty, ocean, under, the, callistoan, surface, however, the, environmental, conditions, necessary, for, life, appear, to, be, less, favorable, on, callisto, than, on, europa, the, principal, reasons, are, the, lack, of, contact, with, rocky, material, and, the, lower, heat, flux, from, the, interior, of, callisto, callisto, s, ocean, is, heated, only, by, radioactive, decay, while, europa, s, is, also, heated, by, tidal, energy, as, it, is, much, closer, to, jupiter, it, is, thought, that, of, all, of, jupiter, s, moons, europa, has, the, greatest, chance, of, supporting, microbial, life, the, pioneer, 10, and, pioneer, 11, jupiter, encounters, in, the, early, 1970s, contributed, little, new, information, about, callisto, in, comparison, with, what, was, already, known, from, earth, based, observations, the, real, breakthrough, happened, later, with, the, voyager, 1, and, voyager, 2, flybys, in, 1979, they, imaged, more, than, half, of, the, callistoan, surface, with, a, resolution, of, 1, 2, km, and, precisely, measured, its, temperature, mass, and, shape, a, second, round, of, exploration, lasted, from, 1994, to, 2003, when, the, galileo, spacecraft, had, eight, close, encounters, with, callisto, the, last, flyby, during, the, c30, orbit, in, 2001, came, as, close, as, 138, km, to, the, surface, the, galileo, orbiter, completed, the, global, imaging, of, the, surface, and, delivered, a, number, of, pictures, with, a, resolution, as, high, as, 15, meters, of, selected, areas, of, callisto, in, 2000, the, cassini, spacecraft, en, route, to, saturn, acquired, high, quality, infrared, spectra, of, the, galilean, satellites, including, callisto, in, february, march, 2007, the, new, horizons, probe, on, its, way, to, pluto, obtained, new, images, and, spectra, of, callisto, callisto, will, be, visited, by, three, spacecraft, in, the, near, future, the, european, space, agency, s, jupiter, icy, moons, explorer, juice, which, launched, on, 14, april, 2023, will, perform, 21, close, flybys, of, callisto, between, 2031, and, 2034, nasa, s, europa, clipper, which, is, scheduled, to, launch, in, october, 2024, will, conduct, nine, close, flybys, of, callisto, beginning, in, 2030, china, s, cnsa, tianwen, 4, is, planned, to, launch, to, jupiter, around, 2030, before, entering, orbit, around, callisto, formerly, proposed, for, a, launch, in, 2020, the, europa, jupiter, system, mission, ejsm, was, a, joint, nasa, esa, proposal, for, exploration, of, jupiter, s, moons, in, february, 2009, it, was, announced, that, esa, nasa, had, given, this, mission, priority, ahead, of, the, titan, saturn, system, mission, at, the, time, esa, s, contribution, still, faced, funding, competition, from, other, esa, projects, ejsm, consisted, of, the, nasa, led, jupiter, europa, orbiter, the, esa, led, jupiter, ganymede, orbiter, and, possibly, a, jaxa, led, jupiter, magnetospheric, orbiter, in, 2003, nasa, conducted, a, conceptual, study, called, human, outer, planets, exploration, hope, regarding, the, future, human, exploration, of, the, outer, solar, system, the, target, chosen, to, consider, in, detail, was, callisto, the, study, proposed, a, possible, surface, base, on, callisto, that, would, produce, rocket, propellant, for, further, exploration, of, the, solar, system, advantages, of, a, base, on, callisto, include, low, radiation, due, to, its, distance, from, jupiter, and, geological, stability, such, a, base, could, facilitate, remote, exploration, of, europa, or, be, an, ideal, location, for, a, jovian, system, waystation, servicing, spacecraft, heading, farther, into, the, outer, solar, system, using, a, gravity, assist, from, a, close, flyby, of, jupiter, after, departing, callisto, in, december, 2003, nasa, reported, that, a, crewed, mission, to, callisto, might, be, possible, in, the, 2040s, solar, system, local, interstellar, cloud, local, bubble, gould, belt, orion,
