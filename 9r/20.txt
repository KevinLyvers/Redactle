the, imperial, system, of, units, imperial, system, or, imperial, units, also, known, as, british, imperial, or, exchequer, standards, of, 1826, is, the, system, of, units, first, defined, in, the, british, weights, and, measures, act, 1824, and, continued, to, be, developed, through, a, series, of, weights, and, measures, acts, and, amendments, the, imperial, system, developed, from, earlier, english, units, as, did, the, related, but, differing, system, of, customary, units, of, the, united, states, the, imperial, units, replaced, the, winchester, standards, which, were, in, effect, from, 1588, to, 1825, the, system, came, into, official, use, across, the, british, empire, in, 1826, by, the, late, 20th, century, most, nations, of, the, former, empire, had, officially, adopted, the, metric, system, as, their, main, system, of, measurement, but, imperial, units, are, still, used, alongside, metric, units, in, the, united, kingdom, and, in, some, other, parts, of, the, former, empire, notably, canada, the, modern, uk, legislation, defining, the, imperial, system, of, units, is, given, in, the, weights, and, measures, act, 1985, as, amended, the, weights, and, measures, act, 1824, was, initially, scheduled, to, go, into, effect, on, 1, may, 1825, the, weights, and, measures, act, 1825, pushed, back, the, date, to, 1, january, 1826, the, 1824, act, allowed, the, continued, use, of, pre, imperial, units, provided, that, they, were, customary, widely, known, and, clearly, marked, with, imperial, equivalents, apothecaries, units, are, not, mentioned, in, the, acts, of, 1824, and, 1825, at, the, time, apothecaries, weights, and, measures, were, regulated, in, england, wales, and, berwick, upon, tweed, by, the, london, college, of, physicians, and, in, ireland, by, the, dublin, college, of, physicians, in, scotland, apothecaries, units, were, unofficially, regulated, by, the, edinburgh, college, of, physicians, the, three, colleges, published, at, infrequent, intervals, pharmacopoeias, the, london, and, dublin, editions, having, the, force, of, law, imperial, apothecaries, measures, based, on, the, imperial, pint, of, 20, fluid, ounces, were, introduced, by, the, publication, of, the, london, pharmacopoeia, of, 1836, the, edinburgh, pharmacopoeia, of, 1839, and, the, dublin, pharmacopoeia, of, 1850, the, medical, act, 1858, transferred, to, the, crown, the, right, to, publish, the, official, pharmacopoeia, and, to, regulate, apothecaries, weights, and, measures, metric, equivalents, in, this, article, usually, assume, the, latest, official, definition, before, this, date, the, most, precise, measurement, of, the, imperial, standard, yard, was, 0, 914, 398, 415, metres, abbreviation, of, thousandth, of, an, inch, also, known, as, mil, the, weights, and, measures, act, 1824, invalidated, the, various, different, gallons, in, use, in, the, british, empire, declaring, them, to, be, replaced, by, the, statute, gallon, which, became, known, as, the, imperial, gallon, a, unit, close, in, volume, to, the, ale, gallon, the, 1824, act, defined, as, the, volume, of, a, gallon, to, be, that, of, 10, pounds, 4, 54, kg, of, distilled, water, weighed, in, air, with, brass, weights, with, the, barometer, standing, at, 30, inches, of, mercury, 102, kpa, at, a, temperature, of, 62, f, 17, c, the, 1824, act, went, on, to, give, this, volume, as, 277, 274, cubic, inches, 4, 54371, litres, the, weights, and, measures, act, 1963, refined, this, definition, to, be, the, volume, of, 10, pounds, of, distilled, water, of, density, 0, 998, 859, g, ml, weighed, in, air, of, density, 0, 001, 217, g, ml, against, weights, of, density, 8, 136, g, ml, which, works, out, to, 4, 546, 092, l, the, weights, and, measures, act, 1985, defined, a, gallon, to, be, exactly, 4, 546, 09, l, approximately, 277, 4194, cu, in, these, measurements, were, in, use, from, 1826, when, the, new, imperial, gallon, was, defined, for, pharmaceutical, purposes, they, were, replaced, by, the, metric, system, in, the, united, kingdom, on, 1, january, 1971, in, the, us, though, no, longer, recommended, the, apothecaries, system, is, still, used, occasionally, in, medicine, especially, in, prescriptions, for, older, medications, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, the, uk, used, three, different, systems, for, mass, and, weight, the, distinction, between, mass, and, weight, is, not, always, clearly, drawn, strictly, a, pound, is, a, unit, of, mass, but, it, is, commonly, referred, to, as, a, weight, when, a, distinction, is, necessary, the, term, pound, force, may, refer, to, a, unit, of, force, rather, than, mass, the, troy, pound, 373, 241, 7216, g, was, made, the, primary, unit, of, mass, by, the, weights, and, measures, act, 1824, and, its, use, was, abolished, in, the, uk, on, 1, january, 1879, with, only, the, troy, ounce, 31, 103, 4768, g, and, its, decimal, subdivisions, retained, the, weights, and, measures, act, 1855, made, the, avoirdupois, pound, the, primary, unit, of, mass, in, all, the, systems, the, fundamental, unit, is, the, pound, and, all, other, units, are, defined, as, fractions, or, multiples, of, it, the, 1824, act, of, parliament, defined, the, yard, and, pound, by, reference, to, the, prototype, standards, and, it, also, defined, the, values, of, certain, physical, constants, to, make, provision, for, re, creation, of, the, standards, if, they, were, to, be, damaged, for, the, yard, the, length, of, a, pendulum, beating, seconds, at, the, latitude, of, greenwich, at, mean, sea, level, in, vacuo, was, defined, as, 39, 013, 93, inches, for, the, pound, the, mass, of, a, cubic, inch, of, distilled, water, at, an, atmospheric, pressure, of, 30, inches, of, mercury, and, a, temperature, of, 62, fahrenheit, was, defined, as, 252, 458, grains, with, there, being, 7, 000, grains, per, pound, following, the, destruction, of, the, original, prototypes, in, the, 1834, houses, of, parliament, fire, it, proved, impossible, to, recreate, the, standards, from, these, definitions, and, a, new, weights, and, measures, act, 1855, was, passed, which, permitted, the, recreation, of, the, prototypes, from, recognized, secondary, standards, since, the, weights, and, measures, act, 1985, british, law, defines, base, imperial, units, in, terms, of, their, metric, equivalent, the, metric, system, is, routinely, used, in, business, and, technology, within, the, united, kingdom, with, imperial, units, remaining, in, widespread, use, amongst, the, public, all, uk, roads, use, the, imperial, system, except, for, weight, limits, and, newer, height, or, width, restriction, signs, give, metric, alongside, imperial, traders, in, the, uk, may, accept, requests, from, customers, specified, in, imperial, units, and, scales, which, display, in, both, unit, systems, are, commonplace, in, the, retail, trade, metric, price, signs, may, be, accompanied, by, imperial, price, signs, provided, that, the, imperial, signs, are, no, larger, and, no, more, prominent, than, the, metric, ones, the, united, kingdom, completed, its, official, partial, transition, to, the, metric, system, in, 1995, with, imperial, units, still, legally, mandated, for, certain, applications, such, as, draught, beer, and, cider, and, road, signs, therefore, the, speedometers, on, vehicles, sold, in, the, uk, must, be, capable, of, displaying, miles, per, hour, even, though, the, troy, pound, was, outlawed, in, the, uk, in, the, weights, and, measures, act, 1878, the, troy, ounce, may, still, be, used, for, the, weights, of, precious, stones, and, metals, the, original, railways, many, built, in, the, victorian, era, are, a, big, user, of, imperial, units, with, distances, officially, measured, in, miles, and, yards, or, miles, and, chains, and, also, feet, and, inches, and, speeds, are, in, miles, per, hour, some, british, people, still, use, one, or, more, imperial, units, in, everyday, life, for, distance, miles, yards, feet, and, inches, and, some, types, of, volume, measurement, especially, milk, and, beer, in, pints, rarely, for, canned, or, bottled, soft, drinks, or, petrol, as, of, february, 2021, many, british, people, also, still, use, imperial, units, in, everyday, life, for, body, weight, stones, and, pounds, for, adults, pounds, and, ounces, for, babies, government, documents, aimed, at, the, public, may, give, body, weight, and, height, in, imperial, units, as, well, as, in, metric, a, survey, in, 2015, found, that, many, people, did, not, know, their, body, weight, or, height, in, both, systems, as, of, 2017, people, under, the, age, of, 40, preferred, the, metric, system, but, people, aged, 40, and, over, preferred, the, imperial, system, as, in, other, english, speaking, countries, including, australia, canada, and, the, united, states, the, height, of, horses, is, usually, measured, in, hands, standardised, to, 4, inches, 102, mm, fuel, consumption, for, vehicles, is, commonly, stated, in, miles, per, gallon, mpg, though, official, figures, always, include, litres, per, 100, km, equivalents, and, fuel, is, sold, in, litres, when, sold, draught, in, licensed, premises, beer, and, cider, must, be, sold, in, pints, half, pints, or, third, pints, cow, s, milk, is, available, in, both, litre, and, pint, based, containers, in, supermarkets, and, shops, areas, of, land, associated, with, farming, forestry, and, real, estate, are, commonly, advertised, in, acres, and, square, feet, but, for, contracts, and, land, registration, purposes, the, units, are, always, hectares, and, square, metres, office, space, and, industrial, units, are, usually, advertised, in, square, feet, steel, pipe, sizes, are, sold, in, increments, of, inches, while, copper, pipe, is, sold, in, increments, of, millimetres, road, bicycles, have, their, frames, measured, in, centimetres, while, off, road, bicycles, have, their, frames, measured, in, inches, display, sizes, for, screens, on, television, sets, and, computer, monitors, are, always, diagonally, measured, in, inches, food, sold, by, length, or, width, e, g, pizzas, or, sandwiches, is, generally, sold, in, inches, clothing, is, usually, sized, in, inches, with, the, metric, equivalent, often, shown, as, a, small, supplementary, indicator, gas, is, usually, measured, by, the, cubic, foot, or, cubic, metre, but, is, billed, like, electricity, by, the, kilowatt, hour, pre, packaged, products, can, show, both, metric, and, imperial, measures, and, it, is, also, common, to, see, imperial, pack, sizes, with, metric, only, labels, e, g, a, 1, lb, 454, g, tin, of, lyle, s, golden, syrup, is, always, labelled, 454, g, with, no, imperial, indicator, similarly, most, jars, of, jam, and, packs, of, sausages, are, labelled, 454, g, with, no, imperial, indicator, india, began, converting, to, the, metric, system, from, the, imperial, system, between, 1955, and, 1962, the, metric, system, in, weights, and, measures, was, adopted, by, the, indian, parliament, in, december, 1956, with, the, standards, of, weights, and, measures, act, which, took, effect, beginning, 1, october, 1958, by, 1962, metric, units, became, mandatory, and, exclusive, today, all, official, measurements, are, made, in, the, metric, system, in, common, usage, some, older, indians, may, still, refer, to, imperial, units, some, measurements, such, as, the, heights, of, mountains, are, still, recorded, in, feet, tyre, rim, diameters, are, still, measured, in, inches, as, used, worldwide, industries, like, the, construction, and, the, real, estate, industry, still, use, both, the, metric, and, the, imperial, system, though, it, is, more, common, for, sizes, of, homes, to, be, given, in, square, feet, and, land, in, acres, in, standard, indian, english, as, in, australian, canadian, new, zealand, singaporean, and, british, english, metric, units, such, as, the, litre, metre, and, tonne, utilise, the, traditional, spellings, brought, over, from, french, which, differ, from, those, used, in, the, united, states, and, the, philippines, the, imperial, long, ton, is, invariably, spelt, with, one, n, hong, kong, has, three, main, systems, of, units, of, measurement, in, current, use, in, 1976, the, hong, kong, government, started, the, conversion, to, the, metric, system, and, as, of, 2012, measurements, for, government, purposes, such, as, road, signs, are, almost, always, in, metric, units, all, three, systems, are, officially, permitted, for, trade, and, in, the, wider, society, a, mixture, of, all, three, systems, prevails, the, chinese, system, s, most, commonly, used, units, for, length, are, lei, 5, zoeng, 6, cek, 3, cyun, 3, fan, 1, in, descending, scale, order, these, units, are, now, rarely, used, in, daily, life, the, imperial, and, metric, systems, being, preferred, the, imperial, equivalents, are, written, with, the, same, basic, chinese, characters, as, the, chinese, system, in, order, to, distinguish, between, the, units, of, the, two, systems, the, units, can, be, prefixed, with, ying, jing, 1, for, the, imperial, system, and, wa, waa, 4, for, the, chinese, system, in, writing, derived, characters, are, often, used, with, an, additional, mouth, radical, to, the, left, of, the, original, chinese, character, for, writing, imperial, units, the, most, commonly, used, units, are, the, mile, or, li, li, 1, the, yard, or, ma, maa, 5, the, foot, or, chek, cek, 3, and, the, inch, or, tsun, cyun, 3, the, traditional, measure, of, flat, area, is, the, square, foot, fong, 1, cek, 3, ping, 4, fong, 1, cek, 3, of, the, imperial, system, which, is, still, in, common, use, for, real, estate, purposes, the, measurement, of, agricultural, plots, and, fields, is, traditionally, conducted, in, mau, 5, of, the, chinese, system, for, the, measurement, of, volume, hong, kong, officially, uses, the, metric, system, though, the, gallon, gaa, 1, leon, 4, 2, is, also, occasionally, used, during, the, 1970s, the, metric, system, and, si, units, were, introduced, in, canada, to, replace, the, imperial, system, within, the, government, efforts, to, implement, the, metric, system, were, extensive, almost, any, agency, institution, or, function, provided, by, the, government, uses, si, units, exclusively, imperial, units, were, eliminated, from, all, public, road, signs, and, both, systems, of, measurement, will, still, be, found, on, privately, owned, signs, such, as, the, height, warnings, at, the, entrance, of, a, parkade, in, the, 1980s, momentum, to, fully, convert, to, the, metric, system, stalled, when, the, government, of, brian, mulroney, was, elected, there, was, heavy, opposition, to, metrication, and, as, a, compromise, the, government, maintains, legal, definitions, for, and, allows, use, of, imperial, units, as, long, as, metric, units, are, shown, as, well, the, law, requires, that, measured, products, such, as, fuel, and, meat, be, priced, in, metric, units, and, an, imperial, price, can, be, shown, if, a, metric, price, is, present, there, tends, to, be, leniency, in, regards, to, fruits, and, vegetables, being, priced, in, imperial, units, only, environment, canada, still, offers, an, imperial, unit, option, beside, metric, units, even, though, weather, is, typically, measured, and, reported, in, metric, units, in, the, canadian, media, some, radio, stations, near, the, united, states, border, such, as, cimx, and, cidr, primarily, use, imperial, units, to, report, the, weather, railways, in, canada, also, continue, to, use, imperial, units, imperial, units, are, still, used, in, ordinary, conversation, today, canadians, typically, use, a, mix, of, metric, and, imperial, measurements, in, their, daily, lives, the, use, of, the, metric, and, imperial, systems, varies, by, age, the, older, generation, mostly, uses, the, imperial, system, while, the, younger, generation, more, often, uses, the, metric, system, quebec, has, implemented, metrication, more, fully, newborns, are, measured, in, si, at, hospitals, but, the, birth, weight, and, length, is, also, announced, to, family, and, friends, in, imperial, units, drivers, licences, use, si, units, though, many, english, speaking, canadians, give, their, height, and, weight, in, imperial, in, livestock, auction, markets, cattle, are, sold, in, dollars, per, hundredweight, short, whereas, hogs, are, sold, in, dollars, per, hundred, kilograms, imperial, units, still, dominate, in, recipes, construction, house, renovation, and, gardening, land, is, now, surveyed, and, registered, in, metric, units, whilst, initial, surveys, used, imperial, units, for, example, partitioning, of, farmland, on, the, prairies, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, was, done, in, imperial, units, this, accounts, for, imperial, units, of, distance, and, area, retaining, wide, use, in, the, prairie, provinces, in, english, speaking, canada, commercial, and, residential, spaces, are, mostly, but, not, exclusively, constructed, using, square, feet, while, in, french, speaking, quebec, commercial, and, residential, spaces, are, constructed, in, metres, and, advertised, using, both, square, metres, and, square, feet, as, equivalents, carpet, or, flooring, tile, is, purchased, by, the, square, foot, but, less, frequently, also, in, square, metres, motor, vehicle, fuel, consumption, is, reported, in, both, litres, per, 100, km, and, statute, miles, per, imperial, gallon, leading, to, the, erroneous, impression, that, canadian, vehicles, are, 20, more, fuel, efficient, than, their, apparently, identical, american, counterparts, for, which, fuel, economy, is, reported, in, statute, miles, per, us, gallon, neither, country, specifies, which, gallon, is, used, canadian, railways, maintain, exclusive, use, of, imperial, measurements, to, describe, train, length, feet, train, height, feet, capacity, tons, speed, mph, and, trackage, miles, imperial, units, also, retain, common, use, in, firearms, and, ammunition, imperial, measures, are, still, used, in, the, description, of, cartridge, types, even, when, the, cartridge, is, of, relatively, recent, invention, e, g, 204, ruger, 17, hmr, where, the, calibre, is, expressed, in, decimal, fractions, of, an, inch, ammunition, that, is, already, classified, in, metric, is, still, kept, metric, e, g, 9, 19mm, in, the, manufacture, of, ammunition, bullet, and, powder, weights, are, expressed, in, terms, of, grains, for, both, metric, and, imperial, cartridges, in, keeping, with, the, international, standard, air, navigation, is, based, on, nautical, units, e, g, the, nautical, mile, which, is, neither, imperial, nor, metric, and, altitude, is, measured, in, imperial, feet, while, metrication, in, australia, has, largely, ended, the, official, use, of, imperial, units, for, particular, measurements, international, use, of, imperial, units, is, still, followed, the, influence, of, british, and, american, culture, in, australia, has, been, noted, to, be, a, cause, for, residual, use, of, imperial, units, of, measure, new, zealand, introduced, the, metric, system, on, 15, december, 1976, aviation, was, exempt, with, altitude, and, airport, elevation, continuing, to, be, measured, in, feet, whilst, navigation, is, done, in, nautical, miles, all, other, aspects, fuel, quantity, aircraft, weight, runway, length, etc, use, metric, units, screen, sizes, for, devices, such, as, televisions, monitors, and, phones, and, wheel, rim, sizes, for, vehicles, are, stated, in, inches, as, is, the, convention, in, the, rest, of, the, world, and, a, 1992, study, found, a, continued, use, of, imperial, units, for, birth, weight, and, human, height, alongside, metric, units, ireland, has, officially, changed, over, to, the, metric, system, since, entering, the, european, union, with, distances, on, new, road, signs, being, metric, since, 1997, and, speed, limits, being, metric, since, 2005, the, imperial, system, remains, in, limited, use, for, sales, of, beer, in, pubs, traditionally, sold, by, the, pint, all, other, goods, are, required, by, law, to, be, sold, in, metric, units, with, traditional, quantities, being, retained, for, goods, like, butter, and, sausages, which, are, sold, in, 454, grams, 1, lb, packaging, the, majority, of, cars, sold, pre, 2005, feature, speedometers, with, miles, per, hour, as, the, primary, unit, but, with, a, kilometres, per, hour, display, often, signs, such, as, those, for, bridge, height, can, display, both, metric, and, imperial, units, imperial, measurements, continue, to, be, used, colloquially, by, the, general, population, especially, with, height, and, distance, measurements, such, as, feet, inches, and, acres, as, well, as, for, weight, with, pounds, and, stones, still, in, common, use, among, people, of, all, ages, measurements, such, as, yards, have, fallen, out, of, favour, with, younger, generations, ireland, s, railways, still, use, imperial, measurements, for, distances, and, speed, signage, property, is, usually, listed, in, square, feet, as, well, as, metres, also, horse, racing, in, ireland, still, continues, to, use, stones, pounds, miles, and, furlongs, as, measurements, imperial, measurements, remain, in, general, use, in, the, bahamas, legally, both, the, imperial, and, metric, systems, are, recognised, by, the, weights, and, measures, act, 2006, both, imperial, units, and, metric, units, are, used, in, belize, both, systems, are, legally, recognized, by, the, national, metrology, act, according, to, the, cia, in, june, 2009, myanmar, was, one, of, three, countries, that, had, not, adopted, the, si, metric, system, as, their, official, system, of, weights, and, measures, metrication, efforts, began, in, 2011, the, burmese, government, set, a, goal, to, metricate, by, 2019, which, was, not, met, with, the, help, of, the, german, national, metrology, institute, some, imperial, measurements, remain, in, limited, use, in, malaysia, the, philippines, sri, lanka, and, south, africa, measurements, in, feet, and, inches, especially, for, a, person, s, height, are, frequently, encountered, in, conversation, and, non, governmental, publications, prior, to, metrication, it, was, a, common, practice, in, malaysia, for, people, to, refer, to, unnamed, locations, and, small, settlements, along, major, roads, by, referring, to, how, many, miles, the, said, locations, were, from, the, nearest, major, town, in, some, cases, these, eventually, became, the, official, names, of, the, locations, in, other, cases, such, names, have, been, largely, or, completely, superseded, by, new, names, an, example, of, the, former, is, batu, 32, literally, mile, 32, in, malay, which, refers, to, the, area, surrounding, the, intersection, between, federal, route, 22, the, tamparuli, sandakan, highway, and, federal, route, 13, the, sandakan, tawau, highway, the, area, is, so, named, because, it, is, 32, miles, west, of, sandakan, the, nearest, major, town, petrol, is, still, sold, by, the, imperial, gallon, in, anguilla, antigua, and, barbuda, belize, myanmar, the, cayman, islands, dominica, grenada, montserrat, st, kitts, and, nevis, and, st, vincent, and, the, grenadines, the, united, arab, emirates, cabinet, in, 2009, issued, the, decree, no, 270, 3, specifying, that, from, 1, january, 2010, the, new, unit, sale, price, for, petrol, will, be, the, litre, and, not, the, gallon, which, was, in, line, with, the, uae, cabinet, decision, no, 31, of, 2006, on, the, national, system, of, measurement, which, mandates, the, use, of, international, system, of, units, as, a, basis, for, the, legal, units, of, measurement, in, the, country, sierra, leone, switched, to, selling, fuel, by, the, litre, in, may, 2011, in, october, 2011, the, antigua, and, barbuda, government, announced, the, re, launch, of, the, metrication, programme, in, accordance, with, the, metrology, act, 2007, which, established, the, international, system, of, units, as, the, legal, system, of, units, the, antigua, and, barbuda, government, has, committed, to, a, full, conversion, from, the, imperial, system, by, the, first, quarter, of, 2015
