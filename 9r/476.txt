polyvinyl, chloride, alternatively, poly, vinyl, chloride, colloquial, vinyl, or, polyvinyl, abbreviated, pvc, is, the, world, s, third, most, widely, produced, synthetic, polymer, of, plastic, after, polyethylene, and, polypropylene, about, 40, million, tons, of, pvc, are, produced, each, year, pvc, comes, in, rigid, sometimes, abbreviated, as, rpvc, and, flexible, forms, rigid, pvc, is, used, in, construction, for, pipes, doors, and, windows, it, is, also, used, in, making, plastic, bottles, packaging, and, bank, or, membership, cards, adding, plasticizers, makes, pvc, softer, and, more, flexible, it, is, used, in, plumbing, electrical, cable, insulation, flooring, signage, phonograph, records, inflatable, products, and, in, rubber, substitutes, with, cotton, or, linen, it, is, used, in, the, production, of, canvas, polyvinyl, chloride, is, a, white, brittle, solid, it, is, soluble, in, ketones, chlorinated, solvents, dimethylformamide, thf, and, dmac, pvc, was, synthesized, in, 1872, by, german, chemist, eugen, baumann, after, extended, investigation, and, experimentation, the, polymer, appeared, as, a, white, solid, inside, a, flask, of, vinyl, chloride, that, had, been, left, on, a, shelf, sheltered, from, sunlight, for, four, weeks, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, russian, chemist, ivan, ostromislensky, and, fritz, klatte, of, the, german, chemical, company, griesheim, elektron, both, attempted, to, use, pvc, in, commercial, products, but, difficulties, in, processing, the, rigid, sometimes, brittle, polymer, thwarted, their, efforts, waldo, semon, and, the, b, f, goodrich, company, developed, a, method, in, 1926, to, plasticize, pvc, by, blending, it, with, various, additives, including, the, use, of, dibutyl, phthalate, by, 1933, polyvinyl, chloride, is, produced, by, polymerization, of, the, vinyl, chloride, monomer, vcm, as, shown, about, 80, of, production, involves, suspension, polymerization, emulsion, polymerization, accounts, for, about, 12, and, bulk, polymerization, accounts, for, 8, suspension, polymerization, produces, particles, with, average, diameters, of, 100, 180, m, whereas, emulsion, polymerization, gives, much, smaller, particles, of, average, size, around, 0, 2, m, vcm, and, water, are, introduced, into, the, reactor, along, with, a, polymerization, initiator, and, other, additives, the, contents, of, the, reaction, vessel, are, pressurized, and, continually, mixed, to, maintain, the, suspension, and, ensure, a, uniform, particle, size, of, the, pvc, resin, the, reaction, is, exothermic, and, thus, requires, cooling, as, the, volume, is, reduced, during, the, reaction, pvc, is, denser, than, vcm, water, is, continually, added, to, the, mixture, to, maintain, the, suspension, pvc, may, be, manufactured, from, ethylene, which, can, be, produced, from, either, naphtha, or, ethane, feedstock, the, polymers, are, linear, and, are, strong, the, monomers, are, mainly, arranged, head, to, tail, meaning, that, chloride, is, located, on, alternating, carbon, centres, pvc, has, mainly, an, atactic, stereochemistry, which, means, that, the, relative, stereochemistry, of, the, chloride, centres, are, random, some, degree, of, syndiotacticity, of, the, chain, gives, a, few, percent, crystallinity, that, is, influential, on, the, properties, of, the, material, about, 57, of, the, mass, of, pvc, is, chlorine, the, presence, of, chloride, groups, gives, the, polymer, very, different, properties, from, the, structurally, related, material, polyethylene, at, 1, 4, g, cm, 3, pvc, s, density, is, also, higher, than, structurally, related, plastics, such, as, polyethylene, 0, 88, 0, 96, g, cm, 3, and, polymethylmethacrylate, 1, 18, g, cm, 3, about, half, of, the, world, s, pvc, production, capacity, is, in, china, despite, the, closure, of, many, chinese, pvc, plants, due, to, issues, complying, with, environmental, regulations, and, poor, capacities, of, scale, the, largest, single, producer, of, pvc, as, of, 2018, is, shin, etsu, chemical, of, japan, with, a, global, share, of, around, 30, the, product, of, the, polymerization, process, is, unmodified, pvc, before, pvc, can, be, made, into, finished, products, it, always, requires, conversion, into, a, compound, by, the, incorporation, of, additives, but, not, necessarily, all, of, the, following, such, as, heat, stabilizers, uv, stabilizers, plasticizers, processing, aids, impact, modifiers, thermal, modifiers, fillers, flame, retardants, biocides, blowing, agents, and, smoke, suppressors, and, optionally, pigments, the, choice, of, additives, used, for, the, pvc, finished, product, is, controlled, by, the, cost, performance, requirements, of, the, end, use, specification, underground, pipe, window, frames, intravenous, tubing, and, flooring, all, have, very, different, ingredients, to, suit, their, performance, requirements, previously, polychlorinated, biphenyls, pcbs, were, added, to, certain, pvc, products, as, flame, retardants, and, stabilizers, among, the, common, plastics, pvc, is, unique, in, its, acceptance, of, large, amounts, of, plasticizer, with, gradual, changes, in, physical, properties, from, a, rigid, solid, to, a, soft, gel, and, almost, 90, of, all, plasticizer, production, is, used, in, making, flexible, pvc, the, majority, is, used, in, films, and, cable, sheathing, flexible, pvc, can, consist, of, over, 85, plasticizer, by, mass, however, unplasticized, pvc, upvc, should, not, contain, any, the, most, common, class, of, plasticizers, used, in, pvc, is, phthalates, which, are, diesters, of, phthalic, acid, phthalates, can, be, categorized, as, high, and, low, depending, on, their, molecular, weight, low, phthalates, such, as, bis, 2, ethylhexyl, phthalate, dehp, and, dibutyl, phthalate, dbp, have, increased, health, risks, and, are, generally, being, phased, out, high, molecular, weight, phthalates, such, as, diisononyl, phthalate, dinp, and, diisodecyl, phthalate, didp, are, generally, considered, safer, while, dehp, has, been, medically, approved, for, many, years, for, use, in, medical, devices, it, was, permanently, banned, for, use, in, children, s, products, in, the, us, in, 2008, by, us, congress, the, pvc, dehp, combination, had, proved, to, be, very, suitable, for, making, blood, bags, because, dehp, stabilizes, red, blood, cells, minimizing, hemolysis, red, blood, cell, rupture, however, dehp, is, coming, under, increasing, pressure, in, europe, the, assessment, of, potential, risks, related, to, phthalates, and, in, particular, the, use, of, dehp, in, pvc, medical, devices, was, subject, to, scientific, and, policy, review, by, the, european, union, authorities, and, on, 21, march, 2010, a, specific, labeling, requirement, was, introduced, across, the, eu, for, all, devices, containing, phthalates, that, are, classified, as, cmr, carcinogenic, mutagenic, or, toxic, to, reproduction, the, label, aims, to, enable, healthcare, professionals, to, use, this, equipment, safely, and, where, needed, take, appropriate, precautionary, measures, for, patients, at, risk, of, over, exposure, bazn, stabilisers, have, successfully, replaced, cadmium, based, stabilisers, in, europe, in, many, pvc, semi, rigid, and, flexible, applications, in, europe, particularly, belgium, there, has, been, a, commitment, to, eliminate, the, use, of, cadmium, previously, used, as, a, part, component, of, heat, stabilizers, in, window, profiles, and, phase, out, lead, based, heat, stabilizers, as, used, in, pipe, and, profile, areas, such, as, liquid, autodiachromate, and, calcium, polyhydrocummate, by, 2015, according, to, the, final, report, of, vinyl, 2010, cadmium, was, eliminated, across, europe, by, 2007, the, progressive, substitution, of, lead, based, stabilizers, is, also, confirmed, in, the, same, document, showing, a, reduction, of, 75, since, 2000, and, ongoing, this, is, confirmed, by, the, corresponding, growth, in, calcium, based, stabilizers, used, as, an, alternative, to, lead, based, stabilizers, more, and, more, also, outside, europe, some, of, the, most, crucial, additives, are, heat, stabilizers, these, agents, minimize, loss, of, hcl, a, degradation, process, that, starts, above, 70, c, 158, f, and, is, autocatalytic, many, diverse, agents, have, been, used, including, traditionally, derivatives, of, heavy, metals, lead, cadmium, metallic, soaps, metal, salts, of, fatty, acids, such, as, calcium, stearate, are, common, in, flexible, pvc, applications, pvc, is, a, thermoplastic, polymer, its, properties, are, usually, categorized, based, on, rigid, and, flexible, pvcs, the, heat, stability, of, raw, pvc, is, very, poor, so, the, addition, of, a, heat, stabilizer, during, the, process, is, necessary, in, order, to, ensure, the, product, s, properties, traditional, product, pvc, has, a, maximum, operating, temperature, around, 60, c, 140, f, when, heat, distortion, begins, to, occur, as, a, thermoplastic, pvc, has, an, inherent, insulation, that, aids, in, reducing, condensation, formation, and, resisting, internal, temperature, changes, for, hot, and, cold, liquids, roughly, half, of, the, world, s, pvc, resin, manufactured, annually, is, used, for, producing, pipes, for, municipal, and, industrial, applications, in, the, private, homeowner, market, it, accounts, for, 66, of, the, household, market, in, the, us, and, in, household, sanitary, sewer, pipe, applications, it, accounts, for, 75, buried, pvc, pipes, in, both, water, and, sanitary, sewer, applications, that, are, 100, mm, 4, in, in, diameter, and, larger, are, typically, joined, by, means, of, a, gasket, sealed, joint, the, most, common, type, of, gasket, utilized, in, north, america, is, a, metal, reinforced, elastomer, commonly, referred, to, as, a, rieber, sealing, system, pvc, is, often, used, as, the, insulating, sheath, on, electrical, cables, pvc, is, chosen, because, of, its, good, electrical, insulation, ease, of, extrusion, and, resistance, to, burn, in, a, fire, pvc, can, form, hydrogen, chloride, fumes, the, chlorine, serves, to, scavenge, free, radicals, making, pvc, coated, wires, fire, retardant, while, hydrogen, chloride, fumes, can, also, pose, a, health, hazard, in, their, own, right, it, dissolves, in, moisture, and, breaks, down, onto, surfaces, particularly, in, areas, where, the, air, is, cool, enough, to, breathe, so, would, not, be, inhaled, pvc, is, widely, and, heavily, used, in, construction, and, building, industry, for, example, vinyl, siding, is, extensively, is, a, popular, low, maintenance, material, particularly, in, ireland, the, united, kingdom, the, united, states, and, canada, the, material, comes, in, a, range, of, colors, and, finishes, including, a, photo, effect, wood, finish, and, is, used, as, a, substitute, for, painted, wood, mostly, for, window, frames, and, sills, when, installing, insulated, glazing, in, new, buildings, or, to, replace, older, single, glazed, windows, as, it, does, not, decompose, and, is, weather, resistant, other, uses, include, fascia, and, siding, or, weatherboarding, this, material, has, almost, entirely, replaced, the, use, of, cast, iron, for, plumbing, and, drainage, being, used, for, waste, pipes, drainpipes, gutters, and, downspouts, pvc, is, known, as, having, strong, resistance, against, chemicals, sunlight, and, oxidation, from, water, polyvinyl, chloride, is, formed, in, flat, sheets, in, a, variety, of, thicknesses, and, colors, as, flat, sheets, pvc, is, often, expanded, to, create, voids, in, the, interior, of, the, material, providing, additional, thickness, without, additional, weight, and, minimal, extra, cost, see, closed, cell, pvc, foamboard, sheets, are, cut, using, saws, and, rotary, cutting, equipment, plasticized, pvc, is, also, used, to, produce, thin, colored, or, clear, adhesive, backed, films, referred, to, simply, as, vinyl, these, films, are, typically, cut, on, a, computer, controlled, plotter, see, vinyl, cutter, or, printed, in, a, wide, format, printer, these, sheets, and, films, are, used, to, produce, a, wide, variety, of, commercial, signage, products, vinyl, wraps, or, racing, stripes, on, vehicles, for, aesthetics, or, as, wrap, advertising, and, general, purpose, stickers, pvc, fabric, is, water, resistant, used, for, its, weather, resistant, qualities, in, coats, skiing, equipment, shoes, jackets, and, aprons, the, two, main, application, areas, for, single, use, medically, approved, pvc, compounds, are, flexible, containers, and, tubing, containers, used, for, blood, and, blood, components, for, urine, collection, or, for, ostomy, products, and, tubing, used, for, blood, taking, and, blood, giving, sets, catheters, heart, lung, bypass, sets, hemodialysis, sets, etc, in, europe, the, consumption, of, pvc, from, medical, devices, is, approximately, 85, 000, tons, each, year, almost, one, third, of, plastic, based, medical, devices, are, made, from, pvc, pvc, has, been, applied, to, various, items, such, as, bottles, packaging, films, blister, packs, cling, wraps, and, seals, on, metal, lids, pvc, may, be, extruded, under, pressure, to, encase, wire, rope, and, aircraft, cable, used, for, general, purpose, applications, pvc, coated, wire, rope, is, easier, to, handle, resists, corrosion, and, abrasion, and, may, be, color, coded, for, increased, visibility, it, is, found, in, a, variety, of, industries, and, environments, both, indoor, and, out, molded, pvc, is, used, to, produce, phonograph, or, vinyl, records, pvc, piping, is, a, cheaper, alternative, to, metal, tubing, used, in, musical, instrument, making, it, is, therefore, a, common, alternative, when, making, wind, instruments, often, for, leisure, or, for, rarer, instruments, such, as, the, contrabass, flute, an, instrument, that, is, almost, exclusively, built, from, pvc, tube, is, the, thongophone, a, percussion, instrument, that, is, played, by, slapping, the, open, tubes, with, a, flip, flop, or, similar, pvc, is, also, used, as, a, raw, material, in, automotive, underbody, coating, pvc, can, be, usefully, modified, by, chlorination, which, increases, its, chlorine, content, to, or, above, 67, chlorinated, polyvinyl, chloride, cpvc, as, it, is, called, is, produced, by, chlorination, of, aqueous, solution, of, suspension, pvc, particles, followed, by, exposure, to, uv, light, which, initiates, the, free, radical, chlorination, phthalates, which, are, incorporated, into, plastics, as, plasticizers, comprise, approximately, 70, of, the, us, plasticizer, market, phthalates, are, by, design, not, covalently, bound, to, the, polymer, matrix, which, makes, them, highly, susceptible, to, leaching, phthalates, are, contained, in, plastics, at, high, percentages, for, example, they, can, contribute, up, to, 40, by, weight, to, intravenous, medical, bags, and, up, to, 80, by, weight, in, medical, tubing, vinyl, products, are, pervasive, including, toys, car, interiors, shower, curtains, and, flooring, and, initially, release, chemical, gases, into, the, air, some, studies, indicate, that, this, outgassing, of, additives, may, contribute, to, health, complications, and, have, resulted, in, a, call, for, banning, the, use, of, dehp, on, shower, curtains, among, other, uses, in, 2004, a, joint, swedish, danish, research, team, found, a, statistical, association, between, allergies, in, children, and, indoor, air, levels, of, dehp, and, bbzp, butyl, benzyl, phthalate, which, is, used, in, vinyl, flooring, in, december, 2006, the, european, chemicals, bureau, of, the, european, commission, released, a, final, draft, risk, assessment, of, bbzp, which, found, no, concern, for, consumer, exposure, including, exposure, to, children, lead, compounds, had, previously, been, widely, added, to, pvc, to, improve, workability, and, stability, but, have, been, shown, to, leach, into, drinking, water, from, pvc, pipes, in, europe, the, use, of, lead, based, stabilizers, has, been, discontinued, the, vinylplus, voluntary, commitment, which, began, in, 2000, saw, european, stabiliser, producers, association, espa, members, complete, the, replacement, of, pb, based, stabilisers, in, 2015, in, the, early, 1970s, the, carcinogenicity, of, vinyl, chloride, usually, called, vinyl, chloride, monomer, or, vcm, was, linked, to, cancers, in, workers, in, the, polyvinyl, chloride, industry, specifically, workers, in, polymerization, section, of, a, b, f, goodrich, plant, near, louisville, kentucky, were, diagnosed, with, liver, angiosarcoma, also, known, as, hemangiosarcoma, a, rare, disease, since, that, time, studies, of, pvc, workers, in, australia, italy, germany, and, the, uk, have, all, associated, certain, types, of, occupational, cancers, with, exposure, to, vinyl, chloride, and, it, has, become, accepted, that, vcm, is, a, carcinogen, pvc, produces, hcl, and, carbon, dioxide, upon, combustion, studies, of, household, waste, burning, indicate, consistent, increases, in, dioxin, generation, with, increasing, pvc, concentrations, according, to, the, u, s, epa, dioxin, inventory, landfill, fires, are, likely, to, represent, an, even, larger, source, of, dioxin, to, the, environment, a, survey, of, international, studies, consistently, identifies, high, dioxin, concentrations, in, areas, affected, by, open, waste, burning, and, a, study, that, looked, at, the, homologue, pattern, found, the, sample, with, the, highest, dioxin, concentration, was, typical, for, the, pyrolysis, of, pvc, other, eu, studies, indicate, that, pvc, likely, accounts, for, the, overwhelming, majority, of, chlorine, that, is, available, for, dioxin, formation, during, landfill, fires, the, next, largest, sources, of, dioxin, in, the, u, s, epa, inventory, are, medical, and, municipal, waste, incinerators, various, studies, have, been, conducted, that, reach, contradictory, results, for, instance, a, study, of, commercial, scale, incinerators, showed, no, relationship, between, the, pvc, content, of, the, waste, and, dioxin, emissions, other, studies, have, shown, a, clear, correlation, between, dioxin, formation, and, chloride, content, and, indicate, that, pvc, is, a, significant, contributor, to, the, formation, of, both, dioxin, and, pcb, in, incinerators, in, february, 2007, the, technical, and, scientific, advisory, committee, of, the, us, green, building, council, usgbc, released, its, report, on, a, pvc, avoidance, related, materials, credit, for, the, leed, green, building, rating, system, the, report, concludes, that, no, single, material, shows, up, as, the, best, across, all, the, human, health, and, environmental, impact, categories, nor, as, the, worst, but, that, the, risk, of, dioxin, emissions, puts, pvc, consistently, among, the, worst, materials, for, human, health, impacts, in, europe, the, overwhelming, importance, of, combustion, conditions, on, dioxin, formation, has, been, established, by, numerous, researchers, the, single, most, important, factor, in, forming, dioxin, like, compounds, is, the, temperature, of, the, combustion, gases, oxygen, concentration, also, plays, a, major, role, on, dioxin, formation, but, not, the, chlorine, content, several, studies, have, also, shown, that, removing, pvc, from, waste, would, not, significantly, reduce, the, quantity, of, dioxins, emitted, the, eu, commission, published, in, july, 2000, a, green, paper, on, the, environmental, issues, of, pvc, a, study, commissioned, by, the, european, commission, on, life, cycle, assessment, of, pvc, and, of, principal, competing, materials, states, that, recent, studies, show, that, the, presence, of, pvc, has, no, significant, effect, on, the, amount, of, dioxins, released, through, incineration, of, plastic, waste, in, europe, developments, in, pvc, waste, management, have, been, monitored, by, vinyl, 2010, established, in, 2000, vinyl, 2010, s, objective, was, to, recycle, 200, 000, tonnes, of, post, consumer, pvc, waste, per, year, in, europe, by, the, end, of, 2010, excluding, waste, streams, already, subject, to, other, or, more, specific, legislation, such, as, the, european, directives, on, end, of, life, vehicles, packaging, and, waste, electric, and, electronic, equipment, since, june, 2011, it, is, followed, by, vinylplus, a, new, set, of, targets, for, sustainable, development, its, main, target, is, to, recycle, 800, 000, tonnes, per, year, of, pvc, by, 2020, including, 100, 000, tonnes, of, difficult, to, recycle, waste, one, facilitator, for, collection, and, recycling, of, pvc, waste, is, recovinyl, the, reported, and, audited, mechanically, recycled, pvc, tonnage, in, 2016, was, 568, 695, tonnes, which, in, 2018, had, increased, to, 739, 525, tonnes, one, approach, to, address, the, problem, of, waste, pvc, is, also, through, the, process, called, vinyloop, it, is, a, mechanical, recycling, process, using, a, solvent, to, separate, pvc, from, other, materials, this, solvent, turns, in, a, closed, loop, process, in, which, the, solvent, is, recycled, recycled, pvc, is, used, in, place, of, virgin, pvc, in, various, applications, coatings, for, swimming, pools, shoe, soles, hoses, diaphragms, tunnel, coated, fabrics, pvc, sheets, this, recycled, pvc, s, primary, energy, demand, is, 46, percent, lower, than, conventional, produced, pvc, so, the, use, of, recycled, material, leads, to, a, significant, better, ecological, footprint, the, global, warming, potential, is, 39, percent, lower, in, november, 2005, one, of, the, largest, hospital, networks, in, the, us, catholic, healthcare, west, signed, a, contract, with, b, braun, melsungen, for, vinyl, free, intravenous, bags, and, tubing, in, january, 2012, a, major, us, west, coast, healthcare, provider, kaiser, permanente, announced, that, it, will, no, longer, buy, intravenous, iv, medical, equipment, made, with, pvc, and, dehp, type, plasticizers, in, 1998, the, u, s, consumer, product, safety, commission, cpsc, arrived, at, a, voluntary, agreement, with, manufacturers, to, remove, phthalates, from, pvc, rattles, teethers, baby, bottle, nipples, and, pacifiers, plasticized, pvc, is, a, common, material, for, medical, gloves, due, to, vinyl, gloves, having, less, flexibility, and, elasticity, several, guidelines, recommend, either, latex, or, nitrile, gloves, for, clinical, care, and, procedures, that, require, manual, dexterity, and, or, that, involve, patient, contact, for, more, than, a, brief, period, vinyl, gloves, show, poor, resistance, to, many, chemicals, including, glutaraldehyde, based, products, and, alcohols, used, in, formulation, of, disinfectants, for, swabbing, down, work, surfaces, or, in, hand, rubs, the, additives, in, pvc, are, also, known, to, cause, skin, reactions, such, as, allergic, contact, dermatitis, these, are, for, example, the, antioxidant, bisphenol, a, the, biocide, benzisothiazolinone, propylene, glycol, adipate, polyester, and, ethylhexylmaleate, the, life, cycle, sustainability, and, appropriateness, of, pvc, are, discussed, in, europe, a, 2021, vinylplus, progress, report, indicated, that, 731, 461, tonnes, pvc, were, recycled, in, 2020, a, 5, reduction, compared, to, 2019, due, to, the, covid, 19, pandemic
