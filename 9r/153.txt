an, eclipse, is, an, astronomical, event, which, occurs, when, an, astronomical, object, or, spacecraft, is, temporarily, obscured, by, passing, into, the, shadow, of, another, body, or, by, having, another, body, pass, between, it, and, the, viewer, this, alignment, of, three, celestial, objects, is, known, as, a, syzygy, an, eclipse, is, the, result, of, either, an, occultation, completely, hidden, or, a, transit, partially, hidden, a, deep, eclipse, or, deep, occultation, is, when, a, small, astronomical, object, is, behind, a, bigger, one, the, term, eclipse, is, most, often, used, to, describe, either, a, solar, eclipse, when, the, moon, s, shadow, crosses, the, earth, s, surface, or, a, lunar, eclipse, when, the, moon, moves, into, the, earth, s, shadow, however, it, can, also, refer, to, such, events, beyond, the, earth, moon, system, for, example, a, planet, moving, into, the, shadow, cast, by, one, of, its, moons, a, moon, passing, into, the, shadow, cast, by, its, host, planet, or, a, moon, passing, into, the, shadow, of, another, moon, a, binary, star, system, can, also, produce, eclipses, if, the, plane, of, the, orbit, of, its, constituent, stars, intersects, the, observer, s, position, for, the, special, cases, of, solar, and, lunar, eclipses, these, only, happen, during, an, eclipse, season, the, two, times, of, each, year, when, the, plane, of, the, earth, s, orbit, around, the, sun, crosses, with, the, plane, of, the, moon, s, orbit, around, the, earth, and, the, line, defined, by, the, intersecting, planes, points, near, the, sun, the, type, of, solar, eclipse, that, happens, during, each, season, whether, total, annular, hybrid, or, partial, depends, on, apparent, sizes, of, the, sun, and, moon, if, the, orbit, of, the, earth, around, the, sun, and, the, moon, s, orbit, around, the, earth, were, both, in, the, same, plane, with, each, other, then, eclipses, would, happen, every, month, there, would, be, a, lunar, eclipse, at, every, full, moon, and, a, solar, eclipse, at, every, new, moon, it, is, because, of, the, non, planar, differences, that, eclipses, are, not, a, common, event, if, both, orbits, were, perfectly, circular, then, each, eclipse, would, be, the, same, type, every, month, lunar, eclipses, can, be, viewed, from, the, entire, nightside, half, of, the, earth, but, solar, eclipses, particularly, total, eclipses, occurring, at, any, one, particular, point, on, the, earth, s, surface, are, very, rare, events, that, can, be, many, decades, apart, the, term, is, derived, from, the, ancient, greek, noun, kleipsis, which, means, the, abandonment, the, downfall, or, the, darkening, of, a, heavenly, body, which, is, derived, from, the, verb, ekle, p, which, means, to, abandon, to, darken, or, to, cease, to, exist, a, combination, of, prefix, ek, from, preposition, ek, out, and, of, verb, le, p, to, be, absent, for, any, two, objects, in, space, a, line, can, be, extended, from, the, first, through, the, second, the, latter, object, will, block, some, amount, of, light, being, emitted, by, the, former, creating, a, region, of, shadow, around, the, axis, of, the, line, typically, these, objects, are, moving, with, respect, to, each, other, and, their, surroundings, so, the, resulting, shadow, will, sweep, through, a, region, of, space, only, passing, through, any, particular, location, in, the, region, for, a, fixed, interval, of, time, as, viewed, from, such, a, location, this, shadowing, event, is, known, as, an, eclipse, typically, the, cross, section, of, the, objects, involved, in, an, astronomical, eclipse, is, roughly, disk, shaped, the, region, of, an, object, s, shadow, during, an, eclipse, is, divided, into, three, parts, a, total, eclipse, occurs, when, the, observer, is, within, the, umbra, an, annular, eclipse, when, the, observer, is, within, the, antumbra, and, a, partial, eclipse, when, the, observer, is, within, the, penumbra, during, a, lunar, eclipse, only, the, umbra, and, penumbra, are, applicable, because, the, antumbra, of, the, sun, earth, system, lies, far, beyond, the, moon, analogously, earth, s, apparent, diameter, from, the, viewpoint, of, the, moon, is, nearly, four, times, that, of, the, sun, and, thus, cannot, produce, an, annular, eclipse, the, same, terms, may, be, used, analogously, in, describing, other, eclipses, e, g, the, antumbra, of, deimos, crossing, mars, or, phobos, entering, mars, s, penumbra, the, first, contact, occurs, when, the, eclipsing, object, s, disc, first, starts, to, impinge, on, the, light, source, second, contact, is, when, the, disc, moves, completely, within, the, light, source, third, contact, when, it, starts, to, move, out, of, the, light, and, fourth, or, last, contact, when, it, finally, leaves, the, light, source, s, disc, entirely, for, spherical, bodies, when, the, occulting, object, is, smaller, than, the, star, the, length, l, of, the, umbra, s, cone, shaped, shadow, is, given, by, where, r, s, is, the, radius, of, the, star, r, o, is, the, occulting, object, s, radius, and, r, is, the, distance, from, the, star, to, the, occulting, object, for, earth, on, average, l, is, equal, to, 1, 384, 10, 6, km, which, is, much, larger, than, the, moon, s, semimajor, axis, of, 3, 844, 10, 5, km, hence, the, umbral, cone, of, the, earth, can, completely, envelop, the, moon, during, a, lunar, eclipse, if, the, occulting, object, has, an, atmosphere, however, some, of, the, luminosity, of, the, star, can, be, refracted, into, the, volume, of, the, umbra, this, occurs, for, example, during, an, eclipse, of, the, moon, by, the, earth, producing, a, faint, ruddy, illumination, of, the, moon, even, at, totality, on, earth, the, shadow, cast, during, an, eclipse, moves, very, approximately, at, 1, km, per, sec, this, depends, on, the, location, of, the, shadow, on, the, earth, and, the, angle, in, which, it, is, moving, an, eclipse, cycle, takes, place, when, eclipses, in, a, series, are, separated, by, a, certain, interval, of, time, this, happens, when, the, orbital, motions, of, the, bodies, form, repeating, harmonic, patterns, a, particular, instance, is, the, saros, which, results, in, a, repetition, of, a, solar, or, lunar, eclipse, every, 6, 585, 3, days, or, a, little, over, 18, years, because, this, is, not, a, whole, number, of, days, successive, eclipses, will, be, visible, from, different, parts, of, the, world, in, one, saros, period, there, are, 239, 0, anomalistic, periods, 241, 0, sidereal, periods, 242, 0, nodical, periods, and, 223, 0, synodic, periods, although, the, orbit, of, the, moon, does, not, give, exact, integers, the, numbers, of, orbit, cycles, are, close, enough, to, integers, to, give, strong, similarity, for, eclipses, spaced, at, 18, 03, yr, intervals, an, eclipse, involving, the, sun, earth, and, moon, can, occur, only, when, they, are, nearly, in, a, straight, line, allowing, one, to, be, hidden, behind, another, viewed, from, the, third, because, the, orbital, plane, of, the, moon, is, tilted, with, respect, to, the, orbital, plane, of, the, earth, the, ecliptic, eclipses, can, occur, only, when, the, moon, is, close, to, the, intersection, of, these, two, planes, the, nodes, the, sun, earth, and, nodes, are, aligned, twice, a, year, during, an, eclipse, season, and, eclipses, can, occur, during, a, period, of, about, two, months, around, these, times, there, can, be, from, four, to, seven, eclipses, in, a, calendar, year, which, repeat, according, to, various, eclipse, cycles, such, as, a, saros, between, 1901, and, 2100, there, are, the, maximum, of, seven, eclipses, in, excluding, penumbral, lunar, eclipses, there, are, a, maximum, of, seven, eclipses, in, as, observed, from, the, earth, a, solar, eclipse, occurs, when, the, moon, passes, in, front, of, the, sun, the, type, of, solar, eclipse, event, depends, on, the, distance, of, the, moon, from, the, earth, during, the, event, a, total, solar, eclipse, occurs, when, the, earth, intersects, the, umbra, portion, of, the, moon, s, shadow, when, the, umbra, does, not, reach, the, surface, of, the, earth, the, sun, is, only, partially, occulted, resulting, in, an, annular, eclipse, partial, solar, eclipses, occur, when, the, viewer, is, inside, the, penumbra, the, eclipse, magnitude, is, the, fraction, of, the, sun, s, diameter, that, is, covered, by, the, moon, for, a, total, eclipse, this, value, is, always, greater, than, or, equal, to, one, in, both, annular, and, total, eclipses, the, eclipse, magnitude, is, the, ratio, of, the, angular, sizes, of, the, moon, to, the, sun, solar, eclipses, are, relatively, brief, events, that, can, only, be, viewed, in, totality, along, a, relatively, narrow, track, under, the, most, favorable, circumstances, a, total, solar, eclipse, can, last, for, 7, minutes, 31, seconds, and, can, be, viewed, along, a, track, that, is, up, to, 250, km, wide, however, the, region, where, a, partial, eclipse, can, be, observed, is, much, larger, the, moon, s, umbra, will, advance, eastward, at, a, rate, of, 1, 700, km, h, until, it, no, longer, intersects, the, earth, s, surface, during, a, solar, eclipse, the, moon, can, sometimes, perfectly, cover, the, sun, because, its, apparent, size, is, nearly, the, same, as, the, sun, s, when, viewed, from, the, earth, a, total, solar, eclipse, is, in, fact, an, occultation, while, an, annular, solar, eclipse, is, a, transit, when, observed, at, points, in, space, other, than, from, the, earth, s, surface, the, sun, can, be, eclipsed, by, bodies, other, than, the, moon, two, examples, include, when, the, crew, of, apollo, 12, observed, the, earth, to, eclipse, the, sun, in, 1969, and, when, the, cassini, probe, observed, saturn, to, eclipse, the, sun, in, 2006, lunar, eclipses, occur, when, the, moon, passes, through, the, earth, s, shadow, this, happens, only, during, a, full, moon, when, the, moon, is, on, the, far, side, of, the, earth, from, the, sun, unlike, a, solar, eclipse, an, eclipse, of, the, moon, can, be, observed, from, nearly, an, entire, hemisphere, for, this, reason, it, is, much, more, common, to, observe, a, lunar, eclipse, from, a, given, location, a, lunar, eclipse, lasts, longer, taking, several, hours, to, complete, with, totality, itself, usually, averaging, anywhere, from, about, 30, minutes, to, over, an, hour, there, are, three, types, of, lunar, eclipses, penumbral, when, the, moon, crosses, only, the, earth, s, penumbra, partial, when, the, moon, crosses, partially, into, the, earth, s, umbra, and, total, when, the, moon, crosses, entirely, into, the, earth, s, umbra, total, lunar, eclipses, pass, through, all, three, phases, even, during, a, total, lunar, eclipse, however, the, moon, is, not, completely, dark, sunlight, refracted, through, the, earth, s, atmosphere, enters, the, umbra, and, provides, a, faint, illumination, much, as, in, a, sunset, the, atmosphere, tends, to, more, strongly, scatter, light, with, shorter, wavelengths, so, the, illumination, of, the, moon, by, refracted, light, has, a, red, hue, thus, the, phrase, blood, moon, is, often, found, in, descriptions, of, such, lunar, events, as, far, back, as, eclipses, are, recorded, records, of, solar, eclipses, have, been, kept, since, ancient, times, eclipse, dates, can, be, used, for, chronological, dating, of, historical, records, a, syrian, clay, tablet, in, the, ugaritic, language, records, a, solar, eclipse, which, occurred, on, march, 5, 1223, b, c, while, paul, griffin, argues, that, a, stone, in, ireland, records, an, eclipse, on, november, 30, 3340, b, c, positing, classical, era, astronomers, use, of, babylonian, eclipse, records, mostly, from, the, 13th, century, bc, provides, a, feasible, and, mathematically, consistent, explanation, for, the, greek, finding, all, three, lunar, mean, motions, synodic, anomalistic, draconitic, to, a, precision, of, about, one, part, in, a, million, or, better, chinese, historical, records, of, solar, eclipses, date, back, over, 3, 000, years, and, have, been, used, to, measure, changes, in, the, earth, s, rate, of, spin, the, first, person, to, give, scientific, explanation, on, eclipses, was, anaxagoras, anaxagoras, stated, that, the, moon, shines, by, reflected, light, from, the, sun, in, 5th, century, ad, solar, and, lunar, eclipses, were, scientifically, explained, by, aryabhata, in, his, treatise, aryabhatiya, aryabhata, states, that, the, moon, and, planets, shine, by, reflected, sunlight, and, explains, eclipses, in, terms, of, shadows, cast, by, and, falling, on, earth, aryabhata, provides, the, computation, and, the, size, of, the, eclipsed, part, during, an, eclipse, indian, computations, were, very, accurate, that, 18th, century, french, scientist, guillaume, le, gentil, during, a, visit, to, pondicherry, india, found, the, indian, computations, of, the, duration, of, the, lunar, eclipse, of, 30, august, 1765, to, be, short, by, only, 41, seconds, whereas, le, gentil, s, charts, were, long, by, 68, seconds, by, the, 1600s, european, astronomers, were, publishing, books, with, diagrams, explaining, how, lunar, and, solar, eclipses, occurred, in, order, to, disseminate, this, information, to, a, broader, audience, and, decrease, fear, of, the, consequences, of, eclipses, booksellers, printed, broadsides, explaining, the, event, either, using, the, science, or, via, astrology, the, american, author, gene, weingarten, described, the, tension, between, belief, and, eclipses, thus, i, am, a, devout, atheist, but, can, t, explain, why, the, moon, is, exactly, the, right, size, and, gets, positioned, so, precisely, between, the, earth, and, the, sun, that, total, solar, eclipses, are, perfect, it, bothers, me, the, graeco, roman, historian, cassius, dio, writing, between, ad, 211, 229, relates, the, anecdote, that, emperor, claudius, considered, it, necessary, to, prevent, disturbance, among, the, roman, population, by, publishing, a, prediction, for, a, solar, eclipse, which, would, fall, on, his, birthday, anniversary, in, this, context, cassius, dio, provides, a, detailed, explanation, of, solar, and, lunar, eclipses, typically, in, mythology, eclipses, were, understood, to, be, one, variation, or, another, of, a, spiritual, battle, between, the, sun, and, evil, forces, or, spirits, of, darkness, more, specifically, in, norse, mythology, it, is, believed, that, there, is, a, wolf, by, the, name, of, fenrir, that, is, in, constant, pursuit, of, the, sun, and, eclipses, are, thought, to, occur, when, the, wolf, successfully, devours, the, divine, sun, other, norse, tribes, believe, that, there, are, two, wolves, by, the, names, of, sk, ll, and, hati, that, are, in, pursuit, of, the, sun, and, the, moon, known, by, the, names, of, sol, and, mani, and, these, tribes, believe, that, an, eclipse, occurs, when, one, of, the, wolves, successfully, eats, either, the, sun, or, the, moon, in, most, types, of, mythologies, and, certain, religions, eclipses, were, seen, as, a, sign, that, the, gods, were, angry, and, that, danger, was, soon, to, come, so, people, often, altered, their, actions, in, an, effort, to, dissuade, the, gods, from, unleashing, their, wrath, in, the, hindu, religion, for, example, people, often, sing, religious, hymns, for, protection, from, the, evil, spirits, of, the, eclipse, and, many, people, of, the, hindu, religion, refuse, to, eat, during, an, eclipse, to, avoid, the, effects, of, the, evil, spirits, hindu, people, living, in, india, will, also, wash, off, in, the, ganges, river, which, is, believed, to, be, spiritually, cleansing, directly, following, an, eclipse, to, clean, themselves, of, the, evil, spirits, in, early, judaism, and, christianity, eclipses, were, viewed, as, signs, from, god, and, some, eclipses, were, seen, as, a, display, of, god, s, greatness, or, even, signs, of, cycles, of, life, and, death, however, more, ominous, eclipses, such, as, a, blood, moon, were, believed, to, be, a, divine, sign, that, god, would, soon, destroy, their, enemies, the, gas, giant, planets, have, many, moons, and, thus, frequently, display, eclipses, the, most, striking, involve, jupiter, which, has, four, large, moons, and, a, low, axial, tilt, making, eclipses, more, frequent, as, these, bodies, pass, through, the, shadow, of, the, larger, planet, transits, occur, with, equal, frequency, it, is, common, to, see, the, larger, moons, casting, circular, shadows, upon, jupiter, s, cloudtops, the, eclipses, of, the, galilean, moons, by, jupiter, became, accurately, predictable, once, their, orbital, elements, were, known, during, the, 1670s, it, was, discovered, that, these, events, were, occurring, about, 17, minutes, later, than, expected, when, jupiter, was, on, the, far, side, of, the, sun, ole, r, mer, deduced, that, the, delay, was, caused, by, the, time, needed, for, light, to, travel, from, jupiter, to, the, earth, this, was, used, to, produce, the, first, estimate, of, the, speed, of, light, the, timing, of, the, jovian, satellite, eclipses, was, also, used, to, calculate, an, observer, s, longitude, upon, the, earth, by, knowing, the, expected, time, when, an, eclipse, would, be, observed, at, a, standard, longitude, such, as, greenwich, the, time, difference, could, be, computed, by, accurately, observing, the, local, time, of, the, eclipse, the, time, difference, gives, the, longitude, of, the, observer, because, every, hour, of, difference, corresponded, to, 15, around, the, earth, s, equator, this, technique, was, used, for, example, by, giovanni, d, cassini, in, 1679, to, re, map, france, on, the, other, three, gas, giants, saturn, uranus, and, neptune, eclipses, only, occur, at, certain, periods, during, the, planet, s, orbit, due, to, their, higher, inclination, between, the, orbits, of, the, moon, and, the, orbital, plane, of, the, planet, the, moon, titan, for, example, has, an, orbital, plane, tilted, about, 1, 6, to, saturn, s, equatorial, plane, but, saturn, has, an, axial, tilt, of, nearly, 27, the, orbital, plane, of, titan, only, crosses, the, line, of, sight, to, the, sun, at, two, points, along, saturn, s, orbit, as, the, orbital, period, of, saturn, is, 29, 7, years, an, eclipse, is, only, possible, about, every, 15, years, on, mars, only, partial, solar, eclipses, transits, are, possible, because, neither, of, its, moons, is, large, enough, at, their, respective, orbital, radii, to, cover, the, sun, s, disc, as, seen, from, the, surface, of, the, planet, eclipses, of, the, moons, by, mars, are, not, only, possible, but, commonplace, with, hundreds, occurring, each, earth, year, there, are, also, rare, occasions, when, deimos, is, eclipsed, by, phobos, martian, eclipses, have, been, photographed, from, both, the, surface, of, mars, and, from, orbit, pluto, with, its, proportionately, largest, moon, charon, is, also, the, site, of, many, eclipses, a, series, of, such, mutual, eclipses, occurred, between, 1985, and, 1990, these, daily, events, led, to, the, first, accurate, measurements, of, the, physical, parameters, of, both, objects, eclipses, are, impossible, on, mercury, and, venus, which, have, no, moons, however, as, seen, from, the, earth, both, have, been, observed, to, transit, across, the, face, of, the, sun, transits, of, venus, occur, in, pairs, separated, by, an, interval, of, eight, years, but, each, pair, of, events, happen, less, than, once, a, century, according, to, nasa, the, next, pair, of, venus, transits, will, occur, on, december, 10, 2117, and, december, 8, 2125, transits, of, mercury, are, much, more, common, occurring, 13, times, each, century, on, average, a, binary, star, system, consists, of, two, stars, that, orbit, around, their, common, centre, of, mass, the, movements, of, both, stars, lie, on, a, common, orbital, plane, in, space, when, this, plane, is, very, closely, aligned, with, the, location, of, an, observer, the, stars, can, be, seen, to, pass, in, front, of, each, other, the, result, is, a, type, of, extrinsic, variable, star, system, called, an, eclipsing, binary, the, maximum, luminosity, of, an, eclipsing, binary, system, is, equal, to, the, sum, of, the, luminosity, contributions, from, the, individual, stars, when, one, star, passes, in, front, of, the, other, the, luminosity, of, the, system, is, seen, to, decrease, the, luminosity, returns, to, normal, once, the, two, stars, are, no, longer, in, alignment, the, first, eclipsing, binary, star, system, to, be, discovered, was, algol, a, star, system, in, the, constellation, perseus, normally, this, star, system, has, a, visual, magnitude, of, 2, 1, however, every, 2, 867, days, the, magnitude, decreases, to, 3, 4, for, more, than, nine, hours, this, is, caused, by, the, passage, of, the, dimmer, member, of, the, pair, in, front, of, the, brighter, star, the, concept, that, an, eclipsing, body, caused, these, luminosity, variations, was, introduced, by, john, goodricke, in, 1783, sun, moon,
