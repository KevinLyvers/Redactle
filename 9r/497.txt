nylon, is, a, family, of, synthetic, polymers, with, amide, backbones, usually, linking, aliphatic, or, semi, aromatic, groups, nylons, are, white, or, colorless, and, soft, some, are, silk, like, they, are, thermoplastic, which, means, that, they, can, be, melt, processed, into, fibers, films, and, diverse, shapes, 2, the, properties, of, nylons, are, often, modified, by, blending, with, a, wide, variety, of, additives, many, kinds, of, nylon, are, known, one, family, designated, nylon, xy, is, derived, from, diamines, and, dicarboxylic, acids, of, carbon, chain, lengths, x, and, y, respectively, an, important, example, is, nylon, 6, 6, c, h, n, o, another, family, designated, nylon, z, is, derived, from, aminocarboxylic, acids, with, carbon, chain, length, z, an, example, is, nylon, nylon, polymers, have, significant, commercial, applications, in, fabric, and, fibers, apparel, flooring, and, rubber, reinforcement, in, shapes, molded, parts, for, cars, electrical, equipment, etc, and, in, films, mostly, for, food, packaging, researchers, at, dupont, began, developing, cellulose, based, fibers, culminating, in, the, synthetic, fiber, rayon, dupont, s, experience, with, rayon, was, an, important, precursor, to, its, development, and, marketing, of, nylon, 8, 64, 236, dupont, s, invention, of, nylon, spanned, an, eleven, year, period, ranging, from, the, initial, research, program, in, polymers, in, 1927, to, its, announcement, in, 1938, shortly, before, the, opening, of, the, 1939, new, york, world, s, fair, the, project, grew, from, a, new, organizational, structure, at, dupont, suggested, by, charles, stine, in, 1927, in, which, the, chemical, department, would, be, composed, of, several, small, research, teams, that, would, focus, on, pioneering, research, in, chemistry, and, would, lead, to, practical, applications, 92, harvard, instructor, wallace, hume, carothers, was, hired, to, direct, the, polymer, research, group, initially, he, was, allowed, to, focus, on, pure, research, building, on, and, testing, the, theories, of, german, chemist, hermann, staudinger, he, was, very, successful, as, research, he, undertook, greatly, improved, the, knowledge, of, polymers, and, contributed, to, the, science, nylon, was, the, first, commercially, successful, synthetic, thermoplastic, polymer, dupont, began, its, research, project, in, 1927, the, first, nylon, nylon, 66, was, synthesized, on, february, 28, 1935, by, wallace, hume, carothers, at, dupont, s, research, facility, at, the, dupont, experimental, station, in, response, to, carothers, work, paul, schlack, at, ig, farben, developed, nylon, 6, a, different, molecule, based, on, caprolactam, on, january, 29, 1938, 10, in, the, spring, of, 1930, carothers, and, his, team, had, already, synthesized, two, new, polymers, one, was, neoprene, a, synthetic, rubber, greatly, used, during, world, war, ii, the, other, was, a, white, elastic, but, strong, paste, that, would, later, become, nylon, after, these, discoveries, carothers, team, was, made, to, shift, its, research, from, a, more, pure, research, approach, investigating, general, polymerization, to, a, more, practically, focused, goal, of, finding, one, chemical, combination, that, would, lend, itself, to, industrial, applications, 94, it, was, not, until, the, beginning, of, 1935, that, a, polymer, called, polymer, 6, 6, was, finally, produced, carothers, coworker, washington, university, alumnus, julian, w, hill, had, used, a, cold, drawing, method, to, produce, a, polyester, in, 1930, this, cold, drawing, method, was, later, used, by, carothers, in, 1935, to, fully, develop, nylon, the, first, example, of, nylon, nylon, 6, 6, was, produced, on, february, 28, 1935, at, dupont, s, research, facility, at, the, dupont, experimental, station, it, had, all, the, desired, properties, of, elasticity, and, strength, however, it, also, required, a, complex, manufacturing, process, that, would, become, the, basis, of, industrial, production, in, the, future, dupont, obtained, a, patent, for, the, polymer, in, september, 1938, and, quickly, achieved, a, monopoly, of, the, fiber, carothers, died, 16, months, before, the, announcement, of, nylon, therefore, he, was, never, able, to, see, his, success, nylon, was, first, used, commercially, in, a, nylon, bristled, toothbrush, in, 1938, followed, more, famously, in, women, s, stockings, or, nylons, which, were, shown, at, the, 1939, new, york, world, s, fair, and, first, sold, commercially, in, 1940, whereupon, they, became, an, instant, commercial, success, with, 64, million, pairs, sold, during, their, first, year, on, the, market, during, world, war, ii, almost, all, nylon, production, was, diverted, to, the, military, for, use, in, parachutes, and, parachute, cord, wartime, uses, of, nylon, and, other, plastics, greatly, increased, the, market, for, the, new, materials, the, production, of, nylon, required, interdepartmental, collaboration, between, three, departments, at, dupont, the, department, of, chemical, research, the, ammonia, department, and, the, department, of, rayon, some, of, the, key, ingredients, of, nylon, had, to, be, produced, using, high, pressure, chemistry, the, main, area, of, expertise, of, the, ammonia, department, nylon, was, considered, a, godsend, to, the, ammonia, department, which, had, been, in, financial, difficulties, the, reactants, of, nylon, soon, constituted, half, of, the, ammonia, department, s, sales, and, helped, them, come, out, of, the, period, of, the, great, depression, by, creating, jobs, and, revenue, at, dupont, dupont, s, nylon, project, demonstrated, the, importance, of, chemical, engineering, in, industry, helped, create, jobs, and, furthered, the, advancement, of, chemical, engineering, techniques, in, fact, it, developed, a, chemical, plant, that, provided, 1800, jobs, and, used, the, latest, technologies, of, the, time, which, are, still, used, as, a, model, for, chemical, plants, today, the, ability, to, acquire, a, large, number, of, chemists, and, engineers, quickly, was, a, huge, contribution, to, the, success, of, dupont, s, nylon, project, 100, 101, the, first, nylon, plant, was, located, at, seaford, delaware, beginning, commercial, production, on, december, 15, 1939, on, october, 26, 1995, the, seaford, plant, was, designated, a, national, historic, chemical, landmark, by, the, american, chemical, society, an, important, part, of, nylon, s, popularity, stems, from, dupont, s, marketing, strategy, dupont, promoted, the, fiber, to, increase, demand, before, the, product, was, available, to, the, general, market, nylon, s, commercial, announcement, occurred, on, october, 27, 1938, at, the, final, session, of, the, herald, tribune, s, yearly, forum, on, current, problems, on, the, site, of, the, approaching, new, york, city, world, s, fair, 141, the, first, man, made, organic, textile, fiber, which, was, derived, from, coal, water, and, air, and, promised, to, be, as, strong, as, steel, as, fine, as, the, spider, s, web, was, received, enthusiastically, by, the, audience, many, of, them, middle, class, women, and, made, the, headlines, of, most, newspapers, 141, nylon, was, introduced, as, part, of, the, world, of, tomorrow, at, the, 1939, new, york, world, s, fair, and, was, featured, at, dupont, s, wonder, world, of, chemistry, at, the, golden, gate, international, exposition, in, san, francisco, in, 1939, actual, nylon, stockings, were, not, shipped, to, selected, stores, in, the, national, market, until, may, 15, 1940, however, a, limited, number, were, released, for, sale, in, delaware, before, that, 145, 146, the, first, public, sale, of, nylon, stockings, occurred, on, october, 24, 1939, in, wilmington, delaware, 4, 000, pairs, of, stockings, were, available, all, of, which, were, sold, within, three, hours, another, added, bonus, to, the, campaign, was, that, it, meant, reducing, silk, imports, from, japan, an, argument, that, won, over, many, wary, customers, nylon, was, even, mentioned, by, president, roosevelt, s, cabinet, which, addressed, its, vast, and, interesting, economic, possibilities, five, days, after, the, material, was, formally, announced, however, the, early, excitement, over, nylon, also, caused, problems, it, fueled, unreasonable, expectations, that, nylon, would, be, better, than, silk, a, miracle, fabric, as, strong, as, steel, that, would, last, forever, and, never, run, 145, 147, realizing, the, danger, of, claims, such, as, new, hosiery, held, strong, as, steel, and, no, more, runs, dupont, scaled, back, the, terms, of, the, original, announcement, especially, those, stating, that, nylon, would, possess, the, strength, of, steel, also, dupont, executives, marketing, nylon, as, a, revolutionary, man, made, material, did, not, at, first, realize, that, some, consumers, experienced, a, sense, of, unease, and, distrust, even, fear, towards, synthetic, fabrics, 126, 128, a, particularly, damaging, news, story, drawing, on, dupont, s, 1938, patent, for, the, new, polymer, suggested, that, one, method, of, producing, nylon, might, be, to, use, cadaverine, pentamethylenediamine, a, chemical, extracted, from, corpses, although, scientists, asserted, that, cadaverine, was, also, extracted, by, heating, coal, the, public, often, refused, to, listen, a, woman, confronted, one, of, the, lead, scientists, at, dupont, and, refused, to, accept, that, the, rumour, was, not, true, 146, 147, dupont, changed, its, campaign, strategy, emphasizing, that, nylon, was, made, from, coal, air, and, water, and, started, focusing, on, the, personal, and, aesthetic, aspects, of, nylon, rather, than, its, intrinsic, qualities, 146, 147, nylon, was, thus, domesticated, 151, 152, and, attention, shifted, to, the, material, and, consumer, aspect, of, the, fiber, with, slogans, like, if, it, s, nylon, it, s, prettier, and, oh, how, fast, it, dries, 2, after, nylon, s, nationwide, release, in, 1940, its, production, ramped, up, significantly, in, that, year, alone, 1300, tons, of, the, fabric, were, produced, marking, a, remarkable, start, for, this, innovative, material, 100, the, demand, for, nylon, surged, particularly, for, nylon, stockings, which, became, an, instant, sensation, during, their, first, year, on, the, market, an, astounding, 64, million, pairs, of, nylon, stockings, were, sold, reflecting, the, fabric, s, rapid, integration, into, daily, life, and, fashion, 101, such, was, the, success, of, nylon, that, in, 1941, just, a, year, after, its, launch, a, second, plant, was, opened, in, martinsville, virginia, to, meet, the, growing, demand, and, ensure, a, steady, supply, of, this, popular, fabric, this, expansion, underscored, the, profound, impact, nylon, had, on, the, textile, industry, and, its, rapid, rise, to, prominence, as, a, versatile, and, sought, after, material, while, nylon, was, marketed, as, the, durable, and, indestructible, material, of, the, people, it, was, sold, at, about, one, and, a, half, times, the, price, of, silk, stockings, 4, 27, per, pound, of, nylon, versus, 2, 79, per, pound, of, silk, 101, sales, of, nylon, stockings, were, strong, in, part, due, to, changes, in, women, s, fashion, as, lauren, olds, explains, by, 1939, had, inched, back, up, to, the, knee, closing, the, decade, just, as, it, started, off, the, shorter, skirts, were, accompanied, by, a, demand, for, stockings, that, offered, fuller, coverage, without, the, use, of, garters, to, hold, them, up, however, as, of, february, 11, 1942, nylon, production, was, redirected, from, being, a, consumer, material, to, one, used, by, the, military, dupont, s, production, of, nylon, stockings, and, other, lingerie, stopped, and, most, manufactured, nylon, was, used, to, make, parachutes, and, tents, for, world, war, ii, although, nylon, stockings, already, made, before, the, war, could, be, purchased, they, were, generally, sold, on, the, black, market, for, as, high, as, 20, once, the, war, ended, the, return, of, nylon, was, awaited, with, great, anticipation, although, dupont, projected, yearly, production, of, 360, million, pairs, of, stockings, there, were, delays, in, converting, back, to, consumer, rather, than, wartime, production, in, 1946, the, demand, for, nylon, stockings, could, not, be, satisfied, which, led, to, the, nylon, riots, in, one, instance, an, estimated, 40, 000, people, lined, up, in, pittsburgh, to, buy, 13, 000, pairs, of, nylons, in, the, meantime, women, cut, up, nylon, tents, and, parachutes, left, from, the, war, in, order, to, make, blouses, and, wedding, dresses, between, the, end, of, the, war, and, 1952, production, of, stockings, and, lingerie, used, 80, of, the, world, s, nylon, dupont, put, focus, on, catering, to, the, civilian, demand, and, continually, expanded, its, production, as, pure, nylon, hosiery, was, sold, in, a, wider, market, problems, became, apparent, nylon, stockings, were, found, to, be, fragile, in, the, sense, that, the, thread, often, tended, to, unravel, lengthwise, creating, runs, 101, people, also, reported, that, pure, nylon, textiles, could, be, uncomfortable, due, to, nylon, s, lack, of, absorbency, moisture, stayed, inside, the, fabric, near, the, skin, under, hot, or, moist, conditions, instead, of, being, wicked, away, nylon, fabric, could, also, be, itchy, and, tended, to, cling, and, sometimes, spark, as, a, result, of, static, electrical, charge, built, up, by, friction, also, under, some, conditions, stockings, could, decompose, turning, back, into, nylon, s, original, components, of, air, coal, and, water, scientists, explained, this, as, a, result, of, air, pollution, attributing, it, to, london, smog, in, 1952, as, well, as, poor, air, quality, in, new, york, and, los, angeles, the, solution, found, to, problems, with, pure, nylon, fabric, was, to, blend, nylon, with, other, existing, fibers, or, polymers, such, as, cotton, polyester, and, spandex, this, led, to, the, development, of, a, wide, array, of, blended, fabrics, the, new, nylon, blends, retained, the, desirable, properties, of, nylon, elasticity, durability, ability, to, be, dyed, and, kept, clothes, prices, low, and, affordable, 2, as, of, 1950, the, new, york, quartermaster, procurement, agency, nyqmpa, which, developed, and, tested, textiles, for, the, army, and, navy, had, committed, to, developing, a, wool, nylon, blend, they, were, not, the, only, ones, to, introduce, blends, of, both, natural, and, synthetic, fibers, america, s, textile, reporter, referred, to, 1951, as, the, year, of, the, blending, of, the, fibers, fabric, blends, included, mixes, like, bunara, wool, rabbit, nylon, and, casmet, wool, nylon, fur, in, britain, in, november, 1951, the, inaugural, address, of, the, 198th, session, of, the, royal, society, for, the, encouragement, of, arts, manufactures, and, commerce, focused, on, the, blending, of, textiles, dupont, s, fabric, development, department, cleverly, targeted, french, fashion, designers, supplying, them, with, fabric, samples, in, 1955, designers, such, as, coco, chanel, jean, patou, and, christian, dior, showed, gowns, created, with, dupont, fibers, and, fashion, photographer, horst, p, horst, was, hired, to, document, their, use, of, dupont, fabrics, american, fabrics, credited, blends, with, providing, creative, possibilities, and, new, ideas, for, fashions, which, had, been, hitherto, undreamed, of, dupont, went, through, an, extensive, process, to, generate, names, for, its, new, product, 138, 139, in, 1940, john, w, eckelberry, of, dupont, stated, that, the, letters, nyl, were, arbitrary, and, the, on, was, copied, from, the, suffixes, of, other, fibers, such, as, cotton, and, rayon, a, later, publication, by, dupont, context, vol, 7, no, 2, 1978, explained, that, the, name, was, originally, intended, to, be, no, run, run, meaning, unravel, but, was, modified, to, avoid, making, such, an, unjustified, claim, since, the, products, were, not, really, run, proof, the, vowels, were, swapped, to, produce, nuron, which, was, changed, to, nilon, to, make, it, sound, less, like, a, nerve, tonic, for, clarity, in, pronunciation, the, i, was, changed, to, y, a, persistent, urban, legend, exists, that, the, name, is, derived, from, new, york, and, london, however, no, organisation, in, london, was, ever, involved, in, the, research, and, production, of, nylon, nylon, s, popularity, soared, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, due, to, its, durability, and, sheerness, in, the, 1970s, it, became, more, popular, due, to, its, flexibility, and, price, in, spite, of, oil, shortages, in, the, 1970s, consumption, of, nylon, textiles, continued, to, grow, by, 7, 5, per, year, between, the, 1960s, and, 1980s, overall, production, of, synthetic, fibers, however, dropped, from, 63, of, the, worlds, textile, production, in, 1965, to, 45, of, the, world, s, textile, production, in, early, 1970s, the, appeal, of, new, technologies, wore, off, and, nylon, fabric, was, going, out, of, style, in, the, 1970s, also, consumers, became, concerned, about, environmental, costs, throughout, the, production, cycle, obtaining, the, raw, materials, oil, energy, use, during, production, waste, produced, during, creation, of, the, fiber, and, eventual, waste, disposal, of, materials, that, were, not, biodegradable, synthetic, fibers, have, not, dominated, the, market, since, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, as, of, 2020, the, worldwide, production, of, nylon, is, estimated, at, 8, 9, million, tons, although, pure, nylon, has, many, flaws, and, is, now, rarely, used, its, derivatives, have, greatly, influenced, and, contributed, to, society, from, scientific, discoveries, relating, to, the, production, of, plastics, and, polymerization, to, economic, impact, during, the, depression, and, the, changing, of, women, s, fashion, nylon, was, a, revolutionary, product, the, lunar, flag, assembly, the, first, flag, planted, on, the, moon, in, a, symbolic, gesture, of, celebration, was, made, of, nylon, the, flag, itself, cost, 5, 50, but, had, to, have, a, specially, designed, flagpole, with, a, horizontal, bar, so, that, it, would, appear, to, fly, one, historian, describes, nylon, as, an, object, of, desire, comparing, the, invention, to, coca, cola, in, the, eyes, of, 20th, century, consumers, in, common, usage, the, prefix, pa, polyamide, or, the, name, nylon, are, used, interchangeably, and, are, equivalent, in, meaning, the, nomenclature, used, for, nylon, polymers, was, devised, during, the, synthesis, of, the, first, simple, aliphatic, nylons, and, uses, numbers, to, describe, the, number, of, carbons, in, each, monomer, unit, including, the, carbon, s, of, the, carboxylic, acid, s, subsequent, use, of, cyclic, and, aromatic, monomers, required, the, use, of, letters, or, sets, of, letters, one, number, after, pa, or, nylon, indicates, a, homopolymer, which, is, monadic, or, based, on, one, amino, acid, minus, h, 2, o, as, monomer, two, numbers, or, sets, of, letters, indicate, a, dyadic, homopolymer, formed, from, two, monomers, one, diamine, and, one, dicarboxylic, acid, the, first, number, indicates, the, number, of, carbons, in, the, diamine, the, two, numbers, should, be, separated, by, a, comma, for, clarity, but, the, comma, is, often, omitted, for, copolymers, the, comonomers, or, pairs, of, comonomers, are, separated, by, slashes, the, term, polyphthalamide, abbreviated, to, ppa, is, used, when, 60, or, more, moles, of, the, carboxylic, acid, portion, of, the, repeating, unit, in, the, polymer, chain, is, composed, of, a, combination, of, terephthalic, acid, tpa, and, isophthalic, acid, ipa, nylon, 66, and, related, polyamides, are, condensation, polymers, forms, from, equal, parts, of, diamine, and, dicarboxylic, acids, in, the, first, case, the, repeating, unit, has, the, abab, structure, as, also, seen, in, many, polyesters, and, polyurethanes, since, each, monomer, in, this, copolymer, has, the, same, reactive, group, on, both, ends, the, direction, of, the, amide, bond, reverses, between, each, monomer, unlike, natural, polyamide, proteins, which, have, overall, directionality, c, terminal, n, terminal, in, the, second, case, so, called, aa, the, repeating, unit, corresponds, to, the, single, monomer, 45, 50, wallace, carothers, at, dupont, patented, nylon, 66, in, the, case, of, nylons, that, involve, reaction, of, a, diamine, and, a, dicarboxylic, acid, it, is, difficult, to, get, the, proportions, exactly, correct, and, deviations, can, lead, to, chain, termination, at, molecular, weights, less, than, a, desirable, 10, 000, daltons, u, to, overcome, this, problem, a, crystalline, solid, nylon, salt, can, be, formed, at, room, temperature, using, an, exact, 1, 1, ratio, of, the, acid, and, the, base, to, neutralize, each, other, the, salt, is, crystallized, to, purify, it, and, obtain, the, desired, precise, stoichiometry, heated, to, 285, c, 545, f, the, salt, reacts, to, form, nylon, polymer, with, the, production, of, water, nylon, 510, made, from, pentamethylene, diamine, and, sebacic, acid, was, included, in, the, carothers, patent, to, nylon, 66, nylon, 610, is, produced, similarly, using, hexamethylene, diamine, these, materials, are, more, expensive, because, of, the, relatively, high, cost, of, sebacic, acid, owing, to, the, high, hydrocarbon, content, nylon, 610, is, more, hydrophobic, and, finds, applications, suited, for, this, property, such, as, bristles, examples, of, these, polymers, that, are, or, were, commercially, available, these, polymers, are, made, from, a, lactam, or, amino, acid, the, synthetic, route, using, lactams, cyclic, amides, was, developed, by, paul, schlack, at, ig, farben, leading, to, nylon, 6, or, polycaprolactam, formed, by, a, ring, opening, polymerization, the, peptide, bond, within, the, caprolactam, is, broken, with, the, exposed, active, groups, on, each, side, being, incorporated, into, two, new, bonds, as, the, monomer, becomes, part, of, the, polymer, backbone, the, 428, f, 220, c, melting, point, of, nylon, 6, is, lower, than, the, 509, f, 265, c, melting, point, of, nylon, 66, homopolymer, nylons, are, derived, from, one, monomer, examples, of, these, polymers, that, are, or, were, commercially, available, nylons, can, also, be, synthesized, from, dinitriles, using, acid, catalysis, for, example, this, method, is, applicable, for, preparation, of, nylon, 1, 6, from, adiponitrile, formaldehyde, and, water, additionally, nylons, can, be, synthesized, from, diols, and, dinitriles, using, this, method, as, well, it, is, easy, to, make, mixtures, of, the, monomers, or, sets, of, monomers, used, to, make, nylons, to, obtain, copolymers, this, lowers, crystallinity, and, can, therefore, lower, the, melting, point, some, copolymers, that, have, been, or, are, commercially, available, are, listed, below, most, nylon, polymers, are, miscible, with, each, other, allowing, a, range, of, blends, to, be, made, the, two, polymers, can, react, with, one, another, by, transamidation, to, form, random, copolymers, according, to, their, crystallinity, polyamides, can, be, according, to, this, classification, pa66, for, example, is, an, aliphatic, semi, crystalline, homopolyamide, all, nylons, are, susceptible, to, hydrolysis, especially, by, strong, acids, a, reaction, essentially, the, reverse, of, their, synthesis, the, molecular, weight, of, nylon, products, so, attacked, drops, and, cracks, form, quickly, at, the, affected, zones, lower, members, of, the, nylons, such, as, nylon, 6, are, affected, more, than, higher, members, such, as, nylon, 12, this, means, that, nylon, parts, cannot, be, used, in, contact, with, sulfuric, acid, for, example, such, as, the, electrolyte, used, in, lead, acid, batteries, when, being, molded, nylon, must, be, dried, to, prevent, hydrolysis, in, the, molding, machine, barrel, since, water, at, high, temperatures, can, also, degrade, the, polymer, the, reaction, is, shown, above, the, average, greenhouse, gas, footprint, of, nylon, in, manufacturing, carpets, is, estimated, at, 5, 43, kg, co, 2, equivalent, per, kg, when, produced, in, europe, this, gives, it, almost, the, same, carbon, footprint, as, wool, but, with, greater, durability, and, therefore, a, lower, overall, carbon, footprint, data, published, by, plasticseurope, indicates, for, nylon, 66, a, greenhouse, gas, footprint, of, 6, 4, kg, co, 2, equivalent, per, kg, and, an, energy, consumption, of, 138, kj, kg, when, considering, the, environmental, impact, of, nylon, it, is, important, to, consider, the, use, phase, various, nylons, break, down, in, fire, and, form, hazardous, smoke, and, toxic, fumes, or, ash, typically, containing, hydrogen, cyanide, incinerating, nylons, to, recover, the, high, energy, used, to, create, them, is, usually, expensive, so, most, nylons, reach, the, garbage, dumps, decaying, slowly, discarded, nylon, fabric, takes, 30, 40, years, to, decompose, nylon, used, in, discarded, fishing, gear, such, as, fishing, nets, is, a, contributor, to, debris, in, the, ocean, nylon, is, a, robust, polymer, and, lends, itself, well, to, recycling, much, nylon, resin, is, recycled, directly, in, a, closed, loop, at, the, injection, molding, machine, by, grinding, sprues, and, runners, and, mixing, them, with, the, virgin, granules, being, consumed, by, the, molding, machine, because, of, the, expense, and, difficulties, of, the, nylon, recycling, process, few, companies, utilize, it, while, most, favor, using, cheaper, newly, made, plastics, for, their, products, instead, us, clothing, company, patagonia, has, products, containing, recycled, nylon, and, in, the, mid, 2010s, invested, in, bureo, a, company, that, recycles, nylon, from, used, fishing, nets, to, use, in, sunglasses, and, skateboards, the, italian, company, aquafil, also, has, demonstrated, recycling, fishing, nets, lost, in, the, ocean, into, apparel, vanden, recycling, recycles, nylon, and, other, polyamides, pa, and, has, operations, in, the, uk, australia, hong, kong, the, uae, turkey, and, finland, nylon, is, the, most, popular, fiber, type, in, the, residential, carpet, industry, today, the, us, epa, estimates, that, 9, 2, of, carpet, fiber, backing, and, padding, was, recycled, in, 2018, 17, 8, was, incinerated, in, waste, to, energy, facilities, and, 73, was, discarded, in, landfills, some, of, the, world, s, largest, carpet, and, rug, companies, are, promoting, cradle, to, cradle, the, re, use, of, non, virgin, materials, including, ones, not, historically, recycled, as, the, industry, s, pathway, forward, above, their, melting, temperatures, t, m, thermoplastics, like, nylon, are, amorphous, solids, or, viscous, fluids, in, which, the, chains, approximate, random, coils, below, t, m, amorphous, regions, alternate, with, regions, which, are, lamellar, crystals, the, amorphous, regions, contribute, elasticity, and, the, crystalline, regions, contribute, strength, and, rigidity, the, planar, amide, co, nh, groups, are, very, polar, so, nylon, forms, multiple, hydrogen, bonds, among, adjacent, strands, because, the, nylon, backbone, is, so, regular, and, symmetrical, especially, if, all, the, amide, bonds, are, in, the, trans, configuration, nylons, often, have, high, crystallinity, and, make, excellent, fibers, the, amount, of, crystallinity, depends, on, the, details, of, formation, as, well, as, on, the, kind, of, nylon, nylon, 66, can, have, multiple, parallel, strands, aligned, with, their, neighboring, peptide, bonds, at, coordinated, separations, of, exactly, six, and, four, carbons, for, considerable, lengths, so, the, carbonyl, oxygens, and, amide, hydrogens, can, line, up, to, form, interchain, hydrogen, bonds, repeatedly, without, interruption, see, the, figure, opposite, nylon, 510, can, have, coordinated, runs, of, five, and, eight, carbons, thus, parallel, but, not, antiparallel, strands, can, participate, in, extended, unbroken, multi, chain, pleated, sheets, a, strong, and, tough, supermolecular, structure, similar, to, that, found, in, natural, silk, fibroin, and, the, keratins, in, feathers, proteins, have, only, an, amino, acid, carbon, separating, sequential, co, nh, groups, nylon, 6, will, form, uninterrupted, h, bonded, sheets, with, mixed, directionalities, but, the, sheet, wrinkling, is, somewhat, different, the, three, dimensional, disposition, of, each, alkane, hydrocarbon, chain, depends, on, rotations, about, the, 109, 47, tetrahedral, bonds, of, singly, bonded, carbon, atoms, when, extruded, into, fibers, through, pores, in, an, industry, spinneret, the, individual, polymer, chains, tend, to, align, because, of, viscous, flow, if, subjected, to, cold, drawing, afterwards, the, fibers, align, further, increasing, their, crystallinity, and, the, material, acquires, additional, tensile, strength, in, practice, nylon, fibers, are, most, often, drawn, using, heated, rolls, at, high, speeds, block, nylon, tends, to, be, less, crystalline, except, near, the, surfaces, due, to, shearing, stresses, during, formation, nylon, is, clear, and, colorless, or, milky, but, is, easily, dyed, multistranded, nylon, cord, and, rope, is, slippery, and, tends, to, unravel, the, ends, can, be, melted, and, fused, with, a, heat, source, such, as, a, flame, or, electrode, to, prevent, this, nylons, are, hygroscopic, and, will, absorb, or, desorb, moisture, as, a, function, of, the, ambient, humidity, variations, in, moisture, content, have, several, effects, on, the, polymer, firstly, the, dimensions, will, change, but, more, importantly, moisture, acts, as, a, plasticizer, lowering, the, glass, transition, temperature, t, g, and, consequently, the, elastic, modulus, at, temperatures, below, the, t, g, when, dry, polyamide, is, a, good, electrical, insulator, however, polyamide, is, hygroscopic, the, absorption, of, water, will, change, some, of, the, material, s, properties, such, as, its, electrical, resistance, nylon, is, less, absorbent, than, wool, or, cotton, the, characteristic, features, of, nylon, 66, include, on, the, other, hand, nylon, 6, is, easy, to, dye, more, readily, fades, it, has, a, higher, impact, resistance, a, more, rapid, moisture, absorption, greater, elasticity, and, elastic, recovery, nylon, clothing, tends, to, be, less, flammable, than, cotton, and, rayon, but, nylon, fibers, may, melt, and, stick, to, skin, nylon, was, first, used, commercially, in, a, nylon, bristled, toothbrush, in, 1938, followed, more, famously, in, women, s, stockings, or, nylons, which, were, shown, at, the, 1939, new, york, world, s, fair, and, first, sold, commercially, in, 1940, its, use, increased, dramatically, during, world, war, ii, when, the, need, for, fabrics, increased, dramatically, bill, pittendreigh, dupont, and, other, individuals, and, corporations, worked, diligently, during, the, first, few, months, of, world, war, ii, to, find, a, way, to, replace, asian, silk, and, hemp, with, nylon, in, parachutes, it, was, also, used, to, make, tires, tents, ropes, ponchos, and, other, military, supplies, it, was, even, used, in, the, production, of, a, high, grade, paper, for, u, s, currency, at, the, outset, of, the, war, cotton, accounted, for, more, than, 80, of, all, fibers, used, and, manufactured, and, wool, fibers, accounted, for, nearly, all, of, the, rest, by, august, 1945, manufactured, fibers, had, taken, a, market, share, of, 25, at, the, expense, of, cotton, after, the, war, because, of, shortages, of, both, silk, and, nylon, nylon, parachute, material, was, sometimes, repurposed, to, make, dresses, nylon, 6, and, 66, fibers, are, used, in, carpet, manufacture, nylon, is, one, kind, of, fiber, used, in, tire, cord, herman, e, schroeder, pioneered, application, of, nylon, in, tires, nylon, resins, are, widely, used, in, the, automobile, industry, especially, in, the, engine, compartment, 514, molded, nylon, is, used, in, hair, combs, and, mechanical, parts, such, as, machine, screws, gears, gaskets, and, other, low, to, medium, stress, components, previously, cast, in, metal, engineering, grade, nylon, is, processed, by, extrusion, casting, and, injection, molding, type, 6, 6, nylon, 101, is, the, most, common, commercial, grade, of, nylon, and, nylon, 6, is, the, most, common, commercial, grade, of, molded, nylon, for, use, in, tools, such, as, spudgers, nylon, is, available, in, glass, filled, variants, which, increase, structural, and, impact, strength, and, rigidity, and, molybdenum, disulfide, filled, variants, which, increase, lubricity, nylon, can, be, used, as, the, matrix, material, in, composite, materials, with, reinforcing, fibers, like, glass, or, carbon, fiber, such, a, composite, has, a, higher, density, than, pure, nylon, such, thermoplastic, composites, 25, to, 30, glass, fiber, are, frequently, used, in, car, components, next, to, the, engine, such, as, intake, manifolds, where, the, good, heat, resistance, of, such, materials, makes, them, feasible, competitors, to, metals, nylon, was, used, to, make, the, stock, of, the, remington, nylon, 66, rifle, the, frame, of, the, modern, glock, pistol, is, made, of, a, nylon, composite, nylon, resins, are, used, as, a, component, of, food, packaging, films, where, an, oxygen, barrier, is, needed, some, of, the, terpolymers, based, upon, nylon, are, used, every, day, in, packaging, nylon, has, been, used, for, meat, wrappings, and, sausage, sheaths, the, high, temperature, resistance, of, nylon, makes, it, useful, for, oven, bags, nylon, filaments, are, primarily, used, in, brushes, especially, toothbrushes, and, string, trimmers, they, are, also, used, as, monofilaments, in, fishing, line, nylon, 610, and, 612, are, the, most, used, polymers, for, filaments, its, various, properties, also, make, it, very, useful, as, a, material, in, additive, manufacturing, specifically, as, a, filament, in, consumer, and, professional, grade, fused, deposition, modeling, 3d, printers, nylon, resins, can, be, extruded, into, rods, tubes, and, sheets, 209, nylon, powders, are, used, to, powder, coat, metals, nylon, 11, and, nylon, 12, are, the, most, widely, used, 53, in, the, mid, 1940s, classical, guitarist, andr, s, segovia, mentioned, the, shortage, of, good, guitar, strings, in, the, united, states, particularly, his, favorite, pirastro, catgut, strings, to, a, number, of, foreign, diplomats, at, a, party, including, general, lindeman, of, the, british, embassy, a, month, later, the, general, presented, segovia, with, some, nylon, strings, which, he, had, obtained, via, some, members, of, the, dupont, family, segovia, found, that, although, the, strings, produced, a, clear, sound, they, had, a, faint, metallic, timbre, which, he, hoped, could, be, eliminated, nylon, strings, were, first, tried, on, stage, by, olga, coelho, in, new, york, in, january, 1944, in, 1946, segovia, and, string, maker, albert, augustine, were, introduced, by, their, mutual, friend, vladimir, bobri, editor, of, guitar, review, on, the, basis, of, segovia, s, interest, and, augustine, s, past, experiments, they, decided, to, pursue, the, development, of, nylon, strings, dupont, skeptical, of, the, idea, agreed, to, supply, the, nylon, if, augustine, would, endeavor, to, develop, and, produce, the, actual, strings, after, three, years, of, development, augustine, demonstrated, a, nylon, first, string, whose, quality, impressed, guitarists, including, segovia, in, addition, to, dupont, wound, strings, however, were, more, problematic, eventually, however, after, experimenting, with, various, types, of, metal, and, smoothing, and, polishing, techniques, augustine, was, also, able, to, produce, high, quality, nylon, wound, strings
