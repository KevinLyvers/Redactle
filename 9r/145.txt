omega, centauri, cen, ngc, 5139, or, caldwell, 80, is, a, globular, cluster, in, the, constellation, of, centaurus, that, was, first, identified, as, a, non, stellar, object, by, edmond, halley, in, 1677, located, at, a, distance, of, 17, 090, light, years, 5, 240, parsecs, it, is, the, largest, known, globular, cluster, in, the, milky, way, at, a, diameter, of, roughly, 150, light, years, it, is, estimated, to, contain, approximately, 10, million, stars, with, a, total, mass, of, 4, million, solar, masses, making, it, the, most, massive, known, globular, cluster, in, the, milky, way, omega, centauri, is, very, different, from, most, other, galactic, globular, clusters, to, the, extent, that, it, is, thought, to, have, originated, as, the, core, remnant, of, a, disrupted, dwarf, galaxy, around, 150, ad, greco, roman, writer, and, astronomer, ptolemy, catalogued, this, object, in, his, almagest, as, a, star, on, the, centaur, s, back, quae, est, in, principio, scapulae, german, cartographer, johann, bayer, used, ptolemy, s, data, to, designate, this, object, omega, centauri, with, his, 1603, publication, of, uranometria, using, a, telescope, from, the, south, atlantic, island, of, saint, helena, english, astronomer, edmond, halley, rediscovered, this, object, in, 1677, listing, it, as, a, non, stellar, object, in, 1716, it, was, published, by, halley, among, his, list, of, six, luminous, spots, or, patches, in, the, philosophical, transactions, of, the, royal, society, swiss, astronomer, jean, philippe, de, cheseaux, included, omega, centauri, in, his, 1746, list, of, 21, nebulae, as, did, french, astronomer, lacaille, in, 1755, whence, the, catalogue, number, is, designated, l, i, 5, it, was, first, recognized, as, a, globular, cluster, by, scottish, astronomer, james, dunlop, in, 1826, who, described, it, as, a, beautiful, globe, of, stars, very, gradually, and, moderately, compressed, to, the, centre, at, a, distance, of, about, 17, 000, light, years, 5, 200, parsecs, from, earth, omega, centauri, is, one, of, the, few, globular, clusters, visible, to, the, naked, eye, and, appears, almost, as, large, as, the, full, moon, when, seen, from, a, dark, rural, area, it, is, the, brightest, largest, and, at, 4, million, solar, masses, the, most, massive, known, globular, cluster, associated, with, the, milky, way, of, all, the, globular, clusters, in, the, local, group, of, galaxies, only, mayall, ii, in, the, andromeda, galaxy, is, brighter, and, more, massive, orbiting, through, the, milky, way, omega, centauri, contains, several, million, population, ii, stars, and, is, about, 12, billion, years, old, the, stars, in, the, core, of, omega, centauri, are, so, crowded, that, they, are, estimated, to, average, only, 0, 1, light, year, away, from, each, other, the, internal, dynamics, have, been, analyzed, using, measurements, of, the, radial, velocities, of, 469, stars, the, members, of, this, cluster, are, orbiting, the, center, of, mass, with, a, peak, velocity, dispersion, of, 7, 9, km, s, 1, the, mass, distribution, inferred, from, the, kinematics, is, slightly, more, extended, than, though, not, strongly, inconsistent, with, the, luminosity, distribution, a, 2008, study, presented, evidence, for, an, intermediate, mass, black, hole, at, the, center, of, omega, centauri, based, on, observations, made, by, the, hubble, space, telescope, and, gemini, observatory, on, cerro, pach, n, in, chile, hubble, s, advanced, camera, for, surveys, showed, that, stars, are, bunching, up, near, the, center, of, omega, centauri, as, evidenced, by, the, gradual, increase, in, starlight, near, the, center, using, instruments, at, the, gemini, observatory, to, measure, the, speed, of, stars, swirling, in, the, cluster, s, core, e, noyola, and, colleagues, found, that, stars, closer, to, the, core, are, moving, faster, than, stars, farther, away, this, measurement, was, interpreted, to, mean, that, unseen, matter, at, the, core, is, interacting, gravitationally, with, nearby, stars, by, comparing, these, results, with, standard, models, the, astronomers, concluded, that, the, most, likely, cause, was, the, gravitational, pull, of, a, dense, massive, object, such, as, a, black, hole, they, calculated, the, object, s, mass, at, 40, 000, solar, masses, more, recent, work, has, challenged, conclusions, that, there, is, a, black, hole, in, the, cluster, s, core, in, particular, disputing, the, proposed, location, of, the, cluster, center, calculations, using, a, revised, location, for, the, center, found, that, the, velocity, of, core, stars, does, not, vary, with, distance, as, would, be, expected, if, an, intermediate, mass, black, hole, were, present, the, same, studies, also, found, that, starlight, does, not, increase, toward, the, center, but, instead, remains, relatively, constant, the, authors, noted, that, their, results, do, not, entirely, rule, out, the, black, hole, proposed, by, noyola, and, colleagues, but, they, do, not, confirm, it, and, they, limit, its, maximum, mass, to, 12, 000, solar, masses, a, study, from, july, 10, 2024, has, examined, seven, fast, moving, stars, from, the, center, of, omega, centauri, and, found, out, that, their, speeds, were, consistent, with, an, intermediate, mass, black, hole, of, at, least, 8, 200, solar, masses, it, has, been, speculated, that, omega, centauri, is, the, core, of, a, dwarf, galaxy, that, was, disrupted, and, absorbed, by, the, milky, way, indeed, kapteyn, s, star, which, is, currently, only, 13, light, years, away, from, earth, is, thought, to, originate, from, omega, centauri, omega, centauri, s, chemistry, and, motion, in, the, milky, way, are, also, consistent, with, this, picture, like, mayall, ii, omega, centauri, has, a, range, of, metallicities, and, stellar, ages, that, suggests, that, it, did, not, all, form, at, once, as, globular, clusters, are, thought, to, form, and, may, in, fact, be, the, remainder, of, the, core, of, a, smaller, galaxy, long, since, incorporated, into, the, milky, way, the, novel, singularity, 2012, by, ian, douglas, presents, as, fact, that, omega, centauri, and, kapteyn, s, star, originate, from, a, disrupted, dwarf, galaxy, and, this, origin, is, central, to, the, novel, s, plot, a, number, of, scientific, aspects, of, omega, centauri, are, discussed, as, the, story, progresses, including, the, likely, radiation, environment, inside, the, cluster, and, what, the, sky, might, look, like, from, inside, the, cluster, the, character, atlan, has,
