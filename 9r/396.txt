antimony, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, sb, from, latin, stibium, and, atomic, number, 51, a, lustrous, grey, metal, or, metalloid, it, is, found, in, nature, mainly, as, the, sulfide, mineral, stibnite, sb, 2, s, 3, antimony, compounds, have, been, known, since, ancient, times, and, were, powdered, for, use, as, medicine, and, cosmetics, often, known, by, the, arabic, name, kohl, the, earliest, known, description, of, this, metalloid, in, the, west, was, written, in, 1540, by, vannoccio, biringuccio, china, is, the, largest, producer, of, antimony, and, its, compounds, with, most, production, coming, from, the, xikuangshan, mine, in, hunan, the, industrial, methods, for, refining, antimony, from, stibnite, are, roasting, followed, by, reduction, with, carbon, or, direct, reduction, of, stibnite, with, iron, the, most, common, applications, for, metallic, antimony, are, in, alloys, with, lead, and, tin, which, have, improved, properties, for, solders, bullets, and, plain, bearings, it, improves, the, rigidity, of, lead, alloy, plates, in, lead, acid, batteries, antimony, trioxide, is, a, prominent, additive, for, halogen, containing, flame, retardants, antimony, is, used, as, a, dopant, in, semiconductor, devices, antimony, is, a, member, of, group, 15, of, the, periodic, table, one, of, the, elements, called, pnictogens, and, has, an, electronegativity, of, 2, 05, in, accordance, with, periodic, trends, it, is, more, electronegative, than, tin, or, bismuth, and, less, electronegative, than, tellurium, or, arsenic, antimony, is, stable, in, air, at, room, temperature, but, if, heated, it, reacts, with, oxygen, to, produce, antimony, trioxide, sb, 2, o, 3, antimony, is, a, silvery, lustrous, gray, metalloid, with, a, mohs, scale, hardness, of, 3, which, is, too, soft, to, mark, hard, objects, coins, of, antimony, were, issued, in, china, s, guizhou, in, 1931, durability, was, poor, and, minting, was, soon, discontinued, because, of, its, softness, and, toxicity, antimony, is, resistant, to, attack, by, acids, the, only, stable, allotrope, of, antimony, under, standard, conditions, is, metallic, brittle, silver, white, and, shiny, it, crystallises, in, a, trigonal, cell, isomorphic, with, bismuth, and, the, gray, allotrope, of, arsenic, and, is, formed, when, molten, antimony, is, cooled, slowly, amorphous, black, antimony, is, formed, upon, rapid, cooling, of, antimony, vapor, and, is, only, stable, as, a, thin, film, thickness, in, nanometres, thicker, samples, spontaneously, transform, into, the, metallic, form, it, oxidizes, in, air, and, may, ignite, spontaneously, at, 100, c, it, gradually, transforms, into, the, stable, form, the, supposed, yellow, allotrope, of, antimony, generated, only, by, oxidation, of, stibine, sbh, 3, at, 90, c, is, also, impure, and, not, a, true, allotrope, above, this, temperature, and, in, ambient, light, it, transforms, into, the, more, stable, black, allotrope, a, rare, explosive, form, of, antimony, can, be, formed, from, the, electrolysis, of, antimony, trichloride, but, it, always, contains, appreciable, chlorine, and, is, not, really, an, antimony, allotrope, when, scratched, with, a, sharp, implement, an, exothermic, reaction, occurs, and, white, fumes, are, given, off, as, metallic, antimony, forms, when, rubbed, with, a, pestle, in, a, mortar, a, strong, detonation, occurs, elemental, antimony, adopts, a, layered, structure, space, group, r, 3, m, no, 166, whose, layers, consist, of, fused, ruffled, six, membered, rings, the, nearest, and, next, nearest, neighbors, form, an, irregular, octahedral, complex, with, the, three, atoms, in, each, double, layer, slightly, closer, than, the, three, atoms, in, the, next, this, relatively, close, packing, leads, to, a, high, density, of, 6, 697, g, cm, 3, but, the, weak, bonding, between, the, layers, leads, to, the, low, hardness, and, brittleness, of, antimony, antimony, has, two, stable, isotopes, 121, sb, with, a, natural, abundance, of, 57, 36, and, 123, sb, with, a, natural, abundance, of, 42, 64, it, also, has, 35, radioisotopes, of, which, the, longest, lived, is, 125, sb, with, a, half, life, of, 2, 75, years, in, addition, 29, metastable, states, have, been, characterized, the, most, stable, of, these, is, 120m1, sb, with, a, half, life, of, 5, 76, days, isotopes, that, are, lighter, than, the, stable, 123, sb, tend, to, decay, by, decay, and, those, that, are, heavier, tend, to, decay, by, decay, with, some, exceptions, antimony, is, the, lightest, element, to, have, an, isotope, with, an, alpha, decay, branch, excluding, 8, be, and, other, light, nuclides, with, beta, delayed, alpha, emission, the, abundance, of, antimony, in, the, earth, s, crust, is, estimated, at, 0, 2, parts, per, million, comparable, to, thallium, at, 0, 5, ppm, and, silver, at, 0, 07, ppm, it, is, the, 63rd, most, abundant, element, in, the, crust, even, though, this, element, is, not, abundant, it, is, found, in, more, than, 100, mineral, species, antimony, is, sometimes, found, natively, e, g, on, antimony, peak, but, more, frequently, it, is, found, in, the, sulfide, stibnite, sb, 2, s, 3, which, is, the, predominant, ore, mineral, antimony, compounds, are, often, classified, according, to, their, oxidation, state, sb, iii, and, sb, v, the, 5, oxidation, state, is, more, common, antimony, trioxide, is, formed, when, antimony, is, burnt, in, air, in, the, gas, phase, the, molecule, of, the, compound, is, sb, 4, o, 6, but, it, polymerizes, upon, condensing, antimony, pentoxide, sb, 4, o, 10, can, be, formed, only, by, oxidation, with, concentrated, nitric, acid, antimony, also, forms, a, mixed, valence, oxide, antimony, tetroxide, sb, 2, o, 4, which, features, both, sb, iii, and, sb, v, unlike, oxides, of, phosphorus, and, arsenic, these, oxides, are, amphoteric, do, not, form, well, defined, oxoacids, and, react, with, acids, to, form, antimony, salts, antimonous, acid, sb, oh, 3, is, unknown, but, the, conjugate, base, sodium, antimonite, 4, forms, upon, fusing, sodium, oxide, and, sb, 4, o, 6, transition, metal, antimonites, are, also, known, 122, antimonic, acid, exists, only, as, the, hydrate, hsb, oh, 6, forming, salts, as, the, antimonate, anion, sb, oh, 6, when, a, solution, containing, this, anion, is, dehydrated, the, precipitate, contains, mixed, oxides, 143, the, most, important, antimony, ore, is, stibnite, sb, 2, s, 3, other, sulfide, minerals, include, pyrargyrite, ag, 3, sbs, 3, zinkenite, jamesonite, and, boulangerite, antimony, pentasulfide, is, non, stoichiometric, which, features, antimony, in, the, 3, oxidation, state, and, s, s, bonds, several, thioantimonides, are, known, such, as, 2, and, 2, antimony, forms, two, series, of, halides, sbx, 3, and, sbx, 5, the, trihalides, sbf, 3, sbcl, 3, sbbr, 3, and, sbi, 3, are, all, molecular, compounds, having, trigonal, pyramidal, molecular, geometry, the, trifluoride, sbf, 3, is, prepared, by, the, reaction, of, sb, 2, o, 3, with, hf, it, is, lewis, acidic, and, readily, accepts, fluoride, ions, to, form, the, complex, anions, sbf, 4, and, sbf, 2, 5, molten, sbf, 3, is, a, weak, electrical, conductor, the, trichloride, sbcl, 3, is, prepared, by, dissolving, sb, 2, s, 3, in, hydrochloric, acid, arsenic, sulfides, are, not, readily, attacked, by, the, hydrochloric, acid, so, this, method, offers, a, route, to, as, free, sb, the, pentahalides, sbf, 5, and, sbcl, 5, have, trigonal, bipyramidal, molecular, geometry, in, the, gas, phase, but, in, the, liquid, phase, sbf, 5, is, polymeric, whereas, sbcl, 5, is, monomeric, sbf, 5, is, a, powerful, lewis, acid, used, to, make, the, superacid, fluoroantimonic, acid, h, 2, sbf, 7, oxyhalides, are, more, common, for, antimony, than, for, arsenic, and, phosphorus, antimony, trioxide, dissolves, in, concentrated, acid, to, form, oxoantimonyl, compounds, such, as, sbocl, and, sbo, 2, so, 4, compounds, in, this, class, generally, are, described, as, derivatives, of, sb, 3, antimony, forms, antimonides, with, metals, such, as, indium, antimonide, insb, and, silver, antimonide, ag, 3, sb, the, alkali, metal, and, zinc, antimonides, such, as, na, 3, sb, and, zn, 3, sb, 2, are, more, reactive, treating, these, antimonides, with, acid, produces, the, highly, unstable, gas, stibine, sbh, 3, stibine, can, also, be, produced, by, treating, sb, 3, salts, with, hydride, reagents, such, as, sodium, borohydride, stibine, decomposes, spontaneously, at, room, temperature, because, stibine, has, a, positive, heat, of, formation, it, is, thermodynamically, unstable, and, thus, antimony, does, not, react, with, hydrogen, directly, organoantimony, compounds, are, typically, prepared, by, alkylation, of, antimony, halides, with, grignard, reagents, a, large, variety, of, compounds, are, known, with, both, sb, iii, and, sb, v, centers, including, mixed, chloro, organic, derivatives, anions, and, cations, examples, include, triphenylstibine, sb, c, 6, h, 5, 3, and, pentaphenylantimony, sb, c, 6, h, 5, 5, antimony, iii, sulfide, sb, 2, s, 3, was, recognized, in, predynastic, egypt, as, an, eye, cosmetic, kohl, as, early, as, about, 3100, bc, when, the, cosmetic, palette, was, invented, an, artifact, said, to, be, part, of, a, vase, made, of, antimony, dating, to, about, 3000, bc, was, found, at, telloh, chaldea, part, of, present, day, iraq, and, a, copper, object, plated, with, antimony, dating, between, 2500, bc, and, 2200, bc, has, been, found, in, egypt, austen, at, a, lecture, by, herbert, gladstone, in, 1892, commented, that, we, only, know, of, antimony, at, the, present, day, as, a, highly, brittle, and, crystalline, metal, which, could, hardly, be, fashioned, into, a, useful, vase, and, therefore, this, remarkable, find, artifact, mentioned, above, must, represent, the, lost, art, of, rendering, antimony, malleable, the, british, archaeologist, roger, moorey, was, unconvinced, the, artifact, was, indeed, a, vase, mentioning, that, selimkhanov, after, his, analysis, of, the, tello, object, published, in, 1975, attempted, to, relate, the, metal, to, transcaucasian, natural, antimony, i, e, native, metal, and, that, the, antimony, objects, from, transcaucasia, are, all, small, personal, ornaments, this, weakens, the, evidence, for, a, lost, art, of, rendering, antimony, malleable, the, roman, scholar, pliny, the, elder, described, several, ways, of, preparing, antimony, sulfide, for, medical, purposes, in, his, treatise, natural, history, around, 77, ad, pliny, the, elder, also, made, a, distinction, between, male, and, female, forms, of, antimony, the, male, form, is, probably, the, sulfide, while, the, female, form, which, is, superior, heavier, and, less, friable, has, been, suspected, to, be, native, metallic, antimony, the, greek, naturalist, pedanius, dioscorides, mentioned, that, antimony, sulfide, could, be, roasted, by, heating, by, a, current, of, air, it, is, thought, that, this, produced, metallic, antimony, antimony, was, frequently, described, in, alchemical, manuscripts, including, the, summa, perfectionis, of, pseudo, geber, written, around, the, 14th, century, a, description, of, a, procedure, for, isolating, antimony, is, later, given, in, the, 1540, book, de, la, pirotechnia, by, vannoccio, biringuccio, predating, the, more, famous, 1556, book, by, agricola, de, re, metallica, in, this, context, agricola, has, been, often, incorrectly, credited, with, the, discovery, of, metallic, antimony, the, book, currus, triumphalis, antimonii, the, triumphal, chariot, of, antimony, describing, the, preparation, of, metallic, antimony, was, published, in, germany, in, 1604, it, was, purported, to, be, written, by, a, benedictine, monk, writing, under, the, name, basilius, valentinus, in, the, 15th, century, if, it, were, authentic, which, it, is, not, it, would, predate, biringuccio, the, metal, antimony, was, known, to, german, chemist, andreas, libavius, in, 1615, who, obtained, it, by, adding, iron, to, a, molten, mixture, of, antimony, sulfide, salt, and, potassium, tartrate, this, procedure, produced, antimony, with, a, crystalline, or, starred, surface, with, the, advent, of, challenges, to, phlogiston, theory, it, was, recognized, that, antimony, is, an, element, forming, sulfides, oxides, and, other, compounds, as, do, other, metals, the, first, discovery, of, naturally, occurring, pure, antimony, in, the, earth, s, crust, was, described, by, the, swedish, scientist, and, local, mine, district, engineer, anton, von, swab, in, 1783, the, type, sample, was, collected, from, the, sala, silver, mine, in, the, bergslagen, mining, district, of, sala, v, stmanland, sweden, the, medieval, latin, form, from, which, the, modern, languages, and, late, byzantine, greek, take, their, names, for, antimony, is, antimonium, the, origin, of, that, is, uncertain, and, all, suggestions, have, some, difficulty, either, of, form, or, interpretation, the, popular, etymology, from, anti, monachos, or, french, antimoine, would, mean, monk, killer, which, is, explained, by, the, fact, that, many, early, alchemists, were, monks, and, some, antimony, compounds, were, poisonous, another, popular, etymology, is, the, hypothetical, greek, word, antimonos, against, aloneness, explained, as, not, found, as, metal, or, not, found, unalloyed, however, ancient, greek, would, more, naturally, express, the, pure, negative, as, not, edmund, oscar, von, lippmann, conjectured, a, hypothetical, greek, word, anthemonion, which, would, mean, floret, and, cites, several, examples, of, related, greek, words, but, not, that, one, which, describe, chemical, or, biological, efflorescence, the, early, uses, of, antimonium, include, the, translations, in, 1050, 1100, by, constantine, the, african, of, arabic, medical, treatises, several, authorities, believe, antimonium, is, a, scribal, corruption, of, some, arabic, form, meyerhof, derives, it, from, ithmid, other, possibilities, include, athimar, the, arabic, name, of, the, metalloid, and, a, hypothetical, as, stimmi, derived, from, or, parallel, to, the, greek, 28, the, standard, chemical, symbol, for, antimony, sb, is, credited, to, j, ns, jakob, berzelius, who, derived, the, abbreviation, from, stibium, the, ancient, words, for, antimony, mostly, have, as, their, chief, meaning, kohl, the, sulfide, of, antimony, the, egyptians, called, antimony, m, dmt, 230, 541, or, stm, the, arabic, word, for, the, substance, as, opposed, to, the, cosmetic, can, appear, as, ithmid, athmoud, othmod, or, uthmod, littr, suggests, the, first, form, which, is, the, earliest, derives, from, stimmida, an, accusative, for, stimmi, the, greek, word, stimmi, is, used, by, attic, tragic, poets, of, the, 5th, century, bc, and, is, possibly, a, loan, word, from, arabic, or, from, egyptian, stm, the, extraction, of, antimony, from, ores, depends, on, the, quality, and, composition, of, the, ore, most, antimony, is, mined, as, the, sulfide, lower, grade, ores, are, concentrated, by, froth, flotation, while, higher, grade, ores, are, heated, to, 500, 600, c, the, temperature, at, which, stibnite, melts, and, separates, from, the, gangue, minerals, antimony, can, be, isolated, from, the, crude, antimony, sulfide, by, reduction, with, scrap, iron, the, sulfide, is, converted, to, an, oxide, by, roasting, the, product, is, further, purified, by, vaporizing, the, volatile, antimony, iii, oxide, which, is, recovered, this, sublimate, is, often, used, directly, for, the, main, applications, impurities, being, arsenic, and, sulfide, antimony, is, isolated, from, the, oxide, by, a, carbothermal, reduction, the, lower, grade, ores, are, reduced, in, blast, furnaces, while, the, higher, grade, ores, are, reduced, in, reverberatory, furnaces, in, 2022, according, to, the, us, geological, survey, china, accounted, for, 54, 5, of, total, antimony, production, followed, in, second, place, by, russia, with, 18, 2, and, tajikistan, with, 15, 5, chinese, production, of, antimony, is, expected, to, decline, in, the, future, as, mines, and, smelters, are, closed, down, by, the, government, as, part, of, pollution, control, especially, due, to, an, environmental, protection, law, having, gone, into, effect, in, january, 2015, and, revised, emission, standards, of, pollutants, for, stanum, antimony, and, mercury, having, gone, into, effect, hurdles, for, economic, production, are, higher, reported, production, of, antimony, in, china, has, fallen, and, is, unlikely, to, increase, in, the, coming, years, according, to, the, roskill, report, no, significant, antimony, deposits, in, china, have, been, developed, for, about, ten, years, and, the, remaining, economic, reserves, are, being, rapidly, depleted, for, antimony, importing, regions, such, as, europe, and, the, u, s, antimony, is, considered, to, be, a, critical, mineral, for, industrial, manufacturing, that, is, at, risk, of, supply, chain, disruption, with, global, production, coming, mainly, from, china, 74, tajikistan, 8, and, russia, 4, these, sources, are, critical, to, supply, approximately, 48, of, antimony, is, consumed, in, flame, retardants, 33, in, lead, acid, batteries, and, 8, in, plastics, antimony, is, mainly, used, as, the, trioxide, for, flame, proofing, compounds, always, in, combination, with, halogenated, flame, retardants, except, in, halogen, containing, polymers, the, flame, retarding, effect, of, antimony, trioxide, is, produced, by, the, formation, of, halogenated, antimony, compounds, which, react, with, hydrogen, atoms, and, probably, also, with, oxygen, atoms, and, oh, radicals, thus, inhibiting, fire, markets, for, these, flame, retardants, include, children, s, clothing, toys, aircraft, and, automobile, seat, covers, they, are, also, added, to, polyester, resins, in, fiberglass, composites, for, such, items, as, light, aircraft, engine, covers, the, resin, will, burn, in, the, presence, of, an, externally, generated, flame, but, will, extinguish, when, the, external, flame, is, removed, antimony, forms, a, highly, useful, alloy, with, lead, increasing, its, hardness, and, mechanical, strength, when, casting, it, increases, fluidity, of, the, melt, and, reduces, shrinkage, during, cooling, for, most, applications, involving, lead, varying, amounts, of, antimony, are, used, as, alloying, metal, in, lead, acid, batteries, this, addition, improves, plate, strength, and, charging, characteristics, for, sailboats, lead, keels, are, used, to, provide, righting, moment, ranging, from, 600, lbs, to, over, 200, tons, for, the, largest, sailing, superyachts, to, improve, hardness, and, tensile, strength, of, the, lead, keel, antimony, is, mixed, with, lead, between, 2, and, 5, by, volume, antimony, is, used, in, antifriction, alloys, such, as, babbitt, metal, in, bullets, and, lead, shot, electrical, cable, sheathing, type, metal, for, example, for, linotype, printing, machines, solder, some, lead, free, solders, contain, 5, sb, in, pewter, and, in, hardening, alloys, with, low, tin, content, in, the, manufacturing, of, organ, pipes, three, other, applications, consume, nearly, all, the, rest, of, the, world, s, supply, one, application, is, as, a, stabilizer, and, catalyst, for, the, production, of, polyethylene, terephthalate, another, is, as, a, fining, agent, to, remove, microscopic, bubbles, in, glass, mostly, for, tv, screens, antimony, ions, interact, with, oxygen, suppressing, the, tendency, of, the, latter, to, form, bubbles, the, third, application, is, pigments, in, the, 1990s, antimony, was, increasingly, being, used, in, semiconductors, as, a, dopant, in, n, type, silicon, wafers, for, diodes, infrared, detectors, and, hall, effect, devices, in, the, 1950s, the, emitters, and, collectors, of, n, p, n, alloy, junction, transistors, were, doped, with, tiny, beads, of, a, lead, antimony, alloy, indium, antimonide, insb, is, used, as, a, material, for, mid, infrared, detectors, the, material, ge, 2, sb, 2, te, 5, is, used, as, for, phase, change, memory, a, type, of, computer, memory, biology, and, medicine, have, few, uses, for, antimony, treatments, containing, antimony, known, as, antimonials, are, used, as, emetics, antimony, compounds, are, used, as, antiprotozoan, drugs, potassium, antimonyl, tartrate, or, tartar, emetic, was, once, used, as, an, anti, schistosomal, drug, from, 1919, on, it, was, subsequently, replaced, by, praziquantel, antimony, and, its, compounds, are, used, in, several, veterinary, preparations, such, as, anthiomaline, and, lithium, antimony, thiomalate, as, a, skin, conditioner, in, ruminants, antimony, has, a, nourishing, or, conditioning, effect, on, keratinized, tissues, in, animals, antimony, based, drugs, such, as, meglumine, antimoniate, are, also, considered, the, drugs, of, choice, for, treatment, of, leishmaniasis, early, treatments, used, antimony, iii, species, trivalent, antimonials, but, in, 1922, upendranath, brahmachari, invented, an, much, safer, antimony, v, drug, and, since, then, so, called, pentavalent, antimonials, have, been, the, standard, first, line, treatment, however, leishmania, strains, in, bihar, and, neighboring, regions, have, developed, resistance, to, antimony, elemental, antimony, as, an, antimony, pill, was, once, used, as, a, medicine, it, could, be, reused, by, others, after, ingestion, and, elimination, antimony, iii, sulfide, is, used, in, the, heads, of, some, safety, matches, antimony, sulfides, help, to, stabilize, the, friction, coefficient, in, automotive, brake, pad, materials, antimony, is, used, in, bullets, bullet, tracers, paint, glass, art, and, as, an, opacifier, in, enamel, antimony, 124, is, used, together, with, beryllium, in, neutron, sources, the, gamma, rays, emitted, by, antimony, 124, initiate, the, photodisintegration, of, beryllium, the, emitted, neutrons, have, an, average, energy, of, 24, kev, natural, antimony, is, used, in, startup, neutron, sources, the, powder, derived, from, crushed, antimony, sulfide, kohl, has, been, used, for, millennia, as, an, eye, cosmetic, historically, it, was, applied, to, the, eyes, with, a, metal, rod, and, with, one, s, spittle, and, was, thought, by, the, ancients, to, aid, in, curing, eye, infections, the, practice, is, still, seen, in, yemen, and, in, other, muslim, countries, antimony, and, many, of, its, compounds, are, toxic, and, the, effects, of, antimony, poisoning, are, similar, to, arsenic, poisoning, the, toxicity, of, antimony, is, far, lower, than, that, of, arsenic, this, might, be, caused, by, the, significant, differences, of, uptake, metabolism, and, excretion, between, arsenic, and, antimony, the, uptake, of, antimony, iii, or, antimony, v, in, the, gastrointestinal, tract, is, at, most, 20, antimony, v, is, not, quantitatively, reduced, to, antimony, iii, in, the, cell, in, fact, antimony, iii, is, oxidised, to, antimony, v, instead, since, methylation, of, antimony, does, not, occur, the, excretion, of, antimony, v, in, urine, is, the, main, way, of, elimination, like, arsenic, the, most, serious, effect, of, acute, antimony, poisoning, is, cardiotoxicity, and, the, resulting, myocarditis, however, it, can, also, manifest, as, adams, stokes, syndrome, which, arsenic, does, not, reported, cases, of, intoxication, by, antimony, equivalent, to, 90, mg, antimony, potassium, tartrate, dissolved, from, enamel, has, been, reported, to, show, only, short, term, effects, an, intoxication, with, 6, g, of, antimony, potassium, tartrate, was, reported, to, result, in, death, after, three, days, inhalation, of, antimony, dust, is, harmful, and, in, certain, cases, may, be, fatal, in, small, doses, antimony, causes, headaches, dizziness, and, depression, larger, doses, such, as, prolonged, skin, contact, may, cause, dermatitis, or, damage, the, kidneys, and, the, liver, causing, violent, and, frequent, vomiting, leading, to, death, in, a, few, days, antimony, is, incompatible, with, strong, oxidizing, agents, strong, acids, halogen, acids, chlorine, or, fluorine, it, should, be, kept, away, from, heat, antimony, leaches, from, polyethylene, terephthalate, pet, bottles, into, liquids, while, levels, observed, for, bottled, water, are, below, drinking, water, guidelines, fruit, juice, concentrates, for, which, no, guidelines, are, established, produced, in, the, uk, were, found, to, contain, up, to, 44, 7, g, l, of, antimony, well, above, the, eu, limits, for, tap, water, of, 5, g, l, the, guidelines, are, the, tolerable, daily, intake, tdi, proposed, by, who, is, 6, g, antimony, per, kilogram, of, body, weight, the,
