hail, is, a, form, of, solid, precipitation, it, is, distinct, from, ice, pellets, american, english, sleet, though, the, two, are, often, confused, it, consists, of, balls, or, irregular, lumps, of, ice, each, of, which, is, called, a, hailstone, ice, pellets, generally, fall, in, cold, weather, while, hail, growth, is, greatly, inhibited, during, low, surface, temperatures, unlike, other, forms, of, water, ice, precipitation, such, as, graupel, which, is, made, of, rime, ice, ice, pellets, which, are, smaller, and, translucent, and, snow, which, consists, of, tiny, delicately, crystalline, flakes, or, needles, hailstones, usually, measure, between, 5, mm, 0, 2, in, and, 15, cm, 6, in, in, diameter, the, metar, reporting, code, for, hail, 5, mm, 0, 20, in, or, greater, is, gr, while, smaller, hailstones, and, graupel, are, coded, gs, hail, is, possible, within, most, thunderstorms, as, it, is, produced, by, cumulonimbus, as, well, as, within, 2, nmi, 3, 7, km, of, the, parent, storm, hail, formation, requires, environments, of, strong, upward, motion, of, air, within, the, parent, thunderstorm, similar, to, tornadoes, and, lowered, heights, of, the, freezing, level, in, the, mid, latitudes, hail, forms, near, the, interiors, of, continents, while, in, the, tropics, it, tends, to, be, confined, to, high, elevations, there, are, methods, available, to, detect, hail, producing, thunderstorms, using, weather, satellites, and, weather, radar, imagery, hailstones, generally, fall, at, higher, speeds, as, they, grow, in, size, though, complicating, factors, such, as, melting, friction, with, air, wind, and, interaction, with, rain, and, other, hailstones, can, slow, their, descent, through, earth, s, atmosphere, severe, weather, warnings, are, issued, for, hail, when, the, stones, reach, a, damaging, size, as, it, can, cause, serious, damage, to, human, made, structures, and, most, commonly, farmers, crops, any, thunderstorm, which, produces, hail, that, reaches, the, ground, is, known, as, a, hailstorm, an, ice, crystal, with, a, diameter, of, 5, mm, 0, 20, in, is, considered, a, hailstone, hailstones, can, grow, to, 15, cm, 6, in, and, weigh, more, than, 0, 5, kg, 1, 1, lb, unlike, ice, pellets, hailstones, are, often, layered, and, can, be, irregular, and, clumped, together, hail, is, composed, of, transparent, ice, or, alternating, layers, of, transparent, and, translucent, ice, at, least, 1, mm, 0, 039, in, thick, which, are, deposited, upon, the, hailstone, as, it, travels, through, the, cloud, suspended, aloft, by, air, with, strong, upward, motion, until, its, weight, overcomes, the, updraft, and, falls, to, the, ground, although, the, diameter, of, hail, is, varied, in, the, united, states, the, average, observation, of, damaging, hail, is, between, 2, 5, cm, 1, in, and, golf, ball, sized, 4, 4, cm, 1, 75, in, stones, larger, than, 2, cm, 0, 79, in, are, usually, considered, large, enough, to, cause, damage, the, meteorological, service, of, canada, issues, severe, thunderstorm, warnings, when, hail, that, size, or, above, is, expected, the, us, national, weather, service, has, a, 1, in, 2, 5, cm, diameter, threshold, effective, january, 2010, an, increase, over, the, previous, threshold, of, 0, 75, in, 1, 9, cm, hail, other, countries, have, different, thresholds, according, to, local, sensitivity, to, hail, for, instance, grape, growing, areas, could, be, adversely, impacted, by, smaller, hailstones, hailstones, can, be, very, large, or, very, small, depending, on, how, strong, the, updraft, is, weaker, hailstorms, produce, smaller, hailstones, than, stronger, hailstorms, such, as, supercells, as, the, more, powerful, updrafts, in, a, stronger, storm, can, keep, larger, hailstones, aloft, hail, forms, in, strong, thunderstorm, clouds, particularly, those, with, intense, updrafts, high, liquid, water, content, great, vertical, extent, large, water, droplets, and, where, a, good, portion, of, the, cloud, layer, is, below, freezing, 0, c, 32, f, these, types, of, strong, updrafts, can, also, indicate, the, presence, of, a, tornado, the, growth, rate, of, hailstones, is, impacted, by, factors, such, as, higher, elevation, lower, freezing, zones, and, wind, shear, like, other, precipitation, in, cumulonimbus, clouds, hail, begins, as, water, droplets, as, the, droplets, rise, and, the, temperature, goes, below, freezing, they, become, supercooled, water, and, will, freeze, on, contact, with, condensation, nuclei, a, cross, section, through, a, large, hailstone, shows, an, onion, like, structure, this, means, that, the, hailstone, is, made, of, thick, and, translucent, layers, alternating, with, layers, that, are, thin, white, and, opaque, former, theory, suggested, that, hailstones, were, subjected, to, multiple, descents, and, ascents, falling, into, a, zone, of, humidity, and, refreezing, as, they, were, uplifted, this, up, and, down, motion, was, thought, to, be, responsible, for, the, successive, layers, of, the, hailstone, new, research, based, on, theory, as, well, as, field, study, has, shown, this, is, not, necessarily, true, the, storm, s, updraft, with, upwardly, directed, wind, speeds, as, high, as, 110, mph, 180, km, h, blows, the, forming, hailstones, up, the, cloud, as, the, hailstone, ascends, it, passes, into, areas, of, the, cloud, where, the, concentration, of, humidity, and, supercooled, water, droplets, varies, the, hailstone, s, growth, rate, changes, depending, on, the, variation, in, humidity, and, supercooled, water, droplets, that, it, encounters, the, accretion, rate, of, these, water, droplets, is, another, factor, in, the, hailstone, s, growth, when, the, hailstone, moves, into, an, area, with, a, high, concentration, of, water, droplets, it, captures, the, latter, and, acquires, a, translucent, layer, should, the, hailstone, move, into, an, area, where, mostly, water, vapor, is, available, it, acquires, a, layer, of, opaque, white, ice, furthermore, the, hailstone, s, speed, depends, on, its, position, in, the, cloud, s, updraft, and, its, mass, this, determines, the, varying, thicknesses, of, the, layers, of, the, hailstone, the, accretion, rate, of, supercooled, water, droplets, onto, the, hailstone, depends, on, the, relative, velocities, between, these, water, droplets, and, the, hailstone, itself, this, means, that, generally, the, larger, hailstones, will, form, some, distance, from, the, stronger, updraft, where, they, can, pass, more, time, growing, as, the, hailstone, grows, it, releases, latent, heat, which, keeps, its, exterior, in, a, liquid, phase, because, it, undergoes, wet, growth, the, outer, layer, is, sticky, i, e, more, adhesive, so, a, single, hailstone, may, grow, by, collision, with, other, smaller, hailstones, forming, a, larger, entity, with, an, irregular, shape, hail, can, also, undergo, dry, growth, in, which, the, latent, heat, release, through, freezing, is, not, enough, to, keep, the, outer, layer, in, a, liquid, state, hail, forming, in, this, manner, appears, opaque, due, to, small, air, bubbles, that, become, trapped, in, the, stone, during, rapid, freezing, these, bubbles, coalesce, and, escape, during, the, wet, growth, mode, and, the, hailstone, is, more, clear, the, mode, of, growth, for, a, hailstone, can, change, throughout, its, development, and, this, can, result, in, distinct, layers, in, a, hailstone, s, cross, section, the, hailstone, will, keep, rising, in, the, thunderstorm, until, its, mass, can, no, longer, be, supported, by, the, updraft, this, may, take, at, least, 30, minutes, based, on, the, force, of, the, updrafts, in, the, hail, producing, thunderstorm, whose, top, is, usually, greater, than, 10, km, high, it, then, falls, toward, the, ground, while, continuing, to, grow, based, on, the, same, processes, until, it, leaves, the, cloud, it, will, later, begin, to, melt, as, it, passes, into, air, above, freezing, temperature, thus, a, unique, trajectory, in, the, thunderstorm, is, sufficient, to, explain, the, layer, like, structure, of, the, hailstone, the, only, case, in, which, multiple, trajectories, can, be, discussed, is, in, a, multicellular, thunderstorm, where, the, hailstone, may, be, ejected, from, the, top, of, the, mother, cell, and, captured, in, the, updraft, of, a, more, intense, daughter, cell, this, however, is, an, exceptional, case, hail, is, most, common, within, continental, interiors, of, the, mid, latitudes, as, hail, formation, is, considerably, more, likely, when, the, freezing, level, is, below, the, altitude, of, 11, 000, ft, 3, 400, m, movement, of, dry, air, into, strong, thunderstorms, over, continents, can, increase, the, frequency, of, hail, by, promoting, evaporational, cooling, which, lowers, the, freezing, level, of, thunderstorm, clouds, giving, hail, a, larger, volume, to, grow, in, accordingly, hail, is, less, common, in, the, tropics, despite, a, much, higher, frequency, of, thunderstorms, than, in, the, mid, latitudes, because, the, atmosphere, over, the, tropics, tends, to, be, warmer, over, a, much, greater, altitude, hail, in, the, tropics, occurs, mainly, at, higher, elevations, hail, growth, becomes, vanishingly, small, when, air, temperatures, fall, below, 30, c, 22, f, as, supercooled, water, droplets, become, rare, at, these, temperatures, around, thunderstorms, hail, is, most, likely, within, the, cloud, at, elevations, above, 20, 000, ft, 6, 100, m, between, 10, 000, ft, 3, 000, m, and, 20, 000, ft, 6, 100, m, 60, of, hail, is, still, within, the, thunderstorm, though, 40, now, lies, within, the, clear, air, under, the, anvil, below, 10, 000, ft, 3, 000, m, hail, is, equally, distributed, in, and, around, a, thunderstorm, to, a, distance, of, 2, nmi, 3, 7, km, hail, occurs, most, frequently, within, continental, interiors, at, mid, latitudes, and, is, less, common, in, the, tropics, despite, a, much, higher, frequency, of, thunderstorms, than, in, the, mid, latitudes, hail, is, also, much, more, common, along, mountain, ranges, because, mountains, force, horizontal, winds, upwards, known, as, orographic, lifting, thereby, intensifying, the, updrafts, within, thunderstorms, and, making, hail, more, likely, the, higher, elevations, also, result, in, there, being, less, time, available, for, hail, to, melt, before, reaching, the, ground, one, of, the, more, common, regions, for, large, hail, is, across, mountainous, northern, india, which, reported, one, of, the, highest, hail, related, death, tolls, on, record, in, 1888, china, also, experiences, significant, hailstorms, central, europe, and, southern, australia, also, experience, a, lot, of, hailstorms, regions, where, hailstorms, frequently, occur, are, southern, and, western, germany, northern, and, eastern, france, southern, and, eastern, benelux, and, northern, italy, in, southeastern, europe, croatia, and, serbia, experience, frequent, occurrences, of, hail, some, mediterranean, countries, register, the, maximum, frequency, of, hail, during, the, fall, season, in, north, america, hail, is, most, common, in, the, area, where, colorado, nebraska, and, wyoming, meet, known, as, hail, alley, hail, in, this, region, occurs, between, the, months, of, march, and, october, during, the, afternoon, and, evening, hours, with, the, bulk, of, the, occurrences, from, may, through, september, cheyenne, wyoming, is, north, america, s, most, hail, prone, city, with, an, average, of, nine, to, ten, hailstorms, per, season, to, the, north, of, this, area, and, also, just, downwind, of, the, rocky, mountains, is, the, hailstorm, alley, region, of, alberta, which, also, experiences, an, increased, incidence, of, significant, hail, events, hailstorms, are, also, common, in, several, regions, of, south, america, particularly, in, the, temperate, latitudes, the, central, region, of, argentina, extending, from, the, mendoza, region, eastward, towards, c, rdoba, experiences, some, of, the, most, frequent, hailstorms, in, the, world, with, 10, 30, storms, per, year, on, average, the, patagonia, region, of, southern, argentina, also, sees, frequent, hailstorms, though, this, may, be, partially, due, to, graupel, small, hail, being, counted, as, hail, in, this, colder, region, the, triple, border, region, between, the, brazilian, states, of, paran, santa, catarina, and, argentina, in, southern, brazil, is, another, area, known, for, damaging, hailstorms, hailstorms, are, also, common, in, parts, of, paraguay, uruguay, and, bolivia, that, border, the, high, frequency, hail, regions, of, northern, argentina, the, high, frequency, of, hailstorms, in, these, areas, of, south, america, is, attributed, to, the, region, s, orographic, forcing, of, convection, combined, with, moisture, transport, from, the, amazon, and, instability, created, by, temperature, contrasts, between, the, surface, and, upper, atmosphere, in, colombia, the, cities, of, bogot, and, medell, n, also, see, frequent, hailstorms, due, to, their, high, elevation, southern, chile, also, sees, persistent, hail, from, mid, april, through, october, weather, radar, is, a, very, useful, tool, to, detect, the, presence, of, hail, producing, thunderstorms, however, radar, data, has, to, be, complemented, by, a, knowledge, of, current, atmospheric, conditions, which, can, allow, one, to, determine, if, the, current, atmosphere, is, conducive, to, hail, development, modern, radar, scans, many, angles, around, the, site, reflectivity, values, at, multiple, angles, above, ground, level, in, a, storm, are, proportional, to, the, precipitation, rate, at, those, levels, summing, reflectivities, in, the, vertically, integrated, liquid, or, vil, gives, the, liquid, water, content, in, the, cloud, research, shows, that, hail, development, in, the, upper, levels, of, the, storm, is, related, to, the, evolution, of, vil, vil, divided, by, the, vertical, extent, of, the, storm, called, vil, density, has, a, relationship, with, hail, size, although, this, varies, with, atmospheric, conditions, and, therefore, is, not, highly, accurate, traditionally, hail, size, and, probability, can, be, estimated, from, radar, data, by, computer, using, algorithms, based, on, this, research, some, algorithms, include, the, height, of, the, freezing, level, to, estimate, the, melting, of, the, hailstone, and, what, would, be, left, on, the, ground, certain, patterns, of, reflectivity, are, important, clues, for, the, meteorologist, as, well, the, three, body, scatter, spike, is, an, example, this, is, the, result, of, energy, from, the, radar, hitting, hail, and, being, deflected, to, the, ground, where, they, deflect, back, to, the, hail, and, then, to, the, radar, the, energy, took, more, time, to, go, from, the, hail, to, the, ground, and, back, as, opposed, to, the, energy, that, went, directly, from, the, hail, to, the, radar, and, the, echo, is, further, away, from, the, radar, than, the, actual, location, of, the, hail, on, the, same, radial, path, forming, a, cone, of, weaker, reflectivities, more, recently, the, polarization, properties, of, weather, radar, returns, have, been, analyzed, to, differentiate, between, hail, and, heavy, rain, the, use, of, differential, reflectivity, z, d, r, displaystyle, z, dr, in, combination, with, horizontal, reflectivity, z, h, displaystyle, z, h, has, led, to, a, variety, of, hail, classification, algorithms, visible, satellite, imagery, is, beginning, to, be, used, to, detect, hail, but, false, alarm, rates, remain, high, using, this, method, the, size, of, hailstones, is, best, determined, by, measuring, their, diameter, with, a, ruler, in, the, absence, of, a, ruler, hailstone, size, is, often, visually, estimated, by, comparing, its, size, to, that, of, known, objects, such, as, coins, using, objects, such, as, hen, s, eggs, peas, and, marbles, for, comparing, hailstone, sizes, is, imprecise, due, to, their, varied, dimensions, the, uk, organisation, torro, also, scales, for, both, hailstones, and, hailstorms, when, observed, at, an, airport, metar, code, is, used, within, a, surface, weather, observation, which, relates, to, the, size, of, the, hailstone, within, metar, code, gr, is, used, to, indicate, larger, hail, of, a, diameter, of, at, least, 0, 25, in, 6, 4, mm, gr, is, derived, from, the, french, word, gr, le, smaller, sized, hail, as, well, as, snow, pellets, use, the, coding, of, gs, which, is, short, for, the, french, word, gr, sil, terminal, velocity, of, hail, or, the, speed, at, which, hail, is, falling, when, it, strikes, the, ground, varies, it, is, estimated, that, a, hailstone, of, 1, cm, 0, 39, in, in, diameter, falls, at, a, rate, of, 9, m, s, 20, mph, while, stones, the, size, of, 8, cm, 3, 1, in, in, diameter, fall, at, a, rate, of, 48, m, s, 110, mph, hailstone, velocity, is, dependent, on, the, size, of, the, stone, its, drag, coefficient, the, motion, of, wind, it, is, falling, through, collisions, with, raindrops, or, other, hailstones, and, melting, as, the, stones, fall, through, a, warmer, atmosphere, as, hailstones, are, not, perfect, spheres, it, is, difficult, to, accurately, calculate, their, drag, coefficient, and, thus, their, speed, in, the, united, states, the, national, weather, service, reports, hail, size, as, a, comparison, to, everyday, objects, hailstones, larger, than, 1, inch, in, diameter, are, denoted, as, severe, megacryometeors, large, rocks, of, ice, that, are, not, associated, with, thunderstorms, are, not, officially, recognized, by, the, world, meteorological, organization, as, hail, which, are, aggregations, of, ice, associated, with, thunderstorms, and, therefore, records, of, extreme, characteristics, of, megacryometeors, are, not, given, as, hail, records, hail, can, cause, serious, damage, notably, to, automobiles, aircraft, skylights, glass, roofed, structures, livestock, and, most, commonly, crops, hail, damage, to, roofs, often, goes, unnoticed, until, further, structural, damage, is, seen, such, as, leaks, or, cracks, it, is, hardest, to, recognize, hail, damage, on, shingled, roofs, and, flat, roofs, but, all, roofs, have, their, own, hail, damage, detection, problems, metal, roofs, are, fairly, resistant, to, hail, damage, but, may, accumulate, cosmetic, damage, in, the, form, of, dents, and, damaged, coatings, hail, is, one, of, the, most, significant, thunderstorm, hazards, to, aircraft, when, hailstones, exceed, 0, 5, in, 13, mm, in, diameter, planes, can, be, seriously, damaged, within, seconds, the, hailstones, accumulating, on, the, ground, can, also, be, hazardous, to, landing, aircraft, hail, is, a, common, nuisance, to, drivers, of, automobiles, severely, denting, the, vehicle, and, cracking, or, even, shattering, windshields, and, windows, unless, parked, in, a, garage, or, covered, with, a, shielding, material, wheat, corn, soybeans, and, tobacco, are, the, most, sensitive, crops, to, hail, damage, hail, is, one, of, canada, s, most, expensive, hazards, rarely, massive, hailstones, have, been, known, to, cause, concussions, or, fatal, head, trauma, hailstorms, have, been, the, cause, of, costly, and, deadly, events, throughout, history, one, of, the, earliest, known, incidents, occurred, around, the, 9th, century, in, roopkund, uttarakhand, india, where, 200, to, 600, nomads, seem, to, have, died, of, injuries, from, hail, the, size, of, cricket, balls, narrow, zones, where, hail, accumulates, on, the, ground, in, association, with, thunderstorm, activity, are, known, as, hail, streaks, or, hail, swaths, which, can, be, detectable, by, satellite, after, the, storms, pass, by, hailstorms, normally, last, from, a, few, minutes, up, to, 15, minutes, in, duration, accumulating, hail, storms, can, blanket, the, ground, with, over, 2, in, 5, 1, cm, of, hail, cause, thousands, to, lose, power, and, bring, down, many, trees, flash, flooding, and, mudslides, within, areas, of, steep, terrain, can, be, a, concern, with, accumulating, hail, depths, of, up, to, 18, in, 0, 46, m, have, been, reported, a, landscape, covered, in, accumulated, hail, generally, resembles, one, covered, in, accumulated, snow, and, any, significant, accumulation, of, hail, has, the, same, restrictive, effects, as, snow, accumulation, albeit, over, a, smaller, area, on, transport, and, infrastructure, accumulated, hail, can, also, cause, flooding, by, blocking, drains, and, hail, can, be, carried, in, the, floodwater, turning, into, a, snow, like, slush, which, is, deposited, at, lower, elevations, on, somewhat, rare, occasions, a, thunderstorm, can, become, stationary, or, nearly, so, while, prolifically, producing, hail, and, significant, depths, of, accumulation, do, occur, this, tends, to, happen, in, mountainous, areas, such, as, the, july, 29, 2010, case, of, a, foot, of, hail, accumulation, in, boulder, county, colorado, on, june, 5, 2015, hail, up, to, four, feet, deep, fell, on, one, city, block, in, denver, colorado, the, hailstones, described, as, between, the, size, of, bumble, bees, and, ping, pong, balls, were, accompanied, by, rain, and, high, winds, the, hail, fell, in, only, the, one, area, leaving, the, surrounding, area, untouched, it, fell, for, one, and, a, half, hours, between, 10, 00, pm, and, 11, 30, pm, a, meteorologist, for, the, national, weather, service, in, boulder, said, it, s, a, very, interesting, phenomenon, we, saw, the, storm, stall, it, produced, copious, amounts, of, hail, in, one, small, area, it, s, a, meteorological, thing, tractors, used, to, clear, the, area, filled, more, than, 30, dump, truck, loads, of, hail, research, focused, on, four, individual, days, that, accumulated, more, than, 5, 9, inches, 15, cm, of, hail, in, 30, minutes, on, the, colorado, front, range, has, shown, that, these, events, share, similar, patterns, in, observed, synoptic, weather, radar, and, lightning, characteristics, suggesting, the, possibility, of, predicting, these, events, prior, to, their, occurrence, a, fundamental, problem, in, continuing, research, in, this, area, is, that, unlike, hail, diameter, hail, depth, is, not, commonly, reported, the, lack, of, data, leaves, researchers, and, forecasters, in, the, dark, when, trying, to, verify, operational, methods, a, cooperative, effort, between, the, university, of, colorado, and, the, national, weather, service, is, in, progress, the, joint, project, s, goal, is, to, enlist, the, help, of, the, general, public, to, develop, a, database, of, hail, accumulation, depths, during, the, middle, ages, people, in, europe, used, to, ring, church, bells, and, fire, cannons, to, try, to, prevent, hail, and, the, subsequent, damage, to, crops, updated, versions, of, this, approach, are, available, as, modern, hail, cannons, cloud, seeding, after, world, war, ii, was, done, to, eliminate, the, hail, threat, particularly, across, the, soviet, union, where, it, was, claimed, a, 70, 98, reduction, in, crop, damage, from, hail, storms, was, achieved, by, deploying, silver, iodide, in, clouds, using, rockets, and, artillery, shells, but, these, effects, have, not, been, replicated, in, randomized, trials, conducted, in, the, west, hail, suppression, programs, have, been, undertaken, by, 15, countries, between, 1965, and, 2005
