the, tesla, symbol, t, is, the, unit, of, magnetic, flux, density, also, called, magnetic, b, field, strength, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, one, tesla, is, equal, to, one, weber, per, square, metre, the, unit, was, announced, during, the, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, in, 1960, and, is, named, in, honour, of, serbian, american, electrical, and, mechanical, engineer, nikola, tesla, upon, the, proposal, of, the, slovenian, electrical, engineer, france, av, in, a, particle, carrying, a, charge, of, one, coulomb, c, and, moving, perpendicularly, through, a, magnetic, field, of, one, tesla, at, a, speed, of, one, metre, per, second, m, s, experiences, a, force, with, magnitude, one, newton, n, according, to, the, lorentz, force, law, that, is, t, n, s, c, m, displaystyle, mathrm, t, dfrac, n, cdot, s, c, cdot, m, as, an, si, derived, unit, the, tesla, can, also, be, expressed, in, terms, of, other, units, for, example, a, magnetic, flux, of, 1, weber, wb, through, a, surface, of, one, square, meter, is, equal, to, a, magnetic, flux, density, of, 1, tesla, that, is, t, w, b, m, 2, displaystyle, mathrm, t, dfrac, wb, m, 2, expressed, only, in, si, base, units, 1, tesla, is, t, k, g, a, s, 2, displaystyle, mathrm, t, dfrac, kg, a, cdot, s, 2, where, a, is, ampere, kg, is, kilogram, and, s, is, second, additional, equivalences, result, from, the, derivation, of, coulombs, from, amperes, a, c, a, s, displaystyle, mathrm, c, a, cdot, s, t, n, a, m, displaystyle, mathrm, t, dfrac, n, a, cdot, m, the, relationship, between, newtons, and, joules, j, j, n, m, displaystyle, mathrm, j, n, cdot, m, t, j, a, m, 2, displaystyle, mathrm, t, dfrac, j, a, cdot, m, 2, and, the, derivation, of, the, weber, from, volts, v, w, b, v, s, displaystyle, mathrm, wb, v, cdot, s, t, v, s, m, 2, displaystyle, mathrm, t, dfrac, v, cdot, s, m, 2, the, tesla, is, named, after, nikola, tesla, as, with, every, si, unit, named, for, a, person, its, symbol, starts, with, an, upper, case, letter, t, but, when, written, in, full, it, follows, the, rules, for, capitalisation, of, a, common, noun, i, e, tesla, becomes, capitalised, at, the, beginning, of, a, sentence, and, in, titles, but, is, otherwise, in, lower, case, in, the, production, of, the, lorentz, force, the, difference, between, electric, fields, and, magnetic, fields, is, that, a, force, from, a, magnetic, field, on, a, charged, particle, is, generally, due, to, the, charged, particle, s, movement, while, the, force, imparted, by, an, electric, field, on, a, charged, particle, is, not, due, to, the, charged, particle, s, movement, this, may, be, appreciated, by, looking, at, the, units, for, each, the, unit, of, electric, field, in, the, mks, system, of, units, is, newtons, per, coulomb, n, c, while, the, magnetic, field, in, teslas, can, be, written, as, n, c, m, s, the, dividing, factor, between, the, two, types, of, field, is, metres, per, second, m, s, which, is, velocity, this, relationship, immediately, highlights, the, fact, that, whether, a, static, electromagnetic, field, is, seen, as, purely, magnetic, or, purely, electric, or, some, combination, of, these, is, dependent, upon, one, s, reference, frame, that, is, one, s, velocity, relative, to, the, field, in, ferromagnets, the, movement, creating, the, magnetic, field, is, the, electron, spin, and, to, a, lesser, extent, electron, orbital, angular, momentum, in, a, current, carrying, wire, electromagnets, the, movement, is, due, to, electrons, moving, through, the, wire, whether, the, wire, is, straight, or, circular, one, tesla, is, equivalent, to, for, the, relation, to, the, units, of, the, magnetising, field, ampere, per, metre, or, oersted, see, the, article, on, permeability, the, following, examples, are, listed, in, the, ascending, order, of, the, magnetic, field, strength
