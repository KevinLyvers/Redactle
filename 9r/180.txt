ursa, major, also, known, as, the, great, bear, is, a, constellation, in, the, northern, sky, whose, associated, mythology, likely, dates, back, into, prehistory, its, latin, name, means, greater, or, larger, bear, referring, to, and, contrasting, it, with, nearby, ursa, minor, the, lesser, bear, in, antiquity, it, was, one, of, the, original, 48, constellations, listed, by, ptolemy, in, the, 2nd, century, ad, drawing, on, earlier, works, by, greek, egyptian, babylonian, and, assyrian, astronomers, today, it, is, the, third, largest, of, the, 88, modern, constellations, ursa, major, is, primarily, known, from, the, asterism, of, its, main, seven, stars, which, has, been, called, the, big, dipper, the, wagon, charles, s, wain, or, the, plough, among, other, names, in, particular, the, big, dipper, s, stellar, configuration, mimics, the, shape, of, the, little, dipper, two, of, its, stars, named, dubhe, and, merak, ursae, majoris, and, ursae, majoris, can, be, used, as, the, navigational, pointer, towards, the, place, of, the, current, northern, pole, star, polaris, in, ursa, minor, ursa, major, along, with, asterisms, it, contains, or, overlaps, is, significant, to, numerous, world, cultures, often, as, a, symbol, of, the, north, its, depiction, on, the, flag, of, alaska, is, a, modern, example, of, such, symbolism, ursa, major, is, visible, throughout, the, year, from, most, of, the, northern, hemisphere, and, appears, circumpolar, above, the, mid, northern, latitudes, from, southern, temperate, latitudes, the, main, asterism, is, invisible, but, the, southern, parts, of, the, constellation, can, still, be, viewed, ursa, major, covers, 1279, 66, square, degrees, or, 3, 10, of, the, total, sky, making, it, the, third, largest, constellation, in, 1930, eug, ne, delporte, set, its, official, international, astronomical, union, iau, constellation, boundaries, defining, it, as, a, 28, sided, irregular, polygon, in, the, equatorial, coordinate, system, the, constellation, stretches, between, the, right, ascension, coordinates, of, 08, h, 08, 3, m, and, 14, h, 29, 0, m, and, the, declination, coordinates, of, 28, 30, and, 73, 14, ursa, major, borders, eight, other, constellations, draco, to, the, north, and, northeast, bo, tes, to, the, east, canes, venatici, to, the, east, and, southeast, coma, berenices, to, the, southeast, leo, and, leo, minor, to, the, south, lynx, to, the, southwest, and, camelopardalis, to, the, northwest, the, three, letter, constellation, abbreviation, uma, was, adopted, by, the, iau, in, 1922, the, outline, of, the, seven, bright, stars, of, ursa, major, form, the, asterism, known, as, the, big, dipper, in, the, united, states, and, canada, while, in, the, united, kingdom, it, is, called, the, plough, or, historically, charles, wain, six, of, the, seven, stars, are, of, second, magnitude, or, higher, and, it, forms, one, of, the, best, known, patterns, in, the, sky, as, many, of, its, common, names, allude, its, shape, is, said, to, resemble, a, ladle, an, agricultural, plough, or, wagon, in, the, context, of, ursa, major, they, are, commonly, drawn, to, represent, the, hindquarters, and, tail, of, the, great, bear, starting, with, the, ladle, portion, of, the, dipper, and, extending, clockwise, eastward, in, the, sky, through, the, handle, these, stars, are, the, following, except, for, dubhe, and, alkaid, the, stars, of, the, big, dipper, all, have, proper, motions, heading, toward, a, common, point, in, sagittarius, a, few, other, such, stars, have, been, identified, and, together, they, are, called, the, ursa, major, moving, group, the, stars, merak, ursae, majoris, and, dubhe, ursae, majoris, are, known, as, the, pointer, stars, because, they, are, helpful, for, finding, polaris, also, known, as, the, north, star, or, pole, star, by, visually, tracing, a, line, from, merak, through, dubhe, 1, unit, and, continuing, for, 5, units, one, s, eye, will, land, on, polaris, accurately, indicating, true, north, another, asterism, representing, three, pairs, of, footprints, of, a, leaping, gazelle, is, recognized, in, arab, culture, it, is, a, series, of, three, pairs, of, stars, found, along, the, southern, border, of, the, constellation, from, southeast, to, southwest, the, first, leap, comprising, and, ursae, majoris, alula, borealis, and, australis, respectively, the, second, leap, comprising, and, ursae, majoris, tania, borealis, and, australis, and, the, third, leap, comprising, and, ursae, majoris, talitha, borealis, and, australis, respectively, w, ursae, majoris, is, the, prototype, of, a, class, of, contact, binary, variable, stars, and, ranges, between, 7, 75, m, and, 8, 48, m, 47, ursae, majoris, is, a, sun, like, star,

the, east, of, ursae, majoris, and, to, the, southwest, of, the, big, dipper, has, been, recognized, as, the, state, star, of, delaware, and, is, informally, known, as, the, delaware, diamond, several, bright, galaxies, are, found, in, ursa, major, including, the, pair, messier, 81, one, of, the, brightest, galaxies, in, the, sky, and, messier, 82, above, the, bear, s, head, and, pinwheel, galaxy, m101, a, spiral, northeast, of, alkaid, the, spiral, galaxies, messier, 108, and, messier, 109, are, also, found, in, this, constellation, the, bright, planetary, nebula, owl, nebula, m97, can, be, found, along, the, bottom, of, the, bowl, of, the, big, dipper, m81, is, a, nearly, face, on, spiral, galaxy, 11, 8, million, light, years, from, earth, like, most, spiral, galaxies, it, has,

is, another, starburst, spiral, galaxy, located, 50, million, light, years, from, earth, its, bright, white, color, is, caused, by, its, higher, than, usual, rate, of, star, formation, which, began, 100, million, years, ago, after, a, merger, studies, of, this, and, other, starburst, galaxies, have, shown, that, their, starburst, phase, can, last, for, hundreds, of, millions, of, years, far,

rate, the, hubble, deep, field, is, located, to, the, northeast, of, ursae, majoris, hd, 80606, a, sun, like, star, in, a, binary, system, orbits, a, common, center, of, gravity, with, its, partner, hd, 80607, the, two, are, separated, by, 1, 200, au, on, average, research, conducted, in, 2003, indicates, that, its, sole, planet, hd, 80606, b, is, a, future, hot, jupiter, modeled, to, have, evolved, in, a, perpendicular, orbit, around, 5, au, from, its, sun, the, 4, jupiter, mass, planet, is, projected, to, eventually, move, into, a, circular, more, aligned, orbit, via, the, kozai, mechanism, however, it, is, currently, on, an, incredibly, eccentric, orbit, that, ranges, from, approximately, one, astronomical, unit, at, its, apoapsis, and, six, stellar, radii, at, periapsis, ursa, major, has, been, reconstructed, as, an, indo, european, constellation, it, was, one, of, the, 48, constellations, listed, by, the, 2nd, century, ad, astronomer, ptolemy, in, his, almagest, who, called, it, arktos, megale, it, is, mentioned, by, such, poets, as, homer, spenser, shakespeare, tennyson, and, also, by, federico, garcia, lorca, in, song, for, the, moon, ancient, finnish, poetry,

between, the, 7th, and, 4th, centuries, bc, although, this, is, often, disputed, the, constellation, of, ursa, major, has, been, seen, as, a, bear, usually, female, by, many, distinct, civilizations, this, may, stem, from, a, common, oral, tradition, of, cosmic, hunt, myths, stretching, back, more, than, 13, 000, years, using, statistical, and, phylogenetic, tools, julien, d, huy, reconstructs,

has, a, son, named, arcas, as, the, result, of, her, rape, by, zeus, and, transforms, callisto, into, a, bear, as, a, punishment, callisto, while, in, bear, form, later, encounters, her, son, arcas, arcas, almost, spears, the, bear, but, to, avert, the, tragedy, zeus, whisks, them, both, into, the, sky, callisto, as, ursa, major, and, arcas, as, the, constellation, bo, tes, ovid, called, ursa, major, the, parrhasian, bear, since, callisto, came, from, parrhasia, in, arcadia, where, the, story, is, set, the, greek, poet, aratus, called, the, constellation, helike, turning, or, twisting, because, it, turns, around, the, celestial, pole, the, odyssey, notes, that, it, is, the, sole, constellation, that, never, sinks, below, the, horizon, and, bathes, in, the, ocean, s, waves, so, it, is, used, as, a, celestial, reference, point, for, navigation, it, has, also, been, called, the, wain, or, plaustrum, a, latin, word, referring, to, a, horse, drawn, cart, in, hinduism, ursa, major,
