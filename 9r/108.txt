the, kuiper, belt, k, a, p, r, ky, p, r, is, a, circumstellar, disc, in, the, outer, solar, system, extending, from, the, orbit, of, neptune, at, 30, astronomical, units, au, to, approximately, 50, au, from, the, sun, it, is, similar, to, the, asteroid, belt, but, is, far, larger, 20, times, as, wide, and, 20, 200, times, as, massive, like, the, asteroid, belt, it, consists, mainly, of, small, bodies, or, remnants, from, when, the, solar, system, formed, while, many, asteroids, are, composed, primarily, of, rock, and, metal, most, kuiper, belt, objects, are, composed, largely, of, frozen, volatiles, termed, ices, such, as, methane, ammonia, and, water, the, kuiper, belt, is, home, to, most, of, the, objects, that, astronomers, generally, accept, as, dwarf, planets, orcus, pluto, haumea, quaoar, and, makemake, some, of, the, solar, system, s, moons, such, as, neptune, s, triton, and, saturn, s, phoebe, may, have, originated, in, the, region, the, kuiper, belt, is, named, in, honor, of, the, dutch, astronomer, gerard, kuiper, who, conjectured, the, existence, of, the, belt, in, 1951, there, were, researchers, before, and, after, him, who, also, speculated, on, its, existence, such, as, kenneth, edgeworth, in, the, 1930s, the, astronomer, julio, angel, fernandez, published, a, paper, in, 1980, suggesting, the, existence, of, a, comet, belt, beyond, neptune, which, could, serve, as, a, source, for, short, period, comets, in, 1992, minor, planet, 15760, albion, was, discovered, the, first, kuiper, belt, object, kbo, since, pluto, in, 1930, and, charon, in, 1978, since, its, discovery, the, number, of, known, kbos, has, increased, to, thousands, and, more, than, 100, 000, kbos, over, 100, km, 62, mi, in, diameter, are, thought, to, exist, the, kuiper, belt, was, initially, thought, to, be, the, main, repository, for, periodic, comets, those, with, orbits, lasting, less, than, 200, years, studies, since, the, mid, 1990s, have, shown, that, the, belt, is, dynamically, stable, and, that, comets, true, place, of, origin, is, the, scattered, disc, a, dynamically, active, zone, created, by, the, outward, motion, of, neptune, 4, 5, billion, years, ago, scattered, disc, objects, such, as, eris, have, extremely, eccentric, orbits, that, take, them, as, far, as, 100, au, from, the, sun, the, kuiper, belt, is, distinct, from, the, hypothesized, oort, cloud, which, is, believed, to, be, a, thousand, times, more, distant, and, mostly, spherical, the, objects, within, the, kuiper, belt, together, with, the, members, of, the, scattered, disc, and, any, potential, hills, cloud, or, oort, cloud, objects, are, collectively, referred, to, as, trans, neptunian, objects, tnos, pluto, is, the, largest, and, most, massive, member, of, the, kuiper, belt, and, the, largest, and, the, second, most, massive, known, tno, surpassed, only, by, eris, in, the, scattered, disc, originally, considered, a, planet, pluto, s, status, as, part, of, the, kuiper, belt, caused, it, to, be, reclassified, as, a, dwarf, planet, in, 2006, it, is, compositionally, similar, to, many, other, objects, of, the, kuiper, belt, and, its, orbital, period, is, characteristic, of, a, class, of, kbos, known, as, plutinos, that, share, the, same, 2, 3, resonance, with, neptune, the, kuiper, belt, and, neptune, may, be, treated, as, a, marker, of, the, extent, of, the, solar, system, alternatives, being, the, heliopause, and, the, distance, at, which, the, sun, s, gravitational, influence, is, matched, by, that, of, other, stars, estimated, to, be, between, 50, 000, au, and, 125, 000, au, after, the, discovery, of, pluto, in, 1930, many, speculated, that, it, might, not, be, alone, the, region, now, called, the, kuiper, belt, was, hypothesized, in, various, forms, for, decades, it, was, only, in, 1992, that, the, first, direct, evidence, for, its, existence, was, found, the, number, and, variety, of, prior, speculations, on, the, nature, of, the, kuiper, belt, have, led, to, continued, uncertainty, as, to, who, deserves, credit, for, first, proposing, it, 106, the, first, astronomer, to, suggest, the, existence, of, a, trans, neptunian, population, was, frederick, c, leonard, soon, after, pluto, s, discovery, by, clyde, tombaugh, in, 1930, leonard, pondered, whether, it, was, not, likely, that, in, pluto, there, has, come, to, light, the, first, of, a, series, of, ultra, neptunian, bodies, the, remaining, members, of, which, still, await, discovery, but, which, are, destined, eventually, to, be, detected, that, same, year, astronomer, armin, o, leuschner, suggested, that, pluto, may, be, one, of, many, long, period, planetary, objects, yet, to, be, discovered, in, 1943, in, the, journal, of, the, british, astronomical, association, kenneth, edgeworth, hypothesized, that, in, the, region, beyond, neptune, the, material, within, the, primordial, solar, nebula, was, too, widely, spaced, to, condense, into, planets, and, so, rather, condensed, into, a, myriad, smaller, bodies, from, this, he, concluded, that, the, outer, region, of, the, solar, system, beyond, the, orbits, of, the, planets, is, occupied, by, a, very, large, number, of, comparatively, small, bodies, xii, and, that, from, time, to, time, one, of, their, number, wanders, from, its, own, sphere, and, appears, as, an, occasional, visitor, to, the, inner, solar, system, 2, becoming, a, comet, in, 1951, in, a, paper, in, astrophysics, a, topical, symposium, gerard, kuiper, speculated, on, a, similar, disc, having, formed, early, in, the, solar, system, s, evolution, and, concluded, that, the, disc, consisted, of, remnants, of, original, clusterings, which, have, lost, many, members, that, became, stray, asteroids, much, as, has, occurred, with, open, galactic, clusters, dissolving, into, stars, in, another, paper, based, upon, a, lecture, kuiper, gave, in, 1950, also, called, on, the, origin, of, the, solar, system, kuiper, wrote, about, the, outermost, region, of, the, solar, nebula, from, 38, to, 50, astr, units, i, e, just, outside, proto, neptune, where, condensation, products, ices, of, h20, nh3, ch4, etc, must, have, formed, and, the, flakes, must, have, slowly, collected, and, formed, larger, aggregates, estimated, to, range, up, to, 1, km, or, more, in, size, he, continued, to, write, that, these, condensations, appear, to, account, for, the, comets, in, size, number, and, composition, according, to, kuiper, the, planet, pluto, which, sweeps, through, the, whole, zone, from, 30, to, 50, astr, units, is, held, responsible, for, having, started, the, scattering, of, the, comets, throughout, the, solar, system, it, is, said, that, kuiper, was, operating, on, the, assumption, common, in, his, time, that, pluto, was, the, size, of, earth, and, had, therefore, scattered, these, bodies, out, toward, the, oort, cloud, or, out, of, the, solar, system, there, would, not, be, a, kuiper, belt, today, if, this, were, correct, the, hypothesis, took, many, other, forms, in, the, following, decades, in, 1962, physicist, al, g, w, cameron, postulated, the, existence, of, a, tremendous, mass, of, small, material, on, the, outskirts, of, the, solar, system, 14, in, 1964, fred, whipple, who, popularised, the, famous, dirty, snowball, hypothesis, for, cometary, structure, thought, that, a, comet, belt, might, be, massive, enough, to, cause, the, purported, discrepancies, in, the, orbit, of, uranus, that, had, sparked, the, search, for, planet, x, or, at, the, very, least, massive, enough, to, affect, the, orbits, of, known, comets, observation, ruled, out, this, hypothesis, 14, in, 1977, charles, kowal, discovered, 2060, chiron, an, icy, planetoid, with, an, orbit, between, saturn, and, uranus, he, used, a, blink, comparator, the, same, device, that, had, allowed, clyde, tombaugh, to, discover, pluto, nearly, 50, years, before, in, 1992, another, object, 5145, pholus, was, discovered, in, a, similar, orbit, today, an, entire, population, of, comet, like, bodies, called, the, centaurs, is, known, to, exist, in, the, region, between, jupiter, and, neptune, the, centaurs, orbits, are, unstable, and, have, dynamical, lifetimes, of, a, few, million, years, from, the, time, of, chiron, s, discovery, in, 1977, astronomers, have, speculated, that, the, centaurs, therefore, must, be, frequently, replenished, by, some, outer, reservoir, 38, further, evidence, for, the, existence, of, the, kuiper, belt, later, emerged, from, the, study, of, comets, that, comets, have, finite, lifespans, has, been, known, for, some, time, as, they, approach, the, sun, its, heat, causes, their, volatile, surfaces, to, sublimate, into, space, gradually, dispersing, them, in, order, for, comets, to, continue, to, be, visible, over, the, age, of, the, solar, system, they, must, be, replenished, frequently, a, proposal, for, such, an, area, of, replenishment, is, the, oort, cloud, possibly, a, spherical, swarm, of, comets, extending, beyond, 50, 000, au, from, the, sun, first, hypothesised, by, dutch, astronomer, jan, oort, in, 1950, the, oort, cloud, is, thought, to, be, the, point, of, origin, of, long, period, comets, which, are, those, like, hale, bopp, with, orbits, lasting, thousands, of, years, 105, there, is, another, comet, population, known, as, short, period, or, periodic, comets, consisting, of, those, comets, that, like, halley, s, comet, have, orbital, periods, of, less, than, 200, years, by, the, 1970s, the, rate, at, which, short, period, comets, were, being, discovered, was, becoming, increasingly, inconsistent, with, their, having, emerged, solely, from, the, oort, cloud, 39, for, an, oort, cloud, object, to, become, a, short, period, comet, it, would, first, have, to, be, captured, by, the, giant, planets, in, a, paper, published, in, monthly, notices, of, the, royal, astronomical, society, in, 1980, uruguayan, astronomer, julio, fern, ndez, stated, that, for, every, short, period, comet, to, be, sent, into, the, inner, solar, system, from, the, oort, cloud, 600, would, have, to, be, ejected, into, interstellar, space, he, speculated, that, a, comet, belt, from, between, 35, and, 50, au, would, be, required, to, account, for, the, observed, number, of, comets, following, up, on, fern, ndez, s, work, in, 1988, the, canadian, team, of, martin, duncan, tom, quinn, and, scott, tremaine, ran, a, number, of, computer, simulations, to, determine, if, all, observed, comets, could, have, arrived, from, the, oort, cloud, they, found, that, the, oort, cloud, could, not, account, for, all, short, period, comets, particularly, as, short, period, comets, are, clustered, near, the, plane, of, the, solar, system, whereas, oort, cloud, comets, tend, to, arrive, from, any, point, in, the, sky, with, a, belt, as, fern, ndez, described, it, added, to, the, formulations, the, simulations, matched, observations, reportedly, because, the, words, kuiper, and, comet, belt, appeared, in, the, opening, sentence, of, fern, ndez, s, paper, tremaine, named, this, hypothetical, region, the, kuiper, belt, 191, in, 1987, astronomer, david, jewitt, then, at, mit, became, increasingly, puzzled, by, the, apparent, emptiness, of, the, outer, solar, system, he, encouraged, then, graduate, student, jane, luu, to, aid, him, in, his, endeavour, to, locate, another, object, beyond, pluto, s, orbit, because, as, he, told, her, if, we, don, t, nobody, will, 50, using, telescopes, at, the, kitt, peak, national, observatory, in, arizona, and, the, cerro, tololo, inter, american, observatory, in, chile, jewitt, and, luu, conducted, their, search, in, much, the, same, way, as, clyde, tombaugh, and, charles, kowal, had, with, a, blink, comparator, 50, initially, examination, of, each, pair, of, plates, took, about, eight, hours, 51, but, the, process, was, sped, up, with, the, arrival, of, electronic, charge, coupled, devices, or, ccds, which, though, their, field, of, view, was, narrower, were, not, only, more, efficient, at, collecting, light, they, retained, 90, of, the, light, that, hit, them, rather, than, the, 10, achieved, by, photographs, but, allowed, the, blinking, process, to, be, done, virtually, on, a, computer, screen, today, ccds, form, the, basis, for, most, astronomical, detectors, 52, 54, 56, in, 1988, jewitt, moved, to, the, institute, of, astronomy, at, the, university, of, hawaii, luu, later, joined, him, to, work, at, the, university, of, hawaii, s, 2, 24, m, telescope, at, mauna, kea, 57, 62, eventually, the, field, of, view, for, ccds, had, increased, to, 1024, by, 1024, pixels, which, allowed, searches, to, be, conducted, far, more, rapidly, 65, finally, after, five, years, of, searching, jewitt, and, luu, announced, on, 30, august, 1992, the, discovery, of, the, candidate, kuiper, belt, object, 1992, qb, 1, this, object, would, later, be, named, 15760, albion, six, months, later, they, discovered, a, second, object, in, the, region, 181708, 1993, fw, by, 2018, over, 2000, kuiper, belts, objects, had, been, discovered, over, one, thousand, bodies, were, found, in, a, belt, in, the, twenty, years, 1992, 2012, after, finding, 1992, qb, 1, named, in, 2018, 15760, albion, showing, a, vast, belt, of, bodies, more, than, just, pluto, and, albion, by, the, 2010s, the, full, extent, and, nature, of, kuiper, belt, bodies, is, largely, unknown, finally, in, the, late, 2010s, two, kbos, were, closely, flown, past, by, an, uncrewed, spacecraft, providing, much, closer, observations, of, the, plutonian, system, and, another, kbo, studies, conducted, since, the, trans, neptunian, region, was, first, charted, have, shown, that, the, region, now, called, the, kuiper, belt, is, not, the, point, of, origin, of, short, period, comets, but, that, they, instead, derive, from, a, linked, population, called, the, scattered, disc, the, scattered, disc, was, created, when, neptune, migrated, outward, into, the, proto, kuiper, belt, which, at, the, time, was, much, closer, to, the, sun, and, left, in, its, wake, a, population, of, dynamically, stable, objects, that, could, never, be, affected, by, its, orbit, the, kuiper, belt, proper, and, a, population, whose, perihelia, are, close, enough, that, neptune, can, still, disturb, them, as, it, travels, around, the, sun, the, scattered, disc, because, the, scattered, disc, is, dynamically, active, and, the, kuiper, belt, relatively, dynamically, stable, the, scattered, disc, is, now, seen, as, the, most, likely, point, of, origin, for, periodic, comets, astronomers, sometimes, use, the, alternative, name, edgeworth, kuiper, belt, to, credit, edgeworth, and, kbos, are, occasionally, referred, to, as, ekos, brian, g, marsden, claims, that, neither, deserves, true, credit, neither, edgeworth, nor, kuiper, wrote, about, anything, remotely, like, what, we, are, now, seeing, but, fred, whipple, did, 199, david, jewitt, comments, if, anything, fern, ndez, most, nearly, deserves, the, credit, for, predicting, the, kuiper, belt, kbos, are, sometimes, called, kuiperoids, a, name, suggested, by, clyde, tombaugh, the, term, trans, neptunian, object, tno, is, recommended, for, objects, in, the, belt, by, several, scientific, groups, because, the, term, is, less, controversial, than, all, others, it, is, not, an, exact, synonym, though, as, tnos, include, all, objects, orbiting, the, sun, past, the, orbit, of, neptune, not, just, those, in, the, kuiper, belt, at, its, fullest, extent, but, excluding, the, scattered, disc, including, its, outlying, regions, the, kuiper, belt, stretches, from, roughly, 30, 55, au, the, main, body, of, the, belt, is, generally, accepted, to, extend, from, the, 2, 3, mean, motion, resonance, see, below, at, 39, 5, au, to, the, 1, 2, resonance, at, roughly, 48, au, the, kuiper, belt, is, quite, thick, with, the, main, concentration, extending, as, much, as, ten, degrees, outside, the, ecliptic, plane, and, a, more, diffuse, distribution, of, objects, extending, several, times, farther, overall, it, more, resembles, a, torus, or, doughnut, than, a, belt, its, mean, position, is, inclined, to, the, ecliptic, by, 1, 86, degrees, the, presence, of, neptune, has, a, profound, effect, on, the, kuiper, belt, s, structure, due, to, orbital, resonances, over, a, timescale, comparable, to, the, age, of, the, solar, system, neptune, s, gravity, destabilises, the, orbits, of, any, objects, that, happen, to, lie, in, certain, regions, and, either, sends, them, into, the, inner, solar, system, or, out, into, the, scattered, disc, or, interstellar, space, this, causes, the, kuiper, belt, to, have, pronounced, gaps, in, its, current, layout, similar, to, the, kirkwood, gaps, in, the, asteroid, belt, in, the, region, between, 40, and, 42, au, for, instance, no, objects, can, retain, a, stable, orbit, over, such, times, and, any, observed, in, that, region, must, have, migrated, there, relatively, recently, between, the, 2, 3, and, 1, 2, resonances, with, neptune, at, approximately, 42, 48, au, the, gravitational, interactions, with, neptune, occur, over, an, extended, timescale, and, objects, can, exist, with, their, orbits, essentially, unaltered, this, region, is, known, as, the, classical, kuiper, belt, and, its, members, comprise, roughly, two, thirds, of, kbos, observed, to, date, because, the, first, modern, kbo, discovered, albion, but, long, called, 15760, 1992, qb, 1, is, considered, the, prototype, of, this, group, classical, kbos, are, often, referred, to, as, cubewanos, q, b, 1, os, the, guidelines, established, by, the, iau, demand, that, classical, kbos, be, given, names, of, mythological, beings, associated, with, creation, the, classical, kuiper, belt, appears, to, be, a, composite, of, two, separate, populations, the, first, known, as, the, dynamically, cold, population, has, orbits, much, like, the, planets, nearly, circular, with, an, orbital, eccentricity, of, less, than, 0, 1, and, with, relatively, low, inclinations, up, to, about, 10, they, lie, close, to, the, plane, of, the, solar, system, rather, than, at, an, angle, the, cold, population, also, contains, a, concentration, of, objects, referred, to, as, the, kernel, with, semi, major, axes, at, 44, 44, 5, au, the, second, the, dynamically, hot, population, has, orbits, much, more, inclined, to, the, ecliptic, by, up, to, 30, the, two, populations, have, been, named, this, way, not, because, of, any, major, difference, in, temperature, but, from, analogy, to, particles, in, a, gas, which, increase, their, relative, velocity, as, they, become, heated, up, not, only, are, the, two, populations, in, different, orbits, the, cold, population, also, differs, in, color, and, albedo, being, redder, and, brighter, has, a, larger, fraction, of, binary, objects, has, a, different, size, distribution, and, lacks, very, large, objects, the, mass, of, the, dynamically, cold, population, is, roughly, 30, times, less, than, the, mass, of, the, hot, the, difference, in, colors, may, be, a, reflection, of, different, compositions, which, suggests, they, formed, in, different, regions, the, hot, population, is, proposed, to, have, formed, near, neptune, s, original, orbit, and, to, have, been, scattered, out, during, the, migration, of, the, giant, planets, the, cold, population, on, the, other, hand, has, been, proposed, to, have, formed, more, or, less, in, its, current, position, because, the, loose, binaries, would, be, unlikely, to, survive, encounters, with, neptune, although, the, nice, model, appears, to, be, able, to, at, least, partially, explain, a, compositional, difference, it, has, also, been, suggested, the, color, difference, may, reflect, differences, in, surface, evolution, when, an, object, s, orbital, period, is, an, exact, ratio, of, neptune, s, a, situation, called, a, mean, motion, resonance, then, it, can, become, locked, in, a, synchronised, motion, with, neptune, and, avoid, being, perturbed, away, if, their, relative, alignments, are, appropriate, if, for, instance, an, object, orbits, the, sun, twice, for, every, three, neptune, orbits, and, if, it, reaches, perihelion, with, neptune, a, quarter, of, an, orbit, away, from, it, then, whenever, it, returns, to, perihelion, neptune, will, always, be, in, about, the, same, relative, position, as, it, began, because, it, will, have, completed, 1, 1, 2, orbits, in, the, same, time, this, is, known, as, the, 2, 3, or, 3, 2, resonance, and, it, corresponds, to, a, characteristic, semi, major, axis, of, about, 39, 4, au, this, 2, 3, resonance, is, populated, by, about, 200, known, objects, including, pluto, together, with, its, moons, in, recognition, of, this, the, members, of, this, family, are, known, as, plutinos, many, plutinos, including, pluto, have, orbits, that, cross, that, of, neptune, although, their, resonance, means, they, can, never, collide, plutinos, have, high, orbital, eccentricities, suggesting, that, they, are, not, native, to, their, current, positions, but, were, instead, thrown, haphazardly, into, their, orbits, by, the, migrating, neptune, iau, guidelines, dictate, that, all, plutinos, must, like, pluto, be, named, for, underworld, deities, the, 1, 2, resonance, whose, objects, complete, half, an, orbit, for, each, of, neptune, s, corresponds, to, semi, major, axes, of, 47, 7, au, and, is, sparsely, populated, its, residents, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, twotinos, other, resonances, also, exist, at, 3, 4, 3, 5, 4, 7, and, 2, 5, 104, neptune, has, a, number, of, trojan, objects, which, occupy, its, lagrangian, points, gravitationally, stable, regions, leading, and, trailing, it, in, its, orbit, neptune, trojans, are, in, a, 1, 1, mean, motion, resonance, with, neptune, and, often, have, very, stable, orbits, additionally, there, is, a, relative, absence, of, objects, with, semi, major, axes, below, 39, au, that, cannot, apparently, be, explained, by, the, present, resonances, the, currently, accepted, hypothesis, for, the, cause, of, this, is, that, as, neptune, migrated, outward, unstable, orbital, resonances, moved, gradually, through, this, region, and, thus, any, objects, within, it, were, swept, up, or, gravitationally, ejected, from, it, 107, the, 1, 2, resonance, at, 47, 8, au, appears, to, be, an, edge, beyond, which, few, objects, are, known, it, is, not, clear, whether, it, is, actually, the, outer, edge, of, the, classical, belt, or, just, the, beginning, of, a, broad, gap, objects, have, been, detected, at, the, 2, 5, resonance, at, roughly, 55, au, well, outside, the, classical, belt, predictions, of, a, large, number, of, bodies, in, classical, orbits, between, these, resonances, have, not, been, verified, through, observation, based, on, estimations, of, the, primordial, mass, required, to, form, uranus, and, neptune, as, well, as, bodies, as, large, as, pluto, see, mass, and, size, distribution, earlier, models, of, the, kuiper, belt, had, suggested, that, the, number, of, large, objects, would, increase, by, a, factor, of, two, beyond, 50, au, so, this, sudden, drastic, falloff, known, as, the, kuiper, cliff, was, unexpected, and, to, date, its, cause, is, unknown, bernstein, trilling, et, al, 2003, found, evidence, that, the, rapid, decline, in, objects, of, 100, km, or, more, in, radius, beyond, 50, au, is, real, and, not, due, to, observational, bias, possible, explanations, include, that, material, at, that, distance, was, too, scarce, or, too, scattered, to, accrete, into, large, objects, or, that, subsequent, processes, removed, or, destroyed, those, that, did, patryk, lykawka, of, kobe, university, claimed, that, the, gravitational, attraction, of, an, unseen, large, planetary, object, perhaps, the, size, of, earth, or, mars, might, be, responsible, an, analysis, of, the, tno, data, available, prior, to, september, 2023, shows, that, the, distribution, of, objects, at, the, outer, rim, of, the, classical, kuiper, belt, resembles, that, of, the, outer, main, asteroid, belt, with, a, gap, at, about, 72, au, far, from, any, mean, motion, resonances, with, neptune, the, outer, main, asteroid, belt, exhibits, a, gap, induced, by, the, 5, 6, mean, motion, resonance, with, jupiter, at, 5, 875, au, the, precise, origins, of, the, kuiper, belt, and, its, complex, structure, are, still, unclear, and, astronomers, are, awaiting, the, completion, of, several, wide, field, survey, telescopes, such, as, pan, starrs, and, the, future, lsst, which, should, reveal, many, currently, unknown, kbos, these, surveys, will, provide, data, that, will, help, determine, answers, to, these, questions, pan, starrs, 1, finished, its, primary, science, mission, in, 2014, and, the, full, data, from, the, pan, starrs, 1, surveys, were, published, in, 2019, helping, reveal, many, more, kbos, the, kuiper, belt, is, thought, to, consist, of, planetesimals, fragments, from, the, original, protoplanetary, disc, around, the, sun, that, failed, to, fully, coalesce, into, planets, and, instead, formed, into, smaller, bodies, the, largest, less, than, 3, 000, kilometres, 1, 900, mi, in, diameter, studies, of, the, crater, counts, on, pluto, and, charon, revealed, a, scarcity, of, small, craters, suggesting, that, such, objects, formed, directly, as, sizeable, objects, in, the, range, of, tens, of, kilometers, in, diameter, rather, than, being, accreted, from, much, smaller, roughly, kilometer, scale, bodies, hypothetical, mechanisms, for, the, formation, of, these, larger, bodies, include, the, gravitational, collapse, of, clouds, of, pebbles, concentrated, between, eddies, in, a, turbulent, protoplanetary, disk, or, in, streaming, instabilities, these, collapsing, clouds, may, fragment, forming, binaries, modern, computer, simulations, show, the, kuiper, belt, to, have, been, strongly, influenced, by, jupiter, and, neptune, and, also, suggest, that, neither, uranus, nor, neptune, could, have, formed, in, their, present, positions, because, too, little, primordial, matter, existed, at, that, range, to, produce, objects, of, such, high, mass, instead, these, planets, are, estimated, to, have, formed, closer, to, jupiter, scattering, of, planetesimals, early, in, the, solar, system, s, history, would, have, led, to, migration, of, the, orbits, of, the, giant, planets, saturn, uranus, and, neptune, drifted, outwards, whereas, jupiter, drifted, inwards, eventually, the, orbits, shifted, to, the, point, where, jupiter, and, saturn, reached, an, exact, 1, 2, resonance, jupiter, orbited, the, sun, twice, for, every, one, saturn, orbit, the, gravitational, repercussions, of, such, a, resonance, ultimately, destabilized, the, orbits, of, uranus, and, neptune, causing, them, to, be, scattered, outward, onto, high, eccentricity, orbits, that, crossed, the, primordial, planetesimal, disc, while, neptune, s, orbit, was, highly, eccentric, its, mean, motion, resonances, overlapped, and, the, orbits, of, the, planetesimals, evolved, chaotically, allowing, planetesimals, to, wander, outward, as, far, as, neptune, s, 1, 2, resonance, to, form, a, dynamically, cold, belt, of, low, inclination, objects, later, after, its, eccentricity, decreased, neptune, s, orbit, expanded, outward, toward, its, current, position, many, planetesimals, were, captured, into, and, remain, in, resonances, during, this, migration, others, evolved, onto, higher, inclination, and, lower, eccentricity, orbits, and, escaped, from, the, resonances, onto, stable, orbits, many, more, planetesimals, were, scattered, inward, with, small, fractions, being, captured, as, jupiter, trojans, as, irregular, satellites, orbiting, the, giant, planets, and, as, outer, belt, asteroids, the, remainder, were, scattered, outward, again, by, jupiter, and, in, most, cases, ejected, from, the, solar, system, reducing, the, primordial, kuiper, belt, population, by, 99, or, more, the, original, version, of, the, currently, most, popular, model, the, nice, model, reproduces, many, characteristics, of, the, kuiper, belt, such, as, the, cold, and, hot, populations, resonant, objects, and, a, scattered, disc, but, it, still, fails, to, account, for, some, of, the, characteristics, of, their, distributions, the, model, predicts, a, higher, average, eccentricity, in, classical, kbo, orbits, than, is, observed, 0, 10, 0, 13, versus, 0, 07, and, its, predicted, inclination, distribution, contains, too, few, high, inclination, objects, in, addition, the, frequency, of, binary, objects, in, the, cold, belt, many, of, which, are, far, apart, and, loosely, bound, also, poses, a, problem, for, the, model, these, are, predicted, to, have, been, separated, during, encounters, with, neptune, leading, some, to, propose, that, the, cold, disc, formed, at, its, current, location, representing, the, only, truly, local, population, of, small, bodies, in, the, solar, system, a, recent, modification, of, the, nice, model, has, the, solar, system, begin, with, five, giant, planets, including, an, additional, ice, giant, in, a, chain, of, mean, motion, resonances, about, 400, million, years, after, the, formation, of, the, solar, system, the, resonance, chain, is, broken, instead, of, being, scattered, into, the, disc, the, ice, giants, first, migrate, outward, several, au, this, divergent, migration, eventually, leads, to, a, resonance, crossing, destabilizing, the, orbits, of, the, planets, the, extra, ice, giant, encounters, saturn, and, is, scattered, inward, onto, a, jupiter, crossing, orbit, and, after, a, series, of, encounters, is, ejected, from, the, solar, system, the, remaining, planets, then, continue, their, migration, until, the, planetesimal, disc, is, nearly, depleted, with, small, fractions, remaining, in, various, locations, as, in, the, original, nice, model, objects, are, captured, into, resonances, with, neptune, during, its, outward, migration, some, remain, in, the, resonances, others, evolve, onto, higher, inclination, lower, eccentricity, orbits, and, are, released, onto, stable, orbits, forming, the, dynamically, hot, classical, belt, the, hot, belt, s, inclination, distribution, can, be, reproduced, if, neptune, migrated, from, 24, au, to, 30, au, on, a, 30, myr, timescale, when, neptune, migrates, to, 28, au, it, has, a, gravitational, encounter, with, the, extra, ice, giant, objects, captured, from, the, cold, belt, into, the, 1, 2, mean, motion, resonance, with, neptune, are, left, behind, as, a, local, concentration, at, 44, au, when, this, encounter, causes, neptune, s, semi, major, axis, to, jump, outward, the, objects, deposited, in, the, cold, belt, include, some, loosely, bound, blue, binaries, originating, from, closer, than, the, cold, belt, s, current, location, if, neptune, s, eccentricity, remains, small, during, this, encounter, the, chaotic, evolution, of, orbits, of, the, original, nice, model, is, avoided, and, a, primordial, cold, belt, is, preserved, in, the, later, phases, of, neptune, s, migration, a, slow, sweeping, of, mean, motion, resonances, removes, the, higher, eccentricity, objects, from, the, cold, belt, truncating, its, eccentricity, distribution, being, distant, from, the, sun, and, major, planets, kuiper, belt, objects, are, thought, to, be, relatively, unaffected, by, the, processes, that, have, shaped, and, altered, other, solar, system, objects, thus, determining, their, composition, would, provide, substantial, information, on, the, makeup, of, the, earliest, solar, system, due, to, their, small, size, and, extreme, distance, from, earth, the, chemical, makeup, of, kbos, is, very, difficult, to, determine, the, principal, method, by, which, astronomers, determine, the, composition, of, a, celestial, object, is, spectroscopy, when, an, object, s, light, is, broken, into, its, component, colors, an, image, akin, to, a, rainbow, is, formed, this, image, is, called, a, spectrum, different, substances, absorb, light, at, different, wavelengths, and, when, the, spectrum, for, a, specific, object, is, unravelled, dark, lines, called, absorption, lines, appear, where, the, substances, within, it, have, absorbed, that, particular, wavelength, of, light, every, element, or, compound, has, its, own, unique, spectroscopic, signature, and, by, reading, an, object, s, full, spectral, fingerprint, astronomers, can, determine, its, composition, analysis, indicates, that, kuiper, belt, objects, are, composed, of, a, mixture, of, rock, and, a, variety, of, ices, such, as, water, methane, and, ammonia, the, temperature, of, the, belt, is, only, about, 50, k, so, many, compounds, that, would, be, gaseous, closer, to, the, sun, remain, solid, the, densities, and, rock, ice, fractions, are, known, for, only, a, small, number, of, objects, for, which, the, diameters, and, the, masses, have, been, determined, the, diameter, can, be, determined, by, imaging, with, a, high, resolution, telescope, such, as, the, hubble, space, telescope, by, the, timing, of, an, occultation, when, an, object, passes, in, front, of, a, star, or, most, commonly, by, using, the, albedo, of, an, object, calculated, from, its, infrared, emissions, the, masses, are, determined, using, the, semi, major, axes, and, periods, of, satellites, which, are, therefore, known, only, for, a, few, binary, objects, the, densities, range, from, less, than, 0, 4, to, 2, 6, g, cm, 3, the, least, dense, objects, are, thought, to, be, largely, composed, of, ice, and, have, significant, porosity, the, densest, objects, are, likely, composed, of, rock, with, a, thin, crust, of, ice, there, is, a, trend, of, low, densities, for, small, objects, and, high, densities, for, the, largest, objects, one, possible, explanation, for, this, trend, is, that, ice, was, lost, from, the, surface, layers, when, differentiated, objects, collided, to, form, the, largest, objects, initially, detailed, analysis, of, kbos, was, impossible, and, so, astronomers, were, only, able, to, determine, the, most, basic, facts, about, their, makeup, primarily, their, color, these, first, data, showed, a, broad, range, of, colors, among, kbos, ranging, from, neutral, grey, to, deep, red, this, suggested, that, their, surfaces, were, composed, of, a, wide, range, of, compounds, from, dirty, ices, to, hydrocarbons, this, diversity, was, startling, as, astronomers, had, expected, kbos, to, be, uniformly, dark, having, lost, most, of, the, volatile, ices, from, their, surfaces, to, the, effects, of, cosmic, rays, 118, various, solutions, were, suggested, for, this, discrepancy, including, resurfacing, by, impacts, or, outgassing, jewitt, and, luu, s, spectral, analysis, of, the, known, kuiper, belt, objects, in, 2001, found, that, the, variation, in, color, was, too, extreme, to, be, easily, explained, by, random, impacts, the, radiation, from, the, sun, is, thought, to, have, chemically, altered, methane, on, the, surface, of, kbos, producing, products, such, as, tholins, makemake, has, been, shown, to, possess, a, number, of, hydrocarbons, derived, from, the, radiation, processing, of, methane, including, ethane, ethylene, and, acetylene, although, to, date, most, kbos, still, appear, spectrally, featureless, due, to, their, faintness, there, have, been, a, number, of, successes, in, determining, their, composition, in, 1996, robert, h, brown, et, al, acquired, spectroscopic, data, on, the, kbo, 1993, sc, which, revealed, that, its, surface, composition, is, markedly, similar, to, that, of, pluto, as, well, as, neptune, s, moon, triton, with, large, amounts, of, methane, ice, for, the, smaller, objects, only, colors, and, in, some, cases, the, albedos, have, been, determined, these, objects, largely, fall, into, two, classes, gray, with, low, albedos, or, very, red, with, higher, albedos, the, difference, in, colors, and, albedos, is, hypothesized, to, be, due, to, the, retention, or, the, loss, of, hydrogen, sulfide, h, 2, s, on, the, surface, of, these, objects, with, the, surfaces, of, those, that, formed, far, enough, from, the, sun, to, retain, h, 2, s, being, reddened, due, to, irradiation, the, largest, kbos, such, as, pluto, and, quaoar, have, surfaces, rich, in, volatile, compounds, such, as, methane, nitrogen, and, carbon, monoxide, the, presence, of, these, molecules, is, likely, due, to, their, moderate, vapor, pressure, in, the, 30, 50, k, temperature, range, of, the, kuiper, belt, this, allows, them, to, occasionally, boil, off, their, surfaces, and, then, fall, again, as, snow, whereas, compounds, with, higher, boiling, points, would, remain, solid, the, relative, abundances, of, these, three, compounds, in, the, largest, kbos, is, directly, related, to, their, surface, gravity, and, ambient, temperature, which, determines, which, they, can, retain, water, ice, has, been, detected, in, several, kbos, including, members, of, the, haumea, family, such, as, 1996, to, 66, mid, sized, objects, such, as, 38628, huya, and, 20000, varuna, and, also, on, some, small, objects, the, presence, of, crystalline, ice, on, large, and, mid, sized, objects, including, 50000, quaoar, where, ammonia, hydrate, has, also, been, detected, may, indicate, past, tectonic, activity, aided, by, melting, point, lowering, due, to, the, presence, of, ammonia, despite, its, vast, extent, the, collective, mass, of, the, kuiper, belt, is, relatively, low, the, total, mass, of, the, dynamically, hot, population, is, estimated, to, be, 1, the, mass, of, the, earth, the, dynamically, cold, population, is, estimated, to, be, much, smaller, with, only, 0, 03, the, mass, of, the, earth, while, the, dynamically, hot, population, is, thought, to, be, the, remnant, of, a, much, larger, population, that, formed, closer, to, the, sun, and, was, scattered, outward, during, the, migration, of, the, giant, planets, in, contrast, the, dynamically, cold, population, is, thought, to, have, formed, at, its, current, location, the, most, recent, estimate, 2018, puts, the, total, mass, of, the, kuiper, belt, at, 1, 97, 0, 30, 10, 2, earth, masses, based, on, the, influence, that, it, exerts, on, the, motion, of, planets, the, small, total, mass, of, the, dynamically, cold, population, presents, some, problems, for, models, of, the, solar, system, s, formation, because, a, sizable, mass, is, required, for, accretion, of, kbos, larger, than, 100, km, 62, mi, in, diameter, if, the, cold, classical, kuiper, belt, had, always, had, its, current, low, density, these, large, objects, simply, could, not, have, formed, by, the, collision, and, mergers, of, smaller, planetesimals, moreover, the, eccentricity, and, inclination, of, current, orbits, make, the, encounters, quite, violent, resulting, in, destruction, rather, than, accretion, the, removal, of, a, large, fraction, of, the, mass, of, the, dynamically, cold, population, is, thought, to, be, unlikely, neptune, s, current, influence, is, too, weak, to, explain, such, a, massive, vacuuming, and, the, extent, of, mass, loss, by, collisional, grinding, is, limited, by, the, presence, of, loosely, bound, binaries, in, the, cold, disk, which, are, likely, to, be, disrupted, in, collisions, instead, of, forming, from, the, collisions, of, smaller, planetesimals, the, larger, object, may, have, formed, directly, from, the, collapse, of, clouds, of, pebbles, the, size, distributions, of, the, kuiper, belt, objects, follow, a, number, of, power, laws, a, power, law, describes, the, relationship, between, n, d, the, number, of, objects, of, diameter, greater, than, d, and, d, and, is, referred, to, as, brightness, slope, the, number, of, objects, is, inversely, proportional, to, some, power, of, the, diameter, d, the, constant, may, be, non, zero, only, if, the, power, law, doesn, t, apply, at, high, values, of, d, early, estimates, that, were, based, on, measurements, of, the, apparent, magnitude, distribution, found, a, value, of, q, 4, 0, 5, which, implied, that, there, are, 8, 2, 3, times, more, objects, in, the, 100, 200, km, range, than, in, the, 200, 400, km, range, recent, research, has, revealed, that, the, size, distributions, of, the, hot, classical, and, cold, classical, objects, have, differing, slopes, the, slope, for, the, hot, objects, is, q, 5, 3, at, large, diameters, and, q, 2, 0, at, small, diameters, with, the, change, in, slope, at, 110, km, the, slope, for, the, cold, objects, is, q, 8, 2, at, large, diameters, and, q, 2, 9, at, small, diameters, with, a, change, in, slope, at, 140, km, the, size, distributions, of, the, scattering, objects, the, plutinos, and, the, neptune, trojans, have, slopes, similar, to, the, other, dynamically, hot, populations, but, may, instead, have, a, divot, a, sharp, decrease, in, the, number, of, objects, below, a, specific, size, this, divot, is, hypothesized, to, be, due, to, either, the, collisional, evolution, of, the, population, or, to, be, due, to, the, population, having, formed, with, no, objects, below, this, size, with, the, smaller, objects, being, fragments, of, the, original, objects, the, smallest, known, kuiper, belt, objects, with, radii, below, 1, km, have, only, been, detected, by, stellar, occultations, as, they, are, far, too, dim, magnitude, 35, to, be, seen, directly, by, telescopes, such, as, the, hubble, space, telescope, the, first, reports, of, these, occultations, were, from, schlichting, et, al, in, december, 2009, who, announced, the, discovery, of, a, small, sub, kilometre, radius, kuiper, belt, object, in, archival, hubble, photometry, from, march, 2007, with, an, estimated, radius, of, 520, 60, m, or, a, diameter, of, 1040, 120, m, the, object, was, detected, by, hubble, s, star, tracking, system, when, it, briefly, occulted, a, star, for, 0, 3, seconds, in, a, subsequent, study, published, in, december, 2012, schlichting, et, al, performed, a, more, thorough, analysis, of, archival, hubble, photometry, and, reported, another, occultation, event, by, a, sub, kilometre, sized, kuiper, belt, object, estimated, to, be, 530, 70, m, in, radius, or, 1060, 140, m, in, diameter, from, the, occultation, events, detected, in, 2009, and, 2012, schlichting, et, al, determined, the, kuiper, belt, object, size, distribution, slope, to, be, q, 3, 6, 0, 2, or, q, 3, 8, 0, 2, with, the, assumptions, of, a, single, power, law, and, a, uniform, ecliptic, latitude, distribution, their, result, implies, a, strong, deficit, of, sub, kilometer, sized, kuiper, belt, objects, compared, to, extrapolations, from, the, population, of, larger, kuiper, belt, objects, with, diameters, above, 90, km, observations, made, by, nasa, s, new, horizons, venetia, burney, student, dust, counter, showed, higher, than, model, predicted, dust, fluxes, as, far, as, 55, au, not, explained, by, any, existing, model, the, scattered, disc, is, a, sparsely, populated, region, overlapping, with, the, kuiper, belt, but, extending, to, beyond, 100, au, scattered, disc, objects, sdos, have, very, elliptical, orbits, often, also, very, inclined, to, the, ecliptic, most, models, of, solar, system, formation, show, both, kbos, and, sdos, first, forming, in, a, primordial, belt, with, later, gravitational, interactions, particularly, with, neptune, sending, the, objects, outward, some, into, stable, orbits, the, kbos, and, some, into, unstable, orbits, the, scattered, disc, due, to, its, unstable, nature, the, scattered, disc, is, suspected, to, be, the, point, of, origin, of, many, of, the, solar, system, s, short, period, comets, their, dynamic, orbits, occasionally, force, them, into, the, inner, solar, system, first, becoming, centaurs, and, then, short, period, comets, according, to, the, minor, planet, center, which, officially, catalogues, all, trans, neptunian, objects, a, kbo, is, any, object, that, orbits, exclusively, within, the, defined, kuiper, belt, region, regardless, of, origin, or, composition, objects, found, outside, the, belt, are, classed, as, scattered, objects, in, some, scientific, circles, the, term, kuiper, belt, object, has, become, synonymous, with, any, icy, minor, planet, native, to, the, outer, solar, system, assumed, to, have, been, part, of, that, initial, class, even, if, its, orbit, during, the, bulk, of, solar, system, history, has, been, beyond, the, kuiper, belt, e, g, in, the, scattered, disc, region, they, often, describe, scattered, disc, objects, as, scattered, kuiper, belt, objects, eris, which, is, known, to, be, more, massive, than, pluto, is, often, referred, to, as, a, kbo, but, is, technically, an, sdo, a, consensus, among, astronomers, as, to, the, precise, definition, of, the, kuiper, belt, has, yet, to, be, reached, and, this, issue, remains, unresolved, the, centaurs, which, are, not, normally, considered, part, of, the, kuiper, belt, are, also, thought, to, be, scattered, objects, the, only, difference, being, that, they, were, scattered, inward, rather, than, outward, the, minor, planet, center, groups, the, centaurs, and, the, sdos, together, as, scattered, objects, during, its, period, of, migration, neptune, is, thought, to, have, captured, a, large, kbo, triton, which, is, the, only, large, moon, in, the, solar, system, with, a, retrograde, orbit, that, is, it, orbits, opposite, to, neptune, s, rotation, this, suggests, that, unlike, the, large, moons, of, jupiter, saturn, and, uranus, which, are, thought, to, have, coalesced, from, rotating, discs, of, material, around, their, young, parent, planets, triton, was, a, fully, formed, body, that, was, captured, from, surrounding, space, gravitational, capture, of, an, object, is, not, easy, it, requires, some, mechanism, to, slow, down, the, object, enough, to, be, caught, by, the, larger, object, s, gravity, a, possible, explanation, is, that, triton, was, part, of, a, binary, when, it, encountered, neptune, many, kbos, are, members, of, binaries, see, below, ejection, of, the, other, member, of, the, binary, by, neptune, could, then, explain, triton, s, capture, triton, is, only, 14, larger, than, pluto, and, spectral, analysis, of, both, worlds, shows, that, their, surfaces, are, largely, composed, of, similar, materials, such, as, methane, and, carbon, monoxide, all, this, points, to, the, conclusion, that, triton, was, once, a, kbo, that, was, captured, by, neptune, during, its, outward, migration, since, 2000, a, number, of, kbos, with, diameters, of, between, 500, and, 1, 500, km, 932, mi, more, than, half, that, of, pluto, diameter, 2370, km, have, been, discovered, quaoar, a, classical, kbo, discovered, in, 2002, is, over, 1, 200, km, across, makemake, and, haumea, both, announced, on, 29, july, 2005, are, larger, still, other, objects, such, as, 28978, ixion, discovered, in, 2001, and, 20000, varuna, discovered, in, 2000, measure, roughly, 600, 700, km, 373, 435, mi, across, the, discovery, of, these, large, kbos, in, orbits, similar, to, pluto, s, led, many, to, conclude, that, aside, from, its, relative, size, pluto, was, not, particularly, different, from, other, members, of, the, kuiper, belt, not, only, are, these, objects, similar, to, pluto, in, size, but, many, also, have, natural, satellites, and, are, of, similar, composition, methane, and, carbon, monoxide, have, been, found, both, on, pluto, and, on, the, largest, kbos, thus, just, as, ceres, was, considered, a, planet, before, the, discovery, of, its, fellow, asteroids, some, began, to, suggest, that, pluto, might, also, be, reclassified, the, issue, was, brought, to, a, head, by, the, discovery, of, eris, an, object, in, the, scattered, disc, far, beyond, the, kuiper, belt, that, is, now, known, to, be, 27, more, massive, than, pluto, eris, was, originally, thought, to, be, larger, than, pluto, by, volume, but, the, new, horizons, mission, found, this, not, to, be, the, case, in, response, the, international, astronomical, union, iau, was, forced, to, define, what, a, planet, is, for, the, first, time, and, in, so, doing, included, in, their, definition, that, a, planet, must, have, cleared, the, neighbourhood, around, its, orbit, as, pluto, shares, its, orbit, with, many, other, sizable, objects, it, was, deemed, not, to, have, cleared, its, orbit, and, was, thus, reclassified, from, a, planet, to, a, dwarf, planet, making, it, a, member, of, the, kuiper, belt, it, is, not, clear, how, many, kbos, are, large, enough, to, be, dwarf, planets, consideration, of, the, surprisingly, low, densities, of, many, dwarf, planet, candidates, suggests, that, not, many, are, orcus, pluto, haumea, quaoar, and, makemake, are, accepted, by, most, astronomers, some, have, proposed, other, bodies, such, as, salacia, 2002, ms, 4, 2002, aw, 197, and, ixion, the, six, largest, tnos, eris, pluto, gonggong, makemake, haumea, and, quaoar, are, all, known, to, have, satellites, and, two, of, them, have, more, than, one, a, higher, percentage, of, the, larger, kbos, have, satellites, than, the, smaller, objects, in, the, kuiper, belt, suggesting, that, a, different, formation, mechanism, was, responsible, there, are, also, a, high, number, of, binaries, two, objects, close, enough, in, mass, to, be, orbiting, each, other, in, the, kuiper, belt, the, most, notable, example, is, the, pluto, charon, binary, but, it, is, estimated, that, around, 11, of, kbos, exist, in, binaries, on, 19, january, 2006, the, first, spacecraft, to, explore, the, kuiper, belt, new, horizons, was, launched, which, flew, by, pluto, on, 14, july, 2015, beyond, the, pluto, flyby, the, mission, s, goal, was, to, locate, and, investigate, other, farther, objects, in, the, kuiper, belt, on, 15, october, 2014, it, was, revealed, that, hubble, had, uncovered, three, potential, targets, provisionally, designated, pt1, potential, target, 1, pt2, and, pt3, by, the, new, horizons, team, the, objects, diameters, were, estimated, to, be, in, the, 30, 55, km, range, too, small, to, be, seen, by, ground, telescopes, at, distances, from, the, sun, of, 43, 44, au, which, would, put, the, encounters, in, the, 2018, 2019, period, the, initial, estimated, probabilities, that, these, objects, were, reachable, within, new, horizons, fuel, budget, were, 100, 7, and, 97, respectively, all, were, members, of, the, cold, low, inclination, low, eccentricity, classical, kuiper, belt, and, thus, very, different, from, pluto, pt1, given, the, temporary, designation, 1110113y, on, the, hst, web, site, the, most, favorably, situated, object, was, magnitude, 26, 8, 30, 45, km, in, diameter, and, was, encountered, in, january, 2019, once, sufficient, orbital, information, was, provided, the, minor, planet, center, gave, official, designations, to, the, three, target, kbos, 2014, mu, 69, pt1, 2014, os, 393, pt2, and, 2014, pn, 70, pt3, by, the, fall, of, 2014, a, possible, fourth, target, 2014, mt, 69, had, been, eliminated, by, follow, up, observations, pt2, was, out, of, the, running, before, the, pluto, flyby, on, 26, august, 2015, the, first, target, 2014, mu, 69, nicknamed, ultima, thule, and, later, named, 486958, arrokoth, was, chosen, course, adjustment, took, place, in, late, october, and, early, november, 2015, leading, to, a, flyby, in, january, 2019, on, 1, july, 2016, nasa, approved, additional, funding, for, new, horizons, to, visit, the, object, on, 2, december, 2015, new, horizons, detected, what, was, then, called, 1994, jr, 1, later, named, 15810, arawn, from, 270, million, kilometres, 170, 10, 6, mi, away, on, 1, january, 2019, new, horizons, successfully, flew, by, arrokoth, returning, data, showing, arrokoth, to, be, a, contact, binary, 32, km, long, by, 16, km, wide, the, ralph, instrument, aboard, new, horizons, confirmed, arrokoth, s, red, color, data, from, the, fly, by, will, continue, to, be, downloaded, over, the, next, 20, months, no, follow, up, missions, for, new, horizons, are, planned, though, at, least, two, concepts, for, missions, that, would, return, to, orbit, or, land, on, pluto, have, been, studied, beyond, pluto, there, exist, many, large, kbos, that, cannot, be, visited, with, new, horizons, such, as, the, dwarf, planets, makemake, and, haumea, new, missions, would, be, tasked, to, explore, and, study, these, objects, in, detail, thales, alenia, space, has, studied, the, logistics, of, an, orbiter, mission, to, haumea, a, high, priority, scientific, target, due, to, its, status, as, the, parent, body, of, a, collisional, family, that, includes, several, other, tnos, as, well, as, haumea, s, ring, and, two, moons, the, lead, author, joel, poncy, has, advocated, for, new, technology, that, would, allow, spacecraft, to, reach, and, orbit, kbos, in, 10, 20, years, or, less, new, horizons, principal, investigator, alan, stern, has, informally, suggested, missions, that, would, flyby, the, planets, uranus, or, neptune, before, visiting, new, kbo, targets, thus, furthering, the, exploration, of, the, kuiper, belt, while, also, visiting, these, ice, giant, planets, for, the, first, time, since, the, voyager, 2, flybys, in, the, 1980s, quaoar, has, been, considered, as, a, flyby, target, for, a, probe, tasked, with, exploring, the, interstellar, medium, as, it, currently, lies, near, the, heliospheric, nose, pontus, brandt, at, johns, hopkins, applied, physics, laboratory, and, his, colleagues, have, studied, a, probe, that, would, flyby, quaoar, in, the, 2030s, before, continuing, to, the, interstellar, medium, through, the, heliospheric, nose, among, their, interests, in, quaoar, include, its, likely, disappearing, methane, atmosphere, and, cryovolcanism, the, mission, studied, by, brandt, and, his, colleagues, would, launch, using, sls, and, achieve, 30, km, s, using, a, jupiter, flyby, alternatively, for, an, orbiter, mission, a, study, published, in, 2012, concluded, that, ixion, and, huya, are, among, the, most, feasible, targets, for, instance, the, authors, calculated, that, an, orbiter, mission, could, reach, ixion, after, 17, years, cruise, time, if, launched, in, 2039, by, 2006, astronomers, had, resolved, dust, discs, thought, to, be, kuiper, belt, like, structures, around, nine, stars, other, than, the, sun, they, appear, to, fall, into, two, categories, wide, belts, with, radii, of, over, 50, au, and, narrow, belts, tentatively, like, that, of, the, solar, system, with, radii, of, between, 20, and, 30, au, and, relatively, sharp, boundaries, beyond, this, 15, 20, of, solar, type, stars, have, an, observed, infrared, excess, that, is, suggestive, of, massive, kuiper, belt, like, structures, most, known, debris, discs, around, other, stars, are, fairly, young, but, the, two, images, on, the, right, taken, by, the, hubble, space, telescope, in, january, 2006, are, old, enough, roughly, 300, million, years, to, have, settled, into, stable, configurations, the, left, image, is, a, top, view, of, a, wide, belt, and, the, right, image, is, an, edge, view, of, a, narrow, belt, computer, simulations, of, dust, in, the, kuiper, belt, suggest, that, when, it, was, younger, it, may, have, resembled, the, narrow, rings, seen, around, younger, stars, solar, system, local, interstellar, cloud, local, bubble, gould, belt, orion,
