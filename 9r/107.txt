triton, is, the, largest, natural, satellite, of, the, planet, neptune, it, is, the, only, moon, of, neptune, massive, enough, to, be, rounded, under, its, own, gravity, and, hosts, a, thin, but, well, structured, atmosphere, triton, orbits, neptune, in, a, retrograde, orbit, revolving, in, the, opposite, direction, to, the, parent, planet, s, rotation, the, only, large, moon, in, the, solar, system, to, do, so, triton, is, thought, to, have, once, been, a, dwarf, planet, from, the, kuiper, belt, captured, into, neptune, s, orbit, by, the, latter, s, gravity, at, 2, 710, kilometers, 1, 680, mi, in, diameter, triton, is, the, seventh, largest, moon, in, the, solar, system, the, second, largest, planetary, moon, in, relation, to, its, primary, after, earth, s, moon, and, larger, than, all, of, the, known, dwarf, planets, the, mean, density, is, 2, 061, g, cm, 3, reflecting, a, composition, of, approximately, 30, 45, water, ice, by, mass, 866, with, the, rest, being, mostly, rock, and, metal, triton, is, differentiated, with, a, crust, of, primarily, ice, atop, a, probable, subsurface, ocean, of, liquid, water, and, a, solid, rocky, metallic, core, at, its, center, although, triton, s, orbit, is, nearly, circular, with, a, very, low, orbital, eccentricity, of, 0, 000016, triton, s, interior, may, still, experience, tidal, heating, through, obliquity, tides, triton, is, one, of, the, most, geologically, active, worlds, in, the, solar, system, with, an, estimated, average, surface, age, of, less, than, 100, million, years, old, its, surface, is, covered, by, frozen, nitrogen, and, is, geologically, young, with, very, few, impact, craters, young, intricate, cryovolcanic, and, tectonic, terrains, suggest, a, complex, geological, history, the, atmosphere, of, triton, is, composed, primarily, of, nitrogen, with, minor, components, of, methane, and, carbon, monoxide, triton, s, atmosphere, is, relatively, thin, and, strongly, variable, with, its, atmospheric, surface, pressure, varying, by, up, to, a, factor, of, three, within, the, past, 30, years, triton, s, atmosphere, supports, clouds, of, nitrogen, ice, crystals, and, a, layer, of, organic, atmospheric, haze, triton, was, the, first, neptunian, moon, to, be, discovered, on, october, 10, 1846, by, english, astronomer, william, lassell, the, 1989, flyby, of, triton, by, the, voyager, 2, spacecraft, remains, the, only, up, close, visit, to, the, moon, as, of, 2024, as, the, probe, was, only, able, to, study, about, 40, of, the, moon, s, surface, multiple, concept, missions, have, been, developed, to, revisit, triton, these, include, a, discovery, class, trident, and, new, frontiers, class, triton, ocean, worlds, surveyor, and, nautilus, triton, was, discovered, by, british, astronomer, william, lassell, on, october, 10, 1846, just, 17, days, after, the, discovery, of, neptune, when, john, herschel, received, news, of, neptune, s, discovery, he, wrote, to, lassell, suggesting, he, search, for, possible, moons, lassell, discovered, triton, eight, days, later, lassell, also, claimed, for, a, period, to, have, discovered, rings, although, neptune, was, later, confirmed, to, have, rings, they, are, so, faint, and, dark, that, it, is, not, plausible, he, saw, them, a, brewer, by, trade, lassell, spotted, triton, with, his, self, built, 61, cm, 24, in, aperture, metal, mirror, reflecting, telescope, also, known, as, the, two, foot, reflector, this, telescope, was, donated, to, the, royal, observatory, greenwich, in, the, 1880s, but, was, eventually, dismantled, triton, is, named, after, the, greek, sea, god, triton, the, son, of, poseidon, the, greek, god, corresponding, to, the, roman, neptune, the, name, was, first, proposed, by, camille, flammarion, in, his, 1880, book, astronomie, populaire, and, was, officially, adopted, many, decades, later, until, the, discovery, of, the, second, moon, nereid, in, 1949, triton, was, commonly, referred, to, as, the, satellite, of, neptune, lassell, did, not, name, his, discovery, he, later, successfully, suggested, the, name, hyperion, previously, chosen, by, john, herschel, for, the, eighth, moon, of, saturn, when, he, discovered, it, triton, is, unique, among, all, large, moons, in, the, solar, system, for, its, retrograde, orbit, around, its, planet, i, e, it, orbits, in, a, direction, opposite, to, the, planet, s, rotation, most, of, the, outer, irregular, moons, of, jupiter, and, saturn, also, have, retrograde, orbits, as, do, some, of, the, irregular, moons, of, uranus, and, neptune, however, these, moons, are, all, much, more, distant, from, their, primaries, and, are, small, in, comparison, the, largest, of, them, phoebe, has, only, 8, of, the, diameter, and, 0, 03, of, the, mass, of, triton, triton, s, orbit, is, associated, with, two, tilts, the, obliquity, of, neptune, s, rotation, to, neptune, s, orbit, 30, and, the, inclination, of, triton, s, orbit, to, neptune, s, rotation, 157, an, inclination, over, 90, indicates, retrograde, motion, triton, s, orbit, precesses, forward, relative, to, neptune, s, rotation, with, a, period, of, about, 678, earth, years, 4, 1, neptunian, years, making, its, neptune, orbit, relative, inclination, vary, between, 127, and, 173, that, inclination, is, currently, 130, triton, s, orbit, is, now, near, its, maximum, departure, from, coplanarity, with, neptune, s, triton, s, rotation, is, tidally, locked, to, be, synchronous, with, its, orbit, around, neptune, it, keeps, one, face, oriented, toward, the, planet, at, all, times, its, equator, is, almost, exactly, aligned, with, its, orbital, plane, at, present, triton, s, rotational, axis, is, about, 40, from, neptune, s, orbital, plane, hence, as, neptune, orbits, the, sun, triton, s, polar, regions, take, turns, facing, the, sun, resulting, in, seasonal, changes, as, one, pole, then, the, other, moves, into, the, sunlight, such, changes, were, observed, in, 2010, triton, s, revolution, around, neptune, has, become, a, nearly, perfect, circle, with, an, eccentricity, of, almost, zero, viscoelastic, damping, from, tides, alone, is, not, thought, to, be, capable, of, circularizing, triton, s, orbit, in, the, time, since, the, origin, of, the, system, and, gas, drag, from, a, prograde, debris, disc, is, likely, to, have, played, a, substantial, role, tidal, interactions, also, cause, triton, s, orbit, which, is, already, closer, to, neptune, than, the, moon, is, to, earth, to, gradually, decay, further, predictions, are, that, 3, 6, billion, years, from, now, triton, will, pass, within, neptune, s, roche, limit, this, will, result, in, either, a, collision, with, neptune, s, atmosphere, or, the, breakup, of, triton, forming, a, new, ring, system, similar, to, that, found, around, saturn, the, current, understanding, of, moons, in, retrograde, orbits, means, they, cannot, form, in, the, same, region, of, the, solar, nebula, as, the, planets, they, orbit, therefore, triton, must, have, been, captured, from, elsewhere, in, the, solar, system, astrophysicists, believe, it, might, have, originated, in, the, kuiper, belt, a, ring, of, small, icy, objects, extending, from, just, inside, the, orbit, of, neptune, to, about, 50, au, from, the, sun, thought, to, be, the, point, of, origin, for, the, majority, of, short, period, comets, observed, from, earth, the, belt, is, also, home, to, several, large, planet, like, bodies, including, pluto, which, is, now, recognized, as, the, largest, in, a, population, of, kuiper, belt, objects, the, plutinos, locked, in, resonant, orbits, with, neptune, triton, is, only, slightly, larger, than, pluto, and, is, nearly, identical, in, composition, which, has, led, to, the, hypothesis, that, the, two, share, a, common, origin, this, has, been, further, supported, in, a, 2024, study, of, the, chemical, composition, of, pluto, and, triton, which, suggests, they, originated, in, the, same, region, of, the, outer, solar, system, before, the, latter, was, pulled, into, neptune, s, orbit, kathleen, mandt, at, nasa, s, goddard, space, flight, center, in, maryland, and, her, colleagues, hypothesize, that, triton, and, pluto, formed, close, to, each, other, before, the, solar, system, settled, down, they, probably, formed, in, the, same, region, which, wouldn, t, be, where, the, kuiper, belt, is, now, it, would, have, been, either, closer, or, further, away, says, mandt, studying, prior, data, on, the, two, bodies, the, team, found, that, both, have, a, large, amount, of, nitrogen, and, trace, amounts, of, methane, and, carbon, monoxide, which, could, have, accumulated, in, the, outer, regions, of, the, young, nebula, for, some, reason, triton, was, then, ejected, from, this, region, and, ensnared, by, neptune, they, had, to, have, formed, beyond, the, water, ice, line, says, mandt, referring, to, the, distance, from, the, sun, where, water, would, freeze, into, ice, or, snow, which, is, why, triton, and, pluto, have, similar, amounts, of, certain, key, elements, one, possibility, is, that, the, giant, planets, moved, closer, to, the, sun, early, in, the, first, 100, million, years, or, so, of, the, solar, system, which, may, have, disrupted, the, orbits, of, some, bodies, like, triton, says, mandt, the, proposed, capture, of, triton, may, explain, several, features, of, the, neptunian, system, including, the, extremely, eccentric, orbit, of, neptune, s, moon, nereid, and, the, scarcity, of, moons, as, compared, to, the, other, giant, planets, triton, s, initially, eccentric, orbit, would, have, intersected, the, orbits, of, irregular, moons, and, disrupted, those, of, smaller, regular, moons, dispersing, them, through, gravitational, interactions, triton, s, eccentric, post, capture, orbit, would, have, also, resulted, in, tidal, heating, of, its, interior, which, could, have, kept, triton, fluid, for, a, billion, years, this, inference, is, supported, by, evidence, of, differentiation, in, triton, s, interior, this, source, of, internal, heat, disappeared, following, tidal, locking, and, circularization, of, the, orbit, two, types, of, mechanisms, have, been, proposed, for, triton, s, capture, to, be, gravitationally, captured, by, a, planet, a, passing, body, must, lose, sufficient, energy, to, be, slowed, down, to, a, speed, less, than, that, required, to, escape, an, early, model, of, how, triton, may, have, been, slowed, was, by, collision, with, another, object, either, one, that, happened, to, be, passing, by, neptune, which, is, unlikely, or, a, moon, or, proto, moon, in, orbit, around, neptune, which, is, more, likely, a, more, recent, hypothesis, suggests, that, before, its, capture, triton, was, part, of, a, binary, system, when, this, binary, encountered, neptune, it, interacted, in, such, a, way, that, the, binary, dissociated, with, one, portion, of, the, binary, expelled, and, the, other, triton, becoming, bound, to, neptune, this, event, is, more, likely, for, more, massive, companions, this, hypothesis, is, supported, by, several, lines, of, evidence, including, binaries, being, very, common, among, the, large, kuiper, belt, objects, the, event, was, brief, but, gentle, saving, triton, from, collisional, disruption, events, like, this, may, have, been, common, during, the, formation, of, neptune, or, later, when, it, migrated, outward, however, simulations, in, 2017, showed, that, after, triton, s, capture, and, before, its, orbital, eccentricity, decreased, it, probably, did, collide, with, at, least, one, other, moon, and, caused, collisions, between, other, moons, triton, is, the, seventh, largest, moon, and, sixteenth, largest, object, in, the, solar, system, and, is, modestly, larger, than, the, dwarf, planets, pluto, and, eris, it, is, also, the, largest, retrograde, moon, in, the, solar, system, it, accounts, for, more, than, 99, 5, of, all, the, mass, known, to, orbit, neptune, including, the, planet, s, rings, and, thirteen, other, known, moons, and, is, also, more, massive, than, all, known, moons, in, the, solar, system, smaller, than, itself, combined, also, with, a, diameter, 5, 5, that, of, neptune, it, is, the, largest, moon, of, a, gas, giant, relative, to, its, planet, in, terms, of, diameter, although, titan, is, bigger, relative, to, saturn, in, terms, of, mass, the, ratio, of, triton, s, mass, to, that, of, neptune, is, approximately, 1, 4788, it, has, a, radius, density, 2, 061, g, cm, 3, temperature, and, chemical, composition, similar, to, that, of, pluto, triton, s, surface, is, covered, with, a, transparent, layer, of, annealed, frozen, nitrogen, only, 40, of, triton, s, surface, has, been, observed, and, studied, but, it, may, be, entirely, covered, in, such, a, thin, sheet, of, nitrogen, ice, triton, s, surface, consists, of, 55, nitrogen, ice, with, other, ices, mixed, in, water, ice, comprises, 15, 35, and, frozen, carbon, dioxide, dry, ice, the, remaining, 10, 20, trace, ices, include, 0, 1, methane, and, 0, 05, carbon, monoxide, 868, there, could, also, be, ammonia, ice, on, the, surface, as, there, are, indications, of, ammonia, dihydrate, in, the, lithosphere, triton, s, mean, density, implies, that, it, probably, consists, of, about, 30, 45, water, ice, including, relatively, small, amounts, of, volatile, ices, with, the, remainder, being, rocky, material, triton, s, surface, area, is, 23, million, km, 2, which, is, 4, 5, of, earth, or, 15, 5, of, earth, s, land, area, triton, has, an, unusually, high, albedo, reflecting, 60, 95, of, the, sunlight, that, reaches, it, and, it, has, changed, only, slightly, since, the, first, observations, by, comparison, the, moon, reflects, only, 11, this, high, albedo, causes, triton, to, reflect, a, lot, of, whatever, little, sunlight, there, is, instead, of, absorbing, it, causing, it, to, have, the, coldest, recorded, temperature, in, the, solar, system, at, 38, k, 235, c, triton, s, reddish, color, is, thought, to, be, the, result, of, methane, ice, which, is, converted, to, tholins, under, exposure, to, ultraviolet, radiation, because, triton, s, surface, indicates, a, long, history, of, melting, models, of, its, interior, posit, that, triton, is, differentiated, like, earth, into, a, solid, core, a, mantle, and, a, crust, water, the, most, abundant, volatile, in, the, solar, system, comprises, triton, s, mantle, enveloping, a, core, of, rock, and, metal, there, is, enough, rock, in, triton, s, interior, for, radioactive, decay, to, maintain, a, liquid, subsurface, ocean, to, this, day, similar, to, what, is, thought, to, exist, beneath, the, surface, of, europa, and, several, other, icy, outer, solar, system, worlds, this, is, not, thought, to, be, adequate, to, power, convection, in, triton, s, icy, crust, however, the, strong, obliquity, tides, are, believed, to, generate, enough, additional, heat, to, accomplish, this, and, produce, the, observed, signs, of, recent, surface, geological, activity, the, black, material, ejected, is, suspected, to, contain, organic, compounds, and, if, liquid, water, is, present, on, triton, it, has, been, speculated, that, this, could, make, it, habitable, for, some, form, of, life, triton, has, a, tenuous, but, well, structured, and, global, nitrogen, atmosphere, with, trace, amounts, of, carbon, monoxide, and, small, amounts, of, methane, near, its, surface, like, pluto, s, atmosphere, the, atmosphere, of, triton, is, thought, to, result, from, the, evaporation, of, nitrogen, from, its, surface, its, surface, temperature, is, at, least, 35, 6, k, 237, 6, c, because, triton, s, nitrogen, ice, is, in, the, warmer, hexagonal, crystalline, state, and, the, phase, transition, between, hexagonal, and, cubic, nitrogen, ice, occurs, at, that, temperature, an, upper, limit, in, the, low, 40s, k, can, be, set, from, vapor, pressure, equilibrium, with, nitrogen, gas, in, triton, s, atmosphere, this, is, colder, than, pluto, s, average, equilibrium, temperature, of, 44, k, 229, 2, c, triton, s, surface, atmospheric, pressure, is, only, about, 1, 4, 1, 9, pa, 0, 014, 0, 019, mbar, turbulence, at, triton, s, surface, creates, a, troposphere, a, weather, region, rising, to, an, altitude, of, 8, km, streaks, on, triton, s, surface, left, by, geyser, plumes, suggest, that, the, troposphere, is, driven, by, seasonal, winds, capable, of, moving, material, over, a, micrometer, in, size, unlike, other, atmospheres, triton, s, lacks, a, stratosphere, and, instead, has, a, thermosphere, from, altitudes, of, 8, to, 950, km, and, an, exosphere, above, that, the, temperature, of, triton, s, upper, atmosphere, at, 95, 5, k, is, higher, than, that, at, its, surface, due, to, heat, absorbed, from, solar, radiation, and, neptune, s, magnetosphere, a, haze, permeates, most, of, triton, s, troposphere, thought, to, be, composed, largely, of, hydrocarbons, and, nitriles, created, by, the, action, of, sunlight, on, methane, triton, s, atmosphere, also, has, clouds, of, condensed, nitrogen, that, lie, between, 1, and, 3, km, from, its, surface, in, 1997, observations, from, earth, were, made, of, triton, s, limb, as, it, passed, in, front, of, stars, these, observations, indicated, the, presence, of, a, denser, atmosphere, than, was, deduced, from, voyager, 2, data, other, observations, have, shown, an, increase, in, temperature, by, 5, from, 1989, to, 1998, these, observations, indicated, triton, was, approaching, an, unusually, warm, southern, hemisphere, summer, season, that, happens, only, once, every, few, hundred, years, hypotheses, for, this, warming, include, a, change, of, frost, patterns, on, triton, s, surface, and, a, change, in, ice, albedo, which, would, allow, more, heat, to, be, absorbed, another, hypothesis, argues, that, temperature, changes, are, a, result, of, the, deposition, of, dark, red, material, from, geological, processes, because, triton, s, bond, albedo, is, among, the, highest, in, the, solar, system, it, is, sensitive, to, small, variations, in, spectral, albedo, based, on, the, increase, in, atmospheric, pressure, between, 1989, and, 1997, it, is, estimated, that, by, 2010, triton, s, atmospheric, pressure, may, have, increased, to, as, much, as, 4, pa, by, 2017, however, triton, s, atmospheric, surface, pressure, had, nearly, returned, to, voyager, 2, levels, the, cause, for, the, rapid, spike, in, atmospheric, pressure, between, 1989, and, 2017, remains, unexplained, all, detailed, knowledge, of, the, surface, of, triton, was, acquired, from, a, distance, of, 40, 000, km, by, the, voyager, 2, spacecraft, during, a, single, encounter, in, 1989, the, 40, of, triton, s, surface, imaged, by, voyager, 2, revealed, blocky, outcrops, ridges, troughs, furrows, hollows, plateaus, icy, plains, and, a, few, craters, triton, is, relatively, flat, its, observed, topography, never, varies, beyond, a, kilometer, the, impact, craters, observed, are, concentrated, almost, entirely, in, triton, s, leading, hemisphere, analysis, of, crater, density, and, distribution, has, suggested, that, in, geological, terms, triton, s, surface, is, extremely, young, with, regions, varying, from, an, estimated, 50, million, years, old, to, just, an, estimated, 6, million, years, old, fifty, five, percent, of, triton, s, surface, is, covered, with, frozen, nitrogen, with, water, ice, comprising, 15, 35, and, frozen, co, 2, forming, the, remaining, 10, 20, the, surface, also, has, deposits, of, tholins, a, dark, tarry, slurry, of, various, organic, chemical, compounds, one, of, the, largest, cryovolcanic, features, found, on, triton, is, leviathan, patera, a, caldera, like, feature, roughly, 100, km, in, diameter, seen, near, the, equator, surrounding, this, caldera, is, a, massive, cryovolcanic, plain, cipango, planum, which, is, at, least, 490, 000, km, 2, in, area, assuming, leviathan, patera, is, the, primary, vent, leviathan, patera, is, one, of, the, largest, volcanic, or, cryovolcanic, constructs, in, the, solar, system, this, feature, is, also, connected, to, two, enormous, cryolava, lakes, seen, northwest, of, the, caldera, because, the, cryolava, on, triton, is, believed, to, be, primarily, water, ice, with, some, ammonia, these, lakes, would, qualify, as, stable, bodies, of, surface, liquid, water, while, they, were, molten, this, is, the, first, place, such, bodies, have, been, found, apart, from, earth, and, triton, is, the, only, icy, body, known, to, feature, cryolava, lakes, although, similar, cryomagmatic, extrusions, can, be, seen, on, ariel, ganymede, charon, and, titan, the, voyager, 2, probe, in, 1989, observed, a, handful, of, geyser, like, eruptions, of, nitrogen, gas, or, water, and, entrained, dust, from, beneath, the, surface, of, triton, in, plumes, up, to, 8, km, high, triton, is, thus, one, of, the, few, bodies, in, the, solar, system, on, which, active, eruptions, of, some, sort, have, been, observed, the, best, observed, examples, are, the, hili, plume, and, mahilani, plume, named, after, a, zulu, water, sprite, and, a, tongan, sea, spirit, respectively, the, precise, mechanism, behind, triton, s, plumes, is, debated, one, hypothesis, is, that, triton, s, plumes, are, driven, by, solar, heating, underneath, a, transparent, or, translucent, layer, of, nitrogen, ice, creating, a, sort, of, solid, greenhouse, effect, as, solar, radiation, warms, the, darker, material, beneath, this, causes, a, rapid, increase, in, pressure, as, the, nitrogen, begins, to, sublimate, until, enough, pressure, accumulates, for, it, to, erupt, through, the, translucent, layer, this, model, is, largely, supported, by, the, observation, that, triton, was, near, peak, southern, summer, at, the, time, of, voyager, 2, s, flyby, ensuring, its, southern, polar, cap, was, receiving, prolonged, sunlight, if, this, were, the, case, co, 2, geysers, on, mars, are, thought, to, erupt, from, its, south, polar, cap, each, spring, in, the, same, way, however, the, significant, geological, activity, on, triton, has, led, to, alternative, proposals, that, the, plumes, may, be, cryovolcanic, in, nature, rather, than, driven, by, solar, radiation, a, cryovolcanic, origin, better, explains, the, estimated, output, of, triton, s, plumes, which, possibly, exceeds, 400, kilograms, per, second, 880, lb, s, this, is, similar, to, that, which, is, estimated, for, enceladus, s, cryovolcanic, plumes, at, 200, kg, s, 440, lb, s, however, if, triton, s, plumes, are, cryovolcanically, driven, it, remains, to, be, explained, why, they, predominantly, appear, over, its, southern, polar, cap, triton, s, high, surface, heat, flux, may, directly, melt, or, vaporize, nitrogen, ice, at, the, base, of, its, polar, caps, creating, hot, spots, which, break, through, the, ice, or, move, to, the, ice, caps, margins, before, erupting, explosively, though, only, observed, up, close, once, by, the, voyager, 2, spacecraft, it, is, estimated, that, a, plume, eruption, on, triton, may, last, up, to, a, year, triton, s, south, polar, region, is, covered, by, a, highly, reflective, cap, of, frozen, nitrogen, and, methane, sprinkled, by, impact, craters, and, openings, of, geysers, little, is, known, about, the, north, pole, because, it, was, on, the, night, side, during, the, voyager, 2, encounter, but, it, is, thought, that, triton, must, also, have, a, north, polar, ice, cap, the, high, plains, found, on, triton, s, eastern, hemisphere, such, as, cipango, planum, cover, over, and, blot, out, older, features, and, are, therefore, almost, certainly, the, result, of, icy, lava, washing, over, the, previous, landscape, the, plains, are, dotted, with, pits, such, as, leviathan, patera, which, are, probably, the, vents, from, which, this, lava, emerged, the, composition, of, the, lava, is, unknown, although, a, mixture, of, ammonia, and, water, is, suspected, four, roughly, circular, walled, plains, have, been, identified, on, triton, they, are, the, flattest, regions, so, far, discovered, with, a, variance, in, altitude, of, less, than, 200, m, they, are, thought, to, have, formed, from, the, eruption, of, icy, lava, the, plains, near, triton, s, eastern, limb, are, dotted, with, black, spots, the, maculae, some, maculae, are, simple, dark, spots, with, diffuse, boundaries, and, others, comprise, a, dark, central, patch, surrounded, by, a, white, halo, with, sharp, boundaries, the, maculae, typically, have, diameters, of, about, 100, km, and, widths, of, the, halos, of, between, 20, and, 30, km, there, are, extensive, ridges, and, valleys, in, complex, patterns, across, triton, s, surface, probably, the, result, of, freeze, thaw, cycles, many, also, appear, to, be, tectonic, and, may, result, from, an, extension, or, strike, slip, faulting, there, are, long, double, ridges, of, ice, with, central, troughs, bearing, a, strong, resemblance, to, europan, lineae, although, they, have, a, larger, scale, and, which, may, have, a, similar, origin, possibly, shear, heating, from, strike, slip, motion, along, faults, caused, by, diurnal, tidal, stresses, experienced, before, triton, s, orbit, was, fully, circularized, these, faults, with, parallel, ridges, expelled, from, the, interior, cross, complex, terrain, with, valleys, in, the, equatorial, region, the, ridges, and, furrows, or, sulci, such, as, yasu, sulci, ho, sulci, and, lo, sulci, are, thought, to, be, of, intermediate, age, in, triton, s, geological, history, and, in, many, cases, to, have, formed, concurrently, they, tend, to, be, clustered, in, groups, or, packets, triton, s, western, hemisphere, consists, of, a, strange, series, of, fissures, and, depressions, known, as, cantaloupe, terrain, because, it, resembles, the, skin, of, a, cantaloupe, melon, although, it, has, few, craters, it, is, thought, that, this, is, the, oldest, terrain, on, triton, it, probably, covers, much, of, triton, s, western, half, cantaloupe, terrain, which, is, mostly, dirty, water, ice, is, only, known, to, exist, on, triton, it, contains, depressions, 30, 40, km, in, diameter, the, depressions, cavi, are, probably, not, impact, craters, because, they, are, all, of, the, similar, size, and, have, smooth, curves, the, leading, hypothesis, for, their, formation, is, diapirism, the, rising, of, lumps, of, less, dense, material, through, a, stratum, of, denser, material, alternative, hypotheses, include, formation, by, collapses, or, by, flooding, caused, by, cryovolcanism, due, to, constant, erasure, and, modification, by, ongoing, geological, activity, impact, craters, on, triton, s, surface, are, relatively, rare, a, census, of, triton, s, craters, imaged, by, voyager, 2, found, only, 179, that, were, incontestably, of, impact, origin, compared, with, 835, observed, for, uranus, s, moon, miranda, which, has, only, three, percent, of, triton, s, surface, area, the, largest, crater, observed, on, triton, thought, to, have, been, created, by, an, impact, is, a, 27, kilometer, diameter, 17, mi, feature, called, mazomba, although, larger, craters, have, been, observed, they, are, generally, thought, to, be, volcanic, the, few, impact, craters, on, triton, are, almost, all, concentrated, in, the, leading, hemisphere, that, facing, the, direction, of, the, orbital, motion, with, the, majority, concentrated, around, the, equator, between, 30, and, 70, longitude, resulting, from, material, swept, up, from, orbit, around, neptune, because, it, orbits, with, one, side, permanently, facing, the, planet, astronomers, expect, that, triton, should, have, fewer, impacts, on, its, trailing, hemisphere, due, to, impacts, on, the, leading, hemisphere, being, more, frequent, and, more, violent, voyager, 2, imaged, only, 40, of, triton, s, surface, so, this, remains, uncertain, however, the, observed, cratering, asymmetry, exceeds, what, can, be, explained, based, on, the, impactor, populations, and, implies, a, younger, surface, age, for, the, crater, free, regions, 6, million, years, old, than, for, the, cratered, regions, 50, million, years, old, the, orbital, properties, of, triton, were, already, determined, with, high, accuracy, in, the, 19th, century, it, was, found, to, have, a, retrograde, orbit, at, a, very, high, angle, of, inclination, to, the, plane, of, neptune, s, orbit, the, first, detailed, observations, of, triton, were, not, made, until, 1930, little, was, known, about, the, satellite, until, voyager, 2, flew, by, in, 1989, before, the, flyby, of, voyager, 2, astronomers, suspected, that, triton, might, have, liquid, nitrogen, seas, and, a, nitrogen, methane, atmosphere, with, a, density, as, much, as, 30, that, of, earth, like, the, famous, overestimates, of, the, atmospheric, density, of, mars, this, proved, incorrect, as, with, mars, a, denser, atmosphere, is, postulated, for, its, early, history, the, first, attempt, to, measure, the, diameter, of, triton, was, made, by, gerard, kuiper, in, 1954, he, obtained, a, value, of, 3, 800, km, subsequent, measurement, attempts, arrived, at, values, ranging, from, 2, 500, to, 6, 000, km, or, from, slightly, smaller, than, the, moon, 3, 474, 2, km, to, nearly, half, the, diameter, of, earth, data, from, the, approach, of, voyager, 2, to, neptune, on, august, 25, 1989, led, to, a, more, accurate, estimate, of, triton, s, diameter, 2, 706, km, in, the, 1990s, various, observations, from, earth, were, made, of, the, limb, of, triton, using, the, occultation, of, nearby, stars, which, indicated, the, presence, of, an, atmosphere, and, an, exotic, surface, observations, in, late, 1997, suggest, that, triton, is, heating, up, and, the, atmosphere, has, become, significantly, denser, since, voyager, 2, flew, past, in, 1989, new, concepts, for, missions, to, the, neptune, system, to, be, conducted, in, the, 2010s, were, proposed, by, nasa, scientists, on, numerous, occasions, over, the, last, decades, all, of, them, identified, triton, as, being, a, prime, target, and, a, separate, triton, lander, comparable, to, the, huygens, probe, for, titan, was, frequently, included, in, those, plans, no, efforts, aimed, at, neptune, and, triton, went, beyond, the, proposal, phase, and, nasa, s, funding, for, missions, to, the, outer, solar, system, is, currently, focused, on, the, jupiter, and, saturn, systems, a, proposed, lander, mission, to, triton, called, triton, hopper, would, mine, nitrogen, ice, from, the, surface, of, triton, and, process, it, to, be, used, as, a, propellant, for, a, small, rocket, enabling, it, to, fly, or, hop, across, the, surface, another, concept, involving, a, flyby, was, formally, proposed, in, 2019, as, part, of, nasa, s, discovery, program, under, the, name, trident, neptune, odyssey, is, a, mission, concept, for, a, neptune, orbiter, with, a, focus, on, triton, being, studied, beginning, april, 2021, as, a, possible, large, strategic, science, mission, by, nasa, that, would, launch, in, 2033, and, arrive, at, the, neptune, system, in, 2049, two, lower, cost, mission, concepts, were, subsequently, developed, for, the, new, frontiers, program, the, first, the, following, june, and, the, second, in, 2023, the, first, is, triton, ocean, world, surveyor, which, would, launch, in, 2031, and, arrive, in, 2047, and, the, second, is, nautilus, which, would, launch, august, 2042, and, arrive, in, april, 2057
