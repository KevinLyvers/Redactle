a, gamma, ray, also, known, as, gamma, radiation, symbol, is, a, penetrating, form, of, electromagnetic, radiation, arising, from, the, radioactive, decay, of, atomic, nuclei, it, consists, of, the, shortest, wavelength, electromagnetic, waves, typically, shorter, than, those, of, x, rays, with, frequencies, above, 30, exahertz, 3, 10, 19, hz, and, wavelengths, less, than, 10, picometers, 1, 10, 11, m, gamma, ray, photons, have, the, highest, photon, energy, of, any, form, of, electromagnetic, radiation, paul, villard, a, french, chemist, and, physicist, discovered, gamma, radiation, in, 1900, while, studying, radiation, emitted, by, radium, in, 1903, ernest, rutherford, named, this, radiation, gamma, rays, based, on, their, relatively, strong, penetration, of, matter, in, 1900, he, had, already, named, two, less, penetrating, types, of, decay, radiation, discovered, by, henri, becquerel, alpha, rays, and, beta, rays, in, ascending, order, of, penetrating, power, gamma, rays, from, radioactive, decay, are, in, the, energy, range, from, a, few, kilo, electronvolts, kev, to, approximately, 8, megaelectronvolts, mev, corresponding, to, the, typical, energy, levels, in, nuclei, with, reasonably, long, lifetimes, the, energy, spectrum, of, gamma, rays, can, be, used, to, identify, the, decaying, radionuclides, using, gamma, spectroscopy, very, high, energy, gamma, rays, in, the, 100, 1000, teraelectronvolt, tev, range, have, been, observed, from, astronomical, sources, such, as, the, cygnus, x, 3, microquasar, natural, sources, of, gamma, rays, originating, on, earth, are, mostly, a, result, of, radioactive, decay, and, secondary, radiation, from, atmospheric, interactions, with, cosmic, ray, particles, however, there, are, other, rare, natural, sources, such, as, terrestrial, gamma, ray, flashes, which, produce, gamma, rays, from, electron, action, upon, the, nucleus, notable, artificial, sources, of, gamma, rays, include, fission, such, as, that, which, occurs, in, nuclear, reactors, and, high, energy, physics, experiments, such, as, neutral, pion, decay, and, nuclear, fusion, the, energy, ranges, of, gamma, rays, and, x, rays, overlap, in, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, so, the, terminology, for, these, electromagnetic, waves, varies, between, scientific, disciplines, in, some, fields, of, physics, they, are, distinguished, by, their, origin, gamma, rays, are, created, by, nuclear, decay, while, x, rays, originate, outside, the, nucleus, in, astrophysics, gamma, rays, are, conventionally, defined, as, having, photon, energies, above, 100, kev, and, are, the, subject, of, gamma, ray, astronomy, while, radiation, below, 100, kev, is, classified, as, x, rays, and, is, the, subject, of, x, ray, astronomy, gamma, rays, are, ionizing, radiation, and, are, thus, hazardous, to, life, they, can, cause, dna, mutations, cancer, and, tumors, and, at, high, doses, burns, and, radiation, sickness, due, to, their, high, penetration, power, they, can, damage, bone, marrow, and, internal, organs, unlike, alpha, and, beta, rays, they, easily, pass, through, the, body, and, thus, pose, a, formidable, radiation, protection, challenge, requiring, shielding, made, from, dense, materials, such, as, lead, or, concrete, on, earth, the, magnetosphere, protects, life, from, most, types, of, lethal, cosmic, radiation, other, than, gamma, rays, the, first, gamma, ray, source, to, be, discovered, was, the, radioactive, decay, process, called, gamma, decay, in, this, type, of, decay, an, excited, nucleus, emits, a, gamma, ray, almost, immediately, upon, formation, paul, villard, a, french, chemist, and, physicist, discovered, gamma, radiation, in, 1900, while, studying, radiation, emitted, from, radium, villard, knew, that, his, described, radiation, was, more, powerful, than, previously, described, types, of, rays, from, radium, which, included, beta, rays, first, noted, as, radioactivity, by, henri, becquerel, in, 1896, and, alpha, rays, discovered, as, a, less, penetrating, form, of, radiation, by, rutherford, in, 1899, however, villard, did, not, consider, naming, them, as, a, different, fundamental, type, later, in, 1903, villard, s, radiation, was, recognized, as, being, of, a, type, fundamentally, different, from, previously, named, rays, by, ernest, rutherford, who, named, villard, s, rays, gamma, rays, by, analogy, with, the, beta, and, alpha, rays, that, rutherford, had, differentiated, in, 1899, the, rays, emitted, by, radioactive, elements, were, named, in, order, of, their, power, to, penetrate, various, materials, using, the, first, three, letters, of, the, greek, alphabet, alpha, rays, as, the, least, penetrating, followed, by, beta, rays, followed, by, gamma, rays, as, the, most, penetrating, rutherford, also, noted, that, gamma, rays, were, not, deflected, or, at, least, not, easily, deflected, by, a, magnetic, field, another, property, making, them, unlike, alpha, and, beta, rays, gamma, rays, were, first, thought, to, be, particles, with, mass, like, alpha, and, beta, rays, rutherford, initially, believed, that, they, might, be, extremely, fast, beta, particles, but, their, failure, to, be, deflected, by, a, magnetic, field, indicated, that, they, had, no, charge, in, 1914, gamma, rays, were, observed, to, be, reflected, from, crystal, surfaces, proving, that, they, were, electromagnetic, radiation, rutherford, and, his, co, worker, edward, andrade, measured, the, wavelengths, of, gamma, rays, from, radium, and, found, they, were, similar, to, x, rays, but, with, shorter, wavelengths, and, thus, higher, frequency, this, was, eventually, recognized, as, giving, them, more, energy, per, photon, as, soon, as, the, latter, term, became, generally, accepted, a, gamma, decay, was, then, understood, to, usually, emit, a, gamma, photon, natural, sources, of, gamma, rays, on, earth, include, gamma, decay, from, naturally, occurring, radioisotopes, such, as, potassium, 40, and, also, as, a, secondary, radiation, from, various, atmospheric, interactions, with, cosmic, ray, particles, natural, terrestrial, sources, that, produce, gamma, rays, include, lightning, strikes, and, terrestrial, gamma, ray, flashes, which, produce, high, energy, emissions, from, natural, high, energy, voltages, gamma, rays, are, produced, by, a, number, of, astronomical, processes, in, which, very, high, energy, electrons, are, produced, such, electrons, produce, secondary, gamma, rays, by, the, mechanisms, of, bremsstrahlung, inverse, compton, scattering, and, synchrotron, radiation, a, large, fraction, of, such, astronomical, gamma, rays, are, screened, by, earth, s, atmosphere, notable, artificial, sources, of, gamma, rays, include, fission, such, as, occurs, in, nuclear, reactors, as, well, as, high, energy, physics, experiments, such, as, neutral, pion, decay, and, nuclear, fusion, a, sample, of, gamma, ray, emitting, material, that, is, used, for, irradiating, or, imaging, is, known, as, a, gamma, source, it, is, also, called, a, radioactive, source, isotope, source, or, radiation, source, though, these, more, general, terms, also, apply, to, alpha, and, beta, emitting, devices, gamma, sources, are, usually, sealed, to, prevent, radioactive, contamination, and, transported, in, heavy, shielding, gamma, rays, are, produced, during, gamma, decay, which, normally, occurs, after, other, forms, of, decay, occur, such, as, alpha, or, beta, decay, a, radioactive, nucleus, can, decay, by, the, emission, of, an, or, particle, the, daughter, nucleus, that, results, is, usually, left, in, an, excited, state, it, can, then, decay, to, a, lower, energy, state, by, emitting, a, gamma, ray, photon, in, a, process, called, gamma, decay, the, emission, of, a, gamma, ray, from, an, excited, nucleus, typically, requires, only, 10, 12, seconds, gamma, decay, may, also, follow, nuclear, reactions, such, as, neutron, capture, nuclear, fission, or, nuclear, fusion, gamma, decay, is, also, a, mode, of, relaxation, of, many, excited, states, of, atomic, nuclei, following, other, types, of, radioactive, decay, such, as, beta, decay, so, long, as, these, states, possess, the, necessary, component, of, nuclear, spin, when, high, energy, gamma, rays, electrons, or, protons, bombard, materials, the, excited, atoms, emit, characteristic, secondary, gamma, rays, which, are, products, of, the, creation, of, excited, nuclear, states, in, the, bombarded, atoms, such, transitions, a, form, of, nuclear, gamma, fluorescence, form, a, topic, in, nuclear, physics, called, gamma, spectroscopy, formation, of, fluorescent, gamma, rays, are, a, rapid, subtype, of, radioactive, gamma, decay, in, certain, cases, the, excited, nuclear, state, that, follows, the, emission, of, a, beta, particle, or, other, type, of, excitation, may, be, more, stable, than, average, and, is, termed, a, metastable, excited, state, if, its, decay, takes, at, least, 100, to, 1000, times, longer, than, the, average, 10, 12, seconds, such, relatively, long, lived, excited, nuclei, are, termed, nuclear, isomers, and, their, decays, are, termed, isomeric, transitions, such, nuclei, have, half, lifes, that, are, more, easily, measurable, and, rare, nuclear, isomers, are, able, to, stay, in, their, excited, state, for, minutes, hours, days, or, occasionally, far, longer, before, emitting, a, gamma, ray, the, process, of, isomeric, transition, is, therefore, similar, to, any, gamma, emission, but, differs, in, that, it, involves, the, intermediate, metastable, excited, state, s, of, the, nuclei, metastable, states, are, often, characterized, by, high, nuclear, spin, requiring, a, change, in, spin, of, several, units, or, more, with, gamma, decay, instead, of, a, single, unit, transition, that, occurs, in, only, 10, 12, seconds, the, rate, of, gamma, decay, is, also, slowed, when, the, energy, of, excitation, of, the, nucleus, is, small, an, emitted, gamma, ray, from, any, type, of, excited, state, may, transfer, its, energy, directly, to, any, electrons, but, most, probably, to, one, of, the, k, shell, electrons, of, the, atom, causing, it, to, be, ejected, from, that, atom, in, a, process, generally, termed, the, photoelectric, effect, external, gamma, rays, and, ultraviolet, rays, may, also, cause, this, effect, the, photoelectric, effect, should, not, be, confused, with, the, internal, conversion, process, in, which, a, gamma, ray, photon, is, not, produced, as, an, intermediate, particle, rather, a, virtual, gamma, ray, may, be, thought, to, mediate, the, process, one, example, of, gamma, ray, production, due, to, radionuclide, decay, is, the, decay, scheme, for, cobalt, 60, as, illustrated, in, the, accompanying, diagram, first, 60, co, decays, to, excited, 60, ni, by, beta, decay, emission, of, an, electron, of, 0, 31, mev, then, the, excited, 60, ni, decays, to, the, ground, state, see, nuclear, shell, model, by, emitting, gamma, rays, in, succession, of, 1, 17, mev, followed, by, 1, 33, mev, this, path, is, followed, 99, 88, of, the, time, another, example, is, the, alpha, decay, of, 241, am, to, form, 237, np, which, is, followed, by, gamma, emission, in, some, cases, the, gamma, emission, spectrum, of, the, daughter, nucleus, is, quite, simple, e, g, 60, co, 60, ni, while, in, other, cases, such, as, with, 241, am, 237, np, and, 192, ir, 192, pt, the, gamma, emission, spectrum, is, complex, revealing, that, a, series, of, nuclear, energy, levels, exist, gamma, rays, are, produced, in, many, processes, of, particle, physics, typically, gamma, rays, are, the, products, of, neutral, systems, which, decay, through, electromagnetic, interactions, rather, than, a, weak, or, strong, interaction, for, example, in, an, electron, positron, annihilation, the, usual, products, are, two, gamma, ray, photons, if, the, annihilating, electron, and, positron, are, at, rest, each, of, the, resulting, gamma, rays, has, an, energy, of, 511, kev, and, frequency, of, 1, 24, 10, 20, hz, similarly, a, neutral, pion, most, often, decays, into, two, photons, many, other, hadrons, and, massive, bosons, also, decay, electromagnetically, high, energy, physics, experiments, such, as, the, large, hadron, collider, accordingly, employ, substantial, radiation, shielding, because, subatomic, particles, mostly, have, far, shorter, wavelengths, than, atomic, nuclei, particle, physics, gamma, rays, are, generally, several, orders, of, magnitude, more, energetic, than, nuclear, decay, gamma, rays, since, gamma, rays, are, at, the, top, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, in, terms, of, energy, all, extremely, high, energy, photons, are, gamma, rays, for, example, a, photon, having, the, planck, energy, would, be, a, gamma, ray, a, few, gamma, rays, in, astronomy, are, known, to, arise, from, gamma, decay, see, discussion, of, sn1987a, but, most, do, not, photons, from, astrophysical, sources, that, carry, energy, in, the, gamma, radiation, range, are, often, explicitly, called, gamma, radiation, in, addition, to, nuclear, emissions, they, are, often, produced, by, sub, atomic, particle, and, particle, photon, interactions, those, include, electron, positron, annihilation, neutral, pion, decay, bremsstrahlung, inverse, compton, scattering, and, synchrotron, radiation, in, october, 2017, scientists, from, various, european, universities, proposed, a, means, for, sources, of, gev, photons, using, lasers, as, exciters, through, a, controlled, interplay, between, the, cascade, and, anomalous, radiative, trapping, thunderstorms, can, produce, a, brief, pulse, of, gamma, radiation, called, a, terrestrial, gamma, ray, flash, these, gamma, rays, are, thought, to, be, produced, by, high, intensity, static, electric, fields, accelerating, electrons, which, then, produce, gamma, rays, by, bremsstrahlung, as, they, collide, with, and, are, slowed, by, atoms, in, the, atmosphere, gamma, rays, up, to, 100, mev, can, be, emitted, by, terrestrial, thunderstorms, and, were, discovered, by, space, borne, observatories, this, raises, the, possibility, of, health, risks, to, passengers, and, crew, on, aircraft, flying, in, or, near, thunderclouds, the, most, effusive, solar, flares, emit, across, the, entire, em, spectrum, including, rays, the, first, confident, observation, occurred, in, 1972, extraterrestrial, high, energy, gamma, rays, include, the, gamma, ray, background, produced, when, cosmic, rays, either, high, speed, electrons, or, protons, collide, with, ordinary, matter, producing, pair, production, gamma, rays, at, 511, kev, alternatively, bremsstrahlung, are, produced, at, energies, of, tens, of, mev, or, more, when, cosmic, ray, electrons, interact, with, nuclei, of, sufficiently, high, atomic, number, see, gamma, ray, image, of, the, moon, near, the, end, of, this, article, for, illustration, the, gamma, ray, sky, see, illustration, at, right, is, dominated, by, the, more, common, and, longer, term, production, of, gamma, rays, that, emanate, from, pulsars, within, the, milky, way, sources, from, the, rest, of, the, sky, are, mostly, quasars, pulsars, are, thought, to, be, neutron, stars, with, magnetic, fields, that, produce, focused, beams, of, radiation, and, are, far, less, energetic, more, common, and, much, nearer, sources, typically, seen, only, in, our, own, galaxy, than, are, quasars, or, the, rarer, gamma, ray, burst, sources, of, gamma, rays, pulsars, have, relatively, long, lived, magnetic, fields, that, produce, focused, beams, of, relativistic, speed, charged, particles, which, emit, gamma, rays, bremsstrahlung, when, those, strike, gas, or, dust, in, their, nearby, medium, and, are, decelerated, this, is, a, similar, mechanism, to, the, production, of, high, energy, photons, in, megavoltage, radiation, therapy, machines, see, bremsstrahlung, inverse, compton, scattering, in, which, charged, particles, usually, electrons, impart, energy, to, low, energy, photons, boosting, them, to, higher, energy, photons, such, impacts, of, photons, on, relativistic, charged, particle, beams, is, another, possible, mechanism, of, gamma, ray, production, neutron, stars, with, a, very, high, magnetic, field, magnetars, thought, to, produce, astronomical, soft, gamma, repeaters, are, another, relatively, long, lived, star, powered, source, of, gamma, radiation, more, powerful, gamma, rays, from, very, distant, quasars, and, closer, active, galaxies, are, thought, to, have, a, gamma, ray, production, source, similar, to, a, particle, accelerator, high, energy, electrons, produced, by, the, quasar, and, subjected, to, inverse, compton, scattering, synchrotron, radiation, or, bremsstrahlung, are, the, likely, source, of, the, gamma, rays, from, those, objects, it, is, thought, that, a, supermassive, black, hole, at, the, center, of, such, galaxies, provides, the, power, source, that, intermittently, destroys, stars, and, focuses, the, resulting, charged, particles, into, beams, that, emerge, from, their, rotational, poles, when, those, beams, interact, with, gas, dust, and, lower, energy, photons, they, produce, x, rays, and, gamma, rays, these, sources, are, known, to, fluctuate, with, durations, of, a, few, weeks, suggesting, their, relatively, small, size, less, than, a, few, light, weeks, across, such, sources, of, gamma, and, x, rays, are, the, most, commonly, visible, high, intensity, sources, outside, the, milky, way, galaxy, they, shine, not, in, bursts, see, illustration, but, relatively, continuously, when, viewed, with, gamma, ray, telescopes, the, power, of, a, typical, quasar, is, about, 10, 40, watts, a, small, fraction, of, which, is, gamma, radiation, much, of, the, rest, is, emitted, as, electromagnetic, waves, of, all, frequencies, including, radio, waves, the, most, intense, sources, of, gamma, rays, are, also, the, most, intense, sources, of, any, type, of, electromagnetic, radiation, presently, known, they, are, the, long, duration, burst, sources, of, gamma, rays, in, astronomy, long, in, this, context, meaning, a, few, tens, of, seconds, and, they, are, rare, compared, with, the, sources, discussed, above, by, contrast, short, gamma, ray, bursts, of, two, seconds, or, less, which, are, not, associated, with, supernovae, are, thought, to, produce, gamma, rays, during, the, collision, of, pairs, of, neutron, stars, or, a, neutron, star, and, a, black, hole, the, so, called, long, duration, gamma, ray, bursts, produce, a, total, energy, output, of, about, 10, 44, joules, as, much, energy, as, the, sun, will, produce, in, its, entire, life, time, but, in, a, period, of, only, 20, to, 40, seconds, gamma, rays, are, approximately, 50, of, the, total, energy, output, the, leading, hypotheses, for, the, mechanism, of, production, of, these, highest, known, intensity, beams, of, radiation, are, inverse, compton, scattering, and, synchrotron, radiation, from, high, energy, charged, particles, these, processes, occur, as, relativistic, charged, particles, leave, the, region, of, the, event, horizon, of, a, newly, formed, black, hole, created, during, supernova, explosion, the, beam, of, particles, moving, at, relativistic, speeds, are, focused, for, a, few, tens, of, seconds, by, the, magnetic, field, of, the, exploding, hypernova, the, fusion, explosion, of, the, hypernova, drives, the, energetics, of, the, process, if, the, narrowly, directed, beam, happens, to, be, pointed, toward, the, earth, it, shines, at, gamma, ray, frequencies, with, such, intensity, that, it, can, be, detected, even, at, distances, of, up, to, 10, billion, light, years, which, is, close, to, the, edge, of, the, visible, universe, due, to, their, penetrating, nature, gamma, rays, require, large, amounts, of, shielding, mass, to, reduce, them, to, levels, which, are, not, harmful, to, living, cells, in, contrast, to, alpha, particles, which, can, be, stopped, by, paper, or, skin, and, beta, particles, which, can, be, shielded, by, thin, aluminium, gamma, rays, are, best, absorbed, by, materials, with, high, atomic, numbers, z, and, high, density, which, contribute, to, the, total, stopping, power, because, of, this, a, lead, high, z, shield, is, 20, 30, better, as, a, gamma, shield, than, an, equal, mass, of, another, low, z, shielding, material, such, as, aluminium, concrete, water, or, soil, lead, s, major, advantage, is, not, in, lower, weight, but, rather, its, compactness, due, to, its, higher, density, protective, clothing, goggles, and, respirators, can, protect, from, internal, contact, with, or, ingestion, of, alpha, or, beta, emitting, particles, but, provide, no, protection, from, gamma, radiation, from, external, sources, the, higher, the, energy, of, the, gamma, rays, the, thicker, the, shielding, made, from, the, same, shielding, material, is, required, materials, for, shielding, gamma, rays, are, typically, measured, by, the, thickness, required, to, reduce, the, intensity, of, the, gamma, rays, by, one, half, the, half, value, layer, or, hvl, for, example, gamma, rays, that, require, 1, cm, 0, 4, inch, of, lead, to, reduce, their, intensity, by, 50, will, also, have, their, intensity, reduced, in, half, by, 4, 1, cm, of, granite, rock, 6, cm, 2, 5, inches, of, concrete, or, 9, cm, 3, 5, inches, of, packed, soil, however, the, mass, of, this, much, concrete, or, soil, is, only, 20, 30, greater, than, that, of, lead, with, the, same, absorption, capability, depleted, uranium, is, sometimes, used, for, shielding, in, portable, gamma, ray, sources, due, to, the, smaller, half, value, layer, when, compared, to, lead, around, 0, 6, times, the, thickness, for, common, gamma, ray, sources, i, e, iridium, 192, and, cobalt, 60, and, cheaper, cost, compared, to, tungsten, in, a, nuclear, power, plant, shielding, can, be, provided, by, steel, and, concrete, in, the, pressure, and, particle, containment, vessel, while, water, provides, a, radiation, shielding, of, fuel, rods, during, storage, or, transport, into, the, reactor, core, the, loss, of, water, or, removal, of, a, hot, fuel, assembly, into, the, air, would, result, in, much, higher, radiation, levels, than, when, kept, under, water, when, a, gamma, ray, passes, through, matter, the, probability, for, absorption, is, proportional, to, the, thickness, of, the, layer, the, density, of, the, material, and, the, absorption, cross, section, of, the, material, the, total, absorption, shows, an, exponential, decrease, of, intensity, with, distance, from, the, incident, surface, where, x, is, the, thickness, of, the, material, from, the, incident, surface, n, is, the, absorption, coefficient, measured, in, cm, 1, n, the, number, of, atoms, per, cm, 3, of, the, material, atomic, density, and, the, absorption, cross, section, in, cm, 2, as, it, passes, through, matter, gamma, radiation, ionizes, via, three, processes, the, secondary, electrons, and, or, positrons, produced, in, any, of, these, three, processes, frequently, have, enough, energy, to, produce, much, ionization, themselves, additionally, gamma, rays, particularly, high, energy, ones, can, interact, with, atomic, nuclei, resulting, in, ejection, of, particles, in, photodisintegration, or, in, some, cases, even, nuclear, fission, photofission, high, energy, from, 80, gev, to, 10, tev, gamma, rays, arriving, from, far, distant, quasars, are, used, to, estimate, the, extragalactic, background, light, in, the, universe, the, highest, energy, rays, interact, more, readily, with, the, background, light, photons, and, thus, the, density, of, the, background, light, may, be, estimated, by, analyzing, the, incoming, gamma, ray, spectra, gamma, spectroscopy, is, the, study, of, the, energetic, transitions, in, atomic, nuclei, which, are, generally, associated, with, the, absorption, or, emission, of, gamma, rays, as, in, optical, spectroscopy, see, franck, condon, effect, the, absorption, of, gamma, rays, by, a, nucleus, is, especially, likely, i, e, peaks, in, a, resonance, when, the, energy, of, the, gamma, ray, is, the, same, as, that, of, an, energy, transition, in, the, nucleus, in, the, case, of, gamma, rays, such, a, resonance, is, seen, in, the, technique, of, m, ssbauer, spectroscopy, in, the, m, ssbauer, effect, the, narrow, resonance, absorption, for, nuclear, gamma, absorption, can, be, successfully, attained, by, physically, immobilizing, atomic, nuclei, in, a, crystal, the, immobilization, of, nuclei, at, both, ends, of, a, gamma, resonance, interaction, is, required, so, that, no, gamma, energy, is, lost, to, the, kinetic, energy, of, recoiling, nuclei, at, either, the, emitting, or, absorbing, end, of, a, gamma, transition, such, loss, of, energy, causes, gamma, ray, resonance, absorption, to, fail, however, when, emitted, gamma, rays, carry, essentially, all, of, the, energy, of, the, atomic, nuclear, de, excitation, that, produces, them, this, energy, is, also, sufficient, to, excite, the, same, energy, state, in, a, second, immobilized, nucleus, of, the, same, type, gamma, rays, provide, information, about, some, of, the, most, energetic, phenomena, in, the, universe, however, they, are, largely, absorbed, by, the, earth, s, atmosphere, instruments, aboard, high, altitude, balloons, and, satellites, missions, such, as, the, fermi, gamma, ray, space, telescope, provide, our, only, view, of, the, universe, in, gamma, rays, gamma, induced, molecular, changes, can, also, be, used, to, alter, the, properties, of, semi, precious, stones, and, is, often, used, to, change, white, topaz, into, blue, topaz, non, contact, industrial, sensors, commonly, use, sources, of, gamma, radiation, in, refining, mining, chemicals, food, soaps, and, detergents, and, pulp, and, paper, industries, for, the, measurement, of, levels, density, and, thicknesses, gamma, ray, sensors, are, also, used, for, measuring, the, fluid, levels, in, water, and, oil, industries, typically, these, use, co, 60, or, cs, 137, isotopes, as, the, radiation, source, in, the, us, gamma, ray, detectors, are, beginning, to, be, used, as, part, of, the, container, security, initiative, csi, these, machines, are, advertised, to, be, able, to, scan, 30, containers, per, hour, gamma, radiation, is, often, used, to, kill, living, organisms, in, a, process, called, irradiation, applications, of, this, include, the, sterilization, of, medical, equipment, as, an, alternative, to, autoclaves, or, chemical, means, the, removal, of, decay, causing, bacteria, from, many, foods, and, the, prevention, of, the, sprouting, of, fruit, and, vegetables, to, maintain, freshness, and, flavor, despite, their, cancer, causing, properties, gamma, rays, are, also, used, to, treat, some, types, of, cancer, since, the, rays, also, kill, cancer, cells, in, the, procedure, called, gamma, knife, surgery, multiple, concentrated, beams, of, gamma, rays, are, directed, to, the, growth, in, order, to, kill, the, cancerous, cells, the, beams, are, aimed, from, different, angles, to, concentrate, the, radiation, on, the, growth, while, minimizing, damage, to, surrounding, tissues, gamma, rays, are, also, used, for, diagnostic, purposes, in, nuclear, medicine, in, imaging, techniques, a, number, of, different, gamma, emitting, radioisotopes, are, used, for, example, in, a, pet, scan, a, radiolabeled, sugar, called, fluorodeoxyglucose, emits, positrons, that, are, annihilated, by, electrons, producing, pairs, of, gamma, rays, that, highlight, cancer, as, the, cancer, often, has, a, higher, metabolic, rate, than, the, surrounding, tissues, the, most, common, gamma, emitter, used, in, medical, applications, is, the, nuclear, isomer, technetium, 99m, which, emits, gamma, rays, in, the, same, energy, range, as, diagnostic, x, rays, when, this, radionuclide, tracer, is, administered, to, a, patient, a, gamma, camera, can, be, used, to, form, an, image, of, the, radioisotope, s, distribution, by, detecting, the, gamma, radiation, emitted, see, also, spect, depending, on, which, molecule, has, been, labeled, with, the, tracer, such, techniques, can, be, employed, to, diagnose, a, wide, range, of, conditions, for, example, the, spread, of, cancer, to, the, bones, via, bone, scan, gamma, rays, cause, damage, at, a, cellular, level, and, are, penetrating, causing, diffuse, damage, throughout, the, body, however, they, are, less, ionising, than, alpha, or, beta, particles, which, are, less, penetrating, low, levels, of, gamma, rays, cause, a, stochastic, health, risk, which, for, radiation, dose, assessment, is, defined, as, the, probability, of, cancer, induction, and, genetic, damage, the, international, commission, on, radiological, protection, says, in, the, low, dose, range, below, about, 100, msv, it, is, scientifically, plausible, to, assume, that, the, incidence, of, cancer, or, heritable, effects, will, rise, in, direct, proportion, to, an, increase, in, the, equivalent, dose, in, the, relevant, organs, and, tissues, 51, high, doses, produce, deterministic, effects, which, is, the, severity, of, acute, tissue, damage, that, is, certain, to, happen, these, effects, are, compared, to, the, physical, quantity, absorbed, dose, measured, by, the, unit, gray, gy, 61, when, gamma, radiation, breaks, dna, molecules, a, cell, may, be, able, to, repair, the, damaged, genetic, material, within, limits, however, a, study, of, rothkamm, and, lobrich, has, shown, that, this, repair, process, works, well, after, high, dose, exposure, but, is, much, slower, in, the, case, of, a, low, dose, exposure, studies, have, shown, low, dose, gamma, radiation, may, be, enough, to, cause, cancer, in, a, study, of, mice, they, were, given, human, relevant, low, dose, gamma, radiation, with, genotoxic, effects, 45, days, after, continuous, low, dose, gamma, radiation, with, significant, increases, of, chromosomal, damage, dna, lesions, and, phenotypic, mutations, in, blood, cells, of, irradiated, animals, covering, the, three, types, of, genotoxic, activity, another, study, studied, the, effects, of, acute, ionizing, gamma, radiation, in, rats, up, to, 10, gy, and, who, ended, up, showing, acute, oxidative, protein, damage, dna, damage, cardiac, troponin, t, carbonylation, and, long, term, cardiomyopathy, the, natural, outdoor, exposure, in, the, united, kingdom, ranges, from, 0, 1, to, 0, 5, sv, h, with, significant, increase, around, known, nuclear, and, contaminated, sites, natural, exposure, to, gamma, rays, is, about, 1, to, 2, msv, per, year, and, the, average, total, amount, of, radiation, received, in, one, year, per, inhabitant, in, the, usa, is, 3, 6, msv, there, is, a, small, increase, in, the, dose, due, to, naturally, occurring, gamma, radiation, around, small, particles, of, high, atomic, number, materials, in, the, human, body, caused, by, the, photoelectric, effect, by, comparison, the, radiation, dose, from, chest, radiography, about, 0, 06, msv, is, a, fraction, of, the, annual, naturally, occurring, background, radiation, dose, a, chest, ct, delivers, 5, to, 8, msv, a, whole, body, pet, ct, scan, can, deliver, 14, to, 32, msv, depending, on, the, protocol, the, dose, from, fluoroscopy, of, the, stomach, is, much, higher, approximately, 50, msv, 14, times, the, annual, background, an, acute, full, body, equivalent, single, exposure, dose, of, 1, sv, 1000, msv, or, 1, gy, will, cause, mild, symptoms, of, acute, radiation, sickness, such, as, nausea, and, vomiting, and, a, dose, of, 2, 0, 3, 5, sv, 2, 0, 3, 5, gy, causes, more, severe, symptoms, i, e, nausea, diarrhea, hair, loss, hemorrhaging, and, inability, to, fight, infections, and, will, cause, death, in, a, sizable, number, of, cases, about, 10, to, 35, without, medical, treatment, a, dose, of, 3, 5, sv, 3, 5, gy, is, considered, approximately, the, ld, 50, or, the, lethal, dose, for, 50, of, exposed, population, for, an, acute, exposure, to, radiation, even, with, standard, medical, treatment, a, dose, higher, than, 5, sv, 5, gy, brings, an, increasing, chance, of, death, above, 50, above, 7, 5, 10, sv, 7, 5, 10, gy, to, the, entire, body, even, extraordinary, treatment, such, as, bone, marrow, transplants, will, not, prevent, the, death, of, the, individual, exposed, see, radiation, poisoning, doses, much, larger, than, this, may, however, be, delivered, to, selected, parts, of, the, body, in, the, course, of, radiation, therapy, for, low, dose, exposure, for, example, among, nuclear, workers, who, receive, an, average, yearly, radiation, dose, of, 19, msv, the, risk, of, dying, from, cancer, excluding, leukemia, increases, by, 2, percent, for, a, dose, of, 100, msv, the, risk, increase, is, 10, percent, by, comparison, risk, of, dying, from, cancer, was, increased, by, 32, percent, for, the, survivors, of, the, atomic, bombing, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, the, following, table, shows, radiation, quantities, in, si, and, non, si, units, the, measure, of, the, ionizing, effect, of, gamma, and, x, rays, in, dry, air, is, called, the, exposure, for, which, a, legacy, unit, the, r, ntgen, was, used, from, 1928, this, has, been, replaced, by, kerma, now, mainly, used, for, instrument, calibration, purposes, but, not, for, received, dose, effect, the, effect, of, gamma, and, other, ionizing, radiation, on, living, tissue, is, more, closely, related, to, the, amount, of, energy, deposited, in, tissue, rather, than, the, ionisation, of, air, and, replacement, radiometric, units, and, quantities, for, radiation, protection, have, been, defined, and, developed, from, 1953, onwards, these, are, the, conventional, distinction, between, x, rays, and, gamma, rays, has, changed, over, time, originally, the, electromagnetic, radiation, emitted, by, x, ray, tubes, almost, invariably, had, a, longer, wavelength, than, the, radiation, gamma, rays, emitted, by, radioactive, nuclei, older, literature, distinguished, between, x, and, gamma, radiation, on, the, basis, of, wavelength, with, radiation, shorter, than, some, arbitrary, wavelength, such, as, 10, 11, m, defined, as, gamma, rays, since, the, energy, of, photons, is, proportional, to, their, frequency, and, inversely, proportional, to, wavelength, this, past, distinction, between, x, rays, and, gamma, rays, can, also, be, thought, of, in, terms, of, its, energy, with, gamma, rays, considered, to, be, higher, energy, electromagnetic, radiation, than, are, x, rays, however, since, current, artificial, sources, are, now, able, to, duplicate, any, electromagnetic, radiation, that, originates, in, the, nucleus, as, well, as, far, higher, energies, the, wavelengths, characteristic, of, radioactive, gamma, ray, sources, vs, other, types, now, completely, overlap, thus, gamma, rays, are, now, usually, distinguished, by, their, origin, x, rays, are, emitted, by, definition, by, electrons, outside, the, nucleus, while, gamma, rays, are, emitted, by, the, nucleus, exceptions, to, this, convention, occur, in, astronomy, where, gamma, decay, is, seen, in, the, afterglow, of, certain, supernovas, but, radiation, from, high, energy, processes, known, to, involve, other, radiation, sources, than, radioactive, decay, is, still, classed, as, gamma, radiation, for, example, modern, high, energy, x, rays, produced, by, linear, accelerators, for, megavoltage, treatment, in, cancer, often, have, higher, energy, 4, to, 25, mev, than, do, most, classical, gamma, rays, produced, by, nuclear, gamma, decay, one, of, the, most, common, gamma, ray, emitting, isotopes, used, in, diagnostic, nuclear, medicine, technetium, 99m, produces, gamma, radiation, of, the, same, energy, 140, kev, as, that, produced, by, diagnostic, x, ray, machines, but, of, significantly, lower, energy, than, therapeutic, photons, from, linear, particle, accelerators, in, the, medical, community, today, the, convention, that, radiation, produced, by, nuclear, decay, is, the, only, type, referred, to, as, gamma, radiation, is, still, respected, due, to, this, broad, overlap, in, energy, ranges, in, physics, the, two, types, of, electromagnetic, radiation, are, now, often, defined, by, their, origin, x, rays, are, emitted, by, electrons, either, in, orbitals, outside, of, the, nucleus, or, while, being, accelerated, to, produce, bremsstrahlung, type, radiation, while, gamma, rays, are, emitted, by, the, nucleus, or, by, means, of, other, particle, decays, or, annihilation, events, there, is, no, lower, limit, to, the, energy, of, photons, produced, by, nuclear, reactions, and, thus, ultraviolet, or, lower, energy, photons, produced, by, these, processes, would, also, be, defined, as, gamma, rays, indeed, this, happens, for, the, isomeric, transition, of, the, extremely, low, energy, isomer, 229m, th, the, only, naming, convention, that, is, still, universally, respected, is, the, rule, that, electromagnetic, radiation, that, is, known, to, be, of, atomic, nuclear, origin, is, always, referred, to, as, gamma, rays, and, never, as, x, rays, however, in, physics, and, astronomy, the, converse, convention, that, all, gamma, rays, are, considered, to, be, of, nuclear, origin, is, frequently, violated, in, astronomy, higher, energy, gamma, and, x, rays, are, defined, by, energy, since, the, processes, that, produce, them, may, be, uncertain, and, photon, energy, not, origin, determines, the, required, astronomical, detectors, needed, high, energy, photons, occur, in, nature, that, are, known, to, be, produced, by, processes, other, than, nuclear, decay, but, are, still, referred, to, as, gamma, radiation, an, example, is, gamma, rays, from, lightning, discharges, at, 10, to, 20, mev, and, known, to, be, produced, by, the, bremsstrahlung, mechanism, another, example, is, gamma, ray, bursts, now, known, to, be, produced, from, processes, too, powerful, to, involve, simple, collections, of, atoms, undergoing, radioactive, decay, this, is, part, and, parcel, of, the, general, realization, that, many, gamma, rays, produced, in, astronomical, processes, result, not, from, radioactive, decay, or, particle, annihilation, but, rather, in, non, radioactive, processes, similar, to, x, rays, although, the, gamma, rays, of, astronomy, often, come, from, non, radioactive, events, a, few, gamma, rays, in, astronomy, are, specifically, known, to, originate, from, gamma, decay, of, nuclei, as, demonstrated, by, their, spectra, and, emission, half, life, a, classic, example, is, that, of, supernova, sn, 1987a, which, emits, an, afterglow, of, gamma, ray, photons, from, the, decay, of, newly, made, radioactive, nickel, 56, and, cobalt, 56, most, gamma, rays, in, astronomy, however, arise, by, other, mechanisms
