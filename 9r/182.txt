astrometry, is, a, branch, of, astronomy, that, involves, precise, measurements, of, the, positions, and, movements, of, stars, and, other, celestial, bodies, it, provides, the, kinematics, and, physical, origin, of, the, solar, system, and, this, galaxy, the, milky, way, the, history, of, astrometry, is, linked, to, the, history, of, star, catalogues, which, gave, astronomers, reference, points, for, objects, in, the, sky, so, they, could, track, their, movements, this, can, be, dated, back, to, the, ancient, greek, astronomer, hipparchus, who, around, 190, bc, used, the, catalogue, of, his, predecessors, timocharis, and, aristillus, to, discover, earth, s, precession, in, doing, so, he, also, developed, the, brightness, scale, still, in, use, today, hipparchus, compiled, a, catalogue, with, at, least, 850, stars, and, their, positions, hipparchus, s, successor, ptolemy, included, a, catalogue, of, 1, 022, stars, in, his, work, the, almagest, giving, their, location, coordinates, and, brightness, in, the, 10th, century, the, iranian, astronomer, abd, al, rahman, al, sufi, carried, out, observations, on, the, stars, and, described, their, positions, magnitudes, and, star, color, furthermore, he, provided, drawings, for, each, constellation, which, are, depicted, in, his, book, of, fixed, stars, egyptian, mathematician, ibn, yunus, observed, more, than, 10, 000, entries, for, the, sun, s, position, for, many, years, using, a, large, astrolabe, with, a, diameter, of, nearly, 1, 4, metres, his, observations, on, eclipses, were, still, used, centuries, later, in, canadian, american, astronomer, simon, newcomb, s, investigations, on, the, motion, of, the, moon, while, his, other, observations, of, the, motions, of, the, planets, jupiter, and, saturn, inspired, french, scholar, laplace, s, obliquity, of, the, ecliptic, and, inequalities, of, jupiter, and, saturn, in, the, 15th, century, the, timurid, astronomer, ulugh, beg, compiled, the, zij, i, sultani, in, which, he, catalogued, 1, 019, stars, like, the, earlier, catalogs, of, hipparchus, and, ptolemy, ulugh, beg, s, catalogue, is, estimated, to, have, been, precise, to, within, approximately, 20, minutes, of, arc, in, the, 16th, century, danish, astronomer, tycho, brahe, used, improved, instruments, including, large, mural, instruments, to, measure, star, positions, more, accurately, than, previously, with, a, precision, of, 15, 35, arcsec, ottoman, scholar, taqi, al, din, measured, the, right, ascension, of, the, stars, at, the, constantinople, observatory, of, taqi, ad, din, using, the, observational, clock, he, invented, when, telescopes, became, commonplace, setting, circles, sped, measurements, english, astronomer, james, bradley, first, tried, to, measure, stellar, parallaxes, in, 1729, the, stellar, movement, proved, too, insignificant, for, his, telescope, but, he, instead, discovered, the, aberration, of, light, and, the, nutation, of, the, earth, s, axis, his, cataloguing, of, 3222, stars, was, refined, in, 1807, by, german, astronomer, friedrich, bessel, the, father, of, modern, astrometry, he, made, the, first, measurement, of, stellar, parallax, 0, 3, arcsec, for, the, binary, star, 61, cygni, in, 1872, british, astronomer, william, huggins, used, spectroscopy, to, measure, the, radial, velocity, of, several, prominent, stars, including, sirius, being, very, difficult, to, measure, only, about, 60, stellar, parallaxes, had, been, obtained, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, mostly, by, use, of, the, filar, micrometer, astrographs, using, astronomical, photographic, plates, sped, the, process, in, the, early, 20th, century, automated, plate, measuring, machines, and, more, sophisticated, computer, technology, of, the, 1960s, allowed, more, efficient, compilation, of, star, catalogues, started, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, project, carte, du, ciel, to, improve, star, mapping, could, not, be, finished, but, made, photography, a, common, technique, for, astrometry, in, the, 1980s, charge, coupled, devices, ccds, replaced, photographic, plates, and, reduced, optical, uncertainties, to, one, milliarcsecond, this, technology, made, astrometry, less, expensive, opening, the, field, to, an, amateur, audience, in, 1989, the, european, space, agency, s, hipparcos, satellite, took, astrometry, into, orbit, where, it, could, be, less, affected, by, mechanical, forces, of, the, earth, and, optical, distortions, from, its, atmosphere, operated, from, 1989, to, 1993, hipparcos, measured, large, and, small, angles, on, the, sky, with, much, greater, precision, than, any, previous, optical, telescopes, during, its, 4, year, run, the, positions, parallaxes, and, proper, motions, of, 118, 218, stars, were, determined, with, an, unprecedented, degree, of, accuracy, a, new, tycho, catalog, drew, together, a, database, of, 1, 058, 332, stars, to, within, 20, 30, mas, milliarcseconds, additional, catalogues, were, compiled, for, the, 23, 882, double, and, multiple, stars, and, 11, 597, variable, stars, also, analyzed, during, the, hipparcos, mission, in, 2013, the, gaia, satellite, was, launched, and, improved, the, accuracy, of, hipparcos, the, precision, was, improved, by, a, factor, of, 100, and, enabled, the, mapping, of, a, billion, stars, today, the, catalogue, most, often, used, is, usno, b1, 0, an, all, sky, catalogue, that, tracks, proper, motions, positions, magnitudes, and, other, characteristics, for, over, one, billion, stellar, objects, during, the, past, 50, years, 7, 435, schmidt, camera, plates, were, used, to, complete, several, sky, surveys, that, make, the, data, in, usno, b1, 0, accurate, to, within, 0, 2, arcsec, apart, from, the, fundamental, function, of, providing, astronomers, with, a, reference, frame, to, report, their, observations, in, astrometry, is, also, fundamental, for, fields, like, celestial, mechanics, stellar, dynamics, and, galactic, astronomy, in, observational, astronomy, astrometric, techniques, help, identify, stellar, objects, by, their, unique, motions, it, is, instrumental, for, keeping, time, in, that, utc, is, essentially, the, atomic, time, synchronized, to, earth, s, rotation, by, means, of, exact, astronomical, observations, astrometry, is, an, important, step, in, the, cosmic, distance, ladder, because, it, establishes, parallax, distance, estimates, for, stars, in, the, milky, way, astrometry, has, also, been, used, to, support, claims, of, extrasolar, planet, detection, by, measuring, the, displacement, the, proposed, planets, cause, in, their, parent, star, s, apparent, position, on, the, sky, due, to, their, mutual, orbit, around, the, center, of, mass, of, the, system, astrometry, is, more, accurate, in, space, missions, that, are, not, affected, by, the, distorting, effects, of, the, earth, s, atmosphere, nasa, s, planned, space, interferometry, mission, sim, planetquest, now, cancelled, was, to, utilize, astrometric, techniques, to, detect, terrestrial, planets, orbiting, 200, or, so, of, the, nearest, solar, type, stars, the, european, space, agency, s, gaia, mission, launched, in, 2013, applies, astrometric, techniques, in, its, stellar, census, in, addition, to, the, detection, of, exoplanets, it, can, also, be, used, to, determine, their, mass, astrometric, measurements, are, used, by, astrophysicists, to, constrain, certain, models, in, celestial, mechanics, by, measuring, the, velocities, of, pulsars, it, is, possible, to, put, a, limit, on, the, asymmetry, of, supernova, explosions, also, astrometric, results, are, used, to, determine, the, distribution, of, dark, matter, in, the, galaxy, astronomers, use, astrometric, techniques, for, the, tracking, of, near, earth, objects, astrometry, is, responsible, for, the, detection, of, many, record, breaking, solar, system, objects, to, find, such, objects, astrometrically, astronomers, use, telescopes, to, survey, the, sky, and, large, area, cameras, to, take, pictures, at, various, determined, intervals, by, studying, these, images, they, can, detect, solar, system, objects, by, their, movements, relative, to, the, background, stars, which, remain, fixed, once, a, movement, per, unit, time, is, observed, astronomers, compensate, for, the, parallax, caused, by, earth, s, motion, during, this, time, and, the, heliocentric, distance, to, this, object, is, calculated, using, this, distance, and, other, photographs, more, information, about, the, object, including, its, orbital, elements, can, be, obtained, asteroid, impact, avoidance, is, among, the, purposes, quaoar, and, sedna, are, two, trans, neptunian, dwarf, planets, discovered, in, this, way, by, michael, e, brown, and, others, at, caltech, using, the, palomar, observatory, s, samuel, oschin, telescope, of, 48, inches, 1, 2, m, and, the, palomar, quest, large, area, ccd, camera, the, ability, of, astronomers, to, track, the, positions, and, movements, of, such, celestial, bodies, is, crucial, to, the, understanding, of, the, solar, system, and, its, interrelated, past, present, and, future, with, others, in, the, universe, a, fundamental, aspect, of, astrometry, is, error, correction, various, factors, introduce, errors, into, the, measurement, of, stellar, positions, including, atmospheric, conditions, imperfections, in, the, instruments, and, errors, by, the, observer, or, the, measuring, instruments, many, of, these, errors, can, be, reduced, by, various, techniques, such, as, through, instrument, improvements, and, compensations, to, the, data, the, results, are, then, analyzed, using, statistical, methods, to, compute, data, estimates, and, error, ranges
