a, chemical, bond, is, the, association, of, atoms, or, ions, to, form, molecules, crystals, and, other, structures, the, bond, may, result, from, the, electrostatic, force, between, oppositely, charged, ions, as, in, ionic, bonds, or, through, the, sharing, of, electrons, as, in, covalent, bonds, or, some, combination, of, these, effects, chemical, bonds, are, described, as, having, different, strengths, there, are, strong, bonds, or, primary, bonds, such, as, covalent, ionic, and, metallic, bonds, and, weak, bonds, or, secondary, bonds, such, as, dipole, dipole, interactions, the, london, dispersion, force, and, hydrogen, bonding, since, opposite, electric, charges, attract, the, negatively, charged, electrons, surrounding, the, nucleus, and, the, positively, charged, protons, within, a, nucleus, attract, each, other, electrons, shared, between, two, nuclei, will, be, attracted, to, both, of, them, constructive, quantum, mechanical, wavefunction, interference, stabilizes, the, paired, nuclei, see, theories, of, chemical, bonding, bonded, nuclei, maintain, an, optimal, distance, the, bond, distance, balancing, attractive, and, repulsive, effects, explained, quantitatively, by, quantum, theory, the, atoms, in, molecules, crystals, metals, and, other, forms, of, matter, are, held, together, by, chemical, bonds, which, determine, the, structure, and, properties, of, matter, all, bonds, can, be, described, by, quantum, theory, but, in, practice, simplified, rules, and, other, theories, allow, chemists, to, predict, the, strength, directionality, and, polarity, of, bonds, the, octet, rule, and, vsepr, theory, are, examples, more, sophisticated, theories, are, valence, bond, theory, which, includes, orbital, hybridization, and, resonance, and, molecular, orbital, theory, which, includes, the, linear, combination, of, atomic, orbitals, and, ligand, field, theory, electrostatics, are, used, to, describe, bond, polarities, and, the, effects, they, have, on, chemical, substances, a, chemical, bond, is, an, attraction, between, atoms, this, attraction, may, be, seen, as, the, result, of, different, behaviors, of, the, outermost, or, valence, electrons, of, atoms, these, behaviors, merge, into, each, other, seamlessly, in, various, circumstances, so, that, there, is, no, clear, line, to, be, drawn, between, them, however, it, remains, useful, and, customary, to, differentiate, between, different, types, of, bond, which, result, in, different, properties, of, condensed, matter, in, the, simplest, view, of, a, covalent, bond, one, or, more, electrons, often, a, pair, of, electrons, are, drawn, into, the, space, between, the, two, atomic, nuclei, energy, is, released, by, bond, formation, this, is, not, as, a, result, of, reduction, in, potential, energy, because, the, attraction, of, the, two, electrons, to, the, two, protons, is, offset, by, the, electron, electron, and, proton, proton, repulsions, instead, the, release, of, energy, and, hence, stability, of, the, bond, arises, from, the, reduction, in, kinetic, energy, due, to, the, electrons, being, in, a, more, spatially, distributed, i, e, longer, de, broglie, wavelength, orbital, compared, with, each, electron, being, confined, closer, to, its, respective, nucleus, these, bonds, exist, between, two, particular, identifiable, atoms, and, have, a, direction, in, space, allowing, them, to, be, shown, as, single, connecting, lines, between, atoms, in, drawings, or, modeled, as, sticks, between, spheres, in, models, in, a, polar, covalent, bond, one, or, more, electrons, are, unequally, shared, between, two, nuclei, covalent, bonds, often, result, in, the, formation, of, small, collections, of, better, connected, atoms, called, molecules, which, in, solids, and, liquids, are, bound, to, other, molecules, by, forces, that, are, often, much, weaker, than, the, covalent, bonds, that, hold, the, molecules, internally, together, such, weak, intermolecular, bonds, give, organic, molecular, substances, such, as, waxes, and, oils, their, soft, bulk, character, and, their, low, melting, points, in, liquids, molecules, must, cease, most, structured, or, oriented, contact, with, each, other, when, covalent, bonds, link, long, chains, of, atoms, in, large, molecules, however, as, in, polymers, such, as, nylon, or, when, covalent, bonds, extend, in, networks, through, solids, that, are, not, composed, of, discrete, molecules, such, as, diamond, or, quartz, or, the, silicate, minerals, in, many, types, of, rock, then, the, structures, that, result, may, be, both, strong, and, tough, at, least, in, the, direction, oriented, correctly, with, networks, of, covalent, bonds, also, the, melting, points, of, such, covalent, polymers, and, networks, increase, greatly, in, a, simplified, view, of, an, ionic, bond, the, bonding, electron, is, not, shared, at, all, but, transferred, in, this, type, of, bond, the, outer, atomic, orbital, of, one, atom, has, a, vacancy, which, allows, the, addition, of, one, or, more, electrons, these, newly, added, electrons, potentially, occupy, a, lower, energy, state, effectively, closer, to, more, nuclear, charge, than, they, experience, in, a, different, atom, thus, one, nucleus, offers, a, more, tightly, bound, position, to, an, electron, than, does, another, nucleus, with, the, result, that, one, atom, may, transfer, an, electron, to, the, other, this, transfer, causes, one, atom, to, assume, a, net, positive, charge, and, the, other, to, assume, a, net, negative, charge, the, bond, then, results, from, electrostatic, attraction, between, the, positive, and, negatively, charged, ions, ionic, bonds, may, be, seen, as, extreme, examples, of, polarization, in, covalent, bonds, often, such, bonds, have, no, particular, orientation, in, space, since, they, result, from, equal, electrostatic, attraction, of, each, ion, to, all, ions, around, them, ionic, bonds, are, strong, and, thus, ionic, substances, require, high, temperatures, to, melt, but, also, brittle, since, the, forces, between, ions, are, short, range, and, do, not, easily, bridge, cracks, and, fractures, this, type, of, bond, gives, rise, to, the, physical, characteristics, of, crystals, of, classic, mineral, salts, such, as, table, salt, a, less, often, mentioned, type, of, bonding, is, metallic, bonding, in, this, type, of, bonding, each, atom, in, a, metal, donates, one, or, more, electrons, to, a, sea, of, electrons, that, reside, between, many, metal, atoms, in, this, sea, each, electron, is, free, by, virtue, of, its, wave, nature, to, be, associated, with, a, great, many, atoms, at, once, the, bond, results, because, the, metal, atoms, become, somewhat, positively, charged, due, to, loss, of, their, electrons, while, the, electrons, remain, attracted, to, many, atoms, without, being, part, of, any, given, atom, metallic, bonding, may, be, seen, as, an, extreme, example, of, delocalization, of, electrons, over, a, large, system, of, covalent, bonds, in, which, every, atom, participates, this, type, of, bonding, is, often, very, strong, resulting, in, the, tensile, strength, of, metals, however, metallic, bonding, is, more, collective, in, nature, than, other, types, and, so, they, allow, metal, crystals, to, more, easily, deform, because, they, are, composed, of, atoms, attracted, to, each, other, but, not, in, any, particularly, oriented, ways, this, results, in, the, malleability, of, metals, the, cloud, of, electrons, in, metallic, bonding, causes, the, characteristically, good, electrical, and, thermal, conductivity, of, metals, and, also, their, shiny, lustre, that, reflects, most, frequencies, of, white, light, early, speculations, about, the, nature, of, the, chemical, bond, from, as, early, as, the, 12th, century, supposed, that, certain, types, of, chemical, species, were, joined, by, a, type, of, chemical, affinity, in, 1704, sir, isaac, newton, famously, outlined, his, atomic, bonding, theory, in, query, 31, of, his, opticks, whereby, atoms, attach, to, each, other, by, some, force, specifically, after, acknowledging, the, various, popular, theories, in, vogue, at, the, time, of, how, atoms, were, reasoned, to, attach, to, each, other, i, e, hooked, atoms, glued, together, by, rest, or, stuck, together, by, conspiring, motions, newton, states, that, he, would, rather, infer, from, their, cohesion, that, particles, attract, one, another, by, some, force, which, in, immediate, contact, is, exceedingly, strong, at, small, distances, performs, the, chemical, operations, and, reaches, not, far, from, the, particles, with, any, sensible, effect, in, 1819, on, the, heels, of, the, invention, of, the, voltaic, pile, j, ns, jakob, berzelius, developed, a, theory, of, chemical, combination, stressing, the, electronegative, and, electropositive, characters, of, the, combining, atoms, by, the, mid, 19th, century, edward, frankland, f, a, kekul, a, s, couper, alexander, butlerov, and, hermann, kolbe, building, on, the, theory, of, radicals, developed, the, theory, of, valency, originally, called, combining, power, in, which, compounds, were, joined, owing, to, an, attraction, of, positive, and, negative, poles, in, 1904, richard, abegg, proposed, his, rule, that, the, difference, between, the, maximum, and, minimum, valencies, of, an, element, is, often, eight, at, this, point, valency, was, still, an, empirical, number, based, only, on, chemical, properties, however, the, nature, of, the, atom, became, clearer, with, ernest, rutherford, s, 1911, discovery, that, of, an, atomic, nucleus, surrounded, by, electrons, in, which, he, quoted, nagaoka, rejected, thomson, s, model, on, the, grounds, that, opposite, charges, are, impenetrable, in, 1904, nagaoka, proposed, an, alternative, planetary, model, of, the, atom, in, which, a, positively, charged, center, is, surrounded, by, a, number, of, revolving, electrons, in, the, manner, of, saturn, and, its, rings, nagaoka, s, model, made, two, predictions, rutherford, mentions, nagaoka, s, model, in, his, 1911, paper, in, which, the, atomic, nucleus, is, proposed, at, the, 1911, solvay, conference, in, the, discussion, of, what, could, regulate, energy, differences, between, atoms, max, planck, stated, the, intermediaries, could, be, the, electrons, these, nuclear, models, suggested, that, electrons, determine, chemical, behavior, next, came, niels, bohr, s, 1913, model, of, a, nuclear, atom, with, electron, orbits, in, 1916, chemist, gilbert, n, lewis, developed, the, concept, of, electron, pair, bonds, in, which, two, atoms, may, share, one, to, six, electrons, thus, forming, the, single, electron, bond, a, single, bond, a, double, bond, or, a, triple, bond, in, lewis, s, own, words, an, electron, may, form, a, part, of, the, shell, of, two, different, atoms, and, cannot, be, said, to, belong, to, either, one, exclusively, also, in, 1916, walther, kossel, put, forward, a, theory, similar, to, lewis, only, his, model, assumed, complete, transfers, of, electrons, between, atoms, and, was, thus, a, model, of, ionic, bonding, both, lewis, and, kossel, structured, their, bonding, models, on, that, of, abegg, s, rule, 1904, niels, bohr, also, proposed, a, model, of, the, chemical, bond, in, 1913, according, to, his, model, for, a, diatomic, molecule, the, electrons, of, the, atoms, of, the, molecule, form, a, rotating, ring, whose, plane, is, perpendicular, to, the, axis, of, the, molecule, and, equidistant, from, the, atomic, nuclei, the, dynamic, equilibrium, of, the, molecular, system, is, achieved, through, the, balance, of, forces, between, the, forces, of, attraction, of, nuclei, to, the, plane, of, the, ring, of, electrons, and, the, forces, of, mutual, repulsion, of, the, nuclei, the, bohr, model, of, the, chemical, bond, took, into, account, the, coulomb, repulsion, the, electrons, in, the, ring, are, at, the, maximum, distance, from, each, other, in, 1927, the, first, mathematically, complete, quantum, description, of, a, simple, chemical, bond, i, e, that, produced, by, one, electron, in, the, hydrogen, molecular, ion, h, 2, was, derived, by, the, danish, physicist, yvind, burrau, this, work, showed, that, the, quantum, approach, to, chemical, bonds, could, be, fundamentally, and, quantitatively, correct, but, the, mathematical, methods, used, could, not, be, extended, to, molecules, containing, more, than, one, electron, a, more, practical, albeit, less, quantitative, approach, was, put, forward, in, the, same, year, by, walter, heitler, and, fritz, london, the, heitler, london, method, forms, the, basis, of, what, is, now, called, valence, bond, theory, in, 1929, the, linear, combination, of, atomic, orbitals, molecular, orbital, method, lcao, approximation, was, introduced, by, sir, john, lennard, jones, who, also, suggested, methods, to, derive, electronic, structures, of, molecules, of, f, 2, fluorine, and, o, 2, oxygen, molecules, from, basic, quantum, principles, this, molecular, orbital, theory, represented, a, covalent, bond, as, an, orbital, formed, by, combining, the, quantum, mechanical, schr, dinger, atomic, orbitals, which, had, been, hypothesized, for, electrons, in, single, atoms, the, equations, for, bonding, electrons, in, multi, electron, atoms, could, not, be, solved, to, mathematical, perfection, i, e, analytically, but, approximations, for, them, still, gave, many, good, qualitative, predictions, and, results, most, quantitative, calculations, in, modern, quantum, chemistry, use, either, valence, bond, or, molecular, orbital, theory, as, a, starting, point, although, a, third, approach, density, functional, theory, has, become, increasingly, popular, in, recent, years, in, 1933, h, h, james, and, a, s, coolidge, carried, out, a, calculation, on, the, dihydrogen, molecule, that, unlike, all, previous, calculation, which, used, functions, only, of, the, distance, of, the, electron, from, the, atomic, nucleus, used, functions, which, also, explicitly, added, the, distance, between, the, two, electrons, with, up, to, 13, adjustable, parameters, they, obtained, a, result, very, close, to, the, experimental, result, for, the, dissociation, energy, later, extensions, have, used, up, to, 54, parameters, and, gave, excellent, agreement, with, experiments, this, calculation, convinced, the, scientific, community, that, quantum, theory, could, give, agreement, with, experiment, however, this, approach, has, none, of, the, physical, pictures, of, the, valence, bond, and, molecular, orbital, theories, and, is, difficult, to, extend, to, larger, molecules, because, atoms, and, molecules, are, three, dimensional, it, is, difficult, to, use, a, single, method, to, indicate, orbitals, and, bonds, in, molecular, formulas, the, chemical, bonds, binding, orbitals, between, atoms, are, indicated, in, different, ways, depending, on, the, type, of, discussion, sometimes, some, details, are, neglected, for, example, in, organic, chemistry, one, is, sometimes, concerned, only, with, the, functional, group, of, the, molecule, thus, the, molecular, formula, of, ethanol, may, be, written, in, conformational, form, three, dimensional, form, full, two, dimensional, form, indicating, every, bond, with, no, three, dimensional, directions, compressed, two, dimensional, form, ch, 3, ch, 2, oh, by, separating, the, functional, group, from, another, part, of, the, molecule, c, 2, h, 5, oh, or, by, its, atomic, constituents, c, 2, h, 6, o, according, to, what, is, discussed, sometimes, even, the, non, bonding, valence, shell, electrons, with, the, two, dimensional, approximate, directions, are, marked, e, g, for, elemental, carbon, c, some, chemists, may, also, mark, the, respective, orbitals, e, g, the, hypothetical, ethene, 4, anion, c, c, 4, indicating, the, possibility, of, bond, formation, strong, chemical, bonds, are, the, intramolecular, forces, that, hold, atoms, together, in, molecules, a, strong, chemical, bond, is, formed, from, the, transfer, or, sharing, of, electrons, between, atomic, centers, and, relies, on, the, electrostatic, attraction, between, the, protons, in, nuclei, and, the, electrons, in, the, orbitals, the, types, of, strong, bond, differ, due, to, the, difference, in, electronegativity, of, the, constituent, elements, electronegativity, is, the, tendency, for, an, atom, of, a, given, chemical, element, to, attract, shared, electrons, when, forming, a, chemical, bond, where, the, higher, the, associated, electronegativity, then, the, more, it, attracts, electrons, electronegativity, serves, as, a, simple, way, to, quantitatively, estimate, the, bond, energy, which, characterizes, a, bond, along, the, continuous, scale, from, covalent, to, ionic, bonding, a, large, difference, in, electronegativity, leads, to, more, polar, ionic, character, in, the, bond, ionic, bonding, is, a, type, of, electrostatic, interaction, between, atoms, that, have, a, large, electronegativity, difference, there, is, no, precise, value, that, distinguishes, ionic, from, covalent, bonding, but, an, electronegativity, difference, of, over, 1, 7, is, likely, to, be, ionic, while, a, difference, of, less, than, 1, 7, is, likely, to, be, covalent, ionic, bonding, leads, to, separate, positive, and, negative, ions, ionic, charges, are, commonly, between, 3, e, to, 3, e, ionic, bonding, commonly, occurs, in, metal, salts, such, as, sodium, chloride, table, salt, a, typical, feature, of, ionic, bonds, is, that, the, species, form, into, ionic, crystals, in, which, no, ion, is, specifically, paired, with, any, single, other, ion, in, a, specific, directional, bond, rather, each, species, of, ion, is, surrounded, by, ions, of, the, opposite, charge, and, the, spacing, between, it, and, each, of, the, oppositely, charged, ions, near, it, is, the, same, for, all, surrounding, atoms, of, the, same, type, it, is, thus, no, longer, possible, to, associate, an, ion, with, any, specific, other, single, ionized, atom, near, it, this, is, a, situation, unlike, that, in, covalent, crystals, where, covalent, bonds, between, specific, atoms, are, still, discernible, from, the, shorter, distances, between, them, as, measured, via, such, techniques, as, x, ray, diffraction, ionic, crystals, may, contain, a, mixture, of, covalent, and, ionic, species, as, for, example, salts, of, complex, acids, such, as, sodium, cyanide, nacn, x, ray, diffraction, shows, that, in, nacn, for, example, the, bonds, between, sodium, cations, na, and, the, cyanide, anions, cn, are, ionic, with, no, sodium, ion, associated, with, any, particular, cyanide, however, the, bonds, between, the, carbon, c, and, nitrogen, n, atoms, in, cyanide, are, of, the, covalent, type, so, that, each, carbon, is, strongly, bound, to, just, one, nitrogen, to, which, it, is, physically, much, closer, than, it, is, to, other, carbons, or, nitrogens, in, a, sodium, cyanide, crystal, when, such, crystals, are, melted, into, liquids, the, ionic, bonds, are, broken, first, because, they, are, non, directional, and, allow, the, charged, species, to, move, freely, similarly, when, such, salts, dissolve, into, water, the, ionic, bonds, are, typically, broken, by, the, interaction, with, water, but, the, covalent, bonds, continue, to, hold, for, example, in, solution, the, cyanide, ions, still, bound, together, as, single, cn, ions, move, independently, through, the, solution, as, do, sodium, ions, as, na, in, water, charged, ions, move, apart, because, each, of, them, are, more, strongly, attracted, to, a, number, of, water, molecules, than, to, each, other, the, attraction, between, ions, and, water, molecules, in, such, solutions, is, due, to, a, type, of, weak, dipole, dipole, type, chemical, bond, in, melted, ionic, compounds, the, ions, continue, to, be, attracted, to, each, other, but, not, in, any, ordered, or, crystalline, way, covalent, bonding, is, a, common, type, of, bonding, in, which, two, or, more, atoms, share, valence, electrons, more, or, less, equally, the, simplest, and, most, common, type, is, a, single, bond, in, which, two, atoms, share, two, electrons, other, types, include, the, double, bond, the, triple, bond, one, and, three, electron, bonds, the, three, center, two, electron, bond, and, three, center, four, electron, bond, in, non, polar, covalent, bonds, the, electronegativity, difference, between, the, bonded, atoms, is, small, typically, 0, to, 0, 3, bonds, within, most, organic, compounds, are, described, as, covalent, the, figure, shows, methane, ch, 4, in, which, each, hydrogen, forms, a, covalent, bond, with, the, carbon, see, sigma, bonds, and, pi, bonds, for, lcao, descriptions, of, such, bonding, molecules, that, are, formed, primarily, from, non, polar, covalent, bonds, are, often, immiscible, in, water, or, other, polar, solvents, but, much, more, soluble, in, non, polar, solvents, such, as, hexane, a, polar, covalent, bond, is, a, covalent, bond, with, a, significant, ionic, character, this, means, that, the, two, shared, electrons, are, closer, to, one, of, the, atoms, than, the, other, creating, an, imbalance, of, charge, such, bonds, occur, between, two, atoms, with, moderately, different, electronegativities, and, give, rise, to, dipole, dipole, interactions, the, electronegativity, difference, between, the, two, atoms, in, these, bonds, is, 0, 3, to, 1, 7, a, single, bond, between, two, atoms, corresponds, to, the, sharing, of, one, pair, of, electrons, the, hydrogen, h, atom, has, one, valence, electron, two, hydrogen, atoms, can, then, form, a, molecule, held, together, by, the, shared, pair, of, electrons, each, h, atom, now, has, the, noble, gas, electron, configuration, of, helium, he, the, pair, of, shared, electrons, forms, a, single, covalent, bond, the, electron, density, of, these, two, bonding, electrons, in, the, region, between, the, two, atoms, increases, from, the, density, of, two, non, interacting, h, atoms, a, double, bond, has, two, shared, pairs, of, electrons, one, in, a, sigma, bond, and, one, in, a, pi, bond, with, electron, density, concentrated, on, two, opposite, sides, of, the, internuclear, axis, a, triple, bond, consists, of, three, shared, electron, pairs, forming, one, sigma, and, two, pi, bonds, an, example, is, nitrogen, quadruple, and, higher, bonds, are, very, rare, and, occur, only, between, certain, transition, metal, atoms, a, coordinate, covalent, bond, is, a, covalent, bond, in, which, the, two, shared, bonding, electrons, are, from, the, same, one, of, the, atoms, involved, in, the, bond, for, example, boron, trifluoride, bf, 3, and, ammonia, nh, 3, form, an, adduct, or, coordination, complex, f, 3, b, nh, 3, with, a, b, n, bond, in, which, a, lone, pair, of, electrons, on, n, is, shared, with, an, empty, atomic, orbital, on, b, bf, 3, with, an, empty, orbital, is, described, as, an, electron, pair, acceptor, or, lewis, acid, while, nh, 3, with, a, lone, pair, that, can, be, shared, is, described, as, an, electron, pair, donor, or, lewis, base, the, electrons, are, shared, roughly, equally, between, the, atoms, in, contrast, to, ionic, bonding, such, bonding, is, shown, by, an, arrow, pointing, to, the, lewis, acid, in, the, figure, solid, lines, are, bonds, in, the, plane, of, the, diagram, wedged, bonds, point, towards, the, observer, and, dashed, bonds, point, away, from, the, observer, transition, metal, complexes, are, generally, bound, by, coordinate, covalent, bonds, for, example, the, ion, ag, reacts, as, a, lewis, acid, with, two, molecules, of, the, lewis, base, nh, 3, to, form, the, complex, ion, ag, nh, 3, 2, which, has, two, ag, n, coordinate, covalent, bonds, in, metallic, bonding, bonding, electrons, are, delocalized, over, a, lattice, of, atoms, by, contrast, in, ionic, compounds, the, locations, of, the, binding, electrons, and, their, charges, are, static, the, free, movement, or, delocalization, of, bonding, electrons, leads, to, classical, metallic, properties, such, as, luster, surface, light, reflectivity, electrical, and, thermal, conductivity, ductility, and, high, tensile, strength, there, are, several, types, of, weak, bonds, that, can, be, formed, between, two, or, more, molecules, which, are, not, covalently, bound, intermolecular, forces, cause, molecules, to, attract, or, repel, each, other, often, these, forces, influence, physical, characteristics, such, as, the, melting, point, of, a, substance, van, der, waals, forces, are, interactions, between, closed, shell, molecules, they, include, both, coulombic, interactions, between, partial, charges, in, polar, molecules, and, pauli, repulsions, between, closed, electrons, shells, 696, keesom, forces, are, the, forces, between, the, permanent, dipoles, of, two, polar, molecules, 701, london, dispersion, forces, are, the, forces, between, induced, dipoles, of, different, molecules, 703, there, can, also, be, an, interaction, between, a, permanent, dipole, in, one, molecule, and, an, induced, dipole, in, another, molecule, 702, hydrogen, bonds, of, the, form, a, h, b, occur, when, a, and, b, are, two, highly, electronegative, atoms, usually, n, o, or, f, such, that, a, forms, a, highly, polar, covalent, bond, with, h, so, that, h, has, a, partial, positive, charge, and, b, has, a, lone, pair, of, electrons, which, is, attracted, to, this, partial, positive, charge, and, forms, a, hydrogen, bond, 702, hydrogen, bonds, are, responsible, for, the, high, boiling, points, of, water, and, ammonia, with, respect, to, their, heavier, analogues, in, some, cases, a, similar, halogen, bond, can, be, formed, by, a, halogen, atom, located, between, two, electronegative, atoms, on, different, molecules, at, short, distances, repulsive, forces, between, atoms, also, become, important, 705, 6, in, the, unrealistic, limit, of, pure, ionic, bonding, electrons, are, perfectly, localized, on, one, of, the, two, atoms, in, the, bond, such, bonds, can, be, understood, by, classical, physics, the, force, between, the, atoms, depends, on, isotropic, continuum, electrostatic, potentials, the, magnitude, of, the, force, is, in, simple, proportion, to, the, product, of, the, two, ionic, charges, according, to, coulomb, s, law, covalent, bonds, are, better, understood, by, valence, bond, vb, theory, or, molecular, orbital, mo, theory, the, properties, of, the, atoms, involved, can, be, understood, using, concepts, such, as, oxidation, number, formal, charge, and, electronegativity, the, electron, density, within, a, bond, is, not, assigned, to, individual, atoms, but, is, instead, delocalized, between, atoms, in, valence, bond, theory, bonding, is, conceptualized, as, being, built, up, from, electron, pairs, that, are, localized, and, shared, by, two, atoms, via, the, overlap, of, atomic, orbitals, the, concepts, of, orbital, hybridization, and, resonance, augment, this, basic, notion, of, the, electron, pair, bond, in, molecular, orbital, theory, bonding, is, viewed, as, being, delocalized, and, apportioned, in, orbitals, that, extend, throughout, the, molecule, and, are, adapted, to, its, symmetry, properties, typically, by, considering, linear, combinations, of, atomic, orbitals, lcao, valence, bond, theory, is, more, chemically, intuitive, by, being, spatially, localized, allowing, attention, to, be, focused, on, the, parts, of, the, molecule, undergoing, chemical, change, in, contrast, molecular, orbitals, are, more, natural, from, a, quantum, mechanical, point, of, view, with, orbital, energies, being, physically, significant, and, directly, linked, to, experimental, ionization, energies, from, photoelectron, spectroscopy, consequently, valence, bond, theory, and, molecular, orbital, theory, are, often, viewed, as, competing, but, complementary, frameworks, that, offer, different, insights, into, chemical, systems, as, approaches, for, electronic, structure, theory, both, mo, and, vb, methods, can, give, approximations, to, any, desired, level, of, accuracy, at, least, in, principle, however, at, lower, levels, the, approximations, differ, and, one, approach, may, be, better, suited, for, computations, involving, a, particular, system, or, property, than, the, other, unlike, the, spherically, symmetrical, coulombic, forces, in, pure, ionic, bonds, covalent, bonds, are, generally, directed, and, anisotropic, these, are, often, classified, based, on, their, symmetry, with, respect, to, a, molecular, plane, as, sigma, bonds, and, pi, bonds, in, the, general, case, atoms, form, bonds, that, are, intermediate, between, ionic, and, covalent, depending, on, the, relative, electronegativity, of, the, atoms, involved, bonds, of, this, type, are, known, as, polar, covalent, bonds
