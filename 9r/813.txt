atoms, are, the, basic, particles, of, the, chemical, elements, an, atom, consists, of, a, nucleus, of, protons, and, generally, neutrons, surrounded, by, an, electromagnetically, bound, swarm, of, electrons, the, chemical, elements, are, distinguished, from, each, other, by, the, number, of, protons, that, are, in, their, atoms, for, example, any, atom, that, contains, 11, protons, is, sodium, and, any, atom, that, contains, 29, protons, is, copper, atoms, with, the, same, number, of, protons, but, a, different, number, of, neutrons, are, called, isotopes, of, the, same, element, atoms, are, extremely, small, typically, around, 100, picometers, across, a, human, hair, is, about, a, million, carbon, atoms, wide, atoms, are, smaller, than, the, shortest, wavelength, of, visible, light, which, means, humans, cannot, see, atoms, with, conventional, microscopes, they, are, so, small, that, accurately, predicting, their, behavior, using, classical, physics, is, not, possible, due, to, quantum, effects, more, than, 99, 94, of, an, atom, s, mass, is, in, the, nucleus, protons, have, a, positive, electric, charge, and, neutrons, have, no, charge, so, the, nucleus, is, positively, charged, the, electrons, are, negatively, charged, and, this, opposing, charge, is, what, binds, them, to, the, nucleus, if, the, numbers, of, protons, and, electrons, are, equal, as, they, normally, are, then, the, atom, is, electrically, neutral, as, a, whole, if, an, atom, has, more, electrons, than, protons, then, it, has, an, overall, negative, charge, and, is, called, a, negative, ion, or, anion, conversely, if, it, has, more, protons, than, electrons, it, has, a, positive, charge, and, is, called, a, positive, ion, or, cation, the, electrons, of, an, atom, are, attracted, to, the, protons, in, an, atomic, nucleus, by, the, electromagnetic, force, the, protons, and, neutrons, in, the, nucleus, are, attracted, to, each, other, by, the, nuclear, force, this, force, is, usually, stronger, than, the, electromagnetic, force, that, repels, the, positively, charged, protons, from, one, another, under, certain, circumstances, the, repelling, electromagnetic, force, becomes, stronger, than, the, nuclear, force, in, this, case, the, nucleus, splits, and, leaves, behind, different, elements, this, is, a, form, of, nuclear, decay, atoms, can, attach, to, one, or, more, other, atoms, by, chemical, bonds, to, form, chemical, compounds, such, as, molecules, or, crystals, the, ability, of, atoms, to, attach, and, detach, from, each, other, is, responsible, for, most, of, the, physical, changes, observed, in, nature, chemistry, is, the, science, that, studies, these, changes, the, basic, idea, that, matter, is, made, up, of, tiny, indivisible, particles, is, an, old, idea, that, appeared, in, many, ancient, cultures, the, word, atom, is, derived, from, the, ancient, greek, word, atomos, which, means, uncuttable, but, this, ancient, idea, was, based, in, philosophical, reasoning, rather, than, scientific, reasoning, modern, atomic, theory, is, not, based, on, these, old, concepts, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, scientist, john, dalton, 1766, 1844, found, evidence, that, matter, really, is, composed, of, discrete, units, and, so, applied, the, word, atom, to, those, units, in, the, early, 1800s, john, dalton, compiled, experimental, data, gathered, by, him, and, other, scientists, and, discovered, a, pattern, now, known, as, the, law, of, multiple, proportions, he, noticed, that, in, any, group, of, chemical, compounds, which, all, contain, two, particular, chemical, elements, the, amount, of, element, a, per, measure, of, element, b, will, differ, across, these, compounds, by, ratios, of, small, whole, numbers, this, pattern, suggested, that, each, element, combines, with, other, elements, in, multiples, of, a, basic, unit, of, weight, with, each, element, having, a, unit, of, unique, weight, dalton, decided, to, call, these, units, atoms, for, example, there, are, two, types, of, tin, oxide, one, is, a, grey, powder, that, is, 88, 1, tin, and, 11, 9, oxygen, and, the, other, is, a, white, powder, that, is, 78, 7, tin, and, 21, 3, oxygen, adjusting, these, figures, in, the, grey, powder, there, is, about, 13, 5, g, of, oxygen, for, every, 100, g, of, tin, and, in, the, white, powder, there, is, about, 27, g, of, oxygen, for, every, 100, g, of, tin, 13, 5, and, 27, form, a, ratio, of, 1, 2, dalton, concluded, that, in, the, grey, oxide, there, is, one, atom, of, oxygen, for, every, atom, of, tin, and, in, the, white, oxide, there, are, two, atoms, of, oxygen, for, every, atom, of, tin, sno, and, sno, 2, dalton, also, analyzed, iron, oxides, there, is, one, type, of, iron, oxide, that, is, a, black, powder, which, is, 78, 1, iron, and, 21, 9, oxygen, and, there, is, another, iron, oxide, that, is, a, red, powder, which, is, 70, 4, iron, and, 29, 6, oxygen, adjusting, these, figures, in, the, black, powder, there, is, about, 28, g, of, oxygen, for, every, 100, g, of, iron, and, in, the, red, powder, there, is, about, 42, g, of, oxygen, for, every, 100, g, of, iron, 28, and, 42, form, a, ratio, of, 2, 3, dalton, concluded, that, in, these, oxides, for, every, two, atoms, of, iron, there, are, two, or, three, atoms, of, oxygen, respectively, fe, 2, o, 2, and, fe, 2, o, 3, as, a, final, example, nitrous, oxide, is, 63, 3, nitrogen, and, 36, 7, oxygen, nitric, oxide, is, 44, 05, nitrogen, and, 55, 95, oxygen, and, nitrogen, dioxide, is, 29, 5, nitrogen, and, 70, 5, oxygen, adjusting, these, figures, in, nitrous, oxide, there, is, 80, g, of, oxygen, for, every, 140, g, of, nitrogen, in, nitric, oxide, there, is, about, 160, g, of, oxygen, for, every, 140, g, of, nitrogen, and, in, nitrogen, dioxide, there, is, 320, g, of, oxygen, for, every, 140, g, of, nitrogen, 80, 160, and, 320, form, a, ratio, of, 1, 2, 4, the, respective, formulas, for, these, oxides, are, n, 2, o, no, and, no, 2, in, 1897, j, j, thomson, discovered, that, cathode, rays, are, not, a, form, of, light, but, made, of, negatively, charged, particles, because, they, can, be, deflected, by, electric, and, magnetic, fields, he, measured, these, particles, to, be, at, least, a, thousand, times, lighter, than, hydrogen, the, lightest, atom, he, called, these, new, particles, corpuscles, but, they, were, later, renamed, electrons, since, these, are, the, particles, that, carry, electricity, thomson, also, showed, that, electrons, were, identical, to, particles, given, off, by, photoelectric, and, radioactive, materials, thomson, explained, that, an, electric, current, is, the, passing, of, electrons, from, one, atom, to, the, next, and, when, there, was, no, current, the, electrons, embedded, themselves, in, the, atoms, this, in, turn, meant, that, atoms, were, not, indivisible, as, scientists, thought, the, atom, was, composed, of, electrons, whose, negative, charge, was, balanced, out, by, some, source, of, positive, charge, to, create, an, electrically, neutral, atom, ions, thomson, explained, must, be, atoms, which, have, an, excess, or, shortage, of, electrons, the, electrons, in, the, atom, logically, had, to, be, balanced, out, by, a, commensurate, amount, of, positive, charge, but, thomson, had, no, idea, where, this, positive, charge, came, from, so, he, tentatively, proposed, that, this, positive, charge, was, everywhere, in, the, atom, the, atom, being, in, the, shape, of, a, sphere, following, from, this, he, imagined, the, balance, of, electrostatic, forces, would, distribute, the, electrons, throughout, the, sphere, in, a, more, or, less, even, manner, thomson, s, model, is, popularly, known, as, the, plum, pudding, model, though, neither, thomson, nor, his, colleagues, used, this, analogy, thomson, s, model, was, incomplete, it, was, unable, to, predict, any, other, properties, of, the, elements, such, as, emission, spectra, and, valencies, it, was, soon, rendered, obsolete, by, the, discovery, of, the, atomic, nucleus, between, 1908, and, 1913, ernest, rutherford, and, his, colleagues, hans, geiger, and, ernest, marsden, performed, a, series, of, experiments, in, which, they, bombarded, thin, foils, of, metal, with, a, beam, of, alpha, particles, they, did, this, to, measure, the, scattering, patterns, of, the, alpha, particles, they, spotted, a, small, number, of, alpha, particles, being, deflected, by, angles, greater, than, 90, this, shouldn, t, have, been, possible, according, to, the, thomson, model, of, the, atom, whose, charges, were, too, diffuse, to, produce, a, sufficiently, strong, electric, field, the, deflections, should, have, all, been, negligible, rutherford, proposed, that, the, positive, charge, of, the, atom, along, with, most, of, the, atom, s, mass, is, concentrated, in, a, tiny, nucleus, at, the, center, of, the, atom, only, such, an, intense, concentration, of, positive, charge, anchored, by, its, high, mass, and, separated, from, the, negative, charge, could, produce, an, electric, field, that, could, deflect, the, alpha, particles, so, strongly, a, problem, in, classical, mechanics, is, that, an, accelerating, charged, particle, radiates, electromagnetic, radiation, causing, the, particle, to, lose, kinetic, energy, circular, motion, counts, as, acceleration, which, means, that, an, electron, orbiting, a, central, charge, should, spiral, down, into, the, nucleus, as, it, loses, speed, in, 1913, the, physicist, niels, bohr, proposed, a, new, model, in, which, the, electrons, of, an, atom, were, assumed, to, orbit, the, nucleus, but, could, only, do, so, in, a, finite, set, of, orbits, and, could, jump, between, these, orbits, only, in, discrete, changes, of, energy, corresponding, to, absorption, or, radiation, of, a, photon, this, quantization, was, used, to, explain, why, the, electrons, orbits, are, stable, and, why, elements, absorb, and, emit, electromagnetic, radiation, in, discrete, spectra, bohr, s, model, could, only, predict, the, emission, spectra, of, hydrogen, not, atoms, with, more, than, one, electron, back, in, 1815, william, prout, observed, that, the, atomic, weights, of, many, elements, were, multiples, of, hydrogen, s, atomic, weight, which, is, true, for, all, of, them, if, one, takes, isotopes, into, account, in, 1898, j, j, thomson, found, that, the, positive, charge, of, a, hydrogen, ion, is, equal, to, the, negative, charge, of, an, electron, in, 1913, henry, moseley, discovered, that, the, frequencies, of, x, ray, emissions, from, an, excited, atom, were, a, mathematical, function, of, its, atomic, number, and, hydrogen, s, nuclear, charge, in, 1917, rutherford, bombarded, nitrogen, gas, with, alpha, particles, and, detected, hydrogen, ions, being, emitted, from, the, gas, and, concluded, that, they, were, produced, by, alpha, particles, hitting, and, splitting, the, nitrogen, atoms, these, observations, led, rutherford, to, conclude, that, the, hydrogen, nucleus, is, a, singular, particle, with, a, positive, charge, equal, to, the, electron, s, negative, charge, he, named, this, particle, proton, in, 1920, an, element, s, atomic, number, which, is, defined, as, the, element, s, position, on, the, periodic, table, is, also, the, number, of, protons, it, has, in, its, nucleus, the, atomic, weight, of, each, element, is, higher, than, its, proton, number, so, rutherford, hypothesized, that, the, surplus, weight, was, carried, by, unknown, particles, with, no, electric, charge, and, a, mass, equal, to, that, of, the, proton, in, 1928, walter, bothe, observed, that, beryllium, emitted, a, highly, penetrating, electrically, neutral, radiation, when, bombarded, with, alpha, particles, it, was, later, discovered, that, this, radiation, could, knock, hydrogen, atoms, out, of, paraffin, wax, initially, it, was, thought, to, be, high, energy, gamma, radiation, since, gamma, radiation, had, a, similar, effect, on, electrons, in, metals, but, james, chadwick, found, that, the, ionization, effect, was, too, strong, for, it, to, be, due, to, electromagnetic, radiation, so, long, as, energy, and, momentum, were, conserved, in, the, interaction, in, 1932, chadwick, exposed, various, elements, such, as, hydrogen, and, nitrogen, to, the, mysterious, beryllium, radiation, and, by, measuring, the, energies, of, the, recoiling, charged, particles, he, deduced, that, the, radiation, was, actually, composed, of, electrically, neutral, particles, which, could, not, be, massless, like, the, gamma, ray, but, instead, were, required, to, have, a, mass, similar, to, that, of, a, proton, chadwick, now, claimed, these, particles, as, rutherford, s, neutrons, in, 1925, werner, heisenberg, published, the, first, consistent, mathematical, formulation, of, quantum, mechanics, matrix, mechanics, one, year, earlier, louis, de, broglie, had, proposed, that, all, particles, behave, like, waves, to, some, extent, and, in, 1926, erwin, schroedinger, used, this, idea, to, develop, the, schroedinger, equation, which, describes, electrons, as, three, dimensional, waveforms, rather, than, points, in, space, a, consequence, of, using, waveforms, to, describe, particles, is, that, it, is, mathematically, impossible, to, obtain, precise, values, for, both, the, position, and, momentum, of, a, particle, at, a, given, point, in, time, this, became, known, as, the, uncertainty, principle, formulated, by, werner, heisenberg, in, 1927, in, this, concept, for, a, given, accuracy, in, measuring, a, position, one, could, only, obtain, a, range, of, probable, values, for, momentum, and, vice, versa, thus, the, planetary, model, of, the, atom, was, discarded, in, favor, of, one, that, described, atomic, orbital, zones, around, the, nucleus, where, a, given, electron, is, most, likely, to, be, found, this, model, was, able, to, explain, observations, of, atomic, behavior, that, previous, models, could, not, such, as, certain, structural, and, spectral, patterns, of, atoms, larger, than, hydrogen, though, the, word, atom, originally, denoted, a, particle, that, cannot, be, cut, into, smaller, particles, in, modern, scientific, usage, the, atom, is, composed, of, various, subatomic, particles, the, constituent, particles, of, an, atom, are, the, electron, the, proton, and, the, neutron, the, electron, is, the, least, massive, of, these, particles, by, four, orders, of, magnitude, at, 9, 11, 10, 31, kg, with, a, negative, electrical, charge, and, a, size, that, is, too, small, to, be, measured, using, available, techniques, it, was, the, lightest, particle, with, a, positive, rest, mass, measured, until, the, discovery, of, neutrino, mass, under, ordinary, conditions, electrons, are, bound, to, the, positively, charged, nucleus, by, the, attraction, created, from, opposite, electric, charges, if, an, atom, has, more, or, fewer, electrons, than, its, atomic, number, then, it, becomes, respectively, negatively, or, positively, charged, as, a, whole, a, charged, atom, is, called, an, ion, electrons, have, been, known, since, the, late, 19th, century, mostly, thanks, to, j, j, thomson, see, history, of, subatomic, physics, for, details, protons, have, a, positive, charge, and, a, mass, of, 1, 6726, 10, 27, kg, the, number, of, protons, in, an, atom, is, called, its, atomic, number, ernest, rutherford, 1919, observed, that, nitrogen, under, alpha, particle, bombardment, ejects, what, appeared, to, be, hydrogen, nuclei, by, 1920, he, had, accepted, that, the, hydrogen, nucleus, is, a, distinct, particle, within, the, atom, and, named, it, proton, neutrons, have, no, electrical, charge, and, have, a, mass, of, 1, 6749, 10, 27, kg, neutrons, are, the, heaviest, of, the, three, constituent, particles, but, their, mass, can, be, reduced, by, the, nuclear, binding, energy, neutrons, and, protons, collectively, known, as, nucleons, have, comparable, dimensions, on, the, order, of, 2, 5, 10, 15, m, although, the, surface, of, these, particles, is, not, sharply, defined, the, neutron, was, discovered, in, 1932, by, the, english, physicist, james, chadwick, in, the, standard, model, of, physics, electrons, are, truly, elementary, particles, with, no, internal, structure, whereas, protons, and, neutrons, are, composite, particles, composed, of, elementary, particles, called, quarks, there, are, two, types, of, quarks, in, atoms, each, having, a, fractional, electric, charge, protons, are, composed, of, two, up, quarks, each, with, charge, 2, 3, and, one, down, quark, with, a, charge, of, 1, 3, neutrons, consist, of, one, up, quark, and, two, down, quarks, this, distinction, accounts, for, the, difference, in, mass, and, charge, between, the, two, particles, the, quarks, are, held, together, by, the, strong, interaction, or, strong, force, which, is, mediated, by, gluons, the, protons, and, neutrons, in, turn, are, held, to, each, other, in, the, nucleus, by, the, nuclear, force, which, is, a, residuum, of, the, strong, force, that, has, somewhat, different, range, properties, see, the, article, on, the, nuclear, force, for, more, the, gluon, is, a, member, of, the, family, of, gauge, bosons, which, are, elementary, particles, that, mediate, physical, forces, all, the, bound, protons, and, neutrons, in, an, atom, make, up, a, tiny, atomic, nucleus, and, are, collectively, called, nucleons, the, radius, of, a, nucleus, is, approximately, equal, to, 1, 07, a, 3, displaystyle, 1, 07, sqrt, a, femtometres, where, a, displaystyle, a, is, the, total, number, of, nucleons, this, is, much, smaller, than, the, radius, of, the, atom, which, is, on, the, order, of, 10, 5, fm, the, nucleons, are, bound, together, by, a, short, ranged, attractive, potential, called, the, residual, strong, force, at, distances, smaller, than, 2, 5, fm, this, force, is, much, more, powerful, than, the, electrostatic, force, that, causes, positively, charged, protons, to, repel, each, other, atoms, of, the, same, element, have, the, same, number, of, protons, called, the, atomic, number, within, a, single, element, the, number, of, neutrons, may, vary, determining, the, isotope, of, that, element, the, total, number, of, protons, and, neutrons, determine, the, nuclide, the, number, of, neutrons, relative, to, the, protons, determines, the, stability, of, the, nucleus, with, certain, isotopes, undergoing, radioactive, decay, the, proton, the, electron, and, the, neutron, are, classified, as, fermions, fermions, obey, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, which, prohibits, identical, fermions, such, as, multiple, protons, from, occupying, the, same, quantum, state, at, the, same, time, thus, every, proton, in, the, nucleus, must, occupy, a, quantum, state, different, from, all, other, protons, and, the, same, applies, to, all, neutrons, of, the, nucleus, and, to, all, electrons, of, the, electron, cloud, a, nucleus, that, has, a, different, number, of, protons, than, neutrons, can, potentially, drop, to, a, lower, energy, state, through, a, radioactive, decay, that, causes, the, number, of, protons, and, neutrons, to, more, closely, match, as, a, result, atoms, with, matching, numbers, of, protons, and, neutrons, are, more, stable, against, decay, but, with, increasing, atomic, number, the, mutual, repulsion, of, the, protons, requires, an, increasing, proportion, of, neutrons, to, maintain, the, stability, of, the, nucleus, the, number, of, protons, and, neutrons, in, the, atomic, nucleus, can, be, modified, although, this, can, require, very, high, energies, because, of, the, strong, force, nuclear, fusion, occurs, when, multiple, atomic, particles, join, to, form, a, heavier, nucleus, such, as, through, the, energetic, collision, of, two, nuclei, for, example, at, the, core, of, the, sun, protons, require, energies, of, 3, to, 10, kev, to, overcome, their, mutual, repulsion, the, coulomb, barrier, and, fuse, together, into, a, single, nucleus, nuclear, fission, is, the, opposite, process, causing, a, nucleus, to, split, into, two, smaller, nuclei, usually, through, radioactive, decay, the, nucleus, can, also, be, modified, through, bombardment, by, high, energy, subatomic, particles, or, photons, if, this, modifies, the, number, of, protons, in, a, nucleus, the, atom, changes, to, a, different, chemical, element, if, the, mass, of, the, nucleus, following, a, fusion, reaction, is, less, than, the, sum, of, the, masses, of, the, separate, particles, then, the, difference, between, these, two, values, can, be, emitted, as, a, type, of, usable, energy, such, as, a, gamma, ray, or, the, kinetic, energy, of, a, beta, particle, as, described, by, albert, einstein, s, mass, energy, equivalence, formula, e, mc, 2, where, m, is, the, mass, loss, and, c, is, the, speed, of, light, this, deficit, is, part, of, the, binding, energy, of, the, new, nucleus, and, it, is, the, non, recoverable, loss, of, the, energy, that, causes, the, fused, particles, to, remain, together, in, a, state, that, requires, this, energy, to, separate, the, fusion, of, two, nuclei, that, create, larger, nuclei, with, lower, atomic, numbers, than, iron, and, nickel, a, total, nucleon, number, of, about, 60, is, usually, an, exothermic, process, that, releases, more, energy, than, is, required, to, bring, them, together, it, is, this, energy, releasing, process, that, makes, nuclear, fusion, in, stars, a, self, sustaining, reaction, for, heavier, nuclei, the, binding, energy, per, nucleon, begins, to, decrease, that, means, that, a, fusion, process, producing, a, nucleus, that, has, an, atomic, number, higher, than, about, 26, and, a, mass, number, higher, than, about, 60, is, an, endothermic, process, thus, more, massive, nuclei, cannot, undergo, an, energy, producing, fusion, reaction, that, can, sustain, the, hydrostatic, equilibrium, of, a, star, the, electrons, in, an, atom, are, attracted, to, the, protons, in, the, nucleus, by, the, electromagnetic, force, this, force, binds, the, electrons, inside, an, electrostatic, potential, well, surrounding, the, smaller, nucleus, which, means, that, an, external, source, of, energy, is, needed, for, the, electron, to, escape, the, closer, an, electron, is, to, the, nucleus, the, greater, the, attractive, force, hence, electrons, bound, near, the, center, of, the, potential, well, require, more, energy, to, escape, than, those, at, greater, separations, electrons, like, other, particles, have, properties, of, both, a, particle, and, a, wave, the, electron, cloud, is, a, region, inside, the, potential, well, where, each, electron, forms, a, type, of, three, dimensional, standing, wave, a, wave, form, that, does, not, move, relative, to, the, nucleus, this, behavior, is, defined, by, an, atomic, orbital, a, mathematical, function, that, characterises, the, probability, that, an, electron, appears, to, be, at, a, particular, location, when, its, position, is, measured, only, a, discrete, or, quantized, set, of, these, orbitals, exist, around, the, nucleus, as, other, possible, wave, patterns, rapidly, decay, into, a, more, stable, form, orbitals, can, have, one, or, more, ring, or, node, structures, and, differ, from, each, other, in, size, shape, and, orientation, each, atomic, orbital, corresponds, to, a, particular, energy, level, of, the, electron, the, electron, can, change, its, state, to, a, higher, energy, level, by, absorbing, a, photon, with, sufficient, energy, to, boost, it, into, the, new, quantum, state, likewise, through, spontaneous, emission, an, electron, in, a, higher, energy, state, can, drop, to, a, lower, energy, state, while, radiating, the, excess, energy, as, a, photon, these, characteristic, energy, values, defined, by, the, differences, in, the, energies, of, the, quantum, states, are, responsible, for, atomic, spectral, lines, the, amount, of, energy, needed, to, remove, or, add, an, electron, the, electron, binding, energy, is, far, less, than, the, binding, energy, of, nucleons, for, example, it, requires, only, 13, 6, ev, to, strip, a, ground, state, electron, from, a, hydrogen, atom, compared, to, 2, 23, million, ev, for, splitting, a, deuterium, nucleus, atoms, are, electrically, neutral, if, they, have, an, equal, number, of, protons, and, electrons, atoms, that, have, either, a, deficit, or, a, surplus, of, electrons, are, called, ions, electrons, that, are, farthest, from, the, nucleus, may, be, transferred, to, other, nearby, atoms, or, shared, between, atoms, by, this, mechanism, atoms, are, able, to, bond, into, molecules, and, other, types, of, chemical, compounds, like, ionic, and, covalent, network, crystals, by, definition, any, two, atoms, with, an, identical, number, of, protons, in, their, nuclei, belong, to, the, same, chemical, element, atoms, with, equal, numbers, of, protons, but, a, different, number, of, neutrons, are, different, isotopes, of, the, same, element, for, example, all, hydrogen, atoms, admit, exactly, one, proton, but, isotopes, exist, with, no, neutrons, hydrogen, 1, by, far, the, most, common, form, also, called, protium, one, neutron, deuterium, two, neutrons, tritium, and, more, than, two, neutrons, the, known, elements, form, a, set, of, atomic, numbers, from, the, single, proton, element, hydrogen, up, to, the, 118, proton, element, oganesson, all, known, isotopes, of, elements, with, atomic, numbers, greater, than, 82, are, radioactive, although, the, radioactivity, of, element, 83, bismuth, is, so, slight, as, to, be, practically, negligible, about, 339, nuclides, occur, naturally, on, earth, of, which, 251, about, 74, have, not, been, observed, to, decay, and, are, referred, to, as, stable, isotopes, only, 90, nuclides, are, stable, theoretically, while, another, 161, bringing, the, total, to, 251, have, not, been, observed, to, decay, even, though, in, theory, it, is, energetically, possible, these, are, also, formally, classified, as, stable, an, additional, 35, radioactive, nuclides, have, half, lives, longer, than, 100, million, years, and, are, long, lived, enough, to, have, been, present, since, the, birth, of, the, solar, system, this, collection, of, 286, nuclides, are, known, as, primordial, nuclides, finally, an, additional, 53, short, lived, nuclides, are, known, to, occur, naturally, as, daughter, products, of, primordial, nuclide, decay, such, as, radium, from, uranium, or, as, products, of, natural, energetic, processes, on, earth, such, as, cosmic, ray, bombardment, for, example, carbon, 14, for, 80, of, the, chemical, elements, at, least, one, stable, isotope, exists, as, a, rule, there, is, only, a, handful, of, stable, isotopes, for, each, of, these, elements, the, average, being, 3, 1, stable, isotopes, per, element, twenty, six, monoisotopic, elements, have, only, a, single, stable, isotope, while, the, largest, number, of, stable, isotopes, observed, for, any, element, is, ten, for, the, element, tin, elements, 43, 61, and, all, elements, numbered, 83, or, higher, have, no, stable, isotopes, 1, 12, stability, of, isotopes, is, affected, by, the, ratio, of, protons, to, neutrons, and, also, by, the, presence, of, certain, magic, numbers, of, neutrons, or, protons, that, represent, closed, and, filled, quantum, shells, these, quantum, shells, correspond, to, a, set, of, energy, levels, within, the, shell, model, of, the, nucleus, filled, shells, such, as, the, filled, shell, of, 50, protons, for, tin, confers, unusual, stability, on, the, nuclide, of, the, 251, known, stable, nuclides, only, four, have, both, an, odd, number, of, protons, and, odd, number, of, neutrons, hydrogen, 2, deuterium, lithium, 6, boron, 10, and, nitrogen, 14, tantalum, 180m, is, odd, odd, and, observationally, stable, but, is, predicted, to, decay, with, a, very, long, half, life, also, only, four, naturally, occurring, radioactive, odd, odd, nuclides, have, a, half, life, over, a, billion, years, potassium, 40, vanadium, 50, lanthanum, 138, and, lutetium, 176, most, odd, odd, nuclei, are, highly, unstable, with, respect, to, beta, decay, because, the, decay, products, are, even, even, and, are, therefore, more, strongly, bound, due, to, nuclear, pairing, effects, the, large, majority, of, an, atom, s, mass, comes, from, the, protons, and, neutrons, that, make, it, up, the, total, number, of, these, particles, called, nucleons, in, a, given, atom, is, called, the, mass, number, it, is, a, positive, integer, and, dimensionless, instead, of, having, dimension, of, mass, because, it, expresses, a, count, an, example, of, use, of, a, mass, number, is, carbon, 12, which, has, 12, nucleons, six, protons, and, six, neutrons, the, actual, mass, of, an, atom, at, rest, is, often, expressed, in, daltons, da, also, called, the, unified, atomic, mass, unit, u, this, unit, is, defined, as, a, twelfth, of, the, mass, of, a, free, neutral, atom, of, carbon, 12, which, is, approximately, 1, 66, 10, 27, kg, hydrogen, 1, the, lightest, isotope, of, hydrogen, which, is, also, the, nuclide, with, the, lowest, mass, has, an, atomic, weight, of, 1, 007825, da, the, value, of, this, number, is, called, the, atomic, mass, a, given, atom, has, an, atomic, mass, approximately, equal, within, 1, to, its, mass, number, times, the, atomic, mass, unit, for, example, the, mass, of, a, nitrogen, 14, is, roughly, 14, da, but, this, number, will, not, be, exactly, an, integer, except, by, definition, in, the, case, of, carbon, 12, the, heaviest, stable, atom, is, lead, 208, with, a, mass, of, 207, 976, 6521, da, as, even, the, most, massive, atoms, are, far, too, light, to, work, with, directly, chemists, instead, use, the, unit, of, moles, one, mole, of, atoms, of, any, element, always, has, the, same, number, of, atoms, about, 6, 022, 10, 23, this, number, was, chosen, so, that, if, an, element, has, an, atomic, mass, of, 1, u, a, mole, of, atoms, of, that, element, has, a, mass, close, to, one, gram, because, of, the, definition, of, the, unified, atomic, mass, unit, each, carbon, 12, atom, has, an, atomic, mass, of, exactly, 12, da, and, so, a, mole, of, carbon, 12, atoms, weighs, exactly, 0, 012, kg, atoms, lack, a, well, defined, outer, boundary, so, their, dimensions, are, usually, described, in, terms, of, an, atomic, radius, this, is, a, measure, of, the, distance, out, to, which, the, electron, cloud, extends, from, the, nucleus, this, assumes, the, atom, to, exhibit, a, spherical, shape, which, is, only, obeyed, for, atoms, in, vacuum, or, free, space, atomic, radii, may, be, derived, from, the, distances, between, two, nuclei, when, the, two, atoms, are, joined, in, a, chemical, bond, the, radius, varies, with, the, location, of, an, atom, on, the, atomic, chart, the, type, of, chemical, bond, the, number, of, neighboring, atoms, coordination, number, and, a, quantum, mechanical, property, known, as, spin, on, the, periodic, table, of, the, elements, atom, size, tends, to, increase, when, moving, down, columns, but, decrease, when, moving, across, rows, left, to, right, consequently, the, smallest, atom, is, helium, with, a, radius, of, 32, pm, while, one, of, the, largest, is, caesium, at, 225, pm, when, subjected, to, external, forces, like, electrical, fields, the, shape, of, an, atom, may, deviate, from, spherical, symmetry, the, deformation, depends, on, the, field, magnitude, and, the, orbital, type, of, outer, shell, electrons, as, shown, by, group, theoretical, considerations, aspherical, deviations, might, be, elicited, for, instance, in, crystals, where, large, crystal, electrical, fields, may, occur, at, low, symmetry, lattice, sites, significant, ellipsoidal, deformations, have, been, shown, to, occur, for, sulfur, ions, and, chalcogen, ions, in, pyrite, type, compounds, atomic, dimensions, are, thousands, of, times, smaller, than, the, wavelengths, of, light, 400, 700, nm, so, they, cannot, be, viewed, using, an, optical, microscope, although, individual, atoms, can, be, observed, using, a, scanning, tunneling, microscope, to, visualize, the, minuteness, of, the, atom, consider, that, a, typical, human, hair, is, about, 1, million, carbon, atoms, in, width, a, single, drop, of, water, contains, about, 2, sextillion, 2, 10, 21, atoms, of, oxygen, and, twice, the, number, of, hydrogen, atoms, a, single, carat, diamond, with, a, mass, of, 2, 10, 4, kg, contains, about, 10, sextillion, 10, 22, atoms, of, carbon, if, an, apple, were, magnified, to, the, size, of, the, earth, then, the, atoms, in, the, apple, would, be, approximately, the, size, of, the, original, apple, every, element, has, one, or, more, isotopes, that, have, unstable, nuclei, that, are, subject, to, radioactive, decay, causing, the, nucleus, to, emit, particles, or, electromagnetic, radiation, radioactivity, can, occur, when, the, radius, of, a, nucleus, is, large, compared, with, the, radius, of, the, strong, force, which, only, acts, over, distances, on, the, order, of, 1, fm, the, most, common, forms, of, radioactive, decay, are, other, more, rare, types, of, radioactive, decay, include, ejection, of, neutrons, or, protons, or, clusters, of, nucleons, from, a, nucleus, or, more, than, one, beta, particle, an, analog, of, gamma, emission, which, allows, excited, nuclei, to, lose, energy, in, a, different, way, is, internal, conversion, a, process, that, produces, high, speed, electrons, that, are, not, beta, rays, followed, by, production, of, high, energy, photons, that, are, not, gamma, rays, a, few, large, nuclei, explode, into, two, or, more, charged, fragments, of, varying, masses, plus, several, neutrons, in, a, decay, called, spontaneous, nuclear, fission, each, radioactive, isotope, has, a, characteristic, decay, time, period, the, half, life, that, is, determined, by, the, amount, of, time, needed, for, half, of, a, sample, to, decay, this, is, an, exponential, decay, process, that, steadily, decreases, the, proportion, of, the, remaining, isotope, by, 50, every, half, life, hence, after, two, half, lives, have, passed, only, 25, of, the, isotope, is, present, and, so, forth, elementary, particles, possess, an, intrinsic, quantum, mechanical, property, known, as, spin, this, is, analogous, to, the, angular, momentum, of, an, object, that, is, spinning, around, its, center, of, mass, although, strictly, speaking, these, particles, are, believed, to, be, point, like, and, cannot, be, said, to, be, rotating, spin, is, measured, in, units, of, the, reduced, planck, constant, with, electrons, protons, and, neutrons, all, having, spin, 1, 2, or, spin, 1, 2, in, an, atom, electrons, in, motion, around, the, nucleus, possess, orbital, angular, momentum, in, addition, to, their, spin, while, the, nucleus, itself, possesses, angular, momentum, due, to, its, nuclear, spin, the, magnetic, field, produced, by, an, atom, its, magnetic, moment, is, determined, by, these, various, forms, of, angular, momentum, just, as, a, rotating, charged, object, classically, produces, a, magnetic, field, but, the, most, dominant, contribution, comes, from, electron, spin, due, to, the, nature, of, electrons, to, obey, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, in, which, no, two, electrons, may, be, found, in, the, same, quantum, state, bound, electrons, pair, up, with, each, other, with, one, member, of, each, pair, in, a, spin, up, state, and, the, other, in, the, opposite, spin, down, state, thus, these, spins, cancel, each, other, out, reducing, the, total, magnetic, dipole, moment, to, zero, in, some, atoms, with, even, number, of, electrons, in, ferromagnetic, elements, such, as, iron, cobalt, and, nickel, an, odd, number, of, electrons, leads, to, an, unpaired, electron, and, a, net, overall, magnetic, moment, the, orbitals, of, neighboring, atoms, overlap, and, a, lower, energy, state, is, achieved, when, the, spins, of, unpaired, electrons, are, aligned, with, each, other, a, spontaneous, process, known, as, an, exchange, interaction, when, the, magnetic, moments, of, ferromagnetic, atoms, are, lined, up, the, material, can, produce, a, measurable, macroscopic, field, paramagnetic, materials, have, atoms, with, magnetic, moments, that, line, up, in, random, directions, when, no, magnetic, field, is, present, but, the, magnetic, moments, of, the, individual, atoms, line, up, in, the, presence, of, a, field, the, nucleus, of, an, atom, will, have, no, spin, when, it, has, even, numbers, of, both, neutrons, and, protons, but, for, other, cases, of, odd, numbers, the, nucleus, may, have, a, spin, normally, nuclei, with, spin, are, aligned, in, random, directions, because, of, thermal, equilibrium, but, for, certain, elements, such, as, xenon, 129, it, is, possible, to, polarize, a, significant, proportion, of, the, nuclear, spin, states, so, that, they, are, aligned, in, the, same, direction, a, condition, called, hyperpolarization, this, has, important, applications, in, magnetic, resonance, imaging, the, potential, energy, of, an, electron, in, an, atom, is, negative, relative, to, when, the, distance, from, the, nucleus, goes, to, infinity, its, dependence, on, the, electron, s, position, reaches, the, minimum, inside, the, nucleus, roughly, in, inverse, proportion, to, the, distance, in, the, quantum, mechanical, model, a, bound, electron, can, occupy, only, a, set, of, states, centered, on, the, nucleus, and, each, state, corresponds, to, a, specific, energy, level, see, time, independent, schr, dinger, equation, for, a, theoretical, explanation, an, energy, level, can, be, measured, by, the, amount, of, energy, needed, to, unbind, the, electron, from, the, atom, and, is, usually, given, in, units, of, electronvolts, ev, the, lowest, energy, state, of, a, bound, electron, is, called, the, ground, state, i, e, stationary, state, while, an, electron, transition, to, a, higher, level, results, in, an, excited, state, the, electron, s, energy, increases, along, with, n, because, the, average, distance, to, the, nucleus, increases, dependence, of, the, energy, on, is, caused, not, by, the, electrostatic, potential, of, the, nucleus, but, by, interaction, between, electrons, for, an, electron, to, transition, between, two, different, states, e, g, ground, state, to, first, excited, state, it, must, absorb, or, emit, a, photon, at, an, energy, matching, the, difference, in, the, potential, energy, of, those, levels, according, to, the, niels, bohr, model, what, can, be, precisely, calculated, by, the, schr, dinger, equation, electrons, jump, between, orbitals, in, a, particle, like, fashion, for, example, if, a, single, photon, strikes, the, electrons, only, a, single, electron, changes, states, in, response, to, the, photon, see, electron, properties, the, energy, of, an, emitted, photon, is, proportional, to, its, frequency, so, these, specific, energy, levels, appear, as, distinct, bands, in, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, each, element, has, a, characteristic, spectrum, that, can, depend, on, the, nuclear, charge, subshells, filled, by, electrons, the, electromagnetic, interactions, between, the, electrons, and, other, factors, when, a, continuous, spectrum, of, energy, is, passed, through, a, gas, or, plasma, some, of, the, photons, are, absorbed, by, atoms, causing, electrons, to, change, their, energy, level, those, excited, electrons, that, remain, bound, to, their, atom, spontaneously, emit, this, energy, as, a, photon, traveling, in, a, random, direction, and, so, drop, back, to, lower, energy, levels, thus, the, atoms, behave, like, a, filter, that, forms, a, series, of, dark, absorption, bands, in, the, energy, output, an, observer, viewing, the, atoms, from, a, view, that, does, not, include, the, continuous, spectrum, in, the, background, instead, sees, a, series, of, emission, lines, from, the, photons, emitted, by, the, atoms, spectroscopic, measurements, of, the, strength, and, width, of, atomic, spectral, lines, allow, the, composition, and, physical, properties, of, a, substance, to, be, determined, close, examination, of, the, spectral, lines, reveals, that, some, display, a, fine, structure, splitting, this, occurs, because, of, spin, orbit, coupling, which, is, an, interaction, between, the, spin, and, motion, of, the, outermost, electron, when, an, atom, is, in, an, external, magnetic, field, spectral, lines, become, split, into, three, or, more, components, a, phenomenon, called, the, zeeman, effect, this, is, caused, by, the, interaction, of, the, magnetic, field, with, the, magnetic, moment, of, the, atom, and, its, electrons, some, atoms, can, have, multiple, electron, configurations, with, the, same, energy, level, which, thus, appear, as, a, single, spectral, line, the, interaction, of, the, magnetic, field, with, the, atom, shifts, these, electron, configurations, to, slightly, different, energy, levels, resulting, in, multiple, spectral, lines, the, presence, of, an, external, electric, field, can, cause, a, comparable, splitting, and, shifting, of, spectral, lines, by, modifying, the, electron, energy, levels, a, phenomenon, called, the, stark, effect, if, a, bound, electron, is, in, an, excited, state, an, interacting, photon, with, the, proper, energy, can, cause, stimulated, emission, of, a, photon, with, a, matching, energy, level, for, this, to, occur, the, electron, must, drop, to, a, lower, energy, state, that, has, an, energy, difference, matching, the, energy, of, the, interacting, photon, the, emitted, photon, and, the, interacting, photon, then, move, off, in, parallel, and, with, matching, phases, that, is, the, wave, patterns, of, the, two, photons, are, synchronized, this, physical, property, is, used, to, make, lasers, which, can, emit, a, coherent, beam, of, light, energy, in, a, narrow, frequency, band, valency, is, the, combining, power, of, an, element, it, is, determined, by, the, number, of, bonds, it, can, form, to, other, atoms, or, groups, the, outermost, electron, shell, of, an, atom, in, its, uncombined, state, is, known, as, the, valence, shell, and, the, electrons, in, that, shell, are, called, valence, electrons, the, number, of, valence, electrons, determines, the, bonding, behavior, with, other, atoms, atoms, tend, to, chemically, react, with, each, other, in, a, manner, that, fills, or, empties, their, outer, valence, shells, for, example, a, transfer, of, a, single, electron, between, atoms, is, a, useful, approximation, for, bonds, that, form, between, atoms, with, one, electron, more, than, a, filled, shell, and, others, that, are, one, electron, short, of, a, full, shell, such, as, occurs, in, the, compound, sodium, chloride, and, other, chemical, ionic, salts, many, elements, display, multiple, valences, or, tendencies, to, share, differing, numbers, of, electrons, in, different, compounds, thus, chemical, bonding, between, these, elements, takes, many, forms, of, electron, sharing, that, are, more, than, simple, electron, transfers, examples, include, the, element, carbon, and, the, organic, compounds, the, chemical, elements, are, often, displayed, in, a, periodic, table, that, is, laid, out, to, display, recurring, chemical, properties, and, elements, with, the, same, number, of, valence, electrons, form, a, group, that, is, aligned, in, the, same, column, of, the, table, the, horizontal, rows, correspond, to, the, filling, of, a, quantum, shell, of, electrons, the, elements, at, the, far, right, of, the, table, have, their, outer, shell, completely, filled, with, electrons, which, results, in, chemically, inert, elements, known, as, the, noble, gases, quantities, of, atoms, are, found, in, different, states, of, matter, that, depend, on, the, physical, conditions, such, as, temperature, and, pressure, by, varying, the, conditions, materials, can, transition, between, solids, liquids, gases, and, plasmas, within, a, state, a, material, can, also, exist, in, different, allotropes, an, example, of, this, is, solid, carbon, which, can, exist, as, graphite, or, diamond, gaseous, allotropes, exist, as, well, such, as, dioxygen, and, ozone, at, temperatures, close, to, absolute, zero, atoms, can, form, a, bose, einstein, condensate, at, which, point, quantum, mechanical, effects, which, are, normally, only, observed, at, the, atomic, scale, become, apparent, on, a, macroscopic, scale, this, super, cooled, collection, of, atoms, then, behaves, as, a, single, super, atom, which, may, allow, fundamental, checks, of, quantum, mechanical, behavior, while, atoms, are, too, small, to, be, seen, devices, such, as, the, scanning, tunneling, microscope, stm, enable, their, visualization, at, the, surfaces, of, solids, the, microscope, uses, the, quantum, tunneling, phenomenon, which, allows, particles, to, pass, through, a, barrier, that, would, be, insurmountable, in, the, classical, perspective, electrons, tunnel, through, the, vacuum, between, two, biased, electrodes, providing, a, tunneling, current, that, is, exponentially, dependent, on, their, separation, one, electrode, is, a, sharp, tip, ideally, ending, with, a, single, atom, at, each, point, of, the, scan, of, the, surface, the, tip, s, height, is, adjusted, so, as, to, keep, the, tunneling, current, at, a, set, value, how, much, the, tip, moves, to, and, away, from, the, surface, is, interpreted, as, the, height, profile, for, low, bias, the, microscope, images, the, averaged, electron, orbitals, across, closely, packed, energy, levels, the, local, density, of, the, electronic, states, near, the, fermi, level, because, of, the, distances, involved, both, electrodes, need, to, be, extremely, stable, only, then, periodicities, can, be, observed, that, correspond, to, individual, atoms, the, method, alone, is, not, chemically, specific, and, cannot, identify, the, atomic, species, present, at, the, surface, atoms, can, be, easily, identified, by, their, mass, if, an, atom, is, ionized, by, removing, one, of, its, electrons, its, trajectory, when, it, passes, through, a, magnetic, field, will, bend, the, radius, by, which, the, trajectory, of, a, moving, ion, is, turned, by, the, magnetic, field, is, determined, by, the, mass, of, the, atom, the, mass, spectrometer, uses, this, principle, to, measure, the, mass, to, charge, ratio, of, ions, if, a, sample, contains, multiple, isotopes, the, mass, spectrometer, can, determine, the, proportion, of, each, isotope, in, the, sample, by, measuring, the, intensity, of, the, different, beams, of, ions, techniques, to, vaporize, atoms, include, inductively, coupled, plasma, atomic, emission, spectroscopy, and, inductively, coupled, plasma, mass, spectrometry, both, of, which, use, a, plasma, to, vaporize, samples, for, analysis, the, atom, probe, tomograph, has, sub, nanometer, resolution, in, 3, d, and, can, chemically, identify, individual, atoms, using, time, of, flight, mass, spectrometry, electron, emission, techniques, such, as, x, ray, photoelectron, spectroscopy, xps, and, auger, electron, spectroscopy, aes, which, measure, the, binding, energies, of, the, core, electrons, are, used, to, identify, the, atomic, species, present, in, a, sample, in, a, non, destructive, way, with, proper, focusing, both, can, be, made, area, specific, another, such, method, is, electron, energy, loss, spectroscopy, eels, which, measures, the, energy, loss, of, an, electron, beam, within, a, transmission, electron, microscope, when, it, interacts, with, a, portion, of, a, sample, spectra, of, excited, states, can, be, used, to, analyze, the, atomic, composition, of, distant, stars, specific, light, wavelengths, contained, in, the, observed, light, from, stars, can, be, separated, out, and, related, to, the, quantized, transitions, in, free, gas, atoms, these, colors, can, be, replicated, using, a, gas, discharge, lamp, containing, the, same, element, helium, was,

were, produced, in, supernovae, and, colliding, neutron, stars, through, the, r, process, and, in, agb, stars, through, the, s, process, both, of, which, involve, the, capture, of, neutrons, by, atomic, nuclei, elements, such, as, lead, formed, largely, through, the, radioactive, decay, of, heavier, elements, most, of, the, atoms, that, make, up, the, earth, and, its, inhabitants, were, present, in, their, current, form, in, the, nebula, that, collapsed, out, of, a, molecular, cloud, to, form, the, solar, system, the, rest, are, the, result, of, radioactive, decay, and, their, relative, proportion, can, be, used, to, determine, the, age, of, the, earth, through, radiometric, dating, most, of, the, helium, in, the, crust, of, the, earth, about, 99, of, the, helium, from, gas, wells, as, shown, by, its, lower, abundance, of, helium, 3, is, a, product, of, alpha, decay, there, are, a, few, trace, atoms, on, earth, that, were, not, present, at, the, beginning, i, e, not, primordial, nor, are, results, of, radioactive, decay, carbon, 14, is, continuously, generated, by, cosmic, rays, in, the, atmosphere, some, atoms, on, earth, have, been, artificially, generated, either, deliberately, or, as, by, products, of, nuclear, reactors, or, explosions, of, the, transuranic, elements, those, with, atomic, numbers, greater, than, 92, only, plutonium, and, neptunium, occur, naturally, on, earth, transuranic, elements, have, radioactive, lifetimes, shorter, than, the, current, age, of, the, earth, and, thus, identifiable, quantities, of, these, elements, have, long, since, decayed, with, the, exception, of, traces, of, plutonium, 244, possibly, deposited, by, cosmic, dust, natural, deposits, of, plutonium, and, neptunium, are, produced, by, neutron, capture, in, uranium, ore, the, earth, contains, approximately, 1, 33, 10, 50, atoms, although, small, numbers, of, independent, atoms, of, noble, gases, exist, such, as, argon, neon, and, helium, 99, of, the, atmosphere, is, bound, in, the, form, of, molecules, including, carbon, dioxide, and, diatomic, oxygen, and, nitrogen, at, the, surface, of, the, earth, an, overwhelming, majority, of, atoms, combine, to, form, various, compounds, including, water, salt, silicates, and, oxides, atoms, can, also, combine, to, create, materials, that, do, not, consist, of, discrete, molecules, including, crystals, and, liquid, or, solid, metals, this, atomic, matter, forms, networked, arrangements, that, lack, the, particular, type, of, small, scale, interrupted, order, associated, with, molecular, matter, all, nuclides, with, atomic, numbers, higher, than, 82, lead, are, known, to, be, radioactive, no, nuclide, with, an, atomic, number, exceeding, 92, uranium, exists, on, earth, as, a, primordial, nuclide, and, heavier, elements, generally, have, shorter, half, lives, nevertheless, an, island, of, stability, encompassing, relatively, long, lived, isotopes, of, superheavy, elements, with, atomic, numbers, 110, to, 114, might, exist, predictions, for, the, half, life, of, the, most, stable, nuclide, on, the, island, range, from, a, few, minutes, to, millions, of, years, in, any, case, superheavy, elements, with, z, 104, would, not, exist, due, to, increasing, coulomb, repulsion, which, results, in, spontaneous, fission, with, increasingly, short, half, lives, in, the, absence, of, any, stabilizing, effects, each, particle, of, matter, has, a, corresponding, antimatter, particle, with, the, opposite, electrical, charge, thus, the, positron, is, a, positively, charged, antielectron, and, the, antiproton, is, a, negatively, charged, equivalent, of, a, proton, when, a, matter, and, corresponding, antimatter, particle, meet, they, annihilate, each, other, because, of, this, along, with, an, imbalance, between, the, number, of, matter, and, antimatter, particles, the, latter, are, rare, in, the, universe, the, first, causes, of, this, imbalance, are, not, yet, fully, understood, although, theories, of, baryogenesis, may, offer, an, explanation, as, a, result, no, antimatter, atoms, have, been, discovered, in, nature, in, 1996, the, antimatter, counterpart, of, the, hydrogen, atom, antihydrogen, was, synthesized, at, the, cern, laboratory, in, geneva, other, exotic, atoms, have, been, created, by, replacing, one, of, the, protons, neutrons, or, electrons, with, other, particles, that, have, the, same, charge, for, example, an, electron, can, be, replaced, by, a, more, massive, muon, forming, a, muonic, atom, these, types, of, atoms, can, be, used, to, test, fundamental, predictions, of, physics
