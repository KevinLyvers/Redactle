oceanic, trenches, are, prominent, long, narrow, topographic, depressions, of, the, ocean, floor, they, are, typically, 50, to, 100, kilometers, 30, to, 60, mi, wide, and, 3, to, 4, km, 1, 9, to, 2, 5, mi, below, the, level, of, the, surrounding, oceanic, floor, but, can, be, thousands, of, kilometers, in, length, there, are, about, 50, 000, km, 31, 000, mi, of, oceanic, trenches, worldwide, mostly, around, the, pacific, ocean, but, also, in, the, eastern, indian, ocean, and, a, few, other, locations, the, greatest, ocean, depth, measured, is, in, the, challenger, deep, of, the, mariana, trench, at, a, depth, of, 10, 994, m, 36, 070, ft, below, sea, level, oceanic, trenches, are, a, feature, of, the, earth, s, distinctive, plate, tectonics, they, mark, the, locations, of, convergent, plate, boundaries, along, which, lithospheric, plates, move, towards, each, other, at, rates, that, vary, from, a, few, millimeters, to, over, ten, centimeters, per, year, oceanic, lithosphere, moves, into, trenches, at, a, global, rate, of, about, 3, km, 2, 1, 2, sq, mi, per, year, a, trench, marks, the, position, at, which, the, flexed, subducting, slab, begins, to, descend, beneath, another, lithospheric, slab, trenches, are, generally, parallel, to, and, about, 200, km, 120, mi, from, a, volcanic, arc, much, of, the, fluid, trapped, in, sediments, of, the, subducting, slab, returns, to, the, surface, at, the, oceanic, trench, producing, mud, volcanoes, and, cold, seeps, these, support, unique, biomes, based, on, chemotrophic, microorganisms, there, is, concern, that, plastic, debris, is, accumulating, in, trenches, and, threatening, these, communities, there, are, approximately, 50, 000, km, 31, 000, mi, of, convergent, plate, margins, worldwide, these, are, mostly, located, around, the, pacific, ocean, but, are, also, found, in, the, eastern, indian, ocean, with, a, few, shorter, convergent, margin, segments, in, other, parts, of, the, indian, ocean, in, the, atlantic, ocean, and, in, the, mediterranean, they, are, found, on, the, oceanward, side, of, island, arcs, and, andean, type, orogens, globally, there, are, over, 50, major, ocean, trenches, covering, an, area, of, 1, 9, million, km, 2, or, about, 0, 5, of, the, oceans, trenches, are, geomorphologically, distinct, from, troughs, troughs, are, elongated, depressions, of, the, sea, floor, with, steep, sides, and, flat, bottoms, while, trenches, are, characterized, by, a, v, shaped, profile, trenches, that, are, partially, infilled, are, sometimes, described, as, troughs, for, example, the, makran, trough, some, trenches, are, completely, buried, and, lack, bathymetric, expression, as, in, the, cascadia, subduction, zone, which, is, completely, filled, with, sediments, despite, their, appearance, in, these, instances, the, fundamental, plate, tectonic, structure, is, still, an, oceanic, trench, some, troughs, look, similar, to, oceanic, trenches, but, possess, other, tectonic, structures, one, example, is, the, lesser, antilles, trough, which, is, the, forearc, basin, of, the, lesser, antilles, subduction, zone, also, not, a, trench, is, the, new, caledonia, trough, which, is, an, extensional, sedimentary, basin, related, to, the, tonga, kermadec, subduction, zone, additionally, the, cayman, trough, which, is, a, pull, apart, basin, within, a, transform, fault, zone, is, not, an, oceanic, trench, trenches, along, with, volcanic, arcs, and, wadati, benioff, zones, zones, of, earthquakes, under, a, volcanic, arc, are, diagnostic, of, convergent, plate, boundaries, and, their, deeper, manifestations, subduction, zones, here, two, tectonic, plates, are, drifting, into, each, other, at, a, rate, of, a, few, millimeters, to, over, 10, centimeters, 4, in, per, year, at, least, one, of, the, plates, is, oceanic, lithosphere, which, plunges, under, the, other, plate, to, be, recycled, in, the, earth, s, mantle, trenches, are, related, to, but, distinct, from, continental, collision, zones, such, as, the, himalayas, unlike, in, trenches, in, continental, collision, zones, continental, crust, enters, a, subduction, zone, when, buoyant, continental, crust, enters, a, trench, subduction, comes, to, a, halt, and, the, area, becomes, a, zone, of, continental, collision, features, analogous, to, trenches, are, associated, with, collision, zones, one, such, feature, is, the, peripheral, foreland, basin, a, sediment, filled, foredeep, examples, of, peripheral, foreland, basins, include, the, floodplains, of, the, ganges, river, and, the, tigris, euphrates, river, system, trenches, were, not, clearly, defined, until, the, late, 1940s, and, 1950s, the, bathymetry, of, the, ocean, was, poorly, known, prior, to, the, challenger, expedition, of, 1872, 1876, which, took, 492, soundings, of, the, deep, ocean, at, station, 225, the, expedition, discovered, challenger, deep, now, known, to, be, the, southern, end, of, the, mariana, trench, the, laying, of, transatlantic, telegraph, cables, on, the, seafloor, between, the, continents, during, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, provided, further, motivation, for, improved, bathymetry, the, term, trench, in, its, modern, sense, of, a, prominent, elongated, depression, of, the, sea, bottom, was, first, used, by, johnstone, in, his, 1923, textbook, an, introduction, to, oceanography, during, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, felix, andries, vening, meinesz, measured, gravity, over, trenches, using, a, newly, developed, gravimeter, that, could, measure, gravity, from, aboard, a, submarine, he, proposed, the, tectogene, hypothesis, to, explain, the, belts, of, negative, gravity, anomalies, that, were, found, near, island, arcs, according, to, this, hypothesis, the, belts, were, zones, of, downwelling, of, light, crustal, rock, arising, from, subcrustal, convection, currents, the, tectogene, hypothesis, was, further, developed, by, griggs, in, 1939, using, an, analogue, model, based, on, a, pair, of, rotating, drums, harry, hammond, hess, substantially, revised, the, theory, based, on, his, geological, analysis, world, war, ii, in, the, pacific, led, to, great, improvements, of, bathymetry, particularly, in, the, western, pacific, in, light, of, these, new, measurements, the, linear, nature, of, the, deeps, became, clear, there, was, a, rapid, growth, of, deep, sea, research, efforts, especially, the, widespread, use, of, echosounders, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, these, efforts, confirmed, the, morphological, utility, of, the, term, trench, important, trenches, were, identified, sampled, and, mapped, via, sonar, the, early, phase, of, trench, exploration, reached, its, peak, with, the, 1960, descent, of, the, bathyscaphe, trieste, to, the, bottom, of, the, challenger, deep, following, robert, s, dietz, and, harry, hess, promulgation, of, the, seafloor, spreading, hypothesis, in, the, early, 1960s, and, the, plate, tectonic, revolution, in, the, late, 1960s, the, oceanic, trench, became, an, important, concept, in, plate, tectonic, theory, oceanic, trenches, are, 50, to, 100, kilometers, 30, to, 60, mi, wide, and, have, an, asymmetric, v, shape, with, the, steeper, slope, 8, to, 20, degrees, on, the, inner, overriding, side, of, the, trench, and, the, gentler, slope, around, 5, degrees, on, the, outer, subducting, side, of, the, trench, the, bottom, of, the, trench, marks, the, boundary, between, the, subducting, and, overriding, plates, known, as, the, basal, plate, boundary, shear, or, the, subduction, d, collement, the, depth, of, the, trench, depends, on, the, starting, depth, of, the, oceanic, lithosphere, as, it, begins, its, plunge, into, the, trench, the, angle, at, which, the, slab, plunges, and, the, amount, of, sedimentation, in, the, trench, both, starting, depth, and, subduction, angle, are, greater, for, older, oceanic, lithosphere, which, is, reflected, in, the, deep, trenches, of, the, western, pacific, here, the, bottoms, of, the, marianas, and, the, tonga, kermadec, trenches, are, up, to, 10, 11, kilometers, 6, 2, 6, 8, mi, below, sea, level, in, the, eastern, pacific, where, the, subducting, oceanic, lithosphere, is, much, younger, the, depth, of, the, peru, chile, trench, is, around, 7, to, 8, kilometers, 4, 3, to, 5, 0, mi, though, narrow, oceanic, trenches, are, remarkably, long, and, continuous, forming, the, largest, linear, depressions, on, earth, an, individual, trench, can, be, thousands, of, kilometers, long, most, trenches, are, convex, towards, the, subducting, slab, which, is, attributed, to, the, spherical, geometry, of, the, earth, the, trench, asymmetry, reflects, the, different, physical, mechanisms, that, determine, the, inner, and, outer, slope, angle, the, outer, slope, angle, of, the, trench, is, determined, by, the, bending, radius, of, the, subducting, slab, as, determined, by, its, elastic, thickness, since, oceanic, lithosphere, thickens, with, age, the, outer, slope, angle, is, ultimately, determined, by, the, age, of, the, subducting, slab, the, inner, slope, angle, is, determined, by, the, angle, of, repose, of, the, overriding, plate, edge, this, reflects, frequent, earthquakes, along, the, trench, that, prevent, oversteepening, of, the, inner, slope, as, the, subducting, plate, approaches, the, trench, it, bends, slightly, upwards, before, beginning, its, plunge, into, the, depths, as, a, result, the, outer, trench, slope, is, bounded, by, an, outer, trench, high, this, is, subtle, often, only, tens, of, meters, high, and, is, typically, located, a, few, tens, of, kilometers, from, the, trench, axis, on, the, outer, slope, itself, where, the, plate, begins, to, bend, downwards, into, the, trench, the, upper, part, of, the, subducting, slab, is, broken, by, bending, faults, that, give, the, outer, trench, slope, a, horst, and, graben, topography, the, formation, of, these, bending, faults, is, suppressed, where, oceanic, ridges, or, large, seamounts, are, subducting, into, the, trench, but, the, bending, faults, cut, right, across, smaller, seamounts, where, the, subducting, slab, is, only, thinly, veneered, with, sediments, the, outer, slope, will, often, show, seafloor, spreading, ridges, oblique, to, the, horst, and, graben, ridges, trench, morphology, is, strongly, modified, by, the, amount, of, sedimentation, in, the, trench, this, varies, from, practically, no, sedimentation, as, in, the, tonga, kermadec, trench, to, completely, filled, with, sediments, as, with, the, cascadia, subduction, zone, sedimentation, is, largely, controlled, by, whether, the, trench, is, near, a, continental, sediment, source, the, range, of, sedimentation, is, well, illustrated, by, the, chilean, trench, the, north, chile, portion, of, the, trench, which, lies, along, the, atacama, desert, with, its, very, slow, rate, of, weathering, is, sediment, starved, with, from, 20, to, a, few, hundred, meters, of, sediments, on, the, trench, floor, the, tectonic, morphology, of, this, trench, segment, is, fully, exposed, on, the, ocean, bottom, the, central, chile, segment, of, the, trench, is, moderately, sedimented, with, sediments, onlapping, onto, pelagic, sediments, or, ocean, basement, of, the, subducting, slab, but, the, trench, morphology, is, still, clearly, discernible, the, southern, chile, segment, of, the, trench, is, fully, sedimented, to, the, point, where, the, outer, rise, and, slope, are, no, longer, discernible, other, fully, sedimented, trenches, include, the, makran, trough, where, sediments, are, up, to, 7, 5, kilometers, 4, 7, mi, thick, the, cascadia, subduction, zone, which, is, completed, buried, by, 3, to, 4, kilometers, 1, 9, to, 2, 5, mi, of, sediments, and, the, northernmost, sumatra, subduction, zone, which, is, buried, under, 6, kilometers, 3, 7, mi, of, sediments, sediments, are, sometimes, transported, along, the, axis, of, an, oceanic, trench, the, central, chile, trench, experiences, transport, of, sediments, from, source, fans, along, an, axial, channel, similar, transport, of, sediments, has, been, documented, in, the, aleutian, trench, in, addition, to, sedimentation, from, rivers, draining, into, a, trench, sedimentation, also, takes, place, from, landslides, on, the, tectonically, steepened, inner, slope, often, driven, by, megathrust, earthquakes, the, reloca, slide, of, the, central, chile, trench, is, an, example, of, this, process, convergent, margins, are, classified, as, erosive, or, accretionary, and, this, has, a, strong, influence, on, the, morphology, of, the, inner, slope, of, the, trench, erosive, margins, such, as, the, northern, peru, chile, tonga, kermadec, and, mariana, trenches, correspond, to, sediment, starved, trenches, the, subducting, slab, erodes, material, from, the, lower, part, of, the, overriding, slab, reducing, its, volume, the, edge, of, the, slab, experiences, subsidence, and, steepening, with, normal, faulting, the, slope, is, underlain, by, relative, strong, igneous, and, metamorphic, rock, which, maintains, a, high, angle, of, repose, over, half, of, all, convergent, margins, are, erosive, margins, accretionary, margins, such, as, the, southern, peru, chile, cascadia, and, aleutians, are, associated, with, moderately, to, heavily, sedimented, trenches, as, the, slab, subducts, sediments, are, bulldozed, onto, the, edge, of, the, overriding, plate, producing, an, accretionary, wedge, or, accretionary, prism, this, builds, the, overriding, plate, outwards, because, the, sediments, lack, strength, their, angle, of, repose, is, gentler, than, the, rock, making, up, the, inner, slope, of, erosive, margin, trenches, the, inner, slope, is, underlain, by, imbricated, thrust, sheets, of, sediments, the, inner, slope, topography, is, roughened, by, localized, mass, wasting, cascadia, has, practically, no, bathymetric, expression, of, the, outer, rise, and, trench, due, to, complete, sediment, filling, but, the, inner, trench, slope, is, complex, with, many, thrust, ridges, these, compete, with, canyon, formation, by, rivers, draining, into, the, trench, inner, trench, slopes, of, erosive, margins, rarely, show, thrust, ridges, accretionary, prisms, grow, in, two, ways, the, first, is, by, frontal, accretion, in, which, sediments, are, scraped, off, the, downgoing, plate, and, emplaced, at, the, front, of, the, accretionary, prism, as, the, accretionary, wedge, grows, older, sediments, further, from, the, trench, become, increasingly, lithified, and, faults, and, other, structural, features, are, steepened, by, rotation, towards, the, trench, the, other, mechanism, for, accretionary, prism, growth, is, underplating, also, known, as, basal, accretion, of, subducted, sediments, together, with, some, oceanic, crust, along, the, shallow, parts, of, the, subduction, decollement, the, franciscan, group, of, california, is, interpreted, as, an, ancient, accretionary, prism, in, which, underplating, is, recorded, as, tectonic, m, langes, and, duplex, structures, frequent, megathrust, earthquakes, modify, the, inner, slope, of, the, trench, by, triggering, massive, landslides, these, leave, semicircular, landslide, scarps, with, slopes, of, up, to, 20, degrees, on, the, headwalls, and, sidewalls, subduction, of, seamounts, and, aseismic, ridges, into, the, trench, may, increase, aseismic, creep, and, reduce, the, severity, of, earthquakes, contrariwise, subduction, of, large, amounts, of, sediments, may, allow, ruptures, along, the, subduction, d, collement, to, propagate, for, great, distances, to, produce, megathrust, earthquakes, trenches, seem, positionally, stable, over, time, but, scientists, believe, that, some, trenches, particularly, those, associated, with, subduction, zones, where, two, oceanic, plates, converge, move, backward, into, the, subducting, plate, this, is, called, trench, rollback, or, hinge, retreat, also, hinge, rollback, and, is, one, explanation, for, the, existence, of, back, arc, basins, forces, perpendicular, to, the, slab, the, portion, of, the, subducting, plate, within, the, mantle, are, responsible, for, steepening, of, the, slab, and, ultimately, the, movement, of, the, hinge, and, trench, at, the, surface, these, forces, arise, from, the, negative, buoyancy, of, the, slab, with, respect, to, the, mantle, modified, by, the, geometry, of, the, slab, itself, the, extension, in, the, overriding, plate, in, response, to, the, subsequent, subhorizontal, mantle, flow, from, the, displacement, of, the, slab, can, result, in, formation, of, a, back, arc, basin, several, forces, are, involved, in, the, process, of, slab, rollback, two, forces, acting, against, each, other, at, the, interface, of, the, two, subducting, plates, exert, forces, against, one, another, the, subducting, plate, exerts, a, bending, force, fpb, that, supplies, pressure, during, subduction, while, the, overriding, plate, exerts, a, force, against, the, subducting, plate, fts, the, slab, pull, force, fsp, is, caused, by, the, negative, buoyancy, of, the, plate, driving, the, plate, to, greater, depths, the, resisting, force, from, the, surrounding, mantle, opposes, the, slab, pull, forces, interactions, with, the, 660, km, discontinuity, cause, a, deflection, due, to, the, buoyancy, at, the, phase, transition, f660, the, unique, interplay, of, these, forces, is, what, generates, slab, rollback, when, the, deep, slab, section, obstructs, the, down, going, motion, of, the, shallow, slab, section, slab, rollback, occurs, the, subducting, slab, undergoes, backward, sinking, due, to, the, negative, buoyancy, forces, causing, a, retrogradation, of, the, trench, hinge, along, the, surface, upwelling, of, the, mantle, around, the, slab, can, create, favorable, conditions, for, the, formation, of, a, back, arc, basin, seismic, tomography, provides, evidence, for, slab, rollback, results, demonstrate, high, temperature, anomalies, within, the, mantle, suggesting, subducted, material, is, present, in, the, mantle, ophiolites, are, viewed, as, evidence, for, such, mechanisms, as, high, pressure, and, temperature, rocks, are, rapidly, brought, to, the, surface, through, the, processes, of, slab, rollback, which, provides, space, for, the, exhumation, of, ophiolites, slab, rollback, is, not, always, a, continuous, process, suggesting, an, episodic, nature, the, episodic, nature, of, the, rollback, is, explained, by, a, change, in, the, density, of, the, subducting, plate, such, as, the, arrival, of, buoyant, lithosphere, a, continent, arc, ridge, or, plateau, a, change, in, the, subduction, dynamics, or, a, change, in, the, plate, kinematics, the, age, of, the, subducting, plates, does, not, have, any, effect, on, slab, rollback, nearby, continental, collisions, have, an, effect, on, slab, rollback, continental, collisions, induce, mantle, flow, and, extrusion, of, mantle, material, which, causes, stretching, and, arc, trench, rollback, in, the, area, of, the, southeast, pacific, there, have, been, several, rollback, events, resulting, in, the, formation, of, numerous, back, arc, basins, interactions, with, the, mantle, discontinuities, play, a, significant, role, in, slab, rollback, stagnation, at, the, 660, km, discontinuity, causes, retrograde, slab, motion, due, to, the, suction, forces, acting, at, the, surface, slab, rollback, induces, mantle, return, flow, which, causes, extension, from, the, shear, stresses, at, the, base, of, the, overriding, plate, as, slab, rollback, velocities, increase, circular, mantle, flow, velocities, also, increase, accelerating, extension, rates, extension, rates, are, altered, when, the, slab, interacts, with, the, discontinuities, within, the, mantle, at, 410, km, and, 660, km, depth, slabs, can, either, penetrate, directly, into, the, lower, mantle, or, can, be, retarded, due, to, the, phase, transition, at, 660, km, depth, creating, a, difference, in, buoyancy, an, increase, in, retrograde, trench, migration, slab, rollback, 2, 4, cm, yr, is, a, result, of, flattened, slabs, at, the, 660, km, discontinuity, where, the, slab, does, not, penetrate, into, the, lower, mantle, this, is, the, case, for, the, japan, java, and, izu, bonin, trenches, these, flattened, slabs, are, only, temporarily, arrested, in, the, transition, zone, the, subsequent, displacement, into, the, lower, mantle, is, caused, by, slab, pull, forces, or, the, destabilization, of, the, slab, from, warming, and, broadening, due, to, thermal, diffusion, slabs, that, penetrate, directly, into, the, lower, mantle, result, in, slower, slab, rollback, rates, 1, 3, cm, yr, such, as, the, mariana, arc, tonga, arcs, as, sediments, are, subducted, at, the, bottom, of, trenches, much, of, their, fluid, content, is, expelled, and, moves, back, along, the, subduction, d, collement, to, emerge, on, the, inner, slope, as, mud, volcanoes, and, cold, seeps, methane, clathrates, and, gas, hydrates, also, accumulate, in, the, inner, slope, and, there, is, concern, that, their, breakdown, could, contribute, to, global, warming, the, fluids, released, at, mud, volcanoes, and, cold, seeps, are, rich, in, methane, and, hydrogen, sulfide, providing, chemical, energy, for, chemotrophic, microorganisms, that, form, the, base, of, a, unique, trench, biome, cold, seep, communities, have, been, identified, in, the, inner, trench, slopes, of, the, western, pacific, especially, japan, south, america, barbados, the, mediterranean, makran, and, the, sunda, trench, these, are, found, at, depths, as, great, as, 6, 000, meters, 20, 000, ft, the, genome, of, the, extremophile, deinococcus, from, challenger, deep, has, sequenced, for, its, ecological, insights, and, potential, industrial, uses, because, trenches, are, the, lowest, points, in, the, ocean, floor, there, is, concern, that, plastic, debris, may, accumulate, in, trenches, and, endanger, the, fragile, trench, biomes, recent, measurements, where, the, salinity, and, temperature, of, the, water, was, measured, throughout, the, dive, have, uncertainties, of, about, 15, m, 49, ft, older, measurements, may, be, off, by, hundreds, of, meters, the, five, deepest, trenches, in, the, world
