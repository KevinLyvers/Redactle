in, geology, and, physical, geography, a, plateau, p, l, t, o, p, l, t, o, p, l, t, o, french, pl, plateaus, or, plateaux, also, called, a, high, plain, or, a, tableland, is, an, area, of, a, highland, consisting, of, flat, terrain, that, is, raised, sharply, above, the, surrounding, area, on, at, least, one, side, often, one, or, more, sides, have, deep, hills, or, escarpments, plateaus, can, be, formed, by, a, number, of, processes, including, upwelling, of, volcanic, magma, extrusion, of, lava, and, erosion, by, water, and, glaciers, plateaus, are, classified, according, to, their, surrounding, environment, as, intermontane, piedmont, or, continental, a, few, plateaus, may, have, a, small, flat, top, while, others, have, wider, ones, plateaus, can, be, formed, by, a, number, of, processes, including, upwelling, of, volcanic, magma, extrusion, of, lava, plate, tectonics, movements, and, erosion, by, water, and, glaciers, volcanic, plateaus, are, produced, by, volcanic, activity, the, columbia, plateau, in, the, north, western, united, states, is, an, example, they, may, be, formed, by, upwelling, of, volcanic, magma, or, extrusion, of, lava, the, underlining, mechanism, in, forming, plateaus, from, upwelling, starts, when, magma, rises, from, the, mantle, causing, the, ground, to, swell, upward, in, this, way, large, flat, areas, of, rock, are, uplifted, to, form, a, plateau, for, plateaus, formed, by, extrusion, the, rock, is, built, up, from, lava, spreading, outward, from, cracks, and, weak, areas, in, the, crust, tectonic, plateaus, are, formed, by, tectonic, plate, movements, which, cause, uplift, and, are, normally, of, a, considerable, size, and, a, fairly, uniform, altitude, examples, are, the, deccan, plateau, in, india, and, the, meseta, central, on, the, iberian, peninsula, plateaus, can, also, be, formed, by, the, erosional, processes, of, glaciers, on, mountain, ranges, leaving, them, sitting, between, the, mountain, ranges, water, can, also, erode, mountains, and, other, landforms, down, into, plateaus, dissected, plateaus, are, highly, eroded, plateaus, cut, by, rivers, and, broken, by, deep, narrow, valleys, an, example, is, the, scottish, highlands, plateaus, are, classified, according, to, their, surrounding, environment, the, highest, african, plateau, is, the, ethiopian, highlands, which, cover, the, central, part, of, ethiopia, it, forms, the, largest, continuous, area, of, its, altitude, in, the, continent, with, little, of, its, surface, falling, below, 1, 500, metres, 4, 921, ft, while, the, summits, reach, heights, of, up, to, 4, 550, metres, 14, 928, ft, it, is, sometimes, called, the, roof, of, africa, due, to, its, height, and, large, area, another, example, is, the, highveld, which, is, the, portion, of, the, south, african, inland, plateau, which, has, an, altitude, above, approximately, 1, 500, metres, but, below, 2, 100, metres, thus, excluding, the, lesotho, mountain, regions, it, is, home, to, some, of, the, largest, south, african, urban, agglomerations, in, egypt, are, the, giza, plateau, and, galala, mountain, which, was, once, called, gallayat, plateaus, rising, 3, 300, ft, above, sea, level, another, very, large, plateau, is, the, icy, antarctic, plateau, which, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, polar, plateau, or, king, haakon, vii, plateau, home, to, the, geographic, south, pole, and, the, amundsen, scott, south, pole, station, which, covers, most, of, east, antarctica, where, there, are, no, known, mountains, but, rather, 3, 000, m, 9, 800, ft, high, of, superficial, ice, and, which, spreads, very, slowly, toward, the, surrounding, coastline, through, enormous, glaciers, the, polar, ice, cap, is, so, massive, that, the, echolocation, measurements, of, ice, thickness, have, shown, that, large, areas, are, below, sea, level, but, as, the, ice, melts, the, land, beneath, will, rebound, through, isostasy, and, ultimately, rise, above, sea, level, the, largest, and, highest, plateau, in, the, world, is, the, tibetan, plateau, sometimes, metaphorically, described, as, the, roof, of, the, world, which, is, still, being, formed, by, the, collisions, of, the, indo, australian, and, eurasian, tectonic, plates, the, tibetan, plateau, covers, approximately, 2, 500, 000, km, 2, 970, 000, sq, mi, at, about, 5, 000, m, 16, 000, ft, above, sea, level, the, plateau, is, sufficiently, high, to, reverse, the, hadley, cell, convection, cycles, and, to, drive, the, monsoons, of, india, towards, the, south, the, deosai, plains, in, pakistan, are, situated, at, an, average, elevation, of, 4, 114, meters, 13, 497, ft, above, sea, level, they, are, considered, to, be, the, second, highest, plateaus, in, the, world, other, major, plateaus, in, asia, are, najd, on, the, arabian, peninsula, elevation, 762, to, 1, 525, m, 2, 500, to, 5, 003, ft, armenian, highlands, 400, 000, km, 2, 150, 000, sq, mi, elevation, 900, 2, 100, metres, 3, 000, 6, 900, ft, iranian, plateau, 3, 700, 000, km, 2, 1, 400, 000, sq, mi, elevation, 300, 1, 500, metres, 980, 4, 920, ft, anatolian, plateau, mongolian, plateau, 2, 600, 000, km, 2, 1, 000, 000, sq, mi, elevation, 1, 000, 1, 500, metres, 3, 300, 4, 900, ft, and, the, deccan, plateau, 1, 900, 000, km, 2, 730, 000, sq, mi, elevation, 300, 600, metres, 980, 1, 970, ft, a, large, plateau, in, north, america, is, the, colorado, plateau, which, covers, about, 337, 000, km, 2, 130, 000, sq, mi, in, colorado, arizona, new, mexico, and, utah, in, northern, arizona, and, southern, utah, the, colorado, plateau, is, bisected, by, the, colorado, river, and, the, grand, canyon, this, came, to, be, over, 10, million, years, ago, a, river, was, already, there, though, not, necessarily, on, exactly, the, same, course, then, subterranean, geological, forces, caused, the, land, in, that, part, of, north, america, to, gradually, rise, by, about, a, centimeter, per, year, for, millions, of, years, an, unusual, balance, occurred, the, river, that, would, become, the, colorado, river, was, able, to, erode, into, the, crust, of, the, earth, at, a, nearly, equal, rate, to, the, uplift, of, the, plateau, now, millions, of, years, later, the, north, rim, of, the, grand, canyon, is, at, an, elevation, of, about, 2, 450, m, 8, 040, ft, above, sea, level, and, the, south, rim, of, the, grand, canyon, is, about, 2, 150, m, 7, 050, ft, above, sea, level, at, its, deepest, the, colorado, river, is, about, 1, 830, m, 6, 000, ft, below, the, level, of, the, north, rim, another, high, altitude, plateau, in, north, america, is, the, mexican, plateau, with, an, area, of, 601, 882, km, 2, 232, 388, sq, mi, and, average, height, of, 1, 825, metres, it, is, the, home, of, more, than, 70, million, people, the, western, plateau, part, of, the, australian, shield, is, an, ancient, craton, covering, much, of, the, continent, s, southwest, an, area, of, some, 700, 000, square, kilometres, it, has, an, average, elevation, between, 305, and, 460, metres, the, north, island, volcanic, plateau, is, an, area, of, high, land, occupying, much, of, the, centre, of, the, north, island, of, new, zealand, with, volcanoes, lava, plateaus, and, crater, lakes, the, most, notable, of, which, is, the, country, s, largest, lake, lake, taup, the, plateau, stretches, approximately, 100, km, east, to, west, and, 130, km, north, to, south, the, majority, of, the, plateau, is, more, than, 600, metres, above, sea, level, a, tepui, t, p, w, i, or, tepuy, spanish, is, a, table, top, mountain, or, mesa, found, in, the, guiana, highlands, of, south, america, especially, in, venezuela, and, western, guyana, the, word, tepui, means, house, of, the, gods, in, the, native, tongue, of, the, pemon, the, indigenous, people, who, inhabit, the, gran, sabana, tepuis, can, be, considered, minute, plateaus, and, tend, to, be, found, as, isolated, entities, rather, than, in, connected, ranges, which, makes, them, the, host, of, a, unique, array, of, endemic, plant, and, animal, species, some, of, the, most, outstanding, tepuis, are, neblina, autana, auyan, and, mount, roraima, they, are, typically, composed, of, sheer, blocks, of, precambrian, quartz, arenite, sandstone, that, rise, abruptly, from, the, jungle, giving, rise, to, spectacular, natural, scenery, auy, n, tepui, is, the, source, of, angel, falls, the, world, s, tallest, waterfall, the, colombian, capital, city, of, bogota, sits, on, an, andean, plateau, known, as, the, altiplano, cundiboyacense, roughly, the, size, of, switzerland, averaging, a, height, of, 2, 600, m, 8, 500, ft, above, sea, level, this, northern, andean, plateau, is, situated, in, the, country, s, eastern, range, and, is, divided, into, three, main, flat, regions, the, bogot, savanna, the, valleys, of, ubat, and, chiquinquir, and, the, valleys, of, duitama, and, sogamoso, the, parallel, sierra, of, andes, delimit, one, of, the, world, highest, plateaux, the, altiplano, spanish, for, high, plain, andean, plateau, or, bolivian, plateau, it, lies, in, west, central, south, america, where, the, andes, are, at, their, widest, is, the, most, extensive, area, of, high, plateau, on, earth, outside, of, tibet, the, bulk, of, the, altiplano, lies, within, bolivian, and, peruvian, territory, while, its, southern, parts, lie, in, chile, the, altiplano, plateau, hosts, several, cities, like, puno, oruro, el, alto, and, la, paz, the, administrative, seat, of, bolivia, northeastern, altiplano, is, more, humid, than, the, southwestern, the, latter, of, which, hosts, several, salares, or, salt, flats, due, to, its, aridity, at, the, bolivia, peru, border, lies, lake, titicaca, the, largest, lake, in, south, america,
