in, chemistry, ph, p, i, e, t, pee, aych, also, referred, to, as, acidity, or, basicity, historically, denotes, potential, of, hydrogen, or, power, of, hydrogen, it, is, a, logarithmic, scale, used, to, specify, the, acidity, or, basicity, of, aqueous, solutions, acidic, solutions, solutions, with, higher, concentrations, of, hydrogen, h, ions, are, measured, to, have, lower, ph, values, than, basic, or, alkaline, solutions, the, ph, scale, is, logarithmic, and, inversely, indicates, the, activity, of, hydrogen, ions, in, the, solution, where, is, the, equilibrium, molar, concentration, of, h, m, mol, l, in, the, solution, at, 25, c, 77, f, solutions, with, a, ph, less, than, 7, are, acidic, and, solutions, with, a, ph, greater, than, 7, are, basic, solutions, with, a, ph, of, 7, at, 25, c, are, neutral, i, e, have, the, same, concentration, of, h, ions, as, oh, ions, i, e, the, same, as, pure, water, the, neutral, value, of, the, ph, depends, on, the, temperature, and, is, lower, than, 7, if, the, temperature, increases, above, 25, c, the, ph, range, is, commonly, given, as, zero, to, 14, but, a, ph, value, can, be, less, than, 0, for, very, concentrated, strong, acids, or, greater, than, 14, for, very, concentrated, strong, bases, the, ph, scale, is, traceable, to, a, set, of, standard, solutions, whose, ph, is, established, by, international, agreement, primary, ph, standard, values, are, determined, using, a, concentration, cell, with, transference, by, measuring, the, potential, difference, between, a, hydrogen, electrode, and, a, standard, electrode, such, as, the, silver, chloride, electrode, the, ph, of, aqueous, solutions, can, be, measured, with, a, glass, electrode, and, a, ph, meter, or, a, color, changing, indicator, measurements, of, ph, are, important, in, chemistry, agronomy, medicine, water, treatment, and, many, other, applications, in, 1909, the, danish, chemist, s, ren, peter, lauritz, s, rensen, introduced, the, concept, of, ph, at, the, carlsberg, laboratory, originally, using, the, notation, p, h, with, h, as, a, subscript, to, the, lowercase, p, the, concept, was, later, revised, in, 1924, to, the, modern, ph, to, accommodate, definitions, and, measurements, in, terms, of, electrochemical, cells, for, the, sign, p, i, propose, the, name, hydrogen, ion, exponent, and, the, symbol, p, h, then, for, the, hydrogen, ion, exponent, p, h, of, a, solution, the, negative, value, of, the, briggsian, logarithm, of, the, related, hydrogen, ion, normality, factor, is, to, be, understood, s, rensen, did, not, explain, why, he, used, the, letter, p, and, the, exact, meaning, of, the, letter, is, still, disputed, s, rensen, described, a, way, of, measuring, ph, using, potential, differences, and, it, represents, the, negative, power, of, 10, in, the, concentration, of, hydrogen, ions, the, letter, p, could, stand, for, the, french, puissance, german, potenz, or, danish, potens, all, meaning, power, or, it, could, mean, potential, all, of, these, words, start, with, the, letter, p, in, french, german, and, danish, which, were, the, languages, in, which, s, rensen, published, carlsberg, laboratory, was, french, speaking, german, was, the, dominant, language, of, scientific, publishing, s, rensen, was, danish, he, also, used, the, letter, q, in, much, the, same, way, elsewhere, in, the, paper, and, he, might, have, arbitrarily, labelled, the, test, solution, p, and, the, reference, solution, q, these, letters, are, often, paired, some, literature, sources, suggest, that, ph, stands, for, the, latin, term, pondus, hydrogenii, quantity, of, hydrogen, or, potentia, hydrogenii, power, of, hydrogen, although, this, is, not, supported, by, s, rensen, s, writings, in, modern, chemistry, the, p, stands, for, the, negative, decimal, logarithm, of, and, is, used, in, the, term, p, k, a, for, acid, dissociation, constants, so, ph, is, the, negative, decimal, logarithm, of, h, ion, concentration, while, poh, is, the, negative, decimal, logarithm, of, oh, ion, concentration, bacteriologist, alice, catherine, evans, who, influenced, dairying, and, food, safety, credited, william, mansfield, clark, and, colleagues, including, herself, with, developing, ph, measuring, methods, in, the, 1910s, which, had, a, wide, influence, on, laboratory, and, industrial, use, thereafter, in, her, memoir, she, does, not, mention, how, much, or, how, little, clark, and, colleagues, knew, about, s, rensen, s, work, a, few, years, prior, she, said, in, these, studies, dr, clark, s, attention, was, directed, to, the, effect, of, acid, on, the, growth, of, bacteria, he, found, that, it, is, the, intensity, of, the, acid, in, terms, of, hydrogen, ion, concentration, that, affects, their, growth, but, existing, methods, of, measuring, acidity, determined, the, quantity, not, the, intensity, of, the, acid, next, with, his, collaborators, dr, clark, developed, accurate, methods, for, measuring, hydrogen, ion, concentration, these, methods, replaced, the, inaccurate, titration, method, of, determining, the, acid, content, in, use, in, biologic, laboratories, throughout, the, world, also, they, were, found, to, be, applicable, in, many, industrial, and, other, processes, in, which, they, came, into, wide, usage, the, first, electronic, method, for, measuring, ph, was, invented, by, arnold, orville, beckman, a, professor, at, the, california, institute, of, technology, in, 1934, it, was, in, response, to, a, request, from, the, local, citrus, grower, sunkist, which, wanted, a, better, method, for, quickly, testing, the, ph, of, lemons, they, were, picking, from, their, nearby, orchards, the, ph, of, a, solution, is, defined, as, the, decimal, logarithm, of, the, reciprocal, of, the, hydrogen, ion, activity, a, h, mathematically, ph, is, expressed, as, for, example, for, a, solution, with, a, hydrogen, ion, activity, of, 5, 10, 6, i, e, the, concentration, of, hydrogen, ions, in, moles, per, litre, the, ph, of, the, solution, can, be, calculated, as, follows, the, concept, of, ph, was, developed, because, ion, selective, electrodes, which, are, used, to, measure, ph, respond, to, activity, the, electrode, potential, e, follows, the, nernst, equation, for, the, hydrogen, ion, which, can, be, expressed, as, where, e, is, a, measured, potential, e, 0, is, the, standard, electrode, potential, r, is, the, gas, constant, t, is, the, temperature, in, kelvin, f, is, the, faraday, constant, for, h, the, number, of, electrons, transferred, is, one, the, electrode, potential, is, proportional, to, ph, when, ph, is, defined, in, terms, of, activity, the, precise, measurement, of, ph, is, presented, in, international, standard, iso, 31, 8, as, follows, a, galvanic, cell, is, set, up, to, measure, the, electromotive, force, e, m, f, between, a, reference, electrode, and, an, electrode, sensitive, to, the, hydrogen, ion, activity, when, they, are, both, immersed, in, the, same, aqueous, solution, the, reference, electrode, may, be, a, silver, chloride, electrode, or, a, calomel, electrode, and, the, hydrogen, ion, selective, electrode, is, a, standard, hydrogen, electrode, firstly, the, cell, is, filled, with, a, solution, of, known, hydrogen, ion, activity, and, the, electromotive, force, e, s, is, measured, then, the, electromotive, force, e, x, of, the, same, cell, containing, the, solution, of, unknown, ph, is, measured, the, difference, between, the, two, measured, electromotive, force, values, is, proportional, to, ph, this, method, of, calibration, avoids, the, need, to, know, the, standard, electrode, potential, the, proportionality, constant, 1, z, is, ideally, equal, to, f, r, t, ln, 10, displaystyle, frac, f, rt, ln, 10, the, nernstian, slope, in, practice, a, glass, electrode, is, used, instead, of, the, cumbersome, hydrogen, electrode, a, combined, glass, electrode, has, an, in, built, reference, electrode, it, is, calibrated, against, buffer, solutions, of, known, hydrogen, ion, h, activity, proposed, by, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, iupac, two, or, more, buffer, solutions, are, used, in, order, to, accommodate, the, fact, that, the, slope, may, differ, slightly, from, ideal, to, calibrate, the, electrode, it, is, first, immersed, in, a, standard, solution, and, the, reading, on, a, ph, meter, is, adjusted, to, be, equal, to, the, standard, buffer, s, value, the, reading, from, a, second, standard, buffer, solution, is, then, adjusted, using, the, slope, control, to, be, equal, to, the, ph, for, that, solution, further, details, are, given, in, the, iupac, recommendations, when, more, than, two, buffer, solutions, are, used, the, electrode, is, calibrated, by, fitting, observed, ph, values, to, a, straight, line, with, respect, to, standard, buffer, values, commercial, standard, buffer, solutions, usually, come, with, information, on, the, value, at, 25, c, and, a, correction, factor, to, be, applied, for, other, temperatures, the, ph, scale, is, logarithmic, and, therefore, ph, is, a, dimensionless, quantity, this, was, the, original, definition, of, s, rensen, in, 1909, which, was, superseded, in, favor, of, ph, in, 1924, is, the, concentration, of, hydrogen, ions, denoted, in, modern, chemistry, more, correctly, the, thermodynamic, activity, of, h, in, dilute, solution, should, be, replaced, by, c, 0, where, the, standard, state, concentration, c, 0, 1, mol, l, this, ratio, is, a, pure, number, whose, logarithm, can, be, defined, it, is, possible, to, measure, the, concentration, of, hydrogen, ions, directly, using, an, electrode, calibrated, in, terms, of, hydrogen, ion, concentrations, one, common, method, is, to, titrate, a, solution, of, known, concentration, of, a, strong, acid, with, a, solution, of, known, concentration, of, strong, base, in, the, presence, of, a, relatively, high, concentration, of, background, electrolyte, by, knowing, the, concentrations, of, the, acid, and, base, the, concentration, of, hydrogen, ions, can, be, calculated, and, the, measured, potential, can, be, correlated, with, concentrations, the, calibration, is, usually, carried, out, using, a, gran, plot, this, procedure, makes, the, activity, of, hydrogen, ions, equal, to, the, numerical, value, of, concentration, the, glass, electrode, and, other, ion, selective, electrodes, should, be, calibrated, in, a, medium, similar, to, the, one, being, investigated, for, instance, if, one, wishes, to, measure, the, ph, of, a, seawater, sample, the, electrode, should, be, calibrated, in, a, solution, resembling, seawater, in, its, chemical, composition, the, difference, between, p, and, ph, is, quite, small, and, it, has, been, stated, that, ph, p, 0, 04, however, it, is, common, practice, to, use, the, term, ph, for, both, types, of, measurement, poh, is, sometimes, used, as, a, measure, of, the, concentration, of, hydroxide, ions, oh, by, definition, poh, is, the, negative, logarithm, to, the, base, 10, of, the, hydroxide, ion, concentration, mol, l, poh, values, can, be, derived, from, ph, measurements, and, vice, versa, the, concentration, of, hydroxide, ions, in, water, is, related, to, the, concentration, of, hydrogen, ions, by, where, k, w, is, the, self, ionization, constant, of, water, taking, logarithms, so, at, room, temperature, poh, 14, ph, however, this, relationship, is, not, strictly, valid, in, other, circumstances, such, as, in, measurements, of, soil, alkalinity, ph, can, be, measured, using, indicators, which, change, color, depending, on, the, ph, of, the, solution, they, are, in, by, comparing, the, color, of, a, test, solution, to, a, standard, color, chart, the, ph, can, be, estimated, to, the, nearest, whole, number, for, more, precise, measurements, the, color, can, be, measured, using, a, colorimeter, or, spectrophotometer, a, universal, indicator, is, a, mixture, of, several, indicators, that, can, provide, a, continuous, color, change, over, a, range, of, ph, values, typically, from, about, ph, 2, to, ph, 10, universal, indicator, paper, is, made, from, absorbent, paper, that, has, been, impregnated, with, universal, indicator, an, alternative, method, of, measuring, ph, is, using, an, electronic, ph, meter, which, directly, measures, the, voltage, difference, between, a, ph, sensitive, electrode, and, a, reference, electrode, ph, values, can, be, measured, in, non, aqueous, solutions, but, they, are, based, on, a, different, scale, from, aqueous, ph, values, because, the, standard, states, used, for, calculating, hydrogen, ion, concentrations, activities, are, different, the, hydrogen, ion, activity, a, h, is, defined, as, where, h, is, the, chemical, potential, of, the, hydrogen, ion, h, displaystyle, mu, ce, h, ominus, is, its, chemical, potential, in, the, chosen, standard, state, r, is, the, gas, constant, and, t, is, the, thermodynamic, temperature, therefore, ph, values, on, the, different, scales, cannot, be, compared, directly, because, of, differences, in, the, solvated, proton, ions, such, as, lyonium, ions, which, require, an, intersolvent, scale, which, involves, the, transfer, activity, coefficient, of, hydronium, lyonium, ion, ph, is, an, example, of, an, acidity, function, but, there, are, others, that, can, be, defined, for, example, the, hammett, acidity, function, h, 0, has, been, developed, in, connection, with, superacids, in, 2010, a, new, approach, to, measuring, ph, was, proposed, called, the, unified, absolute, ph, scale, this, approach, allows, for, a, common, reference, standard, to, be, used, across, different, solutions, regardless, of, their, ph, range, the, unified, absolute, ph, scale, is, based, on, the, absolute, chemical, potential, of, the, proton, as, defined, by, the, lewis, acid, base, theory, this, scale, is, applicable, to, liquids, gases, and, even, solids, the, advantages, of, the, unified, absolute, ph, scale, include, consistency, accuracy, and, applicability, to, a, wide, range, of, sample, types, it, is, precise, and, versatile, because, it, serves, as, a, common, reference, standard, for, ph, measurements, however, implementation, efforts, compatibility, with, existing, data, complexity, and, potential, costs, are, some, challenges, the, measurement, of, ph, can, become, difficult, at, extremely, acidic, or, alkaline, conditions, such, as, below, ph, 2, 5, ca, 0, 003, mol, dm, 3, acid, or, above, ph, 10, 5, above, ca, 0, 0003, mol, dm, 3, alkaline, this, is, due, to, the, breakdown, of, the, nernst, equation, in, such, conditions, when, using, a, glass, electrode, there, are, several, factors, that, contribute, to, this, problem, firstly, liquid, junction, potentials, may, not, be, independent, of, ph, secondly, the, high, ionic, strength, of, concentrated, solutions, can, affect, the, electrode, potentials, at, high, ph, the, glass, electrode, may, be, affected, by, alkaline, error, because, the, electrode, becomes, sensitive, to, the, concentration, of, cations, such, as, na, and, k, in, the, solution, to, overcome, these, problems, specially, constructed, electrodes, are, available, runoff, from, mines, or, mine, tailings, can, produce, some, extremely, low, ph, values, down, to, 3, 6, pure, water, has, a, ph, of, 7, at, 25, c, meaning, it, is, neutral, when, an, acid, is, dissolved, in, water, the, ph, will, be, less, than, 7, while, a, base, or, alkali, will, have, a, ph, greater, than, 7, a, strong, acid, such, as, hydrochloric, acid, at, concentration, 1, mol, dm, 3, has, a, ph, of, 0, while, a, strong, alkali, like, sodium, hydroxide, at, the, same, concentration, has, a, ph, of, 14, since, ph, is, a, logarithmic, scale, a, difference, of, one, in, ph, is, equivalent, to, a, tenfold, difference, in, hydrogen, ion, concentration, neutrality, is, not, exactly, 7, at, 25, c, but, 7, serves, as, a, good, approximation, in, most, cases, neutrality, occurs, when, the, concentration, of, hydrogen, ions, equals, the, concentration, of, hydroxide, ions, or, when, their, activities, are, equal, since, self, ionization, of, water, holds, the, product, of, these, concentration, k, w, it, can, be, seen, that, at, neutrality, k, w, or, ph, pk, w, 2, pk, w, is, approximately, 14, but, depends, on, ionic, strength, and, temperature, and, so, the, ph, of, neutrality, does, also, pure, water, and, a, solution, of, nacl, in, pure, water, are, both, neutral, since, dissociation, of, water, produces, equal, numbers, of, both, ions, however, the, ph, of, the, neutral, nacl, solution, will, be, slightly, different, from, that, of, neutral, pure, water, because, the, hydrogen, and, hydroxide, ions, activity, is, dependent, on, ionic, strength, so, k, w, varies, with, ionic, strength, when, pure, water, is, exposed, to, air, it, becomes, mildly, acidic, this, is, because, water, absorbs, carbon, dioxide, from, the, air, which, is, then, slowly, converted, into, bicarbonate, and, hydrogen, ions, essentially, creating, carbonic, acid, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, natural, resources, conservation, service, formerly, soil, conservation, service, classifies, soil, ph, ranges, as, follows, in, europe, topsoil, ph, is, influenced, by, soil, parent, material, erosional, effects, climate, and, vegetation, a, recent, map, of, topsoil, ph, in, europe, shows, the, alkaline, soils, in, mediterranean, hungary, east, romania, north, france, scandinavian, countries, portugal, poland, and, north, germany, have, more, acid, soils, plants, contain, ph, dependent, pigments, that, can, be, used, as, ph, indicators, such, as, those, found, in, hibiscus, red, cabbage, anthocyanin, and, grapes, red, wine, citrus, fruits, have, acidic, juice, primarily, due, to, the, presence, of, citric, acid, while, other, carboxylic, acids, can, be, found, in, various, living, systems, the, protonation, state, of, phosphate, derivatives, including, atp, is, ph, dependent, hemoglobin, an, oxygen, transport, enzyme, is, also, affected, by, ph, in, a, phenomenon, known, as, the, root, effect, the, ph, of, seawater, plays, an, important, role, in, the, ocean, s, carbon, cycle, there, is, evidence, of, ongoing, ocean, acidification, meaning, a, drop, in, ph, value, between, 1950, and, 2020, the, average, ph, of, the, ocean, surface, fell, from, approximately, 8, 15, to, 8, 05, carbon, dioxide, emissions, from, human, activities, are, the, primary, cause, of, ocean, acidification, with, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, levels, exceeding, 410, ppm, in, 2020, co, 2, from, the, atmosphere, is, absorbed, by, the, oceans, this, produces, carbonic, acid, h, 2, co, 3, which, dissociates, into, a, bicarbonate, ion, hco, 3, and, a, hydrogen, ion, h, the, presence, of, free, hydrogen, ions, h, lowers, the, ph, of, the, ocean, the, measurement, of, ph, in, seawater, is, complicated, by, the, chemical, properties, of, seawater, and, three, distinct, ph, scales, exist, in, chemical, oceanography, in, practical, terms, the, three, seawater, ph, scales, differ, in, their, ph, values, up, to, 0, 10, differences, that, are, much, larger, than, the, accuracy, of, ph, measurements, typically, required, in, particular, in, relation, to, the, ocean, s, carbonate, system, since, it, omits, consideration, of, sulfate, and, fluoride, ions, the, free, scale, is, significantly, different, from, both, the, total, and, seawater, scales, because, of, the, relative, unimportance, of, the, fluoride, ion, the, total, and, seawater, scales, differ, only, very, slightly, as, part, of, its, operational, definition, of, the, ph, scale, the, iupac, defines, a, series, of, buffer, solutions, across, a, range, of, ph, values, often, denoted, with, national, bureau, of, standards, nbs, or, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, nist, designation, these, solutions, have, a, relatively, low, ionic, strength, 0, 1, compared, to, that, of, seawater, 0, 7, and, as, a, consequence, are, not, recommended, for, use, in, characterizing, the, ph, of, seawater, since, the, ionic, strength, differences, cause, changes, in, electrode, potential, to, resolve, this, problem, an, alternative, series, of, buffers, based, on, artificial, seawater, was, developed, this, new, series, resolves, the, problem, of, ionic, strength, differences, between, samples, and, the, buffers, and, the, new, ph, scale, is, referred, to, as, the, total, scale, often, denoted, as, ph, t, the, total, scale, was, defined, using, a, medium, containing, sulfate, ions, these, ions, experience, protonation, h, so, 2, 4, hso, 4, such, that, the, total, scale, includes, the, effect, of, both, protons, free, hydrogen, ions, and, hydrogen, sulfate, ions, an, alternative, scale, the, free, scale, often, denoted, ph, f, omits, this, consideration, and, focuses, solely, on, f, in, principle, making, it, a, simpler, representation, of, hydrogen, ion, concentration, only, t, can, be, determined, therefore, f, must, be, estimated, using, the, and, the, stability, constant, of, hso, 4, k, s, however, it, is, difficult, to, estimate, k, s, in, seawater, limiting, the, utility, of, the, otherwise, more, straightforward, free, scale, another, scale, known, as, the, seawater, scale, often, denoted, ph, sws, takes, account, of, a, further, protonation, relationship, between, hydrogen, ions, and, fluoride, ions, h, f, hf, resulting, in, the, following, expression, for, sws, however, the, advantage, of, considering, this, additional, complexity, is, dependent, upon, the, abundance, of, fluoride, in, the, medium, in, seawater, for, instance, sulfate, ions, occur, at, much, greater, concentrations, 400, times, than, those, of, fluoride, as, a, consequence, for, most, practical, purposes, the, difference, between, the, total, and, seawater, scales, is, very, small, the, following, three, equations, summarize, the, three, scales, of, ph, the, ph, level, of, food, influences, its, flavor, texture, and, shelf, life, acidic, foods, such, as, citrus, fruits, tomatoes, and, vinegar, typically, have, a, ph, below, 4, 6, with, sharp, and, tangy, taste, while, basic, foods, tastes, bitter, or, soapy, maintaining, the, appropriate, ph, in, foods, is, essential, for, preventing, the, growth, of, harmful, microorganisms, the, alkalinity, of, vegetables, such, as, spinach, and, kale, can, also, influence, their, texture, and, color, during, cooking, the, ph, also, influences, the, maillard, reaction, which, is, responsible, for, the, browning, of, food, during, cooking, impacting, both, flavor, and, appearance, in, living, organisms, the, ph, of, various, body, fluids, cellular, compartments, and, organs, is, tightly, regulated, to, maintain, a, state, of, acid, base, balance, known, as, acid, base, homeostasis, acidosis, defined, by, blood, ph, below, 7, 35, is, the, most, common, disorder, of, acid, base, homeostasis, and, occurs, when, there, is, an, excess, of, acid, in, the, body, in, contrast, alkalosis, is, characterized, by, excessively, high, blood, ph, blood, ph, is, usually, slightly, basic, with, a, ph, of, 7, 365, referred, to, as, physiological, ph, in, biology, and, medicine, plaque, formation, in, teeth, can, create, a, local, acidic, environment, that, results, in, tooth, decay, through, demineralization, enzymes, and, other, proteins, have, an, optimal, ph, range, for, function, and, can, become, inactivated, or, denatured, outside, this, range, when, calculating, the, ph, of, a, solution, containing, acids, and, or, bases, a, chemical, speciation, calculation, is, used, to, determine, the, concentration, of, all, chemical, species, present, in, the, solution, the, complexity, of, the, procedure, depends, on, the, nature, of, the, solution, strong, acids, and, bases, are, compounds, that, are, almost, completely, dissociated, in, water, which, simplifies, the, calculation, however, for, weak, acids, a, quadratic, equation, must, be, solved, and, for, weak, bases, a, cubic, equation, is, required, in, general, a, set, of, non, linear, simultaneous, equations, must, be, solved, water, itself, is, a, weak, acid, and, a, weak, base, so, its, dissociation, must, be, taken, into, account, at, high, ph, and, low, solute, concentration, see, amphoterism, it, dissociates, according, to, the, equilibrium, with, a, dissociation, constant, k, w, defined, as, where, stands, for, the, concentration, of, the, aqueous, hydronium, ion, and, represents, the, concentration, of, the, hydroxide, ion, this, equilibrium, needs, to, be, taken, into, account, at, high, ph, and, when, the, solute, concentration, is, extremely, low, strong, acids, and, bases, are, compounds, that, are, essentially, fully, dissociated, in, water, this, means, that, in, an, acidic, solution, the, concentration, of, hydrogen, ions, h, can, be, considered, equal, to, the, concentration, of, the, acid, similarly, in, a, basic, solution, the, concentration, of, hydroxide, ions, oh, can, be, considered, equal, to, the, concentration, of, the, base, the, ph, of, a, solution, is, defined, as, the, negative, logarithm, of, the, concentration, of, h, and, the, poh, is, defined, as, the, negative, logarithm, of, the, concentration, of, oh, for, example, the, ph, of, a, 0, 01m, solution, of, hydrochloric, acid, hcl, is, equal, to, 2, ph, log, 10, 0, 01, while, the, poh, of, a, 0, 01m, solution, of, sodium, hydroxide, naoh, is, equal, to, 2, poh, log, 10, 0, 01, which, corresponds, to, a, ph, of, about, 12, however, self, ionization, of, water, must, also, be, considered, when, concentrations, of, a, strong, acid, or, base, is, very, low, or, high, for, instance, a, 5, 10, 8, m, solution, of, hcl, would, be, expected, to, have, a, ph, of, 7, 3, based, on, the, above, procedure, which, is, incorrect, as, it, is, acidic, and, should, have, a, ph, of, less, than, 7, in, such, cases, the, system, can, be, treated, as, a, mixture, of, the, acid, or, base, and, water, which, is, an, amphoteric, substance, by, accounting, for, the, self, ionization, of, water, the, true, ph, of, the, solution, can, be, calculated, for, example, a, 5, 10, 8, m, solution, of, hcl, would, have, a, ph, of, 6, 89, when, treated, as, a, mixture, of, hcl, and, water, the, self, ionization, equilibrium, of, solutions, of, sodium, hydroxide, at, higher, concentrations, must, also, be, considered, a, weak, acid, or, the, conjugate, acid, of, a, weak, base, can, be, treated, using, the, same, formalism, first, an, acid, dissociation, constant, is, defined, as, follows, electrical, charges, are, omitted, from, subsequent, equations, for, the, sake, of, generality, and, its, value, is, assumed, to, have, been, determined, by, experiment, this, being, so, there, are, three, unknown, concentrations, and, to, determine, by, calculation, two, additional, equations, are, needed, one, way, to, provide, them, is, to, apply, the, law, of, mass, conservation, in, terms, of, the, two, reagents, h, and, a, c, stands, for, analytical, concentration, in, some, texts, one, mass, balance, equation, is, replaced, by, an, equation, of, charge, balance, this, is, satisfactory, for, simple, cases, like, this, one, but, is, more, difficult, to, apply, to, more, complicated, cases, as, those, below, together, with, the, equation, defining, k, a, there, are, now, three, equations, in, three, unknowns, when, an, acid, is, dissolved, in, water, c, a, c, h, c, a, the, concentration, of, the, acid, so, after, some, further, algebraic, manipulation, an, equation, in, the, hydrogen, ion, concentration, may, be, obtained, solution, of, this, quadratic, equation, gives, the, hydrogen, ion, concentration, and, hence, p, or, more, loosely, ph, this, procedure, is, illustrated, in, an, ice, table, which, can, also, be, used, to, calculate, the, ph, when, some, additional, strong, acid, or, alkaline, has, been, added, to, the, system, that, is, when, c, a, c, h, for, example, what, is, the, ph, of, a, 0, 01m, solution, of, benzoic, acid, pk, a, 4, 19, for, alkaline, solutions, an, additional, term, is, added, to, the, mass, balance, equation, for, hydrogen, since, the, addition, of, hydroxide, reduces, the, hydrogen, ion, concentration, and, the, hydroxide, ion, concentration, is, constrained, by, the, self, ionization, equilibrium, to, be, equal, to, k, w, h, displaystyle, frac, k, w, ce, the, resulting, equation, is, some, systems, such, as, with, polyprotic, acids, are, amenable, to, spreadsheet, calculations, with, three, or, more, reagents, or, when, many, complexes, are, formed, with, general, formulae, such, as, a, p, b, q, h, r, the, following, general, method, can, be, used, to, calculate, the, ph, of, a, solution, for, example, with, three, reagents, each, equilibrium, is, characterized, by, an, equilibrium, constant, next, write, down, the, mass, balance, equations, for, each, reagent, there, are, no, approximations, involved, in, these, equations, except, that, each, stability, constant, is, defined, as, a, quotient, of, concentrations, not, activities, much, more, complicated, expressions, are, required, if, activities, are, to, be, used, there, are, three, simultaneous, equations, in, the, three, unknowns, and, because, the, equations, are, non, linear, and, their, concentrations, may, range, over, many, powers, of, 10, the, solution, of, these, equations, is, not, straightforward, however, many, computer, programs, are, available, which, can, be, used, to, perform, these, calculations, there, may, be, more, than, three, reagents, the, calculation, of, hydrogen, ion, concentrations, using, this, approach, is, a, key, element, in, the, determination, of, equilibrium, constants, by, potentiometric,
