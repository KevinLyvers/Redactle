a, 5, 77, c, 8, 80, ruthenium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, ru, and, atomic, number, 44, it, is, a, rare, transition, metal, belonging, to, the, platinum, group, of, the, periodic, table, like, the, other, metals, of, the, platinum, group, ruthenium, is, unreactive, to, most, other, chemicals, karl, ernst, claus, a, russian, born, scientist, of, baltic, german, ancestry, discovered, the, element, in, 1844, at, kazan, state, university, and, named, ruthenium, in, honor, of, russia, ruthenium, is, usually, found, as, a, minor, component, of, platinum, ores, the, annual, production, has, risen, from, about, 19, tonnes, in, 2009, to, some, 35, 5, tonnes, in, 2017, most, ruthenium, produced, is, used, in, wear, resistant, electrical, contacts, and, thick, film, resistors, a, minor, application, for, ruthenium, is, in, platinum, alloys, and, as, a, chemistry, catalyst, a, new, application, of, ruthenium, is, as, the, capping, layer, for, extreme, ultraviolet, photomasks, ruthenium, is, generally, found, in, ores, with, the, other, platinum, group, metals, in, the, ural, mountains, and, in, north, and, south, america, small, but, commercially, important, quantities, are, also, found, in, pentlandite, extracted, from, sudbury, ontario, and, in, pyroxenite, deposits, in, south, africa, ruthenium, a, polyvalent, hard, white, metal, is, a, member, of, the, platinum, group, and, is, in, group, 8, of, the, periodic, table, whereas, all, other, group, 8, elements, have, two, electrons, in, the, outermost, shell, in, ruthenium, the, outermost, shell, has, only, one, electron, the, final, electron, is, in, a, lower, shell, this, anomaly, is, observed, in, the, neighboring, metals, niobium, 41, molybdenum, 42, and, rhodium, 45, ruthenium, has, four, crystal, modifications, and, does, not, tarnish, at, ambient, conditions, it, oxidizes, upon, heating, to, 800, c, 1, 070, k, ruthenium, dissolves, in, fused, alkalis, to, give, ruthenates, ruo, 2, 4, it, is, not, attacked, by, acids, even, aqua, regia, but, is, attacked, by, sodium, hypochlorite, at, room, temperature, and, halogens, at, high, temperatures, ruthenium, is, most, readily, attacked, by, oxidizing, agents, small, amounts, of, ruthenium, can, increase, the, hardness, of, platinum, and, palladium, the, corrosion, resistance, of, titanium, is, increased, markedly, by, the, addition, of, a, small, amount, of, ruthenium, the, metal, can, be, plated, by, electroplating, and, by, thermal, decomposition, a, ruthenium, molybdenum, alloy, is, known, to, be, superconductive, at, temperatures, below, 10, 6, k, ruthenium, is, the, only, 4d, transition, metal, that, can, assume, the, group, oxidation, state, 8, and, even, then, it, is, less, stable, there, than, the, heavier, congener, osmium, this, is, the, first, group, from, the, left, of, the, table, where, the, second, and, third, row, transition, metals, display, notable, differences, in, chemical, behavior, like, iron, but, unlike, osmium, ruthenium, can, form, aqueous, cations, in, its, lower, oxidation, states, of, 2, and, 3, ruthenium, is, the, first, in, a, downward, trend, in, the, melting, and, boiling, points, and, atomization, enthalpy, in, the, 4d, transition, metals, after, the, maximum, seen, at, molybdenum, because, the, 4d, subshell, is, more, than, half, full, and, the, electrons, are, contributing, less, to, metallic, bonding, technetium, the, previous, element, has, an, exceptionally, low, value, that, is, off, the, trend, due, to, its, half, filled, 4d, 5, 5s, 2, configuration, though, it, is, not, as, far, off, the, trend, in, the, 4d, series, as, manganese, in, the, 3d, transition, series, unlike, the, lighter, congener, iron, ruthenium, is, paramagnetic, at, room, temperature, as, iron, also, is, above, its, curie, point, the, reduction, potentials, in, acidic, aqueous, solution, for, some, common, ruthenium, species, are, shown, below, naturally, occurring, ruthenium, is, composed, of, seven, stable, isotopes, additionally, 34, radioactive, isotopes, have, been, discovered, of, these, radioisotopes, the, most, stable, are, 106, ru, with, a, half, life, of, 373, 59, days, 103, ru, with, a, half, life, of, 39, 26, days, and, 97, ru, with, a, half, life, of, 2, 9, days, fifteen, other, radioisotopes, have, been, characterized, with, atomic, weights, ranging, from, 89, 93, u, 90, ru, to, 114, 928, u, 115, ru, most, of, these, have, half, lives, that, are, less, than, five, minutes, except, 95, ru, half, life, 1, 643, hours, and, 105, ru, half, life, 4, 44, hours, the, primary, decay, mode, before, the, most, abundant, isotope, 102, ru, is, electron, capture, while, the, primary, mode, after, is, beta, emission, the, primary, decay, product, before, 102, ru, is, technetium, and, the, primary, decay, product, after, is, rhodium, 106, ru, is, a, product, of, fission, of, a, nucleus, of, uranium, or, plutonium, high, concentrations, of, detected, atmospheric, 106, ru, were, associated, with, an, alleged, undeclared, nuclear, accident, in, russia, in, 2017, ruthenium, is, found, in, about, 100, parts, per, trillion, in, the, crust, making, it, the, 78th, most, abundant, element, it, is, generally, found, in, ores, with, the, other, platinum, group, metals, in, the, ural, mountains, and, in, north, and, south, america, small, but, commercially, important, quantities, are, also, found, in, pentlandite, extracted, from, sudbury, ontario, canada, and, in, pyroxenite, deposits, in, south, africa, the, native, form, of, ruthenium, is, a, very, rare, mineral, ir, replaces, part, of, ru, in, its, structure, ruthenium, has, a, relatively, high, fission, product, yield, in, nuclear, fission, and, given, that, its, most, long, lived, radioisotope, has, a, half, life, of, only, around, a, year, there, are, often, proposals, to, recover, ruthenium, in, a, new, kind, of, nuclear, reprocessing, from, spent, fuel, an, unusual, ruthenium, deposit, can, also, be, found, at, the, natural, nuclear, fission, reactor, that, was, active, in, oklo, gabon, some, two, billion, years, ago, indeed, the, isotope, ratio, of, ruthenium, found, there, was, one, of, several, ways, used, to, confirm, that, a, nuclear, fission, chain, reaction, had, indeed, occurred, at, that, site, in, the, geological, past, uranium, is, no, longer, mined, at, oklo, and, there, have, never, been, serious, attempts, to, recover, any, of, the, platinum, group, metals, present, there, roughly, 30, tonnes, of, ruthenium, are, mined, each, year, with, world, reserves, estimated, at, 5, 000, tonnes, the, composition, of, the, mined, platinum, group, metal, pgm, mixtures, varies, widely, depending, on, the, geochemical, formation, for, example, the, pgms, mined, in, south, africa, contain, on, average, 11, ruthenium, while, the, pgms, mined, in, the, former, ussr, contain, only, 2, 1992, ruthenium, osmium, and, iridium, are, considered, the, minor, platinum, group, metals, ruthenium, like, the, other, platinum, group, metals, is, obtained, commercially, as, a, by, product, from, nickel, and, copper, and, platinum, metals, ore, processing, during, electrorefining, of, copper, and, nickel, noble, metals, such, as, silver, gold, and, the, platinum, group, metals, precipitate, as, anode, mud, the, feedstock, for, the, extraction, the, metals, are, converted, to, ionized, solutes, by, any, of, several, methods, depending, on, the, composition, of, the, feedstock, one, representative, method, is, fusion, with, sodium, peroxide, followed, by, dissolution, in, aqua, regia, and, solution, in, a, mixture, of, chlorine, with, hydrochloric, acid, osmium, ruthenium, rhodium, and, iridium, are, insoluble, in, aqua, regia, and, readily, precipitate, leaving, the, other, metals, in, solution, rhodium, is, separated, from, the, residue, by, treatment, with, molten, sodium, bisulfate, the, insoluble, residue, containing, ru, os, and, ir, is, treated, with, sodium, oxide, in, which, ir, is, insoluble, producing, dissolved, ru, and, os, salts, after, oxidation, to, the, volatile, oxides, ruo, 4, is, separated, from, oso, 4, by, precipitation, of, nh, 4, 3, rucl, 6, with, ammonium, chloride, or, by, distillation, or, extraction, with, organic, solvents, of, the, volatile, osmium, tetroxide, hydrogen, is, used, to, reduce, ammonium, ruthenium, chloride, yielding, a, powder, the, product, is, reduced, using, hydrogen, yielding, the, metal, as, a, powder, or, sponge, metal, that, can, be, treated, with, powder, metallurgy, techniques, or, argon, arc, welding, ruthenium, is, contained, in, spent, nuclear, fuel, both, as, a, direct, fission, product, and, as, a, product, of, neutron, absorption, by, long, lived, fission, product, 99, tc, after, allowing, the, unstable, isotopes, of, ruthenium, to, decay, chemical, extraction, could, yield, ruthenium, for, use, or, sale, in, all, applications, ruthenium, is, otherwise, used, for, ruthenium, can, also, be, produced, by, deliberate, nuclear, transmutation, from, 99, tc, given, the, relatively, long, half, life, high, fission, product, yield, and, high, chemical, mobility, in, the, environment, 99, tc, is, among, the, most, often, proposed, non, actinides, for, commercial, scale, nuclear, transmutation, 99, tc, has, a, relatively, big, neutron, cross, section, and, given, that, technetium, has, no, stable, isotopes, a, sample, would, not, run, into, the, problem, of, neutron, activation, of, stable, isotopes, significant, amounts, of, 99, tc, are, produced, both, by, nuclear, fission, and, nuclear, medicine, which, makes, ample, use, of, 99m, tc, which, decays, to, 99, tc, exposing, the, 99, tc, target, to, strong, enough, neutron, radiation, will, eventually, yield, appreciable, quantities, of, ruthenium, which, can, be, chemically, separated, and, sold, while, consuming, 99, tc, the, oxidation, states, of, ruthenium, range, from, 0, to, 8, and, 2, the, properties, of, ruthenium, and, osmium, compounds, are, often, similar, the, 2, 3, and, 4, states, are, the, most, common, the, most, prevalent, precursor, is, ruthenium, trichloride, a, red, solid, that, is, poorly, defined, chemically, but, versatile, synthetically, ruthenium, can, be, oxidized, to, ruthenium, iv, oxide, ruo, 2, oxidation, state, 4, which, can, in, turn, be, oxidized, by, sodium, metaperiodate, to, the, volatile, yellow, tetrahedral, ruthenium, tetroxide, ruo, 4, an, aggressive, strong, oxidizing, agent, with, structure, and, properties, analogous, to, osmium, tetroxide, ruo, 4, is, mostly, used, as, an, intermediate, in, the, purification, of, ruthenium, from, ores, and, radiowastes, dipotassium,

to, oxidise, dilute, hydrochloric, acid, and, organic, solvents, like, ethanol, at, room, temperature, and, is, easily, reduced, to, ruthenate, ruo, 2, 4, in, aqueous, alkaline, solutions, it, decomposes, to, form, the, dioxide, above, 100, c, unlike, iron, but, like, osmium, ruthenium, does, not, form, oxides, in, its, lower, 2, and, 3, oxidation, states, ruthenium, forms, di, chalcogenides, which, are, diamagnetic, semiconductors, crystallizing, in, the, pyrite, structure, ruthenium, sulfide, rus, 2, occurs, naturally, as, the, mineral, laurite, like, iron, ruthenium, does, not, readily, form, oxoanions, and, prefers, to, achieve, high, coordination, numbers, with, hydroxide, ions, instead, ruthenium, tetroxide, is, reduced, by, cold, dilute, potassium, hydroxide, to, form, black, potassium, perruthenate, kruo, 4, with, ruthenium, in, the, 7, oxidation, state, potassium, perruthenate, can, also, be, produced, by, oxidising, potassium, ruthenate, k, 2, ruo, 4, with, chlorine, gas, the, perruthenate, ion, is, unstable, and, is, reduced, by, water, to, form, the, orange, ruthenate, potassium, ruthenate, may, be, synthesized, by, reacting, ruthenium, metal, with, molten, potassium, hydroxide, and, potassium, nitrate, some, mixed, oxides, are, also, known, such, as, m, ii, ru, iv, o, 3, na, 3, ru, v, o, 4, na, 2, ru, v, 2, o, 7, and, m, ii, 2, ln, iii, ru, v, o, 6, the, highest, known, ruthenium, halide, is, the, hexafluoride, a, dark, brown, solid, that, melts, at, 54, c, it, hydrolyzes, violently, upon, contact, with, water, and, easily, disproportionates, to, form, a, mixture, of, lower, ruthenium, fluorides, releasing, fluorine, gas, ruthenium, pentafluoride, is, a, tetrameric, dark, green, solid, that, is, also, readily, hydrolyzed, melting, at, 86, 5, c, the, yellow, ruthenium, tetrafluoride, is, probably, also, polymeric, and, can, be, formed, by, reducing, the, pentafluoride, with, iodine, among, the, binary, compounds, of, ruthenium, these, high, oxidation, states, are, known, only, in, the, oxides, and, fluorides, ruthenium, trichloride, is, a, well, known, compound, existing, in, a, black, form, and, a,

naturally, occurring, platinum, alloys, containing, all, six, platinum, group, metals, were, used, for, a, long, time, by, pre, columbian, americans, and, known, as, a, material, to, european, chemists, from, the, mid, 16th, century, not, until, the, mid, 18th, century, was, platinum, identified, as, a, pure, element, that, natural, platinum, contained, palladium, rhodium, osmium, and, iridium, was, discovered, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 19th, century, platinum, in, alluvial, sands, of, russian, rivers, gave, access, to, raw, material, for, use, in, plates, and, medals, and, for, the, minting, of, ruble, coins, starting, in, 1828, residues, from, platinum, production, for, coinage, were, available, in, the, russian, empire, and, therefore, most, of, the, research, on, them, was, done, in, eastern, europe, it, is, possible, that, the, polish, chemist, j, drzej, niadecki, isolated, element, 44, which, he, called, vestium, after, the, asteroid, vesta, discovered, shortly, before, from, south, american, platinum, ores, in, 1807, he, published, an, announcement, of, his, discovery, in, 1808, his, work, was, never, confirmed, however, and, he, later, withdrew, his, claim, of, discovery, j, ns, berzelius, and, gottfried, osann, nearly, discovered, ruthenium, in, 1827, they, examined, residues, that, were, left, after, dissolving, crude, platinum, from, the, ural, mountains, in, aqua, regia, berzelius, did, not, find, any, unusual, metals, but, osann, thought, he, found, three, new, metals, which, he, called, pluranium, ruthenium, and, polinium, this, discrepancy, led, to, a, long, standing, controversy, between, berzelius, and, osann, about, the, composition, of, the, residues, as, osann, was, not, able, to, repeat, his, isolation, of, ruthenium, he, eventually, relinquished, his, claims, the, name, ruthenium, was, chosen, by, osann, because, the, analysed, samples, stemmed, from, the, ural, mountains, in, russia, the, name, itself, derives, from, the, latin, word, ruthenia, this, word, was, used, at, the, time, as, the, latin, name, for, russia, in, 1844, karl, ernst, claus, a, russian, scientist, of, baltic, german, descent, showed, that, the, compounds, prepared, by, gottfried, osann, contained, small, amounts, of, ruthenium, which, claus, had, discovered, the, same, year, claus, isolated, ruthenium, from, the, platinum, residues, of, rouble, production, while, he, was, working, in, kazan, university, kazan, the, same, way, its, heavier, congener, osmium, had, been, discovered, four, decades, earlier, claus, showed, that, ruthenium, oxide, contained, a, new, metal, and, obtained, 6, grams, of, ruthenium, from, the, part, of, crude, platinum, that, is, insoluble, in, aqua, regia, choosing, the, name, for, the, new, element, claus, stated, i, named, the, new, body, in, honour, of, my, motherland, ruthenium, i, had, every, right, to, call, it, by, this, name, because, mr, osann, relinquished, his, ruthenium, and, the, word, does, not, yet, exist, in, chemistry, in, doing, so, claus, started, a, trend, that, continues, to, this, day, naming, an, element, after, a, country, approximately, 30, 9, tonnes, of, ruthenium, were, consumed, in, 2016, 13, 8, of, them, in, electrical, applications, 7, 7, in, catalysis, and, 4, 6, in, electrochemistry, because, it, hardens, platinum, and, palladium, alloys,
