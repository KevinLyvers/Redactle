a, molecule, is, a, group, of, two, or, more, atoms, held, together, by, attractive, forces, known, as, chemical, bonds, depending, on, context, the, term, may, or, may, not, include, ions, which, satisfy, this, criterion, in, quantum, physics, organic, chemistry, and, biochemistry, the, distinction, from, ions, is, dropped, and, molecule, is, often, used, when, referring, to, polyatomic, ions, a, molecule, may, be, homonuclear, that, is, it, consists, of, atoms, of, one, chemical, element, e, g, two, atoms, in, the, oxygen, molecule, o, 2, or, it, may, be, heteronuclear, a, chemical, compound, composed, of, more, than, one, element, e, g, water, two, hydrogen, atoms, and, one, oxygen, atom, h, 2, o, in, the, kinetic, theory, of, gases, the, term, molecule, is, often, used, for, any, gaseous, particle, regardless, of, its, composition, this, relaxes, the, requirement, that, a, molecule, contains, two, or, more, atoms, since, the, noble, gases, are, individual, atoms, atoms, and, complexes, connected, by, non, covalent, interactions, such, as, hydrogen, bonds, or, ionic, bonds, are, typically, not, considered, single, molecules, concepts, similar, to, molecules, have, been, discussed, since, ancient, times, but, modern, investigation, into, the, nature, of, molecules, and, their, bonds, began, in, the, 17th, century, refined, over, time, by, scientists, such, as, robert, boyle, amedeo, avogadro, jean, perrin, and, linus, pauling, the, study, of, molecules, is, today, known, as, molecular, physics, or, molecular, chemistry, according, to, merriam, webster, and, the, online, etymology, dictionary, the, word, molecule, derives, from, the, latin, moles, or, small, unit, of, mass, the, word, is, derived, from, french, mol, cule, 1678, from, neo, latin, molecula, diminutive, of, latin, moles, mass, barrier, the, word, which, until, the, late, 18th, century, was, used, only, in, latin, form, became, popular, after, being, used, in, works, of, philosophy, by, descartes, the, definition, of, the, molecule, has, evolved, as, knowledge, of, the, structure, of, molecules, has, increased, earlier, definitions, were, less, precise, defining, molecules, as, the, smallest, particles, of, pure, chemical, substances, that, still, retain, their, composition, and, chemical, properties, this, definition, often, breaks, down, since, many, substances, in, ordinary, experience, such, as, rocks, salts, and, metals, are, composed, of, large, crystalline, networks, of, chemically, bonded, atoms, or, ions, but, are, not, made, of, discrete, molecules, the, modern, concept, of, molecules, can, be, traced, back, towards, pre, scientific, and, greek, philosophers, such, as, leucippus, and, democritus, who, argued, that, all, the, universe, is, composed, of, atoms, and, voids, circa, 450, bc, empedocles, imagined, fundamental, elements, fire, earth, air, and, water, and, forces, of, attraction, and, repulsion, allowing, the, elements, to, interact, a, fifth, element, the, incorruptible, quintessence, aether, was, considered, to, be, the, fundamental, building, block, of, the, heavenly, bodies, the, viewpoint, of, leucippus, and, empedocles, along, with, the, aether, was, accepted, by, aristotle, and, passed, to, medieval, and, renaissance, europe, in, a, more, concrete, manner, however, the, concept, of, aggregates, or, units, of, bonded, atoms, i, e, molecules, traces, its, origins, to, robert, boyle, s, 1661, hypothesis, in, his, famous, treatise, the, sceptical, chymist, that, matter, is, composed, of, clusters, of, particles, and, that, chemical, change, results, from, the, rearrangement, of, the, clusters, boyle, argued, that, matter, s, basic, elements, consisted, of, various, sorts, and, sizes, of, particles, called, corpuscles, which, were, capable, of, arranging, themselves, into, groups, in, 1789, william, higgins, published, views, on, what, he, called, combinations, of, ultimate, particles, which, foreshadowed, the, concept, of, valency, bonds, if, for, example, according, to, higgins, the, force, between, the, ultimate, particle, of, oxygen, and, the, ultimate, particle, of, nitrogen, were, 6, then, the, strength, of, the, force, would, be, divided, accordingly, and, similarly, for, the, other, combinations, of, ultimate, particles, amedeo, avogadro, created, the, word, molecule, his, 1811, paper, essay, on, determining, the, relative, masses, of, the, elementary, molecules, of, bodies, he, essentially, states, i, e, according, to, partington, s, a, short, history, of, chemistry, that, the, smallest, particles, of, gases, are, not, necessarily, simple, atoms, but, are, made, up, of, a, certain, number, of, these, atoms, united, by, attraction, to, form, a, single, molecule, in, coordination, with, these, concepts, in, 1833, the, french, chemist, marc, antoine, auguste, gaudin, presented, a, clear, account, of, avogadro, s, hypothesis, regarding, atomic, weights, by, making, use, of, volume, diagrams, which, clearly, show, both, semi, correct, molecular, geometries, such, as, a, linear, water, molecule, and, correct, molecular, formulas, such, as, h, 2, o, in, 1917, an, unknown, american, undergraduate, chemical, engineer, named, linus, pauling, was, learning, the, dalton, hook, and, eye, bonding, method, which, was, the, mainstream, description, of, bonds, between, atoms, at, the, time, pauling, however, was, not, satisfied, with, this, method, and, looked, to, the, newly, emerging, field, of, quantum, physics, for, a, new, method, in, 1926, french, physicist, jean, perrin, received, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, proving, conclusively, the, existence, of, molecules, he, did, this, by, calculating, the, avogadro, constant, using, three, different, methods, all, involving, liquid, phase, systems, first, he, used, a, gamboge, soap, like, emulsion, second, by, doing, experimental, work, on, brownian, motion, and, third, by, confirming, einstein, s, theory, of, particle, rotation, in, the, liquid, phase, in, 1927, the, physicists, fritz, london, and, walter, heitler, applied, the, new, quantum, mechanics, to, the, deal, with, the, saturable, nondynamic, forces, of, attraction, and, repulsion, i, e, exchange, forces, of, the, hydrogen, molecule, their, valence, bond, treatment, of, this, problem, in, their, joint, paper, was, a, landmark, in, that, it, brought, chemistry, under, quantum, mechanics, their, work, was, an, influence, on, pauling, who, had, just, received, his, doctorate, and, visited, heitler, and, london, in, z, rich, on, a, guggenheim, fellowship, subsequently, in, 1931, building, on, the, work, of, heitler, and, london, and, on, theories, found, in, lewis, famous, article, pauling, published, his, ground, breaking, article, the, nature, of, the, chemical, bond, in, which, he, used, quantum, mechanics, to, calculate, properties, and, structures, of, molecules, such, as, angles, between, bonds, and, rotation, about, bonds, on, these, concepts, pauling, developed, hybridization, theory, to, account, for, bonds, in, molecules, such, as, ch, 4, in, which, four, sp, hybridised, orbitals, are, overlapped, by, hydrogen, s, 1s, orbital, yielding, four, sigma, bonds, the, four, bonds, are, of, the, same, length, and, strength, which, yields, a, molecular, structure, as, shown, below, the, science, of, molecules, is, called, molecular, chemistry, or, molecular, physics, depending, on, whether, the, focus, is, on, chemistry, or, physics, molecular, chemistry, deals, with, the, laws, governing, the, interaction, between, molecules, that, results, in, the, formation, and, breakage, of, chemical, bonds, while, molecular, physics, deals, with, the, laws, governing, their, structure, and, properties, in, practice, however, this, distinction, is, vague, in, molecular, sciences, a, molecule, consists, of, a, stable, system, bound, state, composed, of, two, or, more, atoms, polyatomic, ions, may, sometimes, be, usefully, thought, of, as, electrically, charged, molecules, the, term, unstable, molecule, is, used, for, very, reactive, species, i, e, short, lived, assemblies, resonances, of, electrons, and, nuclei, such, as, radicals, molecular, ions, rydberg, molecules, transition, states, van, der, waals, complexes, or, systems, of, colliding, atoms, as, in, bose, einstein, condensate, molecules, as, components, of, matter, are, common, they, also, make, up, most, of, the, oceans, and, atmosphere, most, organic, substances, are, molecules, the, substances, of, life, are, molecules, e, g, proteins, the, amino, acids, of, which, they, are, composed, the, nucleic, acids, dna, and, rna, sugars, carbohydrates, fats, and, vitamins, the, nutrient, minerals, are, generally, ionic, compounds, thus, they, are, not, molecules, e, g, iron, sulfate, however, the, majority, of, familiar, solid, substances, on, earth, are, made, partly, or, completely, of, crystals, or, ionic, compounds, which, are, not, made, of, molecules, these, include, all, of, the, minerals, that, make, up, the, substance, of, the, earth, sand, clay, pebbles, rocks, boulders, bedrock, the, molten, interior, and, the, core, of, the, earth, all, of, these, contain, many, chemical, bonds, but, are, not, made, of, identifiable, molecules, no, typical, molecule, can, be, defined, for, salts, nor, for, covalent, crystals, although, these, are, often, composed, of, repeating, unit, cells, that, extend, either, in, a, plane, e, g, graphene, or, three, dimensionally, e, g, diamond, quartz, sodium, chloride, the, theme, of, repeated, unit, cellular, structure, also, holds, for, most, metals, which, are, condensed, phases, with, metallic, bonding, thus, solid, metals, are, not, made, of, molecules, in, glasses, which, are, solids, that, exist, in, a, vitreous, disordered, state, the, atoms, are, held, together, by, chemical, bonds, with, no, presence, of, any, definable, molecule, nor, any, of, the, regularity, of, repeating, unit, cellular, structure, that, characterizes, salts, covalent, crystals, and, metals, molecules, are, generally, held, together, by, covalent, bonding, several, non, metallic, elements, exist, only, as, molecules, in, the, environment, either, in, compounds, or, as, homonuclear, molecules, not, as, free, atoms, for, example, hydrogen, while, some, people, say, a, metallic, crystal, can, be, considered, a, single, giant, molecule, held, together, by, metallic, bonding, others, point, out, that, metals, behave, very, differently, than, molecules, a, covalent, bond, is, a, chemical, bond, that, involves, the, sharing, of, electron, pairs, between, atoms, these, electron, pairs, are, termed, shared, pairs, or, bonding, pairs, and, the, stable, balance, of, attractive, and, repulsive, forces, between, atoms, when, they, share, electrons, is, termed, covalent, bonding, ionic, bonding, is, a, type, of, chemical, bond, that, involves, the, electrostatic, attraction, between, oppositely, charged, ions, and, is, the, primary, interaction, occurring, in, ionic, compounds, the, ions, are, atoms, that, have, lost, one, or, more, electrons, termed, cations, and, atoms, that, have, gained, one, or, more, electrons, termed, anions, this, transfer, of, electrons, is, termed, electrovalence, in, contrast, to, covalence, in, the, simplest, case, the, cation, is, a, metal, atom, and, the, anion, is, a, nonmetal, atom, but, these, ions, can, be, of, a, more, complicated, nature, e, g, molecular, ions, like, nh, 4, or, so, 4, 2, at, normal, temperatures, and, pressures, ionic, bonding, mostly, creates, solids, or, occasionally, liquids, without, separate, identifiable, molecules, but, the, vaporization, sublimation, of, such, materials, does, produce, separate, molecules, where, electrons, are, still, transferred, fully, enough, for, the, bonds, to, be, considered, ionic, rather, than, covalent, most, molecules, are, far, too, small, to, be, seen, with, the, naked, eye, although, molecules, of, many, polymers, can, reach, macroscopic, sizes, including, biopolymers, such, as, dna, molecules, commonly, used, as, building, blocks, for, organic, synthesis, have, a, dimension, of, a, few, angstroms, to, several, dozen, or, around, one, billionth, of, a, meter, single, molecules, cannot, usually, be, observed, by, light, as, noted, above, but, small, molecules, and, even, the, outlines, of, individual, atoms, may, be, traced, in, some, circumstances, by, use, of, an, atomic, force, microscope, some, of, the, largest, molecules, are, macromolecules, or, supermolecules, the, smallest, molecule, is, the, diatomic, hydrogen, h, 2, with, a, bond, length, of, 0, 74, effective, molecular, radius, is, the, size, a, molecule, displays, in, solution, the, table, of, permselectivity, for, different, substances, contains, examples, the, chemical, formula, for, a, molecule, uses, one, line, of, chemical, element, symbols, numbers, and, sometimes, also, other, symbols, such, as, parentheses, dashes, brackets, and, plus, and, minus, signs, these, are, limited, to, one, typographic, line, of, symbols, which, may, include, subscripts, and, superscripts, a, compound, s, empirical, formula, is, a, very, simple, type, of, chemical, formula, it, is, the, simplest, integer, ratio, of, the, chemical, elements, that, constitute, it, for, example, water, is, always, composed, of, a, 2, 1, ratio, of, hydrogen, to, oxygen, atoms, and, ethanol, ethyl, alcohol, is, always, composed, of, carbon, hydrogen, and, oxygen, in, a, 2, 6, 1, ratio, however, this, does, not, determine, the, kind, of, molecule, uniquely, dimethyl, ether, has, the, same, ratios, as, ethanol, for, instance, molecules, with, the, same, atoms, in, different, arrangements, are, called, isomers, also, carbohydrates, for, example, have, the, same, ratio, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, 1, 2, 1, and, thus, the, same, empirical, formula, but, different, total, numbers, of, atoms, in, the, molecule, the, molecular, formula, reflects, the, exact, number, of, atoms, that, compose, the, molecule, and, so, characterizes, different, molecules, however, different, isomers, can, have, the, same, atomic, composition, while, being, different, molecules, the, empirical, formula, is, often, the, same, as, the, molecular, formula, but, not, always, for, example, the, molecule, acetylene, has, molecular, formula, c, 2, h, 2, but, the, simplest, integer, ratio, of, elements, is, ch, the, molecular, mass, can, be, calculated, from, the, chemical, formula, and, is, expressed, in, conventional, atomic, mass, units, equal, to, 1, 12, of, the, mass, of, a, neutral, carbon, 12, 12, c, isotope, atom, for, network, solids, the, term, formula, unit, is, used, in, stoichiometric, calculations, for, molecules, with, a, complicated, 3, dimensional, structure, especially, involving, atoms, bonded, to, four, different, substituents, a, simple, molecular, formula, or, even, semi, structural, chemical, formula, may, not, be, enough, to, completely, specify, the, molecule, in, this, case, a, graphical, type, of, formula, called, a, structural, formula, may, be, needed, structural, formulas, may, in, turn, be, represented, with, a, one, dimensional, chemical, name, but, such, chemical, nomenclature, requires, many, words, and, terms, which, are, not, part, of, chemical, formulas, molecules, have, fixed, equilibrium, geometries, bond, lengths, and, angles, about, which, they, continuously, oscillate, through, vibrational, and, rotational, motions, a, pure, substance, is, composed, of, molecules, with, the, same, average, geometrical, structure, the, chemical, formula, and, the, structure, of, a, molecule, are, the, two, important, factors, that, determine, its, properties, particularly, its, reactivity, isomers, share, a, chemical, formula, but, normally, have, very, different, properties, because, of, their, different, structures, stereoisomers, a, particular, type, of, isomer, may, have, very, similar, physico, chemical, properties, and, at, the, same, time, different, biochemical, activities, molecular, spectroscopy, deals, with, the, response, spectrum, of, molecules, interacting, with, probing, signals, of, known, energy, or, frequency, according, to, the, planck, relation, molecules, have, quantized, energy, levels, that, can, be, analyzed, by, detecting, the, molecule, s, energy, exchange, through, absorbance, or, emission, spectroscopy, does, not, generally, refer, to, diffraction, studies, where, particles, such, as, neutrons, electrons, or, high, energy, x, rays, interact, with, a, regular, arrangement, of, molecules, as, in, a, crystal, microwave, spectroscopy, commonly, measures, changes, in, the, rotation, of, molecules, and, can, be, used, to, identify, molecules, in, outer, space, infrared, spectroscopy, measures, the, vibration, of, molecules, including, stretching, bending, or, twisting, motions, it, is, commonly, used, to, identify, the, kinds, of, bonds, or, functional, groups, in, molecules, changes, in, the, arrangements, of, electrons, yield, absorption, or, emission, lines, in, ultraviolet, visible, or, near, infrared, light, and, result, in, colour, nuclear, resonance, spectroscopy, measures, the, environment, of, particular, nuclei, in, the, molecule, and, can, be, used, to, characterise, the, numbers, of, atoms, in, different, positions, in, a, molecule, the, study, of, molecules, by, molecular, physics, and, theoretical, chemistry, is, largely, based, on, quantum, mechanics, and, is, essential, for, the, understanding, of, the, chemical, bond, the, simplest, of, molecules, is, the, hydrogen, molecule, ion, h, 2, and, the, simplest, of, all, the, chemical, bonds, is, the, one, electron, bond, h, 2, is, composed, of, two, positively, charged, protons, and, one, negatively, charged, electron, which, means, that, the, schr, dinger, equation, for, the, system, can, be, solved, more, easily, due, to, the, lack, of, electron, electron, repulsion, with, the, development, of, fast, digital, computers, approximate, solutions, for, more, complicated, molecules, became, possible, and, are, one, of, the, main, aspects, of, computational, chemistry, when, trying, to, define, rigorously, whether, an, arrangement, of, atoms, is, sufficiently, stable, to, be, considered, a, molecule, iupac, suggests, that, it, must, correspond, to, a, depression, on, the, potential, energy, surface, that, is, deep, enough, to, confine, at, least, one, vibrational, state, this, definition, does, not, depend, on, the, nature, of, the, interaction, between, the, atoms, but, only, on, the, strength, of, the, interaction, in, fact, it, includes, weakly, bound, species, that, would, not, traditionally, be, considered, molecules, such, as, the, helium, dimer, he, 2, which, has, one, vibrational, bound, state, and, is, so, loosely, bound, that, it, is, only, likely, to, be, observed, at, very, low, temperatures, whether, or, not, an, arrangement, of, atoms, is, sufficiently, stable, to, be, considered, a, molecule, is, inherently, an, operational, definition, philosophically, therefore, a, molecule, is, not, a, fundamental, entity, in, contrast, for, instance, to, an, elementary, particle, rather, the, concept, of, a, molecule, is, the, chemist, s, way, of, making, a, useful, statement, about, the, strengths, of, atomic, scale, interactions, in, the, world, that, we, observe
