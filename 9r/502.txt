in, organic, chemistry, an, aldehyde, l, d, h, a, d, is, an, organic, compound, containing, a, functional, group, with, the, structure, r, ch, o, the, functional, group, itself, without, the, r, side, chain, can, be, referred, to, as, an, aldehyde, but, can, also, be, classified, as, a, formyl, group, aldehydes, are, a, common, motif, in, many, chemicals, important, in, technology, and, biology, aldehyde, molecules, have, a, central, carbon, atom, that, is, connected, by, a, double, bond, to, oxygen, a, single, bond, to, hydrogen, and, another, single, bond, to, a, third, substituent, which, is, carbon, or, in, the, case, of, formaldehyde, hydrogen, the, central, carbon, is, often, described, as, being, sp, 2, hybridized, the, aldehyde, group, is, somewhat, polar, the, c, o, bond, length, is, about, 120, 122, picometers, aldehydes, have, properties, that, are, diverse, and, that, depend, on, the, remainder, of, the, molecule, smaller, aldehydes, are, more, soluble, in, water, formaldehyde, and, acetaldehyde, completely, so, the, volatile, aldehydes, have, pungent, odors, aldehydes, can, be, identified, by, spectroscopic, methods, using, ir, spectroscopy, they, display, a, strong, co, band, near, 1700, cm, 1, in, their, 1, h, nmr, spectra, the, formyl, hydrogen, center, absorbs, near, h, 9, 5, to, 10, which, is, a, distinctive, part, of, the, spectrum, this, signal, shows, the, characteristic, coupling, to, any, protons, on, the, carbon, with, a, small, coupling, constant, typically, less, than, 3, 0, hz, the, 13, c, nmr, spectra, of, aldehydes, and, ketones, gives, a, suppressed, weak, but, distinctive, signal, at, c, 190, to, 205, important, aldehydes, and, related, compounds, the, aldehyde, group, or, formyl, group, is, colored, red, from, the, left, 1, formaldehyde, and, 2, its, trimer, 1, 3, 5, trioxane, 3, acetaldehyde, and, 4, its, enol, vinyl, alcohol, 5, glucose, pyranose, form, as, d, glucopyranose, 6, the, flavorant, cinnamaldehyde, 7, retinal, which, forms, with, opsins, photoreceptors, and, 8, the, vitamin, pyridoxal, traces, of, many, aldehydes, are, found, in, essential, oils, and, often, contribute, to, their, favorable, odours, e, g, cinnamaldehyde, cilantro, and, vanillin, possibly, because, of, the, high, reactivity, of, the, formyl, group, aldehydes, are, not, common, in, several, of, the, natural, building, blocks, amino, acids, nucleic, acids, lipids, most, sugars, however, are, derivatives, of, aldehydes, these, aldoses, exist, as, hemiacetals, a, sort, of, masked, form, of, the, parent, aldehyde, for, example, in, aqueous, solution, only, a, tiny, fraction, of, glucose, exists, as, the, aldehyde, there, are, several, methods, for, preparing, aldehydes, but, the, dominant, technology, is, hydroformylation, illustrative, is, the, generation, of, butyraldehyde, by, hydroformylation, of, propene, aldehydes, are, commonly, generated, by, alcohol, oxidation, industry, oxidizes, methanol, to, formaldehyde, on, a, large, scale, and, in, the, wacker, process, ethylene, to, acetaldehyde, in, the, presence, of, copper, and, palladium, catalysts, acetaldehyde, is, also, produced, on, a, large, scale, by, acetylene, hydration, green, and, cheap, oxygen, is, the, oxidant, of, choice, for, sensitive, substrates, oppenauer, transfer, oxidation, avoids, overoxidation, to, a, carboxylic, acid, when, a, mixture, of, products, may, be, acceptable, hydroformylation, directly, adds, a, carbonyl, to, a, olefin, laboratories, may, instead, apply, a, wide, variety, of, specialized, oxidizing, agents, chromium, vi, reagents, are, popular, oxidation, can, be, achieved, by, heating, the, alcohol, with, an, acidified, solution, of, potassium, dichromate, in, this, case, excess, dichromate, will, further, oxidize, the, aldehyde, to, a, carboxylic, acid, so, either, the, aldehyde, is, distilled, out, as, it, forms, if, volatile, or, milder, reagents, such, as, pcc, are, used, a, variety, of, reagent, systems, achieve, aldehydes, under, chromium, free, conditions, one, such, are, the, hypervalent, organoiodine, compounds, i, e, ibx, acid, dess, martin, periodinane, although, these, often, also, oxidize, the, position, a, lux, flood, acid, will, activate, other, pre, oxidized, substrates, various, sulfoxides, e, g, the, swern, oxidation, or, amine, oxides, e, g, the, ganem, oxidation, sterically, hindered, nitroxyls, i, e, tempo, can, catalyze, aldehyde, formation, with, a, cheaper, oxidant, alternatively, vicinal, diols, or, their, oxidized, sequelae, acyloins, or, hydroxy, acids, can, be, oxidized, with, cleavage, to, two, aldehydes, or, an, aldehyde, and, carbon, dioxide, aldehydes, participate, in, many, reactions, from, the, industrial, perspective, important, reactions, are, because, of, resonance, stabilization, of, the, conjugate, base, an, hydrogen, in, an, aldehyde, is, weakly, acidic, with, a, p, k, a, near, 17, note, however, this, is, much, more, acidic, than, an, alkane, or, ether, hydrogen, which, has, p, k, a, near, 50, approximately, and, is, even, more, acidic, than, a, ketone, hydrogen, which, has, p, k, a, near, 20, this, acidification, of, the, hydrogen, in, aldehyde, is, attributed, to, the, formyl, proton, itself, does, not, readily, undergo, deprotonation, aldehydes, except, those, without, an, alpha, carbon, or, without, protons, on, the, alpha, carbon, such, as, formaldehyde, and, benzaldehyde, can, exist, in, either, the, keto, or, the, enol, tautomer, keto, enol, tautomerism, is, catalyzed, by, either, acid, or, base, in, neutral, solution, the, enol, is, the, minority, tautomer, reversing, several, times, per, second, but, it, becomes, the, dominant, tautomer, in, strong, acid, or, base, solutions, and, enolized, aldehydes, undergo, nucleophilic, attack, at, the, position, the, formyl, group, can, be, readily, reduced, to, a, primary, alcohol, ch, 2, oh, typically, this, conversion, is, accomplished, by, catalytic, hydrogenation, either, directly, or, by, transfer, hydrogenation, stoichiometric, reductions, are, also, popular, as, can, be, effected, with, sodium, borohydride, the, formyl, group, readily, oxidizes, to, the, corresponding, carboxyl, group, cooh, the, preferred, oxidant, in, industry, is, oxygen, or, air, in, the, laboratory, popular, oxidizing, agents, include, potassium, permanganate, nitric, acid, chromium, vi, oxide, and, chromic, acid, the, combination, of, manganese, dioxide, cyanide, acetic, acid, and, methanol, will, convert, the, aldehyde, to, a, methyl, ester, another, oxidation, reaction, is, the, basis, of, the, silver, mirror, test, in, this, test, an, aldehyde, is, treated, with, tollens, reagent, which, is, prepared, by, adding, a, drop, of, sodium, hydroxide, solution, into, silver, nitrate, solution, to, give, a, precipitate, of, silver, i, oxide, and, then, adding, just, enough, dilute, ammonia, solution, to, redissolve, the, precipitate, in, aqueous, ammonia, to, produce, complex, this, reagent, converts, aldehydes, to, carboxylic, acids, without, attacking, carbon, carbon, double, bonds, the, name, silver, mirror, test, arises, because, this, reaction, produces, a, precipitate, of, silver, whose, presence, can, be, used, to, test, for, the, presence, of, an, aldehyde, a, further, oxidation, reaction, involves, fehling, s, reagent, as, a, test, the, cu, 2, complex, ions, are, reduced, to, a, red, brick, coloured, cu, 2, o, precipitate, if, the, aldehyde, cannot, form, an, enolate, e, g, benzaldehyde, addition, of, strong, base, induces, the, cannizzaro, reaction, this, reaction, results, in, disproportionation, producing, a, mixture, of, alcohol, and, carboxylic, acid, nucleophiles, add, readily, to, the, carbonyl, group, in, the, product, the, carbonyl, carbon, becomes, sp, 3, hybridized, being, bonded, to, the, nucleophile, and, the, oxygen, center, becomes, protonated, in, many, cases, a, water, molecule, is, removed, after, the, addition, takes, place, in, this, case, the, reaction, is, classed, as, an, addition, elimination, or, addition, condensation, reaction, there, are, many, variations, of, nucleophilic, addition, reactions, in, the, acetalisation, reaction, under, acidic, or, basic, conditions, an, alcohol, adds, to, the, carbonyl, group, and, a, proton, is, transferred, to, form, a, hemiacetal, under, acidic, conditions, the, hemiacetal, and, the, alcohol, can, further, react, to, form, an, acetal, and, water, simple, hemiacetals, are, usually, unstable, although, cyclic, ones, such, as, glucose, can, be, stable, acetals, are, stable, but, revert, to, the, aldehyde, in, the, presence, of, acid, aldehydes, can, react, with, water, to, form, hydrates, r, ch, oh, 2, these, diols, are, stable, when, strong, electron, withdrawing, groups, are, present, as, in, chloral, hydrate, the, mechanism, of, formation, is, identical, to, hemiacetal, formation, in, alkylimino, de, oxo, bisubstitution, a, primary, or, secondary, amine, adds, to, the, carbonyl, group, and, a, proton, is, transferred, from, the, nitrogen, to, the, oxygen, atom, to, create, a, carbinolamine, in, the, case, of, a, primary, amine, a, water, molecule, can, be, eliminated, from, the, carbinolamine, intermediate, to, yield, an, imine, or, its, trimer, a, hexahydrotriazine, this, reaction, is, catalyzed, by, acid, hydroxylamine, nh, 2, oh, can, also, add, to, the, carbonyl, group, after, the, elimination, of, water, this, results, in, an, oxime, an, ammonia, derivative, of, the, form, h, 2, nnr, 2, such, as, hydrazine, h, 2, nnh, 2, or, 2, 4, dinitrophenylhydrazine, can, also, be, the, nucleophile, and, after, the, elimination, of, water, resulting, in, the, formation, of, a, hydrazone, which, are, usually, orange, crystalline, solids, this, reaction, forms, the, basis, of, a, test, for, aldehydes, and, ketones, the, cyano, group, in, hcn, can, add, to, the, carbonyl, group, to, form, cyanohydrins, r, ch, oh, cn, in, this, reaction, the, cn, ion, is, the, nucleophile, that, attacks, the, partially, positive, carbon, atom, of, the, carbonyl, group, the, mechanism, involves, a, pair, of, electrons, from, the, carbonyl, group, double, bond, transferring, to, the, oxygen, atom, leaving, it, single, bonded, to, carbon, and, giving, the, oxygen, atom, a, negative, charge, this, intermediate, ion, rapidly, reacts, with, h, such, as, from, the, hcn, molecule, to, form, the, alcohol, group, of, the, cyanohydrin, organometallic, compounds, such, as, organolithium, reagents, grignard, reagents, or, acetylides, undergo, nucleophilic, addition, reactions, yielding, a, substituted, alcohol, group, related, reactions, include, organostannane, additions, barbier, reactions, and, the, nozaki, hiyama, kishi, reaction, in, the, aldol, reaction, the, metal, enolates, of, ketones, esters, amides, and, carboxylic, acids, add, to, aldehydes, to, form, hydroxycarbonyl, compounds, aldols, acid, or, base, catalyzed, dehydration, then, leads, to, unsaturated, carbonyl, compounds, the, combination, of, these, two, steps, is, known, as, the, aldol, condensation, the, prins, reaction, occurs, when, a, nucleophilic, alkene, or, alkyne, reacts, with, an, aldehyde, as, electrophile, the, product, of, the, prins, reaction, varies, with, reaction, conditions, and, substrates, employed, aldehydes, characteristically, form, addition, compounds, with, bisulfites, this, reaction, is, used, as, a, test, for, aldehydes, and, is, useful, for, separation, or, purification, of, aldehydes, a, dialdehyde, is, an, organic, chemical, compound, with, two, aldehyde, groups, the, nomenclature, of, dialdehydes, have, the, ending, dial, or, sometimes, dialdehyde, short, aliphatic, dialdehydes, are, sometimes, named, after, the, diacid, from, which, they, can, be, derived, an, example, is, butanedial, which, is, also, called, succinaldehyde, from, succinic, acid, some, aldehydes, are, substrates, for, aldehyde, dehydrogenase, enzymes, which, metabolize, aldehydes, in, the, body, there, are, toxicities, associated, with, some, aldehydes, that, are, related, to, neurodegenerative, disease, heart, disease, and, some, types, of, cancer, of, all, aldehydes, formaldehyde, is, produced, on, the, largest, scale, about, 6, 000, 000, tons, per, year, it, is, mainly, used, in, the, production, of, resins, when, combined, with, urea, melamine, and, phenol, e, g, bakelite, it, is, a, precursor, to, methylene, diphenyl, diisocyanate, mdi, a, precursor, to, polyurethanes, the, second, main, aldehyde, is, butyraldehyde, of, which, about, 2, 500, 000, tons, per, year, are, prepared, by, hydroformylation, it, is, the, principal, precursor, to, 2, ethylhexanol, which, is, used, as, a, plasticizer, acetaldehyde, once, was, a, dominating, product, but, production, levels, have, declined, to, less, than, 1, 000, 000, tons, per, year, because, it, mainly, served, as, a, precursor, to, acetic, acid, which, is, now, prepared, by, carbonylation, of, methanol, many, other, aldehydes, find, commercial, applications, often, as, precursors, to, alcohols, the, so, called, oxo, alcohols, which, are, used, in, detergents, some, aldehydes, are, produced, only, on, a, small, scale, less, than, 1000, tons, per, year, and, are, used, as, ingredients, in, flavours, and, perfumes, such, as, chanel, no, 5, these, include, cinnamaldehyde, and, its, derivatives, citral, and, lilial, the, common, names, for, aldehydes, do, not, strictly, follow, official, guidelines, such, as, those, recommended, by, iupac, but, these, rules, are, useful, iupac, prescribes, the, following, nomenclature, for, aldehydes, the, word, aldehyde, was, coined, by, justus, von, liebig, as, a, contraction, of, the, latin, al, cohol, dehyd, rogenatus, dehydrogenated, alcohol, in, the, past, aldehydes, were, sometimes, named, after, the, corresponding, alcohols, for, example, vinous, aldehyde, for, acetaldehyde, vinous, is, from, latin, vinum, wine, the, traditional, source, of, ethanol, cognate, with, vinyl, the, term, formyl, group, is, derived, from, the, latin, word, formica, ant, this, word, can, be, recognized, in, the, simplest, aldehyde, formaldehyde, and, in, the, simplest, carboxylic, acid, formic, acid
