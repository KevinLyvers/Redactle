gold, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, au, from, latin, aurum, and, atomic, number, 79, in, its, pure, form, it, is, a, bright, slightly, orange, yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and, ductile, metal, chemically, gold, is, a, transition, metal, a, group, 11, element, and, one, of, the, noble, metals, it, is, one, of, the, least, reactive, chemical, elements, being, the, second, lowest, in, the, reactivity, series, it, is, solid, under, standard, conditions, gold, often, occurs, in, free, elemental, native, state, as, nuggets, or, grains, in, rocks, veins, and, alluvial, deposits, it, occurs, in, a, solid, solution, series, with, the, native, element, silver, as, in, electrum, naturally, alloyed, with, other, metals, like, copper, and, palladium, and, mineral, inclusions, such, as, within, pyrite, less, commonly, it, occurs, in, minerals, as, gold, compounds, often, with, tellurium, gold, tellurides, gold, is, resistant, to, most, acids, though, it, does, dissolve, in, aqua, regia, a, mixture, of, nitric, acid, and, hydrochloric, acid, forming, a, soluble, tetrachloroaurate, anion, gold, is, insoluble, in, nitric, acid, alone, which, dissolves, silver, and, base, metals, a, property, long, used, to, refine, gold, and, confirm, the, presence, of, gold, in, metallic, substances, giving, rise, to, the, term, acid, test, gold, dissolves, in, alkaline, solutions, of, cyanide, which, are, used, in, mining, and, electroplating, gold, also, dissolves, in, mercury, forming, amalgam, alloys, and, as, the, gold, acts, simply, as, a, solute, this, is, not, a, chemical, reaction, a, relatively, rare, element, gold, is, a, precious, metal, that, has, been, used, for, coinage, jewelry, and, other, works, of, art, throughout, recorded, history, in, the, past, a, gold, standard, was, often, implemented, as, a, monetary, policy, gold, coins, ceased, to, be, minted, as, a, circulating, currency, in, the, 1930s, and, the, world, gold, standard, was, abandoned, for, a, fiat, currency, system, after, the, nixon, shock, measures, of, 1971, in, 2020, the, world, s, largest, gold, producer, was, china, followed, by, russia, and, australia, as, of, 2020, a, total, of, around, 201, 296, tonnes, of, gold, exist, above, ground, this, is, equal, to, a, cube, with, each, side, measuring, roughly, 21, 7, meters, 71, ft, the, world, s, consumption, of, new, gold, produced, is, about, 50, in, jewelry, 40, in, investments, and, 10, in, industry, gold, s, high, malleability, ductility, resistance, to, corrosion, and, most, other, chemical, reactions, as, well, as, conductivity, of, electricity, have, led, to, its, continued, use, in, corrosion, resistant, electrical, connectors, in, all, types, of, computerized, devices, its, chief, industrial, use, gold, is, also, used, in, infrared, shielding, the, production, of, colored, glass, gold, leafing, and, tooth, restoration, certain, gold, salts, are, still, used, as, anti, inflammatory, agents, in, medicine, gold, is, the, most, malleable, of, all, metals, it, can, be, drawn, into, a, wire, of, single, atom, width, and, then, stretched, considerably, before, it, breaks, such, nanowires, distort, via, the, formation, reorientation, and, migration, of, dislocations, and, crystal, twins, without, noticeable, hardening, a, single, gram, of, gold, can, be, beaten, into, a, sheet, of, 1, square, metre, 11, sq, ft, and, an, avoirdupois, ounce, into, 28, square, metres, 300, sq, ft, gold, leaf, can, be, beaten, thin, enough, to, become, semi, transparent, the, transmitted, light, appears, greenish, blue, because, gold, strongly, reflects, yellow, and, red, such, semi, transparent, sheets, also, strongly, reflect, infrared, light, making, them, useful, as, infrared, radiant, heat, shields, in, the, visors, of, heat, resistant, suits, and, in, sun, visors, for, spacesuits, gold, is, a, good, conductor, of, heat, and, electricity, gold, has, a, density, of, 19, 3, g, cm, 3, almost, identical, to, that, of, tungsten, at, 19, 25, g, cm, 3, as, such, tungsten, has, been, used, in, the, counterfeiting, of, gold, bars, such, as, by, plating, a, tungsten, bar, with, gold, by, comparison, the, density, of, lead, is, 11, 34, g, cm, 3, and, that, of, the, densest, element, osmium, is, 22, 588, 0, 015, g, cm, 3, whereas, most, metals, are, gray, or, silvery, white, gold, is, slightly, reddish, yellow, this, color, is, determined, by, the, frequency, of, plasma, oscillations, among, the, metal, s, valence, electrons, in, the, ultraviolet, range, for, most, metals, but, in, the, visible, range, for, gold, due, to, relativistic, effects, affecting, the, orbitals, around, gold, atoms, similar, effects, impart, a, golden, hue, to, metallic, caesium, common, colored, gold, alloys, include, the, distinctive, eighteen, karat, rose, gold, created, by, the, addition, of, copper, alloys, containing, palladium, or, nickel, are, also, important, in, commercial, jewelry, as, these, produce, white, gold, alloys, fourteen, karat, gold, copper, alloy, is, nearly, identical, in, color, to, certain, bronze, alloys, and, both, may, be, used, to, produce, police, and, other, badges, fourteen, and, eighteen, karat, gold, alloys, with, silver, alone, appear, greenish, yellow, and, are, referred, to, as, green, gold, blue, gold, can, be, made, by, alloying, with, iron, and, purple, gold, can, be, made, by, alloying, with, aluminium, less, commonly, addition, of, manganese, indium, and, other, elements, can, produce, more, unusual, colors, of, gold, for, various, applications, colloidal, gold, used, by, electron, microscopists, is, red, if, the, particles, are, small, larger, particles, of, colloidal, gold, are, blue, gold, has, only, one, stable, isotope, 197, au, which, is, also, its, only, naturally, occurring, isotope, so, gold, is, both, a, mononuclidic, and, monoisotopic, element, thirty, six, radioisotopes, have, been, synthesized, ranging, in, atomic, mass, from, 169, to, 205, the, most, stable, of, these, is, 195, au, with, a, half, life, of, 186, 1, days, the, least, stable, is, 171, au, which, decays, by, proton, emission, with, a, half, life, of, 30, s, most, of, gold, s, radioisotopes, with, atomic, masses, below, 197, decay, by, some, combination, of, proton, emission, decay, and, decay, the, exceptions, are, 195, au, which, decays, by, electron, capture, and, 196, au, which, decays, most, often, by, electron, capture, 93, with, a, minor, decay, path, 7, all, of, gold, s, radioisotopes, with, atomic, masses, above, 197, decay, by, decay, at, least, 32, nuclear, isomers, have, also, been, characterized, ranging, in, atomic, mass, from, 170, to, 200, within, that, range, only, 178, au, 180, au, 181, au, 182, au, and, 188, au, do, not, have, isomers, gold, s, most, stable, isomer, is, 198m2, au, with, a, half, life, of, 2, 27, days, gold, s, least, stable, isomer, is, 177m2, au, with, a, half, life, of, only, 7, ns, 184m1, au, has, three, decay, paths, decay, isomeric, transition, and, alpha, decay, no, other, isomer, or, isotope, of, gold, has, three, decay, paths, the, possible, production, of, gold, from, a, more, common, element, such, as, lead, has, long, been, a, subject, of, human, inquiry, and, the, ancient, and, medieval, discipline, of, alchemy, often, focused, on, it, however, the, transmutation, of, the, chemical, elements, did, not, become, possible, until, the, understanding, of, nuclear, physics, in, the, 20th, century, the, first, synthesis, of, gold, was, conducted, by, japanese, physicist, hantaro, nagaoka, who, synthesized, gold, from, mercury, in, 1924, by, neutron, bombardment, an, american, team, working, without, knowledge, of, nagaoka, s, prior, study, conducted, the, same, experiment, in, 1941, achieving, the, same, result, and, showing, that, the, isotopes, of, gold, produced, by, it, were, all, radioactive, in, 1980, glenn, seaborg, transmuted, several, thousand, atoms, of, bismuth, into, gold, at, the, lawrence, berkeley, laboratory, gold, can, be, manufactured, in, a, nuclear, reactor, but, doing, so, is, highly, impractical, and, would, cost, far, more, than, the, value, of, the, gold, that, is, produced, although, gold, is, the, most, noble, of, the, noble, metals, it, still, forms, many, diverse, compounds, the, oxidation, state, of, gold, in, its, compounds, ranges, from, 1, to, 5, but, au, i, and, au, iii, dominate, its, chemistry, au, i, referred, to, as, the, aurous, ion, is, the, most, common, oxidation, state, with, soft, ligands, such, as, thioethers, thiolates, and, organophosphines, au, i, compounds, are, typically, linear, a, good, example, is, au, cn, 2, which, is, the, soluble, form, of, gold, encountered, in, mining, the, binary, gold, halides, such, as, aucl, form, zigzag, polymeric, chains, again, featuring, linear, coordination, at, au, most, drugs, based, on, gold, are, au, i, derivatives, au, iii, referred, to, as, auric, is, a, common, oxidation, state, and, is, illustrated, by, gold, iii, chloride, au, 2, cl, 6, the, gold, atom, centers, in, au, iii, complexes, like, other, d, 8, compounds, are, typically, square, planar, with, chemical, bonds, that, have, both, covalent, and, ionic, character, gold, i, iii, chloride, is, also, known, an, example, of, a, mixed, valence, complex, gold,

oxygen, is, present, to, form, soluble, complexes, common, oxidation, states, of, gold, include, 1, gold, i, or, aurous, compounds, and, 3, gold, iii, or, auric, compounds, gold, ions, in, solution, are, readily, reduced, and, precipitated, as, metal, by, adding, any, other, metal, as, the, reducing, agent, the, added, metal, is, oxidized, and, dissolves, allowing, the, gold, to, be, displaced, from, solution, and, be, recovered, as, a, solid, precipitate, less, common, oxidation, states, of, gold, include, 1, 2, and, 5, the, 1, oxidation, state, occurs, in, aurides, compounds, containing, the, au, anion, caesium, auride, csau, for, example, crystallizes, in, the, caesium, chloride, motif, rubidium, potassium, and, tetramethylammonium, aurides, are, also, known, gold, has, the, highest, electron, affinity, of, any, metal, at, 222, 8, kj, mol, making, au, a, stable, species, analogous, to, the, halides, gold, also, has, a, 1, oxidation, state, in, covalent, complexes, with, the, group, 4, transition, metals, such, as, in, titanium, tetraauride, and, the, analogous, zirconium, and, hafnium, compounds, these, chemicals, are, expected, to, form, gold, bridged, dimers, in, a,

normal, conditions, gold, pentafluoride, along, with, its, derivative, anion, auf, 6, and, its, difluorine, complex, gold, heptafluoride, is, the, sole, example, of, gold, v, the, highest, verified, oxidation, state, some, gold, compounds, exhibit, aurophilic, bonding, which, describes, the, tendency, of, gold, ions, to, interact, at, distances, that, are, too, long, to, be, a, conventional, au, au, bond, but, shorter, than, van, der, waals, bonding, the, interaction, is, estimated, to, be, comparable, in, strength, to, that, of, a, hydrogen, bond, well, defined, cluster, compounds, are, numerous, in, some, cases, gold, has, a, fractional, oxidation, state, a, representative, example, is, the, octahedral, species, au, p, c, 6, h, 5, 3, 2, 6, gold, is, thought, to, have, been, produced, in, supernova, nucleosynthesis, and, from, the, collision, of, neutron, stars, and, to, have, been, present, in, the, dust, from, which, the, solar, system, formed, traditionally, gold, in, the, universe, is, thought, to, have, formed, by, the, r, process, rapid, neutron, capture, in, supernova, nucleosynthesis, but, more, recently, it, has, been, suggested, that, gold, and, other, elements, heavier, than, iron, may, also, be, produced, in, quantity, by, the, r, process, in, the, collision, of, neutron, stars, in, both, cases, satellite, spectrometers, at, first, only, indirectly, detected, the, resulting, gold, however, in, august, 2017, the, spectroscopic, signatures, of, heavy, elements, including, gold, were, observed, by, electromagnetic, observatories, in, the, gw170817, neutron, star, merger, event, after, gravitational, wave, detectors, confirmed, the, event, as, a, neutron, star, merger, current, astrophysical, models, suggest, that, this, single, neutron, star, merger, event, generated, between, 3, and, 13, earth, masses, of, gold, this, amount, along, with, estimations, of, the, rate, of, occurrence, of, these, neutron, star, merger, events, suggests, that, such, mergers, may, produce, enough, gold, to, account, for, most, of, the, abundance, of, this, element, in, the, universe, because, the, earth, was, molten, when, it, was, formed, almost, all, of, the, gold, present, in, the, early, earth, probably, sank, into, the, planetary, core, therefore, as, hypothesized, in, one, model, most, of, the, gold, in, the, earth, s, crust, and, mantle, is, thought, to, have, been, delivered, to, earth, by, asteroid, impacts, during, the, late, heavy, bombardment, about, 4, billion, years, ago, gold, which, is, reachable, by, humans, has, in, one, case, been, associated, with, a, particular, asteroid, impact, the, asteroid, that, formed, vredefort, impact, structure, 2, 020, billion, years, ago, is, often, credited, with, seeding, the, witwatersrand, basin, in, south, africa, with, the, richest, gold, deposits, on, earth, however, this, scenario, is, now, questioned, the, gold, bearing, witwatersrand, rocks, were, laid, down, between, 700, and, 950, million, years, before, the, vredefort, impact, these, gold, bearing, rocks, had, furthermore, been, covered, by, a, thick, layer, of, ventersdorp, lavas, and, the, transvaal, supergroup, of, rocks, before, the, meteor, struck, and, thus, the, gold, did, not, actually, arrive, in, the, asteroid, meteorite, what, the, vredefort, impact, achieved, however, was, to, distort, the, witwatersrand, basin, in, such, a, way, that, the, gold, bearing, rocks, were, brought, to, the, present, erosion, surface, in, johannesburg, on, the, witwatersrand, just, inside, the, rim, of, the, original, 300, km, 190, mi, diameter, crater, caused, by, the, meteor, strike, the, discovery, of, the, deposit, in, 1886, launched, the, witwatersrand, gold, rush, some, 22, of, all, the, gold, that, is, ascertained, to, exist, today, on, earth, has, been, extracted, from, these, witwatersrand, rocks, much, of, the, rest, of, the, gold, on, earth, is, thought, to, have, been, incorporated, into, the, planet, since, its, very, beginning, as, planetesimals, formed, the, mantle, in, 2017, an, international, group, of, scientists, established, that, gold, came, to, the, earth, s, surface, from, the, deepest, regions, of, our, planet, the, mantle, as, evidenced, by, their, findings, at, deseado, massif, in, the, argentinian, patagonia, on, earth, gold, is, found, in, ores, in, rock, formed, from, the, precambrian, time, onward, it, most, often, occurs, as, a, native, metal, typically, in, a, metal, solid, solution, with, silver, i, e, as, a, gold, silver, alloy, such, alloys, usually, have, a, silver, content, of, 8, 10, electrum, is, elemental, gold, with, more, than, 20, silver, and, is, commonly, known, as, white, gold, electrum, s, color, runs, from, golden, silvery, to, silvery, dependent, upon, the, silver, content, the, more, silver, the, lower, the, specific, gravity, native, gold, occurs, as, very, small, to, microscopic, particles, embedded, in, rock, often, together, with, quartz, or, sulfide, minerals, such, as, fool, s, gold, which, is, a, pyrite, these, are, called, lode, deposits, the, metal, in, a, native, state, is, also, found, in, the, form, of, free, flakes, grains, or, larger, nuggets, that, have, been, eroded, from, rocks, and, end, up, in, alluvial, deposits, called, placer, deposits, such, free, gold, is, always, richer, at, the, exposed, surface, of, gold, bearing, veins, owing, to, the, oxidation, of, accompanying, minerals, followed, by, weathering, and, by, washing, of, the, dust, into, streams, and, rivers, where, it, collects, and, can, be, welded, by, water, action, to, form, nuggets, gold, sometimes, occurs, combined, with, tellurium, as, the, minerals, calaverite, krennerite, nagyagite, petzite, and, sylvanite, see, telluride, minerals, and, as, the, rare, bismuthide, maldonite, au, 2, bi, and, antimonide, aurostibite, ausb, 2, gold, also, occurs, in, rare, alloys, with, copper, lead, and, mercury, the, minerals, auricupride, cu, 3, au, novodneprite, aupb, 3, and, weishanite, au, ag, 3, hg, 2, a, 2004, research, paper, suggests, that, microbes, can, sometimes, play, an, important, role, in, forming, gold, deposits, transporting, and, precipitating, gold, to, form, grains, and, nuggets, that, collect, in, alluvial, deposits, a, 2013, study, has, claimed, water, in, faults, vaporizes, during, an, earthquake, depositing, gold, when, an, earthquake, strikes, it, moves, along, a, fault, water, often, lubricates, faults, filling, in, fractures, and, jogs, about, 10, kilometres, 6, 2, mi, below, the, surface, under, very, high, temperatures, and, pressures, the, water, carries, high, concentrations, of, carbon, dioxide, silica, and, gold, during, an, earthquake, the, fault, jog, suddenly, opens, wider, the, water, inside, the, void, instantly, vaporizes, flashing, to, steam, and, forcing, silica, which, forms, the, mineral, quartz, and, gold, out, of, the, fluids, and, onto, nearby, surfaces, the, world, s, oceans, contain, gold, measured, concentrations, of, gold, in, the, atlantic, and, northeast, pacific, are, 50, 150, femtomol, l, or, 10, 30, parts, per, quadrillion, about, 10, 30, g, km, 3, in, general, gold, concentrations, for, south, atlantic, and, central, pacific, samples, are, the, same, 50, femtomol, l, but, less, certain, mediterranean, deep, waters, contain, slightly, higher, concentrations, of, gold, 100, 150, femtomol, l, which, is, attributed, to, wind, blown, dust, or, rivers, at, 10, parts, per, quadrillion, the, earth, s, oceans, would, hold, 15, 000, tonnes, of, gold, these, figures, are, three, orders, of, magnitude, less, than, reported, in, the, literature, prior, to, 1988, indicating, contamination, problems, with, the, earlier, data, a, number, of, people, have, claimed, to, be, able, to, economically, recover, gold, from, sea, water, but, they, were, either, mistaken, or, acted, in, an, intentional, deception, prescott, jernegan, ran, a, gold, from, seawater, swindle, in, the, united, states, in, the, 1890s, as, did, an, english, fraudster, in, the, early, 1900s, fritz, haber, did, research, on, the, extraction, of, gold, from, sea, water, in, an, effort, to, help, pay, germany, s, reparations, following, world, war, i, based, on, the, published, values, of, 2, to, 64, ppb, of, gold, in, seawater, a, commercially, successful, extraction, seemed, possible, after, analysis, of, 4, 000, water, samples, yielding, an, average, of, 0, 004, ppb, it, became, clear, that, extraction, would, not, be, possible, and, he, ended, the, project, the, earliest, recorded, metal, employed, by, humans, appears, to, be, gold, which, can, be, found, free, or, native, small, amounts, of, natural, gold, have, been, found, in, spanish, caves, used, during, the, late, paleolithic, period, c, 40, 000, bc, the, oldest, gold, artifacts, in, the, world, are, from, bulgaria, and, are, dating, back, to, the, 5th, millennium, bc, 4, 600, bc, to, 4, 200, bc, such, as, those, found, in, the, varna, necropolis, near, lake, varna, and, the, black, sea, coast, thought, to, be, the, earliest, well, dated, finding, of, gold, artifacts, in, history, several, prehistoric, bulgarian, finds, are, considered, no, less, old, the, golden, treasures, of, hotnitsa, durankulak, artifacts, from, the, kurgan, settlement, of, yunatsite, near, pazardzhik, the, golden, treasure, sakar, as, well, as, beads, and, gold, jewelry, found, in, the, kurgan, settlement, of, provadia, solnitsata, salt, pit, however, varna, gold, is, most, often, called, the, oldest, since, this, treasure, is, the, largest, and, most, diverse, gold, artifacts, probably, made, their, first, appearance, in, ancient, egypt, at, the, very, beginning, of, the, pre, dynastic, period, at, the, end, of, the, fifth, millennium, bc, and, the, start, of, the, fourth, and, smelting, was, developed, during, the, course, of, the, 4th, millennium, gold, artifacts, appear, in, the, archeology, of, lower, mesopotamia, during, the, early, 4th, millennium, as, of, 1990, gold, artifacts, found, at, the, wadi, qana, cave, cemetery, of, the, 4th, millennium, bc, in, west, bank, were, the, earliest, from, the, levant, gold, artifacts, such, as, the, golden, hats, and, the, nebra, disk, appeared, in, central, europe, from, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, bronze, age, the, oldest, known, map, of, a, gold, mine, was, drawn, in, the, 19th, dynasty, of, ancient, egypt, 1320, 1200, bc, whereas, the, first, written, reference, to, gold, was, recorded, in, the, 12th, dynasty, around, 1900, bc, egyptian, hieroglyphs, from, as, early, as, 2600, bc, describe, gold, which, king, tushratta, of, the, mitanni, claimed, was, more, plentiful, than, dirt, in, egypt, egypt, and, especially, nubia, had, the, resources, to, make, them, major, gold, producing, areas, for, much, of, history, one, of, the, earliest, known, maps, known, as, the, turin, papyrus, map, shows, the, plan, of, a, gold, mine, in, nubia, together, with, indications, of, the, local, geology, the, primitive, working, methods, are, described, by, both, strabo, and, diodorus, siculus, and, included, fire, setting, large, mines, were, also, present, across, the, red, sea, in, what, is, now, saudi, arabia, gold, is, mentioned, in, the, amarna, letters, numbered, 19, and, 26, from, around, the, 14th, century, bc, gold, is, mentioned, frequently, in, the, old, testament, starting, with, genesis, 2, 11, at, havilah, the, story, of, the, golden, calf, and, many, parts, of, the, temple, including, the, menorah, and, the, golden, altar, in, the, new, testament, it, is, included, with, the, gifts, of, the, magi, in, the, first, chapters, of, matthew, the, book, of, revelation, 21, 21, describes, the, city, of, new, jerusalem, as, having, streets, made, of, pure, gold, clear, as, crystal, exploitation, of, gold, in, the, south, east, corner, of, the, black, sea, is, said, to, date, from, the, time, of, midas, and, this, gold, was, important, in, the, establishment, of, what, is, probably, the, world, s, earliest, coinage, in, lydia, around, 610, bc, the, legend, of, the, golden, fleece, dating, from, eighth, century, bce, may, refer, to, the, use, of, fleeces, to, trap, gold, dust, from, placer, deposits, in, the, ancient, world, from, the, 6th, or, 5th, century, bc, the, chu, state, circulated, the, ying, yuan, one, kind, of, square, gold, coin, in, roman, metallurgy, new, methods, for, extracting, gold, on, a, large, scale, were, developed, by, introducing, hydraulic, mining, methods, especially, in, hispania, from, 25, bc, onwards, and, in, dacia, from, 106, ad, onwards, one, of, their, largest, mines, was, at, las, medulas, in, le, n, where, seven, long, aqueducts, enabled, them, to, sluice, most, of, a, large, alluvial, deposit, the, mines, at, ro, ia, montan, in, transylvania, were, also, very, large, and, until, very, recently, still, mined, by, opencast, methods, they, also, exploited, smaller, deposits, in, britain, such, as, placer, and, hard, rock, deposits, at, dolaucothi, the, various, methods, they, used, are, well, described, by, pliny, the, elder, in, his, encyclopedia, naturalis, historia, written, towards, the, end, of, the, first, century, ad, during, mansa, musa, s, ruler, of, the, mali, empire, from, 1312, to, 1337, hajj, to, mecca, in, 1324, he, passed, through, cairo, in, july, 1324, and, was, reportedly, accompanied, by, a, camel, train, that, included, thousands, of, people, and, nearly, a, hundred, camels, where, he, gave, away, so, much, gold, that, it, depressed, the, price, in, egypt, for, over, a, decade, causing, high, inflation, a, contemporary, arab, historian, remarked, gold, was, at, a, high, price, in, egypt, until, they, came, in, that, year, the, mithqal, did, not, go, below, 25, dirhams, and, was, generally, above, but, from, that, time, its, value, fell, and, it, cheapened, in, price, and, has, remained, cheap, till, now, the, mithqal, does, not, exceed, 22, dirhams, or, less, this, has, been, the, state, of, affairs, for, about, twelve, years, until, this, day, by, reason, of, the, large, amount, of, gold, which, they, brought, into, egypt, and, spent, there, the, european, exploration, of, the, americas, was, fueled, in, no, small, part, by, reports, of, the, gold, ornaments, displayed, in, great, profusion, by, native, american, peoples, especially, in, mesoamerica, peru, ecuador, and, colombia, the, aztecs, regarded, gold, as, the, product, of, the, gods, calling, it, literally, god, excrement, teocuitlatl, in, nahuatl, and, after, moctezuma, ii, was, killed, most, of, this, gold, was, shipped, to, spain, however, for, the, indigenous, peoples, of, north, america, gold, was, considered, useless, and, they, saw, much, greater, value, in, other, minerals, which, were, directly, related, to, their, utility, such, as, obsidian, flint, and, slate, el, dorado, is, applied, to, a, legendary, story, in, which, precious, stones, were, found, in, fabulous, abundance, along, with, gold, coins, the, concept, of, el, dorado, underwent, several, transformations, and, eventually, accounts, of, the, previous, myth, were, also, combined, with, those, of, a, legendary, lost, city, el, dorado, was, the, term, used, by, the, spanish, empire, to, describe, a, mythical, tribal, chief, zipa, of, the, muisca, native, people, in, colombia, who, as, an, initiation, rite, covered, himself, with, gold, dust, and, submerged, in, lake, guatavita, the, legends, surrounding, el, dorado, changed, over, time, as, it, went, from, being, a, man, to, a, city, to, a, kingdom, and, then, finally, to, an, empire, beginning, in, the, early, modern, period, european, exploration, and, colonization, of, west, africa, was, driven, in, large, part, by, reports, of, gold, deposits, in, the, region, which, was, eventually, referred, to, by, europeans, as, the, gold, coast, from, the, late, 15th, to, early, 19th, centuries, european, trade, in, the, region, was, primarily, focused, in, gold, along, with, ivory, and, slaves, the, gold, trade, in, west, africa, was, dominated, by, the, ashanti, empire, who, initially, traded, with, the, portuguese, before, branching, out, and, trading, with, british, french, spanish, and, danish, merchants, british, desires, to, secure, control, of, west, african, gold, deposits, played, a, role, in, the, anglo, ashanti, wars, of, the, late, 19th, century, which, saw, the, ashanti, empire, annexed, by, britain, gold, played, a, role, in, western, culture, as, a, cause, for, desire, and, of, corruption, as, told, in, children, s, fables, such, as, rumpelstiltskin, where, rumpelstiltskin, turns, hay, into, gold, for, the, peasant, s, daughter, in, return, for, her, child, when, she, becomes, a, princess, and, the, stealing, of, the, hen, that, lays, golden, eggs, in, jack, and, the, beanstalk, the, top,

one, main, goal, of, the, alchemists, was, to, produce, gold, from, other, substances, such, as, lead, presumably, by, the, interaction, with, a, mythical, substance, called, the, philosopher, s, stone, trying, to, produce, gold, led, the, alchemists, to, systematically, find, out, what, can, be, done, with, substances, and, this, laid, the, foundation, for, today, s, chemistry, which, can, produce, gold, albeit, uneconomically, by, using, nuclear, transmutation, their, symbol, for, gold, was, the, circle, with, a, point, at, its, center, which, was, also, the, astrological, symbol, and, the, ancient, chinese, character, for, the, sun, the, dome, of, the, rock, is, covered, with, an, ultra, thin, golden, glassier, the, sikh, golden, temple, the, harmandir, sahib, is, a, building,

and, argentina, it, has, been, estimated, that, up, to, one, quarter, of, the, yearly, global, gold, production, originates, from, artisanal, or, small, scale, mining, the, city, of, johannesburg, located, in, south, africa, was, founded, as, a, result, of, the, witwatersrand, gold, rush, which, resulted, in, the, discovery, of, some, of, the, largest, natural, gold, deposits, in, recorded, history, the, gold, fields, are, confined, to, the, northern, and, north, western, edges, of, the, witwatersrand, basin, which, is, a, 5, 7, km, 3, 1, 4, 3, mi, thick, layer, of, archean, rocks, located, in, most, places, deep, under, the, free, state, gauteng, and, surrounding, provinces, these, witwatersrand, rocks, are, exposed, at, the, surface, on, the, witwatersrand, in, and, around, johannesburg, but, also, in, isolated, patches, to, the, south, east, and, south, west, of, johannesburg, as, well, as, in, an, arc, around, the, vredefort, dome, which, lies, close, to, the, center, of, the, witwatersrand, basin, from, these, surface, exposures, the, basin, dips, extensively, requiring, some, of, the, mining, to, occur, at, depths, of, nearly, 4, 000, m, 13, 000, ft, making, them, especially, the, savuka, and, tautona, mines, to, the, south, west, of, johannesburg, the, deepest, mines, on, earth, the, gold, is, found, only, in, six, areas, where, archean, rivers, from, the, north, and, north, west, formed, extensive, pebbly, braided, river, deltas, before, draining, into, the, witwatersrand, sea, where, the, rest, of, the, witwatersrand, sediments, were, deposited, the, second, boer, war, of, 1899, 1901, between, the, british, empire, and, the, afrikaner, boers, was, at, least, partly, over, the, rights, of, miners, and, possession, of, the, gold, wealth, in, south, africa, during, the, 19th, century, gold, rushes, occurred, whenever, large, gold, deposits, were, discovered, the, first, documented, discovery, of, gold, in, the, united, states, was, at, the, reed, gold, mine, near, georgeville, north, carolina, in, 1803, the, first, major, gold, strike, in, the, united, states, occurred, in, a, small, north, georgia, town, called, dahlonega, further, gold, rushes, occurred, in, california, colorado, the, black, hills, otago, in, new, zealand, a, number, of, locations, across, australia, witwatersrand, in, south, africa, and, the, klondike, in, canada, grasberg, mine, located, in, papua, indonesia, is, the, largest, gold, mine, in, the, world, gold, extraction, is, most, economical, in, large, easily, mined, deposits, ore, grades, as, little, as, 0, 5, parts, per, million, ppm, can, be, economical, typical, ore, grades, in, open, pit, mines, are, 1, 5, ppm, ore, grades, in, underground, or, hard, rock, mines, are, usually, at, least, 3, ppm, because, ore, grades, of, 30, ppm, are, usually, needed, before, gold, is, visible, to, the, naked, eye, in, most, gold, mines, the, gold, is, invisible, the, average, gold, mining, and, extraction, costs, were, about, 317, per, troy, ounce, in, 2007, but, these, can, vary, widely, depending, on, mining, type, and, ore, quality, global, mine, production, amounted, to, 2, 471, 1,

british, gold, sovereign, continue, to, be, minted, in, 22k, 0, 92, metal, in, historical, tradition, and, the, south, african, krugerrand, first, released, in, 1967, is, also, 22k, 0, 92, the, special, issue, canadian, gold, maple, leaf, coin, contains, the, highest, purity, gold, of, any, bullion, coin, at, 99, 999, or, 0, 99999, while, the, popular, issue, canadian, gold, maple, leaf, coin, has, a, purity, of, 99, 99, in, 2006, the, united, states, mint, began, producing, the, american, buffalo, gold, bullion, coin, with, a, purity, of, 99, 99, the, australian, gold, kangaroos, were, first, coined, in, 1986, as, the, australian, gold, nugget, but, changed, the, reverse, design, in, 1989, other, modern, coins, include, the, austrian, vienna, philharmonic, bullion, coin, and, the, chinese, gold, panda, like, other, precious, metals, gold, is, measured, by, troy, weight, and, by, grams, the, proportion, of, gold, in, the, alloy, is, measured, by, karat, k, with, 24, karat, 24k, being, pure, gold, 100, and, lower, karat, numbers, proportionally, less, 18k, 75, the, purity, of, a, gold, bar, or, coin, can, also, be, expressed, as, a, decimal, figure, ranging, from, 0, to, 1, known, as, the, millesimal, fineness, such, as, 0, 995, being, nearly, pure, the, price, of, gold, is, determined, through, trading, in, the, gold, and, derivatives, markets, but, a, procedure, known, as, the, gold, fixing, in, london, originating, in, september, 1919, provides, a, daily, benchmark, price, to, the, industry, the, afternoon, fixing, was, introduced, in, 1968, to, provide, a, price, when, us, markets, are, open, as, of, september, 2017, gold, was, valued, at, around, 42, per, gram, 1, 300, per, troy, ounce, historically, gold, coinage, was, widely, used, as, currency, when, paper, money, was, introduced, it, typically, was, a, receipt, redeemable, for, gold, coin, or, bullion, in, a, monetary, system, known, as, the, gold, standard, a, certain, weight, of, gold, was, given, the, name, of, a, unit, of, currency, for, a, long, period, the, united, states, government, set, the, value, of, the, us, dollar, so, that, one, troy, ounce, was, equal, to, 20, 67, 0, 665, per, gram, but, in, 1934, the, dollar, was, devalued, to, 35, 00, per, troy, ounce, 0, 889, g, by, 1961, it, was, becoming, hard, to, maintain, this, price, and, a, pool, of, us, and, european, banks, agreed, to, manipulate, the, market, to, prevent, further, currency, devaluation, against, increased, gold, demand, the, largest, gold, depository, in, the, world, is, that, of, the, u, s, federal, reserve, bank, in, new, york, which, holds, about, 3, of, the, gold, known, to, exist, and, accounted, for, today, as, does, the, similarly, laden, u, s, bullion, depository, at, fort, knox, in, 2005, the, world, gold, council, estimated, total, global, gold, supply, to, be, 3, 859, tonnes, and, demand, to, be, 3, 754, tonnes, giving, a, surplus, of, 105, tonnes, after, 15, august, 1971, nixon, shock, the, price, began, to, greatly, increase, and, between, 1968, and, 2000, the, price, of, gold, ranged, widely, from, a, high, of, 850, per, troy, ounce, 27, 33, g, on, 21, january, 1980, to, a, low, of, 252, 90, per, troy, ounce, 8, 13, g, on, 21, june, 1999, london, gold, fixing, prices, increased, rapidly, from, 2001, but, the, 1980, high, was, not, exceeded, until, 3, january, 2008, when, a, new, maximum, of, 865, 35, per, troy, ounce, was, set, another, record, price, was, set, on, 17, march, 2008, at, 1023, 50, per, troy, ounce, 32, 91, g, on, 2, december, 2009, gold, reached, a, new, high, closing, at, 1, 217, 23, gold, further, rallied, hitting, new, highs, in, may, 2010, after, the, european, union, debt, crisis, prompted, further, purchase, of, gold, as, a, safe, asset, on, 1, march, 2011, gold, hit, a, new, all, time, high, of, 1432, 57, based, on, investor, concerns, regarding, ongoing, unrest, in, north, africa, as, well, as, in, the, middle, east, from, april, 2001, to, august, 2011, spot, gold, prices, more, than, quintupled, in, value, against, the, us, dollar, hitting, a, new, all, time, high, of, 1, 913, 50, on, 23, august, 2011, prompting, speculation, that, the, long, secular, bear, market, had, ended, and, a, bull, market, had, returned, however, the, price, then, began, a, slow, decline, towards, 1200, per, troy, ounce, in, late, 2014, and, 2015, in, august, 2020, the, gold, price, picked, up, to, us, 2060, per, ounce, after, a, total, growth, of, 59, from, august, 2018, to, october, 2020, a, period, during, which, it, outplaced, the, nasdaq, total, return, of, 54, gold, futures, are, traded, on, the, comex, exchange, these, contacts, are, priced, in, usd, per, troy, ounce, 1, troy, ounce, 31, 1034768, grams, below, are, the, cqg, contract, specifications, outlining, the, futures, contracts, because, of, the, softness, of, pure, 24k, gold, it, is, usually, alloyed, with, other, metals, for, use, in, jewelry, altering, its, hardness, and, ductility, melting, point, color, and, other, properties, alloys, with, lower, karat, rating, typically, 22k, 18k, 14k, or, 10k, contain, higher, percentages, of, copper, silver, palladium, or, other, base, metals, in, the, alloy, nickel, is, toxic, and, its, release, from, nickel, white, gold, is, controlled, by, legislation, in, europe, palladium, gold, alloys, are, more, expensive, than, those, using, nickel, high, karat, white, gold, alloys, are, more, resistant, to, corrosion, than, are, either, pure, silver, or, sterling, silver, the, japanese, craft, of, mokume, gane, exploits, the, color, contrasts, between, laminated, colored, gold, alloys, to, produce, decorative, wood, grain, effects, by, 2014, the, gold, jewelry, industry, was, escalating, despite, a, dip, in, gold, prices, demand, in, the, first, quarter, of, 2014, pushed, turnover, to, 23, 7, billion, according, to, a, world, gold, council, report, gold, solder, is, used, for, joining, the, components, of, gold, jewelry, by, high, temperature, hard, soldering, or, brazing, if, the, work, is, to, be, of, hallmarking, quality, the, gold, solder, alloy, must, match, the, fineness, of, the, work, and, alloy, formulas, are, manufactured, to, color, match, yellow, and, white, gold, gold, solder, is, usually, made, in, at, least, three, melting, point, ranges, referred, to, as, easy, medium, and, hard, by, using, the, hard, high, melting, point, solder, first, followed, by, solders, with, progressively, lower, melting, points, goldsmiths, can, assemble, complex, items, with, several, separate, soldered, joints, gold, can, also, be, made, into, thread, and, used, in, embroidery, only, 10, of, the, world, consumption, of, new, gold, produced, goes, to, industry, but, by, far, the, most, important, industrial, use, for, new, gold, is, in, fabrication, of, corrosion, free, electrical, connectors, in, computers, and, other, electrical, devices, for, example, according, to, the, world, gold, council, a, typical, cell, phone, may, contain, 50, mg, of, gold, worth, about, three, dollars, but, since, nearly, one, billion, cell, phones, are, produced, each, year, a, gold, value, of, us, 2, 82, in, each, phone, adds, to, us, 2, 82, billion, in, gold, from, just, this, application, prices, updated, to, november, 2022, though, gold, is, attacked, by, free, chlorine, its, good, conductivity, and, general, resistance, to, oxidation, and, corrosion, in, other, environments, including, resistance, to, non, chlorinated, acids, has, led, to, its, widespread, industrial, use, in, the, electronic, era, as, a, thin, layer, coating, on, electrical, connectors, thereby, ensuring, good, connection, for, example, gold, is, used, in, the, connectors, of, the, more, expensive, electronics, cables, such, as, audio, video, and, usb, cables, the, benefit, of, using, gold, over, other, connector, metals, such, as, tin, in, these, applications, has, been, debated, gold, connectors, are, often, criticized, by, audio, visual, experts, as, unnecessary, for, most, consumers, and, seen, as, simply, a, marketing, ploy, however, the, use, of, gold, in, other, applications, in, electronic, sliding, contacts, in, highly, humid, or, corrosive, atmospheres, and, in, use, for, contacts, with, a, very, high, failure, cost, certain, computers, communications, equipment, spacecraft, jet, aircraft, engines, remains, very, common, besides, sliding, electrical, contacts, gold, is, also, used, in, electrical, contacts, because, of, its, resistance, to, corrosion, electrical, conductivity, ductility, and, lack, of, toxicity, switch, contacts, are, generally, subjected, to, more, intense, corrosion, stress, than, are, sliding, contacts, fine, gold, wires, are, used, to, connect, semiconductor, devices, to, their, packages, through, a, process, known, as, wire, bonding, the, concentration, of, free, electrons, in, gold, metal, is, 5, 91, 10, 22, cm, 3, gold, is, highly, conductive, to, electricity, and, has, been, used, for, electrical, wiring, in, some, high, energy, applications, only, silver, and, copper, are, more, conductive, per, volume, but, gold, has, the, advantage, of, corrosion, resistance, for, example, gold, electrical, wires, were, used, during, some, of, the, manhattan, project, s, atomic, experiments, but, large, high, current, silver, wires, were, used, in, the, calutron, isotope, separator, magnets, in, the, project, it, is, estimated, that, 16, of, the, world, s, presently, accounted, for, gold, and, 22, of, the, world, s, silver, is, contained, in, electronic, technology, in, japan, metallic, and, gold, compounds, have, long, been, used, for, medicinal, purposes, gold, usually, as, the, metal, is, perhaps, the, most, anciently, administered, medicine, apparently, by, shamanic, practitioners, and, known, to, dioscorides, in, medieval, times, gold, was, often, seen, as, beneficial, for, the, health, in, the, belief, that, something, so, rare, and, beautiful, could, not, be, anything, but, healthy, even, some, modern, esotericists, and, forms, of, alternative, medicine, assign, metallic, gold, a, healing, power, in, the, 19th, century, gold, had, a, reputation, as, an, anxiolytic, a, therapy, for, nervous, disorders, depression, epilepsy, migraine, and, glandular, problems, such, as, amenorrhea, and, impotence, were, treated, and, most, notably, alcoholism, keeley, 1897, the, apparent, paradox, of, the, actual, toxicology, of, the, substance, suggests, the, possibility, of, serious, gaps, in, the, understanding, of, the, action, of, gold, in, physiology, only, salts, and, radioisotopes, of, gold, are, of, pharmacological, value, since, elemental, metallic, gold, is, inert, to, all, chemicals, it, encounters, inside, the, body, e, g, ingested, gold, cannot, be, attacked, by, stomach, acid, some, gold, salts, do, have, anti, inflammatory, properties, and, at, present, two, are, still, used, as, pharmaceuticals, in, the, treatment, of, arthritis, and, other, similar, conditions, in, the, us, sodium, aurothiomalate, and, auranofin, these, drugs, have, been, explored, as, a, means, to, help, to, reduce, the, pain, and, swelling, of, rheumatoid, arthritis, and, also, historically, against, tuberculosis, and, some, parasites, gold, alloys, are, used, in, restorative, dentistry, especially, in, tooth, restorations, such, as, crowns, and, permanent, bridges, the, gold, alloys, slight, malleability, facilitates, the, creation, of, a, superior, molar, mating, surface, with, other, teeth, and, produces, results, that, are, generally, more, satisfactory, than, those, produced, by, the, creation, of, porcelain, crowns, the, use, of, gold, crowns, in, more, prominent, teeth, such, as, incisors, is, favored, in, some, cultures, and, discouraged, in, others, colloidal, gold, preparations, suspensions, of, gold, nanoparticles, in, water, are, intensely, red, colored, and, can, be, made, with, tightly, controlled, particle, sizes, up, to, a, few, tens, of, nanometers, across, by, reduction, of, gold, chloride, with, citrate, or, ascorbate, ions, colloidal, gold, is, used, in, research, applications, in, medicine, biology, and, materials, science, the, technique, of, immunogold, labeling, exploits, the, ability, of, the, gold, particles, to, adsorb, protein, molecules, onto, their, surfaces, colloidal, gold, particles, coated, with, specific, antibodies, can, be, used, as, probes, for, the, presence, and, position, of, antigens, on, the, surfaces, of, cells, in, ultrathin, sections, of, tissues, viewed, by, electron, microscopy, the, immunogold, labels, appear, as, extremely, dense, round, spots, at, the, position, of, the, antigen, gold, or, alloys, of, gold, and, palladium, are, applied, as, conductive, coating, to, biological, specimens, and, other, non, conducting, materials, such, as, plastics, and, glass, to, be, viewed, in, a, scanning, electron, microscope, the, coating, which, is, usually, applied, by, sputtering, with, an, argon, plasma, has, a, triple, role, in, this, application, gold, s, very, high, electrical, conductivity, drains, electrical, charge, to, earth, and, its, very, high, density, provides, stopping, power, for, electrons, in, the, electron, beam, helping, to, limit, the, depth, to, which, the, electron, beam, penetrates, the, specimen, this, improves, definition, of, the, position, and, topography, of, the, specimen, surface, and, increases, the, spatial, resolution, of, the, image, gold, also, produces, a, high, output, of, secondary, electrons, when, irradiated, by, an, electron, beam, and, these, low, energy, electrons, are, the, most, commonly, used, signal, source, used, in, the, scanning, electron, microscope, the, isotope, gold, 198, half, life, 2, 7, days, is, used, in, nuclear, medicine, in, some, cancer, treatments, and, for, treating, other, diseases, pure, metallic, elemental, gold, is, non, toxic, and, non, irritating, when, ingested, and, is, sometimes, used, as, a, food, decoration, in, the, form, of, gold, leaf, metallic, gold, is, also, a, component, of, the, alcoholic, drinks, goldschl, ger, gold, strike, and, goldwasser, metallic, gold, is, approved, as, a, food, additive, in, the, eu, e175, in, the, codex, alimentarius, although, the, gold, ion, is, toxic, the, acceptance, of, metallic, gold, as, a, food, additive, is, due, to, its, relative, chemical, inertness, and, resistance, to, being, corroded, or, transformed, into, soluble, salts, gold, compounds, by, any, known, chemical, process, which, would, be, encountered, in, the, human, body, soluble, compounds, gold, salts, such, as,
