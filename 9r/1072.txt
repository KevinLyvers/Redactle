temperature, is, a, physical, quantity, that, quantitatively, expresses, the, attribute, of, hotness, or, coldness, temperature, is, measured, with, a, thermometer, it, reflects, the, average, kinetic, energy, of, the, vibrating, and, colliding, atoms, making, up, a, substance, thermometers, are, calibrated, in, various, temperature, scales, that, historically, have, relied, on, various, reference, points, and, thermometric, substances, for, definition, the, most, common, scales, are, the, celsius, scale, with, the, unit, symbol, c, formerly, called, centigrade, the, fahrenheit, scale, f, and, the, kelvin, scale, k, the, latter, being, used, predominantly, for, scientific, purposes, the, kelvin, is, one, of, the, seven, base, units, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, absolute, zero, i, e, zero, kelvin, or, 273, 15, c, is, the, lowest, point, in, the, thermodynamic, temperature, scale, experimentally, it, can, be, approached, very, closely, but, not, actually, reached, as, recognized, in, the, third, law, of, thermodynamics, it, would, be, impossible, to, extract, energy, as, heat, from, a, body, at, that, temperature, temperature, is, important, in, all, fields, of, natural, science, including, physics, chemistry, earth, science, astronomy, medicine, biology, ecology, material, science, metallurgy, mechanical, engineering, and, geography, as, well, as, most, aspects, of, daily, life, many, physical, processes, are, related, to, temperature, some, of, them, are, given, below, temperature, scales, need, two, values, for, definition, the, point, chosen, as, zero, degrees, and, the, magnitudes, of, the, incremental, unit, of, temperature, the, celsius, scale, c, is, used, for, common, temperature, measurements, in, most, of, the, world, it, is, an, empirical, scale, that, developed, historically, which, led, to, its, zero, point, 0, c, being, defined, as, the, freezing, point, of, water, and, 100, c, as, the, boiling, point, of, water, both, at, atmospheric, pressure, at, sea, level, it, was, called, a, centigrade, scale, because, of, the, 100, degree, interval, since, the, standardization, of, the, kelvin, in, the, international, system, of, units, it, has, subsequently, been, redefined, in, terms, of, the, equivalent, fixing, points, on, the, kelvin, scale, so, that, a, temperature, increment, of, one, degree, celsius, is, the, same, as, an, increment, of, one, kelvin, though, numerically, the, scales, differ, by, an, exact, offset, of, 273, 15, the, fahrenheit, scale, is, in, common, use, in, the, united, states, water, freezes, at, 32, f, and, boils, at, 212, f, at, sea, level, atmospheric, pressure, at, the, absolute, zero, of, temperature, no, energy, can, be, removed, from, matter, as, heat, a, fact, expressed, in, the, third, law, of, thermodynamics, at, this, temperature, matter, contains, no, macroscopic, thermal, energy, but, still, has, quantum, mechanical, zero, point, energy, as, predicted, by, the, uncertainty, principle, although, this, does, not, enter, into, the, definition, of, absolute, temperature, experimentally, absolute, zero, can, be, approached, only, very, closely, it, can, never, be, reached, the, lowest, temperature, attained, by, experiment, is, 38, pk, theoretically, in, a, body, at, a, temperature, of, absolute, zero, all, classical, motion, of, its, particles, has, ceased, and, they, are, at, complete, rest, in, this, classical, sense, absolute, zero, defined, as, 0, k, is, exactly, equal, to, 273, 15, c, or, 459, 67, f, referring, to, the, boltzmann, constant, to, the, maxwell, boltzmann, distribution, and, to, the, boltzmann, statistical, mechanical, definition, of, entropy, as, distinct, from, the, gibbs, definition, for, independently, moving, microscopic, particles, disregarding, interparticle, potential, energy, by, international, agreement, a, temperature, scale, is, defined, and, said, to, be, absolute, because, it, is, independent, of, the, characteristics, of, particular, thermometric, substances, and, thermometer, mechanisms, apart, from, absolute, zero, it, does, not, have, a, reference, temperature, it, is, known, as, the, kelvin, scale, widely, used, in, science, and, technology, the, kelvin, the, unit, name, is, spelled, with, a, lower, case, k, is, the, unit, of, temperature, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, the, temperature, of, a, body, in, a, state, of, thermodynamic, equilibrium, is, always, positive, relative, to, absolute, zero, besides, the, internationally, agreed, kelvin, scale, there, is, also, a, thermodynamic, temperature, scale, invented, by, lord, kelvin, also, with, its, numerical, zero, at, the, absolute, zero, of, temperature, but, directly, relating, to, purely, macroscopic, thermodynamic, concepts, including, the, macroscopic, entropy, though, microscopically, referable, to, the, gibbs, statistical, mechanical, definition, of, entropy, for, the, canonical, ensemble, that, takes, interparticle, potential, energy, into, account, as, well, as, independent, particle, motion, so, that, it, can, account, for, measurements, of, temperatures, near, absolute, zero, this, scale, has, a, reference, temperature, at, the, triple, point, of, water, the, numerical, value, of, which, is, defined, by, measurements, using, the, aforementioned, internationally, agreed, kelvin, scale, many, scientific, measurements, use, the, kelvin, temperature, scale, unit, symbol, k, named, in, honor, of, the, physicist, who, first, defined, it, it, is, an, absolute, scale, its, numerical, zero, point, 0, k, is, at, the, absolute, zero, of, temperature, since, may, 2019, the, kelvin, has, been, defined, through, particle, kinetic, theory, and, statistical, mechanics, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, the, magnitude, of, the, kelvin, is, defined, in, terms, of, the, boltzmann, constant, the, value, of, which, is, defined, as, fixed, by, international, convention, since, may, 2019, the, magnitude, of, the, kelvin, is, defined, in, relation, to, microscopic, phenomena, characterized, in, terms, of, statistical, mechanics, previously, but, since, 1954, the, international, system, of, units, defined, a, scale, and, unit, for, the, kelvin, as, a, thermodynamic, temperature, by, using, the, reliably, reproducible, temperature, of, the, triple, point, of, water, as, a, second, reference, point, the, first, reference, point, being, 0, k, at, absolute, zero, historically, the, temperature, of, the, triple, point, of, water, was, defined, as, exactly, 273, 16, k, today, it, is, an, empirically, measured, quantity, the, freezing, point, of, water, at, sea, level, atmospheric, pressure, occurs, at, very, close, to, 273, 15, k, 0, c, there, are, various, kinds, of, temperature, scale, it, may, be, convenient, to, classify, them, as, empirically, and, theoretically, based, empirical, temperature, scales, are, historically, older, while, theoretically, based, scales, arose, in, the, middle, of, the, nineteenth, century, empirically, based, temperature, scales, rely, directly, on, measurements, of, simple, macroscopic, physical, properties, of, materials, for, example, the, length, of, a, column, of, mercury, confined, in, a, glass, walled, capillary, tube, is, dependent, largely, on, temperature, and, is, the, basis, of, the, very, useful, mercury, in, glass, thermometer, such, scales, are, valid, only, within, convenient, ranges, of, temperature, for, example, above, the, boiling, point, of, mercury, a, mercury, in, glass, thermometer, is, impracticable, most, materials, expand, with, temperature, increase, but, some, materials, such, as, water, contract, with, temperature, increase, over, some, specific, range, and, then, they, are, hardly, useful, as, thermometric, materials, a, material, is, of, no, use, as, a, thermometer, near, one, of, its, phase, change, temperatures, for, example, its, boiling, point, in, spite, of, these, limitations, most, generally, used, practical, thermometers, are, of, the, empirically, based, kind, especially, it, was, used, for, calorimetry, which, contributed, greatly, to, the, discovery, of, thermodynamics, nevertheless, empirical, thermometry, has, serious, drawbacks, when, judged, as, a, basis, for, theoretical, physics, empirically, based, thermometers, beyond, their, base, as, simple, direct, measurements, of, ordinary, physical, properties, of, thermometric, materials, can, be, re, calibrated, by, use, of, theoretical, physical, reasoning, and, this, can, extend, their, range, of, adequacy, theoretically, based, temperature, scales, are, based, directly, on, theoretical, arguments, especially, those, of, kinetic, theory, and, thermodynamics, they, are, more, or, less, ideally, realized, in, practically, feasible, physical, devices, and, materials, theoretically, based, temperature, scales, are, used, to, provide, calibrating, standards, for, practical, empirically, based, thermometers, in, physics, the, internationally, agreed, conventional, temperature, scale, is, called, the, kelvin, scale, it, is, calibrated, through, the, internationally, agreed, and, prescribed, value, of, the, boltzmann, constant, referring, to, motions, of, microscopic, particles, such, as, atoms, molecules, and, electrons, constituent, in, the, body, whose, temperature, is, to, be, measured, in, contrast, with, the, thermodynamic, temperature, scale, invented, by, kelvin, the, presently, conventional, kelvin, temperature, is, not, defined, through, comparison, with, the, temperature, of, a, reference, state, of, a, standard, body, nor, in, terms, of, macroscopic, thermodynamics, apart, from, the, absolute, zero, of, temperature, the, kelvin, temperature, of, a, body, in, a, state, of, internal, thermodynamic, equilibrium, is, defined, by, measurements, of, suitably, chosen, of, its, physical, properties, such, as, have, precisely, known, theoretical, explanations, in, terms, of, the, boltzmann, constant, that, constant, refers, to, chosen, kinds, of, motion, of, microscopic, particles, in, the, constitution, of, the, body, in, those, kinds, of, motion, the, particles, move, individually, without, mutual, interaction, such, motions, are, typically, interrupted, by, inter, particle, collisions, but, for, temperature, measurement, the, motions, are, chosen, so, that, between, collisions, the, non, interactive, segments, of, their, trajectories, are, known, to, be, accessible, to, accurate, measurement, for, this, purpose, interparticle, potential, energy, is, disregarded, in, an, ideal, gas, and, in, other, theoretically, understood, bodies, the, kelvin, temperature, is, defined, to, be, proportional, to, the, average, kinetic, energy, of, non, interactively, moving, microscopic, particles, which, can, be, measured, by, suitable, techniques, the, proportionality, constant, is, a, simple, multiple, of, the, boltzmann, constant, if, molecules, atoms, or, electrons, are, emitted, from, material, and, their, velocities, are, measured, the, spectrum, of, their, velocities, often, nearly, obeys, a, theoretical, law, called, the, maxwell, boltzmann, distribution, which, gives, a, well, founded, measurement, of, temperatures, for, which, the, law, holds, there, have, not, yet, been, successful, experiments, of, this, same, kind, that, directly, use, the, fermi, dirac, distribution, for, thermometry, but, perhaps, that, will, be, achieved, in, the, future, the, speed, of, sound, in, a, gas, can, be, calculated, theoretically, from, the, gas, s, molecular, character, temperature, pressure, and, the, boltzmann, constant, for, a, gas, of, known, molecular, character, and, pressure, this, provides, a, relation, between, temperature, and, the, boltzmann, constant, those, quantities, can, be, known, or, measured, more, precisely, than, can, the, thermodynamic, variables, that, define, the, state, of, a, sample, of, water, at, its, triple, point, consequently, taking, the, value, of, the, boltzmann, constant, as, a, primarily, defined, reference, of, exactly, defined, value, a, measurement, of, the, speed, of, sound, can, provide, a, more, precise, measurement, of, the, temperature, of, the, gas, measurement, of, the, spectrum, of, electromagnetic, radiation, from, an, ideal, three, dimensional, black, body, can, provide, an, accurate, temperature, measurement, because, the, frequency, of, maximum, spectral, radiance, of, black, body, radiation, is, directly, proportional, to, the, temperature, of, the, black, body, this, is, known, as, wien, s, displacement, law, and, has, a, theoretical, explanation, in, planck, s, law, and, the, bose, einstein, law, measurement, of, the, spectrum, of, noise, power, produced, by, an, electrical, resistor, can, also, provide, accurate, temperature, measurement, the, resistor, has, two, terminals, and, is, in, effect, a, one, dimensional, body, the, bose, einstein, law, for, this, case, indicates, that, the, noise, power, is, directly, proportional, to, the, temperature, of, the, resistor, and, to, the, value, of, its, resistance, and, to, the, noise, bandwidth, in, a, given, frequency, band, the, noise, power, has, equal, contributions, from, every, frequency, and, is, called, johnson, noise, if, the, value, of, the, resistance, is, known, then, the, temperature, can, be, found, historically, till, may, 2019, the, definition, of, the, kelvin, scale, was, that, invented, by, kelvin, based, on, a, ratio, of, quantities, of, energy, in, processes, in, an, ideal, carnot, engine, entirely, in, terms, of, macroscopic, thermodynamics, that, carnot, engine, was, to, work, between, two, temperatures, that, of, the, body, whose, temperature, was, to, be, measured, and, a, reference, that, of, a, body, at, the, temperature, of, the, triple, point, of, water, then, the, reference, temperature, that, of, the, triple, point, was, defined, to, be, exactly, 273, 16, k, since, may, 2019, that, value, has, not, been, fixed, by, definition, but, is, to, be, measured, through, microscopic, phenomena, involving, the, boltzmann, constant, as, described, above, the, microscopic, statistical, mechanical, definition, does, not, have, a, reference, temperature, a, material, on, which, a, macroscopically, defined, temperature, scale, may, be, based, is, the, ideal, gas, the, pressure, exerted, by, a, fixed, volume, and, mass, of, an, ideal, gas, is, directly, proportional, to, its, temperature, some, natural, gases, show, so, nearly, ideal, properties, over, suitable, temperature, range, that, they, can, be, used, for, thermometry, this, was, important, during, the, development, of, thermodynamics, and, is, still, of, practical, importance, today, the, ideal, gas, thermometer, is, however, not, theoretically, perfect, for, thermodynamics, this, is, because, the, entropy, of, an, ideal, gas, at, its, absolute, zero, of, temperature, is, not, a, positive, semi, definite, quantity, which, puts, the, gas, in, violation, of, the, third, law, of, thermodynamics, in, contrast, to, real, materials, the, ideal, gas, does, not, liquefy, or, solidify, no, matter, how, cold, it, is, alternatively, thinking, the, ideal, gas, law, refers, to, the, limit, of, infinitely, high, temperature, and, zero, pressure, these, conditions, guarantee, non, interactive, motions, of, the, constituent, molecules, the, magnitude, of, the, kelvin, is, now, defined, in, terms, of, kinetic, theory, derived, from, the, value, of, the, boltzmann, constant, kinetic, theory, provides, a, microscopic, account, of, temperature, for, some, bodies, of, material, especially, gases, based, on, macroscopic, systems, being, composed, of, many, microscopic, particles, such, as, molecules, and, ions, of, various, species, the, particles, of, a, species, being, all, alike, it, explains, macroscopic, phenomena, through, the, classical, mechanics, of, the, microscopic, particles, the, equipartition, theorem, of, kinetic, theory, asserts, that, each, classical, degree, of, freedom, of, a, freely, moving, particle, has, an, average, kinetic, energy, of, k, b, t, 2, where, k, b, denotes, the, boltzmann, constant, the, translational, motion, of, the, particle, has, three, degrees, of, freedom, so, that, except, at, very, low, temperatures, where, quantum, effects, predominate, the, average, translational, kinetic, energy, of, a, freely, moving, particle, in, a, system, with, temperature, t, will, be, 3, k, b, t, 2, molecules, such, as, oxygen, o, 2, have, more, degrees, of, freedom, than, single, spherical, atoms, they, undergo, rotational, and, vibrational, motions, as, well, as, translations, heating, results, in, an, increase, of, temperature, due, to, an, increase, in, the, average, translational, kinetic, energy, of, the, molecules, heating, will, also, cause, through, equipartitioning, the, energy, associated, with, vibrational, and, rotational, modes, to, increase, thus, a, diatomic, gas, will, require, more, energy, input, to, increase, its, temperature, by, a, certain, amount, i, e, it, will, have, a, greater, heat, capacity, than, a, monatomic, gas, as, noted, above, the, speed, of, sound, in, a, gas, can, be, calculated, from, the, gas, s, molecular, character, temperature, pressure, and, the, boltzmann, constant, taking, the, value, of, the, boltzmann, constant, as, a, primarily, defined, reference, of, exactly, defined, value, a, measurement, of, the, speed, of, sound, can, provide, a, more, precise, measurement, of, the, temperature, of, the, gas, it, is, possible, to, measure, the, average, kinetic, energy, of, constituent, microscopic, particles, if, they, are, allowed, to, escape, from, the, bulk, of, the, system, through, a, small, hole, in, the, containing, wall, the, spectrum, of, velocities, has, to, be, measured, and, the, average, calculated, from, that, it, is, not, necessarily, the, case, that, the, particles, that, escape, and, are, measured, have, the, same, velocity, distribution, as, the, particles, that, remain, in, the, bulk, of, the, system, but, sometimes, a, good, sample, is, possible, temperature, is, one, of, the, principal, quantities, in, the, study, of, thermodynamics, formerly, the, magnitude, of, the, kelvin, was, defined, in, thermodynamic, terms, but, nowadays, as, mentioned, above, it, is, defined, in, terms, of, kinetic, theory, the, thermodynamic, temperature, is, said, to, be, absolute, for, two, reasons, one, is, that, its, formal, character, is, independent, of, the, properties, of, particular, materials, the, other, reason, is, that, its, zero, is, in, a, sense, absolute, in, that, it, indicates, absence, of, microscopic, classical, motion, of, the, constituent, particles, of, matter, so, that, they, have, a, limiting, specific, heat, of, zero, for, zero, temperature, according, to, the, third, law, of, thermodynamics, nevertheless, a, thermodynamic, temperature, does, in, fact, have, a, definite, numerical, value, that, has, been, arbitrarily, chosen, by, tradition, and, is, dependent, on, the, property, of, particular, materials, it, is, simply, less, arbitrary, than, relative, degrees, scales, such, as, celsius, and, fahrenheit, being, an, absolute, scale, with, one, fixed, point, zero, there, is, only, one, degree, of, freedom, left, to, arbitrary, choice, rather, than, two, as, in, relative, scales, for, the, kelvin, scale, since, may, 2019, by, international, convention, the, choice, has, been, made, to, use, knowledge, of, modes, of, operation, of, various, thermometric, devices, relying, on, microscopic, kinetic, theories, about, molecular, motion, the, numerical, scale, is, settled, by, a, conventional, definition, of, the, value, of, the, boltzmann, constant, which, relates, macroscopic, temperature, to, average, microscopic, kinetic, energy, of, particles, such, as, molecules, its, numerical, value, is, arbitrary, and, an, alternate, less, widely, used, absolute, temperature, scale, exists, called, the, rankine, scale, made, to, be, aligned, with, the, fahrenheit, scale, as, kelvin, is, with, celsius, the, thermodynamic, definition, of, temperature, is, due, to, kelvin, it, is, framed, in, terms, of, an, idealized, device, called, a, carnot, engine, imagined, to, run, in, a, fictive, continuous, cycle, of, successive, processes, that, traverse, a, cycle, of, states, of, its, working, body, the, engine, takes, in, a, quantity, of, heat, q, 1, from, a, hot, reservoir, and, passes, out, a, lesser, quantity, of, waste, heat, q, 2, 0, to, a, cold, reservoir, the, net, heat, energy, absorbed, by, the, working, body, is, passed, as, thermodynamic, work, to, a, work, reservoir, and, is, considered, to, be, the, output, of, the, engine, the, cycle, is, imagined, to, run, so, slowly, that, at, each, point, of, the, cycle, the, working, body, is, in, a, state, of, thermodynamic, equilibrium, the, successive, processes, of, the, cycle, are, thus, imagined, to, run, reversibly, with, no, entropy, production, then, the, quantity, of, entropy, taken, in, from, the, hot, reservoir, when, the, working, body, is, heated, is, equal, to, that, passed, to, the, cold, reservoir, when, the, working, body, is, cooled, then, the, absolute, or, thermodynamic, temperatures, t, 1, and, t, 2, of, the, reservoirs, are, defined, such, that, the, zeroth, law, of, thermodynamics, allows, this, definition, to, be, used, to, measure, the, absolute, or, thermodynamic, temperature, of, an, arbitrary, body, of, interest, by, making, the, other, heat, reservoir, have, the, same, temperature, as, the, body, of, interest, kelvin, s, original, work, postulating, absolute, temperature, was, published, in, 1848, it, was, based, on, the, work, of, carnot, before, the, formulation, of, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, carnot, had, no, sound, understanding, of, heat, and, no, specific, concept, of, entropy, he, wrote, of, caloric, and, said, that, all, the, caloric, that, passed, from, the, hot, reservoir, was, passed, into, the, cold, reservoir, kelvin, wrote, in, his, 1848, paper, that, his, scale, was, absolute, in, the, sense, that, it, was, defined, independently, of, the, properties, of, any, particular, kind, of, matter, his, definitive, publication, which, sets, out, the, definition, just, stated, was, printed, in, 1853, a, paper, read, in, 1851, numerical, details, were, formerly, settled, by, making, one, of, the, heat, reservoirs, a, cell, at, the, triple, point, of, water, which, was, defined, to, have, an, absolute, temperature, of, 273, 16, k, nowadays, the, numerical, value, is, instead, obtained, from, measurement, through, the, microscopic, statistical, mechanical, international, definition, as, above, in, thermodynamic, terms, temperature, is, an, intensive, variable, because, it, is, equal, to, a, differential, coefficient, of, one, extensive, variable, with, respect, to, another, for, a, given, body, it, thus, has, the, dimensions, of, a, ratio, of, two, extensive, variables, in, thermodynamics, two, bodies, are, often, considered, as, connected, by, contact, with, a, common, wall, which, has, some, specific, permeability, properties, such, specific, permeability, can, be, referred, to, a, specific, intensive, variable, an, example, is, a, diathermic, wall, that, is, permeable, only, to, heat, the, intensive, variable, for, this, case, is, temperature, when, the, two, bodies, have, been, connected, through, the, specifically, permeable, wall, for, a, very, long, time, and, have, settled, to, a, permanent, steady, state, the, relevant, intensive, variables, are, equal, in, the, two, bodies, for, a, diathermal, wall, this, statement, is, sometimes, called, the, zeroth, law, of, thermodynamics, in, particular, when, the, body, is, described, by, stating, its, internal, energy, u, an, extensive, variable, as, a, function, of, its, entropy, s, also, an, extensive, variable, and, other, state, variables, v, n, with, u, u, s, v, n, then, the, temperature, is, equal, to, the, partial, derivative, of, the, internal, energy, with, respect, to, the, entropy, likewise, when, the, body, is, described, by, stating, its, entropy, s, as, a, function, of, its, internal, energy, u, and, other, state, variables, v, n, with, s, s, u, v, n, then, the, reciprocal, of, the, temperature, is, equal, to, the, partial, derivative, of, the, entropy, with, respect, to, the, internal, energy, the, above, definition, equation, 1, of, the, absolute, temperature, is, due, to, kelvin, it, refers, to, systems, closed, to, the, transfer, of, matter, and, has, a, special, emphasis, on, directly, experimental, procedures, a, presentation, of, thermodynamics, by, gibbs, starts, at, a, more, abstract, level, and, deals, with, systems, open, to, the, transfer, of, matter, in, this, development, of, thermodynamics, the, equations, 2, and, 3, above, are, actually, alternative, definitions, of, temperature, real, world, bodies, are, often, not, in, thermodynamic, equilibrium, and, not, homogeneous, for, the, study, by, methods, of, classical, irreversible, thermodynamics, a, body, is, usually, spatially, and, temporally, divided, conceptually, into, cells, of, small, size, if, classical, thermodynamic, equilibrium, conditions, for, matter, are, fulfilled, to, good, approximation, in, such, a, cell, then, it, is, homogeneous, and, a, temperature, exists, for, it, if, this, is, so, for, every, cell, of, the, body, then, local, thermodynamic, equilibrium, is, said, to, prevail, throughout, the, body, it, makes, good, sense, for, example, to, say, of, the, extensive, variable, u, or, of, the, extensive, variable, s, that, it, has, a, density, per, unit, volume, or, a, quantity, per, unit, mass, of, the, system, but, it, makes, no, sense, to, speak, of, the, density, of, temperature, per, unit, volume, or, quantity, of, temperature, per, unit, mass, of, the, system, on, the, other, hand, it, makes, no, sense, to, speak, of, the, internal, energy, at, a, point, while, when, local, thermodynamic, equilibrium, prevails, it, makes, good, sense, to, speak, of, the, temperature, at, a, point, consequently, the, temperature, can, vary, from, point, to, point, in, a, medium, that, is, not, in, global, thermodynamic, equilibrium, but, in, which, there, is, local, thermodynamic, equilibrium, thus, when, local, thermodynamic, equilibrium, prevails, in, a, body, the, temperature, can, be, regarded, as, a, spatially, varying, local, property, in, that, body, and, this, is, because, the, temperature, is, an, intensive, variable, temperature, is, a, measure, of, a, quality, of, a, state, of, a, material, the, quality, may, be, regarded, as, a, more, abstract, entity, than, any, particular, temperature, scale, that, measures, it, and, is, called, hotness, by, some, writers, the, quality, of, hotness, refers, to, the, state, of, material, only, in, a, particular, locality, and, in, general, apart, from, bodies, held, in, a, steady, state, of, thermodynamic, equilibrium, hotness, varies, from, place, to, place, it, is, not, necessarily, the, case, that, a, material, in, a, particular, place, is, in, a, state, that, is, steady, and, nearly, homogeneous, enough, to, allow, it, to, have, a, well, defined, hotness, or, temperature, hotness, may, be, represented, abstractly, as, a, one, dimensional, manifold, every, valid, temperature, scale, has, its, own, one, to, one, map, into, the, hotness, manifold, when, two, systems, in, thermal, contact, are, at, the, same, temperature, no, heat, transfers, between, them, when, a, temperature, difference, does, exist, heat, flows, spontaneously, from, the, warmer, system, to, the, colder, system, until, they, are, in, thermal, equilibrium, such, heat, transfer, occurs, by, conduction, or, by, thermal, radiation, experimental, physicists, for, example, galileo, and, newton, found, that, there, are, indefinitely, many, empirical, temperature, scales, nevertheless, the, zeroth, law, of, thermodynamics, says, that, they, all, measure, the, same, quality, this, means, that, for, a, body, in, its, own, state, of, internal, thermodynamic, equilibrium, every, correctly, calibrated, thermometer, of, whatever, kind, that, measures, the, temperature, of, the, body, records, one, and, the, same, temperature, for, a, body, that, is, not, in, its, own, state, of, internal, thermodynamic, equilibrium, different, thermometers, can, record, different, temperatures, depending, respectively, on, the, mechanisms, of, operation, of, the, thermometers, for, experimental, physics, hotness, means, that, when, comparing, any, two, given, bodies, in, their, respective, separate, thermodynamic, equilibria, any, two, suitably, given, empirical, thermometers, with, numerical, scale, readings, will, agree, as, to, which, is, the, hotter, of, the, two, given, bodies, or, that, they, have, the, same, temperature, this, does, not, require, the, two, thermometers, to, have, a, linear, relation, between, their, numerical, scale, readings, but, it, does, require, that, the, relation, between, their, numerical, readings, shall, be, strictly, monotonic, a, definite, sense, of, greater, hotness, can, be, had, independently, of, calorimetry, of, thermodynamics, and, of, properties, of, particular, materials, from, wien, s, displacement, law, of, thermal, radiation, the, temperature, of, a, bath, of, thermal, radiation, is, proportional, by, a, universal, constant, to, the, frequency, of, the, maximum, of, its, frequency, spectrum, this, frequency, is, always, positive, but, can, have, values, that, tend, to, zero, thermal, radiation, is, initially, defined, for, a, cavity, in, thermodynamic, equilibrium, these, physical, facts, justify, a, mathematical, statement, that, hotness, exists, on, an, ordered, one, dimensional, manifold, this, is, a, fundamental, character, of, temperature, and, thermometers, for, bodies, in, their, own, thermodynamic, equilibrium, except, for, a, system, undergoing, a, first, order, phase, change, such, as, the, melting, of, ice, as, a, closed, system, receives, heat, without, a, change, in, its, volume, and, without, a, change, in, external, force, fields, acting, on, it, its, temperature, rises, for, a, system, undergoing, such, a, phase, change, so, slowly, that, departure, from, thermodynamic, equilibrium, can, be, neglected, its, temperature, remains, constant, as, the, system, is, supplied, with, latent, heat, conversely, a, loss, of, heat, from, a, closed, system, without, phase, change, without, change, of, volume, and, without, a, change, in, external, force, fields, acting, on, it, decreases, its, temperature, while, for, bodies, in, their, own, thermodynamic, equilibrium, states, the, notion, of, temperature, requires, that, all, empirical, thermometers, must, agree, as, to, which, of, two, bodies, is, the, hotter, or, that, they, are, at, the, same, temperature, this, requirement, is, not, safe, for, bodies, that, are, in, steady, states, though, not, in, thermodynamic, equilibrium, it, can, then, well, be, that, different, empirical, thermometers, disagree, about, which, is, hotter, and, if, this, is, so, then, at, least, one, of, the, bodies, does, not, have, a, well, defined, absolute, thermodynamic, temperature, nevertheless, any, one, given, body, and, any, one, suitable, empirical, thermometer, can, still, support, notions, of, empirical, non, absolute, hotness, and, temperature, for, a, suitable, range, of, processes, this, is, a, matter, for, study, in, non, equilibrium, thermodynamics, when, a, body, is, not, in, a, steady, state, then, the, notion, of, temperature, becomes, even, less, safe, than, for, a, body, in, a, steady, state, not, in, thermodynamic, equilibrium, this, is, also, a, matter, for, study, in, non, equilibrium, thermodynamics, for, the, axiomatic, treatment, of, thermodynamic, equilibrium, since, the, 1930s, it, has, become, customary, to, refer, to, a, zeroth, law, of, thermodynamics, the, customarily, stated, minimalist, version, of, such, a, law, postulates, only, that, all, bodies, which, when, thermally, connected, would, be, in, thermal, equilibrium, should, be, said, to, have, the, same, temperature, by, definition, but, by, itself, does, not, establish, temperature, as, a, quantity, expressed, as, a, real, number, on, a, scale, a, more, physically, informative, version, of, such, a, law, views, empirical, temperature, as, a, chart, on, a, hotness, manifold, while, the, zeroth, law, permits, the, definitions, of, many, different, empirical, scales, of, temperature, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, selects, the, definition, of, a, single, preferred, absolute, temperature, unique, up, to, an, arbitrary, scale, factor, whence, called, the, thermodynamic, temperature, if, internal, energy, is, considered, as, a, function, of, the, volume, and, entropy, of, a, homogeneous, system, in, thermodynamic, equilibrium, thermodynamic, absolute, temperature, appears, as, the, partial, derivative, of, internal, energy, with, respect, the, entropy, at, constant, volume, its, natural, intrinsic, origin, or, null, point, is, absolute, zero, at, which, the, entropy, of, any, system, is, at, a, minimum, although, this, is, the, lowest, absolute, temperature, described, by, the, model, the, third, law, of, thermodynamics, postulates, that, absolute, zero, cannot, be, attained, by, any, physical, system, when, an, energy, transfer, to, or, from, a, body, is, only, as, heat, the, state, of, the, body, changes, depending, on, the, surroundings, and, the, walls, separating, them, from, the, body, various, changes, are, possible, in, the, body, they, include, chemical, reactions, increase, of, pressure, increase, of, temperature, and, phase, change, for, each, kind, of, change, under, specified, conditions, the, heat, capacity, is, the, ratio, of, the, quantity, of, heat, transferred, to, the, magnitude, of, the, change, for, example, if, the, change, is, an, increase, in, temperature, at, constant, volume, with, no, phase, change, and, no, chemical, change, then, the, temperature, of, the, body, rises, and, its, pressure, increases, the, quantity, of, heat, transferred, q, divided, by, the, observed, temperature, change, t, is, the, body, s, heat, capacity, at, constant, volume, if, heat, capacity, is, measured, for, a, well, defined, amount, of, substance, the, specific, heat, is, the, measure, of, the, heat, required, to, increase, the, temperature, of, such, a, unit, quantity, by, one, unit, of, temperature, for, example, raising, the, temperature, of, water, by, one, kelvin, equal, to, one, degree, celsius, requires, 4186, joules, per, kilogram, j, kg, temperature, measurement, using, modern, scientific, thermometers, and, temperature, scales, goes, back, at, least, as, far, as, the, early, 18th, century, when, daniel, gabriel, fahrenheit, adapted, a, thermometer, switching, to, mercury, and, a, scale, both, developed, by, ole, christensen, r, mer, fahrenheit, s, scale, is, still, in, use, in, the, united, states, for, non, scientific, applications, temperature, is, measured, with, thermometers, that, may, be, calibrated, to, a, variety, of, temperature, scales, in, most, of, the, world, except, for, belize, myanmar, liberia, and, the, united, states, the, celsius, scale, is, used, for, most, temperature, measuring, purposes, most, scientists, measure, temperature, using, the, celsius, scale, and, thermodynamic, temperature, using, the, kelvin, scale, which, is, the, celsius, scale, offset, so, that, its, null, point, is, 0, k, 273, 15, c, or, absolute, zero, many, engineering, fields, in, the, us, notably, high, tech, and, us, federal, specifications, civil, and, military, also, use, the, kelvin, and, celsius, scales, other, engineering, fields, in, the, us, also, rely, upon, the, rankine, scale, a, shifted, fahrenheit, scale, when, working, in, thermodynamic, related, disciplines, such, as, combustion, the, basic, unit, of, temperature, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, is, the, kelvin, it, has, the, symbol, k, for, everyday, applications, it, is, often, convenient, to, use, the, celsius, scale, in, which, 0, c, corresponds, very, closely, to, the, freezing, point, of, water, and, 100, c, is, its, boiling, point, at, sea, level, because, liquid, droplets, commonly, exist, in, clouds, at, sub, zero, temperatures, 0, c, is, better, defined, as, the, melting, point, of, ice, in, this, scale, a, temperature, difference, of, 1, degree, celsius, is, the, same, as, a, 1, kelvin, increment, but, the, scale, is, offset, by, the, temperature, at, which, ice, melts, 273, 15, k, by, international, agreement, until, may, 2019, the, kelvin, and, celsius, scales, were, defined, by, two, fixing, points, absolute, zero, and, the, triple, point, of, vienna, standard, mean, ocean, water, which, is, water, specially, prepared, with, a, specified, blend, of, hydrogen, and, oxygen, isotopes, absolute, zero, was, defined, as, precisely, 0, k, and, 273, 15, c, it, is, the, temperature, at, which, all, classical, translational, motion, of, the, particles, comprising, matter, ceases, and, they, are, at, complete, rest, in, the, classical, model, quantum, mechanically, however, zero, point, motion, remains, and, has, an, associated, energy, the, zero, point, energy, matter, is, in, its, ground, state, and, contains, no, thermal, energy, the, temperatures, 273, 16, k, and, 0, 01, c, were, defined, as, those, of, the, triple, point, of, water, this, definition, served, the, following, purposes, it, fixed, the, magnitude, of, the, kelvin, as, being, precisely, 1, part, in, 273, 16, parts, of, the, difference, between, absolute, zero, and, the, triple, point, of, water, it, established, that, one, kelvin, has, precisely, the, same, magnitude, as, one, degree, on, the, celsius, scale, and, it, established, the, difference, between, the, null, points, of, these, scales, as, being, 273, 15, k, 0, k, 273, 15, c, and, 273, 16, k, 0, 01, c, since, 2019, there, has, been, a, new, definition, based, on, the, boltzmann, constant, but, the, scales, are, scarcely, changed, in, the, united, states, the, fahrenheit, scale, is, the, most, widely, used, on, this, scale, the, freezing, point, of, water, corresponds, to, 32, f, and, the, boiling, point, to, 212, f, the, rankine, scale, still, used, in, fields, of, chemical, engineering, in, the, us, is, an, absolute, scale, based, on, the, fahrenheit, increment, the, following, temperature, scales, are, in, use, or, have, historically, been, used, for, measuring, temperature, the, field, of, plasma, physics, deals, with, phenomena, of, electromagnetic, nature, that, involve, very, high, temperatures, it, is, customary, to, express, temperature, as, energy, in, a, unit, related, to, the, electronvolt, or, kiloelectronvolt, ev, k, b, or, kev, k, b, the, corresponding, energy, which, is, dimensionally, distinct, from, temperature, is, then, calculated, as, the, product, of, the, boltzmann, constant, and, temperature, e, k, b, t, displaystyle, e, k, text, b, t, then, 1, ev, k, b, is, 11, 605, k, in, the, study, of, qcd, matter, one, routinely, encounters, temperatures, of, the, order, of, a, few, hundred, mev, k, b, equivalent, to, about, 10, 12, k, when, one, measures, the, variation, of, temperature, across, a, region, of, space, or, time, do, the, temperature, measurements, turn, out, to, be, continuous, or, discrete, there, is, a, widely, held, misconception, that, such, temperature, measurements, must, always, be, continuous, this, misconception, partly, originates, from, the, historical, view, associated, with, the, continuity, of, classical, physical, quantities, which, states, that, physical, quantities, must, assume, every, intermediate, value, between, a, starting, value, and, a, final, value, however, the, classical, picture, is, only, true, in, the, cases, where, temperature, is, measured, in, a, system, that, is, in, equilibrium, that, is, temperature, may, not, be, continuous, outside, these, conditions, for, systems, outside, equilibrium, such, as, at, interfaces, between, materials, e, g, a, metal, non, metal, interface, or, a, liquid, vapour, interface, temperature, measurements, may, show, steep, discontinuities, in, time, and, space, for, instance, fang, and, ward, were, some, of, the, first, authors, to, successfully, report, temperature, discontinuities, of, as, much, as, 7, 8, k, at, the, surface, of, evaporating, water, droplets, this, was, reported, at, inter, molecular, scales, or, at, the, scale, of, the, mean, free, path, of, molecules, which, is, typically, of, the, order, of, a, few, micrometers, in, gases, at, room, temperature, generally, speaking, temperature, discontinuities, are, considered, to, be, norms, rather, than, exceptions, in, cases, of, interfacial, heat, transfer, this, is, due, to, the, abrupt, change, in, the, vibrational, or, thermal, properties, of, the, materials, across, such, interfaces, which, prevent, instantaneous, transfer, of, heat, and, the, establishment, of, thermal, equilibrium, a, prerequisite, for, having, a, uniform, equilibrium, temperature, across, the, interface, further, temperature, measurements, at, the, macro, scale, typical, observational, scale, may, be, too, coarse, grained, as, they, average, out, the, microscopic, thermal, information, based, on, the, scale, of, the, representative, sample, volume, of, the, control, system, and, thus, it, is, likely, that, temperature, discontinuities, at, the, micro, scale, may, be, overlooked, in, such, averages, such, an, averaging, may, even, produce, incorrect, or, misleading, results, in, many, cases, of, temperature, measurements, even, at, macro, scales, and, thus, it, is, prudent, that, one, examines, the, micro, physical, information, carefully, before, averaging, out, or, smoothing, out, any, potential, temperature, discontinuities, in, a, system, as, such, discontinuities, cannot, always, be, averaged, or, smoothed, out, temperature, discontiuities, rather, than, merely, being, anomalies, have, actually, substantially, improved, our, understanding, and, predictive, abilities, pertaining, to, heat, transfer, at, small, scales, historically, there, are, several, scientific, approaches, to, the, explanation, of, temperature, the, classical, thermodynamic, description, based, on, macroscopic, empirical, variables, that, can, be, measured, in, a, laboratory, the, kinetic, theory, of, gases, which, relates, the, macroscopic, description, to, the, probability, distribution, of, the, energy, of, motion, of, gas, particles, and, a, microscopic, explanation, based, on, statistical, physics, and, quantum, mechanics, in, addition, rigorous, and, purely, mathematical, treatments, have, provided, an, axiomatic, approach, to, classical, thermodynamics, and, temperature, statistical, physics, provides, a, deeper, understanding, by, describing, the, atomic, behavior, of, matter, and, derives, macroscopic, properties, from, statistical, averages, of, microscopic, states, including, both, classical, and, quantum, states, in, the, fundamental, physical, description, the, temperature, may, be, measured, directly, in, units, of, energy, however, in, the, practical, systems, of, measurement, for, science, technology, and, commerce, such, as, the, modern, metric, system, of, units, the, macroscopic, and, the, microscopic, descriptions, are, interrelated, by, the, boltzmann, constant, a, proportionality, factor, that, scales, temperature, to, the, microscopic, mean, kinetic, energy, the, microscopic, description, in, statistical, mechanics, is, based, on, a, model, that, analyzes, a, system, into, its, fundamental, particles, of, matter, or, into, a, set, of, classical, or, quantum, mechanical, oscillators, and, considers, the, system, as, a, statistical, ensemble, of, microstates, as, a, collection, of, classical, material, particles, the, temperature, is, a, measure, of, the, mean, energy, of, motion, called, translational, kinetic, energy, of, the, particles, whether, in, solids, liquids, gases, or, plasmas, the, kinetic, energy, a, concept, of, classical, mechanics, is, half, the, mass, of, a, particle, times, its, speed, squared, in, this, mechanical, interpretation, of, thermal, motion, the, kinetic, energies, of, material, particles, may, reside, in, the, velocity, of, the, particles, of, their, translational, or, vibrational, motion, or, in, the, inertia, of, their, rotational, modes, in, monatomic, perfect, gases, and, approximately, in, most, gas, and, in, simple, metals, the, temperature, is, a, measure, of, the, mean, particle, translational, kinetic, energy, 3, 2, k, b, t, it, also, determines, the, probability, distribution, function, of, energy, in, condensed, matter, and, particularly, in, solids, this, purely, mechanical, description, is, often, less, useful, and, the, oscillator, model, provides, a, better, description, to, account, for, quantum, mechanical, phenomena, temperature, determines, the, statistical, occupation, of, the, microstates, of, the, ensemble, the, microscopic, definition, of, temperature, is, only, meaningful, in, the, thermodynamic, limit, meaning, for, large, ensembles, of, states, or, particles, to, fulfill, the, requirements, of, the, statistical, model, kinetic, energy, is, also, considered, as, a, component, of, thermal, energy, the, thermal, energy, may, be, partitioned, into, independent, components, attributed, to, the, degrees, of, freedom, of, the, particles, or, to, the, modes, of, oscillators, in, a, thermodynamic, system, in, general, the, number, of, these, degrees, of, freedom, that, are, available, for, the, equipartitioning, of, energy, depends, on, the, temperature, i, e, the, energy, region, of, the, interactions, under, consideration, for, solids, the, thermal, energy, is, associated, primarily, with, the, vibrations, of, its, atoms, or, molecules, about, their, equilibrium, position, in, an, ideal, monatomic, gas, the, kinetic, energy, is, found, exclusively, in, the, purely, translational, motions, of, the, particles, in, other, systems, vibrational, and, rotational, motions, also, contribute, degrees, of, freedom, maxwell, and, boltzmann, developed, a, kinetic, theory, that, yields, a, fundamental, understanding, of, temperature, in, gases, this, theory, also, explains, the, ideal, gas, law, and, the, observed, heat, capacity, of, monatomic, or, noble, gases, the, ideal, gas, law, is, based, on, observed, empirical, relationships, between, pressure, p, volume, v, and, temperature, t, and, was, recognized, long, before, the, kinetic, theory, of, gases, was, developed, see, boyle, s, and, charles, s, laws, the, ideal, gas, law, states, where, n, is, the, number, of, moles, of, gas, and, r, 8, 314, 462, 618, j, mol, 1, k, 1, is, the, gas, constant, this, relationship, gives, us, our, first, hint, that, there, is, an, absolute, zero, on, the, temperature, scale, because, it, only, holds, if, the, temperature, is, measured, on, an, absolute, scale, such, as, kelvin, s, the, ideal, gas, law, allows, one, to, measure, temperature, on, this, absolute, scale, using, the, gas, thermometer, the, temperature, in, kelvins, can, be, defined, as, the, pressure, in, pascals, of, one, mole, of, gas, in, a, container, of, one, cubic, meter, divided, by, the, gas, constant, although, it, is, not, a, particularly, convenient, device, the, gas, thermometer, provides, an, essential, theoretical, basis, by, which, all, thermometers, can, be, calibrated, as, a, practical, matter, it, is, not, possible, to, use, a, gas, thermometer, to, measure, absolute, zero, temperature, since, the, gases, condense, into, a, liquid, long, before, the, temperature, reaches, zero, it, is, possible, however, to, extrapolate, to, absolute, zero, by, using, the, ideal, gas, law, as, shown, in, the, figure, the, kinetic, theory, assumes, that, pressure, is, caused, by, the, force, associated, with, individual, atoms, striking, the, walls, and, that, all, energy, is, translational, kinetic, energy, using, a, sophisticated, symmetry, argument, boltzmann, deduced, what, is, now, called, the, maxwell, boltzmann, probability, distribution, function, for, the, velocity, of, particles, in, an, ideal, gas, from, that, probability, distribution, function, the, average, kinetic, energy, per, particle, of, a, monatomic, ideal, gas, is, where, the, boltzmann, constant, k, b, is, the, ideal, gas, constant, divided, by, the, avogadro, number, and, v, rms, v, 2, v, v, textstyle, v, text, rms, sqrt, langle, v, 2, rangle, sqrt, langle, mathbf, v, cdot, v, rangle, is, the, root, mean, square, speed, this, direct, proportionality, between, temperature, and, mean, molecular, kinetic, energy, is, a, special, case, of, the, equipartition, theorem, and, holds, only, in, the, classical, limit, of, a, perfect, gas, it, does, not, hold, exactly, for, most, substances, when, two, otherwise, isolated, bodies, are, connected, together, by, a, rigid, physical, path, impermeable, to, matter, there, is, the, spontaneous, transfer, of, energy, as, heat, from, the, hotter, to, the, colder, of, them, eventually, they, reach, a, state, of, mutual, thermal, equilibrium, in, which, heat, transfer, has, ceased, and, the, bodies, respective, state, variables, have, settled, to, become, unchanging, one, statement, of, the, zeroth, law, of, thermodynamics, is, that, if, two, systems, are, each, in, thermal, equilibrium, with, a, third, system, then, they, are, also, in, thermal, equilibrium, with, each, other, this, statement, helps, to, define, temperature, but, it, does, not, by, itself, complete, the, definition, an, empirical, temperature, is, a, numerical, scale, for, the, hotness, of, a, thermodynamic, system, such, hotness, may, be, defined, as, existing, on, a, one, dimensional, manifold, stretching, between, hot, and, cold, sometimes, the, zeroth, law, is, stated, to, include, the, existence, of, a, unique, universal, hotness, manifold, and, of, numerical, scales, on, it, so, as, to, provide, a, complete, definition, of, empirical, temperature, to, be, suitable, for, empirical, thermometry, a, material, must, have, a, monotonic, relation, between, hotness, and, some, easily, measured, state, variable, such, as, pressure, or, volume, when, all, other, relevant, coordinates, are, fixed, an, exceptionally, suitable, system, is, the, ideal, gas, which, can, provide, a, temperature, scale, that, matches, the, absolute, kelvin, scale, the, kelvin, scale, is, defined, on, the, basis, of, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, as, an, alternative, to, considering, or, defining, the, zeroth, law, of, thermodynamics, it, was, the, historical, development, in, thermodynamics, to, define, temperature, in, terms, of, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, which, deals, with, entropy, the, second, law, states, that, any, process, will, result, in, either, no, change, or, a, net, increase, in, the, entropy, of, the, universe, this, can, be, understood, in, terms, of, probability, for, example, in, a, series, of, coin, tosses, a, perfectly, ordered, system, would, be, one, in, which, either, every, toss, comes, up, heads, or, every, toss, comes, up, tails, this, means, the, outcome, is, always, 100, the, same, result, in, contrast, many, mixed, disordered, outcomes, are, possible, and, their, number, increases, with, each, toss, eventually, the, combinations, of, 50, heads, and, 50, tails, dominate, and, obtaining, an, outcome, significantly, different, from, 50, 50, becomes, increasingly, unlikely, thus, the, system, naturally, progresses, to, a, state, of, maximum, disorder, or, entropy, as, temperature, governs, the, transfer, of, heat, between, two, systems, and, the, universe, tends, to, progress, toward, a, maximum, of, entropy, it, is, expected, that, there, is, some, relationship, between, temperature, and, entropy, a, heat, engine, is, a, device, for, converting, thermal, energy, into, mechanical, energy, resulting, in, the, performance, of, work, an, analysis, of, the, carnot, heat, engine, provides, the, necessary, relationships, according, to, energy, conservation, and, energy, being, a, state, function, that, does, not, change, over, a, full, cycle, the, work, from, a, heat, engine, over, a, full, cycle, is, equal, to, the, net, heat, i, e, the, sum, of, the, heat, put, into, the, system, at, high, temperature, q, h, 0, and, the, waste, heat, given, off, at, the, low, temperature, q, c, 0, the, efficiency, is, the, work, divided, by, the, heat, input, where, w, cy, is, the, work, done, per, cycle, the, efficiency, depends, only, on, q, c, q, h, because, q, c, and, q, h, correspond, to, heat, transfer, at, the, temperatures, t, c, and, t, h, respectively, q, c, q, h, should, be, some, function, of, these, temperatures, carnot, s, theorem, states, that, all, reversible, engines, operating, between, the, same, heat, reservoirs, are, equally, efficient, thus, a, heat, engine, operating, between, t, 1, and, t, 3, must, have, the, same, efficiency, as, one, consisting, of, two, cycles, one, between, t, 1, and, t, 2, and, the, second, between, t, 2, and, t, 3, this, can, only, be, the, case, if, which, implies, since, the, first, function, is, independent, of, t, 2, this, temperature, must, cancel, on, the, right, side, meaning, f, t, 1, t, 3, is, of, the, form, g, t, 1, g, t, 3, i, e, f, t, 1, t, 3, f, t, 1, t, 2, f, t, 2, t, 3, g, t, 1, g, t, 2, g, t, 2, g, t, 3, g, t, 1, g, t, 3, where, g, is, a, function, of, a, single, temperature, a, temperature, scale, can, now, be, chosen, with, the, property, that, substituting, 6, back, into, 4, gives, a, relationship, for, the, efficiency, in, terms, of, temperature, for, t, c, 0, k, the, efficiency, is, 100, and, that, efficiency, becomes, greater, than, 100, below, 0, k, since, an, efficiency, greater, than, 100, violates, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, this, implies, that, 0, k, is, the, minimum, possible, temperature, in, fact, the, lowest, temperature, ever, obtained, in, a, macroscopic, system, was, 20, nk, which, was, achieved, in, 1995, at, nist, subtracting, the, right, hand, side, of, 5, from, the, middle, portion, and, rearranging, gives, where, the, negative, sign, indicates, heat, ejected, from, the, system, this, relationship, suggests, the, existence, of, a, state, function, s, whose, change, characteristically, vanishes, for, a, complete, cycle, if, it, is, defined, by, where, the, subscript, indicates, a, reversible, process, this, function, corresponds, to, the, entropy, of, the, system, which, was, described, previously, rearranging, 8, gives, a, formula, for, temperature, in, terms, of, fictive, infinitesimal, quasi, reversible, elements, of, entropy, and, heat, for, a, constant, volume, system, where, entropy, s, e, is, a, function, of, its, energy, e, d, e, d, q, rev, and, 9, gives, i, e, the, reciprocal, of, the, temperature, is, the, rate, of, increase, of, entropy, with, respect, to, energy, at, constant, volume, statistical, mechanics, defines, temperature, based, on, a, system, s, fundamental, degrees, of, freedom, eq, 10, is, the, defining, relation, of, temperature, where, the, entropy, s, displaystyle, s, is, defined, up, to, a, constant, by, the, logarithm, of, the, number, of, microstates, of, the, system, in, the, given, macrostate, as, specified, in, the, microcanonical, ensemble, where, k, b, displaystyle, k, mathrm, b, is, the, boltzmann, constant, and, w, is, the, number, of, microstates, with, the, energy, e, of, the, system, degeneracy, when, two, systems, with, different, temperatures, are, put, into, purely, thermal, connection, heat, will, flow, from, the, higher, temperature, system, to, the, lower, temperature, one, thermodynamically, this, is, understood, by, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, the, total, change, in, entropy, following, a, transfer, of, energy, e, displaystyle, delta, e, from, system, 1, to, system, 2, is, and, is, thus, positive, if, t, 1, t, 2, displaystyle, t, 1, t, 2, from, the, point, of, view, of, statistical, mechanics, the, total, number, of, microstates, in, the, combined, system, 1, system, 2, is, n, 1, n, 2, displaystyle, n, 1, cdot, n, 2, the, logarithm, of, which, times, the, boltzmann, constant, is, the, sum, of, their, entropies, thus, a, flow, of, heat, from, high, to, low, temperature, which, brings, an, increase, in, total, entropy, is, more, likely, than, any, other, scenario, normally, it, is, much, more, likely, as, there, are, more, microstates, in, the, resulting, macrostate, it, is, possible, to, extend, the, definition, of, temperature, even, to, systems, of, few, particles, like, in, a, quantum, dot, the, generalized, temperature, is, obtained, by, considering, time, ensembles, instead, of, configuration, space, ensembles, given, in, statistical, mechanics, in, the, case, of, thermal, and, particle, exchange, between, a, small, system, of, fermions, n, even, less, than, 10, with, a, single, double, occupancy, system, the, finite, quantum, grand, canonical, ensemble, obtained, under, the, hypothesis, of, ergodicity, and, orthodicity, allows, expressing, the, generalized, temperature, from, the, ratio, of, the, average, time, of, occupation, 1, displaystyle, tau, 1, and, 2, displaystyle, tau, 2, of, the, single, double, occupancy, system, where, e, f, is, the, fermi, energy, this, generalized, temperature, tends, to, the, ordinary, temperature, when, n, goes, to, infinity, on, the, empirical, temperature, scales, that, are, not, referenced, to, absolute, zero, a, negative, temperature, is, one, below, the, zero, point, of, the, scale, used, for, example, dry, ice, has, a, sublimation, temperature, of, 78, 5, c, which, is, equivalent, to, 109, 3, f, on, the, absolute, kelvin, scale, this, temperature, is, 194, 6, k, no, body, can, be, brought, to, exactly, 0, k, the, temperature, of, the, ideally, coldest, possible, body, by, any, finite, practicable, process, this, is, a, consequence, of, the, third, law, of, thermodynamics, the, internal, kinetic, theory, temperature, of, a, body, cannot, take, negative, values, the, thermodynamic, temperature, scale, however, is, not, so, constrained, for, a, body, of, matter, there, can, sometimes, be, conceptually, defined, in, terms, of, microscopic, degrees, of, freedom, namely, particle, spins, a, subsystem, with, a, temperature, other, than, that, of, the, whole, body, when, the, body, is, in, its, own, state, of, internal, thermodynamic, equilibrium, the, temperatures, of, the, whole, body, and, of, the, subsystem, must, be, the, same, the, two, temperatures, can, differ, when, by, work, through, externally, imposed, force, fields, energy, can, be, transferred, to, and, from, the, subsystem, separately, from, the, rest, of, the, body, then, the, whole, body, is, not, in, its, own, state, of, internal, thermodynamic, equilibrium, there, is, an, upper, limit, of, energy, such, a, spin, subsystem, can, attain, considering, the, subsystem, to, be, in, a, temporary, state, of, virtual, thermodynamic, equilibrium, it, is, possible, to, obtain, a, negative, temperature, on, the, thermodynamic, scale, thermodynamic, temperature, is, the, inverse, of, the, derivative, of, the, subsystem, s, entropy, with, respect, to, its, internal, energy, as, the, subsystem, s, internal, energy, increases, the, entropy, increases, for, some, range, but, eventually, attains, a, maximum, value, and, then, begins, to, decrease, as, the, highest, energy, states, begin, to, fill, at, the, point, of, maximum, entropy, the, temperature, function, shows, the, behavior, of, a, singularity, because, the, slope, of, the, entropy, as, a, function, of, energy, decreases, to, zero, and, then, turns, negative, as, the, subsystem, s, entropy, reaches, its, maximum, its, thermodynamic, temperature, goes, to, positive, infinity, switching, to, negative, infinity, as, the, slope, turns, negative, such, negative, temperatures, are, hotter, than, any, positive, temperature, over, time, when, the, subsystem, is, exposed, to, the, rest, of, the, body, which, has, a, positive, temperature, energy, is, transferred, as, heat, from, the, negative, temperature, subsystem, to, the, positive, temperature, system, the, kinetic, theory, temperature, is, not, defined, for, such, subsystems
