polonium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, po, and, atomic, number, 84, a, rare, and, highly, radioactive, metal, although, sometimes, classified, as, a, metalloid, with, no, stable, isotopes, polonium, is, a, chalcogen, and, chemically, similar, to, selenium, and, tellurium, though, its, metallic, character, resembles, that, of, its, horizontal, neighbors, in, the, periodic, table, thallium, lead, and, bismuth, due, to, the, short, half, life, of, all, its, isotopes, its, natural, occurrence, is, limited, to, tiny, traces, of, the, fleeting, polonium, 210, with, a, half, life, of, 138, days, in, uranium, ores, as, it, is, the, penultimate, daughter, of, natural, uranium, 238, though, longer, lived, isotopes, exist, such, as, the, 124, years, half, life, of, polonium, 209, they, are, much, more, difficult, to, produce, today, polonium, is, usually, produced, in, milligram, quantities, by, the, neutron, irradiation, of, bismuth, due, to, its, intense, radioactivity, which, results, in, the, radiolysis, of, chemical, bonds, and, radioactive, self, heating, its, chemistry, has, mostly, been, investigated, on, the, trace, scale, only, polonium, was, discovered, on, july, 18, 1898, by, marie, sk, odowska, curie, and, pierre, curie, when, it, was, extracted, from, the, uranium, ore, pitchblende, and, identified, solely, by, its, strong, radioactivity, it, was, the, first, element, to, be, discovered, in, this, way, polonium, was, named, after, marie, sk, odowska, curie, s, homeland, of, poland, polonium, has, few, applications, and, those, are, related, to, its, radioactivity, heaters, in, space, probes, antistatic, devices, sources, of, neutrons, and, alpha, particles, and, poison, e, g, poisoning, of, alexander, litvinenko, it, is, extremely, dangerous, to, humans, 210, po, is, an, alpha, emitter, that, has, a, half, life, of, 138, 4, days, it, decays, directly, to, its, stable, daughter, isotope, 206, pb, a, milligram, 5, curies, of, 210, po, emits, about, as, many, alpha, particles, per, second, as, 5, grams, of, 226, ra, which, means, it, is, 5, 000, times, more, radioactive, than, radium, a, few, curies, 1, curie, equals, 37, gigabecquerels, 1, ci, 37, gbq, of, 210, po, emit, a, blue, glow, which, is, caused, by, ionisation, of, the, surrounding, air, about, one, in, 100, 000, alpha, emissions, causes, an, excitation, in, the, nucleus, which, then, results, in, the, emission, of, a, gamma, ray, with, a, maximum, energy, of, 803, kev, polonium, is, a, radioactive, element, that, exists, in, two, metallic, allotropes, the, alpha, form, is, the, only, known, example, of, a, simple, cubic, crystal, structure, in, a, single, atom, basis, at, stp, space, group, pm, 3, m, no, 221, the, unit, cell, has, an, edge, length, of, 335, 2, picometers, the, beta, form, is, rhombohedral, the, structure, of, polonium, has, been, characterized, by, x, ray, diffraction, and, electron, diffraction, 210, po, has, the, ability, to, become, airborne, with, ease, if, a, sample, is, heated, in, air, to, 55, c, 131, f, 50, of, it, is, vaporized, in, 45, hours, to, form, diatomic, po, 2, molecules, even, though, the, melting, point, of, polonium, is, 254, c, 489, f, and, its, boiling, point, is, 962, c, 1, 764, f, more, than, one, hypothesis, exists, for, how, polonium, does, this, one, suggestion, is, that, small, clusters, of, polonium, atoms, are, spalled, off, by, the, alpha, decay, the, chemistry, of, polonium, is, similar, to, that, of, tellurium, although, it, also, shows, some, similarities, to, its, neighbor, bismuth, due, to, its, metallic, character, polonium, dissolves, readily, in, dilute, acids, but, is, only, slightly, soluble, in, alkalis, polonium, solutions, are, first, colored, in, pink, by, the, po, 2, ions, but, then, rapidly, become, yellow, because, alpha, radiation, from, polonium, ionizes, the, solvent, and, converts, po, 2, into, po, 4, as, polonium, also, emits, alpha, particles, after, disintegration, so, this, process, is, accompanied, by, bubbling, and, emission, of, heat, and, light, by, glassware, due, to, the, absorbed, alpha, particles, as, a, result, polonium, solutions, are, volatile, and, will, evaporate, within, days, unless, sealed, at, ph, about, 1, polonium, ions, are, readily, hydrolyzed, and, complexed, by, acids, such, as, oxalic, acid, citric, acid, and, tartaric, acid, polonium, has, no, common, compounds, and, almost, all, of, its, compounds, are, synthetically, created, more, than, 50, of, those, are, known, the, most, stable, class, of, polonium, compounds, are, polonides, which, are, prepared, by, direct, reaction, of, two, elements, na, 2, po, has, the, antifluorite, structure, the, polonides, of, ca, ba, hg, pb, and, lanthanides, form, a, nacl, lattice, bepo, and, cdpo, have, the, wurtzite, and, mgpo, the, nickel, arsenide, structure, most, polonides, decompose, upon, heating, to, about, 600, c, except, for, hgpo, that, decomposes, at, 300, c, and, the, lanthanide, polonides, which, do, not, decompose, but, melt, at, temperatures, above, 1000, c, for, example, the, polonide, of, praseodymium, prpo, melts, at, 1250, c, and, that, of, thulium, tmpo, melts, at, 2200, c, pbpo, is, one, of, the, very, few, naturally, occurring, polonium, compounds, as, polonium, alpha, decays, to, form, lead, polonium, hydride, poh, 2, is, a, volatile, liquid, at, room, temperature, prone, to, dissociation, it, is, thermally, unstable, water, is, the, only, other, known, hydrogen, chalcogenide, which, is, a, liquid, at, room, temperature, however, this, is, due, to, hydrogen, bonding, the, three, oxides, poo, poo, 2, and, poo, 3, are, the, products, of, oxidation, of, polonium, halides, of, the, structure, pox, 2, pox, 4, and, pof, 6, are, known, they, are, soluble, in, the, corresponding, hydrogen, halides, i, e, pocl, x, in, hcl, pobr, x, in, hbr, and, poi, 4, in, hi, polonium, dihalides, are, formed, by, direct, reaction, of, the, elements, or, by, reduction, of, pocl, 4, with, so, 2, and, with, pobr, 4, with, h, 2, s, at, room, temperature, tetrahalides, can, be, obtained, by, reacting, polonium, dioxide, with, hcl, hbr, or, hi, other, polonium, compounds, include, the, polonite, potassium, polonite, various, polonate, solutions, and, the, acetate, bromate, carbonate, citrate, chromate, cyanide, formate, ii, or, iv, hydroxide, nitrate, selenate, selenite, monosulfide, sulfate, disulfate, or, sulfite, salts, a, limited, organopolonium, chemistry, is, known, mostly, restricted, to, dialkyl, and, diaryl, polonides, r, 2, po, triarylpolonium, halides, ar, 3, pox, and, diarylpolonium, dihalides, ar, 2, pox, 2, polonium, also, forms, soluble, compounds, with, some, chelating, agents, such, as, 2, 3, butanediol, and, thiourea, oxides, hydrides, halides, polonium, has, 42, known, isotopes, all, of, which, are, radioactive, they, have, atomic, masses, that, range, from, 186, to, 227, u, 210, po, half, life, 138, 376, days, is, the, most, widely, available, and, is, made, via, neutron, capture, by, natural, bismuth, the, longer, lived, 209, po, half, life, 124, years, longest, lived, of, all, polonium, isotopes, and, 208, po, half, life, 2, 9, years, can, be, made, through, the, alpha, proton, or, deuteron, bombardment, of, lead, or, bismuth, in, a, cyclotron, tentatively, called, radium, f, polonium, was, discovered, by, marie, and, pierre, curie, in, july, 1898, and, was, named, after, marie, curie, s, native, land, of, poland, latin, polonia, poland, at, the, time, was, under, russian, german, and, austro, hungarian, partition, and, did, not, exist, as, an, independent, country, it, was, curie, s, hope, that, naming, the, element, after, her, native, land, would, publicize, its, lack, of, independence, polonium, may, be, the, first, element, named, to, highlight, a, political, controversy, this, element, was, the, first, one, discovered, by, the, curies, while, they, were, investigating, the, cause, of, pitchblende, radioactivity, pitchblende, after, removal, of, the, radioactive, elements, uranium, and, thorium, was, more, radioactive, than, the, uranium, and, thorium, combined, this, spurred, the, curies, to, search, for, additional, radioactive, elements, they, first, separated, out, polonium, from, pitchblende, in, july, 1898, and, five, months, later, also, isolated, radium, german, scientist, willy, marckwald, successfully, isolated, 3, milligrams, of, polonium, in, 1902, though, at, the, time, he, believed, it, was, a, new, element, which, he, dubbed, radio, tellurium, and, it, was, not, until, 1905, that, it, was, demonstrated, to, be, the, same, as, polonium, in, the, united, states, polonium, was, produced, as, part, of, the, manhattan, project, s, dayton, project, during, world, war, ii, polonium, and, beryllium, were, the, key, ingredients, of, the, urchin, initiator, at, the, center, of, the, bomb, s, spherical, pit, urchin, initiated, the, nuclear, chain, reaction, at, the, moment, of, prompt, criticality, to, ensure, that, the, weapon, did, not, fizzle, urchin, was, used, in, early, u, s, weapons, subsequent, u, s, weapons, utilized, a, pulse, neutron, generator, for, the, same, purpose, much, of, the, basic, physics, of, polonium, was, classified, until, after, the, war, the, fact, that, a, polonium, beryllium, po, be, initiator, was, used, in, the, gun, type, nuclear, weapons, was, classified, until, the, 1960s, the, atomic, energy, commission, and, the, manhattan, project, funded, human, experiments, using, polonium, on, five, people, at, the, university, of, rochester, between, 1943, and, 1947, the, people, were, administered, between, 9, and, 22, microcuries, 330, and, 810, kbq, of, polonium, to, study, its, excretion, polonium, is, a, very, rare, element, in, nature, because, of, the, short, half, lives, of, all, its, isotopes, nine, isotopes, from, 210, to, 218, inclusive, occur, in, traces, as, decay, products, 210, po, 214, po, and, 218, po, occur, in, the, decay, chain, of, 238, u, 211, po, and, 215, po, occur, in, the, decay, chain, of, 235, u, 212, po, and, 216, po, occur, in, the, decay, chain, of, 232, th, and, 213, po, and, 217, po, occur, in, the, decay, chain, of, 237, np, no, primordial, 237, np, survives, but, traces, of, it, are, continuously, regenerated, through, n, 2n, knockout, reactions, in, natural, 238, u, of, these, 210, po, is, the, only, isotope, with, a, half, life, longer, than, 3, minutes, polonium, can, be, found, in, uranium, ores, at, about, 0, 1, mg, per, metric, ton, 1, part, in, 10, 10, which, is, approximately, 0, 2, of, the, abundance, of, radium, the, amounts, in, the, earth, s, crust, are, not, harmful, polonium, has, been, found, in, tobacco, smoke, from, tobacco, leaves, grown, with, phosphate, fertilizers, because, it, is, present, in, small, concentrations, isolation, of, polonium, from, natural, sources, is, a, tedious, process, the, largest, batch, of, the, element, ever, extracted, performed, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, contained, only, 40, ci, 1, 5, tbq, 9, mg, of, polonium, 210, and, was, obtained, by, processing, 37, tonnes, of, residues, from, radium, production, polonium, is, now, usually, obtained, by, irradiating, bismuth, with, high, energy, neutrons, or, protons, in, 1934, an, experiment, showed, that, when, natural, 209, bi, is, bombarded, with, neutrons, 210, bi, is, created, which, then, decays, to, 210, po, via, beta, minus, decay, by, irradiating, certain, bismuth, salts, containing, light, element, nuclei, such, as, beryllium, a, cascading, n, reaction, can, also, be, induced, to, produce, 210, po, in, large, quantities, the, final, purification, is, done, pyrochemically, followed, by, liquid, liquid, extraction, techniques, polonium, may, now, be, made, in, milligram, amounts, in, this, procedure, which, uses, high, neutron, fluxes, found, in, nuclear, reactors, only, about, 100, grams, are, produced, each, year, practically, all, of, it, in, russia, making, polonium, exceedingly, rare, this, process, can, cause, problems, in, lead, bismuth, based, liquid, metal, cooled, nuclear, reactors, such, as, those, used, in, the, soviet, navy, s, k, 27, measures, must, be, taken, in, these, reactors, to, deal, with, the, unwanted, possibility, of, 210, po, being, released, from, the, coolant, the, longer, lived, isotopes, of, polonium, 208, po, and, 209, po, can, be, formed, by, proton, or, deuteron, bombardment, of, bismuth, using, a, cyclotron, other, more, neutron, deficient, and, more, unstable, isotopes, can, be, formed, by, the, irradiation, of, platinum, with, carbon, nuclei, polonium, based, sources, of, alpha, particles, were, produced, in, the, former, soviet, union, such, sources, were, applied, for, measuring, the, thickness, of, industrial, coatings, via, attenuation, of, alpha, radiation, because, of, intense, alpha, radiation, a, one, gram, sample, of, 210, po, will, spontaneously, heat, up, to, above, 500, c, 932, f, generating, about, 140, watts, of, power, therefore, 210, po, is, used, as, an, atomic, heat, source, to, power, radioisotope, thermoelectric, generators, via, thermoelectric, materials, for, example, 210, po, heat, sources, were, used, in, the, lunokhod, 1, 1970, and, lunokhod, 2, 1973, moon, rovers, to, keep, their, internal, components, warm, during, the, lunar, nights, as, well, as, the, kosmos, 84, and, 90, satellites, 1965, the, alpha, particles, emitted, by, polonium, can, be, converted, to, neutrons, using, beryllium, oxide, at, a, rate, of, 93, neutrons, per, million, alpha, particles, po, beo, mixtures, are, used, as, passive, neutron, sources, with, a, gamma, ray, to, neutron, production, ratio, of, 1, 13, 0, 05, lower, than, for, nuclear, fission, based, neutron, sources, examples, of, po, beo, mixtures, or, alloys, used, as, neutron, sources, are, a, neutron, trigger, or, initiator, for, nuclear, weapons, and, for, inspections, of, oil, wells, about, 1500, sources, of, this, type, with, an, individual, activity, of, 1, 850, ci, 68, tbq, had, been, used, annually, in, the, soviet, union, polonium, was, also, part, of, brushes, or, more, complex, tools, that, eliminate, static, charges, in, photographic, plates, textile, mills, paper, rolls, sheet, plastics, and, on, substrates, such, as, automotive, prior, to, the, application, of, coatings, alpha, particles, emitted, by, polonium, ionize, air, molecules, that, neutralize, charges, on, the, nearby, surfaces, some, anti, static, brushes, contain, up, to, 500, microcuries, 20, mbq, of, 210, po, as, a, source, of, charged, particles, for, neutralizing, static, electricity, in, the, us, devices, with, no, more, than, 500, ci, 19, mbq, of, sealed, 210, po, per, unit, can, be, bought, in, any, amount, under, a, general, license, which, means, that, a, buyer, need, not, be, registered, by, any, authorities, polonium, needs, to, be, replaced, in, these, devices, nearly, every, year, because, of, its, short, half, life, it, is, also, highly, radioactive, and, therefore, has, been, mostly, replaced, by, less, dangerous, beta, particle, sources, tiny, amounts, of, 210, po, are, sometimes, used, in, the, laboratory, and, for, teaching, purposes, typically, of, the, order, of, 4, 40, kbq, 0, 11, 1, 08, ci, in, the, form, of, sealed, sources, with, the, polonium, deposited, on, a, substrate, or, in, a, resin, or, polymer, matrix, are, often, exempt, from, licensing, by, the, nrc, and, similar, authorities, as, they, are, not, considered, hazardous, small, amounts, of, 210, po, are, manufactured, for, sale, to, the, public, in, the, united, states, as, needle, sources, for, laboratory, experimentation, and, they, are, retailed, by, scientific, supply, companies, the, polonium, is, a, layer, of, plating, which, in, turn, is, plated, with, a, material, such, as, gold, which, allows, the, alpha, radiation, used, in, experiments, such, as, cloud, chambers, to, pass, while, preventing, the, polonium, from, being, released, and, presenting, a, toxic, hazard, polonium, spark, plugs, were, marketed, by, firestone, from, 1940, to, 1953, while, the, amount, of, radiation, from, the, plugs, was, minuscule, and, not, a, threat, to, the, consumer, the, benefits, of, such, plugs, quickly, diminished, after, approximately, a, month, because, of, polonium, s, short, half, life, and, because, buildup, on, the, conductors, would, block, the, radiation, that, improved, engine, performance, the, premise, behind, the, polonium, spark, plug, as, well, as, alfred, matthew, hubbard, s, prototype, radium, plug, that, preceded, it, was, that, the, radiation, would, improve, ionization, of, the, fuel, in, the, cylinder, and, thus, allow, the, motor, to, fire, more, quickly, and, efficiently, polonium, can, be, hazardous, and, has, no, biological, role, by, mass, polonium, 210, is, around, 250, 000, times, more, toxic, than, hydrogen, cyanide, the, ld, 50, for, 210, po, is, less, than, 1, microgram, for, an, average, adult, see, below, compared, with, about, 250, milligrams, for, hydrogen, cyanide, the, main, hazard, is, its, intense, radioactivity, as, an, alpha, emitter, which, makes, it, difficult, to, handle, safely, even, in, microgram, amounts, handling, 210, po, is, extremely, dangerous, requiring, specialized, equipment, a, negative, pressure, alpha, glove, box, equipped, with, high, performance, filters, adequate, monitoring, and, strict, handling, procedures, to, avoid, any, contamination, alpha, particles, emitted, by, polonium, will, damage, organic, tissue, easily, if, polonium, is, ingested, inhaled, or, absorbed, although, they, do, not, penetrate, the, epidermis, and, hence, are, not, hazardous, as, long, as, the, alpha, particles, remain, outside, the, body, and, do, not, come, near, the, eyes, which, are, living, tissue, wearing, chemically, resistant, and, intact, gloves, is, a, mandatory, precaution, to, avoid, transcutaneous, diffusion, of, polonium, directly, through, the, skin, polonium, delivered, in, concentrated, nitric, acid, can, easily, diffuse, through, inadequate, gloves, e, g, latex, gloves, or, the, acid, may, damage, the, gloves, polonium, does, not, have, toxic, chemical, properties, it, has, been, reported, that, some, microbes, can, methylate, polonium, by, the, action, of, methylcobalamin, this, is, similar, to, the, way, in, which, mercury, selenium, and, tellurium, are, methylated, in, living, things, to, create, organometallic, compounds, studies, investigating, the, metabolism, of, polonium, 210, in, rats, have, shown, that, only, 0, 002, to, 0, 009, of, polonium, 210, ingested, is, excreted, as, volatile, polonium, 210, the, median, lethal, dose, ld, 50, for, acute, radiation, exposure, is, about, 4, 5, sv, the, committed, effective, dose, equivalent, 210, po, is, 0, 51, sv, bq, if, ingested, and, 2, 5, sv, bq, if, inhaled, a, fatal, 4, 5, sv, dose, can, be, caused, by, ingesting, 8, 8, mbq, 240, ci, about, 50, nanograms, ng, or, inhaling, 1, 8, mbq, 49, ci, about, 10, ng, one, gram, of, 210, po, could, thus, in, theory, poison, 20, million, people, of, whom, 10, million, would, die, the, actual, toxicity, of, 210, po, is, lower, than, these, estimates, because, radiation, exposure, that, is, spread, out, over, several, weeks, the, biological, half, life, of, polonium, in, humans, is, 30, to, 50, days, is, somewhat, less, damaging, than, an, instantaneous, dose, it, has, been, estimated, that, a, median, lethal, dose, of, 210, po, is, 15, megabecquerels, 0, 41, mci, or, 0, 089, micrograms, g, still, an, extremely, small, amount, for, comparison, one, grain, of, table, salt, is, about, 0, 06, mg, 60, g, in, addition, to, the, acute, effects, radiation, exposure, both, internal, and, external, carries, a, long, term, risk, of, death, from, cancer, of, 5, 10, per, sv, the, general, population, is, exposed, to, small, amounts, of, polonium, as, a, radon, daughter, in, indoor, air, the, isotopes, 214, po, and, 218, po, are, thought, to, cause, the, majority, of, the, estimated, 15, 000, 22, 000, lung, cancer, deaths, in, the, us, every, year, that, have, been, attributed, to, indoor, radon, tobacco, smoking, causes, additional, exposure, to, polonium, the, maximum, allowable, body, burden, for, ingested, 210, po, is, only, 1, 1, kbq, 30, nci, which, is, equivalent, to, a, particle, massing, only, 6, 8, picograms, the, maximum, permissible, workplace, concentration, of, airborne, 210, po, is, about, 10, bq, m, 3, 3, 10, 10, ci, cm, 3, the, target, organs, for, polonium, in, humans, are, the, spleen, and, liver, as, the, spleen, 150, g, and, the, liver, 1, 3, to, 3, kg, are, much, smaller, than, the, rest, of, the, body, if, the, polonium, is, concentrated, in, these, vital, organs, it, is, a, greater, threat, to, life, than, the, dose, which, would, be, suffered, on, average, by, the, whole, body, if, it, were, spread, evenly, throughout, the, body, in, the, same, way, as, caesium, or, tritium, as, t, 2, o, 210, po, is, widely, used, in, industry, and, readily, available, with, little, regulation, or, restriction, in, the, us, a, tracking, system, run, by, the, nuclear, regulatory, commission, was, implemented, in, 2007, to, register, purchases, of, more, than, 16, curies, 590, gbq, of, polonium, 210, enough, to, make, up, 5, 000, lethal, doses, the, iaea, is, said, to, be, considering, tighter, regulations, there, is, talk, that, it, might, tighten, the, polonium, reporting, requirement, by, a, factor, of, 10, to, 1, 6, curies, 59, gbq, as, of, 2013, this, is, still, the, only, alpha, emitting, byproduct, material, available, as, a, nrc, exempt, quantity, which, may, be, held, without, a, radioactive, material, license, polonium, and, its, compounds, must, be, handled, with, caution, inside, special, alpha, glove, boxes, equipped, with, hepa, filters, and, continuously, maintained, under, depression, to, prevent, the, radioactive, materials, from, leaking, out, gloves, made, of, natural, rubber, latex, do, not, properly, withstand, chemical, attacks, a, o, by, concentrated, nitric, acid, e, g, 6, m, hno, 3, commonly, used, to, keep, polonium, in, solution, while, minimizing, its, sorption, onto, glass, they, do, not, provide, sufficient, protection, against, the, contamination, from, polonium, diffusion, of, 210, po, solution, through, the, intact, latex, membrane, or, worse, direct, contact, through, tiny, holes, and, cracks, produced, when, the, latex, begins, to, suffer, degradation, by, acids, or, uv, from, ambient, light, additional, surgical, gloves, are, necessary, inside, the, glovebox, to, protect, the, main, gloves, when, handling, strong, acids, and, bases, and, also, from, outside, to, protect, the, operator, hands, against, 210, po, contamination, from, diffusion, or, direct, contact, through, glove, defects, chemically, more, resistant, and, also, denser, neoprene, and, butyl, gloves, shield, alpha, particles, emitted, by, polonium, better, than, natural, rubber, the, use, of, natural, rubber, gloves, is, not, recommended, for, handling, 210, po, solutions, despite, the, element, s, highly, hazardous, properties, circumstances, in, which, polonium, poisoning, can, occur, are, rare, its, extreme, scarcity, in, nature, the, short, half, lives, of, all, its, isotopes, the, specialised, facilities, and, equipment, needed, to, obtain, any, significant, quantity, and, safety, precautions, against, laboratory, accidents, all, make, harmful, exposure, events, unlikely, as, such, only, a, handful, of, cases, of, radiation, poisoning, specifically, attributable, to, polonium, exposure, have, been, confirmed, in, response, to, concerns, about, the, risks, of, occupational, polonium, exposure, quantities, of, 210, po, were, administered, to, five, human, volunteers, at, the, university, of, rochester, from, 1944, to, 1947, in, order, to, study, its, biological, behaviour, these, studies, were, funded, by, the, manhattan, project, and, the, aec, four, men, and, a, woman, participated, all, suffering, from, terminal, cancers, and, ranged, in, age, from, their, early, thirties, to, early, forties, all, were, chosen, because, experimenters, wanted, subjects, who, had, not, been, exposed, to, polonium, either, through, work, or, accident, 210, po, was, injected, into, four, hospitalised, patients, and, orally, given, to, a, fifth, none, of, the, administered, doses, all, ranging, from, 0, 17, to, 0, 30, ci, kg, 1, approached, fatal, quantities, the, first, documented, death, directly, resulting, from, polonium, poisoning, occurred, in, the, soviet, union, on, 10, july, 1954, an, unidentified, 41, year, old, man, presented, for, medical, treatment, on, 29, june, with, severe, vomiting, and, fever, the, previous, day, he, had, been, working, for, five, hours, in, an, area, in, which, unknown, to, him, a, capsule, containing, 210, po, had, depressurised, and, begun, to, disperse, in, aerosol, form, over, this, period, his, total, intake, of, airborne, 210, po, was, estimated, at, 0, 11, gbq, almost, 25, times, the, estimated, ld, 50, by, inhalation, of, 4, 5, mbq, despite, treatment, his, condition, continued, to, worsen, and, he, died, 13, days, after, the, exposure, event, from, 1955, to, 1957, the, windscale, piles, had, been, releasing, polonium, 210, the, windscale, fire, brought, the, need, for, testing, of, the, land, downwind, for, radioactive, material, contamination, and, this, is, how, it, was, found, an, estimate, of, 8, 8, terabecquerels, 240, ci, of, polonium, 210, has, been, made, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, ir, ne, joliot, curie, s, 1956, death, from, leukaemia, was, owed, to, the, radiation, effects, of, polonium, she, was, accidentally, exposed, in, 1946, when, a, sealed, capsule, of, the, element, exploded, on, her, laboratory, bench, as, well, several, deaths, in, israel, during, 1957, 1969, have, been, alleged, to, have, resulted, from, 210, po, exposure, a, leak, was, discovered, at, a, weizmann, institute, laboratory, in, 1957, traces, of, 210, po, were, found, on, the, hands, of, professor, dror, sadeh, a, physicist, who, researched, radioactive, materials, medical, tests, indicated, no, harm, but, the, tests, did, not, include, bone, marrow, sadeh, one, of, his, students, and, two, colleagues, died, from, various, cancers, over, the, subsequent, few, years, the, issue, was, investigated, secretly, but, there, was, never, any, formal, admission, of, a, connection, between, the, leak, and, the, deaths, the, church, rock, uranium, mill, spill, july, 16, 1979, is, reported, to, have, released, polonium, 210, the, report, states, animals, had, higher, concentrations, of, lead, 210, polonium, 210, and, radium, 226, than, the, tissues, from, control, animals, the, cause, of, the, 2006, death, of, alexander, litvinenko, a, former, russian, fsb, agent, who, had, defected, to, the, united, kingdom, in, 2001, was, identified, to, be, poisoning, with, a, lethal, dose, of, 210, po, it, was, subsequently, determined, that, the, 210, po, had, probably, been, deliberately, administered, to, him, by, two, russian, ex, security, agents, andrey, lugovoy, and, dmitry, kovtun, as, such, litvinenko, s, death, was, the, first, and, to, date, only, confirmed, instance, in, which, polonium, s, extreme, toxicity, has, been, used, with, malicious, intent, in, 2011, an, allegation, surfaced, that, the, death, of, palestinian, leader, yasser, arafat, who, died, on, 11, november, 2004, of, uncertain, causes, also, resulted, from, deliberate, polonium, poisoning, and, in, july, 2012, concentrations, of, 210, po, many, times, more, than, normal, were, detected, in, arafat, s, clothes, and, personal, belongings, by, the, institut, de, radiophysique, in, lausanne, switzerland, even, though, arafat, s, symptoms, were, acute, gastroenteritis, with, diarrhoea, and, vomiting, the, institute, s, spokesman, said, that, despite, the, tests, the, symptoms, described, in, arafat, s, medical, reports, were, not, consistent, with, 210, po, poisoning, and, conclusions, could, not, be, drawn, in, 2013, the, team, found, levels, of, polonium, in, arafat, s, ribs, and, pelvis, 18, to, 36, times, the, average, even, though, by, this, point, in, time, the, amount, had, diminished, by, a, factor, of, 2, million, forensic, scientist, dave, barclay, stated, in, my, opinion, it, is, absolutely, certain, that, the, cause, of, his, illness, was, polonium, poisoning, what, we, have, got, is, the, smoking, gun, the, thing, that, caused, his, illness, and, was, given, to, him, with, malice, subsequently, french, and, russian, teams, claimed, that, the, elevated, 210, po, levels, were, not, the, result, of, deliberate, poisoning, and, did, not, cause, arafat, s, death, it, has, also, been, suspected, that, russian, businessman, roman, tsepov, was, killed, with, polonium, he, had, symptoms, similar, to, aleksander, litvinenko, it, has, been, suggested, that, chelation, agents, such, as, british, anti, lewisite, dimercaprol, can, be, used, to, decontaminate, humans, in, one, experiment, rats, were, given, a, fatal, dose, of, 1, 45, mbq, kg, 8, 7, ng, kg, of, 210, po, all, untreated, rats, were, dead, after, 44, days, but, 90, of, the, rats, treated, with, the, chelation, agent, hoetttc, remained, alive, for, five, months, polonium, 210, may, be, quantified, in, biological, specimens, by, alpha, particle, spectrometry, to, confirm, a, diagnosis, of, poisoning, in, hospitalized, patients, or, to, provide, evidence, in, a, medicolegal, death, investigation, the, baseline, urinary, excretion, of, polonium, 210, in, healthy, persons, due, to, routine, exposure, to, environmental, sources, is, normally, in, a, range, of, 5, 15, mbq, day, levels, in, excess, of, 30, mbq, day, are, suggestive, of, excessive, exposure, to, the, radionuclide, polonium, 210, is, widespread, in, the, biosphere, including, in, human, tissues, because, of, its, position, in, the, uranium, 238, decay, chain, natural, uranium, 238, in, the, earth, s, crust, decays, through, a, series, of, solid, radioactive, intermediates, including, radium, 226, to, the, radioactive, noble, gas, radon, 222, some, of, which, during, its, 3, 8, day, half, life, diffuses, into, the, atmosphere, there, it, decays, through, several, more, steps, to, polonium, 210, much, of, which, during, its, 138, day, half, life, is, washed, back, down, to, the, earth, s, surface, thus, entering, the, biosphere, before, finally, decaying, to, stable, lead, 206, as, early, as, the, 1920s, french, biologist, antoine, lacassagne, using, polonium, provided, by, his, colleague, marie, curie, showed, that, the, element, has, a, specific, pattern, of, uptake, in, rabbit, tissues, with, high, concentrations, particularly, in, liver, kidney, and, testes, more, recent, evidence, suggests, that, this, behavior, results, from, polonium, substituting, for, its, congener, sulfur, also, in, group, 16, of, the, periodic, table, in, sulfur, containing, amino, acids, or, related, molecules, and, that, similar, patterns, of, distribution, occur, in, human, tissues, polonium, is, indeed, an, element, naturally, present, in, all, humans, contributing, appreciably, to, natural, background, dose, with, wide, geographical, and, cultural, variations, and, particularly, high, levels, in, arctic, residents, for, example, polonium, 210, in, tobacco, contributes, to, many, of, the, cases, of, lung, cancer, worldwide, most, of, this, polonium, is, derived, from, lead, 210, deposited, on, tobacco, leaves, from, the, atmosphere, the, lead, 210, is, a, product, of, radon, 222, gas, much, of, which, appears, to, originate, from, the, decay, of, radium, 226, from, fertilizers, applied, to, the, tobacco, soils, the, presence, of, polonium, in, tobacco, smoke, has, been, known, since, the, early, 1960s, some, of, the, world, s, biggest, tobacco, firms, researched, ways, to, remove, the, substance, to, no, avail, over, a, 40, year, period, the, results, were, never, published, polonium, is, found, in, the, food, chain, especially, in, seafood
