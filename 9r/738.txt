tropical, climate, is, the, first, of, the, five, major, climate, groups, in, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, identified, with, the, letter, a, tropical, climates, are, defined, by, a, monthly, average, temperature, of, 18, c, 64, f, or, higher, in, the, coolest, month, featuring, hot, temperatures, and, high, humidity, all, year, round, annual, precipitation, is, often, abundant, in, tropical, climates, and, shows, a, seasonal, rhythm, but, may, have, seasonal, dryness, to, varying, degrees, there, are, normally, only, two, seasons, in, tropical, climates, a, wet, rainy, monsoon, season, and, a, dry, season, the, annual, temperature, range, in, tropical, climates, is, normally, very, small, sunlight, is, intense, in, these, climates, there, are, three, basic, types, of, tropical, climates, within, the, tropical, climate, group, tropical, rainforest, climate, af, tropical, monsoon, climate, am, and, tropical, savanna, or, tropical, wet, and, dry, climate, aw, for, dry, winters, and, as, for, dry, summers, which, are, classified, and, distinguished, by, the, precipitation, and, the, precipitation, levels, of, the, driest, month, in, those, regions, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, is, one, of, the, most, widely, used, climate, classification, systems, it, defines, a, tropical, climate, as, a, region, where, the, mean, temperature, of, the, coldest, month, is, greater, than, or, equal, to, 18, c, 64, f, and, does, not, fit, into, the, criteria, for, b, group, climates, classifying, them, as, an, a, group, tropical, climate, group, a, group, regions, are, usually, found, in, the, tropics, below, 23, 5, latitude, in, both, the, southern, and, northern, hemisphere, they, include, areas, around, the, equator, central, america, north, central, portions, of, south, america, central, africa, southern, portions, of, asia, and, parts, of, north, australia, and, the, pacific, ocean, islands, in, group, a, there, are, three, types, of, this, climate, the, tropical, rainforest, climate, af, tropical, monsoon, climate, am, and, tropical, wet, and, dry, or, savanna, climate, aw, or, as, all, of, the, three, climates, are, classified, by, their, p, dry, short, for, precipitation, of, the, driest, month, tropical, rainforest, climate, s, p, dry, should, be, greater, than, or, equal, 60, mm, 2, 4, in, tropical, monsoon, climate, s, p, dry, should, be, in, the, range, from, 100, m, e, a, n, a, n, n, u, a, l, p, r, e, c, i, p, i, t, a, t, i, o, n, i, n, m, m, 25, displaystyle, 100, tfrac, mean, annual, precipitation, in, mm, 25, to, 60, mm, tropical, wet, and, dry, or, savanna, climate, s, p, dry, should, be, less, than, 100, m, e, a, n, a, n, n, u, a, l, p, r, e, c, i, p, i, t, a, t, i, o, n, i, n, m, m, 25, displaystyle, 100, tfrac, mean, annual, precipitation, in, mm, 25, tropical, climates, normally, have, only, two, seasons, a, wet, season, and, a, dry, season, depending, on, the, location, of, the, region, the, wet, and, dry, seasons, can, have, varying, duration, annual, temperature, changes, in, the, tropics, are, small, due, to, the, high, temperatures, and, abundant, rainfall, much, of, the, plant, life, grows, throughout, the, year, high, temperature, and, humidity, is, the, most, suitable, environment, for, epiphytes, to, grow, in, many, tropical, climates, vegetation, grow, in, layers, shrubs, under, tall, trees, bushes, under, shrubs, and, grasses, under, bushes, tropical, plants, are, rich, in, resources, including, coffee, cocoa, and, oil, palm, listed, below, are, the, types, of, vegetation, unique, to, each, of, the, three, climates, that, make, up, the, tropical, climate, biome, tropical, rainforest, vegetation, including, bengal, bamboo, bougainvillea, curare, coconut, tree, durian, and, banana, tropical, monsoon, vegetation, including, teak, deodar, rosewood, sandalwood, and, bamboo, tropical, wet, and, dry, or, savanna, vegetation, including, acacia, senegal, elephant, grass, jarrah, tree, gum, tree, eucalyptus, and, whistling, thorn, the, k, ppen, classification, identifies, tropical, rainforest, climates, zone, af, f, feucht, german, for, moist, as, usually, having, north, and, south, latitudinal, ranges, of, just, 5, 10, degrees, from, the, equator, tropical, rainforest, climates, have, high, temperatures, the, yearly, average, temperature, is, normally, between, 21, and, 30, c, 70, and, 86, f, the, precipitation, can, reach, over, 100, inches, a, year, the, seasons, are, evenly, distributed, throughout, the, year, and, there, is, almost, no, drought, period, here, regions, that, contain, tropical, rainforest, climate, mainly, include, the, upper, amazon, basin, of, south, america, the, northern, zaire, congo, basin, of, africa, and, the, islands, of, the, east, indies, the, tropical, rainforest, climate, differs, from, other, subtypes, of, tropical, climates, as, it, has, more, kinds, of, trees, due, to, its, precipitation, the, large, number, of, trees, contribute, back, to, the, humidity, of, the, climate, because, of, the, transpiration, which, is, the, process, of, water, evaporated, from, the, surface, of, living, plants, to, the, atmosphere, the, warmth, and, abundant, precipitation, heavily, contributes, to, the, diversity, and, characteristics, of, vegetations, under, the, tropical, rainforest, climate, the, vegetations, develop, a, vertical, stratification, and, various, growth, forms, to, receive, enough, sunlight, which, is, unusual, under, other, types, of, climate, the, k, ppen, classification, tool, identifies, tropical, monsoon, climate, as, having, small, annual, temperature, ranges, high, temperatures, and, plentiful, precipitation, this, climate, also, has, a, short, dry, season, which, almost, always, occurs, in, the, winter, the, tropical, monsoon, climate, is, often, found, within, countries, in, the, south, and, southeast, asia, region, between, the, latitude, of, 10, degrees, north, and, the, tropic, of, cancer, it, can, also, be, found, in, west, africa, and, south, america, the, annual, temperature, of, regions, under, tropical, monsoon, climate, is, also, stable, the, tropical, monsoon, climate, has, the, following, main, characteristic, the, average, annual, temperature, is, around, 27, 05, c, 80, 69, f, and, has, an, average, annual, temperature, range, of, about, 3, 6, c, 38, 5, f, distinction, between, wet, and, drought, seasons, the, tropical, monsoon, climate, is, different, from, other, tropical, climates, because, of, its, uneven, precipitation, throughout, the, year, there, are, three, main, seasons, of, tropical, monsoon, climate, the, cool, dry, season, is, from, fall, to, late, winter, the, hot, dry, season, is, in, the, spring, and, the, rainy, or, monsoon, season, is, near, or, during, the, summer, months, the, tropical, monsoon, forest, mainly, consists, of, three, layered, structures, the, first, layer, is, the, surface, layer, which, is, a, very, dense, layer, of, shrubs, and, grasses, the, second, layer, is, the, understory, layer, with, trees, about, 15, meters, tall, the, top, layer, is, called, the, canopy, tree, layer, which, has, trees, from, 25, to, 40, meters, tall, and, those, trees, grow, closely, while, above, is, the, emergent, layer, with, sporadic, trees, taller, than, 35, meters, tropical, savanna, climates, or, tropical, wet, and, dry, climates, are, mainly, located, between, the, 10, and, 25, north, south, latitudes, and, often, occur, at, the, outer, margins, of, the, tropics, typical, regions, include, central, africa, parts, of, south, america, as, well, as, northern, and, eastern, australia, the, temperature, range, of, savanna, climate, is, between, 20, and, 30, c, 68, and, 86, f, in, summer, the, temperature, is, between, 25, c, and, 30, c, while, in, winter, the, temperature, is, between, 20, c, and, 30, c, but, still, stays, above, an, 18, c, mean, the, annual, precipitation, is, between, 700, and, 1000, mm, the, driest, months, are, generally, in, the, winter, and, they, have, less, than, 60, mm, of, rainfall, often, much, less, regions, under, the, savanna, climate, usually, have, lands, covered, with, flat, grassland, vegetation, with, areas, of, woodlands, those, grassland, biomes, cover, almost, 20, of, the, earth, s, surface, the, grassland, vegetation, types, include, rhodes, grass, red, oats, grass, star, grass, and, lemongrass
