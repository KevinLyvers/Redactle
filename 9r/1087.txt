https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light
the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, commonly, denoted, c, is, a, universal, physical, constant, that, is, exactly, equal, to, 299, 792, 458, metres, per, second, approximately, 300, 000, kilometres, per, second, 186, 000, miles, per, second, 671, million, miles, per, hour, according, to, the, special, theory, of, relativity, c, is, the, upper, limit, for, the, speed, at, which, conventional, matter, or, energy, and, thus, any, signal, carrying, information, can, travel, through, space, all, forms, of, electromagnetic, radiation, including, visible, light, travel, at, the, speed, of, light, for, many, practical, purposes, light, and, other, electromagnetic, waves, will, appear, to, propagate, instantaneously, but, for, long, distances, and, very, sensitive, measurements, their, finite, speed, has, noticeable, effects, much, starlight, viewed, on, earth, is, from, the, distant, past, allowing, humans, to, study, the, history, of, the, universe, by, viewing, distant, objects, when, communicating, with, distant, space, probes, it, can, take, minutes, to, hours, for, signals, to, travel, in, computing, the, speed, of, light, fixes, the, ultimate, minimum, communication, delay, the, speed, of, light, can, be, used, in, time, of, flight, measurements, to, measure, large, distances, to, extremely, high, precision, ole, r, mer, first, demonstrated, in, 1676, that, light, does, not, travel, instantaneously, by, studying, the, apparent, motion, of, jupiter, s, moon, io, progressively, more, accurate, measurements, of, its, speed, came, over, the, following, centuries, in, a, paper, published, in, 1865, james, clerk, maxwell, proposed, that, light, was, an, electromagnetic, wave, and, therefore, travelled, at, speed, c, in, 1905, albert, einstein, postulated, that, the, speed, of, light, c, with, respect, to, any, inertial, frame, of, reference, is, a, constant, and, is, independent, of, the, motion, of, the, light, source, he, explored, the, consequences, of, that, postulate, by, deriving, the, theory, of, relativity, and, in, doing, so, showed, that, the, parameter, c, had, relevance, outside, of, the, context, of, light, and, electromagnetism, massless, particles, and, field, perturbations, such, as, gravitational, waves, also, travel, at, speed, c, in, vacuum, such, particles, and, waves, travel, at, c, regardless, of, the, motion, of, the, source, or, the, inertial, reference, frame, of, the, observer, particles, with, nonzero, rest, mass, can, be, accelerated, to, approach, c, but, can, never, reach, it, regardless, of, the, frame, of, reference, in, which, their, speed, is, measured, in, the, theory, of, relativity, c, interrelates, space, and, time, and, appears, in, the, famous, mass, energy, equivalence, e, mc, 2, in, some, cases, objects, or, waves, may, appear, to, travel, faster, than, light, e, g, phase, velocities, of, waves, the, appearance, of, certain, high, speed, astronomical, objects, and, particular, quantum, effects, the, expansion, of, the, universe, is, understood, to, exceed, the, speed, of, light, beyond, a, certain, boundary, the, speed, at, which, light, propagates, through, transparent, materials, such, as, glass, or, air, is, less, than, c, similarly, the, speed, of, electromagnetic, waves, in, wire, cables, is, slower, than, c, the, ratio, between, c, and, the, speed, v, at, which, light, travels, in, a, material, is, called, the, refractive, index, n, of, the, material, n, c, v, for, example, for, visible, light, the, refractive, index, of, glass, is, typically, around, 1, 5, meaning, that, light, in, glass, travels, at, c, 1, 5, 200, 000, km, s, 124, 000, mi, s, the, refractive, index, of, air, for, visible, light, is, about, 1, 0003, so, the, speed, of, light, in, air, is, about, 90, km, s, 56, mi, s, slower, than, c, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, is, usually, denoted, by, a, lowercase, c, for, constant, or, the, latin, celeritas, meaning, swiftness, celerity, in, 1856, wilhelm, eduard, weber, and, rudolf, kohlrausch, had, used, c, for, a, different, constant, that, was, later, shown, to, equal, 2, times, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, historically, the, symbol, v, was, used, as, an, alternative, symbol, for, the, speed, of, light, introduced, by, james, clerk, maxwell, in, 1865, in, 1894, paul, drude, redefined, c, with, its, modern, meaning, einstein, used, v, in, his, original, german, language, papers, on, special, relativity, in, 1905, but, in, 1907, he, switched, to, c, which, by, then, had, become, the, standard, symbol, for, the, speed, of, light, sometimes, c, is, used, for, the, speed, of, waves, in, any, material, medium, and, c, 0, for, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, this, subscripted, notation, which, is, endorsed, in, official, si, literature, has, the, same, form, as, related, electromagnetic, constants, namely, 0, for, the, vacuum, permeability, or, magnetic, constant, 0, for, the, vacuum, permittivity, or, electric, constant, and, z, 0, for, the, impedance, of, free, space, this, article, uses, c, exclusively, for, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, since, 1983, the, constant, c, has, been, defined, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, as, exactly, 299, 792, 458, m, s, this, relationship, is, used, to, define, the, metre, as, exactly, the, distance, that, light, travels, in, vacuum, in, 1, 299, 792, 458, of, a, second, by, using, the, value, of, c, as, well, as, an, accurate, measurement, of, the, second, one, can, thus, establish, a, standard, for, the, metre, as, a, dimensional, physical, constant, the, numerical, value, of, c, is, different, for, different, unit, systems, for, example, in, imperial, units, the, speed, of, light, is, approximately, 186, 282, miles, per, second, or, roughly, 1, foot, per, nanosecond, in, branches, of, physics, in, which, c, appears, often, such, as, in, relativity, it, is, common, to, use, systems, of, natural, units, of, measurement, or, the, geometrized, unit, system, where, c, 1, using, these, units, c, does, not, appear, explicitly, because, multiplication, or, division, by, 1, does, not, affect, the, result, its, unit, of, light, second, per, second, is, still, relevant, even, if, omitted, the, speed, at, which, light, waves, propagate, in, vacuum, is, independent, both, of, the, motion, of, the, wave, source, and, of, the, inertial, frame, of, reference, of, the, observer, this, invariance, of, the, speed, of, light, was, postulated, by, einstein, in, 1905, after, being, motivated, by, maxwell, s, theory, of, electromagnetism, and, the, lack, of, evidence, for, motion, against, the, luminiferous, aether, it, has, since, been, consistently, confirmed, by, many, experiments, it, is, only, possible, to, verify, experimentally, that, the, two, way, speed, of, light, for, example, from, a, source, to, a, mirror, and, back, again, is, frame, independent, because, it, is, impossible, to, measure, the, one, way, speed, of, light, for, example, from, a, source, to, a, distant, detector, without, some, convention, as, to, how, clocks, at, the, source, and, at, the, detector, should, be, synchronized, by, adopting, einstein, synchronization, for, the, clocks, the, one, way, speed, of, light, becomes, equal, to, the, two, way, speed, of, light, by, definition, the, special, theory, of, relativity, explores, the, consequences, of, this, invariance, of, c, with, the, assumption, that, the, laws, of, physics, are, the, same, in, all, inertial, frames, of, reference, one, consequence, is, that, c, is, the, speed, at, which, all, massless, particles, and, waves, including, light, must, travel, in, vacuum, special, relativity, has, many, counterintuitive, and, experimentally, verified, implications, these, include, the, equivalence, of, mass, and, energy, e, mc, 2, length, contraction, moving, objects, shorten, and, time, dilation, moving, clocks, run, more, slowly, the, factor, by, which, lengths, contract, and, times, dilate, is, known, as, the, lorentz, factor, and, is, given, by, 1, v, 2, c, 2, 1, 2, where, v, is, the, speed, of, the, object, the, difference, of, from, 1, is, negligible, for, speeds, much, slower, than, c, such, as, most, everyday, speeds, in, which, case, special, relativity, is, closely, approximated, by, galilean, relativity, but, it, increases, at, relativistic, speeds, and, diverges, to, infinity, as, v, approaches, c, for, example, a, time, dilation, factor, of, 2, occurs, at, a, relative, velocity, of, 86, 6, of, the, speed, of, light, v, 0, 866, c, similarly, a, time, dilation, factor, of, 10, occurs, at, 99, 5, the, speed, of, light, v, 0, 995, c, the, results, of, special, relativity, can, be, summarized, by, treating, space, and, time, as, a, unified, structure, known, as, spacetime, with, c, relating, the, units, of, space, and, time, and, requiring, that, physical, theories, satisfy, a, special, symmetry, called, lorentz, invariance, whose, mathematical, formulation, contains, the, parameter, c, lorentz, invariance, is, an, almost, universal, assumption, for, modern, physical, theories, such, as, quantum, electrodynamics, quantum, chromodynamics, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, and, general, relativity, as, such, the, parameter, c, is, ubiquitous, in, modern, physics, appearing, in, many, contexts, that, are, unrelated, to, light, for, example, general, relativity, predicts, that, c, is, also, the, speed, of, gravity, and, of, gravitational, waves, and, observations, of, gravitational, waves, have, been, consistent, with, this, prediction, in, non, inertial, frames, of, reference, gravitationally, curved, spacetime, or, accelerated, reference, frames, the, local, speed, of, light, is, constant, and, equal, to, c, but, the, speed, of, light, can, differ, from, c, when, measured, from, a, remote, frame, of, reference, depending, on, how, measurements, are, extrapolated, to, the, region, it, is, generally, assumed, that, fundamental, constants, such, as, c, have, the, same, value, throughout, spacetime, meaning, that, they, do, not, depend, on, location, and, do, not, vary, with, time, however, it, has, been, suggested, in, various, theories, that, the, speed, of, light, may, have, changed, over, time, no, conclusive, evidence, for, such, changes, has, been, found, but, they, remain, the, subject, of, ongoing, research, it, is, generally, assumed, that, the, two, way, speed, of, light, is, isotropic, meaning, that, it, has, the, same, value, regardless, of, the, direction, in, which, it, is, measured, observations, of, the, emissions, from, nuclear, energy, levels, as, a, function, of, the, orientation, of, the, emitting, nuclei, in, a, magnetic, field, see, hughes, drever, experiment, and, of, rotating, optical, resonators, see, resonator, experiments, have, put, stringent, limits, on, the, possible, two, way, anisotropy, according, to, special, relativity, the, energy, of, an, object, with, rest, mass, m, and, speed, v, is, given, by, mc, 2, where, is, the, lorentz, factor, defined, above, when, v, is, zero, is, equal, to, one, giving, rise, to, the, famous, e, mc, 2, formula, for, mass, energy, equivalence, the, factor, approaches, infinity, as, v, approaches, c, and, it, would, take, an, infinite, amount, of, energy, to, accelerate, an, object, with, mass, to, the, speed, of, light, the, speed, of, light, is, the, upper, limit, for, the, speeds, of, objects, with, positive, rest, mass, and, individual, photons, cannot, travel, faster, than, the, speed, of, light, this, is, experimentally, established, in, many, tests, of, relativistic, energy, and, momentum, more, generally, it, is, impossible, for, signals, or, energy, to, travel, faster, than, c, one, argument, for, this, follows, from, the, counter, intuitive, implication, of, special, relativity, known, as, the, relativity, of, simultaneity, if, the, spatial, distance, between, two, events, a, and, b, is, greater, than, the, time, interval, between, them, multiplied, by, c, then, there, are, frames, of, reference, in, which, a, precedes, b, others, in, which, b, precedes, a, and, others, in, which, they, are, simultaneous, as, a, result, if, something, were, travelling, faster, than, c, relative, to, an, inertial, frame, of, reference, it, would, be, travelling, backwards, in, time, relative, to, another, frame, and, causality, would, be, violated, in, such, a, frame, of, reference, an, effect, could, be, observed, before, its, cause, such, a, violation, of, causality, has, never, been, recorded, and, would, lead, to, paradoxes, such, as, the, tachyonic, antitelephone, there, are, situations, in, which, it, may, seem, that, matter, energy, or, information, carrying, signal, travels, at, speeds, greater, than, c, but, they, do, not, for, example, as, is, discussed, in, the, propagation, of, light, in, a, medium, section, below, many, wave, velocities, can, exceed, c, the, phase, velocity, of, x, rays, through, most, glasses, can, routinely, exceed, c, but, phase, velocity, does, not, determine, the, velocity, at, which, waves, convey, information, if, a, laser, beam, is, swept, quickly, across, a, distant, object, the, spot, of, light, can, move, faster, than, c, although, the, initial, movement, of, the, spot, is, delayed, because, of, the, time, it, takes, light, to, get, to, the, distant, object, at, the, speed, c, however, the, only, physical, entities, that, are, moving, are, the, laser, and, its, emitted, light, which, travels, at, the, speed, c, from, the, laser, to, the, various, positions, of, the, spot, similarly, a, shadow, projected, onto, a, distant, object, can, be, made, to, move, faster, than, c, after, a, delay, in, time, in, neither, case, does, any, matter, energy, or, information, travel, faster, than, light, the, rate, of, change, in, the, distance, between, two, objects, in, a, frame, of, reference, with, respect, to, which, both, are, moving, their, closing, speed, may, have, a, value, in, excess, of, c, however, this, does, not, represent, the, speed, of, any, single, object, as, measured, in, a, single, inertial, frame, certain, quantum, effects, appear, to, be, transmitted, instantaneously, and, therefore, faster, than, c, as, in, the, epr, paradox, an, example, involves, the, quantum, states, of, two, particles, that, can, be, entangled, until, either, of, the, particles, is, observed, they, exist, in, a, superposition, of, two, quantum, states, if, the, particles, are, separated, and, one, particle, s, quantum, state, is, observed, the, other, particle, s, quantum, state, is, determined, instantaneously, however, it, is, impossible, to, control, which, quantum, state, the, first, particle, will, take, on, when, it, is, observed, so, information, cannot, be, transmitted, in, this, manner, another, quantum, effect, that, predicts, the, occurrence, of, faster, than, light, speeds, is, called, the, hartman, effect, under, certain, conditions, the, time, needed, for, a, virtual, particle, to, tunnel, through, a, barrier, is, constant, regardless, of, the, thickness, of, the, barrier, this, could, result, in, a, virtual, particle, crossing, a, large, gap, faster, than, light, however, no, information, can, be, sent, using, this, effect, so, called, superluminal, motion, is, seen, in, certain, astronomical, objects, such, as, the, relativistic, jets, of, radio, galaxies, and, quasars, however, these, jets, are, not, moving, at, speeds, in, excess, of, the, speed, of, light, the, apparent, superluminal, motion, is, a, projection, effect, caused, by, objects, moving, near, the, speed, of, light, and, approaching, earth, at, a, small, angle, to, the, line, of, sight, since, the, light, which, was, emitted, when, the, jet, was, farther, away, took, longer, to, reach, the, earth, the, time, between, two, successive, observations, corresponds, to, a, longer, time, between, the, instants, at, which, the, light, rays, were, emitted, a, 2011, experiment, where, neutrinos, were, observed, to, travel, faster, than, light, turned, out, to, be, due, to, experimental, error, in, models, of, the, expanding, universe, the, farther, galaxies, are, from, each, other, the, faster, they, drift, apart, for, example, galaxies, far, away, from, earth, are, inferred, to, be, moving, away, from, the, earth, with, speeds, proportional, to, their, distances, beyond, a, boundary, called, the, hubble, sphere, the, rate, at, which, their, distance, from, earth, increases, becomes, greater, than, the, speed, of, light, these, recession, rates, defined, as, the, increase, in, proper, distance, per, cosmological, time, are, not, velocities, in, a, relativistic, sense, faster, than, light, cosmological, recession, speeds, are, only, a, coordinate, artifact, in, classical, physics, light, is, described, as, a, type, of, electromagnetic, wave, the, classical, behaviour, of, the, electromagnetic, field, is, described, by, maxwell, s, equations, which, predict, that, the, speed, c, with, which, electromagnetic, waves, such, as, light, propagate, in, vacuum, is, related, to, the, distributed, capacitance, and, inductance, of, vacuum, otherwise, respectively, known, as, the, electric, constant, 0, and, the, magnetic, constant, 0, by, the, equation, in, modern, quantum, physics, the, electromagnetic, field, is, described, by, the, theory, of, quantum, electrodynamics, qed, in, this, theory, light, is, described, by, the, fundamental, excitations, or, quanta, of, the, electromagnetic, field, called, photons, in, qed, photons, are, massless, particles, and, thus, according, to, special, relativity, they, travel, at, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, extensions, of, qed, in, which, the, photon, has, a, mass, have, been, considered, in, such, a, theory, its, speed, would, depend, on, its, frequency, and, the, invariant, speed, c, of, special, relativity, would, then, be, the, upper, limit, of, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, no, variation, of, the, speed, of, light, with, frequency, has, been, observed, in, rigorous, testing, putting, stringent, limits, on, the, mass, of, the, photon, the, limit, obtained, depends, on, the, model, used, if, the, massive, photon, is, described, by, proca, theory, the, experimental, upper, bound, for, its, mass, is, about, 10, 57, grams, if, photon, mass, is, generated, by, a, higgs, mechanism, the, experimental, upper, limit, is, less, sharp, m, 10, 14, ev, c, 2, roughly, 2, 10, 47, g, another, reason, for, the, speed, of, light, to, vary, with, its, frequency, would, be, the, failure, of, special, relativity, to, apply, to, arbitrarily, small, scales, as, predicted, by, some, proposed, theories, of, quantum, gravity, in, 2009, the, observation, of, gamma, ray, burst, grb, 090510, found, no, evidence, for, a, dependence, of, photon, speed, on, energy, supporting, tight, constraints, in, specific, models, of, spacetime, quantization, on, how, this, speed, is, affected, by, photon, energy, for, energies, approaching, the, planck, scale, in, a, medium, light, usually, does, not, propagate, at, a, speed, equal, to, c, further, different, types, of, light, wave, will, travel, at, different, speeds, the, speed, at, which, the, individual, crests, and, troughs, of, a, plane, wave, a, wave, filling, the, whole, space, with, only, one, frequency, propagate, is, called, the, phase, velocity, v, p, a, physical, signal, with, a, finite, extent, a, pulse, of, light, travels, at, a, different, speed, the, overall, envelope, of, the, pulse, travels, at, the, group, velocity, v, g, and, its, earliest, part, travels, at, the, front, velocity, v, f, the, phase, velocity, is, important, in, determining, how, a, light, wave, travels, through, a, material, or, from, one, material, to, another, it, is, often, represented, in, terms, of, a, refractive, index, the, refractive, index, of, a, material, is, defined, as, the, ratio, of, c, to, the, phase, velocity, v, p, in, the, material, larger, indices, of, refraction, indicate, lower, speeds, the, refractive, index, of, a, material, may, depend, on, the, light, s, frequency, intensity, polarization, or, direction, of, propagation, in, many, cases, though, it, can, be, treated, as, a, material, dependent, constant, the, refractive, index, of, air, is, approximately, 1, 0003, denser, media, such, as, water, glass, and, diamond, have, refractive, indexes, of, around, 1, 3, 1, 5, and, 2, 4, respectively, for, visible, light, in, exotic, materials, like, bose, einstein, condensates, near, absolute, zero, the, effective, speed, of, light, may, be, only, a, few, metres, per, second, however, this, represents, absorption, and, re, radiation, delay, between, atoms, as, do, all, slower, than, c, speeds, in, material, substances, as, an, extreme, example, of, light, slowing, in, matter, two, independent, teams, of, physicists, claimed, to, bring, light, to, a, complete, standstill, by, passing, it, through, a, bose, einstein, condensate, of, the, element, rubidium, the, popular, description, of, light, being, stopped, in, these, experiments, refers, only, to, light, being, stored, in, the, excited, states, of, atoms, then, re, emitted, at, an, arbitrarily, later, time, as, stimulated, by, a, second, laser, pulse, during, the, time, it, had, stopped, it, had, ceased, to, be, light, this, type, of, behaviour, is, generally, microscopically, true, of, all, transparent, media, which, slow, the, speed, of, light, in, transparent, materials, the, refractive, index, generally, is, greater, than, 1, meaning, that, the, phase, velocity, is, less, than, c, in, other, materials, it, is, possible, for, the, refractive, index, to, become, smaller, than, 1, for, some, frequencies, in, some, exotic, materials, it, is, even, possible, for, the, index, of, refraction, to, become, negative, the, requirement, that, causality, is, not, violated, implies, that, the, real, and, imaginary, parts, of, the, dielectric, constant, of, any, material, corresponding, respectively, to, the, index, of, refraction, and, to, the, attenuation, coefficient, are, linked, by, the, kramers, kronig, relations, in, practical, terms, this, means, that, in, a, material, with, refractive, index, less, than, 1, the, wave, will, be, absorbed, quickly, a, pulse, with, different, group, and, phase, velocities, which, occurs, if, the, phase, velocity, is, not, the, same, for, all, the, frequencies, of, the, pulse, smears, out, over, time, a, process, known, as, dispersion, certain, materials, have, an, exceptionally, low, or, even, zero, group, velocity, for, light, waves, a, phenomenon, called, slow, light, the, opposite, group, velocities, exceeding, c, was, proposed, theoretically, in, 1993, and, achieved, experimentally, in, 2000, it, should, even, be, possible, for, the, group, velocity, to, become, infinite, or, negative, with, pulses, travelling, instantaneously, or, backwards, in, time, none, of, these, options, allow, information, to, be, transmitted, faster, than, c, it, is, impossible, to, transmit, information, with, a, light, pulse, any, faster, than, the, speed, of, the, earliest, part, of, the, pulse, the, front, velocity, it, can, be, shown, that, this, is, under, certain, assumptions, always, equal, to, c, it, is, possible, for, a, particle, to, travel, through, a, medium, faster, than, the, phase, velocity, of, light, in, that, medium, but, still, slower, than, c, when, a, charged, particle, does, that, in, a, dielectric, material, the, electromagnetic, equivalent, of, a, shock, wave, known, as, cherenkov, radiation, is, emitted, the, speed, of, light, is, of, relevance, to, telecommunications, the, one, way, and, round, trip, delay, time, are, greater, than, zero, this, applies, from, small, to, astronomical, scales, on, the, other, hand, some, techniques, depend, on, the, finite, speed, of, light, for, example, in, distance, measurements, in, computers, the, speed, of, light, imposes, a, limit, on, how, quickly, data, can, be, sent, between, processors, if, a, processor, operates, at, 1, gigahertz, a, signal, can, travel, only, a, maximum, of, about, 30, centimetres, 1, ft, in, a, single, clock, cycle, in, practice, this, distance, is, even, shorter, since, the, printed, circuit, board, refracts, and, slows, down, signals, processors, must, therefore, be, placed, close, to, each, other, as, well, as, memory, chips, to, minimize, communication, latencies, and, care, must, be, exercised, when, routing, wires, between, them, to, ensure, signal, integrity, if, clock, frequencies, continue, to, increase, the, speed, of, light, may, eventually, become, a, limiting, factor, for, the, internal, design, of, single, chips, given, that, the, equatorial, circumference, of, the, earth, is, about, 40, 075, km, and, that, c, is, about, 300, 000, km, s, the, theoretical, shortest, time, for, a, piece, of, information, to, travel, half, the, globe, along, the, surface, is, about, 67, milliseconds, when, light, is, traveling, in, optical, fibre, a, transparent, material, the, actual, transit, time, is, longer, in, part, because, the, speed, of, light, is, slower, by, about, 35, in, optical, fibre, depending, on, its, refractive, index, n, straight, lines, are, rare, in, global, communications, and, the, travel, time, increases, when, signals, pass, through, electronic, switches, or, signal, regenerators, although, this, distance, is, largely, irrelevant, for, most, applications, latency, becomes, important, in, fields, such, as, high, frequency, trading, where, traders, seek, to, gain, minute, advantages, by, delivering, their, trades, to, exchanges, fractions, of, a, second, ahead, of, other, traders, for, example, traders, have, been, switching, to, microwave, communications, between, trading, hubs, because, of, the, advantage, which, radio, waves, travelling, at, near, to, the, speed, of, light, through, air, have, over, comparatively, slower, fibre, optic, signals, similarly, communications, between, the, earth, and, spacecraft, are, not, instantaneous, there, is, a, brief, delay, from, the, source, to, the, receiver, which, becomes, more, noticeable, as, distances, increase, this, delay, was, significant, for, communications, between, ground, control, and, apollo, 8, when, it, became, the, first, crewed, spacecraft, to, orbit, the, moon, for, every, question, the, ground, control, station, had, to, wait, at, least, three, seconds, for, the, answer, to, arrive, the, communications, delay, between, earth, and, mars, can, vary, between, five, and, twenty, minutes, depending, upon, the, relative, positions, of, the, two, planets, as, a, consequence, of, this, if, a, robot, on, the, surface, of, mars, were, to, encounter, a, problem, its, human, controllers, would, not, be, aware, of, it, until, approximately, 4, 24, minutes, later, it, would, then, take, a, further, 4, 24, minutes, for, commands, to, travel, from, earth, to, mars, receiving, light, and, other, signals, from, distant, astronomical, sources, takes, much, longer, for, example, it, takes, 13, billion, 13, 10, 9, years, for, light, to, travel, to, earth, from, the, faraway, galaxies, viewed, in, the, hubble, ultra, deep, field, images, those, photographs, taken, today, capture, images, of, the, galaxies, as, they, appeared, 13, billion, years, ago, when, the, universe, was, less, than, a, billion, years, old, the, fact, that, more, distant, objects, appear, to, be, younger, due, to, the, finite, speed, of, light, allows, astronomers, to, infer, the, evolution, of, stars, of, galaxies, and, of, the, universe, itself, astronomical, distances, are, sometimes, expressed, in, light, years, especially, in, popular, science, publications, and, media, a, light, year, is, the, distance, light, travels, in, one, julian, year, around, 9461, billion, kilometres, 5879, billion, miles, or, 0, 3066, parsecs, in, round, figures, a, light, year, is, nearly, 10, trillion, kilometres, or, nearly, 6, trillion, miles, proxima, centauri, the, closest, star, to, earth, after, the, sun, is, around, 4, 2, light, years, away, radar, systems, measure, the, distance, to, a, target, by, the, time, it, takes, a, radio, wave, pulse, to, return, to, the, radar, antenna, after, being, reflected, by, the, target, the, distance, to, the, target, is, half, the, round, trip, transit, time, multiplied, by, the, speed, of, light, a, global, positioning, system, gps, receiver, measures, its, distance, to, gps, satellites, based, on, how, long, it, takes, for, a, radio, signal, to, arrive, from, each, satellite, and, from, these, distances, calculates, the, receiver, s, position, because, light, travels, about, 300, 000, kilometres, 186, 000, mi, in, one, second, these, measurements, of, small, fractions, of, a, second, must, be, very, precise, the, lunar, laser, ranging, experiment, radar, astronomy, and, the, deep, space, network, determine, distances, to, the, moon, planets, and, spacecraft, respectively, by, measuring, round, trip, transit, times, there, are, different, ways, to, determine, the, value, of, c, one, way, is, to, measure, the, actual, speed, at, which, light, waves, propagate, which, can, be, done, in, various, astronomical, and, earth, based, setups, it, is, also, possible, to, determine, c, from, other, physical, laws, where, it, appears, for, example, by, determining, the, values, of, the, electromagnetic, constants, 0, and, 0, and, using, their, relation, to, c, historically, the, most, accurate, results, have, been, obtained, by, separately, determining, the, frequency, and, wavelength, of, a, light, beam, with, their, product, equalling, c, this, is, described, in, more, detail, in, the, interferometry, section, below, in, 1983, the, metre, was, defined, as, the, length, of, the, path, travelled, by, light, in, vacuum, during, a, time, interval, of, 1, 299, 792, 458, of, a, second, fixing, the, value, of, the, speed, of, light, at, 299, 792, 458, m, s, by, definition, as, described, below, consequently, accurate, measurements, of, the, speed, of, light, yield, an, accurate, realization, of, the, metre, rather, than, an, accurate, value, of, c, outer, space, is, a, convenient, setting, for, measuring, the, speed, of, light, because, of, its, large, scale, and, nearly, perfect, vacuum, typically, one, measures, the, time, needed, for, light, to, traverse, some, reference, distance, in, the, solar, system, such, as, the, radius, of, the, earth, s, orbit, historically, such, measurements, could, be, made, fairly, accurately, compared, to, how, accurately, the, length, of, the, reference, distance, is, known, in, earth, based, units, ole, christensen, r, mer, used, an, astronomical, measurement, to, make, the, first, quantitative, estimate, of, the, speed, of, light, in, the, year, 1676, when, measured, from, earth, the, periods, of, moons, orbiting, a, distant, planet, are, shorter, when, the, earth, is, approaching, the, planet, than, when, the, earth, is, receding, from, it, the, difference, is, small, but, the, cumulative, time, becomes, significant, when, measured, over, months, the, distance, travelled, by, light, from, the, planet, or, its, moon, to, earth, is, shorter, when, the, earth, is, at, the, point, in, its, orbit, that, is, closest, to, its, planet, than, when, the, earth, is, at, the, farthest, point, in, its, orbit, the, difference, in, distance, being, the, diameter, of, the, earth, s, orbit, around, the, sun, the, observed, change, in, the, moon, s, orbital, period, is, caused, by, the, difference, in, the, time, it, takes, light, to, traverse, the, shorter, or, longer, distance, r, mer, observed, this, effect, for, jupiter, s, innermost, major, moon, io, and, deduced, that, light, takes, 22, minutes, to, cross, the, diameter, of, the, earth, s, orbit, another, method, is, to, use, the, aberration, of, light, discovered, and, explained, by, james, bradley, in, the, 18th, century, this, effect, results, from, the, vector, addition, of, the, velocity, of, light, arriving, from, a, distant, source, such, as, a, star, and, the, velocity, of, its, observer, see, diagram, on, the, right, a, moving, observer, thus, sees, the, light, coming, from, a, slightly, different, direction, and, consequently, sees, the, source, at, a, position, shifted, from, its, original, position, since, the, direction, of, the, earth, s, velocity, changes, continuously, as, the, earth, orbits, the, sun, this, effect, causes, the, apparent, position, of, stars, to, move, around, from, the, angular, difference, in, the, position, of, stars, maximally, 20, 5, arcseconds, it, is, possible, to, express, the, speed, of, light, in, terms, of, the, earth, s, velocity, around, the, sun, which, with, the, known, length, of, a, year, can, be, converted, to, the, time, needed, to, travel, from, the, sun, to, the, earth, in, 1729, bradley, used, this, method, to, derive, that, light, travelled, 10, 210, times, faster, than, the, earth, in, its, orbit, the, modern, figure, is, 10, 066, times, faster, or, equivalently, that, it, would, take, light, 8, minutes, 12, seconds, to, travel, from, the, sun, to, the, earth, an, astronomical, unit, au, is, approximately, the, average, distance, between, the, earth, and, sun, it, was, redefined, in, 2012, as, exactly, 149, 597, 870, 700, m, previously, the, au, was, not, based, on, the, international, system, of, units, but, in, terms, of, the, gravitational, force, exerted, by, the, sun, in, the, framework, of, classical, mechanics, the, current, definition, uses, the, recommended, value, in, metres, for, the, previous, definition, of, the, astronomical, unit, which, was, determined, by, measurement, this, redefinition, is, analogous, to, that, of, the, metre, and, likewise, has, the, effect, of, fixing, the, speed, of, light, to, an, exact, value, in, astronomical, units, per, second, via, the, exact, speed, of, light, in, metres, per, second, previously, the, inverse, of, c, expressed, in, seconds, per, astronomical, unit, was, measured, by, comparing, the, time, for, radio, signals, to, reach, different, spacecraft, in, the, solar, system, with, their, position, calculated, from, the, gravitational, effects, of, the, sun, and, various, planets, by, combining, many, such, measurements, a, best, fit, value, for, the, light, time, per, unit, distance, could, be, obtained, for, example, in, 2009, the, best, estimate, as, approved, by, the, international, astronomical, union, iau, was, the, relative, uncertainty, in, these, measurements, is, 0, 02, parts, per, billion, 2, 10, 11, equivalent, to, the, uncertainty, in, earth, based, measurements, of, length, by, interferometry, since, the, metre, is, defined, to, be, the, length, travelled, by, light, in, a, certain, time, interval, the, measurement, of, the, light, time, in, terms, of, the, previous, definition, of, the, astronomical, unit, can, also, be, interpreted, as, measuring, the, length, of, an, au, old, definition, in, metres, a, method, of, measuring, the, speed, of, light, is, to, measure, the, time, needed, for, light, to, travel, to, a, mirror, at, a, known, distance, and, back, this, is, the, working, principle, behind, experiments, by, hippolyte, fizeau, and, l, on, foucault, the, setup, as, used, by, fizeau, consists, of, a, beam, of, light, directed, at, a, mirror, 8, kilometres, 5, mi, away, on, the, way, from, the, source, to, the, mirror, the, beam, passes, through, a, rotating, cogwheel, at, a, certain, rate, of, rotation, the, beam, passes, through, one, gap, on, the, way, out, and, another, on, the, way, back, but, at, slightly, higher, or, lower, rates, the, beam, strikes, a, tooth, and, does, not, pass, through, the, wheel, knowing, the, distance, between, the, wheel, and, the, mirror, the, number, of, teeth, on, the, wheel, and, the, rate, of, rotation, the, speed, of, light, can, be, calculated, the, method, of, foucault, replaces, the, cogwheel, with, a, rotating, mirror, because, the, mirror, keeps, rotating, while, the, light, travels, to, the, distant, mirror, and, back, the, light, is, reflected, from, the, rotating, mirror, at, a, different, angle, on, its, way, out, than, it, is, on, its, way, back, from, this, difference, in, angle, the, known, speed, of, rotation, and, the, distance, to, the, distant, mirror, the, speed, of, light, may, be, calculated, foucault, used, this, apparatus, to, measure, the, speed, of, light, in, air, versus, water, based, on, a, suggestion, by, fran, ois, arago, today, using, oscilloscopes, with, time, resolutions, of, less, than, one, nanosecond, the, speed, of, light, can, be, directly, measured, by, timing, the, delay, of, a, light, pulse, from, a, laser, or, an, led, reflected, from, a, mirror, this, method, is, less, precise, with, errors, of, the, order, of, 1, than, other, modern, techniques, but, it, is, sometimes, used, as, a, laboratory, experiment, in, college, physics, classes, an, option, for, deriving, c, that, does, not, directly, depend, on, a, measurement, of, the, propagation, of, electromagnetic, waves, is, to, use, the, relation, between, c, and, the, vacuum, permittivity, 0, and, vacuum, permeability, 0, established, by, maxwell, s, theory, c, 2, 1, 0, 0, the, vacuum, permittivity, may, be, determined, by, measuring, the, capacitance, and, dimensions, of, a, capacitor, whereas, the, value, of, the, vacuum, permeability, was, historically, fixed, at, exactly, 4, 10, 7, h, m, 1, through, the, definition, of, the, ampere, rosa, and, dorsey, used, this, method, in, 1907, to, find, a, value, of, 299, 710, 22, km, s, their, method, depended, upon, having, a, standard, unit, of, electrical, resistance, the, international, ohm, and, so, its, accuracy, was, limited, by, how, this, standard, was, defined, another, way, to, measure, the, speed, of, light, is, to, independently, measure, the, frequency, f, and, wavelength, of, an, electromagnetic, wave, in, vacuum, the, value, of, c, can, then, be, found, by, using, the, relation, c, f, one, option, is, to, measure, the, resonance, frequency, of, a, cavity, resonator, if, the, dimensions, of, the, resonance, cavity, are, also, known, these, can, be, used, to, determine, the, wavelength, of, the, wave, in, 1946, louis, essen, and, a, c, gordon, smith, established, the, frequency, for, a, variety, of, normal, modes, of, microwaves, of, a, microwave, cavity, of, precisely, known, dimensions, the, dimensions, were, established, to, an, accuracy, of, about, 0, 8, m, using, gauges, calibrated, by, interferometry, as, the, wavelength, of, the, modes, was, known, from, the, geometry, of, the, cavity, and, from, electromagnetic, theory, knowledge, of, the, associated, frequencies, enabled, a, calculation, of, the, speed, of, light, the, essen, gordon, smith, result, 299, 792, 9, km, s, was, substantially, more, precise, than, those, found, by, optical, techniques, by, 1950, repeated, measurements, by, essen, established, a, result, of, 299, 792, 5, 3, 0, km, s, a, household, demonstration, of, this, technique, is, possible, using, a, microwave, oven, and, food, such, as, marshmallows, or, margarine, if, the, turntable, is, removed, so, that, the, food, does, not, move, it, will, cook, the, fastest, at, the, antinodes, the, points, at, which, the, wave, amplitude, is, the, greatest, where, it, will, begin, to, melt, the, distance, between, two, such, spots, is, half, the, wavelength, of, the, microwaves, by, measuring, this, distance, and, multiplying, the, wavelength, by, the, microwave, frequency, usually, displayed, on, the, back, of, the, oven, typically, 2450, mhz, the, value, of, c, can, be, calculated, often, with, less, than, 5, error, interferometry, is, another, method, to, find, the, wavelength, of, electromagnetic, radiation, for, determining, the, speed, of, light, a, coherent, beam, of, light, e, g, from, a, laser, with, a, known, frequency, f, is, split, to, follow, two, paths, and, then, recombined, by, adjusting, the, path, length, while, observing, the, interference, pattern, and, carefully, measuring, the, change, in, path, length, the, wavelength, of, the, light, can, be, determined, the, speed, of, light, is, then, calculated, using, the, equation, c, f, before, the, advent, of, laser, technology, coherent, radio, sources, were, used, for, interferometry, measurements, of, the, speed, of, light, interferometric, determination, of, wavelength, becomes, less, precise, with, wavelength, and, the, experiments, were, thus, limited, in, precision, by, the, long, wavelength, 4, mm, 0, 16, in, of, the, radiowaves, the, precision, can, be, improved, by, using, light, with, a, shorter, wavelength, but, then, it, becomes, difficult, to, directly, measure, the, frequency, of, the, light, one, way, around, this, problem, is, to, start, with, a, low, frequency, signal, of, which, the, frequency, can, be, precisely, measured, and, from, this, signal, progressively, synthesize, higher, frequency, signals, whose, frequency, can, then, be, linked, to, the, original, signal, a, laser, can, then, be, locked, to, the, frequency, and, its, wavelength, can, be, determined, using, interferometry, this, technique, was, due, to, a, group, at, the, national, bureau, of, standards, which, later, became, the, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, they, used, it, in, 1972, to, measure, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, with, a, fractional, uncertainty, of, 3, 5, 10, 9, until, the, early, modern, period, it, was, not, known, whether, light, travelled, instantaneously, or, at, a, very, fast, finite, speed, the, first, extant, recorded, examination, of, this, subject, was, in, ancient, greece, the, ancient, greeks, arabic, scholars, and, classical, european, scientists, long, debated, this, until, r, mer, provided, the, first, calculation, of, the, speed, of, light, einstein, s, theory, of, special, relativity, postulates, that, the, speed, of, light, is, constant, regardless, of, one, s, frame, of, reference, since, then, scientists, have, provided, increasingly, accurate, measurements, empedocles, c, 490, 430, bce, was, the, first, to, propose, a, theory, of, light, and, claimed, that, light, has, a, finite, speed, he, maintained, that, light, was, something, in, motion, and, therefore, must, take, some, time, to, travel, aristotle, argued, to, the, contrary, that, light, is, due, to, the, presence, of, something, but, it, is, not, a, movement, euclid, and, ptolemy, advanced, empedocles, emission, theory, of, vision, where, light, is, emitted, from, the, eye, thus, enabling, sight, based, on, that, theory, heron, of, alexandria, argued, that, the, speed, of, light, must, be, infinite, because, distant, objects, such, as, stars, appear, immediately, upon, opening, the, eyes, early, islamic, philosophers, initially, agreed, with, the, aristotelian, view, that, light, had, no, speed, of, travel, in, 1021, alhazen, ibn, al, haytham, published, the, book, of, optics, in, which, he, presented, a, series, of, arguments, dismissing, the, emission, theory, of, vision, in, favour, of, the, now, accepted, intromission, theory, in, which, light, moves, from, an, object, into, the, eye, this, led, alhazen, to, propose, that, light, must, have, a, finite, speed, and, that, the, speed, of, light, is, variable, decreasing, in, denser, bodies, he, argued, that, light, is, substantial, matter, the, propagation, of, which, requires, time, even, if, this, is, hidden, from, the, senses, also, in, the, 11th, century, ab, rayh, n, al, b, r, n, agreed, that, light, has, a, finite, speed, and, observed, that, the, speed, of, light, is, much, faster, than, the, speed, of, sound, in, the, 13th, century, roger, bacon, argued, that, the, speed, of, light, in, air, was, not, infinite, using, philosophical, arguments, backed, by, the, writing, of, alhazen, and, aristotle, in, the, 1270s, witelo, considered, the, possibility, of, light, travelling, at, infinite, speed, in, vacuum, but, slowing, down, in, denser, bodies, in, the, early, 17th, century, johannes, kepler, believed, that, the, speed, of, light, was, infinite, since, empty, space, presents, no, obstacle, to, it, ren, descartes, argued, that, if, the, speed, of, light, were, to, be, finite, the, sun, earth, and, moon, would, be, noticeably, out, of, alignment, during, a, lunar, eclipse, although, this, argument, fails, when, aberration, of, light, is, taken, into, account, the, latter, was, not, recognized, until, the, following, century, since, such, misalignment, had, not, been, observed, descartes, concluded, the, speed, of, light, was, infinite, descartes, speculated, that, if, the, speed, of, light, were, found, to, be, finite, his, whole, system, of, philosophy, might, be, demolished, despite, this, in, his, derivation, of, snell, s, law, descartes, assumed, that, some, kind, of, motion, associated, with, light, was, faster, in, denser, media, pierre, de, fermat, derived, snell, s, law, using, the, opposing, assumption, the, denser, the, medium, the, slower, light, travelled, fermat, also, argued, in, support, of, a, finite, speed, of, light, in, 1629, isaac, beeckman, proposed, an, experiment, in, which, a, person, observes, the, flash, of, a, cannon, reflecting, off, a, mirror, about, one, mile, 1, 6, km, away, in, 1638, galileo, galilei, proposed, an, experiment, with, an, apparent, claim, to, having, performed, it, some, years, earlier, to, measure, the, speed, of, light, by, observing, the, delay, between, uncovering, a, lantern, and, its, perception, some, distance, away, he, was, unable, to, distinguish, whether, light, travel, was, instantaneous, or, not, but, concluded, that, if, it, were, not, it, must, nevertheless, be, extraordinarily, rapid, in, 1667, the, accademia, del, cimento, of, florence, reported, that, it, had, performed, galileo, s, experiment, with, the, lanterns, separated, by, about, one, mile, but, no, delay, was, observed, the, actual, delay, in, this, experiment, would, have, been, about, 11, microseconds, the, first, quantitative, estimate, of, the, speed, of, light, was, made, in, 1676, by, ole, r, mer, from, the, observation, that, the, periods, of, jupiter, s, innermost, moon, io, appeared, to, be, shorter, when, the, earth, was, approaching, jupiter, than, when, receding, from, it, he, concluded, that, light, travels, at, a, finite, speed, and, estimated, that, it, takes, light, 22, minutes, to, cross, the, diameter, of, earth, s, orbit, christiaan, huygens, combined, this, estimate, with, an, estimate, for, the, diameter, of, the, earth, s, orbit, to, obtain, an, estimate, of, speed, of, light, of, 220, 000, km, s, which, is, 27, lower, than, the, actual, value, in, his, 1704, book, opticks, isaac, newton, reported, r, mer, s, calculations, of, the, finite, speed, of, light, and, gave, a, value, of, seven, or, eight, minutes, for, the, time, taken, for, light, to, travel, from, the, sun, to, the, earth, the, modern, value, is, 8, minutes, 19, seconds, newton, queried, whether, r, mer, s, eclipse, shadows, were, coloured, hearing, that, they, were, not, he, concluded, the, different, colours, travelled, at, the, same, speed, in, 1729, james, bradley, discovered, stellar, aberration, from, this, effect, he, determined, that, light, must, travel, 10, 210, times, faster, than, the, earth, in, its, orbit, the, modern, figure, is, 10, 066, times, faster, or, equivalently, that, it, would, take, light, 8, minutes, 12, seconds, to, travel, from, the, sun, to, the, earth, in, the, 19th, century, hippolyte, fizeau, developed, a, method, to, determine, the, speed, of, light, based, on, time, of, flight, measurements, on, earth, and, reported, a, value, of, 315, 000, km, s, his, method, was, improved, upon, by, l, on, foucault, who, obtained, a, value, of, 298, 000, km, s, in, 1862, in, the, year, 1856, wilhelm, eduard, weber, and, rudolf, kohlrausch, measured, the, ratio, of, the, electromagnetic, and, electrostatic, units, of, charge, 1, 0, 0, by, discharging, a, leyden, jar, and, found, that, its, numerical, value, was, very, close, to, the, speed, of, light, as, measured, directly, by, fizeau, the, following, year, gustav, kirchhoff, calculated, that, an, electric, signal, in, a, resistanceless, wire, travels, along, the, wire, at, this, speed, in, the, early, 1860s, maxwell, showed, that, according, to, the, theory, of, electromagnetism, he, was, working, on, electromagnetic, waves, propagate, in, empty, space, at, a, speed, equal, to, the, above, weber, kohlrausch, ratio, and, drawing, attention, to, the, numerical, proximity, of, this, value, to, the, speed, of, light, as, measured, by, fizeau, he, proposed, that, light, is, in, fact, an, electromagnetic, wave, maxwell, backed, up, his, claim, with, his, own, experiment, published, in, the, 1868, philosophical, transactions, which, determined, the, ratio, of, the, electrostatic, and, electromagnetic, units, of, electricity, the, wave, properties, of, light, were, well, known, since, thomas, young, in, the, 19th, century, physicists, believed, light, was, propagating, in, a, medium, called, aether, or, ether, but, for, electric, force, it, looks, more, like, the, gravitational, force, in, newton, s, law, a, transmitting, medium, was, not, required, after, maxwell, theory, unified, light, and, electric, and, magnetic, waves, it, was, favored, that, both, light, and, electric, magnetic, waves, propagate, in, the, same, aether, medium, or, called, the, luminiferous, aether, it, was, thought, at, the, time, that, empty, space, was, filled, with, a, background, medium, called, the, luminiferous, aether, in, which, the, electromagnetic, field, existed, some, physicists, thought, that, this, aether, acted, as, a, preferred, frame, of, reference, for, the, propagation, of, light, and, therefore, it, should, be, possible, to, measure, the, motion, of, the, earth, with, respect, to, this, medium, by, measuring, the, isotropy, of, the, speed, of, light, beginning, in, the, 1880s, several, experiments, were, performed, to, try, to, detect, this, motion, the, most, famous, of, which, is, the, experiment, performed, by, albert, a, michelson, and, edward, w, morley, in, 1887, the, detected, motion, was, found, to, always, be, nil, within, observational, error, modern, experiments, indicate, that, the, two, way, speed, of, light, is, isotropic, the, same, in, every, direction, to, within, 6, nanometres, per, second, because, of, this, experiment, hendrik, lorentz, proposed, that, the, motion, of, the, apparatus, through, the, aether, may, cause, the, apparatus, to, contract, along, its, length, in, the, direction, of, motion, and, he, further, assumed, that, the, time, variable, for, moving, systems, must, also, be, changed, accordingly, local, time, which, led, to, the, formulation, of, the, lorentz, transformation, based, on, lorentz, s, aether, theory, henri, poincar, 1900, showed, that, this, local, time, to, first, order, in, v, c, is, indicated, by, clocks, moving, in, the, aether, which, are, synchronized, under, the, assumption, of, constant, light, speed, in, 1904, he, speculated, that, the, speed, of, light, could, be, a, limiting, velocity, in, dynamics, provided, that, the, assumptions, of, lorentz, s, theory, are, all, confirmed, in, 1905, poincar, brought, lorentz, s, aether, theory, into, full, observational, agreement, with, the, principle, of, relativity, in, 1905, einstein, postulated, from, the, outset, that, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, measured, by, a, non, accelerating, observer, is, independent, of, the, motion, of, the, source, or, observer, using, this, and, the, principle, of, relativity, as, a, basis, he, derived, the, special, theory, of, relativity, in, which, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, c, featured, as, a, fundamental, constant, also, appearing, in, contexts, unrelated, to, light, this, made, the, concept, of, the, stationary, aether, to, which, lorentz, and, poincar, still, adhered, useless, and, revolutionized, the, concepts, of, space, and, time, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, much, progress, was, made, in, increasing, the, accuracy, of, measurements, of, the, speed, of, light, first, by, cavity, resonance, techniques, and, later, by, laser, interferometer, techniques, these, were, aided, by, new, more, precise, definitions, of, the, metre, and, second, in, 1950, louis, essen, determined, the, speed, as, 299, 792, 5, 3, 0, km, s, using, cavity, resonance, this, value, was, adopted, by, the, 12th, general, assembly, of, the, radio, scientific, union, in, 1957, in, 1960, the, metre, was, redefined, in, terms, of, the, wavelength, of, a, particular, spectral, line, of, krypton, 86, and, in, 1967, the, second, was, redefined, in, terms, of, the, hyperfine, transition, frequency, of, the, ground, state, of, caesium, 133, in, 1972, using, the, laser, interferometer, method, and, the, new, definitions, a, group, at, the, us, national, bureau, of, standards, in, boulder, colorado, determined, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, to, be, c, 299, 792, 456, 2, 1, 1, m, s, this, was, 100, times, less, uncertain, than, the, previously, accepted, value, the, remaining, uncertainty, was, mainly, related, to, the, definition, of, the, metre, as, similar, experiments, found, comparable, results, for, c, the, 15th, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, in, 1975, recommended, using, the, value, 299, 792, 458, m, s, for, the, speed, of, light, in, 1983, the, 17th, meeting, of, the, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, cgpm, found, that, wavelengths, from, frequency, measurements, and, a, given, value, for, the, speed, of, light, are, more, reproducible, than, the, previous, standard, they, kept, the, 1967, definition, of, second, so, the, caesium, hyperfine, frequency, would, now, determine, both, the, second, and, the, metre, to, do, this, they, redefined, the, metre, as, the, length, of, the, path, traveled, by, light, in, vacuum, during, a, time, interval, of, 1, 299, 792, 458, of, a, second, as, a, result, of, this, definition, the, value, of, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, is, exactly, 299, 792, 458, m, s, and, has, become, a, defined, constant, in, the, si, system, of, units, improved, experimental, techniques, that, prior, to, 1983, would, have, measured, the, speed, of, light, no, longer, affect, the, known, value, of, the, speed, of, light, in, si, units, but, instead, allow, a, more, precise, realization, of, the, metre, by, more, accurately, measuring, the, wavelength, of, krypton, 86, and, other, light, sources, in, 2011, the, cgpm, stated, its, intention, to, redefine, all, seven, si, base, units, using, what, it, calls, the, explicit, constant, formulation, where, each, unit, is, defined, indirectly, by, specifying, explicitly, an, exact, value, for, a, well, recognized, fundamental, constant, as, was, done, for, the, speed, of, light, it, proposed, a, new, but, completely, equivalent, wording, of, the, metre, s, definition, the, metre, symbol, m, is, the, unit, of, length, its, magnitude, is, set, by, fixing, the, numerical, value, of, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, to, be, equal, to, exactly, 299, 792, 458, when, it, is, expressed, in, the, si, unit, m, s, 1, this, was, one, of, the, changes, that, was, incorporated, in, the, 2019, revision, of, the, si, also, termed, the, new, si
