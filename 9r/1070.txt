thermodynamics, is, a, branch, of, physics, that, deals, with, heat, work, and, temperature, and, their, relation, to, energy, entropy, and, the, physical, properties, of, matter, and, radiation, the, behavior, of, these, quantities, is, governed, by, the, four, laws, of, thermodynamics, which, convey, a, quantitative, description, using, measurable, macroscopic, physical, quantities, but, may, be, explained, in, terms, of, microscopic, constituents, by, statistical, mechanics, thermodynamics, applies, to, a, wide, variety, of, topics, in, science, and, engineering, especially, physical, chemistry, biochemistry, chemical, engineering, and, mechanical, engineering, but, also, in, other, complex, fields, such, as, meteorology, historically, thermodynamics, developed, out, of, a, desire, to, increase, the, efficiency, of, early, steam, engines, particularly, through, the, work, of, french, physicist, sadi, carnot, 1824, who, believed, that, engine, efficiency, was, the, key, that, could, help, france, win, the, napoleonic, wars, scots, irish, physicist, lord, kelvin, was, the, first, to, formulate, a, concise, definition, of, thermodynamics, in, 1854, which, stated, thermo, dynamics, is, the, subject, of, the, relation, of, heat, to, forces, acting, between, contiguous, parts, of, bodies, and, the, relation, of, heat, to, electrical, agency, german, physicist, and, mathematician, rudolf, clausius, restated, carnot, s, principle, known, as, the, carnot, cycle, and, gave, to, the, theory, of, heat, a, truer, and, sounder, basis, his, most, important, paper, on, the, moving, force, of, heat, published, in, 1850, first, stated, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, in, 1865, he, introduced, the, concept, of, entropy, in, 1870, he, introduced, the, virial, theorem, which, applied, to, heat, the, initial, application, of, thermodynamics, to, mechanical, heat, engines, was, quickly, extended, to, the, study, of, chemical, compounds, and, chemical, reactions, chemical, thermodynamics, studies, the, nature, of, the, role, of, entropy, in, the, process, of, chemical, reactions, and, has, provided, the, bulk, of, expansion, and, knowledge, of, the, field, other, formulations, of, thermodynamics, emerged, statistical, thermodynamics, or, statistical, mechanics, concerns, itself, with, statistical, predictions, of, the, collective, motion, of, particles, from, their, microscopic, behavior, in, 1909, constantin, carath, odory, presented, a, purely, mathematical, approach, in, an, axiomatic, formulation, a, description, often, referred, to, as, geometrical, thermodynamics, a, description, of, any, thermodynamic, system, employs, the, four, laws, of, thermodynamics, that, form, an, axiomatic, basis, the, first, law, specifies, that, energy, can, be, transferred, between, physical, systems, as, heat, as, work, and, with, transfer, of, matter, the, second, law, defines, the, existence, of, a, quantity, called, entropy, that, describes, the, direction, thermodynamically, that, a, system, can, evolve, and, quantifies, the, state, of, order, of, a, system, and, that, can, be, used, to, quantify, the, useful, work, that, can, be, extracted, from, the, system, in, thermodynamics, interactions, between, large, ensembles, of, objects, are, studied, and, categorized, central, to, this, are, the, concepts, of, the, thermodynamic, system, and, its, surroundings, a, system, is, composed, of, particles, whose, average, motions, define, its, properties, and, those, properties, are, in, turn, related, to, one, another, through, equations, of, state, properties, can, be, combined, to, express, internal, energy, and, thermodynamic, potentials, which, are, useful, for, determining, conditions, for, equilibrium, and, spontaneous, processes, with, these, tools, thermodynamics, can, be, used, to, describe, how, systems, respond, to, changes, in, their, environment, this, can, be, applied, to, a, wide, variety, of, topics, in, science, and, engineering, such, as, engines, phase, transitions, chemical, reactions, transport, phenomena, and, even, black, holes, the, results, of, thermodynamics, are, essential, for, other, fields, of, physics, and, for, chemistry, chemical, engineering, corrosion, engineering, aerospace, engineering, mechanical, engineering, cell, biology, biomedical, engineering, materials, science, and, economics, to, name, a, few, this, article, is, focused, mainly, on, classical, thermodynamics, which, primarily, studies, systems, in, thermodynamic, equilibrium, non, equilibrium, thermodynamics, is, often, treated, as, an, extension, of, the, classical, treatment, but, statistical, mechanics, has, brought, many, advances, to, that, field, the, history, of, thermodynamics, as, a, scientific, discipline, generally, begins, with, otto, von, guericke, who, in, 1650, built, and, designed, the, world, s, first, vacuum, pump, and, demonstrated, a, vacuum, using, his, magdeburg, hemispheres, guericke, was, driven, to, make, a, vacuum, in, order, to, disprove, aristotle, s, long, held, supposition, that, nature, abhors, a, vacuum, shortly, after, guericke, the, anglo, irish, physicist, and, chemist, robert, boyle, had, learned, of, guericke, s, designs, and, in, 1656, in, coordination, with, english, scientist, robert, hooke, built, an, air, pump, using, this, pump, boyle, and, hooke, noticed, a, correlation, between, pressure, temperature, and, volume, in, time, boyle, s, law, was, formulated, which, states, that, pressure, and, volume, are, inversely, proportional, then, in, 1679, based, on, these, concepts, an, associate, of, boyle, s, named, denis, papin, built, a, steam, digester, which, was, a, closed, vessel, with, a, tightly, fitting, lid, that, confined, steam, until, a, high, pressure, was, generated, later, designs, implemented, a, steam, release, valve, that, kept, the, machine, from, exploding, by, watching, the, valve, rhythmically, move, up, and, down, papin, conceived, of, the, idea, of, a, piston, and, a, cylinder, engine, he, did, not, however, follow, through, with, his, design, nevertheless, in, 1697, based, on, papin, s, designs, engineer, thomas, savery, built, the, first, engine, followed, by, thomas, newcomen, in, 1712, although, these, early, engines, were, crude, and, inefficient, they, attracted, the, attention, of, the, leading, scientists, of, the, time, the, fundamental, concepts, of, heat, capacity, and, latent, heat, which, were, necessary, for, the, development, of, thermodynamics, were, developed, by, professor, joseph, black, at, the, university, of, glasgow, where, james, watt, was, employed, as, an, instrument, maker, black, and, watt, performed, experiments, together, but, it, was, watt, who, conceived, the, idea, of, the, external, condenser, which, resulted, in, a, large, increase, in, steam, engine, efficiency, drawing, on, all, the, previous, work, led, sadi, carnot, the, father, of, thermodynamics, to, publish, reflections, on, the, motive, power, of, fire, 1824, a, discourse, on, heat, power, energy, and, engine, efficiency, the, book, outlined, the, basic, energetic, relations, between, the, carnot, engine, the, carnot, cycle, and, motive, power, it, marked, the, start, of, thermodynamics, as, a, modern, science, the, first, thermodynamic, textbook, was, written, in, 1859, by, william, rankine, originally, trained, as, a, physicist, and, a, civil, and, mechanical, engineering, professor, at, the, university, of, glasgow, the, first, and, second, laws, of, thermodynamics, emerged, simultaneously, in, the, 1850s, primarily, out, of, the, works, of, william, rankine, rudolf, clausius, and, william, thomson, lord, kelvin, the, foundations, of, statistical, thermodynamics, were, set, out, by, physicists, such, as, james, clerk, maxwell, ludwig, boltzmann, max, planck, rudolf, clausius, and, j, willard, gibbs, clausius, who, first, stated, the, basic, ideas, of, the, second, law, in, his, paper, on, the, moving, force, of, heat, published, in, 1850, and, is, called, one, of, the, founding, fathers, of, thermodynamics, introduced, the, concept, of, entropy, in, 1865, during, the, years, 1873, 76, the, american, mathematical, physicist, josiah, willard, gibbs, published, a, series, of, three, papers, the, most, famous, being, on, the, equilibrium, of, heterogeneous, substances, in, which, he, showed, how, thermodynamic, processes, including, chemical, reactions, could, be, graphically, analyzed, by, studying, the, energy, entropy, volume, temperature, and, pressure, of, the, thermodynamic, system, in, such, a, manner, one, can, determine, if, a, process, would, occur, spontaneously, also, pierre, duhem, in, the, 19th, century, wrote, about, chemical, thermodynamics, during, the, early, 20th, century, chemists, such, as, gilbert, n, lewis, merle, randall, and, e, a, guggenheim, applied, the, mathematical, methods, of, gibbs, to, the, analysis, of, chemical, processes, thermodynamics, has, an, intricate, etymology, by, a, surface, level, analysis, the, word, consists, of, two, parts, that, can, be, traced, back, to, ancient, greek, firstly, thermo, of, heat, used, in, words, such, as, thermometer, can, be, traced, back, to, the, root, therme, meaning, heat, secondly, the, word, dynamics, science, of, force, can, be, traced, back, to, the, root, dynamis, meaning, power, in, 1849, the, adjective, thermo, dynamic, is, used, by, william, thomson, in, 1854, the, noun, thermo, dynamics, is, used, by, thomson, and, william, rankine, to, represent, the, science, of, generalized, heat, engines, pierre, perrot, claims, that, the, term, thermodynamics, was, coined, by, james, joule, in, 1858, to, designate, the, science, of, relations, between, heat, and, power, however, joule, never, used, that, term, but, used, instead, the, term, perfect, thermo, dynamic, engine, in, reference, to, thomson, s, 1849, phraseology, the, study, of, thermodynamical, systems, has, developed, into, several, related, branches, each, using, a, different, fundamental, model, as, a, theoretical, or, experimental, basis, or, applying, the, principles, to, varying, types, of, systems, classical, thermodynamics, is, the, description, of, the, states, of, thermodynamic, systems, at, near, equilibrium, that, uses, macroscopic, measurable, properties, it, is, used, to, model, exchanges, of, energy, work, and, heat, based, on, the, laws, of, thermodynamics, the, qualifier, classical, reflects, the, fact, that, it, represents, the, first, level, of, understanding, of, the, subject, as, it, developed, in, the, 19th, century, and, describes, the, changes, of, a, system, in, terms, of, macroscopic, empirical, large, scale, and, measurable, parameters, a, microscopic, interpretation, of, these, concepts, was, later, provided, by, the, development, of, statistical, mechanics, statistical, mechanics, also, known, as, statistical, thermodynamics, emerged, with, the, development, of, atomic, and, molecular, theories, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, century, and, supplemented, classical, thermodynamics, with, an, interpretation, of, the, microscopic, interactions, between, individual, particles, or, quantum, mechanical, states, this, field, relates, the, microscopic, properties, of, individual, atoms, and, molecules, to, the, macroscopic, bulk, properties, of, materials, that, can, be, observed, on, the, human, scale, thereby, explaining, classical, thermodynamics, as, a, natural, result, of, statistics, classical, mechanics, and, quantum, theory, at, the, microscopic, level, chemical, thermodynamics, is, the, study, of, the, interrelation, of, energy, with, chemical, reactions, or, with, a, physical, change, of, state, within, the, confines, of, the, laws, of, thermodynamics, the, primary, objective, of, chemical, thermodynamics, is, determining, the, spontaneity, of, a, given, transformation, equilibrium, thermodynamics, is, the, study, of, transfers, of, matter, and, energy, in, systems, or, bodies, that, by, agencies, in, their, surroundings, can, be, driven, from, one, state, of, thermodynamic, equilibrium, to, another, the, term, thermodynamic, equilibrium, indicates, a, state, of, balance, in, which, all, macroscopic, flows, are, zero, in, the, case, of, the, simplest, systems, or, bodies, their, intensive, properties, are, homogeneous, and, their, pressures, are, perpendicular, to, their, boundaries, in, an, equilibrium, state, there, are, no, unbalanced, potentials, or, driving, forces, between, macroscopically, distinct, parts, of, the, system, a, central, aim, in, equilibrium, thermodynamics, is, given, a, system, in, a, well, defined, initial, equilibrium, state, and, given, its, surroundings, and, given, its, constitutive, walls, to, calculate, what, will, be, the, final, equilibrium, state, of, the, system, after, a, specified, thermodynamic, operation, has, changed, its, walls, or, surroundings, non, equilibrium, thermodynamics, is, a, branch, of, thermodynamics, that, deals, with, systems, that, are, not, in, thermodynamic, equilibrium, most, systems, found, in, nature, are, not, in, thermodynamic, equilibrium, because, they, are, not, in, stationary, states, and, are, continuously, and, discontinuously, subject, to, flux, of, matter, and, energy, to, and, from, other, systems, the, thermodynamic, study, of, non, equilibrium, systems, requires, more, general, concepts, than, are, dealt, with, by, equilibrium, thermodynamics, many, natural, systems, still, today, remain, beyond, the, scope, of, currently, known, macroscopic, thermodynamic, methods, thermodynamics, is, principally, based, on, a, set, of, four, laws, which, are, universally, valid, when, applied, to, systems, that, fall, within, the, constraints, implied, by, each, in, the, various, theoretical, descriptions, of, thermodynamics, these, laws, may, be, expressed, in, seemingly, differing, forms, but, the, most, prominent, formulations, are, the, following, the, zeroth, law, of, thermodynamics, states, if, two, systems, are, each, in, thermal, equilibrium, with, a, third, they, are, also, in, thermal, equilibrium, with, each, other, this, statement, implies, that, thermal, equilibrium, is, an, equivalence, relation, on, the, set, of, thermodynamic, systems, under, consideration, systems, are, said, to, be, in, equilibrium, if, the, small, random, exchanges, between, them, e, g, brownian, motion, do, not, lead, to, a, net, change, in, energy, this, law, is, tacitly, assumed, in, every, measurement, of, temperature, thus, if, one, seeks, to, decide, whether, two, bodies, are, at, the, same, temperature, it, is, not, necessary, to, bring, them, into, contact, and, measure, any, changes, of, their, observable, properties, in, time, the, law, provides, an, empirical, definition, of, temperature, and, justification, for, the, construction, of, practical, thermometers, the, zeroth, law, was, not, initially, recognized, as, a, separate, law, of, thermodynamics, as, its, basis, in, thermodynamical, equilibrium, was, implied, in, the, other, laws, the, first, second, and, third, laws, had, been, explicitly, stated, already, and, found, common, acceptance, in, the, physics, community, before, the, importance, of, the, zeroth, law, for, the, definition, of, temperature, was, realized, as, it, was, impractical, to, renumber, the, other, laws, it, was, named, the, zeroth, law, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, states, in, a, process, without, transfer, of, matter, the, change, in, internal, energy, u, displaystyle, delta, u, of, a, thermodynamic, system, is, equal, to, the, energy, gained, as, heat, q, displaystyle, q, less, the, thermodynamic, work, w, displaystyle, w, done, by, the, system, on, its, surroundings, where, u, displaystyle, delta, u, denotes, the, change, in, the, internal, energy, of, a, closed, system, for, which, heat, or, work, through, the, system, boundary, are, possible, but, matter, transfer, is, not, possible, q, displaystyle, q, denotes, the, quantity, of, energy, supplied, to, the, system, as, heat, and, w, displaystyle, w, denotes, the, amount, of, thermodynamic, work, done, by, the, system, on, its, surroundings, an, equivalent, statement, is, that, perpetual, motion, machines, of, the, first, kind, are, impossible, work, w, displaystyle, w, done, by, a, system, on, its, surrounding, requires, that, the, system, s, internal, energy, u, displaystyle, u, decrease, or, be, consumed, so, that, the, amount, of, internal, energy, lost, by, that, work, must, be, resupplied, as, heat, q, displaystyle, q, by, an, external, energy, source, or, as, work, by, an, external, machine, acting, on, the, system, so, that, u, displaystyle, u, is, recovered, to, make, the, system, work, continuously, for, processes, that, include, transfer, of, matter, a, further, statement, is, needed, with, due, account, of, the, respective, fiducial, reference, states, of, the, systems, when, two, systems, which, may, be, of, different, chemical, compositions, initially, separated, only, by, an, impermeable, wall, and, otherwise, isolated, are, combined, into, a, new, system, by, the, thermodynamic, operation, of, removal, of, the, wall, then, where, u, 0, denotes, the, internal, energy, of, the, combined, system, and, u, 1, and, u, 2, denote, the, internal, energies, of, the, respective, separated, systems, adapted, for, thermodynamics, this, law, is, an, expression, of, the, principle, of, conservation, of, energy, which, states, that, energy, can, be, transformed, changed, from, one, form, to, another, but, cannot, be, created, or, destroyed, internal, energy, is, a, principal, property, of, the, thermodynamic, state, while, heat, and, work, are, modes, of, energy, transfer, by, which, a, process, may, change, this, state, a, change, of, internal, energy, of, a, system, may, be, achieved, by, any, combination, of, heat, added, or, removed, and, work, performed, on, or, by, the, system, as, a, function, of, state, the, internal, energy, does, not, depend, on, the, manner, or, on, the, path, through, intermediate, steps, by, which, the, system, arrived, at, its, state, a, traditional, version, of, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, states, heat, does, not, spontaneously, flow, from, a, colder, body, to, a, hotter, body, the, second, law, refers, to, a, system, of, matter, and, radiation, initially, with, inhomogeneities, in, temperature, pressure, chemical, potential, and, other, intensive, properties, that, are, due, to, internal, constraints, or, impermeable, rigid, walls, within, it, or, to, externally, imposed, forces, the, law, observes, that, when, the, system, is, isolated, from, the, outside, world, and, from, those, forces, there, is, a, definite, thermodynamic, quantity, its, entropy, that, increases, as, the, constraints, are, removed, eventually, reaching, a, maximum, value, at, thermodynamic, equilibrium, when, the, inhomogeneities, practically, vanish, for, systems, that, are, initially, far, from, thermodynamic, equilibrium, though, several, have, been, proposed, there, is, known, no, general, physical, principle, that, determines, the, rates, of, approach, to, thermodynamic, equilibrium, and, thermodynamics, does, not, deal, with, such, rates, the, many, versions, of, the, second, law, all, express, the, general, irreversibility, of, the, transitions, involved, in, systems, approaching, thermodynamic, equilibrium, in, macroscopic, thermodynamics, the, second, law, is, a, basic, observation, applicable, to, any, actual, thermodynamic, process, in, statistical, thermodynamics, the, second, law, is, postulated, to, be, a, consequence, of, molecular, chaos, the, third, law, of, thermodynamics, states, as, the, temperature, of, a, system, approaches, absolute, zero, all, processes, cease, and, the, entropy, of, the, system, approaches, a, minimum, value, this, law, of, thermodynamics, is, a, statistical, law, of, nature, regarding, entropy, and, the, impossibility, of, reaching, absolute, zero, of, temperature, this, law, provides, an, absolute, reference, point, for, the, determination, of, entropy, the, entropy, determined, relative, to, this, point, is, the, absolute, entropy, alternate, definitions, include, the, entropy, of, all, systems, and, of, all, states, of, a, system, is, smallest, at, absolute, zero, or, equivalently, it, is, impossible, to, reach, the, absolute, zero, of, temperature, by, any, finite, number, of, processes, absolute, zero, at, which, all, activity, would, stop, if, it, were, possible, to, achieve, is, 273, 15, c, degrees, celsius, or, 459, 67, f, degrees, fahrenheit, or, 0, k, kelvin, or, 0, r, degrees, rankine, an, important, concept, in, thermodynamics, is, the, thermodynamic, system, which, is, a, precisely, defined, region, of, the, universe, under, study, everything, in, the, universe, except, the, system, is, called, the, surroundings, a, system, is, separated, from, the, remainder, of, the, universe, by, a, boundary, which, may, be, a, physical, or, notional, but, serve, to, confine, the, system, to, a, finite, volume, segments, of, the, boundary, are, often, described, as, walls, they, have, respective, defined, permeabilities, transfers, of, energy, as, work, or, as, heat, or, of, matter, between, the, system, and, the, surroundings, take, place, through, the, walls, according, to, their, respective, permeabilities, matter, or, energy, that, pass, across, the, boundary, so, as, to, effect, a, change, in, the, internal, energy, of, the, system, need, to, be, accounted, for, in, the, energy, balance, equation, the, volume, contained, by, the, walls, can, be, the, region, surrounding, a, single, atom, resonating, energy, such, as, max, planck, defined, in, 1900, it, can, be, a, body, of, steam, or, air, in, a, steam, engine, such, as, sadi, carnot, defined, in, 1824, the, system, could, also, be, just, one, nuclide, i, e, a, system, of, quarks, as, hypothesized, in, quantum, thermodynamics, when, a, looser, viewpoint, is, adopted, and, the, requirement, of, thermodynamic, equilibrium, is, dropped, the, system, can, be, the, body, of, a, tropical, cyclone, such, as, kerry, emanuel, theorized, in, 1986, in, the, field, of, atmospheric, thermodynamics, or, the, event, horizon, of, a, black, hole, boundaries, are, of, four, types, fixed, movable, real, and, imaginary, for, example, in, an, engine, a, fixed, boundary, means, the, piston, is, locked, at, its, position, within, which, a, constant, volume, process, might, occur, if, the, piston, is, allowed, to, move, that, boundary, is, movable, while, the, cylinder, and, cylinder, head, boundaries, are, fixed, for, closed, systems, boundaries, are, real, while, for, open, systems, boundaries, are, often, imaginary, in, the, case, of, a, jet, engine, a, fixed, imaginary, boundary, might, be, assumed, at, the, intake, of, the, engine, fixed, boundaries, along, the, surface, of, the, case, and, a, second, fixed, imaginary, boundary, across, the, exhaust, nozzle, generally, thermodynamics, distinguishes, three, classes, of, systems, defined, in, terms, of, what, is, allowed, to, cross, their, boundaries, as, time, passes, in, an, isolated, system, internal, differences, of, pressures, densities, and, temperatures, tend, to, even, out, a, system, in, which, all, equalizing, processes, have, gone, to, completion, is, said, to, be, in, a, state, of, thermodynamic, equilibrium, once, in, thermodynamic, equilibrium, a, system, s, properties, are, by, definition, unchanging, in, time, systems, in, equilibrium, are, much, simpler, and, easier, to, understand, than, are, systems, which, are, not, in, equilibrium, often, when, analysing, a, dynamic, thermodynamic, process, the, simplifying, assumption, is, made, that, each, intermediate, state, in, the, process, is, at, equilibrium, producing, thermodynamic, processes, which, develop, so, slowly, as, to, allow, each, intermediate, step, to, be, an, equilibrium, state, and, are, said, to, be, reversible, processes, when, a, system, is, at, equilibrium, under, a, given, set, of, conditions, it, is, said, to, be, in, a, definite, thermodynamic, state, the, state, of, the, system, can, be, described, by, a, number, of, state, quantities, that, do, not, depend, on, the, process, by, which, the, system, arrived, at, its, state, they, are, called, intensive, variables, or, extensive, variables, according, to, how, they, change, when, the, size, of, the, system, changes, the, properties, of, the, system, can, be, described, by, an, equation, of, state, which, specifies, the, relationship, between, these, variables, state, may, be, thought, of, as, the, instantaneous, quantitative, description, of, a, system, with, a, set, number, of, variables, held, constant, a, thermodynamic, process, may, be, defined, as, the, energetic, evolution, of, a, thermodynamic, system, proceeding, from, an, initial, state, to, a, final, state, it, can, be, described, by, process, quantities, typically, each, thermodynamic, process, is, distinguished, from, other, processes, in, energetic, character, according, to, what, parameters, such, as, temperature, pressure, or, volume, etc, are, held, fixed, furthermore, it, is, useful, to, group, these, processes, into, pairs, in, which, each, variable, held, constant, is, one, member, of, a, conjugate, pair, several, commonly, studied, thermodynamic, processes, are, there, are, two, types, of, thermodynamic, instruments, the, meter, and, the, reservoir, a, thermodynamic, meter, is, any, device, which, measures, any, parameter, of, a, thermodynamic, system, in, some, cases, the, thermodynamic, parameter, is, actually, defined, in, terms, of, an, idealized, measuring, instrument, for, example, the, zeroth, law, states, that, if, two, bodies, are, in, thermal, equilibrium, with, a, third, body, they, are, also, in, thermal, equilibrium, with, each, other, this, principle, as, noted, by, james, maxwell, in, 1872, asserts, that, it, is, possible, to, measure, temperature, an, idealized, thermometer, is, a, sample, of, an, ideal, gas, at, constant, pressure, from, the, ideal, gas, law, pv, nrt, the, volume, of, such, a, sample, can, be, used, as, an, indicator, of, temperature, in, this, manner, it, defines, temperature, although, pressure, is, defined, mechanically, a, pressure, measuring, device, called, a, barometer, may, also, be, constructed, from, a, sample, of, an, ideal, gas, held, at, a, constant, temperature, a, calorimeter, is, a, device, which, is, used, to, measure, and, define, the, internal, energy, of, a, system, a, thermodynamic, reservoir, is, a, system, which, is, so, large, that, its, state, parameters, are, not, appreciably, altered, when, it, is, brought, into, contact, with, the, system, of, interest, when, the, reservoir, is, brought, into, contact, with, the, system, the, system, is, brought, into, equilibrium, with, the, reservoir, for, example, a, pressure, reservoir, is, a, system, at, a, particular, pressure, which, imposes, that, pressure, upon, the, system, to, which, it, is, mechanically, connected, the, earth, s, atmosphere, is, often, used, as, a, pressure, reservoir, the, ocean, can, act, as, temperature, reservoir, when, used, to, cool, power, plants, the, central, concept, of, thermodynamics, is, that, of, energy, the, ability, to, do, work, by, the, first, law, the, total, energy, of, a, system, and, its, surroundings, is, conserved, energy, may, be, transferred, into, a, system, by, heating, compression, or, addition, of, matter, and, extracted, from, a, system, by, cooling, expansion, or, extraction, of, matter, in, mechanics, for, example, energy, transfer, equals, the, product, of, the, force, applied, to, a, body, and, the, resulting, displacement, conjugate, variables, are, pairs, of, thermodynamic, concepts, with, the, first, being, akin, to, a, force, applied, to, some, thermodynamic, system, the, second, being, akin, to, the, resulting, displacement, and, the, product, of, the, two, equaling, the, amount, of, energy, transferred, the, common, conjugate, variables, are, thermodynamic, potentials, are, different, quantitative, measures, of, the, stored, energy, in, a, system, potentials, are, used, to, measure, the, energy, changes, in, systems, as, they, evolve, from, an, initial, state, to, a, final, state, the, potential, used, depends, on, the, constraints, of, the, system, such, as, constant, temperature, or, pressure, for, example, the, helmholtz, and, gibbs, energies, are, the, energies, available, in, a, system, to, do, useful, work, when, the, temperature, and, volume, or, the, pressure, and, temperature, are, fixed, respectively, thermodynamic, potentials, cannot, be, measured, in, laboratories, but, can, be, computed, using, molecular, thermodynamics, the, five, most, well, known, potentials, are, where, t, displaystyle, t, is, the, temperature, s, displaystyle, s, the, entropy, p, displaystyle, p, the, pressure, v, displaystyle, v, the, volume, displaystyle, mu, the, chemical, potential, n, displaystyle, n, the, number, of, particles, in, the, system, and, i, displaystyle, i, is, the, count, of, particles, types, in, the, system, thermodynamic, potentials, can, be, derived, from, the, energy, balance, equation, applied, to, a, thermodynamic, system, other, thermodynamic, potentials, can, also, be, obtained, through, legendre, transformation, axiomatic, thermodynamics, is, a, mathematical, discipline, that, aims, to, describe, thermodynamics, in, terms, of, rigorous, axioms, for, example, by, finding, a, mathematically, rigorous, way, to, express, the, familiar, laws, of, thermodynamics, the, first, attempt, at, an, axiomatic, theory, of, thermodynamics, was, constantin, carath, odory, s, 1909, work, investigations, on, the, foundations, of, thermodynamics, which, made, use, of, pfaffian, systems, and, the, concept, of, adiabatic, accessibility, a, notion, that, was, introduced, by, carath, odory, himself, in, this, formulation, thermodynamic, concepts, such, as, heat, entropy, and, temperature, are, derived, from, quantities, that, are, more, directly, measurable, theories, that, came, after, differed, in, the, sense, that, they, made, assumptions, regarding, thermodynamic, processes, with, arbitrary, initial, and, final, states, as, opposed, to, considering, only, neighboring, states, the, following, titles, are, more, technical
