rubidium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, rb, and, atomic, number, 37, it, is, a, very, soft, whitish, grey, solid, in, the, alkali, metal, group, similar, to, potassium, and, caesium, rubidium, is, the, first, alkali, metal, in, the, group, to, have, a, density, higher, than, water, on, earth, natural, rubidium, comprises, two, isotopes, 72, is, a, stable, isotope, 85, rb, and, 28, is, slightly, radioactive, 87, rb, with, a, half, life, of, 48, 8, billion, years, more, than, three, times, as, long, as, the, estimated, age, of, the, universe, german, chemists, robert, bunsen, and, gustav, kirchhoff, discovered, rubidium, in, 1861, by, the, newly, developed, technique, flame, spectroscopy, the, name, comes, from, the, latin, word, rubidus, meaning, deep, red, the, color, of, its, emission, spectrum, rubidium, s, compounds, have, various, chemical, and, electronic, applications, rubidium, metal, is, easily, vaporized, and, has, a, convenient, spectral, absorption, range, making, it, a, frequent, target, for, laser, manipulation, of, atoms, rubidium, is, not, a, known, nutrient, for, any, living, organisms, however, rubidium, ions, have, similar, properties, and, the, same, charge, as, potassium, ions, and, are, actively, taken, up, and, treated, by, animal, cells, in, similar, ways, rubidium, is, a, very, soft, ductile, silvery, white, metal, it, has, a, melting, point, of, 39, 3, c, 102, 7, f, and, a, boiling, point, of, 688, c, 1, 270, f, it, forms, amalgams, with, mercury, and, alloys, with, gold, iron, caesium, sodium, and, potassium, but, not, lithium, even, though, rubidium, and, lithium, are, in, the, same, group, rubidium, and, potassium, show, a, very, similar, purple, color, in, the, flame, test, and, distinguishing, the, two, elements, requires, more, sophisticated, analysis, such, as, spectroscopy, rubidium, is, the, second, most, electropositive, of, the, stable, alkali, metals, and, has, a, very, low, first, ionization, energy, of, only, 403, kj, mol, it, has, an, electron, configuration, of, 5s, 1, and, is, photosensitive, due, to, its, strong, electropositive, nature, rubidium, reacts, explosively, with, water, as, with, all, the, alkali, metals, the, reaction, is, usually, vigorous, enough, to, ignite, metal, or, the, hydrogen, gas, produced, by, the, reaction, potentially, causing, an, explosion, rubidium, being, denser, than, potassium, sinks, in, water, reacting, violently, caesium, explodes, on, contact, with, water, rubidium, has, also, been, reported, to, ignite, spontaneously, in, air, rubidium, chloride, rbcl, is, probably, the, most, used, rubidium, compound, among, several, other, chlorides, it, is, used, to, induce, living, cells, to, take, up, dna, it, is, also, used, as, a, biomarker, because, in, nature, it, is, found, only, in, small, quantities, in, living, organisms, and, when, present, replaces, potassium, other, common, rubidium, compounds, are, the, corrosive, rubidium, hydroxide, rboh, the, starting, material, for, most, rubidium, based, chemical, processes, rubidium, carbonate, rb, 2, co, 3, used, in, some, optical, glasses, and, rubidium, copper, sulfate, rb, 2, so, 4, cuso, 4, 6h, 2, o, rubidium, silver, iodide, rbag, 4, i, 5, has, the, highest, room, temperature, conductivity, of, any, known, ionic, crystal, a, property, exploited, in, thin, film, batteries, and, other, applications, rubidium, forms, a, number, of, oxides, when, exposed, to, air, including, rubidium, monoxide, rb, 2, o, rb, 6, o, and, rb, 9, o, 2, rubidium, in, excess, oxygen, gives, the, superoxide, rbo, 2, rubidium, forms, salts, with, halogens, producing, rubidium, fluoride, rubidium, chloride, rubidium, bromide, and, rubidium, iodide, although, rubidium, is, monoisotopic, rubidium, in, the, earth, s, crust, is, composed, of, two, isotopes, the, stable, 85, rb, 72, 2, and, the, radioactive, 87, rb, 27, 8, natural, rubidium, is, radioactive, with, specific, activity, of, about, 670, bq, g, enough, to, significantly, expose, a, photographic, film, in, 110, days, thirty, additional, rubidium, isotopes, have, been, synthesized, with, half, lives, of, less, than, 3, months, most, are, highly, radioactive, and, have, few, uses, rubidium, 87, has, a, half, life, of, 48, 8, 10, 9, years, which, is, more, than, three, times, the, age, of, the, universe, of, 13, 799, 0, 021, 10, 9, years, making, it, a, primordial, nuclide, it, readily, substitutes, for, potassium, in, minerals, and, is, therefore, fairly, widespread, rb, has, been, used, extensively, in, dating, rocks, 87, rb, beta, decays, to, stable, 87, sr, during, fractional, crystallization, sr, tends, to, concentrate, in, plagioclase, leaving, rb, in, the, liquid, phase, hence, the, rb, sr, ratio, in, residual, magma, may, increase, over, time, and, the, progressing, differentiation, results, in, rocks, with, elevated, rb, sr, ratios, the, highest, ratios, 10, or, more, occur, in, pegmatites, if, the, initial, amount, of, sr, is, known, or, can, be, extrapolated, then, the, age, can, be, determined, by, measurement, of, the, rb, and, sr, concentrations, and, of, the, 87, sr, 86, sr, ratio, the, dates, indicate, the, true, age, of, the, minerals, only, if, the, rocks, have, not, been, subsequently, altered, see, rubidium, strontium, dating, rubidium, 82, one, of, the, element, s, non, natural, isotopes, is, produced, by, electron, capture, decay, of, strontium, 82, with, a, half, life, of, 25, 36, days, with, a, half, life, of, 76, seconds, rubidium, 82, decays, by, positron, emission, to, stable, krypton, 82, rubidium, is, not, abundant, being, one, of, 56, elements, that, combined, make, up, 0, 05, of, the, earth, s, crust, at, roughly, the, 23rd, most, abundant, element, in, the, earth, s, crust, it, is, more, abundant, than, zinc, or, copper, 4, it, occurs, naturally, in, the, minerals, leucite, pollucite, carnallite, and, zinnwaldite, which, contain, as, much, as, 1, rubidium, oxide, lepidolite, contains, between, 0, 3, and, 3, 5, rubidium, and, is, the, commercial, source, of, the, element, some, potassium, minerals, and, potassium, chlorides, also, contain, the, element, in, commercially, significant, quantities, seawater, contains, an, average, of, 125, g, l, of, rubidium, compared, to, the, much, higher, value, for, potassium, of, 408, mg, l, and, the, much, lower, value, of, 0, 3, g, l, for, caesium, rubidium, is, the, 18th, most, abundant, element, in, seawater, because, of, its, large, ionic, radius, rubidium, is, one, of, the, incompatible, elements, during, magma, crystallization, rubidium, is, concentrated, together, with, its, heavier, analogue, caesium, in, the, liquid, phase, and, crystallizes, last, therefore, the, largest, deposits, of, rubidium, and, caesium, are, zone, pegmatite, ore, bodies, formed, by, this, enrichment, process, because, rubidium, substitutes, for, potassium, in, the, crystallization, of, magma, the, enrichment, is, far, less, effective, than, that, of, caesium, zone, pegmatite, ore, bodies, containing, mineable, quantities, of, caesium, as, pollucite, or, the, lithium, minerals, lepidolite, are, also, a, source, for, rubidium, as, a, by, product, two, notable, sources, of, rubidium, are, the, rich, deposits, of, pollucite, at, bernic, lake, manitoba, canada, and, the, rubicline, rb, k, alsi, 3, o, 8, found, as, impurities, in, pollucite, on, the, italian, island, of, elba, with, a, rubidium, content, of, 17, 5, both, of, those, deposits, are, also, sources, of, caesium, although, rubidium, is, more, abundant, in, earth, s, crust, than, caesium, the, limited, applications, and, the, lack, of, a, mineral, rich, in, rubidium, limits, the, production, of, rubidium, compounds, to, 2, to, 4, tonnes, per, year, several, methods, are, available, for, separating, potassium, rubidium, and, caesium, the, fractional, crystallization, of, a, rubidium, and, caesium, alum, cs, rb, al, so, 4, 2, 12h, 2, o, yields, after, 30, subsequent, steps, pure, rubidium, alum, two, other, methods, are, reported, the, chlorostannate, process, and, the, ferrocyanide, process, for, several, years, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, a, by, product, of, potassium, production, called, alkarb, was, a, main, source, for, rubidium, alkarb, contained, 21, rubidium, with, the, rest, being, potassium, and, a, small, amount, of, caesium, today, the, largest, producers, of, caesium, produce, rubidium, as, a, by, product, from, pollucite, rubidium, was, discovered, in, 1861, by, robert, bunsen, and, gustav, kirchhoff, in, heidelberg, germany, in, the, mineral, lepidolite, through, flame, spectroscopy, because, of, the, bright, red, lines, in, its, emission, spectrum, they, chose, a, name, derived, from, the, latin, word, rubidus, meaning, deep, red, rubidium, is, a, minor, component, in, lepidolite, kirchhoff, and, bunsen, processed, 150, kg, of, a, lepidolite, containing, only, 0, 24, rubidium, monoxide, rb, 2, o, both, potassium, and, rubidium, form, insoluble, salts, with, chloroplatinic, acid, but, those, salts, show, a, slight, difference, in, solubility, in, hot, water, therefore, the, less, soluble, rubidium, hexachloroplatinate, rb, 2, ptcl, 6, could, be, obtained, by, fractional, crystallization, after, reduction, of, the, hexachloroplatinate, with, hydrogen, the, process, yielded, 0, 51, grams, of, rubidium, chloride, rbcl, for, further, studies, bunsen, and, kirchhoff, began, their, first, large, scale, isolation, of, caesium, and, rubidium, compounds, with, 44, 000, litres, 12, 000, us, gal, of, mineral, water, which, yielded, 7, 3, grams, of, caesium, chloride, and, 9, 2, grams, of, rubidium, chloride, rubidium, was, the, second, element, shortly, after, caesium, to, be, discovered, by, spectroscopy, just, one, year, after, the, invention, of, the, spectroscope, by, bunsen, and, kirchhoff, the, two, scientists, used, the, rubidium, chloride, to, estimate, that, the, atomic, weight, of, the, new, element, was, 85, 36, the, currently, accepted, value, is, 85, 47, they, tried, to, generate, elemental, rubidium, by, electrolysis, of, molten, rubidium, chloride, but, instead, of, a, metal, they, obtained, a, blue, homogeneous, substance, which, neither, under, the, naked, eye, nor, under, the, microscope, showed, the, slightest, trace, of, metallic, substance, they, presumed, that, it, was, a, subchloride, rb, 2, cl, however, the, product, was, probably, a, colloidal, mixture, of, the, metal, and, rubidium, chloride, in, a, second, attempt, to, produce, metallic, rubidium, bunsen, was, able, to, reduce, rubidium, by, heating, charred, rubidium, tartrate, although, the, distilled, rubidium, was, pyrophoric, they, were, able, to, determine, the, density, and, the, melting, point, the, quality, of, this, research, in, the, 1860s, can, be, appraised, by, the, fact, that, their, determined, density, differs, by, less, than, 0, 1, g, cm, 3, and, the, melting, point, by, less, than, 1, c, from, the, presently, accepted, values, the, slight, radioactivity, of, rubidium, was, discovered, in, 1908, but, that, was, before, the, theory, of, isotopes, was, established, in, 1910, and, the, low, level, of, activity, half, life, greater, than, 10, 10, years, made, interpretation, complicated, the, now, proven, decay, of, 87, rb, to, stable, 87, sr, through, beta, decay, was, still, under, discussion, in, the, late, 1940s, rubidium, had, minimal, industrial, value, before, the, 1920s, since, then, the, most, important, use, of, rubidium, is, research, and, development, primarily, in, chemical, and, electronic, applications, in, 1995, rubidium, 87, was, used, to, produce, a, bose, einstein, condensate, for, which, the, discoverers, eric, allin, cornell, carl, edwin, wieman, and, wolfgang, ketterle, won, the, 2001, nobel, prize, in, physics, rubidium, compounds, are, sometimes, used, in, fireworks, to, give, them, a, purple, color, rubidium, has, also, been, considered, for, use, in, a, thermoelectric, generator, using, the, magnetohydrodynamic, principle, whereby, hot, rubidium, ions, are, passed, through, a, magnetic, field, these, conduct, electricity, and, act, like, an, armature, of, a, generator, thereby, generating, an, electric, current, rubidium, particularly, vaporized, 87, rb, is, one, of, the, most, commonly, used, atomic, species, employed, for, laser, cooling, and, bose, einstein, condensation, its, desirable, features, for, this, application, include, the, ready, availability, of, inexpensive, diode, laser, light, at, the, relevant, wavelength, and, the, moderate, temperatures, required, to, obtain, substantial, vapor, pressures, for, cold, atom, applications, requiring, tunable, interactions, 85, rb, is, preferred, for, its, rich, feshbach, spectrum, rubidium, has, been, used, for, polarizing, 3, he, producing, volumes, of, magnetized, 3, he, gas, with, the, nuclear, spins, aligned, rather, than, random, rubidium, vapor, is, optically, pumped, by, a, laser, and, the, polarized, rb, polarizes, 3, he, through, the, hyperfine, interaction, such, spin, polarized, 3, he, cells, are, useful, for, neutron, polarization, measurements, and, for, producing, polarized, neutron, beams, for, other, purposes, the, resonant, element, in, atomic, clocks, utilizes, the, hyperfine, structure, of, rubidium, s, energy, levels, and, rubidium, is, useful, for, high, precision, timing, it, is, used, as, the, main, component, of, secondary, frequency, references, rubidium, oscillators, in, cell, site, transmitters, and, other, electronic, transmitting, networking, and, test, equipment, these, rubidium, standards, are, often, used, with, gnss, to, produce, a, primary, frequency, standard, that, has, greater, accuracy, and, is, less, expensive, than, caesium, standards, such, rubidium, standards, are, often, mass, produced, for, the, telecommunications, industry, other, potential, or, current, uses, of, rubidium, include, a, working, fluid, in, vapor, turbines, as, a, getter, in, vacuum, tubes, and, as, a, photocell, component, rubidium, is, also, used, as, an, ingredient, in, special, types, of, glass, in, the, production, of, superoxide, by, burning, in, oxygen, in, the, study, of, potassium, ion, channels, in, biology, and, as, the, vapor, in, atomic, magnetometers, in, particular, 87, rb, is, used, with, other, alkali, metals, in, the, development, of, spin, exchange, relaxation, free, serf, magnetometers, rubidium, 82, is, used, for, positron, emission, tomography, rubidium, is, very, similar, to, potassium, and, tissue, with, high, potassium, content, will, also, accumulate, the, radioactive, rubidium, one, of, the, main, uses, is, myocardial, perfusion, imaging, as, a, result, of, changes, in, the, blood, brain, barrier, in, brain, tumors, rubidium, collects, more, in, brain, tumors, than, normal, brain, tissue, allowing, the, use, of, radioisotope, rubidium, 82, in, nuclear, medicine, to, locate, and, image, brain, tumors, rubidium, 82, has, a, very, short, half, life, of, 76, seconds, and, the, production, from, decay, of, strontium, 82, must, be, done, close, to, the, patient, rubidium, was, tested, for, the, influence, on, manic, depression, and, depression, dialysis, patients, suffering, from, depression, show, a, depletion, in, rubidium, and, therefore, a, supplementation, may, help, during, depression, in, some, tests, the, rubidium, was, administered, as, rubidium, chloride, with, up, to, 720, mg, per, day, for, 60, days, rubidium, reacts, violently, with, water, and, can, cause, fires, to, ensure, safety, and, purity, this, metal, is, usually, kept, under, dry, mineral, oil, or, sealed, in, glass, ampoules, in, an, inert, atmosphere, rubidium, forms, peroxides, on, exposure, even, to, a, small, amount, of, air, diffused, into, the, oil, and, storage, is, subject, to, similar, precautions, as, the, storage, of, metallic, potassium, rubidium, like, sodium, and, potassium, almost, always, has, 1, oxidation, state, when, dissolved, in, water, even, in, biological, contexts, the, human, body, tends, to, treat, rb, ions, as, if, they, were, potassium, ions, and, therefore, concentrates, rubidium, in, the, body, s, intracellular, fluid, i, e, inside, cells, the, ions, are, not, particularly, toxic, a, 70, kg, person, contains, on, average, 0, 36, g, of, rubidium, and, an, increase, in, this, value, by, 50, to, 100, times, did, not, show, negative, effects, in, test, persons, the, biological, half, life, of, rubidium, in, humans, measures, 31, 46, days, although, a, partial, substitution, of, potassium, by, rubidium, is, possible, when, more, than, 50, of, the, potassium, in, the, muscle, tissue, of, rats, was, replaced, with, rubidium, the, rats, died
