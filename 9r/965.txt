in, physics, lagrangian, mechanics, is, a, formulation, of, classical, mechanics, founded, on, the, stationary, action, principle, also, known, as, the, principle, of, least, action, it, was, introduced, by, the, italian, french, mathematician, and, astronomer, joseph, louis, lagrange, in, his, presentation, to, the, turin, academy, of, science, in, 1760, culminating, in, his, 1788, grand, opus, m, canique, analytique, lagrangian, mechanics, describes, a, mechanical, system, as, a, pair, m, l, consisting, of, a, configuration, space, m, and, a, smooth, function, l, textstyle, l, within, that, space, called, a, lagrangian, for, many, systems, l, t, v, where, t, and, v, are, the, kinetic, and, potential, energy, of, the, system, respectively, the, stationary, action, principle, requires, that, the, action, functional, of, the, system, derived, from, l, must, remain, at, a, stationary, point, a, maximum, minimum, or, saddle, throughout, the, time, evolution, of, the, system, this, constraint, allows, the, calculation, of, the, equations, of, motion, of, the, system, using, lagrange, s, equations, suppose, there, exists, a, bead, sliding, around, on, a, wire, or, a, swinging, simple, pendulum, if, one, tracks, each, of, the, massive, objects, bead, pendulum, bob, as, a, particle, calculation, of, the, motion, of, the, particle, using, newtonian, mechanics, would, require, solving, for, the, time, varying, constraint, force, required, to, keep, the, particle, in, the, constrained, motion, reaction, force, exerted, by, the, wire, on, the, bead, or, tension, in, the, pendulum, rod, for, the, same, problem, using, lagrangian, mechanics, one, looks, at, the, path, the, particle, can, take, and, chooses, a, convenient, set, of, independent, generalized, coordinates, that, completely, characterize, the, possible, motion, of, the, particle, this, choice, eliminates, the, need, for, the, constraint, force, to, enter, into, the, resultant, system, of, equations, there, are, fewer, equations, since, one, is, not, directly, calculating, the, influence, of, the, constraint, on, the, particle, at, a, given, moment, for, a, wide, variety, of, physical, systems, if, the, size, and, shape, of, a, massive, object, are, negligible, it, is, a, useful, simplification, to, treat, it, as, a, point, particle, for, a, system, of, n, point, particles, with, masses, m, 1, m, 2, m, n, each, particle, has, a, position, vector, denoted, r, 1, r, 2, r, n, cartesian, coordinates, are, often, sufficient, so, r, 1, x, 1, y, 1, z, 1, r, 2, x, 2, y, 2, z, 2, and, so, on, in, three, dimensional, space, each, position, vector, requires, three, coordinates, to, uniquely, define, the, location, of, a, point, so, there, are, 3, n, coordinates, to, uniquely, define, the, configuration, of, the, system, these, are, all, specific, points, in, space, to, locate, the, particles, a, general, point, in, space, is, written, r, x, y, z, the, velocity, of, each, particle, is, how, fast, the, particle, moves, along, its, path, of, motion, and, is, the, time, derivative, of, its, position, thus, v, 1, d, r, 1, d, t, v, 2, d, r, 2, d, t, v, n, d, r, n, d, t, displaystyle, mathbf, v, 1, frac, d, mathbf, r, 1, dt, mathbf, v, 2, frac, d, mathbf, r, 2, dt, ldots, mathbf, v, n, frac, d, mathbf, r, n, dt, in, newtonian, mechanics, the, equations, of, motion, are, given, by, newton, s, laws, the, second, law, net, force, equals, mass, times, acceleration, f, m, d, 2, r, d, t, 2, displaystyle, sum, mathbf, f, m, frac, d, 2, mathbf, r, dt, 2, applies, to, each, particle, for, an, n, particle, system, in, 3, dimensions, there, are, 3, n, second, order, ordinary, differential, equations, in, the, positions, of, the, particles, to, solve, for, instead, of, forces, lagrangian, mechanics, uses, the, energies, in, the, system, the, central, quantity, of, lagrangian, mechanics, is, the, lagrangian, a, function, which, summarizes, the, dynamics, of, the, entire, system, overall, the, lagrangian, has, units, of, energy, but, no, single, expression, for, all, physical, systems, any, function, which, generates, the, correct, equations, of, motion, in, agreement, with, physical, laws, can, be, taken, as, a, lagrangian, it, is, nevertheless, possible, to, construct, general, expressions, for, large, classes, of, applications, the, non, relativistic, lagrangian, for, a, system, of, particles, in, the, absence, of, an, electromagnetic, field, is, given, by, l, t, v, displaystyle, l, t, v, where, t, 1, 2, k, 1, n, m, k, v, k, 2, displaystyle, t, frac, 1, 2, sum, k, 1, n, m, k, v, k, 2, is, the, total, kinetic, energy, of, the, system, equaling, the, sum, of, the, kinetic, energies, of, the, n, displaystyle, n, particles, each, particle, labeled, k, displaystyle, k, has, mass, m, k, displaystyle, m, k, and, v, k, 2, v, k, v, k, is, the, magnitude, squared, of, its, velocity, equivalent, to, the, dot, product, of, the, velocity, with, itself, kinetic, energy, t, t, v, 1, v, 2, is, the, energy, of, the, system, s, motion, and, is, a, function, only, of, the, velocities, v, k, not, the, positions, r, k, nor, time, t, so, t, t, v, 1, v, 2, v, the, potential, energy, of, the, system, reflects, the, energy, of, interaction, between, the, particles, i, e, how, much, energy, any, one, particle, has, due, to, all, the, others, together, with, any, external, influences, for, conservative, forces, e, g, newtonian, gravity, it, is, a, function, of, the, position, vectors, of, the, particles, only, so, v, v, r, 1, r, 2, for, those, non, conservative, forces, which, can, be, derived, from, an, appropriate, potential, e, g, electromagnetic, potential, the, velocities, will, appear, also, v, v, r, 1, r, 2, v, 1, v, 2, if, there, is, some, external, field, or, external, driving, force, changing, with, time, the, potential, changes, with, time, so, most, generally, v, v, r, 1, r, 2, v, 1, v, 2, t, as, already, noted, this, form, of, l, is, applicable, to, many, important, classes, of, system, but, not, everywhere, for, relativistic, lagrangian, mechanics, it, must, be, replaced, as, a, whole, by, a, function, consistent, with, special, or, general, relativity, where, a, magnetic, field, is, present, the, expression, for, the, potential, energy, needs, restating, and, for, dissipative, forces, e, g, friction, another, function, must, be, introduced, alongside, l, one, or, more, of, the, particles, may, each, be, subject, to, one, or, more, holonomic, constraints, such, a, constraint, is, described, by, an, equation, of, the, form, f, r, t, 0, if, the, number, of, constraints, in, the, system, is, c, then, each, constraint, has, an, equation, f, 1, r, t, 0, f, 2, r, t, 0, f, c, r, t, 0, each, of, which, could, apply, to, any, of, the, particles, if, particle, k, is, subject, to, constraint, i, then, f, i, r, k, t, 0, at, any, instant, of, time, the, coordinates, of, a, constrained, particle, are, linked, together, and, not, independent, the, constraint, equations, determine, the, allowed, paths, the, particles, can, move, along, but, not, where, they, are, or, how, fast, they, go, at, every, instant, of, time, nonholonomic, constraints, depend, on, the, particle, velocities, accelerations, or, higher, derivatives, of, position, lagrangian, mechanics, can, only, be, applied, to, systems, whose, constraints, if, any, are, all, holonomic, three, examples, of, nonholonomic, constraints, are, when, the, constraint, equations, are, nonintegrable, when, the, constraints, have, inequalities, or, with, complicated, non, conservative, forces, like, friction, nonholonomic, constraints, require, special, treatment, and, one, may, have, to, revert, to, newtonian, mechanics, or, use, other, methods, if, t, or, v, or, both, depend, explicitly, on, time, due, to, time, varying, constraints, or, external, influences, the, lagrangian, l, r, 1, r, 2, v, 1, v, 2, t, is, explicitly, time, dependent, if, neither, the, potential, nor, the, kinetic, energy, depend, on, time, then, the, lagrangian, l, r, 1, r, 2, v, 1, v, 2, is, explicitly, independent, of, time, in, either, case, the, lagrangian, always, has, implicit, time, dependence, through, the, generalized, coordinates, with, these, definitions, lagrange, s, equations, of, the, first, kind, are, l, r, k, d, d, t, l, r, k, i,

i, partial, mathbf, r, k, 0, where, k, 1, 2, n, labels, the, particles, there, is, a, lagrange, multiplier, i, for, each, constraint, equation, f, i, and, r, k, x, k, y, k, z, k, r, k, x, k, y, k, z,

derivatives, with, respect, to, the, indicated, variables, not, a, derivative, with, respect, to, the, entire, vector, each, overdot, is, a, shorthand, for, a, time, derivative, this, procedure, does, increase, the, number, of, equations, to, solve, compared, to, newton, s, laws, from, 3, n, to, 3, n, c, because, there, are, 3, n, coupled, second, order, differential, equations, in, the, position, coordinates, and, multipliers, plus, c, constraint, equations, however, when, solved, alongside, the, position, coordinates, of, the, particles, the, multipliers, can, yield, information, about, the, constraint, forces, the, coordinates, do, not, need, to, be, eliminated, by, solving, the, constraint, equations, in, the, lagrangian, the, position, coordinates, and, velocity, components, are, all, independent, variables, and, derivatives, of, the, lagrangian, are, taken, with, respect, to, these, separately, according, to, the, usual, differentiation, rules, e, g, the, partial, derivative, of, l, with, respect, to, the, z, velocity, component, of, particle, 2, defined, by, v, z, 2, dz, 2, dt, is, just, l, v, z, 2, no, awkward, chain, rules, or, total, derivatives, need, to, be, used, to, relate, the, velocity, component, to, the, corresponding, coordinate, z, 2, in, each, constraint, equation, one, coordinate, is, redundant, because, it, is, determined, from, the, other, coordinates, the, number, of, independent, coordinates, is, therefore, n, 3, n, c, we, can, transform, each, position, vector, to, a, common, set, of, n, generalized, coordinates, conveniently, written, as, an, n, tuple, q, q, 1, q, 2, q, n, by, expressing, each, position, vector, and, hence, the, position, coordinates, as, functions, of, the, generalized, coordinates, and, time, r, k, r, k, q, t, x, k, q, t, y, k, q, t, z, k, q, t, t, displaystyle, mathbf, r, k, mathbf, r, k, mathbf, q, t, big, x, k, mathbf, q, t, y, k, mathbf, q, t, z, k, mathbf, q, t, t, big, the, vector, q, is, a, point, in, the, configuration, space, of, the, system, the, time, derivatives, of, the, generalized, coordinates, are, called, the, generalized, velocities, and, for, each, particle, the, transformation, of, its, velocity, vector, the, total, derivative, of, its, position, with, respect, to, time, is, q, j, d, q, j, d, t, v, k, j, 1, n, r, k, q, j, q, j, r, k, t, displaystyle, dot, q, j, frac, mathrm, d, q, j, mathrm, d, t, quad, mathbf, v, k, sum, j, 1, n, frac, partial, mathbf, r, k, partial, q, j, dot, q, j, frac, partial, mathbf, r, k, partial, t, given, this, v, k, the, kinetic, energy, in, generalized, coordinates, depends, on, the, generalized, velocities, generalized, coordinates, and, time, if, the, position, vectors, depend, explicitly, on, time, due, to, time, varying, constraints, so, t, t, q, q, t, displaystyle, t, t, mathbf, q, dot, mathbf, q, t, with, these, definitions, the, euler, lagrange, equations, or, lagrange, s, equations, of, the, second, kind, d, d, t, l, q, j, l, q, j, displaystyle, frac, mathrm, d, mathrm, d, t, left, frac, partial, l, partial, dot, q, j, right, frac, partial, l, partial, q, j, are, mathematical, results, from, the, calculus, of, variations, which, can, also, be, used, in, mechanics, substituting, in, the, lagrangian, l, q, d, q, d, t, t, gives, the, equations, of, motion, of, the, system, the, number, of, equations, has, decreased, compared, to, newtonian, mechanics, from, 3, n, to, n, 3, n, c, coupled, second, order, differential, equations, in, the, generalized, coordinates, these, equations, do, not, include, constraint, forces, at, all, only, non, constraint, forces, need, to, be, accounted, for, although, the, equations, of, motion, include, partial, derivatives, the, results, of, the, partial, derivatives, are, still, ordinary, differential, equations, in, the, position, coordinates, of, the, particles, the, total, time, derivative, denoted, d, d, t, often, involves, implicit, differentiation, both, equations, are, linear, in, the, lagrangian, but, generally, are, nonlinear, coupled, equations, in, the, coordinates, for, simplicity, newton, s, laws, can, be, illustrated, for, one, particle, without, much, loss, of, generality, for, a, system, of, n, particles, all, of, these, equations, apply, to, each, particle, in, the, system, the, equation, of, motion, for, a, particle, of, constant, mass, m, is, newton, s, second, law, of, 1687, in, modern, vector, notation, f, m, a, displaystyle, mathbf, f, m, mathbf, a, where, a, is, its, acceleration, and, f, the, resultant, force, acting, on, it, where, the, mass, is, varying, the, equation, needs, to, be, generalised, to, take, the, time, derivative, of, the, momentum, in, three, spatial, dimensions, this, is, a, system, of, three, coupled, second, order, ordinary, differential, equations, to, solve, since, there, are, three, components, in, this, vector, equation, the, solution, is, the, position, vector, r, of, the, particle, at, time, t, subject, to, the, initial, conditions, of, r, and, v, when, t, 0, newton, s, laws, are, easy, to, use, in, cartesian, coordinates, but, cartesian, coordinates, are, not, always, convenient, and, for, other, coordinate, systems, the, equations, of, motion, can, become, complicated, in, a, set, of, curvilinear, coordinates, 1, 2, 3, the, law, in, tensor, index, notation, is, the, lagrangian, form, f, a, m, d, 2, a, d, t, 2, a, b, c, d, b, d, t, d, c, d, t, g, a, k, d, d, t, t, k, t, k, a, d, a, d, t, displaystyle, f, a, m, left, frac, mathrm, d, 2, xi, a, mathrm, d, t, 2,

bc, are, the, christoffel, symbols, of, the, second, kind, t, 1, 2, m, g, b, c, d, b, d, t, d, c, d, t, displaystyle, t, frac, 1, 2, mg, bc, frac, mathrm, d, xi, b, mathrm, d, t, frac, mathrm, d, xi, c, mathrm, d, t, is, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, particle, and, g, bc, the, covariant, components, of, the, metric, tensor, of, the, curvilinear, coordinate, system, all, the, indices, a, b, c, each, take, the, values, 1, 2, 3, curvilinear, coordinates, are, not, the, same, as, generalized, coordinates, it, may, seem, like, an, overcomplication, to, cast, newton, s, law, in, this, form, but, there, are, advantages, the, acceleration, components, in, terms, of, the, christoffel, symbols, can, be, avoided, by, evaluating, derivatives, of, the, kinetic, energy, instead, if, there, is, no, resultant, force, acting, on, the, particle, f, 0, it, does, not, accelerate, but, moves, with, constant, velocity, in, a, straight, line, mathematically, the, solutions, of, the, differential, equation, are, geodesics, the, curves, of, extremal, length, between, two, points, in, space, these, may, end, up, being, minimal, that, is, the, shortest, paths, but, not, necessarily, in, flat, 3d, real, space, the, geodesics, are, simply, straight, lines, so, for, a, free, particle, newton, s, second, law, coincides, with, the, geodesic, equation, and, states, that, free, particles, follow, geodesics, the, extremal, trajectories, it, can, move, along, if, the, particle, is, subject, to, forces, f, 0, the, particle, accelerates, due, to, forces, acting, on, it, and, deviates, away, from, the, geodesics, it, would, follow, if, free, with, appropriate, extensions, of, the, quantities, given, here, in, flat, 3d, space, to, 4d, curved, spacetime, the, above, form, of, newton, s, law, also, carries, over, to, einstein, s, general, relativity, in, which, case, free, particles, follow, geodesics, in, curved, spacetime, that, are, no, longer, straight, lines, in, the, ordinary, sense, however, we, still, need, to, know, the, total, resultant, force, f, acting, on, the, particle, which, in, turn, requires, the, resultant, non, constraint, force, n, plus, the, resultant, constraint, force, c, f, c, n, displaystyle, mathbf, f, mathbf, c, mathbf, n, the, constraint, forces, can, be, complicated, since, they, generally, depend, on, time, also, if, there, are, constraints, the, curvilinear, coordinates, are, not, independent, but, related, by, one, or, more, constraint, equations, the, constraint, forces, can, either, be, eliminated, from, the, equations, of, motion, so, only, the, non, constraint, forces, remain, or, included, by, including, the, constraint, equations, in, the, equations, of, motion, a, fundamental, result, in, analytical, mechanics, is, d, alembert, s, principle, introduced, in, 1708, by, jacques, bernoulli, to, understand, static, equilibrium, and, developed, by, d, alembert, in, 1743, to, solve, dynamical, problems, the, principle, asserts, for, n, particles, the, virtual, work, i, e, the, work, along, a, virtual, displacement, r, k, is, zero, k, 1, n, n, k, c, k, m, k, a, k, r, k, 0, displaystyle, sum, k, 1, n, mathbf, n, k, mathbf, c, k, m, k, mathbf, a, k, cdot, delta, mathbf, r, k, 0, the, virtual, displacements, r, k, are, by, definition, infinitesimal, changes, in, the, configuration, of, the, system, consistent, with, the, constraint, forces, acting, on, the, system, at, an, instant, of, time, i, e, in, such, a, way, that, the, constraint, forces, maintain, the, constrained, motion, they, are, not, the, same, as, the, actual, displacements, in, the, system, which, are, caused, by, the, resultant, constraint, and, non, constraint, forces, acting, on, the, particle, to, accelerate, and, move, it, virtual, work, is, the, work, done, along, a, virtual, displacement, for, any, force, constraint, or, non, constraint, since, the, constraint, forces, act, perpendicular, to, the, motion, of, each, particle, in, the, system, to, maintain, the, constraints, the, total, virtual, work, by, the, constraint, forces, acting, on, the, system, is, zero, k, 1, n, c, k, r, k, 0, displaystyle, sum, k, 1, n, mathbf, c, k, cdot, delta, mathbf, r, k, 0, so, that, k, 1, n, n, k, m, k, a, k, r, k, 0, displaystyle, sum, k, 1, n, mathbf, n, k, m, k, mathbf, a, k, cdot, delta, mathbf, r, k, 0, thus, d, alembert, s, principle, allows, us, to, concentrate, on, only, the, applied, non, constraint, forces, and, exclude, the, constraint, forces, in, the, equations, of, motion, the, form, shown, is, also, independent, of, the, choice, of, coordinates, however, it, cannot, be, readily, used, to, set, up, the, equations, of, motion, in, an, arbitrary, coordinate, system, since, the, displacements, r, k, might, be, connected, by, a, constraint, equation, which, prevents, us, from, setting, the, n, individual, summands, to, 0, we, will, therefore, seek, a, system, of, mutually, independent, coordinates, for, which, the, total, sum, will, be, 0, if, and, only, if, the, individual, summands, are, 0, setting, each, of, the, summands, to, 0, will, eventually, give, us, our, separated, equations, of, motion, if, there, are, constraints, on, particle, k, then, since, the, coordinates, of, the, position, r, k, x, k, y, k, z, k, are, linked, together, by, a, constraint, equation, so, are, those, of, the, virtual, displacements, r, k, x, k, y, k, z, k, since, the, generalized, coordinates, are, independent, we, can, avoid, the, complications, with, the, r, k, by, converting, to, virtual, displacements, in, the, generalized, coordinates, these, are, related, in, the, same, form, as, a, total, differential, r, k, j, 1, n, r, k, q, j, q, j, displaystyle, delta, mathbf, r, k, sum, j, 1, n, frac, partial, mathbf, r, k, partial, q, j, delta, q, j, there, is, no, partial, time, derivative, with, respect, to, time, multiplied, by, a, time, increment, since, this, is, a, virtual, displacement, one, along, the, constraints, in, an, instant, of, time, the, first, term, in, d, alembert, s, principle, above, is, the, virtual, work, done, by, the, non, constraint, forces, n, k, along, the, virtual, displacements, r, k, and, can, without, loss, of, generality, be, converted, into, the, generalized, analogues, by, the, definition, of, generalized, forces, q, j, k, 1, n, n, k, r, k, q, j, displaystyle, q, j, sum, k, 1, n, mathbf, n, k, cdot, frac, partial, mathbf, r, k, partial, q, j, so, that, k, 1, n, n, k, r, k, k, 1, n, n, k, j, 1, n, r, k, q, j, q, j, j, 1, n, q, j, q, j, displaystyle, sum, k, 1, n, mathbf, n, k, cdot, delta, mathbf, r, k, sum, k, 1, n, mathbf, n, k, cdot, sum, j, 1, n, frac, partial, mathbf, r, k, partial, q, j, delta, q, j, sum, j, 1, n, q, j, delta, q, j, this, is, half, of, the, conversion, to, generalized, coordinates, it, remains, to, convert, the, acceleration, term, into, generalized, coordinates, which, is, not, immediately, obvious, recalling, the, lagrange, form, of, newton, s, second, law, the, partial, derivatives, of, the, kinetic, energy, with, respect, to, the, generalized, coordinates, and, velocities, can, be, found, to, give, the, desired, result, k, 1, n, m, k, a, k, r, k, q, j, d, d, t, t, q, j, t, q, j, displaystyle, sum, k, 1, n, m, k, mathbf, a, k, cdot, frac, partial, mathbf, r, k, partial, q, j, frac, mathrm, d, mathrm, d, t, frac, partial, t, partial, dot, q, j, frac, partial, t, partial, q, j, now, d, alembert, s, principle, is, in, the, generalized, coordinates, as, required, j, 1, n, q, j, d, d, t, t, q, j, t, q, j, q, j, 0, displaystyle, sum, j, 1, n, left, delta, q, j, 0, and, since, these, virtual, displacements, q, j, are, independent, and, nonzero, the, coefficients, can, be, equated, to, zero, resulting, in, lagrange, s, equations, or, the, generalized, equations, of, motion, q, j, d, d, t, t, q, j, t, q, j, displaystyle, q, j, frac, mathrm, d, mathrm, d, t, frac, partial, t, partial,

using, the, generalized, coordinates, r, and, simply, following, the, lagrangian, formulation, without, thinking, about, frames, at, all, the, interpretation, is, that, the, centrifugal, force, is, an, outgrowth, of, using, polar, coordinates, as, hildebrand, says, since, such, quantities, are, not, true, physical, forces, they, are, often, called, inertia, forces, their, presence, or, absence, depends, not, upon, the, particular, problem, at, hand, but, upon, the, coordinate, system, chosen, in, particular, if, cartesian, coordinates, are, chosen, the, centrifugal, force, disappears, and, the, formulation, involves, only, the, central, force, itself, which, provides, the, centripetal, force, for, a, curved, motion, this, viewpoint, that, fictitious, forces, originate, in, the, choice, of, coordinates, often, is, expressed, by, users, of, the, lagrangian, method, this, view, arises, naturally, in, the, lagrangian, approach, because, the, frame, of, reference, is, possibly, unconsciously, selected, by, the, choice, of, coordinates, for, example, see, for, a, comparison, of, lagrangians, in, an, inertial, and, in, a, noninertial, frame, of, reference, see, also, the, discussion, of, total, and, updated, lagrangian, formulations, in, unfortunately, this, usage, of, inertial, force, conflicts, with, the, newtonian, idea, of, an, inertial, force, in, the, newtonian, view, an, inertial, force, originates, in, the, acceleration, of, the, frame, of, observation, the, fact, that, it, is, not, an, inertial, frame, of, reference, not, in, the, choice, of, coordinate, system, to, keep, matters, clear, it, is, safest, to, refer, to, the, lagrangian, inertial, forces, as, generalized, inertial, forces, to, distinguish, them, from, the, newtonian, vector, inertial, forces, that, is, one, should, avoid, following, hildebrand, when, he, says, p, 155, we, deal, always, with, generalized, forces, velocities, accelerations, and, momenta, for, brevity, the, adjective, generalized, will, be, omitted, frequently, it, is, known, that, the, lagrangian, of, a, system, is, not, unique, within, the, lagrangian, formalism, the, newtonian, fictitious, forces, can, be, identified, by, the, existence, of, alternative, lagrangians, in, which, the, fictitious, forces, disappear, sometimes, found, by, exploiting, the, symmetry, of, the, system, dissipation, i, e, non, conservative, systems, can, also, be, treated, with, an, effective, lagrangian, formulated, by, a, certain, doubling, of, the, degrees, of, freedom, in, a, more, general, formulation, the, forces, could, be, both, conservative, and, viscous, if, an, appropriate, transformation, can, be, found, from, the, f, i, rayleigh, suggests, using, a, dissipation, function, d, of, the, following, form, d,

insignificant, it, is, often, a, hypothetical, simplified, point, particle, with, no, properties, other, than, mass, and, charge, real, particles, like, electrons, and, up, quarks, are, more, complex, and, have, additional, terms, in, their, lagrangians, not, only, can, the, fields, form, non, conservative, potentials, these, potentials, can, also, be, velocity, dependent, the, lagrangian, for, a, charged, particle, with, electrical, charge, q, interacting, with, an, electromagnetic, field, is, the, prototypical, example, of, a, velocity, dependent, potential, the, electric, scalar, potential,

when, the, common, rule, of, thumb, that, the, lagrangian, is, the, kinetic, energy, minus, the, potential, energy, is, incorrect, combined, with, euler, lagrange, equation, it, produces, the,

prescription, in, quantum, mechanics, and, quantum, field, theory, from, this, expression, we, can, see, that, the, canonical, momentum, p, is, not, gauge, invariant, and, therefore, not, a, measurable, physical, quantity, however, if, r, is, cyclic, i, e, lagrangian, is, independent, of, position, r, which, happens, if, the, and, a, fields, are, uniform, then, this, canonical, momentum, p, given, here, is, the, conserved, momentum, while, the, measurable, physical, kinetic, momentum, m, v, is, not, the, ideas, in, lagrangian, mechanics, have, numerous, applications, in, other, areas, of, physics, and, can, adopt, generalized, results, from, the, calculus, of, variations, a, closely, related, formulation, of, classical, mechanics, is, hamiltonian, mechanics, the, hamiltonian, is,

the, lagrangian, which, introduces, new, variables, canonically, conjugate, to, the, original, variables, for, example, given, a, set, of, generalized, coordinates, the, variables, canonically, conjugate, are, the, generalized, momenta, this, doubles, the, number, of, variables, but, makes, differential, equations, first, order, the, hamiltonian, is, a, particularly, ubiquitous, quantity, in, quantum, mechanics, see, hamiltonian, quantum, mechanics, routhian, mechanics, is, a, hybrid, formulation, of, lagrangian, and, hamiltonian, mechanics, which, is, not, often, used, in, practice, but, an, efficient, formulation, for, cyclic, coordinates, the, euler, lagrange, equations, can, also, be, formulated, in, terms, of, the, generalized, momenta, rather, than, generalized, coordinates, performing, a, legendre, transformation, on, the, generalized, coordinate, lagrangian, l, q, d, q, d, t, t, obtains, the, generalized, momenta, lagrangian, l, p, d, p, d, t, t, in, terms, of, the, original, lagrangian, as, well, the, el, equations, in, terms, of, the, generalized, momenta, both, lagrangians, contain, the, same, information, and, either, can, be, used, to, solve, for, the, motion, of, the, system, in, practice, generalized, coordinates, are, more, convenient, to, use, and, interpret, than, generalized, momenta, there, is, no, mathematical, reason, to, restrict, the, derivatives, of, generalized, coordinates, to, first, order, only, it, is, possible, to, derive, modified, el, equations, for, a, lagrangian, containing, higher, order, derivatives, see, euler, lagrange, equation, for, details, however, from, the, physical, point, of, view, there, is, an, obstacle, to, include, time, derivatives, higher, than, the, first, order, which, is, implied, by, ostrogradsky, s, construction, of, a, canonical, formalism, for, nondegenerate, higher, derivative, lagrangians, see, ostrogradsky, instability, lagrangian, mechanics, can, be, applied, to, geometrical, optics, by, applying, variational, principles, to, rays, of, light, in, a, medium, and, solving, the, el, equations, gives, the, equations, of, the, paths, the, light, rays, follow, lagrangian, mechanics, can, be, formulated, in, special, relativity, and, general, relativity, some, features, of, lagrangian, mechanics, are, retained, in, the, relativistic, theories, but, difficulties, quickly, appear, in, other, respects, in, particular, the, el, equations, take, the, same, form, and, the, connection, between, cyclic, coordinates, and, conserved, momenta, still, applies, however, the, lagrangian, must, be, modified, and, is, not, simply, the, kinetic, minus, the, potential, energy, of, a, particle, also, it, is, not, straightforward, to, handle, multiparticle, systems, in, a, manifestly, covariant, way, it, may, be, possible, if, a, particular, frame, of, reference, is, singled, out, in, quantum, mechanics, action, and, quantum, mechanical, phase, are, related, via, the, planck, constant, and, the, principle, of, stationary, action, can, be, understood, in, terms, of, constructive, interference, of, wave, functions, in, 1948, feynman, discovered, the, path, integral, formulation, extending, the, principle, of, least, action, to, quantum, mechanics, for, electrons, and, photons, in, this, formulation, particles, travel, every, possible, path, between, the, initial, and, final, states, the, probability, of, a, specific, final, state, is, obtained, by, summing, over, all, possible, trajectories, leading, to, it, in, the, classical, regime, the, path, integral, formulation, cleanly, reproduces, hamilton, s, principle, and, fermat, s, principle, in, optics, in, lagrangian, mechanics, the, generalized, coordinates, form, a, discrete, set, of, variables, that, define, the, configuration, of, a, system, in, classical, field, theory, the, physical, system, is, not, a, set, of, discrete, particles, but, rather, a, continuous, field, r, t, defined, over, a, region, of, 3d, space, associated, with, the, field, is, a, lagrangian, density, l, r, t, displaystyle, mathcal, l, phi, nabla, phi, dot, phi, mathbf, r, t, defined, in, terms, of, the, field, and, its, space, and, time, derivatives, at, a, location, r, and, time, t, analogous, to, the, particle, case, for, non, relativistic, applications, the, lagrangian, density, is, also, the, kinetic, energy, density, of, the, field, minus, its, potential, energy, density, this, is, not, true, in, general, and, the, lagrangian, density, has, to, be, reverse, engineered, the, lagrangian, is, then, the, volume, integral, of, the, lagrangian, density, over, 3d, space, l, t, l, d, 3, r, displaystyle, l, t, int, mathcal, l, mathrm, d, 3, mathbf, r, where, d, 3, r, is, a, 3d, differential, volume, element, the, lagrangian, is, a, function, of, time, since, the, lagrangian, density, has, implicit, space, dependence, via, the, fields, and, may, have, explicit, spatial, dependence, but, these, are, removed, in, the, integral, leaving, only, time, in, as, the, variable, for, the, lagrangian, the, action, principle, and, the, lagrangian, formalism, are, tied, closely, to, noether, s, theorem, which, connects, physical, conserved, quantities, to, continuous, symmetries, of, a, physical, system, if, the, lagrangian, is, invariant, under, a, symmetry, then, the, resulting, equations, of, motion, are, also, invariant, under, that, symmetry, this, characteristic, is, very, helpful, in, showing, that, theories, are, consistent, with, either, special, relativity, or, general, relativity
