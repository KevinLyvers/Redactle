the, pleiades, p, l, i, d, i, z, p, l, e, p, l, a, also, known, as, the, seven, sisters, and, messier, 45, is, an, asterism, of, an, open, star, cluster, containing, middle, aged, hot, b, type, stars, in, the, northwest, of, the, constellation, taurus, at, a, distance, of, about, 444, light, years, it, is, among, the, nearest, star, clusters, to, earth, and, the, nearest, messier, object, to, earth, being, the, most, obvious, star, cluster, to, the, naked, eye, in, the, night, sky, it, is, also, observed, to, house, the, reflection, nebula, ngc, 1432, an, hii, region, the, cluster, is, dominated, by, hot, blue, luminous, stars, that, have, formed, within, the, last, 100, million, years, reflection, nebulae, around, the, brightest, stars, were, once, thought, to, be, leftover, material, from, their, formation, but, are, now, considered, likely, to, be, an, unrelated, dust, cloud, in, the, interstellar, medium, through, which, the, stars, are, currently, passing, this, dust, cloud, is, estimated, to, be, moving, at, a, speed, of, approximately, 18, km, s, relative, to, the, stars, in, the, cluster, computer, simulations, have, shown, that, the, pleiades, were, probably, formed, from, a, compact, configuration, that, once, resembled, the, orion, nebula, astronomers, estimate, that, the, cluster, will, survive, for, approximately, another, 250, million, years, after, which, the, clustering, will, be, lost, due, to, gravitational, interactions, with, the, galactic, neighborhood, together, with, the, open, star, cluster, of, the, hyades, the, pleiades, form, the, golden, gate, of, the, ecliptic, the, name, pleiades, comes, from, ancient, greek, it, probably, derives, from, plein, to, sail, because, of, the, cluster, s, importance, in, delimiting, the, sailing, season, in, the, mediterranean, sea, the, season, of, navigation, began, with, their, heliacal, rising, in, classical, greek, mythology, the, name, was, used, for, seven, divine, sisters, called, the, pleiades, in, time, the, name, was, said, to, be, derived, from, that, of, a, mythical, mother, pleione, effectively, meaning, daughters, of, pleione, in, reality, the, ancient, name, of, the, star, cluster, related, to, sailing, almost, certainly, came, first, in, the, culture, naming, of, a, relationship, to, the, sister, deities, followed, and, eventually, appearing, in, later, myths, to, interpret, the, group, name, a, mother, pleione, the, m45, group, played, an, important, role, in, ancient, times, for, the, establishment, of, many, calendars, thanks, to, the, combination, of, two, remarkable, elements, the, first, which, is, still, valid, is, its, unique, and, perfectly, identifiable, aspect, on, the, celestial, vault, near, the, ecliptic, the, second, essential, for, the, ancients, is, that, in, the, middle, of, the, third, millennium, bc, this, asterism, a, prominent, pattern, or, group, of, stars, that, is, smaller, than, a, constellation, marked, the, vernal, point, the, importance, of, this, asterism, is, also, evident, in, northern, europe, the, pleiades, cluster, is, displayed, on, the, nebra, sky, disc, that, was, found, in, germany, and, is, dated, to, around, 1600, bc, on, the, disk, the, cluster, is, represented, in, a, high, position, between, the, sun, and, the, moon, this, asterism, also, marks, the, beginning, of, several, ancient, calendars, although, m45, is, no, longer, at, the, vernal, point, the, asterism, still, remains, important, both, functionally, and, symbolically, in, addition, to, the, changes, in, the, calendars, based, on, the, lunar, stations, among, the, indians, and, the, arabs, consider, the, case, of, an, ancient, yemeni, calendar, in, which, the, months, are, designated, according, to, an, astronomical, criterion, that, caused, it, to, be, named, calendar, of, the, pleiades, the, month, of, ams, literally, five, is, that, during, which, the, sun, and, al, urayy, i, e, the, pleiades, deviate, from, each, other, by, five, movements, of, the, moon, i, e, five, times, the, path, that, the, moon, travels, on, average, in, one, day, and, one, night, to, use, the, terminology, of, abd, al, rahman, al, sufi, in, turkic, mythology, the, pleiades, constellation, is, one, of, the, oldest, cosmological, figures, of, the, turks, seasonal, cycles, in, anatolia, are, determined, by, this, star, group, the, pleiades, are, a, prominent, sight, in, winter, in, the, northern, hemisphere, and, are, easily, visible, from, mid, southern, latitudes, they, have, been, known, since, antiquity, to, cultures, all, around, the, world, including, the, celts, welsh, t, r, tewdws, irish, streoill, n, pre, colonial, filipinos, who, called, it, map, lon, mulo, pulo, or, mur, p, ro, among, other, names, for, whom, it, indicated, the, beginning, of, the, year, hawaiians, who, call, them, makali, i, m, ori, who, call, them, matariki, indigenous, australians, from, several, traditions, the, achaemenid, empire, whence, in, persians, who, called, them, parv, n, or, parv, the, arabs, who, call, them, al, thurayy, the, chinese, who, called, them, m, o, the, quechua, who, call, them, qullqa, or, the, storehouse, the, japanese, who, call, them, subaru, the, maya, the, aztec, the, sioux, the, kiowa, and, the, cherokee, in, hinduism, the, pleiades, are, known, as, k, ttik, and, are, scripturally, associated, with, the, war, deity, kartikeya, and, are, also, identified, or, associated, with, the, saptamatrika, s, seven, mothers, hindus, celebrate, the, first, day, new, moon, of, the, month, of, kartik, as, diwali, a, festival, of, abundance, and, lamps, the, pleiades, are, also, mentioned, three, times, in, the, bible, the, earliest, known, depiction, of, the, pleiades, is, likely, a, northern, german, bronze, age, artifact, known, as, the, nebra, sky, disk, dated, to, approximately, 1600, bc, the, babylonian, star, catalogues, name, the, pleiades, mul, mul, meaning, stars, literally, star, star, and, they, head, the, list, of, stars, along, the, ecliptic, reflecting, the, fact, that, they, were, close, to, the, point, of, the, vernal, equinox, around, the, twenty, third, century, bc, the, ancient, egyptians, may, have, used, the, names, followers, and, ennead, in, the, prognosis, texts, of, the, calendar, of, lucky, and, unlucky, days, of, papyrus, cairo, 86637, some, greek, astronomers, considered, them, to, be, a, distinct, constellation, and, they, are, mentioned, by, hesiod, s, works, and, days, homer, s, iliad, and, odyssey, and, the, geoponica, the, pleiades, was, the, most, well, known, star, among, pre, islamic, arabs, and, so, often, referred, to, simply, as, the, star, an, najm, some, scholars, of, islam, suggested, that, the, pleiades, are, the, star, mentioned, in, surah, an, najm, the, star, in, the, quran, on, numerous, cylinder, seals, from, the, beginning, of, the, first, millennium, bc, m45, is, represented, by, seven, points, while, the, seven, gods, appear, on, low, reliefs, of, neo, assyrian, royal, palaces, wearing, long, open, robes, and, large, cylindrical, headdresses, surmounted, by, short, feathers, and, adorned, with, three, frontal, rows, of, horns, and, a, crown, of, feathers, while, carrying, both, an, ax, and, a, knife, as, well, as, a, bow, and, a, quiver, as, noted, by, scholar, stith, thompson, the, constellation, was, nearly, always, imagined, as, a, group, of, seven, sisters, and, their, myths, explain, why, there, are, only, six, some, scientists, suggest, that, these, may, come, from, observations, back, when, pleione, was, farther, from, atlas, and, more, visible, as, a, separate, star, as, far, back, as, 100, 000, bc, in, japan, the, cluster, is, mentioned, under, the, name, mutsuraboshi, six, stars, in, the, eighth, century, kojiki, the, cluster, is, now, known, in, japan, as, subaru, the, name, was, chosen, for, that, of, the, subaru, telescope, the, 8, 2, meter, 320, in, flagship, telescope, of, the, national, astronomical, observatory, of, japan, located, at, the, mauna, kea, observatory, on, the, island, of, hawaii, it, had, the, largest, monolithic, primary, mirror, in, the, world, from, its, commissioning, in, 1998, until, 2005, it, also, was, chosen, as, the, brand, name, of, subaru, automobiles, to, reflect, the, origins, of, the, firm, as, the, joining, of, five, companies, and, is, depicted, in, the, firm, s, six, star, logo, galileo, galilei, was, the, first, astronomer, to, view, the, pleiades, through, a, telescope, he, thereby, discovered, that, the, cluster, contains, many, stars, too, dim, to, be, seen, with, the, naked, eye, he, published, his, observations, including, a, sketch, of, the, pleiades, showing, 36, stars, in, his, treatise, sidereus, nuncius, in, march, 1610, the, pleiades, have, long, been, known, to, be, a, physically, related, group, of, stars, rather, than, any, chance, alignment, john, michell, calculated, in, 1767, that, the, probability, of, a, chance, alignment, of, so, many, bright, stars, was, only, 1, in, 500, 000, and, so, surmised, that, the, pleiades, and, many, other, clusters, must, consist, of, physically, related, stars, when, studies, were, first, made, of, the, proper, motions, of, the, stars, it, was, found, that, they, are, all, moving, in, the, same, direction, across, the, sky, at, the, same, rate, further, demonstrating, that, they, were, related, charles, messier, measured, the, position, of, the, cluster, and, included, it, as, m45, in, his, catalogue, of, comet, like, objects, published, in, 1771, along, with, the, orion, nebula, and, the, praesepe, cluster, messier, s, inclusion, of, the, pleiades, has, been, noted, as, curious, as, most, of, messier, s, objects, were, much, fainter, and, more, easily, confused, with, comets, something, that, seems, scarcely, possible, for, the, pleiades, one, possibility, is, that, messier, simply, wanted, to, have, a, larger, catalogue, than, his, scientific, rival, lacaille, whose, 1755, catalogue, contained, 42, objects, and, so, he, added, some, bright, well, known, objects, to, boost, the, number, on, his, list, edme, s, bastien, jeaurat, then, drew, in, 1782, a, map, of, 64, stars, of, the, pleiades, from, his, observations, in, 1779, which, he, published, in, 1786, the, distance, to, the, pleiades, can, be, used, as, a, key, first, step, to, calibrate, the, cosmic, distance, ladder, as, the, cluster, is, relatively, close, to, the, earth, the, distance, should, be, relatively, easy, to, measure, and, has, been, estimated, by, many, methods, accurate, knowledge, of, the, distance, allows, astronomers, to, plot, a, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, for, the, cluster, which, when, compared, with, those, plotted, for, clusters, whose, distance, is, not, known, allows, their, distances, to, be, estimated, other, methods, may, then, extend, the, distance, scale, from, open, clusters, to, galaxies, and, clusters, of, galaxies, and, a, cosmic, distance, ladder, may, be, constructed, ultimately, astronomers, understanding, of, the, age, and, future, evolution, of, the, universe, is, influenced, by, their, knowledge, of, the, distance, to, the, pleiades, yet, some, authors, argue, that, the, controversy, over, the, distance, to, the, pleiades, discussed, below, is, a, red, herring, since, the, cosmic, distance, ladder, can, presently, rely, on, a, suite, of, other, nearby, clusters, where, consensus, exists, regarding, the, distances, as, established, by, the, hipparcos, satellite, and, independent, means, e, g, the, hyades, the, coma, berenices, cluster, etc, measurements, of, the, distance, have, elicited, much, controversy, results, prior, to, the, launch, of, the, hipparcos, satellite, generally, found, that, the, pleiades, were, approximately, 135, parsecs, pc, away, from, earth, data, from, hipparcos, yielded, a, surprising, result, namely, a, distance, of, only, 118, pc, by, measuring, the, parallax, of, stars, in, the, cluster, a, technique, that, should, yield, the, most, direct, and, accurate, results, later, work, consistently, argued, that, the, hipparcos, distance, measurement, for, the, pleiades, was, erroneous, in, particular, distances, derived, to, the, cluster, via, the, hubble, space, telescope, and, infrared, color, magnitude, diagram, fitting, so, called, spectroscopic, parallax, favor, a, distance, between, 135, and, 140, pc, a, dynamical, distance, from, optical, interferometric, observations, of, the, inner, pair, of, stars, within, atlas, a, bright, triple, star, in, the, pleiades, favors, a, distance, of, 133, to, 137, pc, however, the, author, of, the, 2007, 2009, catalog, of, revised, hipparcos, parallaxes, reasserted, that, the, distance, to, the, pleiades, is, 120, pc, and, challenged, the, dissenting, evidence, in, 2012, francis, and, anderson, proposed, that, a, systematic, effect, on, hipparcos, parallax, errors, for, stars, in, clusters, would, bias, calculation, using, the, weighted, mean, they, gave, a, hipparcos, parallax, distance, of, 126, pc, and, photometric, distance, of, 132, pc, based, on, stars, in, the, ab, doradus, tucana, horologium, and, beta, pictoris, moving, groups, which, are, all, similar, in, age, and, composition, to, the, pleiades, those, authors, note, that, the, difference, between, these, results, may, be, attributed, to, random, error, more, recent, results, using, very, long, baseline, interferometry, vlbi, august, 2014, and, preliminary, solutions, using, gaia, data, release, 1, september, 2016, and, gaia, data, release, 2, august, 2018, determine, distances, of, 136, 2, 1, 2, pc, 134, 6, pc, and, 136, 2, 5, 0, pc, respectively, the, gaia, data, release, 1, team, were, cautious, about, their, result, and, the, vlbi, authors, assert, that, the, hipparcos, measured, distance, to, the, pleiades, cluster, is, in, error, the, most, recent, distance, estimate, of, the, distance, to, the, pleiades, based, on, the, gaia, data, release, 3, is, 135, 74, 0, 10, pc, the, cluster, core, radius, is, approximately, 8, light, years, and, tidal, radius, is, approximately, 43, light, years, the, cluster, contains, more, than, 1, 000, statistically, confirmed, members, not, counting, the, number, that, would, be, added, if, all, binary, stars, could, be, resolved, its, light, is, dominated, by, young, hot, blue, stars, up, to, 14, of, which, may, be, seen, with, the, naked, eye, depending, on, local, observing, conditions, and, visual, acuity, of, the, observer, the, brightest, stars, form, a, shape, somewhat, similar, to, that, of, ursa, major, and, ursa, minor, the, total, mass, contained, in, the, cluster, is, estimated, to, be, approximately, 800, solar, masses, and, is, dominated, by, fainter, and, redder, stars, an, estimate, of, the, frequency, of, binary, stars, in, the, pleiades, is, approximately, 57, the, cluster, contains, many, brown, dwarfs, such, as, teide, 1, these, are, objects, with, less, than, approximately, 8, of, the, sun, s, mass, insufficient, for, nuclear, fusion, reactions, to, start, in, their, cores, and, become, proper, stars, they, may, constitute, up, to, 25, of, the, total, population, of, the, cluster, although, they, contribute, less, than, 2, of, the, total, mass, astronomers, have, made, great, efforts, to, find, and, analyze, brown, dwarfs, in, the, pleiades, and, other, young, clusters, because, they, are, still, relatively, bright, and, observable, while, brown, dwarfs, in, older, clusters, have, faded, and, are, much, more, difficult, to, study, the, brightest, stars, of, the, cluster, are, named, the, seven, sisters, in, early, greek, mythology, sterope, merope, electra, maia, taygeta, celaeno, and, alcyone, later, they, were, assigned, parents, pleione, and, atlas, as, daughters, of, atlas, the, hyades, were, sisters, of, the, pleiades, the, following, table, gives, details, of, the, brightest, stars, in, the, cluster, ages, for, star, clusters, may, be, estimated, by, comparing, the, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, for, the, cluster, with, theoretical, models, of, stellar, evolution, using, this, technique, ages, for, the, pleiades, of, between, 75, and, 150, million, years, have, been, estimated, the, wide, spread, in, estimated, ages, is, a, result, of, uncertainties, in, stellar, evolution, models, which, include, factors, such, as, convective, overshoot, in, which, a, convective, zone, within, a, star, penetrates, an, otherwise, non, convective, zone, resulting, in, higher, apparent, ages, another, way, of, estimating, the, age, of, the, cluster, is, by, looking, at, the, lowest, mass, objects, in, normal, main, sequence, stars, lithium, is, rapidly, destroyed, in, nuclear, fusion, reactions, brown, dwarfs, can, retain, their, lithium, however, due, to, lithium, s, very, low, ignition, temperature, of, 2, 5, 10, 6, k, the, highest, mass, brown, dwarfs, will, burn, it, eventually, and, so, determining, the, highest, mass, of, brown, dwarfs, still, containing, lithium, in, the, cluster, may, give, an, idea, of, its, age, applying, this, technique, to, the, pleiades, gives, an, age, of, about, 115, million, years, the, cluster, is, slowly, moving, in, the, direction, of, the, feet, of, what, is, currently, the, constellation, of, orion, like, most, open, clusters, the, pleiades, will, not, stay, gravitationally, bound, forever, some, component, stars, will, be, ejected, after, close, encounters, with, other, stars, others, will, be, stripped, by, tidal, gravitational, fields, calculations, suggest, that, the, cluster, will, take, approximately, 250, million, years, to, disperse, because, of, gravitational, interactions, with, giant, molecular, clouds, and, the, spiral, arms, of, our, galaxy, hastening, its, demise, with, larger, amateur, telescopes, the, nebulosity, around, some, of, the, stars, may, be, easily, seen, especially, when, long, exposure, photographs, are, taken, under, ideal, observing, conditions, some, hint, of, nebulosity, around, the, cluster, may, be, seen, even, with, small, telescopes, or, average, binoculars, it, is, a, reflection, nebula, caused, by, dust, reflecting, the, blue, light, of, the, hot, young, stars, it, was, formerly, thought, that, the, dust, was, left, over, from, the, formation, of, the, cluster, but, at, the, age, of, approximately, 100, million, years, generally, accepted, for, the, cluster, almost, all, the, dust, originally, present, would, have, been, dispersed, by, radiation, pressure, instead, it, seems, that, the, cluster, is, simply, passing, through, a, particularly, dusty, region, of, the, interstellar, medium, studies, show, that, the, dust, responsible, for, the, nebulosity, is, not, uniformly, distributed, but, is, concentrated, mainly, in, two, layers, along, the, line, of, sight, to, the, cluster, these, layers, may, have, been, formed, by, deceleration, due, to, radiation, pressure, as, the, dust, has, moved, toward, the, stars, analyzing, deep, infrared, images, obtained, by, the, spitzer, space, telescope, and, gemini, north, telescope, astronomers, discovered, that, one, of, the, stars, in, the, cluster, hd, 23514, which, has, a, mass, and, luminosity, a, bit, greater, than, that, of, the, sun, is, surrounded, by, an, extraordinary, number, of, hot, dust, particles, this, could, be, evidence, for, planet, formation, around, hd, 23514
