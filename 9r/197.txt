a, molecular, cloud, sometimes, called, a, stellar, nursery, if, star, formation, is, occurring, within, is, a, type, of, interstellar, cloud, the, density, and, size, of, which, permit, absorption, nebulae, the, formation, of, molecules, most, commonly, molecular, hydrogen, h, 2, and, the, formation, of, h, ii, regions, this, is, in, contrast, to, other, areas, of, the, interstellar, medium, that, contain, predominantly, ionized, gas, molecular, hydrogen, is, difficult, to, detect, by, infrared, and, radio, observations, so, the, molecule, most, often, used, to, determine, the, presence, of, h, 2, is, carbon, monoxide, co, the, ratio, between, co, luminosity, and, h, 2, mass, is, thought, to, be, constant, although, there, are, reasons, to, doubt, this, assumption, in, observations, of, some, other, galaxies, within, molecular, clouds, are, regions, with, higher, density, where, much, dust, and, many, gas, cores, reside, called, clumps, these, clumps, are, the, beginning, of, star, formation, if, gravitational, forces, are, sufficient, to, cause, the, dust, and, gas, to, collapse, the, history, pertaining, to, the, discovery, of, molecular, clouds, is, closely, related, to, the, development, of, radio, astronomy, and, astrochemistry, during, world, war, ii, at, a, small, gathering, of, scientists, henk, van, de, hulst, first, reported, he, had, calculated, the, neutral, hydrogen, atom, should, transmit, a, detectable, radio, signal, this, discovery, was, an, important, step, towards, the, research, that, would, eventually, lead, to, the, detection, of, molecular, clouds, once, the, war, ended, and, aware, of, the, pioneering, radio, astronomical, observations, performed, by, jansky, and, reber, in, the, us, the, dutch, astronomers, repurposed, the, dish, shaped, antennas, running, along, the, dutch, coastline, that, were, once, used, by, the, germans, as, a, warning, radar, system, and, modified, into, radio, telescopes, initiating, the, search, for, the, hydrogen, signature, in, the, depths, of, space, the, neutral, hydrogen, atom, consists, of, a, proton, with, an, electron, in, its, orbit, both, the, proton, and, the, electron, have, a, spin, property, when, the, spin, state, flips, from, a, parallel, condition, to, antiparallel, which, contains, less, energy, the, atom, gets, rid, of, the, excess, energy, by, radiating, a, spectral, line, at, a, frequency, of, 1420, 405, mhz, this, frequency, is, generally, known, as, the, 21, cm, line, referring, to, its, wavelength, in, the, radio, band, the, 21, cm, line, is, the, signature, of, hi, and, makes, the, gas, detectable, to, astronomers, back, on, earth, the, discovery, of, the, 21, cm, line, was, the, first, step, towards, the, technology, that, would, allow, astronomers, to, detect, compounds, and, molecules, in, interstellar, space, in, 1951, two, research, groups, nearly, simultaneously, discovered, radio, emission, from, interstellar, neutral, hydrogen, ewen, and, purcell, reported, the, detection, of, the, 21, cm, line, in, march, 1951, using, the, radio, telescope, at, the, kootwijk, observatory, muller, and, oort, reported, the, detection, of, the, hydrogen, emission, line, in, may, of, that, same, year, once, the, 21, cm, emission, line, was, detected, radio, astronomers, began, mapping, the, neutral, hydrogen, distribution, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, van, de, hulst, muller, and, oort, aided, by, a, team, of, astronomers, from, australia, published, the, leiden, sydney, map, of, neutral, hydrogen, in, the, galactic, disk, in, 1958, on, the, monthly, notices, of, the, royal, astronomical, society, this, was, the, first, neutral, hydrogen, map, of, the, galactic, disc, and, also, the, first, map, showing, the, spiral, arm, structure, within, it, following, the, work, on, atomic, hydrogen, detection, by, van, de, hulst, oort, and, others, astronomers, began, to, regularly, use, radio, telescopes, this, time, looking, for, interstellar, molecules, in, 1963, alan, barrett, and, sander, weinred, at, mit, found, the, emission, line, of, oh, in, the, supernova, remnant, cassiopeia, a, this, was, the, first, radio, detection, of, an, interstellar, molecule, at, radio, wavelengths, more, interstellar, oh, detections, quickly, followed, and, in, 1965, harold, weaver, and, his, team, of, radio, astronomers, at, berkeley, identified, oh, emissions, lines, coming, from, the, direction, of, the, orion, nebula, and, in, the, constellation, of, cassiopeia, in, 1968, cheung, rank, townes, thornton, and, welch, detected, nh, inversion, line, radiation, in, interstellar, space, a, year, later, lewis, snyder, and, his, colleagues, found, interstellar, formaldehyde, also, in, the, same, year, george, carruthers, managed, to, identify, molecular, hydrogen, the, numerous, detections, of, molecules, in, interstellar, space, would, help, pave, the, way, to, the, discovery, of, molecular, clouds, in, 1970, hydrogen, is, the, most, abundant, species, of, atom, in, molecular, clouds, and, under, the, right, conditions, it, will, form, the, h, 2, molecule, despite, its, abundance, the, detection, of, h, 2, proved, difficult, due, to, its, symmetrical, molecule, h, 2, molecules, have, a, weak, rotational, and, vibrational, modes, making, it, virtually, invisible, to, direct, observation, the, solution, to, this, problem, came, when, arno, penzias, keith, jefferts, and, robert, wilson, identified, co, in, the, star, forming, region, in, the, omega, nebula, carbon, monoxide, is, a, lot, easier, to, detect, than, h, 2, because, of, its, rotational, energy, and, asymmetrical, structure, co, soon, became, the, primary, tracer, of, the, clouds, where, star, formation, occurs, in, 1970, penzias, and, his, team, quickly, detected, co, in, other, locations, close, to, the, galactic, center, including, the, giant, molecular, cloud, identified, as, sagittarius, b2, 390, light, years, from, the, galactic, center, making, it, the, first, detection, of, a, molecular, cloud, in, history, this, team, later, would, receive, the, nobel, prize, of, physics, for, their, discovery, of, microwave, emission, from, the, big, bang, due, to, their, pivotal, role, research, about, these, structures, have, only, increased, over, time, a, paper, published, in, 2022, reports, over, 10, 000, molecular, clouds, detected, since, the, discovery, of, sagittarius, b2, within, the, milky, way, molecular, gas, clouds, account, for, less, than, one, percent, of, the, volume, of, the, interstellar, medium, ism, yet, it, is, also, the, densest, part, of, it, the, bulk, of, the, molecular, gas, is, contained, in, a, ring, between, 3, 5, and, 7, 5, kiloparsecs, 11, 000, and, 24, 000, light, years, from, the, center, of, the, milky, way, the, sun, is, about, 8, 5, kiloparsecs, from, the, center, large, scale, co, maps, of, the, galaxy, show, that, the, position, of, this, gas, correlates, with, the, spiral, arms, of, the, galaxy, that, molecular, gas, occurs, predominantly, in, the, spiral, arms, suggests, that, molecular, clouds, must, form, and, dissociate, on, a, timescale, shorter, than, 10, million, years, the, time, it, takes, for, material, to, pass, through, the, arm, region, perpendicularly, to, the, plane, of, the, galaxy, the, molecular, gas, inhabits, the, narrow, midplane, of, the, galactic, disc, with, a, characteristic, scale, height, z, of, approximately, 50, to, 75, parsecs, much, thinner, than, the, warm, atomic, z, from, 130, to, 400, parsecs, and, warm, ionized, z, around, 1000, parsecs, gaseous, components, of, the, ism, the, exceptions, to, the, ionized, gas, distribution, are, h, ii, regions, which, are, bubbles, of, hot, ionized, gas, created, in, molecular, clouds, by, the, intense, radiation, given, off, by, young, massive, stars, and, as, such, they, have, approximately, the, same, vertical, distribution, as, the, molecular, gas, this, distribution, of, molecular, gas, is, averaged, out, over, large, distances, however, the, small, scale, distribution, of, the, gas, is, highly, irregular, with, most, of, it, concentrated, in, discrete, clouds, and, cloud, complexes, molecular, clouds, typically, have, interstellar, medium, densities, of, 10, to, 30, cm, 3, and, constitute, approximately, 50, of, the, total, interstellar, gas, in, a, galaxy, most, of, the, gas, is, found, in, a, molecular, state, the, visual, boundaries, of, a, molecular, cloud, is, not, where, the, cloud, effectively, ends, but, where, molecular, gas, changes, to, atomic, gas, in, a, fast, transition, forming, envelopes, of, mass, giving, the, impression, of, an, edge, to, the, cloud, structure, the, structure, itself, is, generally, irregular, and, filamentary, cosmic, dust, and, ultraviolet, radiation, emitted, by, stars, are, key, factors, that, determine, not, only, gas, and, column, density, but, also, the, molecular, composition, of, a, cloud, the, dust, provides, shielding, to, the, molecular, gas, inside, preventing, dissociation, by, the, ultraviolet, radiation, the, dissociation, caused, by, uv, photons, is, the, main, mechanism, for, transforming, molecular, material, back, to, the, atomic, state, inside, the, cloud, molecular, content, in, a, region, of, a, molecular, cloud, can, change, rapidly, due, to, variation, in, the, radiation, field, and, dust, movement, and, disturbance, most, of, the, gas, constituting, a, molecular, cloud, is, molecular, hydrogen, with, carbon, monoxide, being, the, second, most, common, compound, molecular, clouds, also, usually, contain, other, elements, and, compounds, astronomers, have, observed, the, presence, of, long, chain, compounds, such, as, methanol, ethanol, and, benzene, rings, and, their, several, hydrides, large, molecules, known, as, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons, have, also, been, detected, the, density, across, a, molecular, cloud, is, fragmented, and, its, regions, can, be, generally, categorized, in, clumps, and, cores, clumps, form, the, larger, substructure, of, the, cloud, having, the, average, size, of, 1, pc, clumps, are, the, precursors, of, star, clusters, though, not, every, clump, will, eventually, form, stars, cores, are, much, smaller, by, a, factor, of, 10, and, have, higher, densities, cores, are, gravitationally, bound, and, go, through, a, collapse, during, star, formation, in, astronomical, terms, molecular, clouds, are, short, lived, structures, that, are, either, destroyed, or, go, through, major, structural, and, chemical, changes, approximately, 10, million, years, into, their, existence, their, short, life, span, can, be, inferred, from, the, range, in, age, of, young, stars, associated, with, them, of, 10, to, 20, million, years, matching, molecular, clouds, internal, timescales, direct, observation, of, t, tauri, stars, inside, dark, clouds, and, ob, stars, in, star, forming, regions, match, this, predicted, age, span, the, fact, ob, stars, older, than, 10, million, years, don, t, have, a, significant, amount, of, cloud, material, about, them, seems, to, suggest, most, of, the, cloud, is, dispersed, after, this, time, the, lack, of, large, amounts, of, frozen, molecules, inside, the, clouds, also, suggest, a, short, lived, structure, some, astronomers, propose, the, molecules, never, froze, in, very, large, quantities, due, to, turbulence, and, the, fast, transition, between, atomic, and, molecular, gas, due, to, their, short, lifespan, it, follows, that, molecular, clouds, are, constantly, being, assembled, and, destroyed, by, calculating, the, rate, at, which, stars, are, forming, in, our, galaxy, astronomers, are, able, to, suggest, the, amount, of, interstellar, gas, being, collected, into, star, forming, molecular, clouds, in, our, galaxy, the, rate, of, mass, being, assembled, into, stars, is, approximately, 3, m, per, year, only, 2, of, the, mass, of, a, molecular, cloud, is, assembled, into, stars, giving, the, number, of, 150, m, of, gas, being, assembled, in, molecular, clouds, in, the, milky, way, per, year, two, possible, mechanisms, for, molecular, cloud, formation, have, been, suggested, by, astronomers, cloud, growth, by, collision, and, gravitational, instability, in, the, gas, layer, spread, throughout, the, galaxy, models, for, the, collision, theory, have, shown, it, cannot, be, the, main, mechanism, for, cloud, formation, due, to, the, very, long, timescale, it, would, take, to, form, a, molecular, cloud, beyond, the, average, lifespan, of, such, structures, gravitational, instability, is, likely, to, be, the, main, mechanism, those, regions, with, more, gas, will, exert, a, greater, gravitational, force, on, their, neighboring, regions, and, draw, surrounding, material, this, extra, material, increases, the, density, increasing, their, gravitational, attraction, mathematical, models, of, gravitational, instability, in, the, gas, layer, predict, a, formation, time, within, the, timescale, for, the, estimated, cloud, formation, time, once, a, molecular, cloud, assembles, enough, mass, the, densest, regions, of, the, structure, will, start, to, collapse, under, gravity, creating, star, forming, clusters, this, process, is, highly, destructive, to, the, cloud, itself, once, stars, are, formed, they, begin, to, ionize, portions, of, the, cloud, around, it, due, to, their, heat, the, ionized, gas, then, evaporates, and, is, dispersed, in, formations, called, champagne, flows, this, process, begins, when, approximately, 2, of, the, mass, of, the, cloud, has, been, converted, into, stars, stellar, winds, are, also, known, to, contribute, to, cloud, dispersal, the, cycle, of, cloud, formation, and, destruction, is, closed, when, the, gas, dispersed, by, stars, cools, again, and, is, pulled, into, new, clouds, by, gravitational, instability, star, formation, involves, the, collapse, of, the, densest, part, of, the, molecular, cloud, fragmenting, the, collapsed, region, in, smaller, clumps, these, clumps, aggregate, more, interstellar, material, increasing, in, density, by, gravitational, contraction, this, process, continues, until, the, temperature, reaches, a, point, where, the, fusion, of, hydrogen, can, occur, the, burning, of, hydrogen, then, generates, enough, heat, to, push, against, gravity, creating, hydrostatic, equilibrium, at, this, stage, a, protostar, is, formed, and, it, will, continue, to, aggregate, gas, and, dust, from, the, cloud, around, it, one, of, the, most, studied, star, formation, regions, is, the, taurus, molecular, cloud, due, to, its, close, proximity, to, earth, 140, pc, or, 430, ly, away, making, it, an, excellent, object, to, collect, data, about, the, relationship, between, molecular, clouds, and, star, formation, embedded, in, the, taurus, molecular, cloud, there, are, t, tauri, stars, these, are, a, class, of, variable, stars, in, an, early, stage, of, stellar, development, and, still, gathering, gas, and, dust, from, the, cloud, around, them, observation, of, star, forming, regions, have, helped, astronomers, develop, theories, about, stellar, evolution, many, o, and, b, type, stars, have, been, observed, in, or, very, near, molecular, clouds, since, these, star, types, belong, to, population, i, some, are, less, than, 1, million, years, old, they, cannot, have, moved, far, from, their, birth, place, many, of, these, young, stars, are, found, embedded, in, cloud, clusters, suggesting, stars, are, formed, inside, it, a, vast, assemblage, of, molecular, gas, that, has, more, than, 10, thousand, times, the, mass, of, the, sun, is, called, a, giant, molecular, cloud, gmc, gmcs, are, around, 15, to, 600, light, years, 5, to, 200, parsecs, in, diameter, with, typical, masses, of, 10, thousand, to, 10, million, solar, masses, whereas, the, average, density, in, the, solar, vicinity, is, one, particle, per, cubic, centimetre, the, average, volume, density, of, a, gmc, is, about, ten, to, a, thousand, times, higher, although, the, sun, is, much, denser, than, a, gmc, the, volume, of, a, gmc, is, so, great, that, it, contains, much, more, mass, than, the, sun, the, substructure, of, a, gmc, is, a, complex, pattern, of, filaments, sheets, bubbles, and, irregular, clumps, filaments, are, truly, ubiquitous, in, the, molecular, cloud, dense, molecular, filaments, will, fragment, into, gravitationally, bound, cores, most, of, which, will, evolve, into, stars, continuous, accretion, of, gas, geometrical, bending, and, magnetic, fields, may, control, the, detailed, fragmentation, manner, of, the, filaments, in, supercritical, filaments, observations, have, revealed, quasi, periodic, chains, of, dense, cores, with, spacing, of, 0, 15, parsec, comparable, to, the, filament, inner, width, a, substantial, fraction, of, filaments, contained, prestellar, and, protostellar, cores, supporting, the, important, role, of, filaments, in, gravitationally, bound, core, formation, recent, studies, have, suggested, that, filamentary, structures, in, molecular, clouds, play, a, crucial, role, in, the, initial, conditions, of, star, formation, and, the, origin, of, the, stellar, imf, the, densest, parts, of, the, filaments, and, clumps, are, called, molecular, cores, while, the, densest, molecular, cores, are, called, dense, molecular, cores, and, have, densities, in, excess, of, 10, 4, to, 10, 6, particles, per, cubic, centimeter, typical, molecular, cores, are, traced, with, co, and, dense, molecular, cores, are, traced, with, ammonia, the, concentration, of, dust, within, molecular, cores, is, normally, sufficient, to, block, light, from, background, stars, so, that, they, appear, in, silhouette, as, dark, nebulae, gmcs, are, so, large, that, local, ones, can, cover, a, significant, fraction, of, a, constellation, thus, they, are, often, referred, to, by, the, name, of, that, constellation, e, g, the, orion, molecular, cloud, omc, or, the, taurus, molecular, cloud, tmc, these, local, gmcs, are, arrayed, in, a, ring, in, the, neighborhood, of, the, sun, coinciding, with, the, gould, belt, the, most, massive, collection, of, molecular, clouds, in, the, galaxy, forms, an, asymmetrical, ring, about, the, galactic, center, at, a, radius, of, 120, parsecs, the, largest, component, of, this, ring, is, the, sagittarius, b2, complex, the, sagittarius, region, is, chemically, rich, and, is, often, used, as, an, exemplar, by, astronomers, searching, for, new, molecules, in, interstellar, space, isolated, gravitationally, bound, small, molecular, clouds, with, masses, less, than, a, few, hundred, times, that, of, the, sun, are, called, bok, globules, the, densest, parts, of, small, molecular, clouds, are, equivalent, to, the, molecular, cores, found, in, gmcs, and, are, often, included, in, the, same, studies, in, 1984, iras, identified, a, new, type, of, diffuse, molecular, cloud, these, were, diffuse, filamentary, clouds, that, are, visible, at, high, galactic, latitudes, these, clouds, have, a, typical, density, of, 30, particles, per, cubic, centimetre
