a, thrust, fault, is, a, break, in, the, earth, s, crust, across, which, older, rocks, are, pushed, above, younger, rocks, a, thrust, fault, is, a, type, of, reverse, fault, that, has, a, dip, of, 45, degrees, or, less, if, the, angle, of, the, fault, plane, is, lower, often, less, than, 15, degrees, from, the, horizontal, and, the, displacement, of, the, overlying, block, is, large, often, in, the, kilometer, range, the, fault, is, called, an, overthrust, or, overthrust, fault, erosion, can, remove, part, of, the, overlying, block, creating, a, fenster, or, window, when, the, underlying, block, is, exposed, only, in, a, relatively, small, area, when, erosion, removes, most, of, the, overlying, block, leaving, island, like, remnants, resting, on, the, lower, block, the, remnants, are, called, klippen, singular, klippe, if, the, fault, plane, terminates, before, it, reaches, the, earth, s, surface, it, is, called, a, blind, thrust, fault, because, of, the, lack, of, surface, evidence, blind, thrust, faults, are, difficult, to, detect, until, rupture, the, destructive, 1994, earthquake, in, northridge, los, angeles, california, was, caused, by, a, previously, undiscovered, blind, thrust, fault, because, of, their, low, dip, thrusts, are, also, difficult, to, appreciate, in, mapping, where, lithological, offsets, are, generally, subtle, and, stratigraphic, repetition, is, difficult, to, detect, especially, in, peneplain, areas, thrust, faults, particularly, those, involved, in, thin, skinned, style, of, deformation, have, a, so, called, ramp, flat, geometry, thrusts, mainly, propagate, along, zones, of, weakness, within, a, sedimentary, sequence, such, as, mudstones, or, halite, layers, these, parts, of, the, thrust, are, called, decollements, if, the, effectiveness, of, the, decollement, becomes, reduced, the, thrust, will, tend, to, cut, up, the, section, to, a, higher, stratigraphic, level, until, it, reaches, another, effective, decollement, where, it, can, continue, as, bedding, parallel, flat, the, part, of, the, thrust, linking, the, two, flats, is, known, as, a, ramp, and, typically, forms, at, an, angle, of, about, 15, 30, to, the, bedding, continued, displacement, on, a, thrust, over, a, ramp, produces, a, characteristic, fold, geometry, known, as, a, ramp, anticline, or, more, generally, as, a, fault, bend, fold, fault, propagation, folds, form, at, the, tip, of, a, thrust, fault, where, propagation, along, the, decollement, has, ceased, but, displacement, on, the, thrust, behind, the, fault, tip, continues, the, formation, of, an, asymmetric, anticline, syncline, fold, pair, accommodates, the, continuing, displacement, as, displacement, continues, the, thrust, tip, starts, to, propagate, along, the, axis, of, the, syncline, such, structures, are, also, known, as, tip, line, folds, eventually, the, propagating, thrust, tip, may, reach, another, effective, decollement, layer, and, a, composite, fold, structure, will, develop, with, fault, bending, and, fault, propagation, folds, characteristics, duplexes, occur, where, two, decollement, levels, are, close, to, each, other, within, a, sedimentary, sequence, such, as, the, top, and, base, of, a, relatively, strong, sandstone, layer, bounded, by, two, relatively, weak, mudstone, layers, when, a, thrust, that, has, propagated, along, the, lower, detachment, known, as, the, floor, thrust, cuts, up, to, the, upper, detachment, known, as, the, roof, thrust, it, forms, a, ramp, within, the, stronger, layer, with, continued, displacement, on, the, thrust, higher, stresses, are, developed, in, the, footwall, of, the, ramp, due, to, the, bend, on, the, fault, this, may, cause, renewed, propagation, along, the, floor, thrust, until, it, again, cuts, up, to, join, the, roof, thrust, further, displacement, then, takes, place, via, the, newly, created, ramp, this, process, may, repeat, many, times, forming, a, series, of, fault, bounded, thrust, slices, known, as, imbricates, or, horses, each, with, the, geometry, of, a, fault, bend, fold, of, small, displacement, the, final, result, is, typically, a, lozenge, shaped, duplex, most, duplexes, have, only, small, displacements, on, the, bounding, faults, between, the, horses, which, dip, away, from, the, foreland, occasionally, the, displacement, on, the, individual, horses, is, more, significant, such, that, each, horse, lies, more, or, less, vertically, above, the, other, this, is, known, as, an, antiformal, stack, or, imbricate, stack, if, the, individual, displacements, are, still, greater, the, horses, have, a, foreland, dip, duplexing, is, a, very, efficient, mechanism, of, accommodating, the, shortening, of, the, crust, by, thickening, the, section, rather, than, by, folding, and, deformation, large, overthrust, faults, occur, in, areas, that, have, undergone, great, compressional, forces, these, conditions, exist, in, the, orogenic, belts, that, result, from, either, two, continental, tectonic, collisions, or, from, subduction, zone, accretion, the, resultant, compressional, forces, produce, mountain, ranges, the, himalayas, the, alps, and, the, appalachians, are, prominent, examples, of, compressional, orogenies, with, numerous, overthrust, faults, thrust, faults, occur, in, the, foreland, basin, marginal, to, orogenic, belts, here, compression, does, not, result, in, appreciable, mountain, building, which, is, mostly, accommodated, by, folding, and, stacking, of, thrusts, instead, thrust, faults, generally, cause, a, thickening, of, the, stratigraphic, section, when, thrusts, are, developed, in, orogens, formed, in, previously, rifted, margins, inversion, of, the, buried, paleo, rifts, can, induce, the, nucleation, of, thrust, ramps, foreland, basin, thrusts, also, usually, observe, the, ramp, flat, geometry, with, thrusts, propagating, within, units, at, very, low, angle, flats, at, 1, 5, degrees, and, then, moving, up, section, in, steeper, ramps, at, 5, 20, degrees, where, they, offset, stratigraphic, units, thrusts, have, also, been, detected, in, cratonic, settings, where, far, foreland, deformation, has, advanced, into, intracontinental, areas, thrusts, and, duplexes, are, also, found, in, accretionary, wedges, in, the, ocean, trench, margin, of, subduction, zones, where, oceanic, sediments, are, scraped, off, the, subducted, plate, and, accumulate, here, the, accretionary, wedge, must, thicken, by, up, to, 200, and, this, is, achieved, by, stacking, thrust, fault, upon, thrust, fault, in, a, melange, of, disrupted, rock, often, with, chaotic, folding, here, ramp, flat, geometries, are, not, usually, observed, because, the, compressional, force, is, at, a, steep, angle, to, the, sedimentary, layering, thrust, faults, were, unrecognised, until, the, work, of, arnold, escher, von, der, linth, albert, heim, and, marcel, alexandre, bertrand, in, the, alps, working, on, the, glarus, thrust, charles, lapworth, ben, peach, and, john, horne, working, on, parts, of, the, moine, thrust, in, the, scottish, highlands, alfred, elis, t, rnebohm, in, the, scandinavian, caledonides, and, r, g, mcconnell, in, the, canadian, rockies, the, realisation, that, older, strata, could, via, faulting, be, found, above, younger, strata, was, arrived, at, more, or, less, independently, by, geologists, in, all, these, areas, during, the, 1880s, geikie, in, 1884, coined, the, term, thrust, plane, to, describe, this, special, set, of, faults, he, wrote, by, a, system, of, reversed, faults, a, group, of, strata, is, made, to, cover, a, great, breadth, of, ground, and, actually, to, overlie, higher, members, of, the, same, series, the, most, extraordinary, dislocations, however, are, those, to, which, for, distinction, we, have, given, the, name, of, thrust, planes, they, are, strictly, reversed, faults, but, with, so, low, a, hade, that, the, rocks, on, their, upthrown, side, have, been, as, it, were, pushed, horizontally, forward
