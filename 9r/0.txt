science, is, a, systematic, discipline, that, builds, and, organises, knowledge, in, the, form, of, testable, hypotheses, and, predictions, about, the, world, modern, science, is, typically, divided, into, two, or, three, major, branches, the, natural, sciences, e, g, physics, chemistry, and, biology, which, study, the, physical, world, and, the, behavioural, sciences, e, g, economics, psychology, and, sociology, which, study, individuals, and, societies, the, formal, sciences, e, g, logic, mathematics, and, theoretical, computer, science, which, study, formal, systems, governed, by, axioms, and, rules, are, sometimes, described, as, being, sciences, as, well, however, they, are, often, regarded, as, a, separate, field, because, they, rely, on, deductive, reasoning, instead, of, the, scientific, method, or, empirical, evidence, as, their, main, methodology, applied, sciences, are, disciplines, that, use, scientific, knowledge, for, practical, purposes, such, as, engineering, and, medicine, the, history, of, science, spans, the, majority, of, the, historical, record, with, the, earliest, written, records, of, identifiable, predecessors, to, modern, science, dating, to, bronze, age, egypt, and, mesopotamia, from, around, 3000, to, 1200, bce, their, contributions, to, mathematics, astronomy, and, medicine, entered, and, shaped, the, greek, natural, philosophy, of, classical, antiquity, whereby, formal, attempts, were, made, to, provide, explanations, of, events, in, the, physical, world, based, on, natural, causes, while, further, advancements, including, the, introduction, of, the, hindu, arabic, numeral, system, were, made, during, the, golden, age, of, india, 12, scientific, research, deteriorated, in, these, regions, after, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, during, the, early, middle, ages, 400, to, 1000, ce, but, in, the, medieval, renaissances, carolingian, renaissance, ottonian, renaissance, and, the, renaissance, of, the, 12th, century, scholarship, flourished, again, some, greek, manuscripts, lost, in, western, europe, were, preserved, and, expanded, upon, in, the, middle, east, during, the, islamic, golden, age, along, with, the, later, efforts, of, byzantine, greek, scholars, who, brought, greek, manuscripts, from, the, dying, byzantine, empire, to, western, europe, at, the, start, of, the, renaissance, the, recovery, and, assimilation, of, greek, works, and, islamic, inquiries, into, western, europe, from, the, 10th, to, 13th, century, revived, natural, philosophy, which, was, later, transformed, by, the, scientific, revolution, that, began, in, the, 16th, century, as, new, ideas, and, discoveries, departed, from, previous, greek, conceptions, and, traditions, the, scientific, method, soon, played, a, greater, role, in, knowledge, creation, and, it, was, not, until, the, 19th, century, that, many, of, the, institutional, and, professional, features, of, science, began, to, take, shape, along, with, the, changing, of, natural, philosophy, to, natural, science, new, knowledge, in, science, is, advanced, by, research, from, scientists, who, are, motivated, by, curiosity, about, the, world, and, a, desire, to, solve, problems, contemporary, scientific, research, is, highly, collaborative, and, is, usually, done, by, teams, in, academic, and, research, institutions, government, agencies, and, companies, the, practical, impact, of, their, work, has, led, to, the, emergence, of, science, policies, that, seek, to, influence, the, scientific, enterprise, by, prioritising, the, ethical, and, moral, development, of, commercial, products, armaments, health, care, public, infrastructure, and, environmental, protection, the, word, science, has, been, used, in, middle, english, since, the, 14th, century, in, the, sense, of, the, state, of, knowing, the, word, was, borrowed, from, the, anglo, norman, language, as, the, suffix, cience, which, was, borrowed, from, the, latin, word, scientia, meaning, knowledge, awareness, understanding, it, is, a, noun, derivative, of, the, latin, sciens, meaning, knowing, and, undisputedly, derived, from, the, latin, sci, the, present, participle, sc, re, meaning, to, know, there, are, many, hypotheses, for, science, s, ultimate, word, origin, according, to, michiel, de, vaan, dutch, linguist, and, indo, europeanist, sci, may, have, its, origin, in, the, proto, italic, language, as, skije, or, skijo, meaning, to, know, which, may, originate, from, proto, indo, european, language, as, skh, 1, ie, skh, 1, io, meaning, to, incise, the, lexikon, der, indogermanischen, verben, proposed, sci, is, a, back, formation, of, nesc, re, meaning, to, not, know, be, unfamiliar, with, which, may, derive, from, proto, indo, european, sekh, in, latin, sec, re, or, skh, 2, from, s, eh2, i, meaning, to, cut, in, the, past, science, was, a, synonym, for, knowledge, or, study, in, keeping, with, its, latin, origin, a, person, who, conducted, scientific, research, was, called, a, natural, philosopher, or, man, of, science, in, 1834, william, whewell, introduced, the, term, scientist, in, a, review, of, mary, somerville, s, book, on, the, connexion, of, the, physical, sciences, crediting, it, to, some, ingenious, gentleman, possibly, himself, science, has, no, single, origin, rather, systematic, methods, emerged, gradually, over, the, course, of, tens, of, thousands, of, years, taking, different, forms, around, the, world, and, few, details, are, known, about, the, very, earliest, developments, women, likely, played, a, central, role, in, prehistoric, science, as, did, religious, rituals, some, scholars, use, the, term, protoscience, to, label, activities, in, the, past, that, resemble, modern, science, in, some, but, not, all, features, however, this, label, has, also, been, criticised, as, denigrating, or, too, suggestive, of, presentism, thinking, about, those, activities, only, in, relation, to, modern, categories, direct, evidence, for, scientific, processes, becomes, clearer, with, the, advent, of, writing, systems, in, early, civilisations, like, ancient, egypt, and, mesopotamia, creating, the, earliest, written, records, in, the, history, of, science, in, around, 3000, to, 1200, bce, 12, 15, although, the, words, and, concepts, of, science, and, nature, were, not, part, of, the, conceptual, landscape, at, the, time, the, ancient, egyptians, and, mesopotamians, made, contributions, that, would, later, find, a, place, in, greek, and, medieval, science, mathematics, astronomy, and, medicine, 12, from, the, 3rd, millennium, bce, the, ancient, egyptians, developed, a, decimal, numbering, system, solved, practical, problems, using, geometry, and, developed, a, calendar, their, healing, therapies, involved, drug, treatments, and, the, supernatural, such, as, prayers, incantations, and, rituals, 9, the, ancient, mesopotamians, used, knowledge, about, the, properties, of, various, natural, chemicals, for, manufacturing, pottery, faience, glass, soap, metals, lime, plaster, and, waterproofing, they, studied, animal, physiology, anatomy, behaviour, and, astrology, for, divinatory, purposes, the, mesopotamians, had, an, intense, interest, in, medicine, and, the, earliest, medical, prescriptions, appeared, in, sumerian, during, the, third, dynasty, of, ur, they, seem, to, have, studied, scientific, subjects, which, had, practical, or, religious, applications, and, had, little, interest, in, satisfying, curiosity, in, classical, antiquity, there, is, no, real, ancient, analogue, of, a, modern, scientist, instead, well, educated, usually, upper, class, and, almost, universally, male, individuals, performed, various, investigations, into, nature, whenever, they, could, afford, the, time, before, the, invention, or, discovery, of, the, concept, of, phusis, or, nature, by, the, pre, socratic, philosophers, the, same, words, tend, to, be, used, to, describe, the, natural, way, in, which, a, plant, grows, and, the, way, in, which, for, example, one, tribe, worships, a, particular, god, for, this, reason, it, is, claimed, that, these, men, were, the, first, philosophers, in, the, strict, sense, and, the, first, to, clearly, distinguish, nature, and, convention, the, early, greek, philosophers, of, the, milesian, school, which, was, founded, by, thales, of, miletus, and, later, continued, by, his, successors, anaximander, and, anaximenes, were, the, first, to, attempt, to, explain, natural, phenomena, without, relying, on, the, supernatural, the, pythagoreans, developed, a, complex, number, philosophy, 467, 68, and, contributed, significantly, to, the, development, of, mathematical, science, 465, the, theory, of, atoms, was, developed, by, the, greek, philosopher, leucippus, and, his, student, democritus, later, epicurus, would, develop, a, full, natural, cosmology, based, on, atomism, and, would, adopt, a, canon, ruler, standard, which, established, physical, criteria, or, standards, of, scientific, truth, the, greek, doctor, hippocrates, established, the, tradition, of, systematic, medical, science, and, is, known, as, the, father, of, medicine, a, turning, point, in, the, history, of, early, philosophical, science, was, socrates, example, of, applying, philosophy, to, the, study, of, human, matters, including, human, nature, the, nature, of, political, communities, and, human, knowledge, itself, the, socratic, method, as, documented, by, plato, s, dialogues, is, a, dialectic, method, of, hypothesis, elimination, better, hypotheses, are, found, by, steadily, identifying, and, eliminating, those, that, lead, to, contradictions, the, socratic, method, searches, for, general, commonly, held, truths, that, shape, beliefs, and, scrutinises, them, for, consistency, socrates, criticised, the, older, type, of, study, of, physics, as, too, purely, speculative, and, lacking, in, self, criticism, aristotle, in, the, 4th, century, bce, created, a, systematic, program, of, teleological, philosophy, in, the, 3rd, century, bce, greek, astronomer, aristarchus, of, samos, was, the, first, to, propose, a, heliocentric, model, of, the, universe, with, the, sun, at, the, centre, and, all, the, planets, orbiting, it, aristarchus, s, model, was, widely, rejected, because, it, was, believed, to, violate, the, laws, of, physics, while, ptolemy, s, almagest, which, contains, a, geocentric, description, of, the, solar, system, was, accepted, through, the, early, renaissance, instead, the, inventor, and, mathematician, archimedes, of, syracuse, made, major, contributions, to, the, beginnings, of, calculus, pliny, the, elder, was, a, roman, writer, and, polymath, who, wrote, the, seminal, encyclopaedia, natural, history, positional, notation, for, representing, numbers, likely, emerged, between, the, 3rd, and, 5th, centuries, ce, along, indian, trade, routes, this, numeral, system, made, efficient, arithmetic, operations, more, accessible, and, would, eventually, become, standard, for, mathematics, worldwide, due, to, the, collapse, of, the, western, roman, empire, the, 5th, century, saw, an, intellectual, decline, and, knowledge, of, greek, conceptions, of, the, world, deteriorated, in, western, europe, 194, during, the, period, latin, encyclopaedists, such, as, isidore, of, seville, preserved, the, majority, of, general, ancient, knowledge, in, contrast, because, the, byzantine, empire, resisted, attacks, from, invaders, they, were, able, to, preserve, and, improve, prior, learning, 159, john, philoponus, a, byzantine, scholar, in, the, 500s, started, to, question, aristotle, s, teaching, of, physics, introducing, the, theory, of, impetus, 307, 311, 363, 402, his, criticism, served, as, an, inspiration, to, medieval, scholars, and, galileo, galilei, who, extensively, cited, his, works, ten, centuries, later, 307, 308, during, late, antiquity, and, the, early, middle, ages, natural, phenomena, were, mainly, examined, via, the, aristotelian, approach, the, approach, includes, aristotle, s, four, causes, material, formal, moving, and, final, cause, many, greek, classical, texts, were, preserved, by, the, byzantine, empire, and, arabic, translations, were, done, by, groups, such, as, the, nestorians, and, the, monophysites, under, the, caliphate, these, arabic, translations, were, later, improved, and, developed, by, arabic, scientists, by, the, 6th, and, 7th, centuries, the, neighbouring, sassanid, empire, established, the, medical, academy, of, gondeshapur, which, is, considered, by, greek, syriac, and, persian, physicians, as, the, most, important, medical, center, of, the, ancient, world, the, house, of, wisdom, was, established, in, abbasid, era, baghdad, iraq, where, the, islamic, study, of, aristotelianism, flourished, until, the, mongol, invasions, in, the, 13th, century, ibn, al, haytham, better, known, as, alhazen, used, controlled, experiments, in, his, optical, study, avicenna, s, compilation, of, the, canon, of, medicine, a, medical, encyclopaedia, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, most, important, publications, in, medicine, and, was, used, until, the, 18th, century, by, the, eleventh, century, most, of, europe, had, become, christian, 204, and, in, 1088, the, university, of, bologna, emerged, as, the, first, university, in, europe, as, such, demand, for, latin, translation, of, ancient, and, scientific, texts, grew, 204, a, major, contributor, to, the, renaissance, of, the, 12th, century, renaissance, scholasticism, in, western, europe, flourished, with, experiments, done, by, observing, describing, and, classifying, subjects, in, nature, in, the, 13th, century, medical, teachers, and, students, at, bologna, began, opening, human, bodies, leading, to, the, first, anatomy, textbook, based, on, human, dissection, by, mondino, de, luzzi, new, developments, in, optics, played, a, role, in, the, inception, of, the, renaissance, both, by, challenging, long, held, metaphysical, ideas, on, perception, as, well, as, by, contributing, to, the, improvement, and, development, of, technology, such, as, the, camera, obscura, and, the, telescope, at, the, start, of, the, renaissance, roger, bacon, vitello, and, john, peckham, each, built, up, a, scholastic, ontology, upon, a, causal, chain, beginning, with, sensation, perception, and, finally, apperception, of, the, individual, and, universal, forms, of, aristotle, book, i, a, model, of, vision, later, known, as, perspectivism, was, exploited, and, studied, by, the, artists, of, the, renaissance, this, theory, uses, only, three, of, aristotle, s, four, causes, formal, material, and, final, in, the, sixteenth, century, nicolaus, copernicus, formulated, a, heliocentric, model, of, the, solar, system, stating, that, the, planets, revolve, around, the, sun, instead, of, the, geocentric, model, where, the, planets, and, the, sun, revolve, around, the, earth, this, was, based, on, a, theorem, that, the, orbital, periods, of, the, planets, are, longer, as, their, orbs, are, farther, from, the, centre, of, motion, which, he, found, not, to, agree, with, ptolemy, s, model, johannes, kepler, and, others, challenged, the, notion, that, the, only, function, of, the, eye, is, perception, and, shifted, the, main, focus, in, optics, from, the, eye, to, the, propagation, of, light, kepler, is, best, known, however, for, improving, copernicus, heliocentric, model, through, the, discovery, of, kepler, s, laws, of, planetary, motion, kepler, did, not, reject, aristotelian, metaphysics, and, described, his, work, as, a, search, for, the, harmony, of, the, spheres, galileo, had, made, significant, contributions, to, astronomy, physics, and, engineering, however, he, became, persecuted, after, pope, urban, viii, sentenced, him, for, writing, about, the, heliocentric, model, the, printing, press, was, widely, used, to, publish, scholarly, arguments, including, some, that, disagreed, widely, with, contemporary, ideas, of, nature, francis, bacon, and, ren, descartes, published, philosophical, arguments, in, favour, of, a, new, type, of, non, aristotelian, science, bacon, emphasised, the, importance, of, experiment, over, contemplation, questioned, the, aristotelian, concepts, of, formal, and, final, cause, promoted, the, idea, that, science, should, study, the, laws, of, nature, and, the, improvement, of, all, human, life, descartes, emphasised, individual, thought, and, argued, that, mathematics, rather, than, geometry, should, be, used, to, study, nature, at, the, start, of, the, age, of, enlightenment, isaac, newton, formed, the, foundation, of, classical, mechanics, by, his, philosophi, naturalis, principia, mathematica, greatly, influencing, future, physicists, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, incorporated, terms, from, aristotelian, physics, now, used, in, a, new, non, teleological, way, this, implied, a, shift, in, the, view, of, objects, objects, were, now, considered, as, having, no, innate, goals, leibniz, assumed, that, different, types, of, things, all, work, according, to, the, same, general, laws, of, nature, with, no, special, formal, or, final, causes, during, this, time, the, declared, purpose, and, value, of, science, became, producing, wealth, and, inventions, that, would, improve, human, lives, in, the, materialistic, sense, of, having, more, food, clothing, and, other, things, in, bacon, s, words, the, real, and, legitimate, goal, of, sciences, is, the, endowment, of, human, life, with, new, inventions, and, riches, and, he, discouraged, scientists, from, pursuing, intangible, philosophical, or, spiritual, ideas, which, he, believed, contributed, little, to, human, happiness, beyond, the, fume, of, subtle, sublime, or, pleasing, science, during, the, enlightenment, was, dominated, by, scientific, societies, and, academies, which, had, largely, replaced, universities, as, centres, of, scientific, research, and, development, societies, and, academies, were, the, backbones, of, the, maturation, of, the, scientific, profession, another, important, development, was, the, popularisation, of, science, among, an, increasingly, literate, population, enlightenment, philosophers, turned, to, a, few, of, their, scientific, predecessors, galileo, kepler, boyle, and, newton, principally, as, the, guides, to, every, physical, and, social, field, of, the, day, the, 18th, century, saw, significant, advancements, in, the, practice, of, medicine, and, physics, the, development, of, biological, taxonomy, by, carl, linnaeus, a, new, understanding, of, magnetism, and, electricity, and, the, maturation, of, chemistry, as, a, discipline, ideas, on, human, nature, society, and, economics, evolved, during, the, enlightenment, hume, and, other, scottish, enlightenment, thinkers, developed, a, treatise, of, human, nature, which, was, expressed, historically, in, works, by, authors, including, james, burnett, adam, ferguson, john, millar, and, william, robertson, all, of, whom, merged, a, scientific, study, of, how, humans, behaved, in, ancient, and, primitive, cultures, with, a, strong, awareness, of, the, determining, forces, of, modernity, modern, sociology, largely, originated, from, this, movement, in, 1776, adam, smith, published, the, wealth, of, nations, which, is, often, considered, the, first, work, on, modern, economics, during, the, nineteenth, century, many, distinguishing, characteristics, of, contemporary, modern, science, began, to, take, shape, these, included, the, transformation, of, the, life, and, physical, sciences, the, frequent, use, of, precision, instruments, the, emergence, of, terms, such, as, biologist, physicist, and, scientist, an, increased, professionalisation, of, those, studying, nature, scientists, gaining, cultural, authority, over, many, dimensions, of, society, the, industrialisation, of, numerous, countries, the, thriving, of, popular, science, writings, and, the, emergence, of, science, journals, during, the, late, 19th, century, psychology, emerged, as, a, separate, discipline, from, philosophy, when, wilhelm, wundt, founded, the, first, laboratory, for, psychological, research, in, 1879, during, the, mid, 19th, century, charles, darwin, and, alfred, russel, wallace, independently, proposed, the, theory, of, evolution, by, natural, selection, in, 1858, which, explained, how, different, plants, and, animals, originated, and, evolved, their, theory, was, set, out, in, detail, in, darwin, s, book, on, the, origin, of, species, published, in, 1859, separately, gregor, mendel, presented, his, paper, experiments, on, plant, hybridization, in, 1865, which, outlined, the, principles, of, biological, inheritance, serving, as, the, basis, for, modern, genetics, early, in, the, 19th, century, john, dalton, suggested, the, modern, atomic, theory, based, on, democritus, s, original, idea, of, indivisible, particles, called, atoms, the, laws, of, conservation, of, energy, conservation, of, momentum, and, conservation, of, mass, suggested, a, highly, stable, universe, where, there, could, be, little, loss, of, resources, however, with, the, advent, of, the, steam, engine, and, the, industrial, revolution, there, was, an, increased, understanding, that, not, all, forms, of, energy, have, the, same, energy, qualities, the, ease, of, conversion, to, useful, work, or, to, another, form, of, energy, this, realisation, led, to, the, development, of, the, laws, of, thermodynamics, in, which, the, free, energy, of, the, universe, is, seen, as, constantly, declining, the, entropy, of, a, closed, universe, increases, over, time, the, electromagnetic, theory, was, established, in, the, 19th, century, by, the, works, of, hans, christian, rsted, andr, marie, amp, re, michael, faraday, james, clerk, maxwell, oliver, heaviside, and, heinrich, hertz, the, new, theory, raised, questions, that, could, not, easily, be, answered, using, newton, s, framework, the, discovery, of, x, rays, inspired, the, discovery, of, radioactivity, by, henri, becquerel, and, marie, curie, in, 1896, marie, curie, then, became, the, first, person, to, win, two, nobel, prizes, in, the, next, year, came, the, discovery, of, the, first, subatomic, particle, the, electron, in, the, first, half, of, the, century, the, development, of, antibiotics, and, artificial, fertilisers, improved, human, living, standards, globally, harmful, environmental, issues, such, as, ozone, depletion, ocean, acidification, eutrophication, and, climate, change, came, to, the, public, s, attention, and, caused, the, onset, of, environmental, studies, during, this, period, scientific, experimentation, became, increasingly, larger, in, scale, and, funding, the, extensive, technological, innovation, stimulated, by, world, war, i, world, war, ii, and, the, cold, war, led, to, competitions, between, global, powers, such, as, the, space, race, and, nuclear, arms, race, substantial, international, collaborations, were, also, made, despite, armed, conflicts, in, the, late, 20th, century, active, recruitment, of, women, and, elimination, of, sex, discrimination, greatly, increased, the, number, of, women, scientists, but, large, gender, disparities, remained, in, some, fields, the, discovery, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, in, 1964, led, to, a, rejection, of, the, steady, state, model, of, the, universe, in, favour, of, the, big, bang, theory, of, georges, lema, tre, the, century, saw, fundamental, changes, within, science, disciplines, evolution, became, a, unified, theory, in, the, early, 20th, century, when, the, modern, synthesis, reconciled, darwinian, evolution, with, classical, genetics, albert, einstein, s, theory, of, relativity, and, the, development, of, quantum, mechanics, complement, classical, mechanics, to, describe, physics, in, extreme, length, time, and, gravity, widespread, use, of, integrated, circuits, in, the, last, quarter, of, the, 20th, century, combined, with, communications, satellites, led, to, a, revolution, in, information, technology, and, the, rise, of, the, global, internet, and, mobile, computing, including, smartphones, the, need, for, mass, systematisation, of, long, intertwined, causal, chains, and, large, amounts, of, data, led, to, the, rise, of, the, fields, of, systems, theory, and, computer, assisted, scientific, modelling, the, human, genome, project, was, completed, in, 2003, by, identifying, and, mapping, all, of, the, genes, of, the, human, genome, the, first, induced, pluripotent, human, stem, cells, were, made, in, 2006, allowing, adult, cells, to, be, transformed, into, stem, cells, and, turn, into, any, cell, type, found, in, the, body, with, the, affirmation, of, the, higgs, boson, discovery, in, 2013, the, last, particle, predicted, by, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, was, found, in, 2015, gravitational, waves, predicted, by, general, relativity, a, century, before, were, first, observed, in, 2019, the, international, collaboration, event, horizon, telescope, presented, the, first, direct, image, of, a, black, hole, s, accretion, disc, modern, science, is, commonly, divided, into, three, major, branches, natural, science, social, science, and, formal, science, each, of, these, branches, comprises, various, specialised, yet, overlapping, scientific, disciplines, that, often, possess, their, own, nomenclature, and, expertise, both, natural, and, social, sciences, are, empirical, sciences, as, their, knowledge, is, based, on, empirical, observations, and, is, capable, of, being, tested, for, its, validity, by, other, researchers, working, under, the, same, conditions, natural, science, is, the, study, of, the, physical, world, it, can, be, divided, into, two, main, branches, life, science, and, physical, science, these, two, branches, may, be, further, divided, into, more, specialised, disciplines, for, example, physical, science, can, be, subdivided, into, physics, chemistry, astronomy, and, earth, science, modern, natural, science, is, the, successor, to, the, natural, philosophy, that, began, in, ancient, greece, galileo, descartes, bacon, and, newton, debated, the, benefits, of, using, approaches, that, were, more, mathematical, and, more, experimental, in, a, methodical, way, still, philosophical, perspectives, conjectures, and, presuppositions, often, overlooked, remain, necessary, in, natural, science, systematic, data, collection, including, discovery, science, succeeded, natural, history, which, emerged, in, the, 16th, century, by, describing, and, classifying, plants, animals, minerals, and, other, biotic, beings, today, natural, history, suggests, observational, descriptions, aimed, at, popular, audiences, social, science, is, the, study, of, human, behaviour, and, the, functioning, of, societies, it, has, many, disciplines, that, include, but, are, not, limited, to, anthropology, economics, history, human, geography, political, science, psychology, and, sociology, in, the, social, sciences, there, are, many, competing, theoretical, perspectives, many, of, which, are, extended, through, competing, research, programs, such, as, the, functionalists, conflict, theorists, and, interactionists, in, sociology, due, to, the, limitations, of, conducting, controlled, experiments, involving, large, groups, of, individuals, or, complex, situations, social, scientists, may, adopt, other, research, methods, such, as, the, historical, method, case, studies, and, cross, cultural, studies, moreover, if, quantitative, information, is, available, social, scientists, may, rely, on, statistical, approaches, to, better, understand, social, relationships, and, processes, formal, science, is, an, area, of, study, that, generates, knowledge, using, formal, systems, a, formal, system, is, an, abstract, structure, used, for, inferring, theorems, from, axioms, according, to, a, set, of, rules, it, includes, mathematics, systems, theory, and, theoretical, computer, science, the, formal, sciences, share, similarities, with, the, other, two, branches, by, relying, on, objective, careful, and, systematic, study, of, an, area, of, knowledge, they, are, however, different, from, the, empirical, sciences, as, they, rely, exclusively, on, deductive, reasoning, without, the, need, for, empirical, evidence, to, verify, their, abstract, concepts, the, formal, sciences, are, therefore, a, priori, disciplines, and, because, of, this, there, is, disagreement, on, whether, they, constitute, a, science, nevertheless, the, formal, sciences, play, an, important, role, in, the, empirical, sciences, calculus, for, example, was, initially, invented, to, understand, motion, in, physics, natural, and, social, sciences, that, rely, heavily, on, mathematical, applications, include, mathematical, physics, chemistry, biology, finance, and, economics, applied, science, is, the, use, of, the, scientific, method, and, knowledge, to, attain, practical, goals, and, includes, a, broad, range, of, disciplines, such, as, engineering, and, medicine, engineering, is, the, use, of, scientific, principles, to, invent, design, and, build, machines, structures, and, technologies, science, may, contribute, to, the, development, of, new, technologies, medicine, is, the, practice, of, caring, for, patients, by, maintaining, and, restoring, health, through, the, prevention, diagnosis, and, treatment, of, injury, or, disease, the, applied, sciences, are, often, contrasted, with, the, basic, sciences, which, are, focused, on, advancing, scientific, theories, and, laws, that, explain, and, predict, events, in, the, natural, world, computational, science, applies, computing, power, to, simulate, real, world, situations, enabling, a, better, understanding, of, scientific, problems, than, formal, mathematics, alone, can, achieve, the, use, of, machine, learning, and, artificial, intelligence, is, becoming, a, central, feature, of, computational, contributions, to, science, for, example, in, agent, based, computational, economics, random, forests, topic, modeling, and, various, forms, of, prediction, however, machines, alone, rarely, advance, knowledge, as, they, require, human, guidance, and, capacity, to, reason, and, they, can, introduce, bias, against, certain, social, groups, or, sometimes, underperform, against, humans, interdisciplinary, science, involves, the, combination, of, two, or, more, disciplines, into, one, such, as, bioinformatics, a, combination, of, biology, and, computer, science, or, cognitive, sciences, the, concept, has, existed, since, the, ancient, greek, period, and, it, became, popular, again, in, the, 20th, century, scientific, research, can, be, labelled, as, either, basic, or, applied, research, basic, research, is, the, search, for, knowledge, and, applied, research, is, the, search, for, solutions, to, practical, problems, using, this, knowledge, most, understanding, comes, from, basic, research, though, sometimes, applied, research, targets, specific, practical, problems, this, leads, to, technological, advances, that, were, not, previously, imaginable, scientific, research, involves, using, the, scientific, method, which, seeks, to, objectively, explain, the, events, of, nature, in, a, reproducible, way, scientists, usually, take, for, granted, a, set, of, basic, assumptions, that, are, needed, to, justify, the, scientific, method, there, is, an, objective, reality, shared, by, all, rational, observers, this, objective, reality, is, governed, by, natural, laws, these, laws, were, discovered, by, means, of, systematic, observation, and, experimentation, mathematics, is, essential, in, the, formation, of, hypotheses, theories, and, laws, because, it, is, used, extensively, in, quantitative, modelling, observing, and, collecting, measurements, statistics, is, used, to, summarise, and, analyse, data, which, allows, scientists, to, assess, the, reliability, of, experimental, results, in, the, scientific, method, an, explanatory, thought, experiment, or, hypothesis, is, put, forward, as, an, explanation, using, parsimony, principles, and, is, expected, to, seek, consilience, fitting, with, other, accepted, facts, related, to, an, observation, or, scientific, question, this, tentative, explanation, is, used, to, make, falsifiable, predictions, which, are, typically, posted, before, being, tested, by, experimentation, disproof, of, a, prediction, is, evidence, of, progress, 4, 5, experimentation, is, especially, important, in, science, to, help, establish, causal, relationships, to, avoid, the, correlation, fallacy, though, in, some, sciences, such, as, astronomy, or, geology, a, predicted, observation, might, be, more, appropriate, when, a, hypothesis, proves, unsatisfactory, it, is, modified, or, discarded, if, the, hypothesis, survives, testing, it, may, become, adopted, into, the, framework, of, a, scientific, theory, a, validly, reasoned, self, consistent, model, or, framework, for, describing, the, behaviour, of, certain, natural, events, a, theory, typically, describes, the, behaviour, of, much, broader, sets, of, observations, than, a, hypothesis, commonly, a, large, number, of, hypotheses, can, be, logically, bound, together, by, a, single, theory, thus, a, theory, is, a, hypothesis, explaining, various, other, hypotheses, in, that, vein, theories, are, formulated, according, to, most, of, the, same, scientific, principles, as, hypotheses, scientists, may, generate, a, model, an, attempt, to, describe, or, depict, an, observation, in, terms, of, a, logical, physical, or, mathematical, representation, and, to, generate, new, hypotheses, that, can, be, tested, by, experimentation, while, performing, experiments, to, test, hypotheses, scientists, may, have, a, preference, for, one, outcome, over, another, eliminating, the, bias, can, be, achieved, through, transparency, careful, experimental, design, and, a, thorough, peer, review, process, of, the, experimental, results, and, conclusions, after, the, results, of, an, experiment, are, announced, or, published, it, is, normal, practice, for, independent, researchers, to, double, check, how, the, research, was, performed, and, to, follow, up, by, performing, similar, experiments, to, determine, how, dependable, the, results, might, be, taken, in, its, entirety, the, scientific, method, allows, for, highly, creative, problem, solving, while, minimising, the, effects, of, subjective, and, confirmation, bias, intersubjective, verifiability, the, ability, to, reach, a, consensus, and, reproduce, results, is, fundamental, to, the, creation, of, all, scientific, knowledge, scientific, research, is, published, in, a, range, of, literature, scientific, journals, communicate, and, document, the, results, of, research, carried, out, in, universities, and, various, other, research, institutions, serving, as, an, archival, record, of, science, the, first, scientific, journals, journal, des, s, avans, followed, by, philosophical, transactions, began, publication, in, 1665, since, that, time, the, total, number, of, active, periodicals, has, steadily, increased, in, 1981, one, estimate, for, the, number, of, scientific, and, technical, journals, in, publication, was, 11, 500, most, scientific, journals, cover, a, single, scientific, field, and, publish, the, research, within, that, field, the, research, is, normally, expressed, in, the, form, of, a, scientific, paper, science, has, become, so, pervasive, in, modern, societies, that, it, is, considered, necessary, to, communicate, the, achievements, news, and, ambitions, of, scientists, to, a, wider, population, the, replication, crisis, is, an, ongoing, methodological, crisis, that, affects, parts, of, the, social, and, life, sciences, in, subsequent, investigations, the, results, of, many, scientific, studies, have, been, proven, to, be, unrepeatable, the, crisis, has, long, standing, roots, the, phrase, was, coined, in, the, early, 2010s, as, part, of, a, growing, awareness, of, the, problem, the, replication, crisis, represents, an, important, body, of, research, in, metascience, which, aims, to, improve, the, quality, of, all, scientific, research, while, reducing, waste, an, area, of, study, or, speculation, that, masquerades, as, science, in, an, attempt, to, claim, legitimacy, that, it, would, not, otherwise, be, able, to, achieve, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, pseudoscience, fringe, science, or, junk, science, physicist, richard, feynman, coined, the, term, cargo, cult, science, for, cases, in, which, researchers, believe, and, at, a, glance, look, like, they, are, doing, science, but, lack, the, honesty, to, allow, their, results, to, be, rigorously, evaluated, various, types, of, commercial, advertising, ranging, from, hype, to, fraud, may, fall, into, these, categories, science, has, been, described, as, the, most, important, tool, for, separating, valid, claims, from, invalid, ones, there, can, also, be, an, element, of, political, or, ideological, bias, on, all, sides, of, scientific, debates, sometimes, research, may, be, characterised, as, bad, science, research, that, may, be, well, intended, but, is, incorrect, obsolete, incomplete, or, over, simplified, expositions, of, scientific, ideas, the, term, scientific, misconduct, refers, to, situations, such, as, where, researchers, have, intentionally, misrepresented, their, published, data, or, have, purposely, given, credit, for, a, discovery, to, the, wrong, person, there, are, different, schools, of, thought, in, the, philosophy, of, science, the, most, popular, position, is, empiricism, which, holds, that, knowledge, is, created, by, a, process, involving, observation, scientific, theories, generalise, observations, empiricism, generally, encompasses, inductivism, a, position, that, explains, how, general, theories, can, be, made, from, the, finite, amount, of, empirical, evidence, available, many, versions, of, empiricism, exist, with, the, predominant, ones, being, bayesianism, and, the, hypothetico, deductive, method, empiricism, has, stood, in, contrast, to, rationalism, the, position, originally, associated, with, descartes, which, holds, that, knowledge, is, created, by, the, human, intellect, not, by, observation, critical, rationalism, is, a, contrasting, 20th, century, approach, to, science, first, defined, by, austrian, british, philosopher, karl, popper, popper, rejected, the, way, that, empiricism, describes, the, connection, between, theory, and, observation, he, claimed, that, theories, are, not, generated, by, observation, but, that, observation, is, made, in, the, light, of, theories, and, that, the, only, way, theory, a, can, be, affected, by, observation, is, after, theory, a, were, to, conflict, with, observation, but, theory, b, were, to, survive, the, observation, popper, proposed, replacing, verifiability, with, falsifiability, as, the, landmark, of, scientific, theories, replacing, induction, with, falsification, as, the, empirical, method, popper, further, claimed, that, there, is, actually, only, one, universal, method, not, specific, to, science, the, negative, method, of, criticism, trial, and, error, covering, all, products, of, the, human, mind, including, science, mathematics, philosophy, and, art, another, approach, instrumentalism, emphasises, the, utility, of, theories, as, instruments, for, explaining, and, predicting, phenomena, it, views, scientific, theories, as, black, boxes, with, only, their, input, initial, conditions, and, output, predictions, being, relevant, consequences, theoretical, entities, and, logical, structure, are, claimed, to, be, things, that, should, be, ignored, close, to, instrumentalism, is, constructive, empiricism, according, to, which, the, main, criterion, for, the, success, of, a, scientific, theory, is, whether, what, it, says, about, observable, entities, is, true, thomas, kuhn, argued, that, the, process, of, observation, and, evaluation, takes, place, within, a, paradigm, a, logically, consistent, portrait, of, the, world, that, is, consistent, with, observations, made, from, its, framing, he, characterised, normal, science, as, the, process, of, observation, and, puzzle, solving, which, takes, place, within, a, paradigm, whereas, revolutionary, science, occurs, when, one, paradigm, overtakes, another, in, a, paradigm, shift, each, paradigm, has, its, own, distinct, questions, aims, and, interpretations, the, choice, between, paradigms, involves, setting, two, or, more, portraits, against, the, world, and, deciding, which, likeness, is, most, promising, a, paradigm, shift, occurs, when, a, significant, number, of, observational, anomalies, arise, in, the, old, paradigm, and, a, new, paradigm, makes, sense, of, them, that, is, the, choice, of, a, new, paradigm, is, based, on, observations, even, though, those, observations, are, made, against, the, background, of, the, old, paradigm, for, kuhn, acceptance, or, rejection, of, a, paradigm, is, a, social, process, as, much, as, a, logical, process, kuhn, s, position, however, is, not, one, of, relativism, finally, another, approach, often, cited, in, debates, of, scientific, scepticism, against, controversial, movements, like, creation, science, is, methodological, naturalism, naturalists, maintain, that, a, difference, should, be, made, between, natural, and, supernatural, and, science, should, be, restricted, to, natural, explanations, methodological, naturalism, maintains, that, science, requires, strict, adherence, to, empirical, study, and, independent, verification, the, scientific, community, is, a, network, of, interacting, scientists, who, conduct, scientific, research, the, community, consists, of, smaller, groups, working, in, scientific, fields, by, having, peer, review, through, discussion, and, debate, within, journals, and, conferences, scientists, maintain, the, quality, of, research, methodology, and, objectivity, when, interpreting, results, scientists, are, individuals, who, conduct, scientific, research, to, advance, knowledge, in, an, area, of, interest, in, modern, times, many, professional, scientists, are, trained, in, an, academic, setting, and, upon, completion, attain, an, academic, degree, with, the, highest, degree, being, a, doctorate, such, as, a, doctor, of, philosophy, or, phd, many, scientists, pursue, careers, in, various, sectors, of, the, economy, such, as, academia, industry, government, and, nonprofit, organisations, scientists, exhibit, a, strong, curiosity, about, reality, and, a, desire, to, apply, scientific, knowledge, for, the, benefit, of, health, nations, the, environment, or, industries, other, motivations, include, recognition, by, their, peers, and, prestige, in, modern, times, many, scientists, have, advanced, degrees, in, an, area, of, science, and, pursue, careers, in, various, sectors, of, the, economy, such, as, academia, industry, government, and, nonprofit, environments, science, has, historically, been, a, male, dominated, field, with, notable, exceptions, women, in, science, faced, considerable, discrimination, in, science, much, as, they, did, in, other, areas, of, male, dominated, societies, for, example, women, were, frequently, passed, over, for, job, opportunities, and, denied, credit, for, their, work, the, achievements, of, women, in, science, have, been, attributed, to, the, defiance, of, their, traditional, role, as, labourers, within, the, domestic, sphere, learned, societies, for, the, communication, and, promotion, of, scientific, thought, and, experimentation, have, existed, since, the, renaissance, many, scientists, belong, to, a, learned, society, that, promotes, their, respective, scientific, discipline, profession, or, group, of, related, disciplines, membership, may, either, be, open, to, all, require, possession, of, scientific, credentials, or, conferred, by, election, most, scientific, societies, are, nonprofit, organisations, and, many, are, professional, associations, their, activities, typically, include, holding, regular, conferences, for, the, presentation, and, discussion, of, new, research, results, and, publishing, or, sponsoring, academic, journals, in, their, discipline, some, societies, act, as, professional, bodies, regulating, the, activities, of, their, members, in, the, public, interest, or, the, collective, interest, of, the, membership, the, professionalisation, of, science, begun, in, the, 19th, century, was, partly, enabled, by, the, creation, of, national, distinguished, academies, of, sciences, such, as, the, italian, accademia, dei, lincei, in, 1603, the, british, royal, society, in, 1660, the, french, academy, of, sciences, in, 1666, the, american, national, academy, of, sciences, in, 1863, the, german, kaiser, wilhelm, society, in, 1911, and, the, chinese, academy, of, sciences, in, 1949, international, scientific, organisations, such, as, the, international, science, council, are, devoted, to, international, cooperation, for, science, advancement, science, awards, are, usually, given, to, individuals, or, organisations, that, have, made, significant, contributions, to, a, discipline, they, are, often, given, by, prestigious, institutions, thus, it, is, considered, a, great, honour, for, a, scientist, receiving, them, since, the, early, renaissance, scientists, have, often, been, awarded, medals, money, and, titles, the, nobel, prize, a, widely, regarded, prestigious, award, is, awarded, annually, to, those, who, have, achieved, scientific, advances, in, the, fields, of, medicine, physics, and, chemistry, scientific, research, is, often, funded, through, a, competitive, process, in, which, potential, research, projects, are, evaluated, and, only, the, most, promising, receive, funding, such, processes, which, are, run, by, government, corporations, or, foundations, allocate, scarce, funds, total, research, funding, in, most, developed, countries, is, between, 1, 5, and, 3, of, gdp, in, the, oecd, around, two, thirds, of, research, and, development, in, scientific, and, technical, fields, is, carried, out, by, industry, and, 20, and, 10, respectively, by, universities, and, government, the, government, funding, proportion, in, certain, fields, is, higher, and, it, dominates, research, in, social, science, and, the, humanities, in, less, developed, nations, the, government, provides, the, bulk, of, the, funds, for, their, basic, scientific, research, many, governments, have, dedicated, agencies, to, support, scientific, research, such, as, the, national, science, foundation, in, the, united, states, the, national, scientific, and, technical, research, council, in, argentina, commonwealth, scientific, and, industrial, research, organization, in, australia, national, centre, for, scientific, research, in, france, the, max, planck, society, in, germany, and, national, research, council, in, spain, in, commercial, research, and, development, all, but, the, most, research, orientated, corporations, focus, more, heavily, on, near, term, commercialisation, possibilities, than, research, driven, by, curiosity, science, policy, is, concerned, with, policies, that, affect, the, conduct, of, the, scientific, enterprise, including, research, funding, often, in, pursuance, of, other, national, policy, goals, such, as, technological, innovation, to, promote, commercial, product, development, weapons, development, health, care, and, environmental, monitoring, science, policy, sometimes, refers, to, the, act, of, applying, scientific, knowledge, and, consensus, to, the, development, of, public, policies, in, accordance, with, public, policy, being, concerned, about, the, well, being, of, its, citizens, science, policy, s, goal, is, to, consider, how, science, and, technology, can, best, serve, the, public, public, policy, can, directly, affect, the, funding, of, capital, equipment, and, intellectual, infrastructure, for, industrial, research, by, providing, tax, incentives, to, those, organisations, that, fund, research, science, education, for, the, general, public, is, embedded, in, the, school, curriculum, and, is, supplemented, by, online, pedagogical, content, for, example, youtube, and, khan, academy, museums, and, science, magazines, and, blogs, scientific, literacy, is, chiefly, concerned, with, an, understanding, of, the, scientific, method, units, and, methods, of, measurement, empiricism, a, basic, understanding, of, statistics, correlations, qualitative, versus, quantitative, observations, aggregate, statistics, and, a, basic, understanding, of, core, scientific, fields, such, as, physics, chemistry, biology, ecology, geology, and, computation, as, a, student, advances, into, higher, stages, of, formal, education, the, curriculum, becomes, more, in, depth, traditional, subjects, usually, included, in, the, curriculum, are, natural, and, formal, sciences, although, recent, movements, include, social, and, applied, science, as, well, the, mass, media, face, pressures, that, can, prevent, them, from, accurately, depicting, competing, scientific, claims, in, terms, of, their, credibility, within, the, scientific, community, as, a, whole, determining, how, much, weight, to, give, different, sides, in, a, scientific, debate, may, require, considerable, expertise, regarding, the, matter, few, journalists, have, real, scientific, knowledge, and, even, beat, reporters, who, are, knowledgeable, about, certain, scientific, issues, may, be, ignorant, about, other, scientific, issues, that, they, are, suddenly, asked, to, cover, science, magazines, such, as, new, scientist, science, vie, and, scientific, american, cater, to, the, needs, of, a, much, wider, readership, and, provide, a, non, technical, summary, of, popular, areas, of, research, including, notable, discoveries, and, advances, in, certain, fields, of, research, the, science, fiction, genre, primarily, speculative, fiction, can, transmit, the, ideas, and, methods, of, science, to, the, general, public, recent, efforts, to, intensify, or, develop, links, between, science, and, non, scientific, disciplines, such, as, literature, or, poetry, include, the, creative, writing, science, resource, developed, through, the, royal, literary, fund, while, the, scientific, method, is, broadly, accepted, in, the, scientific, community, some, fractions, of, society, reject, certain, scientific, positions, or, are, sceptical, about, science, examples, are, the, common, notion, that, covid, 19, is, not, a, major, health, threat, to, the, us, held, by, 39, of, americans, in, august, 2021, or, the, belief, that, climate, change, is, not, a, major, threat, to, the, us, also, held, by, 40, of, americans, in, late, 2019, and, early, 2020, psychologists, have, pointed, to, four, factors, driving, rejection, of, scientific, results, anti, science, attitudes, often, seem, to, be, caused, by, fear, of, rejection, in, social, groups, for, instance, climate, change, is, perceived, as, a, threat, by, only, 22, of, americans, on, the, right, side, of, the, political, spectrum, but, by, 85, on, the, left, that, is, if, someone, on, the, left, would, not, consider, climate, change, as, a, threat, this, person, may, face, contempt, and, be, rejected, in, that, social, group, in, fact, people, may, rather, deny, a, scientifically, accepted, fact, than, lose, or, jeopardise, their, social, status, attitudes, towards, science, are, often, determined, by, political, opinions, and, goals, government, business, and, advocacy, groups, have, been, known, to, use, legal, and, economic, pressure, to, influence, scientific, researchers, many, factors, can, act, as, facets, of, the, politicisation, of, science, such, as, anti, intellectualism, perceived, threats, to, religious, beliefs, and, fear, for, business, interests, politicization, of, science, is, usually, accomplished, when, scientific, information, is, presented, in, a, way, that, emphasises, the, uncertainty, associated, with, the, scientific, evidence, tactics, such, as, shifting, conversation, failing, to, acknowledge, facts, and, capitalising, on, doubt, of, scientific, consensus, have, been, used, to, gain, more, attention, for, views, that, have, been, undermined, by, scientific, evidence, examples, of, issues, that, have, involved, the, politicisation, of, science, include, the, global, warming, controversy, health, effects, of, pesticides, and, health, effects, of, tobacco
