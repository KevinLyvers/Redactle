the, law, of, conservation, of, energy, states, that, the, total, energy, of, an, isolated, system, remains, constant, it, is, said, to, be, conserved, over, time, in, the, case, of, a, closed, system, the, principle, says, that, the, total, amount, of, energy, within, the, system, can, only, be, changed, through, energy, entering, or, leaving, the, system, energy, can, neither, be, created, nor, destroyed, rather, it, can, only, be, transformed, or, transferred, from, one, form, to, another, for, instance, chemical, energy, is, converted, to, kinetic, energy, when, a, stick, of, dynamite, explodes, if, one, adds, up, all, forms, of, energy, that, were, released, in, the, explosion, such, as, the, kinetic, energy, and, potential, energy, of, the, pieces, as, well, as, heat, and, sound, one, will, get, the, exact, decrease, of, chemical, energy, in, the, combustion, of, the, dynamite, classically, conservation, of, energy, was, distinct, from, conservation, of, mass, however, special, relativity, shows, that, mass, is, related, to, energy, and, vice, versa, by, e, m, c, 2, displaystyle, e, mc, 2, the, equation, representing, mass, energy, equivalence, and, science, now, takes, the, view, that, mass, energy, as, a, whole, is, conserved, theoretically, this, implies, that, any, object, with, mass, can, itself, be, converted, to, pure, energy, and, vice, versa, however, this, is, believed, to, be, possible, only, under, the, most, extreme, of, physical, conditions, such, as, likely, existed, in, the, universe, very, shortly, after, the, big, bang, or, when, black, holes, emit, hawking, radiation, given, the, stationary, action, principle, conservation, of, energy, can, be, rigorously, proven, by, noether, s, theorem, as, a, consequence, of, continuous, time, translation, symmetry, that, is, from, the, fact, that, the, laws, of, physics, do, not, change, over, time, a, consequence, of, the, law, of, conservation, of, energy, is, that, a, perpetual, motion, machine, of, the, first, kind, cannot, exist, that, is, to, say, no, system, without, an, external, energy, supply, can, deliver, an, unlimited, amount, of, energy, to, its, surroundings, depending, on, the, definition, of, energy, conservation, of, energy, can, arguably, be, violated, by, general, relativity, on, the, cosmological, scale, ancient, philosophers, as, far, back, as, thales, of, miletus, c, 550, bce, had, inklings, of, the, conservation, of, some, underlying, substance, of, which, everything, is, made, however, there, is, no, particular, reason, to, identify, their, theories, with, what, we, know, today, as, mass, energy, for, example, thales, thought, it, was, water, empedocles, 490, 430, bce, wrote, that, in, his, universal, system, composed, of, four, roots, earth, air, water, fire, nothing, comes, to, be, or, perishes, instead, these, elements, suffer, continual, rearrangement, epicurus, c, 350, bce, on, the, other, hand, believed, everything, in, the, universe, to, be, composed, of, indivisible, units, of, matter, the, ancient, precursor, to, atoms, and, he, too, had, some, idea, of, the, necessity, of, conservation, stating, that, the, sum, total, of, things, was, always, such, as, it, is, now, and, such, it, will, ever, remain, in, 1605, the, flemish, scientist, simon, stevin, was, able, to, solve, a, number, of, problems, in, statics, based, on, the, principle, that, perpetual, motion, was, impossible, in, 1639, galileo, published, his, analysis, of, several, situations, including, the, celebrated, interrupted, pendulum, which, can, be, described, in, modern, language, as, conservatively, converting, potential, energy, to, kinetic, energy, and, back, again, essentially, he, pointed, out, that, the, height, a, moving, body, rises, is, equal, to, the, height, from, which, it, falls, and, used, this, observation, to, infer, the, idea, of, inertia, the, remarkable, aspect, of, this, observation, is, that, the, height, to, which, a, moving, body, ascends, on, a, frictionless, surface, does, not, depend, on, the, shape, of, the, surface, in, 1669, christiaan, huygens, published, his, laws, of, collision, among, the, quantities, he, listed, as, being, invariant, before, and, after, the, collision, of, bodies, were, both, the, sum, of, their, linear, momenta, as, well, as, the, sum, of, their, kinetic, energies, however, the, difference, between, elastic, and, inelastic, collision, was, not, understood, at, the, time, this, led, to, the, dispute, among, later, researchers, as, to, which, of, these, conserved, quantities, was, the, more, fundamental, in, his, horologium, oscillatorium, he, gave, a, much, clearer, statement, regarding, the, height, of, ascent, of, a, moving, body, and, connected, this, idea, with, the, impossibility, of, perpetual, motion, huygens, s, study, of, the, dynamics, of, pendulum, motion, was, based, on, a, single, principle, that, the, center, of, gravity, of, a, heavy, object, cannot, lift, itself, between, 1676, and, 1689, gottfried, leibniz, first, attempted, a, mathematical, formulation, of, the, kind, of, energy, that, is, associated, with, motion, kinetic, energy, using, huygens, s, work, on, collision, leibniz, noticed, that, in, many, mechanical, systems, of, several, masses, m, i, each, with, velocity, v, i, was, conserved, so, long, as, the, masses, did, not, interact, he, called, this, quantity, the, vis, viva, or, living, force, of, the, system, the, principle, represents, an, accurate, statement, of, the, approximate, conservation, of, kinetic, energy, in, situations, where, there, is, no, friction, many, physicists, at, that, time, including, isaac, newton, held, that, the, conservation, of, momentum, which, holds, even, in, systems, with, friction, as, defined, by, the, momentum, was, the, conserved, vis, viva, it, was, later, shown, that, both, quantities, are, conserved, simultaneously, given, the, proper, conditions, such, as, in, an, elastic, collision, in, 1687, isaac, newton, published, his, principia, which, set, out, his, laws, of, motion, it, was, organized, around, the, concept, of, force, and, momentum, however, the, researchers, were, quick, to, recognize, that, the, principles, set, out, in, the, book, while, fine, for, point, masses, were, not, sufficient, to, tackle, the, motions, of, rigid, and, fluid, bodies, some, other, principles, were, also, required, by, the, 1690s, leibniz, was, arguing, that, conservation, of, vis, viva, and, conservation, of, momentum, undermined, the, then, popular, philosophical, doctrine, of, interactionist, dualism, during, the, 19th, century, when, conservation, of, energy, was, better, understood, leibniz, s, basic, argument, would, gain, widespread, acceptance, some, modern, scholars, continue, to, champion, specifically, conservation, based, attacks, on, dualism, while, others, subsume, the, argument, into, a, more, general, argument, about, causal, closure, the, law, of, conservation, of, vis, viva, was, championed, by, the, father, and, son, duo, johann, and, daniel, bernoulli, the, former, enunciated, the, principle, of, virtual, work, as, used, in, statics, in, its, full, generality, in, 1715, while, the, latter, based, his, hydrodynamica, published, in, 1738, on, this, single, vis, viva, conservation, principle, daniel, s, study, of, loss, of, vis, viva, of, flowing, water, led, him, to, formulate, the, bernoulli, s, principle, which, asserts, the, loss, to, be, proportional, to, the, change, in, hydrodynamic, pressure, daniel, also, formulated, the, notion, of, work, and, efficiency, for, hydraulic, machines, and, he, gave, a, kinetic, theory, of, gases, and, linked, the, kinetic, energy, of, gas, molecules, with, the, temperature, of, the, gas, this, focus, on, the, vis, viva, by, the, continental, physicists, eventually, led, to, the, discovery, of, stationarity, principles, governing, mechanics, such, as, the, d, alembert, s, principle, lagrangian, and, hamiltonian, formulations, of, mechanics, milie, du, ch, telet, 1706, 1749, proposed, and, tested, the, hypothesis, of, the, conservation, of, total, energy, as, distinct, from, momentum, inspired, by, the, theories, of, gottfried, leibniz, she, repeated, and, publicized, an, experiment, originally, devised, by, willem, s, gravesande, in, 1722, in, which, balls, were, dropped, from, different, heights, into, a, sheet, of, soft, clay, each, ball, s, kinetic, energy, as, indicated, by, the, quantity, of, material, displaced, was, shown, to, be, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, velocity, the, deformation, of, the, clay, was, found, to, be, directly, proportional, to, the, height, from, which, the, balls, were, dropped, equal, to, the, initial, potential, energy, some, earlier, workers, including, newton, and, voltaire, had, believed, that, energy, was, not, distinct, from, momentum, and, therefore, proportional, to, velocity, according, to, this, understanding, the, deformation, of, the, clay, should, have, been, proportional, to, the, square, root, of, the, height, from, which, the, balls, were, dropped, in, classical, physics, the, correct, formula, is, e, k, 1, 2, m, v, 2, displaystyle, e, k, frac, 1, 2, mv, 2, where, e, k, displaystyle, e, k, is, the, kinetic, energy, of, an, object, m, displaystyle, m, its, mass, and, v, displaystyle, v, its, speed, on, this, basis, du, ch, telet, proposed, that, energy, must, always, have, the, same, dimensions, in, any, form, which, is, necessary, to, be, able, to, consider, it, in, different, forms, kinetic, potential, heat, engineers, such, as, john, smeaton, peter, ewart, carl, holtzmann, gustave, adolphe, hirn, and, marc, seguin, recognized, that, conservation, of, momentum, alone, was, not, adequate, for, practical, calculation, and, made, use, of, leibniz, s, principle, the, principle, was, also, championed, by, some, chemists, such, as, william, hyde, wollaston, academics, such, as, john, playfair, were, quick, to, point, out, that, kinetic, energy, is, clearly, not, conserved, this, is, obvious, to, a, modern, analysis, based, on, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, but, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, the, fate, of, the, lost, energy, was, still, unknown, gradually, it, came, to, be, suspected, that, the, heat, inevitably, generated, by, motion, under, friction, was, another, form, of, vis, viva, in, 1783, antoine, lavoisier, and, pierre, simon, laplace, reviewed, the, two, competing, theories, of, vis, viva, and, caloric, theory, count, rumford, s, 1798, observations, of, heat, generation, during, the, boring, of, cannons, added, more, weight, to, the, view, that, mechanical, motion, could, be, converted, into, heat, and, that, it, was, important, that, the, conversion, was, quantitative, and, could, be, predicted, allowing, for, a, universal, conversion, constant, between, kinetic, energy, and, heat, vis, viva, then, started, to, be, known, as, energy, after, the, term, was, first, used, in, that, sense, by, thomas, young, in, 1807, the, recalibration, of, vis, viva, to, which, can, be, understood, as, converting, kinetic, energy, to, work, was, largely, the, result, of, gaspard, gustave, coriolis, and, jean, victor, poncelet, over, the, period, 1819, 1839, the, former, called, the, quantity, quantit, de, travail, quantity, of, work, and, the, latter, travail, m, canique, mechanical, work, and, both, championed, its, use, in, engineering, calculations, in, the, paper, ber, die, natur, der, w, rme, german, on, the, nature, of, heat, warmth, published, in, the, zeitschrift, f, r, physik, in, 1837, karl, friedrich, mohr, gave, one, of, the, earliest, general, statements, of, the, doctrine, of, the, conservation, of, energy, besides, the, 54, known, chemical, elements, there, is, in, the, physical, world, one, agent, only, and, this, is, called, kraft, it, may, appear, according, to, circumstances, as, motion, chemical, affinity, cohesion, electricity, light, and, magnetism, and, from, any, one, of, these, forms, it, can, be, transformed, into, any, of, the, others, a, key, stage, in, the, development, of, the, modern, conservation, principle, was, the, demonstration, of, the, mechanical, equivalent, of, heat, the, caloric, theory, maintained, that, heat, could, neither, be, created, nor, destroyed, whereas, conservation, of, energy, entails, the, contrary, principle, that, heat, and, mechanical, work, are, interchangeable, in, the, middle, of, the, eighteenth, century, mikhail, lomonosov, a, russian, scientist, postulated, his, corpusculo, kinetic, theory, of, heat, which, rejected, the, idea, of, a, caloric, through, the, results, of, empirical, studies, lomonosov, came, to, the, conclusion, that, heat, was, not, transferred, through, the, particles, of, the, caloric, fluid, in, 1798, count, rumford, benjamin, thompson, performed, measurements, of, the, frictional, heat, generated, in, boring, cannons, and, developed, the, idea, that, heat, is, a, form, of, kinetic, energy, his, measurements, refuted, caloric, theory, but, were, imprecise, enough, to, leave, room, for, doubt, the, mechanical, equivalence, principle, was, first, stated, in, its, modern, form, by, the, german, surgeon, julius, robert, von, mayer, in, 1842, mayer, reached, his, conclusion, on, a, voyage, to, the, dutch, east, indies, where, he, found, that, his, patients, blood, was, a, deeper, red, because, they, were, consuming, less, oxygen, and, therefore, less, energy, to, maintain, their, body, temperature, in, the, hotter, climate, he, discovered, that, heat, and, mechanical, work, were, both, forms, of, energy, and, in, 1845, after, improving, his, knowledge, of, physics, he, published, a, monograph, that, stated, a, quantitative, relationship, between, them, meanwhile, in, 1843, james, prescott, joule, independently, discovered, the, mechanical, equivalent, in, a, series, of, experiments, in, one, of, them, now, called, the, joule, apparatus, a, descending, weight, attached, to, a, string, caused, a, paddle, immersed, in, water, to, rotate, he, showed, that, the, gravitational, potential, energy, lost, by, the, weight, in, descending, was, equal, to, the, internal, energy, gained, by, the, water, through, friction, with, the, paddle, over, the, period, 1840, 1843, similar, work, was, carried, out, by, engineer, ludwig, a, colding, although, it, was, little, known, outside, his, native, denmark, both, joule, s, and, mayer, s, work, suffered, from, resistance, and, neglect, but, it, was, joule, s, that, eventually, drew, the, wider, recognition, in, 1844, the, welsh, scientist, william, robert, grove, postulated, a, relationship, between, mechanics, heat, light, electricity, and, magnetism, by, treating, them, all, as, manifestations, of, a, single, force, energy, in, modern, terms, in, 1846, grove, published, his, theories, in, his, book, the, correlation, of, physical, forces, in, 1847, drawing, on, the, earlier, work, of, joule, sadi, carnot, and, mile, clapeyron, hermann, von, helmholtz, arrived, at, conclusions, similar, to, grove, s, and, published, his, theories, in, his, book, ber, die, erhaltung, der, kraft, on, the, conservation, of, force, 1847, the, general, modern, acceptance, of, the, principle, stems, from, this, publication, in, 1850, the, scottish, mathematician, william, rankine, first, used, the, phrase, the, law, of, the, conservation, of, energy, for, the, principle, in, 1877, peter, guthrie, tait, claimed, that, the, principle, originated, with, sir, isaac, newton, based, on, a, creative, reading, of, propositions, 40, and, 41, of, the, philosophiae, naturalis, principia, mathematica, this, is, now, regarded, as, an, example, of, whig, history, matter, is, composed, of, atoms, and, what, makes, up, atoms, matter, has, intrinsic, or, rest, mass, in, the, limited, range, of, recognized, experience, of, the, nineteenth, century, it, was, found, that, such, rest, mass, is, conserved, einstein, s, 1905, theory, of, special, relativity, showed, that, rest, mass, corresponds, to, an, equivalent, amount, of, rest, energy, this, means, that, rest, mass, can, be, converted, to, or, from, equivalent, amounts, of, non, material, forms, of, energy, for, example, kinetic, energy, potential, energy, and, electromagnetic, radiant, energy, when, this, happens, as, recognized, in, twentieth, century, experience, rest, mass, is, not, conserved, unlike, the, total, mass, or, total, energy, all, forms, of, energy, contribute, to, the, total, mass, and, total, energy, for, example, an, electron, and, a, positron, each, have, rest, mass, they, can, perish, together, converting, their, combined, rest, energy, into, photons, which, have, electromagnetic, radiant, energy, but, no, rest, mass, if, this, occurs, within, an, isolated, system, that, does, not, release, the, photons, or, their, energy, into, the, external, surroundings, then, neither, the, total, mass, nor, the, total, energy, of, the, system, will, change, the, produced, electromagnetic, radiant, energy, contributes, just, as, much, to, the, inertia, and, to, any, weight, of, the, system, as, did, the, rest, mass, of, the, electron, and, positron, before, their, demise, likewise, non, material, forms, of, energy, can, perish, into, matter, which, has, rest, mass, thus, conservation, of, energy, total, including, material, or, rest, energy, and, conservation, of, mass, total, not, just, rest, are, one, equivalent, law, in, the, 18th, century, these, had, appeared, as, two, seemingly, distinct, laws, the, discovery, in, 1911, that, electrons, emitted, in, beta, decay, have, a, continuous, rather, than, a, discrete, spectrum, appeared, to, contradict, conservation, of, energy, under, the, then, current, assumption, that, beta, decay, is, the, simple, emission, of, an, electron, from, a, nucleus, this, problem, was, eventually, resolved, in, 1933, by, enrico, fermi, who, proposed, the, correct, description, of, beta, decay, as, the, emission, of, both, an, electron, and, an, antineutrino, which, carries, away, the, apparently, missing, energy, for, a, closed, thermodynamic, system, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, may, be, stated, as, where, q, displaystyle, delta, q, is, the, quantity, of, energy, added, to, the, system, by, a, heating, process, w, displaystyle, delta, w, is, the, quantity, of, energy, lost, by, the, system, due, to, work, done, by, the, system, on, its, surroundings, and, d, u, displaystyle, mathrm, d, u, is, the, change, in, the, internal, energy, of, the, system, the, s, before, the, heat, and, work, terms, are, used, to, indicate, that, they, describe, an, increment, of, energy, which, is, to, be, interpreted, somewhat, differently, than, the, d, u, displaystyle, mathrm, d, u, increment, of, internal, energy, see, inexact, differential, work, and, heat, refer, to, kinds, of, process, which, add, or, subtract, energy, to, or, from, a, system, while, the, internal, energy, u, displaystyle, u, is, a, property, of, a, particular, state, of, the, system, when, it, is, in, unchanging, thermodynamic, equilibrium, thus, the, term, heat, energy, for, q, displaystyle, delta, q, means, that, amount, of, energy, added, as, a, result, of, heating, rather, than, referring, to, a, particular, form, of, energy, likewise, the, term, work, energy, for, w, displaystyle, delta, w, means, that, amount, of, energy, lost, as, a, result, of, work, thus, one, can, state, the, amount, of, internal, energy, possessed, by, a, thermodynamic, system, that, one, knows, is, presently, in, a, given, state, but, one, cannot, tell, just, from, knowledge, of, the, given, present, state, how, much, energy, has, in, the, past, flowed, into, or, out, of, the, system, as, a, result, of, its, being, heated, or, cooled, nor, as, a, result, of, work, being, performed, on, or, by, the, system, entropy, is, a, function, of, the, state, of, a, system, which, tells, of, limitations, of, the, possibility, of, conversion, of, heat, into, work, for, a, simple, compressible, system, the, work, performed, by, the, system, may, be, written, where, p, displaystyle, p, is, the, pressure, and, d, v, displaystyle, dv, is, a, small, change, in, the, volume, of, the, system, each, of, which, are, system, variables, in, the, fictive, case, in, which, the, process, is, idealized, and, infinitely, slow, so, as, to, be, called, quasi, static, and, regarded, as, reversible, the, heat, being, transferred, from, a, source, with, temperature, infinitesimally, above, the, system, temperature, the, heat, energy, may, be, written, where, t, displaystyle, t, is, the, temperature, and, d, s, displaystyle, mathrm, d, s, is, a, small, change, in, the, entropy, of, the, system, temperature, and, entropy, are, variables, of, the, state, of, a, system, if, an, open, system, in, which, mass, may, be, exchanged, with, the, environment, has, several, walls, such, that, the, mass, transfer, is, through, rigid, walls, separate, from, the, heat, and, work, transfers, then, the, first, law, may, be, written, as, where, d, m, i, displaystyle, dm, i, is, the, added, mass, of, species, i, displaystyle, i, and, h, i, displaystyle, h, i, is, the, corresponding, enthalpy, per, unit, mass, note, that, generally, d, s, q, t, displaystyle, ds, neq, delta, q, t, in, this, case, as, matter, carries, its, own, entropy, instead, d, s, q, t, i, s, i, d, m, i, displaystyle, ds, delta, q, t, textstyle, sum, i, s, i, dm, i, where, s, i, displaystyle, s, i, is, the, entropy, per, unit, mass, of, type, i, displaystyle, i, from, which, we, recover, the, fundamental, thermodynamic, relation, because, the, chemical, potential, i, displaystyle, mu, i, is, the, partial, molar, gibbs, free, energy, of, species, i, displaystyle, i, and, the, gibbs, free, energy, g, h, t, s, displaystyle, g, equiv, h, ts, the, conservation, of, energy, is, a, common, feature, in, many, physical, theories, from, a, mathematical, point, of, view, it, is, understood, as, a, consequence, of, noether, s, theorem, developed, by, emmy, noether, in, 1915, and, first, published, in, 1918, in, any, physical, theory, that, obeys, the, stationary, action, principle, the, theorem, states, that, every, continuous, symmetry, has, an, associated, conserved, quantity, if, the, theory, s, symmetry, is, time, invariance, then, the, conserved, quantity, is, called, energy, the, energy, conservation, law, is, a, consequence, of, the, shift, symmetry, of, time, energy, conservation, is, implied, by, the, empirical, fact, that, the, laws, of, physics, do, not, change, with, time, itself, philosophically, this, can, be, stated, as, nothing, depends, on, time, per, se, in, other, words, if, the, physical, system, is, invariant, under, the, continuous, symmetry, of, time, translation, then, its, energy, which, is, the, canonical, conjugate, quantity, to, time, is, conserved, conversely, systems, that, are, not, invariant, under, shifts, in, time, e, g, systems, with, time, dependent, potential, energy, do, not, exhibit, conservation, of, energy, unless, we, consider, them, to, exchange, energy, with, another, external, system, so, that, the, theory, of, the, enlarged, system, becomes, time, invariant, again, conservation, of, energy, for, finite, systems, is, valid, in, physical, theories, such, as, special, relativity, and, quantum, theory, including, qed, in, the, flat, space, time, with, the, discovery, of, special, relativity, by, henri, poincar, and, albert, einstein, the, energy, was, proposed, to, be, a, component, of, an, energy, momentum, 4, vector, each, of, the, four, components, one, of, energy, and, three, of, momentum, of, this, vector, is, separately, conserved, across, time, in, any, closed, system, as, seen, from, any, given, inertial, reference, frame, also, conserved, is, the, vector, length, minkowski, norm, which, is, the, rest, mass, for, single, particles, and, the, invariant, mass, for, systems, of, particles, where, momenta, and, energy, are, separately, summed, before, the, length, is, calculated, the, relativistic, energy, of, a, single, massive, particle, contains, a, term, related, to, its, rest, mass, in, addition, to, its, kinetic, energy, of, motion, in, the, limit, of, zero, kinetic, energy, or, equivalently, in, the, rest, frame, of, a, massive, particle, or, else, in, the, center, of, momentum, frame, for, objects, or, systems, which, retain, kinetic, energy, the, total, energy, of, a, particle, or, object, including, internal, kinetic, energy, in, systems, is, proportional, to, the, rest, mass, or, invariant, mass, as, described, by, the, equation, e, m, c, 2, displaystyle, e, mc, 2, thus, the, rule, of, conservation, of, energy, over, time, in, special, relativity, continues, to, hold, so, long, as, the, reference, frame, of, the, observer, is, unchanged, this, applies, to, the, total, energy, of, systems, although, different, observers, disagree, as, to, the, energy, value, also, conserved, and, invariant, to, all, observers, is, the, invariant, mass, which, is, the, minimal, system, mass, and, energy, that, can, be, seen, by, any, observer, and, which, is, defined, by, the, energy, momentum, relation, general, relativity, introduces, new, phenomena, in, an, expanding, universe, photons, spontaneously, redshift, and, tethers, spontaneously, gain, tension, if, vacuum, energy, is, positive, the, total, vacuum, energy, of, the, universe, appears, to, spontaneously, increase, as, the, volume, of, space, increases, some, scholars, claim, that, energy, is, no, longer, meaningfully, conserved, in, any, identifiable, form, john, baez, s, view, is, that, energy, momentum, conservation, is, not, well, defined, except, in, certain, special, cases, energy, momentum, is, typically, expressed, with, the, aid, of, a, stress, energy, momentum, pseudotensor, however, since, pseudotensors, are, not, tensors, they, do, not, transform, cleanly, between, reference, frames, if, the, metric, under, consideration, is, static, that, is, does, not, change, with, time, or, asymptotically, flat, that, is, at, an, infinite, distance, away, spacetime, looks, empty, then, energy, conservation, holds, without, major, pitfalls, in, practice, some, metrics, notably, the, friedmann, lema, tre, robertson, walker, metric, that, appears, to, govern, the, universe, do, not, satisfy, these, constraints, and, energy, conservation, is, not, well, defined, besides, being, dependent, on, the, coordinate, system, pseudotensor, energy, is, dependent, on, the, type, of, pseudotensor, in, use, for, example, the, energy, exterior, to, a, kerr, newman, black, hole, is, twice, as, large, when, calculated, from, m, ller, s, pseudotensor, as, it, is, when, calculated, using, the, einstein, pseudotensor, for, asymptotically, flat, universes, einstein, and, others, salvage, conservation, of, energy, by, introducing, a, specific, global, gravitational, potential, energy, that, cancels, out, mass, energy, changes, triggered, by, spacetime, expansion, or, contraction, this, global, energy, has, no, well, defined, density, and, cannot, technically, be, applied, to, a, non, asymptotically, flat, universe, however, for, practical, purposes, this, can, be, finessed, and, so, by, this, view, energy, is, conserved, in, our, universe, alan, guth, stated, that, the, universe, might, be, the, ultimate, free, lunch, and, theorized, that, when, accounting, for, gravitational, potential, energy, the, net, energy, of, the, universe, is, zero, in, quantum, mechanics, the, energy, of, a, quantum, system, is, described, by, a, self, adjoint, or, hermitian, operator, called, the, hamiltonian, which, acts, on, the, hilbert, space, or, a, space, of, wave, functions, of, the, system, if, the, hamiltonian, is, a, time, independent, operator, emergence, probability, of, the, measurement, result, does, not, change, in, time, over, the, evolution, of, the, system, thus, the, expectation, value, of, energy, is, also, time, independent, the, local, energy, conservation, in, quantum, field, theory, is, ensured, by, the, quantum, noether, s, theorem, for, the, energy, momentum, tensor, operator, thus, energy, is, conserved, by, the, normal, unitary, evolution, of, a, quantum, system, however, when, the, non, unitary, born, rule, is, applied, the, system, s, energy, is, measured, with, an, energy, that, can, be, below, or, above, the, expectation, value, if, the, system, was, not, in, an, energy, eigenstate, for, macroscopic, systems, this, effect, is, usually, too, small, to, measure, the, disposition, of, this, energy, gap, is, not, well, understood, most, physicists, believe, that, the, energy, is, transferred, to, or, from, the, macroscopic, environment, in, the, course, of, the, measurement, process, while, others, believe, that, the, observable, energy, is, only, conserved, on, average, no, experiment, has, been, confirmed, as, definitive, evidence, of, violations, of, the, conservation, of, energy, principle, in, quantum, mechanics, but, that, does, not, rule, out, that, some, newer, experiments, as, proposed, may, find, evidence, of, violations, of, the, conservation, of, energy, principle, in, quantum, mechanics, in, the, context, of, perpetual, motion, machines, such, as, the, orbo, professor, eric, ash, has, argued, at, the, bbc, denying, would, undermine, not, just, little, bits, of, science, the, whole, edifice, would, be, no, more, all, of, the, technology, on, which, we, built, the, modern, world, would, lie, in, ruins, it, is, because, of, conservation, of, energy, that, we, know, without, having, to, examine, details, of, a, particular, device, that, orbo, cannot, work, energy, conservation, has, been, a, foundational, physical, principle, for, about, two, hundred, years, from, the, point, of, view, of, modern, general, relativity, the, lab, environment, can, be, well, approximated, by, minkowski, spacetime, where, energy, is, exactly, conserved, the, entire, earth, can, be, well, approximated, by, the, schwarzschild, metric, where, again, energy, is, exactly, conserved, given, all, the, experimental, evidence, any, new, theory, such, as, quantum, gravity, in, order, to, be, successful, will, have, to, explain, why, energy, has, appeared, to, always, be, exactly, conserved, in, terrestrial, experiments, in, some, speculative, theories, corrections, to, quantum, mechanics, are, too, small, to, be, detected, at, anywhere, near, the, current, tev, level, accessible, through, particle, accelerators, doubly, special, relativity, models, may, argue, for, a, breakdown, in, energy, momentum, conservation, for, sufficiently, energetic, particles, such, models, are, constrained, by, observations, that, cosmic, rays, appear, to, travel, for, billions, of, years, without, displaying, anomalous, non, conservation, behavior, some, interpretations, of, quantum, mechanics, claim, that, observed, energy, tends, to, increase, when, the, born, rule, is, applied, due, to, localization, of, the, wave, function, if, true, objects, could, be, expected, to, spontaneously, heat, up, thus, such, models, are, constrained, by, observations, of, large, cool, astronomical, objects, as, well, as, the, observation, of, often, supercooled, laboratory, experiments, milton, a, rothman, wrote, that, the, law, of, conservation, of, energy, has, been, verified, by, nuclear, physics, experiments, to, an, accuracy, of, one, part, in, a, thousand, million, million, 10, 15, he, then, defines, its, precision, as, perfect, for, all, practical, purposes
