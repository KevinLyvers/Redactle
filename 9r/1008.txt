solid, mechanics, also, known, as, mechanics, of, solids, is, the, branch, of, continuum, mechanics, that, studies, the, behavior, of, solid, materials, especially, their, motion, and, deformation, under, the, action, of, forces, temperature, changes, phase, changes, and, other, external, or, internal, agents, solid, mechanics, is, fundamental, for, civil, aerospace, nuclear, biomedical, and, mechanical, engineering, for, geology, and, for, many, branches, of, physics, and, chemistry, such, as, materials, science, it, has, specific, applications, in, many, other, areas, such, as, understanding, the, anatomy, of, living, beings, and, the, design, of, dental, prostheses, and, surgical, implants, one, of, the, most, common, practical, applications, of, solid, mechanics, is, the, euler, bernoulli, beam, equation, solid, mechanics, extensively, uses, tensors, to, describe, stresses, strains, and, the, relationship, between, them, solid, mechanics, is, a, vast, subject, because, of, the, wide, range, of, solid, materials, available, such, as, steel, wood, concrete, biological, materials, textiles, geological, materials, and, plastics, a, solid, is, a, material, that, can, support, a, substantial, amount, of, shearing, force, over, a, given, time, scale, during, a, natural, or, industrial, process, or, action, this, is, what, distinguishes, solids, from, fluids, because, fluids, also, support, normal, forces, which, are, those, forces, that, are, directed, perpendicular, to, the, material, plane, across, from, which, they, act, and, normal, stress, is, the, normal, force, per, unit, area, of, that, material, plane, shearing, forces, in, contrast, with, normal, forces, act, parallel, rather, than, perpendicular, to, the, material, plane, and, the, shearing, force, per, unit, area, is, called, shear, stress, therefore, solid, mechanics, examines, the, shear, stress, deformation, and, the, failure, of, solid, materials, and, structures, the, most, common, topics, covered, in, solid, mechanics, include, as, shown, in, the, following, table, solid, mechanics, inhabits, a, central, place, within, continuum, mechanics, the, field, of, rheology, presents, an, overlap, between, solid, and, fluid, mechanics, a, material, has, a, rest, shape, and, its, shape, departs, away, from, the, rest, shape, due, to, stress, the, amount, of, departure, from, rest, shape, is, called, deformation, the, proportion, of, deformation, to, original, size, is, called, strain, if, the, applied, stress, is, sufficiently, low, or, the, imposed, strain, is, small, enough, almost, all, solid, materials, behave, in, such, a, way, that, the, strain, is, directly, proportional, to, the, stress, the, coefficient, of, the, proportion, is, called, the, modulus, of, elasticity, this, region, of, deformation, is, known, as, the, linearly, elastic, region, it, is, most, common, for, analysts, in, solid, mechanics, to, use, linear, material, models, due, to, ease, of, computation, however, real, materials, often, exhibit, non, linear, behavior, as, new, materials, are, used, and, old, ones, are, pushed, to, their, limits, non, linear, material, models, are, becoming, more, common, these, are, basic, models, that, describe, how, a, solid, responds, to, an, applied, stress
