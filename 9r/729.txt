the, sky, is, an, unobstructed, view, upward, from, the, surface, of, the, earth, it, includes, the, atmosphere, and, outer, space, it, may, also, be, considered, a, place, between, the, ground, and, outer, space, thus, distinct, from, outer, space, in, the, field, of, astronomy, the, sky, is, also, called, the, celestial, sphere, this, is, an, abstract, sphere, concentric, to, the, earth, on, which, the, sun, moon, planets, and, stars, appear, to, be, drifting, the, celestial, sphere, is, conventionally, divided, into, designated, areas, called, constellations, usually, the, term, sky, informally, refers, to, a, perspective, from, the, earth, s, surface, however, the, meaning, and, usage, can, vary, an, observer, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, can, see, a, small, part, of, the, sky, which, resembles, a, dome, sometimes, called, the, sky, bowl, appearing, flatter, during, the, day, than, at, night, in, some, cases, such, as, in, discussing, the, weather, the, sky, refers, to, only, the, lower, denser, layers, of, the, atmosphere, the, daytime, sky, appears, blue, because, air, molecules, scatter, shorter, wavelengths, of, sunlight, more, than, longer, ones, redder, light, the, night, sky, appears, to, be, a, mostly, dark, surface, or, region, spangled, with, stars, the, sun, and, sometimes, the, moon, are, visible, in, the, daytime, sky, unless, obscured, by, clouds, at, night, the, moon, planets, and, stars, are, similarly, visible, in, the, sky, some, of, the, natural, phenomena, seen, in, the, sky, are, clouds, rainbows, and, aurorae, lightning, and, precipitation, are, also, visible, in, the, sky, certain, birds, and, insects, as, well, as, human, inventions, like, aircraft, and, kites, can, fly, in, the, sky, due, to, human, activities, smog, during, the, day, and, light, pollution, during, the, night, are, often, seen, above, large, cities, the, word, sky, comes, from, the, old, norse, sky, meaning, cloud, abode, of, god, the, norse, term, is, also, the, source, of, the, old, english, sc, o, which, shares, the, same, indo, european, base, as, the, classical, latin, obsc, rus, meaning, obscure, in, old, english, the, term, heaven, was, used, to, describe, the, observable, expanse, above, the, earth, during, the, period, of, middle, english, heaven, began, shifting, toward, its, current, religious, meaning, except, for, direct, sunlight, most, of, the, light, in, the, daytime, sky, is, caused, by, scattering, which, is, dominated, by, a, small, particle, limit, called, rayleigh, scattering, the, scattering, due, to, molecule, sized, particles, as, in, air, is, greater, in, the, directions, both, toward, and, away, from, the, source, of, light, than, it, is, in, directions, perpendicular, to, the, incident, path, scattering, is, significant, for, light, at, all, visible, wavelengths, but, is, stronger, at, the, shorter, bluer, end, of, the, visible, spectrum, meaning, that, the, scattered, light, is, bluer, than, its, source, the, sun, the, remaining, direct, sunlight, having, lost, some, of, its, shorter, wavelength, components, appears, slightly, less, blue, scattering, also, occurs, even, more, strongly, in, clouds, individual, water, droplets, refract, white, light, into, a, set, of, colored, rings, if, a, cloud, is, thick, enough, scattering, from, multiple, water, droplets, will, wash, out, the, set, of, colored, rings, and, create, a, washed, out, white, color, the, sky, can, turn, a, multitude, of, colors, such, as, red, orange, purple, and, yellow, especially, near, sunset, or, sunrise, when, the, light, must, travel, a, much, longer, path, or, optical, depth, through, the, atmosphere, scattering, effects, also, partially, polarize, light, from, the, sky, and, are, most, pronounced, at, an, angle, 90, from, the, sun, scattered, light, from, the, horizon, travels, through, as, much, as, 38, times, the, air, mass, as, does, light, from, the, zenith, causing, a, blue, gradient, looking, vivid, at, the, zenith, and, pale, near, the, horizon, red, light, is, also, scattered, if, there, is, enough, air, between, the, source, and, the, observer, causing, parts, of, the, sky, to, change, color, as, the, sun, rises, or, sets, as, the, air, mass, nears, infinity, scattered, daylight, appears, whiter, and, whiter, apart, from, the, sun, distant, clouds, or, snowy, mountaintops, may, appear, yellow, the, effect, is, not, very, obvious, on, clear, days, but, is, very, pronounced, when, clouds, cover, the, line, of, sight, reducing, the, blue, hue, from, scattered, sunlight, at, higher, altitudes, the, sky, tends, toward, darker, colors, since, scattering, is, reduced, due, to, lower, air, density, an, extreme, example, is, the, moon, where, no, atmospheric, scattering, occurs, making, the, lunar, sky, black, even, when, the, sun, is, visible, sky, luminance, distribution, models, have, been, recommended, by, the, international, commission, on, illumination, cie, for, the, design, of, daylighting, schemes, recent, developments, relate, to, all, sky, models, for, modelling, sky, luminance, under, weather, conditions, ranging, from, clear, to, overcast, the, brightness, and, color, of, the, sky, vary, greatly, over, the, course, of, a, day, and, the, primary, cause, of, these, properties, differs, as, well, when, the, sun, is, well, above, the, horizon, direct, scattering, of, sunlight, rayleigh, scattering, is, the, overwhelmingly, dominant, source, of, light, however, during, twilight, the, period, between, sunset, and, night, or, between, night, and, sunrise, the, situation, is, more, complex, green, flashes, and, green, rays, are, optical, phenomena, that, occur, shortly, after, sunset, or, before, sunrise, when, a, green, spot, is, visible, above, the, sun, usually, for, no, more, than, a, second, or, two, or, it, may, resemble, a, green, ray, shooting, up, from, the, sunset, point, green, flashes, are, a, group, of, phenomena, that, stem, from, different, causes, most, of, which, occur, when, there, is, a, temperature, inversion, when, the, temperature, increases, with, altitude, rather, than, the, normal, decrease, in, temperature, with, altitude, green, flashes, may, be, observed, from, any, altitude, even, from, an, aircraft, they, are, usually, seen, above, an, unobstructed, horizon, such, as, over, the, ocean, but, are, also, seen, above, clouds, and, mountains, green, flashes, may, also, be, observed, at, the, horizon, in, association, with, the, moon, and, bright, planets, including, venus, and, jupiter, earth, s, shadow, is, the, shadow, that, the, planet, casts, through, its, atmosphere, and, into, outer, space, this, atmospheric, phenomenon, is, visible, during, civil, twilight, after, sunset, and, before, sunrise, when, the, weather, conditions, and, the, observing, site, permit, a, clear, view, of, the, horizon, the, shadow, s, fringe, appears, as, a, dark, or, dull, bluish, band, just, above, the, horizon, in, the, low, part, of, the, sky, opposite, of, the, setting, or, rising, sun, s, direction, a, related, phenomenon, is, the, belt, of, venus, or, antitwilight, arch, a, pinkish, band, that, is, visible, above, the, bluish, band, of, earth, s, shadow, in, the, same, part, of, the, sky, no, defined, line, divides, earth, s, shadow, and, the, belt, of, venus, one, colored, band, fades, into, the, other, in, the, sky, twilight, is, divided, into, three, stages, according, to, the, sun, s, depth, below, the, horizon, measured, in, segments, of, 6, after, sunset, the, civil, twilight, sets, in, it, ends, when, the, sun, drops, more, than, 6, below, the, horizon, this, is, followed, by, the, nautical, twilight, when, the, sun, is, between, 6, and, 12, below, the, horizon, depth, between, 6, and, 12, after, which, comes, the, astronomical, twilight, defined, as, the, period, between, 12, and, 18, when, the, sun, drops, more, than, 18, below, the, horizon, the, sky, generally, attains, its, minimum, brightness, several, sources, can, be, identified, as, the, source, of, the, intrinsic, brightness, of, the, sky, namely, airglow, indirect, scattering, of, sunlight, scattering, of, starlight, and, artificial, light, pollution, the, term, night, sky, refers, to, the, sky, as, seen, at, night, the, term, is, usually, associated, with, skygazing, and, astronomy, with, reference, to, views, of, celestial, bodies, such, as, stars, the, moon, and, planets, that, become, visible, on, a, clear, night, after, the, sun, has, set, natural, light, sources, in, a, night, sky, include, moonlight, starlight, and, airglow, depending, on, location, and, timing, the, fact, that, the, sky, is, not, completely, dark, at, night, can, be, easily, observed, were, the, sky, in, the, absence, of, moon, and, city, lights, absolutely, dark, one, would, not, be, able, to, see, the, silhouette, of, an, object, against, the, sky, the, night, sky, and, studies, of, it, have, a, historical, place, in, both, ancient, and, modern, cultures, in, the, past, for, instance, farmers, have, used, the, state, of, the, night, sky, as, a, calendar, to, determine, when, to, plant, crops, the, ancient, belief, in, astrology, is, generally, based, on, the, belief, that, relationships, between, heavenly, bodies, influence, or, convey, information, about, events, on, earth, the, scientific, study, of, the, night, sky, and, bodies, observed, within, it, meanwhile, takes, place, in, the, science, of, astronomy, within, visible, light, astronomy, the, visibility, of, celestial, objects, in, the, night, sky, is, affected, by, light, pollution, the, presence, of, the, moon, in, the, night, sky, has, historically, hindered, astronomical, observation, by, increasing, the, amount, of, ambient, lighting, with, the, advent, of, artificial, light, sources, however, light, pollution, has, been, a, growing, problem, for, viewing, the, night, sky, special, filters, and, modifications, to, light, fixtures, can, help, to, alleviate, this, problem, but, for, the, best, views, both, professional, and, amateur, optical, astronomers, seek, viewing, sites, located, far, from, major, urban, areas, along, with, pressure, tendency, the, condition, of, the, sky, is, one, of, the, more, important, parameters, used, to, forecast, weather, in, mountainous, areas, thickening, of, cloud, cover, or, the, invasion, of, a, higher, cloud, deck, is, indicative, of, rain, in, the, near, future, at, night, high, thin, cirrostratus, clouds, can, lead, to, halos, around, the, moon, which, indicate, the, approach, of, a, warm, front, and, its, associated, rain, morning, fog, portends, fair, conditions, and, can, be, associated, with, a, marine, layer, an, indication, of, a, stable, atmosphere, rainy, conditions, are, preceded, by, wind, or, clouds, which, prevent, fog, formation, the, approach, of, a, line, of, thunderstorms, could, indicate, the, approach, of, a, cold, front, cloud, free, skies, are, indicative, of, fair, weather, for, the, near, future, the, use, of, sky, cover, in, weather, prediction, has, led, to, various, weather, lore, over, the, centuries, within, 36, hours, of, the, passage, of, a, tropical, cyclone, s, center, the, pressure, begins, to, fall, and, a, veil, of, white, cirrus, clouds, approaches, from, the, cyclone, s, direction, within, 24, hours, of, the, closest, approach, to, the, center, low, clouds, begin, to, move, in, also, known, as, the, bar, of, a, tropical, cyclone, as, the, barometric, pressure, begins, to, fall, more, rapidly, and, the, winds, begin, to, increase, within, 18, hours, of, the, center, s, approach, squally, weather, is, common, with, sudden, increases, in, wind, accompanied, by, rain, showers, or, thunderstorms, within, six, hours, of, the, center, s, arrival, rain, becomes, continuous, within, an, hour, of, the, center, the, rain, becomes, very, heavy, and, the, highest, winds, within, the, tropical, cyclone, are, experienced, when, the, center, arrives, with, a, strong, tropical, cyclone, weather, conditions, improve, and, the, sun, becomes, visible, as, the, eye, moves, overhead, once, the, system, departs, winds, reverse, and, along, with, the, rain, suddenly, increase, one, day, after, the, center, s, passage, the, low, overcast, is, replaced, with, a, higher, overcast, and, the, rain, becomes, intermittent, by, 36, hours, after, the, center, s, passage, the, high, overcast, breaks, and, the, pressure, begins, to, level, off, flight, is, the, process, by, which, an, object, moves, through, or, beyond, the, sky, as, in, the, case, of, spaceflight, whether, by, generating, aerodynamic, lift, propulsive, thrust, aerostatically, using, buoyancy, or, by, ballistic, movement, without, any, direct, mechanical, support, from, the, ground, the, engineering, aspects, of, flight, are, studied, in, aerospace, engineering, which, is, subdivided, into, aeronautics, which, is, the, study, of, vehicles, that, travel, through, the, air, and, astronautics, the, study, of, vehicles, that, travel, through, space, and, in, ballistics, the, study, of, the, flight, of, projectiles, while, human, beings, have, been, capable, of, flight, via, hot, air, balloons, since, 1783, other, species, have, used, flight, for, significantly, longer, animals, such, as, birds, bats, and, insects, are, capable, of, flight, spores, and, seeds, from, plants, use, flight, via, use, of, the, wind, as, a, method, of, propagating, their, species, many, mythologies, have, deities, especially, associated, with, the, sky, in, egyptian, religion, the, sky, was, deified, as, the, goddess, nut, and, as, the, god, horus, dyeus, is, reconstructed, as, the, god, of, the, sky, or, the, sky, personified, in, proto, indo, european, religion, whence, zeus, the, god, of, the, sky, and, thunder, in, greek, mythology, and, the, roman, god, of, sky, and, thunder, jupiter, in, australian, aboriginal, mythology, altjira, or, arrernte, is, the, main, sky, god, and, also, the, creator, god, in, iroquois, mythology, atahensic, was, a, sky, goddess, who, fell, down, to, the, ground, during, the, creation, of, the, earth, many, cultures, have, drawn, constellations, between, stars, in, the, sky, using, them, in, association, with, legends, and, mythology, about, their, deities
