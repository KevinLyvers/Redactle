a, laboratory, uk, l, b, r, t, r, i, us, l, b, r, t, r, i, colloquially, lab, is, a, facility, that, provides, controlled, conditions, in, which, scientific, or, technological, research, experiments, and, measurement, may, be, performed, laboratories, are, found, in, a, variety, of, settings, such, as, schools, universities, privately, owned, research, institutions, corporate, research, and, testing, facilities, government, regulatory, and, forensic, investigation, centers, physicians, offices, clinics, hospitals, regional, and, national, referral, centers, and, even, occasionally, personal, residences, the, organisation, and, contents, of, laboratories, are, determined, by, the, differing, requirements, of, the, specialists, working, within, a, physics, laboratory, might, contain, a, particle, accelerator, or, vacuum, chamber, while, a, metallurgy, laboratory, could, have, apparatus, for, casting, or, refining, metals, or, for, testing, their, strength, a, chemist, or, biologist, might, use, a, wet, laboratory, while, a, psychologist, s, laboratory, might, be, a, room, with, one, way, mirrors, and, hidden, cameras, in, which, to, observe, behavior, in, some, laboratories, such, as, those, commonly, used, by, computer, scientists, computers, sometimes, supercomputers, are, used, for, either, simulations, or, the, analysis, of, data, scientists, in, other, fields, will, still, use, other, types, of, laboratories, engineers, use, laboratories, as, well, to, design, build, and, test, technological, devices, scientific, laboratories, can, be, found, as, research, room, and, learning, spaces, in, schools, and, universities, industry, government, or, military, facilities, and, even, aboard, ships, and, spacecraft, despite, the, underlying, notion, of, the, lab, as, a, confined, space, for, experts, the, term, laboratory, is, also, increasingly, applied, to, workshop, spaces, such, as, living, labs, fab, labs, or, hackerspaces, in, which, people, meet, to, work, on, societal, problems, or, make, prototypes, working, collaboratively, or, sharing, resources, this, development, is, inspired, by, new, participatory, approaches, to, science, and, innovation, and, relies, on, user, centred, design, methods, and, concepts, like, open, innovation, or, user, innovation, one, distinctive, feature, of, work, in, open, labs, is, the, phenomenon, of, translation, driven, by, the, different, backgrounds, and, levels, of, expertise, of, the, people, involved, early, instances, of, laboratories, recorded, in, english, involved, alchemy, and, the, preparation, of, medicines, the, emergence, of, big, science, during, world, war, ii, increased, the, size, of, laboratories, and, scientific, equipment, introducing, particle, accelerators, and, similar, devices, the, earliest, laboratory, according, to, the, present, evidence, is, a, home, laboratory, of, pythagoras, of, samos, the, well, known, greek, philosopher, and, scientist, this, laboratory, was, created, when, pythagoras, conducted, an, experiment, about, tones, of, sound, and, vibration, of, string, in, the, painting, of, louis, pasteur, by, albert, edelfelt, in, 1885, louis, pasteur, is, shown, comparing, a, note, in, his, left, hand, with, a, bottle, filled, with, a, solid, in, his, right, hand, and, not, wearing, any, personal, protective, equipment, researching, in, teams, started, in, the, 19th, century, and, many, new, kinds, of, equipment, were, developed, in, the, 20th, century, a, 16th, century, underground, alchemical, laboratory, was, accidentally, discovered, in, the, year, 2002, rudolf, ii, holy, roman, emperor, was, believed, to, be, the, owner, the, laboratory, is, called, speculum, alchemiae, and, is, preserved, as, a, museum, in, prague, laboratory, techniques, are, the, set, of, procedures, used, on, natural, sciences, such, as, chemistry, biology, physics, to, conduct, an, experiment, while, some, of, them, involve, the, use, of, complex, laboratory, equipment, from, laboratory, glassware, to, electrical, devices, and, others, require, more, specific, or, expensive, supplies, laboratory, equipment, refers, to, the, various, tools, and, equipment, used, by, scientists, working, in, a, laboratory, laboratory, equipment, is, generally, used, to, either, perform, an, experiment, or, to, take, measurements, and, gather, data, larger, or, more, sophisticated, equipment, is, generally, called, a, scientific, instrument, the, classical, equipment, includes, tools, such, as, bunsen, burners, and, microscopes, as, well, as, specialty, equipment, such, as, operant, conditioning, chambers, spectrophotometers, and, calorimeters, the, title, of, laboratory, is, also, used, for, certain, other, facilities, where, the, processes, or, equipment, used, are, similar, to, those, in, scientific, laboratories, these, notably, include, in, many, laboratories, hazards, are, present, laboratory, hazards, might, include, poisons, infectious, agents, flammable, explosive, or, radioactive, materials, moving, machinery, extreme, temperatures, lasers, strong, magnetic, fields, or, high, voltage, therefore, safety, precautions, are, vitally, important, rules, exist, to, minimize, the, individual, s, risk, and, safety, equipment, is, used, to, protect, the, lab, users, from, injury, or, to, assist, in, responding, to, an, emergency, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, in, the, united, states, recognizing, the, unique, characteristics, of, the, laboratory, workplace, has, tailored, a, standard, for, occupational, exposure, to, hazardous, chemicals, in, laboratories, this, standard, is, often, referred, to, as, the, laboratory, standard, under, this, standard, a, laboratory, is, required, to, produce, a, chemical, hygiene, plan, chp, which, addresses, the, specific, hazards, found, in, its, location, and, its, approach, to, them, in, determining, the, proper, chemical, hygiene, plan, for, a, particular, business, or, laboratory, it, is, necessary, to, understand, the, requirements, of, the, standard, evaluation, of, the, current, safety, health, and, environmental, practices, and, assessment, of, the, hazards, the, chp, must, be, reviewed, annually, many, schools, and, businesses, employ, safety, health, and, environmental, specialists, such, as, a, chemical, hygiene, officer, cho, to, develop, manage, and, evaluate, their, chp, additionally, third, party, review, is, also, used, to, provide, an, objective, outside, view, which, provides, a, fresh, look, at, areas, and, problems, that, may, be, taken, for, granted, or, overlooked, due, to, habit, inspections, and, audits, like, also, be, conducted, on, a, regular, basis, to, assess, hazards, due, to, chemical, handling, and, storage, electrical, equipment, biohazards, hazardous, waste, management, chemical, waste, housekeeping, and, emergency, preparedness, radiation, safety, ventilation, as, well, as, respiratory, testing, and, indoor, air, quality, an, important, element, of, such, audits, is, the, review, of, regulatory, compliance, and, the, training, of, individuals, who, have, access, to, or, work, in, the, laboratory, training, is, critical, to, the, ongoing, safe, operation, of, the, laboratory, facility, educators, staff, and, management, must, be, engaged, in, working, to, reduce, the, likelihood, of, accidents, injuries, and, potential, litigation, efforts, are, made, to, ensure, laboratory, safety, videos, are, both, relevant, and, engaging, the, effects, of, climate, change, are, becoming, more, of, a, concern, for, organizations, and, mitigation, strategies, are, being, sought, by, the, research, community, while, many, laboratories, are, used, to, perform, research, to, find, innovative, solutions, to, this, global, challenge, sustainable, working, practices, in, the, labs, are, also, contributing, factors, towards, a, greener, environment, many, labs, are, already, trying, to, minimize, their, environmental, impact, by, reducing, energy, consumption, recycling, and, implementing, waste, sorting, processes, to, ensure, correct, disposal, research, labs, featuring, energy, intensive, equipment, use, up, to, three, to, five, times, more, energy, per, square, meter, than, office, areas, presumably, the, major, contributor, to, this, high, energy, consumption, are, fume, hoods, significant, impact, can, be, achieved, by, keeping, the, opening, height, as, low, as, possible, when, working, and, keeping, them, closed, when, not, in, use, one, possibility, to, help, with, this, could, be, to, install, automatic, systems, which, close, the, hoods, after, an, inactivity, period, of, a, certain, length, and, turn, off, the, lights, as, well, so, the, flow, can, be, regulated, better, and, is, not, unnecessarily, kept, at, a, very, high, level, normally, ult, freezers, are, kept, at, 80, c, one, such, device, can, consume, up, to, the, same, amount, of, energy, as, a, single, family, household, 25, kwh, day, increasing, the, temperature, to, 70, c, makes, it, possible, to, use, 40, less, energy, and, still, keep, most, samples, safely, stored, minimizing, the, consumption, of, water, can, be, achieved, by, changing, from, water, cooled, condensers, dimroth, condenser, to, air, cooled, condensers, vigreux, column, which, take, advantage, of, the, large, surface, area, to, cool, the, use, of, ovens, is, very, helpful, to, dry, glassware, but, those, installations, can, consume, a, lot, of, energy, employing, timers, to, regulate, their, use, during, nights, and, weekends, can, reduce, their, impact, on, energy, consumption, enormously, the, disposal, of, chemically, biologically, contaminated, waste, requires, a, lot, of, energy, regular, waste, however, requires, much, less, energy, or, can, even, be, recycled, to, some, degree, not, every, object, in, a, lab, is, contaminated, but, often, ends, up, in, the, contaminated, waste, driving, up, energy, costs, for, waste, disposal, a, good, sorting, and, recycling, system, for, non, contaminated, lab, waste, will, allow, lab, users, to, act, sustainably, and, correctly, dispose, of, waste, as, of, 2021, there, are, numerous, laboratories, currently, dedicating, time, and, resources, to, move, towards, more, sustainable, lab, practices, at, their, facilities, e, g, mit, and, the, university, of, edingburgh, furthermore, several, networks, have, emerged, such, as, green, your, lab, towards, greener, research, the, uk, based, network, lean, the, max, planck, sustainability, network, and, national, platforms, such, as, green, labs, austria, and, green, labs, nl, more, university, independent, efforts, and, resources, include, the, laboratory, efficiency, assessment, framework, the, think, tank, labos1point5, and, the, non, profit, organisation, my, green, lab, organization, of, laboratories, is, an, area, of, focus, in, sociology, scientists, consider, how, their, work, should, be, organized, which, could, be, based, on, themes, teams, projects, or, fields, of, expertise, work, is, divided, not, only, between, different, jobs, of, the, laboratory, such, as, the, researchers, engineers, and, technicians, but, also, in, terms, of, autonomy, should, the, work, be, individual, or, in, groups, for, example, one, research, group, has, a, schedule, where, they, conduct, research, on, their, own, topic, of, interest, for, one, day, of, the, week, but, for, the, rest, they, work, on, a, given, group, project, finance, management, is, yet, another, organizational, issue, the, laboratory, itself, is, a, historically, dated, organizational, model, it, came, about, due, to, the, observation, that, the, quality, of, work, of, researchers, who, collaborate, is, overall, greater, than, a, researcher, working, in, isolation, from, the, 1950s, the, laboratory, has, evolved, from, being, an, educational, tool, used, by, teachers, to, attract, the, top, students, into, research, into, an, organizational, model, allowing, a, high, level, of, scientific, productivity, some, forms, of, organization, in, laboratories, include, there, are, three, main, factors, that, contribute, to, the, organizational, form, of, a, laboratory, other, forms, of, organization, include, social, organization, a, study, by, richard, h, r, harper, involving, two, laboratories, will, help, elucidate, the, concept, of, social, organization, in, laboratories, the, main, subject, of, the, study, revolved, around, the, relationship, between, the, staff, of, a, laboratory, researchers, administrators, receptionists, technicians, etc, and, their, locator, a, locator, is, an, employee, of, a, laboratory, who, is, in, charge, of, knowing, where, each, member, of, the, laboratory, currently, is, based, on, a, unique, signal, emitted, from, the, badge, of, each, staff, member, the, study, describes, social, relationships, among, different, classes, of, jobs, such, as, the, relationship, between, researchers, and, the, locator, it, does, not, describe, the, social, relationship, between, employees, within, a, class, such, as, the, relationship, between, researchers, through, ethnographic, studies, one, finding, is, that, among, the, personnel, each, class, researchers, administrators, has, a, different, degree, of, entitlement, which, varies, per, laboratory, entitlement, can, be, both, formal, or, informal, meaning, it, is, not, enforced, but, each, class, is, aware, and, conforms, to, its, existence, the, degree, of, entitlement, which, is, also, referred, to, as, a, staff, s, rights, affects, social, interaction, between, staff, by, looking, at, the, various, interactions, among, staff, members, we, can, determine, their, social, position, in, the, organization, as, an, example, administrators, in, one, lab, of, the, study, do, not, have, the, right, to, ask, the, locator, where, the, researchers, currently, are, as, they, are, not, entitled, to, such, information, on, the, other, hand, researchers, do, have, access, to, this, type, of, information, so, a, consequence, of, this, social, hierarchy, is, that, the, locator, discloses, various, degrees, of, information, based, on, the, staff, member, and, their, rights, the, locator, does, not, want, to, disclose, information, that, could, jeopardize, his, relationship, with, the, members, of, staff, the, locator, adheres, to, the, rights, of, each, class, social, hierarchy, is, also, related, to, attitudes, towards, technologies, this, was, inferred, based, on, the, attitude, of, various, jobs, towards, their, lab, badge, their, attitude, depended, on, how, that, job, viewed, their, badge, from, a, standpoint, of, utility, how, is, the, badge, useful, for, my, job, morality, what, are, my, morals, on, privacy, as, it, relates, to, being, tracked, by, this, badge, and, relations, how, will, i, be, seen, by, others, if, i, refuse, to, wear, this, badge, for, example, a, receptionist, would, view, the, badge, as, useful, as, it, would, help, them, locate, members, of, staff, during, the, day, illustrating, relations, researchers, would, also, wear, their, badge, due, to, informal, pressures, such, as, not, wanting, to, look, like, a, spoil, sport, or, not, wanting, to, draw, attention, to, themselves, another, finding, is, the, resistance, to, change, in, a, social, organization, staff, members, feel, ill, at, ease, when, changing, patterns, of, entitlement, obligation, respect, informal, and, formal, hierarchy, and, more, in, summary, differences, in, attitude, among, members, of, the, laboratory, are, explained, by, social, organization, a, person, s, attitudes, are, intimately, related, to, the, role, they, have, in, an, organization, this, hierarchy, helps, understand, information, distribution, control, and, attitudes, towards, technologies, in, the, laboratory
