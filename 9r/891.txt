evaporation, is, a, type, of, vaporization, that, occurs, on, the, surface, of, a, liquid, as, it, changes, into, the, gas, phase, a, high, concentration, of, the, evaporating, substance, in, the, surrounding, gas, significantly, slows, down, evaporation, such, as, when, humidity, affects, rate, of, evaporation, of, water, when, the, molecules, of, the, liquid, collide, they, transfer, energy, to, each, other, based, on, how, they, collide, when, a, molecule, near, the, surface, absorbs, enough, energy, to, overcome, the, vapor, pressure, it, will, escape, and, enter, the, surrounding, air, as, a, gas, when, evaporation, occurs, the, energy, removed, from, the, vaporized, liquid, will, reduce, the, temperature, of, the, liquid, resulting, in, evaporative, cooling, on, average, only, a, fraction, of, the, molecules, in, a, liquid, have, enough, heat, energy, to, escape, from, the, liquid, the, evaporation, will, continue, until, an, equilibrium, is, reached, when, the, evaporation, of, the, liquid, is, equal, to, its, condensation, in, an, enclosed, environment, a, liquid, will, evaporate, until, the, surrounding, air, is, saturated, evaporation, is, an, essential, part, of, the, water, cycle, the, sun, solar, energy, drives, evaporation, of, water, from, oceans, lakes, moisture, in, the, soil, and, other, sources, of, water, in, hydrology, evaporation, and, transpiration, which, involves, evaporation, within, plant, stomata, are, collectively, termed, evapotranspiration, evaporation, of, water, occurs, when, the, surface, of, the, liquid, is, exposed, allowing, molecules, to, escape, and, form, water, vapor, this, vapor, can, then, rise, up, and, form, clouds, with, sufficient, energy, the, liquid, will, turn, into, vapor, for, molecules, of, a, liquid, to, evaporate, they, must, be, located, near, the, surface, they, have, to, be, moving, in, the, proper, direction, and, have, sufficient, kinetic, energy, to, overcome, liquid, phase, intermolecular, forces, when, only, a, small, proportion, of, the, molecules, meet, these, criteria, the, rate, of, evaporation, is, low, since, the, kinetic, energy, of, a, molecule, is, proportional, to, its, temperature, evaporation, proceeds, more, quickly, at, higher, temperatures, as, the, faster, moving, molecules, escape, the, remaining, molecules, have, lower, average, kinetic, energy, and, the, temperature, of, the, liquid, decreases, this, phenomenon, is, also, called, evaporative, cooling, this, is, why, evaporating, sweat, cools, the, human, body, evaporation, also, tends, to, proceed, more, quickly, with, higher, flow, rates, between, the, gaseous, and, liquid, phase, and, in, liquids, with, higher, vapor, pressure, for, example, laundry, on, a, clothes, line, will, dry, by, evaporation, more, rapidly, on, a, windy, day, than, on, a, still, day, three, key, parts, to, evaporation, are, heat, atmospheric, pressure, determines, the, percent, humidity, and, air, movement, on, a, molecular, level, there, is, no, strict, boundary, between, the, liquid, state, and, the, vapor, state, instead, there, is, a, knudsen, layer, where, the, phase, is, undetermined, because, this, layer, is, only, a, few, molecules, thick, at, a, macroscopic, scale, a, clear, phase, transition, interface, cannot, be, seen, liquids, that, do, not, evaporate, visibly, at, a, given, temperature, in, a, given, gas, e, g, cooking, oil, at, room, temperature, have, molecules, that, do, not, tend, to, transfer, energy, to, each, other, in, a, pattern, sufficient, to, frequently, give, a, molecule, the, heat, energy, necessary, to, turn, into, vapor, however, these, liquids, are, evaporating, it, is, just, that, the, process, is, much, slower, and, thus, significantly, less, visible, if, evaporation, takes, place, in, an, enclosed, area, the, escaping, molecules, accumulate, as, a, vapor, above, the, liquid, many, of, the, molecules, return, to, the, liquid, with, returning, molecules, becoming, more, frequent, as, the, density, and, pressure, of, the, vapor, increases, when, the, process, of, escape, and, return, reaches, an, equilibrium, the, vapor, is, said, to, be, saturated, and, no, further, change, in, either, vapor, pressure, and, density, or, liquid, temperature, will, occur, for, a, system, consisting, of, vapor, and, liquid, of, a, pure, substance, this, equilibrium, state, is, directly, related, to, the, vapor, pressure, of, the, substance, as, given, by, the, clausius, clapeyron, relation, where, p, 1, p, 2, are, the, vapor, pressures, at, temperatures, t, 1, t, 2, respectively, h, vap, is, the, enthalpy, of, vaporization, and, r, is, the, universal, gas, constant, the, rate, of, evaporation, in, an, open, system, is, related, to, the, vapor, pressure, found, in, a, closed, system, if, a, liquid, is, heated, when, the, vapor, pressure, reaches, the, ambient, pressure, the, liquid, will, boil, the, ability, for, a, molecule, of, a, liquid, to, evaporate, is, based, largely, on, the, amount, of, kinetic, energy, an, individual, particle, may, possess, even, at, lower, temperatures, individual, molecules, of, a, liquid, can, evaporate, if, they, have, more, than, the, minimum, amount, of, kinetic, energy, required, for, vaporization, note, air, is, used, here, as, a, common, example, of, the, surrounding, gas, however, other, gases, may, hold, that, role, in, the, us, the, national, weather, service, measures, at, various, outdoor, locations, nationwide, the, actual, rate, of, evaporation, from, a, standardized, pan, open, water, surface, others, do, likewise, around, the, world, the, us, data, is, collected, and, compiled, into, an, annual, evaporation, map, the, measurements, range, from, under, 30, to, over, 120, inches, 3, 000, mm, per, year, because, it, typically, takes, place, in, a, complex, environment, where, evaporation, is, an, extremely, rare, event, the, mechanism, for, the, evaporation, of, water, is, not, completely, understood, theoretical, calculations, require, prohibitively, long, and, large, computer, simulations, the, rate, of, evaporation, of, liquid, water, is, one, of, the, principal, uncertainties, in, modern, climate, modeling, evaporation, is, an, endothermic, process, since, heat, is, absorbed, during, evaporation, fuel, droplets, vaporize, as, they, receive, heat, by, mixing, with, the, hot, gases, in, the, combustion, chamber, heat, energy, can, also, be, received, by, radiation, from, any, hot, refractory, wall, of, the, combustion, chamber, internal, combustion, engines, rely, upon, the, vaporization, of, the, fuel, in, the, cylinders, to, form, a, fuel, air, mixture, in, order, to, burn, well, the, chemically, correct, air, fuel, mixture, for, total, burning, of, gasoline, has, been, determined, to, be, 15, parts, air, to, one, part, gasoline, or, 15, 1, by, weight, changing, this, to, a, volume, ratio, yields, 8000, parts, air, to, one, part, gasoline, or, 8, 000, 1, by, volume, thin, films, may, be, deposited, by, evaporating, a, substance, and, condensing, it, onto, a, substrate, or, by, dissolving, the, substance, in, a, solvent, spreading, the, resulting, solution, thinly, over, a, substrate, and, evaporating, the, solvent, the, hertz, knudsen, equation, is, often, used, to, estimate, the, rate, of, evaporation, in, these, instances, media, related, to, evaporation, at, wikimedia, commons
