in, glaciology, an, ice, sheet, also, known, as, a, continental, glacier, is, a, mass, of, glacial, ice, that, covers, surrounding, terrain, and, is, greater, than, 50, 000, km, 2, 19, 000, sq, mi, the, only, current, ice, sheets, are, the, antarctic, ice, sheet, and, the, greenland, ice, sheet, ice, sheets, are, bigger, than, ice, shelves, or, alpine, glaciers, masses, of, ice, covering, less, than, 50, 000, km, 2, are, termed, an, ice, cap, an, ice, cap, will, typically, feed, a, series, of, glaciers, around, its, periphery, although, the, surface, is, cold, the, base, of, an, ice, sheet, is, generally, warmer, due, to, geothermal, heat, in, places, melting, occurs, and, the, melt, water, lubricates, the, ice, sheet, so, that, it, flows, more, rapidly, this, process, produces, fast, flowing, channels, in, the, ice, sheet, these, are, ice, streams, even, stable, ice, sheets, are, continually, in, motion, as, the, ice, gradually, flows, outward, from, the, central, plateau, which, is, the, tallest, point, of, the, ice, sheet, and, towards, the, margins, the, ice, sheet, slope, is, low, around, the, plateau, but, increases, steeply, at, the, margins, increasing, global, air, temperatures, due, to, climate, change, take, around, 10, 000, years, to, directly, propagate, through, the, ice, before, they, influence, bed, temperatures, but, may, have, an, effect, through, increased, surface, melting, producing, more, supraglacial, lakes, these, lakes, may, feed, warm, water, to, glacial, bases, and, facilitate, glacial, motion, in, previous, geologic, time, spans, glacial, periods, there, were, other, ice, sheets, during, the, last, glacial, period, at, last, glacial, maximum, the, laurentide, ice, sheet, covered, much, of, north, america, in, the, same, period, the, weichselian, ice, sheet, covered, northern, europe, and, the, patagonian, ice, sheet, covered, southern, south, america, an, ice, sheet, is, a, body, of, ice, which, covers, a, land, area, of, continental, size, meaning, that, it, exceeds, 50, 000, km, 2, the, currently, existing, two, ice, sheets, in, greenland, and, antarctica, have, a, much, greater, area, than, this, minimum, definition, measuring, at, 1, 7, million, km, 2, and, 14, million, km, 2, respectively, both, ice, sheets, are, also, very, thick, as, they, consist, of, a, continuous, ice, layer, with, an, average, thickness, of, 2, km, 1, mi, this, ice, layer, forms, because, most, of, the, snow, which, falls, onto, the, ice, sheet, never, melts, and, is, instead, compressed, by, the, mass, of, newer, snow, layers, this, process, of, ice, sheet, growth, is, still, occurring, nowadays, as, can, be, clearly, seen, in, an, example, that, occurred, in, world, war, ii, a, lockheed, p, 38, lightning, fighter, plane, crashed, in, greenland, in, 1942, it, was, only, recovered, 50, years, later, by, then, it, had, been, buried, under, 81, m, 268, feet, of, ice, which, had, formed, over, that, time, period, even, stable, ice, sheets, are, continually, in, motion, as, the, ice, gradually, flows, outward, from, the, central, plateau, which, is, the, tallest, point, of, the, ice, sheet, and, towards, the, margins, the, ice, sheet, slope, is, low, around, the, plateau, but, increases, steeply, at, the, margins, this, difference, in, slope, occurs, due, to, an, imbalance, between, high, ice, accumulation, in, the, central, plateau, and, lower, accumulation, as, well, as, higher, ablation, at, the, margins, this, imbalance, increases, the, shear, stress, on, a, glacier, until, it, begins, to, flow, the, flow, velocity, and, deformation, will, increase, as, the, equilibrium, line, between, these, two, processes, is, approached, this, motion, is, driven, by, gravity, but, is, controlled, by, temperature, and, the, strength, of, individual, glacier, bases, a, number, of, processes, alter, these, two, factors, resulting, in, cyclic, surges, of, activity, interspersed, with, longer, periods, of, inactivity, on, time, scales, ranging, from, hourly, i, e, tidal, flows, to, the, centennial, milankovich, cycles, on, an, unrelated, hour, to, hour, basis, surges, of, ice, motion, can, be, modulated, by, tidal, activity, the, influence, of, a, 1, m, tidal, oscillation, can, be, felt, as, much, as, 100, km, from, the, sea, during, larger, spring, tides, an, ice, stream, will, remain, almost, stationary, for, hours, at, a, time, before, a, surge, of, around, a, foot, in, under, an, hour, just, after, the, peak, high, tide, a, stationary, period, then, takes, hold, until, another, surge, towards, the, middle, or, end, of, the, falling, tide, at, neap, tides, this, interaction, is, less, pronounced, and, surges, instead, occur, approximately, every, 12, hours, increasing, global, air, temperatures, due, to, climate, change, take, around, 10, 000, years, to, directly, propagate, through, the, ice, before, they, influence, bed, temperatures, but, may, have, an, effect, through, increased, surface, melting, producing, more, supraglacial, lakes, these, lakes, may, feed, warm, water, to, glacial, bases, and, facilitate, glacial, motion, lakes, of, a, diameter, greater, than, 300, m, are, capable, of, creating, a, fluid, filled, crevasse, to, the, glacier, bed, interface, when, these, crevasses, form, the, entirety, of, the, lake, s, relatively, warm, contents, can, reach, the, base, of, the, glacier, in, as, little, as, 2, 18, hours, lubricating, the, bed, and, causing, the, glacier, to, surge, water, that, reaches, the, bed, of, a, glacier, may, freeze, there, increasing, the, thickness, of, the, glacier, by, pushing, it, up, from, below, as, the, margins, end, at, the, marine, boundary, excess, ice, is, discharged, through, ice, streams, or, outlet, glaciers, then, it, either, falls, directly, into, the, sea, or, is, accumulated, atop, the, floating, ice, shelves, 2234, those, ice, shelves, then, calve, icebergs, at, their, periphery, if, they, experience, excess, of, ice, ice, shelves, would, also, experience, accelerated, calving, due, to, basal, melting, in, antarctica, this, is, driven, by, heat, fed, to, the, shelf, by, the, circumpolar, deep, water, current, which, is, 3, c, above, the, ice, s, melting, point, the, presence, of, ice, shelves, has, a, stabilizing, influence, on, the, glacier, behind, them, while, an, absence, of, an, ice, shelf, becomes, destabilizing, for, instance, when, larsen, b, ice, shelf, in, the, antarctic, peninsula, had, collapsed, over, three, weeks, in, february, 2002, the, four, glaciers, behind, it, crane, glacier, green, glacier, hektoria, glacier, and, jorum, glacier, all, started, to, flow, at, a, much, faster, rate, while, the, two, glaciers, flask, and, leppard, stabilized, by, the, remnants, of, the, ice, shelf, did, not, accelerate, the, collapse, of, the, larsen, b, shelf, was, preceded, by, thinning, of, just, 1, metre, per, year, while, some, other, antarctic, ice, shelves, have, displayed, thinning, of, tens, of, metres, per, year, further, increased, ocean, temperatures, of, 1, c, may, lead, to, up, to, 10, metres, per, year, of, basal, melting, ice, shelves, are, always, stable, under, mean, annual, temperatures, of, 9, c, but, never, stable, above, 5, c, this, places, regional, warming, of, 1, 5, c, as, preceded, the, collapse, of, larsen, b, in, context, in, the, 1970s, johannes, weertman, proposed, that, because, seawater, is, denser, than, ice, then, any, ice, sheets, grounded, below, sea, level, inherently, become, less, stable, as, they, melt, due, to, archimedes, principle, effectively, these, marine, ice, sheets, must, have, enough, mass, to, exceed, the, mass, of, the, seawater, displaced, by, the, ice, which, requires, excess, thickness, as, the, ice, sheet, melts, and, becomes, thinner, the, weight, of, the, overlying, ice, decreases, at, a, certain, point, sea, water, could, force, itself, into, the, gaps, which, form, at, the, base, of, the, ice, sheet, and, marine, ice, sheet, instability, misi, would, occur, even, if, the, ice, sheet, is, grounded, below, the, sea, level, misi, cannot, occur, as, long, as, there, is, a, stable, ice, shelf, in, front, of, it, the, boundary, between, the, ice, sheet, and, the, ice, shelf, known, as, the, grounding, line, is, particularly, stable, if, it, is, constrained, in, an, embayment, in, that, case, the, ice, sheet, may, not, be, thinning, at, all, as, the, amount, of, ice, flowing, over, the, grounding, line, would, be, likely, to, match, the, annual, accumulation, of, ice, from, snow, upstream, otherwise, ocean, warming, at, the, base, of, an, ice, shelf, tends, to, thin, it, through, basal, melting, as, the, ice, shelf, becomes, thinner, it, exerts, less, of, a, buttressing, effect, on, the, ice, sheet, the, so, called, back, stress, increases, and, the, grounding, line, is, pushed, backwards, the, ice, sheet, is, likely, to, start, losing, more, ice, from, the, new, location, of, the, grounding, line, and, so, become, lighter, and, less, capable, of, displacing, seawater, this, eventually, pushes, the, grounding, line, back, even, further, creating, a, self, reinforcing, mechanism, because, the, entire, west, antarctic, ice, sheet, is, grounded, below, the, sea, level, it, would, be, vulnerable, to, geologically, rapid, ice, loss, in, this, scenario, in, particular, the, thwaites, and, pine, island, glaciers, are, most, likely, to, be, prone, to, misi, and, both, glaciers, have, been, rapidly, thinning, and, accelerating, in, recent, decades, as, the, result, sea, level, rise, from, the, ice, sheet, could, be, accelerated, by, tens, of, centimeters, within, the, 21st, century, alone, the, majority, of, the, east, antarctic, ice, sheet, would, not, be, affected, totten, glacier, is, the, largest, glacier, there, which, is, known, to, be, subject, to, misi, yet, its, potential, contribution, to, sea, level, rise, is, comparable, to, that, of, the, entire, west, antarctic, ice, sheet, totten, glacier, has, been, losing, mass, nearly, monotonically, in, recent, decades, suggesting, rapid, retreat, is, possible, in, the, near, future, although, the, dynamic, behavior, of, totten, ice, shelf, is, known, to, vary, on, seasonal, to, interannual, timescales, the, wilkes, basin, is, the, only, major, submarine, basin, in, antarctica, that, is, not, thought, to, be, sensitive, to, warming, ultimately, even, geologically, rapid, sea, level, rise, would, still, most, likely, require, several, millennia, for, the, entirety, of, these, ice, masses, wais, and, the, subglacial, basins, to, be, lost, a, related, process, known, as, marine, ice, cliff, instability, mici, posits, that, ice, cliffs, which, exceed, 90, m, 295, 1, 2, ft, in, above, ground, height, and, are, 800, m, 2, 624, 1, 2, ft, in, basal, underground, height, are, likely, to, collapse, under, their, own, weight, once, the, peripheral, ice, stabilizing, them, is, gone, their, collapse, then, exposes, the, ice, masses, following, them, to, the, same, instability, potentially, resulting, in, a, self, sustaining, cycle, of, cliff, collapse, and, rapid, ice, sheet, retreat, i, e, sea, level, rise, of, a, meter, or, more, by, 2100, from, antarctica, alone, this, theory, had, been, highly, influential, in, a, 2020, survey, of, 106, experts, the, paper, which, had, advanced, this, theory, was, considered, more, important, than, even, the, year, 2014, ipcc, fifth, assessment, report, sea, level, rise, projections, which, involve, mici, are, much, larger, than, the, others, particularly, under, high, warming, rate, at, the, same, time, this, theory, has, also, been, highly, controversial, it, was, originally, proposed, in, order, to, describe, how, the, large, sea, level, rise, during, the, pliocene, and, the, last, interglacial, could, have, occurred, yet, more, recent, research, found, that, these, sea, level, rise, episodes, can, be, explained, without, any, ice, cliff, instability, taking, place, research, in, pine, island, bay, in, west, antarctica, the, location, of, thwaites, and, pine, island, glacier, had, found, seabed, gouging, by, ice, from, the, younger, dryas, period, which, appears, consistent, with, mici, however, it, indicates, relatively, rapid, yet, still, prolonged, ice, sheet, retreat, with, a, movement, of, 200, km, 120, mi, inland, taking, place, over, an, estimated, 1100, years, from, 12, 300, years, before, present, to, 11, 200, b, p, in, recent, years, 2002, 2004, fast, retreat, of, crane, glacier, immediately, after, the, collapse, of, the, larsen, b, ice, shelf, before, it, reached, a, shallow, fjord, and, stabilized, could, have, involved, mici, but, there, weren, t, enough, observations, to, confirm, or, refute, this, theory, the, retreat, of, greenland, ice, sheet, s, three, largest, glaciers, jakobshavn, helheim, and, kangerdlugssuaq, glacier, did, not, resemble, predictions, from, ice, cliff, collapse, at, least, up, until, the, end, of, 2013, but, an, event, observed, at, helheim, glacier, in, august, 2014, may, fit, the, definition, further, modelling, done, after, the, initial, hypothesis, indicates, that, ice, cliff, instability, would, require, implausibly, fast, ice, shelf, collapse, i, e, within, an, hour, for, 90, m, 295, 1, 2, ft, tall, cliffs, unless, the, ice, had, already, been, substantially, damaged, beforehand, further, ice, cliff, breakdown, would, produce, a, large, number, of, debris, in, the, coastal, waters, known, as, ice, m, lange, and, multiple, studies, indicate, their, build, up, would, slow, or, even, outright, stop, the, instability, soon, after, it, started, some, scientists, including, the, originators, of, the, hypothesis, robert, deconto, and, david, pollard, have, suggested, that, the, best, way, to, resolve, the, question, would, be, to, precisely, determine, sea, level, rise, during, the, last, interglacial, mici, can, be, effectively, ruled, out, if, slr, at, the, time, was, lower, than, 4, m, 13, ft, while, it, is, very, likely, if, the, slr, was, greater, than, 6, m, 19, 1, 2, ft, as, of, 2023, the, most, recent, analysis, indicates, that, the, last, interglacial, slr, is, unlikely, to, have, been, higher, than, 2, 7, m, 9, ft, as, higher, values, in, other, research, such, as, 5, 7, m, 18, 1, 2, ft, appear, inconsistent, with, the, new, paleoclimate, data, from, the, bahamas, and, the, known, history, of, the, greenland, ice, sheet, the, west, antarctic, ice, sheet, wais, is, the, segment, of, the, continental, ice, sheet, that, covers, west, antarctica, the, portion, of, antarctica, on, the, side, of, the, transantarctic, mountains, that, lies, in, the, western, hemisphere, it, is, classified, as, a, marine, based, ice, sheet, meaning, that, its, bed, lies, well, below, sea, level, and, its, edges, flow, into, floating, ice, shelves, the, wais, is, bounded, by, the, ross, ice, shelf, the, ronne, ice, shelf, and, outlet, glaciers, that, drain, into, the, amundsen, sea, as, a, smaller, part, of, antarctica, wais, is, also, more, strongly, affected, by, climate, change, there, has, been, warming, over, the, ice, sheet, since, the, 1950s, and, a, substantial, retreat, of, its, coastal, glaciers, since, at, least, the, 1990s, estimates, suggest, it, added, around, 7, 6, 3, 9, mm, 19, 64, 5, 32, in, to, the, global, sea, level, rise, between, 1992, and, 2017, and, has, been, losing, ice, in, the, 2010s, at, a, rate, equivalent, to, 0, 4, millimetres, 0, 016, inches, of, annual, sea, level, rise, while, some, of, its, losses, are, offset, by, the, growth, of, the, east, antarctic, ice, sheet, antarctica, as, a, whole, will, most, likely, lose, enough, ice, by, 2100, to, add, 11, cm, 4, 3, in, to, sea, levels, further, marine, ice, sheet, instability, may, increase, this, amount, by, tens, of, centimeters, particularly, under, high, warming, fresh, meltwater, from, wais, also, contributes, to, ocean, stratification, and, dilutes, the, formation, of, salty, antarctic, bottom, water, which, destabilizes, southern, ocean, overturning, circulation, in, the, long, term, the, west, antarctic, ice, sheet, is, likely, to, disappear, due, to, the, warming, which, has, already, occurred, paleoclimate, evidence, suggests, that, this, has, already, happened, during, the, eemian, period, when, the, global, temperatures, were, similar, to, the, early, 21st, century, it, is, believed, that, the, loss, of, the, ice, sheet, would, take, place, between, 2, 000, and, 13, 000, years, in, the, future, although, several, centuries, of, high, emissions, may, shorten, this, to, 500, years, 3, 3, m, 10, ft, 10, in, of, sea, level, rise, would, occur, if, the, ice, sheet, collapses, but, leaves, ice, caps, on, the, mountains, behind, total, sea, level, rise, from, west, antarctica, increases, to, 4, 3, m, 14, ft, 1, in, if, they, melt, as, well, but, this, would, require, a, higher, level, of, warming, isostatic, rebound, of, ice, free, land, may, also, add, around, 1, m, 3, ft, 3, in, to, the, global, sea, levels, over, another, 1, 000, years, the, east, antarctic, ice, sheet, eais, lies, between, 45, west, and, 168, east, longitudinally, it, was, first, formed, around, 34, million, years, ago, and, it, is, the, largest, ice, sheet, on, the, entire, planet, with, far, greater, volume, than, the, greenland, ice, sheet, or, the, west, antarctic, ice, sheet, wais, from, which, it, is, separated, by, the, transantarctic, mountains, the, ice, sheet, is, around, 2, 2, km, 1, 4, mi, thick, on, average, and, is, 4, 897, m, 16, 066, ft, at, its, thickest, point, it, is, also, home, to, the, geographic, south, pole, south, magnetic, pole, and, the, amundsen, scott, south, pole, station, the, surface, of, the, eais, is, the, driest, windiest, and, coldest, place, on, earth, lack, of, moisture, in, the, air, high, albedo, from, the, snow, as, well, as, the, surface, s, consistently, high, elevation, results, in, the, reported, cold, temperature, records, of, nearly, 100, c, 148, f, it, is, the, only, place, on, earth, cold, enough, for, atmospheric, temperature, inversion, to, occur, consistently, that, is, while, the, atmosphere, is, typically, warmest, near, the, surface, and, becomes, cooler, at, greater, elevation, atmosphere, during, the, antarctic, winter, is, cooler, at, the, surface, than, in, its, middle, layers, consequently, greenhouse, gases, actually, trap, heat, in, the, middle, atmosphere, and, reduce, its, flow, towards, the, surface, while, the, temperature, inversion, lasts, due, to, these, factors, east, antarctica, had, experienced, slight, cooling, for, decades, while, the, rest, of, the, world, warmed, as, the, result, of, climate, change, clear, warming, over, east, antarctica, only, started, to, occur, since, the, year, 2000, and, was, not, conclusively, detected, until, the, 2020s, in, the, early, 2000s, cooling, over, east, antarctica, seemingly, outweighing, warming, over, the, rest, of, the, continent, was, frequently, misinterpreted, by, the, media, and, occasionally, used, as, an, argument, for, climate, change, denial, after, 2009, improvements, in, antarctica, s, instrumental, temperature, record, have, proven, that, the, warming, over, west, antarctica, resulted, in, consistent, net, warming, across, the, continent, since, the, 1957, the, greenland, ice, sheet, is, an, ice, sheet, which, forms, the, second, largest, body, of, ice, in, the, world, it, is, an, average, of, 1, 67, km, 1, 0, mi, thick, and, over, 3, km, 1, 9, mi, thick, at, its, maximum, it, is, almost, 2, 900, kilometres, 1, 800, mi, long, in, a, north, south, direction, with, a, maximum, width, of, 1, 100, kilometres, 680, mi, at, a, latitude, of, 77, n, near, its, northern, edge, the, ice, sheet, covers, 1, 710, 000, square, kilometres, 660, 000, sq, mi, around, 80, of, the, surface, of, greenland, or, about, 12, of, the, area, of, the, antarctic, ice, sheet, the, term, greenland, ice, sheet, is, often, shortened, to, gis, or, gris, in, scientific, literature, greenland, has, had, major, glaciers, and, ice, caps, for, at, least, 18, million, years, but, a, single, ice, sheet, first, covered, most, of, the, island, some, 2, 6, million, years, ago, since, then, it, has, both, grown, and, contracted, significantly, the, oldest, known, ice, on, greenland, is, about, 1, million, years, old, due, to, anthropogenic, greenhouse, gas, emissions, the, ice, sheet, is, now, the, warmest, it, has, been, in, the, past, 1000, years, and, is, losing, ice, at, the, fastest, rate, in, at, least, the, past, 12, 000, years, every, summer, parts, of, the, surface, melt, and, ice, cliffs, calve, into, the, sea, normally, the, ice, sheet, would, be, replenished, by, winter, snowfall, but, due, to, global, warming, the, ice, sheet, is, melting, two, to, five, times, faster, than, before, 1850, and, snowfall, has, not, kept, up, since, 1996, if, the, paris, agreement, goal, of, staying, below, 2, c, 3, 6, f, is, achieved, melting, of, greenland, ice, alone, would, still, add, around, 6, cm, 2, 1, 2, in, to, global, sea, level, rise, by, the, end, of, the, century, if, there, are, no, reductions, in, emissions, melting, would, add, around, 13, cm, 5, in, by, 2100, 1302, with, a, worst, case, of, about, 33, cm, 13, in, for, comparison, melting, has, so, far, contributed, 1, 4, cm, 1, 2, in, since, 1972, while, sea, level, rise, from, all, sources, was, 15, 25, cm, 6, 10, in, between, 1901, and, 2018, 5, historically, ice, sheets, were, viewed, as, inert, components, of, the, carbon, cycle, and, were, largely, disregarded, in, global, models, in, 2010s, research, had, demonstrated, the, existence, of, uniquely, adapted, microbial, communities, high, rates, of, biogeochemical, and, physical, weathering, in, ice, sheets, and, storage, and, cycling, of, organic, carbon, in, excess, of, 100, billion, tonnes, there, is, a, massive, contrast, in, carbon, storage, between, the, two, ice, sheets, while, only, about, 0, 5, 27, billion, tonnes, of, pure, carbon, are, present, underneath, the, greenland, ice, sheet, 6000, 21, 000, billion, tonnes, of, pure, carbon, are, thought, to, be, located, underneath, antarctica, this, carbon, can, act, as, a, climate, change, feedback, if, it, is, gradually, released, through, meltwater, thus, increasing, overall, carbon, dioxide, emissions, for, comparison, 1400, 1650, billion, tonnes, are, contained, within, the, arctic, permafrost, also, for, comparison, the, annual, human, caused, carbon, dioxide, emissions, amount, to, around, 40, billion, tonnes, of, co, 2, 1237, in, greenland, there, is, one, known, area, at, russell, glacier, where, meltwater, carbon, is, released, into, the, atmosphere, as, methane, which, has, a, much, larger, global, warming, potential, than, carbon, dioxide, however, it, also, harbours, large, numbers, of, methanotrophic, bacteria, which, limit, those, emissions, normally, the, transitions, between, glacial, and, interglacial, states, are, governed, by, milankovitch, cycles, which, are, patterns, in, insolation, the, amount, of, sunlight, reaching, the, earth, these, patterns, are, caused, by, the, variations, in, shape, of, the, earth, s, orbit, and, its, angle, relative, to, the, sun, caused, by, the, gravitational, pull, of, other, planets, as, they, go, through, their, own, orbits, for, instance, during, at, least, the, last, 100, 000, years, portions, of, the, ice, sheet, covering, much, of, north, america, the, laurentide, ice, sheet, broke, apart, sending, large, flotillas, of, icebergs, into, the, north, atlantic, when, these, icebergs, melted, they, dropped, the, boulders, and, other, continental, rocks, they, carried, leaving, layers, known, as, ice, rafted, debris, these, so, called, heinrich, events, named, after, their, discoverer, hartmut, heinrich, appear, to, have, a, 7, 000, 10, 000, year, periodicity, and, occur, during, cold, periods, within, the, last, interglacial, internal, ice, sheet, binge, purge, cycles, may, be, responsible, for, the, observed, effects, where, the, ice, builds, to, unstable, levels, then, a, portion, of, the, ice, sheet, collapses, external, factors, might, also, play, a, role, in, forcing, ice, sheets, dansgaard, oeschger, events, are, abrupt, warmings, of, the, northern, hemisphere, occurring, over, the, space, of, perhaps, 40, years, while, these, d, o, events, occur, directly, after, each, heinrich, event, they, also, occur, more, frequently, around, every, 1500, years, from, this, evidence, paleoclimatologists, surmise, that, the, same, forcings, may, drive, both, heinrich, and, d, o, events, hemispheric, asynchrony, in, ice, sheet, behavior, has, been, observed, by, linking, short, term, spikes, of, methane, in, greenland, ice, cores, and, antarctic, ice, cores, during, dansgaard, oeschger, events, the, northern, hemisphere, warmed, considerably, dramatically, increasing, the, release, of, methane, from, wetlands, that, were, otherwise, tundra, during, glacial, times, this, methane, quickly, distributes, evenly, across, the, globe, becoming, incorporated, in, antarctic, and, greenland, ice, with, this, tie, paleoclimatologists, have, been, able, to, say, that, the, ice, sheets, on, greenland, only, began, to, warm, after, the, antarctic, ice, sheet, had, been, warming, for, several, thousand, years, why, this, pattern, occurs, is, still, open, for, debate, the, icing, of, antarctica, began, in, the, late, palaeocene, or, middle, eocene, between, 60, and, 45, 5, million, years, ago, and, escalated, during, the, eocene, oligocene, extinction, event, about, 34, million, years, ago, co, 2, levels, were, then, about, 760, ppm, and, had, been, decreasing, from, earlier, levels, in, the, thousands, of, ppm, carbon, dioxide, decrease, with, a, tipping, point, of, 600, ppm, was, the, primary, agent, forcing, antarctic, glaciation, the, glaciation, was, favored, by, an, interval, when, the, earth, s, orbit, favored, cool, summers, but, oxygen, isotope, ratio, cycle, marker, changes, were, too, large, to, be, explained, by, antarctic, ice, sheet, growth, alone, indicating, an, ice, age, of, some, size, the, opening, of, the, drake, passage, may, have, played, a, role, as, well, though, models, of, the, changes, suggest, declining, co, 2, levels, to, have, been, more, important, while, there, is, evidence, of, large, glaciers, in, greenland, for, most, of, the, past, 18, million, years, these, ice, bodies, were, probably, similar, to, various, smaller, modern, examples, such, as, maniitsoq, and, flade, isblink, which, cover, 76, 000, and, 100, 000, square, kilometres, 29, 000, and, 39, 000, sq, mi, around, the, periphery, conditions, in, greenland, were, not, initially, suitable, for, a, single, coherent, ice, sheet, to, develop, but, this, began, to, change, around, 10, million, years, ago, during, the, middle, miocene, when, the, two, passive, continental, margins, which, now, form, the, uplands, of, west, and, east, greenland, experienced, uplift, and, ultimately, formed, the, upper, planation, surface, at, a, height, of, 2000, to, 3000, meter, above, sea, level
