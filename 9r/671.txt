the, great, oxidation, event, goe, or, great, oxygenation, event, also, called, the, oxygen, catastrophe, oxygen, revolution, oxygen, crisis, or, oxygen, holocaust, was, a, time, interval, during, the, earth, s, paleoproterozoic, era, when, the, earth, s, atmosphere, and, shallow, seas, first, experienced, a, rise, in, the, concentration, of, free, oxygen, this, began, approximately, 2, 460, 2, 426, ga, billion, years, ago, during, the, siderian, period, and, ended, approximately, 2, 060, ga, ago, during, the, rhyacian, geological, isotopic, and, chemical, evidence, suggests, that, biologically, produced, molecular, oxygen, dioxygen, or, o, 2, started, to, accumulate, in, the, archean, prebiotic, atmosphere, due, to, microbial, photosynthesis, and, eventually, changed, it, from, a, weakly, reducing, atmosphere, practically, devoid, of, oxygen, into, an, oxidizing, one, containing, abundant, free, oxygen, with, oxygen, levels, being, as, high, as, 10, of, modern, atmospheric, level, by, the, end, of, the, goe, the, appearance, of, highly, reactive, free, oxygen, which, can, oxidize, organic, compounds, especially, genetic, materials, and, thus, is, toxic, to, the, then, mostly, anaerobic, biosphere, may, have, caused, the, extinction, extirpation, of, many, early, organisms, on, earth, mostly, archaeal, colonies, that, used, retinal, to, use, green, spectrum, light, energy, and, power, a, form, of, anoxygenic, photosynthesis, see, purple, earth, hypothesis, although, the, event, is, inferred, to, have, constituted, a, mass, extinction, due, in, part, to, the, great, difficulty, in, surveying, microscopic, organisms, abundances, and, in, part, to, the, extreme, age, of, fossil, remains, from, that, time, the, great, oxidation, event, is, typically, not, counted, among, conventional, lists, of, great, extinctions, which, are, implicitly, limited, to, the, phanerozoic, eon, in, any, case, isotope, geochemistry, data, from, sulfate, minerals, have, been, interpreted, to, indicate, a, decrease, in, the, size, of, the, biosphere, of, 80, associated, with, changes, in, nutrient, supplies, at, the, end, of, the, goe, the, goe, is, inferred, to, have, been, caused, by, cyanobacteria, which, evolved, chlorophyll, based, photosynthesis, that, releases, dioxygen, as, a, byproduct, of, water, photolysis, the, continually, produced, oxygen, eventually, depleted, all, the, surface, reducing, capacity, from, ferrous, iron, sulfur, hydrogen, sulfide, and, atmospheric, methane, over, nearly, a, billion, years, the, oxidative, environmental, change, compounded, by, a, global, glaciation, devastated, the, microbial, mats, around, the, earth, s, surface, the, subsequent, adaptation, of, surviving, archaea, via, symbiogenesis, with, aerobic, proteobacteria, which, went, endosymbiont, and, became, mitochondria, may, have, led, to, the, rise, of, eukaryotic, organisms, and, the, subsequent, evolution, of, multicellular, life, forms, the, composition, of, the, earth, s, earliest, atmosphere, is, not, known, with, certainty, however, the, bulk, was, likely, nitrogen, n, 2, and, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, which, are, also, the, predominant, nitrogen, and, carbon, bearing, gases, produced, by, volcanism, today, these, are, relatively, inert, gases, oxygen, o, 2, meanwhile, was, present, in, the, atmosphere, at, just, 0, 001, of, its, present, atmospheric, level, the, sun, shone, at, about, 70, of, its, current, brightness, 4, billion, years, ago, but, there, is, strong, evidence, that, liquid, water, existed, on, earth, at, the, time, a, warm, earth, in, spite, of, a, faint, sun, is, known, as, the, faint, young, sun, paradox, either, co, 2, levels, were, much, higher, at, the, time, providing, enough, of, a, greenhouse, effect, to, warm, the, earth, or, other, greenhouse, gases, were, present, the, most, likely, such, gas, is, methane, ch, 4, which, is, a, powerful, greenhouse, gas, and, was, produced, by, early, forms, of, life, known, as, methanogens, scientists, continue, to, research, how, the, earth, was, warmed, before, life, arose, an, atmosphere, of, n, 2, and, co, 2, with, trace, amounts, of, h, 2, o, ch, 4, carbon, monoxide, co, and, hydrogen, h, 2, is, described, as, a, weakly, reducing, atmosphere, such, an, atmosphere, contains, practically, no, oxygen, the, modern, atmosphere, contains, abundant, oxygen, nearly, 21, making, it, an, oxidizing, atmosphere, the, rise, in, oxygen, is, attributed, to, photosynthesis, by, cyanobacteria, which, are, thought, to, have, evolved, as, early, as, 3, 5, billion, years, ago, the, current, scientific, understanding, of, when, and, how, the, earth, s, atmosphere, changed, from, a, weakly, reducing, to, a, strongly, oxidizing, atmosphere, largely, began, with, the, work, of, the, american, geologist, preston, cloud, in, the, 1970s, cloud, observed, that, detrital, sediments, older, than, about, 2, billion, years, contained, grains, of, pyrite, uraninite, and, siderite, all, minerals, containing, reduced, forms, of, iron, or, uranium, that, are, not, found, in, younger, sediments, because, they, are, rapidly, oxidized, in, an, oxidizing, atmosphere, he, further, observed, that, continental, red, beds, which, get, their, color, from, the, oxidized, ferric, mineral, hematite, began, to, appear, in, the, geological, record, at, about, this, time, banded, iron, formation, largely, disappears, from, the, geological, record, at, 1, 85, ga, after, peaking, at, about, 2, 5, ga, banded, iron, formation, can, form, only, when, abundant, dissolved, ferrous, iron, is, transported, into, depositional, basins, and, an, oxygenated, ocean, blocks, such, transport, by, oxidizing, the, iron, to, form, insoluble, ferric, iron, compounds, the, end, of, the, deposition, of, banded, iron, formation, at, 1, 85, ga, is, therefore, interpreted, as, marking, the, oxygenation, of, the, deep, ocean, heinrich, holland, further, elaborated, these, ideas, through, the, 1980s, placing, the, main, time, interval, of, oxygenation, between, 2, 2, and, 1, 9, ga, constraining, the, onset, of, atmospheric, oxygenation, has, proven, particularly, challenging, for, geologists, and, geochemists, while, there, is, a, widespread, consensus, that, initial, oxygenation, of, the, atmosphere, happened, sometime, during, the, first, half, of, the, paleoproterozoic, there, is, disagreement, on, the, exact, timing, of, this, event, scientific, publications, between, 2016, 2022, have, differed, in, the, inferred, timing, of, the, onset, of, atmospheric, oxygenation, by, approximately, 500, million, years, estimates, of, 2, 7, ga, 2, 501, 2, 434, ga, 2, 501, 2, 225, ga, 2, 460, 2, 426, ga, 2, 430, ga, 2, 33, ga, and, 2, 3, ga, have, been, given, factors, limiting, calculations, include, an, incomplete, sedimentary, record, for, the, paleoproterozoic, e, g, because, of, subduction, and, metamorphism, uncertainties, in, depositional, ages, for, many, ancient, sedimentary, units, and, uncertainties, related, to, the, interpretation, of, different, geological, geochemical, proxies, while, the, effects, of, an, incomplete, geological, record, have, been, discussed, and, quantified, in, the, field, of, paleontology, for, several, decades, particularly, with, respect, to, the, evolution, and, extinction, of, organisms, the, signor, lipps, effect, this, is, rarely, quantified, when, considering, geochemical, records, and, may, therefore, lead, to, uncertainties, for, scientists, studying, the, timing, of, atmospheric, oxygenation, evidence, for, the, great, oxidation, event, is, provided, by, a, variety, of, petrological, and, geochemical, markers, that, define, this, geological, event, paleosols, detrital, grains, and, red, beds, are, evidence, of, low, oxygen, levels, paleosols, fossil, soils, older, than, 2, 4, billion, years, old, have, low, iron, concentrations, that, suggest, anoxic, weathering, detrital, grains, composed, of, pyrite, siderite, and, uraninite, redox, sensitive, detrital, minerals, are, found, in, sediments, older, than, ca, 2, 4, ga, these, minerals, are, only, stable, under, low, oxygen, conditions, and, so, their, occurrence, as, detrital, minerals, in, fluvial, and, deltaic, sediments, are, widely, interpreted, as, evidence, of, an, anoxic, atmosphere, in, contrast, to, redox, sensitive, detrital, minerals, are, red, beds, red, colored, sandstones, that, are, coated, with, hematite, the, occurrence, of, red, beds, indicates, that, there, was, sufficient, oxygen, to, oxidize, iron, to, its, ferric, state, and, these, represent, a, marked, contrast, to, sandstones, deposited, under, anoxic, conditions, which, are, often, beige, white, grey, or, green, banded, iron, formations, are, composed, of, thin, alternating, layers, of, chert, a, fine, grained, form, of, silica, and, iron, oxides, magnetite, and, hematite, extensive, deposits, of, this, rock, type, are, found, around, the, world, almost, all, of, which, are, more, than, 1, 85, billion, years, old, and, most, of, which, were, deposited, around, 2, 5, ga, the, iron, in, banded, iron, formations, is, partially, oxidized, with, roughly, equal, amounts, of, ferrous, and, ferric, iron, deposition, of, a, banded, iron, formation, requires, both, an, anoxic, deep, ocean, capable, of, transporting, iron, in, soluble, ferrous, form, and, an, oxidized, shallow, ocean, where, the, ferrous, iron, is, oxidized, to, insoluble, ferric, iron, and, precipitates, onto, the, ocean, floor, the, deposition, of, banded, iron, formations, before, 1, 8, ga, suggests, the, ocean, was, in, a, persistent, ferruginous, state, but, deposition, was, episodic, and, there, may, have, been, significant, intervals, of, euxinia, the, transition, from, deposition, of, banded, iron, formations, to, manganese, oxides, in, some, strata, has, been, considered, a, key, tipping, point, in, the, timing, of, the, goe, because, it, is, believed, to, indicate, the, escape, of, significant, molecular, oxygen, into, the, atmosphere, in, the, absence, of, ferrous, iron, as, a, reducing, agent, black, laminated, shales, rich, in, organic, matter, are, often, regarded, as, a, marker, for, anoxic, conditions, however, the, deposition, of, abundant, organic, matter, is, not, a, sure, indication, of, anoxia, and, burrowing, organisms, that, destroy, lamination, had, not, yet, evolved, during, the, time, frame, of, the, great, oxygenation, event, thus, laminated, black, shale, by, itself, is, a, poor, indicator, of, oxygen, levels, scientists, must, look, instead, for, geochemical, evidence, of, anoxic, conditions, these, include, ferruginous, anoxia, in, which, dissolved, ferrous, iron, is, abundant, and, euxinia, in, which, hydrogen, sulfide, is, present, in, the, water, examples, of, such, indicators, of, anoxic, conditions, include, the, degree, of, pyritization, dop, which, is, the, ratio, of, iron, present, as, pyrite, to, the, total, reactive, iron, reactive, iron, in, turn, is, defined, as, iron, found, in, oxides, and, oxyhydroxides, carbonates, and, reduced, sulfur, minerals, such, as, pyrites, in, contrast, with, iron, tightly, bound, in, silicate, minerals, a, dop, near, zero, indicates, oxidizing, conditions, while, a, dop, near, 1, indicates, euxinic, conditions, values, of, 0, 3, to, 0, 5, are, transitional, suggesting, anoxic, bottom, mud, under, an, oxygenated, ocean, studies, of, the, black, sea, which, is, considered, a, modern, model, for, ancient, anoxic, ocean, basins, indicate, that, high, dop, a, high, ratio, of, reactive, iron, to, total, iron, and, a, high, ratio, of, total, iron, to, aluminum, are, all, indicators, of, transport, of, iron, into, a, euxinic, environment, ferruginous, anoxic, conditions, can, be, distinguished, from, euxenic, conditions, by, a, dop, less, than, about, 0, 7, the, currently, available, evidence, suggests, that, the, deep, ocean, remained, anoxic, and, ferruginous, as, late, as, 580, ma, well, after, the, great, oxygenation, event, remaining, just, short, of, euxenic, during, much, of, this, interval, of, time, deposition, of, banded, iron, formation, ceased, when, conditions, of, local, euxenia, on, continental, platforms, and, shelves, began, precipitating, iron, out, of, upwelling, ferruginous, water, as, pyrite, some, of, the, most, persuasive, evidence, for, the, great, oxidation, event, is, provided, by, the, mass, independent, fractionation, mif, of, sulfur, the, chemical, signature, of, the, mif, of, sulfur, is, found, prior, to, 2, 4, 2, 3, ga, but, disappears, thereafter, the, presence, of, this, signature, all, but, eliminates, the, possibility, of, an, oxygenated, atmosphere, different, isotopes, of, a, chemical, element, have, slightly, different, atomic, masses, most, of, the, differences, in, geochemistry, between, isotopes, of, the, same, element, scale, with, this, mass, difference, these, include, small, differences, in, molecular, velocities, and, diffusion, rates, which, are, described, as, mass, dependent, fractionation, processes, by, contrast, mif, describes, processes, that, are, not, proportional, to, the, difference, in, mass, between, isotopes, the, only, such, process, likely, to, be, significant, in, the, geochemistry, of, sulfur, is, photodissociation, this, is, the, process, in, which, a, molecule, containing, sulfur, is, broken, up, by, solar, ultraviolet, uv, radiation, the, presence, of, a, clear, mif, signature, for, sulfur, prior, to, 2, 4, ga, shows, that, uv, radiation, was, penetrating, deep, into, the, earth, s, atmosphere, this, in, turn, rules, out, an, atmosphere, containing, more, than, traces, of, oxygen, which, would, have, produced, an, ozone, layer, that, would, have, shielded, the, lower, atmosphere, from, uv, radiation, the, disappearance, of, the, mif, signature, for, sulfur, indicates, the, formation, of, such, an, ozone, shield, as, oxygen, began, to, accumulate, in, the, atmosphere, mif, of, sulphur, also, indicates, the, presence, of, oxygen, in, that, oxygen, is, required, to, facilitate, repeated, redox, cycling, of, sulphur, mif, provides, clues, to, the, great, oxygenation, event, for, example, oxidation, of, manganese, in, surface, rocks, by, atmospheric, oxygen, leads, to, further, reactions, that, oxidize, chromium, the, heavier, 53, cr, is, oxidized, preferentially, over, the, lighter, 52, cr, and, the, soluble, oxidized, chromium, carried, into, the, ocean, shows, this, enhancement, of, the, heavier, isotope, the, chromium, isotope, ratio, in, banded, iron, formation, suggests, small, but, significant, quantities, of, oxygen, in, the, atmosphere, before, the, great, oxidation, event, and, a, brief, return, to, low, oxygen, abundance, 500, ma, after, the, goe, however, the, chromium, data, may, conflict, with, the, sulfur, isotope, data, which, calls, the, reliability, of, the, chromium, data, into, question, it, is, also, possible, that, oxygen, was, present, earlier, only, in, localized, oxygen, oases, since, chromium, is, not, easily, dissolved, its, release, from, rocks, requires, the, presence, of, a, powerful, acid, such, as, sulfuric, acid, h, 2, so, 4, which, may, have, formed, through, bacterial, oxidation, of, pyrite, this, could, provide, some, of, the, earliest, evidence, of, oxygen, breathing, life, on, land, surfaces, other, elements, whose, mif, may, provide, clues, to, the, goe, include, carbon, nitrogen, transitional, metals, such, as, molybdenum, and, iron, and, non, metal, elements, such, as, selenium, while, the, goe, is, generally, thought, to, be, a, result, of, oxygenic, photosynthesis, by, ancestral, cyanobacteria, the, presence, of, cyanobacteria, in, the, archaean, before, the, goe, is, a, highly, controversial, topic, structures, that, are, claimed, to, be, fossils, of, cyanobacteria, exist, in, rock, formed, 3, 5, ga, these, include, microfossils, of, supposedly, cyanobacterial, cells, and, macrofossils, called, stromatolites, which, are, interpreted, as, colonies, of, microbes, including, cyanobacteria, with, characteristic, layered, structures, modern, stromatolites, which, can, only, be, seen, in, harsh, environments, such, as, shark, bay, in, western, australia, are, associated, with, cyanobacteria, and, thus, fossil, stromatolites, had, long, been, interpreted, as, the, evidence, for, cyanobacteria, however, it, has, increasingly, been, inferred, that, at, least, some, of, these, archaean, fossils, were, generated, abiotically, or, produced, by, non, cyanobacterial, phototrophic, bacteria, additionally, archaean, sedimentary, rocks, were, once, found, to, contain, biomarkers, also, known, as, chemical, fossils, interpreted, as, fossilized, membrane, lipids, from, cyanobacteria, and, eukaryotes, for, example, traces, of, 2, methylhopanes, and, steranes, that, are, thought, to, be, derived, from, cyanobacteria, and, eukaryotes, respectively, were, found, in, the, pilbara, of, western, australia, steranes, are, diagenetic, products, of, sterols, which, are, biosynthesized, using, molecular, oxygen, thus, steranes, can, additionally, serve, as, an, indicator, of, oxygen, in, the, atmosphere, however, these, biomarker, samples, have, since, been, shown, to, have, been, contaminated, and, so, the, results, are, no, longer, accepted, carbonaceous, microfossils, from, the, turee, creek, group, of, western, australia, which, date, back, to, 2, 45, 2, 21, ga, have, been, interpreted, as, iron, oxidising, bacteria, their, presence, suggests, a, minimum, threshold, of, seawater, oxygen, content, had, been, reached, by, this, interval, of, time, some, elements, in, marine, sediments, are, sensitive, to, different, levels, of, oxygen, in, the, environment, such, as, the, transition, metals, molybdenum, and, rhenium, non, metal, elements, such, as, selenium, and, iodine, are, also, indicators, of, oxygen, levels, the, ability, to, generate, oxygen, via, photosynthesis, likely, first, appeared, in, the, ancestors, of, cyanobacteria, these, organisms, evolved, at, least, 2, 45, 2, 32, ga, and, probably, as, early, as, 2, 7, ga, or, earlier, however, oxygen, remained, scarce, in, the, atmosphere, until, around, 2, 0, ga, and, banded, iron, formation, continued, to, be, deposited, until, around, 1, 85, ga, given, the, rapid, multiplication, rate, of, cyanobacteria, under, ideal, conditions, an, explanation, is, needed, for, the, delay, of, at, least, 400, million, years, between, the, evolution, of, oxygen, producing, photosynthesis, and, the, appearance, of, significant, oxygen, in, the, atmosphere, hypotheses, to, explain, this, gap, must, take, into, consideration, the, balance, between, oxygen, sources, and, oxygen, sinks, oxygenic, photosynthesis, produces, organic, carbon, that, must, be, segregated, from, oxygen, to, allow, oxygen, accumulation, in, the, surface, environment, otherwise, the, oxygen, back, reacts, with, the, organic, carbon, and, does, not, accumulate, the, burial, of, organic, carbon, sulfide, and, minerals, containing, ferrous, iron, fe, 2, is, a, primary, factor, in, oxygen, accumulation, when, organic, carbon, is, buried, without, being, oxidized, the, oxygen, is, left, in, the, atmosphere, in, total, the, burial, of, organic, carbon, and, pyrite, today, creates, 15, 8, 3, 3, tmol, 1, tmol, 10, 12, moles, of, o, 2, per, year, this, creates, a, net, o, 2, flux, from, the, global, oxygen, sources, the, rate, of, change, of, oxygen, can, be, calculated, from, the, difference, between, global, sources, and, sinks, the, oxygen, sinks, include, reduced, gases, and, minerals, from, volcanoes, metamorphism, and, weathering, the, goe, started, after, these, oxygen, sink, fluxes, and, reduced, gas, fluxes, were, exceeded, by, the, flux, of, o, 2, associated, with, the, burial, of, reductants, such, as, organic, carbon, about, 12, 0, 3, 3, tmol, of, o, 2, per, year, today, goes, to, the, sinks, composed, of, reduced, minerals, and, gases, from, volcanoes, metamorphism, percolating, seawater, and, heat, vents, from, the, seafloor, on, the, other, hand, 5, 7, 1, 2, tmol, of, o, 2, per, year, today, oxidizes, reduced, gases, in, the, atmosphere, through, photochemical, reaction, on, the, early, earth, there, was, visibly, very, little, oxidative, weathering, of, continents, e, g, a, lack, of, red, beds, and, so, the, weathering, sink, on, oxygen, would, have, been, negligible, compared, to, that, from, reduced, gases, and, dissolved, iron, in, oceans, dissolved, iron, in, oceans, exemplifies, o, 2, sinks, free, oxygen, produced, during, this, time, was, chemically, captured, by, dissolved, iron, converting, iron, fe, and, fe, 2, to, magnetite, fe, 2, fe, 3, 2, o, 4, that, is, insoluble, in, water, and, sank, to, the, bottom, of, the, shallow, seas, to, create, banded, iron, formations, it, took, 50, million, years, or, longer, to, deplete, the, oxygen, sinks, the, rate, of, photosynthesis, and, associated, rate, of, organic, burial, also, affect, the, rate, of, oxygen, accumulation, when, land, plants, spread, over, the, continents, in, the, devonian, more, organic, carbon, was, buried, and, likely, allowed, higher, o, 2, levels, to, occur, today, the, average, time, that, an, o, 2, molecule, spends, in, the, air, before, it, is, consumed, by, geological, sinks, is, about, 2, million, years, that, residence, time, is, relatively, short, in, geologic, time, so, in, the, phanerozoic, there, must, have, been, feedback, processes, that, kept, the, atmospheric, o, 2, level, within, bounds, suitable, for, animal, life, preston, cloud, originally, proposed, that, the, first, cyanobacteria, had, evolved, the, capacity, to, carry, out, oxygen, producing, photosynthesis, but, had, not, yet, evolved, enzymes, such, as, superoxide, dismutase, for, living, in, an, oxygenated, environment, these, cyanobacteria, would, have, been, protected, from, their, own, poisonous, oxygen, waste, through, its, rapid, removal, via, the, high, levels, of, reduced, ferrous, iron, fe, ii, in, the, early, ocean, he, suggested, that, the, oxygen, released, by, photosynthesis, oxidized, the, fe, ii, to, ferric, iron, fe, iii, which, precipitated, out, of, the, sea, water, to, form, banded, iron, formation, he, interpreted, the, great, peak, in, deposition, of, banded, iron, formation, at, the, end, of, the, archean, as, the, signature, for, the, evolution, of, mechanisms, for, living, with, oxygen, this, ended, self, poisoning, and, produced, a, population, explosion, in, the, cyanobacteria, that, rapidly, oxygenated, the, ocean, and, ended, banded, iron, formation, deposition, however, improved, dating, of, precambrian, strata, showed, that, the, late, archean, peak, of, deposition, was, spread, out, over, tens, of, millions, of, years, rather, than, taking, place, in, a, very, short, interval, of, time, following, the, evolution, of, oxygen, coping, mechanisms, this, made, cloud, s, hypothesis, untenable, most, modern, interpretations, describe, the, goe, as, a, long, protracted, process, that, took, place, over, hundreds, of, millions, of, years, rather, than, a, single, abrupt, event, with, the, quantity, of, atmospheric, oxygen, fluctuating, in, relation, to, the, capacity, of, oxygen, sinks, and, the, productivity, of, oxygenic, photosynthesisers, over, the, course, of, the, goe, more, recently, families, of, bacteria, have, been, discovered, that, closely, resemble, cyanobacteria, but, show, no, indication, of, ever, having, possessed, photosynthetic, capability, these, may, be, descended, from, the, earliest, ancestors, of, cyanobacteria, which, only, later, acquired, photosynthetic, ability, by, lateral, gene, transfer, based, on, molecular, clock, data, the, evolution, of, oxygen, producing, photosynthesis, may, have, occurred, much, later, than, previously, thought, at, around, 2, 5, ga, this, reduces, the, gap, between, the, evolution, of, oxygen, photosynthesis, and, the, appearance, of, significant, atmospheric, oxygen, another, possibility, is, that, early, cyanobacteria, were, starved, for, vital, nutrients, and, this, checked, their, growth, however, a, lack, of, the, scarcest, nutrients, iron, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, could, have, slowed, but, not, prevented, a, cyanobacteria, population, explosion, and, rapid, oxygenation, the, explanation, for, the, delay, in, the, oxygenation, of, the, atmosphere, following, the, evolution, of, oxygen, producing, photosynthesis, likely, lies, in, the, presence, of, various, oxygen, sinks, on, the, young, earth, early, chemosynthetic, organisms, likely, produced, methane, an, important, trap, for, molecular, oxygen, since, methane, readily, oxidizes, to, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, and, water, in, the, presence, of, uv, radiation, modern, methanogens, require, nickel, as, an, enzyme, cofactor, as, the, earth, s, crust, cooled, and, the, supply, of, volcanic, nickel, dwindled, oxygen, producing, algae, began, to, outperform, methane, producers, and, the, oxygen, percentage, of, the, atmosphere, steadily, increased, from, 2, 7, to, 2, 4, ga, the, rate, of, deposition, of, nickel, declined, steadily, from, a, level, 400, times, that, of, today, this, nickel, famine, was, somewhat, buffered, by, an, uptick, in, sulfide, weathering, at, the, start, of, the, goe, that, brought, some, nickel, to, the, oceans, without, which, methanogenic, organisms, would, have, declined, in, abundance, more, precipitously, plunging, earth, into, even, more, severe, and, long, lasting, icehouse, conditions, than, those, seen, during, the, huronian, glaciation, another, hypothesis, posits, that, a, number, of, large, igneous, provinces, lips, were, emplaced, during, the, goe, and, fertilised, the, oceans, with, limiting, nutrients, facilitating, and, sustaining, cyanobacterial, blooms, one, hypothesis, argues, that, the, goe, was, the, immediate, result, of, photosynthesis, although, the, majority, of, scientists, suggest, that, a, long, term, increase, of, oxygen, is, more, likely, several, model, results, show, possibilities, of, long, term, increase, of, carbon, burial, but, the, conclusions, are, indeterminate, in, contrast, to, the, increasing, flux, hypothesis, there, are, several, hypotheses, that, attempt, to, use, decrease, of, sinks, to, explain, the, goe, one, theory, suggests, increasing, lacustrine, organic, carbon, burial, as, a, cause, with, more, reduced, carbon, being, buried, there, was, less, of, it, for, free, oxygen, to, react, with, in, the, atmosphere, and, oceans, enabling, its, buildup, a, different, theory, suggests, that, the, composition, of, the, volatiles, from, volcanic, gases, was, more, oxidized, another, theory, suggests, that, the, decrease, of, metamorphic, gases, and, serpentinization, is, the, main, key, of, goe, hydrogen, and, methane, released, from, metamorphic, processes, are, also, lost, from, earth, s, atmosphere, over, time, and, leave, the, crust, oxidized, scientists, realized, that, hydrogen, would, escape, into, space, through, a, process, called, methane, photolysis, in, which, methane, decomposes, under, the, action, of, ultraviolet, light, in, the, upper, atmosphere, and, releases, its, hydrogen, the, escape, of, hydrogen, from, the, earth, into, space, must, have, oxidized, the, earth, because, the, process, of, hydrogen, loss, is, chemical, oxidation, this, process, of, hydrogen, escape, required, the, generation, of, methane, by, methanogens, so, that, methanogens, actually, helped, create, the, conditions, necessary, for, the, oxidation, of, the, atmosphere, one, hypothesis, suggests, that, the, oxygen, increase, had, to, await, tectonically, driven, changes, in, the, earth, including, the, appearance, of, shelf, seas, where, reduced, organic, carbon, could, reach, the, sediments, and, be, buried, the, burial, of, reduced, carbon, as, graphite, or, diamond, around, subduction, zones, released, molecular, oxygen, into, the, atmosphere, the, appearance, of, oxidised, magmas, enriched, in, sulphur, formed, around, subduction, zones, confirms, changes, in, tectonic, regime, played, an, important, role, in, the, oxygenation, of, earth, s, atmosphere, the, newly, produced, oxygen, was, first, consumed, in, various, chemical, reactions, in, the, oceans, primarily, with, iron, evidence, is, found, in, older, rocks, that, contain, massive, banded, iron, formations, apparently, laid, down, as, this, iron, and, oxygen, first, combined, most, present, day, iron, ore, lies, in, these, deposits, it, was, assumed, oxygen, released, from, cyanobacteria, resulted, in, the, chemical, reactions, that, created, rust, but, it, appears, the, iron, formations, were, caused, by, anoxygenic, phototrophic, iron, oxidizing, bacteria, which, does, not, require, oxygen, evidence, suggests, oxygen, levels, spiked, each, time, smaller, land, masses, collided, to, form, a, super, continent, tectonic, pressure, thrust, up, mountain, chains, which, eroded, releasing, nutrients, into, the, ocean, that, fed, photosynthetic, cyanobacteria, another, hypothesis, posits, a, model, of, the, atmosphere, that, exhibits, bistability, two, steady, states, of, oxygen, concentration, the, state, of, stable, low, oxygen, concentration, 0, 02, experiences, a, high, rate, of, methane, oxidation, if, some, event, raises, oxygen, levels, beyond, a, moderate, threshold, the, formation, of, an, ozone, layer, shields, uv, rays, and, decreases, methane, oxidation, raising, oxygen, further, to, a, stable, state, of, 21, or, more, the, great, oxygenation, event, can, then, be, understood, as, a, transition, from, the, lower, to, the, upper, steady, states, cyanobacteria, tend, to, consume, nearly, as, much, oxygen, at, night, as, they, produce, during, the, day, however, experiments, demonstrate, that, cyanobacterial, mats, produce, a, greater, excess, of, oxygen, with, longer, photoperiods, the, rotational, period, of, the, earth, was, only, about, six, hours, shortly, after, its, formation, 4, 5, ga, but, increased, to, 21, hours, by, 2, 4, ga, in, the, paleoproterozoic, the, rotational, period, increased, again, starting, 700, million, years, ago, to, its, present, value, of, 24, hours, the, total, amount, of, oxygen, produced, by, the, cyanobacteria, remained, the, same, with, longer, days, but, the, longer, the, day, the, more, time, oxygen, has, to, diffuse, into, the, water, eventually, oxygen, started, to, accumulate, in, the, atmosphere, with, two, major, consequences, the, great, oxygenation, event, triggered, an, explosive, growth, in, the, diversity, of, minerals, with, many, elements, occurring, in, one, or, more, oxidized, forms, near, the, earth, s, surface, it, is, estimated, that, the, goe, was, directly, responsible, for, deposition, of, more, than, 2, 500, of, the, total, of, about, 4, 500, minerals, found, on, earth, today, most, of, these, new, minerals, were, formed, as, hydrated, and, oxidized, forms, due, to, dynamic, mantle, and, crust, processes, in, field, studies, done, in, lake, fryxell, antarctica, scientists, found, that, mats, of, oxygen, producing, cyanobacteria, produced, a, thin, layer, one, to, two, millimeters, thick, of, oxygenated, water, in, an, otherwise, anoxic, environment, even, under, thick, ice, by, inference, these, organisms, could, have, adapted, to, oxygen, even, before, oxygen, accumulated, in, the, atmosphere, the, evolution, of, such, oxygen, dependent, organisms, eventually, established, an, equilibrium, in, the, availability, of, oxygen, which, became, a, major, constituent, of, the, atmosphere, it, has, been, proposed, that, a, local, rise, in, oxygen, levels, due, to, cyanobacterial, photosynthesis, in, ancient, microenvironments, was, highly, toxic, to, the, surrounding, biota, and, that, this, selective, pressure, drove, the, evolutionary, transformation, of, an, archaeal, lineage, into, the, first, eukaryotes, oxidative, stress, involving, production, of, reactive, oxygen, species, ros, might, have, acted, in, synergy, with, other, environmental, stresses, such, as, ultraviolet, radiation, and, or, desiccation, to, drive, selection, in, an, early, archaeal, lineage, towards, eukaryosis, this, archaeal, ancestor, may, already, have, had, dna, repair, mechanisms, based, on, dna, pairing, and, recombination, and, possibly, some, kind, of, cell, fusion, mechanism, the, detrimental, effects, of, internal, ros, produced, by, endosymbiont, proto, mitochondria, on, the, archaeal, genome, could, have, promoted, the, evolution, of, meiotic, sex, from, these, humble, beginnings, selective, pressure, for, efficient, dna, repair, of, oxidative, dna, damage, may, have, driven, the, evolution, of, eukaryotic, sex, involving, such, features, as, cell, cell, fusions, cytoskeleton, mediated, chromosome, movements, and, emergence, of, the, nuclear, membrane, thus, the, evolution, of, eukaryotic, sex, and, eukaryogenesis, were, likely, inseparable, processes, that, evolved, in, large, part, to, facilitate, dna, repair, the, evolution, of, mitochondria, which, are, well, suited, for, oxygenated, environments, may, have, occurred, during, the, goe, however, other, authors, express, scepticism, that, the, goe, resulted, in, widespread, eukaryotic, diversification, due, to, the, lack, of, robust, evidence, concluding, that, the, oxygenation, of, the, oceans, and, atmosphere, does, not, necessarily, lead, to, increases, in, ecological, and, physiological, diversity, the, rise, in, oxygen, content, was, not, linear, instead, there, was, a, rise, in, oxygen, content, around, 2, 3, ga, followed, by, a, drop, around, 2, 1, ga, this, rise, in, oxygen, is, called, the, lomagundi, jatuli, event, or, lomagundi, event, named, for, a, district, of, southern, rhodesia, and, the, time, period, has, been, termed, jatulian, it, is, currently, considered, to, be, part, of, the, rhyacian, period, during, the, lomagundi, jatuli, event, oxygen, amounts, in, the, atmosphere, reached, similar, heights, to, modern, levels, before, returning, to, low, levels, during, the, following, stage, which, caused, the, deposition, of, black, shales, rocks, that, contain, large, amounts, of, organic, matter, that, would, otherwise, have, been, burned, away, by, oxygen, this, drop, in, oxygen, levels, is, called, the, shunga, francevillian, event, evidence, for, the, event, has, been, found, globally, in, places, such, as, fennoscandia, and, the, wyoming, craton, oceans, seem, to, have, stayed, rich, in, oxygen, for, some, time, even, after, the, event, ended, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, eukaryotes, first, evolved, during, the, lomagundi, jatuli, event
