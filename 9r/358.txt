aluminium, or, aluminum, in, north, american, english, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, al, and, atomic, number, 13, aluminium, has, a, density, lower, than, that, of, other, common, metals, about, one, third, that, of, steel, it, has, a, great, affinity, towards, oxygen, forming, a, protective, layer, of, oxide, on, the, surface, when, exposed, to, air, aluminium, visually, resembles, silver, both, in, its, color, and, in, its, great, ability, to, reflect, light, it, is, soft, nonmagnetic, and, ductile, it, has, one, stable, isotope, 27, al, which, is, highly, abundant, making, aluminium, the, twelfth, most, common, element, in, the, universe, the, radioactivity, of, 26, al, a, more, unstable, isotope, leads, to, it, being, used, in, radiometric, dating, chemically, aluminium, is, a, post, transition, metal, in, the, boron, group, as, is, common, for, the, group, aluminium, forms, compounds, primarily, in, the, 3, oxidation, state, the, aluminium, cation, al, 3, is, small, and, highly, charged, as, such, it, has, more, polarizing, power, and, bonds, formed, by, aluminium, have, a, more, covalent, character, the, strong, affinity, of, aluminium, for, oxygen, leads, to, the, common, occurrence, of, its, oxides, in, nature, aluminium, is, found, on, earth, primarily, in, rocks, in, the, crust, where, it, is, the, third, most, abundant, element, after, oxygen, and, silicon, rather, than, in, the, mantle, and, virtually, never, as, the, free, metal, it, is, obtained, industrially, by, mining, bauxite, a, sedimentary, rock, rich, in, aluminium, minerals, the, discovery, of, aluminium, was, announced, in, 1825, by, danish, physicist, hans, christian, rsted, the, first, industrial, production, of, aluminium, was, initiated, by, french, chemist, henri, tienne, sainte, claire, deville, in, 1856, aluminium, became, much, more, available, to, the, public, with, the, hall, h, roult, process, developed, independently, by, french, engineer, paul, h, roult, and, american, engineer, charles, martin, hall, in, 1886, and, the, mass, production, of, aluminium, led, to, its, extensive, use, in, industry, and, everyday, life, in, the, first, and, second, world, wars, aluminium, was, a, crucial, strategic, resource, for, aviation, in, 1954, aluminium, became, the, most, produced, non, ferrous, metal, surpassing, copper, in, the, 21st, century, most, aluminium, was, consumed, in, transportation, engineering, construction, and, packaging, in, the, united, states, western, europe, and, japan, despite, its, prevalence, in, the, environment, no, living, organism, is, known, to, metabolize, aluminium, salts, but, this, aluminium, is, well, tolerated, by, plants, and, animals, because, of, the, abundance, of, these, salts, the, potential, for, a, biological, role, for, them, is, of, interest, and, studies, are, ongoing, of, aluminium, isotopes, only, 27, al, is, stable, this, situation, is, common, for, elements, with, an, odd, atomic, number, it, is, the, only, primordial, aluminium, isotope, i, e, the, only, one, that, has, existed, on, earth, in, its, current, form, since, the, formation, of, the, planet, it, is, therefore, a, mononuclidic, element, and, its, standard, atomic, weight, is, virtually, the, same, as, that, of, the, isotope, this, makes, aluminium, very, useful, in, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, nmr, as, its, single, stable, isotope, has, a, high, nmr, sensitivity, the, standard, atomic, weight, of, aluminium, is, low, in, comparison, with, many, other, metals, all, other, isotopes, of, aluminium, are, radioactive, the, most, stable, of, these, is, 26, al, while, it, was, present, along, with, stable, 27, al, in, the, interstellar, medium, from, which, the, solar, system, formed, having, been, produced, by, stellar, nucleosynthesis, as, well, its, half, life, is, only, 717, 000, years, and, therefore, a, detectable, amount, has, not, survived, since, the, formation, of, the, planet, however, minute, traces, of, 26, al, are, produced, from, argon, in, the, atmosphere, by, spallation, caused, by, cosmic, ray, protons, the, ratio, of, 26, al, to, 10, be, has, been, used, for, radiodating, of, geological, processes, over, 10, 5, to, 10, 6, year, time, scales, in, particular, transport, deposition, sediment, storage, burial, times, and, erosion, most, meteorite, scientists, believe, that, the, energy, released, by, the, decay, of, 26, al, was, responsible, for, the, melting, and, differentiation, of, some, asteroids, after, their, formation, 4, 55, billion, years, ago, the, remaining, isotopes, of, aluminium, with, mass, numbers, ranging, from, 21, to, 43, all, have, half, lives, well, under, an, hour, three, metastable, states, are, known, all, with, half, lives, under, a, minute, an, aluminium, atom, has, 13, electrons, arranged, in, an, electron, configuration, of, 3s, 2, 3p, 1, with, three, electrons, beyond, a, stable, noble, gas, configuration, accordingly, the, combined, first, three, ionization, energies, of, aluminium, are, far, lower, than, the, fourth, ionization, energy, alone, such, an, electron, configuration, is, shared, with, the, other, well, characterized, members, of, its, group, boron, gallium, indium, and, thallium, it, is, also, expected, for, nihonium, aluminium, can, surrender, its, three, outermost, electrons, in, many, chemical, reactions, see, below, the, electronegativity, of, aluminium, is, 1, 61, pauling, scale, a, free, aluminium, atom, has, a, radius, of, 143, pm, with, the, three, outermost, electrons, removed, the, radius, shrinks, to, 39, pm, for, a, 4, coordinated, atom, or, 53, 5, pm, for, a, 6, coordinated, atom, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, aluminium, atoms, when, not, affected, by, atoms, of, other, elements, form, a, face, centered, cubic, crystal, system, bound, by, metallic, bonding, provided, by, atoms, outermost, electrons, hence, aluminium, at, these, conditions, is, a, metal, this, crystal, system, is, shared, by, many, other, metals, such, as, lead, and, copper, the, size, of, a, unit, cell, of, aluminium, is, comparable, to, that, of, those, other, metals, the, system, however, is, not, shared, by, the, other, members, of, its, group, boron, has, ionization, energies, too, high, to, allow, metallization, thallium, has, a, hexagonal, close, packed, structure, and, gallium, and, indium, have, unusual, structures, that, are, not, close, packed, like, those, of, aluminium, and, thallium, the, few, electrons, that, are, available, for, metallic, bonding, in, aluminium, are, a, probable, cause, for, it, being, soft, with, a, low, melting, point, and, low, electrical, resistivity, aluminium, metal, has, an, appearance, ranging, from, silvery, white, to, dull, gray, depending, on, its, surface, roughness, aluminium, mirrors, are, the, most, reflective, of, all, metal, mirrors, for, near, ultraviolet, and, far, infrared, light, it, is, also, one, of, the, most, reflective, for, light, in, the, visible, spectrum, nearly, on, par, with, silver, in, this, respect, and, the, two, therefore, look, similar, aluminium, is, also, good, at, reflecting, solar, radiation, although, prolonged, exposure, to, sunlight, in, air, adds, wear, to, the, surface, of, the, metal, this, may, be, prevented, if, aluminium, is, anodized, which, adds, a, protective, layer, of, oxide, on, the, surface, the, density, of, aluminium, is, 2, 70, g, cm, 3, about, 1, 3, that, of, steel, much, lower, than, other, commonly, encountered, metals, making, aluminium, parts, easily, identifiable, through, their, lightness, aluminium, s, low, density, compared, to, most, other, metals, arises, from, the, fact, that, its, nuclei, are, much, lighter, while, difference, in, the, unit, cell, size, does, not, compensate, for, this, difference, the, only, lighter, metals, are, the, metals, of, groups, 1, and, 2, which, apart, from, beryllium, and, magnesium, are, too, reactive, for, structural, use, and, beryllium, is, very, toxic, aluminium, is, not, as, strong, or, stiff, as, steel, but, the, low, density, makes, up, for, this, in, the, aerospace, industry, and, for, many, other, applications, where, light, weight, and, relatively, high, strength, are, crucial, pure, aluminium, is, quite, soft, and, lacking, in, strength, in, most, applications, various, aluminium, alloys, are, used, instead, because, of, their, higher, strength, and, hardness, the, yield, strength, of, pure, aluminium, is, 7, 11, mpa, while, aluminium, alloys, have, yield, strengths, ranging, from, 200, mpa, to, 600, mpa, aluminium, is, ductile, with, a, percent, elongation, of, 50, 70, and, malleable, allowing, it, to, be, easily, drawn, and, extruded, it, is, also, easily, machined, and, cast, aluminium, is, an, excellent, thermal, and, electrical, conductor, having, around, 60, the, conductivity, of, copper, both, thermal, and, electrical, while, having, only, 30, of, copper, s, density, aluminium, is, capable, of, superconductivity, with, a, superconducting, critical, temperature, of, 1, 2, kelvin, and, a, critical, magnetic, field, of, about, 100, gauss, 10, milliteslas, it, is, paramagnetic, and, thus, essentially, unaffected, by, static, magnetic, fields, the, high, electrical, conductivity, however, means, that, it, is, strongly, affected, by, alternating, magnetic, fields, through, the, induction, of, eddy, currents, aluminium, combines, characteristics, of, pre, and, post, transition, metals, since, it, has, few, available, electrons, for, metallic, bonding, like, its, heavier, group, 13, congeners, it, has, the, characteristic, physical, properties, of, a, post, transition, metal, with, longer, than, expected, interatomic, distances, furthermore, as, al, 3, is, a, small, and, highly, charged, cation, it, is, strongly, polarizing, and, bonding, in, aluminium, compounds, tends, towards, covalency, this, behavior, is, similar, to, that, of, beryllium, be, 2, and, the, two, display, an, example, of, a, diagonal, relationship, the, underlying, core, under, aluminium, s, valence, shell, is, that, of, the, preceding, noble, gas, whereas, those, of, its, heavier, congeners, gallium, indium, thallium, and, nihonium, also, include, a, filled, d, subshell, and, in, some, cases, a, filled, f, subshell, hence, the, inner, electrons, of, aluminium, shield, the, valence, electrons, almost, completely, unlike, those, of, aluminium, s, heavier, congeners, as, such, aluminium, is, the, most, electropositive, metal, in, its, group, and, its, hydroxide, is, in, fact, more, basic, than, that, of, gallium, aluminium, also, bears, minor, similarities, to, the, metalloid, boron, in, the, same, group, alx, 3, compounds, are, valence, isoelectronic, to, bx, 3, compounds, they, have, the, same, valence, electronic, structure, and, both, behave, as, lewis, acids, and, readily, form, adducts, additionally, one, of, the, main, motifs, of, boron, chemistry, is, regular, icosahedral, structures, and, aluminium, forms, an, important, part, of, many, icosahedral, quasicrystal, alloys, including, the, al, zn, mg, class, aluminium, has, a, high, chemical, affinity, to, oxygen, which, renders, it, suitable, for, use, as, a, reducing, agent, in, the, thermite, reaction, a, fine, powder, of, aluminium, reacts, explosively, on, contact, with, liquid, oxygen, under, normal, conditions, however, aluminium, forms, a, thin, oxide, layer, 5, nm, at, room, temperature, that, protects, the, metal, from, further, corrosion, by, oxygen, water, or, dilute, acid, a, process, termed, passivation, because, of, its, general, resistance, to, corrosion, aluminium, is, one, of, the, few, metals, that, retains, silvery, reflectance, in, finely, powdered, form, making, it, an, important, component, of, silver, colored, paints, aluminium, is, not, attacked, by, oxidizing, acids, because, of, its, passivation, this, allows, aluminium, to, be, used, to, store, reagents, such, as, nitric, acid, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, and, some, organic, acids, in, hot, concentrated, hydrochloric, acid, aluminium, reacts, with, water, with, evolution, of, hydrogen, and, in, aqueous, sodium, hydroxide, or, potassium, hydroxide, at, room, temperature, to, form, aluminates, protective, passivation, under, these, conditions, is, negligible, aqua, regia, also, dissolves, aluminium, aluminium, is, corroded, by, dissolved, chlorides, such, as, common, sodium, chloride, which, is, why, household, plumbing, is, never, made, from, aluminium, the, oxide, layer, on, aluminium, is, also, destroyed, by, contact, with, mercury, due, to, amalgamation, or, with, salts, of, some, electropositive, metals, as, such, the, strongest, aluminium, alloys, are, less, corrosion, resistant, due, to, galvanic, reactions, with, alloyed, copper, and, aluminium, s, corrosion, resistance, is, greatly, reduced, by, aqueous, salts, particularly, in, the, presence, of, dissimilar, metals, aluminium, reacts, with, most, nonmetals, upon, heating, forming, compounds, such, as, aluminium, nitride, aln, aluminium, sulfide, al, 2, s, 3, and, the, aluminium, halides, alx, 3, it, also, forms, a, wide, range, of, intermetallic, compounds, involving, metals, from, every, group, on, the, periodic, table, the, vast, majority, of, compounds, including, all, aluminium, containing, minerals, and, all, commercially, significant, aluminium, compounds, feature, aluminium, in, the, oxidation, state, 3, the, coordination, number, of, such, compounds, varies, but, generally, al, 3, is, either, six, or, four, coordinate, almost, all, compounds, of, aluminium, iii, are, colorless, in, aqueous, solution, al, 3, exists, as, the, hexaaqua, cation, 3, which, has, an, approximate, k, a, of, 10, 5, such, solutions, are, acidic, as, this, cation, can, act, as, a, proton, donor, and, progressively, hydrolyze, until, a, precipitate, of, aluminium, hydroxide, al, oh, 3, forms, this, is, useful, for, clarification, of, water, as, the, precipitate, nucleates, on, suspended, particles, in, the, water, hence, removing, them, increasing, the, ph, even, further, leads, to, the, hydroxide, dissolving, again, as, aluminate, is, formed, aluminium, hydroxide, forms, both, salts, and, aluminates, and, dissolves, in, acid, and, alkali, as, well, as, on, fusion, with, acidic, and, basic, oxides, this, behavior, of, al, oh, 3, is, termed, amphoterism, and, is, characteristic, of, weakly, basic, cations, that, form, insoluble, hydroxides, and, whose, hydrated, species, can, also, donate, their, protons, one, effect, of, this, is, that, aluminium, salts, with, weak, acids, are, hydrolyzed, in, water, to, the, aquated, hydroxide, and, the, corresponding, nonmetal, hydride, for, example, aluminium, sulfide, yields, hydrogen, sulfide, however, some, salts, like, aluminium, carbonate, exist, in, aqueous, solution, but, are, unstable, as, such, and, only, incomplete, hydrolysis, takes, place, for, salts, with, strong, acids, such, as, the, halides, nitrate, and, sulfate, for, similar, reasons, anhydrous, aluminium, salts, cannot, be, made, by, heating, their, hydrates, hydrated, aluminium, chloride, is, in, fact, not, alcl, 3, 6h, 2, o, but, cl, 3, and, the, al, o, bonds, are, so, strong, that, heating, is, not, sufficient, to, break, them, and, form, al, cl, bonds, instead, all, four, trihalides, are, well, known, unlike, the, structures, of, the, three, heavier, trihalides, aluminium, fluoride, alf, 3, features, six, coordinate, aluminium, which, explains, its, involatility, and, insolubility, as, well, as, high, heat, of, formation, each, aluminium, atom, is, surrounded, by, six, fluorine, atoms, in, a, distorted, octahedral, arrangement, with, each, fluorine, atom, being, shared, between, the, corners, of, two, octahedra, such, alf, 6, units, also, exist, in, complex, fluorides, such, as, cryolite, na, 3, alf, 6, alf, 3, melts, at, 1, 290, c, 2, 354, f, and, is, made, by, reaction, of, aluminium, oxide, with, hydrogen, fluoride, gas, at, 700, c, 1, 300, f, with, heavier, halides, the, coordination, numbers, are, lower, the, other, trihalides, are, dimeric, or, polymeric, with, tetrahedral, four, coordinate, aluminium, centers, aluminium, trichloride, alcl, 3, has, a, layered, polymeric, structure, below, its, melting, point, of, 192, 4, c, 378, f, but, transforms, on, melting, to, al, 2, cl, 6, dimers, at, higher, temperatures, those, increasingly, dissociate, into, trigonal, planar, alcl, 3, monomers, similar, to, the, structure, of, bcl, 3, aluminium, tribromide, and, aluminium, triiodide, form, al, 2, x, 6, dimers, in, all, three, phases, and, hence, do, not, show, such, significant, changes, of, properties, upon, phase, change, these, materials, are, prepared, by, treating, aluminium, with, the, halogen, the, aluminium, trihalides, form, many, addition, compounds, or, complexes, their, lewis, acidic, nature, makes, them, useful, as, catalysts, for, the, friedel, crafts, reactions, aluminium, trichloride, has, major, industrial, uses, involving, this, reaction, such, as, in, the, manufacture, of, anthraquinones, and, styrene, it, is, also, often, used, as, the, precursor, for, many, other, aluminium, compounds, and, as, a, reagent, for, converting, nonmetal, fluorides, into, the, corresponding, chlorides, a, transhalogenation, reaction, aluminium, forms, one, stable, oxide, with, the, chemical, formula, al, 2, o, 3, commonly, called, alumina, it, can, be, found, in, nature, in, the, mineral, corundum, alumina, there, is, also, a, alumina, phase, its, crystalline, form, corundum, is, very, hard, mohs, hardness, 9, has, a, high, melting, point, of, 2, 045, c, 3, 713, f, has, very, low, volatility, is, chemically, inert, and, a, good, electrical, insulator, it, is, often, used, in, abrasives, such, as, toothpaste, as, a, refractory, material, and, in, ceramics, as, well, as, being, the, starting, material, for, the, electrolytic, production, of, aluminium, sapphire, and, ruby, are, impure, corundum, contaminated, with, trace, amounts, of, other, metals, the, two, main, oxide, hydroxides, alo, oh, are, boehmite, and, diaspore, there, are, three, main, trihydroxides, bayerite, gibbsite, and, nordstrandite, which, differ, in, their, crystalline, structure, polymorphs, many, other, intermediate, and, related, structures, are, also, known, most, are, produced, from, ores, by, a, variety, of, wet, processes, using, acid, and, base, heating, the, hydroxides, leads, to, formation, of, corundum, these, materials, are, of, central, importance, to, the, production, of, aluminium, and, are, themselves, extremely, useful, some, mixed, oxide, phases, are, also, very, useful, such, as, spinel, mgal, 2, o, 4, na, alumina, naal, 11, o, 17, and, tricalcium, aluminate, ca, 3, al, 2, o, 6, an, important, mineral, phase, in, portland, cement, the, only, stable, chalcogenides, under, normal, conditions, are, aluminium, sulfide, al, 2, s, 3, selenide, al, 2, se, 3, and, telluride, al, 2, te, 3, all, three, are, prepared, by, direct, reaction, of, their, elements, at, about, 1, 000, c, 1, 800, f, and, quickly, hydrolyze, completely, in, water, to, yield, aluminium, hydroxide, and, the, respective, hydrogen, chalcogenide, as, aluminium, is, a, small, atom, relative, to, these, chalcogens, these, have, four, coordinate, tetrahedral, aluminium, with, various, polymorphs, having, structures, related, to, wurtzite, with, two, thirds, of, the, possible, metal, sites, occupied, either, in, an, orderly, or, random, fashion, the, sulfide, also, has, a, form, related, to, alumina, and, an, unusual, high, temperature, hexagonal, form, where, half, the, aluminium, atoms, have, tetrahedral, four, coordination, and, the, other, half, have, trigonal, bipyramidal, five, coordination, four, pnictides, aluminium, nitride, aln, aluminium, phosphide, alp, aluminium, arsenide, alas, and, aluminium, antimonide, alsb, are, known, they, are, all, iii, v, semiconductors, isoelectronic, to, silicon, and, germanium, all, of, which, but, aln, have, the, zinc, blende, structure, all, four, can, be, made, by, high, temperature, and, possibly, high, pressure, direct, reaction, of, their, component, elements, aluminium, alloys, well, with, most, other, metals, with, the, exception, of, most, alkali, metals, and, group, 13, metals, and, over, 150, intermetallics, with, other, metals, are, known, preparation, involves, heating, fixed, metals, together, in, certain, proportion, followed, by, gradual, cooling, and, annealing, bonding, in, them, is, predominantly, metallic, and, the, crystal, structure, primarily, depends, on, efficiency, of, packing, there, are, few, compounds, with, lower, oxidation, states, a, few, aluminium, i, compounds, exist, alf, alcl, albr, and, ali, exist, in, the, gaseous, phase, when, the, respective, trihalide, is, heated, with, aluminium, and, at, cryogenic, temperatures, a, stable, derivative, of, aluminium, monoiodide, is, the, cyclic, adduct, formed, with, triethylamine, al, 4, i, 4, net, 3, 4, al, 2, o, and, al, 2, s, also, exist, but, are, very, unstable, very, simple, aluminium, ii, compounds, are, invoked, or, observed, in, the, reactions, of, al, metal, with, oxidants, for, example, aluminium, monoxide, alo, has, been, detected, in, the, gas, phase, after, explosion, and, in, stellar, absorption, spectra, more, thoroughly, investigated, are, compounds, of, the, formula, r, 4, al, 2, which, contain, an, al, al, bond, and, where, r, is, a, large, organic, ligand, a, variety, of, compounds, of, empirical, formula, alr, 3, and, alr, 1, 5, cl, 1, 5, exist, the, aluminium, trialkyls, and, triaryls, are, reactive, volatile, and, colorless, liquids, or, low, melting, solids, they, catch, fire, spontaneously, in, air, and, react, with, water, thus, necessitating, precautions, when, handling, them, they, often, form, dimers, unlike, their, boron, analogues, but, this, tendency, diminishes, for, branched, chain, alkyls, e, g, pr, i, bu, i, me, 3, cch, 2, for, example, triisobutylaluminium, exists, as, an, equilibrium, mixture, of, the, monomer, and, dimer, these, dimers, such, as, trimethylaluminium, al, 2, me, 6, usually, feature, tetrahedral, al, centers, formed, by, dimerization, with, some, alkyl, group, bridging, between, both, aluminium, atoms, they, are, hard, acids, and, react, readily, with, ligands, forming, adducts, in, industry, they, are, mostly, used, in, alkene, insertion, reactions, as, discovered, by, karl, ziegler, most, importantly, in, growth, reactions, that, form, long, chain, unbranched, primary, alkenes, and, alcohols, and, in, the, low, pressure, polymerization, of, ethene, and, propene, there, are, also, some, heterocyclic, and, cluster, organoaluminium, compounds, involving, al, n, bonds, the, industrially, most, important, aluminium, hydride, is, lithium, aluminium, hydride, lialh, 4, which, is, used, as, a, reducing, agent, in, organic, chemistry, it, can, be, produced, from, lithium, hydride, and, aluminium, trichloride, the, simplest, hydride, aluminium, hydride, or, alane, is, not, as, important, it, is, a, polymer, with, the, formula, alh, 3, n, in, contrast, to, the, corresponding, boron, hydride, that, is, a, dimer, with, the, formula, bh, 3, 2, aluminium, s, per, particle, abundance, in, the, solar, system, is, 3, 15, ppm, parts, per, million, it, is, the, twelfth, most, abundant, of, all, elements, and, third, most, abundant, among, the, elements, that, have, odd, atomic, numbers, after, hydrogen, and, nitrogen, the, only, stable, isotope, of, aluminium, 27, al, is, the, eighteenth, most, abundant, nucleus, in, the, universe, it, is, created, almost, entirely, after, fusion, of, carbon, in, massive, stars, that, will, later, become, type, ii, supernovas, this, fusion, creates, 26, mg, which, upon, capturing, free, protons, and, neutrons, becomes, aluminium, some, smaller, quantities, of, 27, al, are, created, in, hydrogen, burning, shells, of, evolved, stars, where, 26, mg, can, capture, free, protons, essentially, all, aluminium, now, in, existence, is, 27, al, 26, al, was, present, in, the, early, solar, system, with, abundance, of, 0, 005, relative, to, 27, al, but, its, half, life, of, 728, 000, years, is, too, short, for, any, original, nuclei, to, survive, 26, al, is, therefore, extinct, unlike, for, 27, al, hydrogen, burning, is, the, primary, source, of, 26, al, with, the, nuclide, emerging, after, a, nucleus, of, 25, mg, catches, a, free, proton, however, the, trace, quantities, of, 26, al, that, do, exist, are, the, most, common, gamma, ray, emitter, in, the, interstellar, gas, if, the, original, 26, al, were, still, present, gamma, ray, maps, of, the, milky, way, would, be, brighter, overall, the, earth, is, about, 1, 59, aluminium, by, mass, seventh, in, abundance, by, mass, aluminium, occurs, in, greater, proportion, in, the, earth, s, crust, than, in, the, universe, at, large, this, is, because, aluminium, easily, forms, the, oxide, and, becomes, bound, into, rocks, and, stays, in, the, earth, s, crust, while, less, reactive, metals, sink, to, the, core, in, the, earth, s, crust, aluminium, is, the, most, abundant, metallic, element, 8, 23, by, mass, and, the, third, most, abundant, of, all, elements, after, oxygen, and, silicon, a, large, number, of, silicates, in, the, earth, s, crust, contain, aluminium, in, contrast, the, earth, s, mantle, is, only, 2, 38, aluminium, by, mass, aluminium, also, occurs, in, seawater, at, a, concentration, of, 2, g, kg, because, of, its, strong, affinity, for, oxygen, aluminium, is, almost, never, found, in, the, elemental, state, instead, it, is, found, in, oxides, or, silicates, feldspars, the, most, common, group, of, minerals, in, the, earth, s, crust, are, aluminosilicates, aluminium, also, occurs, in, the, minerals, beryl, cryolite, garnet, spinel, and, turquoise, impurities, in, al, 2, o, 3, such, as, chromium, and, iron, yield, the, gemstones, ruby, and, sapphire, respectively, native, aluminium, metal, is, extremely, rare, and, can, only, be, found, as, a, minor, phase, in, low, oxygen, fugacity, environments, such, as, the, interiors, of, certain, volcanoes, native, aluminium, has, been, reported, in, cold, seeps, in, the, northeastern, continental, slope, of, the, south, china, sea, it, is, possible, that, these, deposits, resulted, from, bacterial, reduction, of, tetrahydroxoaluminate, al, oh, 4, although, aluminium, is, a, common, and, widespread, element, not, all, aluminium, minerals, are, economically, viable, sources, of, the, metal, almost, all, metallic, aluminium, is, produced, from, the, ore, bauxite, alo, x, oh, 3, 2, x, bauxite, occurs, as, a, weathering, product, of, low, iron, and, silica, bedrock, in, tropical, climatic, conditions, in, 2017, most, bauxite, was, mined, in, australia, china, guinea, and, india, the, history, of, aluminium, has, been, shaped, by, usage, of, alum, the, first, written, record, of, alum, made, by, greek, historian, herodotus, dates, back, to, the, 5th, century, bce, the, ancients, are, known, to, have, used, alum, as, a, dyeing, mordant, and, for, city, defense, after, the, crusades, alum, an, indispensable, good, in, the, european, fabric, industry, was, a, subject, of, international, commerce, it, was, imported, to, europe, from, the, eastern, mediterranean, until, the, mid, 15th, century, the, nature, of, alum, remained, unknown, around, 1530, swiss, physician, paracelsus, suggested, alum, was, a, salt, of, an, earth, of, alum, in, 1595, german, doctor, and, chemist, andreas, libavius, experimentally, confirmed, this, in, 1722, german, chemist, friedrich, hoffmann, announced, his, belief, that, the, base, of, alum, was, a, distinct, earth, in, 1754, german, chemist, andreas, sigismund, marggraf, synthesized, alumina, by, boiling, clay, in, sulfuric, acid, and, subsequently, adding, potash, attempts, to, produce, aluminium, date, back, to, 1760, the, first, successful, attempt, however, was, completed, in, 1824, by, danish, physicist, and, chemist, hans, christian, rsted, he, reacted, anhydrous, aluminium, chloride, with, potassium, amalgam, yielding, a, lump, of, metal, looking, similar, to, tin, he, presented, his, results, and, demonstrated, a, sample, of, the, new, metal, in, 1825, in, 1827, german, chemist, friedrich, w, hler, repeated, rsted, s, experiments, but, did, not, identify, any, aluminium, the, reason, for, this, inconsistency, was, only, discovered, in, 1921, he, conducted, a, similar, experiment, in, the, same, year, by, mixing, anhydrous, aluminium, chloride, with, potassium, and, produced, a, powder, of, aluminium, in, 1845, he, was, able, to, produce, small, pieces, of, the, metal, and, described, some, physical, properties, of, this, metal, for, many, years, thereafter, w, hler, was, credited, as, the, discoverer, of, aluminium, as, w, hler, s, method, could, not, yield, great, quantities, of, aluminium, the, metal, remained, rare, its, cost, exceeded, that, of, gold, the, first, industrial, production, of, aluminium, was, established, in, 1856, by, french, chemist, henri, etienne, sainte, claire, deville, and, companions, deville, had, discovered, that, aluminium, trichloride, could, be, reduced, by, sodium, which, was, more, convenient, and, less, expensive, than, potassium, which, w, hler, had, used, even, then, aluminium, was, still, not, of, great, purity, and, produced, aluminium, differed, in, properties, by, sample, because, of, its, electricity, conducting, capacity, aluminium, was, used, as, the, cap, of, the, washington, monument, completed, in, 1885, the, tallest, building, in, the, world, at, the, time, the, non, corroding, metal, cap, was, intended, to, serve, as, a, lightning, rod, peak, the, first, industrial, large, scale, production, method, was, independently, developed, in, 1886, by, french, engineer, paul, h, roult, and, american, engineer, charles, martin, hall, it, is, now, known, as, the, hall, h, roult, process, the, hall, h, roult, process, converts, alumina, into, metal, austrian, chemist, carl, joseph, bayer, discovered, a, way, of, purifying, bauxite, to, yield, alumina, now, known, as, the, bayer, process, in, 1889, modern, production, of, aluminium, is, based, on, the, bayer, and, hall, h, roult, processes, as, large, scale, production, caused, aluminium, prices, to, drop, the, metal, became, widely, used, in, jewelry, eyeglass, frames, optical, instruments, tableware, and, foil, and, other, everyday, items, in, the, 1890s, and, early, 20th, century, aluminium, s, ability, to, form, hard, yet, light, alloys, with, other, metals, provided, the, metal, with, many, uses, at, the, time, during, world, war, i, major, governments, demanded, large, shipments, of, aluminium, for, light, strong, airframes, during, world, war, ii, demand, by, major, governments, for, aviation, was, even, higher, by, the, mid, 20th, century, aluminium, had, become, a, part, of, everyday, life, and, an, essential, component, of, housewares, in, 1954, production, of, aluminium, surpassed, that, of, copper, historically, second, in, production, only, to, iron, making, it, the, most, produced, non, ferrous, metal, during, the, mid, 20th, century, aluminium, emerged, as, a, civil, engineering, material, with, building, applications, in, both, basic, construction, and, interior, finish, work, and, increasingly, being, used, in, military, engineering, for, both, airplanes, and, land, armor, vehicle, engines, earth, s, first, artificial, satellite, launched, in, 1957, consisted, of, two, separate, aluminium, semi, spheres, joined, and, all, subsequent, space, vehicles, have, used, aluminium, to, some, extent, the, aluminium, can, was, invented, in, 1956, and, employed, as, a, storage, for, drinks, in, 1958, throughout, the, 20th, century, the, production, of, aluminium, rose, rapidly, while, the, world, production, of, aluminium, in, 1900, was, 6, 800, metric, tons, the, annual, production, first, exceeded, 100, 000, metric, tons, in, 1916, 1, 000, 000, tons, in, 1941, 10, 000, 000, tons, in, 1971, in, the, 1970s, the, increased, demand, for, aluminium, made, it, an, exchange, commodity, it, entered, the, london, metal, exchange, the, oldest, industrial, metal, exchange, in, the, world, in, 1978, the, output, continued, to, grow, the, annual, production, of, aluminium, exceeded, 50, 000, 000, metric, tons, in, 2013, the, real, price, for, aluminium, declined, from, 14, 000, per, metric, ton, in, 1900, to, 2, 340, in, 1948, in, 1998, united, states, dollars, extraction, and, processing, costs, were, lowered, over, technological, progress, and, the, scale, of, the, economies, however, the, need, to, exploit, lower, grade, poorer, quality, deposits, and, the, use, of, fast, increasing, input, costs, above, all, energy, increased, the, net, cost, of, aluminium, the, real, price, began, to, grow, in, the, 1970s, with, the, rise, of, energy, cost, production, moved, from, the, industrialized, countries, to, countries, where, production, was, cheaper, production, costs, in, the, late, 20th, century, changed, because, of, advances, in, technology, lower, energy, prices, exchange, rates, of, the, united, states, dollar, and, alumina, prices, the, bric, countries, combined, share, in, primary, production, and, primary, consumption, grew, substantially, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 21st, century, china, is, accumulating, an, especially, large, share, of, the, world, s, production, thanks, to, an, abundance, of, resources, cheap, energy, and, governmental, stimuli, it, also, increased, its, consumption, share, from, 2, in, 1972, to, 40, in, 2010, in, the, united, states, western, europe, and, japan, most, aluminium, was, consumed, in, transportation, engineering, construction, and, packaging, in, 2021, prices, for, industrial, metals, such, as, aluminium, have, soared, to, near, record, levels, as, energy, shortages, in, china, drive, up, costs, for, electricity, the, names, aluminium, and, aluminum, are, derived, from, the, word, alumine, an, obsolete, term, for, alumina, the, primary, naturally, occurring, oxide, of, aluminium, alumine, was, borrowed, from, french, which, in, turn, derived, it, from, alumen, the, classical, latin, name, for, alum, the, mineral, from, which, it, was, collected, the, latin, word, alumen, stems, from, the, proto, indo, european, root, alu, meaning, bitter, or, beer, british, chemist, humphry, davy, who, performed, a, number, of, experiments, aimed, to, isolate, the, metal, is, credited, as, the, person, who, named, the, element, the, first, name, proposed, for, the, metal, to, be, isolated, from, alum, was, alumium, which, davy, suggested, in, an, 1808, article, on, his, electrochemical, research, published, in, philosophical, transactions, of, the, royal, society, it, appeared, that, the, name, was, created, from, the, english, word, alum, and, the, latin, suffix, ium, but, it, was, customary, then, to, give, elements, names, originating, in, latin, so, this, name, was, not, adopted, universally, this, name, was, criticized, by, contemporary, chemists, from, france, germany, and, sweden, who, insisted, the, metal, should, be, named, for, the, oxide, alumina, from, which, it, would, be, isolated, the, english, name, alum, does, not, come, directly, from, latin, whereas, alumine, alumina, obviously, comes, from, the, latin, word, alumen, upon, declension, alumen, changes, to, alumin, one, example, was, essai, sur, la, nomenclature, chimique, july, 1811, written, in, french, by, a, swedish, chemist, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, in, which, the, name, aluminium, is, given, to, the, element, that, would, be, synthesized, from, alum, another, article, in, the, same, journal, issue, also, refers, to, the, metal, whose, oxide, is, the, basis, of, sapphire, i, e, the, same, metal, as, to, aluminium, a, january, 1811, summary, of, one, of, davy, s, lectures, at, the, royal, society, mentioned, the, name, aluminium, as, a, possibility, the, next, year, davy, published, a, chemistry, textbook, in, which, he, used, the, spelling, aluminum, both, spellings, have, coexisted, since, their, usage, is, currently, regional, aluminum, dominates, in, the, united, states, and, canada, aluminium, is, prevalent, in, the, rest, of, the, english, speaking, world, in, 1812, british, scientist, thomas, young, wrote, an, anonymous, review, of, davy, s, book, in, which, he, proposed, the, name, aluminium, instead, of, aluminum, which, he, thought, had, a, less, classical, sound, this, name, persisted, although, the, um, spelling, was, occasionally, used, in, britain, the, american, scientific, language, used, ium, from, the, start, most, scientists, throughout, the, world, used, ium, in, the, 19th, century, and, it, was, entrenched, in, several, other, european, languages, such, as, french, german, and, dutch, in, 1828, an, american, lexicographer, noah, webster, entered, only, the, aluminum, spelling, in, his, american, dictionary, of, the, english, language, in, the, 1830s, the, um, spelling, gained, usage, in, the, united, states, by, the, 1860s, it, had, become, the, more, common, spelling, there, outside, science, in, 1892, hall, used, the, um, spelling, in, his, advertising, handbill, for, his, new, electrolytic, method, of, producing, the, metal, despite, his, constant, use, of, the, ium, spelling, in, all, the, patents, he, filed, between, 1886, and, 1903, it, is, unknown, whether, this, spelling, was, introduced, by, mistake, or, intentionally, but, hall, preferred, aluminum, since, its, introduction, because, it, resembled, platinum, the, name, of, a, prestigious, metal, by, 1890, both, spellings, had, been, common, in, the, united, states, the, ium, spelling, being, slightly, more, common, by, 1895, the, situation, had, reversed, by, 1900, aluminum, had, become, twice, as, common, as, aluminium, in, the, next, decade, the, um, spelling, dominated, american, usage, in, 1925, the, american, chemical, society, adopted, this, spelling, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, iupac, adopted, aluminium, as, the, standard, international, name, for, the, element, in, 1990, in, 1993, they, recognized, aluminum, as, an, acceptable, variant, the, most, recent, 2005, edition, of, the, iupac, nomenclature, of, inorganic, chemistry, also, acknowledges, this, spelling, iupac, official, publications, use, the, ium, spelling, as, primary, and, they, list, both, where, it, is, appropriate, the, production, of, aluminium, starts, with, the, extraction, of, bauxite, rock, from, the, ground, the, bauxite, is, processed, and, transformed, using, the, bayer, process, into, alumina, which, is, then, processed, using, the, hall, h, roult, process, resulting, in, the, final, aluminium, aluminium, production, is, highly, energy, consuming, and, so, the, producers, tend, to, locate, smelters, in, places, where, electric, power, is, both, plentiful, and, inexpensive, production, of, one, kilogram, of, aluminium, requires, 7, kilograms, of, oil, energy, equivalent, as, compared, to, 1, 5, kilograms, for, steel, and, 2, kilograms, for, plastic, as, of, 2019, the, world, s, largest, smelters, of, aluminium, are, located, in, china, india, russia, canada, and, the, united, arab, emirates, while, china, is, by, far, the, top, producer, of, aluminium, with, a, world, share, of, fifty, five, percent, according, to, the, international, resource, panel, s, metal, stocks, in, society, report, the, global, per, capita, stock, of, aluminium, in, use, in, society, i, e, in, cars, buildings, electronics, etc, is, 80, kg, 180, lb, much, of, this, is, in, more, developed, countries, 350, 500, kg, 770, 1, 100, lb, per, capita, rather, than, less, developed, countries, 35, kg, 77, lb, per, capita, bauxite, is, converted, to, alumina, by, the, bayer, process, bauxite, is, blended, for, uniform, composition, and, then, is, ground, the, resulting, slurry, is, mixed, with, a, hot, solution, of, sodium, hydroxide, the, mixture, is, then, treated, in, a, digester, vessel, at, a, pressure, well, above, atmospheric, dissolving, the, aluminium, hydroxide, in, bauxite, while, converting, impurities, into, relatively, insoluble, compounds, after, this, reaction, the, slurry, is, at, a, temperature, above, its, atmospheric, boiling, point, it, is, cooled, by, removing, steam, as, pressure, is, reduced, the, bauxite, residue, is, separated, from, the, solution, and, discarded, the, solution, free, of, solids, is, seeded, with, small, crystals, of, aluminium, hydroxide, this, causes, decomposition, of, the, ions, to, aluminium, hydroxide, after, about, half, of, aluminium, has, precipitated, the, mixture, is, sent, to, classifiers, small, crystals, of, aluminium, hydroxide, are, collected, to, serve, as, seeding, agents, coarse, particles, are, converted, to, alumina, by, heating, the, excess, solution, is, removed, by, evaporation, if, needed, purified, and, recycled, the, conversion, of, alumina, to, aluminium, is, achieved, by, the, hall, h, roult, process, in, this, energy, intensive, process, a, solution, of, alumina, in, a, molten, 950, and, 980, c, 1, 740, and, 1, 800, f, mixture, of, cryolite, na, 3, alf, 6, with, calcium, fluoride, is, electrolyzed, to, produce, metallic, aluminium, the, liquid, aluminium, sinks, to, the, bottom, of, the, solution, and, is, tapped, off, and, usually, cast, into, large, blocks, called, aluminium, billets, for, further, processing, anodes, of, the, electrolysis, cell, are, made, of, carbon, the, most, resistant, material, against, fluoride, corrosion, and, either, bake, at, the, process, or, are, prebaked, the, former, also, called, s, derberg, anodes, are, less, power, efficient, and, fumes, released, during, baking, are, costly, to, collect, which, is, why, they, are, being, replaced, by, prebaked, anodes, even, though, they, save, the, power, energy, and, labor, to, prebake, the, cathodes, carbon, for, anodes, should, be, preferably, pure, so, that, neither, aluminium, nor, the, electrolyte, is, contaminated, with, ash, despite, carbon, s, resistivity, against, corrosion, it, is, still, consumed, at, a, rate, of, 0, 4, 0, 5, kg, per, each, kilogram, of, produced, aluminium, cathodes, are, made, of, anthracite, high, purity, for, them, is, not, required, because, impurities, leach, only, very, slowly, the, cathode, is, consumed, at, a, rate, of, 0, 02, 0, 04, kg, per, each, kilogram, of, produced, aluminium, a, cell, is, usually, terminated, after, 2, 6, years, following, a, failure, of, the, cathode, the, hall, heroult, process, produces, aluminium, with, a, purity, of, above, 99, further, purification, can, be, done, by, the, hoopes, process, this, process, involves, the, electrolysis, of, molten, aluminium, with, a, sodium, barium, and, aluminium, fluoride, electrolyte, the, resulting, aluminium, has, a, purity, of, 99, 99, electric, power, represents, about, 20, to, 40, of, the, cost, of, producing, aluminium, depending, on, the, location, of, the, smelter, aluminium, production, consumes, roughly, 5, of, electricity, generated, in, the, united, states, because, of, this, alternatives, to, the, hall, h, roult, process, have, been, researched, but, none, has, turned, out, to, be, economically, feasible, recovery, of, the, metal, through, recycling, has, become, an, important, task, of, the, aluminium, industry, recycling, was, a, low, profile, activity, until, the, late, 1960s, when, the, growing, use, of, aluminium, beverage, cans, brought, it, to, public, awareness, recycling, involves, melting, the, scrap, a, process, that, requires, only, 5, of, the, energy, used, to, produce, aluminium, from, ore, though, a, significant, part, up, to, 15, of, the, input, material, is, lost, as, dross, ash, like, oxide, an, aluminium, stack, melter, produces, significantly, less, dross, with, values, reported, below, 1, white, dross, from, primary, aluminium, production, and, from, secondary, recycling, operations, still, contains, useful, quantities, of, aluminium, that, can, be, extracted, industrially, the, process, produces, aluminium, billets, together, with, a, highly, complex, waste, material, this, waste, is, difficult, to, manage, it, reacts, with, water, releasing, a, mixture, of, gases, including, among, others, hydrogen, acetylene, and, ammonia, which, spontaneously, ignites, on, contact, with, air, contact, with, damp, air, results, in, the, release, of, copious, quantities, of, ammonia, gas, despite, these, difficulties, the, waste, is, used, as, a, filler, in, asphalt, and, concrete, the, global, production, of, aluminium, in, 2016, was, 58, 8, million, metric, tons, it, exceeded, that, of, any, other, metal, except, iron, 1, 231, million, metric, tons, aluminium, is, almost, always, alloyed, which, markedly, improves, its, mechanical, properties, especially, when, tempered, for, example, the, common, aluminium, foils, and, beverage, cans, are, alloys, of, 92, to, 99, aluminium, the, main, alloying, agents, are, copper, zinc, magnesium, manganese, and, silicon, e, g, duralumin, with, the, levels, of, other, metals, in, a, few, percent, by, weight, aluminium, both, wrought, and, cast, has, been, alloyed, with, manganese, silicon, magnesium, copper, and, zinc, among, others, the, major, uses, for, aluminium, are, in, the, great, majority, about, 90, of, aluminium, oxide, is, converted, to, metallic, aluminium, being, a, very, hard, material, mohs, hardness, 9, alumina, is, widely, used, as, an, abrasive, being, extraordinarily, chemically, inert, it, is, useful, in, highly, reactive, environments, such, as, high, pressure, sodium, lamps, aluminium, oxide, is, commonly, used, as, a, catalyst, for, industrial, processes, e, g, the, claus, process, to, convert, hydrogen, sulfide, to, sulfur, in, refineries, and, to, alkylate, amines, many, industrial, catalysts, are, supported, by, alumina, meaning, that, the, expensive, catalyst, material, is, dispersed, over, a, surface, of, the, inert, alumina, another, principal, use, is, as, a, drying, agent, or, absorbent, several, sulfates, of, aluminium, have, industrial, and, commercial, application, aluminium, sulfate, in, its, hydrate, form, is, produced, on, the, annual, scale, of, several, millions, of, metric, tons, about, two, thirds, is, consumed, in, water, treatment, the, next, major, application, is, in, the, manufacture, of, paper, it, is, also, used, as, a, mordant, in, dyeing, in, pickling, seeds, deodorizing, of, mineral, oils, in, leather, tanning, and, in, production, of, other, aluminium, compounds, two, kinds, of, alum, ammonium, alum, and, potassium, alum, were, formerly, used, as, mordants, and, in, leather, tanning, but, their, use, has, significantly, declined, following, availability, of, high, purity, aluminium, sulfate, anhydrous, aluminium, chloride, is, used, as, a, catalyst, in, chemical, and, petrochemical, industries, the, dyeing, industry, and, in, synthesis, of, various, inorganic, and, organic, compounds, aluminium, hydroxychlorides, are, used, in, purifying, water, in, the, paper, industry, and, as, antiperspirants, sodium, aluminate, is, used, in, treating, water, and, as, an, accelerator, of, solidification, of, cement, many, aluminium, compounds, have, niche, applications, for, example, despite, its, widespread, occurrence, in, the, earth, s, crust, aluminium, has, no, known, function, in, biology, at, ph, 6, 9, relevant, for, most, natural, waters, aluminium, precipitates, out, of, water, as, the, hydroxide, and, is, hence, not, available, most, elements, behaving, this, way, have, no, biological, role, or, are, toxic, aluminium, sulfate, has, an, ld, 50, of, 6207, mg, kg, oral, mouse, which, corresponds, to, 435, grams, about, one, pound, for, a, 70, kg, 150, lb, mouse, aluminium, is, classified, as, a, non, carcinogen, by, the, united, states, department, of, health, and, human, services, a, review, published, in, 1988, said, that, there, was, little, evidence, that, normal, exposure, to, aluminium, presents, a, risk, to, healthy, adult, and, a, 2014, multi, element, toxicology, review, was, unable, to, find, deleterious, effects, of, aluminium, consumed, in, amounts, not, greater, than, 40, mg, day, per, kg, of, body, mass, most, aluminium, consumed, will, leave, the, body, in, feces, most, of, the, small, part, of, it, that, enters, the, bloodstream, will, be, excreted, via, urine, nevertheless, some, aluminium, does, pass, the, blood, brain, barrier, and, is, lodged, preferentially, in, the, brains, of, alzheimer, s, patients, evidence, published, in, 1989, indicates, that, for, alzheimer, s, patients, aluminium, may, act, by, electrostatically, crosslinking, proteins, thus, down, regulating, genes, in, the, superior, temporal, gyrus, aluminium, although, rarely, can, cause, vitamin, d, resistant, osteomalacia, erythropoietin, resistant, microcytic, anemia, and, central, nervous, system, alterations, people, with, kidney, insufficiency, are, especially, at, a, risk, chronic, ingestion, of, hydrated, aluminium, silicates, for, excess, gastric, acidity, control, may, result, in, aluminium, binding, to, intestinal, contents, and, increased, elimination, of, other, metals, such, as, iron, or, zinc, sufficiently, high, doses, 50, g, day, can, cause, anemia, during, the, 1988, camelford, water, pollution, incident, people, in, camelford, had, their, drinking, water, contaminated, with, aluminium, sulfate, for, several, weeks, a, final, report, into, the, incident, in, 2013, concluded, it, was, unlikely, that, this, had, caused, long, term, health, problems, aluminium, has, been, suspected, of, being, a, possible, cause, of, alzheimer, s, disease, but, research, into, this, for, over, 40, years, has, found, as, of, 2018, no, good, evidence, of, causal, effect, aluminium, increases, estrogen, related, gene, expression, in, human, breast, cancer, cells, cultured, in, the, laboratory, in, very, high, doses, aluminium, is, associated, with, altered, function, of, the, blood, brain, barrier, a, small, percentage, of, people, have, contact, allergies, to, aluminium, and, experience, itchy, red, rashes, headache, muscle, pain, joint, pain, poor, memory, insomnia, depression, asthma, irritable, bowel, syndrome, or, other, symptoms, upon, contact, with, products, containing, aluminium, exposure, to, powdered, aluminium, or, aluminium, welding, fumes, can, cause, pulmonary, fibrosis, fine, aluminium, powder, can, ignite, or, explode, posing, another, workplace, hazard, food, is, the, main, source, of, aluminium, drinking, water, contains, more, aluminium, than, solid, food, however, aluminium, in, food, may, be, absorbed, more, than, aluminium, from, water, major, sources, of, human, oral, exposure, to, aluminium, include, food, due, to, its, use, in, food, additives, food, and, beverage, packaging, and, cooking, utensils, drinking, water, due, to, its, use, in, municipal, water, treatment, and, aluminium, containing, medications, particularly, antacid, antiulcer, and, buffered, aspirin, formulations, dietary, exposure, in, europeans, averages, to, 0, 2, 1, 5, mg, kg, week, but, can, be, as, high, as, 2, 3, mg, kg, week, higher, exposure, levels, of, aluminium, are, mostly, limited, to, miners, aluminium, production, workers, and, dialysis, patients, consumption, of, antacids, antiperspirants, vaccines, and, cosmetics, provide, possible, routes, of, exposure, consumption, of, acidic, foods, or, liquids, with, aluminium, enhances, aluminium, absorption, and, maltol, has, been, shown, to, increase, the, accumulation, of, aluminium, in, nerve, and, bone, tissues, in, case, of, suspected, sudden, intake, of, a, large, amount, of, aluminium, the, only, treatment, is, deferoxamine, mesylate, which, may, be, given, to, help, eliminate, aluminium, from, the, body, by, chelation, therapy, however, this, should, be, applied, with, caution, as, this, reduces, not, only, aluminium, body, levels, but, also, those, of, other, metals, such, as, copper, or, iron, high, levels, of, aluminium, occur, near, mining, sites, small, amounts, of, aluminium, are, released, to, the, environment, at, coal, fired, power, plants, or, incinerators, aluminium, in, the, air, is, washed, out, by, the, rain, or, normally, settles, down, but, small, particles, of, aluminium, remain, in, the, air, for, a, long, time, acidic, precipitation, is, the, main, natural, factor, to, mobilize, aluminium, from, natural, sources, and, the, main, reason, for, the, environmental, effects, of, aluminium, however, the, main, factor, of, presence, of, aluminium, in, salt, and, freshwater, are, the, industrial, processes, that, also, release, aluminium, into, air, in, water, aluminium, acts, as, a, toxi, agent, on, gill, breathing, animals, such, as, fish, when, the, water, is, acidic, in, which, aluminium, may, precipitate, on, gills, which, causes, loss, of, plasma, and, hemolymph, ions, leading, to, osmoregulatory, failure, organic, complexes, of, aluminium, may, be, easily, absorbed, and, interfere, with, metabolism, in, mammals, and, birds, even, though, this, rarely, happens, in, practice, aluminium, is, primary, among, the, factors, that, reduce, plant, growth, on, acidic, soils, although, it, is, generally, harmless, to, plant, growth, in, ph, neutral, soils, in, acid, soils, the, concentration, of, toxic, al, 3, cations, increases, and, disturbs, root, growth, and, function, wheat, has, developed, a, tolerance, to, aluminium, releasing, organic, compounds, that, bind, to, harmful, aluminium, cations, sorghum, is, believed, to, have, the, same, tolerance, mechanism, aluminium, production, possesses, its, own, challenges, to, the, environment, on, each, step, of, the, production, process, the, major, challenge, is, the, greenhouse, gas, emissions, these, gases, result, from, electrical, consumption, of, the, smelters, and, the, byproducts, of, processing, the, most, potent, of, these, gases, are, perfluorocarbons, from, the, smelting, process, released, sulfur, dioxide, is, one, of, the, primary, precursors, of, acid, rain, biodegradation, of, metallic, aluminium, is, extremely, rare, most, aluminium, corroding, organisms, do, not, directly, attack, or, consume, the, aluminium, but, instead, produce, corrosive, wastes, the, fungus, geotrichum, candidum, can, consume, the, aluminium, in, compact, discs, the, bacterium, pseudomonas, aeruginosa, and, the, fungus, cladosporium, resinae, are, commonly, detected, in, aircraft, fuel, tanks, that, use, kerosene, based, fuels, not, avgas, and, laboratory, cultures, can, degrade, aluminium, the, french, chemists, have, given, a, new, name, to, this, pure, earth, alumine, in, french, and, alumina, in, latin, i, confess, i, do, not, like, this, alumina, origin, formed, within, english, by, derivation, etymons, alumine, n, ium, suffix, aluminum, n, etymology, french, alumine, l, b, guyton, de, morveau, 1782, observ, sur, la, physique, 19, 378, classical, latin, al, min, al, men, alum, n, 1, after, french,

alkali, and, earth, and, which, when, thrown, into, water, decomposed, it, with, great, violence, the, result, of, this, experiment, is, not, wholly, decisive, as, to, the, existence, of, what, might, be, called, aluminium, and, glucinium, aluminium, n, coexisted, with, its, synonym, aluminum, n, throughout, the, 19th, cent, from, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, cent, aluminum, gradually, became, the, predominant, form, in, north, america, it, was, adopted, as, the, official, name, of, the, metal, in, the, united, states, by, the, american, chemical, society, in, 1925, elsewhere, aluminum, was, gradually, superseded, by, aluminium, which, was, accepted, as, international, standard, by, iupac, in, 1990
