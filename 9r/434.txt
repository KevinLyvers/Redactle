actinium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, ac, and, atomic, number, 89, it, was, first, isolated, by, friedrich, oskar, giesel, in, 1902, who, gave, it, the, name, emanium, the, element, got, its, name, by, being, wrongly, identified, with, a, substance, andr, louis, debierne, found, in, 1899, and, called, actinium, the, actinide, series, a, set, of, 15, elements, between, actinium, and, lawrencium, in, the, periodic, table, are, named, for, the, first, member, actinium, together, with, polonium, radium, and, radon, actinium, was, one, of, the, first, non, primordial, radioactive, elements, to, be, isolated, a, soft, silvery, white, radioactive, metal, actinium, reacts, rapidly, with, oxygen, and, moisture, in, air, forming, a, white, coating, of, actinium, oxide, that, prevents, further, oxidation, as, with, most, lanthanides, and, many, actinides, actinium, assumes, oxidation, state, 3, in, nearly, all, its, chemical, compounds, actinium, is, found, only, in, traces, in, uranium, and, thorium, ores, as, the, isotope, 227, ac, which, decays, with, a, half, life, of, 21, 772, years, predominantly, emitting, beta, and, sometimes, alpha, particles, and, 228, ac, which, is, beta, active, with, a, half, life, of, 6, 15, hours, one, tonne, of, natural, uranium, in, ore, contains, about, 0, 2, milligrams, of, actinium, 227, and, one, tonne, of, thorium, contains, about, 5, nanograms, of, actinium, 228, the, close, similarity, of, physical, and, chemical, properties, of, actinium, and, lanthanum, makes, separation, of, actinium, from, the, ore, impractical, instead, the, element, is, prepared, in, milligram, amounts, by, the, neutron, irradiation, of, 226, ra, in, a, nuclear, reactor, owing, to, its, scarcity, high, price, and, radioactivity, actinium, has, no, significant, industrial, use, its, current, applications, include, a, neutron, source, and, an, agent, for, radiation, therapy, andr, louis, debierne, a, french, chemist, announced, the, discovery, of, a, new, element, in, 1899, he, separated, it, from, pitchblende, residues, left, by, marie, and, pierre, curie, after, they, had, extracted, radium, in, 1899, debierne, described, the, substance, as, similar, to, titanium, and, in, 1900, as, similar, to, thorium, friedrich, oskar, giesel, found, in, 1902, a, substance, similar, to, lanthanum, and, called, it, emanium, in, 1904, after, a, comparison, of, the, substances, half, lives, determined, by, debierne, harriet, brooks, in, 1904, and, otto, hahn, and, otto, sackur, in, 1905, debierne, s, chosen, name, for, the, new, element, was, retained, because, it, had, seniority, despite, the, contradicting, chemical, properties, he, claimed, for, the, element, at, different, times, articles, published, in, the, 1970s, and, later, suggest, that, debierne, s, results, published, in, 1904, conflict, with, those, reported, in, 1899, and, 1900, furthermore, the, now, known, chemistry, of, actinium, precludes, its, presence, as, anything, other, than, a, minor, constituent, of, debierne, s, 1899, and, 1900, results, in, fact, the, chemical, properties, he, reported, make, it, likely, that, he, had, instead, accidentally, identified, protactinium, which, would, not, be, discovered, for, another, fourteen, years, only, to, have, it, disappear, due, to, its, hydrolysis, and, adsorption, onto, his, laboratory, equipment, this, has, led, some, authors, to, advocate, that, giesel, alone, should, be, credited, with, the, discovery, a, less, confrontational, vision, of, scientific, discovery, is, proposed, by, adloff, he, suggests, that, hindsight, criticism, of, the, early, publications, should, be, mitigated, by, the, then, nascent, state, of, radiochemistry, highlighting, the, prudence, of, debierne, s, claims, in, the, original, papers, he, notes, that, nobody, can, contend, that, debierne, s, substance, did, not, contain, actinium, debierne, who, is, now, considered, by, the, vast, majority, of, historians, as, the, discoverer, lost, interest, in, the, element, and, left, the, topic, giesel, on, the, other, hand, can, rightfully, be, credited, with, the, first, preparation, of, radiochemically, pure, actinium, and, with, the, identification, of, its, atomic, number, 89, the, name, actinium, originates, from, the, ancient, greek, aktis, aktinos, meaning, beam, or, ray, its, symbol, ac, is, also, used, in, abbreviations, of, other, compounds, that, have, nothing, to, do, with, actinium, such, as, acetyl, acetate, and, sometimes, acetaldehyde, actinium, is, a, soft, silvery, white, radioactive, metallic, element, its, estimated, shear, modulus, is, similar, to, that, of, lead, owing, to, its, strong, radioactivity, actinium, glows, in, the, dark, with, a, pale, blue, light, which, originates, from, the, surrounding, air, ionized, by, the, emitted, energetic, particles, actinium, has, similar, chemical, properties, to, lanthanum, and, other, lanthanides, and, therefore, these, elements, are, difficult, to, separate, when, extracting, from, uranium, ores, solvent, extraction, and, ion, chromatography, are, commonly, used, for, the, separation, the, first, element, of, the, actinides, actinium, gave, the, set, its, name, much, as, lanthanum, had, done, for, the, lanthanides, the, actinides, are, much, more, diverse, than, the, lanthanides, and, therefore, it, was, not, until, 1945, that, the, most, significant, change, to, dmitri, mendeleev, s, periodic, table, since, the, recognition, of, the, lanthanides, the, introduction, of, the, actinides, was, generally, accepted, after, glenn, t, seaborg, s, research, on, the, transuranium, elements, although, it, had, been, proposed, as, early, as, 1892, by, british, chemist, henry, bassett, actinium, reacts, rapidly, with, oxygen, and, moisture, in, air, forming, a, white, coating, of, actinium, oxide, that, impedes, further, oxidation, as, with, most, lanthanides, and, actinides, actinium, exists, in, the, oxidation, state, 3, and, the, ac, 3, ions, are, colorless, in, solutions, the, oxidation, state, 3, originates, from, the, 6d, 1, 7s, 2, electronic, configuration, of, actinium, with, three, valence, electrons, that, are, easily, donated, to, give, the, stable, closed, shell, structure, of, the, noble, gas, radon, although, the, 5f, orbitals, are, unoccupied, in, an, actinium, atom, it, can, be, used, as, a, valence, orbital, in, actinium, complexes, and, hence, it, is, generally, considered, the, first, 5f, element, by, authors, working, on, it, ac, 3, is, the, largest, of, all, known, tripositive, ions, and, its, first, coordination, sphere, contains, approximately, 10, 9, 0, 5, water, molecules, due, to, actinium, s, intense, radioactivity, only, a, limited, number, of, actinium, compounds, are, known, these, include, acf, 3, accl, 3, acbr, 3, acof, acocl, acobr, ac, 2, s, 3, ac, 2, o, 3, acpo, 4, and, ac, no, 3, 3, they, all, contain, actinium, in, the, oxidation, state, 3, in, particular, the, lattice, constants, of, the, analogous, lanthanum, and, actinium, compounds, differ, by, only, a, few, percent, here, a, b, and, c, are, lattice, constants, no, is, space, group, number, and, z, is, the, number, of, formula, units, per, unit, cell, density, was, not, measured, directly, but, calculated, from, the, lattice, parameters, actinium, oxide, ac, 2, o, 3, can, be, obtained, by, heating, the, hydroxide, at, 500, c, 932, f, or, the, oxalate, at, 1, 100, c, 2, 010, f, in, vacuum, its, crystal, lattice, is, isotypic, with, the, oxides, of, most, trivalent, rare, earth, metals, actinium, trifluoride, can, be, produced, either, in, solution, or, in, solid, reaction, the, former, reaction, is, carried, out, at, room, temperature, by, adding, hydrofluoric, acid, to, a, solution, containing, actinium, ions, in, the, latter, method, actinium, metal, is, treated, with, hydrogen, fluoride, vapors, at, 700, c, 1, 292, f, in, an, all, platinum, setup, treating, actinium, trifluoride, with, ammonium, hydroxide, at, 900, 1, 000, c, 1, 650, 1, 830, f, yields, oxyfluoride, acof, whereas, lanthanum, oxyfluoride, can, be, easily, obtained, by, burning, lanthanum, trifluoride, in, air, at, 800, c, 1, 470, f, for, an, hour, similar, treatment, of, actinium, trifluoride, yields, no, acof, and, only, results, in, melting, of, the, initial, product, actinium, trichloride, is, obtained, by, reacting, actinium, hydroxide, or, oxalate, with, carbon, tetrachloride, vapors, at, temperatures, above, 960, c, 1, 760, f, similarly, to, the, oxyfluoride, actinium, oxychloride, can, be, prepared, by, hydrolyzing, actinium, trichloride, with, ammonium, hydroxide, at, 1, 000, c, 1, 830, f, however, in, contrast, to, the, oxyfluoride, the, oxychloride, could, well, be, synthesized, by, igniting, a, solution, of, actinium, trichloride, in, hydrochloric, acid, with, ammonia, reaction, of, aluminium, bromide, and, actinium, oxide, yields, actinium, tribromide, and, treating, it, with, ammonium, hydroxide, at, 500, c, 932, f, results, in, the, oxybromide, acobr, actinium, hydride, was, obtained, by, reduction, of, actinium, trichloride, with, potassium, at, 300, c, 572, f, and, its, structure, was, deduced, by, analogy, with, the, corresponding, lah, 2, hydride, the, source, of, hydrogen, in, the, reaction, was, uncertain, mixing, monosodium, phosphate, nah, 2, po, 4, with, a, solution, of, actinium, in, hydrochloric, acid, yields, white, colored, actinium, phosphate, hemihydrate, acpo, 4, 0, 5h, 2, o, and, heating, actinium, oxalate, with, hydrogen, sulfide, vapors, at, 1, 400, c, 2, 550, f, for, a, few, minutes, results, in, a, black, actinium, sulfide, ac, 2, s, 3, it, may, possibly, be, produced, by, acting, with, a, mixture, of, hydrogen, sulfide, and, carbon, disulfide, on, actinium, oxide, at, 1, 000, c, 1, 830, f, naturally, occurring, actinium, is, principally, composed, of, two, radioactive, isotopes, 227, ac, from, the, radioactive, family, of, 235, u, and, 228, ac, a, granddaughter, of, 232, th, 227, ac, decays, mainly, as, a, beta, emitter, with, a, very, small, energy, but, in, 1, 38, of, cases, it, emits, an, alpha, particle, so, it, can, readily, be, identified, through, alpha, spectrometry, thirty, three, radioisotopes, have, been, identified, the, most, stable, being, 227, ac, with, a, half, life, of, 21, 772, years, 225, ac, with, a, half, life, of, 10, 0, days, and, 226, ac, with, a, half, life, of, 29, 37, hours, all, remaining, radioactive, isotopes, have, half, lives, that, are, less, than, 10, hours, and, the, majority, of, them, have, half, lives, shorter, than, one, minute, the, shortest, lived, known, isotope, of, actinium, is, 217, ac, half, life, of, 69, nanoseconds, which, decays, through, alpha, decay, actinium, also, has, two, known, meta, states, the, most, significant, isotopes, for, chemistry, are, 225, ac, 227, ac, and, 228, ac, purified, 227, ac, comes, into, equilibrium, with, its, decay, products, after, about, a, half, of, year, it, decays, according, to, its, 21, 772, year, half, life, emitting, mostly, beta, 98, 62, and, some, alpha, particles, 1, 38, the, successive, decay, products, are, part, of, the, actinium, series, owing, to, the, low, available, amounts, low, energy, of, its, beta, particles, maximum, 44, 8, kev, and, low, intensity, of, alpha, radiation, 227, ac, is, difficult, to, detect, directly, by, its, emission, and, it, is, therefore, traced, via, its, decay, products, the, isotopes, of, actinium, range, in, atomic, weight, from, 203, u, 203, ac, to, 236, u, 236, ac, actinium, is, found, only, in, traces, in, uranium, ores, one, tonne, of, uranium, in, ore, contains, about, 0, 2, milligrams, of, 227, ac, and, in, thorium, ores, which, contain, about, 5, nanograms, of, 228, ac, per, one, tonne, of, thorium, the, actinium, isotope, 227, ac, is, a, transient, member, of, the, uranium, actinium, series, decay, chain, which, begins, with, the, parent, isotope, 235, u, or, 239, pu, and, ends, with, the, stable, lead, isotope, 207, pb, the, isotope, 228, ac, is, a, transient, member, of, the, thorium, series, decay, chain, which, begins, with, the, parent, isotope, 232, th, and, ends, with, the, stable, lead, isotope, 208, pb, another, actinium, isotope, 225, ac, is, transiently, present, in, the, neptunium, series, decay, chain, beginning, with, 237, np, or, 233, u, and, ending, with, thallium, 205, tl, and, near, stable, bismuth, 209, bi, even, though, all, primordial, 237, np, has, decayed, away, it, is, continuously, produced, by, neutron, knock, out, reactions, on, natural, 238, u, the, low, natural, concentration, and, the, close, similarity, of, physical, and, chemical, properties, to, those, of, lanthanum, and, other, lanthanides, which, are, always, abundant, in, actinium, bearing, ores, render, separation, of, actinium, from, the, ore, impractical, the, most, concentrated, actinium, sample, prepared, from, raw, material, consisted, of, 7, micrograms, of, 227, ac, in, less, than, 0, 1, milligrams, of, la, 2, o, 3, and, complete, separation, was, never, achieved, instead, actinium, is, prepared, in, milligram, amounts, by, the, neutron, irradiation, of, 226, ra, in, a, nuclear, reactor, the, reaction, yield, is, about, 2, of, the, radium, weight, 227, ac, can, further, capture, neutrons, resulting, in, small, amounts, of, 228, ac, after, the, synthesis, actinium, is, separated, from, radium, and, from, the, products, of, decay, and, nuclear, fusion, such, as, thorium, polonium, lead, and, bismuth, the, extraction, can, be, performed, with, thenoyltrifluoroacetone, benzene, solution, from, an, aqueous, solution, of, the, radiation, products, and, the, selectivity, to, a, certain, element, is, achieved, by, adjusting, the, ph, to, about, 6, 0, for, actinium, an, alternative, procedure, is, anion, exchange, with, an, appropriate, resin, in, nitric, acid, which, can, result, in, a, separation, factor, of, 1, 000, 000, for, radium, and, actinium, vs, thorium, in, a, two, stage, process, actinium, can, then, be, separated, from, radium, with, a, ratio, of, about, 100, using, a, low, cross, linking, cation, exchange, resin, and, nitric, acid, as, eluant, 225, ac, was, first, produced, artificially, at, the, institute, for, transuranium, elements, itu, in, germany, using, a, cyclotron, and, at, st, george, hospital, in, sydney, using, a, linac, in, 2000, this, rare, isotope, has, potential, applications, in, radiation, therapy, and, is, most, efficiently, produced, by, bombarding, a, radium, 226, target, with, 20, 30, mev, deuterium, ions, this, reaction, also, yields, 226, ac, which, however, decays, with, a, half, life, of, 29, hours, and, thus, does, not, contaminate, 225, ac, actinium, metal, has, been, prepared, by, the, reduction, of, actinium, fluoride, with, lithium, vapor, in, vacuum, at, a, temperature, between, 1, 100, and, 1, 300, c, 2, 010, and, 2, 370, f, higher, temperatures, resulted, in, evaporation, of, the, product, and, lower, ones, lead, to, an, incomplete, transformation, lithium, was, chosen, among, other, alkali, metals, because, its, fluoride, is, most, volatile, owing, to, its, scarcity, high, price, and, radioactivity, 227, ac, currently, has, no, significant, industrial, use, but, 225, ac, is, currently, being, studied, for, use, in, cancer, treatments, such, as, targeted, alpha, therapies, 227, ac, is, highly, radioactive, and, was, therefore, studied, for, use, as, an, active, element, of, radioisotope, thermoelectric, generators, for, example, in, spacecraft, the, oxide, of, 227, ac, pressed, with, beryllium, is, also, an, efficient, neutron, source, with, the, activity, exceeding, that, of, the, standard, americium, beryllium, and, radium, beryllium, pairs, in, all, those, applications, 227, ac, a, beta, source, is, merely, a, progenitor, which, generates, alpha, emitting, isotopes, upon, its, decay, beryllium, captures, alpha, particles, and, emits, neutrons, owing, to, its, large, cross, section, for, the, n, nuclear, reaction, the, 227, acbe, neutron, sources, can, be, applied, in, a, neutron, probe, a, standard, device, for, measuring, the, quantity, of, water, present, in, soil, as, well, as, moisture, density, for, quality, control, in, highway, construction, such, probes, are, also, used, in, well, logging, applications, in, neutron, radiography, tomography, and, other, radiochemical, investigations, 225, ac, is, applied, in, medicine, to, produce, 213, bi, in, a, reusable, generator, or, can, be, used, alone, as, an, agent, for, radiation, therapy, in, particular, targeted, alpha, therapy, tat, this, isotope, has, a, half, life, of, 10, days, making, it, much, more, suitable, for, radiation, therapy, than, 213, bi, half, life, 46, minutes, additionally, 225, ac, decays, to, nontoxic, 209, bi, rather, than, toxic, lead, which, is, the, final, product, in, the, decay, chains, of, several, other, candidate, isotopes, namely, 227, th, 228, th, and, 230, u, not, only, 225, ac, itself, but, also, its, daughters, emit, alpha, particles, which, kill, cancer, cells, in, the, body, the, major, difficulty, with, application, of, 225, ac, was, that, intravenous, injection, of, simple, actinium, complexes, resulted, in, their, accumulation, in, the, bones, and, liver, for, a, period, of, tens, of, years, as, a, result, after, the, cancer, cells, were, quickly, killed, by, alpha, particles, from, 225, ac, the, radiation, from, the, actinium, and, its, daughters, might, induce, new, mutations, to, solve, this, problem, 225, ac, was, bound, to, a, chelating, agent, such, as, citrate, ethylenediaminetetraacetic, acid, edta, or, diethylene, triamine, pentaacetic, acid, dtpa, this, reduced, actinium, accumulation, in, the, bones, but, the, excretion, from, the, body, remained, slow, much, better, results, were, obtained, with, such, chelating, agents, as, heha, 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, hexaazacyclohexadecane, n, n, n, n, n, n, hexaacetic, acid, or, dota, 1, 4, 7, 10, tetraazacyclododecane, 1, 4, 7, 10, tetraacetic, acid, coupled, to, trastuzumab, a, monoclonal, antibody, that, interferes, with, the, her2, neu, receptor, the, latter, delivery, combination, was, tested, on, mice, and, proved, to, be, effective, against, leukemia, lymphoma, breast, ovarian, neuroblastoma, and, prostate, cancers, the, medium, half, life, of, 227, ac, 21, 77, years, makes, it, a, very, convenient, radioactive, isotope, in, modeling, the, slow, vertical, mixing, of, oceanic, waters, the, associated, processes, cannot, be, studied, with, the, required, accuracy, by, direct, measurements, of, current, velocities, of, the, order, 50, meters, per, year, however, evaluation, of, the, concentration, depth, profiles, for, different, isotopes, allows, estimating, the, mixing, rates, the, physics, behind, this, method, is, as, follows, oceanic, waters, contain, homogeneously, dispersed, 235, u, its, decay, product, 231, pa, gradually, precipitates, to, the, bottom, so, that, its, concentration, first, increases, with, depth, and, then, stays, nearly, constant, 231, pa, decays, to, 227, ac, however, the, concentration, of, the, latter, isotope, does, not, follow, the, 231, pa, depth, profile, but, instead, increases, toward, the, sea, bottom, this, occurs, because, of, the, mixing, processes, which, raise, some, additional, 227, ac, from, the, sea, bottom, thus, analysis, of, both, 231, pa, and, 227, ac, depth, profiles, allows, researchers, to, model, the, mixing, behavior, there, are, theoretical, predictions, that, ach, x, hydrides, in, this, case, with, very, high, pressure, are, a, candidate, for, a, near, room, temperature, superconductor, as, they, have, t, c, significantly, higher, than, h, 3, s, possibly, near, 250, k, 227, ac, is, highly, radioactive, and, experiments, with, it, are, carried, out, in, a, specially, designed, laboratory, equipped, with, a, tight, glove, box, when, actinium, trichloride, is, administered, intravenously, to, rats, about, 33, of, actinium, is, deposited, into, the, bones, and, 50, into, the, liver, its, toxicity, is, comparable, to, but, slightly, lower, than, that, of, americium, and, plutonium, for, trace, quantities, fume, hoods, with, good, aeration, suffice, for, gram, amounts, hot, cells, with, shielding, from, the, intense, gamma, radiation, emitted, by, 227, ac, are, necessary
