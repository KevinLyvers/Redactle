californium, is, a, synthetic, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, cf, and, atomic, number, 98, it, was, first, synthesized, in, 1950, at, lawrence, berkeley, national, laboratory, then, the, university, of, california, radiation, laboratory, by, bombarding, curium, with, alpha, particles, helium, 4, ions, it, is, an, actinide, element, the, sixth, transuranium, element, to, be, synthesized, and, has, the, second, highest, atomic, mass, of, all, elements, that, have, been, produced, in, amounts, large, enough, to, see, with, the, naked, eye, after, einsteinium, it, was, named, after, the, university, and, the, u, s, state, of, california, two, crystalline, forms, exist, at, normal, pressure, one, above, and, one, below, 900, c, 1, 650, f, a, third, form, exists, at, high, pressure, californium, slowly, tarnishes, in, air, at, room, temperature, californium, compounds, are, dominated, by, the, 3, oxidation, state, the, most, stable, of, californium, s, twenty, known, isotopes, is, californium, 251, with, a, half, life, of, 898, years, this, short, half, life, means, the, element, is, not, found, in, significant, quantities, in, the, earth, s, crust, 252, cf, with, a, half, life, of, about, 2, 645, years, is, the, most, common, isotope, used, and, is, produced, at, oak, ridge, national, laboratory, ornl, in, the, united, states, and, research, institute, of, atomic, reactors, in, russia, californium, is, one, of, the, few, transuranium, elements, with, practical, uses, most, of, these, applications, exploit, the, fact, that, certain, isotopes, of, californium, emit, neutrons, for, example, californium, can, be, used, to, help, start, up, nuclear, reactors, and, it, is, used, as, a, source, of, neutrons, when, studying, materials, using, neutron, diffraction, and, neutron, spectroscopy, it, can, also, be, used, in, nuclear, synthesis, of, higher, mass, elements, oganesson, element, 118, was, synthesized, by, bombarding, californium, 249, atoms, with, calcium, 48, ions, users, of, californium, must, take, into, account, radiological, concerns, and, the, element, s, ability, to, disrupt, the, formation, of, red, blood, cells, by, bioaccumulating, in, skeletal, tissue, californium, is, a, silvery, white, actinide, metal, with, a, melting, point, of, 900, 30, c, 1, 650, 50, f, and, an, estimated, boiling, point, of, 1, 743, k, 1, 470, c, 2, 680, f, the, pure, metal, is, malleable, and, is, easily, cut, with, a, knife, californium, metal, starts, to, vaporize, above, 300, c, 570, f, when, exposed, to, a, vacuum, below, 51, k, 222, c, 368, f, californium, metal, is, either, ferromagnetic, or, ferrimagnetic, it, acts, like, a, magnet, between, 48, and, 66, k, it, is, antiferromagnetic, an, intermediate, state, and, above, 160, k, 113, c, 172, f, it, is, paramagnetic, external, magnetic, fields, can, make, it, magnetic, it, forms, alloys, with, lanthanide, metals, but, little, is, known, about, the, resulting, materials, the, element, has, two, crystalline, forms, at, standard, atmospheric, pressure, a, double, hexagonal, close, packed, form, dubbed, alpha, and, a, face, centered, cubic, form, designated, beta, the, form, exists, below, 600, 800, c, with, a, density, of, 15, 10, g, cm, 3, and, the, form, exists, above, 600, 800, c, with, a, density, of, 8, 74, g, cm, 3, at, 48, gpa, of, pressure, the, form, changes, into, an, orthorhombic, crystal, system, due, to, delocalization, of, the, atom, s, 5f, electrons, which, frees, them, to, bond, the, bulk, modulus, of, a, material, is, a, measure, of, its, resistance, to, uniform, pressure, californium, s, bulk, modulus, is, 50, 5, gpa, which, is, similar, to, trivalent, lanthanide, metals, but, smaller, than, more, familiar, metals, such, as, aluminium, 70, gpa, californium, exhibits, oxidation, states, of, 4, 3, or, 2, it, typically, forms, eight, or, nine, bonds, to, surrounding, atoms, or, ions, its, chemical, properties, are, predicted, to, be, similar, to, other, primarily, 3, valence, actinide, elements, and, the, element, dysprosium, which, is, the, lanthanide, above, californium, in, the, periodic, table, compounds, in, the, 4, oxidation, state, are, strong, oxidizing, agents, and, those, in, the, 2, state, are, strong, reducing, agents, the, element, slowly, tarnishes, in, air, at, room, temperature, with, the, rate, increasing, when, moisture, is, added, californium, reacts, when, heated, with, hydrogen, nitrogen, or, a, chalcogen, oxygen, family, element, reactions, with, dry, hydrogen, and, aqueous, mineral, acids, are, rapid, californium, is, only, water, soluble, as, the, californium, iii, cation, attempts, to, reduce, or, oxidize, the, 3, ion, in, solution, have, failed, the, element, forms, a, water, soluble, chloride, nitrate, perchlorate, and, sulfate, and, is, precipitated, as, a, fluoride, oxalate, or, hydroxide, californium, is, the, heaviest, actinide, to, exhibit, covalent, properties, as, is, observed, in, the, californium, borate, twenty, isotopes, of, californium, are, known, mass, number, ranging, from, 237, to, 256, the, most, stable, are, 251, cf, with, half, life, 898, years, 249, cf, with, half, life, 351, years, 250, cf, at, 13, 08, years, and, 252, cf, at, 2, 645, years, all, other, isotopes, have, half, life, shorter, than, a, year, and, most, of, these, have, half, lives, less, than, 20, minutes, 249, cf, is, formed, by, beta, decay, of, berkelium, 249, and, most, other, californium, isotopes, are, made, by, subjecting, berkelium, to, intense, neutron, radiation, in, a, nuclear, reactor, though, californium, 251, has, the, longest, half, life, its, production, yield, is, only, 10, due, to, its, tendency, to, collect, neutrons, high, neutron, capture, and, its, tendency, to, interact, with, other, particles, high, neutron, cross, section, 252, cf, is, a, very, strong, neutron, emitter, which, makes, it, extremely, radioactive, and, harmful, 252, cf, 96, 9, of, the, time, alpha, decays, to, curium, 248, the, other, 3, 1, of, decays, are, spontaneous, fission, one, microgram, g, of, 252, cf, emits, 2, 3, million, neutrons, per, second, an, average, of, 3, 7, neutrons, per, spontaneous, fission, most, other, isotopes, of, californium, alpha, decay, to, curium, atomic, number, 96, californium, was, first, made, at, university, of, california, radiation, laboratory, berkeley, by, physics, researchers, stanley, gerald, thompson, kenneth, street, jr, albert, ghiorso, and, glenn, t, seaborg, about, february, 9, 1950, it, was, the, sixth, transuranium, element, to, be, discovered, the, team, announced, its, discovery, on, march, 17, 1950, to, produce, californium, a, microgram, size, target, of, curium, 242, 242, 96, cm, was, bombarded, with, 35, mev, alpha, particles, 4, 2, he, in, the, 60, inch, diameter, 1, 52, m, cyclotron, at, berkeley, which, produced, californium, 245, 245, 98, cf, plus, one, free, neutron, n, to, identify, and, separate, out, the, element, ion, exchange, and, adsorsion, methods, were, undertaken, only, about, 5, 000, atoms, of, californium, were, produced, in, this, experiment, and, these, atoms, had, a, half, life, of, 44, minutes, the, discoverers, named, the, new, element, after, the, university, and, the, state, this, was, a, break, from, the, convention, used, for, elements, 95, to, 97, which, drew, inspiration, from, how, the, elements, directly, above, them, in, the, periodic, table, were, named, however, the, element, directly, above, element, 98, in, the, periodic, table, dysprosium, has, a, name, that, means, hard, to, get, at, so, the, researchers, decided, to, set, aside, the, informal, naming, convention, they, added, that, the, best, we, can, do, is, to, point, out, searchers, a, century, ago, found, it, difficult, to, get, to, california, weighable, amounts, of, californium, were, first, produced, by, the, irradiation, of, plutonium, targets, at, materials, testing, reactor, at, national, reactor, testing, station, eastern, idaho, these, findings, were, reported, in, 1954, the, high, spontaneous, fission, rate, of, californium, 252, was, observed, in, these, samples, the, first, experiment, with, californium, in, concentrated, form, occurred, in, 1958, the, isotopes, 249, cf, to, 252, cf, were, isolated, that, same, year, from, a, sample, of, plutonium, 239, that, had, been, irradiated, with, neutrons, in, a, nuclear, reactor, for, five, years, two, years, later, in, 1960, burris, cunningham, and, james, wallman, of, lawrence, radiation, laboratory, of, the, university, of, california, created, the, first, californium, compounds, californium, trichloride, californium, iii, oxychloride, and, californium, oxide, by, treating, californium, with, steam, and, hydrochloric, acid, the, high, flux, isotope, reactor, hfir, at, ornl, in, oak, ridge, tennessee, started, producing, small, batches, of, californium, in, the, 1960s, by, 1995, hfir, nominally, produced, 500, milligrams, 0, 018, oz, of, californium, annually, plutonium, supplied, by, the, united, kingdom, to, the, united, states, under, the, 1958, us, uk, mutual, defence, agreement, was, used, for, making, californium, the, atomic, energy, commission, sold, 252, cf, to, industrial, and, academic, customers, in, the, early, 1970s, for, 10, microgram, and, an, average, of, 150, mg, 0, 0053, oz, of, 252, cf, were, shipped, each, year, from, 1970, to, 1990, californium, metal, was, first, prepared, in, 1974, by, haire, and, baybarz, who, reduced, californium, iii, oxide, with, lanthanum, metal, to, obtain, microgram, amounts, of, sub, micrometer, thick, films, traces, of, californium, can, be, found, near, facilities, that, use, the, element, in, mineral, prospecting, and, in, medical, treatments, the, element, is, fairly, insoluble, in, water, but, it, adheres, well, to, ordinary, soil, and, concentrations, of, it, in, the, soil, can, be, 500, times, higher, than, in, the, water, surrounding, the, soil, particles, nuclear, fallout, from, atmospheric, nuclear, weapons, testing, prior, to, 1980, contributed, a, small, amount, of, californium, to, the, environment, californium, 249, 252, 253, and, 254, have, been, observed, in, the, radioactive, dust, collected, from, the, air, after, a, nuclear, explosion, californium, is, not, a, major, radionuclide, at, united, states, department, of, energy, legacy, sites, since, it, was, not, produced, in, large, quantities, californium, was, once, believed, to, be, produced, in, supernovas, as, their, decay, matches, the, 60, day, half, life, of, 254, cf, however, subsequent, studies, failed, to, demonstrate, any, californium, spectra, and, supernova, light, curves, are, now, thought, to, follow, the, decay, of, nickel, 56, the, transuranic, elements, americium, to, fermium, including, californium, occurred, naturally, in, the, natural, nuclear, fission, reactor, at, oklo, but, no, longer, do, so, spectral, lines, of, californium, along, with, those, of, several, other, non, primordial, elements, were, detected, in, przybylski, s, star, in, 2008, californium, is, produced, in, nuclear, reactors, and, particle, accelerators, californium, 250, is, made, by, bombarding, berkelium, 249, 249, bk, with, neutrons, forming, berkelium, 250, 250, bk, via, neutron, capture, n, which, in, turn, quickly, beta, decays, to, californium, 250, 250, cf, in, the, following, reaction, bombardment, of, 250, cf, with, neutrons, produces, 251, cf, and, 252, cf, prolonged, irradiation, of, americium, curium, and, plutonium, with, neutrons, produces, milligram, amounts, of, 252, cf, and, microgram, amounts, of, 249, cf, as, of, 2006, curium, isotopes, 244, to, 248, are, irradiated, by, neutrons, in, special, reactors, to, produce, mainly, californium, 252, with, lesser, amounts, of, isotopes, 249, to, 255, microgram, quantities, of, 252, cf, are, available, for, commercial, use, through, the, u, s, nuclear, regulatory, commission, only, two, sites, produce, 252, cf, oak, ridge, national, laboratory, in, the, u, s, and, the, research, institute, of, atomic, reactors, in, dimitrovgrad, russia, as, of, 2003, the, two, sites, produce, 0, 25, grams, and, 0, 025, grams, of, 252, cf, per, year, respectively, three, californium, isotopes, with, significant, half, lives, are, produced, requiring, a, total, of, 15, neutron, captures, by, uranium, 238, without, nuclear, fission, or, alpha, decay, occurring, during, the, process, 253, cf, is, at, the, end, of, a, production, chain, that, starts, with, uranium, 238, and, includes, several, isotopes, of, plutonium, americium, curium, and, berkelium, and, the, californium, isotopes, 249, to, 253, see, diagram, californium, 252, has, a, number, of, specialized, uses, as, a, strong, neutron, emitter, it, produces, 139, million, neutrons, per, microgram, per, minute, this, property, makes, it, useful, as, a, startup, neutron, source, for, some, nuclear, reactors, and, as, a, portable, non, reactor, based, neutron, source, for, neutron, activation, analysis, to, detect, trace, amounts, of, elements, in, samples, neutrons, from, californium, are, used, as, a, treatment, of, certain, cervical, and, brain, cancers, where, other, radiation, therapy, is, ineffective, it, has, been, used, in, educational, applications, since, 1969, when, georgia, institute, of, technology, got, a, loan, of, 119, g, of, 252, cf, from, the, savannah, river, site, it, is, also, used, with, online, elemental, coal, analyzers, and, bulk, material, analyzers, in, the, coal, and, cement, industries, neutron, penetration, into, materials, makes, californium, useful, in, detection, instruments, such, as, fuel, rod, scanners, neutron, radiography, of, aircraft, and, weapons, components, to, detect, corrosion, bad, welds, cracks, and, trapped, moisture, and, in, portable, metal, detectors, neutron, moisture, gauges, use, 252, cf, to, find, water, and, petroleum, layers, in, oil, wells, as, a, portable, neutron, source, for, gold, and, silver, prospecting, for, on, the, spot, analysis, and, to, detect, ground, water, movement, the, main, uses, of, 252, cf, in, 1982, were, reactor, start, up, 48, 3, fuel, rod, scanning, 25, 3, and, activation, analysis, 19, 4, by, 1994, most, 252, cf, was, used, in, neutron, radiography, 77, 4, with, fuel, rod, scanning, 12, 1, and, reactor, start, up, 6, 9, as, important, but, secondary, uses, in, 2021, fast, neutrons, from, 252, cf, were, used, for, wireless, data, transmission, 251, cf, has, a, very, small, calculated, critical, mass, of, about, 5, kg, 11, lb, high, lethality, and, a, relatively, short, period, of, toxic, environmental, irradiation, the, low, critical, mass, of, californium, led, to, some, exaggerated, claims, about, possible, uses, for, the, element, in, october, 2006, researchers, announced, that, three, atoms, of, oganesson, element, 118, had, been, identified, at, joint, institute, for, nuclear, research, in, dubna, russia, from, bombarding, 249, cf, with, calcium, 48, making, it, the, heaviest, element, ever, made, the, target, contained, about, 10, mg, of, 249, cf, deposited, on, a, titanium, foil, of, 32, cm, 2, area, californium, has, also, been, used, to, produce, other, transuranic, elements, for, example, lawrencium, was, first, synthesized, in, 1961, by, bombarding, californium, with, boron, nuclei, californium, that, bioaccumulates, in, skeletal, tissue, releases, radiation, that, disrupts, the, body, s, ability, to, form, red, blood, cells, the, element, plays, no, natural, biological, role, in, any, organism, due, to, its, intense, radioactivity, and, low, concentration, in, the, environment, californium, can, enter, the, body, from, ingesting, contaminated, food, or, drinks, or, by, breathing, air, with, suspended, particles, of, the, element, once, in, the, body, only, 0, 05, of, the, californium, will, reach, the, bloodstream, about, 65, of, that, californium, will, be, deposited, in, the, skeleton, 25, in, the, liver, and, the, rest, in, other, organs, or, excreted, mainly, in, urine, half, of, the, californium, deposited, in, the, skeleton, and, liver, are, gone, in, 50, and, 20, years, respectively, californium, in, the, skeleton, adheres, to, bone, surfaces, before, slowly, migrating, throughout, the, bone, the, element, is, most, dangerous, if, taken, into, the, body, in, addition, californium, 249, and, californium, 251, can, cause, tissue, damage, externally, through, gamma, ray, emission, ionizing, radiation, emitted, by, californium, on, bone, and, in, the, liver, can, cause, cancer, media, related, to, californium, at, wikimedia, commons
