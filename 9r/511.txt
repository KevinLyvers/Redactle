in, organic, chemistry, a, ketone, k, i, t, o, n, is, an, organic, compound, with, the, structure, r, c, o, r, where, r, and, r, can, be, a, variety, of, carbon, containing, substituents, ketones, contain, a, carbonyl, group, c, o, a, carbon, oxygen, double, bond, c, o, the, simplest, ketone, is, acetone, where, r, and, r, is, methyl, with, the, formula, ch, 3, 2, co, many, ketones, are, of, great, importance, in, biology, and, industry, examples, include, many, sugars, ketoses, many, steroids, e, g, testosterone, and, the, solvent, acetone, the, word, ketone, is, derived, from, aketon, an, old, german, word, for, acetone, according, to, the, rules, of, iupac, nomenclature, ketone, names, are, derived, by, changing, the, suffix, ane, of, the, parent, alkane, to, anone, typically, the, position, of, the, carbonyl, group, is, denoted, by, a, number, but, traditional, nonsystematic, names, are, still, generally, used, for, the, most, important, ketones, for, example, acetone, and, benzophenone, these, nonsystematic, names, are, considered, retained, iupac, names, although, some, introductory, chemistry, textbooks, use, systematic, names, such, as, 2, propanone, or, propan, 2, one, for, the, simplest, ketone, c, h, 3, c, o, ch, 3, instead, of, acetone, the, derived, names, of, ketones, are, obtained, by, writing, separately, the, names, of, the, two, alkyl, groups, attached, to, the, carbonyl, group, followed, by, ketone, as, a, separate, word, traditionally, the, names, of, the, alkyl, groups, were, written, in, order, of, increasing, complexity, for, example, methyl, ethyl, ketone, however, according, to, the, rules, of, iupac, nomenclature, the, alkyl, groups, are, written, alphabetically, for, example, ethyl, methyl, ketone, when, the, two, alkyl, groups, are, the, same, the, prefix, di, is, added, before, the, name, of, alkyl, group, the, positions, of, other, groups, are, indicated, by, greek, letters, the, carbon, being, the, atom, adjacent, to, carbonyl, group, although, used, infrequently, oxo, is, the, iupac, nomenclature, for, the, oxo, group, o, and, used, as, prefix, when, the, ketone, does, not, have, the, highest, priority, other, prefixes, however, are, also, used, for, some, common, chemicals, mainly, in, biochemistry, keto, refer, to, the, ketone, functional, group, the, ketone, carbon, is, often, described, as, sp, 2, hybridized, a, description, that, includes, both, their, electronic, and, molecular, structure, ketones, are, trigonal, planar, around, the, ketonic, carbon, with, c, c, o, and, c, c, c, bond, angles, of, approximately, 120, ketones, differ, from, aldehydes, in, that, the, carbonyl, group, c, o, is, bonded, to, two, carbons, within, a, carbon, skeleton, in, aldehydes, the, carbonyl, is, bonded, to, one, carbon, and, one, hydrogen, and, are, located, at, the, ends, of, carbon, chains, ketones, are, also, distinct, from, other, carbonyl, containing, functional, groups, such, as, carboxylic, acids, esters, and, amides, the, carbonyl, group, is, polar, because, the, electronegativity, of, the, oxygen, is, greater, than, that, for, carbon, thus, ketones, are, nucleophilic, at, oxygen, and, electrophilic, at, carbon, because, the, carbonyl, group, interacts, with, water, by, hydrogen, bonding, ketones, are, typically, more, soluble, in, water, than, the, related, methylene, compounds, ketones, are, hydrogen, bond, acceptors, ketones, are, not, usually, hydrogen, bond, donors, and, cannot, hydrogen, bond, to, themselves, because, of, their, inability, to, serve, both, as, hydrogen, bond, donors, and, acceptors, ketones, tend, not, to, self, associate, and, are, more, volatile, than, alcohols, and, carboxylic, acids, of, comparable, molecular, weights, these, factors, relate, to, the, pervasiveness, of, ketones, in, perfumery, and, as, solvents, ketones, are, classified, on, the, basis, of, their, substituents, one, broad, classification, subdivides, ketones, into, symmetrical, and, unsymmetrical, derivatives, depending, on, the, equivalency, of, the, two, organic, substituents, attached, to, the, carbonyl, center, acetone, and, benzophenone, c, 6, h, 5, 2, co, are, symmetrical, ketones, acetophenone, c, 6, h, 5, c, o, ch, 3, is, an, unsymmetrical, ketone, many, kinds, of, diketones, are, known, some, with, unusual, properties, the, simplest, is, diacetyl, ch, 3, c, o, c, o, ch, 3, once, used, as, butter, flavoring, in, popcorn, acetylacetone, pentane, 2, 4, dione, is, virtually, a, misnomer, inappropriate, name, because, this, species, exists, mainly, as, the, monoenol, ch, 3, c, o, ch, c, oh, ch, 3, its, enolate, is, a, common, ligand, in, coordination, chemistry, ketones, containing, alkene, and, alkyne, units, are, often, called, unsaturated, ketones, a, widely, used, member, of, this, class, of, compounds, is, methyl, vinyl, ketone, ch, 3, c, o, ch, ch, 2, a, unsaturated, carbonyl, compound, many, ketones, are, cyclic, the, simplest, class, have, the, formula, ch, 2, n, co, where, n, varies, from, 2, for, cyclopropanone, ch, 2, 2, co, to, the, tens, larger, derivatives, exist, cyclohexanone, ch, 2, 5, co, a, symmetrical, cyclic, ketone, is, an, important, intermediate, in, the, production, of, nylon, isophorone, derived, from, acetone, is, an, unsaturated, asymmetrical, ketone, that, is, the, precursor, to, other, polymers, muscone, 3, methylpentadecanone, is, an, animal, pheromone, another, cyclic, ketone, is, cyclobutanone, having, the, formula, ch, 2, 3, co, an, aldehyde, differs, from, a, ketone, in, that, it, has, a, hydrogen, atom, attached, to, its, carbonyl, group, making, aldehydes, easier, to, oxidize, ketones, do, not, have, a, hydrogen, atom, bonded, to, the, carbonyl, group, and, are, therefore, more, resistant, to, oxidation, they, are, oxidized, only, by, powerful, oxidizing, agents, which, have, the, ability, to, cleave, carbon, carbon, bonds, ketones, and, aldehydes, absorb, strongly, in, the, infra, red, spectrum, near, 1750, cm, 1, which, is, assigned, to, c, o, carbonyl, stretching, frequency, the, energy, of, the, peak, is, lower, for, aryl, and, unsaturated, ketones, whereas, 1, h, nmr, spectroscopy, is, generally, not, useful, for, establishing, the, presence, of, a, ketone, 13, c, nmr, spectra, exhibit, signals, somewhat, downfield, of, 200, ppm, depending, on, structure, such, signals, are, typically, weak, due, to, the, absence, of, nuclear, overhauser, effects, since, aldehydes, resonate, at, similar, chemical, shifts, multiple, resonance, experiments, are, employed, to, definitively, distinguish, aldehydes, and, ketones, ketones, give, positive, results, in, brady, s, test, the, reaction, with, 2, 4, dinitrophenylhydrazine, to, give, the, corresponding, hydrazone, ketones, may, be, distinguished, from, aldehydes, by, giving, a, negative, result, with, tollens, reagent, or, with, fehling, s, solution, methyl, ketones, give, positive, results, for, the, iodoform, test, ketones, also, give, positive, results, when, treated, with, m, dinitrobenzene, in, presence, of, dilute, sodium, hydroxide, to, give, violet, coloration, many, methods, exist, for, the, preparation, of, ketones, in, industrial, scale, and, academic, laboratories, ketones, are, also, produced, in, various, ways, by, organisms, see, the, section, on, biochemistry, below, in, industry, the, most, important, method, probably, involves, oxidation, of, hydrocarbons, often, with, air, for, example, a, billion, kilograms, of, cyclohexanone, are, produced, annually, by, aerobic, oxidation, of, cyclohexane, acetone, is, prepared, by, air, oxidation, of, cumene, for, specialized, or, small, scale, organic, synthetic, applications, ketones, are, often, prepared, by, oxidation, of, secondary, alcohols, typical, strong, oxidants, source, of, o, in, the, above, reaction, include, potassium, permanganate, or, a, cr, vi, compound, milder, conditions, make, use, of, the, dess, martin, periodinane, or, the, moffatt, swern, methods, many, other, methods, have, been, developed, examples, include, ketones, that, have, at, least, one, alpha, hydrogen, undergo, keto, enol, tautomerization, the, tautomer, is, an, enol, tautomerization, is, catalyzed, by, both, acids, and, bases, usually, the, keto, form, is, more, stable, than, the, enol, this, equilibrium, allows, ketones, to, be, prepared, via, the, hydration, of, alkynes, c, h, bonds, adjacent, to, the, carbonyl, in, ketones, are, more, acidic, p, k, a, 20, than, the, c, h, bonds, in, alkane, p, k, a, 50, this, difference, reflects, resonance, stabilization, of, the, enolate, ion, that, is, formed, upon, deprotonation, the, relative, acidity, of, the, hydrogen, is, important, in, the, enolization, reactions, of, ketones, and, other, carbonyl, compounds, the, acidity, of, the, hydrogen, also, allows, ketones, and, other, carbonyl, compounds, to, react, as, nucleophiles, at, that, position, with, either, stoichiometric, and, catalytic, base, using, very, strong, bases, like, lithium, diisopropylamide, lda, p, k, a, of, conjugate, acid, 36, under, non, equilibrating, conditions, 78, c, 1, 1, equiv, lda, in, thf, ketone, added, to, base, the, less, substituted, kinetic, enolate, is, generated, selectively, while, conditions, that, allow, for, equilibration, higher, temperature, base, added, to, ketone, using, weak, or, insoluble, bases, e, g, ch, 3, ch, 2, ona, in, ch, 3, ch, 2, oh, or, nah, provides, the, more, substituted, thermodynamic, enolate, ketones, are, also, weak, bases, undergoing, protonation, on, the, carbonyl, oxygen, in, the, presence, of, br, nsted, acids, ketonium, ions, i, e, protonated, ketones, are, strong, acids, with, p, k, a, values, estimated, to, be, somewhere, between, 5, and, 7, although, acids, encountered, in, organic, chemistry, are, seldom, strong, enough, to, fully, protonate, ketones, the, formation, of, equilibrium, concentrations, of, protonated, ketones, is, nevertheless, an, important, step, in, the, mechanisms, of, many, common, organic, reactions, like, the, formation, of, an, acetal, for, example, acids, as, weak, as, pyridinium, cation, as, found, in, pyridinium, tosylate, with, a, p, k, a, of, 5, 2, are, able, to, serve, as, catalysts, in, this, context, despite, the, highly, unfavorable, equilibrium, constant, for, protonation, k, eq, 10, 10, an, important, set, of, reactions, follow, from, the, susceptibility, of, the, carbonyl, carbon, toward, nucleophilic, addition, and, the, tendency, for, the, enolates, to, add, to, electrophiles, nucleophilic, additions, include, in, approximate, order, of, their, generality, ketones, are, cleaved, by, strong, oxidizing, agents, and, at, elevated, temperatures, their, oxidation, involves, carbon, carbon, bond, cleavage, to, afford, a, mixture, of, carboxylic, acids, having, lesser, number, of, carbon, atoms, than, the, parent, ketone, ketones, do, not, appear, in, standard, amino, acids, nucleic, acids, nor, lipids, the, formation, of, organic, compounds, in, photosynthesis, occurs, via, the, ketone, ribulose, 1, 5, bisphosphate, many, sugars, are, ketones, known, collectively, as, ketoses, the, best, known, ketose, is, fructose, it, mostly, exists, as, a, cyclic, hemiketal, which, masks, the, ketone, functional, group, fatty, acid, synthesis, proceeds, via, ketones, acetoacetate, is, an, intermediate, in, the, krebs, cycle, which, releases, energy, from, sugars, and, carbohydrates, in, medicine, acetone, acetoacetate, and, beta, hydroxybutyrate, are, collectively, called, ketone, bodies, generated, from, carbohydrates, fatty, acids, and, amino, acids, in, most, vertebrates, including, humans, ketone, bodies, are, elevated, in, the, blood, ketosis, after, fasting, including, a, night, of, sleep, in, both, blood, and, urine, in, starvation, in, hypoglycemia, due, to, causes, other, than, hyperinsulinism, in, various, inborn, errors, of, metabolism, and, intentionally, induced, via, a, ketogenic, diet, and, in, ketoacidosis, usually, due, to, diabetes, mellitus, although, ketoacidosis, is, characteristic, of, decompensated, or, untreated, type, 1, diabetes, ketosis, or, even, ketoacidosis, can, occur, in, type, 2, diabetes, in, some, circumstances, as, well, ketones, are, produced, on, massive, scales, in, industry, as, solvents, polymer, precursors, and, pharmaceuticals, in, terms, of, scale, the, most, important, ketones, are, acetone, methylethyl, ketone, and, cyclohexanone, they, are, also, common, in, biochemistry, but, less, so, than, in, organic, chemistry, in, general, the, combustion, of, hydrocarbons, is, an, uncontrolled, oxidation, process, that, gives, ketones, as, well, as, many, other, types, of, compounds, although, it, is, difficult, to, generalize, on, the, toxicity, of, such, a, broad, class, of, compounds, simple, ketones, are, in, general, not, highly, toxic, this, characteristic, is, one, reason, for, their, popularity, as, solvents, exceptions, to, this, rule, are, the, unsaturated, ketones, such, as, methyl, vinyl, ketone, with, ld, 50, of, 7, mg, kg, oral
