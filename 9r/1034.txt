the, large, hadron, collider, lhc, is, the, world, s, largest, and, highest, energy, particle, collider, it, was, built, by, the, european, organization, for, nuclear, research, cern, between, 1998, and, 2008, in, collaboration, with, over, 10, 000, scientists, and, hundreds, of, universities, and, laboratories, across, more, than, 100, countries, it, lies, in, a, tunnel, 27, kilometres, 17, mi, in, circumference, and, as, deep, as, 175, metres, 574, ft, beneath, the, france, switzerland, border, near, geneva, the, first, collisions, were, achieved, in, 2010, at, an, energy, of, 3, 5, tera, electronvolts, tev, per, beam, about, four, times, the, previous, world, record, the, discovery, of, the, higgs, boson, at, the, lhc, was, announced, in, 2012, between, 2013, and, 2015, the, lhc, was, shut, down, and, upgraded, after, those, upgrades, it, reached, 6, 5, tev, per, beam, 13, 0, tev, total, collision, energy, at, the, end, of, 2018, it, was, shut, down, for, maintenance, and, further, upgrades, reopening, over, three, years, later, in, april, 2022, the, collider, has, four, crossing, points, where, the, accelerated, particles, collide, nine, detectors, each, designed, to, detect, different, phenomena, are, positioned, around, the, crossing, points, the, lhc, primarily, collides, proton, beams, but, it, can, also, accelerate, beams, of, heavy, ions, such, as, in, lead, lead, collisions, and, proton, lead, collisions, the, lhc, s, goal, is, to, allow, physicists, to, test, the, predictions, of, different, theories, of, particle, physics, including, measuring, the, properties, of, the, higgs, boson, searching, for, the, large, family, of, new, particles, predicted, by, supersymmetric, theories, and, studying, other, unresolved, questions, in, particle, physics, the, term, hadron, refers, to, subatomic, composite, particles, composed, of, quarks, held, together, by, the, strong, force, analogous, to, the, way, that, atoms, and, molecules, are, held, together, by, the, electromagnetic, force, the, best, known, hadrons, are, the, baryons, such, as, protons, and, neutrons, hadrons, also, include, mesons, such, as, the, pion, and, kaon, which, were, discovered, during, cosmic, ray, experiments, in, the, late, 1940s, and, early, 1950s, a, collider, is, a, type, of, a, particle, accelerator, that, brings, two, opposing, particle, beams, together, such, that, the, particles, collide, in, particle, physics, colliders, though, harder, to, construct, are, a, powerful, research, tool, because, they, reach, a, much, higher, center, of, mass, energy, than, fixed, target, setups, analysis, of, the, byproducts, of, these, collisions, gives, scientists, good, evidence, of, the, structure, of, the, subatomic, world, and, the, laws, of, nature, governing, it, many, of, these, byproducts, are, produced, only, by, high, energy, collisions, and, they, decay, after, very, short, periods, of, time, thus, many, of, them, are, hard, or, nearly, impossible, to, study, in, other, ways, many, physicists, hope, that, the, large, hadron, collider, will, help, answer, some, of, the, fundamental, open, questions, in, physics, which, concern, the, basic, laws, governing, the, interactions, and, forces, among, elementary, particles, and, the, deep, structure, of, space, and, time, particularly, the, interrelation, between, quantum, mechanics, and, general, relativity, these, high, energy, particle, experiments, can, provide, data, to, support, different, scientific, models, for, example, the, standard, model, and, higgsless, model, required, high, energy, particle, experiment, data, to, validate, their, predictions, and, allow, further, theoretical, development, the, standard, model, was, completed, by, detection, of, the, higgs, boson, by, the, lhc, in, 2012, lhc, collisions, have, explored, other, questions, including, other, open, questions, that, may, be, explored, using, high, energy, particle, collisions, include, the, collider, is, contained, in, a, circular, tunnel, with, a, circumference, of, 26, 7, kilometres, 16, 6, mi, at, a, depth, ranging, from, 50, to, 175, metres, 164, to, 574, ft, underground, the, variation, in, depth, was, deliberate, to, reduce, the, amount, of, tunnel, that, lies, under, the, jura, mountains, to, avoid, having, to, excavate, a, vertical, access, shaft, there, a, tunnel, was, chosen, to, avoid, having, to, purchase, expensive, land, on, the, surface, and, to, take, advantage, of, the, shielding, against, background, radiation, that, the, earth, s, crust, provides, the, 3, 8, metre, 12, ft, wide, concrete, lined, tunnel, constructed, between, 1983, and, 1988, was, formerly, used, to, house, the, large, electron, positron, collider, the, tunnel, crosses, the, border, between, switzerland, and, france, at, four, points, with, most, of, it, in, france, surface, buildings, hold, ancillary, equipment, such, as, compressors, ventilation, equipment, control, electronics, and, refrigeration, plants, the, collider, tunnel, contains, two, adjacent, parallel, beamlines, or, beam, pipes, each, containing, a, beam, which, travel, in, opposite, directions, around, the, ring, the, beams, intersect, at, four, points, around, the, ring, which, is, where, the, particle, collisions, take, place, some, 1, 232, dipole, magnets, keep, the, beams, on, their, circular, path, see, image, while, an, additional, 392, quadrupole, magnets, are, used, to, keep, the, beams, focused, with, stronger, quadrupole, magnets, close, to, the, intersection, points, in, order, to, maximize, the, chances, of, interaction, where, the, two, beams, cross, magnets, of, higher, multipole, orders, are, used, to, correct, smaller, imperfections, in, the, field, geometry, in, total, about, 10, 000, superconducting, magnets, are, installed, with, the, dipole, magnets, having, a, mass, of, over, 27, tonnes, about, 96, tonnes, of, superfluid, helium, 4, is, needed, to, keep, the, magnets, made, of, copper, clad, niobium, titanium, at, their, operating, temperature, of, 1, 9, k, 271, 25, c, making, the, lhc, the, largest, cryogenic, facility, in, the, world, at, liquid, helium, temperature, lhc, uses, 470, tonnes, of, nb, ti, superconductor, during, lhc, operations, the, cern, site, draws, roughly, 200, mw, of, electrical, power, from, the, french, electrical, grid, which, for, comparison, is, about, one, third, the, energy, consumption, of, the, city, of, geneva, the, lhc, accelerator, and, detectors, draw, about, 120, mw, thereof, each, day, of, its, operation, generates, 140, terabytes, of, data, when, running, an, energy, of, 6, 5, tev, per, proton, once, or, twice, a, day, as, the, protons, are, accelerated, from, 450, gev, to, 6, 5, tev, the, field, of, the, superconducting, dipole, magnets, is, increased, from, 0, 54, to, 7, 7, teslas, t, the, protons, each, have, an, energy, of, 6, 5, tev, giving, a, total, collision, energy, of, 13, tev, at, this, energy, the, protons, have, a, lorentz, factor, of, about, 6, 930, and, move, at, about, 0, 999, 999, 990, c, or, about, 3, 1, m, s, 11, km, h, slower, than, the, speed, of, light, c, it, takes, less, than, 90, microseconds, s, for, a, proton, to, travel, 26, 7, km, around, the, main, ring, this, results, in, 11, 245, revolutions, per, second, for, protons, whether, the, particles, are, at, low, or, high, energy, in, the, main, ring, since, the, speed, difference, between, these, energies, is, beyond, the, fifth, decimal, rather, than, having, continuous, beams, the, protons, are, bunched, together, into, up, to, 2, 808, bunches, with, 115, billion, protons, in, each, bunch, so, that, interactions, between, the, two, beams, take, place, at, discrete, intervals, mainly, 25, nanoseconds, ns, apart, providing, a, bunch, collision, rate, of, 40, mhz, it, was, operated, with, fewer, bunches, in, the, first, years, the, design, luminosity, of, the, lhc, is, 10, 34, cm, 2, s, 1, which, was, first, reached, in, june, 2016, by, 2017, twice, this, value, was, achieved, before, being, injected, into, the, main, accelerator, the, particles, are, prepared, by, a, series, of, systems, that, successively, increase, their, energy, the, first, system, is, the, linear, particle, accelerator, linac4, generating, 160, mev, negative, hydrogen, ions, h, ions, which, feeds, the, proton, synchrotron, booster, psb, there, both, electrons, are, stripped, from, the, hydrogen, ions, leaving, only, the, nucleus, containing, one, proton, protons, are, then, accelerated, to, 2, gev, and, injected, into, the, proton, synchrotron, ps, where, they, are, accelerated, to, 26, gev, finally, the, super, proton, synchrotron, sps, is, used, to, increase, their, energy, further, to, 450, gev, before, they, are, at, last, injected, over, a, period, of, several, minutes, into, the, main, ring, here, the, proton, bunches, are, accumulated, accelerated, over, a, period, of, 20, minutes, to, their, peak, energy, and, finally, circulated, for, 5, to, 24, hours, while, collisions, occur, at, the, four, intersection, points, the, lhc, physics, programme, is, mainly, based, on, proton, proton, collisions, however, during, shorter, running, periods, typically, one, month, per, year, heavy, ion, collisions, are, included, in, the, programme, while, lighter, ions, are, considered, as, well, the, baseline, scheme, deals, with, lead, ions, see, a, large, ion, collider, experiment, the, lead, ions, are, first, accelerated, by, the, linear, accelerator, linac, 3, and, the, low, energy, ion, ring, leir, is, used, as, an, ion, storage, and, cooler, unit, the, ions, are, then, further, accelerated, by, the, ps, and, sps, before, being, injected, into, lhc, ring, where, they, reach, an, energy, of, 2, 3, tev, per, nucleon, or, 522, tev, per, ion, higher, than, the, energies, reached, by, the, relativistic, heavy, ion, collider, the, aim, of, the, heavy, ion, programme, is, to, investigate, quark, gluon, plasma, which, existed, in, the, early, universe, nine, detectors, have, been, built, in, large, caverns, excavated, at, the, lhc, s, intersection, points, two, of, them, the, atlas, experiment, and, the, compact, muon, solenoid, cms, are, large, general, purpose, particle, detectors, alice, and, lhcb, have, more, specialized, roles, while, the, other, five, totem, moedal, lhcf, snd, and, faser, are, much, smaller, and, are, for, very, specialized, research, the, atlas, and, cms, experiments, discovered, the, higgs, boson, which, is, strong, evidence, that, the, standard, model, has, the, correct, mechanism, of, giving, mass, to, elementary, particles, data, produced, by, lhc, as, well, as, lhc, related, simulation, were, estimated, at, 200, petabytes, per, year, the, lhc, computing, grid, was, constructed, as, part, of, the, lhc, design, to, handle, the, massive, amounts, of, data, expected, for, its, collisions, it, is, an, international, collaborative, project, that, consists, of, a, grid, based, computer, network, infrastructure, initially, connecting, 140, computing, centres, in, 35, countries, over, 170, in, more, than, 40, countries, as, of, 2012, it, was, designed, by, cern, to, handle, the, significant, volume, of, data, produced, by, lhc, experiments, incorporating, both, private, fibre, optic, cable, links, and, existing, high, speed, portions, of, the, public, internet, to, enable, data, transfer, from, cern, to, academic, institutions, around, the, world, the, lhc, computing, grid, consists, of, global, federations, across, europe, asia, pacific, and, the, americas, the, distributed, computing, project, lhc, home, was, started, to, support, the, construction, and, calibration, of, the, lhc, the, project, uses, the, boinc, platform, enabling, anybody, with, an, internet, connection, and, a, computer, running, mac, os, x, windows, or, linux, to, use, their, computer, s, idle, time, to, simulate, how, particles, will, travel, in, the, beam, pipes, with, this, information, the, scientists, are, able, to, determine, how, the, magnets, should, be, calibrated, to, gain, the, most, stable, orbit, of, the, beams, in, the, ring, in, august, 2011, a, second, application, test4theory, went, live, which, performs, simulations, against, which, to, compare, actual, test, data, to, determine, confidence, levels, of, the, results, by, 2012, data, from, over, 6, quadrillion, 6, 10, 15, lhc, proton, proton, collisions, had, been, analysed, the, lhc, computing, grid, had, become, the, world, s, largest, computing, grid, in, 2012, comprising, over, 170, computing, facilities, in, a, worldwide, network, across, more, than, 40, countries, the, lhc, first, went, operational, on, 10, september, 2008, but, initial, testing, was, delayed, for, 14, months, from, 19, september, 2008, to, 20, november, 2009, following, a, magnet, quench, incident, that, caused, extensive, damage, to, over, 50, superconducting, magnets, their, mountings, and, the, vacuum, pipe, during, its, first, run, 2010, 2013, the, lhc, collided, two, opposing, particle, beams, of, either, protons, at, up, to, 4, teraelectronvolts, 4, tev, or, 0, 64, microjoules, or, lead, nuclei, 574, tev, per, nucleus, or, 2, 76, tev, per, nucleon, its, first, run, discoveries, included, the, long, sought, higgs, boson, several, composite, particles, hadrons, like, the, b, 3p, bottomonium, state, the, first, creation, of, a, quark, gluon, plasma, and, the, first, observations, of, the, very, rare, decay, of, the, b, s, meson, into, two, muons, b, s, 0, which, challenged, the, validity, of, existing, models, of, supersymmetry, the, size, of, the, lhc, constitutes, an, exceptional, engineering, challenge, with, unique, operational, issues, on, account, of, the, amount, of, energy, stored, in, the, magnets, and, the, beams, while, operating, the, total, energy, stored, in, the, magnets, is, 10, gj, 2, 400, kilograms, of, tnt, and, the, total, energy, carried, by, the, two, beams, reaches, 724, mj, 173, kilograms, of, tnt, loss, of, only, one, ten, millionth, part, 10, 7, of, the, beam, is, sufficient, to, quench, a, superconducting, magnet, while, each, of, the, two, beam, dumps, must, absorb, 362, mj, 87, kilograms, of, tnt, these, energies, are, carried, by, very, little, matter, under, nominal, operating, conditions, 2, 808, bunches, per, beam, 1, 15, 10, 11, protons, per, bunch, the, beam, pipes, contain, 1, 0, 10, 9, gram, of, hydrogen, which, in, standard, conditions, for, temperature, and, pressure, would, fill, the, volume, of, one, grain, of, fine, sand, with, a, budget, of, 7, 5, billion, about, 9bn, or, 6, 19bn, as, of, june, 2010, the, lhc, is, one, of, the, most, expensive, scientific, instruments, ever, built, the, total, cost, of, the, project, is, expected, to, be, of, the, order, of, 4, 6bn, swiss, francs, sfr, about, 4, 4bn, 3, 1bn, or, 2, 8bn, as, of, january, 2010, for, the, accelerator, and, 1, 16bn, sfr, about, 1, 1bn, 0, 8bn, or, 0, 7bn, as, of, january, 2010, for, the, cern, contribution, to, the, experiments, the, construction, of, lhc, was, approved, in, 1995, with, a, budget, of, sfr, 2, 6bn, with, another, sfr, 210m, toward, the, experiments, however, cost, overruns, estimated, in, a, major, review, in, 2001, at, around, sfr, 480m, for, the, accelerator, and, sfr, 50m, for, the, experiments, along, with, a, reduction, in, cern, s, budget, pushed, the, completion, date, from, 2005, to, april, 2007, the, superconducting, magnets, were, responsible, for, sfr, 180m, of, the, cost, increase, there, were, also, further, costs, and, delays, owing, to, engineering, difficulties, encountered, while, building, the, cavern, for, the, compact, muon, solenoid, and, also, due, to, magnet, supports, which, were, insufficiently, strongly, designed, and, failed, their, initial, testing, 2007, and, damage, from, a, magnet, quench, and, liquid, helium, escape, inaugural, testing, 2008, because, electricity, costs, are, lower, during, the, summer, the, lhc, normally, does, not, operate, over, the, winter, months, although, exceptions, over, the, 2009, 10, and, 2012, 2013, winters, were, made, to, make, up, for, the, 2008, start, up, delays, and, to, improve, precision, of, measurements, of, the, new, particle, discovered, in, 2012, respectively, with, the, 2022, russian, invasion, of, ukraine, the, participation, of, russians, with, cern, was, called, into, question, about, 8, of, the, workforce, are, of, russian, nationality, in, june, 2022, cern, said, the, governing, council, intends, to, terminate, cern, s, cooperation, agreements, with, belarus, and, russia, when, they, expire, respectively, in, june, and, december, 2024, cern, said, it, would, monitor, developments, in, ukraine, and, remains, prepared, to, take, additional, steps, as, warranted, cern, further, said, that, it, would, reduce, the, ukrainian, contribution, to, cern, for, 2022, to, the, amount, already, remitted, to, the, organization, thereby, waiving, the, second, installment, of, the, contribution, in, both, of, its, runs, 2010, to, 2012, and, 2015, the, lhc, was, initially, run, at, energies, below, its, planned, operating, energy, and, ramped, up, to, just, 2, x, 4, tev, energy, on, its, first, run, and, 2, x, 6, 5, tev, on, its, second, run, below, the, design, energy, of, 2, x, 7, tev, this, is, because, massive, superconducting, magnets, require, considerable, magnet, training, to, handle, the, high, currents, involved, without, losing, their, superconducting, ability, and, the, high, currents, are, necessary, to, allow, a, high, proton, energy, the, training, process, involves, repeatedly, running, the, magnets, with, lower, currents, to, provoke, any, quenches, or, minute, movements, that, may, result, it, also, takes, time, to, cool, down, magnets, to, their, operating, temperature, of, around, 1, 9, k, close, to, absolute, zero, over, time, the, magnet, beds, in, and, ceases, to, quench, at, these, lesser, currents, and, can, handle, the, full, design, current, without, quenching, cern, media, describe, the, magnets, as, shaking, out, the, unavoidable, tiny, manufacturing, imperfections, in, their, crystals, and, positions, that, had, initially, impaired, their, ability, to, handle, their, planned, currents, the, magnets, over, time, and, with, training, gradually, become, able, to, handle, their, full, planned, currents, without, quenching, the, first, beam, was, circulated, through, the, collider, on, the, morning, of, 10, september, 2008, cern, successfully, fired, the, protons, around, the, tunnel, in, stages, three, kilometres, at, a, time, the, particles, were, fired, in, a, clockwise, direction, into, the, accelerator, and, successfully, steered, around, it, at, 10, 28, local, time, the, lhc, successfully, completed, its, major, test, after, a, series, of, trial, runs, two, white, dots, flashed, on, a, computer, screen, showing, the, protons, travelled, the, full, length, of, the, collider, it, took, less, than, one, hour, to, guide, the, stream, of, particles, around, its, inaugural, circuit, cern, next, successfully, sent, a, beam, of, protons, in, an, anticlockwise, direction, taking, slightly, longer, at, one, and, a, half, hours, owing, to, a, problem, with, the, cryogenics, with, the, full, circuit, being, completed, at, 14, 59, on, 19, september, 2008, a, magnet, quench, occurred, in, about, 100, bending, magnets, in, sectors, 3, and, 4, where, an, electrical, fault, vented, about, six, tonnes, of, liquid, helium, the, magnets, cryogenic, coolant, into, the, tunnel, the, escaping, vapour, expanded, with, explosive, force, damaging, 53, superconducting, magnets, and, their, mountings, and, contaminating, the, vacuum, pipe, which, also, lost, vacuum, conditions, shortly, after, the, incident, cern, reported, that, the, most, likely, cause, of, the, problem, was, a, faulty, electrical, connection, between, two, magnets, it, estimated, that, repairs, would, take, at, least, two, months, owing, to, the, time, needed, to, warm, up, the, affected, sectors, and, then, cool, them, back, down, to, operating, temperature, cern, released, an, interim, technical, report, and, preliminary, analysis, of, the, incident, on, 15, and, 16, october, 2008, respectively, and, a, more, detailed, report, on, 5, december, 2008, the, analysis, of, the, incident, by, cern, confirmed, that, an, electrical, fault, had, indeed, been, the, cause, the, faulty, electrical, connection, had, led, correctly, to, a, failsafe, power, abort, of, the, electrical, systems, powering, the, superconducting, magnets, but, had, also, caused, an, electric, arc, or, discharge, which, damaged, the, integrity, of, the, supercooled, helium, s, enclosure, and, vacuum, insulation, causing, the, coolant, s, temperature, and, pressure, to, rapidly, rise, beyond, the, ability, of, the, safety, systems, to, contain, it, and, leading, to, a, temperature, rise, of, about, 100, degrees, celsius, in, some, of, the, affected, magnets, energy, stored, in, the, superconducting, magnets, and, electrical, noise, induced, in, other, quench, detectors, also, played, a, role, in, the, rapid, heating, around, two, tonnes, of, liquid, helium, escaped, explosively, before, detectors, triggered, an, emergency, stop, and, a, further, four, tonnes, leaked, at, lower, pressure, in, the, aftermath, a, total, of, 53, magnets, were, damaged, in, the, incident, and, were, repaired, or, replaced, during, the, winter, shutdown, this, accident, was, thoroughly, discussed, in, a, 22, february, 2010, superconductor, science, and, technology, article, by, cern, physicist, lucio, rossi, in, the, original, schedule, for, lhc, commissioning, the, first, modest, high, energy, collisions, at, a, centre, of, mass, energy, of, 900, gev, were, expected, to, take, place, before, the, end, of, september, 2008, and, the, lhc, was, expected, to, be, operating, at, 10, tev, by, the, end, of, 2008, however, owing, to, the, delay, caused, by, the, incident, the, collider, was, not, operational, until, november, 2009, despite, the, delay, lhc, was, officially, inaugurated, on, 21, october, 2008, in, the, presence, of, political, leaders, science, ministers, from, cern, s, 20, member, states, cern, officials, and, members, of, the, worldwide, scientific, community, most, of, 2009, was, spent, on, repairs, and, reviews, from, the, damage, caused, by, the, quench, incident, along, with, two, further, vacuum, leaks, identified, in, july, 2009, this, pushed, the, start, of, operations, to, november, of, that, year, on, 20, november, 2009, low, energy, beams, circulated, in, the, tunnel, for, the, first, time, since, the, incident, and, shortly, after, on, 30, november, the, lhc, achieved, 1, 18, tev, per, beam, to, become, the, world, s, highest, energy, particle, accelerator, beating, the, tevatron, s, previous, record, of, 0, 98, tev, per, beam, held, for, eight, years, the, early, part, of, 2010, saw, the, continued, ramp, up, of, beam, in, energies, and, early, physics, experiments, towards, 3, 5, tev, per, beam, and, on, 30, march, 2010, lhc, set, a, new, record, for, high, energy, collisions, by, colliding, proton, beams, at, a, combined, energy, level, of, 7, tev, the, attempt, was, the, third, that, day, after, two, unsuccessful, attempts, in, which, the, protons, had, to, be, dumped, from, the, collider, and, new, beams, had, to, be, injected, this, also, marked, the, start, of, the, main, research, programme, the, first, proton, run, ended, on, 4, november, 2010, a, run, with, lead, ions, started, on, 8, november, 2010, and, ended, on, 6, december, 2010, allowing, the, alice, experiment, to, study, matter, under, extreme, conditions, similar, to, those, shortly, after, the, big, bang, cern, originally, planned, that, the, lhc, would, run, through, to, the, end, of, 2012, with, a, short, break, at, the, end, of, 2011, to, allow, for, an, increase, in, beam, energy, from, 3, 5, to, 4, tev, per, beam, at, the, end, of, 2012, the, lhc, was, planned, to, be, temporarily, shut, down, until, around, 2015, to, allow, upgrade, to, a, planned, beam, energy, of, 7, tev, per, beam, in, late, 2012, in, light, of, the, july, 2012, discovery, of, the, higgs, boson, the, shutdown, was, postponed, for, some, weeks, into, early, 2013, to, allow, additional, data, to, be, obtained, before, shutdown, the, lhc, was, shut, down, on, 13, february, 2013, for, its, two, year, upgrade, called, long, shutdown, 1, ls1, which, was, to, touch, on, many, aspects, of, the, lhc, enabling, collisions, at, 14, tev, enhancing, its, detectors, and, pre, accelerators, the, proton, synchrotron, and, super, proton, synchrotron, as, well, as, replacing, its, ventilation, system, and, 100, km, 62, mi, of, cabling, impaired, by, high, energy, collisions, from, its, first, run, the, upgraded, collider, began, its, long, start, up, and, testing, process, in, june, 2014, with, the, proton, synchrotron, booster, starting, on, 2, june, 2014, the, final, interconnection, between, magnets, completing, and, the, proton, synchrotron, circulating, particles, on, 18, june, 2014, and, the, first, section, of, the, main, lhc, supermagnet, system, reaching, operating, temperature, of, 1, 9, k, 271, 25, c, a, few, days, later, due, to, the, slow, progress, with, training, the, superconducting, magnets, it, was, decided, to, start, the, second, run, with, a, lower, energy, of, 6, 5, tev, per, beam, corresponding, to, a, current, in, the, magnet, of, 11, 000, amperes, the, first, of, the, main, lhc, magnets, were, reported, to, have, been, successfully, trained, by, 9, december, 2014, while, training, the, other, magnet, sectors, was, finished, in, march, 2015, on, 5, april, 2015, the, lhc, restarted, after, a, two, year, break, during, which, the, electrical, connectors, between, the, bending, magnets, were, upgraded, to, safely, handle, the, current, required, for, 7, tev, per, beam, 14, tev, collision, energy, however, the, bending, magnets, were, only, trained, to, handle, up, to, 6, 5, tev, per, beam, 13, tev, collision, energy, which, became, the, operating, energy, for, 2015, to, 2018, the, energy, was, first, reached, on, 10, april, 2015, the, upgrades, culminated, in, colliding, protons, together, with, a, combined, energy, of, 13, tev, on, 3, june, 2015, the, lhc, started, delivering, physics, data, after, almost, two, years, offline, in, the, following, months, it, was, used, for, proton, proton, collisions, while, in, november, the, machine, switched, to, collisions, of, lead, ions, and, in, december, the, usual, winter, shutdown, started, in, 2016, the, machine, operators, focused, on, increasing, the, luminosity, for, proton, proton, collisions, the, design, value, was, first, reached, 29, june, and, further, improvements, increased, the, collision, rate, to, 40, above, the, design, value, the, total, number, of, collisions, in, 2016, exceeded, the, number, from, run, 1, at, a, higher, energy, per, collision, the, proton, proton, run, was, followed, by, four, weeks, of, proton, lead, collisions, in, 2017, the, luminosity, was, increased, further, and, reached, twice, the, design, value, the, total, number, of, collisions, was, higher, than, in, 2016, as, well, the, 2018, physics, run, began, on, 17, april, and, stopped, on, 3, december, including, four, weeks, of, lead, lead, collisions, long, shutdown, 2, ls2, started, on, 10, december, 2018, the, lhc, and, the, whole, cern, accelerator, complex, was, maintained, and, upgraded, the, goal, of, the, upgrades, was, to, implement, the, high, luminosity, large, hadron, collider, hl, lhc, project, that, will, increase, the, luminosity, by, a, factor, of, 10, ls2, ended, in, april, 2022, the, long, shutdown, 3, ls3, in, the, 2020s, will, take, place, before, the, hl, lhc, project, is, done, lhc, became, operational, again, on, 22, april, 2022, with, a, new, maximum, beam, energy, of, 6, 8, tev, 13, 6, tev, collision, energy, which, was, first, achieved, on, 25, april, it, officially, commenced, its, run, 3, physics, season, on, 5, july, 2022, this, round, is, expected, to, continue, until, 2026, in, addition, to, a, higher, energy, the, lhc, is, expected, to, reach, a, higher, luminosity, which, is, expected, to, increase, even, further, with, the, upgrade, to, the, hl, lhc, after, run, 3, an, initial, focus, of, research, was, to, investigate, the, possible, existence, of, the, higgs, boson, a, key, part, of, the, standard, model, of, physics, which, was, predicted, by, theory, but, had, not, yet, been, observed, before, due, to, its, high, mass, and, elusive, nature, cern, scientists, estimated, that, if, the, standard, model, was, correct, the, lhc, would, produce, several, higgs, bosons, every, minute, allowing, physicists, to, finally, confirm, or, disprove, the, higgs, boson, s, existence, in, addition, the, lhc, allowed, the, search, for, supersymmetric, particles, and, other, hypothetical, particles, as, possible, unknown, areas, of, physics, some, extensions, of, the, standard, model, predict, additional, particles, such, as, the, heavy, w, and, z, gauge, bosons, which, are, also, estimated, to, be, within, reach, of, the, lhc, to, discover, the, first, physics, results, from, the, lhc, involving, 284, collisions, which, took, place, in, the, alice, detector, were, reported, on, 15, december, 2009, the, results, of, the, first, proton, proton, collisions, at, energies, higher, than, fermilab, s, tevatron, proton, antiproton, collisions, were, published, by, the, cms, collaboration, in, early, february, 2010, yielding, greater, than, predicted, charged, hadron, production, after, the, first, year, of, data, collection, the, lhc, experimental, collaborations, started, to, release, their, preliminary, results, concerning, searches, for, new, physics, beyond, the, standard, model, in, proton, proton, collisions, no, evidence, of, new, particles, was, detected, in, the, 2010, data, as, a, result, bounds, were, set, on, the, allowed, parameter, space, of, various, extensions, of, the, standard, model, such, as, models, with, large, extra, dimensions, constrained, versions, of, the, minimal, supersymmetric, standard, model, and, others, on, 24, may, 2011, it, was, reported, that, quark, gluon, plasma, the, densest, matter, thought, to, exist, besides, black, holes, had, been, created, in, the, lhc, between, july, and, august, 2011, results, of, searches, for, the, higgs, boson, and, for, exotic, particles, based, on, the, data, collected, during, the, first, half, of, the, 2011, run, were, presented, in, conferences, in, grenoble, and, mumbai, in, the, latter, conference, it, was, reported, that, despite, hints, of, a, higgs, signal, in, earlier, data, atlas, and, cms, exclude, with, 95, confidence, level, using, the, cls, method, the, existence, of, a, higgs, boson, with, the, properties, predicted, by, the, standard, model, over, most, of, the, mass, region, between, 145, and, 466, gev, the, searches, for, new, particles, did, not, yield, signals, either, allowing, to, further, constrain, the, parameter, space, of, various, extensions, of, the, standard, model, including, its, supersymmetric, extensions, on, 13, december, 2011, cern, reported, that, the, standard, model, higgs, boson, if, it, exists, is, most, likely, to, have, a, mass, constrained, to, the, range, 115, 130, gev, both, the, cms, and, atlas, detectors, have, also, shown, intensity, peaks, in, the, 124, 125, gev, range, consistent, with, either, background, noise, or, the, observation, of, the, higgs, boson, on, 22, december, 2011, it, was, reported, that, a, new, composite, particle, had, been, observed, the, b, 3p, bottomonium, state, on, 4, july, 2012, both, the, cms, and, atlas, teams, announced, the, discovery, of, a, boson, in, the, mass, region, around, 125, 126, gev, with, a, statistical, significance, at, the, level, of, 5, sigma, each, this, meets, the, formal, level, required, to, announce, a, new, particle, the, observed, properties, were, consistent, with, the, higgs, boson, but, scientists, were, cautious, as, to, whether, it, is, formally, identified, as, actually, being, the, higgs, boson, pending, further, analysis, on, 14, march, 2013, cern, announced, confirmation, that, the, observed, particle, was, indeed, the, predicted, higgs, boson, on, 8, november, 2012, the, lhcb, team, reported, on, an, experiment, seen, as, a, golden, test, of, supersymmetry, theories, in, physics, by, measuring, the, very, rare, decay, of, the, b, s, displaystyle, b, s, meson, into, two, muons, b, s, 0, displaystyle, b, s, 0, rightarrow, mu, mu, the, results, which, match, those, predicted, by, the, non, supersymmetrical, standard, model, rather, than, the, predictions, of, many, branches, of, supersymmetry, show, the, decays, are, less, common, than, some, forms, of, supersymmetry, predict, though, could, still, match, the, predictions, of, other, versions, of, supersymmetry, theory, the, results, as, initially, drafted, are, stated, to, be, short, of, proof, but, at, a, relatively, high, 3, 5, sigma, level, of, significance, the, result, was, later, confirmed, by, the, cms, collaboration, in, august, 2013, the, lhcb, team, revealed, an, anomaly, in, the, angular, distribution, of, b, meson, decay, products, which, could, not, be, predicted, by, the, standard, model, this, anomaly, had, a, statistical, certainty, of, 4, 5, sigma, just, short, of, the, 5, sigma, needed, to, be, officially, recognized, as, a, discovery, it, is, unknown, what, the, cause, of, this, anomaly, would, be, although, the, z, boson, has, been, suggested, as, a, possible, candidate, on, 19, november, 2014, the, lhcb, experiment, announced, the, discovery, of, two, new, heavy, subatomic, particles, b, and, b, both, of, them, are, baryons, that, are, composed, of, one, bottom, one, down, and, one, strange, quark, they, are, excited, states, of, the, bottom, xi, baryon, the, lhcb, collaboration, has, observed, multiple, exotic, hadrons, possibly, pentaquarks, or, tetraquarks, in, the, run, 1, data, on, 4, april, 2014, the, collaboration, confirmed, the, existence, of, the, tetraquark, candidate, z, 4430, with, a, significance, of, over, 13, 9, sigma, on, 13, july, 2015, results, consistent, with, pentaquark, states, in, the, decay, of, bottom, lambda, baryons, 0, b, were, reported, on, 28, june, 2016, the, collaboration, announced, four, tetraquark, like, particles, decaying, into, a, j, and, a, meson, only, one, of, which, was, well, established, before, x, 4274, x, 4500, and, x, 4700, and, x, 4140, in, december, 2016, atlas, presented, a, measurement, of, the, w, boson, mass, researching, the, precision, of, analyses, done, at, the, tevatron, at, the, conference, eps, hep, 2015, in, july, the, collaborations, presented, first, cross, section, measurements, of, several, particles, at, the, higher, collision, energy, on, 15, december, 2015, the, atlas, and, cms, experiments, both, reported, a, number, of, preliminary, results, for, higgs, physics, supersymmetry, susy, searches, and, exotics, searches, using, 13, tev, proton, collision, data, both, experiments, saw, a, moderate, excess, around, 750, gev, in, the, two, photon, invariant, mass, spectrum, but, the, experiments, did, not, confirm, the, existence, of, the, hypothetical, particle, in, an, august, 2016, report, in, july, 2017, many, analyses, based, on, the, large, dataset, collected, in, 2016, were, shown, the, properties, of, the, higgs, boson, were, studied, in, more, detail, and, the, precision, of, many, other, results, was, improved, as, of, march, 2021, the, lhc, experiments, have, discovered, 59, new, hadrons, in, the, data, collected, during, the, first, two, runs, on, 5, july, 2022, lhcb, reported, the, discovery, of, a, new, type, of, pentaquark, made, up, of, a, charm, quark, and, a, charm, antiquark, and, an, up, a, down, and, a, strange, quark, observed, in, an, analysis, of, decays, of, charged, b, mesons, after, some, years, of, running, any, particle, physics, experiment, typically, begins, to, suffer, from, diminishing, returns, as, the, key, results, reachable, by, the, device, begin, to, be, completed, later, years, of, operation, discover, proportionately, less, than, earlier, years, a, common, response, is, to, upgrade, the, devices, involved, typically, in, collision, energy, luminosity, or, improved, detectors, in, addition, to, a, possible, increase, to, 14, tev, collision, energy, a, luminosity, upgrade, of, the, lhc, called, the, high, luminosity, large, hadron, collider, started, in, june, 2018, that, will, boost, the, accelerator, s, potential, for, new, discoveries, in, physics, starting, in, 2027, the, upgrade, aims, at, increasing, the, luminosity, of, the, machine, by, a, factor, of, 10, up, to, 10, 35, cm, 2, s, 1, providing, a, better, chance, to, see, rare, processes, and, improving, statistically, marginal, measurements, cern, has, several, preliminary, designs, for, a, future, circular, collider, fcc, which, would, be, the, most, powerful, particle, accelerator, ever, built, with, different, types, of, collider, ranging, in, cost, from, around, 9, billion, us, 10, 2, billion, to, 21, billion, it, would, use, the, lhc, ring, as, preaccelerator, similar, to, how, the, lhc, uses, the, smaller, super, proton, synchrotron, it, is, cern, s, opening, bid, in, a, priority, setting, process, called, the, european, strategy, for, particle, physics, update, and, will, affect, the, field, s, future, well, into, the, second, half, of, the, century, as, of, 2023, no, fixed, plan, exists, and, it, is, unknown, if, the, construction, will, be, funded, the, experiments, at, the, large, hadron, collider, sparked, fears, that, the, particle, collisions, might, produce, doomsday, phenomena, involving, the, production, of, stable, microscopic, black, holes, or, the, creation, of, hypothetical, particles, called, strangelets, two, cern, commissioned, safety, reviews, examined, these, concerns, and, concluded, that, the, experiments, at, the, lhc, present, no, danger, and, that, there, is, no, reason, for, concern, a, conclusion, endorsed, by, the, american, physical, society, the, reports, also, noted, that, the, physical, conditions, and, collision, events, that, exist, in, the, lhc, and, similar, experiments, occur, naturally, and, routinely, in, the, universe, without, hazardous, consequences, including, ultra, high, energy, cosmic, rays, observed, to, impact, earth, with, energies, far, higher, than, those, in, any, human, made, collider, like, the, oh, my, god, particle, which, had, 320, million, tev, of, energy, and, a, collision, energy, tens, of, times, more, than, the, most, energetic, collisions, produced, in, the, lhc, the, large, hadron, collider, gained, a, considerable, amount, of, attention, from, outside, the, scientific, community, and, its, progress, is, followed, by, most, popular,
