atmospheric, science, is, the, study, of, the, earth, s, atmosphere, and, its, various, inner, working, physical, processes, meteorology, includes, atmospheric, chemistry, and, atmospheric, physics, with, a, major, focus, on, weather, forecasting, climatology, is, the, study, of, atmospheric, changes, both, long, and, short, term, that, define, average, climates, and, their, change, over, time, climate, variability, aeronomy, is, the, study, of, the, upper, layers, of, the, atmosphere, where, dissociation, and, ionization, are, important, atmospheric, science, has, been, extended, to, the, field, of, planetary, science, and, the, study, of, the, atmospheres, of, the, planets, and, natural, satellites, of, the, solar, system, experimental, instruments, used, in, atmospheric, science, include, satellites, rocketsondes, radiosondes, weather, balloons, radars, and, lasers, the, term, aerology, from, greek, a, r, air, and, logia, is, sometimes, used, as, an, alternative, term, for, the, study, of, earth, s, atmosphere, in, other, definitions, aerology, is, restricted, to, the, free, atmosphere, the, region, above, the, planetary, boundary, layer, early, pioneers, in, the, field, include, l, on, teisserenc, de, bort, and, richard, assmann, atmospheric, chemistry, is, a, branch, of, atmospheric, science, in, which, the, chemistry, of, the, earth, s, atmosphere, and, that, of, other, planets, is, studied, it, is, a, multidisciplinary, field, of, research, and, draws, on, environmental, chemistry, physics, meteorology, computer, modeling, oceanography, geology, and, volcanology, and, other, disciplines, research, is, increasingly, connected, with, other, areas, of, study, such, as, climatology, the, composition, and, chemistry, of, the, atmosphere, is, of, importance, for, several, reasons, but, primarily, because, of, the, interactions, between, the, atmosphere, and, living, organisms, the, composition, of, the, earth, s, atmosphere, has, been, changed, by, human, activity, and, some, of, these, changes, are, harmful, to, human, health, crops, and, ecosystems, examples, of, problems, which, have, been, addressed, by, atmospheric, chemistry, include, acid, rain, photochemical, smog, and, global, warming, atmospheric, chemistry, seeks, to, understand, the, causes, of, these, problems, and, by, obtaining, a, theoretical, understanding, of, them, allow, possible, solutions, to, be, tested, and, the, effects, of, changes, in, government, policy, evaluated, atmospheric, dynamics, is, the, study, of, motion, systems, of, meteorological, importance, integrating, observations, at, multiple, locations, and, times, and, theories, common, topics, studied, include, diverse, phenomena, such, as, thunderstorms, tornadoes, gravity, waves, tropical, cyclones, extratropical, cyclones, jet, streams, and, global, scale, circulations, the, goal, of, dynamical, studies, is, to, explain, the, observed, circulations, on, the, basis, of, fundamental, principles, from, physics, the, objectives, of, such, studies, incorporate, improving, weather, forecasting, developing, methods, for, predicting, seasonal, and, interannual, climate, fluctuations, and, understanding, the, implications, of, human, induced, perturbations, e, g, increased, carbon, dioxide, concentrations, or, depletion, of, the, ozone, layer, on, the, global, climate, atmospheric, physics, is, the, application, of, physics, to, the, study, of, the, atmosphere, atmospheric, physicists, attempt, to, model, earth, s, atmosphere, and, the, atmospheres, of, the, other, planets, using, fluid, flow, equations, chemical, models, radiation, balancing, and, energy, transfer, processes, in, the, atmosphere, and, underlying, oceans, and, land, in, order, to, model, weather, systems, atmospheric, physicists, employ, elements, of, scattering, theory, wave, propagation, models, cloud, physics, statistical, mechanics, and, spatial, statistics, each, of, which, incorporate, high, levels, of, mathematics, and, physics, atmospheric, physics, has, close, links, to, meteorology, and, climatology, and, also, covers, the, design, and, construction, of, instruments, for, studying, the, atmosphere, and, the, interpretation, of, the, data, they, provide, including, remote, sensing, instruments, in, the, united, kingdom, atmospheric, studies, are, underpinned, by, the, meteorological, office, divisions, of, the, u, s, national, oceanic, and, atmospheric, administration, noaa, oversee, research, projects, and, weather, modeling, involving, atmospheric, physics, the, u, s, national, astronomy, and, ionosphere, center, also, carries, out, studies, of, the, high, atmosphere, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, and, the, solar, wind, interact, with, the, atmosphere, creating, the, ionosphere, van, allen, radiation, belts, telluric, currents, and, radiant, energy, is, a, science, that, bases, its, more, general, knowledge, of, the, more, specialized, disciplines, of, meteorology, oceanography, geology, and, astronomy, which, in, turn, are, based, on, the, basic, sciences, of, physics, chemistry, and, mathematics, in, contrast, to, meteorology, which, studies, short, term, weather, systems, lasting, up, to, a, few, weeks, climatology, studies, the, frequency, and, trends, of, those, systems, it, studies, the, periodicity, of, weather, events, over, years, to, millennia, as, well, as, changes, in, long, term, average, weather, patterns, in, relation, to, atmospheric, conditions, climatologists, those, who, practice, climatology, study, both, the, nature, of, climates, local, regional, or, global, and, the, natural, or, human, induced, factors, that, cause, climates, to, change, climatology, considers, the, past, and, tries, to, predict, future, climate, change, phenomena, of, climatological, interest, include, the, atmospheric, boundary, layer, circulation, patterns, heat, transfer, radiative, convective, and, latent, interactions, between, the, atmosphere, and, the, oceans, and, land, surface, particularly, vegetation, land, use, and, topography, and, the, chemical, and, physical, composition, of, the, atmosphere, related, disciplines, include, astrophysics, atmospheric, physics, chemistry, ecology, physical, geography, geology, geophysics, glaciology, hydrology, oceanography, and, volcanology, aeronomy, is, the, scientific, study, of, the, upper, atmosphere, of, the, earth, the, atmospheric, layers, above, the, stratopause, and, corresponding, regions, of, the, atmospheres, of, other, planets, where, the, entire, atmosphere, may, correspond, to, the, earth, s, upper, atmosphere, or, a, portion, of, it, a, branch, of, both, atmospheric, chemistry, and, atmospheric, physics, aeronomy, contrasts, with, meteorology, which, focuses, on, the, layers, of, the, atmosphere, below, the, stratopause, in, atmospheric, regions, studied, by, aeronomers, chemical, dissociation, and, ionization, are, important, phenomena, all, of, the, solar, system, s, planets, have, atmospheres, this, is, because, their, gravity, is, strong, enough, to, keep, gaseous, particles, close, to, the, surface, larger, gas, giants, are, massive, enough, to, keep, large, amounts, of, the, light, gases, hydrogen, and, helium, close, by, while, the, smaller, planets, lose, these, gases, into, space, the, composition, of, the, earth, s, atmosphere, is, different, from, the, other, planets, because, the, various, life, processes, that, have, transpired, on, the, planet, have, introduced, free, molecular, oxygen, much, of, mercury, s, atmosphere, has, been, blasted, away, by, the, solar, wind, the, only, moon, that, has, retained, a, dense, atmosphere, is, titan, there, is, a, thin, atmosphere, on, triton, and, a, trace, of, an, atmosphere, on, the, moon, planetary, atmospheres, are, affected, by, the, varying, degrees, of, energy, received, from, either, the, sun, or, their, interiors, leading, to, the, formation, of, dynamic, weather, systems, such, as, hurricanes, on, earth, planet, wide, dust, storms, on, mars, an, earth, sized, anticyclone, on, jupiter, called, the, great, red, spot, and, holes, in, the, atmosphere, on, neptune, at, least, one, extrasolar, planet, hd, 189733, b, has, been, claimed, to, possess, such, a, weather, system, similar, to, the, great, red, spot, but, twice, as, large, hot, jupiters, have, been, shown, to, be, losing, their, atmospheres, into, space, due, to, stellar, radiation, much, like, the, tails, of, comets, these, planets, may, have, vast, differences, in, temperature, between, their, day, and, night, sides, which, produce, supersonic, winds, although, the, day, and, night, sides, of, hd, 189733b, appear, to, have, very, similar, temperatures, indicating, that, planet, s, atmosphere, effectively, redistributes, the, star, s, energy, around, the, planet
