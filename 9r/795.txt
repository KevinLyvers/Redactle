thermohaline, circulation, thc, is, a, part, of, the, large, scale, ocean, circulation, that, is, driven, by, global, density, gradients, created, by, surface, heat, and, freshwater, fluxes, the, adjective, thermohaline, derives, from, thermo, referring, to, temperature, and, haline, referring, to, salt, content, factors, which, together, determine, the, density, of, sea, water, wind, driven, surface, currents, such, as, the, gulf, stream, travel, polewards, from, the, equatorial, atlantic, ocean, cooling, en, route, and, eventually, sinking, at, high, latitudes, forming, north, atlantic, deep, water, this, dense, water, then, flows, into, the, ocean, basins, while, the, bulk, of, it, upwells, in, the, southern, ocean, the, oldest, waters, with, a, transit, time, of, about, 1000, years, upwell, in, the, north, pacific, extensive, mixing, therefore, takes, place, between, the, ocean, basins, reducing, differences, between, them, and, making, the, earth, s, oceans, a, global, system, the, water, in, these, circuits, transport, both, energy, in, the, form, of, heat, and, mass, dissolved, solids, and, gases, around, the, globe, as, such, the, state, of, the, circulation, has, a, large, impact, on, the, climate, of, the, earth, the, thermohaline, circulation, is, sometimes, called, the, ocean, conveyor, belt, the, great, ocean, conveyor, or, the, global, conveyor, belt, coined, by, climate, scientist, wallace, smith, broecker, it, is, also, referred, to, as, the, meridional, overturning, circulation, or, moc, this, name, is, used, because, not, every, circulation, pattern, caused, by, temperature, and, salinity, gradients, is, necessarily, part, of, a, single, global, circulation, further, it, is, difficult, to, separate, the, parts, of, the, circulation, driven, by, temperature, and, salinity, alone, from, those, driven, by, other, factors, such, as, the, wind, and, tidal, forces, this, global, circulation, has, two, major, limbs, atlantic, meridional, overturning, circulation, amoc, centered, in, the, north, atlantic, ocean, and, southern, ocean, overturning, circulation, or, southern, ocean, meridional, circulation, smoc, around, antarctica, because, 90, of, the, human, population, lives, in, the, northern, hemisphere, the, amoc, has, been, far, better, studied, but, both, are, very, important, for, the, global, climate, both, of, them, also, appear, to, be, slowing, down, due, to, climate, change, as, the, melting, of, the, ice, sheets, dilutes, salty, flows, such, as, the, antarctic, bottom, water, either, one, could, outright, collapse, to, a, much, weaker, state, which, would, be, an, example, of, tipping, points, in, the, climate, system, the, hemisphere, which, experiences, the, collapse, of, its, circulation, would, experience, less, precipitation, and, become, drier, while, the, other, hemisphere, would, become, wetter, marine, ecosystems, are, also, likely, to, receive, fewer, nutrients, and, experience, greater, ocean, deoxygenation, in, the, northern, hemisphere, amoc, s, collapse, would, also, substantially, lower, the, temperatures, in, many, european, countries, while, the, east, coast, of, north, america, would, experience, accelerated, sea, level, rise, the, collapse, of, either, circulation, is, generally, believed, to, be, more, than, a, century, away, and, may, only, occur, under, high, warming, but, there, is, a, lot, of, uncertainty, about, these, projections, it, has, long, been, known, that, wind, can, drive, ocean, currents, but, only, at, the, surface, in, the, 19th, century, some, oceanographers, suggested, that, the, convection, of, heat, could, drive, deeper, currents, in, 1908, johan, sandstr, m, performed, a, series, of, experiments, at, a, born, marine, research, station, which, proved, that, the, currents, driven, by, thermal, energy, transfer, exist, but, require, that, heating, occurs, at, a, greater, depth, than, cooling, normally, the, opposite, occurs, because, ocean, water, is, heated, from, above, by, the, sun, and, becomes, less, dense, so, the, surface, layer, floats, on, the, surface, above, the, cooler, denser, layers, resulting, in, ocean, stratification, however, wind, and, tides, cause, mixing, between, these, water, layers, with, diapycnal, mixing, caused, by, tidal, currents, being, one, example, this, mixing, is, what, enables, the, convection, between, ocean, layers, and, thus, deep, water, currents, in, the, 1920s, sandstr, m, s, framework, was, expanded, by, accounting, for, the, role, of, salinity, in, ocean, layer, formation, salinity, is, important, because, like, temperature, it, affects, water, density, water, becomes, less, dense, as, its, temperature, increases, and, the, distance, between, its, molecules, expands, but, more, dense, as, the, salinity, increases, since, there, is, a, larger, mass, of, salts, dissolved, within, that, water, further, while, fresh, water, is, at, its, most, dense, at, 4, c, seawater, only, gets, denser, as, it, cools, up, until, it, reaches, the, freezing, point, that, freezing, point, is, also, lower, than, for, fresh, water, due, to, salinity, and, can, be, below, 2, c, depending, on, salinity, and, pressure, these, density, differences, caused, by, temperature, and, salinity, ultimately, separate, ocean, water, into, distinct, water, masses, such, as, the, north, atlantic, deep, water, nadw, and, antarctic, bottom, water, aabw, these, two, waters, are, the, main, drivers, of, the, circulation, which, was, established, in, 1960, by, henry, stommel, and, arnold, b, arons, they, have, chemical, temperature, and, isotopic, ratio, signatures, such, as, 231, pa, 230, th, ratios, which, can, be, traced, their, flow, rate, calculated, and, their, age, determined, nadw, is, formed, because, north, atlantic, is, a, rare, place, in, the, ocean, where, precipitation, which, adds, fresh, water, to, the, ocean, and, so, reduces, its, salinity, is, outweighed, by, evaporation, in, part, due, to, high, windiness, when, water, evaporates, it, leaves, salt, behind, and, so, the, surface, waters, of, the, north, atlantic, are, particularly, salty, north, atlantic, is, also, an, already, cool, region, and, evaporative, cooling, reduces, water, temperature, even, further, thus, this, water, sinks, downward, in, the, norwegian, sea, fills, the, arctic, ocean, basin, and, spills, southwards, through, the, greenland, scotland, ridge, crevasses, in, the, submarine, sills, that, connect, greenland, iceland, and, great, britain, it, cannot, flow, towards, the, pacific, ocean, due, to, the, narrow, shallows, of, the, bering, strait, but, it, does, slowly, flow, into, the, deep, abyssal, plains, of, the, south, atlantic, in, the, southern, ocean, strong, katabatic, winds, blowing, from, the, antarctic, continent, onto, the, ice, shelves, will, blow, the, newly, formed, sea, ice, away, opening, polynyas, in, locations, such, as, weddell, and, ross, seas, off, the, ad, lie, coast, and, by, cape, darnley, the, ocean, no, longer, protected, by, sea, ice, suffers, a, brutal, and, strong, cooling, see, polynya, meanwhile, sea, ice, starts, reforming, so, the, surface, waters, also, get, saltier, hence, very, dense, in, fact, the, formation, of, sea, ice, contributes, to, an, increase, in, surface, seawater, salinity, saltier, brine, is, left, behind, as, the, sea, ice, forms, around, it, pure, water, preferentially, being, frozen, increasing, salinity, lowers, the, freezing, point, of, seawater, so, cold, liquid, brine, is, formed, in, inclusions, within, a, honeycomb, of, ice, the, brine, progressively, melts, the, ice, just, beneath, it, eventually, dripping, out, of, the, ice, matrix, and, sinking, this, process, is, known, as, brine, rejection, the, resulting, antarctic, bottom, water, sinks, and, flows, north, and, east, it, is, denser, than, the, nadw, and, so, flows, beneath, it, aabw, formed, in, the, weddell, sea, will, mainly, fill, the, atlantic, and, indian, basins, whereas, the, aabw, formed, in, the, ross, sea, will, flow, towards, the, pacific, ocean, at, the, indian, ocean, a, vertical, exchange, of, a, lower, layer, of, cold, and, salty, water, from, the, atlantic, and, the, warmer, and, fresher, upper, ocean, water, from, the, tropical, pacific, occurs, in, what, is, known, as, overturning, in, the, pacific, ocean, the, rest, of, the, cold, and, salty, water, from, the, atlantic, undergoes, haline, forcing, and, becomes, warmer, and, fresher, more, quickly, the, out, flowing, undersea, of, cold, and, salty, water, makes, the, sea, level, of, the, atlantic, slightly, lower, than, the, pacific, and, salinity, or, halinity, of, water, at, the, atlantic, higher, than, the, pacific, this, generates, a, large, but, slow, flow, of, warmer, and, fresher, upper, ocean, water, from, the, tropical, pacific, to, the, indian, ocean, through, the, indonesian, archipelago, to, replace, the, cold, and, salty, antarctic, bottom, water, this, is, also, known, as, haline, forcing, net, high, latitude, freshwater, gain, and, low, latitude, evaporation, this, warmer, fresher, water, from, the, pacific, flows, up, through, the, south, atlantic, to, greenland, where, it, cools, off, and, undergoes, evaporative, cooling, and, sinks, to, the, ocean, floor, providing, a, continuous, thermohaline, circulation, as, the, deep, waters, sink, into, the, ocean, basins, they, displace, the, older, deep, water, masses, which, gradually, become, less, dense, due, to, continued, ocean, mixing, thus, some, water, is, rising, in, what, is, known, as, upwelling, its, speeds, are, very, slow, even, compared, to, the, movement, of, the, bottom, water, masses, it, is, therefore, difficult, to, measure, where, upwelling, occurs, using, current, speeds, given, all, the, other, wind, driven, processes, going, on, in, the, surface, ocean, deep, waters, have, their, own, chemical, signature, formed, from, the, breakdown, of, particulate, matter, falling, into, them, over, the, course, of, their, long, journey, at, depth, a, number, of, scientists, have, tried, to, use, these, tracers, to, infer, where, the, upwelling, occurs, wallace, broecker, using, box, models, has, asserted, that, the, bulk, of, deep, upwelling, occurs, in, the, north, pacific, using, as, evidence, the, high, values, of, silicon, found, in, these, waters, other, investigators, have, not, found, such, clear, evidence, computer, models, of, ocean, circulation, increasingly, place, most, of, the, deep, upwelling, in, the, southern, ocean, associated, with, the, strong, winds, in, the, open, latitudes, between, south, america, and, antarctica, direct, estimates, of, the, strength, of, the, thermohaline, circulation, have, also, been, madeat, 26, 5, n, in, the, north, atlantic, by, the, uk, us, rapid, programme, it, combines, direct, estimates, of, ocean, transport, using, current, meters, and, subsea, cable, measurements, with, estimates, of, the, geostrophic, current, from, temperature, and, salinity, measurements, to, provide, continuous, full, depth, basin, wide, estimates, of, the, meridional, overturning, circulation, however, it, has, only, been, operating, since, 2004, which, is, too, short, when, the, timescale, of, the, circulation, is, measured, in, centuries, the, thermohaline, circulation, plays, an, important, role, in, supplying, heat, to, the, polar, regions, and, thus, in, regulating, the, amount, of, sea, ice, in, these, regions, although, poleward, heat, transport, outside, the, tropics, is, considerably, larger, in, the, atmosphere, than, in, the, ocean, changes, in, the, thermohaline, circulation, are, thought, to, have, significant, impacts, on, the, earth, s, radiation, budget, large, influxes, of, low, density, meltwater, from, lake, agassiz, and, deglaciation, in, north, america, are, thought, to, have, led, to, a, shifting, of, deep, water, formation, and, subsidence, in, the, extreme, north, atlantic, and, caused, the, climate, period, in, europe, known, as, the, younger, dryas, in, 2021, the, ipcc, sixth, assessment, report, again, said, the, amoc, is, very, likely, to, decline, within, the, 21st, century, and, that, there, was, a, high, confidence, changes, to, it, would, be, reversible, within, centuries, if, warming, was, reversed, 19, unlike, the, fifth, assessment, report, it, had, only, medium, confidence, rather, than, high, confidence, in, the, amoc, avoiding, a, collapse, before, the, end, of, the, 21st, century, this, reduction, in, confidence, was, likely, influenced, by, several, review, studies, that, draw, attention, to, the, circulation, stability, bias, within, general, circulation, models, and, simplified, ocean, modelling, studies, suggesting, the, amoc, may, be, more, vulnerable, to, abrupt, change, than, larger, scale, models, suggest, as, of, 2024, there, is, no, consensus, on, whether, a, consistent, slowing, of, the, amoc, circulation, has, occurred, but, there, is, little, doubt, it, will, occur, in, the, event, of, continued, climate, change, according, to, the, ipcc, the, most, likely, effects, of, future, amoc, decline, are, reduced, precipitation, in, mid, latitudes, changing, patterns, of, strong, precipitation, in, the, tropics, and, europe, and, strengthening, storms, that, follow, the, north, atlantic, track, in, 2020, research, found, a, weakened, amoc, would, slow, the, decline, in, arctic, sea, ice, and, result, in, atmospheric, trends, similar, to, those, that, likely, occurred, during, the, younger, dryas, such, as, a, southward, displacement, of, intertropical, convergence, zone, changes, in, precipitation, under, high, emissions, scenarios, would, be, far, larger, additionally, the, main, controlling, pattern, of, the, extratropical, southern, hemisphere, s, climate, is, the, southern, annular, mode, sam, which, has, been, spending, more, and, more, years, in, its, positive, phase, due, to, climate, change, as, well, as, the, aftermath, of, ozone, depletion, which, means, more, warming, and, more, precipitation, over, the, ocean, due, to, stronger, westerlies, freshening, the, southern, ocean, further, 1240, climate, models, currently, disagree, on, whether, the, southern, ocean, circulation, would, continue, to, respond, to, changes, in, sam, the, way, it, does, now, or, if, it, will, eventually, adjust, to, them, as, of, early, 2020s, their, best, limited, confidence, estimate, is, that, the, lower, cell, would, continue, to, weaken, while, the, upper, cell, may, strengthen, by, around, 20, over, the, 21st, century, a, key, reason, for, the, uncertainty, is, the, poor, and, inconsistent, representation, of, ocean, stratification, in, even, the, cmip6, models, the, most, advanced, generation, available, as, of, early, 2020s, further, the, largest, long, term, role, in, the, state, of, the, circulation, is, played, by, antarctic, meltwater, and, antarctic, ice, loss, had, been, the, least, certain, aspect, of, future, sea, level, rise, projections, for, a, long, time
