the, ohm, symbol, the, uppercase, greek, letter, omega, is, the, unit, of, electrical, resistance, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, it, is, named, after, german, physicist, georg, ohm, various, empirically, derived, standard, units, for, electrical, resistance, were, developed, in, connection, with, early, telegraphy, practice, and, the, british, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, proposed, a, unit, derived, from, existing, units, of, mass, length, and, time, and, of, a, convenient, scale, for, practical, work, as, early, as, 1861, following, the, 2019, revision, of, the, si, in, which, the, ampere, and, the, kilogram, were, redefined, in, terms, of, fundamental, constants, the, ohm, is, now, also, defined, as, an, exact, value, in, terms, of, these, constants, the, ohm, is, defined, as, an, electrical, resistance, between, two, points, of, a, conductor, when, a, constant, potential, difference, of, one, volt, v, applied, to, these, points, produces, in, the, conductor, a, current, of, one, ampere, a, the, conductor, not, being, the, seat, of, any, electromotive, force, in, which, the, following, additional, units, appear, siemens, s, watt, w, second, s, farad, f, henry, h, weber, wb, joule, j, coulomb, c, kilogram, kg, and, meter, m, in, many, cases, the, resistance, of, a, conductor, is, approximately, constant, within, a, certain, range, of, voltages, temperatures, and, other, parameters, these, are, called, linear, resistors, in, other, cases, resistance, varies, such, as, in, the, case, of, the, thermistor, which, exhibits, a, strong, dependence, of, its, resistance, with, temperature, in, the, us, a, double, vowel, in, the, prefixed, units, kiloohm, and, megaohm, is, commonly, simplified, producing, kilohm, and, megohm, in, alternating, current, circuits, electrical, impedance, is, also, measured, in, ohms, the, siemens, s, is, the, si, derived, unit, of, electric, conductance, and, admittance, historically, known, as, the, mho, ohm, spelled, backwards, symbol, is, it, is, the, reciprocal, of, the, ohm, 1, s, 1, 1, the, power, dissipated, by, a, resistor, may, be, calculated, from, its, resistance, and, the, voltage, or, current, involved, the, formula, is, a, combination, of, ohm, s, law, and, joule, s, law, p, v, i, v, 2, r, i, 2, r, displaystyle, p, vi, frac, v, 2, r, i, 2, r, where, p, is, the, power, r, is, the, resistance, v, is, the, voltage, across, the, resistor, and, i, is, the, current, through, the, resistor, a, linear, resistor, has, a, constant, resistance, value, over, all, applied, voltages, or, currents, many, practical, resistors, are, linear, over, a, useful, range, of, currents, non, linear, resistors, have, a, value, that, may, vary, depending, on, the, applied, voltage, or, current, where, alternating, current, is, applied, to, the, circuit, or, where, the, resistance, value, is, a, function, of, time, the, relation, above, is, true, at, any, instant, but, calculation, of, average, power, over, an, interval, of, time, requires, integration, of, instantaneous, power, over, that, interval, since, the, ohm, belongs, to, a, coherent, system, of, units, when, each, of, these, quantities, has, its, corresponding, si, unit, watt, for, p, ohm, for, r, volt, for, v, and, ampere, for, i, which, are, related, as, in, definition, this, formula, remains, valid, numerically, when, these, units, are, used, and, thought, of, as, being, cancelled, or, omitted, the, rapid, rise, of, electrotechnology, in, the, last, half, of, the, 19th, century, created, a, demand, for, a, rational, coherent, consistent, and, international, system, of, units, for, electrical, quantities, telegraphers, and, other, early, users, of, electricity, in, the, 19th, century, needed, a, practical, standard, unit, of, measurement, for, resistance, resistance, was, often, expressed, as, a, multiple, of, the, resistance, of, a, standard, length, of, telegraph, wires, different, agencies, used, different, bases, for, a, standard, so, units, were, not, readily, interchangeable, electrical, units, so, defined, were, not, a, coherent, system, with, the, units, for, energy, mass, length, and, time, requiring, conversion, factors, to, be, used, in, calculations, relating, energy, or, power, to, resistance, two, different, methods, of, establishing, a, system, of, electrical, units, can, be, chosen, various, artifacts, such, as, a, length, of, wire, or, a, standard, electrochemical, cell, could, be, specified, as, producing, defined, quantities, for, resistance, voltage, and, so, on, alternatively, the, electrical, units, can, be, related, to, the, mechanical, units, by, defining, for, example, a, unit, of, current, that, gives, a, specified, force, between, two, wires, or, a, unit, of, charge, that, gives, a, unit, of, force, between, two, unit, charges, this, latter, method, ensures, coherence, with, the, units, of, energy, defining, a, unit, for, resistance, that, is, coherent, with, units, of, energy, and, time, in, effect, also, requires, defining, units, for, potential, and, current, it, is, desirable, that, one, unit, of, electrical, potential, will, force, one, unit, of, electric, current, through, one, unit, of, electrical, resistance, doing, one, unit, of, work, in, one, unit, of, time, otherwise, all, electrical, calculations, will, require, conversion, factors, since, so, called, absolute, units, of, charge, and, current, are, expressed, as, combinations, of, units, of, mass, length, and, time, dimensional, analysis, of, the, relations, between, potential, current, and, resistance, show, that, resistance, is, expressed, in, units, of, length, per, time, a, velocity, some, early, definitions, of, a, unit, of, resistance, for, example, defined, a, unit, resistance, as, one, quadrant, of, the, earth, per, second, the, absolute, unit, system, related, magnetic, and, electrostatic, quantities, to, metric, base, units, of, mass, time, and, length, these, units, had, the, great, advantage, of, simplifying, the, equations, used, in, the, solution, of, electromagnetic, problems, and, eliminated, conversion, factors, in, calculations, about, electrical, quantities, however, the, centimeter, gram, second, cgs, units, turned, out, to, have, impractical, sizes, for, practical, measurements, various, artifact, standards, were, proposed, as, the, definition, of, the, unit, of, resistance, in, 1860, werner, siemens, 1816, 1892, published, a, suggestion, for, a, reproducible, resistance, standard, in, poggendorff, s, annalen, der, physik, und, chemie, he, proposed, a, column, of, pure, mercury, of, one, square, millimeter, cross, section, one, meter, long, siemens, mercury, unit, however, this, unit, was, not, coherent, with, other, units, one, proposal, was, to, devise, a, unit, based, on, a, mercury, column, that, would, be, coherent, in, effect, adjusting, the, length, to, make, the, resistance, one, ohm, not, all, users, of, units, had, the, resources, to, carry, out, metrology, experiments, to, the, required, precision, so, working, standards, notionally, based, on, the, physical, definition, were, required, in, 1861, latimer, clark, 1822, 1898, and, sir, charles, bright, 1832, 1888, presented, a, paper, at, the, british, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, meeting, suggesting, that, standards, for, electrical, units, be, established, and, suggesting, names, for, these, units, derived, from, eminent, philosophers, ohma, farad, and, volt, the, baas, in, 1861, appointed, a, committee, including, maxwell, and, thomson, to, report, upon, standards, of, electrical, resistance, their, objectives, were, to, devise, a, unit, that, was, of, convenient, size, part, of, a, complete, system, for, electrical, measurements, coherent, with, the, units, for, energy, stable, reproducible, and, based, on, the, french, metrical, system, in, the, third, report, of, the, committee, 1864, the, resistance, unit, is, referred, to, as, b, a, unit, or, ohmad, by, 1867, the, unit, is, referred, to, as, simply, ohm, the, b, a, ohm, was, intended, to, be, 10, 9, cgs, units, but, owing, to, an, error, in, calculations, the, definition, was, 1, 3, too, small, the, error, was, significant, for, preparation, of, working, standards, on, 21, september, 1881, the, international, electrical, congress, defined, a, practical, unit, of, ohm, for, the, resistance, based, on, cgs, units, using, a, mercury, column, 1, mm, 2, in, cross, section, approximately, 104, 9, cm, in, length, at, 0, c, similar, to, the, apparatus, suggested, by, siemens, a, legal, ohm, a, reproducible, standard, was, defined, by, the, international, conference, of, electricians, at, paris, in, 1884, as, the, resistance, of, a, mercury, column, of, specified, weight, and, 106, cm, long, this, was, a, compromise, value, between, the, b, a, unit, equivalent, to, 104, 7, cm, the, siemens, unit, 100, cm, by, definition, and, the, cgs, unit, although, called, legal, this, standard, was, not, adopted, by, any, national, legislation, the, international, ohm, was, recommended, by, unanimous, resolution, at, the, international, electrical, congress, 1893, in, chicago, the, unit, was, based, upon, the, ohm, equal, to, 10, 9, units, of, resistance, of, the, c, g, s, system, of, electromagnetic, units, the, international, ohm, is, represented, by, the, resistance, offered, to, an, unvarying, electric, current, in, a, mercury, column, of, constant, cross, sectional, area, 106, 3, cm, long, of, mass, 14, 4521, grams, and, 0, c, this, definition, became, the, basis, for, the, legal, definition, of, the, ohm, in, several, countries, in, 1908, this, definition, was, adopted, by, scientific, representatives, from, several, countries, at, the, international, conference, on, electric, units, and, standards, in, london, the, mercury, column, standard, was, maintained, until, the, 1948, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, at, which, the, ohm, was, redefined, in, absolute, terms, instead, of, as, an, artifact, standard, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, units, were, well, understood, and, consistent, definitions, would, change, with, little, effect, on, commercial, uses, of, the, units, advances, in, metrology, allowed, definitions, to, be, formulated, with, a, high, degree, of, precision, and, repeatability, the, mercury, column, method, of, realizing, a, physical, standard, ohm, turned, out, to, be, difficult, to, reproduce, owing, to, the, effects, of, non, constant, cross, section, of, the, glass, tubing, various, resistance, coils, were, constructed, by, the, british, association, and, others, to, serve, as, physical, artifact, standards, for, the, unit, of, resistance, the, long, term, stability, and, reproducibility, of, these, artifacts, was, an, ongoing, field, of, research, as, the, effects, of, temperature, air, pressure, humidity, and, time, on, the, standards, were, detected, and, analyzed, artifact, standards, are, still, used, but, metrology, experiments, relating, accurately, dimensioned, inductors, and, capacitors, provided, a, more, fundamental, basis, for, the, definition, of, the, ohm, since, 1990, the, quantum, hall, effect, has, been, used, to, define, the, ohm, with, high, precision, and, repeatability, the, quantum, hall, experiments, are, used, to, check, the, stability, of, working, standards, that, have, convenient, values, for, comparison, following, the, 2019, revision, of, the, si, in, which, the, ampere, and, the, kilogram, were, redefined, in, terms, of, fundamental, constants, the, ohm, is, now, also, defined, in, terms, of, these, constants, the, symbol, was, suggested, because, of, the, similar, sound, of, ohm, and, omega, by, william, henry, preece, in, 1867, in, documents, printed, before, second, world, war, the, unit, symbol, often, consisted, of, the, raised, lowercase, omega, such, that, 56, was, written, as, 56, historically, some, document, editing, software, applications, have, used, the, symbol, typeface, to, render, the, character, where, the, font, is, not, supported, the, same, document, may, be, displayed, with, a, w, 10, w, instead, of, 10, for, instance, as, w, represents, the, watt, the, si, unit, of, power, this, can, lead, to, confusion, making, the, use, of, the, correct, unicode, code, point, preferable, where, the, character, set, is, limited, to, ascii, the, ieee, 260, 1, standard, recommends, using, the, unit, name, ohm, as, a, symbol, instead, of, in, the, electronics, industry, it, is, common, to, use, the, character, r, instead, of, the, symbol, thus, a, 10, resistor, may, be, represented, as, 10r, this, is, part, of, the, rkm, code, it, is, used, in, many, instances, where, the, value, has, a, decimal, place, for, example, 5, 6, is, listed, as, 5r6, or, 2200, is, listed, as, 2k2, this, method, avoids, overlooking, the, decimal, point, which, may, not, be, rendered, reliably, on, components, or, when, duplicating, documents, unicode, encodes, the, symbol, as, u, 2126, ohm, sign, distinct, from, greek, omega, among, letterlike, symbols, but, it, is, only, included, for, backward, compatibility, and, the, greek, uppercase, omega, character, u, 03a9, greek, capital, letter, omega, ohm, omega, is, preferred, in, ms, dos, and, microsoft, windows, the, alt, code, alt, 234, may, produce, the, symbol, in, mac, os, opt, z, does, the, same
