atomic, physics, is, the, field, of, physics, that, studies, atoms, as, an, isolated, system, of, electrons, and, an, atomic, nucleus, atomic, physics, typically, refers, to, the, study, of, atomic, structure, and, the, interaction, between, atoms, it, is, primarily, concerned, with, the, way, in, which, electrons, are, arranged, around, the, nucleus, and, the, processes, by, which, these, arrangements, change, this, comprises, ions, neutral, atoms, and, unless, otherwise, stated, it, can, be, assumed, that, the, term, atom, includes, ions, the, term, atomic, physics, can, be, associated, with, nuclear, power, and, nuclear, weapons, due, to, the, synonymous, use, of, atomic, and, nuclear, in, standard, english, physicists, distinguish, between, atomic, physics, which, deals, with, the, atom, as, a, system, consisting, of, a, nucleus, and, electrons, and, nuclear, physics, which, studies, nuclear, reactions, and, special, properties, of, atomic, nuclei, as, with, many, scientific, fields, strict, delineation, can, be, highly, contrived, and, atomic, physics, is, often, considered, in, the, wider, context, of, atomic, molecular, and, optical, physics, physics, research, groups, are, usually, so, classified, atomic, physics, primarily, considers, atoms, in, isolation, atomic, models, will, consist, of, a, single, nucleus, that, may, be, surrounded, by, one, or, more, bound, electrons, it, is, not, concerned, with, the, formation, of, molecules, although, much, of, the, physics, is, identical, nor, does, it, examine, atoms, in, a, solid, state, as, condensed, matter, it, is, concerned, with, processes, such, as, ionization, and, excitation, by, photons, or, collisions, with, atomic, particles, while, modelling, atoms, in, isolation, may, not, seem, realistic, if, one, considers, atoms, in, a, gas, or, plasma, then, the, time, scales, for, atom, atom, interactions, are, huge, in, comparison, to, the, atomic, processes, that, are, generally, considered, this, means, that, the, individual, atoms, can, be, treated, as, if, each, were, in, isolation, as, the, vast, majority, of, the, time, they, are, by, this, consideration, atomic, physics, provides, the, underlying, theory, in, plasma, physics, and, atmospheric, physics, even, though, both, deal, with, very, large, numbers, of, atoms, electrons, form, notional, shells, around, the, nucleus, these, are, normally, in, a, ground, state, but, can, be, excited, by, the, absorption, of, energy, from, light, photons, magnetic, fields, or, interaction, with, a, colliding, particle, typically, ions, or, other, electrons, electrons, that, populate, a, shell, are, said, to, be, in, a, bound, state, the, energy, necessary, to, remove, an, electron, from, its, shell, taking, it, to, infinity, is, called, the, binding, energy, any, quantity, of, energy, absorbed, by, the, electron, in, excess, of, this, amount, is, converted, to, kinetic, energy, according, to, the, conservation, of, energy, the, atom, is, said, to, have, undergone, the, process, of, ionization, if, the, electron, absorbs, a, quantity, of, energy, less, than, the, binding, energy, it, will, be, transferred, to, an, excited, state, after, a, certain, time, the, electron, in, an, excited, state, will, jump, undergo, a, transition, to, a, lower, state, in, a, neutral, atom, the, system, will, emit, a, photon, of, the, difference, in, energy, since, energy, is, conserved, if, an, inner, electron, has, absorbed, more, than, the, binding, energy, so, that, the, atom, ionizes, then, a, more, outer, electron, may, undergo, a, transition, to, fill, the, inner, orbital, in, this, case, a, visible, photon, or, a, characteristic, x, ray, is, emitted, or, a, phenomenon, known, as, the, auger, effect, may, take, place, where, the, released, energy, is, transferred, to, another, bound, electron, causing, it, to, go, into, the, continuum, the, auger, effect, allows, one, to, multiply, ionize, an, atom, with, a, single, photon, there, are, rather, strict, selection, rules, as, to, the, electronic, configurations, that, can, be, reached, by, excitation, by, light, however, there, are, no, such, rules, for, excitation, by, collision, processes, one, of, the, earliest, steps, towards, atomic, physics, was, the, recognition, that, matter, was, composed, of, atoms, it, forms, a, part, of, the, texts, written, in, 6th, century, bc, to, 2nd, century, bc, such, as, those, of, democritus, or, vai, e, ika, s, tra, written, by, ka, da, this, theory, was, later, developed, in, the, modern, sense, of, the, basic, unit, of, a, chemical, element, by, the, british, chemist, and, physicist, john, dalton, in, the, 18th, century, at, this, stage, it, wasn, t, clear, what, atoms, were, although, they, could, be, described, and, classified, by, their, properties, in, bulk, the, invention, of, the, periodic, system, of, elements, by, dmitri, mendeleev, was, another, great, step, forward, the, true, beginning, of, atomic, physics, is, marked, by, the, discovery, of, spectral, lines, and, attempts, to, describe, the, phenomenon, most, notably, by, joseph, von, fraunhofer, the, study, of, these, lines, led, to, the, bohr, atom, model, and, to, the, birth, of, quantum, mechanics, in, seeking, to, explain, atomic, spectra, an, entirely, new, mathematical, model, of, matter, was, revealed, as, far, as, atoms, and, their, electron, shells, were, concerned, not, only, did, this, yield, a, better, overall, description, i, e, the, atomic, orbital, model, but, it, also, provided, a, new, theoretical, basis, for, chemistry, quantum, chemistry, and, spectroscopy, since, the, second, world, war, both, theoretical, and, experimental, fields, have, advanced, at, a, rapid, pace, this, can, be, attributed, to, progress, in, computing, technology, which, has, allowed, larger, and, more, sophisticated, models, of, atomic, structure, and, associated, collision, processes, similar, technological, advances, in, accelerators, detectors, magnetic, field, generation, and, lasers, have, greatly, assisted, experimental, work
