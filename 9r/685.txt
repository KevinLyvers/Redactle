the, permian, p, r, m, i, n, pur, mee, n, is, a, geologic, period, and, stratigraphic, system, which, spans, 47, million, years, from, the, end, of, the, carboniferous, period, 298, 9, million, years, ago, mya, to, the, beginning, of, the, triassic, period, 251, 902, mya, it, is, the, last, period, of, the, paleozoic, era, the, following, triassic, period, belongs, to, the, mesozoic, era, the, concept, of, the, permian, was, introduced, in, 1841, by, geologist, sir, roderick, murchison, who, named, it, after, the, region, of, perm, in, russia, the, permian, witnessed, the, diversification, of, the, two, groups, of, amniotes, the, synapsids, and, the, sauropsids, reptiles, the, world, at, the, time, was, dominated, by, the, supercontinent, pangaea, which, had, formed, due, to, the, collision, of, euramerica, and, gondwana, during, the, carboniferous, pangaea, was, surrounded, by, the, superocean, panthalassa, the, carboniferous, rainforest, collapse, left, behind, vast, regions, of, desert, within, the, continental, interior, amniotes, which, could, better, cope, with, these, drier, conditions, rose, to, dominance, in, place, of, their, amphibian, ancestors, various, authors, recognise, at, least, three, and, possibly, four, extinction, events, in, the, permian, the, end, of, the, early, permian, cisuralian, saw, a, major, faunal, turnover, with, most, lineages, of, primitive, pelycosaur, synapsids, becoming, extinct, being, replaced, by, more, advanced, therapsids, the, end, of, the, capitanian, stage, of, the, permian, was, marked, by, the, major, capitanian, mass, extinction, event, associated, with, the, eruption, of, the, emeishan, traps, the, permian, along, with, the, paleozoic, ended, with, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, the, largest, mass, extinction, in, earth, s, history, which, is, the, last, of, the, three, or, four, crises, that, occurred, in, the, permian, in, which, nearly, 81, of, marine, species, and, 70, of, terrestrial, species, died, out, associated, with, the, eruption, of, the, siberian, traps, it, took, well, into, the, triassic, for, life, to, recover, from, this, catastrophe, on, land, ecosystems, took, 30, million, years, to, recover, prior, to, the, introduction, of, the, term, permian, rocks, of, equivalent, age, in, germany, had, been, named, the, rotliegend, and, zechstein, and, in, great, britain, as, the, new, red, sandstone, the, term, permian, was, introduced, into, geology, in, 1841, by, sir, roderick, impey, murchison, president, of, the, geological, society, of, london, after, extensive, russian, explorations, undertaken, with, douard, de, verneuil, in, the, vicinity, of, the, ural, mountains, in, the, years, 1840, and, 1841, murchison, identified, vast, series, of, beds, of, marl, schist, limestone, sandstone, and, conglomerate, that, succeeded, carboniferous, strata, in, the, region, murchison, in, collaboration, with, russian, geologists, named, the, period, after, the, surrounding, russian, region, of, perm, which, takes, its, name, from, the, medieval, kingdom, of, permia, that, occupied, the, same, area, hundreds, of, years, prior, and, which, is, now, located, in, the, perm, krai, administrative, region, between, 1853, and, 1867, jules, marcou, recognised, permian, strata, in, a, large, area, of, north, america, from, the, mississippi, river, to, the, colorado, river, and, proposed, the, name, dyassic, from, dyas, and, trias, though, murchison, rejected, this, in, 1871, the, permian, system, was, controversial, for, over, a, century, after, its, original, naming, with, the, united, states, geological, survey, until, 1941, considering, the, permian, a, subsystem, of, the, carboniferous, equivalent, to, the, mississippian, and, pennsylvanian, the, permian, period, is, divided, into, three, epochs, from, oldest, to, youngest, the, cisuralian, guadalupian, and, lopingian, geologists, divide, the, rocks, of, the, permian, into, a, stratigraphic, set, of, smaller, units, called, stages, each, formed, during, corresponding, time, intervals, called, ages, stages, can, be, defined, globally, or, regionally, for, global, stratigraphic, correlation, the, international, commission, on, stratigraphy, ics, ratify, global, stages, based, on, a, global, boundary, stratotype, section, and, point, gssp, from, a, single, formation, a, stratotype, identifying, the, lower, boundary, of, the, stage, the, ages, of, the, permian, from, youngest, to, oldest, are, for, most, of, the, 20th, century, the, permian, was, divided, into, the, early, and, late, permian, with, the, kungurian, being, the, last, stage, of, the, early, permian, glenister, and, colleagues, in, 1992, proposed, a, tripartite, scheme, advocating, that, the, roadian, capitanian, was, distinct, from, the, rest, of, the, late, permian, and, should, be, regarded, as, a, separate, epoch, the, tripartite, split, was, adopted, after, a, formal, proposal, by, glenister, et, al, 1999, historically, most, marine, biostratigraphy, of, the, permian, was, based, on, ammonoids, however, ammonoid, localities, are, rare, in, permian, stratigraphic, sections, and, species, characterise, relatively, long, periods, of, time, all, gssps, for, the, permian, are, based, around, the, first, appearance, datum, of, specific, species, of, conodont, an, enigmatic, group, of, jawless, chordates, with, hard, tooth, like, oral, elements, conodonts, are, used, as, index, fossils, for, most, of, the, palaeozoic, and, the, triassic, the, cisuralian, series, is, named, after, the, strata, exposed, on, the, western, slopes, of, the, ural, mountains, in, russia, and, kazakhstan, the, name, was, proposed, by, j, b, waterhouse, in, 1982, to, comprise, the, asselian, sakmarian, and, artinskian, stages, the, kungurian, was, later, added, to, conform, to, the, russian, lower, permian, albert, auguste, cochon, de, lapparent, in, 1900, had, proposed, the, uralian, series, but, the, subsequent, inconsistent, usage, of, this, term, meant, that, it, was, later, abandoned, the, asselian, was, named, by, the, russian, stratigrapher, v, e, ruzhenchev, in, 1954, after, the, assel, river, in, the, southern, ural, mountains, the, gssp, for, the, base, of, the, asselian, is, located, in, the, aidaralash, river, valley, near, aqt, be, kazakhstan, which, was, ratified, in, 1996, the, beginning, of, the, stage, is, defined, by, the, first, appearance, of, streptognathodus, postfusus, the, sakmarian, is, named, in, reference, to, the, sakmara, river, in, the, southern, urals, and, was, coined, by, alexander, karpinsky, in, 1874, the, gssp, for, the, base, of, the, sakmarian, is, located, at, the, usolka, section, in, the, southern, urals, which, was, ratified, in, 2018, the, gssp, is, defined, by, the, first, appearance, of, sweetognathus, binodosus, the, artinskian, was, named, after, the, city, of, arti, in, sverdlovsk, oblast, russia, it, was, named, by, karpinsky, in, 1874, the, artinskian, currently, lacks, a, defined, gssp, the, proposed, definition, for, the, base, of, the, artinskian, is, the, first, appearance, of, sweetognathus, aff, s, whitei, the, kungurian, takes, its, name, after, kungur, a, city, in, perm, krai, the, stage, was, introduced, by, alexandr, antonovich, stukenberg, in, 1890, the, kungurian, currently, lacks, a, defined, gssp, recent, proposals, have, suggested, the, appearance, of, neostreptognathodus, pnevi, as, the, lower, boundary, the, guadalupian, series, is, named, after, the, guadalupe, mountains, in, texas, and, new, mexico, where, extensive, marine, sequences, of, this, age, are, exposed, it, was, named, by, george, herbert, girty, in, 1902, the, roadian, was, named, in, 1968, in, reference, to, the, road, canyon, member, of, the, word, formation, in, texas, the, gssp, for, the, base, of, the, roadian, is, located, 42, 7m, above, the, base, of, the,

first, appearance, of, jinogondolella, postserrata, the, lopingian, was, first, introduced, by, amadeus, william, grabau, in, 1923, as, the, loping, series, after, leping, jiangxi, china, originally, used, as, a, lithostraphic, unit, t, k, huang, in, 1932, raised, the, lopingian, to, a, series, including, all, permian, deposits, in, south, china, that, overlie, the, maokou, limestone, in, 1995, a, vote, by, the, subcommission, on, permian, stratigraphy, of, the, ics, adopted, the, lopingian, as, an, international, standard, chronostratigraphic, unit, the, wuchiapinginan, and, changhsingian, were, first, introduced, in, 1962, by, j, z, sheng, as, the, wuchiaping, formation, and, changhsing, formation, within, the, lopingian, series, the, gssp, for, the, base, of, the, wuchiapingian, is,

originally, derived, from, the, changxing, limestone, a, geological, unit, first, named, by, the, grabau, in, 1923, ultimately, deriving, from, changxing, county, zhejiang, the, gssp, for, the, base, of, the, changhsingian, is, located, 88, cm, above, the, base, of, the, changxing, limestone, in, the, meishan, d, section, zhejiang, china, and, was, ratified, in, 2005, the, boundary, is, defined, by, the, first, appearance, of, clarkina, wangi, the, gssp, for, the, base, of, the, triassic, is, located, at, the, base, of, bed, 27c, at, the, meishan, d, section, and, was, ratified, in, 2001, the, gssp, is, defined, by, the, first, appearance, of, the, conodont, hindeodus, parvus, the, russian, tatarian, stage, includes, the, lopingian, capitanian, and, part, of, the, wordian, while, the, underlying, kazanian, includes, the, rest, of, the, wordian, as, well, as, the, roadian, in, north, america, the, permian, is, divided, into, the, wolfcampian, which, includes, the, nealian, and, the, lenoxian, stages, the, leonardian, hessian, and, cathedralian, stages, the, guadalupian, and, the, ochoan, corresponding, to, the, lopingian, during, the, permian, all, the, earth, s, major, landmasses, were, collected, into, a, single, supercontinent, known, as, pangaea, with, the, microcontinental, terranes, of, cathaysia, to, the, east, pangaea, straddled, the, equator, and, extended, toward, the, poles, with, a, corresponding, effect, on, ocean, currents, in, the, single, great, ocean, panthalassa, the, universal, sea, and, the, paleo, tethys, ocean, a, large, ocean, that, existed, between, asia, and, gondwana, the, cimmeria, continent, rifted, away, from, gondwana, and, drifted, north, to, laurasia, causing, the, paleo, tethys, ocean, to, shrink, a, new, ocean, was, growing, on, its, southern, end, the, neotethys, ocean, an, ocean, that, would, dominate, much, of, the, mesozoic, era, a, magmatic, arc, containing, hainan, on, its, southwesternmost, end, began, to, form, as, panthalassa, subducted, under, the, southeastern, south, china, the, central, pangean, mountains, which, began, forming, due, to, the, collision, of, laurasia, and, gondwana, during, the, carboniferous, reached, their, maximum, height, during, the, early, permian, around, 295, million, years, ago, comparable, to, the, present, himalayas, but, became, heavily, eroded, as, the, permian, progressed, the, kazakhstania, block, collided, with, baltica, during, the, cisuralian, while, the, north, china, craton, the, south, china, block, and, indochina, fused, to, each, other, and, pangea, by, the, end, of, the, permian, the, zechstein, sea, a, hypersaline, epicontinental, sea, existed, in, what, is, now, northwestern, europe, large, continental, landmass, interiors, experience, climates, with, extreme, variations, of, heat, and, cold, continental, climate, and, monsoon, conditions, with, highly, seasonal, rainfall, patterns, deserts, seem, to, have, been, widespread, on, pangaea, such, dry, conditions, favored, gymnosperms, plants, with, seeds, enclosed, in, a, protective, cover, over, plants, such, as, ferns, that, disperse, spores, in, a, wetter, environment, the, first, modern, trees, conifers, ginkgos, and, cycads, appeared, in, the, permian, three, general, areas, are, especially, noted, for, their, extensive, permian, deposits, the, ural, mountains, where, perm, itself, is, located, china, and, the, southwest, of, north, america, including, the, texas, red, beds, the, permian, basin, in, the, u, s, states, of, texas, and, new, mexico, is, so, named, because, it, has, one, of, the, thickest, deposits, of, permian, rocks, in, the, world, sea, levels, dropped, slightly, during, the, earliest, permian, asselian, the, sea, level, was, stable, at, several, tens, of, metres, above, present, during, the, early, permian, but, there, was, a, sharp, drop, beginning, during, the, roadian, culminating, in, the, lowest, sea, level, of, the, entire, palaeozoic, at, around, present, sea, level, during, the, wuchiapingian, followed, by, a, slight, rise, during, the, changhsingian, the, permian, was, cool, in, comparison, to, most, other, geologic, time, periods, with, modest, pole, to, equator, temperature, gradients, at, the, start, of, the, permian, the, earth, was, still, in, the, late, paleozoic, icehouse, lpia, which, began, in, the, latest, devonian, and, spanned, the, entire, carboniferous, period, with, its, most, intense, phase, occurring, during, the, latter, part, of, the, pennsylvanian, epoch, a, significant, trend, of, increasing, aridification, can, be, observed, over, the, course, of, the, cisuralian, early, permian, aridification, was, most, notable, in, pangaean, localities, at, near, equatorial, latitudes, sea, levels, also, rose, notably, in, the, early, permian, as, the, lpia, slowly, waned, at, the, carboniferous, permian, boundary, a, warming, event, occurred, in, addition, to, becoming, warmer, the, climate, became, notably, more, arid, at, the, end, of, the, carboniferous, and, beginning, of, the, permian, nonetheless, temperatures, continued, to, cool, during, most, of, the, asselian, and, sakmarian, during, which, the, lpia, peaked, by, 287, million, years, ago, temperatures, warmed, and, the, south, pole, ice, cap, retreated, in, what, was, known, as, the, artinskian, warming, event, awe, though, glaciers, remained, present, in, the, uplands, of, eastern, australia, and, perhaps, also, the, mountainous, regions, of, far, northern, siberia, southern, africa, also, retained, glaciers, during, the, late, cisuralian, in, upland, environments, the, awe, also, witnessed, aridification, of, a, particularly, great, magnitude, in, the, late, kungurian, cooling, resumed, resulting, in, a, cool, glacial, interval, that, lasted, into, the, early, capitanian, though, average, temperatures, were, still, much, higher, than, during, the, beginning, of, the, cisuralian, another, cool, period, began, around, the, middle, capitanian, this, cool, period, lasting, for, 3, 4, myr, was, known, as, the, kamura, event, it, was, interrupted, by, the, emeishan, thermal, excursion, in, the, late, part, of, the, capitanian, around, 260, million, years, ago, corresponding, to, the, eruption, of, the, emeishan, traps, this, interval, of, rapid, climate, change, was, responsible, for, the, capitanian, mass, extinction, event, during, the, early, wuchiapingian, following, the, emplacement, of, the, emeishan, traps, global, temperatures, declined, as, carbon, dioxide, was, weathered, out, of, the, atmosphere, by, the, large, igneous, province, s, emplaced, basalts, the, late, wuchiapingian, saw, the, finale, of, the, late, palaeozoic, ice, age, when, the, last, australian, glaciers, melted, the, end, of, the, permian, is, marked, by, a, temperature, excursion, much, larger, than, the, emeishan, thermal, excursion, at, the, permian, triassic, boundary, corresponding, to, the, eruption, of, the, siberian, traps, which, released, more, than, 5, teratonnes, of, co, 2, more, than, doubling, the, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, concentration, a, 2, 18, o, excursion, signifies, the, extreme, magnitude, of, this, climatic, shift, this, extremely, rapid, interval, of, greenhouse, gas, release, caused, the, permian, triassic, mass, extinction, as, well, as, ushering, in, an, extreme, hothouse, that, persisted, for, several, million, years, into, the, next, geologic, epoch, the, triassic, the, permian, climate, was, also, extremely, seasonal, and, characterised, by, megamonsoons, which, produced, high, aridity, and, extreme, seasonality, in, pangaea, s, interiors, precipitation, along, the, western, margins, of, the, palaeo, tethys, ocean, was, very, high, evidence, for, the, megamonsoon, includes, the, presence, of, megamonsoonal, rainforests, in, the, qiangtang, basin, of, tibet, enormous, seasonal, variation, in, sedimentation, bioturbation, and, ichnofossil, deposition, recorded, in, sedimentary, facies, in, the, sydney, basin, and, palaeoclimatic, models, of, the, earth, s, climate, based, on, the, behaviour, of, modern, weather, patterns, showing, that, such, a, megamonsoon, would, occur, given, the, continental, arrangement, of, the, permian, the, aforementioned, increasing, equatorial, aridity, was, likely, driven, by, the, development, and, intensification, of, this, pangaean, megamonsoon, permian, marine, deposits, are, rich, in, fossil, mollusks, brachiopods, and, echinoderms, brachiopods, were, highly, diverse, during, the, permian, the, extinct, order, productida, was, the, predominant, group, of, permian, brachiopods, accounting, for, up, to, about, half, of, all, permian, brachiopod, genera, brachiopods, also, served, as, important, ecosystem, engineers, in, permian, reef, complexes, amongst, ammonoids, goniatitida, were, a, major, group, during, the, early, mid, permian, but, declined, during, the, late, permian, members, of, the, order, prolecanitida, were, less, diverse, the, ceratitida, originated, from, the, family, daraelitidae, within, prolecanitida, during, the, mid, permian, and, extensively, diversified, during, the, late, permian, only, three, families, of, trilobite, are, known, from, the, permian, proetidae, brachymetopidae, and, phillipsiidae, diversity, origination, and, extinction, rates, during, the, early, permian, were, low, trilobites, underwent, a, diversification, during, the, kungurian, wordian, the, last, in, their, evolutionary, history, before, declining, during, the, late, permian, by, the, changhsingian, only, a, handful, 4, 6, genera, remained, corals, exhibited, a, decline, in, diversity, over, the, course, of, the, middle, and, late, permian, terrestrial, life, in, the, permian, included, diverse, plants, fungi, arthropods, and, various, types, of, tetrapods, the, period, saw, a, massive, desert, covering, the, interior, of, pangaea, the, warm, zone, spread, in, the, northern, hemisphere, where, extensive, dry, desert, appeared, the, rocks, formed, at, that, time, were, stained, red, by, iron, oxides, the, result, of, intense, heating, by, the, sun, of, a, surface, devoid, of, vegetation, cover, a, number, of, older, types, of, plants, and, animals, died, out, or, became, marginal, elements, the, permian, began, with, the, carboniferous, flora, still, flourishing, about, the, middle, of, the, permian, a, major, transition, in, vegetation, began, the, swamp, loving, lycopod, trees, of, the, carboniferous, such, as, lepidodendron, and, sigillaria, were, progressively, replaced, in, the, continental, interior, by, the, more, advanced, seed, ferns, and, early, conifers, as, a, result, of, the, carboniferous, rainforest, collapse, at, the, close, of, the, permian, lycopod, and, equisete, swamps, reminiscent, of, carboniferous, flora, survived, only, on, a, series, of, equatorial, islands, in, the, paleo, tethys, ocean, that, later, would, become, south, china, the, permian, saw, the, radiation, of, many, important, conifer, groups, including, the, ancestors, of, many, present, day, families, rich, forests, were, present, in, many, areas, with, a, diverse, mix, of, plant, groups, the, southern, continent, saw, extensive, seed, fern, forests, of, the, glossopteris, flora, oxygen, levels, were, probably, high, there, the, ginkgos, and, cycads, also, appeared, during, this, period, insects, which, had, first, appeared, and, become, abundant, during, the, preceding, carboniferous, experienced, a, dramatic, increase, in, diversification, during, the, early, permian, towards, the, end, of, the, permian, there, was, a, substantial, drop, in, both, origination, and, extinction, rates, the, dominant, insects, during, the, permian, period, were, early, representatives, of, paleoptera, polyneoptera, and, paraneoptera, palaeodictyopteroidea, which, had, represented, the, dominant, group, of, insects, during, the, carboniferous, declined, during, the, permian, this, is, likely, due, to, competition, by, hemiptera, due, to, their, similar, mouthparts, and, therefore, ecology, primitive, relatives, of, damselflies, and, dragonflies, meganisoptera, which, include, the, largest, flying, insects, of, all, time, also, declined, during, the, permian, holometabola, the, largest, group, of, modern, insects, also, diversified, during, this, time, the, earliest, known, beetles, appeared, at, the, beginning, of, the, permian, early, beetles, such, as, members, of, permocupedidae, were, likely, xylophagous, feeding, on, decaying, wood, several, lineages, such, as, schizophoridae, expanded, into, aquatic, habitats, by, the, late, permian, members, of, the, modern, orders, archostemata, and, adephaga, are, known, from, the, late, permian, complex, wood, boring, traces, found, in, the, late, permian, of, china, suggest, that, members, of, polyphaga, the, most, diverse, group, of, modern, beetles, were, also, present, in, the, permian, based, on, molecular, evidence, phasmatodea, likely, originated, sometime, in, the, permian, in, conjunction, with, the, spread, of, insectivory, among, tetrapods, the, terrestrial, fossil, record, of, the, permian, is, patchy, and, temporally, discontinuous, early, permian, records, are, dominated, by, equatorial, europe, and, north, america, while, those, of, the, middle, and, late, permian, are, dominated, by, temperate, karoo, supergroup, sediments, of, south, africa, and, the, ural, region, of, european, russia, early, permian, terrestrial, faunas, of, north, america, and, europe, were, dominated, by, primitive, pelycosaur, synapsids, including, the, herbivorous, edaphosaurids, and, carnivorous, sphenacodontids, diadectids, and, amphibians, early, permian, reptiles, such, as, acleistorhinids, were, mostly, small, insectivores, synapsids, the, group, that, would, later, include, mammals, thrived, and, diversified, greatly, during, the, cisuralian, permian, synapsids, included, some, large, members, such, as, dimetrodon, the, special, adaptations, of, synapsids, enabled, them, to, flourish, in, the, drier, climate, of, the, permian, and, they, grew, to, dominate, the, vertebrates, a, faunal, turnover, occurred, around, the, transition, between, the, cisuralian, and, guadalupian, with, the, decline, of, amphibians, and, the, replacement, of, pelycosaurs, a, paraphyletic, group, with, more, advanced, therapsids, although, the, decline, of, early, synapsid, clades, was, apparently, a, slow, event, that, lasted, about, 20, ma, from, the, sakmarian, to, the, end, of, the, kungurian, if, terrestrial, deposition, ended, around, the, end, of, the, cisuralian, in, north, america, and, began, in, russia, during, the, early, guadalupian, a, continuous, record, of, the, transition, is, not, preserved, uncertain, dating, has, led, to, suggestions, that, there, is, a, global, hiatus, in, the, terrestrial, fossil, record, during, the, late, kungurian, and, early, roadian, referred, to, as, olson, s, gap, that, obscures, the, nature, of, the, transition, other, proposals, have, suggested, that, the, north, american, and, russian, records, overlap, with, the, latest, terrestrial, north, american, deposition, occurring, during, the, roadian, suggesting, that, there, was, an, extinction, event, dubbed, olson, s, extinction, the, middle, permian, faunas, of, south, africa, and, russia, are, dominated, by, therapsids, most, abundantly, by, the, diverse, dinocephalia, dinocephalians, become, extinct, at, the, end, of, the, middle, permian, during, the, capitanian, mass, extinction, event, late, permian, faunas, are, dominated, by, advanced, therapsids, such, as, the, predatory, sabertoothed, gorgonopsians, and, herbivorous, beaked, dicynodonts, alongside, large, herbivorous, pareiasaur, parareptiles, the, archosauromorpha, the, group, of, reptiles, that, would, give, rise, to, the, pseudosuchians, dinosaurs, and, pterosaurs, in, the, following, triassic, first, appeared, and, diversified, during, the, late, permian, including, the, first, appearance, of, the, archosauriformes, during, the, latest, permian, cynodonts, the, group, of, therapsids, ancestral, to, modern, mammals, first, appeared, and, gained, a, worldwide, distribution, during, the, late, permian, another, group, of, therapsids, the, therocephalians, such, as, lycosuchus, arose, in, the, middle, permian, there, were, no, flying, vertebrates, though, the, extinct, lizard, like, reptile, family, weigeltisauridae, from, the, late, permian, had, extendable, wings, like, modern, gliding, lizards, and, are, the, oldest, known, gliding, vertebrates, permian, stem, amniotes, consisted, of, lepospondyli, and, batrachosaurs, according, to, some, phylogenies, according, to, others, stem, amniotes, are, represented, only, by, diadectomorphs, temnospondyls, reached, a, peak, of, diversity, in, the, cisuralian, with, a, substantial, decline, during, the, guadalupian, lopingian, following, olson, s, extinction, with, the, family, diversity, dropping, below, carboniferous, levels, embolomeres, a, group, of, aquatic, crocodile, like, limbed, vertebrates, that, are, reptilliomorphs, under, some, phylogenies, they, previously, had, their, last, records, in, the, cisuralian, are, now, known, to, have, persisted, into, the, lopingian, in, china, modern, amphibians, lissamphibians, are, suggested, to, have, originated, during, permian, descending, from, a, lineage, of, dissorophoid, temnospondyls, or, lepospondyls, the, diversity, of, fish, during, the, permian, is, relatively, low, compared, to, the, following, triassic, the, dominant, group, of, bony, fishes, during, the, permian, were, the, paleopterygii, a, paraphyletic, grouping, of, actinopterygii, that, lie, outside, of, neopterygii, the, earliest, unequivocal, members, of, neopterygii, appear, during, the, early, triassic, but, a, permian, origin, is, suspected, the, diversity, of, coelacanths, is, relatively, low, throughout, the, permian, in, comparison, to, other, marine, fishes, though, there, is, an, increase, in, diversity, during, the, terminal, permian, changhsingian, corresponding, with, the, highest, diversity, in, their, evolutionary, history, during, the, early, triassic, diversity, of, freshwater, fish, faunas, was, generally, low, and, dominated, by, lungfish, and, paleopterygians, the, last, common, ancestor, of, all, living, lungfish, is, thought, to, have, existed, during, the, early, permian, though, the, fossil, record, is, fragmentary, lungfish, appear, to, have, undergone, an, evolutionary, diversification, and, size, increase, in, freshwater, habitats, during, the, early, permian, but, subsequently, declined, during, the, middle, and, late, permian, conodonts, experienced, their, lowest, diversity, of, their, entire, evolutionary, history, during, the, permian, permian, chondrichthyan, faunas, are, poorly, known, members, of, the, chondrichthyan, clade, holocephali, which, contains, living, chimaeras, reached, their, apex, of, diversity, during, the, carboniferous, permian, the, most, famous, permian, representative, being, the, buzz, saw, shark, helicoprion, known, for, its, unusual, spiral, shaped, spiral, tooth, whorl, in, the, lower, jaw, hybodonts, a, group, of, shark, like, chondrichthyans, were, widespread, and, abundant, members, of, marine, and, freshwater, faunas, throughout, the, permian, xenacanthiformes, another, extinct, group, of, shark, like, chondrichthyans, were, common, in, freshwater, habitats, and, represented, the, apex, predators, of, freshwater, ecosystems, four, floristic, provinces, in, the, permian, are, recognised, the, angaran, euramerican, gondwanan, and, cathaysian, realms, the, carboniferous, rainforest, collapse, would, result, in, the, replacement, of, lycopsid, dominated, forests, with, tree, fern, dominated, ones, during, the, late, carboniferous, in, euramerica, and, result, in, the, differentiation, of, the, cathaysian, floras, from, those, of, euramerica, the, gondwanan, floristic, region, was, dominated, by, glossopteridales, a, group, of, woody, gymnosperm, plants, for, most, of, the, permian, extending, to, high, southern, latitudes, the, ecology, of, the, most, prominent, glossopterid, glossopteris, has, been, compared, to, that, of, bald, cypress, living, in, mires, with, waterlogged, soils, the, tree, like, calamites, distant, relatives, of, modern, horsetails, lived, in, coal, swamps, and, grew, in, bamboo, like, vertical, thickets, a, mostly, complete, specimen, of, arthropitys, from, the, early, permian, chemnitz, petrified, forest, of, germany, demonstrates, that, they, had, complex, branching, patterns, similar, to, modern, angiosperm, trees, by, the, late, permian, high, thin, forests, had, become, widespread, across, the, globe, as, evidenced, by, the, global, distribution, of, weigeltisaurids, the, oldest, likely, record, of, ginkgoales, the, group, containing, ginkgo, and, its, close, relatives, is, trichopitys, heteromorpha, from, the, earliest, permian, of, france, the, oldest, known, fossils, definitively, assignable, to, modern, cycads, are, known, from, the, late, permian, in, cathaysia, where, a, wet, tropical, frost, free, climate, prevailed, the, noeggerathiales, an, extinct, group, of, tree, fern, like, progymnosperms, were, a, common, component, of, the, flora, the, earliest, permian, 298, million, years, ago, cathyasian, wuda, tuff, flora, representing, a, coal, swamp, community, has, an, upper, canopy, consisting, of, lycopsid, tree, sigillaria, with, a, lower, canopy, consisting, of, marattialean, tree, ferns, and, noeggerathiales, early, conifers, appeared, in, the, late, carboniferous, represented, by, primitive, walchian, conifers, but, were, replaced, with, more, derived, voltzialeans, during, the, permian, permian, conifers, were, very, similar, morphologically, to, their, modern, counterparts, and, were, adapted, to, stressed, dry, or, seasonally, dry, climatic, conditions, the, increasing, aridity, especially, at, low, latitudes, facilitated, the, spread, of, conifers, and, their, increasing, prevalence, throughout, terrestrial, ecosystems, bennettitales, which, would, go, on, to, become, in, widespread, the, mesozoic, first, appeared, during, the, cisuralian, in, china, lyginopterids, which, had, declined, in, the, late, pennsylvanian, and, subsequently, have, a, patchy, fossil, record, survived, into, the, late, permian, in, cathaysia, and, equatorial, east, gondwana, the, permian, ended, with, the, most, extensive, extinction, event, recorded, in, paleontology, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, 90, to, 95, of, marine, species, became, extinct, as, well, as, 70, of, all, land, organisms, it, is, also, the, only, known, mass, extinction, of, insects, recovery, from, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, was, protracted, on, land, ecosystems, took, 30, million, years, to, recover, trilobites, which, had, thrived, since, cambrian, times, finally, became, extinct, before, the, end, of, the, permian, nautiloids, a, subclass, of, cephalopods, surprisingly, survived, this, occurrence, there, is, evidence, that, magma, in, the, form, of, flood, basalt, poured, onto, the, earth, s, surface, in, what, is, now, called, the, siberian, traps, for, thousands, of, years, contributing, to, the, environmental, stress, that, led, to, mass, extinction, the, reduced, coastal, habitat, and, highly, increased, aridity, probably, also, contributed, based, on, the, amount, of, lava, estimated, to, have, been, produced, during, this, period, the, worst, case, scenario, is, the, release, of, enough, carbon, dioxide, from, the, eruptions, to, raise, world, temperatures, five, degrees, celsius, another, hypothesis, involves, ocean, venting, of, hydrogen, sulfide, gas, portions, of, the, deep, ocean, will, periodically, lose, all, of, its, dissolved, oxygen, allowing, bacteria, that, live, without, oxygen, to, flourish, and, produce, hydrogen, sulfide, gas, if, enough, hydrogen, sulfide, accumulates, in, an, anoxic, zone, the, gas, can, rise, into, the, atmosphere, oxidizing, gases, in, the, atmosphere, would, destroy, the, toxic, gas, but, the, hydrogen, sulfide, would, soon, consume, all, of, the, atmospheric, gas, available, hydrogen, sulfide, levels, might, have, increased, dramatically, over, a, few, hundred, years, models, of, such, an, event, indicate, that, the, gas, would, destroy, ozone, in, the, upper, atmosphere, allowing, ultraviolet, radiation, to, kill, off, species, that, had, survived, the, toxic, gas, there, are, species, that, can, metabolize, hydrogen, sulfide, another, hypothesis, builds, on, the, flood, basalt, eruption, theory, an, increase, in, temperature, of, five, degrees, celsius, would, not, be, enough, to, explain, the, death, of, 95, of, life, but, such, warming, could, slowly, raise, ocean, temperatures, until, frozen, methane, reservoirs, below, the, ocean, floor, near, coastlines, melted, expelling, enough, methane, among, the, most, potent, greenhouse, gases, into, the, atmosphere, to, raise, world, temperatures, an, additional, five, degrees, celsius, the, frozen, methane, hypothesis, helps, explain, the, increase, in, carbon, 12, levels, found, midway, in, the, permian, triassic, boundary, layer, it, also, helps, explain, why, the, first, phase, of, the, layer, s, extinctions, was, land, based, the, second, was, marine, based, and, starting, right, after, the, increase, in, c, 12, levels, and, the, third, land, based, again
