tidal, locking, between, a, pair, of, co, orbiting, astronomical, bodies, occurs, when, one, of, the, objects, reaches, a, state, where, there, is, no, longer, any, net, change, in, its, rotation, rate, over, the, course, of, a, complete, orbit, in, the, case, where, a, tidally, locked, body, possesses, synchronous, rotation, the, object, takes, just, as, long, to, rotate, around, its, own, axis, as, it, does, to, revolve, around, its, partner, for, example, the, same, side, of, the, moon, always, faces, earth, although, there, is, some, variability, because, the, moon, s, orbit, is, not, perfectly, circular, usually, only, the, satellite, is, tidally, locked, to, the, larger, body, however, if, both, the, difference, in, mass, between, the, two, bodies, and, the, distance, between, them, are, relatively, small, each, may, be, tidally, locked, to, the, other, this, is, the, case, for, pluto, and, charon, as, well, as, for, eris, and, dysnomia, alternative, names, for, the, tidal, locking, process, are, gravitational, locking, captured, rotation, and, spin, orbit, locking, the, effect, arises, between, two, bodies, when, their, gravitational, interaction, slows, a, body, s, rotation, until, it, becomes, tidally, locked, over, many, millions, of, years, the, interaction, forces, changes, to, their, orbits, and, rotation, rates, as, a, result, of, energy, exchange, and, heat, dissipation, when, one, of, the, bodies, reaches, a, state, where, there, is, no, longer, any, net, change, in, its, rotation, rate, over, the, course, of, a, complete, orbit, it, is, said, to, be, tidally, locked, the, object, tends, to, stay, in, this, state, because, leaving, it, would, require, adding, energy, back, into, the, system, the, object, s, orbit, may, migrate, over, time, so, as, to, undo, the, tidal, lock, for, example, if, a, giant, planet, perturbs, the, object, there, is, ambiguity, in, the, use, of, the, terms, tidally, locked, and, tidal, locking, in, that, some, scientific, sources, use, it, to, refer, exclusively, to, 1, 1, synchronous, rotation, e, g, the, moon, while, others, include, non, synchronous, orbital, resonances, in, which, there, is, no, further, transfer, of, angular, momentum, over, the, course, of, one, orbit, e, g, mercury, in, mercury, s, case, the, planet, completes, three, rotations, for, every, two, revolutions, around, the, sun, a, 3, 2, spin, orbit, resonance, in, the, special, case, where, an, orbit, is, nearly, circular, and, the, body, s, rotation, axis, is, not, significantly, tilted, such, as, the, moon, tidal, locking, results, in, the, same, hemisphere, of, the, revolving, object, constantly, facing, its, partner, regardless, of, which, definition, of, tidal, locking, is, used, the, hemisphere, that, is, visible, changes, slightly, due, to, variations, in, the, locked, body, s, orbital, velocity, and, the, inclination, of, its, rotation, axis, over, time, consider, a, pair, of, co, orbiting, objects, a, and, b, the, change, in, rotation, rate, necessary, to, tidally, lock, body, b, to, the, larger, body, a, is, caused, by, the, torque, applied, by, a, s, gravity, on, bulges, it, has, induced, on, b, by, tidal, forces, the, gravitational, force, from, object, a, upon, b, will, vary, with, distance, being, greatest, at, the, nearest, surface, to, a, and, least, at, the, most, distant, this, creates, a, gravitational, gradient, across, object, b, that, will, distort, its, equilibrium, shape, slightly, the, body, of, object, b, will, become, elongated, along, the, axis, oriented, toward, a, and, conversely, slightly, reduced, in, dimension, in, directions, orthogonal, to, this, axis, the, elongated, distortions, are, known, as, tidal, bulges, for, the, solid, earth, these, bulges, can, reach, displacements, of, up, to, around, 0, 4, m, or, 1, ft, 4, in, when, b, is, not, yet, tidally, locked, the, bulges, travel, over, its, surface, due, to, orbital, motions, with, one, of, the, two, high, tidal, bulges, traveling, close, to, the, point, where, body, a, is, overhead, for, large, astronomical, bodies, that, are, nearly, spherical, due, to, self, gravitation, the, tidal, distortion, produces, a, slightly, prolate, spheroid, i, e, an, axially, symmetric, ellipsoid, that, is, elongated, along, its, major, axis, smaller, bodies, also, experience, distortion, but, this, distortion, is, less, regular, the, material, of, b, exerts, resistance, to, this, periodic, reshaping, caused, by, the, tidal, force, in, effect, some, time, is, required, to, reshape, b, to, the, gravitational, equilibrium, shape, by, which, time, the, forming, bulges, have, already, been, carried, some, distance, away, from, the, a, b, axis, by, b, s, rotation, seen, from, a, vantage, point, in, space, the, points, of, maximum, bulge, extension, are, displaced, from, the, axis, oriented, toward, a, if, b, s, rotation, period, is, shorter, than, its, orbital, period, the, bulges, are, carried, forward, of, the, axis, oriented, toward, a, in, the, direction, of, rotation, whereas, if, b, s, rotation, period, is, longer, the, bulges, instead, lag, behind, because, the, bulges, are, now, displaced, from, the, a, b, axis, a, s, gravitational, pull, on, the, mass, in, them, exerts, a, torque, on, b, the, torque, on, the, a, facing, bulge, acts, to, bring, b, s, rotation, in, line, with, its, orbital, period, whereas, the, back, bulge, which, faces, away, from, a, acts, in, the, opposite, sense, however, the, bulge, on, the, a, facing, side, is, closer, to, a, than, the, back, bulge, by, a, distance, of, approximately, b, s, diameter, and, so, experiences, a, slightly, stronger, gravitational, force, and, torque, the, net, resulting, torque, from, both, bulges, then, is, always, in, the, direction, that, acts, to, synchronize, b, s, rotation, with, its, orbital, period, leading, eventually, to, tidal, locking, the, angular, momentum, of, the, whole, a, b, system, is, conserved, in, this, process, so, that, when, b, slows, down, and, loses, rotational, angular, momentum, its, orbital, angular, momentum, is, boosted, by, a, similar, amount, there, are, also, some, smaller, effects, on, a, s, rotation, this, results, in, a, raising, of, b, s, orbit, about, a, in, tandem, with, its, rotational, slowdown, for, the, other, case, where, b, starts, off, rotating, too, slowly, tidal, locking, both, speeds, up, its, rotation, and, lowers, its, orbit, the, tidal, locking, effect, is, also, experienced, by, the, larger, body, a, but, at, a, slower, rate, because, b, s, gravitational, effect, is, weaker, due, to, b, s, smaller, mass, for, example, earth, s, rotation, is, gradually, being, slowed, by, the, moon, by, an, amount, that, becomes, noticeable, over, geological, time, as, revealed, in, the, fossil, record, current, estimations, are, that, this, together, with, the, tidal, influence, of, the, sun, has, helped, lengthen, the, earth, day, from, about, 6, hours, to, the, current, 24, hours, over, about, 4, 5, billion, years, currently, atomic, clocks, show, that, earth, s, day, lengthens, on, average, by, about, 2, 3, milliseconds, per, century, given, enough, time, this, would, create, a, mutual, tidal, locking, between, earth, and, the, moon, the, length, of, earth, s, day, would, increase, and, the, length, of, a, lunar, month, would, also, increase, earth, s, sidereal, day, would, eventually, have, the, same, length, as, the, moon, s, orbital, period, about, 47, times, the, length, of, the, earth, day, at, present, however, earth, is, not, expected, to, become, tidally, locked, to, the, moon, before, the, sun, becomes, a, red, giant, and, engulfs, earth, and, the, moon, for, bodies, of, similar, size, the, effect, may, be, of, comparable, size, for, both, and, both, may, become, tidally, locked, to, each, other, on, a, much, shorter, timescale, an, example, is, the, dwarf, planet, pluto, and, its, satellite, charon, they, have, already, reached, a, state, where, charon, is, visible, from, only, one, hemisphere, of, pluto, and, vice, versa, a, widely, spread, misapprehension, is, that, a, tidally, locked, body, permanently, turns, one, side, to, its, host, for, orbits, that, do, not, have, an, eccentricity, close, to, zero, the, rotation, rate, tends, to, become, locked, with, the, orbital, speed, when, the, body, is, at, periapsis, which, is, the, point, of, strongest, tidal, interaction, between, the, two, objects, if, the, orbiting, object, has, a, companion, this, third, body, can, cause, the, rotation, rate, of, the, parent, object, to, vary, in, an, oscillatory, manner, this, interaction, can, also, drive, an, increase, in, orbital, eccentricity, of, the, orbiting, object, around, the, primary, an, effect, known, as, eccentricity, pumping, in, some, cases, where, the, orbit, is, eccentric, and, the, tidal, effect, is, relatively, weak, the, smaller, body, may, end, up, in, a, so, called, spin, orbit, resonance, rather, than, being, tidally, locked, here, the, ratio, of, the, rotation, period, of, a, body, to, its, own, orbital, period, is, some, simple, fraction, different, from, 1, 1, a, well, known, case, is, the, rotation, of, mercury, which, is, locked, to, its, own, orbit, around, the, sun, in, a, 3, 2, resonance, this, results, in, the, rotation, speed, roughly, matching, the, orbital, speed, around, perihelion, many, exoplanets, especially, the, close, in, ones, are, expected, to, be, in, spin, orbit, resonances, higher, than, 1, 1, a, mercury, like, terrestrial, planet, can, for, example, become, captured, in, a, 3, 2, 2, 1, or, 5, 2, spin, orbit, resonance, with, the, probability, of, each, being, dependent, on, the, orbital, eccentricity, all, twenty, known, moons, in, the, solar, system, that, are, large, enough, to, be, round, are, tidally, locked, with, their, primaries, because, they, orbit, very, closely, and, tidal, force, increases, rapidly, as, a, cubic, function, with, decreasing, distance, on, the, other, hand, most, of, the, irregular, outer, satellites, of, the, giant, planets, e, g, phoebe, which, orbit, much, farther, away, than, the, large, well, known, moons, are, not, tidally, locked, pluto, and, charon, are, an, extreme, example, of, a, tidal, lock, charon, is, a, relatively, large, moon, in, comparison, to, its, primary, and, also, has, a, very, close, orbit, this, results, in, pluto, and, charon, being, mutually, tidally, locked, pluto, s, other, moons, are, not, tidally, locked, styx, nix, kerberos, and, hydra, all, rotate, chaotically, due, to, the, influence, of, charon, similarly, eris, and, dysnomia, are, mutually, tidally, locked, orcus, and, vanth, might, also, be, mutually, tidally, locked, but, the, data, is, not, conclusive, the, tidal, locking, situation, for, asteroid, moons, is, largely, unknown, but, closely, orbiting, binaries, are, expected, to, be, tidally, locked, as, well, as, contact, binaries, earth, s, moon, s, rotation, and, orbital, periods, are, tidally, locked, with, each, other, so, no, matter, when, the, moon, is, observed, from, earth, the, same, hemisphere, of, the, moon, is, always, seen, most, of, the, far, side, of, the, moon, was, not, seen, until, 1959, when, photographs, of, most, of, the, far, side, were, transmitted, from, the, soviet, spacecraft, luna, 3, when, earth, is, observed, from, the, moon, earth, does, not, appear, to, move, across, the, sky, it, remains, in, the, same, place, while, showing, nearly, all, its, surface, as, it, rotates, on, its, axis, despite, the, moon, s, rotational, and, orbital, periods, being, exactly, locked, about, 59, percent, of, the, moon, s, total, surface, may, be, seen, with, repeated, observations, from, earth, due, to, the, phenomena, of, libration, and, parallax, librations, are, primarily, caused, by, the, moon, s, varying, orbital, speed, due, to, the, eccentricity, of, its, orbit, this, allows, up, to, about, 6, more, along, its, perimeter, to, be, seen, from, earth, parallax, is, a, geometric, effect, at, the, surface, of, earth, observers, are, offset, from, the, line, through, the, centers, of, earth, and, moon, this, accounts, for, about, a, 1, difference, in, the, moon, s, surface, which, can, be, seen, around, the, sides, of, the, moon, when, comparing, observations, made, during, moonrise, and, moonset, it, was, thought, for, some, time, that, mercury, was, in, synchronous, rotation, with, the, sun, this, was, because, whenever, mercury, was, best, placed, for, observation, the, same, side, faced, inward, radar, observations, in, 1965, demonstrated, instead, that, mercury, has, a, 3, 2, spin, orbit, resonance, rotating, three, times, for, every, two, revolutions, around, the, sun, which, results, in, the, same, positioning, at, those, observation, points, modeling, has, demonstrated, that, mercury, was, captured, into, the, 3, 2, spin, orbit, state, very, early, in, its, history, probably, within, 10, 20, million, years, after, its, formation, the, 583, 92, day, interval, between, successive, close, approaches, of, venus, to, earth, is, equal, to, 5, 001444, venusian, solar, days, making, approximately, the, same, face, visible, from, earth, at, each, close, approach, whether, this, relationship, arose, by, chance, or, is, the, result, of, some, kind, of, tidal, locking, with, earth, is, unknown, the, exoplanet, proxima, centauri, b, discovered, in, 2016, which, orbits, around, proxima, centauri, is, almost, certainly, tidally, locked, expressing, either, synchronized, rotation, or, a, 3, 2, spin, orbit, resonance, like, that, of, mercury, one, form, of, hypothetical, tidally, locked, exoplanets, are, eyeball, planets, which, in, turn, are, divided, into, hot, and, cold, eyeball, planets, close, binary, stars, throughout, the, universe, are, expected, to, be, tidally, locked, with, each, other, and, extrasolar, planets, that, have, been, found, to, orbit, their, primaries, extremely, closely, are, also, thought, to, be, tidally, locked, to, them, an, unusual, example, confirmed, by, most, may, be, tau, bo, tis, a, star, that, is, probably, tidally, locked, by, its, planet, tau, bo, tis, b, if, so, the, tidal, locking, is, almost, certainly, mutual, an, estimate, of, the, time, for, a, body, to, become, tidally, locked, can, be, obtained, using, the, following, formula, where, q, displaystyle, q, and, k, 2, displaystyle, k, 2, are, generally, very, poorly, known, except, for, the, moon, which, has, k, 2, q, 0, 0011, displaystyle, k, 2, q, 0, 0011, for, a, really, rough, estimate, it, is, common, to, take, q, 100, displaystyle, q, approx, 100, perhaps, conservatively, giving, overestimated, locking, times, and, where, even, knowing, the, size, and, density, of, the, satellite, leaves, many, parameters, that, must, be, estimated, especially, q, and, so, that, any, calculated, locking, times, obtained, are, expected, to, be, inaccurate, even, to, factors, of, ten, further, during, the, tidal, locking, phase, the, semi, major, axis, a, displaystyle, a, may, have, been, significantly, different, from, that, observed, nowadays, due, to, subsequent, tidal, acceleration, and, the, locking, time, is, extremely, sensitive, to, this, value, because, the, uncertainty, is, so, high, the, above, formulas, can, be, simplified, to, give, a, somewhat, less, cumbersome, one, by, assuming, that, the, satellite, is, spherical, k, 2, 1, q, 100, displaystyle, k, 2, ll, 1, q, 100, and, it, is, sensible, to, guess, one, revolution, every, 12, hours, in, the, initial, non, locked, state, most, asteroids, have, rotational, periods, between, about, 2, hours, and, about, 2, days, with, masses, in, kilograms, distances, in, meters, and, displaystyle, mu, in, newtons, per, meter, squared, displaystyle, mu, can, be, roughly, taken, as, 3, 10, 10, n, m, 2, for, rocky, objects, and, 4, 10, 9, n, m, 2, for, icy, ones, there, is, an, extremely, strong, dependence, on, semi, major, axis, a, displaystyle, a, for, the, locking, of, a, primary, body, to, its, satellite, as, in, the, case, of, pluto, the, satellite, and, primary, body, parameters, can, be, swapped, one, conclusion, is, that, other, things, being, equal, such, as, q, displaystyle, q, and, displaystyle, mu, a, large, moon, will, lock, faster, than, a, smaller, moon, at, the, same, orbital, distance, from, the, planet, because, m, s, displaystyle, m, s, grows, as, the, cube, of, the, satellite, radius, r, displaystyle, r, a, possible, example, of, this, is, in, the, saturn, system, where, hyperion, is, not, tidally, locked, whereas, the, larger, iapetus, which, orbits, at, a, greater, distance, is, however, this, is, not, clear, cut, because, hyperion, also, experiences, strong, driving, from, the, nearby, titan, which, forces, its, rotation, to, be, chaotic, the, above, formulae, for, the, timescale, of, locking, may, be, off, by, orders, of, magnitude, because, they, ignore, the, frequency, dependence, of, k, 2, q, displaystyle, k, 2, q, more, importantly, they, may, be, inapplicable, to, viscous, binaries, double, stars, or, double, asteroids, that, are, rubble, because, the, spin, orbit, dynamics, of, such, bodies, is, defined, mainly, by, their, viscosity, not, rigidity, all, the, bodies, below, are, tidally, locked, and, all, but, mercury, are, moreover, in, synchronous, rotation, mercury, is, tidally, locked, but, not, in, synchronous, rotation, based, on, comparison, between, the, likely, time, needed, to, lock, a, body, to, its, primary, and, the, time, it, has, been, in, its, present, orbit, comparable, with, the, age, of, the, solar, system, for, most, planetary, moons, a, number, of, moons, are, thought, to, be, locked, however, their, rotations, are, not, known, or, not, known, enough, these, are
