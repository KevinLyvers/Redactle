carbon, dioxide, is, a, chemical, compound, with, the, chemical, formula, co, 2, it, is, made, up, of, molecules, that, each, have, one, carbon, atom, covalently, double, bonded, to, two, oxygen, atoms, it, is, found, in, the, gas, state, at, room, temperature, and, as, the, source, of, available, carbon, in, the, carbon, cycle, atmospheric, co, 2, is, the, primary, carbon, source, for, life, on, earth, in, the, air, carbon, dioxide, is, transparent, to, visible, light, but, absorbs, infrared, radiation, acting, as, a, greenhouse, gas, carbon, dioxide, is, soluble, in, water, and, is, found, in, groundwater, lakes, ice, caps, and, seawater, when, carbon, dioxide, dissolves, in, water, it, forms, carbonate, and, mainly, bicarbonate, hco, 3, which, causes, ocean, acidification, as, atmospheric, co, 2, levels, increase, it, is, a, trace, gas, in, earth, s, atmosphere, at, 421, parts, per, million, ppm, or, about, 0, 04, as, of, may, 2022, having, risen, from, pre, industrial, levels, of, 280, ppm, or, about, 0, 025, burning, fossil, fuels, is, the, primary, cause, of, these, increased, co, 2, concentrations, and, also, the, primary, cause, of, climate, change, its, concentration, in, earth, s, pre, industrial, atmosphere, since, late, in, the, precambrian, was, regulated, by, organisms, and, geological, phenomena, plants, algae, and, cyanobacteria, use, energy, from, sunlight, to, synthesize, carbohydrates, from, carbon, dioxide, and, water, in, a, process, called, photosynthesis, which, produces, oxygen, as, a, waste, product, in, turn, oxygen, is, consumed, and, co, 2, is, released, as, waste, by, all, aerobic, organisms, when, they, metabolize, organic, compounds, to, produce, energy, by, respiration, co, 2, is, released, from, organic, materials, when, they, decay, or, combust, such, as, in, forest, fires, carbon, dioxide, is, 53, more, dense, than, dry, air, but, is, long, lived, and, thoroughly, mixes, in, the, atmosphere, about, half, of, excess, co, 2, emissions, to, the, atmosphere, are, absorbed, by, land, and, ocean, carbon, sinks, these, sinks, can, become, saturated, and, are, volatile, as, decay, and, wildfires, result, in, the, co, 2, being, released, back, into, the, atmosphere, co, 2, is, eventually, sequestered, stored, for, the, long, term, in, rocks, and, organic, deposits, like, coal, petroleum, and, natural, gas, sequestered, co, 2, is, released, into, the, atmosphere, through, burning, fossil, fuels, or, naturally, by, volcanoes, hot, springs, geysers, and, when, carbonate, rocks, dissolve, in, water, or, react, with, acids, co, 2, is, a, versatile, industrial, material, used, for, example, as, an, inert, gas, in, welding, and, fire, extinguishers, as, a, pressurizing, gas, in, air, guns, and, oil, recovery, and, as, a, supercritical, fluid, solvent, in, decaffeination, and, supercritical, drying, it, is, a, byproduct, of, fermentation, of, sugars, in, bread, beer, and, wine, making, and, is, added, to, carbonated, beverages, like, seltzer, and, beer, for, effervescence, it, has, a, sharp, and, acidic, odor, and, generates, the, taste, of, soda, water, in, the, mouth, but, at, normally, encountered, concentrations, it, is, odorless, carbon, dioxide, cannot, be, liquefied, at, atmospheric, pressure, low, temperature, carbon, dioxide, is, commercially, used, in, its, solid, form, commonly, known, as, dry, ice, the, solid, to, gas, phase, transition, occurs, at, 194, 7, kelvin, and, is, called, sublimation, the, symmetry, of, a, carbon, dioxide, molecule, is, linear, and, centrosymmetric, at, its, equilibrium, geometry, the, length, of, the, carbon, oxygen, bond, in, carbon, dioxide, is, 116, 3, pm, noticeably, shorter, than, the, roughly, 140, pm, length, of, a, typical, single, c, o, bond, and, shorter, than, most, other, c, o, multiply, bonded, functional, groups, such, as, carbonyls, since, it, is, centrosymmetric, the, molecule, has, no, electric, dipole, moment, as, a, linear, triatomic, molecule, co, 2, has, four, vibrational, modes, as, shown, in, the, diagram, in, the, symmetric, and, the, antisymmetric, stretching, modes, the, atoms, move, along, the, axis, of, the, molecule, there, are, two, bending, modes, which, are, degenerate, meaning, that, they, have, the, same, frequency, and, same, energy, because, of, the, symmetry, of, the, molecule, when, a, molecule, touches, a, surface, or, touches, another, molecule, the, two, bending, modes, can, differ, in, frequency, because, the, interaction, is, different, for, the, two, modes, some, of, the, vibrational, modes, are, observed, in, the, infrared, ir, spectrum, the, antisymmetric, stretching, mode, at, wavenumber, 2349, cm, 1, wavelength, 4, 25, m, and, the, degenerate, pair, of, bending, modes, at, 667, cm, 1, wavelength, 15, m, the, symmetric, stretching, mode, does, not, create, an, electric, dipole, so, is, not, observed, in, ir, spectroscopy, but, it, is, detected, in, raman, spectroscopy, at, 1388, cm, 1, wavelength, 7, 2, m, in, the, gas, phase, carbon, dioxide, molecules, undergo, significant, vibrational, motions, and, do, not, keep, a, fixed, structure, however, in, a, coulomb, explosion, imaging, experiment, an, instantaneous, image, of, the, molecular, structure, can, be, deduced, such, an, experiment, has, been, performed, for, carbon, dioxide, the, result, of, this, experiment, and, the, conclusion, of, theoretical, calculations, based, on, an, ab, initio, potential, energy, surface, of, the, molecule, is, that, none, of, the, molecules, in, the, gas, phase, are, ever, exactly, linear, this, counter, intuitive, result, is, trivially, due, to, the, fact, that, the, nuclear, motion, volume, element, vanishes, for, linear, geometries, this, is, so, for, all, molecules, except, diatomic, molecules, carbon, dioxide, is, soluble, in, water, in, which, it, reversibly, forms, h, 2, co, 3, carbonic, acid, which, is, a, weak, acid, because, its, ionization, in, water, is, incomplete, the, hydration, equilibrium, constant, of, carbonic, acid, is, at, 25, c, hence, the, majority, of, the, carbon, dioxide, is, not, converted, into, carbonic, acid, but, remains, as, co, 2, molecules, not, affecting, the, ph, the, relative, concentrations, of, co, 2, h, 2, co, 3, and, the, deprotonated, forms, hco, 3, bicarbonate, and, co, 2, 3, carbonate, depend, on, the, ph, as, shown, in, a, bjerrum, plot, in, neutral, or, slightly, alkaline, water, ph, 6, 5, the, bicarbonate, form, predominates, 50, becoming, the, most, prevalent, 95, at, the, ph, of, seawater, in, very, alkaline, water, ph, 10, 4, the, predominant, 50, form, is, carbonate, the, oceans, being, mildly, alkaline, with, typical, ph, 8, 2, 8, 5, contain, about, 120, mg, of, bicarbonate, per, liter, being, diprotic, carbonic, acid, has, two, acid, dissociation, constants, the, first, one, for, the, dissociation, into, the, bicarbonate, also, called, hydrogen, carbonate, ion, hco, 3, this, is, the, true, first, acid, dissociation, constant, defined, as, where, the, denominator, includes, only, covalently, bound, h, 2, co, 3, and, does, not, include, hydrated, co, 2, aq, the, much, smaller, and, often, quoted, value, near, 4, 16, 10, 7, or, pk, a1, 6, 38, is, an, apparent, value, calculated, on, the, incorrect, assumption, that, all, dissolved, co, 2, is, present, as, carbonic, acid, so, that, since, most, of, the, dissolved, co, 2, remains, as, co, 2, molecules, k, a1, apparent, has, a, much, larger, denominator, and, a, much, smaller, value, than, the, true, k, a1, the, bicarbonate, ion, is, an, amphoteric, species, that, can, act, as, an, acid, or, as, a, base, depending, on, ph, of, the, solution, at, high, ph, it, dissociates, significantly, into, the, carbonate, ion, co, 2, 3, in, organisms, carbonic, acid, production, is, catalysed, by, the, enzyme, known, as, carbonic, anhydrase, in, addition, to, altering, its, acidity, the, presence, of, carbon, dioxide, in, water, also, affects, its, electrical, properties, when, carbon, dioxide, dissolves, in, desalinated, water, the, electrical, conductivity, increases, significantly, from, below, 1, s, cm, to, nearly, 30, s, cm, when, heated, the, water, begins, to, gradually, lose, the, conductivity, induced, by, the, presence, of, c, o, 2, displaystyle, mathrm, co, 2, especially, noticeable, as, temperatures, exceed, 30, c, the, temperature, dependence, of, the, electrical, conductivity, of, fully, deionized, water, without, c, o, 2, displaystyle, mathrm, co, 2, saturation, is, comparably, low, in, relation, to, these, data, co, 2, is, a, potent, electrophile, having, an, electrophilic, reactivity, that, is, comparable, to, benzaldehyde, or, strongly, electrophilic, unsaturated, carbonyl, compounds, however, unlike, electrophiles, of, similar, reactivity, the, reactions, of, nucleophiles, with, co, 2, are, thermodynamically, less, favored, and, are, often, found, to, be, highly, reversible, the, reversible, reaction, of, carbon, dioxide, with, amines, to, make, carbamates, is, used, in, co, 2, scrubbers, and, has, been, suggested, as, a, possible, starting, point, for, carbon, capture, and, storage, by, amine, gas, treating, only, very, strong, nucleophiles, like, the, carbanions, provided, by, grignard, reagents, and, organolithium, compounds, react, with, co, 2, to, give, carboxylates, in, metal, carbon, dioxide, complexes, co, 2, serves, as, a, ligand, which, can, facilitate, the, conversion, of, co, 2, to, other, chemicals, the, reduction, of, co, 2, to, co, is, ordinarily, a, difficult, and, slow, reaction, the, redox, potential, for, this, reaction, near, ph, 7, is, about, 0, 53, v, versus, the, standard, hydrogen, electrode, the, nickel, containing, enzyme, carbon, monoxide, dehydrogenase, catalyses, this, process, photoautotrophs, i, e, plants, and, cyanobacteria, use, the, energy, contained, in, sunlight, to, photosynthesize, simple, sugars, from, co, 2, absorbed, from, the, air, and, water, carbon, dioxide, is, colorless, at, low, concentrations, the, gas, is, odorless, however, at, sufficiently, high, concentrations, it, has, a, sharp, acidic, odor, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, the, density, of, carbon, dioxide, is, around, 1, 98, kg, m, 3, about, 1, 53, times, that, of, air, carbon, dioxide, has, no, liquid, state, at, pressures, below, 0, 51795, 10, mpa, 5, 11177, 99, atm, at, a, pressure, of, 1, atm, 0, 101325, mpa, the, gas, deposits, directly, to, a, solid, at, temperatures, below, 194, 6855, 30, k, 78, 4645, 30, c, and, the, solid, sublimes, directly, to, a, gas, above, this, temperature, in, its, solid, state, carbon, dioxide, is, commonly, called, dry, ice, liquid, carbon, dioxide, forms, only, at, pressures, above, 0, 51795, 10, mpa, 5, 11177, 99, atm, the, triple, point, of, carbon, dioxide, is, 216, 592, 3, k, 56, 558, 3, c, at, 0, 51795, 10, mpa, 5, 11177, 99, atm, see, phase, diagram, the, critical, point, is, 304, 128, 15, k, 30, 978, 15, c, at, 7, 3773, 30, mpa, 72, 808, 30, atm, another, form, of, solid, carbon, dioxide, observed, at, high, pressure, is, an, amorphous, glass, like, solid, this, form, of, glass, called, carbonia, is, produced, by, supercooling, heated, co, 2, at, extreme, pressures, 40, 48, gpa, or, about, 400, 000, atmospheres, in, a, diamond, anvil, this, discovery, confirmed, the, theory, that, carbon, dioxide, could, exist, in, a, glass, state, similar, to, other, members, of, its, elemental, family, like, silicon, dioxide, silica, glass, and, germanium, dioxide, unlike, silica, and, germania, glasses, however, carbonia, glass, is, not, stable, at, normal, pressures, and, reverts, to, gas, when, pressure, is, released, at, temperatures, and, pressures, above, the, critical, point, carbon, dioxide, behaves, as, a, supercritical, fluid, known, as, supercritical, carbon, dioxide, table, of, thermal, and, physical, properties, of, saturated, liquid, carbon, dioxide, table, of, thermal, and, physical, properties, of, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, at, atmospheric, pressure, carbon, dioxide, is, an, end, product, of, cellular, respiration, in, organisms, that, obtain, energy, by, breaking, down, sugars, fats, and, amino, acids, with, oxygen, as, part, of, their, metabolism, this, includes, all, plants, algae, and, animals, and, aerobic, fungi, and, bacteria, in, vertebrates, the, carbon, dioxide, travels, in, the, blood, from, the, body, s, tissues, to, the, skin, e, g, amphibians, or, the, gills, e, g, fish, from, where, it, dissolves, in, the, water, or, to, the, lungs, from, where, it, is, exhaled, during, active, photosynthesis, plants, can, absorb, more, carbon, dioxide, from, the, atmosphere, than, they, release, in, respiration, carbon, fixation, is, a, biochemical, process, by, which, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, is, incorporated, by, plants, algae, and, cyanobacteria, into, energy, rich, organic, molecules, such, as, glucose, thus, creating, their, own, food, by, photosynthesis, photosynthesis, uses, carbon, dioxide, and, water, to, produce, sugars, from, which, other, organic, compounds, can, be, constructed, and, oxygen, is, produced, as, a, by, product, ribulose, 1, 5, bisphosphate, carboxylase, oxygenase, commonly, abbreviated, to, rubisco, is, the, enzyme, involved, in, the, first, major, step, of, carbon, fixation, the, production, of, two, molecules, of, 3, phosphoglycerate, from, co, 2, and, ribulose, bisphosphate, as, shown, in, the, diagram, at, left, rubisco, is, thought, to, be, the, single, most, abundant, protein, on, earth, phototrophs, use, the, products, of, their, photosynthesis, as, internal, food, sources, and, as, raw, material, for, the, biosynthesis, of, more, complex, organic, molecules, such, as, polysaccharides, nucleic, acids, and, proteins, these, are, used, for, their, own, growth, and, also, as, the, basis, of, the, food, chains, and, webs, that, feed, other, organisms, including, animals, such, as, ourselves, some, important, phototrophs, the, coccolithophores, synthesise, hard, calcium, carbonate, scales, a, globally, significant, species, of, coccolithophore, is, emiliania, huxleyi, whose, calcite, scales, have, formed, the, basis, of, many, sedimentary, rocks, such, as, limestone, where, what, was, previously, atmospheric, carbon, can, remain, fixed, for, geological, timescales, plants, can, grow, as, much, as, 50, faster, in, concentrations, of, 1, 000, ppm, co, 2, when, compared, with, ambient, conditions, though, this, assumes, no, change, in, climate, and, no, limitation, on, other, nutrients, elevated, co, 2, levels, cause, increased, growth, reflected, in, the, harvestable, yield, of, crops, with, wheat, rice, and, soybean, all, showing, increases, in, yield, of, 12, 14, under, elevated, co, 2, in, face, experiments, increased, atmospheric, co, 2, concentrations, result, in, fewer, stomata, developing, on, plants, which, leads, to, reduced, water, usage, and, increased, water, use, efficiency, studies, using, face, have, shown, that, co, 2, enrichment, leads, to, decreased, concentrations, of, micronutrients, in, crop, plants, this, may, have, knock, on, effects, on, other, parts, of, ecosystems, as, herbivores, will, need, to, eat, more, food, to, gain, the, same, amount, of, protein, the, concentration, of, secondary, metabolites, such, as, phenylpropanoids, and, flavonoids, can, also, be, altered, in, plants, exposed, to, high, concentrations, of, co, 2, plants, also, emit, co, 2, during, respiration, and, so, the, majority, of, plants, and, algae, which, use, c3, photosynthesis, are, only, net, absorbers, during, the, day, though, a, growing, forest, will, absorb, many, tons, of, co, 2, each, year, a, mature, forest, will, produce, as, much, co, 2, from, respiration, and, decomposition, of, dead, specimens, e, g, fallen, branches, as, is, used, in, photosynthesis, in, growing, plants, contrary, to, the, long, standing, view, that, they, are, carbon, neutral, mature, forests, can, continue, to, accumulate, carbon, and, remain, valuable, carbon, sinks, helping, to, maintain, the, carbon, balance, of, earth, s, atmosphere, additionally, and, crucially, to, life, on, earth, photosynthesis, by, phytoplankton, consumes, dissolved, co, 2, in, the, upper, ocean, and, thereby, promotes, the, absorption, of, co, 2, from, the, atmosphere, carbon, dioxide, content, in, fresh, air, averaged, between, sea, level, and, 10, kpa, level, i, e, about, 30, km, 19, mi, altitude, varies, between, 0, 036, 360, ppm, and, 0, 041, 412, ppm, depending, on, the, location, co, 2, is, an, asphyxiant, gas, and, not, classified, as, toxic, or, harmful, in, accordance, with, globally, harmonized, system, of, classification, and, labelling, of, chemicals, standards, of, united, nations, economic, commission, for, europe, by, using, the, oecd, guidelines, for, the, testing, of, chemicals, in, concentrations, up, to, 1, 10, 000, ppm, it, will, make, some, people, feel, drowsy, and, give, the, lungs, a, stuffy, feeling, concentrations, of, 7, to, 10, 70, 000, to, 100, 000, ppm, may, cause, suffocation, even, in, the, presence, of, sufficient, oxygen, manifesting, as, dizziness, headache, visual, and, hearing, dysfunction, and, unconsciousness, within, a, few, minutes, to, an, hour, the, physiological, effects, of, acute, carbon, dioxide, exposure, are, grouped, together, under, the, term, hypercapnia, a, subset, of, asphyxiation, because, it, is, heavier, than, air, in, locations, where, the, gas, seeps, from, the, ground, due, to, sub, surface, volcanic, or, geothermal, activity, in, relatively, high, concentrations, without, the, dispersing, effects, of, wind, it, can, collect, in, sheltered, pocketed, locations, below, average, ground, level, causing, animals, located, therein, to, be, suffocated, carrion, feeders, attracted, to, the, carcasses, are, then, also, killed, children, have, been, killed, in, the, same, way, near, the, city, of, goma, by, co, 2, emissions, from, the, nearby, volcano, mount, nyiragongo, the, swahili, term, for, this, phenomenon, is, mazuku, adaptation, to, increased, concentrations, of, co, 2, occurs, in, humans, including, modified, breathing, and, kidney, bicarbonate, production, in, order, to, balance, the, effects, of, blood, acidification, acidosis, several, studies, suggested, that, 2, 0, percent, inspired, concentrations, could, be, used, for, closed, air, spaces, e, g, a, submarine, since, the, adaptation, is, physiological, and, reversible, as, deterioration, in, performance, or, in, normal, physical, activity, does, not, happen, at, this, level, of, exposure, for, five, days, yet, other, studies, show, a, decrease, in, cognitive, function, even, at, much, lower, levels, also, with, ongoing, respiratory, acidosis, adaptation, or, compensatory, mechanisms, will, be, unable, to, reverse, the, condition, there, are, few, studies, of, the, health, effects, of, long, term, continuous, co, 2, exposure, on, humans, and, animals, at, levels, below, 1, occupational, co, 2, exposure, limits, have, been, set, in, the, united, states, at, 0, 5, 5000, ppm, for, an, eight, hour, period, at, this, co, 2, concentration, international, space, station, crew, experienced, headaches, lethargy, mental, slowness, emotional, irritation, and, sleep, disruption, studies, in, animals, at, 0, 5, co, 2, have, demonstrated, kidney, calcification, and, bone, loss, after, eight, weeks, of, exposure, a, study, of, humans, exposed, in, 2, 5, hour, sessions, demonstrated, significant, negative, effects, on, cognitive, abilities, at, concentrations, as, low, as, 0, 1, 1000, ppm, co, 2, likely, due, to, co, 2, induced, increases, in, cerebral, blood, flow, another, study, observed, a, decline, in, basic, activity, level, and, information, usage, at, 1000, ppm, when, compared, to, 500, ppm, however, a, review, of, the, literature, found, that, a, reliable, subset, of, studies, on, the, phenomenon, of, carbon, dioxide, induced, cognitive, impairment, to, only, show, a, small, effect, on, high, level, decision, making, for, concentrations, below, 5000, ppm, most, of, the, studies, were, confounded, by, inadequate, study, designs, environmental, comfort, uncertainties, in, exposure, doses, and, differing, cognitive, assessments, used, similarly, a, study, on, the, effects, of, the, concentration, of, co, 2, in, motorcycle, helmets, has, been, criticized, for, having, dubious, methodology, in, not, noting, the, self, reports, of, motorcycle, riders, and, taking, measurements, using, mannequins, further, when, normal, motorcycle, conditions, were, achieved, such, as, highway, or, city, speeds, or, the, visor, was, raised, the, concentration, of, co, 2, declined, to, safe, levels, 0, 2, poor, ventilation, is, one, of, the, main, causes, of, excessive, co, 2, concentrations, in, closed, spaces, leading, to, poor, indoor, air, quality, carbon, dioxide, differential, above, outdoor, concentrations, at, steady, state, conditions, when, the, occupancy, and, ventilation, system, operation, are, sufficiently, long, that, co, 2, concentration, has, stabilized, are, sometimes, used, to, estimate, ventilation, rates, per, person, higher, co, 2, concentrations, are, associated, with, occupant, health, comfort, and, performance, degradation, ashrae, standard, 62, 1, 2007, ventilation, rates, may, result, in, indoor, concentrations, up, to, 2, 100, ppm, above, ambient, outdoor, conditions, thus, if, the, outdoor, concentration, is, 400, ppm, indoor, concentrations, may, reach, 2, 500, ppm, with, ventilation, rates, that, meet, this, industry, consensus, standard, concentrations, in, poorly, ventilated, spaces, can, be, found, even, higher, than, this, range, of, 3, 000, or, 4, 000, ppm, miners, who, are, particularly, vulnerable, to, gas, exposure, due, to, insufficient, ventilation, referred, to, mixtures, of, carbon, dioxide, and, nitrogen, as, blackdamp, choke, damp, or, stythe, before, more, effective, technologies, were, developed, miners, would, frequently, monitor, for, dangerous, levels, of, blackdamp, and, other, gases, in, mine, shafts, by, bringing, a, caged, canary, with, them, as, they, worked, the, canary, is, more, sensitive, to, asphyxiant, gases, than, humans, and, as, it, became, unconscious, would, stop, singing, and, fall, off, its, perch, the, davy, lamp, could, also, detect, high, levels, of, blackdamp, which, sinks, and, collects, near, the, floor, by, burning, less, brightly, while, methane, another, suffocating, gas, and, explosion, risk, would, make, the, lamp, burn, more, brightly, in, february, 2020, three, people, died, from, suffocation, at, a, party, in, moscow, when, dry, ice, frozen, co, 2, was, added, to, a, swimming, pool, to, cool, it, down, a, similar, accident, occurred, in, 2018, when, a, woman, died, from, co, 2, fumes, emanating, from, the, large, amount, of, dry, ice, she, was, transporting, in, her, car, humans, spend, more, and, more, time, in, a, confined, atmosphere, around, 80, 90, of, the, time, in, a, building, or, vehicle, according, to, the, french, agency, for, food, environmental, and, occupational, health, safety, anses, and, various, actors, in, france, the, co, 2, rate, in, the, indoor, air, of, buildings, linked, to, human, or, animal, occupancy, and, the, presence, of, combustion, installations, weighted, by, air, renewal, is, usually, between, about, 350, and, 2, 500, ppm, in, homes, schools, nurseries, and, offices, there, are, no, systematic, relationships, between, the, levels, of, co, 2, and, other, pollutants, and, indoor, co, 2, is, statistically, not, a, good, predictor, of, pollutants, linked, to, outdoor, road, or, air, etc, traffic, co, 2, is, the, parameter, that, changes, the, fastest, with, hygrometry, and, oxygen, levels, when, humans, or, animals, are, gathered, in, a, closed, or, poorly, ventilated, room, in, poor, countries, many, open, hearths, are, sources, of, co, 2, and, co, emitted, directly, into, the, living, environment, local, concentrations, of, carbon, dioxide, can, reach, high, values, near, strong, sources, especially, those, that, are, isolated, by, surrounding, terrain, at, the, bossoleto, hot, spring, near, rapolano, terme, in, tuscany, italy, situated, in, a, bowl, shaped, depression, about, 100, m, 330, ft, in, diameter, concentrations, of, co, 2, rise, to, above, 75, overnight, sufficient, to, kill, insects, and, small, animals, after, sunrise, the, gas, is, dispersed, by, convection, high, concentrations, of, co, 2, produced, by, disturbance, of, deep, lake, water, saturated, with, co, 2, are, thought, to, have, caused, 37, fatalities, at, lake, monoun, cameroon, in, 1984, and, 1700, casualties, at, lake, nyos, cameroon, in, 1986, the, body, produces, approximately, 2, 3, pounds, 1, 0, kg, of, carbon, dioxide, per, day, per, person, containing, 0, 63, pounds, 290, g, of, carbon, in, humans, this, carbon, dioxide, is, carried, through, the, venous, system, and, is, breathed, out, through, the, lungs, resulting, in, lower, concentrations, in, the, arteries, the, carbon, dioxide, content, of, the, blood, is, often, given, as, the, partial, pressure, which, is, the, pressure, which, carbon, dioxide, would, have, had, if, it, alone, occupied, the, volume, in, humans, the, blood, carbon, dioxide, contents, are, shown, in, the, adjacent, table, co, 2, is, carried, in, blood, in, three, different, ways, exact, percentages, vary, between, arterial, and, venous, blood, hemoglobin, the, main, oxygen, carrying, molecule, in, red, blood, cells, carries, both, oxygen, and, carbon, dioxide, however, the, co, 2, bound, to, hemoglobin, does, not, bind, to, the, same, site, as, oxygen, instead, it, combines, with, the, n, terminal, groups, on, the, four, globin, chains, however, because, of, allosteric, effects, on, the, hemoglobin, molecule, the, binding, of, co, 2, decreases, the, amount, of, oxygen, that, is, bound, for, a, given, partial, pressure, of, oxygen, this, is, known, as, the, haldane, effect, and, is, important, in, the, transport, of, carbon, dioxide, from, the, tissues, to, the, lungs, conversely, a, rise, in, the, partial, pressure, of, co, 2, or, a, lower, ph, will, cause, offloading, of, oxygen, from, hemoglobin, which, is, known, as, the, bohr, effect, carbon, dioxide, is, one, of, the, mediators, of, local, autoregulation, of, blood, supply, if, its, concentration, is, high, the, capillaries, expand, to, allow, a, greater, blood, flow, to, that, tissue, bicarbonate, ions, are, crucial, for, regulating, blood, ph, a, person, s, breathing, rate, influences, the, level, of, co, 2, in, their, blood, breathing, that, is, too, slow, or, shallow, causes, respiratory, acidosis, while, breathing, that, is, too, rapid, leads, to, hyperventilation, which, can, cause, respiratory, alkalosis, although, the, body, requires, oxygen, for, metabolism, low, oxygen, levels, normally, do, not, stimulate, breathing, rather, breathing, is, stimulated, by, higher, carbon, dioxide, levels, as, a, result, breathing, low, pressure, air, or, a, gas, mixture, with, no, oxygen, at, all, such, as, pure, nitrogen, can, lead, to, loss, of, consciousness, without, ever, experiencing, air, hunger, this, is, especially, perilous, for, high, altitude, fighter, pilots, it, is, also, why, flight, attendants, instruct, passengers, in, case, of, loss, of, cabin, pressure, to, apply, the, oxygen, mask, to, themselves, first, before, helping, others, otherwise, one, risks, losing, consciousness, the, respiratory, centers, try, to, maintain, an, arterial, co, 2, pressure, of, 40, mmhg, with, intentional, hyperventilation, the, co, 2, content, of, arterial, blood, may, be, lowered, to, 10, 20, mmhg, the, oxygen, content, of, the, blood, is, little, affected, and, the, respiratory, drive, is, diminished, this, is, why, one, can, hold, one, s, breath, longer, after, hyperventilating, than, without, hyperventilating, this, carries, the, risk, that, unconsciousness, may, result, before, the, need, to, breathe, becomes, overwhelming, which, is, why, hyperventilation, is, particularly, dangerous, before, free, diving, in, earth, s, atmosphere, carbon, dioxide, is, a, trace, gas, that, plays, an, integral, part, in, the, greenhouse, effect, carbon, cycle, photosynthesis, and, oceanic, carbon, cycle, it, is, one, of, three, main, greenhouse, gases, in, the, atmosphere, of, earth, water, vapor, is, the, primary, greenhouse, gas, as, of, 2010, contributing, 50, of, the, greenhouse, effect, followed, by, carbon, dioxide, at, 20, the, current, global, average, concentration, of, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, in, the, atmosphere, is, 421, ppm, 0, 04, as, of, may, 2022, this, is, an, increase, of, 50, since, the, start, of, the, industrial, revolution, up, from, 280, ppm, during, the, 10, 000, years, prior, to, the, mid, 18th, century, the, increase, is, due, to, human, activity, as, of, march, 2024, the, monthly, average, concentration, of, co, 2, reached, a, new, record, high, of, 425, 22, parts, per, million, ppm, marking, an, increase, of, 4, 7, ppm, over, march, 2023, by, the, latest, measurement, levels, had, further, escalated, to, 427, 48, ppm, this, continuous, increase, in, co, 2, concentrations, is, a, clear, indicator, of, ongoing, global, environmental, stress, primarily, driven, by, the, burning, of, fossil, fuels, which, is, the, principal, cause, of, this, rise, and, also, a, major, contributor, to, climate, change, other, significant, human, activities, that, emit, co, 2, include, cement, production, deforestation, and, biomass, burning, carbon, dioxide, is, a, greenhouse, gas, it, absorbs, and, emits, infrared, radiation, at, its, two, infrared, active, vibrational, frequencies, the, two, wavelengths, are, 4, 26, m, 2, 347, cm, 1, asymmetric, stretching, vibrational, mode, and, 14, 99, m, 667, cm, 1, bending, vibrational, mode, co, 2, plays, a, significant, role, in, influencing, earth, s, surface, temperature, through, the, greenhouse, effect, light, emission, from, the, earth, s, surface, is, most, intense, in, the, infrared, region, between, 200, and, 2500, cm, 1, as, opposed, to, light, emission, from, the, much, hotter, sun, which, is, most, intense, in, the, visible, region, absorption, of, infrared, light, at, the, vibrational, frequencies, of, atmospheric, co, 2, traps, energy, near, the, surface, warming, the, surface, of, earth, and, its, lower, atmosphere, less, energy, reaches, the, upper, atmosphere, which, is, therefore, cooler, because, of, this, absorption, the, increase, in, atmospheric, concentrations, of, co, 2, and, other, long, lived, greenhouse, gases, such, as, methane, increase, the, absorption, and, emission, of, infrared, radiation, by, the, atmosphere, this, has, led, to, a, rise, in, average, global, temperature, and, ocean, acidification, another, direct, effect, is, the, co, 2, fertilization, effect, the, increase, in, atmospheric, concentrations, of, co, 2, causes, a, range, of, further, effects, of, climate, change, on, the, environment, and, human, living, conditions, carbon, dioxide, dissolves, in, the, ocean, to, form, carbonic, acid, h, 2, co, 3, bicarbonate, hco, 3, and, carbonate, co, 2, 3, there, is, about, fifty, times, as, much, carbon, dioxide, dissolved, in, the, oceans, as, exists, in, the, atmosphere, the, oceans, act, as, an, enormous, carbon, sink, and, have, taken, up, about, a, third, of, co, 2, emitted, by, human, activity, ocean, acidification, is, the, ongoing, decrease, in, the, ph, of, the, earth, s, ocean, between, 1950, and, 2020, the, average, ph, of, the, ocean, surface, fell, from, approximately, 8, 15, to, 8, 05, carbon, dioxide, emissions, from, human, activities, are, the, primary, cause, of, ocean, acidification, with, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, levels, exceeding, 410, ppm, in, 2020, co, 2, from, the, atmosphere, is, absorbed, by, the, oceans, this, chemical, reaction, produces, carbonic, acid, h, 2, co, 3, which, dissociates, into, a, bicarbonate, ion, hco, 3, and, a, hydrogen, ion, h, the, presence, of, free, hydrogen, ions, h, lowers, the, ph, of, the, ocean, increasing, acidity, this, does, not, mean, that, seawater, is, acidic, yet, it, is, still, alkaline, with, a, ph, higher, than, 8, marine, calcifying, organisms, such, as, mollusks, and, corals, are, especially, vulnerable, because, they, rely, on, calcium, carbonate, to, build, shells, and, skeletons, changes, in, ocean, chemistry, can, have, extensive, direct, and, indirect, effects, on, organisms, and, their, habitats, one, of, the, most, important, repercussions, of, increasing, ocean, acidity, relates, to, the, production, of, shells, out, of, calcium, carbonate, caco, 3, this, process, is, called, calcification, and, is, important, to, the, biology, and, survival, of, a, wide, range, of, marine, organisms, calcification, involves, the, precipitation, of, dissolved, ions, into, solid, caco, 3, structures, structures, for, many, marine, organisms, such, as, coccolithophores, foraminifera, crustaceans, mollusks, etc, after, they, are, formed, these, caco, 3, structures, are, vulnerable, to, dissolution, unless, the, surrounding, seawater, contains, saturating, concentrations, of, carbonate, ions, co, 2, 3, very, little, of, the, extra, carbon, dioxide, that, is, added, into, the, ocean, remains, as, dissolved, carbon, dioxide, the, majority, dissociates, into, additional, bicarbonate, and, free, hydrogen, ions, the, increase, in, hydrogen, is, larger, than, the, increase, in, bicarbonate, creating, an, imbalance, in, the, reaction, to, maintain, chemical, equilibrium, some, of, the, carbonate, ions, already, in, the, ocean, combine, with, some, of, the, hydrogen, ions, to, make, further, bicarbonate, thus, the, ocean, s, concentration, of, carbonate, ions, is, reduced, removing, an, essential, building, block, for, marine, organisms, to, build, shells, or, calcify, carbon, dioxide, is, also, introduced, into, the, oceans, through, hydrothermal, vents, the, champagne, hydrothermal, vent, found, at, the, northwest, eifuku, volcano, in, the, mariana, trench, produces, almost, pure, liquid, carbon, dioxide, one, of, only, two, known, sites, in, the, world, as, of, 2004, the, other, being, in, the, okinawa, trough, the, finding, of, a, submarine, lake, of, liquid, carbon, dioxide, in, the, okinawa, trough, was, reported, in, 2006, carbon, dioxide, is, a, by, product, of, the, fermentation, of, sugar, in, the, brewing, of, beer, whisky, and, other, alcoholic, beverages, and, in, the, production, of, bioethanol, yeast, metabolizes, sugar, to, produce, co, 2, and, ethanol, also, known, as, alcohol, as, follows, all, aerobic, organisms, produce, co, 2, when, they, oxidize, carbohydrates, fatty, acids, and, proteins, the, large, number, of, reactions, involved, are, exceedingly, complex, and, not, described, easily, refer, to, cellular, respiration, anaerobic, respiration, and, photosynthesis, the, equation, for, the, respiration, of, glucose, and, other, monosaccharides, is, anaerobic, organisms, decompose, organic, material, producing, methane, and, carbon, dioxide, together, with, traces, of, other, compounds, regardless, of, the, type, of, organic, material, the, production, of, gases, follows, well, defined, kinetic, pattern, carbon, dioxide, comprises, about, 40, 45, of, the, gas, that, emanates, from, decomposition, in, landfills, termed, landfill, gas, most, of, the, remaining, 50, 55, is, methane, carbon, dioxide, can, be, obtained, by, distillation, from, air, but, the, method, is, inefficient, industrially, carbon, dioxide, is, predominantly, an, unrecovered, waste, product, produced, by, several, methods, which, may, be, practiced, at, various, scales, the, combustion, of, all, carbon, based, fuels, such, as, methane, natural, gas, petroleum, distillates, gasoline, diesel, kerosene, propane, coal, wood, and, generic, organic, matter, produces, carbon, dioxide, and, except, in, the, case, of, pure, carbon, water, as, an, example, the, chemical, reaction, between, methane, and, oxygen, iron, is, reduced, from, its, oxides, with, coke, in, a, blast, furnace, producing, pig, iron, and, carbon, dioxide, carbon, dioxide, is, a, byproduct, of, the, industrial, production, of, hydrogen, by, steam, reforming, and, the, water, gas, shift, reaction, in, ammonia, production, these, processes, begin, with, the, reaction, of, water, and, natural, gas, mainly, methane, this, is, a, major, source, of, food, grade, carbon, dioxide, for, use, in, carbonation, of, beer, and, soft, drinks, and, is, also, used, for, stunning, animals, such, as, poultry, in, the, summer, of, 2018, a, shortage, of, carbon, dioxide, for, these, purposes, arose, in, europe, due, to, the, temporary, shut, down, of, several, ammonia, plants, for, maintenance, it, is, produced, by, thermal, decomposition, of, limestone, caco, 3, by, heating, calcining, at, about, 850, c, 1, 560, f, in, the, manufacture, of, quicklime, calcium, oxide, cao, a, compound, that, has, many, industrial, uses, acids, liberate, co, 2, from, most, metal, carbonates, consequently, it, may, be, obtained, directly, from, natural, carbon, dioxide, springs, where, it, is, produced, by, the, action, of, acidified, water, on, limestone, or, dolomite, the, reaction, between, hydrochloric, acid, and, calcium, carbonate, limestone, or, chalk, is, shown, below, the, carbonic, acid, h, 2, co, 3, then, decomposes, to, water, and, co, 2, such, reactions, are, accompanied, by, foaming, or, bubbling, or, both, as, the, gas, is, released, they, have, widespread, uses, in, industry, because, they, can, be, used, to, neutralize, waste, acid, streams, carbon, dioxide, is, used, by, the, food, industry, the, oil, industry, and, the, chemical, industry, the, compound, has, varied, commercial, uses, but, one, of, its, greatest, uses, as, a, chemical, is, in, the, production, of, carbonated, beverages, it, provides, the, sparkle, in, carbonated, beverages, such, as, soda, water, beer, and, sparkling, wine, in, the, chemical, industry, carbon, dioxide, is, mainly, consumed, as, an, ingredient, in, the, production, of, urea, with, a, smaller, fraction, being, used, to, produce, methanol, and, a, range, of, other, products, some, carboxylic, acid, derivatives, such, as, sodium, salicylate, are, prepared, using, co, 2, by, the, kolbe, schmitt, reaction, in, addition, to, conventional, processes, using, co, 2, for, chemical, production, electrochemical, methods, are, also, being, explored, at, a, research, level, in, particular, the, use, of, renewable, energy, for, production, of, fuels, from, co, 2, such, as, methanol, is, attractive, as, this, could, result, in, fuels, that, could, be, easily, transported, and, used, within, conventional, combustion, technologies, but, have, no, net, co, 2, emissions, plants, require, carbon, dioxide, to, conduct, photosynthesis, the, atmospheres, of, greenhouses, may, if, of, large, size, must, be, enriched, with, additional, co, 2, to, sustain, and, increase, the, rate, of, plant, growth, at, very, high, concentrations, 100, times, atmospheric, concentration, or, greater, carbon, dioxide, can, be, toxic, to, animal, life, so, raising, the, concentration, to, 10, 000, ppm, 1, or, higher, for, several, hours, will, eliminate, pests, such, as, whiteflies, and, spider, mites, in, a, greenhouse, some, plants, respond, more, favorably, to, rising, carbon, dioxide, concentrations, than, others, which, can, lead, to, vegetation, regime, shifts, like, woody, plant, encroachment, carbon, dioxide, is, a, food, additive, used, as, a, propellant, and, acidity, regulator, in, the, food, industry, it, is, approved, for, usage, in, the, eu, listed, as, e, number, e290, us, australia, and, new, zealand, listed, by, its, ins, number, 290, a, candy, called, pop, rocks, is, pressurized, with, carbon, dioxide, gas, at, about, 4, 000, kpa, 40, bar, 580, psi, when, placed, in, the, mouth, it, dissolves, just, like, other, hard, candy, and, releases,

the, dough, while, chemical, leaveners, such, as, baking, powder, and, baking, soda, release, carbon, dioxide, when, heated, or, if, exposed, to, acids, carbon, dioxide, is, used, to, produce, carbonated, soft, drinks, and, soda, water, traditionally, the, carbonation, of, beer, and, sparkling, wine, came, about, through, natural, fermentation, but, many, manufacturers, carbonate, these, drinks, with, carbon, dioxide, recovered, from, the, fermentation, process, in, the, case, of, bottled, and, kegged, beer, the, most, common, method, used, is, carbonation, with, recycled, carbon, dioxide, with, the, exception, of, british, real, ale, draught, beer, is, usually, transferred, from, kegs, in, a, cold, room, or, cellar, to, dispensing, taps, on, the, bar, using, pressurized, carbon, dioxide, sometimes, mixed, with, nitrogen, the, taste, of, soda, water, and, related, taste, sensations, in, other, carbonated, beverages, is, an, effect, of, the, dissolved, carbon, dioxide, rather, than, the, bursting, bubbles, of, the, gas, carbonic, anhydrase, 4, converts, carbon, dioxide, to, carbonic, acid, leading, to, a, sour, taste, and, also, the, dissolved, carbon, dioxide, induces, a, somatosensory, response, carbon, dioxide, in, the, form, of, dry, ice, is, often, used, during, the, cold, soak, phase, in, winemaking, to, cool, clusters, of, grapes, quickly, after, picking, to, help, prevent, spontaneous, fermentation, by, wild, yeast, the, main, advantage, of, using, dry, ice, over, water, ice, is, that, it, cools, the, grapes, without, adding, any, additional, water, that, might, decrease, the, sugar, concentration, in, the, grape, must, and, thus, the, alcohol, concentration, in, the, finished, wine, carbon, dioxide, is, also, used, to, create, a, hypoxic, environment, for, carbonic, maceration, the, process, used, to, produce, beaujolais, wine, carbon, dioxide, is, sometimes, used, to, top, up, wine, bottles, or, other, storage, vessels, such, as, barrels, to, prevent, oxidation, though, it, has, the, problem, that, it, can, dissolve, into, the, wine, making, a, previously, still, wine, slightly, fizzy, for, this, reason, other, gases, such, as, nitrogen, or, argon, are, preferred, for, this, process, by, professional, wine, makers, carbon, dioxide, is, often, used, to, stun, animals, before, slaughter, stunning, may, be, a, misnomer, as, the, animals, are, not, knocked, out, immediately, and, may, suffer, distress, carbon, dioxide, is, one, of, the, most, commonly, used, compressed, gases, for, pneumatic, pressurized, gas, systems, in, portable, pressure, tools, carbon, dioxide, is, also, used, as, an, atmosphere, for, welding, although, in, the, welding, arc, it, reacts, to, oxidize, most, metals, use, in, the, automotive, industry, is, common, despite, significant, evidence, that, welds, made, in, carbon, dioxide, are, more, brittle, than, those, made, in, more, inert, atmospheres, when, used, for, mig, welding, co, 2, use, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, mag, welding, for, metal, active, gas, as, co, 2, can, react, at, these, high, temperatures, it, tends, to, produce, a, hotter, puddle, than, truly, inert, atmospheres, improving, the, flow, characteristics, although, this, may, be, due, to, atmospheric, reactions, occurring, at, the, puddle, site, this, is, usually, the, opposite, of, the, desired, effect, when, welding, as, it, tends, to, embrittle, the, site, but, may, not, be, a, problem, for, general, mild, steel, welding, where, ultimate, ductility, is, not, a, major, concern, carbon, dioxide, is, used, in, many, consumer, products, that, require, pressurized, gas, because, it, is, inexpensive, and, nonflammable, and, because, it, undergoes, a, phase, transition, from, gas, to, liquid, at, room, temperature, at, an, attainable, pressure, of, approximately, 60, bar, 870, psi, 59, atm, allowing, far, more, carbon, dioxide, to, fit, in, a, given, container, than, otherwise, would, life, jackets, often, contain, canisters, of, pressured, carbon, dioxide, for, quick, inflation, aluminium, capsules, of, co, 2, are, also, sold, as, supplies, of, compressed, gas, for, air, guns, paintball, markers, guns, inflating, bicycle, tires, and, for, making, carbonated, water, high, concentrations, of, carbon, dioxide, can, also, be, used, to, kill, pests, liquid, carbon, dioxide, is, used, in, supercritical, drying, of, some, food, products, and, technological, materials, in, the, preparation, of, specimens, for, scanning, electron, microscopy, and, in, the, decaffeination, of, coffee, beans, carbon, dioxide, can, be, used, to, extinguish, flames, by, flooding, the, environment, around, the, flame, with, the, gas, it, does, not, itself, react, to, extinguish, the, flame, but, starves, the, flame, of, oxygen, by, displacing, it, some, fire, extinguishers, especially, those, designed, for, electrical, fires, contain, liquid, carbon, dioxide, under, pressure, carbon, dioxide, extinguishers, work, well, on, small, flammable, liquid, and, electrical, fires, but, not, on, ordinary, combustible, fires, because, they, do, not, cool, the, burning, substances, significantly, and, when, the, carbon, dioxide, disperses, they, can, catch, fire, upon, exposure, to, atmospheric, oxygen, they, are, mainly, used, in, server, rooms, carbon, dioxide, has, also, been, widely, used, as, an, extinguishing, agent, in, fixed, fire, protection, systems, for, local, application, of, specific, hazards, and, total, flooding, of, a, protected, space, international, maritime, organization, standards, recognize, carbon, dioxide, systems, for, fire, protection, of, ship, holds, and, engine, rooms, carbon, dioxide, based, fire, protection, systems, have, been, linked, to, several, deaths, because, it, can, cause, suffocation, in, sufficiently, high, concentrations, a, review, of, co, 2, systems, identified, 51, incidents, between, 1975, and, the, date, of, the, report, 2000, causing, 72, deaths, and, 145, injuries, liquid, carbon, dioxide, is, a, good, solvent, for, many, lipophilic, organic, compounds, and, is, used, to, decaffeinate, coffee, carbon, dioxide, has, attracted, attention, in, the, pharmaceutical, and, other, chemical, processing, industries, as, a, less, toxic, alternative, to, more, traditional, solvents, such, as, organochlorides, it, is, also, used, by, some, dry, cleaners, for, this, reason, it, is, used, in, the, preparation, of, some, aerogels, because, of, the, properties, of,

systems, using, hfcs, e, g, r134a, its, environmental, advantages, gwp, of, 1, non, ozone, depleting, non, toxic, non, flammable, could, make, it, the, future, working, fluid, to, replace, current, hfcs, in, cars, supermarkets, and, heat, pump, water, heaters, among, others, coca, cola, has, fielded, co, 2, based, beverage, coolers, and, the, u, s, army, is, interested, in, co, 2, refrigeration, and, heating, technology, carbon, dioxide, is, the, lasing, medium, in, a, carbon, dioxide, laser, which, is, one, of, the, earliest, type, of, lasers, carbon, dioxide, can, be, used, as, a, means, of, controlling, the, ph, of, swimming, pools, by, continuously, adding, gas, to, the, water, thus, keeping, the, ph, from, rising, among, the, advantages, of, this, is, the, avoidance, of, handling, more, hazardous, acids, similarly, it, is, also, used, in, the, maintaining, reef, aquaria, where, it, is, commonly, used, in, calcium, reactors, to, temporarily, lower, the, ph, of, water, being, passed, over, calcium, carbonate, in, order, to, allow, the, calcium, carbonate, to, dissolve, into, the, water, more, freely, where, it, is, used, by, some, corals, to, build, their, skeleton, used, as, the, primary, coolant, in, the, british, advanced, gas, cooled, reactor, for, nuclear, power, generation, carbon, dioxide, induction, is, commonly, used, for, the, euthanasia, of, laboratory, research, animals, methods, to, administer, co, 2, include, placing, animals, directly, into, a, closed, prefilled, chamber, containing, co, 2, or, exposure, to, a, gradually, increasing, concentration, of, co, 2, the, american, veterinary, medical, association, s, 2020, guidelines, for, carbon, dioxide, induction, state, that, a, displacement, rate, of, 30, 70, of, the, chamber, or, cage, volume, per, minute, is, optimal, for, the, humane, euthanasia, of, small, rodents, 5, 31, percentages, of, co, 2, vary, for, different, species, based, on, identified, optimal, percentages, to, minimize, distress, 22, carbon, dioxide, is, also, used, in, several, related, cleaning, and, surface, preparation, techniques, carbon, dioxide, was, the, first, gas, to, be, described, as, a, discrete, substance, in, about, 1640, the, flemish, chemist, jan, baptist, van, helmont, observed, that, when, he, burned, charcoal, in, a, closed, vessel, the, mass, of, the, resulting, ash, was, much, less, than, that, of, the, original, charcoal, his, interpretation, was, that, the, rest, of, the, charcoal, had, been, transmuted, into, an, invisible, substance, he, termed, a, gas, from, greek, chaos, or, wild, spirit, spiritus, sylvestris, the, properties, of, carbon, dioxide, were, further, studied, in, the, 1750s, by, the, scottish, physician, joseph, black, he, found, that, limestone, calcium, carbonate, could, be, heated, or, treated, with, acids, to, yield, a, gas, he, called, fixed, air, he, observed, that, the, fixed, air, was, denser, than, air, and, supported, neither, flame, nor, animal, life, black, also, found, that, when, bubbled, through, limewater, a, saturated, aqueous, solution, of, calcium, hydroxide, it, would, precipitate, calcium, carbonate, he, used, this, phenomenon, to, illustrate, that, carbon, dioxide, is, produced, by, animal, respiration, and, microbial, fermentation, in, 1772, english, chemist, joseph, priestley, published, a, paper, entitled, impregnating, water, with, fixed, air, in, which, he, described, a, process, of, dripping, sulfuric, acid, or, oil, of, vitriol, as, priestley, knew, it, on, chalk, in, order, to, produce, carbon, dioxide, and, forcing, the, gas, to, dissolve, by, agitating, a, bowl, of, water, in, contact, with, the, gas, carbon, dioxide, was, first, liquefied, at, elevated, pressures, in, 1823, by, humphry, davy, and, michael, faraday, the, earliest, description, of, solid, carbon, dioxide, dry, ice, was, given, by, the, french, inventor, adrien, jean, pierre, thilorier, who, in, 1835, opened, a, pressurized, container, of, liquid, carbon, dioxide, only, to, find, that, the, cooling, produced, by, the, rapid, evaporation, of, the, liquid, yielded, a, snow, of, solid, co, 2, carbon, dioxide, in, combination, with, nitrogen, was, known, from, earlier, times, as, blackdamp, stythe, or, choke, damp, along, with, the, other, types, of, damp, it, was, encountered, in, mining, operations, and, well, sinking, slow, oxidation, of, coal, and, biological, processes, replaced, the, oxygen, to, create, a, suffocating, mixture, of, nitrogen, and, carbon, dioxide
