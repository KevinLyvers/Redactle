in, quantum, physics, a, wave, function, or, wavefunction, is, a, mathematical, description, of, the, quantum, state, of, an, isolated, quantum, system, the, most, common, symbols, for, a, wave, function, are, the, greek, letters, and, lower, case, and, capital, psi, respectively, wave, functions, are, complex, valued, for, example, a, wave, function, might, assign, a, complex, number, to, each, point, in, a, region, of, space, the, born, rule, provides, the, means, to, turn, these, complex, probability, amplitudes, into, actual, probabilities, in, one, common, form, it, says, that, the, squared, modulus, of, a, wave, function, that, depends, upon, position, is, the, probability, density, of, measuring, a, particle, as, being, at, a, given, place, the, integral, of, a, wavefunction, s, squared, modulus, over, all, the, system, s, degrees, of, freedom, must, be, equal, to, 1, a, condition, called, normalization, since, the, wave, function, is, complex, valued, only, its, relative, phase, and, relative, magnitude, can, be, measured, its, value, does, not, in, isolation, tell, anything, about, the, magnitudes, or, directions, of, measurable, observables, one, has, to, apply, quantum, operators, whose, eigenvalues, correspond, to, sets, of, possible, results, of, measurements, to, the, wave, function, and, calculate, the, statistical, distributions, for, measurable, quantities, wave, functions, can, be, functions, of, variables, other, than, position, such, as, momentum, the, information, represented, by, a, wave, function, that, is, dependent, upon, position, can, be, converted, into, a, wave, function, dependent, upon, momentum, and, vice, versa, by, means, of, a, fourier, transform, some, particles, like, electrons, and, photons, have, nonzero, spin, and, the, wave, function, for, such, particles, includes, spin, as, an, intrinsic, discrete, degree, of, freedom, other, discrete, variables, can, also, be, included, such, as, isospin, when, a, system, has, internal, degrees, of, freedom, the, wave, function, at, each, point, in, the, continuous, degrees, of, freedom, e, g, a, point, in, space, assigns, a, complex, number, for, each, possible, value, of, the, discrete, degrees, of, freedom, e, g, z, component, of, spin, these, values, are, often, displayed, in, a, column, matrix, e, g, a, 2, 1, column, vector, for, a, non, relativistic, electron, with, spin, 1, 2, according, to, the, superposition, principle, of, quantum, mechanics, wave, functions, can, be, added, together, and, multiplied, by, complex, numbers, to, form, new, wave, functions, and, form, a, hilbert, space, the, inner, product, between, two, wave, functions, is, a, measure, of, the, overlap, between, the, corresponding, physical, states, and, is, used, in, the, foundational, probabilistic, interpretation, of, quantum, mechanics, the, born, rule, relating, transition, probabilities, to, inner, products, the, schr, dinger, equation, determines, how, wave, functions, evolve, over, time, and, a, wave, function, behaves, qualitatively, like, other, waves, such, as, water, waves, or, waves, on, a, string, because, the, schr, dinger, equation, is, mathematically, a, type, of, wave, equation, this, explains, the, name, wave, function, and, gives, rise, to, wave, particle, duality, however, the, wave, function, in, quantum, mechanics, describes, a, kind, of, physical, phenomenon, as, of, 2023, still, open, to, different, interpretations, which, fundamentally, differs, from, that, of, classic, mechanical, waves, in, 1900, max, planck, postulated, the, proportionality, between, the, frequency, f, displaystyle, f, of, a, photon, and, its, energy, e, displaystyle, e, e, h, f, displaystyle, e, hf, and, in, 1916, the, corresponding, relation, between, a, photon, s, momentum, p, displaystyle, p, and, wavelength, displaystyle, lambda, h, p, displaystyle, lambda, frac, h, p, where, h, displaystyle, h, is, the, planck, constant, in, 1923, de, broglie, was, the, first, to, suggest, that, the, relation, h, p, displaystyle, lambda, frac, h, p, now, called, the, de, broglie, relation, holds, for, massive, particles, the, chief, clue, being, lorentz, invariance, and, this, can, be, viewed, as, the, starting, point, for, the, modern, development, of, quantum, mechanics, the, equations, represent, wave, particle, duality, for, both, massless, and, massive, particles, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, quantum, mechanics, was, developed, using, calculus, and, linear, algebra, those, who, used, the, techniques, of, calculus, included, louis, de, broglie, erwin, schr, dinger, and, others, developing, wave, mechanics, those, who, applied, the, methods, of, linear, algebra, included, werner, heisenberg, max, born, and, others, developing, matrix, mechanics, schr, dinger, subsequently, showed, that, the, two, approaches, were, equivalent, in, 1926, schr, dinger, published, the, famous, wave, equation, now, named, after, him, the, schr, dinger, equation, this, equation, was, based, on, classical, conservation, of, energy, using, quantum, operators, and, the, de, broglie, relations, and, the, solutions, of, the, equation, are, the, wave, functions, for, the, quantum, system, however, no, one, was, clear, on, how, to, interpret, it, at, first, schr, dinger, and, others, thought, that, wave, functions, represent, particles, that, are, spread, out, with, most, of, the, particle, being, where, the, wave, function, is, large, this, was, shown, to, be, incompatible, with, the, elastic, scattering, of, a, wave, packet, representing, a, particle, off, a, target, it, spreads, out, in, all, directions, while, a, scattered, particle, may, scatter, in, any, direction, it, does, not, break, up, and, take, off, in, all, directions, in, 1926, born, provided, the, perspective, of, probability, amplitude, this, relates, calculations, of, quantum, mechanics, directly, to, probabilistic, experimental, observations, it, is, accepted, as, part, of, the, copenhagen, interpretation, of, quantum, mechanics, there, are, many, other, interpretations, of, quantum, mechanics, in, 1927, hartree, and, fock, made, the, first, step, in, an, attempt, to, solve, the, n, body, wave, function, and, developed, the, self, consistency, cycle, an, iterative, algorithm, to, approximate, the, solution, now, it, is, also, known, as, the, hartree, fock, method, the, slater, determinant, and, permanent, of, a, matrix, was, part, of, the, method, provided, by, john, c, slater, schr, dinger, did, encounter, an, equation, for, the, wave, function, that, satisfied, relativistic, energy, conservation, before, he, published, the, non, relativistic, one, but, discarded, it, as, it, predicted, negative, probabilities, and, negative, energies, in, 1927, klein, gordon, and, fock, also, found, it, but, incorporated, the, electromagnetic, interaction, and, proved, that, it, was, lorentz, invariant, de, broglie, also, arrived, at, the, same, equation, in, 1928, this, relativistic, wave, equation, is, now, most, commonly, known, as, the, klein, gordon, equation, in, 1927, pauli, phenomenologically, found, a, non, relativistic, equation, to, describe, spin, 1, 2, particles, in, electromagnetic, fields, now, called, the, pauli, equation, pauli, found, the, wave, function, was, not, described, by, a, single, complex, function, of, space, and, time, but, needed, two, complex, numbers, which, respectively, correspond, to, the, spin, 1, 2, and, 1, 2, states, of, the, fermion, soon, after, in, 1928, dirac, found, an, equation, from, the, first, successful, unification, of, special, relativity, and, quantum, mechanics, applied, to, the, electron, now, called, the, dirac, equation, in, this, the, wave, function, is, a, spinor, represented, by, four, complex, valued, components, two, for, the, electron, and, two, for, the, electron, s, antiparticle, the, positron, in, the, non, relativistic, limit, the, dirac, wave, function, resembles, the, pauli, wave, function, for, the, electron, later, other, relativistic, wave, equations, were, found, all, these, wave, equations, are, of, enduring, importance, the, schr, dinger, equation, and, the, pauli, equation, are, under, many, circumstances, excellent, approximations, of, the, relativistic, variants, they, are, considerably, easier, to, solve, in, practical, problems, than, the, relativistic, counterparts, the, klein, gordon, equation, and, the, dirac, equation, while, being, relativistic, do, not, represent, full, reconciliation, of, quantum, mechanics, and, special, relativity, the, branch, of, quantum, mechanics, where, these, equations, are, studied, the, same, way, as, the, schr, dinger, equation, often, called, relativistic, quantum, mechanics, while, very, successful, has, its, limitations, see, e, g, lamb, shift, and, conceptual, problems, see, e, g, dirac, sea, relativity, makes, it, inevitable, that, the, number, of, particles, in, a, system, is, not, constant, for, full, reconciliation, quantum, field, theory, is, needed, in, this, theory, the, wave, equations, and, the, wave, functions, have, their, place, but, in, a, somewhat, different, guise, the, main, objects, of, interest, are, not, the, wave, functions, but, rather, operators, so, called, field, operators, or, just, fields, where, operator, is, understood, on, the, hilbert, space, of, states, to, be, described, next, section, it, turns, out, that, the, original, relativistic, wave, equations, and, their, solutions, are, still, needed, to, build, the, hilbert, space, moreover, the, free, fields, operators, i, e, when, interactions, are, assumed, not, to, exist, turn, out, to, formally, satisfy, the, same, equation, as, do, the, fields, wave, functions, in, many, cases, thus, the, klein, gordon, equation, spin, 0, and, the, dirac, equation, spin, 1, 2, in, this, guise, remain, in, the, theory, higher, spin, analogues, include, the, proca, equation, spin, 1, rarita, schwinger, equation, spin, 3, 2, and, more, generally, the, bargmann, wigner, equations, for, massless, free, fields, two, examples, are, the, free, field, maxwell, equation, spin, 1, and, the, free, field, einstein, equation, spin, 2, for, the, field, operators, all, of, them, are, essentially, a, direct, consequence, of, the, requirement, of, lorentz, invariance, their, solutions, must, transform, under, lorentz, transformation, in, a, prescribed, way, i, e, under, a, particular, representation, of, the, lorentz, group, and, that, together, with, few, other, reasonable, demands, e, g, the, cluster, decomposition, property, with, implications, for, causality, is, enough, to, fix, the, equations, this, applies, to, free, field, equations, interactions, are, not, included, if, a, lagrangian, density, including, interactions, is, available, then, the, lagrangian, formalism, will, yield, an, equation, of, motion, at, the, classical, level, this, equation, may, be, very, complex, and, not, amenable, to, solution, any, solution, would, refer, to, a, fixed, number, of, particles, and, would, not, account, for, the, term, interaction, as, referred, to, in, these, theories, which, involves, the, creation, and, annihilation, of, particles, and, not, external, potentials, as, in, ordinary, first, quantized, quantum, theory, in, string, theory, the, situation, remains, analogous, for, instance, a, wave, function, in, momentum, space, has, the, role, of, fourier, expansion, coefficient, in, a, general, state, of, a, particle, string, with, momentum, that, is, not, sharply, defined, for, now, consider, the, simple, case, of, a, non, relativistic, single, particle, without, spin, in, one, spatial, dimension, more, general, cases, are, discussed, below, according, to, the, postulates, of, quantum, mechanics, the, state, of, a, physical, system, at, fixed, time, t, displaystyle, t, is, given, by, the, wave, function, belonging, to, a, separable, complex, hilbert, space, as, such, the, inner, product, of, two, wave, functions, 1, and, 2, can, be, defined, as, the, complex, number, at, time, t, more, details, are, given, below, however, the, inner, product, of, a, wave, function, with, itself, is, always, a, positive, real, number, the, number, not, 2, is, called, the, norm, of, the, wave, function, the, separable, hilbert, space, being, considered, is, infinite, dimensional, which, means, there, is, no, finite, set, of, square, integrable, functions, which, can, be, added, together, in, various, combinations, to, create, every, possible, square, integrable, function, the, state, of, such, a, particle, is, completely, described, by, its, wave, function, x, t, displaystyle, psi, x, t, where, x, is, position, and, t, is, time, this, is, a, complex, valued, function, of, two, real, variables, x, and, t, for, one, spinless, particle, in, one, dimension, if, the, wave, function, is, interpreted, as, a, probability, amplitude, the, square, modulus, of, the, wave, function, the, positive, real, number, x, t, 2, x, t, x, t, x, displaystyle, left, psi, x, t, right, 2, psi, x, t, psi, x, t, rho, x, is, interpreted, as, the, probability, density, for, a, measurement, of, the, particle, s, position, at, a, given, time, t, the, asterisk, indicates, the, complex, conjugate, if, the, particle, s, position, is, measured, its, location, cannot, be, determined, from, the, wave, function, but, is, described, by, a, probability, distribution, the, probability, that, its, position, x, will, be, in, the, interval, a, x, b, is, the, integral, of, the, density, over, this, interval, p, a, x, b, t, a, b, x, t, 2, d, x, displaystyle, p, a, leq, x, leq, b, t, int, a, b, psi, x, t, 2, dx, where, t, is, the, time, at, which, the, particle, was, measured, this, leads, to, the, normalization, condition, x, t, 2, d, x, 1, displaystyle, int, infty, infty, psi, x, t, 2, dx, 1, because, if, the, particle, is, measured, there, is, 100, probability, that, it, will, be, somewhere, for, a, given, system, the, set, of, all, possible, normalizable, wave, functions, at, any, given, time, forms, an, abstract, mathematical, vector, space, meaning, that, it, is, possible, to, add, together, different, wave, functions, and, multiply, wave, functions, by, complex, numbers, technically, wave, functions, form, a, ray, in, a, projective, hilbert, space, rather, than, an, ordinary, vector, space, at, a, particular, instant, of, time, all, values, of, the, wave, function, x, t, are, components, of, a, vector, there, are, uncountably, infinitely, many, of, them, and, integration, is, used, in, place, of, summation, in, bra, ket, notation, this, vector, is, written, t, x, t, x, d, x, displaystyle, psi, t, rangle, int, psi, x, t, x, rangle, dx, and, is, referred, to, as, a, quantum, state, vector, or, simply, quantum, state, there, are, several, advantages, to, understanding, wave, functions, as, representing, elements, of, an, abstract, vector, space, the, time, parameter, is, often, suppressed, and, will, be, in, the, following, the, x, coordinate, is, a, continuous, index, the, x, are, called, improper, vectors, which, unlike, proper, vectors, that, are, normalizable, to, unity, can, only, be, normalized, to, a, dirac, delta, function, x, x, x, x, displaystyle, langle, x, x, rangle, delta, x, x, thus, x, x, x, x, d, x, x, displaystyle, langle, x, psi, rangle, int, psi, x, langle, x, x, rangle, dx, psi, x, and, x, x, d, x, x, x, d, x, displaystyle, psi, rangle, int, x, rangle, langle, x, psi, rangle, dx, left, int, x, rangle, langle, x, dx, right, psi, rangle, which, illuminates, the, identity, operator, i, x, x, d, x, displaystyle, i, int, x, rangle, langle, x, dx, which, is, analogous, to, completeness, relation, of, orthonormal, basis, in, n, dimensional, hilbert, space, finding, the, identity, operator, in, a, basis, allows, the, abstract, state, to, be, expressed, explicitly, in, a, basis, and, more, the, inner, product, between, two, state, vectors, and, other, operators, for, observables, can, be, expressed, in, the, basis, the, particle, also, has, a, wave, function, in, momentum, space, p, t, displaystyle, phi, p, t, where, p, is, the, momentum, in, one, dimension, which, can, be, any, value, from, to, and, t, is, time, analogous, to, the, position, case, the, inner, product, of, two, wave, functions, 1, p, t, and, 2, p, t, can, be, defined, as, 1, 2, 1, p, t, 2, p, t, d, p, displaystyle, phi, 1, phi, 2, int, infty, infty, phi, 1, p, t, phi, 2, p, t, dp, one, particular, solution, to, the, time, independent, schr, dinger, equation, is, p, x, e, i, p, x, displaystyle, psi, p, x, e, ipx, hbar, a, plane, wave, which, can, be, used, in, the, description, of, a, particle, with, momentum, exactly, p, since, it, is, an, eigenfunction, of, the, momentum, operator, these, functions, are, not, normalizable, to, unity, they, are, not, square, integrable, so, they, are, not, really, elements, of, physical, hilbert, space, the, set, p, x, t, p, displaystyle, psi, p, x, t, infty, leq, p, leq, infty, forms, what, is, called, the, momentum, basis, this, basis, is, not, a, basis, in, the, usual, mathematical, sense, for, one, thing, since, the, functions, are, not, normalizable, they, are, instead, normalized, to, a, delta, function, p, p, p, p, displaystyle, psi, p, psi, p, delta, p, p, for, another, thing, though, they, are, linearly, independent, there, are, too, many, of, them, they, form, an, uncountable, set, for, a, basis, for, physical, hilbert, space, they, can, still, be, used, to, express, all, functions, in, it, using, fourier, transforms, as, described, next, the, x, and, p, representations, are, i, x, x, d, x, x, x, d, x, i, p, p, d, p, p, p, d, p, displaystyle, begin, aligned, psi, rangle, i, psi, rangle, int, x, rangle, langle, x, psi, rangle, dx, int, psi, x, x, rangle, dx, psi, rangle, i, psi, rangle, int, p, rangle, langle, p, psi, rangle, dp, int, phi, p, p, rangle, dp, end, aligned, now, take, the, projection, of, the, state, onto, eigenfunctions, of, momentum, using, the, last, expression, in, the, two, equations, x, p, x, d, x, p, p, p, d, p, p, p, p, d, p, p, displaystyle, int, psi, x, langle, p, x, rangle, dx, int, phi, p, langle, p, p, rangle, dp, int, phi, p, delta, p, p, dp, phi, p, then, utilizing, the, known, expression, for, suitably, normalized, eigenstates, of, momentum, in, the, position, representation, solutions, of, the, free, schr, dinger, equation, x, p, p, x, 1, 2, e, i, p, x, p, x, 1, 2, e, i, p, x, displaystyle, langle, x, p, rangle, p, x, frac, 1, sqrt, 2, pi, hbar, e, frac, i, hbar, px, rightarrow, langle, p, x, rangle, frac, 1, sqrt, 2, pi, hbar, e, frac, i, hbar, px, one, obtains, p, 1, 2, x, e, i, p, x, d, x, displaystyle, phi, p, frac, 1, sqrt, 2, pi, hbar, int, psi, x, e, frac, i, hbar, px, dx, likewise, using, eigenfunctions, of, position, x, 1, 2, p, e, i, p, x, d, p, displaystyle, psi, x, frac, 1, sqrt, 2, pi, hbar, int, phi, p, e, frac, i, hbar, px, dp, the, position, space, and, momentum, space, wave, functions, are, thus, found, to, be, fourier, transforms, of, each, other, they, are, two, representations, of, the, same, state, containing, the, same, information, and, either, one, is, sufficient, to, calculate, any, property, of, the, particle, in, practice, the, position, space, wave, function, is, used, much, more, often, than, the, momentum, space, wave, function, the, potential, entering, the, relevant, equation, schr, dinger, dirac, etc, determines, in, which, basis, the, description, is, easiest, for, the, harmonic, oscillator, x, and, p, enter, symmetrically, so, there, it, does, not, matter, which, description, one, uses, the, same, equation, modulo, constants, results, from, this, with, a, little, bit, of, afterthought, it, follows, that, solutions, to, the, wave, equation, of, the, harmonic, oscillator, are, eigenfunctions, of, the, fourier, transform, in, l, 2, following, are, the, general, forms, of, the, wave, function, for, systems, in, higher, dimensions, and, more, particles, as, well, as, including, other, degrees, of, freedom, than, position, coordinates, or, momentum, components, while, hilbert, spaces, originally, refer, to, infinite, dimensional, complete, inner, product, spaces, they, by, definition, include, finite, dimensional, complete, inner, product, spaces, as, well, in, physics, they, are, often, referred, to, as, finite, dimensional, hilbert, spaces, for, every, finite, dimensional, hilbert, space, there, exist, orthonormal, basis, kets, that, span, the, entire, hilbert, space, if, the, n, dimensional, set, i, textstyle, phi, i, rangle, is, orthonormal, then, the, projection, operator, for, the, space, spanned, by, these, states, is, given, by, p, i, i, i, i, displaystyle, p, sum, i, phi, i, rangle, langle, phi, i, i, where, the, projection, is, equivalent, to, identity, operator, since, i, textstyle, phi, i, rangle, spans, the, entire, hilbert, space, thus, leaving, any, vector, from, hilbert, space, unchanged, this, is, also, known, as, completeness, relation, of, finite, dimensional, hilbert, space, the, wavefunction, is, instead, given, by, i, i, i, i, displaystyle, psi, rangle, i, psi, rangle, sum, i, phi, i, rangle, langle, phi, i, psi, rangle, where, i, textstyle, langle, phi, i, psi, rangle, is, a, set, of, complex, numbers, which, can, be, used, to, construct, a, wavefunction, using, the, above, formula, if, the, set, i, textstyle, phi, i, rangle, are, eigenkets, of, a, non, degenerate, observable, with, eigenvalues, i, textstyle, lambda, i, by, the, postulates, of, quantum, mechanics, the, probability, of, measuring, the, observable, to, be, i, textstyle, lambda, i, is, given, according, to, born, rule, as, p, i, i, 2, displaystyle, p, psi, lambda, i, langle, phi, i, psi, rangle, 2, for, non, degenerate, i, textstyle, phi, i, rangle, of, some, observable, if, eigenvalues, textstyle, lambda, have, subset, of, eigenvectors, labelled, as, j, textstyle, lambda, j, rangle, by, the, postulates, of, quantum, mechanics, the, probability, of, measuring, the, observable, to, be, i, textstyle, lambda, i, is, given, by, p, j, j, 2, p, 2, displaystyle, p, psi, lambda, sum, j, langle, lambda, j, psi, rangle, 2, widehat, p, lambda, psi, rangle, 2, where, p, j, j, j, textstyle, widehat, p, lambda, sum, j, lambda, j, rangle, langle, lambda, j, is, a, projection, operator, of, states, to, subspace, spanned, by, j, textstyle, lambda, j, rangle, the, equality, follows, due, to, orthogonal, nature, of, i, textstyle, phi, i, rangle, hence, i, textstyle, langle, phi, i, psi, rangle, which, specify, state, of, the, quantum, mechanical, system, have, magnitudes, whose, square, gives, the, probability, of, measuring, the, respective, i, textstyle, phi, i, rangle, state, while, the, relative, phase, has, observable, effects, in, experiments, the, global, phase, of, the, system, is, experimentally, indistinguishable, for, example, in, a, particle, in, superposition, of, two, states, the, global, phase, of, the, particle, cannot, be, distinguished, by, finding, expectation, value, of, observable, or, probabilities, of, observing, different, states, but, relative, phases, can, affect, the, expectation, values, of, observables, while, the, overall, phase, of, the, system, is, considered, to, be, arbitrary, the, relative, phase, for, each, state, i, textstyle, phi, i, rangle, of, a, prepared, state, in, superposition, can, be, determined, based, on, physical, meaning, of, the, prepared, state, and, its, symmetry, for, example, the, construction, of, spin, states, along, x, direction, as, a, superposition, of, spin, states, along, z, direction, can, done, by, applying, appropriate, rotation, transformation, on, the, spin, along, z, states, which, provides, appropriate, phase, of, the, states, relative, to, each, other, an, example, of, finite, dimensional, hilbert, space, can, be, constructed, using, spin, eigenkets, of, s, textstyle, s, spin, particles, which, forms, a, 2, s, 1, textstyle, 2s, 1, dimensional, hilbert, space, however, the, general, wavefunction, of, a, particle, that, fully, describes, its, state, is, always, from, an, infinite, dimensional, hilbert, space, since, it, involves, a, tensor, product, with, hilbert, space, relating, to, the, position, or, momentum, of, the, particle, nonetheless, the, techniques, developed, for, finite, dimensional, hilbert, space, are, useful, since, they, can, either, be, treated, independently, or, treated, in, consideration, of, linearity, of, tensor, product,

similar, solutions, this, solution, does, not, take, into, account, the, spin, of, the, electron, in, the, figure, of, the, hydrogen, orbitals, the, 19, sub, images, are, images, of, wave, functions, in, position, space, their, norm, squared, the, wave, functions, represent, the, abstract, state, characterized, by, the, triple, of, quantum, numbers, n, m, in, the, lower, right, of, each, image, these, are, the, principal, quantum, number, the, orbital, angular, momentum, quantum, number, and, the, magnetic, quantum, number, together, with, one, spin, projection, quantum, number, of, the, electron, this, is, a, complete, set, of, observables, the, figure, can, serve, to, illustrate, some, further, properties, of, the, function, spaces, of, wave, functions, the, concept, of, function, spaces, enters, naturally, in, the, discussion, about, wave, functions, a, function, space, is, a, set, of, functions, usually, with, some, defining, requirements, on, the, functions, in, the, present, case, that, they, are, square, integrable, sometimes, with, an, algebraic, structure, on, the, set, in, the, present, case, a, vector, space, structure, with, an, inner, product, together, with, a, topology, on, the, set, the, latter, will, sparsely, be, used, here, it, is, only, needed, to, obtain, a, precise, definition, of, what, it, means, for, a, subset, of, a, function, space, to, be, closed, it, will, be, concluded, below, that, the, function, space, of, wave, functions, is, a, hilbert, space, this, observation, is, the, foundation, of, the, predominant, mathematical, formulation, of, quantum, mechanics, a, wave, function, is, an, element, of, a, function, space, partly, characterized, by, the, following, concrete, and, abstract, descriptions, this, similarity, is, of, course, not, accidental, there, are, also, a, distinctions, between, the, spaces, to, keep, in, mind, basic, states, are, characterized, by, a, set, of, quantum, numbers, this, is, a, set, of, eigenvalues, of, a, maximal, set, of, commuting, observables, physical, observables, are, represented, by, linear, operators, also, called, observables, on, the, vectors, space, maximality, means, that, there, can, be, added, to, the, set, no, further, algebraically, independent, observables, that, commute, with, the, ones, already, present, a, choice, of, such, a, set, may, be, called, a, choice, of, representation, the, abstract, states, are, abstract, only, in, that, an, arbitrary, choice, necessary, for, a, particular, explicit, description, of, it, is, not, given, this, is, the, same, as, saying, that, no, choice, of, maximal, set, of, commuting, observables, has, been, given, this, is, analogous, to, a, vector, space, without, a, specified, basis, wave, functions, corresponding, to, a, state, are, accordingly, not, unique, this, non, uniqueness, reflects, the, non, uniqueness, in, the, choice, of, a, maximal, set, of, commuting, observables, for, one, spin, particle, in, one, dimension, to, a, particular, state, there, corresponds, two, wave, functions, x, s, z, and, p, s, y, both, describing, the, same, state, each, choice, of, representation, should, be, thought, of, as, specifying, a, unique, function, space, in, which, wave, functions, corresponding, to, that, choice, of, representation, lives, this, distinction, is, best, kept, even, if, one, could, argue, that, two, such, function, spaces, are, mathematically, equal, e, g, being, the, set, of, square, integrable, functions, one, can, then, think, of, the, function, spaces, as, two, distinct, copies, of, that, set, there, is, an, additional, algebraic, structure, on, the, vector, spaces, of, wave, functions, and, the, abstract, state, space, this, motivates, the, introduction, of, an, inner, product, on, the, vector, space, of, abstract, quantum, states, compatible, with, the, mathematical, observations, above, when, passing, to, a, representation, it, is, denoted, or, in, the, bra, ket, notation, it, yields, a, complex, number, with, the, inner, product, the, function, space, is, an, inner, product, space, the, explicit, appearance, of, the, inner, product, usually, an, integral, or, a, sum, of, integrals, depends, on, the, choice, of, representation, but, the, complex, number, does, not, much, of, the, physical, interpretation, of, quantum, mechanics, stems, from, the, born, rule, it, states, that, the, probability, p, of, finding, upon, measurement, the, state, given, the, system, is, in, the, state, is, p, 2, displaystyle, p, phi, psi, 2, where, and, are, assumed, normalized, consider, a, scattering, experiment, in, quantum, field, theory, if, out, describes, a, state, in, the, distant, future, an, out, state, after, interactions, between, scattering, particles, have, ceased, and, in, an, in, state, in, the, distant, past, then, the, quantities, out, in, with, out, and, in, varying, over, a, complete, set, of, in, states, and, out, states, respectively, is, called, the, s, matrix, or, scattering, matrix, knowledge, of, it, is, effectively, having, solved, the, theory, at, hand, at, least, as, far, as, predictions, go, measurable, quantities, such, as, decay, rates, and, scattering, cross, sections, are, calculable, from, the, s, matrix, the, above, observations, encapsulate, the, essence, of, the, function, spaces, of, which, wave, functions, are, elements, however, the, description, is, not, yet, complete, there, is, a, further, technical, requirement, on, the, function, space, that, of, completeness, that, allows, one, to, take, limits, of, sequences, in, the, function, space, and, be, ensured, that, if, the, limit, exists, it, is, an, element, of, the, function, space, a, complete, inner, product, space, is, called, a, hilbert, space, the, property, of, completeness, is, crucial, in, advanced, treatments, and, applications, of, quantum, mechanics, for, instance, the, existence, of, projection, operators, or, orthogonal, projections, relies, on, the, completeness, of, the, space, these, projection, operators, in, turn, are, essential, for, the, statement, and, proof, of, many, useful, theorems, e, g, the, spectral, theorem, it, is, not, very, important, in, introductory, quantum, mechanics, and, technical, details, and, links, may, be, found, in, footnotes, like, the, one, that, follows, the, space, l, 2, is, a, hilbert, space, with, inner, product, presented, later, the, function, space, of, the, example, of, the, figure, is, a, subspace, of, l, 2, a, subspace, of, a, hilbert, space, is, a, hilbert, space, if, it, is, closed, in, summary, the, set, of, all, possible, normalizable, wave, functions, for, a, system, with, a, particular, choice, of, basis, together, with, the, null, vector, constitute, a, hilbert, space, not, all, functions, of, interest, are, elements, of, some, hilbert, space, say, l, 2, the, most, glaring, example, is, the, set, of, functions, e, 2, i, p, x, h, these, are, plane, wave, solutions, of, the, schr, dinger, equation, for, a, free, particle, but, are, not, normalizable, hence, not, in, l, 2, but, they, are, nonetheless, fundamental, for, the, description, one, can, using, them, express, functions, that, are, normalizable, using, wave, packets, they, are, in, a, sense, a, basis, but, not, a, hilbert, space, basis, nor, a, hamel, basis, in, which, wave, functions, of, interest, can, be, expressed, there, is, also, the, artifact, normalization, to, a, delta, function, that, is, frequently, employed, for, notational, convenience, see, further, down, the, delta, functions, themselves, are, not, square, integrable, either, the, above, description, of, the, function, space, containing, the, wave, functions, is, mostly, mathematically, motivated, the, function, spaces, are, due, to, completeness, very, large, in, a, certain, sense, not, all, functions, are, realistic, descriptions, of, any, physical, system, for, instance, in, the, function, space, l, 2, one, can, find, the, function, that, takes, on, the, value, 0, for, all, rational, numbers, and, i, for, the, irrationals, in, the, interval, this, is, square, integrable, but, can, hardly, represent, a, physical, state, while, the, space, of, solutions, as, a, whole, is, a, hilbert, space, there, are, many, other, hilbert, spaces, that, commonly, occur, as, ingredients, more, generally, one, may, consider, a, unified, treatment, of, all, second, order, polynomial, solutions, to, the, sturm, liouville, equations, in, the, setting, of, hilbert, space, these, include, the, legendre, and, laguerre, polynomials, as, well, as, chebyshev, polynomials, jacobi, polynomials, and, hermite, polynomials, all, of, these, actually, appear, in, physical, problems, the, latter, ones, in, the, harmonic, oscillator, and, what, is, otherwise, a, bewildering, maze, of, properties, of, special, functions, becomes, an, organized, body, of, facts, for, this, see, byron, fuller, 1992, chapter, 5, there, occurs, also, finite, dimensional, hilbert, spaces, the, space, c, n, is, a, hilbert, space, of, dimension, n, the, inner, product, is, the, standard, inner, product, on, these, spaces, in, it, the, spin, part, of, a, single, particle, wave, function, resides, with, more, particles, the, situations, is, more, complicated, one, has, to, employ, tensor, products, and, use, representation, theory, of, the, symmetry, groups, involved, the, rotation, group, and, the, lorentz, group, respectively, to, extract, from, the, tensor, product, the, spaces, in, which, the, total, spin, wave, functions, reside, further, problems, arise, in, the, relativistic, case, unless, the, particles, are, free, see, the, bethe, salpeter, equation, corresponding, remarks, apply, to, the, concept, of, isospin, for, which, the, symmetry, group, is, su, 2, the, models, of, the, nuclear, forces, of, the, sixties, still, useful, today, see, nuclear, force, used, the, symmetry, group, su, 3, in, this, case, as, well, the, part, of, the, wave, functions, corresponding, to, the, inner, symmetries, reside, in, some, c, n, or, subspaces, of, tensor, products, of, such, spaces, due, to, the, infinite, dimensional, nature, of, the, system, the, appropriate, mathematical, tools, are, objects, of, study, in, functional, analysis, not, all, introductory, textbooks, take, the, long, route, and, introduce, the, full, hilbert, space, machinery, but, the, focus, is, on, the, non, relativistic, schr, dinger, equation, in, position, representation, for, certain, standard, potentials, the, following, constraints, on, the, wave, function, are, sometimes, explicitly, formulated, for, the, calculations, and, physical, interpretation, to, make, sense, it, is, possible, to, relax, these, conditions, somewhat, for, special, purposes, if, these, requirements, are, not, met, it, is, not, possible, to, interpret, the, wave, function, as, a, probability, amplitude, note, that, exceptions, can, arise, to, the, continuity, of, derivatives, rule, at, points, of, infinite, discontinuity, of, potential, field, for, example, in, particle, in, a, box, where, the, derivative, of, wavefunction, can, be, discontinuous, at, the, boundary, of, the, box, where, the, potential, is, known, to, have, infinite, discontinuity, this, does, not, alter, the, structure, of, the, hilbert, space, that, these, particular, wave, functions, inhabit, but, the, subspace, of, the, square, integrable, functions, l, 2, which, is, a, hilbert, space, satisfying, the, second, requirement, is, not, closed, in, l, 2, hence, not, a, hilbert, space, in, itself, the, functions, that, does, not, meet, the, requirements, are, still, needed, for, both, technical, and, practical, reasons, as, has, been, demonstrated, the, set, of, all, possible, wave, functions, in, some, representation, for, a, system, constitute, an, in, general, infinite, dimensional, hilbert, space, due, to, the, multiple, possible, choices, of, representation, basis, these, hilbert, spaces, are, not, unique, one, therefore, talks, about, an, abstract, hilbert, space, state, space, where, the, choice, of, representation, and, basis, is, left, undetermined, specifically, each, state, is, represented, as, an, abstract, vector, in, state, space, a, quantum, state, in, any, representation, is, generally, expressed, as, a, vector, d, m, t, displaystyle, psi, rangle, sum, boldsymbol, alpha, int, d, m, boldsymbol, omega, psi, boldsymbol, alpha, boldsymbol, omega, t, boldsymbol, alpha, boldsymbol, omega, rangle, where, these, quantum, numbers, index, the, components, of, the, state, vector, more, all, are, in, an, n, dimensional, set, a, a, 1, a, 2, a, n, where, each, a, i, is, the, set, of, allowed, values, for, i, all, are, in, an, m, dimensional, volume, m, where, 1, 2, m, and, each, i, r, is, the, set, of, allowed, values, for, i, a, subset, of, the, real, numbers, r, for, generality, n, and, m, are, not, necessarily, equal, example, the, probability, density, of, finding, the, system, at, time, t, displaystyle, t, at, state, is, t, t, 2, displaystyle, rho, alpha, omega, t, psi, boldsymbol, alpha, boldsymbol, omega, t, 2, the, probability, of, finding, system, with, in, some, or, all, possible, discrete, variable, configurations, d, a, and, in, some, or, all, possible, continuous, variable, configurations, c, is, the, sum, and, integral, over, the, density, p, t, d, c, t, d, m, displaystyle, p, t, sum, boldsymbol, alpha, in, d, int, c, rho, alpha, omega, t, d, m, boldsymbol, omega, since, the, sum, of, all, probabilities, must, be, 1, the, normalization, condition, 1, a, t, d, m, displaystyle, 1, sum, boldsymbol, alpha, in, a, int, omega, rho, alpha, omega, t, d, m, boldsymbol, omega, must, hold, at, all, times, during, the, evolution, of, the, system, the, normalization, condition, requires, d, m, to, be, dimensionless, by, dimensional, analysis, must, have, the, same, units, as, 1, 2, m, 1, 2, whether, the, wave, function, exists, in, reality, and, what, it, represents, are, major, questions, in, the, interpretation, of, quantum, mechanics, many, famous, physicists, of, a, previous, generation, puzzled, over, this, problem, such, as, erwin, schr, dinger, albert, einstein, and, niels, bohr, some, advocate, formulations, or, variants, of, the, copenhagen, interpretation, e, g, bohr, eugene, wigner, and, john, von, neumann, while, others, such, as, john, archibald, wheeler, or, edwin, thompson, jaynes, take, the, more, classical, approach, and, regard, the, wave, function, as, representing, information, in, the, mind, of, the, observer, i, e, a, measure, of, our, knowledge, of, reality, some, including, schr, dinger, david, bohm, and, hugh, everett, iii, and, others, argued, that, the, wave, function, must, have, an, objective, physical, existence, einstein, thought, that, a, complete, description, of, physical, reality, should, refer, directly, to, physical, space, and, time, as, distinct, from, the, wave, function, which, refers, to, an, abstract, mathematical, space
