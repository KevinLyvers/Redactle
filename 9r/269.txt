a, stellar, magnetic, field, is, a, magnetic, field, generated, by, the, motion, of, conductive, plasma, inside, a, star, this, motion, is, created, through, convection, which, is, a, form, of, energy, transport, involving, the, physical, movement, of, material, a, localized, magnetic, field, exerts, a, force, on, the, plasma, effectively, increasing, the, pressure, without, a, comparable, gain, in, density, as, a, result, the, magnetized, region, rises, relative, to, the, remainder, of, the, plasma, until, it, reaches, the, star, s, photosphere, this, creates, starspots, on, the, surface, and, the, related, phenomenon, of, coronal, loops, a, star, s, magnetic, field, can, be, measured, using, the, zeeman, effect, normally, the, atoms, in, a, star, s, atmosphere, will, absorb, certain, frequencies, of, energy, in, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, producing, characteristic, dark, absorption, lines, in, the, spectrum, however, when, the, atoms, are, within, a, magnetic, field, these, lines, become, split, into, multiple, closely, spaced, lines, the, energy, also, becomes, polarized, with, an, orientation, that, depends, on, the, orientation, of, the, magnetic, field, thus, the, strength, and, direction, of, the, star, s, magnetic, field, can, be, determined, by, examination, of, the, zeeman, effect, lines, a, stellar, spectropolarimeter, is, used, to, measure, the, magnetic, field, of, a, star, this, instrument, consists, of, a, spectrograph, combined, with, a, polarimeter, the, first, instrument, to, be, dedicated, to, the, study, of, stellar, magnetic, fields, was, narval, which, was, mounted, on, the, bernard, lyot, telescope, at, the, pic, du, midi, de, bigorre, in, the, french, pyrenees, mountains, various, measurements, including, magnetometer, measurements, over, the, last, 150, years, 14, c, in, tree, rings, and, 10, be, in, ice, cores, have, established, substantial, magnetic, variability, of, the, sun, on, decadal, centennial, and, millennial, time, scales, stellar, magnetic, fields, according, to, solar, dynamo, theory, are, caused, within, the, convective, zone, of, the, star, the, convective, circulation, of, the, conducting, plasma, functions, like, a, dynamo, this, activity, destroys, the, star, s, primordial, magnetic, field, then, generates, a, dipolar, magnetic, field, as, the, star, undergoes, differential, rotation, rotating, at, different, rates, for, various, latitudes, the, magnetism, is, wound, into, a, toroidal, field, of, flux, ropes, that, become, wrapped, around, the, star, the, fields, can, become, highly, concentrated, producing, activity, when, they, emerge, on, the, surface, the, magnetic, field, of, a, rotating, body, of, conductive, gas, or, liquid, develops, self, amplifying, electric, currents, and, thus, a, self, generated, magnetic, field, due, to, a, combination, of, differential, rotation, different, angular, velocity, of, different, parts, of, body, coriolis, forces, and, induction, the, distribution, of, currents, can, be, quite, complicated, with, numerous, open, and, closed, loops, and, thus, the, magnetic, field, of, these, currents, in, their, immediate, vicinity, is, also, quite, twisted, at, large, distances, however, the, magnetic, fields, of, currents, flowing, in, opposite, directions, cancel, out, and, only, a, net, dipole, field, survives, slowly, diminishing, with, distance, because, the, major, currents, flow, in, the, direction, of, conductive, mass, motion, equatorial, currents, the, major, component, of, the, generated, magnetic, field, is, the, dipole, field, of, the, equatorial, current, loop, thus, producing, magnetic, poles, near, the, geographic, poles, of, a, rotating, body, the, magnetic, fields, of, all, celestial, bodies, are, often, aligned, with, the, direction, of, rotation, with, notable, exceptions, such, as, certain, pulsars, another, feature, of, this, dynamo, model, is, that, the, currents, are, ac, rather, than, dc, their, direction, and, thus, the, direction, of, the, magnetic, field, they, generate, alternates, more, or, less, periodically, changing, amplitude, and, reversing, direction, although, still, more, or, less, aligned, with, the, axis, of, rotation, the, sun, s, major, component, of, magnetic, field, reverses, direction, every, 11, years, so, the, period, is, about, 22, years, resulting, in, a, diminished, magnitude, of, magnetic, field, near, reversal, time, during, this, dormancy, the, sunspots, activity, is, at, maximum, because, of, the, lack, of, magnetic, braking, on, plasma, and, as, a, result, massive, ejection, of, high, energy, plasma, into, the, solar, corona, and, interplanetary, space, takes, place, collisions, of, neighboring, sunspots, with, oppositely, directed, magnetic, fields, result, in, the, generation, of, strong, electric, fields, near, rapidly, disappearing, magnetic, field, regions, this, electric, field, accelerates, electrons, and, protons, to, high, energies, kiloelectronvolts, which, results, in, jets, of, extremely, hot, plasma, leaving, the, sun, s, surface, and, heating, coronal, plasma, to, high, temperatures, millions, of, kelvin, if, the, gas, or, liquid, is, very, viscous, resulting, in, turbulent, differential, motion, the, reversal, of, the, magnetic, field, may, not, be, very, periodic, this, is, the, case, with, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, which, is, generated, by, turbulent, currents, in, a, viscous, outer, core, starspots, are, regions, of, intense, magnetic, activity, on, the, surface, of, a, star, on, the, sun, they, are, termed, sunspots, these, form, a, visible, component, of, magnetic, flux, tubes, that, are, formed, within, a, star, s, convection, zone, due, to, the, differential, rotation, of, the, star, the, tube, becomes, curled, up, and, stretched, inhibiting, convection, and, producing, zones, of, lower, than, normal, temperature, coronal, loops, often, form, above, starspots, forming, from, magnetic, field, lines, that, stretch, out, into, the, stellar, corona, these, in, turn, serve, to, heat, the, corona, to, temperatures, over, a, million, kelvins, the, magnetic, fields, linked, to, starspots, and, coronal, loops, are, linked, to, flare, activity, and, the, associated, coronal, mass, ejection, the, plasma, is, heated, to, tens, of, millions, of, kelvins, and, the, particles, are, accelerated, away, from, the, star, s, surface, at, extreme, velocities, surface, activity, appears, to, be, related, to, the, age, and, rotation, rate, of, main, sequence, stars, young, stars, with, a, rapid, rate, of, rotation, exhibit, strong, activity, by, contrast, middle, aged, sun, like, stars, with, a, slow, rate, of, rotation, show, low, levels, of, activity, that, varies, in, cycles, some, older, stars, display, almost, no, activity, which, may, mean, they, have, entered, a, lull, that, is, comparable, to, the, sun, s, maunder, minimum, measurements, of, the, time, variation, in, stellar, activity, can, be, useful, for, determining, the, differential, rotation, rates, of, a, star, a, star, with, a, magnetic, field, will, generate, a, magnetosphere, that, extends, outward, into, the, surrounding, space, field, lines, from, this, field, originate, at, one, magnetic, pole, on, the, star, then, end, at, the, other, pole, forming, a, closed, loop, the, magnetosphere, contains, charged, particles, that, are, trapped, from, the, stellar, wind, which, then, move, along, these, field, lines, as, the, star, rotates, the, magnetosphere, rotates, with, it, dragging, along, the, charged, particles, as, stars, emit, matter, with, a, stellar, wind, from, the, photosphere, the, magnetosphere, creates, a, torque, on, the, ejected, matter, this, results, in, a, transfer, of, angular, momentum, from, the, star, to, the, surrounding, space, causing, a, slowing, of, the, stellar, rotation, rate, rapidly, rotating, stars, have, a, higher, mass, loss, rate, resulting, in, a, faster, loss, of, momentum, as, the, rotation, rate, slows, so, too, does, the, angular, deceleration, by, this, means, a, star, will, gradually, approach, but, never, quite, reach, the, state, of, zero, rotation, a, t, tauri, star, is, a, type, of, pre, main, sequence, star, that, is, being, heated, through, gravitational, contraction, and, has, not, yet, begun, to, burn, hydrogen, at, its, core, they, are, variable, stars, that, are, magnetically, active, the, magnetic, field, of, these, stars, is, thought, to, interact, with, its, strong, stellar, wind, transferring, angular, momentum, to, the, surrounding, protoplanetary, disk, this, allows, the, star, to, brake, its, rotation, rate, as, it, collapses, small, m, class, stars, with, 0, 1, 0, 6, solar, masses, that, exhibit, rapid, irregular, variability, are, known, as, flare, stars, these, fluctuations, are, hypothesized, to, be, caused, by, flares, although, the, activity, is, much, stronger, relative, to, the, size, of, the, star, the, flares, on, this, class, of, stars, can, extend, up, to, 20, of, the, circumference, and, radiate, much, of, their, energy, in, the, blue, and, ultraviolet, portion, of, the, spectrum, straddling, the, boundary, between, stars, that, undergo, nuclear, fusion, in, their, cores, and, non, hydrogen, fusing, brown, dwarfs, are, the, ultracool, dwarfs, these, objects, can, emit, radio, waves, due, to, their, strong, magnetic, fields, approximately, 5, 10, of, these, objects, have, had, their, magnetic, fields, measured, the, coolest, of, these, 2mass, j10475385, 2124234, with, a, temperature, of, 800, 900, k, retains, a, magnetic, field, stronger, than, 1, 7, kg, making, it, some, 3000, times, stronger, than, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, radio, observations, also, suggest, that, their, magnetic, fields, periodically, change, their, orientation, similar, to, the, sun, during, the, solar, cycle, planetary, nebulae, are, created, when, a, red, giant, star, ejects, its, outer, envelope, forming, an, expanding, shell, of, gas, however, it, remains, a, mystery, why, these, shells, are, not, always, spherically, symmetrical, 80, of, planetary, nebulae, do, not, have, a, spherical, shape, instead, forming, bipolar, or, elliptical, nebulae, one, hypothesis, for, the, formation, of, a, non, spherical, shape, is, the, effect, of, the, star, s, magnetic, field, instead, of, expanding, evenly, in, all, directions, the, ejected, plasma, tends, to, leave, by, way, of, the, magnetic, poles, observations, of, the, central, stars, in, at, least, four, planetary, nebulae, have, confirmed, that, they, do, indeed, possess, powerful, magnetic, fields, after, some, massive, stars, have, ceased, thermonuclear, fusion, a, portion, of, their, mass, collapses, into, a, compact, body, of, neutrons, called, a, neutron, star, these, bodies, retain, a, significant, magnetic, field, from, the, original, star, but, the, collapse, in, size, causes, the, strength, of, this, field, to, increase, dramatically, the, rapid, rotation, of, these, collapsed, neutron, stars, results, in, a, pulsar, which, emits, a, narrow, beam, of, energy, that, can, periodically, point, toward, an, observer, compact, and, fast, rotating, astronomical, objects, white, dwarfs, neutron, stars, and, black, holes, have, extremely, strong, magnetic, fields, the, magnetic, field, of, a, newly, born, fast, spinning, neutron, star, is, so, strong, up, to, 10, 8, teslas, that, it, electromagnetically, radiates, enough, energy, to, quickly, in, a, matter, of, few, million, years, damp, down, the, star, rotation, by, 100, to, 1000, times, matter, falling, on, a, neutron, star, also, has, to, follow, the, magnetic, field, lines, resulting, in, two, hot, spots, on, the, surface, where, it, can, reach, and, collide, with, the, star, s, surface, these, spots, are, literally, a, few, feet, about, a, metre, across, but, tremendously, bright, their, periodic, eclipsing, during, star, rotation, is, hypothesized, to, be, the, source, of, pulsating, radiation, see, pulsars, an, extreme, form, of, a, magnetized, neutron, star, is, the, magnetar, these, are, formed, as, the, result, of, a, core, collapse, supernova, the, existence, of, such, stars, was, confirmed, in, 1998, with, the, measurement, of, the, star, sgr, 1806, 20, the, magnetic, field, of, this, star, has, increased, the, surface, temperature, to, 18, million, k, and, it, releases, enormous, amounts, of, energy, in, gamma, ray, bursts, jets, of, relativistic, plasma, are, often, observed, along, the, direction, of, the, magnetic, poles, of, active, black, holes, in, the, centers, of, very, young, galaxies, in, 2008, a, team, of, astronomers, first, described, how, as, the, exoplanet, orbiting, hd, 189733, a, reaches, a, certain, place, in, its, orbit, it, causes, increased, stellar, flaring, in, 2010, a, different, team, found, that, every, time, they, observe, the, exoplanet, at, a, certain, position, in, its, orbit, they, also, detected, x, ray, flares, theoretical, research, since, 2000, suggested, that, an, exoplanet, very, near, to, the, star, that, it, orbits, may, cause, increased, flaring, due, to, the, interaction, of, their, magnetic, fields, or, because, of, tidal, forces, in, 2019, astronomers, combined, data, from, arecibo, observatory, most, and, the, automated, photoelectric, telescope, in, addition, to, historical, observations, of, the, star, at, radio, optical, ultraviolet, and, x, ray, wavelengths, to, examine, these, claims, their, analysis, found, that, the, previous, claims, were, exaggerated, and, the, host, star, failed, to, display, many, of, the, brightness, and, spectral, characteristics, associated, with, stellar, flaring, and, solar, active, regions, including, sunspots, they, also, found, that, the, claims, did, not, stand, up, to, statistical, analysis, given, that, many, stellar, flares, are, seen, regardless, of, the, position, of, the, exoplanet, therefore, debunking, the, earlier, claims, the, magnetic, fields, of, the, host, star, and, exoplanet, do, not, interact, and, this, system, is, no, longer, believed, to, have, a, star, planet, interaction
