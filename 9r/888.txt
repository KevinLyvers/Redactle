boiling, or, ebullition, is, the, rapid, phase, transition, from, liquid, to, gas, or, vapor, the, reverse, of, boiling, is, condensation, boiling, occurs, when, a, liquid, is, heated, to, its, boiling, point, so, that, the, vapour, pressure, of, the, liquid, is, equal, to, the, pressure, exerted, on, the, liquid, by, the, surrounding, atmosphere, boiling, and, evaporation, are, the, two, main, forms, of, liquid, vapourization, there, are, two, main, types, of, boiling, nucleate, boiling, where, small, bubbles, of, vapour, form, at, discrete, points, and, critical, heat, flux, boiling, where, the, boiling, surface, is, heated, above, a, certain, critical, temperature, and, a, film, of, vapour, forms, on, the, surface, transition, boiling, is, an, intermediate, unstable, form, of, boiling, with, elements, of, both, types, the, boiling, point, of, water, is, 100, c, or, 212, f, but, is, lower, with, the, decreased, atmospheric, pressure, found, at, higher, altitudes, boiling, water, is, used, as, a, method, of, making, it, potable, by, killing, microbes, and, viruses, that, may, be, present, the, sensitivity, of, different, micro, organisms, to, heat, varies, but, if, water, is, held, at, 100, c, 212, f, for, one, minute, most, micro, organisms, and, viruses, are, inactivated, ten, minutes, at, a, temperature, of, 70, c, 158, f, is, also, sufficient, to, inactivate, most, bacteria, boiling, water, is, also, used, in, several, cooking, methods, including, boiling, steaming, and, poaching, the, lowest, heat, flux, seen, in, boiling, is, only, sufficient, to, cause, where, the, warmer, fluid, rises, due, to, its, slightly, lower, density, this, condition, occurs, only, when, the, superheat, is, very, low, meaning, that, the, hot, surface, near, the, fluid, is, nearly, the, same, temperature, as, the, boiling, point, nucleate, boiling, is, characterised, by, the, growth, of, bubbles, or, pops, on, a, heated, surface, heterogeneous, nucleation, which, rises, from, discrete, points, on, a, surface, whose, temperature, is, only, slightly, above, the, temperature, of, the, liquid, in, general, the, number, of, nucleation, sites, is, increased, by, an, increasing, surface, temperature, an, irregular, surface, of, the, boiling, vessel, i, e, increased, surface, roughness, or, additives, to, the, fluid, i, e, surfactants, and, or, nanoparticles, facilitate, nucleate, boiling, over, a, broader, temperature, range, while, an, exceptionally, smooth, surface, such, as, plastic, lends, itself, to, superheating, under, these, conditions, a, heated, liquid, may, show, boiling, delay, and, the, temperature, may, go, somewhat, above, the, boiling, point, without, boiling, homogeneous, nucleation, where, the, bubbles, form, from, the, surrounding, liquid, instead, of, on, a, surface, can, occur, if, the, liquid, is, warmer, in, its, center, and, cooler, at, the, surfaces, of, the, container, this, can, be, done, for, instance, in, a, microwave, oven, which, heats, the, water, and, not, the, container, critical, heat, flux, chf, describes, the, thermal, limit, of, a, phenomenon, where, a, phase, change, occurs, during, heating, such, as, bubbles, forming, on, a, metal, surface, used, to, heat, water, which, suddenly, decreases, the, efficiency, of, heat, transfer, thus, causing, localised, overheating, of, the, heating, surface, as, the, boiling, surface, is, heated, above, a, critical, temperature, a, film, of, vapour, forms, on, the, surface, since, this, vapour, film, is, much, less, capable, of, carrying, heat, away, from, the, surface, the, temperature, rises, very, rapidly, beyond, this, point, into, the, transition, boiling, regime, the, point, at, which, this, occurs, is, dependent, on, the, characteristics, of, boiling, fluid, and, the, heating, surface, in, question, transition, boiling, may, be, defined, as, the, unstable, boiling, which, occurs, at, surface, temperatures, between, the, maximum, attainable, in, nucleate, and, the, minimum, attainable, in, film, boiling, the, formation, of, bubbles, in, a, heated, liquid, is, a, complex, physical, process, which, often, involves, cavitation, and, acoustic, effects, such, as, the, broad, spectrum, hiss, one, hears, in, a, kettle, not, yet, heated, to, the, point, where, bubbles, boil, to, the, surface, if, a, surface, heating, the, liquid, is, significantly, hotter, than, the, liquid, then, film, boiling, will, occur, where, a, thin, layer, of, vapour, which, has, low, thermal, conductivity, insulates, the, surface, this, condition, of, a, vapour, film, insulating, the, surface, from, the, liquid, characterises, film, boiling, pool, boiling, refers, to, boiling, where, there, is, no, forced, convective, flow, instead, the, flow, occurs, due, to, density, gradients, it, can, experience, any, of, the, regimes, mentioned, above, flow, boiling, occurs, when, the, boiling, fluid, circulates, typically, through, pipes, its, movement, can, be, powered, by, pumps, such, as, in, power, plants, or, by, density, gradients, such, as, in, a, thermosiphon, or, a, heat, pipe, flows, in, flow, boiling, are, often, characterised, by, a, void, fraction, parameter, which, indicates, the, fraction, of, the, volume, in, the, system, that, is, vapor, one, can, use, this, fraction, and, the, densities, to, calculate, the, vapor, quality, which, refers, to, the, mass, fraction, that, is, in, the, gas, phase, flow, boiling, can, be, very, complex, with, heavy, influences, of, density, flow, rates, and, heat, flux, as, well, as, surface, tension, the, same, system, may, have, regions, that, are, liquid, gas, and, two, phase, flow, such, two, phase, regimes, can, lead, to, some, of, the, best, heat, transfer, coefficients, of, any, system, confined, boiling, refers, to, boiling, in, confined, geometries, typically, characterized, by, a, bond, number, that, compares, the, gap, spacing, to, the, capillary, length, confined, boiling, regimes, begin, to, play, a, major, role, when, bo, 0, 5, this, boiling, regime, is, dominated, by, vapour, stem, bubbles, left, behind, after, vapour, departs, these, bubbles, act, as, seeds, for, vapor, growth, confined, boiling, typically, has, higher, heat, transfer, coefficient, but, a, lower, chf, than, pool, boiling, chf, occurs, when, the, vapor, momentum, force, at, the, two, phase, interface, balances, the, combined, surface, tension, and, hydrostatic, forces, leading, to, irreversible, growth, of, the, dry, spot, confined, boiling, is, particularly, promising, for, electronics, cooling, the, boiling, point, of, an, element, at, a, given, pressure, is, a, characteristic, attribute, of, the, element, this, is, also, true, for, many, simple, compounds, including, water, and, simple, alcohols, once, boiling, has, started, and, provided, that, boiling, remains, stable, and, the, pressure, is, constant, the, temperature, of, the, boiling, liquid, remains, constant, this, attribute, led, to, the, adoption, of, boiling, points, as, the, definition, of, 100, c, mixtures, of, volatile, liquids, have, a, boiling, point, specific, to, that, mixture, producing, vapour, with, a, constant, mix, of, components, the, constant, boiling, mixture, this, attribute, allows, mixtures, of, liquids, to, be, separated, or, partly, separated, by, boiling, and, is, best, known, as, a, means, of, separating, ethanol, from, water, most, types, of, refrigeration, and, some, type, of, air, conditioning, work, by, compressing, a, gas, so, that, it, becomes, liquid, and, then, allowing, it, to, boil, this, adsorbs, heat, from, the, surroundings, cooling, the, fridge, or, freezer, or, cooling, the, air, entering, a, building, typical, liquids, include, propane, ammonia, carbon, dioxide, or, nitrogen, as, a, method, of, disinfecting, water, bringing, it, to, its, boiling, point, at, 100, c, 212, f, is, the, oldest, and, most, effective, way, since, it, does, not, affect, the, taste, it, is, effective, despite, contaminants, or, particles, present, in, it, and, is, a, single, step, process, which, eliminates, most, microbes, responsible, for, causing, intestine, related, diseases, the, boiling, point, of, water, is, 100, c, 212, f, at, sea, level, and, at, normal, barometric, pressure, in, places, having, a, proper, water, purification, system, it, is, recommended, only, as, an, emergency, treatment, method, or, for, obtaining, potable, water, in, the, wilderness, or, in, rural, areas, as, it, cannot, remove, chemical, toxins, or, impurities, the, elimination, of, micro, organisms, by, boiling, follows, first, order, kinetics, at, high, temperatures, it, is, achieved, in, less, time, and, at, lower, temperatures, in, more, time, the, heat, sensitivity, of, micro, organisms, varies, at, 70, c, 158, f, giardia, species, which, cause, giardiasis, can, take, ten, minutes, for, complete, inactivation, most, intestine, affecting, microbes, and, e, coli, gastroenteritis, take, less, than, a, minute, at, boiling, point, vibrio, cholerae, cholera, takes, ten, seconds, and, hepatitis, a, virus, causes, the, symptom, of, jaundice, one, minute, boiling, does, not, ensure, the, elimination, of, all, micro, organisms, the, bacterial, spores, clostridium, can, survive, at, 100, c, 212, f, but, are, not, water, borne, or, intestine, affecting, thus, for, human, health, complete, sterilization, of, water, is, not, required, the, traditional, advice, of, boiling, water, for, ten, minutes, is, mainly, for, additional, safety, since, microbes, start, getting, eliminated, at, temperatures, greater, than, 60, c, 140, f, and, bringing, it, to, its, boiling, point, is, also, a, useful, indication, that, can, be, seen, without, the, help, of, a, thermometer, and, by, this, time, the, water, is, disinfected, though, the, boiling, point, decreases, with, increasing, altitude, it, is, not, enough, to, affect, the, disinfecting, process, boiling, is, the, method, of, cooking, food, in, boiling, water, or, other, water, based, liquids, such, as, stock, or, milk, simmering, is, gentle, boiling, while, in, poaching, the, cooking, liquid, moves, but, scarcely, bubbles, the, boiling, point, of, water, is, typically, considered, to, be, 100, c, 212, f, 373, k, especially, at, sea, level, pressure, and, a, change, in, the, composition, of, the, liquid, may, alter, the, boiling, point, of, the, liquid, high, elevation, cooking, generally, takes, longer, since, boiling, point, is, a, function, of, atmospheric, pressure, at, an, elevation, of, about, one, mile, 1, 600, m, water, boils, at, approximately, 95, c, 203, f, 368, k, depending, on, the, type, of, food, and, the, elevation, the, boiling, water, may, not, be, hot, enough, to, cook, the, food, properly, similarly, increasing, the, pressure, as, in, a, pressure, cooker, raises, the, temperature, of, the, contents, above, the, open, air, boiling, point, also, known, as, boil, in, bag, this, involves, heating, or, cooking, ready, made, foods, sealed, in, a, thick, plastic, bag, the, bag, containing, the, food, often, frozen, is, submerged, in, boiling, water, for, a, prescribed, time, the, resulting, dishes, can, be, prepared, with, greater, convenience, as, no, pots, or, pans, are, dirtied, in, the, process, such, meals, are, available, for, camping, as, well, as, home, dining, at, any, given, temperature, the, molecules, in, a, liquid, have, varying, kinetic, energies, some, high, energy, particles, on, the, liquid, surface, may, have, enough, energy, to, escape, the, intermolecular, forces, of, attraction, of, the, liquid, and, become, a, gas, this, is, called, evaporation, evaporation, only, happens, on, the, surface, while, boiling, happens, throughout, the, liquid, when, a, liquid, reaches, its, boiling, point, bubbles, of, gas, form, in, it, which, rise, into, the, surface, and, burst, into, the, air, this, process, is, called, boiling, if, the, boiling, liquid, is, heated, more, strongly, the, temperature, does, not, rise, but, the, liquid, boils, more, quickly, this, distinction, is, exclusive, to, the, liquid, to, gas, transition, any, transition, directly, from, solid, to, gas, is, always, referred, to, as, sublimation, regardless, of, whether, it, is, at, its, boiling, point, or, not
