radium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, ra, and, atomic, number, 88, it, is, the, sixth, element, in, group, 2, of, the, periodic, table, also, known, as, the, alkaline, earth, metals, pure, radium, is, silvery, white, but, it, readily, reacts, with, nitrogen, rather, than, oxygen, upon, exposure, to, air, forming, a, black, surface, layer, of, radium, nitride, ra, 3, n, 2, all, isotopes, of, radium, are, radioactive, the, most, stable, isotope, being, radium, 226, with, a, half, life, of, 1, 600, years, when, radium, decays, it, emits, ionizing, radiation, as, a, by, product, which, can, excite, fluorescent, chemicals, and, cause, radioluminescence, of, the, radioactive, elements, that, occur, in, quantity, radium, is, considered, the, most, toxic, radium, in, the, form, of, radium, chloride, was, discovered, by, marie, and, pierre, curie, in, 1898, from, ore, mined, at, j, chymov, they, extracted, the, radium, compound, from, uraninite, and, published, the, discovery, at, the, french, academy, of, sciences, five, days, later, radium, was, isolated, in, its, metallic, state, by, marie, curie, and, andr, louis, debierne, through, the, electrolysis, of, radium, chloride, in, 1910, and, soon, afterwards, the, metal, started, being, produced, on, larger, scales, in, austria, the, united, states, and, belgium, however, the, amount, of, radium, produced, globally, has, always, been, small, in, comparison, to, other, elements, and, by, the, 2010s, annual, production, of, radium, mainly, via, extraction, from, spent, nuclear, fuel, was, less, than, 100, grams, in, nature, radium, is, found, in, uranium, ores, in, quantities, as, small, as, a, seventh, of, a, gram, per, ton, of, uraninite, and, in, thorium, ores, in, trace, amounts, radium, is, not, necessary, for, living, organisms, and, its, radioactivity, and, chemical, reactivity, make, adverse, health, effects, likely, when, it, is, incorporated, into, biochemical, processes, because, of, its, chemical, mimicry, of, calcium, as, of, 2018, other, than, in, nuclear, medicine, radium, has, no, commercial, applications, formerly, from, the, 1910s, to, the, 1970s, it, was, used, as, a, radioactive, source, for, radioluminescent, devices, and, also, in, radioactive, quackery, for, its, supposed, curative, power, in, nearly, all, of, its, applications, radium, has, been, replaced, with, less, dangerous, radioisotopes, with, one, of, its, few, remaining, non, medical, uses, being, the, production, of, actinium, in, nuclear, reactors, radium, is, the, heaviest, known, alkaline, earth, metal, and, is, the, only, radioactive, member, of, its, group, its, physical, and, chemical, properties, most, closely, resemble, its, lighter, congener, barium, pure, radium, is, a, volatile, silvery, white, metal, although, its, lighter, congeners, calcium, strontium, and, barium, have, a, slight, yellow, tint, this, tint, rapidly, vanishes, on, exposure, to, air, yielding, a, black, layer, of, what, is, probably, radium, nitride, ra, 3, n, 2, its, melting, point, is, either, 700, c, 1, 292, f, or, 960, c, 1, 760, f, and, its, boiling, point, is, 1, 737, c, 3, 159, f, however, this, is, not, well, established, both, of, these, values, are, slightly, lower, than, those, of, barium, confirming, periodic, trends, down, the, group, 2, elements, like, barium, and, the, alkali, metals, radium, crystallizes, in, the, body, centered, cubic, structure, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, the, radium, radium, bond, distance, is, 514, 8, picometers, radium, has, a, density, of, 5, 5, g, cm, 3, higher, than, that, of, barium, again, confirming, periodic, trends, the, radium, barium, density, ratio, is, comparable, to, the, radium, barium, atomic, mass, ratio, due, to, the, two, elements, similar, crystal, structures, radium, has, 33, known, isotopes, with, mass, numbers, from, 202, to, 234, all, of, which, are, radioactive, four, of, these, 223, ra, half, life, 11, 4, days, 224, ra, 3, 64, days, 226, ra, 1600, years, and, 228, ra, 5, 75, years, occur, naturally, in, the, decay, chains, of, primordial, thorium, 232, uranium, 235, and, uranium, 238, 223, ra, from, uranium, 235, 226, ra, from, uranium, 238, and, the, other, two, from, thorium, 232, these, isotopes, nevertheless, still, have, half, lives, too, short, to, be, primordial, radionuclides, and, only, exist, in, nature, from, these, decay, chains, together, with, the, mostly, artificial, 225, ra, 15, d, which, occurs, in, nature, only, as, a, decay, product, of, minute, traces, of, neptunium, 237, these, are, the, five, most, stable, isotopes, of, radium, all, other, 27, known, radium, isotopes, have, half, lives, under, two, hours, and, the, majority, have, half, lives, under, a, minute, of, these, 221, ra, half, life, 28, s, also, occurs, as, a, 237, np, daughter, and, 220, ra, and, 222, ra, would, be, produced, by, the, still, unobserved, double, beta, decay, of, natural, radon, isotopes, at, least, 12, nuclear, isomers, have, been, reported, the, most, stable, of, which, is, radium, 205m, with, a, half, life, between, 130, 230, milliseconds, this, is, still, shorter, than, twenty, four, ground, state, radium, isotopes, in, the, early, history, of, the, study, of, radioactivity, the, different, natural, isotopes, of, radium, were, given, different, names, as, it, was, not, until, frederick, soddy, s, scientific, career, in, the, early, 1900s, that, the, concept, of, isotopes, was, realized, in, this, scheme, 223, ra, was, named, actinium, x, acx, 224, ra, thorium, x, thx, 226, ra, radium, ra, and, 228, ra, mesothorium, 1, msth, 1, when, it, was, realized, that, all, of, these, are, isotopes, of, the, same, element, many, of, these, names, fell, out, of, use, and, radium, came, to, refer, to, all, isotopes, not, just, 226, ra, though, mesothorium, 1, in, particular, was, still, used, for, some, time, with, a, footnote, explaining, that, it, referred, to, 228, ra, some, of, radium, 226, s, decay, products, received, historical, names, including, radium, ranging, from, radium, a, to, radium, g, with, the, letter, indicating, approximately, how, far, they, were, down, the, chain, from, their, parent, 226, ra, radium, emanation, 222, rn, ra, a, 218, po, ra, b, 214, pb, ra, c, 214, bi, ra, c, 1, 214, po, ra, c, 2, 210, tl, ra, d, 210, pb, ra, e, 210, bi, ra, f, 210, po, and, ra, g, 206, pb, 226, ra, is, the, most, stable, isotope, of, radium, and, is, the, last, isotope, in, the, 4, n, 2, decay, chain, of, uranium, 238, with, a, half, life, of, over, a, millennium, it, makes, up, almost, all, of, natural, radium, its, immediate, decay, product, is, the, dense, radioactive, noble, gas, radon, specifically, the, isotope, 222, rn, which, is, responsible, for, much, of, the, danger, of, environmental, radium, it, is, 2, 7, million, times, more, radioactive, than, the, same, molar, amount, of, natural, uranium, mostly, uranium, 238, due, to, its, proportionally, shorter, half, life, a, sample, of, radium, metal, maintains, itself, at, a, higher, temperature, than, its, surroundings, because, of, the, radiation, it, emits, natural, radium, which, is, mostly, 226, ra, emits, mostly, alpha, particles, but, other, steps, in, its, decay, chain, the, uranium, or, radium, series, emit, alpha, or, beta, particles, and, almost, all, particle, emissions, are, accompanied, by, gamma, rays, experimental, nuclear, physics, studies, have, shown, that, nuclei, of, several, radium, isotopes, such, as, 222, ra, 224, ra, and, 226, ra, have, reflection, asymmetric, pear, like, shapes, in, particular, this, experimental, information, on, radium, 224, has, been, obtained, at, isolde, using, a, technique, called, coulomb, excitation, radium, like, barium, is, a, highly, reactive, metal, and, always, exhibits, its, group, oxidation, state, of, 2, it, forms, the, colorless, ra, 2, cation, in, aqueous, solution, which, is, highly, basic, and, does, not, form, complexes, readily, most, radium, compounds, are, therefore, simple, ionic, compounds, though, participation, from, the, 6s, and, 6p, electrons, in, addition, to, the, valence, 7s, electrons, is, expected, due, to, relativistic, effects, and, would, enhance, the, covalent, character, of, radium, compounds, such, as, raf, 2, and, ra, at, 2, for, this, reason, the, standard, electrode, potential, for, the, half, reaction, ra, 2, aq, 2e, ra, s, is, 2, 916, v, even, slightly, lower, than, the, value, 2, 92, v, for, barium, whereas, the, values, had, previously, smoothly, increased, down, the, group, ca, 2, 84, v, sr, 2, 89, v, ba, 2, 92, v, the, values, for, barium, and, radium, are, almost, exactly, the, same, as, those, of, the, heavier, alkali, metals, potassium, rubidium, and, caesium, solid, radium, compounds, are, white, as, radium, ions, provide, no, specific, coloring, but, they, gradually, turn, yellow, and, then, dark, over, time, due, to, self, radiolysis, from, radium, s, alpha, decay, insoluble, radium, compounds, coprecipitate, with, all, barium, most, strontium, and, most, lead, compounds, radium, oxide, rao, has, not, been, characterized, well, past, its, existence, despite, oxides, being, common, compounds, for, the, other, alkaline, earth, metals, radium, hydroxide, ra, oh, 2, is, the, most, readily, soluble, among, the, alkaline, earth, hydroxides, and, is, a, stronger, base, than, its, barium, congener, barium, hydroxide, it, is, also, more, soluble, than, actinium, hydroxide, and, thorium, hydroxide, these, three, adjacent, hydroxides, may, be, separated, by, precipitating, them, with, ammonia, radium, chloride, racl, 2, is, a, colorless, luminous, compound, it, becomes, yellow, after, some, time, due, to, self, damage, by, the, alpha, radiation, given, off, by, radium, when, it, decays, small, amounts, of, barium, impurities, give, the, compound, a, rose, color, it, is, soluble, in, water, though, less, so, than, barium, chloride, and, its, solubility, decreases, with, increasing, concentration, of, hydrochloric, acid, crystallization, from, aqueous, solution, gives, the, dihydrate, racl, 2, 2h, 2, o, isomorphous, with, its, barium, analog, radium, bromide, rabr, 2, is, also, a, colorless, luminous, compound, in, water, it, is, more, soluble, than, radium, chloride, like, radium, chloride, crystallization, from, aqueous, solution, gives, the, dihydrate, rabr, 2, 2h, 2, o, isomorphous, with, its, barium, analog, the, ionizing, radiation, emitted, by, radium, bromide, excites, nitrogen, molecules, in, the, air, making, it, glow, the, alpha, particles, emitted, by, radium, quickly, gain, two, electrons, to, become, neutral, helium, which, builds, up, inside, and, weakens, radium, bromide, crystals, this, effect, sometimes, causes, the, crystals, to, break, or, even, explode, radium, nitrate, ra, no, 3, 2, is, a, white, compound, that, can, be, made, by, dissolving, radium, carbonate, in, nitric, acid, as, the, concentration, of, nitric, acid, increases, the, solubility, of, radium, nitrate, decreases, an, important, property, for, the, chemical, purification, of, radium, radium, forms, much, the, same, insoluble, salts, as, its, lighter, congener, barium, it, forms, the, insoluble, sulfate, raso, 4, the, most, insoluble, known, sulfate, chromate, racro, 4, carbonate, raco, 3, iodate, ra, io, 3, 2, tetrafluoroberyllate, rabef, 4, and, nitrate, ra, no, 3, 2, with, the, exception, of, the, carbonate, all, of, these, are, less, soluble, in, water, than, the, corresponding, barium, salts, but, they, are, all, isostructural, to, their, barium, counterparts, additionally, radium, phosphate, oxalate, and, sulfite, are, probably, also, insoluble, as, they, coprecipitate, with, the, corresponding, insoluble, barium, salts, the, great, insolubility, of, radium, sulfate, at, 20, c, only, 2, 1, mg, will, dissolve, in, 1, kg, of, water, means, that, it, is, one, of, the, less, biologically, dangerous, radium, compounds, the, large, ionic, radius, of, ra, 2, 148, pm, results, in, weak, complexation, and, poor, extraction, of, radium, from, aqueous, solutions, when, not, at, high, ph, all, isotopes, of, radium, have, half, lives, much, shorter, than, the, age, of, the, earth, so, that, any, primordial, radium, would, have, decayed, long, ago, radium, nevertheless, still, occurs, in, the, environment, as, the, isotopes, 223, ra, 224, ra, 226, ra, and, 228, ra, are, part, of, the, decay, chains, of, natural, thorium, and, uranium, isotopes, since, thorium, and, uranium, have, very, long, half, lives, these, daughters, are, continually, being, regenerated, by, their, decay, of, these, four, isotopes, the, longest, lived, is, 226, ra, half, life, 1600, years, a, decay, product, of, natural, uranium, because, of, its, relative, longevity, 226, ra, is, the, most, common, isotope, of, the, element, making, up, about, one, part, per, trillion, of, the, earth, s, crust, essentially, all, natural, radium, is, 226, ra, thus, radium, is, found, in, tiny, quantities, in, the, uranium, ore, uraninite, and, various, other, uranium, minerals, and, in, even, tinier, quantities, in, thorium, minerals, one, ton, of, pitchblende, typically, yields, about, one, seventh, of, a, gram, of, radium, one, kilogram, of, the, earth, s, crust, contains, about, 900, picograms, of, radium, and, one, liter, of, sea, water, contains, about, 89, femtograms, of, radium, radium, was, discovered, by, marie, sk, odowska, curie, and, her, husband, pierre, curie, on, 21, december, 1898, in, a, uraninite, pitchblende, sample, from, j, chymov, while, studying, the, mineral, earlier, the, curies, removed, uranium, from, it, and, found, that, the, remaining, material, was, still, radioactive, in, july, 1898, while, studying, pitchblende, they, isolated, an, element, similar, to, bismuth, which, turned, out, to, be, polonium, they, then, isolated, a, radioactive, mixture, consisting, of, two, components, compounds, of, barium, which, gave, a, brilliant, green, flame, color, and, unknown, radioactive, compounds, which, gave, carmine, spectral, lines, that, had, never, been, documented, before, the, curies, found, the, radioactive, compounds, to, be, very, similar, to, the, barium, compounds, except, they, were, less, soluble, this, discovery, made, it, possible, for, the, curies, to, isolate, the, radioactive, compounds, and, discover, a, new, element, in, them, the, curies, announced, their, discovery, to, the, french, academy, of, sciences, on, 26, december, 1898, the, naming, of, radium, dates, to, about, 1899, from, the, french, word, radium, formed, in, modern, latin, from, radius, ray, this, was, in, recognition, of, radium, s, emission, of, energy, in, the, form, of, rays, the, gaseous, emissions, of, radium, radon, were, recognized, and, studied, extensively, by, friedrich, ernst, dorn, in, the, early, 1900s, though, at, the, time, they, were, characterized, as, radium, emanations, in, september, 1910, marie, curie, and, andr, louis, debierne, announced, that, they, had, isolated, radium, as, a, pure, metal, through, the, electrolysis, of, pure, radium, chloride, racl, 2, solution, using, a, mercury, cathode, producing, radium, mercury, amalgam, this, amalgam, was, then, heated, in, an, atmosphere, of, hydrogen, gas, to, remove, the, mercury, leaving, pure, radium, metal, later, that, same, year, e, eoler, isolated, radium, by, thermal, decomposition, of, its, azide, ra, n, 3, 2, radium, metal, was, first, industrially, produced, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, by, biraco, a, subsidiary, company, of, union, mini, re, du, haut, katanga, umhk, in, its, olen, plant, in, belgium, the, metal, became, an, important, export, of, belgium, from, 1922, up, until, world, war, ii, the, general, historical, unit, for, radioactivity, the, curie, is, based, on, the, radioactivity, of, 226, ra, it, was, originally, defined, as, the, radioactivity, of, one, gram, of, radium, 226, but, the, definition, was, later, refined, to, be, 3, 7, 10, 10, disintegrations, per, second, radium, was, formerly, used, in, self, luminous, paints, for, watches, nuclear, panels, aircraft, switches, clocks, and, instrument, dials, a, typical, self, luminous, watch, that, uses, radium, paint, contains, around, 1, microgram, of, radium, in, the, mid, 1920s, a, lawsuit, was, filed, against, the, united, states, radium, corporation, by, five, dying, radium, girls, dial, painters, who, had, painted, radium, based, luminous, paint, on, the, dials, of, watches, and, clocks, the, dial, painters, were, instructed, to, lick, their, brushes, to, give, them, a, fine, point, thereby, ingesting, radium, their, exposure, to, radium, caused, serious, health, effects, which, included, sores, anemia, and, bone, cancer, during, the, litigation, it, was, determined, that, the, company, s, scientists, and, management, had, taken, considerable, precautions, to, protect, themselves, from, the, effects, of, radiation, but, it, did, not, seem, to, protect, their, employees, additionally, for, several, years, the, companies, had, attempted, to, cover, up, the, effects, and, avoid, liability, by, insisting, that, the, radium, girls, were, instead, suffering, from, syphilis, as, a, result, of, the, lawsuit, and, an, extensive, study, by, the, u, s, public, health, service, the, adverse, effects, of, radioactivity, became, widely, known, and, radium, dial, painters, were, instructed, in, proper, safety, precautions, and, provided, with, protective, gear, in, particular, dial, painters, no, longer, licked, paint, brushes, to, shape, them, which, caused, some, ingestion, of, radium, salts, radium, was, still, used, in, dials, as, late, as, the, 1960s, but, there, were, no, further, injuries, to, dial, painters, from, the, 1960s, the, use, of, radium, paint, was, discontinued, in, many, cases, luminous, dials, were, implemented, with, non, radioactive, fluorescent, materials, excited, by, light, such, devices, glow, in, the, dark, after, exposure, to, light, but, the, glow, fades, where, long, lasting, self, luminosity, in, darkness, was, required, safer, radioactive, promethium, 147, half, life, 2, 6, years, or, tritium, half, life, 12, years, paint, was, used, both, continue, to, be, used, as, of, 2018, these, had, the, added, advantage, of, not, degrading, the, phosphor, over, time, unlike, radium, tritium, as, it, is, used, in, these, applications, is, considered, safer, than, radium, as, it, emits, very, low, energy, beta, radiation, even, lower, energy, than, the, beta, radiation, emitted, by, promethium, which, cannot, penetrate, the, skin, unlike, the, gamma, radiation, emitted, by, radium, isotopes, clocks, watches, and, instruments, dating, from, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, often, in, military, applications, may, have, been, painted, with, radioactive, luminous, paint, they, are, usually, no, longer, luminous, however, this, is, not, due, to, radioactive, decay, of, the, radium, which, has, a, half, life, of, 1600, years, but, to, the, fluorescence, of, the, zinc, sulfide, fluorescent, medium, being, worn, out, by, the, radiation, from, the, radium, the, appearance, of, an, often, thick, layer, of, green, or, yellowish, brown, paint, in, devices, from, this, period, suggests, a, radioactive, hazard, the, radiation, dose, from, an, intact, device, is, relatively, low, and, usually, not, an, acute, risk, but, the, paint, is, dangerous, if, released, and, inhaled, or, ingested, radium, was, once, an, additive, in, products, such, as, toothpaste, hair, creams, and, even, food, items, due, to, its, supposed, curative, powers, such, products, soon, fell, out, of, vogue, and, were, prohibited, by, authorities, in, many, countries, after, it, was, discovered, they, could, have, serious, adverse, health, effects, see, for, instance, radithor, or, revigator, types, of, radium, water, or, standard, radium, solution, for, drinking, spas, featuring, radium, rich, water, are, still, occasionally, touted, as, beneficial, such, as, those, in, misasa, tottori, japan, though, the, sources, of, radioactivity, in, these, spas, vary, and, may, be, attributed, to, radon, and, other, radioisotopes, in, the, u, s, nasal, radium, irradiation, was, also, administered, to, children, to, prevent, middle, ear, problems, or, enlarged, tonsils, from, the, late, 1940s, through, the, early, 1970s, radium, usually, in, the, form, of, radium, chloride, or, radium, bromide, was, used, in, medicine, to, produce, radon, gas, which, in, turn, was, used, as, a, cancer, treatment, for, example, several, of, these, radon, sources, were, used, in, canada, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, however, many, treatments, that, were, used, in, the, early, 1900s, are, not, used, anymore, because, of, the, harmful, effects, radium, bromide, exposure, caused, some, examples, of, these, effects, are, anaemia, cancer, and, genetic, mutations, as, of, 2011, safer, gamma, emitters, such, as, 60, co, which, is, less, costly, and, available, in, larger, quantities, were, usually, used, to, replace, the, historical, use, of, radium, in, this, application, but, factors, including, increasing, costs, of, cobalt, and, risks, of, keeping, radioactive, sources, on, site, have, led, to, an, increase, in, the, use, of, linear, particle, accelerators, for, the, same, applications, early, in, the, 1900s, biologists, used, radium, to, induce, mutations, and, study, genetics, as, early, as, 1904, daniel, macdougal, used, radium, in, an, attempt, to, determine, whether, it, could, provoke, sudden, large, mutations, and, cause, major, evolutionary, shifts, thomas, hunt, morgan, used, radium, to, induce, changes, resulting, in, white, eyed, fruit, flies, nobel, winning, biologist, hermann, muller, briefly, studied, the, effects, of, radium, on, fruit, fly, mutations, before, turning, to, more, affordable, x, ray, experiments, howard, atwood, kelly, one, of, the, founding, physicians, of, johns, hopkins, hospital, was, a, major, pioneer, in, the, medical, use, of, radium, to, treat, cancer, his, first, patient, was, his, own, aunt, in, 1904, who, died, shortly, after, surgery, kelly, was, known, to, use, excessive, amounts, of, radium, to, treat, various, cancers, and, tumors, as, a, result, some, of, his, patients, died, from, radium, exposure, his, method, of, radium, application, was, inserting, a, radium, capsule, near, the, affected, area, then, sewing, the, radium, points, directly, to, the, tumor, this, was, the, same, method, used, to, treat, henrietta, lacks, the, host, of, the, original, hela, cells, for, cervical, cancer, as, of, 2015, safer, and, more, available, radioisotopes, are, used, instead, uranium, had, no, large, scale, application, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, therefore, no, large, uranium, mines, existed, in, the, beginning, the, only, large, source, for, uranium, ore, was, the, silver, mines, in, j, chymov, austria, hungary, now, czech, republic, the, uranium, ore, was, only, a, byproduct, of, the, mining, activities, in, the, first, extraction, of, radium, curie, used, the, residues, after, extraction, of, uranium, from, pitchblende, the, uranium, had, been, extracted, by, dissolution, in, sulfuric, acid, leaving, radium, sulfate, which, is, similar, to, barium, sulfate, but, even, less, soluble, in, the, residues, the, residues, also, contained, rather, substantial, amounts, of, barium, sulfate, which, thus, acted, as, a, carrier, for, the, radium, sulfate, the, first, steps, of, the, radium, extraction, process, involved, boiling, with, sodium, hydroxide, followed, by, hydrochloric, acid, treatment, to, minimize, impurities, of, other, compounds, the, remaining, residue, was, then, treated, with, sodium, carbonate, to, convert, the, barium, sulfate, into, barium, carbonate, carrying, the, radium, thus, making, it, soluble, in, hydrochloric, acid, after, dissolution, the, barium, and, radium, were, reprecipitated, as, sulfates, this, was, then, repeated, to, further, purify, the, mixed, sulfate, some, impurities, that, form, insoluble, sulfides, were, removed, by, treating, the, chloride, solution, with, hydrogen, sulfide, followed, by, filtering, when, the, mixed, sulfates, were, pure, enough, they, were, once, more, converted, to, mixed, chlorides, barium, and, radium, thereafter, were, separated, by, fractional, crystallisation, while, monitoring, the, progress, using, a, spectroscope, radium, gives, characteristic, red, lines, in, contrast, to, the, green, barium, lines, and, the, electroscope, after, the, isolation, of, radium, by, marie, and, pierre, curie, from, uranium, ore, from, j, chymov, several, scientists, started, to, isolate, radium, in, small, quantities, later, small, companies, purchased, mine, tailings, from, j, chymov, mines, and, started, isolating, radium, in, 1904, the, austrian, government, nationalised, the, mines, and, stopped, exporting, raw, ore, until, 1912, when, radium, production, increased, radium, availability, was, low, the, formation, of, an, austrian, monopoly, and, the, strong, urge, of, other, countries, to, have, access, to, radium, led, to, a, worldwide, search, for, uranium, ores, the, united, states, took, over, as, leading, producer, in, the, early, 1910s, the, carnotite, sands, in, colorado, provide, some, of, the, element, but, richer, ores, are, found, in, the, congo, and, the, area, of, the, great, bear, lake, and, the, great, slave, lake, of, northwestern, canada, neither, of, the, deposits, is, mined, for, radium, but, the, uranium, content, makes, mining, profitable, the, curies, process, was, still, used, for, industrial, radium, extraction, in, 1940, but, mixed, bromides, were, then, used, for, the, fractionation, if, the, barium, content, of, the, uranium, ore, is, not, high, enough, it, is, easy, to, add, some, to, carry, the, radium, these, processes, were, applied, to, high, grade, uranium, ores, but, may, not, work, well, with, low, grade, ores, small, amounts, of, radium, were, still, extracted, from, uranium, ore, by, this, method, of, mixed, precipitation, and, ion, exchange, as, late, as, the, 1990s, but, as, of, 2011, it, is, extracted, only, from, spent, nuclear, fuel, in, 1954, the, total, worldwide, supply, of, purified, radium, amounted, to, about, 5, pounds, 2, 3, kg, the, chief, radium, producing, countries, are, belgium, canada, the, czech, republic, slovakia, the, united, kingdom, and, russia, zaire, and, canada, were, briefly, the, largest, producers, of, radium, in, the, late, 1970s, the, amounts, of, radium, produced, were, and, are, always, relatively, small, for, example, in, 1918, 13, 6, g, of, radium, were, produced, in, the, united, states, and, 70, g, total, were, produced, from, 1913, to, 1920, in, pittsburgh, the, annual, production, of, pure, radium, compounds, was, only, about, 100, g, in, total, as, of, 1984, annual, production, of, radium, had, reduced, to, less, than, 100, g, by, 2018, the, metal, is, isolated, by, reducing, radium, oxide, with, aluminium, metal, in, a, vacuum, at, 1, 200, c, radium, is, seeing, increasing, use, in, the, field, of, atomic, molecular, and, optical, physics, symmetry, breaking, forces, scale, proportional, to, z, 3, displaystyle, z, 3, which, makes, radium, the, heaviest, alkaline, earth, element, well, suited, for, constraining, new, physics, beyond, the, standard, model, some, radium, isotopes, such, as, radium, 225, have, octupole, deformed, parity, doublets, that, enhance, sensitivity, to, charge, parity, violating, new, physics, by, two, to, three, orders, of, magnitude, compared, to, 199, hg, radium, is, also, a, promising, candidate, for, trapped, ion, optical, clocks, the, radium, ion, has, two, subhertz, linewidth, transitions, from, the, 7, s, 2, s, 1, 2, displaystyle, mathrm, 7s, 2, s, 1, 2, ground, state, that, could, serve, as, the, clock, transition, in, an, optical, clock, a, 226, ra, trapped, ion, atomic, clock, has, been, demonstrated, on, the, 7, s, 2, s, 1, 2, displaystyle, mathrm, 7s, 2, s, 1, 2, to, 6, d, 2, d, 5, 2, displaystyle, mathrm, 6d, 2, d, 5, 2, transition, which, has, been, considered, for, the, creation, of, a, transportable, optical, clock, as, all, transitions, necessary, for, clock, operation, can, be, addressed, with, direct, diode, lasers, at, common, wavelengths, some, of, the, few, practical, uses, of, radium, are, derived, from, its, radioactive, properties, more, recently, discovered, radioisotopes, such, as, cobalt, 60, and, caesium, 137, are, replacing, radium, in, even, these, limited, uses, because, several, of, these, isotopes, are, more, powerful, emitters, safer, to, handle, and, available, in, more, concentrated, form, the, isotope, 223, ra, was, approved, by, the, united, states, food, and, drug, administration, in, 2013, for, use, in, medicine, as, a, cancer, treatment, of, bone, metastasis, in, the, form, of, a, solution, including, radium, 223, chloride, the, main, indication, of, treatment, is, the, therapy, of, bony, metastases, from, castration, resistant, prostate, cancer, 225, ra, has, also, been, used, in, experiments, concerning, therapeutic, irradiation, as, it, is, the, only, reasonably, long, lived, radium, isotope, which, does, not, have, radon, as, one, of, its, daughters, radium, was, still, used, in, 2007, as, a, radiation, source, in, some, industrial, radiography, devices, to, check, for, flawed, metallic, parts, similarly, to, x, ray, imaging, when, mixed, with, beryllium, radium, acts, as, a, neutron, source, up, until, at, least, 2004, radium, beryllium, neutron, sources, were, still, sometimes, used, but, other, materials, such, as, polonium, and, americium, have, become, more, common, for, use, in, neutron, sources, rabef, 4, based, n, neutron, sources, have, been, deprecated, despite, the, high, number, of, neutrons, they, emit, 1, 84, 10, 6, neutrons, per, second, in, favour, of, 241, am, be, sources, as, of, 2011, the, isotope, 226, ra, is, mainly, used, to, form, 227, ac, by, neutron, irradiation, in, a, nuclear, reactor, radium, is, highly, radioactive, as, is, its, immediate, decay, product, radon, gas, when, ingested, 80, of, the, ingested, radium, leaves, the, body, through, the, feces, while, the, other, 20, goes, into, the, bloodstream, mostly, accumulating, in, the, bones, this, is, because, the, body, treats, radium, as, calcium, and, deposits, it, in, the, bones, where, radioactivity, degrades, marrow, and, can, mutate, bone, cells, exposure, to, radium, internal, or, external, can, cause, cancer, and, other, disorders, because, radium, and, radon, emit, alpha, and, gamma, rays, upon, their, decay, which, kill, and, mutate, cells, at, the, time, of, the, manhattan, project, in, the, 1940s, the, tolerance, level, for, workers, was, set, at, 0, 1, micrograms, of, ingested, radium, some, of, the, biological, effects, of, radium, include, the, first, case, of, radium, dermatitis, reported, in, 1900, two, years, after, the, element, s, discovery, the, french, physicist, antoine, becquerel, carried, a, small, ampoule, of, radium, in, his, waistcoat, pocket, for, six, hours, and, reported, that, his, skin, became, ulcerated, pierre, curie, attached, a, tube, filled, with, radium, to, his, arm, for, ten, hours, which, resulted, in, the, appearance, of, a, skin, lesion, suggesting, the, use, of, radium, to, attack, cancerous, tissue, as, it, had, attacked, healthy, tissue, handling, of, radium, has, been, blamed, for, marie, curie, s, death, due, to, aplastic, anemia, a, significant, amount, of, radium, s, danger, comes, from, its, daughter, radon, which, as, a, gas, can, enter, the, body, far, more, readily, than, can, its, parent, radium, as, of, 2015, 226, ra, is, considered, to, be, the, most, toxic, of, the, quantity, radioelements, and, it, must, be, handled, in, tight, glove, boxes, with, significant, airstream, circulation, that, is, then, treated, to, avoid, escape, of, its, daughter, 222, rn, to, the, environment, old, ampoules, containing, radium, solutions, must, be, opened, with, care, because, radiolytic, decomposition, of, water, can, produce, an, overpressure, of, hydrogen, and, oxygen, gas, the, world, s, largest, concentration, of, 226, ra, is, stored, within, the, interim, waste, containment, structure, approximately, 9, 6, mi, 15, 4, km, north, of, niagara, falls, new, york, in, the, united, states, the, environmental, protection, agency, defined, maximum, contaminant, level, for, radium, is, 5, pci, l, for, drinking, water, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, does, not, specifically, set, exposure, limits, for, radium, and, instead, limits, ionizing, radiation, exposure, in, units, of, roentgen, equivalent, man, based, on, the, exposed, area, of, the, body, radioactive, material, exposure, is, regulated, more, closely, by, the, nuclear, regulatory, commission, which, sets, the, exposure, limit, to, 226, ra, at, 0, 01, ci, outside, of, the, united, states, exposure, to, radium,
