material, comprising, more, than, one, phase, where, at, least, one, of, the, phases, consists, of, finely, divided, phase, domains, often, in, the, colloidal, size, range, dispersed, throughout, a, continuous, phase, note, 1, modification, of, definition, in, ref, a, dispersion, is, a, system, in, which, distributed, particles, of, one, material, are, dispersed, in, a, continuous, phase, of, another, material, the, two, phases, may, be, in, the, same, or, different, states, of, matter, dispersions, are, classified, in, a, number, of, different, ways, including, how, large, the, particles, are, in, relation, to, the, particles, of, the, continuous, phase, whether, or, not, precipitation, occurs, and, the, presence, of, brownian, motion, in, general, dispersions, of, particles, sufficiently, large, for, sedimentation, are, called, suspensions, while, those, of, smaller, particles, are, called, colloids, and, solutions, dispersions, do, not, display, any, structure, i, e, the, particles, or, in, case, of, emulsions, droplets, dispersed, in, the, liquid, or, solid, matrix, the, dispersion, medium, are, assumed, to, be, statistically, distributed, therefore, for, dispersions, usually, percolation, theory, is, assumed, to, appropriately, describe, their, properties, however, percolation, theory, can, be, applied, only, if, the, system, it, should, describe, is, in, or, close, to, thermodynamic, equilibrium, there, are, only, very, few, studies, about, the, structure, of, dispersions, emulsions, although, they, are, plentiful, in, type, and, in, use, all, over, the, world, in, innumerable, applications, see, below, in, the, following, only, such, dispersions, with, a, dispersed, phase, diameter, of, less, than, 1, m, will, be, discussed, to, understand, the, formation, and, properties, of, such, dispersions, incl, emulsions, it, must, be, considered, that, the, dispersed, phase, exhibits, a, surface, which, is, covered, wet, by, a, different, surface, that, hence, are, forming, an, interface, chemistry, both, surfaces, have, to, be, created, which, requires, a, huge, amount, of, energy, and, the, interfacial, tension, difference, of, surface, tension, is, not, compensating, the, energy, input, if, at, all, experimental, evidence, suggests, dispersions, have, a, structure, very, much, different, from, any, kind, of, statistical, distribution, which, would, be, characteristics, for, a, system, in, thermodynamic, equilibrium, but, in, contrast, display, structures, similar, to, self, organisation, which, can, be, described, by, non, equilibrium, thermodynamics, this, is, the, reason, why, some, liquid, dispersions, turn, to, become, gels, or, even, solid, at, a, concentration, of, a, dispersed, phase, above, a, critical, concentration, which, is, dependent, on, particle, size, and, interfacial, tension, also, the, sudden, appearance, of, conductivity, in, a, system, of, a, dispersed, conductive, phase, in, an, insulating, matrix, has, been, explained, dispersion, is, a, process, by, which, in, the, case, of, solid, dispersing, in, a, liquid, agglomerated, particles, are, separated, from, each, other, and, a, new, interface, between, the, inner, surface, of, the, liquid, dispersion, medium, and, the, surface, of, the, dispersed, particles, is, generated, this, process, is, facilitated, by, molecular, diffusion, and, convection, with, respect, to, molecular, diffusion, dispersion, occurs, as, a, result, of, an, unequal, concentration, of, the, introduced, material, throughout, the, bulk, medium, when, the, dispersed, material, is, first, introduced, into, the, bulk, medium, the, region, at, which, it, is, introduced, then, has, a, higher, concentration, of, that, material, than, any, other, point, in, the, bulk, this, unequal, distribution, results, in, a, concentration, gradient, that, drives, the, dispersion, of, particles, in, the, medium, so, that, the, concentration, is, constant, across, the, entire, bulk, with, respect, to, convection, variations, in, velocity, between, flow, paths, in, the, bulk, facilitate, the, distribution, of, the, dispersed, material, into, the, medium, although, both, transport, phenomena, contribute, to, the, dispersion, of, a, material, into, the, bulk, the, mechanism, of, dispersion, is, primarily, driven, by, convection, in, cases, where, there, is, significant, turbulent, flow, in, the, bulk, diffusion, is, the, dominant, mechanism, in, the, process, of, dispersion, in, cases, of, little, to, no, turbulence, in, the, bulk, where, molecular, diffusion, is, able, to, facilitate, dispersion, over, a, long, period, of, time, these, phenomena, are, reflected, in, common, real, world, events, the, molecules, in, a, drop, of, food, coloring, added, to, water, will, eventually, disperse, throughout, the, entire, medium, where, the, effects, of, molecular, diffusion, are, more, evident, however, stirring, the, mixture, with, a, spoon, will, create, turbulent, flows, in, the, water, that, accelerate, the, process, of, dispersion, through, convection, dominated, dispersion, the, term, dispersion, also, refers, to, the, physical, property, of, the, degree, to, which, particles, clump, together, into, agglomerates, or, aggregates, while, the, two, terms, are, often, used, interchangeably, according, to, iso, nanotechnology, definitions, an, agglomerate, is, a, reversible, collection, of, particles, weakly, bound, for, example, by, van, der, waals, forces, or, physical, entanglement, whereas, an, aggregate, is, composed, of, irreversibly, bonded, or, fused, particles, for, example, through, covalent, bonds, a, full, quantification, of, dispersion, would, involve, the, size, shape, and, number, of, particles, in, each, agglomerate, or, aggregate, the, strength, of, the, interparticle, forces, their, overall, structure, and, their, distribution, within, the, system, however, the, complexity, is, usually, reduced, by, comparing, the, measured, size, distribution, of, primary, particles, to, that, of, the, agglomerates, or, aggregates, when, discussing, suspensions, of, solid, particles, in, liquid, media, the, zeta, potential, is, most, often, used, to, quantify, the, degree, of, dispersion, with, suspensions, possessing, a, high, absolute, value, of, zeta, potential, being, considered, as, well, dispersed, a, solution, describes, a, homogeneous, mixture, where, the, dispersed, particles, will, not, settle, if, the, solution, is, left, undisturbed, for, a, prolonged, period, of, time, a, colloid, is, a, heterogeneous, mixture, where, the, dispersed, particles, have, at, least, in, one, direction, a, dimension, roughly, between, 1, nm, and, 1, m, or, that, in, a, system, discontinuities, are, found, at, distances, of, that, order, a, suspension, is, a, heterogeneous, dispersion, of, larger, particles, in, a, medium, unlike, solutions, and, colloids, if, left, undisturbed, for, a, prolonged, period, of, time, the, suspended, particles, will, settle, out, of, the, mixture, although, suspensions, are, relatively, simple, to, distinguish, from, solutions, and, colloids, it, may, be, difficult, to, distinguish, solutions, from, colloids, since, the, particles, dispersed, in, the, medium, may, be, too, small, to, distinguish, by, the, human, eye, instead, the, tyndall, effect, is, used, to, distinguish, solutions, and, colloids, due, to, the, various, reported, definitions, of, solutions, colloids, and, suspensions, provided, in, the, literature, it, is, difficult, to, label, each, classification, with, a, specific, particle, size, range, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, attempts, to, provide, a, standard, nomenclature, for, colloids, as, particles, in, a, size, range, having, a, dimension, roughly, between, 1, nm, and, 1, m, in, addition, to, the, classification, by, particle, size, dispersions, can, also, be, labeled, by, the, combination, of, the, dispersed, phase, and, the, medium, phase, that, the, particles, are, suspended, in, aerosols, are, liquids, dispersed, in, a, gas, sols, are, solids, in, liquids, emulsions, are, liquids, dispersed, in, liquids, more, specifically, a, dispersion, of, two, immiscible, liquids, and, gels, are, liquids, dispersed, in, solids, milk, is, a, commonly, cited, example, of, an, emulsion, a, specific, type, of, dispersion, of, one, liquid, into, another, liquid, where, the, two, liquids, are, immiscible, the, fat, molecules, suspended, in, milk, provide, a, mode, of, delivery, of, important, fat, soluble, vitamins, and, nutrients, from, the, mother, to, newborn, the, mechanical, thermal, or, enzymatic, treatment, of, milk, manipulates, the, integrity, of, these, fat, globules, and, results, in, a, wide, variety, of, dairy, products, oxide, dispersion, strengthened, alloy, ods, is, an, example, of, oxide, particle, dispersion, into, a, metal, medium, which, improves, the, high, temperature, tolerance, of, the, material, therefore, these, alloys, have, several, applications, in, the, nuclear, energy, industry, where, materials, must, withstand, extremely, high, temperatures, to, maintain, operation, the, degradation, of, coastal, aquifers, is, a, direct, result, of, seawater, intrusion, into, the, and, dispersion, into, the, aquifer, following, excessive, use, of, the, aquifer, when, an, aquifer, is, depleted, for, human, use, it, is, naturally, replenished, by, groundwater, moving, in, from, other, areas, in, the, case, of, coastal, aquifers, the, water, supply, is, replenished, both, from, the, land, boundary, on, one, side, and, the, sea, boundary, on, the, other, side, after, excessive, discharge, saline, water, from, the, sea, boundary, will, enter, the, aquifer, and, disperse, in, the, freshwater, medium, threatening, the, viability, of, the, aquifer, for, human, use, several, different, solutions, to, seawater, intrusion, in, coastal, aquifers, have, been, proposed, including, engineering, methods, of, artificial, recharge, and, implementing, physical, barriers, at, the, sea, boundary, chemical, dispersants, are, used, in, oil, spills, to, mitigate, the, effects, of, the, spill, and, promote, the, degradation, of, oil, particles, the, dispersants, effectively, isolate, pools, on, oil, sitting, on, the, surface, of, the, water, into, smaller, droplets, that, disperse, into, the, water, which, lowers, the, overall, concentration, of, oil, in, the, water, to, prevent, any, further, contamination, or, impact, on, marine, biology, and, coastal, wildlife
