the, cambrian, k, m, b, r, i, n, k, e, m, kam, bree, n, kaym, is, the, first, geological, period, of, the, paleozoic, era, and, the, phanerozoic, eon, the, cambrian, lasted, 53, 4, million, years, from, the, end, of, the, preceding, ediacaran, period, 538, 8, ma, million, years, ago, to, the, beginning, of, the, ordovician, period, 485, 4, ma, most, of, the, continents, lay, in, the, southern, hemisphere, surrounded, by, the, vast, panthalassa, ocean, the, assembly, of, gondwana, during, the, ediacaran, and, early, cambrian, led, to, the, development, of, new, convergent, plate, boundaries, and, continental, margin, arc, magmatism, along, its, margins, that, helped, drive, up, global, temperatures, laurentia, lay, across, the, equator, separated, from, gondwana, by, the, opening, iapetus, ocean, the, cambrian, was, a, time, of, greenhouse, climate, conditions, with, high, levels, of, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, and, low, levels, of, oxygen, in, the, atmosphere, and, seas, upwellings, of, anoxic, deep, ocean, waters, into, shallow, marine, environments, lead, to, extinction, events, whilst, periods, of, raised, oxygenation, led, to, increased, biodiversity, the, cambrian, marked, a, profound, change, in, life, on, earth, prior, to, the, period, the, majority, of, living, organisms, were, small, unicellular, and, poorly, preserved, complex, multicellular, organisms, gradually, became, more, common, during, the, ediacaran, but, it, was, not, until, the, cambrian, that, organisms, with, mineralised, shells, and, skeletons, are, found, in, the, rock, record, and, the, rapid, diversification, of, lifeforms, known, as, the, cambrian, explosion, produced, the, first, representatives, of, most, modern, animal, phyla, the, period, is, also, unique, in, its, unusually, high, proportion, of, lagerst, tte, deposits, sites, of, exceptional, preservation, where, soft, parts, of, organisms, are, preserved, as, well, as, their, more, resistant, shells, by, the, end, of, the, cambrian, myriapods, arachnids, and, hexapods, started, adapting, to, the, land, along, with, the, first, plants, the, term, cambrian, is, derived, from, the, latin, version, of, cymru, the, welsh, name, for, wales, where, rocks, of, this, age, were, first, studied, it, was, named, by, adam, sedgwick, in, 1835, who, divided, it, into, three, groups, the, lower, middle, and, upper, he, defined, the, boundary, between, the, cambrian, and, the, overlying, silurian, together, with, roderick, murchison, in, their, joint, paper, on, the, silurian, and, cambrian, systems, exhibiting, the, order, in, which, the, older, sedimentary, strata, succeed, each, other, in, england, and, wales, this, early, agreement, did, not, last, due, to, the, scarcity, of, fossils, sedgwick, used, rock, types, to, identify, cambrian, strata, he, was, also, slow, in, publishing, further, work, the, clear, fossil, record, of, the, silurian, however, allowed, murchison, to, correlate, rocks, of, a, similar, age, across, europe, and, russia, and, on, these, he, published, extensively, as, increasing, numbers, of, fossils, were, identified, in, older, rocks, he, extended, the, base, of, the, silurian, downwards, into, the, sedgwick, s, upper, cambrian, claiming, all, fossilised, strata, for, his, silurian, series, matters, were, complicated, further, when, in, 1852, fieldwork, carried, out, by, sedgwick, and, others, revealed, an, unconformity, within, the, silurian, with, a, clear, difference, in, fauna, between, the, two, this, allowed, sedgwick, to, now, claim, a, large, section, of, the, silurian, for, his, cambrian, and, gave, the, cambrian, an, identifiable, fossil, record, the, dispute, between, the, two, geologists, and, their, supporters, over, the, boundary, between, the, cambrian, and, silurian, would, extend, beyond, the, life, times, of, both, sedgwick, and, murchison, it, was, not, resolved, until, 1879, when, charles, lapworth, proposed, the, disputed, strata, belong, to, its, own, system, which, he, named, the, ordovician, the, term, cambrian, for, the, oldest, period, of, the, paleozoic, was, officially, agreed, in, 1960, at, the, 21st, international, geological, congress, it, only, includes, sedgwick, s, lower, cambrian, series, but, its, base, has, been, extended, into, much, older, rocks, systems, series, and, stages, can, be, defined, globally, or, regionally, for, global, stratigraphic, correlation, the, ics, ratify, rock, units, based, on, a, global, boundary, stratotype, section, and, point, gssp, from, a, single, formation, a, stratotype, identifying, the, lower, boundary, of, the, unit, currently, the, boundaries, of, the, cambrian, system, three, series, and, six, stages, are, defined, by, global, stratotype, sections, and, points, the, lower, boundary, of, the, cambrian, was, originally, held, to, represent, the, first, appearance, of, complex, life, represented, by, trilobites, the, recognition, of, small, shelly, fossils, before, the, first, trilobites, and, ediacara, biota, substantially, earlier, has, led, to, calls, for, a, more, precisely, defined, base, to, the, cambrian, period, despite, the, long, recognition, of, its, distinction, from, younger, ordovician, rocks, and, older, precambrian, rocks, it, was, not, until, 1994, that, the, cambrian, system, period, was, internationally, ratified, after, decades, of, careful, consideration, a, continuous, sedimentary, sequence, at, fortune, head, newfoundland, was, settled, upon, as, a, formal, base, of, the, cambrian, period, which, was, to, be, correlated, worldwide, by, the, earliest, appearance, of, treptichnus, pedum, discovery, of, this, fossil, a, few, metres, below, the, gssp, led, to, the, refinement, of, this, statement, and, it, is, the, t, pedum, ichnofossil, assemblage, that, is, now, formally, used, to, correlate, the, base, of, the, cambrian, this, formal, designation, allowed, radiometric, dates, to, be, obtained, from, samples, across, the, globe, that, corresponded, to, the, base, of, the, cambrian, an, early, date, of, 570, ma, quickly, gained, favour, though, the, methods, used, to, obtain, this, number, are, now, considered, to, be, unsuitable, and, inaccurate, a, more, precise, analysis, using, modern, radiometric, dating, yields, a, date, of, 538, 8, 0, 2, ma, the, ash, horizon, in, oman, from, which, this, date, was, recovered, corresponds, to, a, marked, fall, in, the, abundance, of, carbon, 13, that, correlates, to, equivalent, excursions, elsewhere, in, the, world, and, to, the, disappearance, of, distinctive, ediacaran, fossils, namacalathus, cloudina, nevertheless, there, are, arguments, that, the, dated, horizon, in, oman, does, not, correspond, to, the, ediacaran, cambrian, boundary, but, represents, a, facies, change, from, marine, to, evaporite, dominated, strata, which, would, mean, that, dates, from, other, sections, ranging, from, 544, to, 542, ma, are, more, suitable, most, russian, paleontologists, define, the, lower, boundary, of, the, cambrian, at, the, base, of, the, tommotian, stage, characterized, by, diversification, and, global, distribution, of, organisms, with, mineral, skeletons, and, the, appearance, of, the, first, archaeocyath, bioherms, the, terreneuvian, is, the, lowermost, series, epoch, of, the, cambrian, lasting, from, 538, 8, 0, 2, ma, to, c, 521, ma, it, is, divided, into, two, stages, the, fortunian, stage, 538, 8, 0, 2, ma, to, c, 529, ma, and, the, unnamed, stage, 2, c, 529, ma, to, c, 521, ma, the, name, terreneuvian, was, ratified, by, the, international, union, of, geological, sciences, iugs, in, 2007, replacing, the, previous, cambrian, series, 1, the, gssp, defining, its, base, is, at, fortune, head, on, the, burin, peninsula, eastern, newfoundland, canada, see, ediacaran, cambrian, boundary, above, the, terreneuvian, is, the, only, series, in, the, cambrian, to, contain, no, trilobite, fossils, its, lower, part, is, characterised, by, complex, sediment, penetrating, phanerozoic, type, trace, fossils, and, its, upper, part, by, small, shelly, fossils, the, second, series, epoch, of, the, cambrian, is, currently, unnamed, and, known, as, cambrian, series, 2, it, lasted, from, c, 521, ma, to, c, 509, ma, its, two, stages, are, also, unnamed, and, known, as, cambrian, stage, 3, c, 521, ma, to, c, 514, ma, and, cambrian, stage, 4, c, 514, ma, to, c, 509, ma, the, base, of, series, 2, does, not, yet, have, a, gssp, but, it, is, expected, to, be, defined, in, strata, marking, the, first, appearance, of, trilobites, in, gondwana, there, was, a, rapid, diversification, of, metazoans, during, this, epoch, but, their, restricted, geographic, distribution, particularly, of, the, trilobites, and, archaeocyaths, have, made, global, correlations, difficult, hence, ongoing, efforts, to, establish, a, gssp, the, miaolingian, is, the, third, series, epoch, of, the, cambrian, lasting, from, c, 509, ma, to, c, 497, ma, and, roughly, identical, to, the, middle, cambrian, in, older, literature, it, is, divided, into, three, stages, the, wuliuan, c, 509, ma, to, 504, 5, ma, the, drumian, c, 504, 5, ma, to, c, 500, 5, ma, and, the, guzhangian, c, 500, 5, ma, to, c, 497, ma, the, name, replaces, cambrian, series, 3, and, was, ratified, by, the, iugs, in, 2018, it, is, named, after, the, miaoling, mountains, in, southeastern, guizhou, province, south, china, where, the, gssp, marking, its, base, is, found, this, is, defined, by, the, first, appearance, of, the, oryctocephalid, trilobite, oryctocephalus, indicus, secondary, markers, for, the, base, of, the, miaolingian, include, the, appearance, of, many, acritarchs, forms, a, global, marine, transgression, and, the, disappearance, of, the, polymerid, trilobites, bathynotus, or, ovatoryctocara, unlike, the, terreneuvian, and, series, 2, all, the, stages, of, the, miaolingian, are, defined, by, gssps, the, olenellids, eodiscids, and, most, redlichiids, trilobites, went, extinct, at, the, boundary, between, series, 2, and, the, miaolingian, this, is, considered, the, oldest, mass, extinction, of, trilobites, the, furongian, c, 497, ma, to, 485, 4, 1, 9, ma, is, the, fourth, and, uppermost, series, epoch, of, the, cambrian, the, name, was, ratified, by, the, iugs, in, 2003, and, replaces, cambrian, series, 4, and, the, traditional, upper, cambrian, the, gssp, for, the, base, of, the, furongian, is, in, the, wuling, mountains, in, northwestern, hunan, province, china, it, coincides, with, the, first, appearance, of, the, agnostoid, trilobite, glyptagnostus, reticulatus, and, is, near, the, beginning, of, a, large, positive, 13, c, isotopic, excursion, the, furongian, is, divided, into, three, stages, the, paibian, c, 497, ma, to, c, 494, ma, and, the, jiangshanian, c, 494, ma, to, c, 489, 5, ma, which, have, defined, gssps, and, the, unnamed, cambrian, stage, 10, c, 489, 5, ma, to, 485, 4, 1, 9, ma, the, gssp, for, the, cambrian, ordovician, boundary, is, at, green, point, western, newfoundland, canada, and, is, dated, at, 485, 4, ma, it, is, defined, by, the, appearance, of, the, conodont, iapetognathus, fluctivagus, where, these, conodonts, are, not, found, the, appearance, of, planktonic, graptolites, or, the, trilobite, jujuyaspis, borealis, can, be, used, the, boundary, also, corresponds, with, the, peak, of, the, largest, positive, variation, in, the, 13, c, curve, during, the, boundary, time, interval, and, with, a, global, marine, transgression, reconstructing, the, position, of, the, continents, during, the, cambrian, is, based, on, palaeomagnetic, palaeobiogeographic, tectonic, geological, and, palaeoclimatic, data, however, these, have, different, levels, of, uncertainty, and, can, produce, contradictory, locations, for, the, major, continents, this, together, with, the, ongoing, debate, around, the, existence, of, the, neoproterozoic, supercontinent, of, pannotia, means, that, while, most, models, agree, the, continents, lay, in, the, southern, hemisphere, with, the, vast, panthalassa, ocean, covering, most, of, northern, hemisphere, the, exact, distribution, and, timing, of, the, movements, of, the, cambrian, continents, varies, between, models, most, models, show, gondwana, stretching, from, the, south, polar, region, to, north, of, the, equator, early, in, the, cambrian, the, south, pole, corresponded, with, the, western, south, american, sector, and, as,

continent, situated, off, north, central, gondwana, the, location, of, north, china, is, unclear, it, may, have, lain, along, the, northeast, indian, sector, of, gondwana, or, already, have, been, a, separate, continent, during, the, cambrian, laurentia, lay, across, or, close, to, the, equator, it, drifted, south, and, rotated, c, 20, anticlockwise, during, the, middle, cambrian, before,

laurentia, was, largely, surrounded, by, passive, margins, with, much, of, the, continent, covered, by, shallow, seas, as, laurentia, separated, from, gondwana, a, sliver, of, continental, terrane, rifted, from, laurentia, with, the, narrow, taconic, seaway, opening, between, them, the, remains, of, this, terrane, are, now, found, in, southern, scotland, ireland, and, newfoundland, intra, oceanic, subduction, either, to, the, southeast, of, this, terrane, in, the, iapetus, or, to, its, northwest, in, the, taconic, seaway, resulted, in, the, formation, of, an, island, arc, this, accreted, to, the, terrane, in, the, late, cambrian, triggering, southeast, dipping, subduction, beneath, the, terrane, itself, and, consequent, closure, of, the, marginal, seaway, the, terrane, collided, with, laurentia, in, the, early, ordovician, towards, the, end, of, the, early, cambrian, rifting, along, laurentia, s, southeastern, margin, led, to, the, separation, of, cuyania, now, part, of, argentina, from, the, ouachita, embayment, with, a, new, ocean, established, that, continued, to, widen, through, the, cambrian, and, early, ordovician, gondwana, was, a, massive, continent, three, times, the, size, of, any, of, the, other, cambrian, continents, its, continental, land, area, extended, from, the, south, pole, to, north, of, the, equator, around, it, were, extensive, shallow, seas, and, numerous, smaller, land, areas, the, cratons, that, formed, gondwana, came, together, during, the, neoproterozoic, to, early, cambrian, a, narrow, ocean, separated, amazonia, from, gondwana, until, c, 530, ma, and, the, arequipa, antofalla, block, united, with, the, south, american, sector, of, gondwana, in, the, early, cambrian, the, kuunga, orogeny, between, northern, congo, craton, madagascar, and, india, and, southern, gondwana, kalahari, craton, and, east, antarctica, which, began, c, 570, ma, continued, with, parts, of, northern, gondwana, over, riding, southern, gondwana, and, was, accompanied, by, metamorphism, and, the, intrusion, of, granites, subduction, zones, active, since, the, neoproterozoic, extended, around, much, of, gondwana, s, margins, from, northwest, africa, southwards, round, south, america, south, africa, east, antarctica, and, the, eastern, edge, of, west, australia, shorter, subduction, zones, existed, north, of, arabia, and, india, the, famatinian, continental, arc, stretched, from, central, peru, in, the, north, to, central, argentina, in, the, south, subduction, beneath, this, proto, andean, margin, began, by, the, late, cambrian, along, the, northern, margin, of, gondwana, between, northern, africa, and, the, armorican, terranes, of, southern, europe, the, continental, arc, of, the, cadomian, orogeny, continued, from, the, neoproterozoic, in, response, to, the, oblique, subduction, of, the, iapetus, ocean, this, subduction, extended, west, along, the, gondwanan, margin, and, by, c, 530, ma, may, have, evolved, into, a, major, transform, fault, system, at, c, 511, ma, the, continental, flood, basalts, of, the, kalkarindji, large, igneous, province, lip, began, to, erupt, these, covered, an, area, of, 2, 1, 10, 6, km, 2, across, northern, central, and, western, australia, regions, of, gondwana, making, it, one, of, the, largest, as, well, as, the, earliest, lips, of, the, phanerozoic, the, timing, of, the, eruptions, suggests, they, played, a, role, in, the, early, to, middle, cambrian, mass, extinction, the, terranes, of, ganderia, east, and, west, avalonia, carolinia, and, meguma, lay, in, polar, regions, during, the, early, cambrian, and, high, to, mid, southern, latitudes, by, the, mid, to, late, cambrian, they, are, commonly, shown, as, an, island, arc, transform, fault, system, along, the, northwestern, margin, of, gondwana, north, of, northwest, africa, and, amazonia, which, rifted, from, gondwana, during, the, ordovician, however, some, models, show, these, terranes, as, part, of, a, single, independent, microcontinent, greater, avalonia, lying, to, the, west, of, baltica, and, aligned, with, its, eastern, timanide, margin, with, the, iapetus, to, the, north, and, the, ran, ocean, to, the, south, during, the, cambrian, baltica, rotated, more, than, 60, anti, clockwise, and, began, to, drift, northwards, this, rotation, was, accommodated, by, major,

associated, with, the, ediacaran, timanian, orogeny, was, coming, to, an, end, in, this, region, the, early, to, middle, cambrian, was, a, time, of, non, deposition, and, followed, by, late, cambrian, rifting, and, sedimentation, its, southeastern, margin, was, also, a, convergent, boundary, with, the, accretion, of, island, arcs, and, microcontinents, to, the, craton, although, the, details, are, unclear, siberia, began, the, cambrian, close, to, western, gondwana, and, north, of, baltica, it, drifted, northwestwards, to, close, to, the, equator, as, the, gir, ocean, opened, between, it, and, baltica, much, of, the, continent, was, covered, by, shallow, seas, with, extensive, archaeocyathan, reefs, the, then, northern, third, of, the, continent, present, day, south, siberia, has, rotated, 180, since, the, cambrian, adjacent, to, its, convergent, margin, was, mountainous, from, the, late, neoproterozoic, to, the, ordovician, a, series, of, island, arcs, accreted, to, siberia, s, then, northeastern, margin, accompanied, by, extensive, arc, and, back, arc, volcanism, these, now, form, the, altai, sayan, terranes, some, models, show, a, convergent, plate, margin, extending, from, greater, avalonia, through, the, timanide, margin, of, baltica, forming, the, kipchak, island, arc, offshore, of, southeastern, siberia, and, curving, round, to, become, part, of, the, altai, sayan,

only, a, moderate, pole, to, equator, temperature, gradient, there, is, evidence, of, glaciation, at, high, latitudes, on, avalonia, however, it, is, unclear, whether, these, sediments, are, early, cambrian, or, actually, late, neoproterozoic, in, age, calculations, of, global, average, temperatures, gat, vary, depending, on, which, techniques, are, used, whilst, some, measurements, show, gat,

of, organic, carbon, and, sulphur, which, over, time, reduced, atmospheric, and, oceanic, oxygen, levels, leading, to, widespread, anoxic, conditions, periods, of, higher, rates, of, continental, weathering, led, to, increased, delivery, of, nutrients, to, the, oceans, boosting, productivity, of, phytoplankton, and, stimulating, metazoan, evolution, however, rapid, increases, in, nutrient, supply, led, to, eutrophication, where, rapid, growth, in, phytoplankton, numbers, result, in, the, depletion, of, oxygen, in, the, surrounding, waters, pulses, of, increased, oxygen, levels, are,

burial, a, process, which, also, releases, oxygen, leading, to, stable, levels, of, oxygen, in, the, atmosphere, however, during, the, early, cambrian, a, series, of, linked, 13, c, and, 34, s, excursions, indicate, high, burial, rates, of, both, organic, carbon, and, pyrite, in, biologically, productive, yet, anoxic, ocean, floor, waters, the, oxygen, rich, waters, produced, by, these, processes, spread, from, the, deep, ocean, into, shallow, marine, environments, extending, the, habitable, regions, of, the, seafloor, these, pulses, of, oxygen, are, associated, with, the, radiation, of, the, small, shelly, fossils, and, the, cambrian, arthropod, radiation, isotope, excursion, care, the, increase, in, oxygenated, waters, in, the, deep, ocean, ultimately, reduced, the, levels, of,

however, many, of, those, phyla, were, represented, only, by, stem, group, forms, and, since, mineralized, phyla, generally, have, a, benthic, origin, they, may, not, be, a, good, proxy, for, more, abundant, non, mineralized, phyla, while, the, early, cambrian, showed, such, diversification, that, it, has, been, named, the, cambrian, explosion, this, changed, later, in, the, period, when, there,

as, archaeocyatha, returned, once, more, as, the, archaeocyathids, became, extinct, this, declining, trend, did, not, change, until, the, great, ordovician, biodiversification, event, some, cambrian, organisms, ventured, onto, land, producing, the, trace, fossils, protichnites, and, climactichnites, fossil, evidence, suggests, that, euthycarcinoids, an, extinct, group, of, arthropods, produced,
