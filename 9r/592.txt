granite, r, n, t, gran, it, is, a, coarse, grained, phaneritic, intrusive, igneous, rock, composed, mostly, of, quartz, alkali, feldspar, and, plagioclase, it, forms, from, magma, with, a, high, content, of, silica, and, alkali, metal, oxides, that, slowly, cools, and, solidifies, underground, it, is, common, in, the, continental, crust, of, earth, where, it, is, found, in, igneous, intrusions, these, range, in, size, from, dikes, only, a, few, centimeters, across, to, batholiths, exposed, over, hundreds, of, square, kilometers, granite, is, typical, of, a, larger, family, of, granitic, rocks, or, granitoids, that, are, composed, mostly, of, coarse, grained, quartz, and, feldspars, in, varying, proportions, these, rocks, are, classified, by, the, relative, percentages, of, quartz, alkali, feldspar, and, plagioclase, the, qapf, classification, with, true, granite, representing, granitic, rocks, rich, in, quartz, and, alkali, feldspar, most, granitic, rocks, also, contain, mica, or, amphibole, minerals, though, a, few, known, as, leucogranites, contain, almost, no, dark, minerals, granite, is, nearly, always, massive, lacking, any, internal, structures, hard, and, tough, these, properties, have, made, granite, a, widespread, construction, stone, throughout, human, history, the, word, granite, comes, from, the, latin, granum, a, grain, in, reference, to, the, coarse, grained, structure, of, such, a, completely, crystalline, rock, granitic, rocks, mainly, consist, of, feldspar, quartz, mica, and, amphibole, minerals, which, form, an, interlocking, somewhat, equigranular, matrix, of, feldspar, and, quartz, with, scattered, darker, biotite, mica, and, amphibole, often, hornblende, peppering, the, lighter, color, minerals, occasionally, some, individual, crystals, phenocrysts, are, larger, than, the, groundmass, in, which, case, the, texture, is, known, as, porphyritic, a, granitic, rock, with, a, porphyritic, texture, is, known, as, a, granite, porphyry, granitoid, is, a, general, descriptive, field, term, for, lighter, colored, coarse, grained, igneous, rocks, petrographic, examination, is, required, for, identification, of, specific, types, of, granitoids, granites, can, be, predominantly, white, pink, or, gray, in, color, depending, on, their, mineralogy, the, alkali, feldspar, in, granites, is, typically, orthoclase, or, microcline, and, is, often, perthitic, the, plagioclase, is, typically, sodium, rich, oligoclase, phenocrysts, are, usually, alkali, feldspar, granitic, rocks, are, classified, according, to, the, qapf, diagram, for, coarse, grained, plutonic, rocks, and, are, named, according, to, the, percentage, of, quartz, alkali, feldspar, orthoclase, sanidine, or, microcline, and, plagioclase, feldspar, on, the, a, q, p, half, of, the, diagram, true, granite, according, to, modern, petrologic, convention, contains, between, 20, and, 60, quartz, by, volume, with, 35, to, 90, of, the, total, feldspar, consisting, of, alkali, feldspar, granitic, rocks, poorer, in, quartz, are, classified, as, syenites, or, monzonites, while, granitic, rocks, dominated, by, plagioclase, are, classified, as, granodiorites, or, tonalites, granitic, rocks, with, over, 90, alkali, feldspar, are, classified, as, alkali, feldspar, granites, granitic, rock, with, more, than, 60, quartz, which, is, uncommon, is, classified, simply, as, quartz, rich, granitoid, or, if, composed, almost, entirely, of, quartz, as, quartzolite, true, granites, are, further, classified, by, the, percentage, of, their, total, feldspar, that, is, alkali, feldspar, granites, whose, feldspar, is, 65, to, 90, alkali, feldspar, are, syenogranites, while, the, feldspar, in, monzogranite, is, 35, to, 65, alkali, feldspar, a, granite, containing, both, muscovite, and, biotite, micas, is, called, a, binary, or, two, mica, granite, two, mica, granites, are, typically, high, in, potassium, and, low, in, plagioclase, and, are, usually, s, type, granites, or, a, type, granites, as, described, below, another, aspect, of, granite, classification, is, the, ratios, of, metals, that, potentially, form, feldspars, most, granites, have, a, composition, such, that, almost, all, their, aluminum, and, alkali, metals, sodium, and, potassium, are, combined, as, feldspar, this, is, the, case, when, k, 2, o, na, 2, o, cao, al, 2, o, 3, k, 2, o, na, 2, o, such, granites, are, described, as, normal, or, metaluminous, granites, in, which, there, is, not, enough, aluminum, to, combine, with, all, the, alkali, oxides, as, feldspar, al, 2, o, 3, k, 2, o, na, 2, o, are, described, as, peralkaline, and, they, contain, unusual, sodium, amphiboles, such, as, riebeckite, granites, in, which, there, is, an, excess, of, aluminum, beyond, what, can, be, taken, up, in, feldspars, al, 2, o, 3, cao, k, 2, o, na, 2, o, are, described, as, peraluminous, and, they, contain, aluminum, rich, minerals, such, as, muscovite, the, average, density, of, granite, is, between, 2, 65, and, 2, 75, g, cm, 3, 165, and, 172, lb, cu, ft, its, compressive, strength, usually, lies, above, 200, mpa, 29, 000, psi, and, its, viscosity, near, stp, is, 3, 6, 10, 20, pa, s, the, melting, temperature, of, dry, granite, at, ambient, pressure, is, 1215, 1260, c, 2219, 2300, f, it, is, strongly, reduced, in, the, presence, of, water, down, to, 650, c, at, a, few, hundred, megapascals, of, pressure, granite, has, poor, primary, permeability, overall, but, strong, secondary, permeability, through, cracks, and, fractures, if, they, are, present, a, worldwide, average, of, the, chemical, composition, of, granite, by, weight, percent, based, on, 2485, analyses, the, medium, grained, equivalent, of, granite, is, microgranite, the, extrusive, igneous, rock, equivalent, of, granite, is, rhyolite, granitic, rock, is, widely, distributed, throughout, the, continental, crust, much, of, it, was, intruded, during, the, precambrian, age, it, is, the, most, abundant, basement, rock, that, underlies, the, relatively, thin, sedimentary, veneer, of, the, continents, outcrops, of, granite, tend, to, form, tors, domes, or, bornhardts, and, rounded, massifs, granites, sometimes, occur, in, circular, depressions, surrounded, by, a, range, of, hills, formed, by, the, metamorphic, aureole, or, hornfels, granite, often, occurs, as, relatively, small, less, than, 100, km, 2, stock, masses, stocks, and, in, batholiths, that, are, often, associated, with, orogenic, mountain, ranges, small, dikes, of, granitic, composition, called, aplites, are, often, associated, with, the, margins, of, granitic, intrusions, in, some, locations, very, coarse, grained, pegmatite, masses, occur, with, granite, granite, forms, from, silica, rich, felsic, magmas, felsic, magmas, are, thought, to, form, by, addition, of, heat, or, water, vapor, to, rock, of, the, lower, crust, rather, than, by, decompression, of, mantle, rock, as, is, the, case, with, basaltic, magmas, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, some, granites, found, at, convergent, boundaries, between, tectonic, plates, where, oceanic, crust, subducts, below, continental, crust, were, formed, from, sediments, subducted, with, the, oceanic, plate, the, melted, sediments, would, have, produced, magma, intermediate, in, its, silica, content, which, became, further, enriched, in, silica, as, it, rose, through, the, overlying, crust, early, fractional, crystallisation, serves, to, reduce, a, melt, in, magnesium, and, chromium, and, enrich, the, melt, in, iron, sodium, potassium, aluminum, and, silicon, further, fractionation, reduces, the, content, of, iron, calcium, and, titanium, this, is, reflected, in, the, high, content, of, alkali, feldspar, and, quartz, in, granite, the, presence, of, granitic, rock, in, island, arcs, shows, that, fractional, crystallization, alone, can, convert, a, basaltic, magma, to, a, granitic, magma, but, the, quantities, produced, are, small, for, example, granitic, rock, makes, up, just, 4, of, the, exposures, in, the, south, sandwich, islands, in, continental, arc, settings, granitic, rocks, are, the, most, common, plutonic, rocks, and, batholiths, composed, of, these, rock, types, extend, the, entire, length, of, the, arc, there, are, no, indication, of, magma, chambers, where, basaltic, magmas, differentiate, into, granites, or, of, cumulates, produced, by, mafic, crystals, settling, out, of, the, magma, other, processes, must, produce, these, great, volumes, of, felsic, magma, one, such, process, is, injection, of, basaltic, magma, into, the, lower, crust, followed, by, differentiation, which, leaves, any, cumulates, in, the, mantle, another, is, heating, of, the, lower, crust, by, underplating, basaltic, magma, which, produces, felsic, magma, directly, from, crustal, rock, the, two, processes, produce, different, kinds, of, granites, which, may, be, reflected, in, the, division, between, s, type, produced, by, underplating, and, i, type, produced, by, injection, and, differentiation, granites, discussed, below, the, composition, and, origin, of, any, magma, that, differentiates, into, granite, leave, certain, petrological, evidence, as, to, what, the, granite, s, parental, rock, was, the, final, texture, and, composition, of, a, granite, are, generally, distinctive, as, to, its, parental, rock, for, instance, a, granite, that, is, derived, from, partial, melting, of, metasedimentary, rocks, may, have, more, alkali, feldspar, whereas, a, granite, derived, from, partial, melting, of, metaigneous, rocks, may, be, richer, in, plagioclase, it, is, on, this, basis, that, the, modern, alphabet, classification, schemes, are, based, the, letter, based, chappell, white, classification, system, was, proposed, initially, to, divide, granites, into, i, type, igneous, source, granite, and, s, type, sedimentary, sources, both, types, are, produced, by, partial, melting, of, crustal, rocks, either, metaigneous, rocks, or, metasedimentary, rocks, i, type, granites, are, characterized, by, a, high, content, of, sodium, and, calcium, and, by, a, strontium, isotope, ratio, 87, sr, 86, sr, of, less, than, 0, 708, 87, sr, is, produced, by, radioactive, decay, of, 87, rb, and, since, rubidium, is, concentrated, in, the, crust, relative, to, the, mantle, a, low, ratio, suggests, origin, in, the, mantle, the, elevated, sodium, and, calcium, favor, crystallization, of, hornblende, rather, than, biotite, i, type, granites, are, known, for, their, porphyry, copper, deposits, i, type, granites, are, orogenic, associated, with, mountain, building, and, usually, metaluminous, s, type, granites, are, sodium, poor, and, aluminum, rich, as, a, result, they, contain, micas, such, as, biotite, and, muscovite, instead, of, hornblende, their, strontium, isotope, ratio, is, typically, greater, than, 0, 708, suggesting, a, crustal, origin, they, also, commonly, contain, xenoliths, of, metamorphosed, sedimentary, rock, and, host, tin, ores, their, magmas, are, water, rich, and, they, readily, solidify, as, the, water, outgasses, from, the, magma, at, lower, pressure, so, they, less, commonly, make, it, to, the, surface, than, magmas, of, i, type, granites, which, are, thus, more, common, as, volcanic, rock, rhyolite, they, are, also, orogenic, but, range, from, metaluminous, to, strongly, peraluminous, although, both, i, and, s, type, granites, are, orogenic, i, type, granites, are, more, common, close, to, the, convergent, boundary, than, s, type, this, is, attributed, to, thicker, crust, further, from, the, boundary, which, results, in, more, crustal, melting, a, type, granites, show, a, peculiar, mineralogy, and, geochemistry, with, particularly, high, silicon, and, potassium, at, the, expense, of, calcium, and, magnesium, and, a, high, content, of, high, field, strength, cations, cations, with, a, small, radius, and, high, electrical, charge, such, as, zirconium, niobium, tantalum, and, rare, earth, elements, they, are, not, orogenic, forming, instead, over, hot, spots, and, continental, rifting, and, are, metaluminous, to, mildly, peralkaline, and, iron, rich, these, granites, are, produced, by, partial, melting, of, refractory, lithology, such, as, granulites, in, the, lower, continental, crust, at, high, thermal, gradients, this, leads, to, significant, extraction, of, hydrous, felsic, melts, from, granulite, facies, resitites, a, type, granites, occur, in, the, koettlitz, glacier, alkaline, province, in, the, royal, society, range, antarctica, the, rhyolites, of, the, yellowstone, caldera, are, examples, of, volcanic, equivalents, of, a, type, granite, m, type, granite, was, later, proposed, to, cover, those, granites, that, were, clearly, sourced, from, crystallized, mafic, magmas, generally, sourced, from, the, mantle, although, the, fractional, crystallisation, of, basaltic, melts, can, yield, small, amounts, of, granites, which, are, sometimes, found, in, island, arcs, such, granites, must, occur, together, with, large, amounts, of, basaltic, rocks, h, type, granites, were, suggested, for, hybrid, granites, which, were, hypothesized, to, form, by, mixing, between, mafic, and, felsic, from, different, sources, such, as, m, type, and, s, type, however, the, big, difference, in, rheology, between, mafic, and, felsic, magmas, makes, this, process, problematic, in, nature, granitization, is, an, old, and, largely, discounted, hypothesis, that, granite, is, formed, in, place, through, extreme, metasomatism, the, idea, behind, granitization, was, that, fluids, would, supposedly, bring, in, elements, such, as, potassium, and, remove, others, such, as, calcium, to, transform, a, metamorphic, rock, into, granite, this, was, supposed, to, occur, across, a, migrating, front, however, experimental, work, had, established, by, the, 1960s, that, granites, were, of, igneous, origin, the, mineralogical, and, chemical, features, of, granite, can, be, explained, only, by, crystal, liquid, phase, relations, showing, that, there, must, have, been, at, least, enough, melting, to, mobilize, the, magma, however, at, sufficiently, deep, crustal, levels, the, distinction, between, metamorphism, and, crustal, melting, itself, becomes, vague, conditions, for, crystallization, of, liquid, magma, are, close, enough, to, those, of, high, grade, metamorphism, that, the, rocks, often, bear, a, close, resemblance, under, these, conditions, granitic, melts, can, be, produced, in, place, through, the, partial, melting, of, metamorphic, rocks, by, extracting, melt, mobile, elements, such, as, potassium, and, silicon, into, the, melts, but, leaving, others, such, as, calcium, and, iron, in, granulite, residues, this, may, be, the, origin, of, migmatites, a, migmatite, consists, of, dark, refractory, rock, the, melanosome, that, is, permeated, by, sheets, and, channels, of, light, granitic, rock, the, leucosome, the, leucosome, is, interpreted, as, partial, melt, of, a, parent, rock, that, has, begun, to, separate, from, the, remaining, solid, residue, the, melanosome, if, enough, partial, melt, is, produced, it, will, separate, from, the, source, rock, become, more, highly, evolved, through, fractional, crystallization, during, its, ascent, toward, the, surface, and, become, the, magmatic, parent, of, granitic, rock, the, residue, of, the, source, rock, becomes, a, granulite, the, partial, melting, of, solid, rocks, requires, high, temperatures, and, the, addition, of, water, or, other, volatiles, which, lower, the, solidus, temperature, temperature, at, which, partial, melting, commences, of, these, rocks, it, was, long, debated, whether, crustal, thickening, in, orogens, mountain, belts, along, convergent, boundaries, was, sufficient, to, produce, granite, melts, by, radiogenic, heating, but, recent, work, suggests, that, this, is, not, a, viable, mechanism, in, situ, granitization, requires, heating, by, the, asthenospheric, mantle, or, by, underplating, with, mantle, derived, magmas, granite, magmas, have, a, density, of, 2, 4, mg, m, 3, much, less, than, the, 2, 8, mg, m, 3, of, high, grade, metamorphic, rock, this, gives, them, tremendous, buoyancy, so, that, ascent, of, the, magma, is, inevitable, once, enough, magma, has, accumulated, however, the, question, of, precisely, how, such, large, quantities, of, magma, are, able, to, shove, aside, country, rock, to, make, room, for, themselves, the, room, problem, is, still, a, matter, of, research, two, main, mechanisms, are, thought, to, be, important, of, these, two, mechanisms, stokes, diapirism, has, been, favoured, for, many, years, in, the, absence, of, a, reasonable, alternative, the, basic, idea, is, that, magma, will, rise, through, the, crust, as, a, single, mass, through, buoyancy, as, it, rises, it, heats, the, wall, rocks, causing, them, to, behave, as, a, power, law, fluid, and, thus, flow, around, the, intrusion, allowing, it, to, pass, without, major, heat, loss, this, is, entirely, feasible, in, the, warm, ductile, lower, crust, where, rocks, are, easily, deformed, but, runs, into, problems, in, the, upper, crust, which, is, far, colder, and, more, brittle, rocks, there, do, not, deform, so, easily, for, magma, to, rise, as, a, diapir, it, would, expend, far, too, much, energy, in, heating, wall, rocks, thus, cooling, and, solidifying, before, reaching, higher, levels, within, the, crust, fracture, propagation, is, the, mechanism, preferred, by, many, geologists, as, it, largely, eliminates, the, major, problems, of, moving, a, huge, mass, of, magma, through, cold, brittle, crust, magma, rises, instead, in, small, channels, along, self, propagating, dykes, which, form, along, new, or, pre, existing, fracture, or, fault, systems, and, networks, of, active, shear, zones, as, these, narrow, conduits, open, the, first, magma, to, enter, solidifies, and, provides, a, form, of, insulation, for, later, magma, these, mechanisms, can, operate, in, tandem, for, example, diapirs, may, continue, to, rise, through, the, brittle, upper, crust, through, stoping, where, the, granite, cracks, the, roof, rocks, removing, blocks, of, the, overlying, crust, which, then, sink, to, the, bottom, of, the, diapir, while, the, magma, rises, to, take, their, place, this, can, occur, as, piecemeal, stopping, stoping, of, small, blocks, of, chamber, roof, as, cauldron, subsidence, collapse, of, large, blocks, of, chamber, roof, or, as, roof, foundering, complete, collapse, of, the, roof, of, a, shallow, magma, chamber, accompanied, by, a, caldera, eruption, there, is, evidence, for, cauldron, subsidence, at, the, mt, ascutney, intrusion, in, eastern, vermont, evidence, for, piecemeal, stoping, is, found, in, intrusions, that, are, rimmed, with, igneous, breccia, containing, fragments, of, country, rock, assimilation, is, another, mechanism, of, ascent, where, the, granite, melts, its, way, up, into, the, crust, and, removes, overlying, material, in, this, way, this, is, limited, by, the, amount, of, thermal, energy, available, which, must, be, replenished, by, crystallization, of, higher, melting, minerals, in, the, magma, thus, the, magma, is, melting, crustal, rock, at, its, roof, while, simultaneously, crystallizing, at, its, base, this, results, in, steady, contamination, with, crustal, material, as, the, magma, rises, this, may, not, be, evident, in, the, major, and, minor, element, chemistry, since, the, minerals, most, likely, to, crystallize, at, the, base, of, the, chamber, are, the, same, ones, that, would, crystallize, anyway, but, crustal, assimilation, is, detectable, in, isotope, ratios, heat, loss, to, the, country, rock, means, that, ascent, by, assimilation, is, limited, to, distance, similar, to, the, height, of, the, magma, chamber, physical, weathering, occurs, on, a, large, scale, in, the, form, of, exfoliation, joints, which, are, the, result, of, granite, s, expanding, and, fracturing, as, pressure, is, relieved, when, overlying, material, is, removed, by, erosion, or, other, processes, chemical, weathering, of, granite, occurs, when, dilute, carbonic, acid, and, other, acids, present, in, rain, and, soil, waters, alter, feldspar, in, a, process, called, hydrolysis, as, demonstrated, in, the, following, reaction, this, causes, potassium, feldspar, to, form, kaolinite, with, potassium, ions, bicarbonate, and, silica, in, solution, as, byproducts, an, end, product, of, granite, weathering, is, grus, which, is, often, made, up, of, coarse, grained, fragments, of, disintegrated, granite, climatic, variations, also, influence, the, weathering, rate, of, granites, for, about, two, thousand, years, the, relief, engravings, on, cleopatra, s, needle, obelisk, had, survived, the, arid, conditions, of, its, origin, before, its, transfer, to, london, within, two, hundred, years, the, red, granite, has, drastically, deteriorated, in, the, damp, and, polluted, air, there, soil, development, on, granite, reflects, the, rock, s, high, quartz, content, and, dearth, of, available, bases, with, the, base, poor, status, predisposing, the, soil, to, acidification, and, podzolization, in, cool, humid, climates, as, the, weather, resistant, quartz, yields, much, sand, feldspars, also, weather, slowly, in, cool, climes, allowing, sand, to, dominate, the, fine, earth, fraction, in, warm, humid, regions, the, weathering, of, feldspar, as, described, above, is, accelerated, so, as, to, allow, a, much, higher, proportion, of, clay, with, the, cecil, soil, series, a, prime, example, of, the, consequent, ultisol, great, soil, group, granite, is, a, natural, source, of, radiation, like, most, natural, stones, potassium, 40, is, a, radioactive, isotope, of, weak, emission, and, a, constituent, of, alkali, feldspar, which, in, turn, is, a, common, component, of, granitic, rocks, more, abundant, in, alkali, feldspar, granite, and, syenites, some, granites, contain, around, 10, to, 20, parts, per, million, ppm, of, uranium, by, contrast, more, mafic, rocks, such, as, tonalite, gabbro, and, diorite, have, 1, to, 5, ppm, uranium, and, limestones, and, sedimentary, rocks, usually, have, equally, low, amounts, many, large, granite, plutons, are, sources, for, palaeochannel, hosted, or, roll, front, uranium, ore, deposits, where, the, uranium, washes, into, the, sediments, from, the, granite, uplands, and, associated, often, highly, radioactive, pegmatites, cellars, and, basements, built, into, soils, over, granite, can, become, a, trap, for, radon, gas, which, is, formed, by, the, decay,

has, been, noted, for, its, relatively, high, thorium, concentration, of, 56, 6, ppm, there, is, some, concern, that, some, granite, sold, as, countertops, or, building, material, may, be, hazardous, to, health, dan, steck, of, st, johns, university, has, stated, that, approximately, 5, of, all, granite, is, of, concern, with, the, caveat, that, only, a, tiny, percentage, of, the, tens, of, thousands, of, granite, slab, types, have, been, tested, resources, from, national, geological, survey, organizations, are, accessible, online, to, assist, in, assessing, the, risk, factors, in,

monumental, architecture, the, quarrying, ceased, around, the, third, century, ad, beginning, in, late, antiquity, the, granite, was, reused, which, since, at, least, the, early, 16th, century, became, known, as, spolia, through, the, process, of, case, hardening, granite, becomes, harder, with, age, the, technology, required, to, make, tempered, metal, chisels, was, largely, forgotten, during, the, middle, ages, as, a, result, medieval, stoneworkers, were, forced, to, use, saws, or, emery, to, shorten, ancient, columns, or, hack, them, into, discs, giorgio, vasari, noted, in, the, 16th, century, that, granite, in, quarries, was, far, softer, and, easier, to, work, than, after, it, has, lain, exposed, while, ancient, columns, because, of, their, hardness, and, solidity, have, nothing, to, fear, from, fire, or, sword, and, time, itself, that, drives, everything, to, ruin, not, only, has, not, destroyed, them, but, has, not, even, altered, their, colour, in, some, areas, granite, is, used, for, gravestones, and, memorials, granite, is, a, hard, stone, and, requires, skill, to, carve, by, hand, until, the, early, 18th, century, in, the, western, world, granite, could, be, carved, only, by, hand, tools, with, generally, poor, results, a, key, breakthrough, was, the, invention, of, steam, powered, cutting, and, dressing, tools, by, alexander, macdonald, of, aberdeen, inspired, by, seeing, ancient, egyptian, granite, carvings, in, 1832, the, first, polished, tombstone, of, aberdeen, granite, to, be, erected, in, an, english, cemetery, was, installed, at, kensal, green, cemetery, it, caused, a, sensation, in, the, london, monumental, trade, and, for, some, years, all, polished, granite, ordered, came, from, macdonald, s, as, a, result, of, the, work, of, sculptor, william, leslie, and, later, sidney, field, granite, memorials, became, a, major, status, symbol, in, victorian, britain, the, royal, sarcophagus, at, frogmore, was, probably, the, pinnacle, of, its, work, and, at, 30, tons, one, of, the, largest, it, was, not, until, the, 1880s, that, rival, machinery, and, works, could, compete, with, the, macdonald, works, modern, methods, of, carving, include, using, computer, controlled, rotary, bits, and, sandblasting, over, a, rubber, stencil, leaving, the, letters, numbers, and, emblems, exposed, and, the, remainder, of, the, stone, covered, with, rubber, the, blaster, can, create, virtually, any, kind, of, artwork, or, epitaph, the, stone, known, as, black, granite, is, usually, gabbro, which, has, a, completely, different, chemical, composition, granite, has, been, extensively, used, as, a, dimension, stone, and, as, flooring, tiles, in, public, and, commercial, buildings, and, monuments, aberdeen, in, scotland, which, is,

traditionally, used, polished, granite, surface, plates, to, establish, a, plane, of, reference, since, they, are, relatively, impervious, inflexible, and, maintain, good, dimensional, stability, sandblasted, concrete, with, a, heavy, aggregate, content, has, an, appearance, similar, to, rough, granite, and, is, often, used, as, a, substitute, when, use, of, real, granite, is, impractical, granite, tables, are, used, extensively, as, bases, or, even, as, the, entire, structural, body, of, optical, instruments, cmms, and, very, high, precision, cnc, machines, because, of, granite, s, rigidity, high, dimensional, stability, and, excellent, vibration, characteristics, a, most, unusual, use, of, granite, was, as, the, material, of, the, tracks, of, the, haytor, granite, tramway,

permeable, and, requires, little, maintenance, for, example, in, sydney, australia, black, granite, stone, is, used, for, the, paving, and, kerbs, throughout, the, central, business, district, curling, stones, are, traditionally, fashioned, of, ailsa, craig, granite, the, first, stones, were, made, in, the, 1750s, the, original, source, being, ailsa, craig, in, scotland, because, of, the, rarity, of, this, granite, the, best, stones, can, cost, as, much, as, us, 1, 500, between, 60, and, 70, percent, of, the, stones, used, today, are, made, from, ailsa, craig, granite, although, the, island, is, now, a, wildlife, reserve, it, is, still, quarried, under, license, for, ailsa, granite, by, kays, of, scotland, for, curling, stones, granite, is, one, of, the, rocks, most, prized, by,
