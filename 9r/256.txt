stellar, evolution, is, the, process, by, which, a, star, changes, over, the, course, of, its, lifetime, and, how, it, can, lead, to, the, creation, of, a, new, star, depending, on, the, mass, of, the, star, its, lifetime, can, range, from, a, few, million, years, for, the, most, massive, to, trillions, of, years, for, the, least, massive, which, is, considerably, longer, than, the, current, age, of, the, universe, the, table, shows, the, lifetimes, of, stars, as, a, function, of, their, masses, all, stars, are, formed, from, collapsing, clouds, of, gas, and, dust, often, called, nebulae, or, molecular, clouds, over, the, course, of, millions, of, years, these, protostars, settle, down, into, a, state, of, equilibrium, becoming, what, is, known, as, a, main, sequence, star, nuclear, fusion, powers, a, star, for, most, of, its, existence, initially, the, energy, is, generated, by, the, fusion, of, hydrogen, atoms, at, the, core, of, the, main, sequence, star, later, as, the, preponderance, of, atoms, at, the, core, becomes, helium, stars, like, the, sun, begin, to, fuse, hydrogen, along, a, spherical, shell, surrounding, the, core, this, process, causes, the, star, to, gradually, grow, in, size, passing, through, the, subgiant, stage, until, it, reaches, the, red, giant, phase, stars, with, at, least, half, the, mass, of, the, sun, can, also, begin, to, generate, energy, through, the, fusion, of, helium, at, their, core, whereas, more, massive, stars, can, fuse, heavier, elements, along, a, series, of, concentric, shells, once, a, star, like, the, sun, has, exhausted, its, nuclear, fuel, its, core, collapses, into, a, dense, white, dwarf, and, the, outer, layers, are, expelled, as, a, planetary, nebula, stars, with, around, ten, or, more, times, the, mass, of, the, sun, can, explode, in, a, supernova, as, their, inert, iron, cores, collapse, into, an, extremely, dense, neutron, star, or, black, hole, although, the, universe, is, not, old, enough, for, any, of, the, smallest, red, dwarfs, to, have, reached, the, end, of, their, existence, stellar, models, suggest, they, will, slowly, become, brighter, and, hotter, before, running, out, of, hydrogen, fuel, and, becoming, low, mass, white, dwarfs, stellar, evolution, is, not, studied, by, observing, the, life, of, a, single, star, as, most, stellar, changes, occur, too, slowly, to, be, detected, even, over, many, centuries, instead, astrophysicists, come, to, understand, how, stars, evolve, by, observing, numerous, stars, at, various, points, in, their, lifetime, and, by, simulating, stellar, structure, using, computer, models, stellar, evolution, starts, with, the, gravitational, collapse, of, a, giant, molecular, cloud, typical, giant, molecular, clouds, are, roughly, 100, light, years, 9, 5, 10, 14, km, across, and, contain, up, to, 6, 000, 000, solar, masses, 1, 2, 10, 37, kg, as, it, collapses, a, giant, molecular, cloud, breaks, into, smaller, and, smaller, pieces, in, each, of, these, fragments, the, collapsing, gas, releases, gravitational, potential, energy, as, heat, as, its, temperature, and, pressure, increase, a, fragment, condenses, into, a, rotating, ball, of, superhot, gas, known, as, a, protostar, filamentary, structures, are, truly, ubiquitous, in, the, molecular, cloud, dense, molecular, filaments, will, fragment, into, gravitationally, bound, cores, which, are, the, precursors, of, stars, continuous, accretion, of, gas, geometrical, bending, and, magnetic, fields, may, control, the, detailed, fragmentation, manner, of, the, filaments, in, supercritical, filaments, observations, have, revealed, quasi, periodic, chains, of, dense, cores, with, spacing, comparable, to, the, filament, inner, width, and, embedded, two, protostars, with, gas, outflows, a, protostar, continues, to, grow, by, accretion, of, gas, and, dust, from, the, molecular, cloud, becoming, a, pre, main, sequence, star, as, it, reaches, its, final, mass, further, development, is, determined, by, its, mass, mass, is, typically, compared, to, the, mass, of, the, sun, 1, 0, m, 2, 0, 10, 30, kg, means, 1, solar, mass, protostars, are, encompassed, in, dust, and, are, thus, more, readily, visible, at, infrared, wavelengths, observations, from, the, wide, field, infrared, survey, explorer, wise, have, been, especially, important, for, unveiling, numerous, galactic, protostars, and, their, parent, star, clusters, protostars, with, masses, less, than, roughly, 0, 08, m, 1, 6, 10, 29, kg, never, reach, temperatures, high, enough, for, nuclear, fusion, of, hydrogen, to, begin, these, are, known, as, brown, dwarfs, the, international, astronomical, union, defines, brown, dwarfs, as, stars, massive, enough, to, fuse, deuterium, at, some, point, in, their, lives, 13, jupiter, masses, m, j, 2, 5, 10, 28, kg, or, 0, 0125, m, objects, smaller, than, 13, m, j, are, classified, as, sub, brown, dwarfs, but, if, they, orbit, around, another, stellar, object, they, are, classified, as, planets, both, types, deuterium, burning, and, not, shine, dimly, and, fade, away, slowly, cooling, gradually, over, hundreds, of, millions, of, years, for, a, more, massive, protostar, the, core, temperature, will, eventually, reach, 10, million, kelvin, initiating, the, proton, proton, chain, reaction, and, allowing, hydrogen, to, fuse, first, to, deuterium, and, then, to, helium, in, stars, of, slightly, over, 1, m, 2, 0, 10, 30, kg, the, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fusion, reaction, cno, cycle, contributes, a, large, portion, of, the, energy, generation, the, onset, of, nuclear, fusion, leads, relatively, quickly, to, a, hydrostatic, equilibrium, in, which, energy, released, by, the, core, maintains, a, high, gas, pressure, balancing, the, weight, of, the, star, s, matter, and, preventing, further, gravitational, collapse, the, star, thus, evolves, rapidly, to, a, stable, state, beginning, the, main, sequence, phase, of, its, evolution, a, new, star, will, sit, at, a, specific, point, on, the, main, sequence, of, the, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, with, the, main, sequence, spectral, type, depending, upon, the, mass, of, the, star, small, relatively, cold, low, mass, red, dwarfs, fuse, hydrogen, slowly, and, will, remain, on, the, main, sequence, for, hundreds, of, billions, of, years, or, longer, whereas, massive, hot, o, type, stars, will, leave, the, main, sequence, after, just, a, few, million, years, a, mid, sized, yellow, dwarf, star, like, the, sun, will, remain, on, the, main, sequence, for, about, 10, billion, years, the, sun, is, thought, to, be, in, the, middle, of, its, main, sequence, lifespan, a, star, may, gain, a, protoplanetary, disk, which, furthermore, can, develop, into, a, planetary, system, eventually, the, star, s, core, exhausts, its, supply, of, hydrogen, and, the, star, begins, to, evolve, off, the, main, sequence, without, the, outward, radiation, pressure, generated, by, the, fusion, of, hydrogen, to, counteract, the, force, of, gravity, the, core, contracts, until, either, electron, degeneracy, pressure, becomes, sufficient, to, oppose, gravity, or, the, core, becomes, hot, enough, around, 100, mk, for, helium, fusion, to, begin, which, of, these, happens, first, depends, upon, the, star, s, mass, what, happens, after, a, low, mass, star, ceases, to, produce, energy, through, fusion, has, not, been, directly, observed, the, universe, is, around, 13, 8, billion, years, old, which, is, less, time, by, several, orders, of, magnitude, in, some, cases, than, it, takes, for, fusion, to, cease, in, such, stars, recent, astrophysical, models, suggest, that, red, dwarfs, of, 0, 1, m, may, stay, on, the, main, sequence, for, some, six, to, twelve, trillion, years, gradually, increasing, in, both, temperature, and, luminosity, and, take, several, hundred, billion, years, more, to, collapse, slowly, into, a, white, dwarf, such, stars, will, not, become, red, giants, as, the, whole, star, is, a, convection, zone, and, it, will, not, develop, a, degenerate, helium, core, with, a, shell, burning, hydrogen, instead, hydrogen, fusion, will, proceed, until, almost, the, whole, star, is, helium, slightly, more, massive, stars, do, expand, into, red, giants, but, their, helium, cores, are, not, massive, enough, to, reach, the, temperatures, required, for, helium, fusion, so, they, never, reach, the, tip, of, the, red, giant, branch, when, hydrogen, shell, burning, finishes, these, stars, move, directly, off, the, red, giant, branch, like, a, post, asymptotic, giant, branch, agb, star, but, at, lower, luminosity, to, become, a, white, dwarf, a, star, with, an, initial, mass, about, 0, 6, m, will, be, able, to, reach, temperatures, high, enough, to, fuse, helium, and, these, mid, sized, stars, go, on, to, further, stages, of, evolution, beyond, the, red, giant, branch, stars, of, roughly, 0, 6, 10, m, become, red, giants, which, are, large, non, main, sequence, stars, of, stellar, classification, k, or, m, red, giants, lie, along, the, right, edge, of, the, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, due, to, their, red, color, and, large, luminosity, examples, include, aldebaran, in, the, constellation, taurus, and, arcturus, in, the, constellation, of, bo, tes, mid, sized, stars, are, red, giants, during, two, different, phases, of, their, post, main, sequence, evolution, red, giant, branch, stars, with, inert, cores, made, of, helium, and, hydrogen, burning, shells, and, asymptotic, giant, branch, stars, with, inert, cores, made, of, carbon, and, helium, burning, shells, inside, the, hydrogen, burning, shells, between, these, two, phases, stars, spend, a, period, on, the, horizontal, branch, with, a, helium, fusing, core, many, of, these, helium, fusing, stars, cluster, towards, the, cool, end, of, the, horizontal, branch, as, k, type, giants, and, are, referred, to, as, red, clump, giants, when, a, star, exhausts, the, hydrogen, in, its, core, it, leaves, the, main, sequence, and, begins, to, fuse, hydrogen, in, a, shell, outside, the, core, the, core, increases, in, mass, as, the, shell, produces, more, helium, depending, on, the, mass, of, the, helium, core, this, continues, for, several, million, to, one, or, two, billion, years, with, the, star, expanding, and, cooling, at, a, similar, or, slightly, lower, luminosity, to, its, main, sequence, state, eventually, either, the, core, becomes, degenerate, in, stars, around, the, mass, of, the, sun, or, the, outer, layers, cool, sufficiently, to, become, opaque, in, more, massive, stars, either, of, these, changes, cause, the, hydrogen, shell, to, increase, in, temperature, and, the, luminosity, of, the, star, to, increase, at, which, point, the, star, expands, onto, the, red, giant, branch, the, expanding, outer, layers, of, the, star, are, convective, with, the, material, being, mixed, by, turbulence, from, near, the, fusing, regions, up, to, the, surface, of, the, star, for, all, but, the, lowest, mass, stars, the, fused, material, has, remained, deep, in, the, stellar, interior, prior, to, this, point, so, the, convecting, envelope, makes, fusion, products, visible, at, the, star, s, surface, for, the, first, time, at, this, stage, of, evolution, the, results, are, subtle, with, the, largest, effects, alterations, to, the, isotopes, of, hydrogen, and, helium, being, unobservable, the, effects, of, the, cno, cycle, appear, at, the, surface, during, the, first, dredge, up, with, lower, 12, c, 13, c, ratios, and, altered, proportions, of, carbon, and, nitrogen, these, are, detectable, with, spectroscopy, and, have, been, measured, for, many, evolved, stars, the, helium, core, continues, to, grow, on, the, red, giant, branch, it, is, no, longer, in, thermal, equilibrium, either, degenerate, or, above, the, sch, nberg, chandrasekhar, limit, so, it, increases, in, temperature, which, causes, the, rate, of, fusion, in, the, hydrogen, shell, to, increase, the, star, increases, in, luminosity, towards, the, tip, of, the, red, giant, branch, red, giant, branch, stars, with, a, degenerate, helium, core, all, reach, the, tip, with, very, similar, core, masses, and, very, similar, luminosities, although, the, more, massive, of, the, red, giants, become, hot, enough, to, ignite, helium, fusion, before, that, point, in, the, helium, cores, of, stars, in, the, 0, 6, to, 2, 0, solar, mass, range, which, are, largely, supported, by, electron, degeneracy, pressure, helium, fusion, will, ignite, on, a, timescale, of, days, in, a, helium, flash, in, the, nondegenerate, cores, of, more, massive, stars, the, ignition, of, helium, fusion, occurs, relatively, slowly, with, no, flash, the, nuclear, power, released, during, the, helium, flash, is, very, large, on, the, order, of, 10, 8, times, the, luminosity, of, the, sun, for, a, few, days, and, 10, 11, times, the, luminosity, of, the, sun, roughly, the, luminosity, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, for, a, few, seconds, however, the, energy, is, consumed, by, the, thermal, expansion, of, the, initially, degenerate, core, and, thus, cannot, be, seen, from, outside, the, star, due, to, the, expansion, of, the, core, the, hydrogen, fusion, in, the, overlying, layers, slows, and, total, energy, generation, decreases, the, star, contracts, although, not, all, the, way, to, the, main, sequence, and, it, migrates, to, the, horizontal, branch, on, the, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, gradually, shrinking, in, radius, and, increasing, its, surface, temperature, core, helium, flash, stars, evolve, to, the, red, end, of, the, horizontal, branch, but, do, not, migrate, to, higher, temperatures, before, they, gain, a, degenerate, carbon, oxygen, core, and, start, helium, shell, burning, these, stars, are, often, observed, as, a, red, clump, of, stars, in, the, colour, magnitude, diagram, of, a, cluster, hotter, and, less, luminous, than, the, red, giants, higher, mass, stars, with, larger, helium, cores, move, along, the, horizontal, branch, to, higher, temperatures, some, becoming, unstable, pulsating, stars, in, the, yellow, instability, strip, rr, lyrae, variables, whereas, some, become, even, hotter, and, can, form, a, blue, tail, or, blue, hook, to, the, horizontal, branch, the, morphology, of, the, horizontal, branch, depends, on, parameters, such, as, metallicity, age, and, helium, content, but, the, exact, details, are, still, being, modelled, after, a, star, has, consumed, the, helium, at, the, core, hydrogen, and, helium, fusion, continues, in, shells, around, a, hot, core, of, carbon, and, oxygen, the, star, follows, the, asymptotic, giant, branch, on, the, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, paralleling, the, original, red, giant, evolution, but, with, even, faster, energy, generation, which, lasts, for, a, shorter, time, although, helium, is, being, burnt, in, a, shell, the, majority, of, the, energy, is, produced, by, hydrogen, burning, in, a, shell, further, from, the, core, of, the, star, helium, from, these, hydrogen, burning, shells, drops, towards, the, center, of, the, star, and, periodically, the, energy, output, from, the, helium, shell, increases, dramatically, this, is, known, as, a, thermal, pulse, and, they, occur, towards, the, end, of, the, asymptotic, giant, branch, phase, sometimes, even, into, the, post, asymptotic, giant, branch, phase, depending, on, mass, and, composition, there, may, be, several, to, hundreds, of, thermal, pulses, there, is, a, phase, on, the, ascent, of, the, asymptotic, giant, branch, where, a, deep, convective, zone, forms, and, can, bring, carbon, from, the, core, to, the, surface, this, is, known, as, the, second, dredge, up, and, in, some, stars, there, may, even, be, a, third, dredge, up, in, this, way, a, carbon, star, is, formed, very, cool, and, strongly, reddened, stars, showing, strong, carbon, lines, in, their, spectra, a, process, known, as, hot, bottom, burning, may, convert, carbon, into, oxygen, and, nitrogen, before, it, can, be, dredged, to, the, surface, and, the, interaction, between, these, processes, determines, the, observed, luminosities, and, spectra, of, carbon, stars, in, particular, clusters, another, well, known, class, of, asymptotic, giant, branch, stars, is, the, mira, variables, which, pulsate, with, well, defined, periods, of, tens, to, hundreds, of, days, and, large, amplitudes, up, to, about, 10, magnitudes, in, the, visual, total, luminosity, changes, by, a, much, smaller, amount, in, more, massive, stars, the, stars, become, more, luminous, and, the, pulsation, period, is, longer, leading, to, enhanced, mass, loss, and, the, stars, become, heavily, obscured, at, visual, wavelengths, these, stars, can, be, observed, as, oh, ir, stars, pulsating, in, the, infrared, and, showing, oh, maser, activity, these, stars, are, clearly, oxygen, rich, in, contrast, to, the, carbon, stars, but, both, must, be, produced, by, dredge, ups, these, mid, range, stars, ultimately, reach, the, tip, of, the, asymptotic, giant, branch, and, run, out, of, fuel, for, shell, burning, they, are, not, sufficiently, massive, to, start, full, scale, carbon, fusion, so, they, contract, again, going, through, a, period, of, post, asymptotic, giant, branch, superwind, to, produce, a, planetary, nebula, with, an, extremely, hot, central, star, the, central, star, then, cools, to, a, white, dwarf, the, expelled, gas, is, relatively, rich, in, heavy, elements, created, within, the, star, and, may, be, particularly, oxygen, or, carbon, enriched, depending, on, the, type, of, the, star, the, gas, builds, up, in, an, expanding, shell, called, a, circumstellar, envelope, and, cools, as, it, moves, away, from, the, star, allowing, dust, particles, and, molecules, to, form, with, the, high, infrared, energy, input, from, the, central, star, ideal, conditions, are, formed, in, these, circumstellar, envelopes, for, maser, excitation, it, is, possible, for, thermal, pulses, to, be, produced, once, post, asymptotic, giant, branch, evolution, has, begun, producing, a, variety, of, unusual, and, poorly, understood, stars, known, as, born, again, asymptotic, giant, branch, stars, these, may, result, in, extreme, horizontal, branch, stars, subdwarf, b, stars, hydrogen, deficient, post, asymptotic, giant, branch, stars, variable, planetary, nebula, central, stars, and, r, coronae, borealis, variables, in, massive, stars, the, core, is, already, large, enough, at, the, onset, of, the, hydrogen, burning, shell, that, helium, ignition, will, occur, before, electron, degeneracy, pressure, has, a, chance, to, become, prevalent, thus, when, these, stars, expand, and, cool, they, do, not, brighten, as, dramatically, as, lower, mass, stars, however, they, were, more, luminous, on, the, main, sequence, and, they, evolve, to, highly, luminous, supergiants, their, cores, become, massive, enough, that, they, cannot, support, themselves, by, electron, degeneracy, and, will, eventually, collapse, to, produce, a, neutron, star, or, black, hole, extremely, massive, stars, more, than, approximately, 40, m, which, are, very, luminous, and, thus, have, very, rapid, stellar, winds, lose, mass, so, rapidly, due, to, radiation, pressure, that, they, tend, to, strip, off, their, own, envelopes, before, they, can, expand, to, become, red, supergiants, and, thus, retain, extremely, high, surface, temperatures, and, blue, white, color, from, their, main, sequence, time, onwards, the, largest, stars, of, the, current, generation, are, about, 100, 150, m, because, the, outer, layers, would, be, expelled, by, the, extreme, radiation, although, lower, mass, stars, normally, do, not, burn, off, their, outer, layers, so, rapidly, they, can, likewise, avoid, becoming, red, giants, or, red, supergiants, if, they, are, in, binary, systems, close, enough, so, that, the, companion, star, strips, off, the, envelope, as, it, expands, or, if, they, rotate, rapidly, enough, so, that, convection, extends, all, the, way, from, the, core, to, the, surface, resulting, in, the, absence, of, a, separate, core, and, envelope, due, to, thorough, mixing, the, core, of, a, massive, star, defined, as, the, region, depleted, of, hydrogen, grows, hotter, and, denser, as, it, accretes, material, from, the, fusion, of, hydrogen, outside, the, core, in, sufficiently, massive, stars, the, core, reaches, temperatures, and, densities, high, enough, to, fuse, carbon, and, heavier, elements, via, the, alpha, process, at, the, end, of, helium, fusion, the, core, of, a, star, consists, primarily, of, carbon, and, oxygen, in, stars, heavier, than, about, 8, m, the, carbon, ignites, and, fuses, to, form, neon, sodium, and, magnesium, stars, somewhat, less, massive, may, partially, ignite, carbon, but, they, are, unable, to, fully, fuse, the, carbon, before, electron, degeneracy, sets, in, and, these, stars, will, eventually, leave, an, oxygen, neon, magnesium, white, dwarf, the, exact, mass, limit, for, full, carbon, burning, depends, on, several, factors, such, as, metallicity, and, the, detailed, mass, lost, on, the, asymptotic, giant, branch, but, is, approximately, 8, 9, m, after, carbon, burning, is, complete, the, core, of, these, stars, reaches, about, 2, 5, m, and, becomes, hot, enough, for, heavier, elements, to, fuse, before, oxygen, starts, to, fuse, neon, begins, to, capture, electrons, which, triggers, neon, burning, for, a, range, of, stars, of, approximately, 8, 12, m, this, process, is, unstable, and, creates, runaway, fusion, resulting, in, an, electron, capture, supernova, in, more, massive, stars, the, fusion, of, neon, proceeds, without, a, runaway, deflagration, this, is, followed, in, turn, by, complete, oxygen, burning, and, silicon, burning, producing, a, core, consisting, largely, of, iron, peak, elements, surrounding, the, core, are, shells, of, lighter, elements, still, undergoing, fusion, the, timescale, for, complete, fusion, of, a, carbon, core, to, an, iron, core, is, so, short, just, a, few, hundred, years, that, the, outer, layers, of, the, star, are, unable, to, react, and, the, appearance, of, the, star, is, largely, unchanged, the, iron, core, grows, until, it, reaches, an, effective, chandrasekhar, mass, higher, than, the, formal, chandrasekhar, mass, due, to, various, corrections, for, the, relativistic, effects, entropy, charge, and, the, surrounding, envelope, the, effective, chandrasekhar, mass, for, an, iron, core, varies, from, about, 1, 34, m, in, the, least, massive, red, supergiants, to, more, than, 1, 8, m, in, more, massive, stars, once, this, mass, is, reached, electrons, begin, to, be, captured, into, the, iron, peak, nuclei, and, the, core, becomes, unable, to, support, itself, the, core, collapses, and, the, star, is, destroyed, either, in, a, supernova, or, direct, collapse, to, a, black, hole, when, the, core, of, a, massive, star, collapses, it, will, form, a, neutron, star, or, in, the, case, of, cores, that, exceed, the, tolman, oppenheimer, volkoff, limit, a, black, hole, through, a, process, that, is, not, completely, understood, some, of, the, gravitational, potential, energy, released, by, this, core, collapse, is, converted, into, a, type, ib, type, ic, or, type, ii, supernova, it, is, known, that, the, core, collapse, produces, a, massive, surge, of, neutrinos, as, observed, with, supernova, sn, 1987a, the, extremely, energetic, neutrinos, fragment, some, nuclei, some, of, their, energy, is, consumed, in, releasing, nucleons, including, neutrons, and, some, of, their, energy, is, transformed, into, heat, and, kinetic, energy, thus, augmenting, the, shock, wave, started, by, rebound, of, some, of, the, infalling, material, from, the, collapse, of, the, core, electron, capture, in, very, dense, parts, of, the, infalling, matter, may, produce, additional, neutrons, because, some, of, the, rebounding, matter, is, bombarded, by, the, neutrons, some, of, its, nuclei, capture, them, creating, a, spectrum, of, heavier, than, iron, material, including, the, radioactive, elements, up, to, and, likely, beyond, uranium, although, non, exploding, red, giants, can, produce, significant, quantities, of, elements, heavier, than, iron, using, neutrons, released, in, side, reactions, of, earlier, nuclear, reactions, the, abundance, of, elements, heavier, than, iron, and, in, particular, of, certain, isotopes, of, elements, that, have, multiple, stable, or, long, lived, isotopes, produced, in, such, reactions, is, quite, different, from, that, produced, in, a, supernova, neither, abundance, alone, matches, that, found, in, the, solar, system, so, both, supernovae, and, ejection, of, elements, from, red, giants, are, required, to, explain, the, observed, abundance, of, heavy, elements, and, isotopes, thereof, the, energy, transferred, from, collapse, of, the, core, to, rebounding, material, not, only, generates, heavy, elements, but, provides, for, their, acceleration, well, beyond, escape, velocity, thus, causing, a, type, ib, type, ic, or, type, ii, supernova, current, understanding, of, this, energy, transfer, is, still, not, satisfactory, although, current, computer, models, of, type, ib, type, ic, and, type, ii, supernovae, account, for, part, of, the, energy, transfer, they, are, not, able, to, account, for, enough, energy, transfer, to, produce, the, observed, ejection, of, material, however, neutrino, oscillations, may, play, an, important, role, in, the, energy, transfer, problem, as, they, not, only, affect, the, energy, available, in, a, particular, flavour, of, neutrinos, but, also, through, other, general, relativistic, effects, on, neutrinos, some, evidence, gained, from, analysis, of, the, mass, and, orbital, parameters, of, binary, neutron, stars, which, require, two, such, supernovae, hints, that, the, collapse, of, an, oxygen, neon, magnesium, core, may, produce, a, supernova, that, differs, observably, in, ways, other, than, size, from, a, supernova, produced, by, the, collapse, of, an, iron, core, the, most, massive, stars, that, exist, today, may, be, completely, destroyed, by, a, supernova, with, an, energy, greatly, exceeding, its, gravitational, binding, energy, this, rare, event, caused, by, pair, instability, leaves, behind, no, black, hole, remnant, in, the, past, history, of, the, universe, some, stars, were, even, larger, than, the, largest, that, exists, today, and, they, would, immediately, collapse, into, a, black, hole, at, the, end, of, their, lives, due, to, photodisintegration, after, a, star, has, burned, out, its, fuel, supply, its, remnants, can, take, one, of, three, forms, depending, on, the, mass, during, its, lifetime, for, a, star, of, 1, m, the, resulting, white, dwarf, is, of, about, 0, 6, m, compressed, into, approximately, the, volume, of, the, earth, white, dwarfs, are, stable, because, the, inward, pull, of, gravity, is, balanced, by, the, degeneracy, pressure, of, the, star, s, electrons, a, consequence, of, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, electron, degeneracy, pressure, provides, a, rather, soft, limit, against, further, compression, therefore, for, a, given, chemical, composition, white, dwarfs, of, higher, mass, have, a, smaller, volume, with, no, fuel, left, to, burn, the, star, radiates, its, remaining, heat, into, space, for, billions, of, years, a, white, dwarf, is, very, hot, when, it, first, forms, more, than, 100, 000, k, at, the, surface, and, even, hotter, in, its, interior, it, is, so, hot, that, a, lot, of, its, energy, is, lost, in, the, form, of, neutrinos, for, the, first, 10, million, years, of, its, existence, and, will, have, lost, most, of, its, energy, after, a, billion, years, the, chemical, composition, of, the, white, dwarf, depends, upon, its, mass, a, star, that, has, a, mass, of, about, 8, 12, solar, masses, will, ignite, carbon, fusion, to, form, magnesium, neon, and, smaller, amounts, of, other, elements, resulting, in, a, white, dwarf, composed, chiefly, of, oxygen, neon, and, magnesium, provided, that, it, can, lose, enough, mass, to, get, below, the, chandrasekhar, limit, see, below, and, provided, that, the, ignition, of, carbon, is, not, so, violent, as, to, blow, the, star, apart, in, a, supernova, a, star, of, mass, on, the, order, of, magnitude, of, the, sun, will, be, unable, to, ignite, carbon, fusion, and, will, produce, a, white, dwarf, composed, chiefly, of, carbon, and, oxygen, and, of, mass, too, low, to, collapse, unless, matter, is, added, to, it, later, see, below, a, star, of, less, than, about, half, the, mass, of, the, sun, will, be, unable, to, ignite, helium, fusion, as, noted, earlier, and, will, produce, a, white, dwarf, composed, chiefly, of, helium, in, the, end, all, that, remains, is, a, cold, dark, mass, sometimes, called, a, black, dwarf, however, the, universe, is, not, old, enough, for, any, black, dwarfs, to, exist, yet, if, the, white, dwarf, s, mass, increases, above, the, chandrasekhar, limit, which, is, 1, 4, m, for, a, white, dwarf, composed, chiefly, of, carbon, oxygen, neon, and, or, magnesium, then, electron, degeneracy, pressure, fails, due, to, electron, capture, and, the, star, collapses, depending, upon, the, chemical, composition, and, pre, collapse, temperature, in, the, center, this, will, lead, either, to, collapse, into, a, neutron, star, or, runaway, ignition, of, carbon, and, oxygen, heavier, elements, favor, continued, core, collapse, because, they, require, a, higher, temperature, to, ignite, because, electron, capture, onto, these, elements, and, their, fusion, products, is, easier, higher, core, temperatures, favor, runaway, nuclear, reaction, which, halts, core, collapse, and, leads, to, a, type, ia, supernova, these, supernovae, may, be, many, times, brighter, than, the, type, ii, supernova, marking, the, death, of, a, massive, star, even, though, the, latter, has, the, greater, total, energy, release, this, instability, to, collapse, means, that, no, white, dwarf, more, massive, than, approximately, 1, 4, m, can, exist, with, a, possible, minor, exception, for, very, rapidly, spinning, white, dwarfs, whose, centrifugal, force, due, to, rotation, partially, counteracts, the, weight, of, their, matter, mass, transfer, in, a, binary, system, may, cause, an, initially, stable, white, dwarf, to, surpass, the, chandrasekhar, limit, if, a, white, dwarf, forms, a, close, binary, system, with, another, star, hydrogen, from, the, larger, companion, may, accrete, around, and, onto, a, white, dwarf, until, it, gets, hot, enough, to, fuse, in, a, runaway, reaction, at, its, surface, although, the, white, dwarf, remains, below, the, chandrasekhar, limit, such, an, explosion, is, termed, a, nova, ordinarily, atoms, are, mostly, electron, clouds, by, volume, with, very, compact, nuclei, at, the, center, proportionally, if, atoms, were, the, size, of, a, football, stadium, their, nuclei, would, be, the, size, of, dust, mites, when, a, stellar, core, collapses, the, pressure, causes, electrons, and, protons, to, fuse, by, electron, capture, without, electrons, which, keep, nuclei, apart, the, neutrons, collapse, into, a, dense, ball, in, some, ways, like, a, giant, atomic, nucleus, with, a, thin, overlying, layer, of, degenerate, matter, chiefly, iron, unless, matter, of, different, composition, is, added, later, the, neutrons, resist, further, compression, by, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, in, a, way, analogous, to, electron, degeneracy, pressure, but, stronger, these, stars, known, as, neutron, stars, are, extremely, small, on, the, order, of, radius, 10, km, no, bigger, than, the, size, of, a, large, city, and, are, phenomenally, dense, their, period, of, rotation, shortens, dramatically, as, the, stars, shrink, due, to, conservation, of, angular, momentum, observed, rotational, periods, of, neutron, stars, range, from, about, 1, 5, milliseconds, over, 600, revolutions, per, second, to, several, seconds, when, these, rapidly, rotating, stars, magnetic, poles, are, aligned, with, the, earth, we, detect, a, pulse, of, radiation, each, revolution, such, neutron, stars, are, called, pulsars, and, were, the, first, neutron, stars, to, be, discovered, though, electromagnetic, radiation, detected, from, pulsars, is, most, often, in, the, form, of, radio, waves, pulsars, have, also, been, detected, at, visible, x, ray, and, gamma, ray, wavelengths, if, the, mass, of, the, stellar, remnant, is, high, enough, the, neutron, degeneracy, pressure, will, be, insufficient, to, prevent, collapse, below, the, schwarzschild, radius, the, stellar, remnant, thus, becomes, a, black, hole, the, mass, at, which, this, occurs, is, not, known, with, certainty, but, is, currently, estimated, at, between, 2, and, 3, m, black, holes, are, predicted, by, the, theory, of, general, relativity, according, to, classical, general, relativity, no, matter, or, information, can, flow, from, the, interior, of, a, black, hole, to, an, outside, observer, although, quantum, effects, may, allow, deviations, from, this, strict, rule, the, existence, of, black, holes, in, the, universe, is, well, supported, both, theoretically, and, by, astronomical, observation, because, the, core, collapse, mechanism, of, a, supernova, is, at, present, only, partially, understood, it, is, still, not, known, whether, it, is, possible, for, a, star, to, collapse, directly, to, a, black, hole, without, producing, a, visible, supernova, or, whether, some, supernovae, initially, form, unstable, neutron, stars, which, then, collapse, into, black, holes, the, exact, relation, between, the, initial, mass, of, the, star, and, the, final, remnant, is, also, not, completely, certain, resolution, of, these, uncertainties, requires, the, analysis, of, more, supernovae, and, supernova, remnants, a, stellar, evolutionary, model, is, a, mathematical, model, that, can, be, used, to, compute, the, evolutionary, phases, of, a, star, from, its, formation, until, it, becomes, a, remnant, the, mass, and, chemical, composition, of, the, star, are, used, as, the, inputs, and, the, luminosity, and, surface, temperature, are, the, only, constraints, the, model, formulae, are, based, upon, the, physical, understanding, of, the, star, usually, under, the, assumption, of, hydrostatic, equilibrium, extensive, computer, calculations, are, then, run, to, determine, the, changing, state, of, the, star, over, time, yielding, a, table, of, data, that, can, be, used, to, determine, the, evolutionary, track, of, the, star, across, the, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, along, with, other, evolving, properties, accurate, models, can, be, used, to, estimate, the, current, age, of, a, star, by, comparing, its, physical, properties, with, those, of, stars, along, a, matching, evolutionary, track
