krypton, from, ancient, greek, romanized, kryptos, the, hidden, one, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, kr, and, atomic, number, 36, it, is, a, colorless, odorless, noble, gas, that, occurs, in, trace, amounts, in, the, atmosphere, and, is, often, used, with, other, rare, gases, in, fluorescent, lamps, krypton, is, chemically, inert, krypton, like, the, other, noble, gases, is, used, in, lighting, and, photography, krypton, light, has, many, spectral, lines, and, krypton, plasma, is, useful, in, bright, high, powered, gas, lasers, krypton, ion, and, excimer, lasers, each, of, which, resonates, and, amplifies, a, single, spectral, line, krypton, fluoride, also, makes, a, useful, laser, medium, from, 1960, to, 1983, the, official, definition, of, the, metre, was, based, on, the, wavelength, of, one, spectral, line, of, krypton, 86, because, of, the, high, power, and, relative, ease, of, operation, of, krypton, discharge, tubes, krypton, was, discovered, in, britain, in, 1898, by, william, ramsay, a, scottish, chemist, and, morris, travers, an, english, chemist, in, residue, left, from, evaporating, nearly, all, components, of, liquid, air, neon, was, discovered, by, a, similar, procedure, by, the, same, workers, just, a, few, weeks, later, william, ramsay, was, awarded, the, 1904, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, for, discovery, of, a, series, of, noble, gases, including, krypton, in, 1960, the, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, defined, the, meter, as, 1, 650, 763, 73, wavelengths, of, light, emitted, in, the, vacuum, corresponding, to, the, transition, between, the, 2p, 10, and, 5d, 5, levels, in, the, isotope, krypton, 86, this, agreement, replaced, the, 1889, international, prototype, meter, which, was, a, metal, bar, located, in, s, vres, this, also, made, obsolete, the, 1927, definition, of, the, ngstr, m, based, on, the, red, cadmium, spectral, line, replacing, it, with, 1, 10, 10, m, the, krypton, 86, definition, lasted, until, the, october, 1983, conference, which, redefined, the, meter, as, the, distance, that, light, travels, in, vacuum, during, 1, 299, 792, 458, s, krypton, is, characterized, by, several, sharp, emission, lines, spectral, signatures, the, strongest, being, green, and, yellow, krypton, is, one, of, the, products, of, uranium, fission, solid, krypton, is, white, and, has, a, face, centered, cubic, crystal, structure, which, is, a, common, property, of, all, noble, gases, except, helium, which, has, a, hexagonal, close, packed, crystal, structure, naturally, occurring, krypton, in, earth, s, atmosphere, is, composed, of, five, stable, isotopes, plus, one, isotope, 78, kr, with, such, a, long, half, life, 9, 2, 10, 21, years, that, it, can, be, considered, stable, this, isotope, has, the, third, longest, known, half, life, among, all, isotopes, for, which, decay, has, been, observed, it, undergoes, double, electron, capture, to, 78, se, in, addition, about, thirty, unstable, isotopes, and, isomers, are, known, traces, of, 81, kr, a, cosmogenic, nuclide, produced, by, the, cosmic, ray, irradiation, of, 80, kr, also, occur, in, nature, this, isotope, is, radioactive, with, a, half, life, of, 230, 000, years, krypton, is, highly, volatile, and, does, not, stay, in, solution, in, near, surface, water, but, 81, kr, has, been, used, for, dating, old, 50, 000, 800, 000, years, groundwater, 85, kr, is, an, inert, radioactive, noble, gas, with, a, half, life, of, 10, 76, years, it, is, produced, by, the, fission, of, uranium, and, plutonium, such, as, in, nuclear, bomb, testing, and, nuclear, reactors, 85, kr, is, released, during, the, reprocessing, of, fuel, rods, from, nuclear, reactors, concentrations, at, the, north, pole, are, 30, higher, than, at, the, south, pole, due, to, convective, mixing, like, the, other, noble, gases, krypton, is, chemically, highly, unreactive, the, rather, restricted, chemistry, of, krypton, in, the, 2, oxidation, state, parallels, that, of, the, neighboring, element, bromine, in, the, 1, oxidation, state, due, to, the, scandide, contraction, it, is, difficult, to, oxidize, the, 4p, elements, to, their, group, oxidation, states, until, the, 1960s, no, noble, gas, compounds, had, been, synthesized, following, the, first, successful, synthesis, of, xenon, compounds, in, 1962, synthesis, of, krypton, difluoride, krf, 2, was, reported, in, 1963, in, the, same, year, krf, 4, was, reported, by, grosse, et, al, but, was, subsequently, shown, to, be, a, mistaken, identification, under, extreme, conditions, krypton, reacts, with, fluorine, to, form, krf, 2, according, to, the, following, equation, krypton, gas, in, a, krypton, fluoride, laser, absorbs, energy, from, a, source, causing, the, krypton, to, react, with, fluorine, gas, producing, the, exciplex, krypton, fluoride, a, temporary, complex, in, an, excited, energy, state, the, complex, can, undergo, spontaneous, or, stimulated, emission, reducing, its, energy, state, to, a, metastable, but, highly, repulsive, ground, state, the, ground, state, complex, quickly, dissociates, into, unbound, atoms, the, result, is, an, exciplex, laser, which, radiates, energy, at, 248, nm, near, the, ultraviolet, portion, of, the, spectrum, corresponding, with, the, energy, difference, between, the, ground, state, and, the, excited, state, of, the, complex, compounds, with, krypton, bonded, to, atoms, other, than, fluorine, have, also, been, discovered, there, are, also, unverified, reports, of, a, barium, salt, of, a, krypton, oxoacid, ar, kr, and, kr, h, polyatomic, ions, have, been, investigated, and, there, is, evidence, for, kr, xe, or, krxe, the, reaction, of, krf, 2, with, b, otef, 5, 3, produces, an, unstable, compound, kr, otef, 5, 2, that, contains, a, krypton, oxygen, bond, a, krypton, nitrogen, bond, is, found, in, the, cation, produced, by, the, reaction, of, krf, 2, with, below, 50, c, hkrcn, and, hkrc, ch, krypton, hydride, cyanide, and, hydrokryptoacetylene, were, reported, to, be, stable, up, to, 40, k, krypton, hydride, kr, h, 2, 4, crystals, can, be, grown, at, pressures, above, 5, gpa, they, have, a, face, centered, cubic, structure, where, krypton, octahedra, are, surrounded, by, randomly, oriented, hydrogen, molecules, earth, has, retained, all, of, the, noble, gases, that, were, present, at, its, formation, except, helium, krypton, s, concentration, in, the, atmosphere, is, about, 1, ppm, it, can, be, extracted, from, liquid, air, by, fractional, distillation, the, amount, of, krypton, in, space, is, uncertain, because, measurement, is, derived, from, meteoric, activity, and, solar, winds, the, first, measurements, suggest, an, abundance, of, krypton, in, space, krypton, s, multiple, emission, lines, make, ionized, krypton, gas, discharges, appear, whitish, which, in, turn, makes, krypton, based, bulbs, useful, in, photography, as, a, white, light, source, krypton, is, used, in, some, photographic, flashes, for, high, speed, photography, krypton, gas, is, also, combined, with, mercury, to, make, luminous, signs, that, glow, with, a, bright, greenish, blue, light, krypton, is, mixed, with, argon, in, energy, efficient, fluorescent, lamps, reducing, the, power, consumption, but, also, reducing, the, light, output, and, raising, the, cost, krypton, costs, about, 100, times, as, much, as, argon, krypton, along, with, xenon, is, also, used, to, fill, incandescent, lamps, to, reduce, filament, evaporation, and, allow, higher, operating, temperatures, krypton, s, white, discharge, is, sometimes, used, as, an, artistic, effect, in, gas, discharge, neon, tubes, krypton, produces, much, higher, light, power, than, neon, in, the, red, spectral, line, region, and, for, this, reason, red, lasers, for, high, power, laser, light, shows, are, often, krypton, lasers, with, mirrors, that, select, the, red, spectral, line, for, laser, amplification, and, emission, rather, than, the, more, familiar, helium, neon, variety, which, could, not, achieve, the, same, multi, watt, outputs, the, krypton, fluoride, laser, is, important, in, nuclear, fusion, energy, research, in, confinement, experiments, the, laser, has, high, beam, uniformity, short, wavelength, and, the, spot, size, can, be, varied, to, track, an, imploding, pellet, in, experimental, particle, physics, liquid, krypton, is, used, to, construct, quasi, homogeneous, electromagnetic, calorimeters, a, notable, example, is, the, calorimeter, of, the, na48, experiment, at, cern, containing, about, 27, tonnes, of, liquid, krypton, this, usage, is, rare, since, liquid, argon, is, less, expensive, the, advantage, of, krypton, is, a, smaller, moli, re, radius, of, 4, 7, cm, which, provides, excellent, spatial, resolution, with, little, overlapping, the, other, parameters, relevant, for, calorimetry, are, radiation, length, of, x, 0, 4, 7, cm, and, density, of, 2, 4, g, cm, 3, krypton, 83, has, application, in, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, for, imaging, airways, in, particular, it, enables, the, radiologist, to, distinguish, between, hydrophobic, and, hydrophilic, surfaces, containing, an, airway, although, xenon, has, potential, for, use, in, computed, tomography, ct, to, assess, regional, ventilation, its, anesthetic, properties, limit, its, fraction, in, the, breathing, gas, to, 35, a, breathing, mixture, of, 30, xenon, and, 30, krypton, is, comparable, in, effectiveness, for, ct, to, a, 40, xenon, fraction, while, avoiding, the, unwanted, effects, of, a, high, partial, pressure, of, xenon, gas, the, metastable, isotope, krypton, 81m, is, used, in, nuclear, medicine, for, lung, ventilation, perfusion, scans, where, it, is, inhaled, and, imaged, with, a, gamma, camera, krypton, 85, in, the, atmosphere, has, been, used, to, detect, clandestine, nuclear, fuel, reprocessing, facilities, in, north, korea, and, pakistan, those, facilities, were, detected, in, the, early, 2000s, and, were, believed, to, be, producing, weapons, grade, plutonium, krypton, 85, is, a, medium, lived, fission, product, and, thus, escapes, from, spent, fuel, when, the, cladding, is, removed, krypton, is, used, occasionally, as, an, insulating, gas, between, window, panes, spacex, starlink, uses, krypton, as, a, propellant, for, their, electric, propulsion, system, krypton, is, considered, to, be, a, non, toxic, asphyxiant, being, lipophilic, krypton, has, a, significant, anaesthetic, effect, although, the, mechanism, of, this, phenomenon, is, still, not, fully, clear, there, is, good, evidence, that, the, two, properties, are, mechanistically, related, with, narcotic, potency, seven, times, greater, than, air, and, breathing, an, atmosphere, of, 50, krypton, and, 50, natural, air, as, might, happen, in, the, locality, of, a, leak, causes, narcosis, in, humans, similar, to, breathing, air, at, four, times, atmospheric, pressure, this, is, comparable, to, scuba, diving, at, a, depth, of, 30, m, 100, ft, and, could, affect, anyone, breathing, it, helium, he, atomic, number, 2, atomic, weight, 4, 002602,
