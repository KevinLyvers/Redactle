in, organic, chemistry, an, alkane, or, paraffin, a, historical, trivial, name, that, also, has, other, meanings, is, an, acyclic, saturated, hydrocarbon, in, other, words, an, alkane, consists, of, hydrogen, and, carbon, atoms, arranged, in, a, tree, structure, in, which, all, the, carbon, carbon, bonds, are, single, alkanes, have, the, general, chemical, formula, c, n, h, 2, n, 2, the, alkanes, range, in, complexity, from, the, simplest, case, of, methane, ch, 4, where, n, 1, sometimes, called, the, parent, molecule, to, arbitrarily, large, and, complex, molecules, like, pentacontane, c, 50, h, 102, or, 6, ethyl, 2, methyl, 5, 1, methylethyl, octane, an, isomer, of, tetradecane, c, 14, h, 30, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, iupac, defines, alkanes, as, acyclic, branched, or, unbranched, hydrocarbons, having, the, general, formula, c, n, h, 2, n, 2, and, therefore, consisting, entirely, of, hydrogen, atoms, and, saturated, carbon, atoms, however, some, sources, use, the, term, to, denote, any, saturated, hydrocarbon, including, those, that, are, either, monocyclic, i, e, the, cycloalkanes, or, polycyclic, despite, them, having, a, distinct, general, formula, e, g, cycloalkanes, are, c, n, h, 2, n, in, an, alkane, each, carbon, atom, is, sp, 3, hybridized, with, 4, sigma, bonds, either, c, c, or, c, h, and, each, hydrogen, atom, is, joined, to, one, of, the, carbon, atoms, in, a, c, h, bond, the, longest, series, of, linked, carbon, atoms, in, a, molecule, is, known, as, its, carbon, skeleton, or, carbon, backbone, the, number, of, carbon, atoms, may, be, considered, as, the, size, of, the, alkane, one, group, of, the, higher, alkanes, are, waxes, solids, at, standard, ambient, temperature, and, pressure, satp, for, which, the, number, of, carbon, atoms, in, the, carbon, backbone, is, greater, than, about, 17, with, their, repeated, ch, 2, units, the, alkanes, constitute, a, homologous, series, of, organic, compounds, in, which, the, members, differ, in, molecular, mass, by, multiples, of, 14, 03, u, the, total, mass, of, each, such, methylene, bridge, unit, which, comprises, a, single, carbon, atom, of, mass, 12, 01, u, and, two, hydrogen, atoms, of, mass, 1, 01, u, each, methane, is, produced, by, methanogenic, bacteria, and, some, long, chain, alkanes, function, as, pheromones, in, certain, animal, species, or, as, protective, waxes, in, plants, and, fungi, nevertheless, most, alkanes, do, not, have, much, biological, activity, they, can, be, viewed, as, molecular, trees, upon, which, can, be, hung, the, more, active, reactive, functional, groups, of, biological, molecules, the, alkanes, have, two, main, commercial, sources, petroleum, crude, oil, and, natural, gas, an, alkyl, group, is, an, alkane, based, molecular, fragment, that, bears, one, open, valence, for, bonding, they, are, generally, abbreviated, with, the, symbol, for, any, organyl, group, r, although, alk, is, sometimes, used, to, specifically, symbolize, an, alkyl, group, as, opposed, to, an, alkenyl, group, or, aryl, group, ordinarily, the, c, c, single, bond, distance, is, 1, 53, ngstr, ms, 1, 53, 10, 10, m, saturated, hydrocarbons, can, be, linear, branched, or, cyclic, the, third, group, is, sometimes, called, cycloalkanes, very, complicated, structures, are, possible, by, combining, linear, branch, cyclic, alkanes, alkanes, with, more, than, three, carbon, atoms, can, be, arranged, in, various, ways, forming, structural, isomers, the, simplest, isomer, of, an, alkane, is, the, one, in, which, the, carbon, atoms, are, arranged, in, a, single, chain, with, no, branches, this, isomer, is, sometimes, called, the, n, isomer, n, for, normal, although, it, is, not, necessarily, the, most, common, however, the, chain, of, carbon, atoms, may, also, be, branched, at, one, or, more, points, the, number, of, possible, isomers, increases, rapidly, with, the, number, of, carbon, atoms, for, example, for, acyclic, alkanes, branched, alkanes, can, be, chiral, for, example, 3, methylhexane, and, its, higher, homologues, are, chiral, due, to, their, stereogenic, center, at, carbon, atom, number, 3, the, above, list, only, includes, differences, of, connectivity, not, stereochemistry, in, addition, to, the, alkane, isomers, the, chain, of, carbon, atoms, may, form, one, or, more, rings, such, compounds, are, called, cycloalkanes, and, are, also, excluded, from, the, above, list, because, changing, the, number, of, rings, changes, the, molecular, formula, for, example, cyclobutane, and, methylcyclopropane, are, isomers, of, each, other, c, 4, h, 8, but, are, not, isomers, of, butane, c, 4, h, 10, branched, alkanes, are, more, thermodynamically, stable, than, their, linear, or, less, branched, isomers, for, example, the, highly, branched, 2, 2, 3, 3, tetramethylbutane, is, about, 1, 9, kcal, mol, more, stable, than, its, linear, isomer, n, octane, the, iupac, nomenclature, systematic, way, of, naming, compounds, for, alkanes, is, based, on, identifying, hydrocarbon, chains, unbranched, saturated, hydrocarbon, chains, are, named, systematically, with, a, greek, numerical, prefix, denoting, the, number, of, carbons, and, the, suffix, ane, in, 1866, august, wilhelm, von, hofmann, suggested, systematizing, nomenclature, by, using, the, whole, sequence, of, vowels, a, e, i, o, and, u, to, create, suffixes, ane, ene, ine, or, yne, one, une, for, the, hydrocarbons, c, n, h, 2, n, 2, c, n, h, 2, n, c, n, h, 2, n, 2, c, n, h, 2, n, 4, c, n, h, 2, n, 6, in, modern, nomenclature, the, first, three, specifically, name, hydrocarbons, with, single, double, and, triple, bonds, while, one, now, represents, a, ketone, straight, chain, alkanes, are, sometimes, indicated, by, the, prefix, n, or, n, for, normal, where, a, non, linear, isomer, exists, although, this, is, not, strictly, necessary, and, is, not, part, of, the, iupac, naming, system, the, usage, is, still, common, in, cases, where, one, wishes, to, emphasize, or, distinguish, between, the, straight, chain, and, branched, chain, isomers, e, g, n, butane, rather, than, simply, butane, to, differentiate, it, from, isobutane, alternative, names, for, this, group, used, in, the, petroleum, industry, are, linear, paraffins, or, n, paraffins, the, first, eight, members, of, the, series, in, terms, of, number, of, carbon, atoms, are, named, as, follows, the, first, four, names, were, derived, from, methanol, ether, propionic, acid, and, butyric, acid, alkanes, with, five, or, more, carbon, atoms, are, named, by, adding, the, suffix, ane, to, the, appropriate, numerical, multiplier, prefix, with, elision, of, any, terminal, vowel, a, or, o, from, the, basic, numerical, term, hence, pentane, c, 5, h, 12, hexane, c, 6, h, 14, heptane, c, 7, h, 16, octane, c, 8, h, 18, etc, the, numeral, prefix, is, generally, greek, however, alkanes, with, a, carbon, atom, count, ending, in, nine, for, example, nonane, use, the, latin, prefix, non, simple, branched, alkanes, often, have, a, common, name, using, a, prefix, to, distinguish, them, from, linear, alkanes, for, example, n, pentane, isopentane, and, neopentane, iupac, naming, conventions, can, be, used, to, produce, a, systematic, name, the, key, steps, in, the, naming, of, more, complicated, branched, alkanes, are, as, follows, though, technically, distinct, from, the, alkanes, this, class, of, hydrocarbons, is, referred, to, by, some, as, the, cyclic, alkanes, as, their, description, implies, they, contain, one, or, more, rings, simple, cycloalkanes, have, a, prefix, cyclo, to, distinguish, them, from, alkanes, cycloalkanes, are, named, as, per, their, acyclic, counterparts, with, respect, to, the, number, of, carbon, atoms, in, their, backbones, e, g, cyclopentane, c, 5, h, 10, is, a, cycloalkane, with, 5, carbon, atoms, just, like, pentane, c, 5, h, 12, but, they, are, joined, up, in, a, five, membered, ring, in, a, similar, manner, propane, and, cyclopropane, butane, and, cyclobutane, etc, substituted, cycloalkanes, are, named, similarly, to, substituted, alkanes, the, cycloalkane, ring, is, stated, and, the, substituents, are, according, to, their, position, on, the, ring, with, the, numbering, decided, by, the, cahn, ingold, prelog, priority, rules, the, trivial, non, systematic, name, for, alkanes, is, paraffins, together, alkanes, are, known, as, the, paraffin, series, trivial, names, for, compounds, are, usually, historical, artifacts, they, were, coined, before, the, development, of, systematic, names, and, have, been, retained, due, to, familiar, usage, in, industry, cycloalkanes, are, also, called, naphthenes, branched, chain, alkanes, are, called, isoparaffins, paraffin, is, a, general, term, and, often, does, not, distinguish, between, pure, compounds, and, mixtures, of, isomers, i, e, compounds, of, the, same, chemical, formula, e, g, pentane, and, isopentane, the, following, trivial, names, are, retained, in, the, iupac, system, some, non, iupac, trivial, names, are, occasionally, used, all, alkanes, are, colorless, alkanes, with, the, lowest, molecular, weights, are, gases, those, of, intermediate, molecular, weight, are, liquids, and, the, heaviest, are, waxy, solids, alkanes, experience, intermolecular, van, der, waals, forces, the, cumulative, effects, of, these, intermolecular, forces, give, rise, to, greater, boiling, points, of, alkanes, two, factors, influence, the, strength, of, the, van, der, waals, forces, under, standard, conditions, from, ch, 4, to, c, 4, h, 10, alkanes, are, gaseous, from, c, 5, h, 12, to, c, 17, h, 36, they, are, liquids, and, after, c, 18, h, 38, they, are, solids, as, the, boiling, point, of, alkanes, is, primarily, determined, by, weight, it, should, not, be, a, surprise, that, the, boiling, point, has, an, almost, linear, relationship, with, the, size, molecular, weight, of, the, molecule, as, a, rule, of, thumb, the, boiling, point, rises, 20, 30, c, for, each, carbon, added, to, the, chain, this, rule, applies, to, other, homologous, series, a, straight, chain, alkane, will, have, a, boiling, point, higher, than, a, branched, chain, alkane, due, to, the, greater, surface, area, in, contact, and, thus, greater, van, der, waals, forces, between, adjacent, molecules, for, example, compare, isobutane, 2, methylpropane, and, n, butane, butane, which, boil, at, 12, and, 0, c, and, 2, 2, dimethylbutane, and, 2, 3, dimethylbutane, which, boil, at, 50, and, 58, c, respectively, on, the, other, hand, cycloalkanes, tend, to, have, higher, boiling, points, than, their, linear, counterparts, due, to, the, locked, conformations, of, the, molecules, which, give, a, plane, of, intermolecular, contact, the, melting, points, of, the, alkanes, follow, a, similar, trend, to, boiling, points, for, the, same, reason, as, outlined, above, that, is, all, other, things, being, equal, the, larger, the, molecule, the, higher, the, melting, point, there, is, one, significant, difference, between, boiling, points, and, melting, points, solids, have, a, more, rigid, and, fixed, structure, than, liquids, this, rigid, structure, requires, energy, to, break, down, thus, the, better, put, together, solid, structures, will, require, more, energy, to, break, apart, for, alkanes, this, can, be, seen, from, the, graph, above, i, e, the, blue, line, the, odd, numbered, alkanes, have, a, lower, trend, in, melting, points, than, even, numbered, alkanes, this, is, because, even, numbered, alkanes, pack, well, in, the, solid, phase, forming, a, well, organized, structure, which, requires, more, energy, to, break, apart, the, odd, numbered, alkanes, pack, less, well, and, so, the, looser, organized, solid, packing, structure, requires, less, energy, to, break, apart, for, a, visualization, of, the, crystal, structures, see, the, melting, points, of, branched, chain, alkanes, can, be, either, higher, or, lower, than, those, of, the, corresponding, straight, chain, alkanes, again, depending, on, the, ability, of, the, alkane, in, question, to, pack, well, in, the, solid, phase, alkanes, do, not, conduct, electricity, in, any, way, nor, are, they, substantially, polarized, by, an, electric, field, for, this, reason, they, do, not, form, hydrogen, bonds, and, are, insoluble, in, polar, solvents, such, as, water, since, the, hydrogen, bonds, between, individual, water, molecules, are, aligned, away, from, an, alkane, molecule, the, coexistence, of, an, alkane, and, water, leads, to, an, increase, in, molecular, order, a, reduction, in, entropy, as, there, is, no, significant, bonding, between, water, molecules, and, alkane, molecules, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, suggests, that, this, reduction, in, entropy, should, be, minimized, by, minimizing, the, contact, between, alkane, and, water, alkanes, are, said, to, be, hydrophobic, as, they, are, insoluble, in, water, their, solubility, in, nonpolar, solvents, is, relatively, high, a, property, that, is, called, lipophilicity, alkanes, are, for, example, miscible, in, all, proportions, among, themselves, the, density, of, the, alkanes, usually, increases, with, the, number, of, carbon, atoms, but, remains, less, than, that, of, water, hence, alkanes, form, the, upper, layer, in, an, alkane, water, mixture, the, molecular, structure, of, the, alkanes, directly, affects, their, physical, and, chemical, characteristics, it, is, derived, from, the, electron, configuration, of, carbon, which, has, four, valence, electrons, the, carbon, atoms, in, alkanes, are, described, as, sp, 3, hybrids, that, is, to, say, that, to, a, good, approximation, the, valence, electrons, are, in, orbitals, directed, towards, the, corners, of, a, tetrahedron, which, are, derived, from, the, combination, of, the, 2s, orbital, and, the, three, 2p, orbitals, geometrically, the, angle, between, the, bonds, are, cos, 1, 1, 3, 109, 47, this, is, exact, for, the, case, of, methane, while, larger, alkanes, containing, a, combination, of, c, h, and, c, c, bonds, generally, have, bonds, that, are, within, several, degrees, of, this, idealized, value, an, alkane, has, only, c, h, and, c, c, single, bonds, the, former, result, from, the, overlap, of, an, sp, 3, orbital, of, carbon, with, the, 1s, orbital, of, a, hydrogen, the, latter, by, the, overlap, of, two, sp, 3, orbitals, on, adjacent, carbon, atoms, the, bond, lengths, amount, to, 1, 09, 10, 10, m, for, a, c, h, bond, and, 1, 54, 10, 10, m, for, a, c, c, bond, the, spatial, arrangement, of, the, bonds, is, similar, to, that, of, the, four, sp, 3, orbitals, they, are, tetrahedrally, arranged, with, an, angle, of, 109, 47, between, them, structural, formulae, that, represent, the, bonds, as, being, at, right, angles, to, one, another, while, both, common, and, useful, do, not, accurately, depict, the, geometry, the, spatial, arrangement, of, the, c, c, and, c, h, bonds, are, described, by, the, torsion, angles, of, the, molecule, is, known, as, its, conformation, in, ethane, the, simplest, case, for, studying, the, conformation, of, alkanes, there, is, nearly, free, rotation, about, a, carbon, carbon, single, bond, two, limiting, conformations, are, important, eclipsed, conformation, and, staggered, conformation, the, staggered, conformation, is, 12, 6, kj, mol, 3, 0, kcal, mol, lower, in, energy, more, stable, than, the, eclipsed, conformation, the, least, stable, in, highly, branched, alkanes, the, bond, angle, may, differ, from, the, optimal, value, 109, 5, to, accommodate, bulky, groups, such, distortions, introduce, a, tension, in, the, molecule, known, as, steric, hindrance, or, strain, strain, substantially, increases, reactivity, spectroscopic, signatures, for, alkanes, are, obtainable, by, the, major, characterization, techniques, the, c, h, stretching, mode, gives, a, strong, absorptions, between, 2850, and, 2960, cm, 1, and, weaker, bands, for, the, c, c, stretching, mode, absorbs, between, 800, and, 1300, cm, 1, the, carbon, hydrogen, bending, modes, depend, on, the, nature, of, the, group, methyl, groups, show, bands, at, 1450, cm, 1, and, 1375, cm, 1, while, methylene, groups, show, bands, at, 1465, cm, 1, and, 1450, cm, 1, carbon, chains, with, more, than, four, carbon, atoms, show, a, weak, absorption, at, around, 725, cm, 1, the, proton, resonances, of, alkanes, are, usually, found, at, h, 0, 5, 1, 5, the, carbon, 13, resonances, depend, on, the, number, of, hydrogen, atoms, attached, to, the, carbon, c, 8, 30, primary, methyl, ch, 3, 15, 55, secondary, methylene, ch, 2, 20, 60, tertiary, methyne, c, h, and, quaternary, the, carbon, 13, resonance, of, quaternary, carbon, atoms, is, characteristically, weak, due, to, the, lack, of, nuclear, overhauser, effect, and, the, long, relaxation, time, and, can, be, missed, in, weak, samples, or, samples, that, have, not, been, run, for, a, sufficiently, long, time, since, alkanes, have, high, ionization, energies, their, electron, impact, mass, spectra, show, weak, currents, for, their, molecular, ions, the, fragmentation, pattern, can, be, difficult, to, interpret, but, in, the, case, of, branched, chain, alkanes, the, carbon, chain, is, preferentially, cleaved, at, tertiary, or, quaternary, carbons, due, to, the, relative, stability, of, the, resulting, free, radicals, the, mass, spectra, for, straight, chain, alkanes, is, illustrated, by, that, for, dodecane, the, fragment, resulting, from, the, loss, of, a, single, methyl, group, m, 15, is, absent, fragments, are, more, intense, than, the, molecular, ion, and, are, spaced, by, intervals, of, 14, mass, units, corresponding, to, loss, of, ch, 2, groups, alkanes, are, only, weakly, reactive, with, most, chemical, compounds, they, only, reacts, with, the, strongest, of, electrophilic, reagents, by, virtue, of, their, strong, c, h, bonds, 100, kcal, mol, and, c, c, bonds, 90, kcal, mol, they, are, also, relatively, unreactive, toward, free, radicals, this, inertness, is, the, source, of, the, term, paraffins, with, the, meaning, here, of, lacking, affinity, in, crude, oil, the, alkane, molecules, have, remained, chemically, unchanged, for, millions, of, years, the, acid, dissociation, constant, p, k, a, values, of, all, alkanes, are, estimated, to, range, from, 50, to, 70, depending, on, the, extrapolation, method, hence, they, are, extremely, weak, acids, that, are, practically, inert, to, bases, see, carbon, acids, they, are, also, extremely, weak, bases, undergoing, no, observable, protonation, in, pure, sulfuric, acid, h, 0, 12, although, superacids, that, are, at, least, millions, of, times, stronger, have, been, known, to, protonate, them, to, give, hypercoordinate, alkanium, ions, see, methanium, ion, thus, a, mixture, of, antimony, pentafluoride, sbf, 5, and, fluorosulfonic, acid, hso, 3, f, called, magic, acid, can, protonate, alkanes, all, alkanes, react, with, oxygen, in, a, combustion, reaction, although, they, become, increasingly, difficult, to, ignite, as, the, number, of, carbon, atoms, increases, the, general, equation, for, complete, combustion, is, in, the, absence, of, sufficient, oxygen, carbon, monoxide, or, even, soot, can, be, formed, as, shown, below, for, example, methane, see, the, alkane, heat, of, formation, table, for, detailed, data, the, standard, enthalpy, change, of, combustion, c, h, for, alkanes, increases, by, about, 650, kj, mol, per, ch, 2, group, branched, chain, alkanes, have, lower, values, of, c, h, than, straight, chain, alkanes, of, the, same, number, of, carbon, atoms, and, so, can, be, seen, to, be, somewhat, more, stable, some, organisms, are, capable, of, metalbolizing, alkanes, the, methane, monooxygenases, convert, methane, to, methanol, for, higher, alkanes, cytochrome, p450, convert, alkanes, to, alcohols, which, are, then, susceptible, to, degradation, free, radicals, molecules, with, unpaired, electrons, play, a, large, role, in, most, reactions, of, alkanes, free, radical, halogenation, reactions, occur, with, halogens, leading, to, the, production, of, haloalkanes, the, hydrogen, atoms, of, the, alkane, are, progressively, replaced, by, halogen, atoms, the, reaction, of, alkanes, and, fluorine, is, highly, exothermic, and, can, lead, to, an, explosion, these, reactions, are, an, important, industrial, route, to, halogenated, hydrocarbons, there, are, three, steps, experiments, have, shown, that, all, halogenation, produces, a, mixture, of, all, possible, isomers, indicating, that, all, hydrogen, atoms, are, susceptible, to, reaction, the, mixture, produced, however, is, not, statistical, secondary, and, tertiary, hydrogen, atoms, are, preferentially, replaced, due, to, the, greater, stability, of, secondary, and, tertiary, free, radicals, an, example, can, be, seen, in, the, monobromination, of, propane, in, the, reed, reaction, sulfur, dioxide, and, chlorine, convert, hydrocarbons, to, sulfonyl, chlorides, under, the, influence, of, light, under, some, conditions, alkanes, will, undergo, nitration, certain, transition, metal, complexes, promote, non, radical, reactions, with, alkanes, resulting, in, so, c, h, bond, activation, reactions, cracking, breaks, larger, molecules, into, smaller, ones, this, reaction, requires, heat, and, catalysts, the, thermal, cracking, process, follows, a, homolytic, mechanism, with, formation, of, free, radicals, the, catalytic, cracking, process, involves, the, presence, of, acid, catalysts, usually, solid, acids, such, as, silica, alumina, and, zeolites, which, promote, a, heterolytic, asymmetric, breakage, of, bonds, yielding, pairs, of, ions, of, opposite, charges, usually, a, carbocation, carbon, localized, free, radicals, and, cations, are, both, highly, unstable, and, undergo, processes, of, chain, rearrangement, c, c, scission, in, position, beta, i, e, cracking, and, intra, and, intermolecular, hydrogen, transfer, or, hydride, transfer, in, both, types, of, processes, the, corresponding, reactive, intermediates, radicals, ions, are, permanently, regenerated, and, thus, they, proceed, by, a, self, propagating, chain, mechanism, the, chain, of, reactions, is, eventually, terminated, by, radical, or, ion, recombination, dragan, and, his, colleague, were, the, first, to, report, about, isomerization, in, alkanes, isomerization, and, reformation, are, processes, in, which, straight, chain, alkanes, are, heated, in, the, presence, of, a, platinum, catalyst, in, isomerization, the, alkanes, become, branched, chain, isomers, in, other, words, it, does, not, lose, any, carbons, or, hydrogens, keeping, the, same, molecular, weight, in, reformation, the, alkanes, become, cycloalkanes, or, aromatic, hydrocarbons, giving, off, hydrogen, as, a, by, product, both, of, these, processes, raise, the, octane, number, of, the, substance, butane, is, the, most, common, alkane, that, is, put, under, the, process, of, isomerization, as, it, makes, many, branched, alkanes, with, high, octane, numbers, in, steam, reforming, alkanes, react, with, steam, in, the, presence, of, a, nickel, catalyst, to, give, hydrogen, and, carbon, monoxide, alkanes, form, a, small, portion, of, the, atmospheres, of, the, outer, gas, planets, such, as, jupiter, 0, 1, methane, 2, ppm, ethane, saturn, 0, 2, methane, 5, ppm, ethane, uranus, 1, 99, methane, 2, 5, ppm, ethane, and, neptune, 1, 5, methane, 1, 5, ppm, ethane, titan, 1, 6, methane, a, satellite, of, saturn, was, examined, by, the, huygens, probe, which, indicated, that, titan, s, atmosphere, periodically, rains, liquid, methane, onto, the, moon, s, surface, also, on, titan, the, cassini, mission, has, imaged, seasonal, methane, ethane, lakes, near, the, polar, regions, of, titan, methane, and, ethane, have, also, been, detected, in, the, tail, of, the, comet, hyakutake, chemical, analysis, showed, that, the, abundances, of, ethane, and, methane, were, roughly, equal, which, is, thought, to, imply, that, its, ices, formed, in, interstellar, space, away, from, the, sun, which, would, have, evaporated, these, volatile, molecules, alkanes, have, also, been, detected, in, meteorites, such, as, carbonaceous, chondrites, traces, of, methane, gas, about, 0, 0002, or, 1745, ppb, occur, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, produced, primarily, by, methanogenic, microorganisms, such, as, archaea, in, the, gut, of, ruminants, the, most, important, commercial, sources, for, alkanes, are, natural, gas, and, oil, natural, gas, contains, primarily, methane, and, ethane, with, some, propane, and, butane, oil, is, a, mixture, of, liquid, alkanes, and, other, hydrocarbons, these, hydrocarbons, were, formed, when, marine, animals, and, plants, zooplankton, and, phytoplankton, died, and, sank, to, the, bottom, of, ancient, seas, and, were, covered, with, sediments, in, an, anoxic, environment, and, converted, over, many, millions, of, years, at, high, temperatures, and, high, pressure, to, their, current, form, natural, gas, resulted, thereby, for, example, from, the, following, reaction, these, hydrocarbon, deposits, collected, in, porous, rocks, trapped, beneath, impermeable, cap, rocks, comprise, commercial, oil, fields, they, have, formed, over, millions, of, years, and, once, exhausted, cannot, be, readily, replaced, the, depletion, of, these, hydrocarbons, reserves, is, the, basis, for, what, is, known, as, the, energy, crisis, alkanes, have, a, low, solubility, in, water, so, the, content, in, the, oceans, is, negligible, however, at, high, pressures, and, low, temperatures, such, as, at, the, bottom, of, the, oceans, methane, can, co, crystallize, with, water, to, form, a, solid, methane, clathrate, methane, hydrate, although, this, cannot, be, commercially, exploited, at, the, present, time, the, amount, of, combustible, energy, of, the, known, methane, clathrate, fields, exceeds, the, energy, content, of, all, the, natural, gas, and, oil, deposits, put, together, methane, extracted, from, methane, clathrate, is, therefore, a, candidate, for, future, fuels, aside, from, petroleum, and, natural, gas, alkanes, occur, significantly, in, nature, only, as, methane, which, is, produced, by, some, archaea, by, the, process, of, methanogenesis, these, organisms, are, found, in, the, gut, of, termites, and, cows, the, methane, is, produced, from, carbon, dioxide, or, other, organic, compounds, energy, is, released, by, the, oxidation, of, hydrogen, it, is, probable, that, our, current, deposits, of, natural, gas, were, formed, in, a, similar, way, another, route, to, alkanes, is, hydrogenolysis, which, entails, cleavage, of, c, heteroatom, bonds, using, hydrogen, in, industry, the, main, substrates, are, organonitrogen, and, organosulfur, impurities, i, e, the, heteroatoms, are, n, and, s, the, specific, processes, are, called, hydrodenitrification, and, hydrodesulfurization, hydrogenolysis, can, be, applied, to, the, conversion, of, virtually, any, functional, group, into, hydrocarbons, substrates, include, haloalkanes, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic, acids, etc, both, hydrogenolysis, and, hydrogenation, are, practiced, in, refineries, the, can, be, effected, by, using, lithium, aluminium, hydride, clemmenson, reduction, and, other, specialized, routes, coal, is, a, more, traditional, precursor, to, alkanes, a, wide, range, of, technologies, have, been, intensively, practiced, for, centuries, simply, heating, coal, gives, alkanes, leaving, behind, coke, relevant, technologies, include, the, bergius, process, and, coal, liquifaction, partial, combustion, of, coal, and, related, solid, organic, compounds, generates, carbon, monoxide, which, can, be, hydrogenated, using, the, fischer, tropsch, process, this, technology, allows, the, synthesize, liquid, hydrocarbons, including, alkanes, this, method, is, used, to, produce, substitutes, for, petroleum, distillates, rarely, is, there, any, interest, in, the, synthesis, of, alkanes, since, they, are, usually, commercially, available, and, less, valued, than, virtually, any, precursor, the, best, known, method, is, hydrogenation, of, alkenes, many, c, x, bonds, can, be, converted, to, c, h, bonds, using, lithium, aluminium, hydride, clemmenson, reduction, and, other, specialized, routes, hydrolysis, of, alkyl, grignard, reagents, and, alkyl, lithium, compounds, gives, alkanes, the, dominant, use, of, alkanes, is, as, fuels, propane, and, butane, easily, liquified, gases, are, commonly, known, as, liquified, petroleum, gas, lpg, from, pentane, to, octane, the, alkanes, are, highly, volatile, liquids, they, are, used, as, fuels, in, internal, combustion, engines, as, they, vaporize, easily, on, entry, into, the, combustion, chamber, without, forming, droplets, which, would, impair, the, uniformity, of, the, combustion, branched, chain, alkanes, are, preferred, as, they, are, much, less, prone, to, premature, ignition, which, causes, knocking, than, their, straight, chain, homologues, this, propensity, to, premature, ignition, is, measured, by, the, octane, rating, of, the, fuel, where, 2, 2, 4, trimethylpentane, isooctane, has, an, arbitrary, value, of, 100, and, heptane, has, a, value, of, zero, apart, from, their, use, as, fuels, the, middle, alkanes, are, also, good, solvents, for, nonpolar, substances, alkanes, from, nonane, to, for, instance, hexadecane, an, alkane, with, sixteen, carbon, atoms, are, liquids, of, higher, viscosity, less, and, less, suitable, for, use, in, gasoline, they, form, instead, the, major, part, of, diesel, and, aviation, fuel, diesel, fuels, are, characterized, by, their, cetane, number, cetane, being, an, old, name, for, hexadecane, however, the, higher, melting, points, of, these, alkanes, can, cause, problems, at, low, temperatures, and, in, polar, regions, where, the, fuel, becomes, too, thick, to, flow, correctly, by, the, process, of, cracking, alkanes, can, be, converted, to, alkenes, simple, alkenes, are, precursors, to, polymers, such, as, polyethylene, and, polypropylene, when, the, cracking, is, taken, to, extremes, alkanes, can, be, converted, to, carbon, black, which, is, a, significant, tire, component, chlorination, of, methane, gives, chloromethanes, which, are, used, as, solvents, and, building, blocks, for, complex, compounds, similarly, treatment, of, methane, with, sulfur, gives, carbon, disulfide, still, other, chemicals, are, prepared, by, reaction, with, sulfur, trioxide, and, nitric, oxide, some, light, hydrocarbons, are, used, as, aerosol, sprays, alkanes, from, hexadecane, upwards, form, the, most, important, components, of, fuel, oil, and, lubricating, oil, in, the, latter, function, they, work, at, the, same, time, as, anti, corrosive, agents, as, their, hydrophobic, nature, means, that, water, cannot, reach, the, metal, surface, many, solid, alkanes, find, use, as, paraffin, wax, for, example, in, candles, this, should, not, be, confused, however, with, true, wax, which, consists, primarily, of, esters, alkanes, with, a, chain, length, of, approximately, 35, or, more, carbon, atoms, are, found, in, bitumen, used, for, example, in, road, surfacing, however, the, higher, alkanes, have, little, value, and, are, usually, split, into, lower, alkanes, by, cracking, alkanes, are, highly, flammable, but, they, have, low, toxicities, methane, is, toxicologically, virtually, inert, alkanes, can, be, asphyxiants, and, narcotic
