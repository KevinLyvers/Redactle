capella, is, the, brightest, star, in, the, northern, constellation, of, auriga, it, has, the, bayer, designation, aurigae, which, is, latinised, to, alpha, aurigae, and, abbreviated, alpha, aur, or, aur, capella, is, the, sixth, brightest, star, in, the, night, sky, and, the, third, brightest, in, the, northern, celestial, hemisphere, after, arcturus, and, vega, a, prominent, object, in, the, northern, winter, sky, it, is, circumpolar, to, observers, north, of, 44, n, its, name, meaning, little, goat, in, latin, capella, depicted, the, goat, amalthea, that, suckled, zeus, in, classical, mythology, capella, is, relatively, close, at, 42, 9, light, years, 13, 2, pc, from, the, sun, it, is, one, of, the, brightest, x, ray, sources, in, the, sky, thought, to, come, primarily, from, the, corona, of, capella, aa, although, it, appears, to, be, a, single, star, to, the, naked, eye, capella, is, actually, a, quadruple, star, system, organized, in, two, binary, pairs, made, up, of, the, stars, capella, aa, capella, ab, capella, h, and, capella, l, the, primary, pair, capella, aa, and, capella, ab, are, two, bright, yellow, giant, stars, both, of, which, are, around, 2, 5, times, as, massive, as, the, sun, the, secondary, pair, capella, h, and, capella, l, are, around, 10, 000, astronomical, units, au, from, the, first, and, are, two, faint, small, and, relatively, cool, red, dwarfs, capella, aa, and, capella, ab, have, exhausted, their, core, hydrogen, and, cooled, and, expanded, moving, off, the, main, sequence, they, are, in, a, very, tight, circular, orbit, about, 0, 74, au, apart, and, orbit, each, other, every, 104, days, capella, aa, is, the, cooler, and, more, luminous, of, the, two, with, spectral, class, k0iii, it, is, 78, 7, 4, 2, times, the, sun, s, luminosity, and, 11, 98, 0, 57, times, its, radius, an, aging, red, clump, star, it, is, fusing, helium, to, carbon, and, oxygen, in, its, core, capella, ab, is, slightly, smaller, and, hotter, and, of, spectral, class, g1iii, it, is, 72, 7, 3, 6, times, as, luminous, as, the, sun, and, 8, 83, 0, 33, times, its, radius, it, is, in, the, hertzsprung, gap, corresponding, to, a, brief, subgiant, evolutionary, phase, as, it, expands, and, cools, to, become, a, red, giant, several, other, stars, in, the, same, visual, field, have, been, catalogued, as, companions, but, are, physically, unrelated, aurigae, latinised, to, alpha, aurigae, is, the, star, system, s, bayer, designation, it, also, has, the, flamsteed, designation, 13, aurigae, it, is, listed, in, several, multiple, star, catalogues, as, ads, 3841, ccdm, j05168, 4559, and, wds, j05167, 4600, as, a, relatively, nearby, star, system, capella, is, listed, in, the, gliese, jahreiss, catalogue, with, designations, gj, 194, for, the, bright, pair, of, giants, and, gj, 195, for, the, faint, pair, of, red, dwarfs, the, traditional, name, capella, is, latin, for, small, female, goat, the, alternative, name, capra, was, more, commonly, used, in, classical, times, it, is, the, translation, of, the, greek, star, name, a, aix, meaning, the, goat, as, the, sound, of, the, greek, term, for, the, goat, a, is, similar, to, the, sound, of, the, name, for, the, aegaean, sea, this, star, has, been, used, for, weather, rules, and, determining, the, seasonal, wind, direction, in, 2016, the, international, astronomical, union, organized, a, working, group, on, star, names, wgsn, to, catalogue, and, standardize, proper, names, for, stars, the, wgsn, s, first, bulletin, of, july, 2016, included, a, table, of, the, first, two, batches, of, names, approved, by, the, wgsn, which, included, capella, for, this, star, it, is, now, so, entered, in, the, iau, catalog, of, star, names, the, catalogue, of, star, names, lists, capella, as, applying, to, the, star, aurigae, aa, capella, was, the, brightest, star, in, the, night, sky, from, 210, 000, years, ago, to, 160, 000, years, ago, at, about, 1, 8, in, apparent, magnitude, at, 1, 1, aldebaran, was, brightest, before, this, period, it, and, capella, were, situated, rather, close, to, each, other, in, the, sky, and, approximated, boreal, pole, stars, at, the, time, capella, is, thought, to, be, mentioned, in, an, akkadian, inscription, dating, to, the, 20th, century, bc, its, goat, associated, symbolism, dates, back, to, mesopotamia, as, a, constellation, called, gam, gamlum, or, mul, gam, in, the, 7th, century, bc, document, mul, apin, gam, represented, a, scimitar, or, crook, and, may, have, represented, the, star, alone, or, the, constellation, of, auriga, as, a, whole, later, bedouin, astronomers, created, constellations, that, were, groups, of, animals, where, each, star, represented, one, animal, the, stars, of, auriga, comprised, a, herd, of, goats, an, association, also, present, in, greek, mythology, it, is, sometimes, called, the, shepherd, s, star, in, english, literature, capella, was, seen, as, a, portent, of, rain, in, classical, times, building, j, of, the, pre, columbian, site, monte, alb, n, in, oaxaca, state, in, mexico, was, built, around, 275, bc, at, a, different, orientation, to, other, structures, in, the, complex, its, steps, are, aligned, perpendicular, to, the, rising, of, capella, at, that, time, so, that, a, person, looking, out, a, doorway, on, the, building, would, have, faced, it, directly, capella, is, significant, as, its, heliacal, rising, took, place, within, a, day, of, the, sun, passing, directly, overhead, over, monte, alb, n, professor, william, wallace, campbell, of, the, lick, observatory, announced, that, capella, was, binary, in, 1899, based, on, spectroscopic, observations, he, noted, on, photographic, plates, taken, from, august, 1896, to, february, 1897, that, a, second, spectrum, appeared, superimposed, over, the, first, and, that, there, was, a, doppler, shift, to, violet, in, september, and, october, and, to, red, in, november, and, february, showing, that, the, components, were, moving, toward, and, away, from, the, earth, and, hence, orbiting, each, other, almost, simultaneously, british, astronomer, hugh, newall, had, observed, its, composite, spectrum, with, a, four, prism, spectroscope, attached, to, a, 25, inch, 64, cm, telescope, at, cambridge, in, july, 1899, concluding, that, it, was, a, binary, star, system, many, observers, tried, to, discern, the, component, stars, without, success, known, as, the, interferometrist, s, friend, it, was, first, resolved, interferometrically, in, 1919, by, john, anderson, and, francis, pease, at, mount, wilson, observatory, who, published, an, orbit, in, 1920, based, on, their, observations, this, was, the, first, interferometric, measurement, of, any, object, outside, the, solar, system, a, high, precision, orbit, was, published, in, 1994, based, on, observations, by, the, mark, iii, stellar, interferometer, again, at, mount, wilson, observatory, capella, also, became, the, first, astronomical, object, to, be, imaged, by, a, separate, element, optical, interferometer, when, it, was, imaged, by, the, cambridge, optical, aperture, synthesis, telescope, in, september, 1995, in, 1914, finnish, astronomer, ragnar, furuhjelm, observed, that, the, spectroscopic, binary, had, a, faint, companion, star, which, as, its, proper, motion, was, similar, to, that, of, the, spectroscopic, binary, was, probably, physically, bound, to, it, in, february, 1936, carl, l, stearns, observed, that, this, companion, appeared, to, be, double, itself, this, was, confirmed, in, september, that, year, by, gerard, kuiper, this, pair, are, designated, capella, h, and, l, two, aerobee, hi, rocket, flights, on, september, 20, 1962, and, march, 15, 1963, detected, and, confirmed, an, x, ray, source, in, auriga, at, ra, 05, h, 09, m, dec, 45, identified, as, capella, a, major, milestone, in, stellar, x, ray, astronomy, happened, on, april, 5, 1974, with, the, detection, of, the, strongest, emission, of, x, rays, up, to, that, time, from, capella, measured, at, more, than, 10, 000, times, the, x, ray, luminosity, of, the, sun, a, rocket, flight, on, that, date, briefly, calibrated, its, attitude, control, system, when, a, star, sensor, pointed, the, payload, axis, at, capella, during, this, period, x, rays, in, the, range, 0, 2, 1, 6, kev, were, detected, by, an, x, ray, reflector, system, co, aligned, with, the, star, sensor, the, x, ray, luminosity, l, x, of, 10, 24, w, 10, 31, erg, s, 1, is, four, orders, of, magnitude, above, the, sun, s, x, ray, luminosity, capella, s, x, rays, are, thought, to, be, primarily, from, the, corona, of, the, most, massive, star, capella, is, rosat, x, ray, source, 1rxs, j051642, 2, 460001, the, high, temperature, of, capella, s, corona, as, obtained, from, the, first, coronal, x, ray, spectrum, of, capella, using, heao, 1, would, require, magnetic, confinement, unless, it, is, a, free, flowing, coronal, wind, with, an, average, apparent, magnitude, of, 0, 08, capella, is, the, brightest, object, in, the, constellation, auriga, the, sixth, brightest, star, in, the, night, sky, the, third, brightest, in, the, northern, celestial, hemisphere, after, arcturus, and, vega, and, the, fourth, brightest, visible, to, the, naked, eye, from, the, latitude, 40, n, it, appears, to, be, a, rich, yellowish, white, colour, although, the, yellow, colour, is, more, apparent, during, daylight, observation, with, a, telescope, due, to, the, contrast, against, the, blue, sky, capella, is, closer, to, the, north, celestial, pole, than, any, other, first, magnitude, star, its, northern, declination, is, such, that, it, is, actually, invisible, south, of, latitude, 44, s, this, includes, southernmost, new, zealand, argentina, and, chile, as, well, as, the, falkland, islands, conversely, it, is, circumpolar, north, of, 44, n, for, the, whole, of, the, united, kingdom, and, canada, except, for, part, of, southern, ontario, most, of, europe, and, the, northernmost, fringes, of, the, contiguous, united, states, the, star, never, sets, capella, and, vega, are, on, opposite, sides, of, the, pole, at, about, the, same, distance, from, it, such, that, an, imaginary, line, between, the, two, stars, will, nearly, pass, through, polaris, visible, halfway, between, orion, s, belt, and, polaris, capella, is, at, its, highest, in, the, night, sky, at, midnight, in, early, december, and, is, regarded, as, a, prominent, star, of, the, northern, winter, sky, a, few, degrees, to, the, southwest, of, capella, lie, three, stars, epsilon, aurigae, zeta, aurigae, and, eta, aurigae, the, latter, two, of, which, are, known, as, the, kids, or, haedi, the, four, form, a, familiar, pattern, or, asterism, in, the, sky, based, on, an, annual, parallax, shift, of, 76, 20, milliarcseconds, with, a, margin, of, error, of, 0, 46, milliarcseconds, as, measured, by, the, hipparcos, satellite, this, system, is, estimated, to, be, 42, 8, light, years, 13, 12, parsecs, from, earth, with, a, margin, of, error, of, 0, 3, light, year, 0, 09, parsec, an, alternative, method, to, determine, the, distance, is, via, the, orbital, parallax, which, gives, a, distance, of, 42, 92, light, years, 13, 159, parsecs, with, a, margin, of, error, of, only, 0, 1, capella, is, estimated, to, have, been, a, little, closer, to, the, solar, system, in, the, past, passing, within, 29, light, years, distant, around, 237, 000, years, ago, at, this, range, it, would, have, shone, at, apparent, magnitude, 0, 82, comparable, to, canopus, today, in, a, 1960, paper, american, astronomer, olin, j, eggen, concluded, that, capella, was, a, member, of, the, hyades, moving, group, a, group, of, stars, moving, in, the, same, direction, as, the, hyades, cluster, after, analysing, its, proper, motion, and, parallax, members, of, the, group, are, of, a, similar, age, and, those, that, are, around, 2, 5, times, as, massive, as, the, sun, have, moved, off, the, main, sequence, after, exhausting, their, core, hydrogen, reserves, and, are, expanding, and, cooling, into, red, giants, there, are, several, stars, within, a, few, arcminutes, of, capella, and, some, have, been, listed, as, companions, in, various, multiple, star, catalogues, the, washington, double, star, catalog, lists, components, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, l, m, n, o, p, q, and, r, with, a, being, the, naked, eye, star, most, are, only, line, of, sight, companions, but, the, close, pair, of, red, dwarfs, h, and, l, are, at, the, same, distance, as, the, bright, component, a, and, moving, through, space, along, with, it, capella, a, is, itself, a, spectroscopic, binary, with, components, aa, and, ab, both, giant, stars, the, pair, of, giants, is, separated, from, the, pair, of, red, dwarfs, by, 723, american, astronomer, robert, burnham, jr, described, a, scale, model, of, the, system, where, capella, a, was, represented, by, spheres, 13, and, 7, inches, across, separated, by, ten, feet, the, red, dwarfs, were, then, each, 0, 7, inch, across, and, they, were, separated, by, 420, feet, at, this, scale, the, two, pairs, are, 21, miles, apart, capella, a, consists, of, two, yellow, evolved, stars, that, have, been, calculated, to, orbit, each, other, every, 104, 02128, 0, 00016, days, with, a, semimajor, axis, of, 111, 11, 0, 10, million, km, 0, 74272, 0, 00069, au, roughly, the, distance, between, venus, and, the, sun, the, pair, is, not, an, eclipsing, binary, that, is, as, seen, from, earth, neither, star, passes, in, front, of, the, other, the, orbit, is, known, extremely, accurately, and, can, be, used, to, derive, an, orbital, parallax, with, far, better, precision, than, the, one, measured, directly, the, stars, are, not, near, enough, to, each, other, for, the, roche, lobe, of, either, star, to, have, been, filled, and, any, significant, mass, transfer, to, have, taken, place, even, during, the, red, giant, stage, of, the, primary, star, modern, convention, designates, the, more, luminous, cooler, star, as, component, aa, and, its, spectral, type, has, been, usually, measured, between, g2, and, k0, the, hotter, secondary, ab, has, been, given, various, spectral, types, of, late, cooler, f, or, early, warmer, g, the, mk, spectral, types, of, the, two, stars, have, been, measured, a, number, of, times, and, they, are, both, consistently, assigned, a, luminosity, class, of, iii, indicating, a, giant, star, the, composite, spectrum, appears, to, be, dominated, by, the, primary, star, due, to, its, sharper, absorption, lines, the, lines, from, the, secondary, are, broadened, and, blurred, by, its, rapid, rotation, the, composite, spectral, class, is, given, as, approximately, g3iii, but, with, a, specific, mention, of, features, due, to, a, cooler, component, the, most, recent, specific, published, types, are, k0iii, and, g1iii, although, older, values, are, still, widely, quoted, such, as, g5iiie, g0iii, from, the, bright, star, catalogue, or, g8iii, g0iii, by, eggen, where, the, context, is, clear, these, two, components, have, been, referred, to, as, a, and, b, the, individual, apparent, magnitudes, of, the, two, component, stars, cannot, be, directly, measured, but, their, relative, brightness, has, been, measured, at, various, wavelengths, they, have, very, nearly, equal, brightness, in, the, visible, light, spectrum, with, the, hotter, secondary, component, generally, being, found, to, be, a, few, tenths, of, a, magnitude, brighter, a, 2016, measurement, gives, the, magnitude, difference, between, the, two, stars, at, a, wavelength, of, 700, nm, as, 0, 00, 0, 1, the, physical, properties, of, the, two, stars, can, be, determined, with, high, accuracy, the, masses, are, derived, directly, from, the, orbital, solution, with, aa, being, 2, 5687, 0, 0074, m, and, ab, being, 2, 4828, 0, 0067, m, their, angular, radii, have, been, directly, measured, in, combination, with, the, very, accurate, distance, this, gives, 11, 98, 0, 57, r, and, 8, 83, 0, 33, r, for, aa, and, ab, respectively, their, surface, temperatures, can, be, calculated, by, comparison, of, observed, and, synthetic, spectra, direct, measurement, of, their, angular, diameters, and, brightnesses, calibration, against, their, observed, colour, indices, and, disentangling, of, high, resolution, spectra, weighted, averages, of, these, four, methods, give, 4, 970, 50, k, for, aa, and, 5, 730, 60, for, ab, their, bolometric, luminosities, are, most, accurately, derived, from, their, apparent, magnitudes, and, bolometric, corrections, but, are, confirmed, by, calculation, from, the, temperatures, and, radii, of, the, stars, aa, is, 78, 7, 4, 2, times, as, luminous, as, the, sun, and, ab, 72, 7, 3, 6, times, as, luminous, so, the, star, defined, as, the, primary, component, is, the, more, luminous, when, all, wavelengths, are, considered, but, very, slightly, less, bright, at, visual, wavelengths, estimated, to, be, 590, to, 650, million, years, old, the, stars, were, probably, at, the, hot, end, of, spectral, class, a, during, their, main, sequence, lifetime, similar, to, vega, they, have, now, exhausted, their, core, hydrogen, and, evolved, off, the, main, sequence, their, outer, layers, expanding, and, cooling, despite, the, giant, luminosity, class, the, secondary, component, is, very, clearly, within, the, hertzsprung, gap, on, the, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, still, expanding, and, cooling, towards, the, red, giant, branch, making, it, a, subgiant, in, evolutionary, terms, the, more, massive, primary, has, already, passed, through, this, stage, when, it, reached, a, maximum, radius, of, 36, to, 38, times, that, of, the, sun, it, is, now, a, red, clump, star, which, is, fusing, helium, to, carbon, and, oxygen, in, its, core, a, process, that, has, not, yet, begun, for, the, less, massive, star, detailed, analysis, shows, that, it, is, nearing, the, end, of, this, stage, and, starting, to, expand, again, which, will, lead, it, to, the, asymptotic, giant, branch, isotope, abundances, and, spin, rates, confirm, this, evolutionary, difference, between, the, two, stars, heavy, element, abundances, are, broadly, comparable, to, those, of, the, sun, and, the, overall, metallicity, is, slightly, less, than, the, sun, s, the, rotational, period, of, each, star, can, be, measured, by, observing, periodic, variations, in, the, doppler, shifts, of, their, spectral, lines, the, absolute, rotational, velocities, of, the, two, stars, are, known, from, their, inclinations, rotation, periods, and, sizes, but, the, projected, equatorial, rotational, velocities, measured, using, doppler, broadening, of, spectral, lines, are, a, standard, measure, and, these, are, generally, quoted, capella, aa, has, a, projected, rotational, velocity, of, 4, 1, 0, 4, km, per, second, taking, 104, 3, days, to, complete, one, rotation, while, capella, ab, spins, much, more, rapidly, at, 35, 0, 0, 5, km, per, second, completing, a, full, rotation, in, only, 8, 5, 0, 2, days, rotational, braking, occurs, in, all, stars, when, they, expand, into, giants, and, binary, stars, are, also, tidally, braked, capella, aa, has, slowed, until, it, is, rotationally, locked, to, the, orbital, period, although, theory, predicts, that, it, should, still, be, rotating, more, quickly, from, a, starting, point, of, a, rapidly, spinning, main, sequence, a, star, capella, has, long, been, suspected, to, be, slightly, variable, its, amplitude, of, about, 0, 1, magnitudes, means, that, it, may, at, times, be, brighter, or, fainter, than, rigel, betelgeuse, and, vega, which, are, also, variable, the, system, has, been, classified, as, an, rs, canum, venaticorum, variable, a, class, of, binary, stars, with, active, chromospheres, that, cause, huge, starspots, but, it, is, still, only, listed, as, a, suspected, variable, in, the, general, catalogue, of, variable, stars, unusually, for, rs, cvn, systems, the, hotter, star, capella, ab, has, the, more, active, atmosphere, because, it, is, located, in, the, hertzsprung, gap, a, stage, where, it, is, changing, its, angular, momentum, and, deepening, its, convection, zone, the, active, atmospheres, and, closeness, of, these, stars, means, that, they, are, among, the, brightest, x, ray, sources, in, the, sky, however, the, x, ray, emission, is, due, to, stable, coronal, structures, and, not, eruptive, flaring, activity, coronal, loops, larger, than, the, sun, and, with, temperatures, of, several, million, kelvin, are, likely, to, be, responsible, for, the, majority, of, the, x, rays, the, seventh, companion, published, for, capella, component, h, is, physically, associated, with, the, bright, primary, star, it, is, a, red, dwarf, separated, from, the, pair, of, g, type, giants, by, a, distance, of, around, 10, 000, au, it, has, its, own, close, companion, an, even, fainter, red, dwarf, that, was, 1, 8, away, when, it, was, discovered, in, 1935, it, is, component, l, in, double, star, catalogues, in, 2015, the, separation, had, increased, to, 3, 5, which, was, sufficient, to, allow, tentative, orbital, parameters, to, be, derived, 80, years, after, its, discovery, the, gliese, jahreiss, catalogue, of, nearby, stars, designates, the, binary, system, as, gj, 195, the, two, components, are, then, referred, to, individually, as, gj, 195, a, and, b, the, two, stars, are, reported, to, have, a, 3, 5, visual, magnitude, difference, 2, 3, mag, in, the, passband, of, the, gaia, spacecraft, although, the, difference, is, much, smaller, at, infrared, wavelengths, this, is, unexpected, and, may, indicate, further, unseen, companions, the, mass, of, the, stars, can, in, principle, be, determined, from, the, orbital, motion, but, uncertainties, in, the, orbit, have, led, to, widely, varying, results, in, 1975, an, eccentric, 388, year, orbit, gave, masses, of, 0, 65, m, and, 0, 13, m, a, smaller, near, circular, orbit, published, in, 2015, had, a, 300, year, orbit, benefitting, from, mass, constraints, of, 0, 57, m, and, 0, 53, m, respectively, for, gj, 195, a, and, b, based, on, their, infrared, magnitudes, six, visual, companions, to, capella, were, discovered, before, capella, h, and, are, generally, known, only, as, capella, b, through, g, none, are, thought, to, be, physically, associated, with, capella, although, all, appear, closer, in, the, sky, than, the, hl, pair, component, f, is, also, known, as, tyc, 3358, 3142, 1, it, is, listed, with, a, spectral, type, of, k, although, it, is, included, in, a, catalogue, of, ob, stars, as, a, distant, luminous, star, component, g, is, bd, 45, 1076, with, a, spectral, type, of, f0, at, a, distance, of, 401, light, years, 123, parsecs, it, is, identified, as, a, variable, member, of, the, guide, star, catalogue, from, chandra, observations, although, it, is, not, known, what, type, of, variability, it, is, known, to, be, an, x, ray, source, with, an, active, corona, several, other, stars, have, also, been, catalogued, as, companions, to, capella, components, i, q, and, r, are, 13th, magnitude, stars, at, distances, of, 92, 133, and, 134, v538, aurigae, and, its, close, companion, hd, 233153, are, red, dwarfs, ten, degrees, away, from,
