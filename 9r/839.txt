in, atomic, physics, and, quantum, chemistry, the, electron, configuration, is, the, distribution, of, electrons, of, an, atom, or, molecule, or, other, physical, structure, in, atomic, or, molecular, orbitals, for, example, the, electron, configuration, of, the, neon, atom, is, 1s, 2, 2s, 2, 2p, 6, meaning, that, the, 1s, 2s, and, 2p, subshells, are, occupied, by, two, two, and, six, electrons, respectively, electronic, configurations, describe, each, electron, as, moving, independently, in, an, orbital, in, an, average, field, created, by, the, nuclei, and, all, the, other, electrons, mathematically, configurations, are, described, by, slater, determinants, or, configuration, state, functions, according, to, the, laws, of, quantum, mechanics, a, level, of, energy, is, associated, with, each, electron, configuration, in, certain, conditions, electrons, are, able, to, move, from, one, configuration, to, another, by, the, emission, or, absorption, of, a, quantum, of, energy, in, the, form, of, a, photon, knowledge, of, the, electron, configuration, of, different, atoms, is, useful, in, understanding, the, structure, of, the, periodic, table, of, elements, for, describing, the, chemical, bonds, that, hold, atoms, together, and, in, understanding, the, chemical, formulas, of, compounds, and, the, geometries, of, molecules, in, bulk, materials, this, same, idea, helps, explain, the, peculiar, properties, of, lasers, and, semiconductors, electron, configuration, was, first, conceived, under, the, bohr, model, of, the, atom, and, it, is, still, common, to, speak, of, shells, and, subshells, despite, the, advances, in, understanding, of, the, quantum, mechanical, nature, of, electrons, an, electron, shell, is, the, set, of, allowed, states, that, share, the, same, principal, quantum, number, n, that, electrons, may, occupy, in, each, term, of, an, electron, configuration, n, is, the, positive, integer, that, precedes, each, orbital, letter, helium, s, electron, configuration, is, 1s, 2, therefore, n, 1, and, the, orbital, contains, two, electrons, an, atom, s, n, th, electron, shell, can, accommodate, 2, n, 2, electrons, for, example, the, first, shell, can, accommodate, two, electrons, the, second, shell, eight, electrons, the, third, shell, eighteen, and, so, on, the, factor, of, two, arises, because, the, number, of, allowed, states, doubles, with, each, successive, shell, due, to, electron, spin, each, atomic, orbital, admits, up, to, two, otherwise, identical, electrons, with, opposite, spin, one, with, a, spin, 1, 2, usually, denoted, by, an, up, arrow, and, one, with, a, spin, of, 1, 2, with, a, down, arrow, a, subshell, is, the, set, of, states, defined, by, a, common, azimuthal, quantum, number, l, within, a, shell, the, value, of, l, is, in, the, range, from, 0, to, n, 1, the, values, l, 0, 1, 2, 3, correspond, to, the, s, p, d, and, f, labels, respectively, for, example, the, 3d, subshell, has, n, 3, and, l, 2, the, maximum, number, of, electrons, that, can, be, placed, in, a, subshell, is, given, by, 2, 2, l, 1, this, gives, two, electrons, in, an, s, subshell, six, electrons, in, a, p, subshell, ten, electrons, in, a, d, subshell, and, fourteen, electrons, in, an, f, subshell, the, numbers, of, electrons, that, can, occupy, each, shell, and, each, subshell, arise, from, the, equations, of, quantum, mechanics, in, particular, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, which, states, that, no, two, electrons, in, the, same, atom, can, have, the, same, values, of, the, four, quantum, numbers, physicists, and, chemists, use, a, standard, notation, to, indicate, the, electron, configurations, of, atoms, and, molecules, for, atoms, the, notation, consists, of, a, sequence, of, atomic, subshell, labels, e, g, for, phosphorus, the, sequence, 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, with, the, number, of, electrons, assigned, to, each, subshell, placed, as, a, superscript, for, example, hydrogen, has, one, electron, in, the, s, orbital, of, the, first, shell, so, its, configuration, is, written, 1s, 1, lithium, has, two, electrons, in, the, 1s, subshell, and, one, in, the, higher, energy, 2s, subshell, so, its, configuration, is, written, 1s, 2, 2s, 1, pronounced, one, s, two, two, s, one, phosphorus, atomic, number, 15, is, as, follows, 1s, 2, 2s, 2, 2p, 6, 3s, 2, 3p, 3, for, atoms, with, many, electrons, this, notation, can, become, lengthy, and, so, an, abbreviated, notation, is, used, the, electron, configuration, can, be, visualized, as, the, core, electrons, equivalent, to, the, noble, gas, of, the, preceding, period, and, the, valence, electrons, each, element, in, a, period, differs, only, by, the, last, few, subshells, phosphorus, for, instance, is, in, the, third, period, it, differs, from, the, second, period, neon, whose, configuration, is, 1s, 2, 2s, 2, 2p, 6, only, by, the, presence, of, a, third, shell, the, portion, of, its, configuration, that, is, equivalent, to, neon, is, abbreviated, as, allowing, the, configuration, of, phosphorus, to, be, written, as, 3s, 2, 3p, 3, rather, than, writing, out, the, details, of, the, configuration, of, neon, explicitly, this, convention, is, useful, as, it, is, the, electrons, in, the, outermost, shell, that, most, determine, the, chemistry, of, the, element, for, a, given, configuration, the, order, of, writing, the, orbitals, is, not, completely, fixed, since, only, the, orbital, occupancies, have, physical, significance, for, example, the, electron, configuration, of, the, titanium, ground, state, can, be, written, as, either, 4s, 2, 3d, 2, or, 3d, 2, 4s, 2, the, first, notation, follows, the, order, based, on, the, madelung, rule, for, the, configurations, of, neutral, atoms, 4s, is, filled, before, 3d, in, the, sequence, ar, k, ca, sc, ti, the, second, notation, groups, all, orbitals, with, the, same, value, of, n, together, corresponding, to, the, spectroscopic, order, of, orbital, energies, that, is, the, reverse, of, the, order, in, which, electrons, are, removed, from, a, given, atom, to, form, positive, ions, 3d, is, filled, before, 4s, in, the, sequence, ti, 4, ti, 3, ti, 2, ti, ti, the, superscript, 1, for, a, singly, occupied, subshell, is, not, compulsory, for, example, aluminium, may, be, written, as, either, 3s, 2, 3p, 1, or, 3s, 2, 3p, in, atoms, where, a, subshell, is, unoccupied, despite, higher, subshells, being, occupied, as, is, the, case, in, some, ions, as, well, as, certain, neutral, atoms, shown, to, deviate, from, the, madelung, rule, the, empty, subshell, is, either, denoted, with, a, superscript, 0, or, left, out, altogether, for, example, neutral, palladium, may, be, written, as, either, 4d, 10, 5s, 0, or, simply, 4d, 10, and, the, lanthanum, iii, ion, may, be, written, as, either, 4f, 0, or, simply, it, is, quite, common, to, see, the, letters, of, the, orbital, labels, s, p, d, f, written, in, an, italic, or, slanting, typeface, although, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, iupac, recommends, a, normal, typeface, as, used, here, the, choice, of, letters, originates, from, a, now, obsolete, system, of, categorizing, spectral, lines, as, s, harp, p, rincipal, d, iffuse, and, f, undamental, or, f, ine, based, on, their, observed, fine, structure, their, modern, usage, indicates, orbitals, with, an, azimuthal, quantum, number, l, of, 0, 1, 2, or, 3, respectively, after, f, the, sequence, continues, alphabetically, g, h, i, l, 4, 5, 6, skipping, j, although, orbitals, of, these, types, are, rarely, required, the, electron, configurations, of, molecules, are, written, in, a, similar, way, except, that, molecular, orbital, labels, are, used, instead, of, atomic, orbital, labels, see, below, the, energy, associated, to, an, electron, is, that, of, its, orbital, the, energy, of, a, configuration, is, often, approximated, as, the, sum, of, the, energy, of, each, electron, neglecting, the, electron, electron, interactions, the, configuration, that, corresponds, to, the, lowest, electronic, energy, is, called, the, ground, state, any, other, configuration, is, an, excited, state, as, an, example, the, ground, state, configuration, of, the, sodium, atom, is, 1s, 2, 2s, 2, 2p, 6, 3s, 1, as, deduced, from, the, aufbau, principle, see, below, the, first, excited, state, is, obtained, by, promoting, a, 3s, electron, to, the, 3p, subshell, to, obtain, the, 1s, 2, 2s, 2, 2p, 6, 3p, 1, configuration, abbreviated, as, the, 3p, level, atoms, can, move, from, one, configuration, to, another, by, absorbing, or, emitting, energy, in, a, sodium, vapor, lamp, for, example, sodium, atoms, are, excited, to, the, 3p, level, by, an, electrical, discharge, and, return, to, the, ground, state, by, emitting, yellow, light, of, wavelength, 589, nm, usually, the, excitation, of, valence, electrons, such, as, 3s, for, sodium, involves, energies, corresponding, to, photons, of, visible, or, ultraviolet, light, the, excitation, of, core, electrons, is, possible, but, requires, much, higher, energies, generally, corresponding, to, x, ray, photons, this, would, be, the, case, for, example, to, excite, a, 2p, electron, of, sodium, to, the, 3s, level, and, form, the, excited, 1s, 2, 2s, 2, 2p, 5, 3s, 2, configuration, the, remainder, of, this, article, deals, only, with, the, ground, state, configuration, often, referred, to, as, the, configuration, of, an, atom, or, molecule, irving, langmuir, was, the, first, to, propose, in, his, 1919, article, the, arrangement, of, electrons, in, atoms, and, molecules, in, which, building, on, gilbert, n, lewis, s, cubical, atom, theory, and, walther, kossel, s, chemical, bonding, theory, he, outlined, his, concentric, theory, of, atomic, structure, langmuir, had, developed, his, work, on, electron, atomic, structure, from, other, chemists, as, is, shown, in, the, development, of, the, history, of, the, periodic, table, and, the, octet, rule, niels, bohr, 1923, incorporated, langmuir, s, model, that, the, periodicity, in, the, properties, of, the, elements, might, be, explained, by, the, electronic, structure, of, the, atom, his, proposals, were, based, on, the, then, current, bohr, model, of, the, atom, in, which, the, electron, shells, were, orbits, at, a, fixed, distance, from, the, nucleus, bohr, s, original, configurations, would, seem, strange, to, a, present, day, chemist, sulfur, was, given, as, 2, 4, 4, 6, instead, of, 1s, 2, 2s, 2, 2p, 6, 3s, 2, 3p, 4, 2, 8, 6, bohr, used, 4, and, 6, following, alfred, werner, s, 1893, paper, in, fact, the, chemists, accepted, the, concept, of, atoms, long, before, the, physicists, langmuir, began, his, paper, referenced, above, by, saying, the, problem, of, the, structure, of, atoms, has, been, attacked, mainly, by, physicists, who, have, given, little, consideration, to, the, chemical, properties, which, must, ultimately, be, explained, by, a, theory, of, atomic, structure, the, vast, store, of, knowledge, of, chemical, properties, and, relationships, such, as, is, summarized, by, the, periodic, table, should, serve, as, a, better, foundation, for, a, theory, of, atomic, structure, than, the, relatively, meager, experimental, data, along, purely, physical, lines, these, electrons, arrange, themselves, in, a, series, of, concentric, shells, the, first, shell, containing, two, electrons, while, all, other, shells, tend, to, hold, eight, the, valence, electrons, in, the, atom, were, described, by, richard, abegg, in, 1904, in, 1924, e, c, stoner, incorporated, sommerfeld, s, third, quantum, number, into, the, description, of, electron, shells, and, correctly, predicted, the, shell, structure, of, sulfur, to, be, 2, 8, 6, however, neither, bohr, s, system, nor, stoner, s, could, correctly, describe, the, changes, in, atomic, spectra, in, a, magnetic, field, the, zeeman, effect, bohr, was, well, aware, of, this, shortcoming, and, others, and, had, written, to, his, friend, wolfgang, pauli, in, 1923, to, ask, for, his, help, in, saving, quantum, theory, the, system, now, known, as, old, quantum, theory, pauli, hypothesized, successfully, that, the, zeeman, effect, can, be, explained, as, depending, only, on, the, response, of, the, outermost, i, e, valence, electrons, of, the, atom, pauli, was, able, to, reproduce, stoner, s, shell, structure, but, with, the, correct, structure, of, subshells, by, his, inclusion, of, a, fourth, quantum, number, and, his, exclusion, principle, 1925, it, should, be, forbidden, for, more, than, one, electron, with, the, same, value, of, the, main, quantum, number, n, to, have, the, same, value, for, the, other, three, quantum, numbers, k, j, and, m, the, schr, dinger, equation, published, in, 1926, gave, three, of, the, four, quantum, numbers, as, a, direct, consequence, of, its, solution, for, the, hydrogen, atom, this, solution, yields, the, atomic, orbitals, that, are, shown, today, in, textbooks, of, chemistry, and, above, the, examination, of, atomic, spectra, allowed, the, electron, configurations, of, atoms, to, be, determined, experimentally, and, led, to, an, empirical, rule, known, as, madelung, s, rule, 1936, see, below, for, the, order, in, which, atomic, orbitals, are, filled, with, electrons, the, aufbau, principle, from, the, german, aufbau, building, up, construction, was, an, important, part, of, bohr, s, original, concept, of, electron, configuration, it, may, be, stated, as, the, principle, works, very, well, for, the, ground, states, of, the, atoms, for, the, known, 118, elements, although, it, is, sometimes, slightly, wrong, the, modern, form, of, the, aufbau, principle, describes, an, order, of, orbital, energies, given, by, madelung, s, rule, or, klechkowski, s, rule, this, rule, was, first, stated, by, charles, janet, in, 1929, rediscovered, by, erwin, madelung, in, 1936, and, later, given, a, theoretical, justification, by, v, m, klechkowski, this, gives, the, following, order, for, filling, the, orbitals, in, this, list, the, subshells, in, parentheses, are, not, occupied, in, the, ground, state, of, the, heaviest, atom, now, known, og, z, 118, the, aufbau, principle, can, be, applied, in, a, modified, form, to, the, protons, and, neutrons, in, the, atomic, nucleus, as, in, the, shell, model, of, nuclear, physics, and, nuclear, chemistry, the, form, of, the, periodic, table, is, closely, related, to, the, atomic, electron, configuration, for, each, element, for, example, all, the, elements, of, group, 2, the, table, s, second, column, have, an, electron, configuration, of, n, s, 2, where, is, a, noble, gas, configuration, and, have, notable, similarities, in, their, chemical, properties, the, periodicity, of, the, periodic, table, in, terms, of, periodic, table, blocks, is, due, to, the, number, of, electrons, 2, 6, 10, and, 14, needed, to, fill, s, p, d, and, f, subshells, these, blocks, appear, as, the, rectangular, sections, of, the, periodic, table, the, single, exception, is, helium, which, despite, being, an, s, block, atom, is, conventionally, placed, with, the, other, noble, gasses, in, the, p, block, due, to, its, chemical, inertness, a, consequence, of, its, full, outer, shell, though, there, is, discussion, in, the, contemporary, literature, on, whether, this, exception, should, be, retained, the, electrons, in, the, valence, outermost, shell, largely, determine, each, element, s, chemical, properties, the, similarities, in, the, chemical, properties, were, remarked, on, more, than, a, century, before, the, idea, of, electron, configuration, the, aufbau, principle, rests, on, a, fundamental, postulate, that, the, order, of, orbital, energies, is, fixed, both, for, a, given, element, and, between, different, elements, in, both, cases, this, is, only, approximately, true, it, considers, atomic, orbitals, as, boxes, of, fixed, energy, into, which, can, be, placed, two, electrons, and, no, more, however, the, energy, of, an, electron, in, an, atomic, orbital, depends, on, the, energies, of, all, the, other, electrons, of, the, atom, or, ion, or, molecule, etc, there, are, no, one, electron, solutions, for, systems, of, more, than, one, electron, only, a, set, of, many, electron, solutions, that, cannot, be, calculated, exactly, although, there, are, mathematical, approximations, available, such, as, the, hartree, fock, method, the, fact, that, the, aufbau, principle, is, based, on, an, approximation, can, be, seen, from, the, fact, that, there, is, an, almost, fixed, filling, order, at, all, that, within, a, given, shell, the, s, orbital, is, always, filled, before, the, p, orbitals, in, a, hydrogen, like, atom, which, only, has, one, electron, the, s, orbital, and, the, p, orbitals, of, the, same, shell, have, exactly, the, same, energy, to, a, very, good, approximation, in, the, absence, of, external, electromagnetic, fields, however, in, a, real, hydrogen, atom, the, energy, levels, are, slightly, split, by, the, magnetic, field, of, the, nucleus, and, by, the, quantum, electrodynamic, effects, of, the, lamb, shift, the, na, ve, application, of, the, aufbau, principle, leads, to, a, well, known, paradox, or, apparent, paradox, in, the, basic, chemistry, of, the, transition, metals, potassium, and, calcium, appear, in, the, periodic, table, before, the, transition, metals, and, have, electron, configurations, 4s, 1, and, 4s, 2, respectively, i, e, the, 4s, orbital, is, filled, before, the, 3d, orbital, this, is, in, line, with, madelung, s, rule, as, the, 4s, orbital, has, n, l, 4, n, 4, l, 0, while, the, 3d, orbital, has, n, l, 5, n, 3, l, 2, after, calcium, most, neutral, atoms, in, the, first, series, of, transition, metals, scandium, through, zinc, have, configurations, with, two, 4s, electrons, but, there, are, two, exceptions, chromium, and, copper, have, electron, configurations, 3d, 5, 4s, 1, and, 3d, 10, 4s, 1, respectively, i, e, one, electron, has, passed, from, the, 4s, orbital, to, a, 3d, orbital, to, generate, a, half, filled, or, filled, subshell, in, this, case, the, usual, explanation, is, that, half, filled, or, completely, filled, subshells, are, particularly, stable, arrangements, of, electrons, however, this, is, not, supported, by, the, facts, as, tungsten, w, has, a, madelung, following, d, 4, s, 2, configuration, and, not, d, 5, s, 1, and, niobium, nb, has, an, anomalous, d, 4, s, 1, configuration, that, does, not, give, it, a, half, filled, or, completely, filled, subshell, the, apparent, paradox, arises, when, electrons, are, removed, from, the, transition, metal, atoms, to, form, ions, the, first, electrons, to, be, ionized, come, not, from, the, 3d, orbital, as, one, would, expect, if, it, were, higher, in, energy, but, from, the, 4s, orbital, this, interchange, of, electrons, between, 4s, and, 3d, is, found, for, all, atoms, of, the, first, series, of, transition, metals, the, configurations, of, the, neutral, atoms, k, ca, sc, ti, v, cr, usually, follow, the, order, 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, however, the, successive, stages, of, ionization, of, a, given, atom, such, as, fe, 4, fe, 3, fe, 2, fe, fe, usually, follow, the, order, 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, this, phenomenon, is, only, paradoxical, if, it, is, assumed, that, the, energy, order, of, atomic, orbitals, is, fixed, and, unaffected, by, the, nuclear, charge, or, by, the, presence, of, electrons, in, other, orbitals, if, that, were, the, case, the, 3d, orbital, would, have, the, same, energy, as, the, 3p, orbital, as, it, does, in, hydrogen, yet, it, clearly, does, not, there, is, no, special, reason, why, the, fe, 2, ion, should, have, the, same, electron, configuration, as, the, chromium, atom, given, that, iron, has, two, more, protons, in, its, nucleus, than, chromium, and, that, the, chemistry, of, the, two, species, is, very, different, melrose, and, eric, scerri, have, analyzed, the, changes, of, orbital, energy, with, orbital, occupations, in, terms, of, the, two, electron, repulsion, integrals, of, the, hartree, fock, method, of, atomic, structure, calculation, more, recently, scerri, has, argued, that, contrary, to, what, is, stated, in, the, vast, majority, of, sources, including, the, title, of, his, previous, article, on, the, subject, 3d, orbitals, rather, than, 4s, are, in, fact, preferentially, occupied, in, chemical, environments, configurations, can, change, even, more, th, 3, as, a, bare, ion, has, a, configuration, of, 5f, 1, yet, in, most, th, iii, compounds, the, thorium, atom, has, a, 6d, 1, configuration, instead, mostly, what, is, present, is, rather, a, superposition, of, various, configurations, for, instance, copper, metal, is, poorly, described, by, either, an, 3d, 10, 4s, 1, or, an, 3d, 9, 4s, 2, configuration, but, is, rather, well, described, as, a, 90, contribution, of, the, first, and, a, 10, contribution, of, the, second, indeed, visible, light, is, already, enough, to, excite, electrons, in, most, transition, metals, and, they, often, continuously, flow, through, different, configurations, when, that, happens, copper, and, its, group, are, an, exception, similar, ion, like, 3d, x, 4s, 0, configurations, occur, in, transition, metal, complexes, as, described, by, the, simple, crystal, field, theory, even, if, the, metal, has, oxidation, state, 0, for, example, chromium, hexacarbonyl, can, be, described, as, a, chromium, atom, not, ion, surrounded, by, six, carbon, monoxide, ligands, the, electron, configuration, of, the, central, chromium, atom, is, described, as, 3d, 6, with, the, six, electrons, filling, the, three, lower, energy, d, orbitals, between, the, ligands, the, other, two, d, orbitals, are, at, higher, energy, due, to, the, crystal, field, of, the, ligands, this, picture, is, consistent, with, the, experimental, fact, that, the, complex, is, diamagnetic, meaning, that, it, has, no, unpaired, electrons, however, in, a, more, accurate, description, using, molecular, orbital, theory, the, d, like, orbitals, occupied, by, the, six, electrons, are, no, longer, identical, with, the, d, orbitals, of, the, free, atom, there, are, several, more, exceptions, to, madelung, s, rule, among, the, heavier, elements, and, as, atomic, number, increases, it, becomes, more, and, more, difficult, to, find, simple, explanations, such, as, the, stability, of, half, filled, subshells, it, is, possible, to, predict, most, of, the, exceptions, by, hartree, fock, calculations, which, are, an, approximate, method, for, taking, account, of, the, effect, of, the, other, electrons, on, orbital, energies, qualitatively, for, example, the, 4d, elements, have, the, greatest, concentration, of, madelung, anomalies, because, the, 4d, 5s, gap, is, larger, than, the, 3d, 4s, and, 5d, 6s, gaps, for, the, heavier, elements, it, is, also, necessary, to, take, account, of, the, effects, of, special, relativity, on, the, energies, of, the, atomic, orbitals, as, the, inner, shell, electrons, are, moving, at, speeds, approaching, the, speed, of, light, in, general, these, relativistic, effects, tend, to, decrease, the, energy, of, the, s, orbitals, in, relation, to, the, other, atomic, orbitals, this, is, the, reason, why, the, 6d, elements, are, predicted, to, have, no, madelung, anomalies, apart, from, lawrencium, for, which, relativistic, effects, stabilise, the, p, 1, 2, orbital, as, well, and, cause, its, occupancy, in, the, ground, state, as, relativity, intervenes, to, make, the, 7s, orbitals, lower, in, energy, than, the, 6d, ones, the, table, below, shows, the, configurations, of, the, f, block, green, and, d, block, blue, atoms, it, shows, the, ground, state, configuration, in, terms, of, orbital, occupancy, but, it, does, not, show, the, ground, state, in, terms, of, the, sequence, of, orbital, energies, as, determined, spectroscopically, for, example, in, the, transition, metals, the, 4s, orbital, is, of, a, higher, energy, than, the, 3d, orbitals, and, in, the, lanthanides, the, 6s, is, higher, than, the, 4f, and, 5d, the, ground, states, can, be, seen, in, the, electron, configurations, of, the, elements, data, page, however, this, also, depends, on, the, charge, a, calcium, atom, has, 4s, lower, in, energy, than, 3d, but, a, ca, 2, cation, has, 3d, lower, in, energy, than, 4s, in, practice, the, configurations, predicted, by, the, madelung, rule, are, at, least, close, to, the, ground, state, even, in, these, anomalous, cases, the, empty, f, orbitals, in, lanthanum, actinium, and, thorium, contribute, to, chemical, bonding, as, do, the, empty, p, orbitals, in, transition, metals, vacant, s, d, and, f, orbitals, have, been, shown, explicitly, as, is, occasionally, done, to, emphasise, the, filling, order, and, to, clarify, that, even, orbitals, unoccupied, in, the, ground, state, e, g, lanthanum, 4f, or, palladium, 5s, may, be, occupied, and, bonding, in, chemical, compounds, the, same, is, also, true, for, the, p, orbitals, which, are, not, explicitly, shown, because, they, are, only, actually, occupied, for, lawrencium, in, gas, phase, ground, states, the, various, anomalies, describe, the, free, atoms, and, do, not, necessarily, predict, chemical, behavior, thus, for, example, neodymium, typically, forms, the, 3, oxidation, state, despite, its, configuration, 4f, 4, 5d, 0, 6s, 2, that, if, interpreted, na, vely, would, suggest, a, more, stable, 2, oxidation, state, corresponding, to, losing, only, the, 6s, electrons, contrariwise, uranium, as, 5f, 3, 6d, 1, 7s, 2, is, not, very, stable, in, the, 3, oxidation, state, either, preferring, 4, and, 6, the, electron, shell, configuration, of, elements, beyond, hassium, has, not, yet, been, empirically, verified, but, they, are, expected, to, follow, madelung, s, rule, without, exceptions, until, element, 120, element, 121, should, have, the, anomalous, configuration, 8s, 2, 5g, 0, 6f, 0, 7d, 0, 8p, 1, having, a, p, rather, than, a, g, electron, electron, configurations, beyond, this, are, tentative, and, predictions, differ, between, models, but, madelung, s, rule, is, expected, to, break, down, due, to, the, closeness, in, energy, of, the, 5g, 6f, 7d, and, 8p, 1, 2, orbitals, that, said, the, filling, sequence, 8s, 5g, 6f, 7d, 8p, is, predicted, to, hold, approximately, with, perturbations, due, to, the, huge, spin, orbit, splitting, of, the, 8p, and, 9p, shells, and, the, huge, relativistic, stabilisation, of, the, 9s, shell, in, the, context, of, atomic, orbitals, an, open, shell, is, a, valence, shell, which, is, not, completely, filled, with, electrons, or, that, has, not, given, all, of, its, valence, electrons, through, chemical, bonds, with, other, atoms, or, molecules, during, a, chemical, reaction, conversely, a, closed, shell, is, obtained, with, a, completely, filled, valence, shell, this, configuration, is, very, stable, for, molecules, open, shell, signifies, that, there, are, unpaired, electrons, in, molecular, orbital, theory, this, leads, to, molecular, orbitals, that, are, singly, occupied, in, computational, chemistry, implementations, of, molecular, orbital, theory, open, shell, molecules, have, to, be, handled, by, either, the, restricted, open, shell, hartree, fock, method, or, the, unrestricted, hartree, fock, method, conversely, a, closed, shell, configuration, corresponds, to, a, state, where, all, molecular, orbitals, are, either, doubly, occupied, or, empty, a, singlet, state, open, shell, molecules, are, more, difficult, to, study, computationally, noble, gas, configuration, is, the, electron, configuration, of, noble, gases, the, basis, of, all, chemical, reactions, is, the, tendency, of, chemical, elements, to, acquire, stability, main, group, atoms, generally, obey, the, octet, rule, while, transition, metals, generally, obey, the, 18, electron, rule, the, noble, gases, he, ne, ar, kr, xe, rn, are, less, reactive, than, other, elements, because, they, already, have, a, noble, gas, configuration, oganesson, is, predicted, to, be, more, reactive, due, to, relativistic, effects, for, heavy, atoms, every, system, has, the, tendency, to, acquire, the, state, of, stability, or, a, state, of, minimum, energy, and, so, chemical, elements, take, part, in, chemical, reactions, to, acquire, a, stable, electronic, configuration, similar, to, that, of, its, nearest, noble, gas, an, example, of, this, tendency, is, two, hydrogen, h, atoms, reacting, with, one, oxygen, o, atom, to, form, water, h, 2, o, neutral, atomic, hydrogen, has, one, electron, in, its, valence, shell, and, on, formation, of, water, it, acquires, a, share, of, a, second, electron, coming, from, oxygen, so, that, its, configuration, is, similar, to, that, of, its, nearest, noble, gas, helium, he, with, two, electrons, in, its, valence, shell, similarly, neutral, atomic, oxygen, has, six, electrons, in, its, valence, shell, and, acquires, a, share, of, two, electrons, from, the, two, hydrogen, atoms, so, that, its, configuration, is, similar, to, that, of, its, nearest, noble, gas, neon, with, eight, electrons, in, its, valence, shell, electron, configuration, in, molecules, is, more, complex, than, the, electron, configuration, of, atoms, as, each, molecule, has, a, different, orbital, structure, the, molecular, orbitals, are, labelled, according, to, their, symmetry, rather, than, the, atomic, orbital, labels, used, for, atoms, and, monatomic, ions, hence, the, electron, configuration, of, the, dioxygen, molecule, o, 2, is, written, 1, g, 2, 1, u, 2, 2, g, 2, 2, u, 2, 3, g, 2, 1, u, 4, 1, g, 2, or, equivalently, 1, g, 2, 1, u, 2, 2, g, 2, 2, u, 2, 1, u, 4, 3, g, 2, 1, g, 2, the, term, 1, g, 2, represents, the, two, electrons, in, the, two, degenerate, orbitals, antibonding, from, hund, s, rules, these, electrons, have, parallel, spins, in, the, ground, state, and, so, dioxygen, has, a, net, magnetic, moment, it, is, paramagnetic, the, explanation, of, the, paramagnetism, of, dioxygen, was, a, major, success, for, molecular, orbital, theory, the, electronic, configuration, of, polyatomic, molecules, can, change, without, absorption, or, emission, of, a, photon, through, vibronic, couplings, in, a, solid, the, electron, states, become, very, numerous, they, cease, to, be, discrete, and, effectively, blend, into, continuous, ranges, of, possible, states, an, electron, band, the, notion, of, electron, configuration, ceases, to, be, relevant, and, yields, to, band, theory, the, most, widespread, application, of, electron, configurations, is, in, the, rationalization, of, chemical, properties, in, both, inorganic, and, organic, chemistry, in, effect, electron, configurations, along, with, some, simplified, forms, of, molecular, orbital, theory, have, become, the, modern, equivalent, of, the, valence, concept, describing, the, number, and, type, of, chemical, bonds, that, an, atom, can, be, expected, to, form, this, approach, is, taken, further, in, computational, chemistry, which, typically, attempts, to, make, quantitative, estimates, of, chemical, properties, for, many, years, most, such, calculations, relied, upon, the, linear, combination, of, atomic, orbitals, lcao, approximation, using, an, ever, larger, and, more, complex, basis, set, of, atomic, orbitals, as, the, starting, point, the, last, step, in, such, a, calculation, is, the, assignment, of, electrons, among, the, molecular, orbitals, according, to, the, aufbau, principle, not, all, methods, in, computational, chemistry, rely, on, electron, configuration, density, functional, theory, dft, is, an, important, example, of, a, method, that, discards, the, model, for, atoms, or, molecules, with, more, than, one, electron, the, motion, of, electrons, are, correlated, and, such, a, picture, is, no, longer, exact, a, very, large, number, of, electronic, configurations, are, needed, to, exactly, describe, any, multi, electron, system, and, no, energy, can, be, associated, with, one, single, configuration, however, the, electronic, wave, function, is, usually, dominated, by, a, very, small, number, of, configurations, and, therefore, the, notion, of, electronic, configuration, remains, essential, for, multi, electron, systems, a, fundamental, application, of, electron, configurations, is, in, the, interpretation, of, atomic, spectra, in, this, case, it, is, necessary, to, supplement, the, electron, configuration, with, one, or, more, term, symbols, which, describe, the, different, energy, levels, available, to, an, atom, term, symbols, can, be, calculated, for, any, electron, configuration, not, just, the, ground, state, configuration, listed, in, tables, although, not, all, the, energy, levels, are, observed, in, practice, it, is, through, the, analysis, of, atomic, spectra, that, the, ground, state, electron, configurations, of, the, elements, were, experimentally, determined
