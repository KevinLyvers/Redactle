pangaea, or, pangea, p, n, d, i, was, a, supercontinent, that, existed, during, the, late, paleozoic, and, early, mesozoic, eras, it, assembled, from, the, earlier, continental, units, of, gondwana, euramerica, and, siberia, during, the, carboniferous, approximately, 335, million, years, ago, and, began, to, break, apart, about, 200, million, years, ago, at, the, end, of, the, triassic, and, beginning, of, the, jurassic, pangaea, was, c, shaped, with, the, bulk, of, its, mass, stretching, between, earth, s, northern, and, southern, polar, regions, and, surrounded, by, the, superocean, panthalassa, and, the, paleo, tethys, and, subsequent, tethys, oceans, pangaea, is, the, most, recent, supercontinent, to, have, existed, and, the, first, to, be, reconstructed, by, geologists, the, name, pangaea, is, derived, from, ancient, greek, pan, all, entire, whole, and, gaia, or, gaea, mother, earth, land, the, first, to, suggest, that, the, continents, were, once, joined, and, later, separated, may, have, been, abraham, ortelius, in, 1596, the, concept, that, the, continents, once, formed, a, contiguous, land, mass, was, hypothesised, with, corroborating, evidence, by, alfred, wegener, the, originator, of, the, scientific, theory, of, continental, drift, in, three, 1912, academic, journal, articles, written, in, german, titled, die, entstehung, der, kontinente, the, origin, of, continents, he, expanded, upon, his, hypothesis, in, his, 1915, book, of, the, same, title, in, which, he, postulated, that, before, breaking, up, and, drifting, to, their, present, locations, all, the, continents, had, formed, a, single, supercontinent, that, he, called, the, urkontinent, wegener, used, the, name, pangaea, once, in, the, 1920, edition, of, his, book, referring, to, the, ancient, supercontinent, as, the, pangaea, of, the, carboniferous, he, used, the, germanized, form, pang, a, but, the, name, entered, german, and, english, scientific, literature, in, 1922, and, 1926, respectively, in, the, latinized, form, pangaea, especially, during, a, symposium, of, the, american, association, of, petroleum, geologists, in, november, 1926, wegener, originally, proposed, that, the, breakup, of, pangaea, was, caused, by, centripetal, forces, from, earth, s, rotation, acting, on, the, high, continents, however, this, mechanism, was, easily, shown, to, be, physically, implausible, which, delayed, acceptance, of, the, pangaea, hypothesis, arthur, holmes, proposed, the, more, plausible, mechanism, of, mantle, convection, which, together, with, evidence, provided, by, the, mapping, of, the, ocean, floor, following, the, second, world, war, led, to, the, development, and, acceptance, of, the, theory, of, plate, tectonics, this, theory, provides, the, widely, accepted, explanation, for, the, existence, and, breakup, of, pangaea, the, geography, of, the, continents, bordering, the, atlantic, ocean, was, the, first, evidence, suggesting, the, existence, of, pangaea, the, seemingly, close, fit, of, the, coastlines, of, north, and, south, america, with, europe, and, africa, was, remarked, on, almost, as, soon, as, these, coasts, were, charted, careful, reconstructions, showed, that, the, mismatch, at, the, 500, fathoms, 3, 000, feet, 910, meters, contour, was, less, than, 130, km, 81, mi, and, it, was, argued, that, this, was, much, too, similar, to, be, attributed, to, coincidence, additional, evidence, for, pangaea, is, found, in, the, geology, of, adjacent, continents, including, matching, geological, trends, between, the, eastern, coast, of, south, america, and, the, western, coast, of, africa, the, polar, ice, cap, of, the, carboniferous, covered, the, southern, end, of, pangaea, glacial, deposits, specifically, till, of, the, same, age, and, structure, are, found, on, many, separate, continents, that, would, have, been, together, in, the, continent, of, pangaea, the, continuity, of, mountain, chains, provides, further, evidence, such, as, the, appalachian, mountains, chain, extending, from, the, southeastern, united, states, to, the, scandinavian, caledonides, of, europe, these, are, now, believed, to, have, formed, a, single, chain, the, central, pangean, mountains, fossil, evidence, for, pangaea, includes, the, presence, of, similar, and, identical, species, on, continents, that, are, now, great, distances, apart, for, example, fossils, of, the, therapsid, lystrosaurus, have, been, found, in, south, africa, india, and, antarctica, alongside, members, of, the, glossopteris, flora, whose, distribution, would, have, ranged, from, the, polar, circle, to, the, equator, if, the, continents, had, been, in, their, present, position, similarly, the, freshwater, reptile, mesosaurus, has, been, found, in, only, localized, regions, of, the, coasts, of, brazil, and, west, africa, geologists, can, also, determine, the, movement, of, continental, plates, by, examining, the, orientation, of, magnetic, minerals, in, rocks, when, rocks, are, formed, they, take, on, the, magnetic, orientation, of, the, earth, showing, which, direction, the, poles, lie, relative, to, the, rock, this, determines, latitudes, and, orientations, though, not, longitudes, magnetic, differences, between, samples, of, sedimentary, and, intrusive, igneous, rock, whose, age, varies, by, millions, of, years, is, due, to, a, combination, of, magnetic, polar, wander, with, a, cycle, of, a, few, thousand, years, and, the, drifting, of, continents, over, millions, of, years, the, polar, wander, component, which, is, identical, for, all, contemporaneous, samples, can, be, subtracted, leaving, the, portion, that, shows, continental, drift, and, can, be, used, to, help, reconstruct, earlier, continental, latitudes, and, orientations, pangaea, is, the, most, recent, supercontinent, reconstructed, from, the, geologic, record, and, therefore, is, by, far, the, best, understood, the, formation, of, supercontinents, and, their, breakup, appears, to, be, cyclical, through, earth, s, history, there, may, have, been, several, others, before, pangaea, paleomagnetic, measurements, help, geologists, determine, the, latitude, and, orientation, of, ancient, continental, blocks, and, newer, techniques, may, help, determine, longitudes, paleontology, helps, determine, ancient, climates, confirming, latitude, estimates, from, paleomagnetic, measurements, and, the, distribution, of, ancient, forms, of, life, provides, clues, on, which, continental, blocks, were, close, to, each, other, at, particular, geological, moments, however, reconstructions, of, continents, prior, to, pangaea, including, the, ones, in, this, section, remain, partially, speculative, and, different, reconstructions, will, differ, in, some, details, the, fourth, last, supercontinent, called, columbia, or, nuna, appears, to, have, assembled, in, the, period, 2, 0, 1, 8, billion, years, ago, ga, columbia, nuna, broke, up, and, the, next, supercontinent, rodinia, formed, from, the, accretion, and, assembly, of, its, fragments, rodinia, lasted, from, about, 1, 3, billion, years, ago, until, about, 750, million, years, ago, but, its, configuration, and, geodynamic, history, are, not, nearly, as, well, understood, as, those, of, the, later, supercontinents, pannotia, and, pangaea, according, to, one, reconstruction, when, rodinia, broke, up, it, split, into, three, pieces, proto, laurasia, proto, gondwana, and, the, smaller, congo, craton, proto, laurasia, and, proto, gondwana, were, separated, by, the, proto, tethys, ocean, proto, laurasia, split, apart, to, form, the, continents, of, laurentia, siberia, and, baltica, baltica, moved, to, the, east, of, laurentia, and, siberia, moved, northeast, of, laurentia, the, split, created, two, oceans, the, iapetus, ocean, and, paleoasian, ocean, most, of, these, landmasses, coalesced, again, to, form, the, relatively, short, lived, supercontinent, pannotia, which, included, large, areas, of, land, near, the, poles, and, a, small, strip, connecting, the, polar, masses, near, the, equator, pannotia, lasted, until, 540, ma, near, the, beginning, of, the, cambrian, and, then, broke, up, giving, rise, to, the, continents, of, laurentia, baltica, and, the, southern, supercontinent, gondwana, in, the, cambrian, laurentia, which, would, later, become, north, america, sat, on, the, equator, with, three, bordering, oceans, the, panthalassic, ocean, to, the, north, and, west, the, iapetus, ocean, to, the, south, and, the, khanty, ocean, to, the, east, in, the, early, ordovician, around, 480, ma, the, microcontinent, avalonia, a, landmass, incorporating, fragments, of, what, would, become, eastern, newfoundland, the, southern, british, isles, and, parts, of, belgium, northern, france, nova, scotia, new, england, south, iberia, and, northwest, africa, broke, free, from, gondwana, and, began, its, journey, to, laurentia, baltica, laurentia, and, avalonia, all, came, together, by, the, end, of, the, ordovician, to, form, a, landmass, called, euramerica, or, laurussia, closing, the, iapetus, ocean, the, collision, resulted, in, the, formation, of, the, northern, appalachians, siberia, sat, near, euramerica, with, the, khanty, ocean, between, the, two, continents, while, all, this, was, happening, gondwana, drifted, slowly, towards, the, south, pole, this, was, the, first, step, of, the, formation, of, pangaea, the, second, step, in, the, formation, of, pangaea, was, the, collision, of, gondwana, with, euramerica, by, the, middle, of, the, silurian, 430, ma, baltica, had, already, collided, with, laurentia, forming, euramerica, an, event, called, the, caledonian, orogeny, as, avalonia, inched, towards, laurentia, the, seaway, between, them, a, remnant, of, the, iapetus, ocean, was, slowly, shrinking, meanwhile, southern, europe, broke, off, from, gondwana, and, began, to, move, towards, euramerica, across, the, rheic, ocean, it, collided, with, southern, baltica, in, the, devonian, by, the, late, silurian, annamia, indochina, and, the, south, china, craton, split, from, gondwana, and, moved, northward, shrinking, the, proto, tethys, ocean, and, opening, the, paleo, tethys, ocean, to, the, south, in, the, devonian, gondwana, moved, towards, euramerica, causing, the, rheic, ocean, to, shrink, in, the, early, carboniferous, northwest, africa, had, touched, the, southeastern, coast, of, euramerica, creating, the, southern, portion, of, the, appalachian, mountains, the, meseta, mountains, and, the, mauritanide, mountains, an, event, called, the, variscan, orogeny, south, america, moved, northward, to, southern, euramerica, while, the, eastern, portion, of, gondwana, india, antarctica, and, australia, headed, toward, the, south, pole, from, the, equator, north, and, south, china, were, on, independent, continents, the, kazakhstania, microcontinent, had, collided, with, siberia, siberia, had, been, a, separate, continent, for, millions, of, years, since, the, breakup, of, pannotia, the, variscan, orogeny, raised, the, central, pangaean, mountains, which, were, comparable, to, the, modern, himalayas, in, scale, with, pangaea, stretching, from, the, south, pole, across, the, equator, and, well, into, the, northern, hemisphere, an, intense, megamonsoon, climate, was, established, except, for, a, perpetually, wet, zone, immediately, around, the, central, mountains, western, kazakhstania, collided, with, baltica, in, the, late, carboniferous, closing, the, ural, ocean, and, the, western, proto, tethys, uralian, orogeny, causing, the, formation, of, the, ural, mountains, and, laurasia, this, was, the, last, step, of, the, formation, of, pangaea, meanwhile, south, america, had, collided, with, southern, laurentia, closing, the, rheic, ocean, and, completing, the, variscian, orogeny, with, the, formation, the, southernmost, part, of, the, appalachians, and, ouachita, mountains, by, this, time, gondwana, was, positioned, near, the, south, pole, and, glaciers, formed, in, antarctica, india, australia, southern, africa, and, south, america, the, north, china, craton, collided, with, siberia, by, the, jurassic, completely, closing, the, proto, tethys, ocean, by, the, early, permian, the, cimmerian, plate, split, from, gondwana, and, moved, towards, laurasia, thus, closing, the, paleo, tethys, ocean, and, forming, the, tethys, ocean, in, its, southern, end, most, of, the, landmasses, were, all, in, one, by, the, triassic, pangaea, rotated, a, little, and, the, cimmerian, plate, was, still, travelling, across, the, shrinking, paleo, tethys, until, the, middle, jurassic, by, the, late, triassic, the, paleo, tethys, had, closed, from, west, to, east, creating, the, cimmerian, orogeny, pangaea, which, looked, like, a, c, with, the, tethys, ocean, inside, the, c, had, rifted, by, the, middle, jurassic, pangaea, existed, as, a, supercontinent, for, 160, million, years, from, its, assembly, around, 335, ma, early, carboniferous, to, its, breakup, 175, ma, middle, jurassic, during, this, interval, important, developments, in, the, evolution, of, life, took, place, the, seas, of, the, early, carboniferous, were, dominated, by, rugose, corals, brachiopods, bryozoans, sharks, and, the, first, bony, fish, life, on, land, was, dominated, by, lycopsid, forests, inhabited, by, insects, and, other, arthropods, and, the, first, tetrapods, by, the, time, pangaea, broke, up, in, the, middle, jurassic, the, seas, swarmed, with, molluscs, particularly, ammonites, ichthyosaurs, sharks, and, rays, and, the, first, ray, finned, bony, fishes, while, life, on, land, was, dominated, by, forests, of, cycads, and, conifers, in, which, dinosaurs, flourished, and, in, which, the, first, true, mammals, had, appeared, the, evolution, of, life, in, this, time, reflected, the, conditions, created, by, the, assembly, of, pangaea, the, union, of, most, of, the, continental, crust, into, one, landmass, reduced, the, extent, of, sea, coasts, increased, erosion, from, uplifted, continental, crust, increased, the, importance, of, floodplain, and, delta, environments, relative, to, shallow, marine, environments, continental, assembly, and, uplift, also, meant, increasingly, arid, land, climates, favoring, the, evolution, of, amniote, animals, and, seed, plants, whose, eggs, and, seeds, were, better, adapted, to, dry, climates, the, early, drying, trend, was, most, pronounced, in, western, pangaea, which, became, a, center, of, the, evolution, and, geographical, spread, of, amniotes, coal, swamps, typically, form, in, perpetually, wet, regions, close, to, the, equator, the, assembly, of, pangaea, disrupted, the, intertropical, convergence, zone, and, created, an, extreme, monsoon, climate, that, reduced, the, deposition, of, coal, to, its, lowest, level, in, the, last, 300, million, years, during, the, permian, coal, deposition, was, largely, restricted, to, the, north, and, south, china, microcontinents, which, were, among, the, few, areas, of, continental, crust, that, had, not, joined, with, pangaea, the, extremes, of, climate, in, the, interior, of, pangaea, are, reflected, in, bone, growth, patterns, of, pareiasaurs, and, the, growth, patterns, in, gymnosperm, forests, the, lack, of, oceanic, barriers, is, thought, to, have, favored, cosmopolitanism, in, which, successful, species, attain, wide, geographical, distribution, cosmopolitanism, was, also, driven, by, mass, extinctions, including, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, the, most, severe, in, the, fossil, record, and, also, the, triassic, jurassic, extinction, event, these, events, resulted, in, disaster, fauna, showing, little, diversity, and, high, cosmopolitanism, including, lystrosaurus, which, opportunistically, spread, to, every, corner, of, pangaea, following, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, on, the, other, hand, there, is, evidence, that, many, pangaean, species, were, provincial, with, a, limited, geographical, range, despite, the, absence, of, geographical, barriers, this, may, be, due, to, the, strong, variations, in, climate, by, latitude, and, season, produced, by, the, extreme, monsoon, climate, for, example, cold, adapted, pteridosperms, early, seed, plants, of, gondwana, were, blocked, from, spreading, throughout, pangaea, by, the, equatorial, climate, and, northern, pteridosperms, ended, up, dominating, gondwana, in, the, triassic, the, tectonics, and, geography, of, pangaea, may, have, worsened, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, or, other, mass, extinctions, for, example, the, reduced, area, of, continental, shelf, environments, may, have, left, marine, species, vulnerable, to, extinction, however, no, evidence, for, a, species, area, effect, has, been, found, in, more, recent, and, better, characterized, portions, of, the, geologic, record, another, possibility, is, that, reduced, seafloor, spreading, associated, with, the, formation, of, pangaea, and, the, resulting, cooling, and, subsidence, of, oceanic, crust, may, have, reduced, the, number, of, islands, that, could, have, served, as, refugia, for, marine, species, species, diversity, may, have, already, been, reduced, prior, to, mass, extinction, events, due, to, mingling, of, species, possible, when, formerly, separate, continents, were, merged, however, there, is, strong, evidence, that, climate, barriers, continued, to, separate, ecological, communities, in, different, parts, of, pangaea, the, eruptions, of, the, emeishan, traps, may, have, eliminated, south, china, one, of, the, few, continental, areas, not, merged, with, pangaea, as, a, refugium, there, were, three, major, phases, in, the, break, up, of, pangaea, the, atlantic, ocean, did, not, open, uniformly, rifting, began, in, the, north, central, atlantic, the, first, breakup, of, pangaea, is, proposed, for, the, late, ladinian, 230, ma, with, initial, spreading, in, the, opening, central, atlantic, then, the, rifting, proceeded, along, the, eastern, margin, of, north, america, the, northwest, african, margin, and, the, high, saharan, and, tunisian, atlas, mountains, another, phase, began, in, the, early, middle, jurassic, about, 175, ma, when, pangaea, began, to, rift, from, the, tethys, ocean, in, the, east, to, the, pacific, ocean, in, the, west, the, rifting, that, took, place, between, north, america, and, africa, produced, multiple, failed, rifts, one, rift, resulted, in, the, north, atlantic, ocean, the, south, atlantic, did, not, open, until, the, cretaceous, when, laurasia, started, to, rotate, clockwise, and, moved, northward, with, north, america, to, the, north, and, eurasia, to, the, south, the, clockwise, motion, of, laurasia, led, much, later, to, the, closing, of, the, tethys, ocean, and, the, widening, of, the, sinus, borealis, which, later, became, the, arctic, ocean, meanwhile, on, the, other, side, of, africa, and, along, the, adjacent, margins, of, east, africa, antarctica, and, madagascar, rifts, formed, that, led, to, the, formation, of, the, southwestern, indian, ocean, in, the, cretaceous, the, second, major, phase, in, the, break, up, of, pangaea, began, in, the, early, cretaceous, 150, 140, ma, when, gondwana, separated, into, multiple, continents, africa, south, america, india, antarctica, and, australia, the, subduction, at, tethyan, trench, probably, caused, africa, india, and, australia, to, move, northward, causing, the, opening, of, a, south, indian, ocean, in, the, early, cretaceous, atlantica, today, s, south, america, and, africa, separated, from, eastern, gondwana, then, in, the, middle, cretaceous, gondwana, fragmented, to, open, up, the, south, atlantic, ocean, as, south, america, started, to, move, westward, away, from, africa, the, south, atlantic, did, not, develop, uniformly, rather, it, rifted, from, south, to, north, also, at, the, same, time, madagascar, and, insular, india, began, to, separate, from, antarctica, and, moved, northward, opening, up, the, indian, ocean, madagascar, and, india, separated, from, each, other, 100, 90, ma, in, the, late, cretaceous, india, continued, to, move, northward, toward, eurasia, at, 15, centimeters, 6, in, per, year, a, plate, tectonic, record, closing, the, eastern, tethys, ocean, while, madagascar, stopped, and, became, locked, to, the, african, plate, new, zealand, new, caledonia, and, the, rest, of, zealandia, began, to, separate, from, australia, moving, eastward, toward, the, pacific, and, opening, the, coral, sea, and, tasman, sea, the, third, major, and, final, phase, of, the, break, up, of, pangaea, occurred, in, the, early, cenozoic, paleocene, to, oligocene, laurasia, split, when, laurentia, broke, from, eurasia, opening, the, norwegian, sea, about, 60, 55, ma, the, atlantic, and, indian, oceans, continued, to, expand, closing, the, tethys, ocean, meanwhile, australia, split, from, antarctica, and, moved, quickly, northward, just, as, india, had, done, more, than, 40, million, years, before, australia, is, currently, on, a, collision, course, with, eastern, asia, both, australia, and, india, are, currently, moving, northeast, at, 5, 6, centimeters, 2, 3, in, per, year, antarctica, has, been, near, or, at, the, south, pole, since, the, formation, of, pangaea, about, 280, ma, india, started, to, collide, with, asia, beginning, about, 35, ma, forming, the, himalayan, orogeny, and, closing, the, tethys, ocean, this, collision, continues, today, the, african, plate, started, to, change, directions, from, west, to, northwest, toward, europe, and, south, america, began, to, move, in, a, northward, direction, separating, it, from, antarctica, and, allowing, complete, oceanic, circulation, around, antarctica, for, the, first, time, this, motion, together, with, decreasing, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, concentrations, caused, a, rapid, cooling, of, antarctica, and, allowed, glaciers, to, form, this, glaciation, eventually, coalesced, into, the, kilometers, thick, ice, sheets, seen, today, other, major, events, took, place, during, the, cenozoic, including, the, opening, of, the, gulf, of, california, the, uplift, of, the, alps, and, the, opening, of, the, sea, of, japan, the, break, up, of, pangaea, continues, today, in, the, red, sea, rift, and, east, african, rift, the, breakup, of, pangaea, was, accompanied, by, outgassing, of, large, quantities, of, carbon, dioxide, from, continental, rifts, this, produced, a, mesozoic, co, 2, high, that, contributed, to, the, very, warm, climate, of, the, early, cretaceous, the, opening, of, the, tethys, ocean, also, contributed, to, the, warming, of, the, climate, the, very, active, mid, ocean, ridges, associated, with, the, breakup, of, pangaea, raised, sea, levels, to, the, highest, in, the, geological, record, flooding, much, of, the, continents, the, expansion, of, the, temperate, climate, zones, that, accompanied, the, breakup, of, pangaea, may, have, contributed, to, the, diversification, of, the, angiosperms, africa, antarctica, asia, australia, europe, north, america, south, america, afro, eurasia, americas, eurasia, oceania
