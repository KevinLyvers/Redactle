in, chemistry, a, salt, or, ionic, compound, is, a, chemical, compound, consisting, of, an, assembly, of, positively, charged, ions, cations, and, negatively, charged, ions, anions, which, results, in, a, compound, with, no, net, electric, charge, electrically, neutral, the, constituent, ions, are, held, together, by, electrostatic, forces, termed, ionic, bonds, the, component, ions, in, a, salt, can, be, either, inorganic, such, as, chloride, cl, or, organic, such, as, acetate, ch, 3, coo, each, ion, can, be, either, monatomic, termed, simple, ion, such, as, fluoride, f, and, sodium, na, and, chloride, cl, in, sodium, chloride, or, polyatomic, such, as, sulfate, so, 2, 4, and, ammonium, nh, 4, and, carbonate, co, 2, 3, ions, in, ammonium, carbonate, salt, containing, basic, ions, hydroxide, oh, or, oxide, o, 2, are, classified, as, bases, for, example, sodium, hydroxide, individual, ions, within, a, salt, usually, have, multiple, near, neighbours, so, they, are, not, considered, to, be, part, of, molecules, but, instead, part, of, a, continuous, three, dimensional, network, salts, usually, form, crystalline, structures, when, solid, salts, composed, of, small, ions, typically, have, high, melting, and, boiling, points, and, are, hard, and, brittle, as, solids, they, are, almost, always, electrically, insulating, but, when, melted, or, dissolved, they, become, highly, conductive, because, the, ions, become, mobile, some, salts, have, large, cations, large, anions, or, both, in, terms, of, their, properties, such, species, often, are, more, similar, to, organic, compounds, in, 1913, the, structure, of, sodium, chloride, was, determined, by, william, henry, bragg, and, william, lawrence, bragg, this, revealed, that, there, were, six, equidistant, nearest, neighbours, for, each, atom, demonstrating, that, the, constituents, were, not, arranged, in, molecules, or, finite, aggregates, but, instead, as, a, network, with, long, range, crystalline, order, many, other, inorganic, compounds, were, also, found, to, have, similar, structural, features, these, compounds, were, soon, described, as, being, constituted, of, ions, rather, than, neutral, atoms, but, proof, of, this, hypothesis, was, not, found, until, the, mid, 1920s, when, x, ray, reflection, experiments, which, detect, the, density, of, electrons, were, performed, principal, contributors, to, the, development, of, a, theoretical, treatment, of, ionic, crystal, structures, were, max, born, fritz, haber, alfred, land, erwin, madelung, paul, peter, ewald, and, kazimierz, fajans, born, predicted, crystal, energies, based, on, the, assumption, of, ionic, constituents, which, showed, good, correspondence, to, thermochemical, measurements, further, supporting, the, assumption, many, metals, such, as, the, alkali, metals, react, directly, with, the, electronegative, halogens, gases, to, salts, salts, form, upon, evaporation, of, their, solutions, once, the, solution, is, supersaturated, and, the, solid, compound, nucleates, this, process, occurs, widely, in, nature, and, is, the, means, of, formation, of, the, evaporite, minerals, insoluble, salts, can, be, precipitated, by, mixing, two, solutions, one, with, the, cation, and, one, with, the, anion, in, it, because, all, solutions, are, electrically, neutral, the, two, solutions, mixed, must, also, contain, counterions, of, the, opposite, charges, to, ensure, that, these, do, not, contaminate, the, precipitated, salt, it, is, important, to, ensure, they, do, not, also, precipitate, if, the, two, solutions, have, hydrogen, ions, and, hydroxide, ions, as, the, counterions, they, will, react, with, one, another, in, what, is, called, an, acid, base, reaction, or, a, neutralization, reaction, to, form, water, alternately, the, counterions, can, be, chosen, to, ensure, that, even, when, combined, into, a, single, solution, they, will, remain, soluble, as, spectator, ions, if, the, solvent, is, water, in, either, the, evaporation, or, precipitation, method, of, formation, in, many, cases, the, ionic, crystal, formed, also, includes, water, of, crystallization, so, the, product, is, known, as, a, hydrate, and, can, have, very, different, chemical, properties, compared, to, the, anhydrous, material, molten, salts, will, solidify, on, cooling, to, below, their, freezing, point, this, is, sometimes, used, for, the, solid, state, synthesis, of, complex, salts, from, solid, reactants, which, are, first, melted, together, in, other, cases, the, solid, reactants, do, not, need, to, be, melted, but, instead, can, react, through, a, solid, state, reaction, route, in, this, method, the, reactants, are, repeatedly, finely, ground, into, a, paste, and, then, heated, to, a, temperature, where, the, ions, in, neighboring, reactants, can, diffuse, together, during, the, time, the, reactant, mixture, remains, in, the, oven, other, synthetic, routes, use, a, solid, precursor, with, the, correct, stoichiometric, ratio, of, non, volatile, ions, which, is, heated, to, drive, off, other, species, in, some, reactions, between, highly, reactive, metals, usually, from, group, 1, or, group, 2, and, highly, electronegative, halogen, gases, or, water, the, atoms, can, be, ionized, by, electron, transfer, a, process, thermodynamically, understood, using, the, born, haber, cycle, salts, are, formed, by, salt, forming, reactions, ions, in, salts, are, primarily, held, together, by, the, electrostatic, forces, between, the, charge, distribution, of, these, bodies, and, in, particular, the, ionic, bond, resulting, from, the, long, ranged, coulomb, attraction, between, the, net, negative, charge, of, the, anions, and, net, positive, charge, of, the, cations, there, is, also, a, small, additional, attractive, force, from, van, der, waals, interactions, which, contributes, only, around, 1, 2, of, the, cohesive, energy, for, small, ions, when, a, pair, of, ions, comes, close, enough, for, their, outer, electron, shells, most, simple, ions, have, closed, shells, to, overlap, a, short, ranged, repulsive, force, occurs, due, to, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, the, balance, between, these, forces, leads, to, a, potential, energy, well, with, minimum, energy, when, the, nuclei, are, separated, by, a, specific, equilibrium, distance, if, the, electronic, structure, of, the, two, interacting, bodies, is, affected, by, the, presence, of, one, another, covalent, interactions, non, ionic, also, contribute, to, the, overall, energy, of, the, compound, formed, salts, are, rarely, purely, ionic, i, e, held, together, only, by, electrostatic, forces, the, bonds, between, even, the, most, electronegative, electropositive, pairs, such, as, those, in, caesium, fluoride, exhibit, a, small, degree, of, covalency, conversely, covalent, bonds, between, unlike, atoms, often, exhibit, some, charge, separation, and, can, be, considered, to, have, a, partial, ionic, character, the, circumstances, under, which, a, compound, will, have, ionic, or, covalent, character, can, typically, be, understood, using, fajans, rules, which, use, only, charges, and, the, sizes, of, each, ion, according, to, these, rules, compounds, with, the, most, ionic, character, will, have, large, positive, ions, with, a, low, charge, bonded, to, a, small, negative, ion, with, a, high, charge, more, generally, hsab, theory, can, be, applied, whereby, the, compounds, with, the, most, ionic, character, are, those, consisting, of, hard, acids, and, hard, bases, small, highly, charged, ions, with, a, high, difference, in, electronegativities, between, the, anion, and, cation, this, difference, in, electronegativities, means, that, the, charge, separation, and, resulting, dipole, moment, is, maintained, even, when, the, ions, are, in, contact, the, excess, electrons, on, the, anions, are, not, transferred, or, polarized, to, neutralize, the, cations, although, chemists, classify, idealized, bond, types, as, being, ionic, or, covalent, the, existence, of, additional, types, such, as, hydrogen, bonds, and, metallic, bonds, for, example, has, led, some, philosophers, of, science, to, suggest, that, alternative, approaches, to, understanding, bonding, are, required, this, could, be, by, applying, quantum, mechanics, to, calculate, binding, energies, the, lattice, energy, is, the, summation, of, the, interaction, of, all, sites, with, all, other, sites, for, unpolarizable, spherical, ions, only, the, charges, and, distances, are, required, to, determine, the, electrostatic, interaction, energy, for, any, particular, ideal, crystal, structure, all, distances, are, geometrically, related, to, the, smallest, internuclear, distance, so, for, each, possible, crystal, structure, the, total, electrostatic, energy, can, be, related, to, the, electrostatic, energy, of, unit, charges, at, the, nearest, neighboring, distance, by, a, multiplicative, constant, called, the, madelung, constant, that, can, be, efficiently, computed, using, an, ewald, sum, when, a, reasonable, form, is, assumed, for, the, additional, repulsive, energy, the, total, lattice, energy, can, be, modelled, using, the, born, land, equation, the, born, mayer, equation, or, in, the, absence, of, structural, information, the, kapustinskii, equation, using, an, even, simpler, approximation, of, the, ions, as, impenetrable, hard, spheres, the, arrangement, of, anions, in, these, systems, are, often, related, to, close, packed, arrangements, of, spheres, with, the, cations, occupying, tetrahedral, or, octahedral, interstices, depending, on, the, stoichiometry, of, the, salt, and, the, coordination, principally, determined, by, the, radius, ratio, of, cations, and, anions, a, variety, of, structures, are, commonly, observed, and, theoretically, rationalized, by, pauling, s, rules, in, some, cases, the, anions, take, on, a, simple, cubic, packing, and, the, resulting, common, structures, observed, are, some, ionic, liquids, particularly, with, mixtures, of, anions, or, cations, can, be, cooled, rapidly, enough, that, there, is, not, enough, time, for, crystal, nucleation, to, occur, so, an, ionic, glass, is, formed, with, no, long, range, order, within, any, crystal, there, will, usually, be, some, defects, to, maintain, electroneutrality, of, the, crystals, defects, that, involve, loss, of, a, cation, will, be, associated, with, loss, of, an, anion, i, e, these, defects, come, in, pairs, frenkel, defects, consist, of, a, cation, vacancy, paired, with, a, cation, interstitial, and, can, be, generated, anywhere, in, the, bulk, of, the, crystal, occurring, most, commonly, in, compounds, with, a, low, coordination, number, and, cations, that, are, much, smaller, than, the, anions, schottky, defects, consist, of, one, vacancy, of, each, type, and, are, generated, at, the, surfaces, of, a, crystal, occurring, most, commonly, in, compounds, with, a, high, coordination, number, and, when, the, anions, and, cations, are, of, similar, size, if, the, cations, have, multiple, possible, oxidation, states, then, it, is, possible, for, cation, vacancies, to, compensate, for, electron, deficiencies, on, cation, sites, with, higher, oxidation, numbers, resulting, in, a, non, stoichiometric, compound, another, non, stoichiometric, possibility, is, the, formation, of, an, f, center, a, free, electron, occupying, an, anion, vacancy, when, the, compound, has, three, or, more, ionic, components, even, more, defect, types, are, possible, all, of, these, point, defects, can, be, generated, via, thermal, vibrations, and, have, an, equilibrium, concentration, because, they, are, energetically, costly, but, entropically, beneficial, they, occur, in, greater, concentration, at, higher, temperatures, once, generated, these, pairs, of, defects, can, diffuse, mostly, independently, of, one, another, by, hopping, between, lattice, sites, this, defect, mobility, is, the, source, of, most, transport, phenomena, within, an, ionic, crystal, including, diffusion, and, solid, state, ionic, conductivity, when, vacancies, collide, with, interstitials, frenkel, they, can, recombine, and, annihilate, one, another, similarly, vacancies, are, removed, when, they, reach, the, surface, of, the, crystal, schottky, defects, in, the, crystal, structure, generally, expand, the, lattice, parameters, reducing, the, overall, density, of, the, crystal, defects, also, result, in, ions, in, distinctly, different, local, environments, which, causes, them, to, experience, a, different, crystal, field, symmetry, especially, in, the, case, of, different, cations, exchanging, lattice, sites, this, results, in, a, different, splitting, of, d, electron, orbitals, so, that, the, optical, absorption, and, hence, colour, can, change, with, defect, concentration, ionic, compounds, containing, hydrogen, ions, h, are, classified, as, acids, and, those, containing, electropositive, cations, and, basic, anions, ions, hydroxide, oh, or, oxide, o, 2, are, classified, as, bases, other, ionic, compounds, are, known, as, salts, and, can, be, formed, by, acid, base, reactions, salts, that, produce, hydroxide, ions, when, dissolved, in, water, are, called, alkali, salts, and, salts, that, produce, hydrogen, ions, when, dissolved, in, water, are, called, acid, salts, if, the, compound, is, the, result, of, a, reaction, between, a, strong, acid, and, a, weak, base, the, result, is, an, acid, salt, if, it, is, the, result, of, a, reaction, between, a, strong, base, and, a, weak, acid, the, result, is, a, base, salt, if, it, is, the, result, of, a, reaction, between, a, strong, acid, and, a, strong, base, the, result, is, a, neutral, salt, weak, acids, reacted, with, weak, bases, can, produce, ionic, compounds, with, both, the, conjugate, base, ion, and, conjugate, acid, ion, such, as, ammonium, acetate, some, ions, are, classed, as, amphoteric, being, able, to, react, with, either, an, acid, or, a, base, this, is, also, true, of, some, compounds, with, ionic, character, typically, oxides, or, hydroxides, of, less, electropositive, metals, so, the, compound, also, has, significant, covalent, character, such, as, zinc, oxide, aluminium, hydroxide, aluminium, oxide, and, lead, ii, oxide, electrostatic, forces, between, particles, are, strongest, when, the, charges, are, high, and, the, distance, between, the, nuclei, of, the, ions, is, small, in, such, cases, the, compounds, generally, have, very, high, melting, and, boiling, points, and, a, low, vapour, pressure, trends, in, melting, points, can, be, even, better, explained, when, the, structure, and, ionic, size, ratio, is, taken, into, account, above, their, melting, point, salts, melt, and, become, molten, salts, although, some, salts, such, as, aluminium, chloride, and, iron, iii, chloride, show, molecule, like, structures, in, the, liquid, phase, inorganic, compounds, with, simple, ions, typically, have, small, ions, and, thus, have, high, melting, points, so, are, solids, at, room, temperature, some, substances, with, larger, ions, however, have, a, melting, point, below, or, near, room, temperature, often, defined, as, up, to, 100, c, and, are, termed, ionic, liquids, ions, in, ionic, liquids, often, have, uneven, charge, distributions, or, bulky, substituents, like, hydrocarbon, chains, which, also, play, a, role, in, determining, the, strength, of, the, interactions, and, propensity, to, melt, even, when, the, local, structure, and, bonding, of, an, ionic, solid, is, disrupted, sufficiently, to, melt, it, there, are, still, strong, long, range, electrostatic, forces, of, attraction, holding, the, liquid, together, and, preventing, ions, boiling, to, form, a, gas, phase, this, means, that, even, room, temperature, ionic, liquids, have, low, vapour, pressures, and, require, substantially, higher, temperatures, to, boil, boiling, points, exhibit, similar, trends, to, melting, points, in, terms, of, the, size, of, ions, and, strength, of, other, interactions, when, vapourized, the, ions, are, still, not, freed, of, one, another, for, example, in, the, vapour, phase, sodium, chloride, exists, as, diatomic, molecules, most, salts, are, very, brittle, once, they, reach, the, limit, of, their, strength, they, cannot, deform, malleably, because, the, strict, alignment, of, positive, and, negative, ions, must, be, maintained, instead, the, material, undergoes, fracture, via, cleavage, as, the, temperature, is, elevated, usually, close, to, the, melting, point, a, ductile, brittle, transition, occurs, and, plastic, flow, becomes, possible, by, the, motion, of, dislocations, the, compressibility, of, an, salt, is, strongly, determined, by, its, structure, and, in, particular, the, coordination, number, for, example, halides, with, the, caesium, chloride, structure, coordination, number, 8, are, less, compressible, than, those, with, the, sodium, chloride, structure, coordination, number, 6, and, less, again, than, those, with, a, coordination, number, of, 4, when, simple, salts, dissolve, they, dissociate, into, individual, ions, which, are, solvated, and, dispersed, throughout, the, resulting, solution, salts, do, not, exist, in, solution, in, contrast, molecular, compounds, which, includes, most, organic, compounds, remain, intact, in, solution, the, solubility, of, salts, is, highest, in, polar, solvents, such, as, water, or, ionic, liquids, but, tends, to, be, low, in, nonpolar, solvents, such, as, petrol, gasoline, this, contrast, is, principally, because, the, resulting, ion, dipole, interactions, are, significantly, stronger, than, ion, induced, dipole, interactions, so, the, heat, of, solution, is, higher, when, the, oppositely, charged, ions, in, the, solid, ionic, lattice, are, surrounded, by, the, opposite, pole, of, a, polar, molecule, the, solid, ions, are, pulled, out, of, the, lattice, and, into, the, liquid, if, the, solvation, energy, exceeds, the, lattice, energy, the, negative, net, enthalpy, change, of, solution, provides, a, thermodynamic, drive, to, remove, ions, from, their, positions, in, the, crystal, and, dissolve, in, the, liquid, in, addition, the, entropy, change, of, solution, is, usually, positive, for, most, solid, solutes, like, salts, which, means, that, their, solubility, increases, when, the, temperature, increases, there, are, some, unusual, salts, such, as, cerium, iii, sulfate, where, this, entropy, change, is, negative, due, to, extra, order, induced, in, the, water, upon, solution, and, the, solubility, decreases, with, temperature, the, lattice, energy, the, cohesive, forces, between, these, ions, within, a, solid, determines, the, solubility, the, solubility, is, dependent, on, how, well, each, ion, interacts, with, the, solvent, so, certain, patterns, become, apparent, for, example, salts, of, sodium, potassium, and, ammonium, are, usually, soluble, in, water, notable, exceptions, include, ammonium, hexachloroplatinate, and, potassium, cobaltinitrite, most, nitrates, and, many, sulfates, are, water, soluble, exceptions, include, barium, sulfate, calcium, sulfate, sparingly, soluble, and, lead, ii, sulfate, where, the, 2, 2, pairing, leads, to, high, lattice, energies, for, similar, reasons, most, metal, carbonates, are, not, soluble, in, water, some, soluble, carbonate, salts, are, sodium, carbonate, potassium, carbonate, and, ammonium, carbonate, salts, are, characteristically, insulators, although, they, contain, charged, atoms, or, clusters, these, materials, do, not, typically, conduct, electricity, to, any, significant, extent, when, the, substance, is, solid, in, order, to, conduct, the, charged, particles, must, be, mobile, rather, than, stationary, in, a, crystal, lattice, this, is, achieved, to, some, degree, at, high, temperatures, when, the, defect, concentration, increases, the, ionic, mobility, and, solid, state, ionic, conductivity, is, observed, when, the, salts, are, dissolved, in, a, liquid, or, are, melted, into, a, liquid, they, can, conduct, electricity, because, the, ions, become, completely, mobile, for, this, reason, molten, salts, and, solutions, containing, dissolved, salts, e, g, sodium, chloride, in, water, can, be, used, as, electrolytes, this, conductivity, gain, upon, dissolving, or, melting, is, sometimes, used, as, a, defining, characteristic, of, salts, in, some, unusual, salts, fast, ion, conductors, and, ionic, glasses, one, or, more, of, the, ionic, components, has, a, significant, mobility, allowing, conductivity, even, while, the, material, as, a, whole, remains, solid, this, is, often, highly, temperature, dependent, and, may, be, the, result, of, either, a, phase, change, or, a, high, defect, concentration, these, materials, are, used, in, all, solid, state, supercapacitors, batteries, and, fuel, cells, and, in, various, kinds, of, chemical, sensors, the, colour, of, a, salt, is, often, different, from, the, colour, of, an, aqueous, solution, containing, the, constituent, ions, or, the, hydrated, form, of, the, same, compound, the, anions, in, compounds, with, bonds, with, the, most, ionic, character, tend, to, be, colorless, with, an, absorption, band, in, the, ultraviolet, part, of, the, spectrum, in, compounds, with, less, ionic, character, their, color, deepens, through, yellow, orange, red, and, black, as, the, absorption, band, shifts, to, longer, wavelengths, into, the, visible, spectrum, the, absorption, band, of, simple, cations, shifts, toward, a, shorter, wavelength, when, they, are, involved, in, more, covalent, interactions, this, occurs, during, hydration, of, metal, ions, so, colorless, anhydrous, salts, with, an, anion, absorbing, in, the, infrared, can, become, colorful, in, solution, salts, exist, in, many, different, colors, which, arise, either, from, their, constituent, anions, cations, or, solvates, for, example, some, minerals, are, salts, some, of, which, are, soluble, in, water, similarly, inorganic, pigments, tend, not, to, be, salts, because, insolubility, is, required, for, fastness, some, organic, dyes, are, salts, but, they, are, virtually, insoluble, in, water, salts, can, elicit, all, five, basic, tastes, e, g, salty, sodium, chloride, sweet, lead, diacetate, which, will, cause, lead, poisoning, if, ingested, sour, potassium, bitartrate, bitter, magnesium, sulfate, and, umami, or, savory, monosodium, glutamate, salts, of, strong, acids, and, strong, bases, strong, salts, are, non, volatile, and, often, odorless, whereas, salts, of, either, weak, acids, or, weak, bases, weak, salts, may, smell, like, the, conjugate, acid, e, g, acetates, like, acetic, acid, vinegar, and, cyanides, like, hydrogen, cyanide, almonds, or, the, conjugate, base, e, g, ammonium, salts, like, ammonia, of, the, component, ions, that, slow, partial, decomposition, is, usually, accelerated, by, the, presence, of, water, since, hydrolysis, is, the, other, half, of, the, reversible, reaction, equation, of, formation, of, weak, salts, salts, have, long, had, a, wide, variety, of, uses, and, applications, many, minerals, are, ionic, humans, have, processed, common, salt, sodium, chloride, for, over, 8000, years, using, it, first, as, a, food, seasoning, and, preservative, and, now, also, in, manufacturing, agriculture, water, conditioning, for, de, icing, roads, and, many, other, uses, many, salts, are, so, widely, used, in, society, that, they, go, by, common, names, unrelated, to, their, chemical, identity, examples, of, this, include, borax, calomel, milk, of, magnesia, muriatic, acid, oil, of, vitriol, saltpeter, and, slaked, lime, soluble, salts, can, easily, be, dissolved, to, provide, electrolyte, solutions, this, is, a, simple, way, to, control, the, concentration, and, ionic, strength, the, concentration, of, solutes, affects, many, colligative, properties, including, increasing, the, osmotic, pressure, and, causing, freezing, point, depression, and, boiling, point, elevation, because, the, solutes, are, charged, ions, they, also, increase, the, electrical, conductivity, of, the, solution, the, increased, ionic, strength, reduces, the, thickness, of, the, electrical, double, layer, around, colloidal, particles, and, therefore, the, stability, of, emulsions, and, suspensions, the, chemical, identity, of, the, ions, added, is, also, important, in, many, uses, for, example, fluoride, containing, compounds, are, dissolved, to, supply, fluoride, ions, for, water, fluoridation, solid, salts, have, long, been, used, as, paint, pigments, and, are, resistant, to, organic, solvents, but, are, sensitive, to, acidity, or, basicity, since, 1801, pyrotechnicians, have, described, and, widely, used, metal, containing, salts, as, sources, of, colour, in, fireworks, under, intense, heat, the, electrons, in, the, metal, ions, or, small, molecules, can, be, excited, these, electrons, later, return, to, lower, energy, states, and, release, light, with, a, colour, spectrum, characteristic, of, the, species, present, in, chemical, synthesis, salts, are, often, used, as, precursors, for, high, temperature, solid, state, synthesis, many, metals, are, geologically, most, abundant, as, salts, within, ores, to, obtain, the, elemental, materials, these, ores, are, processed, by, smelting, or, electrolysis, in, which, redox, reactions, occur, often, with, a, reducing, agent, such, as, carbon, such, that, the, metal, ions, gain, electrons, to, become, neutral, atoms, according, to, the, nomenclature, recommended, by, iupac, salts, are, named, according, to, their, composition, not, their, structure, in, the, most, simple, case, of, a, binary, salt, with, no, possible, ambiguity, about, the, charges, and, thus, the, stoichiometry, the, common, name, is, written, using, two, words, the, name, of, the, cation, the, unmodified, element, name, for, monatomic, cations, comes, first, followed, by, the, name, of, the, anion, for, example, mgcl, 2, is, named, magnesium, chloride, and, na, 2, so, 4, is, named, sodium, sulfate, so, 2, 4, sulfate, is, an, example, of, a, polyatomic, ion, to, obtain, the, empirical, formula, from, these, names, the, stoichiometry, can, be, deduced, from, the, charges, on, the, ions, and, the, requirement, of, overall, charge, neutrality, if, there, are, multiple, different, cations, and, or, anions, multiplicative, prefixes, di, tri, tetra, are, often, required, to, indicate, the, relative, compositions, and, cations, then, anions, are, listed, in, alphabetical, order, for, example, kmgcl, 3, is, named, magnesium, potassium, trichloride, to, distinguish, it, from, k, 2, mgcl, 4, magnesium, dipotassium, tetrachloride, note, that, in, both, the, empirical, formula, and, the, written, name, the, cations, appear, in, alphabetical, order, but, the, order, varies, between, them, because, the, symbol, for, potassium, is, k, when, one, of, the, ions, already, has, a, multiplicative, prefix, within, its, name, the, alternate, multiplicative, prefixes, bis, tris, tetrakis, are, used, for, example, ba, brf, 4, 2, is, named, barium, bis, tetrafluoridobromate, compounds, containing, one, or, more, elements, which, can, exist, in, a, variety, of, charge, oxidation, states, will, have, a, stoichiometry, that, depends, on, which, oxidation, states, are, present, to, ensure, overall, neutrality, this, can, be, indicated, in, the, name, by, specifying, either, the, oxidation, state, of, the, elements, present, or, the, charge, on, the, ions, because, of, the, risk, of, ambiguity, in, allocating, oxidation, states, iupac, prefers, direct, indication, of, the, ionic, charge, numbers, these, are, written, as, an, arabic, integer, followed, by, the, sign, 2, 1, 1, 2, in, parentheses, directly, after, the, name, of, the, cation, without, a, space, separating, them, for, example, feso, 4, is, named, iron, 2, sulfate, with, the, 2, charge, on, the, fe, 2, ions, balancing, the, 2, charge, on, the, sulfate, ion, whereas, fe, 2, so, 4, 3, is, named, iron, 3, sulfate, because, the, two, iron, ions, in, each, formula, unit, each, have, a, charge, of, 3, to, balance, the, 2, on, each, of, the, three, sulfate, ions, stock, nomenclature, still, in, common, use, writes, the, oxidation, number, in, roman, numerals, ii, i, 0, i, ii, so, the, examples, given, above, would, be, named, iron, ii, sulfate, and, iron, iii, sulfate, respectively, for, simple, ions, the, ionic, charge, and, the, oxidation, number, are, identical, but, for, polyatomic, ions, they, often, differ, for, example, the, uranyl, 2, ion, uo, 2, 2, has, uranium, in, an, oxidation, state, of, 6, so, would, be, called, a, dioxouranium, vi, ion, in, stock, nomenclature, an, even, older, naming, system, for, metal, cations, also, still, widely, used, appended, the, suffixes, ous, and, ic, to, the, latin, root, of, the, name, to, give, special, names, for, the, low, and, high, oxidation, states, for, example, this, scheme, uses, ferrous, and, ferric, for, iron, ii, and, iron, iii, respectively, so, the, examples, given, above, were, classically, named, ferrous, sulfate, and, ferric, sulfate, common, salt, forming, cations, include, common, salt, forming, anions, parent, acids, in, parentheses, where, available, include, salts, with, varying, number, of, hydrogen, atoms, replaced, by, cations, as, compared, to, their, parent, acid, can, be, referred, to, as, monobasic, dibasic, or, tribasic, identifying, that, one, two, or, three, hydrogen, atoms, have, been, replaced, polybasic, salts, refer, to, those, with, more, than, one, hydrogen, atom, replaced, examples, include, strong, salts, or, strong, electrolyte, salts, are, chemical, salts, composed, of, strong, electrolytes, these, salts, dissociate, completely, or, almost, completely, in, water, they, are, generally, odorless, and, nonvolatile, strong, salts, start, with, na, k, nh, 4, or, they, end, with, no, 3, clo, 4, or, ch, 3, coo, most, group, 1, and, 2, metals, form, strong, salts, strong, salts, are, especially, useful, when, creating, conductive, compounds, as, their, constituent, ions, allow, for, greater, conductivity, weak, salts, or, weak, electrolyte, salts, are, composed, of, weak, electrolytes, these, salts, do, not, dissociate, well, in, water, they, are, generally, more, volatile, than, strong, salts, they, may, be, similar, in, odor, to, the, acid, or, base, they, are, derived, from, for, example, sodium, acetate, ch, 3, coona, smells, similar, to, acetic, acid, ch, 3, cooh, zwitterions, contain, an, anionic, and, a, cationic, centre, in, the, same, molecule, but, are, not, considered, salts, examples, of, zwitterions, are, amino, acids, many, metabolites, peptides, and, proteins
