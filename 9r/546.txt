wrought, iron, is, an, iron, alloy, with, a, very, low, carbon, content, less, than, 0, 05, in, contrast, to, that, of, cast, iron, 2, 1, to, 4, 5, it, is, a, semi, fused, mass, of, iron, with, fibrous, slag, inclusions, up, to, 2, by, weight, which, give, it, a, wood, like, grain, that, is, visible, when, it, is, etched, rusted, or, bent, to, failure, wrought, iron, is, tough, malleable, ductile, corrosion, resistant, and, easily, forge, welded, but, is, more, difficult, to, weld, electrically, before, the, development, of, effective, methods, of, steelmaking, and, the, availability, of, large, quantities, of, steel, wrought, iron, was, the, most, common, form, of, malleable, iron, it, was, given, the, name, wrought, because, it, was, hammered, rolled, or, otherwise, worked, while, hot, enough, to, expel, molten, slag, the, modern, functional, equivalent, of, wrought, iron, is, mild, steel, also, called, low, carbon, steel, neither, wrought, iron, nor, mild, steel, contain, enough, carbon, to, be, hardened, by, heating, and, quenching, 145, wrought, iron, is, highly, refined, with, a, small, amount, of, silicate, slag, forged, out, into, fibers, it, comprises, around, 99, 4, iron, by, mass, the, presence, of, slag, can, be, beneficial, for, blacksmithing, operations, such, as, forge, welding, since, the, silicate, inclusions, act, as, a, flux, and, give, the, material, its, unique, fibrous, structure, the, silicate, filaments, in, the, slag, also, protect, the, iron, from, corrosion, and, diminish, the, effect, of, fatigue, caused, by, shock, and, vibration, historically, a, modest, amount, of, wrought, iron, was, refined, into, steel, which, was, used, mainly, to, produce, swords, cutlery, chisels, axes, and, other, edged, tools, as, well, as, springs, and, files, the, demand, for, wrought, iron, reached, its, peak, in, the, 1860s, being, in, high, demand, for, ironclad, warships, and, railway, use, however, as, properties, such, as, brittleness, of, mild, steel, improved, with, better, ferrous, metallurgy, and, as, steel, became, less, costly, to, make, thanks, to, the, bessemer, process, and, the, siemens, martin, process, the, use, of, wrought, iron, declined, many, items, before, they, came, to, be, made, of, mild, steel, were, produced, from, wrought, iron, including, rivets, nails, wire, chains, rails, railway, couplings, water, and, steam, pipes, nuts, bolts, horseshoes, handrails, wagon, tires, straps, for, timber, roof, trusses, and, ornamental, ironwork, among, many, other, things, wrought, iron, is, no, longer, produced, on, a, commercial, scale, many, products, described, as, wrought, iron, such, as, guard, rails, garden, furniture, and, gates, are, made, of, mild, steel, they, are, described, as, wrought, iron, only, because, they, have, been, made, to, resemble, objects, which, in, the, past, were, wrought, worked, by, hand, by, a, blacksmith, although, many, decorative, iron, objects, including, fences, and, gates, were, often, cast, rather, than, wrought, the, word, wrought, is, an, archaic, past, participle, of, the, verb, to, work, and, so, wrought, iron, literally, means, worked, iron, wrought, iron, is, a, general, term, for, the, commodity, but, is, also, used, more, specifically, for, finished, iron, goods, as, manufactured, by, a, blacksmith, it, was, used, in, that, narrower, sense, in, british, customs, records, such, manufactured, iron, was, subject, to, a, higher, rate, of, duty, than, what, might, be, called, unwrought, iron, cast, iron, unlike, wrought, iron, is, brittle, and, cannot, be, worked, either, hot, or, cold, in, the, 17th, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, wrought, iron, went, by, a, wide, variety, of, terms, according, to, its, form, origin, or, quality, while, the, bloomery, process, produced, wrought, iron, directly, from, ore, cast, iron, or, pig, iron, were, the, starting, materials, used, in, the, finery, forge, and, puddling, furnace, pig, iron, and, cast, iron, have, higher, carbon, content, than, wrought, iron, but, have, a, lower, melting, point, than, iron, or, steel, cast, and, especially, pig, iron, have, excess, slag, which, must, be, at, least, partially, removed, to, produce, quality, wrought, iron, at, foundries, it, was, common, to, blend, scrap, wrought, iron, with, cast, iron, to, improve, the, physical, properties, of, castings, for, several, years, after, the, introduction, of, bessemer, and, open, hearth, steel, there, were, different, opinions, as, to, what, differentiated, iron, from, steel, some, believed, it, was, the, chemical, composition, and, others, that, it, was, whether, the, iron, heated, sufficiently, to, melt, and, fuse, fusion, eventually, became, generally, accepted, as, relatively, more, important, than, composition, below, a, given, low, carbon, concentration, 32, 39, another, difference, is, that, steel, can, be, hardened, by, heat, treating, historically, wrought, iron, was, known, as, commercially, pure, iron, however, it, no, longer, qualifies, because, current, standards, for, commercially, pure, iron, require, a, carbon, content, of, less, than, 0, 008, wt, bar, iron, is, a, generic, term, sometimes, used, to, distinguish, it, from, cast, iron, it, is, the, equivalent, of, an, ingot, of, cast, metal, in, a, convenient, form, for, handling, storage, shipping, and, further, working, into, a, finished, product, the, bars, were, the, usual, product, of, the, finery, forge, but, not, necessarily, made, by, that, process, wrought, iron, is, a, form, of, commercial, iron, containing, less, than, 0, 10, of, carbon, less, than, 0, 25, of, impurities, total, of, sulfur, phosphorus, silicon, and, manganese, and, less, than, 2, slag, by, weight, wrought, iron, is, redshort, or, hot, short, if, it, contains, sulfur, in, excess, quantity, it, has, sufficient, tenacity, when, cold, but, cracks, when, bent, or, finished, at, a, red, heat, 7, hot, short, iron, was, considered, unmarketable, cold, short, iron, also, known, as, coldshear, colshire, contains, excessive, phosphorus, it, is, very, brittle, when, cold, and, cracks, if, bent, 7, 215, it, may, however, be, worked, at, high, temperature, historically, coldshort, iron, was, considered, sufficient, for, nails, phosphorus, is, not, necessarily, detrimental, to, iron, ancient, near, eastern, smiths, did, not, add, lime, to, their, furnaces, the, absence, of, calcium, oxide, in, the, slag, and, the, deliberate, use, of, wood, with, high, phosphorus, content, during, the, smelting, induces, a, higher, phosphorus, content, typically, 0, 3, than, in, modern, iron, 0, 02, 0, 03, analysis, of, the, iron, pillar, of, delhi, gives, 0, 11, in, the, iron, 69, the, included, slag, in, wrought, iron, also, imparts, corrosion, resistance, antique, music, wire, manufactured, at, a, time, when, mass, produced, carbon, steels, were, available, was, found, to, have, low, carbon, and, high, phosphorus, iron, with, high, phosphorus, content, normally, causing, brittleness, when, worked, cold, was, easily, drawn, into, music, wires, although, at, the, time, phosphorus, was, not, an, easily, identified, component, of, iron, it, was, hypothesized, that, the, type, of, iron, had, been, rejected, for, conversion, to, steel, but, excelled, when, tested, for, drawing, ability, during, the, han, dynasty, 202, bc, 220, ad, new, iron, smelting, processes, led, to, the, manufacture, of, new, wrought, iron, implements, for, use, in, agriculture, such, as, the, multi, tube, seed, drill, and, iron, plough, in, addition, to, accidental, lumps, of, low, carbon, wrought, iron, produced, by, excessive, injected, air, in, ancient, chinese, cupola, furnaces, the, ancient, chinese, created, wrought, iron, by, using, the, finery, forge, at, least, by, the, 2nd, century, bc, the, earliest, specimens, of, cast, and, pig, iron, fined, into, wrought, iron, and, steel, found, at, the, early, han, dynasty, site, at, tieshengguo, 186, pigott, speculates, that, the, finery, forge, existed, in, the, previous, warring, states, period, 403, 221, bc, due, to, the, fact, that, there, are, wrought, iron, items, from, china, dating, to, that, period, and, there, is, no, documented, evidence, of, the, bloomery, ever, being, used, in, china, 186, 187, the, fining, process, involved, liquifying, cast, iron, in, a, fining, hearth, and, removing, carbon, from, the, molten, cast, iron, through, oxidation, 186, wagner, writes, that, in, addition, to, the, han, dynasty, hearths, believed, to, be, fining, hearths, there, is, also, pictorial, evidence, of, the, fining, hearth, from, a, shandong, tomb, mural, dated, 1st, to, 2nd, century, ad, as, well, as, a, hint, of, written, evidence, in, the, 4th, century, ad, daoist, text, taiping, jing, wrought, iron, has, been, used, for, many, centuries, and, is, the, iron, that, is, referred, to, throughout, western, history, the, other, form, of, iron, cast, iron, was, in, use, in, china, since, ancient, times, but, was, not, introduced, into, western, europe, until, the, 15th, century, even, then, due, to, its, brittleness, it, could, be, used, for, only, a, limited, number, of, purposes, throughout, much, of, the, middle, ages, iron, was, produced, by, the, direct, reduction, of, ore, in, manually, operated, bloomeries, although, water, power, had, begun, to, be, employed, by, 1104, the, raw, material, produced, by, all, indirect, processes, is, pig, iron, it, has, a, high, carbon, content, and, as, a, consequence, it, is, brittle, and, cannot, be, used, to, make, hardware, the, osmond, process, was, the, first, of, the, indirect, processes, developed, by, 1203, but, bloomery, production, continued, in, many, places, the, process, depended, on, the, development, of, the, blast, furnace, of, which, medieval, examples, have, been, discovered, at, lapphyttan, sweden, and, in, germany, the, bloomery, and, osmond, processes, were, gradually, replaced, from, the, 15th, century, by, finery, processes, of, which, there, were, two, versions, the, german, and, walloon, they, were, in, turn, replaced, from, the, late, 18th, century, by, puddling, with, certain, variants, such, as, the, swedish, lancashire, process, those, too, are, now, obsolete, and, wrought, iron, is, no, longer, manufactured, commercially, wrought, iron, was, originally, produced, by, a, variety, of, smelting, processes, all, described, today, as, bloomeries, different, forms, of, bloomery, were, used, at, different, places, and, times, the, bloomery, was, charged, with, charcoal, and, iron, ore, and, then, lit, air, was, blown, in, through, a, tuyere, to, heat, the, bloomery, to, a, temperature, somewhat, below, the, melting, point, of, iron, in, the, course, of, the, smelt, slag, would, melt, and, run, out, and, carbon, monoxide, from, the, charcoal, would, reduce, the, ore, to, iron, which, formed, a, spongy, mass, called, a, bloom, containing, iron, and, also, molten, silicate, minerals, slag, from, the, ore, the, iron, remained, in, the, solid, state, if, the, bloomery, were, allowed, to, become, hot, enough, to, melt, the, iron, carbon, would, dissolve, into, it, and, form, pig, or, cast, iron, but, that, was, not, the, intention, however, the, design, of, a, bloomery, made, it, difficult, to, reach, the, melting, point, of, iron, and, also, prevented, the, concentration, of, carbon, monoxide, from, becoming, high, 46, 57, after, smelting, was, complete, the, bloom, was, removed, and, the, process, could, then, be, started, again, it, was, thus, a, batch, process, rather, than, a, continuous, one, such, as, a, blast, furnace, the, bloom, had, to, be, forged, mechanically, to, consolidate, it, and, shape, it, into, a, bar, expelling, slag, in, the, process, 62, 66, during, the, middle, ages, water, power, was, applied, to, the, process, probably, initially, for, powering, bellows, and, only, later, to, hammers, for, forging, the, blooms, however, while, it, is, certain, that, water, power, was, used, the, details, remain, uncertain, 75, 76, that, was, the, culmination, of, the, direct, process, of, ironmaking, it, survived, in, spain, and, southern, france, as, catalan, forges, to, the, mid, 19th, century, in, austria, as, the, stuckofen, to, 1775, 100, 101, and, near, garstang, in, england, until, about, 1770, it, was, still, in, use, with, hot, blast, in, new, york, in, the, 1880s, in, japan, the, last, of, the, old, tatara, bloomeries, used, in, production, of, traditional, tamahagane, steel, mainly, used, in, swordmaking, was, extinguished, only, in, 1925, though, in, the, late, 20th, century, the, production, resumed, on, a, low, scale, to, supply, the, steel, to, the, artisan, swordmakers, osmond, iron, consisted, of, balls, of, wrought, iron, produced, by, melting, pig, iron, and, catching, the, droplets, on, a, staff, which, was, spun, in, front, of, a, blast, of, air, so, as, to, expose, as, much, of, it, as, possible, to, the, air, and, oxidise, its, carbon, content, the, resultant, ball, was, often, forged, into, bar, iron, in, a, hammer, mill, in, the, 15th, century, the, blast, furnace, spread, into, what, is, now, belgium, where, it, was, improved, from, there, it, spread, via, the, pays, de, bray, on, the, boundary, of, normandy, and, then, to, the, weald, in, england, with, it, the, finery, forge, spread, those, remelted, the, pig, iron, and, in, effect, burnt, out, the, carbon, producing, a, bloom, which, was, then, forged, into, bar, iron, if, rod, iron, was, required, a, slitting, mill, was, used, the, finery, process, existed, in, two, slightly, different, forms, in, great, britain, france, and, parts, of, sweden, only, the, walloon, process, was, used, that, employed, two, different, hearths, a, finery, hearth, for, finishing, the, iron, and, a, chafery, hearth, for, reheating, it, in, the, course, of, drawing, the, bloom, out, into, a, bar, the, finery, always, burnt, charcoal, but, the, chafery, could, be, fired, with, mineral, coal, since, its, impurities, would, not, harm, the, iron, when, it, was, in, the, solid, state, on, the, other, hand, the, german, process, used, in, germany, russia, and, most, of, sweden, used, a, single, hearth, for, all, stages, the, introduction, of, coke, for, use, in, the, blast, furnace, by, abraham, darby, in, 1709, or, perhaps, others, a, little, earlier, initially, had, little, effect, on, wrought, iron, production, only, in, the, 1750s, was, coke, pig, iron, used, on, any, significant, scale, as, the, feedstock, of, finery, forges, however, charcoal, continued, to, be, the, fuel, for, the, finery, from, the, late, 1750s, ironmasters, began, to, develop, processes, for, making, bar, iron, without, charcoal, there, were, a, number, of, patented, processes, for, that, which, are, referred, to, today, as, potting, and, stamping, the, earliest, were, developed, by, john, wood, of, wednesbury, and, his, brother, charles, wood, of, low, mill, at, egremont, patented, in, 1763, 723, 724, another, was, developed, for, the, coalbrookdale, company, by, the, cranage, brothers, another, important, one, was, that, of, john, wright, and, joseph, jesson, of, west, bromwich, 725, 726, a, number, of, processes, for, making, wrought, iron, without, charcoal, were, devised, as, the, industrial, revolution, began, during, the, latter, half, of, the, 18th, century, the, most, successful, of, those, was, puddling, using, a, puddling, furnace, a, variety, of, the, reverberatory, furnace, which, was, invented, by, henry, cort, in, 1784, it, was, later, improved, by, others, including, joseph, hall, who, was, the, first, to, add, iron, oxide, to, the, charge, in, that, type, of, furnace, the, metal, does, not, come, into, contact, with, the, fuel, and, so, is, not, contaminated, by, its, impurities, the, heat, of, the, combustion, products, passes, over, the, surface, of, the, puddle, and, the, roof, of, the, furnace, reverberates, reflects, the, heat, onto, the, metal, puddle, on, the, fire, bridge, of, the, furnace, unless, the, raw, material, used, is, white, cast, iron, the, pig, iron, or, other, raw, product, of, the, puddling, first, had, to, be, refined, into, refined, iron, or, finers, metal, that, would, be, done, in, a, refinery, where, raw, coal, was, used, to, remove, silicon, and, convert, carbon, within, the, raw, material, found, in, the, form, of, graphite, to, a, combination, with, iron, called, cementite, in, the, fully, developed, process, of, hall, this, metal, was, placed, into, the, hearth, of, the, puddling, furnace, where, it, was, melted, the, hearth, was, lined, with, oxidizing, agents, such, as, haematite, and, iron, oxide, the, mixture, was, subjected, to, a, strong, current, of, air, and, stirred, with, long, bars, called, puddling, bars, or, rabbles, 165, through, working, doors, 236, 240, the, air, the, stirring, and, the, boiling, action, of, the, metal, helped, the, oxidizing, agents, to, oxidize, the, impurities, and, carbon, out, of, the, pig, iron, as, the, impurities, oxidize, they, formed, a, molten, slag, or, drifted, off, as, gas, while, the, remaining, iron, solidified, into, spongy, wrought, iron, that, floated, to, the, top, of, the, puddle, and, was, fished, out, of, the, melt, as, puddle, balls, using, puddle, bars, there, was, still, some, slag, left, in, the, puddle, balls, so, while, they, were, still, hot, they, would, be, shingled, to, remove, the, remaining, slag, and, cinder, that, was, achieved, by, forging, the, balls, under, a, hammer, or, by, squeezing, the, bloom, in, a, machine, the, material, obtained, at, the, end, of, shingling, is, known, as, bloom, the, blooms, are, not, useful, in, that, form, so, they, were, rolled, into, a, final, product, sometimes, european, ironworks, would, skip, the, shingling, process, completely, and, roll, the, puddle, balls, the, only, drawback, to, that, is, that, the, edges, of, the, rough, bars, were, not, as, well, compressed, when, the, rough, bar, was, reheated, the, edges, might, separate, and, be, lost, into, the, furnace, the, bloom, was, passed, through, rollers, and, to, produce, bars, the, bars, of, wrought, iron, were, of, poor, quality, called, muck, bars, 137, or, puddle, bars, to, improve, their, quality, the, bars, were, cut, up, piled, and, tied, together, by, wires, a, process, known, as, faggoting, or, piling, they, were, then, reheated, to, a, welding, state, forge, welded, and, rolled, again, into, bars, the, process, could, be, repeated, several, times, to, produce, wrought, iron, of, desired, quality, wrought, iron, that, has, been, rolled, multiple, times, is, called, merchant, bar, or, merchant, iron, the, advantage, of, puddling, was, that, it, used, coal, not, charcoal, as, fuel, however, that, was, of, little, advantage, in, sweden, which, lacked, coal, gustaf, ekman, observed, charcoal, fineries, at, ulverston, which, were, quite, different, from, any, in, sweden, after, his, return, to, sweden, in, the, 1830s, he, experimented, and, developed, a, process, similar, to, puddling, but, used, firewood, and, charcoal, which, was, widely, adopted, in, the, bergslagen, in, the, following, decades, 282, 285, in, 1925, james, aston, of, the, united, states, developed, a, process, for, manufacturing, wrought, iron, quickly, and, economically, it, involved, taking, molten, steel, from, a, bessemer, converter, and, pouring, it, into, cooler, liquid, slag, the, temperature, of, the, steel, is, about, 1500, c, and, the, liquid, slag, is, maintained, at, approximately, 1200, c, the, molten, steel, contains, a, large, amount, of, dissolved, gases, so, when, the, liquid, steel, hit, the, cooler, surfaces, of, the, liquid, slag, the, gases, were, liberated, the, molten, steel, then, froze, to, yield, a, spongy, mass, having, a, temperature, of, about, 1370, c, the, spongy, mass, would, then, be, finished, by, being, shingled, and, rolled, as, described, under, puddling, above, three, to, four, tons, could, be, converted, per, batch, with, the, method, steel, began, to, replace, iron, for, railroad, rails, as, soon, as, the, bessemer, process, for, its, manufacture, was, adopted, 1865, on, iron, remained, dominant, for, structural, applications, until, the, 1880s, because, of, problems, with, brittle, steel, caused, by, introduced, nitrogen, high, carbon, excess, phosphorus, or, excessive, temperature, during, or, too, rapid, rolling, 144, 151, by, 1890, steel, had, largely, replaced, iron, for, structural, applications, sheet, iron, armco, 99, 97, pure, iron, had, good, properties, for, use, in, appliances, being, well, suited, for, enamelling, and, welding, and, being, rust, resistant, 242, in, the, 1960s, the, price, of, steel, production, was, dropping, due, to, recycling, and, even, using, the, aston, process, wrought, iron, production, was, labor, intensive, it, has, been, estimated, that, the, production, of, wrought, iron, is, approximately, twice, as, expensive, as, that, of, low, carbon, steel, in, the, united, states, the, last, plant, closed, in, 1969, the, last, in, the, world, was, the, atlas, forge, of, thomas, walmsley, and, sons, in, bolton, great, britain, which, closed, in, 1973, its, 1860s, era, equipment, was, moved, to, the, blists, hill, site, of, ironbridge, gorge, museum, for, preservation, some, wrought, iron, is, still, being, produced, for, heritage, restoration, purposes, but, only, by, recycling, scrap, the, slag, inclusions, or, stringers, in, wrought, iron, give, it, properties, not, found, in, other, forms, of, ferrous, metal, there, are, approximately, 250, 000, inclusions, per, square, inch, a, fresh, fracture, shows, a, clear, bluish, color, with, a, high, silky, luster, and, fibrous, appearance, wrought, iron, lacks, the, carbon, content, necessary, for, hardening, through, heat, treatment, but, in, areas, where, steel, was, uncommon, or, unknown, tools, were, sometimes, cold, worked, hence, cold, iron, to, harden, them, an, advantage, of, its, low, carbon, content, is, its, excellent, weldability, furthermore, sheet, wrought, iron, cannot, bend, as, much, as, steel, sheet, metal, when, cold, worked, wrought, iron, can, be, melted, and, cast, however, the, product, is, no, longer, wrought, iron, since, the, slag, stringers, characteristic, of, wrought, iron, disappear, on, melting, so, the, product, resembles, impure, cast, bessemer, steel, there, is, no, engineering, advantage, to, melting, and, casting, wrought, iron, as, compared, to, using, cast, iron, or, steel, both, of, which, are, cheaper, due, to, the, variations, in, iron, ore, origin, and, iron, manufacture, wrought, iron, can, be, inferior, or, superior, in, corrosion, resistance, compared, to, other, iron, alloys, there, are, many, mechanisms, behind, its, corrosion, resistance, chilton, and, evans, found, that, nickel, enrichment, bands, reduce, corrosion, they, also, found, that, in, puddled, forged, and, piled, iron, the, working, over, of, the, metal, spread, out, copper, nickel, and, tin, impurities, that, produce, electrochemical, conditions, that, slow, down, corrosion, the, slag, inclusions, have, been, shown, to, disperse, corrosion, to, an, even, film, enabling, the, iron, to, resist, pitting, another, study, has, shown, that, slag, inclusions, are, pathways, to, corrosion, other, studies, show, that, sulfur, in, the, wrought, iron, decreases, corrosion, resistance, while, phosphorus, increases, corrosion, resistance, chloride, ions, also, decrease, wrought, iron, s, corrosion, resistance, wrought, iron, may, be, welded, in, the, same, manner, as, mild, steel, but, the, presence, of, oxide, or, inclusions, will, give, defective, results, the, material, has, a, rough, surface, so, it, can, hold, platings, and, coatings, better, than, smooth, steel, for, instance, a, galvanic, zinc, finish, applied, to, wrought, iron, is, approximately, 25, 40, thicker, than, the, same, finish, on, steel, in, table, 1, the, chemical, composition, of, wrought, iron, is, compared, to, that, of, pig, iron, and, carbon, steel, although, it, appears, that, wrought, iron, and, plain, carbon, steel, have, similar, chemical, compositions, that, is, deceptive, most, of, the, manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and, silicon, in, the, wrought, iron, are, incorporated, into, the, slag, fibers, making, wrought, iron, purer, than, plain, carbon, steel, amongst, its, other, properties, wrought, iron, becomes, soft, at, red, heat, and, can, be, easily, forged, and, forge, welded, it, can, be, used, to, form, temporary, magnets, but, it, cannot, be, magnetized, permanently, and, is, ductile, malleable, and, tough, for, most, purposes, ductility, rather, than, tensile, strength, is, a, more, important, measure, of, the, quality, of, wrought, iron, in, tensile, testing, the, best, irons, are, able, to, undergo, considerable, elongation, before, failure, higher, tensile, wrought, iron, is, brittle, because, of, the, large, number, of, boiler, explosions, on, steamboats, in, the, early, 1800s, the, u, s, congress, passed, legislation, in, 1830, which, approved, funds, for, correcting, the, problem, the, treasury, awarded, a, 1500, contract, to, the, franklin, institute, to, conduct, a, study, as, part, of, the, study, walter, r, johnson, and, benjamin, reeves, conducted, strength, tests, on, boiler, iron, using, a, tester, they, had, built, in, 1832, based, on, a, design, by, lagerhjelm, in, sweden, because, of, misunderstandings, about, tensile, strength, and, ductility, their, work, did, little, to, reduce, failures, the, importance, of, ductility, was, recognized, by, some, very, early, in, the, development, of, tube, boilers, evidenced, by, thurston, s, comment, if, made, of, such, good, iron, as, the, makers, claimed, to, have, put, into, them, which, worked, like, lead, they, would, as, also, claimed, when, ruptured, open, by, tearing, and, discharge, their, contents, without, producing, the, usual, disastrous, consequences, of, a, boiler, explosion, various, 19th, century, investigations, of, boiler, explosions, especially, those, by, insurance, companies, found, causes, to, be, most, commonly, the, result, of, operating, boilers, above, the, safe, pressure, range, either, to, get, more, power, or, due, to, defective, boiler, pressure, relief, valves, and, difficulties, of, obtaining, reliable, indications, of, pressure, and, water, levels, poor, fabrication, was, also, a, common, problem, also, the, thickness, of, the, iron, in, steam, drums, was, low, by, modern, standards, by, the, late, 19th, century, when, metallurgists, were, able, to, better, understand, what, properties, and, processes, made, good, iron, iron, in, steam, engines, was, being, displaced, by, steel, also, the, old, cylindrical, boilers, with, fire, tubes, were, displaced, by, water, tube, boilers, which, are, inherently, safer, in, 2010, gerry, mcdonnell, demonstrated, in, england, by, analysis, that, a, wrought, iron, bloom, from, a, traditional, smelt, could, be, worked, into, 99, 7, pure, iron, with, no, evidence, of, carbon, it, was, found, that, the, stringers, common, to, other, wrought, irons, were, not, present, thus, making, it, very, malleable, for, the, smith, to, work, hot, and, cold, a, commercial, source, of, pure, iron, is, available, and, is, used, by, smiths, as, an, alternative, to, traditional, wrought, iron, and, other, new, generation, ferrous, metals, wrought, iron, furniture, has, a, long, history, dating, back, to, roman, times, there, are, 13th, century, wrought, iron, gates, in, westminster, abbey, in, london, and, wrought, iron, furniture, seemed, to, reach, its, peak, popularity, in, britain, in, the, 17th, century, during, the, reign, of, william, iii, and, mary, ii, however, cast, iron, and, cheaper, steel, caused, a, gradual, decline, in, wrought, iron, manufacture, the, last, wrought, ironworks, in, britain, closed, in, 1974, it, is, also, used, to, make, home, decor, items, such, as, baker, s, racks, wine, racks, pot, racks, etageres, table, bases, desks, gates, beds, candle, holders, curtain, rods, bars, and, bar, stools, the, vast, majority, of, wrought, iron, available, today, is, from, reclaimed, materials, old, bridges, and, anchor, chains, dredged, from, harbors, are, major, sources, the, greater, corrosion, resistance, of, wrought, iron, is, due, to, the, siliceous, impurities, naturally, occurring, in, iron, ore, namely, ferrous, silicate, wrought, iron, has, been, used, for, decades, as, a, generic, term, across, the, gate, and, fencing, industry, even, though, mild, steel, is, used, for, manufacturing, these, wrought, iron, gates, this, is, mainly, because, of, the, limited, availability, of, true, wrought, iron, steel, can, also, be, hot, dip, galvanised, to, prevent, corrosion, which, cannot, be, done, with, wrought, iron
