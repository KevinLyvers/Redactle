nitrous, oxide, dinitrogen, oxide, or, dinitrogen, monoxide, commonly, known, as, laughing, gas, nitrous, nitro, or, nos, is, a, chemical, compound, an, oxide, of, nitrogen, with, the, formula, n, 2, o, at, room, temperature, it, is, a, colourless, non, flammable, gas, and, has, a, slightly, sweet, scent, and, taste, at, elevated, temperatures, nitrous, oxide, is, a, powerful, oxidiser, similar, to, molecular, oxygen, nitrous, oxide, has, significant, medical, uses, especially, in, surgery, and, dentistry, for, its, anaesthetic, and, pain, reducing, effects, its, colloquial, name, laughing, gas, coined, by, humphry, davy, is, due, to, the, euphoric, effects, upon, inhaling, it, a, property, that, has, led, to, its, recreational, use, as, a, dissociative, anaesthetic, it, is, on, the, world, health, organization, s, list, of, essential, medicines, it, is, also, used, as, an, oxidiser, in, rocket, propellants, and, in, motor, racing, to, increase, the, power, output, of, engines, nitrous, oxide, s, atmospheric, concentration, reached, 333, parts, per, billion, ppb, in, 2020, increasing, at, a, rate, of, about, 1, ppb, annually, it, is, a, major, scavenger, of, stratospheric, ozone, with, an, impact, comparable, to, that, of, cfcs, about, 40, of, human, caused, emissions, are, from, agriculture, nitrogen, is, added, to, the, soil, via, animal, urine, and, dung, and, synthetic, fertilisers, micro, organisms, then, release, it, in, nitrous, oxide, being, the, third, most, important, greenhouse, gas, nitrous, oxide, substantially, contributes, to, global, warming, reduction, of, emissions, is, a, popular, topic, in, the, politics, of, climate, change, nitrous, oxide, is, used, as, a, propellant, and, has, a, variety, of, applications, from, rocketry, to, making, whipped, cream, it, is, used, as, a, recreational, drug, for, its, potential, to, induce, a, brief, high, when, used, chronically, nitrous, oxide, has, the, potential, to, cause, neurological, damage, through, inactivation, of, vitamin, b, 12, nitrous, oxide, may, be, used, as, an, oxidiser, in, a, rocket, motor, it, has, advantages, over, other, oxidisers, in, that, it, is, much, less, toxic, and, because, of, its, stability, at, room, temperature, it, is, also, easier, to, store, and, relatively, safe, to, carry, on, a, flight, as, a, secondary, benefit, it, may, be, decomposed, readily, to, form, breathing, air, its, high, density, and, low, storage, pressure, when, maintained, at, low, temperatures, enable, it, to, be, highly, competitive, with, stored, high, pressure, gas, systems, in, a, 1914, patent, american, rocket, pioneer, robert, goddard, suggested, nitrous, oxide, and, gasoline, as, possible, propellants, for, a, liquid, fuelled, rocket, nitrous, oxide, has, been, the, oxidiser, of, choice, in, several, hybrid, rocket, designs, using, solid, fuel, with, a, liquid, or, gaseous, oxidiser, the, combination, of, nitrous, oxide, with, hydroxyl, terminated, polybutadiene, fuel, has, been, used, by, spaceshipone, and, others, it, also, is, notably, used, in, amateur, and, high, power, rocketry, with, various, plastics, as, the, fuel, nitrous, oxide, also, may, be, used, in, a, monopropellant, rocket, in, the, presence, of, a, heated, catalyst, n, 2, o, will, decompose, exothermically, into, nitrogen, and, oxygen, at, a, temperature, of, approximately, 1, 070, f, 577, c, because, of, the, large, heat, release, the, catalytic, action, rapidly, becomes, secondary, as, thermal, autodecomposition, becomes, dominant, in, a, vacuum, thruster, this, may, provide, a, monopropellant, specific, impulse, i, sp, of, as, much, as, 180, s, while, noticeably, less, than, the, i, sp, available, from, hydrazine, thrusters, monopropellant, or, bipropellant, with, dinitrogen, tetroxide, the, decreased, toxicity, makes, nitrous, oxide, an, option, worth, investigating, nitrous, oxide, is, said, to, deflagrate, at, approximately, 600, c, 1, 112, f, at, a, pressure, of, 309, psi, 21, atmospheres, at, 600, psi, for, example, the, required, ignition, energy, is, only, 6, joules, whereas, n, 2, o, at, 130, psi, a, 2, 500, joule, ignition, energy, input, is, insufficient, in, vehicle, racing, nitrous, oxide, often, called, nitrous, allows, the, engine, to, burn, more, fuel, by, providing, more, oxygen, during, combustion, the, increase, in, oxygen, allows, an, increase, in, the, injection, of, fuel, allowing, the, engine, to, produce, more, engine, power, the, gas, is, not, flammable, at, a, low, pressure, temperature, but, it, delivers, more, oxygen, than, atmospheric, air, by, breaking, down, at, elevated, temperatures, about, 570, degrees, f, 300c, therefore, it, often, is, mixed, with, another, fuel, that, is, easier, to, deflagrate, nitrous, oxide, is, a, strong, oxidising, agent, roughly, equivalent, to, hydrogen, peroxide, and, much, stronger, than, oxygen, gas, nitrous, oxide, is, stored, as, a, compressed, liquid, the, evaporation, and, expansion, of, liquid, nitrous, oxide, in, the, intake, manifold, causes, a, large, drop, in, intake, charge, temperature, resulting, in, a, denser, charge, further, allowing, more, air, fuel, mixture, to, enter, the, cylinder, sometimes, nitrous, oxide, is, injected, into, or, prior, to, the, intake, manifold, whereas, other, systems, directly, inject, right, before, the, cylinder, direct, port, injection, to, increase, power, the, technique, was, used, during, world, war, ii, by, luftwaffe, aircraft, with, the, gm, 1, system, to, boost, the, power, output, of, aircraft, engines, originally, meant, to, provide, the, luftwaffe, standard, aircraft, with, superior, high, altitude, performance, technological, considerations, limited, its, use, to, extremely, high, altitudes, accordingly, it, was, only, used, by, specialised, planes, such, as, high, altitude, reconnaissance, aircraft, high, speed, bombers, and, high, altitude, interceptor, aircraft, it, sometimes, could, be, found, on, luftwaffe, aircraft, also, fitted, with, another, engine, boost, system, mw, 50, a, form, of, water, injection, for, aviation, engines, that, used, methanol, for, its, boost, capabilities, one, of, the, major, problems, of, using, nitrous, oxide, in, a, reciprocating, engine, is, that, it, can, produce, enough, power, to, damage, or, destroy, the, engine, very, large, power, increases, are, possible, and, if, the, mechanical, structure, of, the, engine, is, not, properly, reinforced, the, engine, may, be, severely, damaged, or, destroyed, during, this, type, of, operation, it, is, important, with, nitrous, oxide, augmentation, of, petrol, engines, to, maintain, proper, operating, temperatures, and, fuel, levels, to, prevent, pre, ignition, or, detonation, sometimes, referred, to, as, knock, most, problems, that, are, associated, with, nitrous, oxide, do, not, come, from, mechanical, failure, due, to, the, power, increases, since, nitrous, oxide, allows, a, much, denser, charge, into, the, cylinder, it, dramatically, increases, cylinder, pressures, the, increased, pressure, and, temperature, can, cause, problems, such, as, melting, the, pistons, or, valves, it, also, may, crack, or, warp, the, piston, or, cylinder, head, and, cause, pre, ignition, due, to, uneven, heating, automotive, grade, liquid, nitrous, oxide, differs, slightly, from, medical, grade, nitrous, oxide, a, small, amount, of, sulfur, dioxide, so, 2, is, added, to, prevent, substance, abuse, the, gas, is, approved, for, use, as, a, food, additive, e, number, e942, specifically, as, an, aerosol, spray, propellant, its, most, common, uses, in, this, context, are, in, aerosol, whipped, cream, canisters, and, cooking, sprays, the, gas, is, extremely, soluble, in, fatty, compounds, in, aerosol, whipped, cream, it, is, dissolved, in, the, fatty, cream, until, it, leaves, the, can, when, it, becomes, gaseous, and, thus, creates, foam, used, in, this, way, it, produces, whipped, cream, which, is, four, times, the, volume, of, the, liquid, whereas, whipping, air, into, cream, only, produces, twice, the, volume, if, air, were, used, as, a, propellant, oxygen, would, accelerate, rancidification, of, the, butterfat, but, nitrous, oxide, inhibits, such, degradation, carbon, dioxide, cannot, be, used, for, whipped, cream, because, it, is, acidic, in, water, which, would, curdle, the, cream, and, give, it, a, seltzer, like, sparkling, sensation, the, whipped, cream, produced, with, nitrous, oxide, is, unstable, and, will, return, to, a, more, liquid, state, within, half, an, hour, to, one, hour, thus, the, method, is, not, suitable, for, decorating, food, that, will, not, be, served, immediately, in, december, 2016, some, manufacturers, reported, a, shortage, of, aerosol, whipped, creams, in, the, united, states, due, to, an, explosion, at, the, air, liquide, nitrous, oxide, facility, in, florida, in, late, august, with, a, major, facility, offline, the, disruption, caused, a, shortage, resulting, in, the, company, diverting, the, supply, of, nitrous, oxide, to, medical, customers, rather, than, to, food, manufacturing, the, shortage, came, during, the, christmas, and, holiday, season, when, canned, whipped, cream, use, is, normally, at, its, highest, similarly, cooking, spray, which, is, made, from, various, types, of, oils, combined, with, lecithin, an, emulsifier, may, use, nitrous, oxide, as, a, propellant, other, propellants, used, in, cooking, spray, include, food, grade, alcohol, and, propane, nitrous, oxide, has, been, used, in, dentistry, and, surgery, as, an, anaesthetic, and, analgesic, since, 1844, in, the, early, days, the, gas, was, administered, through, simple, inhalers, consisting, of, a, breathing, bag, made, of, rubber, cloth, today, the, gas, is, administered, in, hospitals, by, means, of, an, automated, relative, analgesia, machine, with, an, anaesthetic, vaporiser, and, a, medical, ventilator, that, delivers, a, precisely, dosed, and, breath, actuated, flow, of, nitrous, oxide, mixed, with, oxygen, in, a, 2, 1, ratio, nitrous, oxide, is, a, weak, general, anaesthetic, and, so, is, generally, not, used, alone, in, general, anaesthesia, but, used, as, a, carrier, gas, mixed, with, oxygen, for, more, powerful, general, anaesthetic, drugs, such, as, sevoflurane, or, desflurane, it, has, a, minimum, alveolar, concentration, of, 105, and, a, blood, gas, partition, coefficient, of, 0, 46, the, use, of, nitrous, oxide, in, anaesthesia, can, increase, the, risk, of, postoperative, nausea, and, vomiting, dentists, use, a, simpler, machine, which, only, delivers, an, n, 2, o, o, 2, mixture, for, the, patient, to, inhale, while, conscious, but, must, still, be, a, recognised, purpose, designed, dedicated, relative, analgesic, flowmeter, with, a, minimum, 30, of, oxygen, at, all, times, and, a, maximum, upper, limit, of, 70, nitrous, oxide, the, patient, is, kept, conscious, throughout, the, procedure, and, retains, adequate, mental, faculties, to, respond, to, questions, and, instructions, from, the, dentist, inhalation, of, nitrous, oxide, is, used, frequently, to, relieve, pain, associated, with, childbirth, trauma, oral, surgery, and, acute, coronary, syndrome, including, heart, attacks, its, use, during, labour, has, been, shown, to, be, a, safe, and, effective, aid, for, birthing, women, its, use, for, acute, coronary, syndrome, is, of, unknown, benefit, in, canada, and, the, uk, entonox, and, nitronox, are, used, commonly, by, ambulance, crews, including, unregistered, practitioners, as, rapid, and, highly, effective, analgesic, gas, fifty, per, cent, nitrous, oxide, can, be, considered, for, use, by, trained, non, professional, first, aid, responders, in, prehospital, settings, given, the, relative, ease, and, safety, of, administering, 50, nitrous, oxide, as, an, analgesic, the, rapid, reversibility, of, its, effect, would, also, prevent, it, from, precluding, diagnosis, recreational, inhalation, of, nitrous, oxide, with, the, purpose, of, causing, euphoria, and, or, slight, hallucinations, began, as, a, phenomenon, for, the, british, upper, class, in, 1799, known, as, laughing, gas, parties, starting, in, the, 19th, century, the, widespread, availability, of, the, gas, for, medical, and, culinary, purposes, allowed, for, recreational, use, to, expand, greatly, globally, in, the, uk, as, of, 2014, nitrous, oxide, was, estimated, to, be, used, by, almost, half, a, million, young, people, at, nightspots, festivals, and, parties, widespread, recreational, use, of, the, drug, throughout, the, uk, was, featured, in, the, 2017, vice, documentary, inside, the, laughing, gas, black, market, in, which, journalist, matt, shea, met, with, dealers, of, the, drug, who, stole, it, from, hospitals, a, significant, issue, cited, in, london, s, press, is, the, effect, of, nitrous, oxide, canister, littering, which, is, highly, visible, and, causes, significant, complaints, from, communities, prior, to, 8, november, 2023, nitrous, oxide, was, subject, to, the, psychoactive, substances, act, 2016, in, the, uk, it, was, already, illegal, to, produce, supply, import, or, export, nitrous, oxide, for, recreational, use, however, the, uk, government, updated, the, law, on, 8, november, 2023, to, include, possession, of, nitrous, oxide, by, classifying, it, as, a, class, c, drug, under, the, misuse, of, drugs, act, 1971, while, casual, use, of, nitrous, oxide, is, understood, by, most, recreational, users, to, be, a, route, to, a, safe, high, many, are, unaware, that, excessive, consumption, has, the, potential, to, cause, neurological, harm, which, if, left, untreated, can, result, in, permanent, neurological, damage, in, australia, recreation, use, became, a, public, health, concern, following, a, rise, in, reported, cases, of, neurotoxicity, and, a, rise, in, emergency, room, admissions, and, in, the, state, of, south, australia, legislation, was, passed, in, 2020, to, restrict, canister, sales, nitrous, oxide, is, a, significant, occupational, hazard, for, surgeons, dentists, and, nurses, because, nitrous, oxide, is, minimally, metabolised, in, humans, with, a, rate, of, 0, 004, it, retains, its, potency, when, exhaled, into, the, room, by, the, patient, and, can, pose, an, intoxicating, and, prolonged, exposure, hazard, to, the, clinic, staff, if, the, room, is, poorly, ventilated, where, nitrous, oxide, is, administered, a, continuous, flow, fresh, air, ventilation, system, or, n, 2, o, scavenger, system, is, used, to, prevent, a, waste, gas, buildup, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, recommends, that, workers, exposure, to, nitrous, oxide, should, be, controlled, during, the, administration, of, anaesthetic, gas, in, medical, dental, and, veterinary, operators, it, set, a, recommended, exposure, limit, rel, of, 25, ppm, 46, mg, m, 3, to, escaped, anaesthetic, exposure, to, nitrous, oxide, causes, short, term, decreases, in, mental, performance, audiovisual, ability, and, manual, dexterity, these, effects, coupled, with, the, induced, spatial, and, temporal, disorientation, could, result, in, physical, harm, to, the, user, from, environmental, hazards, nitrous, oxide, is, neurotoxic, and, there, is, evidence, that, medium, or, long, term, habitual, consumption, of, significant, quantities, can, cause, neurological, harm, with, the, potential, for, permanent, damage, if, left, untreated, like, other, nmda, receptor, antagonists, it, has, been, suggested, that, n, 2, o, produces, neurotoxicity, in, the, form, of, olney, s, lesions, in, rodents, upon, prolonged, several, hour, exposure, it, has, been, argued, that, because, n, 2, o, is, rapidly, expelled, from, the, body, under, normal, circumstances, it, is, less, likely, to, be, neurotoxic, than, other, nmdar, antagonists, indeed, in, rodents, short, term, exposure, results, in, only, mild, injury, that, is, rapidly, reversible, and, neuronal, death, occurs, only, after, constant, and, sustained, exposure, nitrous, oxide, also, may, cause, neurotoxicity, after, extended, exposure, because, of, hypoxia, this, is, especially, true, of, non, medical, formulations, such, as, whipped, cream, chargers, also, known, as, whippets, or, nangs, which, never, contain, oxygen, since, oxygen, makes, cream, rancid, in, heavy, 400, g, or, 200, l, of, n, 2, o, gas, in, one, session, or, frequent, regular, i, e, daily, or, weekly, users, reported, to, poison, control, centers, signs, of, peripheral, neuropathy, have, been, noted, the, presence, of, ataxia, gait, abnormalities, or, paresthesia, perception, of, abnormal, sensations, e, g, tingling, numbness, prickling, mostly, in, the, extremities, these, are, considered, an, early, sign, of, neurological, damage, and, indicates, chronic, toxicity, nitrous, oxide, at, 75, by, volume, reduces, ischemia, induced, neuronal, death, induced, by, occlusion, of, the, middle, cerebral, artery, in, rodents, and, decreases, nmda, induced, ca, 2, influx, in, neuronal, cell, cultures, a, critical, event, involved, in, excitotoxicity, occupational, exposure, to, ambient, nitrous, oxide, has, been, associated, with, dna, damage, due, to, interruptions, in, dna, synthesis, this, correlation, is, dose, dependent, and, does, not, appear, to, extend, to, casual, recreational, use, however, further, research, is, needed, to, confirm, the, duration, and, quantity, of, exposure, needed, to, cause, damage, if, pure, nitrous, oxide, is, inhaled, without, oxygen, oxygen, deprivation, can, occur, resulting, in, low, blood, pressure, fainting, and, even, heart, attacks, this, can, occur, if, the, user, inhales, large, quantities, continuously, as, with, a, strap, on, mask, connected, to, a, gas, canister, it, can, also, happen, if, the, user, engages, in, excessive, breath, holding, or, uses, any, other, inhalation, system, that, cuts, off, a, supply, of, fresh, air, long, term, exposure, to, nitrous, oxide, may, cause, vitamin, b, 12, deficiency, this, can, cause, serious, neurotoxicity, if, the, user, has, preexisting, vitamin, b, 12, deficiency, it, inactivates, the, cobalamin, form, of, vitamin, b, 12, by, oxidation, symptoms, of, vitamin, b, 12, deficiency, including, sensory, neuropathy, myelopathy, and, encephalopathy, may, occur, within, days, or, weeks, of, exposure, to, nitrous, oxide, anaesthesia, in, people, with, subclinical, vitamin, b, 12, deficiency, symptoms, are, treated, with, high, doses, of, vitamin, b, 12, but, recovery, can, be, slow, and, incomplete, people, with, normal, vitamin, b, 12, levels, have, stores, to, make, the, effects, of, nitrous, oxide, insignificant, unless, exposure, is, repeated, and, prolonged, nitrous, oxide, abuse, vitamin, b, 12, levels, should, be, checked, in, people, with, risk, factors, for, vitamin, b, 12, deficiency, prior, to, using, nitrous, oxide, anaesthesia, several, experimental, studies, in, rats, indicate, that, chronic, exposure, of, pregnant, females, to, nitrous, oxide, may, have, adverse, effects, on, the, developing, fetus, at, room, temperature, 20, c, the, saturated, vapour, pressure, is, 50, 525, bar, rising, up, to, 72, 45, bar, at, 36, 4, c, 97, 5, f, the, critical, temperature, the, pressure, curve, is, thus, unusually, sensitive, to, temperature, as, with, many, strong, oxidisers, contamination, of, parts, with, fuels, have, been, implicated, in, rocketry, accidents, where, small, quantities, of, nitrous, fuel, mixtures, explode, due, to, water, hammer, like, effects, sometimes, called, dieseling, heating, due, to, adiabatic, compression, of, gases, can, reach, decomposition, temperatures, some, common, building, materials, such, as, stainless, steel, and, aluminium, can, act, as, fuels, with, strong, oxidisers, such, as, nitrous, oxide, as, can, contaminants, that, may, ignite, due, to, adiabatic, compression, there, also, have, been, incidents, where, nitrous, oxide, decomposition, in, plumbing, has, led, to, the, explosion, of, large, tanks, the, pharmacological, mechanism, of, action, of, n, 2, o, in, medicine, is, not, fully, known, however, it, has, been, shown, to, directly, modulate, a, broad, range, of, ligand, gated, ion, channels, and, this, likely, plays, a, major, role, in, many, of, its, effects, it, moderately, blocks, nmdar, and, 2, subunit, containing, nach, channels, weakly, inhibits, ampa, kainate, gaba, c, and, 5, ht, 3, receptors, and, slightly, potentiates, gaba, a, and, glycine, receptors, it, also, has, been, shown, to, activate, two, pore, domain, k, channels, while, n, 2, o, affects, quite, a, few, ion, channels, its, anaesthetic, hallucinogenic, and, euphoriant, effects, are, likely, caused, predominantly, or, fully, via, inhibition, of, nmda, receptor, mediated, currents, in, addition, to, its, effects, on, ion, channels, n, 2, o, may, act, to, imitate, nitric, oxide, no, in, the, central, nervous, system, and, this, may, be, related, to, its, analgesic, and, anxiolytic, properties, nitrous, oxide, is, 30, to, 40, times, more, soluble, than, nitrogen, the, effects, of, inhaling, sub, anaesthetic, doses, of, nitrous, oxide, have, been, known, to, vary, based, on, several, factors, including, settings, and, individual, differences, however, from, his, discussion, jay, 2008, suggests, that, it, has, been, reliably, known, to, induce, the, following, states, and, sensations, a, minority, of, users, also, will, present, with, uncontrolled, vocalisations, and, muscular, spasms, these, effects, generally, disappear, minutes, after, removal, of, the, nitrous, oxide, source, in, behavioural, tests, of, anxiety, a, low, dose, of, n, 2, o, is, an, effective, anxiolytic, and, this, anti, anxiety, effect, is, associated, with, enhanced, activity, of, gaba, a, receptors, as, it, is, partially, reversed, by, benzodiazepine, receptor, antagonists, mirroring, this, animals, that, have, developed, tolerance, to, the, anxiolytic, effects, of, benzodiazepines, are, partially, tolerant, to, n, 2, o, indeed, in, humans, given, 30, n, 2, o, benzodiazepine, receptor, antagonists, reduced, the, subjective, reports, of, feeling, high, but, did, not, alter, psychomotor, performance, in, human, clinical, studies, the, analgesic, effects, of, n, 2, o, are, linked, to, the, interaction, between, the, endogenous, opioid, system, and, the, descending, noradrenergic, system, when, animals, are, given, morphine, chronically, they, develop, tolerance, to, its, pain, killing, effects, and, this, also, renders, the, animals, tolerant, to, the, analgesic, effects, of, n, 2, o, administration, of, antibodies, that, bind, and, block, the, activity, of, some, endogenous, opioids, not, endorphin, also, block, the, antinociceptive, effects, of, n, 2, o, drugs, that, inhibit, the, breakdown, of, endogenous, opioids, also, potentiate, the, antinociceptive, effects, of, n, 2, o, several, experiments, have, shown, that, opioid, receptor, antagonists, applied, directly, to, the, brain, block, the, antinociceptive, effects, of, n, 2, o, but, these, drugs, have, no, effect, when, injected, into, the, spinal, cord, apart, from, an, indirect, action, nitrous, oxide, like, morphine, also, interacts, directly, with, the, endogenous, opioid, system, by, binding, at, opioid, receptor, binding, sites, conversely, 2, adrenoceptor, antagonists, block, the, pain, reducing, effects, of, n, 2, o, when, given, directly, to, the, spinal, cord, but, not, when, applied, directly, to, the, brain, indeed, 2b, adrenoceptor, knockout, mice, or, animals, depleted, in, norepinephrine, are, nearly, completely, resistant, to, the, antinociceptive, effects, of, n, 2, o, apparently, n, 2, o, induced, release, of, endogenous, opioids, causes, disinhibition, of, brainstem, noradrenergic, neurons, which, release, norepinephrine, into, the, spinal, cord, and, inhibit, pain, signalling, exactly, how, n, 2, o, causes, the, release, of, endogenous, opioid, peptides, remains, uncertain, nitrous, oxide, is, a, colourless, gas, with, a, faint, sweet, odour, nitrous, oxide, supports, combustion, by, releasing, the, dipolar, bonded, oxygen, radical, and, can, thus, relight, a, glowing, splint, n, 2, o, is, inert, at, room, temperature, and, has, few, reactions, at, elevated, temperatures, its, reactivity, increases, for, example, nitrous, oxide, reacts, with, nanh, 2, at, 187, c, 369, f, to, give, nan, 3, the, above, reaction, is, the, route, adopted, by, the, commercial, chemical, industry, to, produce, azide, salts, which, are, used, as, detonators, the, gas, was, first, synthesised, in, 1772, by, english, natural, philosopher, and, chemist, joseph, priestley, who, called, it, dephlogisticated, nitrous, air, see, phlogiston, theory, or, inflammable, nitrous, air, priestley, published, his, discovery, in, the, book, experiments, and, observations, on, different, kinds, of, air, 1775, where, he, described, how, to, produce, the, preparation, of, nitrous, air, diminished, by, heating, iron, filings, dampened, with, nitric, acid, the, first, important, use, of, nitrous, oxide, was, made, possible, by, thomas, beddoes, and, james, watt, who, worked, together, to, publish, the, book, considerations, on, the, medical, use, and, on, the, production, of, factitious, airs, 1794, this, book, was, important, for, two, reasons, first, james, watt, had, invented, a, novel, machine, to, produce, factitious, airs, including, nitrous, oxide, and, a, novel, breathing, apparatus, to, inhale, the, gas, second, the, book, also, presented, the, new, medical, theories, by, thomas, beddoes, that, tuberculosis, and, other, lung, diseases, could, be, treated, by, inhalation, of, factitious, airs, the, machine, to, produce, factitious, airs, had, three, parts, a, furnace, to, burn, the, needed, material, a, vessel, with, water, where, the, produced, gas, passed, through, in, a, spiral, pipe, for, impurities, to, be, washed, off, and, finally, the, gas, cylinder, with, a, gasometer, where, the, gas, produced, air, could, be, tapped, into, portable, air, bags, made, of, airtight, oily, silk, the, breathing, apparatus, consisted, of, one, of, the, portable, air, bags, connected, with, a, tube, to, a, mouthpiece, with, this, new, equipment, being, engineered, and, produced, by, 1794, the, way, was, paved, for, clinical, trials, which, began, in, 1798, when, thomas, beddoes, established, the, pneumatic, institution, for, relieving, diseases, by, medical, airs, in, hotwells, bristol, in, the, basement, of, the, building, a, large, scale, machine, was, producing, the, gases, under, the, supervision, of, a, young, humphry, davy, who, was, encouraged, to, experiment, with, new, gases, for, patients, to, inhale, the, first, important, work, of, davy, was, examination, of, the, nitrous, oxide, and, the, publication, of, his, results, in, the, book, researches, chemical, and, philosophical, 1800, in, that, publication, davy, notes, the, analgesic, effect, of, nitrous, oxide, at, page, 465, and, its, potential, to, be, used, for, surgical, operations, at, page, 556, davy, coined, the, name, laughing, gas, for, nitrous, oxide, despite, davy, s, discovery, that, inhalation, of, nitrous, oxide, could, relieve, a, conscious, person, from, pain, another, 44, years, elapsed, before, doctors, attempted, to, use, it, for, anaesthesia, the, use, of, nitrous, oxide, as, a, recreational, drug, at, laughing, gas, parties, primarily, arranged, for, the, british, upper, class, became, an, immediate, success, beginning, in, 1799, while, the, effects, of, the, gas, generally, make, the, user, appear, stuporous, dreamy, and, sedated, some, people, also, get, the, giggles, in, a, state, of, euphoria, and, frequently, erupt, in, laughter, one, of, the, earliest, commercial, producers, in, the, u, s, was, george, poe, cousin, of, the, poet, edgar, allan, poe, who, also, was, the, first, to, liquefy, the, gas, the, first, time, nitrous, oxide, was, used, as, an, anaesthetic, drug, in, the, treatment, of, a, patient, was, when, dentist, horace, wells, with, assistance, by, gardner, quincy, colton, and, john, mankey, riggs, demonstrated, insensitivity, to, pain, from, a, dental, extraction, on, 11, december, 1844, in, the, following, weeks, wells, treated, the, first, 12, to, 15, patients, with, nitrous, oxide, in, hartford, connecticut, and, according, to, his, own, record, only, failed, in, two, cases, in, spite, of, these, convincing, results, having, been, reported, by, wells, to, the, medical, society, in, boston, in, december, 1844, this, new, method, was, not, immediately, adopted, by, other, dentists, the, reason, for, this, was, most, likely, that, wells, in, january, 1845, at, his, first, public, demonstration, to, the, medical, faculty, in, boston, had, been, partly, unsuccessful, leaving, his, colleagues, doubtful, regarding, its, efficacy, and, safety, the, method, did, not, come, into, general, use, until, 1863, when, gardner, quincy, colton, successfully, started, to, use, it, in, all, his, colton, dental, association, clinics, that, he, had, just, established, in, new, haven, and, new, york, city, over, the, following, three, years, colton, and, his, associates, successfully, administered, nitrous, oxide, to, more, than, 25, 000, patients, today, nitrous, oxide, is, used, in, dentistry, as, an, anxiolytic, as, an, adjunct, to, local, anaesthetic, nitrous, oxide, was, not, found, to, be, a, strong, enough, anaesthetic, for, use, in, major, surgery, in, hospital, settings, however, instead, diethyl, ether, being, a, stronger, and, more, potent, anaesthetic, was, demonstrated, and, accepted, for, use, in, october, 1846, along, with, chloroform, in, 1847, when, joseph, thomas, clover, invented, the, gas, ether, inhaler, in, 1876, however, it, became, a, common, practice, at, hospitals, to, initiate, all, anaesthetic, treatments, with, a, mild, flow, of, nitrous, oxide, and, then, gradually, increase, the, anaesthesia, with, the, stronger, ether, or, chloroform, clover, s, gas, ether, inhaler, was, designed, to, supply, the, patient, with, nitrous, oxide, and, ether, at, the, same, time, with, the, exact, mixture, being, controlled, by, the, operator, of, the, device, it, remained, in, use, by, many, hospitals, until, the, 1930s, although, hospitals, today, use, a, more, advanced, anaesthetic, machine, these, machines, still, use, the, same, principle, launched, with, clover, s, gas, ether, inhaler, to, initiate, the, anaesthesia, with, nitrous, oxide, before, the, administration, of, a, more, powerful, anaesthetic, colton, s, popularisation, of, nitrous, oxide, led, to, its, adoption, by, a, number, of, less, than, reputable, quacksalvers, who, touted, it, as, a, cure, for, consumption, scrofula, catarrh, and, other, diseases, of, the, blood, throat, and, lungs, nitrous, oxide, treatment, was, administered, and, licensed, as, a, patent, medicine, by, the, likes, of, c, l, blood, and, jerome, harris, in, boston, and, charles, e, barney, of, chicago, reviewing, various, methods, of, producing, nitrous, oxide, is, published, nitrous, oxide, is, prepared, on, an, industrial, scale, by, carefully, heating, ammonium, nitrate, at, about, 250, c, which, decomposes, into, nitrous, oxide, and, water, vapour, the, addition, of, various, phosphate, salts, favours, formation, of, a, purer, gas, at, slightly, lower, temperatures, this, reaction, may, be, difficult, to, control, resulting, in, detonation, the, decomposition, of, ammonium, nitrate, is, also, a, common, laboratory, method, for, preparing, the, gas, equivalently, it, can, be, obtained, by, heating, a, mixture, of, sodium, nitrate, and, ammonium, sulfate, another, method, involves, the, reaction, of, urea, nitric, acid, and, sulfuric, acid, direct, oxidation, of, ammonia, with, a, manganese, dioxide, bismuth, oxide, catalyst, has, been, reported, cf, ostwald, process, hydroxylammonium, chloride, reacts, with, sodium, nitrite, to, give, nitrous, oxide, if, the, nitrite, is, added, to, the, hydroxylamine, solution, the, only, remaining, by, product, is, salt, water, if, the, hydroxylamine, solution, is, added, to, the, nitrite, solution, nitrite, is, in, excess, however, then, toxic, higher, oxides, of, nitrogen, also, are, formed, treating, hno, 3, with, sncl, 2, and, hcl, also, has, been, demonstrated, hyponitrous, acid, decomposes, to, n, 2, o, and, water, with, a, half, life, of, 16, days, at, 25, c, at, ph, 1, 3, nitrous, oxide, is, a, minor, component, of, earth, s, atmosphere, and, is, an, active, part, of, the, planetary, nitrogen, cycle, based, on, analysis, of, air, samples, gathered, from, sites, around, the, world, its, concentration, surpassed, 330, ppb, in, 2017, the, growth, rate, of, about, 1, ppb, per, year, has, also, accelerated, during, recent, decades, nitrous, oxide, s, atmospheric, abundance, has, grown, more, than, 20, from, a, base, level, of, about, 270, ppb, in, year, 1750, important, atmospheric, properties, of, n, 2, o, are, summarized, in, the, following, table, in, 2022, the, ipcc, reported, that, the, human, perturbation, of, the, natural, nitrogen, cycle, through, the, use, of, synthetic, fertilizers, and, manure, as, well, as, nitrogen, deposition, resulting, from, land, based, agriculture, and, fossil, fuel, burning, has, been, the, largest, driver, of, the, increase, in, atmospheric, n2o, of, 31, 0, 0, 5, ppb, 10, between, 1980, and, 2019, 17, 0, 12, 2, to, 23, 5, million, tonnes, total, annual, average, nitrogen, in, n, 2, o, was, emitted, in, 2007, 2016, about, 40, of, n, 2, o, emissions, are, from, humans, and, the, rest, are, part, of, the, natural, nitrogen, cycle, the, n, 2, o, emitted, each, year, by, humans, has, a, greenhouse, effect, equivalent, to, about, 3, billion, tonnes, of, carbon, dioxide, for, comparison, humans, emitted, 37, billion, tonnes, of, actual, carbon, dioxide, in, 2019, and, methane, equivalent, to, 9, billion, tonnes, of, carbon, dioxide, most, of, the, n, 2, o, emitted, into, the, atmosphere, from, natural, and, anthropogenic, sources, is, produced, by, microorganisms, such, as, denitrifying, bacteria, and, fungi, in, soils, and, oceans, soils, under, natural, vegetation, are, an, important, source, of, nitrous, oxide, accounting, for, 60, of, all, naturally, produced, emissions, other, natural, sources, include, the, oceans, 35, and, atmospheric, chemical, reactions, 5, wetlands, can, also, be, emitters, of, nitrous, oxide, emissions, from, thawing, permafrost, may, be, significant, but, as, of, 2022, this, is, not, certain, the, main, components, of, anthropogenic, emissions, are, fertilised, agricultural, soils, and, livestock, manure, 42, runoff, and, leaching, of, fertilisers, 25, biomass, burning, 10, fossil, fuel, combustion, and, industrial, processes, 10, biological, degradation, of, other, nitrogen, containing, atmospheric, emissions, 9, and, human, sewage, 5, agriculture, enhances, nitrous, oxide, production, through, soil, cultivation, the, use, of, nitrogen, fertilisers, and, animal, waste, handling, these, activities, stimulate, naturally, occurring, bacteria, to, produce, more, nitrous, oxide, nitrous, oxide, emissions, from, soil, can, be, challenging, to, measure, as, they, vary, markedly, over, time, and, space, and, the, majority, of, a, year, s, emissions, may, occur, when, conditions, are, favorable, during, hot, moments, and, or, at, favorable, locations, known, as, hotspots, among, industrial, emissions, the, production, of, nitric, acid, and, adipic, acid, are, the, largest, sources, of, nitrous, oxide, emissions, the, adipic, acid, emissions, specifically, arise, from, the, degradation, of, the, nitrolic, acid, intermediate, derived, from, the, nitration, of, cyclohexanone, natural, processes, that, generate, nitrous, oxide, may, be, classified, as, nitrification, and, denitrification, specifically, they, include, these, processes, are, affected, by, soil, chemical, and, physical, properties, such, as, the, availability, of, mineral, nitrogen, and, organic, matter, acidity, and, soil, type, as, well, as, climate, related, factors, such, as, soil, temperature, and, water, content, the, emission, of, the, gas, to, the, atmosphere, is, limited, greatly, by, its, consumption, inside, the, cells, by, a, process, catalysed, by, the, enzyme, nitrous, oxide, reductase, global, accounting, of, n, 2, o, sources, and, sinks, over, the, decade, ending, 2016, indicates, that, about, 40, of, the, average, 17, tgn, yr, teragrams, or, million, metric, tons, of, nitrogen, per, year, of, emissions, originated, from, human, activity, and, shows, that, emissions, growth, chiefly, came, from, expanding, agriculture, nitrous, oxide, has, significant, global, warming, potential, as, a, greenhouse, gas, on, a, per, molecule, basis, considered, over, a, 100, year, period, nitrous, oxide, has, 265, times, the, atmospheric, heat, trapping, ability, of, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, however, because, of, its, low, concentration, less, than, 1, 1, 000, of, that, of, co, 2, its, contribution, to, the, greenhouse, effect, is, less, than, one, third, that, of, carbon, dioxide, and, also, less, than, methane, on, the, other, hand, since, about, 40, of, the, n, 2, o, entering, the, atmosphere, is, the, result, of, human, activity, control, of, nitrous, oxide, is, part, of, efforts, to, curb, greenhouse, gas, emissions, most, human, caused, nitrous, oxide, released, into, the, atmosphere, is, a, greenhouse, gas, emission, from, agriculture, when, farmers, add, nitrogen, based, fertilizers, onto, the, fields, and, through, the, breakdown, of, animal, manure, reduction, of, emissions, can, be, a, hot, topic, in, the, politics, of, climate, change, nitrous, oxide, is, also, released, as, a, by, product, of, burning, fossil, fuel, though, the, amount, released, depends, on, which, fuel, was, used, it, is, also, emitted, through, the, manufacture, of, nitric, acid, which, is, used, in, the, synthesis, of, nitrogen, fertilizers, the, production, of, adipic, acid, a, precursor, to, nylon, and, other, synthetic, clothing, fibres, also, releases, nitrous, oxide, a, rise, in, atmospheric, nitrous, oxide, concentrations, has, been, implicated, as, a, possible, contributor, to, the, extremely, intense, global, warming, during, the, cenomanian, turonian, boundary, event, nitrous, oxide, has, also, been, implicated, in, thinning, the, ozone, layer, a, 2009, study, suggested, that, n, 2, o, emission, was, the, single, most, important, ozone, depleting, emission, and, it, was, expected, to, remain, the, largest, throughout, the, 21st, century, transfer, of, nitrous, oxide, from, bulk, cylinders, to, smaller, more, transportable, e, type, 1, 590, litre, capacity, tanks, is, legal, when, the, intended, use, of, the, gas, is, for, medical, anaesthesia, the, ministry, of, health, has, warned, that, nitrous, oxide, is, a, prescription, medicine, and, its, sale, or, possession, without, a, prescription, is, an, offense, under, the, medicines, act, this, statement, would, seemingly, prohibit, all, non, medicinal, uses, of, nitrous, oxide, although, it, is, implied, that, only, recreational, use, will, be, targeted, legally, in, august, 2015, the, council, of, the, london, borough, of, lambeth, uk, banned, the, use, of, the, drug, for, recreational, purposes, making, offenders, liable, to, an, on, the, spot, fine, of, up, to, 1, 000, in, september, 2023, the, government, announced, that, nitrous, oxide, would, be, made, illegal, by, the, end, of, the, year, with, possession, potentially, carrying, up, to, a, two, year, prison, sentence, or, an, unlimited, fine, possession, of, nitrous, oxide, is, legal, under, federal, law, and, is, not, subject, to, dea, purview, it, is, however, regulated, by, the, food, and, drug, administration, under, the, food, drug, and, cosmetics, act, prosecution, is, possible, under, its, misbranding, clauses, prohibiting, the, sale, or, distribution, of, nitrous, oxide, for, the, purpose, of, human, consumption, many, states, have, laws, regulating, the, possession, sale, and, distribution, of, nitrous, oxide, such, laws, usually, ban, distribution, to, minors, or, limit, the, amount, of, nitrous, oxide, that, may, be, sold, without, special, license, for, example, in, the, state, of, california, possession, for, recreational, use, is, prohibited, and, qualifies, as, a, misdemeanor
