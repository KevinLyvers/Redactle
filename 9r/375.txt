zinc, is, a, chemical, element, with, the, symbol, zn, and, atomic, number, 30, it, is, a, slightly, brittle, metal, at, room, temperature, and, has, a, shiny, greyish, appearance, when, oxidation, is, removed, it, is, the, first, element, in, group, 12, iib, of, the, periodic, table, in, some, respects, zinc, is, chemically, similar, to, magnesium, both, elements, exhibit, only, one, normal, oxidation, state, 2, and, the, zn, 2, and, mg, 2, ions, are, of, similar, size, zinc, is, the, 24th, most, abundant, element, in, earth, s, crust, and, has, five, stable, isotopes, the, most, common, zinc, ore, is, sphalerite, zinc, blende, a, zinc, sulfide, mineral, the, largest, workable, lodes, are, in, australia, asia, and, the, united, states, zinc, is, refined, by, froth, flotation, of, the, ore, roasting, and, final, extraction, using, electricity, electrowinning, zinc, is, an, essential, trace, element, for, humans, animals, plants, and, for, microorganisms, and, is, necessary, for, prenatal, and, postnatal, development, it, is, the, second, most, abundant, trace, metal, in, humans, after, iron, and, it, is, the, only, metal, which, appears, in, all, enzyme, classes, zinc, is, also, an, essential, nutrient, element, for, coral, growth, as, it, is, an, important, cofactor, for, many, enzymes, zinc, deficiency, affects, about, two, billion, people, in, the, developing, world, and, is, associated, with, many, diseases, in, children, deficiency, causes, growth, retardation, delayed, sexual, maturation, infection, susceptibility, and, diarrhea, enzymes, with, a, zinc, atom, in, the, reactive, center, are, widespread, in, biochemistry, such, as, alcohol, dehydrogenase, in, humans, consumption, of, excess, zinc, may, cause, ataxia, lethargy, and, copper, deficiency, in, marine, biomes, notably, within, polar, regions, a, deficit, of, zinc, can, compromise, the, vitality, of, primary, algal, communities, potentially, destabilizing, the, intricate, marine, trophic, structures, and, consequently, impacting, biodiversity, brass, an, alloy, of, copper, and, zinc, in, various, proportions, was, used, as, early, as, the, third, millennium, bc, in, the, aegean, area, and, the, region, which, currently, includes, iraq, the, united, arab, emirates, kalmykia, turkmenistan, and, georgia, in, the, second, millennium, bc, it, was, used, in, the, regions, currently, including, west, india, uzbekistan, iran, syria, iraq, and, israel, zinc, metal, was, not, produced, on, a, large, scale, until, the, 12th, century, in, india, though, it, was, known, to, the, ancient, romans, and, greeks, the, mines, of, rajasthan, have, given, definite, evidence, of, zinc, production, going, back, to, the, 6th, century, bc, the, oldest, evidence, of, pure, zinc, comes, from, zawar, in, rajasthan, as, early, as, the, 9th, century, ad, when, a, distillation, process, was, employed, to, make, pure, zinc, alchemists, burned, zinc, in, air, to, form, what, they, called, philosopher, s, wool, or, white, snow, the, element, was, probably, named, by, the, alchemist, paracelsus, after, the, german, word, zinke, prong, tooth, german, chemist, andreas, sigismund, marggraf, is, credited, with, discovering, pure, metallic, zinc, in, 1746, work, by, luigi, galvani, and, alessandro, volta, uncovered, the, electrochemical, properties, of, zinc, by, 1800, corrosion, resistant, zinc, plating, of, iron, hot, dip, galvanizing, is, the, major, application, for, zinc, other, applications, are, in, electrical, batteries, small, non, structural, castings, and, alloys, such, as, brass, a, variety, of, zinc, compounds, are, commonly, used, such, as, zinc, carbonate, and, zinc, gluconate, as, dietary, supplements, zinc, chloride, in, deodorants, zinc, pyrithione, anti, dandruff, shampoos, zinc, sulfide, in, luminescent, paints, and, dimethylzinc, or, diethylzinc, in, the, organic, laboratory, zinc, is, a, bluish, white, lustrous, diamagnetic, metal, though, most, common, commercial, grades, of, the, metal, have, a, dull, finish, it, is, somewhat, less, dense, than, iron, and, has, a, hexagonal, crystal, structure, with, a, distorted, form, of, hexagonal, close, packing, in, which, each, atom, has, six, nearest, neighbors, at, 265, 9, pm, in, its, own, plane, and, six, others, at, a, greater, distance, of, 290, 6, pm, the, metal, is, hard, and, brittle, at, most, temperatures, but, becomes, malleable, between, 100, and, 150, c, above, 210, c, the, metal, becomes, brittle, again, and, can, be, pulverized, by, beating, zinc, is, a, fair, conductor, of, electricity, for, a, metal, zinc, has, relatively, low, melting, 419, 5, c, and, boiling, point, 907, c, the, melting, point, is, the, lowest, of, all, the, d, block, metals, aside, from, mercury, and, cadmium, for, this, reason, among, others, zinc, cadmium, and, mercury, are, often, not, considered, to, be, transition, metals, like, the, rest, of, the, d, block, metals, many, alloys, contain, zinc, including, brass, other, metals, long, known, to, form, binary, alloys, with, zinc, are, aluminium, antimony, bismuth, gold, iron, lead, mercury, silver, tin, magnesium, cobalt, nickel, tellurium, and, sodium, although, neither, zinc, nor, zirconium, is, ferromagnetic, their, alloy, zrzn, 2, exhibits, ferromagnetism, below, 35, k, zinc, makes, up, about, 75, ppm, 0, 0075, of, earth, s, crust, making, it, the, 24th, most, abundant, element, it, also, makes, up, 312, ppm, of, the, solar, system, where, it, is, the, 22nd, most, abundant, element, typical, background, concentrations, of, zinc, do, not, exceed, 1, g, m, 3, in, the, atmosphere, 300, mg, kg, in, soil, 100, mg, kg, in, vegetation, 20, g, l, in, freshwater, and, 5, g, l, in, seawater, the, element, is, normally, found, in, association, with, other, base, metals, such, as, copper, and, lead, in, ores, zinc, is, a, chalcophile, meaning, the, element, is, more, likely, to, be, found, in, minerals, together, with, sulfur, and, other, heavy, chalcogens, rather, than, with, the, light, chalcogen, oxygen, or, with, non, chalcogen, electronegative, elements, such, as, the, halogens, sulfides, formed, as, the, crust, solidified, under, the, reducing, conditions, of, the, early, earth, s, atmosphere, sphalerite, which, is, a, form, of, zinc, sulfide, is, the, most, heavily, mined, zinc, containing, ore, because, its, concentrate, contains, 60, 62, zinc, other, source, minerals, for, zinc, include, smithsonite, zinc, carbonate, hemimorphite, zinc, silicate, wurtzite, another, zinc, sulfide, and, sometimes, hydrozincite, basic, zinc, carbonate, with, the, exception, of, wurtzite, all, these, other, minerals, were, formed, by, weathering, of, the, primordial, zinc, sulfides, identified, world, zinc, resources, total, about, 1, 9, 2, 8, billion, tonnes, large, deposits, are, in, australia, canada, and, the, united, states, with, the, largest, reserves, in, iran, the, most, recent, estimate, of, reserve, base, for, zinc, meets, specified, minimum, physical, criteria, related, to, current, mining, and, production, practices, was, made, in, 2009, and, calculated, to, be, roughly, 480, mt, zinc, reserves, on, the, other, hand, are, geologically, identified, ore, bodies, whose, suitability, for, recovery, is, economically, based, location, grade, quality, and, quantity, at, the, time, of, determination, since, exploration, and, mine, development, is, an, ongoing, process, the, amount, of, zinc, reserves, is, not, a, fixed, number, and, sustainability, of, zinc, ore, supplies, cannot, be, judged, by, simply, extrapolating, the, combined, mine, life, of, today, s, zinc, mines, this, concept, is, well, supported, by, data, from, the, united, states, geological, survey, usgs, which, illustrates, that, although, refined, zinc, production, increased, 80, between, 1990, and, 2010, the, reserve, lifetime, for, zinc, has, remained, unchanged, about, 346, million, tonnes, have, been, extracted, throughout, history, to, 2002, and, scholars, have, estimated, that, about, 109, 305, million, tonnes, are, in, use, five, stable, isotopes, of, zinc, occur, in, nature, with, 64, zn, being, the, most, abundant, isotope, 49, 17, natural, abundance, the, other, isotopes, found, in, nature, are, 66, zn, 27, 73, 67, zn, 4, 04, 68, zn, 18, 45, and, 70, zn, 0, 61, several, dozen, radioisotopes, have, been, characterized, 65, zn, which, has, a, half, life, of, 243, 66, days, is, the, least, active, radioisotope, followed, by, 72, zn, with, a, half, life, of, 46, 5, hours, zinc, has, 10, nuclear, isomers, of, which, 69m, zn, has, the, longest, half, life, 13, 76, h, the, superscript, m, indicates, a, metastable, isotope, the, nucleus, of, a, metastable, isotope, is, in, an, excited, state, and, will, return, to, the, ground, state, by, emitting, a, photon, in, the, form, of, a, gamma, ray, 61, zn, has, three, excited, metastable, states, and, 73, zn, has, two, the, isotopes, 65, zn, 71, zn, 77, zn, and, 78, zn, each, have, only, one, excited, metastable, state, the, most, common, decay, mode, of, a, radioisotope, of, zinc, with, a, mass, number, lower, than, 66, is, electron, capture, the, decay, product, resulting, from, electron, capture, is, an, isotope, of, copper, the, most, common, decay, mode, of, a, radioisotope, of, zinc, with, mass, number, higher, than, 66, is, beta, decay, which, produces, an, isotope, of, gallium, zinc, has, an, electron, configuration, of, 3d, 10, 4s, 2, and, is, a, member, of, the, group, 12, of, the, periodic, table, it, is, a, moderately, reactive, metal, and, strong, reducing, agent, the, surface, of, the, pure, metal, tarnishes, quickly, eventually, forming, a, protective, passivating, layer, of, the, basic, zinc, carbonate, zn, 5, oh, 6, co, 3, 2, by, reaction, with, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, zinc, burns, in, air, with, a, bright, bluish, green, flame, giving, off, fumes, of, zinc, oxide, zinc, reacts, readily, with, acids, alkalis, and, other, non, metals, extremely, pure, zinc, reacts, only, slowly, at, room, temperature, with, acids, strong, acids, such, as, hydrochloric, or, sulfuric, acid, can, remove, the, passivating, layer, and, the, subsequent, reaction, with, the, acid, releases, hydrogen, gas, the, chemistry, of, zinc, is, dominated, by, the, 2, oxidation, state, when, compounds, in, this, oxidation, state, are, formed, the, outer, shell, s, electrons, are, lost, yielding, a, bare, zinc, ion, with, the, electronic, configuration, 3d, 10, in, aqueous, solution, an, octahedral, complex, 2, is, the, predominant, species, the, volatilization, of, zinc, in, combination, with, zinc, chloride, at, temperatures, above, 285, c, indicates, the, formation, of, zn, 2, cl, 2, a, zinc, compound, with, a, 1, oxidation, state, no, compounds, of, zinc, in, positive, oxidation, states, other, than, 1, or, 2, are, known, calculations, indicate, that, a, zinc, compound, with, the, oxidation, state, of, 4, is, unlikely, to, exist, zn, iii, is, predicted, to, exist, in, the, presence, of, strongly, electronegative, trianions, however, there, exists, some, doubt, around, this, possibility, but, in, 2021, another, compound, was, reported, with, more, evidence, that, had, the, oxidation, state, of, 3, with, the, formula, znbeb, 11, cn, 12, zinc, chemistry, is, similar, to, the, chemistry, of, the, late, first, row, transition, metals, nickel, and, copper, though, it, has, a, filled, d, shell, and, compounds, are, diamagnetic, and, mostly, colorless, the, ionic, radii, of, zinc, and, magnesium, happen, to, be, nearly, identical, because, of, this, some, of, the, equivalent, salts, have, the, same, crystal, structure, and, in, other, circumstances, where, ionic, radius, is, a, determining, factor, the, chemistry, of, zinc, has, much, in, common, with, that, of, magnesium, in, other, respects, there, is, little, similarity, with, the, late, first, row, transition, metals, zinc, tends, to, form, bonds, with, a, greater, degree, of, covalency, and, much, more, stable, complexes, with, n, and, s, donors, complexes, of, zinc, are, mostly, 4, or, 6, coordinate, although, 5, coordinate, complexes, are, known, zinc, i, compounds, are, very, rare, the, 2, ion, is, implicated, by, the, formation, of, a, yellow, diamagnetic, glass, by, dissolving, metallic, zinc, in, molten, zncl, 2, the, 2, core, would, be, analogous, to, the, 2, cation, present, in, mercury, i, compounds, the, diamagnetic, nature, of, the, ion, confirms, its, dimeric, structure, the, first, zinc, i, compound, containing, the, zn, zn, bond, 5, c, 5, me, 5, 2, zn, 2, binary, compounds, of, zinc, are, known, for, most, of, the, metalloids, and, all, the, nonmetals, except, the, noble, gases, the, oxide, zno, is, a, white, powder, that, is, nearly, insoluble, in, neutral, aqueous, solutions, but, is, amphoteric, dissolving, in, both, strong, basic, and, acidic, solutions, the, other, chalcogenides, zns, znse, and, znte, have, varied, applications, in, electronics, and, optics, pnictogenides, zn, 3, n, 2, zn, 3, p, 2, zn, 3, as, 2, and, zn, 3,

isolated, examples, of, the, use, of, impure, zinc, in, ancient, times, have, been, discovered, zinc, ores, were, used, to, make, the, zinc, copper, alloy, brass, thousands, of, years, prior, to, the, discovery, of, zinc, as, a, separate, element, judean, brass, from, the, 14th, to, 10th, centuries, bc, contains, 23, zinc, knowledge, of, how, to, produce, brass, spread, to, ancient, greece, by, the, 7th, century, bc, but, few, varieties, were, made, ornaments, made, of, alloys, containing, 80, 90, zinc, with, lead, iron, antimony, and, other, metals, making, up, the, remainder, have, been, found, that, are, 2, 500, years, old, a, possibly, prehistoric, statuette, containing, 87, 5, zinc, was, found, in, a, dacian, archaeological, site, strabo, writing, in, the, 1st, century, bc, but, quoting, a, now, lost, work, of, the, 4th, century, bc, historian, theopompus, mentions, drops, of, false, silver, which, when, mixed, with, copper, make, brass, this, may, refer, to, small, quantities, of, zinc, that, is, a, by, product, of, smelting, sulfide, ores, zinc, in, such, remnants, in, smelting, ovens, was, usually, discarded, as, it, was, thought, to, be, worthless, the, manufacture, of, brass, was, known, to, the, romans, by, about, 30, bc, they, made, brass, by, heating, powdered, calamine, zinc, silicate, or, carbonate, charcoal, and, copper, together, in, a, crucible, the, resulting, calamine, brass, was, then, either, cast, or, hammered, into, shape, for, use, in, weaponry, some, coins, struck, by, romans, in, the, christian, era, are, made, of, what, is, probably, calamine, brass, the, oldest, known, pills, were, made, of, the, zinc, carbonates, hydrozincite, and, smithsonite, the, pills, were, used, for, sore, eyes, and, were, found, aboard, the, roman, ship, relitto, del, pozzino, wrecked, in, 140, bc, the, berne, zinc, tablet, is, a, votive, plaque, dating, to, roman, gaul, made, of, an, alloy, that, is, mostly, zinc, the, charaka, samhita, thought, to, have, been, written, between, 300, and, 500, ad, mentions, a, metal, which, when, oxidized, produces, pushpanjan, thought, to, be, zinc, oxide, zinc, mines, at, zawar, near, udaipur, in, india, have, been, active, since, the, mauryan, period, c, 322, and, 187, bce, the, smelting, of, metallic, zinc, here, however, appears, to, have, begun, around, the, 12th, century, ad, one, estimate, is, that, this, location, produced, an, estimated, million, tonnes, of, metallic, zinc, and, zinc, oxide, from, the, 12th, to, 16th, centuries, another, estimate, gives, a, total, production, of, 60, 000, tonnes, of, metallic, zinc, over, this, period, the, rasaratna, samuccaya, written, in, approximately, the, 13th, century, ad, mentions, two, types, of, zinc, containing, ores, one, used, for, metal, extraction, and, another, used, for, medicinal, purposes, zinc, was, distinctly, recognized, as, a, metal, under, the, designation, of, yasada, or, jasada, in, the, medical, lexicon, ascribed, to, the, hindu, king, madanapala, of, taka, dynasty, and, written, about, the, year, 1374, smelting, and, extraction, of, impure, zinc, by, reducing, calamine, with, wool, and, other, organic, substances, was, accomplished, in, the, 13th, century, in, india, the, chinese, did, not, learn, of, the, technique, until, the, 17th, century, alchemists, burned, zinc, metal, in, air, and, collected, the, resulting, zinc, oxide, on, a, condenser, some, alchemists, called, this, zinc, oxide, lana, philosophica, latin, for, philosopher, s, wool, because, it, collected, in, wooly, tufts, whereas, others, thought, it, looked, like, white, snow, and, named, it, nix, album, the, name, of, the, metal, was, probably, first, documented, by, paracelsus, a, swiss, born, german, alchemist, who, referred, to, the, metal, as, zincum, or, zinken, in, his, book, liber, mineralium, ii, in, the, 16th, century, the, word, is, probably, derived, from, the, german, zinke, and, supposedly, meant, tooth, like, pointed, or, jagged, metallic, zinc, crystals, have, a, needle, like, appearance, zink, could, also, imply, tin, like, because, of, its, relation, to, german, zinn, meaning, tin, yet, another, possibility, is, that, the, word, is, derived, from, the, persian, word, seng, meaning, stone, the, metal, was, also, called, indian, tin, tutanego, calamine, and, spinter, german, metallurgist, andreas, libavius, received, a, quantity, of, what, he, called, calay, from, the, malay, or, hindi, word, for, tin, originating, from, malabar, off, a, cargo, ship, captured, from, the, portuguese, in, the, year, 1596, libavius, described, the, properties, of, the, sample, which, may, have, been, zinc, zinc, was, regularly, imported, to, europe, from, the, orient, in, the, 17th, and, early, 18th, centuries, but, was, at, times, very, expensive, metallic, zinc, was, isolated, in, india, by, 1300, ad, before, it, was, isolated, in, europe, it, was, imported, from, india, in, about, 1600, ce, postlewayt, s, universal, dictionary, a, contemporary, source, giving, technological, information, in, europe, did, not, mention, zinc, before, 1751, but, the, element, was, studied, before, then, flemish, metallurgist, and, alchemist, p, m, de, respour, reported, that, he, had, extracted, metallic, zinc, from, zinc, oxide, in, 1668, by, the, start, of, the, 18th, century, tienne, fran, ois, geoffroy, described, how, zinc, oxide, condenses, as, yellow, crystals, on, bars, of, iron, placed, above, zinc, ore, that, is, being, smelted, in, britain, john, lane, is, said, to, have, carried, out, experiments, to, smelt, zinc, probably, at, landore, prior, to, his, bankruptcy, in, 1726, in, 1738, in, great, britain, william, champion, patented, a, process, to, extract, zinc, from, calamine, in, a, vertical, retort, style, smelter, his, technique, resembled, that, used, at, zawar, zinc, mines, in, rajasthan, but, no, evidence, suggests, he, visited, the, orient, champion, s, process, was, used, through, 1851, german, chemist, andreas, marggraf, normally, gets, credit, for, isolating, pure, metallic, zinc, in, the, west, even, though, swedish, chemist, anton, von, swab, had, distilled, zinc, from, calamine, four, years, previously, in, his, 1746, experiment, marggraf, heated, a, mixture, of, calamine, and, charcoal, in, a, closed, vessel, without, copper, to, obtain, a, metal, this, procedure, became, commercially, practical, by, 1752, william, champion, s, brother, john, patented, a, process, in, 1758, for, calcining, zinc, sulfide, into, an, oxide, usable, in, the, retort, process, prior, to, this, only, calamine, could, be, used, to, produce, zinc, in, 1798, johann, christian, ruberg, improved, on, the, smelting, process, by, building, the, first, horizontal, retort, smelter, jean, jacques, daniel, dony, built, a, different, kind, of, horizontal, zinc, smelter, in, belgium, that, processed, even, more, zinc, italian, doctor, luigi, galvani, discovered, in, 1780, that, connecting, the, spinal, cord, of, a, freshly, dissected, frog, to, an, iron, rail, attached, by, a, brass, hook, caused, the, frog, s, leg, to, twitch, he, incorrectly, thought, he, had, discovered, an, ability, of, nerves, and, muscles, to, create, electricity, and, called, the, effect, animal, electricity, the, galvanic, cell, and, the, process, of, galvanization, were, both, named, for, luigi, galvani, and, his, discoveries, paved, the, way, for, electrical, batteries, galvanization, and, cathodic, protection, galvani, s, friend, alessandro, volta, continued, researching, the, effect, and, invented, the, voltaic, pile, in, 1800, volta, s, pile, consisted, of, a, stack, of, simplified, galvanic, cells, each, being, one, plate, of, copper, and, one, of, zinc, connected, by, an, electrolyte, by, stacking, these, units, in, series, the, voltaic, pile, or, battery, as, a, whole, had, a, higher, voltage, which, could, be, used, more, easily, than, single, cells, electricity, is, produced, because, the, volta, potential, between, the, two, metal, plates, makes, electrons, flow, from, the, zinc, to, the, copper, and, corrode, the, zinc, the, non, magnetic, character, of, zinc, and, its, lack, of, color, in, solution, delayed, discovery, of, its, importance, to, biochemistry, and, nutrition, this, changed, in, 1940, when, carbonic, anhydrase, an, enzyme, that, scrubs, carbon, dioxide, from, blood, was, shown, to, have, zinc, in, its, active, site, the, digestive, enzyme, carboxypeptidase, became, the, second, known, zinc, containing, enzyme, in, 1955, zinc, is, the, fourth, most, common, metal, in, use, trailing, only, iron, aluminium, and, copper, with, an, annual, production, of, about, 13, million, tonnes, the, world, s, largest, zinc, producer, is, nyrstar, a, merger, of, the, australian, oz, minerals, and, the, belgian, umicore, about, 70, of, the, world, s, zinc, originates, from, mining, while, the, remaining, 30, comes, from, recycling, secondary, zinc, commercially, pure, zinc, is, known, as, special, high, grade, often, abbreviated, shg, and, is, 99, 995, pure, worldwide, 95, of, new, zinc,

same, safety, question, and, set, its, ul, at, 25, mg, day, which, is, much, lower, than, the, u, s, value, for, u, s, food, and, dietary, supplement, labeling, purposes, the, amount, in, a, serving, is, expressed, as, a, percent, of, daily, value, dv, for, zinc, labeling, purposes, 100, of, the, daily, value, was, 15, mg, but, on, may, 27, 2016, it, was, revised, to, 11, mg, a, table, of, the, old, and, new, adult, daily, values, is, provided, at, reference, daily, intake, animal, products, such, as, meat, fish, shellfish, fowl, eggs, and, dairy, contain, zinc, the, concentration, of, zinc, in, plants, varies, with, the, level, in, the, soil, with, adequate, zinc, in, the, soil, the, food, plants, that, contain, the, most, zinc, are, wheat, germ, and, bran, and, various, seeds, including, sesame, poppy, alfalfa, celery, and, mustard, zinc, is, also, found, in, beans, nuts, almonds, whole, grains, pumpkin, seeds, sunflower, seeds, and, blackcurrant, other, sources, include, fortified, food, and, dietary, supplements, in, various, forms, a, 1998, review, concluded, that, zinc, oxide, one, of, the, most, common, supplements, in, the, united, states, and, zinc, carbonate, are, nearly, insoluble, and, poorly, absorbed, in, the, body, this, review, cited, studies, that, found, lower, plasma, zinc, concentrations, in, the, subjects, who, consumed, zinc, oxide, and, zinc, carbonate, than, in, those, who, took, zinc, acetate, and, sulfate, salts, for, fortification, however, a, 2003, review, recommended, cereals, containing, zinc, oxide, as, a, cheap, stable, source, that, is, as, easily, absorbed, as, the, more, expensive, forms, a, 2005, study, found, that, various, compounds, of, zinc, including, oxide, and, sulfate, did, not, show, statistically, significant, differences, in, absorption, when, added, as, fortificants, to, maize, tortillas, nearly, two, billion, people, in, the, developing, world, are, deficient, in, zinc, groups, at, risk, include, children, in, developing, countries, and, elderly, with, chronic, illnesses, in, children, it, causes, an, increase, in, infection, and, diarrhea, and, contributes, to, the, death, of, about, 800, 000, children, worldwide, per, year, the, world, health, organization, advocates, zinc, supplementation, for, severe, malnutrition, and, diarrhea, zinc, supplements, help, prevent, disease, and, reduce, mortality, especially, among, children, with, low, birth, weight, or, stunted, growth, however, zinc, supplements, should, not, be, administered, alone, because, many, in, the, developing, world, have, several, deficiencies, and, zinc, interacts, with, other, micronutrients, while, zinc, deficiency, is, usually, due, to, insufficient, dietary, intake, it, can, be, associated, with, malabsorption, acrodermatitis, enteropathica, chronic, liver, disease, chronic, renal, disease, sickle, cell, disease, diabetes, malignancy, and, other, chronic, illnesses, in, the, united, states, a, federal, survey, of, food, consumption, determined, that, for, women, and, men, over, the, age, of, 19, average, consumption, was, 9, 7, and, 14, 2, mg, day, respectively, for, women, 17, consumed, less, than, the, ear, for, men, 11, the, percentages, below, ear, increased, with, age, the, most, recent, published, update, of, the, survey, nhanes, 2013, 2014, reported, lower, averages, 9, 3, and, 13, 2, mg, day, again, with, intake, decreasing, with, age, symptoms, of, mild, zinc, deficiency, are, diverse, clinical, outcomes, include, depressed, growth, diarrhea, impotence, and, delayed, sexual, maturation, alopecia, eye, and, skin, lesions, impaired, appetite, altered, cognition, impaired, immune, functions, defects, in, carbohydrate, use, and, reproductive, teratogenesis, zinc, deficiency, depresses, immunity, but, excessive, zinc, does, also, despite, some, concerns, western, vegetarians, and, vegans, do, not, suffer, any, more, from, overt, zinc, deficiency, than, meat, eaters, major, plant, sources, of, zinc, include, cooked, dried, beans, sea, vegetables, fortified, cereals, soy, foods, nuts, peas, and, seeds, however, phytates, in, many, whole, grains, and, fibers, may, interfere, with, zinc, absorption, and, marginal, zinc, intake, has, poorly, understood, effects, the, zinc, chelator, phytate, found, in, seeds, and, cereal, bran, can, contribute, to, zinc, malabsorption, some, evidence, suggests, that, more, than, the, us, rda, 8, mg, day, for, adult, women, 11, mg, day, for, adult, men, may, be, needed, in, those, whose, diet, is, high, in, phytates, such, as, some, vegetarians, the, european, food, safety, authority, efsa, guidelines, attempt, to, compensate, for, this, by, recommending, higher, zinc, intake, when, dietary, phytate, intake, is, greater, these, considerations, must, be, balanced, against, the, paucity, of, adequate, zinc, biomarkers, and, the, most, widely, used, indicator, plasma, zinc, has, poor, sensitivity, and, specificity, species, of, calluna, erica, and, vaccinium, can, grow, in, zinc, metalliferous, soils, because, translocation, of, toxic, ions, is, prevented, by, the, action, of, ericoid, mycorrhizal, fungi, zinc, deficiency, appears, to, be, the, most, common, micronutrient, deficiency, in, crop, plants, it, is, particularly, common, in, high, ph, soils, zinc, deficient, soil, is, cultivated, in, the, cropland, of, about, half, of, turkey, and, india, a, third, of, china, and, most, of, western, australia, substantial, responses, to, zinc, fertilization, have, been, reported, in, these, areas, plants, that, grow, in, soils, that, are, zinc, deficient, are, more, susceptible, to, disease, zinc, is, added, to, the, soil, primarily, through, the, weathering, of, rocks, but, humans, have, added, zinc, through, fossil, fuel, combustion, mine, waste, phosphate, fertilizers, pesticide, zinc, phosphide, limestone, manure, sewage, sludge, and, particles, from, galvanized, surfaces, excess, zinc, is, toxic, to, plants, although, zinc, toxicity, is, far, less, widespread, although, zinc, is, an, essential, requirement, for, good, health, excess, zinc, can, be, harmful, excessive, absorption, of, zinc, suppresses, copper, and, iron, absorption, the, free, zinc, ion, in, solution, is, highly, toxic, to, plants, invertebrates, and, even, vertebrate, fish, the, free, ion, activity, model, is, well, established, in, the, literature, and, shows, that, just, micromolar, amounts, of, the, free, ion, kills, some, organisms, a, recent, example, showed, 6, micromolar, killing, 93, of, all, daphnia, in, water, the, free, zinc, ion, is, a, powerful, lewis, acid, up, to, the, point, of, being, corrosive, stomach, acid, contains, hydrochloric, acid, in, which, metallic, zinc, dissolves, readily, to, give, corrosive, zinc, chloride, swallowing, a, post, 1982, american, one, cent, piece, 97, 5, zinc, can, cause, damage, to, the, stomach, lining, through, the, high, solubility, of, the, zinc, ion, in, the, acidic, stomach, evidence, shows, that, people, taking, 100, 300, mg, of, zinc, daily, may, suffer, induced, copper, deficiency, a, 2007, trial, observed, that, elderly, men, taking, 80, mg, daily, were, hospitalized, for, urinary, complications, more, often, than, those, taking, a, placebo, levels, of, 100, 300, mg, may, interfere, with, the, use, of, copper, and, iron, or, adversely, affect, cholesterol, zinc, in, excess, of, 500, ppm, in, soil, interferes, with, the, plant, absorption, of, other, essential, metals, such, as, iron, and, manganese, a, condition, called, the, zinc, shakes, or, zinc, chills, can, be, induced, by, inhalation, of, zinc, fumes, while, brazing, or, welding, galvanized, materials, zinc, is, a, common, ingredient, of, denture, cream, which, may, contain, between, 17, and, 38, mg, of, zinc, per, gram, disability, and, even, deaths, from, excessive, use, of, these, products, have, been, claimed, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, fda, states, that, zinc, damages, nerve, receptors, in, the, nose, causing, anosmia, reports, of, anosmia, were, also, observed, in, the, 1930s, when, zinc, preparations, were, used, in, a, failed, attempt, to, prevent, polio, infections, on, june, 16, 2009, the, fda, ordered, removal, of, zinc, based, intranasal, cold, products, from, store, shelves, the, fda, said, the, loss, of, smell, can, be, life, threatening, because, people, with, impaired, smell, cannot, detect, leaking, gas, or, smoke, and, cannot, tell, if, food, has, spoiled, before, they, eat, it, recent, research, suggests, that, the, topical, antimicrobial, zinc, pyrithione, is, a, potent, heat, shock, response, inducer, that, may, impair, genomic, integrity, with, induction, of, parp, dependent, energy, crisis, in, cultured, human, keratinocytes, and, melanocytes, in, 1982, the, us, mint, began, minting, pennies, coated, in, copper, but, containing, primarily, zinc, zinc, pennies, pose, a, risk, of, zinc, toxicosis, which, can, be, fatal, one, reported, case, of, chronic, ingestion, of, 425, pennies, over, 1, kg, of, zinc, resulted, in, death, due, to, gastrointestinal, bacterial, and, fungal, sepsis, another, patient, who, ingested, 12, grams, of, zinc, showed, only, lethargy, and, ataxia, gross, lack, of, coordination, of, muscle, movements, several, other, cases, have, been, reported, of, humans, suffering, zinc, intoxication, by, the, ingestion, of, zinc, coins, pennies, and, other, small, coins, are, sometimes, ingested, by, dogs, requiring, veterinary, removal, of, the, foreign, objects, the, zinc, content, of, some, coins, can, cause, zinc, toxicity, commonly, fatal, in, dogs, through, severe, hemolytic, anemia, and, liver, or, kidney, damage, vomiting, and, diarrhea, are, possible, symptoms, zinc, is, highly, toxic, in, parrots, and, poisoning, can, often, be, fatal, the, consumption, of, fruit, juices, stored, in, galvanized, cans, has, resulted, in, mass, parrot, poisonings, with, zinc
