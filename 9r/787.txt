permafrost, from, perma, permanent, and, frost, is, soil, or, underwater, sediment, which, continuously, remains, below, 0, c, 32, f, for, two, years, or, more, the, oldest, permafrost, had, been, continuously, frozen, for, around, 700, 000, years, whilst, the, shallowest, permafrost, has, a, vertical, extent, of, below, a, meter, 3, ft, the, deepest, is, greater, than, 1, 500, m, 4, 900, ft, similarly, the, area, of, individual, permafrost, zones, may, be, limited, to, narrow, mountain, summits, or, extend, across, vast, arctic, regions, the, ground, beneath, glaciers, and, ice, sheets, is, not, usually, defined, as, permafrost, so, on, land, permafrost, is, generally, located, beneath, a, so, called, active, layer, of, soil, which, freezes, and, thaws, depending, on, the, season, around, 15, of, the, northern, hemisphere, or, 11, of, the, global, surface, is, underlain, by, permafrost, covering, a, total, area, of, around, 18, million, km, 2, 6, 9, million, sq, mi, this, includes, large, areas, of, alaska, canada, greenland, and, siberia, it, is, also, located, in, high, mountain, regions, with, the, tibetan, plateau, being, a, prominent, example, only, a, minority, of, permafrost, exists, in, the, southern, hemisphere, where, it, is, consigned, to, mountain, slopes, like, in, the, andes, of, patagonia, the, southern, alps, of, new, zealand, or, the, highest, mountains, of, antarctica, permafrost, contains, large, amounts, of, dead, biomass, that, have, accumulated, throughout, millennia, without, having, had, the, chance, to, fully, decompose, and, release, their, carbon, making, tundra, soil, a, carbon, sink, as, global, warming, heats, the, ecosystem, frozen, soil, thaws, and, becomes, warm, enough, for, decomposition, to, start, anew, accelerating, the, permafrost, carbon, cycle, depending, on, conditions, at, the, time, of, thaw, decomposition, can, release, either, carbon, dioxide, or, methane, and, these, greenhouse, gas, emissions, act, as, a, climate, change, feedback, the, emissions, from, thawing, permafrost, will, have, a, sufficient, impact, on, the, climate, to, impact, global, carbon, budgets, it, is, difficult, to, accurately, predict, how, much, greenhouse, gases, the, permafrost, releases, because, of, the, different, thaw, processes, are, still, uncertain, there, is, widespread, agreement, that, the, emissions, will, be, smaller, than, human, caused, emissions, and, not, large, enough, to, result, in, runaway, warming, instead, the, annual, permafrost, emissions, are, likely, comparable, with, global, emissions, from, deforestation, or, to, annual, emissions, of, large, countries, such, as, russia, the, united, states, or, china, apart, from, its, climate, impact, permafrost, thaw, brings, more, risks, formerly, frozen, ground, often, contains, enough, ice, that, when, it, thaws, hydraulic, saturation, is, suddenly, exceeded, so, the, ground, shifts, substantially, and, may, even, collapse, outright, many, buildings, and, other, infrastructure, were, built, on, permafrost, when, it, was, frozen, and, stable, and, so, are, vulnerable, to, collapse, if, it, thaws, estimates, suggest, nearly, 70, of, such, infrastructure, is, at, risk, by, 2050, and, that, the, associated, costs, could, rise, to, tens, of, billions, of, dollars, in, the, second, half, of, the, century, furthermore, between, 13, 000, and, 20, 000, sites, contaminated, with, toxic, waste, are, present, in, the, permafrost, as, well, as, the, natural, mercury, deposits, which, are, all, liable, to, leak, and, pollute, the, environment, as, the, warming, progresses, lastly, concerns, have, been, raised, about, the, potential, for, pathogenic, microorganisms, surviving, the, thaw, and, contributing, to, future, pandemics, however, this, is, considered, unlikely, and, a, scientific, review, on, the, subject, describes, the, risks, as, generally, low, permafrost, is, soil, rock, or, sediment, that, is, frozen, for, more, than, two, consecutive, years, in, practice, this, means, that, permafrost, occurs, at, a, mean, annual, temperature, of, 2, c, 28, 4, f, or, below, in, the, coldest, regions, the, depth, of, continuous, permafrost, can, exceed, 1, 400, m, 4, 600, ft, it, typically, exists, beneath, the, so, called, active, layer, which, freezes, and, thaws, annually, and, so, can, support, plant, growth, as, the, roots, can, only, take, hold, in, the, soil, that, s, thawed, active, layer, thickness, is, measured, during, its, maximum, extent, at, the, end, of, summer, as, of, 2018, the, average, thickness, in, the, northern, hemisphere, is, 145, centimetres, 4, 76, ft, but, there, are, significant, regional, differences, northeastern, siberia, alaska, and, greenland, have, the, most, solid, permafrost, with, the, lowest, extent, of, active, layer, less, than, 50, centimetres, 1, 6, ft, on, average, and, sometimes, only, 30, centimetres, 0, 98, ft, while, southern, norway, and, the, mongolian, plateau, are, the, only, areas, where, the, average, active, layer, is, deeper, than, 600, centimetres, 20, ft, with, the, record, of, 10, metres, 33, ft, the, border, between, active, layer, and, permafrost, itself, is, sometimes, called, permafrost, table, around, 15, of, northern, hemisphere, land, that, is, not, completely, covered, by, ice, is, directly, underlain, by, permafrost, 22, is, defined, as, part, of, a, permafrost, zone, or, region, this, is, because, only, slightly, more, than, half, of, this, area, is, defined, as, a, continuous, permafrost, zone, where, 90, 100, of, the, land, is, underlain, by, permafrost, around, 20, is, instead, defined, as, discontinuous, permafrost, where, the, coverage, is, between, 50, and, 90, finally, the, remaining, 30, of, permafrost, regions, consists, of, areas, with, 10, 50, coverage, which, are, defined, as, sporadic, permafrost, zones, and, some, areas, that, have, isolated, patches, of, permafrost, covering, 10, or, less, of, their, area, 435, most, of, this, area, is, found, in, siberia, northern, canada, alaska, and, greenland, beneath, the, active, layer, annual, temperature, swings, of, permafrost, become, smaller, with, depth, the, greatest, depth, of, permafrost, occurs, right, before, the, point, where, geothermal, heat, maintains, a, temperature, above, freezing, above, that, bottom, limit, there, may, be, permafrost, with, a, consistent, annual, temperature, isothermal, permafrost, permafrost, typically, forms, in, any, climate, where, the, mean, annual, air, temperature, is, lower, than, the, freezing, point, of, water, exceptions, are, found, in, humid, boreal, forests, such, as, in, northern, scandinavia, and, the, north, eastern, part, of, european, russia, west, of, the, urals, where, snow, acts, as, an, insulating, blanket, glaciated, areas, may, also, be, exceptions, since, all, glaciers, are, warmed, at, their, base, by, geothermal, heat, temperate, glaciers, which, are, near, the, pressure, melting, point, throughout, may, have, liquid, water, at, the, interface, with, the, ground, and, are, therefore, free, of, underlying, permafrost, fossil, cold, anomalies, in, the, geothermal, gradient, in, areas, where, deep, permafrost, developed, during, the, pleistocene, persist, down, to, several, hundred, metres, this, is, evident, from, temperature, measurements, in, boreholes, in, north, america, and, europe, the, below, ground, temperature, varies, less, from, season, to, season, than, the, air, temperature, with, mean, annual, temperatures, tending, to, increase, with, depth, due, to, the, geothermal, crustal, gradient, thus, if, the, mean, annual, air, temperature, is, only, slightly, below, 0, c, 32, f, permafrost, will, form, only, in, spots, that, are, sheltered, usually, with, a, northern, or, southern, aspect, in, the, north, and, south, hemispheres, respectively, creating, discontinuous, permafrost, usually, permafrost, will, remain, discontinuous, in, a, climate, where, the, mean, annual, soil, surface, temperature, is, between, 5, and, 0, c, 23, and, 32, f, in, the, moist, wintered, areas, mentioned, before, there, may, not, even, be, discontinuous, permafrost, down, to, 2, c, 28, f, discontinuous, permafrost, is, often, further, divided, into, extensive, discontinuous, permafrost, where, permafrost, covers, between, 50, and, 90, percent, of, the, landscape, and, is, usually, found, in, areas, with, mean, annual, temperatures, between, 2, and, 4, c, 28, and, 25, f, and, sporadic, permafrost, where, permafrost, cover, is, less, than, 50, percent, of, the, landscape, and, typically, occurs, at, mean, annual, temperatures, between, 0, and, 2, c, 32, and, 28, f, in, soil, science, the, sporadic, permafrost, zone, is, abbreviated, spz, and, the, extensive, discontinuous, permafrost, zone, dpz, exceptions, occur, in, un, glaciated, siberia, and, alaska, where, the, present, depth, of, permafrost, is, a, relic, of, climatic, conditions, during, glacial, ages, where, winters, were, up, to, 11, c, 20, f, colder, than, those, of, today, at, mean, annual, soil, surface, temperatures, below, 5, c, 23, f, the, influence, of, aspect, can, never, be, sufficient, to, thaw, permafrost, and, a, zone, of, continuous, permafrost, abbreviated, to, cpz, forms, a, line, of, continuous, permafrost, in, the, northern, hemisphere, represents, the, most, southern, border, where, land, is, covered, by, continuous, permafrost, or, glacial, ice, the, line, of, continuous, permafrost, varies, around, the, world, northward, or, southward, due, to, regional, climatic, changes, in, the, southern, hemisphere, most, of, the, equivalent, line, would, fall, within, the, southern, ocean, if, there, were, land, there, most, of, the, antarctic, continent, is, overlain, by, glaciers, under, which, much, of, the, terrain, is, subject, to, basal, melting, the, exposed, land, of, antarctica, is, substantially, underlain, with, permafrost, some, of, which, is, subject, to, warming, and, thawing, along, the, coastline, a, range, of, elevations, in, both, the, northern, and, southern, hemisphere, are, cold, enough, to, support, perennially, frozen, ground, some, of, the, best, known, examples, include, the, canadian, rockies, the, european, alps, himalaya, and, the, tien, shan, in, general, it, has, been, found, that, extensive, alpine, permafrost, requires, mean, annual, air, temperature, of, 3, c, 27, f, though, this, can, vary, depending, on, local, topography, and, some, mountain, areas, are, known, to, support, permafrost, at, 1, c, 30, f, it, is, also, possible, for, subsurface, alpine, permafrost, to, be, covered, by, warmer, vegetation, supporting, soil, alpine, permafrost, is, particularly, difficult, to, study, and, systematic, research, efforts, did, not, begin, until, the, 1970s, consequently, there, remain, uncertainties, about, its, geography, as, recently, as, 2009, permafrost, had, been, discovered, in, a, new, area, africa, s, highest, peak, mount, kilimanjaro, 4, 700, m, 15, 400, ft, above, sea, level, and, approximately, 3, south, of, the, equator, in, 2014, a, collection, of, regional, estimates, of, alpine, permafrost, extent, had, established, a, global, extent, of, 3, 560, 000, km, 2, 1, 370, 000, sq, mi, yet, by, 2014, alpine, permafrost, in, the, andes, has, not, been, fully, mapped, although, its, extent, has, been, modeled, to, assess, the, amount, of, water, bound, up, in, these, areas, subsea, permafrost, occurs, beneath, the, seabed, and, exists, in, the, continental, shelves, of, the, polar, regions, these, areas, formed, during, the, last, ice, age, when, a, larger, portion, of, earth, s, water, was, bound, up, in, ice, sheets, on, land, and, when, sea, levels, were, low, as, the, ice, sheets, melted, to, again, become, seawater, during, the, holocene, glacial, retreat, coastal, permafrost, became, submerged, shelves, under, relatively, warm, and, salty, boundary, conditions, compared, to, surface, permafrost, since, then, these, conditions, led, to, the, gradual, and, ongoing, decline, of, subsea, permafrost, extent, nevertheless, its, presence, remains, an, important, consideration, for, the, design, construction, and, operation, of, coastal, facilities, structures, founded, on, the, seabed, artificial, islands, sub, sea, pipelines, and, wells, drilled, for, exploration, and, production, subsea, permafrost, can, also, overlay, deposits, of, methane, clathrate, which, were, once, speculated, to, be, a, major, climate, tipping, point, in, what, was, known, as, a, clathrate, gun, hypothesis, but, are, now, no, longer, believed, to, play, any, role, in, projected, climate, change, at, the, last, glacial, maximum, continuous, permafrost, covered, a, much, greater, area, than, it, does, today, covering, all, of, ice, free, europe, south, to, about, szeged, southeastern, hungary, and, the, sea, of, azov, then, dry, land, and, east, asia, south, to, present, day, changchun, and, abashiri, in, north, america, only, an, extremely, narrow, belt, of, permafrost, existed, south, of, the, ice, sheet, at, about, the, latitude, of, new, jersey, through, southern, iowa, and, northern, missouri, but, permafrost, was, more, extensive, in, the, drier, western, regions, where, it, extended, to, the, southern, border, of, idaho, and, oregon, in, the, southern, hemisphere, there, is, some, evidence, for, former, permafrost, from, this, period, in, central, otago, and, argentine, patagonia, but, was, probably, discontinuous, and, is, related, to, the, tundra, alpine, permafrost, also, occurred, in, the, drakensberg, during, glacial, maxima, above, about, 3, 000, metres, 9, 840, ft, permafrost, extends, to, a, base, depth, where, geothermal, heat, from, the, earth, and, the, mean, annual, temperature, at, the, surface, achieve, an, equilibrium, temperature, of, 0, c, 32, f, this, base, depth, of, permafrost, can, vary, wildly, it, is, less, than, a, meter, 3, ft, in, the, areas, where, it, is, shallowest, yet, reaches, 1, 493, m, 4, 898, ft, in, the, northern, lena, and, yana, river, basins, in, siberia, calculations, indicate, that, the, formation, time, of, permafrost, greatly, slows, past, the, first, several, metres, for, instance, over, half, a, million, years, was, required, to, form, the, deep, permafrost, underlying, prudhoe, bay, alaska, a, time, period, extending, over, several, glacial, and, interglacial, cycles, of, the, pleistocene, 18, base, depth, is, affected, by, the, underlying, geology, and, particularly, by, thermal, conductivity, which, is, lower, for, permafrost, in, soil, than, in, bedrock, lower, conductivity, leaves, permafrost, less, affected, by, the, geothermal, gradient, which, is, the, rate, of, increasing, temperature, with, respect, to, increasing, depth, in, the, earth, s, interior, it, occurs, as, the, earth, s, internal, thermal, energy, is, generated, by, radioactive, decay, of, unstable, isotopes, and, flows, to, the, surface, by, conduction, at, a, rate, of, 47, terawatts, tw, away, from, tectonic, plate, boundaries, this, is, equivalent, to, an, average, heat, flow, of, 25, 30, c, km, 124, 139, f, mi, near, the, surface, when, the, ice, content, of, a, permafrost, exceeds, 250, percent, ice, to, dry, soil, by, mass, it, is, classified, as, massive, ice, massive, ice, bodies, can, range, in, composition, in, every, conceivable, gradation, from, icy, mud, to, pure, ice, massive, icy, beds, have, a, minimum, thickness, of, at, least, 2, m, and, a, short, diameter, of, at, least, 10, m, first, recorded, north, american, observations, of, this, phenomenon, were, by, european, scientists, at, canning, river, alaska, in, 1919, russian, literature, provides, an, earlier, date, of, 1735, and, 1739, during, the, great, north, expedition, by, p, lassinius, and, khariton, laptev, respectively, russian, investigators, including, i, a, lopatin, b, khegbomov, s, taber, and, g, beskow, had, also, formulated, the, original, theories, for, ice, inclusion, in, freezing, soils, while, there, are, four, categories, of, ice, in, permafrost, pore, ice, ice, wedges, also, known, as, vein, ice, buried, surface, ice, and, intrasedimental, sometimes, also, called, constitutional, ice, only, the, last, two, tend, to, be, large, enough, to, qualify, as, massive, ground, ice, these, two, types, usually, occur, separately, but, may, be, found, together, like, on, the, coast, of, tuktoyaktuk, in, western, arctic, canada, where, the, remains, of, laurentide, ice, sheet, are, located, buried, surface, ice, may, derive, from, snow, frozen, lake, or, sea, ice, aufeis, stranded, river, ice, and, even, buried, glacial, ice, from, the, former, pleistocene, ice, sheets, the, latter, hold, enormous, value, for, paleoglaciological, research, yet, even, as, of, 2022, the, total, extent, and, volume, of, such, buried, ancient, ice, is, unknown, notable, sites, with, known, ancient, ice, deposits, include, yenisei, river, valley, in, siberia, russia, as, well, as, banks, and, bylot, island, in, canada, s, nunavut, and, northwest, territories, some, of, the, buried, ice, sheet, remnants, are, known, to, host, thermokarst, lakes, intrasedimental, or, constitutional, ice, has, been, widely, observed, and, studied, across, canada, it, forms, when, subterranean, waters, freeze, in, place, and, is, subdivided, into, intrusive, injection, and, segregational, ice, the, latter, is, the, dominant, type, formed, after, crystallizational, differentiation, in, wet, sediments, which, occurs, when, water, migrates, to, the, freezing, front, under, the, influence, of, van, der, waals, forces, this, is, a, slow, process, which, primarily, occurs, in, silts, with, salinity, less, than, 20, of, seawater, silt, sediments, with, higher, salinity, and, clay, sediments, instead, have, water, movement, prior, to, ice, formation, dominated, by, rheological, processes, consequently, it, takes, between, 1, and, 1000, years, to, form, intrasedimental, ice, in, the, top, 2, 5, meters, of, clay, sediments, yet, it, takes, between, 10, and, 10, 000, years, for, peat, sediments, and, between, 1, 000, and, 1, 000, 000, years, for, silt, sediments, permafrost, processes, such, as, thermal, contraction, generating, cracks, which, eventually, become, ice, wedges, and, solifluction, gradual, movement, of, soil, down, the, slope, as, it, repeatedly, freezes, and, thaws, often, lead, to, the, formation, of, ground, polygons, rings, steps, and, other, forms, of, patterned, ground, found, in, arctic, periglacial, and, alpine, areas, in, ice, rich, permafrost, areas, melting, of, ground, ice, initiates, thermokarst, landforms, such, as, thermokarst, lakes, thaw, slumps, thermal, erosion, gullies, and, active, layer, detachments, notably, unusually, deep, permafrost, in, arctic, moorlands, and, bogs, often, attracts, meltwater, in, warmer, seasons, which, pools, and, freezes, to, form, ice, lenses, and, the, surrounding, ground, begins, to, jut, outward, at, a, slope, this, can, eventually, result, in, the, formation, of, large, scale, land, forms, around, this, core, of, permafrost, such, as, palsas, long, 15, 150, m, 49, 492, ft, wide, 10, 30, m, 33, 98, ft, yet, shallow, 1, 6, m, 3, ft, 3, in, 19, ft, 8, in, tall, peat, mounds, and, the, even, larger, pingos, which, can, be, 3, 70, m, 10, 230, ft, high, and, 30, 1, 000, m, 98, 3, 281, ft, in, diameter, only, plants, with, shallow, roots, can, survive, in, the, presence, of, permafrost, black, spruce, tolerates, limited, rooting, zones, and, dominates, flora, where, permafrost, is, extensive, likewise, animal, species, which, live, in, dens, and, burrows, have, their, habitat, constrained, by, the, permafrost, and, these, constraints, also, have, a, secondary, impact, on, interactions, between, species, within, the, ecosystem, while, permafrost, soil, is, frozen, it, is, not, completely, inhospitable, to, microorganisms, though, their, numbers, can, vary, widely, typically, from, 1, to, 1000, million, per, gram, of, soil, the, permafrost, carbon, cycle, arctic, carbon, cycle, deals, with, the, transfer, of, carbon, from, permafrost, soils, to, terrestrial, vegetation, and, microbes, to, the, atmosphere, back, to, vegetation, and, finally, back, to, permafrost, soils, through, burial, and, sedimentation, due, to, cryogenic, processes, some, of, this, carbon, is, transferred, to, the, ocean, and, other, portions, of, the, globe, through, the, global, carbon, cycle, the, cycle, includes, the, exchange, of, carbon, dioxide, and, methane, between, terrestrial, components, and, the, atmosphere, as, well, as, the, transfer, of, carbon, between, land, and, water, as, methane, dissolved, organic, carbon, dissolved, inorganic, carbon, particulate, inorganic, carbon, and, particulate, organic, carbon, most, of, the, bacteria, and, fungi, found, in, permafrost, cannot, be, cultured, in, the, laboratory, but, the, identity, of, the, microorganisms, can, be, revealed, by, dna, based, techniques, for, instance, analysis, of, 16s, rrna, genes, from, late, pleistocene, permafrost, samples, in, eastern, siberia, s, kolyma, lowland, revealed, eight, phylotypes, which, belonged, to, the, phyla, actinomycetota, and, pseudomonadota, muot, da, barba, peider, an, alpine, permafrost, site, in, eastern, switzerland, was, found, to, host, a, diverse, microbial, community, in, 2016, prominent, bacteria, groups, included, phylum, acidobacteriota, actinomycetota, ad3, bacteroidota, chloroflexota, gemmatimonadota, od1, nitrospirota, planctomycetota, pseudomonadota, and, verrucomicrobiota, in, addition, to, eukaryotic, fungi, like, ascomycota, basidiomycota, and, zygomycota, in, the, presently, living, species, scientists, observed, a, variety, of, adaptations, for, sub, zero, conditions, including, reduced, and, anaerobic, metabolic, processes, there, are, only, two, large, cities, in, the, world, built, in, areas, of, continuous, permafrost, where, the, frozen, soil, forms, an, unbroken, below, zero, sheet, and, both, are, in, russia, norilsk, in, krasnoyarsk, krai, and, yakutsk, in, the, sakha, republic, building, on, permafrost, is, difficult, because, the, heat, of, the, building, or, pipeline, can, spread, to, the, soil, thawing, it, as, ice, content, turns, to, water, the, ground, s, ability, to, provide, structural, support, is, weakened, until, the, building, is, destabilized, for, instance, during, the, construction, of, the, trans, siberian, railway, a, steam, engine, factory, complex, built, in, 1901, began, to, crumble, within, a, month, of, operations, for, these, reasons, 47, additionally, there, is, no, groundwater, available, in, an, area, underlain, with, permafrost, any, substantial, settlement, or, installation, needs, to, make, some, alternative, arrangement, to, obtain, water, 25, a, common, solution, is, placing, foundations, on, wood, piles, a, technique, pioneered, by, soviet, engineer, mikhail, kim, in, norilsk, however, warming, induced, change, of, friction, on, the, piles, can, still, cause, movement, through, creep, even, as, the, soil, remains, frozen, the, melnikov, permafrost, institute, in, yakutsk, found, that, pile, foundations, should, extend, down, to, 15, metres, 49, ft, to, avoid, the, risk, of, buildings, sinking, at, this, depth, the, temperature, does, not, change, with, the, seasons, remaining, at, about, 5, c, 23, f, two, other, approaches, are, building, on, an, extensive, gravel, pad, usually, 1, 2, m, 3, ft, 3, in, 6, ft, 7, in, thick, or, using, anhydrous, ammonia, heat, pipes, the, trans, alaska, pipeline, system, uses, heat, pipes, built, into, vertical, supports, to, prevent, the, pipeline, from, sinking, and, the, qingzang, railway, in, tibet, employs, a, variety, of, methods, to, keep, the, ground, cool, both, in, areas, with, frost, susceptible, soil, permafrost, may, necessitate, special, enclosures, for, buried, utilities, called, utilidors, globally, permafrost, warmed, by, about, 0, 3, c, 0, 54, f, between, 2007, and, 2016, with, stronger, warming, observed, in, the, continuous, permafrost, zone, relative, to, the, discontinuous, zone, observed, warming, was, up, to, 3, c, 5, 4, f, in, parts, of, northern, alaska, early, 1980s, to, mid, 2000s, and, up, to, 2, c, 3, 6, f, in, parts, of, the, russian, european, north, 1970, 2020, this, warming, inevitably, causes, permafrost, to, thaw, active, layer, thickness, has, increased, in, the, european, and, russian, arctic, across, the, 21st, century, and, at, high, elevation, areas, in, europe, and, asia, since, the, 1990s, 1237, between, 2000, and, 2018, the, average, active, layer, thickness, had, increased, from, 127, centimetres, 4, 17, ft, to, 145, centimetres, 4, 76, ft, at, an, average, annual, rate, of, 0, 65, centimetres, 0, 26, in, in, yukon, the, zone, of, continuous, permafrost, might, have, moved, 100, kilometres, 62, mi, poleward, since, 1899, but, accurate, records, only, go, back, 30, years, the, extent, of, subsea, permafrost, is, decreasing, as, well, as, of, 2019, 97, of, permafrost, under, arctic, ice, shelves, is, becoming, warmer, and, thinner, 1281, based, on, high, agreement, across, model, projections, fundamental, process, understanding, and, paleoclimate, evidence, it, is, virtually, certain, that, permafrost, extent, and, volume, will, continue, to, shrink, as, the, global, climate, warms, with, the, extent, of, the, losses, determined, by, the, magnitude, of, warming, 1283, permafrost, thaw, is, associated, with, a, wide, range, of, issues, and, international, permafrost, association, ipa, exists, to, help, address, them, it, convenes, international, permafrost, conferences, and, maintains, global, terrestrial, network, for, permafrost, which, undertakes, special, projects, such, as, preparing, databases, maps, bibliographies, and, glossaries, and, coordinates, international, field, programmes, and, networks, as, recent, warming, deepens, the, active, layer, subject, to, permafrost, thaw, this, exposes, formerly, stored, carbon, to, biogenic, processes, which, facilitate, its, entrance, into, the, atmosphere, as, carbon, dioxide, and, methane, because, carbon, emissions, from, permafrost, thaw, contribute, to, the, same, warming, which, facilitates, the, thaw, it, is, a, well, known, example, of, a, positive, climate, change, feedback, and, because, widespread, permafrost, thaw, is, effectively, irreversible, it, is, also, considered, one, of, tipping, points, in, the, climate, system, in, the, northern, circumpolar, region, permafrost, contains, organic, matter, equivalent, to, 1400, 1650, billion, tons, of, pure, carbon, which, was, built, up, over, thousands, of, years, this, amount, equals, almost, half, of, all, organic, material, in, all, soils, and, it, is, about, twice, the, carbon, content, of, the, atmosphere, or, around, four, times, larger, than, the, human, emissions, of, carbon, between, the, start, of, the, industrial, revolution, and, 2011, further, most, of, this, carbon, 1, 035, billion, tons, is, stored, in, what, is, defined, as, the, near, surface, permafrost, no, deeper, than, 3, metres, 9, 8, ft, below, the, surface, however, only, a, fraction, of, this, stored, carbon, is, expected, to, enter, the, atmosphere, in, general, the, volume, of, permafrost, in, the, upper, 3, m, of, ground, is, expected, to, decrease, by, about, 25, per, 1, c, 1, 8, f, of, global, warming, 1283, yet, even, under, the, rcp8, 5, scenario, associated, with, over, 4, c, 7, 2, f, of, global, warming, by, the, end, of, the, 21st, century, about, 5, to, 15, of, permafrost, carbon, is, expected, to, be, lost, over, decades, and, centuries, the, exact, amount, of, carbon, that, will, be, released, due, to, warming, in, a, given, permafrost, area, depends, on, depth, of, thaw, carbon, content, within, the, thawed, soil, physical, changes, to, the, environment, and, microbial, and, vegetation, activity, in, the, soil, notably, estimates, of, carbon, release, alone, do, not, fully, represent, the, impact, of, permafrost, thaw, on, climate, change, this, is, because, carbon, can, be, released, through, either, aerobic, or, anaerobic, respiration, which, results, in, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, or, methane, ch, 4, emissions, respectively, while, methane, lasts, less, than, 12, years, in, the, atmosphere, its, global, warming, potential, is, around, 80, times, larger, than, that, of, co, 2, over, a, 20, year, period, and, about, 28, times, larger, over, a, 100, year, period, while, only, a, small, fraction, of, permafrost, carbon, will, enter, the, atmosphere, as, methane, those, emissions, will, cause, 40, 70, of, the, total, warming, caused, by, permafrost, thaw, during, the, 21st, century, much, of, the, uncertainty, about, the, eventual, extent, of, permafrost, methane, emissions, is, caused, by, the, difficulty, of, accounting, for, the, recently, discovered, abrupt, thaw, processes, which, often, increase, the, fraction, of, methane, emitted, over, carbon, dioxide, in, comparison, to, the, usual, gradual, thaw, processes, another, factor, which, complicates, projections, of, permafrost, carbon, emissions, is, the, ongoing, greening, of, the, arctic, as, climate, change, warms, the, air, and, the, soil, the, region, becomes, more, hospitable, to, plants, including, larger, shrubs, and, trees, which, could, not, survive, there, before, thus, the, arctic, is, losing, more, and, more, of, its, tundra, biomes, yet, it, gains, more, plants, which, proceed, to, absorb, more, carbon, some, of, the, emissions, caused, by, permafrost, thaw, will, be, offset, by, this, increased, plant, growth, but, the, exact, proportion, is, uncertain, it, is, considered, very, unlikely, that, this, greening, could, offset, all, of, the, emissions, from, permafrost, thaw, during, the, 21st, century, and, even, less, likely, that, it, could, continue, to, keep, pace, with, those, emissions, after, the, 21st, century, further, climate, change, also, increases, the, risk, of, wildfires, in, the, arctic, which, can, substantially, accelerate, emissions, of, permafrost, carbon, altogether, it, is, expected, that, cumulative, greenhouse, gas, emissions, from, permafrost, thaw, will, be, smaller, than, the, cumulative, anthropogenic, emissions, yet, still, substantial, on, a, global, scale, with, some, experts, comparing, them, to, emissions, caused, by, deforestation, the, ipcc, sixth, assessment, report, estimates, that, carbon, dioxide, and, methane, released, from, permafrost, could, amount, to, the, equivalent, of, 14, 175, billion, tonnes, of, carbon, dioxide, per, 1, c, 1, 8, f, of, warming, 1237, for, comparison, by, 2019, annual, anthropogenic, emissions, of, carbon, dioxide, alone, stood, around, 40, billion, tonnes, 1237, a, major, review, published, in, the, year, 2022, concluded, that, if, the, goal, of, preventing, 2, c, 3, 6, f, of, warming, was, realized, then, the, average, annual, permafrost, emissions, throughout, the, 21st, century, would, be, equivalent, to, the, year, 2019, annual, emissions, of, russia, under, rcp4, 5, a, scenario, considered, close, to, the, current, trajectory, and, where, the, warming, stays, slightly, below, 3, c, 5, 4, f, annual, permafrost, emissions, would, be, comparable, to, year, 2019, emissions, of, western, europe, or, the, united, states, while, under, the, scenario, of, high, global, warming, and, worst, case, permafrost, feedback, response, they, would, approach, year, 2019, emissions, of, china, fewer, studies, have, attempted, to, describe, the, impact, directly, in, terms, of, warming, a, 2018, paper, estimated, that, if, global, warming, was, limited, to, 2, c, 3, 6, f, gradual, permafrost, thaw, would, add, around, 0, 09, c, 0, 16, f, to, global, temperatures, by, 2100, while, a, 2022, review, concluded, that, every, 1, c, 1, 8, f, of, global, warming, would, cause, 0, 04, c, 0, 072, f, and, 0, 11, c, 0, 20, f, from, abrupt, thaw, by, the, year, 2100, and, 2300, around, 4, c, 7, 2, f, of, global, warming, abrupt, around, 50, years, and, widespread, collapse, of, permafrost, areas, could, occur, resulting, in, an, additional, warming, of, 0, 2, 0, 4, c, 0, 36, 0, 72, f, as, the, water, drains, or, evaporates, soil, structure, weakens, and, sometimes, becomes, viscous, until, it, regains, strength, with, decreasing, moisture, content, one, visible, sign, of, permafrost, degradation, is, the, random, displacement, of, trees, from, their, vertical, orientation, in, permafrost, areas, global, warming, has, been, increasing, permafrost, slope, disturbances, and, sediment, supplies, to, fluvial, systems, resulting, in, exceptional, increases, in, river, sediment, on, the, other, hands, disturbance, of, formerly, hard, soil, increases, drainage, of, water, reservoirs, in, northern, wetlands, this, can, dry, them, out, and, compromise, the, survival, of, plants, and, animals, used, to, the, wetland, ecosystem, in, high, mountains, much, of, the, structural, stability, can, be, attributed, to, glaciers, and, permafrost, as, climate, warms, permafrost, thaws, decreasing, slope, stability, and, increasing, stress, through, buildup, of, pore, water, pressure, which, may, ultimately, lead, to, slope, failure, and, rockfalls, over, the, past, century, an, increasing, number, of, alpine, rock, slope, failure, events, in, mountain, ranges, around, the, world, have, been, recorded, and, some, have, been, attributed, to, permafrost, thaw, induced, by, climate, change, the, 1987, val, pola, landslide, that, killed, 22, people, in, the, italian, alps, is, considered, one, such, example, in, 2002, massive, rock, and, ice, falls, up, to, 11, 8, million, m, 3, earthquakes, up, to, 3, 9, richter, floods, up, to, 7, 8, million, m, 3, water, and, rapid, rock, ice, flow, to, long, distances, up, to, 7, 5, km, at, 60, m, s, were, attributed, to, slope, instability, in, high, mountain, permafrost, permafrost, thaw, can, also, result, in, the, formation, of, frozen, debris, lobes, fdls, which, are, defined, as, slow, moving, landslides, composed, of, soil, rocks, trees, and, ice, this, is, a, notable, issue, in, the, alaska, s, southern, brooks, range, where, some, fdls, measured, over, 100, m, 110, yd, in, width, 20, m, 22, yd, in, height, and, 1, 000, m, 1, 100, yd, in, length, by, 2012, as, of, december, 2021, there, were, 43, frozen, debris, lobes, identified, in, the, southern, brooks, range, where, they, could, potentially, threaten, both, the, trans, alaska, pipeline, system, taps, corridor, and, the, dalton, highway, which, is, the, main, transport, link, between, the, interior, alaska, and, the, alaska, north, slope, as, of, 2021, there, are, 1162, settlements, located, directly, atop, the, arctic, permafrost, which, host, an, estimated, 5, million, people, by, 2050, permafrost, layer, below, 42, of, these, settlements, is, expected, to, thaw, affecting, all, their, inhabitants, currently, 3, 3, million, people, consequently, a, wide, range, of, infrastructure, in, permafrost, areas, is, threatened, by, the, thaw, 236, by, 2050, it, s, estimated, that, nearly, 70, of, global, infrastructure, located, in, the, permafrost, areas, would, be, at, high, risk, of, permafrost, thaw, including, 30, 50, of, critical, infrastructure, the, associated, costs, could, reach, tens, of, billions, of, dollars, by, the, second, half, of, the, century, reducing, greenhouse, gas, emissions, in, line, with, the, paris, agreement, is, projected, to, stabilize, the, risk, after, mid, century, otherwise, it, ll, continue, to, worsen, in, alaska, alone, damages, to, infrastructure, by, the, end, of, the, century, would, amount, to, 4, 6, billion, at, 2015, dollar, value, if, rcp8, 5, the, high, emission, climate, change, scenario, were, realized, over, half, stems, from, the, damage, to, buildings, 2, 8, billion, but, there, s, also, damage, to, roads, 700, million, railroads, 620, million, airports, 360, million, and, pipelines, 170, million, similar, estimates, were, done, for, rcp4, 5, a, less, intense, scenario, which, leads, to, around, 2, 5, c, 4, 5, f, by, 2100, a, level, of, warming, similar, to, the, current, projections, in, that, case, total, damages, from, permafrost, thaw, are, reduced, to, 3, billion, while, damages, to, roads, and, railroads, are, lessened, by, approximately, two, thirds, from, 700, and, 620, million, to, 190, and, 220, million, and, damages, to, pipelines, are, reduced, more, than, ten, fold, from, 170, million, to, 16, million, unlike, the, other, costs, stemming, from, climate, change, in, alaska, such, as, damages, from, increased, precipitation, and, flooding, climate, change, adaptation, is, not, a, viable, way, to, reduce, damages, from, permafrost, thaw, as, it, would, cost, more, than, the, damage, incurred, under, either, scenario, in, canada, northwest, territories, have, a, population, of, only, 45, 000, people, in, 33, communities, yet, permafrost, thaw, is, expected, to, cost, them, 1, 3, billion, over, 75, years, or, around, 51, million, a, year, in, 2006, the, cost, of, adapting, inuvialuit, homes, to, permafrost, thaw, was, estimated, at, 208, m, 2, if, they, were, built, at, pile, foundations, and, 1, 000, m, 2, if, they, didn, t, at, the, time, the, average, area, of, a, residential, building, in, the, territory, was, around, 100, m, 2, thaw, induced, damage, is, also, unlikely, to, be, covered, by, home, insurance, and, to, address, this, reality, territorial, government, currently, funds, contributing, assistance, for, repairs, and, enhancements, care, and, securing, assistance, for, emergencies, safe, programs, which, provide, long, and, short, term, forgivable, loans, to, help, homeowners, adapt, it, is, possible, that, in, the, future, mandatory, relocation, would, instead, take, place, as, the, cheaper, option, however, it, would, effectively, tear, the, local, inuit, away, from, their, ancestral, homelands, right, now, their, average, personal, income, is, only, half, that, of, the, median, nwt, resident, meaning, that, adaptation, costs, are, already, disproportionate, for, them, by, 2022, up, to, 80, of, buildings, in, some, northern, russia, cities, had, already, experienced, damage, by, 2050, the, damage, to, residential, infrastructure, may, reach, 15, billion, while, total, public, infrastructure, damages, could, amount, to, 132, billion, this, includes, oil, and, gas, extraction, facilities, of, which, 45, are, believed, to, be, at, risk, outside, of, the, arctic, qinghai, tibet, plateau, sometimes, known, as, the, third, pole, also, has, an, extensive, permafrost, area, it, is, warming, at, twice, the, global, average, rate, and, 40, of, it, is, already, considered, warm, permafrost, making, it, particularly, unstable, qinghai, tibet, plateau, has, a, population, of, over, 10, million, people, double, the, population, of, permafrost, regions, in, the, arctic, and, over, 1, million, m, 2, of, buildings, are, located, in, its, permafrost, area, as, well, as, 2, 631, km, of, power, lines, and, 580, km, of, railways, there, are, also, 9, 389, km, of, roads, and, around, 30, are, already, sustaining, damage, from, permafrost, thaw, estimates, suggest, that, under, the, scenario, most, similar, to, today, ssp2, 4, 5, around, 60, of, the, current, infrastructure, would, be, at, high, risk, by, 2090, and, simply, maintaining, it, would, cost, 6, 31, billion, with, adaptation, reducing, these, costs, by, 20, 9, at, most, holding, the, global, warming, to, 2, c, 3, 6, f, would, reduce, these, costs, to, 5, 65, billion, and, fulfilling, the, optimistic, paris, agreement, target, of, 1, 5, c, 2, 7, f, would, save, a, further, 1, 32, billion, in, particular, fewer, than, 20, of, railways, would, be, at, high, risk, by, 2100, under, 1, 5, c, 2, 7, f, yet, this, increases, to, 60, at, 2, c, 3, 6, f, while, under, ssp5, 8, 5, this, level, of, risk, is, met, by, mid, century, for, much, of, the, 20th, century, it, was, believed, that, permafrost, would, indefinitely, preserve, anything, buried, there, and, this, made, deep, permafrost, areas, popular, locations, for, hazardous, waste, disposal, in, places, like, canada, s, prudhoe, bay, oil, field, procedures, were, developed, documenting, the, appropriate, way, to, inject, waste, beneath, the, permafrost, this, means, that, as, of, 2023, there, are, 4500, industrial, facilities, in, the, arctic, permafrost, areas, which, either, actively, process, or, store, hazardous, chemicals, additionally, there, are, between, 13, 000, and, 20, 000, sites, which, have, been, heavily, contaminated, 70, of, them, in, russia, and, their, pollution, is, currently, trapped, in, the, permafrost, about, a, fifth, of, both, the, industrial, and, the, polluted, sites, 1000, and, 2200, 4800, are, expected, to, start, thawing, in, the, future, even, if, the, warming, does, not, increase, from, its, 2020, levels, only, about, 3, more, sites, would, start, thawing, between, now, and, 2050, under, the, climate, change, scenario, consistent, with, the, paris, agreement, goals, rcp2, 6, but, by, 2100, about, 1100, more, industrial, facilities, and, 3500, to, 5200, contaminated, sites, are, expected, to, start, thawing, even, then, under, the, very, high, emission, scenario, rcp8, 5, 46, of, industrial, and, contaminated, sites, would, start, thawing, by, 2050, and, virtually, all, of, them, would, be, affected, by, the, thaw, by, 2100, organochlorines, and, other, persistent, organic, pollutants, are, of, a, particular, concern, due, to, their, potential, to, repeatedly, reach, local, communities, after, their, re, release, through, biomagnification, in, fish, at, worst, future, generations, born, in, the, arctic, would, enter, life, with, weakened, immune, systems, due, to, pollutants, accumulating, across, generations, a, notable, example, of, pollution, risks, associated, with, permafrost, was, the, 2020, norilsk, oil, spill, caused, by, the, collapse, of, diesel, fuel, storage, tank, at, norilsk, taimyr, energy, s, thermal, power, plant, no, 3, it, spilled, 6, 000, tonnes, of, fuel, into, the, land, and, 15, 000, into, the, water, polluting, ambarnaya, daldykan, and, many, smaller, rivers, on, taimyr, peninsula, even, reaching, lake, pyasino, which, is, a, crucial, water, source, in, the, area, state, of, emergency, at, the, federal, level, was, declared, the, event, has, been, described, as, the, second, largest, oil, spill, in, modern, russian, history, another, issue, associated, with, permafrost, thaw, is, the, release, of, natural, mercury, deposits, an, estimated, 800, 000, tons, of, mercury, are, frozen, in, the, permafrost, soil, according, to, observations, around, 70, of, it, is, simply, taken, up, by, vegetation, after, the, thaw, however, if, the, warming, continues, under, rcp8, 5, then, permafrost, emissions, of, mercury, into, the, atmosphere, would, match, the, current, global, emissions, from, all, human, activities, by, 2200, mercury, rich, soils, also, pose, a, much, greater, threat, to, humans, and, the, environment, if, they, thaw, near, rivers, under, rcp8, 5, enough, mercury, will, enter, the, yukon, river, basin, by, 2050, to, make, its, fish, unsafe, to, eat, under, the, epa, guidelines, by, 2100, mercury, concentrations, in, the, river, will, double, contrastingly, even, if, mitigation, is, limited, to, rcp4, 5, scenario, mercury, levels, will, increase, by, about, 14, by, 2100, and, will, not, breach, the, epa, guidelines, even, by, 2300, bacteria, are, known, for, being, able, to, remain, dormant, to, survive, adverse, conditions, and, viruses, are, not, metabolically, active, outside, of, host, cells, in, the, first, place, this, has, motivated, concerns, that, permafrost, thaw, could, free, previously, unknown, microorganisms, which, may, be, capable, of, infecting, either, humans, or, important, livestock, and, crops, potentially, resulting, in, damaging, epidemics, or, pandemics, further, some, scientists, argue, that, horizontal, gene, transfer, could, occur, between, the, older, formerly, frozen, bacteria, and, modern, ones, and, one, outcome, could, be, the, introduction, of, novel, antibiotic, resistance, genes, into, the, genome, of, current, pathogens, exacerbating, what, is, already, expected, to, become, a, difficult, issue, in, the, future, at, the, same, time, notable, pathogens, like, influenza, and, smallpox, appear, unable, to, survive, being, thawed, and, other, scientists, argue, that, the, risk, of, ancient, microorganisms, being, both, able, to, survive, the, thaw, and, to, threaten, humans, is, not, scientifically, plausible, likewise, some, research, suggests, that, antimicrobial, resistance, capabilities, of, ancient, bacteria, would, be, comparable, to, or, even, inferior, to, modern, ones, in, 2012, russian, researchers, proved, that, permafrost, can, serve, as, a, natural, repository, for, ancient, life, forms, by, reviving, a, sample, of, silene, stenophylla, from, 30, 000, year, old, tissue, found, in, an, ice, age, squirrel, burrow, in, the, siberian, permafrost, this, is, the, oldest, plant, tissue, ever, revived, the, resultant, plant, was, fertile, producing, white, flowers, and, viable, seeds, the, study, demonstrated, that, living, tissue, can, survive, ice, preservation, for, tens, of, thousands, of, years, between, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, and, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, most, of, the, literature, on, basic, permafrost, science, and, the, engineering, aspects, of, permafrost, was, written, in, russian, one, of, the, earliest, written, reports, describing, the, existence, of, permafrost, dates, to, 1684, when, well, excavation, efforts, in, yakutsk, were, stumped, by, its, presence, 25, a, significant, role, in, the, initial, permafrost, research, was, played, by, alexander, von, middendorff, 1815, 1894, and, karl, ernst, von, baer, a, baltic, german, scientist, at, the, university, of, k, nigsberg, and, a, member, of, the, st, petersburg, academy, of, sciences, baer, began, publishing, works, on, permafrost, in, 1838, and, is, often, considered, the, founder, of, scientific, permafrost, research, baer, laid, the, foundation, for, modern, permafrost, terminology, by, compiling, and, analyzing, all, available, data, on, ground, ice, and, permafrost, baer, is, also, known, to, have, composed, the, world, s, first, permafrost, textbook, in, 1843, materials, for, the, study, of, the, perennial, ground, ice, written, in, his, native, language, however, it, was, not, printed, then, and, a, russian, translation, wasn, t, ready, until, 1942, the, original, german, textbook, was, believed, to, be, lost, until, the, typescript, from, 1843, was, discovered, in, the, library, archives, of, the, university, of, giessen, the, 234, page, text, was, available, online, with, additional, maps, preface, and, comments, notably, baer, s, southern, limit, of, permafrost, in, eurasia, drawn, in, 1843, corresponds, well, with, the, actual, southern, limit, verified, by, modern, research, beginning, in, 1942, siemon, william, muller, delved, into, the, relevant, russian, literature, held, by, the, library, of, congress, and, the, u, s, geological, survey, library, so, that, he, was, able, to, furnish, the, government, an, engineering, field, guide, and, a, technical, report, about, permafrost, by, 1943, that, report, coined, the, english, term, as, a, contraction, of, permanently, frozen, ground, in, what, was, considered, a, direct, translation, of, the, russian, term, vechnaia, merzlota, russian, in, 1953, this, translation, was, criticized, by, another, usgs, researcher, inna, poir, as, she, believed, the, term, had, created, unrealistic, expectations, about, its, stability, 3, more, recently, some, researchers, have, argued, that, perpetually, refreezing, would, be, a, more, suitable, translation, the, report, itself, was, classified, as, u, s, army, office, of, the, chief, of, engineers, strategic, engineering, study, no, 62, 1943, until, a, revised, version, was, released, in, 1947, which, is, regarded, as, the, first, north, american, treatise, on, the, subject, between, 11, and, 15, november, 1963, the, first, international, conference, on, permafrost, took, place, on, the, grounds, of, purdue, university, in, the, american, town, of, west, lafayette, indiana, it, involved, 285, participants, including, engineers, manufacturers, and, builders, who, attended, alongside, the, researchers, from, a, range, of, countries, argentina, austria, canada, germany, great, britain, japan, norway, poland, sweden, switzerland, the, us, and, the, ussr, this, marked, the, beginning, of,
