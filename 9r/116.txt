canopus, is, the, brightest, star, in, the, southern, constellation, of, carina, and, the, second, brightest, star, in, the, night, sky, it, is, also, designated, carinae, which, is, romanized, transliterated, to, alpha, carinae, with, a, visual, apparent, magnitude, of, 0, 74, it, is, outshone, only, by, sirius, located, around, 310, light, years, from, the, sun, canopus, is, a, bright, giant, of, spectral, type, a9, so, it, is, essentially, white, when, seen, with, the, naked, eye, it, has, a, luminosity, over, 10, 000, times, the, luminosity, of, the, sun, is, eight, times, as, massive, and, has, expanded, to, 71, times, the, sun, s, radius, its, enlarged, photosphere, has, an, effective, temperature, of, around, 7400, k, canopus, is, undergoing, core, helium, burning, and, is, currently, in, the, so, called, blue, loop, phase, of, its, evolution, having, already, passed, through, the, red, giant, branch, after, exhausting, the, hydrogen, in, its, core, canopus, is, a, source, of, x, rays, which, are, likely, being, emitted, from, its, corona, the, prominent, appearance, of, canopus, means, it, has, been, the, subject, of, mythological, lore, among, many, ancient, peoples, its, proper, name, is, generally, considered, to, originate, from, the, mythological, canopus, who, was, a, navigator, for, menelaus, king, of, sparta, the, acronycal, rising, marked, the, date, of, the, ptolemaia, festival, in, egypt, in, ancient, india, it, was, named, agastya, after, the, revered, vedic, sage, for, chinese, astronomers, it, was, known, as, the, old, man, of, the, south, pole, in, islamic, astronomy, it, is, suhail, or, suhayl, a, name, that, is, also, commonly, used, to, imply, rareness, of, appearance, as, the, canopus, infrequently, appeared, to, a, gazer, at, middle, eastern, latitutes, the, name, canopus, is, a, latinisation, of, the, ancient, greek, name, kan, bos, recorded, in, claudius, ptolemy, s, almagest, c, 150, ad, eratosthenes, used, the, same, spelling, hipparchos, wrote, it, as, john, flamsteed, wrote, canobus, as, did, edmond, halley, in, his, 1679, catalogus, stellarum, australium, the, name, has, two, possible, derivations, both, listed, in, richard, hinckley, allen, s, seminal, star, names, their, lore, and, meaning, in, 2016, the, international, astronomical, union, organized, a, working, group, on, star, names, wgsn, to, catalog, and, standardize, proper, names, for, stars, the, wgsn, s, first, bulletin, of, july, 2016, included, a, table, of, the, first, two, batches, of, names, approved, by, the, wgsn, which, included, canopus, for, this, star, canopus, is, now, included, in, the, iau, catalog, of, star, names, canopus, traditionally, marked, the, steering, oar, of, the, ship, argo, navis, german, celestial, cartographer, johann, bayer, gave, it, as, the, brightest, star, in, the, constellation, the, designation, of, argus, latinised, to, alpha, argus, in, 1603, in, 1763, french, astronomer, nicolas, louis, de, lacaille, divided, the, huge, constellation, into, three, smaller, ones, and, hence, canopus, became, carinae, latinised, to, alpha, carinae, it, is, listed, in, the, bright, star, catalogue, as, hr, 2326, the, henry, draper, catalogue, as, hd, 45348, and, the, hipparcos, catalogue, as, hip, 30438, flamsteed, did, not, number, this, southern, star, but, benjamin, apthorp, gould, gave, it, the, number, 7, 7, g, carinae, in, his, uranometria, argentina, an, occasional, name, seen, in, english, is, soheil, or, the, feminine, soheila, in, turkish, is, s, heyl, or, the, feminine, s, heyla, from, the, arabic, name, for, several, bright, stars, suhayl, and, canopus, was, known, as, suhel, s, u, h, l, in, medieval, times, alternative, spellings, include, suhail, souhail, suhilon, suheyl, sohayl, suhayil, shoel, sohil, soheil, sahil, suhayeel, sohayil, sihel, and, sihil, an, alternative, name, was, wazn, weight, or, ha, ar, ground, implying, the, anchor, stone, used, by, ship, rather, than, being, related, to, its, low, position, near, the, horizon, hence, comes, its, name, in, the, alfonsine, tables, suhel, ponderosus, a, latinization, of, al, suhayl, al, wazn, its, greek, name, was, revived, during, the, renaissance, the, arabic, muslim, astronomer, ibn, rushd, went, to, marrakesh, in, morocco, to, observe, the, star, in, 1153, as, it, was, invisible, in, his, native, c, rdoba, al, andalus, he, used, the, different, visibility, in, different, latitudes, to, argue, that, the, earth, is, round, following, aristotle, s, argument, which, held, that, such, an, observation, was, only, possible, if, the, earth, was, a, relatively, small, sphere, english, explorer, robert, hues, brought, canopus, to, the, attention, of, european, observers, in, his, 1592, work, tractatus, de, globis, along, with, achernar, and, alpha, centauri, noting, now, therefore, there, are, but, three, stars, of, the, first, magnitude, that, i, could, perceive, in, all, those, parts, which, are, never, seene, here, in, england, the, first, of, these, is, that, bright, star, in, the, sterne, of, argo, which, they, call, canobus, the, second, is, in, the, end, of, eridanus, the, third, is, in, the, right, foote, of, the, centaure, in, the, southern, hemisphere, canopus, and, sirius, are, both, visible, high, in, the, sky, simultaneously, and, reach, a, meridian, just, 21, min, apart, brighter, than, first, magnitude, canopus, can, be, seen, by, naked, eye, in, the, early, twilight, mostly, visible, in, mid, to, late, summer, in, the, southern, hemisphere, canopus, culminates, at, midnight, on, december, 27, and, at, 9, pm, on, february, 11, when, seen, from, latitudes, south, of, 37, 18, s, canopus, is, a, circumpolar, star, since, canopus, is, so, far, south, in, the, sky, it, never, rises, in, mid, to, far, northern, latitudes, in, theory, the, northern, limit, of, visibility, is, latitude, 37, 18, north, this, is, just, south, of, athens, richmond, virginia, usa, and, san, francisco, and, very, close, to, seville, and, agrigento, it, is, almost, exactly, the, latitude, of, lick, observatory, on, mt, hamilton, california, from, which, it, is, readily, visible, because, of, the, effects, of, elevation, and, atmospheric, refraction, which, add, another, degree, to, its, apparent, altitude, under, ideal, conditions, it, can, be, spotted, as, far, north, as, latitude, 37, 31, from, the, pacific, coast, another, northernmost, record, of, visibility, came, from, mount, nemrut, in, turkey, latitude, 37, 59, it, is, more, easily, visible, in, places, such, as, the, gulf, coast, and, florida, and, the, island, of, crete, greece, where, the, best, season, for, viewing, it, around, 9, p, m, is, during, late, january, and, early, february, canopus, has, a, b, v, color, index, of, 0, 15, where, 0, is, a, blue, white, indicating, it, is, essentially, white, although, it, has, been, described, as, yellow, white, canopus, spectral, type, has, been, given, as, f0, and, the, incrementally, warmer, a9, it, is, less, yellow, than, altair, or, procyon, with, indices, measured, as, 0, 22, and, 0, 42, respectively, some, observers, may, have, perceived, canopus, as, yellow, tinged, because, it, is, low, in, the, sky, and, hence, subject, to, atmospheric, effects, patrick, moore, said, that, it, never, appeared, anything, but, white, to, him, the, bolometric, correction, for, canopus, is, 0, 00, indicating, that, the, visual, absolute, magnitude, and, bolometric, absolute, magnitude, are, equal, canopus, was, previously, proposed, to, be, a, member, of, the, scorpius, centaurus, association, however, it, is, not, located, near, the, subgroups, of, that, association, and, has, not, been, included, as, a, sco, cen, member, in, kinematic, studies, that, used, hipparcos, astrometric, data, canopus, is, not, thought, to, be, a, member, of, any, nearby, young, stellar, groups, in, 2014, astronomer, eric, mamajek, reported, that, an, extremely, magnetically, active, m, dwarf, having, strong, coronal, x, ray, emission, 1, 16, degrees, south, of, canopus, appears, to, share, a, common, proper, motion, with, canopus, the, projected, separation, of, the, m, dwarf, 2mass, j06234738, 5351131, canopus, b, is, approximately, 1, 9, parsecs, however, despite, this, large, separation, it, is, still, within, the, estimated, tidal, radius, 2, 9, parsecs, for, the, massive, star, canopus, no, star, closer, than, canopus, is, more, luminous, than, it, and, it, has, been, the, brightest, star, in, earth, s, night, sky, during, three, epochs, over, the, past, four, million, years, other, stars, appear, brighter, only, during, relatively, temporary, periods, during, which, they, are, passing, the, solar, system, much, closer, than, canopus, about, 90, 000, years, ago, sirius, moved, close, enough, that, it, became, brighter, than, canopus, and, that, will, remain, so, for, another, 210, 000, years, but, in, 480, 000, years, as, sirius, moves, further, away, and, appears, fainter, canopus, will, once, again, be, the, brightest, and, will, remain, so, for, a, period, of, about, 510, 000, years, the, southeastern, wall, of, the, kaaba, in, mecca, is, aligned, with, the, rising, point, of, canopus, and, is, also, named, jan, b, the, bedouin, people, of, the, negev, and, sinai, knew, canopus, as, suhayl, and, used, it, and, polaris, as, the, two, principal, stars, for, navigation, at, night, because, it, disappears, below, the, horizon, in, those, regions, it, became, associated, with, a, changeable, nature, as, opposed, to, always, visible, polaris, which, was, circumpolar, and, hence, steadfast, the, south, celestial, pole, can, be, approximately, located, using, canopus, and, another, bright, star, achernar, as, the, three, make, an, equilateral, triangle, canopus, sits, on, an, imaginary, line, that, extends, 36, one, way, to, sirius, and, 37, to, the, south, celestial, pole, canopus, s, brightness, and, location, well, off, the, ecliptic, make, it, useful, for, space, navigation, many, spacecraft, carry, a, special, camera, known, as, a, canopus, star, tracker, plus, a, sun, sensor, for, attitude, determination, mariner, 4, used, canopus, for, second, axis, stabilisation, after, locking, on, the, sun, in, 1964, the, first, time, a, star, had, been, used, canopus, was, little, studied, by, western, scientists, before, the, 20th, century, it, was, given, a, spectral, class, of, f, in, 1897, an, early, use, of, this, extension, to, secchi, class, i, applied, to, those, stars, where, the, hydrogen, lines, are, relatively, weak, and, the, calcium, k, line, relatively, strong, it, was, given, as, a, standard, star, of, f0, in, the, henry, draper, catalogue, with, the, spectral, type, f0, described, as, having, hydrogen, lines, half, the, strength, of, an, a0, star, and, the, calcium, k, line, three, times, as, strong, as, h, american, astronomer, jesse, greenstein, was, interested, in, stellar, spectra, and, used, the, newly, built, otto, struve, telescope, at, mcdonald, observatory, to, analyze, the, star, s, spectrum, in, detail, in, a, 1942, paper, he, reported, that, the, spectrum, is, dominated, by, strong, broad, hydrogen, lines, there, are, also, absorption, lines, of, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulphur, iron, and, many, ionised, metals, it, was, studied, in, the, ultraviolet, by, an, early, astronomical, satellite, gemini, xi, in, 1966, the, uv, spectra, were, considered, to, be, consistent, with, an, f0, supergiant, having, a, temperature, of, 6, 900, k, the, accepted, parameters, for, canopus, at, the, time, new, zealand, based, astronomers, john, hearnshaw, and, krishna, desikachary, examined, the, spectrum, in, greater, detail, publishing, their, results, in, 1982, when, luminosity, classes, were, added, to, the, mk, spectral, classification, scheme, canopus, was, assigned, class, iab, indicating, an, intermediate, luminosity, supergiant, this, was, based, on, the, relative, strengths, of, certain, spectral, lines, understood, to, be, sensitive, to, the, luminosity, of, a, star, in, the, bright, star, catalogue, 5th, edition, it, is, given, the, spectral, class, f0ii, the, luminosity, class, indicating, a, bright, giant, balmer, line, profiles, and, oxygen, line, strengths, indicate, the, size, and, luminosity, of, canopus, when, the, effects, of, stellar, rotation, speed, on, spectral, lines, are, accounted, for, the, mk, spectral, class, of, canopus, is, adjusted, to, a9ii, its, spectrum, consists, mostly, of, absorption, lines, on, a, visible, continuum, but, some, emission, has, been, detected, for, example, the, calcium, k, line, has, weak, emission, wings, on, each, side, of, the, strong, central, absorption, line, first, observed, in, 1966, the, emission, line, profiles, are, usually, correlated, with, the, luminosity, of, the, star, as, described, by, the, wilson, bappu, effect, but, in, the, case, of, canopus, they, indicate, a, luminosity, much, lower, than, that, calculated, by, other, methods, more, detailed, observations, have, shown, that, the, emission, line, profiles, are, variable, and, may, be, due, to, plage, areas, on, the, surface, of, the, star, emission, can, also, be, found, in, other, lines, such, as, the, h, and, k, lines, of, ionised, magnesium, before, the, launch, of, the, hipparcos, satellite, telescope, distance, estimates, for, canopus, varied, widely, from, 96, light, years, to, 1200, light, years, or, 30, to, 370, parsecs, for, example, an, old, distance, estimate, of, 200, parsecs, 652, light, years, gave, it, a, luminosity, of, 80, 000, l, far, higher, than, modern, estimates, the, closer, distance, was, derived, from, parallax, measurements, of, around, 33, mas, the, larger, distance, derives, from, the, assumption, of, a, very, bright, absolute, magnitude, for, canopus, hipparcos, established, canopus, as, being, 310, light, years, 95, parsecs, from, the, solar, system, this, is, based, on, its, 2007, parallax, measurement, of, 10, 43, 0, 53, mas, at, 95, parsecs, the, interstellar, extinction, for, canopus, is, low, at, 0, 26, magnitudes, canopus, is, too, bright, to, be, included, in, the, normal, observation, runs, of, the, gaia, satellite, and, there, is, no, published, gaia, parallax, for, it, at, present, the, star, is, drifting, further, away, from, the, sun, with, a, radial, velocity, of, 20, km, s, some, 3, 1, million, years, ago, it, made, the, closest, approach, to, the, sun, at, a, distance, of, about, 172, ly, 53, pc, canopus, is, orbiting, the, milky, way, with, a, heliocentric, velocity, of, 24, 5, km, s, and, a, low, eccentricity, of, 0, 065, the, absorption, lines, in, the, spectrum, of, canopus, shift, slightly, with, a, period, of, 6, 9, d, this, was, first, detected, in, 1906, and, the, doppler, variations, were, interpreted, as, orbital, motion, an, orbit, was, even, calculated, but, no, such, companion, exists, and, the, small, radial, velocity, changes, are, due, to, movements, in, the, atmosphere, of, the, star, the, maximum, observed, radial, velocities, are, only, 0, 7, to, 1, 6, km, s, canopus, also, has, a, magnetic, field, that, varies, with, the, same, period, detected, by, the, zeeman, splitting, of, its, spectral, lines, canopus, is, bright, at, microwave, wavelengths, one, of, the, few, f, class, stars, to, be, detected, by, radio, the, rotation, period, of, the, star, is, not, accurately, known, but, may, be, over, three, hundred, days, the, projected, rotational, velocity, has, been, measured, at, 9, km, s, an, early, interferometric, measurement, of, its, angular, diameter, in, 1968, gave, a, limb, darkened, value, of, 6, 86, mas, close, to, the, accepted, modern, value, very, long, baseline, interferometry, has, been, used, to, calculate, canopus, angular, diameter, at, 6, 9, mas, combined, with, distance, calculated, from, its, hipparcos, parallax, this, gives, it, a, radius, of, 71, times, that, of, the, sun, if, it, were, at, the, centre, of, the, solar, system, it, would, extend, 90, of, the, way, to, the, orbit, of, mercury, the, radius, and, temperature, relative, to, the, sun, means, that, it, is, 10, 700, times, more, luminous, than, the, sun, and, its, position, in, the, h, r, diagram, relative, to, theoretical, evolutionary, tracks, means, that, it, is, 8, 0, 0, 3, times, as, massive, as, the, sun, measurements, of, its, shape, find, a, 1, 1, departure, from, spherical, symmetry, canopus, is, a, source, of, x, rays, which, are, probably, produced, by, its, corona, magnetically, heated, to, several, million, kelvin, the, temperature, has, likely, been, stimulated, by, fast, rotation, combined, with, strong, convection, percolating, through, the, star, s, outer, layers, the, soft, x, ray, sub, coronal, x, ray, emission, is, much, weaker, than, the, hard, x, ray, coronal, emission, the, same, behaviour, has, been, measured, in, other, f, class, supergiants, such, as, persei, and, is, now, believed, to, be, a, normal, property, of, such, stars, the, spectrum, of, canopus, indicates, that, it, spent, some, 30, million, years, of, its, existence, as, a, blue, white, main, sequence, star, of, around, 10, solar, masses, before, exhausting, its, core, hydrogen, and, evolving, away, from, the, main, sequence, the, position, of, canopus, in, the, h, r, diagram, indicates, that, it, is, currently, in, the, core, helium, burning, phase, it, is, an, intermediate, mass, star, that, has, left, the, red, giant, branch, before, its, core, became, degenerate, and, is, now, in, a, blue, loop, models, of, stellar, evolution, in, the, blue, loop, phase, show, that, the, length, of, the, blue, loop, is, strongly, affected, by, rotation, and, mixing, effects, inside, the, star, it, is, difficult, to, determine, whether, a, star, is, currently, evolving, towards, hotter, temperature, or, returning, to, cooler, temperatures, since, the, evolutionary, tracks, for, stars, with, different, masses, overlap, during, the, blue, loops, canopus, lies, on, the, warm, side, of, the, instability, strip, and, does, not, pulsate, like, cepheid, variables, of, a, similar, luminosity, however, its, atmosphere, does, appear, to, be, unstable, showing, strong, signs, of, convection, canopus, may, be, massive, enough, to, explode, by, an, iron, core, collapse, supernova, canopus, was, known, to, the, ancient, mesopotamians, and, represented, the, city, of, eridu, in, the, three, stars, each, babylonian, star, catalogues, and, later, mul, apin, around, 1100, bc, canopus, was, called, mul, nun, ki, by, the, babylonians, which, translates, as, star, of, the, city, of, eridu, eridu, was, the, southernmost, and, one, of, the, oldest, sumerian, cities, from, there, is, a, good, view, to, the, south, so, that, about, 6000, years, ago, due, to, the, precession, of, the, earth, s, axis, the, first, rising, of, the, star, canopus, in, mesopotamia, could, be, observed, only, from, there, at, the, southern, meridian, at, midnight, today, the, star, sigma, sagittarii, is, known, by, the, common, name, nunki, canopus, was, not, visible, to, the, mainland, ancient, greeks, and, romans, it, was, however, visible, to, the, ancient, egyptians, hence, aratus, did, not, write, of, the, star, as, it, remained, below, the, horizon, while, eratosthenes, and, ptolemy, observing, from, alexandria, did, calling, it, kan, bos, an, egyptian, priestly, poet, in, the, time, of, thutmose, iii, mentions, the, star, as, karbana, the, star, which, pours, his, light, in, a, glance, of, fire, when, he, disperses, the, morning, dew, under, the, ptolemies, the, star, was, known, as, ptolemaion, greek, and, its, acronychal, rising, marked, the, date, of, the, ptolemaia, festival, which, was, held, every, four, years, from, 262, to, 145, bc, the, greek, astronomer, posidonius, used, observations, of, canopus, to, calculate, quite, accurately, the, earth, s, circumference, around, 90, 120, bc, in, indian, vedic, literature, canopus, is, associated, with, the, sage, agastya, one, of, the, ancient, siddhars, and, rishis, the, others, are, associated, with, the, stars, of, the, big, dipper, to, agastya, the, star, is, said, to, be, the, cleanser, of, waters, and, its, rising, coincides, with, the, calming, of, the, waters, of, the, indian, ocean, canopus, is, described, by, pliny, the, elder, and, gaius, julius, solinus, as, the, largest, brightest, and, only, source, of, starlight, for, navigators, near, tamraparni, island, ancient, sri, lanka, during, many, nights, canopus, was, described, as, shou, xing, the, star, of, longevity, in, the, shiji, records, of, the, grand, historian, completed, in, 94, bc, by, chinese, historian, sima, qian, drawing, on, sources, from, the, warring, states, period, he, noted, it, to, be, the, southern, counterpart, of, sirius, and, wrote, of, a, sanctuary, dedicated, to, it, established, by, emperor, qin, shi, huang, between, 221, and, 210, bc, during, the, han, dynasty, the, star, was, auspicious, its, appearance, in, the, southern, sky, heralding, peace, and, absence, war, from, the, imperial, capital, chang, an, the, star, made, a, low, transit, across, the, southern, sky, indicating, true, south, to, observers, and, was, often, obscured, by, clouds, during, this, time, it, was, also, equated, with, old, man, of, the, south, pole, in, chinese, pinyin, nanji, l, or, n, under, this, name, canopus, appears, albeit, misplaced, northwards, on, the, medieval, chinese, manuscript, the, dunhuang, star, chart, although, it, cannot, be, seen, from, the, chinese, capital, of, chang, an, the, chinese, astronomer, yi, xing, had, journeyed, south, to, chart, canopus, and, other, far, southern, stars, in, 724, ad, its, personification, as, the, old, man, star, was, popularised, in, the, tang, dynasty, where, it, appeared, often, in, poetry, and, memorials, later, still, during, the, ming, dynasty, the, star, was, established, as, one, of, the, three, stars, fu, lo, shou, appearing, frequently, in, art, and, literature, of, the, time, this, symbolism, spread, into, neighbouring, cultures, in, asia, in, japan, canopus, is, known, as, mera, boshi, and, roujin, sei, the, old, man, star, and, in, mongolia, it, was, personified, as, the, white, old, man, although, the, link, was, known, in, tibet, with, names, such, as, genpo, karpo, rgan, po, dkar, po, or, genkar, rgan, dkar, white, old, man, the, symbolism, was, not, popular, instead, canopus, was, more, commonly, named, karma, rishi, derived, from, indian, mythology, tibetans, celebrated, the, star, s, heliacal, rising, with, ritual, bathing, and, associated, it, with, morning, dew, bright, stars, were, important, to, the, ancient, polynesians, for, navigation, between, the, many, islands, and, atolls, of, the, pacific, ocean, low, on, the, horizon, they, acted, as, stellar, compasses, to, assist, mariners, in, charting, courses, to, particular, destinations, canopus, served, as, the, southern, wingtip, of, a, great, bird, constellation, called, manu, with, sirius, as, the, body, and, procyon, the, northern, wingtip, which, divided, the, polynesian, night, sky, into, two, hemispheres, the, hawaiian, people, called, canopus, ke, alii, o, kona, i, ka, lewa, the, chief, of, the, southern, expanse, it, was, one, of, the, stars, used, by, hawai, iloa, and, ki, when, they, traveled, to, the, southern, ocean, the, m, ori, people, of, new, zealand, aotearoa, had, several, names, for, canopus, ariki, high, born, was, known, as, a, solitary, star, that, appeared, in, the, east, prompting, people, to, weep, and,
