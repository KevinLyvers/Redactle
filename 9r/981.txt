power, is, the, amount, of, energy, transferred, or, converted, per, unit, time, in, the, international, system, of, units, the, unit, of, power, is, the, watt, equal, to, one, joule, per, second, power, is, a, scalar, quantity, specifying, power, in, particular, systems, may, require, attention, to, other, quantities, for, example, the, power, involved, in, moving, a, ground, vehicle, is, the, product, of, the, aerodynamic, drag, plus, traction, force, on, the, wheels, and, the, velocity, of, the, vehicle, the, output, power, of, a, motor, is, the, product, of, the, torque, that, the, motor, generates, and, the, angular, velocity, of, its, output, shaft, likewise, the, power, dissipated, in, an, electrical, element, of, a, circuit, is, the, product, of, the, current, flowing, through, the, element, and, of, the, voltage, across, the, element, power, is, the, rate, with, respect, to, time, at, which, work, is, done, it, is, the, time, derivative, of, work, p, d, w, d, t, displaystyle, p, frac, dw, dt, where, p, is, power, w, is, work, and, t, is, time, we, will, now, show, that, the, mechanical, power, generated, by, a, force, f, on, a, body, moving, at, the, velocity, v, can, be, expressed, as, the, product, p, d, w, d, t, f, v, displaystyle, p, frac, dw, dt, mathbf, f, cdot, mathbf, v, if, a, constant, force, f, is, applied, throughout, a, distance, x, the, work, done, is, defined, as, w, f, x, displaystyle, w, mathbf, f, cdot, mathbf, x, in, this, case, power, can, be, written, as, p, d, w, d, t, d, d, t, f, x, f, d, x, d, t, f, v, displaystyle, p, frac, dw, dt, frac, d, dt, left, mathbf, f, cdot, mathbf, x, right, mathbf, f, cdot, frac, d, mathbf, x, dt, mathbf, f, cdot, mathbf, v, if, instead, the, force, is, variable, over, a, three, dimensional, curve, c, then, the, work, is, expressed, in, terms, of, the, line, integral, w, c, f, d, r, t, f, d, r, d, t, d, t, t, f, v, d, t, displaystyle, w, int, c, mathbf, f, cdot, d, mathbf, r, int, delta, t, mathbf, f, cdot, frac, d, mathbf, r, dt, dt, int, delta, t, mathbf, f, cdot, mathbf, v, dt, from, the, fundamental, theorem, of, calculus, we, know, that, p, d, w, d, t, d, d, t, t, f, v, d, t, f, v, displaystyle, p, frac, dw, dt, frac, d, dt, int, delta, t, mathbf, f, cdot, mathbf, v, dt, mathbf, f, cdot, mathbf, v, hence, the, formula, is, valid, for, any, general, situation, in, older, works, power, is, sometimes, called, activity, the, dimension, of, power, is, energy, divided, by, time, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, the, unit, of, power, is, the, watt, w, which, is, equal, to, one, joule, per, second, other, common, and, traditional, measures, are, horsepower, hp, comparing, to, the, power, of, a, horse, one, mechanical, horsepower, equals, about, 745, 7, watts, other, units, of, power, include, ergs, per, second, erg, s, foot, pounds, per, minute, dbm, a, logarithmic, measure, relative, to, a, reference, of, 1, milliwatt, calories, per, hour, btu, per, hour, btu, h, and, tons, of, refrigeration, as, a, simple, example, burning, one, kilogram, of, coal, releases, more, energy, than, detonating, a, kilogram, of, tnt, but, because, the, tnt, reaction, releases, energy, more, quickly, it, delivers, more, power, than, the, coal, if, w, is, the, amount, of, work, performed, during, a, period, of, time, of, duration, t, the, average, power, p, avg, over, that, period, is, given, by, the, formula, p, a, v, g, w, t, displaystyle, p, mathrm, avg, frac, delta, w, delta, t, it, is, the, average, amount, of, work, done, or, energy, converted, per, unit, of, time, average, power, is, often, called, power, when, the, context, makes, it, clear, instantaneous, power, is, the, limiting, value, of, the, average, power, as, the, time, interval, t, approaches, zero, p, lim, t, 0, p, a, v, g, lim, t, 0, w, t, d, w, d, t, displaystyle, p, lim, delta, t, to, 0, p, mathrm, avg, lim, delta, t, to, 0, frac, delta, w, delta, t, frac, dw, dt, when, power, p, is, constant, the, amount, of, work, performed, in, time, period, t, can, be, calculated, as, w, p, t, displaystyle, w, pt, in, the, context, of, energy, conversion, it, is, more, customary, to, use, the, symbol, e, rather, than, w, power, in, mechanical, systems, is, the, combination, of, forces, and, movement, in, particular, power, is, the, product, of, a, force, on, an, object, and, the, object, s, velocity, or, the, product, of, a, torque, on, a, shaft, and, the, shaft, s, angular, velocity, mechanical, power, is, also, described, as, the, time, derivative, of, work, in, mechanics, the, work, done, by, a, force, f, on, an, object, that, travels, along, a, curve, c, is, given, by, the, line, integral, w, c, c, f, v, d, t, c, f, d, x, displaystyle, w, c, int, c, mathbf, f, cdot, mathbf, v, dt, int, c, mathbf, f, cdot, d, mathbf, x, where, x, defines, the, path, c, and, v, is, the, velocity, along, this, path, if, the, force, f, is, derivable, from, a, potential, conservative, then, applying, the, gradient, theorem, and, remembering, that, force, is, the, negative, of, the, gradient, of, the, potential, energy, yields, w, c, u, a, u, b, displaystyle, w, c, u, a, u, b, where, a, and, b, are, the, beginning, and, end, of, the, path, along, which, the, work, was, done, the, power, at, any, point, along, the, curve, c, is, the, time, derivative, p, t, d, w, d,

output, power, this, provides, a, simple, formula, for, the, mechanical, advantage, of, the, system, let, the, input, power, to, a, device, be, a, force, f, a, acting, on, a, point, that, moves, with,
