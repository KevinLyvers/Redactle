a, hill, is, a, landform, that, extends, above, the, surrounding, terrain, it, often, has, a, distinct, summit, and, is, usually, applied, to, peaks, which, are, above, elevation, compared, to, the, relative, landmass, though, not, as, prominent, as, mountains, hill, comes, in, the, category, of, slope, places, the, distinction, between, a, hill, and, a, mountain, is, unclear, and, largely, subjective, but, a, hill, is, universally, considered, to, be, not, as, tall, or, as, steep, as, a, mountain, geographers, historically, regarded, mountains, as, hills, greater, than, 1, 000, feet, 304, 8, meters, above, sea, level, which, formed, the, basis, of, the, plot, of, the, 1995, film, the, englishman, who, went, up, a, hill, but, came, down, a, mountain, in, contrast, hillwalkers, have, tended, to, regard, mountains, as, peaks, 2, 000, feet, 610, m, above, sea, level, the, oxford, english, dictionary, also, suggests, a, limit, of, 2, 000, feet, 610, m, and, whittow, states, some, authorities, regard, eminences, above, 600, m, 1, 969, ft, as, mountains, those, below, being, referred, to, as, hills, today, a, mountain, is, usually, defined, in, the, uk, and, ireland, as, any, summit, at, least, 2, 000, feet, or, 610, meters, high, while, the, uk, government, s, countryside, and, rights, of, way, act, 2000, defined, mountainous, areas, for, the, purposes, of, open, access, legislation, as, areas, above, 600, meters, 1, 969, feet, some, definitions, include, a, topographical, prominence, requirement, typically, 100, feet, 30, 5, m, or, 500, feet, 152, 4, m, in, practice, mountains, in, scotland, are, frequently, referred, to, as, hills, no, matter, what, their, height, as, reflected, in, names, such, as, the, cuillin, hills, and, the, torridon, hills, in, wales, the, distinction, is, more, a, term, of, land, use, and, appearance, and, has, nothing, to, do, with, height, for, a, while, the, us, defined, a, mountain, as, being, 1, 000, feet, 304, 8, m, or, more, tall, any, similar, landform, lower, than, this, height, was, considered, a, hill, the, united, states, geological, survey, however, has, concluded, that, these, terms, do, not, in, fact, have, technical, definitions, in, the, us, the, great, soviet, encyclopedia, defined, hill, as, an, upland, with, a, relative, height, of, up, to, 200, m, 660, ft, a, hillock, is, a, small, hill, other, words, include, knoll, and, in, scotland, northern, ireland, and, northern, england, its, variant, knowe, artificial, hills, may, be, referred, to, by, a, variety, of, technical, names, including, mound, and, tumulus, hills, may, form, through, geomorphic, phenomena, faulting, erosion, of, larger, landforms, such, as, mountains, and, movement, and, deposition, of, sediment, by, glaciers, notably, moraines, and, drumlins, or, by, erosion, exposing, solid, rock, which, then, weathers, down, into, a, hill, the, rounded, peaks, of, hills, results, from, the, diffusive, movement, of, soil, and, regolith, covering, the, hill, a, process, known, as, downhill, creep, various, names, may, be, used, to, describe, types, of, hills, based, on, appearance, and, method, of, formation, many, such, names, originated, in, one, geographical, region, to, describe, a, type, of, hill, formation, particular, to, that, region, though, the, names, are, often, adopted, by, geologists, and, used, in, a, wider, geographical, context, these, include, many, settlements, were, originally, built, on, hills, either, to, avoid, floods, particularly, if, they, were, near, a, large, body, of, water, for, defense, since, they, offer, a, good, view, of, the, surrounding, land, and, require, would, be, attackers, to, fight, uphill, or, to, avoid, densely, forested, areas, for, example, ancient, rome, was, built, on, seven, hills, helping, to, protect, it, from, invaders, some, settlements, particularly, in, the, middle, east, are, located, on, artificial, hills, consisting, of, debris, particularly, mudbricks, that, has, accumulated, over, many, generations, such, a, location, is, known, as, a, tell, in, northern, europe, many, ancient, monuments, are, sited, in, heaps, some, of, these, are, defensive, structures, such, as, the, hillforts, of, the, iron, age, but, others, appear, to, have, hardly, any, significance, in, britain, many, churches, at, the, tops, of, hills, are, thought, to, have, been, built, on, the, sites, of, earlier, pagan, holy, places, the, washington, national, cathedral, in, washington, d, c, has, followed, this, tradition, and, was, built, on, the, highest, hill, in, that, city, some, cities, hills, are, culturally, significant, in, their, foundation, defense, and, history, in, addition, to, rome, hills, have, played, a, prominent, role, in, the, history, of, san, francisco, with, its, hills, being, central, to, the, city, s, fog, and, civil, engineering, projects, today, famous, as, tourist, attractions, such, as, the, cable, cars, and, lombard, street, hills, provide, important, advantages, to, an, army, that, controls, their, heights, giving, them, an, elevated, view, and, firing, position, and, forcing, an, opposing, army, to, charge, uphill, to, attack, a, fort, or, other, position, they, may, also, conceal, forces, behind, them, allowing, a, force, to, lie, in, wait, on, the, crest, of, a, hill, using, that, crest, for, cover, and, firing, on, unsuspecting, attackers, as, they, broach, the, hilltop, as, a, result, conventional, military, strategies, often, demand, possession, of, high, ground, because, of, their, strategic, and, tactical, values, hills, have, been, the, site, of, many, notable, battles, such, as, the, battle, of, alesia, in, 52, bc, and, the, first, recorded, military,
