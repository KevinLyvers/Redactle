gadolinium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, gd, and, atomic, number, 64, gadolinium, is, a, silvery, white, metal, when, oxidation, is, removed, it, is, a, malleable, and, ductile, rare, earth, element, gadolinium, reacts, with, atmospheric, oxygen, or, moisture, slowly, to, form, a, black, coating, gadolinium, below, its, curie, point, of, 20, c, 68, f, is, ferromagnetic, with, an, attraction, to, a, magnetic, field, higher, than, that, of, nickel, above, this, temperature, it, is, the, most, paramagnetic, element, it, is, found, in, nature, only, in, an, oxidized, form, when, separated, it, usually, has, impurities, of, the, other, rare, earths, because, of, their, similar, chemical, properties, gadolinium, was, discovered, in, 1880, by, jean, charles, de, marignac, who, detected, its, oxide, by, using, spectroscopy, it, is, named, after, the, mineral, gadolinite, one, of, the, minerals, in, which, gadolinium, is, found, itself, named, for, the, finnish, chemist, johan, gadolin, pure, gadolinium, was, first, isolated, by, the, chemist, paul, mile, lecoq, de, boisbaudran, around, 1886, gadolinium, possesses, unusual, metallurgical, properties, to, the, extent, that, as, little, as, 1, of, gadolinium, can, significantly, improve, the, workability, and, resistance, to, oxidation, at, high, temperatures, of, iron, chromium, and, related, metals, gadolinium, as, a, metal, or, a, salt, absorbs, neutrons, and, is, therefore, used, sometimes, for, shielding, in, neutron, radiography, and, in, nuclear, reactors, like, most, of, the, rare, earths, gadolinium, forms, trivalent, ions, with, fluorescent, properties, and, salts, of, gadolinium, iii, are, used, as, phosphors, in, various, applications, gadolinium, iii, ions, in, water, soluble, salts, are, highly, toxic, to, mammals, however, chelated, gadolinium, iii, compounds, prevent, the, gadolinium, iii, from, being, exposed, to, the, organism, and, the, majority, is, excreted, by, healthy, kidneys, before, it, can, deposit, in, tissues, because, of, its, paramagnetic, properties, solutions, of, chelated, organic, gadolinium, complexes, are, used, as, intravenously, administered, gadolinium, based, mri, contrast, agents, in, medical, magnetic, resonance, imaging, gadolinium, is, the, eighth, member, of, the, lanthanide, series, in, the, periodic, table, it, appears, between, the, elements, europium, to, its, left, and, terbium, to, its, right, and, above, the, actinide, curium, it, is, a, silvery, white, malleable, ductile, rare, earth, element, its, 64, electrons, are, arranged, in, the, configuration, of, 4f, 7, 5d, 1, 6s, 2, of, which, the, ten, 4f, 5d, and, 6s, electrons, are, valence, like, most, other, metals, in, the, lanthanide, series, three, electrons, are, usually, available, as, valence, electrons, the, remaining, 4f, electrons, are, too, strongly, bound, this, is, because, the, 4f, orbitals, penetrate, the, most, through, the, inert, xenon, core, of, electrons, to, the, nucleus, followed, by, 5d, and, 6s, and, this, increases, with, higher, ionic, charge, gadolinium, crystallizes, in, the, hexagonal, close, packed, form, at, room, temperature, at, temperatures, above, 1, 235, c, 2, 255, f, it, forms, or, transforms, into, its, form, which, has, a, body, centered, cubic, structure, the, isotope, gadolinium, 157, has, the, highest, thermal, neutron, capture, cross, section, among, any, stable, nuclide, about, 259, 000, barns, only, xenon, 135, has, a, higher, capture, cross, section, about, 2, 0, million, barns, but, this, isotope, is, radioactive, gadolinium, is, believed, to, be, ferromagnetic, at, temperatures, below, 20, c, 68, f, and, is, strongly, paramagnetic, above, this, temperature, in, fact, at, body, temperature, gadolinium, exhibits, the, greatest, paramagnetic, effect, of, any, element, there, is, evidence, that, gadolinium, is, a, helical, antiferromagnetic, rather, than, a, ferromagnetic, below, 20, c, 68, f, gadolinium, demonstrates, a, magnetocaloric, effect, whereby, its, temperature, increases, when, it, enters, a, magnetic, field, and, decreases, when, it, leaves, the, magnetic, field, a, significant, magnetocaloric, effect, is, observed, at, higher, temperatures, up, to, about, 300, kelvins, in, the, compounds, gd, 5, si, 1, x, ge, x, 4, individual, gadolinium, atoms, can, be, isolated, by, encapsulating, them, into, fullerene, molecules, where, they, can, be, visualized, with, a, transmission, electron, microscope, individual, gd, atoms, and, small, gd, clusters, can, be, incorporated, into, carbon, nanotubes, gadolinium, combines, with, most, elements, to, form, gd, iii, derivatives, it, also, combines, with, nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, phosphorus, boron, selenium, silicon, and, arsenic, at, elevated, temperatures, forming, binary, compounds, unlike, the, other, rare, earth, elements, metallic, gadolinium, is, relatively, stable, in, dry, air, however, it, tarnishes, quickly, in, moist, air, forming, a, loosely, adhering, gadolinium, iii, oxide, gd, 2, o, 3, which, spalls, off, exposing, more, surface, to, oxidation, gadolinium, is, a, strong, reducing, agent, which, reduces, oxides, of, several, metals, into, their, elements, gadolinium, is, quite, electropositive, and, reacts, slowly, with, cold, water, and, quite, quickly, with, hot, water, to, form, gadolinium, iii, hydroxide, gd, oh, 3, gadolinium, metal, is, attacked, readily, by, dilute, sulfuric, acid, to, form, solutions, containing, the, colorless, gd, iii, ions, which, exist, as, 3, complexes, in, the, great, majority, of, its, compounds, like, many, rare, earth, metals, gadolinium, adopts, the, oxidation, state, 3, however, gadolinium, can, be, found, on, rare, occasions, in, the, 0, 1, and, 2, oxidation, states, all, four, trihalides, are, known, all, are, white, except, for, the, iodide, which, is, yellow, most, commonly, encountered, of, the, halides, is, gadolinium, iii, chloride, gdcl, 3, the, oxide, dissolves, in, acids, to, give, the, salts, such, as, gadolinium, iii, nitrate, gadolinium, iii, like, most, lanthanide, ions, forms, complexes, with, high, coordination, numbers, this, tendency, is, illustrated, by, the, use, of, the, chelating, agent, dota, an, octa, dentate, ligand, salts, of, are, useful, in, magnetic, resonance, imaging, a, variety, of, related, chelate, complexes, have, been, developed, including, gadodiamide, reduced, gadolinium, compounds, are, known, especially, in, the, solid, state, gadolinium, ii, halides, are, obtained, by, heating, gd, iii, halides, in, presence, of, metallic, gd, in, tantalum, containers, gadolinium, also, forms, the, sesquichloride, gd, 2, cl, 3, which, can, be, further, reduced, to, gdcl, by, annealing, at, 800, c, 1, 470, f, this, gadolinium, i, chloride, forms, platelets, with, layered, graphite, like, structure, naturally, occurring, gadolinium, is, composed, of, six, stable, isotopes, 154, gd, 155, gd, 156, gd, 157, gd, 158, gd, and, 160, gd, and, one, radioisotope, 152, gd, with, the, isotope, 158, gd, being, the, most, abundant, 24, 8, natural, abundance, the, predicted, double,

gadolinium, have, been, observed, with, the, most, stable, being, 152, gd, naturally, occurring, with, a, half, life, of, about, 1, 08, 10, 14, years, and, 150, gd, with, a, half, life, of, 1, 79, 10, 6, years, all, of, the, remaining, radioactive, isotopes, have, half, lives, of, less, than, 75, years, the, majority, of, these, have, half, lives, of, less, than, 25, seconds, gadolinium, isotopes, have, four, metastable, isomers, with, the, most, stable, being, 143m, gd, t, 1, 2, 110, seconds, 145m, gd, t, 1, 2, 85, seconds, and, 141m, gd, t, 1, 2, 24, 5, seconds, the, isotopes, with, atomic,

beta, decay, and, the, primary, products, are, isotopes, of, terbium, gadolinium, is, named, after, the, mineral, gadolinite, gadolinite, was, first, chemically, analyzed, by, the, finnish, chemist, johan, gadolin, in, 1794, in, 1802, german, chemist, martin, klaproth, gave, gadolinite, its, name, in, 1880, the, swiss, chemist, jean, charles, galissard, de, marignac, observed, the, spectroscopic, lines, from, gadolinium, in, samples, of, gadolinite, which, actually, contains, relatively, little, gadolinium, but, enough, to, show, a, spectrum, and, in, the, separate, mineral, cerite, the, latter, mineral, proved, to, contain, far, more, of, the, element, with, the, new, spectral, line, de, marignac, eventually, separated, a, mineral, oxide, from, cerite, which, he, realized, was, the, oxide, of, this, new, element, he, named, the, oxide, gadolinia, because, he, realized, that, gadolinia, was, the, oxide, of, a, new, element, he, is, credited, with, the, discovery, of, gadolinium, the, french, chemist, paul, mile, lecoq, de, boisbaudran, carried, out, the, separation, of, gadolinium, metal, from, gadolinia, in, 1886, gadolinium, is, a, constituent, in, many, minerals, such, as, monazite, and, bastn, site, the, metal, is, too, reactive, to, exist, naturally, paradoxically, as, noted, above, the, mineral, gadolinite, actually, contains, only, traces, of, this, element, the, abundance, in, the, earth, s, crust, is, about, 6, 2, mg, kg, the, main, mining, areas, are, in, china, the, us, brazil, sri, lanka, india, and, australia, with, reserves, expected, to, exceed, one, million, tonnes, world, production, of, pure, gadolinium, is, about, 400, tonnes, per, year, the, only, known, mineral, with, essential, gadolinium, lepersonnite, gd, is, very, rare, gadolinium, is, produced, both, from, monazite, and, bastn, site, gadolinium, metal, is, obtained, from, its, oxide, or, salts, by, heating, it, with, calcium, at, 1, 450, c, 2, 640, f, in, an, argon, atmosphere,

of, organic, gadolinium, complexes, and, gadolinium, compounds, are, used, as, intravenous, contrast, agents, to, enhance, images, in, medical, and, magnetic, resonance, angiography, mra, procedures, magnevist, is, the, most, widespread, example, nanotubes, packed, with, gadolinium, called, gadonanotubes, are, 40, times, more, effective, than, the, usual, gadolinium, contrast, agent, traditional, gadolinium, based, contrast, agents, are, un, targeted, generally, distributing, throughout, the, body, after, injection, but, will, not, readily, cross, the, intact, blood, brain, barrier, brain, tumors, and, other, disorders, that, degrade, the, blood, brain, barrier, allow, these, agents, to, penetrate, into, the, brain, and, facilitate, their, detection, by, contrast, enhanced, mri, similarly, delayed, gadolinium, enhanced, magnetic, resonance, imaging, of, cartilage, uses, an, ionic, compound, agent, originally, magnevist, that, is, excluded, from, healthy, cartilage, based, on, electrostatic, repulsion, but, will, enter, proteoglycan, depleted, cartilage, in, diseases, such, as, osteoarthritis, gadolinium, is, used, as, a, phosphor, in, medical, imaging, it, is, contained, in, the, phosphor, layer, of, x, ray, detectors, suspended, in, a, polymer, matrix, terbium, doped, gadolinium, oxysulfide, gd, 2, o, 2, s, tb, at, the, phosphor, layer, converts, the, x, rays, released, from, the, source, into, light, this, material, emits, green, light, at, 540, nm, because, of, the, presence, of, tb, 3, which, is, very, useful, for, enhancing, the, imaging, quality, the, energy, conversion, of, gd, is, up, to, 20, which, means, that, one, fifth, of, the, x, ray, energy, striking, the, phosphor, layer, can, be, converted, into, visible, photons, gadolinium, oxyorthosilicate, gd, 2, sio, 5, gso, usually, doped, by, 0, 1, 1, 0, of, ce, is, a, single, crystal, that, is, used, as, a, scintillator, in, medical, imaging, such, as, positron, emission, tomography, and, for, detecting, neutrons, gadolinium, compounds, were, also, used, for, making, green, phosphors, for, color, tv, tubes, gadolinium, 153, is, produced, in, a, nuclear, reactor, from,

gadolinium, is, used, for, making, gadolinium, yttrium, garnet, gd, y, 3, al, 5, o, 12, which, has, microwave, applications, and, is, used, in, fabrication, of, various, optical, components, and, as, substrate, material, for, magneto, optical, films, gadolinium, can, also, serve, as, an, electrolyte, in, solid, oxide, fuel, cells, sofcs, using, gadolinium, as, a, dopant, for, materials, like, cerium, oxide, in, the, form, of, gadolinium, doped, ceria, gives, an, electrolyte, having, both, high, ionic, conductivity, and, low, operating, temperatures, research, is, being, conducted, on, magnetic, refrigeration, near, room, temperature, which, could, provide, significant, efficiency, and, environmental, advantages, over, conventional, refrigeration, methods, gadolinium, based, materials, such, as, gd, 5, si, x, ge, 1, x, 4, are, currently, the, most, promising, materials, owing, to, their, high, curie, temperature, and, giant, magnetocaloric, effect, pure, gd, itself, exhibits, a, large, magnetocaloric, effect, near, its, curie, temperature, of, 20, c, 68, f, and, this, has, sparked, interest, into, producing, gd, alloys, having, a, larger, effect, and, tunable, curie, temperature, in, gd, 5, si, x, ge, 1, x, 4, si, and, ge, compositions, can, be, varied, to, adjust, the, curie, temperature, gadolinium, barium, copper, oxide, gdbco, is, a, superconductor, with, applications, in, superconducting, motors, or, generators, such, as, in, wind, turbines, it, can, be, manufactured, in, the, same, way, as, the, most, widely, researched, cuprate, high, temperature, superconductor, yttrium, barium, copper, oxide, ybco, and, uses, an, analogous, chemical, composition, gdba, 2, cu, 3, o, 7, it, was, used, in, 2014, to, set, a, new, world, record, for, the, highest, trapped, magnetic, field, in, a, bulk, high, temperature, superconductor, with, a, field, of, 17, 6t, being, trapped, within, two, gdbco, bulks, gadolinium, is, being, investigated, as, a, possible, treatment, for, preventing, lung, tissue, scarring, in, asthma, a, positive, effect, has, been, observed, in, mice, gadolinium, is, used, for, antineutrino, detection, in, the, japanese, super, kamiokande, detector, in, order, to, sense, supernova, explosions, low, energy, neutrons, that, arise, from, antineutrino, absorption, by, protons, in, the, detector, s, ultrapure, water, are, captured, by, gadolinium, nuclei, which, subsequently, emit, gamma, rays, that, are, detected, as, part, of, the, antineutrino, signature, gadolinium, gallium, garnet, ggg, gd, 3, ga, 5, o, 12, was, used, for, imitation, diamonds, and, for, computer, bubble, memory, as, a, free, ion, gadolinium, is, reported, often, to, be, highly, toxic, but, mri, contrast, agents, are, chelated, compounds, and, are, considered, safe, enough, to, be, used, in, most, persons, the, toxicity, of, free, gadolinium, ions, in, animals, is, due, to, interference, with, a, number, of, calcium, ion, channel, dependent, processes, the, 50, lethal, dose, is, about, 0, 34, mmol, kg, iv, mouse, or, 100, 200, mg, kg, toxicity, studies, in, rodents, show, that, chelation, of, gadolinium, which, also, improves, its, solubility, decreases, its, toxicity, with, regard, to, the, free, ion, by, a, factor, of, 31, i, e, the, lethal, dose, for, the, gd, chelate, increases, by, 31, times, it, is, believed, therefore, that, clinical, toxicity, of, gadolinium, based, contrast, agents, gbcas, in, humans, will, depend, on, the, strength, of, the, chelating, agent, however, this, research, is, still, not, complete, about, a, dozen, different, gd, chelated, agents, have, been, approved, as, mri, contrast, agents, around, the, world, use, of, gadolinium, based, contrast, agents, results, in, deposition, of, gadolinium, in, tissues, of, the, brain, bone, skin, and, other, tissues, in, amounts, that, depend, on, kidney, function, structure, of, the, chelates, linear, or, macrocyclic, and, the, dose, administered, in, patients, with, kidney, failure, there, is, a, risk, of, a, rare, but, serious, illness, called, nephrogenic, systemic, fibrosis, nsf, that, is, caused, by, the, use, of, gadolinium, based, contrast, agents, the, disease, resembles, scleromyxedema, and, to, some, extent, scleroderma, it, may, occur, months, after, a, contrast, agent, has, been, injected, its, association, with, gadolinium, and, not, the, carrier, molecule, is, confirmed, by, its, occurrence, with, various, contrast, materials, in, which, gadolinium, is, carried, by, very, different, carrier, molecules, because, of, the, risk, of, nsf, use, of, these, agents, is, not, recommended, for, any, individual, with, end, stage, kidney, failure, as, they, may, require, emergent, dialysis, included, in, the, current, guidelines, from, the, canadian, association, of, radiologists, are, that, dialysis, patients, should, receive, gadolinium, agents, only, where, essential, and, that, they, should, receive, dialysis, after, the, exam, if, a, contrast, enhanced, mri, must, be, performed, on, a, dialysis, patient, it, is, recommended, that, certain, high, risk, contrast, agents, be, avoided, but, not, that, a, lower, dose, be, considered, the, american, college, of, radiology, recommends, that, contrast, enhanced, mri, examinations, be, performed, as, closely, before, dialysis, as, possible, as, a, precautionary, measure, although, this, has, not, been, proven, to, reduce, the, likelihood, of, developing, nsf, the, fda, recommends, that, potential, for, gadolinium, retention, be, considered, when, choosing, the, type, of, gbca, used, in, patients, requiring, multiple, lifetime, doses, pregnant, women, children, and, patients, with, inflammatory, conditions, anaphylactoid, reactions, are, rare, occurring, in, approximately, 0, 03, 0, 1, long, term, environmental, impacts, of, gadolinium, contamination, due, to, human, usage, are, a, topic, of, ongoing, research, gadolinium, has, no, known, native, biological, role, but, its, compounds, are, used, as, research, tools, in, biomedicine, gd, 3, compounds, are, components, of, mri, contrast, agents, it, is, used, in, various, ion, channel, electrophysiology, experiments, to, block, sodium, leak, channels, and, stretch, activated, ion, channels, gadolinium, has, recently, been, used, to, measure, the, distance, between, two, points, in, a, protein, via, electron, paramagnetic, resonance, something, that, gadolinium, is, especially, amenable, to, thanks, to, epr, sensitivity, at, w, band, 95, ghz, frequencies
