the, equatorial, coordinate, system, is, a, celestial, coordinate, system, widely, used, to, specify, the, positions, of, celestial, objects, it, may, be, implemented, in, spherical, or, rectangular, coordinates, both, defined, by, an, origin, at, the, centre, of, earth, a, fundamental, plane, consisting, of, the, projection, of, earth, s, equator, onto, the, celestial, sphere, forming, the, celestial, equator, a, primary, direction, towards, the, march, equinox, and, a, right, handed, convention, the, origin, at, the, centre, of, earth, means, the, coordinates, are, geocentric, that, is, as, seen, from, the, centre, of, earth, as, if, it, were, transparent, the, fundamental, plane, and, the, primary, direction, mean, that, the, coordinate, system, while, aligned, with, earth, s, equator, and, pole, does, not, rotate, with, the, earth, but, remains, relatively, fixed, against, the, background, stars, a, right, handed, convention, means, that, coordinates, increase, northward, from, and, eastward, around, the, fundamental, plane, this, description, of, the, orientation, of, the, reference, frame, is, somewhat, simplified, the, orientation, is, not, quite, fixed, a, slow, motion, of, earth, s, axis, precession, causes, a, slow, continuous, turning, of, the, coordinate, system, westward, about, the, poles, of, the, ecliptic, completing, one, circuit, in, about, 26, 000, years, superimposed, on, this, is, a, smaller, motion, of, the, ecliptic, and, a, small, oscillation, of, the, earth, s, axis, nutation, in, order, to, fix, the, exact, primary, direction, these, motions, necessitate, the, specification, of, the, equinox, of, a, particular, date, known, as, an, epoch, when, giving, a, position, the, three, most, commonly, used, are, a, position, in, the, equatorial, coordinate, system, is, thus, typically, specified, true, equinox, and, equator, of, date, mean, equinox, and, equator, of, j2000, 0, or, similar, note, that, there, is, no, mean, ecliptic, as, the, ecliptic, is, not, subject, to, small, periodic, oscillations, a, star, s, spherical, coordinates, are, often, expressed, as, a, pair, right, ascension, and, declination, without, a, distance, coordinate, the, direction, of, sufficiently, distant, objects, is, the, same, for, all, observers, and, it, is, convenient, to, specify, this, direction, with, the, same, coordinates, for, all, in, contrast, in, the, horizontal, coordinate, system, a, star, s, position, differs, from, observer, to, observer, based, on, their, positions, on, the, earth, s, surface, and, is, continuously, changing, with, the, earth, s, rotation, telescopes, equipped, with, equatorial, mounts, and, setting, circles, employ, the, equatorial, coordinate, system, to, find, objects, setting, circles, in, conjunction, with, a, star, chart, or, ephemeris, allow, the, telescope, to, be, easily, pointed, at, known, objects, on, the, celestial, sphere, the, declination, symbol, lower, case, delta, abbreviated, dec, measures, the, angular, distance, of, an, object, perpendicular, to, the, celestial, equator, positive, to, the, north, negative, to, the, south, for, example, the, north, celestial, pole, has, a, declination, of, 90, the, origin, for, declination, is, the, celestial, equator, which, is, the, projection, of, the, earth, s, equator, onto, the, celestial, sphere, declination, is, analogous, to, terrestrial, latitude, the, right, ascension, symbol, lower, case, alpha, abbreviated, ra, measures, the, angular, distance, of, an, object, eastward, along, the, celestial, equator, from, the, march, equinox, to, the, hour, circle, passing, through, the, object, the, march, equinox, point, is, one, of, the, two, points, where, the, ecliptic, intersects, the, celestial, equator, right, ascension, is, usually, measured, in, sidereal, hours, minutes, and, seconds, instead, of, degrees, a, result, of, the, method, of, measuring, right, ascensions, by, timing, the, passage, of, objects, across, the, meridian, as, the, earth, rotates, there, are, 360, 24, h, 15, in, one, hour, of, right, ascension, and, 24, h, of, right, ascension, around, the, entire, celestial, equator, when, used, together, right, ascension, and, declination, are, usually, abbreviated, ra, dec, alternatively, to, right, ascension, hour, angle, abbreviated, ha, or, lha, local, hour, angle, a, left, handed, system, measures, the, angular, distance, of, an, object, westward, along, the, celestial, equator, from, the, observer, s, meridian, to, the, hour, circle, passing, through, the, object, unlike, right, ascension, hour, angle, is, always, increasing, with, the, rotation, of, earth, hour, angle, may, be, considered, a, means, of, measuring, the, time, since, upper, culmination, the, moment, when, an, object, contacts, the, meridian, overhead, a, culminating, star, on, the, observer, s, meridian, is, said, to, have, a, zero, hour, angle, 0, h, one, sidereal, hour, approximately, 0, 9973, solar, hours, later, earth, s, rotation, will, carry, the, star, to, the, west, of, the, meridian, and, its, hour, angle, will, be, 1, h, when, calculating, topocentric, phenomena, right, ascension, may, be, converted, into, hour, angle, as, an, intermediate, step, there, are, a, number, of, rectangular, variants, of, equatorial, coordinates, all, have, the, reference, frames, do, not, rotate, with, the, earth, in, contrast, to, earth, centred, earth, fixed, frames, remaining, always, directed, toward, the, equinox, and, drifting, over, time, with, the, motions, of, precession, and, nutation, in, astronomy, there, is, also, a, heliocentric, rectangular, variant, of, equatorial, coordinates, designated, x, y, z, which, has, this, frame, is, in, every, way, equivalent, to, the, frame, above, except, that, the, origin, is, removed, to, the, centre, of, the, sun, it, is, commonly, used, in, planetary, orbit, calculation, the, three, astronomical, rectangular, coordinate, systems, are, related, by, x, x, y, y, z, z, displaystyle, begin, aligned, xi, x, x, eta, y, y, zeta, z, z, end, aligned
