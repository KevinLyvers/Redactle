an, inorganic, compound, is, typically, a, chemical, compound, that, lacks, carbon, hydrogen, bonds, that, is, a, compound, that, is, not, an, organic, compound, the, study, of, inorganic, compounds, is, a, subfield, of, chemistry, known, as, inorganic, chemistry, inorganic, compounds, comprise, most, of, the, earth, s, crust, although, the, compositions, of, the, deep, mantle, remain, active, areas, of, investigation, all, allotropes, structurally, different, pure, forms, of, an, element, and, some, simple, carbon, compounds, are, often, considered, inorganic, examples, include, the, allotropes, of, carbon, graphite, diamond, buckminsterfullerene, graphene, etc, carbon, monoxide, co, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, carbides, and, salts, of, inorganic, anions, such, as, carbonates, cyanides, cyanates, thiocyanates, isothiocyanates, etc, many, of, these, are, normal, parts, of, mostly, organic, systems, including, organisms, describing, a, chemical, as, inorganic, does, not, necessarily, mean, that, it, cannot, occur, within, living, things, friedrich, w, hler, s, conversion, of, ammonium, cyanate, into, urea, in, 1828, is, often, cited, as, the, starting, point, of, modern, organic, chemistry, in, w, hler, s, era, there, was, widespread, belief, that, organic, compounds, were, characterized, by, a, vital, spirit, in, the, absence, of, vitalism, the, distinction, between, inorganic, and, organic, chemistry, is, merely, semantic
