the, jurassic, d, r, s, k, juurr, ass, ik, is, a, geologic, period, and, stratigraphic, system, that, spanned, from, the, end, of, the, triassic, period, 201, 4, million, years, ago, mya, to, the, beginning, of, the, cretaceous, period, approximately, 145, mya, the, jurassic, constitutes, the, middle, period, of, the, mesozoic, era, and, is, named, after, the, jura, mountains, where, limestone, strata, from, the, period, were, first, identified, the, start, of, the, jurassic, was, marked, by, the, major, triassic, jurassic, extinction, event, associated, with, the, eruption, of, the, central, atlantic, magmatic, province, camp, the, beginning, of, the, toarcian, stage, started, around, 183, million, years, ago, and, is, marked, by, the, toarcian, oceanic, anoxic, event, a, global, episode, of, oceanic, anoxia, ocean, acidification, and, elevated, global, temperatures, associated, with, extinctions, likely, caused, by, the, eruption, of, the, karoo, ferrar, large, igneous, provinces, the, end, of, the, jurassic, however, has, no, clear, definitive, boundary, with, the, cretaceous, and, is, the, only, boundary, between, geological, periods, to, remain, formally, undefined, by, the, beginning, of, the, jurassic, the, supercontinent, pangaea, had, begun, rifting, into, two, landmasses, laurasia, to, the, north, and, gondwana, to, the, south, the, climate, of, the, jurassic, was, warmer, than, the, present, and, there, were, no, ice, caps, forests, grew, close, to, the, poles, with, large, arid, expanses, in, the, lower, latitudes, on, land, the, fauna, transitioned, from, the, triassic, fauna, dominated, jointly, by, dinosauromorph, and, pseudosuchian, archosaurs, to, one, dominated, by, dinosaurs, alone, the, first, birds, appeared, during, the, jurassic, evolving, from, a, branch, of, theropod, dinosaurs, other, major, events, include, the, appearance, of, the, earliest, crabs, and, modern, lizards, and, the, diversification, of, early, mammals, crocodylomorphs, made, the, transition, from, a, terrestrial, to, an, aquatic, life, the, oceans, were, inhabited, by, marine, reptiles, such, as, ichthyosaurs, and, plesiosaurs, while, pterosaurs, were, the, dominant, flying, vertebrates, modern, sharks, and, rays, first, appeared, and, diversified, during, the, period, the, flora, was, dominated, by, ferns, and, gymnosperms, including, conifers, of, which, many, modern, groups, made, their, first, appearance, during, the, period, as, well, as, other, groups, like, the, extinct, bennettitales, the, chronostratigraphic, term, jurassic, is, linked, to, the, jura, mountains, a, forested, mountain, range, that, mainly, follows, the, france, switzerland, border, the, name, jura, is, derived, from, the, celtic, root, jor, via, gaulish, iuris, wooded, mountain, which, was, borrowed, into, latin, as, a, name, of, a, place, and, evolved, into, juria, and, finally, jura, during, a, tour, of, the, region, in, 1795, german, naturalist, alexander, von, humboldt, recognized, carbonate, deposits, within, the, jura, mountains, as, geologically, distinct, from, the, triassic, aged, muschelkalk, of, southern, germany, but, he, erroneously, concluded, that, they, were, older, he, then, named, them, jura, kalkstein, jura, limestone, in, 1799, in, 1829, the, french, naturalist, alexandre, brongniart, published, a, book, entitled, description, of, the, terrains, that, constitute, the, crust, of, the, earth, or, essay, on, the, structure, of, the, known, lands, of, the, earth, in, this, book, brongniart, used, the, phrase, terrains, jurassiques, when, correlating, the, jura, kalkstein, of, humboldt, with, similarly, aged, oolitic, limestones, in, britain, thus, coining, and, publishing, the, term, jurassic, the, german, geologist, leopold, von, buch, in, 1839, established, the, three, fold, division, of, the, jurassic, originally, named, from, oldest, to, the, youngest, the, black, jurassic, brown, jurassic, and, white, jurassic, the, term, lias, had, previously, been, used, for, strata, of, equivalent, age, to, the, black, jurassic, in, england, by, william, conybeare, and, william, phillips, in, 1822, william, phillips, the, geologist, worked, with, william, conybeare, to, find, out, more, about, the, black, jurassic, in, england, the, french, palaeontologist, alcide, d, orbigny, in, papers, between, 1842, and, 1852, divided, the, jurassic, into, ten, stages, based, on, ammonite, and, other, fossil, assemblages, in, england, and, france, of, which, seven, are, still, used, but, none, has, retained, its, original, definition, the, german, geologist, and, palaeontologist, friedrich, august, von, quenstedt, in, 1858, divided, the, three, series, of, von, buch, in, the, swabian, jura, into, six, subdivisions, defined, by, ammonites, and, other, fossils, the, german, palaeontologist, albert, oppel, in, his, studies, between, 1856, and, 1858, altered, d, orbigny, s, original, scheme, and, further, subdivided, the, stages, into, biostratigraphic, zones, based, primarily, on, ammonites, most, of, the, modern, stages, of, the, jurassic, were, formalized, at, the, colloque, du, jurassique, luxembourg, in, 1962, the, jurassic, period, is, divided, into, three, epochs, early, middle, and, late, similarly, in, stratigraphy, the, jurassic, is, divided, into, the, lower, jurassic, middle, jurassic, and, upper, jurassic, series, geologists, divide, the, rocks, of, the, jurassic, into, a, stratigraphic, set, of, units, called, stages, each, formed, during, corresponding, time, intervals, called, ages, stages, can, be, defined, globally, or, regionally, for, global, stratigraphic, correlation, the, international, commission, on, stratigraphy, ics, ratify, global, stages, based, on, a, global, boundary, stratotype, section, and, point, gssp, from, a, single, formation, a, stratotype, identifying, the, lower, boundary, of, the, stage, the, ages, of, the, jurassic, from, youngest, to, oldest, are, as, follows, jurassic, stratigraphy, is, primarily, based, on, the, use, of, ammonites, as, index, fossils, the, first, appearance, datum, of, specific, ammonite, taxa, is, used, to, mark, the, beginnings, of, stages, as, well, as, smaller, timespans, within, stages, referred, to, as, ammonite, zones, these, in, turn, are, also, sometimes, subdivided, further, into, subzones, global, stratigraphy, is, based, on, standard, european, ammonite, zones, with, other, regions, being, calibrated, to, the, european, successions, the, oldest, part, of, the, jurassic, period, has, historically, been, referred, to, as, the, lias, or, liassic, roughly, equivalent, in, extent, to, the, early, jurassic, but, also, including, part, of, the, preceding, rhaetian, the, hettangian, stage, was, named, by, swiss, palaeontologist, eug, ne, renevier, in, 1864, after, hettange, grande, in, north, eastern, france, the, gssp, for, the, base, of, the, hettangian, is, located, at, the, kuhjoch, pass, karwendel, mountains, northern, calcareous, alps, austria, it, was, ratified, in, 2010, the, beginning, of, the, hettangian, and, thus, the, jurassic, as, a, whole, is, marked, by, the, first, appearance, of, the, ammonite, psiloceras, spelae, tirolicum, in, the, kendlbach, formation, exposed, at, kuhjoch, the, base, of, the, jurassic, was, previously, defined, as, the, first, appearance, of, psiloceras, planorbis, by, albert, oppel, in, 1856, 58, but, this, was, changed, as, the, appearance, was, seen, as, too, localised, an, event, for, an, international, boundary, the, sinemurian, stage, was, first, defined, and, introduced, into, scientific, literature, by, alcide, d, orbigny, in, 1842, it, takes, its, name, from, the, french, town, of, semur, en, auxois, near, dijon, the, original, definition, of, sinemurian, included, what, is, now, the, hettangian, the, gssp, of, the, sinemurian, is, located, at, a, cliff, face, north, of, the, hamlet, of, east, quantoxhead, 6, kilometres, east, of, watchet, somerset, england, within, the, blue, lias, and, was, ratified, in, 2000, the, beginning, of, the, sinemurian, is, defined, by, the, first, appearance, of, the, ammonite, vermiceras, quantoxense, albert, oppel, in, 1858, named, the, pliensbachian, stage, after, the, hamlet, of, pliensbach, in, the, community, of, zell, unter, aichelberg, in, the, swabian, alb, near, stuttgart, germany, the, gssp, for, the, base, of, the, pliensbachian, is, found, at, the, wine, haven, locality, in, robin, hood, s, bay, yorkshire, england, in, the, redcar, mudstone, formation, and, was, ratified, in, 2005, the, beginning, of, the, pliensbachian, is, defined, by, the, first, appearance, of, the, ammonite, bifericeras, donovani, the, village, thouars, latin, toarcium, just, south, of, saumur, in, the, loire, valley, of, france, lends, its, name, to, the, toarcian, stage, the, toarcian, was, named, by, alcide, d, orbigny, in, 1842, with, the, original, locality, being, vrines, quarry, around, 2, km, northwest, of, thouars, the, gssp, for, the, base, of, the, toarcian, is, located, at, peniche, portugal, and, was, ratified, in, 2014, the, boundary, is, defined, by, the, first, appearance, of, ammonites, belonging, to, the, subgenus, dactylioceras, eodactylites, the, aalenian, is, named, after, the, city, of, aalen, in, germany, the, aalenian, was, defined, by, swiss, geologist, karl, mayer, eymar, in, 1864, the, lower, boundary, was, originally, between, the, dark, clays, of, the, black, jurassic, and, the, overlying, clayey, sandstone, and, ferruginous, oolite, of, the, brown, jurassic, sequences, of, southwestern, germany, the, gssp, for, the, base, of, the, aalenian, is, located, at, fuentelsaz, in, the, iberian, range, near, guadalajara, spain, and, was, ratified, in, 2000, the, base, of, the, aalenian, is, defined, by, the, first, appearance, of, the, ammonite, leioceras, opalinum, alcide, d, orbigny, in, 1842, named, the, bajocian, stage, after, the, town, of, bayeux, latin, bajoce, in, normandy, france, the, gssp, for, the, base, of, the, bajocian, is, located, in, the, murtinheira, section, at, cabo, mondego, portugal, it, was, ratified, in, 1997, the, base, of, the, bajocian, is, defined, by, the, first, appearance, of, the, ammonite, hyperlioceras, mundum, the, bathonian, is, named, after, the, city, of, bath, england, introduced, by, belgian, geologist, d, omalius, d, halloy, in, 1843, after, an, incomplete, section, of, oolitic, limestones, in, several, quarries, in, the, region, the, gssp, for, the, base, of, the, bathonian, is, ravin, du, b, s, bas, auran, area, alpes, de, haute, provence, france, it, was, ratified, in, 2009, the, base, of, the, bathonian, is, defined, by, the, first, appearance, of, the, ammonite, gonolkites, convergens, at, the, base, of, the, zigzagiceras, zigzag, ammonite, zone, the, callovian, is, derived, from, the, latinized, name, of, the, village, of, kellaways, in, wiltshire, england, and, was, named, by, alcide, d, orbigny, in, 1852, originally, the, base, at, the, contact, between, the, forest, marble, formation, and, the, cornbrash, formation, however, this, boundary, was, later, found, to, be, within, the, upper, part, of, the, bathonian, the, base, of, the, callovian, does, not, yet, have, a, certified, gssp, the, working, definition, for, the, base, of, the, callovian, is, the, first, appearance, of, ammonites, belonging, to, the, genus, kepplerites, the, oxfordian, is, named, after, the, city, of, oxford, in, england, and, was, named, by, alcide, d, orbigny, in, 1844, in, reference, to, the, oxford, clay, the, base, of, the, oxfordian, lacks, a, defined, gssp, w, j, arkell, in, studies, in, 1939, and, 1946, placed, the, lower, boundary, of, the, oxfordian, as, the, first, appearance, of, the, ammonite, quenstedtoceras, mariae, then, placed, in, the, genus, vertumniceras, subsequent, proposals, have, suggested, the, first, appearance, of, cardioceras, redcliffense, as, the, lower, boundary, the, village, of, kimmeridge, on, the, coast, of, dorset, england, is, the, origin, of, the, name, of, the, kimmeridgian, the, stage, was, named, by, alcide, d, orbigny, in, 1842, in, reference, to, the, kimmeridge, clay, the, gssp, for, the, base, of, the, kimmeridgian, is, the, flodigarry, section, at, staffin, bay, on, the, isle, of, skye, scotland, which, was, ratified, in, 2021, the, boundary, is, defined, by, the, first, appearance, of, ammonites, marking, the, boreal, bauhini, zone, and, the, subboreal, baylei, zone, the, tithonian, was, introduced, in, scientific, literature, by, albert, oppel, in, 1865, the, name, tithonian, is, unusual, in, geological, stage, names, because, it, is, derived, from, greek, mythology, rather, than, a, place, name, tithonus, was, the, son, of, laomedon, of, troy, and, fell, in, love, with, eos, the, greek, goddess, of, dawn, his, name, was, chosen, by, albert, oppel, for, this, stratigraphical, stage, because, the, tithonian, finds, itself, hand, in, hand, with, the, dawn, of, the, cretaceous, the, base, of, the, tithonian, currently, lacks, a, gssp, the, working, definition, for, the, base, of, the, tithonian, is, the, first, appearance, of, the, ammonite, genus, gravesia, the, upper, boundary, of, the, jurassic, is, currently, undefined, and, the, jurassic, cretaceous, boundary, is, currently, the, only, system, boundary, to, lack, a, defined, gssp, placing, a, gssp, for, this, boundary, has, been, difficult, because, of, the, strong, regionality, of, most, biostratigraphic, markers, and, lack, of, any, chemostratigraphic, events, such, as, isotope, excursions, large, sudden, changes, in, ratios, of, isotopes, that, could, be, used, to, define, or, correlate, a, boundary, calpionellids, an, enigmatic, group, of, planktonic, protists, with, urn, shaped, calcitic, tests, briefly, abundant, during, the, latest, jurassic, to, earliest, cretaceous, have, been, suggested, to, represent, the, most, promising, candidates, for, fixing, the, jurassic, cretaceous, boundary, in, particular, the, first, appearance, calpionella, alpina, co, inciding, with, the, base, of, the, eponymous, alpina, subzone, has, been, proposed, as, the, definition, of, the, base, of, the, cretaceous, the, working, definition, for, the, boundary, has, often, been, placed, as, the, first, appearance, of, the, ammonite, strambergella, jacobi, formerly, placed, in, the, genus, berriasella, but, its, use, as, a, stratigraphic, indicator, has, been, questioned, as, its, first, appearance, does, not, correlate, with, that, of, c, alpina, the, kimmeridge, clay, and, equivalents, are, the, major, source, rock, for, the, north, sea, oil, the, arabian, intrashelf, basin, deposited, during, the, middle, and, late, jurassic, is, the, setting, of, the, world, s, largest, oil, reserves, including, the, ghawar, field, the, world, s, largest, oil, field, the, jurassic, aged, sargelu, and, naokelekan, formations, are, major, source, rocks, for, oil, in, iraq, over, 1500, gigatons, of, jurassic, coal, reserves, are, found, in, north, west, china, primarily, in, the, turpan, hami, basin, and, the, ordos, basin, major, impact, structures, include, the, morokweng, impact, structure, a, 70, km, diameter, impact, structure, buried, beneath, the, kalahari, desert, in, northern, south, africa, the, impact, is, dated, to, the, tithonian, approximately, 146, 06, 0, 16, mya, another, major, structure, is, the, puchezh, katunki, crater, 40, kilometres, in, diameter, buried, beneath, nizhny, novgorod, oblast, in, western, russia, the, impact, has, been, dated, to, the, sinemurian, 195, 9, 1, 0, ma, at, the, beginning, of, the, jurassic, all, of, the, world, s, major, landmasses, were, coalesced, into, the, supercontinent, pangaea, which, during, the, early, jurassic, began, to, break, up, into, northern, supercontinent, laurasia, and, the, southern, supercontinent, gondwana, the, rifting, between, north, america, and, africa, was, the, first, to, initiate, beginning, in, the, early, jurassic, associated, with, the, emplacement, of, the, central, atlantic, magmatic, province, during, the, jurassic, the, north, atlantic, ocean, remained, relatively, narrow, while, the, south, atlantic, did, not, open, until, the, cretaceous, the, continents, were, surrounded, by, panthalassa, with, the, tethys, ocean, between, gondwana, and, asia, at, the, end, of, the, triassic, there, was, a, marine, transgression, in, europe, flooding, most, parts, of, central, and, western, europe, transforming, it, into, an, archipelago, of, islands, surrounded, by, shallow, seas, during, the, jurassic, both, the, north, and, south, pole, were, covered, by, oceans, beginning, in, the, early, jurassic, the, boreal, ocean, was, connected, to, the, proto, atlantic, by, the, viking, corridor, or, transcontinental, laurasian, seaway, a, passage, between, the, baltic, shield, and, greenland, several, hundred, kilometers, wide, during, the, callovian, the, turgai, epicontinental, sea, formed, creating, a, marine, barrier, between, europe, and, asia, madagascar, and, antarctica, began, to, rift, away, from, africa, during, the, late, early, jurassic, in, association, with, the, eruption, of, the, karoo, ferrar, large, igneous, provinces, opening, the, western, indian, ocean, and, beginning, the, fragmentation, of, gondwana, at, the, beginning, of, the, jurassic, north, and, south, america, remained, connected, but, by, the, beginning, of, the, late, jurassic, they, had, rifted, apart, to, form, the, caribbean, seaway, also, known, as, the, hispanic, corridor, which, connected, the, north, atlantic, ocean, with, eastern, panthalassa, palaeontological, data, suggest, that, the, seaway, had, been, open, since, the, early, jurassic, as, part, of, the, nevadan, orogeny, which, began, during, the, triassic, the, cache, creek, ocean, closed, and, various, terranes, including, the, large, wrangellia, terrane, accreted, onto, the, western, margin, of, north, america, by, the, middle, jurassic, the, siberian, plate, and, the, north, china, amuria, block, had, collided, resulting, in, the, closure, of, the, mongol, okhotsk, ocean, during, the, early, jurassic, around, 190, million, years, ago, the, pacific, plate, originated, at, the, triple, junction, of, the, farallon, phoenix, and, izanagi, tectonic, plates, the, three, main, oceanic, plates, of, panthalassa, the, previously, stable, triple, junction, had, converted, to, an, unstable, arrangement, surrounded, on, all, sides, by, transform, faults, because, of, a, kink, in, one, of, the, plate, boundaries, resulting, in, the, formation, of, the, pacific, plate, at, the, centre, of, the, junction, during, the, middle, to, early, late, jurassic, the, sundance, seaway, a, shallow, epicontinental, sea, covered, much, of, northwest, north, america, the, eustatic, sea, level, is, estimated, to, have, been, close, to, present, levels, during, the, hettangian, and, sinemurian, rising, several, tens, of, metres, during, the, late, sinemurian, pliensbachian, before, regressing, to, near, present, levels, by, the, late, pliensbachian, there, seems, to, have, been, a, gradual, rise, to, a, peak, of, 75, m, above, present, sea, level, during, the, toarcian, during, the, latest, part, of, the, toarcian, the, sea, level, again, dropped, by, several, tens, of, metres, it, progressively, rose, from, the, aalenian, onwards, aside, from, dips, of, a, few, tens, of, metres, in, the, bajocian, and, around, the, callovian, oxfordian, boundary, peaking, possibly, as, high, as, 140, metres, above, present, sea, level, at, the, kimmeridgian, tithonian, boundary, the, sea, levels, falls, in, the, late, tithonian, perhaps, to, around, 100, metres, before, rebounding, to, around, 110, metres, at, the, tithonian, berriasian, boundary, the, sea, level, within, the, long, term, trends, across, the, jurassic, was, cyclical, with, 64, fluctuations, 15, of, which, were, over, 75, metres, the, most, noted, cyclicity, in, jurassic, rocks, is, fourth, order, with, a, periodicity, of, approximately, 410, 000, years, during, the, early, jurassic, the, world, s, oceans, transitioned, from, an, aragonite, sea, to, a, calcite, sea, chemistry, favouring, the, dissolution, of, aragonite, and, precipitation, of, calcite, the, rise, of, calcareous, plankton, during, the, middle, jurassic, profoundly, altered, ocean, chemistry, with, the, deposition, of, biomineralized, plankton, on, the, ocean, floor, acting, as, a, buffer, against, large, co, 2, emissions, the, climate, of, the, jurassic, was, generally, warmer, than, that, of, present, by, around, 5, c, 41, f, to, 10, c, 50, f, with, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, likely, about, four, times, higher, intermittent, cold, snap, intervals, are, known, to, have, occurred, during, this, time, period, however, interrupting, the, otherwise, warm, greenhouse, climate, forests, likely, grew, near, the, poles, where, they, experienced, warm, summers, and, cold, sometimes, snowy, winters, there, were, unlikely, to, have, been, ice, sheets, given, the, high, summer, temperatures, that, prevented, the, accumulation, of, snow, though, there, may, have, been, mountain, glaciers, dropstones, and, glendonites, in, northeastern, siberia, during, the, early, to, middle, jurassic, indicate, cold, winters, the, ocean, depths, were, likely, 8, c, 46, f, warmer, than, present, and, coral, reefs, grew, 10, of, latitude, further, north, and, south, the, intertropical, convergence, zone, likely, existed, over, the, oceans, resulting, in, large, areas, of, desert, and, scrubland, in, the, lower, latitudes, between, 40, n, and, s, of, the, equator, tropical, rainforest, and, tundra, biomes, are, likely, to, have, been, rare, or, absent, the, jurassic, also, witnessed, the, decline, of, the, pangaean, megamonsoon, that, had, characterised, the, preceding, permian, and, triassic, periods, variation, in, the, frequency, of, wildfire, activity, in, the, jurassic, was, governed, by, the, 405, kyr, eccentricity, cycle, thanks, to, the, breakup, of, pangaea, the, hydrological, cycle, during, the, jurassic, was, significantly, enhanced, the, beginning, of, the, jurassic, was, likely, marked, by, a, thermal, spike, corresponding, to, the, triassic, jurassic, extinction, and, eruption, of, the, central, atlantic, magmatic, province, the, first, part, of, the, jurassic, was, marked, by, the, early, jurassic, cool, interval, between, 199, and, 183, million, years, ago, it, has, been, proposed, that, glaciation, was, present, in, the, northern, hemisphere, during, both, the, early, pliensbachian, and, the, latest, pliensbachian, there, was, a, spike, in, global, temperatures, of, around, 4, 8, c, 39, 46, f, during, the, early, part, of, the, toarcian, corresponding, to, the, toarcian, oceanic, anoxic, event, and, the, eruption, of, the, karoo, ferrar, large, igneous, provinces, in, southern, gondwana, with, the, warm, interval, extending, to, the, end, of, the, toarcian, around, 174, million, years, ago, during, the, toarcian, warm, interval, ocean, surface, temperatures, likely, exceeded, 30, c, 86, f, and, equatorial, and, subtropical, 30, n, 30, s, regions, are, likely, to, have, been, extremely, arid, with, temperatures, in, the, interior, of, pangea, likely, in, excess, of, 40, c, 104, f, the, toarcian, warm, interval, is, followed, by, the, middle, jurassic, cool, interval, mjci, between, 174, and, 164, million, years, ago, which, may, have, been, punctuated, by, brief, ephemeral, icehouse, intervals, during, the, aalenian, precessionally, forced, climatic, changes, dictated, peatland, wildfire, magnitude, and, frequency, the, european, climate, appears, to, have, become, noticeably, more, humid, at, the, aalenian, bajocian, boundary, but, then, became, more, arid, during, the, middle, bajocian, a, transient, ice, age, possibly, occurred, in, the, late, bajocian, the, callovian, oxfordian, boundary, at, the, end, of, the, mjci, witnessed, particularly, notable, global, cooling, potentially, even, an, ice, age, this, is, followed, by, the, kimmeridgian, warm, interval, kwi, between, 164, and, 150, million, years, ago, based, on, fossil, wood, distribution, this, was, one, of, the, wettest, intervals, of, the, jurassic, the, pangaean, interior, had, less, severe, seasonal, swings, than, in, previous, warm, periods, as, the, expansion, of, the, central, atlantic, and, western, indian, ocean, provided, new,

negative, carbon, isotope, excursion, as, well, as, the, deposition, of, black, shales, and, the, extinction, and, collapse, of, carbonate, producing, marine, organisms, associated, with, a, major, rise, in, global, temperatures, the, toae, is, often, attributed, to, the, eruption, of, the, karoo, ferrar, large, igneous, provinces, and, the, associated, increase, of, carbon, dioxide, concentration, in, the, atmosphere, as, well, as, the, possible, associated, release, of, methane, clathrates, this, likely, accelerated, the, hydrological, cycle, and, increased, silicate,

foraminifera, bivalves, cnidarians, and, especially, brachiopods, for, which, the, toae, represented, one, of, the, most, severe, extinctions, in, their, evolutionary, history, while, the, event, had, significant, impact, on, marine, invertebrates, it, had, little, effect, on, marine, reptiles, during, the, toae, the, sichuan, basin, was, transformed, into, a, giant, lake, probably, three, times,
