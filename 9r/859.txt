gloss, is, an, optical, property, which, indicates, how, well, a, surface, reflects, light, in, a, specular, mirror, like, direction, it, is, one, of, the, important, parameters, that, are, used, to, describe, the, visual, appearance, of, an, object, other, categories, of, visual, appearance, related, to, the, perception, of, regular, or, diffuse, reflection, and, transmission, of, light, have, been, organized, under, the, concept, of, cesia, in, an, order, system, with, three, variables, including, gloss, among, the, involved, aspects, the, factors, that, affect, gloss, are, the, refractive, index, of, the, material, the, angle, of, incident, light, and, the, surface, topography, apparent, gloss, depends, on, the, amount, of, specular, reflection, light, reflected, from, the, surface, in, an, equal, amount, and, the, symmetrical, angle, to, the, one, of, incoming, light, in, comparison, with, diffuse, reflection, the, amount, of, light, scattered, into, other, directions, when, light, illuminates, an, object, it, interacts, with, it, in, a, number, of, ways, variations, in, surface, texture, directly, influence, the, level, of, specular, reflection, objects, with, a, smooth, surface, i, e, highly, polished, or, containing, coatings, with, finely, dispersed, pigments, appear, shiny, to, the, eye, due, to, a, large, amount, of, light, being, reflected, in, a, specular, direction, whilst, rough, surfaces, reflect, no, specular, light, as, the, light, is, scattered, in, other, directions, and, therefore, appears, dull, the, image, forming, qualities, of, these, surfaces, are, much, lower, making, any, reflections, appear, blurred, and, distorted, substrate, material, type, also, influences, the, gloss, of, a, surface, non, metallic, materials, i, e, plastics, etc, produce, a, higher, level, of, reflected, light, when, illuminated, at, a, greater, illumination, angle, due, to, light, being, absorbed, into, the, material, or, being, diffusely, scattered, depending, on, the, colour, of, the, material, metals, do, not, suffer, from, this, effect, producing, higher, amounts, of, reflection, at, any, angle, the, fresnel, formula, gives, the, specular, reflectance, r, s, displaystyle, r, s, for, an, unpolarized, light, of, intensity, i, 0, displaystyle, i, 0, at, angle, of, incidence, i, displaystyle, i, giving, the, intensity, of, specularly, reflected, beam, of, intensity, i, r, displaystyle, i, r, while, the, refractive, index, of, the, surface, specimen, is, m, displaystyle, m, the, fresnel, equation, is, given, as, follows, r, s, i, r, i, 0, displaystyle, r, s, frac, i, r, i, 0, surface, roughness, influences, the, specular, reflectance, levels, in, the, visible, frequencies, the, surface, finish, in, the, micrometre, range, is, most, relevant, the, diagram, on, the, right, depicts, the, reflection, at, an, angle, i, displaystyle, i, on, a, rough, surface, with, a, characteristic, roughness, height, variation, h, displaystyle, delta, h, the, path, difference, between, rays, reflected, from, the, top, and, bottom, of, the, surface, bumps, is, when, the, wavelength, of, the, light, is, displaystyle, lambda, the, phase, difference, will, be, if, displaystyle, delta, phi, is, small, the, two, beams, see, figure, 1, are, nearly, in, phase, resulting, in, constructive, interference, therefore, the, specimen, surface, can, be, considered, smooth, but, when, displaystyle, delta, phi, pi, then, beams, are, not, in, phase, and, through, destructive, interference, cancellation, of, each, other, will, occur, low, intensity, of, specularly, reflected, light, means, the, surface, is, rough, and, it, scatters, the, light, in, other, directions, if, the, middle, phase, value, is, taken, as, criterion, for, smooth, surface, 2, displaystyle, delta, phi, pi, 2, then, substitution, into, the, equation, above, will, produce, this, smooth, surface, condition, is, known, as, the, rayleigh, roughness, criterion, the, earliest, studies, of, gloss, perception, are, attributed, to, ingersoll, who, in, 1914, examined, the, effect, of, gloss, on, paper, by, quantitatively, measuring, gloss, using, instrumentation, ingersoll, based, his, research, around, the, theory, that, light, is, polarised, in, specular, reflection, whereas, diffusely, reflected, light, is, non, polarized, the, ingersoll, glarimeter, had, a, specular, geometry, with, incident, and, viewing, angles, at, 57, 5, using, this, configuration, gloss, was, measured, using, a, contrast, method, which, subtracted, the, specular, component, from, the, total, reflectance, using, a, polarizing, filter, in, the, 1930s, work, by, a, h, pfund, suggested, that, although, specular, shininess, is, the, basic, objective, evidence, of, gloss, actual, surface, glossy, appearance, subjective, relates, to, the, contrast, between, specular, shininess, and, the, diffuse, light, of, the, surrounding, surface, area, now, called, contrast, gloss, or, luster, if, black, and, white, surfaces, of, the, same, shininess, are, visually, compared, the, black, surface, will, always, appear, glossier, because, of, the, greater, contrast, between, the, specular, highlight, and, the, black, surroundings, as, compared, to, that, with, white, surface, and, surroundings, pfund, was, also, the, first, to, suggest, that, more, than, one, method, was, needed, to, analyze, gloss, correctly, in, 1937, hunter, as, part, of, his, research, paper, on, gloss, described, six, different, visual, criteria, attributed, to, apparent, gloss, the, following, diagrams, show, the, relationships, between, an, incident, beam, of, light, i, a, specularly, reflected, beam, s, a, diffusely, reflected, beam, d, and, a, near, specularly, reflected, beam, b, defined, as, the, ratio, of, the, light, reflected, from, a, surface, at, an, equal, but, opposite, angle, to, that, incident, on, the, surface, defined, as, the, gloss, at, grazing, angles, of, incidence, and, viewing, defined, as, the, ratio, of, the, specularly, reflected, light, to, that, diffusely, reflected, normal, to, the, surface, defined, as, a, measure, of, the, absence, of, haze, or, a, milky, appearance, adjacent, to, the, specularly, reflected, light, haze, is, the, inverse, of, absence, of, bloom, defined, as, the, sharpness, of, the, specularly, reflected, light, defined, as, the, uniformity, of, the, surface, in, terms, of, visible, texture, and, defects, orange, peel, scratches, inclusions, etc, a, surface, can, therefore, appear, very, shiny, if, it, has, a, well, defined, specular, reflectance, at, the, specular, angle, the, perception, of, an, image, reflected, in, the, surface, can, be, degraded, by, appearing, unsharp, or, by, appearing, to, be, of, low, contrast, the, former, is, characterised, by, the, measurement, of, the, distinctness, of, image, and, the, latter, by, the, haze, or, contrast, gloss, in, his, paper, hunter, also, noted, the, importance, of, three, main, factors, in, the, measurement, of, gloss, for, his, research, he, used, a, glossmeter, with, a, specular, angle, of, 45, as, did, most, of, the, first, photoelectric, methods, of, that, type, later, studies, however, by, hunter, and, judd, in, 1939, on, a, larger, number, of, painted, samples, concluded, that, the, 60, degree, geometry, was, the, best, angle, to, use, so, as, to, provide, the, closest, correlation, to, a, visual, observation, standardisation, in, gloss, measurement, was, led, by, hunter, and, astm, american, society, for, testing, and, materials, who, produced, astm, d523, standard, test, method, for, specular, gloss, in, 1939, this, incorporated, a, method, for, measuring, gloss, at, a, specular, angle, of, 60, later, editions, of, the, standard, 1951, included, methods, for, measuring, at, 20, for, evaluating, high, gloss, finishes, developed, at, the, dupont, company, horning, and, morse, 1947, and, 85, matte, or, low, gloss, astm, has, a, number, of, other, gloss, related, standards, designed, for, application, in, specific, industries, including, the, old, 45, method, which, is, used, primarily, now, used, for, glazed, ceramics, polyethylene, and, other, plastic, films, in, 1937, the, paper, industry, adopted, a, 75, specular, gloss, method, because, the, angle, gave, the, best, separation, of, coated, book, papers, this, method, was, adopted, in, 1951, by, the, technical, association, of, pulp, and, paper, industries, as, tappi, method, t480, in, the, paint, industry, measurements, of, the, specular, gloss, are, made, according, to, international, standard, iso, 2813, bs, 3900, part, 5, uk, din, 67530, germany, nft, 30, 064, france, as, 1580, australia, jis, z8741, japan, are, also, equivalent, this, standard, is, essentially, the, same, as, astm, d523, although, differently, drafted, studies, of, polished, metal, surfaces, and, anodised, aluminium, automotive, trim, in, the, 1960s, by, tingle, potter, and, george, led, to, the, standardisation, of, gloss, measurement, of, high, gloss, surfaces, by, goniophotometry, under, the, designation, astm, e430, in, this, standard, it, also, defined, methods, for, the, measurement, of, distinctness, of, image, gloss, and, reflection, haze
