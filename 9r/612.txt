earth, s, inner, core, is, the, innermost, geologic, layer, of, the, planet, earth, it, is, primarily, a, solid, ball, with, a, radius, of, about, 1, 220, km, 760, mi, which, is, about, 20, of, earth, s, radius, or, 70, of, the, moon, s, radius, there, are, no, samples, of, earth, s, core, accessible, for, direct, measurement, as, there, are, for, earth, s, mantle, information, about, earth, s, core, mostly, comes, from, analysis, of, seismic, waves, and, earth, s, magnetic, field, the, inner, core, is, believed, to, be, composed, of, an, iron, nickel, alloy, with, some, other, elements, the, temperature, at, the, inner, core, s, surface, is, estimated, to, be, approximately, 5, 700, k, 5, 430, c, 9, 800, f, which, is, about, the, temperature, at, the, surface, of, the, sun, earth, was, discovered, to, have, a, solid, inner, core, distinct, from, its, molten, outer, core, in, 1936, by, the, danish, seismologist, inge, lehmann, who, deduced, its, presence, by, studying, seismograms, from, earthquakes, in, new, zealand, she, observed, that, the, seismic, waves, reflect, off, the, boundary, of, the, inner, core, and, can, be, detected, by, sensitive, seismographs, on, the, earth, s, surface, she, inferred, a, radius, of, 1, 400, km, 870, mi, for, the, inner, core, not, far, from, the, currently, accepted, value, of, 1, 221, km, 759, mi, in, 1938, beno, gutenberg, and, charles, richter, analyzed, a, more, extensive, set, of, data, and, estimated, the, thickness, of, the, outer, core, as, 1, 950, km, 1, 210, mi, with, a, steep, but, continuous, 300, km, 190, mi, thick, transition, to, the, inner, core, implying, a, radius, between, 1, 230, and, 1, 530, km, 760, and, 950, mi, for, the, inner, core, p, 372, a, few, years, later, in, 1940, it, was, hypothesized, that, this, inner, core, was, made, of, solid, iron, in, 1952, francis, birch, published, a, detailed, analysis, of, the, available, data, and, concluded, that, the, inner, core, was, probably, crystalline, iron, the, boundary, between, the, inner, and, outer, cores, is, sometimes, called, the, lehmann, discontinuity, although, the, name, usually, refers, to, another, discontinuity, the, name, bullen, or, lehmann, bullen, discontinuity, after, keith, edward, bullen, has, been, proposed, but, its, use, seems, to, be, rare, the, rigidity, of, the, inner, core, was, confirmed, in, 1971, adam, dziewonski, and, james, freeman, gilbert, established, that, measurements, of, normal, modes, of, vibration, of, earth, caused, by, large, earthquakes, were, consistent, with, a, liquid, outer, core, in, 2005, shear, waves, were, detected, passing, through, the, inner, core, these, claims, were, initially, controversial, but, are, now, gaining, acceptance, almost, all, direct, measurements, that, scientists, have, about, the, physical, properties, of, the, inner, core, are, the, seismic, waves, that, pass, through, it, deep, earthquakes, generate, the, most, informative, waves, 30, km, or, more, below, the, surface, of, the, earth, where, the, mantle, is, relatively, more, homogeneous, and, are, recorded, by, seismographs, as, they, reach, the, surface, all, over, the, globe, seismic, waves, include, p, primary, or, pressure, waves, compressional, waves, that, can, travel, through, solid, or, liquid, materials, and, s, secondary, or, shear, shear, waves, that, can, only, propagate, through, rigid, elastic, solids, the, two, waves, have, different, velocities, and, are, damped, at, different, rates, as, they, travel, through, the, same, material, of, particular, interest, are, the, so, called, pkikp, waves, pressure, waves, p, that, start, near, the, surface, cross, the, mantle, core, boundary, travel, through, the, core, k, are, reflected, at, the, inner, core, boundary, i, cross, the, liquid, core, k, again, cross, back, into, the, mantle, and, are, detected, as, pressure, waves, p, at, the, surface, also, of, interest, are, the, pkikp, waves, that, travel, through, the, inner, core, i, instead, of, being, reflected, at, its, surface, i, those, signals, are, easier, to, interpret, when, the, path, from, source, to, detector, is, close, to, a, straight, line, namely, when, the, receiver, is, just, above, the, source, for, the, reflected, pkikp, waves, and, antipodal, to, it, for, the, transmitted, pkikp, waves, while, s, waves, cannot, reach, or, leave, the, inner, core, as, such, p, waves, can, be, converted, into, s, waves, and, vice, versa, as, they, hit, the, boundary, between, the, inner, and, outer, core, at, an, oblique, angle, the, pkjkp, waves, are, similar, to, the, pkikp, waves, but, are, converted, into, s, waves, when, they, enter, the, inner, core, travel, through, it, as, s, waves, j, and, are, converted, again, into, p, waves, when, they, exit, the, inner, core, thanks, to, this, phenomenon, it, is, known, that, the, inner, core, can, propagate, s, waves, and, therefore, must, be, solid, other, sources, of, information, about, the, inner, core, include, the, velocity, of, the, s, waves, in, the, core, varies, smoothly, from, about, 3, 7, km, s, at, the, center, to, about, 3, 5, km, s, at, the, surface, that, is, considerably, less, than, the, velocity, of, s, waves, in, the, lower, crust, about, 4, 5, km, s, and, less, than, half, the, velocity, in, the, deep, mantle, just, above, the, outer, core, about, 7, 3, km, s, fig, 2, the, velocity, of, the, p, waves, in, the, core, also, varies, smoothly, through, the, inner, core, from, about, 11, 4, km, s, at, the, center, to, about, 11, 1, km, s, at, the, surface, then, the, speed, drops, abruptly, at, the, inner, outer, core, boundary, to, about, 10, 4, km, s, fig, 2, on, the, basis, of, the, seismic, data, the, inner, core, is, estimated, to, be, about, 1221, km, in, radius, 2442, km, in, diameter, which, is, about, 19, of, the, radius, of, the, earth, and, 70, of, the, radius, of, the, moon, its, volume, is, about, 7, 6, billion, cubic, km, 7, 6, 10, 18, m, 3, which, is, about, 1, 146, 0, 69, of, the, volume, of, the, whole, earth, its, shape, is, believed, to, be, close, to, an, oblate, ellipsoid, of, revolution, like, the, surface, of, the, earth, only, more, spherical, the, flattening, f, is, estimated, to, be, between, 1, 400, and, 1, 416, f, 2, meaning, that, the, radius, along, the, earth, s, axis, is, estimated, to, be, about, 3, km, shorter, than, the, radius, at, the, equator, in, comparison, the, flattening, of, the, earth, as, a, whole, is, close, to, 1, 300, and, the, polar, radius, is, 21, km, shorter, than, the, equatorial, one, the, pressure, in, the, earth, s, inner, core, is, slightly, higher, than, it, is, at, the, boundary, between, the, outer, and, inner, cores, it, ranges, from, about, 330, to, 360, gigapascals, 3, 300, 000, to, 3, 600, 000, atm, the, acceleration, of, gravity, at, the, surface, of, the, inner, core, can, be, computed, to, be, 4, 3, m, s, 2, which, is, less, than, half, the, value, at, the, surface, of, the, earth, 9, 8, m, s, 2, the, density, of, the, inner, core, is, believed, to, vary, smoothly, from, about, 13, 0, kg, l, g, cm, 3, t, m, 3, at, the, center, to, about, 12, 8, kg, l, at, the, surface, as, it, happens, with, other, material, properties, the, density, drops, suddenly, at, that, surface, the, liquid, just, above, the, inner, core, is, believed, to, be, significantly, less, dense, at, about, 12, 1, kg, l, for, comparison, the, average, density, in, the, upper, 100, km, of, the, earth, is, about, 3, 4, kg, l, that, density, implies, a, mass, of, about, 10, 23, kg, for, the, inner, core, which, is, 1, 60, 1, 7, of, the, mass, of, the, whole, earth, the, temperature, of, the, inner, core, can, be, estimated, from, the, melting, temperature, of, impure, iron, at, the, pressure, which, iron, is, under, at, the, boundary, of, the, inner, core, about, 330, gpa, from, these, considerations, in, 2002, d, alf, and, others, estimated, its, temperature, as, between, 5, 400, k, 5, 100, c, 9, 300, f, and, 5, 700, k, 5, 400, c, 9, 800, f, however, in, 2013, s, anzellini, and, others, obtained, experimentally, a, substantially, higher, temperature, for, the, melting, point, of, iron, 6, 230, 500, k, 5, 957, 500, c, 10, 754, 900, f, iron, can, be, solid, at, such, high, temperatures, only, because, its, melting, temperature, increases, dramatically, at, pressures, of, that, magnitude, see, the, clausius, clapeyron, relation, in, 2010, bruce, buffett, determined, that, the, average, magnetic, field, in, the, liquid, outer, core, is, about, 2, 5, milliteslas, 25, gauss, which, is, about, 40, times, the, maximum, strength, at, the, surface, he, started, from, the, known, fact, that, the, moon, and, sun, cause, tides, in, the, liquid, outer, core, just, as, they, do, on, the, oceans, on, the, surface, he, observed, that, motion, of, the, liquid, through, the, local, magnetic, field, creates, electric, currents, that, dissipate, energy, as, heat, according, to, ohm, s, law, this, dissipation, in, turn, damps, the, tidal, motions, and, explains, previously, detected, anomalies, in, earth, s, nutation, from, the, magnitude, of, the, latter, effect, he, could, calculate, the, magnetic, field, the, field, inside, the, inner, core, presumably, has, a, similar, strength, while, indirect, this, measurement, does, not, depend, significantly, on, any, assumptions, about, the, evolution, of, the, earth, or, the, composition, of, the, core, although, seismic, waves, propagate, through, the, core, as, if, it, were, solid, the, measurements, cannot, distinguish, a, solid, material, from, an, extremely, viscous, one, some, scientists, have, therefore, considered, whether, there, may, be, slow, convection, in, the, inner, core, as, is, believed, to, exist, in, the, mantle, that, could, be, an, explanation, for, the, anisotropy, detected, in, seismic, studies, in, 2009, b, buffett, estimated, the, viscosity, of, the, inner, core, at, 10, 18, pa, s, which, is, a, sextillion, times, the, viscosity, of, water, and, more, than, a, billion, times, that, of, pitch, there, is, still, no, direct, evidence, about, the, composition, of, the, inner, core, however, based, on, the, relative, prevalence, of, various, chemical, elements, in, the, solar, system, the, theory, of, planetary, formation, and, constraints, imposed, or, implied, by, the, chemistry, of, the, rest, of, the, earth, s, volume, the, inner, core, is, believed, to, consist, primarily, of, an, iron, nickel, alloy, at, the, known, pressures, and, estimated, temperatures, of, the, core, it, is, predicted, that, pure, iron, could, be, solid, but, its, density, would, exceed, the, known, density, of, the, core, by, approximately, 3, that, result, implies, the, presence, of, lighter, elements, in, the, core, such, as, silicon, oxygen, or, sulfur, in, addition, to, the, probable, presence, of, nickel, recent, estimates, 2007, allow, for, up, to, 10, nickel, and, 2, 3, of, unidentified, lighter, elements, according, to, computations, by, d, alf, and, others, the, liquid, outer, core, contains, 8, 13, of, oxygen, but, as, the, iron, crystallizes, out, to, form, the, inner, core, the, oxygen, is, mostly, left, in, the, liquid, laboratory, experiments, and, analysis, of, seismic, wave, velocities, seem, to, indicate, that, the, inner, core, consists, specifically, of, iron, a, crystalline, form, of, the, metal, with, the, hexagonal, close, packed, hcp, structure, that, structure, can, still, admit, the, inclusion, of, small, amounts, of, nickel, and, other, elements, many, scientists, had, initially, expected, that, the, inner, core, would, be, found, to, be, homogeneous, because, that, same, process, should, have, proceeded, uniformly, during, its, entire, formation, it, was, even, suggested, that, earth, s, inner, core, might, be, a, single, crystal, of, iron, in, 1983, g, poupinet, and, others, observed, that, the, travel, time, of, pkikp, waves, p, waves, that, travel, through, the, inner, core, was, about, 2, seconds, less, for, straight, north, south, paths, than, straight, paths, on, the, equatorial, plane, even, taking, into, account, the, flattening, of, the, earth, at, the, poles, about, 0, 33, for, the, whole, earth, 0, 25, for, the, inner, core, and, crust, and, upper, mantle, heterogeneities, this, difference, implied, that, p, waves, of, a, broad, range, of, wavelengths, travel, through, the, inner, core, about, 1, faster, in, the, north, south, direction, than, along, directions, perpendicular, to, that, this, p, wave, speed, anisotropy, has, been, confirmed, by, later, studies, including, more, seismic, data, and, study, of, the, free, oscillations, of, the, whole, earth, some, authors, have, claimed, higher, values, for, the, difference, up, to, 4, 8, however, in, 2017, daniel, frost, and, barbara, romanowicz, confirmed, that, the, value, is, between, 0, 5, and, 1, 5, some, authors, have, claimed, that, p, wave, speed, is, faster, in, directions, that, are, oblique, or, perpendicular, to, the, n, s, axis, at, least, in, some, regions, of, the, inner, core, however, these, claims, have, been, disputed, by, frost, and, romanowicz, who, instead, claim, that, the, direction, of, maximum, speed, is, as, close, to, the, earth, s, rotation, axis, as, can, be, determined, laboratory, data, and, theoretical, computations, indicate, that, the, propagation, of, pressure, waves, in, the, hcp, crystals, of, iron, are, strongly, anisotropic, too, with, one, fast, axis, and, two, equally, slow, ones, a, preference, for, the, crystals, in, the, core, to, align, in, the, north, south, direction, could, account, for, the, observed, seismic, anomaly, one, phenomenon, that, could, cause, such, partial, alignment, is, slow, flow, creep, inside, the, inner, core, from, the, equator, towards, the, poles, or, vice, versa, that, flow, would, cause, the, crystals, to, partially, reorient, themselves, according, to, the, direction, of, the, flow, in, 1996, s, yoshida, and, others, proposed, that, such, a, flow, could, be, caused, by, higher, rate, of, freezing, at, the, equator, than, at, polar, latitudes, an, equator, to, pole, flow, then, would, set, up, in, the, inner, core, tending, to, restore, the, isostatic, equilibrium, of, its, surface, others, suggested, that, the, required, flow, could, be, caused, by, slow, thermal, convection, inside, the, inner, core, t, yukutake, claimed, in, 1998, that, such, convective, motions, were, unlikely, however, b, buffet, in, 2009, estimated, the, viscosity, of, the, inner, core, and, found, that, such, convection, could, have, happened, especially, when, the, core, was, smaller, on, the, other, hand, m, bergman, in, 1997, proposed, that, the, anisotropy, was, due, to, an, observed, tendency, of, iron, crystals, to, grow, faster, when, their, crystallographic, axes, are, aligned, with, the, direction, of, the, cooling, heat, flow, he, therefore, proposed, that, the, heat, flow, out, of, the, inner, core, would, be, biased, towards, the, radial, direction, in, 1998, s, karato, proposed, that, changes, in, the, magnetic, field, might, also, deform, the, inner, core, slowly, over, time, in, 2002, m, ishii, and, a, dziewo, ski, presented, evidence, that, the, solid, inner, core, contained, an, innermost, inner, core, imic, with, somewhat, different, properties, than, the, shell, around, it, the, nature, of, the, differences, and, radius, of, the, imic, are, still, unresolved, as, of, 2019, with, proposals, for, the, latter, ranging, from, 300, km, to, 750, km, a, wang, and, x, song, proposed, in, 2018, a, three, layer, model, with, an, inner, inner, core, iic, with, about, 500, km, radius, an, outer, inner, core, oic, layer, about, 600, km, thick, and, an, isotropic, shell, 100, km, thick, in, this, model, the, faster, p, wave, direction, would, be, parallel, to, the, earth, s, axis, in, the, oic, but, perpendicular, to, that, axis, in, the, iic, however, the, conclusion, has, been, disputed, by, claims, that, there, need, not, be, sharp, discontinuities, in, the, inner, core, only, a, gradual, change, of, properties, with, depth, in, 2023, a, study, reported, new, evidence, for, an, anisotropically, distinctive, innermost, inner, core, a, 650, km, thick, innermost, ball, and, its, transition, to, a, weakly, anisotropic, outer, shell, which, could, be, a, fossilized, record, of, a, significant, global, event, from, the, past, they, suggest, that, atoms, in, the, iic, atoms, are, slightly, differently, than, its, outer, layer, causing, seismic, waves, to, pass, through, the, iic, at, different, speeds, than, through, the, surrounding, core, p, wave, speeds, 4, slower, at, 50, from, the, earth, s, rotation, axis, in, 1997, s, tanaka, and, h, hamaguchi, claimed, on, the, basis, of, seismic, data, that, the, anisotropy, of, the, inner, core, material, while, oriented, n, s, was, more, pronounced, in, eastern, hemisphere, of, the, inner, core, at, about, 110, e, longitude, roughly, under, borneo, than, in, the, western, hemisphere, at, about, 70, w, roughly, under, colombia, fg, 9, albouss, re, and, others, proposed, that, this, asymmetry, could, be, due, to, melting, in, the, eastern, hemisphere, and, re, crystallization, in, the, western, one, c, finlay, conjectured, that, this, process, could, explain, the, asymmetry, in, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, however, in, 2017, frost, and, romanowicz, disputed, those, earlier, inferences, claiming, that, the, data, shows, only, a, weak, anisotropy, with, the, speed, in, the, n, s, direction, being, only, 0, 5, to, 1, 5, faster, than, in, equatorial, directions, and, no, clear, signs, of, e, w, variation, other, researchers, claim, that, the, properties, of, the, inner, core, s, surface, vary, from, place, to, place, across, distances, as, small, as, 1, km, this, variation, is, surprising, since, lateral, temperature, variations, along, the, inner, core, boundary, are, known, to, be, extremely, small, this, conclusion, is, confidently, constrained, by, magnetic, field, observations, the, earth, s, inner, core, is, thought, to, be, slowly, growing, as, the, liquid, outer, core, at, the, boundary, with, the, inner, core, cools, and, solidifies, due, to, the, gradual, cooling, of, the, earth, s, interior, about, 100, degrees, celsius, per, billion, years, according, to, calculations, by, alf, and, others, as, the, iron, crystallizes, onto, the, inner, core, the, liquid, just, above, it, becomes, enriched, in, oxygen, and, therefore, less, dense, than, the, rest, of, the, outer, core, this, process, creates, convection, currents, in, the, outer, core, which, are, thought, to, be, the, prime, driver, for, the, currents, that, create, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, the, existence, of, the, inner, core, also, affects, the, dynamic, motions, of, liquid, in, the, outer, core, and, thus, may, help, fix, the, magnetic, field, because, the, inner, core, is, not, rigidly, connected, to, the, earth, s, solid, mantle, the, possibility, that, it, rotates, slightly, more, quickly, or, slowly, than, the, rest, of, earth, has, long, been, entertained, in, the, 1990s, seismologists, made, various, claims, about, detecting, this, kind, of, super, rotation, by, observing, changes, in, the, characteristics, of, seismic, waves, passing, through, the, inner, core, over, several, decades, using, the, aforementioned, property, that, it, transmits, waves, more, quickly, in, some, directions, in, 1996, x, song, and, p, richards, estimated, this, super, rotation, of, the, inner, core, relative, to, the, mantle, as, about, one, degree, per, year, in, 2005, they, and, j, zhang, compared, recordings, of, seismic, doublets, recordings, by, the, same, station, of, earthquakes, occurring, in, the, same, location, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, earth, years, apart, and, revised, that, estimate, to, 0, 3, to, 0, 5, degree, per, year, in, 2023, it, was, reported, that, the, core, stopped, spinning, faster, than, the, planet, s, surface, around, 2009, and, likely, is, now, rotating, slower, than, it, this, is, not, thought, to, have, major, effects, and, one, cycle, of, the, oscillation, is, thought, to, be, about, seven, decades, coinciding, with, several, other, geophysical, periodicities, especially, the, length, of, day, and, magnetic, field, in, 1999, m, greff, lefftz, and, h, legros, noted, that, the, gravitational, fields, of, the, sun, and, moon, that, are, responsible, for, ocean, tides, also, apply, torques, to, the, earth, affecting, its, axis, of, rotation, and, a, slowing, down, of, its, rotation, rate, those, torques, are, felt, mainly, by, the, crust, and, mantle, so, that, their, rotation, axis, and, speed, may, differ, from, overall, rotation, of, the, fluid, in, the, outer, core, and, the, rotation, of, the, inner, core, the, dynamics, is, complicated, because, of, the, currents, and, magnetic, fields, in, the, inner, core, they, find, that, the, axis, of, the, inner, core, wobbles, nutates, slightly, with, a, period, of, about, 1, day, with, some, assumptions, on, the, evolution, of, the, earth, they, conclude, that, the, fluid, motions, in, the, outer, core, would, have, entered, resonance, with, the, tidal, forces, at, several, times, in, the, past, 3, 0, 1, 8, and, 0, 3, billion, years, ago, during, those, epochs, which, lasted, 200, 300, million, years, each, the, extra, heat, generated, by, stronger, fluid, motions, might, have, stopped, the, growth, of, the, inner, core, theories, about, the, age, of, the, core, are, necessarily, part, of, theories, of, the, history, of, earth, as, a, whole, this, has, been, a, long, debated, topic, and, is, still, under, discussion, at, the, present, time, it, is, widely, believed, that, the, earth, s, solid, inner, core, formed, out, of, an, initially, completely, liquid, core, as, the, earth, cooled, down, however, there, is, still, no, firm, evidence, about, the, time, when, this, process, started, two, main, approaches, have, been, used, to, infer, the, age, of, the, inner, core, thermodynamic, modeling, of, the, cooling, of, the, earth, and, analysis, of, paleomagnetic, evidence, the, estimates, yielded, by, these, methods, still, vary, over, a, large, range, from, 0, 5, to, 2, billion, years, old, one, of, the, ways, to, estimate, the, age, of, the, inner, core, is, by, modeling, the, cooling, of, the, earth, constrained, by, a, minimum, value, for, the, heat, flux, at, the, core, mantle, boundary, cmb, that, estimate, is, based, on, the, prevailing, theory, that, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, is, primarily, triggered, by, convection, currents, in, the, liquid, part, of, the, core, and, the, fact, that, a, minimum, heat, flux, is, required, to, sustain, those, currents, the, heat, flux, at, the, cmb, at, present, time, can, be, reliably, estimated, because, it, is, related, to, the, measured, heat, flux, at, earth, s, surface, and, to, the, measured, rate, of, mantle, convection, in, 2001, s, labrosse, and, others, assuming, that, there, were, no, radioactive, elements, in, the, core, gave, an, estimate, of, 1, 0, 5, billion, years, for, the, age, of, the, inner, core, considerably, less, than, the, estimated, age, of, the, earth, and, of, its, liquid, core, about, 4, 5, billion, years, in, 2003, the, same, group, concluded, that, if, the, core, contained, a, reasonable, amount, of, radioactive, elements, the, inner, core, s, age, could, be, a, few, hundred, million, years, older, in, 2012, theoretical, computations, by, m, pozzo, and, others, indicated, that, the, electrical, conductivity, of, iron, and, other, hypothetical, core, materials, at, the, high, pressures, and, temperatures, expected, there, were, two, or, three, times, higher, than, assumed, in, previous, research, these, predictions, were, confirmed, in, 2013, by, measurements, by, gomi, and, others, the, higher, values, for, electrical, conductivity, led, to, increased, estimates, of, the, thermal, conductivity, to, 90, w, m, k, which, in, turn, lowered, estimates, of, its, age, to, less, than, 700, million, years, old, however, in, 2016, kon, pkov, and, others, directly, measured, the, thermal, conductivity, of, solid, iron, at, inner, core, conditions, and, obtained, a, much, lower, value, 18, 44, w, m, k, with, those, values, they, obtained, an, upper, bound, of, 4, 2, billion, years, for, the, age, of, the, inner, core, compatible, with, the, paleomagnetic, evidence, in, 2014, driscoll, and, bercovici, published, a, thermal, history, of, the, earth, that, avoided, the, so, called, mantle, thermal, catastrophe, and, new, core, paradox, by, invoking, 3, tw, of, radiogenic, heating, by, the, decay, of, 40, k, in, the, core, such, high, abundances, of, k, in, the, core, are, not, supported, by, experimental, partitioning, studies, so, such, a, thermal, history, remains, highly, debatable, another, way, to, estimate, the, age, of, the, earth, is, to, analyze, changes, in, the, magnetic, field, of, earth, during, its, history, as, trapped, in, rocks, that, formed, at, various, times, the, paleomagnetic, record, the, presence, or, absence, of, the, solid, inner, core, could, result, in, different, dynamic, processes, in, the, core, that, could, lead, to, noticeable, changes, in, the, magnetic, field, in, 2011, smirnov, and, others, published, an, analysis, of, the, paleomagnetism, in, a, large, sample, of, rocks, that, formed, in, the, neoarchean, 2, 8, 2, 5, billion, years, ago, and, the, proterozoic, 2, 5, 0, 541, billion, they, found, that, the, geomagnetic, field, was, closer, to, that, of, a, magnetic, dipole, during, the, neoarchean, than, after, it, they, interpreted, that, change, as, evidence, that, the, dynamo, effect, was, more, deeply, seated, in, the, core, during, that, epoch, whereas, in, the, later, time, currents, closer, to, the, core, mantle, boundary, grew, in, importance, they, further, speculate, that, the, change, may, have, been, due, to, growth, of, the, solid, inner, core, between, 3, 5, 2, 0, billion, years, ago, in, 2015, biggin, and, others, published, the, analysis, of, an, extensive, and, carefully, selected, set, of, precambrian, samples, and, observed, a, prominent, increase, in, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, strength, and, variance, around, 1, 0, 1, 5, billion, years, ago, this, change, had, not, been, noticed, before, due, to, the, lack, of, sufficient, robust, measurements, they, speculated, that, the, change, could, be, due, to, the, birth, of, earth, s, solid, inner, core, from, their, age, estimate, they, derived, a, rather, modest, value, for, the, thermal, conductivity, of, the, outer, core, that, allowed, for, simpler, models, of, the, earth, s, thermal, evolution, in, 2016, p, driscoll, published, a, numerical, evolving, dynamo, model, that, made, a, detailed, prediction, of, the, paleomagnetic, field, evolution, over, 0, 0, 2, 0, ga, the, evolving, dynamo, model, was, driven, by, time, variable, boundary, conditions, produced, by, the, thermal, history, solution, in, driscoll, and, bercovici, 2014, the, evolving, dynamo, model, predicted, a, strong, field, dynamo, prior, to, 1, 7, ga, that, is, multipolar, a, strong, field, dynamo, from, 1, 0, 1, 7, ga, that, is, predominantly, dipolar, a, weak, field, dynamo, from, 0, 6, 1, 0, ga, that, is, a, non, axial, dipole, and, a, strong, field, dynamo, after, inner, core, nucleation, from, 0, 0, 0, 6, ga, that, is, predominantly, dipolar, an, analysis, of, rock, samples, from, the, ediacaran, epoch, formed, about, 565, million, years, ago, published, by, bono, and, others, in, 2019, revealed, unusually, low, intensity, and, two, distinct, directions, for, the, geomagnetic, field, during, that, time, that, provides, support, for, the, predictions, by, driscoll, 2016, considering, other, evidence, of, high, frequency, of, magnetic, field, reversals, around, that, time, they, speculate, that, those, anomalies, could, be, due, to, the, onset, of, formation, of, the, inner, core, which, would, then, be, 0, 5, billion, years, old, a, news, and, views, by, p, driscoll, summarizes, the, state, of, the, field, following, the, bono, results, new, paleomagnetic, data, from, the, cambrian, appear, to, support, this, hypothesis
