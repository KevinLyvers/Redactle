aeolian, processes, also, spelled, eolian, pertain, to, wind, activity, in, the, study, of, geology, and, weather, and, specifically, to, the, wind, s, ability, to, shape, the, surface, of, the, earth, or, other, planets, winds, may, erode, transport, and, deposit, materials, and, are, effective, agents, in, regions, with, sparse, vegetation, a, lack, of, soil, moisture, and, a, large, supply, of, unconsolidated, sediments, although, water, is, a, much, more, powerful, eroding, force, than, wind, aeolian, processes, are, important, in, arid, environments, such, as, deserts, the, term, is, derived, from, the, name, of, the, greek, god, aeolus, the, keeper, of, the, winds, aeolian, processes, are, those, processes, of, erosion, transport, and, deposition, of, sediments, that, are, caused, by, wind, at, or, near, the, surface, of, the, earth, sediment, deposits, produced, by, the, action, of, wind, and, the, sedimentary, structures, characteristic, of, these, deposits, are, also, described, as, aeolian, aeolian, processes, are, most, important, in, areas, where, there, is, little, or, no, vegetation, however, aeolian, deposits, are, not, restricted, to, arid, climates, they, are, also, seen, along, shorelines, along, stream, courses, in, semiarid, climates, in, areas, of, ample, sand, weathered, from, weakly, cemented, sandstone, outcrops, and, in, areas, of, glacial, outwash, loess, which, is, silt, deposited, by, wind, is, common, in, humid, to, subhumid, climates, much, of, north, america, and, europe, are, underlain, by, sand, and, loess, of, pleistocene, age, originating, from, glacial, outwash, the, lee, downwind, side, of, river, valleys, in, semiarid, regions, are, often, blanketed, with, sand, and, sand, dunes, examples, in, north, america, include, the, platte, arkansas, and, missouri, rivers, wind, erodes, the, earth, s, surface, by, deflation, the, removal, of, loose, fine, grained, particles, by, the, turbulent, action, of, the, wind, and, by, abrasion, the, wearing, down, of, surfaces, by, the, grinding, action, and, sandblasting, by, windborne, particles, once, entrained, in, the, wind, collisions, between, particles, further, break, them, down, a, process, called, attrition, worldwide, erosion, by, water, is, more, important, than, erosion, by, wind, but, wind, erosion, is, important, in, semiarid, and, arid, regions, wind, erosion, is, increased, by, some, human, activities, such, as, the, use, of, 4x4, vehicles, deflation, is, the, lifting, and, removal, of, loose, material, from, the, surface, by, wind, turbulence, it, takes, place, by, three, mechanisms, traction, surface, creep, saltation, and, suspension, traction, or, surface, creep, is, a, process, of, larger, grains, sliding, or, rolling, across, the, surface, saltation, refers, to, particles, bouncing, across, the, surface, for, short, distances, suspended, particles, are, fully, entrained, in, the, wind, which, carries, them, for, long, distances, saltation, likely, accounts, for, 50, 70, of, deflation, while, suspension, accounts, for, 30, 40, and, surface, creep, accounts, for, 5, 25, regions, which, experience, intense, and, sustained, erosion, are, called, deflation, zones, most, aeolian, deflation, zones, are, composed, of, desert, pavement, a, sheet, like, surface, of, rock, fragments, that, remains, after, wind, and, water, have, removed, the, fine, particles, the, rock, mantle, in, desert, pavements, protects, the, underlying, material, from, further, deflation, areas, of, desert, pavement, form, the, regs, or, stony, deserts, of, the, sahara, these, are, further, divided, into, rocky, areas, called, hamadas, and, areas, of, small, rocks, and, gravel, called, serirs, desert, pavement, is, extremely, common, in, desert, environments, blowouts, are, hollows, formed, by, wind, deflation, blowouts, are, generally, small, but, may, be, up, to, several, kilometers, in, diameter, the, smallest, are, mere, dimples, 0, 3, meters, 1, ft, deep, and, 3, meters, 10, ft, in, diameter, the, largest, include, the, blowout, hollows, of, mongolia, which, can, be, 8, kilometers, 5, mi, across, and, 60, to, 100, meters, 200, to, 400, ft, deep, big, hollow, in, wyoming, us, extends, 14, by, 9, 7, kilometers, 9, by, 6, mi, and, is, up, to, 90, meters, 300, ft, deep, abrasion, also, sometimes, called, corrasion, is, the, process, of, wind, driven, grains, knocking, or, wearing, material, off, of, landforms, it, was, once, considered, a, major, contributor, to, desert, erosion, but, by, the, mid, 20th, century, it, had, come, to, be, considered, much, less, important, wind, can, normally, lift, sand, only, a, short, distance, with, most, windborne, sand, remaining, within, 50, centimeters, 20, in, of, the, surface, and, practically, none, normally, being, carried, above, 2, meters, 6, ft, many, desert, features, once, attributed, to, wind, abrasion, including, wind, caves, mushroom, rocks, and, the, honeycomb, weathering, called, tafoni, are, now, attributed, to, differential, weathering, rainwash, deflation, rather, than, abrasion, or, other, processes, yardangs, are, one, kind, of, desert, feature, that, is, widely, attributed, to, wind, abrasion, these, are, rock, ridges, up, to, tens, of, meters, high, and, kilometers, long, that, have, been, streamlined, by, desert, winds, yardangs, characteristically, show, elongated, furrows, or, grooves, aligned, with, the, prevailing, wind, they, form, mostly, in, softer, material, such, as, silts, abrasion, produces, polishing, and, pitting, grooving, shaping, and, faceting, of, exposed, surfaces, these, are, widespread, in, arid, environments, but, geologically, insignificant, polished, or, faceted, surfaces, called, ventifacts, are, rare, requiring, abundant, sand, powerful, winds, and, a, lack, of, vegetation, for, their, formation, in, parts, of, antarctica, wind, blown, snowflakes, that, are, technically, sediments, have, also, caused, abrasion, of, exposed, rocks, attrition, is, the, wearing, down, by, collisions, of, particles, entrained, in, a, moving, fluid, it, is, effective, at, rounding, sand, grains, and, at, giving, them, a, distinctive, frosted, surface, texture, collisions, between, windborne, particles, is, a, major, source, of, dust, in, the, size, range, of, 2, 5, microns, most, of, this, is, produced, by, the, removal, of, a, weathered, clay, coating, from, the, grains, wind, dominates, the, transport, of, sand, and, finer, sediments, in, arid, environments, wind, transport, is, also, important, in, periglacial, areas, on, river, flood, plains, and, in, coastal, areas, coastal, winds, transport, significant, amounts, of, siliciclastic, and, carbonate, sediments, inland, while, wind, storms, and, dust, storms, can, carry, clay, and, silt, particles, great, distances, wind, transports, much, of, the, sediments, deposited, in, deep, ocean, basins, in, ergs, desert, sand, seas, wind, is, very, effective, at, transporting, grains, of, sand, size, and, smaller, particles, are, transported, by, winds, through, suspension, saltation, skipping, or, bouncing, and, creeping, rolling, or, sliding, along, the, ground, the, minimum, wind, velocity, to, initiate, transport, is, called, the, fluid, threshold, or, static, threshold, and, is, the, wind, velocity, required, to, begin, dislodging, grains, from, the, surface, once, transport, is, initiated, there, is, a, cascade, effect, from, grains, tearing, loose, other, grains, so, that, transport, continues, until, the, wind, velocity, drops, below, the, dynamic, threshold, or, impact, threshold, which, is, usually, less, than, the, fluid, threshold, in, other, words, there, is, hysteresis, in, the, wind, transport, system, small, particles, may, be, held, in, the, atmosphere, in, suspension, turbulent, air, motion, supports, the, weight, of, suspended, particles, and, allows, them, to, be, transported, for, great, distances, wind, is, particularly, effective, at, separating, sediment, grains, under, 0, 05, mm, in, size, from, coarser, grains, as, suspended, particles, saltation, is, downwind, movement, of, particles, in, a, series, of, jumps, or, skips, saltation, is, most, important, for, grains, of, up, to, 2, mm, in, size, a, saltating, grain, may, hit, other, grains, that, jump, up, to, continue, the, saltation, the, grain, may, also, hit, larger, grains, over, 2, mm, in, size, that, are, too, heavy, to, hop, but, that, slowly, creep, forward, as, they, are, pushed, by, saltating, grains, surface, creep, accounts, for, as, much, as, 25, percent, of, grain, movement, in, a, desert, vegetation, is, effective, at, suppressing, aeolian, transport, vegetation, cover, of, as, little, as, 15, is, sufficient, to, eliminate, most, sand, transport, the, size, of, shore, dunes, is, limited, mostly, by, the, amount, of, open, space, between, vegetated, areas, aeolian, transport, from, deserts, plays, an, important, role, in, ecosystems, globally, for, example, wind, transports, minerals, from, the, sahara, to, the, amazon, basin, saharan, dust, is, also, responsible, for, forming, red, clay, soils, in, southern, europe, dust, storms, are, wind, storms, that, have, entrained, enough, dust, to, reduce, visibility, to, less, than, 1, kilometer, 0, 6, mi, most, occur, on, the, synoptic, regional, scale, due, to, strong, winds, along, weather, fronts, or, locally, from, downbursts, from, thunderstorms, crops, people, and, possibly, even, climates, are, affected, by, dust, storms, on, earth, dust, can, cross, entire, oceans, as, occurs, with, dust, from, the, sahara, that, reaches, the, amazon, basin, dust, storms, on, mars, periodically, engulf, the, entire, planet, when, the, mariner, 9, spacecraft, entered, its, orbit, around, mars, in, 1971, a, dust, storm, lasting, one, month, covered, the, entire, planet, thus, delaying, the, task, of, photo, mapping, the, planet, s, surface, most, of, the, dust, carried, by, dust, storms, is, in, the, form, of, silt, size, particles, deposits, of, this, windblown, silt, are, known, as, loess, the, thickest, known, deposit, of, loess, up, to, 350, meters, 1, 150, ft, is, on, the, loess, plateau, in, china, this, very, same, asian, dust, is, blown, for, thousands, of, miles, forming, deep, beds, in, places, as, far, away, as, hawaii, the, peoria, loess, of, north, america, is, up, to, 40, meters, 130, ft, thick, in, parts, of, western, iowa, the, soils, developed, on, loess, are, generally, highly, productive, for, agriculture, small, whirlwinds, called, dust, devils, are, common, in, arid, lands, and, are, thought, to, be, related, to, very, intense, local, heating, of, the, air, that, results, in, instabilities, of, the, air, mass, dust, devils, may, be, as, much, as, one, kilometer, high, dust, devils, on, mars, have, been, observed, as, high, as, 10, kilometers, 6, 2, mi, though, this, is, uncommon, wind, is, very, effective, at, separating, sand, from, silt, and, clay, as, a, result, there, are, distinct, sandy, erg, and, silty, loess, aeolian, deposits, with, only, limited, interbedding, between, the, two, loess, deposits, are, found, further, from, the, original, source, of, sediments, than, ergs, an, example, of, this, is, the, sand, hills, of, nebraska, us, here, vegetation, stabilized, sand, dunes, are, found, to, the, west, and, loess, deposits, to, the, east, further, from, the, original, sediment, source, in, the, ogallala, formation, at, the, feet, of, the, rocky, mountains, some, of, the, most, significant, experimental, measurements, on, aeolian, landforms, were, performed, by, ralph, alger, bagnold, a, british, army, engineer, who, worked, in, egypt, prior, to, world, war, ii, bagnold, investigated, the, physics, of, particles, moving, through, the, atmosphere, and, deposited, by, wind, he, recognized, two, basic, dune, types, the, crescentic, dune, which, he, called, barchan, and, the, linear, dune, which, he, called, longitudinal, or, seif, arabic, for, sword, bagnold, developed, a, classification, scheme, that, included, small, scale, ripples, and, sand, sheets, as, well, as, various, types, of, dunes, bagnold, s, classification, is, most, applicable, in, areas, devoid, of, vegetation, in, 1941, john, tilton, hack, added, parabolic, dunes, which, are, strongly, influenced, by, vegetation, to, the, list, of, dune, types, the, discovery, of, dunes, on, mars, reinvigorated, aeolian, process, research, which, increasingly, makes, use, of, computer, simulation, wind, deposited, materials, hold, clues, to, past, as, well, as, to, present, wind, directions, and, intensities, these, features, help, us, understand, the, present, climate, and, the, forces, that, molded, it, for, example, vast, inactive, ergs, in, much, of, the, modern, world, attest, to, late, pleistocene, trade, wind, belts, being, much, expanded, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, ice, cores, show, a, tenfold, increase, in, non, volcanic, dust, during, glacial, maxima, the, highest, dust, peak, in, the, vostok, ice, cores, dates, to, 20, to, 21, thousand, years, ago, the, abundant, dust, is, attributed, to, a, vigorous, low, latitude, wind, system, plus, more, exposed, continental, shelf, due, to, low, sea, levels, wind, deposited, sand, bodies, occur, as, ripples, and, other, small, scale, features, sand, sheets, and, dunes, wind, blowing, on, a, sand, surface, ripples, the, surface, into, crests, and, troughs, whose, long, axes, are, perpendicular, to, the, wind, direction, the, average, length, of, jumps, during, saltation, corresponds, to, the, wavelength, or, distance, between, adjacent, crests, of, the, ripples, in, ripples, the, coarsest, materials, collect, at, the, crests, causing, inverse, grading, this, distinguishes, small, ripples, from, dunes, where, the, coarsest, materials, are, generally, in, the, troughs, this, is, also, a, distinguishing, feature, between, water, laid, ripples, and, aeolian, ripples, a, sand, shadow, is, an, accumulation, of, sand, on, the, downwind, side, of, an, obstruction, such, as, a, boulder, or, an, isolated, patch, of, vegetation, here, the, sand, builds, up, to, the, angle, of, repose, the, maximum, stable, slope, angle, about, 34, degrees, then, begins, sliding, down, the, slip, face, of, the, patch, a, sandfall, is, a, sand, shadow, of, a, cliff, or, escarpment, closely, related, to, sand, shadows, are, sand, drifts, these, form, downwind, of, a, gap, between, obstructions, due, to, the, funneling, effect, of, the, obstructions, on, the, wind, sand, sheets, are, flat, or, gently, undulating, sandy, deposits, with, only, small, surface, ripples, an, example, is, the, selima, sand, sheet, in, the, eastern, sahara, desert, which, occupies, 60, 000, square, kilometers, 23, 000, sq, mi, in, southern, egypt, and, northern, sudan, this, consists, of, a, few, feet, of, sand, resting, on, bedrock, sand, sheets, are, often, remarkably, flat, and, are, sometimes, described, as, desert, peneplains, sand, sheets, are, common, in, desert, environments, particularly, on, the, margins, of, dune, fields, although, they, also, occur, within, ergs, conditions, that, favor, the, formation, of, sand, sheets, instead, of, dunes, may, include, surface, cementation, a, high, water, table, the, effects, of, vegetation, periodic, flooding, or, sediments, rich, in, grains, too, coarse, for, effective, saltation, a, dune, is, an, accumulations, of, sediment, blown, by, the, wind, into, a, mound, or, ridge, they, differ, from, sand, shadows, or, sand, drifts, in, that, they, are, independent, of, any, topographic, obstacle, dunes, have, gentle, upwind, slopes, on, the, windward, side, the, downwind, portion, of, the, dune, the, lee, slope, is, commonly, a, steep, avalanche, slope, referred, to, as, a, slipface, dunes, may, have, more, than, one, slipface, the, minimum, height, of, a, slipface, is, about, 30, centimeters, wind, blown, sand, moves, up, the, gentle, upwind, side, of, the, dune, by, saltation, or, creep, sand, accumulates, at, the, brink, the, top, of, the, slipface, when, the, buildup, of, sand, at, the, brink, exceeds, the, angle, of, repose, a, small, avalanche, of, grains, slides, down, the, slipface, grain, by, grain, the, dune, moves, downwind, dunes, take, three, general, forms, linear, dunes, also, called, longitudinal, dunes, or, seifs, are, aligned, in, the, direction, of, the, prevailing, winds, transverse, dunes, which, include, crescent, dunes, barchans, are, aligned, perpendicular, to, the, prevailing, winds, more, complex, dunes, such, as, star, dunes, form, where, the, directions, of, the, winds, are, highly, variable, additional, dune, types, arise, from, various, kinds, of, topographic, forcing, such, as, from, isolated, hills, or, escarpments, transverse, dunes, occur, in, areas, dominated, by, a, single, direction, of, the, prevailing, wind, in, areas, where, sand, is, not, abundant, transverse, dunes, take, the, form, of, barchans, or, crescent, dunes, these, are, not, common, but, they, are, highly, recognizable, with, a, distinctive, crescent, shape, with, the, tips, of, the, crescent, directed, downwind, the, dunes, are, widely, separated, by, areas, of, bedrock, or, reg, barchans, migrate, up, to, 30, meters, 98, ft, per, year, with, the, taller, dunes, migrating, faster, barchans, first, form, when, some, minor, topographic, feature, creates, a, sand, patch, this, grows, into, a, sand, mound, and, the, converging, streamlines, of, the, air, flow, around, the, mound, build, it, into, the, distinctive, crescent, shape, growth, is, ultimately, limited, by, the, carrying, capacity, of, the, wind, which, as, the, wind, becomes, saturated, with, sediments, builds, up, the, slip, face, of, the, dune, because, barchans, develop, in, areas, of, limited, sand, availability, they, are, poorly, preserved, in, the, geologic, record, where, sand, is, more, abundant, transverse, dunes, take, the, form, of, akl, dunes, such, as, those, of, the, western, sahara, these, form, a, network, of, sinuous, ridges, perpendicular, to, the, wind, direction, akl, dunes, are, preserved, in, the, geologic, record, as, sandstone, with, large, sets, of, cross, bedding, and, many, reactivation, surfaces, draas, are, very, large, composite, transverse, dunes, they, can, be, up, to, 4, 000, meters, 13, 000, ft, across, and, 400, meters, 1, 300, ft, high, and, extend, lengthwise, for, hundreds, of, kilometers, in, form, they, resemble, a, large, akl, or, barchanoid, dune, they, form, over, a, prolonged, period, of, time, in, areas, of, abundant, sand, and, show, a, complex, internal, structure, careful, 3, d, mapping, is, required, to, determine, the, morphology, of, a, draa, preserved, in, the, geologic, record, linear, dunes, can, be, traced, up, to, tens, of, kilometers, with, heights, sometimes, in, excess, of, 70, meters, 230, ft, they, are, typically, several, hundred, meters, across, and, are, spaced, 1, to, 2, kilometers, 0, 62, to, 1, 24, mi, apart, they, sometimes, coalesce, at, a, y, junction, with, the, fork, directed, upwind, they, have, a, sharp, sinuous, or, en, echelon, crest, they, are, thought, to, form, from, a, bimodal, seasonal, wind, pattern, with, a, weak, wind, season, characterized, by, wind, directed, an, at, acute, angle, to, the, prevailing, winds, of, the, strong, wind, season, the, strong, wind, season, produces, a, barchan, form, and, the, weak, wind, season, stretches, this, into, the, linear, form, another, possibility, is, that, these, dunes, result, from, secondary, flow, though, the, precise, mechanism, remains, uncertain, complex, dunes, star, dunes, or, rhourd, dunes, are, characterized, by, having, more, than, two, slip, faces, they, are, typically, 500, to, 1, 000, meters, 1, 600, to, 3, 300, ft, across, and, 50, to, 300, meters, 160, to, 980, ft, high, they, consist, of, a, central, peak, with, radiating, crests, and, are, thought, to, form, where, strong, winds, can, come, from, any, direction, those, in, gran, desierto, de, altar, of, mexico, are, thought, to, have, formed, from, precursor, linear, dunes, due, to, a, change, in, the, wind, pattern, about, 3000, years, ago, complex, dunes, show, little, lateral, growth, but, strong, vertical, growth, and, are, important, sand, sinks, vegetated, parabolic, dunes, are, crescent, shaped, but, the, ends, of, the, crescent, point, upwind, not, downwind, they, form, from, the, interaction, of, vegetation, patches, with, active, sand, sources, such, as, blowouts, the, vegetation, stabilizes, the, arms, of, the, dune, and, an, elongated, lake, sometimes, forms, between, the, arms, of, the, dune, clay, dunes, are, uncommon, but, have, been, found, in, africa, australia, and, along, the, gulf, coast, of, north, america, these, form, on, mud, flats, on, the, margins, of, saline, bodies, of, water, subject, to, strong, prevailing, winds, during, a, dry, season, clay, particles, are, bound, into, sand, sized, pellets, by, salts, and, are, then, deposited, in, the, dunes, where, the, return, of, the, cool, season, allows, the, pellets, to, absorb, moisture, and, become, bound, to, the, dune, surface, deserts, cover, 20, to, 25, percent, of, the, modern, land, surface, of, the, earth, mostly, between, the, latitudes, of, 10, to, 30, degrees, north, or, south, here, the, descending, part, of, the, tropical, atmospheric, circulation, the, hadley, cell, produces, high, atmospheric, pressure, and, suppresses, precipitation, large, areas, of, this, desert, is, floored, with, windblown, sand, such, areas, are, called, ergs, when, they, exceed, about, 125, square, kilometers, 48, sq, mi, in, area, or, dune, fields, when, smaller, ergs, and, dune, fields, make, up, about, 20, of, modern, deserts, or, about, 6, of, the, earth, s, total, land, surface, the, sandy, areas, of, today, s, world, are, somewhat, anomalous, deserts, in, both, the, present, day, and, in, the, geological, record, are, usually, dominated, by, alluvial, fans, rather, than, dune, fields, the, present, relative, abundance, of, sandy, areas, may, reflect, reworking, of, tertiary, sediments, following, the, last, glacial, maximum, most, modern, deserts, have, experienced, extreme, quaternary, climate, change, and, the, sediments, that, are, now, being, churned, by, wind, systems, were, generated, in, upland, areas, during, previous, pluvial, moist, periods, and, transported, to, depositional, basins, by, stream, flow, the, sediments, already, sorted, during, their, initial, fluvial, transport, were, further, sorted, by, wind, which, also, sculpted, the, sediments, into, eolian, landforms, the, state, of, an, aeolian, system, depends, mainly, on, three, things, the, amount, of, sediment, supply, the, availability, of, sediments, and, the, transport, capacity, of, the, winds, the, sediment, supply, is, largely, produced, in, pluvial, periods, periods, of, greater, rainfall, and, accumulates, by, runoff, as, fan, deltas, or, terminal, fans, in, sedimentary, basins, another, important, source, of, sediments, is, the, reworking, of, carbonate, sediments, on, continental, shelves, exposed, during, times, of, lower, sea, level, sediment, availability, depends, on, the, coarseness, of, the, local, sediment, supply, the, degree, of, exposure, of, sediment, grains, the, amount, of, soil, moisture, and, the, extent, of, vegetation, coverage, the, potential, transport, rate, of, wind, is, usually, more, than, the, actual, transport, because, the, sediment, supply, is, usually, insufficient, to, saturate, the, wind, in, other, words, most, aeolian, systems, are, transport, undersaturated, or, sediment, undersaturated, aeolian, desert, systems, can, be, divided, into, wet, dry, or, stabilized, systems, dry, systems, have, the, water, table, well, below, the, surface, where, it, has, no, stabilizing, effect, on, sediments, dune, shapes, determine, whether, sediment, is, deposited, simply, moves, across, surface, a, bypass, system, or, erosion, takes, place, wet, systems, are, characterized, by, a, water, table, near, the, depositional, surface, which, exerts, a, strong, control, on, deposition, bypass, or, erosion, stabilized, systems, have, significant, vegetation, surface, cement, or, mud, drapes, which, dominate, the, evolution, of, the, system, the, sahara, shows, the, full, range, of, all, three, types, the, movement, of, sediments, in, aeolian, systems, can, be, represented, by, sand, flow, maps, these, are, based, on, meteorological, observations, bedform, orientations, and, trends, of, yardangs, they, are, analogous, to, drainage, maps, but, are, not, as, closely, tied, to, topography, since, wind, can, blow, sand, significant, distances, uphill, the, sahara, of, north, africa, is, the, largest, hot, desert, in, the, world, flowlines, can, be, traced, from, erg, to, erg, demonstrating, very, long, transport, downwind, satellite, observations, show, yardangs, aligned, with, the, sandflow, lines, all, flowlines, arise, in, the, desert, itself, and, show, indications, of, clockwise, circulation, roughly, like, high, pressure, cells, the, greatest, deflation, occurs, in, dried, lake, beds, where, trade, winds, form, a, low, level, jet, between, the, tibesti, mountains, and, the, ennedi, plateau, the, flowlines, eventually, reach, the, sea, creating, great, plume, of, saharan, dust, extending, thousands, of, kilometers, into, the, atlantic, ocean, this, creates, a, steady, rain, of, silt, into, the, ocean, it, is, estimated, that, 260, million, tons, of, sediments, are, transported, through, this, system, each, year, but, the, amount, was, much, greater, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, based, on, deep, sea, cores, mineral, dust, of, 0, 1, 1, microns, in, size, is, a, good, shortwave, radiation, scatterer, and, has, a, cooling, effect, on, climate, another, example, of, an, aeolian, system, is, the, arid, interior, of, australia, with, few, topographic, barriers, to, sand, movement, an, anticlockwise, wind, system, is, traced, by, systems, of, longitudinal, dunes, the, namib, and, oman, ergs, are, fed, by, coastal, sediments, the, namib, receives, its, sediments, from, the, south, through, narrow, deflation, corridors, from, coast, that, cross, more, than, 100, kilometers, 62, mi, of, bedrock, to, the, erg, the, oman, was, created, by, deflation, of, marine, shelf, carbonates, during, the, last, pleistocene, lowstand, of, the, sea, the, loess, plateau, of, china, has, been, a, long, term, sink, for, sediments, during, the, quaternary, ice, age, it, provides, a, record, of, glaciation, in, the, form, of, glacial, loess, layers, separated, by, paleosols, fossil, soils, the, loess, layers, were, desposited, by, a, strong, northwest, winter, monsoon, while, the, paleosols, record, the, influence, of, a, moist, southeast, monsoon, the, african, savannah, is, mostly, ergs, deposited, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, that, are, now, stabilized, by, vegetation, major, global, aeolian, systems, thought, to, be, linked, with, weather, and, climate, variation, aeolian, processes, can, be, discerned, at, work, in, the, geologic, record, as, long, ago, as, the, precambrian, aeolian, formations, are, prominent, in, the, paleozoic, and, mesozoic, of, the, western, us, other, examples, include, the, permian, rotliegendes, of, northwestern, europe, the, jurassic, cretaceous, botucatu, formation, of, the, parana, basin, of, brazil, the, permian, lower, bunter, sandstone, of, britain, the, permian, triassic, corrie, sandstone, and, hopeman, sandstone, of, scotland, and, the, proterozoic, sandstones, of, india, and, northwest, africa, perhaps, the, best, examples, of, aeolian, processes, in, the, geologic, record, are, the, jurassic, ergs, of, the, western, us, these, include, the, wingate, sandstone, the, navajo, sandstone, and, the, page, sandstone, individual, formations, are, separated, by, regional, unconformities, indicate, erg, stabilization, the, ergs, interfingered, with, adjacent, river, systems, as, with, the, wingate, sandstone, interfingering, with, the, moenave, formation, and, the, navajo, sandstone, with, the, kayenta, formation, the, navajo, and, nugget, sandstones, were, part, of, the, largest, erg, deposit, in, the, geologic, record, these, formations, are, up, to, 700, meters, 2, 300, ft, thick, and, are, exposed, over, 265, 000, square, kilometers, 102, 000, sq, mi, their, original, extent, was, likely, 2, 5, times, the, present, outcrop, area, though, once, thought, to, possibly, be, marine, in, origin, they, are, now, all, but, universally, regarded, as, aeolian, deposits, they, are, made, up, mostly, of, fine, to, medium, sized, quartz, grains, that, are, well, rounded, and, frosted, both, indications, of, aeolian, transport, the, navajo, contains, huge, tabular, crossbed, sets, with, sweeping, foresets, individual, crossbed, sets, dip, at, an, angle, of, more, than, 20, degrees, and, are, from, 5, to, 35, meters, 16, to, 115, ft, thick, the, formation, contains, freshwater, invertebrate, fossils, and, vertebrate, tracks, slump, structures, contorted, bedding, are, present, that, resemble, those, in, modern, wetted, dunes, successive, migrating, dunes, deposited, a, vertical, stacking, of, eolian, beds, between, interdune, bounding, surfaces, and, regional, supersurfaces, the, permian, rotliegend, group, of, the, north, sea, and, north, europe, contains, sediments, from, adjacent, uplands, erg, sand, bodies, within, the, group, are, up, to, 500, meters, 1, 600, ft, thick, study, of, the, crossbedding, shows, that, sediments, were, deposited, by, a, clockwise, atmospheric, cell, drilling, core, show, dry, and, wet, interdune, surfaces, and, regional, supersurfaces, and, provide, evidence, of, five, or, more, cycles, of, erg, expansion, and, contraction, a, global, rise, in, sea, level, finally, drowned, the, erg, and, deposited, the, beds, of, the, weissliegend, the, cedar, mesa, sandstone, in, utah, was, contemporary, with, the, rogliegend, this, formation, records, at, least, 12, erg, sequences, bounded, by, regional, deflation, supersurfaces, aeolian, landforms, preserved, in, the, formation, range, from, damp, sandsheet, and, lake, paleosol, fossil, soil, beds, to, thin, chaotically, arranged, dune, sets, to, equilibrium, erg, construction, with, dunes, 300, to, 400, meters, 980, to, 1, 310, ft, wide, migrating, over, still, larger, draas, the, draas, survived, individual, climate, cycles, and, their, interdunes, were, sites, of, barchan, nucleation, during, arid, portions, of, the, climate, cycles
