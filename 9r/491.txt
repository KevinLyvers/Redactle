organosilicon, chemistry, is, the, study, of, organometallic, compounds, containing, carbon, silicon, bonds, to, which, they, are, called, organosilicon, compounds, most, organosilicon, compounds, are, similar, to, the, ordinary, organic, compounds, being, colourless, flammable, hydrophobic, and, stable, to, air, silicon, carbide, is, an, inorganic, compound, in, 1863, charles, friedel, and, james, crafts, made, the, first, organochlorosilane, compound, the, same, year, they, also, described, a, polysilicic, acid, ether, in, the, preparation, of, ethyl, and, methyl, o, silicic, acid, extensive, research, in, the, field, of, organosilicon, compounds, was, pioneered, in, the, beginning, of, 20th, century, by, frederic, s, kipping, he, also, had, coined, the, term, silicone, resembling, ketones, this, is, erroneous, though, 286, in, relation, to, these, materials, in, 1904, in, recognition, of, kipping, s, achievements, the, dow, chemical, company, had, established, an, award, in, 1960s, that, is, given, for, significant, contributions, into, the, silicon, chemistry, in, his, works, kipping, was, noted, for, using, grignard, reagents, to, make, alkyl, silanes, and, aryl, silanes, and, the, preparation, of, silicone, oligomers, and, polymers, for, the, first, time, in, 1945, eugene, g, rochow, also, made, a, significant, contribution, into, the, organosilicon, chemistry, by, first, describing, m, ller, rochow, process, organosilicon, compounds, are, widely, encountered, in, commercial, products, most, common, are, antifoamers, caulks, sealant, adhesives, and, coatings, made, from, silicones, other, important, uses, include, agricultural, and, plant, control, adjuvants, commonly, used, in, conjunction, with, herbicides, and, fungicides, carbon, silicon, bonds, are, absent, in, biology, however, enzymes, have, been, used, to, artificially, create, carbon, silicon, bonds, in, living, microbes, silicates, on, the, other, hand, have, known, existence, in, diatoms, silafluofen, is, an, organosilicon, compound, that, functions, as, a, pyrethroid, insecticide, several, organosilicon, compounds, have, been, investigated, as, pharmaceuticals, in, the, great, majority, of, organosilicon, compounds, si, is, tetravalent, with, tetrahedral, molecular, geometry, compared, to, carbon, carbon, bonds, carbon, silicon, bonds, are, longer, and, weaker, the, c, si, bond, is, somewhat, polarised, towards, carbon, due, to, carbon, s, greater, electronegativity, c, 2, 55, vs, si, 1, 90, and, single, bonds, from, si, to, electronegative, elements, are, very, strong, silicon, is, thus, susceptible, to, nucleophilic, attack, by, o, cl, or, f, the, energy, of, an, si, o, bond, in, particular, is, strikingly, high, this, feature, is, exploited, in, many, reactions, such, as, the, sakurai, reaction, the, brook, rearrangement, the, fleming, tamao, oxidation, and, the, peterson, olefination, the, si, c, bond, 1, 89, is, significantly, longer, than, a, typical, c, c, bond, 1, 54, suggesting, that, silyl, substitutents, have, less, steric, demand, than, their, organyl, analogues, when, geometry, allows, silicon, exhibits, negative, hyperconjugation, reversing, the, usual, polarization, on, neighboring, atoms, the, first, organosilicon, compound, tetraethylsilane, was, prepared, by, charles, friedel, and, james, crafts, in, 1863, by, reaction, of, tetrachlorosilane, with, diethylzinc, the, bulk, of, organosilicon, compounds, derive, from, organosilicon, chlorides, ch, 3, 4, x, sicl, x, these, chlorides, are, produced, by, the, direct, process, which, entails, the, reaction, of, methyl, chloride, with, a, silicon, copper, alloy, the, main, and, most, sought, after, product, is, dimethyldichlorosilane, a, variety, of, other, products, are, obtained, including, trimethylsilyl, chloride, and, methyltrichlorosilane, about, 1, million, tons, of, organosilicon, compounds, are, prepared, annually, by, this, route, the, method, can, also, be, used, for, phenyl, chlorosilanes, another, major, method, for, the, formation, of, si, c, bonds, is, hydrosilylation, also, called, hydrosilation, in, this, process, compounds, with, si, h, bonds, hydrosilanes, add, to, unsaturated, substrates, commercially, the, main, substrates, are, alkenes, other, unsaturated, functional, groups, alkynes, imines, ketones, and, aldehydes, also, participate, but, these, reactions, are, of, little, economic, value, hydrosilylation, requires, metal, catalysts, especially, those, based, on, platinum, group, metals, in, the, related, silylmetalation, a, metal, replaces, the, hydrogen, atom, hexamethyldisilane, reacts, with, methyl, lithium, to, give, trimethylsilyl, lithium, similarly, tris, trimethylsilyl, silyl, lithium, is, derived, from, tetrakis, trimethylsilyl, silane, silicon, is, a, component, of, many, functional, groups, most, of, these, are, analogous, to, organic, compounds, the, overarching, exception, is, the, rarity, of, multiple, bonds, to, silicon, as, reflected, in, the, double, bond, rule, silanols, are, analogues, of, alcohols, they, are, generally, prepared, by, hydrolysis, of, silyl, chlorides, less, frequently, silanols, are, prepared, by, oxidation, of, silyl, hydrides, a, reaction, that, uses, a, metal, catalyst, many, silanols, have, been, isolated, including, ch, 3, 3, sioh, and, c, 6, h, 5, 3, sioh, they, are, about, 500x, more, acidic, than, the, corresponding, alcohols, siloxides, are, the, deprotonated, derivatives, of, silanols, silanols, tend, to, dehydrate, to, give, siloxanes, polymers, with, repeating, siloxane, linkages, are, called, silicones, compounds, with, an, si, o, double, bond, called, silanones, are, extremely, unstable, silyl, ethers, have, the, connectivity, si, o, c, they, are, typically, prepared, by, the, reaction, of, alcohols, with, silyl, chlorides, silyl, ethers, are, extensively, used, as, protective, groups, for, alcohols, exploiting, the, strength, of, the, si, f, bond, fluoride, sources, such, as, tetra, n, butylammonium, fluoride, tbaf, are, used, in, deprotection, of, silyl, ethers, organosilyl, chlorides, are, important, commodity, chemicals, they, are, mainly, used, to, produce, silicone, polymers, as, described, above, especially, important, silyl, chlorides, are, dimethyldichlorosilane, me, 2, sicl, 2, methyltrichlorosilane, mesicl, 3, and, trimethylsilyl, chloride, me, 3, sicl, are, all, produced, by, direct, process, more, specialized, derivatives, that, find, commercial, applications, include, dichloromethylphenylsilane, trichloro, chloromethyl, silane, trichloro, dichlorophenyl, silane, trichloroethylsilane, and, phenyltrichlorosilane, although, proportionately, a, minor, outlet, organosilicon, compounds, are, widely, used, in, organic, synthesis, notably, trimethylsilyl, chloride, me, 3, sicl, is, the, main, silylating, agent, one, classic, method, called, the, flood, reaction, for, the, synthesis, of, this, compound, class, is, by, heating, hexaalkyldisiloxanes, r, 3, siosir, 3, with, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, and, a, sodium, halide, the, silicon, to, hydrogen, bond, is, longer, than, the, c, h, bond, 148, compared, to, 105, pm, and, weaker, 299, compared, to, 338, kj, mol, hydrogen, is, more, electronegative, than, silicon, hence, the, naming, convention, of, silyl, hydrides, commonly, the, presence, of, the, hydride, is, not, mentioned, in, the, name, of, the, compound, triethylsilane, has, the, formula, et, 3, sih, phenylsilane, is, phsih, 3, the, parent, compound, sih, 4, is, called, silane, organosilicon, compounds, unlike, their, carbon, counterparts, do, not, have, a, rich, double, bond, chemistry, compounds, with, silene, si, c, bonds, also, known, as, alkylidenesilanes, are, laboratory, curiosities, such, as, the, silicon, benzene, analogue, silabenzene, in, 1967, gusel, nikov, and, flowers, provided, the, first, evidence, for, silenes, from, pyrolysis, of, dimethylsilacyclobutane, the, first, stable, kinetically, shielded, silene, was, reported, in, 1981, by, brook, disilenes, have, si, si, double, bonds, and, disilynes, are, silicon, analogues, of, an, alkyne, the, first, silyne, with, a, silicon, to, carbon, triple, bond, was, reported, in, 2010, siloles, also, called, silacyclopentadienes, are, members, of, a, larger, class, of, compounds, called, metalloles, they, are, the, silicon, analogs, of, cyclopentadienes, and, are, of, current, academic, interest, due, to, their, electroluminescence, and, other, electronic, properties, siloles, are, efficient, in, electron, transport, they, owe, their, low, lying, lumo, to, a, favorable, interaction, between, the, antibonding, sigma, silicon, orbital, with, an, antibonding, pi, orbital, of, the, butadiene, fragment, unlike, carbon, silicon, compounds, can, be, coordinated, to, five, atoms, as, well, in, a, group, of, compounds, ranging, from, so, called, silatranes, such, as, phenylsilatrane, to, a, uniquely, stable, pentaorganosilicate, the, stability, of, hypervalent, silicon, is, the, basis, of, the, hiyama, coupling, a, coupling, reaction, used, in, certain, specialized, organic, synthetic, applications, the, reaction, begins, with, the, activation, of, si, c, bond, by, fluoride, in, general, almost, any, silicon, heteroatom, bond, is, water, sensitive, and, will, spontaneously, hydrolyze, unstrained, silicon, carbon, bonds, however, are, very, strong, and, cleave, only, in, a, small, number, of, extreme, conditions, strong, acids, will, protodesilate, arylsilanes, and, in, the, presence, of, a, lewis, acid, catalyst, alkylsilanes, most, nucleophiles, are, too, weak, to, displace, carbon, from, silicon, the, exceptions, are, fluoride, ions, and, alkoxides, although, the, latter, often, deprotonate, the, organosilane, to, a, silicon, ylide, instead, as, a, covalent, hydride, source, hydrosilanes, are, good, reductants, certain, allyl, silanes, can, be, prepared, from, allylic, esters, such, as, 1, and, monosilylcopper, compounds, which, are, formed, in, situ, by, the, reaction, of, the, disilylzinc, compound, 2, with, copper, iodide, in, in, this, reaction, type, silicon, polarity, is, reversed, in, a, chemical, bond, with, zinc, and, a, formal, allylic, substitution, on, the, benzoyloxy, group, takes, place, unsaturated, silanes, like, the, above, are, susceptible, to, electrophilic, substitution, organosilicon, compounds, affect, bee, and, other, insect, immune, expression, making, them, more, susceptible, to, viral, infection
