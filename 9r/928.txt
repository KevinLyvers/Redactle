magnetostatics, is, the, study, of, magnetic, fields, in, systems, where, the, currents, are, steady, not, changing, with, time, it, is, the, magnetic, analogue, of, electrostatics, where, the, charges, are, stationary, the, magnetization, need, not, be, static, the, equations, of, magnetostatics, can, be, used, to, predict, fast, magnetic, switching, events, that, occur, on, time, scales, of, nanoseconds, or, less, magnetostatics, is, even, a, good, approximation, when, the, currents, are, not, static, as, long, as, the, currents, do, not, alternate, rapidly, magnetostatics, is, widely, used, in, applications, of, micromagnetics, such, as, models, of, magnetic, storage, devices, as, in, computer, memory, starting, from, maxwell, s, equations, and, assuming, that, charges, are, either, fixed, or, move, as, a, steady, current, j, displaystyle, mathbf, j, the, equations, separate, into, two, equations, for, the, electric, field, see, electrostatics, and, two, for, the, magnetic, field, the, fields, are, independent, of, time, and, each, other, the, magnetostatic, equations, in, both, differential, and, integral, forms, are, shown, in, the, table, below, where, with, the, dot, denotes, divergence, and, b, is, the, magnetic, flux, density, the, first, integral, is, over, a, surface, s, displaystyle, s, with, oriented, surface, element, d, s, displaystyle, d, mathbf, s, where, with, the, cross, denotes, curl, j, is, the, current, density, and, h, is, the, magnetic, field, intensity, the, second, integral, is, a, line, integral, around, a, closed, loop, c, displaystyle, c, with, line, element, l, displaystyle, mathbf, l, the, current, going, through, the, loop, is, i, enc, displaystyle, i, text, enc, the, quality, of, this, approximation, may, be, guessed, by, comparing, the, above, equations, with, the, full, version, of, maxwell, s, equations, and, considering, the, importance, of, the, terms, that, have, been, removed, of, particular, significance, is, the, comparison, of, the, j, displaystyle, mathbf, j, term, against, the, d, t, displaystyle, partial, mathbf, d, partial, t, term, if, the, j, displaystyle, mathbf, j, term, is, substantially, larger, then, the, smaller, term, may, be, ignored, without, significant, loss, of, accuracy, a, common, technique, is, to, solve, a, series, of, magnetostatic, problems, at, incremental, time, steps, and, then, use, these, solutions, to, approximate, the, term, b, t, displaystyle, partial, mathbf, b, partial, t, plugging, this, result, into, faraday, s, law, finds, a, value, for, e, displaystyle, mathbf, e, which, had, previously, been, ignored, this, method, is, not, a, true, solution, of, maxwell, s, equations, but, can, provide, a, good, approximation, for, slowly, changing, fields, if, all, currents, in, a, system, are, known, i, e, if, a, complete, description, of, the, current, density, j, r, displaystyle, mathbf, j, mathbf, r, is, available, then, the, magnetic, field, can, be, determined, at, a, position, r, from, the, currents, by, the, biot, savart, equation, 174, b, r, 0, 4, j, r, r, r, r, r, 3, d, 3, r, displaystyle, mathbf, b, mathbf, r, frac, mu, 0, 4, pi, int, frac, mathbf, j, mathbf, r, times, left, mathbf, r, mathbf, r, right, mathbf, r, mathbf, r, 3, mathrm, d, 3, mathbf, r, this, technique, works, well, for, problems, where, the, medium, is, a, vacuum, or, air, or, some, similar, material, with, a, relative, permeability, of, 1, this, includes, air, core, inductors, and, air, core, transformers, one, advantage, of, this, technique, is, that, if, a, coil, has, a, complex, geometry, it, can, be, divided, into, sections, and, the, integral, evaluated, for, each, section, since, this, equation, is, primarily, used, to, solve, linear, problems, the, contributions, can, be, added, for, a, very, difficult, geometry, numerical, integration, may, be, used, for, problems, where, the, dominant, magnetic, material, is, a, highly, permeable, magnetic, core, with, relatively, small, air, gaps, a, magnetic, circuit, approach, is, useful, when, the, air, gaps, are, large, in, comparison, to, the, magnetic, circuit, length, fringing, becomes, significant, and, usually, requires, a, finite, element, calculation, the, finite, element, calculation, uses, a, modified, form, of, the, magnetostatic, equations, above, in, order, to, calculate, magnetic, potential, the, value, of, b, displaystyle, mathbf, b, can, be, found, from, the, magnetic, potential, the, magnetic, field, can, be, derived, from, the, vector, potential, since, the, divergence, of, the, magnetic, flux, density, is, always, zero, b, a, displaystyle, mathbf, b, nabla, times, mathbf, a, and, the, relation, of, the, vector, potential, to, current, is, 176, a, r, 0, 4, j, r, r, r, d, 3, r, displaystyle, mathbf, a, mathbf, r, frac, mu, 0, 4, pi, int, frac, mathbf, j, mathbf, r, mathbf, r, mathbf, r, mathrm, d, 3, mathbf, r, strongly, magnetic, materials, i, e, ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, or, paramagnetic, have, a, magnetization, that, is, primarily, due, to, electron, spin, in, such, materials, the, magnetization, must, be, explicitly, included, using, the, relation, b, 0, m, h, displaystyle, mathbf, b, mu, 0, mathbf, m, mathbf, h, except, in, the, case, of, conductors, electric, currents, can, be, ignored, then, amp, re, s, law, is, simply, h, 0, displaystyle, nabla, times, mathbf, h, 0, this, has, the, general, solution, h, m, displaystyle, mathbf, h, nabla, phi, m, where, m, displaystyle, phi, m, is, a, scalar, potential, 192, substituting, this, in, gauss, s, law, gives, 2, m, m, displaystyle, nabla, 2, phi, m, nabla, cdot, mathbf, m, thus, the, divergence, of, the, magnetization, m, displaystyle, nabla, cdot, mathbf, m, has, a, role, analogous, to, the, electric, charge, in, electrostatics, and, is, often, referred, to, as, an, effective, charge, density, m, displaystyle, rho, m, the, vector, potential, method, can, also, be, employed, with, an, effective, current, density, j, m, m, displaystyle, mathbf, j, m, nabla, times, mathbf, m
