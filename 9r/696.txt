in, physical, geography, tundra, t, n, d, r, t, n, is, a, type, of, biome, where, tree, growth, is, hindered, by, frigid, temperatures, and, short, growing, seasons, there, are, three, regions, and, associated, types, of, tundra, arctic, tundra, alpine, tundra, and, antarctic, tundra, tundra, vegetation, is, composed, of, dwarf, shrubs, sedges, grasses, mosses, and, lichens, scattered, trees, grow, in, some, tundra, regions, the, ecotone, or, ecological, boundary, region, between, the, tundra, and, the, forest, is, known, as, the, tree, line, or, timberline, the, tundra, soil, is, rich, in, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, the, soil, also, contains, large, amounts, of, biomass, and, decomposed, biomass, that, has, been, stored, as, methane, and, carbon, dioxide, in, the, permafrost, making, the, tundra, soil, a, carbon, sink, as, global, warming, heats, the, ecosystem, and, causes, soil, thawing, the, permafrost, carbon, cycle, accelerates, and, releases, much, of, these, soil, contained, greenhouse, gases, into, the, atmosphere, creating, a, feedback, cycle, that, changes, climate, the, term, is, a, russian, word, adapted, from, the, s, mi, languages, tundra, comes, from, the, finnish, word, tunturi, which, refers, to, a, mountain, particularly, in, northern, finland, arctic, tundra, occurs, in, the, far, northern, hemisphere, north, of, the, taiga, belt, the, word, tundra, usually, refers, only, to, the, areas, where, the, subsoil, is, permafrost, or, permanently, frozen, soil, it, may, also, refer, to, the, treeless, plain, in, general, so, that, northern, s, pmi, would, be, included, permafrost, tundra, includes, vast, areas, of, northern, russia, and, canada, the, polar, tundra, is, home, to, several, peoples, who, are, mostly, nomadic, reindeer, herders, such, as, the, nganasan, and, nenets, in, the, permafrost, area, and, the, sami, in, s, pmi, arctic, tundra, contains, areas, of, stark, landscape, and, is, frozen, for, much, of, the, year, the, soil, there, is, frozen, from, 25, to, 90, cm, 10, to, 35, in, down, making, it, impossible, for, trees, to, grow, there, instead, bare, and, sometimes, rocky, land, can, only, support, certain, kinds, of, arctic, vegetation, low, growing, plants, such, as, moss, heath, ericaceae, varieties, such, as, crowberry, and, black, bearberry, and, lichen, there, are, two, main, seasons, winter, and, summer, in, the, polar, tundra, areas, during, the, winter, it, is, very, cold, dark, and, windy, with, the, average, temperature, around, 28, c, 18, f, sometimes, dipping, as, low, as, 50, c, 58, f, however, extreme, cold, temperatures, on, the, tundra, do, not, drop, as, low, as, those, experienced, in, taiga, areas, further, south, for, example, russia, s, canada, s, and, alaska, s, lowest, temperatures, were, recorded, in, locations, south, of, the, tree, line, during, the, summer, temperatures, rise, somewhat, and, the, top, layer, of, seasonally, frozen, soil, melts, leaving, the, ground, very, soggy, the, tundra, is, covered, in, marshes, lakes, bogs, and, streams, during, the, warm, months, generally, daytime, temperatures, during, the, summer, rise, to, about, 12, c, 54, f, but, can, often, drop, to, 3, c, 37, f, or, even, below, freezing, arctic, tundras, are, sometimes, the, subject, of, habitat, conservation, programs, in, canada, and, russia, many, of, these, areas, are, protected, through, a, national, biodiversity, action, plan, tundra, tends, to, be, windy, with, winds, often, blowing, upwards, of, 50, 100, km, h, 30, 60, mph, however, it, is, desert, like, with, only, about, 150, 250, mm, 6, 10, in, of, precipitation, falling, per, year, the, summer, is, typically, the, season, of, maximum, precipitation, although, precipitation, is, light, evaporation, is, also, relatively, minimal, during, the, summer, the, permafrost, thaws, just, enough, to, let, plants, grow, and, reproduce, but, because, the, ground, below, this, is, frozen, the, water, cannot, sink, any, lower, so, the, water, forms, the, lakes, and, marshes, found, during, the, summer, months, there, is, a, natural, pattern, of, accumulation, of, fuel, and, wildfire, which, varies, depending, on, the, nature, of, vegetation, and, terrain, research, in, alaska, has, shown, fire, event, return, intervals, fris, that, typically, vary, from, 150, to, 200, years, with, dryer, lowland, areas, burning, more, frequently, than, wetter, highland, areas, the, biodiversity, of, tundra, is, low, 1, 700, species, of, vascular, plants, and, only, 48, species, of, land, mammals, can, be, found, although, millions, of, birds, migrate, there, each, year, for, the, marshes, there, are, also, a, few, fish, species, there, are, few, species, with, large, populations, notable, plants, in, the, arctic, tundra, include, blueberry, vaccinium, uliginosum, crowberry, empetrum, nigrum, reindeer, lichen, cladonia, rangiferina, lingonberry, vaccinium, vitis, idaea, and, labrador, tea, rhododendron, groenlandicum, notable, animals, include, reindeer, caribou, musk, ox, arctic, hare, arctic, fox, snowy, owl, ptarmigan, northern, red, backed, voles, lemmings, the, mosquito, and, even, polar, bears, near, the, ocean, tundra, is, largely, devoid, of, poikilotherms, such, as, frogs, or, lizards, due, to, the, harsh, climate, of, arctic, tundra, regions, of, this, kind, have, seen, little, human, activity, even, though, they, are, sometimes, rich, in, natural, resources, such, as, petroleum, natural, gas, and, uranium, in, recent, times, this, has, begun, to, change, in, alaska, russia, and, some, other, parts, of, the, world, for, example, the, yamalo, nenets, autonomous, okrug, produces, 90, of, russia, s, natural, gas, a, severe, threat, to, tundra, is, global, warming, which, causes, permafrost, to, thaw, the, thawing, of, the, permafrost, in, a, given, area, on, human, time, scales, decades, or, centuries, could, radically, change, which, species, can, survive, there, it, also, represents, a, significant, risk, to, infrastructure, built, on, top, of, permafrost, such, as, roads, and, pipelines, in, locations, where, dead, vegetation, and, peat, have, accumulated, there, is, a, risk, of, wildfire, such, as, the, 1, 039, km, 2, 401, sq, mi, of, tundra, which, burned, in, 2007, on, the, north, slope, of, the, brooks, range, in, alaska, such, events, may, both, result, from, and, contribute, to, global, warming, carbon, emissions, from, permafrost, thaw, contribute, to, the, same, warming, which, facilitates, the, thaw, making, it, a, positive, climate, change, feedback, the, warming, also, intensifies, arctic, water, cycle, and, the, increased, amounts, of, warmer, rain, are, another, factor, which, increases, permafrost, thaw, depths, the, ipcc, sixth, assessment, report, estimates, that, carbon, dioxide, and, methane, released, from, permafrost, could, amount, to, the, equivalent, of, 14, 175, billion, tonnes, of, carbon, dioxide, per, 1, c, 1, 8, f, of, warming, for, comparison, by, 2019, annual, anthropogenic, emission, of, carbon, dioxide, alone, stood, around, 40, billion, tonnes, a, 2018, perspectives, article, discussing, tipping, points, in, the, climate, system, activated, around, 2, c, 3, 6, f, of, global, warming, suggested, that, at, this, threshold, permafrost, thaw, would, add, a, further, 0, 09, c, 0, 16, f, to, global, temperatures, by, 2100, with, a, range, of, 0, 04, 0, 16, c, 0, 07, 0, 29, f, antarctic, tundra, occurs, on, antarctica, and, on, several, antarctic, and, subantarctic, islands, including, south, georgia, and, the, south, sandwich, islands, and, the, kerguelen, islands, most, of, antarctica, is, too, cold, and, dry, to, support, vegetation, and, most, of, the, continent, is, covered, by, ice, fields, or, cold, deserts, however, some, portions, of, the, continent, particularly, the, antarctic, peninsula, have, areas, of, rocky, soil, that, support, plant, life, the, flora, presently, consists, of, around, 300, 400, species, of, lichens, 100, mosses, 25, liverworts, and, around, 700, terrestrial, and, aquatic, algae, species, which, live, on, the, areas, of, exposed, rock, and, soil, around, the, shore, of, the, continent, antarctica, s, two, flowering, plant, species, the, antarctic, hair, grass, deschampsia, antarctica, and, antarctic, pearlwort, colobanthus, quitensis, are, found, on, the, northern, and, western, parts, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, in, contrast, with, the, arctic, tundra, the, antarctic, tundra, lacks, a, large, mammal, fauna, mostly, due, to, its, physical, isolation, from, the, other, continents, sea, mammals, and, sea, birds, including, seals, and, penguins, inhabit, areas, near, the, shore, and, some, small, mammals, like, rabbits, and, cats, have, been, introduced, by, humans, to, some, of, the, subantarctic, islands, the, antipodes, subantarctic, islands, tundra, ecoregion, includes, the, bounty, islands, auckland, islands, antipodes, islands, the, campbell, island, group, and, macquarie, island, species, endemic, to, this, ecoregion, include, corybas, dienemus, and, corybas, sulcatus, the, only, subantarctic, orchids, the, royal, penguin, and, the, antipodean, albatross, there, is, some, ambiguity, on, whether, magellanic, moorland, on, the, west, coast, of, patagonia, should, be, considered, tundra, or, not, phytogeographer, edmundo, pisano, called, it, tundra, spanish, tundra, magall, nica, since, he, considered, the, low, temperatures, key, to, restrict, plant, growth, more, recent, aproaches, have, since, recognized, it, as, a, temperate, grassland, restricting, southern, tundra, to, coastal, antarctica, and, its, islands, the, flora, and, fauna, of, antarctica, and, the, antarctic, islands, south, of, 60, south, latitude, are, protected, by, the, antarctic, treaty, alpine, tundra, does, not, contain, trees, because, the, climate, and, soils, at, high, altitude, block, tree, growth, 51, the, cold, climate, of, the, alpine, tundra, is, caused, by, the, low, air, temperatures, and, is, similar, to, polar, climate, alpine, tundra, is, generally, better, drained, than, arctic, soils, alpine, tundra, transitions, to, subalpine, forests, below, the, tree, line, stunted, forests, occurring, at, the, forest, tundra, ecotone, the, treeline, are, known, as, krummholz, alpine, tundra, can, be, affected, by, woody, plant, encroachment, alpine, tundra, occurs, in, mountains, worldwide, the, flora, of, the, alpine, tundra, is, characterized, by, plants, that, grow, close, to, the, ground, including, perennial, grasses, sedges, forbs, cushion, plants, mosses, and, lichens, the, flora, is, adapted, to, the, harsh, conditions, of, the, alpine, environment, which, include, low, temperatures, dryness, ultraviolet, radiation, and, a, short, growing, season, tundra, climates, ordinarily, fit, the, k, ppen, climate, classification, et, signifying, a, local, climate, in, which, at, least, one, month, has, an, average, temperature, high, enough, to, melt, snow, 0, c, 32, f, but, no, month, with, an, average, temperature, in, excess, of, 10, c, 50, f, the, cold, limit, generally, meets, the, ef, climates, of, permanent, ice, and, snows, the, warm, summer, limit, generally, corresponds, with, the, poleward, or, altitudinal, limit, of, trees, where, they, grade, into, the, subarctic, climates, designated, dfd, dwd, and, dsd, extreme, winters, as, in, parts, of, siberia, dfc, typical, in, alaska, canada, mountain, areas, of, scandinavia, european, russia, and, western, siberia, cold, winters, with, months, of, freezing, despite, the, potential, diversity, of, climates, in, the, et, category, involving, precipitation, extreme, temperatures, and, relative, wet, and, dry, seasons, this, category, is, rarely, subdivided, rainfall, and, snowfall, are, generally, slight, due, to, the, low, vapor, pressure, of, water, in, the, chilly, atmosphere, but, as, a, rule, potential, evapotranspiration, is, extremely, low, allowing, soggy, terrain, of, swamps, and, bogs, even, in, places, that, get, precipitation, typical, of, deserts, of, lower, and, middle, latitudes, the, amount, of, native, tundra, biomass, depends, more, on, the, local, temperature, than, the, amount, of, precipitation
