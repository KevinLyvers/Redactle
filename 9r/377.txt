germanium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, ge, and, atomic, number, 32, it, is, lustrous, hard, brittle, grayish, white, and, similar, in, appearance, to, silicon, it, is, a, metalloid, more, rarely, considered, a, metal, in, the, carbon, group, that, is, chemically, similar, to, its, group, neighbors, silicon, and, tin, like, silicon, germanium, naturally, reacts, and, forms, complexes, with, oxygen, in, nature, because, it, seldom, appears, in, high, concentration, germanium, was, found, comparatively, late, in, the, discovery, of, the, elements, germanium, ranks, 50th, in, abundance, of, the, elements, in, the, earth, s, crust, in, 1869, dmitri, mendeleev, predicted, its, existence, and, some, of, its, properties, from, its, position, on, his, periodic, table, and, called, the, element, ekasilicon, on, february, 6, 1886, clemens, winkler, at, freiberg, university, found, the, new, element, along, with, silver, and, sulfur, in, the, mineral, argyrodite, winkler, named, the, element, after, his, country, of, birth, germany, germanium, is, mined, primarily, from, sphalerite, the, primary, ore, of, zinc, though, germanium, is, also, recovered, commercially, from, silver, lead, and, copper, ores, elemental, germanium, is, used, as, a, semiconductor, in, transistors, and, various, other, electronic, devices, historically, the, first, decade, of, semiconductor, electronics, was, based, entirely, on, germanium, presently, the, major, end, uses, are, fibre, optic, systems, infrared, optics, solar, cell, applications, and, light, emitting, diodes, leds, germanium, compounds, are, also, used, for, polymerization, catalysts, and, have, most, recently, found, use, in, the, production, of, nanowires, this, element, forms, a, large, number, of, organogermanium, compounds, such, as, tetraethylgermanium, useful, in, organometallic, chemistry, germanium, is, considered, a, technology, critical, element, germanium, is, not, thought, to, be, an, essential, element, for, any, living, organism, similar, to, silicon, and, aluminium, naturally, occurring, germanium, compounds, tend, to, be, insoluble, in, water, and, thus, have, little, oral, toxicity, however, synthetic, soluble, germanium, salts, are, nephrotoxic, and, synthetic, chemically, reactive, germanium, compounds, with, halogens, and, hydrogen, are, irritants, and, toxins, in, his, report, on, the, periodic, law, of, the, chemical, elements, in, 1869, the, russian, chemist, dmitri, mendeleev, predicted, the, existence, of, several, unknown, chemical, elements, including, one, that, would, fill, a, gap, in, the, carbon, family, located, between, silicon, and, tin, because, of, its, position, in, his, periodic, table, mendeleev, called, it, ekasilicon, es, and, he, estimated, its, atomic, weight, to, be, 70, later, 72, in, mid, 1885, at, a, mine, near, freiberg, saxony, a, new, mineral, was, discovered, and, named, argyrodite, because, of, its, high, silver, content, the, chemist, clemens, winkler, analyzed, this, new, mineral, which, proved, to, be, a, combination, of, silver, sulfur, and, a, new, element, winkler, was, able, to, isolate, the, new, element, in, 1886, and, found, it, similar, to, antimony, he, initially, considered, the, new, element, to, be, eka, antimony, but, was, soon, convinced, that, it, was, instead, eka, silicon, before, winkler, published, his, results, on, the, new, element, he, decided, that, he, would, name, his, element, neptunium, since, the, recent, discovery, of, planet, neptune, in, 1846, had, similarly, been, preceded, by, mathematical, predictions, of, its, existence, however, the, name, neptunium, had, already, been, given, to, another, proposed, chemical, element, though, not, the, element, that, today, bears, the, name, neptunium, which, was, discovered, in, 1940, so, instead, winkler, named, the, new, element, germanium, from, the, latin, word, germania, for, germany, in, honor, of, his, homeland, argyrodite, proved, empirically, to, be, ag, 8, ges, 6, because, this, new, element, showed, some, similarities, with, the, elements, arsenic, and, antimony, its, proper, place, in, the, periodic, table, was, under, consideration, but, its, similarities, with, dmitri, mendeleev, s, predicted, element, ekasilicon, confirmed, that, place, on, the, periodic, table, with, further, material, from, 500, kg, of, ore, from, the, mines, in, saxony, winkler, confirmed, the, chemical, properties, of, the, new, element, in, 1887, he, also, determined, an, atomic, weight, of, 72, 32, by, analyzing, pure, germanium, tetrachloride, gecl, 4, while, lecoq, de, boisbaudran, deduced, 72, 3, by, a, comparison, of, the, lines, in, the, spark, spectrum, of, the, element, winkler, was, able, to, prepare, several, new, compounds, of, germanium, including, fluorides, chlorides, sulfides, dioxide, and, tetraethylgermane, ge, c, 2, h, 5, 4, the, first, organogermane, the, physical, data, from, those, compounds, which, corresponded, well, with, mendeleev, s, predictions, made, the, discovery, an, important, confirmation, of, mendeleev, s, idea, of, element, periodicity, here, is, a, comparison, between, the, prediction, and, winkler, s, data, until, the, late, 1930s, germanium, was, thought, to, be, a, poorly, conducting, metal, germanium, did, not, become, economically, significant, until, after, 1945, when, its, properties, as, an, electronic, semiconductor, were, recognized, during, world, war, ii, small, amounts, of, germanium, were, used, in, some, special, electronic, devices, mostly, diodes, the, first, major, use, was, the, point, contact, schottky, diodes, for, radar, pulse, detection, during, the, war, the, first, silicon, germanium, alloys, were, obtained, in, 1955, before, 1945, only, a, few, hundred, kilograms, of, germanium, were, produced, in, smelters, each, year, but, by, the, end, of, the, 1950s, the, annual, worldwide, production, had, reached, 40, metric, tons, 44, short, tons, the, development, of, the, germanium, transistor, in, 1948, opened, the, door, to, countless, applications, of, solid, state, electronics, from, 1950, through, the, early, 1970s, this, area, provided, an, increasing, market, for, germanium, but, then, high, purity, silicon, began, replacing, germanium, in, transistors, diodes, and, rectifiers, for, example, the, company, that, became, fairchild, semiconductor, was, founded, in, 1957, with, the, express, purpose, of, producing, silicon, transistors, silicon, has, superior, electrical, properties, but, it, requires, much, greater, purity, that, could, not, be, commercially, achieved, in, the, early, years, of, semiconductor, electronics, meanwhile, the, demand, for, germanium, for, fiber, optic, communication, networks, infrared, night, vision, systems, and, polymerization, catalysts, increased, dramatically, these, end, uses, represented, 85, of, worldwide, germanium, consumption, in, 2000, the, us, government, even, designated, germanium, as, a, strategic, and, critical, material, calling, for, a, 146, ton, 132, tonne, supply, in, the, national, defense, stockpile, in, 1987, germanium, differs, from, silicon, in, that, the, supply, is, limited, by, the, availability, of, exploitable, sources, while, the, supply, of, silicon, is, limited, only, by, production, capacity, since, silicon, comes, from, ordinary, sand, and, quartz, while, silicon, could, be, bought, in, 1998, for, less, than, 10, per, kg, the, price, of, germanium, was, almost, 800, per, kg, under, standard, conditions, germanium, is, a, brittle, silvery, white, semiconductor, this, form, constitutes, an, allotrope, known, as, germanium, which, has, a, metallic, luster, and, a, diamond, cubic,

emerging, as, an, important, material, for, spintronics, and, spin, based, quantum, computing, applications, in, 2010, researchers, demonstrated, room, temperature, spin, transport, and, more, recently, donor, electron, spins, in, germanium, has, been, shown, to, have, very, long, coherence, times, due, to, its, use, in, advanced, electronics, and, optics, germanium, is, considered, a, technology, critical, element, by, e, g, the, european, union, essential, to, fulfill, the, green, and, digital, transition, as, china, controls, 60, of, global, germanium, production, it, holds, a, dominant, position, over, the, world, s, supply, chains, on, 3, july, 2023, china, suddenly, imposed, restrictions, on, the, exports, of, germanium, and, gallium, ratcheting, up, trade, tensions, with, western, allies, invoking, national, security, interests, the, chinese, ministry, of, commerce, informed, that, companies, that, intend, to, sell, products, containing, germanium, would, need, an, export, licence, the, products, compounds, targeted, are, germanium, dioxide, germanium, epitaxial, growth, substrate, germanium, ingot, germanium, metal, germanium, tetrachloride, and, zinc, germanium, phosphide, it, sees, such, products, as, dual, use, items, that, may, have, military, purposes, and, therefore, warrant, an, extra, layer, of, oversight, the, new, dispute, opened, a, new, chapter, in, the, increasingly, fierce, technology, race, that, has, pitted, the, united, states, and, to, a, lesser, extent, europe, against, china, the, us, wants, its, allies, to, heavily, curb, or, downright, prohibit, advanced, electronic, components, bound, to, the, chinese, market, in, order, to, prevent, beijing, from, securing, global, technology, supremacy, china, denied, any, tit, for, tat, intention, behind, the, germanium, export, restrictions, following, china, s, export, restrictions, russian, state, owned, company, rostec, announced, an, increase, in, germanium, production, to, meet, domestic, demand, germanium, is, not, considered, essential, to, the, health, of, plants, or, animals, germanium, in, the, environment, has, little, or, no, health, impact, this, is, primarily, because, it, usually, occurs, only, as, a, trace, element, in, ores, and, carbonaceous, materials, and, the, various, industrial, and, electronic, applications, involve, very, small, quantities, that, are, not, likely, to, be, ingested, for, similar, reasons, end, use, germanium, has, little, impact, on, the, environment, as, a, biohazard, some, reactive, intermediate, compounds, of, germanium, are, poisonous, see, precautions, below, germanium, supplements, made, from, both, organic, and, inorganic, germanium, have, been, marketed, as, an, alternative, medicine, capable, of, treating, leukemia, and, lung, cancer, there, is, however, no, medical, evidence, of, benefit, some, evidence, suggests, that, such, supplements, are, actively, harmful, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, fda, research, has, concluded, that, inorganic, germanium, when, used, as, a, nutritional, supplement, presents, potential, human, health, hazard, some, germanium, compounds, have, been, administered, by, alternative, medical, practitioners, as, non, fda, allowed, injectable, solutions, soluble, inorganic, forms, of, germanium, used, at, first, notably, the, citrate, lactate, salt, resulted, in, some, cases, of, renal, dysfunction, hepatic, steatosis, and, peripheral, neuropathy, in, individuals, using, them, over, a, long, term, plasma, and, urine, germanium, concentrations, in, these, individuals, several, of, whom, died, were, several, orders, of, magnitude, greater, than, endogenous, levels, a, more, recent, organic, form, beta, carboxyethylgermanium, sesquioxide, propagermanium, has, not, exhibited, the, same, spectrum, of, toxic, effects, certain, compounds, of, germanium, have, low, toxicity, to, mammals, but, have, toxic, effects, against, certain, bacteria, while, use, of, germanium, itself, does, not, require, precautions, some, of, germanium, s, artificially, produced, compounds, are, quite, reactive, and, present, an, immediate, hazard, to, human, health, on, exposure, for, example, germanium, tetrachloride, and, germane, geh, 4, are, a, liquid, and, gas, respectively, that, can, be, very, irritating, to, the, eyes, skin, lungs, and, throat
