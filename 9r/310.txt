in, chemistry, a, reaction, mechanism, is, the, step, by, step, sequence, of, elementary, reactions, by, which, overall, chemical, reaction, occurs, a, chemical, mechanism, is, a, theoretical, conjecture, that, tries, to, describe, in, detail, what, takes, place, at, each, stage, of, an, overall, chemical, reaction, the, detailed, steps, of, a, reaction, are, not, observable, in, most, cases, the, conjectured, mechanism, is, chosen, because, it, is, thermodynamically, feasible, and, has, experimental, support, in, isolated, intermediates, see, next, section, or, other, quantitative, and, qualitative, characteristics, of, the, reaction, it, also, describes, each, reactive, intermediate, activated, complex, and, transition, state, which, bonds, are, broken, and, in, what, order, and, which, bonds, are, formed, and, in, what, order, a, complete, mechanism, must, also, explain, the, reason, for, the, reactants, and, catalyst, used, the, stereochemistry, observed, in, reactants, and, products, all, products, formed, and, the, amount, of, each, the, electron, or, arrow, pushing, method, is, often, used, in, illustrating, a, reaction, mechanism, for, example, see, the, illustration, of, the, mechanism, for, benzoin, condensation, in, the, following, examples, section, a, reaction, mechanism, must, also, account, for, the, order, in, which, molecules, react, often, what, appears, to, be, a, single, step, conversion, is, in, fact, a, multistep, reaction, reaction, intermediates, are, chemical, species, often, unstable, and, short, lived, however, sometimes, can, be, isolated, which, are, not, reactants, or, products, of, the, overall, chemical, reaction, but, are, temporary, products, and, or, reactants, in, the, mechanism, s, reaction, steps, reaction, intermediates, are, often, free, radicals, or, ions, reaction, intermediates, are, often, confused, with, the, transition, state, the, transition, state, is, a, fleeting, high, energy, configuration, that, exists, only, at, the, peak, of, the, energy, barrier, during, a, reaction, while, a, reaction, intermediate, is, a, relatively, stable, species, that, exists, for, a, measurable, time, between, steps, in, a, reaction, unlike, the, transition, state, intermediates, can, sometimes, be, isolated, or, observed, directly, the, kinetics, relative, rates, of, the, reaction, steps, and, the, rate, equation, for, the, overall, reaction, are, explained, in, terms, of, the, energy, needed, for, the, conversion, of, the, reactants, to, the, proposed, transition, states, molecular, states, that, correspond, to, maxima, on, the, reaction, coordinates, and, to, saddle, points, on, the, potential, energy, surface, for, the, reaction, information, about, the, mechanism, of, a, reaction, is, often, provided, by, the, use, of, chemical, kinetics, to, determine, the, rate, equation, and, the, reaction, order, in, each, reactant, consider, the, following, reaction, for, example, in, this, case, experiments, have, determined, that, this, reaction, takes, place, according, to, the, rate, law, r, k, n, o, 2, 2, displaystyle, r, k, 2, this, form, suggests, that, the, rate, determining, step, is, a, reaction, between, two, molecules, of, no, 2, a, possible, mechanism, for, the, overall, reaction, that, explains, the, rate, law, is, each, step, is, called, an, elementary, step, and, each, has, its, own, rate, law, and, molecularity, the, elementary, steps, should, add, up, to, the, original, reaction, meaning, if, we, were, to, cancel, out, all, the, molecules, that, appear, on, both, sides, of, the, reaction, we, would, be, left, with, the, original, reaction, when, determining, the, overall, rate, law, for, a, reaction, the, slowest, step, is, the, step, that, determines, the, reaction, rate, because, the, first, step, in, the, above, reaction, is, the, slowest, step, it, is, the, rate, determining, step, because, it, involves, the, collision, of, two, no, 2, molecules, it, is, a, bimolecular, reaction, with, a, rate, r, displaystyle, r, which, obeys, the, rate, law, r, k, n, o, 2, t, 2, displaystyle, r, k, 2, other, reactions, may, have, mechanisms, of, several, consecutive, steps, in, organic, chemistry, the, reaction, mechanism, for, the, benzoin, condensation, put, forward, in, 1903, by, a, j, lapworth, was, one, of, the, first, proposed, reaction, mechanisms, a, chain, reaction, is, an, example, of, a, complex, mechanism, in, which, the, propagation, steps, form, a, closed, cycle, in, a, chain, reaction, the, intermediate, produced, in, one, step, generates, an, intermediate, in, another, step, intermediates, are, called, chain, carriers, sometimes, the, chain, carriers, are, radicals, they, can, be, ions, as, well, in, nuclear, fission, they, are, neutrons, chain, reactions, have, several, steps, which, may, include, even, though, all, these, steps, can, appear, in, one, chain, reaction, the, minimum, necessary, ones, are, initiation, propagation, and, termination, an, example, of, a, simple, chain, reaction, is, the, thermal, decomposition, of, acetaldehyde, ch, 3, cho, to, methane, ch, 4, and, carbon, monoxide, co, the, experimental, reaction, order, is, 3, 2, which, can, be, explained, by, a, rice, herzfeld, mechanism, this, reaction, mechanism, for, acetaldehyde, has, 4, steps, with, rate, equations, for, each, step, for, the, overall, reaction, the, rates, of, change, of, the, concentration, of, the, intermediates, ch, 3, and, ch, 3, co, are, zero, according, to, the, steady, state, approximation, which, is, used, to, account, for, the, rate, laws, of, chain, reactions, d, dt, k, 1, k, 2, k, 3, 2k, 4, 2, 0, and, d, dt, k, 2, k, 3, 0, the, sum, of, these, two, equations, is, k, 1, 2, k, 4, 2, 0, this, may, be, solved, to, find, the, steady, state, concentration, of, ch, 3, radicals, as, k, 1, 2k, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, it, follows, that, the, rate, of, formation, of, ch, 4, is, d, dt, k, 2, k, 2, k, 1, 2k, 4, 1, 2, 3, 2, thus, the, mechanism, explains, the, observed, rate, expression, for, the, principal, products, ch, 4, and, co, the, exact, rate, law, may, be, even, more, complicated, there, are, also, minor, products, such, as, acetone, ch, 3, coch, 3, and, propanal, ch, 3, ch, 2, cho, many, experiments, that, suggest, the, possible, sequence, of, steps, in, a, reaction, mechanism, have, been, designed, including, a, correct, reaction, mechanism, is, an, important, part, of, accurate, predictive, modeling, for, many, combustion, and, plasma, systems, detailed, mechanisms, are, not, available, or, require, development, even, when, information, is, available, identifying, and, assembling, the, relevant, data, from, a, variety, of, sources, reconciling, discrepant, values, and, extrapolating, to, different, conditions, can, be, a, difficult, process, without, expert, help, rate, constants, or, thermochemical, data, are, often, not, available, in, the, literature, so, computational, chemistry, techniques, or, group, additivity, methods, must, be, used, to, obtain, the, required, parameters, computational, chemistry, methods, can, also, be, used, to, calculate, potential, energy, surfaces, for, reactions, and, determine, probable, mechanisms, molecularity, in, chemistry, is, the, number, of, colliding, molecular, entities, that, are, involved, in, a, single, reaction, step, in, general, reaction, steps, involving, more, than, three, molecular, entities, do, not, occur, because, is, statistically, improbable, in, terms, of, maxwell, distribution, to, find, such, a, transition, state, l, g, wade, organic, chemistry, 7th, ed, 2010
