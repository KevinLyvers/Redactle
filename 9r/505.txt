acetic, acid, s, i, t, k, systematically, named, ethanoic, acid, n, o, k, is, an, acidic, colourless, liquid, and, organic, compound, with, the, chemical, formula, ch, 3, cooh, also, written, as, ch, 3, co, 2, h, c, 2, h, 4, o, 2, or, hc, 2, h, 3, o, 2, vinegar, is, at, least, 4, acetic, acid, by, volume, making, acetic, acid, the, main, component, of, vinegar, apart, from, water, it, has, been, used, as, a, component, of, vinegar, throughout, history, from, at, least, the, third, century, bc, acetic, acid, is, also, known, as, acetyl, hydroxide, acoh, acetic, acid, is, the, second, simplest, carboxylic, acid, after, formic, acid, it, is, an, important, chemical, reagent, and, industrial, chemical, across, various, fields, used, primarily, in, the, production, of, cellulose, acetate, for, photographic, film, polyvinyl, acetate, for, wood, glue, and, synthetic, fibres, and, fabrics, in, households, diluted, acetic, acid, is, often, used, in, descaling, agents, in, the, food, industry, acetic, acid, is, controlled, by, the, food, additive, code, e260, as, an, acidity, regulator, and, as, a, condiment, in, biochemistry, the, acetyl, group, derived, from, acetic, acid, is, fundamental, to, all, forms, of, life, when, bound, to, coenzyme, a, it, is, central, to, the, metabolism, of, carbohydrates, and, fats, the, global, demand, for, acetic, acid, as, of, 2023, is, about, 17, 88, million, metric, tonnes, per, year, t, a, most, of, the, world, s, acetic, acid, is, produced, via, the, carbonylation, of, methanol, its, production, and, subsequent, industrial, use, poses, health, hazards, to, workers, including, incidental, skin, damage, and, chronic, respiratory, injuries, from, inhalation, the, trivial, name, acetic, acid, is, the, most, commonly, used, and, preferred, iupac, name, the, systematic, name, ethanoic, acid, a, valid, iupac, name, is, constructed, according, to, the, substitutive, nomenclature, the, name, acetic, acid, derives, from, the, latin, word, for, vinegar, acetum, which, is, related, to, the, word, acid, itself, glacial, acetic, acid, is, a, name, for, water, free, anhydrous, acetic, acid, similar, to, the, german, name, eisessig, ice, vinegar, the, name, comes, from, the, solid, ice, like, crystals, that, form, with, agitation, slightly, below, room, temperature, at, 16, 6, c, 61, 9, f, acetic, acid, can, never, be, truly, water, free, in, an, atmosphere, that, contains, water, so, the, presence, of, 0, 1, water, in, glacial, acetic, acid, lowers, its, melting, point, by, 0, 2, c, a, common, symbol, for, acetic, acid, is, acoh, or, hoac, where, ac, is, the, pseudoelement, symbol, representing, the, acetyl, group, ch, 3, c, o, the, conjugate, base, acetate, ch, 3, coo, is, thus, represented, as, aco, acetate, is, the, ion, resulting, from, loss, of, h, from, acetic, acid, the, name, acetate, can, also, refer, to, a, salt, containing, this, anion, or, an, ester, of, acetic, acid, the, symbol, ac, for, the, acetyl, functional, group, is, not, to, be, confused, with, the, symbol, ac, for, the, element, actinium, context, prevents, confusion, among, organic, chemists, to, better, reflect, its, structure, acetic, acid, is, often, written, as, ch, 3, c, o, oh, ch, 3, c, o, oh, ch, 3, cooh, and, ch, 3, co, 2, h, in, the, context, of, acid, base, reactions, the, abbreviation, hac, is, sometimes, used, where, ac, in, this, case, is, a, symbol, for, acetate, rather, than, acetyl, the, carboxymethyl, functional, group, derived, from, removing, one, hydrogen, from, the, methyl, group, of, acetic, acid, has, the, chemical, formula, ch, 2, c, o, oh, vinegar, was, known, early, in, civilization, as, the, natural, result, of, exposure, of, beer, and, wine, to, air, because, acetic, acid, producing, bacteria, are, present, globally, the, use, of, acetic, acid, in, alchemy, extends, into, the, third, century, bc, when, the, greek, philosopher, theophrastus, described, how, vinegar, acted, on, metals, to, produce, pigments, useful, in, art, including, white, lead, lead, carbonate, and, verdigris, a, green, mixture, of, copper, salts, including, copper, ii, acetate, ancient, romans, boiled, soured, wine, to, produce, a, highly, sweet, syrup, called, sapa, sapa, that, was, produced, in, lead, pots, was, rich, in, lead, acetate, a, sweet, substance, also, called, sugar, of, lead, or, sugar, of, saturn, which, contributed, to, lead, poisoning, among, the, roman, aristocracy, in, the, 16th, century, german, alchemist, andreas, libavius, described, the, production, of, acetone, from, the, dry, distillation, of, lead, acetate, ketonic, decarboxylation, the, presence, of, water, in, vinegar, has, such, a, profound, effect, on, acetic, acid, s, properties, that, for, centuries, chemists, believed, that, glacial, acetic, acid, and, the, acid, found, in, vinegar, were, two, different, substances, french, chemist, pierre, adet, proved, them, identical, in, 1845, german, chemist, hermann, kolbe, synthesised, acetic, acid, from, inorganic, compounds, for, the, first, time, this, reaction, sequence, consisted, of, chlorination, of, carbon, disulfide, to, carbon, tetrachloride, followed, by, pyrolysis, to, tetrachloroethylene, and, aqueous, chlorination, to, trichloroacetic, acid, and, concluded, with, electrolytic, reduction, to, acetic, acid, by, 1910, most, glacial, acetic, acid, was, obtained, from, the, pyroligneous, liquor, a, product, of, the, distillation, of, wood, the, acetic, acid, was, isolated, by, treatment, with, milk, of, lime, and, the, resulting, calcium, acetate, was, then, acidified, with, sulfuric, acid, to, recover, acetic, acid, at, that, time, germany, was, producing, 10, 000, tons, of, glacial, acetic, acid, around, 30, of, which, was, used, for, the, manufacture, of, indigo, dye, because, both, methanol, and, carbon, monoxide, are, commodity, raw, materials, methanol, carbonylation, long, appeared, to, be, attractive, precursors, to, acetic, acid, henri, dreyfus, at, british, celanese, developed, a, methanol, carbonylation, pilot, plant, as, early, as, 1925, however, a, lack, of, practical, materials, that, could, contain, the, corrosive, reaction, mixture, at, the, high, pressures, needed, 200, atm, or, more, discouraged, commercialization, of, these, routes, the, first, commercial, methanol, carbonylation, process, which, used, a, cobalt, catalyst, was, developed, by, german, chemical, company, basf, in, 1963, in, 1968, a, rhodium, based, catalyst, cis, was, discovered, that, could, operate, efficiently, at, lower, pressure, with, almost, no, by, products, us, chemical, company, monsanto, company, built, the, first, plant, using, this, catalyst, in, 1970, and, rhodium, catalyzed, methanol, carbonylation, became, the, dominant, method, of, acetic, acid, production, see, monsanto, process, in, the, late, 1990s, bp, chemicals, commercialised, the, cativa, catalyst, which, is, promoted, by, iridium, for, greater, efficiency, known, as, the, cativa, process, the, iridium, catalyzed, production, of, glacial, acetic, acid, is, greener, and, has, largely, supplanted, the, monsanto, process, often, in, the, same, production, plants, interstellar, acetic, acid, was, discovered, in, 1996, by, a, team, led, by, david, mehringer, using, the, former, berkeley, illinois, maryland, association, array, at, the, hat, creek, radio, observatory, and, the, former, millimeter, array, located, at, the, owens, valley, radio, observatory, it, was, first, detected, in, the, sagittarius, b2, north, molecular, cloud, also, known, as, the, sgr, b2, large, molecule, heimat, source, acetic, acid, has, the, distinction, of, being, the, first, molecule, discovered, in, the, interstellar, medium, using, solely, radio, interferometers, in, all, previous, ism, molecular, discoveries, made, in, the, millimetre, and, centimetre, wavelength, regimes, single, dish, radio, telescopes, were, at, least, partly, responsible, for, the, detections, the, hydrogen, centre, in, the, carboxyl, group, cooh, in, carboxylic, acids, such, as, acetic, acid, can, separate, from, the, molecule, by, ionization, because, of, this, release, of, the, proton, h, acetic, acid, has, acidic, character, acetic, acid, is, a, weak, monoprotic, acid, in, aqueous, solution, it, has, a, pk, a, value, of, 4, 76, its, conjugate, base, is, acetate, ch, 3, coo, a, 1, 0, m, solution, about, the, concentration, of, domestic, vinegar, has, a, ph, of, 2, 4, indicating, that, merely, 0, 4, of, the, acetic, acid, molecules, are, dissociated, only, in, very, dilute, 10, 6, m, solution, acetic, acid, is, 90, dissociated, in, solid, acetic, acid, the, molecules, form, chains, of, individual, molecules, interconnected, by, hydrogen, bonds, in, the, vapour, phase, at, 120, c, 248, f, dimers, can, be, detected, dimers, also, occur, in, the, liquid, phase, in, dilute, solutions, with, non, hydrogen, bonding, solvents, and, to, a, certain, extent, in, pure, acetic, acid, but, are, disrupted, by, hydrogen, bonding, solvents, the, dissociation, enthalpy, of, the, dimer, is, estimated, at, 65, 0, 66, 0, kj, mol, and, the, dissociation, entropy, at, 154, 157, j, mol, 1, k, 1, other, carboxylic, acids, engage, in, similar, intermolecular, hydrogen, bonding, interactions, liquid, acetic, acid, is, a, hydrophilic, polar, protic, solvent, similar, to, ethanol, and, water, with, a, relative, static, permittivity, dielectric, constant, of, 6, 2, it, dissolves, not, only, polar, compounds, such, as, inorganic, salts, and, sugars, but, also, non, polar, compounds, such, as, oils, as, well, as, polar, solutes, it, is, miscible, with, polar, and, non, polar, solvents, such, as, water, chloroform, and, hexane, with, higher, alkanes, starting, with, octane, acetic, acid, is, not, miscible, at, all, compositions, and, solubility, of, acetic, acid, in, alkanes, declines, with, longer, n, alkanes, the, solvent, and, miscibility, properties, of, acetic, acid, make, it, a, useful, industrial, chemical, for, example, as, a, solvent, in, the, production, of, dimethyl, terephthalate, at, physiological, phs, acetic, acid, is, usually, fully, ionised, to, acetate, the, acetyl, group, formally, derived, from, acetic, acid, is, fundamental, to, all, forms, of, life, typically, it, is, bound, to, coenzyme, a, by, acetyl, coa, synthetase, enzymes, where, it, is, central, to, the, metabolism, of, carbohydrates, and, fats, unlike, longer, chain, carboxylic, acids, the, fatty, acids, acetic, acid, does, not, occur, in, natural, triglycerides, most, of, the, acetate, generated, in, cells, for, use, in, acetyl, coa, is, synthesized, directly, from, ethanol, or, pyruvate, however, the, artificial, triglyceride, triacetin, glycerine, triacetate, is, a, common, food, additive, and, is, found, in, cosmetics, and, topical, medicines, this, additive, is, metabolized, to, glycerol, and, acetic, acid, in, the, body, acetic, acid, is, produced, and, excreted, by, acetic, acid, bacteria, notably, the, genus, acetobacter, and, clostridium, acetobutylicum, these, bacteria, are, found, universally, in, foodstuffs, water, and, soil, and, acetic, acid, is, produced, naturally, as, fruits, and, other, foods, spoil, acetic, acid, is, also, a, component, of, the, vaginal, lubrication, of, humans, and, other, primates, where, it, appears, to, serve, as, a, mild, antibacterial, agent, acetic, acid, is, produced, industrially, both, synthetically, and, by, bacterial, fermentation, about, 75, of, acetic, acid, made, for, use, in, the, chemical, industry, is, made, by, the, carbonylation, of, methanol, explained, below, the, biological, route, accounts, for, only, about, 10, of, world, production, but, it, remains, important, for, the, production, of, vinegar, because, many, food, purity, laws, require, vinegar, used, in, foods, to, be, of, biological, origin, other, processes, are, methyl, formate, isomerization, conversion, of, syngas, to, acetic, acid, and, gas, phase, oxidation, of, ethylene, and, ethanol, acetic, acid, can, be, purified, via, fractional, freezing, using, an, ice, bath, the, water, and, other, impurities, will, remain, liquid, while, the, acetic, acid, will, precipitate, out, as, of, 2003, 2005, total, worldwide, production, of, virgin, acetic, acid, was, estimated, at, 5, mt, a, million, tonnes, per, year, approximately, half, of, which, was, produced, in, the, united, states, european, production, was, approximately, 1, mt, a, and, declining, while, japanese, production, was, 0, 7, mt, a, another, 1, 5, mt, were, recycled, each, year, bringing, the, total, world, market, to, 6, 5, mt, a, since, then, the, global, production, has, increased, from, 10, 7, mt, a, in, 2010, to, 17, 88, mt, a, in, 2023, the, two, biggest, producers, of, virgin, acetic, acid, are, celanese, and, bp, chemicals, other, major, producers, include, millennium, chemicals, sterling, chemicals, samsung, eastman, and, svensk, etanolkemi, most, acetic, acid, is, produced, by, methanol, carbonylation, in, this, process, methanol, and, carbon, monoxide, react, to, produce, acetic, acid, according, to, the, equation, the, process, involves, iodomethane, as, an, intermediate, and, occurs, in, three, steps, a, metal, carbonyl, catalyst, is, needed, for, the, carbonylation, step, 2, two, related, processes, exist, for, the, carbonylation, of, methanol, the, rhodium, catalyzed, monsanto, process, and, the, iridium, catalyzed, cativa, process, the, latter, process, is, greener, and, more, efficient, and, has, largely, supplanted, the, former, process, catalytic, amounts, of, water, are, used, in, both, processes, but, the, cativa, process, requires, less, so, the, water, gas, shift, reaction, is, suppressed, and, fewer, by, products, are, formed, by, altering, the, process, conditions, acetic, anhydride, may, also, be, produced, in, plants, using, rhodium, catalysis, prior, to, the, commercialization, of, the, monsanto, process, most, acetic, acid, was, produced, by, oxidation, of, acetaldehyde, this, remains, the, second, most, important, manufacturing, method, although, it, is, usually, not, competitive, with, the, carbonylation, of, methanol, the, acetaldehyde, can, be, produced, by, hydration, of, acetylene, this, was, the, dominant, technology, in, the, early, 1900s, light, naphtha, components, are, readily, oxidized, by, oxygen, or, even, air, to, give, peroxides, which, decompose, to, produce, acetic, acid, according, to, the, chemical, equation, illustrated, with, butane, such, oxidations, require, metal, catalyst, such, as, the, naphthenate, salts, of, manganese, cobalt, and, chromium, the, typical, reaction, is, conducted, at, temperatures, and, pressures, designed, to, be, as, hot, as, possible, while, still, keeping, the, butane, a, liquid, typical, reaction, conditions, are, 150, c, 302, f, and, 55, atm, side, products, may, also, form, including, butanone, ethyl, acetate, formic, acid, and, propionic, acid, these, side, products, are, also, commercially, valuable, and, the, reaction, conditions, may, be, altered, to, produce, more, of, them, where, needed, however, the, separation, of, acetic, acid, from, these, by, products, adds, to, the, cost, of, the, process, similar, conditions, and, catalysts, are, used, for, butane, oxidation, the, oxygen, in, air, to, produce, acetic, acid, can, oxidize, acetaldehyde, using, modern, catalysts, this, reaction, can, have, an, acetic, acid, yield, greater, than, 95, the, major, side, products, are, ethyl, acetate, formic, acid, and, formaldehyde, all, of, which, have, lower, boiling, points, than, acetic, acid, and, are, readily, separated, by, distillation, acetaldehyde, may, be, prepared, from, ethylene, via, the, wacker, process, and, then, oxidised, as, above, in, more, recent, times, chemical, company, showa, denko, which, opened, an, ethylene, oxidation, plant, in, ita, japan, in, 1997, commercialised, a, cheaper, single, stage, conversion, of, ethylene, to, acetic, acid, the, process, is, catalyzed, by, a, palladium, metal, catalyst, supported, on, a, heteropoly, acid, such, as, silicotungstic, acid, a, similar, process, uses, the, same, metal, catalyst, on, silicotungstic, acid, and, silica, it, is, thought, to, be, competitive, with, methanol, carbonylation, for, smaller, plants, 100, 250, kt, a, depending, on, the, local, price, of, ethylene, for, most, of, human, history, acetic, acid, bacteria, of, the, genus, acetobacter, have, made, acetic, acid, in, the, form, of, vinegar, given, sufficient, oxygen, these, bacteria, can, produce, vinegar, from, a, variety, of, alcoholic, foodstuffs, commonly, used, feeds, include, apple, cider, wine, and, fermented, grain, malt, rice, or, potato, mashes, the, overall, chemical, reaction, facilitated, by, these, bacteria, is, a, dilute, alcohol, solution, inoculated, with, acetobacter, and, kept, in, a, warm, airy, place, will, become, vinegar, over, the, course, of, a, few, months, industrial, vinegar, making, methods, accelerate, this, process, by, improving, the, supply, of, oxygen, to, the, bacteria, the, first, batches, of, vinegar, produced, by, fermentation, probably, followed, errors, in, the, winemaking, process, if, must, is, fermented, at, too, high, a, temperature, acetobacter, will, overwhelm, the, yeast, naturally, occurring, on, the, grapes, as, the, demand, for, vinegar, for, culinary, medical, and, sanitary, purposes, increased, vintners, quickly, learned, to, use, other, organic, materials, to, produce, vinegar, in, the, hot, summer, months, before, the, grapes, were, ripe, and, ready, for, processing, into, wine, this, method, was, slow, however, and, not, always, successful, as, the, vintners, did, not, understand, the, process, one, of, the, first, modern, commercial, processes, was, the, fast, method, or, german, method, first, practised, in, germany, in, 1823, in, this, process, fermentation, takes, place, in, a, tower, packed, with, wood, shavings, or, charcoal, the, alcohol, containing, feed, is, trickled, into, the, top, of, the, tower, and, fresh, air, supplied, from, the, bottom, by, either, natural, or, forced, convection, the, improved, air, supply, in, this, process, cut, the, time, to, prepare, vinegar, from, months, to, weeks, nowadays, most, vinegar, is, made, in, submerged, tank, culture, first, described, in, 1949, by, otto, hromatka, and, heinrich, ebner, in, this, method, alcohol, is, fermented, to, vinegar, in, a, continuously, stirred, tank, and, oxygen, is, supplied, by, bubbling, air, through, the, solution, using, modern, applications, of, this, method, vinegar, of, 15, acetic, acid, can, be, prepared, in, only, 24, hours, in, batch, process, even, 20, in, 60, hour, fed, batch, process, species, of, anaerobic, bacteria, including, members, of, the, genus, clostridium, or, acetobacterium, can, convert, sugars, to, acetic, acid, directly, without, creating, ethanol, as, an, intermediate, the, overall, chemical, reaction, conducted, by, these, bacteria, may, be, represented, as, these, acetogenic, bacteria, produce, acetic, acid, from, one, carbon, compounds, including, methanol, carbon, monoxide, or, a, mixture, of, carbon, dioxide, and, hydrogen, this, ability, of, clostridium, to, metabolize, sugars, directly, or, to, produce, acetic, acid, from, less, costly, inputs, suggests, that, these, bacteria, could, produce, acetic, acid, more, efficiently, than, ethanol, oxidizers, like, acetobacter, however, clostridium, bacteria, are, less, acid, tolerant, than, acetobacter, even, the, most, acid, tolerant, clostridium, strains, can, produce, vinegar, in, concentrations, of, only, a, few, per, cent, compared, to, acetobacter, strains, that, can, produce, vinegar, in, concentrations, up, to, 20, at, present, it, remains, more, cost, effective, to, produce, vinegar, using, acetobacter, rather, than, using, clostridium, and, concentrating, it, as, a, result, although, acetogenic, bacteria, have, been, known, since, 1940, their, industrial, use, is, confined, to, a, few, niche, applications, acetic, acid, is, a, chemical, reagent, for, the, production, of, chemical, compounds, the, largest, single, use, of, acetic, acid, is, in, the, production, of, vinyl, acetate, monomer, closely, followed, by, acetic, anhydride, and, ester, production, the, volume, of, acetic, acid, used, in, vinegar, is, comparatively, small, the, primary, use, of, acetic, acid, is, the, production, of, vinyl, acetate, monomer, vam, in, 2008, this, application, was, estimated, to, consume, a, third, of, the, world, s, production, of, acetic, acid, the, reaction, consists, of, ethylene, and, acetic, acid, with, oxygen, over, a, palladium, catalyst, conducted, in, the, gas, phase, vinyl, acetate, can, be, polymerised, to, polyvinyl, acetate, or, other, polymers, which, are, components, in, paints, and, adhesives, the, major, esters, of, acetic, acid, are, commonly, used, as, solvents, for, inks, paints, and, coatings, the, esters, include, ethyl, acetate, n, butyl, acetate, isobutyl, acetate, and, propyl, acetate, they, are, typically, produced, by, catalyzed, reaction, from, acetic, acid, and, the, corresponding, alcohol, for, example, acetic, acid, and, ethanol, gives, ethyl, acetate, and, water, most, acetate, esters, however, are, produced, from, acetaldehyde, using, the, tishchenko, reaction, in, addition, ether, acetates, are, used, as, solvents, for, nitrocellulose, acrylic, lacquers, varnish, removers, and, wood, stains, first, glycol, monoethers, are, produced, from, ethylene, oxide, or, propylene, oxide, with, alcohol, which, are, then, esterified, with, acetic, acid, the, three, major, products, are, ethylene, glycol, monoethyl, ether, acetate, eea, ethylene, glycol, monobutyl, ether, acetate, eba, and, propylene, glycol, monomethyl, ether, acetate, pma, more, commonly, known, as, pgmea, in, semiconductor, manufacturing, processes, where, it, is, used, as, a, resist, solvent, this, application, consumes, about, 15, to, 20, of, worldwide, acetic, acid, ether, acetates, for, example, eea, have, been, shown, to, be, harmful, to, human, reproduction, the, product, of, the, condensation, of, two, molecules, of, acetic, acid, is, acetic, anhydride, the, worldwide, production, of, acetic, anhydride, is, a, major, application, and, uses, approximately, 25, to, 30, of, the, global, production, of, acetic, acid, the, main, process, involves, dehydration, of, acetic, acid, to, give, ketene, at, 700, 750, c, ketene, is, thereafter, reacted, with, acetic, acid, to, obtain, the, anhydride, acetic, anhydride, is, an, acetylation, agent, as, such, its, major, application, is, for, cellulose, acetate, a, synthetic, textile, also, used, for, photographic, film, acetic, anhydride, is, also, a, reagent, for, the, production, of, heroin, and, other, compounds, as, a, polar, protic, solvent, acetic, acid, is, frequently, used, for, recrystallization, to, purify, organic, compounds, acetic, acid, is, used, as, a, solvent, in, the, production, of, terephthalic, acid, tpa, the, raw, material, for, polyethylene, terephthalate, pet, in, 2006, about, 20, of, acetic, acid, was, used, for, tpa, production, acetic, acid, is, often, used, as, a, solvent, for, reactions, involving, carbocations, such, as, friedel, crafts, alkylation, for, example, one, stage, in, the, commercial, manufacture, of, synthetic, camphor, involves, a, wagner, meerwein, rearrangement, of, camphene, to, isobornyl, acetate, here, acetic, acid, acts, both, as, a, solvent, and, as, a, nucleophile, to, trap, the, rearranged, carbocation, glacial, acetic, acid, is, used, in, analytical, chemistry, for, the, estimation, of, weakly, alkaline, substances, such, as, organic, amides, glacial, acetic, acid, is, a, much, weaker, base, than, water, so, the, amide, behaves, as, a, strong, base, in, this, medium, it, then, can, be, titrated, using, a, solution, in, glacial, acetic, acid, of, a, very, strong, acid, such, as, perchloric, acid, acetic, acid, injection, into, a, tumor, has, been, used, to, treat, cancer, since, the, 1800s, acetic, acid, is, used, as, part, of, cervical, cancer, screening, in, many, areas, in, the, developing, world, the, acid, is, applied, to, the, cervix, and, if, an, area, of, white, appears, after, about, a, minute, the, test, is, positive, acetic, acid, is, an, effective, antiseptic, when, used, as, a, 1, solution, with, broad, spectrum, of, activity, against, streptococci, staphylococci, pseudomonas, enterococci, and, others, it, may, be, used, to, treat, skin, infections, caused, by, pseudomonas, strains, resistant, to, typical, antibiotics, while, diluted, acetic, acid, is, used, in, iontophoresis, no, high, quality, evidence, supports, this, treatment, for, rotator, cuff, disease, as, a, treatment, for, otitis, externa, it, is, on, the, world, health, organization, s, list, of, essential, medicines, acetic, acid, has, 349, kcal, 1, 460, kj, per, 100, g, vinegar, is, typically, no, less, than, 4, acetic, acid, by, mass, legal, limits, on, acetic, acid, content, vary, by, jurisdiction, vinegar, is, used, directly, as, a, condiment, and, in, the, pickling, of, vegetables, and, other, foods, table, vinegar, tends, to, be, more, diluted, 4, to, 8, acetic, acid, while, commercial, food, pickling, employs, solutions, that, are, more, concentrated, the, proportion, of, acetic, acid, used, worldwide, as, vinegar, is, not, as, large, as, industrial, uses, but, it, is, by, far, the, oldest, and, best, known, application, acetyl, chloride, acetic, acid, ethanol, acetic, acid, undergoes, the, typical, chemical, reactions, of, a, carboxylic, acid, upon, treatment, with, a, standard, base, it, converts, to, metal, acetate, and, water, with, strong, bases, e, g, organolithium, reagents, it, can, be, doubly, deprotonated, to, give, lich, 2, cooli, reduction, of, acetic, acid, gives, ethanol, the, oh, group, is, the, main, site, of, reaction, as, illustrated, by, the, conversion, of, acetic, acid, to, acetyl, chloride, other, substitution, derivatives, include, acetic, anhydride, this, anhydride, is, produced, by, loss, of, water, from, two, molecules, of, acetic, acid, esters, of, acetic, acid, can, likewise, be, formed, via, fischer, esterification, and, amides, can, be, formed, when, heated, above, 440, c, 824, f, acetic, acid, decomposes, to, produce, carbon, dioxide, and, methane, or, to, produce, ketene, and, water, acetic, acid, is, mildly, corrosive, to, metals, including, iron, magnesium, and, zinc, forming, hydrogen, gas, and, salts, called, acetates, because, aluminium, forms, a, passivating, acid, resistant, film, of, aluminium, oxide, aluminium, tanks, are, used, to, transport, acetic, acid, containers, lined, with, glass, stainless, steel, or, polyethylene, are, also, used, for, this, purpose, metal, acetates, can, also, be, prepared, from, acetic, acid, and, an, appropriate, base, as, in, the, popular, baking, soda, vinegar, reaction, giving, off, sodium, acetate, a, colour, reaction, for, salts, of, acetic, acid, is, iron, iii, chloride, solution, which, results, in, a, deeply, red, colour, that, disappears, after, acidification, a, more, sensitive, test, uses, lanthanum, nitrate, with, iodine, and, ammonia, to, give, a, blue, solution, acetates, when, heated, with, arsenic, trioxide, form, cacodyl, oxide, which, can, be, detected, by, its, malodorous, vapours, organic, or, inorganic, salts, are, produced, from, acetic, acid, some, commercially, significant, derivatives, halogenated, acetic, acids, are, produced, from, acetic, acid, some, commercially, significant, derivatives, amounts, of, acetic, acid, used, in, these, other, applications, together, account, for, another, 5, 10, of, acetic, acid, use, worldwide, prolonged, inhalation, exposure, eight, hours, to, acetic, acid, vapours, at, 10, ppm, can, produce, some, irritation, of, eyes, nose, and, throat, at, 100, ppm, marked, lung, irritation, and, possible, damage, to, lungs, eyes, and, skin, may, result, vapour, concentrations, of, 1, 000, ppm, cause, marked, irritation, of, eyes, nose, and, upper, respiratory, tract, and, cannot, be, tolerated, these, predictions, were, based, on, animal, experiments, and, industrial, exposure, in, 12, workers, exposed, for, two, or, more, years, to, an, airborne, average, concentration, of, 51, ppm, acetic, acid, estimated, symptoms, of, conjunctive, irritation, upper, respiratory, tract, irritation, and, hyperkeratotic, dermatitis, were, produced, exposure, to, 50, ppm, or, more, is, intolerable, to, most, persons, and, results, in, intensive, lacrimation, and, irritation, of, the, eyes, nose, and, throat, with, pharyngeal, oedema, and, chronic, bronchitis, unacclimatised, humans, experience, extreme, eye, and, nasal, irritation, at, concentrations, in, excess, of, 25, ppm, and, conjunctivitis, from, concentrations, below, 10, ppm, has, been, reported, in, a, study, of, five, workers, exposed, for, seven, to, 12, years, to, concentrations, of, 80, to, 200, ppm, at, peaks, the, principal, findings, were, blackening, and, hyperkeratosis, of, the, skin, of, the, hands, conjunctivitis, but, no, corneal, damage, bronchitis, and, pharyngitis, and, erosion, of, the, exposed, teeth, incisors, and, canines, concentrated, acetic, acid, 25, is, corrosive, to, skin, these, burns, or, blisters, may, not, appear, until, hours, after, exposure, the, hazardous, properties, of, acetic, acid, are, dependent, on, the, concentration, of, the, typically, aqueous, solution, with, the, most, significant, increases, in, hazard, levels, at, thresholds, of, 25, and, 90, acetic, acid, concentration, by, weight, the, following, table, summarizes, the, hazards, of, acetic, acid, solutions, by, concentration, concentrated, acetic, acid, can, be, ignited, only, with, difficulty, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, but, becomes, a, flammable, risk, in, temperatures, greater, than, 39, c, 102, f, and, can, form, explosive, mixtures, with, air, at, higher, temperatures, with, explosive, limits, of, 5, 4, 16, concentration
