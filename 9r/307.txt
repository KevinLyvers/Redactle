redox, r, d, k, s, red, oks, r, i, d, k, s, ree, doks, reduction, oxidation, or, oxidation, reduction, 150, is, a, type, of, chemical, reaction, in, which, the, oxidation, states, of, the, reactants, change, oxidation, is, the, loss, of, electrons, or, an, increase, in, the, oxidation, state, while, reduction, is, the, gain, of, electrons, or, a, decrease, in, the, oxidation, state, the, oxidation, and, reduction, processes, occur, simultaneously, in, the, chemical, reaction, there, are, two, classes, of, redox, reactions, redox, is, a, portmanteau, of, the, words, reduction, and, oxidation, the, term, redox, was, first, used, in, 1928, oxidation, is, a, process, in, which, a, substance, loses, electrons, reduction, is, a, process, in, which, a, substance, gains, electrons, the, processes, of, oxidation, and, reduction, occur, simultaneously, and, cannot, occur, independently, in, redox, processes, the, reductant, transfers, electrons, to, the, oxidant, thus, in, the, reaction, the, reductant, or, reducing, agent, loses, electrons, and, is, oxidized, and, the, oxidant, or, oxidizing, agent, gains, electrons, and, is, reduced, the, pair, of, an, oxidizing, and, reducing, agent, that, is, involved, in, a, particular, reaction, is, called, a, redox, pair, a, redox, couple, is, a, reducing, species, and, its, corresponding, oxidizing, form, e, g, fe, 2, fe, 3, the, oxidation, alone, and, the, reduction, alone, are, each, called, a, half, reaction, because, two, half, reactions, always, occur, together, to, form, a, whole, reaction, oxidation, originally, implied, a, reaction, with, oxygen, to, form, an, oxide, later, the, term, was, expanded, to, encompass, substances, that, accomplished, chemical, reactions, similar, to, those, of, oxygen, ultimately, the, meaning, was, generalized, to, include, all, processes, involving, the, loss, of, electrons, or, the, increase, in, the, oxidation, state, of, a, chemical, species, a49, substances, that, have, the, ability, to, oxidize, other, substances, cause, them, to, lose, electrons, are, said, to, be, oxidative, or, oxidizing, and, are, known, as, oxidizing, agents, oxidants, or, oxidizers, the, oxidant, removes, electrons, from, another, substance, and, is, thus, itself, reduced, a50, because, it, accepts, electrons, the, oxidizing, agent, is, also, called, an, electron, acceptor, oxidants, are, usually, chemical, substances, with, elements, in, high, oxidation, states, 159, e, g, n, 2, o, 4, mno, 4, cro, 3, cr, 2, o, 2, 7, oso, 4, or, else, highly, electronegative, elements, e, g, o, 2, f, 2, cl, 2, br, 2, i, 2, that, can, gain, extra, electrons, by, oxidizing, another, substance, 909, oxidizers, are, oxidants, but, the, term, is, mainly, reserved, for, sources, of, oxygen, particularly, in, the, context, of, explosions, nitric, acid, is, a, strong, oxidizer, substances, that, have, the, ability, to, reduce, other, substances, cause, them, to, gain, electrons, are, said, to, be, reductive, or, reducing, and, are, known, as, reducing, agents, reductants, or, reducers, the, reductant, transfers, electrons, to, another, substance, and, is, thus, itself, oxidized, 159, because, it, donates, electrons, the, reducing, agent, is, also, called, an, electron, donor, electron, donors, can, also, form, charge, transfer, complexes, with, electron, acceptors, the, word, reduction, originally, referred, to, the, loss, in, weight, upon, heating, a, metallic, ore, such, as, a, metal, oxide, to, extract, the, metal, in, other, words, ore, was, reduced, to, metal, antoine, lavoisier, demonstrated, that, this, loss, of, weight, was, due, to, the, loss, of, oxygen, as, a, gas, later, scientists, realized, that, the, metal, atom, gains, electrons, in, this, process, the, meaning, of, reduction, then, became, generalized, to, include, all, processes, involving, a, gain, of, electrons, reducing, equivalent, refers, to, chemical, species, which, transfer, the, equivalent, of, one, electron, in, redox, reactions, the, term, is, common, in, biochemistry, a, reducing, equivalent, can, be, an, electron, or, a, hydrogen, atom, as, a, hydride, ion, reductants, in, chemistry, are, very, diverse, electropositive, elemental, metals, such, as, lithium, sodium, magnesium, iron, zinc, and, aluminium, are, good, reducing, agents, these, metals, donate, electrons, relatively, readily, hydride, transfer, reagents, such, as, nabh, 4, and, lialh, 4, reduce, by, atom, transfer, they, transfer, the, equivalent, of, hydride, or, h, these, reagents, are, widely, used, in, the, reduction, of, carbonyl, compounds, to, alcohols, a, related, method, of, reduction, involves, the, use, of, hydrogen, gas, h, 2, as, sources, of, h, atoms, 288, the, electrochemist, john, bockris, proposed, the, words, electronation, and, deelectronation, to, describe, reduction, and, oxidation, processes, respectively, when, they, occur, at, electrodes, these, words, are, analogous, to, protonation, and, deprotonation, they, have, not, been, widely, adopted, by, chemists, worldwide, although, iupac, has, recognized, the, terms, electronation, and, de, electronation, redox, reactions, can, occur, slowly, as, in, the, formation, of, rust, or, rapidly, as, in, the, case, of, burning, fuel, electron, transfer, reactions, are, generally, fast, occurring, within, the, time, of, mixing, the, mechanisms, of, atom, transfer, reactions, are, highly, variable, because, many, kinds, of, atoms, can, be, transferred, such, reactions, can, also, be, quite, complex, involving, many, steps, the, mechanisms, of, electron, transfer, reactions, occur, by, two, distinct, pathways, inner, sphere, electron, transfer, and, outer, sphere, electron, transfer, analysis, of, bond, energies, and, ionization, energies, in, water, allows, calculation, of, the, thermodynamic, aspects, of, redox, reactions, each, half, reaction, has, a, standard, electrode, potential, e, o, cell, which, is, equal, to, the, potential, difference, or, voltage, at, equilibrium, under, standard, conditions, of, an, electrochemical, cell, in, which, the, cathode, reaction, is, the, half, reaction, considered, and, the, anode, is, a, standard, hydrogen, electrode, where, hydrogen, is, oxidized, the, electrode, potential, of, each, half, reaction, is, also, known, as, its, reduction, potential, e, o, red, or, potential, when, the, half, reaction, takes, place, at, a, cathode, the, reduction, potential, is, a, measure, of, the, tendency, of, the, oxidizing, agent, to, be, reduced, its, value, is, zero, for, h, e, 1, 2, h, 2, by, definition, positive, for, oxidizing, agents, stronger, than, h, e, g, 2, 866, v, for, f, 2, and, negative, for, oxidizing, agents, that, are, weaker, than, h, e, g, 0, 763v, for, zn, 2, 873, for, a, redox, reaction, that, takes, place, in, a, cell, the, potential, difference, is, however, the, potential, of, the, reaction, at, the, anode, is, sometimes, expressed, as, an, oxidation, potential, the, oxidation, potential, is, a, measure, of, the, tendency, of, the, reducing, agent, to, be, oxidized, but, does, not, represent, the, physical, potential, at, an, electrode, with, this, notation, the, cell, voltage, equation, is, written, with, a, plus, sign, in, the, reaction, between, hydrogen, and, fluorine, hydrogen, is, being, oxidized, and, fluorine, is, being, reduced, this, spontaneous, reaction, releases, 542, kj, per, 2, g, of, hydrogen, because, the, h, f, bond, is, much, stronger, than, the, f, f, bond, this, reaction, can, be, analyzed, as, two, half, reactions, the, oxidation, reaction, converts, hydrogen, to, protons, the, reduction, reaction, converts, fluorine, to, the, fluoride, anion, the, half, reactions, are, combined, so, that, the, electrons, cancel, the, protons, and, fluoride, combine, to, form, hydrogen, fluoride, in, a, non, redox, reaction, the, overall, reaction, is, in, this, type, of, reaction, a, metal, atom, in, a, compound, or, solution, is, replaced, by, an, atom, of, another, metal, for, example, copper, is, deposited, when, zinc, metal, is, placed, in, a, copper, ii, sulfate, solution, in, the, above, reaction, zinc, metal, displaces, the, copper, ii, ion, from, the, copper, sulfate, solution, thus, liberating, free, copper, metal, the, reaction, is, spontaneous, and, releases, 213, kj, per, 65, g, of, zinc, the, ionic, equation, for, this, reaction, is, as, two, half, reactions, it, is, seen, that, the, zinc, is, oxidized, and, the, copper, is, reduced, a, disproportionation, reaction, is, one, in, which, a, single, substance, is, both, oxidized, and, reduced, for, example, thiosulfate, ion, with, sulfur, in, oxidation, state, 2, can, react, in, the, presence, of, acid, to, form, elemental, sulfur, oxidation, state, 0, and, sulfur, dioxide, oxidation, state, 4, thus, one, sulfur, atom, is, reduced, from, 2, to, 0, while, the, other, is, oxidized, from, 2, to, 4, 176, cathodic, protection, is, a, technique, used, to, control, the, corrosion, of, a, metal, surface, by, making, it, the, cathode, of, an, electrochemical, cell, a, simple, method, of, protection, connects, protected, metal, to, a, more, easily, corroded, sacrificial, anode, to, act, as, the, anode, the, sacrificial, metal, instead, of, the, protected, metal, then, corrodes, a, common, application, of, cathodic, protection, is, in, galvanized, steel, in, which, a, sacrificial, zinc, coating, on, steel, parts, protects, them, from, rust, oxidation, is, used, in, a, wide, variety, of, industries, such, as, in, the, production, of, cleaning, products, and, oxidizing, ammonia, to, produce, nitric, acid, redox, reactions, are, the, foundation, of, electrochemical, cells, which, can, generate, electrical, energy, or, support, electrosynthesis, metal, ores, often, contain, metals, in, oxidized, states, such, as, oxides, or, sulfides, from, which, the, pure, metals, are, extracted, by, smelting, at, high, temperatures, in, the, presence, of, a, reducing, agent, the, process, of, electroplating, uses, redox, reactions, to, coat, objects, with, a, thin, layer, of, a, material, as, in, chrome, plated, automotive, parts, silver, plating, cutlery, galvanization, and, gold, plated, jewelry, many, essential, biological, processes, involve, redox, reactions, before, some, of, these, processes, can, begin, iron, must, be, assimilated, from, the, environment, cellular, respiration, for, instance, is, the, oxidation, of, glucose, c, 6, h, 12, o, 6, to, co, 2, and, the, reduction, of, oxygen, to, water, the, summary, equation, for, cell, respiration, is, the, process, of, cell, respiration, also, depends, heavily, on, the, reduction, of, nad, to, nadh, and, the, reverse, reaction, the, oxidation, of, nadh, to, nad, photosynthesis, and, cellular, respiration, are, complementary, but, photosynthesis, is, not, the, reverse, of, the, redox, reaction, in, cell, respiration, biological, energy, is, frequently, stored, and, released, using, redox, reactions, photosynthesis, involves, the, reduction, of, carbon, dioxide, into, sugars, and, the, oxidation, of, water, into, molecular, oxygen, the, reverse, reaction, respiration, oxidizes, sugars, to, produce, carbon, dioxide, and, water, as, intermediate, steps, the, reduced, carbon, compounds, are, used, to, reduce, nicotinamide, adenine, dinucleotide, nad, to, nadh, which, then, contributes, to, the, creation, of, a, proton, gradient, which, drives, the, synthesis, of, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, and, is, maintained, by, the, reduction, of, oxygen, in, animal, cells, mitochondria, perform, similar, functions, free, radical, reactions, are, redox, reactions, that, occur, as, part, of, homeostasis, and, killing, microorganisms, in, these, reactions, an, electron, detaches, from, a, molecule, and, then, re, attaches, almost, instantaneously, free, radicals, are, part, of, redox, molecules, and, can, become, harmful, to, the, human, body, if, they, do, not, reattach, to, the, redox, molecule, or, an, antioxidant, the, term, redox, state, is, often, used, to, describe, the, balance, of, gsh, gssg, nad, nadh, and, nadp, nadph, in, a, biological, system, such, as, a, cell, or, organ, the, redox, state, is, reflected, in, the, balance, of, several, sets, of, metabolites, e, g, lactate, and, pyruvate, beta, hydroxybutyrate, and, acetoacetate, whose, interconversion, is, dependent, on, these, ratios, redox, mechanisms, also, control, some, cellular, processes, redox, proteins, and, their, genes, must, be, co, located, for, redox, regulation, according, to, the, corr, hypothesis, for, the, function, of, dna, in, mitochondria, and, chloroplasts, wide, varieties, of, aromatic, compounds, are, enzymatically, reduced, to, form, free, radicals, that, contain, one, more, electron, than, their, parent, compounds, in, general, the, electron, donor, is, any, of, a, wide, variety, of, flavoenzymes, and, their, coenzymes, once, formed, these, anion, free, radicals, reduce, molecular, oxygen, to, superoxide, and, regenerate, the, unchanged, parent, compound, the, net, reaction, is, the, oxidation, of, the, flavoenzyme, s, coenzymes, and, the, reduction, of, molecular, oxygen, to, form, superoxide, this, catalytic, behavior, has, been, described, as, a, futile, cycle, or, redox, cycling, minerals, are, generally, oxidized, derivatives, of, metals, iron, is, mined, as, its, magnetite, fe, 3, o, 4, titanium, is, mined, as, its, dioxide, usually, in, the, form, of, rutile, tio, 2, these, oxides, must, be, reduced, to, obtain, the, corresponding, metals, often, achieved, by, heating, these, oxides, with, carbon, or, carbon, monoxide, as, reducing, agents, blast, furnaces, are, the, reactors, where, iron, oxides, and, coke, a, form, of, carbon, are, combined, to, produce, molten, iron, the, main, chemical, reaction, producing, the, molten, iron, is, electron, transfer, reactions, are, central, to, myriad, processes, and, properties, in, soils, and, redox, potential, quantified, as, eh, platinum, electrode, potential, voltage, relative, to, the, standard, hydrogen, electrode, or, pe, analogous, to, ph, as, log, electron, activity, is, a, master, variable, along, with, ph, that, controls, and, is, governed, by, chemical, reactions, and, biological, processes, early, theoretical, research, with, applications, to, flooded, soils, and, paddy, rice, production, was, seminal, for, subsequent, work, on, thermodynamic, aspects, of, redox, and, plant, root, growth, in, soils, later, work, built, on, this, foundation, and, expanded, it, for, understanding, redox, reactions, related, to, heavy, metal, oxidation, state, changes, pedogenesis, and, morphology, organic, compound, degradation, and, formation, free, radical, chemistry, wetland, delineation, soil, remediation, and, various, methodological, approaches, for, characterizing, the, redox, status, of, soils, the, key, terms, involved, in, redox, can, be, confusing, for, example, a, reagent, that, is, oxidized, loses, electrons, however, that, reagent, is, referred, to, as, the, reducing, agent, likewise, a, reagent, that, is, reduced, gains, electrons, and, is, referred, to, as, the, oxidizing, agent, these, mnemonics, are, commonly, used, by, students, to, help, memorise, the, terminology
