a, season, is, a, division, of, the, year, based, on, changes, in, weather, ecology, and, the, number, of, daylight, hours, in, a, given, region, on, earth, seasons, are, the, result, of, the, axial, parallelism, of, earth, s, tilted, orbit, around, the, sun, in, temperate, and, polar, regions, the, seasons, are, marked, by, changes, in, the, intensity, of, sunlight, that, reaches, the, earth, s, surface, variations, of, which, may, cause, animals, to, undergo, hibernation, or, to, migrate, and, plants, to, be, dormant, various, cultures, define, the, number, and, nature, of, seasons, based, on, regional, variations, and, as, such, there, are, a, number, of, both, modern, and, historical, definitions, of, the, seasons, the, northern, hemisphere, experiences, most, direct, sunlight, during, may, june, and, july, thus, the, traditional, celebration, of, midsummer, in, june, as, the, hemisphere, faces, the, sun, for, the, southern, hemisphere, it, is, instead, in, november, december, and, january, it, is, earth, s, axial, tilt, that, causes, the, sun, to, be, higher, in, the, sky, during, the, summer, months, which, increases, the, solar, flux, due, to, seasonal, lag, june, july, and, august, are, the, warmest, months, in, the, northern, hemisphere, while, december, january, and, february, are, the, warmest, months, in, the, southern, hemisphere, in, temperate, and, sub, polar, regions, four, seasons, based, on, the, gregorian, calendar, are, generally, recognized, spring, summer, autumn, fall, and, winter, ecologists, often, use, a, six, season, model, for, temperate, climate, regions, which, are, not, tied, to, any, fixed, calendar, dates, prevernal, vernal, estival, serotinal, autumnal, and, hibernal, many, tropical, regions, have, two, seasons, the, rainy, wet, monsoon, season, and, the, dry, season, some, have, a, third, cool, mild, or, harmattan, season, seasons, can, also, be, dictated, by, the, timing, of, important, ecological, events, such, as, hurricane, season, tornado, season, and, wildfire, season, some, examples, of, historical, importance, are, the, ancient, egyptian, seasons, flood, growth, and, low, water, which, were, previously, defined, by, the, former, annual, flooding, of, the, nile, in, egypt, seasons, often, hold, special, significance, for, agrarian, societies, whose, lives, revolve, around, planting, and, harvest, times, and, the, change, of, seasons, is, often, attended, by, ritual, the, definition, of, seasons, is, also, cultural, in, india, from, ancient, times, to, the, present, day, six, seasons, or, ritu, based, on, south, asian, religious, or, cultural, calendars, are, recognised, and, identified, for, purposes, such, as, agriculture, and, trade, the, earth, s, orbit, exhibits, approximate, axial, parallelism, maintaining, its, direction, toward, polaris, the, north, star, year, round, this, is, one, of, the, primary, reasons, for, the, earth, s, seasons, as, illustrated, by, the, diagram, to, the, right, minor, variation, in, the, direction, of, the, axis, known, as, axial, precession, takes, place, over, the, course, of, 26, 000, years, and, therefore, is, not, noticeable, to, modern, human, civilization, the, seasons, result, from, the, earth, s, axis, of, rotation, being, tilted, with, respect, to, its, orbital, plane, by, an, angle, of, approximately, 23, 4, degrees, this, tilt, is, also, known, as, obliquity, of, the, ecliptic, regardless, of, the, time, of, year, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, always, experience, opposite, seasons, this, is, because, during, summer, or, winter, one, part, of, the, planet, is, more, directly, exposed, to, the, rays, of, the, sun, than, the, other, and, this, exposure, alternates, as, the, earth, revolves, in, its, orbit, for, approximately, half, of, the, year, from, around, march, 20, to, around, september, 22, the, northern, hemisphere, tips, toward, the, sun, with, the, maximum, amount, occurring, on, about, june, 21, for, the, other, half, of, the, year, the, same, happens, but, in, the, southern, hemisphere, instead, of, the, northern, with, the, maximum, around, december, 21, the, two, instants, when, the, sun, is, directly, overhead, at, the, equator, are, the, equinoxes, also, at, that, moment, both, the, north, pole, and, the, south, pole, of, the, earth, are, just, on, the, terminator, and, hence, day, and, night, are, equally, divided, between, the, two, hemispheres, around, the, march, equinox, the, northern, hemisphere, will, be, experiencing, spring, as, the, hours, of, daylight, increase, and, the, southern, hemisphere, is, experiencing, autumn, as, daylight, hours, shorten, the, effect, of, axial, tilt, is, observable, as, the, change, in, day, length, and, the, altitude, of, the, sun, at, solar, noon, the, sun, s, culmination, during, the, year, the, low, angle, of, the, sun, during, the, winter, months, means, that, incoming, rays, of, solar, radiation, are, spread, over, a, larger, area, of, the, earth, s, surface, so, the, light, received, is, more, indirect, and, of, lower, intensity, between, this, effect, and, the, shorter, daylight, hours, the, axial, tilt, of, the, earth, accounts, for, most, of, the, seasonal, variation, in, climate, in, both, hemispheres, compared, to, axial, parallelism, and, axial, tilt, other, factors, contribute, little, to, seasonal, temperature, changes, the, seasons, are, not, the, result, of, the, variation, in, earth, s, distance, to, the, sun, because, of, its, elliptical, orbit, in, fact, earth, reaches, perihelion, the, point, in, its, orbit, closest, to, the, sun, in, january, and, it, reaches, aphelion, the, point, farthest, from, the, sun, in, july, so, the, slight, contribution, of, orbital, eccentricity, opposes, the, temperature, trends, of, the, seasons, in, the, northern, hemisphere, in, general, the, effect, of, orbital, eccentricity, on, earth, s, seasons, is, a, 7, variation, in, sunlight, received, orbital, eccentricity, can, influence, temperatures, but, on, earth, this, effect, is, small, and, is, more, than, counteracted, by, other, factors, research, shows, that, the, earth, as, a, whole, is, actually, slightly, warmer, when, farther, from, the, sun, this, is, because, the, northern, hemisphere, has, more, land, than, the, southern, and, land, warms, more, readily, than, sea, any, noticeable, intensification, of, southern, winters, and, summers, due, to, earth, s, elliptical, orbit, is, mitigated, by, the, abundance, of, water, in, the, southern, hemisphere, seasonal, weather, fluctuations, changes, also, depend, on, factors, such, as, proximity, to, oceans, or, other, large, bodies, of, water, currents, in, those, oceans, el, ni, o, enso, and, other, oceanic, cycles, and, prevailing, winds, in, the, temperate, and, polar, regions, seasons, are, marked, by, changes, in, the, amount, of, sunlight, which, in, turn, often, causes, cycles, of, dormancy, in, plants, and, hibernation, in, animals, these, effects, vary, with, latitude, and, with, proximity, to, bodies, of, water, for, example, the, south, pole, is, in, the, middle, of, the, continent, of, antarctica, and, therefore, a, considerable, distance, from, the, moderating, influence, of, the, southern, oceans, the, north, pole, is, in, the, arctic, ocean, and, thus, its, temperature, extremes, are, buffered, by, the, water, the, result, is, that, the, south, pole, is, consistently, colder, during, the, southern, winter, than, the, north, pole, during, the, northern, winter, the, seasonal, cycle, in, the, polar, and, temperate, zones, of, one, hemisphere, is, opposite, to, that, of, the, other, when, it, is, summer, in, the, northern, hemisphere, it, is, winter, in, the, southern, and, vice, versa, the, tropical, and, to, a, lesser, degree, subtropical, regions, see, little, annual, fluctuation, of, sunlight, and, temperature, due, earth, s, moderate, 23, 4, degree, tilt, being, insufficient, to, appreciably, affect, the, strength, of, the, sun, s, rays, annually, the, slight, differences, between, the, solstices, and, the, equinoxes, cause, seasonal, shifts, along, a, rainy, low, pressure, belt, called, the, intertropical, convergence, zone, icz, as, a, result, the, amount, of, precipitation, tends, to, vary, more, dramatically, than, the, average, temperature, when, the, icz, is, north, of, the, equator, the, northern, tropics, experience, their, wet, season, while, the, southern, tropics, have, their, dry, season, this, pattern, reverses, when, the, icz, migrates, to, a, position, south, of, the, equator, in, meteorological, terms, the, solstices, the, maximum, and, minimum, insolation, do, not, fall, in, the, middles, of, summer, and, winter, the, heights, of, these, seasons, occur, up, to, 7, weeks, later, because, of, seasonal, lag, seasons, though, are, not, always, defined, in, meteorological, terms, in, astronomical, reckoning, by, hours, of, daylight, alone, the, solstices, and, equinoxes, are, in, the, middle, of, the, respective, seasons, because, of, seasonal, lag, due, to, thermal, absorption, and, release, by, the, oceans, regions, with, a, continental, climate, which, predominate, in, the, northern, hemisphere, often, consider, these, four, dates, to, be, the, start, of, the, seasons, as, in, the, diagram, with, the, cross, quarter, days, considered, seasonal, midpoints, the, length, of, these, seasons, is, not, uniform, because, of, earth, s, elliptical, orbit, and, its, different, speeds, along, that, orbit, most, calendar, based, partitions, use, a, four, season, model, to, demarcate, the, warmest, and, coldest, seasons, which, are, further, separated, by, two, intermediate, seasons, calendar, based, reckoning, defines, the, seasons, in, relative, rather, than, absolute, terms, so, the, coldest, quarter, year, is, considered, winter, even, if, floral, activity, is, regularly, observed, during, it, despite, the, traditional, association, of, flowers, with, spring, and, summer, the, major, exception, is, in, the, tropics, where, as, already, noted, the, winter, season, is, not, observed, the, four, seasons, have, been, in, use, since, at, least, roman, times, as, in, rerum, rusticarum, of, varro, varro, says, that, spring, summer, autumn, and, winter, start, on, the, 23rd, day, of, the, sun, s, passage, through, aquarius, taurus, leo, and, scorpio, respectively, nine, years, before, he, wrote, julius, caesar, had, reformed, the, calendar, so, varro, was, able, to, assign, the, dates, of, february, 7, may, 9, august, 11, and, november, 10, to, the, start, of, spring, summer, autumn, and, winter, as, noted, a, variety, of, dates, and, even, exact, times, are, used, in, different, countries, or, regions, to, mark, changes, of, the, calendar, seasons, these, observances, are, often, declared, official, within, their, respective, areas, by, the, local, or, national, media, even, when, the, weather, or, climate, is, contradictory, these, are, mainly, a, matter, of, custom, and, not, generally, proclaimed, by, governments, north, or, south, of, the, equator, for, civil, purposes, meteorological, seasons, are, reckoned, by, temperature, with, summer, being, the, hottest, quarter, of, the, year, and, winter, the, coldest, quarter, of, the, year, in, 1780, the, societas, meteorologica, palatina, which, became, defunct, in, 1795, an, early, international, organization, for, meteorology, defined, seasons, as, groupings, of, three, whole, months, as, identified, by, the, gregorian, calendar, according, to, this, definition, for, temperate, areas, in, the, northern, hemisphere, spring, begins, on, 1, march, summer, on, 1, june, autumn, on, 1, september, and, winter, on, 1, december, for, the, southern, hemisphere, temperate, zone, spring, begins, on, 1, september, summer, on, 1, december, autumn, on, 1, march, and, winter, on, 1, june, in, australasia, the, meteorological, terms, for, seasons, apply, to, the, temperate, zone, that, occupies, all, of, new, zealand, new, south, wales, victoria, tasmania, the, south, eastern, corner, of, south, australia, and, the, south, west, of, western, australia, and, the, south, east, queensland, areas, south, of, brisbane, in, sweden, and, finland, meteorologists, and, news, outlets, use, the, concept, of, thermal, seasons, which, are, defined, based, on, mean, daily, temperatures, the, beginning, of, spring, is, defined, as, when, the, mean, daily, temperature, permanently, rises, above, 0, c, the, beginning, of, summer, is, defined, as, when, the, temperature, permanently, rises, above, 10, c, autumn, as, when, the, temperature, permanently, falls, below, 10, c, and, winter, as, when, the, temperature, permanently, falls, below, 0, c, in, finland, permanently, is, defined, as, when, the, mean, daily, averaged, temperature, remains, above, or, below, the, defined, limit, for, seven, consecutive, days, in, sweden, the, number, of, days, ranges, from, 5, to, 7, depending, on, the, season, this, implies, two, things, the, india, meteorological, department, imd, designates, four, climatological, seasons, in, china, a, common, temperature, based, reckoning, holds, that, it, is, winter, for, the, period, when, temperatures, are, below, 10, c, on, average, and, summer, for, the, period, when, temperatures, are, above, 22, c, on, average, this, means, that, areas, with, relatively, extreme, climates, such, as, the, paracel, islands, and, parts, of, the, tibetan, plateau, may, be, said, to, have, summer, all, year, round, or, winter, all, year, round, astronomical, timing, as, the, basis, for, designating, the, temperate, seasons, dates, back, at, least, to, the, julian, calendar, used, by, the, ancient, romans, as, mentioned, above, varro, wrote, that, spring, summer, autumn, and, winter, start, on, the, 23rd, day, of, the, sun, s, passage, through, aquarius, taurus, leo, and, scorpio, respectively, and, that, in, the, julian, calendar, these, days, were, february, 7, may, 9, august, 11, and, november, 10, he, points, out, that, the, lengths, are, not, equal, being, 91, in, non, leap, years, 94, 91, and, 89, days, for, spring, summer, autumn, and, winter, respectively, the, midpoints, of, these, seasons, were, march, 24, or, 25, june, 25, september, 25, or, 26, and, december, 24, or, 25, which, are, near, to, the, equinoxes, and, solstices, of, his, day, pliny, the, elder, in, his, natural, history, mentions, the, two, equinoxes, and, the, two, solstices, and, gives, the, lengths, of, the, intervals, values, which, were, fairly, correct, in, his, day, but, are, no, longer, very, correct, because, the, perihelion, has, moved, from, december, into, january, he, then, defines, the, seasons, of, autumn, winter, spring, and, summer, as, starting, half, way, through, these, intervals, he, gives, the, eighth, day, to, the, kalends, of, january, december, 25, as, the, date, of, the, winter, solstice, though, actually, it, occurred, on, the, 22nd, or, 23rd, at, that, time, nowadays, the, astronomical, timing, has, winter, starting, at, the, winter, solstice, spring, at, the, spring, equinox, and, so, on, this, is, used, worldwide, although, some, countries, like, australia, new, zealand, pakistan, and, russia, prefer, to, use, meteorological, reckoning, the, precise, timing, of, the, seasons, is, determined, by, the, exact, times, of, the, sun, reaching, the, tropics, of, cancer, and, capricorn, for, the, solstices, and, the, times, of, the, sun, s, transit, over, the, equator, for, the, equinoxes, or, a, traditional, date, close, to, these, times, the, following, diagram, shows, the, relation, between, the, line, of, solstice, and, the, line, of, apsides, of, earth, s, elliptical, orbit, the, orbital, ellipse, with, eccentricity, exaggerated, for, effect, goes, through, each, of, the, six, earth, images, which, are, sequentially, the, perihelion, periapsis, nearest, point, to, the, sun, on, anywhere, from, 2, january, to, 5, january, the, point, of, march, equinox, on, 19, 20, or, 21, march, the, point, of, june, solstice, on, 20, or, 21, june, the, aphelion, apoapsis, farthest, point, from, the, sun, on, anywhere, from, 3, july, to, 6, july, the, september, equinox, on, 22, or, 23, september, and, the, december, solstice, on, 21, or, 22, december, these, astronomical, seasons, are, not, of, equal, length, because, of, the, elliptical, nature, of, the, orbit, of, the, earth, as, discovered, by, johannes, kepler, from, the, march, equinox, it, currently, takes, 92, 75, days, until, the, june, solstice, then, 93, 65, days, until, the, september, equinox, 89, 85, days, until, the, december, solstice, and, finally, 88, 99, days, until, the, march, equinox, thus, the, time, from, the, march, equinox, to, the, september, equinox, is, 7, 56, days, longer, than, from, the, september, equinox, to, the, march, equinox, the, times, of, the, equinoxes, and, solstices, are, not, fixed, with, respect, to, the, modern, gregorian, calendar, but, fall, about, six, hours, later, every, year, amounting, to, one, full, day, in, four, years, they, are, reset, by, the, occurrence, of, a, leap, year, the, gregorian, calendar, is, designed, to, keep, the, march, equinox, no, later, than, 21, march, as, accurately, as, is, practical, the, calendar, equinox, used, in, the, calculation, of, easter, is, 21, march, the, same, date, as, in, the, easter, tables, current, at, the, time, of, the, council, of, nicaea, in, ad, 325, the, calendar, is, therefore, framed, to, prevent, the, astronomical, equinox, wandering, onto, 22, march, from, nicaea, to, the, date, of, the, reform, the, years, 500, 600, 700, 900, 1000, 1100, 1300, 1400, and, 1500, which, would, not, have, been, leap, years, in, the, gregorian, calendar, amount, to, nine, extra, days, but, astronomers, directed, that, ten, days, be, removed, because, of, this, the, proleptic, gregorian, calendar, agrees, with, the, julian, calendar, in, the, third, century, of, the, christian, era, rather, than, in, the, fourth, currently, the, most, common, equinox, and, solstice, dates, are, march, 20, june, 21, september, 22, or, 23, and, december, 21, the, four, year, average, slowly, shifts, to, earlier, times, as, a, century, progresses, this, shift, is, a, full, day, in, about, 128, years, compensated, mainly, by, the, century, leap, year, rules, of, the, gregorian, calendar, as, 2000, was, a, leap, year, the, current, shift, has, been, progressing, since, the, beginning, of, the, last, century, when, equinoxes, and, solstices, were, relatively, late, this, also, means, that, in, many, years, of, the, twentieth, century, the, dates, march, 21, june, 22, september, 23, and, december, 22, were, much, more, common, so, older, books, teach, and, older, people, may, still, remember, these, dates, all, the, times, are, given, in, utc, roughly, speaking, the, time, at, greenwich, ignoring, british, summer, time, people, living, farther, to, the, east, asia, and, australia, whose, local, times, are, in, advance, see, the, astronomical, seasons, apparently, start, later, for, example, in, tonga, utc, 13, an, equinox, occurred, on, september, 24, 1999, a, date, on, which, the, equinox, will, not, fall, again, until, 2103, on, the, other, hand, people, living, far, to, the, west, america, whose, clocks, run, behind, utc, may, experience, an, equinox, as, early, as, march, 19, over, thousands, of, years, the, earth, s, axial, tilt, and, orbital, eccentricity, vary, see, milankovitch, cycles, the, equinoxes, and, solstices, move, westward, relative, to, the, stars, while, the, perihelion, and, aphelion, move, eastward, thus, ten, thousand, years, from, now, earth, s, northern, winter, will, occur, at, aphelion, and, northern, summer, at, perihelion, the, severity, of, seasonal, change, the, average, temperature, difference, between, summer, and, winter, in, location, will, also, change, over, time, because, the, earth, s, axial, tilt, fluctuates, between, 22, 1, and, 24, 5, degrees, smaller, irregularities, in, the, times, are, caused, by, perturbations, of, the, moon, and, the, other, planets, solar, timing, is, based, on, insolation, in, which, the, solstices, and, equinoxes, are, seen, as, the, midpoints, of, the, seasons, this, was, the, case, with, the, seasons, described, by, the, roman, scholar, varro, see, above, it, was, the, method, for, reckoning, seasons, in, medieval, europe, especially, by, the, celts, and, is, still, ceremonially, observed, in, ireland, and, some, east, asian, countries, summer, is, defined, as, the, quarter, of, the, year, with, the, greatest, insolation, and, winter, as, the, quarter, with, the, least, the, solar, seasons, change, at, the, cross, quarter, days, which, are, about, 3, 4, weeks, earlier, than, the, meteorological, seasons, and, 6, 7, weeks, earlier, than, seasons, starting, at, equinoxes, and, solstices, thus, the, day, of, greatest, insolation, is, designated, midsummer, as, noted, in, william, shakespeare, s, play, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, which, is, set, on, the, summer, solstice, on, the, celtic, calendar, the, start, of, the, seasons, corresponds, to, four, pagan, agricultural, festivals, the, traditional, first, day, of, winter, is, 1, november, samhain, the, celtic, origin, of, halloween, spring, starts, 1, february, celtic, imbolc, summer, begins, 1, may, beltane, the, celtic, origin, of, may, day, the, first, day, of, autumn, is, 1, august, celtic, lughnasadh, the, traditional, calendar, in, china, has, 4, seasons, based, on, 24, periods, twelve, of, which, are, called, zh, ngqi, and, twelve, of, which, are, known, as, ji, qi, these, periods, are, collectively, known, in, english, as, solar, terms, or, solar, breaths, the, four, seasons, ch, n, xi, qi, and, d, ng, translated, as, spring, summer, autumn, and, winter, each, center, on, the, respective, solstice, or, equinox, astronomically, the, seasons, are, said, to, begin, on, lichun, the, start, of, spring, on, about, 4, february, lixia, on, about, 6, may, liqiu, on, about, 8, august, and, lidong, on, about, 8, november, this, system, forms, the, basis, of, other, such, systems, in, east, asian, lunisolar, calendars, some, calendars, in, south, asia, use, a, six, season, partition, where, the, number, of, seasons, between, summer, and, winter, can, number, from, one, to, three, the, dates, are, fixed, at, even, intervals, of, months, in, the, hindu, calendar, of, tropical, and, subtropical, india, there, are, six, seasons, or, ritu, that, are, calendar, based, in, the, sense, of, having, fixed, dates, vasanta, spring, grishma, summer, varsha, monsoon, sharada, autumn, hemanta, early, winter, and, shishira, prevernal, or, late, winter, the, six, seasons, are, ascribed, to, two, months, each, of, the, twelve, months, in, the, hindu, calendar, the, rough, correspondences, are, the, bengali, calendar, is, similar, but, differs, in, start, and, end, times, it, has, the, following, seasons, or, ritu, the, odia, calendar, is, similar, but, differs, in, start, and, end, times, the, tamil, calendar, follows, a, similar, pattern, of, six, seasons, ecologically, speaking, a, season, is, a, period, of, the, year, in, which, only, certain, types, of, floral, and, animal, events, happen, e, g, flowers, bloom, spring, hedgehogs, hibernate, winter, so, if, a, change, in, daily, floral, and, animal, events, can, be, observed, the, season, is, changing, in, this, sense, ecological, seasons, are, defined, in, absolute, terms, unlike, calendar, based, methods, in, which, the, seasons, are, relative, if, specific, conditions, associated, with, a, particular, ecological, season, do, not, normally, occur, in, a, particular, region, then, that, area, cannot, be, said, to, experience, that, season, on, a, regular, basis, six, ecological, seasons, can, be, distinguished, without, fixed, calendar, based, dates, like, the, meteorological, and, astronomical, seasons, oceanic, regions, tend, to, experience, the, beginning, of, the, hibernal, season, up, to, a, month, later, than, continental, climates, conversely, prevernal, and, vernal, seasons, begin, up, to, a, month, earlier, near, oceanic, and, coastal, areas, for, example, prevernal, crocus, blooms, typically, appear, as, early, as, february, in, coastal, areas, of, british, columbia, the, british, isles, but, generally, do, not, appear, until, march, or, april, in, locations, like, the, midwestern, united, states, and, parts, of, eastern, europe, the, actual, dates, for, each, season, vary, by, climate, region, and, can, shift, from, one, year, to, the, next, average, dates, listed, here, are, for, mild, and, cool, temperate, climate, zones, in, the, northern, hemisphere, indigenous, people, in, polar, temperate, and, tropical, climates, of, northern, eurasia, the, americas, africa, oceania, and, australia, have, traditionally, defined, the, seasons, ecologically, by, observing, the, activity, of, the, plants, animals, and, weather, around, them, each, separate, tribal, group, traditionally, observes, different, seasons, determined, according, to, local, criteria, that, can, vary, from, the, hibernation, of, polar, bears, on, the, arctic, tundras, to, the, growing, seasons, of, plants, in, the, tropical, rainforests, in, australia, some, tribes, have, up, to, eight, seasons, in, a, year, as, do, the, sami, people, in, scandinavia, many, indigenous, people, who, no, longer, live, directly, off, the, land, in, traditional, often, nomadic, styles, now, observe, modern, methods, of, seasonal, reckoning, according, to, what, is, customary, in, their, particular, country, or, region, the, north, american, cree, and, possibly, other, algonquian, speaking, peoples, used, or, still, use, a, 6, season, system, the, extra, two, seasons, denoting, the, freezing, and, breaking, up, of, the, ice, on, rivers, and, lakes, the, noongar, people, of, south, west, western, australia, recognise, maar, keyen, bonar, or, six, seasons, each, season, s, arrival, is, heralded, not, by, a, calendar, date, but, by, environmental, factors, such, as, changing, winds, flowering, plants, temperature, and, migration, patterns, and, lasts, approximately, two, standard, calendar, months, the, seasons, also, correlate, to, aspects, of, the, human, condition, intrinsically, linking, the, lives, of, the, people, to, the, world, that, surrounds, them, and, also, dictating, their, movements, as, with, each, season, various, parts, of, country, would, be, visited, which, were, particularly, abundant, or, safe, from, the, elements, in, the, tropics, where, seasonal, dates, also, vary, it, is, more, common, to, speak, of, the, rainy, or, wet, or, monsoon, season, versus, the, dry, season, for, example, in, nicaragua, the, dry, season, november, to, april, is, called, summer, and, the, rainy, season, may, to, october, is, called, winter, even, though, it, is, located, in, the, northern, hemisphere, there, is, no, noticeable, change, in, the, amount, of, sunlight, at, different, times, of, the, year, instead, many, regions, such, as, the, northern, indian, ocean, have, varying, monsoon, rain, and, wind, cycles, floral, and, animal, activity, variation, near, the, equator, depends, more, on, wet, dry, cycles, than, seasonal, temperature, variations, with, different, species, flowering, or, emerging, from, cocoons, at, specific, times, before, during, or, after, the, monsoon, season, thus, the, tropics, are, characterized, by, numerous, mini, seasons, within, the, larger, seasonal, blocks, of, time, in, the, tropical, parts, of, australia, in, the, northern, parts, of, queensland, western, australia, and, the, northern, territory, wet, and, dry, seasons, are, observed, in, addition, to, or, in, place, of, temperate, season, names, the, most, historically, important, of, these, are, the, three, seasons, flood, growth, and, low, water, which, were, previously, defined, by, the, former, annual, flooding, of, the, nile, in, egypt, in, some, tropical, areas, a, three, way, division, into, hot, rainy, and, cool, season, is, used, in, thailand, three, seasons, are, recognised, any, point, north, of, the, arctic, circle, or, south, of, the, antarctic, circle, will, have, one, period, in, the, summer, called, polar, day, when, the, sun, does, not, set, and, one, period, in, the, winter, called, polar, night, when, the, sun, does, not, rise, at, progressively, higher, latitudes, the, maximum, periods, of, midnight, sun, and, polar, night, are, progressively, longer, for, example, at, the, military, and, weather, station, alert, located, at, 82, 30, 05, n, and, 62, 20, 20, w, on, the, northern, tip, of, ellesmere, island, canada, about, 450, nautical, miles, or, 830, km, from, the, north, pole, the, sun, begins, to, peek, above, the, horizon, for, minutes, per, day, at, the, end, of, february, and, each, day, it, climbs, higher, and, stays, up, longer, by, 21, march, the, sun, is, up, for, over, 12, hours, on, 6, april, the, sun, rises, at, 0522, utc, and, remains, above, the, horizon, until, it, sets, below, the, horizon, again, on, 6, september, at, 0335, utc, by, october, 13, the, sun, is, above, the, horizon, for, only, 1, hour, 30, minutes, and, on, october, 14, it, does, not, rise, above, the, horizon, at, all, and, remains, below, the, horizon, until, it, rises, again, on, 27, february, first, light, comes, in, late, january, because, the, sky, has, twilight, being, a, glow, on, the, horizon, for, increasing, hours, each, day, for, more, than, a, month, before, the, sun, first, appears, with, its, disc, above, the, horizon, from, mid, november, to, mid, january, there, is, no, twilight, in, the, weeks, surrounding, 21, june, in, the, northern, polar, region, the, sun, is, at, its, highest, elevation, appearing, to, circle, the, sky, there, without, going, below, the, horizon, eventually, it, does, go, below, the, horizon, for, progressively, longer, periods, each, day, until, around, the, middle, of, october, when, it, disappears, for, the, last, time, until, the, following, february, for, a, few, more, weeks, day, is, marked, by, decreasing, periods, of, twilight, eventually, from, mid, november, to, mid, january, there, is, no, twilight, and, it, is, continuously, dark, in, mid, january, the, first, faint, wash, of, twilight, briefly, touches, the, horizon, for, just, minutes, per, day, and, then, twilight, increases, in, duration, with, increasing, brightness, each, day, until, sunrise, at, end, of, february, then, on, 6, april, the, sun, remains, above, the, horizon, until, mid, october, seasonal, weather, and, climate, conditions, can, become, important, in, the, context, of, military, operations, seasonal, reckoning, in, the, military, of, any, country, or, region, tends, to, be, very, fluid, and, based, mainly, on, short, to, medium, term, weather, conditions, that, are, independent, of, the, calendar, for, navies, the, presence, of, accessible, ports, and, bases, can, allow, naval, operations, during, certain, variable, seasons, of, the, year, the, availability, of, ice, free, or, warm, water, ports, can, make, navies, much, more, effective, thus, russia, historically, navally, constrained, when, confined, to, using, arkhangelsk, before, the, 18th, century, and, even, kronstadt, has, particular, interests, in, maintaining, and, in, preserving, access, to, baltiysk, vladivostok, and, sevastopol, storm, seasons, or, polar, winter, weather, conditions, can, inhibit, surface, warships, at, sea, pre, modern, armies, especially, in, europe, tended, to, campaign, in, the, summer,
