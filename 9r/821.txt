a, vacuum, pl, vacuums, or, vacua, is, space, devoid, of, matter, the, word, is, derived, from, the, latin, adjective, vacuus, neuter, vacuum, meaning, vacant, or, void, an, approximation, to, such, vacuum, is, a, region, with, a, gaseous, pressure, much, less, than, atmospheric, pressure, physicists, often, discuss, ideal, test, results, that, would, occur, in, a, perfect, vacuum, which, they, sometimes, simply, call, vacuum, or, free, space, and, use, the, term, partial, vacuum, to, refer, to, an, actual, imperfect, vacuum, as, one, might, have, in, a, laboratory, or, in, space, in, engineering, and, applied, physics, on, the, other, hand, vacuum, refers, to, any, space, in, which, the, pressure, is, considerably, lower, than, atmospheric, pressure, the, latin, term, in, vacuo, is, used, to, describe, an, object, that, is, surrounded, by, a, vacuum, the, quality, of, a, partial, vacuum, refers, to, how, closely, it, approaches, a, perfect, vacuum, other, things, equal, lower, gas, pressure, means, higher, quality, vacuum, for, example, a, typical, vacuum, cleaner, produces, enough, suction, to, reduce, air, pressure, by, around, 20, but, higher, quality, vacuums, are, possible, ultra, high, vacuum, chambers, common, in, chemistry, physics, and, engineering, operate, below, one, trillionth, 10, 12, of, atmospheric, pressure, 100, npa, and, can, reach, around, 100, particles, cm, 3, outer, space, is, an, even, higher, quality, vacuum, with, the, equivalent, of, just, a, few, hydrogen, atoms, per, cubic, meter, on, average, in, intergalactic, space, vacuum, has, been, a, frequent, topic, of, philosophical, debate, since, ancient, greek, times, but, was, not, studied, empirically, until, the, 17th, century, clemens, timpler, 1605, philosophized, about, the, experimental, possibility, of, producing, a, vacuum, in, small, tubes, evangelista, torricelli, produced, the, first, laboratory, vacuum, in, 1643, and, other, experimental, techniques, were, developed, as, a, result, of, his, theories, of, atmospheric, pressure, a, torricellian, vacuum, is, created, by, filling, with, mercury, a, tall, glass, container, closed, at, one, end, and, then, inverting, it, in, a, bowl, to, contain, the, mercury, see, below, vacuum, became, a, valuable, industrial, tool, in, the, 20th, century, with, the, introduction, of, incandescent, light, bulbs, and, vacuum, tubes, and, a, wide, array, of, vacuum, technologies, has, since, become, available, the, development, of, human, spaceflight, has, raised, interest, in, the, impact, of, vacuum, on, human, health, and, on, life, forms, in, general, the, word, vacuum, comes, from, latin, an, empty, space, void, noun, use, of, neuter, of, vacuus, meaning, empty, related, to, vacare, meaning, to, be, empty, vacuum, is, one, of, the, few, words, in, the, english, language, that, contains, two, consecutive, instances, of, the, vowel, u, historically, there, has, been, much, dispute, over, whether, such, a, thing, as, a, vacuum, can, exist, ancient, greek, philosophers, debated, the, existence, of, a, vacuum, or, void, in, the, context, of, atomism, which, posited, void, and, atom, as, the, fundamental, explanatory, elements, of, physics, lucretius, argued, for, the, existence, of, vacuum, in, the, first, century, bc, and, hero, of, alexandria, tried, unsuccessfully, to, create, an, artificial, vacuum, in, the, first, century, ad, following, plato, however, even, the, abstract, concept, of, a, featureless, void, faced, considerable, skepticism, it, could, not, be, apprehended, by, the, senses, it, could, not, itself, provide, additional, explanatory, power, beyond, the, physical, volume, with, which, it, was, commensurate, and, by, definition, it, was, quite, literally, nothing, at, all, which, cannot, rightly, be, said, to, exist, aristotle, believed, that, no, void, could, occur, naturally, because, the, denser, surrounding, material, continuum, would, immediately, fill, any, incipient, rarity, that, might, give, rise, to, a, void, in, his, physics, book, iv, aristotle, offered, numerous, arguments, against, the, void, for, example, that, motion, through, a, medium, which, offered, no, impediment, could, continue, ad, infinitum, there, being, no, reason, that, something, would, come, to, rest, anywhere, in, particular, in, the, medieval, muslim, world, the, physicist, and, islamic, scholar, al, farabi, wrote, a, treatise, rejecting, the, existence, of, the, vacuum, in, the, 10th, century, he, concluded, that, air, s, volume, can, expand, to, fill, available, space, and, therefore, the, concept, of, a, perfect, vacuum, was, incoherent, according, to, ahmad, dallal, ab, rayh, n, al, b, r, n, states, that, there, is, no, observable, evidence, that, rules, out, the, possibility, of, vacuum, the, suction, pump, was, described, by, arab, engineer, al, jazari, in, the, 13th, century, and, later, appeared, in, europe, from, the, 15th, century, european, scholars, such, as, roger, bacon, blasius, of, parma, and, walter, burley, in, the, 13th, and, 14th, century, focused, considerable, attention, on, issues, concerning, the, concept, of, a, vacuum, the, commonly, held, view, that, nature, abhorred, a, vacuum, was, called, horror, vacui, there, was, even, speculation, that, even, god, could, not, create, a, vacuum, if, he, wanted, and, the, 1277, paris, condemnations, of, bishop, tienne, tempier, which, required, there, to, be, no, restrictions, on, the, powers, of, god, led, to, the, conclusion, that, god, could, create, a, vacuum, if, he, so, wished, from, the, 14th, century, onward, increasingly, departed, from, the, aristotelian, perspective, scholars, widely, acknowledged, that, a, supernatural, void, exists, beyond, the, confines, of, the, cosmos, itself, by, the, 17th, century, this, idea, influenced, by, stoic, physics, helped, to, segregate, natural, and, theological, concerns, almost, two, thousand, years, after, plato, ren, descartes, also, proposed, a, geometrically, based, alternative, theory, of, atomism, without, the, problematic, nothing, everything, dichotomy, of, void, and, atom, although, descartes, agreed, with, the, contemporary, position, that, a, vacuum, does, not, occur, in, nature, the, success, of, his, namesake, coordinate, system, and, more, implicitly, the, spatial, corporeal, component, of, his, metaphysics, would, come, to, define, the, philosophically, modern, notion, of, empty, space, as, a, quantified, extension, of, volume, by, the, ancient, definition, however, directional, information, and, magnitude, were, conceptually, distinct, medieval, thought, experiments, into, the, idea, of, a, vacuum, considered, whether, a, vacuum, was, present, if, only, for, an, instant, between, two, flat, plates, when, they, were, rapidly, separated, there, was, much, discussion, of, whether, the, air, moved, in, quickly, enough, as, the, plates, were, separated, or, as, walter, burley, postulated, whether, a, celestial, agent, prevented, the, vacuum, arising, jean, buridan, reported, in, the, 14th, century, that, teams, of, ten, horses, could, not, pull, open, bellows, when, the, port, was, sealed, the, 17th, century, saw, the, first, attempts, to, quantify, measurements, of, partial, vacuum, evangelista, torricelli, s, mercury, barometer, of, 1643, and, blaise, pascal, s, experiments, both, demonstrated, a, partial, vacuum, in, 1654, otto, von, guericke, invented, the, first, vacuum, pump, and, conducted, his, famous, magdeburg, hemispheres, experiment, showing, that, owing, to, atmospheric, pressure, outside, the, hemispheres, teams, of, horses, could, not, separate, two, hemispheres, from, which, the, air, had, been, partially, evacuated, robert, boyle, improved, guericke, s, design, and, with, the, help, of, robert, hooke, further, developed, vacuum, pump, technology, thereafter, research, into, the, partial, vacuum, lapsed, until, 1850, when, august, toepler, invented, the, toepler, pump, and, in, 1855, when, heinrich, geissler, invented, the, mercury, displacement, pump, achieving, a, partial, vacuum, of, about, 10, pa, 0, 1, torr, a, number, of, electrical, properties, become, observable, at, this, vacuum, level, which, renewed, interest, in, further, research, while, outer, space, provides, the, most, rarefied, example, of, a, naturally, occurring, partial, vacuum, the, heavens, were, originally, thought, to, be, seamlessly, filled, by, a, rigid, indestructible, material, called, aether, borrowing, somewhat, from, the, pneuma, of, stoic, physics, aether, came, to, be, regarded, as, the, rarefied, air, from, which, it, took, its, name, see, aether, mythology, early, theories, of, light, posited, a, ubiquitous, terrestrial, and, celestial, medium, through, which, light, propagated, additionally, the, concept, informed, isaac, newton, s, explanations, of, both, refraction, and, of, radiant, heat, 19th, century, experiments, into, this, luminiferous, aether, attempted, to, detect, a, minute, drag, on, the, earth, s, orbit, while, the, earth, does, in, fact, move, through, a, relatively, dense, medium, in, comparison, to, that, of, interstellar, space, the, drag, is, so, minuscule, that, it, could, not, be, detected, in, 1912, astronomer, henry, pickering, commented, while, the, interstellar, absorbing, medium, may, be, simply, the, ether, is, characteristic, of, a, gas, and, free, gaseous, molecules, are, certainly, there, thereafter, however, luminiferous, aether, was, discarded, later, in, 1930, paul, dirac, proposed, a, model, of, the, vacuum, as, an, infinite, sea, of, particles, possessing, negative, energy, called, the, dirac, sea, this, theory, helped, refine, the, predictions, of, his, earlier, formulated, dirac, equation, and, successfully, predicted, the, existence, of, the, positron, confirmed, two, years, later, werner, heisenberg, s, uncertainty, principle, formulated, in, 1927, predicted, a, fundamental, limit, within, which, instantaneous, position, and, momentum, or, energy, and, time, can, be, measured, this, far, reaching, consequences, also, threatened, whether, the, emptiness, of, space, between, particles, exists, the, strictest, criterion, to, define, a, vacuum, is, a, region, of, space, and, time, where, all, the, components, of, the, stress, energy, tensor, are, zero, this, means, that, this, region, is, devoid, of, energy, and, momentum, and, by, consequence, it, must, be, empty, of, particles, and, other, physical, fields, such, as, electromagnetism, that, contain, energy, and, momentum, in, general, relativity, a, vanishing, stress, energy, tensor, implies, through, einstein, field, equations, the, vanishing, of, all, the, components, of, the, ricci, tensor, vacuum, does, not, mean, that, the, curvature, of, space, time, is, necessarily, flat, the, gravitational, field, can, still, produce, curvature, in, a, vacuum, in, the, form, of, tidal, forces, and, gravitational, waves, technically, these, phenomena, are, the, components, of, the, weyl, tensor, the, black, hole, with, zero, electric, charge, is, an, elegant, example, of, a, region, completely, filled, with, vacuum, but, still, showing, a, strong, curvature, in, classical, electromagnetism, the, vacuum, of, free, space, or, sometimes, just, free, space, or, perfect, vacuum, is, a, standard, reference, medium, for, electromagnetic, effects, some, authors, refer, to, this, reference, medium, as, classical, vacuum, a, terminology, intended, to, separate, this, concept, from, qed, vacuum, or, qcd, vacuum, where, vacuum, fluctuations, can, produce, transient, virtual, particle, densities, and, a, relative, permittivity, and, relative, permeability, that, are, not, identically, unity, in, the, theory, of, classical, electromagnetism, free, space, has, the, following, properties, the, vacuum, of, classical, electromagnetism, can, be, viewed, as, an, idealized, electromagnetic, medium, with, the, constitutive, relations, in, si, units, relating, the, electric, displacement, field, d, to, the, electric, field, e, and, the, magnetic, field, or, h, field, h, to, the, magnetic, induction, or, b, field, b, here, r, is, a, spatial, location, and, t, is, time, in, quantum, mechanics, and, quantum, field, theory, the, vacuum, is, defined, as, the, state, that, is, the, solution, to, the, equations, of, the, theory, with, the, lowest, possible, energy, the, ground, state, of, the, hilbert, space, in, quantum, electrodynamics, this, vacuum, is, referred, to, as, qed, vacuum, to, distinguish, it, from, the, vacuum, of, quantum, chromodynamics, denoted, as, qcd, vacuum, qed, vacuum, is, a, state, with, no, matter, particles, hence, the, name, and, no, photons, as, described, above, this, state, is, impossible, to, achieve, experimentally, even, if, every, matter, particle, could, somehow, be, removed, from, a, volume, it, would, be, impossible, to, eliminate, all, the, blackbody, photons, nonetheless, it, provides, a, good, model, for, realizable, vacuum, and, agrees, with, a, number, of, experimental, observations, as, described, next, qed, vacuum, has, interesting, and, complex, properties, in, qed, vacuum, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, have, zero, average, values, but, their, variances, are, not, zero, as, a, result, qed, vacuum, contains, vacuum, fluctuations, virtual, particles, that, hop, into, and, out, of, existence, and, a, finite, energy, called, vacuum, energy, vacuum, fluctuations, are, an, essential, and, ubiquitous, part, of, quantum, field, theory, some, experimentally, verified, effects, of, vacuum, fluctuations, include, spontaneous, emission, and, the, lamb, shift, coulomb, s, law, and, the, electric, potential, in, vacuum, near, an, electric, charge, are, modified, theoretically, in, qcd, multiple, vacuum, states, can, coexist, the, starting, and, ending, of, cosmological, inflation, is, thought, to, have, arisen, from, transitions, between, different, vacuum, states, for, theories, obtained, by, quantization, of, a, classical, theory, each, stationary, point, of, the, energy, in, the, configuration, space, gives, rise, to, a, single, vacuum, string, theory, is, believed, to, have, a, huge, number, of, vacua, the, so, called, string, theory, landscape, outer, space, has, very, low, density, and, pressure, and, is, the, closest, physical, approximation, of, a, perfect, vacuum, but, no, vacuum, is, truly, perfect, not, even, in, interstellar, space, where, there, are, still, a, few, hydrogen, atoms, per, cubic, meter, stars, planets, and, moons, keep, their, atmospheres, by, gravitational, attraction, and, as, such, atmospheres, have, no, clearly, delineated, boundary, the, density, of, atmospheric, gas, simply, decreases, with, distance, from, the, object, the, earth, s, atmospheric, pressure, drops, to, about, 32, millipascals, 4, 6, 10, 6, psi, at, 100, kilometres, 62, mi, of, altitude, the, k, rm, n, line, which, is, a, common, definition, of, the, boundary, with, outer, space, beyond, this, line, isotropic, gas, pressure, rapidly, becomes, insignificant, when, compared, to, radiation, pressure, from, the, sun, and, the, dynamic, pressure, of, the, solar, winds, so, the, definition, of, pressure, becomes, difficult, to, interpret, the, thermosphere, in, this, range, has, large, gradients, of, pressure, temperature, and, composition, and, varies, greatly, due, to, space, weather, astrophysicists, prefer, to, use, number, density, to, describe, these, environments, in, units, of, particles, per, cubic, centimetre, but, although, it, meets, the, definition, of, outer, space, the, atmospheric, density, within, the, first, few, hundred, kilometers, above, the, k, rm, n, line, is, still, sufficient, to, produce, significant, drag, on, satellites, most, artificial, satellites, operate, in, this, region, called, low, earth, orbit, and, must, fire, their, engines, every, couple, of, weeks, or, a, few, times, a, year, depending, on, solar, activity, the, drag, here, is, low, enough, that, it, could, theoretically, be, overcome, by, radiation, pressure, on, solar, sails, a, proposed, propulsion, system, for, interplanetary, travel, all, of, the, observable, universe, is, filled, with, large, numbers, of, photons, the, so, called, cosmic, background, radiation, and, quite, likely, a, correspondingly, large, number, of, neutrinos, the, current, temperature, of, this, radiation, is, about, 3, k, 270, 15, c, 454, 27, f, the, quality, of, a, vacuum, is, indicated, by, the, amount, of, matter, remaining, in, the, system, so, that, a, high, quality, vacuum, is, one, with, very, little, matter, left, in, it, vacuum, is, primarily, measured, by, its, absolute, pressure, but, a, complete, characterization, requires, further, parameters, such, as, temperature, and, chemical, composition, one, of, the, most, important, parameters, is, the, mean, free, path, mfp, of, residual, gases, which, indicates, the, average, distance, that, molecules, will, travel, between, collisions, with, each, other, as, the, gas, density, decreases, the, mfp, increases, and, when, the, mfp, is, longer, than, the, chamber, pump, spacecraft, or, other, objects, present, the, continuum, assumptions, of, fluid, mechanics, do, not, apply, this, vacuum, state, is, called, high, vacuum, and, the, study, of, fluid, flows, in, this, regime, is, called, particle, gas, dynamics, the, mfp, of, air, at, atmospheric, pressure, is, very, short, 70, nm, but, at, 100, mpa, 10, 3, torr, the, mfp, of, room, temperature, air, is, roughly, 100, mm, which, is, on, the, order, of, everyday, objects, such, as, vacuum, tubes, the, crookes, radiometer, turns, when, the, mfp, is, larger, than, the, size, of, the, vanes, vacuum, quality, is, subdivided, into, ranges, according, to, the, technology, required, to, achieve, it, or, measure, it, these, ranges, were, defined, in, iso, 3529, 1, 2019, as, shown, in, the, following, table, 100, pa, corresponds, to, 0, 75, torr, torr, is, a, non, si, unit, vacuum, is, measured, in, units, of, pressure, typically, as, a, subtraction, relative, to, ambient, atmospheric, pressure, on, earth, but, the, amount, of, relative, measurable, vacuum, varies, with, local, conditions, on, the, surface, of, venus, where, ground, level, atmospheric, pressure, is, much, higher, than, on, earth, much, higher, relative, vacuum, readings, would, be, possible, on, the, surface, of, the, moon, with, almost, no, atmosphere, it, would, be, extremely, difficult, to, create, a, measurable, vacuum, relative, to, the, local, environment, similarly, much, higher, than, normal, relative, vacuum, readings, are, possible, deep, in, the, earth, s, ocean, a, submarine, maintaining, an, internal, pressure, of, 1, atmosphere, submerged, to, a, depth, of, 10, atmospheres, 98, metres, a, 9, 8, metre, column, of, seawater, has, the, equivalent, weight, of, 1, atm, is, effectively, a, vacuum, chamber, keeping, out, the, crushing, exterior, water, pressures, though, the, 1, atm, inside, the, submarine, would, not, normally, be, considered, a, vacuum, therefore, to, properly, understand, the, following, discussions, of, vacuum, measurement, it, is, important, that, the, reader, assumes, the, relative, measurements, are, being, done, on, earth, at, sea, level, at, exactly, 1, atmosphere, of, ambient, atmospheric, pressure, the, si, unit, of, pressure, is, the, pascal, symbol, pa, but, vacuum, is, often, measured, in, torrs, named, for, an, italian, physicist, torricelli, 1608, 1647, a, torr, is, equal, to, the, displacement, of, a, millimeter, of, mercury, mmhg, in, a, manometer, with, 1, torr, equaling, 133, 3223684, pascals, above, absolute, zero, pressure, vacuum, is, often, also, measured, on, the, barometric, scale, or, as, a, percentage, of, atmospheric, pressure, in, bars, or, atmospheres, low, vacuum, is, often, measured, in, millimeters, of, mercury, mmhg, or, pascals, pa, below, standard, atmospheric, pressure, below, atmospheric, means, that, the, absolute, pressure, is, equal, to, the, current, atmospheric, pressure, in, other, words, most, low, vacuum, gauges, that, read, for, example, 50, 79, torr, many, inexpensive, low, vacuum, gauges, have, a, margin, of, error, and, may, report, a, vacuum, of, 0, torr, but, in, practice, this, generally, requires, a, two, stage, rotary, vane, or, other, medium, type, of, vacuum, pump, to, go, much, beyond, lower, than, 1, torr, many, devices, are, used, to, measure, the, pressure, in, a, vacuum, depending, on, what, range, of, vacuum, is, needed, hydrostatic, gauges, such, as, the, mercury, column, manometer, consist, of, a, vertical, column, of, liquid, in, a, tube, whose, ends, are, exposed, to, different, pressures, the, column, will, rise, or, fall, until, its, weight, is, in, equilibrium, with, the, pressure, differential, between, the, two, ends, of, the, tube, the, simplest, design, is, a, closed, end, u, shaped, tube, one, side, of, which, is, connected, to, the, region, of, interest, any, fluid, can, be, used, but, mercury, is, preferred, for, its, high, density, and, low, vapour, pressure, simple, hydrostatic, gauges, can, measure, pressures, ranging, from, 1, torr, 100, pa, to, above, atmospheric, an, important, variation, is, the, mcleod, gauge, which, isolates, a, known, volume, of, vacuum, and, compresses, it, to, multiply, the, height, variation, of, the, liquid, column, the, mcleod, gauge, can, measure, vacuums, as, high, as, 10, 6, torr, 0, 1, mpa, which, is, the, lowest, direct, measurement, of, pressure, that, is, possible, with, current, technology, other, vacuum, gauges, can, measure, lower, pressures, but, only, indirectly, by, measurement, of, other, pressure, controlled, properties, these, indirect, measurements, must, be, calibrated, via, a, direct, measurement, most, commonly, a, mcleod, gauge, the, kenotometer, is, a, particular, type, of, hydrostatic, gauge, typically, used, in, power, plants, using, steam, turbines, the, kenotometer, measures, the, vacuum, in, the, steam, space, of, the, condenser, that, is, the, exhaust, of, the, last, stage, of, the, turbine, mechanical, or, elastic, gauges, depend, on, a, bourdon, tube, diaphragm, or, capsule, usually, made, of, metal, which, will, change, shape, in, response, to, the, pressure, of, the, region, in, question, a, variation, on, this, idea, is, the, capacitance, manometer, in, which, the, diaphragm, makes, up, a, part, of, a, capacitor, a, change, in, pressure, leads, to, the, flexure, of, the, diaphragm, which, results, in, a, change, in, capacitance, these, gauges, are, effective, from, 10, 3, torr, to, 10, 4, torr, and, beyond, thermal, conductivity, gauges, rely, on, the, fact, that, the, ability, of, a, gas, to, conduct, heat, decreases, with, pressure, in, this, type, of, gauge, a, wire, filament, is, heated, by, running, current, through, it, a, thermocouple, or, resistance, temperature, detector, rtd, can, then, be, used, to, measure, the, temperature, of, the, filament, this, temperature, is, dependent, on, the, rate, at, which, the, filament, loses, heat, to, the, surrounding, gas, and, therefore, on, the, thermal, conductivity, a, common, variant, is, the, pirani, gauge, which, uses, a, single, platinum, filament, as, both, the, heated, element, and, rtd, these, gauges, are, accurate, from, 10, torr, to, 10, 3, torr, but, they, are, sensitive, to, the, chemical, composition, of, the, gases, being, measured, ionization, gauges, are, used, in, ultrahigh, vacuum, they, come, in, two, types, hot, cathode, and, cold, cathode, in, the, hot, cathode, version, an, electrically, heated, filament, produces, an, electron, beam, the, electrons, travel, through, the, gauge, and, ionize, gas, molecules, around, them, the, resulting, ions, are, collected, at, a, negative, electrode, the, current, depends, on, the, number, of, ions, which, depends, on, the, pressure, in, the, gauge, hot, cathode, gauges, are, accurate, from, 10, 3, torr, to, 10, 10, torr, the, principle, behind, cold, cathode, version, is, the, same, except, that, electrons, are, produced, in, a, discharge, created, by, a, high, voltage, electrical, discharge, cold, cathode, gauges, are, accurate, from, 10, 2, torr, to, 10, 9, torr, ionization, gauge, calibration, is, very, sensitive, to, construction, geometry, chemical, composition, of, gases, being, measured, corrosion, and, surface, deposits, their, calibration, can, be, invalidated, by, activation, at, atmospheric, pressure, or, low, vacuum, the, composition, of, gases, at, high, vacuums, will, usually, be, unpredictable, so, a, mass, spectrometer, must, be, used, in, conjunction, with, the, ionization, gauge, for, accurate, measurement, vacuum, is, useful, in, a, variety, of, processes, and, devices, its, first, widespread, use, was, in, the, incandescent, light, bulb, to, protect, the, filament, from, chemical, degradation, the, chemical, inertness, produced, by, a, vacuum, is, also, useful, for, electron, beam, welding, cold, welding, vacuum, packing, and, vacuum, frying, ultra, high, vacuum, is, used, in, the, study, of, atomically, clean, substrates, as, only, a, very, good, vacuum, preserves, atomic, scale, clean, surfaces, for, a, reasonably, long, time, on, the, order, of, minutes, to, days, high, to, ultra, high, vacuum, removes, the, obstruction, of, air, allowing, particle, beams, to, deposit, or, remove, materials, without, contamination, this, is, the, principle, behind, chemical, vapor, deposition, physical, vapor, deposition, and, dry, etching, which, are, essential, to, the, fabrication, of, semiconductors, and, optical, coatings, and, to, surface, science, the, reduction, of, convection, provides, the, thermal, insulation, of, thermos, bottles, deep, vacuum, lowers, the, boiling, point, of, liquids, and, promotes, low, temperature, outgassing, which, is, used, in, freeze, drying, adhesive, preparation, distillation, metallurgy, and, process, purging, the, electrical, properties, of, vacuum, make, electron, microscopes, and, vacuum, tubes, possible, including, cathode, ray, tubes, vacuum, interrupters, are, used, in, electrical, switchgear, vacuum, arc, processes, are, industrially, important, for, production, of, certain, grades, of, steel, or, high, purity, materials, the, elimination, of, air, friction, is, useful, for, flywheel, energy, storage, and, ultracentrifuges, vacuums, are, commonly, used, to, produce, suction, which, has, an, even, wider, variety, of, applications, the, newcomen, steam, engine, used, vacuum, instead, of, pressure, to, drive, a, piston, in, the, 19th, century, vacuum, was, used, for, traction, on, isambard, kingdom, brunel, s, experimental, atmospheric, railway, vacuum, brakes, were, once, widely, used, on, trains, in, the, uk, but, except, on, heritage, railways, they, have, been, replaced, by, air, brakes, manifold, vacuum, can, be, used, to, drive, accessories, on, automobiles, the, best, known, application, is, the, vacuum, servo, used, to, provide, power, assistance, for, the, brakes, obsolete, applications, include, vacuum, driven, windscreen, wipers, and, autovac, fuel, pumps, some, aircraft, instruments, attitude, indicator, ai, and, the, heading, indicator, hi, are, typically, vacuum, powered, as, protection, against, loss, of, all, electrically, powered, instruments, since, early, aircraft, often, did, not, have, electrical, systems, and, since, there, are, two, readily, available, sources, of, vacuum, on, a, moving, aircraft, the, engine, and, an, external, venturi, vacuum, induction, melting, uses, electromagnetic, induction, within, a, vacuum, maintaining, a, vacuum, in, the, condenser, is, an, important, aspect, of, the, efficient, operation, of, steam, turbines, a, steam, jet, ejector, or, liquid, ring, vacuum, pump, is, used, for, this, purpose, the, typical, vacuum, maintained, in, the, condenser, steam, space, at, the, exhaust, of, the, turbine, also, called, condenser, backpressure, is, in, the, range, 5, to, 15, kpa, absolute, depending, on, the, type, of, condenser, and, the, ambient, conditions, evaporation, and, sublimation, into, a, vacuum, is, called, outgassing, all, materials, solid, or, liquid, have, a, small, vapour, pressure, and, their, outgassing, becomes, important, when, the, vacuum, pressure, falls, below, this, vapour, pressure, outgassing, has, the, same, effect, as, a, leak, and, will, limit, the, achievable, vacuum, outgassing, products, may, condense, on, nearby, colder, surfaces, which, can, be, troublesome, if, they, obscure, optical, instruments, or, react, with, other, materials, this, is, of, great, concern, to, space, missions, where, an, obscured, telescope, or, solar, cell, can, ruin, an, expensive, mission, the, most, prevalent, outgassing, product, in, vacuum, systems, is, water, absorbed, by, chamber, materials, it, can, be, reduced, by, desiccating, or, baking, the, chamber, and, removing, absorbent, materials, outgassed, water, can, condense, in, the, oil, of, rotary, vane, pumps, and, reduce, their, net, speed, drastically, if, gas, ballasting, is, not, used, high, vacuum, systems, must, be, clean, and, free, of, organic, matter, to, minimize, outgassing, ultra, high, vacuum, systems, are, usually, baked, preferably, under, vacuum, to, temporarily, raise, the, vapour, pressure, of, all, outgassing, materials, and, boil, them, off, once, the, bulk, of, the, outgassing, materials, are, boiled, off, and, evacuated, the, system, may, be, cooled, to, lower, vapour, pressures, and, minimize, residual, outgassing, during, actual, operation, some, systems, are, cooled, well, below, room, temperature, by, liquid, nitrogen, to, shut, down, residual, outgassing, and, simultaneously, cryopump, the, system, fluids, cannot, generally, be, pulled, so, a, vacuum, cannot, be, created, by, suction, suction, can, spread, and, dilute, a, vacuum, by, letting, a, higher, pressure, push, fluids, into, it, but, the, vacuum, has, to, be, created, first, before, suction, can, occur, the, easiest, way, to, create, an, artificial, vacuum, is, to, expand, the, volume, of, a, container, for, example, the, diaphragm, muscle, expands, the, chest, cavity, which, causes, the, volume, of, the, lungs, to, increase, this, expansion, reduces, the, pressure, and, creates, a, partial, vacuum, which, is, soon, filled, by, air, pushed, in, by, atmospheric, pressure, to, continue, evacuating, a, chamber, indefinitely, without, requiring, infinite, growth, a, compartment, of, the, vacuum, can, be, repeatedly, closed, off, exhausted, and, expanded, again, this, is, the, principle, behind, positive, displacement, pumps, like, the, manual, water, pump, for, example, inside, the, pump, a, mechanism, expands, a, small, sealed, cavity, to, create, a, vacuum, because, of, the, pressure, differential, some, fluid, from, the, chamber, or, the, well, in, our, example, is, pushed, into, the, pump, s, small, cavity, the, pump, s, cavity, is, then, sealed, from, the, chamber, opened, to, the, atmosphere, and, squeezed, back, to, a, minute, size, the, above, explanation, is, merely, a, simple, introduction, to, vacuum, pumping, and, is, not, representative, of, the, entire, range, of, pumps, in, use, many, variations, of, the, positive, displacement, pump, have, been, developed, and, many, other, pump, designs, rely, on, fundamentally, different, principles, momentum, transfer, pumps, which, bear, some, similarities, to, dynamic, pumps, used, at, higher, pressures, can, achieve, much, higher, quality, vacuums, than, positive, displacement, pumps, entrapment, pumps, can, capture, gases, in, a, solid, or, absorbed, state, often, with, no, moving, parts, no, seals, and, no, vibration, none, of, these, pumps, are, universal, each, type, has, important, performance, limitations, they, all, share, a, difficulty, in, pumping, low, molecular, weight, gases, especially, hydrogen, helium, and, neon, the, lowest, pressure, that, can, be, attained, in, a, system, is, also, dependent, on, many, things, other, than, the, nature, of, the, pumps, multiple, pumps, may, be, connected, in, series, called, stages, to, achieve, higher, vacuums, the, choice, of, seals, chamber, geometry, materials, and, pump, down, procedures, will, all, have, an, impact, collectively, these, are, called, vacuum, technique, and, sometimes, the, final, pressure, is, not, the, only, relevant, characteristic, pumping, systems, differ, in, oil, contamination, vibration, preferential, pumping, of, certain, gases, pump, down, speeds, intermittent, duty, cycle, reliability, or, tolerance, to, high, leakage, rates, in, ultra, high, vacuum, systems, some, very, odd, leakage, paths, and, outgassing, sources, must, be, considered, the, water, absorption, of, aluminium, and, palladium, becomes, an, unacceptable, source, of, outgassing, and, even, the, adsorptivity, of, hard, metals, such, as, stainless, steel, or, titanium, must, be, considered, some, oils, and, greases, will, boil, off, in, extreme, vacuums, the, permeability, of, the, metallic, chamber, walls, may, have, to, be, considered, and, the, grain, direction, of, the, metallic, flanges, should, be, parallel, to, the, flange, face, the, lowest, pressures, currently, achievable, in, laboratory, are, about, 1, 10, 13, torrs, 13, ppa, however, pressures, as, low, as, 5, 10, 17, torrs, 6, 7, fpa, have, been, indirectly, measured, in, a, 4, k, 269, 15, c, 452, 47, f, cryogenic, vacuum, system, this, corresponds, to, 100, particles, cm, 3, humans, and, animals, exposed, to, vacuum, will, lose, consciousness, after, a, few, seconds, and, die, of, hypoxia, within, minutes, but, the, symptoms, are, not, nearly, as, graphic, as, commonly, depicted, in, media, and, popular, culture, the, reduction, in, pressure, lowers, the, temperature, at, which, blood, and, other, body, fluids, boil, but, the, elastic, pressure, of, blood, vessels, ensures, that, this, boiling, point, remains, above, the, internal, body, temperature, of, 37, c, although, the, blood, will, not, boil, the, formation, of, gas, bubbles, in, bodily, fluids, at, reduced, pressures, known, as, ebullism, is, still, a, concern, the, gas, may, bloat, the, body, to, twice, its, normal, size, and, slow, circulation, but, tissues, are, elastic, and, porous, enough, to, prevent, rupture, swelling, and, ebullism, can, be, restrained, by, containment, in, a, flight, suit, shuttle, astronauts, wore, a, fitted, elastic, garment, called, the, crew, altitude, protection, suit, caps, which, prevents, ebullism, at, pressures, as, low, as, 2, kpa, 15, torr, rapid, boiling, will, cool, the, skin, and, create, frost, particularly, in, the, mouth, but, this, is, not, a, significant, hazard, animal, experiments, show, that, rapid, and, complete, recovery, is, normal, for, exposures, shorter, than, 90, seconds, while, longer, full, body, exposures, are, fatal, and, resuscitation, has, never, been, successful, a, study, by, nasa, on, eight, chimpanzees, found, all, of, them, survived, two, and, a, half, minute, exposures, to, vacuum, there, is, only, a, limited, amount, of, data, available, from, human, accidents, but, it, is, consistent, with, animal, data, limbs, may, be, exposed, for, much, longer, if, breathing, is, not, impaired, robert, boyle, was, the, first, to, show, in, 1660, that, vacuum, is, lethal, to, small, animals, an, experiment, indicates, that, plants, are, able, to, survive, in, a, low, pressure, environment, 1, 5, kpa, for, about, 30, minutes, cold, or, oxygen, rich, atmospheres, can, sustain, life, at, pressures, much, lower, than, atmospheric, as, long, as, the, density, of, oxygen, is, similar, to, that, of, standard, sea, level, atmosphere, the, colder, air, temperatures, found, at, altitudes, of, up, to, 3, km, generally, compensate, for, the, lower, pressures, there, above, this, altitude, oxygen, enrichment, is, necessary, to, prevent, altitude, sickness, in, humans, that, did, not, undergo, prior, acclimatization, and, spacesuits, are, necessary, to, prevent, ebullism, above, 19, km, most, spacesuits, use, only, 20, kpa, 150, torr, of, pure, oxygen, this, pressure, is, high, enough, to, prevent, ebullism, but, decompression, sickness, and, gas, embolisms, can, still, occur, if, decompression, rates, are, not, managed, rapid, decompression, can, be, much, more, dangerous, than, vacuum, exposure, itself, even, if, the, victim, does, not, hold, his, or, her, breath, venting, through, the, windpipe, may, be, too, slow, to, prevent, the, fatal, rupture, of, the, delicate, alveoli, of, the, lungs, eardrums, and, sinuses, may, be, ruptured, by, rapid, decompression, soft, tissues, may, bruise, and, seep, blood, and, the, stress, of, shock, will, accelerate, oxygen, consumption, leading, to, hypoxia, injuries, caused, by, rapid, decompression, are, called, barotrauma, a, pressure, drop, of, 13, kpa, 100, torr, which, produces, no, symptoms, if, it, is, gradual, may, be, fatal, if, it, occurs, suddenly, some, extremophile, microorganisms, such, as, tardigrades, can, survive, vacuum, conditions, for, periods, of, days, or, weeks
