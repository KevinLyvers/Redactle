magnesium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, mg, and, atomic, number, 12, it, is, a, shiny, gray, metal, having, a, low, density, low, melting, point, and, high, chemical, reactivity, like, the, other, alkaline, earth, metals, group, 2, of, the, periodic, table, it, occurs, naturally, only, in, combination, with, other, elements, and, it, almost, always, has, an, oxidation, state, of, 2, it, reacts, readily, with, air, to, form, a, thin, passivation, coating, of, magnesium, oxide, that, inhibits, further, corrosion, of, the, metal, the, free, metal, burns, with, a, brilliant, white, light, the, metal, is, obtained, mainly, by, electrolysis, of, magnesium, salts, obtained, from, brine, it, is, less, dense, than, aluminium, and, is, used, primarily, as, a, component, in, strong, and, lightweight, alloys, that, contain, aluminium, in, the, cosmos, magnesium, is, produced, in, large, aging, stars, by, the, sequential, addition, of, three, helium, nuclei, to, a, carbon, nucleus, when, such, stars, explode, as, supernovas, much, of, the, magnesium, is, expelled, into, the, interstellar, medium, where, it, may, recycle, into, new, star, systems, magnesium, is, the, eighth, most, abundant, element, in, the, earth, s, crust, and, the, fourth, most, common, element, in, the, earth, after, iron, oxygen, and, silicon, making, up, 13, of, the, planet, s, mass, and, a, large, fraction, of, the, planet, s, mantle, it, is, the, third, most, abundant, element, dissolved, in, seawater, after, sodium, and, chlorine, this, element, is, the, eleventh, most, abundant, element, by, mass, in, the, human, body, and, is, essential, to, all, cells, and, some, 300, enzymes, magnesium, ions, interact, with, polyphosphate, compounds, such, as, atp, dna, and, rna, hundreds, of, enzymes, require, magnesium, ions, to, function, magnesium, compounds, are, used, medicinally, as, common, laxatives, and, antacids, such, as, milk, of, magnesia, and, to, stabilize, abnormal, nerve, excitation, or, blood, vessel, spasm, in, such, conditions, as, eclampsia, elemental, magnesium, is, a, gray, white, lightweight, metal, two, thirds, the, density, of, aluminium, magnesium, has, the, lowest, melting, 923, k, 650, c, and, the, lowest, boiling, point, 1, 363, k, 1, 090, c, of, all, the, alkaline, earth, metals, pure, polycrystalline, magnesium, is, brittle, and, easily, fractures, along, shear, bands, it, becomes, much, more, malleable, when, alloyed, with, small, amounts, of, other, metals, such, as, 1, aluminium, the, malleability, of, polycrystalline, magnesium, can, also, be, significantly, improved, by, reducing, its, grain, size, to, ca, 1, micron, or, less, when, finely, powdered, magnesium, reacts, with, water, to, produce, hydrogen, gas, however, this, reaction, is, much, less, dramatic, than, the, reactions, of, the, alkali, metals, with, water, because, the, magnesium, hydroxide, builds, up, on, the, surface, of, the, magnesium, metal, and, inhibits, further, reaction, the, principal, property, of, magnesium, metal, is, its, reducing, power, one, hint, is, that, it, tarnishes, slightly, when, exposed, to, air, although, unlike, the, heavier, alkaline, earth, metals, an, oxygen, free, environment, is, unnecessary, for, storage, because, magnesium, is, protected, by, a, thin, layer, of, oxide, that, is, fairly, impermeable, and, difficult, to, remove, direct, reaction, of, magnesium, with, air, or, oxygen, at, ambient, pressure, forms, only, the, normal, oxide, mgo, however, this, oxide, may, be, combined, with, hydrogen, peroxide, to, form, magnesium, peroxide, mgo, 2, and, at, low, temperature, the, peroxide, may, be, further, reacted, with, ozone, to, form, magnesium, superoxide, mg, o, 2, 2, magnesium, reacts, with, water, at, room, temperature, though, it, reacts, much, more, slowly, than, calcium, a, similar, group, 2, metal, when, submerged, in, water, hydrogen, bubbles, form, slowly, on, the, surface, of, the, metal, this, reaction, happens, much, more, rapidly, with, powdered, magnesium, the, reaction, also, occurs, faster, with, higher, temperatures, see, safety, precautions, magnesium, s, reversible, reaction, with, water, can, be, harnessed, to, store, energy, and, run, a, magnesium, based, engine, magnesium, also, reacts, exothermically, with, most, acids, such, as, hydrochloric, acid, hcl, producing, magnesium, chloride, and, hydrogen, gas, similar, to, the, hcl, reaction, with, aluminium, zinc, and, many, other, metals, although, it, is, difficult, to, ignite, in, mass, or, bulk, magnesium, metal, will, ignite, magnesium, may, also, be, used, as, an, igniter, for, thermite, a, mixture, of, aluminium, and, iron, oxide, powder, that, ignites, only, at, a, very, high, temperature, organomagnesium, compounds, are, widespread, in, organic, chemistry, they, are, commonly, found, as, grignard, reagents, formed, by, reaction, of, magnesium, with, haloalkanes, examples, of, grignard, reagents, are, phenylmagnesium, bromide, and, ethylmagnesium, bromide, the, grignard, reagents, function, as, a, common, nucleophile, attacking, the, electrophilic, group, such, as, the, carbon, atom, that, is, present, within, the, polar, bond, of, a, carbonyl, group, a, prominent, organomagnesium, reagent, beyond, grignard, reagents, is, magnesium, anthracene, which, is, used, as, a, source, of, highly, active, magnesium, the, related, butadiene, magnesium, adduct, serves, as, a, source, for, the, butadiene, dianion, complexes, of, dimagnesium, i, have, been, observed, the, presence, of, magnesium, ions, can, be, detected, by, the, addition, of, ammonium, chloride, ammonium, hydroxide, and, monosodium, phosphate, to, an, aqueous, or, dilute, hcl, solution, of, the, salt, the, formation, of, a, white, precipitate, indicates, the, presence, of, magnesium, ions, azo, violet, dye, can, also, be, used, turning, deep, blue, in, the, presence, of, an, alkaline, solution, of, magnesium, salt, the, color, is, due, to, the, adsorption, of, azo, violet, by, mg, oh, 2, as, of, 2013, magnesium, alloys, consumption, was, less, than, one, million, tonnes, per, year, compared, with, 50, million, tonnes, of, aluminium, alloys, their, use, has, been, historically, limited, by, the, tendency, of, mg, alloys, to, corrode, creep, at, high, temperatures, and, combust, in, magnesium, alloys, the, presence, of, iron, nickel, copper, or, cobalt, strongly, activates, corrosion, in, more, than, trace, amounts, these, metals, precipitate, as, intermetallic, compounds, and, the, precipitate, locales, function, as, active, cathodic, sites, that, reduce, water, causing, the, loss, of, magnesium, controlling, the, quantity, of, these, metals, improves, corrosion, resistance, sufficient, manganese, overcomes, the, corrosive, effects, of, iron, this, requires, precise, control, over, composition, increasing, costs, adding, a, cathodic, poison, captures, atomic, hydrogen, within, the, structure, of, a, metal, this, prevents, the, formation, of, free, hydrogen, gas, an, essential, factor, of, corrosive, chemical, processes, the, addition, of, about, one, in, three, hundred, parts, arsenic, reduces, the, corrosion, rate, of, magnesium, in, a, salt, solution, by, a, factor, of, nearly, ten, magnesium, s, tendency, to, creep, gradually, deform, at, high, temperatures, is, greatly, reduced, by, alloying, with, zinc, and, rare, earth, elements, flammability, is, significantly, reduced, by, a, small, amount, of, calcium, in, the, alloy, by, using, rare, earth, elements, it, may, be, possible, to, manufacture, magnesium, alloys, that, are, able, to, not, catch, fire, at, higher, temperatures, compared, to, magnesium, s, liquidus, and, in, some, cases, potentially, pushing, it, close, to, magnesium, s, boiling, point, magnesium, forms, a, variety, of, compounds, important, to, industry, and, biology, including, magnesium, carbonate, magnesium, chloride, magnesium, citrate, magnesium, hydroxide, milk, of, magnesia, magnesium, oxide, magnesium, sulfate, and, magnesium, sulfate, heptahydrate, epsom, salts, as, recently, as, 2020, magnesium, hydride, was, under, investigation, as, a, way, to, store, hydrogen, magnesium, has, three, stable, isotopes, 24, mg, 25, mg, and, 26, mg, all, are, present, in, significant, amounts, in, nature, see, table, of, isotopes, above, about, 79, of, mg, is, 24, mg, the, isotope, 28, mg, is, radioactive, and, in, the, 1950s, to, 1970s, was, produced, by, several, nuclear, power, plants, for, use, in, scientific, experiments, this, isotope, has, a, relatively, short, half, life, 21, hours, and, its, use, was, limited, by, shipping, times, the, nuclide, 26, mg, has, found, application, in, isotopic, geology, similar, to, that, of, aluminium, 26, mg, is, a, radiogenic, daughter, product, of, 26, al, which, has, a, half, life, of, 717, 000, years, excessive, quantities, of, stable, 26, mg, have, been, observed, in, the, ca, al, rich, inclusions, of, some, carbonaceous, chondrite, meteorites, this, anomalous, abundance, is, attributed, to, the, decay, of, its, parent, 26, al, in, the, inclusions, and, researchers, conclude, that, such, meteorites, were, formed, in, the, solar, nebula, before, the, 26, al, had, decayed, these, are, among, the, oldest, objects, in, the, solar, system, and, contain, preserved, information, about, its, early, history, it, is, conventional, to, plot, 26, mg, 24, mg, against, an, al, mg, ratio, in, an, isochron, dating, plot, the, al, mg, ratio, plotted, is, 27, al, 24, mg, the, slope, of, the, isochron, has, no, age, significance, but, indicates, the, initial, 26, al, 27, al, ratio, in, the, sample, at, the, time, when, the, systems, were, separated, from, a, common, reservoir, magnesium, is, the, eighth, most, abundant, element, in, the, earth, s, crust, by, mass, and, tied, in, seventh, place, with, iron, in, molarity, it, is, found, in, large, deposits, of, magnesite, dolomite, and, other, minerals, and, in, mineral, waters, where, magnesium, ion, is, soluble, although, magnesium, is, found, in, more, than, 60, minerals, only, dolomite, magnesite, brucite, carnallite, talc, and, olivine, are, of, commercial, importance, the, mg, 2, cation, is, the, second, most, abundant, cation, in, seawater, about, 1, 8, the, mass, of, sodium, ions, in, a, given, sample, which, makes, seawater, and, sea, salt, attractive, commercial, sources, for, mg, to, extract, the, magnesium, calcium, hydroxide, is, added, to, the, seawater, to, precipitate, magnesium, hydroxide, magnesium, hydroxide, brucite, is, poorly, soluble, in, water, and, can, be, collected, by, filtration, it, reacts, with, hydrochloric, acid, to, magnesium, chloride, from, magnesium, chloride, electrolysis, produces, magnesium, world, production, was, approximately, 1, 100, kt, in, 2017, with, the, bulk, being, produced, in, china, 930, kt, and, russia, 60, kt, the, united, states, was, in, the, 20th, century, the, major, world, supplier, of, this, metal, supplying, 45, of, world, production, even, as, recently, as, 1995, since, the, chinese, mastery, of, the, pidgeon, process, the, us, market, share, is, at, 7, with, a, single, us, producer, left, as, of, 2013, us, magnesium, a, renco, group, company, located, on, the, shores, of, the, great, salt, lake, in, september, 2021, china, took, steps, to, reduce, production, of, magnesium, as, a, result, of, a, government, initiative, to, reduce, energy, availability, for, manufacturing, industries, leading, to, a, significant, price, increase, the, pidgeon, process, and, the, bolzano, process, are, similar, in, both, magnesium, oxide, is, the, precursor, to, magnesium, metal, the, magnesium, oxide, is, produced, as, a, solid, solution, with, calcium, oxide, by, calcining, the, mineral, dolomite, which, is, a, solid, solution, of, calcium, and, magnesium, carbonates, reduction, occurs, at, high, temperatures, with, silicon, a, ferrosilicon, alloy, is, used, rather, than, pure, silicon, as, it, is, more, economical, the, iron, component, has, no, bearing, on, the, reaction, having, the, simplified, equation, the, calcium, oxide, combines, with, silicon, as, the, oxygen, scavenger, yielding, the, very, stable, calcium, silicate, the, mg, ca, ratio, of, the, precursors, can, be, adjusted, by, the, addition, of, mgo, or, cao, the, pidgeon, and, the, bolzano, process, differ, in, the, details, of, the, heating, and, the, configuration, of, the, reactor, both, generate, gaseous, mg, that, is, condensed, and, collected, the, pidgeon, process, dominates, the, worldwide, production, the, pidgeon, method, is, less, technologically, complex, and, because, of, distillation, vapour, deposition, conditions, a, high, purity, product, is, easily, achievable, china, is, almost, completely, reliant, on, the, silicothermic, pidgeon, process, besides, the, pigeon, process, the, second, most, used, process, for, magnesium, production, is, electrolysis, this, is, a, two, step, process, the, first, step, is, to, prepare, feedstock, containing, magnesium, chloride, and, the, second, step, is, to, dissociate, the, compound, in, electrolytic, cells, as, magnesium, metal, and, chlorine, gas, the, basic, reaction, is, as, follows, the, temperatures, at, which, this, reaction, is, operated, is, between, 680, and, 750, c, the, magnesium, chloride, can, be, obtained, using, the, dow, process, a, process, that, mixes, sea, water, and, dolomite, in, a, flocculator, or, by, dehydration, of, magnesium, chloride, brines, the, electrolytic, cells, are, partially, submerged, in, a, molten, salt, electrolyte, to, which, the, produced, magnesium, chloride, is, added, in, concentrations, between, 6, 18, this, process, does, have, its, share, of, disadvantages, including, production, of, harmful, chlorine, gas, and, the, overall, reaction, being, very, energy, intensive, creating, environmental, risks, the, pidgeon, process, is, more, advantageous, regarding, its, simplicity, shorter, construction, period, low, power, consumption, and, overall, good, magnesium, quality, compared, to, the, electrolysis, method, in, the, united, states, magnesium, was, once, obtained, principally, with, the, dow, process, in, corpus, christi, tx, by, electrolysis, of, fused, magnesium, chloride, from, brine, and, sea, water, a, saline, solution, containing, mg, 2, ions, is, first, treated, with, lime, calcium, oxide, and, the, precipitated, magnesium, hydroxide, is, collected, the, hydroxide, is, then, converted, to, magnesium, chloride, by, treatment, with, hydrochloric, acid, and, heating, of, the, product, to, eliminate, water, the, salt, is, then, electrolyzed, in, the, molten, state, at, the, cathode, the, mg, 2, ion, is, reduced, by, two, electrons, to, magnesium, metal, at, the, anode, each, pair, of, cl, ions, is, oxidized, to, chlorine, gas, releasing, two, electrons, to, complete, the, circuit, the, carbothermic, route, to, magnesium, has, been, recognized, as, a, low, energy, yet, high, productivity, path, to, magnesium, extraction, the, chemistry, is, as, follows, c, mgo, co, mg, a, disadvantage, of, this, method, is, that, slow, cooling, the, vapour, can, cause, the, reaction, to, quickly, revert, to, prevent, this, from, happening, the, magnesium, can, be, dissolved, directly, in, a, suitable, metal, solvent, before, reversion, starts, happening, rapid, quenching, of, the, vapour, can, also, be, performed, to, prevent, reversion, a, newer, process, solid, oxide, membrane, technology, involves, the, electrolytic, reduction, of, mgo, at, the, cathode, mg, 2, ion, is, reduced, by, two, electrons, to, magnesium, metal, the, electrolyte, is, yttria, stabilized, zirconia, ysz, the, anode, is, a, liquid, metal, at, the, ysz, liquid, metal, anode, o, 2, is, oxidized, a, layer, of, graphite, borders, the, liquid, metal, anode, and, at, this, interface, carbon, and, oxygen, react, to, form, carbon, monoxide, when, silver, is, used, as, the, liquid, metal, anode, there, is, no, reductant, carbon, or, hydrogen, needed, and, only, oxygen, gas, is, evolved, at, the, anode, it, was, reported, in, 2011, that, this, method, provides, a, 40, reduction, in, cost, per, pound, over, the, electrolytic, reduction, method, rieke, et, al, developed, a, general, approach, for, preparing, highly, reactive, metal, powders, by, reducing, metal, salts, in, ethereal, or, hydrocarbon, solvents, using, alkali, metals, as, reducing, agents, now, known, as, the, rieke, process, rieke, finalized, the, identification, of, rieke, metals, in, 1989, one, of, which, was, rieke, magnesium, first, produced, in, 1974, the, name, magnesium, originates, from, the, greek, word, for, locations, related, to, the, tribe, of, the, magnetes, either, a, district, in, thessaly, called, magnesia, or, magnesia, ad, sipylum, now, in, turkey, it, is, related, to, magnetite, and, manganese, which, also, originated, from, this, area, and, required, differentiation, as, separate, substances, see, manganese, for, this, history, in, 1618, a, farmer, at, epsom, in, england, attempted, to, give, his, cows, water, from, a, local, well, the, cows, refused, to, drink, because, of, the, water, s, bitter, taste, but, the, farmer, noticed, that, the, water, seemed, to, heal, scratches, and, rashes, the, substance, obtained, by, evaporating, the, water, became, known, as, epsom, salts, and, its, fame, spread, it, was, eventually, recognized, as, hydrated, magnesium, sulfate, mgso, 4, 7, h, 2, o, the, metal, itself, was, first, isolated, by, sir, humphry, davy, in, england, in, 1808, he, used, electrolysis, on, a, mixture, of, magnesia, and, mercuric, oxide, antoine, bussy, prepared, it, in, coherent, form, in, 1831, davy, s, first, suggestion, for, a, name, was, magnium, but, the, name, magnesium, is, now, used, in, most, european, languages, magnesium, is, the, third, most, commonly, used, structural, metal, following, iron, and, aluminium, the, main, applications, of, magnesium, are, in, order, aluminium, alloys, die, casting, alloyed, with, zinc, removing, sulfur, in, the, production, of, iron, and, steel, and, the, production, of, titanium, in, the, kroll, process, magnesium, is, used, in, lightweight, materials, and, alloys, for, example, when, infused, with, silicon, carbide, nanoparticles, it, has, extremely, high, specific, strength, historically, magnesium, was, one, of, the, main, aerospace, construction, metals, and, was, used, for, german, military, aircraft, as, early, as, world, war, i, and, extensively, for, german, aircraft, in, world, war, ii, the, germans, coined, the, name, elektron, for, magnesium, alloy, a, term, which, is, still, used, today, in, the, commercial, aerospace, industry, magnesium, was, generally, restricted, to, engine, related, components, due, to, fire, and, corrosion, hazards, magnesium, alloy, use, in, aerospace, is, increasing, in, the, 21st, century, driven, by, the, importance, of, fuel, economy, magnesium, alloys, can, act, as, replacements, for, aluminium, and, steel, alloys, in, structural, applications, both, aj62a, and, ae44, are, recent, developments, in, high, temperature, low, creep, magnesium, alloys, the, general, strategy, for, such, alloys, is, to, form, intermetallic, precipitates, at, the, grain, boundaries, for, example, by, adding, mischmetal, or, calcium, because, of, low, density, and, good, mechanical, and, electrical, properties, magnesium, is, used, for, manufacturing, of, mobile, phones, laptop, and, tablet, computers, cameras, and, other, electronic, components, it, was, used, as, a, premium, feature, because, of, its, light, weight, in, some, 2020, laptops, when, burning, in, air, magnesium, produces, a, brilliant, white, light, that, includes, strong, ultraviolet, wavelengths, magnesium, powder, flash, powder, was, used, for, subject, illumination, in, the, early, days, of, photography, later, magnesium, filament, was, used, in, electrically, ignited, single, use, photography, flashbulbs, magnesium, powder, is, used, in, fireworks, and, marine, flares, where, a, brilliant, white, light, is, required, it, was, also, used, for, various, theatrical, effects, such, as, lightning, pistol, flashes, and, supernatural, appearances, magnesium, is, flammable, burning, at, a, temperature, of, approximately, 3, 100, c, 3, 370, k, 5, 610, f, and, the, autoignition, temperature, of, magnesium, ribbon, is, approximately, 473, c, 746, k, 883, f, magnesium, s, high, combustion, temperature, makes, it, a, useful, tool, for, starting, emergency, fires, other, uses, include, flash, photography, flares, pyrotechnics, fireworks, sparklers, and, trick, birthday, candles, magnesium, is, also, often, used, to, ignite, thermite, or, other, materials, that, require, a, high, ignition, temperature, magnesium, continues, to, be, used, as, an, incendiary, element, in, warfare, flame, temperatures, of, magnesium, and, magnesium, alloys, can, reach, 3, 100, c, 5, 610, f, although, flame, height, above, the, burning, metal, is, usually, less, than, 300, mm, 12, in, once, ignited, such, fires, are, difficult, to, extinguish, because, they, resist, several, substances, commonly, used, to, put, out, fires, combustion, continues, in, nitrogen, forming, magnesium, nitride, in, carbon, dioxide, forming, magnesium, oxide, and, carbon, and, in, water, forming, magnesium, oxide, and, hydrogen, which, also, combusts, due, to, heat, in, the, presence, of, additional, oxygen, this, property, was, used, in, incendiary, weapons, during, the, firebombing, of, cities, in, world, war, ii, where, the, only, practical, civil, defense, was, to, smother, a, burning, flare, under, dry, sand, to, exclude, atmosphere, from, the, combustion, in, the, form, of, turnings, or,
