a, supermassive, black, hole, smbh, or, sometimes, sbh, is, the, largest, type, of, black, hole, with, its, mass, being, on, the, order, of, hundreds, of, thousands, or, millions, to, billions, of, times, the, mass, of, the, sun, m, black, holes, are, a, class, of, astronomical, objects, that, have, undergone, gravitational, collapse, leaving, behind, spheroidal, regions, of, space, from, which, nothing, can, escape, including, light, observational, evidence, indicates, that, almost, every, large, galaxy, has, a, supermassive, black, hole, at, its, center, for, example, the, milky, way, galaxy, has, a, supermassive, black, hole, at, its, center, corresponding, to, the, radio, source, sagittarius, a, accretion, of, interstellar, gas, onto, supermassive, black, holes, is, the, process, responsible, for, powering, active, galactic, nuclei, agns, and, quasars, two, supermassive, black, holes, have, been, directly, imaged, by, the, event, horizon, telescope, the, black, hole, in, the, giant, elliptical, galaxy, messier, 87, and, the, black, hole, at, the, milky, way, s, center, sagittarius, a, supermassive, black, holes, are, classically, defined, as, black, holes, with, a, mass, above, 100, 000, 10, 5, solar, masses, m, some, have, masses, of, several, billion, m, supermassive, black, holes, have, physical, properties, that, clearly, distinguish, them, from, lower, mass, classifications, first, the, tidal, forces, in, the, vicinity, of, the, event, horizon, are, significantly, weaker, for, supermassive, black, holes, the, tidal, force, on, a, body, at, a, black, hole, s, event, horizon, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, black, hole, s, mass, a, person, at, the, event, horizon, of, a, 10, million, m, black, hole, experiences, about, the, same, tidal, force, between, their, head, and, feet, as, a, person, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, unlike, with, stellar, mass, black, holes, one, would, not, experience, significant, tidal, force, until, very, deep, into, the, black, hole, s, event, horizon, it, is, somewhat, counterintuitive, to, note, that, the, average, density, of, a, smbh, within, its, event, horizon, defined, as, the, mass, of, the, black, hole, divided, by, the, volume, of, space, within, its, schwarzschild, radius, can, be, smaller, than, the, density, of, water, this, is, because, the, schwarzschild, radius, r, s, displaystyle, r, text, s, is, directly, proportional, to, its, mass, since, the, volume, of, a, spherical, object, such, as, the, event, horizon, of, a, non, rotating, black, hole, is, directly, proportional, to, the, cube, of, the, radius, the, density, of, a, black, hole, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, mass, and, thus, higher, mass, black, holes, have, a, lower, average, density, the, schwarzschild, radius, of, the, event, horizon, of, a, nonrotating, and, uncharged, supermassive, black, hole, of, around, 1, billion, m, is, comparable, to, the, semi, major, axis, of, the, orbit, of, planet, uranus, which, is, about, 19, au, some, astronomers, refer, to, black, holes, of, greater, than, 5, billion, m, as, ultramassive, black, holes, umbhs, or, ubhs, but, the, term, is, not, broadly, used, possible, examples, include, the, black, holes, at, the, cores, of, ton, 618, ngc, 6166, eso, 444, 46, and, ngc, 4889, which, are, among, the, most, massive, black, holes, known, some, studies, have, suggested, that, the, maximum, natural, mass, that, a, black, hole, can, reach, while, being, luminous, accretors, featuring, an, accretion, disk, is, typically, on, the, order, of, about, 50, billion, m, however, a, 2020, study, suggested, even, larger, black, holes, dubbed, stupendously, large, black, holes, slabs, with, masses, greater, than, 100, billion, m, could, exist, based, on, used, models, some, studies, place, the, black, hole, at, the, core, of, phoenix, a, in, this, category, the, story, of, how, supermassive, black, holes, were, found, began, with, the, investigation, by, maarten, schmidt, of, the, radio, source, 3c, 273, in, 1963, initially, this, was, thought, to, be, a, star, but, the, spectrum, proved, puzzling, it, was, determined, to, be, hydrogen, emission, lines, that, had, been, redshifted, indicating, the, object, was, moving, away, from, the, earth, hubble, s, law, showed, that, the, object, was, located, several, billion, light, years, away, and, thus, must, be, emitting, the, energy, equivalent, of, hundreds, of, galaxies, the, rate, of, light, variations, of, the, source, dubbed, a, quasi, stellar, object, or, quasar, suggested, the, emitting, region, had, a, diameter, of, one, parsec, or, less, four, such, sources, had, been, identified, by, 1964, in, 1963, fred, hoyle, and, w, a, fowler, proposed, the, existence, of, hydrogen, burning, supermassive, stars, sms, as, an, explanation, for, the, compact, dimensions, and, high, energy, output, of, quasars, these, would, have, a, mass, of, about, 10, 5, 10, 9, m, however, richard, feynman, noted, stars, above, a, certain, critical, mass, are, dynamically, unstable, and, would, collapse, into, a, black, hole, at, least, if, they, were, non, rotating, fowler, then, proposed, that, these, supermassive, stars, would, undergo, a, series, of, collapse, and, explosion, oscillations, thereby, explaining, the, energy, output, pattern, appenzeller, and, fricke, 1972, built, models, of, this, behavior, but, found, that, the, resulting, star, would, still, undergo, collapse, concluding, that, a, non, rotating, 0, 75, 10, 6, m, sms, cannot, escape, collapse, to, a, black, hole, by, burning, its, hydrogen, through, the, cno, cycle, edwin, e, salpeter, and, yakov, zeldovich, made, the, proposal, in, 1964, that, matter, falling, onto, a, massive, compact, object, would, explain, the, properties, of, quasars, it, would, require, a, mass, of, around, 10, 8, m, to, match, the, output, of, these, objects, donald, lynden, bell, noted, in, 1969, that, the, infalling, gas, would, form, a, flat, disk, that, spirals, into, the, central, schwarzschild, throat, he, noted, that, the, relatively, low, output, of, nearby, galactic, cores, implied, these, were, old, inactive, quasars, meanwhile, in, 1967, martin, ryle, and, malcolm, longair, suggested, that, nearly, all, sources, of, extra, galactic, radio, emission, could, be, explained, by, a, model, in, which, particles, are, ejected, from, galaxies, at, relativistic, velocities, meaning, they, are, moving, near, the, speed, of, light, martin, ryle, malcolm, longair, and, peter, scheuer, then, proposed, in, 1973, that, the, compact, central, nucleus, could, be, the, original, energy, source, for, these, relativistic, jets, arthur, m, wolfe, and, geoffrey, burbidge, noted, in, 1970, that, the, large, velocity, dispersion, of, the, stars, in, the, nuclear, region, of, elliptical, galaxies, could, only, be, explained, by, a, large, mass, concentration, at, the, nucleus, larger, than, could, be, explained, by, ordinary, stars, they, showed, that, the, behavior, could, be, explained, by, a, massive, black, hole, with, up, to, 10, 10, m, or, a, large, number, of, smaller, black, holes, with, masses, below, 10, 3, m, dynamical, evidence, for, a, massive, dark, object, was, found, at, the, core, of, the, active, elliptical, galaxy, messier, 87, in, 1978, initially, estimated, at, 5, 10, 9, m, discovery, of, similar, behavior, in, other, galaxies, soon, followed, including, the, andromeda, galaxy, in, 1984, and, the, sombrero, galaxy, in, 1988, donald, lynden, bell, and, martin, rees, hypothesized, in, 1971, that, the, center, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, would, contain, a, massive, black, hole, sagittarius, a, was, discovered, and, named, on, february, 13, and, 15, 1974, by, astronomers, bruce, balick, and, robert, brown, using, the, green, bank, interferometer, of, the, national, radio, astronomy, observatory, they, discovered, a, radio, source, that, emits, synchrotron, radiation, it, was, found, to, be, dense, and, immobile, because, of, its, gravitation, this, was, therefore, the, first, indication, that, a, supermassive, black, hole, exists, in, the, center, of, the, milky, way, the, hubble, space, telescope, launched, in, 1990, provided, the, resolution, needed, to, perform, more, refined, observations, of, galactic, nuclei, in, 1994, the, faint, object, spectrograph, on, the, hubble, was, used, to, observe, messier, 87, finding, that, ionized, gas, was, orbiting, the, central, part, of, the, nucleus, at, a, velocity, of, 500, km, s, the, data, indicated, a, concentrated, mass, of, 2, 4, 0, 7, 10, 9, m, lay, within, a, 0, 25, span, providing, strong, evidence, of, a, supermassive, black, hole, using, the, very, long, baseline, array, to, observe, messier, 106, miyoshi, et, al, 1995, were, able, to, demonstrate, that, the, emission, from, an, h, 2, o, maser, in, this, galaxy, came, from, a, gaseous, disk, in, the, nucleus, that, orbited, a, concentrated, mass, of, 3, 6, 10, 7, m, which, was, constrained, to, a, radius, of, 0, 13, parsecs, their, ground, breaking, research, noted, that, a, swarm, of, solar, mass, black, holes, within, a, radius, this, small, would, not, survive, for, long, without, undergoing, collisions, making, a, supermassive, black, hole, the, sole, viable, candidate, accompanying, this, observation, which, provided, the, first, confirmation, of, supermassive, black, holes, was, the, discovery, of, the, highly, broadened, ionised, iron, k, emission, line, 6, 4, kev, from, the, galaxy, mcg, 6, 30, 15, the, broadening, was, due, to, the, gravitational, redshift, of, the, light, as, it, escaped, from, just, 3, to, 10, schwarzschild, radii, from, the, black, hole, on, april, 10, 2019, the, event, horizon, telescope, collaboration, released, the, first, horizon, scale, image, of, a, black, hole, in, the, center, of, the, galaxy, messier, 87, in, march, 2020, astronomers, suggested, that, additional, subrings, should, form, the, photon, ring, proposing, a, way, of, better, detecting, these, signatures, in, the, first, black, hole, image, the, origin, of, supermassive, black, holes, remains, an, active, field, of, research, astrophysicists, agree, that, black, holes, can, grow, by, accretion, of, matter, and, by, merging, with, other, black, holes, there, are, several, hypotheses, for, the, formation, mechanisms, and, initial, masses, of, the, progenitors, or, seeds, of, supermassive, black, holes, independently, of, the, specific, formation, channel, for, the, black, hole, seed, given, sufficient, mass, nearby, it, could, accrete, to, become, an, intermediate, mass, black, hole, and, possibly, a, smbh, if, the, accretion, rate, persists, distant, and, early, supermassive, black, holes, such, as, j0313, 1806, and, ulas, j1342, 0928, are, hard, to, explain, so, soon, after, the, big, bang, some, postulate, they, might, come, from, direct, collapse, of, dark, matter, with, self, interaction, a, small, minority, of, sources, argue, that, they, may, be, evidence, that, the, universe, is, the, result, of, a, big, bounce, instead, of, a, big, bang, with, these, supermassive, black, holes, being, formed, before, the, big, bounce, the, early, progenitor, seeds, may, be, black, holes, of, tens, or, perhaps, hundreds, of, m, that, are, left, behind, by, the, explosions, of, massive, stars, and, grow, by, accretion, of, matter, another, model, involves, a, dense, stellar, cluster, undergoing, core, collapse, as, the, negative, heat, capacity, of, the, system, drives, the, velocity, dispersion, in, the, core, to, relativistic, speeds, before, the, first, stars, large, gas, clouds, could, collapse, into, a, quasi, star, which, would, in, turn, collapse, into, a, black, hole, of, around, 20, m, these, stars, may, have, also, been, formed, by, dark, matter, halos, drawing, in, enormous, amounts, of, gas, by, gravity, which, would, then, produce, supermassive, stars, with, tens, of, thousands, of, m, the, quasi, star, becomes, unstable, to, radial, perturbations, because, of, electron, positron, pair, production, in, its, core, and, could, collapse, directly, into, a, black, hole, without, a, supernova, explosion, which, would, eject, most, of, its, mass, preventing, the, black, hole, from, growing, as, fast, a, more, recent, theory, proposes, that, smbh, seeds, were, formed, in, the, very, early, universe, each, from, the, collapse, of, a, supermassive, star, with, mass, of, around, 100, 000, m, large, high, redshift, clouds, of, metal, free, gas, when, irradiated, by, a, sufficiently, intense, flux, of, lyman, werner, photons, can, avoid, cooling, and, fragmenting, thus, collapsing, as, a, single, object, due, to, self, gravitation, the, core, of, the, collapsing, object, reaches, extremely, large, values, of, matter, density, of, the, order, of, about, 10, 7, g, cm, 3, and, triggers, a, general, relativistic, instability, thus, the, object, collapses, directly, into, a, black, hole, without, passing, from, the, intermediate, phase, of, a, star, or, of, a, quasi, star, these, objects, have, a, typical, mass, of, about, 100, 000, m, and, are, named, direct, collapse, black, holes, a, 2022, computer, simulation, showed, that, the, first, supermassive, black, holes, can, arise, in, rare, turbulent, clumps, of, gas, called, primordial, halos, that, were, fed, by, unusually, strong, streams, of, cold, gas, the, key, simulation, result, was, that, cold, flows, suppressed, star, formation, in, the, turbulent, halo, until, the, halo, s, gravity, was, finally, able, to, overcome, the, turbulence, and, formed, two, direct, collapse, black, holes, of, 31, 000, m, and, 40, 000, m, the, birth, of, the, first, smbhs, can, therefore, be, a, result, of, standard, cosmological, structure, formation, contrary, to, what, had, been, thought, for, almost, two, decades, primordial, black, holes, pbhs, could, have, been, produced, directly, from, external, pressure, in, the, first, moments, after, the, big, bang, these, black, holes, would, then, have, more, time, than, any, of, the, above, models, to, accrete, allowing, them, sufficient, time, to, reach, supermassive, sizes, formation, of, black, holes, from, the, deaths, of, the, first, stars, has, been, extensively, studied, and, corroborated, by, observations, the, other, models, for, black, hole, formation, listed, above, are, theoretical, the, formation, of, a, supermassive, black, hole, requires, a, relatively, small, volume, of, highly, dense, matter, having, small, angular, momentum, normally, the, process, of, accretion, involves, transporting, a, large, initial, endowment, of, angular, momentum, outwards, and, this, appears, to, be, the, limiting, factor, in, black, hole, growth, this, is, a, major, component, of, the, theory, of, accretion, disks, gas, accretion, is, both, the, most, efficient, and, the, most, conspicuous, way, in, which, black, holes, grow, the, majority, of, the, mass, growth, of, supermassive, black, holes, is, thought, to, occur, through, episodes, of, rapid, gas, accretion, which, are, observable, as, active, galactic, nuclei, or, quasars, observations, reveal, that, quasars, were, much, more, frequent, when, the, universe, was, younger, indicating, that, supermassive, black, holes, formed, and, grew, early, a, major, constraining, factor, for, theories, of, supermassive, black, hole, formation, is, the, observation, of, distant, luminous, quasars, which, indicate, that, supermassive, black, holes, of, billions, of, m, had, already, formed, when, the, universe, was, less, than, one, billion, years, old, this, suggests, that, supermassive, black, holes, arose, very, early, in, the, universe, inside, the, first, massive, galaxies, there, is, a, natural, upper, limit, to, how, large, supermassive, black, holes, can, grow, supermassive, black, holes, in, any, quasar, or, active, galactic, nucleus, agn, appear, to, have, a, theoretical, upper, limit, of, physically, around, 50, billion, m, for, typical, parameters, as, anything, above, this, slows, growth, down, to, a, crawl, the, slowdown, tends, to, start, around, 10, billion, m, and, causes, the, unstable, accretion, disk, surrounding, the, black, hole, to, coalesce, into, stars, that, orbit, it, a, study, concluded, that, the, radius, of, the, innermost, stable, circular, orbit, isco, for, smbh, masses, above, this, limit, exceeds, the, self, gravity, radius, making, disc, formation, no, longer, possible, a, larger, upper, limit, of, around, 270, billion, m, was, represented, as, the, absolute, maximum, mass, limit, for, an, accreting, smbh, in, extreme, cases, for, example, its, maximal, prograde, spin, with, a, dimensionless, spin, parameter, of, a, 1, although, the, maximum, limit, for, a, black, hole, s, spin, parameter, is, very, slightly, lower, at, a, 0, 9982, at, masses, just, below, the, limit, the, disc, luminosity, of, a, field, galaxy, is, likely, to, be, below, the, eddington, limit, and, not, strong, enough, to, trigger, the, feedback, underlying, the, m, sigma, relation, so, smbhs, close, to, the, limit, can, evolve, above, this, it, was, noted, that, black, holes, close, to, this, limit, are, likely, to, be, rather, even, rarer, as, it, would, require, the, accretion, disc, to, be, almost, permanently, prograde, because, the, black, hole, grows, and, the, spin, down, effect, of, retrograde, accretion, is, larger, than, the, spin, up, by, prograde, accretion, due, to, its, isco, and, therefore, its, lever, arm, this, would, require, the, hole, spin, to, be, permanently, correlated, with, a, fixed, direction, of, the, potential, controlling, gas, flow, within, the, black, hole, s, host, galaxy, and, thus, would, tend, to, produce, a, spin, axis, and, hence, agn, jet, direction, which, is, similarly, aligned, with, the, galaxy, current, observations, do, not, support, this, correlation, the, so, called, chaotic, accretion, presumably, has, to, involve, multiple, small, scale, events, essentially, random, in, time, and, orientation, if, it, is, not, controlled, by, a, large, scale, potential, in, this, way, this, would, lead, the, accretion, statistically, to, spin, down, due, to, retrograde, events, having, larger, lever, arms, than, prograde, and, occurring, almost, as, often, there, is, also, other, interactions, with, large, smbhs, that, trend, to, reduce, their, spin, including, particularly, mergers, with, other, black, holes, which, can, statistically, decrease, the, spin, all, of, these, considerations, suggested, that, smbhs, usually, cross, the, critical, theoretical, mass, limit, at, modest, values, of, their, spin, parameters, so, that, 5, 10, 10, m, in, all, but, rare, cases, although, modern, umbhs, within, quasars, and, galactic, nuclei, cannot, grow, beyond, around, 5, 27, 10, 10, m, through, the, accretion, disk, and, as, well, given, the, current, age, of, the, universe, some, of, these, monster, black, holes, in, the, universe, are, predicted, to, still, continue, to, grow, up, to, stupendously, large, masses, of, perhaps, 10, 14, m, during, the, collapse, of, superclusters, of, galaxies, in, the, extremely, far, future, of, the, universe, gravitation, from, supermassive, black, holes, in, the, center, of, many, galaxies, is, thought, to, power, active, objects, such, as, seyfert, galaxies, and, quasars, and, the, relationship, between, the, mass, of, the, central, black, hole, and, the, mass, of, the, host, galaxy, depends, upon, the, galaxy, type, an, empirical, correlation, between, the, size, of, supermassive, black, holes, and, the, stellar, velocity, dispersion, displaystyle, sigma, of, a, galaxy, bulge, is, called, the, m, sigma, relation, an, agn, is, now, considered, to, be, a, galactic, core, hosting, a, massive, black, hole, that, is, accreting, matter, and, displays, a, sufficiently, strong, luminosity, the, nuclear, region, of, the, milky, way, for, example, lacks, sufficient, luminosity, to, satisfy, this, condition, the, unified, model, of, agn, is, the, concept, that, the, large, range, of, observed, properties, of, the, agn, taxonomy, can, be, explained, using, just, a, small, number, of, physical, parameters, for, the, initial, model, these, values, consisted, of, the, angle, of, the, accretion, disk, s, torus, to, the, line, of, sight, and, the, luminosity, of, the, source, agn, can, be, divided, into, two, main, groups, a, radiative, mode, agn, in, which, most, of, the, output, is, in, the, form, of, electromagnetic, radiation, through, an, optically, thick, accretion, disk, and, a, jet, mode, in, which, relativistic, jets, emerge, perpendicular, to, the, disk, the, interaction, of, a, pair, of, smbh, hosting, galaxies, can, lead, to, merger, events, dynamic, friction, on, the, hosted, smbh, objects, causes, them, to, sink, toward, the, center, of, the, merged, mass, eventually, forming, a, pair, with, a, separation, of, under, a, kiloparsec, the, interaction, of, this, pair, with, surrounding, stars, and, gas, will, then, gradually, bring, the, smbh, together, as, a, gravitationally, bound, binary, system, with, a, separation, of, ten, parsecs, or, less, once, the, pair, draw, as, close, as, 0, 001, parsecs, gravitational, radiation, will, cause, them, to, merge, by, the, time, this, happens, the, resulting, galaxy, will, have, long, since, relaxed, from, the, merger, event, with, the, initial, starburst, activity, and, agn, having, faded, away, the, gravitational, waves, from, this, coalescence, can, give, the, resulting, smbh, a, velocity, boost, of, up, to, several, thousand, km, s, propelling, it, away, from, the, galactic, center, and, possibly, even, ejecting, it, from, the, galaxy, this, phenomenon, is, called, a, gravitational, recoil, the, other, possible, way, to, eject, a, black, hole, is, the, classical, slingshot, scenario, also, called, slingshot, recoil, in, this, scenario, first, a, long, lived, binary, black, hole, forms, through, a, merger, of, two, galaxies, a, third, smbh, is, introduced, in, a, second, merger, and, sinks, into, the, center, of, the, galaxy, due, to, the, three, body, interaction, one, of, the, smbhs, usually, the, lightest, is, ejected, due, to, conservation, of, linear, momentum, the, other, two, smbhs, are, propelled, in, the, opposite, direction, as, a, binary, all, smbhs, can, be, ejected, in, this, scenario, an, ejected, black, hole, is, called, a, runaway, black, hole, there, are, different, ways, to, detect, recoiling, black, holes, often, a, displacement, of, a, quasar, agn, from, the, center, of, a, galaxy, or, a, spectroscopic, binary, nature, of, a, quasar, agn, is, seen, as, evidence, for, a, recoiled, black, hole, candidate, recoiling, black, holes, include, ngc, 3718, sdss1133, 3c, 186, e1821, 643, and, sdssj0927, 2943, candidate, runaway, black, holes, are, he0450, 2958, cid, 42, and, objects, around, rcp, 28, runaway, super, massive, black, holes, may, trigger, star, formation, in, their, wakes, a, linear, feature, near, the, dwarf, galaxy, rcp, 28, was, interpreted, as, the, star, forming, wake, of, a, candidate, runaway, black, hole, hawking, radiation, is, black, body, radiation, that, is, predicted, to, be, released, by, black, holes, due, to, quantum, effects, near, the, event, horizon, this, radiation, reduces, the, mass, and, energy, of, black, holes, causing, them, to, shrink, and, ultimately, vanish, if, black, holes, evaporate, via, hawking, radiation, a, non, rotating, and, uncharged, stupendously, large, black, hole, with, a, mass, of, 1, 10, 11, m, will, evaporate, in, around, 2, 1, 10, 100, years, black, holes, formed, during, the, predicted, collapse, of, superclusters, of, galaxies, in, the, far, future, with, 1, 10, 14, m, would, evaporate, over, a, timescale, of, up, to, 2, 1, 10, 109, years, some, of, the, best, evidence, for, the, presence, of, black, holes, is, provided, by, the, doppler, effect, whereby, light, from, nearby, orbiting, matter, is, red, shifted, when, receding, and, blue, shifted, when, advancing, for, matter, very, close, to, a, black, hole, the, orbital, speed, must, be, comparable, with, the, speed, of, light, so, receding, matter, will, appear, very, faint, compared, with, advancing, matter, which, means, that, systems, with, intrinsically, symmetric, discs, and, rings, will, acquire, a, highly, asymmetric, visual, appearance, this, effect, has, been, allowed, for, in, modern, computer, generated, images, such, as, the, example, presented, here, based, on, a, plausible, model, for, the, supermassive, black, hole, in, sgr, a, at, the, center, of, the, milky, way, however, the, resolution, provided, by, presently, available, telescope, technology, is, still, insufficient, to, confirm, such, predictions, directly, what, already, has, been, observed, directly, in, many, systems, are, the, lower, non, relativistic, velocities, of, matter, orbiting, further, out, from, what, are, presumed, to, be, black, holes, direct, doppler, measures, of, water, masers, surrounding, the, nuclei, of, nearby, galaxies, have, revealed, a, very, fast, keplerian, motion, only, possible, with, a, high, concentration, of, matter, in, the, center, currently, the, only, known, objects, that, can, pack, enough, matter, in, such, a, small, space, are, black, holes, or, things, that, will, evolve, into, black, holes, within, astrophysically, short, timescales, for, active, galaxies, farther, away, the, width, of, broad, spectral, lines, can, be, used, to, probe, the, gas, orbiting, near, the, event, horizon, the, technique, of, reverberation, mapping, uses, variability, of, these, lines, to, measure, the, mass, and, perhaps, the, spin, of, the, black, hole, that, powers, active, galaxies, evidence, indicates, that, the, milky, way, galaxy, has, a, supermassive, black, hole, at, its, center, 26, 000, light, years, from, the, solar, system, in, a, region, called, sagittarius, a, because, infrared, observations, of, bright, flare, activity, near, sagittarius, a, show, orbital, motion, of, plasma, with, a, period, of, 45, 15, min, at, a, separation, of, six, to, ten, times, the, gravitational, radius, of, the, candidate, smbh, this, emission, is, consistent, with, a, circularized, orbit, of, a, polarized, hot, spot, on, an, accretion, disk, in, a, strong, magnetic, field, the, radiating, matter, is, orbiting, at, 30, of, the, speed, of, light, just, outside, the, innermost, stable, circular, orbit, on, january, 5, 2015, nasa, reported, observing, an, x, ray, flare, 400, times, brighter, than, usual, a, record, breaker, from, sagittarius, a, the, unusual, event, may, have, been, caused, by, the, breaking, apart, of, an, asteroid, falling, into, the, black, hole, or, by, the, entanglement, of, magnetic, field, lines, within, gas, flowing, into, sagittarius, a, according, to, astronomers, unambiguous, dynamical, evidence, for, supermassive, black, holes, exists, only, for, a, handful, of, galaxies, these, include, the, milky, way, the, local, group, galaxies, m31, and, m32, and, a, few, galaxies, beyond, the, local, group, such, as, ngc, 4395, in, these, galaxies, the, root, mean, square, or, rms, velocities, of, the, stars, or, gas, rises, proportionally, to, 1, r, near, the, center, indicating, a, central, point, mass, in, all, other, galaxies, observed, to, date, the, rms, velocities, are, flat, or, even, falling, toward, the, center, making, it, impossible, to, state, with, certainty, that, a, supermassive, black, hole, is, present, nevertheless, it, is, commonly, accepted, that, the, center, of, nearly, every, galaxy, contains, a, supermassive, black, hole, the, reason, for, this, assumption, is, the, m, sigma, relation, a, tight, low, scatter, relation, between, the, mass, of, the, hole, in, the, 10, or, so, galaxies, with, secure, detections, and, the, velocity, dispersion, of, the, stars, in, the, bulges, of, those, galaxies, this, correlation, although, based, on, just, a, handful, of, galaxies, suggests, to, many, astronomers, a, strong, connection, between, the, formation, of, the, black, hole, and, the, galaxy, itself, on, march, 28, 2011, a, supermassive, black, hole, was, seen, tearing, a, mid, size, star, apart, that, is, the, only, likely, explanation, of, the, observations, that, day, of, sudden, x, ray, radiation, and, the, follow, up, broad, band, observations, the, source, was, previously, an, inactive, galactic, nucleus, and, from, study, of, the, outburst, the, galactic, nucleus, is, estimated, to, be, a, smbh, with, mass, of, the, order, of, a, million, m, this, rare, event, is, assumed, to, be, a, relativistic, outflow, material, being, emitted, in, a, jet, at, a, significant, fraction, of, the, speed, of, light, from, a, star, tidally, disrupted, by, the, smbh, a, significant, fraction, of, a, solar, mass, of, material, is, expected, to, have, accreted, onto, the, smbh, subsequent, long, term, observation, will, allow, this, assumption, to, be, confirmed, if, the, emission, from, the, jet, decays, at, the, expected, rate, for, mass, accretion, onto, a, smbh, the, nearby, andromeda, galaxy, 2, 5, million, light, years, away, contains, a, 1, 4, 0, 65, 0, 45, 10, 8, 140, million, m, central, black, hole, significantly, larger, than, the, milky, way, s, the, largest, supermassive, black, hole, in, the, milky, way, s, vicinity, appears, to, be, that, of, messier, 87, i, e, m87, at, a, mass, of, 6, 5, 0, 7, 10, 9, c, 6, 5, billion, m, at, a, distance, of, 48, 92, million, light, years, the, supergiant, elliptical, galaxy, ngc, 4889, at, a, distance, of, 336, million, light, years, away, in, the, coma, berenices, constellation, contains, a, black, hole, measured, to, be, 2, 1, 3, 5, 1, 3, 10, 10, 21, billion, m, masses, of, black, holes, in, quasars, can, be, estimated, via, indirect, methods, that, are, subject, to, substantial, uncertainty, the, quasar, ton, 618, is, an, example, of, an, object, with, an, extremely, large, black, hole, estimated, at, 4, 07, 10, 10, 40, 7, billion, m, its, redshift, is, 2, 219, other, examples, of, quasars, with, large, estimated, black, hole, masses, are, the, hyperluminous, quasar, apm, 08279, 5255, with, an, estimated, mass, of, 1, 10, 10, 10, billion, m, and, the, quasar, smss, j215728, 21, 360215, 1, with, a, mass, of, 3, 4, 0, 6, 10, 10, 34, billion, m, or, nearly, 10, 000, times, the, mass, of, the, black, hole, at, the, milky, way, s, galactic, center, some, galaxies, such, as, the, galaxy, 4c, 37, 11, appear, to, have, two, supermassive, black, holes, at, their, centers, forming, a, binary, system, if, they, collided, the, event, would, create, strong, gravitational, waves, binary, supermassive, black, holes, are, believed, to, be, a, common, consequence, of, galactic, mergers, the, binary, pair, in, oj, 287, 3, 5, billion, light, years, away, contains, the, most, massive, black, hole, in, a, pair, with, a, mass, estimated, at, 18, 348, billion, m, in, 2011, a, super, massive, black, hole, was, discovered, in, the, dwarf, galaxy, henize, 2, 10, which, has, no, bulge, the, precise, implications, for, this, discovery, on, black, hole, formation, are, unknown, but, may, indicate, that, black, holes, formed, before, bulges, in, 2012, astronomers, reported, an, unusually, large, mass, of, approximately, 17, billion, m, for, the, black, hole, in, the, compact, lenticular, galaxy, ngc, 1277, which, lies, 220, million, light, years, away, in, the, constellation, perseus, the, putative, black, hole, has, approximately, 59, percent, of, the, mass, of, the, bulge, of, this, lenticular, galaxy, 14, percent, of, the, total, stellar, mass, of, the, galaxy, another, study, reached, a, very, different, conclusion, this, black, hole, is, not, particularly, overmassive, estimated, at, between, 2, and, 5, billion, m, with, 5, billion, m, being, the, most, likely, value, on, february, 28, 2013, astronomers, reported, on, the, use, of, the, nustar, satellite, to, accurately, measure, the, spin, of, a, supermassive, black, hole, for, the, first, time, in, ngc, 1365, reporting, that, the, event, horizon, was, spinning, at, almost, the, speed, of, light, in, september, 2014, data, from, different, x, ray, telescopes, have, shown, that, the, extremely, small, dense, ultracompact, dwarf, galaxy, m60, ucd1, hosts, a, 20, million, solar, mass, black, hole, at, its, center, accounting, for, more, than, 10, of, the, total, mass, of, the, galaxy, the, discovery, is, quite, surprising, since, the, black, hole, is, five, times, more, massive, than, the, milky, way, s, black, hole, despite, the, galaxy, being, less, than, five, thousandths, the, mass, of, the, milky, way, some, galaxies, lack, any, supermassive, black, holes, in, their, centers, although, most, galaxies, with, no, supermassive, black, holes, are, very, small, dwarf, galaxies, one, discovery, remains, mysterious, the, supergiant, elliptical, cd, galaxy, a2261, bcg, has, not, been, found, to, contain, an, active, supermassive, black, hole, of, at, least, 10, 10, m, despite, the, galaxy, being, one, of, the, largest, galaxies, known, over, six, times, the, size, and, one, thousand, times, the, mass, of, the, milky, way, despite, that, several, studies, gave, very, large, mass, values, for, a, possible, central, black, hole, inside, a2261, bgc, such, as, about, as, large, as, 6, 5, 10, 9, 4, 1, 10, 10, m, or, as, low, as, 6, 11, 10, 9, m, since, a, supermassive, black, hole, will, only, be, visible, while, it, is, accreting, a, supermassive, black, hole, can, be, nearly, invisible, except, in, its, effects, on, stellar, orbits, this, implies, that, either, a2261, bgc, has, a, central, black, hole, that, is, accreting, at, a, low, level, or, has, a, mass, rather, below, 10, 10, m, in, december, 2017, astronomers, reported, the, detection, of, the, most, distant, quasar, known, by, this, time, ulas, j1342, 0928, containing, the, most, distant, supermassive, black, hole, at, a, reported, redshift, of, z, 7, 54, surpassing, the, redshift, of, 7, for, the, previously, known, most, distant, quasar, ulas, j1120, 0641, in, february, 2020, astronomers, reported, the, discovery, of, the, ophiuchus, supercluster, eruption, the, most, energetic, event, in, the, universe, ever, detected, since, the, big, bang, it, occurred, in, the, ophiuchus, cluster, in, the, galaxy, neve, 1, caused, by, the, accretion, of, nearly, 270, million, m, of, material, by, its, central, supermassive, black, hole, the, eruption, lasted, for, about, 100, million, years, and, released, 5, 7, million, times, more, energy, than, the, most, powerful, gamma, ray, burst, known, the, eruption, released, shock, waves, and, jets, of, high, energy, particles, that, punched, the, intracluster, medium, creating, a, cavity, about, 1, 5, million, light, years, wide, ten, times, the, milky, way, s, diameter, in, february, 2021, astronomers, released, for, the, first, time, a, very, high, resolution, image, of, 25, 000, active, supermassive, black, holes, covering, four, percent, of, the, northern, celestial, hemisphere, based, on, ultra, low, radio, wavelengths, as, detected, by, the, low, frequency, array, lofar, in, europe
