in, physics, electromagnetic, radiation, emr, consists, of, waves, of, the, electromagnetic, em, field, which, propagate, through, space, and, carry, momentum, and, electromagnetic, radiant, energy, classically, electromagnetic, radiation, consists, of, electromagnetic, waves, which, are, synchronized, oscillations, of, electric, and, magnetic, fields, in, a, vacuum, electromagnetic, waves, travel, at, the, speed, of, light, commonly, denoted, c, there, depending, on, the, frequency, of, oscillation, different, wavelengths, of, electromagnetic, spectrum, are, produced, in, homogeneous, isotropic, media, the, oscillations, of, the, two, fields, are, on, average, perpendicular, to, each, other, and, perpendicular, to, the, direction, of, energy, and, wave, propagation, forming, a, transverse, wave, the, position, of, an, electromagnetic, wave, within, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, can, be, characterized, by, either, its, frequency, of, oscillation, or, its, wavelength, electromagnetic, waves, of, different, frequency, are, called, by, different, names, since, they, have, different, sources, and, effects, on, matter, in, order, of, increasing, frequency, and, decreasing, wavelength, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, includes, radio, waves, microwaves, infrared, visible, light, ultraviolet, x, rays, and, gamma, rays, electromagnetic, waves, are, emitted, by, electrically, charged, particles, undergoing, acceleration, and, these, waves, can, subsequently, interact, with, other, charged, particles, exerting, force, on, them, em, waves, carry, energy, momentum, and, angular, momentum, away, from, their, source, particle, and, can, impart, those, quantities, to, matter, with, which, they, interact, electromagnetic, radiation, is, associated, with, those, em, waves, that, are, free, to, propagate, themselves, radiate, without, the, continuing, influence, of, the, moving, charges, that, produced, them, because, they, have, achieved, sufficient, distance, from, those, charges, thus, emr, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, far, field, while, the, near, field, refers, to, em, fields, near, the, charges, and, current, that, directly, produced, them, specifically, electromagnetic, induction, and, electrostatic, induction, phenomena, in, quantum, mechanics, an, alternate, way, of, viewing, emr, is, that, it, consists, of, photons, uncharged, elementary, particles, with, zero, rest, mass, which, are, the, quanta, of, the, electromagnetic, field, responsible, for, all, electromagnetic, interactions, quantum, electrodynamics, is, the, theory, of, how, emr, interacts, with, matter, on, an, atomic, level, quantum, effects, provide, additional, sources, of, emr, such, as, the, transition, of, electrons, to, lower, energy, levels, in, an, atom, and, black, body, radiation, the, energy, of, an, individual, photon, is, quantized, and, proportional, to, frequency, according, to, planck, s, equation, e, hf, where, e, is, the, energy, per, photon, f, is, the, frequency, of, the, photon, and, h, is, the, planck, constant, thus, higher, frequency, photons, have, more, energy, for, example, a, 10, 20, hz, gamma, ray, photon, has, 10, 19, times, the, energy, of, a, 10, 1, hz, extremely, low, frequency, radio, wave, photon, the, effects, of, emr, upon, chemical, compounds, and, biological, organisms, depend, both, upon, the, radiation, s, power, and, its, frequency, emr, of, lower, energy, ultraviolet, or, lower, frequencies, i, e, near, ultraviolet, visible, light, infrared, microwaves, and, radio, waves, is, non, ionizing, because, its, photons, do, not, individually, have, enough, energy, to, ionize, atoms, or, molecules, or, to, break, chemical, bonds, the, effect, of, non, ionizing, radiation, on, chemical, systems, and, living, tissue, is, primarily, simply, heating, through, the, combined, energy, transfer, of, many, photons, in, contrast, high, frequency, ultraviolet, x, rays, and, gamma, rays, are, ionizing, individual, photons, of, such, high, frequency, have, enough, energy, to, ionize, molecules, or, break, chemical, bonds, ionizing, radiation, can, cause, chemical, reactions, and, damage, living, cells, beyond, simply, heating, and, can, be, a, health, hazard, and, dangerous, james, clerk, maxwell, derived, a, wave, form, of, the, electric, and, magnetic, equations, thus, uncovering, the, wave, like, nature, of, electric, and, magnetic, fields, and, their, symmetry, because, the, speed, of, em, waves, predicted, by, the, wave, equation, coincided, with, the, measured, speed, of, light, maxwell, concluded, that, light, itself, is, an, em, wave, maxwell, s, equations, were, confirmed, by, heinrich, hertz, through, experiments, with, radio, waves, maxwell, s, equations, established, that, some, charges, and, currents, sources, produce, local, electromagnetic, fields, near, them, that, do, not, radiate, currents, directly, produce, magnetic, fields, but, such, fields, of, a, magnetic, dipole, type, that, dies, out, with, distance, from, the, current, in, a, similar, manner, moving, charges, pushed, apart, in, a, conductor, by, a, changing, electrical, potential, such, as, in, an, antenna, produce, an, electric, dipole, type, electrical, field, but, this, also, declines, with, distance, these, fields, make, up, the, near, field, neither, of, these, behaviours, is, responsible, for, em, radiation, instead, they, only, efficiently, transfer, energy, to, a, receiver, very, close, to, the, source, such, as, inside, a, transformer, the, near, field, has, strong, effects, its, source, with, any, energy, withdrawn, by, a, receiver, causing, increased, load, decreased, electrical, reactance, on, the, source, the, near, field, does, not, propagate, freely, into, space, carrying, energy, away, without, a, distance, limit, but, rather, oscillates, returning, its, energy, to, the, transmitter, if, it, is, not, absorbed, by, a, receiver, by, contrast, the, far, field, is, composed, of, radiation, that, is, free, of, the, transmitter, in, the, sense, that, the, transmitter, requires, the, same, power, to, send, changes, in, the, field, out, regardless, of, whether, anything, absorbs, the, signal, e, g, a, radio, station, does, not, need, to, increase, its, power, when, more, receivers, use, the, signal, this, far, part, of, the, electromagnetic, field, is, electromagnetic, radiation, the, far, fields, propagate, radiate, without, allowing, the, transmitter, to, affect, them, this, causes, them, to, be, independent, in, the, sense, that, their, existence, and, their, energy, after, they, have, left, the, transmitter, is, completely, independent, of, both, transmitter, and, receiver, due, to, conservation, of, energy, the, amount, of, power, passing, through, any, spherical, surface, drawn, around, the, source, is, the, same, because, such, a, surface, has, an, area, proportional, to, the, square, of, its, distance, from, the, source, the, power, density, of, em, radiation, from, an, isotropic, source, decreases, with, the, inverse, square, of, the, distance, from, the, source, this, is, called, the, inverse, square, law, this, is, in, contrast, to, dipole, parts, of, the, em, field, the, near, field, which, varies, in, intensity, according, to, an, inverse, cube, power, law, and, thus, does, not, transport, a, conserved, amount, of, energy, over, distances, but, instead, fades, with, distance, with, its, energy, as, noted, rapidly, returning, to, the, transmitter, or, absorbed, by, a, nearby, receiver, such, as, a, transformer, secondary, coil, in, the, li, nard, wiechert, potential, formulation, of, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, due, to, motion, of, a, single, particle, according, to, maxwell, s, equations, the, terms, associated, with, acceleration, of, the, particle, are, those, that, are, responsible, for, the, part, of, the, field, that, is, regarded, as, electromagnetic, radiation, by, contrast, the, term, associated, with, the, changing, static, electric, field, of, the, particle, and, the, magnetic, term, that, results, from, the, particle, s, uniform, velocity, are, both, associated, with, the, near, field, and, do, not, comprise, electromagnetic, radiation, electric, and, magnetic, fields, obey, the, properties, of, superposition, thus, a, field, due, to, any, particular, particle, or, time, varying, electric, or, magnetic, field, contributes, to, the, fields, present, in, the, same, space, due, to, other, causes, further, as, they, are, vector, fields, all, magnetic, and, electric, field, vectors, add, together, according, to, vector, addition, for, example, in, optics, two, or, more, coherent, light, waves, may, interact, and, by, constructive, or, destructive, interference, yield, a, resultant, irradiance, deviating, from, the, sum, of, the, component, irradiances, of, the, individual, light, waves, the, electromagnetic, fields, of, light, are, not, affected, by, traveling, through, static, electric, or, magnetic, fields, in, a, linear, medium, such, as, a, vacuum, however, in, nonlinear, media, such, as, some, crystals, interactions, can, occur, between, light, and, static, electric, and, magnetic, fields, these, interactions, include, the, faraday, effect, and, the, kerr, effect, in, refraction, a, wave, crossing, from, one, medium, to, another, of, different, density, alters, its, speed, and, direction, upon, entering, the, new, medium, the, ratio, of, the, refractive, indices, of, the, media, determines, the, degree, of, refraction, and, is, summarized, by, snell, s, law, light, of, composite, wavelengths, natural, sunlight, disperses, into, a, visible, spectrum, passing, through, a, prism, because, of, the, wavelength, dependent, refractive, index, of, the, prism, material, dispersion, that, is, each, component, wave, within, the, composite, light, is, bent, a, different, amount, em, radiation, exhibits, both, wave, properties, and, particle, properties, at, the, same, time, see, wave, particle, duality, both, wave, and, particle, characteristics, have, been, confirmed, in, many, experiments, wave, characteristics, are, more, apparent, when, em, radiation, is, measured, over, relatively, large, timescales, and, over, large, distances, while, particle, characteristics, are, more, evident, when, measuring, small, timescales, and, distances, for, example, when, electromagnetic, radiation, is, absorbed, by, matter, particle, like, properties, will, be, more, obvious, when, the, average, number, of, photons, in, the, cube, of, the, relevant, wavelength, is, much, smaller, than, 1, it, is, not, so, difficult, to, experimentally, observe, non, uniform, deposition, of, energy, when, light, is, absorbed, however, this, alone, is, not, evidence, of, particulate, behavior, rather, it, reflects, the, quantum, nature, of, matter, demonstrating, that, the, light, itself, is, quantized, not, merely, its, interaction, with, matter, is, a, more, subtle, affair, some, experiments, display, both, the, wave, and, particle, natures, of, electromagnetic, waves, such, as, the, self, interference, of, a, single, photon, when, a, single, photon, is, sent, through, an, interferometer, it, passes, through, both, paths, interfering, with, itself, as, waves, do, yet, is, detected, by, a, photomultiplier, or, other, sensitive, detector, only, once, a, quantum, theory, of, the, interaction, between, electromagnetic, radiation, and, matter, such, as, electrons, is, described, by, the, theory, of, quantum, electrodynamics, electromagnetic, waves, can, be, polarized, reflected, refracted, or, diffracted, and, can, interfere, with, each, other, in, homogeneous, isotropic, media, electromagnetic, radiation, is, a, transverse, wave, meaning, that, its, oscillations, are, perpendicular, to, the, direction, of, energy, transfer, and, travel, it, comes, from, the, following, equations, e, 0, b, 0, displaystyle, begin, aligned, nabla, cdot, mathbf, e, 0, nabla, cdot, mathbf, b, 0, end, aligned, these, equations, predicate, that, any, electromagnetic, wave, must, be, a, transverse, wave, where, the, electric, field, e, and, the, magnetic, field, b, are, both, perpendicular, to, the, direction, of, wave, propagation, the, electric, and, magnetic, parts, of, the, field, in, an, electromagnetic, wave, stand, in, a, fixed, ratio, of, strengths, to, satisfy, the, two, maxwell, equations, that, specify, how, one, is, produced, from, the, other, in, dissipation, less, lossless, media, these, e, and, b, fields, are, also, in, phase, with, both, reaching, maxima, and, minima, at, the, same, points, in, space, see, illustrations, in, the, far, field, em, radiation, which, is, described, by, the, two, source, free, maxwell, curl, operator, equations, a, time, change, in, one, type, of, field, is, proportional, to, the, curl, of, the, other, these, derivatives, require, that, the, e, and, b, fields, in, emr, are, in, phase, see, mathematics, section, below, an, important, aspect, of, light, s, nature, is, its, frequency, the, frequency, of, a, wave, is, its, rate, of, oscillation, and, is, measured, in, hertz, the, si, unit, of, frequency, where, one, hertz, is, equal, to, one, oscillation, per, second, light, usually, has, multiple, frequencies, that, sum, to, form, the, resultant, wave, different, frequencies, undergo, different, angles, of, refraction, a, phenomenon, known, as, dispersion, a, monochromatic, wave, a, wave, of, a, single, frequency, consists, of, successive, troughs, and, crests, and, the, distance, between, two, adjacent, crests, or, troughs, is, called, the, wavelength, waves, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, vary, in, size, from, very, long, radio, waves, longer, than, a, continent, to, very, short, gamma, rays, smaller, than, atom, nuclei, frequency, is, inversely, proportional, to, wavelength, according, to, the, equation, where, v, is, the, speed, of, the, wave, c, in, a, vacuum, or, less, in, other, media, f, is, the, frequency, and, is, the, wavelength, as, waves, cross, boundaries, between, different, media, their, speeds, change, but, their, frequencies, remain, constant, electromagnetic, waves, in, free, space, must, be, solutions, of, maxwell, s, electromagnetic, wave, equation, two, main, classes, of, solutions, are, known, namely, plane, waves, and, spherical, waves, the, plane, waves, may, be, viewed, as, the, limiting, case, of, spherical, waves, at, a, very, large, ideally, infinite, distance, from, the, source, both, types, of, waves, can, have, a, waveform, which, is, an, arbitrary, time, function, so, long, as, it, is, sufficiently, differentiable, to, conform, to, the, wave, equation, as, with, any, time, function, this, can, be, decomposed, by, means, of, fourier, analysis, into, its, frequency, spectrum, or, individual, sinusoidal, components, each, of, which, contains, a, single, frequency, amplitude, and, phase, such, a, component, wave, is, said, to, be, monochromatic, a, monochromatic, electromagnetic, wave, can, be, characterized, by, its, frequency, or, wavelength, its, peak, amplitude, its, phase, relative, to, some, reference, phase, its, direction, of, propagation, and, its, polarization, interference, is, the, superposition, of, two, or, more, waves, resulting, in, a, new, wave, pattern, if, the, fields, have, components, in, the, same, direction, they, constructively, interfere, while, opposite, directions, cause, destructive, interference, additionally, multiple, polarization, signals, can, be, combined, i, e, interfered, to, form, new, states, of, polarization, which, is, known, as, parallel, polarization, state, generation, the, energy, in, electromagnetic, waves, is, sometimes, called, radiant, energy, an, anomaly, arose, in, the, late, 19th, century, involving, a, contradiction, between, the, wave, theory, of, light, and, measurements, of, the, electromagnetic, spectra, that, were, being, emitted, by, thermal, radiators, known, as, black, bodies, physicists, struggled, with, this, problem, unsuccessfully, for, many, years, and, it, later, became, known, as, the, ultraviolet, catastrophe, in, 1900, max, planck, developed, a, new, theory, of, black, body, radiation, that, explained, the, observed, spectrum, planck, s, theory, was, based, on, the, idea, that, black, bodies, emit, light, and, other, electromagnetic, radiation, only, as, discrete, bundles, or, packets, of, energy, these, packets, were, called, quanta, in, 1905, albert, einstein, proposed, that, light, quanta, be, regarded, as, real, particles, later, the, particle, of, light, was, given, the, name, photon, to, correspond, with, other, particles, being, described, around, this, time, such, as, the, electron, and, proton, a, photon, has, an, energy, e, proportional, to, its, frequency, f, by, where, h, is, the, planck, constant, displaystyle, lambda, is, the, wavelength, and, c, is, the, speed, of, light, this, is, sometimes, known, as, the, planck, einstein, equation, in, quantum, theory, see, first, quantization, the, energy, of, the, photons, is, thus, directly, proportional, to, the, frequency, of, the, emr, wave, likewise, the, momentum, p, of, a, photon, is, also, proportional, to, its, frequency, and, inversely, proportional, to, its, wavelength, the, source, of, einstein, s, proposal, that, light, was, composed, of, particles, or, could, act, as, particles, in, some, circumstances, was, an, experimental, anomaly, not, explained, by, the, wave, theory, the, photoelectric, effect, in, which, light, striking, a, metal, surface, ejected, electrons, from, the, surface, causing, an, electric, current, to, flow, across, an, applied, voltage, experimental, measurements, demonstrated, that, the, energy, of, individual, ejected, electrons, was, proportional, to, the, frequency, rather, than, the, intensity, of, the, light, furthermore, below, a, certain, minimum, frequency, which, depended, on, the, particular, metal, no, current, would, flow, regardless, of, the, intensity, these, observations, appeared, to, contradict, the, wave, theory, and, for, years, physicists, tried, in, vain, to, find, an, explanation, in, 1905, einstein, explained, this, puzzle, by, resurrecting, the, particle, theory, of, light, to, explain, the, observed, effect, because, of, the, preponderance, of, evidence, in, favor, of, the, wave, theory, however, einstein, s, ideas, were, met, initially, with, great, skepticism, among, established, physicists, eventually, einstein, s, explanation, was, accepted, as, new, particle, like, behavior, of, light, was, observed, such, as, the, compton, effect, as, a, photon, is, absorbed, by, an, atom, it, excites, the, atom, elevating, an, electron, to, a, higher, energy, level, one, that, is, on, average, farther, from, the, nucleus, when, an, electron, in, an, excited, molecule, or, atom, descends, to, a, lower, energy, level, it, emits, a, photon, of, light, at, a, frequency, corresponding, to, the, energy, difference, since, the, energy, levels, of, electrons, in, atoms, are, discrete, each, element, and, each, molecule, emits, and, absorbs, its, own, characteristic, frequencies, immediate, photon, emission, is, called, fluorescence, a, type, of, photoluminescence, an, example, is, visible, light, emitted, from, fluorescent, paints, in, response, to, ultraviolet, blacklight, many, other, fluorescent, emissions, are, known, in, spectral, bands, other, than, visible, light, delayed, emission, is, called, phosphorescence, the, modern, theory, that, explains, the, nature, of, light, includes, the, notion, of, wave, particle, duality, together, wave, and, particle, effects, fully, explain, the, emission, and, absorption, spectra, of, em, radiation, the, matter, composition, of, the, medium, through, which, the, light, travels, determines, the, nature, of, the, absorption, and, emission, spectrum, these, bands, correspond, to, the, allowed, energy, levels, in, the, atoms, dark, bands, in, the, absorption, spectrum, are, due, to, the, atoms, in, an, intervening, medium, between, source, and, observer, the, atoms, absorb, certain, frequencies, of, the, light, between, emitter, and, detector, eye, then, emit, them, in, all, directions, a, dark, band, appears, to, the, detector, due, to, the, radiation, scattered, out, of, the, light, beam, for, instance, dark, bands, in, the, light, emitted, by, a, distant, star, are, due, to, the, atoms, in, the, star, s, atmosphere, a, similar, phenomenon, occurs, for, emission, which, is, seen, when, an, emitting, gas, glows, due, to, excitation, of, the, atoms, from, any, mechanism, including, heat, as, electrons, descend, to, lower, energy, levels, a, spectrum, is, emitted, that, represents, the, jumps, between, the, energy, levels, of, the, electrons, but, lines, are, seen, because, again, emission, happens, only, at, particular, energies, after, excitation, an, example, is, the, emission, spectrum, of, nebulae, rapidly, moving, electrons, are, most, sharply, accelerated, when, they, encounter, a, region, of, force, so, they, are, responsible, for, producing, much, of, the, highest, frequency, electromagnetic, radiation, observed, in, nature, these, phenomena, can, aid, various, chemical, determinations, for, the, composition, of, gases, lit, from, behind, absorption, spectra, and, for, glowing, gases, emission, spectra, spectroscopy, for, example, determines, what, chemical, elements, comprise, a, particular, star, spectroscopy, is, also, used, in, the, determination, of, the, distance, of, a, star, using, the, red, shift, when, any, wire, or, other, conducting, object, such, as, an, antenna, conducts, alternating, current, electromagnetic, radiation, is, propagated, at, the, same, frequency, as, the, current, as, a, wave, light, is, characterized, by, a, velocity, the, speed, of, light, wavelength, and, frequency, as, particles, light, is, a, stream, of, photons, each, has, an, energy, related, to, the, frequency, of, the, wave, given, by, planck, s, relation, e, hf, where, e, is, the, energy, of, the, photon, h, is, the, planck, constant, 6, 626, 10, 34, j, s, and, f, is, the, frequency, of, the, wave, in, a, medium, other, than, vacuum, velocity, factor, or, refractive, index, are, considered, depending, on, frequency, and, application, both, of, these, are, ratios, of, the, speed, in, a, medium, to, speed, in, a, vacuum, electromagnetic, radiation, of, wavelengths, other, than, those, of, visible, light, were, discovered, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, discovery, of, infrared, radiation, is, ascribed, to, astronomer, william, herschel, who, published, his, results, in, 1800, before, the, royal, society, of, london, herschel, used, a, glass, prism, to, refract, light, from, the, sun, and, detected, invisible, rays, that, caused, heating, beyond, the, red, part, of, the, spectrum, through, an, increase, in, the, temperature, recorded, with, a, thermometer, these, calorific, rays, were, later, termed, infrared, in, 1801, german, physicist, johann, wilhelm, ritter, discovered, ultraviolet, in, an, experiment, similar, to, herschel, s, using, sunlight, and, a, glass, prism, ritter, noted, that, invisible, rays, near, the, violet, edge, of, a, solar, spectrum, dispersed, by, a, triangular, prism, darkened, silver, chloride, preparations, more, quickly, than, did, the, nearby, violet, light, ritter, s, experiments, were, an, early, precursor, to, what, would, become, photography, ritter, noted, that, the, ultraviolet, rays, which, at, first, were, called, chemical, rays, were, capable, of, causing, chemical, reactions, in, 1862, 64, james, clerk, maxwell, developed, equations, for, the, electromagnetic, field, which, suggested, that, waves, in, the, field, would, travel, with, a, speed, that, was, very, close, to, the, known, speed, of, light, maxwell, therefore, suggested, that, visible, light, as, well, as, invisible, infrared, and, ultraviolet, rays, by, inference, all, consisted, of, propagating, disturbances, or, radiation, in, the, electromagnetic, field, radio, waves, were, first, produced, deliberately, by, heinrich, hertz, in, 1887, using, electrical, circuits, calculated, to, produce, oscillations, at, a, much, lower, frequency, than, that, of, visible, light, following, recipes, for, producing, oscillating, charges, and, currents, suggested, by, maxwell, s, equations, hertz, also, developed, ways, to, detect, these, waves, and, produced, and, characterized, what, were, later, termed, radio, waves, and, microwaves, 286, 7, wilhelm, r, ntgen, discovered, and, named, x, rays, after, experimenting, with, high, voltages, applied, to, an, evacuated, tube, on, 8, november, 1895, he, noticed, a, fluorescence, on, a, nearby, plate, of, coated, glass, in, one, month, he, discovered, x, rays, main, properties, 307, the, last, portion, of, the, em, spectrum, to, be, discovered, was, associated, with, radioactivity, henri, becquerel, found, that, uranium, salts, caused, fogging, of, an, unexposed, photographic, plate, through, a, covering, paper, in, a, manner, similar, to, x, rays, and, marie, curie, discovered, that, only, certain, elements, gave, off, these, rays, of, energy, soon, discovering, the, intense, radiation, of, radium, the, radiation, from, pitchblende, was, differentiated, into, alpha, rays, alpha, particles, and, beta, rays, beta, particles, by, ernest, rutherford, through, simple, experimentation, in, 1899, but, these, proved, to, be, charged, particulate, types, of, radiation, however, in, 1900, the, french, scientist, paul, villard, discovered, a, third, neutrally, charged, and, especially, penetrating, type, of, radiation, from, radium, and, after, he, described, it, rutherford, realized, it, must, be, yet, a, third, type, of, radiation, which, in, 1903, rutherford, named, gamma, rays, in, 1910, british, physicist, william, henry, bragg, demonstrated, that, gamma, rays, are, electromagnetic, radiation, not, particles, and, in, 1914, rutherford, and, edward, andrade, measured, their, wavelengths, finding, that, they, were, similar, to, x, rays, but, with, shorter, wavelengths, and, higher, frequency, although, a, cross, over, between, x, and, gamma, rays, makes, it, possible, to, have, x, rays, with, a, higher, energy, and, hence, shorter, wavelength, than, gamma, rays, and, vice, versa, the, origin, of, the, ray, differentiates, them, gamma, rays, tend, to, be, natural, phenomena, originating, from, the, unstable, nucleus, of, an, atom, and, x, rays, are, electrically, generated, and, hence, man, made, unless, they, are, as, a, result, of, bremsstrahlung, x, radiation, caused, by, the, interaction, of, fast, moving, particles, such, as, beta, particles, colliding, with, certain, materials, usually, of, higher, atomic, numbers, 308, 9, em, radiation, the, designation, radiation, excludes, static, electric, and, magnetic, and, near, fields, is, classified, by, wavelength, into, radio, microwave, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, x, rays, and, gamma, rays, arbitrary, electromagnetic, waves, can, be, expressed, by, fourier, analysis, in, terms, of, sinusoidal, waves, monochromatic, radiation, which, in, turn, can, each, be, classified, into, these, regions, of, the, emr, spectrum, for, certain, classes, of, em, waves, the, waveform, is, most, usefully, treated, as, random, and, then, spectral, analysis, must, be, done, by, slightly, different, mathematical, techniques, appropriate, to, random, or, stochastic, processes, in, such, cases, the, individual, frequency, components, are, represented, in, terms, of, their, power, content, and, the, phase, information, is, not, preserved, such, a, representation, is, called, the, power, spectral, density, of, the, random, process, random, electromagnetic, radiation, requiring, this, kind, of, analysis, is, for, example, encountered, in, the, interior, of, stars, and, in, certain, other, very, wideband, forms, of, radiation, such, as, the, zero, point, wave, field, of, the, electromagnetic, vacuum, the, behavior, of, em, radiation, and, its, interaction, with, matter, depends, on, its, frequency, and, changes, qualitatively, as, the, frequency, changes, lower, frequencies, have, longer, wavelengths, and, higher, frequencies, have, shorter, wavelengths, and, are, associated, with, photons, of, higher, energy, there, is, no, fundamental, limit, known, to, these, wavelengths, or, energies, at, either, end, of, the, spectrum, although, photons, with, energies, near, the, planck, energy, or, exceeding, it, far, too, high, to, have, ever, been, observed, will, require, new, physical, theories, to, describe, when, radio, waves, impinge, upon, a, conductor, they, couple, to, the, conductor, travel, along, it, and, induce, an, electric, current, on, the, conductor, surface, by, moving, the, electrons, of, the, conducting, material, in, correlated, bunches, of, charge, electromagnetic, radiation, phenomena, with, wavelengths, ranging, from, as, long, as, one, meter, to, as, short, as, one, millimeter, are, called, microwaves, with, frequencies, between, 300, mhz, 0, 3, ghz, and, 300, ghz, at, radio, and, microwave, frequencies, emr, interacts, with, matter, largely, as, a, bulk, collection, of, charges, which, are, spread, out, over, large, numbers, of, affected, atoms, in, electrical, conductors, such, induced, bulk, movement, of, charges, electric, currents, results, in, absorption, of, the, emr, or, else, separations, of, charges, that, cause, generation, of, new, emr, effective, reflection, of, the, emr, an, example, is, absorption, or, emission, of, radio, waves, by, antennas, or, absorption, of, microwaves, by, water, or, other, molecules, with, an, electric, dipole, moment, as, for, example, inside, a, microwave, oven, these, interactions, produce, either, electric, currents, or, heat, or, both, like, radio, and, microwave, infrared, ir, also, is, reflected, by, metals, and, also, most, emr, well, into, the, ultraviolet, range, however, unlike, lower, frequency, radio, and, microwave, radiation, infrared, emr, commonly, interacts, with, dipoles, present, in, single, molecules, which, change, as, atoms, vibrate, at, the, ends, of, a, single, chemical, bond, it, is, consequently, absorbed, by, a, wide, range, of, substances, causing, them, to, increase, in, temperature, as, the, vibrations, dissipate, as, heat, the, same, process, run, in, reverse, causes, bulk, substances, to, radiate, in, the, infrared, spontaneously, see, thermal, radiation, section, below, infrared, radiation, is, divided, into, spectral, subregions, while, different, subdivision, schemes, exist, the, spectrum, is, commonly, divided, as, near, infrared, 0, 75, 1, 4, m, short, wavelength, infrared, 1, 4, 3, m, mid, wavelength, infrared, 3, 8, m, long, wavelength, infrared, 8, 15, m, and, far, infrared, 15, 1000, m, natural, sources, produce, em, radiation, across, the, spectrum, em, radiation, with, a, wavelength, between, approximately, 400, nm, and, 700, nm, is, directly, detected, by, the, human, eye, and, perceived, as, visible, light, other, wavelengths, especially, nearby, infrared, longer, than, 700, nm, and, ultraviolet, shorter, than, 400, nm, are, also, sometimes, referred, to, as, light, as, frequency, increases, into, the, visible, range, photons, have, enough, energy, to, change, the, bond, structure, of, some, individual, molecules, it, is, not, a, coincidence, that, this, happens, in, the, visible, range, as, the, mechanism, of, vision, involves, the, change, in, bonding, of, a, single, molecule, retinal, which, absorbs, a, single, photon, the, change, in, retinal, causes, a, change, in, the, shape, of, the, rhodopsin, protein, it, is, contained, in, which, starts, the, biochemical, process, that, causes, the, retina, of, the, human, eye, to, sense, the, light, photosynthesis, becomes, possible, in, this, range, as, well, for, the, same, reason, a, single, molecule, of, chlorophyll, is, excited, by, a, single, photon, in, plant, tissues, that, conduct, photosynthesis, carotenoids, act, to, quench, electronically, excited, chlorophyll, produced, by, visible, light, in, a, process, called, non, photochemical, quenching, to, prevent, reactions, that, would, otherwise, interfere, with, photosynthesis, at, high, light, levels, animals, that, detect, infrared, make, use, of, small, packets, of, water, that, change, temperature, in, an, essentially, thermal, process, that, involves, many, photons, infrared, microwaves, and, radio, waves, are, known, to, damage, molecules, and, biological, tissue, only, by, bulk, heating, not, excitation, from, single, photons, of, the, radiation, visible, light, is, able, to, affect, only, a, tiny, percentage, of, all, molecules, usually, not, in, a, permanent, or, damaging, way, rather, the, photon, excites, an, electron, which, then, emits, another, photon, when, returning, to, its, original, position, this, is, the, source, of, color, produced, by, most, dyes, retinal, is, an, exception, when, a, photon, is, absorbed, the, retinal, permanently, changes, structure, from, cis, to, trans, and, requires, a, protein, to, convert, it, back, i, e, reset, it, to, be, able, to, function, as, a, light, detector, again, limited, evidence, indicate, that, some, reactive, oxygen, species, are, created, by, visible, light, in, skin, and, that, these, may, have, some, role, in, photoaging, in, the, same, manner, as, ultraviolet, a, as, frequency, increases, into, the, ultraviolet, photons, now, carry, enough, energy, about, three, electron, volts, or, more, to, excite, certain, doubly, bonded, molecules, into, permanent, chemical, rearrangement, in, dna, this, causes, lasting, damage, dna, is, also, indirectly, damaged, by, reactive, oxygen, species, produced, by, ultraviolet, a, uva, which, has, energy, too, low, to, damage, dna, directly, this, is, why, ultraviolet, at, all, wavelengths, can, damage, dna, and, is, capable, of, causing, cancer, and, for, uvb, skin, burns, sunburn, that, are, far, worse, than, would, be, produced, by, simple, heating, temperature, increase, effects, at, the, higher, end, of, the, ultraviolet, range, the, energy, of, photons, becomes, large, enough, to, impart, enough, energy, to, electrons, to, cause, them, to, be, liberated, from, the, atom, in, a, process, called, photoionisation, the, energy, required, for, this, is, always, larger, than, about, 10, electron, volt, ev, corresponding, with, wavelengths, smaller, than, 124, nm, some, sources, suggest, a, more, realistic, cutoff, of, 33, ev, which, is, the, energy, required, to, ionize, water, this, high, end, of, the, ultraviolet, spectrum, with, energies, in, the, approximate, ionization, range, is, sometimes, called, extreme, uv, ionizing, uv, is, strongly, filtered, by, the, earth, s, atmosphere, electromagnetic, radiation, composed, of, photons, that, carry, minimum, ionization, energy, or, more, which, includes, the, entire, spectrum, with, shorter, wavelengths, is, therefore, termed, ionizing, radiation, many, other, kinds, of, ionizing, radiation, are, made, of, non, em, particles, electromagnetic, type, ionizing, radiation, extends, from, the, extreme, ultraviolet, to, all, higher, frequencies, and, shorter, wavelengths, which, means, that, all, x, rays, and, gamma, rays, qualify, these, are, capable, of, the, most, severe, types, of, molecular, damage, which, can, happen, in, biology, to, any, type, of, biomolecule, including, mutation, and, cancer, and, often, at, great, depths, below, the, skin, since, the, higher, end, of, the, x, ray, spectrum, and, all, of, the, gamma, ray, spectrum, penetrate, matter, most, uv, and, x, rays, are, blocked, by, absorption, first, from, molecular, nitrogen, and, then, for, wavelengths, in, the, upper, uv, from, the, electronic, excitation, of, dioxygen, and, finally, ozone, at, the, mid, range, of, uv, only, 30, of, the, sun, s, ultraviolet, light, reaches, the, ground, and, almost, all, of, this, is, well, transmitted, visible, light, is, well, transmitted, in, air, a, property, known, as, an, atmospheric, window, as, it, is, not, energetic, enough, to, excite, nitrogen, oxygen, or, ozone, but, too, energetic, to, excite, molecular, vibrational, frequencies, of, water, vapor, and, co2, absorption, bands, in, the, infrared, are, due, to, modes, of, vibrational, excitation, in, water, vapor, however, at, energies, too, low, to, excite, water, vapor, the, atmosphere, becomes, transparent, again, allowing, free, transmission, of, most, microwave, and, radio, waves, finally, at, radio, wavelengths, longer, than, 10, m, or, so, about, 30, mhz, the, air, in, the, lower, atmosphere, remains, transparent, to, radio, but, plasma, in, certain, layers, of, the, ionosphere, begins, to, interact, with, radio, waves, see, skywave, this, property, allows, some, longer, wavelengths, 100, m, or, 3, mhz, to, be, reflected, and, results, in, shortwave, radio, beyond, line, of, sight, however, certain, ionospheric, effects, begin, to, block, incoming, radiowaves, from, space, when, their, frequency, is, less, than, about, 10, mhz, wavelength, longer, than, about, 30, m, the, basic, structure, of, matter, involves, charged, particles, bound, together, when, electromagnetic, radiation, impinges, on, matter, it, causes, the, charged, particles, to, oscillate, and, gain, energy, the, ultimate, fate, of, this, energy, depends, on, the, context, it, could, be, immediately, re, radiated, and, appear, as, scattered, reflected, or, transmitted, radiation, it, may, get, dissipated, into, other, microscopic, motions, within, the, matter, coming, to, thermal, equilibrium, and, manifesting, itself, as, thermal, energy, or, even, kinetic, energy, in, the, material, with, a, few, exceptions, related, to, high, energy, photons, such, as, fluorescence, harmonic, generation, photochemical, reactions, the, photovoltaic, effect, for, ionizing, radiations, at, far, ultraviolet, x, ray, and, gamma, radiation, absorbed, electromagnetic, radiation, simply, deposits, its, energy, by, heating, the, material, this, happens, for, infrared, microwave, and, radio, wave, radiation, intense, radio, waves, can, thermally, burn, living, tissue, and, can, cook, food, in, addition, to, infrared, lasers, sufficiently, intense, visible, and, ultraviolet, lasers, can, easily, set, paper, afire, ionizing, radiation, creates, high, speed, electrons, in, a, material, and, breaks, chemical, bonds, but, after, these, electrons, collide, many, times, with, other, atoms, eventually, most, of, the, energy, becomes, thermal, energy, all, in, a, tiny, fraction, of, a, second, this, process, makes, ionizing, radiation, far, more, dangerous, per, unit, of, energy, than, non, ionizing, radiation, this, caveat, also, applies, to, uv, even, though, almost, all, of, it, is, not, ionizing, because, uv, can, damage, molecules, due, to, electronic, excitation, which, is, far, greater, per, unit, energy, than, heating, effects, infrared, radiation, in, the, spectral, distribution, of, a, black, body, is, usually, considered, a, form, of, heat, since, it, has, an, equivalent, temperature, and, is, associated, with, an, entropy, change, per, unit, of, thermal, energy, however, heat, is, a, technical, term, in, physics, and, thermodynamics, and, is, often, confused, with, thermal, energy, any, type, of, electromagnetic, energy, can, be, transformed, into, thermal, energy, in, interaction, with, matter, thus, any, electromagnetic, radiation, can, heat, in, the, sense, of, increase, the, thermal, energy, temperature, of, a, material, when, it, is, absorbed, the, inverse, or, time, reversed, process, of, absorption, is, thermal, radiation, much, of, the, thermal, energy, in, matter, consists, of, random, motion, of, charged, particles, and, this, energy, can, be, radiated, away, from, the, matter, the, resulting, radiation, may, subsequently, be, absorbed, by, another, piece, of, matter, with, the, deposited, energy, heating, the, material, the, electromagnetic, radiation, in, an, opaque, cavity, at, thermal, equilibrium, is, effectively, a, form, of, thermal, energy, having, maximum, radiation, entropy, bioelectromagnetics, is, the, study, of, the, interactions, and, effects, of, em, radiation, on, living, organisms, the, effects, of, electromagnetic, radiation, upon, living, cells, including, those, in, humans, depends, upon, the, radiation, s, power, and, frequency, for, low, frequency, radiation, radio, waves, to, near, ultraviolet, the, best, understood, effects, are, those, due, to, radiation, power, alone, acting, through, heating, when, radiation, is, absorbed, for, these, thermal, effects, frequency, is, important, as, it, affects, the, intensity, of, the, radiation, and, penetration, into, the, organism, for, example, microwaves, penetrate, better, than, infrared, it, is, widely, accepted, that, low, frequency, fields, that, are, too, weak, to, cause, significant, heating, could, not, possibly, have, any, biological, effect, some, research, suggests, that, weaker, non, thermal, electromagnetic, fields, including, weak, elf, magnetic, fields, although, the, latter, does, not, strictly, qualify, as, em, radiation, and, modulated, rf, and, microwave, fields, can, have, biological, effects, though, the, significance, of, this, is, unclear, the, world, health, organization, has, classified, radio, frequency, electromagnetic, radiation, as, group, 2b, possibly, carcinogenic, this, group, contains, possible, carcinogens, such, as, lead, ddt, and, styrene, at, higher, frequencies, some, of, visible, and, beyond, the, effects, of, individual, photons, begin, to, become, important, as, these, now, have, enough, energy, individually, to, directly, or, indirectly, damage, biological, molecules, all, uv, frequencies, have, been, classed, as, group, 1, carcinogens, by, the, world, health, organization, ultraviolet, radiation, from, sun, exposure, is, the, primary, cause, of, skin, cancer, thus, at, uv, frequencies, and, higher, electromagnetic, radiation, does, more, damage, to, biological, systems, than, simple, heating, predicts, this, is, most, obvious, in, the, far, or, extreme, ultraviolet, uv, with, x, ray, and, gamma, radiation, are, referred, to, as, ionizing, radiation, due, to, the, ability, of, photons, of, this, radiation, to, produce, ions, and, free, radicals, in, materials, including, living, tissue, since, such, radiation, can, severely, damage, life, at, energy, levels, that, produce, little, heating, it, is, considered, far, more, dangerous, in, terms, of, damage, produced, per, unit, of, energy, or, power, than, the, rest, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, the, heat, ray, is, an, application, of, emr, that, makes, use, of, microwave, frequencies, to, create, an, unpleasant, heating, effect, in, the, upper, layer, of, the, skin, a, publicly, known, heat, ray, weapon, called, the, active, denial, system, was, developed, by, the, us, military, as, an, experimental, weapon, to, deny, the, enemy, access, to, an, area, a, death, ray, is, a, theoretical, weapon, that, delivers, heat, ray, based, on, electromagnetic, energy, at, levels, that, are, capable, of, injuring, human, tissue, an, inventor, of, a, death, ray, harry, grindell, matthews, claimed, to, have, lost, sight, in, his, left, eye, while, working, on, his, death, ray, weapon, based, on, a, microwave, magnetron, from, the, 1920s, a, normal, microwave, oven, creates, a, tissue, damaging, cooking, effect, inside, the, oven, at, around, 2, kv, m, electromagnetic, waves, are, predicted, by, the, classical, laws, of, electricity, and, magnetism, known, as, maxwell, s, equations, there, are, nontrivial, solutions, of, the, homogeneous, maxwell, s, equations, without, charges, or, currents, describing, waves, of, changing, electric, and, magnetic, fields, beginning, with, maxwell, s, equations, in, free, space, where, besides, the, trivial, solution, e, b, 0, displaystyle, mathbf, e, mathbf, b, mathbf, 0,

maxwell, equation, 4, yields, combining, 6, and, 7, again, gives, a, vector, valued, differential, equation, for, the, electric, field, solving, the, homogeneous, maxwell, equations, 2, e, 0, 0, 2, e,

b, far, fields, in, free, space, which, as, wave, solutions, depend, primarily, on, these, two, maxwell, equations, are, in, phase, with, each, other, this, is, guaranteed, since, the, generic, wave, solution, is, first, order, in, both, space, and, time, and, the, curl, operator, on, one, side, of, these, equations, results, in, first, order, spatial, derivatives, of, the, wave, solution, while, the, time, derivative, on, the, other, side, of, the, equations, which, gives, the, other, field, is, first, order, in, time, resulting, in, the, same, phase, shift, for, both, fields, in, each, mathematical, operation, from, the, viewpoint, of, an, electromagnetic, wave, traveling, forward, the, electric, field, might, be, oscillating, up, and, down, while, the, magnetic, field, oscillates, right, and, left, this, picture, can, be, rotated, with, the, electric, field, oscillating, right, and, left, and, the, magnetic, field, oscillating, down, and, up, this, is, a, different, solution, that, is, traveling, in, the, same, direction, this, arbitrariness, in, the, orientation, with, respect, to, propagation, direction, is, known, as, polarization, on, a, quantum, level, it, is, described, as, photon, polarization, the, direction, of, the, polarization, is, defined, as, the, direction, of, the, electric, field, more, general, forms, of, the, second, order, wave, equations, given, above, are, available, allowing, for, both, non, vacuum, propagation, media, and, sources, many, competing, derivations, exist, all, with, varying, levels, of, approximation, and, intended, applications, one, very, general, example, is, a, form, of, the, electric, field, equation, which, was, factorized, into, a, pair, of, explicitly, directional, wave, equations, and, then, efficiently, reduced, into, a, single, uni, directional, wave, equation, by, means, of, a, simple, slow, evolution, approximation
