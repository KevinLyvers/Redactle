a, solstice, is, the, time, when, the, sun, reaches, its, most, northerly, or, southerly, excursion, relative, to, the, celestial, equator, on, the, celestial, sphere, two, solstices, occur, annually, around, 20, 22, june, and, 20, 22, december, in, many, countries, the, seasons, of, the, year, are, defined, by, reference, to, the, solstices, and, the, equinoxes, the, term, solstice, can, also, be, used, in, a, broader, sense, as, the, day, when, this, occurs, for, locations, not, too, close, to, the, equator, or, the, poles, the, dates, with, the, longest, and, shortest, periods, of, daylight, are, the, summer, and, winter, solstices, respectively, terms, with, no, ambiguity, as, to, which, hemisphere, is, the, context, are, june, solstice, and, december, solstice, referring, to, the, months, in, which, they, take, place, every, year, the, word, solstice, is, derived, from, the, latin, sol, sun, and, sistere, to, stand, still, because, at, the, solstices, the, sun, s, declination, appears, to, stand, still, that, is, the, seasonal, movement, of, the, sun, s, daily, path, as, seen, from, earth, pauses, at, a, northern, or, southern, limit, before, reversing, direction, for, an, observer, at, the, north, pole, the, sun, reaches, the, highest, position, in, the, sky, once, a, year, in, june, the, day, this, occurs, is, called, the, june, solstice, day, similarly, for, an, observer, on, the, south, pole, the, sun, reaches, the, highest, position, on, the, december, solstice, day, when, it, is, the, summer, solstice, at, one, pole, it, is, the, winter, solstice, on, the, other, the, sun, s, westerly, motion, never, ceases, as, earth, is, continually, in, rotation, however, the, sun, s, motion, in, declination, i, e, vertically, comes, to, a, stop, before, reversing, at, the, moment, of, solstice, in, that, sense, solstice, means, sun, standing, this, modern, scientific, word, descends, from, a, latin, scientific, word, in, use, in, the, late, roman, republic, of, the, 1st, century, bc, solstitium, pliny, uses, it, a, number, of, times, in, his, natural, history, with, a, similar, meaning, that, it, has, today, it, contains, two, latin, language, morphemes, sol, sun, and, stitium, stoppage, the, romans, used, standing, to, refer, to, a, component, of, the, relative, velocity, of, the, sun, as, it, is, observed, in, the, sky, relative, velocity, is, the, motion, of, an, object, from, the, point, of, view, of, an, observer, in, a, frame, of, reference, from, a, fixed, position, on, the, ground, the, sun, appears, to, orbit, around, earth, to, an, observer, in, an, inertial, frame, of, reference, planet, earth, is, seen, to, rotate, about, an, axis, and, orbit, around, the, sun, in, an, elliptical, path, with, the, sun, at, one, focus, earth, s, axis, is, tilted, with, respect, to, the, plane, of, earth, s, orbit, and, this, axis, maintains, a, position, that, changes, little, with, respect, to, the, background, of, stars, an, observer, on, earth, therefore, sees, a, solar, path, that, is, the, result, of, both, rotation, and, revolution, the, component, of, the, sun, s, motion, seen, by, an, earthbound, observer, caused, by, the, revolution, of, the, tilted, axis, which, keeping, the, same, angle, in, space, is, oriented, toward, or, away, from, the, sun, is, an, observed, daily, increment, and, lateral, offset, of, the, elevation, of, the, sun, at, noon, for, approximately, six, months, and, observed, daily, decrement, for, the, remaining, six, months, at, maximum, or, minimum, elevation, the, relative, yearly, motion, of, the, sun, perpendicular, to, the, horizon, stops, and, reverses, direction, outside, of, the, tropics, the, maximum, elevation, occurs, at, the, summer, solstice, and, the, minimum, at, the, winter, solstice, the, path, of, the, sun, or, ecliptic, sweeps, north, and, south, between, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, the, lengths, time, when, the, sun, is, up, are, longer, around, the, summer, solstice, and, shorter, around, the, winter, solstice, except, near, the, equator, when, the, sun, s, path, crosses, the, equator, the, length, of, the, nights, at, latitudes, l, and, l, are, of, equal, length, this, is, known, as, an, equinox, there, are, two, solstices, and, two, equinoxes, in, a, tropical, year, because, of, the, variation, in, the, rate, at, which, the, sun, s, right, ascension, changes, the, days, of, longest, and, shortest, daylight, do, not, coincide, with, the, solstices, for, locations, very, close, to, the, equator, at, the, equator, the, longest, day, is, around, december, 23, and, the, shortest, around, september, 16, see, graph, inside, the, arctic, or, antarctic, circles, the, sun, is, up, all, the, time, for, days, or, even, months, the, seasons, occur, because, the, earth, s, axis, of, rotation, is, not, perpendicular, to, its, orbital, plane, the, plane, of, the, ecliptic, but, currently, makes, an, angle, of, about, 23, 44, called, the, obliquity, of, the, ecliptic, and, because, the, axis, keeps, its, orientation, with, respect, to, an, inertial, frame, of, reference, as, a, consequence, for, half, the, year, the, northern, hemisphere, is, inclined, toward, the, sun, while, for, the, other, half, year, the, southern, hemisphere, has, this, distinction, the, two, moments, when, the, inclination, of, earth, s, rotational, axis, has, maximum, effect, are, the, solstices, at, the, june, solstice, the, subsolar, point, is, further, north, than, any, other, time, at, latitude, 23, 44, north, known, as, the, tropic, of, cancer, similarly, at, the, december, solstice, the, subsolar, point, is, further, south, than, any, other, time, at, latitude, 23, 44, south, known, as, the, tropic, of, capricorn, the, subsolar, point, will, cross, every, latitude, between, these, two, extremes, exactly, twice, per, year, also, during, the, june, solstice, places, on, the, arctic, circle, latitude, 66, 56, north, will, see, the, sun, just, on, the, horizon, during, midnight, and, all, places, north, of, it, will, see, the, sun, above, horizon, for, 24, hours, that, is, the, midnight, sun, or, midsummer, night, sun, or, polar, day, on, the, other, hand, places, on, the, antarctic, circle, latitude, 66, 56, south, will, see, the, sun, just, on, the, horizon, during, midday, and, all, places, south, of, it, will, not, see, the, sun, above, horizon, at, any, time, of, the, day, that, is, the, polar, night, during, the, december, solstice, the, effects, on, both, hemispheres, are, just, the, opposite, this, sees, polar, sea, ice, re, grow, annually, due, to, lack, of, sunlight, on, the, air, above, and, surrounding, sea, the, warmest, and, coldest, periods, of, the, year, in, temperate, regions, are, offset, by, about, one, month, from, the, solstices, delayed, by, the, earth, s, thermal, inertia, the, concept, of, the, solstices, was, embedded, in, ancient, greek, celestial, navigation, as, soon, as, they, discovered, that, the, earth, was, spherical, they, devised, the, concept, of, the, celestial, sphere, an, imaginary, spherical, surface, rotating, with, the, heavenly, bodies, ouranioi, fixed, in, it, the, modern, one, does, not, rotate, but, the, stars, in, it, do, as, long, as, no, assumptions, are, made, concerning, the, distances, of, those, bodies, from, earth, or, from, each, other, the, sphere, can, be, accepted, as, real, and, is, in, fact, still, in, use, the, ancient, greeks, use, the, term, heliost, sio, meaning, stand, of, the, sun, the, stars, move, across, the, inner, surface, of, the, celestial, sphere, along, the, circumferences, of, circles, in, parallel, planes, perpendicular, to, the, earth, s, axis, extended, indefinitely, into, the, heavens, and, intersecting, the, celestial, sphere, in, a, celestial, pole, the, sun, and, the, planets, do, not, move, in, these, parallel, paths, but, along, another, circle, the, ecliptic, whose, plane, is, at, an, angle, the, obliquity, of, the, ecliptic, to, the, axis, bringing, the, sun, and, planets, across, the, paths, of, and, in, among, the, stars, cleomedes, states, the, band, of, the, zodiac, z, diakos, kuklos, zodiacal, circle, is, at, an, oblique, angle, loksos, because, it, is, positioned, between, the, tropical, circles, and, equinoctial, circle, touching, each, of, the, tropical, circles, at, one, point, this, zodiac, has, a, determinable, width, set, at, 8, today, that, is, why, it, is, described, by, three, circles, the, central, one, is, called, heliacal, h, liakos, of, the, sun, the, term, heliacal, circle, is, used, for, the, ecliptic, which, is, in, the, center, of, the, zodiacal, circle, conceived, as, a, band, including, the, noted, constellations, named, on, mythical, themes, other, authors, use, zodiac, to, mean, ecliptic, which, first, appears, in, a, gloss, of, unknown, author, in, a, passage, of, cleomedes, where, he, is, explaining, that, the, moon, is, in, the, zodiacal, circle, as, well, and, periodically, crosses, the, path, of, the, sun, as, some, of, these, crossings, represent, eclipses, of, the, moon, the, path, of, the, sun, is, given, a, synonym, the, ekleiptikos, kuklos, from, ekleipsis, eclipse, the, two, solstices, can, be, distinguished, by, different, pairs, of, names, depending, on, which, feature, one, wants, to, stress, gregorian, calendar, subsolar, point, northern, hemisphere, southern, hemisphere, the, traditional, east, asian, calendars, divide, a, year, into, 24, solar, terms, xi, zh, p, ny, n, or, geshi, r, maji, chinese, and, japanese, korean, haji, vietnamese, h, ch, summer, s, extreme, is, the, 10th, solar, term, and, marks, the, summer, solstice, it, begins, when, the, sun, reaches, the, celestial, longitude, of, 90, around, june, 21, and, ends, when, the, sun, reaches, the, longitude, of, 105, around, july, 7, xi, zh, more, often, refers, in, particular, to, the, day, when, the, sun,

and, marks, the, winter, solstice, it, begins, when, the, sun, reaches, the, celestial, longitude, of, 270, around, december, 22, and, ends, when, the, sun, reaches, the, longitude, of, 285, around, january, 5, d, ngzh, more, often, refers, in, particular, to, the, day, when, the, sun, is, exactly, at, the, celestial, longitude, of, 270, the, solstices, as, well, as, the, equinoxes, mark, the, middle, of, the, seasons, in, east, asian, calendars, here, the, chinese, character, means, extreme, so, the, terms, for, the, solstices, directly, signify, the, summits, of, summer, and, winter, the, term, solstice, can, also, be, used, in, a, wider, sense, as, the, date, day, that, such, a, passage, happens, the, solstices, together, with, the, equinoxes, are, connected, with, the, seasons, in, some, languages, they, are, considered, to, start, or, separate, the, seasons, in, others, they, are, considered, to, be, centre, points, in, england, in, the, northern, hemisphere, for, example, the, period, around, the, northern, solstice, is, known, as, midsummer, midsummer, s, day, defined, as, st, johns, day, by, the, christian, church, is, june, 24, about, three, days, after, the, solstice, itself, similarly, december, 25, is, the, start, of, the, christmas, celebration, and, is, the, day, the, sun, begins, to, return, to, the, northern, hemisphere, the, traditional, british, and, irish, main, rent, and, meeting, days, of, the, year, the, usual, quarter, days, were, often, those, of, the, solstices, and, equinoxes, many, cultures, celebrate, various, combinations, of, the, winter, and, summer, solstices, the, equinoxes, and, the, midpoints, between, them, leading, to, various, holidays, arising, around, these, events, during, the, southern, or, winter, solstice, christmas, is, the, most, widespread, contemporary, holiday, while, yalda, saturnalia, karachun, hanukkah, kwanzaa, and, yule, are, also, celebrated, around, this, time, in, east, asian, cultures, the, dongzhi, festival, is, celebrated, on, the, winter, solstice, for, the, northern, or, summer, solstice, christian, cultures, celebrate, the, feast, of, st, john, from, june, 23, to, 24, see, st, john, s, eve, ivan, kupala, day, while, modern, pagans, observe, midsummer, known, as, litha, among, wiccans, for, the, vernal, spring, equinox, several, springtime, festivals, are, celebrated, such, as, the, persian, nowruz, the, observance, in, judaism, of, passover, the, rites, of, easter, in, most, christian, churches, as, well, as, the, wiccan, ostara, the, autumnal, equinox, is, associated, with, the, jewish, holiday, of, sukkot, and, the, wiccan, mabon, in, the, southern, tip, of, south, america, the, mapuche, people, celebrate, we, tripantu, the, new, year, a, few, days, after, the, northern, solstice, on, june, 24, further, north, the, atacama, people, formerly, celebrated, this, date, with, a, noise, festival, to, call, the, sun, back, further, east, the, aymara, people, celebrate, their, new, year, on, june, 21, a, celebration, occurs, at, sunrise, when, the, sun, shines, directly, through, the, gate, of, the, sun, in, tiwanaku, other, aymara, new, year, feasts, occur, throughout, bolivia, including, at, the, site, of, el, fuerte, de, samaipata, in, the, hindu, calendar, two, sidereal, solstices, are, named, makara, sankranti, which, marks, the, start, of, uttarayana, and, karka, sankranti, which, marks, the, start, of, dakshinayana, the, former, occurs, around, january, 14, each, year, while, the, latter, occurs, around, july, 14, each, year, these, mark, the, movement, of, the, sun, along, a, sidereally, fixed, zodiac, precession, is, ignored, into, makara, the, zodiacal, sign, which, corresponds, with, capricorn, and, into, karka, the, zodiacal, sign, which, corresponds, with, cancer, respectively, the, amundsen, scott, south, pole, station, celebrates, every, year, on, june, 21, a, midwinter, party, to, celebrate, that, the, sun, is, at, its, lowest, point, and, coming, back, the, fremont, solstice, parade, takes, place, every, summer, solstice, in, fremont, seattle, washington, in, the, united, states, the, reconstructed, cahokia, woodhenge, a, large, timber, circle, located, at, the, mississippian, culture, cahokia, archaeological, site, near, collinsville, illinois, is, the, site, of, annual, equinox, and, solstice, sunrise, observances, out, of, respect, for, native, american, beliefs, these, events, do, not, feature, ceremonies, or, rituals, of, any, kind, unlike, the, equinox, the, solstice, time, is, not, easy, to, determine, the, changes, in, solar, declination, become, smaller, as, the, sun, gets, closer, to, its, maximum, minimum, declination, the, days, before, and, after, the, solstice, the, declination, speed, is, less, than, 30, arcseconds, per, day, which, is, less, than, 1, 60, of, the, angular, size, of, the, sun, or, the, equivalent, to, just, 2, seconds, of, right, ascension, this, difference, is, hardly, detectable, with, indirect, viewing, based, devices, like, sextant, equipped, with, a, vernier, and, impossible, with, more, traditional, tools, like, a, gnomon, or, an, astrolabe, it, is, also, hard, to, detect, the, changes, in, sunrise, sunset, azimuth, due, to, the, atmospheric, refraction, changes, those, accuracy, issues, render, it, impossible, to, determine, the, solstice, day, based, on, observations, made, within, the, 3, or, even, 5, days, surrounding, the, solstice, without, the, use, of, more, complex, tools, accounts, do, not, survive, but, greek, astronomers, must, have, used, an, approximation, method, based, on, interpolation, which, is, still, used, by, some, amateurs, this, method, consists, of, recording, the, declination, angle, at, noon, during, some, days, before, and, after, the, solstice, trying, to, find, two, separate, days, with, the, same, declination, when, those, two, days, are, found, the, halfway, time, between, both, noons, is, estimated, solstice, time, an, interval, of, 45, days, has, been, postulated, as, the, best, one, to, achieve, up, to, a, quarter, day, precision, in, the, solstice, determination, in, 2012, the, journal, dio, found, that, accuracy, of, one, or, two, hours, with, balanced, errors, can, be, attained, by, observing, the, sun, s, equal, altitudes, about, s, twenty, degrees, or, d, about, 20, days, before, and, after, the, summer, solstice, because, the, average, of, the, two, times, will, be, early, by, q, arc, minutes, where, q, is, e, cosa, 3, times, the, square, of, s, in, degrees, e, earth, orbit, eccentricity, a, earth, s, perihelion, or, sun, s, apogee, and, the, noise, in, the, result, will, be, about, 41, hours, divided, by, d, if, the, eye, s, sharpness, is, taken, as, one, arc, minute, astronomical, almanacs, define, the, solstices, as, the, moments, when, the, sun, passes, through, the, solstitial, colure, i, e, the, times, when, the, apparent, geocentric, celestial, longitude, of, the, sun, is, equal, to, 90, june, solstice, or, 270, december, solstice, the, dates, of, the, solstice, varies, each, year, and, may, occur, a, day, earlier, or, later, depending, on, the, time, zone, because, the, earth, s, orbit, takes, slightly, longer, than, a, calendar, year, of, 365, days, the, solstices, occur, slightly, later, each, calendar, year, until, a, leap, day, re, aligns, the, calendar, with, the, orbit, thus, the, solstices, always, occur, between, june, 20, and, 22, and, between, december, 20, and, 23, in, a, four, year, long, cycle, with, the, 21st, and, 22nd, being, the, most, common, dates, as, can, be, seen, in, the, schedule, at, the, start, of, the, article, using, the, current, official, iau, constellation, boundaries, and, taking, into, account, the, variable, precession, speed, and, the, rotation, of, the, ecliptic, the, solstices, shift, through, the, constellations, as, follows, expressed, in, astronomical, year, numbering, in, which, the, year, 0, 1, bc, 1, 2, bc, etc
