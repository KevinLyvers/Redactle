a, geyser, a, z, r, uk, i, z, r, is, a, spring, with, an, intermittent, discharge, of, water, ejected, turbulently, and, accompanied, by, steam, the, formation, of, geysers, is, fairly, rare, and, is, caused, by, particular, hydrogeological, conditions, that, exist, only, in, a, few, places, on, earth, generally, geyser, field, sites, are, located, near, active, volcanic, areas, and, the, geyser, effect, is, due, to, the, proximity, of, magma, surface, water, works, its, way, down, to, an, average, depth, of, around, 2, 000, metres, 6, 600, ft, where, it, contacts, hot, rocks, the, pressurized, water, boils, and, this, causes, the, geyser, effect, of, hot, water, and, steam, spraying, out, of, the, geyser, s, surface, vent, a, geyser, s, eruptive, activity, may, change, or, cease, due, to, ongoing, mineral, deposition, within, the, geyser, plumbing, exchange, of, functions, with, nearby, hot, springs, earthquake, influences, and, human, intervention, like, many, other, natural, phenomena, geysers, are, not, unique, to, earth, jet, like, eruptions, often, referred, to, as, cryogeysers, have, been, observed, on, several, of, the, moons, of, the, outer, solar, system, due, to, the, low, ambient, pressures, these, eruptions, consist, of, vapor, without, liquid, they, are, made, more, easily, visible, by, particles, of, dust, and, ice, carried, aloft, by, the, gas, water, vapor, jets, have, been, observed, near, the, south, pole, of, saturn, s, moon, enceladus, while, nitrogen, eruptions, have, been, observed, on, neptune, s, moon, triton, there, are, also, signs, of, carbon, dioxide, eruptions, from, the, southern, polar, ice, cap, of, mars, in, the, case, of, enceladus, the, plumes, are, believed, to, be, driven, by, internal, energy, in, the, cases, of, the, venting, on, mars, and, triton, the, activity, may, be, a, result, of, solar, heating, via, a, solid, state, greenhouse, effect, in, all, three, cases, there, is, no, evidence, of, the, subsurface, hydrological, system, which, differentiates, terrestrial, geysers, from, other, sorts, of, venting, such, as, fumaroles, the, term, geyser, in, english, dates, back, to, the, late, 18th, century, and, comes, from, geysir, which, is, a, geyser, in, iceland, its, name, means, one, who, gushes, geysers, are, nonpermanent, geological, features, geysers, are, generally, associated, with, volcanic, areas, as, the, water, boils, the, resulting, pressure, forces, a, superheated, column, of, steam, and, water, to, the, surface, through, the, geyser, s, internal, plumbing, the, formation, of, geysers, specifically, requires, the, combination, of, three, geologic, conditions, that, are, usually, found, in, volcanic, terrain, intense, heat, water, and, a, waterworks, system, the, heat, needed, for, geyser, formation, comes, from, magma, that, needs, to, be, close, to, the, surface, of, the, earth, in, order, for, the, heated, water, to, form, a, geyser, a, plumbing, system, made, of, fractures, fissures, porous, spaces, and, sometimes, cavities, is, required, this, includes, a, reservoir, to, hold, the, water, while, it, is, being, heated, geysers, are, generally, aligned, along, faults, geyser, activity, like, all, hot, spring, activity, is, caused, by, surface, water, gradually, seeping, down, through, the, ground, until, it, meets, rock, heated, by, magma, in, non, eruptive, hot, springs, the, geothermally, heated, water, then, rises, back, toward, the, surface, by, convection, through, porous, and, fractured, rocks, while, in, geysers, the, water, instead, is, explosively, forced, upwards, by, the, high, steam, pressure, created, when, water, boils, below, geysers, also, differ, from, non, eruptive, hot, springs, in, their, subterranean, structure, many, consist, of, a, small, vent, at, the, surface, connected, to, one, or, more, narrow, tubes, that, lead, to, underground, reservoirs, of, water, and, pressure, tight, rock, as, the, geyser, fills, the, water, at, the, top, of, the, column, cools, off, but, because, of, the, narrowness, of, the, channel, convective, cooling, of, the, water, in, the, reservoir, is, impossible, the, cooler, water, above, presses, down, on, the, hotter, water, beneath, not, unlike, the, lid, of, a, pressure, cooker, allowing, the, water, in, the, reservoir, to, become, superheated, i, e, to, remain, liquid, at, temperatures, well, above, the, standard, pressure, boiling, point, ultimately, the, temperatures, near, the, bottom, of, the, geyser, rise, to, a, point, where, boiling, begins, forcing, steam, bubbles, to, rise, to, the, top, of, the, column, as, they, burst, through, the, geyser, s, vent, some, water, overflows, or, splashes, out, reducing, the, weight, of, the, column, and, thus, the, pressure, on, the, water, below, with, this, release, of, pressure, the, superheated, water, flashes, into, steam, boiling, violently, throughout, the, column, the, resulting, froth, of, expanding, steam, and, hot, water, then, sprays, out, of, the, geyser, vent, a, key, requirement, that, enables, a, geyser, to, erupt, is, a, material, called, geyserite, found, in, rocks, near, the, geyser, geyserite, mostly, silicon, dioxide, sio, 2, is, dissolved, from, the, rocks, and, is, deposited, on, the, walls, of, the, geyser, s, plumbing, system, and, on, the, surface, the, deposits, make, the, channels, carrying, the, water, up, to, the, surface, pressure, tight, this, allows, the, pressure, to, be, carried, all, the, way, to, the, top, and, not, leak, out, into, the, loose, gravel, or, soil, that, are, normally, under, the, geyser, fields, eventually, the, water, remaining, in, the, geyser, cools, back, to, below, the, boiling, point, and, the, eruption, ends, heated, groundwater, begins, seeping, back, into, the, reservoir, and, the, whole, cycle, begins, again, the, duration, of, eruptions, and, the, time, between, successive, eruptions, vary, greatly, from, geyser, to, geyser, strokkur, in, iceland, erupts, for, a, few, seconds, every, few, minutes, while, grand, geyser, in, the, united, states, erupts, for, up, to, 10, minutes, every, 8, 12, hours, there, are, two, types, of, geysers, fountain, geysers, which, erupt, from, pools, of, water, typically, in, a, series, of, intense, even, violent, bursts, and, cone, geysers, which, erupt, from, cones, or, mounds, of, siliceous, sinter, including, geyserite, usually, in, steady, jets, that, last, anywhere, from, a, few, seconds, to, several, minutes, old, faithful, perhaps, the, best, known, geyser, at, yellowstone, national, park, is, an, example, of, a, cone, geyser, grand, geyser, the, tallest, predictable, geyser, on, earth, although, geysir, in, iceland, is, taller, it, is, not, predictable, also, at, yellowstone, national, park, is, an, example, of, a, fountain, geyser, there, are, many, volcanic, areas, in, the, world, that, have, hot, springs, mud, pots, and, fumaroles, but, very, few, have, erupting, geysers, the, main, reason, for, their, rarity, is, that, multiple, intense, transient, forces, must, occur, simultaneously, for, a, geyser, to, exist, for, example, even, when, other, necessary, conditions, exist, if, the, rock, structure, is, loose, eruptions, will, erode, the, channels, and, rapidly, destroy, any, nascent, geysers, geysers, are, fragile, and, if, conditions, change, they, may, go, dormant, or, extinct, many, have, been, destroyed, simply, by, people, throwing, debris, into, them, while, others, have, ceased, to, erupt, due, to, dewatering, by, geothermal, power, plants, however, the, geysir, in, iceland, has, had, periods, of, activity, and, dormancy, during, its, long, dormant, periods, eruptions, were, sometimes, artificially, induced, often, on, special, occasions, by, the, addition, of, surfactant, soaps, to, the, water, some, geysers, have, specific, colours, because, despite, the, harsh, conditions, life, is, often, found, in, them, and, also, in, other, hot, habitats, in, the, form, of, thermophilic, prokaryotes, no, known, eukaryote, can, survive, over, 60, c, 140, f, in, the, 1960s, when, the, research, of, the, biology, of, geysers, first, appeared, scientists, were, generally, convinced, that, no, life, can, survive, above, around, 73, c, maximum, 163, f, the, upper, limit, for, the, survival, of, cyanobacteria, as, the, structure, of, key, cellular, proteins, and, deoxyribonucleic, acid, dna, would, be, destroyed, the, optimal, temperature, for, thermophilic, bacteria, was, placed, even, lower, around, 55, c, average, 131, f, however, the, observations, proved, that, can, exist, at, high, temperatures, and, that, some, bacteria, even, prefer, temperatures, higher, than, the, boiling, point, of, water, dozens, of, such, bacteria, are, known, thermophiles, prefer, temperatures, from, 50, to, 70, c, 122, to, 158, f, whilst, hyperthermophiles, grow, better, at, temperatures, as, high, as, 80, to, 110, c, 176, to, 230, f, as, they, have, heat, stable, enzymes, that, retain, their, activity, even, at, high, temperatures, they, have, been, used, as, a, source, of, thermostable, tools, which, are, important, in, medicine, and, biotechnology, for, example, in, manufacturing, antibiotics, plastics, detergents, by, the, use, of, heat, stable, enzymes, lipases, pullulanases, and, proteases, and, fermentation, products, for, example, ethanol, is, produced, among, these, the, first, discovered, and, the, most, important, for, biotechnology, is, thermus, aquaticus, geysers, are, quite, rare, requiring, a, combination, of, water, heat, and, fortuitous, plumbing, the, combination, exists, in, few, places, on, earth, yellowstone, is, the, largest, geyser, locale, containing, thousands, of, hot, springs, and, approximately, 300, to, 500, geysers, it, is, home, to, half, of, the, world, s, total, number, of, geysers, in, its, nine, geyser, basins, it, is, located, mostly, in, wyoming, usa, with, small, portions, in, montana, and, idaho, yellowstone, includes, the, world, s, tallest, active, geyser, steamboat, geyser, in, norris, geyser, basin, the, valley, of, geysers, russian, located, in, the, kamchatka, peninsula, of, russia, is, the, second, largest, concentration, of, geysers, in, the, world, the, area, was, discovered, and, explored, by, tatyana, ustinova, in, 1941, there, are, about, 200, geysers, in, the, area, along, with, many, hot, water, springs, and, perpetual, spouters, the, area, was, formed, by, vigorous, volcanic, activity, the, peculiar, way, of, eruptions, is, an, important, feature, of, these, geysers, most, of, the, geysers, erupt, at, angles, and, only, very, few, have, the, geyser, cones, that, exist, at, many, other, of, the, world, s, geyser, fields, on, june, 3, 2007, a, massive, mudflow, influenced, two, thirds, of, the, valley, it, was, then, reported, that, a, thermal, lake, was, forming, above, the, valley, a, few, days, later, the, water, was, observed, to, have, receded, somewhat, exposing, some, of, the, submerged, features, velikan, geyser, one, of, the, field, s, largest, was, not, buried, in, the, slide, and, has, recently, been, observed, to, be, active, the, name, el, tatio, comes, from, the, quechua, word, for, oven, el, tatio, is, located, in, the, high, valleys, of, the, andes, in, chile, surrounded, by, many, active, volcanoes, at, around, 4, 200, metres, 13, 800, ft, above, mean, sea, level, the, valley, is, home, to, approximately, 80, geysers, at, present, it, became, the, largest, geyser, field, in, the, southern, hemisphere, after, the, destruction, of, many, of, the, new, zealand, geysers, and, is, the, third, largest, geyser, field, in, the, world, the, salient, feature, of, these, geysers, is, that, the, height, of, their, eruptions, is, very, low, the, tallest, being, only, six, metres, 20, ft, high, but, with, steam, columns, that, can, be, over, 20, metres, 66, ft, high, the, average, geyser, eruption, height, at, el, tatio, is, about, 750, millimetres, 30, in, the, taup, volcanic, zone, is, located, on, new, zealand, s, north, island, it, is, 350, kilometres, 217, mi, long, by, 50, km, wide, 31, mi, and, lies, over, a, subduction, zone, in, the, earth, s, crust, mount, ruapehu, marks, its, southwestern, end, while, the, submarine, whakat, ne, seamount, 85, km, or, 53, mi, beyond, whakaari, white, island, is, considered, its, northeastern, limit, many, geysers, in, this, zone, were, destroyed, due, to, geothermal, developments, and, a, hydroelectric, reservoir, but, several, dozen, geysers, still, exist, in, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, the, largest, geyser, ever, known, the, waimangu, geyser, existed, in, this, zone, it, began, erupting, in, 1900, and, erupted, periodically, for, four, years, until, a, landslide, changed, the, local, water, table, eruptions, of, waimangu, would, typically, reach, 160, metres, 520, ft, and, some, superbursts, are, known, to, have, reached, 500, metres, 1, 600, ft, recent, scientific, work, indicates, that, the, earth, s, crust, below, the, zone, may, be, as, little, as, five, kilometres, 3, mi, thick, beneath, this, lies, a, film, of, magma, 50, kilometres, 30, mi, wide, and, 160, kilometres, 100, mi, long, due, to, the, high, rate, of, volcanic, activity, in, iceland, it, is, home, to, some, of, the, most, famous, geysers, in, the, world, there, are, around, 20, 29, active, geysers, in, the, country, as, well, as, numerous, formerly, active, geysers, icelandic, geysers, are, distributed, in, the, zone, stretching, from, south, west, to, north, east, along, the, boundary, between, the, eurasian, plate, and, the, north, american, plate, most, of, the, icelandic, geysers, are, comparatively, short, lived, it, is, also, characteristic, that, many, geysers, here, are, reactivated, or, newly, created, after, earthquakes, becoming, dormant, or, extinct, after, some, years, or, some, decades, two, most, prominent, geysers, of, iceland, are, located, in, haukadalur, the, great, geysir, which, first, erupted, in, the, 14th, century, gave, rise, to, the, word, geyser, by, 1896, geysir, was, almost, dormant, before, an, earthquake, that, year, caused, eruptions, to, begin, again, occurring, several, times, a, day, but, in, 1916, eruptions, all, but, ceased, throughout, much, of, the, 20th, century, eruptions, did, happen, from, time, to, time, usually, following, earthquakes, some, man, made, improvements, were, made, to, the, spring, and, eruptions, were, forced, with, soap, on, special, occasions, earthquakes, in, june, 2000, subsequently, reawakened, the, giant, for, a, time, but, it, is, not, currently, erupting, regularly, the, nearby, strokkur, geyser, erupts, every, 5, 8, minutes, to, a, height, of, some, 30, metres, 100, ft, geysers, are, known, to, have, existed, in, at, least, a, dozen, other, areas, on, the, island, some, former, geysers, have, developed, historical, farms, which, have, benefited, from, the, use, of, the, hot, water, since, medieval, times, there, used, to, be, two, large, geyser, fields, in, nevada, beowawe, and, steamboat, springs, but, they, were, destroyed, by, the, installation, of, nearby, geothermal, power, plants, at, the, plants, geothermal, drilling, reduced, the, available, heat, and, lowered, the, local, water, table, to, the, point, that, geyser, activity, could, no, longer, be, sustained, many, of, new, zealand, s, geysers, have, been, destroyed, by, humans, in, the, last, century, several, new, zealand, geysers, have, also, become, dormant, or, extinct, by, natural, means, the, main, remaining, field, is, whakarewarewa, at, rotorua, two, thirds, of, the, geysers, at, orakei, korako, were, flooded, by, the, construction, of, the, hydroelectric, ohakuri, dam, in, 1961, the, wairakei, field, was, lost, to, a, geothermal, power, plant, in, 1958, the, rotomahana, field, was, destroyed, by, the, 1886, eruption, of, mount, tarawera, there, are, various, other, types, of, geysers, which, are, different, in, nature, compared, to, the, normal, steam, driven, geysers, these, geysers, differ, not, only, in, their, style, of, eruption, but, also, in, the, cause, that, makes, them, erupt, in, a, number, of, places, where, there, is, geothermal, activity, wells, have, been, drilled, and, fitted, with, impermeable, casements, that, allow, them, to, erupt, like, geysers, the, vents, of, such, geysers, are, artificial, but, are, tapped, into, natural, hydrothermal, systems, these, so, called, artificial, geysers, technically, known, as, erupting, geothermal, wells, are, not, true, geysers, little, old, faithful, geyser, in, calistoga, california, is, an, example, the, geyser, erupts, from, the, casing, of, a, well, drilled, in, the, late, 19th, century, according, to, dr, john, rinehart, in, his, book, a, guide, to, geyser, gazing, 1976, p, 49, a, man, had, drilled, into, the, geyser, in, search, for, water, he, had, simply, opened, up, a, dead, geyser, in, the, case, of, the, big, mine, run, geyser, in, ashland, pennsylvania, the, heat, powering, the, geyser, which, erupts, from, an, abandoned, mine, vent, comes, not, from, geothermal, power, but, from, the, long, simmering, centralia, mine, fire, this, is, a, natural, hot, spring, that, spouts, water, constantly, without, stopping, for, recharge, some, of, these, are, incorrectly, called, geysers, but, because, they, are, not, periodic, in, nature, they, are, not, considered, true, geysers, geysers, are, used, for, various, activities, such, as, electricity, generation, heating, and, tourism, many, geothermal, reserves, are, found, all, around, the, world, the, geyser, fields, in, iceland, are, some, of, the, most, commercially, viable, geyser, locations, in, the, world, since, the, 1920s, hot, water, directed, from, the, geysers, has, been, used, to, heat, greenhouses, and, to, grow, food, that, otherwise, could, not, have, been, cultivated, in, iceland, s, inhospitable, climate, steam, and, hot, water, from, the, geysers, has, also, been, used, for, heating, homes, since, 1943, in, iceland, in, 1979, the, u, s, department, of, energy, doe, actively, promoted, development, of, geothermal, energy, in, the, geysers, calistoga, known, geothermal, resource, area, kgra, near, calistoga, california, through, a, variety, of, research, programs, and, the, geothermal, loan, guarantee, program, the, department, is, obligated, by, law, to, assess, the, potential, environmental, impacts, of, geothermal, development, there, are, many, bodies, in, the, solar, system, where, eruptions, which, superficially, resemble, terrestrial, geysers, have, been, observed, or, are, believed, to, occur, despite, being, commonly, referred, to, as, geysers, they, are, driven, by, fundamentally, different, processes, consist, of, a, wide, range, of, volatiles, and, can, occur, on, vastly, disparate, scales, from, the, modestly, sized, martian, carbon, dioxide, jets, to, the, immense, plumes, of, enceladus, generally, there, are, two, broad, categories, of, feature, commonly, referred, to, as, geysers, sublimation, plumes, and, cryovolcanic, plumes, also, referred, to, as, cryogeysers, sublimation, plumes, are, jets, of, sublimated, volatiles, and, dust, from, shallow, sources, under, icy, surfaces, known, examples, include, the, co, 2, jets, on, mars, and, the, nitrogen, eruptions, on, neptune, s, moon, triton, on, mars, carbon, dioxide, jets, are, believed, to, occur, in, the, southern, polar, region, of, mars, during, spring, as, a, layer, of, dry, ice, accumulated, over, winter, is, warmed, by, the, sun, although, these, jets, have, not, yet, been, directly, observed, they, leave, evidence, visible, from, orbit, in, the, form, of, dark, spots, and, lighter, fans, atop, the, dry, ice, these, features, consist, primarily, of, sand, and, dust, blown, out, by, the, outbursts, as, well, as, spider, like, patterns, of, channels, created, below, the, ice, by, the, rapid, flow, of, co, 2, gas, there, are, a, plethora, of, theories, to, explain, the, eruptions, including, heating, from, sunlight, chemical, reactions, or, even, biological, activity, triton, was, found, to, have, active, eruptions, of, nitrogen, and, dust, by, voyager, 2, when, it, flew, past, the, moon, in, 1989, these, plumes, were, up, to, 8, km, high, where, winds, would, blow, them, up, to, 150, km, downwind, creating, long, dark, streaks, across, the, otherwise, bright, south, polar, ice, cap, there, are, various, theories, as, to, what, drives, the, activity, on, triton, such, as, solar, heating, through, transparent, ice, cryovolcanism, or, basal, heating, of, nitrogen, ice, sheets, cryovolcanic, plumes, or, cryogeysers, generally, refer, to, large, scale, eruptions, of, predominantly, water, vapour, from, active, cryovolcanic, features, on, certain, icy, moons, such, plumes, occur, on, saturn, s, moon, enceladus, and, jupiter, s, moon, europa, plumes, of, water, vapour, together, with, ice, particles, and, smaller, amounts, of, other, components, such, as, carbon, dioxide, nitrogen, ammonia, hydrocarbons, and, silicates, have, been, observed, erupting, from, vents, associated, with, the, tiger, stripes, in, the, south, polar, region, of, enceladus, by, the, cassini, orbiter, these, plumes, are, the, source, of, the, material, in, saturn, s, e, ring, the, mechanism, which, causes, these, eruptions, are, generated, remains, uncertain, as, well, as, to, what, extent, they, are, physically, linked, to, enceladus, subsurface, ocean, but, they, are, believed, to, be, powered, at, least, in, part, by, tidal, heating, cassini, flew, through, these, plumes, several, times, allowing, direct, analysis, of, water, from, inside, another, solar, system, body, for, the, first, time, in, december, 2013, the, hubble, space, telescope, detected, water, vapor, plumes, potentially, 200, km, high, above, the, south, polar, region, of, europa, re, examination, of, galileo, data, also, suggested, that, it, may, have, flown, through, a, plume, during, a, flyby, in, 1997, water, was, also, detected, by, the, keck, observatory, in, 2016, announced, in, a, 2019, nature, article, speculating, the, cause, to, be, a, cryovolcanic, eruption, it, is, thought, that, europa, s, lineae, might, be, venting, this, water, vapor, into, space, in, a, similar, manner, to, the, tiger, stripes, of, enceladus
