karst, k, r, s, t, is, a, topography, formed, from, the, dissolution, of, soluble, carbonate, rocks, such, as, limestone, and, dolomite, it, is, characterized, by, features, like, poljes, above, and, drainage, systems, with, sinkholes, and, caves, underground, there, is, some, evidence, that, karst, may, occur, in, more, weathering, resistant, rocks, such, as, quartzite, given, the, right, conditions, subterranean, drainage, may, limit, surface, water, with, few, to, no, rivers, or, lakes, in, regions, where, the, dissolved, bedrock, is, covered, perhaps, by, debris, or, confined, by, one, or, more, superimposed, non, soluble, rock, strata, distinctive, karst, features, may, occur, only, at, subsurface, levels, and, can, be, totally, missing, above, ground, the, study, of, paleokarst, buried, karst, in, the, stratigraphic, column, is, important, in, petroleum, geology, because, as, much, as, 50, of, the, world, s, hydrocarbon, reserves, are, hosted, in, carbonate, rock, and, much, of, this, is, found, in, porous, karst, systems, the, english, word, karst, was, borrowed, from, german, karst, in, the, late, 19th, century, which, entered, german, usage, much, earlier, to, describe, a, number, of, geological, geomorphological, and, hydrological, features, found, within, the, range, of, the, dinaric, alps, stretching, from, the, northeastern, corner, of, italy, above, the, city, of, trieste, across, the, balkan, peninsula, along, the, coast, of, the, eastern, adriatic, to, kosovo, and, north, macedonia, where, the, massif, of, the, ar, mountains, begins, the, karst, zone, is, at, the, northwesternmost, section, described, in, early, topographical, research, as, a, plateau, between, italy, and, slovenia, languages, preserving, this, form, include, italian, carso, german, karst, and, albanian, karsti, in, the, local, south, slavic, languages, all, variations, of, the, word, are, derived, from, a, romanized, illyrian, base, yielding, latin, carsus, dalmatian, carsus, later, metathesized, from, the, reconstructed, form, kors, into, forms, such, as, slovene, kras, and, serbo, croatian, kr, kras, first, attested, in, the, 18th, century, and, the, adjective, form, kra, ki, in, the, 16th, century, as, a, proper, noun, the, slovene, form, grast, was, first, attested, in, 1177, ultimately, the, word, is, of, mediterranean, origin, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, the, word, may, derive, from, the, proto, indo, european, root, karra, rock, the, name, may, also, be, connected, to, the, oronym, kar, u, s, dios, oros, cited, by, ptolemy, and, perhaps, also, to, latin, carusardius, johann, weikhard, von, valvasor, a, pioneer, of, the, study, of, karst, in, slovenia, and, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, london, introduced, the, word, karst, to, european, scholars, in, 1689, to, describe, the, phenomenon, of, underground, flows, of, rivers, in, his, account, of, lake, cerknica, jovan, cviji, greatly, advanced, the, knowledge, of, karst, regions, to, the, point, where, he, became, known, as, the, father, of, karst, geomorphology, primarily, discussing, the, karst, regions, of, the, balkans, cviji, s, 1893, publication, das, karstph, nomen, describes, landforms, such, as, karren, dolines, and, poljes, in, a, 1918, publication, cviji, proposed, a, cyclical, model, for, karst, landscape, development, karst, hydrology, emerged, as, a, discipline, in, the, late, 1950s, and, the, early, 1960s, in, france, previously, the, activities, of, cave, explorers, called, speleologists, had, been, dismissed, as, more, of, a, sport, than, a, science, and, so, the, underground, karst, caves, and, their, associated, watercourses, were, from, a, scientific, perspective, understudied, karst, is, most, strongly, developed, in, dense, carbonate, rock, such, as, limestone, that, is, thinly, bedded, and, highly, fractured, karst, is, not, typically, well, developed, in, chalk, because, chalk, is, highly, porous, rather, than, dense, so, the, flow, of, groundwater, is, not, concentrated, along, fractures, karst, is, also, most, strongly, developed, where, the, water, table, is, relatively, low, such, as, in, uplands, with, entrenched, valleys, and, where, rainfall, is, moderate, to, heavy, this, contributes, to, rapid, downward, movement, of, groundwater, which, promotes, dissolution, of, the, bedrock, whereas, standing, groundwater, becomes, saturated, with, carbonate, minerals, and, ceases, to, dissolve, the, bedrock, the, carbonic, acid, that, causes, karst, features, is, formed, as, rain, passes, through, earth, s, atmosphere, picking, up, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, which, readily, dissolves, in, the, water, once, the, rain, reaches, the, ground, it, may, pass, through, soil, that, provides, additional, co, 2, produced, by, soil, respiration, some, of, the, dissolved, carbon, dioxide, reacts, with, the, water, to, form, a, weak, carbonic, acid, solution, which, dissolves, calcium, carbonate, the, primary, reaction, sequence, in, limestone, dissolution, is, the, following, in, very, rare, conditions, oxidation, can, play, a, role, oxidation, played, a, major, role, in, the, formation, of, ancient, lechuguilla, cave, in, the, us, state, of, new, mexico, and, is, presently, active, in, the, frasassi, caves, of, italy, the, oxidation, of, sulfides, leading, to, the, formation, of, sulfuric, acid, can, also, be, one, of, the, corrosion, factors, in, karst, formation, as, oxygen, o, 2, rich, surface, waters, seep, into, deep, anoxic, karst, systems, they, bring, oxygen, which, reacts, with, sulfide, present, in, the, system, pyrite, or, hydrogen, sulfide, to, form, sulfuric, acid, h, 2, so, 4, sulfuric, acid, then, reacts, with, calcium, carbonate, causing, increased, erosion, within, the, limestone, formation, this, chain, of, reactions, is, this, reaction, chain, forms, gypsum, the, karstification, of, a, landscape, may, result, in, a, variety, of, large, or, small, scale, features, both, on, the, surface, and, beneath, on, exposed, surfaces, small, features, may, include, solution, flutes, or, rillenkarren, runnels, limestone, pavement, clints, and, grikes, kamenitzas, collectively, called, karren, or, lapiez, medium, sized, surface, features, may, include, sinkholes, or, cenotes, closed, basins, vertical, shafts, foibe, inverted, funnel, shaped, sinkholes, disappearing, streams, and, reappearing, springs, large, scale, features, may, include, limestone, pavements, poljes, and, karst, valleys, mature, karst, landscapes, where, more, bedrock, has, been, removed, than, remains, may, result, in, karst, towers, or, haystack, eggbox, landscapes, beneath, the, surface, complex, underground, drainage, systems, such, as, karst, aquifers, and, extensive, caves, and, cavern, systems, may, form, erosion, along, limestone, shores, notably, in, the, tropics, produces, karst, topography, that, includes, a, sharp, makatea, surface, above, the, normal, reach, of, the, sea, and, undercuts, that, are, mostly, the, result, of, biological, activity, or, bioerosion, at, or, a, little, above, mean, sea, level, some, of, the, most, dramatic, of, these, formations, can, be, seen, in, thailand, s, phangnga, bay, and, at, halong, bay, in, vietnam, calcium, carbonate, dissolved, into, water, may, precipitate, out, where, the, water, discharges, some, of, its, dissolved, carbon, dioxide, rivers, which, emerge, from, springs, may, produce, tufa, terraces, consisting, of, layers, of, calcite, deposited, over, extended, periods, of, time, in, caves, a, variety, of, features, collectively, called, speleothems, are, formed, by, deposition, of, calcium, carbonate, and, other, dissolved, minerals, interstratal, karst, is, a, karst, landscape, which, is, developed, beneath, a, cover, of, insoluble, rocks, typically, this, will, involve, a, cover, of, sandstone, overlying, limestone, strata, undergoing, solution, in, the, united, kingdom, for, example, extensive, doline, fields, have, developed, at, cefn, yr, ystrad, mynydd, llangatwg, and, mynydd, llangynidr, in, south, wales, across, a, cover, of, twrch, sandstone, which, overlies, concealed, carboniferous, limestone, the, last, named, locality, having, been, declared, a, site, of, special, scientific, interest, in, respect, of, it, kegelkarst, is, a, type, of, tropical, karst, terrain, with, numerous, cone, like, hills, formed, by, cockpits, mogotes, and, poljes, and, without, strong, fluvial, erosion, processes, this, terrain, is, found, in, cuba, jamaica, indonesia, malaysia, the, philippines, puerto, rico, southern, china, myanmar, thailand, laos, and, vietnam, salt, karst, or, halite, karst, is, developed, in, areas, where, salt, is, undergoing, solution, underground, it, can, lead, to, surface, depressions, and, collapses, which, present, a, geo, hazard, karst, areas, tend, to, have, unique, types, of, forests, the, karst, terrain, is, difficult, for, humans, to, traverse, so, that, their, ecosystems, are, often, relatively, undisturbed, the, soil, tends, to, have, a, high, ph, which, encourages, growth, of, unusual, species, of, orchids, palms, mangroves, and, other, plants, paleokarst, or, palaeokarst, is, a, development, of, karst, observed, in, geological, history, and, preserved, within, the, rock, sequence, effectively, a, fossil, karst, there, are, for, example, palaeokarst, surfaces, exposed, within, the, clydach, valley, subgroup, of, the, carboniferous, limestone, sequence, of, south, wales, which, developed, as, sub, aerial, weathering, of, recently, formed, limestones, took, place, during, periods, of, non, deposition, within, the, early, part, of, the, period, sedimentation, resumed, and, further, limestone, strata, were, deposited, on, an, irregular, karst, surface, the, cycle, recurring, several, times, in, connection, with, fluctuating, sea, levels, over, prolonged, periods, pseudokarsts, are, similar, in, form, or, appearance, to, karst, features, but, are, created, by, different, mechanisms, examples, include, lava, caves, and, granite, tors, for, example, labertouche, cave, in, victoria, australia, and, paleocollapse, features, mud, caves, are, an, example, of, pseudokarst, karst, formations, have, unique, hydrology, resulting, in, many, unusual, features, a, karst, fenster, karst, window, occurs, when, an, underground, stream, emerges, onto, the, surface, between, layers, of, rock, cascades, some, distance, and, then, disappears, back, down, often, into, a, sinkhole, rivers, in, karst, areas, may, disappear, underground, a, number, of, times, and, spring, up, again, in, different, places, even, under, a, different, name, like, ljubljanica, the, river, of, seven, names, another, example, of, this, is, the, popo, agie, river, in, fremont, county, wyoming, where, at, a, site, named, the, sinks, in, sinks, canyon, state, park, the, river, flows, into, a, cave, in, a, formation, known, as, the, madison, limestone, and, then, rises, again, 800, m, 1, 2, mi, down, the, canyon, in, a, placid, pool, a, turlough, is, a, unique, type, of, seasonal, lake, found, in, irish, karst, areas, which, are, formed, through, the, annual, welling, up, of, water, from, the, underground, water, system, main, article, aquifer, karst, karst, aquifers, typically, develop, in, limestone, surface, water, containing, natural, carbonic, acid, moves, down, into, small, fissures, in, limestone, this, carbonic, acid, gradually, dissolves, limestone, thereby, enlarging, the, fissures, the, enlarged, fissures, allow, a, larger, quantity, of, water, to, enter, which, leads, to, a, progressive, enlargement, of, openings, abundant, small, openings, store, a, large, quantity, of, water, the, larger, openings, form, a, conduit, system, that, drains, the, aquifer, to, springs, characterization, of, karst, aquifers, requires, field, exploration, to, locate, sinkholes, swallets, sinking, streams, and, springs, in, addition, to, studying, geologic, maps, 4, conventional, hydrogeologic, methods, such, as, aquifer, tests, and, potentiometric, mapping, are, insufficient, to, characterize, the, complexity, of, karst, aquifers, and, need, to, be, supplemented, with, dye, traces, measurement, of, spring, discharges, and, analysis, of, water, chemistry, u, s, geological, survey, dye, tracing, has, determined, that, conventional, groundwater, models, that, assume, a, uniform, distribution, of, porosity, are, not, applicable, for, karst, aquifers, linear, alignment, of, surface, features, such, as, straight, stream, segments, and, sinkholes, develop, along, fracture, traces, locating, a, well, in, a, fracture, trace, or, intersection, of, fracture, traces, increases, the, likelihood, to, encounter, good, water, production, voids, in, karst, aquifers, can, be, large, enough, to, cause, destructive, collapse, or, subsidence, of, the, ground, surface, that, can, initiate, a, catastrophic, release, of, contaminants, 3, 4, groundwater, flow, rate, in, karst, aquifers, is, much, more, rapid, than, in, porous, aquifers, for, example, in, the, barton, springs, edwards, aquifer, dye, traces, measured, the, karst, groundwater, flow, rates, from, 0, 5, to, 7, miles, per, day, 0, 8, to, 11, 3, km, d, the, rapid, groundwater, flow, rates, make, karst, aquifers, much, more, sensitive, to, groundwater, contamination, than, porous, aquifers, 1, groundwater, in, karst, areas, is, also, just, as, easily, polluted, as, surface, streams, because, karst, formations, are, cavernous, and, highly, permeable, resulting, in, reduced, opportunity, for, contaminant, filtration, well, water, may, also, be, unsafe, as, the, water, may, have, run, unimpeded, from, a, sinkhole, in, a, cattle, pasture, bypassing, the, normal, filtering, that, occurs, in, a, porous, aquifer, sinkholes, have, often, been, used, as, farmstead, or, community, trash, dumps, overloaded, or, malfunctioning, septic, tanks, in, karst, landscapes, may, dump, raw, sewage, directly, into, underground, channels, geologists, are, concerned, with, these, negative, effects, of, human, activity, on, karst, hydrology, which, as, of, 2007, supplied, about, 25, of, the, global, demand, for, drinkable, water, farming, in, karst, areas, must, take, into, account, the, lack, of, surface, water, the, soils, may, be, fertile, enough, and, rainfall, may, be, adequate, but, rainwater, quickly, moves, through, the, crevices, into, the, ground, sometimes, leaving, the, surface, soil, parched, between, rains, the, karst, topography, also, poses, peculiar, difficulties, for, human, inhabitants, sinkholes, can, develop, gradually, as, surface, openings, enlarge, but, progressive, erosion, is, frequently, unseen, until, the, roof, of, a, cavern, suddenly, collapses, such, events, have, swallowed, homes, cattle, cars, and, farm, machinery, in, the, united, states, sudden, collapse, of, such, a, cavern, sinkhole, swallowed, part, of, the, collection, of, the, national, corvette, museum, in, bowling, green, kentucky, in, 2014, the, world, s, largest, limestone, karst, is, australia, s, nullarbor, plain, slovenia, has, the, world, s, highest, risk, of, sinkholes, while, the, western, highland, rim, in, the, eastern, united, states, is, at, the, second, highest, risk, of, karst, sinkholes, in, canada, wood, buffalo, national, park, northwest, territories, contains, areas, of, karst, sinkholes, mexico, hosts, important, karst, regions, in, the, yucat,
