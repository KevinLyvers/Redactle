sodium, bicarbonate, iupac, name, sodium, hydrogencarbonate, commonly, known, as, baking, soda, or, bicarbonate, of, soda, is, a, chemical, compound, with, the, formula, nahco, 3, it, is, a, salt, composed, of, a, sodium, cation, na, and, a, bicarbonate, anion, hco, 3, sodium, bicarbonate, is, a, white, solid, that, is, crystalline, but, often, appears, as, a, fine, powder, it, has, a, slightly, salty, alkaline, taste, resembling, that, of, washing, soda, sodium, carbonate, the, natural, mineral, form, is, nahcolite, although, it, is, more, commonly, found, as, a, component, of, the, mineral, trona, because, it, has, long, been, known, and, widely, used, the, salt, has, many, different, names, such, as, baking, soda, bread, soda, cooking, soda, brewing, soda, and, bicarbonate, of, soda, and, can, often, be, found, near, baking, powder, in, stores, the, term, baking, soda, is, more, common, in, the, united, states, while, bicarbonate, of, soda, is, more, common, in, australia, the, united, kingdom, and, new, zealand, abbreviated, colloquial, forms, such, as, sodium, bicarb, bicarb, soda, bicarbonate, and, bicarb, are, common, the, prefix, bi, in, bicarbonate, comes, from, an, outdated, naming, system, predating, molecular, knowledge, it, is, based, on, the, observation, that, there, is, twice, as, much, carbonate, co, 3, 2, per, sodium, in, sodium, bicarbonate, nahco, 3, as, there, is, in, sodium, carbonate, na, 2, co, 3, the, modern, chemical, formulas, of, these, compounds, now, express, their, precise, chemical, compositions, which, were, unknown, when, the, name, bi, carbonate, of, potash, was, coined, see, also, bicarbonate, in, cooking, baking, soda, is, primarily, used, in, baking, as, a, leavening, agent, when, it, reacts, with, acid, or, is, heated, carbon, dioxide, is, released, which, causes, expansion, of, the, batter, and, forms, the, characteristic, texture, and, grain, in, cakes, quick, breads, soda, bread, and, other, baked, and, fried, foods, when, an, acid, is, used, the, acid, base, reaction, can, be, generically, represented, as, follows, acidic, materials, that, induce, this, reaction, include, hydrogen, phosphates, cream, of, tartar, lemon, juice, yogurt, buttermilk, cocoa, and, vinegar, baking, soda, may, be, used, together, with, sourdough, which, is, acidic, making, a, lighter, product, with, a, less, acidic, taste, since, the, reaction, occurs, slowly, at, room, temperature, mixtures, cake, batter, etc, can, be, allowed, to, stand, without, rising, until, they, are, heated, in, the, oven, heat, can, also, by, itself, cause, sodium, bicarbonate, to, act, as, a, raising, agent, in, baking, because, of, thermal, decomposition, releasing, carbon, dioxide, at, temperatures, above, 80, c, 180, f, as, follows, when, used, this, way, on, its, own, without, the, presence, of, an, acidic, component, whether, in, the, batter, or, by, the, use, of, a, baking, powder, containing, acid, only, half, the, available, co, 2, is, released, one, co, 2, molecule, is, formed, for, every, two, equivalents, of, nahco, 3, additionally, in, the, absence, of, acid, thermal, decomposition, of, sodium, bicarbonate, also, produces, sodium, carbonate, which, is, strongly, alkaline, and, gives, the, baked, product, a, bitter, soapy, taste, and, a, yellow, color, baking, powder, also, sold, for, cooking, contains, around, 30, of, bicarbonate, and, various, acidic, ingredients, that, are, activated, by, the, addition, of, water, without, the, need, for, additional, acids, in, the, cooking, medium, many, forms, of, baking, powder, contain, sodium, bicarbonate, combined, with, calcium, acid, phosphate, sodium, aluminium, phosphate, or, cream, of, tartar, baking, soda, is, alkaline, the, acid, used, in, baking, powder, avoids, a, metallic, taste, when, the, chemical, change, during, baking, creates, sodium, carbonate, it, is, often, used, in, conjunction, with, other, bottled, water, food, additives, to, add, taste, its, european, union, e, number, is, e500, sodium, bicarbonate, is, one, of, the, main, components, of, the, common, black, snake, firework, the, effect, is, caused, by, the, thermal, decomposition, which, produces, carbon, dioxide, gas, to, produce, a, long, snake, like, ash, as, a, combustion, product, of, the, other, main, component, sucrose, sodium, bicarbonate, also, delays, combustion, reactions, through, the, release, of, carbon, dioxide, and, water, both, of, which, are, flame, retardants, when, heated, it, has, weak, disinfectant, properties, and, it, may, be, an, effective, fungicide, against, some, organisms, because, baking, soda, will, absorb, musty, smells, it, has, become, a, reliable, method, for, used, booksellers, when, making, books, less, malodorous, sodium, bicarbonate, can, be, used, to, extinguish, small, grease, or, electrical, fires, by, being, thrown, over, the, fire, as, heating, of, sodium, bicarbonate, releases, carbon, dioxide, however, it, should, not, be, applied, to, fires, in, deep, fryers, the, sudden, release, of, gas, may, cause, the, grease, to, splatter, sodium, bicarbonate, is, used, in, bc, dry, chemical, fire, extinguishers, as, an, alternative, to, the, more, corrosive, monoammonium, phosphate, in, abc, extinguishers, the, alkaline, nature, of, sodium, bicarbonate, makes, it, the, only, dry, chemical, agent, besides, purple, k, that, was, used, in, large, scale, fire, suppression, systems, installed, in, commercial, kitchens, sodium, bicarbonate, has, several, fire, extinguishing, mechanisms, that, act, simultaneously, it, decomposes, into, water, and, carbon, dioxide, when, heated, an, endothermic, reaction, that, deprives, the, fire, of, heat, in, addition, it, forms, intermediates, that, can, scavenge, the, free, radicals, which, are, responsible, for, the, propagation, of, fire, with, grease, fires, specifically, it, also, has, a, mild, saponification, effect, producing, a, soapy, foam, that, can, help, smother, the, fire, sodium, bicarbonate, reacts, spontaneously, with, acids, releasing, co, 2, gas, as, a, reaction, product, it, is, commonly, used, to, neutralize, unwanted, acid, solutions, or, acid, spills, in, chemical, laboratories, it, is, not, appropriate, to, use, sodium, bicarbonate, to, neutralize, base, even, though, it, is, amphoteric, reacting, with, both, acids, and, bases, sodium, bicarbonate, is, taken, as, a, sports, supplement, to, improve, muscular, endurance, studies, conducted, mostly, in, males, have, shown, that, sodium, bicarbonate, is, most, effective, in, enhancing, performance, in, short, term, high, intensity, activities, sodium, bicarbonate, can, prevent, the, growth, of, fungi, when, applied, on, leaves, although, it, will, not, kill, the, fungus, excessive, amounts, of, sodium, bicarbonate, can, cause, discolouration, of, fruits, two, percent, solution, and, chlorosis, one, percent, solution, sodium, bicarbonate, mixed, with, water, can, be, used, as, an, antacid, to, treat, acid, indigestion, and, heartburn, its, reaction, with, stomach, acid, produces, salt, water, and, carbon, dioxide, a, mixture, of, sodium, bicarbonate, and, polyethylene, glycol, such, as, peglyte, dissolved, in, water, and, taken, orally, is, an, effective, gastrointestinal, lavage, preparation, and, laxative, prior, to, gastrointestinal, surgery, gastroscopy, etc, intravenous, sodium, bicarbonate, in, an, aqueous, solution, is, sometimes, used, for, cases, of, acidosis, or, when, insufficient, sodium, or, bicarbonate, ions, are, in, the, blood, in, cases, of, respiratory, acidosis, the, infused, bicarbonate, ion, drives, the, carbonic, acid, bicarbonate, buffer, of, plasma, to, the, left, and, thus, raises, the, ph, for, this, reason, sodium, bicarbonate, is, used, in, medically, supervised, cardiopulmonary, resuscitation, infusion, of, bicarbonate, is, indicated, only, when, the, blood, ph, is, markedly, low, 7, 1, 7, 0, hco, 3, is, used, for, treatment, of, hyperkalemia, as, it, will, drive, k, back, into, cells, during, periods, of, acidosis, since, sodium, bicarbonate, can, cause, alkalosis, it, is, sometimes, used, to, treat, aspirin, overdoses, aspirin, requires, an, acidic, environment, for, proper, absorption, and, a, basic, environment, will, diminish, aspirin, absorption, in, cases, of, overdose, sodium, bicarbonate, has, also, been, used, in, the, treatment, of, tricyclic, antidepressant, overdose, it, can, also, be, applied, topically, as, a, paste, with, three, parts, baking, soda, to, one, part, water, to, relieve, some, kinds, of, insect, bites, and, stings, as, well, as, accompanying, swelling, some, alternative, practitioners, such, as, tullio, simoncini, have, promoted, baking, soda, as, a, cancer, cure, which, the, american, cancer, society, has, warned, against, due, to, both, its, unproven, effectiveness, and, potential, danger, in, use, edzard, ernst, has, called, the, promotion, of, sodium, bicarbonate, as, a, cancer, cure, one, of, the, more, sickening, alternative, cancer, scams, i, have, seen, for, a, long, time, sodium, bicarbonate, can, be, added, to, local, anaesthetics, to, speed, up, the, onset, of, their, effects, and, make, their, injection, less, painful, it, is, also, a, component, of, moffett, s, solution, used, in, nasal, surgery, it, has, been, proposed, that, acidic, diets, weaken, bones, one, systematic, meta, analysis, of, the, research, shows, no, such, effect, another, also, finds, that, there, is, no, evidence, that, alkaline, diets, improve, bone, health, but, suggests, that, there, may, be, some, value, to, alkaline, diets, for, other, reasons, antacid, such, as, baking, soda, solutions, have, been, prepared, and, used, by, protesters, to, alleviate, the, effects, of, exposure, to, tear, gas, during, protests, similarly, to, its, use, in, baking, sodium, bicarbonate, is, used, together, with, a, mild, acid, such, as, tartaric, acid, as, the, excipient, in, effervescent, tablets, when, such, a, tablet, is, dropped, in, a, glass, of, water, the, carbonate, leaves, the, reaction, medium, as, carbon, dioxide, gas, hco, 3, h, h, 2, o, co, 2, or, more, precisely, hco, 3, h, 3, o, 2, h, 2, o, co, 2, this, makes, the, tablet, disintegrate, leaving, the, medication, suspended, and, or, dissolved, in, the, water, together, with, the, resulting, salt, in, this, example, sodium, tartrate, sodium, bicarbonate, is, also, used, as, an, ingredient, in, some, mouthwashes, it, has, anticaries, and, abrasive, properties, it, works, as, a, mechanical, cleanser, on, the, teeth, and, gums, neutralizes, the, production, of, acid, in, the, mouth, and, also, acts, as, an, antiseptic, to, help, prevent, infections, sodium, bicarbonate, in, combination, with, other, ingredients, can, be, used, to, make, a, dry, or, wet, deodorant, sodium, bicarbonate, may, be, used, as, a, buffering, agent, combined, with, table, salt, when, creating, a, solution, for, nasal, irrigation, it, is, used, in, eye, hygiene, to, treat, blepharitis, this, is, done, by, adding, a, teaspoon, of, sodium, bicarbonate, to, cool, water, that, was, recently, boiled, followed, by, gentle, scrubbing, of, the, eyelash, base, with, a, cotton, swab, dipped, in, the, solution, sodium, bicarbonate, is, used, as, a, cattle, feed, supplement, in, particular, as, a, buffering, agent, for, the, rumen, sodium, bicarbonate, is, used, in, a, process, to, remove, paint, and, corrosion, called, sodablasting, as, a, blasting, medium, sodium, bicarbonate, is, used, to, remove, surface, contamination, from, softer, and, less, resilient, substrates, such, as, aluminium, copper, or, timber, that, could, be, damaged, by, silica, sand, abrasive, media, a, manufacturer, recommends, a, paste, made, from, baking, soda, with, minimal, water, as, a, gentle, scouring, powder, such, a, paste, can, be, useful, in, removing, surface, rust, because, the, rust, forms, a, water, soluble, compound, when, in, a, concentrated, alkaline, solution, cold, water, should, be, used, since, hot, water, solutions, can, corrode, steel, sodium, bicarbonate, attacks, the, thin, protective, oxide, layer, that, forms, on, aluminium, making, it, unsuitable, for, cleaning, this, metal, a, solution, in, warm, water, will, remove, the, tarnish, from, silver, when, the, silver, is, in, contact, with, a, piece, of, aluminium, foil, baking, soda, is, commonly, added, to, washing, machines, as, a, replacement, for, water, softener, and, to, remove, odors, from, clothes, when, diluted, with, warm, water, it, is, also, almost, as, effective, in, removing, heavy, tea, and, coffee, stains, from, cups, as, sodium, hydroxide, during, the, manhattan, project, to, develop, the, nuclear, bomb, in, the, early, 1940s, the, chemical, toxicity, of, uranium, was, an, issue, uranium, oxides, were, found, to, stick, very, well, to, cotton, cloth, and, did, not, wash, out, with, soap, or, laundry, detergent, however, the, uranium, would, wash, out, with, a, 2, solution, of, sodium, bicarbonate, clothing, can, become, contaminated, with, toxic, dust, of, depleted, uranium, du, which, is, very, dense, hence, it, is, used, for, counterweights, in, a, civilian, context, and, in, armour, piercing, projectiles, du, is, not, removed, by, normal, laundering, washing, with, about, 6, ounces, 170, g, of, baking, soda, in, 2, gallons, 7, 5, l, of, water, will, help, wash, it, out, it, is, often, claimed, that, baking, soda, is, an, effective, odor, remover, and, recommended, that, an, open, box, be, kept, in, the, refrigerator, to, absorb, odor, this, idea, was, promoted, by, the, leading, u, s, brand, of, baking, soda, arm, hammer, in, an, advertising, campaign, starting, in, 1972, though, this, campaign, is, considered, a, classic, of, marketing, leading, within, a, year, to, more, than, half, of, american, refrigerators, containing, a, box, of, baking, soda, there, is, little, evidence, that, it, is, effective, in, this, application, sodium, bicarbonate, is, an, amphoteric, compound, aqueous, solutions, are, mildly, alkaline, due, to, the, formation, of, carbonic, acid, and, hydroxide, ion, sodium, bicarbonate, can, sometimes, be, used, as, a, mild, neutralization, agent, and, a, safer, alternative, to, strong, bases, like, sodium, hydroxide, reaction, of, sodium, bicarbonate, and, an, acid, produces, a, salt, and, carbonic, acid, which, readily, decomposes, to, carbon, dioxide, and, water, sodium, bicarbonate, reacts, with, acetic, acid, found, in, vinegar, producing, sodium, acetate, water, and, carbon, dioxide, sodium, bicarbonate, reacts, with, bases, such, as, sodium, hydroxide, to, form, carbonates, at, temperatures, from, 80, 100, c, 176, 212, f, sodium, bicarbonate, gradually, decomposes, into, sodium, carbonate, water, and, carbon, dioxide, the, conversion, is, faster, at, 200, c, 392, f, most, bicarbonates, undergo, this, dehydration, reaction, further, heating, converts, the, carbonate, into, the, oxide, above, 850, c, 1, 560, f, the, generation, of, carbon, dioxide, and, water, partially, explain, the, fire, extinguishing, properties, of, nahco, 3, although, other, factors, like, heat, absorption, and, radical, scavenging, are, more, significant, in, nature, sodium, bicarbonate, occurs, almost, exclusively, as, either, nahcolite, or, trona, trona, is, more, common, as, nahcolite, is, more, soluble, in, water, and, the, chemical, equilibrium, between, the, two, minerals, favors, trona, significant, nahcolite, deposits, are, in, the, united, states, botswana, and, kenya, uganda, turkey, and, mexico, the, biggest, trona, deposits, are, in, the, green, river, basin, in, wyoming, nahcolite, is, sometimes, found, as, a, component, of, oil, shale, if, kept, cool, room, temperature, and, dry, an, airtight, container, is, recommended, to, keep, out, moist, air, sodium, bicarbonate, can, be, kept, without, a, significant, amount, of, decomposition, for, at, least, two, or, three, years, the, word, natron, has, been, in, use, in, many, languages, throughout, modern, times, in, the, forms, of, anatron, natrum, and, natron, and, originated, like, spanish, french, and, english, natron, as, well, as, sodium, via, arabic, na, r, n, or, anatr, n, cf, the, lower, egyptian, natrontal, wadi, el, natrun, where, a, mixture, of, sodium, carbonate, and, sodium, hydrogen, carbonate, for, the, dehydration, of, mummies, was, used, from, greek, n, tron, herodotus, attic, l, tron, which, can, be, traced, back, to, ancient, egyptian, ntr, the, greek, n, tron, soda, saltpeter, was, also, used, in, latin, sal, nitrum, and, in, german, salniter, the, source, of, nitrogen, nitrat, etc, the, word, saleratus, from, latin, sal, ratus, meaning, aerated, salt, was, widely, used, in, the, 19th, century, for, both, sodium, bicarbonate, and, potassium, bicarbonate, in, 1791, french, chemist, nicolas, leblanc, produced, sodium, carbonate, also, known, as, soda, ash, pharmacist, valentin, rose, the, younger, is, credited, with, the, discovery, of, sodium, bicarbonate, in, 1801, in, berlin, in, 1846, two, american, bakers, john, dwight, and, austin, church, established, the, first, factory, in, the, united, states, to, produce, baking, soda, from, sodium, carbonate, and, carbon, dioxide, saleratus, potassium, or, sodium, bicarbonate, is, mentioned, in, the, novel, captains, courageous, by, rudyard, kipling, as, being, used, extensively, in, the, 1800s, in, commercial, fishing, to, prevent, freshly, caught, fish, from, spoiling, in, 1919, us, senator, lee, overman, declared, that, bicarbonate, of, soda, could, cure, the, spanish, flu, in, the, midst, of, the, debate, on, 26, january, 1919, he, interrupted, the, discussion, to, announce, the, discovery, of, a, cure, i, want, to, say, for, the, benefit, of, those, who, are, making, this, investigation, he, reported, that, i, was, told, by, a, judge, of, a, superior, court, in, the, mountain, country, of, north, carolina, they, have, discovered, a, remedy, for, this, disease, the, purported, cure, implied, a, critique, of, modern, science, and, an, appreciation, for, the, simple, wisdom, of, simple, people, they, say, that, common, baking, soda, will, cure, the, disease, he, continued, that, they, have, cured, it, with, it, that, they, have, no, deaths, up, there, at, all, they, use, common, baking, soda, which, cures, the, disease, sodium, bicarbonate, is, produced, industrially, from, sodium, carbonate, it, is, produced, on, the, scale, of, about, 100, 000, tonnes, year, as, of, 2001, with, a, worldwide, production, capacity, of, 2, 4, million, tonnes, per, year, as, of, 2002, commercial, quantities, of, baking, soda, are, also, produced, by, a, similar, method, soda, ash, mined, in, the, form, of, the, ore, trona, is, dissolved, in, water, and, treated, with, carbon, dioxide, sodium, bicarbonate, precipitates, as, a, solid, from, this, solution, regarding, the, solvay, process, sodium, bicarbonate, is, an, intermediate, in, the, reaction, of, sodium, chloride, ammonia, and, carbon, dioxide, the, product, however, shows, low, purity, 75pc, although, of, no, practical, value, nahco, 3, may, be, obtained, by, the, reaction, of, carbon, dioxide, with, an, aqueous, solution, of, sodium, hydroxide, naturally, occurring, deposits, of, nahcolite, nahco, 3, are, found, in, the, eocene, age, 55, 8, 33, 9, mya, green, river, formation, piceance, basin, in, colorado, nahcolite, was, deposited, as, beds, during, periods, of, high, evaporation, in, the, basin, it, is, commercially, mined, using, common, underground, mining, techniques, such, as, bore, drum, and, longwall, mining, in, a, fashion, very, similar, to, coal, mining, it, is, also, produced, by, solution, mining, pumping, heated, water, through, nahcolite, beds, and, crystallizing, the, dissolved, nahcolite, through, a, cooling, crystallization, process, since, nahcolite, is, sometimes, found, in, shale, it, can, be, produced, as, a, co, product, of, shale, oil, extraction, where, it, is, recovered, by, solution, mining, sodium, bicarbonate, as, bicarbonate, of, soda, was, a, frequent, source, of, punch, lines, for, groucho, marx, in, marx, brothers, movies, in, duck, soup, marx, plays, the, leader, of, a, nation, at, war, in, one, scene, he, receives, a, message, from, the, battlefield, that, his, general, is, reporting, a, gas, attack, and, groucho, tells, his, aide, tell, him, to, take, a, teaspoonful, of, bicarbonate, of, soda, and, a, half, a, glass, of, water, in, a, night, at, the, opera, groucho, s, character, addresses, the, opening, night, crowd, at, an, opera, by, saying, of, the, lead, tenor, signor, lassparri, comes, from, a, very, famous, family, his, mother, was, a, well, known, bass, singer, his, father, was, the, first, man, to, stuff, spaghetti, with, bicarbonate, of, soda, thus, causing, and, curing, indigestion, at, the, same, time, in, the, joseph, l, mankewicz, classic, all, about, eve, the, max, fabian, character, gregory, ratoff, has, an, extended, scene, with, margo, channing, bette, davis, in, which, suffering, from, heartburn, he, requests, and, then, drinks, bicarbonate, of, soda, eliciting, a, prominent, burp, channing, promises, to, always, keep, a, box, of, bicarb, with, max, s, name, on, it
