chemical, synthesis, chemical, combination, is, the, artificial, execution, of, chemical, reactions, to, obtain, one, or, several, products, this, occurs, by, physical, and, chemical, manipulations, usually, involving, one, or, more, reactions, in, modern, laboratory, uses, the, process, is, reproducible, and, reliable, a, chemical, synthesis, involves, one, or, more, compounds, known, as, reagents, or, reactants, that, will, experience, a, transformation, when, subjected, to, certain, conditions, various, reaction, types, can, be, applied, to, formulate, a, desired, product, this, requires, mixing, the, compounds, in, a, reaction, vessel, such, as, a, chemical, reactor, or, a, simple, round, bottom, flask, many, reactions, require, some, form, of, processing, work, up, or, purification, procedure, to, isolate, the, final, product, the, amount, produced, by, chemical, synthesis, is, known, as, the, reaction, yield, typically, yields, are, expressed, as, a, mass, in, grams, in, a, laboratory, setting, or, as, a, percentage, of, the, total, theoretical, quantity, that, could, be, produced, based, on, the, limiting, reagent, a, side, reaction, is, an, unwanted, chemical, reaction, occurring, which, reduces, the, desired, yield, the, word, synthesis, was, used, first, in, a, chemical, context, by, the, chemist, hermann, kolbe, many, strategies, exist, in, chemical, synthesis, that, are, more, complicated, than, simply, converting, a, reactant, a, to, a, reaction, product, b, directly, for, multistep, synthesis, a, chemical, compound, is, synthesized, by, a, series, of, individual, chemical, reactions, each, with, its, own, work, up, for, example, a, laboratory, synthesis, of, paracetamol, can, consist, of, three, sequential, parts, for, cascade, reactions, multiple, chemical, transformations, occur, within, a, single, reactant, for, multi, component, reactions, as, many, as, 11, different, reactants, form, a, single, reaction, product, and, for, a, telescopic, synthesis, one, reactant, experiences, multiple, transformations, without, isolation, of, intermediates, organic, synthesis, is, a, special, type, of, chemical, synthesis, dealing, with, the, synthesis, of, organic, compounds, for, the, total, synthesis, of, a, complex, product, multiple, procedures, in, sequence, may, be, required, to, synthesize, the, product, of, interest, requiring, a, large, amount, of, time, skill, in, organic, synthesis, is, prized, among, chemists, and, the, synthesis, of, exceptionally, valuable, or, difficult, compounds, has, won, chemists, such, as, robert, burns, woodward, a, nobel, prize, for, chemistry, if, a, chemical, synthesis, starts, from, basic, laboratory, compounds, it, is, considered, a, purely, synthetic, process, if, it, starts, from, a, product, isolated, from, plants, or, animals, and, then, proceeds, to, new, compounds, the, synthesis, is, described, as, a, semisynthetic, process, inorganic, synthesis, and, organometallic, synthesis, are, applied, to, the, preparation, of, compounds, with, significant, non, organic, content, an, illustrative, example, is, the, preparation, of, the, anti, cancer, drug, cisplatin, from, potassium, tetrachloroplatinate
