lanthanide, series, terbium, is, a, fairly, electropositive, metal, that, reacts, with, water, evolving, hydrogen, gas, terbium, is, never, found, in, nature, as, a, free, element, but, it, is, contained, in, many, minerals, including, cerite, gadolinite, monazite, xenotime, and, euxenite, swedish, chemist, carl, gustaf, mosander, discovered, terbium, as, a, chemical, element, in, 1843, he, detected, it, as, an, impurity, in, yttrium, oxide, y, 2, o, 3, yttrium, and, terbium, as, well, as, erbium, and, ytterbium, are, named, after, the, village, of, ytterby, in, sweden, terbium, was, not, isolated, in, pure, form, until, the, advent, of, ion, exchange, techniques, terbium, is, used, to, dope, calcium, fluoride, calcium, tungstate, and, strontium, molybdate, in, solid, state, devices, and, as, a, crystal, stabilizer, of, fuel, cells, that, operate, at, elevated, temperatures, as, a, component, of, terfenol, d, an, alloy, that, expands, and, contracts, when, exposed, to, magnetic, fields, more, than, any, other, alloy, terbium, is, of, use, in, actuators, in, naval, sonar, systems, and, in, sensors, terbium, is, considered, non, hazardous, though, its, biological, role, and, toxicity, has, not, been, researched, in, depth, most, of, the, world, s, terbium, supply, is, used, in, green, phosphors, terbium, oxide, is, used, in, fluorescent, lamps, and, television,

not, isolated, in, pure, form, until, the, advent, of, ion, exchange, techniques, mosander, first, separated, yttria, into, three, fractions, all, named, for, the, ore, yttria, erbia, and, terbia, terbia, was, originally, the, fraction, that, contained, the, pink, color, due, to, the, element, now, known, as, erbium, erbia, the, oxide, containing, what, is, now, known, as, terbium, originally, was, the, fraction, that, was, yellow, or, dark, orange, in, solution, the, insoluble, oxide, of, this, element, was, noted, to, be, tinged, brown, and, soluble, oxides, after, combustion, were, noted, to, be, colorless, until, the, advent, of, spectral, analysis, arguments, went, back, and, forth, as, to, whether, erbia, even, existed, spectral, analysis, by, marc, delafontaine, allowed, the, separate, elements, and, their, oxides, to, be, identified, but, in, his, publications, the, names, of, erbium, and, terbium, were, switched, following, a, brief, period, where, terbium, was, renamed, mosandrum, after, mosander, the, names, have, remained, switched, ever, since, the, early, years, of, preparing, terbium, as, terbium, oxide, were, difficult, metal, oxides, from, gadolinite, and, samarskite, were, dissolved, in, nitric, acid, and, the, solution, was, further, separated, using, oxalic, acid, and, potassium, sulfate, there, was, great, difficulty, in, separating, erbia, from, terbia, in, 1881, it, was, noted, that, there, was, no, satisfactory, method, to, separate, the, two, by, 1914, different, solvents, had, been, used, to, separate, terbium, from, its, host, minerals, but, the, process, of, separating, terbium, from, its, neighbor, elements, gadolinium, and, dysprosium, was, described, as, tedious, but, possible, modern, terbium, extraction, methods, are,
