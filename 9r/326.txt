mass, spectrometry, ms, is, an, analytical, technique, that, is, used, to, measure, the, mass, to, charge, ratio, of, ions, the, results, are, presented, as, a, mass, spectrum, a, plot, of, intensity, as, a, function, of, the, mass, to, charge, ratio, mass, spectrometry, is, used, in, many, different, fields, and, is, applied, to, pure, samples, as, well, as, complex, mixtures, a, mass, spectrum, is, a, type, of, plot, of, the, ion, signal, as, a, function, of, the, mass, to, charge, ratio, these, spectra, are, used, to, determine, the, elemental, or, isotopic, signature, of, a, sample, the, masses, of, particles, and, of, molecules, and, to, elucidate, the, chemical, identity, or, structure, of, molecules, and, other, chemical, compounds, in, a, typical, ms, procedure, a, sample, which, may, be, solid, liquid, or, gaseous, is, ionized, for, example, by, bombarding, it, with, a, beam, of, electrons, this, may, cause, some, of, the, sample, s, molecules, to, break, up, into, positively, charged, fragments, or, simply, become, positively, charged, without, fragmenting, these, ions, fragments, are, then, separated, according, to, their, mass, to, charge, ratio, for, example, by, accelerating, them, and, subjecting, them, to, an, electric, or, magnetic, field, ions, of, the, same, mass, to, charge, ratio, will, undergo, the, same, amount, of, deflection, the, ions, are, detected, by, a, mechanism, capable, of, detecting, charged, particles, such, as, an, electron, multiplier, results, are, displayed, as, spectra, of, the, signal, intensity, of, detected, ions, as, a, function, of, the, mass, to, charge, ratio, the, atoms, or, molecules, in, the, sample, can, be, identified, by, correlating, known, masses, e, g, an, entire, molecule, to, the, identified, masses, or, through, a, characteristic, fragmentation, pattern, in, 1886, eugen, goldstein, observed, rays, in, gas, discharges, under, low, pressure, that, traveled, away, from, the, anode, and, through, channels, in, a, perforated, cathode, opposite, to, the, direction, of, negatively, charged, cathode, rays, which, travel, from, cathode, to, anode, goldstein, called, these, positively, charged, anode, rays, kanalstrahlen, the, standard, translation, of, this, term, into, english, is, canal, rays, wilhelm, wien, found, that, strong, electric, or, magnetic, fields, deflected, the, canal, rays, and, in, 1899, constructed, a, device, with, perpendicular, electric, and, magnetic, fields, that, separated, the, positive, rays, according, to, their, charge, to, mass, ratio, q, m, wien, found, that, the, charge, to, mass, ratio, depended, on, the, nature, of, the, gas, in, the, discharge, tube, english, scientist, j, j, thomson, later, improved, on, the, work, of, wien, by, reducing, the, pressure, to, create, the, mass, spectrograph, the, word, spectrograph, had, become, part, of, the, international, scientific, vocabulary, by, 1884, early, spectrometry, devices, that, measured, the, mass, to, charge, ratio, of, ions, were, called, mass, spectrographs, which, consisted, of, instruments, that, recorded, a, spectrum, of, mass, values, on, a, photographic, plate, a, mass, spectroscope, is, similar, to, a, mass, spectrograph, except, that, the, beam, of, ions, is, directed, onto, a, phosphor, screen, a, mass, spectroscope, configuration, was, used, in, early, instruments, when, it, was, desired, that, the, effects, of, adjustments, be, quickly, observed, once, the, instrument, was, properly, adjusted, a, photographic, plate, was, inserted, and, exposed, the, term, mass, spectroscope, continued, to, be, used, even, though, the, direct, illumination, of, a, phosphor, screen, was, replaced, by, indirect, measurements, with, an, oscilloscope, the, use, of, the, term, mass, spectroscopy, is, now, discouraged, due, to, the, possibility, of, confusion, with, light, spectroscopy, mass, spectrometry, is, often, abbreviated, as, mass, spec, or, simply, as, ms, modern, techniques, of, mass, spectrometry, were, devised, by, arthur, jeffrey, dempster, and, f, w, aston, in, 1918, and, 1919, respectively, sector, mass, spectrometers, known, as, calutrons, were, developed, by, ernest, o, lawrence, and, used, for, separating, the, isotopes, of, uranium, during, the, manhattan, project, calutron, mass, spectrometers, were, used, for, uranium, enrichment, at, the, oak, ridge, tennessee, y, 12, plant, established, during, world, war, ii, in, 1989, half, of, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, was, awarded, to, hans, dehmelt, and, wolfgang, paul, for, the, development, of, the, ion, trap, technique, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, in, 2002, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, was, awarded, to, john, bennett, fenn, for, the, development, of, electrospray, ionization, esi, and, koichi, tanaka, for, the, development, of, soft, laser, desorption, sld, and, their, application, to, the, ionization, of, biological, macromolecules, especially, proteins, a, mass, spectrometer, consists, of, three, components, an, ion, source, a, mass, analyzer, and, a, detector, the, ionizer, converts, a, portion, of, the, sample, into, ions, there, is, a, wide, variety, of, ionization, techniques, depending, on, the, phase, solid, liquid, gas, of, the, sample, and, the, efficiency, of, various, ionization, mechanisms, for, the, unknown, species, an, extraction, system, removes, ions, from, the, sample, which, are, then, targeted, through, the, mass, analyzer, and, into, the, detector, the, differences, in, masses, of, the, fragments, allows, the, mass, analyzer, to, sort, the, ions, by, their, mass, to, charge, ratio, the, detector, measures, the, value, of, an, indicator, quantity, and, thus, provides, data, for, calculating, the, abundances, of, each, ion, present, some, detectors, also, give, spatial, information, e, g, a, multichannel, plate, the, following, describes, the, operation, of, a, spectrometer, mass, analyzer, which, is, of, the, sector, type, other, analyzer, types, are, treated, below, consider, a, sample, of, sodium, chloride, table, salt, in, the, ion, source, the, sample, is, vaporized, turned, into, gas, and, ionized, transformed, into, electrically, charged, particles, into, sodium, na, and, chloride, cl, ions, sodium, atoms, and, ions, are, monoisotopic, with, a, mass, of, about, 23, daltons, symbol, da, or, older, symbol, u, chloride, atoms, and, ions, come, in, two, stable, isotopes, with, masses, of, approximately, 35, u, at, a, natural, abundance, of, about, 75, percent, and, approximately, 37, u, at, a, natural, abundance, of, about, 25, percent, the, analyzer, part, of, the, spectrometer, contains, electric, and, magnetic, fields, which, exert, forces, on, ions, traveling, through, these, fields, the, speed, of, a, charged, particle, may, be, increased, or, decreased, while, passing, through, the, electric, field, and, its, direction, may, be, altered, by, the, magnetic, field, the, magnitude, of, the, deflection, of, the, moving, ion, s, trajectory, depends, on, its, mass, to, charge, ratio, lighter, ions, are, deflected, by, the, magnetic, force, to, a, greater, degree, than, heavier, ions, based, on, newton, s, second, law, of, motion, f, ma, the, streams, of, magnetically, sorted, ions, pass, from, the, analyzer, to, the, detector, which, records, the, relative, abundance, of, each, ion, type, this, information, is, used, to, determine, the, chemical, element, composition, of, the, original, sample, i, e, that, both, sodium, and, chlorine, are, present, in, the, sample, and, the, isotopic, composition, of, its, constituents, the, ratio, of, 35, cl, to, 37, cl, the, ion, source, is, the, part, of, the, mass, spectrometer, that, ionizes, the, material, under, analysis, the, analyte, the, ions, are, then, transported, by, magnetic, or, electric, fields, to, the, mass, analyzer, techniques, for, ionization, have, been, key, to, determining, what, types, of, samples, can, be, analyzed, by, mass, spectrometry, electron, ionization, and, chemical, ionization, are, used, for, gases, and, vapors, in, chemical, ionization, sources, the, analyte, is, ionized, by, chemical, ion, molecule, reactions, during, collisions, in, the, source, two, techniques, often, used, with, liquid, and, solid, biological, samples, include, electrospray, ionization, invented, by, john, fenn, and, matrix, assisted, laser, desorption, ionization, maldi, initially, developed, as, a, similar, technique, soft, laser, desorption, sld, by, k, tanaka, for, which, a, nobel, prize, was, awarded, and, as, maldi, by, m, karas, and, f, hillenkamp, in, mass, spectrometry, ionization, refers, to, the, production, of, gas, phase, ions, suitable, for, resolution, in, the, mass, analyser, or, mass, filter, ionization, occurs, in, the, ion, source, there, are, several, ion, sources, available, each, has, advantages, and, disadvantages, for, particular, applications, for, example, electron, ionization, ei, gives, a, high, degree, of, fragmentation, yielding, highly, detailed, mass, spectra, which, when, skilfully, analysed, can, provide, important, information, for, structural, elucidation, characterisation, and, facilitate, identification, of, unknown, compounds, by, comparison, to, mass, spectral, libraries, obtained, under, identical, operating, conditions, however, ei, is, not, suitable, for, coupling, to, hplc, i, e, lc, ms, since, at, atmospheric, pressure, the, filaments, used, to, generate, electrons, burn, out, rapidly, thus, ei, is, coupled, predominantly, with, gc, i, e, gc, ms, where, the, entire, system, is, under, high, vacuum, hard, ionization, techniques, are, processes, which, impart, high, quantities, of, residual, energy, in, the, subject, molecule, invoking, large, degrees, of, fragmentation, i, e, the, systematic, rupturing, of, bonds, acts, to, remove, the, excess, energy, restoring, stability, to, the, resulting, ion, resultant, ions, tend, to, have, m, z, lower, than, the, molecular, ion, other, than, in, the, case, of, proton, transfer, and, not, including, isotope, peaks, the, most, common, example, of, hard, ionization, is, electron, ionization, ei, soft, ionization, refers, to, the, processes, which, impart, little, residual, energy, onto, the, subject, molecule, and, as, such, result, in, little, fragmentation, examples, include, fast, atom, bombardment, fab, chemical, ionization, ci, atmospheric, pressure, chemical, ionization, apci, atmospheric, pressure, photoionization, appi, electrospray, ionization, esi, desorption, electrospray, ionization, desi, and, matrix, assisted, laser, desorption, ionization, maldi, inductively, coupled, plasma, icp, sources, are, used, primarily, for, cation, analysis, of, a, wide, array, of, sample, types, in, this, source, a, plasma, that, is, electrically, neutral, overall, but, that, has, had, a, substantial, fraction, of, its, atoms, ionized, by, high, temperature, is, used, to, atomize, introduced, sample, molecules, and, to, further, strip, the, outer, electrons, from, those, atoms, the, plasma, is, usually, generated, from, argon, gas, since, the, first, ionization, energy, of, argon, atoms, is, higher, than, the, first, of, any, other, elements, except, he, f, and, ne, but, lower, than, the, second, ionization, energy, of, all, except, the, most, electropositive, metals, the, heating, is, achieved, by, a, radio, frequency, current, passed, through, a, coil, surrounding, the, plasma, photoionization, can, be, used, in, experiments, which, seek, to, use, mass, spectrometry, as, a, means, of, resolving, chemical, kinetics, mechanisms, and, isomeric, product, branching, in, such, instances, a, high, energy, photon, either, x, ray, or, uv, is, used, to, dissociate, stable, gaseous, molecules, in, a, carrier, gas, of, he, or, ar, in, instances, where, a, synchrotron, light, source, is, utilized, a, tuneable, photon, energy, can, be, utilized, to, acquire, a, photoionization, efficiency, curve, which, can, be, used, in, conjunction, with, the, charge, ratio, m, z, to, fingerprint, molecular, and, ionic, species, more, recently, atmospheric, pressure, photoionization, appi, has, been, developed, to, ionize, molecules, mostly, as, effluents, of, lc, ms, systems, some, applications, for, ambient, ionization, include, environmental, applications, as, well, as, clinical, applications, in, these, techniques, ions, form, in, an, ion, source, outside, the, mass, spectrometer, sampling, becomes, easy, as, the, samples, don, t, need, previous, separation, nor, preparation, some, examples, of, ambient, ionization, techniques, are, direct, analysis, in, real, time, dart, desi, sesi, laesi, desorption, atmospheric, pressure, chemical, ionization, dapci, soft, ionization, by, chemical, reaction, in, transfer, sicrt, and, desorption, atmospheric, pressure, photoionization, dappi, among, others, others, include, glow, discharge, field, desorption, fd, fast, atom, bombardment, fab, thermospray, desorption, ionization, on, silicon, dios, atmospheric, pressure, chemical, ionization, apci, secondary, ion, mass, spectrometry, sims, spark, ionization, and, thermal, ionization, tims, mass, analyzers, separate, the, ions, according, to, their, mass, to, charge, ratio, the, following, two, laws, govern, the, dynamics, of, charged, particles, in, electric, and, magnetic, fields, in, vacuum, here, f, is, the, force, applied, to, the, ion, m, is, the, mass, of, the, ion, a, is, the, acceleration, q, is, the, ion, charge, e, is, the, electric, field, and, v, b, is, the, vector, cross, product, of, the, ion, velocity, and, the, magnetic, field, equating, the, above, expressions, for, the, force, applied, to, the, ion, yields, this, differential, equation, is, the, classic, equation, of, motion, for, charged, particles, together, with, the, particle, s, initial, conditions, it, completely, determines, the, particle, s, motion, in, space, and, time, in, terms, of, m, q, thus, mass, spectrometers, could, be, thought, of, as, mass, to, charge, spectrometers, when, presenting, data, it, is, common, to, use, the, officially, dimensionless, m, z, where, z, is, the, number, of, elementary, charges, e, on, the, ion, z, q, e, this, quantity, although, it, is, informally, called, the, mass, to, charge, ratio, more, accurately, speaking, represents, the, ratio, of, the, mass, number, and, the, charge, number, z, there, are, many, types, of, mass, analyzers, using, either, static, or, dynamic, fields, and, magnetic, or, electric, fields, but, all, operate, according, to, the, above, differential, equation, each, analyzer, type, has, its, strengths, and, weaknesses, many, mass, spectrometers, use, two, or, more, mass, analyzers, for, tandem, mass, spectrometry, ms, ms, in, addition, to, the, more, common, mass, analyzers, listed, below, there, are, others, designed, for, special, situations, there, are, several, important, analyzer, characteristics, the, mass, resolving, power, is, the, measure, of, the, ability, to, distinguish, two, peaks, of, slightly, different, m, z, the, mass, accuracy, is, the, ratio, of, the, m, z, measurement, error, to, the, true, m, z, mass, accuracy, is, usually, measured, in, ppm, or, milli, mass, units, the, mass, range, is, the, range, of, m, z, amenable, to, analysis, by, a, given, analyzer, the, linear, dynamic, range, is, the, range, over, which, ion, signal, is, linear, with, analyte, concentration, speed, refers, to, the, time, frame, of, the, experiment, and, ultimately, is, used, to, determine, the, number, of, spectra, per, unit, time, that, can, be, generated, a, sector, field, mass, analyzer, uses, a, static, electric, and, or, magnetic, field, to, affect, the, path, and, or, velocity, of, the, charged, particles, in, some, way, as, shown, above, sector, instruments, bend, the, trajectories, of, the, ions, as, they, pass, through, the, mass, analyzer, according, to, their, mass, to, charge, ratios, deflecting, the, more, charged, and, faster, moving, lighter, ions, more, the, analyzer, can, be, used, to, select, a, narrow, range, of, m, z, or, to, scan, through, a, range, of, m, z, to, catalog, the, ions, present, the, time, of, flight, tof, analyzer, uses, an, electric, field, to, accelerate, the, ions, through, the, same, potential, and, then, measures, the, time, they, take, to, reach, the, detector, if, the, particles, all, have, the, same, charge, their, kinetic, energies, will, be, identical, and, their, velocities, will, depend, only, on, their, masses, for, example, ions, with, a, lower, mass, will, travel, faster, reaching, the, detector, first, ions, usually, are, moving, prior, to, being, accelerated, by, the, electric, field, this, causes, particles, with, the, same, m, z, to, arrive, at, different, times, at, the, detector, this, difference, in, initial, velocities, is, often, not, dependent, on, the, mass, of, the, ion, and, will, turn, into, a, difference, in, the, final, velocity, this, distribution, in, velocities, broadens, the, peaks, shown, on, the, count, vs, m, z, plot, but, will, generally, not, change, the, central, location, of, the, peaks, since, the, starting, velocity, of, ions, is, generally, centered, at, zero, to, fix, this, problem, time, lag, focusing, delayed, extraction, has, been, coupled, with, tof, ms, quadrupole, mass, analyzers, use, oscillating, electrical, fields, to, selectively, stabilize, or, destabilize, the, paths, of, ions, passing, through, a, radio, frequency, rf, quadrupole, field, created, between, four, parallel, rods, only, the, ions, in, a, certain, range, of, mass, charge, ratio, are, passed, through, the, system, at, any, time, but, changes, to, the, potentials, on, the, rods, allow, a, wide, range, of, m, z, values, to, be, swept, rapidly, either, continuously, or, in, a, succession, of, discrete, hops, a, quadrupole, mass, analyzer, acts, as, a, mass, selective, filter, and, is, closely, related, to, the, quadrupole, ion, trap, particularly, the, linear, quadrupole, ion, trap, except, that, it, is, designed, to, pass, the, untrapped, ions, rather, than, collect, the, trapped, ones, and, is, for, that, reason, referred, to, as, a, transmission, quadrupole, a, magnetically, enhanced, quadrupole, mass, analyzer, includes, the, addition, of, a, magnetic, field, either, applied, axially, or, transversely, this, novel, type, of, instrument, leads, to, an, additional, performance, enhancement, in, terms, of, resolution, and, or, sensitivity, depending, upon, the, magnitude, and, orientation, of, the, applied, magnetic, field, a, common, variation, of, the, transmission, quadrupole, is, the, triple, quadrupole, mass, spectrometer, the, triple, quad, has, three, consecutive, quadrupole, stages, the, first, acting, as, a, mass, filter, to, transmit, a, particular, incoming, ion, to, the, second, quadrupole, a, collision, chamber, wherein, that, ion, can, be, broken, into, fragments, the, third, quadrupole, also, acts, as, a, mass, filter, to, transmit, a, particular, fragment, ion, to, the, detector, if, a, quadrupole, is, made, to, rapidly, and, repetitively, cycle, through, a, range, of, mass, filter, settings, full, spectra, can, be, reported, likewise, a, triple, quad, can, be, made, to, perform, various, scan, types, characteristic, of, tandem, mass, spectrometry, the, quadrupole, ion, trap, works, on, the, same, physical, principles, as, the, quadrupole, mass, analyzer, but, the, ions, are, trapped, and, sequentially, ejected, ions, are, trapped, in, a, mainly, quadrupole, rf, field, in, a, space, defined, by, a, ring, electrode, usually, connected, to, the, main, rf, potential, between, two, endcap, electrodes, typically, connected, to, dc, or, auxiliary, ac, potentials, the, sample, is, ionized, either, internally, e, g, with, an, electron, or, laser, beam, or, externally, in, which, case, the, ions, are, often, introduced, through, an, aperture, in, an, endcap, electrode, there, are, many, mass, charge, separation, and, isolation, methods, but, the, most, commonly, used, is, the, mass, instability, mode, in, which, the, rf, potential, is, ramped, so, that, the, orbit, of, ions, with, a, mass, a, b, are, stable, while, ions, with, mass, b, become, unstable, and, are, ejected, on, the, z, axis, onto, a, detector, there, are, also, non, destructive, analysis, methods, ions, may, also, be, ejected, by, the, resonance, excitation, method, whereby, a, supplemental, oscillatory, excitation, voltage, is, applied, to, the, endcap, electrodes, and, the, trapping, voltage, amplitude, and, or, excitation, voltage, frequency, is, varied, to, bring, ions, into, a, resonance, condition, in, order, of, their, mass, charge, ratio, the, cylindrical, ion, trap, mass, spectrometer, cit, is, a, derivative, of, the, quadrupole, ion, trap, where, the, electrodes, are, formed, from, flat, rings, rather, than, hyperbolic, shaped, electrodes, the, architecture, lends, itself, well, to, miniaturization, because, as, the, size, of, a, trap, is, reduced, the, shape, of, the, electric, field, near, the, center, of, the, trap, the, region, where, the, ions, are, trapped, forms, a, shape, similar, to, that, of, a, hyperbolic, trap, a, linear, quadrupole, ion, trap, is, similar, to, a, quadrupole, ion, trap, but, it, traps, ions, in, a, two, dimensional, quadrupole, field, instead, of, a, three, dimensional, quadrupole, field, as, in, a, 3d, quadrupole, ion, trap, thermo, fisher, s, ltq, linear, trap, quadrupole, is, an, example, of, the, linear, ion, trap, a, toroidal, ion, trap, can, be, visualized, as, a, linear, quadrupole, curved, around, and, connected, at, the, ends, or, as, a, cross, section, of, a, 3d, ion, trap, rotated, on, edge, to, form, the, toroid, donut, shaped, trap, the, trap, can, store, large, volumes, of, ions, by, distributing, them, throughout, the, ring, like, trap, structure, this, toroidal, shaped, trap, is, a, configuration, that, allows, the, increased, miniaturization, of, an, ion, trap, mass, analyzer, additionally, all, ions, are, stored, in, the, same, trapping, field, and, ejected, together, simplifying, detection, that, can, be, complicated, with, array, configurations, due, to, variations, in, detector, alignment, and, machining, of, the, arrays, as, with, the, toroidal, trap, linear, traps, and, 3d, quadrupole, ion, traps, are, the, most, commonly, miniaturized, mass, analyzers, due, to, their, high, sensitivity, tolerance, for, mtorr, pressure, and, capabilities, for, single, analyzer, tandem, mass, spectrometry, e, g, product, ion, scans, orbitrap, instruments, are, similar, to, fourier, transform, ion, cyclotron, resonance, mass, spectrometers, see, text, below, ions, are, electrostatically, trapped, in, an, orbit, around, a, central, spindle, shaped, electrode, the, electrode, confines, the, ions, so, that, they, both, orbit, around, the, central, electrode, and, oscillate, back, and, forth, along, the, central, electrode, s, long, axis, this, oscillation, generates, an, image, current, in, the, detector, plates, which, is, recorded, by, the, instrument, the, frequencies, of, these, image, currents, depend, on, the, mass, to, charge, ratios, of, the, ions, mass, spectra, are, obtained, by, fourier, transformation, of, the, recorded, image, currents, orbitraps, have, a, high, mass, accuracy, high, sensitivity, and, a, good, dynamic, range, fourier, transform, mass, spectrometry, ftms, or, more, precisely, fourier, transform, ion, cyclotron, resonance, ms, measures, mass, by, detecting, the, image, current, produced, by, ions, cyclotroning, in, the, presence, of, a, magnetic, field, instead, of, measuring, the, deflection, of, ions, with, a, detector, such, as, an, electron, multiplier, the, ions, are, injected, into, a, penning, trap, a, static, electric, magnetic, ion, trap, where, they, effectively, form, part, of, a, circuit, detectors, at, fixed, positions, in, space, measure, the, electrical, signal, of, ions, which, pass, near, them, over, time, producing, a, periodic, signal, since, the, frequency, of, an, ion, s, cycling, is, determined, by, its, mass, to, charge, ratio, this, can, be, deconvoluted, by, performing, a, fourier, transform, on, the, signal, ftms, has, the, advantage, of, high, sensitivity, since, each, ion, is, counted, more, than, once, and, much, higher, resolution, and, thus, precision, ion, cyclotron, resonance, icr, is, an, older, mass, analysis, technique, similar, to, ftms, except, that, ions, are, detected, with, a, traditional, detector, ions, trapped, in, a, penning, trap, are, excited, by, an, rf, electric, field, until, they, impact, the, wall, of, the, trap, where, the, detector, is, located, ions, of, different, mass, are, resolved, according, to, impact, time, the, final, element, of, the, mass, spectrometer, is, the, detector, the, detector, records, either, the, charge, induced, or, the, current, produced, when, an, ion, passes, by, or, hits, a, surface, in, a, scanning, instrument, the, signal, produced, in, the, detector, during, the, course, of, the, scan, versus, where, the, instrument, is, in, the, scan, at, what, m, q, will, produce, a, mass, spectrum, a, record, of, ions, as, a, function, of, m, q, typically, some, type, of, electron, multiplier, is, used, though, other, detectors, including, faraday, cups, and, ion, to, photon, detectors, are, also, used, because, the, number, of, ions, leaving, the, mass, analyzer, at, a, particular, instant, is, typically, quite, small, considerable, amplification, is, often, necessary, to, get, a, signal, microchannel, plate, detectors, are, commonly, used, in, modern, commercial, instruments, in, ftms, and, orbitraps, the, detector, consists, of, a, pair, of, metal, surfaces, within, the, mass, analyzer, ion, trap, region, which, the, ions, only, pass, near, as, they, oscillate, no, direct, current, is, produced, only, a, weak, ac, image, current, is, produced, in, a, circuit, between, the, electrodes, other, inductive, detectors, have, also, been, used, a, tandem, mass, spectrometer, is, one, capable, of, multiple, rounds, of, mass, spectrometry, usually, separated, by, some, form, of, molecule, fragmentation, for, example, one, mass, analyzer, can, isolate, one, peptide, from, many, entering, a, mass, spectrometer, a, collision, cell, then, stabilizes, the, peptide, ions, while, they, collide, with, a, gas, causing, them, to, fragment, by, collision, induced, dissociation, cid, a, further, mass, analyzer, then, sorts, the, fragments, produced, from, the, peptides, tandem, ms, can, also, be, done, in, a, single, mass, analyzer, over, time, as, in, a, quadrupole, ion, trap, there, are, various, methods, for, fragmenting, molecules, for, tandem, ms, including, collision, induced, dissociation, cid, electron, capture, dissociation, ecd, electron, transfer, dissociation, etd, infrared, multiphoton, dissociation, irmpd, blackbody, infrared, radiative, dissociation, bird, electron, detachment, dissociation, edd, and, surface, induced, dissociation, sid, an, important, application, using, tandem, mass, spectrometry, is, in, protein, identification, tandem, mass, spectrometry, enables, a, variety, of, experimental, sequences, many, commercial, mass, spectrometers, are, designed, to, expedite, the, execution, of, such, routine, sequences, as, selected, reaction, monitoring, srm, precursor, ion, scanning, product, ion, scanning, and, neutral, loss, scanning, another, type, of, tandem, mass, spectrometry, used, for, radiocarbon, dating, is, accelerator, mass, spectrometry, ams, which, uses, very, high, voltages, usually, in, the, mega, volt, range, to, accelerate, negative, ions, into, a, type, of, tandem, mass, spectrometer, the, metlin, metabolite, and, chemical, entity, database, is, the, largest, repository, of, experimental, tandem, mass, spectrometry, data, acquired, from, standards, the, tandem, mass, spectrometry, data, on, over, 930, 000, molecular, standards, as, of, january, 2024, is, provided, to, facilitate, the, identification, of, chemical, entities, from, tandem, mass, spectrometry, experiments, in, addition, to, the, identification, of, known, molecules, it, is, also, useful, for, identifying, unknowns, using, its, similarity, searching, analysis, all, tandem, mass, spectrometry, data, comes, from, the, experimental, analysis, of, standards, at, multiple, collision, energies, and, in, both, positive, and, negative, ionization, modes, when, a, specific, combination, of, source, analyzer, and, detector, becomes, conventional, in, practice, a, compound, acronym, may, arise, to, designate, it, succinctly, one, example, is, maldi, tof, which, refers, to, a, combination, of, a, matrix, assisted, laser, desorption, ionization, source, with, a, time, of, flight, mass, analyzer, other, examples, include, inductively, coupled, plasma, mass, spectrometry, icp, ms, accelerator, mass, spectrometry, ams, thermal, ionization, mass, spectrometry, tims, and, spark, source, mass, spectrometry, ssms, certain, applications, of, mass, spectrometry, have, developed, monikers, that, although, strictly, speaking, would, seem, to, refer, to, a, broad, application, in, practice, have, come, instead, to, connote, a, specific, or, a, limited, number, of, instrument, configurations, an, example, of, this, is, isotope, ratio, mass, spectrometry, irms, which, refers, in, practice, to, the, use, of, a, limited, number, of, sector, based, mass, analyzers, this, name, is, used, to, refer, to, both, the, application, and, the, instrument, used, for, the, application, an, important, enhancement, to, the, mass, resolving, and, mass, determining, capabilities, of, mass, spectrometry, is, using, it, in, tandem, with, chromatographic, and, other, separation, techniques, a, common, combination, is, gas, chromatography, mass, spectrometry, gc, ms, or, gc, ms, in, this, technique, a, gas, chromatograph, is, used, to, separate, different, compounds, this, stream, of, separated, compounds, is, fed, online, into, the, ion, source, a, metallic, filament, to, which, voltage, is, applied, this, filament, emits, electrons, which, ionize, the, compounds, the, ions, can, then, further, fragment, yielding, predictable, patterns, intact, ions, and, fragments, pass, into, the, mass, spectrometer, s, analyzer, and, are, eventually, detected, however, the, high, temperatures, 300, c, used, in, the, gc, ms, injection, port, and, oven, can, result, in, thermal, degradation, of, injected, molecules, thus, resulting, in, the, measurement, of, degradation, products, instead, of, the, actual, molecule, s, of, interest, similarly, to, gas, chromatography, ms, gc, ms, liquid, chromatography, mass, spectrometry, lc, ms, or, lc, ms, separates, compounds, chromatographically, before, they, are, introduced, to, the, ion, source, and, mass, spectrometer, it, differs, from, gc, ms, in, that, the, mobile, phase, is, liquid, usually, a, mixture, of, water, and, organic, solvents, instead, of, gas, most, commonly, an, electrospray, ionization, source, is, used, in, lc, ms, other, popular, and, commercially, available, lc, ms, ion, sources, are, atmospheric, pressure, chemical, ionization, and, atmospheric, pressure, photoionization, there, are, also, some, newly, developed, ionization, techniques, like, laser, spray, capillary, electrophoresis, mass, spectrometry, ce, ms, is, a, technique, that, combines, the, liquid, separation, process, of, capillary, electrophoresis, with, mass, spectrometry, ce, ms, is, typically, coupled, to, electrospray, ionization, ion, mobility, spectrometry, mass, spectrometry, ims, ms, or, imms, is, a, technique, where, ions, are, first, separated, by, drift, time, through, some, neutral, gas, under, an, applied, electrical, potential, gradient, before, being, introduced, into, a, mass, spectrometer, drift, time, is, a, measure, of, the, collisional, cross, section, relative, to, the, charge, of, the, ion, the, duty, cycle, of, ims, the, time, over, which, the, experiment, takes, place, is, longer, than, most, mass, spectrometric, techniques, such, that, the, mass, spectrometer, can, sample, along, the, course, of, the, ims, separation, this, produces, data, about, the, ims, separation, and, the, mass, to, charge, ratio, of, the, ions, in, a, manner, similar, to, lc, ms, the, duty, cycle, of, ims, is, short, relative, to, liquid, chromatography, or, gas, chromatography, separations, and, can, thus, be, coupled, to, such, techniques, producing, triple, modalities, such, as, lc, ims, ms, mass, spectrometry, produces, various, types, of, data, the, most, common, data, representation, is, the, mass, spectrum, certain, types, of, mass, spectrometry, data, are, best, represented, as, a, mass, chromatogram, types, of, chromatograms, include, selected, ion, monitoring, sim, total, ion, current, tic, and, selected, reaction, monitoring, srm, among, many, others, other, types, of, mass, spectrometry, data, are, well, represented, as, a, three, dimensional, contour, map, in, this, form, the, mass, to, charge, m, z, is, on, the, x, axis, intensity, the, y, axis, and, an, additional, experimental, parameter, such, as, time, is, recorded, on, the, z, axis, mass, spectrometry, data, analysis, is, specific, to, the, type, of, experiment, producing, the, data, general, subdivisions, of, data, are, fundamental, to, understanding, any, data, many, mass, spectrometers, work, in, either, negative, ion, mode, or, positive, ion, mode, it, is, very, important, to, know, whether, the, observed, ions, are, negatively, or, positively, charged, this, is, often, important, in, determining, the, neutral, mass, but, it, also, indicates, something, about, the, nature, of, the, molecules, different, types, of, ion, source, result, in, different, arrays, of, fragments, produced, from, the, original, molecules, an, electron, ionization, source, produces, many, fragments, and, mostly, single, charged, 1, radicals, odd, number, of, electrons, whereas, an, electrospray, source, usually, produces, non, radical, quasimolecular, ions, that, are, frequently, multiply, charged, tandem, mass, spectrometry, purposely, produces, fragment, ions, post, source, and, can, drastically, change, the, sort, of, data, achieved, by, an, experiment, knowledge, of, the, origin, of, a, sample, can, provide, insight, into, the, component, molecules, of, the, sample, and, their, fragmentations, a, sample, from, a, synthesis, manufacturing, process, will, probably, contain, impurities, chemically, related, to, the, target, component, a, crudely, prepared, biological, sample, will, probably, contain, a, certain, amount, of, salt, which, may, form, adducts, with, the, analyte, molecules, in, certain, analyses, results, can, also, depend, heavily, on, sample, preparation, and, how, it, was, run, introduced, an, important, example, is, the, issue, of, which, matrix, is, used, for, maldi, spotting, since, much, of, the, energetics, of, the, desorption, ionization, event, is, controlled, by, the, matrix, rather, than, the, laser, power, sometimes, samples, are, spiked, with, sodium, or, another, ion, carrying, species, to, produce, adducts, rather, than, a, protonated, species, mass, spectrometry, can, measure, molar, mass, molecular, structure, and, sample, purity, each, of, these, questions, requires, a, different, experimental, procedure, therefore, adequate, definition, of, the, experimental, goal, is, a, prerequisite, for, collecting, the, proper, data, and, successfully, interpreting, it, since, the, precise, structure, or, peptide, sequence, of, a, molecule, is, deciphered, through, the, set, of, fragment, masses, the, interpretation, of, mass, spectra, requires, combined, use, of, various, techniques, usually, the, first, strategy, for, identifying, an, unknown, compound, is, to, compare, its, experimental, mass, spectrum, against, a, library, of, mass, spectra, if, no, matches, result, from, the, search, then, manual, interpretation, or, software, assisted, interpretation, of, mass, spectra, must, be, performed, computer, simulation, of, ionization, and, fragmentation, processes, occurring, in, mass, spectrometer, is, the, primary, tool, for, assigning, structure, or, peptide, sequence, to, a, molecule, an, a, priori, structural, information, is, fragmented, in, silico, and, the, resulting, pattern, is, compared, with, observed, spectrum, such, simulation, is, often, supported, by, a, fragmentation, library, that, contains, published, patterns, of, known, decomposition, reactions, software, taking, advantage, of, this, idea, has, been, developed, for, both, small, molecules, and, proteins, analysis, of, mass, spectra, can, also, be, spectra, with, accurate, mass, a, mass, to, charge, ratio, value, m, z, with, only, integer, precision, can, represent, an, immense, number, of, theoretically, possible, ion, structures, however, more, precise, mass, figures, significantly, reduce, the, number, of, candidate, molecular, formulas, a, computer, algorithm, called, formula, generator, calculates, all, molecular, formulas, that, theoretically, fit, a, given, mass, with, specified, tolerance, a, recent, technique, for, structure, elucidation, in, mass, spectrometry, called, precursor, ion, fingerprinting, identifies, individual, pieces, of, structural, information, by, conducting, a, search, of, the, tandem, spectra, of, the, molecule, under, investigation, against, a, library, of, the, product, ion, spectra, of, structurally, characterized, precursor, ions, mass, spectrometry, has, both, qualitative, and, quantitative, uses, these, include, identifying, unknown, compounds, determining, the, isotopic, composition, of, elements, in, a, molecule, and, determining, the, structure, of, a, compound, by, observing, its, fragmentation, other, uses, include, quantifying, the, amount, of, a, compound, in, a, sample, or, studying, the, fundamentals, of, gas, phase, ion, chemistry, the, chemistry, of, ions, and, neutrals, in, a, vacuum, ms, is, now, commonly, used, in, analytical, laboratories, that, study, physical, chemical, or, biological, properties, of, a, great, variety, of, compounds, quantification, can, be, relative, analyzed, relative, to, a, reference, sample, or, absolute, analyzed, using, a, standard, curve, method, as, an, analytical, technique, it, possesses, distinct, advantages, such, as, increased, sensitivity, over, most, other, analytical, techniques, because, the, analyzer, as, a, mass, charge, filter, reduces, background, interference, excellent, specificity, from, characteristic, fragmentation, patterns, to, identify, unknowns, or, confirm, the, presence, of, suspected, compounds, information, about, molecular, weight, information, about, the, isotopic, abundance, of, elements, temporally, resolved, chemical, data, a, few, of, the, disadvantages, of, the, method, is, that, it, often, fails, to, distinguish, between, optical, and, geometrical, isomers, and, the, positions, of, substituent, in, o, m, and, p, positions, in, an, aromatic, ring, also, its, scope, is, limited, in, identifying, hydrocarbons, that, produce, similar, fragmented, ions, mass, spectrometry, is, also, used, to, determine, the, isotopic, composition, of, elements, within, a, sample, differences, in, mass, among, isotopes, of, an, element, are, very, small, and, the, less, abundant, isotopes, of, an, element, are, typically, very, rare, so, a, very, sensitive, instrument, is, required, these, instruments, sometimes, referred, to, as, isotope, ratio, mass, spectrometers, ir, ms, usually, use, a, single, magnet, to, bend, a, beam, of, ionized, particles, towards, a, series, of, faraday, cups, which, convert, particle, impacts, to, electric, current, a, fast, on, line, analysis, of, deuterium, content, of, water, can, be, done, using, flowing, afterglow, mass, spectrometry, fa, ms, probably, the, most, sensitive, and, accurate, mass, spectrometer, for, this, purpose, is, the, accelerator, mass, spectrometer, ams, this, is, because, it, provides, ultimate, sensitivity, capable, of, measuring, individual, atoms, and, measuring, nuclides, with, a, dynamic, range, of, 10, 15, relative, to, the, major, stable, isotope, isotope, ratios, are, important, markers, of, a, variety, of, processes, some, isotope, ratios, are, used, to, determine, the, age, of, materials, for, example, as, in, carbon, dating, labeling, with, stable, isotopes, is, also, used, for, protein, quantification, see, protein, characterization, below, membrane, introduction, mass, spectrometry, combines, the, isotope, ratio, ms, with, a, reaction, chamber, cell, separated, by, a, gas, permeable, membrane, this, method, allows, the, study, of, gases, as, they, evolve, in, solution, this, method, has, been, extensively, used, for, the, study, of, the, production, of, oxygen, by, photosystem, ii, several, techniques, use, ions, created, in, a, dedicated, ion, source, injected, into, a, flow, tube, or, a, drift, tube, selected, ion, flow, tube, sift, ms, and, proton, transfer, reaction, ptr, ms, are, variants, of, chemical, ionization, dedicated, for, trace, gas, analysis, of, air, breath, or, liquid, headspace, using, well, defined, reaction, time, allowing, calculations, of, analyte, concentrations, from, the, known, reaction, kinetics, without, the, need, for, internal, standard, or, calibration, another, technique, with, applications, in, trace, gas, analysis, field, is, secondary, electrospray, ionization, sesi, ms, which, is, a, variant, of, electrospray, ionization, sesi, consist, of, an, electrospray, plume, of, pure, acidified, solvent, that, interacts, with, neutral, vapors, vapor, molecules, get, ionized, at, atmospheric, pressure, when, charge, is, transferred, from, the, ions, formed, in, the, electrospray, to, the, molecules, one, advantage, of, this, approach, is, that, it, is, compatible, with, most, esi, ms, systems, a, residual, gas, analyzer, rga, is, a, small, and, usually, rugged, mass, spectrometer, typically, designed, for, process, control, and, contamination, monitoring, in, vacuum, systems, when, constructed, as, a, quadrupole, mass, analyzer, there, exist, two, implementations, utilizing, either, an, open, ion, source, ois, or, a, closed, ion, source, cis, rgas, may, be, found, in, high, vacuum, applications, such, as, research, chambers, surface, science, setups, accelerators, scanning, microscopes, etc, rgas, are, used, in, most, cases, to, monitor, the, quality, of, the, vacuum, and, easily, detect, minute, traces, of, impurities, in, the, low, pressure, gas, environment, these, impurities, can, be, measured, down, to, 10, 14, displaystyle, 10, 14, torr, levels, possessing, sub, ppm, detectability, in, the, absence, of, background, interferences, an, atom, probe, is, an, instrument, that, combines, time, of, flight, mass, spectrometry, and, field, evaporation, microscopy, to, map, the, location, of, individual, atoms, pharmacokinetics, is, often, studied, using, mass, spectrometry, because, of, the, complex, nature, of, the, matrix, often, blood, or, urine, and, the, need, for, high, sensitivity, to, observe, low, dose, and, long, time, point, data, the, most, common, instrumentation, used, in, this, application, is, lc, ms, with, a, triple, quadrupole, mass, spectrometer, tandem, mass, spectrometry, is, usually, employed, for, added, specificity, standard, curves, and, internal, standards, are, used, for, quantitation, of, usually, a, single, pharmaceutical, in, the, samples, the, samples, represent, different, time, points, as, a, pharmaceutical, is, administered, and, then, metabolized, or, cleared, from, the, body, blank, or, t, 0, samples, taken, before, administration, are, important, in, determining, background, and, ensuring, data, integrity, with, such, complex, sample, matrices, much, attention, is, paid, to, the, linearity, of, the, standard, curve, however, it, is, not, uncommon, to, use, curve, fitting, with, more, complex, functions, such, as, quadratics, since, the, response, of, most, mass, spectrometers, is, less, than, linear, across, large, concentration, ranges, there, is, currently, considerable, interest, in, the, use, of, very, high, sensitivity, mass, spectrometry, for, microdosing, studies, which, are, seen, as, a, promising, alternative, to, animal, experimentation, recent, studies, show, that, secondary, electrospray, ionization, sesi, is, a, powerful, technique, to, monitor, drug, kinetics, via, breath, analysis, because, breath, is, naturally, produced, several, datapoints, can, be, readily, collected, this, allows, for, the, number, of, collected, data, points, to, be, greatly, increased, in, animal, studies, this, approach, sesi, can, reduce, animal, sacrifice, in, humans, sesi, ms, non, invasive, analysis, of, breath, can, help, study, the, kinetics, of, drugs, at, a, personalized, level, mass, spectrometry, is, an, important, method, for, the, characterization, and, sequencing, of, proteins, the, two, primary, methods, for, ionization, of, whole, proteins, are, electrospray, ionization, esi, and, matrix, assisted, laser, desorption, ionization, maldi, in, keeping, with, the, performance, and, mass, range, of, available, mass, spectrometers, two, approaches, are, used, for, characterizing, proteins, in, the, first, intact, proteins, are, ionized, by, either, of, the, two, techniques, described, above, and, then, introduced, to, a, mass, analyzer, this, approach, is, referred, to, as, top, down, strategy, of, protein, analysis, the, top, down, approach, however, is, largely, limited, to, low, throughput, single, protein, studies, in, the, second, proteins, are, enzymatically, digested, into, smaller, peptides, using, proteases, such, as, trypsin, or, pepsin, either, in, solution, or, in, gel, after, electrophoretic, separation, other, proteolytic, agents, are, also, used, the, collection, of, peptide, products, are, often, separated, by, chromatography, prior, to, introduction, to, the, mass, analyzer, when, the, characteristic, pattern, of, peptides, is, used, for, the, identification, of, the, protein, the, method, is, called, peptide, mass, fingerprinting, pmf, if, the, identification, is, performed, using, the, sequence, data, determined, in, tandem, ms, analysis, it, is, called, de, novo, peptide, sequencing, these, procedures, of, protein, analysis, are, also, referred, to, as, the, bottom, up, approach, and, have, also, been, used, to, analyse, the, distribution, and, position, of, post, translational, modifications, such, as, phosphorylation, on, proteins, a, third, approach, is, also, beginning, to, be, used, this, intermediate, middle, down, approach, involves, analyzing, proteolytic, peptides, that, are, larger, than, the, typical, tryptic, peptide, as, a, standard, method, for, analysis, mass, spectrometers, have, reached, other, planets, and, moons, two, were, taken, to, mars, by, the, viking, program, in, early, 2005, the, cassini, huygens, mission, delivered, a, specialized, gc, ms, instrument, aboard, the, huygens, probe, through, the, atmosphere, of, titan, the, largest, moon, of, the, planet, saturn, this, instrument, analyzed, atmospheric, samples, along, its, descent, trajectory, and, was, able, to, vaporize, and, analyze, samples, of, titan, s, frozen, hydrocarbon, covered, surface, once, the, probe, had, landed, these, measurements, compare, the, abundance, of, isotope, s, of, each, particle, comparatively, to, earth, s, natural, abundance, also, on, board, the, cassini, huygens, spacecraft, was, an, ion, and, neutral, mass, spectrometer, which, had, been, taking, measurements, of, titan, s, atmospheric, composition, as, well, as, the, composition, of, enceladus, plumes, a, thermal, and, evolved, gas, analyzer, mass, spectrometer, was, carried, by, the, mars, phoenix, lander, launched, in, 2007, mass, spectrometers, are, also, widely, used, in, space, missions, to, measure, the, composition, of, plasmas, for, example, the, cassini, spacecraft, carried, the, cassini, plasma, spectrometer, caps, which, measured, the, mass, of, ions, in, saturn, s, magnetosphere, mass, spectrometers, were, used, in, hospitals, for, respiratory, gas, analysis, beginning, around, 1975, through, the, end, of, the, century, some, are, probably, still, in, use, but, none, are, currently, being, manufactured, found, mostly, in, the, operating, room, they, were, a, part, of, a, complex, system, in, which, respired, gas, samples, from, patients, undergoing, anesthesia, were, drawn, into, the, instrument, through, a, valve, mechanism, designed, to, sequentially, connect, up, to, 32, rooms, to, the, mass, spectrometer, a, computer, directed, all, operations, of, the, system, the, data, collected, from, the, mass, spectrometer, was, delivered, to, the, individual, rooms, for, the, anesthesiologist, to, use, the, uniqueness, of, this, magnetic, sector, mass, spectrometer, may, have, been, the, fact, that, a, plane, of, detectors, each, purposely, positioned, to, collect, all, of, the, ion, species, expected, to, be, in, the, samples, allowed, the, instrument, to, simultaneously, report, all, of, the, gases, respired, by, the, patient, although, the, mass, range, was, limited, to, slightly, over, 120, u, fragmentation, of, some, of, the, heavier, molecules, negated, the, need, for, a, higher, detection, limit, the, primary, function, of, mass, spectrometry, is, as, a, tool, for, chemical, analyses, based, on, detection, and, quantification, of, ions, according, to, their, mass, to, charge, ratio, however, mass, spectrometry, also, shows, promise, for, material, synthesis, ion, soft, landing, is, characterized, by, deposition, of, intact, species, on, surfaces, at, low, kinetic, energies, which, precludes, the, fragmentation, of, the, incident, species, the, soft, landing, technique, was, first, reported, in, 1977, for, the, reaction, of, low, energy, sulfur, containing, ions, on, a, lead, surface
