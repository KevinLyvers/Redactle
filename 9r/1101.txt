the, wave, equation, is, a, second, order, linear, partial, differential, equation, for, the, description, of, waves, or, standing, wave, fields, such, as, mechanical, waves, e, g, water, waves, sound, waves, and, seismic, waves, or, electromagnetic, waves, including, light, waves, it, arises, in, fields, like, acoustics, electromagnetism, and, fluid, dynamics, this, article, focuses, on, waves, in, classical, physics, quantum, physics, uses, an, operator, based, wave, equation, often, as, a, relativistic, wave, equation, the, wave, equation, is, a, hyperbolic, partial, differential, equation, describing, waves, including, traveling, and, standing, waves, the, latter, can, be, considered, as, linear, superpositions, of, waves, traveling, in, opposite, directions, this, article, mostly, focuses, on, the, scalar, wave, equation, describing, waves, in, scalars, by, scalar, functions, u, u, x, y, z, t, of, a, time, variable, t, a, variable, representing, time, and, one, or, more, spatial, variables, x, y, z, variables, representing, a, position, in, a, space, under, discussion, at, the, same, time, there, are, vector, wave, equations, describing, waves, in, vectors, such, as, waves, for, an, electrical, field, magnetic, field, and, magnetic, vector, potential, and, elastic, waves, by, comparison, with, vector, wave, equations, the, scalar, wave, equation, can, be, seen, as, a, special, case, of, the, vector, wave, equations, in, the, cartesian, coordinate, system, the, scalar, wave, equation, is, the, equation, to, be, satisfied, by, each, component, for, each, coordinate, axis, such, as, the, x, component, for, the, x, axis, of, a, vector, wave, without, sources, of, waves, in, the, considered, domain, i, e, space, and, time, for, example, in, the, cartesian, coordinate, system, for, e, x, e, y, e, z, displaystyle, e, x, e, y, e, z, as, the, representation, of, an, electric, vector, field, wave, e, displaystyle, vec, e, in, the, absence, of, wave, sources, each, coordinate, axis, component, e, i, displaystyle, e, i, i, x, y, z, must, satisfy, the, scalar, wave, equation, other, scalar, wave, equation, solutions, u, are, for, physical, quantities, in, scalars, such, as, pressure, in, a, liquid, or, gas, or, the, displacement, along, some, specific, direction, of, particles, of, a, vibrating, solid, away, from, their, resting, equilibrium, positions, the, scalar, wave, equation, is, 2, u, t, 2, c, 2, 2, u, x, 2, 2, u, y, 2, 2, u, z, 2, displaystyle, frac, partial, 2, u, partial, t, 2, c, 2, left, frac, partial, 2, u,

u, with, respect, to, time, is, proportional, to, the, sum, of, the, second, derivatives, of, u, displaystyle, u, with, respect, to, space, with, the, constant, of, proportionality, being, the, square, of, the, speed, of, the, wave, using, notations, from, vector, calculus, the, wave, equation, can, be, written, compactly, as, u, t, t, c, 2, u, displaystyle, u, tt, c, 2, delta, u, or, u, 0, displaystyle, box, u, 0, where, the, double, subscript, denotes, the, second, order, partial, derivative, with, respect, to, time, displaystyle, delta, is, the, laplace, operator, and, displaystyle, box, the, d, alembert, operator, defined, as, u, t, t, 2, u, t, 2, 2, x, 2, 2, y, 2, 2, z, 2, 1, c, 2, 2, t, 2, displaystyle, u, tt, frac, partial, 2, u, partial, t, 2, qquad, delta, frac, partial, 2,

can, be, quite, complicated, still, it, can, be, analyzed, as, a, linear, combination, of, simple, solutions, that, are, sinusoidal, plane, waves, with, various, directions, of, propagation, and, wavelengths, but, all, with, the, same, propagation, speed, c, this, analysis, is, possible, because, the, wave, equation, is, linear, and, homogeneous, so, that, any, multiple, of, a, solution, is, also, a, solution, and, the, sum, of, any, two, solutions, is, again, a, solution, this, property, is, called, the, superposition, principle, in, physics, the, wave, equation, alone, does, not, specify, a, physical, solution, a, unique, solution, is, usually, obtained, by, setting, a, problem, with, further, conditions, such, as, initial, conditions, which, prescribe, the, amplitude, and, phase, of, the, wave, another, important, class, of, problems, occurs, in, enclosed, spaces, specified, by, boundary, conditions, for, which, the, solutions, represent, standing, waves, or, harmonics, analogous, to, the, harmonics, of, musical, instruments, the, wave, equation, in, one, spatial, dimension, can, be, written, as, follows, 2, u, t, 2, c, 2, 2, u, x, 2, displaystyle, frac, partial, 2, u, partial, t, 2, c, 2, frac, partial, 2, u, partial, x, 2, this, equation, is, typically, described, as, having, only, one, spatial, dimension, x, because, the, only, other, independent, variable, is, the, time, t, the, wave, equation, in, one, space, dimension, can, be, derived, in, a, variety, of, different, physical, settings, most, famously, it, can, be, derived, for, the, case, of, a, string, vibrating, in, a, two, dimensional, plane, with, each, of, its, elements, being, pulled, in, opposite, directions, by, the, force, of, tension, another, physical, setting, for, derivation, of, the, wave, equation, in, one, space, dimension, uses, hooke, s, law, in, the, theory, of, elasticity, hooke, s, law, is, an, approximation, for, certain, materials, stating, that, the, amount, by, which, a, material, body, is, deformed, the, strain, is, linearly, related, to, the, force, causing, the, deformation, the, stress, the, wave, equation, in, the, one, dimensional, case, can, be, derived, from, hooke, s, law, in, the, following, way, imagine, an, array, of, little, weights, of, mass, m, interconnected, with, massless, springs, of, length, h, the, springs, have, a, spring, constant, of, k, here, the, dependent, variable, u, x, measures, the, distance, from, the, equilibrium, of, the, mass, situated, at, x, so, that, u, x, essentially, measures, the, magnitude, of, a, disturbance, i, e, strain, that, is, traveling, in, an, elastic, material, the, resulting, force, exerted, on, the, mass, m, at, the, location, x, h, is, f, hooke, f, x, 2, h, f, x, k, u, x, 2, h, t,

h, t, displaystyle, begin, aligned, f, text, newton, m, a, t, m, frac, partial, 2, partial, t, 2, u, x, h, t, end, aligned, the, equation, of, motion, for, the, weight, at, the, location, x, h, is, obtained, 2, t, 2, u, x, h, t, k, m, u, x, 2, h, t, u, x, h, t, u, x, h, t, u, x, t, displaystyle, frac, partial, 2, partial, t, 2, u, x, h, t, frac, k, m, if, the, array, of, weights, consists, of, n, weights, spaced, evenly, over, the, length, l, nh, of, total, mass, m, nm, and, the, total, spring, constant, of, the, array, k, k, n, we, can, write, the, above, equation, as, 2, t, 2, u, x, h, t, k, l, 2, m, u, x, 2, h, t, 2, u, x, h, t, u, x, t, h, 2, displaystyle, frac, partial, 2, partial, t, 2, u, x, h, t, frac, kl, 2, m, frac, h, 2, taking, the, limit, n, h, 0, and, assuming, smoothness, one, gets, 2, u, x, t, t, 2, k, l, 2, m, 2, u, x, t, x, 2, displaystyle, frac, partial, 2, u, x, t, partial, t, 2, frac, kl, 2, m, frac, partial, 2, u, x, t, partial, x, 2, which, is, from, the, definition, of, a, second, derivative, kl, 2, m, is, the, square, of, the, propagation, speed, in, this, particular, case, in, the, case, of, a, stress, pulse, propagating, longitudinally, through, a, bar, the, bar, acts, much, like, an, infinite, number, of, springs, in, series, and, can, be, taken, as, an, extension, of, the, equation, derived, for, hooke, s, law, a, uniform, bar, i, e, of, constant, cross, section, made, from, a, linear, elastic, material, has, a, stiffness, k, given, by, k, e, a, l, displaystyle, k, frac, ea, l, where, a, is, the, cross, sectional, area, and, e, is, the, young, s, modulus, of, the, material, the, wave, equation, becomes, 2, u, x, t, t, 2, e, a, l, m, 2, u, x, t, x, 2, displaystyle, frac, partial, 2, u, x, t, partial, t, 2, frac, eal, m, frac, partial, 2, u, x, t, partial, x, 2, al, is, equal, to, the, volume, of, the, bar, and, therefore, a, l, m, 1, displaystyle, frac, al, m, frac, 1, rho, where, is, the, density, of, the, material, the, wave, equation, reduces, to, 2, u, x, t, t, 2, e, 2, u, x, t, x, 2, displaystyle, frac, partial, 2, u, x, t, partial, t, 2, frac, e, rho, frac, partial, 2, u, x, t, partial, x, 2, the, speed, of, a, stress, wave, in, a, bar, is, therefore, e, displaystyle, sqrt, e, rho, for, the, one, dimensional, wave, equation, a, relatively, simple, general, solution, may, be, found, defining, new, variables, x, c, t, x, c, t, displaystyle, begin, aligned, xi, x, ct, eta, x, ct, end, aligned, changes, the, wave, equation, into, 2, u, x, t, 0, displaystyle, frac, partial, 2, u, partial, xi, partial, eta, x, t, 0, which, leads, to, the, general, solution, u, x, t, f, g, f, x, c, t, g, x, c, t, displaystyle, u, x, t, f, xi, g, eta, f, x, ct, g, x, ct, in, other, words, the, solution, is, the, sum, of, a, right, traveling, function, f, and, a, left, traveling, function, g, traveling, means, that, the, shape, of, these, individual, arbitrary, functions, with, respect, to, x, stays, constant, however, the, functions, are, translated, left, and, right, with, time, at, the, speed, c, this, was, derived, by, jean, le, rond, d, alembert, another, way, to, arrive, at, this, result, is, to, factor, the, wave, equation, using, two, first, order, differential, operators, t, c, x, t, c, x, u, 0, displaystyle, left, left, u, 0, then, for, our, original, equation, we, can, define, v, u, t, c, u, x, displaystyle, v, equiv, frac, partial, u, partial, t, c, frac, partial, u, partial, x, and, find, that, we, must, have, v, t, c, v, x, 0, displaystyle, frac, partial, v, partial, t, c, frac, partial, v, partial, x, 0, this, advection, equation, can, be, solved, by, interpreting, it, as, telling, us, that, the, directional, derivative, of, v, in, the, 1, c, direction, is, 0, this, means, that, the, value, of, v, is, constant, on, characteristic, lines, of, the, form, x, ct, x, 0, and, thus, that, v, must, depend, only, on, x, ct, that, is, have, the, form, h, x, ct, then, to, solve, the, first, inhomogenous, equation, relating, v, to, u, we, can, note, that, its, homogenous, solution, must, be, a, function, of, the, form, f, x, ct, by, logic, similar, to, the, above, guessing, a, particular, solution, of, the, form, g, x, ct, we, find, that, t, c, x, g, x, c, t, h, x, c, t, displaystyle, left, g, x, ct, h, x, ct, expanding, out, the, left, side, rearranging, terms, then, using, the, change, of, variables, s, x, ct, simplifies, the, equation, to, g, s, h, s, 2, c, displaystyle, g, s, frac, h, s, 2c, this, means, we, can, find, a, particular, solution, g, of, the, desired, form, by, integration, thus, we, have, again, shown, that, u, obeys, u, x, t, f, x, ct, g, x, ct, for, an, initial, value, problem, the, arbitrary, functions, f, and, g, can, be, determined, to, satisfy, initial, conditions, u, x, 0, f, x, displaystyle, u, x, 0, f, x, u, t, x, 0, g, x, displaystyle, u, t, x, 0, g, x, the, result, is, d, alembert, s, formula, u, x, t, f, x, c, t, f, x, c, t, 2, 1, 2, c, x, c, t, x, c, t, g, s, d, s, displaystyle, u, x, t, frac, f, x, ct, f, x, ct, 2, frac, 1, 2c, int, x, ct, x, ct, g, s, ds, in, the, classical, sense, if, f, x, c, k, and, g, x, c, k, 1, then, u, t, x, c, k, however, the, waveforms, f, and, g, may, also, be, generalized, functions, such, as, the, delta, function, in, that, case, the, solution, may, be, interpreted, as, an, impulse, that, travels, to, the, right, or, the, left, the, basic, wave, equation, is, a, linear, differential, equation, and, so, it, will, adhere, to, the, superposition, principle, this, means, that, the, net, displacement, caused, by, two, or, more, waves, is, the, sum, of, the, displacements, which, would, have, been, caused, by, each, wave, individually, in, addition, the, behavior, of, a, wave, can, be, analyzed, by, breaking, up, the, wave, into, components, e, g, the, fourier, transform, breaks, up, a, wave, into, sinusoidal, components, another, way, to, solve, the, one, dimensional, wave, equation, is, to, first, analyze, its, frequency, eigenmodes, a, so, called, eigenmode, is, a, solution, that, oscillates, in, time, with, a, well, defined, constant, angular, frequency, so, that, the, temporal, part, of, the, wave, function, takes, the, form, e, i, t, cos, t, i, sin, t, and, the, amplitude, is, a, function, f, x, of, the, spatial, variable, x, giving, a, separation, of, variables, for, the, wave, function, u, x, t, e, i, t, f, x, displaystyle, u, omega, x, t, e, i, omega, t, f, x, this, produces, an, ordinary, differential, equation, for, the, spatial, part, f, x, 2, u, t, 2, 2, t, 2, e, i, t, f, x, 2, e, i, t, f, x, c, 2, 2, x, 2, e, i, t, f, x, displaystyle, frac, partial, 2, u, omega, partial, t, 2, frac, partial, 2, partial, t, 2, left, e, i, omega, t, f, x, right, omega, 2, e, i, omega, t, f, x, c, 2, frac, partial, 2, partial, x, 2, left, e, i, omega, t, f, x, right, therefore, d, 2, d, x, 2, f, x, c, 2, f, x, displaystyle, frac, d, 2, dx, 2, f, x, left, frac, omega, c, right, 2, f, x, which, is, precisely, an, eigenvalue, equation, for, f, x, hence, the, name, eigenmode, known, as, the, helmholtz, equation, it, has, the, well, known, plane, wave, solutions, f, x, a, e, i, k, x, displaystyle, f, x, ae, pm, ikx, with, wave, number, k, c, the, total, wave, function, for, this, eigenmode, is, then, the, linear, combination, u, x, t, e, i, t, a, e, i, k, x, b, e, i, k, x, a, e, i, k, x, t, b, e, i, k, x, t, displaystyle, u, omega, x, t, e, i, omega, t, left, ae, ikx, be, ikx, right, ae, i, kx, omega, t, be, i, kx, omega, t, where, complex, numbers, a, b, depend, in, general, on, any, initial, and, boundary, conditions, of, the, problem, eigenmodes, are, useful, in, constructing, a, full, solution, to, the, wave, equation, because, each, of, them, evolves, in, time, trivially, with, the, phase, factor, e, i, t, displaystyle, e, i, omega, t, so, that, a, full, solution, can, be, decomposed, into, an, eigenmode, expansion, u, x, t, s, u, x, t, d, displaystyle, u, x, t, int, infty, infty, s, omega, u, omega, x, t, d, omega, or, in, terms, of, the, plane, waves, u, x, t, s, e, i, k, x, t, d, s, e, i, k, x, t, d, s, e, i, k, x, c, t,

algebraic, approach, functions, s, are, known, as, the, fourier, component, and, are, determined, by, initial, and, boundary, conditions, this, is, a, so, called, frequency, domain, method, alternative, to, direct, time, domain, propagations, such, as, fdtd, method, of, the, wave, packet, u, x, t, which, is, complete, for, representing, waves, in, absence, of, time, dilations, completeness, of, the, fourier, expansion, for, representing, waves, in, the, presence, of, time, dilations, has, been, challenged, by, chirp, wave, solutions, allowing, for, time, variation, of, the, chirp, wave, solutions, seem, particularly, implied, by, very, large, but, previously, inexplicable, radar, residuals, in, the, flyby, anomaly, and, differ, from, the, sinusoidal, solutions, in, being, receivable, at, any, distance, only, at, proportionally, shifted, frequencies, and, time, dilations, corresponding, to, past, chirp, states, of, the, source, the, vectorial, wave, equation,
