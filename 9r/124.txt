the, milky, way, is, the, galaxy, that, includes, the, solar, system, with, the, name, describing, the, galaxy, s, appearance, from, earth, a, hazy, band, of, light, seen, in, the, night, sky, formed, from, stars, that, cannot, be, individually, distinguished, by, the, naked, eye, the, milky, way, is, a, barred, spiral, galaxy, with, a, d, 25, isophotal, diameter, estimated, at, 26, 8, 1, 1, kiloparsecs, 87, 400, 3, 600, light, years, but, only, about, 1, 000, light, years, thick, at, the, spiral, arms, more, at, the, bulge, recent, simulations, suggest, that, a, dark, matter, area, also, containing, some, visible, stars, may, extend, up, to, a, diameter, of, almost, 2, million, light, years, 613, kpc, the, milky, way, has, several, satellite, galaxies, and, is, part, of, the, local, group, of, galaxies, which, form, part, of, the, virgo, supercluster, which, is, itself, a, component, of, the, laniakea, supercluster, it, is, estimated, to, contain, 100, 400, billion, stars, and, at, least, that, number, of, planets, the, solar, system, is, located, at, a, radius, of, about, 27, 000, light, years, 8, 3, kpc, from, the, galactic, center, on, the, inner, edge, of, the, orion, arm, one, of, the, spiral, shaped, concentrations, of, gas, and, dust, the, stars, in, the, innermost, 10, 000, light, years, form, a, bulge, and, one, or, more, bars, that, radiate, from, the, bulge, the, galactic, center, is, an, intense, radio, source, known, as, sagittarius, a, a, supermassive, black, hole, of, 4, 100, 0, 034, million, solar, masses, the, oldest, stars, in, the, milky, way, are, nearly, as, old, as, the, universe, itself, and, thus, probably, formed, shortly, after, the, dark, ages, of, the, big, bang, galileo, galilei, first, resolved, the, band, of, light, into, individual, stars, with, his, telescope, in, 1610, until, the, early, 1920s, most, astronomers, thought, that, the, milky, way, contained, all, the, stars, in, the, universe, following, the, 1920, great, debate, between, the, astronomers, harlow, shapley, and, heber, doust, curtis, observations, by, edwin, hubble, showed, that, the, milky, way, is, just, one, of, many, galaxies, in, the, babylonian, epic, poem, en, ma, eli, the, milky, way, is, created, from, the, severed, tail, of, the, primeval, salt, water, dragoness, tiamat, set, in, the, sky, by, marduk, the, babylonian, national, god, after, slaying, her, this, story, was, once, thought, to, have, been, based, on, an, older, sumerian, version, in, which, tiamat, is, instead, slain, by, enlil, of, nippur, but, is, now, thought, to, be, purely, an, invention, of, babylonian, propagandists, with, the, intention, to, show, marduk, as, superior, to, the, sumerian, deities, in, greek, mythology, zeus, places, his, son, born, by, a, mortal, woman, the, infant, heracles, on, hera, s, breast, while, she, is, asleep, so, the, baby, will, drink, her, divine, milk, and, become, immortal, hera, wakes, up, while, breastfeeding, and, then, realizes, she, is, nursing, an, unknown, baby, she, pushes, the, baby, away, some, of, her, milk, spills, and, it, produces, the, band, of, light, known, as, the, milky, way, in, another, greek, story, the, abandoned, heracles, is, given, by, athena, to, hera, for, feeding, but, heracles, forcefulness, causes, hera, to, rip, him, from, her, breast, in, pain, llys, d, n, literally, the, court, of, d, n, is, the, traditional, welsh, name, for, the, constellation, cassiopeia, at, least, three, of, d, n, s, children, also, have, astronomical, associations, caer, gwydion, the, fortress, of, gwydion, is, the, traditional, welsh, name, for, the, milky, way, and, caer, arianrhod, the, fortress, of, arianrhod, being, the, constellation, of, corona, borealis, in, western, culture, the, name, milky, way, is, derived, from, its, appearance, as, a, dim, un, resolved, milky, glowing, band, arching, across, the, night, sky, the, term, is, a, translation, of, the, classical, latin, via, lactea, in, turn, derived, from, the, hellenistic, greek, short, for, galax, as, k, klos, meaning, milky, circle, the, ancient, greek, galaxias, from, root, milk, forming, adjectives, is, also, the, root, of, galaxy, the, name, for, our, and, later, all, such, collections, of, stars, the, milky, way, or, milk, circle, was, just, one, of, 11, circles, the, greeks, identified, in, the, sky, others, being, the, zodiac, the, meridian, the, horizon, the, equator, the, tropics, of, cancer, and, capricorn, the, arctic, circle, and, the, antarctic, circle, and, two, colure, circles, passing, through, both, poles, the, milky, way, is, visible, as, a, hazy, band, of, white, light, some, 30, wide, arching, the, night, sky, although, all, the, individual, naked, eye, stars, in, the, entire, sky, are, part, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, the, term, milky, way, is, limited, to, this, band, of, light, the, light, originates, from, the, accumulation, of, unresolved, stars, and, other, material, located, in, the, direction, of, the, galactic, plane, brighter, regions, around, the, band, appear, as, soft, visual, patches, known, as, star, clouds, the, most, conspicuous, of, these, is, the, large, sagittarius, star, cloud, a, portion, of, the, central, bulge, of, the, galaxy, dark, regions, within, the, band, such, as, the, great, rift, and, the, coalsack, are, areas, where, interstellar, dust, blocks, light, from, distant, stars, peoples, of, the, southern, hemisphere, including, the, inca, and, australian, aborigines, identified, these, regions, as, dark, cloud, constellations, the, area, of, sky, that, the, milky, way, obscures, is, called, the, zone, of, avoidance, the, milky, way, has, a, relatively, low, surface, brightness, its, visibility, can, be, greatly, reduced, by, background, light, such, as, light, pollution, or, moonlight, the, sky, needs, to, be, darker, than, about, 20, 2, magnitude, per, square, arcsecond, in, order, for, the, milky, way, to, be, visible, it, should, be, visible, if, the, limiting, magnitude, is, approximately, 5, 1, or, better, and, shows, a, great, deal, of, detail, at, 6, 1, this, makes, the, milky, way, difficult, to, see, from, brightly, lit, urban, or, suburban, areas, but, very, prominent, when, viewed, from, rural, areas, when, the, moon, is, below, the, horizon, maps, of, artificial, night, sky, brightness, show, that, more, than, one, third, of, earth, s, population, cannot, see, the, milky, way, from, their, homes, due, to, light, pollution, as, viewed, from, earth, the, visible, region, of, the, milky, way, s, galactic, plane, occupies, an, area, of, the, sky, that, includes, 30, constellations, the, galactic, center, lies, in, the, direction, of, sagittarius, where, the, milky, way, is, brightest, from, sagittarius, the, hazy, band, of, white, light, appears, to, pass, around, to, the, galactic, anticenter, in, auriga, the, band, then, continues, the, rest, of, the, way, around, the, sky, back, to, sagittarius, dividing, the, sky, into, two, roughly, equal, hemispheres, the, galactic, plane, is, inclined, by, about, 60, to, the, ecliptic, the, plane, of, earth, s, orbit, relative, to, the, celestial, equator, it, passes, as, far, north, as, the, constellation, of, cassiopeia, and, as, far, south, as, the, constellation, of, crux, indicating, the, high, inclination, of, earth, s, equatorial, plane, and, the, plane, of, the, ecliptic, relative, to, the, galactic, plane, the, north, galactic, pole, is, situated, at, right, ascension, 12, h, 49, m, declination, 27, 4, b1950, near, comae, berenices, and, the, south, galactic, pole, is, near, sculptoris, because, of, this, high, inclination, depending, on, the, time, of, night, and, year, the, milky, way, arch, may, appear, relatively, low, or, relatively, high, in, the, sky, for, observers, from, latitudes, approximately, 65, north, to, 65, south, the, milky, way, passes, directly, overhead, twice, a, day, in, meteorologica, aristotle, 384, 322, bc, states, that, the, greek, philosophers, anaxagoras, c, 500, 428, bc, and, democritus, 460, 370, bc, proposed, that, the, milky, way, is, the, glow, of, stars, not, directly, visible, due, to, earth, s, shadow, while, other, stars, receive, their, light, from, the, sun, but, have, their, glow, obscured, by, solar, rays, aristotle, himself, believed, that, the, milky, way, was, part, of, the, earth, s, upper, atmosphere, along, with, the, stars, and, that, it, was, a, byproduct, of, stars, burning, that, did, not, dissipate, because, of, its, outermost, location, in, the, atmosphere, composing, its, great, circle, he, said, that, the, milky, appearance, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, is, due, to, the, refraction, of, the, earth, s, atmosphere, the, neoplatonist, philosopher, olympiodorus, the, younger, c, 495, 570, ad, criticized, this, view, arguing, that, if, the, milky, way, were, sublunary, it, should, appear, different, at, different, times, and, places, on, earth, and, that, it, should, have, parallax, which, it, does, not, in, his, view, the, milky, way, is, celestial, this, idea, would, be, influential, later, in, the, muslim, world, the, persian, astronomer, al, biruni, 973, 1048, proposed, that, the, milky, way, is, a, collection, of, countless, fragments, of, the, nature, of, nebulous, stars, the, andalusian, astronomer, avempace, d, 1138, proposed, that, the, milky, way, was, made, up, of, many, stars, but, appeared, to, be, a, continuous, image, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, citing, his, observation, of, a, conjunction, of, jupiter, and, mars, in, 1106, or, 1107, as, evidence, the, persian, astronomer, nasir, al, din, al, tusi, 1201, 1274, in, his, tadhkira, wrote, the, milky, way, i, e, the, galaxy, is, made, up, of, a, very, large, number, of, small, tightly, clustered, stars, which, on, account, of, their, concentration, and, smallness, seem, to, be, cloudy, patches, because, of, this, it, was, likened, to, milk, in, color, ibn, qayyim, al, jawziyya, 1292, 1350, proposed, that, the, milky, way, is, a, myriad, of, tiny, stars, packed, together, in, the, sphere, of, the, fixed, stars, proof, of, the, milky, way, consisting, of, many, stars, came, in, 1610, when, galileo, galilei, used, a, telescope, to, study, the, milky, way, and, discovered, that, it, is, composed, of, a, huge, number, of, faint, stars, galileo, also, concluded, that, the, appearance, of, the, milky, way, was, due, to, refraction, of, the, earth, s, atmosphere, in, a, treatise, in, 1755, immanuel, kant, drawing, on, earlier, work, by, thomas, wright, speculated, correctly, that, the, milky, way, might, be, a, rotating, body, of, a, huge, number, of, stars, held, together, by, gravitational, forces, akin, to, the, solar, system, but, on, much, larger, scales, the, resulting, disk, of, stars, would, be, seen, as, a, band, on, the, sky, from, our, perspective, inside, the, disk, wright, and, kant, also, conjectured, that, some, of, the, nebulae, visible, in, the, night, sky, might, be, separate, galaxies, themselves, similar, to, our, own, kant, referred, to, both, the, milky, way, and, the, extragalactic, nebulae, as, island, universes, a, term, still, current, up, to, the, 1930s, the, first, attempt, to, describe, the, shape, of, the, milky, way, and, the, position, of, the, sun, within, it, was, carried, out, by, william, herschel, in, 1785, by, carefully, counting, the, number, of, stars, in, different, regions, of, the, visible, sky, he, produced, a, diagram, of, the, shape, of, the, milky, way, with, the, solar, system, close, to, the, center, in, 1845, lord, rosse, constructed, a, new, telescope, and, was, able, to, distinguish, between, elliptical, and, spiral, shaped, nebulae, he, also, managed, to, make, out, individual, point, sources, in, some, of, these, nebulae, lending, credence, to, kant, s, earlier, conjecture, in, 1904, studying, the, proper, motions, of, stars, jacobus, kapteyn, reported, that, these, were, not, random, as, it, was, believed, in, that, time, stars, could, be, divided, into, two, streams, moving, in, nearly, opposite, directions, it, was, later, realized, that, kapteyn, s, data, had, been, the, first, evidence, of, the, rotation, of, our, galaxy, which, ultimately, led, to, the, finding, of, galactic, rotation, by, bertil, lindblad, and, jan, oort, in, 1917, heber, doust, curtis, had, observed, the, nova, s, andromedae, within, the, great, andromeda, nebula, messier, object, 31, searching, the, photographic, record, he, found, 11, more, novae, curtis, noticed, that, these, novae, were, on, average, 10, magnitudes, fainter, than, those, that, occurred, within, the, milky, way, as, a, result, he, was, able, to, come, up, with, a, distance, estimate, of, 150, 000, parsecs, he, became, a, proponent, of, the, island, universes, hypothesis, which, held, that, the, spiral, nebulae, were, independent, galaxies, in, 1920, the, great, debate, took, place, between, harlow, shapley, and, heber, curtis, concerning, the, nature, of, the, milky, way, spiral, nebulae, and, the, dimensions, of, the, universe, to, support, his, claim, that, the, great, andromeda, nebula, is, an, external, galaxy, curtis, noted, the, appearance, of, dark, lanes, resembling, the, dust, clouds, in, the, milky, way, as, well, as, the, significant, doppler, shift, the, controversy, was, conclusively, settled, by, edwin, hubble, in, the, early, 1920s, using, the, mount, wilson, observatory, 2, 5, m, 100, in, hooker, telescope, with, the, light, gathering, power, of, this, new, telescope, he, was, able, to, produce, astronomical, photographs, that, resolved, the, outer, parts, of, some, spiral, nebulae, as, collections, of, individual, stars, he, was, also, able, to, identify, some, cepheid, variables, that, he, could, use, as, a, benchmark, to, estimate, the, distance, to, the, nebulae, he, found, that, the, andromeda, nebula, is, 275, 000, parsecs, from, the, sun, far, too, distant, to, be, part, of, the, milky, way, the, esa, spacecraft, gaia, provides, distance, estimates, by, determining, the, parallax, of, a, billion, stars, and, is, mapping, the, milky, way, with, four, planned, releases, of, maps, in, 2016, 2018, 2021, and, 2024, data, from, gaia, has, been, described, as, transformational, it, has, been, estimated, that, gaia, has, expanded, the, number, of, observations, of, stars, from, about, 2, million, stars, as, of, the, 1990s, to, 2, billion, it, has, expanded, the, measurable, volume, of, space, by, a, factor, of, 100, in, radius, and, a, factor, of, 1, 000, in, precision, a, study, in, 2020, concluded, that, gaia, detected, a, wobbling, motion, of, the, galaxy, which, might, be, caused, by, torques, from, a, misalignment, of, the, disc, s, rotation, axis, with, respect, to, the, principal, axis, of, a, non, spherical, halo, or, from, accreted, matter, in, the, halo, acquired, during, late, infall, or, from, nearby, interacting, satellite, galaxies, and, their, consequent, tides, in, april, 2024, initial, studies, and, related, maps, involving, the, magnetic, fields, of, the, milky, way, were, reported, the, sun, is, near, the, inner, rim, of, the, orion, arm, within, the, local, fluff, of, the, local, bubble, between, the, radcliffe, wave, and, split, linear, structures, formerly, gould, belt, based, upon, studies, of, stellar, orbits, around, sgr, a, by, gillessen, et, al, 2016, the, sun, lies, at, an, estimated, distance, of, 27, 14, 0, 46, kly, 8, 32, 0, 14, kpc, from, the, galactic, center, boehle, et, al, 2016, found, a, smaller, value, of, 25, 64, 0, 46, kly, 7, 86, 0, 14, kpc, also, using, a, star, orbit, analysis, the, sun, is, currently, 5, 30, parsecs, 16, 98, ly, above, or, north, of, the, central, plane, of, the, galactic, disk, the, distance, between, the, local, arm, and, the, next, arm, out, the, perseus, arm, is, about, 2, 000, parsecs, 6, 500, ly, the, sun, and, thus, the, solar, system, is, located, in, the, milky, way, s, galactic, habitable, zone, there, are, about, 208, stars, brighter, than, absolute, magnitude, 8, 5, within, a, sphere, with, a, radius, of, 15, parsecs, 49, ly, from, the, sun, giving, a, density, of, one, star, per, 69, cubic, parsecs, or, one, star, per, 2, 360, cubic, light, years, from, list, of, nearest, bright, stars, on, the, other, hand, there, are, 64, known, stars, of, any, magnitude, not, counting, 4, brown, dwarfs, within, 5, parsecs, 16, ly, of, the, sun, giving, a, density, of, about, one, star, per, 8, 2, cubic, parsecs, or, one, per, 284, cubic, light, years, from, list, of, nearest, stars, this, illustrates, the, fact, that, there, are, far, more, faint, stars, than, bright, stars, in, the, entire, sky, there, are, about, 500, stars, brighter, than, apparent, magnitude, 4, but, 15, 5, million, stars, brighter, than, apparent, magnitude, 14, the, apex, of, the, sun, s, way, or, the, solar, apex, is, the, direction, that, the, sun, travels, through, space, in, the, milky, way, the, general, direction, of, the, sun, s, galactic, motion, is, towards, the, star, vega, near, the, constellation, of, hercules, at, an, angle, of, roughly, 60, sky, degrees, to, the, direction, of, the, galactic, center, the, sun, s, orbit, about, the, milky, way, is, expected, to, be, roughly, elliptical, with, the, addition, of, perturbations, due, to, the, galactic, spiral, arms, and, non, uniform, mass, distributions, in, addition, the, sun, passes, through, the, galactic, plane, approximately, 2, 7, times, per, orbit, this, is, very, similar, to, how, a, simple, harmonic, oscillator, works, with, no, drag, force, damping, term, these, oscillations, were, until, recently, thought, to, coincide, with, mass, lifeform, extinction, periods, on, earth, a, reanalysis, of, the, effects, of, the, sun, s, transit, through, the, spiral, structure, based, on, co, data, has, failed, to, find, a, correlation, it, takes, the, solar, system, about, 240, million, years, to, complete, one, orbit, of, the, milky, way, a, galactic, year, so, the, sun, is, thought, to, have, completed, 18, 20, orbits, during, its, lifetime, and, 1, 1250, of, a, revolution, since, the, origin, of, humans, the, orbital, speed, of, the, solar, system, about, the, center, of, the, milky, way, is, approximately, 220, km, s, 490, 000, mph, or, 0, 073, of, the, speed, of, light, the, sun, moves, through, the, heliosphere, at, 84, 000, km, h, 52, 000, mph, at, this, speed, it, takes, around, 1, 400, years, for, the, solar, system, to, travel, a, distance, of, 1, light, year, or, 8, days, to, travel, 1, au, astronomical, unit, the, solar, system, is, headed, in, the, direction, of, the, zodiacal, constellation, scorpius, which, follows, the, ecliptic, a, galactic, quadrant, or, quadrant, of, the, milky, way, refers, to, one, of, four, circular, sectors, in, the, division, of, the, milky, way, in, astronomical, practice, the, delineation, of, the, galactic, quadrants, is, based, upon, the, galactic, coordinate, system, which, places, the, sun, as, the, origin, of, the, mapping, system, quadrants, are, described, using, ordinals, for, example, 1st, galactic, quadrant, second, galactic, quadrant, or, third, quadrant, of, the, milky, way, viewing, from, the, north, galactic, pole, with, 0, zero, degrees, as, the, ray, that, runs, starting, from, the, sun, and, through, the, galactic, center, the, quadrants, are, with, the, galactic, longitude, increasing, in, the, counter, clockwise, direction, positive, rotation, as, viewed, from, north, of, the, galactic, center, a, view, point, several, hundred, thousand, light, years, distant, from, earth, in, the, direction, of, the, constellation, coma, berenices, if, viewed, from, south, of, the, galactic, center, a, view, point, similarly, distant, in, the, constellation, sculptor, would, increase, in, the, clockwise, direction, negative, rotation, the, milky, way, is, one, of, the, two, largest, galaxies, in, the, local, group, the, other, being, the, andromeda, galaxy, although, the, size, for, its, galactic, disc, and, how, much, it, defines, the, isophotal, diameter, is, not, well, understood, it, is, estimated, that, the, significant, bulk, of, stars, in, the, galaxy, lies, within, the, 26, kiloparsecs, 80, 000, light, years, diameter, and, that, the, number, of, stars, beyond, the, outermost, disc, dramatically, reduces, to, a, very, low, number, with, respect, to, an, extrapolation, of, the, exponential, disk, with, the, scale, length, of, the, inner, disc, there, are, several, methods, being, used, in, astronomy, in, defining, the, size, of, a, galaxy, and, each, of, them, can, yield, different, results, with, respect, to, one, another, the, most, commonly, employed, method, is, the, d, 25, standard, the, isophote, where, the, photometric, brightness, of, a, galaxy, in, the, b, band, 445, nm, wavelength, of, light, in, the, blue, part, of, the, visible, spectrum, reaches, 25, mag, arcsec, 2, an, estimate, from, 1997, by, goodwin, and, others, compared, the, distribution, of, cepheid, variable, stars, in, 17, other, spiral, galaxies, to, the, ones, in, the, milky, way, and, modelling, the, relationship, to, their, surface, brightnesses, this, gave, an, isophotal, diameter, for, the, milky, way, at, 26, 8, 1, 1, kiloparsecs, 87, 400, 3, 600, light, years, by, assuming, that, the, galactic, disc, is, well, represented, by, an, exponential, disc, and, adopting, a, central, surface, brightness, of, the, galaxy, 0, of, 22, 1, 0, 3, b, mag, arcsec, 2, and, a, disk, scale, length, h, of, 5, 0, 0, 5, kpc, 16, 300, 1, 600, ly, this, is, significantly, smaller, than, the, andromeda, galaxy, s, isophotal, diameter, and, slightly, below, the, mean, isophotal, sizes, of, the, galaxies, being, at, 28, 3, kpc, 92, 000, ly, the, paper, concludes, that, the, milky, way, and, andromeda, galaxy, were, not, overly, large, spiral, galaxies, nor, were, among, the, largest, known, if, the, former, not, being, the, largest, as, previously, widely, believed, but, rather, average, ordinary, spiral, galaxies, to, compare, the, relative, physical, scale, of, the, milky, way, if, the, solar, system, out, to, neptune, were, the, size, of, a, us, quarter, 24, 3, mm, 0, 955, in, the, milky, way, would, be, approximately, at, least, the, greatest, north, south, line, of, the, contiguous, united, states, an, even, older, study, from, 1978, gave, a, lower, diameter, for, milky, way, about, 23, kpc, 75, 000, ly, a, 2015, paper, discovered, that, there, is, a, ring, like, filament, of, stars, called, triangulum, andromeda, ring, triand, ring, rippling, above, and, below, the, relatively, flat, galactic, plane, which, alongside, monoceros, ring, were, both, suggested, to, be, primarily, the, result, of, disk, oscillations, and, wrapping, around, the, milky, way, at, a, diameter, of, at, least, 50, kpc, 160, 000, ly, which, may, be, part, of, the, milky, way, s, outer, disk, itself, hence, making, the, stellar, disk, larger, by, increasing, to, this, size, a, more, recent, 2018, paper, later, somewhat, ruled, out, this, hypothesis, and, supported, a, conclusion, that, the, monoceros, ring, a13, and, triand, ring, were, stellar, overdensities, rather, kicked, out, from, the, main, stellar, disk, with, the, velocity, dispersion, of, the, rr, lyrae, stars, found, to, be, higher, and, consistent, with, halo, membership, another, 2018, study, revealed, the, very, probable, presence, of, disk, stars, at, 26, 31, 5, kpc, 84, 800, 103, 000, ly, from, the, galactic, center, or, perhaps, even, farther, significantly, beyond, approximately, 13, 20, kpc, 40, 000, 70, 000, ly, in, which, it, was, once, believed, to, be, the, abrupt, drop, off, of, the, stellar, density, of, the, disk, meaning, that, few, or, no, stars, were, expected, to, be, above, this, limit, save, for, stars, that, belong, to, the, old, population, of, the, galactic, halo, a, 2020, study, predicted, the, edge, of, the, milky, way, s, dark, matter, halo, being, around, 292, 61, kpc, 952, 000, 199, 000, ly, which, translates, to, a, diameter, of, 584, 122, kpc, 1, 905, 0, 3979, mly, the, milky, way, s, stellar, disk, is, also, estimated, to, be, approximately, up, to, 1, 35, kpc, 4, 000, ly, thick, the, milky, way, is, approximately, 890, billion, to, 1, 54, trillion, times, the, mass, of, the, sun, in, total, 8, 9, 10, 11, to, 1, 54, 10, 12, solar, masses, although, stars, and, planets, make, up, only, a, small, part, of, this, estimates, of, the, mass, of, the, milky, way, vary, depending, upon, the, method, and, data, used, the, low, end, of, the, estimate, range, is, 5, 8, 10, 11, solar, masses, m, somewhat, less, than, that, of, the, andromeda, galaxy, measurements, using, the, very, long, baseline, array, in, 2009, found, velocities, as, large, as, 254, km, s, 570, 000, mph, for, stars, at, the, outer, edge, of, the, milky, way, because, the, orbital, velocity, depends, on, the, total, mass, inside, the, orbital, radius, this, suggests, that, the, milky, way, is, more, massive, roughly, equaling, the, mass, of, andromeda, galaxy, at, 7, 10, 11, m, within, 160, 000, ly, 49, kpc, of, its, center, in, 2010, a, measurement, of, the, radial, velocity, of, halo, stars, found, that, the, mass, enclosed, within, 80, kilo, parsecs, is, 7, 10, 11, m, in, a, 2014, study, the, mass, of, the, entire, milky, way, is, estimated, to, be, 8, 5, 10, 11, m, but, this, is, only, half, the, mass, of, the, andromeda, galaxy, a, recent, 2019, mass, estimate, for, the, milky, way, is, 1, 29, 10, 12, m, much, of, the, mass, of, the, milky, way, seems, to, be, dark, matter, an, unknown, and, invisible, form, of, matter, that, interacts, gravitationally, with, ordinary, matter, a, dark, matter, halo, is, conjectured, to, spread, out, relatively, uniformly, to, a, distance, beyond, one, hundred, kiloparsecs, kpc, from, the, galactic, center, mathematical, models, of, the, milky, way, suggest, that, the, mass, of, dark, matter, is, 1, 1, 5, 10, 12, m, 2013, and, 2014, studies, indicate, a, range, in, mass, as, large, as, 4, 5, 10, 12, m, and, as, small, as, 8, 10, 11, m, by, comparison, the, total, mass, of, all, the, stars, in, the, milky, way, is, estimated, to, be, between, 4, 6, 10, 10, m, and, 6, 43, 10, 10, m, in, addition, to, the, stars, there, is, also, interstellar, gas, comprising, 90, hydrogen, and, 10, helium, by, mass, with, two, thirds, of, the, hydrogen, found, in, the, atomic, form, and, the, remaining, one, third, as, molecular, hydrogen, the, mass, of, the, milky, way, s, interstellar, gas, is, equal, to, between, 10, and, 15, of, the, total, mass, of, its, stars, interstellar, dust, accounts, for, an, additional, 1, of, the, total, mass, of, the, gas, in, march, 2019, astronomers, reported, that, the, virial, mass, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, is, 1, 54, trillion, solar, masses, within, a, radius, of, about, 39, 5, kpc, 130, 000, ly, over, twice, as, much, as, was, determined, in, earlier, studies, suggesting, that, about, 90, of, the, mass, of, the, galaxy, is, dark, matter, in, september, 2023, astronomers, reported, that, the, virial, mass, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, is, only, 2, 06, 10, 11, solar, masses, only, a, 10th, of, the, mass, of, previous, studies, the, mass, was, determined, from, data, of, the, gaia, spacecraft, the, milky, way, contains, between, 100, and, 400, billion, stars, and, at, least, that, many, planets, an, exact, figure, would, depend, on, counting, the, number, of, very, low, mass, stars, which, are, difficult, to, detect, especially, at, distances, of, more, than, 300, ly, 90, pc, from, the, sun, as, a, comparison, the, neighboring, andromeda, galaxy, contains, an, estimated, one, trillion, 10, 12, stars, the, milky, way, may, contain, ten, billion, white, dwarfs, a, billion, neutron, stars, and, a, hundred, million, stellar, black, holes, filling, the, space, between, the, stars, is, a, disk, of, gas, and, dust, called, the, interstellar, medium, this, disk, has, at, least, a, comparable, extent, in, radius, to, the, stars, whereas, the, thickness, of, the, gas, layer, ranges, from, hundreds, of, light, years, for, the, colder, gas, to, thousands, of, light, years, for, warmer, gas, the, disk, of, stars, in, the, milky, way, does, not, have, a, sharp, edge, beyond, which, there, are, no, stars, rather, the, concentration, of, stars, decreases, with, distance, from, the, center, of, the, milky, way, beyond, a, radius, of, roughly, 40, 000, light, years, 13, kpc, from, the, center, the, number, of, stars, per, cubic, parsec, drops, much, faster, with, radius, surrounding, the, galactic, disk, is, a, spherical, galactic, halo, of, stars, and, globular, clusters, that, extends, farther, outward, but, is, limited, in, size, by, the, orbits, of, two, milky, way, satellites, the, large, and, small, magellanic, clouds, whose, closest, approach, to, the, galactic, center, is, about, 180, 000, ly, 55, kpc, at, this, distance, or, beyond, the, orbits, of, most, halo, objects, would, be, disrupted, by, the, magellanic, clouds, hence, such, objects, would, probably, be, ejected, from, the, vicinity, of, the, milky, way, the, integrated, absolute, visual, magnitude, of, the, milky, way, is, estimated, to, be, around, 20, 9, both, gravitational, microlensing, and, planetary, transit, observations, indicate, that, there, may, be, at, least, as, many, planets, bound, to, stars, as, there, are, stars, in, the, milky, way, and, microlensing, measurements, indicate, that, there, are, more, rogue, planets, not, bound, to, host, stars, than, there, are, stars, the, milky, way, contains, an, average, of, at, least, one, planet, per, star, resulting, in, 100, 400, billion, planets, according, to, a, january, 2013, study, of, the, five, planet, star, system, kepler, 32, by, the, kepler, space, observatory, a, different, january, 2013, analysis, of, kepler, data, estimated, that, at, least, 17, billion, earth, sized, exoplanets, reside, in, the, milky, way, in, november, 2013, astronomers, reported, based, on, kepler, space, mission, data, that, there, could, be, as, many, as, 40, billion, earth, sized, planets, orbiting, in, the, habitable, zones, of, sun, like, stars, and, red, dwarfs, within, the, milky, way, 11, billion, of, these, estimated, planets, may, be, orbiting, sun, like, stars, the, nearest, exoplanet, may, be, 4, 2, light, years, away, orbiting, the, red, dwarf, proxima, centauri, according, to, a, 2016, study, such, earth, sized, planets, may, be, more, numerous, than, gas, giants, though, harder, to, detect, at, great, distances, given, their, small, size, besides, exoplanets, exocomets, comets, beyond, the, solar, system, have, also, been, detected, and, may, be, common, in, the, milky, way, more, recently, in, november, 2020, over, 300, million, habitable, exoplanets, are, estimated, to, exist, in, the, milky, way, galaxy, when, compared, to, other, more, distant, galaxies, in, the, universe, the, milky, way, galaxy, has, a, below, average, amount, of, neutrino, luminosity, making, our, galaxy, a, neutrino, desert, the, milky, way, consists, of, a, bar, shaped, core, region, surrounded, by, a, warped, disk, of, gas, dust, and, stars, the, mass, distribution, within, the, milky, way, closely, resembles, the, type, sbc, in, the, hubble, classification, which, represents, spiral, galaxies, with, relatively, loosely, wound, arms, astronomers, first, began, to, conjecture, that, the, milky, way, is, a, barred, spiral, galaxy, rather, than, an, ordinary, spiral, galaxy, in, the, 1960s, these, conjectures, were, confirmed, by, the, spitzer, space, telescope, observations, in, 2005, that, showed, the, milky, way, s, central, bar, to, be, larger, than, previously, thought, the, sun, is, 25, 000, 28, 000, ly, 7, 7, 8, 6, kpc, from, the, galactic, center, this, value, is, estimated, using, geometric, based, methods, or, by, measuring, selected, astronomical, objects, that, serve, as, standard, candles, with, different, techniques, yielding, various, values, within, this, approximate, range, in, the, inner, few, kiloparsecs, around, 10, 000, light, years, radius, is, a, dense, concentration, of, mostly, old, stars, in, a, roughly, spheroidal, shape, called, the, bulge, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, milky, way, lacks, a, bulge, due, to, a, collision, and, merger, between, previous, galaxies, and, that, instead, it, only, has, a, pseudobulge, formed, by, its, central, bar, however, confusion, in, the, literature, between, the, peanut, shell, shaped, structure, created, by, instabilities, in, the, bar, versus, a, possible, bulge, with, an, expected, half, light, radius, of, 0, 5, kpc, abounds, the, galactic, center, is, marked, by, an, intense, radio, source, named, sagittarius, a, pronounced, sagittarius, a, star, the, motion, of, material, around, the, center, indicates, that, sagittarius, a, harbors, a, massive, compact, object, this, concentration, of, mass, is, best, explained, as, a, supermassive, black, hole, smbh, with, an, estimated, mass, of, 4, 1, 4, 5, million, times, the, mass, of, the, sun, the, rate, of, accretion, of, the, smbh, is, consistent, with, an, inactive, galactic, nucleus, being, estimated, at, 1, 10, 5, m, per, year, observations, indicate, that, there, are, smbhs, located, near, the, center, of, most, normal, galaxies, the, nature, of, the, milky, way, s, bar, is, actively, debated, with, estimates, for, its, half, length, and, orientation, spanning, from, 1, to, 5, kpc, 3, 000, 16, 000, ly, and, 10, 50, degrees, relative, to, the, line, of, sight, from, earth, to, the, galactic, center, certain, authors, advocate, that, the, milky, way, features, two, distinct, bars, one, nestled, within, the, other, however, rr, lyrae, type, stars, do, not, trace, a, prominent, galactic, bar, the, bar, may, be, surrounded, by, a, ring, called, the, 5, kpc, ring, that, contains, a, large, fraction, of, the, molecular, hydrogen, present, in, the, milky, way, as, well, as, most, of, the, milky, way, s, star, formation, activity, viewed, from, the, andromeda, galaxy, it, would, be, the, brightest, feature, of, the, milky, way, x, ray, emission, from, the, core, is, aligned, with, the, massive, stars, surrounding, the, central, bar, and, the, galactic, ridge, in, june, 2023, astronomers, reported, using, a, new, cascade, neutrino, technique, to, detect, for, the, first, time, the, release, of, neutrinos, from, the, galactic, plane, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, creating, the, first, neutrino, view, of, the, milky, way, since, 1970, various, gamma, ray, detection, missions, have, discovered, 511, kev, gamma, rays, coming, from, the, general, direction, of, the, galactic, center, these, gamma, rays, are, produced, by, positrons, antielectrons, annihilating, with, electrons, in, 2008, it, was, found, that, the, distribution, of, the, sources, of, the, gamma, rays, resembles, the, distribution, of, low, mass, x, ray, binaries, seeming, to, indicate, that, these, x, ray, binaries, are, sending, positrons, and, electrons, into, interstellar, space, where, they, slow, down, and, annihilate, the, observations, were, both, made, by, nasa, and, esa, s, satellites, in, 1970, gamma, ray, detectors, found, that, the, emitting, region, was, about, 10, 000, light, years, across, with, a, luminosity, of, about, 10, 000, suns, in, 2010, two, gigantic, spherical, bubbles, of, high, energy, gamma, emission, were, detected, to, the, north, and, the, south, of, the, milky, way, core, using, data, from, the, fermi, gamma, ray, space, telescope, the, diameter, of, each, of, the, bubbles, is, about, 25, 000, light, years, 7, 7, kpc, or, about, 1, 4, of, the, galaxy, s, estimated, diameter, they, stretch, up, to, grus, and, to, virgo, on, the, night, sky, of, the, southern, hemisphere, subsequently, observations, with, the, parkes, telescope, at, radio, frequencies, identified, polarized, emission, that, is, associated, with, the, fermi, bubbles, these, observations, are, best, interpreted, as, a, magnetized, outflow, driven, by, star, formation, in, the, central, 640, ly, 200, pc, of, the, milky, way, later, on, january, 5, 2015, nasa, reported, observing, an, x, ray, flare, 400, times, brighter, than, usual, a, record, breaker, from, sagittarius, a, the, unusual, event, may, have, been, caused, by, the, breaking, apart, of, an, asteroid, falling, into, the, black, hole, or, by, the, entanglement, of, magnetic, field, lines, within, gas, flowing, into, sagittarius, a, outside, the, gravitational, influence, of, the, galactic, bar, the, structure, of, the, interstellar, medium, and, stars, in, the, disk, of, the, milky, way, is, organized, into, four, spiral, arms, spiral, arms, typically, contain, a, higher, density, of, interstellar, gas, and, dust, than, the, galactic, average, as, well, as, a, greater, concentration, of, star, formation, as, traced, by, h, ii, regions, and, molecular, clouds, the, milky, way, s, spiral, structure, is, uncertain, and, there, is, currently, no, consensus, on, the, nature, of, the, milky, way, s, arms, perfect, logarithmic, spiral, patterns, only, crudely, describe, features, near, the, sun, because, galaxies, commonly, have, arms, that, branch, merge, twist, unexpectedly, and, feature, a, degree, of, irregularity, the, possible, scenario, of, the, sun, within, a, spur, local, arm, emphasizes, that, point, and, indicates, that, such, features, are, probably, not, unique, and, exist, elsewhere, in, the, milky, way, estimates, of, the, pitch, angle, of, the, arms, range, from, about, 7, to, 25, there, are, thought, to, be, four, spiral, arms, that, all, start, near, the, milky, way, galaxy, s, center, these, are, named, as, follows, with, the, positions, of, the, arms, shown, in, the, image, two, spiral, arms, the, scutum, centaurus, arm, and, the, carina, sagittarius, arm, have, tangent, points, inside, the, sun, s, orbit, about, the, center, of, the, milky, way, if, these, arms, contain, an, overdensity, of, stars, compared, to, the, average, density, of, stars, in, the, galactic, disk, it, would, be, detectable, by, counting, the, stars, near, the, tangent, point, two, surveys, of, near, infrared, light, which, is, sensitive, primarily, to, red, giants, and, not, affected, by, dust, extinction, detected, the, predicted, overabundance, in, the, scutum, centaurus, arm, but, not, in, the, carina, sagittarius, arm, the, scutum, centaurus, arm, contains, approximately, 30, more, red, giants, than, would, be, expected, in, the, absence, of, a, spiral, arm, this, observation, suggests, that, the, milky, way, possesses, only, two, major, stellar, arms, the, perseus, arm, and, the, scutum, centaurus, arm, the, rest, of, the, arms, contain, excess, gas, but, not, excess, old, stars, in, december, 2013, astronomers, found, that, the, distribution, of, young, stars, and, star, forming, regions, matches, the, four, arm, spiral, description, of, the, milky, way, thus, the, milky, way, appears, to, have, two, spiral, arms, as, traced, by, old, stars, and, four, spiral, arms, as, traced, by, gas, and, young, stars, the, explanation, for, this, apparent, discrepancy, is, unclear, the, near, 3, kpc, arm, also, called, the, expanding, 3, kpc, arm, or, simply, the, 3, kpc, arm, was, discovered, in, the, 1950s, by, astronomer, van, woerden, and, collaborators, through, 21, centimeter, radio, measurements, of, h, i, atomic, hydrogen, it, was, found, to, be, expanding, away, from, the, central, bulge, at, more, than, 50, km, s, it, is, located, in, the, fourth, galactic, quadrant, at, a, distance, of, about, 5, 2, kpc, from, the, sun, and, 3, 3, kpc, from, the, galactic, center, the, far, 3, kpc, arm, was, discovered, in, 2008, by, astronomer, tom, dame, center, for, astrophysics, harvard, smithsonian, it, is, located, in, the, first, galactic, quadrant, at, a, distance, of, 3, kpc, about, 10, 000, ly, from, the, galactic, center, a, simulation, published, in, 2011, suggested, that, the, milky, way, may, have, obtained, its, spiral, arm, structure, as, a, result, of, repeated, collisions, with, the, sagittarius, dwarf, elliptical, galaxy, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, milky, way, contains, two, different, spiral, patterns, an, inner, one, formed, by, the, sagittarius, arm, that, rotates, fast, and, an, outer, one, formed, by, the, carina, and, perseus, arms, whose, rotation, velocity, is, slower, and, whose, arms, are, tightly, wound, in, this, scenario, suggested, by, numerical, simulations, of, the, dynamics, of, the, different, spiral, arms, the, outer, pattern, would, form, an, outer, pseudoring, and, the, two, patterns, would, be, connected, by, the, cygnus, arm, outside, of, the, major, spiral, arms, is, the, monoceros, ring, or, outer, ring, a, ring, of, gas, and, stars, torn, from, other, galaxies, billions, of, years, ago, however, several, members, of, the, scientific, community, recently, restated, their, position, affirming, the, monoceros, structure, is, nothing, more, than, an, over, density, produced, by, the, flared, and, warped, thick, disk, of, the, milky, way, the, structure, of, the, milky, way, s, disk, is, warped, along, an, s, curve, the, galactic, disk, is, surrounded, by, a, spheroidal, halo, of, old, stars, and, globular, clusters, of, which, 90, lie, within, 100, 000, light, years, 30, kpc, of, the, galactic, center, however, a, few, globular, clusters, have, been, found, farther, such, as, pal, 4, and, am, 1, at, more, than, 200, 000, light, years, from, the, galactic, center, about, 40, of, the, milky, way, s, clusters, are, on, retrograde, orbits, which, means, they, move, in, the, opposite, direction, from, the, milky, way, rotation, the, globular, clusters, can, follow, rosette, orbits, about, the, milky, way, in, contrast, to, the, elliptical, orbit, of, a, planet, around, a, star, although, the, disk, contains, dust, that, obscures, the, view, in, some, wavelengths, the, halo, component, does, not, active, star, formation, takes, place, in, the, disk, especially, in, the, spiral, arms, which, represent, areas, of, high, density, but, does, not, take, place, in, the, halo, as, there, is, little, cool, gas, to, collapse, into, stars, open, clusters, are, also, located, primarily, in, the, disk, discoveries, in, the, early, 21st, century, have, added, dimension, to, the, knowledge, of, the, milky, way, s, structure, with, the, discovery, that, the, disk, of, the, andromeda, galaxy, m31, extends, much, farther, than, previously, thought, the, possibility, of, the, disk, of, the, milky, way, extending, farther, is, apparent, and, this, is, supported, by, evidence, from, the, discovery, of, the, outer, arm, extension, of, the, cygnus, arm, and, of, a, similar, extension, of, the, scutum, centaurus, arm, with, the, discovery, of, the, sagittarius, dwarf, elliptical, galaxy, came, the, discovery, of, a, ribbon, of, galactic, debris, as, the, polar, orbit, of, the, dwarf, and, its, interaction, with, the, milky, way, tears, it, apart, similarly, with, the, discovery, of, the, canis, major, dwarf, galaxy, it, was, found, that, a, ring, of, galactic, debris, from, its, interaction, with, the, milky, way, encircles, the, galactic, disk, the, sloan, digital, sky, survey, of, the, northern, sky, shows, a, huge, and, diffuse, structure, spread, out, across, an, area, around, 5, 000, times, the, size, of, a, full, moon, within, the, milky, way, that, does, not, seem, to, fit, within, current, models, the, collection, of, stars, rises, close, to, perpendicular, to, the, plane, of, the, spiral, arms, of, the, milky, way, the, proposed, likely, interpretation, is, that, a, dwarf, galaxy, is, merging, with, the, milky, way, this, galaxy, is, tentatively, named, the, virgo, stellar, stream, and, is, found, in, the, direction, of, virgo, about, 30, 000, light, years, 9, kpc, away, in, addition, to, the, stellar, halo, the, chandra, x, ray, observatory, xmm, newton, and, suzaku, have, provided, evidence, that, there, is, also, a, gaseous, halo, containing, a, large, amount, of, hot, gas, this, halo, extends, for, hundreds, of, thousands, of, light, years, much, farther, than, the, stellar, halo, and, close, to, the, distance, of, the, large, and, small, magellanic, clouds, the, mass, of, this, hot, halo, is, nearly, equivalent, to, the, mass, of, the, milky, way, itself, the, temperature, of, this, halo, gas, is, between, 1, and, 2, 5, million, k, 1, 8, and, 4, 5, million, f, observations, of, distant, galaxies, indicate, that, the, universe, had, about, one, sixth, as, much, baryonic, ordinary, matter, as, dark, matter, when, it, was, just, a, few, billion, years, old, however, only, about, half, of, those, baryons, are, accounted, for, in, the, modern, universe, based, on, observations, of, nearby, galaxies, like, the, milky, way, if, the, finding, that, the, mass, of, the, halo, is, comparable, to, the, mass, of, the, milky, way, is, confirmed, it, could, be, the, identity, of, the, missing, baryons, around, the, milky, way, the, stars, and, gas, in, the, milky, way, rotate, about, its, center, differentially, meaning, that, the, rotation, period, varies, with, location, as, is, typical, for, spiral, galaxies, the, orbital, speed, of, most, stars, in, the, milky, way, does, not, depend, strongly, on, their, distance, from, the, center, away, from, the, central, bulge, or, outer, rim, the, typical, stellar, orbital, speed, is, between, 210, 10, km, s, 470, 000, 22, 000, mph, hence, the, orbital, period, of, the, typical, star, is, directly, proportional, only, to, the, length, of, the, path, traveled, this, is, unlike, the, situation, within, the, solar, system, where, two, body, gravitational, dynamics, dominate, and, different, orbits, have, significantly, different, velocities, associated, with, them, the, rotation, curve, shown, in, the, figure, describes, this, rotation, toward, the, center, of, the, milky, way, the, orbit, speeds, are, too, low, whereas, beyond, 7, kpcs, the, speeds, are, too, high, to, match, what, would, be, expected, from, the, universal, law, of, gravitation, if, the, milky, way, contained, only, the, mass, observed, in, stars, gas, and, other, baryonic, ordinary, matter, the, rotational, speed, would, decrease, with, distance, from, the, center, however, the, observed, curve, is, relatively, flat, indicating, that, there, is, additional, mass, that, cannot, be, detected, directly, with, electromagnetic, radiation, this, inconsistency, is, attributed, to, dark, matter, the, rotation, curve, of, the, milky, way, agrees, with, the, universal, rotation, curve, of, spiral, galaxies, the, best, evidence, for, the, existence, of, dark, matter, in, galaxies, alternatively, a, minority, of, astronomers, propose, that, a, modification, of, the, law, of, gravity, may, explain, the, observed, rotation, curve, the, milky, way, began, as, one, or, several, small, overdensities, in, the, mass, distribution, in, the, universe, shortly, after, the, big, bang, 13, 61, billion, years, ago, some, of, these, overdensities, were, the, seeds, of, globular, clusters, in, which, the, oldest, remaining, stars, in, what, is, now, the, milky, way, formed, nearly, half, the, matter, in, the, milky, way, may, have, come, from, other, distant, galaxies, these, stars, and, clusters, now, comprise, the, stellar, halo, of, the, milky, way, within, a, few, billion, years, of, the, birth, of, the, first, stars, the, mass, of, the, milky, way, was, large, enough, so, that, it, was, spinning, relatively, quickly, due, to, conservation, of, angular, momentum, this, led, the, gaseous, interstellar, medium, to, collapse, from, a, roughly, spheroidal, shape, to, a, disk, therefore, later, generations, of, stars, formed, in, this, spiral, disk, most, younger, stars, including, the, sun, are, observed, to, be, in, the, disk, since, the, first, stars, began, to, form, the, milky, way, has, grown, through, both, galaxy, mergers, particularly, early, in, the, milky, way, s, growth, and, accretion, of, gas, directly, from, the, galactic, halo, the, milky, way, is, currently, accreting, material, from, several, small, galaxies, including, two, of, its, largest, satellite, galaxies, the, large, and, small, magellanic, clouds, through, the, magellanic, stream, direct, accretion, of, gas, is, observed, in, high, velocity, clouds, like, the, smith, cloud, cosmological, simulations, indicate, that, 11, billion, years, ago, it, merged, with, a, particularly, large, galaxy, that, has, been, labeled, the, kraken, properties, of, the, milky, way, such, as, stellar, mass, angular, momentum, and, metallicity, in, its, outermost, regions, suggest, it, has, undergone, no, mergers, with, large, galaxies, in, the, last, 10, billion, years, this, lack, of, recent, major, mergers, is, unusual, among, similar, spiral, galaxies, its, neighbour, the, andromeda, galaxy, appears, to, have, a, more, typical, history, shaped, by, more, recent, mergers, with, relatively, large, galaxies, according, to, recent, studies, the, milky, way, as, well, as, the, andromeda, galaxy, lie, in, what, in, the, galaxy, color, magnitude, diagram, is, known, as, the, green, valley, a, region, populated, by, galaxies, in, transition, from, the, blue, cloud, galaxies, actively, forming, new, stars, to, the, red, sequence, galaxies, that, lack, star, formation, star, formation, activity, in, green, valley, galaxies, is, slowing, as, they, run, out, of, star, forming, gas, in, the, interstellar, medium, in, simulated, galaxies, with, similar, properties, star, formation, will, typically, have, been, extinguished, within, about, five, billion, years, from, now, even, accounting, for, the, expected, short, term, increase, in, the, rate, of, star, formation, due, to, the, collision, between, both, the, milky, way, and, the, andromeda, galaxy, measurements, of, other, galaxies, similar, to, the, milky, way, suggest, it, is, among, the, reddest, and, brightest, spiral, galaxies, that, are, still, forming, new, stars, and, it, is, just, slightly, bluer, than, the, bluest, red, sequence, galaxies, globular, clusters, are, among, the, oldest, objects, in, the, milky, way, which, thus, set, a, lower, limit, on, the, age, of, the, milky, way, the, ages, of, individual, stars, in, the, milky, way, can, be, estimated, by, measuring, the, abundance, of, long, lived, radioactive, elements, such, as, thorium, 232, and, uranium, 238, then, comparing, the, results, to, estimates, of, their, original, abundance, a, technique, called, nucleocosmochronology, these, yield, values, of, about, 12, 5, 3, billion, years, for, cs, 31082, 001, and, 13, 8, 4, billion, years, for, bd, 17, 3248, once, a, white, dwarf, is, formed, it, begins, to, undergo, radiative, cooling, and, the, surface, temperature, steadily, drops, by, measuring, the, temperatures, of, the, coolest, of, these, white, dwarfs, and, comparing, them, to, their, expected, initial, temperature, an, age, estimate, can, be, made, with, this, technique, the, age, of, the, globular, cluster, m4, was, estimated, as, 12, 7, 0, 7, billion, years, age, estimates, of, the, oldest, of, these, clusters, gives, a, best, fit, estimate, of, 12, 6, billion, years, and, a, 95, confidence, upper, limit, of, 16, billion, years, in, november, 2018, astronomers, reported, the, discovery, of, one, of, the, oldest, stars, in, the, universe, about, 13, 5, billion, years, old, 2mass, j18082002, 5104378, b, is, a, tiny, ultra, metal, poor, ump, star, made, almost, entirely, of, materials, released, from, the, big, bang, and, is, possibly, one, of, the, first, stars, the, discovery, of, the, star, in, the, milky, way, galaxy, suggests, that, the, galaxy, may, be, at, least, 3, billion, years, older, than, previously, thought, several, individual, stars, have, been, found, in, the, milky, way, s, halo, with, measured, ages, very, close, to, the, 13, 80, billion, year, age, of, the, universe, in, 2007, a, star, in, the, galactic, halo, he, 1523, 0901, was, estimated, to, be, about, 13, 2, billion, years, old, as, the, oldest, known, object, in, the, milky, way, at, that, time, this, measurement, placed, a, lower, limit, on, the, age, of, the, milky, way, this, estimate, was, made, using, the, uv, visual, echelle, spectrograph, of, the, very, large, telescope, to, measure, the, relative, strengths, of, spectral, lines, caused, by, the, presence, of, thorium, and, other, elements, created, by, the, r, process, the, line, strengths, yield, abundances, of, different, elemental, isotopes, from, which, an, estimate, of, the, age, of, the, star, can, be, derived, using, nucleocosmochronology, another, star, hd, 140283, is, 14, 5, 0, 7, billion, years, old, according, to, observations, utilizing, adaptive, optics, to, correct, for, earth, s, atmospheric, distortion, stars, in, the, galaxy, s, bulge, date, to, about, 12, 8, billion, years, old, the, age, of, stars, in, the, galactic, thin, disk, has, also, been, estimated, using, nucleocosmochronology, measurements, of, thin, disk, stars, yield, an, estimate, that, the, thin, disk, formed, 8, 8, 1, 7, billion, years, ago, these, measurements, suggest, there, was, a, hiatus, of, almost, 5, billion, years, between, the, formation, of, the, galactic, halo, and, the, thin, disk, recent, analysis, of, the, chemical, signatures, of, thousands, of, stars, suggests, that, stellar, formation, might, have, dropped, by, an, order, of, magnitude, at, the, time, of, disk, formation, 10, to, 8, billion, years, ago, when, interstellar, gas, was, too, hot, to, form, new, stars, at, the, same, rate, as, before, the, satellite, galaxies, surrounding, the, milky, way, are, not, randomly, distributed, but, seem, to, be, the, result, of, a, breakup, of, some, larger, system, producing, a, ring, structure, 500, 000, light, years, in, diameter, and, 50, 000, light, years, wide, close, encounters, between, galaxies, like, that, expected, in, 4, billion, years, with, the, andromeda, galaxy, can, rip, off, huge, tails, of, gas, which, over, time, can, coalesce, to, form, dwarf, galaxies, in, a, ring, at, an, arbitrary, angle, to, the, main, disc, the, milky, way, and, the, andromeda, galaxy, are, a, binary, system, of, giant, spiral, galaxies, belonging, to, a, group, of, 50, closely, bound, galaxies, known, as, the, local, group, surrounded, by, a, local, void, itself, being, part, of, the, local, sheet, and, in, turn, the, virgo, supercluster, surrounding, the, virgo, supercluster, are, a, number, of, voids, devoid, of, many, galaxies, the, microscopium, void, to, the, north, the, sculptor, void, to, the, left, the, bo, tes, void, to, the, right, and, the, canes, major, void, to, the, south, these, voids, change, shape, over, time, creating, filamentous, structures, of, galaxies, the, virgo, supercluster, for, instance, is, being, drawn, towards, the, great, attractor, which, in, turn, forms, part, of, a, greater, structure, called, laniakea, two, smaller, galaxies, and, a, number, of, dwarf, galaxies, in, the, local, group, orbit, the, milky, way, the, largest, of, these, is, the, large, magellanic, cloud, with, a, diameter, of, 32, 200, light, years, it, has, a, close, companion, the, small, magellanic, cloud, the, magellanic, stream, is, a, stream, of, neutral, hydrogen, gas, extending, from, these, two, small, galaxies, across, 100, of, the, sky, the, stream, is, thought, to, have, been, dragged, from, the, magellanic, clouds, in, tidal, interactions, with, the, milky, way, some, of, the, dwarf, galaxies, orbiting, the, milky, way, are, canis, major, dwarf, the, closest, sagittarius, dwarf, elliptical, galaxy, ursa, minor, dwarf, sculptor, dwarf, sextans, dwarf, fornax, dwarf, and, leo, i, dwarf, the, smallest, dwarf, galaxies, of, the, milky, way, are, only, 500, light, years, in, diameter, these, include, carina, dwarf, draco, dwarf, and, leo, ii, dwarf, there, may, still, be, undetected, dwarf, galaxies, that, are, dynamically, bound, to, the, milky, way, which, is, supported, by, the, detection, of, nine, new, satellites, of, the, milky, way, in, a, relatively, small, patch, of, the, night, sky, in, 2015, there, are, some, dwarf, galaxies, that, have, already, been, absorbed, by, the, milky, way, such, as, the, progenitor, of, omega, centauri, in, 2005, with, further, confirmation, in, 2012, researchers, reported, that, most, satellite, galaxies, of, the, milky, way, lie, in, a, very, large, disk, and, orbit, in, the, same, direction, this, came, as, a, surprise, according, to, standard, cosmology, the, satellite, galaxies, should, form, in, dark, matter, halos, and, they, should, be, widely, distributed, and, moving, in, random, directions, this, discrepancy, is, still, not, explained, in, january, 2006, researchers, reported, that, the, heretofore, unexplained, warp, in, the, disk, of, the, milky, way, has, now, been, mapped, and, found, to, be, a, ripple, or, vibration, set, up, by, the, large, and, small, magellanic, clouds, as, they, orbit, the, milky, way, causing, vibrations, when, they, pass, through, its, edges, previously, these, two, galaxies, at, around, 2, of, the, mass, of, the, milky, way, were, considered, too, small, to, influence, the, milky, way, however, in, a, computer, model, the, movement, of, these, two, galaxies, creates, a, dark, matter, wake, that, amplifies, their, influence, on, the, larger, milky, way, current, measurements, suggest, the, andromeda, galaxy, is, approaching, the, milky, way, at, 100, to, 140, km, s, 220, 000, to, 310, 000, mph, in, 4, 3, billion, years, there, may, be, an, andromeda, milky, way, collision, depending, on, the, importance, of, unknown, lateral, components, to, the, galaxies, relative, motion, if, they, collide, the, chance, of, individual, stars, colliding, with, each, other, is, extremely, low, but, instead, the, two, galaxies, will, merge, to, form, a, single, elliptical, galaxy, or, perhaps, a, large, disk, galaxy, over, the, course, of, about, six, billion, years, although, special, relativity, states, that, there, is, no, preferred, inertial, frame, of, reference, in, space, with, which, to, compare, the, milky, way, the, milky, way, does, have, a, velocity, with, respect, to, cosmological, frames, of, reference, one, such, frame, of, reference, is, the, hubble, flow, the, apparent, motions, of, galaxy, clusters, due, to, the, expansion, of, space, individual, galaxies, including, the, milky, way, have, peculiar, velocities, relative, to, the, average, flow, thus, to, compare, the, milky, way, to, the, hubble, flow, one, must, consider, a, volume, large, enough, so, that, the, expansion, of, the, universe, dominates, over, local, random, motions, a, large, enough, volume, means, that, the, mean, motion, of, galaxies, within, this, volume, is, equal, to, the, hubble, flow, astronomers, believe, the, milky, way, is, moving, at, approximately, 630, km, s, 1, 400, 000, mph, with, respect, to, this, local, co, moving, frame, of, reference, the, milky, way, is, moving, in, the, general, direction, of, the, great, attractor, and, other, galaxy, clusters, including, the, shapley, supercluster, behind, it, the, local, group, a, cluster, of, gravitationally, bound, galaxies, containing, among, others, the, milky, way, and, the, andromeda, galaxy, is, part, of, a, supercluster, called, the, local, supercluster, centered, near, the, virgo, cluster, although, they, are, moving, away, from, each, other, at, 967, km, s, 2, 160, 000, mph, as, part, of, the, hubble, flow, this, velocity, is, less, than, would, be, expected, given, the, 16, 8, million, pc, distance, due, to, the, gravitational, attraction, between, the, local, group, and, the, virgo, cluster, another, reference, frame, is, provided, by, the, cosmic, microwave, background, cmb, in, which, the, cmb, temperature, is, least, distorted, by, doppler, shift, zero, dipole, moment, the, milky, way, is, moving, at, 552, 6, km, s, 1, 235, 000, 13, 000, mph, with, respect, to, this, frame, toward, 10, 5, right, ascension, 24, declination, j2000, epoch, near, the, center, of, hydra, this, motion, is, observed, by, satellites, such, as, the, cosmic, background, explorer, cobe, and, the, wilkinson, microwave, anisotropy, probe, wmap, as, a, dipole, contribution, to, the, cmb, as, photons, in, equilibrium, in, the, cmb, frame, get, blue, shifted, in, the, direction, of, the, motion, and, red, shifted, in, the, opposite, direction
