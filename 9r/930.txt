alternating, current, ac, is, an, electric, current, that, periodically, reverses, direction, and, changes, its, magnitude, continuously, with, time, in, contrast, to, direct, current, dc, which, flows, only, in, one, direction, alternating, current, is, the, form, in, which, electric, power, is, delivered, to, businesses, and, residences, and, it, is, the, form, of, electrical, energy, that, consumers, typically, use, when, they, plug, kitchen, appliances, televisions, fans, and, electric, lamps, into, a, wall, socket, the, abbreviations, ac, and, dc, are, often, used, to, mean, simply, alternating, and, direct, respectively, as, when, they, modify, current, or, voltage, the, usual, waveform, of, alternating, current, in, most, electric, power, circuits, is, a, sine, wave, whose, positive, half, period, corresponds, with, positive, direction, of, the, current, and, vice, versa, the, full, period, is, called, a, cycle, in, certain, applications, like, guitar, amplifiers, different, waveforms, are, used, such, as, triangular, waves, or, square, waves, audio, and, radio, signals, carried, on, electrical, wires, are, also, examples, of, alternating, current, these, types, of, alternating, current, carry, information, such, as, sound, audio, or, images, video, sometimes, carried, by, modulation, of, an, ac, carrier, signal, these, currents, typically, alternate, at, higher, frequencies, than, those, used, in, power, transmission, electrical, energy, is, distributed, as, alternating, current, because, ac, voltage, may, be, increased, or, decreased, with, a, transformer, this, allows, the, power, to, be, transmitted, through, power, lines, efficiently, at, high, voltage, which, reduces, the, energy, lost, as, heat, due, to, resistance, of, the, wire, and, transformed, to, a, lower, safer, voltage, for, use, use, of, a, higher, voltage, leads, to, significantly, more, efficient, transmission, of, power, the, power, losses, p, w, displaystyle, p, rm, w, in, the, wire, are, a, product, of, the, square, of, the, current, i, and, the, resistance, r, of, the, wire, described, by, the, formula, this, means, that, when, transmitting, a, fixed, power, on, a, given, wire, if, the, current, is, halved, i, e, the, voltage, is, doubled, the, power, loss, due, to, the, wire, s, resistance, will, be, reduced, to, one, quarter, the, power, transmitted, is, equal, to, the, product, of, the, current, and, the, voltage, assuming, no, phase, difference, that, is, consequently, power, transmitted, at, a, higher, voltage, requires, less, loss, producing, current, than, for, the, same, power, at, a, lower, voltage, power, is, often, transmitted, at, hundreds, of, kilovolts, on, pylons, and, transformed, down, to, tens, of, kilovolts, to, be, transmitted, on, lower, level, lines, and, finally, transformed, down, to, 100, v, 240, v, for, domestic, use, high, voltages, have, disadvantages, such, as, the, increased, insulation, required, and, generally, increased, difficulty, in, their, safe, handling, in, a, power, plant, energy, is, generated, at, a, convenient, voltage, for, the, design, of, a, generator, and, then, stepped, up, to, a, high, voltage, for, transmission, near, the, loads, the, transmission, voltage, is, stepped, down, to, the, voltages, used, by, equipment, consumer, voltages, vary, somewhat, depending, on, the, country, and, size, of, load, but, generally, motors, and, lighting, are, built, to, use, up, to, a, few, hundred, volts, between, phases, the, voltage, delivered, to, equipment, such, as, lighting, and, motor, loads, is, standardized, with, an, allowable, range, of, voltage, over, which, equipment, is, expected, to, operate, standard, power, utilization, voltages, and, percentage, tolerance, vary, in, the, different, mains, power, systems, found, in, the, world, high, voltage, direct, current, hvdc, electric, power, transmission, systems, have, become, more, viable, as, technology, has, provided, efficient, means, of, changing, the, voltage, of, dc, power, transmission, with, high, voltage, direct, current, was, not, feasible, in, the, early, days, of, electric, power, transmission, as, there, was, then, no, economically, viable, way, to, step, the, voltage, of, dc, down, for, end, user, applications, such, as, lighting, incandescent, bulbs, three, phase, electrical, generation, is, very, common, the, simplest, way, is, to, use, three, separate, coils, in, the, generator, stator, physically, offset, by, an, angle, of, 120, one, third, of, a, complete, 360, phase, to, each, other, three, current, waveforms, are, produced, that, are, equal, in, magnitude, and, 120, out, of, phase, to, each, other, if, coils, are, added, opposite, to, these, 60, spacing, they, generate, the, same, phases, with, reverse, polarity, and, so, can, be, simply, wired, together, in, practice, higher, pole, orders, are, commonly, used, for, example, a, 12, pole, machine, would, have, 36, coils, 10, spacing, the, advantage, is, that, lower, rotational, speeds, can, be, used, to, generate, the, same, frequency, for, example, a, 2, pole, machine, running, at, 3600, rpm, and, a, 12, pole, machine, running, at, 600, rpm, produce, the, same, frequency, the, lower, speed, is, preferable, for, larger, machines, if, the, load, on, a, three, phase, system, is, balanced, equally, among, the, phases, no, current, flows, through, the, neutral, point, even, in, the, worst, case, unbalanced, linear, load, the, neutral, current, will, not, exceed, the, highest, of, the, phase, currents, non, linear, loads, e, g, the, switch, mode, power, supplies, widely, used, may, require, an, oversized, neutral, bus, and, neutral, conductor, in, the, upstream, distribution, panel, to, handle, harmonics, harmonics, can, cause, neutral, conductor, current, levels, to, exceed, that, of, one, or, all, phase, conductors, for, three, phase, at, utilization, voltages, a, four, wire, system, is, often, used, when, stepping, down, three, phase, a, transformer, with, a, delta, 3, wire, primary, and, a, star, 4, wire, center, earthed, secondary, is, often, used, so, there, is, no, need, for, a, neutral, on, the, supply, side, for, smaller, customers, just, how, small, varies, by, country, and, age, of, the, installation, only, a, single, phase, and, neutral, or, two, phases, and, neutral, are, taken, to, the, property, for, larger, installations, all, three, phases, and, neutral, are, taken, to, the, main, distribution, panel, from, the, three, phase, main, panel, both, single, and, three, phase, circuits, may, lead, off, three, wire, single, phase, systems, with, a, single, center, tapped, transformer, giving, two, live, conductors, is, a, common, distribution, scheme, for, residential, and, small, commercial, buildings, in, north, america, this, arrangement, is, sometimes, incorrectly, referred, to, as, two, phase, a, similar, method, is, used, for, a, different, reason, on, construction, sites, in, the, uk, small, power, tools, and, lighting, are, supposed, to, be, supplied, by, a, local, center, tapped, transformer, with, a, voltage, of, 55, v, between, each, power, conductor, and, earth, this, significantly, reduces, the, risk, of, electric, shock, in, the, event, that, one, of, the, live, conductors, becomes, exposed, through, an, equipment, fault, whilst, still, allowing, a, reasonable, voltage, of, 110, v, between, the, two, conductors, for, running, the, tools, a, third, wire, called, the, bond, or, earth, wire, is, often, connected, between, non, current, carrying, metal, enclosures, and, earth, ground, this, conductor, provides, protection, from, electric, shock, due, to, accidental, contact, of, circuit, conductors, with, the, metal, chassis, of, portable, appliances, and, tools, bonding, all, non, current, carrying, metal, parts, into, one, complete, system, ensures, there, is, always, a, low, electrical, impedance, path, to, ground, sufficient, to, carry, any, fault, current, for, as, long, as, it, takes, for, the, system, to, clear, the, fault, this, low, impedance, path, allows, the, maximum, amount, of, fault, current, causing, the, overcurrent, protection, device, breakers, fuses, to, trip, or, burn, out, as, quickly, as, possible, bringing, the, electrical, system, to, a, safe, state, all, bond, wires, are, bonded, to, ground, at, the, main, service, panel, as, is, the, neutral, identified, conductor, if, present, the, frequency, of, the, electrical, system, varies, by, country, and, sometimes, within, a, country, most, electric, power, is, generated, at, either, 50, or, 60, hertz, some, countries, have, a, mixture, of, 50, hz, and, 60, hz, supplies, notably, electricity, power, transmission, in, japan, a, low, frequency, eases, the, design, of, electric, motors, particularly, for, hoisting, crushing, and, rolling, applications, and, commutator, type, traction, motors, for, applications, such, as, railways, however, low, frequency, also, causes, noticeable, flicker, in, arc, lamps, and, incandescent, light, bulbs, the, use, of, lower, frequencies, also, provided, the, advantage, of, lower, transmission, losses, which, are, proportional, to, frequency, the, original, niagara, falls, generators, were, built, to, produce, 25, hz, power, as, a, compromise, between, low, frequency, for, traction, and, heavy, induction, motors, while, still, allowing, incandescent, lighting, to, operate, although, with, noticeable, flicker, most, of, the, 25, hz, residential, and, commercial, customers, for, niagara, falls, power, were, converted, to, 60, hz, by, the, late, 1950s, although, some, 25, hz, industrial, customers, still, existed, as, of, the, start, of, the, 21st, century, 16, 7, hz, power, formerly, 16, 2, 3, hz, is, still, used, in, some, european, rail, systems, such, as, in, austria, germany, norway, sweden, and, switzerland, off, shore, military, textile, industry, marine, aircraft, and, spacecraft, applications, sometimes, use, 400, hz, for, benefits, of, reduced, weight, of, apparatus, or, higher, motor, speeds, computer, mainframe, systems, were, often, powered, by, 400, hz, or, 415, hz, for, benefits, of, ripple, reduction, while, using, smaller, internal, ac, to, dc, conversion, units, a, direct, current, flows, uniformly, throughout, the, cross, section, of, a, homogeneous, electrically, conducting, wire, an, alternating, current, of, any, frequency, is, forced, away, from, the, wire, s, center, toward, its, outer, surface, this, is, because, an, alternating, current, which, is, the, result, of, the, acceleration, of, electric, charge, creates, electromagnetic, waves, a, phenomenon, known, as, electromagnetic, radiation, electric, conductors, are, not, conducive, to, electromagnetic, waves, a, perfect, electric, conductor, prohibits, all, electromagnetic, waves, within, its, boundary, so, a, wire, that, is, made, of, a, non, perfect, conductor, a, conductor, with, finite, rather, than, infinite, electrical, conductivity, pushes, the, alternating, current, along, with, their, associated, electromagnetic, fields, away, from, the, wire, s, center, the, phenomenon, of, alternating, current, being, pushed, away, from, the, center, of, the, conductor, is, called, skin, effect, and, a, direct, current, does, not, exhibit, this, effect, since, a, direct, current, does, not, create, electromagnetic, waves, at, very, high, frequencies, the, current, no, longer, flows, in, the, wire, but, effectively, flows, on, the, surface, of, the, wire, within, a, thickness, of, a, few, skin, depths, the, skin, depth, is, the, thickness, at, which, the, current, density, is, reduced, by, 63, even, at, relatively, low, frequencies, used, for, power, transmission, 50, hz, 60, hz, non, uniform, distribution, of, current, still, occurs, in, sufficiently, thick, conductors, for, example, the, skin, depth, of, a, copper, conductor, is, approximately, 8, 57, mm, at, 60, hz, so, high, current, conductors, are, usually, hollow, to, reduce, their, mass, and, cost, this, tendency, of, alternating, current, to, flow, predominantly, in, the, periphery, of, conductors, reduces, the, effective, cross, section, of, the, conductor, this, increases, the, effective, ac, resistance, of, the, conductor, since, resistance, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, cross, sectional, area, a, conductor, s, ac, resistance, is, higher, than, its, dc, resistance, causing, a, higher, energy, loss, due, to, ohmic, heating, also, called, i, 2, r, loss, for, low, to, medium, frequencies, conductors, can, be, divided, into, stranded, wires, each, insulated, from, the, others, with, the, relative, positions, of, individual, strands, specially, arranged, within, the, conductor, bundle, wire, constructed, using, this, technique, is, called, litz, wire, this, measure, helps, to, partially, mitigate, skin, effect, by, forcing, more, equal, current, throughout, the, total, cross, section, of, the, stranded, conductors, litz, wire, is, used, for, making, high, q, inductors, reducing, losses, in, flexible, conductors, carrying, very, high, currents, at, lower, frequencies, and, in, the, windings, of, devices, carrying, higher, radio, frequency, current, up, to, hundreds, of, kilohertz, such, as, switch, mode, power, supplies, and, radio, frequency, transformers, as, written, above, an, alternating, current, is, made, of, electric, charge, under, periodic, acceleration, which, causes, radiation, of, electromagnetic, waves, energy, that, is, radiated, is, lost, depending, on, the, frequency, different, techniques, are, used, to, minimize, the, loss, due, to, radiation, at, frequencies, up, to, about, 1, ghz, pairs, of, wires, are, twisted, together, in, a, cable, forming, a, twisted, pair, this, reduces, losses, from, electromagnetic, radiation, and, inductive, coupling, a, twisted, pair, must, be, used, with, a, balanced, signalling, system, so, that, the, two, wires, carry, equal, but, opposite, currents, each, wire, in, a, twisted, pair, radiates, a, signal, but, it, is, effectively, cancelled, by, radiation, from, the, other, wire, resulting, in, almost, no, radiation, loss, coaxial, cables, are, commonly, used, at, audio, frequencies, and, above, for, convenience, a, coaxial, cable, has, a, conductive, wire, inside, a, conductive, tube, separated, by, a, dielectric, layer, the, current, flowing, on, the, surface, of, the, inner, conductor, is, equal, and, opposite, to, the, current, flowing, on, the, inner, surface, of, the, outer, tube, the, electromagnetic, field, is, thus, completely, contained, within, the, tube, and, ideally, no, energy, is, lost, to, radiation, or, coupling, outside, the, tube, coaxial, cables, have, acceptably, small, losses, for, frequencies, up, to, about, 5, ghz, for, microwave, frequencies, greater, than, 5, ghz, the, losses, due, mainly, to, the, dielectric, separating, the, inner, and, outer, tubes, being, a, non, ideal, insulator, become, too, large, making, waveguides, a, more, efficient, medium, for, transmitting, energy, coaxial, cables, often, use, a, perforated, dielectric, layer, to, separate, the, inner, and, outer, conductors, in, order, to, minimize, the, power, dissipated, by, the, dielectric, waveguides, are, similar, to, coaxial, cables, as, both, consist, of, tubes, with, the, biggest, difference, being, that, waveguides, have, no, inner, conductor, waveguides, can, have, any, arbitrary, cross, section, but, rectangular, cross, sections, are, the, most, common, because, waveguides, do, not, have, an, inner, conductor, to, carry, a, return, current, waveguides, cannot, deliver, energy, by, means, of, an, electric, current, but, rather, by, means, of, a, guided, electromagnetic, field, although, surface, currents, do, flow, on, the, inner, walls, of, the, waveguides, those, surface, currents, do, not, carry, power, power, is, carried, by, the, guided, electromagnetic, fields, the, surface, currents, are, set, up, by, the, guided, electromagnetic, fields, and, have, the, effect, of, keeping, the, fields, inside, the, waveguide, and, preventing, leakage, of, the, fields, to, the, space, outside, the, waveguide, waveguides, have, dimensions, comparable, to, the, wavelength, of, the, alternating, current, to, be, transmitted, so, they, are, feasible, only, at, microwave, frequencies, in, addition, to, this, mechanical, feasibility, electrical, resistance, of, the, non, ideal, metals, forming, the, walls, of, the, waveguide, causes, dissipation, of, power, surface, currents, flowing, on, lossy, conductors, dissipate, power, at, higher, frequencies, the, power, lost, to, this, dissipation, becomes, unacceptably, large, at, frequencies, greater, than, 200, ghz, waveguide, dimensions, become, impractically, small, and, the, ohmic, losses, in, the, waveguide, walls, become, large, instead, fiber, optics, which, are, a, form, of, dielectric, waveguides, can, be, used, for, such, frequencies, the, concepts, of, voltages, and, currents, are, no, longer, used, alternating, currents, are, accompanied, or, caused, by, alternating, voltages, an, ac, voltage, v, can, be, described, mathematically, as, a, function, of, time, by, the, following, equation, where, the, peak, to, peak, value, of, an, ac, voltage, is, defined, as, the, difference, between, its, positive, peak, and, its, negative, peak, since, the, maximum, value, of, sin, x, displaystyle, sin, x, is, 1, and, the, minimum, value, is, 1, an, ac, voltage, swings, between, v, peak, displaystyle, v, text, peak, and, v, peak, displaystyle, v, text, peak, the, peak, to, peak, voltage, usually, written, as, v, pp, displaystyle, v, text, pp, or, v, p, p, displaystyle, v, text, p, p, is, therefore, v, peak, v, peak, 2, v, peak, displaystyle, v, text, peak, v, text, peak, 2v, text, peak, below, an, ac, waveform, with, no, dc, component, is, assumed, the, rms, voltage, is, the, square, root, of, the, mean, over, one, cycle, of, the, square, of, the, instantaneous, voltage, the, relationship, between, voltage, and, the, power, delivered, is, where, r, displaystyle, r, represents, a, load, resistance, rather, than, using, instantaneous, power, p, t, displaystyle, p, t, it, is, more, practical, to, use, a, time, averaged, power, where, the, averaging, is, performed, over, any, integer, number, of, cycles, therefore, ac, voltage, is, often, expressed, as, a, root, mean, square, rms, value, written, as, v, rms, displaystyle, v, text, rms, because, for, this, reason, ac, power, s, waveform, becomes, full, wave, rectified, sine, and, its, fundamental, frequency, is, double, of, the, one, of, the, voltage, s, to, illustrate, these, concepts, consider, a, 230, v, ac, mains, supply, used, in, many, countries, around, the, world, it, is, so, called, because, its, root, mean, square, value, is, 230, v, this, means, that, the, time, averaged, power, delivered, p, average, displaystyle, p, text, average, is, equivalent, to, the, power, delivered, by, a, dc, voltage, of, 230, v, to, determine, the, peak, voltage, amplitude, we, can, rearrange, the, above, equation, to, for, 230, v, ac, the, peak, voltage, v, peak, displaystyle, v, text, peak, is, therefore, 230, v, 2, displaystyle, 230, text, v, times, sqrt, 2, which, is, about, 325, v, and, the, peak, power, p, peak, displaystyle, p, text, peak, is, 230, r, w, 2, displaystyle, 230, times, r, times, w, times, 2, that, is, 460, rw, during, the, course, of, one, cycle, two, cycle, as, the, power, the, voltage, rises, from, zero, to, 325, v, the, power, from, zero, to, 460, rw, and, both, falls, through, zero, next, the, voltage, descends, to, reverse, direction, 325, v, but, the, power, ascends, again, to, 460, rw, and, both, returns, to, zero, alternating, current, is, used, to, transmit, information, as, in, the, cases, of, telephone, and, cable, television, information, signals, are, carried, over, a, wide, range, of, ac, frequencies, pots, telephone, signals, have, a, frequency, of, about, 3, khz, close, to, the, baseband, audio, frequency, cable, television, and, other, cable, transmitted, information, currents, may, alternate, at, frequencies, of, tens, to, thousands, of, megahertz, these, frequencies, are, similar, to, the, electromagnetic, wave, frequencies, often, used, to, transmit, the, same, types, of, information, over, the, air, the, first, alternator, to, produce, alternating, current, was, an, electric, generator, based, on, michael, faraday, s, principles, constructed, by, the, french, instrument, maker, hippolyte, pixii, in, 1832, pixii, later, added, a, commutator, to, his, device, to, produce, the, then, more, commonly, used, direct, current, the, earliest, recorded, practical, application, of, alternating, current, is, by, guillaume, duchenne, inventor, and, developer, of, electrotherapy, in, 1855, he, announced, that, ac, was, superior, to, direct, current, for, electrotherapeutic, triggering, of, muscle, contractions, alternating, current, technology, was, developed, further, by, the, hungarian, ganz, works, company, 1870s, and, in, the, 1880s, sebastian, ziani, de, ferranti, lucien, gaulard, and, galileo, ferraris, in, 1876, russian, engineer, pavel, yablochkov, invented, a, lighting, system, where, sets, of, induction, coils, were, installed, along, a, high, voltage, ac, line, instead, of, changing, voltage, the, primary, windings, transferred, power, to, the, secondary, windings, which, were, connected, to, one, or, several, electric, candles, arc, lamps, of, his, own, design, used, to, keep, the, failure, of, one, lamp, from, disabling, the, entire, circuit, in, 1878, the, ganz, factory, budapest, hungary, began, manufacturing, equipment, for, electric, lighting, and, by, 1883, had, installed, over, fifty, systems, in, austria, hungary, their, ac, systems, used, arc, and, incandescent, lamps, generators, and, other, equipment, alternating, current, systems, can, use, transformers, to, change, voltage, from, low, to, high, level, and, back, allowing, generation, and, consumption, at, low, voltages, but, transmission, possibly, over, great, distances, at, high, voltage, with, savings, in, the, cost, of, conductors, and, energy, losses, a, bipolar, open, core, power, transformer, developed, by, lucien, gaulard, and, john, dixon, gibbs, was, demonstrated, in, london, in, 1881, and, attracted, the, interest, of, westinghouse, they, also, exhibited, the, invention, in, turin, in, 1884, however, these, early, induction, coils, with, open, magnetic, circuits, are, inefficient, at, transferring, power, to, loads, until, about, 1880, the, paradigm, for, ac, power, transmission, from, a, high, voltage, supply, to, a, low, voltage, load, was, a, series, circuit, open, core, transformers, with, a, ratio, near, 1, 1, were, connected, with, their, primaries, in, series, to, allow, use, of, a, high, voltage, for, transmission, while, presenting, a, low, voltage, to, the, lamps, the, inherent, flaw, in, this, method, was, that, turning, off, a, single, lamp, or, other, electric, device, affected, the, voltage, supplied, to, all, others, on, the, same, circuit, many, adjustable, transformer, designs, were, introduced, to, compensate, for, this, problematic, characteristic, of, the, series, circuit, including, those, employing, methods, of, adjusting, the, core, or, bypassing, the, magnetic, flux, around, part, of, a, coil, the, direct, current, systems, did, not, have, these, drawbacks, giving, it, significant, advantages, over, early, ac, systems, in, the, uk, sebastian, de, ferranti, who, had, been, developing, ac, generators, and, transformers, in, london, since, 1882, redesigned, the, ac, system, at, the, grosvenor, gallery, power, station, in, 1886, for, the, london, electric, supply, corporation, lesco, including, alternators, of, his, own, design, and, open, core, transformer, designs, with, serial, connections, for, utilization, loads, similar, to, gaulard, and, gibbs, in, 1890, he, designed, their, power, station, at, deptford, and, converted, the, grosvenor, gallery, station, across, the, thames, into, an, electrical, substation, showing, the, way, to, integrate, older, plants, into, a, universal, ac, supply, system, in, the, autumn, of, 1884, k, roly, zipernowsky, ott, bl, thy, and, miksa, d, ri, zbd, three, engineers, associated, with, the, ganz, works, of, budapest, determined, that, open, core, devices, were, impractical, as, they, were, incapable, of, reliably, regulating, voltage, bl, thy, had, suggested, the, use, of, closed, cores, zipernowsky, had, suggested, the, use, of, parallel, shunt, connections, and, d, ri, had, performed, the, experiments, in, their, joint, 1885, patent, applications, for, novel, transformers, later, called, zbd, transformers, they, described, two, designs, with, closed, magnetic, circuits, where, copper, windings, were, either, wound, around, a, ring, core, of, iron, wires, or, else, surrounded, by, a, core, of, iron, wires, in, both, designs, the, magnetic, flux, linking, the, primary, and, secondary, windings, traveled, almost, entirely, within, the, confines, of, the, iron, core, with, no, intentional, path, through, air, see, toroidal, cores, the, new, transformers, were, 3, 4, times, more, efficient, than, the, open, core, bipolar, devices, of, gaulard, and, gibbs, the, ganz, factory, in, 1884, shipped, the, world, s, first, five, high, efficiency, ac, transformers, this, first, unit, had, been, manufactured, to, the, following, specifications, 1, 400, w, 40, hz, 120, 72, v, 11, 6, 19, 4, a, ratio, 1, 67, 1, one, phase, shell, form, the, zbd, patents, included, two, other, major, interrelated, innovations, one, concerning, the, use, of, parallel, connected, instead, of, series, connected, utilization, loads, the, other, concerning, the, ability, to, have, high, turns, ratio, transformers, such, that, the, supply, network, voltage, could, be, much, higher, initially, 1400, v, to, 2000, v, than, the, voltage, of, utilization, loads, 100, v, initially, preferred, when, employed, in, parallel, connected, electric, distribution, systems, closed, core, transformers, finally, made, it, technically, and, economically, feasible, to, provide, electric, power, for, lighting, in, homes, businesses, and, public, spaces, the, other, essential, milestone, was, the, introduction, of, voltage, source, voltage, intensive, vsvi, systems, by, the, invention, of, constant, voltage, generators, in, 1885, in, early, 1885, the, three, engineers, also, eliminated, the, problem, of, eddy, current, losses, with, the, invention, of, the, lamination, of, electromagnetic, cores, ott, bl, thy, also, invented, the, first, ac, electricity, meter, the, ac, power, system, was, developed, and, adopted, rapidly, after, 1886, due, to, its, ability, to, distribute, electricity, efficiently, over, long, distances, overcoming, the, limitations, of, the, direct, current, system, in, 1886, the, zbd, engineers, designed, the, world, s, first, power, station, that, used, ac, generators, to, power, a, parallel, connected, common, electrical, network, the, steam, powered, rome, cerchi, power, plant, the, reliability, of, the, ac, technology, received, impetus, after, the, ganz, works, electrified, a, large, european, metropolis, rome, in, 1886, building, on, the, advancement, of, ac, technology, in, europe, george, westinghouse, founded, the, westinghouse, electric, in, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, on, january, 8, 1886, the, new, firm, became, active, in, developing, alternating, current, ac, electric, infrastructure, throughout, the, united, states, the, edison, electric, light, company, held, an, option, on, the, us, rights, for, the, ganz, zbd, transformers, requiring, westinghouse, to, pursue, alternative, designs, on, the, same, principles, george, westinghouse, had, bought, gaulard, and, gibbs, patents, for, 50, 000, in, february, 1886, he, assigned, to, william, stanley, the, task, of, redesigning, the, gaulard, and, gibbs, transformer, for, commercial, use, in, united, states, on, march, 20, 1886, stanley, conducted, a, demonstrative, experiment, in, great, barrington, a, siemens, generator, s, voltage, of, 500, volts, was, converted, into, 3000, volts, and, then, the, voltage, was, stepped, down, to, 500, volts, by, six, westinghouse, transformers, with, this, setup, the, westinghouse, company, successfully, powered, thirty, 100, volt, incandescent, bulbs, in, twenty, shops, along, the, main, street, of, great, barrington, the, spread, of, westinghouse, and, other, ac, systems, triggered, a, push, back, in, late, 1887, by, thomas, edison, a, proponent, of, direct, current, who, attempted, to, discredit, alternating, current, as, too, dangerous, in, a, public, campaign, called, the, war, of, the, currents, in, 1888, alternating, current, systems, gained, further, viability, with, introduction, of, a, functional, ac, motor, something, these, systems, had, lacked, up, till, then, the, design, an, induction, motor, was, independently, invented, by, galileo, ferraris, and, nikola, tesla, with, tesla, s, design, being, licensed, by, westinghouse, in, the, us, this, design, was, independently, further, developed, into, the, modern, practical, three, phase, form, by, mikhail, dolivo, dobrovolsky, and, charles, eugene, lancelot, brown, in, germany, on, one, side, and, jonas, wenstr, m, in, sweden, on, the, other, though, brown, favoured, the, two, phase, system, the, ames, hydroelectric, generating, plant, and, the, original, niagara, falls, adams, power, plant, were, among, the, first, hydroelectric, alternating, current, power, plants, the, first, long, distance, transmission, of, single, phase, electricity, was, from, a, hydroelectric, generating, plant, in, oregon, at, willamette, falls, which, in, 1890, sent, power, fourteen, miles, downriver, to, downtown, portland, for, street, lighting, in, 1891, a, second, transmission, system, was, installed, in, telluride, colorado, the, san, antonio, canyon, generator, was, the, third, commercial, single, phase, hydroelectric, ac, power, plant, in, the, united, states, to, provide, long, distance, electricity, it, was, completed, on, december, 31, 1892, by, almarian, william, decker, to, provide, power, to, the, city, of, pomona, california, which, was, 14, miles, away, meanwhile, the, possibility, of, transferring, electrical, power, from, a, waterfall, at, a, distance, was, explored, at, the, gr, ngesberg, mine, in, sweden, a, 45, m, fall, at, h, llsj, n, smedjebackens, kommun, where, a, small, iron, work, had, been, located, was, selected, in, 1893, a, three, phase, 9, 5, kv, system, was, used, to, transfer, 400, horsepower, a, distance, of, 15, km, becoming, the, first, commercial, application, in, 1893, decker, designed, the, first, american, commercial, three, phase, power, plant, using, alternating, current, the, hydroelectric, mill, creek, no, 1, hydroelectric, plant, near, redlands, california, decker, s, design, incorporated, 10, kv, three, phase, transmission, and, established, the, standards, for, the, complete, system, of, generation, transmission, and, motors, used, in, usa, today, the, jaruga, hydroelectric, power, plant, in, croatia, was, set, in, operation, on, 28, august, 1895, the, two, generators, 42, hz, 550, kw, each, and, the, transformers, were, produced, and, installed, by, the, hungarian, company, ganz, the, transmission, line, from, the, power, plant, to, the, city, of, ibenik, was, 11, 5, kilometers, 7, 1, mi, long, on, wooden, towers, and, the, municipal, distribution, grid, 3000, v, 110, v, included, six, transforming, stations, alternating, current, circuit, theory, developed, rapidly, in, the, latter, part, of, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, notable, contributors, to, the, theoretical, basis, of, alternating, current, calculations, include, charles, steinmetz, oliver, heaviside, and, many, others, calculations, in, unbalanced, three, phase, systems, were, simplified, by, the, symmetrical, components, methods, discussed, by, charles, legeyt, fortescue, in, 1918
