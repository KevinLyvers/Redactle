the, universe, is, all, of, space, and, time, and, their, contents, it, comprises, all, of, existence, any, fundamental, interaction, physical, process, and, physical, constant, and, therefore, all, forms, of, matter, and, energy, and, the, structures, they, form, from, sub, atomic, particles, to, entire, galactic, filaments, space, and, time, according, to, the, prevailing, cosmological, theory, of, the, big, bang, emerged, together, 13, 787, 0, 020, billion, years, ago, and, the, universe, has, been, expanding, ever, since, today, the, universe, has, expanded, into, an, age, and, size, that, is, physically, only, in, parts, observable, as, the, observable, universe, which, is, approximately, 93, billion, light, years, in, diameter, at, the, present, day, while, the, spatial, size, if, any, of, the, entire, universe, is, unknown, some, of, the, earliest, cosmological, models, of, the, universe, were, developed, by, ancient, greek, and, indian, philosophers, and, were, geocentric, placing, earth, at, the, center, over, the, centuries, more, precise, astronomical, observations, led, nicolaus, copernicus, to, develop, the, heliocentric, model, with, the, sun, at, the, center, of, the, solar, system, in, developing, the, law, of, universal, gravitation, isaac, newton, built, upon, copernicus, s, work, as, well, as, johannes, kepler, s, laws, of, planetary, motion, and, observations, by, tycho, brahe, further, observational, improvements, led, to, the, realization, that, the, sun, is, one, of, a, few, hundred, billion, stars, in, the, milky, way, which, is, one, of, a, few, hundred, billion, galaxies, in, the, observable, universe, many, of, the, stars, in, a, galaxy, have, planets, at, the, largest, scale, galaxies, are, distributed, uniformly, and, the, same, in, all, directions, meaning, that, the, universe, has, neither, an, edge, nor, a, center, at, smaller, scales, galaxies, are, distributed, in, clusters, and, superclusters, which, form, immense, filaments, and, voids, in, space, creating, a, vast, foam, like, structure, discoveries, in, the, early, 20th, century, have, suggested, that, the, universe, had, a, beginning, and, has, been, expanding, since, then, according, to, the, big, bang, theory, the, energy, and, matter, initially, present, have, become, less, dense, as, the, universe, expanded, after, an, initial, accelerated, expansion, called, the, inflationary, epoch, at, around, 10, 32, seconds, and, the, separation, of, the, four, known, fundamental, forces, the, universe, gradually, cooled, and, continued, to, expand, allowing, the, first, subatomic, particles, and, simple, atoms, to, form, giant, clouds, of, hydrogen, and, helium, were, gradually, drawn, to, the, places, where, matter, was, most, dense, forming, the, first, galaxies, stars, and, everything, else, seen, today, from, studying, the, effects, of, gravity, on, both, matter, and, light, it, has, been, discovered, that, the, universe, contains, much, more, matter, than, is, accounted, for, by, visible, objects, stars, galaxies, nebulas, and, interstellar, gas, this, unseen, matter, is, known, as, dark, matter, dark, means, that, there, is, a, wide, range, of, strong, indirect, evidence, that, it, exists, but, we, have, not, yet, detected, it, directly, having, come, into, existence, alongside, the, rest, of, the, physical, universe, before, gradually, gathering, into, a, foam, like, structure, of, filaments, and, voids, and, allowing, other, forms, of, matter, to, form, together, into, visible, structures, the, cdm, model, is, the, most, widely, accepted, model, of, the, universe, it, suggests, that, about, 69, 2, 1, 2, of, the, mass, and, energy, in, the, universe, is, dark, energy, which, is, responsible, for, the, acceleration, of, the, expansion, of, the, universe, and, about, 25, 8, 1, 1, is, dark, matter, ordinary, baryonic, matter, is, therefore, only, 4, 84, 0, 1, of, the, physical, universe, stars, planets, and, visible, gas, clouds, only, form, about, 6, of, the, ordinary, matter, there, are, many, competing, hypotheses, about, the, ultimate, fate, of, the, universe, and, about, what, if, anything, preceded, the, big, bang, while, other, physicists, and, philosophers, refuse, to, speculate, doubting, that, information, about, prior, states, will, ever, be, accessible, some, physicists, have, suggested, various, multiverse, hypotheses, in, which, the, universe, might, be, one, among, many, the, physical, universe, is, defined, as, all, of, space, and, time, collectively, referred, to, as, spacetime, and, their, contents, such, contents, comprise, all, of, energy, in, its, various, forms, including, electromagnetic, radiation, and, matter, and, therefore, planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and, the, contents, of, intergalactic, space, the, universe, also, includes, the, physical, laws, that, influence, energy, and, matter, such, as, conservation, laws, classical, mechanics, and, relativity, the, universe, is, often, defined, as, the, totality, of, existence, or, everything, that, exists, everything, that, has, existed, and, everything, that, will, exist, in, fact, some, philosophers, and, scientists, support, the, inclusion, of, ideas, and, abstract, concepts, such, as, mathematics, and, logic, in, the, definition, of, the, universe, the, word, universe, may, also, refer, to, concepts, such, as, the, cosmos, the, world, and, nature, the, word, universe, derives, from, the, old, french, word, univers, which, in, turn, derives, from, the, latin, word, universus, meaning, combined, into, one, the, latin, word, universum, was, used, by, cicero, and, later, latin, authors, in, many, of, the, same, senses, as, the, modern, english, word, is, used, a, term, for, universe, among, the, ancient, greek, philosophers, from, pythagoras, onwards, was, t, p, n, the, all, defined, as, all, matter, and, all, space, and, t, h, lon, all, things, which, did, not, necessarily, include, the, void, another, synonym, was, ho, k, smos, meaning, the, world, the, cosmos, synonyms, are, also, found, in, latin, authors, totum, mundus, natura, and, survive, in, modern, languages, e, g, the, german, words, das, all, weltall, and, natur, for, universe, the, same, synonyms, are, found, in, english, such, as, everything, as, in, the, theory, of, everything, the, cosmos, as, in, cosmology, the, world, as, in, the, many, worlds, interpretation, and, nature, as, in, natural, laws, or, natural, philosophy, the, prevailing, model, for, the, evolution, of, the, universe, is, the, big, bang, theory, the, big, bang, model, states, that, the, earliest, state, of, the, universe, was, an, extremely, hot, and, dense, one, and, that, the, universe, subsequently, expanded, and, cooled, the, model, is, based, on, general, relativity, and, on, simplifying, assumptions, such, as, the, homogeneity, and, isotropy, of, space, a, version, of, the, model, with, a, cosmological, constant, lambda, and, cold, dark, matter, known, as, the, lambda, cdm, model, is, the, simplest, model, that, provides, a, reasonably, good, account, of, various, observations, about, the, universe, the, initial, hot, dense, state, is, called, the, planck, epoch, a, brief, period, extending, from, time, zero, to, one, planck, time, unit, of, approximately, 10, 43, seconds, during, the, planck, epoch, all, types, of, matter, and, all, types, of, energy, were, concentrated, into, a, dense, state, and, gravity, currently, the, weakest, by, far, of, the, four, known, forces, is, believed, to, have, been, as, strong, as, the, other, fundamental, forces, and, all, the, forces, may, have, been, unified, the, physics, controlling, this, very, early, period, including, quantum, gravity, in, the, planck, epoch, is, not, understood, so, we, cannot, say, what, if, anything, happened, before, time, zero, since, the, planck, epoch, the, universe, has, been, expanding, to, its, present, scale, with, a, very, short, but, intense, period, of, cosmic, inflation, speculated, to, have, occurred, within, the, first, 10, 32, seconds, this, initial, period, of, inflation, would, explain, why, space, appears, to, be, very, flat, within, the, first, fraction, of, a, second, of, the, universe, s, existence, the, four, fundamental, forces, had, separated, as, the, universe, continued, to, cool, from, its, inconceivably, hot, state, various, types, of, subatomic, particles, were, able, to, form, in, short, periods, of, time, known, as, the, quark, epoch, the, hadron, epoch, and, the, lepton, epoch, together, these, epochs, encompassed, less, than, 10, seconds, of, time, following, the, big, bang, these, elementary, particles, associated, stably, into, ever, larger, combinations, including, stable, protons, and, neutrons, which, then, formed, more, complex, atomic, nuclei, through, nuclear, fusion, this, process, known, as, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, lasted, for, about, 17, minutes, and, ended, about, 20, minutes, after, the, big, bang, so, only, the, fastest, and, simplest, reactions, occurred, about, 25, of, the, protons, and, all, the, neutrons, in, the, universe, by, mass, were, converted, to, helium, with, small, amounts, of, deuterium, a, form, of, hydrogen, and, traces, of, lithium, any, other, element, was, only, formed, in, very, tiny, quantities, the, other, 75, of, the, protons, remained, unaffected, as, hydrogen, nuclei, 27, 42, after, nucleosynthesis, ended, the, universe, entered, a, period, known, as, the, photon, epoch, during, this, period, the, universe, was, still, far, too, hot, for, matter, to, form, neutral, atoms, so, it, contained, a, hot, dense, foggy, plasma, of, negatively, charged, electrons, neutral, neutrinos, and, positive, nuclei, after, about, 377, 000, years, the, universe, had, cooled, enough, that, electrons, and, nuclei, could, form, the, first, stable, atoms, this, is, known, as, recombination, for, historical, reasons, electrons, and, nuclei, were, combining, for, the, first, time, unlike, plasma, neutral, atoms, are, transparent, to, many, wavelengths, of, light, so, for, the, first, time, the, universe, also, became, transparent, the, photons, released, decoupled, when, these, atoms, formed, can, still, be, seen, today, they, form, the, cosmic, microwave, background, cmb, 15, 27, as, the, universe, expands, the, energy, density, of, electromagnetic, radiation, decreases, more, quickly, than, does, that, of, matter, because, the, energy, of, each, photon, decreases, as, it, is, cosmologically, redshifted, at, around, 47, 000, years, the, energy, density, of, matter, became, larger, than, that, of, photons, and, neutrinos, and, began, to, dominate, the, large, scale, behavior, of, the, universe, this, marked, the, end, of, the, radiation, dominated, era, and, the, start, of, the, matter, dominated, era, 390, in, the, earliest, stages, of, the, universe, tiny, fluctuations, within, the, universe, s, density, led, to, concentrations, of, dark, matter, gradually, forming, ordinary, matter, attracted, to, these, by, gravity, formed, large, gas, clouds, and, eventually, stars, and, galaxies, where, the, dark, matter, was, most, dense, and, voids, where, it, was, least, dense, after, around, 100, 300, million, years, 333, the, first, stars, formed, known, as, population, iii, stars, these, were, probably, very, massive, luminous, non, metallic, and, short, lived, they, were, responsible, for, the, gradual, reionization, of, the, universe, between, about, 200, 500, million, years, and, 1, billion, years, and, also, for, seeding, the, universe, with, elements, heavier, than, helium, through, stellar, nucleosynthesis, the, universe, also, contains, a, mysterious, energy, possibly, a, scalar, field, called, dark, energy, the, density, of, which, does, not, change, over, time, after, about, 9, 8, billion, years, the, universe, had, expanded, sufficiently, so, that, the, density, of, matter, was, less, than, the, density, of, dark, energy, marking, the, beginning, of, the, present, dark, energy, dominated, era, in, this, era, the, expansion, of, the, universe, is, accelerating, due, to, dark, energy, of, the, four, fundamental, interactions, gravitation, is, the, dominant, at, astronomical, length, scales, gravity, s, effects, are, cumulative, by, contrast, the, effects, of, positive, and, negative, charges, tend, to, cancel, one, another, making, electromagnetism, relatively, insignificant, on, astronomical, length, scales, the, remaining, two, interactions, the, weak, and, strong, nuclear, forces, decline, very, rapidly, with, distance, their, effects, are, confined, mainly, to, sub, atomic, length, scales, 1470, the, universe, appears, to, have, much, more, matter, than, antimatter, an, asymmetry, possibly, related, to, the, cp, violation, this, imbalance, between, matter, and, antimatter, is, partially, responsible, for, the, existence, of, all, matter, existing, today, since, matter, and, antimatter, if, equally, produced, at, the, big, bang, would, have, completely, annihilated, each, other, and, left, only, photons, as, a, result, of, their, interaction, these, laws, are, gauss, s, law, and, the, non, divergence, of, the, stress, energy, momentum, pseudotensor, according, to, the, general, theory, of, relativity, far, regions, of, space, may, never, interact, with, ours, even, in, the, lifetime, of, the, universe, due, to, the, finite, speed, of, light, and, the, ongoing, expansion, of, space, for, example, radio, messages, sent, from, earth, may, never, reach, some, regions, of, space, even, if, the, universe, were, to, exist, forever, space, may, expand, faster, than, light, can, traverse, it, the, spatial, region, that, can, be, observed, with, telescopes, is, called, the, observable, universe, which, depends, on, the, location, of, the, observer, the, proper, distance, the, distance, as, would, be, measured, at, a, specific, time, including, the, present, between, earth, and, the, edge, of, the, observable, universe, is, 46, billion, light, years, 14, billion, parsecs, making, the, diameter, of, the, observable, universe, about, 93, billion, light, years, 28, billion, parsecs, the, distance, the, light, from, the, edge, of, the, observable, universe, has, traveled, is, very, close, to, the, age, of, the, universe, times, the, speed, of, light, 13, 8, billion, light, years, 4, 2, 10, 9, pc, but, this, does, not, represent, the, distance, at, any, given, time, because, the, edge, of, the, observable, universe, and, the, earth, have, since, moved, further, apart, for, comparison, the, diameter, of, a, typical, galaxy, is, 30, 000, light, years, 9, 198, parsecs, and, the, typical, distance, between, two, neighboring, galaxies, is, 3, million, light, years, 919, 8, kiloparsecs, as, an, example, the, milky, way, is, roughly, 100, 000, 180, 000, light, years, in, diameter, and, the, nearest, sister, galaxy, to, the, milky, way, the, andromeda, galaxy, is, located, roughly, 2, 5, million, light, years, away, because, humans, cannot, observe, space, beyond, the, edge, of, the, observable, universe, it, is, unknown, whether, the, size, of, the, universe, in, its, totality, is, finite, or, infinite, estimates, suggest, that, the, whole, universe, if, finite, must, be, more, than, 250, times, larger, than, a, hubble, sphere, some, disputed, estimates, for, the, total, size, of, the, universe, if, finite, reach, as, high, as, 10, 10, 10, 122, displaystyle, 10, 10, 10, 122, megaparsecs, as, implied, by, a, suggested, resolution, of, the, no, boundary, proposal, assuming, that, the, lambda, cdm, model, is, correct, the, measurements, of, the, parameters, using, a, variety, of, techniques, by, numerous, experiments, yield, a, best, value, of, the, age, of, the, universe, at, 13, 799, 0, 021, billion, years, as, of, 2015, over, time, the, universe, and, its, contents, have, evolved, for, example, the, relative, population, of, quasars, and, galaxies, has, changed, and, the, universe, has, expanded, this, expansion, is, inferred, from, the, observation, that, the, light, from, distant, galaxies, has, been, redshifted, which, implies, that, the, galaxies, are, receding, from, us, analyses, of, type, ia, supernovae, indicate, that, the, expansion, is, accelerating, the, more, matter, there, is, in, the, universe, the, stronger, the, mutual, gravitational, pull, of, the, matter, if, the, universe, were, too, dense, then, it, would, re, collapse, into, a, gravitational, singularity, however, if, the, universe, contained, too, little, matter, then, the, self, gravity, would, be, too, weak, for, astronomical, structures, like, galaxies, or, planets, to, form, since, the, big, bang, the, universe, has, expanded, monotonically, perhaps, unsurprisingly, our, universe, has, just, the, right, mass, energy, density, equivalent, to, about, 5, protons, per, cubic, meter, which, has, allowed, it, to, expand, for, the, last, 13, 8, billion, years, giving, time, to, form, the, universe, as, observed, today, there, are, dynamical, forces, acting, on, the, particles, in, the, universe, which, affect, the, expansion, rate, before, 1998, it, was, expected, that, the, expansion, rate, would, be, decreasing, as, time, went, on, due, to, the, influence, of, gravitational, interactions, in, the, universe, and, thus, there, is, an, additional, observable, quantity, in, the, universe, called, the, deceleration, parameter, which, most, cosmologists, expected, to, be, positive, and, related, to, the, matter, density, of, the, universe, in, 1998, the, deceleration, parameter, was, measured, by, two, different, groups, to, be, negative, approximately, 0, 55, which, technically, implies, that, the, second, derivative, of, the, cosmic, scale, factor, a, displaystyle, ddot, a, has, been, positive, in, the, last, 5, 6, billion, years, modern, physics, regards, events, as, being, organized, into, spacetime, this, idea, originated, with, the, special, theory, of, relativity, which, predicts, that, if, one, observer, sees, two, events, happening, in, different, places, at, the, same, time, a, second, observer, who, is, moving, relative, to, the, first, will, see, those, events, happening, at, different, times, 45, 52, the, two, observers, will, disagree, on, the, time, t, displaystyle, t, between, the, events, and, they, will, disagree, about, the, distance, d, displaystyle, d, separating, the, events, but, they, will, agree, on, the, speed, of, light, c, displaystyle, c, and, they, will, measure, the, same, value, for, the, combination, c, 2, t, 2, d, 2, displaystyle, c, 2, t, 2, d, 2, 80, the, square, root, of, the, absolute, value, of, this, quantity, is, called, the, interval, between, the, two, events, the, interval, expresses, how, widely, separated, events, are, not, just, in, space, or, in, time, but, in, the, combined, setting, of, spacetime, 84, 136, the, special, theory, of, relativity, cannot, account, for, gravity, its, successor, the, general, theory, of, relativity, explains, gravity, by, recognizing, that, spacetime, is, not, fixed, but, instead, dynamical, in, general, relativity, gravitational, force, is, reimagined, as, curvature, of, spacetime, a, curved, path, like, an, orbit, is, not, the, result, of, a, force, deflecting, a, body, from, an, ideal, straight, line, path, but, rather, the, body, s, attempt, to, fall, freely, through, a, background, that, is, itself, curved, by, the, presence, of, other, masses, a, remark, by, john, archibald, wheeler, that, has, become, proverbial, among, physicists, summarizes, the, theory, spacetime, tells, matter, how, to, move, matter, tells, spacetime, how, to, curve, and, therefore, there, is, no, point, in, considering, one, without, the, other, the, newtonian, theory, of, gravity, is, a, good, approximation, to, the, predictions, of, general, relativity, when, gravitational, effects, are, weak, and, objects, are, moving, slowly, compared, to, the, speed, of, light, 327, the, relation, between, matter, distribution, and, spacetime, curvature, is, given, by, the, einstein, field, equations, which, require, tensor, calculus, to, express, 43, the, universe, appears, to, be, a, smooth, spacetime, continuum, consisting, of, three, spatial, dimensions, and, one, temporal, time, dimension, therefore, an, event, in, the, spacetime, of, the, physical, universe, can, be, identified, by, a, set, of, four, coordinates, x, y, z, t, on, average, space, is, observed, to, be, very, nearly, flat, with, a, curvature, close, to, zero, meaning, that, euclidean, geometry, is, empirically, true, with, high, accuracy, throughout, most, of, the, universe, spacetime, also, appears, to, have, a, simply, connected, topology, in, analogy, with, a, sphere, at, least, on, the, length, scale, of, the, observable, universe, however, present, observations, cannot, exclude, the, possibilities, that, the, universe, has, more, dimensions, which, is, postulated, by, theories, such, as, the, string, theory, and, that, its, spacetime, may, have, a, multiply, connected, global, topology, in, analogy, with, the, cylindrical, or, toroidal, topologies, of, two, dimensional, spaces, general, relativity, describes, how, spacetime, is, curved, and, bent, by, mass, and, energy, gravity, the, topology, or, geometry, of, the, universe, includes, both, local, geometry, in, the, observable, universe, and, global, geometry, cosmologists, often, work, with, a, given, space, like, slice, of, spacetime, called, the, comoving, coordinates, the, section, of, spacetime, which, can, be, observed, is, the, backward, light, cone, which, delimits, the, cosmological, horizon, the, cosmological, horizon, also, called, the, particle, horizon, or, the, light, horizon, is, the, maximum, distance, from, which, particles, can, have, traveled, to, the, observer, in, the, age, of, the, universe, this, horizon, represents, the, boundary, between, the, observable, and, the, unobservable, regions, of, the, universe, an, important, parameter, determining, the, future, evolution, of, the, universe, theory, is, the, density, parameter, omega, defined, as, the, average, matter, density, of, the, universe, divided, by, a, critical, value, of, that, density, this, selects, one, of, three, possible, geometries, depending, on, whether, is, equal, to, less, than, or, greater, than, 1, these, are, called, respectively, the, flat, open, and, closed, universes, observations, including, the, cosmic, background, explorer, cobe, wilkinson, microwave, anisotropy, probe, wmap, and, planck, maps, of, the, cmb, suggest, that, the, universe, is, infinite, in, extent, with, a, finite, age, as, described, by, the, friedmann, lema, tre, robertson, walker, flrw, models, these, flrw, models, thus, support, inflationary, models, and, the, standard, model, of, cosmology, describing, a, flat, homogeneous, universe, presently, dominated, by, dark, matter, and, dark, energy, the, fine, tuned, universe, hypothesis, is, the, proposition, that, the, conditions, that, allow, the, existence, of, observable, life, in, the, universe, can, only, occur, when, certain, universal, fundamental, physical, constants, lie, within, a, very, narrow, range, of, values, according, to, this, hypothesis, if, any, of, several, fundamental, constants, were, only, slightly, different, the, universe, would, have, been, unlikely, to, be, conducive, to, the, establishment, and, development, of, matter, astronomical, structures, elemental, diversity, or, life, as, it, is, understood, whether, this, is, true, and, whether, that, question, is, even, logically, meaningful, to, ask, are, subjects, of, much, debate, the, proposition, is, discussed, among, philosophers, scientists, theologians, and, proponents, of, creationism, the, universe, is, composed, almost, completely, of, dark, energy, dark, matter, and, ordinary, matter, other, contents, are, electromagnetic, radiation, estimated, to, constitute, from, 0, 005, to, close, to, 0, 01, of, the, total, mass, energy, of, the, universe, and, antimatter, the, proportions, of, all, types, of, matter, and, energy, have, changed, over, the, history, of, the, universe, the, total, amount, of, electromagnetic, radiation, generated, within, the, universe, has, decreased, by, 1, 2, in, the, past, 2, billion, years, today, ordinary, matter, which, includes, atoms, stars, galaxies, and, life, accounts, for, only, 4, 9, of, the, contents, of, the, universe, the, present, overall, density, of, this, type, of, matter, is, very, low, roughly, 4, 5, 10, 31, grams, per, cubic, centimeter, corresponding, to, a, density, of, the, order, of, only, one, proton, for, every, four, cubic, meters, of, volume, the, nature, of, both, dark, energy, and, dark, matter, is, unknown, dark, matter, a, mysterious, form, of, matter, that, has, not, yet, been, identified, accounts, for, 26, 8, of, the, cosmic, contents, dark, energy, which, is, the, energy, of, empty, space, and, is, causing, the, expansion, of, the, universe, to, accelerate, accounts, for, the, remaining, 68, 3, of, the, contents, matter, dark, matter, and, dark, energy, are, distributed, homogeneously, throughout, the, universe, over, length, scales, longer, than, 300, million, light, years, ly, or, so, however, over, shorter, length, scales, matter, tends, to, clump, hierarchically, many, atoms, are, condensed, into, stars, most, stars, into, galaxies, most, galaxies, into, clusters, superclusters, and, finally, large, scale, galactic, filaments, the, observable, universe, contains, as, many, as, an, estimated, 2, trillion, galaxies, and, overall, as, many, as, an, estimated, 10, 24, stars, more, stars, and, earth, like, planets, than, all, the, grains, of, beach, sand, on, planet, earth, but, less, than, the, total, number, of, atoms, estimated, in, the, universe, as, 10, 82, and, the, estimated, total, number, of, stars, in, an, inflationary, universe, observed, and, unobserved, as, 10, 100, typical, galaxies, range, from, dwarfs, with, as, few, as, ten, million, 10, 7, stars, up, to, giants, with, one, trillion, 10, 12, stars, between, the, larger, structures, are, voids, which, are, typically, 10, 150, mpc, 33, million, 490, million, ly, in, diameter, the, milky, way, is, in, the, local, group, of, galaxies, which, in, turn, is, in, the, laniakea, supercluster, this, supercluster, spans, over, 500, million, light, years, while, the, local, group, spans, over, 10, million, light, years, the, universe, also, has, vast, regions, of, relative, emptiness, the, largest, known, void, measures, 1, 8, billion, ly, 550, mpc, across, the, observable, universe, is, isotropic, on, scales, significantly, larger, than, superclusters, meaning, that, the, statistical, properties, of, the, universe, are, the, same, in, all, directions, as, observed, from, earth, the, universe, is, bathed, in, highly, isotropic, microwave, radiation, that, corresponds, to, a, thermal, equilibrium, blackbody, spectrum, of, roughly, 2, 72548, kelvins, the, hypothesis, that, the, large, scale, universe, is, homogeneous, and, isotropic, is, known, as, the, cosmological, principle, a, universe, that, is, both, homogeneous, and, isotropic, looks, the, same, from, all, vantage, points, and, has, no, center, an, explanation, for, why, the, expansion, of, the, universe, is, accelerating, remains, elusive, it, is, often, attributed, to, dark, energy, an, unknown, form, of, energy, that, is, hypothesized, to, permeate, space, on, a, mass, energy, equivalence, basis, the, density, of, dark, energy, 7, 10, 30, g, cm, 3, is, much, less, than, the, density, of, ordinary, matter, or, dark, matter, within, galaxies, however, in, the, present, dark, energy, era, it, dominates, the, mass, energy, of, the, universe, because, it, is, uniform, across, space, two, proposed, forms, for, dark, energy, are, the, cosmological, constant, a, constant, energy, density, filling, space, homogeneously, and, scalar, fields, such, as, quintessence, or, moduli, dynamic, quantities, whose, energy, density, can, vary, in, time, and, space, while, still, permeating, then, enough, to, cause, the, observed, rate, of, expansion, contributions, from, scalar, fields, that, are, constant, in, space, are, usually, also, included, in, the, cosmological, constant, the, cosmological, constant, can, be, formulated, to, be, equivalent, to, vacuum, energy, dark, matter, is, a, hypothetical, kind, of, matter, that, is, invisible, to, the, entire, electromagnetic, spectrum, but, which, accounts, for, most, of, the, matter, in, the, universe, the, existence, and, properties, of, dark, matter, are, inferred, from, its, gravitational, effects, on, visible, matter, radiation, and, the, large, scale, structure, of, the, universe, other, than, neutrinos, a, form, of, hot, dark, matter, dark, matter, has, not, been, detected, directly, making, it, one, of, the, greatest, mysteries, in, modern, astrophysics, dark, matter, neither, emits, nor, absorbs, light, or, any, other, electromagnetic, radiation, at, any, significant, level, dark, matter, is, estimated, to, constitute, 26, 8, of, the, total, mass, energy, and, 84, 5, of, the, total, matter, in, the, universe, the, remaining, 4, 9, of, the, mass, energy, of, the, universe, is, ordinary, matter, that, is, atoms, ions, electrons, and, the, objects, they, form, this, matter, includes, stars, which, produce, nearly, all, of, the, light, we, see, from, galaxies, as, well, as, interstellar, gas, in, the, interstellar, and, intergalactic, media, planets, and, all, the, objects, from, everyday, life, that, we, can, bump, into, touch, or, squeeze, the, great, majority, of, ordinary, matter, in, the, universe, is, unseen, since, visible, stars, and, gas, inside, galaxies, and, clusters, account, for, less, than, 10, percent, of, the, ordinary, matter, contribution, to, the, mass, energy, density, of, the, universe, ordinary, matter, commonly, exists, in, four, states, or, phases, solid, liquid, gas, and, plasma, however, advances, in, experimental, techniques, have, revealed, other, previously, theoretical, phases, such, as, bose, einstein, condensates, and, fermionic, condensates, ordinary, matter, is, composed, of, two, types, of, elementary, particles, quarks, and, leptons, for, example, the, proton, is, formed, of, two, up, quarks, and, one, down, quark, the, neutron, is, formed, of, two, down, quarks, and, one, up, quark, and, the, electron, is, a, kind, of, lepton, an, atom, consists, of, an, atomic, nucleus, made, up, of, protons, and, neutrons, both, of, which, are, baryons, and, electrons, that, orbit, the, nucleus, 1476, soon, after, the, big, bang, primordial, protons, and, neutrons, formed, from, the, quark, gluon, plasma, of, the, early, universe, as, it, cooled, below, two, trillion, degrees, a, few, minutes, later, in, a, process, known, as, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, nuclei, formed, from, the, primordial, protons, and, neutrons, this, nucleosynthesis, formed, lighter, elements, those, with, small, atomic, numbers, up, to, lithium, and, beryllium, but, the, abundance, of, heavier, elements, dropped, off, sharply, with, increasing, atomic, number, some, boron, may, have, been, formed, at, this, time, but, the, next, heavier, element, carbon, was, not, formed, in, significant, amounts, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, shut, down, after, about, 20, minutes, due, to, the, rapid, drop, in, temperature, and, density, of, the, expanding, universe, subsequent, formation, of, heavier, elements, resulted, from, stellar, nucleosynthesis, and, supernova, nucleosynthesis, ordinary, matter, and, the, forces, that, act, on, matter, can, be, described, in, terms, of, elementary, particles, these, particles, are, sometimes, described, as, being, fundamental, since, they, have, an, unknown, substructure, and, it, is, unknown, whether, or, not, they, are, composed, of, smaller, and, even, more, fundamental, particles, in, most, contemporary, models, they, are, thought, of, as, points, in, space, all, elementary, particles, are, currently, best, explained, by, quantum, mechanics, and, exhibit, wave, particle, duality, their, behavior, has, both, particle, like, and, wave, like, aspects, with, different, features, dominating, under, different, circumstances, of, central, importance, is, the, standard, model, a, theory, that, is, concerned, with, electromagnetic, interactions, and, the, weak, and, strong, nuclear, interactions, the, standard, model, is, supported, by, the, experimental, confirmation, of, the, existence, of, particles, that, compose, matter, quarks, and, leptons, and, their, corresponding, antimatter, duals, as, well, as, the, force, particles, that, mediate, interactions, the, photon, the, w, and, z, bosons, and, the, gluon, the, standard, model, predicted, the, existence, of, the, recently, discovered, higgs, boson, a, particle, that, is, a, manifestation, of, a, field, within, the, universe, that, can, endow, particles, with, mass, because, of, its, success, in, explaining, a, wide, variety, of, experimental, results, the, standard, model, is, sometimes, regarded, as, a, theory, of, almost, everything, the, standard, model, does, not, however, accommodate, gravity, a, true, force, particle, theory, of, everything, has, not, been, attained, a, hadron, is, a, composite, particle, made, of, quarks, held, together, by, the, strong, force, hadrons, are, categorized, into, two, families, baryons, such, as, protons, and, neutrons, made, of, three, quarks, and, mesons, such, as, pions, made, of, one, quark, and, one, antiquark, of, the, hadrons, protons, are, stable, and, neutrons, bound, within, atomic, nuclei, are, stable, other, hadrons, are, unstable, under, ordinary, conditions, and, are, thus, insignificant, constituents, of, the, modern, universe, 118, 123, from, approximately, 10, 6, seconds, after, the, big, bang, during, a, period, known, as, the, hadron, epoch, the, temperature, of, the, universe, had, fallen, sufficiently, to, allow, quarks, to, bind, together, into, hadrons, and, the, mass, of, the, universe, was, dominated, by, hadrons, initially, the, temperature, was, high, enough, to, allow, the, formation, of, hadron, anti, hadron, pairs, which, kept, matter, and, antimatter, in, thermal, equilibrium, however, as, the, temperature, of, the, universe, continued, to, fall, hadron, anti, hadron, pairs, were, no, longer, produced, most, of, the, hadrons, and, anti, hadrons, were, then, eliminated, in, particle, antiparticle, annihilation, reactions, leaving, a, small, residual, of, hadrons, by, the, time, the, universe, was, about, one, second, old, 244, 266, a, lepton, is, an, elementary, half, integer, spin, particle, that, does, not, undergo, strong, interactions, but, is, subject, to, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, no, two, leptons, of, the, same, species, can, be, in, exactly, the, same, state, at, the, same, time, two, main, classes, of, leptons, exist, charged, leptons, also, known, as, the, electron, like, leptons, and, neutral, leptons, better, known, as, neutrinos, electrons, are, stable, and, the, most, common, charged, lepton, in, the, universe, whereas, muons, and, taus, are, unstable, particles, that, quickly, decay, after, being, produced, in, high, energy, collisions, such, as, those, involving, cosmic, rays, or, carried, out, in, particle, accelerators, charged, leptons, can, combine, with, other, particles, to, form, various, composite, particles, such, as, atoms, and, positronium, the, electron, governs, nearly, all, of, chemistry, as, it, is, found, in, atoms, and, is, directly, tied, to, all, chemical, properties, neutrinos, rarely, interact, with, anything, and, are, consequently, rarely, observed, neutrinos, stream, throughout, the, universe, but, rarely, interact, with, normal, matter, the, lepton, epoch, was, the, period, in, the, evolution, of, the, early, universe, in, which, the, leptons, dominated, the, mass, of, the, universe, it, started, roughly, 1, second, after, the, big, bang, after, the, majority, of, hadrons, and, anti, hadrons, annihilated, each, other, at, the, end, of, the, hadron, epoch, during, the, lepton, epoch, the, temperature, of, the, universe, was, still, high, enough, to, create, lepton, anti, lepton, pairs, so, leptons, and, anti, leptons, were, in, thermal, equilibrium, approximately, 10, seconds, after, the, big, bang, the, temperature, of, the, universe, had, fallen, to, the, point, where, lepton, anti, lepton, pairs, were, no, longer, created, most, leptons, and, anti, leptons, were, then, eliminated, in, annihilation, reactions, leaving, a, small, residue, of, leptons, the, mass, of, the, universe, was, then, dominated, by, photons, as, it, entered, the, following, photon, epoch, a, photon, is, the, quantum, of, light, and, all, other, forms, of, electromagnetic, radiation, it, is, the, carrier, for, the, electromagnetic, force, the, effects, of, this, force, are, easily, observable, at, the, microscopic, and, at, the, macroscopic, level, because, the, photon, has, zero, rest, mass, this, allows, long, distance, interactions, 1470, the, photon, epoch, started, after, most, leptons, and, anti, leptons, were, annihilated, at, the, end, of, the, lepton, epoch, about, 10, seconds, after, the, big, bang, atomic, nuclei, were, created, in, the, process, of, nucleosynthesis, which, occurred, during, the, first, few, minutes, of, the, photon, epoch, for, the, remainder, of, the, photon, epoch, the, universe, contained, a, hot, dense, plasma, of, nuclei, electrons, and, photons, about, 380, 000, years, after, the, big, bang, the, temperature, of, the, universe, fell, to, the, point, where, nuclei, could, combine, with, electrons, to, create, neutral, atoms, as, a, result, photons, no, longer, interacted, frequently, with, matter, and, the, universe, became, transparent, the, highly, redshifted, photons, from, this, period, form, the, cosmic, microwave, background, tiny, variations, in, temperature, and, density, detectable, in, the, cmb, were, the, early, seeds, from, which, all, subsequent, structure, formation, took, place, 244, 266, the, frequency, of, life, in, the, universe, has, been, a, frequent, point, of, investigation, in, astronomy, and, astrobiology, being, the, issue, of, the, drake, equation, and, the, different, views, on, it, from, identifying, the, fermi, paradox, the, situation, of, not, having, found, any, signs, of, extraterrestrial, life, to, arguments, for, a, biophysical, cosmology, a, view, of, life, being, inherent, to, the, physical, cosmology, of, the, universe, general, relativity, is, the, geometric, theory, of, gravitation, published, by, albert, einstein, in, 1915, and, the, current, description, of, gravitation, in, modern, physics, it, is, the, basis, of, current, cosmological, models, of, the, universe, general, relativity, generalizes, special, relativity, and, newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, providing, a, unified, description, of, gravity, as, a, geometric, property, of, space, and, time, or, spacetime, in, particular, the, curvature, of, spacetime, is, directly, related, to, the, energy, and, momentum, of, whatever, matter, and, radiation, are, present, the, relation, is, specified, by, the, einstein, field, equations, a, system, of, partial, differential, equations, in, general, relativity, the, distribution, of, matter, and, energy, determines, the, geometry, of, spacetime, which, in, turn, describes, the, acceleration, of, matter, therefore, solutions, of, the, einstein, field, equations, describe, the, evolution, of, the, universe, combined, with, measurements, of, the, amount, type, and, distribution, of, matter, in, the, universe, the, equations, of, general, relativity, describe, the, evolution, of, the, universe, over, time, with, the, assumption, of, the, cosmological, principle, that, the, universe, is, homogeneous, and, isotropic, everywhere, a, specific, solution, of, the, field, equations, that, describes, the, universe, is, the, metric, tensor, called, the, friedmann, lema, tre, robertson, walker, metric, where, r, correspond, to, a, spherical, coordinate, system, this, metric, has, only, two, undetermined, parameters, an, overall, dimensionless, length, scale, factor, r, describes, the, size, scale, of, the, universe, as, a, function, of, time, an, increase, in, r, is, the, expansion, of, the, universe, and, a, curvature, index, k, describes, the, geometry, the, index, k, is, defined, so, that, it, can, take, only, one, of, three, values, 0, corresponding, to, flat, euclidean, geometry, 1, corresponding, to, a, space, of, positive, curvature, or, 1, corresponding, to, a, space, of, positive, or, negative, curvature, the, value, of, r, as, a, function, of, time, t, depends, upon, k, and, the, cosmological, constant, the, cosmological, constant, represents, the, energy, density, of, the, vacuum, of, space, and, could, be, related, to, dark, energy, the, equation, describing, how, r, varies, with, time, is, known, as, the, friedmann, equation, after, its, inventor, alexander, friedmann, the, solutions, for, r, t, depend, on, k, and, but, some, qualitative, features, of, such, solutions, are, general, first, and, most, importantly, the, length, scale, r, of, the, universe, can, remain, constant, only, if, the, universe, is, perfectly, isotropic, with, positive, curvature, k, 1, and, has, one, precise, value, of, density, everywhere, as, first, noted, by, albert, einstein, second, all, solutions, suggest, that, there, was, a, gravitational, singularity, in, the, past, when, r, went, to, zero, and, matter, and, energy, were, infinitely, dense, it, may, seem, that, this, conclusion, is, uncertain, because, it, is, based, on, the, questionable, assumptions, of, perfect, homogeneity, and, isotropy, the, cosmological, principle, and, that, only, the, gravitational, interaction, is, significant, however, the, penrose, hawking, singularity, theorems, show, that, a, singularity, should, exist, for, very, general, conditions, hence, according, to, einstein, s, field, equations, r, grew, rapidly, from, an, unimaginably, hot, dense, state, that, existed, immediately, following, this, singularity, when, r, had, a, small, finite, value, this, is, the, essence, of, the, big, bang, model, of, the, universe, understanding, the, singularity, of, the, big, bang, likely, requires, a, quantum, theory, of, gravity, which, has, not, yet, been, formulated, third, the, curvature, index, k, determines, the, sign, of, the, curvature, of, constant, time, spatial, surfaces, averaged, over, sufficiently, large, length, scales, greater, than, about, a, billion, light, years, if, k, 1, the, curvature, is, positive, and, the, universe, has, a, finite, volume, a, universe, with, positive, curvature, is, often, visualized, as, a, three, dimensional, sphere, embedded, in, a, four, dimensional, space, conversely, if, k, is, zero, or, negative, the, universe, has, an, infinite, volume, it, may, seem, counter, intuitive, that, an, infinite, and, yet, infinitely, dense, universe, could, be, created, in, a, single, instant, when, r, 0, but, exactly, that, is, predicted, mathematically, when, k, is, nonpositive, and, the, cosmological, principle, is, satisfied, by, analogy, an, infinite, plane, has, zero, curvature, but, infinite, area, whereas, an, infinite, cylinder, is, finite, in, one, direction, and, a, torus, is, finite, in, both, the, ultimate, fate, of, the, universe, is, still, unknown, because, it, depends, critically, on, the, curvature, index, k, and, the, cosmological, constant, if, the, universe, were, sufficiently, dense, k, would, equal, 1, meaning, that, its, average, curvature, throughout, is, positive, and, the, universe, will, eventually, recollapse, in, a, big, crunch, possibly, starting, a, new, universe, in, a, big, bounce, conversely, if, the, universe, were, insufficiently, dense, k, would, equal, 0, or, 1, and, the, universe, would, expand, forever, cooling, off, and, eventually, reaching, the, big, freeze, and, the, heat, death, of, the, universe, modern, data, suggests, that, the, expansion, of, the, universe, is, accelerating, if, this, acceleration, is, sufficiently, rapid, the, universe, may, eventually, reach, a, big, rip, observationally, the, universe, appears, to, be, flat, k, 0, with, an, overall, density, that, is, very, close, to, the, critical, value, between, recollapse, and, eternal, expansion, some, speculative, theories, have, proposed, that, our, universe, is, but, one, of, a, set, of, disconnected, universes, collectively, denoted, as, the, multiverse, challenging, or, enhancing, more, limited, definitions, of, the, universe, max, tegmark, developed, a, four, part, classification, scheme, for, the, different, types, of, multiverses, that, scientists, have, suggested, in, response, to, various, problems, in, physics, an, example, of, such, multiverses, is, the, one, resulting, from, the, chaotic, inflation, model, of, the, early, universe, another, is, the, multiverse, resulting, from, the, many, worlds, interpretation, of, quantum, mechanics, in, this, interpretation, parallel, worlds, are, generated, in, a, manner, similar, to, quantum, superposition, and, decoherence, with, all, states, of, the, wave, functions, being, realized, in, separate, worlds, effectively, in, the, many, worlds, interpretation, the, multiverse, evolves, as, a, universal, wavefunction, if, the, big, bang, that, created, our, multiverse, created, an, ensemble, of, multiverses, the, wave, function, of, the, ensemble, would, be, entangled, in, this, sense, whether, scientifically, meaningful, probabilities, can, be, extracted, from, this, picture, has, been, and, continues, to, be, a, topic, of, much, debate, and, multiple, versions, of, the, many, worlds, interpretation, exist, the, subject, of, the, interpretation, of, quantum, mechanics, is, in, general, marked, by, disagreement, the, least, controversial, but, still, highly, disputed, category, of, multiverse, in, tegmark, s, scheme, is, level, i, the, multiverses, of, this, level, are, composed, by, distant, spacetime, events, in, our, own, universe, tegmark, and, others, have, argued, that, if, space, is, infinite, or, sufficiently, large, and, uniform, identical, instances, of, the, history, of, earth, s, entire, hubble, volume, occur, every, so, often, simply, by, chance, tegmark, calculated, that, our, nearest, so, called, doppelg, nger, is, 10, 10, 115, metres, away, from, us, a, double, exponential, function, larger, than, a, googolplex, however, the, arguments, used, are, of, speculative, nature, it, is, possible, to, conceive, of, disconnected, spacetimes, each, existing, but, unable, to, interact, with, one, another, an, easily, visualized, metaphor, of, this, concept, is, a, group, of, separate, soap, bubbles, in, which, observers, living, on, one, soap, bubble, cannot, interact, with, those, on, other, soap, bubbles, even, in, principle, according, to, one, common, terminology, each, soap, bubble, of, spacetime, is, denoted, as, a, universe, whereas, humans, particular, spacetime, is, denoted, as, the, universe, just, as, humans, call, earth, s, moon, the, moon, the, entire, collection, of, these, separate, spacetimes, is, denoted, as, the, multiverse, with, this, terminology, different, universes, are, not, causally, connected, to, each, other, in, principle, the, other, unconnected, universes, may, have, different, dimensionalities, and, topologies, of, spacetime, different, forms, of, matter, and, energy, and, different, physical, laws, and, physical, constants, although, such, possibilities, are, purely, speculative, others, consider, each, of, several, bubbles, created, as, part, of, chaotic, inflation, to, be, separate, universes, though, in, this, model, these, universes, all, share, a, causal, origin, historically, there, have, been, many, ideas, of, the, cosmos, cosmologies, and, its, origin, cosmogonies, theories, of, an, impersonal, universe, governed, by, physical, laws, were, first, proposed, by, the, greeks, and, indians, ancient, chinese, philosophy, encompassed, the, notion, of, the, universe, including, both, all, of, space, and, all, of, time, over, the, centuries, improvements, in, astronomical, observations, and, theories, of, motion, and, gravitation, led, to, ever, more, accurate, descriptions, of, the, universe, the, modern, era, of, cosmology, began, with, albert, einstein, s, 1915, general, theory, of, relativity, which, made, it, possible, to, quantitatively, predict, the, origin, evolution, and, conclusion, of, the, universe, as, a, whole, most, modern, accepted, theories, of, cosmology, are, based, on, general, relativity, and, more, specifically, the, predicted, big, bang, many, cultures, have, stories, describing, the, origin, of, the, world, and, universe, cultures, generally, regard, these, stories, as, having, some, truth, there, are, however, many, differing, beliefs, in, how, these, stories, apply, amongst, those, believing, in, a, supernatural, origin, ranging, from, a, god, directly, creating, the, universe, as, it, is, now, to, a, god, just, setting, the, wheels, in, motion, for, example, via, mechanisms, such, as, the, big, bang, and, evolution, ethnologists, and, anthropologists, who, study, myths, have, developed, various, classification, schemes, for, the, various, themes, that, appear, in, creation, stories, for, example, in, one, type, of, story, the, world, is, born, from, a, world, egg, such, stories, include, the, finnish, epic, poem, kalevala, the, chinese, story, of, pangu, or, the, indian, brahmanda, purana, in, related, stories, the, universe, is, created, by, a, single, entity, emanating, or, producing, something, by, him, or, herself, as, in, the, tibetan, buddhism, concept, of, adi, buddha, the, ancient, greek, story, of, gaia, mother, earth, the, aztec, goddess, coatlicue, myth, the, ancient, egyptian, god, atum, story, and, the, judeo, christian, genesis, creation, narrative, in, which, the, abrahamic, god, created, the, universe, in, another, type, of, story, the, universe, is, created, from, the, union, of, male, and, female, deities, as, in, the, maori, story, of, rangi, and, papa, in, other, stories, the, universe, is, created, by, crafting, it, from, pre, existing, materials, such, as, the, corpse, of, a, dead, god, as, from, tiamat, in, the, babylonian, epic, enuma, elish, or, from, the, giant, ymir, in, norse, mythology, or, from, chaotic, materials, as, in, izanagi, and, izanami, in, japanese, mythology, in, other, stories, the, universe, emanates, from, fundamental, principles, such, as, brahman, and, prakrti, and, the, creation, myth, of, the, serers, the, pre, socratic, greek, philosophers, and, indian, philosophers, developed, some, of, the, earliest, philosophical, concepts, of, the, universe, the, earliest, greek, philosophers, noted, that, appearances, can, be, deceiving, and, sought, to, understand, the, underlying, reality, behind, the, appearances, in, particular, they, noted, the, ability, of, matter, to, change, forms, e, g, ice, to, water, to, steam, and, several, philosophers, proposed, that, all, the, physical, materials, in, the, world, are, different, forms, of, a, single, primordial, material, or, arche, the, first, to, do, so, was, thales, who, proposed, this, material, to, be, water, thales, student, anaximander, proposed, that, everything, came, from, the, limitless, apeiron, anaximenes, proposed, the, primordial, material, to, be, air, on, account, of, its, perceived, attractive, and, repulsive, qualities, that, cause, the, arche, to, condense, or, dissociate, into, different, forms, anaxagoras, proposed, the, principle, of, nous, mind, while, heraclitus, proposed, fire, and, spoke, of, logos, empedocles, proposed, the, elements, to, be, earth, water, air, and, fire, his, four, element, model, became, very, popular, like, pythagoras, plato, believed, that, all, things, were, composed, of, number, with, empedocles, elements, taking, the, form, of, the, platonic, solids, democritus, and, later, philosophers, most, notably, leucippus, proposed, that, the, universe, is, composed, of, indivisible, atoms, moving, through, a, void, vacuum, although, aristotle, did, not, believe, that, to, be, feasible, because, air, like, water, offers, resistance, to, motion, air, will, immediately, rush, in, to, fill, a, void, and, moreover, without, resistance, it, would, do, so, indefinitely, fast, although, heraclitus, argued, for, eternal, change, his, contemporary, parmenides, emphasized, changelessness, parmenides, poem, on, nature, has, been, read, as, saying, that, all, change, is, an, illusion, that, the, true, underlying, reality, is, eternally, unchanging, and, of, a, single, nature, or, at, least, that, the, essential, feature, of, each, thing, that, exists, must, exist, eternally, without, origin, change, or, end, his, student, zeno, of, elea, challenged, everyday, ideas, about, motion, with, several, famous, paradoxes, aristotle, responded, to, these, paradoxes, by, developing, the, notion, of, a, potential, countable, infinity, as, well, as, the, infinitely, divisible, continuum, the, indian, philosopher, kanada, founder, of, the, vaisheshika, school, developed, a, notion, of, atomism, and, proposed, that, light, and, heat, were, varieties, of, the, same, substance, in, the, 5th, century, ad, the, buddhist, atomist, philosopher, dign, ga, proposed, atoms, to, be, point, sized, durationless, and, made, of, energy, they, denied, the, existence, of, substantial, matter, and, proposed, that, movement, consisted, of, momentary, flashes, of, a, stream, of, energy, the, notion, of, temporal, finitism, was, inspired, by, the, doctrine, of, creation, shared, by, the, three, abrahamic, religions, judaism, christianity, and, islam, the, christian, philosopher, john, philoponus, presented, the, philosophical, arguments, against, the, ancient, greek, notion, of, an, infinite, past, and, future, philoponus, arguments, against, an, infinite, past, were, used, by, the, early, muslim, philosopher, al, kindi, alkindus, the, jewish, philosopher, saadia, gaon, saadia, ben, joseph, and, the, muslim, theologian, al, ghazali, algazel, pantheism, is, the, philosophical, religious, belief, that, the, universe, itself, is, identical, to, divinity, and, a, supreme, being, or, entity, the, physical, universe, is, thus, understood, as, an, all, encompassing, immanent, deity, the, term, pantheist, designates, one, who, holds, both, that, everything, constitutes, a, unity, and, that, this, unity, is, divine, consisting, of, an, all, encompassing, manifested, god, or, goddess, the, earliest, written, records, of, identifiable, predecessors, to, modern, astronomy, come, from, ancient, egypt, and, mesopotamia, from, around, 3000, to, 1200, bce, babylonian, astronomers, of, the, 7th, century, bce, viewed, the, world, as, a, flat, disk, surrounded, by, the, ocean, later, greek, philosophers, observing, the, motions, of, the, heavenly, bodies, were, concerned, with, developing, models, of, the, universe, based, more, profoundly, on, empirical, evidence, the, first, coherent, model, was, proposed, by, eudoxus, of, cnidos, a, student, of, plato, who, followed, plato, s, idea, that, heavenly, motions, had, to, be, circular, in, order, to, account, for, the, known, complications, of, the, planets, motions, particularly, retrograde, movement, eudoxus, model, included, 27, different, celestial, spheres, four, for, each, of, the, planets, visible, to, the, naked, eye, three, each, for, the, sun, and, the, moon, and, one, for, the, stars, all, of, these, spheres, were, centered, on, the, earth, which, remained, motionless, while, they, rotated, eternally, aristotle, elaborated, upon, this, model, increasing, the, number, of, spheres, to, 55, in, order, to, account, for, further, details, of, planetary, motion, for, aristotle, normal, matter, was, entirely, contained, within, the, terrestrial, sphere, and, it, obeyed, fundamentally, different, rules, from, heavenly, material, the, post, aristotle, treatise, de, mundo, of, uncertain, authorship, and, date, stated, five, elements, situated, in, spheres, in, five, regions, the, less, being, in, each, case, surrounded, by, the, greater, namely, earth, surrounded, by, water, water, by, air, air, by, fire, and, fire, by, ether, make, up, the, whole, universe, this, model, was, also, refined, by, callippus, and, after, concentric, spheres, were, abandoned, it, was, brought, into, nearly, perfect, agreement, with, astronomical, observations, by, ptolemy, the, success, of, such, a, model, is, largely, due, to, the, mathematical, fact, that, any, function, such, as, the, position, of, a, planet, can, be, decomposed, into, a, set, of, circular, functions, the, fourier, modes, other, greek, scientists, such, as, the, pythagorean, philosopher, philolaus, postulated, according, to, stobaeus, account, that, at, the, center, of, the, universe, was, a, central, fire, around, which, the, earth, sun, moon, and, planets, revolved, in, uniform, circular, motion, the, greek, astronomer, aristarchus, of, samos, was, the, first, known, individual, to, propose, a, heliocentric, model, of, the, universe, though, the, original, text, has, been, lost, a, reference, in, archimedes, book, the, sand, reckoner, describes, aristarchus, s, heliocentric, model, archimedes, wrote, you, king, gelon, are, aware, the, universe, is, the, name, given, by, most, astronomers, to, the, sphere, the, center, of, which, is, the, center, of, the, earth, while, its, radius, is, equal, to, the, straight, line, between, the, center, of, the, sun, and, the, center, of, the, earth, this, is, the, common, account, as, you, have, heard, from, astronomers, but, aristarchus, has, brought, out, a, book, consisting, of, certain, hypotheses, wherein, it, appears, as, a, consequence, of, the, assumptions, made, that, the, universe, is, many, times, greater, than, the, universe, just, mentioned, his, hypotheses, are, that, the, fixed, stars, and, the, sun, remain, unmoved, that, the, earth, revolves, about, the, sun, on, the, circumference, of, a, circle, the, sun, lying, in, the, middle, of, the, orbit, and, that, the, sphere, of, fixed, stars, situated, about, the, same, center, as, the, sun, is, so, great, that, the, circle, in, which, he, supposes, the, earth, to, revolve, bears, such, a, proportion, to, the, distance, of, the, fixed, stars, as, the, center, of, the, sphere, bears, to, its, surface, aristarchus, thus, believed, the, stars, to, be, very, far, away, and, saw, this, as, the, reason, why, stellar, parallax, had, not, been, observed, that, is, the, stars, had, not, been, observed, to, move, relative, each, other, as, the, earth, moved, around, the, sun, the, stars, are, in, fact, much, farther, away, than, the, distance, that, was, generally, assumed, in, ancient, times, which, is, why, stellar, parallax, is, only, detectable, with, precision, instruments, the, geocentric, model, consistent, with, planetary, parallax, was, assumed, to, be, the, explanation, for, the, unobservability, of, stellar, parallax, the, only, other, astronomer, from, antiquity, known, by, name, who, supported, aristarchus, s, heliocentric, model, was, seleucus, of, seleucia, a, hellenistic, astronomer, who, lived, a, century, after, aristarchus, according, to, plutarch, seleucus, was, the, first, to, prove, the, heliocentric, system, through, reasoning, but, it, is, not, known, what, arguments, he, used, seleucus, arguments, for, a, heliocentric, cosmology, were, probably, related, to, the, phenomenon, of, tides, according, to, strabo, 1, 1, 9, seleucus, was, the, first, to, state, that, the, tides, are, due, to, the, attraction, of, the, moon, and, that, the, height, of, the, tides, depends, on, the, moon, s, position, relative, to, the, sun, alternatively, he, may, have, proved, heliocentricity, by, determining, the, constants, of, a, geometric, model, for, it, and, by, developing, methods, to, compute, planetary, positions, using, this, model, similar, to, nicolaus, copernicus, in, the, 16th, century, during, the, middle, ages, heliocentric, models, were, also, proposed, by, the, persian, astronomers, albumasar, and, al, sijzi, the, aristotelian, model, was, accepted, in, the, western, world, for, roughly, two, millennia, until, copernicus, revived, aristarchus, s, perspective, that, the, astronomical, data, could, be, explained, more, plausibly, if, the, earth, rotated, on, its, axis, and, if, the, sun, were, placed, at, the, center, of, the, universe, in, the, center, rests, the, sun, for, who, would, place, this, lamp, of, a, very, beautiful, temple, in, another, or, better, place, than, this, wherefrom, it, can, illuminate, everything, at, the, same, time, as, noted, by, copernicus, the, notion, that, the, earth, rotates, is, very, old, dating, at, least, to, philolaus, c, 450, bc, heraclides, ponticus, c, 350, bc, and, ecphantus, the, pythagorean, roughly, a, century, before, copernicus, the, christian, scholar, nicholas, of, cusa, also, proposed, that, the, earth, rotates, on, its, axis, in, his, book, on, learned, ignorance, 1440, al, sijzi, also, proposed, that, the, earth, rotates, on, its, axis, empirical, evidence, for, the, earth, s, rotation, on, its, axis, using, the, phenomenon, of, comets, was, given, by, tusi, 1201, 1274, and, ali, qushji, 1403, 1474, this, cosmology, was, accepted, by, isaac, newton, christiaan, huygens, and, later, scientists, newton, demonstrated, that, the, same, laws, of, motion, and, gravity, apply, to, earthly, and, to, celestial, matter, making, aristotle, s, division, between, the, two, obsolete, edmund, halley, 1720, and, jean, philippe, de, ch, seaux, 1744, noted, independently, that, the, assumption, of, an, infinite, space, filled, uniformly, with, stars, would, lead, to, the, prediction, that, the, nighttime, sky, would, be, as, bright, as, the, sun, itself, this, became, known, as, olbers, paradox, in, the, 19th, century, newton, believed, that, an, infinite, space, uniformly, filled, with, matter, would, cause, infinite, forces, and, instabilities, causing, the, matter, to, be, crushed, inwards, under, its, own, gravity, this, instability, was, clarified, in, 1902, by, the, jeans, instability, criterion, one, solution, to, these, paradoxes, is, the, charlier, universe, in, which, the, matter, is, arranged, hierarchically, systems, of, orbiting, bodies, that, are, themselves, orbiting, in, a, larger, system, ad, infinitum, in, a, fractal, way, such, that, the, universe, has, a, negligibly, small, overall, density, such, a, cosmological, model, had, also, been, proposed, earlier, in, 1761, by, johann, heinrich, lambert, during, the, 18th, century, immanuel, kant, speculated, that, nebulae, could, be, entire, galaxies, separate, from, the, milky, way, and, in, 1850, alexander, von, humboldt, called, these, separate, galaxies, weltinseln, or, world, islands, a, term, that, later, developed, into, island, universes, in, 1919, when, the, hooker, telescope, was, completed, the, prevailing, view, was, that, the, universe, consisted, entirely, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, using, the, hooker, telescope, edwin, hubble, identified, cepheid, variables, in, several, spiral, nebulae, and, in, 1922, 1923, proved, conclusively, that, andromeda, nebula, and, triangulum, among, others, were, entire, galaxies, outside, our, own, thus, proving, that, the, universe, consists, of, a, multitude, of, galaxies, the, modern, era, of, physical, cosmology, began, in, 1917, when, albert, einstein, first, applied, his, general, theory, of, relativity, to, model, the, structure, and, dynamics, of, the, universe, the, discoveries, of, this, era, and, the, questions, that, remain, unanswered, are, outlined, in, the, sections, above, footnotes, citations, two, systems, of, hindu, thought, propound, physical, theories, suggestively, similar, to, those, of, greece, kanada, founder, of, the, vaisheshika, philosophy, held, that, the, world, is, composed, of, atoms, as, many, in, kind, as, the, various, elements, the, jains, more, nearly, approximated, to, democritus, by, teaching, that, all, atoms, were, of, the, same, kind, producing, different, effects, by, diverse, modes, of, combinations, kanada, believed, light, and, heat, to, be, varieties, of, the, same, substance, udayana, taught, that, all, heat, comes, from, the, sun, and, vachaspati, like, newton, interpreted, light, as, composed, of, minute, particles, emitted, by, substances, and, striking, the, eye, the, buddhists, denied, the, existence, of, substantial, matter, altogether, movement, consists, for, them, of, moments, it, is, a, staccato, movement, momentary, flashes, of, a, stream, of, energy, everything, is, evanescent, says, the, buddhist, because, there, is, no, stuff, both, systems, share, in, common, a, tendency, to, push, the, analysis, of, existence, up, to, its, minutest, last, elements, which, are, imagined, as, absolute, qualities, or, things, possessing, only, one, unique, quality, they, are, called, qualities, guna, dharma, in, both, systems, in, the, sense, of, absolute, qualities, a, kind, of, atomic, or, intra, atomic, energies, of, which, the, empirical, things, are, composed, both, systems, therefore, agree, in, denying, the, objective, reality, of, the, categories, of, substance, and, quality, and, of, the, relation, of, inference, uniting, them, there, is, in, s, nkhya, philosophy, no, separate, existence, of, qualities, what, we, call, quality, is, but, a, particular, manifestation, of, a, subtle, entity, to, every, new, unit, of, quality, corresponds, a, subtle, quantum, of, matter, which, is, called, guna, quality, but, represents, a, subtle, substantive, entity, the, same, applies, to, early, buddhism, where, all, qualities, are, substantive, or, more, precisely, dynamic, entities, although, they, are, also, called, dharmas, qualities
