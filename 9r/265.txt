wolf, rayet, stars, often, abbreviated, as, wr, stars, are, a, rare, heterogeneous, set, of, stars, with, unusual, spectra, showing, prominent, broad, emission, lines, of, ionised, helium, and, highly, ionised, nitrogen, or, carbon, the, spectra, indicate, very, high, surface, enhancement, of, heavy, elements, depletion, of, hydrogen, and, strong, stellar, winds, the, surface, temperatures, of, known, wolf, rayet, stars, range, from, 20, 000, k, to, around, 210, 000, k, hotter, than, almost, all, other, kinds, of, stars, they, were, previously, called, w, type, stars, referring, to, their, spectral, classification, classic, or, population, i, wolf, rayet, stars, are, evolved, massive, stars, that, have, completely, lost, their, outer, hydrogen, and, are, fusing, helium, or, heavier, elements, in, the, core, a, subset, of, the, population, i, wr, stars, show, hydrogen, lines, in, their, spectra, and, are, known, as, wnh, stars, they, are, young, extremely, massive, stars, still, fusing, hydrogen, at, the, core, with, helium, and, nitrogen, exposed, at, the, surface, by, strong, mixing, and, radiation, driven, mass, loss, a, separate, group, of, stars, with, wr, spectra, are, the, central, stars, of, planetary, nebulae, cspne, post, asymptotic, giant, branch, stars, that, were, similar, to, the, sun, while, on, the, main, sequence, but, have, now, ceased, fusion, and, shed, their, atmospheres, to, reveal, a, bare, carbon, oxygen, core, all, wolf, rayet, stars, are, highly, luminous, objects, due, to, their, high, temperatures, thousands, of, times, the, bolometric, luminosity, of, the, sun, l, for, the, cspne, hundreds, of, thousands, l, for, the, population, i, wr, stars, to, over, a, million, l, for, the, wnh, stars, although, not, exceptionally, bright, visually, since, most, of, their, radiation, output, is, in, the, ultraviolet, the, naked, eye, star, systems, velorum, and, muscae, both, contain, wolf, rayet, stars, and, one, of, the, most, massive, known, stars, r136a1, in, 30, doradus, is, also, a, wolf, rayet, star, in, 1867, using, the, 40, cm, foucault, telescope, at, the, paris, observatory, astronomers, charles, wolf, and, georges, rayet, discovered, three, stars, in, the, constellation, cygnus, hd, 191765, hd, 192103, and, hd, 192641, now, designated, as, wr, 134, wr, 135, and, wr, 137, respectively, that, displayed, broad, emission, bands, on, an, otherwise, continuous, spectrum, most, stars, only, display, absorption, lines, or, bands, in, their, spectra, as, a, result, of, overlying, elements, absorbing, light, energy, at, specific, frequencies, so, these, were, clearly, unusual, objects, the, nature, of, the, emission, bands, in, the, spectra, of, a, wolf, rayet, star, remained, a, mystery, for, several, decades, e, c, pickering, theorized, that, the, lines, were, caused, by, an, unusual, state, of, hydrogen, and, it, was, found, that, this, pickering, series, of, lines, followed, a, pattern, similar, to, the, balmer, series, when, half, integer, quantum, numbers, were, substituted, it, was, later, shown, that, these, lines, resulted, from, the, presence, of, helium, the, chemical, element, having, just, been, discovered, in, 1868, pickering, noted, similarities, between, wolf, rayet, spectra, and, nebular, spectra, and, this, similarity, led, to, the, conclusion, that, some, or, all, wolf, rayet, stars, were, the, central, stars, of, planetary, nebulae, by, 1929, the, width, of, the, emission, bands, was, being, attributed, to, doppler, broadening, and, hence, the, gas, surrounding, these, stars, must, be, moving, with, velocities, of, 300, 2400, km, s, along, the, line, of, sight, the, conclusion, was, that, a, wolf, rayet, star, is, continually, ejecting, gas, into, space, producing, an, expanding, envelope, of, nebulous, gas, the, force, ejecting, the, gas, at, the, high, velocities, observed, is, radiation, pressure, it, was, well, known, that, many, stars, with, wolf, rayet, type, spectra, were, the, central, stars, of, planetary, nebulae, but, also, that, many, were, not, associated, with, an, obvious, planetary, nebula, or, any, visible, nebulosity, at, all, in, addition, to, helium, carlyle, smith, beals, identified, emission, lines, of, carbon, oxygen, and, nitrogen, in, the, spectra, of, wolf, rayet, stars, in, 1938, the, international, astronomical, union, classified, the, spectra, of, wolf, rayet, stars, into, types, wn, and, wc, depending, on, whether, the, spectrum, was, dominated, by, lines, of, nitrogen, or, carbon, oxygen, respectively, in, 1969, several, cspne, with, strong, oxygen, vi, o, vi, emissions, lines, were, grouped, under, a, new, o, vi, sequence, or, just, ovi, type, similar, stars, not, associated, with, planetary, nebulae, were, described, shortly, after, and, the, wo, classification, was, adopted, for, them, the, ovi, stars, were, subsequently, classified, as, stars, consistent, with, the, population, i, wr, stars, the, understanding, that, certain, late, and, sometimes, not, so, late, wn, stars, with, hydrogen, lines, in, their, spectra, are, at, a, different, stage, of, evolution, from, hydrogen, free, wr, stars, has, led, to, the, introduction, of, the, term, wnh, to, distinguish, these, stars, generally, from, other, wn, stars, they, were, previously, referred, to, as, wnl, stars, although, there, are, late, type, wn, stars, without, hydrogen, as, well, as, wr, stars, with, hydrogen, as, early, as, wn5, wolf, rayet, stars, were, named, on, the, basis, of, the, strong, broad, emission, lines, in, their, spectra, identified, with, helium, nitrogen, carbon, silicon, and, oxygen, but, with, hydrogen, lines, usually, weak, or, absent, initially, simply, referred, to, as, class, w, or, w, type, stars, the, classification, was, then, split, into, stars, with, dominant, lines, of, ionised, nitrogen, n, iii, n, iv, and, n, v, and, those, with, dominant, lines, of, ionised, carbon, c, iii, and, c, iv, and, sometimes, oxygen, o, iii, o, vi, referred, to, as, wn, and, wc, respectively, the, two, classes, wn, and, wc, were, further, split, into, temperature, sequences, wn5, wn8, and, wc6, wc8, based, on, the, relative, strengths, of, the, 541, 1, nm, he, ii, and, 587, 5, nm, he, i, lines, wolf, rayet, emission, lines, frequently, have, a, broadened, absorption, wing, p, cygni, profile, suggesting, circumstellar, material, a, wo, sequence, has, also, been, separated, from, the, wc, sequence, for, even, hotter, stars, where, emission, of, ionised, oxygen, dominates, that, of, ionised, carbon, although, the, actual, proportions, of, those, elements, in, the, stars, are, likely, to, be, comparable, wc, and, wo, spectra, are, formally, distinguished, based, on, the, presence, or, absence, of, c, iii, emission, wc, spectra, also, generally, lack, the, o, vi, lines, that, are, strong, in, wo, spectra, the, wn, spectral, sequence, was, expanded, to, include, wn2, wn9, and, the, definitions, refined, based, on, the, relative, strengths, of, the, n, iii, lines, at, 463, 4, 464, 1, nm, and, 531, 4, nm, the, n, iv, lines, at, 347, 9, 348, 4, nm, and, 405, 8, nm, and, the, n, v, lines, at, 460, 3, nm, 461, 9, nm, and, 493, 3, 494, 4, nm, these, lines, are, well, separated, from, areas, of, strong, and, variable, he, emission, and, the, line, strengths, are, well, correlated, with, temperature, stars, with, spectra, intermediate, between, wn, and, ofpe, have, been, classified, as, wn10, and, wn11, although, this, nomenclature, is, not, universally, accepted, the, type, wn1, was, proposed, for, stars, with, neither, n, iv, nor, n, v, lines, to, accommodate, brey, 1, and, brey, 66, which, appeared, to, be, intermediate, between, wn2, and, wn2, 5, the, relative, line, strengths, and, widths, for, each, wn, sub, class, were, later, quantified, and, the, ratio, between, the, 541, 1, nm, he, ii, and, 587, 5, nm, he, i, lines, was, introduced, as, the, primary, indicator, of, the, ionisation, level, and, hence, of, the, spectral, sub, class, the, need, for, wn1, disappeared, and, both, brey, 1, and, brey, 66, are, now, classified, as, wn3b, the, somewhat, obscure, wn2, 5, and, wn4, 5, classes, were, dropped, the, wc, spectral, sequence, was, expanded, to, include, wc4, wc11, although, some, older, papers, have, also, used, wc1, wc3, the, primary, emission, lines, used, to, distinguish, the, wc, sub, types, are, c, ii, 426, 7, nm, c, iii, at, 569, 6, nm, c, iii, iv, 465, 0, nm, c, iv, at, 580, 1, 581, 2, nm, and, the, o, v, and, o, iii, blend, at, 557, 2, 559, 8, nm, the, sequence, was, extended, to, include, wc10, and, wc11, and, the, subclass, criteria, were, quantified, based, primarily, on, the, relative, strengths, of, carbon, lines, to, rely, on, ionisation, factors, even, if, there, were, abundance, variations, between, carbon, and, oxygen, for, wo, type, stars, the, main, lines, used, are, c, iv, at, 580, 1, nm, o, iv, at, 340, 0, nm, o, v, and, o, iii, blend, at, 557, 2, 559, 8, nm, o, vi, at, 381, 1, 383, 4, nm, o, vii, at, 567, 0, nm, and, o, viii, at, 606, 8, nm, the, sequence, was, expanded, to, include, wo5, and, quantified, based, the, relative, strengths, of, the, o, vi, c, iv, and, o, vi, o, v, lines, a, later, scheme, designed, for, consistency, across, classical, wr, stars, and, cspne, returned, to, the, wo1, to, wo4, sequence, and, adjusted, the, divisions, detailed, modern, studies, of, wolf, rayet, stars, can, identify, additional, spectral, features, indicated, by, suffixes, to, the, main, spectral, classification, the, classification, of, wolf, rayet, spectra, is, complicated, by, the, frequent, association, of, the, stars, with, dense, nebulosity, dust, clouds, or, binary, companions, a, suffix, of, ob, is, used, to, indicate, the, presence, of, absorption, lines, in, the, spectrum, likely, to, be, associated, with, a, more, normal, companion, star, or, abs, for, absorption, lines, with, an, unknown, origin, the, hotter, wr, spectral, sub, classes, are, described, as, early, and, the, cooler, ones, as, late, consistent, with, other, spectral, types, wne, and, wce, refer, to, early, type, spectra, while, wnl, and, wcl, refer, to, late, type, spectra, with, the, dividing, line, approximately, at, sub, class, six, or, seven, there, is, no, such, thing, as, a, late, wo, type, star, there, is, a, strong, tendency, for, wne, stars, to, be, hydrogen, poor, while, the, spectra, of, wnl, stars, frequently, include, hydrogen, lines, spectral, types, for, the, central, stars, of, planetary, nebulae, are, qualified, by, surrounding, them, with, square, brackets, e, g, they, are, almost, all, of, the, wc, sequence, with, the, known, stars, representing, the, hot, extension, of, the, carbon, sequence, there, are, also, a, small, number, of, and, types, only, discovered, quite, recently, their, formation, mechanism, is, as, yet, unclear, temperatures, of, the, planetary, nebula, central, stars, tend, to, the, extremes, when, compared, to, population, i, wr, stars, so, and, are, common, and, the, sequence, has, been, extended, to, the, and, types, have, distinctive, spectra, with, narrow, emission, lines, and, no, he, ii, and, c, iv, lines, certain, supernovae, observed, before, their, peak, brightness, show, wr, spectra, this, is, due, to, the, nature, of, the, supernova, at, this, point, a, rapidly, expanding, helium, rich, ejecta, similar, to, an, extreme, wolf, rayet, wind, the, wr, spectral, features, only, last, a, matter, of, hours, the, high, ionisation, features, fading, by, maximum, to, leave, only, weak, neutral, hydrogen, and, helium, emission, before, being, replaced, with, a, traditional, supernova, spectrum, it, has, been, proposed, to, label, these, spectral, types, with, an, x, for, example, xwn5, h, similarly, classical, novae, develop, spectra, consisting, of, broad, emission, bands, similar, to, a, wolf, rayet, star, this, is, caused, by, the, same, physical, mechanism, rapid, expansion, of, dense, gases, around, an, extremely, hot, central, source, the, separation, of, wolf, rayet, stars, from, spectral, class, o, stars, of, a, similar, temperature, depends, on, the, existence, of, strong, emission, lines, of, ionised, helium, nitrogen, carbon, and, oxygen, but, there, are, a, number, of, stars, with, intermediate, or, confusing, spectral, features, for, example, high, luminosity, o, stars, can, develop, helium, and, nitrogen, in, their, spectra, with, some, emission, lines, while, some, wr, stars, have, hydrogen, lines, weak, emission, and, even, absorption, components, these, stars, have, been, given, spectral, types, such, as, o3if, wn6, and, are, referred, to, as, slash, stars, class, o, supergiants, can, develop, emission, lines, of, helium, and, nitrogen, or, emission, components, to, some, absorption, lines, these, are, indicated, by, spectral, peculiarity, suffix, codes, specific, to, this, type, of, star, these, codes, may, also, be, combined, with, more, general, spectral, type, qualifiers, such, as, p, or, a, common, combinations, include, oiafpe, and, oif, and, ofpe, in, the, 1970s, it, was, recognised, that, there, was, a, continuum, of, spectra, from, pure, absorption, class, o, to, unambiguous, wr, types, and, it, was, unclear, whether, some, intermediate, stars, should, be, given, a, spectral, type, such, as, o8iafpe, or, wn8, a, the, slash, notation, was, proposed, to, deal, with, these, situations, and, the, star, sk, 67, 22, was, assigned, the, spectral, type, o3if, wn6, a, the, criteria, for, distinguishing, oif, oif, wn, and, wn, stars, have, been, refined, for, consistency, slash, star, classifications, are, used, when, the, h, line, has, a, p, cygni, profile, this, is, an, absorption, line, in, o, supergiants, and, an, emission, line, in, wn, stars, criteria, for, the, following, slash, star, spectral, types, are, given, using, the, nitrogen, emission, lines, at, 463, 4, 464, 1, nm, 405, 8, nm, and, 460, 3, 462, 0, nm, together, with, a, standard, star, for, each, type, another, set, of, slash, star, spectral, types, is, in, use, for, ofpe, wn, stars, these, stars, have, o, supergiant, spectra, plus, nitrogen, and, helium, emission, and, p, cygni, profiles, alternatively, they, can, be, considered, to, be, wn, stars, with, unusually, low, ionisation, levels, and, hydrogen, the, slash, notation, for, these, stars, was, controversial, and, an, alternative, was, to, extend, the, wr, nitrogen, sequence, to, wn10, and, wn11, other, authors, preferred, to, use, the, wnha, notation, for, example, wn9ha, for, wr, 108, a, recent, recommendation, is, to, use, an, o, spectral, type, such, as, o8iaf, if, the, 447, 1, nm, he, i, line, is, in, absorption, and, a, wr, class, of, wn9h, or, wn9ha, if, the, line, has, a, p, cygni, profile, however, the, ofpe, wn, slash, notation, as, well, as, wn10, and, wn11, classifications, continue, to, be, widely, used, a, third, group, of, stars, with, spectra, containing, features, of, both, o, class, stars, and, wr, stars, has, been, identified, nine, stars, in, the, large, magellanic, cloud, have, spectra, that, contain, both, wn3, and, o3v, features, but, do, not, appear, to, be, binaries, many, of, the, wr, stars, in, the, small, magellanic, cloud, also, have, very, early, wn, spectra, plus, high, excitation, absorption, features, it, has, been, suggested, that, these, could, be, a, missing, link, leading, to, classical, wn, stars, or, the, result, of, tidal, stripping, by, a, low, mass, companion, the, first, three, wolf, rayet, stars, to, be, identified, coincidentally, all, with, hot, o, class, companions, had, already, been, numbered, in, the, henry, draper, catalogue, these, stars, and, others, were, referred, to, as, wolf, rayet, stars, from, their, initial, discovery, but, specific, naming, conventions, for, them, would, not, be, created, until, 1962, in, the, fourth, catalogue, of, galactic, wolf, rayet, stars, the, first, three, catalogues, were, not, specifically, lists, of, wolf, rayet, stars, and, they, used, only, existing, nomenclature, the, fourth, catalogue, of, wolf, rayet, stars, numbered, them, sequentially, in, order, of, right, ascension, the, fifth, catalogue, used, the, same, numbers, prefixed, with, mr, after, the, author, of, the, fourth, catalogue, plus, an, additional, sequence, of, numbers, prefixed, with, ls, for, new, discoveries, neither, of, these, numbering, schemes, remains, in, common, use, the, sixth, catalogue, of, galactic, wolf, rayet, stars, was, the, first, to, actually, bear, that, name, as, well, as, to, describe, the, previous, five, catalogues, by, that, name, it, also, introduced, the, wr, numbers, widely, used, ever, since, for, galactic, wr, stars, these, are, again, a, numerical, sequence, from, wr, 1, to, wr, 158, in, order, of, right, ascension, compiled, in, 2001, the, seventh, catalogue, and, its, annex, used, the, same, numbering, scheme, and, inserted, new, stars, into, the, sequence, using, lower, case, letter, suffixes, for, example, wr, 102ka, for, one, of, the, numerous, wr, stars, discovered, in, the, galactic, centre, modern, high, volume, identification, surveys, use, their, own, numbering, schemes, for, the, large, numbers, of, new, discoveries, a, 2006, annex, was, added, to, the, seventh, catalog, in, 2011, an, online, galactic, wolf, rayet, catalogue, was, set, up, hosted, by, the, university, of, sheffield, as, of, 2023, it, includes, 669, stars, wolf, rayet, stars, in, external, galaxies, are, numbered, using, different, schemes, in, the, large, magellanic, cloud, the, most, widespread, and, complete, nomenclature, for, wr, stars, is, from, the, fourth, catalogue, of, population, i, wolf, rayet, stars, in, the, large, magellanic, cloud, prefixed, by, bat, 99, for, example, bat, 99, 105, many, of, these, stars, are, also, referred, to, by, their, third, catalogue, number, for, example, brey, 77, as, of, 2018, 154, wr, stars, are, catalogued, in, the, lmc, mostly, wn, but, including, about, twenty, three, wcs, as, well, as, three, of, the, extremely, rare, wo, class, many, of, these, stars, are, often, referred, to, by, their, rmc, radcliffe, observatory, magellanic, cloud, numbers, frequently, abbreviated, to, just, r, for, example, r136a1, in, the, small, magellanic, cloud, smc, wr, numbers, are, used, usually, referred, to, as, ab, numbers, for, example, ab7, there, are, only, twelve, known, wr, stars, in, the, smc, a, very, low, number, thought, to, be, due, to, the, low, metallicity, of, that, galaxy, in, 2012, an, iau, working, group, expanded, the, numbering, system, from, the, catalogue, of, galactic, wolf, rayet, stars, so, that, additional, discoveries, are, given, the, closest, existing, wr, number, plus, a, numeric, suffix, in, order, of, discovery, this, applies, to, all, discoveries, since, the, 2006, annex, although, some, of, these, have, already, been, named, under, the, previous, nomenclature, thus, wr, 42e, is, now, numbered, wr, 42, 1, wolf, rayet, stars, are, a, normal, stage, in, the, evolution, of, very, massive, stars, in, which, strong, broad, emission, lines, of, helium, and, nitrogen, wn, sequence, carbon, wc, sequence, and, oxygen, wo, sequence, are, visible, due, to, their, strong, emission, lines, they, can, be, identified, in, nearby, galaxies, about, 600, wolf, rayets, have, been, catalogued, in, our, own, milky, way, galaxy, this, number, has, changed, dramatically, during, the, last, few, years, as, the, result, of, photometric, and, spectroscopic, surveys, in, the, near, infrared, dedicated, to, discovering, this, kind, of, object, in, the, galactic, plane, it, is, expected, that, there, are, fewer, than, 1, 000, wr, stars, in, the, rest, of, the, local, group, galaxies, with, around, 166, known, in, the, magellanic, clouds, 206, in, the, triangulum, galaxy, and, 154, in, the, andromeda, galaxy, outside, the, local, group, whole, galaxy, surveys, have, found, thousands, more, wr, stars, and, candidates, for, example, in, the, m101, group, over, a, thousand, potential, wr, stars, have, been, detected, from, magnitude, 21, to, 25, and, astronomers, hope, to, eventually, catalog, over, ten, thousand, these, stars, are, expected, to, be, particularly, common, in, the, wolf, rayet, galaxies, named, after, them, and, in, starburst, galaxies, their, characteristic, emission, lines, are, formed, in, the, extended, and, dense, high, velocity, wind, region, enveloping, the, very, hot, stellar, photosphere, which, produces, a, flood, of, uv, radiation, that, causes, fluorescence, in, the, line, forming, wind, region, this, ejection, process, uncovers, in, succession, first, the, nitrogen, rich, products, of, cno, cycle, burning, of, hydrogen, wn, stars, and, later, the, carbon, rich, layer, due, to, he, burning, wc, and, wo, type, stars, it, can, be, seen, that, the, wnh, stars, are, completely, different, objects, from, the, wn, stars, without, hydrogen, despite, the, similar, spectra, they, are, much, more, massive, much, larger, and, some, of, the, most, luminous, stars, known, they, have, been, detected, as, early, as, wn5h, in, the, magellanic, clouds, the, nitrogen, seen, in, the, spectrum, of, wnh, stars, is, still, the, product, of, cno, cycle, fusion, in, the, core, but, it, appears, at, the, surface, of, the, most, massive, stars, due, to, rotational, and, convectional, mixing, while, still, in, the, core, hydrogen, burning, phase, rather, than, after, the, outer, envelope, is, lost, during, core, helium, fusion, some, wolf, rayet, stars, of, the, carbon, sequence, wc, especially, those, belonging, to, the, latest, types, are, noticeable, due, to, their, production, of, dust, usually, this, takes, place, on, those, belonging, to, binary, systems, as, a, product, of, the, collision, of, the, stellar, winds, forming, the, pair, as, is, the, case, of, the, famous, binary, wr, 104, however, this, process, occurs, on, single, ones, too, a, few, roughly, 10, of, the, central, stars, of, planetary, nebulae, despite, their, much, lower, masses, typically, 0, 6, m, are, also, observationally, of, the, wr, type, i, e, they, show, emission, line, spectra, with, broad, lines, from, helium, carbon, and, oxygen, denoted, they, are, much, older, objects, descended, from, evolved, low, mass, stars, and, are, closely, related, to, white, dwarfs, rather, than, to, the, very, young, very, massive, population, i, stars, that, comprise, the, bulk, of, the, wr, class, these, are, now, generally, excluded, from, the, class, denoted, as, wolf, rayet, stars, or, referred, to, as, wolf, rayet, type, stars, the, numbers, and, properties, of, wolf, rayet, stars, vary, with, the, chemical, composition, of, their, progenitor, stars, a, primary, driver, of, this, difference, is, the, rate, of, mass, loss, at, different, levels, of, metallicity, higher, metallicity, leads, to, high, mass, loss, which, affects, the, evolution, of, massive, stars, and, also, the, properties, of, wolf, rayet, stars, higher, levels, of, mass, loss, cause, stars, to, lose, their, outer, layers, before, an, iron, core, develops, and, collapses, so, that, the, more, massive, red, supergiants, evolve, back, to, hotter, temperatures, before, exploding, as, a, supernova, and, the, most, massive, stars, never, become, red, supergiants, in, the, wolf, rayet, stage, higher, mass, loss, leads, to, stronger, depletion, of, the, layers, outside, the, convective, core, lower, hydrogen, surface, abundances, and, more, rapid, stripping, of, helium, to, produce, a, wc, spectrum, these, trends, can, be, observed, in, the, various, galaxies, of, the, local, group, where, metallicity, varies, from, near, solar, levels, in, the, milky, way, somewhat, lower, in, m31, lower, still, in, the, large, magellanic, cloud, and, much, lower, in, the, small, magellanic,

and, more, wn, than, wc, types, lmc, and, especially, smc, wolf, rayets, have, weaker, emission, and, a, tendency, to, higher, atmospheric, hydrogen, fractions, smc, wr, stars, almost, universally,

they, can, continue, to, rotate, rapidly, even, at, the, highest, observed, masses, rapid, rotation, of, massive, stars, may, account, for, the, unexpected, properties, and, numbers, of, smc, wr, stars, for, example, their, relatively, high, temperatures, and, luminosities, massive, stars, in, binary, systems, can, develop, into, wolf, rayet, stars, due, to, stripping, by, a, companion, rather, than, inherent, mass, loss, due, to, a, stellar, wind, this, process, is, relatively, insensitive, to, the, metallicity, or, rotation, of, the, individual, stars, and, is, expected, to, produce, a, consistent, set, of, wr, stars, across, all, the, local, group, galaxies, as, a, result, the, fraction, of, wr, stars, produced, through, the, binary, channel, and, therefore, the, number, of, wr, stars, observed, to, be, in, binaries, should, be, higher, in, low, metallicity, environments, calculations, suggest, that, the, binary, fraction, of, wr, stars, observed, in, the, smc, should, be, as, high, as, 98, although, less, than, half, are, actually, observed, to, have, a, massive, companion, the, binary, fraction, in, the, milky, way, is, around, 20, in, line, with, theoretical, calculations, a, significant, proportion, of, wr, stars, are, surrounded, by, nebulosity, associated, directly, with, the, star, not, just, the, normal, background, nebulosity, associated, with, any, massive, star, forming, region, and, not, a, planetary, nebula, formed, by, a, post, agb, star, the, nebulosity, presents, a, variety, of, forms, and, classification, has, been, difficult, many, were, originally, catalogued, as, planetary, nebulae, and, sometimes, only, a, careful, multi, wavelength, study, can, distinguish, a, planetary, nebula, around, a, low, mass, post, agb, star, from, a, similarly, shaped, nebula, around, a, more, massive, core, helium, burning, star, a, wolf, rayet, galaxy, is, a, type, of, starburst, galaxy, where, a, sufficient, number, of, wr, stars, exist, that, their, characteristic, emission, line, spectra, become, visible, in, the, overall, spectrum, of, the, galaxy, specifically, a, broad, emission, feature, due, to, the, 468, 6, nm, he, ii, and, nearby, spectral, lines, is, the, defining, characteristic, of, a, wolf, rayet, galaxy, the, relatively, short, lifetime, of, wr, stars, means, that, the, starbursts, in, such, galaxies, must, have, occurred, within, the, last, few, million, years, and, must, have, lasted, less, than, a, million, years, or, else, the, wr, emission, would, be, swamped, by, large, numbers, of, other, luminous, stars, theories, about, how, wr, stars, form, develop, and, die, have, been, slow, to, form, compared, to, the, explanation, of, less, extreme, stellar, evolution, they, are, rare, distant, and, often, obscured, and, even, into, the, 21st, century, many, aspects, of, their, lives, are, unclear, although, wolf, rayet, stars, have, been, clearly, identified, as, an, unusual, and, distinctive, class, of, stars, since, the, 19th, century, the, nature, of, these, stars, was, uncertain, until, towards, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, before, the, 1960s, even, the, classification, of, wr, stars, was, highly, uncertain, and, their, nature, and, evolution, was, essentially, unknown, the, very, similar, appearance, of, the, central, stars, of, planetary, nebulae, cspne, and, the, much, more, luminous, classical, wr, stars, contributed, to, the, uncertainty, by, about, 1960, the, distinction, between, cspne, and, massive, luminous, classical, wr, stars, was, more, clear, studies, showed, that, they, were, small, dense, stars, surrounded, by, extensive, circumstellar, material, but, not, yet, clear, whether, the, material, was, expelled, from, the, star, or, contracting, onto, it, the, unusual, abundances, of, nitrogen, carbon, and, oxygen, as, well, as, the, lack, of, hydrogen, were, recognised, but, the, reasons, remained, obscure, it, was, recognised, that, wr, stars, were, very, young, and, very, rare, but, it, was, still, open, to, debate, whether, they, were, evolving, towards, or, away, from, the, main, sequence, by, the, 1980s, wr, stars, were, accepted, as, the, descendants, of, massive, ob, stars, although, their, exact, evolutionary, state, in, relation, to, the, main, sequence, and, other, evolved, massive, stars, was, still, unknown, theories, that, the, preponderance, of, wr, stars, in, massive, binaries, and, their, lack, of, hydrogen, could, be, due, to, gravitational, stripping, had, been, largely, ignored, or, abandoned, wr, stars, were, being, proposed, as, possible, progenitors, of, supernovae, and, particularly, the, newly, discovered, type, ib, supernovae, lacking, hydrogen, but, apparently, associated, with, young, massive, stars, by, the, start, of, the, 21st, century, wr, stars, were, largely, accepted, as, massive, stars, that, had, exhausted, their, core, hydrogen, left, the, main, sequence, and, expelled, most, of, their, atmospheres, leaving, behind, a, small, hot, core, of, helium, and, heavier, fusion, products, most, wr, stars, the, classical, population, i, type, are, now, understood, as, being, a, natural, stage, in, the, evolution, of, the, most, massive, stars, not, counting, the, less, common, planetary, nebula, central, stars, either, after, a, period, as, a, red, supergiant, after, a, period, as, a, blue, supergiant, or, directly, from, the, most, massive, main, sequence, stars, only, the, lower, mass, red, supergiants, are, expected, to, explode, as, a, supernova, at, that, stage, while, more, massive, red, supergiants, progress, back, to, hotter, temperatures, as, they, expel, their, atmospheres, some, explode, while, at, the, yellow, hypergiant, or, lbv, stage, but, many, become, wolf, rayet, stars, they, have, lost, or, burnt, almost, all, of, their, hydrogen, and, are, now, fusing, helium, in, their, cores, or, heavier, elements, for, a, very, brief, period, at, the, end, of, their, lives, massive, main, sequence, stars, create, a, very, hot, core, which, fuses, hydrogen, very, rapidly, via, the, cno, process, and, results, in, strong, convection, throughout, the, whole, star, this, causes, mixing, of, helium, to, the, surface, a, process, that, is, enhanced, by, rotation, possibly, by, differential, rotation, where, the, core, is, spun, up, to, a, faster, rotation, than, the, surface, such, stars, also, show, nitrogen, enhancement, at, the, surface, at, a, very, young, age, caused, by, changes, in, the, proportions, of, carbon, and, nitrogen, due, to, the, cno, cycle, the, enhancement, of, heavy, elements, in, the, atmosphere, as, well, as, increases, in, luminosity, create, strong, stellar, winds, which, are, the, source, of, the, emission, line, spectra, these, stars, develop, an, of, spectrum, of, if, they, are, sufficiently, hot, which, develops, into, a, wnh, spectrum, as, the, stellar, winds, increase, further, this, explains, the, high, mass, and, luminosity, of, the, wnh, stars, which, are, still, burning, hydrogen, at, the, core, and, have, lost, little, of, their, initial, mass, these, will, eventually, expand, into, blue, supergiants, lbvs, as, hydrogen, at, the, core, becomes, depleted, or, if, mixing, is, efficient, enough, e, g, through, rapid, rotation, they, may, progress, directly, to, wn, stars, without, hydrogen, wr, stars, are, likely, to, end, their, lives, violently, rather, than, fade, away, to, a, white, dwarf, thus, every, star, with, an, initial, mass, more, than, about, 9, times, the, sun, would, inevitably, result, in, a, supernova, explosion, with, the, exception, of, direct, collapse, many, of, them, from, the, wr, stage, a, simple, progression, of, wr, stars, from, low, to, hot, temperatures, resulting, finally, in, wo, type, stars, is, not, supported, by, observation, wo, type, stars, are, extremely, rare, and, all, the, known, examples, are, more, luminous, and, more, massive, than, the, relatively, common, wc, stars, alternative, theories, suggest, either, that, the, wo, type, stars, are, only, formed, from, the, most, massive, main, sequence, stars, and, or, that, they, form, an, extremely, short, lived, end, stage, of, just, a, few, thousand, years, before, exploding, with, the, wc, phase, corresponding, to, the, core, helium, burning, phase, and, the, wo, phase, to, nuclear, burning, stages, beyond, it, is, still, unclear, whether, the, wo, spectrum, is, purely, the, result, of, ionisation, effects, at, very, high, temperature, reflects, an, actual, chemical, abundance, difference, or, if, both, effects, occur, to, varying, degrees, key, wolf, rayet, stars, form, from, massive, stars, although, the, evolved, population, i, stars, have, lost, half, or, more, of, their, initial, masses, by, the, time, they, show, a, wr, appearance, for, example, 2, velorum, a, currently, has, a, mass, around, 9, times, the, sun, but, began, with, a, mass, at, least, 40, times, the, sun, high, mass, stars, are, very, rare, both, because, they, form, less, often, and, because, they, have, short, lives, this, means, that, wolf, rayet, stars, themselves, are, extremely, rare, because, they, only, form, from, the, most, massive, main, sequence, stars, and, because, they, are, a, relatively, short, lived, phase, in, the, lives, of, those, stars, this, also, explains, why, type, ib, c, supernovae, are, less, common, than, type, ii, since, they, result, from, higher, mass, stars, wnh, stars, spectroscopically, similar, but, actually, a, much, less, evolved, star, which, has, only, just, started, to, expel, its, atmosphere, are, an, exception, and, still, retain, much, of, their, initial, mass, the, most, massive, stars, currently, known, are, all, wnh, stars, rather, than, o, type, main, sequence, stars, an, expected, situation, because, such, stars, show, helium, and, nitrogen, at, the, surface, only, a, few, thousand, years, after, they, form, possibly, before, they, become, visible, through, the, surrounding, gas, cloud, an, alternative, explanation, is, that, these, stars, are, so, massive, that, they, could, not, form, as, normal, main, sequence, stars, instead, being, the, result, of, mergers, of, less, extreme, stars, the, difficulties, of, modelling, the, observed, numbers, and, types, of, wolf, rayet, stars, through, single, star, evolution, have, led, to, theories, that, they, form, through, binary, interactions, which, could, accelerate, loss, of, the, outer, layers, of, a, star, through, mass, exchange, wr, 122, is, a, potential, example, that, has, a, flat, disk, of, gas, encircling, the, star, almost, 2, trillion, miles, wide, and, may, have, a, companion, star, that, stripped, its, outer, envelope, it, is, widely, suspected, that, many, type, ib, and, type, ic, supernova, progenitors, are, wr, stars, although, no, conclusive, identification, has, been, made, of, such, a, progenitor, type, ib, supernovae, lack, hydrogen, lines, in, their, spectra, the, more, common, type, ic, supernovae, lack, both, hydrogen, and, helium, lines, in, their, spectra, the, expected, progenitors, for, such, supernova, are, massive, stars, that, respectively, lack, hydrogen, in, their, outer, layers, or, lack, both, hydrogen, and, helium, wr, stars, are, just, such, objects, all, wr, stars, lack, hydrogen, and, in, some, wr, stars, most, notably, the, wo, group, helium, is, also, strongly, depleted, wr, stars, are, expected, to, experience, core, collapse, when, they, have, generated, an, iron, core, and, resulting, supernova, explosions, would, be, of, type, ib, or, ic, in, some, cases, it, is, possible, that, direct, collapse, of, the, core, to, a, black, hole, would, not, produce, a, visible, explosion, wr, stars, are, very, luminous, due, to, their, high, temperatures, but, not, visually, bright, especially, the, hottest, examples, that, are, expected, to, make, up, most, supernova, progenitors, theory, suggests, that, the, progenitors, of, type, ibc, supernovae, observed, to, date, would, not, be, bright, enough, to, be, detected, although, they, place, constraints, on, the, properties, of, those, progenitors, a, possible, progenitor, star, which, has, disappeared, at, the, location, of, supernova, iptf13bvn, may, be, a, single, wr, star, although, other, analyses, favour, a, less, massive, binary, system, with, a, stripped, star, or, helium, giant, the, only, other, possible, wr, supernova, progenitor, is, for, sn, 2017ein, and, again, it, is, uncertain, whether, the, progenitor, is, a, single, massive, wr, star, or, binary, system, in, 2022, astronomers, from, the, gran, telescopio, canarias, reported, the, first, supernova, explosion, of, a, wolf, rayet, star, sn, 2019hgp, was, a, type, icn, supernova, and, is, also, the, first, in, which, the, element, neon, has, been, detected, by, far, the, most, visible, example, of, a, wolf, rayet, star, is, 2, velorum, wr, 11, which, is, a, bright, naked, eye, star, for, those, located, south, of, 40, degrees, northern, latitude, although, most, of, the, light, comes, from, an, o7, 5, giant, companion, due, to, the, exotic, nature, of, its, spectrum, bright, emission, lines, in, lieu, of, dark, absorption, lines, it, is, dubbed, the, spectral, gem, of, the, southern, skies, the, only, other, wolf, rayet, star, brighter, than, magnitude, 6, is, muscae, wr, 48, a, triple, star, with, two, o, class, companions, both, are, wc, stars, the, ex, wr, star, wr, 79a, hr, 6272, is, brighter, than, magnitude, 6, but, is, now, considered, to, be, a, peculiar, o8, supergiant, with, strong, emission, the, next, brightest, at, magnitude, 6, 4, is, wr, 22, a, massive, binary, with, a, wn7h, primary, the, most, massive, and, most, luminous, star, currently, known, r136a1, is, also, a, wolf, rayet, star, of, the, wnh, type, that, is, still, fusing, hydrogen, in, its, core, this, type, of, star, which, includes, many, of, the, most, luminous, and, most, massive, stars, is, very, young, and, usually, found, only, in, the, centre, of, the, densest, star, clusters, occasionally, a, runaway, wnh, star, such, as, vfts, 682, is, found, outside, such, clusters, probably, having, been, ejected, from, a, multiple, system, or, by, interaction, with, other, stars, an, example, of, a, triple, star, system, containing, a, wolf, rayet, binary, is, apep, it, releases, huge, amounts, of, carbon, dust, driven, by, their, extreme, stellar, winds, as, the, two, stars, orbit, one, another, the, dust, gets, wrapped, into, a, glowing, sooty, tail, all, of, the, very, hottest, non, degenerate, stars, the, hottest, few, are, wolf, rayet, stars, the, hottest, of, which, being, wr, 102, which, seems, to, be, as, hot, as, 210, 000, k, followed, by, wr, 142, which, is, around, 200, 000, k, in, temperature, lmc195, 1, located, in, the, large, magellanic, cloud, should, have, a, similar, temperature, but, at, the, moment, this, temperature, is, unknown, hd, 45166, has, been, described, as, the, most, magnetic, massive, star, known, and, as, the, first, magnetic, known, wolf, rayet,
