winter, is, the, coldest, and, darkest, season, of, the, year, in, polar, and, temperate, climates, it, occurs, after, autumn, and, before, spring, the, tilt, of, earth, s, axis, causes, seasons, winter, occurs, when, a, hemisphere, is, oriented, away, from, the, sun, different, cultures, define, different, dates, as, the, start, of, winter, and, some, use, a, definition, based, on, weather, when, it, is, winter, in, the, northern, hemisphere, it, is, summer, in, the, southern, hemisphere, and, vice, versa, winter, typically, brings, precipitation, that, depending, on, a, region, s, climate, is, mainly, rain, or, snow, the, moment, of, winter, solstice, is, when, the, sun, s, elevation, with, respect, to, the, north, or, south, pole, is, at, its, most, negative, value, that, is, the, sun, is, at, its, farthest, below, the, horizon, as, measured, from, the, pole, the, day, on, which, this, occurs, has, the, shortest, day, and, the, longest, night, with, day, length, increasing, and, night, length, decreasing, as, the, season, progresses, after, the, solstice, the, earliest, sunset, and, latest, sunrise, dates, outside, the, polar, regions, differ, from, the, date, of, the, winter, solstice, and, depend, on, latitude, they, differ, due, to, the, variation, in, the, solar, day, throughout, the, year, caused, by, the, earth, s, elliptical, orbit, see, earliest, and, latest, sunrise, and, sunset, the, english, word, winter, comes, from, the, proto, germanic, noun, wintru, whose, origin, is, unclear, several, proposals, exist, a, commonly, mentioned, one, connecting, it, to, the, proto, indo, european, root, wed, water, or, a, nasal, infix, variant, wend, the, tilt, of, the, earth, s, axis, relative, to, its, orbital, plane, plays, a, large, role, in, the, formation, of, weather, the, earth, is, tilted, at, an, angle, of, 23, 44, to, the, plane, of, its, orbit, causing, different, latitudes, to, directly, face, the, sun, as, the, earth, moves, through, its, orbit, this, variation, brings, about, seasons, when, it, is, winter, in, the, northern, hemisphere, the, southern, hemisphere, faces, the, sun, more, directly, and, thus, experiences, warmer, temperatures, than, the, northern, hemisphere, conversely, winter, in, the, southern, hemisphere, occurs, when, the, northern, hemisphere, is, tilted, more, toward, the, sun, from, the, perspective, of, an, observer, on, the, earth, the, winter, sun, has, a, lower, maximum, altitude, in, the, sky, than, the, summer, sun, during, winter, in, either, hemisphere, the, lower, altitude, of, the, sun, causes, the, sunlight, to, hit, the, earth, at, an, oblique, angle, thus, a, lower, amount, of, solar, radiation, strikes, the, earth, per, unit, of, surface, area, furthermore, the, light, must, travel, a, longer, distance, through, the, atmosphere, allowing, the, atmosphere, to, dissipate, more, heat, compared, with, these, effects, the, effect, of, the, changes, in, the, distance, of, the, earth, from, the, sun, due, to, the, earth, s, elliptical, orbit, is, negligible, the, manifestation, of, the, meteorological, winter, freezing, temperatures, in, the, northerly, snow, prone, latitudes, is, highly, variable, depending, on, elevation, position, versus, marine, winds, and, the, amount, of, precipitation, for, instance, within, canada, a, country, of, cold, winters, winnipeg, on, the, great, plains, a, long, way, from, the, ocean, has, a, january, high, of, 11, 3, c, 11, 7, f, and, a, low, of, 21, 4, c, 6, 5, f, in, comparison, vancouver, on, the, west, coast, with, a, marine, influence, from, moderating, pacific, winds, has, a, january, low, of, 1, 4, c, 34, 5, f, with, days, well, above, freezing, at, 6, 9, c, 44, 4, f, both, places, are, at, 49, n, latitude, and, in, the, same, western, half, of, the, continent, a, similar, but, less, extreme, effect, is, found, in, europe, in, spite, of, their, northerly, latitude, the, british, isles, have, not, a, single, non, mountain, weather, station, with, a, below, freezing, mean, january, temperature, meteorological, reckoning, is, the, method, of, measuring, the, winter, season, used, by, meteorologists, based, on, sensible, weather, patterns, for, record, keeping, purposes, so, the, start, of, meteorological, winter, varies, with, latitude, winter, is, often, defined, by, meteorologists, to, be, the, three, calendar, months, with, the, lowest, average, temperatures, this, corresponds, to, the, months, of, december, january, and, february, in, the, northern, hemisphere, and, june, july, and, august, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, coldest, average, temperatures, of, the, season, are, typically, experienced, in, january, or, february, in, the, northern, hemisphere, and, in, june, july, or, august, in, the, southern, hemisphere, nighttime, predominates, in, the, winter, season, and, in, some, regions, winter, has, the, highest, rate, of, precipitation, as, well, as, prolonged, dampness, because, of, permanent, snow, cover, or, high, precipitation, rates, coupled, with, low, temperatures, precluding, evaporation, blizzards, often, develop, and, cause, many, transportation, delays, diamond, dust, also, known, as, ice, needles, or, ice, crystals, forms, at, temperatures, approaching, 40, c, 40, f, due, to, air, with, slightly, higher, moisture, from, above, mixing, with, colder, surface, based, air, they, are, made, of, simple, hexagonal, ice, crystals, the, swedish, meteorological, institute, smhi, defines, thermal, winter, as, when, the, daily, mean, temperatures, are, below, 0, c, 32, f, for, five, consecutive, days, according, to, the, smhi, winter, in, scandinavia, is, more, pronounced, when, atlantic, low, pressure, systems, take, more, southerly, and, northerly, routes, leaving, the, path, open, for, high, pressure, systems, to, come, in, and, cold, temperatures, to, occur, as, a, result, the, coldest, january, on, record, in, stockholm, in, 1987, was, also, the, sunniest, accumulations, of, snow, and, ice, are, commonly, associated, with, winter, in, the, northern, hemisphere, due, to, the, large, land, masses, there, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, more, maritime, climate, and, the, relative, lack, of, land, south, of, 40, s, make, the, winters, milder, thus, snow, and, ice, are, less, common, in, inhabited, regions, of, the, southern, hemisphere, in, this, region, snow, occurs, every, year, in, elevated, regions, such, as, the, andes, the, great, dividing, range, in, australia, and, the, mountains, of, new, zealand, and, also, in, the, southerly, patagonia, region, of, south, argentina, snow, occurs, year, round, in, antarctica, in, the, northern, hemisphere, some, authorities, define, the, period, of, winter, based, on, astronomical, fixed, points, i, e, based, solely, on, the, position, of, the, earth, in, its, orbit, around, the, sun, regardless, of, weather, conditions, in, one, version, of, this, definition, winter, begins, at, the, winter, solstice, and, ends, at, the, march, equinox, these, dates, are, somewhat, later, than, those, used, to, define, the, beginning, and, end, of, the, meteorological, winter, usually, considered, to, span, the, entirety, of, december, january, and, february, in, the, northern, hemisphere, and, june, july, and, august, in, the, southern, astronomically, the, winter, solstice, being, the, day, of, the, year, that, has, fewest, hours, of, daylight, ought, to, be, in, the, middle, of, the, season, but, seasonal, lag, means, that, the, coldest, period, normally, follows, the, solstice, by, a, few, weeks, in, some, cultures, the, season, is, regarded, as, beginning, at, the, solstice, and, ending, on, the, following, equinox, in, the, northern, hemisphere, depending, on, the, year, this, corresponds, to, the, period, between, 20, 21, or, 22, december, and, 19, 20, or, 21, march, in, an, old, norwegian, tradition, winter, begins, on, 14, october, and, ends, on, the, last, day, of, february, in, many, countries, in, the, southern, hemisphere, including, australia, new, zealand, and, south, africa, winter, begins, on, 1, june, and, ends, on, 31, august, in, celtic, nations, such, as, ireland, using, the, irish, calendar, and, in, scandinavia, the, winter, solstice, is, traditionally, considered, as, midwinter, with, the, winter, season, beginning, 1, november, on, all, hallows, or, samhain, winter, ends, and, spring, begins, on, imbolc, or, candlemas, which, is, 1, or, 2, february, in, chinese, astronomy, and, other, east, asian, calendars, winter, is, taken, to, commence, on, or, around, 7, november, on, l, d, ng, and, end, with, the, arrival, of, spring, on, 3, or, 4, february, on, l, ch, n, late, roman, republic, scholar, marcus, terentius, varro, defined, winter, as, lasting, from, the, fourth, day, before, the, ides, of, november, 10, november, to, the, eighth, day, before, the, ides, of, februarius, 6, february, this, system, of, seasons, is, based, on, the, length, of, days, exclusively, the, three, month, period, of, the, shortest, days, and, weakest, solar, radiation, occurs, during, november, december, and, january, in, the, northern, hemisphere, and, may, june, and, july, in, the, southern, hemisphere, many, mainland, european, countries, tended, to, recognize, martinmas, or, st, martin, s, day, 11, november, as, the, first, calendar, day, of, winter, the, day, falls, at, the, midpoint, between, the, old, julian, equinox, and, solstice, dates, also, valentine, s, day, 14, february, is, recognized, by, some, countries, as, heralding, the, first, rites, of, spring, such, as, flowers, blooming, the, three, month, period, associated, with, the, coldest, average, temperatures, typically, begins, somewhere, in, late, november, or, early, december, in, the, northern, hemisphere, and, lasts, through, late, february, or, early, march, this, thermological, winter, is, earlier, than, the, solstice, delimited, definition, but, later, than, the, daylight, celtic, or, chinese, definition, depending, on, seasonal, lag, this, period, will, vary, between, climatic, regions, since, by, almost, all, definitions, valid, for, the, northern, hemisphere, winter, spans, 31, december, and, 1, january, the, season, is, split, across, years, just, like, summer, in, the, southern, hemisphere, each, calendar, year, includes, parts, of, two, winters, this, causes, ambiguity, in, associating, a, winter, with, a, particular, year, e, g, winter, 2018, solutions, for, this, problem, include, naming, both, years, e, g, winter, 18, 19, or, settling, on, the, year, the, season, starts, in, or, on, the, year, most, of, its, days, belong, to, which, is, the, later, year, for, most, definitions, ecological, reckoning, of, winter, differs, from, calendar, based, by, avoiding, the, use, of, fixed, dates, it, is, one, of, six, seasons, recognized, by, most, ecologists, who, customarily, use, the, term, hibernal, for, this, period, of, the, year, the, other, ecological, seasons, being, prevernal, vernal, estival, serotinal, and, autumnal, the, hibernal, season, coincides, with, the, main, period, of, biological, dormancy, each, year, whose, dates, vary, according, to, local, and, regional, climates, in, temperate, zones, of, the, earth, the, appearance, of, flowering, plants, like, the, crocus, can, mark, the, change, from, ecological, winter, to, the, prevernal, season, as, early, as, late, january, in, mild, temperate, climates, to, survive, the, harshness, of, winter, many, animals, have, developed, different, behavioral, and, morphological, adaptations, for, overwintering, some, annual, plants, never, survive, the, winter, other, annual, plants, require, winter, cold, to, complete, their, life, cycle, this, is, known, as, vernalization, as, for, perennials, many, small, ones, profit, from, the, insulating, effects, of, snow, by, being, buried, in, it, larger, plants, particularly, deciduous, trees, usually, let, their, upper, part, go, dormant, but, their, roots, are, still, protected, by, the, snow, layer, few, plants, bloom, in, the, winter, one, exception, being, the, flowering, plum, which, flowers, in, time, for, chinese, new, year, the, process, by, which, plants, become, acclimated, to, cold, weather, is, called, hardening, humans, are, sensitive, to, winter, cold, which, compromises, the, body, s, ability, to, maintain, both, core, and, surface, heat, of, the, body, slipping, on, icy, surfaces, is, a, common, cause, of, winter, injuries, other, injuries, from, the, cold, include, rates, of, influenza, covid, 19, and, other, respiratory, diseases, also, increase, during, the, winter, in, persian, culture, the, winter, solstice, is, called, yald, meaning, birth, and, has, been, celebrated, for, thousands, of, years, it, is, referred, to, as, the, eve, of, the, birth, of, mithra, who, symbolised, light, goodness, and, strength, on, earth, in, greek, mythology, hades, kidnapped, persephone, to, be, his, wife, zeus, ordered, hades, to, return, her, to, demeter, the, goddess, of, the, earth, and, her, mother, hades, tricked, persephone, into, eating, the, food, of, the, dead, so, zeus, decreed, that, she, spend, six, months, with, demeter, and, six, months, with, hades, during, the, time, her, daughter, is, with, hades, demeter, became, depressed, and, caused, winter, in, welsh, mythology, gwyn, ap, nudd, abducted, a, maiden, named, creiddylad, on, may, day, her, lover, gwythr, ap, greidawl, fought, gwyn, to, win, her, back, the, battle, between, them, represented, the, contest, between, summer, and, winter
