hydrofluoric, acid, is, a, solution, of, hydrogen, fluoride, hf, in, water, solutions, of, hf, are, colorless, acidic, and, highly, corrosive, a, common, concentration, is, 49, 48, 52, but, there, are, also, stronger, solutions, e, g, 70, and, pure, hf, has, a, boiling, point, near, room, temperature, it, is, used, to, make, most, fluorine, containing, compounds, examples, include, the, commonly, used, pharmaceutical, antidepressant, medication, fluoxetine, prozac, and, the, material, ptfe, teflon, elemental, fluorine, is, produced, from, it, it, is, commonly, used, to, etch, glass, and, silicon, wafers, the, principal, use, of, hydrofluoric, acid, is, in, organofluorine, chemistry, many, organofluorine, compounds, are, prepared, using, hf, as, the, fluorine, source, including, teflon, fluoropolymers, fluorocarbons, and, refrigerants, such, as, freon, many, pharmaceuticals, contain, fluorine, most, high, volume, inorganic, fluoride, compounds, are, prepared, from, hydrofluoric, acid, foremost, are, na, 3, alf, 6, cryolite, and, alf, 3, aluminium, trifluoride, a, molten, mixture, of, these, solids, serves, as, a, high, temperature, solvent, for, the, production, of, metallic, aluminium, other, inorganic, fluorides, prepared, from, hydrofluoric, acid, include, sodium, fluoride, and, uranium, hexafluoride, it, is, used, in, the, semiconductor, industry, as, a, major, component, of, wright, etch, and, buffered, oxide, etch, which, are, used, to, clean, silicon, wafers, in, a, similar, manner, it, is, also, used, to, etch, glass, by, treatment, with, silicon, dioxide, to, form, gaseous, or, water, soluble, silicon, fluorides, it, can, also, be, used, to, polish, and, frost, glass, a, 5, to, 9, hydrofluoric, acid, gel, is, also, commonly, used, to, etch, all, ceramic, dental, restorations, to, improve, bonding, for, similar, reasons, dilute, hydrofluoric, acid, is, a, component, of, household, rust, stain, remover, in, car, washes, in, wheel, cleaner, compounds, in, ceramic, and, fabric, rust, inhibitors, and, in, water, spot, removers, because, of, its, ability, to, dissolve, iron, oxides, as, well, as, silica, based, contaminants, hydrofluoric, acid, is, used, in, pre, commissioning, boilers, that, produce, high, pressure, steam, hydrofluoric, acid, is, also, useful, for, dissolving, rock, samples, usually, powdered, prior, to, analysis, in, similar, manner, this, acid, is, used, in, acid, macerations, to, extract, organic, fossils, from, silicate, rocks, fossiliferous, rock, may, be, immersed, directly, into, the, acid, or, a, cellulose, nitrate, film, may, be, applied, dissolved, in, amyl, acetate, which, adheres, to, the, organic, component, and, allows, the, rock, to, be, dissolved, around, it, in, a, standard, oil, refinery, process, known, as, alkylation, isobutane, is, alkylated, with, low, molecular, weight, alkenes, primarily, a, mixture, of, propylene, and, butylene, in, the, presence, of, an, acid, catalyst, derived, from, hydrofluoric, acid, the, catalyst, protonates, the, alkenes, propylene, butylene, to, produce, reactive, carbocations, which, alkylate, isobutane, the, reaction, is, carried, out, at, mild, temperatures, 0, and, 30, c, in, a, two, phase, reaction, hydrofluoric, acid, was, first, prepared, in, 1771, by, carl, wilhelm, scheele, it, is, now, mainly, produced, by, treatment, of, the, mineral, fluorite, caf, 2, with, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, at, approximately, 265, c, the, acid, is, also, a, by, product, of, the, production, of, phosphoric, acid, from, apatite, and, fluoroapatite, digestion, of, the, mineral, with, sulfuric, acid, at, elevated, temperatures, releases, a, mixture, of, gases, including, hydrogen, fluoride, which, may, be, recovered, because, of, its, high, reactivity, toward, glass, hydrofluoric, acid, is, stored, in, fluorinated, plastic, often, ptfe, containers, in, dilute, aqueous, solution, hydrogen, fluoride, behaves, as, a, weak, acid, infrared, spectroscopy, has, been, used, to, show, that, in, solution, dissociation, is, accompanied, by, formation, of, the, ion, pair, h, 3, o, f, this, ion, pair, has, been, characterized, in, the, crystalline, state, at, very, low, temperature, further, association, has, been, characterized, both, in, solution, and, in, the, solid, state, it, is, assumed, that, polymerization, occurs, as, the, concentration, increases, this, assumption, is, supported, by, the, isolation, of, a, salt, of, a, tetrameric, anion, h, 3, f, 4, and, by, low, temperature, x, ray, crystallography, the, species, that, are, present, in, concentrated, aqueous, solutions, of, hydrogen, fluoride, have, not, all, been, characterized, in, addition, to, hf, 2, which, is, known, the, formation, of, other, polymeric, species, h, n, 1, f, n, is, highly, likely, the, hammett, acidity, function, h, 0, for, 100, hf, was, first, reported, as, 10, 2, while, later, compilations, show, 11, comparable, to, values, near, 12, for, pure, sulfuric, acid, unlike, other, hydrohalic, acids, such, as, hydrochloric, acid, hydrogen, fluoride, is, only, a, weak, acid, in, dilute, aqueous, solution, this, is, in, part, a, result, of, the, strength, of, the, hydrogen, fluorine, bond, but, also, of, other, factors, such, as, the, tendency, of, hf, h, 2, o, and, f, anions, to, form, clusters, at, high, concentrations, hf, molecules, undergo, homoassociation, to, form, polyatomic, ions, such, as, bifluoride, hf, 2, and, protons, thus, greatly, increasing, the, acidity, this, leads, to, protonation, of, very, strong, acids, like, hydrochloric, sulfuric, or, nitric, acids, when, using, concentrated, hydrofluoric, acid, solutions, although, hydrofluoric, acid, is, regarded, as, a, weak, acid, it, is, very, corrosive, even, attacking, glass, when, hydrated, dilute, solutions, are, weakly, acidic, with, an, acid, ionization, constant, k, a, 6, 6, 10, 4, or, p, k, a, 3, 18, in, contrast, to, corresponding, solutions, of, the, other, hydrogen, halides, which, are, strong, acids, p, k, a, 0, however, concentrated, solutions, of, hydrogen, fluoride, are, much, more, strongly, acidic, than, implied, by, this, value, as, shown, by, measurements, of, the, hammett, acidity, function, h, 0, or, effective, ph, during, self, ionization, of, 100, liquid, hf, the, h, 0, was, first, measured, as, 10, 2, and, later, compiled, as, 11, comparable, to, values, near, 12, for, sulfuric, acid, in, thermodynamic, terms, hf, solutions, are, highly, non, ideal, with, the, activity, of, hf, increasing, much, more, rapidly, than, its, concentration, the, weak, acidity, in, dilute, solution, is, sometimes, attributed, to, the, high, h, f, bond, strength, which, combines, with, the, high, dissolution, enthalpy, of, hf, to, outweigh, the, more, negative, enthalpy, of, hydration, of, the, fluoride, ion, paul, gigu, re, and, sylvia, turrell, have, shown, by, infrared, spectroscopy, that, the, predominant, solute, species, in, dilute, solution, is, the, hydrogen, bonded, ion, pair, h, 3, o, f, with, increasing, concentration, of, hf, the, concentration, of, the, hydrogen, difluoride, ion, also, increases, the, reaction, is, an, example, of, homoconjugation, in, addition, to, being, a, highly, corrosive, liquid, hydrofluoric, acid, is, also, a, powerful, contact, poison, since, it, can, penetrate, tissue, poisoning, can, occur, readily, through, exposure, of, skin, or, eyes, inhalation, or, ingestion, symptoms, of, exposure, to, hydrofluoric, acid, may, not, be, immediately, evident, and, this, can, provide, false, reassurance, to, victims, causing, them, to, delay, medical, treatment, despite, its, irritating, vapor, hf, may, reach, dangerous, levels, without, an, obvious, odor, it, interferes, with, nerve, function, meaning, that, burns, may, not, initially, be, painful, accidental, exposures, can, go, unnoticed, delaying, treatment, and, increasing, the, extent, and, seriousness, of, the, injury, symptoms, of, hf, exposure, include, irritation, of, the, eyes, skin, nose, and, throat, eye, and, skin, burns, rhinitis, bronchitis, pulmonary, edema, fluid, buildup, in, the, lungs, and, bone, damage, due, to, hf, strongly, interacting, with, calcium, in, bones, in, a, concentrated, form, hf, can, cause, severe, tissue, destruction, through, lesions, and, mucous, membrane, damage, but, dilute, hf, is, still, dangerous, because, of, its, high, lipid, affinity, leading, to, cellular, death, of, nerves, blood, vessels, tendons, bones, and, other, tissues, hydrofluoric, burns, are, treated, with, a, calcium, gluconate, gel
