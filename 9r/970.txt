newton, s, laws, of, motion, are, three, physical, laws, that, describe, the, relationship, between, the, motion, of, an, object, and, the, forces, acting, on, it, these, laws, which, provide, the, basis, for, newtonian, mechanics, can, be, paraphrased, as, follows, the, three, laws, of, motion, were, first, stated, by, isaac, newton, in, his, philosophi, naturalis, principia, mathematica, mathematical, principles, of, natural, philosophy, originally, published, in, 1687, newton, used, them, to, investigate, and, explain, the, motion, of, many, physical, objects, and, systems, in, the, time, since, newton, new, insights, especially, around, the, concept, of, energy, built, the, field, of, classical, mechanics, on, his, foundations, limitations, to, newton, s, laws, have, also, been, discovered, new, theories, are, necessary, when, objects, move, at, very, high, speeds, special, relativity, are, very, massive, general, relativity, or, are, very, small, quantum, mechanics, newton, s, laws, are, often, stated, in, terms, of, point, or, particle, masses, that, is, bodies, whose, volume, is, negligible, this, is, a, reasonable, approximation, for, real, bodies, when, the, motion, of, internal, parts, can, be, neglected, and, when, the, separation, between, bodies, is, much, larger, than, the, size, of, each, for, instance, the, earth, and, the, sun, can, both, be, approximated, as, pointlike, when, considering, the, orbit, of, the, former, around, the, latter, but, the, earth, is, not, pointlike, when, considering, activities, on, its, surface, the, mathematical, description, of, motion, or, kinematics, is, based, on, the, idea, of, specifying, positions, using, numerical, coordinates, movement, is, represented, by, these, numbers, changing, over, time, a, body, s, trajectory, is, represented, by, a, function, that, assigns, to, each, value, of, a, time, variable, the, values, of, all, the, position, coordinates, the, simplest, case, is, one, dimensional, that, is, when, a, body, is, constrained, to, move, only, along, a, straight, line, its, position, can, then, be, given, by, a, single, number, indicating, where, it, is, relative, to, some, chosen, reference, point, for, example, a, body, might, be, free, to, slide, along, a, track, that, runs, left, to, right, and, so, its, location, can, be, specified, by, its, distance, from, a, convenient, zero, point, or, origin, with, negative, numbers, indicating, positions, to, the, left, and, positive, numbers, indicating, positions, to, the, right, if, the, body, s, location, as, a, function, of, time, is, s, t, displaystyle, s, t, then, its, average, velocity, over, the, time, interval, from, t, 0, displaystyle, t, 0, to, t, 1, displaystyle, t, 1, is, s, t, s, t, 1, s, t, 0, t, 1, t, 0, displaystyle, frac, delta, s, delta, t, frac, s, t, 1, s, t, 0, t, 1, t, 0, here, the, greek, letter, displaystyle, delta, delta, is, used, per, tradition, to, mean, change, in, a, positive, average, velocity, means, that, the, position, coordinate, s, displaystyle, s, increases, over, the, interval, in, question, a, negative, average, velocity, indicates, a, net, decrease, over, that, interval, and, an, average, velocity, of, zero, means, that, the, body, ends, the, time, interval, in, the, same, place, as, it, began, calculus, gives, the, means, to, define, an, instantaneous, velocity, a, measure, of, a, body, s, speed, and, direction, of, movement, at, a, single, moment, of, time, rather, than, over, an, interval, one, notation, for, the, instantaneous, velocity, is, to, replace, displaystyle, delta, with, the, symbol, d, displaystyle, d, for, example, v, d, s, d, t, displaystyle, v, frac, ds, dt, this, denotes, that, the, instantaneous, velocity, is, the, derivative, of, the, position, with, respect, to, time, it, can, roughly, be, thought, of, as, the, ratio, between, an, infinitesimally, small, change, in, position, d, s, displaystyle, ds, to, the, infinitesimally, small, time, interval, d, t, displaystyle, dt, over, which, it, occurs, more, carefully, the, velocity, and, all, other, derivatives, can, be, defined, using, the, concept, of, a, limit, a, function, f, t, displaystyle, f, t, has, a, limit, of, l, displaystyle, l, at, a, given, input, value, t, 0, displaystyle, t, 0, if, the, difference, between, f, displaystyle, f, and, l, displaystyle, l, can, be, made, arbitrarily, small, by, choosing, an, input, sufficiently, close, to, t, 0, displaystyle, t, 0, one, writes, lim, t, t, 0, f, t, l, displaystyle, lim, t, to, t, 0, f, t, l, instantaneous, velocity, can, be, defined, as, the, limit, of, the, average, velocity, as, the, time, interval, shrinks, to, zero, d, s, d, t, lim, t, 0, s, t, t, s, t, t, displaystyle, frac, ds, dt, lim, delta, t, to, 0, frac, s, t, delta, t, s, t, delta, t, acceleration, is, to, velocity, as, velocity, is, to, position, it, is, the, derivative, of, the, velocity, with, respect, to, time, acceleration, can, likewise, be, defined, as, a, limit, a, d, v, d, t, lim, t, 0, v, t, t, v, t, t, displaystyle, a, frac, dv, dt, lim, delta, t, to, 0, frac, v, t, delta, t, v, t, delta, t, consequently, the, acceleration, is, the, second, derivative, of, position, often, written, d, 2, s, d, t, 2, displaystyle, frac, d, 2, s, dt, 2, position, when, thought, of, as, a, displacement, from, an, origin, point, is, a, vector, a, quantity, with, both, magnitude, and, direction, 1, velocity, and, acceleration, are, vector, quantities, as, well, the, mathematical, tools, of, vector, algebra, provide, the, means, to, describe, motion, in, two, three, or, more, dimensions, vectors, are, often, denoted, with, an, arrow, as, in, s, displaystyle, mathbf, s, or, in, bold, typeface, such, as, s, displaystyle, bf, s, often, vectors, are, represented, visually, as, arrows, with, the, direction, of, the, vector, being, the, direction, of, the, arrow, and, the, magnitude, of, the, vector, indicated, by, the, length, of, the, arrow, numerically, a, vector, can, be, represented, as, a, list, for, example, a, body, s, velocity, vector, might, be, v, 3, m, s, 4, m, s, displaystyle, mathbf, v, mathrm, 3, m, s, mathrm, 4, m, s, indicating, that, it, is, moving, at, 3, metres, per, second, along, the, horizontal, axis, and, 4, metres, per, second, along, the, vertical, axis, the, same, motion, described, in, a, different, coordinate, system, will, be, represented, by, different, numbers, and, vector, algebra, can, be, used, to, translate, between, these, alternatives, 4, the, study, of, mechanics, is, complicated, by, the, fact, that, household, words, like, energy, are, used, with, a, technical, meaning, moreover, words, which, are, synonymous, in, everyday, speech, are, not, so, in, physics, force, is, not, the, same, as, power, or, pressure, for, example, and, mass, has, a, different, meaning, than, weight, 150, the, physics, concept, of, force, makes, quantitative, the, everyday, idea, of, a, push, or, a, pull, forces, in, newtonian, mechanics, are, often, due, to, strings, and, ropes, friction, muscle, effort, gravity, and, so, forth, like, displacement, velocity, and, acceleration, force, is, a, vector, quantity, translated, from, latin, newton, s, first, law, reads, newton, s, first, law, expresses, the, principle, of, inertia, the, natural, behavior, of, a, body, is, to, move, in, a, straight, line, at, constant, speed, a, body, s, motion, preserves, the, status, quo, but, external, forces, can, perturb, this, the, modern, understanding, of, newton, s, first, law, is, that, no, inertial, observer, is, privileged, over, any, other, the, concept, of, an, inertial, observer, makes, quantitative, the, everyday, idea, of, feeling, no, effects, of, motion, for, example, a, person, standing, on, the, ground, watching, a, train, go, past, is, an, inertial, observer, if, the, observer, on, the, ground, sees, the, train, moving, smoothly, in, a, straight, line, at, a, constant, speed, then, a, passenger, sitting, on, the, train, will, also, be, an, inertial, observer, the, train, passenger, feels, no, motion, the, principle, expressed, by, newton, s, first, law, is, that, there, is, no, way, to, say, which, inertial, observer, is, really, moving, and, which, is, really, standing, still, one, observer, s, state, of, rest, is, another, observer, s, state, of, uniform, motion, in, a, straight, line, and, no, experiment, can, deem, either, point, of, view, to, be, correct, or, incorrect, there, is, no, absolute, standard, of, rest, 62, 63, 7, 9, newton, himself, believed, that, absolute, space, and, time, existed, but, that, the, only, measures, of, space, or, time, accessible, to, experiment, are, relative, by, motion, newton, meant, the, quantity, now, called, momentum, which, depends, upon, the, amount, of, matter, contained, in, a, body, the, speed, at, which, that, body, is, moving, and, the, direction, in, which, it, is, moving, in, modern, notation, the, momentum, of, a, body, is, the, product, of, its, mass, and, its, velocity, p, m, v, displaystyle, mathbf, p, m, mathbf, v, where, all, three, quantities, can, change, over, time, newton, s, second, law, in, modern, form, states, that, the, time, derivative, of, the, momentum, is, the, force, f, d, p, d, t, displaystyle, mathbf, f, frac, d, mathbf, p, dt, if, the, mass, m, displaystyle, m, does, not, change, with, time, then, the, derivative, acts, only, upon, the, velocity, and, so, the, force, equals, the, product, of, the, mass, and, the, time, derivative, of, the, velocity, which, is, the, acceleration, f, m, d, v, d, t, m, a, displaystyle, mathbf, f, m, frac, d, mathbf, v, dt, m, mathbf, a, as, the, acceleration, is, the, second, derivative, of, position, with, respect, to, time, this, can, also, be, written, f, m, d, 2, s, d, t, 2, displaystyle, mathbf, f, m, frac, d, 2, mathbf, s, dt, 2, the, forces, acting, on, a, body, add, as, vectors, and, so, the, total, force, on, a, body, depends, upon, both, the, magnitudes, and, the, directions, of, the, individual, forces, when, the, net, force, on, a, body, is, equal, to, zero, then, by, newton, s, second, law, the, body, does, not, accelerate, and, it, is, said, to, be, in, mechanical, equilibrium, a, state, of, mechanical, equilibrium, is, stable, if, when, the, position, of, the, body, is, changed, slightly, the, body, remains, near, that, equilibrium, otherwise, the, equilibrium, is, unstable, a, common, visual, representation, of, forces, acting, in, concert, is, the, free, body, diagram, which, schematically, portrays, a, body, of, interest, and, the, forces, applied, to, it, by, outside, influences, for, example, a, free, body, diagram, of, a, block, sitting, upon, an, inclined, plane, can, illustrate, the, combination, of, gravitational, force, normal, force, friction, and, string, tension, newton, s, second, law, is, sometimes, presented, as, a, definition, of, force, i, e, a, force, is, that, which, exists, when, an, inertial, observer, sees, a, body, accelerating, in, order, for, this, to, be, more, than, a, tautology, acceleration, implies, force, force, implies, acceleration, some, other, statement, about, force, must, also, be, made, for, example, an, equation, detailing, the, force, might, be, specified, like, newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, by, inserting, such, an, expression, for, f, displaystyle, mathbf, f, into, newton, s, second, law, an, equation, with, predictive, power, can, be, written, newton, s, second, law, has, also, been, regarded, as, setting, out, a, research, program, for, physics, establishing, that, important, goals, of, the, subject, are, to, identify, the, forces, present, in, nature, and, to, catalogue, the, constituents, of, matter, 134, 12, 2, overly, brief, paraphrases, of, the, third, law, like, action, equals, reaction, might, have, caused, confusion, among, generations, of, students, the, action, and, reaction, apply, to, different, bodies, for, example, consider, a, book, at, rest, on, a, table, the, earth, s, gravity, pulls, down, upon, the, book, the, reaction, to, that, action, is, not, the, support, force, from, the, table, holding, up, the, book, but, the, gravitational, pull, of, the, book, acting, on, the, earth, newton, s, third, law, relates, to, a, more, fundamental, principle, the, conservation, of, momentum, the, latter, remains, true, even, in, cases, where, newton, s, statement, does, not, for, instance, when, force, fields, as, well, as, material, bodies, carry, momentum, and, when, momentum, is, defined, properly, in, quantum, mechanics, as, well, in, newtonian, mechanics, if, two, bodies, have, momenta, p, 1, displaystyle, mathbf, p, 1, and, p, 2, displaystyle, mathbf, p, 2, respectively, then, the, total, momentum, of, the, pair, is, p, p, 1, p, 2, displaystyle, mathbf, p, mathbf, p, 1, mathbf, p, 2, and, the, rate, of, change, of, p, displaystyle, mathbf, p, is, d, p, d, t, d, p, 1, d, t, d, p, 2, d, t, displaystyle, frac, d, mathbf, p, dt, frac, d, mathbf, p, 1, dt, frac, d, mathbf, p, 2, dt, by, newton, s, second, law, the, first, term, is, the, total, force, upon, the, first, body, and, the, second, term, is, the, total, force, upon, the, second, body, if, the, two, bodies, are, isolated, from, outside, influences, the, only, force, upon, the, first, body, can, be, that, from, the, second, and, vice, versa, by, newton, s, third, law, these, forces, have, equal, magnitude, but, opposite, direction, so, they, cancel, when, added, and, p, displaystyle, mathbf, p, is, constant, alternatively, if, p, displaystyle, mathbf, p, is, known, to, be, constant, it, follows, that, the, forces, have, equal, magnitude, and, opposite, direction, various, sources, have, proposed, elevating, other, ideas, used, in, classical, mechanics, to, the, status, of, newton, s, laws, for, example, in, newtonian, mechanics, the, total, mass, of, a, body, made, by, bringing, together, two, smaller, bodies, is, the, sum, of, their, individual, masses, frank, wilczek, has, suggested, calling, attention, to, this, assumption, by, designating, it, newton, s, zeroth, law, another, candidate, for, a, zeroth, law, is, the, fact, that, at, any, instant, a, body, reacts, to, the, forces, applied, to, it, at, that, instant, likewise, the, idea, that, forces, add, like, vectors, or, in, other, words, obey, the, superposition, principle, and, the, idea, that, forces, change, the, energy, of, a, body, have, both, been, described, as, a, fourth, law, the, study, of, the, behavior, of, massive, bodies, using, newton, s, laws, is, known, as, newtonian, mechanics, some, example, problems, in, newtonian, mechanics, are, particularly, noteworthy, for, conceptual, or, historical, reasons, if, a, body, falls, from, rest, near, the, surface, of, the, earth, then, in, the, absence, of, air, resistance, it, will, accelerate, at, a, constant, rate, this, is, known, as, free, fall, the, speed, attained, during, free, fall, is, proportional, to, the, elapsed, time, and, the, distance, traveled, is, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, elapsed, time, importantly, the, acceleration, is, the, same, for, all, bodies, independently, of, their, mass, this, follows, from, combining, newton, s, second, law, of, motion, with, his, law, of, universal, gravitation, the, latter, states, that, the, magnitude, of, the, gravitational, force, from, the, earth, upon, the, body, is, f, g, m, m, r, 2, displaystyle, f, frac, gmm, r, 2, where, m, displaystyle, m, is, the, mass, of, the, falling, body, m, displaystyle, m, is, the, mass, of, the, earth, g, displaystyle, g, is, newton, s, constant, and, r, displaystyle, r, is, the, distance, from, the, center, of, the, earth, to, the, body, s, location, which, is, very, nearly, the, radius, of, the, earth, setting, this, equal, to, m, a, displaystyle, ma, the, body, s, mass, m, displaystyle, m, cancels, from, both, sides, of, the, equation, leaving, an, acceleration, that, depends, upon, g, displaystyle, g, m, displaystyle, m, and, r, displaystyle, r, and, r, displaystyle, r, can, be, taken, to, be, constant, this, particular, value, of, acceleration, is, typically, denoted, g, displaystyle, g, g, g, m, r, 2, 9, 8, m, s, 2, displaystyle, g, frac, gm, r, 2, approx, mathrm, 9, 8, m, s, 2, if, the, body, is, not, released, from, rest, but, instead, launched, upwards, and, or, horizontally, with, nonzero, velocity, then, free, fall, becomes, projectile, motion, when, air, resistance, can, be, neglected, projectiles, follow, parabola, shaped, trajectories, because, gravity, affects, the, body, s, vertical, motion, and, not, its, horizontal, at, the, peak, of, the, projectile, s, trajectory, its, vertical, velocity, is, zero, but, its, acceleration, is, g, displaystyle, g, downwards, as, it, is, at, all, times, setting, the, wrong, vector, equal, to, zero, is, a, common, confusion, among, physics, students, when, a, body, is, in, uniform, circular, motion, the, force, on, it, changes, the, direction, of, its, motion, but, not, its, speed, for, a, body, moving, in, a, circle, of, radius, r, displaystyle, r, at, a, constant, speed, v, displaystyle, v, its, acceleration, has, a, magnitude, a, v, 2, r, displaystyle, a, frac, v, 2, r, and, is, directed, toward, the, center, of, the, circle, the, force, required, to, sustain, this, acceleration, called, the, centripetal, force, is, therefore, also, directed, toward, the, center, of, the, circle, and, has, magnitude, m, v, 2, r, displaystyle, mv, 2, r, many, orbits, such, as, that, of, the, moon, around, the, earth, can, be, approximated, by, uniform, circular, motion, in, such, cases, the, centripetal, force, is, gravity, and, by, newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, has, magnitude, g, m, m, r, 2, displaystyle, gmm, r, 2, where, m, displaystyle, m, is, the, mass, of, the, larger, body, being, orbited, therefore, the, mass, of, a, body, can, be, calculated, from, observations, of, another, body, orbiting, around, it, 130, newton, s, cannonball, is, a, thought, experiment, that, interpolates, between, projectile, motion, and, uniform, circular, motion, a, cannonball, that, is, lobbed, weakly, off, the, edge, of, a, tall, cliff, will, hit, the, ground, in, the, same, amount, of, time, as, if, it, were, dropped, from, rest, because, the, force, of, gravity, only, affects, the, cannonball, s, momentum, in, the, downward, direction, and, its, effect, is, not, diminished, by, horizontal, movement, if, the, cannonball, is, launched, with, a, greater, initial, horizontal, velocity, then, it, will, travel, farther, before, it, hits, the, ground, but, it, will, still, hit, the, ground, in, the, same, amount, of, time, however, if, the, cannonball, is, launched, with, an, even, larger, initial, velocity, then, the, curvature, of, the, earth, becomes, significant, the, ground, itself, will, curve, away, from, the, falling, cannonball, a, very, fast, cannonball, will, fall, away, from, the, inertial, straight, line, trajectory, at, the, same, rate, that, the, earth, curves, away, beneath, it, in, other, words, it, will, be, in, orbit, imagining, that, it, is, not, slowed, by, air, resistance, or, obstacles, consider, a, body, of, mass, m, displaystyle, m, able, to, move, along, the, x, displaystyle, x, axis, and, suppose, an, equilibrium, point, exists, at, the, position, x, 0, displaystyle, x, 0, that, is, at, x, 0, displaystyle, x, 0, the, net, force, upon, the, body, is, the, zero, vector, and, by, newton, s, second, law, the, body, will, not, accelerate, if, the, force, upon, the, body, is, proportional, to, the, displacement, from, the, equilibrium, point, and, directed, to, the, equilibrium, point, then, the, body, will, perform, simple, harmonic, motion, writing, the, force, as, f, k, x, displaystyle, f, kx, newton, s, second, law, becomes, m, d, 2, x, d, t, 2, k, x, displaystyle, m, frac, d, 2, x, dt, 2, kx, this, differential, equation, has, the, solution, x, t, a, cos, t, b, sin, t, displaystyle, x, t, a, cos, omega, t, b, sin, omega, t, where, the, frequency, displaystyle, omega, is, equal, to, k, m, displaystyle, sqrt, k, m, and, the, constants, a, displaystyle, a, and, b, displaystyle, b, can, be, calculated, knowing, for, example, the, position, and, velocity, the, body, has, at, a, given, time, like, t, 0, displaystyle, t, 0, one, reason, that, the, harmonic, oscillator, is, a, conceptually, important, example, is, that, it, is, good, approximation, for, many, systems, near, a, stable, mechanical, equilibrium, for, example, a, pendulum, has, a, stable, equilibrium, in, the, vertical, position, if, motionless, there, it, will, remain, there, and, if, pushed, slightly, it, will, swing, back, and, forth, neglecting, air, resistance, and, friction, in, the, pivot, the, force, upon, the, pendulum, is, gravity, and, newton, s, second, law, becomes, d, 2, d, t, 2, g, l, sin, displaystyle, frac, d, 2, theta, dt, 2, frac, g, l, sin, theta, where, l, displaystyle, l, is, the, length, of, the, pendulum, and, displaystyle, theta, is, its, angle, from, the, vertical, when, the, angle, displaystyle, theta, is, small, the, sine, of, displaystyle, theta, is, nearly, equal, to, displaystyle, theta, see, taylor, series, and, so, this, expression, simplifies, to, the, equation, for, a, simple, harmonic, oscillator, with, frequency, g, l, displaystyle, omega, sqrt, g, l, a, harmonic, oscillator, can, be, damped, often, by, friction, or, viscous, drag, in, which, case, energy, bleeds, out, of, the, oscillator, and, the, amplitude, of, the, oscillations, decreases, over, time, also, a, harmonic, oscillator, can, be, driven, by, an, applied, force, which, can, lead, to, the, phenomenon, of, resonance, newtonian, physics, treats, matter, as, being, neither, created, nor, destroyed, though, it, may, be, rearranged, it, can, be, the, case, that, an, object, of, interest, gains, or, loses, mass, because, matter, is, added, to, or, removed, from, it, in, such, a, situation, newton, s, laws, can, be, applied, to, the, individual, pieces, of, matter, keeping, track, of, which, pieces, belong, to, the, object, of, interest, over, time, for, instance, if, a, rocket, of, mass, m, t, displaystyle, m, t, moving, at, velocity, v, t, displaystyle, mathbf, v, t, ejects, matter, at, a, velocity, u, displaystyle, mathbf, u, relative, to, the, rocket, then, f, m, d, v, d, t, u, d, m, d, t, displaystyle, mathbf, f, m, frac, d, mathbf, v, dt, mathbf, u, frac, dm, dt, where, f, displaystyle, mathbf, f, is, the, net, external, force, e, g, a, planet, s, gravitational, pull, 139, physicists, developed, the, concept, of, energy, after, newton, s, time, but, it, has, become, an, inseparable, part, of, what, is, considered, newtonian, physics, energy, can, broadly, be, classified, into, kinetic, due, to, a, body, s, motion, and, potential, due, to, a, body, s, position, relative, to, others, thermal, energy, the, energy, carried, by, heat, flow, is, a, type, of, kinetic, energy, not, associated, with, the, macroscopic, motion, of, objects, but, instead, with, the, movements, of, the, atoms, and, molecules, of, which, they, are, made, according, to, the, work, energy, theorem, when, a, force, acts, upon, a, body, while, that, body, moves, along, the, line, of, the, force, the, force, does, work, upon, the, body, and, the, amount, of, work, done, is, equal, to, the, change, in, the, body, s, kinetic, energy, in, many, cases, of, interest, the, net, work, done, by, a, force, when, a, body, moves, in, a, closed, loop, starting, at, a, point, moving, along, some, trajectory, and, returning, to, the, initial, point, is, zero, if, this, is, the, case, then, the, force, can, be, written, in, terms, of, the, gradient, of, a, function, called, a, scalar, potential, 303, f, u, displaystyle, mathbf, f, mathbf, nabla, u, this, is, true, for, many, forces, including, that, of, gravity, but, not, for, friction, indeed, almost, any, problem, in, a, mechanics, textbook, that, does, not, involve, friction, can, be, expressed, in, this, way, 19, the, fact, that, the, force, can, be, written, in, this, way, can, be, understood, from, the, conservation, of, energy, without, friction, to, dissipate, a, body, s, energy, into, heat, the, body, s, energy, will, trade, between, potential, and, non, thermal, kinetic, forms, while, the, total, amount, remains, constant, any, gain, of, kinetic, energy, which, occurs, when, the, net, force, on, the, body, accelerates, it, to, a, higher, speed, must, be, accompanied, by, a, loss, of, potential, energy, so, the, net, force, upon, the, body, is, determined, by, the, manner, in, which, the, potential, energy, decreases, a, rigid, body, is, an, object, whose, size, is, too, large, to, neglect, and, which, maintains, the, same, shape, over, time, in, newtonian, mechanics, the, motion, of, a, rigid, body, is, often, understood, by, separating, it, into, movement, of, the, body, s, center, of, mass, and, movement, around, the, center, of, mass, significant, aspects, of, the, motion, of, an, extended, body, can, be, understood, by, imagining, the, mass, of, that, body, concentrated, to, a, single, point, known, as, the, center, of, mass, the, location, of, a, body, s, center, of, mass, depends, upon, how, that, body, s, material, is, distributed, for, a, collection, of, pointlike, objects, with, masses, m, 1, m, n, displaystyle, m, 1, ldots, m, n, at, positions, r, 1, r, n, displaystyle, mathbf, r, 1, ldots, mathbf, r, n, the, center, of, mass, is, located, at, r, i, 1, n, m, i, r, i, m, displaystyle, mathbf, r, sum, i, 1, n, frac, m, i, mathbf, r, i, m, where, m, displaystyle, m, is, the, total, mass, of, the, collection, in, the, absence, of, a, net, external, force, the, center, of, mass, moves, at, a, constant, speed, in, a, straight, line, this, applies, for, example, to, a, collision, between, two, bodies, if, the, total, external, force, is, not, zero, then, the, center, of, mass, changes, velocity, as, though, it, were, a, point, body, of, mass, m, displaystyle, m, this, follows, from, the, fact, that, the, internal, forces, within, the, collection, the, forces, that, the, objects, exert, upon, each, other, occur, in, balanced, pairs, by, newton, s, third, law, in, a, system, of, two, bodies, with, one, much, more, massive, than, the, other, the, center, of, mass, will, approximately, coincide, with, the, location, of, the, more, massive, body, 22, 24, when, newton, s, laws, are, applied, to, rotating, extended, bodies, they, lead, to, new, quantities, that, are, analogous, to, those, invoked, in, the, original, laws, the, analogue, of, mass, is, the, moment, of, inertia, the, counterpart, of, momentum, is, angular, momentum, and, the, counterpart, of, force, is, torque, angular, momentum, is, calculated, with, respect, to, a, reference, point, if, the, displacement, vector, from, a, reference, point, to, a, body, is, r, displaystyle, mathbf, r, and, the, body, has, momentum, p, displaystyle, mathbf, p, then, the, body, s, angular, momentum, with, respect, to, that, point, is, using, the, vector, cross, product, l, r, p, displaystyle, mathbf, l, mathbf, r, times, mathbf, p, taking, the, time, derivative, of, the, angular, momentum, gives, d, l, d, t, d, r, d, t, p, r, d, p, d, t, v, m, v, r, f, displaystyle, frac, d, mathbf, l, dt, left, frac, d, mathbf, r, dt, right, times, mathbf, p, mathbf, r, times, frac, d, mathbf, p, dt, mathbf, v, times, m, mathbf, v, mathbf, r, times, mathbf, f, the, first, term, vanishes, because, v, displaystyle, mathbf, v, and, m, v, displaystyle, m, mathbf, v, point, in, the, same, direction, the, remaining, term, is, the, torque, r, f, displaystyle, mathbf, tau, mathbf, r, times, mathbf, f, when, the, torque, is, zero, the, angular, momentum, is, constant, just, as, when, the, force, is, zero, the, momentum, is, constant, 14, 15, the, torque, can, vanish, even, when, the, force, is, non, zero, if, the, body, is, located, at, the, reference, point, r, 0, displaystyle, mathbf, r, 0, or, if, the, force, f, displaystyle, mathbf, f, and, the, displacement, vector, r, displaystyle, mathbf, r, are, directed, along, the, same, line, the, angular, momentum, of, a, collection, of, point, masses, and, thus, of, an, extended, body, is, found, by, adding, the, contributions, from, each, of, the, points, this, provides, a, means, to, characterize, a, body, s, rotation, about, an, axis, by, adding, up, the, angular, momenta, of, its, individual, pieces, the, result, depends, on, the, chosen, axis, the, shape, of, the, body, and, the, rate, of, rotation, 28, newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, states, that, any, body, attracts, any, other, body, along, the, straight, line, connecting, them, the, size, of, the, attracting, force, is, proportional, to, the, product, of, their, masses, and, inversely, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, distance, between, them, finding, the, shape, of, the, orbits, that, an, inverse, square, force, law, will, produce, is, known, as, the, kepler, problem, the, kepler, problem, can, be, solved, in, multiple, ways, including, by, demonstrating, that, the, laplace, runge, lenz, vector, is, constant, or, by, applying, a, duality, transformation, to, a, 2, dimensional, harmonic, oscillator, however, it, is, solved, the, result, is, that, orbits, will, be, conic, sections, that, is, ellipses, including, circles, parabolas, or, hyperbolas, the, eccentricity, of, the, orbit, and, thus, the, type, of, conic, section, is, determined, by, the, energy, and, the, angular, momentum, of, the, orbiting, body, planets, do, not, have, sufficient, energy, to, escape, the, sun, and, so, their, orbits, are, ellipses, to, a, good, approximation, because, the, planets, pull, on, one, another, actual, orbits, are, not, exactly, conic, sections, if, a, third, mass, is, added, the, kepler, problem, becomes, the, three, body, problem, which, in, general, has, no, exact, solution, in, closed, form, that, is, there, is, no, way, to, start, from, the, differential, equations, implied, by, newton, s, laws, and, after, a, finite, sequence, of, standard, mathematical, operations, obtain, equations, that, express, the, three, bodies, motions, over, time, numerical, methods, can, be, applied, to, obtain, useful, albeit, approximate, results, for, the, three, body, problem, the, positions, and, velocities, of, the, bodies, can, be, stored, in, variables, within, a, computer, s, memory, newton, s, laws, are, used, to, calculate, how, the, velocities, will, change, over, a, short, interval, of, time, and, knowing, the, velocities, the, changes, of, position, over, that, time, interval, can, be, computed, this, process, is, looped, to, calculate, approximately, the, bodies, trajectories, generally, speaking, the, shorter, the, time, interval, the, more, accurate, the, approximation, newton, s, laws, of, motion, allow, the, possibility, of, chaos, that, is, qualitatively, speaking, physical, systems, obeying, newton, s, laws, can, exhibit, sensitive, dependence, upon, their, initial, conditions, a, slight, change, of, the, position, or, velocity, of, one, part, of, a, system, can, lead, to, the, whole, system, behaving, in, a, radically, different, way, within, a, short, time, noteworthy, examples, include, the, three, body, problem, the, double, pendulum, dynamical, billiards, and, the, fermi, pasta, ulam, tsingou, problem, newton, s, laws, can, be, applied, to, fluids, by, considering, a, fluid, as, composed, of, infinitesimal, pieces, each, exerting, forces, upon, neighboring, pieces, the, euler, momentum, equation, is, an, expression, of, newton, s, second, law, adapted, to, fluid, dynamics, a, fluid, is, described, by, a, velocity, field, i, e, a, function, v, x, t, displaystyle, mathbf, v, mathbf, x, t, that, assigns, a, velocity, vector, to, each, point, in, space, and, time, a, small, object, being, carried, along, by, the, fluid, flow, can, change, velocity, for, two, reasons, first, because, the, velocity, field, at, its, position, is, changing, over, time, and, second, because, it, moves, to, a, new, location, where, the, velocity, field, has, a, different, value, consequently, when, newton, s, second, law, is, applied, to, an, infinitesimal, portion, of, fluid, the, acceleration, a, displaystyle, mathbf, a, has, two, terms, a, combination, known, as, a, total, or, material, derivative, the, mass, of, an, infinitesimal, portion, depends, upon, the, fluid, density, and, there, is, a, net, force, upon, it, if, the, fluid, pressure, varies, from, one, side, of, it, to, another, accordingly, a, f, m, displaystyle, mathbf, a, mathbf, f, m, becomes, v, t, v, v, 1, p, f, displaystyle, frac, partial, v, partial, t, mathbf, nabla, cdot, mathbf, v, mathbf, v, frac, 1, rho, mathbf, nabla, p, mathbf, f, where, displaystyle, rho, is, the, density, p, displaystyle, p, is, the, pressure, and, f, displaystyle, mathbf, f, stands, for, an, external, influence, like, a, gravitational, pull, incorporating, the, effect, of, viscosity, turns, the, euler, equation, into, a, navier, stokes, equation, v, t, v, v, 1, p, 2, v, f, displaystyle, frac, partial, v, partial, t, mathbf, nabla, cdot, mathbf, v, mathbf, v, frac, 1, rho, mathbf, nabla, p, nu, nabla, 2, mathbf, v, mathbf, f, where, displaystyle, nu, is, the, kinematic, viscosity, it, is, mathematically, possible, for, a, collection, of, point, masses, moving, in, accord, with, newton, s, laws, to, launch, some, of, themselves, away, so, forcefully, that, they, fly, off, to, infinity, in, a, finite, time, this, unphysical, behavior, known, as, a, noncollision, singularity, depends, upon, the, masses, being, pointlike, and, able, to, approach, one, another, arbitrarily, closely, as, well, as, the, lack, of, a, relativistic, speed, limit, in, newtonian, physics, it, is, not, yet, known, whether, or, not, the, euler, and, navier, stokes, equations, exhibit, the, analogous, behavior, of, initially, smooth, solutions, blowing, up, in, finite, time, the, question, of, existence, and, smoothness, of, navier, stokes, solutions, is, one, of, the, millennium, prize, problems, classical, mechanics, can, be, mathematically, formulated, in, multiple, different, ways, other, than, the, newtonian, description, which, itself, of, course, incorporates, contributions, from, others, both, before, and, after, newton, the, physical, content, of, these, different, formulations, is, the, same, as, the, newtonian, but, they, provide, different, insights, and, facilitate, different, types, of, calculations, for, example, lagrangian, mechanics, helps, make, apparent, the, connection, between, symmetries, and, conservation, laws, and, it, is, useful, when, calculating, the, motion, of, constrained, bodies, like, a, mass, restricted, to, move, along, a, curving, track, or, on, the, surface, of, a, sphere, 48, hamiltonian, mechanics, is, convenient, for, statistical, physics, 57, leads, to, further, insight, about, symmetry, 251, and, can, be, developed, into, sophisticated, techniques, for, perturbation, theory, 284, due, to, the, breadth, of, these, topics, the, discussion, here, will, be, confined, to, concise, treatments, of, how, they, reformulate, newton, s, laws, of, motion, lagrangian, mechanics, differs, from, the, newtonian, formulation, by, considering, entire, trajectories, at, once, rather, than, predicting, a, body, s, motion, at, a, single, instant, 109, it, is, traditional, in, lagrangian, mechanics, to, denote, position, with, q, displaystyle, q, and, velocity, with, q, displaystyle, dot, q, the, simplest, example, is, a, massive, point, particle, the, lagrangian, for, which, can, be, written, as, the, difference, between, its, kinetic, and, potential, energies, l, q, q, t, v, displaystyle, l, q, dot, q, t, v, where, the, kinetic, energy, is, t, 1, 2, m, q, 2, displaystyle, t, frac, 1, 2, m, dot, q, 2, and, the, potential, energy, is, some, function, of, the, position, v, q, displaystyle, v, q, the, physical, path, that, the, particle, will, take, between, an, initial, point, q, i, displaystyle, q, i, and, a, final, point, q, f, displaystyle, q, f, is, the, path, for, which, the, integral, of, the, lagrangian, is, stationary, that, is, the, physical, path, has, the, property, that, small, perturbations, of, it, will, to, a, first, approximation, not, change, the, integral, of, the, lagrangian, calculus, of, variations, provides, the, mathematical, tools, for, finding, this, path, 485, applying, the, calculus, of, variations, to, the, task, of, finding, the, path, yields, the, euler, lagrange, equation, for, the, particle, d, d, t, l, q, l, q, displaystyle, frac, d, dt, left, frac, partial, l, partial, dot, q, right, frac, partial, l, partial, q, evaluating, the, partial, derivatives, of, the, lagrangian, gives, d, d, t, m, q, d, v, d, q, displaystyle, frac, d, dt, m, dot, q, frac, dv, dq, which, is, a, restatement, of, newton, s, second, law, the, left, hand, side, is, the, time, derivative, of, the, momentum, and, the, right, hand, side, is, the, force, represented, in, terms, of, the, potential, energy, 737, landau, and, lifshitz, argue, that, the, lagrangian, formulation, makes, the, conceptual, content, of, classical, mechanics, more, clear, than, starting, with, newton, s, laws, lagrangian, mechanics, provides, a, convenient, framework, in, which, to, prove, noether, s, theorem, which, relates, symmetries, and, conservation, laws, the, conservation, of, momentum, can, be, derived, by, applying, noether, s, theorem, to, a, lagrangian, for, a, multi, particle, system, and, so, newton, s, third, law, is, a, theorem, rather, than, an, assumption, 124, in, hamiltonian, mechanics, the, dynamics, of, a, system, are, represented, by, a, function, called, the, hamiltonian, which, in, many, cases, of, interest, is, equal, to, the, total, energy, of, the, system, 742, the, hamiltonian, is, a, function, of, the, positions, and, the, momenta, of, all, the, bodies, making, up, the, system, and, it, may, also, depend, explicitly, upon, time, the, time, derivatives, of, the, position, and, momentum, variables, are, given, by, partial, derivatives, of, the, hamiltonian, via, hamilton, s, equations, 203, the, simplest, example, is, a, point, mass, m, displaystyle, m, constrained, to, move, in, a, straight, line, under, the, effect, of, a, potential, writing, q, displaystyle, q, for, the, position, coordinate, and, p, displaystyle, p, for, the, body, s, momentum, the, hamiltonian, is, h, p, q, p, 2, 2, m, v, q, displaystyle, mathcal, h, p, q, frac, p, 2, 2m, v, q, in, this, example, hamilton, s, equations, are, d, q, d, t, h, p, displaystyle, frac, dq, dt, frac, partial, mathcal, h, partial, p, and, d, p, d, t, h, q, displaystyle, frac, dp, dt, frac, partial, mathcal, h, partial, q, evaluating, these, partial, derivatives, the, former, equation, becomes, d, q, d, t, p, m, displaystyle, frac, dq, dt, frac, p, m, which, reproduces, the, familiar, statement, that, a, body, s, momentum, is, the, product, of, its, mass, and, velocity, the, time, derivative, of, the, momentum, is, d, p, d, t, d, v, d, q, displaystyle, frac, dp, dt, frac, dv, dq, which, upon, identifying, the, negative, derivative, of, the, potential, with, the, force, is, just, newton, s, second, law, once, again, 742, as, in, the, lagrangian, formulation, in, hamiltonian, mechanics, the, conservation, of, momentum, can, be, derived, using, noether, s, theorem, making, newton, s, third, law, an, idea, that, is, deduced, rather, than, assumed, 251, among, the, proposals, to, reform, the, standard, introductory, physics, curriculum, is, one, that, teaches, the, concept, of, energy, before, that, of, force, essentially, introductory, hamiltonian, mechanics, the, hamilton, jacobi, equation, provides, yet, another, formulation, of, classical, mechanics, one, which, makes, it, mathematically, analogous, to, wave, optics, 284, this, formulation, also, uses, hamiltonian, functions, but, in, a, different, way, than, the, formulation, described, above, the, paths, taken, by, bodies, or, collections, of, bodies, are, deduced, from, a, function, s, q, 1, q, 2, t, displaystyle, s, mathbf, q, 1, mathbf, q, 2, ldots, t, of, positions, q, i, displaystyle, mathbf, q, i, and, time, t, displaystyle, t, the, hamiltonian, is, incorporated, into, the, hamilton, jacobi, equation, a, differential, equation, for, s, displaystyle, s, bodies, move, over, time, in, such, a, way, that, their, trajectories, are, perpendicular, to, the, surfaces, of, constant, s, displaystyle, s, analogously, to, how, a, light, ray, propagates, in, the, direction, perpendicular, to, its, wavefront, this, is, simplest, to, express, for, the, case, of, a, single, point, mass, in, which, s, displaystyle, s, is, a, function, s, q, t, displaystyle, s, mathbf, q, t, and, the, point, mass, moves, in, the, direction, along, which, s, displaystyle, s, changes, most, steeply, in, other, words, the, momentum, of, the, point, mass, is, the, gradient, of, s, displaystyle, s, v, 1, m, s, displaystyle, mathbf, v, frac, 1, m, mathbf, nabla, s, the, hamilton, jacobi, equation, for, a, point, mass, is, s, t, h, q, s, t, displaystyle, frac, partial, s, partial, t, h, left, mathbf, q, mathbf, nabla, s, t, right, the, relation, to, newton, s, laws, can, be, seen, by, considering, a, point, mass, moving, in, a, time, independent, potential, v, q, displaystyle, v, mathbf, q, in, which, case, the, hamilton, jacobi, equation, becomes, s, t, 1, 2, m, s, 2, v, q, displaystyle, frac, partial, s, partial, t, frac, 1, 2m, left, mathbf, nabla, s, right, 2, v, mathbf, q, taking, the, gradient, of, both, sides, this, becomes, s, t, 1, 2, m, s, 2, v, displaystyle, mathbf, nabla, frac, partial, s, partial, t, frac, 1, 2m, mathbf, nabla, left, mathbf, nabla, s, right, 2, mathbf, nabla, v, interchanging, the, order, of, the, partial, derivatives, on, the, left, hand, side, and, using, the, power, and, chain, rules, on, the, first, term, on, the, right, hand, side, t, s, 1, m, s, s, v, displaystyle, frac, partial, partial, t, mathbf, nabla, s, frac, 1, m, left, mathbf, nabla, s, cdot, mathbf, nabla, right, mathbf, nabla, s, mathbf, nabla, v, gathering, together, the, terms, that, depend, upon, the, gradient, of, s, displaystyle, s, t, 1, m, s, s, v, displaystyle, left, mathbf, nabla, s, mathbf, nabla, v, this, is, another, re, expression, of, newton, s, second, law, the, expression, in, brackets, is, a, total, or, material, derivative, as, mentioned, above, in, which, the, first, term, indicates, how, the, function, being, differentiated, changes, over, time, at, a, fixed, location, and, the, second, term, captures, how, a, moving, particle, will, see, different, values, of, that, function, as, it, travels, from, place, to, place, t, 1, m, s, t, v, d, d, t, displaystyle, left, left, frac, d, dt, in, statistical, physics, the, kinetic, theory, of, gases, applies, newton, s, laws, of, motion, to, large, numbers, typically, on, the, order, of, the, avogadro, number, of, particles, kinetic, theory, can, explain, for, example, the, pressure, that, a, gas, exerts, upon, the, container, holding, it, as, the, aggregate, of, many, impacts, of, atoms, each, imparting, a, tiny, amount, of, momentum, 62, the, langevin, equation, is, a, special, case, of, newton, s, second, law, adapted, for, the, case, of, describing, a, small, object, bombarded, stochastically, by, even, smaller, ones, 235, it, can, be, written, m, a, v, displaystyle, m, mathbf, a, gamma, mathbf, v, mathbf, xi, where, displaystyle, gamma, is, a, drag, coefficient, and, displaystyle, mathbf, xi, is, a, force, that, varies, randomly, from, instant, to, instant, representing, the, net, effect, of, collisions, with, the, surrounding, particles, this, is, used, to, model, brownian, motion, newton, s, three, laws, can, be, applied, to, phenomena, involving, electricity, and, magnetism, though, subtleties, and, caveats, exist, coulomb, s, law, for, the, electric, force, between, two, stationary, electrically, charged, bodies, has, much, the, same, mathematical, form, as, newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, the, force, is, proportional, to, the, product, of, the, charges, inversely, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, distance, between, them, and, directed, along, the, straight, line, between, them, the, coulomb, force, that, a, charge, q, 1, displaystyle, q, 1, exerts, upon, a, charge, q, 2, displaystyle, q, 2, is, equal, in, magnitude, to, the, force, that, q, 2, displaystyle, q, 2, exerts, upon, q, 1, displaystyle, q, 1, and, it, points, in, the, exact, opposite, direction, coulomb, s, law, is, thus, consistent, with, newton, s, third, law, electromagnetism, treats, forces, as, produced, by, fields, acting, upon, charges, the, lorentz, force, law, provides, an, expression, for, the, force, upon, a, charged, body, that, can, be, plugged, into, newton, s, second, law, in, order, to, calculate, its, acceleration, 85, according, to, the, lorentz, force, law, a, charged, body, in, an, electric, field, experiences, a, force, in, the, direction, of, that, field, a, force, proportional, to, its, charge, q, displaystyle, q, and, to, the, strength, of, the, electric, field, in, addition, a, moving, charged, body, in, a, magnetic, field, experiences, a, force, that, is, also, proportional, to, its, charge, in, a, direction, perpendicular, to, both, the, field, and, the, body, s, direction, of, motion, using, the, vector, cross, product, f, q, e, q, v, b, displaystyle, mathbf, f, q, mathbf, e, q, mathbf, v, times, mathbf, b, if, the, electric, field, vanishes, e, 0, displaystyle, mathbf, e, 0, then, the, force, will, be, perpendicular, to, the, charge, s, motion, just, as, in, the, case, of, uniform, circular, motion, studied, above, and, the, charge, will, circle, or, more, generally, move, in, a, helix, around, the, magnetic, field, lines, at, the, cyclotron, frequency, q, b, m, displaystyle, omega, qb, m, 222, mass, spectrometry, works, by, applying, electric, and, or, magnetic, fields, to, moving, charges, and, measuring, the, resulting, acceleration, which, by, the, lorentz, force, law, yields, the, mass, to, charge, ratio, collections, of, charged, bodies, do, not, always, obey, newton, s, third, law, there, can, be, a, change, of, one, body, s, momentum, without, a, compensatory, change, in, the, momentum, of, another, the, discrepancy, is, accounted, for, by, momentum, carried, by, the, electromagnetic, field, itself, the, momentum, per, unit, volume, of, the, electromagnetic, field, is, proportional, to, the, poynting, vector, 184, there, is, subtle, conceptual, conflict, between, electromagnetism, and, newton, s, first, law, maxwell, s, theory, of, electromagnetism, predicts, that, electromagnetic, waves, will, travel, through, empty, space, at, a, constant, definite, speed, thus, some, inertial, observers, seemingly, have, a, privileged, status, over, the, others, namely, those, who, measure, the, speed, of, light, and, find, it, to, be, the, value, predicted, by, the, maxwell, equations, in, other, words, light, provides, an, absolute, standard, for, speed, yet, the, principle, of, inertia, holds, that, there, should, be, no, such, standard, this, tension, is, resolved, in, the, theory, of, special, relativity, which, revises, the, notions, of, space, and, time, in, such, a, way, that, all, inertial, observers, will, agree, upon, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, in, special, relativity, the, rule, that, wilczek, called, newton, s, zeroth, law, breaks, down, the, mass, of, a, composite, object, is, not, merely, the, sum, of, the, masses, of, the, individual, pieces, 33, newton, s, first, law, inertial, motion, remains, true, a, form, of, newton, s, second, law, that, force, is, the, rate, of, change, of, momentum, also, holds, as, does, the, conservation, of, momentum, however, the, definition, of, momentum, is, modified, among, the, consequences, of, this, is, the, fact, that, the, more, quickly, a, body, moves, the, harder, it, is, to, accelerate, and, so, no, matter, how, much, force, is, applied, a, body, cannot, be, accelerated, to, the, speed, of, light, depending, on, the, problem, at, hand, momentum, in, special, relativity, can, be, represented, as, a, three, dimensional, vector, p, m, v, displaystyle, mathbf, p, m, gamma, mathbf, v, where, m, displaystyle, m, is, the, body, s, rest, mass, and, displaystyle, gamma, is, the, lorentz, factor, which, depends, upon, the, body, s, speed, alternatively, momentum, and, force, can, be, represented, as, four, vectors, 107, newton, s, third, law, must, be, modified, in, special, relativity, the, third, law, refers, to, the, forces, between, two, bodies, at, the, same, moment, in, time, and, a, key, feature, of, special, relativity, is, that, simultaneity, is, relative, events, that, happen, at, the, same, time, relative, to, one, observer, can, happen, at, different, times, relative, to, another, so, in, a, given, observer, s, frame, of, reference, action, and, reaction, may, not, be, exactly, opposite, and, the, total, momentum, of, interacting, bodies, may, not, be, conserved, the, conservation, of, momentum, is, restored, by, including, the, momentum, stored, in, the, field, that, describes, the, bodies, interaction, newtonian, mechanics, is, a, good, approximation, to, special, relativity, when, the, speeds, involved, are, small, compared, to, that, of, light, 131, general, relativity, is, a, theory, of, gravity, that, advances, beyond, that, of, newton, in, general, relativity, the, gravitational, force, of, newtonian, mechanics, is, reimagined, as, curvature, of, spacetime, a, curved, path, like, an, orbit, attributed, to, a, gravitational, force, in, newtonian, mechanics, is, not, the, result, of, a, force, deflecting, a, body, from, an, ideal, straight, line, path, but, rather, the, body, s, attempt, to, fall, freely, through, a, background, that, is, itself, curved, by, the, presence, of, other, masses, a, remark, by, john, archibald, wheeler, that, has, become, proverbial, among, physicists, summarizes, the, theory, spacetime, tells, matter, how, to, move, matter, tells, spacetime, how, to, curve, wheeler, himself, thought, of, this, reciprocal, relationship, as, a, modern, generalized, form, of, newton, s, third, law, the, relation, between, matter, distribution, and, spacetime, curvature, is, given, by, the, einstein, field, equations, which, require, tensor, calculus, to, express, 43, the, newtonian, theory, of, gravity, is, a, good, approximation, to, the, predictions, of, general, relativity, when, gravitational, effects, are, weak, and, objects, are, moving, slowly, compared, to, the, speed, of, light, 327, quantum, mechanics, is, a, theory, of, physics, originally, developed, in, order, to, understand, microscopic, phenomena, behavior, at, the, scale, of, molecules, atoms, or, subatomic, particles, generally, and, loosely, speaking, the, smaller, a, system, is, the, more, an, adequate, mathematical, model, will, require, understanding, quantum, effects, the, conceptual, underpinning, of, quantum, physics, is, very, different, from, that, of, classical, physics, instead, of, thinking, about, quantities, like, position, momentum, and, energy, as, properties, that, an, object, has, one, considers, what, result, might, appear, when, a, measurement, of, a, chosen, type, is, performed, quantum, mechanics, allows, the, physicist, to, calculate, the, probability, that, a, chosen, measurement, will, elicit, a, particular, result, the, expectation, value, for, a, measurement, is, the, average, of, the, possible, results, it, might, yield, weighted, by, their, probabilities, of, occurrence, the, ehrenfest, theorem, provides, a, connection, between, quantum, expectation, values, and, newton, s, second, law, a, connection, that, is, necessarily, inexact, as, quantum, physics, is, fundamentally, different, from, classical, in, quantum, physics, position, and, momentum, are, represented, by, mathematical, entities, known, as, hermitian, operators, and, the, born, rule, is, used, to, calculate, the, expectation, values, of, a, position, measurement, or, a, momentum, measurement, these, expectation, values, will, generally, change, over, time, that, is, depending, on, the, time, at, which, for, example, a, position, measurement, is, performed, the, probabilities, for, its, different, possible, outcomes, will, vary, the, ehrenfest, theorem, says, roughly, speaking, that, the, equations, describing, how, these, expectation, values, change, over, time, have, a, form, reminiscent, of, newton, s, second, law, however, the, more, pronounced, quantum, effects, are, in, a, given, situation, the, more, difficult, it, is, to, derive, meaningful, conclusions, from, this, resemblance, the, concepts, invoked, in, newton, s, laws, of, motion, mass, velocity, momentum, force, have, predecessors, in, earlier, work, and, the, content, of, newtonian, physics, was, further, developed, after, newton, s, time, newton, combined, knowledge, of, celestial, motions, with, the, study, of, events, on, earth, and, showed, that, one, theory, of, mechanics, could, encompass, both, the, subject, of, physics, is, often, traced, back, to, aristotle, but, the, history, of, the, concepts, involved, is, obscured, by, multiple, factors, an, exact, correspondence, between, aristotelian, and, modern, concepts, is, not, simple, to, establish, aristotle, did, not, clearly, distinguish, what, we, would, call, speed, and, force, used, the, same, term, for, density, and, viscosity, and, conceived, of, motion, as, always, through, a, medium, rather, than, through, space, in, addition, some, concepts, often, termed, aristotelian, might, better, be, attributed, to, his, followers, and, commentators, upon, him, these, commentators, found, that, aristotelian, physics, had, difficulty, explaining, projectile, motion, aristotle, divided, motion, into, two, types, natural, and, violent, the, natural, motion, of, terrestrial, solid, matter, was, to, fall, downwards, whereas, a, violent, motion, could, push, a, body, sideways, moreover, in, aristotelian, physics, a, violent, motion, requires, an, immediate, cause, separated, from, the, cause, of, its, violent, motion, a, body, would, revert, to, its, natural, behavior, yet, a, javelin, continues, moving, after, it, leaves, the, thrower, s, hand, aristotle, concluded, that, the, air, around, the, javelin, must, be, imparted, with, the, ability, to, move, the, javelin, forward, john, philoponus, a, byzantine, greek, thinker, active, during, the, sixth, century, found, this, absurd, the, same, medium, air, was, somehow, responsible, both, for, sustaining, motion, and, for, impeding, it, if, aristotle, s, idea, were, true, philoponus, said, armies, would, launch, weapons, by, blowing, upon, them, with, bellows, philoponus, argued, that, setting, a, body, into, motion, imparted, a, quality, impetus, that, would, be, contained, within, the, body, itself, as, long, as, its, impetus, was, sustained, the, body, would, continue, to, move, 47, in, the, following, centuries, versions, of, impetus, theory, were, advanced, by, individuals, including, nur, ad, din, al, bitruji, avicenna, abu, l, barak, t, al, baghd, d, john, buridan, and, albert, of, saxony, in, retrospect, the, idea, of, impetus, can, be, seen, as, a, forerunner, of, the, modern, concept, of, momentum, the, intuition, that, objects, move, according, to, some, kind, of, impetus, persists, in, many, students, of, introductory, physics, the, french, philosopher, ren, descartes, introduced, the, concept, of, inertia, by, way, of, his, laws, of, nature, in, the, world, trait, du, monde, et, de, la, lumi, re, written, 1629, 33, however, the, world, purported, a, heliocentric, worldview, and, in, 1633, this, view, had, given, rise, a, great, conflict, between, galileo, galilei, and, the, roman, catholic, inquisition, descartes, knew, about, this, controversy, and, did, not, wish, to, get, involved, the, world, was, not, published, until, 1664, ten, years, after, his, death, the, modern, concept, of, inertia, is, credited, to, galileo, based, on, his, experiments, galileo, concluded, that, the, natural, behavior, of, a, moving, body, was, to, keep, moving, until, something, else, interfered, with, it, in, two, new, sciences, 1638, galileo, wrote, imagine, any, particle, projected, along, a, horizontal, plane, without, friction, then, we, know, from, what, has, been, more, fully, explained, in, the, preceding, pages, that, this, particle, will, move, along, this, same, plane, with, a, motion, which, is, uniform, and, perpetual, provided, the, plane, has, no, limits, galileo, recognized, that, in, projectile, motion, the, earth, s, gravity, affects, vertical, but, not, horizontal, motion, however, galileo, s, idea, of, inertia, was, not, exactly, the, one, that, would, be, codified, into, newton, s, first, law, galileo, thought, that, a, body, moving, a, long, distance, inertially, would, follow, the, curve, of, the, earth, this, idea, was, corrected, by, isaac, beeckman, descartes, and, pierre, gassendi, who, recognized, that, inertial, motion, should, be, motion, in, a, straight, line, descartes, published, his, laws, of, nature, laws, of, motion, with, this, correction, in, principles, of, philosophy, principia, philosophiae, in, 1644, with, the, heliocentric, part, toned, down, first, law, of, nature, each, thing, when, left, to, itself, continues, in, the, same, state, so, any, moving, body, goes, on, moving, until, something, stops, it, second, law, of, nature, each, moving, thing, if, left, to, itself, moves, in, a, straight, line, so, any, body, moving, in, a, circle, always, tends, to, move, away, from, the, centre, of, the, circle, according, to, american, philosopher, richard, j, blackwell, dutch, scientist, christiaan, huygens, had, worked, out, his, own, concise, version, of, the, law, in, 1656, it, was, not, published, until, 1703, eight, years, after, his, death, in, the, opening, paragraph, of, de, motu, corporum, ex, percussione, hypothesis, i, any, body, already, in, motion, will, continue, to, move, perpetually, with, the, same, speed, and, in, a, straight, line, unless, it, is, impeded, according, to, huygens, this, law, was, already, known, by, galileo, and, descartes, among, others, christiaan, huygens, in, his, horologium, oscillatorium, 1673, put, forth, the, hypothesis, that, by, the, action, of, gravity, whatever, its, sources, it, happens, that, bodies, are, moved, by, a, motion, composed, both, of, a, uniform, motion, in, one, direction, or, another, and, of, a, motion, downward, due, to, gravity, newton, s, second, law, generalized, this, hypothesis, from, gravity, to, all, forces, one, important, characteristic, of, newtonian, physics, is, that, forces, can, act, at, a, distance, without, requiring, physical, contact, for, example, the, sun, and, the, earth, pull, on, each, other, gravitationally, despite, being, separated, by, millions, of, kilometres, this, contrasts, with, the, idea, championed, by, descartes, among, others, that, the, sun, s, gravity, held, planets, in, orbit, by, swirling, them, in, a, vortex, of, transparent, matter, aether, newton, considered, aetherial, explanations, of, force, but, ultimately, rejected, them, the, study, of, magnetism, by, william, gilbert, and, others, created, a, precedent, for, thinking, of, immaterial, forces, and, unable, to, find, a, quantitatively, satisfactory, explanation, of, his, law, of, gravity, in, terms, of, an, aetherial, model, newton, eventually, declared, i, feign, no, hypotheses, whether, or, not, a, model, like, descartes, s, vortices, could, be, found, to, underlie, the, principia, s, theories, of, motion, and, gravity, the, first, grounds, for, judging, them, must, be, the, successful, predictions, they, made, and, indeed, since, newton, s, time, every, attempt, at, such, a, model, has, failed, johannes, kepler, suggested, that, gravitational, attractions, were, reciprocal, that, for, example, the, moon, pulls, on, the, earth, while, the, earth, pulls, on, the, moon, but, he, did, not, argue, that, such, pairs, are, equal, and, opposite, in, his, principles, of, philosophy, 1644, descartes, introduced, the, idea, that, during, a, collision, between, bodies, a, quantity, of, motion, remains, unchanged, descartes, defined, this, quantity, somewhat, imprecisely, by, adding, up, the, products, of, the, speed, and, size, of, each, body, where, size, for, him, incorporated, both, volume, and, surface, area, moreover, descartes, thought, of, the, universe, as, a, plenum, that, is, filled, with, matter, so, all, motion, required, a, body, to, displace, a, medium, as, it, moved, during, the, 1650s, huygens, studied, collisions, between, hard, spheres, and, deduced, a, principle, that, is, now, identified, as, the, conservation, of, momentum, christopher, wren, would, later, deduce, the, same, rules, for, elastic, collisions, that, huygens, had, and, john, wallis, would, apply, momentum, conservation, to, study, inelastic, collisions, newton, cited, the, work, of, huygens, wren, and, wallis, to, support, the, validity, of, his, third, law, newton, arrived, at, his, set, of, three, laws, incrementally, in, a, 1684, manuscript, written, to, huygens, he, listed, four, laws, the, principle, of, inertia, the, change, of, motion, by, force, a, statement, about, relative, motion, that, would, today, be, called, galilean, invariance, and, the, rule, that, interactions, between, bodies, do, not, change, the, motion, of, their, center, of, mass, in, a, later, manuscript, newton, added, a, law, of, action, and, reaction, while, saying, that, this, law, and, the, law, regarding, the, center, of, mass, implied, one, another, newton, probably, settled, on, the, presentation, in, the, principia, with, three, primary, laws, and, then, other, statements, reduced, to, corollaries, during, 1685, newton, expressed, his, second, law, by, saying, that, the, force, on, a, body, is, proportional, to, its, change, of, motion, or, momentum, by, the, time, he, wrote, the, principia, he, had, already, developed, calculus, which, he, called, the, science, of, fluxions, but, in, the, principia, he, made, no, explicit, use, of, it, perhaps, because, he, believed, geometrical, arguments, in, the, tradition, of, euclid, to, be, more, rigorous, 15, consequently, the, principia, does, not, express, acceleration, as, the, second, derivative, of, position, and, so, it, does, not, give, the, second, law, as, f, m, a, displaystyle, f, ma, this, form, of, the, second, law, was, written, for, the, special, case, of, constant, force, at, least, as, early, as, 1716, by, jakob, hermann, leonhard, euler, would, employ, it, as, a, basic, premise, in, the, 1740s, euler, pioneered, the, study, of, rigid, bodies, and, established, the, basic, theory, of, fluid, dynamics, pierre, simon, laplace, s, five, volume, trait, de, m, canique, c, leste, 1798, 1825, forsook, geometry, and, developed, mechanics, purely, through, algebraic, expressions, while, resolving, questions, that, the, principia, had, left, open, like, a, full, theory, of, the, tides, the, concept, of, energy, became, a, key, part, of, newtonian, mechanics, in, the, post, newton, period, huygens, solution, of, the, collision, of, hard, spheres, showed, that, in, that, case, not, only, is, momentum, conserved, but, kinetic, energy, is, as, well, or, rather, a, quantity, that, in, retrospect, we, can, identify, as, one, half, the, total, kinetic, energy, the, question, of, what, is, conserved, during, all, other, processes, like, inelastic, collisions, and, motion, slowed, by, friction, was, not, resolved, until, the, 19th, century, debates, on, this, topic, overlapped, with, philosophical, disputes, between, the, metaphysical, views, of, newton, and, leibniz, and, variants, of, the, term, force, were, sometimes, used, to, denote, what, we, would, call, types, of, energy, for, example, in, 1742, milie, du, ch, telet, wrote, dead, force, consists, of, a, simple, tendency, to, motion, such, is, that, of, a, spring, ready, to, relax, living, force, is, that, which, a, body, has, when, it, is, in, actual, motion, in, modern, terminology, dead, force, and, living, force, correspond, to, potential, energy, and, kinetic, energy, respectively, conservation, of, energy, was, not, established, as, a, universal, principle, until, it, was, understood, that, the, energy, of, mechanical, work, can, be, dissipated, into, heat, with, the, concept, of, energy, given, a, solid, grounding, newton, s, laws, could, then, be, derived, within, formulations, of, classical, mechanics, that, put, energy, first, as, in, the, lagrangian, and, hamiltonian, formulations, described, above, modern, presentations, of, newton, s, laws, use, the, mathematics, of, vectors, a, topic, that, was, not, developed, until, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, vector, algebra, pioneered, by, josiah, willard, gibbs, and, oliver, heaviside, stemmed, from, and, largely, supplanted, the, earlier, system, of, quaternions, invented, by, william, rowan, hamilton
