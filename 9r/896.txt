in, thermodynamics, the, triple, point, of, a, substance, is, the, temperature, and, pressure, at, which, the, three, phases, gas, liquid, and, solid, of, that, substance, coexist, in, thermodynamic, equilibrium, it, is, that, temperature, and, pressure, at, which, the, sublimation, fusion, and, vaporisation, curves, meet, for, example, the, triple, point, of, mercury, occurs, at, a, temperature, of, 38, 8, c, 37, 8, f, and, a, pressure, of, 0, 165, m, pa, in, addition, to, the, triple, point, for, solid, liquid, and, gas, phases, a, triple, point, may, involve, more, than, one, solid, phase, for, substances, with, multiple, polymorphs, helium, 4, is, unusual, in, that, it, has, no, sublimation, deposition, curve, and, therefore, no, triple, points, where, its, solid, phase, meets, its, gas, phase, instead, it, has, a, vapor, liquid, superfluid, point, a, solid, liquid, superfluid, point, a, solid, solid, liquid, point, and, a, solid, solid, superfluid, point, none, of, these, should, be, confused, with, the, lambda, point, which, is, not, any, kind, of, triple, point, the, term, triple, point, was, coined, in, 1873, by, james, thomson, brother, of, lord, kelvin, the, triple, points, of, several, substances, are, used, to, define, points, in, the, its, 90, international, temperature, scale, ranging, from, the, triple, point, of, hydrogen, 13, 8033, k, to, the, triple, point, of, water, 273, 16, k, 0, 01, c, or, 32, 018, f, before, 2019, the, triple, point, of, water, was, used, to, define, the, kelvin, the, base, unit, of, thermodynamic, temperature, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, the, kelvin, was, defined, so, that, the, triple, point, of, water, is, exactly, 273, 16, k, but, that, changed, with, the, 2019, redefinition, of, si, base, units, where, the, kelvin, was, redefined, so, that, the, boltzmann, constant, is, exactly, 1, 380649, 10, 23, j, k, 1, and, the, triple, point, of, water, became, an, experimentally, measured, constant, following, the, 2019, redefinition, of, the, si, base, units, the, value, of, the, triple, point, of, water, is, no, longer, used, as, a, defining, point, however, its, empirical, value, remains, important, the, unique, combination, of, pressure, and, temperature, at, which, liquid, water, solid, ice, and, water, vapor, coexist, in, a, stable, equilibrium, is, approximately, 273, 16, 0, 0001, k, and, a, vapor, pressure, of, 611, 657, pascals, 6, 11657, mbar, 0, 00603659, atm, liquid, water, can, only, exist, at, pressures, equal, to, or, greater, than, the, triple, point, below, this, in, the, vacuum, of, outer, space, solid, ice, sublimates, transitioning, directly, into, water, vapor, when, heated, at, a, constant, pressure, conversely, above, the, triple, point, solid, ice, first, melts, into, liquid, water, upon, heating, at, a, constant, pressure, then, evaporates, or, boils, to, form, vapor, at, a, higher, temperature, for, most, substances, the, gas, liquid, solid, triple, point, is, the, minimum, temperature, where, the, liquid, can, exist, for, water, this, is, not, the, case, the, melting, point, of, ordinary, ice, decreases, with, pressure, as, shown, by, the, phase, diagram, s, dashed, green, line, just, below, the, triple, point, compression, at, a, constant, temperature, transforms, water, vapor, first, to, solid, and, then, to, liquid, historically, during, the, mariner, 9, mission, to, mars, the, triple, point, pressure, of, water, was, used, to, define, sea, level, now, laser, altimetry, and, gravitational, measurements, are, preferred, to, define, martian, elevation, at, high, pressures, water, has, a, complex, phase, diagram, with, 15, known, phases, of, ice, and, several, triple, points, including, 10, whose, coordinates, are, shown, in, the, diagram, for, example, the, triple, point, at, 251, k, 22, c, and, 210, mpa, 2070, atm, corresponds, to, the, conditions, for, the, coexistence, of, ice, ih, ordinary, ice, ice, iii, and, liquid, water, all, at, equilibrium, there, are, also, triple, points, for, the, coexistence, of, three, solid, phases, for, example, ice, ii, ice, v, and, ice, vi, at, 218, k, 55, c, and, 620, mpa, 6120, atm, for, those, high, pressure, forms, of, ice, which, can, exist, in, equilibrium, with, liquid, the, diagram, shows, that, melting, points, increase, with, pressure, at, temperatures, above, 273, k, 0, c, increasing, the, pressure, on, water, vapor, results, first, in, liquid, water, and, then, a, high, pressure, form, of, ice, in, the, range, 251, 273, k, ice, i, is, formed, first, followed, by, liquid, water, and, then, ice, iii, or, ice, v, followed, by, other, still, denser, high, pressure, forms, triple, point, cells, are, used, in, the, calibration, of, thermometers, for, exacting, work, triple, point, cells, are, typically, filled, with, a, highly, pure, chemical, substance, such, as, hydrogen, argon, mercury, or, water, depending, on, the, desired, temperature, the, purity, of, these, substances, can, be, such, that, only, one, part, in, a, million, is, a, contaminant, called, six, nines, because, it, is, 99, 9999, pure, a, specific, isotopic, composition, for, water, vsmow, is, used, because, variations, in, isotopic, composition, cause, small, changes, in, the, triple, point, triple, point, cells, are, so, effective, at, achieving, highly, precise, reproducible, temperatures, that, an, international, calibration, standard, for, thermometers, called, its, 90, relies, upon, triple, point, cells, of, hydrogen, neon, oxygen, argon, mercury, and, water, for, delineating, six, of, its, defined, temperature, points, this, table, lists, the, gas, liquid, solid, triple, points, of, several, substances, unless, otherwise, noted, the, data, come, from, the, u, s, national, bureau, of, standards, now, nist, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, notes
