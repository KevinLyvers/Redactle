the, ocean, is, the, body, of, salt, water, that, covers, approximately, 70, 8, of, earth, in, english, the, term, ocean, also, refers, to, any, of, the, large, bodies, of, water, into, which, the, world, ocean, is, conventionally, divided, the, following, names, describe, five, different, areas, of, the, ocean, pacific, atlantic, indian, antarctic, southern, and, arctic, the, ocean, contains, 97, of, earth, s, water, and, is, the, primary, component, of, earth, s, hydrosphere, thus, the, ocean, is, essential, to, life, on, earth, the, ocean, influences, climate, and, weather, patterns, the, carbon, cycle, and, the, water, cycle, by, acting, as, a, huge, heat, reservoir, ocean, scientists, split, the, ocean, into, vertical, and, horizontal, zones, based, on, physical, and, biological, conditions, the, pelagic, zone, is, the, open, ocean, s, water, column, from, the, surface, to, the, ocean, floor, the, water, column, is, further, divided, into, zones, based, on, depth, and, the, amount, of, light, present, the, photic, zone, starts, at, the, surface, and, is, defined, to, be, the, depth, at, which, light, intensity, is, only, 1, of, the, surface, value, 36, approximately, 200, m, in, the, open, ocean, this, is, the, zone, where, photosynthesis, can, occur, in, this, process, plants, and, microscopic, algae, free, floating, phytoplankton, use, light, water, carbon, dioxide, and, nutrients, to, produce, organic, matter, as, a, result, the, photic, zone, is, the, most, biodiverse, and, the, source, of, the, food, supply, which, sustains, most, of, the, ocean, ecosystem, ocean, photosynthesis, also, produces, half, of, the, oxygen, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, light, can, only, penetrate, a, few, hundred, more, meters, the, rest, of, the, deeper, ocean, is, cold, and, dark, these, zones, are, called, mesopelagic, and, aphotic, zones, the, continental, shelf, is, where, the, ocean, meets, dry, land, it, is, more, shallow, with, a, depth, of, a, few, hundred, meters, or, less, human, activity, often, has, negative, impacts, on, marine, life, within, the, continental, shelf, ocean, temperatures, depend, on, the, amount, of, solar, radiation, reaching, the, ocean, surface, in, the, tropics, surface, temperatures, can, rise, to, over, 30, c, 86, f, near, the, poles, where, sea, ice, forms, the, temperature, in, equilibrium, is, about, 2, c, 28, f, in, all, parts, of, the, ocean, deep, ocean, temperatures, range, between, 2, c, 28, f, and, 5, c, 41, f, constant, circulation, of, water, in, the, ocean, creates, ocean, currents, those, currents, are, caused, by, forces, operating, on, the, water, such, as, temperature, and, salinity, differences, atmospheric, circulation, wind, and, the, coriolis, effect, tides, create, tidal, currents, while, wind, and, waves, cause, surface, currents, the, gulf, stream, kuroshio, current, agulhas, current, and, antarctic, circumpolar, current, are, all, major, ocean, currents, such, currents, transport, massive, amounts, of, water, gases, pollutants, and, heat, to, different, parts, of, the, world, and, from, the, surface, into, the, deep, ocean, all, this, has, impacts, on, the, global, climate, system, ocean, water, contains, dissolved, gases, including, oxygen, carbon, dioxide, and, nitrogen, an, exchange, of, these, gases, occurs, at, the, ocean, s, surface, the, solubility, of, these, gases, depends, on, the, temperature, and, salinity, of, the, water, the, carbon, dioxide, concentration, in, the, atmosphere, is, rising, due, to, co, 2, emissions, mainly, from, fossil, fuel, combustion, as, the, oceans, absorb, co, 2, from, the, atmosphere, a, higher, concentration, leads, to, ocean, acidification, a, drop, in, ph, value, the, ocean, provides, many, benefits, to, humans, such, as, ecosystem, services, access, to, seafood, and, other, marine, resources, and, a, means, of, transport, the, ocean, is, known, to, be, the, habitat, of, over, 230, 000, species, but, may, hold, considerably, more, perhaps, over, two, million, species, yet, the, ocean, faces, many, environmental, threats, such, as, marine, pollution, overfishing, and, the, effects, of, climate, change, those, effects, include, ocean, warming, ocean, acidification, and, sea, level, rise, the, continental, shelf, and, coastal, waters, are, most, affected, by, human, activity, the, terms, the, ocean, or, the, sea, used, without, specification, refer, to, the, interconnected, body, of, salt, water, covering, the, majority, of, earth, s, surface, it, includes, the, pacific, atlantic, indian, southern, antarctic, and, arctic, oceans, as, a, general, term, the, ocean, and, the, sea, are, often, interchangeable, strictly, speaking, a, sea, is, a, body, of, water, generally, a, division, of, the, world, ocean, partly, or, fully, enclosed, by, land, the, word, sea, can, also, be, used, for, many, specific, much, smaller, bodies, of, seawater, such, as, the, north, sea, or, the, red, sea, there, is, no, sharp, distinction, between, seas, and, oceans, though, generally, seas, are, smaller, and, are, often, partly, as, marginal, seas, or, wholly, as, inland, seas, bordered, by, land, the, contemporary, concept, of, the, world, ocean, was, coined, in, the, early, 20th, century, by, the, russian, oceanographer, yuly, shokalsky, to, refer, to, the, continuous, ocean, that, covers, and, encircles, most, of, earth, the, global, interconnected, body, of, salt, water, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, world, ocean, global, ocean, or, the, great, ocean, the, concept, of, a, continuous, body, of, water, with, relatively, unrestricted, exchange, between, its, components, is, critical, in, oceanography, the, word, ocean, comes, from, the, figure, in, classical, antiquity, oceanus, o, s, i, n, s, greek, kean, s, pronounced, the, elder, of, the, titans, in, classical, greek, mythology, oceanus, was, believed, by, the, ancient, greeks, and, romans, to, be, the, divine, personification, of, an, enormous, river, encircling, the, world, the, concept, of, kean, s, has, an, indo, european, connection, greek, kean, s, has, been, compared, to, the, vedic, epithet, y, na, predicated, of, the, dragon, v, tra, who, captured, the, cows, rivers, related, to, this, notion, the, okeanos, is, represented, with, a, dragon, tail, on, some, early, greek, vases, scientists, believe, that, a, sizable, quantity, of, water, would, have, been, in, the, material, that, formed, earth, water, molecules, would, have, escaped, earth, s, gravity, more, easily, when, it, was, less, massive, during, its, formation, this, is, called, atmospheric, escape, during, planetary, formation, earth, possibly, had, magma, oceans, subsequently, outgassing, volcanic, activity, and, meteorite, impacts, produced, an, early, atmosphere, of, carbon, dioxide, nitrogen, and, water, vapor, according, to, current, theories, the, gases, and, the, atmosphere, are, thought, to, have, accumulated, over, millions, of, years, after, earth, s, surface, had, significantly, cooled, the, water, vapor, over, time, would, have, condensed, forming, earth, s, first, oceans, the, early, oceans, might, have, been, significantly, hotter, than, today, and, appeared, green, due, to, high, iron, content, geological, evidence, helps, constrain, the, time, frame, for, liquid, water, existing, on, earth, a, sample, of, pillow, basalt, a, type, of, rock, formed, during, an, underwater, eruption, was, recovered, from, the, isua, greenstone, belt, and, provides, evidence, that, water, existed, on, earth, 3, 8, billion, years, ago, in, the, nuvvuagittuq, greenstone, belt, quebec, canada, rocks, dated, at, 3, 8, billion, years, old, by, one, study, and, 4, 28, billion, years, old, by, another, show, evidence, of, the, presence, of, water, at, these, ages, if, oceans, existed, earlier, than, this, any, geological, evidence, either, has, yet, to, be, discovered, or, has, since, been, destroyed, by, geological, processes, like, crustal, recycling, however, in, august, 2020, researchers, reported, that, sufficient, water, to, fill, the, oceans, may, have, always, been, on, the, earth, since, the, beginning, of, the, planet, s, formation, in, this, model, atmospheric, greenhouse, gases, kept, the, oceans, from, freezing, when, the, newly, forming, sun, had, only, 70, of, its, current, luminosity, the, origin, of, earth, s, oceans, is, unknown, oceans, are, thought, to, have, formed, in, the, hadean, eon, and, may, have, been, the, cause, for, the, emergence, of, life, plate, tectonics, post, glacial, rebound, and, sea, level, rise, continually, change, the, coastline, and, structure, of, the, world, ocean, a, global, ocean, has, existed, in, one, form, or, another, on, earth, for, eons, since, its, formation, the, ocean, has, taken, many, conditions, and, shapes, with, many, past, ocean, divisions, and, potentially, at, times, covering, the, whole, globe, during, colder, climatic, periods, more, ice, caps, and, glaciers, form, and, enough, of, the, global, water, supply, accumulates, as, ice, to, lessen, the, amounts, in, other, parts, of, the, water, cycle, the, reverse, is, true, during, warm, periods, during, the, last, ice, age, glaciers, covered, almost, one, third, of, earth, s, land, mass, with, the, result, being, that, the, oceans, were, about, 122, m, 400, ft, lower, than, today, during, the, last, global, warm, spell, about, 125, 000, years, ago, the, seas, were, about, 5, 5, m, 18, ft, higher, than, they, are, now, about, three, million, years, ago, the, oceans, could, have, been, up, to, 50, m, 165, ft, higher, the, entire, ocean, containing, 97, of, earth, s, water, spans, 70, 8, of, earth, s, surface, making, it, earth, s, global, ocean, or, world, ocean, this, makes, earth, along, with, its, vibrant, hydrosphere, a, water, world, or, ocean, world, particularly, in, earth, s, early, history, when, the, ocean, is, thought, to, have, possibly, covered, earth, completely, the, ocean, s, shape, is, irregular, unevenly, dominating, the, earth, s, surface, this, leads, to, the, distinction, of, the, earth, s, surface, into, a, water, and, land, hemisphere, as, well, as, the, division, of, the, ocean, into, different, oceans, seawater, covers, about, 361, 000, 000, km, 2, 139, 000, 000, sq, mi, and, the, ocean, s, furthest, pole, of, inaccessibility, known, as, point, nemo, in, a, region, known, as, spacecraft, cemetery, of, the, south, pacific, ocean, at, 48, 52, 6, s, 123, 23, 6, w, 48, 8767, s, 123, 3933, w, 48, 8767, 123, 3933, point, nemo, this, point, is, roughly, 2, 688, km, 1, 670, mi, from, the, nearest, land, there, are, different, customs, to, subdivide, the, ocean, and, are, adjourned, by, smaller, bodies, of, water, such, as, seas, gulfs, bays, bights, and, straits, the, ocean, is, customarily, divided, into, five, principal, oceans, listed, below, in, descending, order, of, area, and, volume, the, ocean, fills, earth, s, oceanic, basins, earth, s, oceanic, basins, cover, different, geologic, provinces, of, earth, s, oceanic, crust, as, well, as, continental, crust, as, such, it, covers, mainly, earth, s, structural, basins, but, also, continental, shelfs, in, mid, ocean, magma, is, constantly, being, thrust, through, the, seabed, between, adjoining, plates, to, form, mid, oceanic, ridges, and, here, convection, currents, within, the, mantle, tend, to, drive, the, two, plates, apart, parallel, to, these, ridges, and, nearer, the, coasts, one, oceanic, plate, may, slide, beneath, another, oceanic, plate, in, a, process, known, as, subduction, deep, trenches, are, formed, here, and, the, process, is, accompanied, by, friction, as, the, plates, grind, together, the, movement, proceeds, in, jerks, which, cause, earthquakes, heat, is, produced, and, magma, is, forced, up, creating, underwater, mountains, some, of, which, may, form, chains, of, volcanic, islands, near, to, deep, trenches, near, some, of, the, boundaries, between, the, land, and, sea, the, slightly, denser, oceanic, plates, slide, beneath, the, continental, plates, and, more, subduction, trenches, are, formed, as, they, grate, together, the, continental, plates, are, deformed, and, buckle, causing, mountain, building, and, seismic, activity, every, ocean, basin, has, a, mid, ocean, ridge, which, creates, a, long, mountain, range, beneath, the, ocean, together, they, form, the, global, mid, oceanic, ridge, system, that, features, the, longest, mountain, range, in, the, world, the, longest, continuous, mountain, range, is, 65, 000, km, 40, 000, mi, this, underwater, mountain, range, is, several, times, longer, than, the, longest, continental, mountain, range, the, andes, oceanographers, state, that, less, than, 20, of, the, oceans, have, been, mapped, the, zone, where, land, meets, sea, is, known, as, the, coast, and, the, part, between, the, lowest, spring, tides, and, the, upper, limit, reached, by, splashing, waves, is, the, shore, a, beach, is, the, accumulation, of, sand, or, shingle, on, the, shore, a, headland, is, a, point, of, land, jutting, out, into, the, sea, and, a, larger, promontory, is, known, as, a, cape, the, indentation, of, a, coastline, especially, between, two, headlands, is, a, bay, a, small, bay, with, a, narrow, inlet, is, a, cove, and, a, large, bay, may, be, referred, to, as, a, gulf, coastlines, are, influenced, by, several, factors, including, the, strength, of, the, waves, arriving, on, the, shore, the, gradient, of, the, land, margin, the, composition, and, hardness, of, the, coastal, rock, the, inclination, of, the, off, shore, slope, and, the, changes, of, the, level, of, the, land, due, to, local, uplift, or, submergence, normally, waves, roll, towards, the, shore, at, the, rate, of, six, to, eight, per, minute, and, these, are, known, as, constructive, waves, as, they, tend, to, move, material, up, the, beach, and, have, little, erosive, effect, storm, waves, arrive, on, shore, in, rapid, succession, and, are, known, as, destructive, waves, as, the, swash, moves, beach, material, seawards, under, their, influence, the, sand, and, shingle, on, the, beach, is, ground, together, and, abraded, around, high, tide, the, power, of, a, storm, wave, impacting, on, the, foot, of, a, cliff, has, a, shattering, effect, as, air, in, cracks, and, crevices, is, compressed, and, then, expands, rapidly, with, release, of, pressure, at, the, same, time, sand, and, pebbles, have, an, erosive, effect, as, they, are, thrown, against, the, rocks, this, tends, to, undercut, the, cliff, and, normal, weathering, processes, such, as, the, action, of, frost, follows, causing, further, destruction, gradually, a, wave, cut, platform, develops, at, the, foot, of, the, cliff, and, this, has, a, protective, effect, reducing, further, wave, erosion, material, worn, from, the, margins, of, the, land, eventually, ends, up, in, the, sea, here, it, is, subject, to, attrition, as, currents, flowing, parallel, to, the, coast, scour, out, channels, and, transport, sand, and, pebbles, away, from, their, place, of, origin, sediment, carried, to, the, sea, by, rivers, settles, on, the, seabed, causing, deltas, to, form, in, estuaries, all, these, materials, move, back, and, forth, under, the, influence, of, waves, tides, and, currents, dredging, removes, material, and, deepens, channels, but, may, have, unexpected, effects, elsewhere, on, the, coastline, governments, make, efforts, to, prevent, flooding, of, the, land, by, the, building, of, breakwaters, seawalls, dykes, and, levees, and, other, sea, defences, for, instance, the, thames, barrier, is, designed, to, protect, london, from, a, storm, surge, while, the, failure, of, the, dykes, and, levees, around, new, orleans, during, hurricane, katrina, created, a, humanitarian, crisis, in, the, united, states, most, of, the, ocean, is, blue, in, color, but, in, some, places, the, ocean, is, blue, green, green, or, even, yellow, to, brown, blue, ocean, color, is, a, result, of, several, factors, first, water, preferentially, absorbs, red, light, which, means, that, blue, light, remains, and, is, reflected, back, out, of, the, water, red, light, is, most, easily, absorbed, and, thus, does, not, reach, great, depths, usually, to, less, than, 50, meters, 164, ft, blue, light, in, comparison, can, penetrate, up, to, 200, meters, 656, ft, second, water, molecules, and, very, tiny, particles, in, ocean, water, preferentially, scatter, blue, light, more, than, light, of, other, colors, blue, light, scattering, by, water, and, tiny, particles, happens, even, in, the, very, clearest, ocean, water, and, is, similar, to, blue, light, scattering, in, the, sky, ocean, water, represents, the, largest, body, of, water, within, the, global, water, cycle, oceans, contain, 97, of, earth, s, water, evaporation, from, the, ocean, moves, water, into, the, atmosphere, to, later, rain, back, down, onto, land, and, the, ocean, oceans, have, a, significant, effect, on, the, biosphere, the, ocean, as, a, whole, is, thought, to, cover, approximately, 90, of, the, earth, s, biosphere, oceanic, evaporation, as, a, phase, of, the, water, cycle, is, the, source, of, most, rainfall, about, 90, causing, a, global, cloud, cover, of, 67, and, a, consistent, oceanic, cloud, cover, of, 72, ocean, temperatures, affect, climate, and, wind, patterns, that, affect, life, on, land, one, of, the, most, dramatic, forms, of, weather, occurs, over, the, oceans, tropical, cyclones, also, called, typhoons, and, hurricanes, depending, upon, where, the, system, forms, as, the, world, s, ocean, is, the, principal, component, of, earth, s, hydrosphere, it, is, integral, to, life, on, earth, forms, part, of, the, carbon, cycle, and, water, cycle, and, as, a, huge, heat, reservoir, influences, climate, and, weather, patterns, the, motions, of, the, ocean, surface, known, as, undulations, or, wind, waves, are, the, partial, and, alternate, rising, and, falling, of, the, ocean, surface, the, series, of, mechanical, waves, that, propagate, along, the, interface, between, water, and, air, is, called, swell, a, term, used, in, sailing, surfing, and, navigation, these, motions, profoundly, affect, ships, on, the, surface, of, the, ocean, and, the, well, being, of, people, on, those, ships, who, might, suffer, from, sea, sickness, wind, blowing, over, the, surface, of, a, body, of, water, forms, waves, that, are, perpendicular, to, the, direction, of, the, wind, the, friction, between, air, and, water, caused, by, a, gentle, breeze, on, a, pond, causes, ripples, to, form, a, stronger, gust, blowing, over, the, ocean, causes, larger, waves, as, the, moving, air, pushes, against, the, raised, ridges, of, water, the, waves, reach, their, maximum, height, when, the, rate, at, which, they, are, travelling, nearly, matches, the, speed, of, the, wind, in, open, water, when, the, wind, blows, continuously, as, happens, in, the, southern, hemisphere, in, the, roaring, forties, long, organized, masses, of, water, called, swell, roll, across, the, ocean, 83, 84, if, the, wind, dies, down, the, wave, formation, is, reduced, but, already, formed, waves, continue, to, travel, in, their, original, direction, until, they, meet, land, the, size, of, the, waves, depends, on, the, fetch, the, distance, that, the, wind, has, blown, over, the, water, and, the, strength, and, duration, of, that, wind, when, waves, meet, others, coming, from, different, directions, interference, between, the, two, can, produce, broken, irregular, seas, constructive, interference, can, lead, to, the, formation, of, unusually, high, rogue, waves, most, waves, are, less, than, 3, m, 10, ft, high, and, it, is, not, unusual, for, strong, storms, to, double, or, triple, that, height, rogue, waves, however, have, been, documented, at, heights, above, 25, meters, 82, ft, the, top, of, a, wave, is, known, as, the, crest, the, lowest, point, between, waves, is, the, trough, and, the, distance, between, the, crests, is, the, wavelength, the, wave, is, pushed, across, the, surface, of, the, ocean, by, the, wind, but, this, represents, a, transfer, of, energy, and, not, horizontal, movement, of, water, as, waves, approach, land, and, move, into, shallow, water, they, change, their, behavior, if, approaching, at, an, angle, waves, may, bend, refraction, or, wrap, around, rocks, and, headlands, diffraction, when, the, wave, reaches, a, point, where, its, deepest, oscillations, of, the, water, contact, the, ocean, floor, they, begin, to, slow, down, this, pulls, the, crests, closer, together, and, increases, the, waves, height, which, is, called, wave, shoaling, when, the, ratio, of, the, wave, s, height, to, the, water, depth, increases, above, a, certain, limit, it, breaks, toppling, over, in, a, mass, of, foaming, water, this, rushes, in, a, sheet, up, the, beach, before, retreating, into, the, ocean, under, the, influence, of, gravity, earthquakes, volcanic, eruptions, or, other, major, geological, disturbances, can, set, off, waves, that, can, lead, to, tsunamis, in, coastal, areas, which, can, be, very, dangerous, the, ocean, s, surface, is, an, important, reference, point, for, oceanography, and, geography, particularly, as, mean, sea, level, the, ocean, surface, has, globally, little, but, measurable, topography, depending, on, the, ocean, s, volumes, the, ocean, surface, is, a, crucial, interface, for, oceanic, and, atmospheric, processes, allowing, interchange, of, particles, enriching, the, air, and, water, as, well, as, grounds, by, some, particles, becoming, sediments, this, interchange, has, fertilized, life, in, the, ocean, on, land, and, air, all, these, processes, and, components, together, make, up, ocean, surface, ecosystems, tides, are, the, regular, rise, and, fall, in, water, level, experienced, by, oceans, primarily, driven, by, the, moon, s, gravitational, tidal, forces, upon, the, earth, tidal, forces, affect, all, matter, on, earth, but, only, fluids, like, the, ocean, demonstrate, the, effects, on, human, timescales, for, example, tidal, forces, acting, on, rock, may, produce, tidal, locking, between, two, planetary, bodies, though, primarily, driven, by, the, moon, s, gravity, oceanic, tides, are, also, substantially, modulated, by, the, sun, s, tidal, forces, by, the, rotation, of, the, earth, and, by, the, shape, of, the, rocky, continents, blocking, oceanic, water, flow, tidal, forces, vary, more, with, distance, than, the, base, force, of, gravity, the, moon, s, tidal, forces, on, earth, are, more, than, double, the, sun, s, despite, the, latter, s, much, stronger, gravitational, force, on, earth, earth, s, tidal, forces, upon, the, moon, are, 20x, stronger, than, the, moon, s, tidal, forces, on, the, earth, the, primary, effect, of, lunar, tidal, forces, is, to, bulge, earth, matter, towards, the, near, and, far, sides, of, the, earth, relative, to, the, moon, the, perpendicular, sides, from, which, the, moon, appears, in, line, with, the, local, horizon, experience, tidal, troughs, since, it, takes, nearly, 25, hours, for, the, earth, to, rotate, under, the, moon, accounting, for, the, moon, s, 28, day, orbit, around, earth, tides, thus, cycle, over, a, course, of, 12, 5, hours, however, the, rocky, continents, pose, obstacles, for, the, tidal, bulges, so, the, timing, of, tidal, maxima, may, not, actually, align, with, the, moon, in, most, localities, on, earth, as, the, oceans, are, forced, to, dodge, the, continents, timing, and, magnitude, of, tides, vary, widely, across, the, earth, as, a, result, of, the, continents, thus, knowing, the, moon, s, position, does, not, allow, a, local, to, predict, tide, timings, instead, requiring, precomputed, tide, tables, which, account, for, the, continents, and, the, sun, among, others, during, each, tidal, cycle, at, any, given, place, the, tidal, waters, rise, to, maximum, height, high, tide, before, ebbing, away, again, to, the, minimum, level, low, tide, as, the, water, recedes, it, gradually, reveals, the, foreshore, also, known, as, the, intertidal, zone, the, difference, in, height, between, the, high, tide, and, low, tide, is, known, as, the, tidal, range, or, tidal, amplitude, when, the, sun, and, moon, are, aligned, full, moon, or, new, moon, the, combined, effect, results, in, the, higher, spring, tides, while, the, sun, and, moon, misaligning, half, moons, result, in, lesser, tidal, ranges, in, the, open, ocean, tidal, ranges, are, less, than, 1, meter, but, in, coastal, areas, these, tidal, ranges, increase, to, more, than, 10, meters, in, some, areas, some, of, the, largest, tidal, ranges, in, the, world, occur, in, the, bay, of, fundy, and, ungava, bay, in, canada, reaching, up, to, 16, meters, other, locations, with, record, high, tidal, ranges, include, the, bristol, channel, between, england, and, wales, cook, inlet, in, alaska, and, the, r, o, gallegos, in, argentina, tides, are, not, to, be, confused, with, storm, surges, which, can, occur, when, high, winds, pile, water, up, against, the, coast, in, a, shallow, area, and, this, coupled, with, a, low, pressure, system, can, raise, the, surface, of, the, ocean, dramatically, above, a, typical, high, tide, the, average, depth, of, the, oceans, is, about, 4, km, more, precisely, the, average, depth, is, 3, 688, meters, 12, 100, ft, nearly, half, of, the, world, s, marine, waters, are, over, 3, 000, meters, 9, 800, ft, deep, deep, ocean, which, is, anything, below, 200, meters, 660, ft, covers, about, 66, of, earth, s, surface, this, figure, does, not, include, seas, not, connected, to, the, world, ocean, such, as, the, caspian, sea, the, deepest, region, of, the, ocean, is, at, the, mariana, trench, located, in, the, pacific, ocean, near, the, northern, mariana, islands, the, maximum, depth, has, been, estimated, to, be, 10, 971, meters, 35, 994, ft, the, british, naval, vessel, challenger, ii, surveyed, the, trench, in, 1951, and, named, the, deepest, part, of, the, trench, the, challenger, deep, in, 1960, the, trieste, successfully, reached, the, bottom, of, the, trench, manned, by, a, crew, of, two, men, oceanographers, classify, the, ocean, into, vertical, and, horizontal, zones, based, on, physical, and, biological, conditions, the, pelagic, zone, consists, of, the, water, column, of, the, open, ocean, and, can, be, divided, into, further, regions, categorized, by, light, abundance, and, by, depth, the, ocean, zones, can, be, grouped, by, light, penetration, into, from, top, to, bottom, the, photic, zone, the, mesopelagic, zone, and, the, aphotic, deep, ocean, zone, the, pelagic, part, of, the, aphotic, zone, can, be, further, divided, into, vertical, regions, according, to, depth, and, temperature, distinct, boundaries, between, ocean, surface, waters, and, deep, waters, can, be, drawn, based, on, the, properties, of, the, water, these, boundaries, are, called, thermoclines, temperature, haloclines, salinity, chemoclines, chemistry, and, pycnoclines, density, if, a, zone, undergoes, dramatic, changes, in, temperature, with, depth, it, contains, a, thermocline, a, distinct, boundary, between, warmer, surface, water, and, colder, deep, water, in, tropical, regions, the, thermocline, is, typically, deeper, compared, to, higher, latitudes, unlike, polar, waters, where, solar, energy, input, is, limited, temperature, stratification, is, less, pronounced, and, a, distinct, thermocline, is, often, absent, this, is, due, to, the, fact, that, surface, waters, in, polar, latitudes, are, nearly, as, cold, as, deeper, waters, below, the, thermocline, water, everywhere, in, the, ocean, is, very, cold, ranging, from, 1, c, to, 3, c, because, this, deep, and, cold, layer, contains, the, bulk, of, ocean, water, the, average, temperature, of, the, world, ocean, is, 3, 9, c, if, a, zone, undergoes, dramatic, changes, in, salinity, with, depth, it, contains, a, halocline, if, a, zone, undergoes, a, strong, vertical, chemistry, gradient, with, depth, it, contains, a, chemocline, temperature, and, salinity, control, ocean, water, density, colder, and, saltier, water, is, denser, and, this, density, plays, a, crucial, role, in, regulating, the, global, water, circulation, within, the, ocean, the, halocline, often, coincides, with, the, thermocline, and, the, combination, produces, a, pronounced, pycnocline, a, boundary, between, less, dense, surface, water, and, dense, deep, water, the, pelagic, zone, can, be, further, subdivided, into, two, sub, regions, based, on, distance, from, land, the, neritic, zone, and, the, oceanic, zone, the, neritic, zone, covers, the, water, directly, above, the, continental, shelves, including, coastal, waters, on, the, other, hand, the, oceanic, zone, includes, all, the, completely, open, water, the, littoral, zone, covers, the, region, between, low, and, high, tide, and, represents, the, transitional, area, between, marine, and, terrestrial, conditions, it, is, also, known, as, the, intertidal, zone, because, it, is, the, area, where, tide, level, affects, the, conditions, of, the, region, the, combined, volume, of, water, in, all, the, oceans, is, roughly, 1, 335, billion, cubic, kilometers, 1, 335, sextillion, liters, 320, 3, million, cubic, miles, it, has, been, estimated, that, there, are, 1, 386, billion, cubic, kilometres, 333, million, cubic, miles, of, water, on, earth, this, includes, water, in, gaseous, liquid, and, frozen, forms, as, soil, moisture, groundwater, and, permafrost, in, the, earth, s, crust, to, a, depth, of, 2, km, oceans, and, seas, lakes, rivers, and, streams, wetlands, glaciers, ice, and, snow, cover, on, earth, s, surface, vapour, droplets, and, crystals, in, the, air, and, part, of, living, plants, animals, and, unicellular, organisms, of, the, biosphere, saltwater, accounts, for, 97, 5, of, this, amount, whereas, fresh, water, accounts, for, only, 2, 5, of, this, fresh, water, 68, 9, is, in, the, form, of, ice, and, permanent, snow, cover, in, the, arctic, the, antarctic, and, mountain, glaciers, 30, 8, is, in, the, form, of, fresh, groundwater, and, only, 0, 3, of, the, fresh, water, on, earth, is, in, easily, accessible, lakes, reservoirs, and, river, systems, ocean, temperatures, depends, on, the, amount, of, solar, radiation, falling, on, its, surface, in, the, tropics, with, the, sun, nearly, overhead, the, temperature, of, the, surface, layers, can, rise, to, over, 30, c, 86, f, while, near, the, poles, the, temperature, in, equilibrium, with, the, sea, ice, is, about, 2, c, 28, f, there, is, a, continuous, circulation, of, water, in, the, oceans, warm, surface, currents, cool, as, they, move, away, from, the, tropics, and, the, water, becomes, denser, and, sinks, the, cold, water, moves, back, towards, the, equator, as, a, deep, sea, current, driven, by, changes, in, the, temperature, and, density, of, the, water, before, eventually, welling, up, again, towards, the, surface, deep, ocean, water, has, a, temperature, between, 2, c, 28, f, and, 5, c, 41, f, in, all, parts, of, the, globe, the, temperature, gradient, over, the, water, depth, is, related, to, the, way, the, surface, water, mixes, with, deeper, water, or, does, not, mix, a, lack, of, mixing, is, called, ocean, stratification, this, depends, on, the, temperature, in, the, tropics, the, warm, surface, layer, of, about, 100, m, is, quite, stable, and, does, not, mix, much, with, deeper, water, while, near, the, poles, winter, cooling, and, storms, makes, the, surface, layer, denser, and, it, mixes, to, great, depth, and, then, stratifies, again, in, summer, the, photic, depth, is, typically, about, 100, m, but, varies, and, is, related, to, this, heated, surface, layer, the, temperature, and, salinity, of, ocean, waters, vary, significantly, across, different, regions, this, is, due, to, differences, in, the, local, water, balance, precipitation, vs, evaporation, and, the, sea, to, air, temperature, gradients, these, characteristics, can, vary, widely, from, one, ocean, region, to, another, the, table, below, provides, an, illustration, of, the, sort, of, values, usually, encountered, seawater, with, a, typical, salinity, of, 35, has, a, freezing, point, of, about, 1, 8, c, 28, 8, f, because, sea, ice, is, less, dense, than, water, it, floats, on, the, ocean, s, surface, as, does, fresh, water, ice, which, has, an, even, lower, density, sea, ice, covers, about, 7, of, the, earth, s, surface, and, about, 12, of, the, world, s, oceans, sea, ice, usually, starts, to, freeze, at, the, very, surface, initially, as, a, very, thin, ice, film, as, further, freezing, takes, place, this, ice, film, thickens, and, can, form, ice, sheets, the, ice, formed, incorporates, some, sea, salt, but, much, less, than, the, seawater, it, forms, from, as, the, ice, forms, with, low, salinity, this, results, in, saltier, residual, seawater, this, in, turn, increases, density, and, promotes, vertical, sinking, of, the, water, an, ocean, current, is, a, continuous, directed, flow, of, seawater, caused, by, several, forces, acting, upon, the, water, these, include, wind, the, coriolis, effect, temperature, and, salinity, differences, ocean, currents, are, primarily, horizontal, water, movements, that, have, different, origins, such, as, tides, for, tidal, currents, or, wind, and, waves, for, surface, currents, tidal, currents, are, in, phase, with, the, tide, hence, are, quasiperiodic, associated, with, the, influence, of, the, moon, and, sun, pull, on, the, ocean, water, tidal, currents, may, form, various, complex, patterns, in, certain, places, most, notably, around, headlands, non, periodic, or, non, tidal, currents, are, created, by, the, action, of, winds, and, changes, in, density, of, water, in, littoral, zones, breaking, waves, are, so, intense, and, the, depth, measurement, so, low, that, maritime, currents, reach, often, 1, to, 2, knots, the, wind, and, waves, create, surface, currents, designated, as, drift, currents, these, currents, can, decompose, in, one, quasi, permanent, current, which, varies, within, the, hourly, scale, and, one, movement, of, stokes, drift, under, the, effect, of, rapid, waves, movement, which, vary, on, timescales, of, a, couple, of, seconds, the, quasi, permanent, current, is, accelerated, by, the, breaking, of, waves, and, in, a, lesser, governing, effect, by, the, friction, of, the, wind, on, the, surface, this, acceleration, of, the, current, takes, place, in, the, direction, of, waves, and, dominant, wind, accordingly, when, the, ocean, depth, increases, the, rotation, of, the, earth, changes, the, direction, of, currents, in, proportion, with, the, increase, of, depth, while, friction, lowers, their, speed, at, a, certain, ocean, depth, the, current, changes, direction, and, is, seen, inverted, in, the, opposite, direction, with, current, speed, becoming, null, known, as, the, ekman, spiral, the, influence, of, these, currents, is, mainly, experienced, at, the, mixed, layer, of, the, ocean, surface, often, from, 400, to, 800, meters, of, maximum, depth, these, currents, can, considerably, change, and, are, dependent, on, the, yearly, seasons, if, the, mixed, layer, is, less, thick, 10, to, 20, meters, the, quasi, permanent, current, at, the, surface, can, adopt, quite, a, different, direction, in, relation, to, the, direction, of, the, wind, in, this, case, the, water, column, becomes, virtually, homogeneous, above, the, thermocline, the, wind, blowing, on, the, ocean, surface, will, set, the, water, in, motion, the, global, pattern, of, winds, also, called, atmospheric, circulation, creates, a, global, pattern, of, ocean, currents, these, are, driven, not, only, by, the, wind, but, also, by, the, effect, of, the, circulation, of, the, earth, coriolis, force, these, major, ocean, currents, include, the, gulf, stream, kuroshio, current, agulhas, current, and, antarctic, circumpolar, current, the, antarctic, circumpolar, current, encircles, antarctica, and, influences, the, area, s, climate, connecting, currents, in, several, oceans, collectively, currents, move, enormous, amounts, of, water, and, heat, around, the, globe, influencing, climate, these, wind, driven, currents, are, largely, confined, to, the, top, hundreds, of, meters, of, the, ocean, at, greater, depth, the, thermohaline, circulation, drives, water, motion, for, example, the, atlantic, meridional, overturning, circulation, amoc, is, driven, by, the, cooling, of, surface, waters, in, the, polar, latitudes, in, the, north, and, south, creating, dense, water, which, sinks, to, the, bottom, of, the, ocean, this, cold, and, dense, water, moves, slowly, away, from, the, poles, which, is, why, the, waters, in, the, deepest, layers, of, the, world, ocean, are, so, cold, this, deep, ocean, water, circulation, is, relatively, slow, and, water, at, the, bottom, of, the, ocean, can, be, isolated, from, the, ocean, surface, and, atmosphere, for, hundreds, or, even, a, few, thousand, years, this, circulation, has, important, impacts, on, the, global, climate, system, and, on, the, uptake, and, redistribution, of, pollutants, and, gases, such, as, carbon, dioxide, for, example, by, moving, contaminants, from, the, surface, into, the, deep, ocean, ocean, currents, greatly, affect, earth, s, climate, by, transferring, heat, from, the, tropics, to, the, polar, regions, this, affects, air, temperature, and, precipitation, in, coastal, regions, and, further, inland, surface, heat, and, freshwater, fluxes, create, global, density, gradients, which, drive, the, thermohaline, circulation, that, is, a, part, of, large, scale, ocean, circulation, it, plays, an, important, role, in, supplying, heat, to, the, polar, regions, and, thus, in, sea, ice, regulation, oceans, moderate, the, climate, of, locations, where, prevailing, winds, blow, in, from, the, ocean, at, similar, latitudes, a, place, on, earth, with, more, influence, from, the, ocean, will, have, a, more, moderate, climate, than, a, place, with, more, influence, from, land, for, example, the, cities, san, francisco, 37, 8, n, and, new, york, 40, 7, n, have, different, climates, because, san, francisco, has, more, influence, from, the, ocean, san, francisco, on, the, west, coast, of, north, america, gets, winds, from, the, west, over, the, pacific, ocean, new, york, on, the, east, coast, of, north, america, gets, winds, from, the, west, over, land, so, new, york, has, colder, winters, and, hotter, earlier, summers, than, san, francisco, warmer, ocean, currents, yield, warmer, climates, in, the, long, term, even, at, high, latitudes, at, similar, latitudes, a, place, influenced, by, warm, ocean, currents, will, have, a, warmer, climate, overall, than, a, place, influenced, by, cold, ocean, currents, changes, in, the, thermohaline, circulation, are, thought, to, have, significant, impacts, on, earth, s, energy, budget, because, the, thermohaline, circulation, determines, the, rate, at, which, deep, waters, reach, the, surface, it, may, also, significantly, influence, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, concentrations, modern, observations, climate, simulations, and, paleoclimate, reconstructions, suggest, that, the, atlantic, meridional, overturning, circulation, amoc, has, weakened, since, the, preindustrial, era, the, latest, climate, change, projections, in, 2021, suggest, that, the, amoc, is, likely, to, weaken, further, over, the, 21st, century, 19, such, a, weakening, could, cause, large, changes, to, global, climate, with, the, north, atlantic, particularly, vulnerable, 19, salinity, is, a, measure, of, the, total, amounts, of, dissolved, salts, in, seawater, it, was, originally, measured, via, measurement, of, the, amount, of, chloride, in, seawater, and, hence, termed, chlorinity, it, is, now, standard, practice, to, gauge, it, by, measuring, electrical, conductivity, of, the, water, sample, salinity, can, be, calculated, using, the, chlorinity, which, is, a, measure, of, the, total, mass, of, halogen, ions, includes, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and, iodine, in, seawater, according, to, an, international, agreement, the, following, formula, is, used, to, determine, salinity, the, average, ocean, water, chlorinity, is, about, 19, 2, and, thus, the, average, salinity, is, around, 34, 7, salinity, has, a, major, influence, on, the, density, of, seawater, a, zone, of, rapid, salinity, increase, with, depth, is, called, a, halocline, as, seawater, s, salt, content, increases, so, does, the, temperature, at, which, its, maximum, density, occurs, salinity, affects, both, the, freezing, and, boiling, points, of, water, with, the, boiling, point, increasing, with, salinity, at, atmospheric, pressure, normal, seawater, freezes, at, a, temperature, of, about, 2, c, salinity, is, higher, in, earth, s, oceans, where, there, is, more, evaporation, and, lower, where, there, is, more, precipitation, if, precipitation, exceeds, evaporation, as, is, the, case, in, polar, and, some, temperate, regions, salinity, will, be, lower, salinity, will, be, higher, if, evaporation, exceeds, precipitation, as, is, sometimes, the, case, in, tropical, regions, for, example, evaporation, is, greater, than, precipitation, in, the, mediterranean, sea, which, has, an, average, salinity, of, 38, more, saline, than, the, global, average, of, 34, 7, thus, oceanic, waters, in, polar, regions, have, lower, salinity, content, than, oceanic, waters, in, tropical, regions, however, when, sea, ice, forms, at, high, latitudes, salt, is, excluded, from, the, ice, as, it, forms, which, can, increase, the, salinity, in, the, residual, seawater, in, polar, regions, such, as, the, arctic, ocean, due, to, the, effects, of, climate, change, on, oceans, observations, of, sea, surface, salinity, between, 1950, and, 2019, indicate, that, regions, of, high, salinity, and, evaporation, have, become, more, saline, while, regions, of, low, salinity, and, more, precipitation, have, become, fresher, it, is, very, likely, that, the, pacific, and, antarctic, southern, oceans, have, freshened, while, the, atlantic, has, become, more, saline, ocean, water, contains, large, quantities, of, dissolved, gases, including, oxygen, carbon, dioxide, and, nitrogen, these, dissolve, into, ocean, water, via, gas, exchange, at, the, ocean, surface, with, the, solubility, of, these, gases, depending, on, the, temperature, and, salinity, of, the, water, the, four, most, abundant, gases, in, earth, s, atmosphere, and, oceans, are, nitrogen, oxygen, argon, and, carbon, dioxide, in, the, ocean, by, volume, the, most, abundant, gases, dissolved, in, seawater, are, carbon, dioxide, including, bicarbonate, and, carbonate, ions, 14, ml, l, on, average, nitrogen, 9, ml, l, and, oxygen, 5, ml, l, at, equilibrium, at, 24, c, 75, f, all, gases, are, more, soluble, more, easily, dissolved, in, colder, water, than, in, warmer, water, for, example, when, salinity, and, pressure, are, held, constant, oxygen, concentration, in, water, almost, doubles, when, the, temperature, drops, from, that, of, a, warm, summer, day, 30, c, 86, f, to, freezing, 0, c, 32, f, similarly, carbon, dioxide, and, nitrogen, gases, are, more, soluble, at, colder, temperatures, and, their, solubility, changes, with, temperature, at, different, rates, photosynthesis, in, the, surface, ocean, releases, oxygen, and, consumes, carbon, dioxide, phytoplankton, a, type, of, microscopic, free, floating, algae, controls, this, process, after, the, plants, have, grown, oxygen, is, consumed, and, carbon, dioxide, released, as, a, result, of, bacterial, decomposition, of, the, organic, matter, created, by, photosynthesis, in, the, ocean, the, sinking, and, bacterial, decomposition, of, some, organic, matter, in, deep, ocean, water, at, depths, where, the, waters, are, out, of, contact, with, the, atmosphere, leads, to, a, reduction, in, oxygen, concentrations, and, increase, in, carbon, dioxide, carbonate, and, bicarbonate, this, cycling, of, carbon, dioxide, in, oceans, is, an, important, part, of, the, global, carbon, cycle, the, oceans, represent, a, major, carbon, sink, for, carbon, dioxide, taken, up, from, the, atmosphere, by, photosynthesis, and, by, dissolution, see, also, carbon, sequestration, there, is, also, increased, attention, on, carbon, dioxide, uptake, in, coastal, marine, habitats, such, as, mangroves, and, saltmarshes, this, process, is, often, referred, to, as, blue, carbon, the, focus, is, on, these, ecosystems, because, they, are, strong, carbon, sinks, as, well, as, ecologically, important, habitats, under, threat, from, human, activities, and, environmental, degradation, as, deep, ocean, water, circulates, throughout, the, globe, it, contains, gradually, less, oxygen, and, gradually, more, carbon, dioxide, with, more, time, away, from, the, air, at, the, surface, this, gradual, decrease, in, oxygen, concentration, happens, as, sinking, organic, matter, continuously, gets, decomposed, during, the, time, the, water, is, out, of, contact, with, the, atmosphere, most, of, the, deep, waters, of, the, ocean, still, contain, relatively, high, concentrations, of, oxygen, sufficient, for, most, animals, to, survive, however, some, ocean, areas, have, very, low, oxygen, due, to, long, periods, of, isolation, of, the, water, from, the, atmosphere, these, oxygen, deficient, areas, called, oxygen, minimum, zones, or, hypoxic, waters, will, generally, be, made, worse, by, the, effects, of, climate, change, on, oceans, the, ph, value, at, the, surface, of, oceans, global, mean, surface, ph, is, currently, approximately, in, the, range, of, 8, 05, to, 8, 08, this, makes, it, slightly, alkaline, the, ph, value, at, the, surface, used, to, be, about, 8, 2, during, the, past, 300, million, years, however, between, 1950, and, 2020, the, average, ph, of, the, ocean, surface, fell, from, approximately, 8, 15, to, 8, 05, carbon, dioxide, emissions, from, human, activities, are, the, primary, cause, of, this, process, called, ocean, acidification, with, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, levels, exceeding, 410, ppm, in, 2020, co, 2, from, the, atmosphere, is, absorbed, by, the, oceans, this, produces, carbonic, acid, h, 2, co, 3, which, dissociates, into, a, bicarbonate, ion, hco, 3, and, a, hydrogen, ion, h, the, presence, of, free, hydrogen, ions, h, lowers, the, ph, of, the, ocean, there, is, a, natural, gradient, of, ph, in, the, ocean, which, is, related, to, the, breakdown, of, organic, matter, in, deep, water, which, slowly, lowers, the, ph, with, depth, the, ph, value, of, seawater, is, naturally, as, low, as, 7, 8, in, deep, ocean, waters, as, a, result, of, degradation, of, organic, matter, there, it, can, be, as, high, as, 8, 4, in, surface, waters, in, areas, of, high, biological, productivity, the, definition, of, global, mean, surface, ph, refers, to, the, top, layer, of, the, water, in, the, ocean, up, to, around, 20, or, 100, m, depth, in, comparison, the, average, depth, of, the, ocean, is, about, 4, km, the, ph, value, at, greater, depths, more, than, 100, m, has, not, yet, been, affected, by, ocean, acidification, in, the, same, way, there, is, a, large, body, of, deeper, water, where, the, natural, gradient, of, ph, from, 8, 2, to, about, 7, 8, still, exists, and, it, will, take, a, very, long, time, to, acidify, these, waters, and, equally, as, long, to, recover, from, that, acidification, but, as, the, top, layer, of, the, ocean, the, photic, zone, is, crucial, for, its, marine, productivity, any, changes, to, the, ph, value, and, temperature, of, the, top, layer, can, have, many, knock, on, effects, for, example, on, marine, life, and, ocean, currents, see, also, effects, of, climate, change, on, oceans, the, key, issue, in, terms, of, the, penetration, of, ocean, acidification, is, the, way, the, surface, water, mixes, with, deeper, water, or, does, not, mix, a, lack, of, mixing, is, called, ocean, stratification, this, in, turn, depends, on, the, water, temperature, and, hence, is, different, between, the, tropics, and, the, polar, regions, see, ocean, temperature, the, chemical, properties, of, seawater, complicate, ph, measurement, and, several, distinct, ph, scales, exist, in, chemical, oceanography, there, is, no, universally, accepted, reference, ph, scale, for, seawater, and, the, difference, between, measurements, based, on, multiple, reference, scales, may, be, up, to, 0, 14, units, alkalinity, is, the, balance, of, base, proton, acceptors, and, acids, proton, donors, in, seawater, or, indeed, any, natural, waters, the, alkalinity, acts, as, a, chemical, buffer, regulating, the, ph, of, seawater, while, there, are, many, ions, in, seawater, that, can, contribute, to, the, alkalinity, many, of, these, are, at, very, low, concentrations, this, means, that, the, carbonate, bicarbonate, and, borate, ions, are, the, only, significant, contributors, to, seawater, alkalinity, in, the, open, ocean, with, well, oxygenated, waters, the, first, two, of, these, ions, contribute, more, than, 95, of, this, alkalinity, the, chemical, equation, for, alkalinity, in, seawater, is, the, growth, of, phytoplankton, in, surface, ocean, waters, leads, to, the, conversion, of, some, bicarbonate, and, carbonate, ions, into, organic, matter, some, of, this, organic, matter, sinks, into, the, deep, ocean, where, it, is, broken, down, back, into, carbonate, and, bicarbonate, this, process, is, related, to, ocean, productivity, or, marine, primary, production, thus, alkalinity, tends, to, increase, with, depth, and, also, along, the, global, thermohaline, circulation, from, the, atlantic, to, the, pacific, and, indian, ocean, although, these, increases, are, small, the, concentrations, vary, overall, by, only, a, few, percent, the, absorption, of, co, 2, from, the, atmosphere, does, not, affect, the, ocean, s, alkalinity, 2252, it, does, lead, to, a, reduction, in, ph, value, though, termed, ocean, acidification, the, ocean, waters, contain, many, chemical, elements, as, dissolved, ions, elements, dissolved, in, ocean, waters, have, a, wide, range, of, concentrations, some, elements, have, very, high, concentrations, of, several, grams, per, liter, such, as, sodium, and, chloride, together, making, up, the, majority, of, ocean, salts, other, elements, such, as, iron, are, present, at, tiny, concentrations, of, just, a, few, nanograms, 10, 9, grams, per, liter, the, concentration, of, any, element, depends, on, its, rate, of, supply, to, the, ocean, and, its, rate, of, removal, elements, enter, the, ocean, from, rivers, the, atmosphere, and, hydrothermal, vents, elements, are, removed, from, ocean, water, by, sinking, and, becoming, buried, in, sediments, or, evaporating, to, the, atmosphere, in, the, case, of, water, and, some, gases, by, estimating, the, residence, time, of, an, element, oceanographers, examine, the, balance, of, input, and, removal, residence, time, is, the, average, time, the, element, would, spend, dissolved, in, the, ocean, before, it, is, removed, heavily, abundant, elements, in, ocean, water, such, as, sodium, have, high, input, rates, this, reflects, high, abundance, in, rocks, and, rapid, rock, weathering, paired, with, very, slow, removal, from, the, ocean, due, to, sodium, ions, being, comparatively, unreactive, and, highly, soluble, in, contrast, other, elements, such, as, iron, and, aluminium, are, abundant, in, rocks, but, very, insoluble, meaning, that, inputs, to, the, ocean, are, low, and, removal, is, rapid, these, cycles, represent, part, of, the, major, global, cycle, of, elements, that, has, gone, on, since, the, earth, first, formed, the, residence, times, of, the, very, abundant, elements, in, the, ocean, are, estimated, to, be, millions, of, years, while, for, highly, reactive, and, insoluble, elements, residence, times, are, only, hundreds, of, years, a, few, elements, such, as, nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, and, potassium, essential, for, life, are, major, components, of, biological, material, and, are, commonly, known, as, nutrients, nitrate, and, phosphate, have, ocean, residence, times, of, 10, 000, and, 69, 000, years, respectively, while, potassium, is, a, much, more, abundant, ion, in, the, ocean, with, a, residence, time, of, 12, million, years, the, biological, cycling, of, these, elements, means, that, this, represents, a, continuous, removal, process, from, the, ocean, s, water, column, as, degrading, organic, material, sinks, to, the, ocean, floor, as, sediment, phosphate, from, intensive, agriculture, and, untreated, sewage, is, transported, via, runoff, to, rivers, and, coastal, zones, to, the, ocean, where, it, is, metabolized, eventually, it, sinks, to, the, ocean, floor, and, is, no, longer, available, to, humans, as, a, commercial, resource, production, of, rock, phosphate, an, essential, ingredient, in, inorganic, fertilizer, is, a, slow, geological, process, that, occurs, in, some, of, the, world, s, ocean, sediments, rendering, mineable, sedimentary, apatite, phosphate, a, non, renewable, resource, see, peak, phosphorus, this, continual, net, deposition, loss, of, non, renewable, phosphate, from, human, activities, may, become, a, resource, issue, for, fertilizer, production, and, food, security, in, future, life, within, the, ocean, evolved, 3, billion, years, prior, to, life, on, land, both, the, depth, and, the, distance, from, shore, strongly, influence, the, biodiversity, of, the, plants, and, animals, present, in, each, region, the, diversity, of, life, in, the, ocean, is, immense, including, marine, life, sea, life, or, ocean, life, is, the, plants, animals, and, other, organisms, that, live, in, the, salt, water, of, seas, or, oceans, or, the, brackish, water, of, coastal, estuaries, at, a, fundamental, level, marine, life, affects, the, nature, of, the, planet, marine, organisms, mostly, microorganisms, produce, oxygen, and, sequester, carbon, marine, life, in, part, shape, and, protect, shorelines, and, some, marine, organisms, even, help, create, new, land, e, g, coral, building, reefs, the, ocean, has, been, linked, to, human, activity, throughout, history, these, activities, serve, a, wide, variety, of, purposes, including, navigation, and, exploration, naval, warfare, travel, shipping, and, trade, food, production, e, g, fishing, whaling, seaweed, farming, aquaculture, leisure, cruising, sailing, recreational, boat, fishing, scuba, diving, power, generation, see, marine, energy, and, offshore, wind, power, extractive, industries, offshore, drilling, and, deep, sea, mining, freshwater, production, via, desalination, many, of, the, world, s, goods, are, moved, by, ship, between, the, world, s, seaports, large, quantities, of, goods, are, transported, across, the, ocean, especially, across, the, atlantic, and, around, the, pacific, rim, many, types, of, cargo, including, manufactured, goods, are, typically, transported, in, standard, sized, lockable, containers, that, are, loaded, on, purpose, built, container, ships, at, dedicated, terminals, containerization, greatly, boosted, the, efficiency, and, reduced, the, cost, of, shipping, products, by, sea, this, was, a, major, factor, in, the, rise, of, globalization, and, exponential, increases, in, international, trade, in, the, mid, to, late, 20th, century, oceans, are, also, the, major, supply, source, for, the, fishing, industry, some, of, the, major, harvests, are, shrimp, fish, crabs, and, lobster, the, biggest, global, commercial, fishery, is, for, anchovies, alaska, pollock, and, tuna, 6, a, report, by, fao, in, 2020, stated, that, in, 2017, 34, percent, of, the, fish, stocks, of, the, world, s, marine, fisheries, were, classified, as, overfished, 54, fish, and, other, fishery, products, from, both, wild, fisheries, and, aquaculture, are, among, the, most, widely, consumed, sources, of, protein, and, other, essential, nutrients, data, in, 2017, showed, that, fish, consumption, accounted, for, 17, percent, of, the, global, population, s, intake, of, animal, proteins, to, fulfill, this, need, coastal, countries, have, exploited, marine, resources, in, their, exclusive, economic, zone, fishing, vessels, are, increasingly, venturing, out, to, exploit, stocks, in, international, waters, the, ocean, has, a, vast, amount, of, energy, carried, by, ocean, waves, tides, salinity, differences, and, ocean, temperature, differences, which, can, be, harnessed, to, generate, electricity, forms, of, sustainable, marine, energy, include, tidal, power, ocean, thermal, energy, and, wave, power, offshore, wind, power, is, captured, by, wind, turbines, placed, out, on, the, ocean, it, has, the, advantage, that, wind, speeds, are, higher, than, on, land, though, wind, farms, are, more, costly, to, construct, offshore, there, are, large, deposits, of, petroleum, as, oil, and, natural, gas, in, rocks, beneath, the, ocean, floor, offshore, platforms, and, drilling, rigs, extract, the, oil, or, gas, and, store, it, for, transport, to, land, freedom, of, the, seas, is, a, principle, in, international, law, dating, from, the, seventeenth, century, it, stresses, freedom, to, navigate, the, oceans, and, disapproves, of, war, fought, in, international, waters, today, this, concept, is, enshrined, in, the, united, nations, convention, on, the, law, of, the, sea, unclos, the, international, maritime, organization, imo, which, was, ratified, in, 1958, is, mainly, responsible, for, maritime, safety, liability, and, compensation, and, has, held, some, conventions, on, marine, pollution, related, to, shipping, incidents, ocean, governance, is, the, conduct, of, the, policy, actions, and, affairs, regarding, the, world, s, oceans, human, activities, affect, marine, life, and, marine, habitats, through, many, negative, influences, such, as, marine, pollution, including, marine, debris, and, microplastics, overfishing, ocean, acidification, and, other, effects, of, climate, change, on, oceans, there, are, many, effects, of, climate, change, on, oceans, one, of, the, main, ones, is, an, increase, in, ocean, temperatures, more, frequent, marine, heatwaves, are, linked, to, this, the, rising, temperature, contributes, to, a, rise, in, sea, levels, due, to, melting, ice, sheets, other, effects, on, oceans, include, sea, ice, decline, reducing, ph, values, and, oxygen, levels, as, well, as, increased, ocean, stratification, all, this, can, lead, to, changes, of, ocean, currents, for, example, a, weakening, of, the, atlantic, meridional, overturning, circulation, amoc, the, main, root, cause, of, these, changes, are, the, emissions, of, greenhouse, gases, from, human, activities, mainly, burning, of, fossil, fuels, carbon, dioxide, and, methane, are, examples, of, greenhouse, gases, the, additional, greenhouse, effect, leads, to, ocean, warming, because, the, ocean, takes, up, most, of, the, additional, heat, in, the, climate, system, the, ocean, also, absorbs, some, of, the, extra, carbon, dioxide, that, is, in, the, atmosphere, this, causes, the, ph, value, of, the, seawater, to, drop, scientists, estimate, that, the, ocean, absorbs, about, 25, of, all, human, caused, co, 2, emissions, the, various, layers, of, the, oceans, have, different, temperatures, for, example, the, water, is, colder, towards, the, bottom, of, the, ocean, this, temperature, stratification, will, increase, as, the, ocean, surface, warms, due, to, rising, air, temperatures, 471, connected, to, this, is, a, decline, in, mixing, of, the, ocean, layers, so, that, warm, water, stabilises, near, the, surface, a, reduction, of, cold, deep, water, circulation, follows, the, reduced, vertical, mixing, makes, it, harder, for, the, ocean, to, absorb, heat, so, a, larger, share, of, future, warming, goes, into, the, atmosphere, and, land, one, result, is, an, increase, in, the, amount, of, energy, available, for, tropical, cyclones, and, other, storms, another, result, is, a, decrease, in, nutrients, for, fish, in, the, upper, ocean, layers, these, changes, also, reduce, the, ocean, s, capacity, to, store, carbon, at, the, same, time, contrasts, in, salinity, are, increasing, salty, areas, are, becoming, saltier, and, fresher, areas, less, salty, warmer, water, cannot, contain, the, same, amount, of, oxygen, as, cold, water, as, a, result, oxygen, from, the, oceans, moves, to, the, atmosphere, increased, thermal, stratification, may, reduce, the, supply, of, oxygen, from, surface, waters, to, deeper, waters, this, lowers, the, water, s, oxygen, content, even, more, the, ocean, has, already, lost, oxygen, throughout, its, water, column, oxygen, minimum, zones, are, increasing, in, size, worldwide, 471, marine, pollution, occurs, when, substances, used, or, spread, by, humans, such, as, industrial, agricultural, and, residential, waste, particles, noise, excess, carbon, dioxide, or, invasive, organisms, enter, the, ocean, and, cause, harmful, effects, there, the, majority, of, this, waste, 80, comes, from, land, based, activity, although, marine, transportation, significantly, contributes, as, well, it, is, a, combination, of, chemicals, and, trash, most, of, which, comes, from, land, sources, and, is, washed, or, blown, into, the, ocean, this, pollution, results, in, damage, to, the, environment, to, the, health, of, all, organisms, and, to, economic, structures, worldwide, since, most, inputs, come, from, land, either, via, the, rivers, sewage, or, the, atmosphere, it, means, that, continental, shelves, are, more, vulnerable, to, pollution, air, pollution, is, also, a, contributing, factor, by, carrying, off, iron, carbonic, acid, nitrogen, silicon, sulfur, pesticides, or, dust, particles, into, the, ocean, the, pollution, often, comes, from, nonpoint, sources, such, as, agricultural, runoff, wind, blown, debris, and, dust, these, nonpoint, sources, are, largely, due, to, runoff, that, enters, the, ocean, through, rivers, but, wind, blown, debris, and, dust, can, also, play, a, role, as, these, pollutants, can, settle, into, waterways, and, oceans, pathways, of, pollution, include, direct, discharge, land, runoff, ship, pollution, bilge, pollution, atmospheric, pollution, and, potentially, deep, sea, mining, the, types, of, marine, pollution, can, be, grouped, as, pollution, from, marine, debris, plastic, pollution, including, microplastics, ocean, acidification, nutrient, pollution, toxins, and, underwater, noise, plastic, pollution, in, the, ocean, is, a, type, of, marine, pollution, by, plastics, ranging, in, size, from, large, original, material, such, as, bottles, and, bags, down, to, microplastics, formed, from, the, fragmentation, of, plastic, material, marine, debris, is, mainly, discarded, human, rubbish, which, floats, on, or, is, suspended, in, the, ocean, plastic, pollution, is, harmful, to, marine, life, another, concern, is, the, runoff, of, nutrients, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, from, intensive, agriculture, and, the, disposal, of, untreated, or, partially, treated, sewage, to, rivers, and, subsequently, oceans, these, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, nutrients, which, are, also, contained, in, fertilizers, stimulate, phytoplankton, and, macroalgal, growth, which, can, lead, to, harmful, algal, blooms, eutrophication, which, can, be, harmful, to, humans, as, well, as, marine, creatures, excessive, algal, growth, can, also, smother, sensitive, coral, reefs, and, lead, to, loss, of, biodiversity, and, coral, health, a, second, major, concern, is, that, the, degradation, of, algal, blooms, can, lead, to, consumption, of, oxygen, in, coastal, waters, a, situation, that, may, worsen, with, climate, change, as, warming, reduces, vertical, mixing, of, the, water, column, ocean, protection, serves, to, safeguard, the, ecosystems, in, the, oceans, upon, which, humans, depend, protecting, these, ecosystems, from, threats, is, a, major, component, of, environmental, protection, one, of, protective, measures, is, the, creation, and, enforcement, of, marine, protected, areas, mpas, marine, protection, may, need, to, be, considered, within, a, national, regional, and, international, context, other, measures, include, supply, chain, transparency, requirement, policies, policies, to, prevent, marine, pollution, ecosystem, assistance, e, g, for, coral, reefs, and, support, for, sustainable, seafood, e, g, sustainable, fishing, practices, and, types, of, aquaculture, there, is, also, the, protection, of, marine, resources, and, components, whose, extraction, or, disturbance, would, cause, substantial, harm, engagement, of, broader, publics, and, impacted, communities, and, the, development, of, ocean, clean, up, projects, removal, of, marine, plastic, pollution, examples, of, the, latter, include, clean, oceans, international, and, the, ocean, cleanup, in, 2021, 43, expert, scientists, published, the, first, scientific, framework, version, that, via, integration, review, clarifications, and, standardization, enables, the, evaluation, of, levels, of, protection, of, marine, protected, areas, and, can, serve, as, a, guide, for, any, subsequent, efforts, to, improve, plan, and, monitor, marine, protection, quality, and, extents, examples, are, the, efforts, towards, the, 30, protection, goal, of, the, global, deal, for, nature, and, the, un, s, sustainable, development, goal, 14, life, below, water, in, march, 2023, a, high, seas, treaty, was, signed, it, is, legally, binding, the, main, achievement, is, the, new, possibility, to, create, marine, protected, areas, in, international, waters, by, doing, so, the, agreement, now, makes, it, possible, to, protect, 30, of, the, oceans, by, 2030, part, of, the, 30, by, 30, target, the, treaty, has, articles, regarding, the, principle, polluter, pays, and, different, impacts, of, human, activities, including, areas, beyond, the, national, jurisdiction, of, the, countries, making, those, activities, the, agreement, was, adopted, by, the, 193, united, nations, member, states
