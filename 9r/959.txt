the, schr, dinger, equation, is, a, partial, differential, equation, that, governs, the, wave, function, of, a, quantum, mechanical, system, 1, 2, its, discovery, was, a, significant, landmark, in, the, development, of, quantum, mechanics, it, is, named, after, erwin, schr, dinger, who, postulated, the, equation, in, 1925, and, published, it, in, 1926, forming, the, basis, for, the, work, that, resulted, in, his, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 1933, conceptually, the, schr, dinger, equation, is, the, quantum, counterpart, of, newton, s, second, law, in, classical, mechanics, given, a, set, of, known, initial, conditions, newton, s, second, law, makes, a, mathematical, prediction, as, to, what, path, a, given, physical, system, will, take, over, time, the, schr, dinger, equation, gives, the, evolution, over, time, of, the, wave, function, the, quantum, mechanical, characterization, of, an, isolated, physical, system, the, equation, was, postulated, by, schr, dinger, based, on, a, postulate, of, louis, de, broglie, that, all, matter, has, an, associated, matter, wave, the, equation, predicted, bound, states, of, the, atom, in, agreement, with, experimental, observations, ii, 268, the, schr, dinger, equation, is, not, the, only, way, to, study, quantum, mechanical, systems, and, make, predictions, other, formulations, of, quantum, mechanics, include, matrix, mechanics, introduced, by, werner, heisenberg, and, the, path, integral, formulation, developed, chiefly, by, richard, feynman, when, these, approaches, are, compared, the, use, of, the, schr, dinger, equation, is, sometimes, called, wave, mechanics, the, klein, gordon, equation, is, a, wave, equation, which, is, the, relativistic, version, of, the, schr, dinger, equation, the, schr, dinger, equation, is, nonrelativistic, because, it, contains, a, first, derivative, in, time, and, a, second, derivative, in, space, and, therefore, space, time, are, not, on, equal, footing, paul, dirac, incorporated, special, relativity, and, quantum, mechanics, into, a, single, formulation, that, simplifies, to, the, schr, dinger, equation, in, the, non, relativistic, limit, this, is, the, dirac, equation, which, contains, a, single, derivative, in, both, space, and, time, the, second, derivative, pde, of, the, klein, gordon, equation, led, to, a, problem, with, probability, density, even, though, it, was, a, relativistic, wave, equation, the, probability, density, could, be, negative, which, is, physically, unviable, this, was, fixed, by, dirac, by, taking, the, so, called, square, root, of, the, klein, gordon, operator, and, in, turn, introducing, dirac, matrices, in, a, modern, context, the, klein, gordon, equation, describes, spin, less, particles, while, the, dirac, equation, describes, spin, 1, 2, particles, introductory, courses, on, physics, or, chemistry, typically, introduce, the, schr, dinger, equation, in, a, way, that, can, be, appreciated, knowing, only, the, concepts, and, notations, of, basic, calculus, particularly, derivatives, with, respect, to, space, and, time, a, special, case, of, the, schr, dinger, equation, that, admits, a, statement, in, those, terms, is, the, position, space, schr, dinger, equation, for, a, single, nonrelativistic, particle, in, one, dimension, i, t, x, t, 2, 2, m, 2, x, 2, v, x, t, x, t, displaystyle, i, hbar, frac, partial, partial, t, psi, x, t, left, psi, x, t, here, x, t, displaystyle, psi, x, t, is, a, wave, function, a, function, that, assigns, a, complex, number, to, each, point, x, displaystyle, x, at, each, time, t, displaystyle, t, the, parameter, m, displaystyle, m, is, the, mass, of, the, particle, and, v, x, t, displaystyle, v, x, t, is, the, potential, that, represents, the, environment, in, which, the, particle, exists, 74, the, constant, i, displaystyle, i, is, the, imaginary, unit, and, displaystyle, hbar, is, the, reduced, planck, constant, which, has, units, of, action, energy, multiplied, by, time, 10, broadening, beyond, this, simple, case, the, mathematical, formulation, of, quantum, mechanics, developed, by, paul, dirac, david, hilbert, john, von, neumann, and, hermann, weyl, defines, the, state, of, a, quantum, mechanical, system, to, be, a, vector, displaystyle, psi, rangle, belonging, to, a, separable, complex, hilbert, space, h, displaystyle, mathcal, h, this, vector, is, postulated, to, be, normalized, under, the, hilbert, space, s, inner, product, that, is, in, dirac, notation, it, obeys, 1, displaystyle, langle, psi, psi, rangle, 1, the, exact, nature, of, this, hilbert, space, is, dependent, on, the, system, for, example, for, describing, position, and, momentum, the, hilbert, space, is, the, space, of, square, integrable, functions, l, 2, displaystyle, l, 2, while, the, hilbert, space, for, the, spin, of, a, single, proton, is, the, two, dimensional, complex, vector, space, c, 2, displaystyle, mathbb, c, 2, with, the, usual, inner, product, 322, physical, quantities, of, interest, position, momentum, energy, spin, are, represented, by, observables, which, are, self, adjoint, operators, acting, on, the, hilbert, space, a, wave, function, can, be, an, eigenvector, of, an, observable, in, which, case, it, is, called, an, eigenstate, and, the, associated, eigenvalue, corresponds, to, the, value, of, the, observable, in, that, eigenstate, more, generally, a, quantum, state, will, be, a, linear, combination, of, the, eigenstates, known, as, a, quantum, superposition, when, an, observable, is, measured, the, result, will, be, one, of, its, eigenvalues, with, probability, given, by, the, born, rule, in, the, simplest, case, the, eigenvalue, displaystyle, lambda, is, non, degenerate, and, the, probability, is, given, by, 2, displaystyle, langle, lambda, psi, rangle, 2, where, displaystyle, lambda, rangle, is, its, associated, eigenvector, more, generally, the, eigenvalue, is, degenerate, and, the, probability, is, given, by, p, displaystyle, langle, psi, p, lambda, psi, rangle, where, p, displaystyle, p, lambda, is, the, projector, onto, its, associated, eigenspace, a, momentum, eigenstate, would, be, a, perfectly, monochromatic, wave, of, infinite, extent, which, is, not, square, integrable, likewise, a, position, eigenstate, would, be, a, dirac, delta, distribution, not, square, integrable, and, technically, not, a, function, at, all, consequently, neither, can, belong, to, the, particle, s, hilbert, space, physicists, sometimes, regard, these, eigenstates, as, generalized, eigenvectors, for, a, hilbert, space, composed, of, elements, outside, that, space, these, are, used, for, calculational, convenience, and, do, not, represent, physical, states, 100, 105, thus, a, position, space, wave, function, x, t, displaystyle, psi, x, t, as, used, above, can, be, written, as, the, inner, product, of, a, time, dependent, state, vector, t, displaystyle, psi, t, rangle, with, unphysical, but, convenient, position, eigenstates, x, displaystyle, x, rangle, x, t, x, t, displaystyle, psi, x, t, langle, x, psi, t, rangle, the, form, of, the, schr, dinger, equation, depends, on, the, physical, situation, the, most, general, form, is, the, time, dependent, schr, dinger, equation, which, gives, a, description, of, a, system, evolving, with, time, 143, i, d, d, t, t, h, t, displaystyle, i, hbar, frac, d, dt, vert, psi, t, rangle, hat, h, vert, psi, t, rangle, where, t, displaystyle, t, is, time, t, displaystyle, vert, psi, t, rangle, is, the, state, vector, of, the, quantum, system, displaystyle, psi, being, the, greek, letter, psi, and, h, displaystyle, hat, h, is, an, observable, the, hamiltonian, operator, the, term, schr, dinger, equation, can, refer, to, both, the, general, equation, or, the, specific, nonrelativistic, version, the, general, equation, is, indeed, quite, general, used, throughout, quantum, mechanics, for, everything, from, the, dirac, equation, to, quantum, field, theory, by, plugging, in, diverse, expressions, for, the, hamiltonian, the, specific, nonrelativistic, version, is, an, approximation, that, yields, accurate, results, in, many, situations, but, only, to, a, certain, extent, see, relativistic, quantum, mechanics, and, relativistic, quantum, field, theory, to, apply, the, schr, dinger, equation, write, down, the, hamiltonian, for, the, system, accounting, for, the, kinetic, and, potential, energies, of, the, particles, constituting, the, system, then, insert, it, into, the, schr, dinger, equation, the, resulting, partial, differential, equation, is, solved, for, the, wave, function, which, contains, information, about, the, system, in, practice, the, square, of, the, absolute, value, of, the, wave, function, at, each, point, is, taken, to, define, a, probability, density, function, 78, for, example, given, a, wave, function, in, position, space, x, t, displaystyle, psi, x, t, as, above, we, have, pr, x, t, x, t, 2, displaystyle, pr, x, t, psi, x, t, 2, the, time, dependent, schr, dinger, equation, described, above, predicts, that, wave, functions, can, form, standing, waves, called, stationary, states, these, states, are, particularly, important, as, their, individual, study, later, simplifies, the, task, of, solving, the, time, dependent, schr, dinger, equation, for, any, state, stationary, states, can, also, be, described, by, a, simpler, form, of, the, schr, dinger, equation, the, time, independent, schr, dinger, equation, h, e, displaystyle, operatorname, hat, h, psi, rangle, e, psi, rangle, where, e, displaystyle, e, is, the, energy, of, the, system, 134, this, is, only, used, when, the, hamiltonian, itself, is, not, dependent, on, time, explicitly, however, even, in, this, case, the, total, wave, function, is, dependent, on, time, as, explained, in, the, section, on, linearity, below, in, the, language, of, linear, algebra, this, equation, is, an, eigenvalue, equation, therefore, the, wave, function, is, an, eigenfunction, of, the, hamiltonian, operator, with, corresponding, eigenvalue, s, e, displaystyle, e, the, schr, dinger, equation, is, a, linear, differential, equation, meaning, that, if, two, state, vectors, 1, displaystyle, psi, 1, rangle, and, 2, displaystyle, psi, 2, rangle, are, solutions, then, so, is, any, linear, combination, a, 1, b, 2, displaystyle, psi, rangle, a, psi, 1, rangle, b, psi, 2, rangle, of, the, two, state, vectors, where, a, and, b, are, any, complex, numbers, 25, moreover, the, sum, can, be, extended, for, any, number, of, state, vectors, this, property, allows, superpositions, of, quantum, states, to, be, solutions, of, the, schr, dinger, equation, even, more, generally, it, holds, that, a, general, solution, to, the, schr, dinger, equation, can, be, found, by, taking, a, weighted, sum, over, a, basis, of, states, a, choice, often, employed, is, the, basis, of, energy, eigenstates, which, are, solutions, of, the, time, independent, schr, dinger, equation, in, this, basis, a, time, dependent, state, vector, t, displaystyle, psi, t, rangle, can, be, written, as, the, linear, combination, t, n, a, n, e, i, e, n, t, e, n, displaystyle, psi, t, rangle, sum, n, a, n, e, ie, n, t, hbar, psi, e, n, rangle, where, a, n, displaystyle, a, n, are, complex, numbers, and, the, vectors, e, n, displaystyle, psi, e, n, rangle, are, solutions, of, the, time, independent, equation, h, e, n, e, n, e, n, displaystyle, hat, h, psi, e, n, rangle, e, n, psi, e, n, rangle, holding, the, hamiltonian, h, displaystyle, hat, h, constant, the, schr, dinger, equation, has, the, solution, t, e, i, h, t, 0, displaystyle, psi, t, rangle, e, i, hat, h, t, hbar, psi, 0, rangle, the, operator, u, t, e, i, h, t, displaystyle, hat, u, t, e, i, hat, h, t, hbar, is, known, as, the, time, evolution, operator, and, it, is, unitary, it, preserves, the, inner, product, between, vectors, in, the, hilbert, space, unitarity, is, a, general, feature, of, time, evolution, under, the, schr, dinger, equation, if, the, initial, state, is, 0, displaystyle, psi, 0, rangle, then, the, state, at, a, later, time, t, displaystyle, t, will, be, given, by, t, u, t, 0, displaystyle, psi, t, rangle, hat, u, t, psi, 0, rangle, for, some, unitary, operator, u, t, displaystyle, hat, u, t, conversely, suppose, that, u, t, displaystyle, hat, u, t, is, a, continuous, family, of, unitary, operators, parameterized, by, t, displaystyle, t, without, loss, of, generality, the, parameterization, can, be, chosen, so, that, u, 0, displaystyle, hat, u, 0, is, the, identity, operator, and, that, u, t, n, n, u, t, displaystyle, hat, u, t, n, n, hat, u, t, for, any, n, 0, displaystyle, n, 0, then, u, t, displaystyle, hat, u, t, depends, upon, the, parameter, t, displaystyle, t, in, such, a, way, that, u, t, e, i, g, t, displaystyle, hat, u, t, e, i, hat, g, t, for, some, self, adjoint, operator, g, displaystyle, hat, g, called, the, generator, of, the, family, u, t, displaystyle, hat, u, t, a, hamiltonian, is, just, such, a, generator, up, to, the, factor, of, the, planck, constant, that, would, be, set, to, 1, in, natural, units, to, see, that, the, generator, is, hermitian, note, that, with, u, t, u, 0, i, g, t, displaystyle, hat, u, delta, t, approx, hat, u, 0, i, hat, g, delta, t, we, have, u, t, u, t, u, 0, i, g, t, u, 0, i, g, t, i, i, t, g, g, o, t, 2, displaystyle, hat, u, delta, t, dagger, hat, u, delta, t, approx, hat, u, 0, dagger, i, hat, g, dagger, delta, t, hat, u, 0, i, hat, g, delta, t, i, i, delta, t, hat, g, dagger, hat, g, o, delta, t, 2, so, u, t, displaystyle, hat, u, t, is, unitary, only, if, to, first, order, its, derivative, is, hermitian, the, schr, dinger, equation, is, often, presented, using, quantities, varying, as, functions, of, position, but, as, a, vector, operator, equation, it, has, a, valid, representation, in, any, arbitrary, complete, basis, of, kets, in, hilbert, space, as, mentioned, above, bases, that, lie, outside, the, physical, hilbert, space, are, also, employed, for, calculational, purposes, this, is, illustrated, by, the, position, space, and, momentum, space, schr, dinger, equations, for, a, nonrelativistic, spinless, particle, 182, the, hilbert, space, for, such, a, particle, is, the, space, of, complex, square, integrable, functions, on, three, dimensional, euclidean, space, and, its, hamiltonian, is, the, sum, of, a, kinetic, energy, term, that, is, quadratic, in, the, momentum, operator, and, a, potential, energy, term, i, d, d, t, t, 1,

position, vector, and, p, displaystyle, mathbf, p, for, a, three, dimensional, momentum, vector, the, position, space, schr, dinger, equation, is, i, t, r, t, 2, 2, m, 2, r, t, v, r, r, t,

fourier, transforms, of, the, wave, function, and, the, potential, i, t, p, t, p, 2, 2, m, p, t, 2, 3, 2, d, 3, p, v, p, p, p, t, displaystyle, i, hbar, frac, partial, partial, t, tilde, psi, mathbf,

mathbf, r, t, and, p, t, displaystyle, tilde, psi, mathbf, p, t, are, derived, from, t, displaystyle, psi, t, rangle, by, r, t, r, t, displaystyle, psi, mathbf, r, t, langle, mathbf, r, psi, t, rangle, p, t, p, t, displaystyle, tilde, psi, mathbf, p, t, langle, mathbf, p, psi, t, rangle, where, r, displaystyle, mathbf, r, rangle, and, p, displaystyle, mathbf, p, rangle, do, not, belong, to, the, hilbert, space, itself, but, have, well, defined, inner, products, with, all, elements, of, that, space, when, restricted, from, three, dimensions, to, one, the, position, space, equation, is, just, the, first, form, of, the, schr, dinger, equation, given, above, the, relation, between, position, and, momentum, in, quantum, mechanics, can, be, appreciated, in, a, single, dimension, in, canonical, quantization, the, classical, variables, x, displaystyle, x, and, p, displaystyle, p, are, promoted, to, self, adjoint, operators, x, displaystyle, hat, x, and, p, displaystyle, hat, p, that, satisfy, the, canonical, commutation, relation, x, p, i, displaystyle, i, hbar, this, implies, that, 190, x, p, i, d, d, x, x, displaystyle, langle, x, hat, p, psi, rangle, i, hbar, frac, d, dx, psi, x, so, the, action, of, the, momentum, operator, p, displaystyle, hat, p, in, the, position, space, representation, is, i, d, d, x, textstyle, i, hbar, frac, d, dx, thus, p, 2, displaystyle, hat, p, 2, becomes, a, second, derivative, and, in, three, dimensions, the, second, derivative, becomes, the, laplacian, 2, displaystyle, nabla, 2, the, canonical, commutation, relation, also, implies, that, the, position, and, momentum, operators, are, fourier, conjugates, of, each, other, consequently, functions, originally, defined, in, terms, of, their, position, dependence, can, be, converted, to, functions, of, momentum, using, the, fourier, transform, in, solid, state, physics, the, schr, dinger, equation, is, often, written, for, functions, of, momentum, as, bloch, s, theorem, ensures, the, periodic, crystal, lattice, potential, couples, p, displaystyle, tilde, psi, p, with, p, k, displaystyle, tilde, psi, p, k, for, only, discrete, reciprocal, lattice, vectors, k, displaystyle, k, this, makes, it, convenient, to, solve, the, momentum, space, schr, dinger, equation, at, each, point, in, the, brillouin, zone, independently, of, the, other, points, in, the, brillouin, zone, the, schr, dinger, equation, is, consistent, with, local, probability, conservation, 238, it, also, ensures, that, a, normalized, wavefunction, remains, normalized, after, time, evolution, in, matrix, mechanics, this, means, that, the, time, evolution, operator, is, a, unitary, operator, in, contrast, to, for, example, the, klein, gordon, equation, although, a, redefined, inner, product, of, a, wavefunction, can, be, time, independent, the, total, volume, integral, of, modulus, square, of, the, wavefunction, need, not, be, time, independent, the, continuity, equation, for, probability, in, non, relativistic, quantum, mechanics, is, stated, as, t, r, t, j, 0, displaystyle, frac, partial, partial, t, rho, left, mathbf, r, t, right, nabla, cdot, mathbf, j, 0, where, j, 1, 2, m, p, p, i, 2,

psi, nabla, psi, is, the, probability, current, or, probability, flux, flow, per, unit, area, if, the, wavefunction, is, represented, as, x, t, x, t, exp, i, s, x, t, textstyle, psi, bf, x, t, sqrt, rho, bf, x, t, exp, left, frac, is, bf, x, t, hbar, right, where, s, x, t, displaystyle, s, mathbf, x, t, is, a, real, function, which, represents, the, complex, phase, of, the, wavefunction, then, the, probability, flux, is, calculated, as, j, s, m, displaystyle, mathbf, j, frac, rho, nabla, s, m, hence, the, spatial, variation, of, the, phase, of, a, wavefunction, is, said, to, characterize, the, probability, flux, of, the, wavefunction, although, the, s, m, textstyle, frac, nabla, s, m, term, appears, to, play, the, role, of, velocity, it, does, not, represent, velocity, at, a, point, since, simultaneous, measurement, of, position, and, velocity, violates, uncertainty, principle, if, the, hamiltonian, is, not, an, explicit, function, of, time, schr, dinger, s, equation, reads, i,

on, the, right, side, depends, only, on, space, solving, the, equation, by, separation, of, variables, means, seeking, a, solution, of, the, form, of, a, product, of, spatial, and, temporal, parts, r,

the, system, only, and, t, displaystyle, tau, t, is, a, function, of, time, only, substituting, this, expression, for, displaystyle, psi, into, the, time, dependent, left, hand, side, shows, that, t,

any, number, of, particles, in, any, number, of, dimensions, in, a, time, independent, potential, the, standing, wave, solutions, of, the, time, independent, equation, are, the, states, with, definite, energy, instead, of, a, probability, distribution, of, different, energies, in, physics, these, standing, waves, are, called, stationary, states, or, energy, eigenstates, in, chemistry, they, are, called, atomic, orbitals, or, molecular, orbitals, superpositions, of, energy, eigenstates, change, their, properties, according, to, the, relative, phases, between, the, energy, levels, the, energy, eigenstates, form, a, basis, any, wave, function, may, be, written, as, a, sum, over, the, discrete, energy, states, or, an, integral, over, continuous, energy, states, or, more, generally, as, an, integral, over, a, measure, this, is, the, spectral, theorem, in, mathematics, and, in, a, finite, dimensional, state, space, it, is, just, a, statement, of, the, completeness, of, the, eigenvectors, of, a, hermitian, matrix, separation, of, variables, can, also, be, a, useful, method, for, the, time, independent, schr, dinger, equation, for, example, depending, on, the,

be, solved, exactly, a, method, known, as, perturbation, theory, one, simple, way, to, compare, classical, to, quantum, mechanics, is, to, consider, the, time, evolution, of, the, expected, position,

with, the, classical, behavior, the, second, is, not, if, the, pair, x, p, displaystyle, langle, x, rangle, langle, p, rangle, were, to, satisfy, newton, s, second, law, the, right, hand, side, of, the, second, equation, would, have, to, be, v, x, displaystyle, v, left, left, langle, x, right, rangle, right, which, is, typically, not, the, same, as, v, x, displaystyle, left, langle, v, x, right, rangle, for, a, general, v, displaystyle, v, therefore, quantum, mechanics, can, lead, to, predictions, where, expectation, values, do, not, mimic, the, classical, behavior, in, the, case, of, the, quantum, harmonic, oscillator, however, v, displaystyle, v, is, linear, and, this, distinction, disappears, so, that, in, this, very, special, case, the, expected, position, and, expected, momentum, do, exactly, follow, the, classical, trajectories, for, general, systems, the, best, we, can, hope, for, is, that, the, expected, position, and, momentum, will, approximately, follow, the, classical, trajectories, if, the, wave, function, is, highly, concentrated, around, a, point, x, 0, displaystyle, x, 0, then, v, x, displaystyle, v, left, left, langle, x, right, rangle, right, and, v, x, displaystyle, left, langle, v, x, right, rangle, will, be, almost, the, same, since, both, will, be, approximately, equal, to, v, x, 0, displaystyle, v, x, 0, in, that, case, the, expected, position,

convenient, way, to, describe, quantum, systems, and, their, behavior, when, the, preparation, of, a, system, is, only, imperfectly, known, or, when, the, system, under, investigation, is, a, part, of, a, larger, whole, density, matrices, may, be, used, instead, 74, a, density, matrix, is, a, positive, semi, definite, operator, whose, trace, is, equal, to, 1, the, term, density, operator, is, also, used, particularly, when, the, underlying, hilbert, space, is, infinite, dimensional, the, set, of, all, density, matrices, is, convex, and, the, extreme, points, are, the, operators, that, project, onto, vectors, in, the, hilbert, space, these, are, the, density, matrix, representations, of, wave, functions, in, dirac, notation, they, are, written, displaystyle, hat, rho, psi, rangle,

galilean, transformations, which, form, the, symmetry, group, of, newtonian, dynamics, moreover, processes, that, change, particle, number, are, natural, in, relativity, and, so, an, equation, for, one, particle, or, any, fixed, number, thereof, can, only, be, of, limited, use, a, more, general, form, of, the, schr, dinger, equation, that, also, applies, in, relativistic, situations, can, be, formulated, within, quantum, field, theory, qft, a, framework, that, allows, the, combination, of, quantum, mechanics, with, special, relativity, the, region, in, which, both, simultaneously, apply, may, be, described, by, relativistic, quantum, mechanics, such, descriptions, may, use, time, evolution, generated, by, a, hamiltonian, operator, as, in, the, schr, dinger, functional, method, attempts, to, combine, quantum, physics, with, special, relativity, began, with, building, relativistic, wave, equations, from, the, relativistic, energy, momentum, relation, e, 2, p, c, 2, m, 0, c, 2, 2, displaystyle, e, 2, pc, 2, left, m, 0, c, 2, right, 2, instead, of, nonrelativistic, energy, equations, the, klein, gordon, equation, and, the, dirac, equation, are, two, such, equations, the, klein, gordon, equation, 1, c, 2, 2, t, 2, 2, m, 2, c, 2, 2, displaystyle, frac, 1, c, 2, frac, partial, 2, partial, t, 2, psi, nabla, 2, psi, frac, m, 2, c, 2, hbar, 2, psi, was, the, first, such, equation, to, be, obtained, even, before, the, nonrelativistic, one, particle, schr, dinger, equation, and, applies, to, massive, spinless, particles, historically, dirac, obtained, the, dirac, equation, by, seeking, a, differential, equation, that, would, be, first, order, in, both, time, and, space, a, desirable, property, for, a, relativistic, theory, taking, the, square, root, of, the, left, hand, side, of, the, klein, gordon, equation, in, this, way, required, factorizing, it, into, a, product, of, two, operators, which, dirac, wrote, using, 4, 4, matrices, 1, 2, 3, displaystyle, alpha, 1, alpha, 2, alpha, 3, beta, consequently, the, wave, function, also, became, a, four, component, function, governed, by, the, dirac, equation, that, in, free, space, read, m, c, 2, c, n, 1, 3,

dinger, equation, with, the, time, derivative, of, the, wave, function, being, given, by, a, hamiltonian, operator, acting, upon, the, wave, function, including, influences, upon, the, particle, requires, modifying, the, hamiltonian, operator, for, example, the, dirac, hamiltonian, for, a, particle, of, mass, m, and, electric, charge, q, in, an, electromagnetic, field, described, by, the, electromagnetic, potentials, and, a, is, h, dirac, 0, c, p, q, a, m, c, 2, 0, q, displaystyle, hat, h, text, dirac, gamma, 0, left, in, which, the, 1, 2, 3, and, 0, are, the, dirac, gamma, matrices, related, to, the, spin, of, the, particle, the, dirac, equation, is, true, for, all, spin, 1, 2, particles, and, the, solutions, to, the, equation, are, 4, component, spinor, fields, with, two, components, corresponding, to, the, particle, and, the, other, two, for, the, antiparticle, for, the, klein, gordon, equation, the, general, form, of, the, schr, dinger, equation, is, inconvenient, to, use, and, in, practice, the, hamiltonian, is, not, expressed, in, an, analogous, way, to, the, dirac, hamiltonian, the, equations, for, relativistic, quantum, fields, of, which, the, klein, gordon, and, dirac, equations, are, two, examples, can, be, obtained, in, other, ways, such, as, starting, from, a, lagrangian, density, and, using, the, euler, lagrange, equations, for, fields, or, using, the, representation, theory, of, the, lorentz, group, in, which, certain, representations, can, be, used, to, fix, the, equation, for, a, free, particle, of, given, spin, and, mass, in, general, the, hamiltonian, to, be, substituted, in, the, general, schr, dinger, equation, is, not, just, a, function, of, the, position, and, momentum, operators, and, possibly, time, but, also, of, spin, matrices, also, the, solutions, to, a, relativistic, wave, equation, for, a, massive, particle, of, spin, s, are, complex, valued, 2, 2, s, 1, component, spinor, fields, as, originally, formulated, the, dirac, equation, is, an, equation, for, a, single, quantum, particle, just, like, the, single, particle, schr, dinger, equation, with, wave, function, x, t, displaystyle, psi, x, t, this, is, of, limited, use, in, relativistic, quantum, mechanics, where, particle, number, is, not, fixed, heuristically, this, complication, can, be, motivated, by, noting, that, mass, energy, equivalence, implies, material, particles, can, be, created, from, energy, a, common, way, to, address, this, in, qft, is, to, introduce, a, hilbert, space, where, the, basis, states, are, labeled, by, particle, number, a, so, called, fock, space, the, schr, dinger, equation, can, then, be, formulated, for, quantum, states, on, this, hilbert, space, however, because, the, schr, dinger, equation, picks, out, a, preferred, time, axis, the, lorentz, invariance, of, the, theory, is, no, longer, manifest, and, accordingly, the, theory, is, often, formulated, in, other, ways, following, max, planck, s, quantization, of, light, see, black, body, radiation, albert, einstein, interpreted, planck, s, quanta, to, be, photons, particles, of, light, and, proposed, that, the, energy, of, a, photon, is, proportional, to, its, frequency, one, of, the, first, signs, of, wave, particle, duality, since, energy, and, momentum, are, related, in, the, same, way, as, frequency, and, wave, number, in, special, relativity, it, followed, that, the, momentum, p, displaystyle, p, of, a, photon, is, inversely, proportional, to, its, wavelength, displaystyle, lambda, or, proportional, to, its, wave, number, k, displaystyle, k, p, h, k, displaystyle, p, frac, h, lambda, hbar, k, where, h, displaystyle, h, is, the, planck, constant, and, h, 2, displaystyle, hbar, h, 2, pi, is, the, reduced, planck, constant, louis, de, broglie, hypothesized, that, this, is, true, for, all, particles, even, particles, which, have, mass, such, as, electrons, he, showed, that, assuming, that, the, matter, waves, propagate, along, with, their, particle, counterparts, electrons, form, standing, waves, meaning, that, only, certain, discrete, rotational, frequencies, about, the, nucleus, of, an, atom, are, allowed, these, quantized, orbits, correspond, to, discrete, energy, levels, and, de, broglie, reproduced, the, bohr, model, formula, for, the, energy, levels, the, bohr, model, was, based, on, the, assumed, quantization, of, angular, momentum, l, displaystyle, l, according, to, l, n, h, 2, n, displaystyle, l, n, frac, h, 2, pi, n, hbar, according, to, de, broglie, the, electron, is, described,

confined, the, electron, wave, in, one, dimension, along, a, circular, orbit, of, radius, r, displaystyle, r, in, 1921, prior, to, de, broglie, arthur, c, lunn, at, the, university, of, chicago, had, used, the, same, argument, based, on, the, completion, of, the, relativistic, energy, momentum, 4, vector, to, derive, what, we, now, call, the, de, broglie, relation, unlike, de, broglie, lunn, went, on, to, formulate, the, differential, equation, now, known, as, the, schr, dinger, equation, and, solve, for, its, energy, eigenvalues, for, the, hydrogen, atom, the, paper, was, rejected, by, the, physical, review, according, to, kamen, following, up, on, de, broglie, s, ideas, physicist, peter, debye, made, an, offhand, comment, that, if, particles, behaved, as, waves, they, should, satisfy, some, sort, of, wave, equation, inspired, by, debye, s, remark, schr, dinger, decided, to, find, a, proper, 3, dimensional, wave, equation, for, the, electron, he, was, guided, by, william, rowan, hamilton, s, analogy, between, mechanics, and, optics, encoded, in, the, observation, that, the, zero, wavelength, limit, of, optics, resembles, a, mechanical, system, the, trajectories, of, light,

cabin, in, december, 1925, while, at, the, cabin, schr, dinger, decided, that, his, earlier, nonrelativistic, calculations, were, novel, enough, to, publish, and, decided, to, leave, off, the, problem, of, relativistic, corrections, for, the, future, despite, the, difficulties, in, solving, the, differential, equation, for, hydrogen, he, had, sought, help, from, his, friend, the,

displaystyle, psi, but, says, nothing, of, its, nature, schr, dinger, tried, to, interpret, the, real, part, of, t, displaystyle, psi, frac, partial, psi, partial, t, as, a, charge, density, and, then, revised, this, proposal, saying, in, his, next, paper, that, the, modulus, squared, of, displaystyle, psi, is, a, charge, density, this, approach, was, however, unsuccessful, in, 1926, just, a, few, days, after, this, paper, was, published, max, born, successfully, interpreted, displaystyle, psi, as, the, probability, amplitude, whose, modulus, squared, is, equal, to, probability, density, 220, later, schr, dinger, himself, explained, this, interpretation, as, follows, the, already, mentioned, psi, function, is, now, the, means, for, predicting, probability, of, measurement, results, in, it, is, embodied, the, momentarily, attained, sum, of, theoretically, based, future, expectation, somewhat, as, laid, down, in, a, catalog, the, schr, dinger, equation, provides, a, way, to, calculate, the, wave, function, of, a, system, and, how, it, changes, dynamically, in, time, however, the, schr, dinger, equation, does, not, directly, say, what, exactly, the, wave, function, is, the, meaning, of, the, schr, dinger, equation, and, how, the, mathematical, entities, in, it, relate, to, physical, reality, depends, upon, the, interpretation, of, quantum, mechanics, that, one, adopts, in, the, views, often, grouped, together, as, the, copenhagen, interpretation, a, system, s, wave, function, is, a, collection, of, statistical, information, about, that, system, the, schr, dinger, equation, relates, information, about, the, system, at, one, time, to, information, about, it, at, another, while, the, time, evolution, process, represented, by, the, schr, dinger, equation, is, continuous, and, deterministic, in, that, knowing, the, wave, function, at, one, instant, is, in, principle, sufficient, to, calculate, it, for, all, future, times, wave, functions, can, also, change, discontinuously, and, stochastically, during, a, measurement, the, wave, function, changes, according, to, this, school, of, thought, because, new, information, is, available, the, post, measurement, wave, function, generally, cannot, be, known, prior, to, the, measurement, but, the, probabilities, for, the, different, possibilities, can, be, calculated, using, the, born, rule, other, more, recent, interpretations, of, quantum, mechanics, such, as, relational, quantum, mechanics, and, qbism, also, give, the, schr, dinger, equation, a, status, of, this, sort, schr, dinger, himself, suggested, in, 1952, that, the, different, terms, of, a, superposition, evolving, under, the, schr, dinger, equation, are, not, alternatives, but, all, really, happen, simultaneously, this, has, been, interpreted, as, an, early, version, of, everett, s, many, worlds, interpretation, this, interpretation, formulated, independently, in, 1956, holds, that, all, the, possibilities, described, by, quantum, theory, simultaneously, occur, in, a, multiverse, composed, of, mostly, independent, parallel, universes, this, interpretation, removes, the, axiom, of, wave, function, collapse, leaving, only, continuous, evolution, under, the, schr, dinger, equation, and, so, all, possible, states, of, the, measured, system, and, the, measuring, apparatus, together, with, the, observer, are, present, in, a, real, physical, quantum, superposition, while, the, multiverse, is, deterministic, we, perceive, non, deterministic, behavior, governed, by, probabilities, because, we, do, not, observe, the, multiverse, as, a, whole, but, only, one, parallel, universe, at, a, time, exactly, how, this, is, supposed, to, work, has, been, the, subject, of, much, debate, why, we, should, assign, probabilities, at, all, to, outcomes, that, are, certain, to, occur, in, some, worlds, and, why, should, the, probabilities, be, given, by, the, born, rule, several, ways, to, answer, these, questions, in, the, many, worlds, framework, have, been, proposed, but, there, is, no, consensus, on, whether, they, are, successful, bohmian, mechanics, reformulates, quantum, mechanics, to, make, it, deterministic, at, the, price, of, adding, a, force, due, to, a, quantum, potential, it, attributes, to, each, physical, system, not, only, a, wave, function, but, in, addition, a, real, position, that, evolves, deterministically, under, a, nonlocal, guiding, equation, the, evolution, of, a, physical, system, is, given, at, all, times, by, the, schr, dinger, equation, together, with, the, guiding, equation
