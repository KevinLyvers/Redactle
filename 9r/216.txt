the, observable, universe, is, a, ball, shaped, region, of, the, universe, consisting, of, all, matter, that, can, be, observed, from, earth, or, its, space, based, telescopes, and, exploratory, probes, at, the, present, time, the, electromagnetic, radiation, from, these, objects, has, had, time, to, reach, the, solar, system, and, earth, since, the, beginning, of, the, cosmological, expansion, initially, it, was, estimated, that, there, may, be, 2, trillion, galaxies, in, the, observable, universe, that, number, was, reduced, in, 2021, to, several, hundred, billion, based, on, data, from, new, horizons, assuming, the, universe, is, isotropic, the, distance, to, the, edge, of, the, observable, universe, is, roughly, the, same, in, every, direction, that, is, the, observable, universe, is, a, spherical, region, centered, on, the, observer, every, location, in, the, universe, has, its, own, observable, universe, which, may, or, may, not, overlap, with, the, one, centered, on, earth, the, word, observable, in, this, sense, does, not, refer, to, the, capability, of, modern, technology, to, detect, light, or, other, information, from, an, object, or, whether, there, is, anything, to, be, detected, it, refers, to, the, physical, limit, created, by, the, speed, of, light, itself, no, signal, can, travel, faster, than, light, hence, there, is, a, maximum, distance, called, the, particle, horizon, beyond, which, nothing, can, be, detected, as, the, signals, could, not, have, reached, us, yet, sometimes, astrophysicists, distinguish, between, the, observable, universe, and, the, visible, universe, the, former, includes, signals, since, the, end, of, the, inflationary, epoch, while, the, latter, includes, only, signals, emitted, since, recombination, according, to, calculations, the, current, comoving, distance, to, particles, from, which, the, cosmic, microwave, background, radiation, cmbr, was, emitted, which, represents, the, radius, of, the, visible, universe, is, about, 14, 0, billion, parsecs, about, 45, 7, billion, light, years, the, comoving, distance, to, the, edge, of, the, observable, universe, is, about, 14, 3, billion, parsecs, about, 46, 6, billion, light, years, about, 2, larger, the, radius, of, the, observable, universe, is, therefore, estimated, to, be, about, 46, 5, billion, light, years, using, the, critical, density, and, the, diameter, of, the, observable, universe, the, total, mass, of, ordinary, matter, in, the, universe, can, be, calculated, to, be, about, 1, 5, 10, 53, kg, in, november, 2018, astronomers, reported, that, extragalactic, background, light, ebl, amounted, to, 4, 10, 84, photons, as, the, universe, s, expansion, is, accelerating, all, currently, observable, objects, outside, the, local, supercluster, will, eventually, appear, to, freeze, in, time, while, emitting, progressively, redder, and, fainter, light, for, instance, objects, with, the, current, redshift, z, from, 5, to, 10, will, only, be, observable, up, to, an, age, of, 4, 6, billion, years, in, addition, light, emitted, by, objects, currently, situated, beyond, a, certain, comoving, distance, currently, about, 19, billion, parsecs, will, never, reach, earth, the, universe, s, size, is, unknown, and, it, may, be, infinite, in, extent, some, parts, of, the, universe, are, too, far, away, for, the, light, emitted, since, the, big, bang, to, have, had, enough, time, to, reach, earth, or, space, based, instruments, and, therefore, lie, outside, the, observable, universe, in, the, future, light, from, distant, galaxies, will, have, had, more, time, to, travel, so, one, might, expect, that, additional, regions, will, become, observable, regions, distant, from, observers, such, as, us, are, expanding, away, faster, than, the, speed, of, light, at, rates, estimated, by, hubble, s, law, the, expansion, rate, appears, to, be, accelerating, which, dark, energy, was, proposed, to, explain, assuming, dark, energy, remains, constant, an, unchanging, cosmological, constant, so, that, the, expansion, rate, of, the, universe, continues, to, accelerate, there, is, a, future, visibility, limit, beyond, which, objects, will, never, enter, the, observable, universe, at, any, time, in, the, future, because, light, emitted, by, objects, outside, that, limit, could, never, reach, the, earth, note, that, because, the, hubble, parameter, is, decreasing, with, time, there, can, be, cases, where, a, galaxy, that, is, receding, from, earth, only, slightly, faster, than, light, emits, a, signal, that, eventually, reaches, earth, this, future, visibility, limit, is, calculated, at, a, comoving, distance, of, 19, billion, parsecs, 62, billion, light, years, assuming, the, universe, will, keep, expanding, forever, which, implies, the, number, of, galaxies, that, can, ever, be, theoretically, observed, in, the, infinite, future, is, only, larger, than, the, number, currently, observable, by, a, factor, of, 2, 36, ignoring, redshift, effects, in, principle, more, galaxies, will, become, observable, in, the, future, in, practice, an, increasing, number, of, galaxies, will, become, extremely, redshifted, due, to, ongoing, expansion, so, much, so, that, they, will, seem, to, disappear, from, view, and, become, invisible, a, galaxy, at, a, given, comoving, distance, is, defined, to, lie, within, the, observable, universe, if, we, can, receive, signals, emitted, by, the, galaxy, at, any, age, in, its, history, say, a, signal, sent, from, the, galaxy, only, 500, million, years, after, the, big, bang, because, of, the, universe, s, expansion, there, may, be, some, later, age, at, which, a, signal, sent, from, the, same, galaxy, can, never, reach, the, earth, at, any, point, in, the, infinite, future, so, for, example, we, might, never, see, what, the, galaxy, looked, like, 10, billion, years, after, the, big, bang, even, though, it, remains, at, the, same, comoving, distance, less, than, that, of, the, observable, universe, this, can, be, used, to, define, a, type, of, cosmic, event, horizon, whose, distance, from, the, earth, changes, over, time, for, example, the, current, distance, to, this, horizon, is, about, 16, billion, light, years, meaning, that, a, signal, from, an, event, happening, at, present, can, eventually, reach, the, earth, if, the, event, is, less, than, 16, billion, light, years, away, but, the, signal, will, never, reach, the, earth, if, the, event, is, further, away, the, space, before, this, cosmic, event, horizon, can, be, called, reachable, universe, that, is, all, galaxies, closer, than, that, could, be, reached, if, we, left, for, them, today, at, the, speed, of, light, all, galaxies, beyond, that, are, unreachable, simple, observation, will, show, the, future, visibility, limit, 62, billion, light, years, is, exactly, equal, to, the, reachable, limit, 16, billion, light, years, added, to, the, current, visibility, limit, 46, billion, light, years, both, popular, and, professional, research, articles, in, cosmology, often, use, the, term, universe, to, mean, observable, universe, this, can, be, justified, on, the, grounds, that, we, can, never, know, anything, by, direct, observation, about, any, part, of, the, universe, that, is, causally, disconnected, from, the, earth, although, many, credible, theories, require, a, total, universe, much, larger, than, the, observable, universe, no, evidence, exists, to, suggest, that, the, boundary, of, the, observable, universe, constitutes, a, boundary, on, the, universe, as, a, whole, nor, do, any, of, the, mainstream, cosmological, models, propose, that, the, universe, has, any, physical, boundary, in, the, first, place, however, some, models, propose, it, could, be, finite, but, unbounded, like, a, higher, dimensional, analogue, of, the, 2d, surface, of, a, sphere, that, is, finite, in, area, but, has, no, edge, it, is, plausible, that, the, galaxies, within, the, observable, universe, represent, only, a, minuscule, fraction, of, the, galaxies, in, the, universe, according, to, the, theory, of, cosmic, inflation, initially, introduced, by, alan, guth, and, d, kazanas, if, it, is, assumed, that, inflation, began, about, 10, 37, seconds, after, the, big, bang, and, that, the, pre, inflation, size, of, the, universe, was, approximately, equal, to, the, speed, of, light, times, its, age, that, would, suggest, that, at, present, the, entire, universe, s, size, is, at, least, 1, 5, 10, 34, light, years, at, least, 3, 10, 23, times, the, radius, of, the, observable, universe, if, the, universe, is, finite, but, unbounded, it, is, also, possible, that, the, universe, is, smaller, than, the, observable, universe, in, this, case, what, we, take, to, be, very, distant, galaxies, may, actually, be, duplicate, images, of, nearby, galaxies, formed, by, light, that, has, circumnavigated, the, universe, it, is, difficult, to, test, this, hypothesis, experimentally, because, different, images, of, a, galaxy, would, show, different, eras, in, its, history, and, consequently, might, appear, quite, different, bielewicz, et, al, claim, to, establish, a, lower, bound, of, 27, 9, gigaparsecs, 91, billion, light, years, on, the, diameter, of, the, last, scattering, surface, this, value, is, based, on, matching, circle, analysis, of, the, wmap, 7, year, data, this, approach, has, been, disputed, the, comoving, distance, from, earth, to, the, edge, of, the, observable, universe, is, about, 14, 26, giga, parsecs, 46, 5, billion, light, years, or, 4, 40, 10, 26, m, in, any, direction, the, observable, universe, is, thus, a, sphere, with, a, diameter, of, about, 28, 5, gigaparsecs, 93, billion, light, years, or, 8, 8, 10, 26, m, assuming, that, space, is, roughly, flat, in, the, sense, of, being, a, euclidean, space, this, size, corresponds, to, a, comoving, volume, of, about, 1, 22, 10, 4, gpc, 3, 4, 22, 10, 5, gly, 3, or, 3, 57, 10, 80, m, 3, these, are, distances, now, in, cosmological, time, not, distances, at, the, time, the, light, was, emitted, for, example, the, cosmic, microwave, background, radiation, that, we, see, right, now, was, emitted, at, the, time, of, photon, decoupling, estimated, to, have, occurred, about, 380, 000, years, after, the, big, bang, which, occurred, around, 13, 8, billion, years, ago, this, radiation, was, emitted, by, matter, that, has, in, the, intervening, time, mostly, condensed, into, galaxies, and, those, galaxies, are, now, calculated, to, be, about, 46, billion, light, years, from, earth, to, estimate, the, distance, to, that, matter, at, the, time, the, light, was, emitted, we, may, first, note, that, according, to, the, friedmann, lema, tre, robertson, walker, metric, which, is, used, to, model, the, expanding, universe, if, we, receive, light, with, a, redshift, of, z, then, the, scale, factor, at, the, time, the, light, was, originally, emitted, is, given, by, a, t, 1, 1, z, displaystyle, a, t, frac, 1, 1, z, wmap, nine, year, results, combined, with, other, measurements, give, the, redshift, of, photon, decoupling, as, z, 1, 091, 64, 0, 47, which, implies, that, the, scale, factor, at, the, time, of, photon, decoupling, would, be, 1, 1092, 64, so, if, the, matter, that, originally, emitted, the, oldest, cmbr, photons, has, a, present, distance, of, 46, billion, light, years, then, the, distance, would, have, been, only, about, 42, million, light, years, at, the, time, of, decoupling, the, light, travel, distance, to, the, edge, of, the, observable, universe, is, the, age, of, the, universe, times, the, speed, of, light, 13, 8, billion, light, years, this, is, the, distance, that, a, photon, emitted, shortly, after, the, big, bang, such, as, one, from, the, cosmic, microwave, background, has, traveled, to, reach, observers, on, earth, because, spacetime, is, curved, corresponding, to, the, expansion, of, space, this, distance, does, not, correspond, to, the, true, distance, at, any, moment, in, time, the, observable, universe, contains, as, many, as, an, estimated, 2, trillion, galaxies, and, overall, as, many, as, an, estimated, 10, 24, stars, more, stars, and, potentially, earth, like, planets, than, all, the, grains, of, beach, sand, on, planet, earth, as, mentioned, earlier, the, estimated, number, of, galaxies, was, reduced, in, 2021, to, several, hundred, billion, based, on, data, from, new, horizons, the, estimated, total, number, of, stars, in, an, inflationary, universe, observed, and, unobserved, is, 10, 100, assuming, the, mass, of, ordinary, matter, is, about, 1, 45, 10, 53, kg, as, discussed, above, and, assuming, all, atoms, are, hydrogen, atoms, which, are, about, 74, of, all, atoms, in, the, milky, way, by, mass, the, estimated, total, number, of, atoms, in, the, observable, universe, is, obtained, by, dividing, the, mass, of, ordinary, matter, by, the, mass, of, a, hydrogen, atom, the, result, is, approximately, 10, 80, hydrogen, atoms, also, known, as, the, eddington, number, the, mass, of, the, observable, universe, is, often, quoted, as, 10, 53, kg, in, this, context, mass, refers, to, ordinary, baryonic, matter, and, includes, the, interstellar, medium, ism, and, the, intergalactic, medium, igm, however, it, excludes, dark, matter, and, dark, energy, this, quoted, value, for, the, mass, of, ordinary, matter, in, the, universe, can, be, estimated, based, on, critical, density, the, calculations, are, for, the, observable, universe, only, as, the, volume, of, the, whole, is, unknown, and, may, be, infinite, critical, density, is, the, energy, density, for, which, the, universe, is, flat, if, there, is, no, dark, energy, it, is, also, the, density, for, which, the, expansion, of, the, universe, is, poised, between, continued, expansion, and, collapse, from, the, friedmann, equations, the, value, for, c, displaystyle, rho, text, c, critical, density, is, where, g, is, the, gravitational, constant, and, h, h, 0, is, the, present, value, of, the, hubble, constant, the, value, for, h, 0, as, given, by, the, european, space, agency, s, planck, telescope, is, h, 0, 67, 15, kilometres, per, second, per, megaparsec, this, gives, a, critical, density, of, 0, 85, 10, 26, kg, m, 3, or, about, 5, hydrogen, atoms, per, cubic, metre, this, density, includes, four, significant, types, of, energy, mass, ordinary, matter, 4, 8, neutrinos, 0, 1, cold, dark, matter, 26, 8, and, dark, energy, 68, 3, although, neutrinos, are, standard, model, particles, they, are, listed, separately, because, they, are, ultra, relativistic, and, hence, behave, like, radiation, rather, than, like, matter, the, density, of, ordinary, matter, as, measured, by, planck, is, 4, 8, of, the, total, critical, density, or, 4, 08, 10, 28, kg, m, 3, to, convert, this, density, to, mass, we, must, multiply, by, volume, a, value, based, on, the, radius, of, the, observable, universe, since, the, universe, has, been, expanding, for, 13, 8, billion, years, the, comoving, distance, radius, is, now, about, 46, 6, billion, light, years, thus, volume, 4, 3, r, 3, equals, 3, 58, 10, 80, m, 3, and, the, mass, of, ordinary, matter, equals, density, 4, 08, 10, 28, kg, m, 3, times, volume, 3, 58, 10, 80, m, 3, or, 1, 46, 10, 53, kg, sky, surveys, and, mappings, of, the, various, wavelength, bands, of, electromagnetic, radiation, in, particular, 21, cm, emission, have, yielded, much, information, on, the, content, and, character, of, the, universe, s, structure, the, organization, of, structure, appears, to, follow, a, hierarchical, model, with, organization, up, to, the, scale, of, superclusters, and, filaments, larger, than, this, at, scales, between, 30, and, 200, megaparsecs, there, seems, to, be, no, continued, structure, a, phenomenon, that, has, been, referred, to, as, the, end, of, greatness, the, organization, of, structure, arguably, begins, at, the, stellar, level, though, most, cosmologists, rarely, address, astrophysics, on, that, scale, stars, are, organized, into, galaxies, which, in, turn, form, galaxy, groups, galaxy, clusters, superclusters, sheets, walls, and, filaments, which, are, separated, by, immense, voids, creating, a, vast, foam, like, structure, sometimes, called, the, cosmic, web, prior, to, 1989, it, was, commonly, assumed, that, virialized, galaxy, clusters, were, the, largest, structures, in, existence, and, that, they, were, distributed, more, or, less, uniformly, throughout, the, universe, in, every, direction, however, since, the, early, 1980s, more, and, more, structures, have, been, discovered, in, 1983, adrian, webster, identified, the, webster, lqg, a, large, quasar, group, consisting, of, 5, quasars, the, discovery, was, the, first, identification, of, a, large, scale, structure, and, has, expanded, the, information, about, the, known, grouping, of, matter, in, the, universe, in, 1987, robert, brent, tully, identified, the, pisces, cetus, supercluster, complex, the, galaxy, filament, in, which, the, milky, way, resides, it, is, about, 1, billion, light, years, across, that, same, year, an, unusually, large, region, with, a, much, lower, than, average, distribution, of, galaxies, was, discovered, the, giant, void, which, measures, 1, 3, billion, light, years, across, based, on, redshift, survey, data, in, 1989, margaret, geller, and, john, huchra, discovered, the, great, wall, a, sheet, of, galaxies, more, than, 500, million, light, years, long, and, 200, million, light, years, wide, but, only, 15, million, light, years, thick, the, existence, of, this, structure, escaped, notice, for, so, long, because, it, requires, locating, the, position, of, galaxies, in, three, dimensions, which, involves, combining, location, information, about, the, galaxies, with, distance, information, from, redshifts, two, years, later, astronomers, roger, g, clowes, and, luis, e, campusano, discovered, the, clowes, campusano, lqg, a, large, quasar, group, measuring, two, billion, light, years, at, its, widest, point, which, was, the, largest, known, structure, in, the, universe, at, the, time, of, its, announcement, in, april, 2003, another, large, scale, structure, was, discovered, the, sloan, great, wall, in, august, 2007, a, possible, supervoid, was, detected, in, the, constellation, eridanus, it, coincides, with, the, cmb, cold, spot, a, cold, region, in, the, microwave, sky, that, is, highly, improbable, under, the, currently, favored, cosmological, model, this, supervoid, could, cause, the, cold, spot, but, to, do, so, it, would, have, to, be, improbably, big, possibly, a, billion, light, years, across, almost, as, big, as, the, giant, void, mentioned, above, another, large, scale, structure, is, the, ssa22, protocluster, a, collection, of, galaxies, and, enormous, gas, bubbles, that, measures, about, 200, million, light, years, across, in, 2011, a, large, quasar, group, was, discovered, u1, 11, measuring, about, 2, 5, billion, light, years, across, on, january, 11, 2013, another, large, quasar, group, the, huge, lqg, was, discovered, which, was, measured, to, be, four, billion, light, years, across, the, largest, known, structure, in, the, universe, at, that, time, in, november, 2013, astronomers, discovered, the, hercules, corona, borealis, great, wall, an, even, bigger, structure, twice, as, large, as, the, former, it, was, defined, by, the, mapping, of, gamma, ray, bursts, in, 2021, the, american, astronomical, society, announced, the, detection, of, the, giant, arc, a, crescent, shaped, string, of, galaxies, that, span, 3, 3, billion, light, years, in, length, located, 9, 2, billion, light, years, from, earth, in, the, constellation, bo, tes, from, observations, captured, by, the, sloan, digital, sky, survey, the, end, of, greatness, is, an, observational, scale, discovered, at, roughly, 100, mpc, roughly, 300, million, light, years, where, the, lumpiness, seen, in, the, large, scale, structure, of, the, universe, is, homogenized, and, isotropized, in, accordance, with, the, cosmological, principle, at, this, scale, no, pseudo, random, fractalness, is, apparent, the, superclusters, and, filaments, seen, in, smaller, surveys, are, randomized, to, the, extent, that, the, smooth, distribution, of, the, universe, is, visually, apparent, it, was, not, until, the, redshift, surveys, of, the, 1990s, were, completed, that, this, scale, could, accurately, be, observed, another, indicator, of, large, scale, structure, is, the, lyman, alpha, forest, this, is, a, collection, of, absorption, lines, that, appear, in, the, spectra, of, light, from, quasars, which, are, interpreted, as, indicating, the, existence, of, huge, thin, sheets, of, intergalactic, mostly, hydrogen, gas, these, sheets, appear, to, collapse, into, filaments, which, can, feed, galaxies, as, they, grow, where, filaments, either, cross, or, are, dense, an, early, direct, evidence, for, this, cosmic, web, of, gas, was, the, 2019, detection, by, astronomers, from, the, riken, cluster, for, pioneering, research, in, japan, and, durham, university, in, the, u, k, of, light, from, the, brightest, part, of, this, web, surrounding, and, illuminated, by, a, cluster, of, forming, galaxies, acting, as, cosmic, flashlights, for, intercluster, medium, hydrogen, fluorescence, via, lyman, alpha, emissions, in, 2021, an, international, team, headed, by, roland, bacon, from, the, centre, de, recherche, astrophysique, de, lyon, france, reported, the, first, observation, of, diffuse, extended, lyman, alpha, emission, from, redshift, 3, 1, to, 4, 5, that, traced, several, cosmic, web, filaments, on, scales, of, 2, 5, 4, cmpc, comoving, mega, parsecs, in, filamentary, environments, outside, massive, structures, typical, of, web, nodes, some, caution, is, required, in, describing, structures, on, a, cosmic, scale, because, they, are, often, different, from, how, they, appear, gravitational, lensing, can, make, an, image, appear, to, originate, in, a, different, direction, from, its, real, source, when, foreground, objects, curve, surrounding, spacetime, as, predicted, by, general, relativity, and, deflect, passing, light, rays, rather, usefully, strong, gravitational, lensing, can, sometimes, magnify, distant, galaxies, making, them, easier, to, detect, weak, lensing, by, the, intervening, universe, in, general, also, subtly, changes, the, observed, large, scale, structure, the, large, scale, structure, of, the, universe, also, looks, different, if, only, redshift, is, used, to, measure, distances, to, galaxies, for, example, galaxies, behind, a, galaxy, cluster, are, attracted, to, it, and, fall, towards, it, and, so, are, blueshifted, compared, to, how, they, would, be, if, there, were, no, cluster, on, the, near, side, objects, are, redshifted, thus, the, environment, of, the, cluster, looks, somewhat, pinched, if, using, redshifts, to, measure, distance, the, opposite, effect, is, observed, on, galaxies, already, within, a, cluster, the, galaxies, have, some, random, motion, around, the, cluster, center, and, when, these, random, motions, are, converted, to, redshifts, the, cluster, appears, elongated, this, creates, a, finger, of, god, the, illusion, of, a, long, chain, of, galaxies, pointed, at, earth, at, the, centre, of, the, hydra, centaurus, supercluster, a, gravitational, anomaly, called, the, great, attractor, affects, the, motion, of, galaxies, over, a, region, hundreds, of, millions, of, light, years, across, these, galaxies, are, all, redshifted, in, accordance, with, hubble, s, law, this, indicates, that, they, are, receding, from, us, and, from, each, other, but, the, variations, in, their, redshift, are, sufficient, to, reveal, the, existence, of, a, concentration, of, mass, equivalent, to, tens, of, thousands, of, galaxies, the, great, attractor, discovered, in, 1986, lies, at, a, distance, of, between, 150, million, and, 250, million, light, years, in, the, direction, of, the, hydra, and, centaurus, constellations, in, its, vicinity, there, is, a, preponderance, of, large, old, galaxies, many, of, which, are, colliding, with, their, neighbours, or, radiating, large, amounts, of, radio, waves, in, 1987, astronomer, r, brent, tully, of, the, university, of, hawaii, s, institute, of, astronomy, identified, what, he, called, the, pisces, cetus, supercluster, complex, a, structure, one, billion, light, years, long, and, 150, million, light, years, across, in, which, he, claimed, the, local, supercluster, is, embedded, the, most, distant, astronomical, object, identified, as, of, august, of, 2024, is, a, galaxy, classified, as, jades, gs, z14, 0, in, 2009, a, gamma, ray, burst, grb, 090423, was, found, to, have, a, redshift, of, 8, 2, which, indicates, that, the, collapsing, star, that, caused, it, exploded, when, the, universe, was, only, 630, million, years, old, the, burst, happened, approximately, 13, billion, years, ago, so, a, distance, of, about, 13, billion, light, years, was, widely, quoted, in, the, media, or, sometimes, a, more, precise, figure, of, 13, 035, billion, light, years, this, would, be, the, light, travel, distance, see, distance, measures, cosmology, rather, than, the, proper, distance, used, in, both, hubble, s, law, and, in, defining, the, size, of, the, observable, universe, cosmologist, ned, wright, argues, against, using, this, measure, the, proper, distance, for, a, redshift, of, 8, 2, would, be, about, 9, 2, gpc, or, about, 30, billion, light, years, the, limit, of, observability, in, the, universe, is, set, by, cosmological, horizons, which, limit, based, on, various, physical, constraints, the, extent, to, which, information, can, be, obtained, about, various, events, in, the, universe, the, most, famous, horizon, is, the, particle, horizon, which, sets, a, limit, on, the, precise, distance, that, can, be, seen, due, to, the, finite, age, of, the, universe, additional, horizons, are, associated, with, the, possible, future, extent, of, observations, larger, than, the, particle, horizon, owing, to, the, expansion, of, space, an, optical, horizon, at, the, surface, of, last, scattering, and, associated, horizons, with, the, surface, of, last, scattering, for, neutrinos, and, gravitational, waves
