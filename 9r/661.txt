a, mid, ocean, ridge, mor, is, a, seafloor, mountain, system, formed, by, plate, tectonics, it, typically, has, a, depth, of, about, 2, 600, meters, 8, 500, ft, and, rises, about, 2, 000, meters, 6, 600, ft, above, the, deepest, portion, of, an, ocean, basin, this, feature, is, where, seafloor, spreading, takes, place, along, a, divergent, plate, boundary, the, rate, of, seafloor, spreading, determines, the, morphology, of, the, crest, of, the, mid, ocean, ridge, and, its, width, in, an, ocean, basin, the, production, of, new, seafloor, and, oceanic, lithosphere, results, from, mantle, upwelling, in, response, to, plate, separation, the, melt, rises, as, magma, at, the, linear, weakness, between, the, separating, plates, and, emerges, as, lava, creating, new, oceanic, crust, and, lithosphere, upon, cooling, the, first, discovered, mid, ocean, ridge, was, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, which, is, a, spreading, center, that, bisects, the, north, and, south, atlantic, basins, hence, the, origin, of, the, name, mid, ocean, ridge, most, oceanic, spreading, centers, are, not, in, the, middle, of, their, hosting, ocean, basis, but, regardless, are, traditionally, called, mid, ocean, ridges, mid, ocean, ridges, around, the, globe, are, linked, by, plate, tectonic, boundaries, and, the, trace, of, the, ridges, across, the, ocean, floor, appears, similar, to, the, seam, of, a, baseball, the, mid, ocean, ridge, system, thus, is, the, longest, mountain, range, on, earth, reaching, about, 65, 000, km, 40, 000, mi, the, mid, ocean, ridges, of, the, world, are, connected, and, form, the, ocean, ridge, a, single, global, mid, oceanic, ridge, system, that, is, part, of, every, ocean, making, it, the, longest, mountain, range, in, the, world, the, continuous, mountain, range, is, 65, 000, km, 40, 400, mi, long, several, times, longer, than, the, andes, the, longest, continental, mountain, range, and, the, total, length, of, the, oceanic, ridge, system, is, 80, 000, km, 49, 700, mi, long, at, the, spreading, center, on, a, mid, ocean, ridge, the, depth, of, the, seafloor, is, approximately, 2, 600, meters, 8, 500, ft, on, the, ridge, flanks, the, depth, of, the, seafloor, or, the, height, of, a, location, on, a, mid, ocean, ridge, above, a, base, level, is, correlated, with, its, age, age, of, the, lithosphere, where, depth, is, measured, the, depth, age, relation, can, be, modeled, by, the, cooling, of, a, lithosphere, plate, or, mantle, half, space, a, good, approximation, is, that, the, depth, of, the, seafloor, at, a, location, on, a, spreading, mid, ocean, ridge, is, proportional, to, the, square, root, of, the, age, of, the, seafloor, the, overall, shape, of, ridges, results, from, pratt, isostasy, close, to, the, ridge, axis, there, is, a, hot, low, density, mantle, supporting, the, oceanic, crust, as, the, oceanic, plate, cools, away, from, the, ridge, axis, the, oceanic, mantle, lithosphere, the, colder, denser, part, of, the, mantle, that, together, with, the, crust, comprises, the, oceanic, plates, thickens, and, the, density, increases, thus, older, seafloor, is, underlain, by, denser, material, and, is, deeper, spreading, rate, is, the, rate, at, which, an, ocean, basin, widens, due, to, seafloor, spreading, rates, can, be, computed, by, mapping, marine, magnetic, anomalies, that, span, mid, ocean, ridges, as, crystallized, basalt, extruded, at, a, ridge, axis, cools, below, curie, points, of, appropriate, iron, titanium, oxides, magnetic, field, directions, parallel, to, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, are, recorded, in, those, oxides, the, orientations, of, the, field, preserved, in, the, oceanic, crust, comprise, a, record, of, directions, of, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, with, time, because, the, field, has, reversed, directions, at, known, intervals, throughout, its, history, the, pattern, of, geomagnetic, reversals, in, the, ocean, crust, can, be, used, as, an, indicator, of, age, given, the, crustal, age, and, distance, from, the, ridge, axis, spreading, rates, can, be, calculated, spreading, rates, range, from, approximately, 10, 200, mm, yr, slow, spreading, ridges, such, as, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, have, spread, much, less, far, showing, a, steeper, profile, than, faster, ridges, such, as, the, east, pacific, rise, gentle, profile, for, the, same, amount, of, time, and, cooling, and, consequent, bathymetric, deepening, slow, spreading, ridges, less, than, 40, mm, yr, generally, have, large, rift, valleys, sometimes, as, wide, as, 10, 20, km, 6, 2, 12, 4, mi, and, very, rugged, terrain, at, the, ridge, crest, that, can, have, relief, of, up, to, 1, 000, m, 3, 300, ft, by, contrast, fast, spreading, ridges, greater, than, 90, mm, yr, such, as, the, east, pacific, rise, lack, rift, valleys, the, spreading, rate, of, the, north, atlantic, ocean, is, 25, mm, yr, while, in, the, pacific, region, it, is, 80, 145, mm, yr, the, highest, known, rate, is, over, 200, mm, yr, in, the, miocene, on, the, east, pacific, rise, ridges, that, spread, at, rates, 20, mm, yr, are, referred, to, as, ultraslow, spreading, ridges, e, g, the, gakkel, ridge, in, the, arctic, ocean, and, the, southwest, indian, ridge, the, spreading, center, or, axis, commonly, connects, to, a, transform, fault, oriented, at, right, angles, to, the, axis, the, flanks, of, mid, ocean, ridges, are, in, many, places, marked, by, the, inactive, scars, of, transform, faults, called, fracture, zones, at, faster, spreading, rates, the, axes, often, display, overlapping, spreading, centers, that, lack, connecting, transform, faults, the, depth, of, the, axis, changes, in, a, systematic, way, with, shallower, depths, between, offsets, such, as, transform, faults, and, overlapping, spreading, centers, dividing, the, axis, into, segments, one, hypothesis, for, different, along, axis, depths, is, variations, in, magma, supply, to, the, spreading, center, ultra, slow, spreading, ridges, form, both, magmatic, and, amagmatic, currently, lack, volcanic, activity, ridge, segments, without, transform, faults, mid, ocean, ridges, exhibit, active, volcanism, and, seismicity, the, oceanic, crust, is, in, a, constant, state, of, renewal, at, the, mid, ocean, ridges, by, the, processes, of, seafloor, spreading, and, plate, tectonics, new, magma, steadily, emerges, onto, the, ocean, floor, and, intrudes, into, the, existing, ocean, crust, at, and, near, rifts, along, the, ridge, axes, the, rocks, making, up, the, crust, below, the, seafloor, are, youngest, along, the, axis, of, the, ridge, and, age, with, increasing, distance, from, that, axis, new, magma, of, basalt, composition, emerges, at, and, near, the, axis, because, of, decompression, melting, in, the, underlying, earth, s, mantle, the, isentropic, upwelling, solid, mantle, material, exceeds, the, solidus, temperature, and, melts, the, crystallized, magma, forms, a, new, crust, of, basalt, known, as, morb, for, mid, ocean, ridge, basalt, and, gabbro, below, it, in, the, lower, oceanic, crust, mid, ocean, ridge, basalt, is, a, tholeiitic, basalt, and, is, low, in, incompatible, elements, hydrothermal, vents, fueled, by, magmatic, and, volcanic, heat, are, a, common, feature, at, oceanic, spreading, centers, a, feature, of, the, elevated, ridges, is, their, relatively, high, heat, flow, values, of, about, 1, 10, cal, cm, 2, s, or, roughly, 0, 04, 0, 4, w, m, 2, most, crust, in, the, ocean, basins, is, less, than, 200, million, years, old, which, is, much, younger, than, the, 4, 54, billion, year, age, of, earth, this, fact, reflects, the, process, of, lithosphere, recycling, into, the, earth, s, mantle, during, subduction, as, the, oceanic, crust, and, lithosphere, moves, away, from, the, ridge, axis, the, peridotite, in, the, underlying, mantle, lithosphere, cools, and, becomes, more, rigid, the, crust, and, the, relatively, rigid, peridotite, below, it, make, up, the, oceanic, lithosphere, which, sits, above, the, less, rigid, and, viscous, asthenosphere, the, oceanic, lithosphere, is, formed, at, an, oceanic, ridge, while, the, lithosphere, is, subducted, back, into, the, asthenosphere, at, ocean, trenches, two, processes, ridge, push, and, slab, pull, are, thought, to, be, responsible, for, spreading, at, mid, ocean, ridges, ridge, push, refers, to, the, gravitational, sliding, of, the, ocean, plate, that, is, raised, above, the, hotter, asthenosphere, thus, creating, a, body, force, causing, sliding, of, the, plate, downslope, in, slab, pull, the, weight, of, a, tectonic, plate, being, subducted, pulled, below, an, overlying, plate, at, a, subduction, zone, drags, the, rest, of, the, plate, along, behind, it, the, slab, pull, mechanism, is, considered, to, be, contributing, more, than, the, ridge, push, a, process, previously, proposed, to, contribute, to, plate, motion, and, the, formation, of, new, oceanic, crust, at, mid, ocean, ridges, is, the, mantle, conveyor, due, to, deep, convection, see, image, however, some, studies, have, shown, that, the, upper, mantle, asthenosphere, is, too, plastic, flexible, to, generate, enough, friction, to, pull, the, tectonic, plate, along, moreover, mantle, upwelling, that, causes, magma, to, form, beneath, the, ocean, ridges, appears, to, involve, only, its, upper, 400, km, 250, mi, as, deduced, from, seismic, tomography, and, observations, of, the, seismic, discontinuity, in, the, upper, mantle, at, about, 400, km, 250, mi, on, the, other, hand, some, of, the, world, s, largest, tectonic, plates, such, as, the, north, american, plate, and, south, american, plate, are, in, motion, yet, only, are, being, subducted, in, restricted, locations, such, as, the, lesser, antilles, arc, and, scotia, arc, pointing, to, action, by, the, ridge, push, body, force, on, these, plates, computer, modeling, of, the, plates, and, mantle, motions, suggest, that, plate, motion, and, mantle, convection, are, not, connected, and, the, main, plate, driving, force, is, slab, pull, increased, rates, of, seafloor, spreading, i, e, the, rate, of, expansion, of, the, mid, ocean, ridge, have, caused, the, global, eustatic, sea, level, to, rise, over, very, long, timescales, millions, of, years, increased, seafloor, spreading, means, that, the, mid, ocean, ridge, will, then, expand, and, form, a, broader, ridge, with, decreased, average, depth, taking, up, more, space, in, the, ocean, basin, this, displaces, the, overlying, ocean, and, causes, sea, levels, to, rise, sealevel, change, can, be, attributed, to, other, factors, thermal, expansion, ice, melting, and, mantle, convection, creating, dynamic, topography, over, very, long, timescales, however, it, is, the, result, of, changes, in, the, volume, of, the, ocean, basins, which, are, in, turn, affected, by, rates, of, seafloor, spreading, along, the, mid, ocean, ridges, the, 100, to, 170, meters, higher, sea, level, of, the, cretaceous, period, 144, 65, ma, is, partly, attributed, to, plate, tectonics, because, thermal, expansion, and, the, absence, of, ice, sheets, only, account, for, some, of, the, extra, sea, level, seafloor, spreading, on, mid, ocean, ridges, is, a, global, scale, ion, exchange, system, hydrothermal, vents, at, spreading, centers, introduce, various, amounts, of, iron, sulfur, manganese, silicon, and, other, elements, into, the, ocean, some, of, which, are, recycled, into, the, ocean, crust, helium, 3, an, isotope, that, accompanies, volcanism, from, the, mantle, is, emitted, by, hydrothermal, vents, and, can, be, detected, in, plumes, within, the, ocean, fast, spreading, rates, will, expand, the, mid, ocean, ridge, causing, basalt, reactions, with, seawater, to, happen, more, rapidly, the, magnesium, calcium, ratio, will, be, lower, because, more, magnesium, ions, are, being, removed, from, seawater, and, consumed, by, the, rock, and, more, calcium, ions, are, being, removed, from, the, rock, and, released, into, seawater, hydrothermal, activity, at, the, ridge, crest, is, efficient, in, removing, magnesium, a, lower, mg, ca, ratio, favors, the, precipitation, of, low, mg, calcite, polymorphs, of, calcium, carbonate, calcite, seas, slow, spreading, at, mid, ocean, ridges, has, the, opposite, effect, and, will, result, in, a, higher, mg, ca, ratio, favoring, the, precipitation, of, aragonite, and, high, mg, calcite, polymorphs, of, calcium, carbonate, aragonite, seas, experiments, show, that, most, modern, high, mg, calcite, organisms, would, have, been, low, mg, calcite, in, past, calcite, seas, meaning, that, the, mg, ca, ratio, in, an, organism, s, skeleton, varies, with, the, mg, ca, ratio, of, the, seawater, in, which, it, was, grown, the, mineralogy, of, reef, building, and, sediment, producing, organisms, is, thus, regulated, by, chemical, reactions, occurring, along, the, mid, ocean, ridge, the, rate, of, which, is, controlled, by, the, rate, of, sea, floor, spreading, the, first, indications, that, a, ridge, bisects, the, atlantic, ocean, basin, came, from, the, results, of, the, british, challenger, expedition, in, the, nineteenth, century, soundings, from, lines, dropped, to, the, seafloor, were, analyzed, by, oceanographers, matthew, fontaine, maury, and, charles, wyville, thomson, and, revealed, a, prominent, rise, in, the, seafloor, that, ran, down, the, atlantic, basin, from, north, to, south, sonar, echo, sounders, confirmed, this, in, the, early, twentieth, century, it, was, not, until, after, world, war, ii, when, the, ocean, floor, was, surveyed, in, more, detail, that, the, full, extent, of, mid, ocean, ridges, became, known, the, vema, a, ship, of, the, lamont, doherty, earth, observatory, of, columbia, university, traversed, the, atlantic, ocean, recording, echo, sounder, data, on, the, depth, of, the, ocean, floor, a, team, led, by, marie, tharp, and, bruce, heezen, concluded, that, there, was, an, enormous, mountain, chain, with, a, rift, valley, at, its, crest, running, up, the, middle, of, the, atlantic, ocean, scientists, named, it, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, other, research, showed, that, the, ridge, crest, was, seismically, active, and, fresh, lavas, were, found, in, the, rift, valley, also, crustal, heat, flow, was, higher, here, than, elsewhere, in, the, atlantic, ocean, basin, at, first, the, ridge, was, thought, to, be, a, feature, specific, to, the, atlantic, ocean, however, as, surveys, of, the, ocean, floor, continued, around, the, world, it, was, discovered, that, every, ocean, contains, parts, of, the, mid, ocean, ridge, system, the, german, meteor, expedition, traced, the, mid, ocean, ridge, from, the, south, atlantic, into, the, indian, ocean, early, in, the, twentieth, century, although, the, first, discovered, section, of, the, ridge, system, runs, down, the, middle, of, the, atlantic, ocean, it, was, found, that, most, mid, ocean, ridges, are, located, away, from, the, center, of, other, ocean, basins, alfred, wegener, proposed, the, theory, of, continental, drift, in, 1912, he, stated, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, zone, in, which, the, floor, of, the, atlantic, as, it, keeps, spreading, is, continuously, tearing, open, and, making, space, for, fresh, relatively, fluid, and, hot, sima, from, depth, however, wegener, did, not, pursue, this, observation, in, his, later, works, and, his, theory, was, dismissed, by, geologists, because, there, was, no, mechanism, to, explain, how, continents, could, plow, through, ocean, crust, and, the, theory, became, largely, forgotten, following, the, discovery, of, the, worldwide, extent, of, the, mid, ocean, ridge, in, the, 1950s, geologists, faced, a, new, task, explaining, how, such, an, enormous, geological, structure, could, have, formed, in, the, 1960s, geologists, discovered, and, began, to, propose, mechanisms, for, seafloor, spreading, the, discovery, of, mid, ocean, ridges, and, the, process, of, seafloor, spreading, allowed, for, wegener, s, theory, to, be, expanded, so, that, it, included, the, movement, of, oceanic, crust, as, well, as, the, continents, plate, tectonics, was, a, suitable, explanation, for, seafloor, spreading, and, the, acceptance, of, plate, tectonics, by, the, majority, of, geologists, resulted, in, a, major, paradigm, shift, in, geological, thinking, it, is, estimated, that, along, earth, s, mid, ocean, ridges, every, year, 2, 7, km, 2, 1, 0, sq, mi, of, new, seafloor, is, formed, by, this, process, with, a, crustal, thickness, of, 7, km, 4, 3, mi, this, amounts, to, about, 19, km, 3, 4, 6, cu, mi, of, new, ocean, crust, formed, every, year
