selenium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, the, symbol, se, and, atomic, number, 34, it, has, various, physical, appearances, including, a, brick, red, powder, a, vitreous, black, solid, and, a, grey, metallic, looking, form, it, seldom, occurs, in, this, elemental, state, or, as, pure, ore, compounds, in, earth, s, crust, selenium, from, ancient, greek, sel, n, moon, was, discovered, in, 1817, by, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, who, noted, the, similarity, of, the, new, element, to, the, previously, discovered, tellurium, named, for, the, earth, selenium, is, found, in, metal, sulfide, ores, where, it, substitutes, for, sulfur, commercially, selenium, is, produced, as, a, byproduct, in, the, refining, of, these, ores, minerals, that, are, pure, selenide, or, selenate, compounds, are, rare, the, chief, commercial, uses, for, selenium, today, are, glassmaking, and, pigments, selenium, is, a, semiconductor, and, is, used, in, photocells, applications, in, electronics, once, important, have, been, mostly, replaced, with, silicon, semiconductor, devices, selenium, is, still, used, in, a, few, types, of, dc, power, surge, protectors, and, one, type, of, fluorescent, quantum, dot, although, trace, amounts, of, selenium, are, necessary, for, cellular, function, in, many, animals, including, humans, both, elemental, selenium, and, especially, selenium, salts, are, toxic, in, even, small, doses, causing, selenosis, selenium, is, listed, as, an, ingredient, in, many, multivitamins, and, other, dietary, supplements, as, well, as, in, infant, formula, and, is, a, component, of, the, antioxidant, enzymes, glutathione, peroxidase, and, thioredoxin, reductase, which, indirectly, reduce, certain, oxidized, molecules, in, animals, and, some, plants, as, well, as, in, three, deiodinase, enzymes, selenium, requirements, in, plants, differ, by, species, with, some, plants, requiring, relatively, large, amounts, and, others, apparently, not, requiring, any, selenium, forms, several, allotropes, that, interconvert, with, temperature, changes, depending, somewhat, on, the, rate, of, temperature, change, when, prepared, in, chemical, reactions, selenium, is, usually, an, amorphous, brick, red, powder, when, rapidly, melted, it, forms, the, black, vitreous, form, usually, sold, commercially, as, beads, the, structure, of, black, selenium, is,

consistent, with, trends, indicated, by, the, double, bond, rule, selenoketones, r, c, se, r, and, selenaldehydes, r, c, se, h, are, rarely, observed, selenium, greek, selene, meaning, moon, was, discovered, in, 1817, by, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, and, johan, gottlieb, gahn, both, chemists, owned, a, chemistry, plant, near, gripsholm, sweden, producing, sulfuric, acid, by, the, lead, chamber, process, pyrite, samples, from, the, falun, mine, produced, a, red, solid, precipitate, in, the, lead, chambers, which, was, presumed, to, be, an, arsenic, compound, so, the, use, of, pyrite, to, make, acid, was, discontinued, berzelius, and, gahn, who, wanted, to, use, the, pyrite, observed, that, the, red, precipitate, gave, off, an, odor, like, horseradish, when, burned, this, smell, was, not, typical, of, arsenic, but, a, similar, odor, was, known, from, tellurium, compounds, hence, berzelius, s, first, letter, to, alexander, marcet, stated, that, this, was, a, tellurium, compound, however, the, lack, of, tellurium, compounds, in, the, falun, mine, minerals, eventually, led, berzelius, to, reanalyze, the, red, precipitate, and, in, 1818, he, wrote, a, second, letter, to, marcet, describing, a, newly, found, element, similar, to, sulfur, and, tellurium, because, of, its, similarity, to, tellurium, named, for, the, earth, berzelius, named, the, new, element, after, the, moon, in, 1873, willoughby, smith, found, that, the, electrical, conductivity, of, grey, selenium, was, affected, by, light, this, led, to, its, use, as, a, cell, for, sensing, light, the, first, commercial, products, using, selenium, were, developed, by, werner, siemens, in, the, mid, 1870s, the, selenium, cell, was, used, in, the, photophone, developed, by, alexander, graham, bell, in, 1879, selenium, transmits, an, electric, current, proportional, to, the, amount, of, light, falling, on, its, surface, this, phenomenon, was, used, in, the, design, of, light, meters, and, similar, devices, selenium, s, semiconductor, properties, found, numerous, other, applications, in, electronics, the, development, of, selenium, rectifiers, began, during, the, early, 1930s, and, these, replaced, copper, oxide, rectifiers, because, they, were, more, efficient, these, lasted, in, commercial, applications, until, the, 1970s, following, which, they, were, replaced, with, less, expensive, and, even, more, efficient, silicon, rectifiers, selenium, came, to, medical, notice, later, because, of, its, toxicity, to, industrial, workers, selenium, was, also, recognized, as, an, important, veterinary, toxin, which, is, seen, in, animals, that, have, eaten, high, selenium, plants, in, 1954, the, first, hints, of, specific, biological, functions, of, selenium, were, discovered, in, microorganisms, by, biochemist, jane, pinsent, it, was, discovered, to, be, essential, for, mammalian, life, in, 1957, in, the, 1970s, it, was, shown, to, be, present, in, two, independent, sets, of, enzymes, this, was, followed, by, the, discovery, of, selenocysteine, in, proteins, during, the, 1980s, selenocysteine, was, shown, to, be, encoded, by, the, codon, uga, the, recoding, mechanism, was, worked, out, first, in, bacteria, and, then, in, mammals, see, secis, element, native, i, e, elemental, selenium, is, a, rare, mineral, which, does, not, usually, form, good, crystals, but, when, it, does, they, are, steep, rhombohedra, or, tiny, acicular, hair, like, crystals, isolation, of, selenium, is, often, complicated, by, the, presence, of, other, compounds, and, elements, selenium, occurs, naturally, in, a, number, of, inorganic, forms, including, selenide, selenate, and, selenite, but, these, minerals, are, rare, the, common, mineral, selenite, is, not, a, selenium, mineral, and, contains, no, selenite, ion, but, is, rather, a, type, of, gypsum, calcium, sulfate, hydrate, named, like, selenium, for, the, moon, well, before, the, discovery, of, selenium, selenium, is, most, commonly, found, as, an, impurity, replacing, a, small, part, of, the, sulfur, in, sulfide, ores, of, many, metals, in, living, systems, selenium, is, found, in, the, amino, acids, selenomethionine, selenocysteine, and, methylselenocysteine, in, these, compounds, selenium, plays, a, role, analogous, to, that, of, sulfur, another, naturally, occurring, organoselenium, compound, is, dimethyl, selenide, certain, soils, are, selenium, rich, and, selenium, can, be, bioconcentrated, by, some, plants, in, soils, selenium, most, often, occurs, in, soluble, forms, such, as, selenate, analogous, to, sulfate, which, are, leached, into, rivers, very, easily, by, runoff, ocean, water, contains, significant, amounts, of, selenium, typical, background, concentrations, of, selenium, do, not, exceed, 1, ng, m, 3, in, the, atmosphere, 1, mg, kg, in, soil, and, vegetation, and, 0, 5, g, l, in, freshwater, and, seawater, anthropogenic, sources, of, selenium, include, coal, burning, and, the, mining, and, smelting, of, sulfide, ores, selenium, is, most, commonly, produced, from, selenide, in, many, sulfide, ores, such, as, those, of, copper, nickel, or, lead, electrolytic, metal, refining, is, particularly, productive, of, selenium, as, a, byproduct, obtained, from, the, anode, mud, of, copper, refineries, another, source, was, the, mud, from, the, lead, chambers, of, sulfuric, acid, plants, a, process, that, is, no, longer, used, selenium, can, be, refined, from, these, muds, by, a, number, of, methods, however, most, elemental, selenium, comes, as, a, byproduct, of, refining, copper, or, producing, sulfuric, acid, since, its, invention, solvent, extraction, and, electrowinning, sx, ew, production, of, copper, produces, an, increasing, share, of, the, worldwide, copper, supply, this, changes, the, availability, of, selenium, because, only, a, comparably, small, part, of, the, selenium, in, the, ore, is, leached, with, the, copper, industrial, production, of, selenium, usually, involves, the, extraction, of, selenium, dioxide, from, residues, obtained, during, the, purification, of, copper, common, production, from, the, residue, then, begins, by, oxidation, with, sodium, carbonate, to, produce, selenium, dioxide, which, is, mixed, with, water, and, acidified, to, form, selenous, acid, oxidation, step, selenous, acid, is, bubbled, with, sulfur, dioxide, reduction, step, to, give, elemental, selenium, about, 2, 000, tonnes, of, selenium, were, produced, in, 2011, worldwide, mostly, in, germany, 650, t, japan, 630, t, belgium, 200, t, and, russia, 140, t, and, the, total, reserves, were, estimated, at, 93, 000, tonnes, these, data, exclude, two, major, producers, the, united, states, and, china, a, previous, sharp, increase, was, observed, in, 2004, from, 4, 5, to, 27, lb, the, price, was, relatively, stable, during, 2004, 2010, at, about, us, 30, per, pound, in, 100, pound, lots, but, increased, to, 65, lb, in, 2011, the, consumption, in, 2010, was, divided, as, follows, metallurgy, 30, glass, manufacturing, 30, agriculture, 10, chemicals, and, pigments, 10, and, electronics, 10, china, is, the, dominant, consumer, of, selenium, at, 1, 500, 2, 000, tonnes, year, during, the, electrowinning, of, manganese, the, addition, of, selenium, dioxide, decreases, the, power, necessary, to, operate, the, electrolysis, cells, china, is, the, largest, consumer, of, selenium, dioxide, for, this, purpose, for, every, tonne, of, manganese, an, average, 2, kg, selenium, oxide, is, used, the, largest, commercial, use, of, selenium, accounting, for, about, 50, of, consumption, is, for, the, production, of, glass, selenium, compounds, confer, a, red, color, to, glass, this, color, cancels, out, the, green, or, yellow, tints, that, arise, from, iron, impurities, typical, for, most, glass, for, this, purpose, various, selenite, and, selenate, salts, are, added, for, other, applications, a, red, color, may, be, desired, produced, by, mixtures, of, cdse, and, cds, selenium, is, used, with, bismuth, in, brasses, to, replace, more, toxic, lead, the, regulation, of, lead, in, drinking, water, applications, such, as, in, the, us, with, the, safe, drinking, water, act, of, 1974, made, a, reduction, of, lead, in, brass, necessary, the, new, brass, is, marketed, under, the, name, envirobrass, like, lead, and, sulfur, selenium, improves, the, machinability, of, steel, at, concentrations, around, 0, 15, selenium, produces, the, same, machinability, improvement, in, copper, alloys, the, lithium, selenium, li, se, battery, is, one, of, the, most, promising, systems, for, energy, storage, in, the, family, of, lithium, batteries, the, li, se, battery, is, an, alternative, to, the, lithium, sulfur, battery, with, an, advantage, of, high, electrical, conductivity, selenium, was, used, as, the, photoabsoring, layer, in, the, first, solid, state, solar, cell, which, was, demonstrated, by, the, english, physicist, william, grylls, adams, and, his, student, richard, evans, day, in, 1876, only, a, few, years, layer, charles, fritts, fabricated, the, first, thin, film, solar, cell, also, using, selenium, as, the, photoabsorber, however, with, the, emergence, of, silicon, solar, cells, in, the, 1950s, research, on, selenium, thin, film, solar, cells, declined, as, a, result, the, record, efficiency, of, 5, 0, demonstrated, by, tokio, nakada, and, akio, kunioka, in, 1985, remained, unchanged, for, more, than, 30, years, in, 2017, researchers, from, ibm, achieved, a, new, record, efficiency, of, 6, 5, by, redesigning, the, device, structure, following, this, achievement, selenium, has, gained, renewed, interest, as, a, wide, bandgap, photoabsorber, with, the, potential, of, being, integrated, in, tandem, with, lower, bandgap, photoabsorbers, in, 2024, the, first, selenium, based, tandem, solar, cell, was, demonstrated, showcasing, a, selenium, top, cell, monolithically, integrated, with, a, silicon, bottom, cell, however, a, significant, deficit, in, the, open, circuit, voltage, is, currently, the, main, limiting, factor, to, further, improve, the, efficiency, necessitating, defect, engineering, strategies, for, selenium, thin, films, to, enhance, the, carrier, lifetime, as, of, now, the, only, defect, engineering, strategy, that, has, been, investigated, for, selenium, thin, film, solar, cells, involves, crystallizing, selenium, using, a, laser, amorphous, selenium, se, thin, films, have, found, application, as, photoconductors, in, flat, panel, x, ray, detectors, these, detectors, use, amorphous, selenium, to, capture, and, convert, incident, x, ray, photons, directly, into, electric, charge, selenium, has, been, chosen, for, this, application, among, other, semiconductors, owing, to, a, combination, of, its, favorable, technological, and, physical, properties, selenium, rectifiers, were, first, used, in, 1933, they, have, mostly, been, replaced, by, silicon, based, devices, one, notable, exception, is, in, power, dc, surge, protection, where, the, superior, energy, capabilities, of, selenium, suppressors, make, them, more, desirable, than, metal, oxide, varistors, the, demand, for, selenium, by, the, electronics, industry, is, declining, its, photovoltaic, and, photoconductive, properties, are, still, useful, in, photocopying, photocells, light, meters, and, solar, cells, its, use, as, a, photoconductor, in, plain, paper, copiers, once, was, a, leading, application, but, in, the, 1980s, the, photoconductor, application, declined, although, it, was, still, a, large, end, use, as, more, and, more, copiers, switched, to, organic, photoconductors, zinc, selenide, was, the, first, material, for, blue, leds, but, gallium, nitride, dominates, that, market, cadmium, selenide, was, an, important, component, in, quantum, dots, sheets, of, amorphous, selenium, convert, x, ray, images, to, patterns, of, charge,

be, concentrated, over, 200, 000, times, by, zooplankton, when, water, concentrations, are, in, the, 0, 5, to, 0, 8, g, se, l, range, inorganic, selenium, bioaccumulates, more, readily, in, phytoplankton, than, zooplankton, phytoplankton, can, concentrate, inorganic, selenium, by, a, factor, of, 3000, further, concentration, through, bioaccumulation, occurs, along, the, food, chain, as, predators, consume, selenium, rich, prey, it, is, recommended, that, a, water, concentration, of, 2, g, se, l, be, considered, highly, hazardous, to, sensitive, fish, and, aquatic, birds, selenium, poisoning, can, be, passed, from, parents, to, offspring, through, the, egg, and, selenium, poisoning, may, persist, for, many, generations, reproduction, of, mallard, ducks, is, impaired, at, dietary, concentrations, of, 7, g, se, l, many, benthic, invertebrates, can, tolerate, selenium, concentrations, up, to, 300, g, l, of, selenium, in, their, diet, bioaccumulation, of, selenium, in, aquatic, environments, causes, fish, kills, depending, on, the, species, in, the, affected, area, there, are, however, a, few, species, that, have, been, seen, to, survive, these, events, and, tolerate, the, increased, selenium, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, the, season, could, have, an, impact, on, the, harmful, effects, of, selenium, on, fish, substantial, physiological, changes, may, occur, in, fish, with, high, tissue, concentrations, of, selenium, fish, affected, by, selenium, may, experience, swelling, of, the, gill, lamellae, which, impedes, oxygen, diffusion, across, the, gills, and, blood, flow, within, the, gills, respiratory, capacity, is, further, reduced, due, to, selenium, binding, to, hemoglobin, other, problems, include, degeneration, of, liver, tissue, swelling, around, the, heart, damaged, egg, follicles, in, ovaries, cataracts, and, accumulation, of, fluid, in, the, body, cavity, and, head, selenium, often, causes, a, malformed, fish, fetus, which, may, have, problems, feeding, or, respiring, distortion, of, the, fins, or, spine, is, also, common, adult, fish, may, appear, healthy, despite, their, inability, to, produce, viable,

energy, coal, fired, power, plant, at, the, kesterson, national, wildlife, refuge, in, california, thousands, of, fish, and, waterbirds, were, poisoned, by, selenium, in, agricultural, irrigation, drainage, although, it, is, toxic, in, large, doses, selenium, is, an, essential, micronutrient, for, animals, in, plants, it, occurs, as, a, bystander, mineral, sometimes, in, toxic, proportions, in, forage, some, plants, may, accumulate, selenium, as, a, defense, against, being, eaten, by, animals, but, other, plants, such, as, locoweed, require, selenium, and, their, growth, indicates, the, presence, of, selenium, in, soil, the, selenium, content, in, the, human, body, is, believed, to, be, in, the, range, of, 13, 20, mg, selenium, is, a, component, of, the, unusual, amino, acids, selenocysteine, and, selenomethionine, in, humans, selenium, is, a, trace, element, nutrient, that, functions, as, cofactor, for, reduction, of, antioxidant, enzymes, such, as, glutathione, peroxidases, and, certain, forms, of, thioredoxin, reductase, found, in, animals, and, some, plants, this, enzyme, occurs, in, all, living, organisms, but, not, all, forms, of, it, in, plants, require, selenium, the, glutathione, peroxidase, family, of, enzymes, gsh, px, catalyze, reactions, that, remove, reactive, oxygen, species, such, as, hydrogen, peroxide, and, organic, hydroperoxides, the, thyroid, gland, and, every, cell, that, uses, thyroid, hormone, also, use, selenium, which, is, a, cofactor, for, the, three, of, the, four, known, types, of, thyroid, hormone, deiodinases, which, activate, and, then, deactivate, various, thyroid, hormones, and, their, metabolites, the, iodothyronine, deiodinases, are, the, subfamily, of, deiodinase, enzymes, that, use, selenium, as, the, otherwise, rare, amino, acid, selenocysteine, only, the, deiodinase, iodotyrosine, deiodinase, which, works, on, the, last, breakdown, products, of, thyroid, hormone, does, not, use, selenium, selenium, may, also, inhibit, hashimoto, s, disease, in, the, thyroid, in, which, the, body, s, own, thyroid, cells, are, attacked, as, foreign, a, reduction, of, 21, on, tpo, antibodies, is, reported, with, the, dietary, intake, of, 0, 2, mg, of, selenium, increased, dietary, selenium, reduces, the, effects, of, mercury, toxicity, although, it, is, effective, only, at, low, to, modest, doses, of, mercury, evidence, suggests, that, the, molecular, mechanisms, of, mercury, toxicity, include, the, irreversible, inhibition, of, selenoenzymes, that, are, required, to, prevent, and, reverse, oxidative, damage, in, brain, and, endocrine, tissues, the, selenium, containing, compound, selenoneine, is, present, in, the, blood, of, bluefin, tuna, certain, species, of, plants, are, considered, indicators, of, high, selenium, content, of, the, soil, because, they, require, high, levels, of, selenium, to, thrive, the, main, selenium, indicator, plants, are, astragalus, species, including, some, locoweeds, prince, s, plume, stanleya, sp, woody, asters, xylorhiza, sp, and, false, goldenweed, oonopsis, sp, from, about, three, billion, years, ago, prokaryotic, selenoprotein, families, drive, the, evolution, of, selenocysteine, an, amino, acid, selenium, is, incorporated, into, several, prokaryotic, selenoprotein, families, in, bacteria, archaea, and, eukaryotes, as, selenocysteine, where, selenoprotein, peroxiredoxins, protect, bacterial, and, eukaryotic, cells, against, oxidative, damage, selenoprotein, families, of, gsh, px, and, the, deiodinases, of, eukaryotic, cells, seem, to, have, a, bacterial, phylogenetic, origin, the, selenocysteine, containing, form, occurs, in, species, as, diverse, as, green, algae, diatoms, sea, urchins, fish, and, chickens, selenium, enzymes, are, involved, in, the, small, reducing, molecules, glutathione, and, thioredoxin, one, family, of, selenium, bearing, molecules, the, glutathione, peroxidases, destroys, peroxide, and, repairs, damaged, peroxidized, cell, membranes, using, glutathione, another, selenium, bearing, enzyme, in, some, plants, and, in, animals, thioredoxin, reductase, generates, reduced, thioredoxin, a, dithiol, that, serves, as, an, electron, source, for, peroxidases, and, also, the, important, reducing, enzyme, ribonucleotide, reductase, that, makes, dna, precursors, from, rna,

terrestrial, mineral, deficient, areas, marine, organisms, retained, and, sometimes, expanded, their, selenoproteomes, whereas, the, selenoproteomes, of, some, terrestrial, organisms, were, reduced, or, completely, lost, these, findings, suggest, that, with, the, exception, of, vertebrates, aquatic, life, supports, selenium, use, whereas, terrestrial, habitats, lead, to, reduced, use, of, this, trace, element, marine, fishes, and, vertebrate, thyroid, glands, have, the, highest, concentration, of, selenium, and, iodine, from, about, 500, million, years, ago, freshwater, and, terrestrial, plants, slowly, optimized, the, production, of, new, endogenous, antioxidants, such, as, ascorbic, acid, vitamin, c, polyphenols, including, flavonoids, tocopherols, etc, a, few, of, these, appeared, in, the, last, 50, 200, million, years, in, fruits, and, flowers, of, angiosperm, plants, in, fact, the, angiosperms, the, dominant, type, of, plant, today, and, most, of, their, antioxidant, pigments, evolved, during, the, late, jurassic, period, the, deiodinase, isoenzymes, constitutes, another, family, of, eukaryotic, selenoenzymes, deiodinases, are, involved, in, thyroid, hormone, regulation, participating, in, the, protection, of, thyrocytes, from, damage, by, h, 2, o, 2, produced, for, thyroid, hormone, biosynthesis, about, 200, million, years, ago, new, selenoproteins, were, developed, as, mammalian, gsh, px, enzymes, although, selenium, is, an, essential, trace, element, it, is, toxic, if, taken, in, excess, exceeding, the, tolerable, upper, intake, level, of, 400, micrograms, per, day, can, lead, to, selenosis, this, 400, g, tolerable, upper, intake, level, is, based, primarily, on, a, 1986, study, of, five, chinese, patients, who, exhibited, overt, signs, of, selenosis, and, a, follow, up, study, on, the, same, five, people, in, 1992, the, 1992, study, found, the, maximum, safe, dietary, selenium, intake, to, be, approximately, 800, micrograms, per, day, 15, micrograms, per, kilogram, body, weight, but, suggested, 400, micrograms, per, day, to, avoid, creating, an, imbalance, of, nutrients, in, the, diet, and, to, accord, with, data, from, other, countries, in, china, people, who, ingested, corn, grown, in, extremely, selenium, rich, stony, coal, carbonaceous, shale, have, suffered, from, selenium, toxicity, this, coal, was, shown, to, have, selenium, content, as, high, as, 9, 1, the, highest, concentration, in, coal, ever, recorded, signs, and, symptoms, of, selenosis, include, a, garlic, odor, on, the, breath, gastrointestinal, disorders, hair, loss, sloughing, of, nails, fatigue, irritability, and, neurological, damage, extreme, cases, of, selenosis, can, exhibit, cirrhosis, of, the, liver, pulmonary, edema, or, death, elemental, selenium, and, most, metallic, selenides, have, relatively, low, toxicities, because, of, low, bioavailability, by, contrast, selenates, and, selenites, have, an, oxidant, mode, of, action, similar, to, that, of, arsenic, trioxide, and, are, very, toxic, the, chronic, toxic, dose, of, selenite, for, humans, is, about, 2400, to, 3000, micrograms, of, selenium, per, day, hydrogen, selenide, is, an, extremely, toxic, corrosive, gas, selenium, also, occurs, in, organic, compounds, such, as, dimethyl, selenide, selenomethionine, selenocysteine, and, methylselenocysteine, all, of, which, have, high, bioavailability, and, are, toxic, in, large, doses, on, 19, april, 2009, 21, polo, ponies, died, shortly, before, a, match, in, the, united, states, polo, open, three, days, later,
