the, atomic, mass, m, a, or, m, is, the, mass, of, an, atom, although, the, si, unit, of, mass, is, the, kilogram, symbol, kg, atomic, mass, is, often, expressed, in, the, non, si, unit, dalton, symbol, da, equivalently, unified, atomic, mass, unit, u, 1, da, is, defined, as, 1, 12, of, the, mass, of, a, free, carbon, 12, atom, at, rest, in, its, ground, state, the, protons, and, neutrons, of, the, nucleus, account, for, nearly, all, of, the, total, mass, of, atoms, with, the, electrons, and, nuclear, binding, energy, making, minor, contributions, thus, the, numeric, value, of, the, atomic, mass, when, expressed, in, daltons, has, nearly, the, same, value, as, the, mass, number, conversion, between, mass, in, kilograms, and, mass, in, daltons, can, be, done, using, the, atomic, mass, constant, m, u, m, 12, c, 12, 1, d, a, displaystyle, m, rm, u, m, rm, 12, c, over, 12, 1, rm, da, the, formula, used, for, conversion, is, where, m, u, displaystyle, m, rm, u, is, the, molar, mass, constant, n, a, displaystyle, n, rm, a, is, the, avogadro, constant, and, m, 12, c, displaystyle, m, 12, mathrm, c, is, the, experimentally, determined, molar, mass, of, carbon, 12, the, relative, isotopic, mass, see, section, below, can, be, obtained, by, dividing, the, atomic, mass, m, a, of, an, isotope, by, the, atomic, mass, constant, m, u, yielding, a, dimensionless, value, thus, the, atomic, mass, of, a, carbon, 12, atom, is, 12, da, by, definition, but, the, relative, isotopic, mass, of, a, carbon, 12, atom, is, simply, 12, the, sum, of, relative, isotopic, masses, of, all, atoms, in, a, molecule, is, the, relative, molecular, mass, the, atomic, mass, of, an, isotope, and, the, relative, isotopic, mass, refers, to, a, certain, specific, isotope, of, an, element, because, substances, are, usually, not, isotopically, pure, it, is, convenient, to, use, the, elemental, atomic, mass, which, is, the, average, mean, atomic, mass, of, an, element, weighted, by, the, abundance, of, the, isotopes, the, dimensionless, standard, atomic, weight, is, the, weighted, mean, relative, isotopic, mass, of, a, typical, naturally, occurring, mixture, of, isotopes, the, atomic, mass, of, atoms, ions, or, atomic, nuclei, is, slightly, less, than, the, sum, of, the, masses, of, their, constituent, protons, neutrons, and, electrons, due, to, binding, energy, mass, loss, per, e, mc, 2, relative, isotopic, mass, a, property, of, a, single, atom, is, not, to, be, confused, with, the, averaged, quantity, atomic, weight, see, above, that, is, an, average, of, values, for, many, atoms, in, a, given, sample, of, a, chemical, element, while, atomic, mass, is, an, absolute, mass, relative, isotopic, mass, is, a, dimensionless, number, with, no, units, this, loss, of, units, results, from, the, use, of, a, scaling, ratio, with, respect, to, a, carbon, 12, standard, and, the, word, relative, in, the, term, relative, isotopic, mass, refers, to, this, scaling, relative, to, carbon, 12, the, relative, isotopic, mass, then, is, the, mass, of, a, given, isotope, specifically, any, single, nuclide, when, this, value, is, scaled, by, the, mass, of, carbon, 12, where, the, latter, has, to, be, determined, experimentally, equivalently, the, relative, isotopic, mass, of, an, isotope, or, nuclide, is, the, mass, of, the, isotope, relative, to, 1, 12, of, the, mass, of, a, carbon, 12, atom, for, example, the, relative, isotopic, mass, of, a, carbon, 12, atom, is, exactly, 12, for, comparison, the, atomic, mass, of, a, carbon, 12, atom, is, exactly, 12, daltons, alternately, the, atomic, mass, of, a, carbon, 12, atom, may, be, expressed, in, any, other, mass, units, for, example, the, atomic, mass, of, a, carbon, 12, atom, is, 1, 992, 646, 882, 70, 62, 10, 26, kg, as, is, the, case, for, the, related, atomic, mass, when, expressed, in, daltons, the, relative, isotopic, mass, numbers, of, nuclides, other, than, carbon, 12, are, not, whole, numbers, but, are, always, close, to, whole, numbers, this, is, discussed, fully, below, the, atomic, mass, or, relative, isotopic, mass, are, sometimes, confused, or, incorrectly, used, as, synonyms, of, relative, atomic, mass, also, known, as, atomic, weight, or, the, standard, atomic, weight, a, particular, variety, of, atomic, weight, in, the, sense, that, it, is, standardized, however, as, noted, in, the, introduction, atomic, mass, is, an, absolute, mass, while, all, other, terms, are, dimensionless, relative, atomic, mass, and, standard, atomic, weight, represent, terms, for, abundance, weighted, averages, of, relative, atomic, masses, in, elemental, samples, not, for, single, nuclides, as, such, relative, atomic, mass, and, standard, atomic, weight, often, differ, numerically, from, the, relative, isotopic, mass, the, atomic, mass, relative, isotopic, mass, is, defined, as, the, mass, of, a, single, atom, which, can, only, be, one, isotope, nuclide, at, a, time, and, is, not, an, abundance, weighted, average, as, in, the, case, of, relative, atomic, mass, atomic, weight, the, atomic, mass, or, relative, isotopic, mass, of, each, isotope, and, nuclide, of, a, chemical, element, is, therefore, a, number, that, can, in, principle, be, measured, to, high, precision, since, every, specimen, of, such, a, nuclide, is, expected, to, be, exactly, identical, to, every, other, specimen, as, all, atoms, of, a, given, type, in, the, same, energy, state, and, every, specimen, of, a, particular, nuclide, are, expected, to, be, exactly, identical, in, mass, to, every, other, specimen, of, that, nuclide, for, example, every, atom, of, oxygen, 16, is, expected, to, have, exactly, the, same, atomic, mass, relative, isotopic, mass, as, every, other, atom, of, oxygen, 16, in, the, case, of, many, elements, that, have, one, naturally, occurring, isotope, mononuclidic, elements, or, one, dominant, isotope, the, difference, between, the, atomic, mass, of, the, most, common, isotope, and, the, standard, relative, atomic, mass, or, standard, atomic, weight, can, be, small, or, even, nil, and, does, not, affect, most, bulk, calculations, however, such, an, error, can, exist, and, even, be, important, when, considering, individual, atoms, for, elements, that, are, not, mononuclidic, for, non, mononuclidic, elements, that, have, more, than, one, common, isotope, the, numerical, difference, in, relative, atomic, mass, atomic, weight, from, even, the, most, common, relative, isotopic, mass, can, be, half, a, mass, unit, or, more, e, g, see, the, case, of, chlorine, where, atomic, weight, and, standard, atomic, weight, are, about, 35, 45, the, atomic, mass, relative, isotopic, mass, of, an, uncommon, isotope, can, differ, from, the, relative, atomic, mass, atomic, weight, or, standard, atomic, weight, by, several, mass, units, relative, isotopic, masses, are, always, close, to, whole, number, values, but, never, except, in, the, case, of, carbon, 12, exactly, a, whole, number, for, two, reasons, the, ratio, of, atomic, mass, to, mass, number, number, of, nucleons, varies, from, 0, 998, 838, 1346, 51, for, 56, fe, to, 1, 007, 825, 031, 898, 14, for, 1, h, any, mass, defect, due, to, nuclear, binding, energy, is, experimentally, a, small, fraction, less, than, 1, of, the, mass, of, an, equal, number, of, free, nucleons, when, compared, to, the, average, mass, per, nucleon, in, carbon, 12, which, is, moderately, strongly, bound, compared, with, other, atoms, the, mass, defect, of, binding, for, most, atoms, is, an, even, smaller, fraction, of, a, dalton, unified, atomic, mass, unit, based, on, carbon, 12, since, free, protons, and, neutrons, differ, from, each, other, in, mass, by, a, small, fraction, of, a, dalton, 1, 388, 449, 33, 49, 10, 3, da, rounding, the, relative, isotopic, mass, or, the, atomic, mass, of, any, given, nuclide, given, in, daltons, to, the, nearest, whole, number, always, gives, the, nucleon, count, or, mass, number, additionally, the, neutron, count, neutron, number, may, then, be, derived, by, subtracting, the, number, of, protons, atomic, number, from, the, mass, number, nucleon, count, the, amount, that, the, ratio, of, atomic, masses, to, mass, number, deviates, from, 1, is, as, follows, the, deviation, starts, positive, at, hydrogen, 1, then, decreases, until, it, reaches, a, local, minimum, at, helium, 4, isotopes, of, lithium, beryllium, and, boron, are, less, strongly, bound, than, helium, as, shown, by, their, increasing, mass, to, mass, number, ratios, at, carbon, the, ratio, of, mass, in, daltons, to, mass, number, is, defined, as, 1, and, after, carbon, it, becomes, less, than, one, until, a, minimum, is, reached, at, iron, 56, with, only, slightly, higher, values, for, iron, 58, and, nickel, 62, then, increases, to, positive, values, in, the, heavy, isotopes, with, increasing, atomic, number, this, corresponds, to, the, fact, that, nuclear, fission, in, an, element, heavier, than, zirconium, produces, energy, and, fission, in, any, element, lighter, than, niobium, requires, energy, on, the, other, hand, nuclear, fusion, of, two, atoms, of, an, element, lighter, than, scandium, except, for, helium, produces, energy, whereas, fusion, in, elements, heavier, than, calcium, requires, energy, the, fusion, of, two, atoms, of, 4, he, yielding, beryllium, 8, would, require, energy, and, the, beryllium, would, quickly, fall, apart, again, 4, he, can, fuse, with, tritium, 3, h, or, with, 3, he, these, processes, occurred, during, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, the, formation, of, elements, with, more, than, seven, nucleons, requires, the, fusion, of, three, atoms, of, 4, he, in, the, triple, alpha, process, skipping, over, lithium, beryllium, and, boron, to, produce, carbon, 12, here, are, some, values, of, the, ratio, of, atomic, mass, to, mass, number, direct, comparison, and, measurement, of, the, masses, of, atoms, is, achieved, with, mass, spectrometry, similar, definitions, apply, to, molecules, one, can, calculate, the, molecular, mass, of, a, compound, by, adding, the, atomic, masses, not, the, standard, atomic, weights, of, its, constituent, atoms, conversely, the, molar, mass, is, usually, computed, from, the, standard, atomic, weights, not, the, atomic, or, nuclide, masses, thus, molecular, mass, and, molar, mass, differ, slightly, in, numerical, value, and, represent, different, concepts, molecular, mass, is, the, mass, of, a, molecule, which, is, the, sum, of, its, constituent, atomic, masses, molar, mass, is, an, average, of, the, masses, of, the, constituent, molecules, in, a, chemically, pure, but, isotopically, heterogeneous, ensemble, in, both, cases, the, multiplicity, of, the, atoms, the, number, of, times, it, occurs, must, be, taken, into, account, usually, by, multiplication, of, each, unique, mass, by, its, multiplicity, the, first, scientists, to, determine, relative, atomic, masses, were, john, dalton, and, thomas, thomson, between, 1803, and, 1805, and, j, ns, jakob, berzelius, between, 1808, and, 1826, relative, atomic, mass, atomic, weight, was, originally, defined, relative, to, that, of, the, lightest, element, hydrogen, which, was, taken, as, 1, 00, and, in, the, 1820s, prout, s, hypothesis, stated, that, atomic, masses, of, all, elements, would, prove, to, be, exact, multiples, of, that, of, hydrogen, berzelius, however, soon, proved, that, this, was, not, even, approximately, true, and, for, some, elements, such, as, chlorine, relative, atomic, mass, at, about, 35, 5, falls, almost, exactly, halfway, between, two, integral, multiples, of, that, of, hydrogen, still, later, this, was, shown, to, be, largely, due, to, a, mix, of, isotopes, and, that, the, atomic, masses, of, pure, isotopes, or, nuclides, are, multiples, of, the, hydrogen, mass, to, within, about, 1, in, the, 1860s, stanislao, cannizzaro, refined, relative, atomic, masses, by, applying, avogadro, s, law, notably, at, the, karlsruhe, congress, of, 1860, he, formulated, a, law, to, determine, relative, atomic, masses, of, elements, the, different, quantities, of, the, same, element, contained, in, different, molecules, are, all, whole, multiples, of, the, atomic, weight, and, determined, relative, atomic, masses, and, molecular, masses, by, comparing, the, vapor, density, of, a, collection, of, gases, with, molecules, containing, one, or, more, of, the, chemical, element, in, question, in, the, 20th, century, until, the, 1960s, chemists, and, physicists, used, two, different, atomic, mass, scales, the, chemists, used, an, atomic, mass, unit, amu, scale, such, that, the, natural, mixture, of, oxygen, isotopes, had, an, atomic, mass, 16, while, the, physicists, assigned, the, same, number, 16, to, only, the, atomic, mass, of, the, most, common, oxygen, isotope, 16, o, containing, eight, protons, and, eight, neutrons, however, because, oxygen, 17, and, oxygen, 18, are, also, present, in, natural, oxygen, this, led, to, two, different, tables, of, atomic, mass, the, unified, scale, based, on, carbon, 12, 12, c, met, the, physicists, need, to, base, the, scale, on, a, pure, isotope, while, being, numerically, close, to, the, chemists, scale, this, was, adopted, as, the, unified, atomic, mass, unit, the, current, international, system, of, units, si, primary, recommendation, for, the, name, of, this, unit, is, the, dalton, and, symbol, da, the, name, unified, atomic, mass, unit, and, symbol, u, are, recognized, names, and, symbols, for, the, same, unit, the, term, atomic, weight, is, being, phased, out, slowly, and, being, replaced, by, relative, atomic, mass, in, most, current, usage, this, shift, in, nomenclature, reaches, back, to, the, 1960s, and, has, been, the, source, of, much, debate, in, the, scientific, community, which, was, triggered, by, the, adoption, of, the, unified, atomic, mass, unit, and, the, realization, that, weight, was, in, some, ways, an, inappropriate, term, the, argument, for, keeping, the, term, atomic, weight, was, primarily, that, it, was, a, well, understood, term, to, those, in, the, field, that, the, term, atomic, mass, was, already, in, use, as, it, is, currently, defined, and, that, the, term, relative, atomic, mass, might, be, easily, confused, with, relative, isotopic, mass, the, mass, of, a, single, atom, of, a, given, nuclide, expressed, dimensionlessly, relative, to, 1, 12, of, the, mass, of, carbon, 12, see, section, above, in, 1979, as, a, compromise, the, term, relative, atomic, mass, was, introduced, as, a, secondary, synonym, for, atomic, weight, twenty, years, later, the, primacy, of, these, synonyms, was, reversed, and, the, term, relative, atomic, mass, is, now, the, preferred, term, however, the, term, standard, atomic, weights, referring, to, the, standardized, expectation, atomic, weights, of, differing, samples, has, not, been, changed, because, simple, replacement, of, atomic, weight, with, relative, atomic, mass, would, have, resulted, in, the, term, standard, relative, atomic, mass
