the, asteroid, belt, is, a, torus, shaped, region, in, the, solar, system, centered, on, the, sun, and, roughly, spanning, the, space, between, the, orbits, of, the, planets, jupiter, and, mars, it, contains, a, great, many, solid, irregularly, shaped, bodies, called, asteroids, or, minor, planets, the, identified, objects, are, of, many, sizes, but, much, smaller, than, planets, and, on, average, are, about, one, million, kilometers, or, six, hundred, thousand, miles, apart, this, asteroid, belt, is, also, called, the, main, asteroid, belt, or, main, belt, to, distinguish, it, from, other, asteroid, populations, in, the, solar, system, the, asteroid, belt, is, the, smallest, and, innermost, known, circumstellar, disc, in, the, solar, system, classes, of, small, solar, system, bodies, in, other, regions, are, the, near, earth, objects, the, centaurs, the, kuiper, belt, objects, the, scattered, disc, objects, the, sednoids, and, the, oort, cloud, objects, about, 60, of, the, main, belt, mass, is, contained, in, the, four, largest, asteroids, ceres, vesta, pallas, and, hygiea, the, total, mass, of, the, asteroid, belt, is, estimated, to, be, 3, that, of, the, moon, ceres, the, only, object, in, the, asteroid, belt, large, enough, to, be, a, dwarf, planet, is, about, 950, km, in, diameter, whereas, vesta, pallas, and, hygiea, have, mean, diameters, less, than, 600, km, the, remaining, mineralogically, classified, bodies, range, in, size, down, to, a, few, metres, the, asteroid, material, is, so, thinly, distributed, that, numerous, uncrewed, spacecraft, have, traversed, it, without, incident, nonetheless, collisions, between, large, asteroids, occur, and, can, produce, an, asteroid, family, whose, members, have, similar, orbital, characteristics, and, compositions, individual, asteroids, within, the, belt, are, categorized, by, their, spectra, with, most, falling, into, three, basic, groups, carbonaceous, c, type, silicate, s, type, and, metal, rich, m, type, the, asteroid, belt, formed, from, the, primordial, solar, nebula, as, a, group, of, planetesimals, the, smaller, precursors, of, the, protoplanets, however, between, mars, and, jupiter, gravitational, perturbations, from, jupiter, disrupted, their, accretion, into, a, planet, imparting, excess, kinetic, energy, which, shattered, colliding, planetesimals, and, most, of, the, incipient, protoplanets, as, a, result, 99, 9, of, the, asteroid, belt, s, original, mass, was, lost, in, the, first, 100, million, years, of, the, solar, system, s, history, some, fragments, eventually, found, their, way, into, the, inner, solar, system, leading, to, meteorite, impacts, with, the, inner, planets, asteroid, orbits, continue, to, be, appreciably, perturbed, whenever, their, period, of, revolution, about, the, sun, forms, an, orbital, resonance, with, jupiter, at, these, orbital, distances, a, kirkwood, gap, occurs, as, they, are, swept, into, other, orbits, in, 1596, johannes, kepler, wrote, between, mars, and, jupiter, i, place, a, planet, in, his, mysterium, cosmographicum, stating, his, prediction, that, a, planet, would, be, found, there, while, analyzing, tycho, brahe, s, data, kepler, thought, that, too, large, a, gap, existed, between, the, orbits, of, mars, and, jupiter, to, fit, his, own, model, of, where, planetary, orbits, should, be, found, in, an, anonymous, footnote, to, his, 1766, translation, of, charles, bonnet, s, contemplation, de, la, nature, the, astronomer, johann, daniel, titius, of, wittenberg, noted, an, apparent, pattern, in, the, layout, of, the, planets, now, known, as, the, titius, bode, law, if, one, began, a, numerical, sequence, at, 0, then, included, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, etc, doubling, each, time, and, added, four, to, each, number, and, divided, by, 10, this, produced, a, remarkably, close, approximation, to, the, radii, of, the, orbits, of, the, known, planets, as, measured, in, astronomical, units, provided, one, allowed, for, a, missing, planet, equivalent, to, 24, in, the, sequence, between, the, orbits, of, mars, 12, and, jupiter, 48, in, his, footnote, titius, declared, but, should, the, lord, architect, have, left, that, space, empty, not, at, all, when, william, herschel, discovered, uranus, in, 1781, the, planet, s, orbit, closely, matched, the, law, leading, some, astronomers, to, conclude, that, a, planet, had, to, be, between, the, orbits, of, mars, and, jupiter, on, january, 1, 1801, giuseppe, piazzi, chairman, of, astronomy, at, the, university, of, palermo, sicily, found, a, tiny, moving, object, in, an, orbit, with, exactly, the, radius, predicted, by, this, pattern, he, dubbed, it, ceres, after, the, roman, goddess, of, the, harvest, and, patron, of, sicily, piazzi, initially, believed, it, to, be, a, comet, but, its, lack, of, a, coma, suggested, it, was, a, planet, thus, the, aforementioned, pattern, predicted, the, semimajor, axes, of, all, eight, planets, of, the, time, mercury, venus, earth, mars, ceres, jupiter, saturn, and, uranus, concurrent, with, the, discovery, of, ceres, an, informal, group, of, 24, astronomers, dubbed, the, celestial, police, was, formed, under, the, invitation, of, franz, xaver, von, zach, with, the, express, purpose, of, finding, additional, planets, they, focused, their, search, for, them, in, the, region, between, mars, and, jupiter, where, the, titius, bode, law, predicted, there, should, be, a, planet, about, 15, months, later, heinrich, olbers, a, member, of, the, celestial, police, discovered, a, second, object, in, the, same, region, pallas, unlike, the, other, known, planets, ceres, and, pallas, remained, points, of, light, even, under, the, highest, telescope, magnifications, instead, of, resolving, into, discs, apart, from, their, rapid, movement, they, appeared, indistinguishable, from, stars, accordingly, in, 1802, william, herschel, suggested, they, be, placed, into, a, separate, category, named, asteroids, after, the, greek, asteroeides, meaning, star, like, upon, completing, a, series, of, observations, of, ceres, and, pallas, he, concluded, neither, the, appellation, of, planets, nor, that, of, comets, can, with, any, propriety, of, language, be, given, to, these, two, stars, they, resemble, small, stars, so, much, as, hardly, to, be, distinguished, from, them, from, this, their, asteroidal, appearance, if, i, take, my, name, and, call, them, asteroids, reserving, for, myself, however, the, liberty, of, changing, that, name, if, another, more, expressive, of, their, nature, should, occur, by, 1807, further, investigation, revealed, two, new, objects, in, the, region, juno, and, vesta, the, burning, of, lilienthal, in, the, napoleonic, wars, where, the, main, body, of, work, had, been, done, brought, this, first, period, of, discovery, to, a, close, despite, herschel, s, coinage, for, several, decades, it, remained, common, practice, to, refer, to, these, objects, as, planets, and, to, prefix, their, names, with, numbers, representing, their, sequence, of, discovery, 1, ceres, 2, pallas, 3, juno, 4, vesta, in, 1845, though, the, astronomer, karl, ludwig, hencke, detected, a, fifth, object, 5, astraea, and, shortly, thereafter, new, objects, were, found, at, an, accelerating, rate, counting, them, among, the, planets, became, increasingly, cumbersome, eventually, they, were, dropped, from, the, planet, list, as, first, suggested, by, alexander, von, humboldt, in, the, early, 1850s, and, herschel, s, coinage, asteroids, gradually, came, into, common, use, the, discovery, of, neptune, in, 1846, led, to, the, discrediting, of, the, titius, bode, law, in, the, eyes, of, scientists, because, its, orbit, was, nowhere, near, the, predicted, position, to, date, no, scientific, explanation, for, the, law, has, been, given, and, astronomers, consensus, regards, it, as, a, coincidence, the, expression, asteroid, belt, came, into, use, in, the, early, 1850s, although, pinpointing, who, coined, the, term, is, difficult, the, first, english, use, seems, to, be, in, the, 1850, translation, by, elise, ott, of, alexander, von, humboldt, s, cosmos, and, the, regular, appearance, about, the, 13th, of, november, and, the, 11th, of, august, of, shooting, stars, which, probably, form, part, of, a, belt, of, asteroids, intersecting, the, earth, s, orbit, and, moving, with, planetary, velocity, another, early, appearance, occurred, in, robert, james, mann, s, a, guide, to, the, knowledge, of, the, heavens, the, orbits, of, the, asteroids, are, placed, in, a, wide, belt, of, space, extending, between, the, extremes, of, the, american, astronomer, benjamin, peirce, seems, to, have, adopted, that, terminology, and, to, have, been, one, of, its, promoters, over, 100, asteroids, had, been, located, by, mid, 1868, and, in, 1891, the, introduction, of, astrophotography, by, max, wolf, accelerated, the, rate, of, discovery, a, total, of, 1, 000, asteroids, had, been, found, by, 1921, 10, 000, by, 1981, and, 100, 000, by, 2000, modern, asteroid, survey, systems, now, use, automated, means, to, locate, new, minor, planets, in, ever, increasing, numbers, on, 22, january, 2014, european, space, agency, esa, scientists, reported, the, detection, for, the, first, definitive, time, of, water, vapor, on, ceres, the, largest, object, in, the, asteroid, belt, the, detection, was, made, by, using, the, far, infrared, abilities, of, the, herschel, space, observatory, the, finding, was, unexpected, because, comets, not, asteroids, are, typically, considered, to, sprout, jets, and, plumes, according, to, one, of, the, scientists, the, lines, are, becoming, more, and, more, blurred, between, comets, and, asteroids, in, 1802, shortly, after, discovering, pallas, olbers, suggested, to, herschel, and, carl, gauss, that, ceres, and, pallas, were, fragments, of, a, much, larger, planet, that, once, occupied, the, mars, jupiter, region, with, this, planet, having, suffered, an, internal, explosion, or, a, cometary, impact, many, million, years, before, while, odesan, astronomer, k, n, savchenko, suggested, that, ceres, pallas, juno, and, vesta, were, escaped, moons, rather, than, fragments, of, the, exploded, planet, the, large, amount, of, energy, required, to, destroy, a, planet, combined, with, the, belt, s, low, combined, mass, which, is, only, about, 4, of, the, mass, of, earth, s, moon, does, not, support, these, hypotheses, further, the, significant, chemical, differences, between, the, asteroids, become, difficult, to, explain, if, they, come, from, the, same, planet, a, modern, hypothesis, for, the, asteroid, belt, s, creation, relates, to, how, in, general, for, the, solar, system, planetary, formation, is, thought, to, have, occurred, via, a, process, comparable, to, the, long, standing, nebular, hypothesis, a, cloud, of, interstellar, dust, and, gas, collapsed, under, the, influence, of, gravity, to, form, a, rotating, disc, of, material, that, then, conglomerated, to, form, the, sun, and, planets, during, the, first, few, million, years, of, the, solar, system, s, history, an, accretion, process, of, sticky, collisions, caused, the, clumping, of, small, particles, which, gradually, increased, in, size, once, the, clumps, reached, sufficient, mass, they, could, draw, in, other, bodies, through, gravitational, attraction, and, become, planetesimals, this, gravitational, accretion, led, to, the, formation, of, the, planets, planetesimals, within, the, region, that, would, become, the, asteroid, belt, were, strongly, perturbed, by, jupiter, s, gravity, orbital, resonances, occurred, where, the, orbital, period, of, an, object, in, the, belt, formed, an, integer, fraction, of, the, orbital, period, of, jupiter, perturbing, the, object, into, a, different, orbit, the, region, lying, between, the, orbits, of, mars, and, jupiter, contains, many, such, orbital, resonances, as, jupiter, migrated, inward, following, its, formation, these, resonances, would, have, swept, across, the, asteroid, belt, dynamically, exciting, the, region, s, population, and, increasing, their, velocities, relative, to, each, other, in, regions, where, the, average, velocity, of, the, collisions, was, too, high, the, shattering, of, planetesimals, tended, to, dominate, over, accretion, preventing, the, formation, of, a, planet, instead, they, continued, to, orbit, the, sun, as, before, occasionally, colliding, during, the, early, history, of, the, solar, system, the, asteroids, melted, to, some, degree, allowing, elements, within, them, to, be, differentiated, by, mass, some, of, the, progenitor, bodies, may, even, have, undergone, periods, of, explosive, volcanism, and, formed, magma, oceans, because, of, the, relatively, small, size, of, the, bodies, though, the, period, of, melting, was, necessarily, brief, compared, to, the, much, larger, planets, and, had, generally, ended, about, 4, 5, billion, years, ago, in, the, first, tens, of, millions, of, years, of, formation, in, august, 2007, a, study, of, zircon, crystals, in, an, antarctic, meteorite, believed, to, have, originated, from, vesta, suggested, that, it, and, by, extension, the, rest, of, the, asteroid, belt, had, formed, rather, quickly, within, 10, million, years, of, the, solar, system, s, origin, the, asteroids, are, not, pristine, samples, of, the, primordial, solar, system, they, have, undergone, considerable, evolution, since, their, formation, including, internal, heating, in, the, first, few, tens, of, millions, of, years, surface, melting, from, impacts, space, weathering, from, radiation, and, bombardment, by, micrometeorites, although, some, scientists, refer, to, the, asteroids, as, residual, planetesimals, other, scientists, consider, them, distinct, the, current, asteroid, belt, is, believed, to, contain, only, a, small, fraction, of, the, mass, of, the, primordial, belt, computer, simulations, suggest, that, the, original, asteroid, belt, may, have, contained, mass, equivalent, to, the, earth, s, primarily, because, of, gravitational, perturbations, most, of, the, material, was, ejected, from, the, belt, within, about, 1, million, years, of, formation, leaving, behind, less, than, 0, 1, of, the, original, mass, since, its, formation, the, size, distribution, of, the, asteroid, belt, has, remained, relatively, stable, no, significant, increase, or, decrease, in, the, typical, dimensions, of, the, main, belt, asteroids, has, occurred, the, 4, 1, orbital, resonance, with, jupiter, at, a, radius, 2, 06, astronomical, units, aus, can, be, considered, the, inner, boundary, of, the, asteroid, belt, perturbations, by, jupiter, send, bodies, straying, there, into, unstable, orbits, most, bodies, formed, within, the, radius, of, this, gap, were, swept, up, by, mars, which, has, an, aphelion, at, 1, 67, au, or, ejected, by, its, gravitational, perturbations, in, the, early, history, of, the, solar, system, the, hungaria, asteroids, lie, closer, to, the, sun, than, the, 4, 1, resonance, but, are, protected, from, disruption, by, their, high, inclination, when, the, asteroid, belt, was, first, formed, the, temperatures, at, a, distance, of, 2, 7, au, from, the, sun, formed, a, snow, line, below, the, freezing, point, of, water, planetesimals, formed, beyond, this, radius, were, able, to, accumulate, ice, in, 2006, a, population, of, comets, had, been, discovered, within, the, asteroid, belt, beyond, the, snow, line, which, may, have, provided, a, source, of, water, for, earth, s, oceans, according, to, some, models, outgassing, of, water, during, the, earth, s, formative, period, was, insufficient, to, form, the, oceans, requiring, an, external, source, such, as, a, cometary, bombardment, the, outer, asteroid, belt, appears, to, include, a, few, objects, that, may, have, arrived, there, during, the, last, few, hundred, years, the, list, includes, 457175, 2008, go, 98, also, known, as, 362p, contrary, to, popular, imagery, the, asteroid, belt, is, mostly, empty, the, asteroids, are, spread, over, such, a, large, volume, that, reaching, an, asteroid, without, aiming, carefully, would, be, improbable, nonetheless, hundreds, of, thousands, of, asteroids, are, currently, known, and, the, total, number, ranges, in, the, millions, or, more, depending, on, the, lower, size, cutoff, over, 200, asteroids, are, known, to, be, larger, than, 100, km, and, a, survey, in, the, infrared, wavelengths, has, shown, that, the, asteroid, belt, has, between, 700, 000, and, 1, 7, million, asteroids, with, a, diameter, of, 1, km, or, more, the, number, of, asteroids, in, the, main, belt, steadily, increases, with, decreasing, size, although, the, size, distribution, generally, follows, a, power, law, there, are, bumps, in, the, curve, at, about, 5, km, and, 100, km, where, more, asteroids, than, expected, from, such, a, curve, are, found, most, asteroids, larger, than, approximately, 120, km, in, diameter, are, primordial, having, survived, from, the, accretion, epoch, whereas, most, smaller, asteroids, are, products, of, fragmentation, of, primordial, asteroids, the, primordial, population, of, the, main, belt, was, probably, 200, times, what, it, is, today, the, absolute, magnitudes, of, most, of, the, known, asteroids, are, between, 11, and, 19, with, the, median, at, about, 16, on, average, the, distance, between, the, asteroids, is, about, 965, 600, km, 600, 000, mi, although, this, varies, among, asteroid, families, and, smaller, undetected, asteroids, might, be, even, closer, the, total, mass, of, the, asteroid, belt, is, estimated, to, be, 2, 39, 10, 21, kg, which, is, 3, of, the, mass, of, the, moon, the, four, largest, objects, ceres, vesta, pallas, and, hygiea, contain, an, estimated, 62, of, the, belt, s, total, mass, with, 39, accounted, for, by, ceres, alone, the, present, day, belt, consists, primarily, of, three, categories, of, asteroids, c, type, carbonaceous, asteroids, s, type, silicate, asteroids, and, a, hybrid, group, of, x, type, asteroids, the, hybrid, group, have, featureless, spectra, but, they, can, be, divided, into, three, groups, based, on, reflectivity, yielding, the, m, type, metallic, p, type, primitive, and, e, type, enstatite, asteroids, additional, types, have, been, found, that, do, not, fit, within, these, primary, classes, there, is, a, compositional, trend, of, asteroid, types, by, increasing, distance, from, the, sun, in, the, order, of, s, c, p, and, the, spectrally, featureless, d, types, carbonaceous, asteroids, as, their, name, suggests, are, carbon, rich, they, dominate, the, asteroid, belt, s, outer, regions, and, are, rare, in, the, inner, belt, together, they, comprise, over, 75, of, the, visible, asteroids, they, are, redder, in, hue, than, the, other, asteroids, and, have, a, low, albedo, their, surface, compositions, are, similar, to, carbonaceous, chondrite, meteorites, chemically, their, spectra, match, the, primordial, composition, of, the, early, solar, system, with, hydrogen, helium, and, volatiles, removed, s, type, silicate, rich, asteroids, are, more, common, toward, the, inner, region, of, the, belt, within, 2, 5, au, of, the, sun, the, spectra, of, their, surfaces, reveal, the, presence, of, silicates, and, some, metal, but, no, significant, carbonaceous, compounds, this, indicates, that, their, materials, have, been, significantly, modified, from, their, primordial, composition, probably, through, melting, and, reformation, they, have, a, relatively, high, albedo, and, form, about, 17, of, the, total, asteroid, population, m, type, metal, rich, asteroids, are, typically, found, in, the, middle, of, the, main, belt, and, they, make, up, much, of, the, remainder, of, the, total, population, their, spectra, resemble, that, of, iron, nickel, some, are, believed, to, have, formed, from, the, metallic, cores, of, differentiated, progenitor, bodies, that, were, disrupted, through, collision, however, some, silicate, compounds, also, can, produce, a, similar, appearance, for, example, the, large, m, type, asteroid, 22, kalliope, does, not, appear, to, be, primarily, composed, of, metal, within, the, asteroid, belt, the, number, distribution, of, m, type, asteroids, peaks, at, a, semimajor, axis, of, about, 2, 7, au, whether, all, m, types, are, compositionally, similar, or, whether, it, is, a, label, for, several, varieties, which, do, not, fit, neatly, into, the, main, c, and, s, classes, is, not, yet, clear, one, mystery, is, the, relative, rarity, of, v, type, vestoid, or, basaltic, asteroids, in, the, asteroid, belt, theories, of, asteroid, formation, predict, that, objects, the, size, of, vesta, or, larger, should, form, crusts, and, mantles, which, would, be, composed, mainly, of, basaltic, rock, resulting, in, more, than, half, of, all, asteroids, being, composed, either, of, basalt, or, of, olivine, however, observations, suggest, that, 99, of, the, predicted, basaltic, material, is, missing, until, 2001, most, basaltic, bodies, discovered, in, the, asteroid, belt, were, believed, to, originate, from, the, asteroid, vesta, hence, their, name, v, type, but, the, discovery, of, the, asteroid, 1459, magnya, revealed, a, slightly, different, chemical, composition, from, the, other, basaltic, asteroids, discovered, until, then, suggesting, a, different, origin, this, hypothesis, was, reinforced, by, the, further, discovery, in, 2007, of, two, asteroids, in, the, outer, belt, 7472, kumakiri, and, 10537, 1991, ry, 16, with, a, differing, basaltic, composition, that, could, not, have, originated, from, vesta, these, two, are, the, only, v, type, asteroids, discovered, in, the, outer, belt, to, date, the, temperature, of, the, asteroid, belt, varies, with, the, distance, from, the, sun, for, dust, particles, within, the, belt, typical, temperatures, range, from, 200, k, 73, c, at, 2, 2, au, down, to, 165, k, 108, c, at, 3, 2, au, however, due, to, rotation, the, surface, temperature, of, an, asteroid, can, vary, considerably, as, the, sides, are, alternately, exposed, to, solar, radiation, then, to, the, stellar, background, several, otherwise, unremarkable, bodies, in, the, outer, belt, show, cometary, activity, because, their, orbits, cannot, be, explained, through, the, capture, of, classical, comets, many, of, the, outer, asteroids, are, thought, to, be, icy, with, the, ice, occasionally, exposed, to, sublimation, through, small, impacts, main, belt, comets, may, have, been, a, major, source, of, the, earth, s, oceans, because, the, deuterium, hydrogen, ratio, is, too, low, for, classical, comets, to, have, been, the, principal, source, most, asteroids, within, the, asteroid, belt, have, orbital, eccentricities, of, less, than, 0, 4, and, an, inclination, of, less, than, 30, the, orbital, distribution, of, the, asteroids, reaches, a, maximum, at, an, eccentricity, around, 0, 07, and, an, inclination, below, 4, thus, although, a, typical, asteroid, has, a, relatively, circular, orbit, and, lies, near, the, plane, of, the, ecliptic, some, asteroid, orbits, can, be, highly, eccentric, or, travel, well, outside, the, ecliptic, plane, sometimes, the, term, main, belt, is, used, to, refer, only, to, the, more, compact, core, region, where, the, greatest, concentration, of, bodies, is, found, this, lies, between, the, strong, 4, 1, and, 2, 1, kirkwood, gaps, at, 2, 06, and, 3, 27, au, and, at, orbital, eccentricities, less, than, roughly, 0, 33, along, with, orbital, inclinations, below, about, 20, as, of, 2006, this, core, region, contained, 93, of, all, discovered, and, numbered, minor, planets, within, the, solar, system, the, jpl, small, body, database, lists, over, 1, million, known, main, belt, asteroids, the, semimajor, axis, of, an, asteroid, is, used, to, describe, the, dimensions, of, its, orbit, around, the, sun, and, its, value, determines, the, minor, planet, s, orbital, period, in, 1866, daniel, kirkwood, announced, the, discovery, of, gaps, in, the, distances, of, these, bodies, orbits, from, the, sun, they, were, located, in, positions, where, their, period, of, revolution, about, the, sun, was, an, integer, fraction, of, jupiter, s, orbital, period, kirkwood, proposed, that, the, gravitational, perturbations, of, the, planet, led, to, the, removal, of, asteroids, from, these, orbits, when, the, mean, orbital, period, of, an, asteroid, is, an, integer, fraction, of, the, orbital, period, of, jupiter, a, mean, motion, resonance, with, the, gas, giant, is, created, that, is, sufficient, to, perturb, an, asteroid, to, new, orbital, elements, primordial, asteroids, entered, these, gaps, because, of, the, migration, of, jupiter, s, orbit, subsequently, asteroids, primarily, migrate, into, these, gap, orbits, due, to, the, yarkovsky, effect, but, may, also, enter, because, of, perturbations, or, collisions, after, entering, an, asteroid, is, gradually, nudged, into, a, different, random, orbit, with, a, larger, or, smaller, semimajor, axis, the, high, population, of, the, asteroid, belt, makes, for, an, active, environment, where, collisions, between, asteroids, occur, frequently, on, deep, time, scales, impact, events, between, main, belt, bodies, with, a, mean, radius, of, 10, km, are, expected, to, occur, about, once, every, 10, million, years, a, collision, may, fragment, an, asteroid, into, numerous, smaller, pieces, leading, to, the, formation, of, a, new, asteroid, family, conversely, collisions, that, occur, at, low, relative, speeds, may, also, join, two, asteroids, after, more, than, 4, billion, years, of, such, processes, the, members, of, the, asteroid, belt, now, bear, little, resemblance, to, the, original, population, evidence, suggests, that, most, main, belt, asteroids, between, 200, m, and, 10, km, in, diameter, are, rubble, piles, formed, by, collisions, these, bodies, consist, of, a, multitude, of, irregular, objects, that, are, mostly, bound, together, by, self, gravity, resulting, in, significant, amounts, of, internal, porosity, along, with, the, asteroid, bodies, the, asteroid, belt, also, contains, bands, of, dust, with, particle, radii, of, up, to, a, few, hundred, micrometres, this, fine, material, is, produced, at, least, in, part, from, collisions, between, asteroids, and, by, the, impact, of, micrometeorites, upon, the, asteroids, due, to, the, poynting, robertson, effect, the, pressure, of, solar, radiation, causes, this, dust, to, slowly, spiral, inward, toward, the, sun, the, combination, of, this, fine, asteroid, dust, as, well, as, ejected, cometary, material, produces, the, zodiacal, light, this, faint, auroral, glow, can, be, viewed, at, night, extending, from, the, direction, of, the, sun, along, the, plane, of, the, ecliptic, asteroid, particles, that, produce, visible, zodiacal, light, average, about, 40, m, in, radius, the, typical, lifetimes, of, main, belt, zodiacal, cloud, particles, are, about, 700, 000, years, thus, to, maintain, the, bands, of, dust, new, particles, must, be, steadily, produced, within, the, asteroid, belt, it, was, once, thought, that, collisions, of, asteroids, form, a, major, component, of, the, zodiacal, light, however, computer, simulations, by, nesvorn, and, colleagues, attributed, 85, percent, of, the, zodiacal, light, dust, to, fragmentations, of, jupiter, family, comets, rather, than, to, comets, and, collisions, between, asteroids, in, the, asteroid, belt, at, most, 10, percent, of, the, dust, is, attributed, to, the, asteroid, belt, some, of, the, debris, from, collisions, can, form, meteoroids, that, enter, the, earth, s, atmosphere, of, the, 50, 000, meteorites, found, on, earth, to, date, 99, 8, percent, are, believed, to, have, originated, in, the, asteroid, belt, in, 1918, the, japanese, astronomer, kiyotsugu, hirayama, noticed, that, the, orbits, of, some, of, the, asteroids, had, similar, parameters, forming, families, or, groups, approximately, one, third, of, the, asteroids, in, the, asteroid, belt, are, members, of, an, asteroid, family, these, share, similar, orbital, elements, such, as, semi, major, axis, eccentricity, and, orbital, inclination, as, well, as, similar, spectral, features, which, indicate, a, common, origin, in, the, breakup, of, a, larger, body, graphical, displays, of, these, element, pairs, for, members, of, the, asteroid, belt, show, concentrations, indicating, the, presence, of, an, asteroid, family, there, are, about, 20, to, 30, associations, that, are, likely, asteroid, families, additional, groupings, have, been, found, that, are, less, certain, asteroid, families, can, be, confirmed, when, the, members, display, similar, spectral, features, smaller, associations, of, asteroids, are, called, groups, or, clusters, some, of, the, most, prominent, families, in, the, asteroid, belt, in, order, of, increasing, semi, major, axes, are, the, flora, eunomia, koronis, eos, and, themis, families, the, flora, family, one, of, the, largest, with, more, than, 800, known, members, may, have, formed, from, a, collision, less, than, 1, billion, years, ago, the, largest, asteroid, to, be, a, true, member, of, a, family, is, 4, vesta, this, is, in, contrast, to, an, interloper, in, the, case, of, ceres, with, the, gefion, family, the, vesta, family, is, believed, to, have, formed, as, the, result, of, a, crater, forming, impact, on, vesta, likewise, the, hed, meteorites, may, also, have, originated, from, vesta, as, a, result, of, this, collision, three, prominent, bands, of, dust, have, been, found, within, the, asteroid, belt, these, have, similar, orbital, inclinations, as, the, eos, koronis, and, themis, asteroid, families, and, so, are, possibly, associated, with, those, groupings, the, main, belt, evolution, after, the, late, heavy, bombardment, was, likely, affected, by, the, passages, of, large, centaurs, and, trans, neptunian, objects, tnos, centaurs, and, tnos, that, reach, the, inner, solar, system, can, modify, the, orbits, of, main, belt, asteroids, though, only, if, their, mass, is, of, the, order, of, 10, 9, m, for, single, encounters, or, one, order, less, in, case, of, multiple, close, encounters, however, centaurs, and, tnos, are, unlikely, to, have, significantly, dispersed, young, asteroid, families, in, the, main, belt, although, they, can, have, perturbed, some, old, asteroid, families, current, main, belt, asteroids, that, originated, as, centaurs, or, trans, neptunian, objects, may, lie, in, the, outer, belt, with, short, lifetime, of, less, than, 4, million, years, most, likely, orbiting, between, 2, 8, and, 3, 2, au, at, larger, eccentricities, than, typical, of, main, belt, asteroids, skirting, the, inner, edge, of, the, belt, ranging, between, 1, 78, and, 2, 0, au, with, a, mean, semi, major, axis, of, 1, 9, au, is, the, hungaria, family, of, minor, planets, they, are, named, after, the, main, member, 434, hungaria, the, group, contains, at, least, 52, named, asteroids, the, hungaria, group, is, separated, from, the, main, body, by, the, 4, 1, kirkwood, gap, and, their, orbits, have, a, high, inclination, some, members, belong, to, the, mars, crossing, category, of, asteroids, and, gravitational, perturbations, by, mars, are, likely, a, factor, in, reducing, the, total, population, of, this, group, another, high, inclination, group, in, the, inner, part, of, the, asteroid, belt, is, the, phocaea, family, these, are, composed, primarily, of, s, type, asteroids, whereas, the, neighboring, hungaria, family, includes, some, e, types, the, phocaea, family, orbit, between, 2, 25, and, 2, 5, au, from, the, sun, skirting, the, outer, edge, of, the, asteroid, belt, is, the, cybele, group, orbiting, between, 3, 3, and, 3, 5, au, these, have, a, 7, 4, orbital, resonance, with, jupiter, the, hilda, family, orbit, between, 3, 5, and, 4, 2, au, with, relatively, circular, orbits, and, a, stable, 3, 2, orbital, resonance, with, jupiter, there, are, few, asteroids, beyond, 4, 2, au, until, jupiter, s, orbit, at, the, latter, the, two, families, of, trojan, asteroids, can, be, found, which, at, least, for, objects, larger, than, 1, km, are, approximately, as, numerous, as, the, asteroids, of, the, asteroid, belt, some, asteroid, families, have, formed, recently, in, astronomical, terms, the, karin, family, apparently, formed, about, 5, 7, million, years, ago, from, a, collision, with, a, progenitor, asteroid, 33, km, in, radius, the, veritas, family, formed, about, 8, 3, million, years, ago, evidence, includes, interplanetary, dust, recovered, from, ocean, sediment, more, recently, the, datura, cluster, appears, to, have, formed, about, 530, 000, years, ago, from, a, collision, with, a, main, belt, asteroid, the, age, estimate, is, based, on, the, probability, of, the, members, having, their, current, orbits, rather, than, from, any, physical, evidence, however, this, cluster, may, have, been, a, source, for, some, zodiacal, dust, material, other, recent, cluster, formations, such, as, the, iannini, cluster, c, 1, 5, million, years, ago, may, have, provided, additional, sources, of, this, asteroid, dust, the, first, spacecraft, to, traverse, the, asteroid, belt, was, pioneer, 10, which, entered, the, region, on, 16, july, 1972, at, the, time, there, was, some, concern, that, the, debris, in, the, belt, would, pose, a, hazard, to, the, spacecraft, but, it, has, since, been, safely, traversed, by, multiple, spacecraft, without, incident, pioneer, 11, voyagers, 1, and, 2, and, ulysses, passed, through, the, belt, without, imaging, any, asteroids, cassini, measured, plasma, and, fine, dust, grains, while, traversing, the, belt, in, 2000, on, its, way, to, jupiter, juno, traversed, the, asteroid, belt, without, collecting, science, data, due, to, the, low, density, of, materials, within, the, belt, the, odds, of, a, probe, running, into, an, asteroid, are, estimated, at, less, than, 1, in, 1, billion, most, main, belt, asteroids, imaged, to, date, have, come, from, brief, flyby, opportunities, by, probes, headed, for, other, targets, only, the, dawn, mission, has, studied, main, belt, asteroids, for, a, protracted, period, in, orbit, the, galileo, spacecraft, imaged, 951, gaspra, in, 1991, and, 243, ida, in, 1993, then, near, imaged, 253, mathilde, in, 1997, and, landed, on, near, earth, asteroid, 433, eros, in, february, 2001, cassini, imaged, 2685, masursky, in, 2000, stardust, imaged,

2011, and, september, 2012, and, has, orbited, ceres, since, march, 2015, the, lucy, space, probe, made, a, flyby, of, 152830, dinkinesh, in, 2023, on, its, way, to, the, jupiter, trojans, esa, s, juice, mission, will, pass, through, the, asteroid, belt, twice, with, a, proposed, flyby, of, the, asteroid, 223, rosa, in, 2029, the, psyche, spacecraft, is, a, nasa, mission, to, the, large, m,
