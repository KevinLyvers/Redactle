https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie
the, calorie, is, a, unit, of, energy, that, originated, from, the, caloric, theory, of, heat, the, large, calorie, food, calorie, dietary, calorie, or, kilogram, calorie, is, defined, as, the, amount, of, heat, needed, to, raise, the, temperature, of, one, liter, of, water, by, one, degree, celsius, or, one, kelvin, the, small, calorie, or, gram, calorie, is, defined, as, the, amount, of, heat, needed, to, cause, the, same, increase, in, one, milliliter, of, water, thus, 1, large, calorie, is, equal, to, 1000, small, calories, in, nutrition, and, food, science, the, term, calorie, and, the, symbol, cal, may, refer, to, the, large, unit, or, to, the, small, unit, in, different, regions, of, the, world, it, is, generally, used, in, publications, and, package, labels, to, express, the, energy, value, of, foods, in, per, serving, or, per, weight, recommended, dietary, caloric, intake, metabolic, rates, etc, some, authors, recommend, the, spelling, calorie, and, the, symbol, cal, both, with, a, capital, c, if, the, large, calorie, is, meant, to, avoid, confusion, however, this, convention, is, often, ignored, in, physics, and, chemistry, the, word, calorie, and, its, symbol, usually, refer, to, the, small, unit, the, large, one, being, called, kilocalorie, kcal, however, the, kcal, is, not, officially, part, of, the, international, system, of, units, si, and, is, regarded, as, obsolete, having, been, replaced, in, many, uses, by, the, si, derived, unit, of, energy, the, joule, j, or, the, kilojoule, kj, for, 1000, joules, the, precise, equivalence, between, calories, and, joules, has, varied, over, the, years, but, in, thermochemistry, and, nutrition, it, is, now, generally, assumed, that, one, small, calorie, thermochemical, calorie, is, equal, to, exactly, 4, 184, j, and, therefore, one, kilocalorie, one, large, calorie, is, 4184, j, or, 4, 184, kj, the, term, calorie, comes, from, latin, calor, heat, it, was, first, introduced, by, nicolas, cl, ment, as, a, unit, of, heat, energy, in, lectures, on, experimental, calorimetry, during, the, years, 1819, 1824, this, was, the, large, calorie, the, term, written, with, lowercase, c, entered, french, and, english, dictionaries, between, 1841, and, 1867, the, same, term, was, used, for, the, small, unit, by, pierre, antoine, favre, chemist, and, johann, t, silbermann, physicist, in, 1852, in, 1879, marcellin, berthelot, distinguished, between, gram, calorie, and, kilogram, calorie, and, proposed, using, calorie, with, capital, c, for, the, large, unit, this, usage, was, adopted, by, wilbur, olin, atwater, a, professor, at, wesleyan, university, in, 1887, in, an, influential, article, on, the, energy, content, of, food, the, smaller, unit, was, used, by, u, s, physician, joseph, howard, raymond, in, his, classic, 1894, textbook, a, manual, of, human, physiology, he, proposed, calling, the, large, unit, kilocalorie, but, the, term, did, not, catch, on, until, some, years, later, the, small, calorie, cal, was, recognized, as, a, unit, of, the, cgs, system, in, 1896, alongside, the, already, existing, cgs, unit, of, energy, the, erg, first, suggested, by, clausius, in, 1864, under, the, name, ergon, and, officially, adopted, in, 1882, in, 1928, there, were, already, serious, complaints, about, the, possible, confusion, arising, from, the, two, main, definitions, of, the, calorie, and, whether, the, notion, of, using, the, capital, letter, to, distinguish, them, was, sound, the, joule, was, the, officially, adopted, si, unit, of, energy, at, the, ninth, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, in, 1948, the, calorie, was, mentioned, in, the, 7th, edition, of, the, si, brochure, as, an, example, of, a, non, si, unit, the, alternate, spelling, calory, is, a, less, common, non, standard, variant, the, small, calorie, is, broadly, defined, as, the, amount, of, energy, needed, to, increase, the, temperature, of, 1, gram, of, water, by, 1, c, or, 1, k, which, is, the, same, increment, a, gradation, of, one, percent, of, the, interval, between, the, melting, point, and, the, boiling, point, of, water, the, actual, amount, of, energy, required, to, accomplish, this, temperature, increase, depends, on, the, atmospheric, pressure, and, the, starting, temperature, different, choices, of, these, parameters, have, resulted, in, several, different, precise, definitions, of, the, unit, 0, 003, 964, btu, 1, 162, 10, 6, kw, h, 2, 611, 10, 19, ev, 0, 003, 985, btu, 1, 168, 10, 6, kw, h, 2, 624, 10, 19, ev, 0, 003, 9671, btu, 1, 1626, 10, 6, kw, h, 2, 6124, 10, 19, ev, 0, 003, 964, btu, 1, 162, 10, 6, kw, h, 2, 610, 10, 19, ev, 0, 003, 971, btu, 1, 164, 10, 6, kw, h, 2, 615, 10, 19, ev, 0, 003, 9683, btu, 1, 1630, 10, 6, kw, h, 2, 6132, 10, 19, ev, 0, 003, 9683, btu, 1, 1630, 10, 6, kw, h, 2, 6132, 10, 19, ev, the, two, definitions, most, common, in, older, literature, appear, to, be, the, 15, c, calorie, and, the, thermochemical, calorie, until, 1948, the, latter, was, defined, as, 4, 1833, international, joules, the, current, standard, of, 4, 184, j, was, chosen, to, have, the, new, thermochemical, calorie, represent, the, same, quantity, of, energy, as, before, in, the, united, states, in, a, nutritional, context, the, large, unit, is, used, almost, exclusively, it, is, generally, written, calorie, with, lowercase, c, and, symbol, cal, even, in, government, publications, the, si, unit, kilojoule, kj, may, be, used, instead, in, legal, or, scientific, contexts, most, american, nutritionists, prefer, the, unit, kilocalorie, to, the, unit, kilojoules, whereas, most, physiologists, prefer, to, use, kilojoules, in, the, majority, of, other, countries, nutritionists, prefer, the, kilojoule, to, the, kilocalorie, in, the, european, union, on, nutrition, facts, labels, energy, is, expressed, in, both, kilojoules, and, kilocalories, abbreviated, as, kj, and, kcal, respectively, in, china, only, kilojoules, are, given, the, unit, is, most, commonly, used, to, express, food, energy, namely, the, specific, energy, energy, per, mass, of, metabolizing, different, types, of, food, for, example, fat, triglyceride, lipids, contains, 9, kilocalories, per, gram, kcal, g, while, carbohydrates, sugar, and, starch, and, protein, contain, approximately, 4, kcal, g, alcohol, in, food, contains, 7, kcal, g, the, large, unit, is, also, used, to, express, recommended, nutritional, intake, or, consumption, as, in, calories, per, day, dieting, is, the, practice, of, eating, food, in, a, regulated, way, to, decrease, maintain, or, increase, body, weight, or, to, prevent, and, treat, diseases, such, as, diabetes, and, obesity, as, weight, loss, depends, on, reducing, caloric, intake, different, kinds, of, calorie, reduced, diets, have, been, shown, to, be, generally, effective, in, other, scientific, contexts, the, term, calorie, and, the, symbol, cal, almost, always, refers, to, the, small, unit, the, large, unit, being, generally, called, kilocalorie, with, symbol, kcal, it, is, mostly, used, to, express, the, amount, of, energy, released, in, a, chemical, reaction, or, phase, change, typically, per, mole, of, substance, as, in, kilocalories, per, mole, it, is, also, occasionally, used, to, specify, other, energy, quantities, that, relate, to, reaction, energy, such, as, enthalpy, of, formation, and, the, size, of, activation, barriers, however, it, is, increasingly, being, superseded, by, the, si, unit, the, joule, j, and, metric, multiples, thereof, such, as, the, kilojoule, kj, the, lingering, use, in, chemistry, is, largely, due, to, the, fact, that, the, energy, released, by, a, reaction, in, aqueous, solution, expressed, in, kilocalories, per, mole, of, reagent, is, numerically, close, to, the, concentration, of, the, reagent, in, moles, per, liter, multiplied, by, the, change, in, the, temperature, of, the, solution, in, kelvins, or, degrees, celsius, however, this, estimate, assumes, that, the, volumetric, heat, capacity, of, the, solution, is, 1, kcal, l, k, which, is, not, exact, even, for, pure, water
