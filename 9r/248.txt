a, nova, pl, novae, or, novas, is, a, transient, astronomical, event, that, causes, the, sudden, appearance, of, a, bright, apparently, new, star, hence, the, name, nova, latin, for, new, that, slowly, fades, over, weeks, or, months, all, observed, novae, involve, white, dwarfs, in, close, binary, systems, but, causes, of, the, dramatic, appearance, of, a, nova, vary, depending, on, the, circumstances, of, the, two, progenitor, stars, the, main, sub, classes, of, novae, are, classical, novae, recurrent, novae, rne, and, dwarf, novae, they, are, all, considered, to, be, cataclysmic, variable, stars, classical, nova, eruptions, are, the, most, common, type, this, type, is, usually, created, in, a, close, binary, star, system, consisting, of, a, white, dwarf, and, either, a, main, sequence, subgiant, or, red, giant, star, if, the, orbital, period, of, the, system, is, a, few, days, or, less, the, white, dwarf, is, close, enough, to, its, companion, star, to, draw, accreted, matter, onto, its, surface, creating, a, dense, but, shallow, atmosphere, this, atmosphere, mostly, consisting, of, hydrogen, is, heated, by, the, hot, white, dwarf, and, eventually, reaches, a, critical, temperature, causing, ignition, of, rapid, runaway, fusion, the, sudden, increase, in, energy, expels, the, atmosphere, into, interstellar, space, creating, the, envelope, seen, as, visible, light, during, the, nova, event, in, past, centuries, such, an, event, was, thought, to, be, a, new, star, a, few, novae, produce, short, lived, nova, remnants, lasting, for, perhaps, several, centuries, a, recurrent, nova, involves, the, same, processes, as, a, classical, nova, except, that, the, nova, event, repeats, in, cycles, of, a, few, decades, or, less, as, the, companion, star, again, feeds, the, dense, atmosphere, of, the, white, dwarf, after, each, ignition, as, in, the, star, t, coronae, borealis, under, certain, conditions, mass, accretion, can, eventually, trigger, runaway, fusion, that, destroys, the, white, dwarf, rather, than, merely, expelling, its, atmosphere, in, this, case, the, event, is, usually, classified, as, a, type, ia, supernova, novae, most, often, occur, in, the, sky, along, the, path, of, the, milky, way, especially, near, the, observed, galactic, center, in, sagittarius, however, they, can, appear, anywhere, in, the, sky, they, occur, far, more, frequently, than, galactic, supernovae, averaging, about, ten, per, year, in, the, milky, way, most, are, found, telescopically, perhaps, only, one, every, 12, 18, months, reaching, naked, eye, visibility, novae, reaching, first, or, second, magnitude, occur, only, a, few, times, per, century, the, last, bright, nova, was, v1369, centauri, which, reached, 3, 3, magnitude, on, 14, december, 2013, during, the, sixteenth, century, astronomer, tycho, brahe, observed, the, supernova, sn, 1572, in, the, constellation, cassiopeia, he, described, it, in, his, book, de, nova, stella, latin, for, concerning, the, new, star, giving, rise, to, the, adoption, of, the, name, nova, in, this, work, he, argued, that, a, nearby, object, should, be, seen, to, move, relative, to, the, fixed, stars, and, thus, the, nova, had, to, be, very, far, away, although, sn, 1572, was, later, found, to, be, a, supernova, and, not, a, nova, the, terms, were, considered, interchangeable, until, the, 1930s, after, this, novae, were, called, classical, novae, to, distinguish, them, from, supernovae, as, their, causes, and, energies, were, thought, to, be, different, based, solely, on, the, observational, evidence, although, the, term, stella, nova, means, new, star, novae, most, often, take, place, on, white, dwarfs, which, are, remnants, of, extremely, old, stars, evolution, of, potential, novae, begins, with, two, main, sequence, stars, in, a, binary, system, one, of, the, two, evolves, into, a, red, giant, leaving, its, remnant, white, dwarf, core, in, orbit, with, the, remaining, star, the, second, star, which, may, be, either, a, main, sequence, star, or, an, aging, giant, begins, to, shed, its, envelope, onto, its, white, dwarf, companion, when, it, overflows, its, roche, lobe, as, a, result, the, white, dwarf, steadily, captures, matter, from, the, companion, s, outer, atmosphere, in, an, accretion, disk, and, in, turn, the, accreted, matter, falls, into, the, atmosphere, as, the, white, dwarf, consists, of, degenerate, matter, the, accreted, hydrogen, is, unable, to, expand, even, though, its, temperature, increases, runaway, fusion, occurs, when, the, temperature, of, this, atmospheric, layer, reaches, 20, million, k, initiating, nuclear, burning, via, the, cno, cycle, if, the, accretion, rate, is, just, right, hydrogen, fusion, may, occur, in, a, stable, manner, on, the, surface, of, the, white, dwarf, giving, rise, to, a, supersoft, x, ray, source, but, for, most, binary, system, parameters, the, hydrogen, burning, is, thermally, unstable, and, rapidly, converts, a, large, amount, of, the, hydrogen, into, other, heavier, chemical, elements, in, a, runaway, reaction, liberating, an, enormous, amount, of, energy, this, blows, the, remaining, gases, away, from, the, surface, of, the, white, dwarf, and, produces, an, extremely, bright, outburst, of, light, the, rise, to, peak, brightness, may, be, very, rapid, or, gradual, after, the, peak, the, brightness, declines, steadily, the, time, taken, for, a, nova, to, decay, by, 2, or, 3, magnitudes, from, maximum, optical, brightness, is, used, for, grouping, novae, into, speed, classes, fast, novae, typically, will, take, less, than, 25, days, to, decay, by, 2, magnitudes, while, slow, novae, will, take, more, than, 80, days, despite, its, violence, usually, the, amount, of, material, ejected, in, a, nova, is, only, about, 1, 10, 000, of, a, solar, mass, quite, small, relative, to, the, mass, of, the, white, dwarf, furthermore, only, five, percent, of, the, accreted, mass, is, fused, during, the, power, outburst, nonetheless, this, is, enough, energy, to, accelerate, nova, ejecta, to, velocities, as, high, as, several, thousand, kilometers, per, second, higher, for, fast, novae, than, slow, ones, with, a, concurrent, rise, in, luminosity, from, a, few, times, solar, to, 50, 000, 100, 000, times, solar, in, 2010, scientists, using, nasa, s, fermi, gamma, ray, space, telescope, discovered, that, a, nova, also, can, emit, gamma, rays, 100, mev, potentially, a, white, dwarf, can, generate, multiple, novae, over, time, as, additional, hydrogen, continues, to, accrete, onto, its, surface, from, its, companion, star, where, this, repeated, flaring, is, observed, the, object, is, called, a, recurrent, nova, an, example, is, rs, ophiuchi, which, is, known, to, have, flared, seven, times, in, 1898, 1933, 1958, 1967, 1985, 2006, and, 2021, eventually, the, white, dwarf, can, explode, as, a, type, ia, supernova, if, it, approaches, the, chandrasekhar, limit, occasionally, novae, are, bright, enough, and, close, enough, to, earth, to, be, conspicuous, to, the, unaided, eye, the, brightest, recent, example, was, nova, cygni, 1975, this, nova, appeared, on, 29, august, 1975, in, the, constellation, cygnus, about, 5, degrees, north, of, deneb, and, reached, magnitude, 2, 0, nearly, as, bright, as, deneb, the, most, recent, were, v1280, scorpii, which, reached, magnitude, 3, 7, on, 17, february, 2007, and, nova, delphini, 2013, nova, centauri, 2013, was, discovered, 2, december, 2013, and, so, far, is, the, brightest, nova, of, this, millennium, reaching, magnitude, 3, 3, a, helium, nova, undergoing, a, helium, flash, is, a, proposed, category, of, nova, event, that, lacks, hydrogen, lines, in, its, spectrum, the, absence, of, hydrogen, lines, may, be, caused, by, the, explosion, of, a, helium, shell, on, a, white, dwarf, the, theory, was, first, proposed, in, 1989, and, the, first, candidate, helium, nova, to, be, observed, was, v445, puppis, in, 2000, since, then, four, other, novae, have, been, proposed, as, helium, novae, astronomers, have, estimated, that, the, milky, way, experiences, roughly, 25, to, 75, novae, per, year, the, number, of, novae, actually, observed, in, the, milky, way, each, year, is, much, lower, about, 10, probably, because, distant, novae, are, obscured, by, gas, and, dust, absorption, as, of, 2019, 407, probable, novae, had, been, recorded, in, the, milky, way, in, the, andromeda, galaxy, roughly, 25, novae, brighter, than, about, 20th, magnitude, are, discovered, each, year, and, smaller, numbers, are, seen, in, other, nearby, galaxies, spectroscopic, observation, of, nova, ejecta, nebulae, has, shown, that, they, are, enriched, in, elements, such, as, helium, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, neon, and, magnesium, classical, nova, explosions, are, galactic, producers, of, the, element, lithium, the, contribution, of, novae, to, the, interstellar, medium, is, not, great, novae, supply, only, 1, 50, as, much, material, to, the, galaxy, as, do, supernovae, and, only, 1, 200, as, much, as, red, giant, and, supergiant, stars, observed, recurrent, novae, such, as, rs, ophiuchi, those, with, periods, on, the, order, of, decades, are, rare, astronomers, theorize, however, that, most, if, not, all, novae, recur, albeit, on, time, scales, ranging, from, 1, 000, to, 100, 000, years, the, recurrence, interval, for, a, nova, is, less, dependent, on, the, accretion, rate, of, the, white, dwarf, than, on, its, mass, with, their, powerful, gravity, massive, white, dwarfs, require, less, accretion, to, fuel, an, eruption, than, lower, mass, ones, consequently, the, interval, is, shorter, for, high, mass, white, dwarfs, v, sagittae, is, unusual, in, that, the, time, of, its, next, eruption, can, be, predicted, fairly, accurately, it, is, expected, to, recur, in, approximately, 2083, plus, or, minus, about, 11, years, novae, are, classified, according, to, the, light, curve, decay, speed, referred, to, as, either, type, a, b, c, and, r, or, using, the, prefix, n, some, novae, leave, behind, visible, nebulosity, material, expelled, in, the, nova, explosion, or, in, multiple, explosions, novae, have, some, promise, for, use, as, standard, candle, measurements, of, distances, for, instance, the, distribution, of, their, absolute, magnitude, is, bimodal, with, a, main, peak, at, magnitude, 8, 8, and, a, lesser, one, at, 7, 5, novae, also, have, roughly, the, same, absolute, magnitude, 15, days, after, their, peak, 5, 5, nova, based, distance, estimates, to, various, nearby, galaxies, and, galaxy, clusters, have, been, shown, to, be, of, comparable, accuracy, to, those, measured, with, cepheid, variable, stars, a, recurrent, nova, rne, is, an, object, that, has, been, seen, to, experience, repeated, nova, eruptions, the, recurrent, nova, typically, brightens, by, about, 9, magnitudes, whereas, a, classic, nova, may, brighten, by, more, than, 12, magnitudes, although, it, is, estimated, that, as, many, as, a, quarter, of, nova, systems, experience, multiple, eruptions, only, ten, recurrent, novae, listed, below, have, been, observed, in, the, milky, way, several, extragalactic, recurrent, novae, have, been, observed, in, the, andromeda, galaxy, m31, and, the, large, magellanic, cloud, one, of, these, extragalactic, novae, m31n, 2008, 12a, erupts, as, frequently, as, once, every, 12, months, on, 20, april, 2016, the, sky, telescope, website, reported, a, sustained, brightening, of, t, coronae, borealis, from, magnitude, 10, 5, to, about, 9, 2, starting, in, february, 2015, a, similar, event, had, been, reported, in, 1938, followed, by, another, outburst, in, 1946, by, june, 2018, the, star, had, dimmed, slightly, but, still, remained, at, an, unusually, high, level, of, activity, in, march, or, april, 2023, it, dimmed, to, magnitude, 12, 3, a, similar, dimming, occurred, in, the, year, before, the, 1945, outburst, indicating, that, it, will, likely, erupt, between, march, and, september, 2024, novae, are, relatively, common, in, the, andromeda, galaxy, m31, several, dozen, novae, brighter, than, apparent, magnitude, 20, are, discovered, in, m31, each, year, the, central, bureau, for, astronomical, telegrams, cbat, has, tracked, novae, in, m31, m33, and, m81
