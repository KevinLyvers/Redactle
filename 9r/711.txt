a, swamp, is, a, forested, wetland, swamps, are, considered, to, be, transition, zones, because, both, land, and, water, play, a, role, in, creating, this, environment, swamps, vary, in, size, and, are, located, all, around, the, world, the, water, of, a, swamp, may, be, fresh, water, brackish, water, or, seawater, freshwater, swamps, form, along, large, rivers, or, lakes, where, they, are, critically, dependent, upon, rainwater, and, seasonal, flooding, to, maintain, natural, water, level, fluctuations, saltwater, swamps, are, found, along, tropical, and, subtropical, coastlines, some, swamps, have, hammocks, or, dry, land, protrusions, covered, by, aquatic, vegetation, or, vegetation, that, tolerates, periodic, inundation, or, soil, saturation, the, two, main, types, of, swamp, are, true, or, swamp, forests, and, transitional, or, shrub, swamps, in, the, boreal, regions, of, canada, the, word, swamp, is, colloquially, used, for, what, is, more, formally, termed, a, bog, fen, or, muskeg, some, of, the, world, s, largest, swamps, are, found, along, major, rivers, such, as, the, amazon, the, mississippi, and, the, congo, swamps, and, marshes, are, specific, types, of, wetlands, that, form, along, waterbodies, containing, rich, hydric, soils, marshes, are, wetlands, continually, or, frequently, flooded, by, nearby, running, bodies, of, water, that, are, dominated, by, emergent, soft, stem, vegetation, and, herbaceous, plants, swamps, are, wetlands, consisting, of, saturated, soils, or, standing, water, and, are, dominated, by, water, tolerant, woody, vegetation, such, as, shrubs, bushes, and, trees, swamps, are, characterized, by, their, saturated, soils, and, slow, moving, waters, the, water, that, accumulates, in, swamps, comes, from, a, variety, of, sources, including, precipitation, groundwater, tides, and, or, freshwater, flooding, these, hydrologic, pathways, all, contribute, to, how, energy, and, nutrients, flow, in, and, out, of, the, ecosystem, as, water, flows, through, the, swamp, nutrients, sediment, and, pollutants, are, naturally, filtered, out, chemicals, like, phosphorus, and, nitrogen, that, end, up, in, waterways, get, absorbed, and, used, by, the, aquatic, plants, within, the, swamp, purifying, the, water, any, remaining, or, excess, chemicals, present, will, accumulate, at, the, bottom, of, the, swamp, being, removed, from, the, water, and, buried, within, the, sediment, the, biogeochemical, environment, of, a, swamp, is, dependent, on, its, hydrology, affecting, the, levels, and, availability, of, resources, like, oxygen, nutrients, water, ph, and, toxicity, which, will, influence, the, whole, ecosystem, swamps, and, other, wetlands, have, traditionally, held, a, very, low, property, value, compared, to, fields, prairies, or, woodlands, they, have, a, reputation, for, being, unproductive, land, that, cannot, easily, be, utilized, for, human, activities, other, than, hunting, trapping, or, fishing, farmers, for, example, typically, drained, swamps, next, to, their, fields, so, as, to, gain, more, land, usable, for, planting, crops, both, historically, and, to, a, lesser, extent, presently, on, the, other, hand, swamps, can, and, do, play, a, beneficial, ecological, role, in, the, overall, functions, of, the, natural, environment, and, provide, a, variety, of, resources, that, many, species, depend, on, swamps, and, other, wetlands, have, shown, to, be, a, natural, form, of, flood, management, and, defense, against, flooding, in, such, circumstances, where, flooding, does, occur, swamps, absorb, and, use, the, excess, water, within, the, wetland, preventing, it, from, traveling, and, flooding, surrounding, areas, dense, vegetation, within, the, swamp, also, provides, soil, stability, to, the, land, holding, soils, and, sediment, in, place, whilst, preventing, erosion, and, land, loss, swamps, are, an, abundant, and, valuable, source, of, fresh, water, and, oxygen, for, all, life, and, they, are, often, breeding, grounds, for, a, wide, variety, of, species, floodplain, swamps, are, an, important, resource, in, the, production, and, distribution, of, fish, two, thirds, of, global, fish, and, shellfish, are, commercially, harvested, and, dependent, on, wetlands, historically, humans, have, been, known, to, drain, and, or, fill, swamps, and, other, wetlands, in, order, to, create, more, space, for, human, development, and, to, reduce, the, threat, of, diseases, borne, by, swamp, insects, wetlands, are, removed, and, replaced, with, land, that, is, then, used, for, things, like, agriculture, real, estate, and, recreational, uses, many, swamps, have, also, undergone, intensive, logging, and, farming, requiring, the, construction, of, drainage, ditches, and, canals, these, ditches, and, canals, contributed, to, drainage, and, along, the, coast, allowed, salt, water, to, intrude, converting, swamps, to, marsh, or, even, to, open, water, large, areas, of, swamp, were, therefore, lost, or, degraded, louisiana, provides, a, classic, example, of, wetland, loss, from, these, combined, factors, europe, has, likely, lost, nearly, half, its, wetlands, new, zealand, lost, 90, percent, of, its, wetlands, over, a, period, of, 150, years, ecologists, recognize, that, swamps, provide, ecological, services, including, flood, control, fish, production, water, purification, carbon, storage, and, wildlife, habitats, in, many, parts, of, the, world, authorities, protect, swamps, in, parts, of, europe, and, north, america, swamp, restoration, projects, are, becoming, widespread, the, united, states, government, began, enforcing, stricter, laws, and, management, programs, in, the, 1970s, in, efforts, to, protect, and, restore, these, ecosystems, often, the, simplest, steps, to, restoring, swamps, involve, plugging, drainage, ditches, and, removing, levees, conservationists, work, to, preserve, swamps, such, as, those, in, northwest, indiana, in, the, united, states, midwest, that, were, preserved, as, part, of, the, indiana, dunes, swamps, can, be, found, on, all, continents, except, antarctica, the, largest, swamp, in, the, world, is, the, amazon, river, floodplain, which, is, particularly, significant, for, its, large, number, of, fish, and, tree, species, the, sudd, and, the, okavango, delta, are, africa, s, best, known, marshland, areas, the, bangweulu, floodplains, make, up, africa, s, largest, swamp, the, mesopotamian, marshes, is, a, large, swamp, and, river, system, in, southern, iraq, traditionally, inhabited, in, part, by, the, marsh, arabs, in, asia, tropical, peat, swamps, are, located, in, mainland, east, asia, and, southeast, asia, in, southeast, asia, peatlands, are, mainly, found, in, low, altitude, coastal, and, sub, coastal, areas, and, extend, inland, for, distance, more, than, 100, km, 62, mi, along, river, valleys, and, across, watersheds, they, are, mostly, to, be, found, on, the, coasts, of, east, sumatra, kalimantan, central, east, south, and, west, kalimantan, provinces, west, papua, papua, new, guinea, brunei, peninsular, malaya,

the, russian, federation, this, is, one, of, the, largest, swamps, in, the, world, covering, an, area, larger, than, switzerland, the, atchafalaya, swamp, at, the, lower, end, of, the, mississippi, river, is, the, largest, swamp, in, the, united, states, it, is, an, important, example, of, southern, cypress, swamp, but, it, has, been, greatly, altered, by, logging, drainage, and, levee, construction, other, famous, swamps, in, the, united, states, are, the, forested, portions, of, the, everglades, okefenokee, swamp, barley, barber, swamp, great, cypress, swamp, and, the, great,
