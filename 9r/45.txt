the, newton, symbol, n, is, the, unit, of, force, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, it, is, defined, as, 1, kg, m, s, 2, displaystyle, 1, text, kg, cdot, text, m, s, 2, the, force, which, gives, a, mass, of, 1, kilogram, an, acceleration, of, 1, metre, per, second, squared, it, is, named, after, isaac, newton, in, recognition, of, his, work, on, classical, mechanics, specifically, his, second, law, of, motion, a, newton, is, defined, as, 1, k, g, m, s, 2, displaystyle, mathrm, 1, kg, cdot, m, s, 2, it, is, a, named, derived, unit, defined, in, terms, of, the, si, base, units, 137, one, newton, is, therefore, the, force, needed, to, accelerate, one, kilogram, of, mass, at, the, rate, of, one, metre, per, second, squared, in, the, direction, of, the, applied, force, the, units, metre, per, second, squared, can, be, understood, as, measuring, a, rate, of, change, in, velocity, per, unit, of, time, i, e, an, increase, in, velocity, by, 1, metre, per, second, every, second, in, 1946, the, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, cgpm, resolution, 2, standardized, the, unit, of, force, in, the, mks, system, of, units, to, be, the, amount, needed, to, accelerate, 1, kilogram, of, mass, at, the, rate, of, 1, metre, per, second, squared, in, 1948, the, 9th, cgpm, resolution, 7, adopted, the, name, newton, for, this, force, the, mks, system, then, became, the, blueprint, for, today, s, si, system, of, units, the, newton, thus, became, the, standard, unit, of, force, in, the, syst, me, international, d, unit, s, si, or, international, system, of, units, the, newton, is, named, after, isaac, newton, as, with, every, si, unit, named, for, a, person, its, symbol, starts, with, an, upper, case, letter, n, but, when, written, in, full, it, follows, the, rules, for, capitalisation, of, a, common, noun, i, e, newton, becomes, capitalised, at, the, beginning, of, a, sentence, and, in, titles, but, is, otherwise, in, lower, case, the, connection, to, newton, comes, from, newton, s, second, law, of, motion, which, states, that, the, force, exerted, on, an, object, is, directly, proportional, to, the, acceleration, hence, acquired, by, that, object, thus, f, m, a, displaystyle, f, ma, where, m, displaystyle, m, represents, the, mass, of, the, object, undergoing, an, acceleration, a, displaystyle, a, when, using, the, si, unit, of, mass, the, kilogram, kg, displaystyle, text, kg, and, si, units, for, distance, metre, m, displaystyle, text, m, and, time, second, s, displaystyle, text, s, we, arrive, at, the, si, definition, of, the, newton, 1, k, g, m, s, 2, displaystyle, mathrm, 1, kg, cdot, m, s, 2, at, average, gravity, on, earth, conventionally, g, 9, 80665, m, s, 2, displaystyle, g, 9, 80665, text, m, s, 2, a, kilogram, mass, exerts, a, force, of, about, 9, 8, newtons, large, forces, may, be, expressed, in, kilonewtons, kn, where, 1, kn, 1000, n, for, example, the, tractive, effort, of, a, class, y, steam, train, locomotive, and, the, thrust, of, an, f100, jet, engine, are, both, around, 130, kn, climbing, ropes, are, tested, by, assuming, a, human, can, withstand, a, fall, that, creates, 12, kn, of, force, the, ropes, must, not, break, when, tested, against, 5, such, falls, 11
