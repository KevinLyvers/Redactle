ton, is, any, of, several, units, of, measure, of, mass, volume, or, force, it, has, a, long, history, and, has, acquired, several, meanings, and, uses, as, a, unit, of, mass, ton, can, mean, its, original, use, as, a, unit, of, volume, has, continued, in, the, capacity, of, cargo, ships, and, in, units, such, as, the, freight, ton, and, a, number, of, other, units, ranging, from, 35, to, 100, cubic, feet, 0, 99, to, 2, 83, m, 3, in, size, recent, specialized, uses, include, the, ton, as, a, means, of, truck, classification, it, can, also, be, used, as, a, unit, of, energy, or, in, refrigeration, as, a, unit, of, power, sometimes, called, a, ton, of, refrigeration, because, the, ton, of, any, system, of, measuring, weight, is, usually, the, heaviest, unit, named, in, colloquial, speech, its, name, also, has, figurative, uses, singular, and, plural, informally, meaning, a, large, amount, or, quantity, or, to, a, great, degree, as, in, there, s, a, ton, of, bees, in, this, hive, we, have, tons, of, homework, and, i, love, you, a, ton, the, ton, is, derived, from, the, tun, the, term, applied, to, a, cask, of, the, largest, capacity, this, could, contain, a, volume, between, 175, and, 213, imperial, gallons, 210, and, 256, us, gal, 800, and, 970, l, which, could, weigh, around, 2, 000, pounds, 910, kg, and, occupy, some, 60, cubic, feet, 1, 7, m, 3, of, space, there, are, several, similar, units, of, mass, or, volume, called, the, ton, the, difference, between, the, short, ton, and, the, other, common, forms, long, and, metric, is, about, 10, while, the, metric, and, long, tons, differ, by, less, than, 2, the, metric, tonne, is, usually, distinguished, by, its, spelling, when, written, but, in, the, united, states, and, united, kingdom, it, is, pronounced, the, same, as, ton, hence, is, often, spoken, as, metric, ton, when, it, is, necessary, to, make, the, distinction, in, the, united, kingdom, the, final, e, of, tonne, can, also, be, pronounced, t, n, i, in, australia, it, is, pronounced, t, n, in, ireland, and, most, members, of, the, commonwealth, of, nations, a, ton, is, defined, as, 2, 240, pounds, 1, 016, 04691, kg, in, the, united, states, and, canada, a, ton, is, defined, as, 2, 000, pounds, 907, 18474, kg, assay, ton, abbreviation, at, is, not, a, unit, of, measurement, but, a, standard, quantity, used, in, assaying, ores, of, precious, metals, a, short, assay, ton, is, approximately, 29, 17, g, 1, 029, oz, and, a, long, assay, ton, is, approximately, 32, 67, g, 1, 152, oz, these, amounts, bear, the, same, ratio, to, a, milligram, as, a, short, or, long, ton, bears, to, a, troy, ounce, therefore, the, number, of, milligrams, of, a, particular, metal, found, in, a, sample, weighing, one, assay, ton, gives, the, number, of, troy, ounces, of, metal, contained, in, a, ton, of, ore, in, documents, that, predate, 1960, the, word, ton, is, sometimes, spelled, tonne, but, in, more, recent, documents, tonne, refers, exclusively, to, the, metric, ton, in, nuclear, power, plants, thm, and, mthm, mean, tonnes, of, heavy, metals, and, mtu, means, tonnes, of, uranium, in, the, steel, industry, the, abbreviation, thm, means, tons, tonnes, hot, metal, which, refers, to, the, amount, of, liquid, iron, or, steel, that, is, produced, particularly, in, the, context, of, blast, furnace, production, or, specific, consumption, a, dry, ton, or, dry, tonne, has, the, same, mass, value, but, the, material, sludge, slurries, compost, and, similar, mixtures, in, which, solid, material, is, soaked, with, or, suspended, in, water, has, been, dried, to, a, relatively, low, consistent, moisture, level, dry, weight, if, the, material, is, in, its, natural, wet, state, it, is, called, a, wet, ton, or, wet, tonne, both, the, uk, definition, of, long, ton, and, us, definition, of, short, ton, have, similar, underlying, bases, each, is, equivalent, to, 20, hundredweight, however, they, are, long, 51, kilograms, 112, lb, or, short, hundredweight, 45, kilograms, 100, lb, respectively, before, the, 20th, century, there, were, several, definitions, prior, to, the, 15th, century, in, england, the, ton, was, 20, hundredweight, each, of, 108, lb, giving, a, ton, of, 2, 160, pounds, 980, kg, in, the, 19th, century, in, different, parts, of, britain, definitions, of, 2, 240, or, 2, 352, or, 2, 400, lb, were, used, with, 2, 000, lb, for, explosives, the, legal, ton, was, usually, 2, 240, lb, in, the, united, kingdom, canada, australia, and, other, areas, that, had, used, the, imperial, system, the, tonne, is, the, form, of, ton, legal, in, trade, the, displacement, essentially, the, weight, of, a, ship, is, traditionally, expressed, in, long, tons, to, simplify, measurement, it, is, determined, by, measuring, the, volume, rather, than, weight, of, water, displaced, and, calculating, the, weight, from, the, volume, and, density, for, practical, purposes, the, displacement, ton, dt, is, a, unit, of, volume, 35, cubic, feet, 0, 9911, m, 3, the, approximate, volume, occupied, by, one, ton, of, seawater, the, actual, volume, varies, with, salinity, and, temperature, it, is, slightly, less, than, the, 224, imperial, gallons, 1, 018, m, 3, of, the, water, ton, based, on, distilled, water, one, measurement, ton, or, freight, ton, is, equal, to, 40, cubic, feet, 1, 133, m, 3, but, historically, it, has, had, several, different, definitions, it, is, used, to, determine, the, amount, of, money, to, be, charged, in, loading, unloading, or, carrying, different, sorts, of, cargo, in, general, if, a, cargo, is, heavier, than, salt, water, the, actual, weight, is, used, if, it, is, lighter, than, salt, water, e, g, feathers, freight, is, calculated, in, measurement, tons, of, 40, cubic, feet, gross, tonnage, and, net, tonnage, are, volumetric, measures, of, the, cargo, carrying, capacity, of, a, ship, the, panama, canal, universal, measurement, system, pc, ums, is, based, on, net, tonnage, modified, for, panama, canal, billing, purposes, pc, ums, is, based, on, a, mathematical, formula, to, calculate, a, vessel, s, total, volume, a, pc, ums, net, ton, is, equivalent, to, 100, cubic, feet, of, capacity, the, water, ton, is, used, chiefly, in, great, britain, in, statistics, dealing, with, petroleum, products, and, is, defined, as, 224, imperial, gallons, 35, 96, cu, ft, 1, 018, m, 3, the, volume, occupied, by, 1, long, ton, 2, 240, lb, 1, 016, kg, of, water, under, the, conditions, that, define, the, imperial, gallon, these, are, small, calories, cal, the, large, or, dietary, calorie, cal, is, equal, to, one, kilocalorie, kcal, and, is, gradually, being, replaced, by, the, latter, correct, term, early, values, for, the, explosive, energy, released, by, trinitrotoluene, tnt, ranged, from, 900, to, 1100, calories, per, gram, in, order, to, standardise, the, use, of, the, term, tnt, as, a, unit, of, energy, an, arbitrary, value, was, assigned, based, on, 1, 000, calories, 1, kcal, or, 4, 184, kj, per, gram, thus, there, is, no, longer, a, direct, connection, to, the, chemical, tnt, itself, it, is, now, merely, a, unit, of, energy, that, happens, to, be, expressed, using, words, normally, associated, with, mass, e, g, kilogram, tonne, pound, the, definition, applies, for, both, spellings, ton, of, tnt, and, tonne, of, tnt, measurements, in, tons, of, tnt, have, been, used, primarily, to, express, nuclear, weapon, yields, though, they, have, also, been, used, since, in, seismology, as, well, a, tonne, of, oil, equivalent, toe, sometimes, ton, of, oil, equivalent, is, a, conventional, value, based, on, the, amount, of, energy, released, by, burning, one, tonne, of, crude, oil, the, unit, is, used, for, example, by, the, international, energy, agency, iea, for, the, reported, world, energy, consumption, as, tpes, in, millions, of, toe, mtoe, other, sources, convert, 1, toe, into, 1, 28, tonne, of, coal, equivalent, tce, 1, toe, is, also, standardized, as, 7, 33, barrel, of, oil, equivalent, boe, a, tonne, of, coal, equivalent, tce, sometimes, ton, of, coal, equivalent, is, a, conventional, value, based, on, the, amount, of, energy, released, by, burning, one, tonne, of, coal, plural, name, is, tonnes, of, coal, equivalent, the, unit, ton, is, used, in, refrigeration, and, air, conditioning, to, measure, the, rate, of, heat, absorption, prior, to, the, introduction, of, mechanical, refrigeration, cooling, was, accomplished, by, delivering, ice, installing, one, ton, of, mechanical, refrigeration, capacity, replaced, the, daily, delivery, of, one, ton, of, ice, the, refrigeration, ton, is, commonly, abbreviated, as, rt
