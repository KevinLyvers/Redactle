procyon, p, r, o, s, i, n, is, the, brightest, star, in, the, constellation, of, canis, minor, and, usually, the, eighth, brightest, star, in, the, night, sky, with, an, apparent, visual, magnitude, of, 0, 34, it, has, the, bayer, designation, canis, minoris, which, is, latinized, to, alpha, canis, minoris, and, abbreviated, cmi, or, alpha, cmi, respectively, as, determined, by, the, european, space, agency, hipparcos, astrometry, satellite, this, system, lies, at, a, distance, of, just, 11, 46, light, years, 3, 51, parsecs, and, is, therefore, one, of, earth, s, nearest, stellar, neighbors, a, binary, star, system, procyon, consists, of, a, white, hued, main, sequence, star, of, spectral, type, f5, iv, v, designated, component, a, in, orbit, with, a, faint, white, dwarf, companion, of, spectral, type, dqz, named, procyon, b, the, pair, orbit, each, other, with, a, period, of, 40, 84, years, and, an, eccentricity, of, 0, 4, procyon, is, usually, the, eighth, brightest, star, in, the, night, sky, culminating, at, midnight, on, 14, january, it, forms, one, of, the, three, vertices, of, the, winter, triangle, asterism, in, combination, with, sirius, and, betelgeuse, the, prime, period, for, evening, viewing, of, procyon, is, in, late, winter, in, the, northern, hemisphere, it, has, a, color, index, of, 0, 42, and, its, hue, has, been, described, as, having, a, faint, yellow, tinge, to, it, procyon, is, a, binary, star, system, with, a, bright, primary, component, procyon, a, having, an, apparent, magnitude, of, 0, 34, and, a, faint, companion, procyon, b, at, magnitude, 10, 7, the, pair, orbit, each, other, with, a, period, of, 40, 84, years, along, an, elliptical, orbit, with, an, eccentricity, of, 0, 4, more, eccentric, than, mercury, s, the, plane, of, their, orbit, is, inclined, at, an, angle, of, 31, 1, to, the, line, of, sight, with, the, earth, the, average, separation, of, the, two, components, is, 15, 0, au, a, little, less, than, the, distance, between, uranus, and, the, sun, though, the, eccentric, orbit, carries, them, as, close, as, 8, 9, au, and, as, far, as, 21, 0, au, the, primary, has, a, stellar, classification, of, f5iv, v, indicating, that, it, is, a, late, stage, f, type, main, sequence, star, procyon, a, is, bright, for, its, spectral, class, suggesting, that, it, is, evolving, into, a, subgiant, that, has, nearly, fused, its, hydrogen, core, into, helium, after, which, it, will, expand, as, the, nuclear, reactions, move, outside, the, core, as, it, continues, to, expand, the, star, will, eventually, swell, to, about, 80, to, 150, times, its, current, diameter, and, become, a, red, or, orange, color, this, will, probably, happen, within, 10, to, 100, million, years, the, effective, temperature, of, the, stellar, atmosphere, is, an, estimated, 6, 530, k, giving, procyon, a, a, white, hue, it, is, 1, 5, times, the, solar, mass, m, twice, the, solar, radius, r, and, has, seven, times, the, sun, s, luminosity, l, both, the, core, and, the, envelope, of, this, star, are, convective, the, two, regions, being, separated, by, a, wide, radiation, zone, in, late, june, 2004, canada, s, orbital, most, satellite, telescope, carried, out, a, 32, day, survey, of, procyon, a, the, continuous, optical, monitoring, was, intended, to, confirm, solar, like, oscillations, in, its, brightness, observed, from, earth, and, to, permit, asteroseismology, no, oscillations, were, detected, and, the, authors, concluded, that, the, theory, of, stellar, oscillations, may, need, to, be, reconsidered, however, others, argued, that, the, non, detection, was, consistent, with, published, ground, based, radial, velocity, observations, of, solar, like, oscillations, subsequent, observations, in, radial, velocity, have, confirmed, that, procyon, is, indeed, oscillating, photometric, measurements, from, the, nasa, wide, field, infrared, explorer, wire, satellite, from, 1999, and, 2000, showed, evidence, of, granulation, convection, near, the, surface, of, the, star, and, solar, like, oscillations, unlike, the, most, result, the, variation, seen, in, the, wire, photometry, was, in, agreement, with, radial, velocity, measurements, from, the, ground, additional, observations, with, most, taken, in, 2007, were, able, to, detect, oscillations, like, sirius, b, procyon, b, is, a, white, dwarf, that, was, inferred, from, astrometric, data, long, before, it, was, observed, its, existence, had, been, postulated, by, german, astronomer, friedrich, bessel, as, early, as, 1844, and, although, its, orbital, elements, had, been, calculated, by, his, countryman, arthur, auwers, in, 1862, as, part, of, his, thesis, procyon, b, was, not, visually, confirmed, until, 1896, when, john, martin, schaeberle, observed, it, at, the, predicted, position, using, the, 36, inch, refractor, at, lick, observatory, it, is, more, difficult, to, observe, from, earth, than, sirius, b, due, to, a, greater, apparent, magnitude, difference, and, smaller, angular, separation, from, its, primary, at, 0, 6, m, procyon, b, is, considerably, less, massive, than, sirius, b, however, the, peculiarities, of, degenerate, matter, ensure, that, it, is, larger, than, its, more, famous, neighbor, with, an, estimated, radius, of, 8, 600, km, versus, 5, 800, km, for, sirius, b, the, radius, agrees, with, white, dwarf, models, that, assume, a, carbon, core, it, has, a, stellar, classification, of, dqz, having, a, helium, dominated, atmosphere, with, traces, of, heavy, elements, for, reasons, that, remain, unclear, the, mass, of, procyon, b, is, unusually, low, for, a, white, dwarf, star, of, its, type, with, a, surface, temperature, of, 7740, k, it, is, also, much, cooler, than, sirius, b, this, is, a, testament, to, its, lesser, mass, and, greater, age, the, mass, of, the, progenitor, star, for, procyon, b, was, about, 2, 59, 0, 22, 0, 18, m, and, it, came, to, the, end, of, its, life, some, 1, 19, 0, 11, billion, years, ago, after, a, main, sequence, lifetime, of, 680, 170, million, years, attempts, to, detect, x, ray, emission, from, procyon, with, nonimaging, soft, x, ray, sensitive, detectors, prior, to, 1975, failed, extensive, observations, of, procyon, were, carried, out, with, the, copernicus, and, td, 1a, satellites, in, the, late, 1970s, the, x, ray, source, associated, with, procyon, ab, was, observed, on, 1, april, 1979, with, the, einstein, observatory, high, resolution, imager, hri, the, hri, x, ray, pointlike, source, location, is, 4, south, of, procyon, a, on, the, edge, of, the, 90, confidence, error, circle, indicating, identification, with, procyon, a, rather, than, procyon, b, which, was, located, about, 5, north, of, procyon, a, about, 9, from, the, x, ray, source, location, canis, minoris, latinized, to, alpha, canis, minoris, is, the, star, s, bayer, designation, the, name, procyon, comes, from, the, ancient, greek, prokyon, meaning, before, the, dog, since, it, precedes, the, dog, star, sirius, as, it, travels, across, the, sky, due, to, earth, s, rotation, although, procyon, has, a, greater, right, ascension, it, also, has, a, more, northerly, declination, which, means, it, will, rise, above, the, horizon, earlier, than, sirius, from, most, northerly, latitudes, in, greek, mythology, procyon, is, associated, with, maera, a, hound, belonging, to, erigone, daughter, of, icarius, of, athens, in, 2016, the, international, astronomical, union, organized, a, working, group, on, star, names, wgsn, to, catalog, and, standardize, proper, names, for, stars, the, wgsn, s, first, bulletin, of, july, 2016, included, a, table, of, the, first, two, batches, of, names, approved, by, the, wgsn, which, included, procyon, for, the, star, canis, minoris, a, the, two, dog, stars, are, referred, to, in, the, most, ancient, literature, and, were, venerated, by, the, babylonians, and, the, egyptians, in, babylonian, mythology, procyon, was, known, as, nangar, the, carpenter, an, aspect, of, marduk, involved, in, constructing, and, organizing, the, celestial, sky, the, constellations, in, macedonian, folklore, represented, agricultural, items, and, animals, reflecting, their, village, way, of, life, to, them, procyon, and, sirius, were, volci, the, wolves, circling, hungrily, around, orion, which, depicted, a, plough, with, oxen, rarer, names, are, the, latin, translation, of, procyon, antecanis, and, the, arabic, derived, names, al, shira, and, elgomaisa, medieval, astrolabes, of, england, and, western, europe, used, a, variant, of, this, algomeiza, algomeyza, al, shira, derives, from, a, i, ra, a, amiyah, the, syrian, sign, the, other, sign, being, sirius, syria, is, supposedly, a, reference, to, its, northern, location, relative, to, sirius, elgomaisa, derives, from, al, ghumaisa, the, bleary, eyed, woman, in, contrast, to, the, teary, eyed, woman, which, is, sirius, see, gomeisa, in, chinese, n, n, h, meaning, south, river, refers, to, an, asterism, consisting, of, procyon, canis, minoris, and, canis, minoris, consequently, procyon, itself, is, known, as, n, n, h, s, n, the, third, star, of, south, river, it, is, part, of, the, vermilion, bird, the, hawaiians, see, procyon, as, part, of, an, asterism, ke, ka, o, makali, i, the, canoe, bailer, of, makali, i, that, helps, them, navigate, at, sea, in, hawaiian, language, this, star, is, called, puana, blossom, which, is, a, new, hawaiian, name, based, on, the, m, ori, name, puangahori, it, forms, this, asterism, ke, ka, o, makali, i, with, the, pleiades, makali, i, auriga, orion, capella, sirius, castor, and, pollux, in, tahitian, lore, procyon, was, one, of, the, pillars, propping, up, the, sky, known, as, an, tahu, a, vahine, o, toa, te, manava, star, the, priestess, of, brave, heart, the, pillar, for, elocution, m, ori, astronomers, know, the, star, as, puangahori, false, puanga, which, distinguishes, it, from, its, pair, puanga, or, puanga, rua, blossom, cluster, which, refers, to, a, star, of, great, importance, to, m, ori, culture, and, calendar, known, by, its, western, name, rigel, procyon, appears, on, the, flag, of, brazil, symbolizing, the, state, of, amazonas, the, kalapalo, people, of, mato, grosso, state, in, brazil, call, procyon, and, canopus, kofongo, duck, with, castor, and, pollux, representing, his, hands, the, asterism, s, appearance, signified, the, coming, of, the, rainy, season, and, increase, in, food, staple, manioc, used, at, feasts, to, feed, guests, known, as, sikuliarsiujuittuq, to, the, inuit, procyon, was, quite, significant, in, their, astronomy, and, mythology, its, eponymous, name, means, the, one, who, never, goes, onto, the, newly, formed, sea, ice, and, refers, to, a, man, who, stole, food, from, his, village, s, hunters, because, he, was, too, obese, to, hunt, on, ice, he, was, killed, by, the, other, hunters, who, convinced, him, to, go, on, the, sea, ice, procyon, received, this, designation, because, it, typically, appears, red, though, sometimes, slightly, greenish, as, it, rises, during, the, arctic, winter, this, red, color, was, associated, with, sikuliarsiujuittuq, s, bloody, end, were, the, sun, to, be, observed, from, this, star, system, it, would, appear, to, be, a, magnitude, 2, 55, star, in, the, constellation, aquila, with, the, exact, opposite, coordinates, at, right, ascension, 19, h, 39, m, 18, 11950, s, declination, 05, 13, 29, 9552, it, would, be, as, bright, as, scorpii, is, in, our, sky, canis, minor, would, obviously, be, missing, its, brightest, star, procyon, s, closest, neighboring, star, is, luyten, s, star, about, 1, 12, light, years, 0, 34, parsecs, away, procyon, would, be, the, brightest, star, in, the, night, sky, of, an, exoplanet, orbiting, luyten, s, star, with, an, apparent, magnitude, of, 4, 68, luyten, s, star, would, also, be, visible, from, procyon, at, an, apparent, magnitude, of, 4, 61, unlike, any, red, dwarfs, from, earth
