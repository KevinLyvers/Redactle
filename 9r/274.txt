the, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, abbreviated, as, h, r, diagram, hr, diagram, or, hrd, is, a, scatter, plot, of, stars, showing, the, relationship, between, the, stars, absolute, magnitudes, or, luminosities, and, their, stellar, classifications, or, effective, temperatures, the, diagram, was, created, independently, in, 1911, by, ejnar, hertzsprung, and, by, henry, norris, russell, in, 1913, and, represented, a, major, step, towards, an, understanding, of, stellar, evolution, in, the, nineteenth, century, large, scale, photographic, spectroscopic, surveys, of, stars, were, performed, at, harvard, college, observatory, producing, spectral, classifications, for, tens, of, thousands, of, stars, culminating, ultimately, in, the, henry, draper, catalogue, in, one, segment, of, this, work, antonia, maury, included, divisions, of, the, stars, by, the, width, of, their, spectral, lines, hertzsprung, noted, that, stars, described, with, narrow, lines, tended, to, have, smaller, proper, motions, than, the, others, of, the, same, spectral, classification, he, took, this, as, an, indication, of, greater, luminosity, for, the, narrow, line, stars, and, computed, secular, parallaxes, for, several, groups, of, these, allowing, him, to, estimate, their, absolute, magnitude, in, 1910, hans, oswald, rosenberg, published, a, diagram, plotting, the, apparent, magnitude, of, stars, in, the, pleiades, cluster, against, the, strengths, of, the, calcium, k, line, and, two, hydrogen, balmer, lines, these, spectral, lines, serve, as, a, proxy, for, the, temperature, of, the, star, an, early, form, of, spectral, classification, the, apparent, magnitude, of, stars, in, the, same, cluster, is, equivalent, to, their, absolute, magnitude, and, so, this, early, diagram, was, effectively, a, plot, of, luminosity, against, temperature, the, same, type, of, diagram, is, still, used, today, as, a, means, of, showing, the, stars, in, clusters, without, having, to, initially, know, their, distance, and, luminosity, hertzsprung, had, already, been, working, with, this, type, of, diagram, but, his, first, publications, showing, it, were, not, until, 1911, this, was, also, the, form, of, the, diagram, using, apparent, magnitudes, of, a, cluster, of, stars, all, at, the, same, distance, russell, s, early, 1913, versions, of, the, diagram, included, maury, s, giant, stars, identified, by, hertzsprung, those, nearby, stars, with, parallaxes, measured, at, the, time, stars, from, the, hyades, a, nearby, open, cluster, and, several, moving, groups, for, which, the, moving, cluster, method, could, be, used, to, derive, distances, and, thereby, obtain, absolute, magnitudes, for, those, stars, there, are, several, forms, of, the, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, and, the, nomenclature, is, not, very, well, defined, all, forms, share, the, same, general, layout, stars, of, greater, luminosity, are, toward, the, top, of, the, diagram, and, stars, with, higher, surface, temperature, are, toward, the, left, side, of, the, diagram, the, original, diagram, displayed, the, spectral, type, of, stars, on, the, horizontal, axis, and, the, absolute, visual, magnitude, on, the, vertical, axis, the, spectral, type, is, not, a, numerical, quantity, but, the, sequence, of, spectral, types, is, a, monotonic, series, that, reflects, the, stellar, surface, temperature, modern, observational, versions, of, the, chart, replace, spectral, type, by, a, color, index, in, diagrams, made, in, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, most, often, the, b, v, color, of, the, stars, this, type, of, diagram, is, what, is, often, called, an, observational, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, or, specifically, a, color, magnitude, diagram, cmd, and, it, is, often, used, by, observers, in, cases, where, the, stars, are, known, to, be, at, identical, distances, such, as, within, a, star, cluster, a, color, magnitude, diagram, is, often, used, to, describe, the, stars, of, the, cluster, with, a, plot, in, which, the, vertical, axis, is, the, apparent, magnitude, of, the, stars, for, cluster, members, by, assumption, there, is, a, single, additive, constant, difference, between, their, apparent, and, absolute, magnitudes, called, the, distance, modulus, for, all, of, that, cluster, of, stars, early, studies, of, nearby, open, clusters, like, the, hyades, and, pleiades, by, hertzsprung, and, rosenberg, produced, the, first, cmds, a, few, years, before, russell, s, influential, synthesis, of, the, diagram, collecting, data, for, all, stars, for, which, absolute, magnitudes, could, be, determined, another, form, of, the, diagram, plots, the, effective, surface, temperature, of, the, star, on, one, axis, and, the, luminosity, of, the, star, on, the, other, almost, invariably, in, a, log, log, plot, theoretical, calculations, of, stellar, structure, and, the, evolution, of, stars, produce, plots, that, match, those, from, observations, this, type, of, diagram, could, be, called, temperature, luminosity, diagram, but, this, term, is, hardly, ever, used, when, the, distinction, is, made, this, form, is, called, the, theoretical, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, instead, a, peculiar, characteristic, of, this, form, of, the, h, r, diagram, is, that, the, temperatures, are, plotted, from, high, temperature, to, low, temperature, which, aids, in, comparing, this, form, of, the, h, r, diagram, with, the, observational, form, although, the, two, types, of, diagrams, are, similar, astronomers, make, a, sharp, distinction, between, the, two, the, reason, for, this, distinction, is, that, the, exact, transformation, from, one, to, the, other, is, not, trivial, to, go, between, effective, temperature, and, color, requires, a, color, temperature, relation, and, constructing, that, is, difficult, it, is, known, to, be, a, function, of, stellar, composition, and, can, be, affected, by, other, factors, like, stellar, rotation, when, converting, luminosity, or, absolute, bolometric, magnitude, to, apparent, or, absolute, visual, magnitude, one, requires, a, bolometric, correction, which, may, or, may, not, come, from, the, same, source, as, the, color, temperature, relation, one, also, needs, to, know, the, distance, to, the, observed, objects, i, e, the, distance, modulus, and, the, effects, of, interstellar, obscuration, both, in, the, color, reddening, and, in, the, apparent, magnitude, where, the, effect, is, called, extinction, color, distortion, including, reddening, and, extinction, obscuration, are, also, apparent, in, stars, having, significant, circumstellar, dust, the, ideal, of, direct, comparison, of, theoretical, predictions, of, stellar, evolution, to, observations, thus, has, additional, uncertainties, incurred, in, the, conversions, between, theoretical, quantities, and, observations, most, of, the, stars, occupy, the, region, in, the, diagram, along, the, line, called, the, main, sequence, during, the, stage, of, their, lives, in, which, stars, are, found, on, the, main, sequence, line, they, are, fusing, hydrogen, in, their, cores, the, next, concentration, of, stars, is, on, the, horizontal, branch, helium, fusion, in, the, core, and, hydrogen, burning, in, a, shell, surrounding, the, core, another, prominent, feature, is, the, hertzsprung, gap, located, in, the, region, between, a5, and, g0, spectral, type, and, between, 1, and, 3, absolute, magnitudes, i, e, between, the, top, of, the, main, sequence, and, the, giants, in, the, horizontal, branch, rr, lyrae, variable, stars, can, be, found, in, the, left, of, this, gap, on, a, section, of, the, diagram, called, the, instability, strip, cepheid, variables, also, fall, on, the, instability, strip, at, higher, luminosities, the, h, r, diagram, can, be, used, by, scientists, to, roughly, measure, how, far, away, a, star, cluster, or, galaxy, is, from, earth, this, can, be, done, by, comparing, the, apparent, magnitudes, of, the, stars, in, the, cluster, to, the, absolute, magnitudes, of, stars, with, known, distances, or, of, model, stars, the, observed, group, is, then, shifted, in, the, vertical, direction, until, the, two, main, sequences, overlap, the, difference, in, magnitude, that, was, bridged, in, order, to, match, the, two, groups, is, called, the, distance, modulus, and, is, a, direct, measure, for, the, distance, ignoring, extinction, this, technique, is, known, as, main, sequence, fitting, and, is, a, type, of, spectroscopic, parallax, not, only, the, turn, off, in, the, main, sequence, can, be, used, but, also, the, tip, of, the, red, giant, branch, stars, esa, s, gaia, mission, showed, several, features, in, the, diagram, that, were, either, not, known, or, that, were, suspected, to, exist, it, found, a, gap, in, the, main, sequence, that, appears, for, m, dwarfs, and, that, is, explained, with, the, transition, from, a, partly, convective, core, to, a, fully, convective, core, for, white, dwarfs, the, diagram, shows, several, features, two, main, concentrations, appear, in, this, diagram, following, the, cooling, sequence, of, white, dwarfs, that, are, explained, with, the, atmospheric, composition, of, white, dwarfs, especially, hydrogen, versus, helium, dominated, atmospheres, of, white, dwarfs, a, third, concentration, is, explained, with, core, crystallization, of, the, white, dwarfs, interior, this, releases, energy, and, delays, the, cooling, of, white, dwarfs, contemplation, of, the, diagram, led, astronomers, to, speculate, that, it, might, demonstrate, stellar, evolution, the, main, suggestion, being, that, stars, collapsed, from, red, giants, to, dwarf, stars, then, moving, down, along, the, line, of, the, main, sequence, in, the, course, of, their, lifetimes, stars, were, thought, therefore, to, radiate, energy, by, converting, gravitational, energy, into, radiation, through, the, kelvin, helmholtz, mechanism, this, mechanism, resulted, in, an, age, for, the, sun, of, only, tens, of, millions, of, years, creating, a, conflict, over, the, age, of, the, solar, system, between, astronomers, and, biologists, and, geologists, who, had, evidence, that, the, earth, was, far, older, than, that, this, conflict, was, only, resolved, in, the, 1930s, when, nuclear, fusion, was, identified, as, the, source, of, stellar, energy, following, russell, s, presentation, of, the, diagram, to, a, meeting, of, the, royal, astronomical, society, in, 1912, arthur, eddington, was, inspired, to, use, it, as, a, basis, for, developing, ideas, on, stellar, physics, in, 1926, in, his, book, the, internal, constitution, of, the, stars, he, explained, the, physics, of, how, stars, fit, on, the, diagram, the, paper, anticipated, the, later, discovery, of, nuclear, fusion, and, correctly, proposed, that, the, star, s, source, of, power, was, the, combination, of, hydrogen, into, helium, liberating, enormous, energy, this, was, a, particularly, remarkable, intuitive, leap, since, at, that, time, the, source, of, a, star, s, energy, was, still, unknown, thermonuclear, energy, had, not, been, proven, to, exist, and, even, that, stars, are, largely, composed, of, hydrogen, see, metallicity, had, not, yet, been, discovered, eddington, managed, to, sidestep, this, problem, by, concentrating, on, the, thermodynamics, of, radiative, transport, of, energy, in, stellar, interiors, eddington, predicted, that, dwarf, stars, remain, in, an, essentially, static, position, on, the, main, sequence, for, most, of, their, lives, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, with, an, understanding, of, hydrogen, fusion, came, an, evidence, backed, theory, of, evolution, to, red, giants, following, which, were, speculated, cases, of, explosion, and, implosion, of, the, remnants, to, white, dwarfs, the, term, supernova, nucleosynthesis, is, used, to, describe, the, creation, of, elements, during, the, evolution, and, explosion, of, a, pre, supernova, star, a, concept, put, forth, by, fred, hoyle, in, 1954, the, pure, mathematical, quantum, mechanics, and, classical, mechanical, models, of, stellar, processes, enable, the, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, to, be, annotated, with, known, conventional, paths, known, as, stellar, sequences, there, continue, to, be, added, rarer, and, more, anomalous, examples, as, more, stars, are, analysed, and, mathematical, models, considered
