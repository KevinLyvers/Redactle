onia, a, cloud, chamber, also, known, as, a, wilson, cloud, chamber, is, a, particle, detector, used, for, visualizing, the, passage, of, ionizing, radiation, a, cloud, chamber, consists, of, a, sealed, environment, containing, a, supersaturated, vapor, of, water, or, alcohol, an, energetic, charged, particle, for, example, an, alpha, or, beta, particle, interacts, with, the, gaseous, mixture, by, knocking, electrons, off, gas, molecules, via, electrostatic, forces, during, collisions, resulting, in, a, trail, of, ionized, gas, particles, the, resulting, ions, act, as, condensation, centers, around, which, a, mist, like, trail, of, small, droplets, form, if, the, gas, mixture, is, at, the, point, of, condensation, these, droplets, are, visible, as, a, cloud, track, that, persists, for, several, seconds, while, the, droplets, fall, through, the, vapor, these, tracks, have, characteristic, shapes, for, example, an, alpha, particle, track, is, thick, and, straight, while, a, beta, particle, track, is, wispy, and, shows, more, evidence, of, deflections, by, collisions, cloud, chambers, were, invented, in, the, early, 1900s, by, the, scottish, physicist, charles, thomson, rees, wilson, they, played, a, prominent, role, in, experimental, particle, physics, from, the, 1920s, to, the, 1950s, until, the, advent, of, the, bubble, chamber, in, particular, the, discoveries, of, the, positron, in, 1932, see, fig, 1, and, the, muon, in, 1936, both, by, carl, anderson, awarded, a, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 1936, used, cloud, chambers, the, discovery, of, the, kaon, by, george, rochester, and, clifford, charles, butler, in, 1947, was, made, using, a, cloud, chamber, as, the, detector, in, each, of, these, cases, cosmic, rays, were, the, source, of, ionizing, radiation, yet, they, were, also, used, with, artificial, sources, of, particles, for, example, in, radiography, applications, as, part, of, the, manhattan, project, charles, thomson, rees, wilson, 1869, 1959, a, scottish, physicist, is, credited, with, inventing, the, cloud, chamber, inspired, by, sightings, of, the, brocken, spectre, while, working, on, the, summit, of, ben, nevis, in, 1894, he, began, to, develop, expansion, chambers, for, studying, cloud, formation, and, optical, phenomena, in, moist, air, very, rapidly, he, discovered, that, ions, could, act, as, centers, for, water, droplet, formation, in, such, chambers, he, pursued, the, application, of, this, discovery, and, perfected, the, first, cloud, chamber, in, 1911, in, wilson, s, original, chamber, see, fig, 2, the, air, inside, the, sealed, device, was, saturated, with, water, vapor, then, a, diaphragm, was, used, to, expand, the, air, inside, the, chamber, adiabatic, expansion, cooling, the, air, and, starting, to, condense, water, vapor, hence, the, name, expansion, cloud, chamber, is, used, when, an, ionizing, particle, passes, through, the, chamber, water, vapor, condenses, on, the, resulting, ions, and, the, trail, of, the, particle, is, visible, in, the, vapor, cloud, a, cine, film, was, used, to, record, the, images, further, developments, were, made, by, patrick, blackett, who, utilised, a, stiff, spring, to, expand, and, compress, the, chamber, very, rapidly, making, the, chamber, sensitive, to, particles, several, times, a, second, this, kind, of, chamber, is, also, called, a, pulsed, chamber, because, the, conditions, for, operation, are, not, continuously, maintained, wilson, received, half, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 1927, for, his, work, on, the, cloud, chamber, the, same, year, as, arthur, compton, received, half, the, prize, for, the, compton, effect, the, diffusion, cloud, chamber, was, developed, in, 1936, by, alexander, langsdorf, this, chamber, differs, from, the, expansion, cloud, chamber, in, that, it, is, continuously, sensitized, to, radiation, and, in, that, the, bottom, must, be, cooled, to, a, rather, low, temperature, generally, colder, than, 26, c, 15, f, instead, of, water, vapor, alcohol, is, used, because, of, its, lower, freezing, point, cloud, chambers, cooled, by, dry, ice, or, peltier, effect, thermoelectric, cooling, are, common, demonstration, and, hobbyist, devices, the, alcohol, used, in, them, is, commonly, isopropyl, alcohol, or, methylated, spirit, diffusion, type, cloud, chambers, will, be, discussed, here, a, simple, cloud, chamber, consists, of, the, sealed, environment, a, warm, top, plate, and, a, cold, bottom, plate, see, fig, 3, it, requires, a, source, of, liquid, alcohol, at, the, warm, side, of, the, chamber, where, the, liquid, evaporates, forming, a, vapor, that, cools, as, it, falls, through, the, gas, and, condenses, on, the, cold, bottom, plate, some, sort, of, ionizing, radiation, is, needed, isopropanol, methanol, or, other, alcohol, vapor, saturates, the, chamber, the, alcohol, falls, as, it, cools, down, and, the, cold, condenser, provides, a, steep, temperature, gradient, the, result, is, a, supersaturated, environment, as, energetic, charged, particles, pass, through, the, gas, they, leave, ionization, trails, the, alcohol, vapor, condenses, around, gaseous, ion, trails, left, behind, by, the, ionizing, particles, this, occurs, because, alcohol, and, water, molecules, are, polar, resulting, in, a, net, attractive, force, toward, a, nearby, free, charge, see, fig, 4, the, result, is, a, misty, cloud, like, formation, seen, by, the, presence, of, droplets, falling, down, to, the, condenser, when, the, tracks, are, emitted, from, a, source, their, point, of, origin, can, easily, be, determined, fig, 5, shows, an, example, of, an, alpha, particle, from, a, pb, 210, pin, type, source, undergoing, rutherford, scattering, just, above, the, cold, condenser, plate, there, is, a, volume, of, the, chamber, which, is, sensitive, to, ionization, tracks, the, ion, trail, left, by, the, radioactive, particles, provides, an, optimal, trigger, for, condensation, and, cloud, formation, this, sensitive, volume, is, increased, in, height, by, employing, a, steep, temperature, gradient, and, stable, conditions, a, strong, electric, field, is, often, used, to, draw, cloud, tracks, down, to, the, sensitive, region, of, the, chamber, and, increase, the, sensitivity, of, the, chamber, the, electric, field, can, also, serve, to, prevent, large, amounts, of, background, rain, from, obscuring, the, sensitive, region, of, the, chamber, caused, by, condensation, forming, above, the, sensitive, volume, of, the, chamber, thereby, obscuring, tracks, by, constant, precipitation, a, black, background, makes, it, easier, to, observe, cloud, tracks, and, typically, a, tangential, light, source, is, needed, to, illuminate, the, white, droplets, against, the, black, background, often, the, tracks, are, not, apparent, until, a, shallow, pool, of, alcohol, is, formed, at, the, condenser, plate, if, a, magnetic, field, is, applied, across, the, cloud, chamber, positively, and, negatively, charged, particles, will, curve, in, opposite, directions, according, to, the, lorentz, force, law, strong, enough, fields, are, difficult, to, achieve, however, with, small, hobbyist, setups, this, method, was, also, used, to, prove, the, existence, of, the, positron, in, 1932, in, accordance, with, paul, dirac, s, theoretical, proof, published, in, 1928, the, bubble, chamber, was, invented, by, donald, a, glaser, of, the, united, states, in, 1952, and, for, this, he, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 1960, the, bubble, chamber, similarly, reveals, the, tracks, of, subatomic, particles, but, as, trails, of, bubbles, in, a, superheated, liquid, usually, liquid, hydrogen, bubble, chambers, can, be, made, physically, larger, than, cloud, chambers, and, since, they, are, filled, with, much, denser, liquid, material, they, reveal, the, tracks, of, much, more, energetic, particles, these, factors, rapidly, made, the, bubble, chamber, the, predominant, particle, detector, for, a, number, of, decades, so, that, cloud, chambers, were, effectively, superseded, in, fundamental, research, by, the, start, of, the, 1960s, a, spark, chamber, is, an, electrical, device, that, uses, a, grid, of, uninsulated, electric, wires, in, a, chamber, with, high, voltages, applied, between, the, wires, energetic, charged, particles, cause, ionization, of, the, gas, along, the, path, of, the, particle, in, the, same, way, as, in, the, wilson, cloud, chamber, but, in, this, case, the, ambient, electric, fields, are, high, enough, to, precipitate, full, scale, gas, breakdown, in, the, form, of, sparks, at, the, position, of, the, initial, ionization, the, presence, and, location, of, these, sparks, is, then, registered, electrically, and, the, information, is, stored, for, later, analysis, such, as, by, a, digital, computer, similar, condensation, effects, can, be, observed, as, wilson, clouds, also, called, condensation, clouds, at, large, explosions, in, humid, air, and, other, prandtl, glauert, singularity, effects
