butane, b, ju, t, e, n, or, n, butane, is, an, alkane, with, the, formula, c, 4, h, 10, butane, is, a, highly, flammable, colorless, easily, liquefied, gas, that, quickly, vaporizes, at, room, temperature, and, pressure, the, name, butane, comes, from, the, root, but, from, butyric, acid, named, after, the, greek, word, for, butter, and, the, suffix, ane, it, was, discovered, in, crude, petroleum, in, 1864, by, edmund, ronalds, who, was, the, first, to, describe, its, properties, and, commercialized, by, walter, o, snelling, in, the, early, 1910s, butane, is, one, of, a, group, of, liquefied, petroleum, gases, lp, gases, the, others, include, propane, propylene, butadiene, butylene, isobutylene, and, mixtures, thereof, butane, burns, more, cleanly, than, both, gasoline, and, coal, the, first, synthesis, of, butane, was, accidentally, achieved, by, british, chemist, edward, frankland, in, 1849, from, ethyl, iodide, and, zinc, but, he, had, not, realized, that, the, ethyl, radical, dimerized, and, misidentified, the, substance, edmund, ronalds, was, the, first, individual, to, isolate, and, describe, butane, which, he, named, hydride, of, butyl, based, on, the, naming, for, the, then, known, butyric, acid, which, had, been, named, and, described, by, the, french, chemist, michel, eug, ne, chevreul, 40, years, earlier, other, names, arose, in, the, 1860s, butyl, hydride, hydride, of, tetryl, and, tetryl, hydride, diethyl, or, ethyl, ethylide, and, others, august, wilhelm, von, hofmann, in, his, 1866, systemic, nomenclature, proposed, the, name, quartane, and, the, modern, name, was, introduced, to, english, from, german, around, 1874, butane, did, not, have, much, practical, use, until, the, 1910s, when, w, snelling, identified, butane, and, propane, as, components, in, gasoline, and, found, that, if, they, were, cooled, they, could, be, stored, in, a, volume, reduced, liquified, state, in, pressurized, containers, in, 1911, snelling, s, liquified, petroleum, gas, was, publicly, available, and, his, process, for, producing, the, mixture, was, patented, in, 1913, butane, is, one, of, the, most, produced, industrial, chemicals, in, the, 21st, century, with, around, 80, 90, billion, lbs, 40, million, us, tons, 36, million, metric, tons, produced, by, the, united, states, every, year, the, density, of, butane, is, highly, dependent, on, temperature, and, pressure, in, the, reservoir, for, example, the, density, of, liquid, butane, is, 571, 8, 1, kg, m, 3, for, pressures, up, to, 2mpa, and, temperature, 27, 0, 2, c, while, the, density, of, liquid, butane, is, 625, 5, 0, 7, kg, m, 3, for, pressures, up, to, 2mpa, and, temperature, 13, 0, 2, c, rotation, about, the, central, c, c, bond, produces, two, different, conformations, trans, and, gauche, for, n, butane, when, oxygen, is, plentiful, butane, burns, to, form, carbon, dioxide, and, water, vapor, when, oxygen, is, limited, carbon, soot, or, carbon, monoxide, may, also, be, formed, butane, is, denser, than, air, when, there, is, sufficient, oxygen, when, oxygen, is, limited, by, weight, butane, contains, about, 49, 5, mj, kg, 13, 8, kwh, kg, 22, 5, mj, lb, 21, 300, btu, lb, or, by, liquid, volume, 29, 7, megajoules, per, liter, 8, 3, kwh, l, 112, mj, u, s, gal, 107, 000, btu, u, s, gal, the, maximum, adiabatic, flame, temperature, of, butane, with, air, is, 2, 243, k, 1, 970, c, 3, 578, f, n, butane, is, the, feedstock, for, dupont, s, catalytic, process, for, the, preparation, of, maleic, anhydride, n, butane, like, all, hydrocarbons, undergoes, free, radical, chlorination, providing, both, 1, chloro, and, 2, chlorobutanes, as, well, as, more, highly, chlorinated, derivatives, the, relative, rates, of, the, chlorination, is, partially, explained, by, the, differing, bond, dissociation, energies, 425, and, 411, kj, mol, for, the, two, types, of, c, h, bonds, normal, butane, can, be, used, for, gasoline, blending, as, a, fuel, gas, fragrance, extraction, solvent, either, alone, or, in, a, mixture, with, propane, and, as, a, feedstock, for, the, manufacture, of, ethylene, and, butadiene, a, key, ingredient, of, synthetic, rubber, isobutane, is, primarily, used, by, refineries, to, enhance, increase, the, octane, number, of, motor, gasoline, for, gasoline, blending, n, butane, is, the, main, component, used, to, manipulate, the, reid, vapor, pressure, rvp, since, winter, fuels, require, much, higher, vapor, pressure, for, engines, to, start, refineries, raise, the, rvp, by, blending, more, butane, into, the, fuel, n, butane, has, a, relatively, high, research, octane, number, ron, and, motor, octane, number, mon, which, are, 93, and, 92, respectively, when, blended, with, propane, and, other, hydrocarbons, the, mixture, may, be, referred, to, commercially, as, liquefied, petroleum, gas, lpg, it, is, used, as, a, petrol, component, as, a, feedstock, for, the, production, of, base, petrochemicals, in, steam, cracking, as, fuel, for, cigarette, lighters, and, as, a, propellant, in, aerosol, sprays, such, as, deodorants, pure, forms, of, butane, especially, isobutane, are, used, as, refrigerants, and, have, largely, replaced, the, ozone, layer, depleting, halomethanes, in, refrigerators, freezers, and, air, conditioning, systems, the, operating, pressure, for, butane, is, lower, than, for, the, halomethanes, such, as, freon, 12, r, 12, so, r, 12, systems, such, as, those, in, automotive, air, conditioning, systems, when, converted, to, pure, butane, will, function, poorly, a, mixture, of, isobutane, and, propane, is, used, instead, to, give, cooling, system, performance, comparable, to, use, of, r, 12, butane, is, also, used, as, lighter, fuel, for, common, lighters, or, butane, torches, and, is, sold, bottled, as, a, fuel, for, cooking, barbecues, and, camping, stoves, in, the, 20th, century, the, braun, company, of, germany, made, a, cordless, hair, styling, device, product, that, used, butane, as, its, heat, source, to, produce, steam, as, fuel, it, is, often, mixed, with, small, amounts, of, mercaptans, to, give, the, unburned, gas, an, offensive, smell, easily, detected, by, the, human, nose, in, this, way, butane, leaks, can, easily, be, identified, while, hydrogen, sulfide, and, mercaptans, are, toxic, they, are, present, in, levels, so, low, that, suffocation, and, fire, hazard, by, the, butane, becomes, a, concern, far, before, toxicity, most, commercially, available, butane, also, contains, some, contaminant, oil, which, can, be, removed, by, filtration, and, will, otherwise, leave, a, deposit, at, the, point, of, ignition, and, may, eventually, block, the, uniform, flow, of, gas, the, butane, used, as, a, solvent, for, fragrance, extraction, does, not, contain, these, contaminants, and, butane, gas, can, cause, gas, explosions, in, poorly, ventilated, areas, if, leaks, go, unnoticed, and, are, ignited, by, spark, or, flame, purified, butane, is, used, as, a, solvent, in, the, industrial, extraction, of, cannabis, oils, inhalation, of, butane, can, cause, euphoria, drowsiness, unconsciousness, asphyxia, cardiac, arrhythmia, fluctuations, in, blood, pressure, and, temporary, memory, loss, when, abused, directly, from, a, highly, pressurized, container, and, can, result, in, death, from, asphyxiation, and, ventricular, fibrillation, it, enters, the, blood, supply, and, within, seconds, produces, intoxication, butane, is, the, most, commonly, abused, volatile, substance, in, the, uk, and, was, the, cause, of, 52, of, solvent, related, deaths, in, 2000, by, spraying, butane, directly, into, the, throat, the, jet, of, fluid, can, cool, rapidly, to, 20, c, 4, f, by, expansion, causing, prolonged, laryngospasm, sudden, sniffer, s, death, syndrome, first, described, by, bass, in, 1970, is, the, most, common, single, cause, of, solvent, related, death, resulting, in, 55, of, known, fatal, cases
