a, gravity, assist, gravity, assist, maneuver, swing, by, or, generally, a, gravitational, slingshot, in, orbital, mechanics, is, a, type, of, spaceflight, flyby, which, makes, use, of, the, relative, movement, e, g, orbit, around, the, sun, and, gravity, of, a, planet, or, other, astronomical, object, to, alter, the, path, and, speed, of, a, spacecraft, typically, to, save, propellant, and, reduce, expense, gravity, assistance, can, be, used, to, accelerate, a, spacecraft, that, is, to, increase, or, decrease, its, speed, or, redirect, its, path, the, assist, is, provided, by, the, motion, of, the, gravitating, body, as, it, pulls, on, the, spacecraft, any, gain, or, loss, of, kinetic, energy, and, linear, momentum, by, a, passing, spacecraft, is, correspondingly, lost, or, gained, by, the, gravitational, body, in, accordance, with, newton, s, third, law, the, gravity, assist, maneuver, was, first, used, in, 1959, when, the, soviet, probe, luna, 3, photographed, the, far, side, of, earth, s, moon, and, it, was, used, by, interplanetary, probes, from, mariner, 10, onward, including, the, two, voyager, probes, notable, flybys, of, jupiter, and, saturn, a, gravity, assist, around, a, planet, changes, a, spacecraft, s, velocity, relative, to, the, sun, by, entering, and, leaving, the, gravitational, sphere, of, influence, of, a, planet, the, sum, of, the, kinetic, energies, of, both, bodies, remains, constant, see, elastic, collision, a, slingshot, maneuver, can, therefore, be, used, to, change, the, spaceship, s, trajectory, and, speed, relative, to, the, sun, a, close, terrestrial, analogy, is, provided, by, a, tennis, ball, bouncing, off, the, front, of, a, moving, train, imagine, standing, on, a, train, platform, and, throwing, a, ball, at, 30, km, h, toward, a, train, approaching, at, 50, km, h, the, driver, of, the, train, sees, the, ball, approaching, at, 80, km, h, and, then, departing, at, 80, km, h, after, the, ball, bounces, elastically, off, the, front, of, the, train, because, of, the, train, s, motion, however, that, departure, is, at, 130, km, h, relative, to, the, train, platform, the, ball, has, added, twice, the, train, s, velocity, to, its, own, translating, this, analogy, into, space, in, the, planet, reference, frame, the, spaceship, has, a, vertical, velocity, of, v, relative, to, the, planet, after, the, slingshot, occurs, the, spaceship, is, leaving, on, a, course, 90, degrees, to, that, which, it, arrived, on, it, will, still, have, a, velocity, of, v, but, in, the, horizontal, direction, in, the, sun, reference, frame, the, planet, has, a, horizontal, velocity, of, v, and, by, using, the, pythagorean, theorem, the, spaceship, initially, has, a, total, velocity, of, 2, v, after, the, spaceship, leaves, the, planet, it, will, have, a, velocity, of, v, v, 2, v, gaining, approximately, 0, 6, v, this, oversimplified, example, is, impossible, to, refine, without, additional, details, regarding, the, orbit, but, if, the, spaceship, travels, in, a, path, which, forms, a, hyperbola, it, can, leave, the, planet, in, the, opposite, direction, without, firing, its, engine, this, example, is, one, of, many, trajectories, and, gains, of, speed, the, spaceship, can, experience, this, explanation, might, seem, to, violate, the, conservation, of, energy, and, momentum, apparently, adding, velocity, to, the, spacecraft, out, of, nothing, but, the, spacecraft, s, effects, on, the, planet, must, also, be, taken, into, consideration, to, provide, a, complete, picture, of, the, mechanics, involved, the, linear, momentum, gained, by, the, spaceship, is, equal, in, magnitude, to, that, lost, by, the, planet, so, the, spacecraft, gains, velocity, and, the, planet, loses, velocity, however, the, planet, s, enormous, mass, compared, to, the, spacecraft, makes, the, resulting, change, in, its, speed, negligibly, small, even, when, compared, to, the, orbital, perturbations, planets, undergo, due, to, interactions, with, other, celestial, bodies, on, astronomically, short, timescales, for, example, one, metric, ton, is, a, typical, mass, for, an, interplanetary, space, probe, whereas, jupiter, has, a, mass, of, almost, 2, x, 10, 24, metric, tons, therefore, a, one, ton, spacecraft, passing, jupiter, will, theoretically, cause, the, planet, to, lose, approximately, 5, x, 10, 25, km, s, of, orbital, velocity, for, every, km, s, of, velocity, relative, to, the, sun, gained, by, the, spacecraft, for, all, practical, purposes, the, effects, on, the, planet, can, be, ignored, in, the, calculation, realistic, portrayals, of, encounters, in, space, require, the, consideration, of, three, dimensions, the, same, principles, apply, as, above, except, adding, the, planet, s, velocity, to, that, of, the, spacecraft, requires, vector, addition, as, shown, below, due, to, the, reversibility, of, orbits, gravitational, slingshots, can, also, be, used, to, reduce, the, speed, of, a, spacecraft, both, mariner, 10, and, messenger, performed, this, maneuver, to, reach, mercury, if, more, speed, is, needed, than, available, from, gravity, assist, alone, a, rocket, burn, near, the, periapsis, closest, planetary, approach, uses, the, least, fuel, a, given, rocket, burn, always, provides, the, same, change, in, velocity, v, but, the, change, in, kinetic, energy, is, proportional, to, the, vehicle, s, velocity, at, the, time, of, the, burn, therefore, the, maximum, kinetic, energy, is, obtained, when, the, burn, occurs, at, the, vehicle, s, maximum, velocity, periapsis, the, oberth, effect, describes, this, technique, in, more, detail, in, his, paper, to, those, who, will, be, reading, in, order, to, build, published, in, 1938, but, dated, 1918, 1919, yuri, kondratyuk, suggested, that, a, spacecraft, traveling, between, two, planets, could, be, accelerated, at, the, beginning, and, end, of, its, trajectory, by, using, the, gravity, of, the, two, planets, moons, the, portion, of, his, manuscript, considering, gravity, assists, received, no, later, development, and, was, not, published, until, the, 1960s, in, his, 1925, paper, problems, of, flight, by, jet, propulsion, interplanetary, flights, friedrich, zander, showed, a, deep, understanding, of, the, physics, behind, the, concept, of, gravity, assist, and, its, potential, for, the, interplanetary, exploration, of, the, solar, system, italian, engineer, gaetano, crocco, was, first, to, calculate, an, interplanetary, journey, considering, multiple, gravity, assists, the, gravity, assist, maneuver, was, first, used, in, 1959, when, the, soviet, probe, luna, 3, photographed, the, far, side, of, the, moon, the, maneuver, relied, on, research, performed, under, the, direction, of, mstislav, keldysh, at, the, keldysh, institute, of, applied, mathematics, in, 1961, michael, minovitch, ucla, graduate, student, who, worked, at, nasa, s, jet, propulsion, laboratory, jpl, developed, a, gravity, assist, technique, that, would, later, be, used, for, the, gary, flandro, s, planetary, grand, tour, idea, during, the, summer, of, 1964, at, the, nasa, jpl, gary, flandro, was, assigned, the, task, of, studying, techniques, for, exploring, the, outer, planets, of, the, solar, system, in, this, study, he, discovered, the, rare, alignment, of, the, outer, planets, jupiter, saturn, uranus, and, neptune, and, conceived, the, planetary, grand, tour, multi, planet, mission, utilizing, gravity, assist, to, reduce, mission, duration, from, forty, years, to, less, than, ten, a, spacecraft, traveling, from, earth, to, an, inner, planet, will, increase, its, relative, speed, because, it, is, falling, toward, the, sun, and, a, spacecraft, traveling, from, earth, to, an, outer, planet, will, decrease, its, speed, because, it, is, leaving, the, vicinity, of, the, sun, although, the, orbital, speed, of, an, inner, planet, is, greater, than, that, of, the, earth, a, spacecraft, traveling, to, an, inner, planet, even, at, the, minimum, speed, needed, to, reach, it, is, still, accelerated, by, the, sun, s, gravity, to, a, speed, notably, greater, than, the, orbital, speed, of, that, destination, planet, if, the, spacecraft, s, purpose, is, only, to, fly, by, the, inner, planet, then, there, is, typically, no, need, to, slow, the, spacecraft, however, if, the, spacecraft, is, to, be, inserted, into, orbit, about, that, inner, planet, then, there, must, be, some, way, to, slow, it, down, similarly, while, the, orbital, speed, of, an, outer, planet, is, less, than, that, of, the, earth, a, spacecraft, leaving, the, earth, at, the, minimum, speed, needed, to, travel, to, some, outer, planet, is, slowed, by, the, sun, s, gravity, to, a, speed, far, less, than, the, orbital, speed, of, that, outer, planet, therefore, there, must, be, some, way, to, accelerate, the, spacecraft, when, it, reaches, that, outer, planet, if, it, is, to, enter, orbit, about, it, rocket, engines, can, certainly, be, used, to, increase, and, decrease, the, speed, of, the, spacecraft, however, rocket, thrust, takes, propellant, propellant, has, mass, and, even, a, small, change, in, velocity, known, as, v, or, delta, v, the, delta, symbol, being, used, to, represent, a, change, and, v, signifying, velocity, translates, to, a, far, larger, requirement, for, propellant, needed, to, escape, earth, s, gravity, well, this, is, because, not, only, must, the, primary, stage, engines, lift, the, extra, propellant, they, must, also, lift, the, extra, propellant, beyond, that, which, is, needed, to, lift, that, additional, propellant, the, liftoff, mass, requirement, increases, exponentially, with, an, increase, in, the, required, delta, v, of, the, spacecraft, because, additional, fuel, is, needed, to, lift, fuel, into, space, space, missions, are, designed, with, a, tight, propellant, budget, known, as, the, delta, v, budget, the, delta, v, budget, is, in, effect, the, total, propellant, that, will, be, available, after, leaving, the, earth, for, speeding, up, slowing, down, stabilization, against, external, buffeting, by, particles, or, other, external, effects, or, direction, changes, if, it, cannot, acquire, more, propellant, the, entire, mission, must, be, planned, within, that, capability, therefore, methods, of, speed, and, direction, change, that, do, not, require, fuel, to, be, burned, are, advantageous, because, they, allow, extra, maneuvering, capability, and, course, enhancement, without, spending, fuel, from, the, limited, amount, which, has, been, carried, into, space, gravity, assist, maneuvers, can, greatly, change, the, speed, of, a, spacecraft, without, expending, propellant, and, can, save, significant, amounts, of, propellant, so, they, are, a, very, common, technique, to, save, fuel, the, main, practical, limit, to, the, use, of, a, gravity, assist, maneuver, is, that, planets, and, other, large, masses, are, seldom, in, the, right, places, to, enable, a, voyage, to, a, particular, destination, for, example, the, voyager, missions, which, started, in, the, late, 1970s, were, made, possible, by, the, grand, tour, alignment, of, jupiter, saturn, uranus, and, neptune, a, similar, alignment, will, not, occur, again, until, the, middle, of, the, 22nd, century, that, is, an, extreme, case, but, even, for, less, ambitious, missions, there, are, years, when, the, planets, are, scattered, in, unsuitable, parts, of, their, orbits, another, limitation, is, the, atmosphere, if, any, of, the, available, planet, the, closer, the, spacecraft, can, approach, the, faster, its, periapsis, speed, as, gravity, accelerates, the, spacecraft, allowing, for, more, kinetic, energy, to, be, gained, from, a, rocket, burn, however, if, a, spacecraft, gets, too, deep, into, the, atmosphere, the, energy, lost, to, drag, can, exceed, that, gained, from, the, planet, s, gravity, on, the, other, hand, the, atmosphere, can, be, used, to, accomplish, aerobraking, there, have, also, been, theoretical, proposals, to, use, aerodynamic, lift, as, the, spacecraft, flies, through, the, atmosphere, this, maneuver, called, an, aerogravity, assist, could, bend, the, trajectory, through, a, larger, angle, than, gravity, alone, and, hence, increase, the, gain, in, energy, even, in, the, case, of, an, airless, body, there, is, a, limit, to, how, close, a, spacecraft, may, approach, the, magnitude, of, the, achievable, change, in, velocity, depends, on, the, spacecraft, s, approach, velocity, and, the, planet, s, escape, velocity, at, the, point, of, closest, approach, limited, by, either, the, surface, or, the, atmosphere, interplanetary, slingshots, using, the, sun, itself, are, not, possible, because, the, sun, is, at, rest, relative, to, the, solar, system, as, a, whole, however, thrusting, when, near, the, sun, has, the, same, effect, as, the, powered, slingshot, described, as, the, oberth, effect, this, has, the, potential, to, magnify, a, spacecraft, s, thrusting, power, enormously, but, is, limited, by, the, spacecraft, s, ability, to, resist, the, heat, a, rotating, black, hole, might, provide, additional, assistance, if, its, spin, axis, is, aligned, the, right, way, general, relativity, predicts, that, a, large, spinning, mass, produces, frame, dragging, close, to, the, object, space, itself, is, dragged, around, in, the, direction, of, the, spin, any, ordinary, rotating, object, produces, this, effect, although, attempts, to, measure, frame, dragging, about, the, sun, have, produced, no, clear, evidence, experiments, performed, by, gravity, probe, b, have, detected, frame, dragging, effects, caused, by, earth, general, relativity, predicts, that, a, spinning, black, hole, is, surrounded, by, a, region, of, space, called, the, ergosphere, within, which, standing, still, with, respect, to, the, black, hole, s, spin, is, impossible, because, space, itself, is, dragged, at, the, speed, of, light, in, the, same, direction, as, the, black, hole, s, spin, the, penrose, process, may, offer, a, way, to, gain, energy, from, the, ergosphere, although, it, would, require, the, spaceship, to, dump, some, ballast, into, the, black, hole, and, the, spaceship, would, have, had, to, expend, energy, to, carry, the, ballast, to, the, black, hole, the, gravity, assist, maneuver, was, first, attempted, in, 1959, for, luna, 3, to, photograph, the, far, side, of, the, moon, the, satellite, did, not, gain, speed, but, its, orbit, was, changed, that, allowed, successful, transmission, of, the, photos, nasa, s, pioneer, 10, is, a, space, probe, launched, in, 1972, that, completed, the, first, mission, to, the, planet, jupiter, thereafter, pioneer, 10, became, the, first, of, five, artificial, objects, to, achieve, the, escape, velocity, needed, to, leave, the, solar, system, in, december, 1973, pioneer, 10, spacecraft, was, the, first, one, to, use, the, gravitational, slingshot, effect, to, reach, escape, velocity, to, leave, solar, system, pioneer, 11, was, launched, by, nasa, in, 1973, to, study, the, asteroid, belt, the, environment, around, jupiter, and, saturn, solar, winds, and, cosmic, rays, it, was, the, first, probe, to, encounter, saturn, the, second, to, fly, through, the, asteroid, belt, and, the, second, to, fly, by, jupiter, to, get, to, saturn, the, spacecraft, got, a, gravity, assist, on, jupiter, the, mariner, 10, probe, was, the, first, spacecraft, to, use, the, gravitational, slingshot, effect, to, reach, another, planet, passing, by, venus, on, 5, february, 1974, on, its, way, to, becoming, the, first, spacecraft, to, explore, mercury, voyager, 1, was, launched, by, nasa, on, september, 5, 1977, it, gained, the, energy, to, escape, the, sun, s, gravity, by, performing, slingshot, maneuvers, around, jupiter, and, saturn, having, operated, for, 47, years, and, 6, days, as, of, september, 11, 2024, utc, the, spacecraft, still, communicates, with, the, deep, space, network, to, receive, routine, commands, and, to, transmit, data, to, earth, real, time, distance, and, velocity, data, is, provided, by, nasa, and, jpl, at, a, distance, of, 152, 2, au, 22, 8, billion, km, 14, 1, billion, mi, from, earth, as, of, january, 12, 2020, it, is, the, most, distant, human, made, object, from, earth, voyager, 2, was, launched, by, nasa, on, august, 20, 1977, to, study, the, outer, planets, its, trajectory, took, longer, to, reach, jupiter, and, saturn, than, its, twin, spacecraft, but, enabled, further, encounters, with, uranus, and, neptune, the, galileo, spacecraft, was, launched, by, nasa, in, 1989, and, on, its, route, to, jupiter, got, three, gravity, assists, one, from, venus, february, 10, 1990, and, two, from, earth, december, 8, 1990, and, december, 8, 1992, spacecraft, reached, jupiter, in, december, 1995, gravity, assists, also, allowed, galileo, to, flyby, two, asteroids, 243, ida, and, 951, gaspra, in, 1990, nasa, launched, the, esa, spacecraft, ulysses, to, study, the, polar, regions, of, the, sun, all, the, planets, orbit, approximately, in, a, plane, aligned, with, the, equator, of, the, sun, thus, to, enter, an, orbit, passing, over, the, poles, of, the, sun, the, spacecraft, would, have, to, eliminate, the, speed, it, inherited, from, the, earth, s, orbit, around, the, sun, and, gain, the, speed, needed, to, orbit, the, sun, in, the, pole, to, pole, plane, it, was, achieved, by, a, gravity, assist, from, jupiter, on, february, 8, 1992, the, messenger, mission, launched, in, august, 2004, made, extensive, use, of, gravity, assists, to, slow, its, speed, before, orbiting, mercury, the, messenger, mission, included, one, flyby, of, earth, two, flybys, of, venus, and, three, flybys, of, mercury, before, finally, arriving, at, mercury, in, march, 2011, with, a, velocity, low, enough, to, permit, orbit, insertion, with, available, fuel, although, the, flybys, were, primarily, orbital, maneuvers, each, provided, an, opportunity, for, significant, scientific, observations, the, cassini, huygens, spacecraft, was, launched, from, earth, on, 15, october, 1997, followed, by, gravity, assist, flybys, of, venus, 26, april, 1998, and, 21, june, 1999, earth, 18, august, 1999, and, jupiter, 30, december, 2000, transit, to, saturn, took, 6, 7, years, the, spacecraft, arrived, at, 1, july, 2004, its, trajectory, was, called, the, most, complex, gravity, assist, trajectory, flown, to, date, in, 2019, after, entering, orbit, around, saturn, the, cassini, spacecraft, used, multiple, titan, gravity, assists, to, achieve, significant, changes, in, the, inclination, of, its, orbit, as, well, so, that, instead, of, staying, nearly, in, the, equatorial, plane, the, spacecraft, s, flight, path, was, inclined, well, out, of, the, plane, of, the, rings, a, typical, titan, encounter, changed, the, spacecraft, s, velocity, by, 0, 75, km, s, and, the, spacecraft, made, 127, titan, encounters, these, encounters, enabled, an, orbital, tour, with, a, wide, range, of, periapsis, and, apoapsis, distances, various, alignments, of, the, orbit, with, respect, to, the, sun, and, orbital, inclinations, from, 0, to, 74, the, multiple, flybys, of, titan, also, allowed, cassini, to, flyby, other, moons, such, as, rhea, and, enceladus, the, rosetta, probe, launched, in, march, 2004, used, four, gravity, assist, maneuvers, including, one, just, 250, km, from, the, surface, of, mars, and, three, assists, from, earth, to, accelerate, throughout, the, inner, solar, system, that, enabled, it, to, flyby, the, asteroids, 21, lutetia, and, 2867, teins, as, well, as, eventually, match, the, velocity, of, the, 67p, churyumov, gerasimenko, comet, at, the, rendezvous, point, in, august, 2014, new, horizons, was, launched, by, nasa, in, 2006, and, reached, pluto, in, 2015, in, 2007, it, performed, a, gravity, assist, on, jupiter, the, juno, spacecraft, was, launched, on, august, 5, 2011, utc, the, trajectory, used, a, gravity, assist, speed, boost, from, earth, accomplished, by, an, earth, flyby, in, october, 2013, two, years, after, its, launch, on, august, 5, 2011, in, that, way, juno, changed, its, orbit, and, speed, toward, its, final, goal, jupiter, after, only, five, years, the, parker, solar, probe, launched, by, nasa, in, 2018, has, seven, planned, venus, gravity, assists, each, gravity, assist, brings, the, parker, solar, probe, progressively, closer, to, the, sun, as, of, 2022, the, spacecraft, has, performed, five, of, its, seven, assists, the, parker, solar, probe, s, mission, will, make, the, closest, approach, to, the, sun, by, any, space, mission, solar, orbiter, was,
