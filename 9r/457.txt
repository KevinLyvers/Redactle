in, chemistry, cyanide, from, greek, kyanos, dark, blue, is, a, chemical, compound, that, contains, a, c, n, functional, group, this, group, known, as, the, cyano, group, consists, of, a, carbon, atom, triple, bonded, to, a, nitrogen, atom, in, inorganic, cyanides, the, cyanide, group, is, present, as, the, cyanide, anion, c, n, this, anion, is, extremely, poisonous, soluble, salts, such, as, sodium, cyanide, nacn, and, potassium, cyanide, kcn, are, highly, toxic, hydrocyanic, acid, also, known, as, hydrogen, cyanide, or, hcn, is, a, highly, volatile, liquid, that, is, produced, on, a, large, scale, industrially, it, is, obtained, by, acidification, of, cyanide, salts, organic, cyanides, are, usually, called, nitriles, in, nitriles, the, c, n, group, is, linked, by, a, single, covalent, bond, to, carbon, for, example, in, acetonitrile, ch, 3, c, n, the, cyanide, group, is, bonded, to, methyl, ch, 3, although, nitriles, generally, do, not, release, cyanide, ions, the, cyanohydrins, do, and, are, thus, toxic, the, cyanide, ion, c, n, is, isoelectronic, with, carbon, monoxide, c, o, and, with, molecular, nitrogen, n, n, a, triple, bond, exists, between, c, and, n, the, negative, charge, is, concentrated, on, carbon, c, cyanides, are, produced, by, certain, bacteria, fungi, and, algae, it, is, an, antifeedant, in, a, number, of, plants, cyanides, are, found, in, substantial, amounts, in, certain, seeds, and, fruit, stones, e, g, those, of, bitter, almonds, apricots, apples, and, peaches, chemical, compounds, that, can, release, cyanide, are, known, as, cyanogenic, compounds, in, plants, cyanides, are, usually, bound, to, sugar, molecules, in, the, form, of, cyanogenic, glycosides, and, defend, the, plant, against, herbivores, cassava, roots, also, called, manioc, an, important, potato, like, food, grown, in, tropical, countries, and, the, base, from, which, tapioca, is, made, also, contain, cyanogenic, glycosides, the, madagascar, bamboo, cathariostachys, madagascariensis, produces, cyanide, as, a, deterrent, to, grazing, in, response, the, golden, bamboo, lemur, which, eats, the, bamboo, has, developed, a, high, tolerance, to, cyanide, the, hydrogenase, enzymes, contain, cyanide, ligands, attached, to, iron, in, their, active, sites, the, biosynthesis, of, cyanide, in, the, nife, hydrogenases, proceeds, from, carbamoyl, phosphate, which, converts, to, cysteinyl, thiocyanate, the, cn, donor, the, cyanide, radical, cn, has, been, identified, in, interstellar, space, cyanogen, cn, 2, is, used, to, measure, the, temperature, of, interstellar, gas, clouds, hydrogen, cyanide, is, produced, by, the, combustion, or, pyrolysis, of, certain, materials, under, oxygen, deficient, conditions, for, example, it, can, be, detected, in, the, exhaust, of, internal, combustion, engines, and, tobacco, smoke, certain, plastics, especially, those, derived, from, acrylonitrile, release, hydrogen, cyanide, when, heated, or, burnt, in, iupac, nomenclature, organic, compounds, that, have, a, c, n, functional, group, are, called, nitriles, an, example, of, a, nitrile, is, acetonitrile, ch, 3, c, n, nitriles, usually, do, not, release, cyanide, ions, a, functional, group, with, a, hydroxyl, oh, and, cyanide, cn, bonded, to, the, same, carbon, atom, is, called, cyanohydrin, r, 2, c, oh, cn, unlike, nitriles, cyanohydrins, do, release, poisonous, hydrogen, cyanide, cyanide, is, basic, the, p, k, a, of, hydrogen, cyanide, is, 9, 21, thus, addition, of, acids, stronger, than, hydrogen, cyanide, to, solutions, of, cyanide, salts, releases, hydrogen, cyanide, cyanide, is, unstable, in, water, but, the, reaction, is, slow, until, about, 170, c, it, undergoes, hydrolysis, to, give, ammonia, and, formate, which, are, far, less, toxic, than, cyanide, cyanide, hydrolase, is, an, enzyme, that, catalyzes, this, reaction, because, of, the, cyanide, anion, s, high, nucleophilicity, cyano, groups, are, readily, introduced, into, organic, molecules, by, displacement, of, a, halide, group, e, g, the, chloride, on, methyl, chloride, in, general, organic, cyanides, are, called, nitriles, in, organic, synthesis, cyanide, is, a, c, 1, synthon, i, e, it, can, be, used, to, lengthen, a, carbon, chain, by, one, while, retaining, the, ability, to, be, functionalized, the, cyanide, ion, is, a, reductant, and, is, oxidized, by, strong, oxidizing, agents, such, as, molecular, chlorine, cl, 2, hypochlorite, clo, and, hydrogen, peroxide, h, 2, o, 2, these, oxidizers, are, used, to, destroy, cyanides, in, effluents, from, gold, mining, the, cyanide, anion, reacts, with, transition, metals, to, form, m, cn, bonds, this, reaction, is, the, basis, of, cyanide, s, toxicity, the, high, affinities, of, metals, for, this, anion, can, be, attributed, to, its, negative, charge, compactness, and, ability, to, engage, in, bonding, among, the, most, important, cyanide, coordination, compounds, are, the, potassium, ferrocyanide, and, the, pigment, prussian, blue, which, are, both, essentially, nontoxic, due, to, the, tight, binding, of, the, cyanides, to, a, central, iron, atom, prussian, blue, was, first, accidentally, made, around, 1706, by, heating, substances, containing, iron, and, carbon, and, nitrogen, and, other, cyanides, made, subsequently, and, named, after, it, among, its, many, uses, prussian, blue, gives, the, blue, color, to, blueprints, bluing, and, cyanotypes, the, principal, process, used, to, manufacture, cyanides, is, the, andrussow, process, in, which, gaseous, hydrogen, cyanide, is, produced, from, methane, and, ammonia, in, the, presence, of, oxygen, and, a, platinum, catalyst, sodium, cyanide, the, precursor, to, most, cyanides, is, produced, by, treating, hydrogen, cyanide, with, sodium, hydroxide, among, the, most, toxic, cyanides, are, hydrogen, cyanide, hcn, sodium, cyanide, nacn, potassium, cyanide, kcn, and, calcium, cyanide, ca, cn, these, compounds, are, extremely, poisonous, and, require, careful, handling, to, avoid, severe, health, risks, the, cyanide, anion, is, an, inhibitor, of, the, enzyme, cytochrome, c, oxidase, also, known, as, aa, 3, the, fourth, complex, of, the, electron, transport, chain, found, in, the, inner, membrane, of, the, mitochondria, of, eukaryotic, cells, it, attaches, to, the, iron, within, this, protein, the, binding, of, cyanide, to, this, enzyme, prevents, transport, of, electrons, from, cytochrome, c, to, oxygen, as, a, result, the, electron, transport, chain, is, disrupted, meaning, that, the, cell, can, no, longer, aerobically, produce, atp, for, energy, tissues, that, depend, highly, on, aerobic, respiration, such, as, the, central, nervous, system, and, the, heart, are, particularly, affected, this, is, an, example, of, histotoxic, hypoxia, the, most, hazardous, compound, is, hydrogen, cyanide, which, is, a, gas, and, kills, by, inhalation, for, this, reason, an, air, respirator, supplied, by, an, external, oxygen, source, must, be, worn, when, working, with, hydrogen, cyanide, hydrogen, cyanide, is, produced, by, adding, acid, to, a, solution, containing, a, cyanide, salt, alkaline, solutions, of, cyanide, are, safer, to, use, because, they, do, not, evolve, hydrogen, cyanide, gas, hydrogen, cyanide, may, be, produced, in, the, combustion, of, polyurethanes, for, this, reason, polyurethanes, are, not, recommended, for, use, in, domestic, and, aircraft, furniture, oral, ingestion, of, a, small, quantity, of, solid, cyanide, or, a, cyanide, solution, of, as, little, as, 200, mg, or, exposure, to, airborne, cyanide, of, 270, ppm, is, sufficient, to, cause, death, within, minutes, organic, nitriles, do, not, readily, release, cyanide, ions, and, so, have, low, toxicities, by, contrast, compounds, such, as, trimethylsilyl, cyanide, ch, 3, 3, sicn, readily, release, hcn, or, the, cyanide, ion, upon, contact, with, water, hydroxocobalamin, reacts, with, cyanide, to, form, cyanocobalamin, which, can, be, safely, eliminated, by, the, kidneys, this, method, has, the, advantage, of, avoiding, the, formation, of, methemoglobin, see, below, this, antidote, kit, is, sold, under, the, brand, name, cyanokit, and, was, approved, by, the, u, s, fda, in, 2006, an, older, cyanide, antidote, kit, included, administration, of, three, substances, amyl, nitrite, pearls, administered, by, inhalation, sodium, nitrite, and, sodium, thiosulfate, the, goal, of, the, antidote, was, to, generate, a, large, pool, of, ferric, iron, fe, 3, to, compete, for, cyanide, with, cytochrome, a, 3, so, that, cyanide, will, bind, to, the, antidote, rather, than, the, enzyme, the, nitrites, oxidize, hemoglobin, to, methemoglobin, which, competes, with, cytochrome, oxidase, for, the, cyanide, ion, cyanmethemoglobin, is, formed, and, the, cytochrome, oxidase, enzyme, is, restored, the, major, mechanism, to, remove, the, cyanide, from, the, body, is, by, enzymatic, conversion, to, thiocyanate, by, the, mitochondrial, enzyme, rhodanese, thiocyanate, is, a, relatively, non, toxic, molecule, and, is, excreted, by, the, kidneys, to, accelerate, this, detoxification, sodium, thiosulfate, is, administered, to, provide, a, sulfur, donor, for, rhodanese, needed, in, order, to, produce, thiocyanate, minimum, risk, levels, mrls, may, not, protect, for, delayed, health, effects, or, health, effects, acquired, following, repeated, sublethal, exposure, such, as, hypersensitivity, asthma, or, bronchitis, mrls, may, be, revised, after, sufficient, data, accumulates, cyanide, is, mainly, produced, for, the, mining, of, silver, and, gold, it, helps, dissolve, these, metals, allowing, separation, from, the, other, solids, in, the, cyanide, process, finely, ground, high, grade, ore, is, mixed, with, the, cyanide, at, a, ratio, of, about, 1, 500, parts, nacn, to, ore, low, grade, ores, are, stacked, into, heaps, and, sprayed, with, a, cyanide, solution, at, a, ratio, of, about, 1, 1000, parts, nacn, to, ore, the, precious, metals, are, complexed, by, the, cyanide, anions, to, form, soluble, derivatives, e, g, dicyanoargentate, i, and, dicyanoaurate, i, silver, is, less, noble, than, gold, and, often, occurs, as, the, sulfide, in, which, case, redox, is, not, invoked, no, o, 2, is, required, instead, a, displacement, reaction, occurs, the, pregnant, liquor, containing, these, ions, is, separated, from, the, solids, which, are, discarded, to, a, tailing, pond, or, spent, heap, the, recoverable, gold, having, been, removed, the, metal, is, recovered, from, the, pregnant, solution, by, reduction, with, zinc, dust, or, by, adsorption, onto, activated, carbon, this, process, can, result, in, environmental, and, health, problems, a, number, of, environmental, disasters, have, followed, the, overflow, of, tailing, ponds, at, gold, mines, cyanide, contamination, of, waterways, has, resulted, in, numerous, cases, of, human, and, aquatic, species, mortality, aqueous, cyanide, is, hydrolyzed, rapidly, especially, in, sunlight, it, can, mobilize, some, heavy, metals, such, as, mercury, if, present, gold, can, also, be, associated, with, arsenopyrite, feass, which, is, similar, to, iron, pyrite, fool, s, gold, wherein, half, of, the, sulfur, atoms, are, replaced, by, arsenic, gold, containing, arsenopyrite, ores, are, similarly, reactive, toward, inorganic, cyanide, the, second, major, application, of, alkali, metal, cyanides, after, mining, is, in, the, production, of, cn, containing, compounds, usually, nitriles, acyl, cyanides, are, produced, from, acyl, chlorides, and, cyanide, cyanogen, cyanogen, chloride, and, the, trimer, cyanuric, chloride, are, derived, from, alkali, metal, cyanides, the, cyanide, compound, sodium, nitroprusside, is, used, mainly, in, clinical, chemistry, to, measure, urine, ketone, bodies, mainly, as, a, follow, up, to, diabetic, patients, on, occasion, it, is, used, in, emergency, medical, situations, to, produce, a, rapid, decrease, in, blood, pressure, in, humans, it, is, also, used, as, a, vasodilator, in, vascular, research, the, cobalt, in, artificial, vitamin, b, 12, contains, a, cyanide, ligand, as, an, artifact, of, the, purification, process, this, must, be, removed, by, the, body, before, the, vitamin, molecule, can, be, activated, for, biochemical, use, during, world, war, i, a, copper, cyanide, compound, was, briefly, used, by, japanese, physicians, for, the, treatment, of, tuberculosis, and, leprosy, cyanides, are, illegally, used, to, capture, live, fish, near, coral, reefs, for, the, aquarium, and, seafood, markets, the, practice, is, controversial, dangerous, and, damaging, but, is, driven, by, the, lucrative, exotic, fish, market, poachers, in, africa, have, been, known, to, use, cyanide, to, poison, waterholes, to, kill, elephants, for, their, ivory, m44, cyanide, devices, are, used, in, the, united, states, to, kill, coyotes, and, other, canids, cyanide, is, also, used, for, pest, control, in, new, zealand, particularly, for, possums, an, introduced, marsupial, that, threatens, the, conservation, of, native, species, and, spreads, tuberculosis, amongst, cattle, possums, can, become, bait, shy, but, the, use, of, pellets, containing, the, cyanide, reduces, bait, shyness, cyanide, has, been, known, to, kill, native, birds, including, the, endangered, kiwi, cyanide, is, also, effective, for, controlling, the, dama, wallaby, another, introduced, marsupial, pest, in, new, zealand, a, licence, is, required, to, store, handle, and, use, cyanide, in, new, zealand, cyanides, are, used, as, insecticides, for, fumigating, ships, cyanide, salts, are, used, for, killing, ants, and, have, in, some, places, been, used, as, rat, poison, the, less, toxic, poison, arsenic, is, more, common, potassium, ferrocyanide, is, used, to, achieve, a, blue, color, on, cast, bronze, sculptures, during, the, final, finishing, stage, of, the, sculpture, on, its, own, it, will, produce, a, very, dark, shade, of, blue, and, is, often, mixed, with, other, chemicals, to, achieve, the, desired, tint, and, hue, it, is, applied, using, a, torch, and, paint, brush, while, wearing, the, standard, safety, equipment, used, for, any, patina, application, rubber, gloves, safety, glasses, and, a, respirator, the, actual, amount, of, cyanide, in, the, mixture, varies, according, to, the, recipes, used, by, each, foundry, cyanide, is, also, used, in, jewelry, making, and, certain, kinds, of, photography, such, as, sepia, toning, although, usually, thought, to, be, toxic, cyanide, and, cyanohydrins, increase, germination, in, various, plant, species, deliberate, cyanide, poisoning, of, humans, has, occurred, many, times, throughout, history, common, salts, such, as, sodium, cyanide, are, involatile, but, water, soluble, so, are, poisonous, by, ingestion, hydrogen, cyanide, is, a, gas, making, it, more, indiscriminately, dangerous, however, it, is, lighter, than, air, and, rapidly, disperses, up, into, the, atmosphere, which, makes, it, ineffective, as, a, chemical, weapon, because, of, the, high, stability, of, their, complexation, with, iron, ferrocyanides, sodium, ferrocyanide, e535, potassium, ferrocyanide, e536, and, calcium, ferrocyanide, e538, do, not, decompose, to, lethal, levels, in, the, human, body, and, are, used, in, the, food, industry, as, e, g, an, anticaking, agent, in, table, salt, cyanide, is, quantified, by, potentiometric, titration, a, method, widely, used, in, gold, mining, it, can, also, be, determined, by, titration, with, silver, ion, some, analyses, begin, with, an, air, purge, of, an, acidified, boiling, solution, sweeping, the, vapors, into, a, basic, absorber, solution, the, cyanide, salt, absorbed, in, the, basic, solution, is, then, analyzed, because, of, the, notorious, toxicity, of, cyanide, many, methods, have, been, investigated, benzidine, gives, a, blue, coloration, in, the, presence, of, ferricyanide, iron, ii, sulfate, added, to, a, solution, of, cyanide, such, as, the, filtrate, from, the, sodium, fusion, test, gives, prussian, blue, a, solution, of, para, benzoquinone, in, dmso, reacts, with, inorganic, cyanide, to, form, a, cyano, phenol, which, is, fluorescent, illumination, with, a, uv, light, gives, a, green, blue, glow, if, the, test, is, positive
