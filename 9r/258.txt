a, starburst, galaxy, is, one, undergoing, an, exceptionally, high, rate, of, star, formation, as, compared, to, the, long, term, average, rate, of, star, formation, in, the, galaxy, or, the, star, formation, rate, observed, in, most, other, galaxies, for, example, the, star, formation, rate, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, is, approximately, 3, m, yr, while, starburst, galaxies, can, experience, star, formation, rates, of, 100, m, yr, or, more, in, a, starburst, galaxy, the, rate, of, star, formation, is, so, large, that, the, galaxy, consumes, all, of, its, gas, reservoir, from, which, the, stars, are, forming, on, a, timescale, much, shorter, than, the, age, of, the, galaxy, as, such, the, starburst, nature, of, a, galaxy, is, a, phase, and, one, that, typically, occupies, a, brief, period, of, a, galaxy, s, evolution, the, majority, of, starburst, galaxies, are, in, the, midst, of, a, merger, or, close, encounter, with, another, galaxy, starburst, galaxies, include, m82, ngc, 4038, ngc, 4039, the, antennae, galaxies, and, ic, 10, starburst, galaxies, are, defined, by, these, three, interrelated, factors, commonly, used, definitions, include, mergers, and, tidal, interactions, between, gas, rich, galaxies, play, a, large, role, in, driving, starbursts, galaxies, in, the, midst, of, a, starburst, frequently, show, tidal, tails, an, indication, of, a, close, encounter, with, another, galaxy, or, are, in, the, midst, of, a, merger, turbulence, along, with, variations, of, time, and, space, cause, the, dense, gas, within, a, galaxy, to, compress, and, rapidly, increase, star, formation, the, efficiency, at, which, the, galaxy, forms, also, increases, its, sfr, these, changes, in, the, rate, of, star, formation, also, led, to, variations, with, depletion, time, and, power, a, starburst, with, its, own, galactic, mechanisms, rather, than, merging, with, another, galaxy, interactions, between, galaxies, that, do, not, merge, can, trigger, unstable, rotation, modes, such, as, the, bar, instability, which, causes, gas, to, be, funneled, towards, the, nucleus, and, ignites, bursts, of, star, formation, near, the, galactic, nucleus, it, has, been, shown, that, there, is, a, strong, correlation, between, the, lopsidedness, of, a, galaxy, and, the, youth, of, its, stellar, population, with, more, lopsided, galaxies, having, younger, central, stellar, populations, as, lopsidedness, can, be, caused, by, tidal, interactions, and, mergers, between, galaxies, this, result, gives, further, evidence, that, mergers, and, tidal, interactions, can, induce, central, star, formation, in, a, galaxy, and, drive, a, starburst, classifying, types, of, starburst, galaxies, is, difficult, since, starburst, galaxies, do, not, represent, a, specific, type, in, and, of, themselves, starbursts, can, occur, in, disk, galaxies, and, irregular, galaxies, often, exhibit, knots, of, starburst, spread, throughout, the, irregular, galaxy, nevertheless, astronomers, typically, classify, starburst, galaxies, based, on, their, most, distinct, observational, characteristics, some, of, the, categorizations, include, firstly, a, starburst, galaxy, must, have, a, large, supply, of, gas, available, to, form, stars, the, burst, itself, may, be, triggered, by, a, close, encounter, with, another, galaxy, such, as, m81, m82, a, collision, with, another, galaxy, such, as, the, antennae, or, by, another, process, that, forces, material, into, the, centre, of, the, galaxy, such, as, a, stellar, bar, the, inside, of, the, starburst, is, quite, an, extreme, environment, the, large, amounts, of, gas, mean, that, massive, stars, are, formed, young, hot, stars, ionize, the, gas, mainly, hydrogen, around, them, creating, h, ii, regions, groups, of, hot, stars, are, known, as, ob, associations, these, stars, burn, bright, and, fast, and, are, quite, likely, to, explode, at, the, end, of, their, lives, as, supernovae, after, the, supernova, explosion, the, ejected, material, expands, and, becomes, a, supernova, remnant, these, remnants, interact, with, the, surrounding, environment, within, the, starburst, the, interstellar, medium, and, can, be, the, site, of, naturally, occurring, masers, studying, nearby, starburst, galaxies, can, help, us, determine, the, history, of, galaxy, formation, and, evolution, large, numbers, of, the, most, distant, galaxies, seen, for, example, in, the, hubble, deep, field, are, known, to, be, starbursts, but, they, are, too, far, away, to, be, studied, in, any, detail, observing, nearby, examples, and, exploring, their, characteristics, can, give, us, an, idea, of, what, was, happening, in, the, early, universe, as, the, light, we, see, from, these, distant, galaxies, left, them, when, the, universe, was, much, younger, see, redshift, however, starburst, galaxies, seem, to, be, quite, rare, in, our, local, universe, and, are, more, common, further, away, indicating, that, there, were, more, of, them, billions, of, years, ago, all, galaxies, were, closer, together, then, and, therefore, more, likely, to, be, influenced, by, each, other, s, gravity, more, frequent, encounters, produced, more, starbursts, as, galactic, forms, evolved, with, the, expanding, universe, m82, is, the, archetypal, starburst, galaxy, its, high, level, of, star, formation, is, due, to, a, close, encounter, with, the, nearby, spiral, m81, maps, of, the, regions, made, with, radio, telescopes, show, large, streams, of, neutral, hydrogen, connecting, the, two, galaxies, also, as, a, result, of, the, encounter, radio, images, of, the, central, regions, of, m82, also, show, a, large, number, of, young, supernova, remnants, left, behind, when, the, more, massive, stars, created, in, the, starburst, came, to, the, end, of, their, lives, the, antennae, is, another, starburst, system, detailed, by, a, hubble, picture, released, in, 1997
