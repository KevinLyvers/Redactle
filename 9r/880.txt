a, liquid, is, a, nearly, incompressible, fluid, that, conforms, to, the, shape, of, its, container, but, retains, a, nearly, constant, volume, independent, of, pressure, it, is, one, of, the, four, fundamental, states, of, matter, the, others, being, solid, gas, and, plasma, and, is, the, only, state, with, a, definite, volume, but, no, fixed, shape, the, density, of, a, liquid, is, usually, close, to, that, of, a, solid, and, much, higher, than, that, of, a, gas, therefore, liquid, and, solid, are, both, termed, condensed, matter, on, the, other, hand, as, liquids, and, gases, share, the, ability, to, flow, they, are, both, called, fluids, a, liquid, is, made, up, of, tiny, vibrating, particles, of, matter, such, as, atoms, held, together, by, intermolecular, bonds, like, a, gas, a, liquid, is, able, to, flow, and, take, the, shape, of, a, container, unlike, a, gas, a, liquid, maintains, a, fairly, constant, density, and, does, not, disperse, to, fill, every, space, of, a, container, although, liquid, water, is, abundant, on, earth, this, state, of, matter, is, actually, the, least, common, in, the, known, universe, because, liquids, require, a, relatively, narrow, temperature, pressure, range, to, exist, most, known, matter, in, the, universe, is, either, gas, as, interstellar, clouds, or, plasma, as, stars, liquid, is, one, of, the, four, primary, states, of, matter, with, the, others, being, solid, gas, and, plasma, a, liquid, is, a, fluid, unlike, a, solid, the, molecules, in, a, liquid, have, a, much, greater, freedom, to, move, the, forces, that, bind, the, molecules, together, in, a, solid, are, only, temporary, in, a, liquid, allowing, a, liquid, to, flow, while, a, solid, remains, rigid, a, liquid, like, a, gas, displays, the, properties, of, a, fluid, a, liquid, can, flow, assume, the, shape, of, a, container, and, if, placed, in, a, sealed, container, will, distribute, applied, pressure, evenly, to, every, surface, in, the, container, if, liquid, is, placed, in, a, bag, it, can, be, squeezed, into, any, shape, unlike, a, gas, a, liquid, is, nearly, incompressible, meaning, that, it, occupies, nearly, a, constant, volume, over, a, wide, range, of, pressures, it, does, not, generally, expand, to, fill, available, space, in, a, container, but, forms, its, own, surface, and, it, may, not, always, mix, readily, with, another, liquid, these, properties, make, a, liquid, suitable, for, applications, such, as, hydraulics, liquid, particles, are, bound, firmly, but, not, rigidly, they, are, able, to, move, around, one, another, freely, resulting, in, a, limited, degree, of, particle, mobility, as, the, temperature, increases, the, increased, vibrations, of, the, molecules, causes, distances, between, the, molecules, to, increase, when, a, liquid, reaches, its, boiling, point, the, cohesive, forces, that, bind, the, molecules, closely, together, break, and, the, liquid, changes, to, its, gaseous, state, unless, superheating, occurs, if, the, temperature, is, decreased, the, distances, between, the, molecules, become, smaller, when, the, liquid, reaches, its, freezing, point, the, molecules, will, usually, lock, into, a, very, specific, order, called, crystallizing, and, the, bonds, between, them, become, more, rigid, changing, the, liquid, into, its, solid, state, unless, supercooling, occurs, only, two, elements, are, liquid, at, standard, conditions, for, temperature, and, pressure, mercury, and, bromine, four, more, elements, have, melting, points, slightly, above, room, temperature, francium, caesium, gallium, and, rubidium, in, addition, certain, mixtures, of, elements, are, liquid, at, room, temperature, even, if, the, individual, elements, are, solid, under, the, same, conditions, see, eutectic, mixture, an, example, is, the, sodium, potassium, metal, alloy, nak, other, metal, alloys, that, are, liquid, at, room, temperature, include, galinstan, which, is, a, gallium, indium, tin, alloy, that, melts, at, 19, c, 2, f, as, well, as, some, amalgams, alloys, involving, mercury, pure, substances, that, are, liquid, under, normal, conditions, include, water, ethanol, and, many, other, organic, solvents, liquid, water, is, of, vital, importance, in, chemistry, and, biology, and, it, is, necessary, for, all, known, forms, of, life, inorganic, liquids, include, water, magma, inorganic, nonaqueous, solvents, and, many, acids, important, everyday, liquids, include, aqueous, solutions, like, household, bleach, other, mixtures, of, different, substances, such, as, mineral, oil, and, gasoline, emulsions, like, vinaigrette, or, mayonnaise, suspensions, like, blood, and, colloids, like, paint, and, milk, many, gases, can, be, liquefied, by, cooling, producing, liquids, such, as, liquid, oxygen, liquid, nitrogen, liquid, hydrogen, and, liquid, helium, not, all, gases, can, be, liquified, at, atmospheric, pressure, however, carbon, dioxide, for, example, can, only, be, liquified, at, pressures, above, 5, 1, atm, some, materials, cannot, be, classified, within, the, classical, three, states, of, matter, for, example, liquid, crystals, used, in, liquid, crystal, displays, possess, both, solid, like, and, liquid, like, properties, and, belong, to, their, own, state, of, matter, distinct, from, either, liquid, or, solid, liquids, are, useful, as, lubricants, due, to, their, ability, to, form, a, thin, freely, flowing, layer, between, solid, materials, lubricants, such, as, oil, are, chosen, for, viscosity, and, flow, characteristics, that, are, suitable, throughout, the, operating, temperature, range, of, the, component, oils, are, often, used, in, engines, gear, boxes, metalworking, and, hydraulic, systems, for, their, good, lubrication, properties, many, liquids, are, used, as, solvents, to, dissolve, other, liquids, or, solids, solutions, are, found, in, a, wide, variety, of, applications, including, paints, sealants, and, adhesives, naphtha, and, acetone, are, used, frequently, in, industry, to, clean, oil, grease, and, tar, from, parts, and, machinery, body, fluids, are, water, based, solutions, surfactants, are, commonly, found, in, soaps, and, detergents, solvents, like, alcohol, are, often, used, as, antimicrobials, they, are, found, in, cosmetics, inks, and, liquid, dye, lasers, they, are, used, in, the, food, industry, in, processes, such, as, the, extraction, of, vegetable, oil, liquids, tend, to, have, better, thermal, conductivity, than, gases, and, the, ability, to, flow, makes, a, liquid, suitable, for, removing, excess, heat, from, mechanical, components, the, heat, can, be, removed, by, channeling, the, liquid, through, a, heat, exchanger, such, as, a, radiator, or, the, heat, can, be, removed, with, the, liquid, during, evaporation, water, or, glycol, coolants, are, used, to, keep, engines, from, overheating, the, coolants, used, in, nuclear, reactors, include, water, or, liquid, metals, such, as, sodium, or, bismuth, liquid, propellant, films, are, used, to, cool, the, thrust, chambers, of, rockets, in, machining, water, and, oils, are, used, to, remove, the, excess, heat, generated, which, can, quickly, ruin, both, the, work, piece, and, the, tooling, during, perspiration, sweat, removes, heat, from, the, human, body, by, evaporating, in, the, heating, ventilation, and, air, conditioning, industry, hvac, liquids, such, as, water, are, used, to, transfer, heat, from, one, area, to, another, liquids, are, often, used, in, cooking, due, to, their, excellent, heat, transfer, capabilities, in, addition, to, thermal, conduction, liquids, transmit, energy, by, convection, in, particular, because, warmer, fluids, expand, and, rise, while, cooler, areas, contract, and, sink, liquids, with, low, kinematic, viscosity, tend, to, transfer, heat, through, convection, at, a, fairly, constant, temperature, making, a, liquid, suitable, for, blanching, boiling, or, frying, even, higher, rates, of, heat, transfer, can, be, achieved, by, condensing, a, gas, into, a, liquid, at, the, liquid, s, boiling, point, all, of, the, heat, energy, is, used, to, cause, the, phase, change, from, a, liquid, to, a, gas, without, an, accompanying, increase, in, temperature, and, is, stored, as, chemical, potential, energy, when, the, gas, condenses, back, into, a, liquid, this, excess, heat, energy, is, released, at, a, constant, temperature, this, phenomenon, is, used, in, processes, such, as, steaming, since, liquids, often, have, different, boiling, points, mixtures, or, solutions, of, liquids, or, gases, can, typically, be, separated, by, distillation, using, heat, cold, vacuum, pressure, or, other, means, distillation, can, be, found, in, everything, from, the, production, of, alcoholic, beverages, to, oil, refineries, to, the, cryogenic, distillation, of, gases, such, as, argon, oxygen, nitrogen, neon, or, xenon, by, liquefaction, cooling, them, below, their, individual, boiling, points, liquid, is, the, primary, component, of, hydraulic, systems, which, take, advantage, of, pascal, s, law, to, provide, fluid, power, devices, such, as, pumps, and, waterwheels, have, been, used, to, change, liquid, motion, into, mechanical, work, since, ancient, times, oils, are, forced, through, hydraulic, pumps, which, transmit, this, force, to, hydraulic, cylinders, hydraulics, can, be, found, in, many, applications, such, as, automotive, brakes, and, transmissions, heavy, equipment, and, airplane, control, systems, various, hydraulic, presses, are, used, extensively, in, repair, and, manufacturing, for, lifting, pressing, clamping, and, forming, liquid, metals, have, several, properties, that, are, useful, in, sensing, and, actuation, particularly, their, electrical, conductivity, and, ability, to, transmit, forces, incompressibility, as, freely, flowing, substances, liquid, metals, retain, these, bulk, properties, even, under, extreme, deformation, for, this, reason, they, have, been, proposed, for, use, in, soft, robots, and, wearable, healthcare, devices, which, must, be, able, to, operate, under, repeated, deformation, the, metal, gallium, is, considered, to, be, a, promising, candidate, for, these, applications, as, it, is, a, liquid, near, room, temperature, has, low, toxicity, and, evaporates, slowly, liquids, are, sometimes, used, in, measuring, devices, a, thermometer, often, uses, the, thermal, expansion, of, liquids, such, as, mercury, combined, with, their, ability, to, flow, to, indicate, temperature, a, manometer, uses, the, weight, of, the, liquid, to, indicate, air, pressure, the, free, surface, of, a, rotating, liquid, forms, a, circular, paraboloid, and, can, therefore, be, used, as, a, telescope, these, are, known, as, liquid, mirror, telescopes, they, are, significantly, cheaper, than, conventional, telescopes, but, can, only, point, straight, upward, zenith, telescope, a, common, choice, for, the, liquid, is, mercury, quantities, of, liquids, are, measured, in, units, of, volume, these, include, the, si, unit, cubic, metre, m, 3, and, its, divisions, in, particular, the, cubic, decimeter, more, commonly, called, the, litre, 1, dm, 3, 1, l, 0, 001, m, 3, and, the, cubic, centimetre, also, called, millilitre, 1, cm, 3, 1, ml, 0, 001, l, 10, 6, m, 3, the, volume, of, a, quantity, of, liquid, is, fixed, by, its, temperature, and, pressure, liquids, generally, expand, when, heated, and, contract, when, cooled, water, between, 0, c, and, 4, c, is, a, notable, exception, on, the, other, hand, liquids, have, little, compressibility, water, for, example, will, compress, by, only, 46, 4, parts, per, million, for, every, unit, increase, in, atmospheric, pressure, bar, at, around, 4000, bar, 400, megapascals, or, 58, 000, psi, of, pressure, at, room, temperature, water, experiences, only, an, 11, decrease, in, volume, incompressibility, makes, liquids, suitable, for, transmitting, hydraulic, power, because, a, change, in, pressure, at, one, point, in, a, liquid, is, transmitted, undiminished, to, every, other, part, of, the, liquid, and, very, little, energy, is, lost, in, the, form, of, compression, however, the, negligible, compressibility, does, lead, to, other, phenomena, the, banging, of, pipes, called, water, hammer, occurs, when, a, valve, is, suddenly, closed, creating, a, huge, pressure, spike, at, the, valve, that, travels, backward, through, the, system, at, just, under, the, speed, of, sound, another, phenomenon, caused, by, liquid, s, incompressibility, is, cavitation, because, liquids, have, little, elasticity, they, can, literally, be, pulled, apart, in, areas, of, high, turbulence, or, dramatic, change, in, direction, such, as, the, trailing, edge, of, a, boat, propeller, or, a, sharp, corner, in, a, pipe, a, liquid, in, an, area, of, low, pressure, vacuum, vaporizes, and, forms, bubbles, which, then, collapse, as, they, enter, high, pressure, areas, this, causes, liquid, to, fill, the, cavities, left, by, the, bubbles, with, tremendous, localized, force, eroding, any, adjacent, solid, surface, in, a, gravitational, field, liquids, exert, pressure, on, the, sides, of, a, container, as, well, as, on, anything, within, the, liquid, itself, this, pressure, is, transmitted, in, all, directions, and, increases, with, depth, if, a, liquid, is, at, rest, in, a, uniform, gravitational, field, the, pressure, p, displaystyle, p, at, depth, z, displaystyle, z, is, given, by, where, for, a, body, of, water, open, to, the, air, p, 0, displaystyle, p, 0, would, be, the, atmospheric, pressure, static, liquids, in, uniform, gravitational, fields, also, exhibit, the, phenomenon, of, buoyancy, where, objects, immersed, in, the, liquid, experience, a, net, force, due, to, the, pressure, variation, with, depth, the, magnitude, of, the, force, is, equal, to, the, weight, of, the, liquid, displaced, by, the, object, and, the, direction, of, the, force, depends, on, the, average, density, of, the, immersed, object, if, the, density, is, smaller, than, that, of, the, liquid, the, buoyant, force, points, upward, and, the, object, floats, whereas, if, the, density, is, larger, the, buoyant, force, points, downward, and, the, object, sinks, this, is, known, as, archimedes, principle, unless, the, volume, of, a, liquid, exactly, matches, the, volume, of, its, container, one, or, more, surfaces, are, observed, the, presence, of, a, surface, introduces, new, phenomena, which, are, not, present, in, a, bulk, liquid, this, is, because, a, molecule, at, a, surface, possesses, bonds, with, other, liquid, molecules, only, on, the, inner, side, of, the, surface, which, implies, a, net, force, pulling, surface, molecules, inward, equivalently, this, force, can, be, described, in, terms, of, energy, there, is, a, fixed, amount, of, energy, associated, with, forming, a, surface, of, a, given, area, this, quantity, is, a, material, property, called, the, surface, tension, in, units, of, energy, per, unit, area, si, units, j, m, 2, liquids, with, strong, intermolecular, forces, tend, to, have, large, surface, tensions, a, practical, implication, of, surface, tension, is, that, liquids, tend, to, minimize, their, surface, area, forming, spherical, drops, and, bubbles, unless, other, constraints, are, present, surface, tension, is, responsible, for, a, range, of, other, phenomena, as, well, including, surface, waves, capillary, action, wetting, and, ripples, in, liquids, under, nanoscale, confinement, surface, effects, can, play, a, dominating, role, since, compared, with, a, macroscopic, sample, of, liquid, a, much, greater, fraction, of, molecules, are, located, near, a, surface, the, surface, tension, of, a, liquid, directly, affects, its, wettability, most, common, liquids, have, tensions, ranging, in, the, tens, of, mj, m, 2, so, droplets, of, oil, water, or, glue, can, easily, merge, and, adhere, to, other, surfaces, whereas, liquid, metals, such, as, mercury, may, have, tensions, ranging, in, the, hundreds, of, mj, m, 2, thus, droplets, do, not, combine, easily, and, surfaces, may, only, wet, under, specific, conditions, the, surface, tensions, of, common, liquids, occupy, a, relatively, narrow, range, of, values, when, exposed, to, changing, conditions, such, as, temperature, which, contrasts, strongly, with, the, enormous, variation, seen, in, other, mechanical, properties, such, as, viscosity, the, free, surface, of, a, liquid, is, disturbed, by, gravity, flatness, and, waves, surface, roughness, an, important, physical, property, characterizing, the, flow, of, liquids, is, viscosity, intuitively, viscosity, describes, the, resistance, of, a, liquid, to, flow, more, technically, viscosity, measures, the, resistance, of, a, liquid, to, deformation, at, a, given, rate, such, as, when, it, is, being, sheared, at, finite, velocity, a, specific, example, is, a, liquid, flowing, through, a, pipe, in, this, case, the, liquid, undergoes, shear, deformation, since, it, flows, more, slowly, near, the, walls, of, the, pipe, than, near, the, center, as, a, result, it, exhibits, viscous, resistance, to, flow, in, order, to, maintain, flow, an, external, force, must, be, applied, such, as, a, pressure, difference, between, the, ends, of, the, pipe, the, viscosity, of, liquids, decreases, with, increasing, temperature, precise, control, of, viscosity, is, important, in, many, applications, particularly, the, lubrication, industry, one, way, to, achieve, such, control, is, by, blending, two, or, more, liquids, of, differing, viscosities, in, precise, ratios, in, addition, various, additives, exist, which, can, modulate, the, temperature, dependence, of, the, viscosity, of, lubricating, oils, this, capability, is, important, since, machinery, often, operate, over, a, range, of, temperatures, see, also, viscosity, index, the, viscous, behavior, of, a, liquid, can, be, either, newtonian, or, non, newtonian, a, newtonian, liquid, exhibits, a, linear, strain, stress, curve, meaning, its, viscosity, is, independent, of, time, shear, rate, or, shear, rate, history, examples, of, newtonian, liquids, include, water, glycerin, motor, oil, honey, or, mercury, a, non, newtonian, liquid, is, one, where, the, viscosity, is, not, independent, of, these, factors, and, either, thickens, increases, in, viscosity, or, thins, decreases, in, viscosity, under, shear, examples, of, non, newtonian, liquids, include, ketchup, custard, or, starch, solutions, the, speed, of, sound, in, a, liquid, is, given, by, c, k, displaystyle, c, sqrt, k, rho, where, k, displaystyle, k, is, the, bulk, modulus, of, the, liquid, and, displaystyle, rho, the, density, as, an, example, water, has, a, bulk, modulus, of, about, 2, 2, gpa, and, a, density, of, 1000, kg, m, 3, which, gives, c, 1, 5, km, s, at, a, temperature, below, the, boiling, point, any, matter, in, liquid, form, will, evaporate, until, reaching, equilibrium, with, the, reverse, process, of, condensation, of, its, vapor, at, this, point, the, vapor, will, condense, at, the, same, rate, as, the, liquid, evaporates, thus, a, liquid, cannot, exist, permanently, if, the, evaporated, liquid, is, continually, removed, a, liquid, at, or, above, its, boiling, point, will, normally, boil, though, superheating, can, prevent, this, in, certain, circumstances, at, a, temperature, below, the, freezing, point, a, liquid, will, tend, to, crystallize, changing, to, its, solid, form, unlike, the, transition, to, gas, there, is, no, equilibrium, at, this, transition, under, constant, pressure, so, unless, supercooling, occurs, the, liquid, will, eventually, completely, crystallize, however, this, is, only, true, under, constant, pressure, so, that, for, example, water, and, ice, in, a, closed, strong, container, might, reach, an, equilibrium, where, both, phases, coexist, for, the, opposite, transition, from, solid, to, liquid, see, melting, the, phase, diagram, explains, why, liquids, do, not, exist, in, space, or, any, other, vacuum, since, the, pressure, is, essentially, zero, except, on, surfaces, or, interiors, of, planets, and, moons, water, and, other, liquids, exposed, to, space, will, either, immediately, boil, or, freeze, depending, on, the, temperature, in, regions, of, space, near, the, earth, water, will, freeze, if, the, sun, is, not, shining, directly, on, it, and, vaporize, sublime, as, soon, as, it, is, in, sunlight, if, water, exists, as, ice, on, the, moon, it, can, only, exist, in, shadowed, holes, where, the, sun, never, shines, and, where, the, surrounding, rock, does, not, heat, it, up, too, much, at, some, point, near, the, orbit, of, saturn, the, light, from, the, sun, is, too, faint, to, sublime, ice, to, water, vapor, this, is, evident, from, the, longevity, of, the, ice, that, composes, saturn, s, rings, liquids, can, form, solutions, with, gases, solids, and, other, liquids, two, liquids, are, said, to, be, miscible, if, they, can, form, a, solution, in, any, proportion, otherwise, they, are, immiscible, as, an, example, water, and, ethanol, drinking, alcohol, are, miscible, whereas, water, and, gasoline, are, immiscible, in, some, cases, a, mixture, of, otherwise, immiscible, liquids, can, be, stabilized, to, form, an, emulsion, where, one, liquid, is, dispersed, throughout, the, other, as, microscopic, droplets, usually, this, requires, the, presence, of, a, surfactant, in, order, to, stabilize, the, droplets, a, familiar, example, of, an, emulsion, is, mayonnaise, which, consists, of, a, mixture, of, water, and, oil, that, is, stabilized, by, lecithin, a, substance, found, in, egg, yolks, the, microscopic, structure, of, liquids, is, complex, and, historically, has, been, the, subject, of, intense, research, and, debate, a, few, of, the, key, ideas, are, explained, below, microscopically, liquids, consist, of, a, dense, disordered, packing, of, molecules, this, contrasts, with, the, other, two, common, phases, of, matter, gases, and, solids, although, gases, are, disordered, the, molecules, are, well, separated, in, space, and, interact, primarily, through, molecule, molecule, collisions, conversely, although, the, molecules, in, solids, are, densely, packed, they, usually, fall, into, a, regular, structure, such, as, a, crystalline, lattice, glasses, are, a, notable, exception, while, liquids, do, not, exhibit, long, range, ordering, as, in, a, crystalline, lattice, they, do, possess, short, range, order, which, persists, over, a, few, molecular, diameters, in, all, liquids, excluded, volume, interactions, induce, short, range, order, in, molecular, positions, center, of, mass, coordinates, classical, monatomic, liquids, like, argon, and, krypton, are, the, simplest, examples, such, liquids, can, be, modeled, as, disordered, heaps, of, closely, packed, spheres, and, the, short, range, order, corresponds, to, the, fact, that, nearest, and, next, nearest, neighbors, in, a, packing, of, spheres, tend, to, be, separated, by, integer, multiples, of, the, diameter, in, most, liquids, molecules, are, not, spheres, and, intermolecular, forces, possess, a, directionality, i, e, they, depend, on, the, relative, orientation, of, molecules, as, a, result, there, is, short, ranged, orientational, order, in, addition, to, the, positional, order, mentioned, above, orientational, order, is, especially, important, in, hydrogen, bonded, liquids, like, water, the, strength, and, directional, nature, of, hydrogen, bonds, drives, the, formation, of, local, networks, or, clusters, of, molecules, due, to, the, relative, importance, of, thermal, fluctuations, in, liquids, compared, with, solids, these, structures, are, highly, dynamic, continuously, deforming, breaking, and, reforming, the, microscopic, features, of, liquids, derive, from, an, interplay, between, attractive, intermolecular, forces, and, entropic, forces, the, attractive, forces, tend, to, pull, molecules, close, together, and, along, with, short, range, repulsive, interactions, they, are, the, dominant, forces, behind, the, regular, structure, of, solids, the, entropic, forces, are, not, forces, in, the, mechanical, sense, rather, they, describe, the, tendency, of, a, system, to, maximize, its, entropy, at, fixed, energy, see, microcanonical, ensemble, roughly, speaking, entropic, forces, drive, molecules, apart, from, each, other, maximizing, the, volume, they, occupy, entropic, forces, dominant, in, gases, and, explain, the, tendency, of, gases, to, fill, their, containers, in, liquids, by, contrast, the, intermolecular, and, entropic, forces, are, comparable, so, it, is, not, possible, to, neglect, one, in, favor, of, the, other, quantitatively, the, binding, energy, between, adjacent, molecules, is, the, same, order, of, magnitude, as, the, thermal, energy, k, b, t, displaystyle, k, text, b, t, the, competition, between, energy, and, entropy, makes, liquids, difficult, to, model, at, the, molecular, level, as, there, is, no, idealized, reference, state, that, can, serve, as, a, starting, point, for, tractable, theoretical, descriptions, mathematically, there, is, no, small, parameter, from, which, one, can, develop, a, systematic, perturbation, theory, this, situation, contrasts, with, both, gases, and, solids, for, gases, the, reference, state, is, the, ideal, gas, and, the, density, can, be, used, as, a, small, parameter, to, construct, a, theory, of, real, nonideal, gases, see, virial, expansion, for, crystalline, solids, the, reference, state, is, a, perfect, crystalline, lattice, and, possible, small, parameters, are, thermal, motions, and, lattice, defects, like, all, known, forms, of, matter, liquids, are, fundamentally, quantum, mechanical, however, under, standard, conditions, near, room, temperature, and, pressure, much, of, the, macroscopic, behavior, of, liquids, can, be, understood, in, terms, of, classical, mechanics, the, classical, picture, posits, that, the, constituent, molecules, are, discrete, entities, that, interact, through, intermolecular, forces, according, to, newton, s, laws, of, motion, as, a, result, their, macroscopic, properties, can, be, described, using, classical, statistical, mechanics, while, the, intermolecular, force, law, technically, derives, from, quantum, mechanics, it, is, usually, understood, as, a, model, input, to, classical, theory, obtained, either, from, a, fit, to, experimental, data, or, from, the, classical, limit, of, a, quantum, mechanical, description, an, illustrative, though, highly, simplified, example, is, a, collection, of, spherical, molecules, interacting, through, a, lennard, jones, potential, for, the, classical, limit, to, apply, a, necessary, condition, is, that, the, thermal, de, broglie, wavelength, is, small, compared, with, the, length, scale, under, consideration, here, displaystyle, hbar, is, the, planck, constant, and, m, displaystyle, m, is, the, molecule, s, mass, typical, values, of, displaystyle, lambda, are, about, 0, 01, 0, 1, nanometers, table, 1, hence, a, high, resolution, model, of, liquid, structure, at, the, nanoscale, may, require, quantum, mechanical, considerations, a, notable, example, is, hydrogen, bonding, in, associated, liquids, like, water, where, due, to, the, small, mass, of, the, proton, inherently, quantum, effects, such, as, zero, point, motion, and, tunneling, are, important, for, a, liquid, to, behave, classically, at, the, macroscopic, level, displaystyle, lambda, must, be, small, compared, with, the, average, distance, a, 1, 3, displaystyle, a, approx, rho, 1, 3, between, molecules, that, is, representative, values, of, this, ratio, for, a, few, liquids, are, given, in, table, 1, the, conclusion, is, that, quantum, effects, are, important, for, liquids, at, low, temperatures, and, with, small, molecular, mass, for, dynamic, processes, there, is, an, additional, timescale, constraint, where, displaystyle, tau, is, the, timescale, of, the, process, under, consideration, for, room, temperature, liquids, the, right, hand, side, is, about, 10, 14, seconds, which, generally, means, that, time, dependent, processes, involving, translational, motion, can, be, described, classically, at, extremely, low, temperatures, even, the, macroscopic, behavior, of, certain, liquids, deviates, from, classical, mechanics, notable, examples, are, hydrogen, and, helium, due, to, their, low, temperature, and, mass, such, liquids, have, a, thermal, de, broglie, wavelength, comparable, to, the, average, distance, between, molecules, the, expression, for, the, sound, velocity, of, a, liquid, contains, the, bulk, modulus, k, if, k, is, frequency, independent, then, the, liquid, behaves, as, a, linear, medium, so, that, sound, propagates, without, dissipation, or, mode, coupling, in, reality, all, liquids, show, some, dispersion, with, increasing, frequency, k, crosses, over, from, the, low, frequency, liquid, like, limit, k, 0, displaystyle, k, 0, to, the, high, frequency, solid, like, limit, k, displaystyle, k, infty, in, normal, liquids, most, of, this, crossover, takes, place, at, frequencies, between, ghz, and, thz, sometimes, called, hypersound, at, sub, ghz, frequencies, a, normal, liquid, cannot, sustain, shear, waves, the, zero, frequency, limit, of, the, shear, modulus, is, 0, this, is, sometimes, seen, as, the, defining, property, of, a, liquid, however, like, the, bulk, modulus, k, the, shear, modulus, g, is, also, frequency, dependent, and, exhibits, a, similar, crossover, at, hypersound, frequencies, according, to, linear, response, theory, the, fourier, transform, of, k, or, g, describes, how, the, system, returns, to, equilibrium, after, an, external, perturbation, for, this, reason, the, dispersion, step, in, the, ghz, to, thz, region, is, also, called, relaxation, as, a, liquid, is, supercooled, toward, the, glass, transition, the, structural, relaxation, time, exponentially, increases, which, explains, the, viscoelastic, behavior, of, glass, forming, liquids, the, absence, of, long, range, order, in, liquids, is, mirrored, by, the, absence, of, bragg, peaks, in, x, ray, and, neutron, diffraction, under, normal, conditions, the, diffraction, pattern, has, circular, symmetry, expressing, the, isotropy, of, the, liquid, radially, the, diffraction, intensity, smoothly, oscillates, this, can, be, described, by, the, static, structure, factor, s, q, displaystyle, s, q, with, wavenumber, q, 4, sin, displaystyle, q, 4, pi, lambda, sin, theta, given, by, the, wavelength, displaystyle, lambda, of, the, probe, photon, or, neutron, and, the, bragg, angle, displaystyle, theta, the, oscillations, of, s, q, displaystyle, s, q, express, the, short, range, order, of, the, liquid, i, e, the, correlations, between, a, molecule, and, shells, of, nearest, neighbors, next, nearest, neighbors, and, so, on, an, equivalent, representation, of, these, correlations, is, the, radial, distribution, function, g, r, displaystyle, g, r, which, is, related, to, the, fourier, transform, of, s, q, displaystyle, s, q, it, represents, a, spatial, average, of, a, temporal, snapshot, of, pair, correlations, in, the, liquid, methods, for, predicting, liquid, properties, can, be, organized, by, their, scale, of, description, that, is, the, length, scales, and, time, scales, over, which, they, apply, empirical, correlations, are, simple, mathematical, expressions, intended, to, approximate, a, liquid, s, properties, over, a, range, of, experimental, conditions, such, as, varying, temperature, and, pressure, they, are, constructed, by, fitting, simple, functional, forms, to, experimental, data, for, example, the, temperature, dependence, of, liquid, viscosity, is, sometimes, approximated, by, the, function, t, a, e, b, t, displaystyle, eta, t, ae, b, t, where, a, displaystyle, a, and, b, displaystyle, b, are, fitting, constants, empirical, correlations, allow, for, extremely, efficient, estimates, of, physical, properties, which, can, be, useful, in, thermophysical, simulations, however, they, require, high, quality, experimental, data, to, obtain, a, good, fit, and, cannot, reliably, extrapolate, beyond, the, conditions, covered, by, experiments, thermodynamic, potentials, are, functions, that, characterize, the, equilibrium, state, of, a, substance, an, example, is, the, gibbs, free, energy, g, p, t, displaystyle, g, p, t, which, is, a, function, of, pressure, and, temperature, knowing, any, one, thermodynamic, potential, f, displaystyle, mathcal, f, is, sufficient, to, compute, all, equilibrium, properties, of, a, substance, often, simply, by, taking, derivatives, of, f, displaystyle, mathcal, f, thus, a, single, correlation, for, f, displaystyle, mathcal, f, can, replace, separate, correlations, for, individual, properties, conversely, a, variety, of, experimental, measurements, e, g, density, heat, capacity, vapor, pressure, can, be, incorporated, into, the, same, fit, in, principle, this, would, allow, one, to, predict, hard, to, measure, properties, like, heat, capacity, in, terms, of, other, more, readily, available, measurements, e, g, vapor, pressure, hydrodynamic, theories, describe, liquids, in, terms, of, space, and, time, dependent, macroscopic, fields, such, as, density, velocity, and, temperature, these, fields, obey, partial, differential, equations, which, can, be, linear, or, nonlinear, hydrodynamic, theories, are, more, general, than, equilibrium, thermodynamic, descriptions, which, assume, that, liquids, are, approximately, homogeneous, and, time, independent, the, navier, stokes, equations, are, a, well, known, example, they, are, partial, differential, equations, giving, the, time, evolution, of, density, velocity, and, temperature, of, a, viscous, fluid, there, are, numerous, methods, for, numerically, solving, the, navier, stokes, equations, and, its, variants, mesoscopic, methods, operate, on, length, and, time, scales, between, the, particle, and, continuum, levels, for, this, reason, they, combine, elements, of, particle, based, dynamics, and, continuum, hydrodynamics, an, example, is, the, lattice, boltzmann, method, which, models, a, fluid, as, a, collection, of, fictitious, particles, that, exist, on, a, lattice, the, particles, evolve, in, time, through, streaming, straight, line, motion, and, collisions, conceptually, it, is, based, on, the, boltzmann, equation, for, dilute, gases, where, the, dynamics, of, a, molecule, consists, of, free, motion, interrupted, by, discrete, binary, collisions, but, it, is, also, applied, to, liquids, despite, the, analogy, with, individual, molecular, trajectories, it, is, a, coarse, grained, description, that, typically, operates, on, length, and, time, scales, larger, than, those, of, true, molecular, dynamics, hence, the, notion, of, fictitious, particles, other, methods, that, combine, elements, of, continuum, and, particle, level, dynamics, include, smoothed, particle, hydrodynamics, dissipative, particle, dynamics, and, multiparticle, collision, dynamics, microscopic, simulation, methods, work, directly, with, the, equations, of, motion, classical, or, quantum, of, the, constituent, molecules, classical, molecular, dynamics, md, simulates, liquids, using, newton, s, law, of, motion, from, newton, s, second, law, f, m, x, displaystyle, f, m, ddot, x, the, trajectories, of, molecules, can, be, traced, out, explicitly, and, used, to, compute, macroscopic, liquid, properties, like, density, or, viscosity, however, classical, md, requires, expressions, for, the, intermolecular, forces, f, in, newton, s, second, law, usually, these, must, be, approximated, using, experimental, data, or, some, other, input, ab, initio, quantum, mechanical, methods, simulate, liquids, using, only, the, laws, of, quantum, mechanics, and, fundamental, atomic, constants, in, contrast, with, classical, molecular, dynamics, the, intermolecular, force, fields, are, an, output, of, the, calculation, rather, than, an, input, based, on, experimental, measurements, or, other, considerations, in, principle, ab, initio, methods, can, simulate, the, properties, of, a, given, liquid, without, any, prior, experimental, data, however, they, are, very, expensive, computationally, especially, for, large, molecules, with, internal, structure
