the, uncertainty, principle, also, known, as, heisenberg, s, indeterminacy, principle, is, a, fundamental, concept, in, quantum, mechanics, it, states, that, there, is, a, limit, to, the, precision, with, which, certain, pairs, of, physical, properties, such, as, position, and, momentum, can, be, simultaneously, known, in, other, words, the, more, accurately, one, property, is, measured, the, less, accurately, the, other, property, can, be, known, more, formally, the, uncertainty, principle, is, any, of, a, variety, of, mathematical, inequalities, asserting, a, fundamental, limit, to, the, product, of, the, accuracy, of, certain, related, pairs, of, measurements, on, a, quantum, system, such, as, position, x, and, momentum, p, such, paired, variables, are, known, as, complementary, variables, or, canonically, conjugate, variables, first, introduced, in, 1927, by, german, physicist, werner, heisenberg, the, formal, inequality, relating, the, standard, deviation, of, position, x, and, the, standard, deviation, of, momentum, p, was, derived, by, earle, hesse, kennard, later, that, year, and, by, hermann, weyl, in, 1928, x, p, 2, displaystyle, sigma, x, sigma, p, geq, frac, hbar, 2, where, h, 2, displaystyle, hbar, frac, h, 2, pi, is, the, reduced, planck, constant, the, quintessentially, quantum, mechanical, uncertainty, principle, comes, in, many, forms, other, than, position, momentum, the, energy, time, relationship, is, widely, used, to, relate, quantum, state, lifetime, to, measured, energy, widths, but, its, formal, derivation, is, fraught, with, confusing, issues, about, the, nature, of, time, the, basic, principle, has, been, extended, in, numerous, directions, it, must, be, considered, in, many, kinds, of, fundamental, physical, measurements, it, is, vital, to, illustrate, how, the, principle, applies, to, relatively, intelligible, physical, situations, since, it, is, indiscernible, on, the, macroscopic, scales, that, humans, experience, two, alternative, frameworks, for, quantum, physics, offer, different, explanations, for, the, uncertainty, principle, the, wave, mechanics, picture, of, the, uncertainty, principle, is, more, visually, intuitive, but, the, more, abstract, matrix, mechanics, picture, formulates, it, in, a, way, that, generalizes, more, easily, mathematically, in, wave, mechanics, the, uncertainty, relation, between, position, and, momentum, arises, because, the, expressions, of, the, wavefunction, in, the, two, corresponding, orthonormal, bases, in, hilbert, space, are, fourier, transforms, of, one, another, i, e, position, and, momentum, are, conjugate, variables, a, nonzero, function, and, its, fourier, transform, cannot, both, be, sharply, localized, at, the, same, time, a, similar, tradeoff, between, the, variances, of, fourier, conjugates, arises, in, all, systems, underlain, by, fourier, analysis, for, example, in, sound, waves, a, pure, tone, is, a, sharp, spike, at, a, single, frequency, while, its, fourier, transform, gives, the, shape, of, the, sound, wave, in, the, time, domain, which, is, a, completely, delocalized, sine, wave, in, quantum, mechanics, the, two, key, points, are, that, the, position, of, the, particle, takes, the, form, of, a, matter, wave, and, momentum, is, its, fourier, conjugate, assured, by, the, de, broglie, relation, p, k, where, k, is, the, wavenumber, in, matrix, mechanics, the, mathematical, formulation, of, quantum, mechanics, any, pair, of, non, commuting, self, adjoint, operators, representing, observables, are, subject, to, similar, uncertainty, limits, an, eigenstate, of, an, observable, represents, the, state, of, the, wavefunction, for, a, certain, measurement, value, the, eigenvalue, for, example, if, a, measurement, of, an, observable, a, is, performed, then, the, system, is, in, a, particular, eigenstate, of, that, observable, however, the, particular, eigenstate, of, the, observable, a, need, not, be, an, eigenstate, of, another, observable, b, if, so, then, it, does, not, have, a, unique, associated, measurement, for, it, as, the, system, is, not, in, an, eigenstate, of, that, observable, the, uncertainty, principle, can, be, visualized, using, the, position, and, momentum, space, wavefunctions, for, one, spinless, particle, with, mass, in, one, dimension, the, more, localized, the, position, space, wavefunction, the, more, likely, the, particle, is, to, be, found, with, the, position, coordinates, in, that, region, and, correspondingly, the, momentum, space, wavefunction, is, less, localized, so, the, possible, momentum, components, the, particle, could, have, are, more, widespread, conversely, the, more, localized, the, momentum, space, wavefunction, the, more, likely, the, particle, is, to, be, found, with, those, values, of, momentum, components, in, that, region, and, correspondingly, the, less, localized, the, position, space, wavefunction, so, the, position, coordinates, the, particle, could, occupy, are, more, widespread, these, wavefunctions, are, fourier, transforms, of, each, other, mathematically, the, uncertainty, principle, expresses, the, relationship, between, conjugate, variables, in, the, transform, according, to, the, de, broglie, hypothesis, every, object, in, the, universe, is, associated, with, a, wave, thus, every, object, from, an, elementary, particle, to, atoms, molecules, and, on, up, to, planets, and, beyond, are, subject, to, the, uncertainty, principle, the, time, independent, wave, function, of, a, single, moded, plane, wave, of, wavenumber, k, 0, or, momentum, p, 0, is, x, e, i, k, 0, x, e, i, p, 0, x, displaystyle, psi, x, propto, e, ik, 0, x, e, ip, 0, x, hbar, the, born, rule, states, that, this, should, be, interpreted, as, a, probability, density, amplitude, function, in, the, sense, that, the, probability, of, finding, the, particle, between, a, and, b, is, p, a, x, b, a, b, x, 2, d, x, displaystyle, operatorname, p, int, a, b, psi, x, 2, mathrm, d, x, in, the, case, of, the, single, mode, plane, wave, x, 2, displaystyle, psi, x, 2, is, 1, if, x, x, displaystyle, x, x, and, 0, otherwise, in, other, words, the, particle, position, is, extremely, uncertain, in, the, sense, that, it, could, be, essentially, anywhere, along, the, wave, packet, on, the, other, hand, consider, a, wave, function, that, is, a, sum, of, many, waves, which, we, may, write, as, x, n, a, n, e, i, p, n, x, displaystyle, psi, x, propto, sum, n, a, n, e, ip, n, x, hbar, where, a, n, represents, the, relative, contribution, of, the, mode, p, n, to, the, overall, total, the, figures, to, the, right, show, how, with, the, addition, of, many, plane, waves, the, wave, packet, can, become, more, localized, we, may, take, this, a, step, further, to, the, continuum, limit, where, the, wave, function, is, an, integral, over, all, possible, modes, x, 1, 2, p, e, i, p, x, d, p, displaystyle, psi, x, frac, 1, sqrt, 2, pi, hbar, int, infty, infty, varphi, p, cdot, e, ipx, hbar, dp, with, p, displaystyle, varphi, p, representing, the, amplitude, of, these, modes, and, is, called, the, wave, function, in, momentum, space, in, mathematical, terms, we, say, that, p, displaystyle, varphi, p, is, the, fourier, transform, of, x, displaystyle, psi, x, and, that, x, and, p, are, conjugate, variables, adding, together, all, of, these, plane, waves, comes, at, a, cost, namely, the, momentum, has, become, less, precise, having, become, a, mixture, of, waves, of, many, different, momenta, one, way, to, quantify, the, precision, of, the, position, and, momentum, is, the, standard, deviation, since, x, 2, displaystyle, psi, x, 2, is, a, probability, density, function, for, position, we, calculate, its, standard, deviation, the, precision, of, the, position, is, improved, i, e, reduced, x, by, using, many, plane, waves, thereby, weakening, the, precision, of, the, momentum, i, e, increased, p, another, way, of, stating, this, is, that, x, and, p, have, an, inverse, relationship, or, are, at, least, bounded, from, below, this, is, the, uncertainty, principle, the, exact, limit, of, which, is, the, kennard, bound, we, are, interested, in, the, variances, of, position, and, momentum, defined, as, x, 2, x, 2, x, 2, d, x, x, x, 2, d, x, 2, displaystyle, sigma, x, 2, int, infty, infty, x, 2, cdot, psi, x, 2, dx, left,

general, proof, that, does, not, make, this, assumption, is, given, below, this, gives, us, the, simpler, form, x, 2, x, 2, x, 2, d, x, displaystyle, sigma, x, 2, int, infty, infty, x, 2, cdot, psi,

a, vector, in, a, function, space, we, can, define, an, inner, product, for, a, pair, of, functions, u, x, and, v, x, in, this, vector, space, u, v, u, x, v, x, d, x, displaystyle, langle, u, mid, v,

displaystyle, psi, x, and, p, displaystyle, varphi, p, are, wave, functions, for, position, and, momentum, which, are, fourier, transforms, of, each, other, a, similar, result, would, hold, for, any, pair, of, conjugate, variables, ref, in, matrix, mechanics, observables, such, as, position, and, momentum, are, represented, by, self, adjoint, operators, when, considering, pairs, of, observables, an, important, quantity, is, the, commutator, for, a, pair, of, operators, and, b, displaystyle, hat, b, one, defines, their, commutator, as, a, b, a, b, b, a, displaystyle, hat, a, hat, b, hat, b, hat, a, in, the, case, of, position, and, momentum, the, commutator, is, the, canonical, commutation, relation, x, p, i, displaystyle, i, hbar, the, physical, meaning, of, the, non, commutativity, can, be, understood, by, considering, the, effect, of, the, commutator, on, position, and, momentum, eigenstates, let, displaystyle, psi, rangle, be, a, right, eigenstate, of, position, with, a,

suppose, for, the, sake, of, proof, by, contradiction, that, displaystyle, psi, rangle, is, also, a, right, eigenstate, of, momentum, with, constant, eigenvalue, p, 0, if, this, were, true, then, one, could, write, x, x, 0, i, p, x, x, 0, i, p, 0, x, 0, i, x, 0, i, p, 0, 0, displaystyle, hat, x, x, 0, hat, i, hat, p, psi, rangle, hat, x, x, 0, hat, i, p, 0, psi, rangle, x, 0, hat, i, x, 0, hat, i,

quantum, state, can, simultaneously, be, both, a, position, and, a, momentum, eigenstate, when, a, state, is, measured, it, is, projected, onto, an, eigenstate, in, the, basis, of, the, relevant, observable, for, example, if, a, particle, s, position, is, measured, then, the, state, amounts, to, a, position, eigenstate, this, means, that, the, state, is, not, a, momentum, eigenstate, however, but, rather, it, can, be, represented, as, a, sum, of, multiple, momentum, basis, eigenstates, in, other, words, the, momentum, must, be, less, precise, this, precision, may, be, quantified, by, the,

exists, for, a, short, time, cannot, have, a, definite, energy, to, have, a, definite, energy, the, frequency, of, the, state, must, be, defined, accurately, and, this, requires, the, state, to, hang, around, for, many, cycles, the, reciprocal, of, the, required, accuracy, for, example, in, spectroscopy, excited, states, have, a, finite, lifetime, by, the, time, energy, uncertainty, principle, they, do, not, have, a, definite, energy, and, each, time, they, decay, the, energy, they, release, is, slightly, different, the, average, energy, of, the, outgoing, photon, has, a, peak, at, the,

have, a, narrow, linewidth, the, same, linewidth, effect, also, makes, it, difficult, to, specify, the, rest, mass, of, unstable, fast, decaying, particles, in, particle, physics, the, faster, the,

have, shown, that, in, some, quantum, systems, energy, can, be, measured, accurately, within, an, arbitrarily, short, time, external, time, uncertainty, principles, are, not, universal, intrinsic,

an, intrinsic, time, closely, matching, the, external, laboratory, time, is, called, a, clock, 31, observable, time, measuring, time, between, two, events, remains, a, challenge, for, quantum, theories, some, progress, has, been, made, using, positive, operator, valued, measure, concepts, in, 1945, leonid, mandelstam, and, igor, tamm, derived, a, non, relativistic, time, energy, uncertainty, relation, as, follows, from, heisenberg, mechanics, the, generalized, ehrenfest, theorem, for, an, observable, b, without, explicit, time, dependence, represented, by, a, self, adjoint, operator, b, displaystyle, hat, b, relates, time, dependence, of, the, average, value, of, b, displaystyle, hat, b, to, the, average, of, its, commutator, with, the, hamiltonian, d, b, d, t, i, h, b, displaystyle, frac, d, langle, hat, b, rangle, dt, frac, i, hbar, langle, rangle, the, value, of, h, b, displaystyle, langle, rangle, is, then, substituted, in, the, robertson, uncertainty, relation,

result, it, depends, upon, the, observable, chosen, and, that, the, deviations, h, displaystyle, sigma, h, and, b, displaystyle, sigma, b, are, computed, for, a, particular, state, identifying, e, e,

energy, time, relationship, e, b, 2, displaystyle, delta, e, tau, b, geq, frac, hbar, 2, although, b, displaystyle, tau, b, has, the, dimension, of, time, it, is, different, from, the, time, parameter, t, that, enters, the, schr, dinger, equation, this, b, displaystyle, tau, b, can, be, interpreted, as, time, for, which, the, expectation, value, of, the, observable, b, displaystyle, langle, hat, b, rangle, changes, by, an, amount, equal, to, one, standard, deviation, examples, each, example, has, a, different, meaning, for, the, time, uncertainty, according, to, the, observable, and, state, used, some, formulations, of, quantum, field, theory, uses, temporary, electron, positron, pairs, in, its, calculations, called, virtual, particles, the, mass, energy, and, lifetime, of, these, particles, are, related, by, the, energy, time, uncertainty, relation, the, energy, of, a, quantum, systems, is, not, known, with, enough, precision, to, limit, their, behavior, to, a, single, simple, history, thus, the, influence, of, all, histories, must, be, incorporated, into, quantum, calculations, including, those, with, much, greater, or, much, less, energy, than, the, mean, of, the, measured, calculated, energy, distribution, the, energy, time, uncertainty, principle, does, not, temporarily, violate, conservation, of, energy, it, does, not, imply, that, energy, can, be, borrowed, from, the, universe, as, long, as, it, is, returned, within, a, short, amount, of, time, 145, the, energy, of, the, universe, is, not, an, exactly, known, parameter, at, all, times, when, events, transpire, at, very, short, time, intervals, there, is, uncertainty, in, the, energy, of, these, events, historically, the, uncertainty, principle, has, been, confused, with, a, related, effect, in, physics, called, the, observer, effect, which, notes, that, measurements, of, certain, systems, cannot, be, made, without, affecting, the, system, that, is, without, changing, something, in, a, system, heisenberg, used, such, an, observer, effect, at, the, quantum, level, see, below, as, a, physical, explanation, of, quantum, uncertainty, it, has, since, become, clearer, however, that, the, uncertainty, principle, is, inherent, in, the, properties, of, all, wave, like, systems, and, that, it, arises, in, quantum, mechanics, simply, due, to, the, matter, wave, nature, of, all, quantum, objects, thus, the, uncertainty, principle, actually, states, a, fundamental, property, of, quantum, systems, and, is, not, a, statement, about, the, observational, success, of, current, technology, starting, with, kennard, s, derivation, of, position, momentum, uncertainty, howard, percy, robertson, developed, a, formulation, for, arbitrary, hermitian, operator, operators, o, displaystyle, hat,

a, hat, b, hat, a, hat, b, hat, b, hat, a, is, used, the, derivation, shown, here, incorporates, and, builds, off, of, those, shown, in, robertson, schr, dinger, and, standard, textbooks, such, as, griffiths, 138, for, any, hermitian, operator, a, displaystyle, hat, a, based, upon, the, definition, of, variance, we, have, a, 2, a, a, a, a, displaystyle, sigma, a, 2, langle, hat, a, langle, hat,

two, deviations, can, thus, be, expressed, as, in, order, to, relate, the, two, vectors, f, displaystyle, f, rangle, and, g, displaystyle, g, rangle, we, use, the, cauchy, schwarz, inequality, which, is, defined, as, f, f, g, g, f, g, 2, displaystyle, langle, f, mid, f, rangle, langle, g, mid, g, rangle, geq, langle, f, mid, g, rangle, 2, and, thus, equation, 1, can, be, written, as, since, f, g, displaystyle, langle, f, mid, g, rangle, is, in, general, a, complex, number, we, use, the, fact, that, the, modulus, squared, of, any, complex, number, z, displaystyle, z, is, defined, as, z, 2, z, z, displaystyle, z, 2, zz, where, z, displaystyle, z, is, the, complex, conjugate, of, z, displaystyle, z, the, modulus, squared, can, also, be, expressed, as, we, let, z, f, g, displaystyle, z, langle, f, mid, g, rangle, and, z, g, f, displaystyle, z, langle, g, mid, f, rangle, and, substitute, these, into, the, equation, above, to, get, the, inner, product, f, g, displaystyle, langle, f, mid, g, rangle, is, written, out, explicitly, as, f, g, a, a, b, b, displaystyle, langle, f, mid, g, rangle, langle, hat, a, langle, hat, a, rangle, psi, hat, b, langle, hat, b, rangle, psi, rangle, and, using, the, fact, that, a, displaystyle, hat, a, and, b, displaystyle, hat, b, are, hermitian, operators, we, find, f, g, a, a, b, b, a, b, a, b, b, a, a, b, a, b, a, b, b, a, a, b, a, b, a, b,

rangle, langle, hat, b, rangle, langle, hat, a, hat, b, rangle, 2, langle, hat, a, rangle, langle, hat, b, rangle, we, now, substitute, the, above, two, equations, above, back, into, eq, 4, and, get,

issue, related, to, the, domains, of, the, operators, involved, for, the, proof, to, make, sense, the, vector, b, displaystyle, hat, b, psi, rangle, has, to, be, in, the, domain, of, the, unbounded, operator, a, displaystyle, hat, a, which, is, not, always, the, case, in, fact, the, robertson, uncertainty, relation, is, false, if, a, displaystyle, hat, a, is, an, angle, variable, and, b, displaystyle, hat, b, is, the, derivative, with, respect, to, this, variable, in, this, example, the, commutator, is, a, nonzero, constant, just, as, in, the, heisenberg, uncertainty, relation, and, yet, there, are, states, where, the, product, of, the, uncertainties, is, zero, see, the, counterexample, section, below, this, issue, can, be, overcome, by, using, a, variational, method, for, the, proof, or, by, working, with, an, exponentiated, version, of, the, canonical, commutation, relations, note, that, in, the, general, form, of, the, robertson, schr, dinger, uncertainty, relation, there, is, no, need, to, assume, that, the, operators, a, displaystyle, hat, a, and, b, displaystyle, hat, b, are, self, adjoint, operators, it, suffices, to, assume, that, they, are, merely, symmetric, operators, the, distinction, between, these, two, notions, is, generally, glossed, over, in, the, physics, literature, where, the, term, hermitian, is, used, for, either, or, both, classes, of, operators, see, chapter, 9, of, hall, s, book, for, a, detailed, discussion, of, this, important, but, technical, distinction, the, robertson, schr, dinger, uncertainty, relation, may, be,

be, trivial, if, the, state, of, the, system, is, chosen, to, be, eigenstate, of, one, of, the, observable, the, stronger, uncertainty, relations, proved, by, lorenzo, maccone, and, arun, k, pati,

displaystyle, psi, rangle, the, form, of, a, b, displaystyle, bar, psi, a, b, rangle, implies, that, the, right, hand, side, of, the, new, uncertainty, relation, is, nonzero, unless, displaystyle, psi, rangle, is, an, eigenstate, of, a, b, displaystyle, a, b, one, may, note, that, displaystyle, psi, rangle, can, be, an, eigenstate, of, a, b, displaystyle, a, b, without, being, an, eigenstate, of, either, a, displaystyle, a, or, b, displaystyle, b, however, when, displaystyle, psi, rangle, is, an, eigenstate, of, one, of, the, two, observables, the, heisenberg, schr, dinger, uncertainty, relation, becomes, trivial, but, the, lower, bound, in, the, new, relation, is, nonzero, unless, displaystyle, psi, rangle, is, an, eigenstate, of, both, the, robertson, schr, dinger, uncertainty, can, be, improved, noting, that, it, must, hold, for, all, components, k, displaystyle, varrho, k, in, any, decomposition, of, the, density, matrix, given, as, k, p, k, k, displaystyle, varrho, sum,

bound, larger, than, that, of, the, original, robertson, schr, dinger, uncertainty, relation, thus, we, need, to, calculate, the, bound, of, the, robertson, schr, dinger, uncertainty, for, the, mixed, components, of, the, quantum, state, rather, than, for, the, quantum, state, and, compute, an, average, of, their, square, roots, the, following, expression, is, stronger, than, the, robertson, schr,

robertson, inequality, for, operators, a, displaystyle, hat, a, and, b, displaystyle, hat, b, requires, a, b, displaystyle, hat, a, hat, b, psi, and, b, a, displaystyle, hat, b, hat, a, psi, to, be, defined, there, are, quantum, systems, where, these, conditions, are, not, valid, one, example, is, a, quantum, particle, on, a, ring, where, the, wave, function, depends, on, an, angular, variable, displaystyle, theta, in, the, interval, 0, 2, displaystyle, define, position, and, momentum, operators, a, displaystyle, hat, a, and, b, displaystyle, hat, b, by, a, 0, 2, displaystyle, hat, a, psi,

definition, of, a, displaystyle, hat, a, depends, the, displaystyle, theta, range, from, 0, to, 2, displaystyle, 2, pi, these, operators, satisfy, the, usual, commutation, relations, for, position, and, momentum, operators, a, b, i, displaystyle, i, hbar, more, precisely, a, b, b, a, i, displaystyle, hat, a, hat, b, psi, hat, b, hat, a, psi, i, hbar, psi, whenever, both, a, b, displaystyle, hat, a, hat, b, psi, and, b, a, displaystyle, hat, b, hat, a, psi, are, defined, and, the, space, of, such, displaystyle, psi, is, a, dense, subspace, of, the, quantum, hilbert, space, now, let, displaystyle, psi, be, any, of, the, eigenstates, of, b, displaystyle, hat, b, which, are, given, by, e, 2, i, n, displaystyle, psi, theta, e, 2, pi, in, theta, these, states, are, normalizable, unlike, the, eigenstates, of, the, momentum, operator, on, the, line, also, the, operator, a, displaystyle, hat, a, is, bounded, since, displaystyle, theta, ranges, over, a, bounded, interval, thus, in, the, state, displaystyle, psi, the, uncertainty, of, b, displaystyle, b, is, zero, and, the, uncertainty, of, a, displaystyle, a, is, finite, so, that, a, b, 0, displaystyle, sigma, a, sigma, b, 0, the, robertson, uncertainty, principle, does, not, apply, in, this, case, displaystyle, psi, is, not, in, the, domain, of, the, operator, b, a, displaystyle, hat, b, hat, a, since, multiplication,

displaystyle, hat, p, on, the, real, line, no, such, counterexamples, can, occur, as, long, as, x, displaystyle, sigma, x, and, p, displaystyle, sigma, p, are, defined, in, the, state, displaystyle, psi, the, heisenberg, uncertainty, principle, holds, even, if, displaystyle, psi, fails, to, be, in, the, domain, of, x, p, displaystyle, hat, x, hat, p, or, of, p, x, displaystyle, hat, p, hat, x, in, quantum, metrology, and, especially, interferometry, the, heisenberg, limit, is, the, optimal, rate, at, which, the, accuracy, of, a, measurement, can, scale, with, the, energy, used, in, the, measurement, typically, this, is, the, measurement, of, a, phase, applied, to, one, arm, of, a, beam, splitter, and, the, energy, is, given, by, the, number, of, photons, used, in, an, interferometer, although, some, claim, to, have, broken, the, heisenberg, limit, this, reflects, disagreement, on, the, definition, of, the, scaling, resource, suitably, defined, the, heisenberg, limit, is, a, consequence, of, the, basic, principles, of, quantum, mechanics, and, cannot, be, beaten, although, the, weak, heisenberg, limit, can, be, beaten, the, inequalities, above, focus, on, the, statistical, imprecision, of, observables, as, quantified, by, the, standard, deviation, displaystyle, sigma, heisenberg, s, original, version, however, was, dealing, with, the, systematic, error, a,

first, term, of, ozawa, inequality, regarding, the, systematic, error, using, the, notation, above, to, describe, the, error, disturbance, effect, of, sequential, measurements, first, a, then, b, it, could, be, written, as, a, b, 1, 2, a, b, displaystyle, varepsilon, a, eta, b, geq, frac, 1, 2, left, bigl, langle, bigl, bigr, rangle, right, the, formal, derivation, of, the, heisenberg, relation, is, possible, but, far, from, intuitive, it, was, not, proposed, by, heisenberg, but, formulated, in, a, mathematically, consistent, way, only, in, recent, years, also, it, must, be, stressed, that, the, heisenberg, formulation, is, not, taking, into, account, the, intrinsic, statistical, errors, a, displaystyle, sigma, a, and, b, displaystyle, sigma, b, there, is, increasing, experimental, evidence, that, the, total, quantum, uncertainty, cannot, be, described, by, the, heisenberg, term, alone, but, requires, the, presence, of, all, the, three, terms, of, the, ozawa, inequality, using, the, same, formalism, it, is, also, possible, to, introduce, the, other, kind, of, physical, situation, often, confused, with, the, previous, one, namely, the, case, of, simultaneous, measurements, a, and, b, at, the, same, time, a, b, 1, 2, a, b, displaystyle, varepsilon, a, varepsilon, b, geq, frac, 1, 2, left, bigl, langle, bigl, bigr, rangle, right, the, two, simultaneous, measurements, on, a, and, b, are, necessarily, unsharp, or, weak, it, is, also, possible, to, derive, an, uncertainty, relation, that, as, the, ozawa, s, one, combines, both, the, statistical, and, systematic, error, components, but, keeps, a, form, very, close, to, the, heisenberg, original, inequality, by, adding, robertson, a, b, 1, 2, a, b, displaystyle, sigma, a, sigma, b, geq, frac, 1, 2, left, bigl, langle, bigl, bigr, rangle, right, and, ozawa, relations, we, obtain, a, b, a, b, a, b, a, b, a, b, displaystyle, varepsilon, a, eta, b, varepsilon, a, sigma, b, sigma, a, eta, b, sigma, a, sigma, b, geq, left, bigl, langle, bigl, bigr, rangle, right, the, four, terms, can, be, written, as, a, a, b, b, a, b, displaystyle, varepsilon, a, sigma, a, eta, b, sigma, b, geq, left, bigl, langle, bigl, bigr, rangle, right, defining, a, a, a, displaystyle, bar, varepsilon, a, equiv, varepsilon, a, sigma, a, as, the, inaccuracy, in, the, measured, values, of, the, variable, a, and, b, b, b, displaystyle,

one, but, valid, both, for, systematic, and, statistical, errors, a, b, a, b, displaystyle, bar, varepsilon, a, bar, eta, b, geq, left, bigl, langle, bigl, bigr, rangle, right, for, many, distributions, the, standard, deviation, is, not, a, particularly, natural, way, of, quantifying, the, structure, for, example, uncertainty, relations, in, which, one, of, the, observables, is, an, angle, has, little, physical, meaning, for, fluctuations, larger, than, one, period, other, examples, include, highly, bimodal, distributions, or, unimodal, distributions, with, divergent, variance, a, solution, that, overcomes, these, issues, is, an, uncertainty, based, on, entropic, uncertainty, instead, of, the, product, of, variances, while, formulating, the, many, worlds, interpretation, of, quantum, mechanics, in, 1957, hugh, everett, iii, conjectured, a, stronger, extension, of, the, uncertainty, principle, based, on, entropic, certainty, this, conjecture, also, studied, by, i, i, hirschman, and, proven, in, 1975, by, w, beckner, and, by, iwo, bialynicki, birula, and, jerzy, mycielski, is, that, for, two, normalized, dimensionless, fourier, transform, pairs, f, a, and, g, b,

to, be, h, then, h, x, h, p, log, e, 2, displaystyle, h, x, h, p, geq, log, left, frac, e, 2, right, if, instead, x, 0, p, 0, is, chosen, to, be, then, h, x, h, p, log, e, displaystyle, h, x, h, p, geq, log, e, pi, if, x, 0, and, p, 0, are, chosen, to, be, unity, in, whatever, system, of, units, are, being, used, then, h, x, h, p, log, e, h, 2, displaystyle, h, x, h, p, geq, log, left, frac, e,

extended, to, multimode, quantum, states, or, wavefunctions, in, more, than, one, spatial, dimension, the, quantum, entropic, uncertainty, principle, is, more, restrictive, than, the, heisenberg,

with, a, given, variance, it, readily, follows, that, this, entropic, uncertainty, principle, is, stronger, than, the, one, based, on, standard, deviations, because, x, p, 2, exp, h, x, h, p, log, e,

heisenberg, uncertainty, principle, is, a, consequence, of, the, quantum, entropic, uncertainty, principle, but, not, vice, versa, a, few, remarks, on, these, inequalities, first, the, choice, of, base, e, is, a, matter, of, popular, convention, in, physics, the, logarithm, can, alternatively, be, in, any, base, provided, that, it, be, consistent, on, both, sides, of, the, inequality, second, recall, the, shannon, entropy, has, been, used, not, the, quantum, von, neumann, entropy, finally, the, normal, distribution, saturates, the, inequality, and, it, is, the, only, distribution, with,

version, of, heisenberg, s, textbook, the, physical, principles, of, the, quantum, theory, was, published, in, 1930, however, only, the, english, word, uncertainty, was, used, and, it, became, the, term, in, the, english, language, the, principle, is, quite, counter, intuitive, so, the, early, students, of, quantum, theory, had, to, be, reassured, that, naive, measurements, to, violate, it, were, bound, always, to, be, unworkable, one, way, in, which, heisenberg, originally, illustrated, the, intrinsic, impossibility, of, violating, the, uncertainty, principle, is, by, using, the, observer, effect, of, an, imaginary, microscope, as, a, measuring, device, he, imagines, an, experimenter, trying, to, measure, the, position, and, momentum, of, an, electron, by, shooting, a, photon, at, it, 49, 50, the, combination, of, these, trade, offs, implies, that, no, matter, what, photon, wavelength, and, aperture, size, are, used, the, product, of, the, uncertainty, in, measured, position, and, measured, momentum, is, greater, than, or, equal, to, a, lower, limit, which, is, up, to, a, small, numerical, factor, equal, to, the, planck, constant, heisenberg, did, not, care, to,

the, radically, new, noncommutativity, of, quantum, mechanics, inevitable, the, copenhagen, interpretation, of, quantum, mechanics, and, heisenberg, s, uncertainty, principle, were, in, fact, initially, seen, as, twin, targets, by, detractors, according, to, the, copenhagen, interpretation, of, quantum, mechanics, there, is, no, fundamental, reality, that, the, quantum, state, describes, just, a, prescription, for, calculating, experimental, results, there, is, no, way, to, say, what, the, state, of, a, system, fundamentally, is, only, what, the, result, of, observations, might, be, albert, einstein, believed, that, randomness, is, a, reflection, of, our, ignorance, of, some, fundamental, property, of, reality, while, niels, bohr, believed, that, the, probability, distributions, are, fundamental, and, irreducible, and, depend, on, which, measurements, we, choose, to, perform, einstein, and, bohr, debated, the, uncertainty, principle, for, many, years, wolfgang, pauli, called, einstein, s, fundamental, objection, to, the, uncertainty, principle, the, ideal, of, the, detached, observer, phrase, translated, from, the, german, like, the, moon, has, a, definite, position, einstein, said, to, me, last, winter, whether, or, not, we, look, at, the, moon, the, same, must, also, hold, for, the, atomic, objects, as, there, is, no, sharp, distinction, possible, between, these, and, macroscopic, objects, observation, cannot, create, an, element, of, reality, like, a, position, there, must, be, something, contained, in, the, complete, description, of, physical, reality, which, corresponds, to, the, possibility, of, observing, a, position, already, before, the, observation, has, been, actually, made, i, hope, that, i, quoted, einstein, correctly, it, is, always, difficult, to, quote, somebody, out, of, memory, with, whom, one, does, not, agree, it, is, precisely, this, kind, of, postulate, which, i, call, the, ideal, of, the, detached, observer, the, first, of, einstein, s, thought, experiments, challenging, the, uncertainty, principle, went, as, follows, consider, a, particle, passing, through, a, slit, of, width, d, the, slit, introduces, an, uncertainty, in, momentum, of, approximately, h, d, because, the, particle, passes, through, the, wall, but, let, us, determine, the, momentum, of, the, particle, by, measuring, the, recoil, of, the, wall, in, doing, so, we, find, the, momentum, of, the, particle, to, arbitrary, accuracy, by, conservation, of, momentum, bohr, s, response, was, that, the, wall, is, quantum, mechanical, as, well, and, that, to, measure, the, recoil, to, accuracy, p, the, momentum, of, the, wall, must, be, known, to, this, accuracy, before, the, particle, passes, through, this, introduces, an, uncertainty, in, the, position, of, the, wall, and, therefore, the, position, of, the, slit, equal, to, h, p, and, if, the, wall, s, momentum, is, known, precisely, enough, to, measure, the, recoil, the, slit, s, position, is, uncertain, enough, to, disallow, a, position, measurement, a, similar, analysis, with, particles, diffracting, through, multiple, slits, is, given, by, richard, feynman, bohr, was, present, when, einstein, proposed, the, thought, experiment, which, has, become, known, as, einstein, s, box, einstein, argued, that, heisenberg, s, uncertainty, equation, implied, that, the, uncertainty, in, time, was, related, to, the, uncertainty, in, energy, the, product, of, the, two, being, related, to, the, planck, constant, consider, he, said, an, ideal, box, lined, with, mirrors, so, that, it, can, contain, light, indefinitely, the, box, could, be, weighed, before, a, clockwork, mechanism, opened, an, ideal, shutter, at, a, chosen, instant, to, allow, one, single, photon, to, escape, we, now, know, explained, einstein, precisely, the, time, at, which, the, photon, left, the, box, now, weigh, the, box, again, the, change, of, mass, tells, the, energy, of, the, emitted, light, in, this, manner, said, einstein, one, could, measure, the, energy, emitted, and, the, time, it, was, released, with, any, desired, precision, in, contradiction, to, the, uncertainty, principle, bohr, spent, a, sleepless, night, considering, this, argument, and, eventually, realized, that, it, was, flawed, he, pointed, out, that, if, the, box, were, to, be, weighed, say, by, a, spring, and, a, pointer, on, a, scale, since, the, box, must, move, vertically, with, a, change, in, its, weight, there, will, be, uncertainty, in, its, vertical, velocity, and, therefore, an, uncertainty, in, its, height, above, the, table, furthermore, the, uncertainty, about, the, elevation, above, the, earth, s, surface, will, result, in, an, uncertainty, in, the, rate, of, the, clock, because, of, einstein, s, own, theory, of, gravity, s, effect, on, time, through, this, chain, of, uncertainties, bohr, showed, that, einstein, s, light, box, experiment, could, not, simultaneously, measure, exactly, both, the, energy, of, the, photon, and, the, time, of, its, escape, in, 1935, einstein, boris, podolsky, and, nathan, rosen, published, an, analysis, of, spatially, separated, entangled, particles, epr, paradox, according, to, epr, one, could, measure, the, position, of, one, of, the, entangled, particles, and, the, momentum, of, the, second, particle, and, from, those, measurements, deduce, the, position, and, momentum, of, both, particles, to, any, precision, violating, the, uncertainty, principle, in, order, to, avoid, such, possibility, the, measurement, of, one, particle, must, modify, the, probability, distribution, of, the, other, particle, instantaneously, possibly, violating, the, principle, of, locality, in, 1964, john, stewart, bell, showed, that, this, assumption, can, be, falsified, since, it, would, imply, a, certain, inequality, between, the, probabilities, of, different, experiments, experimental, results, confirm, the, predictions, of, quantum, mechanics, ruling, out, epr, s, basic, assumption, of, local, hidden, variables, science, philosopher, karl, popper, approached, the, problem, of, indeterminacy, as, a, logician, and, metaphysical, realist, he, disagreed, with, the, application, of, the, uncertainty, relations, to, individual, particles, rather, than, to, ensembles, of, identically, prepared, particles, referring, to, them, as, statistical, scatter, relations, in, this, statistical, interpretation, a, particular, measurement, may, be, made, to, arbitrary, precision, without, invalidating, the, quantum, theory, in, 1934, popper, published, zur, kritik, der, ungenauigkeitsrelationen, critique, of, the, uncertainty, relations, in, naturwissenschaften, and, in, the, same, year, logik, der, forschung, translated, and, updated, by, the, author, as, the, logic, of, scientific, discovery, in, 1959, outlining, his, arguments, for, the, statistical, interpretation, in, 1982, he, further, developed, his, theory, in, quantum, theory, and, the, schism, in, physics, writing, formulae, are, beyond, all, doubt, derivable, statistical, formulae, of, the, quantum, theory, but, they, have, been, habitually, misinterpreted, by, those, quantum, theorists, who, said, that, these, formulae, can, be, interpreted, as, determining, some, upper, limit, to, the, precision, of, our, measurements, popper, proposed, an, experiment, to, falsify, the, uncertainty, relations, although, he, later, withdrew, his, initial, version, after, discussions, with, carl, friedrich, von, weizs, cker, heisenberg, and, einstein, popper, sent, his, paper, to, einstein, and, it, may, have, influenced, the, formulation, of, the, epr, paradox, 720, some, scientists, including, arthur, compton, and, martin, heisenberg, have, suggested, that, the, uncertainty, principle, or, at, least, the, general, probabilistic, nature, of, quantum, mechanics, could, be, evidence, for, the, two, stage, model, of, free, will, one, critique, however, is, that, apart, from, the, basic, role, of, quantum, mechanics, as, a, foundation, for, chemistry, nontrivial, biological, mechanisms, requiring, quantum, mechanics, are, unlikely, due, to, the, rapid, decoherence, time, of, quantum, systems, at, room, temperature, proponents, of, this, theory, commonly, say, that, this, decoherence, is, overcome, by, both, screening, and, decoherence, free, subspaces, found, in, biological, cells, there, is, reason, to, believe, that, violating, the, uncertainty, principle, also, strongly, implies, the, violation, of, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, see, gibbs, paradox, uncertainty, principles, relate, quantum, particles, electrons, for, example, to, classical, concepts, position, and, momentum, this, presumes, quantum, particles, have, position, and, momentum, edwin, c, kemble, pointed, out, in, 1937, that, such, properties, cannot, be, experimentally, verified, and, assuming, they, exist, gives, rise, to, many, contradictions, similarly, rudolf, haag, notes, that, position, in, quantum, mechanics, is, an, attribute, of, an, interaction, say, between, an, electron, and, a, detector, not, an, intrinsic, property, from, this, point, of, view, the, uncertainty, principle, is, not, a, fundamental, quantum, property, but, a, concept, carried, over, from, the, language, of, our, ancestors, as, kemble, says, since, the, uncertainty, principle, is, such, a, basic, result, in, quantum, mechanics, typical, experiments, in, quantum, mechanics, routinely, observe, aspects, of, it, all, forms, of, spectroscopy, including, particle, physics, use, the, relationship, to, relate, measured, energy, line, width, to, the, lifetime, of, quantum, states, certain, experiments, however, may, deliberately, test, a, particular, form, of, the, uncertainty, principle, as, part, of, their, main, research, program, these, include, for, example, tests, of, number, phase, uncertainty, relations, in, superconducting, or, quantum, optics, systems, applications, dependent, on, the, uncertainty, principle, for, their, operation, include, extremely, low, noise, technology, such, as, that, required, in, gravitational, wave, interferometers
