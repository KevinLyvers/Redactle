50, g, l, ethanol, 4, g, l, acetonitrile, urea, also, called, carbamide, because, it, is, a, diamide, of, carbonic, acid, is, an, organic, compound, with, chemical, formula, co, nh, 2, 2, this, amide, has, two, amino, groups, nh, 2, joined, by, a, carbonyl, functional, group, c, o, it, is, thus, the, simplest, amide, of, carbamic, acid, urea, serves, an, important, role, in, the, cellular, metabolism, of, nitrogen, containing, compounds, by, animals, and, is, the, main, nitrogen, containing, substance, in, the, urine, of, mammals, urea, is, neo, latin, from, french, ur, e, from, ancient, greek, o, ron, urine, itself, from, proto, indo, european, h, worsom, it, is, a, colorless, odorless, solid, highly, soluble, in, water, and, practically, non, toxic, ld, 50, is, 15, g, kg, for, rats, dissolved, in, water, it, is, neither, acidic, nor, alkaline, the, body, uses, it, in, many, processes, most, notably, nitrogen, excretion, the, liver, forms, it, by, combining, two, ammonia, molecules, nh, 3, with, a, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, molecule, in, the, urea, cycle, urea, is, widely, used, in, fertilizers, as, a, source, of, nitrogen, n, and, is, an, important, raw, material, for, the, chemical, industry, in, 1828, friedrich, w, hler, discovered, that, urea, can, be, produced, from, inorganic, starting, materials, which, was, an, important, conceptual, milestone, in, chemistry, this, showed, for, the, first, time, that, a, substance, previously, known, only, as, a, byproduct, of, life, could, be, synthesized, in, the, laboratory, without, biological, starting, materials, thereby, contradicting, the, widely, held, doctrine, of, vitalism, which, stated, that, only, living, organisms, could, produce, the, chemicals, of, life, the, structure, of, the, molecule, of, urea, is, o, c, nh, 2, 2, the, urea, molecule, is, planar, when, in, a, solid, crystal, because, of, sp, 2, hybridization, of, the, n, orbitals, it, is, non, planar, with, c, 2, symmetry, when, in, the, gas, phase, or, in, aqueous, solution, with, c, n, h, and, h, n, h, bond, angles, that, are, intermediate, between, the, trigonal, planar, angle, of, 120, and, the, tetrahedral, angle, of, 109, 5, in, solid, urea, the, oxygen, center, is, engaged, in, two, n, h, o, hydrogen, bonds, the, resulting, dense, and, energetically, favourable, hydrogen, bond, network, is, probably, established, at, the, cost, of, efficient, molecular, packing, the, structure, is, quite, open, the, ribbons, forming, tunnels, with, square, cross, section, the, carbon, in, urea, is, described, as, sp, 2, hybridized, the, c, n, bonds, have, significant, double, bond, character, and, the, carbonyl, oxygen, is, relatively, basic, urea, s, high, aqueous, solubility, reflects, its, ability, to, engage, in, extensive, hydrogen, bonding, with, water, by, virtue, of, its, tendency, to, form, porous, frameworks, urea, has, the, ability, to, trap, many, organic, compounds, in, these, so, called, clathrates, the, organic, guest, molecules, are, held, in, channels, formed, by, interpenetrating, helices, composed, of, hydrogen, bonded, urea, molecules, as, the, helices, are, interconnected, all, helices, in, a, crystal, must, have, the, same, molecular, handedness, this, is, determined, when, the, crystal, is, nucleated, and, can, thus, be, forced, by, seeding, the, resulting, crystals, have, been, used, to, separate, racemic, mixtures, urea, is, a, weak, base, with, a, p, k, b, of, 13, 9, when, combined, with, strong, acids, it, undergoes, protonation, at, oxygen, to, form, uronium, salts, it, is, also, a, lewis, base, forming, metal, complexes, of, the, type, n, urea, reacts, with, malonic, esters, to, make, barbituric, acids, molten, urea, decomposes, into, ammonium, cyanate, at, about, 152, c, and, into, ammonia, and, isocyanic, acid, above, 160, c, heating, above, 160, c, yields, biuret, nh, 2, conhconh, 2, and, triuret, nh, 2, conhconhconh, 2, via, reaction, with, isocyanic, acid, at, higher, temperatures, it, converts, to, a, range, of, condensation, products, including, cyanuric, acid, cnoh, 3, guanidine, hnc, nh, 2, 2, and, melamine, in, aqueous, solution, urea, slowly, equilibrates, with, ammonium, cyanate, this, elimination, reaction, cogenerates, isocyanic, acid, which, can, carbamylate, proteins, in, particular, the, n, terminal, amino, group, the, side, chain, amino, of, lysine, and, to, a, lesser, extent, the, side, chains, of, arginine, and, cysteine, each, carbamylation, event, adds, 43, daltons, to, the, mass, of, the, protein, which, can, be, observed, in, protein, mass, spectrometery, for, this, reason, pure, urea, solutions, should, be, freshly, prepared, and, used, as, aged, solutions, may, develop, a, significant, concentration, of, cyanate, 20, mm, in, 8, m, urea, dissolving, urea, in, ultrapure, water, followed, by, removing, ions, i, e, cyanate, with, a, mixed, bed, ion, exchange, resin, and, storing, that, solution, at, 4, c, is, a, recommended, preparation, procedure, however, cyanate, will, build, back, up, to, significant, levels, within, a, few, days, alternatively, adding, 25, 50, mm, ammonium, chloride, to, a, concentrated, urea, solution, decreases, formation, of, cyanate, because, of, the, common, ion, effect, urea, is, readily, quantified, by, a, number, of, different, methods, such, as, the, diacetyl, monoxime, colorimetric, method, and, the, berthelot, reaction, after, initial, conversion, of, urea, to, ammonia, via, urease, these, methods, are, amenable, to, high, throughput, instrumentation, such, as, automated, flow, injection, analyzers, and, 96, well, micro, plate, spectrophotometers, ureas, describes, a, class, of, chemical, compounds, that, share, the, same, functional, group, a, carbonyl, group, attached, to, two, organic, amine, residues, r, 1, r, 2, n, c, o, nr, 3, r, 4, where, r, 1, r, 2, r, 3, and, r, 4, groups, are, hydrogen, h, organyl, or, other, groups, examples, include, carbamide, peroxide, allantoin, and, hydantoin, ureas, are, closely, related, to, biurets, and, related, in, structure, to, amides, carbamates, carbodiimides, and, thiocarbamides, more, than, 90, of, world, industrial, production, of, urea, is, destined, for, use, as, a, nitrogen, release, fertilizer, urea, has, the, highest, nitrogen, content, of, all, solid, nitrogenous, fertilizers, in, common, use, therefore, it, has, a, low, transportation, cost, per, unit, of, nitrogen, nutrient, the, most, common, impurity, of, synthetic, urea, is, biuret, which, impairs, plant, growth, urea, breaks, down, in, the, soil, to, give, ammonium, ions, nh, 4, the, ammonium, is, taken, up, by, the, plant, through, its, roots, in, some, soils, the, ammonium, is, oxidized, by, bacteria, to, give, nitrate, no, 3, which, is, also, a, nitrogen, rich, plant, nutrient, the, loss, of, nitrogenous, compounds, to, the, atmosphere, and, runoff, is, wasteful, and, environmentally, damaging, so, urea, is, sometimes, modified, to, enhance, the, efficiency, of, its, agricultural, use, techniques, to, make, controlled, release, fertilizers, that, slow, the, release, of, nitrogen, include, the, encapsulation, of, urea, in, an, inert, sealant, and, conversion, of, urea, into, derivatives, such, as, urea, formaldehyde, compounds, which, degrade, into, ammonia, at, a, pace, matching, plants, nutritional, requirements, urea, is, a, raw, material, for, the, manufacture, of, formaldehyde, based, resins, such, as, uf, muf, and, mupf, used, mainly, in, wood, based, panels, for, instance, particleboard, fiberboard, osb, and, plywood, urea, can, be, used, in, a, reaction, with, nitric, acid, to, make, urea, nitrate, a, high, explosive, that, is, used, industrially, and, as, part, of, some, improvised, explosive, devices, urea, is, used, in, selective, non, catalytic, reduction, sncr, and, selective, catalytic, reduction, scr, reactions, to, reduce, the, no, x, pollutants, in, exhaust, gases, from, combustion, from, diesel, dual, fuel, and, lean, burn, natural, gas, engines, the, bluetec, system, for, example, injects, a, water, based, urea, solution, into, the, exhaust, system, ammonia, nh, 3, produced, by, the, hydrolysis, of, urea, reacts, with, nitrogen, oxides, no, x, and, is, converted, into, nitrogen, gas, n, 2, and, water, within, the, catalytic, converter, the, conversion, of, noxious, no, x, to, innocuous, n, 2, is, described, by, the, following, simplified, global, equation, when, urea, is, used, a, pre, reaction, hydrolysis, occurs, to, first, convert, it, to, ammonia, being, a, solid, highly, soluble, in, water, 545, g, l, at, 25, c, urea, is, much, easier, and, safer, to, handle, and, store, than, the, more, irritant, caustic, and, hazardous, ammonia, nh, 3, so, it, is, the, reactant, of, choice, trucks, and, cars, using, these, catalytic, converters, need, to, carry, a, supply, of, diesel, exhaust, fluid, also, sold, as, adblue, a, solution, of, urea, in, water, urea, in, concentrations, up, to, 10, m, is, a, powerful, protein, denaturant, as, it, disrupts, the, noncovalent, bonds, in, the, proteins, this, property, can, be, exploited, to, increase, the, solubility, of, some, proteins, a, mixture, of, urea, and, choline, chloride, is, used, as, a, deep, eutectic, solvent, des, a, substance, similar, to, ionic, liquid, when, used, in, a, deep, eutectic, solvent, urea, gradually, denatures, the, proteins, that, are, solubilized, urea, can, in, principle, serve, as, a, hydrogen, source, for, subsequent, power, generation, in, fuel, cells, urea, present, in, urine, wastewater, can, be, used, directly, though, bacteria, normally, quickly, degrade, urea, producing, hydrogen, by, electrolysis, of, urea, solution, occurs, at, a, lower, voltage, 0, 37, v, and, thus, consumes, less, energy, than, the, electrolysis, of, water, 1, 2, v, urea, in, concentrations, up, to, 8, m, can, be, used, to, make, fixed, brain, tissue, transparent, to, visible, light, while, still, preserving, fluorescent, signals, from, labeled, cells, this, allows, for, much, deeper, imaging, of, neuronal, processes, than, previously, obtainable, using, conventional, one, photon, or, two, photon, confocal, microscopes, urea, containing, creams, are, used, as, topical, dermatological, products, to, promote, rehydration, of, the, skin, urea, 40, is, indicated, for, psoriasis, xerosis, onychomycosis, ichthyosis, eczema, keratosis, keratoderma, corns, and, calluses, if, covered, by, an, occlusive, dressing, 40, urea, preparations, may, also, be, used, for, nonsurgical, debridement, of, nails, urea, 40, dissolves, the, intercellular, matrix, of, the, nail, plate, only, diseased, or, dystrophic, nails, are, removed, as, there, is, no, effect, on, healthy, portions, of, the, nail, this, drug, as, carbamide, peroxide, is, also, used, as, an, earwax, removal, aid, urea, has, also, been, studied, as, a, diuretic, it, was, first, used, by, dr, w, friedrich, in, 1892, in, a, 2010, study, of, icu, patients, urea, was, used, to, treat, euvolemic, hyponatremia, and, was, found, safe, inexpensive, and, simple, like, saline, urea, has, been, injected, into, the, uterus, to, induce, abortion, although, this, method, is, no, longer, in, widespread, use, the, blood, urea, nitrogen, bun, test, is, a, measure, of, the, amount, of, nitrogen, in, the, blood, that, comes, from, urea, it, is, used, as, a, marker, of, renal, function, though, it, is, inferior, to, other, markers, such, as, creatinine, because, blood, urea, levels, are, influenced, by, other, factors, such, as, diet, dehydration, and, liver, function, urea, has, also, been, studied, as, an, excipient, in, drug, coated, balloon, dcb, coating, formulation, to, enhance, local, drug, delivery, to, stenotic, blood, vessels, urea, when, used, as, an, excipient, in, small, doses, 3, g, mm, 2, to, coat, dcb, surface, was, found, to, form, crystals, that, increase, drug, transfer, without, adverse, toxic, effects, on, vascular, endothelial, cells, urea, labeled, with, carbon, 14, or, carbon, 13, is, used, in, the, urea, breath, test, which, is, used, to, detect, the, presence, of, the, bacterium, helicobacter, pylori, h, pylori, in, the, stomach, and, duodenum, of, humans, associated, with, peptic, ulcers, the, test, detects, the, characteristic, enzyme, urease, produced, by, h, pylori, by, a, reaction, that, produces, ammonia, from, urea, this, increases, the, ph, reduces, the, acidity, of, the, stomach, environment, around, the, bacteria, similar, bacteria, species, to, h, pylori, can, be, identified, by, the, same, test, in, animals, such, as, apes, dogs, and, cats, including, big, cats, amino, acids, from, ingested, food, or, produced, from, catabolism, of, muscle, protein, that, are, used, for, the, synthesis, of, proteins, and, other, biological, substances, can, be, oxidized, by, the, body, as, an, alternative, source, of, energy, yielding, urea, and, carbon, dioxide, the, oxidation, pathway, starts, with, the, removal, of, the, amino, group, by, a, transaminase, the, amino, group, is, then, fed, into, the, urea, cycle, the, first, step, in, the, conversion, of, amino, acids, into, metabolic, waste, in, the, liver, is, removal, of, the, alpha, amino, nitrogen, which, produces, ammonia, because, ammonia, is, toxic, it, is, excreted, immediately, by, fish, converted, into, uric, acid, by, birds, and, converted, into, urea, by, mammals, ammonia, nh, 3, is, a, common, byproduct, of, the, metabolism, of, nitrogenous, compounds, ammonia, is, smaller, more, volatile, and, more, mobile, than, urea, if, allowed, to, accumulate, ammonia, would, raise, the, ph, in, cells, to, toxic, levels, therefore, many, organisms, convert, ammonia, to, urea, even, though, this, synthesis, has, a, net, energy, cost, being, practically, neutral, and, highly, soluble, in, water, urea, is, a, safe, vehicle, for, the, body, to, transport, and, excrete, excess, nitrogen, urea, is, synthesized, in, the, body, of, many, organisms, as, part, of, the, urea, cycle, either, from, the, oxidation, of, amino, acids, or, from, ammonia, in, this, cycle, amino, groups, donated, by, ammonia, and, l, aspartate, are, converted, to, urea, while, l, ornithine, citrulline, l, argininosuccinate, and, l, arginine, act, as, intermediates, urea, production, occurs, in, the, liver, and, is, regulated, by, n, acetylglutamate, urea, is, then, dissolved, into, the, blood, in, the, reference, range, of, 2, 5, to, 6, 7, mmol, l, and, further, transported, and, excreted, by, the, kidney, as, a, component, of, urine, in, addition, a, small, amount, of, urea, is, excreted, along, with, sodium, chloride, and, water, in, sweat, in, water, the, amine, groups, undergo, slow, displacement, by, water, molecules, producing, ammonia, ammonium, ions, and, bicarbonate, ions, for, this, reason, old, stale, urine, has, a, stronger, odor, than, fresh, urine, the, cycling, of, and, excretion, of, urea, by, the, kidneys, is, a, vital, part, of, mammalian, metabolism, besides, its, role, as, carrier, of, waste, nitrogen, urea, also, plays, a, role, in, the, countercurrent, exchange, system, of, the, nephrons, that, allows, for, reabsorption, of, water, and, critical, ions, from, the, excreted, urine, urea, is, reabsorbed, in, the, inner, medullary, collecting, ducts, of, the, nephrons, thus, raising, the, osmolarity, in, the, medullary, interstitium, surrounding, the, thin, descending, limb, of, the, loop, of, henle, which, makes, the, water, reabsorb, by, action, of, the, urea, transporter, 2, some, of, this, reabsorbed, urea, eventually, flows, back, into, the, thin, descending, limb, of, the, tubule, through, the, collecting, ducts, and, into, the, excreted, urine, the, body, uses, this, mechanism, which, is, controlled, by, the, antidiuretic, hormone, to, create, hyperosmotic, urine, i, e, urine, with, a, higher, concentration, of, dissolved, substances, than, the, blood, plasma, this, mechanism, is, important, to, prevent, the, loss, of, water, maintain, blood, pressure, and, maintain, a, suitable, concentration, of, sodium, ions, in, the, blood, plasma, the, equivalent, nitrogen, content, in, grams, of, urea, in, mmol, can, be, estimated, by, the, conversion, factor, 0, 028, g, mmol, furthermore, 1, gram, of, nitrogen, is, roughly, equivalent, to, 6, 25, grams, of, protein, and, 1, gram, of, protein, is, roughly, equivalent, to, 5, grams, of, muscle, tissue, in, situations, such, as, muscle, wasting, 1, mmol, of, excessive, urea, in, the, urine, as, measured, by, urine, volume, in, litres, multiplied, by, urea, concentration, in, mmol, l, roughly, corresponds, to, a, muscle, loss, of, 0, 67, gram, in, aquatic, organisms, the, most, common, form, of, nitrogen, waste, is, ammonia, whereas, land, dwelling, organisms, convert, the, toxic, ammonia, to, either, urea, or, uric, acid, urea, is, found, in, the, urine, of, mammals, and, amphibians, as, well, as, some, fish, birds, and, saurian, reptiles, have, a, different, form, of, nitrogen, metabolism, that, requires, less, water, and, leads, to, nitrogen, excretion, in, the, form, of, uric, acid, tadpoles, excrete, ammonia, but, shift, to, urea, production, during, metamorphosis, despite, the, generalization, above, the, urea, pathway, has, been, documented, not, only, in, mammals, and, amphibians, but, in, many, other, organisms, as, well, including, birds, invertebrates, insects, plants, yeast, fungi, and, even, microorganisms, urea, can, be, irritating, to, skin, eyes, and, the, respiratory, tract, repeated, or, prolonged, contact, with, urea, in, fertilizer, form, on, the, skin, may, cause, dermatitis, high, concentrations, in, the, blood, can, be, damaging, ingestion, of, low, concentrations, of, urea, such, as, are, found, in, typical, human, urine, are, not, dangerous, with, additional, water, ingestion, within, a, reasonable, time, frame, many, animals, e, g, camels, rodents, or, dogs, have, a, much, more, concentrated, urine, which, may, contain, a, higher, urea, amount, than, normal, human, urine, urea, can, cause, algal, blooms, to, produce, toxins, and, its, presence, in, the, runoff, from, fertilized, land, may, play, a, role, in, the, increase, of, toxic, blooms, the, substance, decomposes, on, heating, above, melting, point, producing, toxic, gases, and, reacts, violently, with, strong, oxidants, nitrites, inorganic, chlorides, chlorites, and, perchlorates, causing, fire, and, explosion, urea, was, first, discovered, in, urine, in, 1727, by, the, dutch, scientist, herman, boerhaave, although, this, discovery, is, often, attributed, to, the, french, chemist, hilaire, rouelle, as, well, as, william, cruickshank, boerhaave, used, the, following, steps, to, isolate, urea, in, 1828, the, german, chemist, friedrich, w, hler, obtained, urea, artificially, by, treating, silver, cyanate, with, ammonium, chloride, this, was, the, first, time, an, organic, compound, was, artificially, synthesized, from, inorganic, starting, materials, without, the, involvement, of, living, organisms, the, results, of, this, experiment, implicitly, discredited, vitalism, the, theory, that, the, chemicals, of, living, organisms, are, fundamentally, different, from, those, of, inanimate, matter, this, insight, was, important, for, the, development, of, organic, chemistry, his, discovery, prompted, w, hler, to, write, triumphantly, to, j, ns, jakob, berzelius, in, fact, his, second, sentence, was, incorrect, ammonium, cyanate, and, urea, co, nh, 2, 2, are, two, different, chemicals, with, the, same, empirical, formula, con, 2, h, 4, which, are, in, chemical, equilibrium, heavily, favoring, urea, under, standard, conditions, regardless, with, his, discovery, w, hler, secured, a, place, among, the, pioneers, of, organic, chemistry, uremic, frost, was, first, described, in, 1865, by, harald, hirschsprung, the, first, danish, pediatrician, in, 1870, who, also, described, the, disease, that, carries, his, name, in, 1886, uremic, frost, has, become, rare, since, the, advent, of, dialysis, it, is, the, classical, pre, dialysis, era, description, of, crystallized, urea, deposits, over, the, skin, of, patients, with, prolonged, kidney, failure, and, severe, uremia, urea, was, first, noticed, by, herman, boerhaave, in, the, early, 18th, century, from, evaporates, of, urine, in, 1773, hilaire, rouelle, obtained, crystals, containing, urea, from, human, urine, by, evaporating, it, and, treating, it, with, alcohol, in, successive, filtrations, this, method, was, aided, by, carl, wilhelm, scheele, s, discovery, that, urine, treated, by, concentrated, nitric, acid, precipitated, crystals, antoine, fran, ois, comte, de, fourcroy, and, louis, nicolas, vauquelin, discovered, in, 1799, that, the, nitrated, crystals, were, identical, to, rouelle, s, substance, and, invented, the, term, urea, berzelius, made, further, improvements, to, its, purification, and, finally, william, prout, in, 1817, succeeded, in, obtaining, and, determining, the, chemical, composition, of, the, pure, substance, in, the, evolved, procedure, urea, was, precipitated, as, urea, nitrate, by, adding, strong, nitric, acid, to, urine, to, purify, the, resulting, crystals, they, were, dissolved, in, boiling, water, with, charcoal, and, filtered, after, cooling, pure, crystals, of, urea, nitrate, form, to, reconstitute, the, urea, from, the, nitrate, the, crystals, are, dissolved, in, warm, water, and, barium, carbonate, added, the, water, is, then, evaporated, and, anhydrous, alcohol, added, to, extract, the, urea, this, solution, is, drained, off, and, evaporated, leaving, pure, urea, ureas, in, the, more, general, sense, can, be, accessed, in, the, laboratory, by, reaction, of, phosgene, with, primary, or, secondary, amines, these, reactions, proceed, through, an, isocyanate, intermediate, non, symmetric, ureas, can, be, accessed, by, the, reaction, of, primary, or, secondary, amines, with, an, isocyanate, urea, can, also, be, produced, by, heating, ammonium, cyanate, to, 60, c, in, 2020, worldwide, production, capacity, was, approximately, 180, million, tonnes, for, use, in, industry, urea, is, produced, from, synthetic, ammonia, and, carbon, dioxide, as, large, quantities, of, carbon, dioxide, are, produced, during, the, ammonia, manufacturing, process, as, a, byproduct, of, burning, hydrocarbons, to, generate, heat, predominantly, natural, gas, and, less, often, petroleum, derivatives, or, coal, urea, production, plants, are, almost, always, located, adjacent, to, the, site, where, the, ammonia, is, manufactured, the, basic, process, patented, in, 1922, is, called, the, bosch, meiser, urea, process, after, its, discoverers, carl, bosch, and, wilhelm, meiser, the, process, consists, of, two, main, equilibrium, reactions, with, incomplete, conversion, of, the, reactants, the, first, is, carbamate, formation, the, fast, exothermic, reaction, of, liquid, ammonia, with, gaseous, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, at, high, temperature, and, pressure, to, form, ammonium, carbamate, the, second, is, urea, conversion, the, slower, endothermic, decomposition, of, ammonium, carbamate, into, urea, and, water, the, overall, conversion, of, nh, 3, and, co, 2, to, urea, is, exothermic, with, the, reaction, heat, from, the, first, reaction, driving, the, second, the, conditions, that, favor, urea, formation, high, temperature, have, an, unfavorable, effect, on, the, carbamate, formation, equilibrium, the, process, conditions, are, a, compromise, the, ill, effect, on, the, first, reaction, of, the, high, temperature, around, 190, c, needed, for, the, second, is, compensated, for, by, conducting, the, process, under, high, pressure, 140, 175, bar, which, favors, the, first, reaction, although, it, is, necessary, to, compress, gaseous, carbon, dioxide, to, this, pressure, the, ammonia, is, available, from, the, ammonia, production, plant, in, liquid, form, which, can, be, pumped, into, the, system, much, more, economically, to, allow, the, slow, urea, formation, reaction, time, to, reach, equilibrium, a, large, reaction, space, is, needed, so, the, synthesis, reactor, in, a, large, urea, plant, tends, to, be, a, massive, pressure, vessel, because, the, urea, conversion, is, incomplete, the, urea, must, be, separated, from, the, unconverted, reactants, including, the, ammonium, carbamate, various, commercial, urea, processes, are, characterized, by, the, conditions, under, which, urea, forms, and, the, way, that, unconverted, reactants, are, further, processed, in, early, straight, through, urea, plants, reactant, recovery, the, first, step, in, recycling, was, done, by, letting, down, the, system, pressure, to, atmospheric, to, let, the, carbamate, decompose, back, to, ammonia, and, carbon, dioxide, originally, because, it, was, not, economic, to, recompress, the, ammonia, and, carbon, dioxide, for, recycle, the, ammonia, at, least, would, be, used, for, the, manufacture, of, other, products, such, as, ammonium, nitrate, or, ammonium, sulfate, and, the, carbon, dioxide, was, usually, wasted, later, process, schemes, made, recycling, unused, ammonia, and, carbon, dioxide, practical, this, was, accomplished, by, the, total, recycle, process, developed, in, the, 1940s, to, 1960s, and, now, called, the, conventional, recycle, process, it, proceeds, by, depressurizing, the, reaction, solution, in, stages, first, to, 18, 25, bar, and, then, to, 2, 5, bar, and, passing, it, at, each, stage, through, a, steam, heated, carbamate, decomposer, then, recombining, the, resulting, carbon, dioxide, and, ammonia, in, a, falling, film, carbamate, condenser, and, pumping, the, carbamate, solution, back, into, the, urea, reaction, vessel, the, conventional, recycle, process, for, recovering, and, reusing, the, reactants, has, largely, been, supplanted, by, a, stripping, process, developed, in, the, early, 1960s, by, stamicarbon, in, the, netherlands, that, operates, at, or, near, the, full, pressure, of, the, reaction, vessel, it, reduces, the, complexity, of, the, multi, stage, recycle, scheme, and, it, reduces, the, amount, of, water, recycled, in, the, carbamate, solution, which, has, an, adverse, effect, on, the, equilibrium, in, the, urea, conversion, reaction, and, thus, on, overall, plant, efficiency, effectively, all, new, urea, plants, use, the, stripper, and, many, total, recycle, urea, plants, have, converted, to, a, stripping, process, in, the, conventional, recycle, processes, carbamate, decomposition, is, promoted, by, reducing, the, overall, pressure, which, reduces, the, partial, pressure, of, both, ammonia, and, carbon, dioxide, allowing, these, gasses, to, be, separated, from, the, urea, product, solution, the, stripping, process, achieves, a, similar, effect, without, lowering, the, overall, pressure, by, suppressing, the, partial, pressure, of, just, one, of, the, reactants, in, order, to, promote, carbamate, decomposition, instead, of, feeding, carbon, dioxide, gas, directly, to, the, urea, synthesis, reactor, with, the, ammonia, as, in, the, conventional, process, the, stripping, process, first, routes, the, carbon, dioxide, through, the, stripper, the, stripper, is, a, carbamate, decomposer, that, provides, a, large, amount, of, gas, liquid, contact, this, flushes, out, free, ammonia, reducing, its, partial, pressure, over, the, liquid, surface, and, carrying, it, directly, to, a, carbamate, condenser, also, under, full, system, pressure, from, there, reconstituted, ammonium, carbamate, liquor, is, passed, to, the, urea, production, reactor, that, eliminates, the, medium, pressure, stage, of, the, conventional, recycle, process, the, three, main, side, reactions, that, produce, impurities, have, in, common, that, they, decompose, urea, urea, hydrolyzes, back, to, ammonium, carbamate, in, the, hottest, stages, of, the, synthesis, plant, especially, in, the, stripper, so, residence, times, in, these, stages, are, designed, to, be, short, biuret, is, formed, when, two, molecules, of, urea, combine, with, the, loss, of, a, molecule, of, ammonia, normally, this, reaction, is, suppressed, in, the, synthesis, reactor, by, maintaining, an, excess, of, ammonia, but, after, the, stripper, it, occurs, until, the, temperature, is, reduced, biuret, is, undesirable, in, urea, fertilizer, because, it, is, toxic, to, crop, plants, to, varying, degrees, but, it, is, sometimes, desirable, as, a, nitrogen, source, when, used, in, animal, feed, isocyanic, acid, hnco, and, ammonia, nh, 3, results, from, the, thermal, decomposition, of, ammonium, cyanate, which, is, in, chemical, equilibrium, with, urea, this, decomposition, is, at, its, worst, when, the, urea, solution, is, heated, at, low, pressure, which, happens, when, the, solution, is, concentrated, for, prilling, or, granulation, see, below, the, reaction, products, mostly, volatilize, into, the, overhead, vapours, and, recombine, when, these, condense, to, form, urea, again, which, contaminates, the, process, condensate, ammonium, carbamate, solutions, are, highly, corrosive, to, metallic, construction, materials, even, to, resistant, forms, of, stainless, steel, especially, in, the, hottest, parts, of, the, synthesis, plant, such, as, the, stripper, historically, corrosion, has, been, minimized, although, not, eliminated, by, continuous, injection, of, a, small, amount, of, oxygen, as, air, into, the, plant, to, establish, and, maintain, a, passive, oxide, layer, on, exposed, stainless, steel, surfaces, highly, corrosion, resistant, materials, have, been, introduced, to, reduce, the, need, for, passivation, oxygen, such, as, specialized, duplex, stainless, steels, in, the, 1990s, and, zirconium, or, zirconium, clad, titanium, tubing, in, the, 2000s, urea, can, be, produced, in, solid, forms, prills, granules, pellets, or, crystals, or, as, solutions, for, its, main, use, as, a, fertilizer, urea, is, mostly, marketed, in, solid, form, either, as, prills, or, granules, prills, are, solidified, droplets, whose, production, predates, satisfactory, urea, granulation, processes, prills, can, be, produced, more, cheaply, than, granules, but, the, limited, size, of, prills, up, to, about, 2, 1, mm, in, diameter, their, low, crushing, strength, and, the, caking, or, crushing, of, prills, during, bulk, storage, and, handling, make, them, inferior, to, granules, granules, are, produced, by, acretion, onto, urea, seed, particles, by, spraying, liquid, urea, in, a, succession, of, layers, formaldehyde, is, added, during, the, production, of, both, prills, and, granules, in, order, to, increase, crushing, strength, and, suppress, caking, other, shaping, techniques, such, as, pastillization, depositing, uniform, sized, liquid, droplets, onto, a, cooling, conveyor, belt, are, also, used, solutions, of, urea, and, ammonium, nitrate, in, water, uan, are, commonly, used, as, a, liquid, fertilizer, in, admixture, the, combined, solubility, of, ammonium, nitrate, and, urea, is, so, much, higher, than, that, of, either, component, alone, that, it, gives, a, stable, solution, with, a, total, nitrogen, content, 32, approaching, that, of, solid, ammonium, nitrate, 33, 5, though, not, of, course, that, of, urea, itself, 46, uan, allows, use, of, ammonium, nitrate, without, the, explosion, hazard, uan, accounts, for, 80, of, the, liquid, fertilizers, in, the, us
