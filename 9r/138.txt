the, horsehead, nebula, also, known, as, barnard, 33, or, b33, is, a, small, dark, nebula, in, the, constellation, orion, the, nebula, is, located, just, to, the, south, of, alnitak, the, easternmost, star, of, orion, s, belt, and, is, part, of, the, much, larger, orion, molecular, cloud, complex, it, appears, within, the, southern, region, of, the, dense, dust, cloud, known, as, lynds, 1630, along, the, edge, of, the, much, larger, active, star, forming, h, ii, region, called, ic, 434, the, horsehead, nebula, is, approximately, 422, parsecs, or, 1, 375, light, years, from, earth, it, is, one, of, the, most, identifiable, nebulae, because, of, its, resemblance, to, a, horse, s, head, using, nasa, s, james, webb, space, telescope, astronomers, have, captured, the, nebula, s, mane, in, unprecedented, detail, revealing, the, complexity, of, the, photodissociation, region, where, ultraviolet, light, interacts, with, gas, and, dust, the, nebula, was, discovered, by, scottish, astronomer, williamina, fleming, in, 1888, on, a, photographic, plate, taken, at, the, harvard, college, observatory, one, of, the, first, descriptions, was, made, by, e, e, barnard, describing, it, as, dark, mass, diam, 4, on, nebulous, strip, extending, south, from, orionis, cataloguing, the, dark, nebula, as, barnard, 33, the, dark, cloud, of, dust, and, gas, is, a, region, in, the, orion, molecular, cloud, complex, where, star, formation, is, taking, place, it, is, located, in, the, constellation, of, orion, which, is, prominent, in, the, winter, evening, sky, in, the, northern, hemisphere, and, the, summer, evening, sky, in, the, southern, hemisphere, colour, images, reveal, a, red, colour, that, originates, from, ionised, hydrogen, gas, h, predominantly, behind, the, nebula, and, caused, by, the, nearby, bright, star, sigma, orionis, magnetic, fields, channel, the, gases, leaving, the, nebula, into, streams, shown, as, foreground, streaks, against, the, background, glow, a, glowing, strip, of, hydrogen, gas, marks, the, edge, of, the, enormous, cloud, and, the, densities, of, nearby, stars, are, noticeably, different, on, either, side, heavy, concentrations, of, dust, in, the, horsehead, nebula, region, and, neighbouring, orion, nebula, are, localized, into, interstellar, clouds, resulting, in, alternating, sections, of, nearly, complete, opacity, and, transparency, the, darkness, of, the, horsehead, is, caused, mostly, by, thick, dust, blocking, the, light, of, stars, behind, it, the, lower, part, of, the, horsehead, s, neck, casts, a, shadow, to, the, left, the, visible, dark, nebula, emerging, from, the, gaseous, complex, is, an, active, site, of, the, formation, of, low, mass, stars, bright, spots, in, the, horsehead, nebula, s, base, are, young, stars, just, in, the, process, of, forming
