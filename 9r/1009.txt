in, engineering, deformation, the, change, in, size, or, shape, of, an, object, may, be, elastic, or, plastic, if, the, deformation, is, negligible, the, object, is, said, to, be, rigid, occurrence, of, deformation, in, engineering, applications, is, based, on, the, following, background, concepts, the, relationship, between, stress, and, strain, is, generally, linear, and, reversible, up, until, the, yield, point, and, the, deformation, is, elastic, elasticity, in, materials, occurs, when, applied, stress, does, not, surpass, the, energy, required, to, break, molecular, bonds, allowing, the, material, to, deform, reversibly, and, return, to, its, original, shape, once, the, stress, is, removed, the, linear, relationship, for, a, material, is, known, as, young, s, modulus, above, the, yield, point, some, degree, of, permanent, distortion, remains, after, unloading, and, is, termed, plastic, deformation, the, determination, of, the, stress, and, strain, throughout, a, solid, object, is, given, by, the, field, of, strength, of, materials, and, for, a, structure, by, structural, analysis, in, the, above, figure, it, can, be, seen, that, the, compressive, loading, indicated, by, the, arrow, has, caused, deformation, in, the, cylinder, so, that, the, original, shape, dashed, lines, has, changed, deformed, into, one, with, bulging, sides, the, sides, bulge, because, the, material, although, strong, enough, to, not, crack, or, otherwise, fail, is, not, strong, enough, to, support, the, load, without, change, as, a, result, the, material, is, forced, out, laterally, internal, forces, in, this, case, at, right, angles, to, the, deformation, resist, the, applied, load, depending, on, the, type, of, material, size, and, geometry, of, the, object, and, the, forces, applied, various, types, of, deformation, may, result, the, image, to, the, right, shows, the, engineering, stress, vs, strain, diagram, for, a, typical, ductile, material, such, as, steel, different, deformation, modes, may, occur, under, different, conditions, as, can, be, depicted, using, a, deformation, mechanism, map, permanent, deformation, is, irreversible, the, deformation, stays, even, after, removal, of, the, applied, forces, while, the, temporary, deformation, is, recoverable, as, it, disappears, after, the, removal, of, applied, forces, temporary, deformation, is, also, called, elastic, deformation, while, the, permanent, deformation, is, called, plastic, deformation, the, study, of, temporary, or, elastic, deformation, in, the, case, of, engineering, strain, is, applied, to, materials, used, in, mechanical, and, structural, engineering, such, as, concrete, and, steel, which, are, subjected, to, very, small, deformations, engineering, strain, is, modeled, by, infinitesimal, strain, theory, also, called, small, strain, theory, small, deformation, theory, small, displacement, theory, or, small, displacement, gradient, theory, where, strains, and, rotations, are, both, small, for, some, materials, e, g, elastomers, and, polymers, subjected, to, large, deformations, the, engineering, definition, of, strain, is, not, applicable, e, g, typical, engineering, strains, greater, than, 1, thus, other, more, complex, definitions, of, strain, are, required, such, as, stretch, logarithmic, strain, green, strain, and, almansi, strain, elastomers, and, shape, memory, metals, such, as, nitinol, exhibit, large, elastic, deformation, ranges, as, does, rubber, however, elasticity, is, nonlinear, in, these, materials, normal, metals, ceramics, and, most, crystals, show, linear, elasticity, and, a, smaller, elastic, range, linear, elastic, deformation, is, governed, by, hooke, s, law, which, states, where, this, relationship, only, applies, in, the, elastic, range, and, indicates, that, the, slope, of, the, stress, vs, strain, curve, can, be, used, to, find, young, s, modulus, e, engineers, often, use, this, calculation, in, tensile, tests, the, area, under, this, elastic, region, is, known, as, resilience, note, that, not, all, elastic, materials, undergo, linear, elastic, deformation, some, such, as, concrete, gray, cast, iron, and, many, polymers, respond, in, a, nonlinear, fashion, for, these, materials, hooke, s, law, is, inapplicable, this, type, of, deformation, is, not, undone, simply, by, removing, the, applied, force, an, object, in, the, plastic, deformation, range, however, will, first, have, undergone, elastic, deformation, which, is, undone, simply, be, removing, the, applied, force, so, the, object, will, return, part, way, to, its, original, shape, soft, thermoplastics, have, a, rather, large, plastic, deformation, range, as, do, ductile, metals, such, as, copper, silver, and, gold, steel, does, too, but, not, cast, iron, hard, thermosetting, plastics, rubber, crystals, and, ceramics, have, minimal, plastic, deformation, ranges, an, example, of, a, material, with, a, large, plastic, deformation, range, is, wet, chewing, gum, which, can, be, stretched, to, dozens, of, times, its, original, length, under, tensile, stress, plastic, deformation, is, characterized, by, a, strain, hardening, region, and, a, necking, region, and, finally, fracture, also, called, rupture, during, strain, hardening, the, material, becomes, stronger, through, the, movement, of, atomic, dislocations, the, necking, phase, is, indicated, by, a, reduction, in, cross, sectional, area, of, the, specimen, necking, begins, after, the, ultimate, strength, is, reached, during, necking, the, material, can, no, longer, withstand, the, maximum, stress, and, the, strain, in, the, specimen, rapidly, increases, plastic, deformation, ends, with, the, fracture, of, the, material, usually, compressive, stress, applied, to, bars, columns, etc, leads, to, shortening, loading, a, structural, element, or, specimen, will, increase, the, compressive, stress, until, it, reaches, its, compressive, strength, according, to, the, properties, of, the, material, failure, modes, are, yielding, for, materials, with, ductile, behavior, most, metals, some, soils, and, plastics, or, rupturing, for, brittle, behavior, geomaterials, cast, iron, glass, etc, in, long, slender, structural, elements, such, as, columns, or, truss, bars, an, increase, of, compressive, force, f, leads, to, structural, failure, due, to, buckling, at, lower, stress, than, the, compressive, strength, a, break, occurs, after, the, material, has, reached, the, end, of, the, elastic, and, then, plastic, deformation, ranges, at, this, point, forces, accumulate, until, they, are, sufficient, to, cause, a, fracture, all, materials, will, eventually, fracture, if, sufficient, forces, are, applied, engineering, stress, and, engineering, strain, are, approximations, to, the, internal, state, that, may, be, determined, from, the, external, forces, and, deformations, of, an, object, provided, that, there, is, no, significant, change, in, size, when, there, is, a, significant, change, in, size, the, true, stress, and, true, strain, can, be, derived, from, the, instantaneous, size, of, the, object, consider, a, bar, of, original, cross, sectional, area, a, 0, being, subjected, to, equal, and, opposite, forces, f, pulling, at, the, ends, so, the, bar, is, under, tension, the, material, is, experiencing, a, stress, defined, to, be, the, ratio, of, the, force, to, the, cross, sectional, area, of, the, bar, as, well, as, an, axial, elongation, subscript, 0, denotes, the, original, dimensions, of, the, sample, the, si, derived, unit, for, stress, is, newtons, per, square, metre, or, pascals, 1, pascal, 1, pa, 1, n, m, 2, and, strain, is, unitless, the, stress, strain, curve, for, this, material, is, plotted, by, elongating, the, sample, and, recording, the, stress, variation, with, strain, until, the, sample, fractures, by, convention, the, strain, is, set, to, the, horizontal, axis, and, stress, is, set, to, vertical, axis, note, that, for, engineering, purposes, we, often, assume, the, cross, section, area, of, the, material, does, not, change, during, the, whole, deformation, process, this, is, not, true, since, the, actual, area, will, decrease, while, deforming, due, to, elastic, and, plastic, deformation, the, curve, based, on, the, original, cross, section, and, gauge, length, is, called, the, engineering, stress, strain, curve, while, the, curve, based, on, the, instantaneous, cross, section, area, and, length, is, called, the, true, stress, strain, curve, unless, stated, otherwise, engineering, stress, strain, is, generally, used, in, the, above, definitions, of, engineering, stress, and, strain, two, behaviors, of, materials, in, tensile, tests, are, ignored, true, stress, and, true, strain, are, defined, differently, than, engineering, stress, and, strain, to, account, for, these, behaviors, they, are, given, as, here, the, dimensions, are, instantaneous, values, assuming, volume, of, the, sample, conserves, and, deformation, happens, uniformly, the, true, stress, and, strain, can, be, expressed, by, engineering, stress, and, strain, for, true, stress, for, the, strain, integrate, both, sides, and, apply, the, boundary, condition, so, in, a, tension, test, true, stress, is, larger, than, engineering, stress, and, true, strain, is, less, than, engineering, strain, thus, a, point, defining, true, stress, strain, curve, is, displaced, upwards, and, to, the, left, to, define, the, equivalent, engineering, stress, strain, curve, the, difference, between, the, true, and, engineering, stresses, and, strains, will, increase, with, plastic, deformation, at, low, strains, such, as, elastic, deformation, the, differences, between, the, two, is, negligible, as, for, the, tensile, strength, point, it, is, the, maximal, point, in, engineering, stress, strain, curve, but, is, not, a, special, point, in, true, stress, strain, curve, because, engineering, stress, is, proportional, to, the, force, applied, along, the, sample, the, criterion, for, necking, formation, can, be, set, as, f, 0, displaystyle, delta, f, 0, this, analysis, suggests, nature, of, the, ultimate, tensile, strength, uts, point, the, work, strengthening, effect, is, exactly, balanced, by, the, shrinking, of, section, area, at, uts, point, after, the, formation, of, necking, the, sample, undergoes, heterogeneous, deformation, so, equations, above, are, not, valid, the, stress, and, strain, at, the, necking, can, be, expressed, as, an, empirical, equation, is, commonly, used, to, describe, the, relationship, between, true, stress, and, true, strain, here, n, is, the, strain, hardening, exponent, and, k, is, the, strength, coefficient, n, is, a, measure, of, a, material, s, work, hardening, behavior, materials, with, a, higher, n, have, a, greater, resistance, to, necking, typically, metals, at, room, temperature, have, n, ranging, from, 0, 02, to, 0, 5, since, we, disregard, the, change, of, area, during, deformation, above, the, true, stress, and, strain, curve, should, be, re, derived, for, deriving, the, stress, strain, curve, we, can, assume, that, the, volume, change, is, 0, even, if, we, deformed, the, materials, we, can, assume, that, then, the, true, stress, can, be, expressed, as, below, additionally, the, true, strain, t, can, be, expressed, as, below, then, we, can, express, the, value, as, thus, we, can, induce, the, plot, in, terms, of, t, displaystyle, sigma, t, and, e, displaystyle, varepsilon, e, as, right, figure, additionally, based, on, the, true, stress, strain, curve, we, can, estimate, the, region, where, necking, starts, to, happen, since, necking, starts, to, appear, after, ultimate, tensile, stress, where, the, maximum, force, applied, we, can, express, this, situation, as, below, so, this, form, can, be, expressed, as, below, it, indicates, that, the, necking, starts, to, appear, where, reduction, of, area, becomes, much, significant, compared, to, the, stress, change, then, the, stress, will, be, localized, to, specific, area, where, the, necking, appears, additionally, we, can, induce, various, relation, based, on, true, stress, strain, curve, 1, true, strain, and, stress, curve, can, be, expressed, by, the, approximate, linear, relationship, by, taking, a, log, on, true, stress, and, strain, the, relation, can, be, expressed, as, below, where, k, displaystyle, k, is, stress, coefficient, and, n, displaystyle, n, is, strain, hardening, coefficient, usually, the, value, of, n, displaystyle, n, has, range, around, 0, 02, to, 0, 5, at, room, temperature, if, n, displaystyle, n, is, 1, we, can, express, this, material, as, perfect, elastic, material, 2, in, reality, stress, is, also, highly, dependent, on, the, rate, of, strain, variation, thus, we, can, induce, the, empirical, equation, based, on, the, strain, rate, variation, where, k, displaystyle, k, is, constant, related, to, the, material, flow, stress, t, displaystyle, dot, varepsilon, t, indicates, the, derivative, of, strain, by, the, time, which, is, also, known, as, strain, rate, m, displaystyle, m, is, the, strain, rate, sensitivity, moreover, value, of, m, displaystyle, m, is, related, to, the, resistance, toward, the, necking, usually, the, value, of, m, displaystyle, m, is, at, the, range, of, 0, 0, 1, at, room, temperature, and, as, high, as, 0, 8, when, the, temperature, is, increased, by, combining, the, 1, and, 2, we, can, create, the, ultimate, relation, as, below, where, k, displaystyle, k, is, the, global, constant, for, relating, strain, strain, rate, and, stress, 3, based, on, the, true, stress, strain, curve, and, its, derivative, form, we, can, estimate, the, strain, necessary, to, start, necking, this, can, be, calculated, based, on, the, intersection, between, true, stress, strain, curve, as, shown, in, right, this, figure, also, shows, the, dependency, of, the, necking, strain, at, different, temperature, in, case, of, fcc, metals, both, of, the, stress, strain, curve, at, its, derivative, are, highly, dependent, on, temperature, therefore, at, higher, temperature, necking, starts, to, appear, even, under, lower, strain, value, all, of, these, properties, indicate, the, importance, of, calculating, the, true, stress, strain, curve, for, further, analyzing, the, behavior, of, materials, in, sudden, environment, 4, a, graphical, method, so, called, considere, construction, can, help, determine, the, behavior, of, stress, strain, curve, whether, necking, or, drawing, happens, on, the, sample, by, setting, l, l, 0, displaystyle, lambda, l, l, 0, as, determinant, the, true, stress, and, strain, can, be, expressed, with, engineering, stress, and, strain, as, below, therefore, the, value, of, engineering, stress, can, be, expressed, by, the, secant, line, from, made, by, true, stress, and, displaystyle, lambda, value, where, 0, displaystyle, lambda, 0, to, 1, displaystyle, lambda, 1, by, analyzing, the, shape, of, t, displaystyle, sigma, t, lambda, diagram, and, secant, line, we, can, determine, whether, the, materials, show, drawing, or, necking, on, the, figure, a, there, is, only, concave, upward, considere, plot, it, indicates, that, there, is, no, yield, drop, so, the, material, will, be, suffered, from, fracture, before, it, yields, on, the, figure, b, there, is, specific, point, where, the, tangent, matches, with, secant, line, at, point, where, y, displaystyle, lambda, lambda, y, after, this, value, the, slope, becomes, smaller, than, the, secant, line, where, necking, starts, to, appear, on, the, figure, c, there, is, point, where, yielding, starts, to, appear, but, when, d, displaystyle, lambda, lambda, d, the, drawing, happens, after, drawing, all, the, material, will, stretch, and, eventually, show, fracture, between, y, displaystyle, lambda, y, and, d, displaystyle, lambda, d, the, material, itself, does, not, stretch, but, rather, only, the, neck, starts, to, stretch, out, a, popular, misconception, is, that, all, materials, that, bend, are, weak, and, those, that, do, not, are, strong, in, reality, many, materials, that, undergo, large, elastic, and, plastic, deformations, such, as, steel, are, able, to, absorb, stresses, that, would, cause, brittle, materials, such, as, glass, with, minimal, plastic, deformation, ranges, to, break
