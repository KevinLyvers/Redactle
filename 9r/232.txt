a, giant, planet, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, jovian, planet, jove, being, another, name, for, the, roman, god, jupiter, is, a, diverse, type, of, planet, much, larger, than, earth, giant, planets, are, usually, primarily, composed, of, low, boiling, point, materials, volatiles, rather, than, rock, or, other, solid, matter, but, massive, solid, planets, can, also, exist, there, are, four, such, planets, in, the, solar, system, jupiter, saturn, uranus, and, neptune, many, extrasolar, giant, planets, have, been, identified, giant, planets, are, sometimes, known, as, gas, giants, but, many, astronomers, now, apply, the, term, only, to, jupiter, and, saturn, classifying, uranus, and, neptune, which, have, different, compositions, as, ice, giants, both, names, are, potentially, misleading, the, solar, system, s, giant, planets, all, consist, primarily, of, fluids, above, their, critical, points, where, distinct, gas, and, liquid, phases, do, not, exist, jupiter, and, saturn, are, principally, made, of, hydrogen, and, helium, whilst, uranus, and, neptune, consist, of, water, ammonia, and, methane, the, defining, differences, between, a, very, low, mass, brown, dwarf, and, a, massive, gas, giant, 13, m, j, are, debated, one, school, of, thought, is, based, on, planetary, formation, the, other, on, the, physics, of, the, interior, of, planets, part, of, the, debate, concerns, whether, brown, dwarfs, must, by, definition, have, experienced, nuclear, fusion, at, some, point, in, their, history, the, term, gas, giant, was, coined, in, 1952, by, science, fiction, writer, james, blish, and, was, originally, used, to, refer, to, all, giant, planets, arguably, it, is, something, of, a, misnomer, because, throughout, most, of, the, volume, of, these, planets, the, pressure, is, so, high, that, matter, is, not, in, gaseous, form, other, than, the, upper, layers, of, the, atmosphere, all, matter, is, likely, beyond, the, critical, point, where, there, is, no, distinction, between, liquids, and, gases, fluid, planet, would, be, a, more, accurate, term, jupiter, also, has, metallic, hydrogen, near, its, center, but, much, of, its, volume, is, hydrogen, helium, and, traces, of, other, gases, above, their, critical, points, the, observable, atmospheres, of, all, these, planets, at, less, than, a, unit, optical, depth, are, quite, thin, compared, to, their, radii, only, extending, perhaps, one, percent, of, the, way, to, the, center, thus, the, observable, parts, are, gaseous, in, contrast, to, mars, and, earth, which, have, gaseous, atmospheres, through, which, the, crust, can, be, seen, the, rather, misleading, term, has, caught, on, because, planetary, scientists, typically, use, rock, gas, and, ice, as, shorthands, for, classes, of, elements, and, compounds, commonly, found, as, planetary, constituents, irrespective, of, the, matter, s, phase, in, the, outer, solar, system, hydrogen, and, helium, are, referred, to, as, gas, water, methane, and, ammonia, as, ice, and, silicates, and, metals, as, rock, when, deep, planetary, interiors, are, considered, it, may, not, be, far, off, to, say, that, by, ice, astronomers, mean, oxygen, and, carbon, by, rock, they, mean, silicon, and, by, gas, they, mean, hydrogen, and, helium, the, many, ways, in, which, uranus, and, neptune, differ, from, jupiter, and, saturn, have, led, some, to, use, the, term, only, for, planets, similar, to, the, latter, two, with, this, terminology, in, mind, some, astronomers, have, started, referring, to, uranus, and, neptune, as, ice, giants, to, indicate, the, predominance, of, the, ices, in, fluid, form, in, their, interior, composition, the, alternative, term, jovian, planet, refers, to, the, roman, god, jupiter, the, genitive, form, of, which, is, jovis, hence, jovian, and, was, intended, to, indicate, that, all, of, these, planets, were, similar, to, jupiter, objects, large, enough, to, start, deuterium, fusion, above, 13, jupiter, masses, for, solar, composition, are, called, brown, dwarfs, and, these, occupy, the, mass, range, between, that, of, large, giant, planets, and, the, lowest, mass, stars, the, 13, jupiter, mass, m, j, cutoff, is, a, rule, of, thumb, rather, than, something, of, precise, physical, significance, larger, objects, will, burn, most, of, their, deuterium, and, smaller, ones, will, burn, only, a, little, and, the, 13, m, j, value, is, somewhere, in, between, the, amount, of, deuterium, burnt, depends, not, only, on, the, mass, but, also, on, the, composition, of, the, planet, especially, on, the, amount, of, helium, and, deuterium, present, the, extrasolar, planets, encyclopaedia, includes, objects, up, to, 60, jupiter, masses, and, the, exoplanet, data, explorer, up, to, 24, jupiter, masses, a, giant, planet, is, a, massive, planet, and, has, a, thick, atmosphere, of, hydrogen, and, helium, they, may, have, a, condensed, core, of, heavier, elements, delivered, during, the, formation, process, this, core, may, be, partially, or, completely, dissolved, and, dispersed, throughout, the, hydrogen, helium, envelope, in, traditional, giant, planets, such, as, jupiter, and, saturn, the, gas, giants, hydrogen, and, helium, make, up, most, of, the, mass, of, the, planet, whereas, they, only, make, up, an, outer, envelope, on, uranus, and, neptune, which, are, instead, mostly, composed, of, water, ammonia, and, methane, and, therefore, increasingly, referred, to, as, ice, giants, extrasolar, giant, planets, that, orbit, very, close, to, their, stars, are, the, exoplanets, that, are, easiest, to, detect, these, are, called, hot, jupiters, and, hot, neptunes, because, they, have, very, high, surface, temperatures, hot, jupiters, were, until, the, advent, of, space, borne, telescopes, the, most, common, form, of, exoplanet, known, due, to, the, relative, ease, of, detecting, them, with, ground, based, instruments, giant, planets, are, commonly, said, to, lack, solid, surfaces, but, it, is, more, accurate, to, say, that, they, lack, surfaces, altogether, since, the, gases, that, form, them, simply, become, thinner, and, thinner, with, increasing, distance, from, the, planets, centers, eventually, becoming, indistinguishable, from, the, interplanetary, medium, therefore, landing, on, a, giant, planet, may, or, may, not, be, possible, depending, on, the, size, and, composition, of, its, core, gas, giants, consist, mostly, of, hydrogen, and, helium, the, solar, system, s, gas, giants, jupiter, and, saturn, have, heavier, elements, making, up, between, 3, and, 13, percent, of, their, mass, gas, giants, are, thought, to, consist, of, an, outer, layer, of, molecular, hydrogen, surrounding, a, layer, of, liquid, metallic, hydrogen, with, a, probable, molten, core, with, a, rocky, composition, jupiter, and, saturn, s, outermost, portion, of, the, hydrogen, atmosphere, has, many, layers, of, visible, clouds, that, are, mostly, composed, of, water, and, ammonia, the, layer, of, metallic, hydrogen, makes, up, the, bulk, of, each, planet, and, is, referred, to, as, metallic, because, the, very, high, pressure, turns, hydrogen, into, an, electrical, conductor, the, core, is, thought, to, consist, of, heavier, elements, at, such, high, temperatures, 20, 000, k, and, pressures, that, their, properties, are, poorly, understood, ice, giants, have, distinctly, different, interior, compositions, from, gas, giants, the, solar, system, s, ice, giants, uranus, and, neptune, have, a, hydrogen, rich, atmosphere, that, extends, from, the, cloud, tops, down, to, about, 80, uranus, or, 85, neptune, of, their, radius, below, this, they, are, predominantly, icy, i, e, consisting, mostly, of, water, methane, and, ammonia, there, is, also, some, rock, and, gas, but, various, proportions, of, ice, rock, gas, could, mimic, pure, ice, so, that, the, exact, proportions, are, unknown, uranus, and, neptune, have, very, hazy, atmospheric, layers, with, small, amounts, of, methane, giving, them, light, aquamarine, colors, both, have, magnetic, fields, that, are, sharply, inclined, to, their, axes, of, rotation, unlike, the, other, giant, planets, uranus, has, an, extreme, tilt, that, causes, its, seasons, to, be, severely, pronounced, the, two, planets, also, have, other, subtle, but, important, differences, uranus, has, more, hydrogen, and, helium, than, neptune, despite, being, less, massive, overall, neptune, is, therefore, denser, and, has, much, more, internal, heat, and, a, more, active, atmosphere, the, nice, model, in, fact, suggests, that, neptune, formed, closer, to, the, sun, than, uranus, did, and, should, therefore, have, more, heavy, elements, massive, solid, planets, seems, can, also, exist, though, their, formation, mechanisms, and, occurrence, remain, subjects, of, ongoing, research, and, debate, the, possibility, of, solid, planets, up, to, thousands, of, earth, masses, forming, around, massive, stars, b, type, and, o, type, stars, 5, 120, solar, masses, has, been, suggested, in, some, earlier, studies, the, hypothesis, proposed, that, the, protoplanetary, disk, around, such, stars, would, contain, enough, heavy, elements, and, that, high, uv, radiation, and, strong, winds, could, photoevaporate, the, gas, in, the, disk, leaving, just, the, heavy, elements, for, comparison, neptune, s, mass, equals, 17, earth, masses, jupiter, has, 318, earth, masses, and, the, 13, jupiter, mass, limit, used, in, the, iau, s, working, definition, of, an, exoplanet, equals, approximately, 4000, earth, masses, however, it, is, important, to, note, that, more, recent, research, has, called, into, question, the, likelihood, of, massive, solid, planet, formation, around, very, massive, stars, https, arxiv, org, pdf, 1103, 0556, studies, have, shown, that, the, ratio, of, protoplanetary, disk, mass, to, stellar, mass, decreases, rapidly, for, stars, above, 10, solar, masses, falling, to, less, than, 10, 4, furthermore, no, protoplanetary, disks, have, been, observed, around, o, type, stars, to, date, the, original, suggestion, of, massive, solid, planets, forming, around, 5, 120, solar, mass, stars, presented, in, earlier, literature, lacks, substantial, supporting, evidence, or, citations, to, planetary, formation, theories, the, study, in, question, primarily, focused, on, simulating, mass, radius, relationships, for, rocky, planets, including, hypothetical, super, massive, solid, planets, but, did, not, investigate, whether, planetary, formation, theories, actually, support, the, existence, of, such, objects, the, authors, of, that, study, acknowledged, that, such, massive, exoplanets, are, not, yet, known, to, exist, given, these, considerations, the, formation, and, existence, of, massive, solid, planets, around, very, massive, stars, remain, speculative, and, require, further, research, and, observational, evidence, a, super, puff, is, a, type, of, exoplanet, with, a, mass, only, a, few, times, larger, than, earth, s, but, a, radius, larger, than, neptune, giving, it, a, very, low, mean, density, they, are, cooler, and, less, massive, than, the, inflated, low, density, hot, jupiters, the, most, extreme, examples, known, are, the, three, planets, around, kepler, 51, which, are, all, jupiter, sized, but, with, densities, below, 0, 1, g, cm, 3, because, of, the, limited, techniques, currently, available, to, detect, exoplanets, many, of, those, found, to, date, have, been, of, a, size, associated, in, the, solar, system, with, giant, planets, because, these, large, planets, are, inferred, to, share, more, in, common, with, jupiter, than, with, the, other, giant, planets, some, have, claimed, that, jovian, planet, is, a, more, accurate, term, for, them, many, of, the, exoplanets, are, much, closer, to, their, parent, stars, and, hence, much, hotter, than, the, giant, planets, in, the, solar, system, making, it, possible, that, some, of, those, planets, are, a, type, not, observed, in, the, solar, system, considering, the, relative, abundances, of, the, elements, in, the, universe, approximately, 98, hydrogen, and, helium, it, would, be, surprising, to, find, a, predominantly, rocky, planet, more, massive, than, jupiter, on, the, other, hand, models, of, planetary, system, formation, have, suggested, that, giant, planets, would, be, inhibited, from, forming, as, close, to, their, stars, as, many, of, the, extrasolar, giant, planets, have, been, observed, to, orbit, the, bands, seen, in, the, atmosphere, of, jupiter, are, due, to, counter, circulating, streams, of, material, called, zones, and, belts, encircling, the, planet, parallel, to, its, equator, the, zones, are, the, lighter, bands, and, are, at, higher, altitudes, in, the, atmosphere, they, have, an, internal, updraft, and, are, high, pressure, regions, the, belts, are, the, darker, bands, are, lower, in, the, atmosphere, and, have, an, internal, downdraft, they, are, low, pressure, regions, these, structures, are, somewhat, analogous, to, the, high, and, low, pressure, cells, in, earth, s, atmosphere, but, they, have, a, very, different, structure, latitudinal, bands, that, circle, the, entire, planet, as, opposed, to, small, confined, cells, of, pressure, this, appears, to, be, a, result, of, the, rapid, rotation, and, underlying, symmetry, of, the, planet, there, are, no, oceans, or, landmasses, to, cause, local, heating, and, the, rotation, speed, is, much, higher, than, that, of, earth, there, are, smaller, structures, as, well, spots, of, different, sizes, and, colors, on, jupiter, the, most, noticeable, of, these, features, is, the, great, red, spot, which, has, been, present, for, at, least, 300, years, these, structures, are, huge, storms, some, such, spots, are, thunderheads, as, well, solar, system, local, interstellar, cloud, local, bubble, gould, belt, orion, arm, milky, way, milky, way,
