in, organic, chemistry, a, thiol, a, l, from, ancient, greek, theion, sulfur, or, thiol, derivative, is, any, organosulfur, compound, of, the, form, r, sh, where, r, represents, an, alkyl, or, other, organic, substituent, the, sh, functional, group, itself, is, referred, to, as, either, a, thiol, group, or, a, sulfhydryl, group, or, a, sulfanyl, group, thiols, are, the, sulfur, analogue, of, alcohols, that, is, sulfur, takes, the, place, of, oxygen, in, the, hydroxyl, oh, group, of, an, alcohol, and, the, word, is, a, blend, of, thio, with, alcohol, many, thiols, have, strong, odors, resembling, that, of, garlic, or, rotten, eggs, thiols, are, used, as, odorants, to, assist, in, the, detection, of, natural, gas, which, in, pure, form, is, odorless, and, the, smell, of, natural, gas, is, due, to, the, smell, of, the, thiol, used, as, the, odorant, thiols, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, mercaptans, m, r, k, p, t, n, or, mercapto, compounds, a, term, introduced, in, 1832, by, william, christopher, zeise, and, is, derived, from, the, latin, mercurio, capt, ns, capturing, mercury, because, the, thiolate, group, rs, bonds, very, strongly, with, mercury, compounds, thiols, having, the, structure, r, sh, in, which, an, alkyl, group, r, is, attached, to, a, sulfhydryl, group, sh, are, referred, to, as, alkanethiols, or, alkyl, thiols, thiols, and, alcohols, have, similar, connectivity, because, sulfur, atoms, are, larger, than, oxygen, atoms, c, s, bond, lengths, typically, around, 180, picometres, are, about, 40, picometers, longer, than, typical, c, o, bonds, the, c, s, h, angles, approach, 90, whereas, the, angle, for, the, c, o, h, group, is, more, obtuse, in, solids, and, liquids, the, hydrogen, bonding, between, individual, thiol, groups, is, weak, the, main, cohesive, force, being, van, der, waals, interactions, between, the, highly, polarizable, divalent, sulfur, centers, the, s, h, bond, is, much, weaker, than, the, o, h, bond, as, reflected, in, their, respective, bond, dissociation, energies, bde, for, ch, 3, s, h, the, bde, is, 366, kj, mol, 87, kcal, mol, while, for, ch, 3, o, h, the, bde, is, 440, kj, mol, 110, kcal, mol, an, s, h, bond, is, moderately, polar, because, of, the, small, difference, in, the, electronegativity, of, sulfur, and, hydrogen, in, contrast, o, h, bonds, in, hydroxyl, groups, are, more, polar, thiols, have, a, lower, dipole, moment, relative, to, their, corresponding, alcohols, there, are, several, ways, to, name, the, alkylthiols, many, thiols, have, strong, odors, resembling, that, of, garlic, the, odors, of, thiols, particularly, those, of, low, molecular, weight, are, often, strong, and, repulsive, the, spray, of, skunks, consists, mainly, of, low, molecular, weight, thiols, and, derivatives, these, compounds, are, detectable, by, the, human, nose, at, concentrations, of, only, 10, parts, per, billion, human, sweat, contains, r, s, 3, methyl, 3, mercapto, 1, ol, msh, detectable, at, 2, parts, per, billion, and, having, a, fruity, onion, like, odor, methylthio, methanethiol, mesch, 2, sh, mtmt, is, a, strong, smelling, volatile, thiol, also, detectable, at, parts, per, billion, levels, found, in, male, mouse, urine, lawrence, c, katz, and, co, workers, showed, that, mtmt, functioned, as, a, semiochemical, activating, certain, mouse, olfactory, sensory, neurons, and, attracting, female, mice, copper, has, been, shown, to, be, required, by, a, specific, mouse, olfactory, receptor, mor244, 3, which, is, highly, responsive, to, mtmt, as, well, as, to, various, other, thiols, and, related, compounds, a, human, olfactory, receptor, or2t11, has, been, identified, which, in, the, presence, of, copper, is, highly, responsive, to, the, gas, odorants, see, below, ethanethiol, and, t, butyl, mercaptan, as, well, as, other, low, molecular, weight, thiols, including, allyl, mercaptan, found, in, human, garlic, breath, and, the, strong, smelling, cyclic, sulfide, thietane, thiols, are, also, responsible, for, a, class, of, wine, faults, caused, by, an, unintended, reaction, between, sulfur, and, yeast, and, the, skunky, odor, of, beer, that, has, been, exposed, to, ultraviolet, light, not, all, thiols, have, unpleasant, odors, for, example, furan, 2, ylmethanethiol, contributes, to, the, aroma, of, roasted, coffee, whereas, grapefruit, mercaptan, a, monoterpenoid, thiol, is, responsible, for, the, characteristic, scent, of, grapefruit, the, effect, of, the, latter, compound, is, present, only, at, low, concentrations, the, pure, mercaptan, has, an, unpleasant, odor, in, the, united, states, natural, gas, distributors, were, required, to, add, thiols, originally, ethanethiol, to, natural, gas, which, is, naturally, odorless, after, the, deadly, new, london, school, explosion, in, new, london, texas, in, 1937, many, gas, distributors, were, odorizing, gas, prior, to, this, event, most, currently, used, gas, odorants, contain, mixtures, of, mercaptans, and, sulfides, with, t, butyl, mercaptan, as, the, main, odor, constituent, in, natural, gas, and, ethanethiol, in, liquefied, petroleum, gas, lpg, propane, in, situations, where, thiols, are, used, in, commercial, industry, such, as, liquid, petroleum, gas, tankers, and, bulk, handling, systems, an, oxidizing, catalyst, is, used, to, destroy, the, odor, a, copper, based, oxidation, catalyst, neutralizes, the, volatile, thiols, and, transforms, them, into, inert, products, thiols, show, little, association, by, hydrogen, bonding, both, with, water, molecules, and, among, themselves, hence, they, have, lower, boiling, points, and, are, less, soluble, in, water, and, other, polar, solvents, than, alcohols, of, similar, molecular, weight, for, this, reason, also, thiols, and, their, corresponding, sulfide, functional, group, isomers, have, similar, solubility, characteristics, and, boiling, points, whereas, the, same, is, not, true, of, alcohols, and, their, corresponding, isomeric, ethers, the, s, h, bond, in, thiols, is, weak, compared, to, the, o, h, bond, in, alcohols, for, ch, 3, x, h, the, bond, enthalpies, are, 365, 07, 2, 1, kcal, mol, for, x, s, and, 440, 2, 3, 0, kcal, mol, for, x, o, hydrogen, atom, abstraction, from, a, thiol, gives, a, thiyl, radical, with, the, formula, rs, where, r, alkyl, or, aryl, volatile, thiols, are, easily, and, almost, unerringly, detected, by, their, distinctive, odor, sulfur, specific, analyzers, for, gas, chromatographs, are, useful, spectroscopic, indicators, are, the, d, 2, o, exchangeable, s, h, signal, in, the, 1, h, nmr, spectrum, 33, s, is, nmr, active, but, signals, for, divalent, sulfur, are, very, broad, and, of, little, utility, the, sh, band, appears, near, 2400, cm, 1, in, the, ir, spectrum, in, the, nitroprusside, reaction, free, thiol, groups, react, with, sodium, nitroprusside, and, ammonium, hydroxide, to, give, a, red, colour, in, industry, methanethiol, is, prepared, by, the, reaction, of, hydrogen, sulfide, with, methanol, this, method, is, employed, for, the, industrial, synthesis, of, methanethiol, such, reactions, are, conducted, in, the, presence, of, acidic, catalysts, the, other, principal, route, to, thiols, involves, the, addition, of, hydrogen, sulfide, to, alkenes, such, reactions, are, usually, conducted, in, the, presence, of, an, acid, catalyst, or, uv, light, halide, displacement, using, the, suitable, organic, halide, and, sodium, hydrogen, sulfide, has, also, been, used, another, method, entails, the, alkylation, of, sodium, hydrosulfide, this, method, is, used, for, the, production, of, thioglycolic, acid, from, chloroacetic, acid, in, general, on, the, typical, laboratory, scale, the, direct, reaction, of, a, haloalkane, with, sodium, hydrosulfide, is, in, efficient, owing, to, the, competing, formation, of, sulfides, instead, alkyl, halides, are, converted, to, thiols, via, an, s, alkylation, of, thiourea, this, multistep, one, pot, process, proceeds, via, the, intermediacy, of, the, isothiouronium, salt, which, is, hydrolyzed, in, a, separate, step, the, thiourea, route, works, well, with, primary, halides, especially, activated, ones, secondary, and, tertiary, thiols, are, less, easily, prepared, secondary, thiols, can, be, prepared, from, the, ketone, via, the, corresponding, dithioketals, a, related, two, step, process, involves, alkylation, of, thiosulfate, to, give, the, thiosulfonate, bunte, salt, followed, by, hydrolysis, the, method, is, illustrated, by, one, synthesis, of, thioglycolic, acid, organolithium, compounds, and, grignard, reagents, react, with, sulfur, to, give, the, thiolates, which, are, readily, hydrolyzed, phenols, can, be, converted, to, the, thiophenols, via, rearrangement, of, their, o, aryl, dialkylthiocarbamates, thiols, are, prepared, by, reductive, dealkylation, of, sulfides, especially, benzyl, derivatives, and, thioacetals, thiophenols, are, produced, by, s, arylation, or, the, replacement, of, diazonium, leaving, group, with, sulfhydryl, anion, sh, akin, to, the, chemistry, of, alcohols, thiols, form, sulfides, thioacetals, and, thioesters, which, are, analogous, to, ethers, acetals, and, esters, respectively, thiols, and, alcohols, are, also, very, different, in, their, reactivity, thiols, being, more, easily, oxidized, than, alcohols, thiolates, are, more, potent, nucleophiles, than, the, corresponding, alkoxides, thiols, or, more, specific, their, conjugate, bases, are, readily, alkylated, to, give, sulfides, thiols, are, easily, deprotonated, relative, to, the, alcohols, thiols, are, more, acidic, the, conjugate, base, of, a, thiol, is, called, a, thiolate, butanethiol, has, a, p, k, a, of, 10, 5, vs, 15, for, butanol, thiophenol, has, a, p, k, a, of, 6, versus, 10, for, phenol, a, highly, acidic, thiol, is, pentafluorothiophenol, c, 6, f, 5, sh, with, a, p, k, a, of, 2, 68, thus, thiolates, can, be, obtained, from, thiols, by, treatment, with, alkali, metal, hydroxides, thiols, especially, in, the, presence, of, base, are, readily, oxidized, by, reagents, such, as, bromine, and, iodine, to, give, an, organic, disulfide, r, s, s, r, oxidation, by, more, powerful, reagents, such, as, sodium, hypochlorite, or, hydrogen, peroxide, can, also, yield, sulfonic, acids, rso, 3, h, oxidation, can, also, be, effected, by, oxygen, in, the, presence, of, catalysts, thiols, participate, in, thiol, disulfide, exchange, this, reaction, is, important, in, nature, with, metal, ions, thiolates, behave, as, ligands, to, form, transition, metal, thiolate, complexes, the, term, mercaptan, is, derived, from, the, latin, mercurium, captans, capturing, mercury, because, the, thiolate, group, bonds, so, strongly, with, mercury, compounds, according, to, hard, soft, acid, base, hsab, theory, sulfur, is, a, relatively, soft, polarizable, atom, this, explains, the, tendency, of, thiols, to, bind, to, soft, elements, and, ions, such, as, mercury, lead, or, cadmium, the, stability, of, metal, thiolates, parallels, that, of, the, corresponding, sulfide, minerals, thiolates, react, with, carbon, disulfide, to, give, thioxanthate, rscs, 2, free, radicals, derived, from, mercaptans, called, thiyl, radicals, are, commonly, invoked, to, explain, reactions, in, organic, chemistry, and, biochemistry, they, have, the, formula, rs, where, r, is, an, organic, substituent, such, as, alkyl, or, aryl, they, arise, from, or, can, be, generated, by, a, number, of, routes, but, the, principal, method, is, h, atom, abstraction, from, thiols, another, method, involves, homolysis, of, organic, disulfides, in, biology, thiyl, radicals, are, responsible, for, the, formation, of, the, deoxyribonucleic, acids, building, blocks, for, dna, this, conversion, is, catalysed, by, ribonucleotide, reductase, see, figure, thiyl, intermediates, also, are, produced, by, the, oxidation, of, glutathione, an, antioxidant, in, biology, thiyl, radicals, sulfur, centred, can, transform, to, carbon, centred, radicals, via, hydrogen, atom, exchange, equilibria, the, formation, of, carbon, centred, radicals, could, lead, to, protein, damage, via, the, formation, of, c, c, bonds, or, backbone, fragmentation, because, of, the, weakness, of, the, s, h, bond, thiols, can, function, as, scavengers, of, free, radicals, as, the, functional, group, of, the, amino, acid, cysteine, the, thiol, group, plays, a, very, important, role, in, biology, when, the, thiol, groups, of, two, cysteine, residues, as, in, monomers, or, constituent, units, are, brought, near, each, other, in, the, course, of, protein, folding, an, oxidation, reaction, can, generate, a, cystine, unit, with, a, disulfide, bond, s, s, disulfide, bonds, can, contribute, to, a, protein, s, tertiary, structure, if, the, cysteines, are, part, of, the, same, peptide, chain, or, contribute, to, the, quaternary, structure, of, multi, unit, proteins, by, forming, fairly, strong, covalent, bonds, between, different, peptide, chains, a, physical, manifestation, of, cysteine, cystine, equilibrium, is, provided, by, hair, straightening, technologies, sulfhydryl, groups, in, the, active, site, of, an, enzyme, can, form, noncovalent, bonds, with, the, enzyme, s, substrate, as, well, contributing, to, covalent, catalytic, activity, in, catalytic, triads, active, site, cysteine, residues, are, the, functional, unit, in, cysteine, protease, catalytic, triads, cysteine, residues, may, also, react, with, heavy, metal, ions, zn, 2, cd, 2, pb, 2, hg, 2, ag, because, of, the, high, affinity, between, the, soft, sulfide, and, the, soft, metal, see, hard, and, soft, acids, and, bases, this, can, deform, and, inactivate, the, protein, and, is, one, mechanism, of, heavy, metal, poisoning, drugs, containing, thiol, group, 6, mercaptopurine, anticancer, captopril, antihypertensive, d, penicillamine, antiarthritic, sodium, aurothiolate, antiarthritic, many, cofactors, non, protein, based, helper, molecules, feature, thiols, the, biosynthesis, and, degradation, of, fatty, acids, and, related, long, chain, hydrocarbons, is, conducted, on, a, scaffold, that, anchors, the, growing, chain, through, a, thioester, derived, from, the, thiol, coenzyme, a, the, biosynthesis, of, methane, the, principal, hydrocarbon, on, earth, arises, from, the, reaction, mediated, by, coenzyme, m, 2, mercaptoethyl, sulfonic, acid, thiolates, the, conjugate, bases, derived, from, thiols, form, strong, complexes, with, many, metal, ions, especially, those, classified, as, soft, the, stability, of, metal, thiolates, parallels, that, of, the, corresponding, sulfide, minerals, the, defensive, spray, of, skunks, consists, mainly, of, low, molecular, weight, thiols, and, derivatives, with, a, foul, odor, which, protects, the, skunk, from, predators, owls, are, able, to, prey, on, skunks, as, they, lack, a, sense, of, smell
