molybdenum, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, mo, from, neo, latin, molybdaenum, and, atomic, number, 42, the, name, derived, from, ancient, greek, molybdos, meaning, lead, since, its, ores, were, confused, with, lead, ores, molybdenum, minerals, have, been, known, throughout, history, but, the, element, was, discovered, in, the, sense, of, differentiating, it, as, a, new, entity, from, the, mineral, salts, of, other, metals, in, 1778, by, carl, wilhelm, scheele, the, metal, was, first, isolated, in, 1781, by, peter, jacob, hjelm, molybdenum, does, not, occur, naturally, as, a, free, metal, on, earth, in, its, minerals, it, is, found, only, in, oxidized, states, the, free, element, a, silvery, metal, with, a, grey, cast, has, the, sixth, highest, melting, point, of, any, element, it, readily, forms, hard, stable, carbides, in, alloys, and, for, this, reason, most, of, the, world, production, of, the, element, about, 80, is, used, in, steel, alloys, including, high, strength, alloys, and, superalloys, most, molybdenum, compounds, have, low, solubility, in, water, heating, molybdenum, bearing, minerals, under, oxygen, and, water, affords, molybdate, ion, moo, 2, 4, which, forms, quite, soluble, salts, industrially, molybdenum, compounds, about, 14, of, world, production, of, the, element, are, used, as, pigments, and, catalysts, molybdenum, bearing, enzymes, are, by, far, the, most, common, bacterial, catalysts, for, breaking, the, chemical, bond, in, atmospheric, molecular, nitrogen, in, the, process, of, biological, nitrogen, fixation, at, least, 50, molybdenum, enzymes, are, now, known, in, bacteria, plants, and, animals, although, only, bacterial, and, cyanobacterial, enzymes, are, involved, in, nitrogen, fixation, most, nitrogenases, contain, an, iron, molybdenum, cofactor, femoco, which, is, believed, to, contain, either, mo, iii, or, mo, iv, by, contrast, mo, vi, and, mo, iv, are, complexed, with, molybdopterin, in, all, other, molybdenum, bearing, enzymes, molybdenum, is, an, essential, element, for, all, higher, eukaryote, organisms, including, humans, a, species, of, sponge, theonella, conica, is, known, for, hyperaccumulation, of, molybdenum, in, its, pure, form, molybdenum, is, a, silvery, grey, metal, with, a, mohs, hardness, of, 5, 5, and, a, standard, atomic, weight, of, 95, 95, g, mol, it, has, a, melting, point, of, 2, 623, c, 4, 753, f, sixth, highest, of, the, naturally, occurring, elements, only, tantalum, osmium, rhenium, tungsten, and, carbon, have, higher, melting, points, it, has, one, of, the, lowest, coefficients, of, thermal, expansion, among, commercially, used, metals, molybdenum, is, a, transition, metal, with, an, electronegativity, of, 2, 16, on, the, pauling, scale, it, does, not, visibly, react, with, oxygen, or, water, at, room, temperature, but, is, attacked, by, halogens, and, hydrogen, peroxide, weak, oxidation, of, molybdenum, starts, at, 300, c, 572, f, bulk, oxidation, occurs, at, temperatures, above, 600, c, resulting, in, molybdenum, trioxide, like, many, heavier, transition, metals, molybdenum, shows, little, inclination, to, form, a, cation, in, aqueous, solution, although, the, mo, 3, cation, is, known, to, form, under, carefully, controlled, conditions, gaseous, molybdenum, consists, of, the, diatomic, species, mo, 2, that, molecule, is, a, singlet, with, two, unpaired, electrons, in, bonding, orbitals, in, addition, to, 5, conventional, bonds, the, result, is, a, sextuple, bond, there, are, 39, known, isotopes, of, molybdenum, ranging, in, atomic, mass, from, 81, to, 119, as, well, as, 13, metastable, nuclear, isomers, seven, isotopes, occur, naturally, with, atomic, masses, of, 92, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, and, 100, of, these, naturally, occurring, isotopes, only, molybdenum, 100, is, unstable, molybdenum, 98, is, the, most, abundant, isotope, comprising, 24, 14, of, all, molybdenum, molybdenum, 100, has, a, half, life, of, about, 10, 19, y, and, undergoes, double, beta, decay, into, ruthenium, 100, all, unstable, isotopes, of, molybdenum, decay, into, isotopes, of, niobium, technetium, and, ruthenium, of, the, synthetic, radioisotopes, the, most, stable, is, 93, mo, with, a, half, life, of, 4, 839, years, the, most, common, isotopic, molybdenum, application, involves, molybdenum, 99, which, is, a, fission, product, it, is, a, parent, radioisotope, to, the, short, lived, gamma, emitting, daughter, radioisotope, technetium, 99m, a, nuclear, isomer, used, in, various, imaging, applications, in, medicine, in, 2008, the, delft, university, of, technology, applied, for, a, patent, on, the, molybdenum, 98, based, production, of, molybdenum, 99, molybdenum, forms, chemical, compounds, in, oxidation, states, 4, and, from, 2, to, 6, higher, oxidation, states, are, more, relevant, to, its, terrestrial, occurrence, and, its, biological, roles, mid, level, oxidation, states, are, often, associated, with, metal, clusters, and, very, low, oxidation, states, are, typically, associated, with, organomolybdenum, compounds, the, chemistry, of, molybdenum, and, tungsten, show, strong, similarities, the, relative, rarity, of, molybdenum, iii, for, example, contrasts, with, the, pervasiveness, of, the, chromium, iii, compounds, the, highest, oxidation, state, is, seen, in, molybdenum, vi, oxide, moo, 3, whereas, the, normal, sulfur, compound, is, molybdenum, disulfide, mos, 2, from, the, perspective, of, commerce, the, most, important, compounds, are, molybdenum, disulfide, mos, 2, and, molybdenum, trioxide, moo, 3, the, black, disulfide, is, the, main, mineral, it, is, roasted, in, air, to, give, the, trioxide, the, trioxide, which, is, volatile, at, high, temperatures, is, the, precursor, to, virtually, all, other, mo, compounds, as, well, as, alloys, molybdenum, has, several, oxidation, states, the, most, stable, being, 4, and, 6, bolded, in, the, table, at, left, molybdenum, vi, oxide, is, soluble, in, strong, alkaline, water, forming, molybdates, moo, 4, 2, molybdates, are, weaker, oxidants, than, chromates, they, tend, to, form, structurally, complex, oxyanions, by, condensation, at, lower, ph, values, such, as, 6, and, 4, polymolybdates, can, incorporate, other, ions, forming, polyoxometalates, the, dark, blue, phosphorus, containing, heteropolymolybdate, p, 3, is, used, for, the, spectroscopic, detection, of, phosphorus, the, broad, range, of, oxidation, states, of, molybdenum, is, reflected, in, various, molybdenum, chlorides, the, accessibility, of, these, oxidation, states, depends, quite, strongly, on, the, halide, counterion, although, molybdenum, vi, fluoride, is, stable, molybdenum, does, not, form, a, stable, hexachloride, pentabromide, or, tetraiodide, like, chromium, and, some, other, transition, metals, molybdenum, forms, quadruple, bonds, such, as, in, mo, 2, ch, 3, coo, 4, and, 4, the, lewis, acid, properties, of, the, butyrate, and, perfluorobutyrate, dimers, mo, 2, o, 2, cr, 4, and, rh, 2, o, 2, cr, 4, have, been, reported, the, oxidation, state, 0, and, lower, are, possible, with, carbon, monoxide, as, ligand, such, as, in, molybdenum, hexacarbonyl, mo, co, 6, molybdenite, the, principal, ore, from, which, molybdenum, is, now, extracted, was, previously, known, as, molybdena, molybdena, was, confused, with, and, often, utilized, as, though, it, were, graphite, like, graphite, molybdenite, can, be, used, to, blacken, a, surface, or, as, a, solid, lubricant, even, when, molybdena, was, distinguishable, from, graphite, it, was, still, confused, with, the, common, lead, ore, pbs, now, called, galena, the, name, comes, from, ancient, greek, molybdos, meaning, lead, the, greek, word, itself, has, been, proposed, as, a, loanword, from, anatolian, luvian, and, lydian, languages, although, reportedly, molybdenum, was, deliberately, alloyed, with, steel, in, one, 14th, century, japanese, sword, mfd, c, 1330, that, art, was, never, employed, widely, and, was, later, lost, in, the, west, in, 1754, bengt, andersson, qvist, examined, a, sample, of, molybdenite, and, determined, that, it, did, not, contain, lead, and, thus, was, not, galena, by, 1778, swedish, chemist, carl, wilhelm, scheele, stated, firmly, that, molybdena, was, indeed, neither, galena, nor, graphite, instead, scheele, correctly, proposed, that, molybdena, was, an, ore, of, a, distinct, new, element, named, molybdenum, for, the, mineral, in, which, it, resided, and, from, which, it, might, be, isolated, peter, jacob, hjelm, successfully, isolated, molybdenum, using, carbon, and, linseed, oil, in, 1781, for, the, next, century, molybdenum, had, no, industrial, use, it, was, relatively, scarce, the, pure, metal, was, difficult, to, extract, and, the, necessary, techniques, of, metallurgy, were, immature, early, molybdenum, steel, alloys, showed, great, promise, of, increased, hardness, but, efforts, to, manufacture, the, alloys, on, a, large, scale, were, hampered, with, inconsistent, results, a, tendency, toward, brittleness, and, recrystallization, in, 1906, william, d, coolidge, filed, a, patent, for, rendering, molybdenum, ductile, leading, to, applications, as, a, heating, element, for, high, temperature, furnaces, and, as, a, support, for, tungsten, filament, light, bulbs, oxide, formation, and, degradation, require, that, molybdenum, be, physically, sealed, or, held, in, an, inert, gas, in, 1913, frank, e, elmore, developed, a, froth, flotation, process, to, recover, molybdenite, from, ores, flotation, remains, the, primary, isolation, process, during, world, war, i, demand, for, molybdenum, spiked, it, was, used, both, in, armor, plating, and, as, a, substitute, for, tungsten, in, high, speed, steels, some, british, tanks, were, protected, by, 75, mm, 3, in, manganese, steel, plating, but, this, proved, to, be, ineffective, the, manganese, steel, plates, were, replaced, with, much, lighter, 25, mm, 1, 0, in, molybdenum, steel, plates, allowing, for, higher, speed, greater, maneuverability, and, better, protection, the, germans, also, used, molybdenum, doped, steel, for, heavy, artillery, like, in, the, super, heavy, howitzer, big, bertha, because, traditional, steel, melts, at, the, temperatures, produced, by, the, propellant, of, the, one, ton, shell, after, the, war, demand, plummeted, until, metallurgical, advances, allowed, extensive, development, of, peacetime, applications, in, world, war, ii, molybdenum, again, saw, strategic, importance, as, a, substitute, for, tungsten, in, steel, alloys, molybdenum, is, the, 54th, most, abundant, element, in, the, earth, s, crust, with, an, average, of, 1, 5, parts, per, million, and, the, 25th, most, abundant, element, in, the, oceans, with, an, average, of, 10, parts, per, billion, it, is, the, 42nd, most, abundant, element, in, the, universe, the, soviet, luna, 24, mission, discovered, a, molybdenum, bearing, grain, 1, 0, 6, m, in, a, pyroxene, fragment, taken, from, mare, crisium, on, the, moon, the, comparative, rarity, of, molybdenum, in, the, earth, s, crust, is, offset, by, its, concentration, in, a, number, of, water, insoluble, ores, often, combined, with, sulfur, in, the, same, way, as, copper, with, which, it, is, often, found, though, molybdenum, is, found, in, such, minerals, as, wulfenite, pbmoo, 4, and, powellite, camoo, 4, the, main, commercial, source, is, molybdenite, mo, s, 2, molybdenum, is, mined, as, a, principal, ore, and, is, also, recovered, as, a, byproduct, of, copper, and, tungsten, mining, the, world, s, production, of, molybdenum, was, 250, 000, tonnes, in, 2011, the, largest, producers, being, china, 94, 000, t, the, united, states, 64, 000, t, chile, 38, 000, t, peru, 18, 000, t, and, mexico, 12, 000, t, the, total, reserves, are, estimated, at, 10, million, tonnes, and, are, mostly, concentrated, in, china, 4, 3, mt, the, us, 2, 7, mt, and, chile, 1, 2, mt, by, continent, 93, of, world, molybdenum, production, is, about, evenly, shared, between, north, america, south, america, mainly, in, chile, and, china, europe, and, the, rest, of, asia, mostly, armenia, russia, iran, and, mongolia, produce, the, remainder, in, molybdenite, processing, the, ore, is, first, roasted, in, air, at, a, temperature, of, 700, c, 1, 292, f, the, process, gives, gaseous, sulfur, dioxide, and, the, molybdenum, vi, oxide, the, resulting, oxide, is, then, usually, extracted, with, aqueous, ammonia, to, give, ammonium, molybdate, copper, an, impurity, in, molybdenite, is, separated, at, this, stage, by, treatment, with, hydrogen, sulfide, ammonium, molybdate, converts, to, ammonium, dimolybdate, which, is, isolated, as, a, solid, heating, this, solid, gives, molybdenum, trioxide, crude, trioxide, can, be, further, purified, by, sublimation, at, 1, 100, c, 2, 010, f, metallic, molybdenum, is, produced, by, reduction, of, the, oxide, with, hydrogen, the, molybdenum, for, steel, production, is, reduced, by, the, aluminothermic, reaction, with, addition, of, iron, to, produce, ferromolybdenum, a, common, form, of, ferromolybdenum, contains, 60, molybdenum, molybdenum, had, a, value, of, approximately, 30, 000, per, tonne, as, of, august, 2009, it, maintained, a, price, at, or, near, 10, 000, per, tonne, from, 1997, through, 2003, and, reached, a, peak, of, 103, 000, per, tonne, in, june, 2005, in, 2008, the, london, metal, exchange, announced, that, molybdenum, would, be, traded, as, a, commodity, the, knaben, mine, in, southern, norway, opened, in, 1885, was, the, first, dedicated, molybdenum, mine, closed, in, 1973, but, reopened, in, 2007, it, now, produces, 100, 000, kilograms, 98, long, tons, 110, short, tons, of, molybdenum, disulfide, per, year, large, mines, in, colorado, such, as, the, henderson, mine, and, the, climax, mine, and, in, british, columbia, yield, molybdenite, as, their, primary, product, while, many, porphyry, copper, deposits, such, as, the, bingham, canyon, mine, in, utah, and, the, chuquicamata, mine, in, northern, chile, produce, molybdenum, as, a, byproduct, of, copper, mining, about, 86, of, molybdenum, produced, is, used, in, metallurgy, with, the, rest, used, in, chemical, applications, the, estimated, global, use, is, structural, steel, 35, stainless, steel, 25, chemicals, 14, tool, high, speed, steels, 9, cast, iron, 6, molybdenum, elemental, metal, 6, and, superalloys, 5, molybdenum, can, withstand, extreme, temperatures, without, significantly, expanding, or, softening, making, it, useful, in, environments, of, intense, heat, including, military, armor, aircraft, parts, electrical, contacts, industrial, motors, and, supports, for, filaments, in, light, bulbs, most, high, strength, steel, alloys, for, example, 41xx, steels, contain, 0, 25, to, 8, molybdenum, even, in, these, small, portions, more, than, 43, 000, tonnes, of, molybdenum, are, used, each, year, in, stainless, steels, tool, steels, cast, irons, and, high, temperature, superalloys, molybdenum, is, also, used, in, steel, alloys, for, its, high, corrosion, resistance, and, weldability, molybdenum, contributes, corrosion, resistance, to, type, 300, stainless, steels, specifically, type, 316, and, especially, so, in, the, so, called, superaustenitic, stainless, steels, such, as, alloy, al, 6xn, 254smo, and, 1925hmo, molybdenum, increases, lattice, strain, thus, increasing, the, energy, required, to, dissolve, iron, atoms, from, the, surface, molybdenum, is, also, used, to, enhance, the, corrosion, resistance, of, ferritic, for, example, grade, 444, and, martensitic, for, example, 1, 4122, and, 1, 4418, stainless, steels, because, of, its, lower, density, and, more, stable, price, molybdenum, is, sometimes, used, in, place, of, tungsten, an, example, is, the, m, series, of, high, speed, steels, such, as, m2, m4, and, m42, as, substitution, for, the, t, steel, series, which, contain, tungsten, molybdenum, can, also, be, used, as, a, flame, resistant, coating, for, other, metals, although, its, melting, point, is, 2, 623, c, 4, 753, f, molybdenum, rapidly, oxidizes, at, temperatures, above, 760, c, 1, 400, f, making, it, better, suited, for, use, in, vacuum, environments, tzm, mo, 99, ti, 0, 5, zr, 0, 08, and, some, c, is, a, corrosion, resisting, molybdenum, superalloy, that, resists, molten, fluoride, salts, at, temperatures, above, 1, 300, c, 2, 370, f, it, has, about, twice, the, strength, of, pure, mo, and, is, more, ductile, and, more, weldable, yet, in, tests, it, resisted, corrosion, of, a, standard, eutectic, salt, flibe, and, salt, vapors, used, in, molten, salt, reactors, for, 1100, hours, with, so, little, corrosion, that, it, was, difficult, to, measure, due, to, its, excellent, mechanical, properties, under, high, temperature, and, high, pressure, tzm, alloys, are, extensively, applied, in, the, military, industry, it, is, used, as, the, valve, body, of, torpedo, engines, rocket, nozzles, and, gas, pipelines, where, it, can, withstand, extreme, thermal, and, mechanical, stresses, it, is, also, used, as, radiation, shields, in, nuclear, applications, other, molybdenum, based, alloys, that, do, not, contain, iron, have, only, limited, applications, for, example, because, of, its, resistance, to, molten, zinc, both, pure, molybdenum, and, molybdenum, tungsten, alloys, 70, 30, are, used, for, piping, stirrers, and, pump, impellers, that, come, into, contact, with, molten, zinc, molybdenum, is, an, essential, element, in, most, organisms, a, 2008, research, paper, speculated, that, a, scarcity, of, molybdenum, in, the, earth, s, early, oceans, may, have, strongly, influenced, the, evolution, of, eukaryotic, life, which, includes, all, plants, and, animals, at, least, 50, molybdenum, containing, enzymes, have, been, identified, mostly, in, bacteria, those, enzymes, include, aldehyde, oxidase, sulfite, oxidase, and, xanthine, oxidase, with, one, exception, mo, in, proteins, is, bound, by, molybdopterin, to, give, the, molybdenum, cofactor, the, only, known, exception, is, nitrogenase, which, uses, the, femoco, cofactor, which, has, the, formula, fe, 7, mos, 9, c, in, terms, of, function, molybdoenzymes, catalyze, the, oxidation, and, sometimes, reduction, of, certain, small, molecules, in, the, process, of, regulating, nitrogen, sulfur, and, carbon, in, some, animals, and, in, humans, the, oxidation, of, xanthine, to, uric, acid, a, process, of, purine, catabolism, is, catalyzed, by, xanthine, oxidase, a, molybdenum, containing, enzyme, the, activity, of, xanthine, oxidase, is, directly, proportional, to, the, amount, of, molybdenum, in, the, body, an, extremely, high, concentration, of, molybdenum, reverses, the, trend, and, can, inhibit, purine, catabolism, and, other, processes, molybdenum, concentration, also, affects, protein, synthesis, metabolism, and, growth, mo, is, a, component, in, most, nitrogenases, among, molybdoenzymes, nitrogenases, are, unique, in, lacking, the, molybdopterin, nitrogenases, catalyze, the, production, of, ammonia, from, atmospheric, nitrogen, the, biosynthesis, of, the, femoco, active, site, is, highly, complex, molybdate, is, transported, in, the, body, as, moo, 4, 2, molybdenum, is, an, essential, trace, dietary, element, four, mammalian, mo, dependent, enzymes, are, known, all, of, them, harboring, a, pterin, based, molybdenum, cofactor, moco, in, their, active, site, sulfite, oxidase, xanthine, oxidoreductase, aldehyde, oxidase, and, mitochondrial, amidoxime, reductase, people, severely, deficient, in, molybdenum, have, poorly, functioning, sulfite, oxidase, and, are, prone, to, toxic, reactions, to, sulfites, in, foods, the, human, body, contains, about, 0, 07, mg, of, molybdenum, per, kilogram, of, body, weight, with, higher, concentrations, in, the, liver, and, kidneys, and, lower, in, the, vertebrae, molybdenum, is, also, present, within, human, tooth, enamel, and, may, help, prevent, its, decay, acute, toxicity, has, not, been, seen, in, humans, and, the, toxicity, depends, strongly, on, the, chemical, state, studies, on, rats, show, a, median, lethal, dose, ld, 50, as, low, as, 180, mg, kg, for, some, mo, compounds, although, human, toxicity, data, is, unavailable, animal, studies, have, shown, that, chronic, ingestion, of, more, than, 10, mg, day, of, molybdenum, can, cause, diarrhea, growth, retardation, infertility, low, birth, weight, and, gout, it, can, also, affect, the, lungs, kidneys, and, liver, sodium, tungstate, is, a, competitive, inhibitor, of, molybdenum, dietary, tungsten, reduces, the, concentration, of, molybdenum, in, tissues, low, soil, concentration, of, molybdenum, in, a, geographical, band, from, northern, china, to, iran, results, in, a, general, dietary, molybdenum, deficiency, and, is, associated, with, increased, rates, of, esophageal, cancer, compared, to, the, united, states, which, has, a, greater, supply, of, molybdenum, in, the, soil, people, living, in, those, areas, have, about, 16, times, greater, risk, for, esophageal, squamous, cell, carcinoma, molybdenum, deficiency, has, also, been, reported, as, a, consequence, of, non, molybdenum, supplemented, total, parenteral, nutrition, complete, intravenous, feeding, for, long, periods, of, time, it, results, in, high, blood, levels, of, sulfite, and, urate, in, much, the, same, way, as, molybdenum, cofactor, deficiency, since, pure, molybdenum, deficiency, from, this, cause, occurs, primarily, in, adults, the, neurological, consequences, are, not, as, marked, as, in, cases, of, congenital, cofactor, deficiency, a, congenital, molybdenum, cofactor, deficiency, disease, seen, in, infants, is, an, inability, to, synthesize, molybdenum, cofactor, the, heterocyclic, molecule, discussed, above, that, binds, molybdenum, at, the, active, site, in, all, known, human, enzymes, that, use, molybdenum, the, resulting, deficiency, results, in, high, levels, of, sulfite, and, urate, and, neurological, damage, most, molybdenum, is, excreted, from, the, human, body, as, molybdate, in, the, urine, furthermore, urinary, excretion, of, molybdenum, increases, as, dietary, molybdenum, intake, increases, small, amounts, of, molybdenum, are, excreted, from, the, body, in, the, feces, by, way, of, the, bile, small, amounts, also, can, be, lost, in, sweat, and, in, hair, high, levels, of, molybdenum, can, interfere, with, the, body, s, uptake, of, copper, producing, copper, deficiency, molybdenum, prevents, plasma, proteins, from, binding, to, copper, and, it, also, increases, the, amount, of, copper, that, is, excreted, in, urine, ruminants, that, consume, high, levels, of, molybdenum, suffer, from, diarrhea, stunted, growth, anemia, and, achromotrichia, loss, of, fur, pigment, these, symptoms, can, be, alleviated, by, copper, supplements, either, dietary, and, injection, the, effective, copper, deficiency, can, be, aggravated, by, excess, sulfur, copper, reduction, or, deficiency, can, also, be, deliberately, induced, for, therapeutic, purposes, by, the, compound, ammonium, tetrathiomolybdate, in, which, the, bright, red, anion, tetrathiomolybdate, is, the, copper, chelating, agent, tetrathiomolybdate, was, first, used, therapeutically, in, the, treatment, of, copper, toxicosis, in, animals, it, was, then, introduced, as, a, treatment, in, wilson, s, disease, a, hereditary, copper, metabolism, disorder, in, humans, it, acts, both, by, competing, with, copper, absorption, in, the, bowel, and, by, increasing, excretion, it, has, also, been, found, to, have, an, inhibitory, effect, on, angiogenesis, potentially, by, inhibiting, the, membrane, translocation, process, that, is, dependent, on, copper, ions, this, is, a, promising, avenue, for, investigation, of, treatments, for, cancer, age, related, macular, degeneration, and, other, diseases, that, involve, a, pathologic, proliferation, of, blood, vessels, in, some, grazing, livestock, most, strongly, in, cattle, molybdenum, excess, in, the, soil, of, pasturage, can, produce, scours, diarrhea, if, the, ph, of, the, soil, is, neutral, to, alkaline, see, teartness, molybdenum, targets, are, used, in, mammography, because, they, produce, x, rays, in, the, energy, range, of, 17, 20, kev, which, is, optimal, for, imaging, soft, tissues, like, the, breast, the, characteristic, x, rays, emitted, from, molybdenum, provide, high, contrast, between, different, types, of, tissues, allowing, for, the, effective, visualization, of, microcalcifications, and, other, subtle, abnormalities, in, breast, tissue, this, energy, range, also, minimizes, radiation, dose, while, maximizing, image, quality, making, molybdenum, targets, particularly, suitable, for, breast, cancer, screening, in, 2000, the, then, u, s, institute, of, medicine, now, the, national, academy, of, medicine, nam, updated, its, estimated, average, requirements, ears, and, recommended, dietary, allowances, rdas, for, molybdenum, if, there, is, not, sufficient, information,
