a, ring, system, is, a, disc, or, torus, orbiting, an, astronomical, object, that, is, composed, of, solid, material, such, as, gas, dust, meteoroids, planetoids, or, moonlets, and, stellar, objects, ring, systems, are, best, known, as, planetary, rings, common, components, of, satellite, systems, around, giant, planets, such, as, of, saturn, or, circumplanetary, disks, but, they, can, also, be, galactic, rings, and, circumstellar, discs, belts, of, planetoids, such, as, the, asteroid, belt, or, kuiper, belt, or, rings, of, interplanetary, dust, such, as, around, the, sun, at, distances, of, mercury, venus, and, earth, in, mean, motion, resonance, with, these, planets, evidence, suggests, that, ring, systems, may, also, be, found, around, other, types, of, astronomical, objects, including, moons, and, brown, dwarfs, in, the, solar, system, all, four, giant, planets, jupiter, saturn, uranus, and, neptune, have, ring, systems, ring, systems, around, minor, planets, have, also, been, discovered, via, occultations, there, are, three, ways, that, thicker, planetary, rings, have, been, proposed, to, have, formed, from, material, originating, from, the, protoplanetary, disk, that, was, within, the, roche, limit, of, the, planet, and, thus, could, not, coalesce, to, form, moons, from, the, debris, of, a, moon, that, was, disrupted, by, a, large, impact, or, from, the, debris, of, a, moon, that, was, disrupted, by, tidal, stresses, when, it, passed, within, the, planet, s, roche, limit, most, rings, were, thought, to, be, unstable, and, to, dissipate, over, the, course, of, tens, or, hundreds, of, millions, of, years, but, it, now, appears, that, saturn, s, rings, might, be, quite, old, dating, to, the, early, days, of, the, solar, system, fainter, planetary, rings, can, form, as, a, result, of, meteoroid, impacts, with, moons, orbiting, around, the, planet, or, in, the, case, of, saturn, s, e, ring, the, ejecta, of, cryovolcanic, material, ring, systems, may, form, around, centaurs, when, they, are, tidally, disrupted, in, a, close, encounter, within, 0, 4, to, 0, 8, times, the, roche, limit, with, a, giant, planet, for, a, differentiated, body, approaching, a, giant, planet, at, an, initial, relative, velocity, of, 3, 6, km, s, with, an, initial, rotational, period, of, 8, hours, a, ring, mass, of, 0, 1, 10, of, the, centaur, s, mass, is, predicted, ring, formation, from, an, undifferentiated, body, is, less, likely, the, rings, would, be, composed, mostly, or, entirely, of, material, from, the, parent, body, s, icy, mantle, after, forming, the, ring, would, spread, laterally, leading, to, satellite, formation, from, whatever, portion, of, it, spreads, beyond, the, centaur, s, roche, limit, satellites, could, also, form, directly, from, the, disrupted, icy, mantle, this, formation, mechanism, predicts, that, roughly, 10, of, centaurs, will, have, experienced, potentially, ring, forming, encounters, with, giant, planets, the, composition, of, planetary, ring, particles, varies, ranging, from, silicates, to, icy, dust, larger, rocks, and, boulders, may, also, be, present, and, in, 2007, tidal, effects, from, eight, moonlets, only, a, few, hundred, meters, across, were, detected, within, saturn, s, rings, the, maximum, size, of, a, ring, particle, is, determined, by, the, specific, strength, of, the, material, it, is, made, of, its, density, and, the, tidal, force, at, its, altitude, the, tidal, force, is, proportional, to, the, average, density, inside, the, radius, of, the, ring, or, to, the, mass, of, the, planet, divided, by, the, radius, of, the, ring, cubed, it, is, also, inversely, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, orbital, period, of, the, ring, some, planetary, rings, are, influenced, by, shepherd, moons, small, moons, that, orbit, near, the, inner, or, outer, edges, of, a, ringlet, or, within, gaps, in, the, rings, the, gravity, of, shepherd, moons, serves, to, maintain, a, sharply, defined, edge, to, the, ring, material, that, drifts, closer, to, the, shepherd, moon, s, orbit, is, either, deflected, back, into, the, body, of, the, ring, ejected, from, the, system, or, accreted, onto, the, moon, itself, it, is, also, predicted, that, phobos, a, moon, of, mars, will, break, up, and, form, into, a, planetary, ring, in, about, 50, million, years, its, low, orbit, with, an, orbital, period, that, is, shorter, than, a, martian, day, is, decaying, due, to, tidal, deceleration, jupiter, s, ring, system, was, the, third, to, be, discovered, when, it, was, first, observed, by, the, voyager, 1, probe, in, 1979, and, was, observed, more, thoroughly, by, the, galileo, orbiter, in, the, 1990s, its, four, main, parts, are, a, faint, thick, torus, known, as, the, halo, a, thin, relatively, bright, main, ring, and, two, wide, faint, gossamer, rings, the, system, consists, mostly, of, dust, saturn, s, rings, are, the, most, extensive, ring, system, of, any, planet, in, the, solar, system, and, thus, have, been, known, to, exist, for, quite, some, time, galileo, galilei, first, observed, them, in, 1610, but, they, were, not, accurately, described, as, a, disk, around, saturn, until, christiaan, huygens, did, so, in, 1655, the, rings, are, not, a, series, of, tiny, ringlets, as, many, think, but, are, more, of, a, disk, with, varying, density, they, consist, mostly, of, water, ice, and, trace, amounts, of, rock, and, the, particles, range, in, size, from, micrometers, to, meters, uranus, s, ring, system, lies, between, the, level, of, complexity, of, saturn, s, vast, system, and, the, simpler, systems, around, jupiter, and, neptune, they, were, discovered, in, 1977, by, james, l, elliot, edward, w, dunham, and, jessica, mink, in, the, time, between, then, and, 2005, observations, by, voyager, 2, and, the, hubble, space, telescope, led, to, a, total, of, 13, distinct, rings, being, identified, most, of, which, are, opaque, and, only, a, few, kilometers, wide, they, are, dark, and, likely, consist, of, water, ice, and, some, radiation, processed, organics, the, relative, lack, of, dust, is, due, to, aerodynamic, drag, from, the, extended, exosphere, corona, of, uranus, the, system, around, neptune, consists, of, five, principal, rings, that, at, their, densest, are, comparable, to, the, low, density, regions, of, saturn, s, rings, however, they, are, faint, and, dusty, much, more, similar, in, structure, to, those, of, jupiter, the, very, dark, material, that, makes, up, the, rings, is, likely, organics, processed, by, radiation, like, in, the, rings, of, uranus, 20, to, 70, percent, of, the, rings, are, dust, a, relatively, high, proportion, hints, of, the, rings, were, seen, for, decades, prior, to, their, conclusive, discovery, by, voyager, 2, in, 1989, reports, in, march, 2008, suggested, that, saturn, s, moon, rhea, may, have, its, own, tenuous, ring, system, which, would, make, it, the, only, moon, known, to, have, a, ring, system, a, later, study, published, in, 2010, revealed, that, imaging, of, rhea, by, the, cassini, spacecraft, was, inconsistent, with, the, predicted, properties, of, the, rings, suggesting, that, some, other, mechanism, is, responsible, for, the, magnetic, effects, that, had, led, to, the, ring, hypothesis, prior, to, the, arrival, of, new, horizons, some, astronomers, hypothesized, that, pluto, and, charon, might, have, a, circumbinary, ring, system, created, from, dust, ejected, off, of, pluto, s, small, outer, moons, in, impacts, a, dust, ring, would, have, posed, a, considerable, risk, to, the, new, horizons, spacecraft, however, this, possibility, was, ruled, out, when, new, horizons, failed, to, detect, any, dust, rings, around, pluto, 10199, chariklo, a, centaur, was, the, first, minor, planet, discovered, to, have, rings, it, has, two, rings, perhaps, due, to, a, collision, that, caused, a, chain, of, debris, to, orbit, it, the, rings, were, discovered, when, astronomers, observed, chariklo, passing, in, front, of, the, star, ucac4, 248, 108672, on, june, 3, 2013, from, seven, locations, in, south, america, while, watching, they, saw, two, dips, in, the, star, s, apparent, brightness, just, before, and, after, the, occultation, because, this, event, was, observed, at, multiple, locations, the, conclusion, that, the, dip, in, brightness, was, in, fact, due, to, rings, is, unanimously, the, leading, hypothesis, the, observations, revealed, what, is, likely, a, 19, kilometer, 12, mile, wide, ring, system, that, is, about, 1, 000, times, closer, than, the, moon, is, to, earth, in, addition, astronomers, suspect, there, could, be, a, moon, orbiting, amidst, the, ring, debris, if, these, rings, are, the, leftovers, of, a, collision, as, astronomers, suspect, this, would, give, fodder, to, the, idea, that, moons, such, as, the, moon, form, through, collisions, of, smaller, bits, of, material, chariklo, s, rings, have, not, been, officially, named, but, the, discoverers, have, nicknamed, them, oiapoque, and, chu, after, two, rivers, near, the, northern, and, southern, ends, of, brazil, a, second, centaur, 2060, chiron, has, a, constantly, evolving, disk, of, rings, based, on, stellar, occultation, data, that, were, initially, interpreted, as, resulting, from, jets, associated, with, chiron, s, comet, like, activity, the, rings, are, proposed, to, be, 324, 10, km, in, radius, though, their, evolution, does, change, the, radius, somewhat, their, changing, appearance, at, different, viewing, angles, can, explain, the, long, term, variation, in, chiron, s, brightness, over, time, chiron, s, rings, are, suspected, to, be, maintained, by, orbiting, material, ejected, during, seasonal, outbursts, as, a, third, partial, ring, detected, in, 2018, had, become, a, full, ring, by, 2022, with, an, outburst, in, between, in, 2021, a, ring, around, haumea, a, dwarf, planet, and, resonant, kuiper, belt, member, was, revealed, by, a, stellar, occultation, observed, on, 21, january, 2017, this, makes, it, the, first, trans, neptunian, object, found, to, have, a, ring, system, the, ring, has, a, radius, of, about, 2, 287, km, a, width, of, 70, km, and, an, opacity, of, 0, 5, the, ring, plane, coincides, with, haumea, s, equator, and, the, orbit, of, its, larger, outer, moon, hi, iaka, which, has, a, semimajor, axis, of, 25, 657, km, the, ring, is, close, to, the, 3, 1, resonance, with, haumea, s, rotation, which, is, located, at, a, radius, of, 2, 285, 8, km, it, is, well, within, haumea, s, roche, limit, which, would, lie, at, a, radius, of, about, 4, 400, km, if, haumea, were, spherical, being, nonspherical, pushes, the, limit, out, farther, in, 2023, astronomers, announced, the, discovery, of, a, widely, separated, ring, around, the, dwarf, planet, and, kuiper, belt, object, quaoar, further, analysis, of, the, occultation, data, uncovered, a, second, inner, fainter, ring, both, rings, display, unusual, properties, the, outer, ring, orbits, at, a, distance, of, 4, 057, 6, km, approximately, 7, 5, times, the, radius, of, quaoar, and, more, than, double, the, distance, of, its, roche, limit, the, inner, ring, orbits, at, a, distance, of, 2, 520, 20, km, approximately, 4, 6, times, the, radius, of, quaoar, and, also, beyond, its, roche, limit, the, outer, ring, appears, to, be, inhomogeneous, containing, a, thin, dense, section, as, well, as, a, broader, more, diffuse, section, because, all, giant, planets, of, the, solar, system, have, rings, the, existence, of, exoplanets, with, rings, is, plausible, although, particles, of, ice, the, material, that, is, predominant, in, the, rings, of, saturn, can, only, exist, around, planets, beyond, the, frost, line, within, this, line, rings, consisting, of, rocky, material, can, be, stable, in, the, long, term, such, ring, systems, can, be, detected, for, planets, observed, by, the, transit, method, by, additional, reduction, of, the, light, of, the, central, star, if, their, opacity, is, sufficient, as, of, 2024, two, candidate, extrasolar, ring, systems, have, been, found, by, this, method, around, hip, 41378, f, and, k2, 33b, fomalhaut, b, was, found, to, be, large, and, unclearly, defined, when, detected, in, 2008, this, was, hypothesized, to, either, be, due, to, a, cloud, of, dust, attracted, from, the, dust, disc, of, the, star, or, a, possible, ring, system, though, in, 2020, fomalhaut, b, itself, was, determined, to, very, likely, be, an, expanding, debris, cloud, from, a, collision, of, asteroids, rather, than, a, planet, similarly, proxima, centauri, c, has, been, observed, to, be, far, brighter, than, expected, for, its, low, mass, of, 7, earth, masses, which, may, be, attributed, to, a, ring, system, of, about, 5, r, j, a, 56, day, long, sequence, of, dimming, events, in, the, star, v1400, centauri, observed, in, 2007, was, interpreted, as, a, substellar, object, with, a, circumstellar, disk, or, massive, rings, transiting, the, star, this, substellar, object, dubbed, j1407b, is, most, likely, a, free, floating, brown, dwarf, or, rogue, planet, several, times, the, mass, of, jupiter, the, circumstellar, disk, or, ring, system, of, j1407b, is, about, 0, 6, astronomical, units, 90, 000, 000, km, 56, 000, 000, mi, in, radius, j1407b, s, transit, of, v1400, centauri, revealed, gaps, and, density, variations, within, its, disk, or, ring, system, which, has, been, interpreted, as, hints, of, exomoons, or, exoplanets, forming, around, j1407b, solar, system, local, interstellar, cloud, local, bubble, gould, belt, orion, arm, milky, way, milky, way, subgroup, local, group, local, sheet, virgo, supercluster, laniakea, supercluster,
