technetium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, tc, and, atomic, number, 43, it, is, the, lightest, element, whose, isotopes, are, all, radioactive, technetium, and, promethium, are, the, only, radioactive, elements, whose, neighbours, in, the, sense, of, atomic, number, are, both, stable, all, available, technetium, is, produced, as, a, synthetic, element, naturally, occurring, technetium, is, a, spontaneous, fission, product, in, uranium, ore, and, thorium, ore, the, most, common, source, or, the, product, of, neutron, capture, in, molybdenum, ores, this, silvery, gray, crystalline, transition, metal, lies, between, manganese, and, rhenium, in, group, 7, of, the, periodic, table, and, its, chemical, properties, are, intermediate, between, those, of, both, adjacent, elements, the, most, common, naturally, occurring, isotope, is, 99, tc, in, traces, only, many, of, technetium, s, properties, had, been, predicted, by, dmitri, mendeleev, before, it, was, discovered, mendeleev, noted, a, gap, in, his, periodic, table, and, gave, the, undiscovered, element, the, provisional, name, ekamanganese, em, in, 1937, technetium, became, the, first, predominantly, artificial, element, to, be, produced, hence, its, name, from, the, greek, technetos, artificial, ium, one, short, lived, gamma, ray, emitting, nuclear, isomer, technetium, 99m, is, used, in, nuclear, medicine, for, a, wide, variety, of, tests, such, as, bone, cancer, diagnoses, the, ground, state, of, the, nuclide, technetium, 99, is, used, as, a, gamma, ray, free, source, of, beta, particles, long, lived, technetium, isotopes, produced, commercially, are, byproducts, of, the, fission, of, uranium, 235, in, nuclear, reactors, and, are, extracted, from, nuclear, fuel, rods, because, even, the, longest, lived, isotope, of, technetium, has, a, relatively, short, half, life, 4, 21, million, years, the, 1952, detection, of, technetium, in, red, giants, helped, to, prove, that, stars, can, produce, heavier, elements, from, the, 1860s, through, 1871, early, forms, of, the, periodic, table, proposed, by, dmitri, mendeleev, contained, a, gap, between, molybdenum, element, 42, and, ruthenium, element, 44, in, 1871, mendeleev, predicted, this, missing, element, would, occupy, the, empty, place, below, manganese, and, have, similar, chemical, properties, mendeleev, gave, it, the, provisional, name, eka, manganese, from, eka, the, sanskrit, word, for, one, because, it, was, one, place, down, from, the, known, element, manganese, many, early, researchers, both, before, and, after, the, periodic, table, was, published, were, eager, to, be, the, first, to, discover, and, name, the, missing, element, its, location, in, the, table, suggested, that, it, should, be, easier, to, find, than, other, undiscovered, elements, this, turned, out, not, to, be, the, case, due, to, technetium, s, radioactivity, german, chemists, walter, noddack, otto, berg, and, ida, tacke, reported, the, discovery, of, element, 75, and, element, 43, in, 1925, and, named, element, 43, masurium, after, masuria, in, eastern, prussia, now, in, poland, the, region, where, walter, noddack, s, family, originated, this, name, caused, significant, resentment, in, the, scientific, community, because, it, was, interpreted, as, referring, to, a, series, of, victories, of, the, german, army, over, the, russian, army, in, the, masuria, region, during, world, war, i, as, the, noddacks, remained, in, their, academic, positions, while, the, nazis, were, in, power, suspicions, and, hostility, against, their, claim, for, discovering, element, 43, continued, the, group, bombarded, columbite, with, a, beam, of, electrons, and, deduced, element, 43, was, present, by, examining, x, ray, emission, spectrograms, the, wavelength, of, the, x, rays, produced, is, related, to, the, atomic, number, by, a, formula, derived, by, henry, moseley, in, 1913, the, team, claimed, to, detect, a, faint, x, ray, signal, at, a, wavelength, produced, by, element, 43, later, experimenters, could, not, replicate, the, discovery, and, it, was, dismissed, as, an, error, still, in, 1933, a, series, of, articles, on, the, discovery, of, elements, quoted, the, name, masurium, for, element, 43, some, more, recent, attempts, have, been, made, to, rehabilitate, the, noddacks, claims, but, they, are, disproved, by, paul, kuroda, s, study, on, the, amount, of, technetium, that, could, have, been, present, in, the, ores, they, studied, it, could, not, have, exceeded, 3, 10, 11, g, kg, of, ore, and, thus, would, have, been, undetectable, by, the, noddacks, methods, the, discovery, of, element, 43, was, finally, confirmed, in, a, 1937, experiment, at, the, university, of, palermo, in, sicily, by, carlo, perrier, and, emilio, segr, in, mid, 1936, segr, visited, the, united, states, first, columbia, university, in, new, york, and, then, the, lawrence, berkeley, national, laboratory, in, california, he, persuaded, cyclotron, inventor, ernest, lawrence, to, let, him, take, back, some, discarded, cyclotron, parts, that, had, become, radioactive, lawrence, mailed, him, a, molybdenum, foil, that, had, been, part, of, the, deflector, in, the, cyclotron, segr, enlisted, his, colleague, perrier, to, attempt, to, prove, through, comparative, chemistry, that, the, molybdenum, activity, was, indeed, from, an, element, with, the, atomic, number, 43, in, 1937, they, succeeded, in, isolating, the, isotopes, technetium, 95m, and, technetium, 97, university, of, palermo, officials, wanted, them, to, name, their, discovery, panormium, after, the, latin, name, for, palermo, panormus, in, 1947, element, 43, was, named, after, the, greek, word, technetos, meaning, artificial, since, it, was, the, first, element, to, be, artificially, produced, segr, returned, to, berkeley, and, met, glenn, t, seaborg, they, isolated, the, metastable, isotope, technetium, 99m, which, is, now, used, in, some, ten, million, medical, diagnostic, procedures, annually, in, 1952, the, astronomer, paul, w, merrill, in, california, detected, the, spectral, signature, of, technetium, specifically, wavelengths, of, 403, 1, nm, 423, 8, nm, 426, 2, nm, and, 429, 7, nm, in, light, from, s, type, red, giants, the, stars, were, near, the, end, of, their, lives, but, were, rich, in, the, short, lived, element, which, indicated, that, it, was, being, produced, in, the, stars, by, nuclear, reactions, that, evidence, bolstered, the, hypothesis, that, heavier, elements, are, the, product, of, nucleosynthesis, in, stars, more, recently, such, observations, provided, evidence, that, elements, are, formed, by, neutron, capture, in, the, s, process, since, that, discovery, there, have, been, many, searches, in, terrestrial, materials, for, natural, sources, of, technetium, in, 1962, technetium, 99, was, isolated, and, identified, in, pitchblende, from, the, belgian, congo, in, very, small, quantities, about, 0, 2, ng, kg, where, it, originates, as, a, spontaneous, fission, product, of, uranium, 238, the, natural, nuclear, fission, reactor, in, oklo, contains, evidence, that, significant, amounts, of, technetium, 99, were, produced, and, have, since, decayed, into, ruthenium, 99, technetium, is, a, silvery, gray, radioactive, metal, with, an, appearance, similar, to, platinum, commonly, obtained, as, a, gray, powder, the, crystal, structure, of, the, bulk, pure, metal, is, hexagonal, close, packed, and, crystal, structures, of, the, nanodisperse, pure, metal, are, cubic, nanodisperse, technetium, does, not, have, a, split, nmr, spectrum, while, hexagonal, bulk, technetium, has, the, tc, 99, nmr, spectrum, split, in, 9, satellites, atomic, technetium, has, characteristic, emission, lines, at, wavelengths, of, 363, 3, nm, 403, 1, nm, 426, 2, nm, 429, 7, nm, and, 485, 3, nm, the, unit, cell, parameters, of, the, orthorhombic, tc, metal, were, reported, when, tc, is, contaminated, with, carbon, a, 0, 2805, 4, b, 0, 4958, 8, c, 0, 4474, 5, nm, for, tc, c, with, 1, 38, wt, c, and, a, 0, 2815, 4, b, 0, 4963, 8, c, 0, 4482, 5, nm, for, tc, c, with, 1, 96, wt, c, the, metal, form, is, slightly, paramagnetic, meaning, its, magnetic, dipoles, align, with, external, magnetic, fields, but, will, assume, random, orientations, once, the, field, is, removed, pure, metallic, single, crystal, technetium, becomes, a, type, ii, superconductor, at, temperatures, below, 7, 46, k, below, this, temperature, technetium, has, a, very, high, magnetic, penetration, depth, greater, than, any, other, element, except, niobium, technetium, is, located, in, the, seventh, group, of, the, periodic, table, between, rhenium, and, manganese, as, predicted, by, the, periodic, law, its, chemical, properties, are, between, those, two, elements, of, the, two, technetium, more, closely, resembles, rhenium, particularly, in, its, chemical, inertness, and, tendency, to, form, covalent, bonds, this, is, consistent, with, the, tendency, of, period, 5, elements, to, resemble, their, counterparts, in, period, 6, more, than, period, 4, due, to, the, lanthanide, contraction, unlike, manganese, technetium, does, not, readily, form, cations, ions, with, net, positive, charge, technetium, exhibits, nine, oxidation, states, from, 1, to, 7, with, 4, 5, and, 7, being, the, most, common, technetium, dissolves, in, aqua, regia, nitric, acid, and, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, but, not, in, hydrochloric, acid, of, any, concentration, metallic, technetium, slowly, tarnishes, in, moist, air, and, in, powder, form, burns, in, oxygen, when, reacting, with, hydrogen, at, high, pressure, it, forms, the, hydride, tch, 1, 3, and, while, reacting, with, carbon, it, forms, tc, 6, c, with, cell, parameter, 3, 98, as, well, as, the, nanodisperce, low, carbon, content, carbide, with, parameter, 4, 02, technetium, can, catalyse, the, destruction, of, hydrazine, by, nitric, acid, and, this, property, is, due, to, its, multiplicity, of, valencies, this, caused, a, problem, in, the, separation, of, plutonium, from, uranium, in, nuclear, fuel, processing, where, hydrazine, is, used, as, a, protective, reductant, to, keep, plutonium, in, the, trivalent, rather, than, the, more, stable, tetravalent, state, the, problem, was, exacerbated, by, the, mutually, enhanced, solvent, extraction, of, technetium, and, zirconium, at, the, previous, stage, and, required, a, process, modification, the, most, prevalent, form, of, technetium, that, is, easily, accessible, is, sodium, pertechnetate, na, the, majority, of, this, material, is, produced, by, radioactive, decay, from, 2, pertechnetate, tco, 4, is, only, weakly, hydrated, in, aqueous, solutions, and, it, behaves, analogously, to, perchlorate, anion, both, of, which, are, tetrahedral, unlike, permanganate, mno, 4, it, is, only, a, weak, oxidizing, agent, related, to, pertechnetate, is, technetium, heptoxide, this, pale, yellow, volatile, solid, is, produced, by, oxidation, of, tc, metal, and, related, precursors, it, is, a, molecular, metal, oxide, analogous, to, manganese, heptoxide, it, adopts, a, centrosymmetric, structure, with, two, types, of, tc, o, bonds, with, 167, and, 184, pm, bond, lengths, technetium, heptoxide, hydrolyzes, to, pertechnetate, and, pertechnetic, acid, depending, on, the, ph, htco, 4, is, a, strong, acid, in, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, converts, to, the, octahedral, form, tco, 3, oh, h, 2, o, 2, the, conjugate, base, of, the, hypothetical, tri, aquo, complex, technetium, forms, a, dioxide, disulfide, di, selenide, and, di, telluride, an, ill, defined, tc, 2, s, 7, forms, upon, treating, pertechnate, with, hydrogen, sulfide, it, thermally, decomposes, into, disulfide, and, elemental, sulfur, similarly, the, dioxide, can, be, produced, by, reduction, of, the, tc, 2, o, 7, unlike, the, case, for, rhenium, a, trioxide, has, not, been, isolated, for, technetium, however, tco, 3, has, been, identified, in, the, gas, phase, using, mass, spectrometry, technetium, forms, the, complex, tch, 2, 9, the, potassium, salt, is, isostructural, with, reh, 2, 9, at, high, pressure, formation, of, tch1, 3, from, elements, was, also, reported, the, following, binary, containing, only, two, elements, technetium, halides,

prominent, complex, being, which, are, unusual, compared, to, other, metal, carbonyls, technetium, with, atomic, number, z, 43, is, the, lowest, numbered, element, in, the, periodic, table, for, which, all, isotopes, are, radioactive, the, second, lightest, exclusively, radioactive, element, promethium, has, atomic, number, 61, atomic, nuclei, with, an, odd, number, of, protons, are, less, stable, than, those, with, even, numbers, even, when, the, total, number, of, nucleons, protons, neutrons, is, even, and, odd, numbered, elements, have, fewer, stable, isotopes, the, most, stable, radioactive, isotopes, are, technetium, 97, with, a, half, life, of, 4, 21, 0, 16, million, years, and, technetium, 98, with, 4, 2, 0, 3, million, years, current, measurements, of, their, half, lives, give, overlapping, confidence, intervals, corresponding, to, one, standard, deviation, and, therefore, do, not, allow, a, definite, assignment, of, technetium, s, most, stable, isotope, the, next, most, stable, isotope, is, technetium, 99, which, has, a, half, life, of, 211, 100, years, thirty, four, other, radioisotopes, have, been, characterized, with, mass, numbers, ranging, from, 86, to,

naturally, in, the, earth, s, crust, in, minute, concentrations, of, about, 0, 003, parts, per, trillion, technetium, is, so, rare, because, the, half, lives, of, 97, tc, and, 98, tc, are, only, 4, 2, million, years, more, than, a, thousand, of, such, periods, have, passed, since, the, formation, of, the, earth, so, the, probability, of, survival, of, even, one, atom, of, primordial, technetium, is, effectively, zero, however, small, amounts, exist, as, spontaneous, fission, products, in, uranium, ores, a, kilogram, of, uranium, contains, an, estimated, 1, nanogram, 10, 9, g, equivalent, to, ten, trillion, atoms, of, technetium, some, red, giant, stars, with, the, spectral, types, s, m, and, n, display, a, spectral, absorption, line, indicating, the, presence, of, technetium, these, red,

commercially, technetium, 99, is, produced, by, the, nuclear, fission, of, both, uranium, 235, and, plutonium, 239, it, is, therefore, present, in, radioactive, waste, and, in, the, nuclear, fallout, of, fission, bomb, explosions, its, decay, measured, in, becquerels, per, amount, of, spent, fuel, is, the, dominant, contributor, to, nuclear, waste, radioactivity, after, about, 10, 4, to, 10, 6,

99m, half, life, 6, hours, which, results, from, its, decay, is, being, constantly, produced, the, soluble, pertechnetate, tco, 4, can, then, be, chemically, extracted, by, elution, using, a, saline, solution, a, drawback, of, this, process, is, that, it, requires, targets, containing, uranium, 235, which, are, subject, to, the, security, precautions, of, fissile, materials, almost, two, thirds, of, the, world, s, supply, comes, from, two, reactors, the, national, research, universal, reactor, at, chalk, river, laboratories, in, ontario, canada, and, the, high, flux, reactor, at, nuclear, research, and, consultancy, group, in, petten, netherlands, all, major, reactors, that, produce, technetium, 99m, were, built, in, the, 1960s, and, are, close, to, the, end, of, life, the, two, new, canadian, multipurpose, applied, physics, lattice, experiment, reactors, planned, and, built, to, produce, 200, of, the, demand, of, technetium, 99m, relieved, all, other, producers, from, building, their, own, reactors, with, the, cancellation, of, the, already, tested, reactors, in, 2008, the, future, supply, of, technetium, 99m, became, problematic, the, long, half, life, of, technetium, 99, and, its, potential, to, form, anionic, species, creates, a, major, concern, for, long, term, disposal, of, radioactive, waste, many, of, the, processes, designed, to, remove, fission, products, in, reprocessing, plants, aim, at, cationic, species, such, as, caesium, e, g, caesium, 137, and, strontium, e, g, strontium, 90, hence, the, pertechnetate, escapes, through, those, processes, current, disposal, options, favor, burial, in, continental, geologically, stable, rock, the, primary, danger, with, such, practice, is, the, likelihood, that, the, waste, will, contact, water, which, could, leach, radioactive, contamination, into, the, environment, the, anionic, pertechnetate, and, iodide, tend, not, to, adsorb, into, the, surfaces, of, minerals, and, are, likely, to, be, washed, away, by, comparison, plutonium, uranium, and, caesium, tend, to, bind, to, soil, particles, technetium, could, be, immobilized, by, some, environments, such, as, microbial, activity, in, lake, bottom, sediments, and, the, environmental, chemistry, of, technetium, is, an, area, of, active, research, an, alternative, disposal, method, transmutation, has, been, demonstrated, at, cern, for, technetium, 99, in, this, process, the, technetium, technetium, 99, as, a, metal, target, is, bombarded, with, neutrons, to, form, the, short, lived, technetium, 100, half, life, 16, seconds, which, decays, by, beta, decay, to, stable, ruthenium, 100, if, recovery, of, usable, ruthenium, is, a, goal, an, extremely, pure, technetium, target, is, needed, if, small, traces, of, the, minor, actinides, such, as, americium, and, curium, are, present, in, the, target, they, are, likely, to, undergo, fission, and, form, more, fission, products, which, increase, the, radioactivity, of, the, irradiated, target, the, formation, of, ruthenium, 106, half, life, 374, days, from, the, fresh, fission, is, likely, to, increase, the, activity, of, the, final, ruthenium, metal, which, will, then, require, a, longer, cooling, time, after, irradiation, before, the, ruthenium, can, be, used, the, actual, separation, of, technetium, 99, from, spent, nuclear, fuel, is, a, long, process, during, fuel, reprocessing, it, comes, out, as, a, component, of, the, highly, radioactive, waste, liquid, after, sitting, for, several, years, the, radioactivity, reduces, to, a, level, where, extraction, of, the, long, lived, isotopes, including, technetium, 99, becomes, feasible, a, series, of, chemical, processes, yields, technetium, 99, metal, of, high, purity, molybdenum, 99, which, decays, to, form, technetium, 99m, can, be, formed, by, the, neutron, activation, of, molybdenum, 98, when, needed, other, technetium, isotopes, are, not, produced, in, significant, quantities, by, fission, but, are, manufactured, by, neutron, irradiation, of, parent, isotopes, for, example, technetium, 97, can, be, made, by, neutron, irradiation, of, ruthenium, 96, the, feasibility, of, technetium, 99m, production, with, the, 22, mev, proton, bombardment, of, a, molybdenum, 100, target, in, medical, cyclotrons, following, the, reaction, 100, mo, p, 2n, 99m, tc, was, demonstrated, in, 1971, the, recent, shortages, of, medical, technetium, 99m, reignited, the, interest, in, its, production, by, proton, bombardment, of, isotopically, enriched, 99, 5, molybdenum, 100, targets, other, techniques, are, being, investigated, for, obtaining, molybdenum, 99, from, molybdenum, 100, via, n, 2n, or, n, reactions, in, particle, accelerators, technetium, 99m, m, indicates, that, this, is, a, metastable, nuclear, isomer, is, used, in, radioactive, isotope, medical, tests, for, example, technetium, 99m, is, a, radioactive, tracer, that, medical, imaging, equipment, tracks, in, the, human, body, it, is, well, suited, to, the, role, because, it, emits, readily, detectable, 140, kev, gamma, rays, and, its, half, life, is, 6, 01, hours, meaning, that, about, 94, of, it, decays, to, technetium, 99, in, 24, hours, the, chemistry, of, technetium, allows, it, to, be, bound, to, a, variety, of, biochemical, compounds, each, of, which, determines, how, it, is, metabolized, and, deposited, in, the, body, and, this, single, isotope, can, be, used, for, a, multitude, of, diagnostic, tests, more, than, 50, common, radiopharmaceuticals, are, based, on, technetium, 99m, for, imaging, and, functional, studies, of, the, brain, heart, muscle, thyroid, lungs, liver, gall, bladder, kidneys, skeleton, blood, and, tumors, the, longer, lived, isotope, technetium, 95m, with, a, half, life, of, 61, days, is, used, as, a, radioactive, tracer, to, study, the, movement, of, technetium, in, the, environment, and, in, plant, and, animal, systems, technetium, 99, decays, almost, entirely, by, beta, decay, emitting, beta, particles, with, consistent, low, energies, and, no, accompanying, gamma, rays, moreover, its, long, half, life, means, that, this, emission, decreases, very, slowly, with, time, it, can, also, be, extracted, to, a, high, chemical, and, isotopic, purity, from, radioactive, waste, for, these, reasons, it, is, a, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, nist, standard, beta, emitter, and, is, used, for, equipment, calibration, technetium, 99, has, also, been, proposed, for, optoelectronic, devices, and, nanoscale, nuclear, batteries, like, rhenium, and, palladium, technetium, can, serve, as, a, catalyst, in, processes, such, as, the, dehydrogenation, of, isopropyl, alcohol, it, is, a, far, more, effective, catalyst, than, either, rhenium, or, palladium, however, its, radioactivity, is, a, major, problem, in, safe, catalytic, applications, when, steel, is, immersed, in, water, adding, a, small, concentration, 55, ppm, of, potassium, pertechnetate, vii, to, the, water, protects, the, steel, from, corrosion, even, if, the, temperature, is, raised, to, 250, c, 523, k, for, this, reason, pertechnetate, has, been, used, as, an, anodic, corrosion, inhibitor, for, steel, although, technetium, s, radioactivity, poses, problems, that, limit, this, application, to, self, contained, systems, while, for, example, cro, 2, 4, can, also, inhibit, corrosion, it, requires, a, concentration, ten, times, as, high, in, one, experiment, a, specimen, of, carbon, steel, was, kept, in, an, aqueous, solution, of, pertechnetate, for, 20, years, and, was, still, uncorroded, the, mechanism, by, which, pertechnetate, prevents, corrosion, is, not, well, understood, but, seems, to, involve, the, reversible, formation, of, a, thin, surface, layer, passivation, one, theory, holds, that, the, pertechnetate, reacts, with, the, steel, surface, to, form, a, layer, of, technetium, dioxide, which, prevents, further, corrosion, the, same, effect, explains, how, iron, powder, can, be, used, to, remove, pertechnetate, from, water, the, effect, disappears, rapidly, if, the, concentration, of, pertechnetate, falls, below, the, minimum, concentration, or, if, too, high, a, concentration, of, other, ions, is, added, as, noted, the, radioactive, nature, of, technetium, 3, mbq, l, at, the, concentrations, required, makes, this, corrosion, protection, impractical, in, almost, all, situations, nevertheless, corrosion, protection, by, pertechnetate, ions, was, proposed, but, never, adopted, for, use, in, boiling, water, reactors, technetium, plays, no, natural, biological, role, and, is, not, normally, found, in, the, human, body, technetium, is, produced, in, quantity, by, nuclear, fission, and, spreads, more, readily, than, many, radionuclides, it, appears, to, have, low, chemical, toxicity, for, example, no, significant, change, in, blood, formula, body, and, organ, weights, and, food, consumption, could, be, detected, for, rats, which, ingested, up, to, 15, g, of, technetium, 99, per, gram, of, food, for, several, weeks, in, the, body, technetium, quickly, gets, converted, to, the, stable, tco, 4, ion, which, is, highly, water, soluble, and, quickly, excreted, the, radiological, toxicity, of, technetium, per, unit, of, mass, is, a, function, of, compound, type, of, radiation, for, the, isotope, in, question, and, the, isotope, s, half, life, all, isotopes, of, technetium, must, be, handled, carefully, the, most, common, isotope, technetium, 99, is, a, weak, beta, emitter, such, radiation, is, stopped, by, the, walls, of, laboratory, glassware, the, primary, hazard, when, working, with, technetium, is, inhalation, of, dust, such, radioactive, contamination, in, the, lungs, can, pose, a, significant, cancer, risk, for, most, work, careful, handling, in, a, fume, hood, is, sufficient, and, a, glove, box, is, not, needed
