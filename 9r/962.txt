wave, particle, duality, is, the, concept, in, quantum, mechanics, that, quantum, entities, exhibit, particle, or, wave, properties, according, to, the, experimental, circumstances, 59, it, expresses, the, inability, of, the, classical, concepts, such, as, particle, or, wave, to, fully, describe, the, behavior, of, quantum, objects, iii, 1, 1, during, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, light, was, found, to, behave, as, a, wave, then, later, discovered, to, have, a, particulate, behavior, whereas, electrons, behaved, like, particles, in, early, experiments, then, later, discovered, to, have, wavelike, behavior, the, concept, of, duality, arose, to, name, these, seeming, contradictions, in, the, late, 17th, century, sir, isaac, newton, had, advocated, that, light, was, particles, but, christiaan, huygens, took, an, opposing, wave, approach, thomas, young, s, interference, experiments, in, 1801, and, fran, ois, arago, s, detection, of, the, poisson, spot, in, 1819, validated, huygen, s, wave, models, however, the, wave, model, was, challenged, in, 1901, by, planck, s, law, for, black, body, radiation, max, planck, heuristically, derived, a, formula, for, the, observed, spectrum, by, assuming, that, a, hypothetical, electrically, charged, oscillator, in, a, cavity, that, contained, black, body, radiation, could, only, change, its, energy, in, a, minimal, increment, e, that, was, proportional, to, the, frequency, of, its, associated, electromagnetic, wave, in, 1905, einstein, interpreted, the, photoelectric, effect, also, with, discrete, energies, for, photons, these, both, indicate, particle, behavior, despite, confirmation, by, various, experimental, observations, the, photon, theory, as, it, came, to, be, called, remained, controversial, until, arthur, compton, performed, a, series, of, experiments, from, 1922, to, 1924, demonstrating, the, momentum, of, light, 211, the, experimental, evidence, of, particle, like, momentum, and, energy, seemingly, contradicted, the, earlier, work, demonstrating, wave, like, interference, of, light, the, contradictory, evidence, from, electrons, arrived, in, the, opposite, order, many, experiments, by, j, j, thomson, i, 361, robert, millikan, i, 89, and, charles, wilson, i, 4, among, others, had, shown, that, free, electrons, had, particle, properties, for, instance, the, measurement, of, their, mass, by, thompson, in, 1897, in, 1924, louis, de, broglie, introduced, his, theory, of, electron, waves, in, his, phd, thesis, recherches, sur, la, th, orie, des, quanta, he, suggested, that, an, electron, around, a, nucleus, could, be, thought, of, as, being, a, standing, wave, and, that, electrons, and, all, matter, could, be, considered, as, waves, he, merged, the, idea, of, thinking, about, them, as, particles, and, of, thinking, of, them, as, waves, he, proposed, that, particles, are, bundles, of, waves, wave, packets, that, move, with, a, group, velocity, and, have, an, effective, mass, both, of, these, depend, upon, the, energy, which, in, turn, connects, to, the, wavevector, and, the, relativistic, formulation, of, albert, einstein, a, few, years, before, following, de, broglie, s, proposal, of, wave, particle, duality, of, electrons, in, 1925, to, 1926, erwin, schr, dinger, developed, the, wave, equation, of, motion, for, electrons, this, rapidly, became, part, of, what, was, called, by, schr, dinger, undulatory, mechanics, now, called, the, schr, dinger, equation, and, also, wave, mechanics, in, 1926, max, born, gave, a, talk, in, an, oxford, meeting, about, using, the, electron, diffraction, experiments, to, confirm, the, wave, particle, duality, of, electrons, in, his, talk, born, cited, experimental, data, from, clinton, davisson, in, 1923, it, happened, that, davisson, also, attended, that, talk, davisson, returned, to, his, lab, in, the, us, to, switch, his, experimental, focus, to, test, the, wave, property, of, electrons, in, 1927, the, wave, nature, of, electrons, was, empirically, confirmed, by, two, experiments, the, davisson, germer, experiment, at, bell, labs, measured, electrons, scattered, from, ni, metal, surfaces, george, paget, thomson, and, alexander, reid, at, cambridge, university, scattered, electrons, through, thin, metal, films, and, observed, concentric, diffraction, rings, alexander, reid, who, was, thomson, s, graduate, student, performed, the, first, experiments, but, he, died, soon, after, in, a, motorcycle, accident, and, is, rarely, mentioned, these, experiments, were, rapidly, followed, by, the, first, non, relativistic, diffraction, model, for, electrons, by, hans, bethe, based, upon, the, schr, dinger, equation, which, is, very, close, to, how, electron, diffraction, is, now, described, significantly, davisson, and, germer, noticed, that, their, results, could, not, be, interpreted, using, a, bragg, s, law, approach, as, the, positions, were, systematically, different, the, approach, of, bethe, which, includes, the, refraction, due, to, the, average, potential, yielded, more, accurate, results, davisson, and, thomson, were, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, 1937, for, experimental, verification, of, wave, property, of, electrons, by, diffraction, experiments, similar, crystal, diffraction, experiments, were, carried, out, by, otto, stern, in, the, 1930s, using, beams, of, helium, atoms, and, hydrogen, molecules, these, experiments, further, verified, that, wave, behavior, is, not, limited, to, electrons, and, is, a, general, property, of, matter, on, a, microscopic, scale, before, proceeding, further, it, is, critical, to, introduce, some, definitions, of, waves, and, particles, both, in, a, classical, sense, and, in, quantum, mechanics, waves, and, particles, are, two, very, different, models, for, physical, systems, each, with, an, exceptionally, large, range, of, application, classical, waves, obey, the, wave, equation, they, have, continuous, values, at, many, points, in, space, that, vary, with, time, their, spatial, extent, can, vary, with, time, due, to, diffraction, and, they, display, wave, interference, physical, systems, exhibiting, wave, behavior, and, described, by, the, mathematics, of, wave, equations, include, water, waves, seismic, waves, sound, waves, radio, waves, and, more, classical, particles, obey, classical, mechanics, they, have, some, center, of, mass, and, extent, they, follow, trajectories, characterized, by, positions, and, velocities, that, vary, over, time, in, the, absence, of, forces, their, trajectories, are, straight, lines, stars, planets, spacecraft, tennis, balls, bullets, sand, grains, particle, models, work, across, a, huge, scale, unlike, waves, particles, do, not, exhibit, interference, some, experiments, on, quantum, systems, show, wave, like, interference, and, diffraction, some, experiments, show, particle, like, collisions, quantum, systems, obey, wave, equations, that, predict, particle, probability, distributions, these, particles, are, associated, with, discrete, values, called, quanta, for, properties, such, as, spin, electric, charge, and, magnetic, moment, these, particles, arrive, one, at, time, randomly, but, build, up, a, pattern, the, probability, that, experiments, will, measure, particles, at, a, point, in, space, is, the, square, of, a, complex, number, valued, wave, experiments, can, be, designed, to, exhibit, diffraction, and, interference, of, the, probability, amplitude, thus, statistically, large, numbers, of, the, random, particle, appearances, can, display, wave, like, properties, similar, equations, govern, collective, excitations, called, quasiparticles, the, electron, double, slit, experiment, is, a, textbook, demonstration, of, wave, particle, duality, a, modern, version, of, the, experiment, is, shown, schematically, in, the, figure, below, electrons, from, the, source, hit, a, wall, with, two, thin, slits, a, mask, behind, the, slits, can, expose, either, one, or, open, to, expose, both, slits, the, results, for, high, electron, intensity, are, shown, on, the, right, first, for, each, slit, individually, then, with, both, slits, open, with, either, slit, open, there, is, a, smooth, intensity, variation, due, to, diffraction, when, both, slits, are, open, the, intensity, oscillates, characteristic, of, wave, interference, having, observed, wave, behavior, now, change, the, experiment, lowering, the, intensity, of, the, electron, source, until, only, one, or, two, are, detected, per, second, appearing, as, individual, particles, dots, in, the, video, as, shown, in, the, movie, clip, below, the, dots, on, the, detector, seem, at, first, to, be, random, after, some, time, a, pattern, emerges, eventually, forming, an, alternating, sequence, of, light, and, dark, bands, the, experiment, shows, wave, interference, revealed, a, single, particle, at, a, time, quantum, mechanical, electrons, display, both, wave, and, particle, behavior, similar, results, have, been, shown, for, atoms, and, even, large, molecules, while, electrons, were, thought, to, be, particles, until, their, wave, properties, were, discovered, for, photons, it, was, the, opposite, in, 1887, heinrich, hertz, observed, that, when, light, with, sufficient, frequency, hits, a, metallic, surface, the, surface, emits, cathode, rays, what, are, now, called, electrons, 399, in, 1902, philipp, lenard, discovered, that, the, maximum, possible, energy, of, an, ejected, electron, is, unrelated, to, its, intensity, this, observation, is, at, odds, with, classical, electromagnetism, which, predicts, that, the, electron, s, energy, should, be, proportional, to, the, intensity, of, the, incident, radiation, 24, in, 1905, albert, einstein, suggested, that, the, energy, of, the, light, must, occur, a, finite, number, of, energy, quanta, he, postulated, that, electrons, can, receive, energy, from, an, electromagnetic, field, only, in, discrete, units, quanta, or, photons, an, amount, of, energy, e, that, was, related, to, the, frequency, f, of, the, light, by, where, h, is, the, planck, constant, 6, 626, 10, 34, j, s, only, photons, of, a, high, enough, frequency, above, a, certain, threshold, value, which, is, the, work, function, could, knock, an, electron, free, for, example, photons, of, blue, light, had, sufficient, energy, to, free, an, electron, from, the, metal, he, used, but, photons, of, red, light, did, not, one, photon, of, light, above, the, threshold, frequency, could, release, only, one, electron, the, higher, the, frequency, of, a, photon, the, higher, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, emitted, electron, but, no, amount, of, light, below, the, threshold, frequency, could, release, an, electron, despite, confirmation, by, various, experimental, observations, the, photon, theory, as, it, came, to, be, called, later, remained, controversial, until, arthur, compton, performed, a, series, of, experiments, from, 1922, to, 1924, demonstrating, the, momentum, of, light, 211, both, discrete, quantized, energies, and, also, momentum, are, classically, particle, attributes, there, are, many, other, examples, where, photons, display, particle, type, properties, for, instance, in, solar, sails, where, sunlight, could, propel, a, space, vehicle, and, laser, cooling, where, the, momentum, is, used, to, slow, down, cool, atoms, these, are, a, different, aspect, of, wave, particle, duality, normally, angular, momentum, is, considered, to, be, a, particle, like, property, for, instance, a, spinning, top, however, light, waves, can, have, angular, momentum, when, they, form, a, vortex, as, illustrated, in, the, figure, electron, waves, with, angular, momentum, have, also, been, produced, with, up, to, a, thousand, angular, momentum, quanta, these, matter, waves, will, diffract, and, interfere, while, simultaneously, having, particle, like, angular, momentum, so, they, will, interact, with, magnetic, fields, similar, to, a, current, loop, in, a, which, way, experiment, particle, detectors, are, placed, at, the, slits, to, determine, which, slit, the, electron, traveled, through, when, these, detectors, are, inserted, quantum, mechanics, predicts, that, the, interference, pattern, disappears, because, the, detected, part, of, the, electron, wave, has, changed, loss, of, coherence, many, similar, proposals, have, been, made, and, many, have, been, converted, into, experiments, and, tried, out, every, single, one, shows, the, same, result, as, soon, as, electron, trajectories, are, detected, interference, disappears, a, simple, example, of, these, which, way, experiments, uses, a, mach, zehnder, interferometer, a, device, based, on, lasers, and, mirrors, sketched, below, a, laser, beam, along, the, input, port, splits, at, a, half, silvered, mirror, part, of, the, beam, continues, straight, passes, though, a, glass, phase, shifter, then, reflects, downward, the, other, part, of, the, beam, reflects, from, the, first, mirror, then, turns, at, another, mirror, the, two, beams, meet, at, a, second, half, silvered, beam, splitter, each, output, port, has, a, camera, to, record, the, results, the, two, beams, show, interference, characteristic, of, wave, propagation, if, the, laser, intensity, is, turned, sufficiently, low, individual, dots, appear, on, the, cameras, building, up, the, pattern, as, in, the, electron, example, the, first, beam, splitter, mirror, acts, like, double, slits, but, in, the, interferometer, case, we, can, remove, the, second, beam, splitter, then, the, beam, heading, down, ends, up, in, output, port, 1, any, photon, particles, on, this, path, gets, counted, in, that, port, the, beam, going, across, the, top, ends, up, on, output, port, 2, in, either, case, the, counts, will, track, the, photon, trajectories, however, as, soon, as, the, second, beam, splitter, is, removed, the, interference, pattern, disappears
