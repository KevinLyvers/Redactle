in, physics, and, materials, science, elasticity, is, the, ability, of, a, body, to, resist, a, distorting, influence, and, to, return, to, its, original, size, and, shape, when, that, influence, or, force, is, removed, solid, objects, will, deform, when, adequate, loads, are, applied, to, them, if, the, material, is, elastic, the, object, will, return, to, its, initial, shape, and, size, after, removal, this, is, in, contrast, to, plasticity, in, which, the, object, fails, to, do, so, and, instead, remains, in, its, deformed, state, the, physical, reasons, for, elastic, behavior, can, be, quite, different, for, different, materials, in, metals, the, atomic, lattice, changes, size, and, shape, when, forces, are, applied, energy, is, added, to, the, system, when, forces, are, removed, the, lattice, goes, back, to, the, original, lower, energy, state, for, rubbers, and, other, polymers, elasticity, is, caused, by, the, stretching, of, polymer, chains, when, forces, are, applied, hooke, s, law, states, that, the, force, required, to, deform, elastic, objects, should, be, directly, proportional, to, the, distance, of, deformation, regardless, of, how, large, that, distance, becomes, this, is, known, as, perfect, elasticity, in, which, a, given, object, will, return, to, its, original, shape, no, matter, how, strongly, it, is, deformed, this, is, an, ideal, concept, only, most, materials, which, possess, elasticity, in, practice, remain, purely, elastic, only, up, to, very, small, deformations, after, which, plastic, permanent, deformation, occurs, in, engineering, the, elasticity, of, a, material, is, quantified, by, the, elastic, modulus, such, as, the, young, s, modulus, bulk, modulus, or, shear, modulus, which, measure, the, amount, of, stress, needed, to, achieve, a, unit, of, strain, a, higher, modulus, indicates, that, the, material, is, harder, to, deform, the, si, unit, of, this, modulus, is, the, pascal, pa, the, material, s, elastic, limit, or, yield, strength, is, the, maximum, stress, that, can, arise, before, the, onset, of, plastic, deformation, its, si, unit, is, also, the, pascal, pa, when, an, elastic, material, is, deformed, due, to, an, external, force, it, experiences, internal, resistance, to, the, deformation, and, restores, it, to, its, original, state, if, the, external, force, is, no, longer, applied, there, are, various, elastic, moduli, such, as, young, s, modulus, the, shear, modulus, and, the, bulk, modulus, all, of, which, are, measures, of, the, inherent, elastic, properties, of, a, material, as, a, resistance, to, deformation, under, an, applied, load, the, various, moduli, apply, to, different, kinds, of, deformation, for, instance, young, s, modulus, applies, to, extension, compression, of, a, body, whereas, the, shear, modulus, applies, to, its, shear, young, s, modulus, and, shear, modulus, are, only, for, solids, whereas, the, bulk, modulus, is, for, solids, liquids, and, gases, the, elasticity, of, materials, is, described, by, a, stress, strain, curve, which, shows, the, relation, between, stress, the, average, restorative, internal, force, per, unit, area, and, strain, the, relative, deformation, the, curve, is, generally, nonlinear, but, it, can, by, use, of, a, taylor, series, be, approximated, as, linear, for, sufficiently, small, deformations, in, which, higher, order, terms, are, negligible, if, the, material, is, isotropic, the, linearized, stress, strain, relationship, is, called, hooke, s, law, which, is, often, presumed, to, apply, up, to, the, elastic, limit, for, most, metals, or, crystalline, materials, whereas, nonlinear, elasticity, is, generally, required, to, model, large, deformations, of, rubbery, materials, even, in, the, elastic, range, for, even, higher, stresses, materials, exhibit, plastic, behavior, that, is, they, deform, irreversibly, and, do, not, return, to, their, original, shape, after, stress, is, no, longer, applied, for, rubber, like, materials, such, as, elastomers, the, slope, of, the, stress, strain, curve, increases, with, stress, meaning, that, rubbers, progressively, become, more, difficult, to, stretch, while, for, most, metals, the, gradient, decreases, at, very, high, stresses, meaning, that, they, progressively, become, easier, to, stretch, elasticity, is, not, exhibited, only, by, solids, non, newtonian, fluids, such, as, viscoelastic, fluids, will, also, exhibit, elasticity, in, certain, conditions, quantified, by, the, deborah, number, in, response, to, a, small, rapidly, applied, and, removed, strain, these, fluids, may, deform, and, then, return, to, their, original, shape, under, larger, strains, or, strains, applied, for, longer, periods, of, time, these, fluids, may, start, to, flow, like, a, viscous, liquid, because, the, elasticity, of, a, material, is, described, in, terms, of, a, stress, strain, relation, it, is, essential, that, the, terms, stress, and, strain, be, defined, without, ambiguity, typically, two, types, of, relation, are, considered, the, first, type, deals, with, materials, that, are, elastic, only, for, small, strains, the, second, deals, with, materials, that, are, not, limited, to, small, strains, clearly, the, second, type, of, relation, is, more, general, in, the, sense, that, it, must, include, the, first, type, as, a, special, case, for, small, strains, the, measure, of, stress, that, is, used, is, the, cauchy, stress, while, the, measure, of, strain, that, is, used, is, the, infinitesimal, strain, tensor, the, resulting, predicted, material, behavior, is, termed, linear, elasticity, which, for, isotropic, media, is, called, the, generalized, hooke, s, law, cauchy, elastic, materials, and, hypoelastic, materials, are, models, that, extend, hooke, s, law, to, allow, for, the, possibility, of, large, rotations, large, distortions, and, intrinsic, or, induced, anisotropy, for, more, general, situations, any, of, a, number, of, stress, measures, can, be, used, and, it, is, generally, desired, but, not, required, that, the, elastic, stress, strain, relation, be, phrased, in, terms, of, a, finite, strain, measure, that, is, work, conjugate, to, the, selected, stress, measure, i, e, the, time, integral, of, the, inner, product, of, the, stress, measure, with, the, rate, of, the, strain, measure, should, be, equal, to, the, change, in, internal, energy, for, any, adiabatic, process, that, remains, below, the, elastic, limit, the, si, unit, for, elasticity, and, the, elastic, modulus, is, the, pascal, pa, this, unit, is, defined, as, force, per, unit, area, generally, a, measurement, of, pressure, which, in, mechanics, corresponds, to, stress, the, pascal, and, therefore, elasticity, have, the, dimension, l, 1, m, t, 2, for, most, commonly, used, engineering, materials, the, elastic, modulus, is, on, the, scale, of, gigapascals, gpa, 10, 9, pa, as, noted, above, for, small, deformations, most, elastic, materials, such, as, springs, exhibit, linear, elasticity, and, can, be, described, by, a, linear, relation, between, the, stress, and, strain, this, relationship, is, known, as, hooke, s, law, a, geometry, dependent, version, of, the, idea, was, first, formulated, by, robert, hooke, in, 1675, as, a, latin, anagram, ceiiinosssttuv, he, published, the, answer, in, 1678, ut, tensio, sic, vis, meaning, as, the, extension, so, the, force, a, linear, relationship, commonly, referred, to, as, hooke, s, law, this, law, can, be, stated, as, a, relationship, between, tensile, force, f, and, corresponding, extension, displacement, x, displaystyle, x, where, k, is, a, constant, known, as, the, rate, or, spring, constant, it, can, also, be, stated, as, a, relationship, between, stress, displaystyle, sigma, and, strain, displaystyle, varepsilon, where, e, is, known, as, the, young, s, modulus, although, the, general, proportionality, constant, between, stress, and, strain, in, three, dimensions, is, a, 4th, order, tensor, called, stiffness, systems, that, exhibit, symmetry, such, as, a, one, dimensional, rod, can, often, be, reduced, to, applications, of, hooke, s, law, the, elastic, behavior, of, objects, that, undergo, finite, deformations, has, been, described, using, a, number, of, models, such, as, cauchy, elastic, material, models, hypoelastic, material, models, and, hyperelastic, material, models, the, deformation, gradient, f, is, the, primary, deformation, measure, used, in, finite, strain, theory, a, material, is, said, to, be, cauchy, elastic, if, the, cauchy, stress, tensor, is, a, function, of, the, deformation, gradient, f, alone, it, is, generally, incorrect, to, state, that, cauchy, stress, is, a, function, of, merely, a, strain, tensor, as, such, a, model, lacks, crucial, information, about, material, rotation, needed, to, produce, correct, results, for, an, anisotropic, medium, subjected, to, vertical, extension, in, comparison, to, the, same, extension, applied, horizontally, and, then, subjected, to, a, 90, degree, rotation, both, these, deformations, have, the, same, spatial, strain, tensors, yet, must, produce, different, values, of, the, cauchy, stress, tensor, even, though, the, stress, in, a, cauchy, elastic, material, depends, only, on, the, state, of, deformation, the, work, done, by, stresses, might, depend, on, the, path, of, deformation, therefore, cauchy, elasticity, includes, non, conservative, non, hyperelastic, models, in, which, work, of, deformation, is, path, dependent, as, well, as, conservative, hyperelastic, material, models, for, which, stress, can, be, derived, from, a, scalar, elastic, potential, function, a, hypoelastic, material, can, be, rigorously, defined, as, one, that, is, modeled, using, a, constitutive, equation, satisfying, the, following, two, criteria, if, only, these, two, original, criteria, are, used, to, define, hypoelasticity, then, hyperelasticity, would, be, included, as, a, special, case, which, prompts, some, constitutive, modelers, to, append, a, third, criterion, that, specifically, requires, a, hypoelastic, model, to, not, be, hyperelastic, i, e, hypoelasticity, implies, that, stress, is, not, derivable, from, an, energy, potential, if, this, third, criterion, is, adopted, it, follows, that, a, hypoelastic, material, might, admit, nonconservative, adiabatic, loading, paths, that, start, and, end, with, the, same, deformation, gradient, but, do, not, start, and, end, at, the, same, internal, energy, note, that, the, second, criterion, requires, only, that, the, function, g, displaystyle, g, exists, as, detailed, in, the, main, hypoelastic, material, article, specific, formulations, of, hypoelastic, models, typically, employ, so, called, objective, rates, so, that, the, g, displaystyle, g, function, exists, only, implicitly, and, is, typically, needed, explicitly, only, for, numerical, stress, updates, performed, via, direct, integration, of, the, actual, not, objective, stress, rate, hyperelastic, materials, also, called, green, elastic, materials, are, conservative, models, that, are, derived, from, a, strain, energy, density, function, w, a, model, is, hyperelastic, if, and, only, if, it, is, possible, to, express, the, cauchy, stress, tensor, as, a, function, of, the, deformation, gradient, via, a, relationship, of, the, form, this, formulation, takes, the, energy, potential, w, as, a, function, of, the, deformation, gradient, f, displaystyle, boldsymbol, f, by, also, requiring, satisfaction, of, material, objectivity, the, energy, potential, may, be, alternatively, regarded, as, a, function, of, the, cauchy, green, deformation, tensor, c, f, t, f, displaystyle, boldsymbol, c, boldsymbol, f, textsf, t, boldsymbol, f, in, which, case, the, hyperelastic, model, may, be, written, alternatively, as, linear, elasticity, is, used, widely, in, the, design, and, analysis, of, structures, such, as, beams, plates, and, shells, and, sandwich, composites, this, theory, is, also, the, basis, of, much, of, fracture, mechanics, hyperelasticity, is, primarily, used, to, determine, the, response, of, elastomer, based, objects, such, as, gaskets, and, of, biological, materials, such, as, soft, tissues, and, cell, membranes, in, a, given, isotropic, solid, with, known, theoretical, elasticity, for, the, bulk, material, in, terms, of, young, s, modulus, the, effective, elasticity, will, be, governed, by, porosity, generally, a, more, porous, material, will, exhibit, lower, stiffness, more, specifically, the, fraction, of, pores, their, distribution, at, different, sizes, and, the, nature, of, the, fluid, with, which, they, are, filled, give, rise, to, different, elastic, behaviours, in, solids, for, isotropic, materials, containing, cracks, the, presence, of, fractures, affects, the, young, and, the, shear, moduli, perpendicular, to, the, planes, of, the, cracks, which, decrease, young, s, modulus, faster, than, the, shear, modulus, as, the, fracture, density, increases, indicating, that, the, presence, of, cracks, makes, bodies, brittler, microscopically, the, stress, strain, relationship, of, materials, is, in, general, governed, by, the, helmholtz, free, energy, a, thermodynamic, quantity, molecules, settle, in, the, configuration, which, minimizes, the, free, energy, subject, to, constraints, derived, from, their, structure, and, depending, on, whether, the, energy, or, the, entropy, term, dominates, the, free, energy, materials, can, broadly, be, classified, as, energy, elastic, and, entropy, elastic, as, such, microscopic, factors, affecting, the, free, energy, such, as, the, equilibrium, distance, between, molecules, can, affect, the, elasticity, of, materials, for, instance, in, inorganic, materials, as, the, equilibrium, distance, between, molecules, at, 0, k, increases, the, bulk, modulus, decreases, the, effect, of, temperature, on, elasticity, is, difficult, to, isolate, because, there, are, numerous, factors, affecting, it, for, instance, the, bulk, modulus, of, a, material, is, dependent, on, the, form, of, its, lattice, its, behavior, under, expansion, as, well, as, the, vibrations, of, the, molecules, all, of, which, are, dependent, on, temperature
