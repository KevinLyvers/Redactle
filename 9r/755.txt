dew, is, water, in, the, form, of, droplets, that, appears, on, thin, exposed, objects, in, the, morning, or, evening, due, to, condensation, as, the, exposed, surface, cools, by, radiating, its, heat, atmospheric, moisture, condenses, at, a, rate, greater, than, that, at, which, it, can, evaporate, resulting, in, the, formation, of, water, droplets, when, temperatures, are, low, enough, dew, takes, the, form, of, ice, called, frost, because, dew, is, related, to, the, temperature, of, surfaces, in, late, summer, it, forms, most, easily, on, surfaces, that, are, not, warmed, by, conducted, heat, from, deep, ground, such, as, grass, leaves, railings, car, roofs, and, bridges, water, vapor, will, condense, into, droplets, depending, on, the, temperature, the, temperature, at, which, droplets, form, is, called, the, dew, point, when, surface, temperature, drops, eventually, reaching, the, dew, point, atmospheric, water, vapor, condenses, to, form, small, droplets, on, the, surface, this, process, distinguishes, dew, from, those, hydrometeors, meteorological, occurrences, of, water, which, form, directly, in, air, that, has, cooled, to, its, dew, point, typically, around, condensation, nuclei, such, as, fog, or, clouds, the, thermodynamic, principles, of, formation, however, are, the, same, dew, is, commonly, formed, during, select, times, of, the, day, nights, early, mornings, and, early, evenings, are, all, times, during, which, dew, is, likely, to, be, found, adequate, cooling, of, the, surface, typically, takes, place, when, it, loses, more, energy, by, infrared, radiation, than, it, receives, as, solar, radiation, from, the, sun, which, is, especially, the, case, on, clear, nights, poor, thermal, conductivity, restricts, the, replacement, of, such, losses, from, deeper, ground, layers, which, are, typically, warmer, at, night, preferred, objects, of, dew, formation, are, thus, poor, conducting, or, well, isolated, from, the, ground, and, non, metallic, while, shiny, metal, coated, surfaces, are, poor, infrared, radiators, preferred, weather, conditions, include, the, absence, of, clouds, and, little, water, vapor, in, the, higher, atmosphere, to, minimize, greenhouse, effects, and, sufficient, humidity, of, the, air, near, the, ground, typical, dew, nights, are, classically, considered, calm, because, the, wind, transports, nocturnally, warmer, air, from, higher, levels, to, the, cold, surface, however, if, the, atmosphere, is, the, major, source, of, moisture, this, type, is, called, dewfall, a, certain, amount, of, ventilation, is, needed, to, replace, the, vapor, that, is, already, condensed, the, highest, optimum, wind, speeds, could, be, found, on, arid, islands, wind, always, seems, adverse, however, if, the, wet, soil, beneath, is, the, major, source, of, vapor, in, which, case, dew, is, said, to, form, by, distillation, the, processes, of, dew, formation, do, not, restrict, its, occurrence, to, the, night, and, the, outdoors, they, are, also, working, when, eyeglasses, get, steamy, in, a, warm, wet, room, or, in, industrial, processes, however, the, term, condensation, is, preferred, in, these, cases, a, classical, device, for, dew, measurement, is, the, drosometer, a, small, artificial, condenser, surface, is, suspended, from, an, arm, attached, to, a, pointer, or, a, pen, that, records, the, weight, changes, of, the, condenser, on, a, drum, besides, being, very, wind, sensitive, however, this, like, all, artificial, surface, devices, only, provides, a, measure, of, the, meteorological, potential, for, dew, formation, the, actual, amount, of, dew, in, a, specific, place, is, strongly, dependent, on, surface, properties, for, its, measurement, plants, leaves, or, whole, soil, columns, are, placed, on, a, balance, with, their, surface, at, the, same, height, and, in, the, same, surroundings, as, would, occur, naturally, thus, providing, a, small, lysimeter, further, methods, include, estimation, by, means, of, comparing, the, droplets, to, standardized, photographs, or, volumetric, measurement, of, the, amount, of, water, wiped, from, the, surface, some, of, these, methods, include, guttation, while, others, only, measure, dewfall, and, or, distillation, due, to, its, dependence, on, radiation, balance, dew, amounts, can, reach, a, theoretical, maximum, of, about, 0, 8, mm, per, night, measured, values, however, rarely, exceed, 0, 5, mm, in, most, climates, of, the, world, the, annual, average, is, too, small, to, compete, with, rain, in, regions, with, considerable, dry, seasons, adapted, plants, like, lichen, or, pine, seedlings, benefit, from, dew, large, scale, natural, irrigation, without, rainfall, such, as, in, the, atacama, and, namib, deserts, however, is, mostly, attributed, to, fog, water, in, the, negev, desert, in, israel, dew, has, been, found, to, account, for, almost, half, of, the, water, found, in, three, dominant, desert, species, salsola, inermis, artemisia, sieberi, and, haloxylon, scoparium, another, effect, of, dew, is, its, hydration, of, fungal, substrates, and, the, mycelia, of, species, such, as, pleated, inkcaps, often, found, on, lawns, and, phytophthora, infestans, which, causes, blight, on, potato, plants, the, book, on, the, universe, de, mundo, composed, before, 250, bc, or, between, 350, and, 200, bc, stated, dew, is, moisture, minute, in, composition, falling, from, a, clear, sky, ice, is, water, congealed, in, a, condensed, form, from, a, clear, sky, hoar, frost, is, congealed, dew, and, dew, frost, is, dew, which, is, half, congealed, in, greek, mythology, ersa, is, the, goddess, and, personification, of, dew, also, according, to, the, myth, the, dew, in, the, morning, was, created, when, eos, ersa, s, aunt, goddess, of, the, dawn, cried, for, her, son, s, death, although, later, he, received, immortality, dew, known, in, hebrew, as, tal, is, significant, in, the, jewish, religion, for, agricultural, and, theological, purposes, on, the, first, day, of, passover, the, chazan, dressed, in, a, white, kittel, leads, a, service, in, which, he, prays, for, dew, between, that, point, and, sukkot, during, the, rainy, season, between, december, and, passover, there, are, also, additions, in, the, amidah, for, blessed, dew, to, come, together, with, rain, there, are, many, midrashim, that, refer, to, dew, as, being, the, tool, for, ultimate, resurrection, dewy, or, my, father, is, the, morning, dew, are, approximate, etymologies, of, the, hebrew, given, name, avital, in, the, biblical, torah, or, old, testament, dew, is, used, symbolically, in, deuteronomy, 32, 2, my, doctrine, shall, drop, as, the, rain, my, speech, shall, distill, as, the, dew, as, the, small, rain, upon, the, tender, herb, and, as, the, showers, upon, the, grass, in, the, catholic, mass, in, the, western, rite, whenever, the, second, eucharistic, prayer, is, used, the, priest, prays, over, bread, and, wine, to, god, the, father, make, holy, therefore, these, gifts, we, pray, by, sending, down, your, spirit, upon, them, like, the, dewfall, so, that, they, may, become, for, us, the, body, and, blood, of, our, lord, jesus, christ, the, idea, that, the, holy, spirit, enters, the, world, and, our, lives, in, a, quiet, undramatic, way, like, the, dewfall, has, great, appeal, for, many, christians, the, harvesting, of, dew, potentially, allows, water, availability, in, areas, where, supporting, weather, conditions, such, as, rain, are, lacking, several, man, made, devices, such, as, antique, big, stone, piles, in, ukraine, medieval, dew, ponds, in, southern, england, and, volcanic, stone, covers, on, the, fields, of, lanzarote, have, been, thought, to, be, dew, catching, devices, but, could, be, shown, to, work, on, other, principles, at, present, the, international, organization, for, dew, utilization, opur, is, working, on, effective, foil, based, condensers, for, regions, where, rain, or, fog, cannot, cover, water, needs, throughout, the, year, large, scale, dew, harvesting, systems, have, been, made, by, the, indian, institute, of, management, ahmedabad, iima, with, the, participation, of, opur, in, the, coastal, semiarid, region, of, kutch, these, condensers, can, harvest, more, than, 200, liters, on, average, of, dew, water, per, night, for, about, 90, nights, in, the, october, to, may, dew, season, the, iima, research, laboratory, has, shown, that, dew, can, serve, as, a, supplementary, source, of, water, in, coastal, arid, areas, a, large, scale, dew, harvesting, scheme, envisages, circulating, cold, sea, water, in, epdm, collectors, near, the, seashore, these, condense, dew, and, fog, to, supply, clean, drinking, water, other, more, recent, studies, display, possible, roof, integration, for, dew, harvesting, devices
