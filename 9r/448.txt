water, h, 2, o, is, a, polar, inorganic, compound, that, is, at, room, temperature, a, tasteless, and, odorless, liquid, which, is, nearly, colorless, apart, from, an, inherent, hint, of, blue, it, is, by, far, the, most, studied, chemical, compound, and, is, described, as, the, universal, solvent, and, the, solvent, of, life, it, is, the, most, abundant, substance, on, the, surface, of, earth, and, the, only, common, substance, to, exist, as, a, solid, liquid, and, gas, on, earth, s, surface, it, is, also, the, third, most, abundant, molecule, in, the, universe, behind, molecular, hydrogen, and, carbon, monoxide, water, molecules, form, hydrogen, bonds, with, each, other, and, are, strongly, polar, this, polarity, allows, it, to, dissociate, ions, in, salts, and, bond, to, other, polar, substances, such, as, alcohols, and, acids, thus, dissolving, them, its, hydrogen, bonding, causes, its, many, unique, properties, such, as, having, a, solid, form, less, dense, than, its, liquid, form, a, relatively, high, boiling, point, of, 100, c, for, its, molar, mass, and, a, high, heat, capacity, water, is, amphoteric, meaning, that, it, can, exhibit, properties, of, an, acid, or, a, base, depending, on, the, ph, of, the, solution, that, it, is, in, it, readily, produces, both, h, and, oh, ions, related, to, its, amphoteric, character, it, undergoes, self, ionization, the, product, of, the, activities, or, approximately, the, concentrations, of, h, and, oh, is, a, constant, so, their, respective, concentrations, are, inversely, proportional, to, each, other, water, is, the, chemical, substance, with, chemical, formula, h, 2, o, one, molecule, of, water, has, two, hydrogen, atoms, covalently, bonded, to, a, single, oxygen, atom, water, is, a, tasteless, odorless, liquid, at, ambient, temperature, and, pressure, liquid, water, has, weak, absorption, bands, at, wavelengths, of, around, 750, nm, which, cause, it, to, appear, to, have, a, blue, color, this, can, easily, be, observed, in, a, water, filled, bath, or, wash, basin, whose, lining, is, white, large, ice, crystals, as, in, glaciers, also, appear, blue, under, standard, conditions, water, is, primarily, a, liquid, unlike, other, analogous, hydrides, of, the, oxygen, family, which, are, generally, gaseous, this, unique, property, of, water, is, due, to, hydrogen, bonding, the, molecules, of, water, are, constantly, moving, concerning, each, other, and, the, hydrogen, bonds, are, continually, breaking, and, reforming, at, timescales, faster, than, 200, femtoseconds, 2, 10, 13, seconds, however, these, bonds, are, strong, enough, to, create, many, of, the, peculiar, properties, of, water, some, of, which, make, it, integral, to, life, within, the, earth, s, atmosphere, and, surface, the, liquid, phase, is, the, most, common, and, is, the, form, that, is, generally, denoted, by, the, word, water, the, solid, phase, of, water, is, known, as, ice, and, commonly, takes, the, structure, of, hard, amalgamated, crystals, such, as, ice, cubes, or, loosely, accumulated, granular, crystals, like, snow, aside, from, common, hexagonal, crystalline, ice, other, crystalline, and, amorphous, phases, of, ice, are, known, the, gaseous, phase, of, water, is, known, as, water, vapor, or, steam, visible, steam, and, clouds, are, formed, from, minute, droplets, of, water, suspended, in, the, air, water, also, forms, a, supercritical, fluid, the, critical, temperature, is, 647, k, and, the, critical, pressure, is, 22, 064, mpa, in, nature, this, only, rarely, occurs, in, extremely, hostile, conditions, a, likely, example, of, naturally, occurring, supercritical, water, is, in, the, hottest, parts, of, deep, water, hydrothermal, vents, in, which, water, is, heated, to, the, critical, temperature, by, volcanic, plumes, and, the, critical, pressure, is, caused, by, the, weight, of, the, ocean, at, the, extreme, depths, where, the, vents, are, located, this, pressure, is, reached, at, a, depth, of, about, 2200, meters, much, less, than, the, mean, depth, of, the, ocean, 3800, meters, water, has, a, very, high, specific, heat, capacity, of, 4184, j, kg, k, at, 20, c, 4182, j, kg, k, at, 25, c, the, second, highest, among, all, the, heteroatomic, species, after, ammonia, as, well, as, a, high, heat, of, vaporization, 40, 65, kj, mol, or, 2257, kj, kg, at, the, normal, boiling, point, both, of, which, are, a, result, of, the, extensive, hydrogen, bonding, between, its, molecules, these, two, unusual, properties, allow, water, to, moderate, earth, s, climate, by, buffering, large, fluctuations, in, temperature, most, of, the, additional, energy, stored, in, the, climate, system, since, 1970, has, accumulated, in, the, oceans, the, specific, enthalpy, of, fusion, more, commonly, known, as, latent, heat, of, water, is, 333, 55, kj, kg, at, 0, c, the, same, amount, of, energy, is, required, to, melt, ice, as, to, warm, ice, from, 160, c, up, to, its, melting, point, or, to, heat, the, same, amount, of, water, by, about, 80, c, of, common, substances, only, that, of, ammonia, is, higher, this, property, confers, resistance, to, melting, on, the, ice, of, glaciers, and, drift, ice, before, and, since, the, advent, of, mechanical, refrigeration, ice, was, and, still, is, in, common, use, for, retarding, food, spoilage, the, specific, heat, capacity, of, ice, at, 10, c, is, 2030, j, kg, k, and, the, heat, capacity, of, steam, at, 100, c, is, 2080, j, kg, k, the, density, of, water, is, about, 1, gram, per, cubic, centimetre, 62, lb, cu, ft, this, relationship, was, originally, used, to, define, the, gram, the, density, varies, with, temperature, but, not, linearly, as, the, temperature, increases, the, density, rises, to, a, peak, at, 3, 98, c, 39, 16, f, and, then, decreases, the, initial, increase, is, unusual, because, most, liquids, undergo, thermal, expansion, so, that, the, density, only, decreases, as, a, function, of, temperature, the, increase, observed, for, water, from, 0, c, 32, f, to, 3, 98, c, 39, 16, f, and, for, a, few, other, liquids, is, described, as, negative, thermal, expansion, regular, hexagonal, ice, is, also, less, dense, than, liquid, water, upon, freezing, the, density, of, water, decreases, by, about, 9, these, peculiar, effects, are, due, to, the, highly, directional, bonding, of, water, molecules, via, the, hydrogen, bonds, ice, and, liquid, water, at, low, temperature, have, comparatively, low, density, low, energy, open, lattice, structures, the, breaking, of, hydrogen, bonds, on, melting, with, increasing, temperature, in, the, range, 0, 4, c, allows, for, a, denser, molecular, packing, in, which, some, of, the, lattice, cavities, are, filled, by, water, molecules, above, 4, c, however, thermal, expansion, becomes, the, dominant, effect, and, water, near, the, boiling, point, 100, c, is, about, 4, less, dense, than, water, at, 4, c, 39, f, under, increasing, pressure, ice, undergoes, a, number, of, transitions, to, other, polymorphs, with, higher, density, than, liquid, water, such, as, ice, ii, ice, iii, high, density, amorphous, ice, hda, and, very, high, density, amorphous, ice, vhda, the, unusual, density, curve, and, lower, density, of, ice, than, of, water, is, essential, for, much, of, the, life, on, earth, if, water, were, most, dense, at, the, freezing, point, then, in, winter, the, cooling, at, the, surface, would, lead, to, convective, mixing, once, 0, c, are, reached, the, water, body, would, freeze, from, the, bottom, up, and, all, life, in, it, would, be, killed, furthermore, given, that, water, is, a, good, thermal, insulator, due, to, its, heat, capacity, some, frozen, lakes, might, not, completely, thaw, in, summer, as, it, is, the, inversion, of, the, density, curve, leads, to, a, stable, layering, for, surface, temperatures, below, 4, c, and, with, the, layer, of, ice, that, floats, on, top, insulating, the, water, below, even, e, g, lake, baikal, in, central, siberia, freezes, only, to, about, 1, m, thickness, in, winter, in, general, for, deep, enough, lakes, the, temperature, at, the, bottom, stays, constant, at, about, 4, c, 39, f, throughout, the, year, see, diagram, the, density, of, saltwater, depends, on, the, dissolved, salt, content, as, well, as, the, temperature, ice, still, floats, in, the, oceans, otherwise, they, would, freeze, from, the, bottom, up, however, the, salt, content, of, oceans, lowers, the, freezing, point, by, about, 1, 9, c, due, to, freezing, point, depression, of, a, solvent, containing, a, solute, and, lowers, the, temperature, of, the, density, maximum, of, water, to, the, former, freezing, point, at, 0, c, this, is, why, in, ocean, water, the, downward, convection, of, colder, water, is, not, blocked, by, an, expansion, of, water, as, it, becomes, colder, near, the, freezing, point, the, oceans, cold, water, near, the, freezing, point, continues, to, sink, so, creatures, that, live, at, the, bottom, of, cold, oceans, like, the, arctic, ocean, generally, live, in, water, 4, c, colder, than, at, the, bottom, of, frozen, over, fresh, water, lakes, and, rivers, as, the, surface, of, saltwater, begins, to, freeze, at, 1, 9, c, for, normal, salinity, seawater, 3, 5, the, ice, that, forms, is, essentially, salt, free, with, about, the, same, density, as, freshwater, ice, this, ice, floats, on, the, surface, and, the, salt, that, is, frozen, out, adds, to, the, salinity, and, density, of, the, seawater, just, below, it, in, a, process, known, as, brine, rejection, this, denser, saltwater, sinks, by, convection, and, the, replacing, seawater, is, subject, to, the, same, process, this, produces, essentially, freshwater, ice, at, 1, 9, c, on, the, surface, the, increased, density, of, the, seawater, beneath, the, forming, ice, causes, it, to, sink, towards, the, bottom, on, a, large, scale, the, process, of, brine, rejection, and, sinking, cold, salty, water, results, in, ocean, currents, forming, to, transport, such, water, away, from, the, poles, leading, to, a, global, system, of, currents, called, the, thermohaline, circulation, water, is, miscible, with, many, liquids, including, ethanol, in, all, proportions, water, and, most, oils, are, immiscible, usually, forming, layers, according, to, increasing, density, from, the, top, this, can, be, predicted, by, comparing, the, polarity, water, being, a, relatively, polar, compound, will, tend, to, be, miscible, with, liquids, of, high, polarity, such, as, ethanol, and, acetone, whereas, compounds, with, low, polarity, will, tend, to, be, immiscible, and, poorly, soluble, such, as, with, hydrocarbons, as, a, gas, water, vapor, is, completely, miscible, with, air, on, the, other, hand, the, maximum, water, vapor, pressure, that, is, thermodynamically, stable, with, the, liquid, or, solid, at, a, given, temperature, is, relatively, low, compared, with, total, atmospheric, pressure, for, example, if, the, vapor, s, partial, pressure, is, 2, of, atmospheric, pressure, and, the, air, is, cooled, from, 25, c, starting, at, about, 22, c, water, will, start, to, condense, defining, the, dew, point, and, creating, fog, or, dew, the, reverse, process, accounts, for, the, fog, burning, off, in, the, morning, if, the, humidity, is, increased, at, room, temperature, for, example, by, running, a, hot, shower, or, a, bath, and, the, temperature, stays, about, the, same, the, vapor, soon, reaches, the, pressure, for, phase, change, and, then, condenses, out, as, minute, water, droplets, commonly, referred, to, as, steam, a, saturated, gas, or, one, with, 100, relative, humidity, is, when, the, vapor, pressure, of, water, in, the, air, is, at, equilibrium, with, vapor, pressure, due, to, liquid, water, water, or, ice, if, cool, enough, will, fail, to, lose, mass, through, evaporation, when, exposed, to, saturated, air, because, the, amount, of, water, vapor, in, the, air, is, small, relative, humidity, the, ratio, of, the, partial, pressure, due, to, the, water, vapor, to, the, saturated, partial, vapor, pressure, is, much, more, useful, vapor, pressure, above, 100, relative, humidity, is, called, supersaturated, and, can, occur, if, the, air, is, rapidly, cooled, for, example, by, rising, suddenly, in, an, updraft, the, compressibility, of, water, is, a, function, of, pressure, and, temperature, at, 0, c, at, the, limit, of, zero, pressure, the, compressibility, is, 5, 1, 10, 10, pa, 1, at, the, zero, pressure, limit, the, compressibility, reaches, a, minimum, of, 4, 4, 10, 10, pa, 1, around, 45, c, before, increasing, again, with, increasing, temperature, as, the, pressure, is, increased, the, compressibility, decreases, being, 3, 9, 10, 10, pa, 1, at, 0, c, and, 100, megapascals, 1, 000, bar, the, bulk, modulus, of, water, is, about, 2, 2, gpa, the, low, compressibility, of, non, gasses, and, of, water, in, particular, leads, to, their, often, being, assumed, as, incompressible, the, low, compressibility, of, water, means, that, even, in, the, deep, oceans, at, 4, km, depth, where, pressures, are, 40, mpa, there, is, only, a, 1, 8, decrease, in, volume, the, bulk, modulus, of, water, ice, ranges, from, 11, 3, gpa, at, 0, k, up, to, 8, 6, gpa, at, 273, k, the, large, change, in, the, compressibility, of, ice, as, a, function, of, temperature, is, the, result, of, its, relatively, large, thermal, expansion, coefficient, compared, to, other, common, solids, the, temperature, and, pressure, at, which, ordinary, solid, liquid, and, gaseous, water, coexist, in, equilibrium, is, a, triple, point, of, water, since, 1954, this, point, had, been, used, to, define, the, base, unit, of, temperature, the, kelvin, but, starting, in, 2019, the, kelvin, is, now, defined, using, the, boltzmann, constant, rather, than, the, triple, point, of, water, due, to, the, existence, of, many, polymorphs, forms, of, ice, water, has, other, triple, points, which, have, either, three, polymorphs, of, ice, or, two, polymorphs, of, ice, and, liquid, in, equilibrium, gustav, heinrich, johann, apollon, tammann, in, g, ttingen, produced, data, on, several, other, triple, points, in, the, early, 20th, century, kamb, and, others, documented, further, triple, points, in, the, 1960s, the, melting, point, of, ice, is, 0, c, 32, f, 273, k, at, standard, pressure, however, pure, liquid, water, can, be, supercooled, well, below, that, temperature, without, freezing, if, the, liquid, is, not, mechanically, disturbed, it, can, remain, in, a, fluid, state, down, to, its, homogeneous, nucleation, point, of, about, 231, k, 42, c, 44, f, the, melting, point, of, ordinary, hexagonal, ice, falls, slightly, under, moderately, high, pressures, by, 0, 0073, c, 0, 0131, f, atm, or, about, 0, 5, c, 0, 90, f, 70, atm, as, the, stabilization, energy, of, hydrogen, bonding, is, exceeded, by, intermolecular, repulsion, but, as, ice, transforms, into, its, polymorphs, see, crystalline, states, of, ice, above, 209, 9, mpa, 2, 072, atm, the, melting, point, increases, markedly, with, pressure, i, e, reaching, 355, k, 82, c, at, 2, 216, gpa, 21, 870, atm, triple, point, of, ice, vii, pure, water, containing, no, exogenous, ions, is, an, excellent, electronic, insulator, but, not, even, deionized, water, is, completely, free, of, ions, water, undergoes, autoionization, in, the, liquid, state, when, two, water, molecules, form, one, hydroxide, anion, oh, and, one, hydronium, cation, h, 3, o, because, of, autoionization, at, ambient, temperatures, pure, liquid, water, has, a, similar, intrinsic, charge, carrier, concentration, to, the, semiconductor, germanium, and, an, intrinsic, charge, carrier, concentration, three, orders, of, magnitude, greater, than, the, semiconductor, silicon, hence, based, on, charge, carrier, concentration, water, can, not, be, considered, to, be, a, completely, dielectric, material, or, electrical, insulator, but, to, be, a, limited, conductor, of, ionic, charge, because, water, is, such, a, good, solvent, it, almost, always, has, some, solute, dissolved, in, it, often, a, salt, if, water, has, even, a, tiny, amount, of, such, an, impurity, then, the, ions, can, carry, charges, back, and, forth, allowing, the, water, to, conduct, electricity, far, more, readily, it, is, known, that, the, theoretical, maximum, electrical, resistivity, for, water, is, approximately, 18, 2, m, cm, 182, k, m, at, 25, c, this, figure, agrees, well, with, what, is, typically, seen, on, reverse, osmosis, ultra, filtered, and, deionized, ultra, pure, water, systems, used, for, instance, in, semiconductor, manufacturing, plants, a, salt, or, acid, contaminant, level, exceeding, even, 100, parts, per, trillion, ppt, in, otherwise, ultra, pure, water, begins, to, noticeably, lower, its, resistivity, by, up, to, several, k, m, in, pure, water, sensitive, equipment, can, detect, a, very, slight, electrical, conductivity, of, 0, 05501, 0, 0001, s, cm, at, 25, 00, c, water, can, also, be, electrolyzed, into, oxygen, and, hydrogen, gases, but, in, the, absence, of, dissolved, ions, this, is, a, very, slow, process, as, very, little, current, is, conducted, in, ice, the, primary, charge, carriers, are, protons, see, proton, conductor, ice, was, previously, thought, to, have, a, small, but, measurable, conductivity, of, 1, 10, 10, s, cm, but, this, conductivity, is, now, thought, to, be, almost, entirely, from, surface, defects, and, without, those, ice, is, an, insulator, with, an, immeasurably, small, conductivity, an, important, feature, of, water, is, its, polar, nature, the, structure, has, a, bent, molecular, geometry, for, the, two, hydrogens, from, the, oxygen, vertex, the, oxygen, atom, also, has, two, lone, pairs, of, electrons, one, effect, usually, ascribed, to, the, lone, pairs, is, that, the, h, o, h, gas, phase, bend, angle, is, 104, 48, which, is, smaller, than, the, typical, tetrahedral, angle, of, 109, 47, the, lone, pairs, are, closer, to, the, oxygen, atom, than, the, electrons, sigma, bonded, to, the, hydrogens, so, they, require, more, space, the, increased, repulsion, of, the, lone, pairs, forces, the, o, h, bonds, closer, to, each, other, another, consequence, of, its, structure, is, that, water, is, a, polar, molecule, due, to, the, difference, in, electronegativity, a, bond, dipole, moment, points, from, each, h, to, the, o, making, the, oxygen, partially, negative, and, each, hydrogen, partially, positive, a, large, molecular, dipole, points, from, a, region, between, the, two, hydrogen, atoms, to, the, oxygen, atom, the, charge, differences, cause, water, molecules, to, aggregate, the, relatively, positive, areas, being, attracted, to, the, relatively, negative, areas, this, attraction, hydrogen, bonding, explains, many, of, the, properties, of, water, such, as, its, solvent, properties, although, hydrogen, bonding, is, a, relatively, weak, attraction, compared, to, the, covalent, bonds, within, the, water, molecule, itself, it, is, responsible, for, several, of, the, water, s, physical, properties, these, properties, include, its, relatively, high, melting, and, boiling, point, temperatures, more, energy, is, required, to, break, the, hydrogen, bonds, between, water, molecules, in, contrast, hydrogen, sulfide, h, 2, s, has, much, weaker, hydrogen, bonding, due, to, sulfur, s, lower, electronegativity, h, 2, s, is, a, gas, at, room, temperature, despite, hydrogen, sulfide, having, nearly, twice, the, molar, mass, of, water, the, extra, bonding, between, water, molecules, also, gives, liquid, water, a, large, specific, heat, capacity, this, high, heat, capacity, makes, water, a, good, heat, storage, medium, coolant, and, heat, shield, water, molecules, stay, close, to, each, other, cohesion, due, to, the, collective, action, of, hydrogen, bonds, between, water, molecules, these, hydrogen, bonds, are, constantly, breaking, with, new, bonds, being, formed, with, different, water, molecules, but, at, any, given, time, in, a, sample, of, liquid, water, a, large, portion, of, the, molecules, are, held, together, by, such, bonds, water, also, has, high, adhesion, properties, because, of, its, polar, nature, on, clean, smooth, glass, the, water, may, form, a, thin, film, because, the, molecular, forces, between, glass, and, water, molecules, adhesive, forces, are, stronger, than, the, cohesive, forces, in, biological, cells, and, organelles, water, is, in, contact, with, membrane, and, protein, surfaces, that, are, hydrophilic, that, is, surfaces, that, have, a, strong, attraction, to, water, irving, langmuir, observed, a, strong, repulsive, force, between, hydrophilic, surfaces, to, dehydrate, hydrophilic, surfaces, to, remove, the, strongly, held, layers, of, water, of, hydration, requires, doing, substantial, work, against, these, forces, called, hydration, forces, these, forces, are, very, large, but, decrease, rapidly, over, a, nanometer, or, less, they, are, important, in, biology, particularly, when, cells, are, dehydrated, by, exposure, to, dry, atmospheres, or, to, extracellular, freezing, water, has, an, unusually, high, surface, tension, of, 71, 99, mn, m, at, 25, c, which, is, caused, by, the, strength, of, the, hydrogen, bonding, between, water, molecules, this, allows, insects, to, walk, on, water, because, water, has, strong, cohesive, and, adhesive, forces, it, exhibits, capillary, action, strong, cohesion, from, hydrogen, bonding, and, adhesion, allows, trees, to, transport, water, more, than, 100, m, upward, water, is, an, excellent, solvent, due, to, its, high, dielectric, constant, substances, that, mix, well, and, dissolve, in, water, are, known, as, hydrophilic, water, loving, substances, while, those, that, do, not, mix, well, with, water, are, known, as, hydrophobic, water, fearing, substances, the, ability, of, a, substance, to, dissolve, in, water, is, determined, by, whether, or, not, the, substance, can, match, or, better, the, strong, attractive, forces, that, water, molecules, generate, between, other, water, molecules, if, a, substance, has, properties, that, do, not, allow, it, to, overcome, these, strong, intermolecular, forces, the, molecules, are, precipitated, out, from, the, water, contrary, to, the, common, misconception, water, and, hydrophobic, substances, do, not, repel, and, the, hydration, of, a, hydrophobic, surface, is, energetically, but, not, entropically, favorable, when, an, ionic, or, polar, compound, enters, water, it, is, surrounded, by, water, molecules, hydration, the, relatively, small, size, of, water, molecules, 3, angstroms, allows, many, water, molecules, to, surround, one, molecule, of, solute, the, partially, negative, dipole, ends, of, the, water, are, attracted, to, positively, charged, components, of, the, solute, and, vice, versa, for, the, positive, dipole, ends, in, general, ionic, and, polar, substances, such, as, acids, alcohols, and, salts, are, relatively, soluble, in, water, and, nonpolar, substances, such, as, fats, and, oils, are, not, nonpolar, molecules, stay, together, in, water, because, it, is, energetically, more, favorable, for, the, water, molecules, to, hydrogen, bond, to, each, other, than, to, engage, in, van, der, waals, interactions, with, non, polar, molecules, an, example, of, an, ionic, solute, is, table, salt, the, sodium, chloride, nacl, separates, into, na, cations, and, cl, anions, each, being, surrounded, by, water, molecules, the, ions, are, then, easily, transported, away, from, their, crystalline, lattice, into, solution, an, example, of, a, nonionic, solute, is, table, sugar, the, water, dipoles, make, hydrogen, bonds, with, the, polar, regions, of, the, sugar, molecule, oh, groups, and, allow, it, to, be, carried, away, into, solution, the, quantum, tunneling, dynamics, in, water, was, reported, as, early, as, 1992, at, that, time, it, was, known, that, there, are, motions, which, destroy, and, regenerate, the, weak, hydrogen, bond, by, internal, rotations, of, the, substituent, water, monomers, on, 18, march, 2016, it, was, reported, that, the, hydrogen, bond, can, be, broken, by, quantum, tunneling, in, the, water, hexamer, unlike, previously, reported, tunneling, motions, in, water, this, involved, the, concerted, breaking, of, two, hydrogen, bonds, later, in, the, same, year, the, discovery, of, the, quantum, tunneling, of, water, molecules, was, reported, water, is, relatively, transparent, to, visible, light, near, ultraviolet, light, and, far, red, light, but, it, absorbs, most, ultraviolet, light, infrared, light, and, microwaves, most, photoreceptors, and, photosynthetic, pigments, utilize, the, portion, of, the, light, spectrum, that, is, transmitted, well, through, water, microwave, ovens, take, advantage, of, water, s, opacity, to, microwave, radiation, to, heat, the, water, inside, of, foods, water, s, light, blue, color, is, caused, by, weak, absorption, in, the, red, part, of, the, visible, spectrum, a, single, water, molecule, can, participate, in, a, maximum, of, four, hydrogen, bonds, because, it, can, accept, two, bonds, using, the, lone, pairs, on, oxygen, and, donate, two, hydrogen, atoms, other, molecules, like, hydrogen, fluoride, ammonia, and, methanol, can, also, form, hydrogen, bonds, however, they, do, not, show, anomalous, thermodynamic, kinetic, or, structural, properties, like, those, observed, in, water, because, none, of, them, can, form, four, hydrogen, bonds, either, they, cannot, donate, or, accept, hydrogen, atoms, or, there, are, steric, effects, in, bulky, residues, in, water, intermolecular, tetrahedral, structures, form, due, to, the, four, hydrogen, bonds, thereby, forming, an, open, structure, and, a, three, dimensional, bonding, network, resulting, in, the, anomalous, decrease, in, density, when, cooled, below, 4, c, this, repeated, constantly, reorganizing, unit, defines, a, three, dimensional, network, extending, throughout, the, liquid, this, view, is, based, upon, neutron, scattering, studies, and, computer, simulations, and, it, makes, sense, in, the, light, of, the, unambiguously, tetrahedral, arrangement, of, water, molecules, in, ice, structures, however, there, is, an, alternative, theory, for, the, structure, of, water, in, 2004, a, controversial, paper, from, stockholm, university, suggested, that, water, molecules, in, the, liquid, state, typically, bind, not, to, four, but, only, two, others, thus, forming, chains, and, rings, the, term, string, theory, of, water, which, is, not, to, be, confused, with, the, string, theory, of, physics, was, coined, these, observations, were, based, upon, x, ray, absorption, spectroscopy, that, probed, the, local, environment, of, individual, oxygen, atoms, the, repulsive, effects, of, the, two, lone, pairs, on, the, oxygen, atom, cause, water, to, have, a, bent, not, linear, molecular, structure, allowing, it, to, be, polar, the, hydrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, angle, is, 104, 45, which, is, less, than, the, 109, 47, for, ideal, sp, 3, hybridization, the, valence, bond, theory, explanation, is, that, the, oxygen, atom, s, lone, pairs, are, physically, larger, and, therefore, take, up, more, space, than, the, oxygen, atom, s, bonds, to, the, hydrogen, atoms, the, molecular, orbital, theory, explanation, bent, s, rule, is, that, lowering, the, energy, of, the, oxygen, atom, s, nonbonding, hybrid, orbitals, by, assigning, them, more, s, character, and, less, p, character, and, correspondingly, raising, the, energy, of, the, oxygen, atom, s, hybrid, orbitals, bonded, to, the, hydrogen, atoms, by, assigning, them, more, p, character, and, less, s, character, has, the, net, effect, of, lowering, the, energy, of, the, occupied, molecular, orbitals, because, the, energy, of, the, oxygen, atom, s, nonbonding, hybrid, orbitals, contributes, completely, to, the, energy, of, the, oxygen, atom, s, lone, pairs, while, the, energy, of, the, oxygen, atom, s, other, two, hybrid, orbitals, contributes, only, partially, to, the, energy, of, the, bonding, orbitals, the, remainder, of, the, contribution, coming, from, the, hydrogen, atoms, 1s, orbitals, in, liquid, water, there, is, some, self, ionization, giving, hydronium, ions, and, hydroxide, ions, the, equilibrium, constant, for, this, reaction, known, as, the, ionic, product, of, water, k, w, h, 3, o, o, h, displaystyle, k, rm, w, has, a, value, of, about, 10, 14, at, 25, c, at, neutral, ph, the, concentration, of, the, hydroxide, ion, oh, equals, that, of, the, solvated, hydrogen, ion, h, with, a, value, close, to, 10, 7, mol, l, 1, at, 25, c, see, data, page, for, values, at, other, temperatures, the, thermodynamic, equilibrium, constant, is, a, quotient, of, thermodynamic, activities, of, all, products, and, reactants, including, water, however, for, dilute, solutions, the, activity, of, a, solute, such, as, h, 3, o, or, oh, is, approximated, by, its, concentration, and, the, activity, of, the, solvent, h, 2, o, is, approximated, by, 1, so, that, we, obtain, the, simple, ionic, product, k, e, q, k, w, h, 3, o, o, h, displaystyle, k, rm, eq, approx, k, rm, w, the, action, of, water, on, rock, over, long, periods, of, time, typically, leads, to, weathering, and, water, erosion, physical, processes, that, convert, solid, rocks, and, minerals, into, soil, and, sediment, but, under, some, conditions, chemical, reactions, with, water, occur, as, well, resulting, in, metasomatism, or, mineral, hydration, a, type, of, chemical, alteration, of, a, rock, which, produces, clay, minerals, it, also, occurs, when, portland, cement, hardens, water, ice, can, form, clathrate, compounds, known, as, clathrate, hydrates, with, a, variety, of, small, molecules, that, can, be, embedded, in, its, spacious, crystal, lattice, the, most, notable, of, these, is, methane, clathrate, 4, ch, 4, 23h, 2, o, naturally, found, in, large, quantities, on, the, ocean, floor, rain, is, generally, mildly, acidic, with, a, ph, between, 5, 2, and, 5, 8, if, not, having, any, acid, stronger, than, carbon, dioxide, if, high, amounts, of, nitrogen, and, sulfur, oxides, are, present, in, the, air, they, too, will, dissolve, into, the, cloud, and, raindrops, producing, acid, rain, several, isotopes, of, both, hydrogen, and, oxygen, exist, giving, rise, to, several, known, isotopologues, of, water, vienna, standard, mean, ocean, water, is, the, current, international, standard, for, water, isotopes, naturally, occurring, water, is, almost, completely, composed, of, the, neutron, less, hydrogen, isotope, protium, only, 155, ppm, include, deuterium, 2, h, or, d, a, hydrogen, isotope, with, one, neutron, and, fewer, than, 20, parts, per, quintillion, include, tritium, 3, h, or, t, which, has, two, neutrons, oxygen, also, has, three, stable, isotopes, with, 16, o, present, in, 99, 76, 17, o, in, 0, 04, and, 18, o, in, 0, 2, of, water, molecules, deuterium, oxide, d, 2, o, is, also, known, as, heavy, water, because, of, its, higher, density, it, is, used, in, nuclear, reactors, as, a, neutron, moderator, tritium, is, radioactive, decaying, with, a, half, life, of, 4500, days, tho, exists, in, nature, only, in, minute, quantities, being, produced, primarily, via, cosmic, ray, induced, nuclear, reactions, in, the, atmosphere, water, with, one, protium, and, one, deuterium, atom, hdo, occur, naturally, in, ordinary, water, in, low, concentrations, 0, 03, and, d, 2, o, in, far, lower, amounts, 0, 000003, and, any, such, molecules, are, temporary, as, the, atoms, recombine, the, most, notable, physical, differences, between, h, 2, o, and, d, 2, o, other, than, the, simple, difference, in, specific, mass, involve, properties, that, are, affected, by, hydrogen, bonding, such, as, freezing, and, boiling, and, other, kinetic, effects, this, is, because, the, nucleus, of, deuterium, is, twice, as, heavy, as, protium, and, this, causes, noticeable, differences, in, bonding, energies, the, difference, in, boiling, points, allows, the, isotopologues, to, be, separated, the, self, diffusion, coefficient, of, h, 2, o, at, 25, c, is, 23, higher, than, the, value, of, d, 2, o, because, water, molecules, exchange, hydrogen, atoms, with, one, another, hydrogen, deuterium, oxide, doh, is, much, more, common, in, low, purity, heavy, water, than, pure, dideuterium, monoxide, d, 2, o, consumption, of, pure, isolated, d, 2, o, may, affect, biochemical, processes, ingestion, of, large, amounts, impairs, kidney, and, central, nervous, system, function, small, quantities, can, be, consumed, without, any, ill, effects, humans, are, generally, unaware, of, taste, differences, but, sometimes, report, a, burning, sensation, or, sweet, flavor, very, large, amounts, of, heavy, water, must, be, consumed, for, any, toxicity, to, become, apparent, rats, however, are, able, to, avoid, heavy, water, by, smell, and, it, is, toxic, to, many, animals, light, water, refers, to, deuterium, depleted, water, ddw, water, in, which, the, deuterium, content, has, been, reduced, below, the, standard, 155, ppm, level, water, is, the, most, abundant, substance, on, earth, s, surface, and, also, the, third, most, abundant, molecule, in, the, universe, after, h, 2, and, co, 0, 23, ppm, of, the, earth, s, mass, is, water, and, 97, 39, of, the, global, water, volume, of, 1, 38, 10, 9, km, 3, is, found, in, the, oceans, water, is, far, more, prevalent, in, the, outer, solar, system, beyond, a, point, called, the, frost, line, where, the, sun, s, radiation, is, too, weak, to, vaporize, solid, and, liquid, water, as, well, as, other, elements, and, chemical, compounds, with, relatively, low, melting, points, such, as, methane, and, ammonia, in, the, inner, solar, system, planets, asteroids, and, moons, formed, almost, entirely, of, metals, and, silicates, water, has, since, been, delivered, to, the, inner, solar, system, via, an, as, yet, unknown, mechanism, theorized, to, be, the, impacts, of, asteroids, or, comets, carrying, water, from, the, outer, solar, system, where, bodies, contain, much, more, water, ice, the, difference, between, planetary, bodies, located, inside, and, outside, the, frost, line, can, be, stark, earth, s, mass, is, 0, 000023, water, while, tethys, a, moon, of, saturn, is, almost, entirely, made, of, water, water, is, amphoteric, it, has, the, ability, to, act, as, either, an, acid, or, a, base, in, chemical, reactions, according, to, the, br, nsted, lowry, definition, an, acid, is, a, proton, h, donor, and, a, base, is, a, proton, acceptor, when, reacting, with, a, stronger, acid, water, acts, as, a, base, when, reacting, with, a, stronger, base, it, acts, as, an, acid, for, instance, water, receives, an, h, ion, from, hcl, when, hydrochloric, acid, is, formed, in, the, reaction, with, ammonia, nh, 3, water, donates, a, h, ion, and, is, thus, acting, as, an, acid, because, the, oxygen, atom, in, water, has, two, lone, pairs, water, often, acts, as, a, lewis, base, or, electron, pair, donor, in, reactions, with, lewis, acids, although, it, can, also, react, with, lewis, bases, forming, hydrogen, bonds, between, the, electron, pair, donors, and, the, hydrogen, atoms, of, water, hsab, theory, describes, water, as, both, a, weak, hard, acid, and, a, weak, hard, base, meaning, that, it, reacts, preferentially, with, other, hard, species, when, a, salt, of, a, weak, acid, or, of, a, weak, base, is, dissolved, in, water, water, can, partially, hydrolyze, the, salt, producing, the, corresponding, base, or, acid, which, gives, aqueous, solutions, of, soap, and, baking, soda, their, basic, ph, water, s, lewis, base, character, makes, it, a, common, ligand, in, transition, metal, complexes, examples, of, which, include, metal, aquo, complexes, such, as, fe, h, 2, o, 2, 6, to, perrhenic, acid, which, contains, two, water, molecules, coordinated, to, a, rhenium, center, in, solid, hydrates, water, can, be, either, a, ligand, or, simply, lodged, in, the, framework, or, both, thus, feso, 4, 7h, 2, o, consists, of, 2, centers, and, one, lattice, water, water, is, typically, a, monodentate, ligand, i, e, it, forms, only, one, bond, with, the, central, atom, as, a, hard, base, water, reacts, readily, with, organic, carbocations, for, example, in, a, hydration, reaction, a, hydroxyl, group, oh, and, an, acidic, proton, are, added, to, the, two, carbon, atoms, bonded, together, in, the, carbon, carbon, double, bond, resulting, in, an, alcohol, when, the, addition, of, water, to, an, organic, molecule, cleaves, the, molecule, in, two, hydrolysis, is, said, to, occur, notable, examples, of, hydrolysis, are, the, saponification, of, fats, and, the, digestion, of, proteins, and, polysaccharides, water, can, also, be, a, leaving, group, in, s, n, 2, substitution, and, e2, elimination, reactions, the, latter, is, then, known, as, a, dehydration, reaction, water, contains, hydrogen, in, the, oxidation, state, 1, and, oxygen, in, the, oxidation, state, 2, it, oxidizes, chemicals, such, as, hydrides, alkali, metals, and, some, alkaline, earth, metals, one, example, of, an, alkali, metal, reacting, with, water, is, some, other, reactive, metals, such, as, aluminium, and, beryllium, are, oxidized, by, water, as, well, but, their, oxides, adhere, to, the, metal, and, form, a, passive, protective, layer, note, that, the, rusting, of, iron, is, a, reaction, between, iron, and, oxygen, that, is, dissolved, in, water, not, between, iron, and, water, water, can, be, oxidized, to, emit, oxygen, gas, but, very, few, oxidants, react, with, water, even, if, their, reduction, potential, is, greater, than, the, potential, of, o, 2, h, 2, o, almost, all, such, reactions, require, a, catalyst, an, example, of, the, oxidation, of, water, is, water, can, be, split, into, its, constituent, elements, hydrogen, and, oxygen, by, passing, an, electric, current, through, it, this, process, is, called, electrolysis, the, cathode, half, reaction, is, the, anode, half, reaction, is, the, gases, produced, bubble, to, the, surface, where, they, can, be, collected, or, ignited, with, a, flame, above, the, water, if, this, was, the, intention, the, required, potential, for, the, electrolysis, of, pure, water, is, 1, 23, v, at, 25, c, the, operating, potential, is, actually, 1, 48, v, or, higher, in, practical, electrolysis, henry, cavendish, showed, that, water, was, composed, of, oxygen, and, hydrogen, in, 1781, the, first, decomposition, of, water, into, hydrogen, and, oxygen, by, electrolysis, was, done, in, 1800, by, english, chemist, william, nicholson, and, anthony, carlisle, in, 1805, joseph, louis, gay, lussac, and, alexander, von, humboldt, showed, that, water, is, composed, of, two, parts, hydrogen, and, one, part, oxygen, gilbert, newton, lewis, isolated, the, first, sample, of, pure, heavy, water, in, 1933, the, properties, of, water, have, historically, been, used, to, define, various, temperature, scales, notably, the, kelvin, celsius, rankine, and, fahrenheit, scales, were, or, currently, are, defined, by, the, freezing, and, boiling, points, of, water, the, less, common, scales, of, delisle, newton, r, aumur, and, r, mer, were, defined, similarly, the, triple, point, of, water, is, a, more, commonly, used, standard, point, today, the, accepted, iupac, name, of, water, is, oxidane, or, simply, water, or, its, equivalent, in, different, languages, although, there, are, other, systematic, names, which, can, be, used, to, describe, the, molecule, oxidane, is, only, intended, to, be, used, as, the, name, of, the, mononuclear, parent, hydride, used, for, naming, derivatives, of, water, by, substituent, nomenclature, these, derivatives, commonly, have, other, recommended, names, for, example, the, name, hydroxyl, is, recommended, over, oxidanyl, for, the, oh, group, the, name, oxane, is, explicitly, mentioned, by, the, iupac, as, being, unsuitable, for, this, purpose, since, it, is, already, the, name, of, a, cyclic, ether, also, known, as, tetrahydropyran, the, simplest, systematic, name, of, water, is, hydrogen, oxide, this, is, analogous, to, related, compounds, such, as, hydrogen, peroxide, hydrogen, sulfide, and, deuterium, oxide, heavy, water, using, chemical, nomenclature, for, type, i, ionic, binary, compounds, water, would, take, the, name, hydrogen, monoxide, but, this, is, not, among, the, names, published, by, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, iupac, another, name, is, dihydrogen, monoxide, which, is, a, rarely, used, name, of, water, and, mostly, used, in, the, dihydrogen, monoxide, parody, other, systematic, names, for, water, include, hydroxic, acid, hydroxylic, acid, and, hydrogen, hydroxide, using, acid, and, base, names, none, of, these, exotic, names, are, used, widely, the, polarized, form, of, the, water, molecule, h, oh, is, also, called, hydron, hydroxide, by, iupac, nomenclature, water, substance, is, a, term, used, for, hydrogen, oxide, h, 2, o, when, one, does, not, wish, to, specify, whether, one, is, speaking, of, liquid, water, steam, some, form, of, ice, or, a, component, in, a, mixture, or, mineral
