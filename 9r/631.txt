an, alluvial, fan, is, an, accumulation, of, sediments, that, fans, outwards, from, a, concentrated, source, of, sediments, such, as, a, narrow, canyon, emerging, from, an, escarpment, they, are, characteristic, of, mountainous, terrain, in, arid, to, semiarid, climates, but, are, also, found, in, more, humid, environments, subject, to, intense, rainfall, and, in, areas, of, modern, glaciation, they, range, in, area, from, less, than, 1, square, kilometer, 0, 4, sq, mi, to, almost, 20, 000, square, kilometers, 7, 700, sq, mi, alluvial, fans, typically, form, where, flow, emerges, from, a, confined, channel, and, is, free, to, spread, out, and, infiltrate, the, surface, this, reduces, the, carrying, capacity, of, the, flow, and, results, in, deposition, of, sediments, the, flow, can, take, the, form, of, infrequent, debris, flows, or, one, or, more, ephemeral, or, perennial, streams, alluvial, fans, are, common, in, the, geologic, record, such, as, in, the, triassic, basins, of, eastern, north, america, and, the, new, red, sandstone, of, south, devon, such, fan, deposits, likely, contain, the, largest, accumulations, of, gravel, in, the, geologic, record, alluvial, fans, have, also, been, found, on, mars, and, titan, showing, that, fluvial, processes, have, occurred, on, other, worlds, some, of, the, largest, alluvial, fans, are, found, along, the, himalaya, mountain, front, on, the, indo, gangetic, plain, a, shift, of, the, feeder, channel, a, nodal, avulsion, can, lead, to, catastrophic, flooding, as, occurred, on, the, kosi, river, fan, in, 2008, an, alluvial, fan, is, an, accumulation, of, sediments, that, fans, out, from, a, concentrated, source, of, sediments, such, as, a, narrow, canyon, emerging, from, an, escarpment, this, accumulation, is, shaped, like, a, section, of, a, shallow, cone, with, its, apex, at, the, source, of, sediments, alluvial, fans, vary, greatly, in, size, from, only, a, few, meters, across, at, the, base, to, as, much, as, 150, kilometers, across, with, a, slope, of, 1, 5, to, 25, degrees, some, giant, alluvial, fans, have, areas, of, almost, 20, 000, square, kilometres, 7, 700, sq, mi, the, slope, measured, from, the, apex, is, generally, concave, with, the, steepest, slope, near, the, apex, the, proximal, fan, or, fanhead, and, becoming, less, steep, further, out, the, medial, fan, or, midfan, and, shallowing, at, the, edges, of, the, fan, the, distal, fan, or, outer, fan, sieve, deposits, which, are, lobes, of, coarse, gravel, may, be, present, on, the, proximal, fan, the, sediments, in, an, alluvial, fan, are, usually, coarse, and, poorly, sorted, with, the, coarsest, sediments, found, on, the, proximal, fan, when, there, is, enough, space, in, the, alluvial, plain, for, all, of, the, sediment, deposits, to, fan, out, without, contacting, other, valley, walls, or, rivers, an, unconfined, alluvial, fan, develops, unconfined, alluvial, fans, allow, sediments, to, naturally, fan, out, and, the, shape, of, the, fan, is, not, influenced, by, other, topological, features, when, the, alluvial, plain, is, more, restricted, so, that, the, fan, comes, into, contact, with, topographic, barriers, a, confined, fan, is, formed, wave, or, channel, erosion, of, the, edge, of, the, fan, lateral, erosion, sometimes, produces, a, toe, trimmed, fan, in, which, the, edge, of, the, fan, is, marked, by, a, small, escarpment, toe, trimmed, fans, may, record, climate, changes, or, tectonic, processes, and, the, process, of, lateral, erosion, may, enhance, the, aquifer, or, petroleum, reservoir, potential, of, the, fan, toe, trimmed, fans, on, the, planet, mars, provide, evidence, of, past, river, systems, when, numerous, rivers, and, streams, exit, a, mountain, front, onto, a, plain, the, fans, can, combine, to, form, a, continuous, apron, this, is, referred, to, as, a, bajada, or, piedmont, alluvial, plain, alluvial, fans, usually, form, where, a, confined, feeder, channel, exits, a, mountain, front, or, a, glacier, margin, as, the, flow, exits, the, feeder, channel, onto, the, fan, surface, it, is, able, to, spread, out, into, wide, shallow, channels, or, to, infiltrate, the, surface, this, reduces, the, carrying, power, of, the, flow, and, results, in, deposition, of, sediments, flow, in, the, proximal, fan, where, the, slope, is, steepest, is, usually, confined, to, a, single, channel, a, fanhead, trench, which, may, be, up, to, 30, meters, 100, ft, deep, this, channel, is, subject, to, blockage, by, accumulated, sediments, or, debris, flows, which, causes, flow, to, periodically, break, out, of, its, old, channel, nodal, avulsion, and, shift, to, a, part, of, the, fan, with, a, steeper, gradient, where, deposition, resumes, as, a, result, normally, only, part, of, the, fan, is, active, at, any, particular, time, and, the, bypassed, areas, may, undergo, soil, formation, or, erosion, alluvial, fans, can, be, dominated, by, debris, flows, debris, flow, fans, or, stream, flow, fluvial, fans, which, kind, of, fan, is, formed, is, controlled, by, climate, tectonics, and, the, type, of, bedrock, in, the, area, feeding, the, flow, onto, the, fan, debris, flow, fans, receive, most, of, their, sediments, in, the, form, of, debris, flows, debris, flows, are, slurry, like, mixtures, of, water, and, particles, of, all, sizes, from, clay, to, boulders, that, resemble, wet, concrete, they, are, characterized, by, having, a, yield, strength, meaning, that, they, are, highly, viscous, at, low, flow, velocities, but, become, less, viscous, as, the, flow, velocity, increases, this, means, that, a, debris, flow, can, come, to, a, halt, while, still, on, moderately, tilted, ground, the, flow, then, becomes, consolidated, under, its, own, weight, debris, flow, fans, occur, in, all, climates, but, are, more, common, where, the, source, rock, is, mudstone, or, matrix, rich, saprolite, rather, than, coarser, more, permeable, regolith, the, abundance, of, fine, grained, sediments, encourages, the, initial, hillslope, failure, and, subsequent, cohesive, flow, of, debris, saturation, of, clay, rich, colluvium, by, locally, intense, thunderstorms, initiates, slope, failure, the, resulting, debris, flow, travels, down, the, feeder, channel, and, onto, the, surface, of, the, fan, debris, flow, fans, have, a, network, of, mostly, inactive, distributary, channels, in, the, upper, fan, that, gives, way, to, mid, to, lower, level, lobes, the, channels, tend, to, be, filled, by, subsequent, cohesive, debris, flows, usually, only, one, lobe, is, active, at, a, time, and, inactive, lobes, may, develop, desert, varnish, or, develop, a, soil, profile, from, eolian, dust, deposition, on, time, scales, of, 1, 000, to, 10, 000, years, because, of, their, high, viscosity, debris, flows, tend, to, be, confined, to, the, proximal, and, medial, fan, even, in, a, debris, flow, dominated, alluvial, fan, and, streamfloods, dominate, the, distal, fan, however, some, debris, flow, dominated, fans, in, arid, climates, consist, almost, entirely, of, debris, flows, and, lag, gravels, from, eolian, winnowing, of, debris, flows, with, no, evidence, of, sheetflood, or, sieve, deposits, debris, flow, dominated, fans, tend, to, be, steep, and, poorly, vegetated, fluvial, fans, streamflow, dominated, fans, receive, most, of, their, sediments, in, the, form, of, stream, flow, rather, than, debris, flows, they, are, less, sharply, distinguished, from, ordinary, fluvial, deposits, than, are, debris, flow, fans, fluvial, fans, occur, where, there, is, perennial, seasonal, or, ephemeral, stream, flow, that, feeds, a, system, of, distributary, channels, on, the, fan, in, arid, or, semiarid, climates, deposition, is, dominated, by, infrequent, but, intense, rainfall, that, produces, flash, floods, in, the, feeder, channel, this, results, in, sheetfloods, on, the, alluvial, fan, where, sediment, laden, water, leaves, its, channel, confines, and, spreads, across, the, fan, surface, these, may, include, hyperconcentrated, flows, containing, 20, to, 45, sediments, which, are, intermediate, between, sheetfloods, having, 20, or, less, of, sediments, and, debris, flows, with, more, than, 45, sediments, as, the, flood, recedes, it, often, leaves, a, lag, of, gravel, deposits, that, have, the, appearance, of, a, network, of, braided, streams, where, the, flow, is, more, continuous, as, with, spring, snow, melt, incised, channel, flow, in, channels, 1, 4, meters, 3, 10, ft, high, takes, place, in, a, network, of, braided, streams, such, alluvial, fans, tend, to, have, a, shallower, slope, but, can, become, enormous, the, kosi, and, other, fans, along, the, himalaya, mountain, front, in, the, indo, gangetic, plain, are, examples, of, gigantic, stream, flow, dominated, alluvial, fans, sometimes, described, as, megafans, here, continued, movement, on, the, main, boundary, thrust, over, the, last, ten, million, years, has, focused, the, drainage, of, 750, kilometres, 470, mi, of, mountain, frontage, into, just, three, enormous, fans, alluvial, fans, are, common, in, the, geologic, record, but, may, have, been, particularly, important, before, the, evolution, of, land, plants, in, the, mid, paleozoic, they, are, characteristic, of, fault, bounded, basins, and, can, be, 5, 000, meters, 16, 000, ft, or, thicker, due, to, tectonic, subsidence, of, the, basin, and, uplift, of, the, mountain, front, most, are, red, from, hematite, produced, by, diagenetic, alteration, of, iron, rich, minerals, in, a, shallow, oxidizing, environment, examples, of, paleofans, include, the, triassic, basins, of, eastern, north, america, and, the, new, red, sandstone, of, south, devon, the, devonian, hornelen, basin, of, norway, and, the, devonian, carboniferous, in, the, gasp, peninsula, of, canada, such, fan, deposit, likely, contain, the, largest, accumulations, of, gravel, in, the, geologic, record, several, kinds, of, sediment, deposits, facies, are, found, in, alluvial, fans, alluvial, fans, are, characterized, by, coarse, sedimentation, though, the, sediments, making, up, the, fan, become, less, coarse, further, from, the, apex, gravels, show, well, developed, imbrication, with, the, pebbles, dipping, towards, the, apex, fan, deposits, typically, show, well, developed, reverse, grading, caused, by, outbuilding, of, the, fan, finer, sediments, are, deposited, at, the, edge, of, the, fan, but, as, the, fan, continues, to, grow, increasingly, coarse, sediments, are, deposited, on, top, of, the, earlier, less, coarse, sediments, however, a, few, fans, show, normal, grading, indicating, inactivity, or, even, fan, retreat, so, that, increasingly, fine, sediments, are, deposited, on, earlier, coarser, sediments, normal, or, reverse, grading, sequences, can, be, hundreds, to, thousands, of, meters, in, thickness, depositional, facies, that, have, been, reported, for, alluvial, fans, include, debris, flows, sheet, floods, and, upper, regime, stream, floods, sieve, deposits, and, braided, stream, flows, each, leaving, their, own, characteristic, sediment, deposits, that, can, be, identified, by, geologists, debris, flow, deposits, are, common, in, the, proximal, and, medial, fan, these, deposits, lack, sedimentary, structure, other, than, occasional, reverse, graded, bedding, towards, the, base, and, they, are, poorly, sorted, the, proximal, fan, may, also, include, gravel, lobes, that, have, been, interpreted, as, sieve, deposits, where, runoff, rapidly, infiltrates, and, leaves, behind, only, the, coarse, material, however, the, gravel, lobes, have, also, been, interpreted, as, debris, flow, deposits, conglomerate, originating, as, debris, flows, on, alluvial, fans, is, described, as, fanglomerate, stream, flow, deposits, tend, to, be, sheetlike, better, sorted, than, debris, flow, deposits, and, sometimes, show, well, developed, sedimentary, structures, such, as, cross, bedding, these, are, more, prevalent, in, the, medial, and, distal, fan, in, the, distal, fan, where, channels, are, very, shallow, and, braided, stream, flow, deposits, consist, of, sandy, interbeds, with, planar, and, trough, slanted, stratification, the, medial, fan, of, a, streamflow, dominated, alluvial, fan, shows, nearly, the, same, depositional, facies, as, ordinary, fluvial, environments, so, that, identification, of, ancient, alluvial, fans, must, be, based, on, radial, paleomorphology, in, a, piedmont, setting, alluvial, fans, are, characteristic, of, mountainous, terrain, in, arid, to, semiarid, climates, but, are, also, found, in, more, humid, environments, subject, to, intense, rainfall, and, in, areas, of, modern, glaciation, they, have, also, been, found, on, other, bodies, of, the, solar, system, alluvial, fans, are, built, in, response, to, erosion, induced, by, tectonic, uplift, the, upwards, coarsening, of, the, beds, making, up, the, fan, reflects, cycles, of, erosion, in, the, highlands, that, feed, sediments, to, the, fan, however, climate, and, changes, in, base, level, may, be, as, important, as, tectonic, uplift, for, example, alluvial, fans, in, the, himalayas, show, older, fans, entrenched, and, overlain, by, younger, fans, the, younger, fans, in, turn, are, cut, by, deep, incised, valleys, showing, two, terrace, levels, dating, via, optically, stimulated, luminescence, suggests, a, hiatus, of, 70, 000, to, 80, 000, years, between, the, old, and, new, fans, with, evidence, of, tectonic, tilting, at, 45, 000, years, ago, and, an, end, to, fan, deposition, 20, 000, years, ago, both, the, hiatus, and, the, more, recent, end, to, fan, deposition, are, thought, to, be, connected, to, periods, of, enhanced, southwest, monsoon, precipitation, climate, has, also, influenced, fan, formation, in, death, valley, california, us, where, dating, of, beds, suggests, that, peaks, of, fan, deposition, during, the, last, 25, 000, years, occurred, during, times, of, rapid, climate, change, both, from, wet, to, dry, and, from, dry, to, wet, alluvial, fans, are, often, found, in, desert, areas, which, are, subjected, to, periodic, flash, floods, from, nearby, thunderstorms, in, local, hills, the, typical, watercourse, in, an, arid, climate, has, a, large, funnel, shaped, basin, at, the, top, leading, to, a, narrow, defile, which, opens, out, into, an, alluvial, fan, at, the, bottom, multiple, braided, streams, are, usually, present, and, active, during, water, flows, phreatophytes, plants, with, long, tap, roots, capable, of, reaching, a, deep, water, table, are, sometimes, found, in, sinuous, lines, radiating, from, arid, climate, fan, toes, these, fan, toe, phreatophyte, strips, trace, buried, channels, of, coarse, sediments, from, the, fan, that, have, interfingered, with, impermeable, playa, sediments, alluvial, fans, also, develop, in, wetter, climates, when, high, relief, terrain, is, located, adjacent, to, low, relief, terrain, in, nepal, the, koshi, river, has, built, a, megafan, covering, some, 15, 000, km, 2, 5, 800, sq, mi, below, its, exit, from, himalayan, foothills, onto, the, nearly, level, plains, where, the, river, traverses, into, india, before, joining, the, ganges, along, the, upper, koshi, tributaries, tectonic, forces, elevate, the, himalayas, several, millimeters, annually, uplift, is, approximately, in, equilibrium, with, erosion, so, the, river, annually, carries, some, 100, million, cubic, meters, 3, 5, 10, 9, cu, ft, of, sediment, as, it, exits, the, mountains, deposition, of, this, magnitude, over, millions, of, years, is, more, than, sufficient, to, account, for, the, megafan, in, north, america, streams, flowing, into, california, s, central, valley, have, deposited, smaller, but, still, extensive, alluvial, fans, such, as, that, of, the, kings, river, flowing, out, of, the, sierra, nevada, like, the, himalayan, megafans, these, are, streamflow, dominated, fans, alluvial, fans, are, also, found, on, mars, unlike, alluvial, fans, on, earth, those, on, mars, are, rarely, associated, with, tectonic, processes, but, are, much, more, common, on, crater, rims, the, crater, rim, alluvial, fans, appear, to, have, been, deposited, by, sheetflow, rather, than, debris, flows, three, alluvial, fans, have, been, found, in, saheki, crater, these, fans, confirmed, past, fluvial, flow, on, the, planet, and, further, supported, the, theory, that, liquid, water, was, once, present, in, some, form, on, the, martian, surface, in, addition, observations, of, fans, in, gale, crater, made, by, satellites, from, orbit, have, now, been, confirmed, by, the, discovery, of, fluvial, sediments, by, the, curiosity, rover, alluvial, fans, in, holden, crater, have, toe, trimmed, profiles, attributed, to, fluvial, erosion, the, few, alluvial, fans, associated, with, tectonic, processes, include, those, at, coprates, chasma, and, juventae, chasma, which, are, part, of, the, valles, marineris, canyon, system, these, provide, evidence, of, the, existence, and, nature, of, faulting, in, this, region, of, mars, alluvial, fans, have, been, observed, by, the, cassini, huygens, mission, on, titan, using, the, cassini, orbiter, s, synthetic, aperture, radar, instrument, these, fans, are, more, common, in, the, drier, mid, latitudes, at, the, end, of, methane, ethane, rivers, where, it, is, thought, that, frequent, wetting, and, drying, occur, due, to, precipitation, much, like, arid, fans, on, earth, radar, imaging, suggests, that, fan, material, is, most, likely, composed, of, round, grains, of, water, ice, or, solid, organic, compounds, about, two, centimeters, in, diameter, alluvial, fans, are, the, most, important, groundwater, reservoirs, in, many, regions, many, urban, industrial, and, agricultural, areas, are, located, on, alluvial, fans, including, the, conurbations, of, los, angeles, california, salt, lake, city, utah, and, denver, colorado, in, the, western, united, states, and, in, many, other, parts, of, the, world, however, flooding, on, alluvial, fans, poses, unique, problems, for, disaster, prevention, and, preparation, the, beds, of, coarse, sediments, associated, with, alluvial, fans, form, aquifers, that, are, the, most, important, groundwater, reservoirs, in, many, regions, these, include, both, arid, regions, such, as, egypt, or, iraq, and, humid, regions, such, as, central, europe, or, taiwan, alluvial, fans, are, subject, to, infrequent, but, often, very, damaging, flooding, whose, unusual, characteristics, distinguish, alluvial, fan, floods, from, ordinary, riverbank, flooding, these, include, great, uncertainty, in, the, likely, flood, path, the, likelihood, of, abrupt, deposition, and, erosion, of, sediments, carried, by, the, flood, from, upstream, sources, and, a, combination, of, the, availability, of, sediments, and, of, the, slope, and, topography, of, the, fan, that, creates, extraordinary, hazards, these, hazards, cannot, reliably, be, mitigated, by, elevation, on, fill, raising, existing, buildings, up, to, a, meter, three, feet, and, building, new, foundations, beneath, them, at, a, minimum, major, structural, flood, control, measures, are, required, to, mitigate, risk, and, in, some, cases, the, only, alternative, is, to, restrict, development, on, the, fan, surface, such, measures, can, be, politically, controversial, particularly, since, the, hazard, is, not, obvious, to, property, owners, in, the, united, states, areas, at, risk, of, alluvial, fan, flooding, are, marked, as, zone, ao, on, flood, insurance, rate, maps, alluvial, fan, flooding, commonly, takes, the, form, of, short, several, hours, but, energetic, flash, floods, that, occur, with, little, or, no, warning, they, typically, result, from, heavy, and, prolonged, rainfall, and, are, characterized, by, high, velocities, and, capacity, for, sediment, transport, flows, cover, the, range, from, floods, through, hyperconcentrated, flows, to, debris, flows, depending, on, the, volume, of, sediments, in, the, flow, debris, flows, resemble, freshly, poured, concrete, consisting, mostly, of, coarse, debris, hyperconcentrated, flows, are, intermediate, between, floods, and, debris, flows, with, a, water, content, between, 40, and, 80, weight, percent, floods, may, transition, to, hyperconcentrated, flows, as, they, entrain, sediments, while, debris, flows, may, become, hyperconcentrated, flows, if, they, are, diluted, by, water, because, flooding, on, alluvial, fans, carries, large, quantities, of, sediment, channels, can, rapidly, become, blocked, creating, great, uncertainty, about, flow, paths, that, magnifies, the, dangers, alluvial, fan, flooding, in, the, apennine, mountains, of, italy, have, resulted, in, repeated, loss, of, life, a, flood, on, 1, october, 1581, at, piedimonte, matese, resulted, in, the, loss, of, 400, lives, loss, of, life, from, alluvial, fan, floods, continued, into, the, 19th, century, and, the, hazard, of, alluvial, fan, flooding, remains, a, concern, in, italy, on, january, 1, 1934, record, rainfall, in, a, recently, burned, area, of, the, san, gabriel, mountains, california, caused, severe, flooding, of, the, alluvial, fan, on, which, the, towns, of, montrose, and, glendale, were, built, the, floods, caused, significant, loss, of, life, and, property, the, koshi, river, in, india, has, built, up, a, megafan, where, it, exits, the, himalayas, onto, the, ganges, plain, the, river, has, a, history, of, frequently, and, capriciously, changing, its, course, so, that, it, has, been, called, the, sorrow, of, bihar, for, contributing, disproportionately, to, india, s, death, tolls, in, flooding, these, exceed, those, of, all, countries, except, bangladesh, over, the, last, few, hundred, years, the, river, had, generally, shifted, westward, across, its, fan, and, by, 2008, the, main, river, channel, was, located, on, the, extreme, western, part, of, the, megafan, in, august, 2008, high, monsoon, flows, breached, the, embankment, of, the, koshi, river, this, diverted, most, of, the, river, into, an, unprotected, ancient, channel, and, flooded, the, central, part, of, the, megafan, this, was, an, area, with, a, high, population, density, that, had, been, stable, for, over, 200, years, over, a, million, people, were, rendered, homeless, about, a, thousand, lost, their, lives, and, thousands, of, hectares, of, crops, were, destroyed, buried, alluvial, fans, are, sometimes, found, at, the, margins, of, petroleum, basins, debris, flow, fans, make, poor, petroleum, reservoirs, but, fluvial, fans, are, potentially, significant, reservoirs, though, fluvial, fans, are, typically, of, poorer, quality, than, reservoirs, closer, to, the, basin, center, due, to, their, complex, structure, the, episodic, flooding, channels, of, the, fans, are, potentially, lucrative, targets, for, petroleum, exploration, alluvial, fans, that, experience, toe, trimming, lateral, erosion, by, an, axial, river, a, river, running, the, length, of, an, escarpment, bounded, basin, may, have, increased, potential, as, reservoirs, the, river, deposits, relatively, porous, permeable, axial, river, sediments, that, alternate, with, fan, sediment, beds
