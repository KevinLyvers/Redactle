heat, transfer, is, a, discipline, of, thermal, engineering, that, concerns, the, generation, use, conversion, and, exchange, of, thermal, energy, heat, between, physical, systems, heat, transfer, is, classified, into, various, mechanisms, such, as, thermal, conduction, thermal, convection, thermal, radiation, and, transfer, of, energy, by, phase, changes, engineers, also, consider, the, transfer, of, mass, of, differing, chemical, species, mass, transfer, in, the, form, of, advection, either, cold, or, hot, to, achieve, heat, transfer, while, these, mechanisms, have, distinct, characteristics, they, often, occur, simultaneously, in, the, same, system, heat, conduction, also, called, diffusion, is, the, direct, microscopic, exchanges, of, kinetic, energy, of, particles, such, as, molecules, or, quasiparticles, such, as, lattice, waves, through, the, boundary, between, two, systems, when, an, object, is, at, a, different, temperature, from, another, body, or, its, surroundings, heat, flows, so, that, the, body, and, the, surroundings, reach, the, same, temperature, at, which, point, they, are, in, thermal, equilibrium, such, spontaneous, heat, transfer, always, occurs, from, a, region, of, high, temperature, to, another, region, of, lower, temperature, as, described, in, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, heat, convection, occurs, when, the, bulk, flow, of, a, fluid, gas, or, liquid, carries, its, heat, through, the, fluid, all, convective, processes, also, move, heat, partly, by, diffusion, as, well, the, flow, of, fluid, may, be, forced, by, external, processes, or, sometimes, in, gravitational, fields, by, buoyancy, forces, caused, when, thermal, energy, expands, the, fluid, for, example, in, a, fire, plume, thus, influencing, its, own, transfer, the, latter, process, is, often, called, natural, convection, the, former, process, is, often, called, forced, convection, in, this, case, the, fluid, is, forced, to, flow, by, use, of, a, pump, fan, or, other, mechanical, means, thermal, radiation, occurs, through, a, vacuum, or, any, transparent, medium, solid, or, fluid, or, gas, it, is, the, transfer, of, energy, by, means, of, photons, or, electromagnetic, waves, governed, by, the, same, laws, heat, transfer, is, the, energy, exchanged, between, materials, solid, liquid, gas, as, a, result, of, a, temperature, difference, the, thermodynamic, free, energy, is, the, amount, of, work, that, a, thermodynamic, system, can, perform, enthalpy, is, a, thermodynamic, potential, designated, by, the, letter, h, that, is, the, sum, of, the, internal, energy, of, the, system, u, plus, the, product, of, pressure, p, and, volume, v, joule, is, a, unit, to, quantify, energy, work, or, the, amount, of, heat, heat, transfer, is, a, process, function, or, path, function, as, opposed, to, functions, of, state, therefore, the, amount, of, heat, transferred, in, a, thermodynamic, process, that, changes, the, state, of, a, system, depends, on, how, that, process, occurs, not, only, the, net, difference, between, the, initial, and, final, states, of, the, process, thermodynamic, and, mechanical, heat, transfer, is, calculated, with, the, heat, transfer, coefficient, the, proportionality, between, the, heat, flux, and, the, thermodynamic, driving, force, for, the, flow, of, heat, heat, flux, is, a, quantitative, vectorial, representation, of, heat, flow, through, a, surface, in, engineering, contexts, the, term, heat, is, taken, as, synonymous, with, thermal, energy, this, usage, has, its, origin, in, the, historical, interpretation, of, heat, as, a, fluid, caloric, that, can, be, transferred, by, various, causes, and, that, is, also, common, in, the, language, of, laymen, and, everyday, life, the, transport, equations, for, thermal, energy, fourier, s, law, mechanical, momentum, newton, s, law, for, fluids, and, mass, transfer, fick, s, laws, of, diffusion, are, similar, and, analogies, among, these, three, transport, processes, have, been, developed, to, facilitate, the, prediction, of, conversion, from, any, one, to, the, others, thermal, engineering, concerns, the, generation, use, conversion, storage, and, exchange, of, heat, transfer, as, such, heat, transfer, is, involved, in, almost, every, sector, of, the, economy, heat, transfer, is, classified, into, various, mechanisms, such, as, thermal, conduction, thermal, convection, thermal, radiation, and, transfer, of, energy, by, phase, changes, the, fundamental, modes, of, heat, transfer, are, by, transferring, matter, energy, including, thermal, energy, is, moved, by, the, physical, transfer, of, a, hot, or, cold, object, from, one, place, to, another, this, can, be, as, simple, as, placing, hot, water, in, a, bottle, and, heating, a, bed, or, the, movement, of, an, iceberg, in, changing, ocean, currents, a, practical, example, is, thermal, hydraulics, this, can, be, described, by, the, formula, q, v, c, p, t, displaystyle, phi, q, v, rho, c, p, delta, t, where, on, a, microscopic, scale, heat, conduction, occurs, as, hot, rapidly, moving, or, vibrating, atoms, and, molecules, interact, with, neighboring, atoms, and, molecules, transferring, some, of, their, energy, heat, to, these, neighboring, particles, in, other, words, heat, is, transferred, by, conduction, when, adjacent, atoms, vibrate, against, one, another, or, as, electrons, move, from, one, atom, to, another, conduction, is, the, most, significant, means, of, heat, transfer, within, a, solid, or, between, solid, objects, in, thermal, contact, fluids, especially, gases, are, less, conductive, thermal, contact, conductance, is, the, study, of, heat, conduction, between, solid, bodies, in, contact, the, process, of, heat, transfer, from, one, place, to, another, place, without, the, movement, of, particles, is, called, conduction, such, as, when, placing, a, hand, on, a, cold, glass, of, water, heat, is, conducted, from, the, warm, skin, to, the, cold, glass, but, if, the, hand, is, held, a, few, inches, from, the, glass, little, conduction, would, occur, since, air, is, a, poor, conductor, of, heat, steady, state, conduction, is, an, idealized, model, of, conduction, that, happens, when, the, temperature, difference, driving, the, conduction, is, constant, so, that, after, a, time, the, spatial, distribution, of, temperatures, in, the, conducting, object, does, not, change, any, further, see, fourier, s, law, in, steady, state, conduction, the, amount, of, heat, entering, a, section, is, equal, to, amount, of, heat, coming, out, since, the, temperature, change, a, measure, of, heat, energy, is, zero, an, example, of, steady, state, conduction, is, the, heat, flow, through, walls, of, a, warm, house, on, a, cold, day, inside, the, house, is, maintained, at, a, high, temperature, and, outside, the, temperature, stays, low, so, the, transfer, of, heat, per, unit, time, stays, near, a, constant, rate, determined, by, the, insulation, in, the, wall, and, the, spatial, distribution, of, temperature, in, the, walls, will, be, approximately, constant, over, time, transient, conduction, see, heat, equation, occurs, when, the, temperature, within, an, object, changes, as, a, function, of, time, analysis, of, transient, systems, is, more, complex, and, analytic, solutions, of, the, heat, equation, are, only, valid, for, idealized, model, systems, practical, applications, are, generally, investigated, using, numerical, methods, approximation, techniques, or, empirical, study, the, flow, of, fluid, may, be, forced, by, external, processes, or, sometimes, in, gravitational, fields, by, buoyancy, forces, caused, when, thermal, energy, expands, the, fluid, for, example, in, a, fire, plume, thus, influencing, its, own, transfer, the, latter, process, is, often, called, natural, convection, all, convective, processes, also, move, heat, partly, by, diffusion, as, well, another, form, of, convection, is, forced, convection, in, this, case, the, fluid, is, forced, to, flow, by, using, a, pump, fan, or, other, mechanical, means, convective, heat, transfer, or, simply, convection, is, the, transfer, of, heat, from, one, place, to, another, by, the, movement, of, fluids, a, process, that, is, essentially, the, transfer, of, heat, via, mass, transfer, the, bulk, motion, of, fluid, enhances, heat, transfer, in, many, physical, situations, such, as, between, a, solid, surface, and, the, fluid, convection, is, usually, the, dominant, form, of, heat, transfer, in, liquids, and, gases, although, sometimes, discussed, as, a, third, method, of, heat, transfer, convection, is, usually, used, to, describe, the, combined, effects, of, heat, conduction, within, the, fluid, diffusion, and, heat, transference, by, bulk, fluid, flow, streaming, the, process, of, transport, by, fluid, streaming, is, known, as, advection, but, pure, advection, is, a, term, that, is, generally, associated, only, with, mass, transport, in, fluids, such, as, advection, of, pebbles, in, a, river, in, the, case, of, heat, transfer, in, fluids, where, transport, by, advection, in, a, fluid, is, always, also, accompanied, by, transport, via, heat, diffusion, also, known, as, heat, conduction, the, process, of, heat, convection, is, understood, to, refer, to, the, sum, of, heat, transport, by, advection, and, diffusion, conduction, free, or, natural, convection, occurs, when, bulk, fluid, motions, streams, and, currents, are, caused, by, buoyancy, forces, that, result, from, density, variations, due, to, variations, of, temperature, in, the, fluid, forced, convection, is, a, term, used, when, the, streams, and, currents, in, the, fluid, are, induced, by, external, means, such, as, fans, stirrers, and, pumps, creating, an, artificially, induced, convection, current, convective, cooling, is, sometimes, described, as, newton, s, law, of, cooling, the, rate, of, heat, loss, of, a, body, is, proportional, to, the, temperature, difference, between, the, body, and, its, surroundings, however, by, definition, the, validity, of, newton, s, law, of, cooling, requires, that, the, rate, of, heat, loss, from, convection, be, a, linear, function, of, proportional, to, the, temperature, difference, that, drives, heat, transfer, and, in, convective, cooling, this, is, sometimes, not, the, case, in, general, convection, is, not, linearly, dependent, on, temperature, gradients, and, in, some, cases, is, strongly, nonlinear, in, these, cases, newton, s, law, does, not, apply, in, a, body, of, fluid, that, is, heated, from, underneath, its, container, conduction, and, convection, can, be, considered, to, compete, for, dominance, if, heat, conduction, is, too, great, fluid, moving, down, by, convection, is, heated, by, conduction, so, fast, that, its, downward, movement, will, be, stopped, due, to, its, buoyancy, while, fluid, moving, up, by, convection, is, cooled, by, conduction, so, fast, that, its, driving, buoyancy, will, diminish, on, the, other, hand, if, heat, conduction, is, very, low, a, large, temperature, gradient, may, be, formed, and, convection, might, be, very, strong, the, rayleigh, number, r, a, displaystyle, mathrm, ra, is, the, product, of, the, grashof, g, r, displaystyle, mathrm, gr, and, prandtl, p, r, displaystyle, mathrm, pr, numbers, it, is, a, measure, that, determines, the, relative, strength, of, conduction, and, convection, r, a, g, r, p, r, g, l, 3, g, t, l, 3, displaystyle, mathrm, ra, mathrm, gr, cdot, mathrm, pr, frac, g, delta, rho, l, 3, mu, alpha, frac, g, beta, delta, tl, 3, nu, alpha, where, the, rayleigh, number, can, be, understood, as, the, ratio, between, the, rate, of, heat, transfer, by, convection, to, the, rate, of, heat, transfer, by, conduction, or, equivalently, the, ratio, between, the, corresponding, timescales, i, e, conduction, timescale, divided, by, convection, timescale, up, to, a, numerical, factor, this, can, be, seen, as, follows, where, all, calculations, are, up, to, numerical, factors, depending, on, the, geometry, of, the, system, the, buoyancy, force, driving, the, convection, is, roughly, g, l, 3, displaystyle, g, delta, rho, l, 3, so, the, corresponding, pressure, is, roughly, g, l, displaystyle, g, delta, rho, l, in, steady, state, this, is, canceled, by, the, shear, stress, due, to, viscosity, and, therefore, roughly, equals, v, l, t, conv, displaystyle, mu, v, l, mu, t, text, conv, where, v, is, the, typical, fluid, velocity, due, to, convection, and, t, conv, displaystyle, t, text, conv, the, order, of, its, timescale, the, conduction, timescale, on, the, other, hand, is, of, the, order, of, t, cond, l, 2, displaystyle, t, text, cond, l, 2, alpha, convection, occurs, when, the, rayleigh, number, is, above, 1, 000, 2, 000, radiative, heat, transfer, is, the, transfer, of, energy, via, thermal, radiation, i, e, electromagnetic, waves, it, occurs, across, vacuum, or, any, transparent, medium, solid, or, fluid, or, gas, thermal, radiation, is, emitted, by, all, objects, at, temperatures, above, absolute, zero, due, to, random, movements, of, atoms, and, molecules, in, matter, since, these, atoms, and, molecules, are, composed, of, charged, particles, protons, and, electrons, their, movement, results, in, the, emission, of, electromagnetic, radiation, which, carries, away, energy, radiation, is, typically, only, important, in, engineering, applications, for, very, hot, objects, or, for, objects, with, a, large, temperature, difference, when, the, objects, and, distances, separating, them, are, large, in, size, and, compared, to, the, wavelength, of, thermal, radiation, the, rate, of, transfer, of, radiant, energy, is, best, described, by, the, stefan, boltzmann, equation, for, an, object, in, vacuum, the, equation, is, q, t, 4, displaystyle, phi, q, epsilon, sigma, t, 4, for, radiative, transfer, between, two, objects, the, equation, is, as, follows, q, f, t, a, 4, t, b, 4, displaystyle, phi, q, epsilon, sigma, f, t, a, 4, t, b, 4, where, the, blackbody, limit, established, by, the, stefan, boltzmann, equation, can, be, exceeded, when, the, objects, exchanging, thermal, radiation, or, the, distances, separating, them, are, comparable, in, scale, or, smaller, than, the, dominant, thermal, wavelength, the, study, of, these, cases, is, called, near, field, radiative, heat, transfer, radiation, from, the, sun, or, solar, radiation, can, be, harvested, for, heat, and, power, unlike, conductive, and, convective, forms, of, heat, transfer, thermal, radiation, arriving, within, a, narrow, angle, i, e, coming, from, a, source, much, smaller, than, its, distance, can, be, concentrated, in, a, small, spot, by, using, reflecting, mirrors, which, is, exploited, in, concentrating, solar, power, generation, or, a, burning, glass, for, example, the, sunlight, reflected, from, mirrors, heats, the, ps10, solar, power, tower, and, during, the, day, it, can, heat, water, to, 285, c, 545, f, the, reachable, temperature, at, the, target, is, limited, by, the, temperature, of, the, hot, source, of, radiation, t, 4, law, lets, the, reverse, flow, of, radiation, back, to, the, source, rise, the, on, its, surface, somewhat, 4000, k, hot, sun, allows, to, reach, coarsely, 3000, k, or, 3000, c, which, is, about, 3273, k, at, a, small, probe, in, the, focus, spot, of, a, big, concave, concentrating, mirror, of, the, mont, louis, solar, furnace, in, france, phase, transition, or, phase, change, takes, place, in, a, thermodynamic, system, from, one, phase, or, state, of, matter, to, another, one, by, heat, transfer, phase, change, examples, are, the, melting, of, ice, or, the, boiling, of, water, the, mason, equation, explains, the, growth, of, a, water, droplet, based, on, the, effects, of, heat, transport, on, evaporation, and, condensation, phase, transitions, involve, the, four, fundamental, states, of, matter, the, boiling, point, of, a, substance, is, the, temperature, at, which, the, vapor, pressure, of, the, liquid, equals, the, pressure, surrounding, the, liquid, and, the, liquid, evaporates, resulting, in, an, abrupt, change, in, vapor, volume, in, a, closed, system, saturation, temperature, and, boiling, point, mean, the, same, thing, the, saturation, temperature, is, the, temperature, for, a, corresponding, saturation, pressure, at, which, a, liquid, boils, into, its, vapor, phase, the, liquid, can, be, said, to, be, saturated, with, thermal, energy, any, addition, of, thermal, energy, results, in, a, phase, transition, at, standard, atmospheric, pressure, and, low, temperatures, no, boiling, occurs, and, the, heat, transfer, rate, is, controlled, by, the, usual, single, phase, mechanisms, as, the, surface, temperature, is, increased, local, boiling, occurs, and, vapor, bubbles, nucleate, grow, into, the, surrounding, cooler, fluid, and, collapse, this, is, sub, cooled, nucleate, boiling, and, is, a, very, efficient, heat, transfer, mechanism, at, high, bubble, generation, rates, the, bubbles, begin, to, interfere, and, the, heat, flux, no, longer, increases, rapidly, with, surface, temperature, this, is, the, departure, from, nucleate, boiling, or, dnb, at, similar, standard, atmospheric, pressure, and, high, temperatures, the, hydrodynamically, quieter, regime, of, film, boiling, is, reached, heat, fluxes, across, the, stable, vapor, layers, are, low, but, rise, slowly, with, temperature, any, contact, between, the, fluid, and, the, surface, that, may, be, seen, probably, leads, to, the, extremely, rapid, nucleation, of, a, fresh, vapor, layer, spontaneous, nucleation, at, higher, temperatures, still, a, maximum, in, the, heat, flux, is, reached, the, critical, heat, flux, or, chf, the, leidenfrost, effect, demonstrates, how, nucleate, boiling, slows, heat, transfer, due, to, gas, bubbles, on, the, heater, s, surface, as, mentioned, gas, phase, thermal, conductivity, is, much, lower, than, liquid, phase, thermal, conductivity, so, the, outcome, is, a, kind, of, gas, thermal, barrier, condensation, occurs, when, a, vapor, is, cooled, and, changes, its, phase, to, a, liquid, during, condensation, the, latent, heat, of, vaporization, must, be, released, the, amount, of, heat, is, the, same, as, that, absorbed, during, vaporization, at, the, same, fluid, pressure, there, are, several, types, of, condensation, melting, is, a, thermal, process, that, results, in, the, phase, transition, of, a, substance, from, a, solid, to, a, liquid, the, internal, energy, of, a, substance, is, increased, typically, through, heat, or, pressure, resulting, in, a, rise, of, its, temperature, to, the, melting, point, at, which, the, ordering, of, ionic, or, molecular, entities, in, the, solid, breaks, down, to, a, less, ordered, state, and, the, solid, liquefies, molten, substances, generally, have, reduced, viscosity, with, elevated, temperature, an, exception, to, this, maxim, is, the, element, sulfur, whose, viscosity, increases, to, a, point, due, to, polymerization, and, then, decreases, with, higher, temperatures, in, its, molten, state, heat, transfer, can, be, modeled, in, various, ways, the, heat, equation, is, an, important, partial, differential, equation, that, describes, the, distribution, of, heat, or, temperature, variation, in, a, given, region, over, time, in, some, cases, exact, solutions, of, the, equation, are, available, in, other, cases, the, equation, must, be, solved, numerically, using, computational, methods, such, as, dem, based, models, for, thermal, reacting, particulate, systems, as, critically, reviewed, by, peng, et, al, lumped, system, analysis, often, reduces, the, complexity, of, the, equations, to, one, first, order, linear, differential, equation, in, which, case, heating, and, cooling, are, described, by, a, simple, exponential, solution, often, referred, to, as, newton, s, law, of, cooling, system, analysis, by, the, lumped, capacitance, model, is, a, common, approximation, in, transient, conduction, that, may, be, used, whenever, heat, conduction, within, an, object, is, much, faster, than, heat, conduction, across, the, boundary, of, the, object, this, is, a, method, of, approximation, that, reduces, one, aspect, of, the, transient, conduction, system, that, within, the, object, to, an, equivalent, steady, state, system, that, is, the, method, assumes, that, the, temperature, within, the, object, is, completely, uniform, although, its, value, may, change, over, time, in, this, method, the, ratio, of, the, conductive, heat, resistance, within, the, object, to, the, convective, heat, transfer, resistance, across, the, object, s, boundary, known, as, the, biot, number, is, calculated, for, small, biot, numbers, the, approximation, of, spatially, uniform, temperature, within, the, object, can, be, used, it, can, be, presumed, that, heat, transferred, into, the, object, has, time, to, uniformly, distribute, itself, due, to, the, lower, resistance, to, doing, so, as, compared, with, the, resistance, to, heat, entering, the, object, climate, models, study, the, radiant, heat, transfer, by, using, quantitative, methods, to, simulate, the, interactions, of, the, atmosphere, oceans, land, surface, and, ice, heat, transfer, has, broad, application, to, the, functioning, of, numerous, devices, and, systems, heat, transfer, principles, may, be, used, to, preserve, increase, or, decrease, temperature, in, a, wide, variety, of, circumstances, heat, transfer, methods, are, used, in, numerous, disciplines, such, as,

measure, of, the, quantity, of, radiation, that, passes, through, or, is, emitted, radiant, barriers, are, materials, that, reflect, radiation, and, therefore, reduce, the, flow, of, heat, from, radiation, sources, good, insulators, are, not, necessarily, good, radiant, barriers, and, vice, versa, metal, for, instance, is, an, excellent, reflector, and, a, poor, insulator, the, effectiveness, of, a, radiant, barrier, is, indicated, by, its, reflectivity, which, is, the, fraction, of, radiation, reflected, a, material, with, a, high, reflectivity, at, a, given, wavelength, has, a, low, emissivity, at, that, same, wavelength, and, vice, versa, at, any, specific, wavelength, reflectivity, 1, emissivity, an, ideal, radiant, barrier, would, have, a, reflectivity, of, 1, and, would, therefore, reflect, 100, percent, of, incoming, radiation, vacuum, flasks, or, dewars, are, silvered, to, approach, this, ideal, in, the, vacuum, of, space, satellites, use, multi, layer, insulation,

planetary, surface, is, absorbed, by, atmospheric, greenhouse, gases, and, clouds, and, is, re, radiated, in, all, directions, resulting, in, a, reduction, in, the, amount, of, thermal, radiation, reaching, space, relative, to, what, would, reach, space, in, the, absence, of, absorbing, materials, this, reduction, in, outgoing, radiation, leads, to, a, rise, in, the, temperature, of, the, surface, and, troposphere, until, the, rate, of, outgoing, radiation, again, equals, the, rate, at, which, heat, arrives, from, the, sun, the, principles, of, heat, transfer, in, engineering, systems, can, be, applied, to, the, human, body, to, determine, how, the, body, transfers, heat, heat, is, produced, in, the, body, by, the, continuous, metabolism, of, nutrients, which, provides, energy, for, the, systems, of, the, body, the, human, body, must, maintain, a, consistent, internal, temperature, to, maintain, healthy, bodily, functions, therefore, excess, heat, must, be, dissipated, from, the, body, to, keep, it, from, overheating, when, a, person, engages, in, elevated, levels, of, physical, activity, the, body, requires, additional, fuel, which, increases, the, metabolic, rate, and, the, rate, of, heat, production, the, body, must, then, use, additional, methods, to, remove, the, additional, heat, produced, to, keep, the, internal, temperature, at, a, healthy, level, heat, transfer, by, convection, is, driven, by, the, movement, of, fluids, over, the, surface, of, the, body, this, convective, fluid, can, be, either, a, liquid, or, a, gas, for, heat, transfer, from, the, outer, surface, of, the, body, the, convection, mechanism, is, dependent, on, the, surface, area, of, the, body, the, velocity, of, the, air, and, the, temperature, gradient, between, the, surface, of, the, skin, and, the, ambient, air, the, normal, temperature, of, the, body, is, approximately, 37, c, heat, transfer, occurs, more, readily, when, the, temperature, of, the, surroundings, is, significantly, less, than, the, normal, body, temperature, this, concept, explains, why, a, person, feels, cold, when, not, enough, covering, is, worn, when, exposed, to, a, cold, environment, clothing, can, be, considered, an, insulator, which, provides, thermal, resistance, to, heat, flow, over, the, covered, portion, of, the, body, this, thermal, resistance, causes, the, temperature, on, the, surface, of, the, clothing, to, be, less, than, the, temperature, on, the, surface, of, the, skin, this, smaller, temperature, gradient, between, the, surface, temperature, and, the, ambient, temperature, will, cause, a, lower, rate, of, heat, transfer, than, if, the, skin, were, not, covered, to, ensure, that, one, portion, of, the, body, is, not, significantly, hotter, than, another, portion, heat, must, be, distributed, evenly, through, the, bodily, tissues, blood, flowing, through, blood, vessels, acts, as, a, convective, fluid, and, helps, to, prevent, any, buildup, of, excess, heat, inside, the, tissues, of, the, body, this, flow, of, blood, through, the, vessels, can, be, modeled, as, pipe, flow, in, an, engineering, system, the, heat, carried, by, the, blood, is, determined, by, the, temperature, of, the, surrounding, tissue, the, diameter, of, the, blood, vessel, the, thickness, of, the, fluid, the, velocity, of, the, flow, and, the, heat, transfer, coefficient, of, the, blood, the, velocity, blood, vessel, diameter, and, fluid, thickness, can, all, be, related, to, the, reynolds, number, a, dimensionless, number, used, in, fluid, mechanics, to, characterize, the, flow, of, fluids, latent, heat, loss, also, known, as, evaporative, heat, loss, accounts, for, a, large, fraction, of, heat, loss, from, the, body, when, the, core, temperature, of, the, body, increases, the, body, triggers, sweat, glands, in, the, skin, to, bring, additional, moisture, to, the, surface, of, the, skin, the, liquid, is, then, transformed, into, vapor, which, removes, heat, from, the, surface, of, the, body, the, rate, of, evaporation, heat, loss, is, directly, related, to, the, vapor, pressure, at, the, skin, surface, and, the, amount, of, moisture, present, on, the, skin, therefore, the, maximum, of, heat, transfer, will, occur, when, the, skin, is, completely, wet, the, body, continuously, loses, water, by, evaporation, but, the, most, significant, amount, of, heat, loss, occurs, during, periods, of, increased, physical, activity, evaporative, cooling, happens, when, water, vapor, is, added, to, the, surrounding, air, the, energy, needed, to, evaporate, the, water, is, taken, from, the, air, in, the, form, of, sensible, heat, and, converted, into, latent, heat, while, the, air, remains, at, a, constant, enthalpy, latent, heat, describes, the, amount, of, heat, that, is, needed, to, evaporate, the, liquid, this, heat, comes, from, the, liquid, itself, and, the, surrounding, gas, and, surfaces, the, greater, the, difference, between, the, two, temperatures, the, greater, the, evaporative, cooling, effect, when, the, temperatures, are, the, same, no, net, evaporation, of, water, in, the, air, occurs, thus, there, is, no, cooling, effect, in, quantum, physics, laser, cooling, is, used, to, achieve, temperatures, of, near, absolute, zero, 273, 15, c, 459, 67, f, of, atomic, and, molecular, samples, to, observe, unique, quantum, effects, that, can, only, occur, at, this, heat, level, magnetic, evaporative, cooling, is, a, process, for, lowering, the, temperature, of, a, group, of, atoms, after, pre, cooled, by, methods, such, as, laser, cooling, magnetic, refrigeration, cools, below, 0, 3k, by, making, use, of, the, magnetocaloric, effect, radiative, cooling, is, the, process, by, which, a, body, loses, heat, by, radiation, outgoing, energy, is, an, important, effect, in, the, earth, s, energy, budget, in, the, case, of, the, earth, atmosphere, system, it, refers, to, the, process, by, which, long, wave, infrared, radiation, is, emitted, to, balance, the, absorption, of, short, wave, visible, energy, from, the, sun, the, thermosphere, top, of, atmosphere, cools, to, space, primarily, by, infrared, energy, radiated, by, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, at, 15, m, and, by, nitric, oxide, no, at, 5, 3, m, convective, transport, of, heat, and, evaporative, transport, of, latent, heat, both, remove, heat, from, the, surface, and, redistribute, it, in, the, atmosphere, thermal, energy, storage, includes, technologies, for, collecting, and, storing, energy, for, later, use, it, may, be, employed, to, balance, energy, demand, between, day, and, nighttime, the, thermal, reservoir, may, be, maintained, at, a, temperature, above, or, below, that, of, the, ambient, environment, applications, include, space, heating, domestic, or, process, hot, water, systems, or, generating, electricity, in, 1701, isaac, newton, anonymously, published, an, article, in, philosophical, transactions, noting, in, modern, terms, that, the, rate, of, temperature, change, of, a, body, is, proportional, to, the, difference, in, temperatures, graduum, caloris, degrees, of, heat, between, the, body, and, its, surroundings, the, phrase, temperature, change, was, later, replaced, with, heat, loss, and, the, relationship, was, named, newton, s, law, of, cooling, in, general, the, law, is, valid, only, if, the, temperature, difference, is, small, and, the, heat, transfer, mechanism, remains, the, same, in, heat, conduction, the, law, is, valid, only, if, the, thermal, conductivity, of, the, warmer, body, is, independent, of, temperature, the, thermal, conductivity, of, most, materials, is, only, weakly, dependent, on, temperature, so, in, general, the, law, holds, true, in, convective, heat, transfer, the, law, is, valid, for, forced, air, or, pumped, fluid, cooling, where, the, properties, of, the, fluid, do, not, vary, strongly, with, temperature, but, it, is, only, approximately, true, for, buoyancy, driven, convection, where, the, velocity, of, the, flow, increases, with, temperature, difference, in, the, case, of, heat, transfer, by, thermal, radiation, newton, s, law, of, cooling, holds, only, for, very, small, temperature, differences, in, a, 1780, letter, to, benjamin, franklin, dutch, born, british, scientist, jan, ingenhousz, relates, an, experiment, which, enabled, him, to, rank, seven, different, metals, according, to, their, thermal, conductivities, you, remembre, you, gave, me, a, wire, of, five, metals, all, drawn, thro, the, same, hole, viz, one, of, gould, one, of, silver, copper, steel, and, iron, i, supplyed, here, the, two, others, viz, the, one, of, tin, the, other, of, lead, i, fixed, these, seven, wires, into, a, wooden, frame, at, an, equal, distance, of, one, an, other, i, dipt, the, seven, wires, into, this, melted, wax, as, deep, as, the, wooden, frame, by, taking, them, out, they, were, covred, with, a, coat, of, wax, when, i, found, that, this, crust, was, there, about, of, an, equal, thikness, upon, all, the, wires, i, placed, them, all, in, a, glased, earthen, vessel, full, of, olive, oil, heated, to, some, degrees, under, boiling, taking, care, that, each, wire, was, dipt, just, as, far, in, the, oil, as, the, other, now, as, they, had, been, all, dipt, alike, at, the, same, time, in, the, same, oil, it, must, follow, that, the, wire, upon, which, the, wax, had, been, melted, the, highest, had, been, the, best, conductor, of, heat, silver, conducted, heat, far, the, best, of, all, other, metals, next, to, this, was, copper, then, gold, tin, iron, steel, lead, during, the, years, 1784, 1798, the, british, physicist, benjamin, thompson, count, rumford, lived, in, bavaria, reorganizing, the, bavarian, army, for, the, prince, elector, charles, theodore, among, other, official, and, charitable, duties, the, elector, gave, thompson, access, to, the, facilities, of, the, electoral, academy, of, sciences, in, mannheim, during, his, years, in, mannheim, and, later, in, munich, thompson, made, a, large, number, of, discoveries, and, inventions, related, to, heat, in, 1785, thompson, performed, a, series, of, thermal, conductivity, experiments, which, he, describes, in, great, detail, in, the, philosophical, transactions, article, new, experiments, upon, heat, from, 1786, the, fact, that, good, electrical, conductors, are, often, also, good, heat, conductors, and, vice, versa, must, have, been, well, known, at, the, time, for, thompson, mentions, it, in, passing, he, intended, to, measure, the, relative, conductivities, of, mercury, water, moist, air, common, air, dry, air, at, normal, atmospheric, pressure, dry, air, of, various, rarefication, and, a, torricellian, vacuum, from, the, striking, analogy, between, the, electric, fluid, and, heat, respecting, their, conductors, and, non, conductors, having, found, that, bodies, in, general, which, are, conductors, of, the, electric, fluid, are, likewise, good, conductors, of, heat, and, on, the, contrary, that, electric, bodies, or, such, as, are, bad, conductors, of, the, electric, fluid, are, likewise, bad, conductors, of, heat, i, was, led, to, imagine, that, the, torricellian, vacuum, which, is, known, to, afford, so, ready, a, passage, to, the, electric, fluid, would, also, have, afforded, a, ready, passage, to, heat, for, these, experiments, thompson, employed, a, thermometer, inside, a, large, closed, glass, tube, under, the, circumstances, described, heat, may, unbeknownst, to, thompson, have, been, transferred, more, by, radiation, than, by, conduction, these, were, his, results, after, the, experiments, thompson, was, surprised, to, observe, that, a, vacuum, was, a, significantly, poorer, heat, conductor, than, air, which, of, itself, is, reckoned, among, the, worst, but, only, a, very, small, difference, between, common, air, and, rarefied, air, he, also, noted, the, great, difference, between, dry, air, and, moist, air, and, the, great, benefit, this, affords, i, cannot, help, observing, with, what, infinite, wisdom, and, goodness, divine, providence, appears, to, have, guarded, us, against, the, evil, effects, of, excessive, heat, and, cold, in, the, atmosphere, for, if, it, were, possible, for, the, air, to, be, equally, damp, during, the, severe, cold, of, the, winter, as, it, sometimes, is, in, summer, its, conducing, power, and, consequently, its, apparent, coldness, would, become, quite, intolerable, but, happily, for, us, its, power, to, hold, water, in, solution, is, diminished, and, with, it, its, power, to, rob, us, of, our, animal, heat, every, body, knows, how, very, disagreeable, a, very, moderate, degree, of, cold, is, when, the, air, is, very, damp, and, from, hence, it, appears, why, the, thermometer, is, not, always, a, just, measure, of, the, apparent, or, sensible, heat, of, the, atmosphere, if, colds, are, occasioned, by, our, bodies, being, robbed, of, our, animal, heat, the, reason, is, plain, why, those, disorders, prevail, most, during, the, cold, autumnal, rains, and, upon, the, breaking, up, of, the, frost, in, the, spring, it, is, likewise, plain, inhabiting, damp, houses, is, so, very, dangerous, and, why, the, evening, air, is, so, pernicious, in, summer, and, why, it, is, not, so, during, the, hard, frosts, of, winter, thompson, concluded, with, some, comments, on, the, important, difference, between, temperature, and, sensible, heat, the, sensation, of, hot, or, cold, depends, not, intirely, upon, the, temperature, of, the, body, exciting, in, us, those, sensations, but, upon, the, quantity, of, heat, it, is, capable, of, communicating, to, us, or, receiving, from, us, and, this, depends, in, a, great, measure, upon, the, conducing, powers, of, the, bodies, in, question, the, sensation, of, hot, is, the, entrance, of, heat, into, our, bodies, that, of, cold, is, its, exit, this, is, another, proof, that, the, thermometer, cannot, be, a, just, measure, of, sensible, heat, or, rather, that, the, touch, does, not, afford, us, a, just, indication, of, real, temperatures, in, the, 1830s, in, the, bridgewater, treatises, the, term, convection, is, attested, in, a, scientific, sense, in, treatise, viii, by, william, prout, in, the, book, on, chemistry, it, says, this, motion, of, heat, takes, place, in, three, ways, which, a, common, fire, place, very, well, illustrates, if, for, instance, we, place, a, thermometer, directly, before, a, fire, it, soon, begins, to, rise, indicating, an, increase, of, temperature, in, this, case, the, heat, has, made, its, way, through, the, space, between, the, fire, and, the, thermometer, by, the, process, termed, radiation, if, we, place, a, second, thermometer, in, contact, with, any, part, of, the, grate, and, away, from, the, direct, influence, of, the, fire, we, shall, find, that, this, thermometer, also, denotes, an, increase, of, temperature, but, here, the, heat, must, have, travelled, through, the, metal, of, the, grate, by, what, is, termed, conduction, lastly, a, third, thermometer, placed, in, the, chimney, away, from, the, direct, influence, of, the, fire, will, also, indicate, a, considerable, increase, of, temperature, in, this, case, a, portion, of, the, air, passing, through, and, near, the, fire, has, become, heated, and, has, carried, up, the, chimney, the, temperature, acquired, from, the, fire, there, is, at, present, no, single, term, in, our, language, employed, to, denote, this, third, mode, of, the, propagation, of, heat, but, we, venture, to, propose, for, that, purpose, the, term, convection, convectio, a, carrying, or, conveying, which, not, only, expresses, the, leading, fact, but, also, accords, very, well, with, the, two, other, terms, later, in, the, same, treatise, viii, in, the, book, on, meteorology, the, concept, of, convection, is, also, applied, to, the, process, by, which, heat, is, communicated, through, water
