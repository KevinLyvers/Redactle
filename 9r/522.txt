ethylene, iupac, name, ethene, is, a, hydrocarbon, which, has, the, formula, c, 2, h, 4, or, h, 2, c, ch, 2, it, is, a, colourless, flammable, gas, with, a, faint, sweet, and, musky, odour, when, pure, it, is, the, simplest, alkene, a, hydrocarbon, with, carbon, carbon, double, bonds, ethylene, is, widely, used, in, the, chemical, industry, and, its, worldwide, production, over, 150, million, tonnes, in, 2016, exceeds, that, of, any, other, organic, compound, much, of, this, production, goes, toward, creating, polythene, which, is, a, widely, used, plastic, containing, polymer, chains, of, ethylene, units, in, various, chain, lengths, production, emits, greenhouse, gases, including, methane, from, feedstock, production, and, carbon, dioxide, from, any, non, sustainable, energy, used, ethylene, is, also, an, important, natural, plant, hormone, and, is, used, in, agriculture, to, induce, ripening, of, fruits, the, hydrate, of, ethylene, is, ethanol, this, hydrocarbon, has, four, hydrogen, atoms, bound, to, a, pair, of, carbon, atoms, that, are, connected, by, a, double, bond, all, six, atoms, that, comprise, ethylene, are, coplanar, the, h, c, h, angle, is, 117, 4, close, to, the, 120, for, ideal, sp, hybridized, carbon, the, molecule, is, also, relatively, weak, rotation, about, the, c, c, bond, is, a, very, low, energy, process, that, requires, breaking, the, bond, by, supplying, heat, at, 50, c, the, bond, in, the, ethylene, molecule, is, responsible, for, its, useful, reactivity, the, double, bond, is, a, region, of, high, electron, density, thus, it, is, susceptible, to, attack, by, electrophiles, many, reactions, of, ethylene, are, catalyzed, by, transition, metals, which, bind, transiently, to, the, ethylene, using, both, the, and, orbitals, being, a, simple, molecule, ethylene, is, spectroscopically, simple, its, uv, vis, spectrum, is, still, used, as, a, test, of, theoretical, methods, major, industrial, reactions, of, ethylene, include, in, order, of, scale, 1, polymerization, 2, oxidation, 3, halogenation, and, hydrohalogenation, 4, alkylation, 5, hydration, 6, oligomerization, and, 7, hydroformylation, in, the, united, states, and, europe, approximately, 90, of, ethylene, is, used, to, produce, ethylene, oxide, ethylene, dichloride, ethylbenzene, and, polyethylene, most, of, the, reactions, with, ethylene, are, electrophilic, addition, polyethylene, production, uses, more, than, half, of, the, world, s, ethylene, supply, polyethylene, also, called, polyethene, and, polythene, is, the, world, s, most, widely, used, plastic, it, is, primarily, used, to, make, films, in, packaging, carrier, bags, and, trash, liners, linear, alpha, olefins, produced, by, oligomerization, formation, of, short, chain, molecules, are, used, as, precursors, detergents, plasticisers, synthetic, lubricants, additives, and, also, as, co, monomers, in, the, production, of, polyethylenes, ethylene, is, oxidized, to, produce, ethylene, oxide, a, key, raw, material, in, the, production, of, surfactants, and, detergents, by, ethoxylation, ethylene, oxide, is, also, hydrolyzed, to, produce, ethylene, glycol, widely, used, as, an, automotive, antifreeze, as, well, as, higher, molecular, weight, glycols, glycol, ethers, and, polyethylene, terephthalate, ethylene, oxidation, in, the, presence, of, a, palladium, catalyst, can, form, acetaldehyde, this, conversion, remains, a, major, industrial, process, 10m, kg, y, the, process, proceeds, via, the, initial, complexation, of, ethylene, to, a, pd, ii, center, major, intermediates, from, the, halogenation, and, hydrohalogenation, of, ethylene, include, ethylene, dichloride, ethyl, chloride, and, ethylene, dibromide, the, addition, of, chlorine, entails, oxychlorination, i, e, chlorine, itself, is, not, used, some, products, derived, from, this, group, are, polyvinyl, chloride, trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, methyl, chloroform, polyvinylidene, chloride, and, copolymers, and, ethyl, bromide, major, chemical, intermediates, from, the, alkylation, with, ethylene, is, ethylbenzene, precursor, to, styrene, styrene, is, used, principally, in, polystyrene, for, packaging, and, insulation, as, well, as, in, styrene, butadiene, rubber, for, tires, and, footwear, on, a, smaller, scale, ethyltoluene, ethylanilines, 1, 4, hexadiene, and, aluminium, alkyls, products, of, these, intermediates, include, polystyrene, unsaturated, polyesters, and, ethylene, propylene, terpolymers, the, hydroformylation, oxo, reaction, of, ethylene, results, in, propionaldehyde, a, precursor, to, propionic, acid, and, n, propyl, alcohol, ethylene, has, long, represented, the, major, nonfermentative, precursor, to, ethanol, the, original, method, entailed, its, conversion, to, diethyl, sulfate, followed, by, hydrolysis, the, main, method, practiced, since, the, mid, 1990s, is, the, direct, hydration, of, ethylene, catalyzed, by, solid, acid, catalysts, ethylene, is, dimerized, by, hydrovinylation, to, give, n, butenes, using, processes, licensed, by, lummus, or, ifp, the, lummus, process, produces, mixed, n, butenes, primarily, 2, butenes, while, the, ifp, process, produces, 1, butene, 1, butene, is, used, as, a, comonomer, in, the, production, of, certain, kinds, of, polyethylene, ethylene, is, a, hormone, that, affects, the, ripening, and, flowering, of, many, plants, it, is, widely, used, to, control, freshness, in, horticulture, and, fruits, the, scrubbing, of, naturally, occurring, ethylene, delays, ripening, adsorption, of, ethylene, by, nets, coated, in, titanium, dioxide, gel, has, also, been, shown, to, be, effective, an, example, of, a, niche, use, is, as, an, anesthetic, agent, in, an, 85, ethylene, 15, oxygen, ratio, another, use, is, as, a, welding, gas, it, is, also, used, as, a, refrigerant, gas, for, low, temperature, applications, under, the, name, r, 1150, global, ethylene, production, was, 107, million, tonnes, in, 2005, 109, million, tonnes, in, 2006, 138, million, tonnes, in, 2010, and, 141, million, tonnes, in, 2011, by, 2013, ethylene, was, produced, by, at, least, 117, companies, in, 32, countries, to, meet, the, ever, increasing, demand, for, ethylene, sharp, increases, in, production, facilities, are, added, globally, particularly, in, the, mideast, and, in, china, production, emits, greenhouse, gas, namely, significant, amounts, of, carbon, dioxide, ethylene, is, produced, by, several, methods, in, the, petrochemical, industry, a, primary, method, is, steam, cracking, sc, where, hydrocarbons, and, steam, are, heated, to, 750, 950, c, this, process, converts, large, hydrocarbons, into, smaller, ones, and, introduces, unsaturation, when, ethane, is, the, feedstock, ethylene, is, the, product, ethylene, is, separated, from, the, resulting, mixture, by, repeated, compression, and, distillation, in, europe, and, asia, ethylene, is, obtained, mainly, from, cracking, naphtha, gasoil, and, condensates, with, the, coproduction, of, propylene, c4, olefins, and, aromatics, pyrolysis, gasoline, other, technologies, employed, for, the, production, of, ethylene, include, fischer, tropsch, synthesis, and, methanol, to, olefins, mto, although, of, great, value, industrially, ethylene, is, rarely, synthesized, in, the, laboratory, and, is, ordinarily, purchased, it, can, be, produced, via, dehydration, of, ethanol, with, sulfuric, acid, or, in, the, gas, phase, with, aluminium, oxide, or, activated, alumina, ethylene, is, produced, from, methionine, in, nature, the, immediate, precursor, is, 1, aminocyclopropane, 1, carboxylic, acid, ethylene, is, a, fundamental, ligand, in, transition, metal, alkene, complexes, one, of, the, first, organometallic, compounds, zeise, s, salt, is, a, complex, of, ethylene, useful, reagents, containing, ethylene, include, pt, pph, 3, 2, c, 2, h, 4, and, rh, 2, cl, 2, c, 2, h, 4, 4, the, rh, catalysed, hydroformylation, of, ethylene, is, conducted, on, an, industrial, scale, to, provide, propionaldehyde, some, geologists, and, scholars, believe, that, the, famous, greek, oracle, at, delphi, the, pythia, went, into, her, trance, like, state, as, an, effect, of, ethylene, rising, from, ground, faults, ethylene, appears, to, have, been, discovered, by, johann, joachim, becher, who, obtained, it, by, heating, ethanol, with, sulfuric, acid, he, mentioned, the, gas, in, his, physica, subterranea, 1669, joseph, priestley, also, mentions, the, gas, in, his, experiments, and, observations, relating, to, the, various, branches, of, natural, philosophy, with, a, continuation, of, the, observations, on, air, 1779, where, he, reports, that, jan, ingenhousz, saw, ethylene, synthesized, in, the, same, way, by, a, mr, en, e, in, amsterdam, in, 1777, and, that, ingenhousz, subsequently, produced, the, gas, himself, the, properties, of, ethylene, were, studied, in, 1795, by, four, dutch, chemists, johann, rudolph, deimann, adrien, paets, van, troostwyck, anthoni, lauwerenburgh, and, nicolas, bondt, who, found, that, it, differed, from, hydrogen, gas, and, that, it, contained, both, carbon, and, hydrogen, this, group, also, discovered, that, ethylene, could, be, combined, with, chlorine, to, produce, the, dutch, oil, 1, 2, dichloroethane, this, discovery, gave, ethylene, the, name, used, for, it, at, that, time, olefiant, gas, oil, making, gas, the, term, olefiant, gas, is, in, turn, the, etymological, origin, of, the, modern, word, olefin, the, class, of, hydrocarbons, in, which, ethylene, is, the, first, member, in, the, mid, 19th, century, the, suffix, ene, an, ancient, greek, root, added, to, the, end, of, female, names, meaning, daughter, of, was, widely, used, to, refer, to, a, molecule, or, part, thereof, that, contained, one, fewer, hydrogen, atoms, than, the, molecule, being, modified, thus, ethylene, c, 2, h, 4, was, the, daughter, of, ethyl, c, 2, h, 5, the, name, ethylene, was, used, in, this, sense, as, early, as, 1852, in, 1866, the, german, chemist, august, wilhelm, von, hofmann, proposed, a, system, of, hydrocarbon, nomenclature, in, which, the, suffixes, ane, ene, ine, one, and, une, were, used, to, denote, the, hydrocarbons, with, 0, 2, 4, 6, and, 8, fewer, hydrogens, than, their, parent, alkane, in, this, system, ethylene, became, ethene, hofmann, s, system, eventually, became, the, basis, for, the, geneva, nomenclature, approved, by, the, international, congress, of, chemists, in, 1892, which, remains, at, the, core, of, the, iupac, nomenclature, however, by, that, time, the, name, ethylene, was, deeply, entrenched, and, it, remains, in, wide, use, today, especially, in, the, chemical, industry, following, experimentation, by, luckhardt, crocker, and, carter, at, the, university, of, chicago, ethylene, was, used, as, an, anesthetic, it, remained, in, use, through, the, 1940s, use, even, while, chloroform, was, being, phased, out, its, pungent, odor, and, its, explosive, nature, limit, its, use, today, the, 1979, iupac, nomenclature, rules, made, an, exception, for, retaining, the, non, systematic, name, ethylene, however, this, decision, was, reversed, in, the, 1993, rules, and, it, remains, unchanged, in, the, newest, 2013, recommendations, so, the, iupac, name, is, now, ethene, in, the, iupac, system, the, name, ethylene, is, reserved, for, the, divalent, group, ch, 2, ch, 2, hence, names, like, ethylene, oxide, and, ethylene, dibromide, are, permitted, but, the, use, of, the, name, ethylene, for, the, two, carbon, alkene, is, not, nevertheless, use, of, the, name, ethylene, for, h, 2, c, ch, 2, and, propylene, for, h, 2, c, chch, 3, is, still, prevalent, among, chemists, in, north, america, a, key, factor, affecting, petrochemicals, life, cycle, emissions, is, the, methane, intensity, of, feedstocks, especially, in, the, production, segment, emissions, from, cracking, of, naptha, and, natural, gas, common, in, the, us, as, gas, is, cheap, there, depend, a, lot, on, the, source, of, energy, for, example, gas, burnt, to, provide, high, temperatures, but, that, from, naptha, is, certainly, more, per, kg, of, feedstock, both, steam, cracking, and, production, from, natural, gas, via, ethane, are, estimated, to, emit, 1, 8, to, 2kg, of, co2, per, kg, ethylene, produced, totalling, over, 260, million, tonnes, a, year, this, is, more, than, all, other, manufactured, chemicals, except, cement, and, ammonia, according, to, a, 2022, report, using, renewable, or, nuclear, energy, could, cut, emissions, by, almost, half, like, all, hydrocarbons, ethylene, is, a, combustible, asphyxiant, it, is, listed, as, an, iarc, group, 3, agent, since, there, is, no, current, evidence, that, it, causes, cancer, in, humans
