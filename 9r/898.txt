magnetism, is, the, class, of, physical, attributes, that, occur, through, a, magnetic, field, which, allows, objects, to, attract, or, repel, each, other, because, both, electric, currents, and, magnetic, moments, of, elementary, particles, give, rise, to, a, magnetic, field, magnetism, is, one, of, two, aspects, of, electromagnetism, the, most, familiar, effects, occur, in, ferromagnetic, materials, which, are, strongly, attracted, by, magnetic, fields, and, can, be, magnetized, to, become, permanent, magnets, producing, magnetic, fields, themselves, demagnetizing, a, magnet, is, also, possible, only, a, few, substances, are, ferromagnetic, the, most, common, ones, are, iron, cobalt, nickel, and, their, alloys, all, substances, exhibit, some, type, of, magnetism, magnetic, materials, are, classified, according, to, their, bulk, susceptibility, ferromagnetism, is, responsible, for, most, of, the, effects, of, magnetism, encountered, in, everyday, life, but, there, are, actually, several, types, of, magnetism, paramagnetic, substances, such, as, aluminium, and, oxygen, are, weakly, attracted, to, an, applied, magnetic, field, diamagnetic, substances, such, as, copper, and, carbon, are, weakly, repelled, while, antiferromagnetic, materials, such, as, chromium, have, a, more, complex, relationship, with, a, magnetic, field, the, force, of, a, magnet, on, paramagnetic, diamagnetic, and, antiferromagnetic, materials, is, usually, too, weak, to, be, felt, and, can, be, detected, only, by, laboratory, instruments, so, in, everyday, life, these, substances, are, often, described, as, non, magnetic, the, strength, of, a, magnetic, field, always, decreases, with, distance, from, the, magnetic, source, though, the, exact, mathematical, relationship, between, strength, and, distance, varies, many, factors, can, influence, the, magnetic, field, of, an, object, including, the, magnetic, moment, of, the, material, the, physical, shape, of, the, object, both, the, magnitude, and, direction, of, any, electric, current, present, within, the, object, and, the, temperature, of, the, object, magnetism, was, first, discovered, in, the, ancient, world, when, people, noticed, that, lodestones, naturally, magnetized, pieces, of, the, mineral, magnetite, could, attract, iron, the, word, magnet, comes, from, the, greek, term, magn, tis, lithos, the, magnesian, stone, lodestone, in, ancient, greece, aristotle, attributed, the, first, of, what, could, be, called, a, scientific, discussion, of, magnetism, to, the, philosopher, thales, of, miletus, who, lived, from, about, 625, bc, to, about, 545, bc, the, ancient, indian, medical, text, sushruta, samhita, describes, using, magnetite, to, remove, arrows, embedded, in, a, person, s, body, in, ancient, china, the, earliest, literary, reference, to, magnetism, lies, in, a, 4th, century, bc, book, named, after, its, author, guiguzi, the, 2nd, century, bc, annals, l, shi, chunqiu, also, notes, the, lodestone, makes, iron, approach, some, force, is, attracting, it, the, earliest, mention, of, the, attraction, of, a, needle, is, in, a, 1st, century, work, lunheng, balanced, inquiries, a, lodestone, attracts, a, needle, the, 11th, century, chinese, scientist, shen, kuo, was, the, first, person, to, write, in, the, dream, pool, essays, of, the, magnetic, needle, compass, and, that, it, improved, the, accuracy, of, navigation, by, employing, the, astronomical, concept, of, true, north, by, the, 12th, century, the, chinese, were, known, to, use, the, lodestone, compass, for, navigation, they, sculpted, a, directional, spoon, from, lodestone, in, such, a, way, that, the, handle, of, the, spoon, always, pointed, south, alexander, neckam, by, 1187, was, the, first, in, europe, to, describe, the, compass, and, its, use, for, navigation, in, 1269, peter, peregrinus, de, maricourt, wrote, the, epistola, de, magnete, the, first, extant, treatise, describing, the, properties, of, magnets, in, 1282, the, properties, of, magnets, and, the, dry, compasses, were, discussed, by, al, ashraf, umar, ii, a, yemeni, physicist, astronomer, and, geographer, leonardo, garzoni, s, only, extant, work, the, due, trattati, sopra, la, natura, e, le, qualit, della, calamita, two, treatises, on, the, nature, and, qualities, of, the, magnet, is, the, first, known, example, of, a, modern, treatment, of, magnetic, phenomena, written, in, years, near, 1580, and, never, published, the, treatise, had, a, wide, diffusion, in, particular, garzoni, is, referred, to, as, an, expert, in, magnetism, by, niccol, cabeo, whose, philosophia, magnetica, 1629, is, just, a, re, adjustment, of, garzoni, s, work, garzoni, s, treatise, was, known, also, to, giovanni, battista, della, porta, in, 1600, william, gilbert, published, his, de, magnete, magneticisque, corporibus, et, de, magno, magnete, tellure, on, the, magnet, and, magnetic, bodies, and, on, the, great, magnet, the, earth, in, this, work, he, describes, many, of, his, experiments, with, his, model, earth, called, the, terrella, from, his, experiments, he, concluded, that, the, earth, was, itself, magnetic, and, that, this, was, the, reason, compasses, pointed, north, whereas, previously, some, believed, that, it, was, the, pole, star, polaris, or, a, large, magnetic, island, on, the, north, pole, that, attracted, the, compass, an, understanding, of, the, relationship, between, electricity, and, magnetism, began, in, 1819, with, work, by, hans, christian, rsted, a, professor, at, the, university, of, copenhagen, who, discovered, by, the, accidental, twitching, of, a, compass, needle, near, a, wire, that, an, electric, current, could, create, a, magnetic, field, this, landmark, experiment, is, known, as, rsted, s, experiment, jean, baptiste, biot, and, f, lix, savart, both, of, whom, in, 1820, came, up, with, the, biot, savart, law, giving, an, equation, for, the, magnetic, field, from, a, current, carrying, wire, around, the, same, time, andr, marie, amp, re, carried, out, numerous, systematic, experiments, and, discovered, that, the, magnetic, force, between, two, dc, current, loops, of, any, shape, is, equal, to, the, sum, of, the, individual, forces, that, each, current, element, of, one, circuit, exerts, on, each, other, current, element, of, the, other, circuit, in, 1831, michael, faraday, discovered, that, a, time, varying, magnetic, flux, induces, a, voltage, through, a, wire, loop, in, 1835, carl, friedrich, gauss, hypothesized, based, on, amp, re, s, force, law, in, its, original, form, that, all, forms, of, magnetism, arise, as, a, result, of, elementary, point, charges, moving, relative, to, each, other, wilhelm, eduard, weber, advanced, gauss, s, theory, to, weber, electrodynamics, from, around, 1861, james, clerk, maxwell, synthesized, and, expanded, many, of, these, insights, into, maxwell, s, equations, unifying, electricity, magnetism, and, optics, into, the, field, of, electromagnetism, however, gauss, s, interpretation, of, magnetism, is, not, fully, compatible, with, maxwell, s, electrodynamics, in, 1905, albert, einstein, used, maxwell, s, equations, in, motivating, his, theory, of, special, relativity, requiring, that, the, laws, held, true, in, all, inertial, reference, frames, gauss, s, approach, of, interpreting, the, magnetic, force, as, a, mere, effect, of, relative, velocities, thus, found, its, way, back, into, electrodynamics, to, some, extent, electromagnetism, has, continued, to, develop, into, the, 21st, century, being, incorporated, into, the, more, fundamental, theories, of, gauge, theory, quantum, electrodynamics, electroweak, theory, and, finally, the, standard, model, magnetism, at, its, root, arises, from, three, sources, the, magnetic, properties, of, materials, are, mainly, due, to, the, magnetic, moments, of, their, atoms, orbiting, electrons, the, magnetic, moments, of, the, nuclei, of, atoms, are, typically, thousands, of, times, smaller, than, the, electrons, magnetic, moments, so, they, are, negligible, in, the, context, of, the, magnetization, of, materials, nuclear, magnetic, moments, are, nevertheless, very, important, in, other, contexts, particularly, in, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, nmr, and, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, ordinarily, the, enormous, number, of, electrons, in, a, material, are, arranged, such, that, their, magnetic, moments, both, orbital, and, intrinsic, cancel, out, this, is, due, to, some, extent, to, electrons, combining, into, pairs, with, opposite, intrinsic, magnetic, moments, as, a, result, of, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, see, electron, configuration, and, combining, into, filled, subshells, with, zero, net, orbital, motion, in, both, cases, the, electrons, preferentially, adopt, arrangements, in, which, the, magnetic, moment, of, each, electron, is, canceled, by, the, opposite, moment, of, another, electron, moreover, even, when, the, electron, configuration, is, such, that, there, are, unpaired, electrons, and, or, non, filled, subshells, it, is, often, the, case, that, the, various, electrons, in, the, solid, will, contribute, magnetic, moments, that, point, in, different, random, directions, so, that, the, material, will, not, be, magnetic, sometimes, either, spontaneously, or, owing, to, an, applied, external, magnetic, field, each, of, the, electron, magnetic, moments, will, be, on, average, lined, up, a, suitable, material, can, then, produce, a, strong, net, magnetic, field, the, magnetic, behavior, of, a, material, depends, on, its, structure, particularly, its, electron, configuration, for, the, reasons, mentioned, above, and, also, on, the, temperature, at, high, temperatures, random, thermal, motion, makes, it, more, difficult, for, the, electrons, to, maintain, alignment, diamagnetism, appears, in, all, materials, and, is, the, tendency, of, a, material, to, oppose, an, applied, magnetic, field, and, therefore, to, be, repelled, by, a, magnetic, field, however, in, a, material, with, paramagnetic, properties, that, is, with, a, tendency, to, enhance, an, external, magnetic, field, the, paramagnetic, behavior, dominates, thus, despite, its, universal, occurrence, diamagnetic, behavior, is, observed, only, in, a, purely, diamagnetic, material, in, a, diamagnetic, material, there, are, no, unpaired, electrons, so, the, intrinsic, electron, magnetic, moments, cannot, produce, any, bulk, effect, in, these, cases, the, magnetization, arises, from, the, electrons, orbital, motions, which, can, be, understood, classically, as, follows, when, a, material, is, put, in, a, magnetic, field, the, electrons, circling, the, nucleus, will, experience, in, addition, to, their, coulomb, attraction, to, the, nucleus, a, lorentz, force, from, the, magnetic, field, depending, on, which, direction, the, electron, is, orbiting, this, force, may, increase, the, centripetal, force, on, the, electrons, pulling, them, in, towards, the, nucleus, or, it, may, decrease, the, force, pulling, them, away, from, the, nucleus, this, effect, systematically, increases, the, orbital, magnetic, moments, that, were, aligned, opposite, the, field, and, decreases, the, ones, aligned, parallel, to, the, field, in, accordance, with, lenz, s, law, this, results, in, a, small, bulk, magnetic, moment, with, an, opposite, direction, to, the, applied, field, this, description, is, meant, only, as, a, heuristic, the, bohr, van, leeuwen, theorem, shows, that, diamagnetism, is, impossible, according, to, classical, physics, and, that, a, proper, understanding, requires, a, quantum, mechanical, description, all, materials, undergo, this, orbital, response, however, in, paramagnetic, and, ferromagnetic, substances, the, diamagnetic, effect, is, overwhelmed, by, the, much, stronger, effects, caused, by, the, unpaired, electrons, in, a, paramagnetic, material, there, are, unpaired, electrons, i, e, atomic, or, molecular, orbitals, with, exactly, one, electron, in, them, while, paired, electrons, are, required, by, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, to, have, their, intrinsic, spin, magnetic, moments, pointing, in, opposite, directions, causing, their, magnetic, fields, to, cancel, out, an, unpaired, electron, is, free, to, align, its, magnetic, moment, in, any, direction, when, an, external, magnetic, field, is, applied, these, magnetic, moments, will, tend, to, align, themselves, in, the, same, direction, as, the, applied, field, thus, reinforcing, it, a, ferromagnet, like, a, paramagnetic, substance, has, unpaired, electrons, however, in, addition, to, the, electrons, intrinsic, magnetic, moment, s, tendency, to, be, parallel, to, an, applied, field, there, is, also, in, these, materials, a, tendency, for, these, magnetic, moments, to, orient, parallel, to, each, other, to, maintain, a, lowered, energy, state, thus, even, in, the, absence, of, an, applied, field, the, magnetic, moments, of, the, electrons, in, the, material, spontaneously, line, up, parallel, to, one, another, every, ferromagnetic, substance, has, its, own, individual, temperature, called, the, curie, temperature, or, curie, point, above, which, it, loses, its, ferromagnetic, properties, this, is, because, the, thermal, tendency, to, disorder, overwhelms, the, energy, lowering, due, to, ferromagnetic, order, ferromagnetism, only, occurs, in, a, few, substances, common, ones, are, iron, nickel, cobalt, their, alloys, and, some, alloys, of, rare, earth, metals, the, magnetic, moments, of, atoms, in, a, ferromagnetic, material, cause, them, to, behave, something, like, tiny, permanent, magnets, they, stick, together, and, align, themselves, into, small, regions, of, more, or, less, uniform, alignment, called, magnetic, domains, or, weiss, domains, magnetic, domains, can, be, observed, with, a, magnetic, force, microscope, to, reveal, magnetic, domain, boundaries, that, resemble, white, lines, in, the, sketch, there, are, many, scientific, experiments, that, can, physically, show, magnetic, fields, when, a, domain, contains, too, many, molecules, it, becomes, unstable, and, divides, into, two, domains, aligned, in, opposite, directions, so, that, they, stick, together, more, stably, when, exposed, to, a, magnetic, field, the, domain, boundaries, move, so, that, the, domains, aligned, with, the, magnetic, field, grow, and, dominate, the, structure, dotted, yellow, area, as, shown, at, the, left, when, the, magnetizing, field, is, removed, the, domains, may, not, return, to, an, unmagnetized, state, this, results, in, the, ferromagnetic, material, s, being, magnetized, forming, a, permanent, magnet, when, magnetized, strongly, enough, that, the, prevailing, domain, overruns, all, others, to, result, in, only, one, single, domain, the, material, is, magnetically, saturated, when, a, magnetized, ferromagnetic, material, is, heated, to, the, curie, point, temperature, the, molecules, are, agitated, to, the, point, that, the, magnetic, domains, lose, the, organization, and, the, magnetic, properties, they, cause, cease, when, the, material, is, cooled, this, domain, alignment, structure, spontaneously, returns, in, a, manner, roughly, analogous, to, how, a, liquid, can, freeze, into, a, crystalline, solid, in, an, antiferromagnet, unlike, a, ferromagnet, there, is, a, tendency, for, the, intrinsic, magnetic, moments, of, neighboring, valence, electrons, to, point, in, opposite, directions, when, all, atoms, are, arranged, in, a, substance, so, that, each, neighbor, is, anti, parallel, the, substance, is, antiferromagnetic, antiferromagnets, have, a, zero, net, magnetic, moment, because, adjacent, opposite, moment, cancels, out, meaning, that, no, field, is, produced, by, them, antiferromagnets, are, less, common, compared, to, the, other, types, of, behaviors, and, are, mostly, observed, at, low, temperatures, in, varying, temperatures, antiferromagnets, can, be, seen, to, exhibit, diamagnetic, and, ferromagnetic, properties, in, some, materials, neighboring, electrons, prefer, to, point, in, opposite, directions, but, there, is, no, geometrical, arrangement, in, which, each, pair, of, neighbors, is, anti, aligned, this, is, called, a, canted, antiferromagnet, or, spin, ice, and, is, an, example, of, geometrical, frustration, like, ferromagnetism, ferrimagnets, retain, their, magnetization, in, the, absence, of, a, field, however, like, antiferromagnets, neighboring, pairs, of, electron, spins, tend, to, point, in, opposite, directions, these, two, properties, are, not, contradictory, because, in, the, optimal, geometrical, arrangement, there, is, more, magnetic, moment, from, the, sublattice, of, electrons, that, point, in, one, direction, than, from, the, sublattice, that, points, in, the, opposite, direction, most, ferrites, are, ferrimagnetic, the, first, discovered, magnetic, substance, magnetite, is, a, ferrite, and, was, originally, believed, to, be, a, ferromagnet, louis, n, el, disproved, this, however, after, discovering, ferrimagnetism, when, a, ferromagnet, or, ferrimagnet, is, sufficiently, small, it, acts, like, a, single, magnetic, spin, that, is, subject, to, brownian, motion, its, response, to, a, magnetic, field, is, qualitatively, similar, to, the, response, of, a, paramagnet, but, much, larger, japanese, physicist, yosuke, nagaoka, conceived, of, a, type, of, magnetism, in, a, square, two, dimensional, lattice, where, every, lattice, node, had, one, electron, if, one, electron, was, removed, under, specific, conditions, the, lattice, s, energy, would, be, minimal, only, when, all, electrons, spins, were, parallel, a, variation, on, this, was, achieved, experimentally, by, arranging, the, atoms, in, a, triangular, moir, lattice, of, molybdenum, diselenide, and, tungsten, disulfide, monolayers, applying, a, weak, magnetic, field, and, a, voltage, led, to, ferromagnetic, behavior, when, 100, 150, more, electrons, than, lattice, nodes, were, present, the, extra, electrons, delocalized, and, paired, with, lattice, electrons, to, form, doublons, delocalization, was, prevented, unless, the, lattice, electrons, had, aligned, spins, the, doublons, thus, created, localized, ferromagnetic, regions, the, phenomenon, took, place, at, 140, millikelvins, an, electromagnet, is, a, type, of, magnet, in, which, the, magnetic, field, is, produced, by, an, electric, current, the, magnetic, field, disappears, when, the, current, is, turned, off, electromagnets, usually, consist, of, a, large, number, of, closely, spaced, turns, of, wire, that, create, the, magnetic, field, the, wire, turns, are, often, wound, around, a, magnetic, core, made, from, a, ferromagnetic, or, ferrimagnetic, material, such, as, iron, the, magnetic, core, concentrates, the, magnetic, flux, and, makes, a, more, powerful, magnet, the, main, advantage, of, an, electromagnet, over, a, permanent, magnet, is, that, the, magnetic, field, can, be, quickly, changed, by, controlling, the, amount, of, electric, current, in, the, winding, however, unlike, a, permanent, magnet, that, needs, no, power, an, electromagnet, requires, a, continuous, supply, of, current, to, maintain, the, magnetic, field, electromagnets, are, widely, used, as, components, of, other, electrical, devices, such, as, motors, generators, relays, solenoids, loudspeakers, hard, disks, mri, machines, scientific, instruments, and, magnetic, separation, equipment, electromagnets, are, also, employed, in, industry, for, picking, up, and, moving, heavy, iron, objects, such, as, scrap, iron, and, steel, electromagnetism, was, discovered, in, 1820, as, a, consequence, of, einstein, s, theory, of, special, relativity, electricity, and, magnetism, are, fundamentally, interlinked, both, magnetism, lacking, electricity, and, electricity, without, magnetism, are, inconsistent, with, special, relativity, due, to, such, effects, as, length, contraction, time, dilation, and, the, fact, that, the, magnetic, force, is, velocity, dependent, however, when, both, electricity, and, magnetism, are, taken, into, account, the, resulting, theory, electromagnetism, is, fully, consistent, with, special, relativity, in, particular, a, phenomenon, that, appears, purely, electric, or, purely, magnetic, to, one, observer, may, be, a, mix, of, both, to, another, or, more, generally, the, relative, contributions, of, electricity, and, magnetism, are, dependent, on, the, frame, of, reference, thus, special, relativity, mixes, electricity, and, magnetism, into, a, single, inseparable, phenomenon, called, electromagnetism, analogous, to, how, general, relativity, mixes, space, and, time, into, spacetime, all, observations, on, electromagnetism, apply, to, what, might, be, considered, to, be, primarily, magnetism, e, g, perturbations, in, the, magnetic, field, are, necessarily, accompanied, by, a, nonzero, electric, field, and, propagate, at, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, where, 0, is, the, vacuum, permeability, in, a, material, the, quantity, 0, m, is, called, magnetic, polarization, if, the, field, h, is, small, the, response, of, the, magnetization, m, in, a, diamagnet, or, paramagnet, is, approximately, linear, the, constant, of, proportionality, being, called, the, magnetic, susceptibility, if, so, in, a, hard, magnet, such, as, a, ferromagnet, m, is, not, proportional, to, the, field, and, is, generally, nonzero, even, when, h, is, zero, see, remanence, the, phenomenon, of, magnetism, is, mediated, by, the, magnetic, field, an, electric, current, or, magnetic, dipole, creates, a, magnetic, field, and, that, field, in, turn, imparts, magnetic, forces, on, other, particles, that, are, in, the, fields, maxwell, s, equations, which, simplify, to, the, biot, savart, law, in, the, case, of, steady, currents, describe, the, origin, and, behavior, of, the, fields, that, govern, these, forces, therefore, magnetism, is, seen, whenever, electrically, charged, particles, are, in, motion, for, example, from, movement, of, electrons, in, an, electric, current, or, in, certain, cases, from, the, orbital, motion, of, electrons, around, an, atom, s, nucleus, they, also, arise, from, intrinsic, magnetic, dipoles, arising, from, quantum, mechanical, spin, the, same, situations, that, create, magnetic, fields, charge, moving, in, a, current, or, in, an, atom, and, intrinsic, magnetic, dipoles, are, also, the, situations, in, which, a, magnetic, field, has, an, effect, creating, a, force, following, is, the, formula, for, moving, charge, for, the, forces, on, an, intrinsic, dipole, see, magnetic, dipole, when, a, charged, particle, moves, through, a, magnetic, field, b, it, feels, a, lorentz, force, f, given, by, the, cross, product, where, because, this, is, a, cross, product, the, force, is, perpendicular, to, both, the, motion, of, the, particle, and, the, magnetic, field, it, follows, that, the, magnetic, force, does, no, work, on, the, particle, it, may, change, the, direction, of, the, particle, s, movement, but, it, cannot, cause, it, to, speed, up, or, slow, down, the, magnitude, of, the, force, is, where, displaystyle, theta, is, the, angle, between, v, and, b, one, tool, for, determining, the, direction, of, the, velocity, vector, of, a, moving, charge, the, magnetic, field, and, the, force, exerted, is, labeling, the, index, finger, v, the, middle, finger, b, and, the, thumb, f, with, your, right, hand, when, making, a, gun, like, configuration, with, the, middle, finger, crossing, under, the, index, finger, the, fingers, represent, the, velocity, vector, magnetic, field, vector, and, force, vector, respectively, see, also, right, hand, rule, a, very, common, source, of, magnetic, field, found, in, nature, is, a, dipole, with, a, south, pole, and, a, north, pole, terms, dating, back, to, the, use, of, magnets, as, compasses, interacting, with, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, to, indicate, north, and, south, on, the, globe, since, opposite, ends, of, magnets, are, attracted, the, north, pole, of, a, magnet, is, attracted, to, the, south, pole, of, another, magnet, the, earth, s, north, magnetic, pole, currently, in, the, arctic, ocean, north, of, canada, is, physically, a, south, pole, as, it, attracts, the, north, pole, of, a, compass, a, magnetic, field, contains, energy, and, physical, systems, move, toward, configurations, with, lower, energy, when, diamagnetic, material, is, placed, in, a, magnetic, field, a, magnetic, dipole, tends, to, align, itself, in, opposed, polarity, to, that, field, thereby, lowering, the, net, field, strength, when, ferromagnetic, material, is, placed, within, a, magnetic, field, the, magnetic, dipoles, align, to, the, applied, field, thus, expanding, the, domain, walls, of, the, magnetic, domains, since, a, bar, magnet, gets, its, ferromagnetism, from, electrons, distributed, evenly, throughout, the, bar, when, a, bar, magnet, is, cut, in, half, each, of, the, resulting, pieces, is, a, smaller, bar, magnet, even, though, a, magnet, is, said, to, have, a, north, pole, and, a, south, pole, these, two, poles, cannot, be, separated, from, each, other, a, monopole, if, such, a, thing, exists, would, be, a, new, and, fundamentally, different, kind, of, magnetic, object, it, would, act, as, an, isolated, north, pole, not, attached, to, a, south, pole, or, vice, versa, monopoles, would, carry, magnetic, charge, analogous, to, electric, charge, despite, systematic, searches, since, 1931, as, of, 2010, they, have, never, been, observed, and, could, very, well, not, exist, nevertheless, some, theoretical, physics, models, predict, the, existence, of, these, magnetic, monopoles, paul, dirac, observed, in, 1931, that, because, electricity, and, magnetism, show, a, certain, symmetry, just, as, quantum, theory, predicts, that, individual, positive, or, negative, electric, charges, can, be, observed, without, the, opposing, charge, isolated, south, or, north, magnetic, poles, should, be, observable, using, quantum, theory, dirac, showed, that, if, magnetic, monopoles, exist, then, one, could, explain, the, quantization, of, electric, charge, that, is, why, the, observed, elementary, particles, carry, charges, that, are, multiples, of, the, charge, of, the, electron, certain, grand, unified, theories, predict, the, existence, of, monopoles, which, unlike, elementary, particles, are, solitons, localized, energy, packets, the, initial, results, of, using, these, models, to, estimate, the, number, of, monopoles, created, in, the, big, bang, contradicted, cosmological, observations, the, monopoles, would, have, been, so, plentiful, and, massive, that, they, would, have, long, since, halted, the, expansion, of, the, universe, however, the, idea, of, inflation, for, which, this, problem, served, as, a, partial, motivation, was, successful, in, solving, this, problem, creating, models, in, which, monopoles, existed, but, were, rare, enough, to, be, consistent, with, current, observations, some, organisms, can, detect, magnetic, fields, a, phenomenon, known, as, magnetoception, some, materials, in, living, things, are, ferromagnetic, though, it, is, unclear, if, the, magnetic, properties, serve, a, special, function, or, are, merely, a, byproduct, of, containing, iron, for, instance, chitons, a, type, of, marine, mollusk, produce, magnetite, to, harden, their, teeth, and, even, humans, produce, magnetite, in, bodily, tissue, magnetobiology, studies, the, effects, of, magnetic, fields, on, living, organisms, fields, naturally, produced, by, an, organism, are, known, as, biomagnetism, many, biological, organisms, are, mostly, made, of, water, and, because, water, is, diamagnetic, extremely, strong, magnetic, fields, can, repel, these, living, things, in, the, years, after, 1820, andr, marie, amp, re, carried, out, numerous, experiments, in, which, he, measured, the, forces, between, direct, currents, in, particular, he, also, studied, the, magnetic, forces, between, non, parallel, wires, the, final, result, of, his, work, was, a, force, law, that, is, now, named, after, him, in, 1835, carl, friedrich, gauss, realized, that, ampere, s, force, law, in, its, original, form, can, be, explained, by, a, generalization, of, coulomb, s, law, gauss, s, force, law, states, that, the, electromagnetic, force, f, 1, textstyle, mathbf, f, 1, experienced, by, a, point, charge, q, 1, displaystyle, q, 1, with, trajectory, r, 1, t, displaystyle, mathbf, r, 1, t, in, the, vicinity, of, another, point, charge, q, 2, displaystyle, q, 2, with, trajectory, r, 2, t, displaystyle, mathbf, r, 2, t, in, a, vacuum, is, equal, to, the, central, force, where, r, r, 1, t, r, 2, t, textstyle, mathbf, r, mathbf, r, 1, t, mathbf, r, 2, t, is, the, distance, between, the, charges, and, v, r, 1, t, r, 2, t, textstyle, mathbf, v, dot, mathbf, r, 1, t, dot, mathbf, r, 2, t, is, the, relative, velocity, wilhelm, eduard, weber, confirmed, gauss, s, hypothesis, in, numerous, experiments, by, means, of, weber, electrodynamics, it, is, possible, to, explain, the, static, and, quasi, static, effects, in, the, non, relativistic, regime, of, classical, electrodynamics, without, magnetic, field, and, lorentz, force, since, 1870, maxwell, electrodynamics, has, been, developed, which, postulates, that, electric, and, magnetic, fields, exist, in, maxwell, s, electrodynamics, the, actual, electromagnetic, force, can, be, calculated, using, the, lorentz, force, which, like, the, weber, force, is, speed, dependent, however, maxwell, s, electrodynamics, is, not, fully, compatible, with, the, work, of, amp, re, gauss, and, weber, in, the, quasi, static, regime, in, particular, amp, re, s, original, force, law, and, the, biot, savart, law, are, only, equivalent, if, the, field, generating, conductor, loop, is, closed, maxwell, s, electrodynamics, therefore, represents, a, break, with, the, interpretation, of, magnetism, by, gauss, and, weber, since, in, maxwell, s, electrodynamics, it, is, no, longer, possible, to, deduce, the, magnetic, force, from, a, central, force, while, heuristic, explanations, based, on, classical, physics, can, be, formulated, diamagnetism, paramagnetism, and, ferromagnetism, can, be, fully, explained, only, using, quantum, theory, a, successful, model, was, developed, already, in, 1927, by, walter, heitler, and, fritz, london, who, derived, quantum, mechanically, how, hydrogen, molecules, are, formed, from, hydrogen, atoms, i, e, from, the, atomic, hydrogen, orbitals, u, a, displaystyle, u, a, and, u, b, displaystyle, u, b, centered, at, the, nuclei, a, and, b, see, below, that, this, leads, to, magnetism, is, not, at, all, obvious, but, will, be, explained, in, the, following, according, to, the, heitler, london, theory, so, called, two, body, molecular, displaystyle, sigma, orbitals, are, formed, namely, the, resulting, orbital, is, here, the, last, product, means, that, a, first, electron, r, 1, is, in, an, atomic, hydrogen, orbital, centered, at, the, second, nucleus, whereas, the, second, electron, runs, around, the, first, nucleus, this, exchange, phenomenon, is, an, expression, for, the, quantum, mechanical, property, that, particles, with, identical, properties, cannot, be, distinguished, it, is, specific, not, only, for, the, formation, of, chemical, bonds, but, also, for, magnetism, that, is, in, this, connection, the, term, exchange, interaction, arises, a, term, which, is, essential, for, the, origin, of, magnetism, and, which, is, stronger, roughly, by, factors, 100, and, even, by, 1000, than, the, energies, arising, from, the, electrodynamic, dipole, dipole, interaction, as, for, the, spin, function, s, 1, s, 2, displaystyle, chi, s, 1, s, 2, which, is, responsible, for, the, magnetism, we, have, the, already, mentioned, pauli, s, principle, namely, that, a, symmetric, orbital, i, e, with, the, sign, as, above, must, be, multiplied, with, an, antisymmetric, spin, function, i, e, with, a, sign, and, vice, versa, thus, i, e, not, only, u, a, displaystyle, u, a, and, u, b, displaystyle, u, b, must, be, substituted, by, and, respectively, the, first, entity, means, spin, up, the, second, one, spin, down, but, also, the, sign, by, the, sign, and, finally, r, i, by, the, discrete, values, s, i, 1, 2, thereby, we, have, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, displaystyle, alpha, 1, 2, beta, 1, 2, 1, and, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, displaystyle, alpha, 1, 2, beta, 1, 2, 0, the, singlet, state, i, e, the, sign, means, the, spins, are, antiparallel, i, e, for, the, solid, we, have, antiferromagnetism, and, for, two, atomic, molecules, one, has, diamagnetism, the, tendency, to, form, a, homoeopolar, chemical, bond, this, means, the, formation, of, a, symmetric, molecular, orbital, i, e, with, the, sign, results, through, the, pauli, principle, automatically, in, an, antisymmetric, spin, state, i, e, with, the, sign, in, contrast, the, coulomb, repulsion, of, the, electrons, i, e, the, tendency, that, they, try, to, avoid, each, other, by, this, repulsion, would, lead, to, an, antisymmetric, orbital, function, i, e, with, the, sign, of, these, two, particles, and, complementary, to, a, symmetric, spin, function, i, e, with, the, sign, one, of, the, so, called, triplet, functions, thus, now, the, spins, would, be, parallel, ferromagnetism, in, a, solid, paramagnetism, in, two, atomic, gases, the, last, mentioned, tendency, dominates, in, the, metals, iron, cobalt, and, nickel, and, in, some, rare, earths, which, are, ferromagnetic, most, of, the, other, metals, where, the, first, mentioned, tendency, dominates, are, nonmagnetic, e, g, sodium, aluminium, and, magnesium, or, antiferromagnetic, e, g, manganese, diatomic, gases, are, also, almost, exclusively, diamagnetic, and, not, paramagnetic, however, the, oxygen, molecule, because, of, the, involvement, of, orbitals, is, an, exception, important, for, the, life, sciences, the, heitler, london, considerations, can, be, generalized, to, the, heisenberg, model, of, magnetism, heisenberg, 1928, the, explanation, of, the, phenomena, is, thus, essentially, based, on, all, subtleties, of, quantum, mechanics, whereas, the, electrodynamics, covers, mainly, the, phenomenology
