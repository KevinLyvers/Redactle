in, physics, a, vapor, american, english, or, vapour, commonwealth, english, see, spelling, differences, is, a, substance, in, the, gas, phase, at, a, temperature, lower, than, its, critical, temperature, which, means, that, the, vapor, can, be, condensed, to, a, liquid, by, increasing, the, pressure, on, it, without, reducing, the, temperature, of, the, vapor, a, vapor, is, different, from, an, aerosol, an, aerosol, is, a, suspension, of, tiny, particles, of, liquid, solid, or, both, within, a, gas, for, example, water, has, a, critical, temperature, of, 647, k, 374, c, 705, f, which, is, the, highest, temperature, at, which, liquid, water, can, exist, at, any, pressure, in, the, atmosphere, at, ordinary, temperatures, gaseous, water, known, as, water, vapor, will, condense, into, a, liquid, if, its, partial, pressure, is, increased, sufficiently, a, vapor, may, co, exist, with, a, liquid, or, a, solid, when, this, is, true, the, two, phases, will, be, in, equilibrium, and, the, gas, partial, pressure, will, be, equal, to, the, equilibrium, vapor, pressure, of, the, liquid, or, solid, vapor, refers, to, a, gas, phase, at, a, temperature, where, the, same, substance, can, also, exist, in, the, liquid, or, solid, state, below, the, critical, temperature, of, the, substance, for, example, water, has, a, critical, temperature, of, 374, c, 647, k, which, is, the, highest, temperature, at, which, liquid, water, can, exist, if, the, vapor, is, in, contact, with, a, liquid, or, solid, phase, the, two, phases, will, be, in, a, state, of, equilibrium, the, term, gas, refers, to, a, compressible, fluid, phase, fixed, gases, are, gases, for, which, no, liquid, or, solid, can, form, at, the, temperature, of, the, gas, such, as, air, at, typical, ambient, temperatures, a, liquid, or, solid, does, not, have, to, boil, to, release, a, vapor, vapor, is, responsible, for, the, familiar, processes, of, cloud, formation, and, condensation, it, is, commonly, employed, to, carry, out, the, physical, processes, of, distillation, and, headspace, extraction, from, a, liquid, sample, prior, to, gas, chromatography, the, constituent, molecules, of, a, vapor, possess, vibrational, rotational, and, translational, motion, these, motions, are, considered, in, the, kinetic, theory, of, gases, the, vapor, pressure, is, the, equilibrium, pressure, from, a, liquid, or, a, solid, at, a, specific, temperature, the, equilibrium, vapor, pressure, of, a, liquid, or, solid, is, not, affected, by, the, amount, of, contact, with, the, liquid, or, solid, interface, the, normal, boiling, point, of, a, liquid, is, the, temperature, at, which, the, vapor, pressure, is, equal, to, normal, atmospheric, pressure, for, two, phase, systems, e, g, two, liquid, phases, the, vapor, pressure, of, the, individual, phases, are, equal, in, the, absence, of, stronger, inter, species, attractions, between, like, like, or, like, unlike, molecules, the, vapor, pressure, follows, raoult, s, law, which, states, that, the, partial, pressure, of, each, component, is, the, product, of, the, vapor, pressure, of, the, pure, component, and, its, mole, fraction, in, the, mixture, the, total, vapor, pressure, is, the, sum, of, the, component, partial, pressures, e, cigarettes, produce, aerosols, not, vapors, since, it, is, in, the, gas, phase, the, amount, of, vapor, present, is, quantified, by, the, partial, pressure, of, the, gas, also, vapors, obey, the, barometric, formula, in, a, gravitational, field, just, as, conventional, atmospheric, gases, do
