oscillation, is, the, repetitive, or, periodic, variation, typically, in, time, of, some, measure, about, a, central, value, often, a, point, of, equilibrium, or, between, two, or, more, different, states, familiar, examples, of, oscillation, include, a, swinging, pendulum, and, alternating, current, oscillations, can, be, used, in, physics, to, approximate, complex, interactions, such, as, those, between, atoms, oscillations, occur, not, only, in, mechanical, systems, but, also, in, dynamic, systems, in, virtually, every, area, of, science, for, example, the, beating, of, the, human, heart, for, circulation, business, cycles, in, economics, predator, prey, population, cycles, in, ecology, geothermal, geysers, in, geology, vibration, of, strings, in, guitar, and, other, string, instruments, periodic, firing, of, nerve, cells, in, the, brain, and, the, periodic, swelling, of, cepheid, variable, stars, in, astronomy, the, term, vibration, is, precisely, used, to, describe, a, mechanical, oscillation, oscillation, especially, rapid, oscillation, may, be, an, undesirable, phenomenon, in, process, control, and, control, theory, e, g, in, sliding, mode, control, where, the, aim, is, convergence, to, stable, state, in, these, cases, it, is, called, chattering, or, flapping, as, in, valve, chatter, and, route, flapping, the, simplest, mechanical, oscillating, system, is, a, weight, attached, to, a, linear, spring, subject, to, only, weight, and, tension, such, a, system, may, be, approximated, on, an, air, table, or, ice, surface, the, system, is, in, an, equilibrium, state, when, the, spring, is, static, if, the, system, is, displaced, from, the, equilibrium, there, is, a, net, restoring, force, on, the, mass, tending, to, bring, it, back, to, equilibrium, however, in, moving, the, mass, back, to, the, equilibrium, position, it, has, acquired, momentum, which, keeps, it, moving, beyond, that, position, establishing, a, new, restoring, force, in, the, opposite, sense, if, a, constant, force, such, as, gravity, is, added, to, the, system, the, point, of, equilibrium, is, shifted, the, time, taken, for, an, oscillation, to, occur, is, often, referred, to, as, the, oscillatory, period, the, systems, where, the, restoring, force, on, a, body, is, directly, proportional, to, its, displacement, such, as, the, dynamics, of, the, spring, mass, system, are, described, mathematically, by, the, simple, harmonic, oscillator, and, the, regular, periodic, motion, is, known, as, simple, harmonic, motion, in, the, spring, mass, system, oscillations, occur, because, at, the, static, equilibrium, displacement, the, mass, has, kinetic, energy, which, is, converted, into, potential, energy, stored, in, the, spring, at, the, extremes, of, its, path, the, spring, mass, system, illustrates, some, common, features, of, oscillation, namely, the, existence, of, an, equilibrium, and, the, presence, of, a, restoring, force, which, grows, stronger, the, further, the, system, deviates, from, equilibrium, in, the, case, of, the, spring, mass, system, hooke, s, law, states, that, the, restoring, force, of, a, spring, is, f, k, x, displaystyle, f, kx, by, using, newton, s, second, law, the, differential, equation, can, be, derived, x, k, m, x, 2, x, displaystyle, ddot, x, frac, k, m, x, omega, 2, x, where, k, m, textstyle, omega, sqrt, k, m, the, solution, to, this, differential, equation, produces, a, sinusoidal, position, function, x, t, a, cos, t, displaystyle, x, t, a, cos, omega, t, delta, where, is, the, frequency, of, the, oscillation, a, is, the, amplitude, and, is, the, phase, shift, of, the, function, these, are, determined, by, the, initial, conditions, of, the, system, because, cosine, oscillates, between, 1, and, 1, infinitely, our, spring, mass, system, would, oscillate, between, the, positive, and, negative, amplitude, forever, without, friction, in, two, or, three, dimensions, harmonic, oscillators, behave, similarly, to, one, dimension, the, simplest, example, of, this, is, an, isotropic, oscillator, where, the, restoring, force, is, proportional, to, the, displacement, from, equilibrium, with, the, same, restorative, constant, in, all, directions, f, k, r, displaystyle, vec, f, k, vec, r, this, produces, a, similar, solution, but, now, there, is, a, different, equation, for, every, direction, x, t, a, x, cos, t, x, y, t, a, y, cos, t, y, displaystyle, begin, aligned, x, t, a, x, cos, omega, t, delta, x, y, t, a, y, cos, omega, t, delta, y, vdots, end, aligned, with, anisotropic, oscillators, different, directions, have, different, constants, of, restoring, forces, the, solution, is, similar, to, isotropic, oscillators, but, there, is, a, different, frequency, in, each, direction, varying, the, frequencies, relative, to, each, other, can, produce, interesting, results, for, example, if, the, frequency, in, one, direction, is, twice, that, of, another, a, figure, eight, pattern, is, produced, if, the, ratio, of, frequencies, is, irrational, the, motion, is, quasiperiodic, this, motion, is, periodic, on, each, axis, but, is, not, periodic, with, respect, to, r, and, will, never, repeat, all, real, world, oscillator, systems, are, thermodynamically, irreversible, this, means, there, are, dissipative, processes, such, as, friction, or, electrical, resistance, which, continually, convert, some, of, the, energy, stored, in, the, oscillator, into, heat, in, the, environment, this, is, called, damping, thus, oscillations, tend, to, decay, with, time, unless, there, is, some, net, source, of, energy, into, the, system, the, simplest, description, of, this, decay, process, can, be, illustrated, by, oscillation, decay, of, the, harmonic, oscillator, damped, oscillators, are, created, when, a, resistive, force, is, introduced, which, is, dependent, on, the, first, derivative, of, the, position, or, in, this, case, velocity, the, differential, equation, created, by, newton, s, second, law, adds, in, this, resistive, force, with, an, arbitrary, constant, b, this, example, assumes, a, linear, dependence, on, velocity, m, x, b, x, k, x, 0, displaystyle, m, ddot, x, b, dot, x, kx, 0, this, equation, can, be, rewritten, as, before, x, 2, x, 0, 2, x, 0, displaystyle, ddot, x, 2, beta, dot, x, omega, 0, 2, x, 0, where, 2, b, m, textstyle, 2, beta, frac, b, m, this, produces, the, general, solution, x, t, e, t, c, 1, e, 1, t, c, 2, e, 1, t, displaystyle, x, t, e, beta, t, left, c, 1, e, omega, 1, t, c, 2, e, omega, 1, t, right, where, 1, 2, 0, 2, textstyle, omega, 1, sqrt, beta, 2, omega, 0, 2, the, exponential, term, outside, of, the, parenthesis, is, the, decay, function, and, is, the, damping, coefficient, there, are, 3, categories, of, damped, oscillators, under, damped, where, 0, over, damped, where, 0, and, critically, damped, where, 0, in, addition, an, oscillating, system, may, be, subject, to, some, external, force, as, when, an, ac, circuit, is, connected, to, an, outside, power, source, in, this, case, the, oscillation, is, said, to, be, driven, the, simplest, example, of, this, is, a, spring, mass, system, with, a, sinusoidal, driving, force, x, 2, x, 0, 2, x, f, t, displaystyle, ddot, x, 2, beta, dot, x, omega, 0, 2, x, f, t, where, f, t, f, 0, cos, t, displaystyle, f, t, f, 0, cos, omega, t, delta, this, gives, the, solution, x, t, a, cos, t, a, t, r, cos, 1, t, t, r, displaystyle, x, t, a, cos, omega, t, delta, a, tr, cos, omega, 1, t, delta, tr, where, a, f, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2,

right, the, second, term, of, x, t, is, the, transient, solution, to, the, differential, equation, the, transient, solution, can, be, found, by, using, the, initial, conditions, of, the, system, some, systems, can, be, excited, by, energy, transfer, from, the, environment, this, transfer, typically, occurs, where, systems, are, embedded, in, some, fluid, flow, for, example, the, phenomenon, of, flutter, in, aerodynamics, occurs, when, an, arbitrarily, small, displacement, of, an, aircraft, wing, from, its, equilibrium, results, in, an, increase, in, the, angle, of, attack, of, the, wing, on, the, air, flow, and, a, consequential, increase, in, lift, coefficient, leading, to, a, still, greater, displacement, at, sufficiently, large, displacements, the, stiffness, of, the, wing, dominates, to, provide, the, restoring, force, that, enables, an, oscillation, resonance, occurs, in, a, damped, driven, oscillator, when, 0, that, is, when, the, driving, frequency, is, equal, to, the, natural, frequency, of, the, system, when, this, occurs, the, denominator, of, the, amplitude, is, minimized, which, maximizes, the, amplitude, of, the, oscillations, the, harmonic, oscillator, and, the, systems, it, models, have, a, single, degree, of, freedom, more, complicated, systems, have, more, degrees, of, freedom, for, example, two, masses, and, three, springs, each, mass, being, attached, to, fixed, points, and, to, each, other, in, such, cases, the, behavior, of, each, variable, influences, that, of, the, others, this, leads, to, a, coupling, of, the, oscillations, of, the, individual, degrees, of, freedom, for, example, two, pendulum, clocks, of, identical, frequency, mounted, on, a, common, wall, will, tend, to, synchronise, this, phenomenon, was, first, observed, by, christiaan, huygens, in, 1665, the, apparent, motions, of, the, compound, oscillations, typically, appears, very, complicated, but, a, more, economic, computationally, simpler, and, conceptually, deeper, description, is, given, by, resolving, the, motion, into, normal, modes, the, simplest, form, of, coupled, oscillators, is, a, 3, spring, 2, mass, system, where, masses, and, spring, constants, are, the, same, this, problem, begins, with, deriving, newton, s, second, law, for, both, masses, m, 1, x, 1, k, 1, k, 2, x, 1, k, 2, x, 2, m, 2, x, 2, k, 2, x, 1, k, 2, k, 3, x, 2, displaystyle, begin, cases, m, 1, ddot, x, 1, k, 1, k, 2, x, 1, k, 2, x, 2, m, 2, ddot, x, 2, k, 2, x, 1, k, 2, k, 3, x, 2, end, cases, the, equations, are, then, generalized, into, matrix, form, f, m, x, k, x, displaystyle, f, m, ddot, x, kx, where, m, m, 1, 0, 0, m, 2, displaystyle, m, begin, bmatrix, m, 1, 0, 0, m, 2, end, bmatrix, x, x, 1, x, 2, displaystyle, x, begin, bmatrix, x, 1, x, 2, end, bmatrix, and, k, k, 1, k, 2, k, 2, k, 2, k, 2, k, 3, displaystyle, k, begin, bmatrix, k, 1, k, 2, k, 2, k, 2, k, 2, k, 3, end, bmatrix, the, values, of, k, and, m, can, be, substituted, into, the, matrices, m, 1, m, 2, m, k, 1, k, 2, k, 3, k, m, m, 0, 0, m, k, 2, k, k, k, 2, k, displaystyle, begin, aligned, m, 1, m, 2, m, k, 1, k, 2, k, 3, k, m, begin, bmatrix, m, 0, 0, m, end, bmatrix, k, begin, bmatrix, 2k, k, k, 2k, end, bmatrix, end, aligned, these, matrices, can, now, be, plugged, into, the, general, solution, k, m, 2, a, 0, 2, k, m, 2, k, k, 2, k, m, 2, 0, displaystyle, begin, aligned, left, k, m, omega, 2, right, a, 0, begin, bmatrix, 2k, m, omega, 2, k, k, 2k, m, omega, 2, end, bmatrix, 0, end, aligned, the, determinant, of, this, matrix, yields, a, quadratic, equation,

aligned, depending, on, the, starting, point, of, the, masses, this, system, has, 2, possible, frequencies, or, a, combination, of, the, two, if, the, masses, are, started, with, their, displacements, in, the, same, direction, the, frequency, is, that, of, a, single, mass, system, because, the, middle, spring, is, never, extended, if, the, two, masses, are, started, in, opposite, directions, the, second, faster, frequency, is, the, frequency, of, the, system, more, special, cases, are, the, coupled, oscillators, where, energy, alternates, between, two, forms, of, oscillation, well, known, is, the, wilberforce, pendulum, where, the, oscillation, alternates, between, the, elongation, of, a, vertical, spring, and, the, rotation, of, an, object, at, the, end, of, that, spring, coupled, oscillators, are, a, common, description, of, two, related, but, different, phenomena, one, case, is, where, both, oscillations, affect, each, other, mutually, which, usually, leads, to, the, occurrence, of, a, single, entrained, oscillation, state, where, both, oscillate, with, a, compromise, frequency, another, case, is, where, one, external, oscillation, affects, an, internal, oscillation, but, is, not, affected, by, this, in, this, case, the, regions, of, synchronization, known, as, arnold, tongues, can, lead, to, highly, complex, phenomena, as, for, instance, chaotic, dynamics, in, physics, a, system, with, a, set, of, conservative, forces, and, an, equilibrium, point, can, be, approximated, as, a, harmonic, oscillator, near, equilibrium, an, example, of, this, is, the, lennard, jones, potential, where, the, potential, is, given, by, u, r, u, 0, r, 0, r, 12, r, 0, r, 6, displaystyle, u, r, u, 0, left, the, equilibrium, points, of, the, function, are, then, found, d, u, d, r, 0, u, 0, 12, r, 0, 12, r, 13, 6, r, 0, 6, r, 7, r, r, 0, displaystyle, begin, aligned, frac, du, dr, 0, u, 0, left, rightarrow, r, approx, r, 0, end, aligned, the, second, derivative, is, then, found, and, used, to, be, the, effective, potential, constant, eff, d, 2, u, d, r, 2, r, r, 0, u, 0, 12, 13, r, 0, 12, r, 14, 6, 7, r, 0, 6, r, 8, 114, u, 0, r, 2, displaystyle, begin, aligned, gamma, text, eff, left, frac, d, 2, u, dr, 2, right, r, r, 0, u, 0, left, frac, 114u, 0, r, 2, end, aligned, the, system, will, undergo, oscillations, near, the, equilibrium, point, the, force, that, creates, these, oscillations, is, derived, from, the, effective, potential, constant, above, f, eff, r, r, 0, m, eff, r, displaystyle, f, gamma, text, eff, r, r, 0, m, text, eff, ddot, r, this, differential, equation, can, be, re, written, in, the, form, of, a, simple, harmonic, oscillator, r, eff, m, eff, r, r, 0, 0, displaystyle, ddot, r, frac, gamma, text, eff, m, text, eff, r, r, 0, 0, thus, the, frequency, of, small, oscillations, is, 0, eff, m, eff, 114, u, 0, r, 2, m, eff, displaystyle, omega, 0, sqrt, frac, gamma, text, eff, m, text, eff, sqrt, frac, 114u, 0, r,

by, looking, at, the, potential, curve, of, the, system, by, thinking, of, the, potential, curve, as, a, hill, in, which, if, one, placed, a, ball, anywhere, on, the, curve, the, ball, would, roll, down, with, the, slope, of, the, potential, curve, this, is, true, due, to, the, relationship, between, potential, energy, and, force, d, u, d, t, f, r, displaystyle, frac, du, dt, f, r, by, thinking, of, the, potential, in, this, way, one, will, see, that, at, any, local, minimum, there, is, a, well, in, which, the, ball, would, roll, back, and, forth, oscillate, between, r, min, displaystyle, r, text, min, and, r, max, displaystyle, r, text, max, this, approximation, is, also, useful, for, thinking, of, kepler, orbits, as, the, number, of, degrees, of, freedom, becomes, arbitrarily, large, a, system, approaches, continuity, examples, include, a, string, or, the, surface, of, a, body, of, water, such, systems, have, in, the, classical, limit, an, infinite, number, of, normal, modes, and, their, oscillations, occur, in, the, form, of, waves, that, can, characteristically, propagate, the, mathematics, of, oscillation, deals, with, the, quantification, of, the, amount, that, a, sequence, or, function, tends, to, move, between, extremes, there, are, several, related, notions, oscillation, of, a, sequence, of, real, numbers, oscillation, of, a, real, valued, function, at, a, point, and, oscillation, of, a, function, on, an, interval, or, open, set
