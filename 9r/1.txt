the, scientific, method, is, an, empirical, method, for, acquiring, knowledge, that, has, characterized, the, development, of, science, since, at, least, the, 17th, century, the, scientific, method, involves, careful, observation, coupled, with, rigorous, scepticism, because, cognitive, assumptions, can, distort, the, interpretation, of, the, observation, scientific, inquiry, includes, creating, a, hypothesis, through, inductive, reasoning, testing, it, through, experiments, and, statistical, analysis, and, adjusting, or, discarding, the, hypothesis, based, on, the, results, although, procedures, vary, from, one, field, of, inquiry, to, another, the, underlying, process, is, often, similar, the, process, in, the, scientific, method, involves, making, conjectures, hypothetical, explanations, deriving, predictions, from, the, hypotheses, as, logical, consequences, and, then, carrying, out, experiments, or, empirical, observations, based, on, those, predictions, a, hypothesis, is, a, conjecture, based, on, knowledge, obtained, while, seeking, answers, to, the, question, the, hypothesis, might, be, very, specific, or, it, might, be, broad, scientists, then, test, hypotheses, by, conducting, experiments, or, studies, a, scientific, hypothesis, must, be, falsifiable, implying, that, it, is, possible, to, identify, a, possible, outcome, of, an, experiment, or, observation, that, conflicts, with, predictions, deduced, from, the, hypothesis, otherwise, the, hypothesis, cannot, be, meaningfully, tested, while, the, scientific, method, is, often, presented, as, a, fixed, sequence, of, steps, it, represents, rather, a, set, of, general, principles, not, all, steps, take, place, in, every, scientific, inquiry, nor, to, the, same, degree, and, they, are, not, always, in, the, same, order, the, history, of, scientific, method, considers, changes, in, the, methodology, of, scientific, inquiry, as, distinct, from, the, history, of, science, itself, the, development, of, rules, for, scientific, reasoning, has, not, been, straightforward, scientific, method, has, been, the, subject, of, intense, and, recurring, debate, throughout, the, history, of, science, and, eminent, natural, philosophers, and, scientists, have, argued, for, the, primacy, of, one, or, another, approach, to, establishing, scientific, knowledge, different, early, expressions, of, empiricism, and, the, scientific, method, can, be, found, throughout, history, for, instance, with, the, ancient, stoics, epicurus, alhazen, avicenna, al, biruni, roger, bacon, and, william, of, ockham, in, the, scientific, revolution, of, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, some, of, the, most, important, developments, were, the, furthering, of, empiricism, by, francis, bacon, and, robert, hooke, the, rationalist, approach, described, by, ren, descartes, and, inductivism, brought, to, particular, prominence, by, isaac, newton, and, those, who, followed, him, experiments, were, advocated, by, francis, bacon, and, performed, by, giambattista, della, porta, johannes, kepler, and, galileo, galilei, there, was, particular, development, aided, by, theoretical, works, by, a, skeptic, francisco, sanches, by, idealists, as, well, as, empiricists, john, locke, george, berkeley, and, david, hume, a, sea, voyage, from, america, to, europe, afforded, c, s, peirce, the, distance, to, clarify, his, ideas, gradually, resulting, in, the, hypothetico, deductive, model, formulated, in, the, 20th, century, the, model, has, undergone, significant, revision, since, first, proposed, the, term, scientific, method, emerged, in, the, 19th, century, as, a, result, of, significant, institutional, development, of, science, and, terminologies, establishing, clear, boundaries, between, science, and, non, science, such, as, scientist, and, pseudoscience, appearing, throughout, the, 1830s, and, 1850s, when, baconianism, was, popular, naturalists, like, william, whewell, john, herschel, and, john, stuart, mill, engaged, in, debates, over, induction, and, facts, and, were, focused, on, how, to, generate, knowledge, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, a, debate, over, realism, vs, antirealism, was, conducted, as, powerful, scientific, theories, extended, beyond, the, realm, of, the, observable, the, term, scientific, method, came, into, popular, use, in, the, twentieth, century, dewey, s, 1910, book, how, we, think, inspired, popular, guidelines, appearing, in, dictionaries, and, science, textbooks, although, there, was, little, consensus, over, its, meaning, although, there, was, growth, through, the, middle, of, the, twentieth, century, by, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, numerous, influential, philosophers, of, science, such, as, thomas, kuhn, and, paul, feyerabend, had, questioned, the, universality, of, the, scientific, method, and, in, doing, so, largely, replaced, the, notion, of, science, as, a, homogeneous, and, universal, method, with, that, of, it, being, a, heterogeneous, and, local, practice, in, particular, paul, feyerabend, in, the, 1975, first, edition, of, his, book, against, method, argued, against, there, being, any, universal, rules, of, science, karl, popper, and, gauch, 2003, disagree, with, feyerabend, s, claim, later, stances, include, physicist, lee, smolin, s, 2013, essay, there, is, no, scientific, method, in, which, he, espouses, two, ethical, principles, and, historian, of, science, daniel, thurs, chapter, in, the, 2015, book, newton, s, apple, and, other, myths, about, science, which, concluded, that, the, scientific, method, is, a, myth, or, at, best, an, idealization, as, myths, are, beliefs, they, are, subject, to, the, narrative, fallacy, as, taleb, points, out, philosophers, robert, nola, and, howard, sankey, in, their, 2007, book, theories, of, scientific, method, said, that, debates, over, the, scientific, method, continue, and, argued, that, feyerabend, despite, the, title, of, against, method, accepted, certain, rules, of, method, and, attempted, to, justify, those, rules, with, a, meta, methodology, staddon, 2017, argues, it, is, a, mistake, to, try, following, rules, in, the, absence, of, an, algorithmic, scientific, method, in, that, case, science, is, best, understood, through, examples, but, algorithmic, methods, such, as, disproof, of, existing, theory, by, experiment, have, been, used, since, alhacen, 1027, and, his, book, of, optics, and, galileo, 1638, and, his, two, new, sciences, and, the, assayer, which, still, stand, as, scientific, method, the, basic, elements, of, the, scientific, method, are, illustrated, by, the, following, example, which, occurred, from, 1944, to, 1953, from, the, discovery, of, the, structure, of, dna, marked, with, and, indented, the, scientific, method, is, the, process, by, which, science, is, carried, out, as, in, other, areas, of, inquiry, science, through, the, scientific, method, can, build, on, previous, knowledge, and, can, unify, understanding, of, its, topics, of, study, over, time, this, model, can, be, seen, to, underlie, the, scientific, revolution, the, overall, process, involves, making, conjectures, hypotheses, deriving, predictions, from, them, as, logical, consequences, and, then, carrying, out, experiments, based, on, those, predictions, to, determine, whether, the, original, conjecture, was, correct, however, there, are, difficulties, in, a, formulaic, statement, of, method, though, the, scientific, method, is, often, presented, as, a, fixed, sequence, of, steps, these, actions, are, better, considered, as, general, principles, not, all, steps, take, place, in, every, scientific, inquiry, nor, to, the, same, degree, and, they, are, not, always, done, in, the, same, order, as, noted, by, scientist, and, philosopher, william, whewell, 1794, 1866, invention, sagacity, genius, are, required, at, every, step, there, are, different, ways, of, outlining, the, basic, method, used, for, scientific, inquiry, the, scientific, community, and, philosophers, of, science, generally, agree, on, the, following, classification, of, method, components, these, methodological, elements, and, organization, of, procedures, tend, to, be, more, characteristic, of, experimental, sciences, than, social, sciences, nonetheless, the, cycle, of, formulating, hypotheses, testing, and, analyzing, the, results, and, formulating, new, hypotheses, will, resemble, the, cycle, described, below, the, scientific, method, is, an, iterative, cyclical, process, through, which, information, is, continually, revised, it, is, generally, recognized, to, develop, advances, in, knowledge, through, the, following, elements, in, varying, combinations, or, contributions, each, element, of, the, scientific, method, is, subject, to, peer, review, for, possible, mistakes, these, activities, do, not, describe, all, that, scientists, do, but, apply, mostly, to, experimental, sciences, e, g, physics, chemistry, biology, and, psychology, the, elements, above, are, often, taught, in, the, educational, system, as, the, scientific, method, the, scientific, method, is, not, a, single, recipe, it, requires, intelligence, imagination, and, creativity, in, this, sense, it, is, not, a, mindless, set, of, standards, and, procedures, to, follow, but, is, rather, an, ongoing, cycle, constantly, developing, more, useful, accurate, and, comprehensive, models, and, methods, for, example, when, einstein, developed, the, special, and, general, theories, of, relativity, he, did, not, in, any, way, refute, or, discount, newton, s, principia, on, the, contrary, if, the, astronomically, massive, the, feather, light, and, the, extremely, fast, are, removed, from, einstein, s, theories, all, phenomena, newton, could, not, have, observed, newton, s, equations, are, what, remain, einstein, s, theories, are, expansions, and, refinements, of, newton, s, theories, and, thus, increase, confidence, in, newton, s, work, an, iterative, pragmatic, scheme, of, the, four, points, above, is, sometimes, offered, as, a, guideline, for, proceeding, the, iterative, cycle, inherent, in, this, step, by, step, method, goes, from, point, 3, to, 6, and, back, to, 3, again, while, this, schema, outlines, a, typical, hypothesis, testing, method, many, philosophers, historians, and, sociologists, of, science, including, paul, feyerabend, claim, that, such, descriptions, of, scientific, method, have, little, relation, to, the, ways, that, science, is, actually, practiced, in, 1950, it, was, known, that, genetic, inheritance, had, a, mathematical, description, starting, with, the, studies, of, gregor, mendel, and, that, dna, contained, genetic, information, oswald, avery, s, transforming, principle, but, the, mechanism, of, storing, genetic, information, i, e, genes, in, dna, was, unclear, researchers, in, bragg, s, laboratory, at, cambridge, university, made, x, ray, diffraction, pictures, of, various, molecules, starting, with, crystals, of, salt, and, proceeding, to, more, complicated, substances, using, clues, painstakingly, assembled, over, decades, beginning, with, its, chemical, composition, it, was, determined, that, it, should, be, possible, to, characterize, the, physical, structure, of, dna, and, the, x, ray, images, would, be, the, vehicle, the, scientific, method, depends, upon, increasingly, sophisticated, characterizations, of, the, subjects, of, investigation, the, subjects, can, also, be, called, unsolved, problems, or, the, unknowns, for, example, benjamin, franklin, conjectured, correctly, that, st, elmo, s, fire, was, electrical, in, nature, but, it, has, taken, a, long, series, of, experiments, and, theoretical, changes, to, establish, this, while, seeking, the, pertinent, properties, of, the, subjects, careful, thought, may, also, entail, some, definitions, and, observations, these, observations, often, demand, careful, measurements, and, or, counting, can, take, the, form, of, expansive, empirical, research, a, scientific, question, can, refer, to, the, explanation, of, a, specific, observation, as, in, why, is, the, sky, blue, but, can, also, be, open, ended, as, in, how, can, i, design, a, drug, to, cure, this, particular, disease, this, stage, frequently, involves, finding, and, evaluating, evidence, from, previous, experiments, personal, scientific, observations, or, assertions, as, well, as, the, work, of, other, scientists, if, the, answer, is, already, known, a, different, question, that, builds, on, the, evidence, can, be, posed, when, applying, the, scientific, method, to, research, determining, a, good, question, can, be, very, difficult, and, it, will, affect, the, outcome, of, the, investigation, the, systematic, careful, collection, of, measurements, or, counts, of, relevant, quantities, is, often, the, critical, difference, between, pseudo, sciences, such, as, alchemy, and, science, such, as, chemistry, or, biology, scientific, measurements, are, usually, tabulated, graphed, or, mapped, and, statistical, manipulations, such, as, correlation, and, regression, performed, on, them, the, measurements, might, be, made, in, a, controlled, setting, such, as, a, laboratory, or, made, on, more, or, less, inaccessible, or, unmanipulatable, objects, such, as, stars, or, human, populations, the, measurements, often, require, specialized, scientific, instruments, such, as, thermometers, spectroscopes, particle, accelerators, or, voltmeters, and, the, progress, of, a, scientific, field, is, usually, intimately, tied, to, their, invention, and, improvement, i, am, not, accustomed, to, saying, anything, with, certainty, after, only, one, or, two, observations, the, scientific, definition, of, a, term, sometimes, differs, substantially, from, its, natural, language, usage, for, example, mass, and, weight, overlap, in, meaning, in, common, discourse, but, have, distinct, meanings, in, mechanics, scientific, quantities, are, often, characterized, by, their, units, of, measure, which, can, later, be, described, in, terms, of, conventional, physical, units, when, communicating, the, work, new, theories, are, sometimes, developed, after, realizing, certain, terms, have, not, previously, been, sufficiently, clearly, defined, for, example, albert, einstein, s, first, paper, on, relativity, begins, by, defining, simultaneity, and, the, means, for, determining, length, these, ideas, were, skipped, over, by, isaac, newton, with, i, do, not, define, time, space, place, and, motion, as, being, well, known, to, all, einstein, s, paper, then, demonstrates, that, they, viz, absolute, time, and, length, independent, of, motion, were, approximations, francis, crick, cautions, us, that, when, characterizing, a, subject, however, it, can, be, premature, to, define, something, when, it, remains, ill, understood, in, crick, s, study, of, consciousness, he, actually, found, it, easier, to, study, awareness, in, the, visual, system, rather, than, to, study, free, will, for, example, his, cautionary, example, was, the, gene, the, gene, was, much, more, poorly, understood, before, watson, and, crick, s, pioneering, discovery, of, the, structure, of, dna, it, would, have, been, counterproductive, to, spend, much, time, on, the, definition, of, the, gene, before, them, linus, pauling, proposed, that, dna, might, be, a, triple, helix, this, hypothesis, was, also, considered, by, francis, crick, and, james, d, watson, but, discarded, when, watson, and, crick, learned, of, pauling, s, hypothesis, they, understood, from, existing, data, that, pauling, was, wrong, and, that, pauling, would, soon, admit, his, difficulties, with, that, structure, a, hypothesis, is, a, suggested, explanation, of, a, phenomenon, or, alternately, a, reasoned, proposal, suggesting, a, possible, correlation, between, or, among, a, set, of, phenomena, normally, hypotheses, have, the, form, of, a, mathematical, model, sometimes, but, not, always, they, can, also, be, formulated, as, existential, statements, stating, that, some, particular, instance, of, the, phenomenon, being, studied, has, some, characteristic, and, causal, explanations, which, have, the, general, form, of, universal, statements, stating, that, every, instance, of, the, phenomenon, has, a, particular, characteristic, scientists, are, free, to, use, whatever, resources, they, have, their, own, creativity, ideas, from, other, fields, inductive, reasoning, bayesian, inference, and, so, on, to, imagine, possible, explanations, for, a, phenomenon, under, study, albert, einstein, once, observed, that, there, is, no, logical, bridge, between, phenomena, and, their, theoretical, principles, charles, sanders, peirce, borrowing, a, page, from, aristotle, prior, analytics, 2, 25, described, the, incipient, stages, of, inquiry, instigated, by, the, irritation, of, doubt, to, venture, a, plausible, guess, as, abductive, reasoning, ii, p, 290, the, history, of, science, is, filled, with, stories, of, scientists, claiming, a, flash, of, inspiration, or, a, hunch, which, then, motivated, them, to, look, for, evidence, to, support, or, refute, their, idea, michael, polanyi, made, such, creativity, the, centerpiece, of, his, discussion, of, methodology, william, glen, observes, that, the, success, of, a, hypothesis, or, its, service, to, science, lies, not, simply, in, its, perceived, truth, or, power, to, displace, subsume, or, reduce, a, predecessor, idea, but, perhaps, more, in, its, ability, to, stimulate, the, research, that, will, illuminate, bald, suppositions, and, areas, of, vagueness, in, general, scientists, tend, to, look, for, theories, that, are, elegant, or, beautiful, scientists, often, use, these, terms, to, refer, to, a, theory, that, is, following, the, known, facts, but, is, nevertheless, relatively, simple, and, easy, to, handle, occam, s, razor, serves, as, a, rule, of, thumb, for, choosing, the, most, desirable, amongst, a, group, of, equally, explanatory, hypotheses, to, minimize, the, confirmation, bias, that, results, from, entertaining, a, single, hypothesis, strong, inference, emphasizes, the, need, for, entertaining, multiple, alternative, hypotheses, and, avoiding, artifacts, james, d, watson, francis, crick, and, others, hypothesized, that, dna, had, a, helical, structure, this, implied, that, dna, s, x, ray, diffraction, pattern, would, be, x, shaped, this, prediction, followed, from, the, work, of, cochran, crick, and, vand, and, independently, by, stokes, the, cochran, crick, vand, stokes, theorem, provided, a, mathematical, explanation, for, the, empirical, observation, that, diffraction, from, helical, structures, produces, x, shaped, patterns, in, their, first, paper, watson, and, crick, also, noted, that, the, double, helix, structure, they, proposed, provided, a, simple, mechanism, for, dna, replication, writing, it, has, not, escaped, our, notice, that, the, specific, pairing, we, have, postulated, immediately, suggests, a, possible, copying, mechanism, for, the, genetic, material, any, useful, hypothesis, will, enable, predictions, by, reasoning, including, deductive, reasoning, it, might, predict, the, outcome, of, an, experiment, in, a, laboratory, setting, or, the, observation, of, a, phenomenon, in, nature, the, prediction, can, also, be, statistical, and, deal, only, with, probabilities, it, is, essential, that, the, outcome, of, testing, such, a, prediction, be, currently, unknown, only, in, this, case, does, a, successful, outcome, increase, the, probability, that, the, hypothesis, is, true, if, the, outcome, is, already, known, it, is, called, a, consequence, and, should, have, already, been, considered, while, formulating, the, hypothesis, if, the, predictions, are, not, accessible, by, observation, or, experience, the, hypothesis, is, not, yet, testable, and, so, will, remain, to, that, extent, unscientific, in, a, strict, sense, a, new, technology, or, theory, might, make, the, necessary, experiments, feasible, for, example, while, a, hypothesis, on, the, existence, of, other, intelligent, species, may, be, convincing, with, scientifically, based, speculation, no, known, experiment, can, test, this, hypothesis, therefore, science, itself, can, have, little, to, say, about, the, possibility, in, the, future, a, new, technique, may, allow, for, an, experimental, test, and, the, speculation, would, then, become, part, of, accepted, science, for, example, einstein, s, theory, of, general, relativity, makes, several, specific, predictions, about, the, observable, structure, of, spacetime, such, as, that, light, bends, in, a, gravitational, field, and, that, the, amount, of, bending, depends, in, a, precise, way, on, the, strength, of, that, gravitational, field, arthur, eddington, s, observations, made, during, a, 1919, solar, eclipse, supported, general, relativity, rather, than, newtonian, gravitation, watson, and, crick, showed, an, initial, and, incorrect, proposal, for, the, structure, of, dna, to, a, team, from, king, s, college, london, rosalind, franklin, maurice, wilkins, and, raymond, gosling, franklin, immediately, spotted, the, flaws, which, concerned, the, water, content, later, watson, saw, franklin, s, photo, 51, a, detailed, x, ray, diffraction, image, which, showed, an, x, shape, and, was, able, to, confirm, the, structure, was, helical, once, predictions, are, made, they, can, be, sought, by, experiments, if, the, test, results, contradict, the, predictions, the, hypotheses, which, entailed, them, are, called, into, question, and, become, less, tenable, sometimes, the, experiments, are, conducted, incorrectly, or, are, not, very, well, designed, when, compared, to, a, crucial, experiment, if, the, experimental, results, confirm, the, predictions, then, the, hypotheses, are, considered, more, likely, to, be, correct, but, might, still, be, wrong, and, continue, to, be, subject, to, further, testing, the, experimental, control, is, a, technique, for, dealing, with, observational, error, this, technique, uses, the, contrast, between, multiple, samples, or, observations, or, populations, under, differing, conditions, to, see, what, varies, or, what, remains, the, same, we, vary, the, conditions, for, the, acts, of, measurement, to, help, isolate, what, has, changed, mill, s, canons, can, then, help, us, figure, out, what, the, important, factor, is, factor, analysis, is, one, technique, for, discovering, the, important, factor, in, an, effect, depending, on, the, predictions, the, experiments, can, have, different, shapes, it, could, be, a, classical, experiment, in, a, laboratory, setting, a, double, blind, study, or, an, archaeological, excavation, even, taking, a, plane, from, new, york, to, paris, is, an, experiment, that, tests, the, aerodynamical, hypotheses, used, for, constructing, the, plane, these, institutions, thereby, reduce, the, research, function, to, a, cost, benefit, which, is, expressed, as, money, and, the, time, and, attention, of, the, researchers, to, be, expended, in, exchange, for, a, report, to, their, constituents, current, large, instruments, such, as, cern, s, large, hadron, collider, lhc, or, ligo, or, the, national, ignition, facility, nif, or, the, international, space, station, iss, or, the, james, webb, space, telescope, jwst, entail, expected, costs, of, billions, of, dollars, and, timeframes, extending, over, decades, these, kinds, of, institutions, affect, public, policy, on, a, national, or, even, international, basis, and, the, researchers, would, require, shared, access, to, such, machines, and, their, adjunct, infrastructure, scientists, assume, an, attitude, of, openness, and, accountability, on, the, part, of, those, experimenting, detailed, record, keeping, is, essential, to, aid, in, recording, and, reporting, on, the, experimental, results, and, supports, the, effectiveness, and, integrity, of, the, procedure, they, will, also, assist, in, reproducing, the, experimental, results, likely, by, others, traces, of, this, approach, can, be, seen, in, the, work, of, hipparchus, 190, 120, bce, when, determining, a, value, for, the, precession, of, the, earth, while, controlled, experiments, can, be, seen, in, the, works, of, al, battani, 853, 929, ce, and, alhazen, 965, 1039, ce, watson, and, crick, then, produced, their, model, using, this, information, along, with, the, previously, known, information, about, dna, s, composition, especially, chargaff, s, rules, of, base, pairing, after, considerable, fruitless, experimentation, being, discouraged, by, their, superior, from, continuing, and, numerous, false, starts, watson, and, crick, were, able, to, infer, the, essential, structure, of, dna, by, concrete, modeling, of, the, physical, shapes, of, the, nucleotides, which, comprise, it, they, were, guided, by, the, bond, lengths, which, had, been, deduced, by, linus, pauling, and, by, rosalind, franklin, s, x, ray, diffraction, images, the, scientific, method, is, iterative, at, any, stage, it, is, possible, to, refine, its, accuracy, and, precision, so, that, some, consideration, will, lead, the, scientist, to, repeat, an, earlier, part, of, the, process, failure, to, develop, an, interesting, hypothesis, may, lead, a, scientist, to, re, define, the, subject, under, consideration, failure, of, a, hypothesis, to, produce, interesting, and, testable, predictions, may, lead, to, reconsideration, of, the, hypothesis, or, of, the, definition, of, the, subject, failure, of, an, experiment, to, produce, interesting, results, may, lead, a, scientist, to, reconsider, the, experimental, method, the, hypothesis, or, the, definition, of, the, subject, this, manner, of, iteration, can, span, decades, and, sometimes, centuries, published, papers, can, be, built, upon, for, example, by, 1027, alhazen, based, on, his, measurements, of, the, refraction, of, light, was, able, to, deduce, that, outer, space, was, less, dense, than, air, that, is, the, body, of, the, heavens, is, rarer, than, the, body, of, air, in, 1079, ibn, mu, adh, s, treatise, on, twilight, was, able, to, infer, that, earth, s, atmosphere, was, 50, miles, thick, based, on, atmospheric, refraction, of, the, sun, s, rays, this, is, why, the, scientific, method, is, often, represented, as, circular, new, information, leads, to, new, characterisations, and, the, cycle, of, science, continues, measurements, collected, can, be, archived, passed, onwards, and, used, by, others, other, scientists, may, start, their, own, research, and, enter, the, process, at, any, stage, they, might, adopt, the, characterization, and, formulate, their, own, hypothesis, or, they, might, adopt, the, hypothesis, and, deduce, their, own, predictions, often, the, experiment, is, not, done, by, the, person, who, made, the, prediction, and, the, characterization, is, based, on, experiments, done, by, someone, else, published, results, of, experiments, can, also, serve, as, a, hypothesis, predicting, their, own, reproducibility, science, is, a, social, enterprise, and, scientific, work, tends, to, be, accepted, by, the, scientific, community, when, it, has, been, confirmed, crucially, experimental, and, theoretical, results, must, be, reproduced, by, others, within, the, scientific, community, researchers, have, given, their, lives, for, this, vision, georg, wilhelm, richmann, was, killed, by, ball, lightning, 1753, when, attempting, to, replicate, the, 1752, kite, flying, experiment, of, benjamin, franklin, if, an, experiment, cannot, be, repeated, to, produce, the, same, results, this, implies, that, the, original, results, might, have, been, in, error, as, a, result, it, is, common, for, a, single, experiment, to, be, performed, multiple, times, especially, when, there, are, uncontrolled, variables, or, other, indications, of, experimental, error, for, significant, or, surprising, results, other, scientists, may, also, attempt, to, replicate, the, results, for, themselves, especially, if, those, results, would, be, important, to, their, own, work, replication, has, become, a, contentious, issue, in, social, and, biomedical, science, where, treatments, are, administered, to, groups, of, individuals, typically, an, experimental, group, gets, the, treatment, such, as, a, drug, and, the, control, group, gets, a, placebo, john, ioannidis, in, 2005, pointed, out, that, the, method, being, used, has, led, to, many, findings, that, cannot, be, replicated, the, process, of, peer, review, involves, the, evaluation, of, the, experiment, by, experts, who, typically, give, their, opinions, anonymously, some, journals, request, that, the, experimenter, provide, lists, of, possible, peer, reviewers, especially, if, the, field, is, highly, specialized, peer, review, does, not, certify, the, correctness, of, the, results, only, that, in, the, opinion, of, the, reviewer, the, experiments, themselves, were, sound, based, on, the, description, supplied, by, the, experimenter, if, the, work, passes, peer, review, which, occasionally, may, require, new, experiments, requested, by, the, reviewers, it, will, be, published, in, a, peer, reviewed, scientific, journal, the, specific, journal, that, publishes, the, results, indicates, the, perceived, quality, of, the, work, scientists, typically, are, careful, in, recording, their, data, a, requirement, promoted, by, ludwik, fleck, 1896, 1961, and, others, though, not, typically, required, they, might, be, requested, to, supply, this, data, to, other, scientists, who, wish, to, replicate, their, original, results, or, parts, of, their, original, results, extending, to, the, sharing, of, any, experimental, samples, that, may, be, difficult, to, obtain, to, protect, against, bad, science, and, fraudulent, data, government, research, granting, agencies, such, as, the, national, science, foundation, and, science, journals, including, nature, and, science, have, a, policy, that, researchers, must, archive, their, data, and, methods, so, that, other, researchers, can, test, the, data, and, methods, and, build, on, the, research, that, has, gone, before, scientific, data, archiving, can, be, done, at, several, national, archives, in, the, u, s, or, the, world, data, center, the, unfettered, principles, of, science, are, to, strive, for, accuracy, and, the, creed, of, honesty, openness, already, being, a, matter, of, degrees, openness, is, restricted, by, the, general, rigour, of, scepticism, and, of, course, the, matter, of, non, science, smolin, in, 2013, espoused, ethical, principles, rather, than, giving, any, potentially, limited, definition, of, the, rules, of, inquiry, his, ideas, stand, in, the, context, of, the, scale, of, data, driven, and, big, science, which, has, seen, increased, importance, of, honesty, and, consequently, reproducibility, his, thought, is, that, science, is, a, community, effort, by, those, who, have, accreditation, and, are, working, within, the, community, he, also, warns, against, overzealous, parsimony, popper, previously, took, ethical, principles, even, further, going, as, far, as, to, ascribe, value, to, theories, only, if, they, were, falsifiable, popper, used, the, falsifiability, criterion, to, demarcate, a, scientific, theory, from, a, theory, like, astrology, both, explain, observations, but, the, scientific, theory, takes, the, risk, of, making, predictions, that, decide, whether, it, is, right, or, wrong, those, among, us, who, are, unwilling, to, expose, their, ideas, to, the, hazard, of, refutation, do, not, take, part, in, the, game, of, science, science, has, limits, those, limits, are, usually, deemed, to, be, answers, to, questions, that, aren, t, in, science, s, domain, such, as, faith, science, has, other, limits, as, well, as, it, seeks, to, make, true, statements, about, reality, the, nature, of, truth, and, the, discussion, on, how, scientific, statements, relate, to, reality, is, best, left, to, the, article, on, the, philosophy, of, science, here, more, immediately, topical, limitations, show, themselves, in, the, observation, of, reality, it, is, the, natural, limitations, of, scientific, inquiry, that, there, is, no, pure, observation, as, theory, is, required, to, interpret, empirical, data, and, observation, is, therefore, influenced, by, the, observer, s, conceptual, framework, as, science, is, an, unfinished, project, this, does, lead, to, difficulties, namely, that, false, conclusions, are, drawn, because, of, limited, information, an, example, here, are, the, experiments, of, kepler, and, brahe, used, by, hanson, to, illustrate, the, concept, despite, observing, the, same, sunrise, the, two, scientists, came, to, different, conclusions, their, intersubjectivity, leading, to, differing, conclusions, johannes, kepler, used, tycho, brahe, s, method, of, observation, which, was, to, project, the, image, of, the, sun, on, a, piece, of, paper, through, a, pinhole, aperture, instead, of, looking, directly, at, the, sun, he, disagreed, with, brahe, s, conclusion, that, total, eclipses, of, the, sun, were, impossible, because, contrary, to, brahe, he, knew, that, there, were, historical, accounts, of, total, eclipses, instead, he, deduced, that, the, images, taken, would, become, more, accurate, the, larger, the, aperture, this, fact, is, now, fundamental, for, optical, system, design, another, historic, example, here, is, the, discovery, of, neptune, credited, as, being, found, via, mathematics, because, previous, observers, didn, t, know, what, they, were, looking, at, scientific, endeavour, can, be, characterised, as, the, pursuit, of, truths, about, the, natural, world, or, as, the, elimination, of, doubt, about, the, same, the, former, is, the, direct, construction, of, explanations, from, empirical, data, and, logic, the, latter, the, reduction, of, potential, explanations, it, was, established, above, how, the, interpretation, of, empirical, data, is, theory, laden, so, neither, approach, is, trivial, the, ubiquitous, element, in, the, scientific, method, is, empiricism, which, holds, that, knowledge, is, created, by, a, process, involving, observation, scientific, theories, generalize, observations, this, is, in, opposition, to, stringent, forms, of, rationalism, which, holds, that, knowledge, is, created, by, the, human, intellect, later, clarified, by, popper, to, be, built, on, prior, theory, the, scientific, method, embodies, the, position, that, reason, alone, cannot, solve, a, particular, scientific, problem, it, unequivocally, refutes, claims, that, revelation, political, or, religious, dogma, appeals, to, tradition, commonly, held, beliefs, common, sense, or, currently, held, theories, pose, the, only, possible, means, of, demonstrating, truth, in, 1877, c, s, peirce, characterized, inquiry, in, general, not, as, the, pursuit, of, truth, per, se, but, as, the, struggle, to, move, from, irritating, inhibitory, doubts, born, of, surprises, disagreements, and, the, like, and, to, reach, a, secure, belief, the, belief, being, that, on, which, one, is, prepared, to, act, his, pragmatic, views, framed, scientific, inquiry, as, part, of, a, broader, spectrum, and, as, spurred, like, inquiry, generally, by, actual, doubt, not, mere, verbal, or, hyperbolic, doubt, which, he, held, to, be, fruitless, this, hyperbolic, doubt, peirce, argues, against, here, is, of, course, just, another, name, for, cartesian, doubt, associated, with, ren, descartes, it, is, a, methodological, route, to, certain, knowledge, by, identifying, what, can, t, be, doubted, a, strong, formulation, of, the, scientific, method, is, not, always, aligned, with, a, form, of, empiricism, in, which, the, empirical, data, is, put, forward, in, the, form, of, experience, or, other, abstracted, forms, of, knowledge, as, in, current, scientific, practice, the, use, of, scientific, modelling, and, reliance, on, abstract, typologies, and, theories, is, normally, accepted, in, 2010, hawking, suggested, that, physics, models, of, reality, should, simply, be, accepted, where, they, prove, to, make, useful, predictions, he, calls, the, concept, model, dependent, realism, rationality, embodies, the, essence, of, sound, reasoning, a, cornerstone, not, only, in, philosophical, discourse, but, also, in, the, realms, of, science, and, practical, decision, making, according, to, the, traditional, viewpoint, rationality, serves, a, dual, purpose, it, governs, beliefs, ensuring, they, align, with, logical, principles, and, it, steers, actions, directing, them, towards, coherent, and, beneficial, outcomes, this, understanding, underscores, the, pivotal, role, of, reason, in, shaping, our, understanding, of, the, world, and, in, informing, our, choices, and, behaviours, the, following, section, will, first, explore, beliefs, and, biases, and, then, get, to, the, rational, reasoning, most, associated, with, the, sciences, scientific, methodology, often, directs, that, hypotheses, be, tested, in, controlled, conditions, wherever, possible, this, is, frequently, possible, in, certain, areas, such, as, in, the, biological, sciences, and, more, difficult, in, other, areas, such, as, in, astronomy, the, practice, of, experimental, control, and, reproducibility, can, have, the, effect, of, diminishing, the, potentially, harmful, effects, of, circumstance, and, to, a, degree, personal, bias, for, example, pre, existing, beliefs, can, alter, the, interpretation, of, results, as, in, confirmation, bias, this, is, a, heuristic, that, leads, a, person, with, a, particular, belief, to, see, things, as, reinforcing, their, belief, even, if, another, observer, might, disagree, in, other, words, people, tend, to, observe, what, they, expect, to, observe, he, action, of, thought, is, excited, by, the, irritation, of, doubt, and, ceases, when, belief, is, attained, a, historical, example, is, the, belief, that, the, legs, of, a, galloping, horse, are, splayed, at, the, point, when, none, of, the, horse, s, legs, touch, the, ground, to, the, point, of, this, image, being, included, in, paintings, by, its, supporters, however, the, first, stop, action, pictures, of, a, horse, s, gallop, by, eadweard, muybridge, showed, this, to, be, false, and, that, the, legs, are, instead, gathered, together, another, important, human, bias, that, plays, a, role, is, a, preference, for, new, surprising, statements, see, appeal, to, novelty, which, can, result, in, a, search, for, evidence, that, the, new, is, true, poorly, attested, beliefs, can, be, believed, and, acted, upon, via, a, less, rigorous, heuristic, goldhaber, and, nieto, published, in, 2010, the, observation, that, if, theoretical, structures, with, many, closely, neighboring, subjects, are, described, by, connecting, theoretical, concepts, then, the, theoretical, structure, acquires, a, robustness, which, makes, it, increasingly, hard, though, certainly, never, impossible, to, overturn, when, a, narrative, is, constructed, its, elements, become, easier, to, believe, fleck, 1979, p, 27, notes, words, and, ideas, are, originally, phonetic, and, mental, equivalences, of, the, experiences, coinciding, with, them, such, proto, ideas, are, at, first, always, too, broad, and, insufficiently, specialized, once, a, structurally, complete, and, closed, system, of, opinions, consisting, of, many, details, and, relations, has, been, formed, it, offers, enduring, resistance, to, anything, that, contradicts, it, sometimes, these, relations, have, their, elements, assumed, a, priori, or, contain, some, other, logical, or, methodological, flaw, in, the, process, that, ultimately, produced, them, donald, m, mackay, has, analyzed, these, elements, in, terms, of, limits, to, the, accuracy, of, measurement, and, has, related, them, to, instrumental, elements, in, a, category, of, measurement, the, idea, of, there, being, two, opposed, justifications, for, truth, has, shown, up, through, out, the, history, of, scientific, method, as, analysis, versus, synthesis, non, ampliative, ampliative, or, even, confirmation, and, verification, and, there, are, other, kinds, of, reasoning, one, to, use, what, is, observed, to, build, towards, fundamental, truths, and, the, other, to, derive, from, those, fundamental, truths, more, specific, principles, deductive, reasoning, is, the, building, of, knowledge, based, on, what, has, been, shown, to, be, true, before, it, requires, the, assumption, of, fact, established, prior, and, given, the, truth, of, the, assumptions, a, valid, deduction, guarantees, the, truth, of, the, conclusion, inductive, reasoning, builds, knowledge, not, from, established, truth, but, from, a, body, of, observations, it, requires, stringent, scepticism, regarding, observed, phenomena, because, cognitive, assumptions, can, distort, the, interpretation, of, initial, perceptions, an, example, for, how, inductive, and, deductive, reasoning, works, can, be, found, in, the, history, of, gravitational, theory, it, took, thousands, of, years, of, measurements, from, the, chaldean, indian, persian, greek, arabic, and, european, astronomers, to, fully, record, the, motion, of, planet, earth, kepler, and, others, were, then, able, to, build, their, early, theories, by, generalizing, the, collected, data, inductively, and, newton, was, able, to, unify, prior, theory, and, measurements, into, the, consequences, of, his, laws, of, motion, in, 1727, another, common, example, of, inductive, reasoning, is, the, observation, of, a, counterexample, to, current, theory, inducing, the, need, for, new, ideas, le, verrier, in, 1859, pointed, out, problems, with, the, perihelion, of, mercury, that, showed, newton, s, theory, to, be, at, least, incomplete, the, observed, difference, of, mercury, s, precession, between, newtonian, theory, and, observation, was, one, of, the, things, that, occurred, to, einstein, as, a, possible, early, test, of, his, theory, of, relativity, his, relativistic, calculations, matched, observation, much, more, closely, than, newtonian, theory, did, though, today, s, standard, model, of, physics, suggests, that, we, still, do, not, know, at, least, some, of, the, concepts, surrounding, einstein, s, theory, it, holds, to, this, day, and, is, being, built, on, deductively, a, theory, being, assumed, as, true, and, subsequently, built, on, is, a, common, example, of, deductive, reasoning, theory, building, on, einstein, s, achievement, can, simply, state, that, we, have, shown, that, this, case, fulfils, the, conditions, under, which, general, special, relativity, applies, therefore, its, conclusions, apply, also, if, it, was, properly, shown, that, this, case, fulfils, the, conditions, the, conclusion, follows, an, extension, of, this, is, the, assumption, of, a, solution, to, an, open, problem, this, weaker, kind, of, deductive, reasoning, will, get, used, in, current, research, when, multiple, scientists, or, even, teams, of, researchers, are, all, gradually, solving, specific, cases, in, working, towards, proving, a, larger, theory, this, often, sees, hypotheses, being, revised, again, and, again, as, new, proof, emerges, this, way, of, presenting, inductive, and, deductive, reasoning, shows, part, of, why, science, is, often, presented, as, being, a, cycle, of, iteration, it, is, important, to, keep, in, mind, that, that, cycle, s, foundations, lie, in, reasoning, and, not, wholly, in, the, following, of, procedure, claims, of, scientific, truth, can, be, opposed, in, three, ways, by, falsifying, them, by, questioning, their, certainty, or, by, asserting, the, claim, itself, to, be, incoherent, incoherence, here, means, internal, errors, in, logic, like, stating, opposites, to, be, true, falsification, is, what, popper, would, have, called, the, honest, work, of, conjecture, and, refutation, certainty, perhaps, is, where, difficulties, in, telling, truths, from, non, truths, arise, most, easily, measurements, in, scientific, work, are, usually, accompanied, by, estimates, of, their, uncertainty, the, uncertainty, is, often, estimated, by, making, repeated, measurements, of, the, desired, quantity, uncertainties, may, also, be, calculated, by, consideration, of, the, uncertainties, of, the, individual, underlying, quantities, used, counts, of, things, such, as, the, number, of, people, in, a, nation, at, a, particular, time, may, also, have, an, uncertainty, due, to, data, collection, limitations, or, counts, may, represent, a, sample, of, desired, quantities, with, an, uncertainty, that, depends, upon, the, sampling, method, used, and, the, number, of, samples, taken, in, the, case, of, measurement, imprecision, there, will, simply, be, a, probable, deviation, expressing, itself, in, a, study, s, conclusions, statistics, are, different, inductive, statistical, generalisation, will, take, sample, data, and, extrapolate, more, general, conclusions, which, has, to, be, justified, and, scrutinised, it, can, even, be, said, that, statistical, models, are, only, ever, useful, but, never, a, complete, representation, of, circumstances, in, statistical, analysis, expected, and, unexpected, bias, is, a, large, factor, research, questions, the, collection, of, data, or, the, interpretation, of, results, all, are, subject, to, larger, amounts, of, scrutiny, than, in, comfortably, logical, environments, statistical, models, go, through, a, process, for, validation, for, which, one, could, even, say, that, awareness, of, potential, biases, is, more, important, than, the, hard, logic, errors, in, logic, are, easier, to, find, in, peer, review, after, all, more, general, claims, to, rational, knowledge, and, especially, statistics, have, to, be, put, into, their, appropriate, context, simple, statements, such, as, 9, out, of, 10, doctors, recommend, are, therefore, of, unknown, quality, because, they, do, not, justify, their, methodology, lack, of, familiarity, with, statistical, methodologies, can, result, in, erroneous, conclusions, foregoing, the, easy, example, multiple, probabilities, interacting, is, where, for, example, medical, professionals, have, shown, a, lack, of, proper, understanding, bayes, theorem, is, the, mathematical, principle, lining, out, how, standing, probabilities, are, adjusted, given, new, information, the, boy, or, girl, paradox, is, a, common, example, in, knowledge, representation, bayesian, estimation, of, mutual, information, between, random, variables, is, a, way, to, measure, dependence, independence, or, interdependence, of, the, information, under, scrutiny, beyond, commonly, associated, survey, methodology, of, field, research, the, concept, together, with, probabilistic, reasoning, is, used, to, advance, fields, of, science, where, research, objects, have, no, definitive, states, of, being, for, example, in, statistical, mechanics, the, hypothetico, deductive, model, or, hypothesis, testing, method, or, traditional, scientific, method, is, as, the, name, implies, based, on, the, formation, of, hypotheses, and, their, testing, via, deductive, reasoning, a, hypothesis, stating, implications, often, called, predictions, that, are, falsifiable, via, experiment, is, of, central, importance, here, as, not, the, hypothesis, but, its, implications, are, what, is, tested, basically, scientists, will, look, at, the, hypothetical, consequences, a, potential, theory, holds, and, prove, or, disprove, those, instead, of, the, theory, itself, if, an, experimental, test, of, those, hypothetical, consequences, shows, them, to, be, false, it, follows, logically, that, the, part, of, the, theory, that, implied, them, was, false, also, if, they, show, as, true, however, it, does, not, prove, the, theory, definitively, the, logic, of, this, testing, is, what, affords, this, method, of, inquiry, to, be, reasoned, deductively, the, formulated, hypothesis, is, assumed, to, be, true, and, from, that, true, statement, implications, are, inferred, if, the, following, tests, show, the, implications, to, be, false, it, follows, that, the, hypothesis, was, false, also, if, test, show, the, implications, to, be, true, new, insights, will, be, gained, it, is, important, to, be, aware, that, a, positive, test, here, will, at, best, strongly, imply, but, not, definitively, prove, the, tested, hypothesis, as, deductive, inference, a, b, is, not, equivalent, like, that, only, b, a, is, valid, logic, their, positive, outcomes, however, as, hempel, put, it, provide, at, least, some, support, some, corroboration, or, confirmation, for, it, this, is, why, popper, insisted, on, fielded, hypotheses, to, be, falsifieable, as, successful, tests, imply, very, little, otherwise, as, gillies, put, it, successful, theories, are, those, that, survive, elimination, through, falsification, deductive, reasoning, in, this, mode, of, inquiry, will, sometimes, be, replaced, by, abductive, reasoning, the, search, for, the, most, plausible, explanation, via, logical, inference, for, example, in, biology, where, general, laws, are, few, as, valid, deductions, rely, on, solid, presuppositions, the, inductivist, approach, to, deriving, scientific, truth, first, rose, to, prominence, with, francis, bacon, and, particularly, with, isaac, newton, and, those, who, followed, him, after, the, establishment, of, the, hd, method, it, was, often, put, aside, as, something, of, a, fishing, expedition, though, it, is, still, valid, to, some, degree, but, today, s, inductive, method, is, often, far, removed, from, the, historic, approach, the, scale, of, the, data, collected, lending, new, effectiveness, to, the, method, it, is, most, associated, with, data, mining, projects, or, large, scale, observation, projects, in, both, these, cases, it, is, often, not, at, all, clear, what, the, results, of, proposed, experiments, will, be, and, thus, knowledge, will, arise, after, the, collection, of, data, through, inductive, reasoning, where, the, traditional, method, of, inquiry, does, both, the, inductive, approach, usually, formulates, only, a, research, question, not, a, hypothesis, following, the, initial, question, instead, a, suitable, high, throughput, method, of, data, collection, is, determined, the, resulting, data, processed, and, cleaned, up, and, conclusions, drawn, after, this, shift, in, focus, elevates, the, data, to, the, supreme, role, of, revealing, novel, insights, by, themselves, the, advantage, the, inductive, method, has, over, methods, formulating, a, hypothesis, that, it, is, essentially, free, of, a, researcher, s, preconceived, notions, regarding, their, subject, on, the, other, hand, inductive, reasoning, is, always, attached, to, a, measure, of, certainty, as, all, inductively, reasoned, conclusions, are, this, measure, of, certainty, can, reach, quite, high, degrees, though, for, example, in, the, determination, of, large, primes, which, are, used, in, encryption, software, mathematical, modelling, or, allochthonous, reasoning, typically, is, the, formulation, of, a, hypothesis, followed, by, building, mathematical, constructs, that, can, be, tested, in, place, of, conducting, physical, laboratory, experiments, this, approach, has, two, main, factors, simplification, abstraction, and, secondly, a, set, of, correspondence, rules, the, correspondence, rules, lay, out, how, the, constructed, model, will, relate, back, to, reality, how, truth, is, derived, and, the, simplifying, steps, taken, in, the, abstraction, of, the, given, system, are, to, reduce, factors, that, do, not, bear, relevance, and, thereby, reduce, unexpected, errors, these, steps, can, also, help, the, researcher, in, understanding, the, important, factors, of, the, system, how, far, parsimony, can, be, taken, until, the, system, becomes, more, and, more, unchangeable, and, thereby, stable, parsimony, and, related, principles, are, further, explored, below, once, this, translation, into, mathematics, is, complete, the, resulting, model, in, place, of, the, corresponding, system, can, be, analysed, through, purely, mathematical, and, computational, means, the, results, of, this, analysis, are, of, course, also, purely, mathematical, in, nature, and, get, translated, back, to, the, system, as, it, exists, in, reality, via, the, previously, determined, correspondence, rules, iteration, following, review, and, interpretation, of, the, findings, the, way, such, models, are, reasoned, will, often, be, mathematically, deductive, but, they, don, t, have, to, be, an, example, here, are, monte, carlo, simulations, these, generate, empirical, data, arbitrarily, and, while, they, may, not, be, able, to, reveal, universal, principles, they, can, nevertheless, be, useful, scientific, inquiry, generally, aims, to, obtain, knowledge, in, the, form, of, testable, explanations, that, scientists, can, use, to, predict, the, results, of, future, experiments, this, allows, scientists, to, gain, a, better, understanding, of, the, topic, under, study, and, later, to, use, that, understanding, to, intervene, in, its, causal, mechanisms, such, as, to, cure, disease, the, better, an, explanation, is, at, making, predictions, the, more, useful, it, frequently, can, be, and, the, more, likely, it, will, continue, to, explain, a, body, of, evidence, better, than, its, alternatives, the, most, successful, explanations, those, that, explain, and, make, accurate, predictions, in, a, wide, range, of, circumstances, are, often, called, scientific, theories, most, experimental, results, do, not, produce, large, changes, in, human, understanding, improvements, in, theoretical, scientific, understanding, typically, result, from, a, gradual, process, of, development, over, time, sometimes, across, different, domains, of, science, scientific, models, vary, in, the, extent, to, which, they, have, been, experimentally, tested, and, for, how, long, and, in, their, acceptance, in, the, scientific, community, in, general, explanations, become, accepted, over, time, as, evidence, accumulates, on, a, given, topic, and, the, explanation, in, question, proves, more, powerful, than, its, alternatives, at, explaining, the, evidence, often, subsequent, researchers, re, formulate, the, explanations, over, time, or, combined, explanations, to, produce, new, explanations, scientific, knowledge, is, closely, tied, to, empirical, findings, and, can, remain, subject, to, falsification, if, new, experimental, observations, are, incompatible, with, what, is, found, that, is, no, theory, can, ever, be, considered, final, since, new, problematic, evidence, might, be, discovered, if, such, evidence, is, found, a, new, theory, may, be, proposed, or, more, commonly, it, is, found, that, modifications, to, the, previous, theory, are, sufficient, to, explain, the, new, evidence, the, strength, of, a, theory, relates, to, how, long, it, has, persisted, without, major, alteration, to, its, core, principles, theories, can, also, become, subsumed, by, other, theories, for, example, newton, s, laws, explained, thousands, of, years, of, scientific, observations, of, the, planets, almost, perfectly, however, these, laws, were, then, determined, to, be, special, cases, of, a, more, general, theory, relativity, which, explained, both, the, previously, unexplained, exceptions, to, newton, s, laws, and, predicted, and, explained, other, observations, such, as, the, deflection, of, light, by, gravity, thus, in, certain, cases, independent, unconnected, scientific, observations, can, be, connected, unified, by, principles, of, increasing, explanatory, power, since, new, theories, might, be, more, comprehensive, than, what, preceded, them, and, thus, be, able, to, explain, more, than, previous, ones, successor, theories, might, be, able, to, meet, a, higher, standard, by, explaining, a, larger, body, of, observations, than, their, predecessors, for, example, the, theory, of, evolution, explains, the, diversity, of, life, on, earth, how, species, adapt, to, their, environments, and, many, other, patterns, observed, in, the, natural, world, its, most, recent, major, modification, was, unification, with, genetics, to, form, the, modern, evolutionary, synthesis, in, subsequent, modifications, it, has, also, subsumed, aspects, of, many, other, fields, such, as, biochemistry, and, molecular, biology, during, the, course, of, history, one, theory, has, succeeded, another, and, some, have, suggested, further, work, while, others, have, seemed, content, just, to, explain, the, phenomena, the, reasons, why, one, theory, has, replaced, another, are, not, always, obvious, or, simple, the, philosophy, of, science, includes, the, question, what, criteria, are, satisfied, by, a, good, theory, this, question, has, a, long, history, and, many, scientists, as, well, as, philosophers, have, considered, it, the, objective, is, to, be, able, to, choose, one, theory, as, preferable, to, another, without, introducing, cognitive, bias, though, different, thinkers, emphasize, different, aspects, a, good, theory, in, trying, to, look, for, such, theories, scientists, will, given, a, lack, of, guidance, by, empirical, evidence, try, to, adhere, to, the, goal, here, is, to, make, the, choice, between, theories, less, arbitrary, nonetheless, these, criteria, contain, subjective, elements, and, should, be, considered, heuristics, rather, than, a, definitive, also, criteria, such, as, these, do, not, necessarily, decide, between, alternative, theories, quoting, bird, cannot, determine, scientific, choice, first, which, features, of, a, theory, satisfy, these, criteria, may, be, disputable, e, g, does, simplicity, concern, the, ontological, commitments, of, a, theory, or, its, mathematical, form, secondly, these, criteria, are, imprecise, and, so, there, is, room, for, disagreement, about, the, degree, to, which, they, hold, thirdly, there, can, be, disagreement, about, how, they, are, to, be, weighted, relative, to, one, another, especially, when, they, conflict, it, also, is, debatable, whether, existing, scientific, theories, satisfy, all, these, criteria, which, may, represent, goals, not, yet, achieved, for, example, explanatory, power, over, all, existing, observations, is, satisfied, by, no, one, theory, at, the, moment, the, desiderata, of, a, good, theory, have, been, debated, for, centuries, going, back, perhaps, even, earlier, than, occam, s, razor, which, is, often, taken, as, an, attribute, of, a, good, theory, science, tries, to, be, simple, when, gathered, data, supports, multiple, explanations, the, most, simple, explanation, for, phenomena, or, the, most, simple, formation, of, a, theory, is, recommended, by, the, principle, of, parsimony, scientists, go, as, far, as, to, call, simple, proofs, of, complex, statements, beautiful, we, are, to, admit, no, more, causes, of, natural, things, than, such, as, are, both, true, and, sufficient, to, explain, their, appearances, the, concept, of, parsimony, should, not, be, held, to, imply, complete, frugality, in, the, pursuit, of, scientific, truth, the, general, process, starts, at, the, opposite, end, of, there, being, a, vast, number, of, potential, explanations, and, general, disorder, an, example, can, be, seen, in, paul, krugman, s, process, who, makes, explicit, to, dare, to, be, silly, he, writes, that, in, his, work, on, new, theories, of, international, trade, he, reviewed, prior, work, with, an, open, frame, of, mind, and, broadened, his, initial, viewpoint, even, in, unlikely, directions, once, he, had, a, sufficient, body, of, ideas, he, would, try, to, simplify, and, thus, find, what, worked, among, what, did, not, specific, to, krugman, here, was, to, question, the, question, he, recognised, that, prior, work, had, applied, erroneous, models, to, already, present, evidence, commenting, that, intelligent, commentary, was, ignored, thus, touching, on, the, need, to, bridge, the, common, bias, against, other, circles, of, thought, occam, s, razor, might, fall, under, the, heading, of, simple, elegance, but, it, is, arguable, that, parsimony, and, elegance, pull, in, different, directions, introducing, additional, elements, could, simplify, theory, formulation, whereas, simplifying, a, theory, s, ontology, might, lead, to, increased, syntactical, complexity, sometimes, ad, hoc, modifications, of, a, failing, idea, may, also, be, dismissed, as, lacking, formal, elegance, this, appeal, to, what, may, be, called, aesthetic, is, hard, to, characterise, but, essentially, about, a, sort, of, familiarity, though, argument, based, on, elegance, is, contentious, and, over, reliance, on, familiarity, will, breed, stagnation, principles, of, invariance, have, been, a, theme, in, scientific, writing, and, especially, physics, since, at, least, the, early, 20th, century, the, basic, idea, here, is, that, good, structures, to, look, for, are, those, independent, of, perspective, an, idea, that, has, featured, earlier, of, course, for, example, in, mill, s, methods, of, difference, and, agreement, methods, that, would, be, referred, back, to, in, the, context, of, contrast, and, invariance, but, as, tends, to, be, the, case, there, is, a, difference, between, something, being, a, basic, consideration, and, something, being, given, weight, principles, of, invariance, have, only, been, given, weight, in, the, wake, of, einstein, s, theories, of, relativity, which, reduced, everything, to, relations, and, were, thereby, fundamentally, unchangeable, unable, to, be, varied, as, david, deutsch, put, it, in, 2009, the, search, for, hard, to, vary, explanations, is, the, origin, of, all, progress, an, example, here, can, be, found, in, one, of, einstein, s, thought, experiments, the, one, of, a, lab, suspended, in, empty, space, is, an, example, of, a, useful, invariant, observation, he, imagined, the, absence, of, gravity, and, an, experimenter, free, floating, in, the, lab, if, now, an, entity, pulls, the, lab, upwards, accelerating, uniformly, the, experimenter, would, perceive, the, resulting, force, as, gravity, the, entity, however, would, feel, the, work, needed, to, accelerate, the, lab, continuously, through, this, experiment, einstein, was, able, to, equate, gravitational, and, inertial, mass, something, unexplained, by, newton, s, laws, and, an, early, but, powerful, argument, for, a, generalised, postulate, of, relativity, the, feature, which, suggests, reality, is, always, some, kind, of, invariance, of, a, structure, independent, of, the, aspect, the, projection, the, discussion, on, invariance, in, physics, is, often, had, in, the, more, specific, context, of, symmetry, the, einstein, example, above, in, the, parlance, of, mill, would, be, an, agreement, between, two, values, in, the, context, of, invariance, it, is, a, variable, that, remains, unchanged, through, some, kind, of, transformation, or, change, in, perspective, and, discussion, focused, on, symmetry, would, view, the, two, perspectives, as, systems, that, share, a, relevant, aspect, and, are, therefore, symmetrical, related, principles, here, are, falsifiability, and, testability, the, opposite, of, something, being, hard, to, vary, are, theories, that, resist, falsification, a, frustration, that, was, expressed, colourfully, by, wolfgang, pauli, as, them, being, not, even, wrong, the, importance, of, scientific, theories, to, be, falsifiable, finds, especial, emphasis, in, the, philosophy, of, karl, popper, the, broader, view, here, is, testability, since, it, includes, the, former, and, allows, for, additional, practical, considerations, philosophy, of, science, looks, at, the, underpinning, logic, of, the, scientific, method, at, what, separates, science, from, non, science, and, the, ethic, that, is, implicit, in, science, there, are, basic, assumptions, derived, from, philosophy, by, at, least, one, prominent, scientist, that, form, the, base, of, the, scientific, method, namely, that, reality, is, objective, and, consistent, that, humans, have, the, capacity, to, perceive, reality, accurately, and, that, rational, explanations, exist, for, elements, of, the, real, world, these, assumptions, from, methodological, naturalism, form, a, basis, on, which, science, may, be, grounded, logical, positivist, empiricist, falsificationist, and, other, theories, have, criticized, these, assumptions, and, given, alternative, accounts, of, the, logic, of, science, but, each, has, also, itself, been, criticized, there, are, several, kinds, of, modern, philosophical, conceptualizations, and, attempts, at, definitions, of, the, method, of, science, the, one, attempted, by, the, unificationists, who, argue, for, the, existence, of, a, unified, definition, that, is, useful, or, at, least, works, in, every, context, of, science, the, pluralists, arguing, degrees, of, science, being, too, fractured, for, a, universal, definition, of, its, method, to, by, useful, and, those, who, argue, that, the, very, attempt, at, definition, is, already, detrimental, to, the, free, flow, of, ideas, additionally, there, have, been, views, on, the, social, framework, in, which, science, is, done, and, the, impact, of, the, sciences, social, envrionment, on, research, also, there, is, scientific, method, as, popularised, by, dewey, in, how, we, think, 1910, and, karl, pearson, in, grammar, of, science, 1892, as, used, in, fairly, uncritical, manner, in, education, scientific, pluralism, is, a, position, within, the, philosophy, of, science, that, rejects, various, proposed, unities, of, scientific, method, and, subject, matter, scientific, pluralists, hold, that, science, is, not, unified, in, one, or, more, of, the, following, ways, the, metaphysics, of, its, subject, matter, the, epistemology, of, scientific, knowledge, or, the, research, methods, and, models, that, should, be, used, some, pluralists, believe, that, pluralism, is, necessary, due, to, the, nature, of, science, others, say, that, since, scientific, disciplines, already, vary, in, practice, there, is, no, reason, to, believe, this, variation, is, wrong, until, a, specific, unification, is, empirically, proven, finally, some, hold, that, pluralism, should, be, allowed, for, normative, reasons, even, if, unity, were, possible, in, theory, unificationism, in, science, was, a, central, tenet, of, logical, positivism, different, logical, positivists, construed, this, doctrine, in, several, different, ways, e, g, as, a, reductionist, thesis, that, the, objects, investigated, by, the, special, sciences, reduce, to, the, objects, of, a, common, putatively, more, basic, domain, of, science, usually, thought, to, be, physics, as, the, thesis, that, all, theories, and, results, of, the, various, sciences, can, or, ought, to, be, expressed, in, a, common, language, or, universal, slang, or, as, the, thesis, that, all, the, special, sciences, share, a, common, scientific, method, development, of, the, idea, has, been, troubled, by, accelerated, advancement, in, technology, that, has, opened, up, many, new, ways, to, look, at, the, world, the, fact, that, the, standards, of, scientific, success, shift, with, time, does, not, only, make, the, philosophy, of, science, difficult, it, also, raises, problems, for, the, public, understanding, of, science, we, do, not, have, a, fixed, scientific, method, to, rally, around, and, defend, paul, feyerabend, examined, the, history, of, science, and, was, led, to, deny, that, science, is, genuinely, a, methodological, process, in, his, book, against, method, he, argued, that, no, description, of, scientific, method, could, possibly, be, broad, enough, to, include, all, the, approaches, and, methods, used, by, scientists, and, that, there, are, no, useful, and, exception, free, methodological, rules, governing, the, progress, of, science, in, essence, he, said, that, for, any, specific, method, or, norm, of, science, one, can, find, a, historic, episode, where, violating, it, has, contributed, to, the, progress, of, science, he, jokingly, suggested, that, if, believers, in, the, scientific, method, wish, to, express, a, single, universally, valid, rule, it, should, be, anything, goes, as, has, been, argued, before, him, however, this, is, uneconomic, problem, solvers, and, researchers, are, to, be, prudent, with, their, resources, during, their, inquiry, a, more, general, inference, against, formalised, method, has, been, found, through, research, involving, interviews, with, scientists, regarding, their, conception, of, method, this, research, indicated, that, scientists, frequently, encounter, difficulty, in, determining, whether, the, available, evidence, supports, their, hypotheses, this, reveals, that, there, are, no, straightforward, mappings, between, overarching, methodological, concepts, and, precise, strategies, to, direct, the, conduct, of, research, in, science, education, the, idea, of, a, general, and, universal, scientific, method, has, been, notably, influential, and, numerous, studies, in, the, us, have, shown, that, this, framing, of, method, often, forms, part, of, both, students, and, teachers, conception, of, science, this, convention, of, traditional, education, has, been, argued, against, by, scientists, as, there, is, a, consensus, that, educations, sequential, elements, and, unified, view, of, scientific, method, do, not, reflect, how, scientists, actually, work, how, the, sciences, make, knowledge, has, been, taught, in, the, context, of, the, scientific, method, singular, since, the, early, 20th, century, various, systems, of, education, including, but, not, limited, to, the, us, have, taught, the, method, of, science, as, a, process, or, procedure, structured, as, a, definitive, series, of, steps, observation, hypothesis, prediction, experiment, this, version, of, the, method, of, science, has, been, a, long, established, standard, in, primary, and, secondary, education, as, well, as, the, biomedical, sciences, it, has, long, been, held, to, be, an, inaccurate, idealisation, of, how, some, scientific, inquiries, are, structured, the, taught, presentation, of, science, had, to, defend, demerits, such, as, the, scientific, method, no, longer, features, in, the, standards, for, us, education, of, 2013, ngss, that, replaced, those, of, 1996, nrc, they, too, influenced, international, science, education, and, the, standards, measured, for, have, shifted, since, from, the, singular, hypothesis, testing, method, to, a, broader, conception, of, scientific, methods, these, scientific, methods, which, are, rooted, in, scientific, practices, and, not, epistemology, are, described, as, the, 3, dimensions, of, scientific, and, engineering, practices, crosscutting, concepts, interdisciplinary, ideas, and, disciplinary, core, ideas, the, scientific, method, as, a, result, of, simplified, and, universal, explanations, is, often, held, to, have, reached, a, kind, of, mythological, status, as, a, tool, for, communication, or, at, best, an, idealisation, education, s, approach, was, heavily, influenced, by, john, dewey, s, how, we, think, 1910, van, der, ploeg, 2016, indicated, that, dewey, s, views, on, education, had, long, been, used, to, further, an, idea, of, citizen, education, removed, from, sound, education, claiming, that, references, to, dewey, in, such, arguments, were, undue, interpretations, of, dewey, the, sociology, of, knowledge, is, a, concept, in, the, discussion, around, scientific, method, claiming, the, underlying, method, of, science, to, be, sociological, king, explains, that, sociology, distinguishes, here, between, the, system, of, ideas, that, govern, the, sciences, through, an, inner, logic, and, the, social, system, in, which, those, ideas, arise, a, perhaps, accessible, lead, into, what, is, claimed, is, fleck, s, thought, echoed, in, kuhn, s, concept, of, normal, science, according, to, fleck, scientists, work, is, based, on, a, thought, style, that, cannot, be, rationally, reconstructed, it, gets, instilled, through, the, experience, of, learning, and, science, is, then, advanced, based, on, a, tradition, of, shared, assumptions, held, by, what, he, called, thought, collectives, fleck, also, claims, this, phenomenon, to, be, largely, invisible, to, members, of, the, group, comparably, following, the, field, research, in, an, academic, scientific, laboratory, by, latour, and, woolgar, karin, knorr, cetina, has, conducted, a, comparative, study, of, two, scientific, fields, namely, high, energy, physics, and, molecular, biology, to, conclude, that, the, epistemic, practices, and, reasonings, within, both, scientific, communities, are, different, enough, to, introduce, the, concept, of, epistemic, cultures, in, contradiction, with, the, idea, that, a, so, called, scientific, method, is, unique, and, a, unifying, concept, on, the, idea, of, fleck, s, thought, collectives, sociologists, built, the, concept, of, situated, cognition, that, the, perspective, of, the, researcher, fundamentally, affects, their, work, and, too, more, radical, views, norwood, russell, hanson, alongside, thomas, kuhn, and, paul, feyerabend, extensively, explored, the, theory, laden, nature, of, observation, in, science, hanson, introduced, the, concept, in, 1958, emphasizing, that, observation, is, influenced, by, the, observer, s, conceptual, framework, he, used, the, concept, of, gestalt, to, show, how, preconceptions, can, affect, both, observation, and, description, and, illustrated, this, with, examples, like, the, initial, rejection, of, golgi, bodies, as, an, artefact, of, staining, technique, and, the, differing, interpretations, of, the, same, sunrise, by, tycho, brahe, and, johannes, kepler, intersubjectivity, led, to, different, conclusions, kuhn, and, feyerabend, acknowledged, hanson, s, pioneering, work, although, feyerabend, s, views, on, methodological, pluralism, were, more, radical, criticisms, like, those, from, kuhn, and, feyerabend, prompted, discussions, leading, to, the, development, of, the, strong, programme, a, sociological, approach, that, seeks, to, explain, scientific, knowledge, without, recourse, to, the, truth, or, validity, of, scientific, theories, it, examines, how, scientific, beliefs, are, shaped, by, social, factors, such, as, power, ideology, and, interests, the, postmodernist, critiques, of, science, have, themselves, been, the, subject, of, intense, controversy, this, ongoing, debate, known, as, the, science, wars, is, the, result, of, conflicting, values, and, assumptions, between, postmodernist, and, realist, perspectives, postmodernists, argue, that, scientific, knowledge, is, merely, a, discourse, devoid, of, any, claim, to, fundamental, truth, in, contrast, realists, within, the, scientific, community, maintain, that, science, uncovers, real, and, fundamental, truths, about, reality, many, books, have, been, written, by, scientists, which, take, on, this, problem, and, challenge, the, assertions, of, the, postmodernists, while, defending, science, as, a, legitimate, way, of, deriving, truth, somewhere, between, 33, and, 50, of, all, scientific, discoveries, are, estimated, to, have, been, stumbled, upon, rather, than, sought, out, this, may, explain, why, scientists, so, often, express, that, they, were, lucky, louis, pasteur, is, credited, with, the, famous, saying, that, luck, favours, the, prepared, mind, but, some, psychologists, have, begun, to, study, what, it, means, to, be, prepared, for, luck, in, the, scientific, context, research, is, showing, that, scientists, are, taught, various, heuristics, that, tend, to, harness, chance, and, the, unexpected, this, is, what, nassim, nicholas, taleb, calls, anti, fragility, while, some, systems, of, investigation, are, fragile, in, the, face, of, human, error, human, bias, and, randomness, the, scientific, method, is, more, than, resistant, or, tough, it, actually, benefits, from, such, randomness, in, many, ways, it, is, anti, fragile, taleb, believes, that, the, more, anti, fragile, the, system, the, more, it, will, flourish, in, the, real, world, psychologist, kevin, dunbar, says, the, process, of, discovery, often, starts, with, researchers, finding, bugs, in, their, experiments, these, unexpected, results, lead, researchers, to, try, to, fix, what, they, think, is, an, error, in, their, method, eventually, the, researcher, decides, the, error, is, too, persistent, and, systematic, to, be, a, coincidence, the, highly, controlled, cautious, and, curious, aspects, of, the, scientific, method, are, thus, what, make, it, well, suited, for, identifying, such, persistent, systematic, errors, at, this, point, the, researcher, will, begin, to, think, of, theoretical, explanations, for, the, error, often, seeking, the, help, of, colleagues, across, different, domains, of, expertise, when, the, scientific, method, employs, statistics, as, a, key, part, of, its, arsenal, there, are, mathematical, and, practical, issues, that, can, have, a, deleterious, effect, on, the, reliability, of, the, output, of, scientific, methods, this, is, described, in, a, popular, 2005, scientific, paper, why, most, published, research, findings, are, false, by, john, ioannidis, which, is, considered, foundational, to, the, field, of, metascience, much, research, in, metascience, seeks, to, identify, poor, use, of, statistics, and, improve, its, use, an, example, being, the, misuse, of, p, values, the, particular, points, raised, are, statistical, the, smaller, the, studies, conducted, in, a, scientific, field, the, less, likely, the, research, findings, are, to, be, true, and, the, greater, the, flexibility, in, designs, definitions, outcomes, and, analytical, modes, in, a, scientific, field, the, less, likely, the, research, findings, are, to, be, true, and, economical, the, greater, the, financial, and, other, interests, and, prejudices, in, a, scientific, field, the, less, likely, the, research, findings, are, to, be, true, and, the, hotter, a, scientific, field, with, more, scientific, teams, involved, the, less, likely, the, research, findings, are, to, be, true, hence, most, research, findings, are, false, for, most, research, designs, and, for, most, fields, and, as, shown, the, majority, of, modern, biomedical, research, is, operating, in, areas, with, very, low, pre, and, poststudy, probability, for, true, findings, however, nevertheless, most, new, discoveries, will, continue, to, stem, from, hypothesis, generating, research, with, low, or, very, low, pre, study, odds, which, means, that, new, discoveries, will, come, from, research, that, when, that, research, started, had, low, or, very, low, odds, a, low, or, very, low, chance, of, succeeding, hence, if, the, scientific, method, is, used, to, expand, the, frontiers, of, knowledge, research, into, areas, that, are, outside, the, mainstream, will, yield, the, newest, discoveries, science, applied, to, complex, systems, can, involve, elements, such, as, transdisciplinarity, systems, theory, control, theory, and, scientific, modelling, in, general, the, scientific, method, may, be, difficult, to, apply, stringently, to, diverse, interconnected, systems, and, large, data, sets, in, particular, practices, used, within, big, data, such, as, predictive, analytics, may, be, considered, to, be, at, odds, with, the, scientific, method, as, some, of, the, data, may, have, been, stripped, of, the, parameters, which, might, be, material, in, alternative, hypotheses, for, an, explanation, thus, the, stripped, data, would, only, serve, to, support, the, null, hypothesis, in, the, predictive, analytics, application, fleck, 1979, pp, 38, 50, notes, a, scientific, discovery, remains, incomplete, without, considerations, of, the, social, practices, that, condition, it, science, is, the, process, of, gathering, comparing, and, evaluating, proposed, models, against, observables, a, model, can, be, a, simulation, mathematical, or, chemical, formula, or, set, of, proposed, steps, science, is, like, mathematics, in, that, researchers, in, both, disciplines, try, to, distinguish, what, is, known, from, what, is, unknown, at, each, stage, of, discovery, models, in, both, science, and, mathematics, need, to, be, internally, consistent, and, also, ought, to, be, falsifiable, capable, of, disproof, in, mathematics, a, statement, need, not, yet, be, proved, at, such, a, stage, that, statement, would, be, called, a, conjecture, mathematical, work, and, scientific, work, can, inspire, each, other, for, example, the, technical, concept, of, time, arose, in, science, and, timelessness, was, a, hallmark, of, a, mathematical, topic, but, today, the, poincar, conjecture, has, been, proved, using, time, as, a, mathematical, concept, in, which, objects, can, flow, see, ricci, flow, nevertheless, the, connection, between, mathematics, and, reality, and, so, science, to, the, extent, it, describes, reality, remains, obscure, eugene, wigner, s, paper, the, unreasonable, effectiveness, of, mathematics, in, the, natural, sciences, is, a, very, well, known, account, of, the, issue, from, a, nobel, prize, winning, physicist, in, fact, some, observers, including, some, well, known, mathematicians, such, as, gregory, chaitin, and, others, such, as, lakoff, and, n, ez, have, suggested, that, mathematics, is, the, result, of, practitioner, bias, and, human, limitation, including, cultural, ones, somewhat, like, the, post, modernist, view, of, science, george, p, lya, s, work, on, problem, solving, the, construction, of, mathematical, proofs, and, heuristic, show, that, the, mathematical, method, and, the, scientific, method, differ, in, detail, while, nevertheless, resembling, each, other, in, using, iterative, or, recursive, steps, in, p, lya, s, view, understanding, involves, restating, unfamiliar, definitions, in, your, own, words, resorting, to, geometrical, figures, and, questioning, what, we, know, and, do, not, know, already, analysis, which, p, lya, takes, from, pappus, involves, free, and, heuristic, construction, of, plausible, arguments, working, backward, from, the, goal, and, devising, a, plan, for, constructing, the, proof, synthesis, is, the, strict, euclidean, exposition, of, step, by, step, details, of, the, proof, review, involves, reconsidering, and, re, examining, the, result, and, the, path, taken, to, it, building, on, p, lya, s, work, imre, lakatos, argued, that, mathematicians, actually, use, contradiction, criticism, and, revision, as, principles, for, improving, their, work, in, like, manner, to, science, where, truth, is, sought, but, certainty, is, not, found, in, proofs, and, refutations, what, lakatos, tried, to, establish, was, that, no, theorem, of, informal, mathematics, is, final, or, perfect, this, means, that, in, non, axiomatic, mathematics, we, should, not, think, that, a, theorem, is, ultimately, true, only, that, no, counterexample, has, yet, been, found, once, a, counterexample, i, e, an, entity, contradicting, not, explained, by, the, theorem, is, found, we, adjust, the, theorem, possibly, extending, the, domain, of, its, validity, this, is, a, continuous, way, our, knowledge, accumulates, through, the, logic, and, process, of, proofs, and, refutations, however, if, axioms, are, given, for, a, branch, of, mathematics, this, creates, a, logical, system, wittgenstein, 1921, tractatus, logico, philosophicus, 5, 13, lakatos, claimed, that, proofs, from, such, a, system, were, tautological, i, e, internally, logically, true, by, rewriting, forms, as, shown, by, poincar, who, demonstrated, the, technique, of, transforming, tautologically, true, forms, viz, the, euler, characteristic, into, or, out, of, forms, from, homology, or, more, abstractly, from, homological, algebra, lakatos, proposed, an, account, of, mathematical, knowledge, based, on, polya, s, idea, of, heuristics, in, proofs, and, refutations, lakatos, gave, several, basic, rules, for, finding, proofs, and, counterexamples, to, conjectures, he, thought, that, mathematical, thought, experiments, are, a, valid, way, to, discover, mathematical, conjectures, and, proofs, gauss, when, asked, how, he, came, about, his, theorems, once, replied, durch, planm, ssiges, tattonieren, through, systematic, palpable, experimentation, the, fact, that, the, standards, of, scientific, success, shift, with, time, does, not, only, make, the, philosophy, of, science, difficult, it, also, raises, problems, for, the, public, understanding, of, science, we, do, not, have, a, fixed, scientific, method, to, rally, around, and, defend
