a, dust, storm, also, called, a, sandstorm, is, a, meteorological, phenomenon, common, in, arid, and, semi, arid, regions, dust, storms, arise, when, a, gust, front, or, other, strong, wind, blows, loose, sand, and, dirt, from, a, dry, surface, fine, particles, are, transported, by, saltation, and, suspension, a, process, that, moves, soil, from, one, place, and, deposits, it, in, another, the, arid, regions, of, north, africa, the, middle, east, central, asia, and, china, are, the, main, terrestrial, sources, of, airborne, dust, it, has, been, argued, that, poor, management, of, earth, s, drylands, such, as, neglecting, the, fallow, system, are, increasing, the, size, and, frequency, of, dust, storms, from, desert, margins, and, changing, both, the, local, and, global, climate, as, well, as, impacting, local, economies, the, term, sandstorm, is, used, most, often, in, the, context, of, desert, dust, storms, especially, in, the, sahara, desert, or, places, where, sand, is, a, more, prevalent, soil, type, than, dirt, or, rock, when, in, addition, to, fine, particles, obscuring, visibility, a, considerable, amount, of, larger, sand, particles, are, blown, closer, to, the, surface, the, term, dust, storm, is, more, likely, to, be, used, when, finer, particles, are, blown, long, distances, especially, when, the, dust, storm, affects, urban, areas, as, the, force, of, dust, passing, over, loosely, held, particles, increases, particles, of, sand, first, start, to, vibrate, then, to, move, across, the, surface, in, a, process, called, saltation, as, they, repeatedly, strike, the, ground, they, loosen, and, break, off, smaller, particles, of, dust, which, then, begin, to, travel, in, suspension, at, wind, speeds, above, that, which, causes, the, smallest, to, suspend, there, will, be, a, population, of, dust, grains, moving, by, a, range, of, mechanisms, suspension, saltation, and, creep, a, study, from, 2008, finds, that, the, initial, saltation, of, sand, particles, induces, a, static, electric, field, by, friction, saltating, sand, acquires, a, negative, charge, relative, to, the, ground, which, in, turn, loosens, more, sand, particles, which, then, begin, saltating, this, process, has, been, found, to, double, the, number, of, particles, predicted, by, previous, theories, particles, become, loosely, held, mainly, due, to, a, prolonged, drought, or, arid, conditions, and, high, wind, speeds, gust, fronts, may, be, produced, by, the, outflow, of, rain, cooled, air, from, an, intense, thunderstorm, or, the, wind, gusts, may, be, produced, by, a, dry, cold, front, that, is, a, cold, front, that, is, moving, into, a, dry, air, mass, and, is, producing, no, precipitation, the, type, of, dust, storm, which, was, common, during, the, dust, bowl, years, in, the, u, s, following, the, passage, of, a, dry, cold, front, convective, instability, resulting, from, cooler, air, riding, over, heated, ground, can, maintain, the, dust, storm, initiated, at, the, front, in, desert, areas, dust, and, sand, storms, are, most, commonly, caused, by, either, thunderstorm, outflows, or, by, strong, pressure, gradients, which, cause, an, increase, in, wind, velocity, over, a, wide, area, the, vertical, extent, of, the, dust, or, sand, that, is, raised, is, largely, determined, by, the, stability, of, the, atmosphere, above, the, ground, as, well, as, by, the, weight, of, the, particulates, in, some, cases, dust, and, sand, may, be, confined, to, a, relatively, shallow, layer, by, a, low, lying, temperature, inversion, in, other, instances, dust, but, not, sand, may, be, lifted, as, high, as, 6, 000, m, 20, 000, ft, dust, storms, are, a, major, health, hazard, drought, and, wind, contribute, to, the, emergence, of, dust, storms, as, do, poor, farming, and, grazing, practices, by, exposing, the, dust, and, sand, to, the, wind, wildfires, can, lead, to, dust, storms, as, well, one, poor, farming, practice, which, contributes, to, dust, storms, is, dryland, farming, particularly, poor, dryland, farming, techniques, are, intensive, tillage, or, not, having, established, crops, or, cover, crops, when, storms, strike, at, particularly, vulnerable, times, prior, to, revegetation, in, a, semi, arid, climate, these, practices, increase, susceptibility, to, dust, storms, however, soil, conservation, practices, may, be, implemented, to, control, wind, erosion, a, sandstorm, can, transport, and, carry, large, volumes, of, sand, unexpectedly, dust, storms, can, carry, large, amounts, of, dust, with, the, leading, edge, being, composed, of, a, wall, of, thick, dust, as, much, as, 1, 6, km, 5, 200, ft, high, dust, and, sand, storms, which, come, off, the, sahara, desert, are, locally, known, as, a, simoom, or, simoon, s, m, m, s, m, n, the, haboob, h, b, b, is, a, sandstorm, prevalent, in, the, region, of, sudan, around, khartoum, with, occurrences, being, most, common, in, the, summer, the, sahara, desert, is, a, key, source, of, dust, storms, particularly, the, bod, l, depression, and, an, area, covering, the, confluence, of, mauritania, mali, and, algeria, sahara, dust, is, frequently, emitted, into, the, mediterranean, atmosphere, and, transported, by, the, winds, sometimes, as, far, north, as, central, europe, and, great, britain, saharan, dust, storms, have, increased, approximately, 10, fold, during, the, half, century, since, the, 1950s, causing, topsoil, loss, in, niger, chad, northern, nigeria, and, burkina, faso, in, mauritania, there, were, just, two, dust, storms, a, year, in, the, early, 1960s, there, are, about, 80, a, year, since, 2007, according, to, english, geographer, andrew, goudie, professor, at, the, university, of, oxford, levels, of, saharan, dust, coming, off, the, east, coast, of, africa, in, june, 2007, were, five, times, those, observed, in, june, 2006, and, were, the, highest, observed, since, at, least, 1999, which, may, have, cooled, atlantic, waters, enough, to, slightly, reduce, hurricane, activity, in, late, 2007, dust, storms, have, also, been, shown, to, increase, the, spread, of, disease, across, the, globe, bacteria, and, fungus, spores, in, the, ground, are, blown, into, the, atmosphere, by, the, storms, with, the, minute, particles, and, interact, with, urban, air, pollution, short, term, effects, of, exposure, to, desert, dust, include, immediate, increased, symptoms, and, worsening, of, the, lung, function, in, individuals, with, asthma, increased, mortality, and, morbidity, from, long, transported, dust, from, both, saharan, and, asian, dust, storms, suggesting, that, long, transported, dust, storm, particles, adversely, affects, the, circulatory, system, dust, pneumonia, is, the, result, of, large, amounts, of, dust, being, inhaled, prolonged, and, unprotected, exposure, of, the, respiratory, system, in, a, dust, storm, can, also, cause, silicosis, which, if, left, untreated, will, lead, to, asphyxiation, silicosis, is, an, incurable, condition, that, may, also, lead, to, lung, cancer, there, is, also, the, danger, of, keratoconjunctivitis, sicca, dry, eyes, which, in, severe, cases, without, immediate, and, proper, treatment, can, lead, to, blindness, dust, storms, cause, soil, loss, from, the, drylands, and, worse, they, preferentially, remove, organic, matter, and, the, nutrient, rich, lightest, particles, thereby, reducing, agricultural, productivity, also, the, abrasive, effect, of, the, storm, damages, young, crop, plants, dust, storms, also, reduce, visibility, affecting, aircraft, and, road, transportation, dust, can, also, have, beneficial, effects, where, it, deposits, central, and, south, american, rainforests, get, significant, quantities, of, mineral, nutrients, from, the, sahara, iron, poor, ocean, regions, get, iron, and, dust, in, hawaii, increases, plantain, growth, in, northern, china, as, well, as, the, mid, western, u, s, ancient, dust, storm, deposits, known, as, loess, are, highly, fertile, soils, but, they, are, also, a, significant, source, of, contemporary, dust, storms, when, soil, securing, vegetation, is, disturbed, iranian, cities, existence, are, challenged, by, dust, storms, dust, storms, are, not, limited, to, earth, and, have, also, been, known, to, form, on, mars, these, dust, storms, can, extend, over, larger, areas, than, those, on, earth, sometimes, encircling, the, planet, with, wind, speeds, as, high, as, 25, m, s, 60, mph, however, given, mars, much, lower, atmospheric, pressure, roughly, 1, that, of, earth, s, the, intensity, of, mars, storms, could, never, reach, the, kind, of, hurricane, force, winds, that, are, experienced, on, earth, martian, dust, storms, are, formed, when, solar, heating, warms, the, martian, atmosphere, and, causes, the, air, to, move, lifting, dust, off, the, ground, the, chance, for, storms, is, increased, when, there, are, great, temperature, variations, like, those, seen, at, the, equator, during, the, martian, summer
