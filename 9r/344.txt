lithium, from, ancient, greek, l, thos, stone, symbol, li, and, atomic, number, 3, is, a, soft, silvery, white, alkali, metal, under, standard, conditions, it, is, the, least, dense, metal, and, the, least, dense, solid, element, like, all, alkali, metals, lithium, is, highly, reactive, and, flammable, and, must, be, stored, in, vacuum, inert, atmosphere, or, inert, liquid, such, as, purified, kerosene, or, mineral, oil, it, exhibits, a, metallic, luster, it, corrodes, quickly, in, air, to, a, dull, silvery, gray, then, black, tarnish, it, does, not, occur, freely, in, nature, but, occurs, mainly, as, pegmatitic, minerals, which, were, once, the, main, source, of, lithium, due, to, its, solubility, as, an, ion, it, is, present, in, ocean, water, and, is, commonly, obtained, from, brines, lithium, metal, is, isolated, electrolytically, from, a, mixture, of, lithium, chloride, and, potassium, chloride, the, nucleus, of, the, lithium, atom, verges, on, instability, since, the, two, stable, lithium, isotopes, found, in, nature, have, among, the, lowest, binding, energies, per, nucleon, of, all, stable, nuclides, because, of, its, relative, nuclear, instability, lithium, is, less, common, in, the, solar, system, than, 25, of, the, first, 32, chemical, elements, even, though, its, nuclei, are, very, light, it, is, an, exception, to, the, trend, that, heavier, nuclei, are, less, common, for, related, reasons, lithium, has, important, uses, in, nuclear, physics, the, transmutation, of, lithium, atoms, to, helium, in, 1932, was, the, first, fully, human, made, nuclear, reaction, and, lithium, deuteride, serves, as, a, fusion, fuel, in, staged, thermonuclear, weapons, lithium, and, its, compounds, have, several, industrial, applications, including, heat, resistant, glass, and, ceramics, lithium, grease, lubricants, flux, additives, for, iron, steel, and, aluminium, production, lithium, metal, batteries, and, lithium, ion, batteries, these, uses, consume, more, than, three, quarters, of, lithium, production, lithium, is, present, in, biological, systems, in, trace, amounts, it, has, no, established, metabolic, function, in, humans, lithium, based, drugs, are, useful, as, a, mood, stabilizer, and, antidepressant, in, the, treatment, of, mental, illness, such, as, bipolar, disorder, the, alkali, metals, are, also, called, the, lithium, family, after, its, leading, element, like, the, other, alkali, metals, which, are, sodium, na, potassium, k, rubidium, rb, caesium, cs, and, francium, fr, lithium, has, a, single, valence, electron, that, in, the, presence, of, solvents, is, easily, released, to, form, li, because, of, this, lithium, is, a, good, conductor, of, heat, and, electricity, as, well, as, a, highly, reactive, element, though, it, is, the, least, reactive, of, the, alkali, metals, lithium, s, lower, reactivity, is, due, to, the, proximity, of, its, valence, electron, to, its, nucleus, the, remaining, two, electrons, are, in, the, 1s, orbital, much, lower, in, energy, and, do, not, participate, in, chemical, bonds, molten, lithium, is, significantly, more, reactive, than, its, solid, form, lithium, metal, is, soft, enough, to, be, cut, with, a, knife, it, is, silvery, white, in, air, it, oxidizes, to, lithium, oxide, its, melting, point, of, 180, 50, c, 453, 65, k, 356, 90, f, and, its, boiling, point, of, 1, 342, c, 1, 615, k, 2, 448, f, are, each, the, highest, of, all, the, alkali, metals, while, its, density, of, 0, 534, g, cm, 3, is, the, lowest, lithium, has, a, very, low, density, 0, 534, g, cm, 3, comparable, with, pine, wood, it, is, the, least, dense, of, all, elements, that, are, solids, at, room, temperature, the, next, lightest, solid, element, potassium, at, 0, 862, g, cm, 3, is, more, than, 60, denser, apart, from, helium, and, hydrogen, as, a, solid, it, is, less, dense, than, any, other, element, as, a, liquid, being, only, two, thirds, as, dense, as, liquid, nitrogen, 0, 808, g, cm, 3, lithium, can, float, on, the, lightest, hydrocarbon, oils, and, is, one, of, only, three, metals, that, can, float, on, water, the, other, two, being, sodium, and, potassium, lithium, s, coefficient, of, thermal, expansion, is, twice, that, of, aluminium, and, almost, four, times, that, of, iron, lithium, is, superconductive, below, 400, k, at, standard, pressure, and, at, higher, temperatures, more, than, 9, k, at, very, high, pressures, 20, gpa, at, temperatures, below, 70, k, lithium, like, sodium, undergoes, diffusionless, phase, change, transformations, at, 4, 2, k, it, has, a, rhombohedral, crystal, system, with, a, nine, layer, repeat, spacing, at, higher, temperatures, it, transforms, to, face, centered, cubic, and, then, body, centered, cubic, at, liquid, helium, temperatures, 4, k, the, rhombohedral, structure, is, prevalent, multiple, allotropic, forms, have, been, identified, for, lithium, at, high, pressures, lithium, has, a, mass, specific, heat, capacity, of, 3, 58, kilojoules, per, kilogram, kelvin, the, highest, of, all, solids, because, of, this, lithium, metal, is, often, used, in, coolants, for, heat, transfer, applications, naturally, occurring, lithium, is, composed, of, two, stable, isotopes, 6, li, and, 7, li, the, latter, being, the, more, abundant, 95, 15, natural, abundance, both, natural, isotopes, have, anomalously, low, nuclear, binding, energy, per, nucleon, compared, to, the, neighboring, elements, on, the, periodic, table, helium, and, beryllium, lithium, is, the, only, low, numbered, element, that, can, produce, net, energy, through, nuclear, fission, the, two, lithium, nuclei, have, lower, binding, energies, per, nucleon, than, any, other, stable, nuclides, other, than, hydrogen, 1, deuterium, and, helium, 3, as, a, result, of, this, though, very, light, in, atomic, weight, lithium, is, less, common, in, the, solar, system, than, 25, of, the, first, 32, chemical, elements, seven, radioisotopes, have, been, characterized, the, most, stable, being, 8, li, with, a, half, life, of, 838, ms, and, 9, li, with, a, half, life, of, 178, ms, all, of, the, remaining, radioactive, isotopes, have, half, lives, that, are, shorter, than, 8, 6, ms, the, shortest, lived, isotope, of, lithium, is, 4, li, which, decays, through, proton, emission, and, has, a, half, life, of, 7, 6, 10, 23, s, the, 6, li, isotope, is, one, of, only, five, stable, nuclides, to, have, both, an, odd, number, of, protons, and, an, odd, number, of, neutrons, the, other, four, stable, odd, odd, nuclides, being, hydrogen, 2, boron, 10, nitrogen, 14, and, tantalum, 180m, 7, li, is, one, of, the, primordial, elements, or, more, properly, primordial, nuclides, produced, in, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, a, small, amount, of, both, 6, li, and, 7, li, are, produced, in, stars, during, stellar, nucleosynthesis, but, it, is, further, burned, as, fast, as, produced, 7, li, can, also, be, generated, in, carbon, stars, additional, small, amounts, of, both, 6, li, and, 7, li, may, be, generated, from, solar, wind, cosmic, rays, hitting, heavier, atoms, and, from, early, solar, system, 7, be, radioactive, decay, lithium, isotopes, fractionate, substantially, during, a, wide, variety, of, natural, processes, including, mineral, formation, chemical, precipitation, metabolism, and, ion, exchange, lithium, ions, substitute, for, magnesium, and, iron, in, octahedral, sites, in, clay, minerals, where, 6, li, is, preferred, to, 7, li, resulting, in, enrichment, of, the, light, isotope, in, processes, of, hyperfiltration, and, rock, alteration, the, exotic, 11, li, is, known, to, exhibit, a, neutron, halo, with, 2, neutrons, orbiting, around, its, nucleus, of, 3, protons, and, 6, neutrons, the, process, known, as, laser, isotope, separation, can, be, used, to, separate, lithium, isotopes, in, particular, 7, li, from, 6, li, nuclear, weapons, manufacture, and, other, nuclear, physics, applications, are, a, major, source, of, artificial, lithium, fractionation, with, the, light, isotope, 6, li, being, retained, by, industry, and, military, stockpiles, to, such, an, extent, that, it, has, caused, slight, but, measurable, change, in, the, 6, li, to, 7, li, ratios, in, natural, sources, such, as, rivers, this, has, led, to, unusual, uncertainty, in, the, standardized, atomic, weight, of, lithium, since, this, quantity, depends, on, the, natural, abundance, ratios, of, these, naturally, occurring, stable, lithium, isotopes, as, they, are, available, in, commercial, lithium, mineral, sources, both, stable, isotopes, of, lithium, can, be, laser, cooled, and, were, used, to, produce, the, first, quantum, degenerate, bose, fermi, mixture, although, it, was, synthesized, in, the, big, bang, lithium, together, with, beryllium, and, boron, is, markedly, less, abundant, in, the, universe, than, other, elements, this, is, a, result, of, the, comparatively, low, stellar, temperatures, necessary, to, destroy, lithium, along, with, a, lack, of, common, processes, to, produce, it, according, to, modern, cosmological, theory, lithium, in, both, stable, isotopes, lithium, 6, and, lithium, 7, was, one, of, the, three, elements, synthesized, in, the, big, bang, though, the, amount, of, lithium, generated, in, big, bang, nucleosynthesis, is, dependent, upon, the, number, of, photons, per, baryon, for, accepted, values, the, lithium, abundance, can, be, calculated, and, there, is, a, cosmological, lithium, discrepancy, in, the, universe, older, stars, seem, to, have, less, lithium, than, they, should, and, some, younger, stars, have, much, more, the, lack, of, lithium, in, older, stars, is, apparently, caused, by, the, mixing, of, lithium, into, the, interior, of, stars, where, it, is, destroyed, while, lithium, is, produced, in, younger, stars, although, it, transmutes, into, two, atoms, of, helium, due, to, collision, with, a, proton, at, temperatures, above, 2, 4, million, degrees, celsius, most, stars, easily, attain, this, temperature, in, their, interiors, lithium, is, more, abundant, than, computations, would, predict, in, later, generation, stars, lithium, is, also, found, in, brown, dwarf, substellar, objects, and, certain, anomalous, orange, stars, because, lithium, is, present, in, cooler, less, massive, brown, dwarfs, but, is, destroyed, in, hotter, red, dwarf, stars, its, presence, in, the, stars, spectra, can, be, used, in, the, lithium, test, to, differentiate, the, two, as, both, are, smaller, than, the, sun, certain, orange, stars, can, also, contain, a, high, concentration, of, lithium, those, orange, stars, found, to, have, a, higher, than, usual, concentration, of, lithium, such, as, centaurus, x, 4, orbit, massive, objects, neutron, stars, or, black, holes, whose, gravity, evidently, pulls, heavier, lithium, to, the, surface, of, a, hydrogen, helium, star, causing, more, lithium, to, be, observed, on, 27, may, 2020, astronomers, reported, that, classical, nova, explosions, are, galactic, producers, of, lithium, 7, although, lithium, is, widely, distributed, on, earth, it, does, not, naturally, occur, in, elemental, form, due, to, its, high, reactivity, the, total, lithium, content, of, seawater, is, very, large, and, is, estimated, as, 230, billion, tonnes, where, the, element, exists, at, a, relatively, constant, concentration, of, 0, 14, to, 0, 25, parts, per, million, ppm, or, 25, micromolar, higher, concentrations, approaching, 7, ppm, are, found, near, hydrothermal, vents, estimates, for, the, earth, s, crustal, content, range, from, 20, to, 70, ppm, by, weight, lithium, constitutes, about, 0, 002, percent, of, earth, s, crust, in, keeping, with, its, name, lithium, forms, a, minor, part, of, igneous, rocks, with, the, largest, concentrations, in, granites, granitic, pegmatites, also, provide, the, greatest, abundance, of, lithium, containing, minerals, with, spodumene, and, petalite, being, the, most, commercially, viable, sources, another, significant, mineral, of, lithium, is, lepidolite, which, is, now, an, obsolete, name, for, a, series, formed, by, polylithionite, and, trilithionite, another, source, for, lithium, is, hectorite, clay, the, only, active, development, of, which, is, through, the, western, lithium, corporation, in, the, united, states, at, 20, mg, lithium, per, kg, of, earth, s, crust, lithium, is, the, 31st, most, abundant, element, according, to, the, handbook, of, lithium, and, natural, calcium, lithium, is, a, comparatively, rare, element, although, it, is, found, in, many, rocks, and, some, brines, but, always, in, very, low, concentrations, there, are, a, fairly, large, number, of, both, lithium, mineral, and, brine, deposits, but, only, comparatively, few, of, them, are, of, actual, or, potential, commercial, value, many, are, very, small, others, are, too, low, in, grade, chile, is, estimated, 2020, to, have, the, largest, reserves, by, far, 9, 2, million, tonnes, and, australia, the, highest, annual, production, 40, 000, tonnes, one, of, the, largest, reserve, bases, of, lithium, is, in, the, salar, de, uyuni, area, of, bolivia, which, has, 5, 4, million, tonnes, other, major, suppliers, include, australia, argentina, and, china, as, of, 2015, the, czech, geological, survey, considered, the, entire, ore, mountains, in, the, czech, republic, as, lithium, province, five, deposits, are, registered, one, near, c, novec, is, considered, as, a, potentially, economical, deposit, with, 160, 000, tonnes, of, lithium, in, december, 2019, finnish, mining, company, keliber, oy, reported, its, rapasaari, lithium, deposit, has, estimated, proven, and, probable, ore, reserves, of, 5, 280, million, tonnes, in, june, 2010, the, new, york, times, reported, that, american, geologists, were, conducting, ground, surveys, on, dry, salt, lakes, in, western, afghanistan, believing, that, large, deposits, of, lithium, are, located, there, these, estimates, are, based, principally, on, old, data, which, was, gathered, mainly, by, the, soviets, during, their, occupation, of, afghanistan, from, 1979, 1989, the, department, of, defense, estimated, the, lithium, reserves, in, afghanistan, to, amount, to, the, ones, in, bolivia, and, dubbed, it, as, a, potential, saudi, arabia, of, lithium, in, cornwall, england, the, presence, of, brine, rich, in, lithium, was, well, known, due, to, the, region, s, historic, mining, industry, and, private, investors, have, conducted, tests, to, investigate, potential, lithium, extraction, in, this, area, lithium, is, found, in, trace, amount, in, numerous, plants, plankton, and, invertebrates, at, concentrations, of, 69, to, 5, 760, parts, per, billion, ppb, in, vertebrates, the, concentration, is, slightly, lower, and, nearly, all, vertebrate, tissue, and, body, fluids, contain, lithium, ranging, from, 21, to, 763, ppb, marine, organisms, tend, to, bioaccumulate, lithium, more, than, terrestrial, organisms, whether, lithium, has, a, physiological, role, in, any, of, these, organisms, is, unknown, lithium, concentrations, in, human, tissue, averages, about, 24, ppb, 4, ppb, in, blood, and, 1, 3, ppm, in, bone, lithium, is, easily, absorbed, by, plants, and, lithium, concentration, in, plant, tissue, is, typically, around, 1, ppm, some, plant, families, bioaccumulate, more, lithium, than, others, dry, weight, lithium, concentrations, for, members, of, the, family, solanaceae, which, includes, potatoes, and, tomatoes, for, instance, can, be, as, high, as, 30, ppm, while, this, can, be, as, low, as, 0, 05, ppb, for, corn, grains, studies, of, lithium, concentrations, in, mineral, rich, soil, give, ranges, between, around, 0, 1, and, 50, 100, ppm, with, some, concentrations, as, high, as, 100, 400, ppm, although, it, is, unlikely, that, all, of, it, is, available, for, uptake, by, plants, lithium, accumulation, does, not, appear, to, affect, the, essential, nutrient, composition, of, plants, tolerance, to, lithium, varies, by, plant, species, and, typically, parallels, sodium, tolerance, maize, and, rhodes, grass, for, example, are, highly, tolerant, to, lithium, injury, while, avocado, and, soybean, are, very, sensitive, similarly, lithium, at, concentrations, of, 5, ppm, reduces, seed, germination, in, some, species, e, g, asian, rice, and, chickpea, but, not, in, others, e, g, barley, and, wheat, many, of, lithium, s, major, biological, effects, can, be, explained, by, its, competition, with, other, ions, the, monovalent, lithium, ion, li, competes, with, other, ions, such, as, sodium, immediately, below, lithium, on, the, periodic, table, which, like, lithium, is, also, a, monovalent, alkali, metal, lithium, also, competes, with, bivalent, magnesium, ions, whose, ionic, radius, 86, pm, is, approximately, that, of, the, lithium, ion, 90, pm, mechanisms, that, transport, sodium, across, cellular, membranes, also, transport, lithium, for, instance, sodium, channels, both, voltage, gated, and, epithelial, are, particularly, major, pathways, of, entry, for, lithium, lithium, ions, can, also, permeate, through, ligand, gated, ion, channels, as, well, as, cross, both, nuclear, and, mitochondrial, membranes, like, sodium, lithium, can, enter, and, partially, block, although, not, permeate, potassium, channels, and, calcium, channels, the, biological, effects, of, lithium, are, many, and, varied, but, its, mechanisms, of, action, are, only, partially, understood, for, instance, studies, of, lithium, treated, patients, with, bipolar, disorder, show, that, among, many, other, effects, lithium, partially, reverses, telomere, shortening, in, these, patients, and, also, increases, mitochondrial, function, although, how, lithium, produces, these, pharmacological, effects, is, not, understood, even, the, exact, mechanisms, involved, in, lithium, toxicity, are, not, fully, understood, petalite, lialsi, 4, o, 10, was, discovered, in, 1800, by, the, brazilian, chemist, and, statesman, jos, bonif, cio, de, andrada, e, silva, in, a, mine, on, the, island, of, ut, sweden, however, it, was, not, until, 1817, that, johan, august, arfwedson, then, working, in, the, laboratory, of, the, chemist, j, ns, jakob, berzelius, detected, the, presence, of, a, new, element, while, analyzing, petalite, ore, this, element, formed, compounds, similar, to, those, of, sodium, and, potassium, though, its, carbonate, and, hydroxide, were, less, soluble, in, water, and, less, alkaline, berzelius, gave, the, alkaline, material, the, name, lithion, lithina, from, the, greek, word, o, transliterated, as, lithos, meaning, stone, to, reflect, its, discovery, in, a, solid, mineral, as, opposed, to, potassium, which, had, been, discovered, in, plant, ashes, and, sodium, which, was, known, partly, for, its, high, abundance, in, animal, blood, he, named, the, new, element, lithium, arfwedson, later, showed, that, this, same, element, was, present, in, the, minerals, spodumene, and, lepidolite, in, 1818, christian, gmelin, was, the, first, to, observe, that, lithium, salts, give, a, bright, red, color, to, flame, however, both, arfwedson, and, gmelin, tried, and, failed, to, isolate, the, pure, element, from, its, salts, it, was, not, isolated, until, 1821, when, william, thomas, brande, obtained, it, by, electrolysis, of, lithium, oxide, a, process, that, had, previously, been, employed, by, the, chemist, sir, humphry, davy, to, isolate, the, alkali, metals, potassium, and, sodium, brande, also, described, some, pure, salts, of, lithium, such, as, the, chloride, and, estimating, that, lithia, lithium, oxide, contained, about, 55, metal, estimated, the, atomic, weight, of, lithium, to, be, around, 9, 8, g, mol, modern, value, 6, 94, g, mol, in, 1855, larger, quantities, of, lithium, were, produced, through, the, electrolysis, of, lithium, chloride, by, robert, bunsen, and, augustus, matthiessen, the, discovery, of, this, procedure, led, to, commercial, production, of, lithium, in, 1923, by, the, german, company, metallgesellschaft, ag, which, performed, an, electrolysis, of, a, liquid, mixture, of, lithium, chloride, and, potassium, chloride, australian, psychiatrist, john, cade, is, credited, with, reintroducing, and, popularizing, the, use, of, lithium, to, treat, mania, in, 1949, shortly, after, throughout, the, mid, 20th, century, lithium, s, mood, stabilizing, applicability, for, mania, and, depression, took, off, in, europe, and, the, united, states, the, production, and, use, of, lithium, underwent, several, drastic, changes, in, history, the, first, major, application, of, lithium, was, in, high, temperature, lithium, greases, for, aircraft, engines, and, similar, applications, in, world, war, ii, and, shortly, after, this, use, was, supported, by, the, fact, that, lithium, based, soaps, have, a, higher, melting, point, than, other, alkali, soaps, and, are, less, corrosive, than, calcium, based, soaps, the, small, demand, for, lithium, soaps, and, lubricating, greases, was, supported, by, several, small, mining, operations, mostly, in, the, us, the, demand, for, lithium, increased, dramatically, during, the, cold, war, with, the, production, of, nuclear, fusion, weapons, both, lithium, 6, and, lithium, 7, produce, tritium, when, irradiated, by, neutrons, and, are, thus, useful, for, the, production, of, tritium, by, itself, as, well, as, a, form, of, solid, fusion, fuel, used, inside, hydrogen, bombs, in, the, form, of, lithium, deuteride, the, us, became, the, prime, producer, of, lithium, between, the, late, 1950s, and, the, mid, 1980s, at, the, end, the, stockpile, of, lithium, was, roughly, 42, 000, tonnes, of, lithium, hydroxide, the, stockpiled, lithium, was, depleted, in, lithium, 6, by, 75, which, was, enough, to, affect, the, measured, atomic, weight, of, lithium, in, many, standardized, chemicals, and, even, the, atomic, weight, of, lithium, in, some, natural, sources, of, lithium, ion, which, had, been, contaminated, by, lithium, salts, discharged, from, isotope, separation, facilities, which, had, found, its, way, into, ground, water, lithium, is, used, to, decrease, the, melting, temperature, of, glass, and, to, improve, the, melting, behavior, of, aluminium, oxide, in, the, hall, h, roult, process, these, two, uses, dominated, the, market, until, the, middle, of, the, 1990s, after, the, end, of, the, nuclear, arms, race, the, demand, for, lithium, decreased, and, the, sale, of, department, of, energy, stockpiles, on, the, open, market, further, reduced, prices, in, the, mid, 1990s, several, companies, started, to, isolate, lithium, from, brine, which, proved, to, be, a, less, expensive, option, than, underground, or, open, pit, mining, most, of, the, mines, closed, or, shifted, their, focus, to, other, materials, because, only, the, ore, from, zoned, pegmatites, could, be, mined, for, a, competitive, price, for, example, the, us, mines, near, kings, mountain, north, carolina, closed, before, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, the, development, of, lithium, ion, batteries, increased, the, demand, for, lithium, and, became, the, dominant, use, in, 2007, with, the, surge, of, lithium, demand, in, batteries, in, the, 2000s, new, companies, have, expanded, brine, isolation, efforts, to, meet, the, rising, demand, it, has, been, argued, that, lithium, will, be, one, of, the, main, objects, of, geopolitical, competition, in, a, world, running, on, renewable, energy, and, dependent, on, batteries, but, this, perspective, has, also, been, criticised, for, underestimating, the, power, of, economic, incentives, for, expanded, production, lithium, reacts, with, water, easily, but, with, noticeably, less, vigor, than, other, alkali, metals, the, reaction, forms, hydrogen, gas, and, lithium, hydroxide, when, placed, over, a, flame, lithium, compounds, give, off, a, striking, crimson, color, but, when, the, metal, burns, strongly, the, flame, becomes, a, brilliant, silver, lithium, will, ignite, and, burn, in, oxygen, when, exposed, to, water, or, water, vapor, in, moist, air, lithium, rapidly, tarnishes, to, form, a, black, coating, of, lithium, hydroxide, lioh, and, lioh, h, 2, o, lithium, nitride, li, 3, n, and, lithium, carbonate, li, 2, co, 3, the, result, of, a, secondary, reaction, between, lioh, and, co, 2, lithium, is, one, of, the, few, metals, that, react, with, nitrogen, gas, because, of, its, reactivity, with, water, and, especially, nitrogen, lithium, metal, is, usually, stored, in, a, hydrocarbon, sealant, often, petroleum, jelly, although, the, heavier, alkali, metals, can, be, stored, under, mineral, oil, lithium, is, not, dense, enough, to, fully, submerge, itself, in, these, liquids, lithium, has, a, diagonal, relationship, with, magnesium, an, element, of, similar, atomic, and, ionic, radius, chemical, resemblances, between, the, two, metals, include, the, formation, of, a, nitride, by, reaction, with, n, 2, the, formation, of, an, oxide, li, 2, o, and, peroxide, li, 2, o, 2, when, burnt, in, o, 2, salts, with, similar, solubilities, and, thermal, instability, of, the, carbonates, and, nitrides, the, metal, reacts, with, hydrogen, gas, at, high, temperatures, to, produce, lithium, hydride, lih, lithium, forms, a, variety, of, binary, and, ternary, materials, by, direct, reaction, with, the, main, group, elements, these, zintl, phases, although, highly, covalent, can, be, viewed, as, salts, of, polyatomic, anions, such, as, si, 4, 4, p, 7, 3, and, te, 5, 2, with, graphite, lithium, forms, a, variety, of, intercalation, compounds, it, dissolves, in, ammonia, and, amines, to, give, and, the, solvated, electron, lithium, forms, salt, like, derivatives, with, all, halides, and, pseudohalides, some, examples, include, the, halides, lif, licl, libr, lii, as, well, as, the, pseudohalides, and, related, anions, lithium, carbonate, has, been, described, as, the, most, important, compound, of, lithium, this, white, solid, is, the, principal, product, of, beneficiation, of, lithium, ores, it, is, a, precursor, to, other, salts, including, ceramics, and, materials, for, lithium, batteries, the, compounds, libh, 4, and, lialh, 4, are, useful, reagents, these, salts, and, many, other, lithium, salts, exhibit, distinctively, high, solubility, in, ethers, in, contrast, with, salts, of, heavier, alkali, metals, in, aqueous, solution, the, coordination, complex, predominates, for, many, lithium, salts, related, complexes, are, known, with, amines, and, ethers, organolithium, compounds, are, numerous, and, useful, they, are, defined, by, the, presence, of, a, bond, between, carbon, and, lithium, they, serve, as, metal, stabilized, carbanions, although, their, solution, and, solid, state, structures, are, more, complex, than, this, simplistic, view, thus, these, are, extremely, powerful, bases, and, nucleophiles, they, have, also, been, applied, in, asymmetric, synthesis, in, the, pharmaceutical, industry, for, laboratory, organic, synthesis, many, organolithium, reagents, are, commercially, available, in, solution, form, these, reagents, are, highly, reactive, and, are, sometimes, pyrophoric, like, its, inorganic, compounds, almost, all, organic, compounds, of, lithium, formally, follow, the, duet, rule, e, g, buli, meli, however, it, is, important, to, note, that, in, the, absence, of, coordinating, solvents, or, ligands, organolithium, compounds, form, dimeric, tetrameric, and, hexameric, clusters, e, g, buli, is, actually, 6, and, meli, is, actually, 4, which, feature, multi, center, bonding, and, increase, the, coordination, number, around, lithium, these, clusters, are, broken, down, into, smaller, or, monomeric, units, in, the, presence, of, solvents, like, dimethoxyethane, dme, or, ligands, like, tetramethylethylenediamine, tmeda, as, an, exception, to, the, duet, rule, a, two, coordinate, lithate, complex, with, four, electrons, around, lithium, has, been, characterized, crystallographically, lithium, production, has, greatly, increased, since, the, end, of, world, war, ii, the, main, sources, of, lithium, are, brines, and, ores, lithium, metal, is, produced, through, electrolysis, applied, to, a, mixture, of, fused, 55, lithium, chloride, and, 45, potassium, chloride, at, about, 450, c, the, small, ionic, size, makes, it, difficult, for, lithium, to, be, included, in, early, stages, of, mineral, crystallization, as, a, result, lithium, remains, in, the, molten, phases, where, it, gets, enriched, until, it, gets, solidified, in, the, final, stages, such, lithium, enrichment, is, responsible, for, all, commercially, promising, lithium, ore, deposits, brines, and, dry, salt, are, another, important, source, of, li, although, the, number, of, known, lithium, containing, deposits, and, brines, is, large, most, of, them, are, either, small, or, have, too, low, li, concentrations, thus, only, a, few, appear, to, be, of, commercial, value, the, us, geological, survey, usgs, estimated, worldwide, identified, lithium, reserves, in, 2020, and, 2021, to, be, 17, million, and, 21, million, tonnes, respectively, an, accurate, estimate, of, world, lithium, reserves, is, difficult, one, reason, for, this, is, that, most, lithium, classification, schemes, are, developed, for, solid, ore, deposits, whereas, brine, is, a, fluid, that, is, problematic, to, treat, with, the, same, classification, scheme, due, to, varying, concentrations, and, pumping, effects, in, 2019, world, production, of, lithium, from, spodumene, was, around, 80, 000t, per, annum, primarily, from, the, greenbushes, pegmatite, and, from, some, chinese, and, chilean, sources, the, talison, mine, in, greenbushes, is, reported, to, be, the, largest, and, to, have, the, highest, grade, of, ore, at, 2, 4, li, 2, o, 2012, figures, the, world, s, top, four, lithium, producing, countries, from, 2019, as, reported, by, the, us,
