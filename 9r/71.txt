the, watt, symbol, w, is, the, unit, of, power, or, radiant, flux, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, equal, to, 1, joule, per, second, or, 1, kg, m, 2, s, 3, it, is, used, to, quantify, the, rate, of, energy, transfer, the, watt, is, named, in, honor, of, james, watt, 1736, 1819, an, 18th, century, scottish, inventor, mechanical, engineer, and, chemist, who, improved, the, newcomen, engine, with, his, own, steam, engine, in, 1776, watt, s, invention, was, fundamental, for, the, industrial, revolution, when, an, object, s, velocity, is, held, constant, at, one, meter, per, second, against, a, constant, opposing, force, of, one, newton, the, rate, at, which, work, is, done, is, one, watt, 1, w, 1, j, s, 1, n, m, s, 1, k, g, m, 2, s, 3, displaystyle, mathrm, 1, w, 1, j, s, 1, n, cdot, m, s, 1, kg, cdot, m, 2, cdot, s, 3, in, terms, of, electromagnetism, one, watt, is, the, rate, at, which, electrical, work, is, performed, when, a, current, of, one, ampere, a, flows, across, an, electrical, potential, difference, of, one, volt, v, meaning, the, watt, is, equivalent, to, the, volt, ampere, the, latter, unit, however, is, used, for, a, different, quantity, from, the, real, power, of, an, electrical, circuit, 1, w, 1, v, a, displaystyle, mathrm, 1, w, 1, v, cdot, a, two, additional, unit, conversions, for, watt, can, be, found, using, the, above, equation, and, ohm, s, law, 1, w, 1, v, 2, 1, a, 2, displaystyle, mathrm, 1, w, 1, v, 2, omega, 1, a, 2, cdot, omega, where, ohm, displaystyle, omega, is, the, si, derived, unit, of, electrical, resistance, the, watt, is, named, after, the, scottish, inventor, james, watt, the, unit, name, was, proposed, by, c, william, siemens, in, august, 1882, in, his, president, s, address, to, the, fifty, second, congress, of, the, british, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, noting, that, units, in, the, practical, system, of, units, were, named, after, leading, physicists, siemens, proposed, that, watt, might, be, an, appropriate, name, for, a, unit, of, power, siemens, defined, the, unit, within, the, existing, system, of, practical, units, as, the, power, conveyed, by, a, current, of, an, amp, re, through, the, difference, of, potential, of, a, volt, in, october, 1908, at, the, international, conference, on, electric, units, and, standards, in, london, so, called, international, definitions, were, established, for, practical, electrical, units, siemens, definition, was, adopted, as, the, international, watt, also, used, 1, a, 2, 1, the, watt, was, defined, as, equal, to, 10, 7, units, of, power, in, the, practical, system, of, units, the, international, units, were, dominant, from, 1909, until, 1948, after, the, 9th, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, in, 1948, the, international, watt, was, redefined, from, practical, units, to, absolute, units, i, e, using, only, length, mass, and, time, concretely, this, meant, that, 1, watt, was, defined, as, the, quantity, of, energy, transferred, in, a, unit, of, time, namely, 1, j, s, in, this, new, definition, 1, absolute, watt, 1, 00019, international, watts, texts, written, before, 1948, are, likely, to, be, using, the, international, watt, which, implies, caution, when, comparing, numerical, values, from, this, period, with, the, post, 1948, watt, in, 1960, the, 11th, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, adopted, the, absolute, watt, into, the, international, system, of, units, si, as, the, unit, of, power, in, the, electric, power, industry, megawatt, electrical, mwe, or, mw, e, refers, by, convention, to, the, electric, power, produced, by, a, generator, while, megawatt, thermal, or, thermal, megawatt, mwt, mw, t, or, mwth, mw, th, refers, to, thermal, power, produced, by, the, plant, for, example, the, embalse, nuclear, power, plant, in, argentina, uses, a, fission, reactor, to, generate, 2, 109, mw, t, i, e, heat, which, creates, steam, to, drive, a, turbine, which, generates, 648, mw, e, i, e, electricity, other, si, prefixes, are, sometimes, used, for, example, gigawatt, electrical, gw, e, the, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, which, maintains, the, si, standard, states, that, further, information, about, a, quantity, should, not, be, attached, to, the, unit, symbol, but, instead, to, the, quantity, symbol, e, g, p, th, 270, w, rather, than, p, 270, w, th, and, so, these, unit, symbols, are, non, si, in, compliance, with, si, the, energy, company, rsted, a, s, uses, the, unit, megawatt, for, produced, electrical, power, and, the, equivalent, unit, megajoule, per, second, for, delivered, heating, power, in, a, combined, heat, and, power, station, such, as, aved, re, power, station, when, describing, alternating, current, ac, electricity, another, distinction, is, made, between, the, watt, and, the, volt, ampere, while, these, units, are, equivalent, for, simple, resistive, circuits, they, differ, when, loads, exhibit, electrical, reactance, radio, stations, usually, report, the, power, of, their, transmitters, in, units, of, watts, referring, to, the, effective, radiated, power, this, refers, to, the, power, that, a, half, wave, dipole, antenna, would, need, to, radiate, to, match, the, intensity, of, the, transmitter, s, main, lobe, the, terms, power, and, energy, are, closely, related, but, distinct, physical, quantities, power, is, the, rate, at, which, energy, is, generated, or, consumed, and, hence, is, measured, in, units, e, g, watts, that, represent, energy, per, unit, time, for, example, when, a, light, bulb, with, a, power, rating, of, 100, w, is, turned, on, for, one, hour, the, energy, used, is, 100, watt, hours, w, h, 0, 1, kilowatt, hour, or, 360, kj, this, same, amount, of, energy, would, light, a, 40, watt, bulb, for, 2, 5, hours, or, a, 50, watt, bulb, for, 2, hours, power, stations, are, rated, using, units, of, power, typically, megawatts, or, gigawatts, for, example, the, three, gorges, dam, in, china, is, rated, at, approximately, 22, gigawatts, this, reflects, the, maximum, power, output, it, can, achieve, at, any, point, in, time, a, power, station, s, annual, energy, output, however, would, be, recorded, using, units, of, energy, not, power, typically, gigawatt, hours, major, energy, production, or, consumption, is, often, expressed, as, terawatt, hours, for, a, given, period, often, a, calendar, year, or, financial, year, one, terawatt, hour, of, energy, is, equal, to, a, sustained, power, delivery, of, one, terawatt, for, one, hour, or, approximately, 114, megawatts, for, a, period, of, one, year, equivalent, to, approximately, 114, megawatts, of, constant, power, output, the, watt, second, is, a, unit, of, energy, equal, to, the, joule, one, kilowatt, hour, is, 3, 600, 000, watt, seconds, while, a, watt, per, hour, is, a, unit, of, rate, of, change, of, power, with, time, it, is, not, correct, to, refer, to, a, watt, or, watt, hour, as, a, watt, per, hour
