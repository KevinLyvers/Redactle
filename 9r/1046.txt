a, neutrino, nj, u, t, r, i, n, o, new, tree, noh, denoted, by, the, greek, letter, is, a, fermion, an, elementary, particle, with, spin, of, 1, 2, that, interacts, only, via, the, weak, interaction, and, gravity, the, neutrino, is, so, named, because, it, is, electrically, neutral, and, because, its, rest, mass, is, so, small, ino, that, it, was, long, thought, to, be, zero, the, rest, mass, of, the, neutrino, is, much, smaller, than, that, of, the, other, known, elementary, particles, excluding, massless, particles, the, weak, force, has, a, very, short, range, the, gravitational, interaction, is, extremely, weak, due, to, the, very, small, mass, of, the, neutrino, and, neutrinos, do, not, participate, in, the, electromagnetic, interaction, or, the, strong, interaction, thus, neutrinos, typically, pass, through, normal, matter, unimpeded, and, undetected, weak, interactions, create, neutrinos, in, one, of, three, leptonic, flavors, each, flavor, is, associated, with, the, correspondingly, named, charged, lepton, although, neutrinos, were, long, believed, to, be, massless, it, is, now, known, that, there, are, three, discrete, neutrino, masses, with, different, tiny, values, the, smallest, of, which, could, even, be, zero, but, the, three, masses, do, not, uniquely, correspond, to, the, three, flavors, a, neutrino, created, with, a, specific, flavor, is, a, specific, mixture, of, all, three, mass, states, a, quantum, superposition, similar, to, some, other, neutral, particles, neutrinos, oscillate, between, different, flavors, in, flight, as, a, consequence, for, example, an, electron, neutrino, produced, in, a, beta, decay, reaction, may, interact, in, a, distant, detector, as, a, muon, or, tau, neutrino, the, three, mass, values, are, not, yet, known, as, of, 2024, but, laboratory, experiments, and, cosmological, observations, have, determined, the, differences, of, their, squares, an, upper, limit, on, their, sum, 2, 14, 10, 37, kg, and, an, upper, limit, on, the, mass, of, the, electron, neutrino, for, each, neutrino, there, also, exists, a, corresponding, antiparticle, called, an, antineutrino, which, also, has, spin, of, 1, 2, and, no, electric, charge, antineutrinos, are, distinguished, from, neutrinos, by, having, opposite, signed, lepton, number, and, weak, isospin, and, right, handed, instead, of, left, handed, chirality, to, conserve, total, lepton, number, in, nuclear, beta, decay, electron, neutrinos, only, appear, together, with, positrons, anti, electrons, or, electron, antineutrinos, whereas, electron, antineutrinos, only, appear, with, electrons, or, electron, neutrinos, neutrinos, are, created, by, various, radioactive, decays, the, following, list, is, not, exhaustive, but, includes, some, of, those, processes, the, majority, of, neutrinos, which, are, detected, about, the, earth, are, from, nuclear, reactions, inside, the, sun, at, the, surface, of, the, earth, the, flux, is, about, 65, billion, 6, 5, 10, 10, solar, neutrinos, per, second, per, square, centimeter, neutrinos, can, be, used, for, tomography, of, the, interior, of, the, earth, the, neutrino, was, postulated, first, by, wolfgang, pauli, in, 1930, to, explain, how, beta, decay, could, conserve, energy, momentum, and, angular, momentum, spin, in, contrast, to, niels, bohr, who, proposed, a, statistical, version, of, the, conservation, laws, to, explain, the, observed, continuous, energy, spectra, in, beta, decay, pauli, hypothesized, an, undetected, particle, that, he, called, a, neutron, using, the, same, on, ending, employed, for, naming, both, the, proton, and, the, electron, he, considered, that, the, new, particle, was, emitted, from, the, nucleus, together, with, the, electron, or, beta, particle, in, the, process, of, beta, decay, and, had, a, mass, similar, to, the, electron, james, chadwick, discovered, a, much, more, massive, neutral, nuclear, particle, in, 1932, and, named, it, a, neutron, also, leaving, two, kinds, of, particles, with, the, same, name, the, word, neutrino, entered, the, scientific, vocabulary, through, enrico, fermi, who, used, it, during, a, conference, in, paris, in, july, 1932, and, at, the, solvay, conference, in, october, 1933, where, pauli, also, employed, it, the, name, the, italian, equivalent, of, little, neutral, one, was, jokingly, coined, by, edoardo, amaldi, during, a, conversation, with, fermi, at, the, institute, of, physics, of, via, panisperna, in, rome, in, order, to, distinguish, this, light, neutral, particle, from, chadwick, s, heavy, neutron, in, fermi, s, theory, of, beta, decay, chadwick, s, large, neutral, particle, could, decay, to, a, proton, electron, and, the, smaller, neutral, particle, now, called, an, electron, antineutrino, fermi, s, paper, written, in, 1934, unified, pauli, s, neutrino, with, paul, dirac, s, positron, and, werner, heisenberg, s, neutron, proton, model, and, gave, a, solid, theoretical, basis, for, future, experimental, work, 24, by, 1934, there, was, experimental, evidence, against, bohr, s, idea, that, energy, conservation, is, invalid, for, beta, decay, at, the, solvay, conference, of, that, year, measurements, of, the, energy, spectra, of, beta, particles, electrons, were, reported, showing, that, there, is, a, strict, limit, on, the, energy, of, electrons, from, each, type, of, beta, decay, such, a, limit, is, not, expected, if, the, conservation, of, energy, is, invalid, in, which, case, any, amount, of, energy, would, be, statistically, available, in, at, least, a, few, decays, the, natural, explanation, of, the, beta, decay, spectrum, as, first, measured, in, 1934, was, that, only, a, limited, and, conserved, amount, of, energy, was, available, and, a, new, particle, was, sometimes, taking, a, varying, fraction, of, this, limited, energy, leaving, the, rest, for, the, beta, particle, pauli, made, use, of, the, occasion, to, publicly, emphasize, that, the, still, undetected, neutrino, must, be, an, actual, particle, 25, the, first, evidence, of, the, reality, of, neutrinos, came, in, 1938, via, simultaneous, cloud, chamber, measurements, of, the, electron, and, the, recoil, of, the, nucleus, in, 1942, wang, ganchang, first, proposed, the, use, of, beta, capture, to, experimentally, detect, neutrinos, in, the, 20, july, 1956, issue, of, science, clyde, cowan, frederick, reines, francis, b, kiko, harrison, herald, w, kruse, and, austin, d, mcguire, published, confirmation, that, they, had, detected, the, neutrino, a, result, that, was, rewarded, almost, forty, years, later, with, the, 1995, nobel, prize, in, this, experiment, now, known, as, the, cowan, reines, neutrino, experiment, antineutrinos, created, in, a, nuclear, reactor, by, beta, decay, reacted, with, protons, to, produce, neutrons, and, positrons, the, positron, quickly, finds, an, electron, and, they, annihilate, each, other, the, two, resulting, gamma, rays, are, detectable, the, neutron, can, be, detected, by, its, capture, on, an, appropriate, nucleus, releasing, a, gamma, ray, the, coincidence, of, both, events, positron, annihilation, and, neutron, capture, gives, a, unique, signature, of, an, antineutrino, interaction, in, february, 1965, the, first, neutrino, found, in, nature, was, identified, by, a, group, including, frederick, reines, and, friedel, sellschop, the, experiment, was, performed, in, a, specially, prepared, chamber, at, a, depth, of, 3, km, in, the, east, rand, erpm, gold, mine, near, boksburg, south, africa, a, plaque, in, the, main, building, commemorates, the, discovery, the, experiments, also, implemented, a, primitive, neutrino, astronomy, and, looked, at, issues, of, neutrino, physics, and, weak, interactions, the, antineutrino, discovered, by, clyde, cowan, and, frederick, reines, was, the, antiparticle, of, the, electron, neutrino, in, 1962, leon, m, lederman, melvin, schwartz, and, jack, steinberger, showed, that, more, than, one, type, of, neutrino, exists, by, first, detecting, interactions, of, the, muon, neutrino, already, hypothesised, with, the, name, neutretto, which, earned, them, the, 1988, nobel, prize, in, physics, when, the, third, type, of, lepton, the, tau, was, discovered, in, 1975, at, the, stanford, linear, accelerator, center, it, was, also, expected, to, have, an, associated, neutrino, the, tau, neutrino, the, first, evidence, for, this, third, neutrino, type, came, from, the, observation, of, missing, energy, and, momentum, in, tau, decays, analogous, to, the, beta, decay, leading, to, the, discovery, of, the, electron, neutrino, the, first, detection, of, tau, neutrino, interactions, was, announced, in, 2000, by, the, donut, collaboration, at, fermilab, its, existence, had, already, been, inferred, by, both, theoretical, consistency, and, experimental, data, from, the, large, electron, positron, collider, in, the, 1960s, the, now, famous, homestake, experiment, made, the, first, measurement, of, the, flux, of, electron, neutrinos, arriving, from, the, core, of, the, sun, and, found, a, value, that, was, between, one, third, and, one, half, the, number, predicted, by, the, standard, solar, model, this, discrepancy, which, became, known, as, the, solar, neutrino, problem, remained, unresolved, for, some, thirty, years, while, possible, problems, with, both, the, experiment, and, the, solar, model, were, investigated, but, none, could, be, found, eventually, it, was, realized, that, both, were, actually, correct, and, that, the, discrepancy, between, them, was, due, to, neutrinos, being, more, complex, than, was, previously, assumed, it, was, postulated, that, the, three, neutrinos, had, nonzero, and, slightly, different, masses, and, could, therefore, oscillate, into, undetectable, flavors, on, their, flight, to, the, earth, this, hypothesis, was, investigated, by, a, new, series, of, experiments, thereby, opening, a, new, major, field, of, research, that, still, continues, eventual, confirmation, of, the, phenomenon, of, neutrino, oscillation, led, to, two, nobel, prizes, one, to, r, davis, who, conceived, and, led, the, homestake, experiment, and, masatoshi, koshiba, of, kamiokande, whose, work, confirmed, it, and, one, to, takaaki, kajita, of, super, kamiokande, and, a, b, mcdonald, of, sno, for, their, joint, experiment, which, confirmed, the, existence, of, all, three, neutrino, flavors, and, found, no, deficit, a, practical, method, for, investigating, neutrino, oscillations, was, first, suggested, by, bruno, pontecorvo, in, 1957, using, an, analogy, with, kaon, oscillations, over, the, subsequent, 10, years, he, developed, the, mathematical, formalism, and, the, modern, formulation, of, vacuum, oscillations, in, 1985, stanislav, mikheyev, and, alexei, smirnov, expanding, on, 1978, work, by, lincoln, wolfenstein, noted, that, flavor, oscillations, can, be, modified, when, neutrinos, propagate, through, matter, this, so, called, mikheyev, smirnov, wolfenstein, effect, msw, effect, is, important, to, understand, because, many, neutrinos, emitted, by, fusion, in, the, sun, pass, through, the, dense, matter, in, the, solar, core, where, essentially, all, solar, fusion, takes, place, on, their, way, to, detectors, on, earth, starting, in, 1998, experiments, began, to, show, that, solar, and, atmospheric, neutrinos, change, flavors, see, super, kamiokande, and, sudbury, neutrino, observatory, this, resolved, the, solar, neutrino, problem, the, electron, neutrinos, produced, in, the, sun, had, partly, changed, into, other, flavors, which, the, experiments, could, not, detect, although, individual, experiments, such, as, the, set, of, solar, neutrino, experiments, are, consistent, with, non, oscillatory, mechanisms, of, neutrino, flavor, conversion, taken, altogether, neutrino, experiments, imply, the, existence, of, neutrino, oscillations, especially, relevant, in, this, context, are, the, reactor, experiment, kamland, and, the, accelerator, experiments, such, as, minos, the, kamland, experiment, has, indeed, identified, oscillations, as, the, neutrino, flavor, conversion, mechanism, involved, in, the, solar, electron, neutrinos, similarly, minos, confirms, the, oscillation, of, atmospheric, neutrinos, and, gives, a, better, determination, of, the, mass, squared, splitting, takaaki, kajita, of, japan, and, arthur, b, mcdonald, of, canada, received, the, 2015, nobel, prize, for, physics, for, their, landmark, finding, theoretical, and, experimental, that, neutrinos, can, change, flavors, as, well, as, specific, sources, a, general, background, level, of, neutrinos, is, expected, to, pervade, the, universe, theorized, to, occur, due, to, two, main, sources, around, 1, second, after, the, big, bang, neutrinos, decoupled, giving, rise, to, a, background, level, of, neutrinos, known, as, the, cosmic, neutrino, background, cnb, r, davis, and, m, koshiba, were, jointly, awarded, the, 2002, nobel, prize, in, physics, both, conducted, pioneering, work, on, solar, neutrino, detection, and, koshiba, s, work, also, resulted, in, the, first, real, time, observation, of, neutrinos, from, the, sn, 1987a, supernova, in, the, nearby, large, magellanic, cloud, these, efforts, marked, the, beginning, of, neutrino, astronomy, sn, 1987a, represents, the, only, verified, detection, of, neutrinos, from, a, supernova, however, many, stars, have, gone, supernova, in, the, universe, leaving, a, theorized, diffuse, supernova, neutrino, background, neutrinos, have, half, integer, spin, 1, 2, therefore, they, are, fermions, neutrinos, are, leptons, they, have, only, been, observed, to, interact, through, the, weak, force, although, it, is, assumed, that, they, also, interact, gravitationally, since, they, have, non, zero, mass, theoretical, considerations, permit, neutrinos, to, interact, magnetically, but, do, not, require, them, to, as, yet, there, is, no, experimental, evidence, for, a, non, zero, magnetic, moment, in, neutrinos, weak, interactions, create, neutrinos, in, one, of, three, leptonic, flavors, electron, neutrinos, e, muon, neutrinos, or, tau, neutrinos, associated, with, the, corresponding, charged, leptons, the, electron, e, muon, and, tau, respectively, although, neutrinos, were, long, believed, to, be, massless, it, is, now, known, that, there, are, three, discrete, neutrino, masses, each, neutrino, flavor, state, is, a, linear, combination, of, the, three, discrete, mass, eigenstates, although, only, differences, of, squares, of, the, three, mass, values, are, known, as, of, 2016, experiments, have, shown, that, these, masses, are, tiny, compared, to, any, other, particle, from, cosmological, measurements, it, has, been, calculated, that, the, sum, of, the, three, neutrino, masses, must, be, less, than, one, millionth, that, of, the, electron, more, formally, neutrino, flavor, eigenstates, creation, and, annihilation, combinations, are, not, the, same, as, the, neutrino, mass, eigenstates, simply, labeled, 1, 2, and, 3, as, of, 2024, it, is, not, known, which, of, these, three, is, the, heaviest, the, neutrino, mass, hierarchy, consists, of, two, possible, configurations, in, analogy, with, the, mass, hierarchy, of, the, charged, leptons, the, configuration, with, mass, 2, being, lighter, than, mass, 3, is, conventionally, called, the, normal, hierarchy, while, in, the, inverted, hierarchy, the, opposite, would, hold, several, major, experimental, efforts, are, underway, to, help, establish, which, is, correct, a, neutrino, created, in, a, specific, flavor, eigenstate, is, in, an, associated, specific, quantum, superposition, of, all, three, mass, eigenstates, the, three, masses, differ, so, little, that, they, cannot, possibly, be, distinguished, experimentally, within, any, practical, flight, path, the, proportion, of, each, mass, state, in, the, pure, flavor, states, produced, has, been, found, to, depend, profoundly, on, the, flavor, the, relationship, between, flavor, and, mass, eigenstates, is, encoded, in, the, pmns, matrix, experiments, have, established, moderate, to, low, precision, values, for, the, elements, of, this, matrix, with, the, single, complex, phase, in, the, matrix, being, only, poorly, known, as, of, 2016, a, non, zero, mass, allows, neutrinos, to, possibly, have, a, tiny, magnetic, moment, if, so, neutrinos, would, interact, electromagnetically, although, no, such, interaction, has, ever, been, observed, neutrinos, oscillate, between, different, flavors, in, flight, for, example, an, electron, neutrino, produced, in, a, beta, decay, reaction, may, interact, in, a, distant, detector, as, a, muon, or, tau, neutrino, as, defined, by, the, flavor, of, the, charged, lepton, produced, in, the, detector, this, oscillation, occurs, because, the, three, mass, state, components, of, the, produced, flavor, travel, at, slightly, different, speeds, so, that, their, quantum, mechanical, wave, packets, develop, relative, phase, shifts, that, change, how, they, combine, to, produce, a, varying, superposition, of, three, flavors, each, flavor, component, thereby, oscillates, as, the, neutrino, travels, with, the, flavors, varying, in, relative, strengths, the, relative, flavor, proportions, when, the, neutrino, interacts, represent, the, relative, probabilities, for, that, flavor, of, interaction, to, produce, the, corresponding, flavor, of, charged, lepton, there, are, other, possibilities, in, which, neutrinos, could, oscillate, even, if, they, were, massless, if, lorentz, symmetry, were, not, an, exact, symmetry, neutrinos, could, experience, lorentz, violating, oscillations, neutrinos, traveling, through, matter, in, general, undergo, a, process, analogous, to, light, traveling, through, a, transparent, material, this, process, is, not, directly, observable, because, it, does, not, produce, ionizing, radiation, but, gives, rise, to, the, mikheyev, smirnov, wolfenstein, effect, only, a, small, fraction, of, the, neutrino, s, energy, is, transferred, to, the, material, onia, for, each, neutrino, there, also, exists, a, corresponding, antiparticle, called, an, antineutrino, which, also, has, no, electric, charge, and, half, integer, spin, they, are, distinguished, from, the, neutrinos, by, having, opposite, signs, of, lepton, number, and, opposite, chirality, and, consequently, opposite, sign, weak, isospin, as, of, 2016, no, evidence, has, been, found, for, any, other, difference, so, far, despite, extensive, and, continuing, searches, for, exceptions, in, all, observed, leptonic, processes, there, has, never, been, any, change, in, total, lepton, number, for, example, if, the, total, lepton, number, is, zero, in, the, initial, state, then, the, final, state, has, only, matched, lepton, and, anti, lepton, pairs, electron, neutrinos, appear, in, the, final, state, together, with, only, positrons, anti, electrons, or, electron, antineutrinos, and, electron, antineutrinos, with, electrons, or, electron, neutrinos, antineutrinos, are, produced, in, nuclear, beta, decay, together, with, a, beta, particle, in, beta, decay, a, neutron, decays, into, a, proton, electron, and, antineutrino, all, antineutrinos, observed, thus, far, had, right, handed, helicity, i, e, only, one, of, the, two, possible, spin, states, has, ever, been, seen, while, neutrinos, were, all, left, handed, antineutrinos, were, first, detected, as, a, result, of, their, interaction, with, protons, in, a, large, tank, of, water, this, was, installed, next, to, a, nuclear, reactor, as, a, controllable, source, of, the, antineutrinos, see, cowan, reines, neutrino, experiment, researchers, around, the, world, have, begun, to, investigate, the, possibility, of, using, antineutrinos, for, reactor, monitoring, in, the, context, of, preventing, the, proliferation, of, nuclear, weapons, because, antineutrinos, and, neutrinos, are, neutral, particles, it, is, possible, that, they, are, the, same, particle, rather, than, conventional, dirac, fermions, neutral, particles, can, be, another, type, of, spin, 1, 2, particle, called, majorana, particles, named, after, the, italian, physicist, ettore, majorana, who, first, proposed, the, concept, for, the, case, of, neutrinos, this, theory, has, gained, popularity, as, it, can, be, used, in, combination, with, the, seesaw, mechanism, to, explain, why, neutrino, masses, are, so, small, compared, to, those, of, the, other, elementary, particles, such, as, electrons, or, quarks, majorana, neutrinos, would, have, the, property, that, the, neutrino, and, antineutrino, could, be, distinguished, only, by, chirality, what, experiments, observe, as, a, difference, between, the, neutrino, and, antineutrino, could, simply, be, due, to, one, particle, with, two, possible, chiralities, as, of, 2019, it, is, not, known, whether, neutrinos, are, majorana, or, dirac, particles, it, is, possible, to, test, this, property, experimentally, for, example, if, neutrinos, are, indeed, majorana, particles, then, lepton, number, violating, processes, such, as, neutrinoless, double, beta, decay, would, be, allowed, while, they, would, not, if, neutrinos, are, dirac, particles, several, experiments, have, been, and, are, being, conducted, to, search, for, this, process, e, g, gerda, exo, sno, and, cuore, the, cosmic, neutrino, background, is, also, a, probe, of, whether, neutrinos, are, majorana, particles, since, there, should, be, a, different, number, of, cosmic, neutrinos, detected, in, either, the, dirac, or, majorana, case, neutrinos, can, interact, with, a, nucleus, changing, it, to, another, nucleus, this, process, is, used, in, radiochemical, neutrino, detectors, in, this, case, the, energy, levels, and, spin, states, within, the, target, nucleus, have, to, be, taken, into, account, to, estimate, the, probability, for, an, interaction, in, general, the, interaction, probability, increases, with, the, number, of, neutrons, and, protons, within, a, nucleus, it, is, very, hard, to, uniquely, identify, neutrino, interactions, among, the, natural, background, of, radioactivity, for, this, reason, in, early, experiments, a, special, reaction, channel, was, chosen, to, facilitate, the, identification, the, interaction, of, an, antineutrino, with, one, of, the, hydrogen, nuclei, in, the, water, molecules, a, hydrogen, nucleus, is, a, single, proton, so, simultaneous, nuclear, interactions, which, would, occur, within, a, heavier, nucleus, do, not, need, to, be, considered, for, the, detection, experiment, within, a, cubic, meter, of, water, placed, right, outside, a, nuclear, reactor, only, relatively, few, such, interactions, can, be, recorded, but, the, setup, is, now, used, for, measuring, the, reactor, s, plutonium, production, rate, very, much, like, neutrons, do, in, nuclear, reactors, neutrinos, can, induce, fission, reactions, within, heavy, nuclei, so, far, this, reaction, has, not, been, measured, in, a, laboratory, but, is, predicted, to, happen, within, stars, and, supernovae, the, process, affects, the, abundance, of, isotopes, seen, in, the, universe, neutrino, induced, disintegration, of, deuterium, nuclei, has, been, observed, in, the, sudbury, neutrino, observatory, which, uses, a, heavy, water, detector, there, are, three, known, types, flavors, of, neutrinos, electron, neutrino, e, muon, neutrino, and, tau, neutrino, named, after, their, partner, leptons, in, the, standard, model, see, table, at, right, the, current, best, measurement, of, the, number, of, neutrino, types, comes, from, observing, the, decay, of, the, z, boson, this, particle, can, decay, into, any, light, neutrino, and, its, antineutrino, and, the, more, available, types, of, light, neutrinos, the, shorter, the, lifetime, of, the, z, boson, measurements, of, the, z, lifetime, have, shown, that, three, light, neutrino, flavors, couple, to, the, z, the, correspondence, between, the, six, quarks, in, the, standard, model, and, the, six, leptons, among, them, the, three, neutrinos, suggests, to, physicists, intuition, that, there, should, be, exactly, three, types, of, neutrino, there, are, several, active, research, areas, involving, the, neutrino, with, aspirations, of, finding, international, scientific, collaborations, install, large, neutrino, detectors, near, nuclear, reactors, or, in, neutrino, beams, from, particle, accelerators, to, better, constrain, the, neutrino, masses, and, the, values, for, the, magnitude, and, rates, of, oscillations, between, neutrino, flavors, these, experiments, are, thereby, searching, for, the, existence, of, cp, violation, in, the, neutrino, sector, that, is, whether, or, not, the, laws, of, physics, treat, neutrinos, and, antineutrinos, differently, the, katrin, experiment, in, germany, began, to, acquire, data, in, june, 2018, to, determine, the, value, of, the, mass, of, the, electron, neutrino, with, other, approaches, to, this, problem, in, the, planning, stages, despite, their, tiny, masses, neutrinos, are, so, numerous, that, their, gravitational, force, can, influence, other, matter, in, the, universe, the, three, known, neutrino, flavors, are, the, only, candidates, for, dark, matter, that, are, experimentally, established, elementary, particles, specifically, they, would, be, hot, dark, matter, however, the, currently, known, neutrino, types, seem, to, be, essentially, ruled, out, as, a, substantial, proportion, of, dark, matter, based, on, observations, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, it, still, seems, plausible, that, heavier, sterile, neutrinos, might, compose, warm, dark, matter, if, they, exist, other, efforts, search, for, evidence, of, a, sterile, neutrino, a, fourth, neutrino, flavor, that, would, not, interact, with, matter, like, the, three, known, neutrino, flavors, the, possibility, of, sterile, neutrinos, is, unaffected, by, the, z, boson, decay, measurements, described, above, if, their, mass, is, greater, than, half, the, z, boson, s, mass, they, could, not, be, a, decay, product, therefore, to, be, consistent, with, not, having, been, detected, in, z, boson, decays, heavy, sterile, neutrinos, would, need, to, have, a, mass, of, at, least, 45, 6, gev, the, existence, of, such, particles, is, in, fact, hinted, by, experimental, data, from, the, lsnd, experiment, on, the, other, hand, the, currently, running, miniboone, experiment, suggested, that, sterile, neutrinos, are, not, required, to, explain, the, experimental, data, although, the, latest, research, into, this, area, is, on, going, and, anomalies, in, the, miniboone, data, may, allow, for, exotic, neutrino, types, including, sterile, neutrinos, a, re, analysis, of, reference, electron, spectra, data, from, the, institut, laue, langevin, in, 2011, has, also, hinted, at, a, fourth, light, sterile, neutrino, triggered, by, the, 2011, findings, several, experiments, at, very, short, distances, from, nuclear, reactors, have, searched, for, sterile, neutrinos, since, then, while, most, of, them, were, able, to, rule, out, the, existence, of, a, light, sterile, neutrino, the, combined, results, are, ambiguous, according, to, an, analysis, published, in, 2010, data, from, the, wilkinson, microwave, anisotropy, probe, of, the, cosmic, background, radiation, is, compatible, with, either, three, or, four, types, of, neutrinos, another, hypothesis, concerns, neutrinoless, double, beta, decay, which, if, it, exists, would, violate, lepton, number, conservation, searches, for, this, mechanism, are, underway, but, have, not, yet, found, evidence, for, it, if, they, were, to, then, what, are, now, called, antineutrinos, could, not, be, true, antiparticles, cosmic, ray, neutrino, experiments, detect, neutrinos, from, space, to, study, both, the, nature, of, neutrinos, and, the, cosmic, sources, producing, them, before, neutrinos, were, found, to, oscillate, they, were, generally, assumed, to, be, massless, propagating, at, the, speed, of, light, c, according, to, the, theory, of, special, relativity, the, question, of, neutrino, velocity, is, closely, related, to, their, mass, if, neutrinos, are, massless, they, must, travel, at, the, speed, of, light, and, if, they, have, mass, they, cannot, reach, the, speed, of, light, due, to, their, tiny, mass, the, predicted, speed, is, extremely, close, to, the, speed, of, light, in, all, experiments, and, current, detectors, are, not, sensitive, to, the, expected, difference, also, there, are, some, lorentz, violating, variants, of, quantum, gravity, which, might, allow, faster, than, light, neutrinos, a, comprehensive, framework, for, lorentz, violations, is, the, standard, model, extension, sme, the, first, measurements, of, neutrino, speed, were, made, in, the, early, 1980s, using, pulsed, pion, beams, produced, by, pulsed, proton, beams, hitting, a, target, the, pions, decayed, producing, neutrinos, and, the, neutrino, interactions, observed, within, a, time, window, in, a, detector, at, a, distance, were, consistent, with, the, speed, of, light, this, measurement, was, repeated, in, 2007, using, the, minos, detectors, which, found, the, speed, of, 3, gev, neutrinos, to, be, at, the, 99, confidence, level, in, the, range, between, 0, 999, 976, c, and, 1, 000, 126, c, the, central, value, of, 1, 000, 051, c, is, higher, than, the, speed, of, light, but, with, uncertainty, taken, into, account, is, also, consistent, with, a, velocity, of, exactly, c, or, slightly, less, this, measurement, set, an, upper, bound, on, the, mass, of, the, muon, neutrino, at, 50, mev, with, 99, confidence, after, the, detectors, for, the, project, were, upgraded, in, 2012, minos, refined, their, initial, result, and, found, agreement, with, the, speed, of, light, with, the, difference, in, the, arrival, time, of, neutrinos, and, light, of, 0, 0006, 0, 0012, a, similar, observation, was, made, on, a, much, larger, scale, with, supernova, 1987a, sn, 1987a, antineutrinos, with, an, energy, of, 10, mev, from, the, supernova, were, detected, within, a, time, window, that, was, consistent, with, the, speed, of, light, for, the, neutrinos, so, far, all, measurements, of, neutrino, speed, have, been, consistent, with, the, speed, of, light, in, september, 2011, the, opera, collaboration, released, calculations, showing, velocities, of, 17, gev, and, 28, gev, neutrinos, exceeding, the, speed, of, light, in, their, experiments, in, november, 2011, opera, repeated, its, experiment, with, changes, so, that, the, speed, could, be, determined, individually, for, each, detected, neutrino, the, results, showed, the, same, faster, than, light, speed, in, february, 2012, reports, came, out, that, the, results, may, have, been, caused, by, a, loose, fiber, optic, cable, attached, to, one, of, the, atomic, clocks, which, measured, the, departure, and, arrival, times, of, the, neutrinos, an, independent, recreation, of, the, experiment, in, the, same, laboratory, by, icarus, found, no, discernible, difference, between, the, speed, of, a, neutrino, and, the, speed, of, light, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, assumed, that, neutrinos, are, massless, the, experimentally, established, phenomenon, of, neutrino, oscillation, which, mixes, neutrino, flavor, states, with, neutrino, mass, states, analogously, to, ckm, mixing, requires, neutrinos, to, have, nonzero, masses, massive, neutrinos, were, originally, conceived, by, bruno, pontecorvo, in, the, 1950s, enhancing, the, basic, framework, to, accommodate, their, mass, is, straightforward, by, adding, a, right, handed, lagrangian, providing, for, neutrino, mass, can, be, done, in, two, ways, and, some, proposals, use, both, a, hard, upper, limit, on, the, masses, of, neutrinos, comes, from, cosmology, the, big, bang, model, predicts, that, there, is, a, fixed, ratio, between, the, number, of, neutrinos, and, the, number, of, photons, in, the, cosmic, microwave, background, if, the, total, mass, of, all, three, types, of, neutrinos, exceeded, an, average, of, 50, ev, c, 2, per, neutrino, there, would, be, so, much, mass, in, the, universe, that, it, would, collapse, this, limit, can, be, circumvented, by, assuming, that, the, neutrino, is, unstable, but, there, are, limits, within, the, standard, model, that, make, this, difficult, a, much, more, stringent, constraint, comes, from, a, careful, analysis, of, cosmological, data, such, as, the, cosmic, microwave, background, radiation, galaxy, surveys, and, the, lyman, alpha, forest, analysis, of, data, from, the, wmap, microwave, space, telescope, found, that, the, sum, of, the, masses, of, the, three, neutrino, species, must, be, less, than, 0, 3, ev, c, 2, in, 2018, the, planck, collaboration, published, a, stronger, bound, of, 0, 11, ev, c, 2, which, was, derived, by, combining, their, cmb, total, intensity, polarization, and, gravitational, lensing, observations, with, baryon, acoustic, oscillation, measurements, from, galaxy, surveys, and, supernova, measurements, from, pantheon, a, 2021, reanalysis, that, adds, redshift, space, distortion, measurements, from, the, sdss, iv, eboss, survey, gets, an, even, tighter, upper, limit, of, 0, 09, ev, c, 2, however, several, ground, based, telescopes, with, similarly, sized, error, bars, as, planck, prefer, higher, values, for, the, neutrino, mass, sum, indicating, some, tension, in, the, data, sets, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, 2015, was, awarded, to, takaaki, kajita, and, arthur, b, mcdonald, for, their, experimental, discovery, of, neutrino, oscillations, which, demonstrates, that, neutrinos, have, mass, in, 1998, research, results, at, the, super, kamiokande, neutrino, detector, determined, that, neutrinos, can, oscillate, from, one, flavor, to, another, which, requires, that, they, must, have, a, nonzero, mass, while, this, shows, that, neutrinos, have, mass, the, absolute, neutrino, mass, scale, is, still, not, known, this, is, because, neutrino, oscillations, are, sensitive, only, to, the, difference, in, the, squares, of, the, masses, as, of, 2020, the, best, fit, value, of, the, difference, of, the, squares, of, the, masses, of, mass, eigenstates, 1, and, 2, is, m, 2, 21, 0, 000, 074, ev, c, 2, 2, while, for, eigenstates, 2, and, 3, it, is, m, 2, 32, 0, 002, 51, ev, c, 2, 2, since, m, 2, 32, is, the, difference, of, two, squared, masses, at, least, one, of, them, must, have, a, value, that, is, at, least, the, square, root, of, this, value, thus, there, exists, at, least, one, neutrino, mass, eigenstate, with, a, mass, of, at, least, 0, 05, ev, c, 2, a, number, of, efforts, are, under, way, to, directly, determine, the, absolute, neutrino, mass, scale, in, laboratory, experiments, especially, using, nuclear, beta, decay, upper, limits, on, the, effective, electron, neutrino, masses, come, from, beta, decays, of, tritium, the, mainz, neutrino, mass, experiment, set, an, upper, limit, of, m, 2, 2, ev, c, 2, at, 95, confidence, level, since, june, 2018, the, katrin, experiment, searches, for, a, mass, between, 0, 2, ev, c, 2, and, 2, ev, c, 2, in, tritium, decays, the, february, 2022, upper, limit, is, m, 0, 8, ev, c, 2, at, 90, cl, in, combination, with, a, previous, campaign, by, katrin, from, 2019, on, 31, may, 2010, opera, researchers, observed, the, first, tau, neutrino, candidate, event, in, a, muon, neutrino, beam, the, first, time, this, transformation, in, neutrinos, had, been, observed, providing, further, evidence, that, they, have, mass, if, the, neutrino, is, a, majorana, particle, the, mass, may, be, calculated, by, finding, the, half, life, of, neutrinoless, double, beta, decay, of, certain, nuclei, the, current, lowest, upper, limit, on, the, majorana, mass, of, the, neutrino, has, been, set, by, kamland, zen, 0, 060, 0, 161, ev, c, 2, experimental, results, show, that, within, the, margin, of, error, all, produced, and, observed, neutrinos, have, left, handed, helicities, spins, antiparallel, to, momenta, and, all, antineutrinos, have, right, handed, helicities, in, the, massless, limit, that, means, that, only, one, of, two, possible, chiralities, is, observed, for, either, particle, these, are, the, only, chiralities, included, in, the, standard, model, of, particle, interactions, it, is, possible, that, their, counterparts, right, handed, neutrinos, and, left, handed, antineutrinos, simply, do, not, exist, if, they, do, exist, their, properties, are, substantially, different, from, observable, neutrinos, and, antineutrinos, it, is, theorized, that, they, are, either, very, heavy, on, the, order, of, gut, scale, see, seesaw, mechanism, do, not, participate, in, weak, interaction, so, called, sterile, neutrinos, or, both, the, existence, of, nonzero, neutrino, masses, somewhat, complicates, the, situation, neutrinos, are, produced, in, weak, interactions, as, chirality, eigenstates, chirality, of, a, massive, particle, is, not, a, constant, of, motion, helicity, is, but, the, chirality, operator, does, not, share, eigenstates, with, the, helicity, operator, free, neutrinos, propagate, as, mixtures, of, left, and, right, handed, helicity, states, with, mixing, amplitudes, on, the, order, of, m, e, this, does, not, significantly, affect, the, experiments, because, neutrinos, involved, are, nearly, always, ultrarelativistic, and, thus, mixing, amplitudes, are, vanishingly, small, effectively, they, travel, so, quickly, and, time, passes, so, slowly, in, their, rest, frames, that, they, do, not, have, enough, time, to, change, over, any, observable, path, for, example, most, solar, neutrinos, have, energies, on, the, order, of, 0, 100, mev, 1, 00, mev, consequently, the, fraction, of, neutrinos, with, wrong, helicity, among, them, cannot, exceed, 10, 10, an, unexpected, series, of, experimental, results, for, the, rate, of, decay, of, heavy, highly, charged, radioactive, ions, circulating, in, a, storage, ring, has, provoked, theoretical, activity, in, an, effort, to, find, a, convincing, explanation, the, observed, phenomenon, is, known, as, the, gsi, anomaly, as, the, storage, ring, is, a, facility, at, the, gsi, helmholtz, centre, for, heavy, ion, research, in, darmstadt, germany, the, rates, of, weak, decay, of, two, radioactive, species, with, half, lives, of, about, 40, seconds, and, 200, seconds, were, found, to, have, a, significant, oscillatory, modulation, with, a, period, of, about, 7, seconds, as, the, decay, process, produces, an, electron, neutrino, some, of, the, suggested, explanations, for, the, observed, oscillation, rate, propose, new, or, altered, neutrino, properties, ideas, related, to, flavor, oscillation, met, with, skepticism, a, later, proposal, is, based, on, differences, between, neutrino, mass, eigenstates, nuclear, reactors, are, the, major, source, of, human, generated, neutrinos, the, majority, of, energy, in, a, nuclear, reactor, is, generated, by, fission, the, four, main, fissile, isotopes, in, nuclear, reactors, are, 235, u, 238, u, 239, pu, and, 241, pu, the, resultant, neutron, rich, daughter, nuclides, rapidly, undergo, additional, beta, decays, each, converting, one, neutron, to, a, proton, and, an, electron, and, releasing, an, electron, antineutrino, including, these, subsequent, decays, the, average, nuclear, fission, releases, about, 200, mev, of, energy, of, which, roughly, 95, 5, remains, in, the, core, as, heat, and, roughly, 4, 5, or, about, 9, mev, is, radiated, away, as, antineutrinos, for, a, typical, nuclear, reactor, with, a, thermal, power, of, 4000, mw, the, total, power, production, from, fissioning, atoms, is, actually, 4185, mw, of, which, 185, mw, is, radiated, away, as, antineutrino, radiation, and, never, appears, in, the, engineering, this, is, to, say, 185, mw, of, fission, energy, is, lost, from, this, reactor, and, does, not, appear, as, heat, available, to, run, turbines, since, antineutrinos, penetrate, all, building, materials, practically, without, interaction, the, antineutrino, energy, spectrum, depends, on, the, degree, to, which, the, fuel, is, burned, plutonium, 239, fission, antineutrinos, on, average, have, slightly, more, energy, than, those, from, uranium, 235, fission, but, in, general, the, detectable, antineutrinos, from, fission, have, a, peak, energy, between, about, 3, 5, and, 4, mev, with, a, maximum, energy, of, about, 10, mev, there, is, no, established, experimental, method, to, measure, the, flux, of, low, energy, antineutrinos, only, antineutrinos, with, an, energy, above, threshold, of, 1, 8, mev, can, trigger, inverse, beta, decay, and, thus, be, unambiguously, identified, see, detection, below, an, estimated, 3, of, all, antineutrinos, from, a, nuclear, reactor, carry, an, energy, above, that, threshold, thus, an, average, nuclear, power, plant, may, generate, over, 10, 20, antineutrinos, per, second, above, the, threshold, but, also, a, much, larger, number, 97, 3, 30, times, this, number, below, the, energy, threshold, these, lower, energy, antineutrinos, are, invisible, to, present, detector, technology, some, particle, accelerators, have, been, used, to, make, neutrino, beams, the, technique, is, to, collide, protons, with, a, fixed, target, producing, charged, pions, or, kaons, these, unstable, particles, are, then, magnetically, focused, into, a, long, tunnel, where, they, decay, while, in, flight, because, of, the, relativistic, boost, of, the, decaying, particle, the, neutrinos, are, produced, as, a, beam, rather, than, isotropically, efforts, to, design, an, accelerator, facility, where, neutrinos, are, produced, through, muon, decays, are, ongoing, such, a, setup, is, generally, known, as, a, neutrino, factory, unlike, other, artificial, sources, colliders, produce, both, neutrinos, and, anti, neutrinos, of, all, flavors, at, very, high, energies, the, first, direct, observation, of, collider, neutrinos, was, reported, in, 2023, by, the, faser, experiment, at, the, large, hadron, collider, nuclear, weapons, also, produce, very, large, quantities, of, neutrinos, fred, reines, and, clyde, cowan, considered, the, detection, of, neutrinos, from, a, bomb, prior, to, their, search, for, reactor, neutrinos, a, fission, reactor, was, recommended, as, a, better, alternative, by, los, alamos, physics, division, leader, j, m, b, kellogg, fission, weapons, produce, antineutrinos, from, the, fission, process, and, fusion, weapons, produce, both, neutrinos, from, the, fusion, process, and, antineutrinos, from, the, initiating, fission, explosion, neutrinos, are, produced, together, with, the, natural, background, radiation, in, particular, the, decay, chains, of, 238, u, and, 232, th, isotopes, as, well, as, 40, k, include, beta, decays, which, emit, antineutrinos, these, so, called, geoneutrinos, can, provide, valuable, information, on, the, earth, s, interior, a, first, indication, for, geoneutrinos, was, found, by, the, kamland, experiment, in, 2005, updated, results, have, been, presented, by, kamland, and, borexino, the, main, background, in, the, geoneutrino, measurements, are, the, antineutrinos, coming, from, reactors, atmospheric, neutrinos, result, from, the, interaction, of, cosmic, rays, with, atomic, nuclei, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, creating, showers, of, particles, many, of, which, are, unstable, and, produce, neutrinos, when, they, decay, a, collaboration, of, particle, physicists, from, tata, institute, of, fundamental, research, india, osaka, city, university, japan, and, durham, university, uk, recorded, the, first, cosmic, ray, neutrino, interaction, in, an, underground, laboratory, in, kolar, gold, fields, in, india, in, 1965, solar, neutrinos, originate, from, the, nuclear, fusion, powering, the, sun, and, other, stars, the, details, of, the, operation, of, the, sun, are, explained, by, the, standard, solar, model, in, short, when, four, protons, fuse, to, become, one, helium, nucleus, two, of, them, have, to, convert, into, neutrons, and, each, such, conversion, releases, one, electron, neutrino, the, sun, sends, enormous, numbers, of, neutrinos, in, all, directions, each, second, about, 65, billion, 6, 5, 10, 10, solar, neutrinos, pass, through, every, square, centimeter, on, the, part, of, the, earth, orthogonal, to, the, direction, of, the, sun, since, neutrinos, are, insignificantly, absorbed, by, the, mass, of, the, earth, the, surface, area, on, the, side, of, the, earth, opposite, the, sun, receives, about, the, same, number, of, neutrinos, as, the, side, facing, the, sun, colgate, white, 1966, calculated, that, neutrinos, carry, away, most, of, the, gravitational, energy, released, during, the, collapse, of, massive, stars, events, now, categorized, as, type, ib, and, ic, and, type, ii, supernovae, when, such, stars, collapse, matter, densities, at, the, core, become, so, high, 10, 17, kg, m, 3, that, the, degeneracy, of, electrons, is, not, enough, to, prevent, protons, and, electrons, from, combining, to, form, a, neutron, and, an, electron, neutrino, mann, 1997, found, a, second, and, more, profuse, neutrino, source, is, the, thermal, energy, 100, billion, kelvins, of, the, newly, formed, neutron, core, which, is, dissipated, via, the, formation, of, neutrino, antineutrino, pairs, of, all, flavors, colgate, and, white, s, theory, of, supernova, neutrino, production, was, confirmed, in, 1987, when, neutrinos, from, supernova, 1987a, were, detected, the, water, based, detectors, kamiokande, ii, and, imb, detected, 11, and, 8, antineutrinos, lepton, number, 1, of, thermal, origin, respectively, while, the, scintillator, based, baksan, detector, found, 5, neutrinos, lepton, number, 1, of, either, thermal, or, electron, capture, origin, in, a, burst, less, than, 13, seconds, long, the, neutrino, signal, from, the, supernova, arrived, at, earth, several, hours, before, the, arrival, of, the, first, electromagnetic, radiation, as, expected, from, the, evident, fact, that, the, latter, emerges, along, with, the, shock, wave, the, exceptionally, feeble, interaction, with, normal, matter, allowed, the, neutrinos, to, pass, through, the, churning, mass, of, the, exploding, star, while, the, electromagnetic, photons, were, slowed, because, neutrinos, interact, so, little, with, matter, it, is, thought, that, a, supernova, s, neutrino, emissions, carry, information, about, the, innermost, regions, of, the, explosion, much, of, the, visible, light, comes, from, the, decay, of, radioactive, elements, produced, by, the, supernova, shock, wave, and, even, light, from, the, explosion, itself, is, scattered, by, dense, and, turbulent, gases, and, thus, delayed, the, neutrino, burst, is, expected, to, reach, earth, before, any, electromagnetic, waves, including, visible, light, gamma, rays, or, radio, waves, the, exact, time, delay, of, the, electromagnetic, waves, arrivals, depends, on, the, velocity, of, the, shock, wave, and, on, the, thickness, of, the, outer, layer, of, the, star, for, a, type, ii, supernova, astronomers, expect, the, neutrino, flood, to, be, released, seconds, after, the, stellar, core, collapse, while, the, first, electromagnetic, signal, may, emerge, hours, later, after, the, explosion, shock, wave, has, had, time, to, reach, the, surface, of, the, star, the, supernova, early, warning, system, project, uses, a, network, of, neutrino, detectors, to, monitor, the, sky, for, candidate, supernova, events, the, neutrino, signal, will, provide, a, useful, advance, warning, of, a, star, exploding, in, the, milky, way, although, neutrinos, pass, through, the, outer, gases, of, a, supernova, without, scattering, they, provide, information, about, the, deeper, supernova, core, with, evidence, that, here, even, neutrinos, scatter, to, a, significant, extent, in, a, supernova, core, the, densities, are, those, of, a, neutron, star, which, is, expected, to, be, formed, in, this, type, of, supernova, becoming, large, enough, to, influence, the, duration, of, the, neutrino, signal, by, delaying, some, neutrinos, the, 13, second, long, neutrino, signal, from, sn, 1987a, lasted, far, longer, than, it, would, take, for, unimpeded, neutrinos, to, cross, through, the, neutrino, generating, core, of, a, supernova, expected, to, be, only, 3, 200, kilometers, in, diameter, for, sn, 1987a, the, number, of, neutrinos, counted, was, also, consistent, with, a, total, neutrino, energy, of, 2, 2, 10, 46, joules, which, was, estimated, to, be, nearly, all, of, the, total, energy, of, the, supernova, for, an, average, supernova, approximately, 10, 57, an, octodecillion, neutrinos, are, released, but, the, actual, number, detected, at, a, terrestrial, detector, n, displaystyle, n, will, be, far, smaller, at, the, level, of, n, 10, 4, m, 25, k, t, o, n, 10, k, p, c, d, 2, displaystyle, n, sim, 10, 4, left, frac, m, 25, mathsf, kton, right, left, frac, 10, mathsf, kpc, d, right, 2, where, m, displaystyle, m, is, the, mass, of, the, detector, with, e, g, super, kamiokande, having, a, mass, of, 50, kton, and, d, displaystyle, d, is, the, distance, to, the, supernova, hence, in, practice, it, will, only, be, possible, to, detect, neutrino, bursts, from, supernovae, within, or, nearby, the, milky, way, our, own, galaxy, in, addition, to, the, detection, of, neutrinos, from, individual, supernovae, it, should, also, be, possible, to, detect, the, diffuse, supernova, neutrino, background, which, originates, from, all, supernovae, in, the, universe, the, energy, of, supernova, neutrinos, ranges, from, a, few, to, several, tens, of, mev, the, sites, where, cosmic, rays, are, accelerated, are, expected, to, produce, neutrinos, that, are, at, least, one, million, times, more, energetic, produced, from, turbulent, gaseous, environments, left, over, by, supernova, explosions, supernova, remnants, the, origin, of, the, cosmic, rays, was, attributed, to, supernovas, by, baade, and, zwicky, this, hypothesis, was, refined, by, ginzburg, and, syrovatsky, who, attributed, the, origin, to, supernova, remnants, and, supported, their, claim, by, the, crucial, remark, that, the, cosmic, ray, losses, of, the, milky, way, is, compensated, if, the, efficiency, of, acceleration, in, supernova, remnants, is, about, 10, percent, ginzburg, and, syrovatskii, s, hypothesis, is, supported, by, the, specific, mechanism, of, shock, wave, acceleration, happening, in, supernova, remnants, which, is, consistent, with, the, original, theoretical, picture, drawn, by, enrico, fermi, and, is, receiving, support, from, observational, data, the, very, high, energy, neutrinos, are, still, to, be, seen, but, this, branch, of, neutrino, astronomy, is, just, in, its, infancy, the, main, existing, or, forthcoming, experiments, that, aim, at, observing, very, high, energy, neutrinos, from, our, galaxy, are, baikal, amanda, icecube, antares, nemo, and, nestor, related, information, is, provided, by, very, high, energy, gamma, ray, observatories, such, as, veritas, hess, and, magic, indeed, the, collisions, of, cosmic, rays, are, supposed, to, produce, charged, pions, whose, decay, give, the, neutrinos, neutral, pions, and, gamma, rays, the, environment, of, a, supernova, remnant, which, is, transparent, to, both, types, of, radiation, still, higher, energy, neutrinos, resulting, from, the, interactions, of, extragalactic, cosmic, rays, could, be, observed, with, the, pierre, auger, observatory, or, with, the, dedicated, experiment, named, anita, it, is, thought, that, just, like, the, cosmic, microwave, background, radiation, leftover, from, the, big, bang, there, is, a, background, of, low, energy, neutrinos, in, our, universe, in, the, 1980s, it, was, proposed, that, these, may, be, the, explanation, for, the, dark, matter, thought, to, exist, in, the, universe, neutrinos, have, one, important, advantage, over, most, other, dark, matter, candidates, they, are, known, to, exist, this, idea, also, has, serious, problems, from, particle, experiments, it, is, known, that, neutrinos, are, very, light, this, means, that, they, easily, move, at, speeds, close, to, the, speed, of, light, for, this, reason, dark, matter, made, from, neutrinos, is, termed, hot, dark, matter, the, problem, is, that, being, fast, moving, the, neutrinos, would, tend, to, have, spread, out, evenly, in, the, universe, before, cosmological, expansion, made, them, cold, enough, to, congregate, in, clumps, this, would, cause, the, part, of, dark, matter, made, of, neutrinos, to, be, smeared, out, and, unable, to, cause, the, large, galactic, structures, that, we, see, these, same, galaxies, and, groups, of, galaxies, appear, to, be, surrounded, by, dark, matter, that, is, not, fast, enough, to, escape, from, those, galaxies, presumably, this, matter, provided, the, gravitational, nucleus, for, formation, this, implies, that, neutrinos, cannot, make, up, a, significant, part, of, the, total, amount, of, dark, matter, from, cosmological, arguments, relic, background, neutrinos, are, estimated, to, have, density, of, 56, of, each, type, per, cubic, centimeter, and, temperature, 1, 9, k, 1, 7, 10, 4, ev, if, they, are, massless, much, colder, if, their, mass, exceeds, 0, 001, ev, c, 2, although, their, density, is, quite, high, they, have, not, yet, been, observed, in, the, laboratory, as, their, energy, is, below, thresholds, of, most, detection, methods, and, due, to, extremely, low, neutrino, interaction, cross, sections, at, sub, ev, energies, in, contrast, boron, 8, solar, neutrinos, which, are, emitted, with, a, higher, energy, have, been, detected, definitively, despite, having, a, space, density, that, is, lower, than, that, of, relic, neutrinos, by, some, six, orders, of, magnitude, neutrinos, cannot, be, detected, directly, because, they, do, not, carry, electric, charge, which, means, they, do, not, ionize, the, materials, they, pass, through, other, ways, neutrinos, might, affect, their, environment, such, as, the, msw, effect, do, not, produce, traceable, radiation, a, unique, reaction, to, identify, antineutrinos, sometimes, referred, to, as, inverse, beta, decay, as, applied, by, reines, and, cowan, see, below, requires, a, very, large, detector, to, detect, a, significant, number, of, neutrinos, all, detection, methods, require, the, neutrinos, to, carry, a, minimum, threshold, energy, so, far, there, is, no, detection, method, for, low, energy, neutrinos, in, the, sense, that, potential, neutrino, interactions, for, example, by, the, msw, effect, cannot, be, uniquely, distinguished, from, other, causes, neutrino, detectors, are, often, built, underground, to, isolate, the, detector, from, cosmic, rays, and, other, background, radiation, antineutrinos, were, first, detected, in, the, 1950s, near, a, nuclear, reactor, reines, and, cowan, used, two, targets, containing, a, solution, of, cadmium, chloride, in, water, two, scintillation, detectors, were, placed, next, to, the, cadmium, targets, antineutrinos, with, an, energy, above, the, threshold, of, 1, 8, mev, caused, charged, current, interactions, with, the, protons, in, the, water, producing, positrons, and, neutrons, this, is, very, much, like, decay, where, energy, is, used, to, convert, a, proton, into, a, neutron, a, positron, e, and, an, electron, neutrino, e, is, emitted, from, known, decay, in, the, cowan, and, reines, experiment, instead, of, an, outgoing, neutrino, you, have, an, incoming, antineutrino, e, from, a, nuclear, reactor, the, resulting, positron, annihilation, with, electrons, in, the, detector, material, created, photons, with, an, energy, of, about, 0, 5, mev, pairs, of, photons, in, coincidence, could, be, detected, by, the, two, scintillation, detectors, above, and, below, the, target, the, neutrons, were, captured, by, cadmium, nuclei, resulting, in, gamma, rays, of, about, 8, mev, that, were, detected, a, few, microseconds, after, the, photons, from, a, positron, annihilation, event, since, then, various, detection, methods, have, been, used, super, kamiokande, is, a, large, volume, of, water, surrounded, by, photomultiplier, tubes, that, watch, for, the, cherenkov, radiation, emitted, when, an, incoming, neutrino, creates, an, electron, or, muon, in, the, water, the, sudbury, neutrino, observatory, is, similar, but, used, heavy, water, as, the, detecting, medium, which, uses, the, same, effects, but, also, allows, the, additional, reaction, any, flavor, neutrino, photo, dissociation, of, deuterium, resulting, in, a, free, neutron, which, is, then, detected, from, gamma, radiation, after, chlorine, capture, other, detectors, have, consisted, of, large, volumes, of, chlorine, or, gallium, which, are, periodically, checked, for, excesses, of, argon, or, germanium, respectively, which, are, created, by, electron, neutrinos, interacting, with, the, original, substance, minos, used, a, solid, plastic, scintillator, coupled, to, photomultiplier, tubes, while, borexino, uses, a, liquid, pseudocumene, scintillator, also, watched, by, photomultiplier, tubes, and, the, no, a, detector, uses, liquid, scintillator, watched, by, avalanche, photodiodes, the, icecube, neutrino, observatory, uses, 1, km, 3, of, the, antarctic, ice, sheet, near, the, south, pole, with, photomultiplier, tubes, distributed, throughout, the, volume, neutrinos, low, mass, and, neutral, charge, mean, they, interact, exceedingly, weakly, with, other, particles, and, fields, this, feature, of, weak, interaction, interests, scientists, because, it, means, neutrinos, can, be, used, to, probe, environments, that, other, radiation, such, as, light, or, radio, waves, cannot, penetrate, using, neutrinos, as, a, probe, was, first, proposed, in, the, mid, 20th, century, as, a, way, to, detect, conditions, at, the, core, of, the, sun, the, solar, core, cannot, be, imaged, directly, because, electromagnetic, radiation, such, as, light, is, diffused, by, the, great, amount, and, density, of, matter, surrounding, the, core, on, the, other, hand, neutrinos, pass, through, the, sun, with, few, interactions, whereas, photons, emitted, from, the, solar, core, may, require, 40, 000, years, to, diffuse, to, the, outer, layers, of, the, sun, neutrinos, generated, in, stellar, fusion, reactions, at, the, core, cross, this, distance, practically, unimpeded, at, nearly, the, speed, of, light, neutrinos, are, also, useful, for, probing, astrophysical, sources, beyond, the, solar, system, because, they, are, the, only, known, particles, that, are, not, significantly, attenuated, by, their, travel, through, the, interstellar, medium, optical, photons, can, be, obscured, or, diffused, by, dust, gas, and, background, radiation, high, energy, cosmic, rays, in, the, form, of, swift, protons, and, atomic, nuclei, are, unable, to, travel, more, than, about, 100, megaparsecs, due, to, the, greisen, zatsepin, kuzmin, limit, gzk, cutoff, neutrinos, in, contrast, can, travel, even, greater, distances, barely, attenuated, the, galactic, core, of, the, milky, way, is, fully, obscured, by, dense, gas, and, numerous, bright, objects, neutrinos, produced, in, the, galactic, core, might, be, measurable, by, earth, based, neutrino, telescopes, another, important, use, of, the, neutrino, is, in, the, observation, of, supernovae, the, explosions, that, end, the, lives, of, highly, massive, stars, the, core, collapse, phase, of, a, supernova, is, an, extremely, dense, and, energetic, event, it, is, so, dense, that, no, known, particles, are, able, to, escape, the, advancing, core, front, except, for, neutrinos, consequently, supernovae, are, known, to, release, approximately, 99, of, their, radiant, energy, in, a, short, 10, second, burst, of, neutrinos, these, neutrinos, are, a, very, useful, probe, for, core, collapse, studies, the, rest, mass, of, the, neutrino, is, an, important, test, of, cosmological, and, astrophysical, theories, the, neutrino, s, significance, in, probing, cosmological, phenomena, is, as, great, as, any, other, method, and, is, thus, a, major, focus, of, study, in, astrophysical, communities, the, study, of, neutrinos, is, important, in, particle, physics, because, neutrinos, typically, have, the, lowest, rest, mass, among, massive, particles, i, e, the, lowest, non, zero, rest, mass, i, e, excluding, the, zero, rest, mass, of, photons, and, gluons, and, hence, are, examples, of, the, lowest, energy, massive, particles, theorized, in, extensions, of, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, in, november, 2012, american, scientists, used, a, particle, accelerator, to, send, a, coherent, neutrino, message, through, 780, feet, of, rock, this, marks, the, first, use, of, neutrinos, for, communication, and, future, research, may, permit, binary, neutrino, messages, to, be, sent, immense, distances, through, even, the, densest, materials, such, as, the, earth, s, core, in, july, 2018, the, icecube, neutrino, observatory, announced, that, they, have, traced, an, extremely, high, energy, neutrino, that, hit, their, antarctica, based, research, station, in, september, 2017, back, to, its, point, of, origin, in, the, blazar, txs, 0506, 056, located, 3, 7, billion, light, years, away, in, the, direction, of, the, constellation, orion, this, is, the, first, time, that, a, neutrino, detector, has, been, used, to, locate, an, object, in, space, and, that, a, source, of, cosmic, rays, has, been, identified, in, november, 2022, the, icecube, neutrino, observatory, found, evidence, of, high, energy, neutrino, emission, from, ngc, 1068, also, known, as, messier, 77, an, active, galaxy, in, the, constellation, cetus, and, one, of, the, most, familiar, and, well, studied, galaxies, to, date, in, june, 2023, astronomers, reported, using, a, new, technique, to, detect, for, the, first, time, the, release, of, neutrinos, from, the, galactic, plane, of, the, milky, way, galaxy
