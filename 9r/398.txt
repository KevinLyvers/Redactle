iodine, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, i, and, atomic, number, 53, the, heaviest, of, the, stable, halogens, it, exists, at, standard, conditions, as, a, semi, lustrous, non, metallic, solid, that, melts, to, form, a, deep, violet, liquid, at, 114, c, 237, f, and, boils, to, a, violet, gas, at, 184, c, 363, f, the, element, was, discovered, by, the, french, chemist, bernard, courtois, in, 1811, and, was, named, two, years, later, by, joseph, louis, gay, lussac, after, the, ancient, greek, meaning, violet, iodine, occurs, in, many, oxidation, states, including, iodide, i, iodate, io, 3, and, the, various, periodate, anions, as, the, heaviest, essential, mineral, nutrient, iodine, is, required, for, the, synthesis, of, thyroid, hormones, iodine, deficiency, affects, about, two, billion, people, and, is, the, leading, preventable, cause, of, intellectual, disabilities, the, dominant, producers, of, iodine, today, are, chile, and, japan, due, to, its, high, atomic, number, and, ease, of, attachment, to, organic, compounds, it, has, also, found, favour, as, a, non, toxic, radiocontrast, material, because, of, the, specificity, of, its, uptake, by, the, human, body, radioactive, isotopes, of, iodine, can, also, be, used, to, treat, thyroid, cancer, iodine, is, also, used, as, a, catalyst, in, the, industrial, production, of, acetic, acid, and, some, polymers, it, is, on, the, world, health, organization, s, list, of, essential, medicines, in, 1811, iodine, was, discovered, by, french, chemist, bernard, courtois, who, was, born, to, a, family, of, manufacturers, of, saltpetre, an, essential, component, of, gunpowder, at, the, time, of, the, napoleonic, wars, saltpetre, was, in, great, demand, in, france, saltpetre, produced, from, french, nitre, beds, required, sodium, carbonate, which, could, be, isolated, from, seaweed, collected, on, the, coasts, of, normandy, and, brittany, to, isolate, the, sodium, carbonate, seaweed, was, burned, and, the, ash, washed, with, water, the, remaining, waste, was, destroyed, by, adding, sulfuric, acid, courtois, once, added, excessive, sulfuric, acid, and, a, cloud, of, violet, vapour, rose, he, noted, that, the, vapour, crystallised, on, cold, surfaces, making, dark, black, crystals, courtois, suspected, that, this, material, was, a, new, element, but, lacked, funding, to, pursue, it, further, courtois, gave, samples, to, his, friends, charles, bernard, desormes, 1777, 1838, and, nicolas, cl, ment, 1779, 1841, to, continue, research, he, also, gave, some, of, the, substance, to, chemist, joseph, louis, gay, lussac, 1778, 1850, and, to, physicist, andr, marie, amp, re, 1775, 1836, on, 29, november, 1813, desormes, and, cl, ment, made, courtois, discovery, public, by, describing, the, substance, to, a, meeting, of, the, imperial, institute, of, france, on, 6, december, 1813, gay, lussac, found, and, announced, that, the, new, substance, was, either, an, element, or, a, compound, of, oxygen, and, he, found, that, it, is, an, element, gay, lussac, suggested, the, name, iode, anglicized, as, iodine, from, the, ancient, greek, iod, s, violet, because, of, the, colour, of, iodine, vapor, amp, re, had, given, some, of, his, sample, to, british, chemist, humphry, davy, 1778, 1829, who, experimented, on, the, substance, and, noted, its, similarity, to, chlorine, and, also, found, it, as, an, element, davy, sent, a, letter, dated, 10, december, to, the, royal, society, of, london, stating, that, he, had, identified, a, new, element, called, iodine, arguments, erupted, between, davy, and, gay, lussac, over, who, identified, iodine, first, but, both, scientists, found, that, both, of, them, identified, iodine, first, and, also, knew, that, courtois, is, the, first, one, to, isolate, the, element, in, 1873, the, french, medical, researcher, casimir, davaine, 1812, 1882, discovered, the, antiseptic, action, of, iodine, antonio, grossich, 1849, 1926, an, istrian, born, surgeon, was, among, the, first, to, use, sterilisation, of, the, operative, field, in, 1908, he, introduced, tincture, of, iodine, as, a, way, to, rapidly, sterilise, the, human, skin, in, the, surgical, field, in, early, periodic, tables, iodine, was, often, given, the, symbol, j, for, jod, its, name, in, german, in, german, texts, j, is, still, frequently, used, in, place, of, i, iodine, is, the, fourth, halogen, being, a, member, of, group, 17, in, the, periodic, table, below, fluorine, chlorine, and, bromine, since, astatine, and, tennessine, are, radioactive, iodine, is, the, heaviest, stable, halogen, iodine, has, an, electron, configuration, of, 4d, 10, 5s, 2, 5p, 5, with, the, seven, electrons, in, the, fifth, and, outermost, shell, being, its, valence, electrons, like, the, other, halogens, it, is, one, electron, short, of, a, full, octet, and, is, hence, an, oxidising, agent, reacting, with, many, elements, in, order, to, complete, its, outer, shell, although, in, keeping, with, periodic, trends, it, is, the, weakest, oxidising, agent, among, the, stable, halogens, it, has, the, lowest, electronegativity, among, them, just, 2, 66, on, the, pauling, scale, compare, fluorine, chlorine, and, bromine, at, 3, 98, 3, 16, and, 2, 96, respectively, astatine, continues, the, trend, with, an, electronegativity, of, 2, 2, elemental, iodine, hence, forms, diatomic, molecules, with, chemical, formula, i, 2, where, two, iodine, atoms, share, a, pair, of, electrons, in, order, to, each, achieve, a, stable, octet, for, themselves, at, high, temperatures, these, diatomic, molecules, reversibly, dissociate, a, pair, of, iodine, atoms, similarly, the, iodide, anion, i, is, the, strongest, reducing, agent, among, the, stable, halogens, being, the, most, easily, oxidised, back, to, diatomic, i, 2, astatine, goes, further, being, indeed, unstable, as, at, and, readily, oxidised, to, at, 0, or, at, the, halogens, darken, in, colour, as, the, group, is, descended, fluorine, is, a, very, pale, yellow, chlorine, is, greenish, yellow, bromine, is, reddish, brown, and, iodine, is, violet, elemental, iodine, is, slightly, soluble, in, water, with, one, gram, dissolving, in, 3450, ml, at, 20, c, and, 1280, ml, at, 50, c, potassium, iodide, may, be, added, to, increase, solubility, via, formation, of, triiodide, ions, among, other, polyiodides, nonpolar, solvents, such, as, hexane, and, carbon, tetrachloride, provide, a, higher, solubility, polar, solutions, such, as, aqueous, solutions, are, brown, reflecting, the, role, of, these, solvents, as, lewis, bases, on, the, other, hand, nonpolar, solutions, are, violet, the, color, of, iodine, vapour, charge, transfer, complexes, form, when, iodine, is, dissolved, in, polar, solvents, hence, changing, the, colour, iodine, is, violet, when, dissolved, in, carbon, tetrachloride, and, saturated, hydrocarbons, but, deep, brown, in, alcohols, and, amines, solvents, that, form, charge, transfer, adducts, the, melting, and, boiling, points, of, iodine, are, the, highest, among, the, halogens, conforming, to, the, increasing, trend, down, the, group, since, iodine, has, the, largest, electron, cloud, among, them, that, is, the, most, easily, polarised, resulting, in, its, molecules, having, the, strongest, van, der, waals, interactions, among, the, halogens, similarly, iodine, is, the, least, volatile, of, the, halogens, though, the, solid, still, can, be, observed, to, give, off, purple, vapor, due, to, this, property, iodine, is, commonly, used, to, demonstrate, sublimation, directly, from, solid, to, gas, which, gives, rise, to, a, misconception, that, it, does, not, melt, in, atmospheric, pressure, because, it, has, the, largest, atomic, radius, among, the, halogens, iodine, has, the, lowest, first, ionisation, energy, lowest, electron, affinity, lowest, electronegativity, and, lowest, reactivity, of, the, halogens, the, interhalogen, bond, in, diiodine, is, the, weakest, of, all, the, halogens, as, such, 1, of, a, sample, of, gaseous, iodine, at, atmospheric, pressure, is, dissociated, into, iodine, atoms, at, 575, c, temperatures, greater, than, 750, c, are, required, for, fluorine, chlorine, and, bromine, to, dissociate, to, a, similar, extent, most, bonds, to, iodine, are, weaker, than, the, analogous, bonds, to, the, lighter, halogens, gaseous, iodine, is, composed, of, i, 2, molecules, with, an, i, i, bond, length, of, 266, 6, pm, the, i, i, bond, is, one, of, the, longest, single, bonds, known, it, is, even, longer, 271, 5, pm, in, solid, orthorhombic, crystalline, iodine, which, has, the, same, crystal, structure, as, chlorine, and, bromine, the, record, is, held, by, iodine, s, neighbour, xenon, the, xe, xe, bond, length, is, 308, 71, pm, as, such, within, the, iodine, molecule, significant, electronic, interactions, occur, with, the, two, next, nearest, neighbours, of, each, atom, and, these, interactions, give, rise, in, bulk, iodine, to, a, shiny, appearance, and, semiconducting, properties, iodine, is, a, two, dimensional, semiconductor, with, a, band, gap, of, 1, 3, ev, 125, kj, mol, it, is, a, semiconductor, in, the, plane, of, its, crystalline, layers, and, an, insulator, in, the, perpendicular, direction, of, the, forty, known, isotopes, of, iodine, only, one, occurs, in, nature, iodine, 127, the, others, are, radioactive, and, have, half, lives, too, short, to, be, primordial, as, such, iodine, is, both, monoisotopic, and, mononuclidic, and, its, atomic, weight, is, known, to, great, precision, as, it, is, a, constant, of, nature, the, longest, lived, of, the, radioactive, isotopes, of, iodine, is, iodine, 129, which, has, a, half, life, of, 15, 7, million, years, decaying, via, beta, decay, to, stable, xenon, 129, some, iodine, 129, was, formed, along, with, iodine, 127, before, the, formation, of, the, solar, system, but, it, has, by, now, completely, decayed, away, making, it, an, extinct, radionuclide, its, former, presence, may, be, determined, from, an, excess, of, its, daughter, xenon, 129, but, early, attempts, to, use, this, characteristic, to, date, the, supernova, source, for, elements, in, the, solar, system, are, made, difficult, by, alternative, nuclear, processes, giving, iodine, 129, and, by, iodine, s, volatility, at, higher, temperatures, due, to, its, mobility, in, the, environment, iodine, 129, has, been, used, to, date, very, old, groundwaters, traces, of, iodine, 129, still, exist, today, as, it, is, also, a, cosmogenic, nuclide, formed, from, cosmic, ray, spallation, of, atmospheric, xenon, these, traces, make, up, 10, 14, to, 10, 10, of, all, terrestrial, iodine, it, also, occurs, from, open, air, nuclear, testing, and, is, not, hazardous, because, of, its, very, long, half, life, the, longest, of, all, fission, products, at, the, peak, of, thermonuclear, testing, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, iodine, 129, still, made, up, only, about, 10, 7, of, all, terrestrial, iodine, excited, states, of, iodine, 127, and, iodine, 129, are, often, used, in, m, ssbauer, spectroscopy, the, other, iodine, radioisotopes, have, much, shorter, half, lives, no, longer, than, days, some, of, them, have, medical, applications, involving, the, thyroid, gland, where, the, iodine, that, enters, the, body, is, stored, and, concentrated, iodine, 123, has, a, half, life, of, thirteen, hours, and, decays, by, electron, capture, to, tellurium, 123, emitting, gamma, radiation, it, is, used, in, nuclear, medicine, imaging, including, single, photon, emission, computed, tomography, spect, and, x, ray, computed, tomography, x, ray, ct, scans, iodine, 125, has, a, half, life, of, fifty, nine, days, decaying, by, electron, capture, to, tellurium, 125, and, emitting, low, energy, gamma, radiation, the, second, longest, lived, iodine, radioisotope, it, has, uses, in, biological, assays, nuclear, medicine, imaging, and, in, radiation, therapy, as, brachytherapy, to, treat, a, number, of, conditions, including, prostate, cancer, uveal, melanomas, and, brain, tumours, finally, iodine, 131, with, a, half, life, of, eight, days, beta, decays, to, an, excited, state, of, stable, xenon, 131, that, then, converts, to, the, ground, state, by, emitting, gamma, radiation, it, is, a, common, fission, product, and, thus, is, present, in, high, levels, in, radioactive, fallout, it, may, then, be, absorbed, through, contaminated, food, and, will, also, accumulate, in, the, thyroid, as, it, decays, it, may, cause, damage, to, the, thyroid, the, primary, risk, from, exposure, to, high, levels, of, iodine, 131, is, the, chance, occurrence, of, radiogenic, thyroid, cancer, in, later, life, other, risks, include, the, possibility, of, non, cancerous, growths, and, thyroiditis, protection, usually, used, against, the, negative, effects, of, iodine, 131, is, by, saturating, the, thyroid, gland, with, stable, iodine, 127, in, the, form, of, potassium, iodide, tablets, taken, daily, for, optimal, prophylaxis, however, iodine, 131, may, also, be, used, for, medicinal, purposes, in, radiation, therapy, for, this, very, reason, when, tissue, destruction, is, desired, after, iodine, uptake, by, the, tissue, iodine, 131, is, also, used, as, a, radioactive, tracer, iodine, is, quite, reactive, but, it, is, much, less, reactive, than, the, other, halogens, for, example, while, chlorine, gas, will, halogenate, carbon, monoxide, nitric, oxide, and, sulfur, dioxide, to, phosgene, nitrosyl, chloride, and, sulfuryl, chloride, respectively, iodine, will, not, do, so, furthermore, iodination, of, metals, tends, to, result, in, lower, oxidation, states, than, chlorination, or, bromination, for, example, rhenium, metal, reacts, with, chlorine, to, form, rhenium, hexachloride, but, with, bromine, it, forms, only, rhenium, pentabromide, and, iodine, can, achieve, only, rhenium, tetraiodide, by, the, same, token, however, since, iodine, has, the, lowest, ionisation, energy, among, the, halogens, and, is, the, most, easily, oxidised, of, them, it, has, a, more, significant, cationic, chemistry, and, its, higher, oxidation, states, are, rather, more, stable, than, those, of, bromine, and, chlorine, for, example, in, iodine, heptafluoride, the, iodine, molecule, i, 2, dissolves, in, ccl, 4, and, aliphatic, hydrocarbons, to, give, bright, violet, solutions, in, these, solvents, the, absorption, band, maximum, occurs, in, the, 520, 540, nm, region, and, is, assigned, to, a, to, transition, when, i, 2, reacts, with, lewis, bases, in, these, solvents, a, blue, shift, in, i, 2, peak, is, seen, and, the, new, peak, 230, 330, nm, arises, that, is, due, to, the, formation, of, adducts, which, are, referred, to, as, charge, transfer, complexes, the, simplest, compound, of, iodine, is, hydrogen, iodide, hi, it, is, a, colourless, gas, that, reacts, with, oxygen, to, give, water, and, iodine, although, it, is, useful, in, iodination, reactions, in, the, laboratory, it, does, not, have, large, scale, industrial, uses, unlike, the, other, hydrogen, halides, commercially, it, is, usually, made, by, reacting, iodine, with, hydrogen, sulfide, or, hydrazine, at, room, temperature, it, is, a, colourless, gas, like, all, of, the, hydrogen, halides, except, hydrogen, fluoride, since, hydrogen, cannot, form, strong, hydrogen, bonds, to, the, large, and, only, mildly, electronegative, iodine, atom, it, melts, at, 51, 0, c, 59, 8, f, and, boils, at, 35, 1, c, 31, 2, f, it, is, an, endothermic, compound, that, can, exothermically, dissociate, at, room, temperature, although, the, process, is, very, slow, unless, a, catalyst, is, present, the, reaction, between, hydrogen, and, iodine, at, room, temperature, to, give, hydrogen, iodide, does, not, proceed, to, completion, the, h, i, bond, dissociation, energy, is, likewise, the, smallest, of, the, hydrogen, halides, at, 295, kj, mol, aqueous, hydrogen, iodide, is, known, as, hydroiodic, acid, which, is, a, strong, acid, hydrogen, iodide, is, exceptionally, soluble, in, water, one, litre, of, water, will, dissolve, 425, litres, of, hydrogen, iodide, and, the, saturated, solution, has, only, four, water, molecules, per, molecule, of, hydrogen, iodide, commercial, so, called, concentrated, hydroiodic, acid, usually, contains, 48, 57, hi, by, mass, the, solution, forms, an, azeotrope, with, boiling, point, 126, 7, c, 260, 1, f, at, 56, 7, g, hi, per, 100, g, solution, hence, hydroiodic, acid, cannot, be, concentrated, past, this, point, by, evaporation, of, water, unlike, gaseous, hydrogen, iodide, hydroiodic, acid, has, major, industrial, use, in, the, manufacture, of, acetic, acid, by, the, cativa, process, unlike, hydrogen, fluoride, anhydrous, liquid, hydrogen, iodide, is, difficult, to, work, with, as, a, solvent, because, its, boiling, point, is, low, it, has, a, small, liquid, range, its, permittivity, is, low, and, it, does, not, dissociate, appreciably, into, h, 2, i, and, hi, 2, ions, the, latter, in, any, case, are, much, less, stable, than, the, bifluoride, ions, hf, 2, due, to, the, very, weak, hydrogen, bonding, between, hydrogen, and, iodine, though, its, salts, with, very, large, and, weakly, polarising, cations, such, as, cs, and, nr, 4, r, me, et, bu, n, may, still, be, isolated, anhydrous, hydrogen, iodide, is, a, poor, solvent, able, to, dissolve, only, small, molecular, compounds, such, as, nitrosyl, chloride, and, phenol, or, salts, with, very, low, lattice, energies, such, as, tetraalkylammonium, halides, with, the, exception, of, the, noble, gases, nearly, all, elements, on, the, periodic, table, up, to, einsteinium, esi, 3, is, known, are, known, to, form, binary, compounds, with, iodine, until, 1990, nitrogen, triiodide, was, only, known, as, an, ammonia, adduct, ammonia, free, ni, 3, was, found, to, be, isolable, at, 196, c, but, spontaneously, decomposes, at, 0, c, for, thermodynamic, reasons, related, to, electronegativity, of, the, elements, neutral, sulfur, and, selenium, iodides, that, are, stable, at, room, temperature, are, also, nonexistent, although, s, 2, i, 2, and, si, 2, are, stable, up, to, 183, and, 9, k, respectively, as, of, 2022, no, neutral, binary, selenium, iodide, has, been, unambiguously, identified, at, any, temperature, sulfur, and, selenium, iodine, polyatomic, cations, e, g, 2, and, 2, have, been, prepared, and, characterized, crystallographically, given, the, large, size, of, the, iodide, anion, and, iodine, s, weak, oxidising, power, high, oxidation, states, are, difficult, to, achieve, in, binary, iodides, the, maximum, known, being, in, the, pentaiodides, of, niobium, tantalum, and, protactinium, iodides, can, be, made, by, reaction, of, an, element, or, its, oxide, hydroxide, or, carbonate, with, hydroiodic, acid, and, then, dehydrated, by, mildly, high, temperatures, combined, with, either, low, pressure, or, anhydrous, hydrogen, iodide, gas, these, methods, work, best, when, the, iodide, product, is, stable, to, hydrolysis, other, syntheses, include, high, temperature, oxidative, iodination, of, the, element, with, iodine, or, hydrogen, iodide, high, temperature, iodination, of, a, metal, oxide, or, other, halide, by, iodine, a, volatile, metal, halide, carbon, tetraiodide, or, an, organic, iodide, for, example, molybdenum, iv, oxide, reacts, with, aluminium, iii, iodide, at, 230, c, to, give, molybdenum, ii, iodide, an, example, involving, halogen, exchange, is, given, below, involving, the, reaction, of, tantalum, v, chloride, with, excess, aluminium, iii, iodide, at, 400, c, to, give, tantalum, v, iodide, 3, tacl, 5, 5, ali, 3, excess, 3, tai, 5, 5, alcl, 3, displaystyle, ce, 3tacl5, underset, excess, 5ali3, 3tai5, 5alcl3, lower, iodides, may, be, produced, either, through, thermal, decomposition, or, disproportionation, or, by, reducing, the, higher, iodide, with, hydrogen, or, a, metal, for, example, tai, 5, ta, 630, c, 575, c, thermal, gradient, ta, 6, i, 14, displaystyle, ce, tai5, ta, ta6i14, most, metal, iodides, with, the, metal, in, low, oxidation, states, 1, to, 3, are, ionic, nonmetals, tend, to, form, covalent, molecular, iodides, as, do, metals, in, high, oxidation, states, from, 3, and, above, both, ionic, and, covalent, iodides, are, known, for, metals, in, oxidation, state, 3, e, g, scandium, iodide, is, mostly, ionic, but, aluminium, iodide, is, not, ionic, iodides, mi, n, tend, to, have, the, lowest, melting, and, boiling, points, among, the, halides, mx, n, of, the, same, element, because, the, electrostatic, forces, of, attraction, between, the, cations, and, anions, are, weakest, for, the, large, iodide, anion, in, contrast, covalent, iodides, tend, to, instead, have, the, highest, melting, and, boiling, points, among, the, halides, of, the, same, element, since, iodine, is, the, most, polarisable, of, the, halogens, and, having, the, most, electrons, among, them, can, contribute, the, most, to, van, der, waals, forces, naturally, exceptions, abound, in, intermediate, iodides, where, one, trend, gives, way, to, the, other, similarly, solubilities, in, water, of, predominantly, ionic, iodides, e, g, potassium, and, calcium, are, the, greatest, among, ionic, halides, of, that, element, while, those, of, covalent, iodides, e, g, silver, are, the, lowest, of, that, element, in, particular, silver, iodide, is, very, insoluble, in, water, and, its, formation, is, often, used, as, a, qualitative, test, for, iodine, the, halogens, form, many, binary, diamagnetic, interhalogen, compounds, with, stoichiometries, xy, xy, 3, xy, 5, and, xy, 7, where, x, is, heavier, than, y, and, iodine, is, no, exception, iodine, forms, all, three, possible, diatomic, interhalogens, a, trifluoride, and, trichloride, as, well, as, a, pentafluoride, and, exceptionally, among, the, halogens, a, heptafluoride, numerous, cationic, and, anionic, derivatives, are, also, characterised, such, as, the, wine, red, or, bright, orange, compounds, of, icl, 2, and, the, dark, brown, or, purplish, black, compounds, of, i, 2, cl, apart, from, these, some, pseudohalides, are, also, known, such, as, cyanogen, iodide, icn, iodine, thiocyanate, iscn, and, iodine, azide, in, 3, iodine, monofluoride, if, is, unstable, at, room, temperature, and, disproportionates, very, readily, and, irreversibly, to, iodine, and, iodine, pentafluoride, and, thus, cannot, be, obtained, pure, it, can, be, synthesised, from, the, reaction, of, iodine, with, fluorine, gas, in, trichlorofluoromethane, at, 45, c, with, iodine, trifluoride, in, trichlorofluoromethane, at, 78, c, or, with, silver, i, fluoride, at, 0, c, iodine, monochloride, icl, and, iodine, monobromide, ibr, on, the, other, hand, are, moderately, stable, the, former, a, volatile, red, brown, compound, was, discovered, independently, by, joseph, louis, gay, lussac, and, humphry, davy, in, 1813, 1814, not, long, after, the, discoveries, of, chlorine, and, iodine, and, it, mimics, the, intermediate, halogen, bromine, so, well, that, justus, von, liebig, was, misled, into, mistaking, bromine, which, he, had, found, for, iodine, monochloride, iodine, monochloride, and, iodine, monobromide, may, be, prepared, simply, by, reacting, iodine, with, chlorine, or, bromine, at, room, temperature, and, purified, by, fractional, crystallisation, both, are, quite, reactive, and, attack, even, platinum, and, gold, though, not, boron, carbon, cadmium, lead, zirconium, niobium, molybdenum, and, tungsten, their, reaction, with, organic, compounds, depends, on, conditions, iodine, chloride, vapour, tends, to, chlorinate, phenol, and, salicylic, acid, since, when, iodine, chloride, undergoes, homolytic, fission, chlorine, and, iodine, are, produced, and, the, former, is, more, reactive, however, iodine, chloride, in, carbon, tetrachloride, solution, results, in, iodination, being, the, main, reaction, since, now, heterolytic, fission, of, the, i, cl, bond, occurs, and, i, attacks, phenol, as, an, electrophile, however, iodine, monobromide, tends, to, brominate, phenol, even, in, carbon, tetrachloride, solution, because, it, tends, to, dissociate, into, its, elements, in, solution, and, bromine, is, more, reactive, than, iodine, when, liquid, iodine, monochloride, and, iodine, monobromide, dissociate, into, i, 2, x, and, ix, 2, ions, x, cl, br, thus, they, are, significant, conductors, of, electricity, and, can, be, used, as, ionising, solvents, iodine, trifluoride, if, 3, is, an, unstable, yellow, solid, that, decomposes, above, 28, c, it, is, thus, little, known, it, is, difficult, to, produce, because, fluorine, gas, would, tend, to, oxidise, iodine, all, the, way, to, the, pentafluoride, reaction, at, low, temperature, with, xenon, difluoride, is, necessary, iodine, trichloride, which, exists, in, the, solid, state, as, the, planar, dimer, i, 2, cl, 6, is, a, bright, yellow, solid, synthesised, by, reacting, iodine, with, liquid, chlorine, at, 80, c, caution, is, necessary, during, purification, because, it, easily, dissociates, to, iodine, monochloride, and, chlorine, and, hence, can, act, as, a, strong, chlorinating, agent, liquid, iodine, trichloride, conducts, electricity, possibly, indicating, dissociation, to, icl, 2, and, icl, 4, ions, iodine, pentafluoride, if, 5, a, colourless, volatile, liquid, is, the, most, thermodynamically, stable, iodine, fluoride, and, can, be, made, by, reacting, iodine, with, fluorine, gas, at, room, temperature, it, is, a, fluorinating, agent, but, is, mild, enough, to, store, in, glass, apparatus, again, slight, electrical, conductivity, is, present, in, the, liquid, state, because, of, dissociation, to, if, 4, and, if, 6, the, pentagonal, bipyramidal, iodine, heptafluoride, if, 7, is, an, extremely, powerful, fluorinating, agent, behind, only, chlorine, trifluoride, chlorine, pentafluoride, and, bromine, pentafluoride, among, the, interhalogens, it, reacts, with, almost, all, the, elements, even, at, low, temperatures, fluorinates, pyrex, glass, to, form, iodine, vii, oxyfluoride, iof, 5, and, sets, carbon, monoxide, on, fire, iodine, oxides, are, the, most, stable, of, all, the, halogen, oxides, because, of, the, strong, i, o, bonds, resulting, from, the, large, electronegativity, difference, between, iodine, and, oxygen, and, they, have, been, known, for, the, longest, time, the, stable, white, hygroscopic, iodine, pentoxide, i, 2, o, 5, has, been, known, since, its, formation, in, 1813, by, gay, lussac, and, davy, it, is, most, easily, made, by, the, dehydration, of, iodic, acid, hio, 3, of, which, it, is, the, anhydride, it, will, quickly, oxidise, carbon, monoxide, completely, to, carbon, dioxide, at, room, temperature, and, is, thus, a, useful, reagent, in, determining, carbon, monoxide, concentration, it, also, oxidises, nitrogen, oxide, ethylene, and, hydrogen, sulfide, it, reacts, with, sulfur, trioxide, and, peroxydisulfuryl, difluoride, s, 2, o, 6, f, 2, to, form, salts, of, the, iodyl, cation, and, is, reduced, by, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, to, iodosyl, salts, involving, it, may, be, fluorinated, by, fluorine, bromine, trifluoride, sulfur, tetrafluoride, or, chloryl, fluoride, resulting, iodine, pentafluoride, which, also, reacts, with, iodine, pentoxide, giving, iodine, v, oxyfluoride, iof, 3, a, few, other, less, stable, oxides, are, known, notably, i, 4, o, 9, and, i, 2, o, 4, their, structures, have, not, been, determined, but, reasonable, guesses, are, i, iii, i, v, o, 3, 3, and, respectively, more, important, are, the, four, oxoacids, hypoiodous, acid, hio, iodous, acid, hio, 2, iodic, acid, hio, 3, and, periodic, acid, hio, 4, or, h, 5, io, 6, when, iodine, dissolves, in, aqueous, solution, the, following, reactions, occur, hypoiodous, acid, is, unstable, to, disproportionation, the, hypoiodite, ions, thus, formed, disproportionate, immediately, to, give, iodide, and, iodate, iodous, acid, and, iodite, are, even, less, stable, and, exist, only, as, a, fleeting, intermediate, in, the, oxidation, of, iodide, to, iodate, if, at, all, iodates, are, by, far, the, most, important, of, these, compounds, which, can, be, made, by, oxidising, alkali, metal, iodides, with, oxygen, at, 600, c, and, high, pressure, or, by, oxidising, iodine, with, chlorates, unlike, chlorates, which, disproportionate, very, slowly, to, form, chloride, and, perchlorate, iodates, are, stable, to, disproportionation, in, both, acidic, and, alkaline, solutions, from, these, salts, of, most, metals, can, be, obtained, iodic, acid, is, most, easily, made, by, oxidation, of, an, aqueous, iodine, suspension, by, electrolysis, or, fuming, nitric, acid, iodate, has, the, weakest, oxidising, power, of, the, halates, but, reacts, the, quickest, many, periodates, are, known, including, not, only, the, expected, tetrahedral, io, 4, but, also, square, pyramidal, io, 3, 5, octahedral, orthoperiodate, io, 5, 6, 2, 4, and, i, 2, o, 4, 9, they, are, usually, made, by, oxidising, alkaline, sodium, iodate, electrochemically, with, lead, iv, oxide, as, the, anode, or, by, chlorine, gas, they, are, thermodymically, and, kinetically, powerful, oxidising, agents, quickly, oxidising, mn, 2, to, mno, 4, and, cleaving, glycols, diketones, ketols, aminoalcohols, and, diamines, orthoperiodate, especially, stabilises, high, oxidation, states, among, metals, because, of, its, very, high, negative, charge, of, 5, orthoperiodic, acid, h, 5, io, 6, is, stable, and, dehydrates, at, 100, c, in, a, vacuum, to, metaperiodic, acid, hio, 4, attempting, to, go, further, does, not, result, in, the, nonexistent, iodine, heptoxide, i, 2, o, 7, but, rather, iodine, pentoxide, and, oxygen, periodic, acid, may, be, protonated, by, sulfuric, acid, to, give, the, i, oh, 6, cation, isoelectronic, to, te, oh, 6, and, sb, oh, 6, and, giving, salts, with, bisulfate, and, sulfate, when, iodine, dissolves, in, strong, acids, such, as, fuming, sulfuric, acid, a, bright, blue, paramagnetic, solution, including, i, 2, cations, is, formed, a, solid, salt, of, the, diiodine, cation, may, be, obtained, by, oxidising, iodine, with, antimony, pentafluoride, the, salt, i, 2, sb, 2, f, 11, is, dark, blue, and, the, blue, tantalum, analogue, i, 2, ta, 2, f, 11, is, also, known, whereas, the, i, i, bond, length, in, i, 2, is, 267, pm, that, in, i, 2, is, only, 256, pm, as, the, missing, electron, in, the, latter, has, been, removed, from, an, antibonding, orbital, making, the, bond, stronger, and, hence, shorter, in, fluorosulfuric, acid, solution, deep, blue, i, 2, reversibly, dimerises, below, 60, c, forming, red, rectangular, diamagnetic, i, 2, 4, other, polyiodine, cations, are, not, as, well, characterised, including, bent, dark, brown, or, black, i, 3, and, centrosymmetric, c, 2, h, green, or, black, i, 5, known, in, the, asf, 6, and, alcl, 4, salts, among, others, the, only, important, polyiodide, anion, in, aqueous, solution, is, linear, triiodide, i, 3, its, formation, explains, why, the, solubility, of, iodine, in, water, may, be, increased, by, the, addition, of, potassium, iodide, solution, many, other, polyiodides, may, be, found, when, solutions, containing, iodine, and, iodide, crystallise, such, as, i, 5, i, 9, i, 2, 4, and, i, 2, 8, whose, salts, with, large, weakly, polarising, cations, such, as, cs, may, be, isolated, organoiodine, compounds, have, been, fundamental, in, the, development, of, organic, synthesis, such, as, in, the, hofmann, elimination, of, amines, the, williamson, ether, synthesis, the, wurtz, coupling, reaction, and, in, grignard, reagents, the, carbon, iodine, bond, is, a, common, functional, group, that, forms, part, of, core, organic, chemistry, formally, these, compounds, may, be, thought, of, as, organic, derivatives, of, the, iodide, anion, the, simplest, organoiodine, compounds, alkyl, iodides, may, be, synthesised, by, the, reaction, of, alcohols, with, phosphorus, triiodide, these, may, then, be, used, in, nucleophilic, substitution, reactions, or, for, preparing, grignard, reagents, the, c, i, bond, is, the, weakest, of, all, the, carbon, halogen, bonds, due, to, the, minuscule, difference, in, electronegativity, between, carbon, 2, 55, and, iodine, 2, 66, as, such, iodide, is, the, best, leaving, group, among, the, halogens, to, such, an, extent, that, many, organoiodine, compounds, turn, yellow, when, stored, over, time, due, to, decomposition, into, elemental, iodine, as, such, they, are, commonly, used, in, organic, synthesis, because, of, the, easy, formation, and, cleavage, of, the, c, i, bond, they, are, also, significantly, denser, than, the, other, organohalogen, compounds, thanks, to, the, high, atomic, weight, of, iodine, a, few, organic, oxidising, agents, like, the, iodanes, contain, iodine, in, a, higher, oxidation, state, than, 1, such, as, 2, iodoxybenzoic, acid, a, common, reagent, for, the, oxidation, of, alcohols, to, aldehydes, and, iodobenzene, dichloride, phicl, 2, used, for, the, selective, chlorination, of, alkenes, and, alkynes, one, of, the, more, well, known, uses, of, organoiodine, compounds, is, the, so, called, iodoform, test, where, iodoform, chi, 3, is, produced, by, the, exhaustive, iodination, of, a, methyl, ketone, or, another, compound, capable, of, being, oxidised, to, a, methyl, ketone, as, follows, some, drawbacks, of, using, organoiodine, compounds, as, compared, to, organochlorine, or, organobromine, compounds, is, the, greater, expense, and, toxicity, of, the, iodine, derivatives, since, iodine, is, expensive, and, organoiodine, compounds, are, stronger, alkylating, agents, for, example, iodoacetamide, and, iodoacetic, acid, denature, proteins, by, irreversibly, alkylating, cysteine, residues, and, preventing, the, reformation, of, disulfide, linkages, halogen, exchange, to, produce, iodoalkanes, by, the, finkelstein, reaction, is, slightly, complicated, by, the, fact, that, iodide, is, a, better, leaving, group, than, chloride, or, bromide, the, difference, is, nevertheless, small, enough, that, the, reaction, can, be, driven, to, completion, by, exploiting, the, differential, solubility, of, halide, salts, or, by, using, a, large, excess, of, the, halide, salt, in, the, classic, finkelstein, reaction, an, alkyl, chloride, or, an, alkyl, bromide, is, converted, to, an, alkyl, iodide, by, treatment, with, a, solution, of, sodium, iodide, in, acetone, sodium, iodide, is, soluble, in, acetone, and, sodium, chloride, and, sodium, bromide, are, not, the, reaction, is, driven, toward, products, by, mass, action, due, to, the, precipitation, of, the, insoluble, salt, iodine, is, the, least, abundant, of, the, stable, halogens, comprising, only, 0, 46, parts, per, million, of, earth, s, crustal, rocks, compare, fluorine, 544, ppm, chlorine, 126, ppm, bromine, 2, 5, ppm, making, it, the, 60th, most, abundant, element, iodide, minerals, are, rare, and, most, deposits, that, are, concentrated, enough, for, economical, extraction, are, iodate, minerals, instead, examples, include, lautarite, ca, io, 3, 2, and, dietzeite, 7ca, io, 3, 2, 8cacro, 4, these, are, the, minerals, that, occur, as, trace, impurities, in, the, caliche, found, in, chile, whose, main, product, is, sodium, nitrate, in, total, they, can, contain, at, least, 0, 02, and, at, most, 1, iodine, by, mass, sodium, iodate, is, extracted, from, the, caliche, and, reduced, to, iodide, by, sodium, bisulfite, this, solution, is, then, reacted, with, freshly, extracted, iodate, resulting, in, comproportionation, to, iodine, which, may, be, filtered, off, the, caliche, was, the, main, source, of, iodine, in, the, 19th, century, and, continues, to, be, important, today, replacing, kelp, which, is, no, longer, an, economically, viable, source, but, in, the, late, 20th, century, brines, emerged, as, a, comparable, source, the, japanese, minami, kant, gas, field, east, of, tokyo, and, the, american, anadarko, basin, gas, field, in, northwest, oklahoma, are, the, two, largest, such, sources, the, brine, is, hotter, than, 60, c, from, the, depth, of, the, source, the, brine, is, first, purified, and, acidified, using, sulfuric, acid, then, the, iodide, present, is, oxidised, to, iodine, with, chlorine, an, iodine, solution, is, produced, but, is, dilute, and, must, be, concentrated, air, is, blown, into, the, solution, to, evaporate, the, iodine, which, is, passed, into, an, absorbing, tower, where, sulfur, dioxide, reduces, the, iodine, the, hydrogen, iodide, hi, is, reacted, with, chlorine, to, precipitate, the, iodine, after, filtering, and, purification, the, iodine, is, packed, these, sources, ensure, that, chile, and, japan, are, the, largest, producers, of, iodine, today, alternatively, the, brine, may, be, treated, with, silver, nitrate, to, precipitate, out, iodine, as, silver, iodide, which, is, then, decomposed, by, reaction, with, iron, to, form, metallic, silver, and, a, solution, of, iron, ii, iodide, the, iodine, is, then, liberated, by, displacement, with, chlorine, about, half, of, all, produced, iodine, goes, into, various, organoiodine, compounds, another, 15, remains, as, the, pure, element, another, 15, is, used, to, form, potassium, iodide, and, another, 15, for, other, inorganic, iodine, compounds, among, the, major, uses, of, iodine, compounds, are, catalysts, animal, feed, supplements, stabilisers, dyes, colourants, and, pigments, pharmaceutical, sanitation, from, tincture, of, iodine, and, photography, minor, uses, include, smog, inhibition, cloud, seeding, and, various, uses, in, analytical, chemistry, the, iodide, and, iodate, anions, are, often, used, for, quantitative, volumetric, analysis, for, example, in, iodometry, iodine, and, starch, form, a, blue, complex, and, this, reaction, is, often, used, to, test, for, either, starch, or, iodine, and, as, an, indicator, in, iodometry, the, iodine, test, for, starch, is, still, used, to, detect, counterfeit, banknotes, printed, on, starch, containing, paper, the, iodine, value, is, the,

rather, poor, ion, thruster, propulsion, systems, employing, iodine, as, the, reaction, mass, can, be, built, more, compactly, with, less, mass, and, cost, and, operate, more, efficiently, than, the, gridded, ion, thrusters, that, were, utilized, to, propel, previous, spacecraft, such, as, japan, s, hayabusa, probes, esa, s, goce, satellite, or, nasa, s, dart, mission, all, of, which, used, xenon, for, this, purpose, iodine, s, atomic, weight, is, only, 3, 3, less, than, that, of, xenon, while, its, first, two, ionisation, energies, average, 12, less, together, these, make, iodine, ions, a, promising, substitute, however, iodine, introduces, chemical, reactivity, issues, not, present, in, xenon, plasmas, use, of, iodine, should, allow, more, widespread, application, of, ion, thrust, technology, particularly, with, smaller, scale, space, vehicles, according, to, the, european, space, agency, this, small, but, potentially, disruptive, innovation, could, help, to, clear, the, skies,

studies, suggest, that, japan, s, consumption, is, closer, to, 1, 000, 3, 000, g, day, the, adult, ul, in, japan, was, last, revised, to, 3, 000, g, day, in, 2015, after, iodine, fortification, programs, such, as, iodisation, of, salt, have, been, done, some, cases, of, iodine, induced, hyperthyroidism, have, been, observed, so, called, jod, basedow, phenomenon, the, condition, occurs, mainly, in, people, above, 40, years, of, age, and, the, risk, is, higher, when, iodine, deficiency, is, high, and, the, first, rise, in, iodine, consumption, is, high, in, areas, where, there, is, little, iodine, in, the, diet, which, are, remote, inland, areas, and, faraway, mountainous, areas, where, no, iodine, rich, foods, are, eaten, iodine, deficiency, gives, rise, to, hypothyroidism, symptoms, of, which, are, extreme, fatigue, goitre, mental, slowing, depression, low, weight, gain, and, low, basal, body, temperatures, iodine, deficiency, is, the, leading, cause, of, preventable, intellectual, disability, a, result, that, occurs, primarily, when, babies, or, small, children, are, rendered, hypothyroidic, by, no, iodine, the, addition, of, iodine, to, salt, has, largely, destroyed, this, problem, in, wealthier, areas, but, iodine, deficiency, remains, a, serious, public, health, problem, in, poorer, areas, today, iodine, deficiency, is, also, a, problem, in, certain, areas, of, all, continents, of, the, world, information, processing, fine, motor, skills, and, visual, problem, solving, are, normalised, by, iodine, repletion, in, iodine, deficient, people, elemental, iodine, i, 2, is, toxic, if, taken, orally, undiluted, the, lethal, dose, for, an, adult, human, is, 30, mg, kg, which, is, about, 2, 1, 2, 4, grams, for, a, human, weighing, 70, to, 80, kg, even, when, experiments, on, rats, demonstrated, that, these, animals, could, survive, after, eating, a, 14000, mg, kg, dose, and, are, still, living, after, that, excess, iodine, is, more, cytotoxic, in, the, presence, of, selenium, deficiency, iodine, supplementation, in, selenium, deficient, populations, is, problematic, for, this, reason, the, toxicity, derives, from, its, oxidizing, properties, through, which, it, denaturates, proteins, including, enzymes, elemental, iodine, is, also, a, skin, irritant, direct, contact, with, skin, can, cause, damage, and, solid, iodine, crystals, should, be, handled, with, care, solutions, with, high, elemental, iodine, concentration, such, as, tincture, of, iodine, and, lugol, s, solution, are, capable, of, causing, tissue, damage, if, used, in, prolonged, cleaning, or, antisepsis, similarly, liquid, povidone, iodine, betadine, trapped, against, the, skin, resulted, in, chemical, burns, in, some, reported, cases, people, can, be, exposed, to, iodine, in, the, workplace, by, inhalation, ingestion, skin, contact, and, eye, contact, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, has, set, the, legal, limit, permissible, exposure, limit, for, iodine, exposure, in, the, workplace, at, 0, 1, ppm, 1, mg, m, 3, during, an, 8, hour, workday, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, has, set, a, recommended, exposure, limit, rel, of, 0, 1, ppm, 1, mg, m, 3, during, an, 8, hour, workday, at, levels, of, 2, ppm, iodine, is, immediately, dangerous, to, life, and, health, some, people, develop, a, hypersensitivity, to, products, and, foods, containing, iodine, applications, of, tincture, of, iodine, or, betadine, can, cause, rashes, sometimes, severe, parenteral, use, of, iodine, based, contrast, agents, see, above, can, cause, reactions, ranging, from, a, mild, rash, to, fatal, anaphylaxis, such, reactions, have, led, to, the, misconception, widely, held, even, among, physicians, that, some, people, are, allergic, to, iodine, itself, even, allergies, to, iodine, rich, foods, have, been, so, construed, in, fact, there, has, never, been, a, confirmed, report, of, a, true, iodine, allergy, as, an, allergy, to, iodine, or, iodine, salts, is, biologically, impossible, hypersensitivity, reactions, to, products, and, foods, containing, iodine, are, apparently, related, to, their, other, molecular, components, thus, a, person, who, has, demonstrated, an, allergy, to, one, food, or, product, containing, iodine, may, not, have, an, allergic, reaction, to, another, patients, with, various, food, allergies, fishes, shellfishes, eggs, milk, seaweeds, kelp, meats, vegetables, kombu, wakame, do, not, have, an, increased, risk, for, a, contrast, medium, hypersensitivity, as, with, all, medications, the, patient, s, allergy, history, should, be, questioned, and, consulted, before, any, containing, iodine, are, administered, phosphorus, reduces, iodine, to, hydroiodic, acid, which, is, a, reagent, effective, for, reducing, ephedrine, and, pseudoephedrine, to, methamphetamine, for, this, reason, iodine, was, designated, by, the, united, states, drug, enforcement, administration, as, a, list, i, precursor, chemical, under, 21, cfr, 1310, 02
