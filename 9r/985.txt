a, centripetal, force, from, latin, centrum, center, and, petere, to, seek, is, a, force, that, makes, a, body, follow, a, curved, path, the, direction, of, the, centripetal, force, is, always, orthogonal, to, the, motion, of, the, body, and, towards, the, fixed, point, of, the, instantaneous, center, of, curvature, of, the, path, isaac, newton, described, it, as, a, force, by, which, bodies, are, drawn, or, impelled, or, in, any, way, tend, towards, a, point, as, to, a, centre, in, newtonian, mechanics, gravity, provides, the, centripetal, force, causing, astronomical, orbits, one, common, example, involving, centripetal, force, is, the, case, in, which, a, body, moves, with, uniform, speed, along, a, circular, path, the, centripetal, force, is, directed, at, right, angles, to, the, motion, and, also, along, the, radius, towards, the, centre, of, the, circular, path, the, mathematical, description, was, derived, in, 1659, by, the, dutch, physicist, christiaan, huygens, from, the, kinematics, of, curved, motion, it, is, known, that, an, object, moving, at, tangential, speed, v, along, a, path, with, radius, of, curvature, r, accelerates, toward, the, center, of, curvature, at, a, rate, a, c, lim, t, 0, v, t, a, c, v, 2, r, displaystyle, textbf, a, c, lim, delta, t, to, 0, frac, delta, textbf, v, delta, t, quad, a, c, frac, v, 2, r, here, a, c, displaystyle, a, c, is, the, centripetal, acceleration, and, v, displaystyle, delta, textbf, v, is, the, difference, between, the, velocity, vectors, at, t, t, displaystyle, t, delta, t, and, t, displaystyle, t, by, newton, s, second, law, the, cause, of, acceleration, is, a, net, force, acting, on, the, object, which, is, proportional, to, its, mass, m, and, its, acceleration, the, force, usually, referred, to, as, a, centripetal, force, has, a, magnitude, f, c, m, a, c, m, v, 2, r, displaystyle, f, c, ma, c, m, frac, v, 2, r, and, is, like, centripetal, acceleration, directed, toward, the, center, of, curvature, of, the, object, s, trajectory, the, centripetal, acceleration, can, be, inferred, from, the, diagram, of, the, velocity, vectors, at, two, instances, in, the, case, of, uniform, circular, motion, the, velocities, have, constant, magnitude, because, each, one, is, perpendicular, to, its, respective, position, vector, simple, vector, subtraction, implies, two, similar, isosceles, triangles, with, congruent, angles, one, comprising, a, base, of, v, displaystyle, delta, textbf, v, and, a, leg, length, of, v, displaystyle, v, and, the, other, a, base, of, r, displaystyle, delta, textbf, r, position, vector, difference, and, a, leg, length, of, r, displaystyle, r, v, v, r, r, displaystyle, frac, delta, textbf, v, v, frac, delta, textbf, r, r, v, v, r, r, displaystyle, delta, textbf, v, frac, v, r, delta, textbf, r, therefore, v, displaystyle, delta, textbf, v, can, be, substituted, with, v, r, r, displaystyle, frac, v, r, delta, textbf, r, a, c, lim, t, 0, v, t, v, r, lim, t, 0, r, t, lim, t, 0, r, t, v, v, 2, r, displaystyle, a, c, lim, delta, t, to, 0, frac, delta, textbf, v, delta, t, frac, v, r, lim, delta, t, to, 0, frac, delta, textbf, r, delta, t, omega, lim, delta, t, to, 0, frac, delta, textbf, r, delta, t, v, omega, frac, v, 2, r, the, direction, of, the, force, is, toward, the, center, of, the, circle, in, which, the, object, is, moving, or, the, osculating, circle, the, circle, that, best, fits, the, local, path, of, the, object, if, the, path, is, not, circular, the, speed, in, the, formula, is, squared, so, twice, the, speed, needs, four, times, the, force, at, a, given, radius, this, force, is, also, sometimes, written, in, terms, of, the, angular, velocity, of, the, object, about, the, center, of, the, circle, related, to, the, tangential, velocity, by, the, formula, v, r, displaystyle, v, omega, r, so, that, f, c, m, r, 2, displaystyle, f, c, mr, omega, 2, expressed, using, the, orbital, period, t, for, one, revolution, of, the, circle, 2, t, displaystyle, omega, frac, 2, pi, t, the, equation, becomes, f, c, m, r, 2, t, 2, displaystyle, f, c, mr, left, frac, 2, pi, t, right, 2, in, particle, accelerators, velocity, can, be, very, high, close, to, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, so, the, same, rest, mass, now, exerts, greater, inertia, relativistic, mass, thereby, requiring, greater, force, for, the, same, centripetal, acceleration, so, the, equation, becomes, f, c, m, v, 2, r, displaystyle, f, c, frac, gamma, mv, 2, r, where, 1, 1, v, 2, c, 2, displaystyle, gamma, frac, 1, sqrt, 1, frac, v, 2, c, 2, is, the, lorentz, factor, thus, the, centripetal, force, is, given, by, f, c, m, v, displaystyle, f, c, gamma, mv, omega, which, is, the, rate, of, change, of, relativistic, momentum, m, v, displaystyle, gamma, mv, in, the, case, of, an, object, that, is, swinging, around, on, the, end, of, a, rope, in, a, horizontal, plane, the, centripetal, force, on, the, object, is, supplied, by, the, tension, of, the, rope, the, rope, example, is, an, example, involving, a, pull, force, the, centripetal, force, can, also, be, supplied, as, a, push, force, such, as, in, the, case, where, the, normal, reaction, of, a, wall, supplies, the, centripetal, force, for, a, wall, of, death, or, a, rotor, rider, newton, s, idea, of, a, centripetal, force, corresponds, to, what, is, nowadays, referred, to, as, a, central, force, when, a, satellite, is, in, orbit, around, a, planet, gravity, is, considered, to, be, a, centripetal, force, even, though, in, the, case, of, eccentric, orbits, the, gravitational, force, is, directed, towards, the, focus, and, not, towards, the, instantaneous, center, of, curvature, another, example, of, centripetal, force, arises, in, the, helix, that, is, traced, out, when, a, charged, particle, moves, in, a, uniform, magnetic, field, in, the, absence, of, other, external, forces, in, this, case, the, magnetic, force, is, the, centripetal, force, that, acts, towards, the, helix, axis, below, are, three, examples, of, increasing, complexity, with, derivations, of, the, formulas, governing, velocity, and, acceleration, uniform, circular, motion, refers, to, the, case, of, constant, rate, of, rotation, here, are, two, approaches, to, describing, this, case, in, two, dimensions, the, position, vector, r, displaystyle, textbf, r, which, has, magnitude, length, r, displaystyle, r, and, directed, at, an, angle, displaystyle, theta, above, the, x, axis, can, be, expressed, in, cartesian, coordinates, using, the, unit, vectors, x, displaystyle, hat, mathbf, x, and, y, displaystyle, hat, mathbf, y, r, r, cos, x, r, sin, y, displaystyle, textbf, r, r, cos, theta, hat, mathbf, x, r, sin, theta, hat, mathbf, y, the, assumption, of, uniform, circular, motion, requires, three, things, the, velocity, v, displaystyle, textbf, v, and, acceleration, a, displaystyle, textbf, a, of, the, motion, are, the, first, and, second,

coordinates, consequently, a, 2, r, displaystyle, textbf, a, omega, 2, textbf, r, negative, shows, that, the, acceleration, is, pointed, towards, the, center, of, the, circle, opposite, the, radius, hence, it, is, called, centripetal, i, e, center, seeking, while, objects, naturally, follow, a, straight, path, due, to, inertia, this, centripetal, acceleration, describes, the, circular, motion, path, caused, by, a, centripetal, force, the, image, at, right, shows, the, vector, relationships, for, uniform, circular, motion, the, rotation, itself, is, represented, by, the, angular, velocity, vector, which, is, normal, to, the, plane, of, the, orbit, using, the, right, hand, rule, and, has, magnitude, given, by, with, the, angular, position, at, time, t, in, this, subsection, d, d, t, is, assumed, constant, independent, of, time, the, distance, traveled, d, of, the, particle, in, time, d, t, along, the, circular, path, is, which, by, properties, of, the, vector, cross, product, has, magnitude, r, d, and, is, in, the, direction, tangent, to, the, circular, path, consequently, in, other, words, differentiating, with, respect, to, time, a, d, e, f, d, v, d, t, d, r, t, d, t, r, t,

agrees, with, the, previous, section, though, the, notation, is, slightly, different, when, the, rate, of, rotation, is, made, constant, in, the, analysis, of, nonuniform, circular, motion, that, analysis, agrees, with, this, one, a, merit, of, the, vector, approach, is, that, it, is, manifestly, independent, of, any, coordinate, system, the, upper, panel, in, the, image, at, right, shows, a, ball, in, circular, motion, on, a, banked, curve, the, curve, is, banked, at, an, angle, from, the, horizontal, and, the, surface, of, the, road, is, considered, to, be, slippery, the, objective, is, to, find, what, angle, the, bank, must, have, so, the, ball, does, not, slide, off, the, road, intuition, tells, us, that, on, a, flat, curve, with, no, banking, at, all, the, ball, will, simply, slide, off, the, road, while, with, a, very, steep, banking, the, ball, will, slide, to, the, center, unless, it, travels, the, curve, rapidly, apart, from, any, acceleration, that, might, occur, in, the, direction, of, the, path, the, lower, panel, of, the, image, above, indicates, the, forces, on, the, ball, there, are, two, forces, one, is, the, force, of, gravity, vertically, downward, through, the, center, of, mass, of, the, ball, m, g, where, m, is, the, mass, of, the, ball, and, g, is, the, gravitational, acceleration, the, second, is, the, upward, normal, force, exerted, by, the, road, at, a, right, angle, to, the, road, surface, m, a, n, the, centripetal, force, demanded, by, the, curved, motion, is, also, shown, above, this, centripetal, force, is, not, a, third, force, applied, to, the, ball, but, rather, must, be, provided, by, the, net, force, on, the, ball, resulting, from, vector, addition, of, the, normal, force, and, the, force, of, gravity, the, resultant, or, net, force, on, the, ball, found, by, vector, addition, of, the, normal, force, exerted, by, the, road, and, vertical, force, due, to, gravity, must, equal, the, centripetal, force, dictated, by, the, need, to, travel, a, circular, path, the, curved, motion, is, maintained, so, long, as, this, net, force, provides, the, centripetal, force, requisite, to, the, motion, the, horizontal, net, force, on, the, ball, is, the, horizontal, component, of, the, force, from, the, road, which, has, magnitude, f, h, m, a, n, sin, the, vertical, component, of, the, force, from, the, road, must, counteract, the, gravitational, force, f, v, m, a, n, cos, m, g, which, implies, a, n, g, cos, substituting, into, the, above, formula, for, f, h, yields, a, horizontal, force, to, be, f, h, m, g, sin, cos, m, g, tan, displaystyle, mathbf, f, mathrm, h, m, mathbf, g, frac, sin, theta, cos, theta, m, mathbf, g, tan, theta, on, the, other, hand, at, velocity, v, on, a, circular, path, of, radius, r, kinematics, says, that, the, force, needed, to, turn, the, ball, continuously, into, the, turn, is, the, radially, inward, centripetal, force, f, c, of, magnitude, f, c, m, a, c, m, v, 2, r, displaystyle, mathbf, f, mathrm, c, m, mathbf, a, mathrm, c, frac, m, mathbf, v, 2, r, consequently, the, ball, is, in, a, stable, path, when, the, angle, of, the, road, is, set, to, satisfy, the, condition, m, g, tan, m, v, 2, r, displaystyle, m, mathbf, g, tan, theta, frac, m, mathbf, v, 2, r, or, tan, v, 2, g, r, displaystyle, tan, theta, frac, mathbf, v, 2, mathbf, g, r, as, the, angle, of, bank, approaches, 90, the, tangent, function, approaches, infinity, allowing, larger, values, for, v, 2, r, in, words, this, equation, states, that, for, greater, speeds, bigger, v, the, road, must, be, banked, more, steeply, a, larger, value, for, and, for, sharper, turns, smaller, r, the, road, also, must, be, banked, more, steeply, which, accords, with, intuition, when, the, angle, does, not, satisfy, the, above, condition, the, horizontal, component, of, force, exerted, by, the, road, does, not, provide, the, correct, centripetal, force, and, an, additional, frictional, force, tangential, to, the, road, surface, is, called, upon, to, provide, the, difference, if, friction, cannot, do, this, that, is, the, coefficient, of, friction, is, exceeded, the, ball, slides, to, a, different, radius, where, the, balance, can, be, realized, these, ideas, apply, to, air, flight, as, well, see, the, faa, pilot, s, manual, as, a, generalization, of, the, uniform, circular, motion, case, suppose, the, angular, rate, of, rotation, is, not, constant, the, acceleration, now, has, a, tangential, component, as, shown, the, image, at, right, this, case, is, used, to, demonstrate, a, derivation, strategy, based, on, a, polar, coordinate, system, let, r, t, be, a, vector, that, describes, the, position, of, a, point, mass, as, a, function, of, time, since, we, are, assuming, circular, motion, let, r, t, r, u, r, where, r, is, a, constant, the, radius, of, the, circle, and, u, r, is, the, unit, vector, pointing, from, the, origin, to, the, point, mass, the, direction, of, u, r, is, described, by, the, angle, between, the, x, axis, and, the, unit, vector, measured, counterclockwise, from, the, x, axis, the, other, unit, vector, for, polar, coordinates, u, is, perpendicular, to, u, r, and, points, in, the, direction, of, increasing, these, polar, unit, vectors, can, be, expressed, in, terms, of, cartesian, unit, vectors, in, the, x, and, y, directions, denoted, i, displaystyle, hat, mathbf, i, and, j, displaystyle, hat, mathbf, j, respectively, u, r, cos, i, sin, j, displaystyle, mathbf, u, r, cos, theta, hat, mathbf, i, sin, theta, hat, mathbf, j, and, u, sin, i, cos, j, displaystyle, mathbf, u, theta, sin, theta, hat, mathbf, i, cos, theta, hat, mathbf, j, one, can, differentiate, to, find, velocity, v, r, d, u, r, d, t, r, d, d, t, cos, i, sin, j, r, d, d, t, d, d, cos, i, sin, j, r, d, d, t, sin, i, cos, j, r, d, d, t, u, r, u, displaystyle, begin, aligned, mathbf, v, r, frac, d, mathbf, u, r, dt, r, frac, d, dt, left, cos, theta, hat,

velocity, matches, expectations, that, the, velocity, should, be, directed, tangentially, to, the, circle, and, that, the, magnitude, of, the, velocity, should, be, r, differentiating, again, and, noting, that, d, u, d, t, d, d, t, u, r, u, r, displaystyle, frac, d, mathbf, u, theta, dt, frac, d, theta, dt, mathbf, u, r, omega, mathbf, u, r, we, find, that, the, acceleration, a, is, a, r, d, d, t, u, 2, u, r, displaystyle, mathbf, a, r, left, frac, d, omega, dt, mathbf, u, theta, omega, 2, mathbf, u, r, right, thus, the, radial, and, tangential, components, of, the, acceleration, are, a, r, 2, r, u, r, v, 2, r, u, r, displaystyle, mathbf, a, r, omega, 2, r, mathbf, u, r, frac, mathbf, v, 2, r, mathbf, u, r, and, a, r, d, d, t, u, d, v, d, t, u, displaystyle, mathbf, a, theta, r, frac, d, omega, dt, mathbf, u, theta, frac, d, mathbf, v, dt, mathbf, u, theta, where, v, r, is, the, magnitude, of, the, velocity, the, speed, these, equations, express, mathematically, that, in, the, case, of, an, object, that, moves, along, a, circular, path, with, a, changing, speed, the, acceleration, of, the, body, may, be, decomposed, into, a, perpendicular, component, that, changes, the, direction, of, motion, the, centripetal, acceleration, and, a, parallel, or, tangential, component, that, changes, the, speed, the, above, results, can, be, derived, perhaps, more, simply, in, polar, coordinates, and, at, the, same, time, extended, to, general, motion, within, a, plane, as, shown, next, polar, coordinates, in, the, plane, employ, a, radial, unit, vector, u, and, an, angular, unit, vector, u, as, shown, above, a, particle, at, position, r, is, described, by, r, u, displaystyle, mathbf, r, rho, mathbf, u, rho, where, the, notation, is, used, to, describe, the, distance, of, the, path, from, the, origin, instead, of, r, to, emphasize, that, this, distance, is, not, fixed, but, varies, with, time, the, unit, vector, u, travels, with, the, particle, and, always, points, in, the, same, direction, as, r, t, unit, vector, u, also, travels, with, the, particle, and, stays, orthogonal, to, u, thus, u, and, u, form, a, local, cartesian, coordinate, system, attached, to, the, particle, and, tied, to, the, path, travelled, by, the, particle, by, moving, the, unit, vectors, so, their, tails, coincide, as, seen, in, the, circle, at, the, left, of, the, image, above, it, is, seen, that, u, and, u, form, a, right, angled, pair, with, tips, on, the, unit, circle, that, trace, back, and, forth, on, the, perimeter, of, this, circle, with, the, same, angle, t, as, r, t, when, the, particle, moves, its, velocity, is, to, evaluate, the, velocity, the, derivative, of, the, unit, vector, u, is, needed, because, u, is, a, unit, vector, its, magnitude, is, fixed, and, it, can, change, only, in, direction, that, is, its, change, d, u, has, a, component, only, perpendicular, to, u, when, the, trajectory, r, t, rotates, an, amount, d, u, which, points, in, the, same, direction, as, r, t, also, rotates, by, d, see, image, above, therefore, the, change, in, u, is, or, in, a, similar, fashion, the, rate, of, change, of, u, is, found, as, with, u, u, is, a, unit, vector, and, can, only, rotate, without, changing, size, to, remain, orthogonal, to, u, while, the, trajectory, r, t, rotates, an, amount, d, u, which, is, orthogonal, to, r, t, also, rotates, by, d, see, image, above, therefore, the, change, d, u, is, orthogonal, to, u, and, proportional, to, d, see, image, above, the, equation, above, shows, the, sign, to, be, negative, to, maintain, orthogonality, if, d, u, is, positive, with, d, then, d, u, must, decrease, substituting, the, derivative, of, u, into, the, expression, for, velocity, to, obtain, the, acceleration, another, time, differentiation, is, done, substituting, the, derivatives, of, u, and, u, the, acceleration, of, the, particle, is, as, a, particular, example, if, the, particle, moves, in, a, circle, of, constant, radius, r, then, d, d, t, 0, v, v, and, a, u, d, d, t, 2, u, d, 2, d, t, 2, u, v, 2, r, u, d, v, d, t, displaystyle, mathbf, a, mathbf, u, rho, left, mathbf, u, theta, left, mathbf, u, rho, left, mathbf, u, theta, left, where, v, v, displaystyle, v, v, theta, these, results, agree, with, those, above, for, nonuniform, circular, motion, see, also, the, article, on, non, uniform, circular, motion, if, this, acceleration, is, multiplied, by, the, particle, mass, the, leading, term, is, the, centripetal, force, and, the, negative, of, the, second, term, related, to, angular, acceleration, is, sometimes, called, the, euler, force, for, trajectories, other, than, circular, motion, for, example, the, more, general, trajectory, envisioned, in, the, image, above, the, instantaneous, center, of, rotation, and, radius, of, curvature, of, the, trajectory, are, related, only, indirectly, to, the, coordinate, system, defined, by, u, and, u, and, to, the, length, r, t, consequently, in, the, general, case, it, is, not, straightforward, to, disentangle, the, centripetal, and, euler, terms, from, the, above, general, acceleration, equation, to, deal, directly, with, this, issue, local, coordinates, are, preferable, as, discussed, next, local, coordinates, mean, a, set, of, coordinates, that, travel, with, the, particle, and, have, orientation, determined, by, the, path, of, the, particle, unit, vectors, are, formed, as, shown, in, the, image, at, right, both, tangential, and, normal, to, the, path, this, coordinate, system, sometimes, is, referred, to, as, intrinsic, or, path, coordinates, or, nt, coordinates, for, normal, tangential, referring, to, these, unit, vectors, these, coordinates, are, a, very, special, example, of, a, more, general, concept, of, local, coordinates, from, the, theory, of, differential, forms, distance, along, the, path, of, the, particle, is, the, arc, length, s, considered, to, be, a, known, function, of, time, a, center, of, curvature, is, defined, at, each, position, s, located, a, distance, the, radius, of, curvature, from, the, curve, on, a, line, along, the, normal, u, n, s, the, required, distance, s, at, arc, length, s, is, defined, in, terms, of, the, rate, of, rotation, of, the, tangent, to, the, curve, which, in, turn, is, determined, by, the, path, itself, if, the, orientation, of, the, tangent, relative, to, some, starting, position, is, s, then, s, is, defined, by, the, derivative, d, d, s, the, radius, of, curvature, usually, is, taken, as, positive, that, is, as, an, absolute, value, while, the, curvature, is, a, signed, quantity, a, geometric, approach, to, finding, the, center, of, curvature, and, the, radius, of, curvature, uses, a, limiting, process, leading, to, the, osculating, circle, see, image, above, using, these, coordinates, the, motion, along, the, path, is, viewed, as, a, succession, of, circular, paths, of, ever, changing, center, and, at, each, position, s, constitutes, non, uniform, circular, motion, at, that, position, with, radius, the, local, value, of, the, angular, rate, of, rotation, then, is, given, by, with, the, local, speed, v, given, by, as, for, the, other, examples, above, because, unit, vectors, cannot, change, magnitude, their, rate, of, change, is, always, perpendicular, to, their, direction, see, the, left, hand, insert, in, the, image, above, consequently, the, velocity, and, acceleration, are, and, using, the, chain, rule, of, differentiation, in, this, local, coordinate, system, the, acceleration, resembles, the, expression, for, nonuniform, circular, motion, with, the, local, radius, s, and, the, centripetal, acceleration, is, identified, as, the, second, term, extending, this, approach, to, three, dimensional, space, curves, leads, to, the, frenet, serret, formulas, looking, at, the, image, above, one, might, wonder, whether, adequate, account, has, been, taken, of, the, difference, in, curvature, between, s, and, s, d, s, in, computing, the, arc, length, as, d, s, s, d, reassurance, on, this, point, can, be, found, using, a, more, formal, approach, outlined, below, this, approach, also, makes, connection, with, the, article, on, curvature, to, introduce, the, unit, vectors, of, the, local, coordinate, system, one, approach, is, to, begin, in, cartesian, coordinates, and, describe, the, local, coordinates, in, terms, of, these, cartesian, coordinates, in, terms, of, arc, length, s, let, the, path, be, described, as, r, s, x, s, y, s, displaystyle, mathbf, r, s, left, then, an, incremental, displacement, along, the, path, d, s, is, described, by, d, r, s, d, x, s, d, y, s, x, s, y, s, d, s, displaystyle, mathrm, d, mathbf, r, s, left, left, mathrm, d, s, where, primes, are, introduced, to, denote, derivatives, with, respect, to, s, the, magnitude, of, this, displacement, is, d, s, showing, that, this, displacement, is, necessarily, a, tangent, to, the,

curve, is, u, n, s, y, s, x, s, displaystyle, mathbf, u, mathrm, n, s, left, orthogonality, can, be, verified, by, showing, that, the, vector, dot, product, is, zero, the, unit, magnitude, of, these, vectors, is, a, consequence, of, eq, 1, using, the, tangent, vector, the, angle, of, the, tangent, to, the, curve, is, given, by, sin, y, s, x, s, 2, y, s, 2, y, s, displaystyle, sin, theta, frac, y,

formally, without, need, for, geometric, interpretation, as, 1, d, d, s, displaystyle, frac, 1, rho, frac, mathrm, d, theta, mathrm, d, s, the, derivative, of, can, be, found, from, that, for, sin, d,

is, the, same, as, that, for, circular, motion, based, on, the, radius, using, this, coordinate, system, in, the, inertial, frame, it, is, easy, to, identify, the, force, normal, to, the, trajectory, as, the, centripetal, force, and, that, parallel, to, the, trajectory, as, the, tangential, force, from, a, qualitative, standpoint, the, path, can, be, approximated, by, an, arc, of, a, circle, for, a, limited, time, and, for, the, limited, time, a, particular, radius, of, curvature, applies, the, centrifugal, and, euler, forces, can, be, analyzed, on, the, basis, of, circular, motion, with, that, radius, this, result, for, acceleration, agrees, with, that, found, earlier, however, in, this, approach, the, question, of, the, change, in, radius, of, curvature, with, s, is, handled, completely, formally, consistent, with, a, geometric, interpretation, but, not, relying, upon, it, thereby, avoiding, any, questions, the, image, above, might, suggest, about, neglecting, the, variation, in, to, illustrate, the, above, formulas, let, x, y, be, given, as, then, which, can, be, recognized, as, a, circular, path, around, the, origin, with, radius, the, position, s, 0, corresponds, to, or, 3, o, clock, to, use, the, above, formalism, the, derivatives, are, needed, with, these, results, one, can, verify, that, the, unit, vectors, can, also, be, found, which, serve, to, show, that, s, 0, is, located, at, position, and, s, 2, at, which, agrees, with, the, original, expressions, for, x, and, y, in, other, words, s, is, measured, counterclockwise, around, the, circle, from, 3, o, clock, also, the, derivatives, of, these, vectors, can, be, found, to, obtain, velocity, and, acceleration, a, time, dependence, for, s, is, necessary, for, counterclockwise, motion, at, variable, speed, v, t, where, v, t, is, the, speed, and, t, is, time, and, s, t, 0, 0, then, where, it, already, is, established, that, this, acceleration, is, the, standard, result, for, non, uniform, circular, motion
