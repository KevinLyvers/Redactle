a, cave, or, cavern, is, a, natural, void, under, the, earth, s, surface, caves, often, form, by, the, weathering, of, rock, and, often, extend, deep, underground, exogene, caves, are, smaller, openings, that, extend, a, relatively, short, distance, underground, such, as, rock, shelters, caves, which, extend, further, underground, than, the, opening, is, wide, are, called, endogene, caves, speleology, is, the, science, of, exploration, and, study, of, all, aspects, of, caves, and, the, cave, environment, visiting, or, exploring, caves, for, recreation, may, be, called, caving, potholing, or, spelunking, the, formation, and, development, of, caves, is, known, as, speleogenesis, it, can, occur, over, the, course, of, millions, of, years, caves, can, range, widely, in, size, and, are, formed, by, various, geological, processes, these, may, involve, a, combination, of, chemical, processes, erosion, by, water, tectonic, forces, microorganisms, pressure, and, atmospheric, influences, isotopic, dating, techniques, can, be, applied, to, cave, sediments, to, determine, the, timescale, of, the, geological, events, which, formed, and, shaped, present, day, caves, it, is, estimated, that, a, cave, cannot, be, more, than, 3, 000, metres, 9, 800, ft, vertically, beneath, the, surface, due, to, the, pressure, of, overlying, rocks, this, does, not, however, impose, a, maximum, depth, for, a, cave, which, is, measured, from, its, highest, entrance, to, its, lowest, point, as, the, amount, of, rock, above, the, lowest, point, is, dependent, on, the, topography, of, the, landscape, above, it, for, karst, caves, the, maximum, depth, is, determined, on, the, basis, of, the, lower, limit, of, karst, forming, processes, coinciding, with, the, base, of, the, soluble, carbonate, rocks, most, caves, are, formed, in, limestone, by, dissolution, caves, can, be, classified, in, various, other, ways, as, well, including, a, contrast, between, active, and, relict, active, caves, have, water, flowing, through, them, relict, caves, do, not, though, water, may, be, retained, in, them, types, of, active, caves, include, inflow, caves, into, which, a, stream, sinks, outflow, caves, from, which, a, stream, emerges, and, through, caves, traversed, by, a, stream, solutional, caves, or, karst, caves, are, the, most, frequently, occurring, caves, such, caves, form, in, rock, that, is, soluble, most, occur, in, limestone, but, they, can, also, form, in, other, rocks, including, chalk, dolomite, marble, salt, and, gypsum, except, for, salt, caves, solutional, caves, result, when, rock, is, dissolved, by, natural, acid, in, groundwater, that, seeps, through, bedding, planes, faults, joints, and, comparable, features, over, time, cracks, enlarge, to, become, caves, and, cave, systems, the, largest, and, most, abundant, solutional, caves, are, located, in, limestone, limestone, dissolves, under, the, action, of, rainwater, and, groundwater, charged, with, h, 2, co, 3, carbonic, acid, and, naturally, occurring, organic, acids, the, dissolution, process, produces, a, distinctive, landform, known, as, karst, characterized, by, sinkholes, and, underground, drainage, limestone, caves, are, often, adorned, with, calcium, carbonate, formations, produced, through, slow, precipitation, these, include, flowstones, stalactites, stalagmites, helictites, soda, straws, and, columns, these, secondary, mineral, deposits, in, caves, are, called, speleothems, the, portions, of, a, solutional, cave, that, are, below, the, water, table, or, the, local, level, of, the, groundwater, will, be, flooded, lechuguilla, cave, in, new, mexico, and, nearby, carlsbad, cavern, are, now, believed, to, be, examples, of, another, type, of, solutional, cave, they, were, formed, by, h, 2, s, hydrogen, sulfide, gas, rising, from, below, where, reservoirs, of, oil, give, off, sulfurous, fumes, this, gas, mixes, with, groundwater, and, forms, h, 2, so, 4, sulfuric, acid, the, acid, then, dissolves, the, limestone, from, below, rather, than, from, above, by, acidic, water, percolating, from, the, surface, caves, formed, at, the, same, time, as, the, surrounding, rock, are, called, primary, caves, lava, tubes, are, formed, through, volcanic, activity, and, are, the, most, common, primary, caves, as, lava, flows, downhill, its, surface, cools, and, solidifies, hot, liquid, lava, continues, to, flow, under, that, crust, and, if, most, of, it, flows, out, a, hollow, tube, remains, such, caves, can, be, found, in, the, canary, islands, jeju, do, the, basaltic, plains, of, eastern, idaho, and, in, other, places, kazumura, cave, near, hilo, hawaii, is, a, remarkably, long, and, deep, lava, tube, it, is, 65, 6, km, long, 40, 8, mi, lava, caves, include, but, are, not, limited, to, lava, tubes, other, caves, formed, through, volcanic, activity, include, rifts, lava, molds, open, vertical, conduits, inflationary, blisters, among, others, sea, caves, are, found, along, coasts, around, the, world, a, special, case, is, littoral, caves, which, are, formed, by, wave, action, in, zones, of, weakness, in, sea, cliffs, often, these, weaknesses, are, faults, but, they, may, also, be, dykes, or, bedding, plane, contacts, some, wave, cut, caves, are, now, above, sea, level, because, of, later, uplift, elsewhere, in, places, such, as, thailand, s, phang, nga, bay, solutional, caves, have, been, flooded, by, the, sea, and, are, now, subject, to, littoral, erosion, sea, caves, are, generally, around, 5, to, 50, metres, 16, to, 164, ft, in, length, but, may, exceed, 300, metres, 980, ft, corrasional, or, erosional, caves, are, those, that, form, entirely, by, erosion, by, flowing, streams, carrying, rocks, and, other, sediments, these, can, form, in, any, type, of, rock, including, hard, rocks, such, as, granite, generally, there, must, be, some, zone, of, weakness, to, guide, the, water, such, as, a, fault, or, joint, a, subtype, of, the, erosional, cave, is, the, wind, or, aeolian, cave, carved, by, wind, born, sediments, many, caves, formed, initially, by, solutional, processes, often, undergo, a, subsequent, phase, of, erosional, or, vadose, enlargement, where, active, streams, or, rivers, pass, through, them, glacier, caves, are, formed, by, melting, ice, and, flowing, water, within, and, under, glaciers, the, cavities, are, influenced, by, the, very, slow, flow, of, the, ice, which, tends, to, collapse, the, caves, again, glacier, caves, are, sometimes, misidentified, as, ice, caves, though, this, latter, term, is, properly, reserved, for, bedrock, caves, that, contain, year, round, ice, formations, fracture, caves, are, formed, when, layers, of, more, soluble, minerals, such, as, gypsum, dissolve, out, from, between, layers, of, less, soluble, rock, these, rocks, fracture, and, collapse, in, blocks, of, stone, talus, caves, are, formed, by, the, openings, among, large, boulders, that, have, fallen, down, into, a, random, heap, often, at, the, bases, of, cliffs, these, unstable, deposits, are, called, talus, or, scree, and, may, be, subject, to, frequent, rockfalls, and, landslides, anchialine, caves, are, caves, usually, coastal, containing, a, mixture, of, freshwater, and, saline, water, usually, sea, water, they, occur, in, many, parts, of, the, world, and, often, contain, highly, specialized, and, endemic, fauna, caves, are, found, throughout, the, world, although, the, distribution, of, documented, cave, system, is, heavily, skewed, towards, those, countries, where, caving, has, been, popular, for, many, years, such, as, france, italy, australia, the, uk, the, united, states, etc, as, a, result, explored, caves, are, found, widely, in, europe, asia, north, america, and, oceania, but, are, sparse, in, south, america, africa, and, antarctica, this, is, a, rough, generalization, as, large, expanses, of, north, america, and, asia, contain, no, documented, caves, whereas, areas, such, as, the, madagascar, dry, deciduous, forests, and, parts, of, brazil, contain, many, documented, caves, as, the, world, s, expanses, of, soluble, bedrock, are, researched, by, cavers, the, distribution, of, documented, caves, is, likely, to, shift, for, example, china, despite, containing, around, half, the, world, s, exposed, limestone, more, than, 1, 000, 000, square, kilometres, 390, 000, sq, mi, has, relatively, few, documented, caves, cave, inhabiting, animals, are, often, categorized, as, troglobites, cave, limited, species, troglophiles, species, that, can, live, their, entire, lives, in, caves, but, also, occur, in, other, environments, trogloxenes, species, that, use, caves, but, cannot, complete, their, life, cycle, fully, in, caves, and, accidentals, animals, not, in, one, of, the, previous, categories, some, authors, use, separate, terminology, for, aquatic, forms, for, example, stygobites, stygophiles, and, stygoxenes, of, these, animals, the, troglobites, are, perhaps, the, most, unusual, organisms, troglobitic, species, often, show, a, number, of, characteristics, termed, troglomorphic, associated, with, their, adaptation, to, subterranean, life, these, characteristics, may, include, a, loss, of, pigment, often, resulting, in, a, pale, or, white, coloration, a, loss, of, eyes, or, at, least, of, optical, functionality, an, elongation, of, appendages, and, an, enhancement, of, other, senses, such, as, the, ability, to, sense, vibrations, in, water, aquatic, troglobites, or, stygobites, such, as, the, endangered, alabama, cave, shrimp, live, in, bodies, of, water, found, in, caves, and, get, nutrients, from, detritus, washed, into, their, caves, and, from, the, feces, of, bats, and, other, cave, inhabitants, other, aquatic, troglobites, include, cave, fish, and, cave, salamanders, such, as, the, olm, and, the, texas, blind, salamander, cave, insects, such, as, oligaphorura, formerly, archaphorura, schoetti, are, troglophiles, reaching, 1, 7, millimetres, 0, 067, in, in, length, they, have, extensive, distribution, and, have, been, studied, fairly, widely, most, specimens, are, female, but, a, male, specimen, was, collected, from, st, cuthberts, swallet, in, 1969, bats, such, as, the, gray, bat, and, mexican, free, tailed, bat, are, trogloxenes, and, are, often, found, in, caves, they, forage, outside, of, the, caves, some, species, of, cave, crickets, are, classified, as, trogloxenes, because, they, roost, in, caves, by, day, and, forage, above, ground, at, night, because, of, the, fragility, of, cave, ecosystems, and, the, fact, that, cave, regions, tend, to, be, isolated, from, one, another, caves, harbor, a, number, of, endangered, species, such, as, the, tooth, cave, spider, liphistius, trapdoor, spider, and, the, gray, bat, caves, are, visited, by, many, surface, living, animals, including, humans, these, are, usually, relatively, short, lived, incursions, due, to, the, lack, of, light, and, sustenance, cave, entrances, often, have, typical, florae, for, instance, in, the, eastern, temperate, united, states, cave, entrances, are, most, frequently, and, often, densely, populated, by, the, bulblet, fern, cystopteris, bulbifera, people, have, made, use, of, caves, throughout, history, the, earliest, human, fossils, found, in, caves, come, from, a, series, of, caves, near, krugersdorp, and, mokopane, in, south, africa, the, cave, sites, of, sterkfontein, swartkrans, kromdraai, b, drimolen, malapa, cooper, s, d, gladysvale, gondolin, and, makapansgat, have, yielded, a, range, of, early, human, species, dating, back, to, between, three, and, one, million, years, ago, including, australopithecus, africanus, australopithecus, sediba, and, paranthropus, robustus, however, it, is, not, generally, thought, that, these, early, humans, were, living, in, the, caves, but, that, they, were, brought, into, the, caves, by, carnivores, that, had, killed, them, the, first, early, hominid, ever, found, in, africa, the, taung, child, in, 1924, was, also, thought, for, many, years, to, come, from, a, cave, where, it, had, been, deposited, after, being, predated, on, by, an, eagle, however, this, is, now, debated, hopley, et, al, 2013, am, j, phys, anthrop, caves, do, form, in, the, dolomite, of, the, ghaap, plateau, including, the, early, middle, and, later, stone, age, site, of, wonderwerk, cave, however, the, caves, that, form, along, the, escarpment, s, edge, like, that, hypothesised, for, the, taung, child, are, formed, within, a, secondary, limestone, deposit, called, tufa, there, is, numerous, evidence, for, other, early, human, species, inhabiting, caves, from, at, least, one, million, years, ago, in, different, parts, of, the, world, including, homo, erectus, in, china, at, zhoukoudian, homo, rhodesiensis, in, south, africa, at, the, cave, of, hearths, makapansgat, homo, neanderthalensis, and, homo, heidelbergensis, in, europe, at, archaeological, site, of, atapuerca, homo, floresiensis, in, indonesia, and, the, denisovans, in, southern, siberia, in, southern, africa, early, modern, humans, regularly, used, sea, caves, as, shelter, starting, about, 180, 000, years, ago, when, they, learned, to, exploit, the, sea, for, the, first, time, the, oldest, known, site, is, pp13b, at, pinnacle, point, this, may, have, allowed, rapid, expansion, of, humans, out, of, africa, and, colonization, of, areas, of, the, world, such, as, australia, by, 60, 50, 000, years, ago, throughout, southern, africa, australia, and, europe, early, modern, humans, used, caves, and, rock, shelters, as, sites, for, rock, art, such, as, those, at, giant, s, castle, caves, such, as, the, yaodong, in, china, were, used, for, shelter, other, caves, were, used, for, burials, such, as, rock, cut, tombs, or, as, religious, sites, such, as, buddhist, caves, among, the, known, sacred, caves, are, china, s, cave, of, a, thousand, buddhas, and, the, sacred, caves, of, crete, paleolithic, cave, paintings, have, been, found, throughout, the, world, dating, from, 64, 800, years, old, for, non, figurative, art, and, 43, 900, years, old, for, figurative, art, the, importance, of, sound, in, caves, predates, a, modern, understanding, of, acoustics, archaeologists, have, uncovered, relationships, between, paintings, of, dots, and, lines, in, specific, areas, of, resonance, within, the, caves, of, spain, and, france, as, well, as, instruments, depicting, paleolithic, motifs, indicators, of, musical, events, and, rituals, clusters, of, paintings, were, often, found, in, areas, with, notable, acoustics, sometimes, even, replicating, the, sounds, of, the, animals, depicted, on, the, walls, the, human, voice, was, also, theorized, to, be, used, as, an, echolocation, device, to, navigate, darker, areas, of, the, caves, where, torches, were, less, useful, dots, of, red, ochre, are, often, found, in, spaces, with, the, highest, resonance, where, the, production, of, paintings, was, too, difficult, caves, continue, to, provide, usage, for, modern, day, explorers, of, acoustics, today, cumberland, caverns, provides, one, of, the, best, examples, for, modern, musical, usages, of, caves, not, only, are, the, caves, utilized, for, reverberation, but, for, the, dampening, qualities, of, their, abnormal, faces, as, well, the, irregularities, in, the, walls, of, the, cumberland, caverns, diffuse, sounds, bouncing, off, the, walls, and, give, the, space, an, almost, recording, studio, like, quality, during, the, 20th, century, musicians, began, to, explore, the, possibility, of, using, caves, as, locations, as, clubs, and, concert, halls, including, the, likes, of, dinah, shore, roy, acuff, and, benny, goodman, unlike, today, these, early, performances, were, typically, held, in, the, mouths, of, the, caves, as, the, lack, of, technology, made, depths, of, the, interior, inaccessible, with, musical, equipment, in, luray, caverns, virginia, a, functioning, organ, has, been, developed, that, generates, sound, by, mallets, striking, stalactites, each, with, a, different, pitch
