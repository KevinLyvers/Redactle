the, precambrian, p, r, i, k, m, b, r, i, n, k, e, m, pree, kam, bree, n, kaym, or, pre, cambrian, sometimes, abbreviated, pc, or, cryptozoic, is, the, earliest, part, of, earth, s, history, set, before, the, current, phanerozoic, eon, the, precambrian, is, so, named, because, it, preceded, the, cambrian, the, first, period, of, the, phanerozoic, eon, which, is, named, after, cambria, the, latinized, name, for, wales, where, rocks, from, this, age, were, first, studied, the, precambrian, accounts, for, 88, of, the, earth, s, geologic, time, the, precambrian, is, an, informal, unit, of, geologic, time, subdivided, into, three, eons, hadean, archean, proterozoic, of, the, geologic, time, scale, it, spans, from, the, formation, of, earth, about, 4, 6, billion, years, ago, ga, to, the, beginning, of, the, cambrian, period, about, 538, 8, million, years, ago, ma, when, hard, shelled, creatures, first, appeared, in, abundance, relatively, little, is, known, about, the, precambrian, despite, it, making, up, roughly, seven, eighths, of, the, earth, s, history, and, what, is, known, has, largely, been, discovered, from, the, 1960s, onwards, the, precambrian, fossil, record, is, poorer, than, that, of, the, succeeding, phanerozoic, and, fossils, from, the, precambrian, e, g, stromatolites, are, of, limited, biostratigraphic, use, this, is, because, many, precambrian, rocks, have, been, heavily, metamorphosed, obscuring, their, origins, while, others, have, been, destroyed, by, erosion, or, remain, deeply, buried, beneath, phanerozoic, strata, it, is, thought, that, the, earth, coalesced, from, material, in, orbit, around, the, sun, at, roughly, 4, 543, ma, and, may, have, been, struck, by, another, planet, called, theia, shortly, after, it, formed, splitting, off, material, that, formed, the, moon, see, giant, impact, hypothesis, a, stable, crust, was, apparently, in, place, by, 4, 433, ma, since, zircon, crystals, from, western, australia, have, been, dated, at, 4, 404, 8, ma, the, term, precambrian, is, used, by, geologists, and, paleontologists, for, general, discussions, not, requiring, a, more, specific, eon, name, however, both, the, united, states, geological, survey, and, the, international, commission, on, stratigraphy, regard, the, term, as, informal, because, the, span, of, time, falling, under, the, precambrian, consists, of, three, eons, the, hadean, the, archean, and, the, proterozoic, it, is, sometimes, described, as, a, supereon, but, this, is, also, an, informal, term, not, defined, by, the, ics, in, its, chronostratigraphic, guide, eozoic, from, eo, earliest, was, a, synonym, for, pre, cambrian, or, more, specifically, archean, a, specific, date, for, the, origin, of, life, has, not, been, determined, carbon, found, in, 3, 8, billion, year, old, rocks, archean, eon, from, islands, off, western, greenland, may, be, of, organic, origin, well, preserved, microscopic, fossils, of, bacteria, older, than, 3, 46, billion, years, have, been, found, in, western, australia, probable, fossils, 100, million, years, older, have, been, found, in, the, same, area, however, there, is, evidence, that, life, could, have, evolved, over, 4, 280, billion, years, ago, there, is, a, fairly, solid, record, of, bacterial, life, throughout, the, remainder, proterozoic, eon, of, the, precambrian, complex, multicellular, organisms, may, have, appeared, as, early, as, 2100, ma, however, the, interpretation, of, ancient, fossils, is, problematic, and, some, definitions, of, multicellularity, encompass, everything, from, simple, bacterial, colonies, to, badgers, other, possible, early, complex, multicellular, organisms, include, a, possible, 2450, ma, red, alga, from, the, kola, peninsula, 1650, ma, carbonaceous, biosignatures, in, north, china, the, 1600, ma, rafatazmia, and, a, possible, 1047, ma, bangiomorpha, red, alga, from, the, canadian, arctic, the, earliest, fossils, widely, accepted, as, complex, multicellular, organisms, date, from, the, ediacaran, period, a, very, diverse, collection, of, soft, bodied, forms, is, found, in, a, variety, of, locations, worldwide, and, date, to, between, 635, and, 542, ma, these, are, referred, to, as, ediacaran, or, vendian, biota, hard, shelled, creatures, appeared, toward, the, end, of, that, time, span, marking, the, beginning, of, the, phanerozoic, eon, by, the, middle, of, the, following, cambrian, period, a, very, diverse, fauna, is, recorded, in, the, burgess, shale, including, some, which, may, represent, stem, groups, of, modern, taxa, the, increase, in, diversity, of, lifeforms, during, the, early, cambrian, is, called, the, cambrian, explosion, of, life, while, land, seems, to, have, been, devoid, of, plants, and, animals, cyanobacteria, and, other, microbes, formed, prokaryotic, mats, that, covered, terrestrial, areas, tracks, from, an, animal, with, leg, like, appendages, have, been, found, in, what, was, mud, 551, million, years, ago, the, rna, world, hypothesis, asserts, that, rna, evolved, before, coded, proteins, and, dna, genomes, during, the, hadean, eon, 4, 567, 4, 031, ma, abundant, geothermal, microenvironments, were, present, that, may, have, had, the, potential, to, support, the, synthesis, and, replication, of, rna, and, thus, possibly, the, evolution, of, a, primitive, life, form, it, was, shown, that, porous, rock, systems, comprising, heated, air, water, interfaces, could, allow, ribozyme, catalyzed, rna, replication, of, sense, and, antisense, strands, that, could, be, followed, by, strand, dissociation, thus, enabling, combined, synthesis, release, and, folding, of, active, ribozymes, this, primitive, rna, replicative, system, also, may, have, been, able, to, undergo, template, strand, switching, during, replication, genetic, recombination, as, is, known, to, occur, during, the, rna, replication, of, extant, coronaviruses, evidence, of, the, details, of, plate, motions, and, other, tectonic, activity, in, the, precambrian, is, difficult, to, interpret, it, is, generally, believed, that, small, proto, continents, existed, before, 4280, ma, and, that, most, of, the, earth, s, landmasses, collected, into, a, single, supercontinent, around, 1130, ma, the, supercontinent, known, as, rodinia, broke, up, around, 750, ma, a, number, of, glacial, periods, have, been, identified, going, as, far, back, as, the, huronian, epoch, roughly, 2400, 2100, ma, one, of, the, best, studied, is, the, sturtian, varangian, glaciation, around, 850, 635, ma, which, may, have, brought, glacial, conditions, all, the, way, to, the, equator, resulting, in, a, snowball, earth, the, atmosphere, of, the, early, earth, is, not, well, understood, most, geologists, believe, it, was, composed, primarily, of, nitrogen, carbon, dioxide, and, other, relatively, inert, gases, and, was, lacking, in, free, oxygen, there, is, however, evidence, that, an, oxygen, rich, atmosphere, existed, since, the, early, archean, at, present, it, is, still, believed, that, molecular, oxygen, was, not, a, significant, fraction, of, earth, s, atmosphere, until, after, photosynthetic, life, forms, evolved, and, began, to, produce, it, in, large, quantities, as, a, byproduct, of, their, metabolism, this, radical, shift, from, a, chemically, inert, to, an, oxidizing, atmosphere, caused, an, ecological, crisis, sometimes, called, the, oxygen, catastrophe, at, first, oxygen, would, have, quickly, combined, with, other, elements, in, earth, s, crust, primarily, iron, removing, it, from, the, atmosphere, after, the, supply, of, oxidizable, surfaces, ran, out, oxygen, would, have, begun, to, accumulate, in, the, atmosphere, and, the, modern, high, oxygen, atmosphere, would, have, developed, evidence, for, this, lies, in, older, rocks, that, contain, massive, banded, iron, formations, that, were, laid, down, as, iron, oxides, a, terminology, has, evolved, covering, the, early, years, of, the, earth, s, existence, as, radiometric, dating, has, allowed, absolute, dates, to, be, assigned, to, specific, formations, and, features, the, precambrian, is, divided, into, three, eons, the, hadean, 4567, 3, 4031, ma, archean, 4031, 2500, ma, and, proterozoic, 2500, 538, 8, ma, see, timetable, of, the, precambrian, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, precambrian, should, be, divided, into, eons, and, eras, that, reflect, stages, of, planetary, evolution, rather, than, the, current, scheme, based, upon, numerical, ages, such, a, system, could, rely, on, events, in, the, stratigraphic, record, and, be, demarcated, by, gssps, the, precambrian, could, be, divided, into, five, natural, eons, characterized, as, follows, the, movement, of, earth, s, plates, has, caused, the, formation, and, break, up, of, continents, over, time, including, occasional, formation, of, a, supercontinent, containing, most, or, all, of, the, landmass, the, earliest, known, supercontinent, was, vaalbara, it, formed, from, proto, continents, and, was, a, supercontinent, 3, 636, billion, years, ago, vaalbara, broke, up, c, 2, 845, 2, 803, ga, ago, the, supercontinent, kenorland, was, formed, c, 2, 72, ga, ago, and, then, broke, sometime, after, 2, 45, 2, 1, ga, into, the, proto, continent, cratons, called, laurentia, baltica, yilgarn, craton, and, kalahari, the, supercontinent, columbia, or, nuna, formed, 2, 1, 1, 8, billion, years, ago, and, broke, up, about, 1, 3, 1, 2, billion, years, ago, the, supercontinent, rodinia, is, thought, to, have, formed, about, 1300, 900, ma, to, have, included, most, or, all, of, earth, s, continents, and, to, have, broken, up, into, eight, continents, around, 750, 600, million, years, ago
