light, visible, light, or, visible, radiation, is, electromagnetic, radiation, that, can, be, perceived, by, the, human, eye, visible, light, spans, the, visible, spectrum, and, is, usually, defined, as, having, wavelengths, in, the, range, of, 400, 700, nanometres, nm, corresponding, to, frequencies, of, 750, 420, terahertz, the, visible, band, sits, adjacent, to, the, infrared, with, longer, wavelengths, and, lower, frequencies, and, the, ultraviolet, with, shorter, wavelengths, and, higher, frequencies, called, collectively, optical, radiation, in, physics, the, term, light, may, refer, more, broadly, to, electromagnetic, radiation, of, any, wavelength, whether, visible, or, not, in, this, sense, gamma, rays, x, rays, microwaves, and, radio, waves, are, also, light, the, primary, properties, of, light, are, intensity, propagation, direction, frequency, or, wavelength, spectrum, and, polarization, its, speed, in, vacuum, 299, 792, 458, m, s, is, one, of, the, fundamental, constants, of, nature, like, all, types, of, electromagnetic, radiation, visible, light, propagates, by, massless, elementary, particles, called, photons, that, represents, the, quanta, of, electromagnetic, field, and, can, be, analyzed, as, both, waves, and, particles, the, study, of, light, known, as, optics, is, an, important, research, area, in, modern, physics, the, main, source, of, natural, light, on, earth, is, the, sun, historically, another, important, source, of, light, for, humans, has, been, fire, from, ancient, campfires, to, modern, kerosene, lamps, with, the, development, of, electric, lights, and, power, systems, electric, lighting, has, effectively, replaced, firelight, generally, electromagnetic, radiation, emr, is, classified, by, wavelength, into, radio, waves, microwaves, infrared, the, visible, spectrum, that, we, perceive, as, light, ultraviolet, x, rays, and, gamma, rays, the, designation, radiation, excludes, static, electric, magnetic, and, near, fields, the, behavior, of, emr, depends, on, its, wavelength, higher, frequencies, have, shorter, wavelengths, and, lower, frequencies, have, longer, wavelengths, when, emr, interacts, with, single, atoms, and, molecules, its, behavior, depends, on, the, amount, of, energy, per, quantum, it, carries, emr, in, the, visible, light, region, consists, of, quanta, called, photons, that, are, at, the, lower, end, of, the, energies, that, are, capable, of, causing, electronic, excitation, within, molecules, which, leads, to, changes, in, the, bonding, or, chemistry, of, the, molecule, at, the, lower, end, of, the, visible, light, spectrum, emr, becomes, invisible, to, humans, infrared, because, its, photons, no, longer, have, enough, individual, energy, to, cause, a, lasting, molecular, change, a, change, in, conformation, in, the, visual, molecule, retinal, in, the, human, retina, which, change, triggers, the, sensation, of, vision, there, exist, animals, that, are, sensitive, to, various, types, of, infrared, but, not, by, means, of, quantum, absorption, infrared, sensing, in, snakes, depends, on, a, kind, of, natural, thermal, imaging, in, which, tiny, packets, of, cellular, water, are, raised, in, temperature, by, the, infrared, radiation, emr, in, this, range, causes, molecular, vibration, and, heating, effects, which, is, how, these, animals, detect, it, above, the, range, of, visible, light, ultraviolet, light, becomes, invisible, to, humans, mostly, because, it, is, absorbed, by, the, cornea, below, 360, nm, and, the, internal, lens, below, 400, nm, furthermore, the, rods, and, cones, located, in, the, retina, of, the, human, eye, cannot, detect, the, very, short, below, 360, nm, ultraviolet, wavelengths, and, are, in, fact, damaged, by, ultraviolet, many, animals, with, eyes, that, do, not, require, lenses, such, as, insects, and, shrimp, are, able, to, detect, ultraviolet, by, quantum, photon, absorption, mechanisms, in, much, the, same, chemical, way, that, humans, detect, visible, light, various, sources, define, visible, light, as, narrowly, as, 420, 680, nm, to, as, broadly, as, 380, 800, nm, under, ideal, laboratory, conditions, people, can, see, infrared, up, to, at, least, 1, 050, nm, children, and, young, adults, may, perceive, ultraviolet, wavelengths, down, to, about, 310, 313, nm, plant, growth, is, also, affected, by, the, colour, spectrum, of, light, a, process, known, as, photomorphogenesis, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, is, defined, to, be, exactly, 299, 792, 458, m, s, approx, 186, 282, miles, per, second, the, fixed, value, of, the, speed, of, light, in, si, units, results, from, the, fact, that, the, metre, is, now, defined, in, terms, of, the, speed, of, light, all, forms, of, electromagnetic, radiation, move, at, exactly, this, same, speed, in, vacuum, different, physicists, have, attempted, to, measure, the, speed, of, light, throughout, history, galileo, attempted, to, measure, the, speed, of, light, in, the, seventeenth, century, an, early, experiment, to, measure, the, speed, of, light, was, conducted, by, ole, r, mer, a, danish, physicist, in, 1676, using, a, telescope, r, mer, observed, the, motions, of, jupiter, and, one, of, its, moons, io, noting, discrepancies, in, the, apparent, period, of, io, s, orbit, he, calculated, that, light, takes, about, 22, minutes, to, traverse, the, diameter, of, earth, s, orbit, however, its, size, was, not, known, at, that, time, if, r, mer, had, known, the, diameter, of, the, earth, s, orbit, he, would, have, calculated, a, speed, of, 227, 000, 000, m, s, another, more, accurate, measurement, of, the, speed, of, light, was, performed, in, europe, by, hippolyte, fizeau, in, 1849, fizeau, directed, a, beam, of, light, at, a, mirror, several, kilometers, away, a, rotating, cog, wheel, was, placed, in, the, path, of, the, light, beam, as, it, traveled, from, the, source, to, the, mirror, and, then, returned, to, its, origin, fizeau, found, that, at, a, certain, rate, of, rotation, the, beam, would, pass, through, one, gap, in, the, wheel, on, the, way, out, and, the, next, gap, on, the, way, back, knowing, the, distance, to, the, mirror, the, number, of, teeth, on, the, wheel, and, the, rate, of, rotation, fizeau, was, able, to, calculate, the, speed, of, light, as, 313, 000, 000, m, s, l, on, foucault, carried, out, an, experiment, which, used, rotating, mirrors, to, obtain, a, value, of, 298, 000, 000, m, s, in, 1862, albert, a, michelson, conducted, experiments, on, the, speed, of, light, from, 1877, until, his, death, in, 1931, he, refined, foucault, s, methods, in, 1926, using, improved, rotating, mirrors, to, measure, the, time, it, took, light, to, make, a, round, trip, from, mount, wilson, to, mount, san, antonio, in, california, the, precise, measurements, yielded, a, speed, of, 299, 796, 000, m, s, the, effective, velocity, of, light, in, various, transparent, substances, containing, ordinary, matter, is, less, than, in, vacuum, for, example, the, speed, of, light, in, water, is, about, 3, 4, of, that, in, vacuum, two, independent, teams, of, physicists, were, said, to, bring, light, to, a, complete, standstill, by, passing, it, through, a, bose, einstein, condensate, of, the, element, rubidium, one, team, at, harvard, university, and, the, rowland, institute, for, science, in, cambridge, massachusetts, and, the, other, at, the, harvard, smithsonian, center, for, astrophysics, also, in, cambridge, however, the, popular, description, of, light, being, stopped, in, these, experiments, refers, only, to, light, being, stored, in, the, excited, states, of, atoms, then, re, emitted, at, an, arbitrary, later, time, as, stimulated, by, a, second, laser, pulse, during, the, time, it, had, stopped, it, had, ceased, to, be, light, the, study, of, light, and, the, interaction, of, light, and, matter, is, termed, optics, the, observation, and, study, of, optical, phenomena, such, as, rainbows, and, the, aurora, borealis, offer, many, clues, as, to, the, nature, of, light, a, transparent, object, allows, light, to, transmit, or, pass, through, conversely, an, opaque, object, does, not, allow, light, to, transmit, through, and, instead, reflecting, or, absorbing, the, light, it, receives, most, objects, do, not, reflect, or, transmit, light, specularly, and, to, some, degree, scatters, the, incoming, light, which, is, called, glossiness, surface, scatterance, is, caused, by, the, surface, roughness, of, the, reflecting, surfaces, and, internal, scatterance, is, caused, by, the, difference, of, refractive, index, between, the, particles, and, medium, inside, the, object, like, transparent, objects, translucent, objects, allow, light, to, transmit, through, but, translucent, objects, also, scatter, certain, wavelength, of, light, via, internal, scatterance, refraction, is, the, bending, of, light, rays, when, passing, through, a, surface, between, one, transparent, material, and, another, it, is, described, by, snell, s, law, where, 1, is, the, angle, between, the, ray, and, the, surface, normal, in, the, first, medium, 2, is, the, angle, between, the, ray, and, the, surface, normal, in, the, second, medium, and, n, 1, and, n, 2, are, the, indices, of, refraction, n, 1, in, a, vacuum, and, n, 1, in, a, transparent, substance, when, a, beam, of, light, crosses, the, boundary, between, a, vacuum, and, another, medium, or, between, two, different, media, the, wavelength, of, the, light, changes, but, the, frequency, remains, constant, if, the, beam, of, light, is, not, orthogonal, or, rather, normal, to, the, boundary, the, change, in, wavelength, results, in, a, change, in, the, direction, of, the, beam, this, change, of, direction, is, known, as, refraction, the, refractive, quality, of, lenses, is, frequently, used, to, manipulate, light, in, order, to, change, the, apparent, size, of, images, magnifying, glasses, spectacles, contact, lenses, microscopes, and, refracting, telescopes, are, all, examples, of, this, manipulation, there, are, many, sources, of, light, a, body, at, a, given, temperature, emits, a, characteristic, spectrum, of, black, body, radiation, a, simple, thermal, source, is, sunlight, the, radiation, emitted, by, the, chromosphere, of, the, sun, at, around, 6, 000, k, 5, 730, c, 10, 340, f, solar, radiation, peaks, in, the, visible, region, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, when, plotted, in, wavelength, units, and, roughly, 44, of, the, radiation, that, reaches, the, ground, is, visible, another, example, is, incandescent, light, bulbs, which, emit, only, around, 10, of, their, energy, as, visible, light, and, the, remainder, as, infrared, a, common, thermal, light, source, in, history, is, the, glowing, solid, particles, in, flames, but, these, also, emit, most, of, their, radiation, in, the, infrared, and, only, a, fraction, in, the, visible, spectrum, the, peak, of, the, black, body, spectrum, is, in, the, deep, infrared, at, about, 10, micrometre, wavelength, for, relatively, cool, objects, like, human, beings, as, the, temperature, increases, the, peak, shifts, to, shorter, wavelengths, producing, first, a, red, glow, then, a, white, one, and, finally, a, blue, white, colour, as, the, peak, moves, out, of, the, visible, part, of, the, spectrum, and, into, the, ultraviolet, these, colours, can, be, seen, when, metal, is, heated, to, red, hot, or, white, hot, blue, white, thermal, emission, is, not, often, seen, except, in, stars, the, commonly, seen, pure, blue, colour, in, a, gas, flame, or, a, welder, s, torch, is, in, fact, due, to, molecular, emission, notably, by, ch, radicals, emitting, a, wavelength, band, around, 425, nm, and, is, not, seen, in, stars, or, pure, thermal, radiation, atoms, emit, and, absorb, light, at, characteristic, energies, this, produces, emission, lines, in, the, spectrum, of, each, atom, emission, can, be, spontaneous, as, in, light, emitting, diodes, gas, discharge, lamps, such, as, neon, lamps, and, neon, signs, mercury, vapor, lamps, etc, and, flames, light, from, the, hot, gas, itself, so, for, example, sodium, in, a, gas, flame, emits, characteristic, yellow, light, emission, can, also, be, stimulated, as, in, a, laser, or, a, microwave, maser, deceleration, of, a, free, charged, particle, such, as, an, electron, can, produce, visible, radiation, cyclotron, radiation, synchrotron, radiation, and, bremsstrahlung, radiation, are, all, examples, of, this, particles, moving, through, a, medium, faster, than, the, speed, of, light, in, that, medium, can, produce, visible, cherenkov, radiation, certain, chemicals, produce, visible, radiation, by, chemoluminescence, in, living, things, this, process, is, called, bioluminescence, for, example, fireflies, produce, light, by, this, means, and, boats, moving, through, water, can, disturb, plankton, which, produce, a, glowing, wake, certain, substances, produce, light, when, they, are, illuminated, by, more, energetic, radiation, a, process, known, as, fluorescence, some, substances, emit, light, slowly, after, excitation, by, more, energetic, radiation, this, is, known, as, phosphorescence, phosphorescent, materials, can, also, be, excited, by, bombarding, them, with, subatomic, particles, cathodoluminescence, is, one, example, this, mechanism, is, used, in, cathode, ray, tube, television, sets, and, computer, monitors, certain, other, mechanisms, can, produce, light, when, the, concept, of, light, is, intended, to, include, very, high, energy, photons, gamma, rays, additional, generation, mechanisms, include, light, is, measured, with, two, main, alternative, sets, of, units, radiometry, consists, of, measurements, of, light, power, at, all, wavelengths, while, photometry, measures, light, with, wavelength, weighted, with, respect, to, a, standardized, model, of, human, brightness, perception, photometry, is, useful, for, example, to, quantify, illumination, lighting, intended, for, human, use, the, photometry, units, are, different, from, most, systems, of, physical, units, in, that, they, take, into, account, how, the, human, eye, responds, to, light, the, cone, cells, in, the, human, eye, are, of, three, types, which, respond, differently, across, the, visible, spectrum, and, the, cumulative, response, peaks, at, a, wavelength, of, around, 555, nm, therefore, two, sources, of, light, which, produce, the, same, intensity, w, m, 2, of, visible, light, do, not, necessarily, appear, equally, bright, the, photometry, units, are, designed, to, take, this, into, account, and, therefore, are, a, better, representation, of, how, bright, a, light, appears, to, be, than, raw, intensity, they, relate, to, raw, power, by, a, quantity, called, luminous, efficacy, and, are, used, for, purposes, like, determining, how, to, best, achieve, sufficient, illumination, for, various, tasks, in, indoor, and, outdoor, settings, the, illumination, measured, by, a, photocell, sensor, does, not, necessarily, correspond, to, what, is, perceived, by, the, human, eye, and, without, filters, which, may, be, costly, photocells, and, charge, coupled, devices, ccd, tend, to, respond, to, some, infrared, ultraviolet, or, both, light, exerts, physical, pressure, on, objects, in, its, path, a, phenomenon, which, can, be, deduced, by, maxwell, s, equations, but, can, be, more, easily, explained, by, the, particle, nature, of, light, photons, strike, and, transfer, their, momentum, light, pressure, is, equal, to, the, power, of, the, light, beam, divided, by, c, the, speed, of, light, due, to, the, magnitude, of, c, the, effect, of, light, pressure, is, negligible, for, everyday, objects, for, example, a, one, milliwatt, laser, pointer, exerts, a, force, of, about, 3, 3, piconewtons, on, the, object, being, illuminated, thus, one, could, lift, a, u, s, penny, with, laser, pointers, but, doing, so, would, require, about, 30, billion, 1, mw, laser, pointers, however, in, nanometre, scale, applications, such, as, nanoelectromechanical, systems, nems, the, effect, of, light, pressure, is, more, significant, and, exploiting, light, pressure, to, drive, nems, mechanisms, and, to, flip, nanometre, scale, physical, switches, in, integrated, circuits, is, an, active, area, of, research, at, larger, scales, light, pressure, can, cause, asteroids, to, spin, faster, acting, on, their, irregular, shapes, as, on, the, vanes, of, a, windmill, the, possibility, of, making, solar, sails, that, would, accelerate, spaceships, in, space, is, also, under, investigation, although, the, motion, of, the, crookes, radiometer, was, originally, attributed, to, light, pressure, this, interpretation, is, incorrect, the, characteristic, crookes, rotation, is, the, result, of, a, partial, vacuum, this, should, not, be, confused, with, the, nichols, radiometer, in, which, the, slight, motion, caused, by, torque, though, not, enough, for, full, rotation, against, friction, is, directly, caused, by, light, pressure, as, a, consequence, of, light, pressure, einstein, in, 1909, predicted, the, existence, of, radiation, friction, which, would, oppose, the, movement, of, matter, he, wrote, radiation, will, exert, pressure, on, both, sides, of, the, plate, the, forces, of, pressure, exerted, on, the, two, sides, are, equal, if, the, plate, is, at, rest, however, if, it, is, in, motion, more, radiation, will, be, reflected, on, the, surface, that, is, ahead, during, the, motion, front, surface, than, on, the, back, surface, the, backwardacting, force, of, pressure, exerted, on, the, front, surface, is, thus, larger, than, the, force, of, pressure, acting, on, the, back, hence, as, the, resultant, of, the, two, forces, there, remains, a, force, that, counteracts, the, motion, of, the, plate, and, that, increases, with, the, velocity, of, the, plate, we, will, call, this, resultant, radiation, friction, in, brief, usually, light, momentum, is, aligned, with, its, direction, of, motion, however, for, example, in, evanescent, waves, momentum, is, transverse, to, direction, of, propagation, in, the, fifth, century, bc, empedocles, postulated, that, everything, was, composed, of, four, elements, fire, air, earth, and, water, he, believed, that, goddess, aphrodite, made, the, human, eye, out, of, the, four, elements, and, that, she, lit, the, fire, in, the, eye, which, shone, out, from, the, eye, making, sight, possible, if, this, were, true, then, one, could, see, during, the, night, just, as, well, as, during, the, day, so, empedocles, postulated, an, interaction, between, rays, from, the, eyes, and, rays, from, a, source, such, as, the, sun, in, about, 300, bc, euclid, wrote, optica, in, which, he, studied, the, properties, of, light, euclid, postulated, that, light, travelled, in, straight, lines, and, he, described, the, laws, of, reflection, and, studied, them, mathematically, he, questioned, that, sight, is, the, result, of, a, beam, from, the, eye, for, he, asks, how, one, sees, the, stars, immediately, if, one, closes, one, s, eyes, then, opens, them, at, night, if, the, beam, from, the, eye, travels, infinitely, fast, this, is, not, a, problem, in, 55, bc, lucretius, a, roman, who, carried, on, the, ideas, of, earlier, greek, atomists, wrote, that, the, light, heat, of, the, sun, these, are, composed, of, minute, atoms, which, when, they, are, shoved, off, lose, no, time, in, shooting, right, across, the, interspace, of, air, in, the, direction, imparted, by, the, shove, from, on, the, nature, of, the, universe, despite, being, similar, to, later, particle, theories, lucretius, s, views, were, not, generally, accepted, ptolemy, c, second, century, wrote, about, the, refraction, of, light, in, his, book, optics, in, ancient, india, the, hindu, schools, of, samkhya, and, vaisheshika, from, around, the, early, centuries, ad, developed, theories, on, light, according, to, the, samkhya, school, light, is, one, of, the, five, fundamental, subtle, elements, tanmatra, out, of, which, emerge, the, gross, elements, the, atomicity, of, these, elements, is, not, specifically, mentioned, and, it, appears, that, they, were, actually, taken, to, be, continuous, the, vishnu, purana, refers, to, sunlight, as, the, seven, rays, of, the, sun, the, indian, buddhists, such, as, dign, ga, in, the, fifth, century, and, dharmakirti, in, the, seventh, century, developed, a, type, of, atomism, that, is, a, philosophy, about, reality, being, composed, of, atomic, entities, that, are, momentary, flashes, of, light, or, energy, they, viewed, light, as, being, an, atomic, entity, equivalent, to, energy, ren, descartes, 1596, 1650, held, that, light, was, a, mechanical, property, of, the, luminous, body, rejecting, the, forms, of, ibn, al, haytham, and, witelo, as, well, as, the, species, of, roger, bacon, robert, grosseteste, and, johannes, kepler, in, 1637, he, published, a, theory, of, the, refraction, of, light, that, assumed, incorrectly, that, light, travelled, faster, in, a, denser, medium, than, in, a, less, dense, medium, descartes, arrived, at, this, conclusion, by, analogy, with, the, behaviour, of, sound, waves, although, descartes, was, incorrect, about, the, relative, speeds, he, was, correct, in, assuming, that, light, behaved, like, a, wave, and, in, concluding, that, refraction, could, be, explained, by, the, speed, of, light, in, different, media, descartes, is, not, the, first, to, use, the, mechanical, analogies, but, because, he, clearly, asserts, that, light, is, only, a, mechanical, property, of, the, luminous, body, and, the, transmitting, medium, descartes, s, theory, of, light, is, regarded, as, the, start, of, modern, physical, optics, pierre, gassendi, 1592, 1655, an, atomist, proposed, a, particle, theory, of, light, which, was, published, posthumously, in, the, 1660s, isaac, newton, studied, gassendi, s, work, at, an, early, age, and, preferred, his, view, to, descartes, s, theory, of, the, plenum, he, stated, in, his, hypothesis, of, light, of, 1675, that, light, was, composed, of, corpuscles, particles, of, matter, which, were, emitted, in, all, directions, from, a, source, one, of, newton, s, arguments, against, the, wave, nature, of, light, was, that, waves, were, known, to, bend, around, obstacles, while, light, travelled, only, in, straight, lines, he, did, however, explain, the, phenomenon, of, the, diffraction, of, light, which, had, been, observed, by, francesco, grimaldi, by, allowing, that, a, light, particle, could, create, a, localised, wave, in, the, aether, newton, s, theory, could, be, used, to, predict, the, reflection, of, light, but, could, only, explain, refraction, by, incorrectly, assuming, that, light, accelerated, upon, entering, a, denser, medium, because, the, gravitational, pull, was, greater, newton, published, the, final, version, of, his, theory, in, his, opticks, of, 1704, his, reputation, helped, the, particle, theory, of, light, to, hold, sway, during, the, eighteenth, century, the, particle, theory, of, light, led, pierre, simon, laplace, to, argue, that, a, body, could, be, so, massive, that, light, could, not, escape, from, it, in, other, words, it, would, become, what, is, now, called, a, black, hole, laplace, withdrew, his, suggestion, later, after, a, wave, theory, of, light, became, firmly, established, as, the, model, for, light, as, has, been, explained, neither, a, particle, or, wave, theory, is, fully, correct, a, translation, of, newton, s, essay, on, light, appears, in, the, large, scale, structure, of, space, time, by, stephen, hawking, and, george, f, r, ellis, the, fact, that, light, could, be, polarized, was, for, the, first, time, qualitatively, explained, by, newton, using, the, particle, theory, tienne, louis, malus, in, 1810, created, a, mathematical, particle, theory, of, polarization, jean, baptiste, biot, in, 1812, showed, that, this, theory, explained, all, known, phenomena, of, light, polarization, at, that, time, the, polarization, was, considered, as, the, proof, of, the, particle, theory, to, explain, the, origin, of, colours, robert, hooke, 1635, 1703, developed, a, pulse, theory, and, compared, the, spreading, of, light, to, that, of, waves, in, water, in, his, 1665, work, micrographia, observation, ix, in, 1672, hooke, suggested, that, light, s, vibrations, could, be, perpendicular, to, the, direction, of, propagation, christiaan, huygens, 1629, 1695, worked, out, a, mathematical, wave, theory, of, light, in, 1678, and, published, it, in, his, treatise, on, light, in, 1690, he, proposed, that, light, was, emitted, in, all, directions, as, a, series, of, waves, in, a, medium, called, the, luminiferous, aether, as, waves, are, not, affected, by, gravity, it, was, assumed, that, they, slowed, down, upon, entering, a, denser, medium, the, wave, theory, predicted, that, light, waves, could, interfere, with, each, other, like, sound, waves, as, noted, around, 1800, by, thomas, young, young, showed, by, means, of, a, diffraction, experiment, that, light, behaved, as, waves, he, also, proposed, that, different, colours, were, caused, by, different, wavelengths, of, light, and, explained, colour, vision, in, terms, of, three, coloured, receptors, in, the, eye, another, supporter, of, the, wave, theory, was, leonhard, euler, he, argued, in, nova, theoria, lucis, et, colorum, 1746, that, diffraction, could, more, easily, be, explained, by, a, wave, theory, in, 1816, andr, marie, amp, re, gave, augustin, jean, fresnel, an, idea, that, the, polarization, of, light, can, be, explained, by, the, wave, theory, if, light, were, a, transverse, wave, later, fresnel, independently, worked, out, his, own, wave, theory, of, light, and, presented, it, to, the, acad, mie, des, sciences, in, 1817, sim, on, denis, poisson, added, to, fresnel, s, mathematical, work, to, produce, a, convincing, argument, in, favor, of, the, wave, theory, helping, to, overturn, newton, s, corpuscular, theory, by, the, year, 1821, fresnel, was, able, to, show, via, mathematical, methods, that, polarization, could, be, explained, by, the, wave, theory, of, light, if, and, only, if, light, was, entirely, transverse, with, no, longitudinal, vibration, whatsoever, the, weakness, of, the, wave, theory, was, that, light, waves, like, sound, waves, would, need, a, medium, for, transmission, the, existence, of, the, hypothetical, substance, luminiferous, aether, proposed, by, huygens, in, 1678, was, cast, into, strong, doubt, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, by, the, michelson, morley, experiment, newton, s, corpuscular, theory, implied, that, light, would, travel, faster, in, a, denser, medium, while, the, wave, theory, of, huygens, and, others, implied, the, opposite, at, that, time, the, speed, of, light, could, not, be, measured, accurately, enough, to, decide, which, theory, was, correct, the, first, to, make, a, sufficiently, accurate, measurement, was, l, on, foucault, in, 1850, his, result, supported, the, wave, theory, and, the, classical, particle, theory, was, finally, abandoned, only, to, partly, re, emerge, in, the, twentieth, century, in, 1845, michael, faraday, discovered, that, the, plane, of, polarization, of, linearly, polarized, light, is, rotated, when, the, light, rays, travel, along, the, magnetic, field, direction, in, the, presence, of, a, transparent, dielectric, an, effect, now, known, as, faraday, rotation, this, was, the, first, evidence, that, light, was, related, to, electromagnetism, in, 1846, he, speculated, that, light, might, be, some, form, of, disturbance, propagating, along, magnetic, field, lines, faraday, proposed, in, 1847, that, light, was, a, high, frequency, electromagnetic, vibration, which, could, propagate, even, in, the, absence, of, a, medium, such, as, the, ether, faraday, s, work, inspired, james, clerk, maxwell, to, study, electromagnetic, radiation, and, light, maxwell, discovered, that, self, propagating, electromagnetic, waves, would, travel, through, space, at, a, constant, speed, which, happened, to, be, equal, to, the, previously, measured, speed, of, light, from, this, maxwell, concluded, that, light, was, a, form, of, electromagnetic, radiation, he, first, stated, this, result, in, 1862, in, on, physical, lines, of, force, in, 1873, he, published, a, treatise, on, electricity, and, magnetism, which, contained, a, full, mathematical, description, of, the, behavior, of, electric, and, magnetic, fields, still, known, as, maxwell, s, equations, soon, after, heinrich, hertz, confirmed, maxwell, s, theory, experimentally, by, generating, and, detecting, radio, waves, in, the, laboratory, and, demonstrating, that, these, waves, behaved, exactly, like, visible, light, exhibiting, properties, such, as, reflection, refraction, diffraction, and, interference, maxwell, s, theory, and, hertz, s, experiments, led, directly, to, the, development, of, modern, radio, radar, television, electromagnetic, imaging, and, wireless, communications, in, the, quantum, theory, photons, are, seen, as, wave, packets, of, the, waves, described, in, the, classical, theory, of, maxwell, the, quantum, theory, was, needed, to, explain, effects, even, with, visual, light, that, maxwell, s, classical, theory, could, not, such, as, spectral, lines, in, 1900, max, planck, attempting, to, explain, black, body, radiation, suggested, that, although, light, was, a, wave, these, waves, could, gain, or, lose, energy, only, in, finite, amounts, related, to, their, frequency, planck, called, these, lumps, of, light, energy, quanta, from, a, latin, word, for, how, much, in, 1905, albert, einstein, used, the, idea, of, light, quanta, to, explain, the, photoelectric, effect, and, suggested, that, these, light, quanta, had, a, real, existence, in, 1923, arthur, holly, compton, showed, that, the, wavelength, shift, seen, when, low, intensity, x, rays, scattered, from, electrons, so, called, compton, scattering, could, be, explained, by, a, particle, theory, of, x, rays, but, not, a, wave, theory, in, 1926, gilbert, n, lewis, named, these, light, quanta, particles, photons, eventually, quantum, mechanics, came, to, picture, light, as, in, some, sense, both, a, particle, and, a, wave, and, in, another, sense, as, a, phenomenon, which, is, neither, a, particle, nor, a, wave, which, actually, are, macroscopic, phenomena, such, as, baseballs, or, ocean, waves, instead, under, some, approximations, light, can, be, described, sometimes, with, mathematics, appropriate, to, one, type, of, macroscopic, metaphor, particles, and, sometimes, another, macroscopic, metaphor, waves, as, in, the, case, for, radio, waves, and, the, x, rays, involved, in, compton, scattering, physicists, have, noted, that, electromagnetic, radiation, tends, to, behave, more, like, a, classical, wave, at, lower, frequencies, but, more, like, a, classical, particle, at, higher, frequencies, but, never, completely, loses, all, qualities, of, one, or, the, other, visible, light, which, occupies, a, middle, ground, in, frequency, can, easily, be, shown, in, experiments, to, be, describable, using, either, a, wave, or, particle, model, or, sometimes, both, in, 1924, 1925, satyendra, nath, bose, showed, that, light, followed, different, statistics, from, that, of, classical, particles, with, einstein, they, generalized, this, result, for, a, whole, set, of, integer, spin, particles, called, bosons, after, bose, that, follow, bose, einstein, statistics, the, photon, is, a, massless, boson, of, spin, 1, in, 1927, paul, dirac, quantized, the, electromagnetic, field, pascual, jordan, and, vladimir, fock, generalized, this, process, to, treat, many, body, systems, as, excitations, of, quantum, fields, a, process, with, the, misnomer, of, second, quantization, and, at, the, end, of, the, 1940s, a, full, theory, of, quantum, electrodynamics, was, developed, using, quantum, fields, based, on, the, works, of, julian, schwinger, richard, feynman, freeman, dyson, and, shinichiro, tomonaga, john, r, klauder, george, sudarshan, roy, j, glauber, and, leonard, mandel, applied, quantum, theory, to, the, electromagnetic, field, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, to, gain, a, more, detailed, understanding, of, photodetection, and, the, statistics, of, light, see, degree, of, coherence, this, led, to, the, introduction, of, the, coherent, state, as, a, concept, which, addressed, variations, between, laser, light, thermal, light, exotic, squeezed, states, etc, as, it, became, understood, that, light, cannot, be, fully, described, just, referring, to, the, electromagnetic, fields, describing, the, waves, in, the, classical, picture, in, 1977, h, jeff, kimble, et, al, demonstrated, a, single, atom, emitting, one, photon, at, a, time, further, compelling, evidence, that, light, consists, of, photons, previously, unknown, quantum, states, of, light, with, characteristics, unlike, classical, states, such, as, squeezed, light, were, subsequently, discovered, development, of, short, and, ultrashort, laser, pulses, created, by, q, switching, and, modelocking, techniques, opened, the, way, to, the, study, of, what, became, known, as, ultrafast, processes, applications, for, solid, state, research, e, g, raman, spectroscopy, were, found, and, mechanical, forces, of, light, on, matter, were, studied, the, latter, led, to, levitating, and, positioning, clouds, of, atoms, or, even, small, biological, samples, in, an, optical, trap, or, optical, tweezers, by, laser, beam, this, along, with, doppler, cooling, and, sisyphus, cooling, was, the, crucial, technology, needed, to, achieve, the, celebrated, bose, einstein, condensation, other, remarkable, results, are, the, demonstration, of, quantum, entanglement, quantum, teleportation, and, quantum, logic, gates, the, latter, are, of, much, interest, in, quantum, information, theory, a, subject, which, partly, emerged, from, quantum, optics, partly, from, theoretical, computer, science, sunlight, provides, the, energy, that, green, plants, use, to, create, sugars, mostly, in, the, form, of, starches, which, release, energy, into, the, living, things, that, digest, them, this, process, of, photosynthesis, provides, virtually, all, the, energy, used, by, living, things, some, species, of, animals, generate, their, own, light, a, process, called, bioluminescence, for, example, fireflies, use, light, to, locate, mates, and, vampire, squid, use, it, to, hide, themselves, from, prey
