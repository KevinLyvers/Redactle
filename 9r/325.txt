absorption, spectroscopy, is, spectroscopy, that, involves, techniques, that, measure, the, absorption, of, electromagnetic, radiation, as, a, function, of, frequency, or, wavelength, due, to, its, interaction, with, a, sample, the, sample, absorbs, energy, i, e, photons, from, the, radiating, field, the, intensity, of, the, absorption, varies, as, a, function, of, frequency, and, this, variation, is, the, absorption, spectrum, absorption, spectroscopy, is, performed, across, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, absorption, spectroscopy, is, employed, as, an, analytical, chemistry, tool, to, determine, the, presence, of, a, particular, substance, in, a, sample, and, in, many, cases, to, quantify, the, amount, of, the, substance, present, infrared, and, ultraviolet, visible, spectroscopy, are, particularly, common, in, analytical, applications, absorption, spectroscopy, is, also, employed, in, studies, of, molecular, and, atomic, physics, astronomical, spectroscopy, and, remote, sensing, there, is, a, wide, range, of, experimental, approaches, for, measuring, absorption, spectra, the, most, common, arrangement, is, to, direct, a, generated, beam, of, radiation, at, a, sample, and, detect, the, intensity, of, the, radiation, that, passes, through, it, the, transmitted, energy, can, be, used, to, calculate, the, absorption, the, source, sample, arrangement, and, detection, technique, vary, significantly, depending, on, the, frequency, range, and, the, purpose, of, the, experiment, following, are, the, major, types, of, absorption, spectroscopy, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, spectroscopy, a, material, s, absorption, spectrum, is, the, fraction, of, incident, radiation, absorbed, by, the, material, over, a, range, of, frequencies, of, electromagnetic, radiation, the, absorption, spectrum, is, primarily, determined, by, the, atomic, and, molecular, composition, of, the, material, radiation, is, more, likely, to, be, absorbed, at, frequencies, that, match, the, energy, difference, between, two, quantum, mechanical, states, of, the, molecules, the, absorption, that, occurs, due, to, a, transition, between, two, states, is, referred, to, as, an, absorption, line, and, a, spectrum, is, typically, composed, of, many, lines, the, frequencies, at, which, absorption, lines, occur, as, well, as, their, relative, intensities, primarily, depend, on, the, electronic, and, molecular, structure, of, the, sample, the, frequencies, will, also, depend, on, the, interactions, between, molecules, in, the, sample, the, crystal, structure, in, solids, and, on, several, environmental, factors, e, g, temperature, pressure, electric, field, magnetic, field, the, lines, will, also, have, a, width, and, shape, that, are, primarily, determined, by, the, spectral, density, or, the, density, of, states, of, the, system, absorption, lines, are, typically, classified, by, the, nature, of, the, quantum, mechanical, change, induced, in, the, molecule, or, atom, rotational, lines, for, instance, occur, when, the, rotational, state, of, a, molecule, is, changed, rotational, lines, are, typically, found, in, the, microwave, spectral, region, vibrational, lines, correspond, to, changes, in, the, vibrational, state, of, the, molecule, and, are, typically, found, in, the, infrared, region, electronic, lines, correspond, to, a, change, in, the, electronic, state, of, an, atom, or, molecule, and, are, typically, found, in, the, visible, and, ultraviolet, region, x, ray, absorptions, are, associated, with, the, excitation, of, inner, shell, electrons, in, atoms, these, changes, can, also, be, combined, e, g, rotation, vibration, transitions, leading, to, new, absorption, lines, at, the, combined, energy, of, the, two, changes, the, energy, associated, with, the, quantum, mechanical, change, primarily, determines, the, frequency, of, the, absorption, line, but, the, frequency, can, be, shifted, by, several, types, of, interactions, electric, and, magnetic, fields, can, cause, a, shift, interactions, with, neighboring, molecules, can, cause, shifts, for, instance, absorption, lines, of, the, gas, phase, molecule, can, shift, significantly, when, that, molecule, is, in, a, liquid, or, solid, phase, and, interacting, more, strongly, with, neighboring, molecules, the, width, and, shape, of, absorption, lines, are, determined, by, the, instrument, used, for, the, observation, the, material, absorbing, the, radiation, and, the, physical, environment, of, that, material, it, is, common, for, lines, to, have, the, shape, of, a, gaussian, or, lorentzian, distribution, it, is, also, common, for, a, line, to, be, described, solely, by, its, intensity, and, width, instead, of, the, entire, shape, being, characterized, the, integrated, intensity, obtained, by, integrating, the, area, under, the, absorption, line, is, proportional, to, the, amount, of, the, absorbing, substance, present, the, intensity, is, also, related, to, the, temperature, of, the, substance, and, the, quantum, mechanical, interaction, between, the, radiation, and, the, absorber, this, interaction, is, quantified, by, the, transition, moment, and, depends, on, the, particular, lower, state, the, transition, starts, from, and, the, upper, state, it, is, connected, to, the, width, of, absorption, lines, may, be, determined, by, the, spectrometer, used, to, record, it, a, spectrometer, has, an, inherent, limit, on, how, narrow, a, line, it, can, resolve, and, so, the, observed, width, may, be, at, this, limit, if, the, width, is, larger, than, the, resolution, limit, then, it, is, primarily, determined, by, the, environment, of, the, absorber, a, liquid, or, solid, absorber, in, which, neighboring, molecules, strongly, interact, with, one, another, tends, to, have, broader, absorption, lines, than, a, gas, increasing, the, temperature, or, pressure, of, the, absorbing, material, will, also, tend, to, increase, the, line, width, it, is, also, common, for, several, neighboring, transitions, to, be, close, enough, to, one, another, that, their, lines, overlap, and, the, resulting, overall, line, is, therefore, broader, yet, absorption, and, transmission, spectra, represent, equivalent, information, and, one, can, be, calculated, from, the, other, through, a, mathematical, transformation, a, transmission, spectrum, will, have, its, maximum, intensities, at, wavelengths, where, the, absorption, is, weakest, because, more, light, is, transmitted, through, the, sample, an, absorption, spectrum, will, have, its, maximum, intensities, at, wavelengths, where, the, absorption, is, strongest, emission, is, a, process, by, which, a, substance, releases, energy, in, the, form, of, electromagnetic, radiation, emission, can, occur, at, any, frequency, at, which, absorption, can, occur, and, this, allows, the, absorption, lines, to, be, determined, from, an, emission, spectrum, the, emission, spectrum, will, typically, have, a, quite, different, intensity, pattern, from, the, absorption, spectrum, though, so, the, two, are, not, equivalent, the, absorption, spectrum, can, be, calculated, from, the, emission, spectrum, using, einstein, coefficients, the, scattering, and, reflection, spectra, of, a, material, are, influenced, by, both, its, refractive, index, and, its, absorption, spectrum, in, an, optical, context, the, absorption, spectrum, is, typically, quantified, by, the, extinction, coefficient, and, the, extinction, and, index, coefficients, are, quantitatively, related, through, the, kramers, kronig, relations, therefore, the, absorption, spectrum, can, be, derived, from, a, scattering, or, reflection, spectrum, this, typically, requires, simplifying, assumptions, or, models, and, so, the, derived, absorption, spectrum, is, an, approximation, absorption, spectroscopy, is, useful, in, chemical, analysis, because, of, its, specificity, and, its, quantitative, nature, the, specificity, of, absorption, spectra, allows, compounds, to, be, distinguished, from, one, another, in, a, mixture, making, absorption, spectroscopy, useful, in, wide, variety, of, applications, for, instance, infrared, gas, analyzers, can, be, used, to, identify, the, presence, of, pollutants, in, the, air, distinguishing, the, pollutant, from, nitrogen, oxygen, water, and, other, expected, constituents, the, specificity, also, allows, unknown, samples, to, be, identified, by, comparing, a, measured, spectrum, with, a, library, of, reference, spectra, in, many, cases, it, is, possible, to, determine, qualitative, information, about, a, sample, even, if, it, is, not, in, a, library, infrared, spectra, for, instance, have, characteristics, absorption, bands, that, indicate, if, carbon, hydrogen, or, carbon, oxygen, bonds, are, present, an, absorption, spectrum, can, be, quantitatively, related, to, the, amount, of, material, present, using, the, beer, lambert, law, determining, the, absolute, concentration, of, a, compound, requires, knowledge, of, the, compound, s, absorption, coefficient, the, absorption, coefficient, for, some, compounds, is, available, from, reference, sources, and, it, can, also, be, determined, by, measuring, the, spectrum, of, a, calibration, standard, with, a, known, concentration, of, the, target, one, of, the, unique, advantages, of, spectroscopy, as, an, analytical, technique, is, that, measurements, can, be, made, without, bringing, the, instrument, and, sample, into, contact, radiation, that, travels, between, a, sample, and, an, instrument, will, contain, the, spectral, information, so, the, measurement, can, be, made, remotely, remote, spectral, sensing, is, valuable, in, many, situations, for, example, measurements, can, be, made, in, toxic, or, hazardous, environments, without, placing, an, operator, or, instrument, at, risk, also, sample, material, does, not, have, to, be, brought, into, contact, with, the, instrument, preventing, possible, cross, contamination, remote, spectral, measurements, present, several, challenges, compared, to, laboratory, measurements, the, space, in, between, the, sample, of, interest, and, the, instrument, may, also, have, spectral, absorptions, these, absorptions, can, mask, or, confound, the, absorption, spectrum, of, the, sample, these, background, interferences, may, also, vary, over, time, the, source, of, radiation, in, remote, measurements, is, often, an, environmental, source, such, as, sunlight, or, the, thermal, radiation, from, a, warm, object, and, this, makes, it, necessary, to, distinguish, spectral, absorption, from, changes, in, the, source, spectrum, to, simplify, these, challenges, differential, optical, absorption, spectroscopy, has, gained, some, popularity, as, it, focusses, on, differential, absorption, features, and, omits, broad, band, absorption, such, as, aerosol, extinction, and, extinction, due, to, rayleigh, scattering, this, method, is, applied, to, ground, based, airborne, and, satellite, based, measurements, some, ground, based, methods, provide, the, possibility, to, retrieve, tropospheric, and, stratospheric, trace, gas, profiles, astronomical, spectroscopy, is, a, particularly, significant, type, of, remote, spectral, sensing, in, this, case, the, objects, and, samples, of, interest, are, so, distant, from, earth, that, electromagnetic, radiation, is, the, only, means, available, to, measure, them, astronomical, spectra, contain, both, absorption, and, emission, spectral, information, absorption, spectroscopy, has, been, particularly, important, for, understanding, interstellar, clouds, and, determining, that, some, of, them, contain, molecules, absorption, spectroscopy, is, also, employed, in, the, study, of, extrasolar, planets, detection, of, extrasolar, planets, by, transit, photometry, also, measures, their, absorption, spectrum, and, allows, for, the, determination, of, the, planet, s, atmospheric, composition, temperature, pressure, and, scale, height, and, hence, allows, also, for, the, determination, of, the, planet, s, mass, theoretical, models, principally, quantum, mechanical, models, allow, for, the, absorption, spectra, of, atoms, and, molecules, to, be, related, to, other, physical, properties, such, as, electronic, structure, atomic, or, molecular, mass, and, molecular, geometry, therefore, measurements, of, the, absorption, spectrum, are, used, to, determine, these, other, properties, microwave, spectroscopy, for, example, allows, for, the, determination, of, bond, lengths, and, angles, with, high, precision, in, addition, spectral, measurements, can, be, used, to, determine, the, accuracy, of, theoretical, predictions, for, example, the, lamb, shift, measured, in, the, hydrogen, atomic, absorption, spectrum, was, not, expected, to, exist, at, the, time, it, was, measured, its, discovery, spurred, and, guided, the, development, of, quantum, electrodynamics, and, measurements, of, the, lamb, shift, are, now, used, to, determine, the, fine, structure, constant, the, most, straightforward, approach, to, absorption, spectroscopy, is, to, generate, radiation, with, a, source, measure, a, reference, spectrum, of, that, radiation, with, a, detector, and, then, re, measure, the, sample, spectrum, after, placing, the, material, of, interest, in, between, the, source, and, detector, the, two, measured, spectra, can, then, be, combined, to, determine, the, material, s, absorption, spectrum, the, sample, spectrum, alone, is, not, sufficient, to, determine, the, absorption, spectrum, because, it, will, be, affected, by, the, experimental, conditions, the, spectrum, of, the, source, the, absorption, spectra, of, other, materials, between, the, source, and, detector, and, the, wavelength, dependent, characteristics, of, the, detector, the, reference, spectrum, will, be, affected, in, the, same, way, though, by, these, experimental, conditions, and, therefore, the, combination, yields, the, absorption, spectrum, of, the, material, alone, a, wide, variety, of, radiation, sources, are, employed, in, order, to, cover, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, for, spectroscopy, it, is, generally, desirable, for, a, source, to, cover, a, broad, swath, of, wavelengths, in, order, to, measure, a, broad, region, of, the, absorption, spectrum, some, sources, inherently, emit, a, broad, spectrum, examples, of, these, include, globars, or, other, black, body, sources, in, the, infrared, mercury, lamps, in, the, visible, and, ultraviolet, and, x, ray, tubes, one, recently, developed, novel, source, of, broad, spectrum, radiation, is, synchrotron, radiation, which, covers, all, of, these, spectral, regions, other, radiation, sources, generate, a, narrow, spectrum, but, the, emission, wavelength, can, be, tuned, to, cover, a, spectral, range, examples, of, these, include, klystrons, in, the, microwave, region, and, lasers, across, the, infrared, visible, and, ultraviolet, region, though, not, all, lasers, have, tunable, wavelengths, the, detector, employed, to, measure, the, radiation, power, will, also, depend, on, the, wavelength, range, of, interest, most, detectors, are, sensitive, to, a, fairly, broad, spectral, range, and, the, sensor, selected, will, often, depend, more, on, the, sensitivity, and, noise, requirements, of, a, given, measurement, examples, of, detectors, common, in, spectroscopy, include, heterodyne, receivers, in, the, microwave, bolometers, in, the, millimeter, wave, and, infrared, mercury, cadmium, telluride, and, other, cooled, semiconductor, detectors, in, the, infrared, and, photodiodes, and, photomultiplier, tubes, in, the, visible, and, ultraviolet, if, both, the, source, and, the, detector, cover, a, broad, spectral, region, then, it, is, also, necessary, to, introduce, a, means, of, resolving, the, wavelength, of, the, radiation, in, order, to, determine, the, spectrum, often, a, spectrograph, is, used, to, spatially, separate, the, wavelengths, of, radiation, so, that, the, power, at, each, wavelength, can, be, measured, independently, it, is, also, common, to, employ, interferometry, to, determine, the, spectrum, fourier, transform, infrared, spectroscopy, is, a, widely, used, implementation, of, this, technique, two, other, issues, that, must, be, considered, in, setting, up, an, absorption, spectroscopy, experiment, include, the, optics, used, to, direct, the, radiation, and, the, means, of, holding, or, containing, the, sample, material, called, a, cuvette, or, cell, for, most, uv, visible, and, nir, measurements, the, use, of, precision, quartz, cuvettes, are, necessary, in, both, cases, it, is, important, to, select, materials, that, have, relatively, little, absorption, of, their, own, in, the, wavelength, range, of, interest, the, absorption, of, other, materials, could, interfere, with, or, mask, the, absorption, from, the, sample, for, instance, in, several, wavelength, ranges, it, is, necessary, to, measure, the, sample, under, vacuum, or, in, a, noble, gas, environment, because, gases, in, the, atmosphere, have, interfering, absorption, features
