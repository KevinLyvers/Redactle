in, fluid, dynamics, the, reynolds, number, re, is, a, dimensionless, quantity, that, helps, predict, fluid, flow, patterns, in, different, situations, by, measuring, the, ratio, between, inertial, and, viscous, forces, at, low, reynolds, numbers, flows, tend, to, be, dominated, by, laminar, sheet, like, flow, while, at, high, reynolds, numbers, flows, tend, to, be, turbulent, the, turbulence, results, from, differences, in, the, fluid, s, speed, and, direction, which, may, sometimes, intersect, or, even, move, counter, to, the, overall, direction, of, the, flow, eddy, currents, these, eddy, currents, begin, to, churn, the, flow, using, up, energy, in, the, process, which, for, liquids, increases, the, chances, of, cavitation, the, reynolds, number, has, wide, applications, ranging, from, liquid, flow, in, a, pipe, to, the, passage, of, air, over, an, aircraft, wing, it, is, used, to, predict, the, transition, from, laminar, to, turbulent, flow, and, is, used, in, the, scaling, of, similar, but, different, sized, flow, situations, such, as, between, an, aircraft, model, in, a, wind, tunnel, and, the, full, size, version, the, predictions, of, the, onset, of, turbulence, and, the, ability, to, calculate, scaling, effects, can, be, used, to, help, predict, fluid, behavior, on, a, larger, scale, such, as, in, local, or, global, air, or, water, movement, and, thereby, the, associated, meteorological, and, climatological, effects, the, concept, was, introduced, by, george, stokes, in, 1851, but, the, reynolds, number, was, named, by, arnold, sommerfeld, in, 1908, after, osborne, reynolds, 1842, 1912, who, popularized, its, use, in, 1883, the, reynolds, number, is, the, ratio, of, inertial, forces, to, viscous, forces, within, a, fluid, that, is, subjected, to, relative, internal, movement, due, to, different, fluid, velocities, a, region, where, these, forces, change, behavior, is, known, as, a, boundary, layer, such, as, the, bounding, surface, in, the, interior, of, a, pipe, a, similar, effect, is, created, by, the, introduction, of, a, stream, of, high, velocity, fluid, into, a, low, velocity, fluid, such, as, the, hot, gases, emitted, from, a, flame, in, air, this, relative, movement, generates, fluid, friction, which, is, a, factor, in, developing, turbulent, flow, counteracting, this, effect, is, the, viscosity, of, the, fluid, which, tends, to, inhibit, turbulence, the, reynolds, number, quantifies, the, relative, importance, of, these, two, types, of, forces, for, given, flow, conditions, and, is, a, guide, to, when, turbulent, flow, will, occur, in, a, particular, situation, this, ability, to, predict, the, onset, of, turbulent, flow, is, an, important, design, tool, for, equipment, such, as, piping, systems, or, aircraft, wings, but, the, reynolds, number, is, also, used, in, scaling, of, fluid, dynamics, problems, and, is, used, to, determine, dynamic, similitude, between, two, different, cases, of, fluid, flow, such, as, between, a, model, aircraft, and, its, full, size, version, such, scaling, is, not, linear, and, the, application, of, reynolds, numbers, to, both, situations, allows, scaling, factors, to, be, developed, with, respect, to, laminar, and, turbulent, flow, regimes, the, reynolds, number, is, defined, as, r, e, u, l, u, l, displaystyle, mathrm, re, frac, ul, nu, frac, rho, ul, mu, where, the, reynolds, number, can, be, defined, for, several, different, situations, where, a, fluid, is, in, relative, motion, to, a, surface, these, definitions, generally, include, the, fluid, properties, of, density, and, viscosity, plus, a, velocity, and, a, characteristic, length, or, characteristic, dimension, l, in, the, above, equation, this, dimension, is, a, matter, of, convention, for, example, radius, and, diameter, are, equally, valid, to, describe, spheres, or, circles, but, one, is, chosen, by, convention, for, aircraft, or, ships, the, length, or, width, can, be, used, for, flow, in, a, pipe, or, for, a, sphere, moving, in, a, fluid, the, internal, diameter, is, generally, used, today, other, shapes, such, as, rectangular, pipes, or, non, spherical, objects, have, an, equivalent, diameter, defined, for, fluids, of, variable, density, such, as, compressible, gases, or, fluids, of, variable, viscosity, such, as, non, newtonian, fluids, special, rules, apply, the, velocity, may, also, be, a, matter, of, convention, in, some, circumstances, notably, stirred, vessels, in, practice, matching, the, reynolds, number, is, not, on, its, own, sufficient, to, guarantee, similitude, fluid, flow, is, generally, chaotic, and, very, small, changes, to, shape, and, surface, roughness, of, bounding, surfaces, can, result, in, very, different, flows, nevertheless, reynolds, numbers, are, a, very, important, guide, and, are, widely, used, if, we, know, that, the, relevant, physical, quantities, in, a, physical, system, are, only, u, l, displaystyle, rho, u, l, mu, then, the, reynolds, number, is, essentially, fixed, by, the, buckingham, theorem, in, detail, since, there, are, 4, quantities, u, l, displaystyle, rho, u, l, mu, but, they, have, only, 3, dimensions, length, time, mass, we, can, consider, x, 1, u, x, 2, l, x, 3, x, 4, displaystyle, rho, x, 1, u, x, 2, l, x, 3, mu, x, 4, where, x, 1, x, 4, displaystyle, x, 1, x, 4, are, real, numbers, setting, the, three, dimensions, of, x, 1, u, x, 2, l, x, 3, x, 4, displaystyle, rho, x, 1, u, x, 2, l, x, 3, mu, x, 4, to, zero, we, obtain, 3, independent, linear, constraints, so, the, solution, space, has, 1, dimension, and, it, is, spanned, by, the, vector, 1, 1, 1, 1, displaystyle, 1, 1, 1, 1, thus, any, dimensionless, quantity, constructed, out, of, u, l, displaystyle, rho, u, l, mu, is, a, function, of, u, l, 1, displaystyle, rho, ul, mu, 1, the, reynolds, number, alternatively, we, can, take, the, incompressible, navier, stokes, equations, convective, form, u, t, u, u, 2, u, 1, p, g, displaystyle, frac, partial, mathbf, u, partial, t, mathbf, u, cdot, nabla, mathbf, u, nu, nabla, 2, mathbf, u, frac, 1, rho, nabla, p, mathbf, g, remove, the, gravity, term, g, displaystyle, mathbf, g, then, the, left, side, consists, of, inertial, force, u, t, u, u, displaystyle, frac, partial, mathbf, u, partial, t, mathbf, u, cdot, nabla, mathbf, u, and, viscous, force, 2, u, displaystyle, nu, nabla, 2, mathbf, u, their, ratio, has, the, order, of, u, u, 2, u, u, 2, l, u, l, 2, u, l, displaystyle, frac, mathbf, u, cdot, nabla, mathbf, u, nu, nabla, 2, mathbf, u, sim, frac, u, 2, l, nu, u, l, 2, frac, ul, nu, the, reynolds, number, this, argument, is, written, out, in, detail, on, the, scallop, theorem, page, the, reynolds, number, can, be, obtained, when, one, uses, the, nondimensional, form, of, the, incompressible, navier, stokes, equations, for, a, newtonian, fluid, expressed, in, terms, of, the, lagrangian, derivative, each, term, in, the, above, equation, has, the, units, of, a, body, force, force, per, unit, volume, with, the, same, dimensions, of, a, density, times, an, acceleration, each, term, is, thus, dependent, on, the, exact, measurements, of, a, flow, when, one, renders, the, equation, nondimensional, that, is, when, we, multiply, it, by, a, factor, with, inverse, units, of, the, base, equation, we, obtain, a, form, that, does, not, depend, directly, on, the, physical, sizes, one, possible, way, to, obtain, a, nondimensional, equation, is, to, multiply, the, whole, equation, by, the, factor, where, if, we, now, set, we, can, rewrite, the, navier, stokes, equation, without, dimensions, where, the, term, lv, 1, re, finally, dropping, the, primes, for, ease, of, reading, this, is, why, mathematically, all, newtonian, incompressible, flows, with, the, same, reynolds, number, are, comparable, notice, also, that, in, the, above, equation, the, viscous, terms, vanish, for, re, thus, flows, with, high, reynolds, numbers, are, approximately, inviscid, in, the, free, stream, osborne, reynolds, famously, studied, the, conditions, in, which, the, flow, of, fluid, in, pipes, transitioned, from, laminar, flow, to, turbulent, flow, in, his, 1883, paper, reynolds, described, the, transition, from, laminar, to, turbulent, flow, in, a, classic, experiment, in, which, he, examined, the, behaviour, of, water, flow, under, different, flow, velocities, using, a, small, stream, of, dyed, water, introduced, into, the, centre, of, clear, water, flow, in, a, larger, pipe, the, larger, pipe, was, glass, so, the, behaviour, of, the, layer, of, the, dyed, stream, could, be, observed, at, the, end, of, this, pipe, there, was, a, flow, control, valve, used, to, vary, the, water, velocity, inside, the, tube, when, the, velocity, was, low, the, dyed, layer, remained, distinct, throughout, the, entire, length, of, the, large, tube, when, the, velocity, was, increased, the, layer, broke, up, at, a, given, point, and, diffused, throughout, the, fluid, s, cross, section, the, point, at, which, this, happened, was, the, transition, point, from, laminar, to, turbulent, flow, from, these, experiments, came, the, dimensionless, reynolds, number, for, dynamic, similarity, the, ratio, of, inertial, forces, to, viscous, forces, reynolds, also, proposed, what, is, now, known, as, the, reynolds, averaging, of, turbulent, flows, where, quantities, such, as, velocity, are, expressed, as, the, sum, of, mean, and, fluctuating, components, such, averaging, allows, for, bulk, description, of, turbulent, flow, for, example, using, the, reynolds, averaged, navier, stokes, equations, for, flow, in, a, pipe, or, tube, the, reynolds, number, is, generally, defined, as, where, for, shapes, such, as, squares, rectangular, or, annular, ducts, where, the, height, and, width, are, comparable, the, characteristic, dimension, for, internal, flow, situations, is, taken, to, be, the, hydraulic, diameter, d, h, defined, as, where, a, is, the, cross, sectional, area, and, p, is, the, wetted, perimeter, the, wetted, perimeter, for, a, channel, is, the, total, perimeter, of, all, channel, walls, that, are, in, contact, with, the, flow, this, means, that, the, length, of, the, channel, exposed, to, air, is, not, included, in, the, wetted, perimeter, for, a, circular, pipe, the, hydraulic, diameter, is, exactly, equal, to, the, inside, pipe, diameter, for, an, annular, duct, such, as, the, outer, channel, in, a, tube, in, tube, heat, exchanger, the, hydraulic, diameter, can, be, shown, algebraically, to, reduce, to, where, for, calculation, involving, flow, in, non, circular, ducts, the, hydraulic, diameter, can, be, substituted, for, the, diameter, of, a, circular, duct, with, reasonable, accuracy, if, the, aspect, ratio, ar, of, the, duct, cross, section, remains, in, the, range, 1, 4, ar, 4, in, boundary, layer, flow, over, a, flat, plate, experiments, confirm, that, after, a, certain, length, of, flow, a, laminar, boundary, layer, will, become, unstable, and, turbulent, this, instability, occurs, across, different, scales, and, with, different, fluids, usually, when, re, x, 5, 10, 5, where, x, is, the, distance, from, the, leading, edge, of, the, flat, plate, and, the, flow, velocity, is, the, freestream, velocity, of, the, fluid, outside, the, boundary, layer, for, flow, in, a, pipe, of, diameter, d, experimental, observations, show, that, for, fully, developed, flow, laminar, flow, occurs, when, re, d, 2300, and, turbulent, flow, occurs, when, re, d, 2900, at, the, lower, end, of, this, range, a, continuous, turbulent, flow, will, form, but, only, at, a, very, long, distance, from, the, inlet, of, the, pipe, the, flow, in, between, will, begin, to, transition, from, laminar, to, turbulent, and, then, back, to, laminar, at, irregular, intervals, called, intermittent, flow, this, is, due, to, the, different, speeds, and, conditions, of, the, fluid, in, different, areas, of, the, pipe, s, cross, section, depending, on, other, factors, such, as, pipe, roughness, and, flow, uniformity, laminar, flow, tends, to, dominate, in, the, fast, moving, center, of, the, pipe, while, slower, moving, turbulent, flow, dominates, near, the, wall, as, the, reynolds, number, increases, the, continuous, turbulent, flow, moves, closer, to, the, inlet, and, the, intermittency, in, between, increases, until, the, flow, becomes, fully, turbulent, at, re, d, 2900, this, result, is, generalized, to, non, circular, channels, using, the, hydraulic, diameter, allowing, a, transition, reynolds, number, to, be, calculated, for, other, shapes, of, channel, these, transition, reynolds, numbers, are, also, called, critical, reynolds, numbers, and, were, studied, by, osborne, reynolds, around, 1895, the, critical, reynolds, number, is, different, for, every, geometry, for, a, fluid, moving, between, two, plane, parallel, surfaces, where, the, width, is, much, greater, than, the, space, between, the, plates, then, the, characteristic, dimension, is, equal, to, the, distance, between, the, plates, this, is, consistent, with, the, annular, duct, and, rectangular, duct, cases, above, taken, to, a, limiting, aspect, ratio, for, calculating, the, flow, of, liquid, with, a, free, surface, the, hydraulic, radius, must, be, determined, this, is, the, cross, sectional, area, of, the, channel, divided, by, the, wetted, perimeter, for, a, semi, circular, channel, it, is, a, quarter, of, the, diameter, in, case, of, full, pipe, flow, for, a, rectangular, channel, the, hydraulic, radius, is, the, cross, sectional, area, divided, by, the, wetted, perimeter, some, texts, then, use, a, characteristic, dimension, that, is, four, times, the, hydraulic, radius, chosen, because, it, gives, the, same, value, of, re, for, the, onset, of, turbulence, as, in, pipe, flow, while, others, use, the, hydraulic, radius, as, the, characteristic, length, scale, with, consequently, different, values, of, re, for, transition, and, turbulent, flow, reynolds, numbers, are, used, in, airfoil, design, to, among, other, things, manage, scale, effect, when, computing, comparing, characteristics, a, tiny, wing, scaled, to, be, huge, will, perform, differently, fluid, dynamicists, define, the, chord, reynolds, number, r, vc, where, v, is, the, flight, speed, c, is, the, chord, length, and, is, the, kinematic, viscosity, of, the, fluid, in, which, the, airfoil, operates, which, is, 1, 460, 10, 5, m, 2, s, for, the, atmosphere, at, sea, level, in, some, special, studies, a, characteristic, length, other, than, chord, may, be, used, rare, is, the, span, reynolds, number, which, is, not, to, be, confused, with, span, wise, stations, on, a, wing, where, chord, is, still, used, the, reynolds, number, for, an, object, moving, in, a, fluid, called, the, particle, reynolds, number, and, often, denoted, re, p, characterizes, the, nature, of, the, surrounding, flow, and, its, fall, velocity, where, the, viscosity, is, naturally, high, such, as, polymer, solutions, and, polymer, melts, flow, is, normally, laminar, the, reynolds, number, is, very, small, and, stokes, law, can, be, used, to, measure, the, viscosity, of, the, fluid, spheres, are, allowed, to, fall, through, the, fluid, and, they, reach, the, terminal, velocity, quickly, from, which, the, viscosity, can, be, determined, the, laminar, flow, of, polymer, solutions, is, exploited, by, animals, such, as, fish, and, dolphins, who, exude, viscous, solutions, from, their, skin, to, aid, flow, over, their, bodies, while, swimming, it, has, been, used, in, yacht, racing, by, owners, who, want, to, gain, a, speed, advantage, by, pumping, a, polymer, solution, such, as, low, molecular, weight, polyoxyethylene, in, water, over, the, wetted, surface, of, the, hull, it, is, however, a, problem, for, mixing, polymers, because, turbulence, is, needed, to, distribute, fine, filler, for, example, through, the, material, inventions, such, as, the, cavity, transfer, mixer, have, been, developed, to, produce, multiple, folds, into, a, moving, melt, so, as, to, improve, mixing, efficiency, the, device, can, be, fitted, onto, extruders, to, aid, mixing, for, a, sphere, in, a, fluid, the, characteristic, length, scale, is, the, diameter, of, the, sphere, and, the, characteristic, velocity, is, that, of, the, sphere, relative, to, the, fluid, some, distance, away, from, the, sphere, such, that, the, motion, of, the, sphere, does, not, disturb, that, reference, parcel, of, fluid, the, density, and, viscosity, are, those, belonging, to, the, fluid, note, that, purely, laminar, flow, only, exists, up, to, re, 10, under, this, definition, under, the, condition, of, low, re, the, relationship, between, force, and, speed, of, motion, is, given, by, stokes, law, at, higher, reynolds, numbers, the, drag, on, a, sphere, depends, on, surface, roughness, thus, for, example, adding, dimples, on, the, surface, of, a, golf, ball, causes, the, boundary, layer, on, the, upstream, side, of, the, ball, to, transition, from, laminar, to, turbulent, the, turbulent, boundary, layer, is, able, to, remain, attached, to, the, surface, of, the, ball, much, longer, than, a, laminar, boundary, and, so, creates, a, narrower, low, pressure, wake, and, hence, less, pressure, drag, the, reduction, in, pressure, drag, causes, the, ball, to, travel, farther, the, equation, for, a, rectangular, object, is, identical, to, that, of, a, sphere, with, the, object, being, approximated, as, an, ellipsoid, and, the, axis, of, length, being, chosen, as, the, characteristic, length, scale, such, considerations, are, important, in, natural, streams, for, example, where, there, are, few, perfectly, spherical, grains, for, grains, in, which, measurement, of, each, axis, is, impractical, sieve, diameters, are, used, instead, as, the, characteristic, particle, length, scale, both, approximations, alter, the, values, of, the, critical, reynolds, number, the, particle, reynolds, number, is, important, in, determining, the, fall, velocity, of, a, particle, when, the, particle, reynolds, number, indicates, laminar, flow, stokes, law, can, be, used, to, calculate, its, fall, velocity, or, settling, velocity, when, the, particle, reynolds, number, indicates, turbulent, flow, a, turbulent, drag, law, must, be, constructed, to, model, the, appropriate, settling, velocity, for, fluid, flow, through, a, bed, of, approximately, spherical, particles, of, diameter, d, in, contact, if, the, voidage, is, and, the, superficial, velocity, is, v, s, the, reynolds, number, can, be, defined, as, or, or, the, choice, of, equation, depends, on, the, system, involved, the, first, is, successful, in, correlating, the, data, for, various, types, of, packed, and, fluidized, beds, the, second, reynolds, number, suits, for, the, liquid, phase, data, while, the, third, was, found, successful, in, correlating, the, fluidized, bed, data, being, first, introduced, for, liquid, fluidized, bed, system, laminar, conditions, apply, up, to, re, 10, fully, turbulent, from, re, 2000, in, a, cylindrical, vessel, stirred, by, a, central, rotating, paddle, turbine, or, propeller, the, characteristic, dimension, is, the, diameter, of, the, agitator, d, the, velocity, v, is, nd, where, n, is, the, rotational, speed, in, rad, per, second, then, the, reynolds, number, is, the, system, is, fully, turbulent, for, values, of, re, above, 10, 000, pressure, drops, seen, for, fully, developed, flow, of, fluids, through, pipes, can, be, predicted, using, the, moody, diagram, which, plots, the, darcy, weisbach, friction, factor, f, against, reynolds, number, re, and, relative, roughness, d, the, diagram, clearly, shows, the, laminar, transition, and, turbulent, flow, regimes, as, reynolds, number, increases, the, nature, of, pipe, flow, is, strongly, dependent, on, whether, the, flow, is, laminar, or, turbulent, in, order, for, two, flows, to, be, similar, they, must, have, the, same, geometry, and, equal, reynolds, and, euler, numbers, when, comparing, fluid, behavior, at, corresponding, points, in, a, model, and, a, full, scale, flow, the, following, holds, where, r, e, m, displaystyle, mathrm, re, text, m, is, the, reynolds, number, for, the, model, and, r, e, displaystyle, mathrm, re, is, full, scale, reynolds, number, and, similarly, for, the, euler, numbers, the, model, numbers, and, design, numbers, should, be, in, the, same, proportion, hence, this, allows, engineers, to, perform, experiments, with, reduced, scale, models, in, water, channels, or, wind, tunnels, and, correlate, the, data, to, the, actual, flows, saving, on, costs, during, experimentation, and, on, lab, time, note, that, true, dynamic, similitude, may, require, matching, other, dimensionless, numbers, as, well, such, as, the, mach, number, used, in, compressible, flows, or, the, froude, number, that, governs, open, channel, flows, some, flows, involve, more, dimensionless, parameters, than, can, be, practically, satisfied, with, the, available, apparatus, and, fluids, so, one, is, forced, to, decide, which, parameters, are, most, important, for, experimental, flow, modeling, to, be, useful, it, requires, a, fair, amount, of, experience, and, judgment, of, the, engineer, an, example, where, the, mere, reynolds, number, is, not, sufficient, for, the, similarity, of, flows, or, even, the, flow, regime, laminar, or, turbulent, are, bounded, flows, i, e, flows, that, are, restricted, by, walls, or, other, boundaries, a, classical, example, of, this, is, the, taylor, couette, flow, where, the, dimensionless, ratio, of, radii, of, bounding, cylinders, is, also, important, and, many, technical, applications, where, these, distinctions, play, an, important, role, principles, of, these, restrictions, were, developed, by, maurice, marie, alfred, couette, and, geoffrey, ingram, taylor, and, developed, further, by, floris, takens, and, david, ruelle, in, a, turbulent, flow, there, is, a, range, of, scales, of, the, time, varying, fluid, motion, the, size, of, the, largest, scales, of, fluid, motion, sometimes, called, eddies, are, set, by, the, overall, geometry, of, the, flow, for, instance, in, an, industrial, smoke, stack, the, largest, scales, of, fluid, motion, are, as, big, as, the, diameter, of, the, stack, itself, the, size, of, the, smallest, scales, is, set, by, the, reynolds, number, as, the, reynolds, number, increases, smaller, and, smaller, scales, of, the, flow, are, visible, in, a, smokestack, the, smoke, may, appear, to, have, many, very, small, velocity, perturbations, or, eddies, in, addition, to, large, bulky, eddies, in, this, sense, the, reynolds, number, is, an, indicator, of, the, range, of, scales, in, the, flow, the, higher, the, reynolds, number, the, greater, the, range, of, scales, the, largest, eddies, will, always, be, the, same, size, the, smallest, eddies, are, determined, by, the, reynolds, number, what, is, the, explanation, for, this, phenomenon, a, large, reynolds, number, indicates, that, viscous, forces, are, not, important, at, large, scales, of, the, flow, with, a, strong, predominance, of, inertial, forces, over, viscous, forces, the, largest, scales, of, fluid, motion, are, undamped, there, is, not, enough, viscosity, to, dissipate, their, motions, the, kinetic, energy, must, cascade, from, these, large, scales, to, progressively, smaller, scales, until, a, level, is, reached, for, which, the, scale, is, small, enough, for, viscosity, to, become, important, that, is, viscous, forces, become, of, the, order, of, inertial, ones, it, is, at, these, small, scales, where, the, dissipation, of, energy, by, viscous, action, finally, takes, place, the, reynolds, number, indicates, at, what, scale, this, viscous, dissipation, occurs, poiseuille, s, law, on, blood, circulation, in, the, body, is, dependent, on, laminar, flow, in, turbulent, flow, the, flow, rate, is, proportional, to, the, square, root, of, the, pressure, gradient, as, opposed, to, its, direct, proportionality, to, pressure, gradient, in, laminar, flow, using, the, definition, of, the, reynolds, number, we, can, see, that, a, large, diameter, with, rapid, flow, where, the, density, of, the, blood, is, high, tends, towards, turbulence, rapid, changes, in, vessel, diameter, may, lead, to, turbulent, flow, for, instance, when, a, narrower, vessel, widens, to, a, larger, one, furthermore, a, bulge, of, atheroma, may, be, the, cause, of, turbulent, flow, where, audible, turbulence, may, be, detected, with, a, stethoscope, reynolds, number, interpretation, has, been, extended, into, the, area, of, arbitrary, complex, systems, such, as, financial, flows, nonlinear, networks, etc, in, the, latter, case, an, artificial, viscosity, is, reduced, to, a, nonlinear, mechanism, of, energy, distribution, in, complex, network, media, reynolds, number, then, represents, a, basic, control, parameter, that, expresses, a, balance, between, injected, and, dissipated, energy, flows, for, an, open, boundary, system, it, has, been, shown, that, reynolds, critical, regime, separates, two, types, of, phase, space, motion, accelerator, attractor, and, decelerator, high, reynolds, number, leads, to, a, chaotic, regime, transition, only, in, frame, of, strange, attractor, model, there, are, many, dimensionless, numbers, in, fluid, mechanics, the, reynolds, number, measures, the, ratio, of, advection, and, diffusion, effects, on, structures, in, the, velocity, field, and, is, therefore, closely, related, to, p, clet, numbers,
