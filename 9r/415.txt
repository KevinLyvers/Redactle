ytterbium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, yb, and, atomic, number, 70, it, is, a, metal, the, fourteenth, and, penultimate, element, in, the, lanthanide, series, which, is, the, basis, of, the, relative, stability, of, its, 2, oxidation, state, like, the, other, lanthanides, its, most, common, oxidation, state, is, 3, as, in, its, oxide, halides, and, other, compounds, in, aqueous, solution, like, compounds, of, other, late, lanthanides, soluble, ytterbium, compounds, form, complexes, with, nine, water, molecules, because, of, its, closed, shell, electron, configuration, its, density, melting, point, and, boiling, point, are, much, lower, than, those, of, most, other, lanthanides, in, 1878, swiss, chemist, jean, charles, galissard, de, marignac, separated, from, the, rare, earth, erbia, another, independent, component, which, he, called, ytterbia, for, ytterby, the, village, in, sweden, near, where, he, found, the, new, component, of, erbium, he, suspected, that, ytterbia, was, a, compound, of, a, new, element, that, he, called, ytterbium, in, total, four, elements, were, named, after, the, village, the, others, being, yttrium, terbium, and, erbium, in, 1907, the, new, earth, lutecia, was, separated, from, ytterbia, from, which, the, element, lutecium, now, lutetium, was, extracted, by, georges, urbain, carl, auer, von, welsbach, and, charles, james, after, some, discussion, marignac, s, name, ytterbium, was, retained, a, relatively, pure, sample, of, the, metal, was, not, obtained, until, 1953, at, present, ytterbium, is, mainly, used, as, a, dopant, of, stainless, steel, or, active, laser, media, and, less, often, as, a, gamma, ray, source, natural, ytterbium, is, a, mixture, of, seven, stable, isotopes, which, altogether, are, present, at, concentrations, of, 0, 3, parts, per, million, this, element, is, mined, in, china, the, united, states, brazil, and, india, in, form, of, the, minerals, monazite, euxenite, and, xenotime, the, ytterbium, concentration, is, low, because, it, is, found, only, among, many, other, rare, earth, elements, moreover, it, is, among, the, least, abundant, once, extracted, and, prepared, ytterbium, is, somewhat, hazardous, as, an, eye, and, skin, irritant, the, metal, is, a, fire, and, explosion, hazard, ytterbium, is, a, soft, malleable, and, ductile, chemical, element, when, freshly, prepared, it, is, less, golden, than, cesium, but, more, golden, in, color, than, just, a, yellow, cast, as, in, metals, like, iridium, it, is, a, rare, earth, element, and, it, is, readily, dissolved, by, the, strong, mineral, acids, ytterbium, has, three, allotropes, labeled, by, the, greek, letters, alpha, beta, and, gamma, their, transformation, temperatures, are, 13, c, and, 795, c, although, the, exact, transformation, temperature, depends, on, the, pressure, and, stress, the, beta, allotrope, 6, 966, g, cm, 3, exists, at, room, temperature, and, it, has, a, face, centered, cubic, crystal, structure, the, high, temperature, gamma, allotrope, 6, 57, g, cm, 3, has, a, body, centered, cubic, crystalline, structure, the, alpha, allotrope, 6, 903, g, cm, 3, has, a, hexagonal, crystalline, structure, and, is, stable, at, low, temperatures, the, beta, allotrope, has, a, metallic, electrical, conductivity, at, normal, atmospheric, pressure, but, it, becomes, a, semiconductor, when, exposed, to, a, pressure, of, about, 16, 000, atmospheres, 1, 6, gpa, its, electrical, resistivity, increases, ten, times, upon, compression, to, 39, 000, atmospheres, 3, 9, gpa, but, then, drops, to, about, 10, of, its, room, temperature, resistivity, at, about, 40, 000, atm, 4, 0, gpa, in, contrast, to, the, other, rare, earth, metals, which, usually, have, antiferromagnetic, and, or, ferromagnetic, properties, at, low, temperatures, ytterbium, is, paramagnetic, at, temperatures, above, 1, 0, kelvin, however, the, alpha, allotrope, is, diamagnetic, with, a, melting, point, of, 824, c, and, a, boiling, point, of, 1196, c, ytterbium, has, the, smallest, liquid, range, of, all, the, metals, contrary, to, most, other, lanthanides, which, have, a, close, packed, hexagonal, lattice, ytterbium, crystallizes, in, the, face, centered, cubic, system, ytterbium, has, a, density, of, 6, 973, g, cm, 3, which, is, significantly, lower, than, those, of, the, neighboring, lanthanides, thulium, 9, 32, g, cm, 3, and, lutetium, 9, 841, g, cm, 3, its, melting, and, boiling, points, are, also, significantly, lower, than, those, of, thulium, and, lutetium, this, is, due, to, the, closed, shell, electron, configuration, of, ytterbium, 4f, 14, 6s, 2, which, causes, only, the, two, 6s, electrons, to, be, available, for, metallic, bonding, in, contrast, to, the, other, lanthanides, where, three, electrons, are, available, and, increases, ytterbium, s, metallic, radius, ytterbium, metal, tarnishes, slowly, in, air, taking, on, a, golden, or, brown, hue, finely, dispersed, ytterbium, readily, oxidizes, in, air, and, under, oxygen, mixtures, of, powdered, ytterbium, with, polytetrafluoroethylene, or, hexachloroethane, burn, with, an, emerald, green, flame, ytterbium, reacts, with, hydrogen, to, form, various, non, stoichiometric, hydrides, ytterbium, dissolves, slowly, in, water, but, quickly, in, acids, liberating, hydrogen, gas, ytterbium, is, quite, electropositive, and, it, reacts, slowly, with, cold, water, and, quite, quickly, with, hot, water, to, form, ytterbium, iii, hydroxide, ytterbium, reacts, with, all, the, halogens, the, ytterbium, iii, ion, absorbs, light, in, the, near, infrared, range, of, wavelengths, but, not, in, visible, light, so, ytterbia, yb, 2, o, 3, is, white, in, color, and, the, salts, of, ytterbium, are, also, colorless, ytterbium, dissolves, readily, in, dilute, sulfuric, acid, to, form, solutions, that, contain, the, colorless, yb, iii, ions, which, exist, as, nonahydrate, complexes, although, usually, trivalent, ytterbium, readily, forms, divalent, compounds, this, behavior, is, unusual, for, lanthanides, which, almost, exclusively, form, compounds, with, an, oxidation, state, of, 3, the, 2, state, has, a, valence, electron, configuration, of, 4, f, 14, because, the, fully, filled, f, shell, gives, more, stability, the, yellow, green, ytterbium, ii, ion, is, a, very, strong, reducing, agent, and, decomposes, water, releasing, hydrogen, gas, and, thus, only, the, colorless, ytterbium, iii, ion, occurs, in, aqueous, solution, samarium, and, thulium, also, behave, this, way, in, the, 2, state, but, europium, ii, is, stable, in, aqueous, solution, ytterbium, metal, behaves, similarly, to, europium, metal, and, the, alkaline, earth, metals, dissolving, in, ammonia, to, form, blue, electride, salts, natural, ytterbium, is, composed, of, seven, stable, isotopes, 168, yb, 170, yb, 171, yb, 172, yb, 173, yb, 174, yb, and, 176, yb, with, 174, yb, being, the, most, common, at, 31, 8, of, the, natural, abundance, thirty, two, radioisotopes, have, been, observed, with, the, most, stable, ones, being, 169, yb, with, a, half, life, of, 32, 0, days, 175, yb, with, a, half, life, of, 4, 18, days, and, 166, yb, with, a, half, life, of, 56, 7, hours, all, of, the, remaining, radioactive, isotopes, have, half, lives, that, are, less, than, two, hours, and, most, of, these, have, half, lives, under, 20, minutes, ytterbium, also, has, 12, meta, states, with, the, most, stable, being, 169m, yb, t, 1, 2, 46, seconds, the, isotopes, of, ytterbium, range, from, 149, yb, to, 187, yb, the, primary, decay, mode, of, ytterbium, isotopes, lighter, than, the, most, abundant, stable, isotope, 174, yb, is, electron, capture, and, the, primary, decay, mode, for, those, heavier, than, 174, yb, is, beta, decay, the, primary, decay, products, of, ytterbium, isotopes, lighter, than, 174, yb, are, thulium, isotopes, and, the, primary, decay, products, of, ytterbium, isotopes, with, heavier, than, 174, yb, are, lutetium, isotopes, ytterbium, is, found, with, other, rare, earth, elements, in, several, rare, minerals, it, is, most, often, recovered, commercially, from, monazite, sand, 0, 03, ytterbium, the, element, is, also, found, in, euxenite, and, xenotime, the, main, mining, areas, are, china, the, united, states, brazil, india, sri, lanka, and, australia, reserves, of, ytterbium, are, estimated, as, one, million, tonnes, ytterbium, is, normally, difficult, to, separate, from, other, rare, earths, but, ion, exchange, and, solvent, extraction, techniques, developed, in, the, mid, to, late, 20th, century, have, simplified, separation, compounds, of, ytterbium, are, rare, and, have, not, yet, been, well, characterized, the, abundance, of, ytterbium, in, the, earth, s, crust, is, about, 3, mg, kg, as, an, even, numbered, lanthanide, in, accordance, with, the, oddo, harkins, rule, ytterbium, is, significantly, more, abundant, than, its, immediate, neighbors, thulium, and, lutetium, which, occur, in, the, same, concentrate, at, levels, of, about, 0, 5, each, the, world, production, of, ytterbium, is, only, about, 50, tonnes, per, year, reflecting, that, it, has, few, commercial, applications, microscopic, traces, of, ytterbium, are, used, as, a, dopant, in, the, yb, yag, laser, a, solid, state, laser, in, which, ytterbium, is, the, element, that, undergoes, stimulated, emission, of, electromagnetic, radiation, ytterbium, is, often, the, most, common, substitute, in, yttrium, minerals, in, very, few, known, cases, occurrences, ytterbium, prevails, over, yttrium, as, e, g, in, xenotime, yb, a, report, of, native, ytterbium, from, the, moon, s, regolith, is, known, it, is, relatively, difficult, to, separate, ytterbium, from, other, lanthanides, due, to, its, similar, properties, as, a, result, the, process, is, somewhat, long, first, minerals, such, as, monazite, or, xenotime, are, dissolved, into, various, acids, such, as, sulfuric, acid, ytterbium, can, then, be, separated, from, other, lanthanides, by, ion, exchange, as, can, other, lanthanides, the, solution, is, then, applied, to, a, resin, to, which, different, lanthanides, bind, with, different, affinities, this, is, then, dissolved, using, complexing, agents, and, due, to, the, different, types, of, bonding, exhibited, by, the, different, lanthanides, it, is, possible, to, isolate, the, compounds, ytterbium, is, separated, from, other, rare, earths, either, by, ion, exchange, or, by, reduction, with, sodium, amalgam, in, the, latter, method, a, buffered, acidic, solution, of, trivalent, rare, earths, is, treated, with, molten, sodium, mercury, alloy, which, reduces, and, dissolves, yb, 3, the, alloy, is, treated, with, hydrochloric, acid, the, metal, is, extracted, from, the, solution, as, oxalate, and, converted, to, oxide, by, heating, the, oxide, is, reduced, to, metal, by, heating, with, lanthanum, aluminium, cerium, or, zirconium, in, high, vacuum, the, metal, is, purified, by, sublimation, and, collected, over, a, condensed, plate, the, chemical, behavior, of, ytterbium, is, similar, to, that, of, the, rest, of, the, lanthanides, most, ytterbium, compounds, are, found, in, the, 3, oxidation, state, and, its, salts, in, this, oxidation, state, are, nearly, colorless, like, europium, samarium, and, thulium, the, trihalides, of, ytterbium, can, be, reduced, to, the, dihalides, by, hydrogen, zinc, dust, or, by, the, addition, of, metallic, ytterbium, the, 2, oxidation, state, occurs, only, in, solid, compounds, and, reacts, in, some, ways, similarly, to, the, alkaline, earth, metal, compounds, for, example, ytterbium, ii, oxide, ybo, shows, the, same, structure, as, calcium, oxide, cao, ytterbium, forms, both, dihalides, and, trihalides, with, the, halogens, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and, iodine, the, dihalides, are, susceptible, to, oxidation, to, the, trihalides, at, room, temperature, and, disproportionate, to, the, trihalides, and, metallic, ytterbium, at, high, temperature, some, ytterbium, halides, are, used, as, reagents, in, organic, synthesis, for, example, ytterbium, iii, chloride, ybcl, 3, is, a, lewis, acid, and, can, be, used, as, a, catalyst, in, the, aldol, and, diels, alder, reactions, ytterbium, ii, iodide, ybi, 2, may, be, used, like, samarium, ii, iodide, as, a, reducing, agent, for, coupling, reactions, ytterbium, iii, fluoride, ybf, 3, is, used, as, an, inert, and, non, toxic, tooth, filling, as, it, continuously, releases, fluoride, ions, which, are, good, for, dental, health, and, is, also, a, good, x, ray, contrast, agent, ytterbium, reacts, with, oxygen, to, form, ytterbium, iii, oxide, yb, 2, o, 3, which, crystallizes, in, the, rare, earth, c, type, sesquioxide, structure, which, is, related, to, the, fluorite, structure, with, one, quarter, of, the, anions, removed, leading, to, ytterbium, atoms, in, two, different, six, coordinate, non, octahedral, environments, ytterbium, iii, oxide, can, be, reduced, to, ytterbium, ii, oxide, ybo, with, elemental, ytterbium, which, crystallizes, in, the, same, structure, as, sodium, chloride, ytterbium, dodecaboride, ybb, 12, is, a, crystalline, material, that, has, been, studied, to, understand, various, electronic, and, structural, properties, of, many, chemically, related, substances, it, is, a, kondo, insulator, it, is, a, quantum, material, under, normal, conditions, the, interior, of, the, bulk, crystal, is, an, insulator, whereas, the, surface, is, highly, conductive, among, the, rare, earth, elements, ytterbium, is, one, of, the, few, that, can, form, a, stable, dodecaboride, a, property, attributed, to, its, comparatively, small, atomic, radius, ytterbium, was, discovered, by, the, swiss, chemist, jean, charles, galissard, de, marignac, in, the, year, 1878, while, examining, samples, of, gadolinite, marignac, found, a, new, component, in, the, earth, then, known, as, erbia, and, he, named, it, ytterbia, for, ytterby, the, swedish, village, near, where, he, found, the, new, component, of, erbium, marignac, suspected, that, ytterbia, was, a, compound, of, a, new, element, that, he, called, ytterbium, in, 1907, the, french, chemist, georges, urbain, separated, marignac, s, ytterbia, into, two, components, neoytterbia, and, lutecia, neoytterbia, later, became, known, as, the, element, ytterbium, and, lutecia, became, known, as, the, element, lutetium, the, austrian, chemist, carl, auer, von, welsbach, independently, isolated, these, elements, from, ytterbia, at, about, the, same, time, but, he, called, them, aldebaranium, ad, after, aldebaran, and, cassiopeium, the, american, chemist, charles, james, also, independently, isolated, these, elements, at, about, the, same, time, urbain, and, welsbach, accused, each, other, of, publishing, results, based, on, the, other, party, the, commission, on, atomic, mass, consisting, of, frank, wigglesworth, clarke, wilhelm, ostwald, and, georges, urbain, which, was, then, responsible, for, the, attribution, of, new, element, names, settled, the, dispute, in, 1909, by, granting, priority, to, urbain, and, adopting, his, names, as, official, ones, based, on, the, fact, that, the, separation, of, lutetium, from, marignac, s, ytterbium, was, first, described, by, urbain, after, urbain, s, names, were, recognized, neoytterbium, was, reverted, to, ytterbium, the, chemical, and, physical, properties, of, ytterbium, could, not, be, determined, with, any, precision, until, 1953, when, the, first, nearly, pure, ytterbium, metal, was, produced, by, using, ion, exchange, processes, the, price, of, ytterbium, was, relatively, stable, between, 1953, and, 1998, at, about, us, 1, 000, kg, the, 169, yb, isotope, with, a, half, life, of, 32, days, which, is, created, along, with, the, short, lived, 175, yb, isotope, half, life, 4, 2, days, by, neutron, activation, during, the, irradiation, of, ytterbium, in, nuclear, reactors, has, been, used, as, a, radiation, source, in, portable, x, ray, machines, like, x, rays, the, gamma, rays, emitted, by, the, source, pass, through, soft, tissues, of, the, body, but, are, blocked, by, bones, and, other, dense, materials, thus, small, 169, yb, samples, which, emit, gamma, rays, act, like, tiny, x, ray, machines, useful, for, radiography, of, small, objects, experiments, show, that, radiographs, taken, with, a, 169, yb, source, are, roughly, equivalent, to, those, taken, with, x, rays, having, energies, between, 250, and, 350, kev, 169, yb, is, also, used, in, nuclear, medicine, in, 2013, ytterbium, clocks, held, the, record, for, stability, with, ticks, stable, to, within, less, than, two, parts, in, 1, quintillion, 2, 10, 18, these, clocks, developed, at, the, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, nist, rely, on, about, 10, 000, ytterbium, atoms, laser, cooled, to, 10, microkelvin, 10, millionths, of, a, degree, above, absolute, zero, and, trapped, in, an, optical, lattice, a, series, of, pancake, shaped, wells, made, of, laser, light, another, laser, that, ticks, 518, trillion, times, per, second, 518, thz, provokes, a, transition, between, two, energy, levels, in, the, atoms, the, large, number, of, atoms, is, key, to, the, clocks, high, stability, visible, light, waves, oscillate, faster, than, microwaves, hence, optical, clocks, can, be, more, precise, than, caesium, atomic, clocks, the, physikalisch, technische, bundesanstalt, is, working, on, several, such, optical, clocks, the, model, with, one, single, ytterbium, ion, caught, in, an, ion, trap, is, highly, accurate, the, optical, clock, based, on, it, is, exact, to, 17, digits, after, the, decimal, point, a, pair, of, experimental, atomic, clocks, based, on, ytterbium, atoms, at, the, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, has, set, a, record, for, stability, nist, physicists, reported, in, the, august, 22, 2013, issue, of, science, express, that, the, ytterbium, clocks, ticks, are, stable, to, within, less, than, two, parts, in, 1, quintillion, 1, followed, by, 18, zeros, roughly, 10, times, better, than, the, previous, best, published, results, for, other, atomic, clocks, the, clocks, would, be, accurate, within, a, second, for, a, period, comparable, to, the, age, of, the, universe, ytterbium, can, also, be, used, as, a, dopant, to, help, improve, the, grain, refinement, strength, and, other, mechanical, properties, of, stainless, steel, some, ytterbium, alloys, have, rarely, been, used, in, dentistry, the, yb, 3, ion, is, used, as, a, doping, material, in, active, laser, media, specifically, in, solid, state, lasers, and, double, clad, fiber, lasers, ytterbium, lasers, are, highly, efficient, have, long, lifetimes, and, can, generate, short, pulses, ytterbium, can, also, easily, be, incorporated, into, the, material, used, to, make, the, laser, ytterbium, lasers, commonly, radiate, in, the, 1, 03, 1, 12, m, band, being, optically, pumped, at, wavelength, 900, nm, 1, m, dependently, on, the, host, and, application, the, small, quantum, defect, makes, ytterbium, a, prospective, dopant, for, efficient, lasers, and, power, scaling, the, kinetic, of, excitations, in, ytterbium, doped, materials, is, simple, and, can, be, described, within, the, concept, of, effective, cross, sections, for, most, ytterbium, doped, laser, materials, as, for, many, other, optically, pumped, gain, media, the, mccumber, relation, holds, although, the, application, to, the, ytterbium, doped, composite, materials, was, under, discussion, usually, low, concentrations, of, ytterbium, are, used, at, high, concentrations, the, ytterbium, doped, materials, show, photodarkening, glass, fibers, or, even, a, switch, to, broadband, emission, crystals, and, ceramics, instead, of, efficient, laser, action, this, effect, may, be, related, with, not, only, overheating, but, also, with, conditions, of, charge, compensation, at, high, concentrations, of, ytterbium, ions, much, progress, has, been, made, in, the, power, scaling, lasers, and, amplifiers, produced, with, ytterbium, yb, doped, optical, fibers, power, levels, have, increased, from, the, 1, kw, regimes, due, to, the, advancements, in, components, as, well, as, the, yb, doped, fibers, fabrication, of, low, na, large, mode, area, fibers, enable, achievement, of, near, perfect, beam, qualities, m2, 1, 1, at, power, levels, of, 1, 5, kw, to, greater, than, 2, kw, at, 1064, nm, in, a, broadband, configuration, ytterbium, doped, lma, fibers, also, have, the, advantages, of, a, larger, mode, field, diameter, which, negates, the, impacts, of, nonlinear, effects, such, as, stimulated, brillouin, scattering, and, stimulated, raman, scattering, which, limit, the, achievement, of, higher, power, levels, and, provide, a, distinct, advantage, over, single, mode, ytterbium, doped, fibers, to, achieve, even, higher, power, levels, in, ytterbium, based, fiber, systems, all, factors, of, the, fiber, must, be, considered, these, can, be, achieved, only, through, optimization, of, all, ytterbium, fiber, parameters, ranging, from, the, core, background, losses, to, the, geometrical, properties, to, reduce, the, splice, losses, within, the, cavity, power, scaling, also, requires, optimization, of, matching, passive, fibers, within, the, optical, cavity, the, optimization, of, the, ytterbium, doped, glass, itself, through, host, glass, modification, of, various, dopants, also, plays, a, large, part, in, reducing, the, background, loss, of, the, glass, improvements, in, slope, efficiency, of, the, fiber, and, improved, photodarkening, performance, all, of, which, contribute, to, increased, power, levels, in, 1, m, systems, the, charged, ion, 171, yb, is, used, by, multiple, academic, groups, and, companies, as, the, trapped, ion, qubit, for, quantum, computing, entangling, gates, such, as, the, m, lmer, s, rensen, gate, have, been, achieved, by, addressing, the, ions, with, mode, locked, pulse, lasers, ytterbium, metal, increases, its, electrical, resistivity, when, subjected, to, high, stresses, this, property, is, used, in, stress, gauges, to, monitor, ground, deformations, from, earthquakes, and, explosions, currently, ytterbium, is, being, investigated, as, a, possible, replacement, for, magnesium, in, high, density, pyrotechnic, payloads, for, kinematic, infrared, decoy, flares, as, ytterbium, iii, oxide, has, a, significantly, higher, emissivity, in, the, infrared, range, than, magnesium, oxide, a, higher, radiant, intensity, is, obtained, with, ytterbium, based, payloads, in, comparison, to, those, commonly, based, on, magnesium, teflon, viton, mtv, although, ytterbium, is, fairly, stable, chemically, it, is, stored, in, airtight, containers, and, in, an, inert, atmosphere, such, as, a, nitrogen, filled, dry, box, to, protect, it, from, air, and, moisture, all, compounds, of, ytterbium, are, treated, as, highly, toxic, although, studies, appear, to, indicate, that, the, danger, is, minimal, however, ytterbium, compounds, cause, irritation, to, human, skin, and, eyes, and, some, might, be, teratogenic, metallic, ytterbium, dust, can, spontaneously, combust
