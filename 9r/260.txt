a, protostar, is, a, very, young, star, that, is, still, gathering, mass, from, its, parent, molecular, cloud, it, is, the, earliest, phase, in, the, process, of, stellar, evolution, for, a, low, mass, star, i, e, that, of, the, sun, or, lower, it, lasts, about, 500, 000, years, the, phase, begins, when, a, molecular, cloud, fragment, first, collapses, under, the, force, of, self, gravity, and, an, opaque, pressure, supported, core, forms, inside, the, collapsing, fragment, it, ends, when, the, infalling, gas, is, depleted, leaving, a, pre, main, sequence, star, which, contracts, to, later, become, a, main, sequence, star, at, the, onset, of, hydrogen, fusion, producing, helium, the, modern, picture, of, protostars, summarized, above, was, first, suggested, by, chushiro, hayashi, in, 1966, in, the, first, models, the, size, of, protostars, was, greatly, overestimated, subsequent, numerical, calculations, clarified, the, issue, and, showed, that, protostars, are, only, modestly, larger, than, main, sequence, stars, of, the, same, mass, this, basic, theoretical, result, has, been, confirmed, by, observations, which, find, that, the, largest, pre, main, sequence, stars, are, also, of, modest, size, star, formation, begins, in, relatively, small, molecular, clouds, called, dense, cores, each, dense, core, is, initially, in, balance, between, self, gravity, which, tends, to, compress, the, object, and, both, gas, pressure, and, magnetic, pressure, which, tend, to, inflate, it, as, the, dense, core, accrues, mass, from, its, larger, surrounding, cloud, self, gravity, begins, to, overwhelm, pressure, and, collapse, begins, theoretical, modeling, of, an, idealized, spherical, cloud, initially, supported, only, by, gas, pressure, indicates, that, the, collapse, process, spreads, from, the, inside, toward, the, outside, spectroscopic, observations, of, dense, cores, that, do, not, yet, contain, stars, indicate, that, contraction, indeed, occurs, so, far, however, the, predicted, outward, spread, of, the, collapse, region, has, not, been, observed, the, gas, that, collapses, toward, the, center, of, the, dense, core, first, builds, up, a, low, mass, protostar, and, then, a, protoplanetary, disk, orbiting, the, object, as, the, collapse, continues, an, increasing, amount, of, gas, impacts, the, disk, rather, than, the, star, a, consequence, of, angular, momentum, conservation, exactly, how, material, in, the, disk, spirals, inward, onto, the, protostar, is, not, yet, understood, despite, a, great, deal, of, theoretical, effort, this, problem, is, illustrative, of, the, larger, issue, of, accretion, disk, theory, which, plays, a, role, in, much, of, astrophysics, regardless, of, the, details, the, outer, surface, of, a, protostar, consists, at, least, partially, of, shocked, gas, that, has, fallen, from, the, inner, edge, of, the, disk, the, surface, is, thus, very, different, from, the, relatively, quiescent, photosphere, of, a, pre, main, sequence, or, main, sequence, star, within, its, deep, interior, the, protostar, has, lower, temperature, than, an, ordinary, star, at, its, center, hydrogen, 1, is, not, yet, fusing, with, itself, theory, predicts, however, that, the, hydrogen, isotope, deuterium, hydrogen, 2, fuses, with, hydrogen, 1, creating, helium, 3, the, heat, from, this, fusion, reaction, tends, to, inflate, the, protostar, and, thereby, helps, determine, the, size, of, the, youngest, observed, pre, main, sequence, stars, the, energy, generated, from, ordinary, stars, comes, from, the, nuclear, fusion, occurring, at, their, centers, protostars, also, generate, energy, but, it, comes, from, the, radiation, liberated, at, the, shocks, on, its, surface, and, on, the, surface, of, its, surrounding, disk, the, radiation, thus, created, must, traverse, the, interstellar, dust, in, the, surrounding, dense, core, the, dust, absorbs, all, impinging, photons, and, reradiates, them, at, longer, wavelengths, consequently, a, protostar, is, not, detectable, at, optical, wavelengths, and, cannot, be, placed, in, the, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, unlike, the, more, evolved, pre, main, sequence, stars, the, actual, radiation, emanating, from, a, protostar, is, predicted, to, be, in, the, infrared, and, millimeter, regimes, point, like, sources, of, such, long, wavelength, radiation, are, commonly, seen, in, regions, that, are, obscured, by, molecular, clouds, it, is, commonly, believed, that, those, conventionally, labeled, as, class, 0, or, class, i, sources, are, protostars, however, there, is, still, no, definitive, evidence, for, this, identification
