chemical, kinetics, also, known, as, reaction, kinetics, is, the, branch, of, physical, chemistry, that, is, concerned, with, understanding, the, rates, of, chemical, reactions, it, is, different, from, chemical, thermodynamics, which, deals, with, the, direction, in, which, a, reaction, occurs, but, in, itself, tells, nothing, about, its, rate, chemical, kinetics, includes, investigations, of, how, experimental, conditions, influence, the, speed, of, a, chemical, reaction, and, yield, information, about, the, reaction, s, mechanism, and, transition, states, as, well, as, the, construction, of, mathematical, models, that, also, can, describe, the, characteristics, of, a, chemical, reaction, the, pioneering, work, of, chemical, kinetics, was, done, by, german, chemist, ludwig, wilhelmy, in, 1850, he, experimentally, studied, the, rate, of, inversion, of, sucrose, and, he, used, integrated, rate, law, for, the, determination, of, the, reaction, kinetics, of, this, reaction, his, work, was, noticed, 34, years, later, by, wilhelm, ostwald, after, wilhelmy, peter, waage, and, cato, guldberg, published, 1864, the, law, of, mass, action, which, states, that, the, speed, of, a, chemical, reaction, is, proportional, to, the, quantity, of, the, reacting, substances, van, t, hoff, studied, chemical, dynamics, and, in, 1884, published, his, famous, tudes, de, dynamique, chimique, in, 1901, he, was, awarded, by, the, first, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, in, recognition, of, the, extraordinary, services, he, has, rendered, by, the, discovery, of, the, laws, of, chemical, dynamics, and, osmotic, pressure, in, solutions, after, van, t, hoff, chemical, kinetics, deals, with, the, experimental, determination, of, reaction, rates, from, which, rate, laws, and, rate, constants, are, derived, relatively, simple, rate, laws, exist, for, zero, order, reactions, for, which, reaction, rates, are, independent, of, concentration, first, order, reactions, and, second, order, reactions, and, can, be, derived, for, others, elementary, reactions, follow, the, law, of, mass, action, but, the, rate, law, of, stepwise, reactions, has, to, be, derived, by, combining, the, rate, laws, of, the, various, elementary, steps, and, can, become, rather, complex, in, consecutive, reactions, the, rate, determining, step, often, determines, the, kinetics, in, consecutive, first, order, reactions, a, steady, state, approximation, can, simplify, the, rate, law, the, activation, energy, for, a, reaction, is, experimentally, determined, through, the, arrhenius, equation, and, the, eyring, equation, the, main, factors, that, influence, the, reaction, rate, include, the, physical, state, of, the, reactants, the, concentrations, of, the, reactants, the, temperature, at, which, the, reaction, occurs, and, whether, or, not, any, catalysts, are, present, in, the, reaction, gorban, and, yablonsky, have, suggested, that, the, history, of, chemical, dynamics, can, be, divided, into, three, eras, the, first, is, the, van, t, hoff, wave, searching, for, the, general, laws, of, chemical, reactions, and, relating, kinetics, to, thermodynamics, the, second, may, be, called, the, semenov, hinshelwood, wave, with, emphasis, on, reaction, mechanisms, especially, for, chain, reactions, the, third, is, associated, with, aris, and, the, detailed, mathematical, description, of, chemical, reaction, networks, the, reaction, rate, varies, depending, upon, what, substances, are, reacting, acid, base, reactions, the, formation, of, salts, and, ion, exchange, are, usually, fast, reactions, when, covalent, bond, formation, takes, place, between, the, molecules, and, when, large, molecules, are, formed, the, reactions, tend, to, be, slower, the, nature, and, strength, of, bonds, in, reactant, molecules, greatly, influence, the, rate, of, their, transformation, into, products, the, physical, state, solid, liquid, or, gas, of, a, reactant, is, also, an, important, factor, of, the, rate, of, change, when, reactants, are, in, the, same, phase, as, in, aqueous, solution, thermal, motion, brings, them, into, contact, however, when, they, are, in, separate, phases, the, reaction, is, limited, to, the, interface, between, the, reactants, reaction, can, occur, only, at, their, area, of, contact, in, the, case, of, a, liquid, and, a, gas, at, the, surface, of, the, liquid, vigorous, shaking, and, stirring, may, be, needed, to, bring, the, reaction, to, completion, this, means, that, the, more, finely, divided, a, solid, or, liquid, reactant, the, greater, its, surface, area, per, unit, volume, and, the, more, contact, it, with, the, other, reactant, thus, the, faster, the, reaction, to, make, an, analogy, for, example, when, one, starts, a, fire, one, uses, wood, chips, and, small, branches, one, does, not, start, with, large, logs, right, away, in, organic, chemistry, on, water, reactions, are, the, exception, to, the, rule, that, homogeneous, reactions, take, place, faster, than, heterogeneous, reactions, are, those, reactions, in, which, solute, and, solvent, not, mix, properly, in, a, solid, only, those, particles, that, are, at, the, surface, can, be, involved, in, a, reaction, crushing, a, solid, into, smaller, parts, means, that, more, particles, are, present, at, the, surface, and, the, frequency, of, collisions, between, these, and, reactant, particles, increases, and, so, reaction, occurs, more, rapidly, for, example, sherbet, powder, is, a, mixture, of, very, fine, powder, of, malic, acid, a, weak, organic, acid, and, sodium, hydrogen, carbonate, on, contact, with, the, saliva, in, the, mouth, these, chemicals, quickly, dissolve, and, react, releasing, carbon, dioxide, and, providing, for, the, fizzy, sensation, also, fireworks, manufacturers, modify, the, surface, area, of, solid, reactants, to, control, the, rate, at, which, the, fuels, in, fireworks, are, oxidised, using, this, to, create, diverse, effects, for, example, finely, divided, aluminium, confined, in, a, shell, explodes, violently, if, larger, pieces, of, aluminium, are, used, the, reaction, is, slower, and, sparks, are, seen, as, pieces, of, burning, metal, are, ejected, the, reactions, are, due, to, collisions, of, reactant, species, the, frequency, with, which, the, molecules, or, ions, collide, depends, upon, their, concentrations, the, more, crowded, the, molecules, are, the, more, likely, they, are, to, collide, and, react, with, one, another, thus, an, increase, in, the, concentrations, of, the, reactants, will, usually, result, in, the, corresponding, increase, in, the, reaction, rate, while, a, decrease, in, the, concentrations, will, usually, have, a, reverse, effect, for, example, combustion, will, occur, more, rapidly, in, pure, oxygen, than, in, air, 21, oxygen, the, rate, equation, shows, the, detailed, dependence, of, the, reaction, rate, on, the, concentrations, of, reactants, and, other, species, present, the, mathematical, forms, depend, on, the, reaction, mechanism, the, actual, rate, equation, for, a, given, reaction, is, determined, experimentally, and, provides, information, about, the, reaction, mechanism, the, mathematical, expression, of, the, rate, equation, is, often, given, by, here, k, displaystyle, k, is, the, reaction, rate, constant, c, i, displaystyle, c, i, is, the, molar, concentration, of, reactant, i, and, m, i, displaystyle, m, i, is, the, partial, order, of, reaction, for, this, reactant, the, partial, order, for, a, reactant, can, only, be, determined, experimentally, and, is, often, not, indicated, by, its, stoichiometric, coefficient, temperature, usually, has, a, major, effect, on, the, rate, of, a, chemical, reaction, molecules, at, a, higher, temperature, have, more, thermal, energy, although, collision, frequency, is, greater, at, higher, temperatures, this, alone, contributes, only, a, very, small, proportion, to, the, increase, in, rate, of, reaction, much, more, important, is, the, fact, that, the, proportion, of, reactant, molecules, with, sufficient, energy, to, react, energy, greater, than, activation, energy, e, e, a, is, significantly, higher, and, is, explained, in, detail, by, the, maxwell, boltzmann, distribution, of, molecular, energies, the, effect, of, temperature, on, the, reaction, rate, constant, usually, obeys, the, arrhenius, equation, k, a, e, e, a, r, t, displaystyle, k, ae, e, rm, a, rt, where, a, is, the, pre, exponential, factor, or, a, factor, e, a, is, the, activation, energy, r, is, the, molar, gas, constant, and, t, is, the, absolute, temperature, at, a, given, temperature, the, chemical, rate, of, a, reaction, depends, on, the, value, of, the, a, factor, the, magnitude, of, the, activation, energy, and, the, concentrations, of, the, reactants, usually, rapid, reactions, require, relatively, small, activation, energies, the, rule, of, thumb, that, the, rate, of, chemical, reactions, doubles, for, every, 10, c, temperature, rise, is, a, common, misconception, this, may, have, been, generalized, from, the, special, case, of, biological, systems, where, the, temperature, coefficient, is, often, between, 1, 5, and, 2, 5, the, kinetics, of, rapid, reactions, can, be, studied, with, the, temperature, jump, method, this, involves, using, a, sharp, rise, in, temperature, and, observing, the, relaxation, time, of, the, return, to, equilibrium, a, particularly, useful, form, of, temperature, jump, apparatus, is, a, shock, tube, which, can, rapidly, increase, a, gas, s, temperature, by, more, than, 1000, degrees, a, catalyst, is, a, substance, that, alters, the, rate, of, a, chemical, reaction, but, it, remains, chemically, unchanged, afterwards, the, catalyst, increases, the, rate, of, the, reaction, by, providing, a, new, reaction, mechanism, to, occur, with, in, a, lower, activation, energy, in, autocatalysis, a, reaction, product, is, itself, a, catalyst, for, that, reaction, leading, to, positive, feedback, proteins, that, act, as, catalysts, in, biochemical, reactions, are, called, enzymes, michaelis, menten, kinetics, describe, the, rate, of, enzyme, mediated, reactions, a, catalyst, does, not, affect, the, position, of, the, equilibrium, as, the, catalyst, speeds, up, the, backward, and, forward, reactions, equally, in, certain, organic, molecules, specific, substituents, can, have, an, influence, on, reaction, rate, in, neighbouring, group, participation, increasing, the, pressure, in, a, gaseous, reaction, will, increase, the, number, of, collisions, between, reactants, increasing, the, rate, of, reaction, this, is, because, the, activity, of, a, gas, is, directly, proportional, to, the, partial, pressure, of, the, gas, this, is, similar, to, the, effect, of, increasing, the, concentration, of, a, solution, in, addition, to, this, straightforward, mass, action, effect, the, rate, coefficients, themselves, can, change, due, to, pressure, the, rate, coefficients, and, products, of, many, high, temperature, gas, phase, reactions, change, if, an, inert, gas, is, added, to, the, mixture, variations, on, this, effect, are, called, fall, off, and, chemical, activation, these, phenomena, are, due, to, exothermic, or, endothermic, reactions, occurring, faster, than, heat, transfer, causing, the, reacting, molecules, to, have, non, thermal, energy, distributions, non, boltzmann, distribution, increasing, the, pressure, increases, the, heat, transfer, rate, between, the, reacting, molecules, and, the, rest, of, the, system, reducing, this, effect, condensed, phase, rate, coefficients, can, also, be, affected, by, pressure, although, rather, high, pressures, are, required, for, a, measurable, effect, because, ions, and, molecules, are, not, very, compressible, this, effect, is, often, studied, using, diamond, anvils, a, reaction, s, kinetics, can, also, be, studied, with, a, pressure, jump, approach, this, involves, making, fast, changes, in, pressure, and, observing, the, relaxation, time, of, the, return, to, equilibrium, the, activation, energy, for, a, chemical, reaction, can, be, provided, when, one, reactant, molecule, absorbs, light, of, suitable, wavelength, and, is, promoted, to, an, excited, state, the, study, of, reactions, initiated, by, light, is, photochemistry, one, prominent, example, being, photosynthesis, the, experimental, determination, of, reaction, rates, involves, measuring, how, the, concentrations, of, reactants, or, products, change, over, time, for, example, the, concentration, of, a, reactant, can, be, measured, by, spectrophotometry, at, a, wavelength, where, no, other, reactant, or, product, in, the, system, absorbs, light, for, reactions, which, take, at, least, several, minutes, it, is, possible, to, start, the, observations, after, the, reactants, have, been, mixed, at, the, temperature, of, interest, for, faster, reactions, the, time, required, to, mix, the, reactants, and, bring, them, to, a, specified, temperature, may, be, comparable, or, longer, than, the, half, life, of, the, reaction, special, methods, to, start, fast, reactions, without, slow, mixing, step, include, while, chemical, kinetics, is, concerned, with, the, rate, of, a, chemical, reaction, thermodynamics, determines, the, extent, to, which, reactions, occur, in, a, reversible, reaction, chemical, equilibrium, is, reached, when, the, rates, of, the, forward, and, reverse, reactions, are, equal, the, principle, of, dynamic, equilibrium, and, the, concentrations, of, the, reactants, and, products, no, longer, change, this, is, demonstrated, by, for, example, the, haber, bosch, process, for, combining, nitrogen, and, hydrogen, to, produce, ammonia, chemical, clock, reactions, such, as, the, belousov, zhabotinsky, reaction, demonstrate, that, component, concentrations, can, oscillate, for, a, long, time, before, finally, attaining, the, equilibrium, in, general, terms, the, free, energy, change, g, of, a, reaction, determines, whether, a, chemical, change, will, take, place, but, kinetics, describes, how, fast, the, reaction, is, a, reaction, can, be, very, exothermic, and, have, a, very, positive, entropy, change, but, will, not, happen, in, practice, if, the, reaction, is, too, slow, if, a, reactant, can, produce, two, products, the, thermodynamically, most, stable, one, will, form, in, general, except, in, special, circumstances, when, the, reaction, is, said, to, be, under, kinetic, reaction, control, the, curtin, hammett, principle, applies, when, determining, the, product, ratio, for, two, reactants, interconverting, rapidly, each, going, to, a, distinct, product, it, is, possible, to, make, predictions, about, reaction, rate, constants, for, a, reaction, from, free, energy, relationships, the, kinetic, isotope, effect, is, the, difference, in, the, rate, of, a, chemical, reaction, when, an, atom, in, one, of, the, reactants, is, replaced, by, one, of, its, isotopes, chemical, kinetics, provides, information, on, residence, time, and, heat, transfer, in, a, chemical, reactor, in, chemical, engineering, and, the, molar, mass, distribution, in, polymer, chemistry, it, is, also, provides, information, in, corrosion, engineering, the, mathematical, models, that, describe, chemical, reaction, kinetics, provide, chemists, and, chemical, engineers, with, tools, to, better, understand, and, describe, chemical, processes, such, as, food, decomposition, microorganism, growth, stratospheric, ozone, decomposition, and, the, chemistry, of, biological, systems, these, models, can, also, be, used, in, the, design, or, modification, of, chemical, reactors, to, optimize, product, yield, more, efficiently, separate, products, and, eliminate, environmentally, harmful, by, products, when, performing, catalytic, cracking, of, heavy, hydrocarbons, into, gasoline, and, light, gas, for, example, kinetic, models, can, be, used, to, find, the, temperature, and, pressure, at, which, the, highest, yield, of, heavy, hydrocarbons, into, gasoline, will, occur, chemical, kinetics, is, frequently, validated, and, explored, through, modeling, in, specialized, packages, as, a, function, of, ordinary, differential, equation, solving, ode, solving, and, curve, fitting, in, some, cases, equations, are, unsolvable, analytically, but, can, be, solved, using, numerical, methods, if, data, values, are, given, there, are, two, different, ways, to, do, this, by, either, using, software, programmes, or, mathematical, methods, such, as, the, euler, method, examples, of, software, for, chemical, kinetics, are, i, tenua, a, java, app, which, simulates, chemical, reactions, numerically, and, allows, comparison, of, the, simulation, to, real, data, ii, python, coding, for, calculations, and, estimates, and, iii, the, kintecus, software, compiler, to, model, regress, fit, and, optimize, reactions, numerical, integration, for, a, 1st, order, reaction, a, b, the, differential, equation, of, the, reactant, a, is, d, a, d, t, k, a, displaystyle, frac, d, ce, dt, k, ce, it, can, also, be, expressed, as, d, a, d, t, f, t, a, displaystyle, frac, d, ce, dt, f, t, ce, which, is, the, same, as, y, f, x, y, displaystyle, y, f, x, y, to, solve, the, differential, equations, with, euler, and, runge, kutta, methods, we, need, to, have, the, initial, values, at, any, point, y, f, x, y, displaystyle, y, f, x, y, is, the, same, as, y, d, y, d, x, displaystyle, y, frac, dy, dx, we, can, approximate, the, differentials, as, discrete, increases, y, d, y, d, x, y, x, y, x, x, y, x, x, displaystyle, y, frac, dy, dx, approx, frac, delta, y, delta, x, frac, y, x, delta, x, y, x, delta, x, it, can, be, shown, analytically, that, the, ordinate, at, that, moment, to, the, curve, through, x, 0, y, 0, is, given, by, the, third, order, runge, kutta, formula
