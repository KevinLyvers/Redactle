alpha, centauri, centauri, cen, or, alpha, cen, is, a, triple, star, system, in, the, southern, constellation, of, centaurus, it, consists, of, three, stars, rigil, kentaurus, centauri, a, toliman, centauri, b, and, proxima, centauri, centauri, c, proxima, centauri, is, the, closest, star, to, the, sun, at, 4, 2465, light, years, 1, 3020, pc, centauri, a, and, b, are, sun, like, stars, class, g, and, k, respectively, that, together, form, the, binary, star, system, centauri, ab, to, the, naked, eye, these, two, main, components, appear, to, be, a, single, star, with, an, apparent, magnitude, of, 0, 27, it, is, the, brightest, star, in, the, constellation, and, the, third, brightest, in, the, night, sky, outshone, by, only, sirius, and, canopus, centauri, a, rigil, kentaurus, has, 1, 1, times, the, mass, and, 1, 5, times, the, luminosity, of, the, sun, while, centauri, b, toliman, is, smaller, and, cooler, at, 0, 9, solar, mass, and, less, than, 0, 5, solar, luminosity, the, pair, orbit, around, a, common, centre, with, an, orbital, period, of, 79, years, their, elliptical, orbit, is, eccentric, so, that, the, distance, between, a, and, b, varies, from, 35, 6, astronomical, units, au, or, about, the, distance, between, pluto, and, the, sun, to, 11, 2, au, or, about, the, distance, between, saturn, and, the, sun, centauri, c, or, more, commonly, proxima, centauri, is, a, small, faint, red, dwarf, class, m, though, not, visible, to, the, naked, eye, proxima, centauri, is, the, closest, star, to, the, sun, at, a, distance, of, 4, 24, ly, 1, 30, pc, slightly, closer, than, centauri, ab, currently, the, distance, between, proxima, centauri, and, centauri, ab, is, about, 13, 000, au, 0, 21, ly, equivalent, to, about, 430, times, the, radius, of, neptune, s, orbit, proxima, centauri, has, two, confirmed, planets, proxima, b, or, centauri, cb, an, earth, sized, planet, in, the, habitable, zone, discovered, in, 2016, and, proxima, d, centauri, cd, a, candidate, sub, earth, which, orbits, very, closely, to, the, star, announced, in, 2022, the, existence, of, proxima, c, centauri, cc, a, mini, neptune, 1, 5, au, away, discovered, in, 2019, is, controversial, centauri, a, may, have, a, neptune, sized, planet, in, the, habitable, zone, though, it, is, not, yet, known, with, certainty, to, be, planetary, in, nature, and, could, be, an, artifact, of, the, discovery, mechanism, centauri, b, has, no, known, planets, planet, cen, bb, purportedly, discovered, in, 2012, was, later, disproven, and, no, other, planet, has, yet, been, confirmed, centauri, latinised, to, alpha, centauri, is, the, system, s, designation, given, by, j, bayer, in, 1603, it, belongs, to, the, constellation, centaurus, named, after, the, half, human, half, horse, creature, in, greek, mythology, hercules, accidentally, wounded, the, centaur, and, placed, him, in, the, sky, after, his, death, alpha, centauri, marks, the, right, front, hoof, of, the, centaur, the, common, name, rigil, kentaurus, is, a, latinisation, of, the, arabic, translation, rijl, al, qin, rus, meaning, the, foot, of, the, centaur, qin, rus, is, the, arabic, transliteration, of, the, greek, kentaurus, the, name, is, frequently, abbreviated, to, rigil, kent, or, even, rigil, though, the, latter, name, is, better, known, for, rigel, orionis, an, alternative, name, found, in, european, sources, toliman, is, an, approximation, of, the, arabic, a, al, m, n, in, older, transcription, a, hal, m, n, meaning, the, two, male, ostriches, an, appellation, zakariya, al, qazwini, had, applied, to, the, pair, of, stars, lambda, and, mu, sagittarii, it, was, often, not, clear, on, old, star, maps, which, name, was, intended, to, go, with, which, star, or, stars, and, the, referents, changed, over, time, a, third, name, that, has, been, used, is, bungula, b, ju, l, its, origin, is, not, known, but, it, may, have, been, coined, from, the, greek, letter, beta, and, latin, ungula, hoof, originally, for, beta, centauri, the, other, hoof, centauri, c, was, discovered, in, 1915, by, robert, t, a, innes, who, suggested, that, it, be, named, proxima, centaurus, from, latin, the, nearest, of, centaurus, the, name, proxima, centauri, later, became, more, widely, used, and, is, now, listed, by, the, international, astronomical, union, iau, as, the, approved, proper, name, commonly, it, is, frequently, abbreviated, to, proxima, in, 2016, the, working, group, on, star, names, of, the, iau, having, decided, to, attribute, proper, names, to, individual, component, stars, rather, than, to, multiple, systems, approved, the, name, rigil, kentaurus, r, a, d, l, k, n, t, r, s, as, being, restricted, to, centauri, a, and, the, name, proxima, centauri, p, r, k, s, m, s, n, t, r, a, for, centauri, c, on, 10, august, 2018, the, iau, approved, the, name, toliman, t, l, m, n, for, centauri, b, to, the, naked, eye, centauri, ab, appears, to, be, a, single, star, the, brightest, in, the, southern, constellation, of, centaurus, their, apparent, angular, separation, varies, over, about, 80, years, between, 2, and, 22, arcseconds, the, naked, eye, has, a, resolution, of, 60, arcsec, but, through, much, of, the, orbit, both, are, easily, resolved, in, binoculars, or, small, telescopes, at, 0, 27, apparent, magnitude, combined, for, a, and, b, magnitudes, see, apparent, magnitude, magnitude, addition, alpha, centauri, is, a, first, magnitude, star, and, is, fainter, only, than, sirius, and, canopus, it, is, the, outer, star, of, the, pointers, or, the, southern, pointers, so, called, because, the, line, through, beta, centauri, hadar, agena, some, 4, 5, west, points, to, the, constellation, crux, the, southern, cross, the, pointers, easily, distinguish, the, true, southern, cross, from, the, fainter, asterism, known, as, the, false, cross, south, of, about, 29, south, latitude, cen, is, circumpolar, and, never, sets, below, the, horizon, north, of, about, 29, n, latitude, alpha, centauri, never, rises, alpha, centauri, lies, close, to, the, southern, horizon, when, viewed, from, the, 29, north, latitude, to, the, equator, close, to, hermosillo, and, chihuahua, city, in, mexico, galveston, texas, ocala, florida, and, lanzarote, the, canary, islands, of, spain, but, only, for, a, short, time, around, its, culmination, the, star, culminates, each, year, at, local, midnight, on, 24, april, and, at, local, 9, p, m, on, 8, june, as, seen, from, earth, proxima, centauri, is, 2, 2, southwest, from, centauri, ab, this, distance, is, about, four, times, the, angular, diameter, of, the, moon, proxima, centauri, appears, as, a, deep, red, star, of, a, typical, apparent, magnitude, of, 11, 1, in, a, sparsely, populated, star, field, requiring, moderately, sized, telescopes, to, be, seen, listed, as, v645, cen, in, the, general, catalogue, of, variable, stars, version, 4, 2, this, uv, ceti, star, or, flare, star, can, unexpectedly, brighten, rapidly, by, as, much, as, 0, 6, magnitude, at, visual, wavelengths, then, fade, after, only, a, few, minutes, some, amateur, and, professional, astronomers, regularly, monitor, for, outbursts, using, either, optical, or, radio, telescopes, in, august, 2015, the, largest, recorded, flares, of, the, star, occurred, with, the, star, becoming, 8, 3, times, brighter, than, normal, on, 13, august, in, the, b, band, blue, light, region, alpha, centauri, may, be, inside, the, g, cloud, of, the, local, bubble, and, its, nearest, known, system, is, the, binary, brown, dwarf, system, luhman, 16, at, 3, 6, light, years, 1, 1, parsecs, from, alpha, centauri, alpha, centauri, is, listed, in, the, 2nd, century, the, star, catalog, appended, to, ptolemy, s, almagest, he, gave, its, ecliptic, coordinates, but, texts, differ, as, to, whether, the, ecliptic, latitude, reads, 44, 10, south, or, 41, 10, south, presently, the, ecliptic, latitude, is, 43, 5, south, but, it, has, decreased, by, a, fraction, of, a, degree, since, ptolemy, s, time, due, to, proper, motion, in, ptolemy, s, time, alpha, centauri, was, visible, from, alexandria, egypt, at, 31, n, but, due, to, precession, its, declination, is, now, 60, 51, south, and, it, can, no, longer, be, seen, at, that, latitude, english, explorer, robert, hues, brought, alpha, centauri, to, the, attention, of, european, observers, in, his, 1592, work, tractatus, de, globis, along, with, canopus, and, achernar, noting, now, therefore, there, are, but, three, stars, of, the, first, magnitude, that, i, could, perceive, in, all, those, parts, which, are, never, seene, here, in, england, the, first, of, these, is, that, bright, star, in, the, sterne, of, argo, which, they, call, canobus, the, second, is, in, the, end, of, eridanus, the, third, is, in, the, right, foote, of, the, centaure, the, binary, nature, of, alpha, centauri, ab, was, recognized, in, december, 1689, by, jean, richaud, while, observing, a, passing, comet, from, his, station, in, puducherry, alpha, centauri, was, only, the, third, binary, star, to, be, discovered, preceded, by, mizar, ab, and, acrux, the, large, proper, motion, of, alpha, centauri, ab, was, discovered, by, manuel, john, johnson, observing, from, saint, helena, who, informed, thomas, henderson, at, the, royal, observatory, cape, of, good, hope, of, it, the, parallax, of, alpha, centauri, was, subsequently, determined, by, henderson, from, many, exacting, positional, observations, of, the, ab, system, between, april, 1832, and, may, 1833, he, withheld, his, results, however, because, he, suspected, they, were, too, large, to, be, true, but, eventually, published, them, in, 1839, after, bessel, released, his, own, accurately, determined, parallax, for, 61, cygni, in, 1838, for, this, reason, alpha, centauri, is, sometimes, considered, as, the, second, star, to, have, its, distance, measured, because, henderson, s, work, was, not, fully, acknowledged, at, first, the, distance, of, alpha, centauri, from, the, earth, is, now, reckoned, at, 4, 396, light, years, or, 4, 159, 10, 13, km, later, john, herschel, made, the, first, micrometrical, observations, in, 1834, since, the, early, 20th, century, measures, have, been, made, with, photographic, plates, by, 1926, william, stephen, finsen, calculated, the, approximate, orbit, elements, close, to, those, now, accepted, for, this, system, all, future, positions, are, now, sufficiently, accurate, for, visual, observers, to, determine, the, relative, places, of, the, stars, from, a, binary, star, ephemeris, others, like, d, pourbaix, 2002, have, regularly, refined, the, precision, of, new, published, orbital, elements, robert, t, a, innes, discovered, proxima, centauri, in, 1915, by, blinking, photographic, plates, taken, at, different, times, during, a, proper, motion, survey, these, showed, large, proper, motion, and, parallax, similar, in, both, size, and, direction, to, those, of, centauri, ab, which, suggested, that, proxima, centauri, is, part, of, the, centauri, system, and, slightly, closer, to, earth, than, centauri, ab, as, such, innes, concluded, that, proxima, centauri, was, the, closest, star, to, earth, yet, discovered, all, components, of, centauri, display, significant, proper, motion, against, the, background, sky, over, centuries, this, causes, their, apparent, positions, to, slowly, change, proper, motion, was, unknown, to, ancient, astronomers, most, assumed, that, the, stars, were, permanently, fixed, on, the, celestial, sphere, as, stated, in, the, works, of, the, philosopher, aristotle, in, 1718, edmond, halley, found, that, some, stars, had, significantly, moved, from, their, ancient, astrometric, positions, in, the, 1830s, thomas, henderson, discovered, the, true, distance, to, centauri, by, analysing, his, many, astrometric, mural, circle, observations, he, then, realised, this, system, also, likely, had, a, high, proper, motion, in, this, case, the, apparent, stellar, motion, was, found, using, nicolas, louis, de, lacaille, s, astrometric, observations, of, 1751, 1752, by, the, observed, differences, between, the, two, measured, positions, in, different, epochs, calculated, proper, motion, of, the, centre, of, mass, for, centauri, ab, is, about, 3620, mas, y, milliarcseconds, per, year, toward, the, west, and, 694, mas, y, toward, the, north, giving, an, overall, motion, of, 3686, mas, y, in, a, direction, 11, north, of, west, the, motion, of, the, centre, of, mass, is, about, 6, 1, arcmin, each, century, or, 1, 02, each, millennium, the, speed, in, the, western, direction, is, 23, 0, km, s, 14, 3, mi, s, and, in, the, northerly, direction, 4, 4, km, s, 2, 7, mi, s, using, spectroscopy, the, mean, radial, velocity, has, been, determined, to, be, around, 22, 4, km, s, 13, 9, mi, s, towards, the, solar, system, this, gives, a, speed, with, respect, to, the, sun, of, 32, 4, km, s, 20, 1, mi, s, very, close, to, the, peak, in, the, distribution, of, speeds, of, nearby, stars, since, centauri, ab, is, almost, exactly, in, the, plane, of, the, milky, way, as, viewed, from, earth, many, stars, appear, behind, it, in, early, may, 2028, centauri, a, will, pass, between, the, earth, and, a, distant, red, star, when, there, is, a, 45, probability, that, an, einstein, ring, will, be, observed, other, conjunctions, will, also, occur, in, the, coming, decades, allowing, accurate, measurement, of, proper, motions, and, possibly, giving, information, on, planets, based, on, the, system, s, common, proper, motion, and, radial, velocities, centauri, will, continue, to, change, its, position, in, the, sky, significantly, and, will, gradually, brighten, for, example, in, about, 6, 200, ce, centauri, s, true, motion, will, cause, an, extremely, rare, first, magnitude, stellar, conjunction, with, beta, centauri, forming, a, brilliant, optical, double, star, in, the, southern, sky, it, will, then, pass, just, north, of, the, southern, cross, or, crux, before, moving, northwest, and, up, towards, the, present, celestial, equator, and, away, from, the, galactic, plane, by, about, 26, 700, ce, in, the, present, day, constellation, of, hydra, centauri, will, reach, perihelion, at, 0, 90, pc, or, 2, 9, ly, away, though, later, calculations, suggest, that, this, will, occur, in, 27, 000, ad, at, its, nearest, approach, centauri, will, attain, a, maximum, apparent, magnitude, of, 0, 86, comparable, to, present, day, magnitude, of, canopus, but, it, will, still, not, surpass, that, of, sirius, which, will, brighten, incrementally, over, the, next, 60, 000, years, and, will, continue, to, be, the, brightest, star, as, seen, from, earth, other, than, the, sun, for, the, next, 210, 000, years, alpha, centauri, is, a, triple, star, system, with, its, two, main, stars, a, and, b, together, comprising, a, binary, component, the, ab, designation, or, older, a, b, denotes, the, mass, centre, of, a, main, binary, system, relative, to, companion, star, s, in, a, multiple, star, system, ab, c, refers, to, the, component, of, proxima, centauri, in, relation, to, the, central, binary, being, the, distance, between, the, centre, of, mass, and, the, outlying, companion, because, the, distance, between, proxima, c, and, either, of, alpha, centauri, a, or, b, is, similar, the, ab, binary, system, is, sometimes, treated, as, a, single, gravitational, object, the, a, and, b, components, of, alpha, centauri, have, an, orbital, period, of, 79, 762, years, their, orbit, is, moderately, eccentric, as, it, has, an, eccentricity, of, almost, 0, 52, their, closest, approach, or, periastron, is, 11, 2, au, 1, 68, 10, 9, km, or, about, the, distance, between, the, sun, and, saturn, and, their, furthest, separation, or, apastron, is, 35, 6, au, 5, 33, 10, 9, km, about, the, distance, between, the, sun, and, pluto, the, most, recent, periastron, was, in, august, 1955, and, the, next, will, occur, in, may, 2035, the, most, recent, apastron, was, in, may, 1995, and, will, next, occur, in, 2075, viewed, from, earth, the, apparent, orbit, of, a, and, b, means, that, their, separation, and, position, angle, pa, are, in, continuous, change, throughout, their, projected, orbit, observed, stellar, positions, in, 2019, are, separated, by, 4, 92, arcsec, through, the, pa, of, 337, 1, increasing, to, 5, 49, arcsec, through, 345, 3, in, 2020, the, closest, recent, approach, was, in, february, 2016, at, 4, 0, arcsec, through, the, pa, of, 300, the, observed, maximum, separation, of, these, stars, is, about, 22, arcsec, while, the, minimum, distance, is, 1, 7, arcsec, the, widest, separation, occurred, during, february, 1976, and, the, next, will, be, in, january, 2056, alpha, centauri, c, is, about, 13, 000, au, 0, 21, ly, 1, 9, 10, 12, km, from, alpha, centauri, ab, equivalent, to, about, 5, of, the, distance, between, alpha, centauri, ab, and, the, sun, until, 2017, measurements, of, its, small, speed, and, its, trajectory, were, of, too, little, accuracy, and, duration, in, years, to, determine, whether, it, is, bound, to, alpha, centauri, ab, or, unrelated, radial, velocity, measurements, made, in, 2017, were, precise, enough, to, show, that, proxima, centauri, and, alpha, centauri, ab, are, gravitationally, bound, the, orbital, period, of, proxima, centauri, is, approximately, 511, 000, 41, 000, 30, 000, years, with, an, eccentricity, of, 0, 5, much, more, eccentric, than, mercury, s, proxima, centauri, comes, within, 4100, 700, 600, au, of, ab, at, periastron, and, its, apastron, occurs, at, 12, 300, 200, 100, au, asteroseismic, studies, chromospheric, activity, and, stellar, rotation, gyrochronology, are, all, consistent, with, the, alpha, centauri, system, being, similar, in, age, to, or, slightly, older, than, the, sun, asteroseismic, analyses, that, incorporate, tight, observational, constraints, on, the, stellar, parameters, for, the, alpha, centauri, stars, have, yielded, age, estimates, of, 4, 85, 0, 5, gyr, 5, 0, 0, 5, gyr, 5, 2, 1, 9, gyr, 6, 4, gyr, and, 6, 52, 0, 3, gyr, age, estimates, for, the, stars, based, on, chromospheric, activity, calcium, h, k, emission, yield, 4, 4, 2, 1, gyr, whereas, gyrochronology, yields, 5, 0, 0, 3, gyr, stellar, evolution, theory, implies, both, stars, are, slightly, older, than, the, sun, at, 5, to, 6, billion, years, as, derived, by, their, mass, and, spectral, characteristics, from, the, orbital, elements, the, total, mass, of, alpha, centauri, ab, is, about, 2, 0, m, or, twice, that, of, the, sun, the, average, individual, stellar, masses, are, about, 1, 08, m, and, 0, 91, m, respectively, though, slightly, different, masses, have, also, been, quoted, in, recent, years, such, as, 1, 14, m, and, 0, 92, m, totalling, 2, 06, m, alpha, centauri, a, and, b, have, absolute, magnitudes, of, 4, 38, and, 5, 71, respectively, alpha, centauri, a, also, known, as, rigil, kentaurus, is, the, principal, member, or, primary, of, the, binary, system, it, is, a, solar, like, main, sequence, star, with, a, similar, yellowish, colour, whose, stellar, classification, is, spectral, type, g2, v, it, is, about, 10, more, massive, than, the, sun, with, a, radius, about, 22, larger, when, considered, among, the, individual, brightest, stars, in, the, night, sky, it, is, the, fourth, brightest, at, an, apparent, magnitude, of, 0, 01, being, slightly, fainter, than, arcturus, at, an, apparent, magnitude, of, 0, 05, the, type, of, magnetic, activity, on, alpha, centauri, a, is, comparable, to, that, of, the, sun, showing, coronal, variability, due, to, star, spots, as, modulated, by, the, rotation, of, the, star, however, since, 2005, the, activity, level, has, fallen, into, a, deep, minimum, that, might, be, similar, to, the, sun, s, historical, maunder, minimum, alternatively, it, may, have, a, very, long, stellar, activity, cycle, and, is, slowly, recovering, from, a, minimum, phase, alpha, centauri, b, also, known, as, toliman, is, the, secondary, star, of, the, binary, system, it, is, a, main, sequence, star, of, spectral, type, k1, v, making, it, more, an, orange, colour, than, alpha, centauri, a, it, has, around, 90, of, the, mass, of, the, sun, and, a, 14, smaller, diameter, although, it, has, a, lower, luminosity, than, a, alpha, centauri, b, emits, more, energy, in, the, x, ray, band, its, light, curve, varies, on, a, short, time, scale, and, there, has, been, at, least, one, observed, flare, it, is, more, magnetically, active, than, alpha, centauri, a, showing, a, cycle, of, 8, 2, 0, 2, yr, compared, to, 11, years, for, the, sun, and, has, about, half, the, minimum, to, peak, variation, in, coronal, luminosity, of, the, sun, alpha, centauri, b, has, an, apparent, magnitude, of, 1, 35, slightly, dimmer, than, mimosa, alpha, centauri, c, better, known, as, proxima, centauri, is, a, small, main, sequence, red, dwarf, of, spectral, class, m6, ve, it, has, an, absolute, magnitude, of, 15, 60, over, 20, 000, times, fainter, than, the, sun, its, mass, is, calculated, to, be, 0, 1221, m, it, is, the, closest, star, to, the, sun, but, is, too, faint, to, be, visible, to, the, naked, eye, the, alpha, centauri, system, as, a, whole, has, two, confirmed, planets, both, of, them, around, proxima, centauri, while, other, planets, have, been, claimed, to, exist, around, all, of, the, stars, none, of, the, discoveries, have, been, confirmed, proxima, centauri, b, is, a, terrestrial, planet, discovered, in, 2016, by, astronomers, at, the, european, southern, observatory, eso, it, has, an, estimated, minimum, mass, of, 1, 17, m, e, earth, masses, and, orbits, approximately, 0, 049, au, from, proxima, centauri, placing, it, in, the, star, s, habitable, zone, the, discovery, of, proxima, centauri, c, was, formally, published, in, 2020, and, could, be, a, super, earth, or, mini, neptune, it, has, a, mass, of, roughly, 7, m, e, and, orbits, about, 1, 49, au, from, proxima, centauri, with, a, period, of, 1, 928, days, 5, 28, yr, in, june, 2020, a, possible, direct, imaging, detection, of, the, planet, hinted, at, the, presence, of, a, large, ring, system, however, a, 2022, study, disputed, the, existence, of, this, planet, a, 2020, paper, refining, proxima, b, s, mass, excludes, the, presence, of, extra, companions, with, masses, above, 0, 6, m, e, at, periods, shorter, than, 50, days, but, the, authors, detected, a, radial, velocity, curve, with, a, periodicity, of, 5, 15, days, suggesting, the, presence, of, a, planet, with, a, mass, of, about, 0, 29, m, e, this, planet, proxima, centauri, d, was, confirmed, in, 2022, in, 2021, a, candidate, planet, named, candidate, 1, abbreviated, as, c1, was, detected, around, alpha, centauri, a, thought, to, orbit, at, approximately, 1, 1, au, with, a, period, of, about, one, year, and, to, have, a, mass, between, that, of, neptune, and, one, half, that, of, saturn, though, it, may, be, a, dust, disk, or, an, artifact, the, possibility, of, c1, being, a, background, star, has, been, ruled, out, if, this, candidate, is, confirmed, the, temporary, name, c1, will, most, likely, be, replaced, with, the, scientific, designation, alpha, centauri, ab, in, accordance, with, current, naming, conventions, go, cycle, 1, observations, are, planned, for, the, james, webb, space, telescope, jwst, to, search, for, planets, around, alpha, centauri, a, as, well, as, observations, of, epsilon, muscae, the, coronographic, observations, which, occurred, on, july, 26, and, 27, 2023, were, failures, though, there, are, follow, up, observations, in, march, 2024, pre, launch, estimates, predicted, that, jwst, will, be, able, to, find, planets, with, a, radius, of, 5, r, at, 1, 3, au, multiple, observations, every, 3, 6, months, could, push, the, limit, down, to, 3, r, post, processing, techniques, could, push, the, limit, down, to, 0, 5, 0, 7, r, post, launch, estimates, based, on, observations, of, hip, 65426, b, find, that, jwst, will, be, able, to, find, planets, even, closer, to, alpha, centauri, a, and, could, find, a, 5, r, planet, at, 0, 5, 2, 5, au, candidate, 1, has, an, estimated, radius, between, 3, 3, 11, r, and, orbits, at, 1, 1, au, it, is, therefore, likely, within, the, reach, of, jwst, observations, the, first, claim, of, a, planet, around, alpha, centauri, b, was, that, of, alpha, centauri, bb, in, 2012, which, was, proposed, to, be, an, earth, mass, planet, in, a, 3, 2, day, orbit, this, was, refuted, in, 2015, when, the, apparent, planet, was, shown, to, be, an, artifact, of, the, way, the, radial, velocity, data, was, processed, a, search, for, transits, of, planet, bb, was, conducted, with, the, hubble, space, telescope, from, 2013, to, 2014, this, search, detected, one, potential, transit, like, event, which, could, be, associated, with, a, different, planet, with, a, radius, around, 0, 92, r, this, planet, would, most, likely, orbit, alpha, centauri, b, with, an, orbital, period, of, 20, 4, days, or, less, with, only, a, 5, chance, of, it, having, a, longer, orbit, the, median, of, the, likely, orbits, is, 12, 4, days, its, orbit, would, likely, have, an, eccentricity, of, 0, 24, or, less, it, could, have, lakes, of, molten, lava, and, would, be, far, too, close, to, alpha, centauri, b, to, harbour, life, if, confirmed, this, planet, might, be, called, alpha, centauri, bc, however, the, name, has, not, been, used, in, the, literature, as, it, is, not, a, claimed, discovery, additional, planets, may, exist, in, the, alpha, centauri, system, either, orbiting, alpha, centauri, a, or, alpha, centauri, b, individually, or, in, large, orbits, around, alpha, centauri, ab, because, both, stars, are, fairly, similar, to, the, sun, for, example, in, age, and, metallicity, astronomers, have, been, especially, interested, in, making, detailed, searches, for, planets, in, the, alpha, centauri, system, several, established, planet, hunting, teams, have, used, various, radial, velocity, or, star, transit, methods, in, their, searches, around, these, two, bright, stars, all, the, observational, studies, have, so, far, failed, to, find, evidence, for, brown, dwarfs, or, gas, giants, in, 2009, computer, simulations, showed, that, a, planet, might, have, been, able, to, form, near, the, inner, edge, of, alpha, centauri, b, s, habitable, zone, which, extends, from, 0, 5, 0, 9, au, from, the, star, certain, special, assumptions, such, as, considering, that, the, alpha, centauri, pair, may, have, initially, formed, with, a, wider, separation, and, later, moved, closer, to, each, other, as, might, be, possible, if, they, formed, in, a, dense, star, cluster, would, permit, an, accretion, friendly, environment, farther, from, the, star, bodies, around, alpha, centauri, a, would, be, able, to, orbit, at, slightly, farther, distances, due, to, its, stronger, gravity, in, addition, the, lack, of, any, brown, dwarfs, or, gas, giants, in, close, orbits, around, alpha, centauri, make, the, likelihood, of, terrestrial, planets, greater, than, otherwise, a, theoretical, study, indicates, that, a, radial, velocity, analysis, might, detect, a, hypothetical, planet, of, 1, 8, m, e, in, alpha, centauri, b, s, habitable, zone, radial, velocity, measurements, of, alpha, centauri, b, made, with, the, high, accuracy, radial, velocity, planet, searcher, spectrograph, were, sufficiently, sensitive, to, detect, a, 4, m, e, planet, within, the, habitable, zone, of, the, star, i, e, with, an, orbital, period, p, 200, days, but, no, planets, were, detected, current, estimates, place, the, probability, of, finding, an, earth, like, planet, around, alpha, centauri, at, roughly, 75, the, observational, thresholds, for, planet, detection, in, the, habitable, zones, by, the, radial, velocity, method, are, currently, 2017, estimated, to, be, about, 50, m, e, for, alpha, centauri, a, 8, m, e, for, alpha, centauri, b, and, 0, 5, m, e, for, proxima, centauri, early, computer, generated, models, of, planetary, formation, predicted, the, existence, of, terrestrial, planets, around, both, alpha, centauri, a, and, b, but, most, recent, numerical, investigations, have, shown, that, the, gravitational, pull, of, the, companion, star, renders, the, accretion, of, planets, difficult, despite, these, difficulties, given, the, similarities, to, the, sun, in, spectral, types, star, type, age, and, probable, stability, of, the, orbits, it, has, been, suggested, that, this, stellar, system, could, hold, one, of, the, best, possibilities, for, harbouring, extraterrestrial, life, on, a, potential, planet, in, the, solar, system, it, was, once, thought, that, jupiter, and, saturn, were, probably, crucial, in, perturbing, comets, into, the, inner, solar, system, providing, the, inner, planets, with, a, source, of, water, and, various, other, ices, however, since, isotope, measurements, of, the, deuterium, to, hydrogen, d, h, ratio, in, comets, halley, hyakutake, hale, bopp, 2002t7, and, tuttle, yield, values, approximately, twice, that, of, earth, s, oceanic, water, more, recent, models, and, research, predict, that, less, than, 10, of, earth, s, water, was, supplied, from, comets, in, the, centauri, system, proxima, centauri, may, have, influenced, the, planetary, disk, as, the, centauri, system, was, forming, enriching, the, area, around, alpha, centauri, with, volatile, materials, this, would, be, discounted, if, for, example, centauri, b, happened, to, have, gas, giants, orbiting, centauri, a, or, vice, versa, or, if, centauri, a, and, b, themselves, were, able, to, perturb, comets, into, each, other, s, inner, systems, as, jupiter, and, saturn, presumably, have, done, in, the, solar, system, such, icy, bodies, probably, also, reside, in, oort, clouds, of, other, planetary, systems, when, they, are, influenced, gravitationally, by, either, the, gas, giants, or, disruptions, by, passing, nearby, stars, many, of, these, icy, bodies, then, travel, star, wards, such, ideas, also, apply, to, the, close, approach, of, alpha, centauri, or, other, stars, to, the, solar, system, when, in, the, distant, future, the, oort, cloud, might, be, disrupted, enough, to, increase, the, number, of, active, comets, to, be, in, the, habitable, zone, a, planet, around, alpha, centauri, a, would, have, an, orbital, radius, of, between, about, 1, 2, and, 2, 1, au, so, as, to, have, similar, planetary, temperatures, and, conditions, for, liquid, water, to, exist, for, the, slightly, less, luminous, and, cooler, centauri, b, the, habitable, zone, is, between, about, 0, 7, and, 1, 2, au, with, the, goal, of, finding, evidence, of, such, planets, both, proxima, centauri, and, centauri, ab, were, among, the, listed, tier, 1, target, stars, for, nasa, s, space, interferometry, mission, s, i, m, detecting, planets, as, small, as, three, earth, masses, or, smaller, within, two, au, of, a, tier, 1, target, would, have, been, possible, with, this, new, instrument, the, s, i, m, mission, however, was, cancelled, due, to, financial, issues, in, 2010, based, on, observations, between, 2007, and, 2012, a, study, found, a, slight, excess, of, emissions, in, the, 24, m, mid, far, infrared, band, surrounding, centauri, ab, which, may, be, interpreted, as, evidence, for, a, sparse, circumstellar, disc, or, dense, interplanetary, dust, the, total, mass, was, estimated, to, be, between, 10, 7, to, 10, 6, the, mass, of, the, moon, or, 10, 100, times, the, mass, of, the, solar, system, s, zodiacal, cloud, if, such, a, disc, existed, around, both, stars, centauri, a, s, disc, would, likely, be, stable, to, 2, 8, au, and, centauri, b, s, would, likely, be, stable, to, 2, 5, au, this, would, put, a, s, disc, entirely, within, the, frost, line, and, a, small, part, of, b, s, outer, disc, just, outside, the, sky, from, centauri, ab, would, appear, much, as, it, does, from, the, earth, except, that, centaurus, s, brightest, star, being, centauri, ab, itself, would, be, absent, from, the, constellation, the, sun, would, appear, as, a, white, star, of, apparent, magnitude, 0, 5, roughly, the, same, as, the, average, brightness, of, betelgeuse, from, earth, it, would, be, at, the, antipodal, point, of, centauri, ab, s, current, right, ascension, and, declination, at, 02, h, 39, m, 36, s, 60, 50, 02, 308, 2000, in, eastern, cassiopeia, easily, outshining, all, the, rest, of, the, stars, in, the, constellation, with, the, placement, of, the, sun, east, of, the, magnitude, 3, 4, star, epsilon, cassiopeiae, nearly, in, front, of, the, heart, nebula, the, w, line, of, stars, of, cassiopeia, would, have, a, w, shape, the, winter, triangle, would, not, look, equilateral, but, very, thin, and, long, with, procyon, outshining, pollux, in, the, middle, of, gemini, and, sirius, lying, less, than, a, degree, from, betelgeuse, in, orion, with, a, magnitude, of, 1, 2, sirius, would, be, a, little, fainter, than, from, earth, but, still, the, brightest, star, in, the, night, sky, both, vega, and, altair, would, be, shifted, northwestward, relative, to, deneb, giving, the, summer, triangle, a, more, equilateral, appearance, a, planet, around, either, centauri, a, or, b, would, see, the, other, star, as, a, very, bright, secondary, for, example, an, earth, like, planet, at, 1, 25, au, from, cen, a, with, a, revolution, period, of, 1, 34, years, would, get, sun, like, illumination, from, its, primary, and, cen, b, would, appear, 5, 7, 8, 6, magnitudes, dimmer, 21, 0, to, 18, 2, 190, 2, 700, times, dimmer, than, cen, a, but, still, 150, 2, 100, times, brighter, than, the, full, moon, conversely, an, earth, like, planet, at, 0, 71, au, from, cen, b, with, a, revolution, period, of, 0, 63, years, would, get, nearly, sun, like, illumination, from, its, primary, and, cen, a, would, appear, 4, 6, 7, 3, magnitudes, dimmer, 22, 1, to, 19, 4, 70, to, 840, times, dimmer, than, cen, b, but, still, 470, 5, 700, times, brighter, than, the, full, moon, proxima, centauri, would, appear, dim, as, one, of, many, stars, in, modern, literature, colloquial, alternative, names, of, alpha, centauri, include, rigil, kent, also, rigel, kent, and, variants, r, a, d, l, k, n, t, and, toliman, the, latter, of, which, became, the, proper, name, of, alpha, centauri, b, on, 10, august, 2018, by, approval, of, the, international, astronomical, union, rigil, kent, is, short, for, rigil, kentaurus, which, is, sometimes, further, abbreviated, to, rigil, or, rigel, though, that, is, ambiguous, with, orionis, which, is, also, called, rigel, the, name, toliman,

the, latin, ungula, hoof, together, alpha, and, beta, centauri, form, the, southern, pointers, or, the, pointers, as, they, point, towards, the, southern, cross, the, asterism, of, the, constellation, of, crux, in, chinese, astronomy, n, n, m, n, meaning, southern, gate, refers, to, an, asterism, consisting, of, alpha, centauri, and, epsilon, centauri, consequently, the, chinese, name, for, alpha,

could, make, the, journey, to, alpha, centauri, in, 20, years, an, objective, of, such, a, mission, would, be, to, make, a, fly, by, of, and, possibly, photograph, planets, that, might, exist, in, the, system, the, existence, of, proxima, centauri, b, announced, by, the, european, southern, observatory, eso, in, august, 2016, would, be, a, target, for, the, starshot, program, nasa, released, a,
