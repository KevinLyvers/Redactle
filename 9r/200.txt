cosmic, voids, also, known, as, dark, space, are, vast, spaces, between, filaments, the, largest, scale, structures, in, the, universe, which, contain, very, few, or, no, galaxies, in, spite, of, their, size, most, galaxies, are, not, located, in, voids, this, is, because, most, galaxies, are, gravitationally, bound, together, creating, huge, cosmic, structures, known, as, galaxy, filaments, the, cosmological, evolution, of, the, void, regions, differs, drastically, from, the, evolution, of, the, universe, as, a, whole, there, is, a, long, stage, when, the, curvature, term, dominates, which, prevents, the, formation, of, galaxy, clusters, and, massive, galaxies, hence, although, even, the, emptiest, regions, of, voids, contain, more, than, 15, of, the, average, matter, density, of, the, universe, the, voids, look, almost, empty, to, an, observer, voids, typically, have, a, diameter, of, 10, to, 100, megaparsecs, 30, to, 300, million, light, years, particularly, large, voids, defined, by, the, absence, of, rich, superclusters, are, sometimes, called, supervoids, they, were, first, discovered, in, 1978, in, a, pioneering, study, by, stephen, gregory, and, laird, a, thompson, at, the, kitt, peak, national, observatory, voids, are, believed, to, have, been, formed, by, baryon, acoustic, oscillations, in, the, big, bang, collapses, of, mass, followed, by, implosions, of, the, compressed, baryonic, matter, starting, from, initially, small, anisotropies, from, quantum, fluctuations, in, the, early, universe, the, anisotropies, grew, larger, in, scale, over, time, regions, of, higher, density, collapsed, more, rapidly, under, gravity, eventually, resulting, in, the, large, scale, foam, like, structure, or, cosmic, web, of, voids, and, galaxy, filaments, seen, today, voids, located, in, high, density, environments, are, smaller, than, voids, situated, in, low, density, spaces, of, the, universe, voids, appear, to, correlate, with, the, observed, temperature, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, cmb, because, of, the, sachs, wolfe, effect, colder, regions, correlate, with, voids, and, hotter, regions, correlate, with, filaments, because, of, gravitational, redshifting, as, the, sachs, wolfe, effect, is, only, significant, if, the, universe, is, dominated, by, radiation, or, dark, energy, the, existence, of, voids, is, significant, in, providing, physical, evidence, for, dark, energy, the, structure, of, the, universe, can, be, broken, down, into, components, that, can, help, describe, the, characteristics, of, individual, regions, of, the, cosmos, these, are, the, main, structural, components, of, the, cosmic, web, voids, have, a, mean, density, less, than, a, tenth, of, the, average, density, of, the, universe, this, serves, as, a, working, definition, even, though, there, is, no, single, agreed, upon, definition, of, what, constitutes, a, void, the, matter, density, value, used, for, describing, the, cosmic, mean, density, is, usually, based, on, a, ratio, of, the, number, of, galaxies, per, unit, volume, rather, than, the, total, mass, of, the, matter, contained, in, a, unit, volume, study, of, cosmic, voids, within, the, discipline, of, astrophysics, began, in, the, mid, 1970s, when, redshift, surveys, led, two, separate, teams, of, astrophysicists, in, 1978, to, identify, superclusters, and, voids, in, the, distribution, of, galaxies, and, abell, clusters, the, new, redshift, surveys, revolutionized, the, field, of, astronomy, by, adding, depth, to, the, two, dimensional, maps, of, cosmological, structure, which, were, often, densely, packed, and, overlapping, allowing, for, the, first, three, dimensional, mapping, of, the, universe, through, redshift, surveys, their, depth, was, calculated, from, the, individual, redshifts, of, the, galaxies, due, to, the, expansion, of, the, universe, according, to, hubble, s, law, a, summarized, timeline, of, important, events, in, the, field, of, cosmic, voids, from, its, beginning, to, recent, times, is, as, follows, there, exist, a, number, of, ways, for, finding, voids, with, the, results, of, large, scale, surveys, of, the, universe, of, the, many, different, algorithms, virtually, all, fall, into, one, of, three, general, categories, the, first, class, consists, of, void, finders, that, try, to, find, empty, regions, of, space, based, on, local, galaxy, density, the, second, class, are, those, which, try, to, find, voids, via, the, geometrical, structures, in, the, dark, matter, distribution, as, suggested, by, the, galaxies, the, third, class, is, made, up, of, those, finders, which, identify, structures, dynamically, by, using, gravitationally, unstable, points, in, the, distribution, of, dark, matter, the, three, most, popular, methods, through, the, study, of, cosmic, voids, are, listed, below, this, first, class, method, uses, each, galaxy, in, a, catalog, as, its, target, and, then, uses, the, nearest, neighbor, approximation, to, calculate, the, cosmic, density, in, the, region, contained, in, a, spherical, radius, determined, by, the, distance, to, the, third, closest, galaxy, el, ad, piran, introduced, this, method, in, 1997, to, allow, a, quick, and, effective, method, for, standardizing, the, cataloging, of, voids, once, the, spherical, cells, are, mined, from, all, of, the, structure, data, each, cell, is, expanded, until, the, underdensity, returns, to, average, expected, wall, density, values, one, of, the, helpful, features, of, void, regions, is, that, their, boundaries, are, very, distinct, and, defined, with, a, cosmic, mean, density, that, starts, at, 10, in, the, body, and, quickly, rises, to, 20, at, the, edge, and, then, to, 100, in, the, walls, directly, outside, the, edges, the, remaining, walls, and, overlapping, void, regions, are, then, gridded, into, respectively, distinct, and, intertwining, zones, of, filaments, clusters, and, near, empty, voids, any, overlap, of, more, than, 10, with, already, known, voids, are, considered, to, be, subregions, within, those, known, voids, all, voids, admitted, to, the, catalog, had, a, minimum, radius, of, 10, mpc, in, order, to, ensure, all, identified, voids, were, not, accidentally, cataloged, due, to, sampling, errors, this, particular, second, class, algorithm, uses, a, voronoi, tessellation, technique, and, mock, border, particles, in, order, to, categorize, regions, based, on, a, high, density, contrasting, border, with, a, very, low, amount, of, bias, neyrinck, introduced, this, algorithm, in, 2008, with, the, purpose, of, introducing, a, method, that, did, not, contain, free, parameters, or, presumed, shape, tessellations, therefore, this, technique, can, create, more, accurately, shaped, and, sized, void, regions, although, this, algorithm, has, some, advantages, in, shape, and, size, it, has, been, criticized, often, for, sometimes, providing, loosely, defined, results, since, it, has, no, free, parameters, it, mostly, finds, small, and, trivial, voids, although, the, algorithm, places, a, statistical, significance, on, each, void, it, finds, a, physical, significance, parameter, can, be, applied, in, order, to, reduce, the, number, of, trivial, voids, by, including, a, minimum, density, to, average, density, ratio, of, at, least, 1, 5, subvoids, are, also, identified, using, this, process, which, raises, more, philosophical, questions, on, what, qualifies, as, a, void, void, finders, such, as, vide, are, based, on, zobov, this, third, class, method, is, drastically, different, from, the, previous, two, algorithms, listed, the, most, striking, aspect, is, that, it, requires, a, different, definition, of, what, it, means, to, be, a, void, instead, of, the, general, notion, that, a, void, is, a, region, of, space, with, a, low, cosmic, mean, density, a, hole, in, the, distribution, of, galaxies, it, defines, voids, to, be, regions, in, which, matter, is, escaping, which, corresponds, to, the, dark, energy, equation, of, state, w, void, centers, are, then, considered, to, be, the, maximal, source, of, the, displacement, field, denoted, as, s, the, purpose, for, this, change, in, definitions, was, presented, by, lavaux, and, wandelt, in, 2009, as, a, way, to, yield, cosmic, voids, such, that, exact, analytical, calculations, can, be, made, on, their, dynamical, and, geometrical, properties, this, allows, diva, to, heavily, explore, the, ellipticity, of, voids, and, how, they, evolve, in, the, large, scale, structure, subsequently, leading, to, the, classification, of, three, distinct, types, of, voids, these, three, morphological, classes, are, true, voids, pancake, voids, and, filament, voids, another, notable, quality, is, that, even, though, diva, also, contains, selection, function, bias, just, as, first, class, methods, do, diva, is, devised, such, that, this, bias, can, be, precisely, calibrated, leading, to, much, more, reliable, results, multiple, shortfalls, of, this, lagrangian, eulerian, hybrid, approach, exist, one, example, is, that, the, resulting, voids, from, this, method, are, intrinsically, different, than, those, found, by, other, methods, which, makes, an, all, data, points, inclusive, comparison, between, results, of, differing, algorithms, very, difficult, voids, have, contributed, significantly, to, the, modern, understanding, of, the, cosmos, with, applications, ranging, from, shedding, light, on, the, current, understanding, of, dark, energy, to, refining, and, constraining, cosmological, evolution, models, the, milky, way, galaxy, is, in, a, cosmic, void, named, the, kbc, void, some, popular, applications, are, mentioned, in, detail, below, the, simultaneous, existence, of, the, largest, known, voids, and, galaxy, clusters, requires, about, 70, dark, energy, in, the, universe, today, consistent, with, the, latest, data, from, the, cosmic, microwave, background, voids, act, as, bubbles, in, the, universe, that, are, sensitive, to, background, cosmological, changes, this, means, that, the, evolution, of, a, void, s, shape, is, in, part, the, result, of, the, expansion, of, the, universe, since, this, acceleration, is, believed, to, be, caused, by, dark, energy, studying, the, changes, of, a, void, s, shape, over, a, period, of, time, can, be, used, to, constrain, the, standard, cdm, model, or, further, refine, the, quintessence, cold, dark, matter, qcdm, model, and, provide, a, more, accurate, dark, energy, equation, of, state, additionally, the, abundance, of, voids, is, a, promising, way, to, constrain, the, dark, energy, equation, of, state, neutrinos, due, to, their, very, small, mass, and, extremely, weak, interaction, with, other, matter, will, free, stream, in, and, out, of, voids, which, are, smaller, than, the, mean, free, path, of, neutrinos, this, has, an, effect, on, the, size, and, depth, distribution, of, voids, and, is, expected, to, make, it, possible, with, future, astronomical, surveys, e, g, the, euclid, satellite, to, measure, the, sum, of, the, masses, of, all, neutrino, species, by, comparing, the, statistical, properties, of, void, samples, to, theoretical, predictions, cosmic, voids, contain, a, mix, of, galaxies, and, matter, that, is, slightly, different, than, other, regions, in, the, universe, this, unique, mix, supports, the, biased, galaxy, formation, picture, predicted, in, gaussian, adiabatic, cold, dark, matter, models, this, phenomenon, provides, an, opportunity, to, modify, the, morphology, density, correlation, that, holds, discrepancies, with, these, voids, such, observations, like, the, morphology, density, correlation, can, help, uncover, new, facets, about, how, galaxies, form, and, evolve, on, the, large, scale, on, a, more, local, scale, galaxies, that, reside, in, voids, have, differing, morphological, and, spectral, properties, than, those, that, are, located, in, the, walls, one, feature, that, has, been, found, is, that, voids, have, been, shown, to, contain, a, significantly, higher, fraction, of, starburst, galaxies, of, young, hot, stars, when, compared, to, samples, of, galaxies, in, walls, voids, offer, opportunities, to, study, the, strength, of, intergalactic, magnetic, fields, for, example, a, 2015, study, concluded, based, on, the, deflection, of, blazar, gamma, ray, emissions, that, travel, through, voids, that, intergalactic, space, contains, a, magnetic, field, of, strength, at, least, 10, 17, g, the, specific, large, scale, magnetic, structure, of, the, universe, suggests, primordial, magnetogenesis, which, in, turn, could, have, played, a, role, in, the, formation, of, magnetic, fields, within, galaxies, and, could, also, change, estimates, of, the, timeline, of, recombination, in, the, early, universe, cold, spots, in, the, cosmic, microwave, background, such, as, the, wmap, cold, spot, found, by, wilkinson, microwave, anisotropy, probe, could, possibly, be, explained, by, an, extremely, large, cosmic, void, that, has, a, radius, of, 120, mpc, as, long, as, the, late, integrated, sachs, wolfe, effect, was, accounted, for, in, the, possible, solution, anomalies, in, cmb, screenings, are, now, being, potentially, explained, through, the, existence, of, large, voids, located, down, the, line, of, sight, in, which, the, cold, spots, lie, although, dark, energy, is, currently, the, most, popular, explanation, for, the, acceleration, in, the, expansion, of, the, universe, another, theory, elaborates, on, the, possibility, of, our, galaxy, being, part, of, a, very, large, not, so, underdense, cosmic, void, according, to, this, theory, such, an, environment, could, naively, lead, to, the, demand, for, dark, energy, to, solve, the, problem, with, the, observed, acceleration, as, more, data, has, been, released, on, this, topic, the, chances, of, it, being, a, realistic, solution, in, place, of, the, current, cdm, interpretation, has, been, largely, diminished, but, not, all, together, abandoned, the, abundance, of, voids, particularly, when, combined, with, the, abundance, of, clusters, of, galaxies, is, a, promising, method, for, precision, tests, of, deviations, from, general, relativity, on, large, scales, and, in, low, density, regions, the, insides, of, voids, often, seem, to, adhere, to, cosmological, parameters, which, differ, from, those, of, the, known, universe, it, is, because, of, this, unique, feature, that, cosmic, voids, are, useful, laboratories, to, study, the, effects, that, gravitational, clustering, and, growth, rates, have, on, local, galaxies, and, structure, when, the, cosmological, parameters, have, different, values, from, the, outside, universe, due, to, the, observation, that, larger, voids, predominantly, remain, in, a, linear, regime, with, most, structures, within, exhibiting, spherical, symmetry, in, the, underdense, environment, that, is, the, underdensity, leads, to, near, negligible, particle, particle, gravitational, interactions, that, would, otherwise, occur, in, a, region, of, normal, galactic, density, testing, models, for, voids, can, be, performed, with, very, high, accuracy, the, cosmological, parameters, that, differ, in, these, voids, are, m, and, h, 0
