galaxy, groups, and, clusters, are, the, largest, known, gravitationally, bound, objects, to, have, arisen, thus, far, in, the, process, of, cosmic, structure, formation, they, form, the, densest, part, of, the, large, scale, structure, of, the, universe, in, models, for, the, gravitational, formation, of, structure, with, cold, dark, matter, the, smallest, structures, collapse, first, and, eventually, build, the, largest, structures, clusters, of, galaxies, clusters, are, then, formed, relatively, recently, between, 10, billion, years, ago, and, now, groups, and, clusters, may, contain, ten, to, thousands, of, individual, galaxies, the, clusters, themselves, are, often, associated, with, larger, non, gravitationally, bound, groups, called, superclusters, groups, of, galaxies, are, the, smallest, aggregates, of, galaxies, they, typically, contain, no, more, than, 50, galaxies, in, a, diameter, of, 1, to, 2, megaparsecs, mpc, see, 10, 22, m, for, distance, comparisons, their, mass, is, approximately, 10, 13, solar, masses, the, spread, of, velocities, for, the, individual, galaxies, is, about, 150, km, s, however, this, definition, should, be, used, as, a, guide, only, as, larger, and, more, massive, galaxy, systems, are, sometimes, classified, as, galaxy, groups, groups, are, the, most, common, structures, of, galaxies, in, the, universe, comprising, at, least, 50, of, the, galaxies, in, the, local, universe, groups, have, a, mass, range, between, those, of, the, very, large, elliptical, galaxies, and, clusters, of, galaxies, our, own, galaxy, the, milky, way, is, contained, in, the, local, group, of, more, than, 54, galaxies, in, july, 2017, s, paul, r, s, john, et, al, defined, clear, distinguishing, parameters, for, classifying, galaxy, aggregations, as, galaxy, groups, and, clusters, on, the, basis, of, scaling, laws, that, they, followed, according, to, this, paper, galaxy, aggregations, less, massive, than, 8, 10, 13, solar, masses, are, classified, as, galaxy, groups, clusters, are, larger, than, groups, although, there, is, no, sharp, dividing, line, between, the, two, when, observed, visually, clusters, appear, to, be, collections, of, galaxies, held, together, by, mutual, gravitational, attraction, however, their, velocities, are, too, large, for, them, to, remain, gravitationally, bound, by, their, mutual, attractions, implying, the, presence, of, either, an, additional, invisible, mass, component, or, an, additional, attractive, force, besides, gravity, x, ray, studies, have, revealed, the, presence, of, large, amounts, of, intergalactic, gas, known, as, the, intracluster, medium, this, gas, is, very, hot, between, 10, 7, k, and, 10, 8, k, and, hence, emits, x, rays, in, the, form, of, bremsstrahlung, and, atomic, line, emission, the, total, mass, of, the, gas, is, greater, than, that, of, the, galaxies, by, roughly, a, factor, of, two, however, this, is, still, not, enough, mass, to, keep, the, galaxies, in, the, cluster, since, this, gas, is, in, approximate, hydrostatic, equilibrium, with, the, overall, cluster, gravitational, field, the, total, mass, distribution, can, be, determined, it, turns, out, the, total, mass, deduced, from, this, measurement, is, approximately, six, times, larger, than, the, mass, of, the, galaxies, or, the, hot, gas, the, missing, component, is, known, as, dark, matter, and, its, nature, is, unknown, in, a, typical, cluster, perhaps, only, 5, of, the, total, mass, is, in, the, form, of, galaxies, maybe, 10, in, the, form, of, hot, x, ray, emitting, gas, and, the, remainder, is, dark, matter, brownstein, and, moffat, use, a, theory, of, modified, gravity, to, explain, x, ray, cluster, masses, without, dark, matter, observations, of, the, bullet, cluster, are, the, strongest, evidence, for, the, existence, of, dark, matter, however, brownstein, and, moffat, have, shown, that, their, modified, gravity, theory, can, also, account, for, the, properties, of, the, cluster, clusters, of, galaxies, have, been, found, in, surveys, by, a, number, of, observational, techniques, and, have, been, studied, in, detail, using, many, methods, clusters, of, galaxies, are, the, most, recent, and, most, massive, objects, to, have, arisen, in, the, hierarchical, structure, formation, of, the, universe, and, the, study, of, clusters, tells, one, about, the, way, galaxies, form, and, evolve, clusters, have, two, important, properties, their, masses, are, large, enough, to, retain, any, energetic, gas, ejected, from, member, galaxies, and, the, thermal, energy, of, the, gas, within, the, cluster, is, observable, within, the, x, ray, bandpass, the, observed, state, of, gas, within, a, cluster, is, determined, by, a, combination, of, shock, heating, during, accretion, radiative, cooling, and, thermal, feedback, triggered, by, that, cooling, the, density, temperature, and, substructure, of, the, intracluster, x, ray, gas, therefore, represents, the, entire, thermal, history, of, cluster, formation, to, better, understand, this, thermal, history, one, needs, to, study, the, entropy, of, the, gas, because, entropy, is, the, quantity, most, directly, changed, by, increasing, or, decreasing, the, thermal, energy, of, intracluster, gas
