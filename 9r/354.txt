fluorine, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, f, and, atomic, number, 9, it, is, the, lightest, halogen, and, exists, at, standard, conditions, as, pale, yellow, diatomic, gas, fluorine, is, extremely, reactive, as, it, reacts, with, all, other, elements, except, for, the, light, inert, gases, it, is, highly, toxic, among, the, elements, fluorine, ranks, 24th, in, cosmic, abundance, and, 13th, in, crustal, abundance, fluorite, the, primary, mineral, source, of, fluorine, which, gave, the, element, its, name, was, first, described, in, 1529, as, it, was, added, to, metal, ores, to, lower, their, melting, points, for, smelting, the, latin, verb, fluo, meaning, to, flow, gave, the, mineral, its, name, proposed, as, an, element, in, 1810, fluorine, proved, difficult, and, dangerous, to, separate, from, its, compounds, and, several, early, experimenters, died, or, sustained, injuries, from, their, attempts, only, in, 1886, did, french, chemist, henri, moissan, isolate, elemental, fluorine, using, low, temperature, electrolysis, a, process, still, employed, for, modern, production, industrial, production, of, fluorine, gas, for, uranium, enrichment, its, largest, application, began, during, the, manhattan, project, in, world, war, ii, owing, to, the, expense, of, refining, pure, fluorine, most, commercial, applications, use, fluorine, compounds, with, about, half, of, mined, fluorite, used, in, steelmaking, the, rest, of, the, fluorite, is, converted, into, hydrogen, fluoride, en, route, to, various, organic, fluorides, or, into, cryolite, which, plays, a, key, role, in, aluminium, refining, the, carbon, fluorine, bond, is, usually, very, stable, organofluorine, compounds, are, widely, used, as, refrigerants, electrical, insulation, and, ptfe, teflon, pharmaceuticals, such, as, atorvastatin, and, fluoxetine, contain, c, f, bonds, the, fluoride, ion, from, dissolved, fluoride, salts, inhibits, dental, cavities, and, so, finds, use, in, toothpaste, and, water, fluoridation, global, fluorochemical, sales, amount, to, more, than, us, 15, billion, a, year, fluorocarbon, gases, are, generally, greenhouse, gases, with, global, warming, potentials, 100, to, 23, 500, times, that, of, carbon, dioxide, and, sf, 6, has, the, highest, global, warming, potential, of, any, known, substance, organofluorine, compounds, often, persist, in, the, environment, due, to, the, strength, of, the, carbon, fluorine, bond, fluorine, has, no, known, metabolic, role, in, mammals, a, few, plants, and, marine, sponges, synthesize, organofluorine, poisons, most, often, monofluoroacetates, that, help, deter, predation, fluorine, atoms, have, nine, electrons, one, fewer, than, neon, and, electron, configuration, 1s, 2, 2s, 2, 2p, 5, two, electrons, in, a, filled, inner, shell, and, seven, in, an, outer, shell, requiring, one, more, to, be, filled, the, outer, electrons, are, ineffective, at, nuclear, shielding, and, experience, a, high, effective, nuclear, charge, of, 9, 2, 7, this, affects, the, atom, s, physical, properties, fluorine, s, first, ionization, energy, is, third, highest, among, all, elements, behind, helium, and, neon, which, complicates, the, removal, of, electrons, from, neutral, fluorine, atoms, it, also, has, a, high, electron, affinity, second, only, to, chlorine, and, tends, to, capture, an, electron, to, become, isoelectronic, with, the, noble, gas, neon, it, has, the, highest, electronegativity, of, any, reactive, element, fluorine, atoms, have, a, small, covalent, radius, of, around, 60, picometers, similar, to, those, of, its, period, neighbors, oxygen, and, neon, the, bond, energy, of, difluorine, is, much, lower, than, that, of, either, cl, 2, or, br, 2, and, similar, to, the, easily, cleaved, peroxide, bond, this, along, with, high, electronegativity, accounts, for, fluorine, s, easy, dissociation, high, reactivity, and, strong, bonds, to, non, fluorine, atoms, conversely, bonds, to, other, atoms, are, very, strong, because, of, fluorine, s, high, electronegativity, unreactive, substances, like, powdered, steel, glass, fragments, and, asbestos, fibers, react, quickly, with, cold, fluorine, gas, wood, and, water, spontaneously, combust, under, a, fluorine, jet, reactions, of, elemental, fluorine, with, metals, require, varying, conditions, alkali, metals, cause, explosions, and, alkaline, earth, metals, display, vigorous, activity, in, bulk, to, prevent, passivation, from, the, formation, of, metal, fluoride, layers, most, other, metals, such, as, aluminium, and, iron, must, be, powdered, and, noble, metals, require, pure, fluorine, gas, at, 300, 450, c, 572, 842, f, some, solid, nonmetals, sulfur, phosphorus, react, vigorously, in, liquid, fluorine, hydrogen, sulfide, and, sulfur, dioxide, combine, readily, with, fluorine, the, latter, sometimes, explosively, sulfuric, acid, exhibits, much, less, activity, requiring, elevated, temperatures, hydrogen, like, some, of, the, alkali, metals, reacts, explosively, with, fluorine, carbon, as, lamp, black, reacts, at, room, temperature, to, yield, tetrafluoromethane, graphite, combines, with, fluorine, above, 400, c, 752, f, to, produce, non, stoichiometric, carbon, monofluoride, higher, temperatures, generate, gaseous, fluorocarbons, sometimes, with, explosions, carbon, dioxide, and, carbon, monoxide, react, at, or, just, above, room, temperature, whereas, paraffins, and, other, organic, chemicals, generate, strong, reactions, even, completely, substituted, haloalkanes, such, as, carbon, tetrachloride, normally, incombustible, may, explode, although, nitrogen, trifluoride, is, stable, nitrogen, requires, an, electric, discharge, at, elevated, temperatures, for, reaction, with, fluorine, to, occur, due, to, the, very, strong, triple, bond, in, elemental, nitrogen, ammonia, may, react, explosively, oxygen, does, not, combine, with, fluorine, under, ambient, conditions, but, can, be, made, to, react, using, electric, discharge, at, low, temperatures, and, pressures, the, products, tend, to, disintegrate, into, their, constituent, elements, when, heated, heavier, halogens, react, readily, with, fluorine, as, does, the, noble, gas, radon, of, the, other, noble, gases, only, xenon, and, krypton, react, and, only, under, special, conditions, argon, does, not, react, with, fluorine, gas, however, it, does, form, a, compound, with, fluorine, argon, fluorohydride, at, room, temperature, fluorine, is, a, gas, of, diatomic, molecules, pale, yellow, when, pure, sometimes, described, as, yellow, green, it, has, a, characteristic, halogen, like, pungent, and, biting, odor, detectable, at, 20, ppb, fluorine, condenses, into, a, bright, yellow, liquid, at, 188, c, 306, 4, f, a, transition, temperature, similar, to, those, of, oxygen, and, nitrogen, fluorine, has, two, solid, forms, and, fluorine, the, latter, crystallizes, at, 220, c, 364, 0, f, and, is, transparent, and, soft, with, the, same, disordered, cubic, structure, of, freshly, crystallized, solid, oxygen, unlike, the, orthorhombic, systems, of, other, solid, halogens, further, cooling, to, 228, c, 378, 4, f, induces, a, phase, transition, into, opaque, and, hard, fluorine, which, has, a, monoclinic, structure, with, dense, angled, layers, of, molecules, the, transition, from, to, fluorine, is, more, exothermic, than, the, condensation, of, fluorine, and, can, be, violent, only, one, isotope, of, fluorine, occurs, naturally, in, abundance, the, stable, isotope, 19, f, it, has, a, high, magnetogyric, ratio, and, exceptional, sensitivity, to, magnetic, fields, because, it, is, also, the, only, stable, isotope, it, is, used, in, magnetic, resonance, imaging, eighteen, radioisotopes, with, mass, numbers, 13, 31, have, been, synthesized, of, which, 18, f, is, the, most, stable, with, a, half, life, of, 109, 734, minutes, 18, f, is, a, natural, trace, radioisotope, produced, by, cosmic, ray, spallation, of, atmospheric, argon, as, well, as, by, reaction, of, protons, with, natural, oxygen, 18, o, p, 18, f, n, other, radioisotopes, have, half, lives, less, than, 70, seconds, most, decay, in, less, than, half, a, second, the, isotopes, 17, f, and, 18, f, undergo, decay, and, electron, capture, lighter, isotopes, decay, by, proton, emission, and, those, heavier, than, 19, f, undergo, decay, the, heaviest, ones, with, delayed, neutron, emission, two, metastable, isomers, of, fluorine, are, known, 18m, f, with, a, half, life, of, 162, 7, nanoseconds, and, 26m, f, with, a, half, life, of, 2, 2, 1, milliseconds, among, the, lighter, elements, fluorine, s, abundance, value, of, 400, ppb, parts, per, billion, 24th, among, elements, in, the, universe, is, exceptionally, low, other, elements, from, carbon, to, magnesium, are, twenty, or, more, times, as, common, this, is, because, stellar, nucleosynthesis, processes, bypass, fluorine, and, any, fluorine, atoms, otherwise, created, have, high, nuclear, cross, sections, allowing, collisions, with, hydrogen, or, helium, to, generate, oxygen, or, neon, respectively, beyond, this, transient, existence, three, explanations, have, been, proposed, for, the, presence, of, fluorine, fluorine, is, the, thirteenth, most, common, element, in, earth, s, crust, at, 600, 700, ppm, parts, per, million, by, mass, though, believed, not, to, occur, naturally, elemental, fluorine, has, been, shown, to, be, present, as, an, occlusion, in, antozonite, a, variant, of, fluorite, most, fluorine, exists, as, fluoride, containing, minerals, fluorite, fluorapatite, and, cryolite, are, the, most, industrially, significant, fluorite, caf, 2, also, known, as, fluorspar, abundant, worldwide, is, the, main, source, of, fluoride, and, hence, fluorine, china, and, mexico, are, the, major, suppliers, fluorapatite, ca, 5, po, 4, 3, f, which, contains, most, of, the, world, s, fluoride, is, an, inadvertent, source, of, fluoride, as, a, byproduct, of, fertilizer, production, cryolite, na, 3, alf, 6, used, in, the, production, of, aluminium, is, the, most, fluorine, rich, mineral, economically, viable, natural, sources, of, cryolite, have, been, exhausted, and, most, is, now, synthesised, commercially, other, minerals, such, as, topaz, contain, fluorine, fluorides, unlike, other, halides, are, insoluble, and, do, not, occur, in, commercially, favorable, concentrations, in, saline, waters, trace, quantities, of, organofluorines, of, uncertain, origin, have, been, detected, in, volcanic, eruptions, and, geothermal, springs, the, existence, of, gaseous, fluorine, in, crystals, suggested, by, the, smell, of, crushed, antozonite, is, contentious, a, 2012, study, reported, the, presence, of, 0, 04, f, 2, by, weight, in, antozonite, attributing, these, inclusions, to, radiation, from, the, presence, of, tiny, amounts, of, uranium, in, 1529, georgius, agricola, described, fluorite, as, an, additive, used, to, lower, the, melting, point, of, metals, during, smelting, he, penned, the, latin, word, fluor, s, fluor, flow, for, fluorite, rocks, the, name, later, evolved, into, fluorspar, still, commonly, used, and, then, fluorite, the, composition, of, fluorite, was, later, determined, to, be, calcium, difluoride, hydrofluoric, acid, was, used, in, glass, etching, from, 1720, onward, andreas, sigismund, marggraf, first, characterized, it, in, 1764, when, he, heated, fluorite, with, sulfuric, acid, and, the, resulting, solution, corroded, its, glass, container, swedish, chemist, carl, wilhelm, scheele, repeated, the, experiment, in, 1771, and, named, the, acidic, product, fluss, spats, syran, fluorspar, acid, in, 1810, the, french, physicist, andr, marie, amp, re, suggested, that, hydrogen, and, an, element, analogous, to, chlorine, constituted, hydrofluoric, acid, he, also, proposed, in, a, letter, to, sir, humphry, davy, dated, august, 26, 1812, that, this, then, unknown, substance, may, be, named, fluorine, from, fluoric, acid, and, the, ine, suffix, of, other, halogens, this, word, often, with, modifications, is, used, in, most, european, languages, however, greek, russian, and, some, others, following, amp, re, s, later, suggestion, use, the, name, ftor, or, derivatives, from, the, greek, phthorios, destructive, the, new, latin, name, fluorum, gave, the, element, its, current, symbol, f, fl, was, used, in, early, papers, initial, studies, on, fluorine, were, so, dangerous, that, several, 19th, century, experimenters, were, deemed, fluorine, martyrs, after, misfortunes, with, hydrofluoric, acid, isolation, of, elemental, fluorine, was, hindered, by, the, extreme, corrosiveness, of, both, elemental, fluorine, itself, and, hydrogen, fluoride, as, well, as, the, lack, of, a, simple, and, suitable, electrolyte, edmond, fr, my, postulated, that, electrolysis, of, pure, hydrogen, fluoride, to, generate, fluorine, was, feasible, and, devised, a, method, to, produce, anhydrous, samples, from, acidified, potassium, bifluoride, instead, he, discovered, that, the, resulting, dry, hydrogen, fluoride, did, not, conduct, electricity, fr, my, s, former, student, henri, moissan, persevered, and, after, much, trial, and, error, found, that, a, mixture, of, potassium, bifluoride, and, dry, hydrogen, fluoride, was, a, conductor, enabling, electrolysis, to, prevent, rapid, corrosion, of, the, platinum, in, his, electrochemical, cells, he, cooled, the, reaction, to, extremely, low, temperatures, in, a, special, bath, and, forged, cells, from, a, more, resistant, mixture, of, platinum, and, iridium, and, used, fluorite, stoppers, in, 1886, after, 74, years, of, effort, by, many, chemists, moissan, isolated, elemental, fluorine, in, 1906, two, months, before, his, death, moissan, received, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, with, the, following, citation, n, recognition, of, the, great, services, rendered, by, him, in, his, investigation, and, isolation, of, the, element, fluorine, the, whole, world, has, admired, the, great, experimental, skill, with, which, you, have, studied, that, savage, beast, among, the, elements, the, frigidaire, division, of, general, motors, gm, experimented, with, chlorofluorocarbon, refrigerants, in, the, late, 1920s, and, kinetic, chemicals, was, formed, as, a, joint, venture, between, gm, and, dupont, in, 1930, hoping, to, market, freon, 12, ccl, 2, f, 2, as, one, such, refrigerant, it, replaced, earlier, and, more, toxic, compounds, increased, demand, for, kitchen, refrigerators, and, became, profitable, by, 1949, dupont, had, bought, out, kinetic, and, marketed, several, other, freon, compounds, polytetrafluoroethylene, teflon, was, serendipitously, discovered, in, 1938, by, roy, j, plunkett, while, working, on, refrigerants, at, kinetic, and, its, superlative, chemical, and, thermal, resistance, lent, it, to, accelerated, commercialization, and, mass, production, by, 1941, large, scale, production, of, elemental, fluorine, began, during, world, war, ii, germany, used, high, temperature, electrolysis, to, make, tons, of, the, planned, incendiary, chlorine, trifluoride, and, the, manhattan, project, used, huge, quantities, to, produce, uranium, hexafluoride, for, uranium, enrichment, since, uf, 6, is, as, corrosive, as, fluorine, gaseous, diffusion, plants, required, special, materials, nickel, for, membranes, fluoropolymers, for, seals, and, liquid, fluorocarbons, as, coolants, and, lubricants, this, burgeoning, nuclear, industry, later, drove, post, war, fluorochemical, development, fluorine, has, a, rich, chemistry, encompassing, organic, and, inorganic, domains, it, combines, with, metals, nonmetals, metalloids, and, most, noble, gases, and, almost, exclusively, assumes, an, oxidation, state, of, 1, fluorine, s, high, electron, affinity, results, in, a, preference, for, ionic, bonding, when, it, forms, covalent, bonds, these, are, polar, and, almost, always, single, alkali, metals, form, ionic, and, highly, soluble, monofluorides, these, have, the, cubic, arrangement, of, sodium, chloride, and, analogous, chlorides, alkaline, earth, difluorides, possess, strong, ionic, bonds, but, are, insoluble, in, water, with, the, exception, of, beryllium, difluoride, which, also, exhibits, some, covalent, character, and, has, a, quartz, like, structure, rare, earth, elements, and, many, other, metals, form, mostly, ionic, trifluorides, covalent, bonding, first, comes, to, prominence, in, the, tetrafluorides, those, of, zirconium, hafnium, and, several, actinides, are, ionic, with, high, melting, points, while, those, of, titanium, vanadium, and, niobium, are, polymeric, melting, or, decomposing, at, no, more, than, 350, c, 662, f, pentafluorides, continue, this, trend, with, their, linear, polymers, and, oligomeric, complexes, thirteen, metal, hexafluorides, are, known, all, octahedral, and, are, mostly, volatile, solids, but, for, liquid, mof, 6, and, ref, 6, and, gaseous, wf, 6, rhenium, heptafluoride, the, only, characterized, metal, heptafluoride, is, a, low, melting, molecular, solid, with, pentagonal, bipyramidal, molecular, geometry, metal, fluorides, with, more, fluorine, atoms, are, particularly, reactive, hydrogen, and, fluorine, combine, to, yield, hydrogen, fluoride, in, which, discrete, molecules, form, clusters, by, hydrogen, bonding, resembling, water, more, than, hydrogen, chloride, it, boils, at, a, much, higher, temperature, than, heavier, hydrogen, halides, and, unlike, them, is, miscible, with, water, hydrogen, fluoride, readily, hydrates, on, contact, with, water, to, form, aqueous, hydrogen, fluoride, also, known, as, hydrofluoric, acid, unlike, the, other, hydrohalic, acids, which, are, strong, hydrofluoric, acid, is, a, weak, acid, at, low, concentrations, however, it, can, attack, glass, something, the, other, acids, cannot, do, binary, fluorides, of, metalloids, and, p, block, nonmetals, are, generally, covalent, and, volatile, with, varying, reactivities, period, 3, and, heavier, nonmetals, can, form, hypervalent, fluorides, boron, trifluoride, is, planar, and, possesses, an, incomplete, octet, it, functions, as, a, lewis, acid, and, combines, with, lewis, bases, like, ammonia, to, form, adducts, carbon, tetrafluoride, is, tetrahedral, and, inert, its, group, analogues, silicon, and, germanium, tetrafluoride, are, also, tetrahedral, but, behave, as, lewis, acids, the, pnictogens, form, trifluorides, that, increase, in, reactivity, and, basicity, with, higher, molecular, weight, although, nitrogen, trifluoride, resists, hydrolysis, and, is, not, basic, the, pentafluorides, of, phosphorus, arsenic, and, antimony, are, more, reactive, than, their, respective, trifluorides, with, antimony, pentafluoride, the, strongest, neutral, lewis, acid, known, only, behind, gold, pentafluoride, chalcogens, have, diverse, fluorides, unstable, difluorides, have, been, reported, for, oxygen, the, only, known, compound, with, oxygen, in, an, oxidation, state, of, 2, sulfur, and, selenium, tetrafluorides, and, hexafluorides, exist, for, sulfur, selenium, and, tellurium, the, latter, are, stabilized, by, more, fluorine, atoms, and, lighter, central, atoms, so, sulfur, hexafluoride, is, especially, inert, chlorine, bromine, and, iodine, can, each, form, mono, tri, and, pentafluorides, but, only, iodine, heptafluoride, has, been, characterized, among, possible, interhalogen, heptafluorides, many, of, them, are, powerful, sources, of, fluorine, atoms, and, industrial, applications, using, chlorine, trifluoride, require, precautions, similar, to, those, using, fluorine, noble, gases, having, complete, electron, shells, defied, reaction, with, other, elements, until, 1962, when, neil, bartlett, reported, synthesis, of, xenon, hexafluoroplatinate, xenon, difluoride, tetrafluoride, hexafluoride, and, multiple, oxyfluorides, have, been, isolated, since, then, among, other, noble, gases, krypton, forms, a, difluoride, and, radon, and, fluorine, generate, a, solid, suspected, to, be, radon, difluoride, binary, fluorides, of, lighter, noble, gases, are, exceptionally, unstable, argon, and, hydrogen, fluoride, combine, under, extreme, conditions, to, give, argon, fluorohydride, helium, has, no, long, lived, fluorides, and, no, neon, fluoride, has, ever, been, observed, helium, fluorohydride, has, been, detected, for, milliseconds, at, high, pressures, and, low, temperatures, the, carbon, fluorine, bond, is, organic, chemistry, s, strongest, and, gives, stability, to, organofluorines, it, is, almost, non, existent, in, nature, but, is, used, in, artificial, compounds, research, in, this, area, is, usually, driven, by, commercial, applications, the, compounds, involved, are, diverse, and, reflect, the, complexity, inherent, in, organic, chemistry, the, substitution, of, hydrogen, atoms, in, an, alkane, by, progressively, more, fluorine, atoms, gradually, alters, several, properties, melting, and, boiling, points, are, lowered, density, increases, solubility, in, hydrocarbons, decreases, and, overall, stability, increases, perfluorocarbons, in, which, all, hydrogen, atoms, are, substituted, are, insoluble, in, most, organic, solvents, reacting, at, ambient, conditions, only, with, sodium, in, liquid, ammonia, the, term, perfluorinated, compound, is, used, for, what, would, otherwise, be, a, perfluorocarbon, if, not, for, the, presence, of, a, functional, group, often, a, carboxylic, acid, these, compounds, share, many, properties, with, perfluorocarbons, such, as, stability, and, hydrophobicity, while, the, functional, group, augments, their, reactivity, enabling, them, to, adhere, to, surfaces, or, act, as, surfactants, fluorosurfactants, in, particular, can, lower, the, surface, tension, of, water, more, than, their, hydrocarbon, based, analogues, fluorotelomers, which, have, some, unfluorinated, carbon, atoms, near, the, functional, group, are, also, regarded, as, perfluorinated, polymers, exhibit, the, same, stability, increases, afforded, by, fluorine, substitution, for, hydrogen, in, discrete, molecules, their, melting, points, generally, increase, too, polytetrafluoroethylene, ptfe, the, simplest, fluoropolymer, and, perfluoro, analogue, of, polyethylene, with, structural, unit, cf, 2, demonstrates, this, change, as, expected, but, its, very, high, melting, point, makes, it, difficult, to, mold, various, ptfe, derivatives, are, less, temperature, tolerant, but, easier, to, mold, fluorinated, ethylene, propylene, replaces, some, fluorine, atoms, with, trifluoromethyl, groups, perfluoroalkoxy, alkanes, do, the, same, with, trifluoromethoxy, groups, and, nafion, contains, perfluoroether, side, chains, capped, with, sulfonic, acid, groups, other, fluoropolymers, retain, some, hydrogen, atoms, polyvinylidene, fluoride, has, half, the, fluorine, atoms, of, ptfe, and, polyvinyl, fluoride, has, a, quarter, but, both, behave, much, like, perfluorinated, polymers, elemental, fluorine, and, virtually, all, fluorine, compounds, are, produced, from, hydrogen, fluoride, or, its, aqueous, solution, hydrofluoric, acid, hydrogen, fluoride, is, produced, in, kilns, by, the, endothermic, reaction, of, fluorite, caf, 2, with, sulfuric, acid, the, gaseous, hf, can, then, be, absorbed, in, water, or, liquefied, about, 20, of, manufactured, hf, is, a, byproduct, of, fertilizer, production, which, produces, hexafluorosilicic, acid, h, 2, sif, 6, which, can, be, degraded, to, release, hf, thermally, and, by, hydrolysis, moissan, s, method, is, used, to, produce, industrial, quantities, of, fluorine, via, the, electrolysis, of, a, potassium, bifluoride, hydrogen, fluoride, mixture, hydrogen, ions, are, reduced, at, a, steel, container, cathode, and, fluoride, ions, are, oxidized, at, a, carbon, block, anode, under, 8, 12, volts, to, generate, hydrogen, and, fluorine, gas, respectively, temperatures, are, elevated, kf, 2hf, melting, at, 70, c, 158, f, and, being, electrolyzed, at, 70, 130, c, 158, 266, f, kf, which, acts, to, provide, electrical, conductivity, is, essential, since, pure, hf, cannot, be, electrolyzed, because, it, is, virtually, non, conductive, fluorine, can, be, stored, in, steel, cylinders, that, have, passivated, interiors, at, temperatures, below, 200, c, 392, f, otherwise, nickel, can, be, used, regulator, valves, and, pipework, are, made, of, nickel, the, latter, possibly, using, monel, instead, frequent, passivation, along, with, the, strict, exclusion, of, water, and, greases, must, be, undertaken, in, the, laboratory, glassware, may, carry, fluorine, gas, under, low, pressure, and, anhydrous, conditions, some, sources, instead, recommend, nickel, monel, ptfe, systems, while, preparing, for, a, 1986, conference, to, celebrate, the, centennial, of, moissan, s, achievement, karl, o, christe, reasoned, that, chemical, fluorine, generation, should, be, feasible, since, some, metal, fluoride, anions, have, no, stable, neutral, counterparts, their, acidification, potentially, triggers, oxidation, instead, he, devised, a, method, which, evolves, fluorine, at, high, yield, and, atmospheric, pressure, christe, later, commented, that, the, reactants, had, been, known, for, more, than, 100, years, and, even, moissan, could, have, come, up, with, this, scheme, as, late, as, 2008, some, references, still, asserted, that, fluorine, was, too, reactive, for, any, chemical, isolation, fluorite, mining, which, supplies, most, global, fluorine, peaked, in, 1989, when, 5, 6, million, metric, tons, of, ore, were, extracted, chlorofluorocarbon, restrictions, lowered, this, to, 3, 6, million, tons, in, 1994, production, has, since, been, increasing, around, 4, 5, million, tons, of, ore, and, revenue, of, us, 550, million, were, generated, in, 2003, later, reports, estimated, 2011, global, fluorochemical, sales, at, 15, billion, and, predicted, 2016, 18, production, figures, of, 3, 5, to, 5, 9, million, tons, and, revenue, of, at, least, 20, billion, froth, flotation, separates, mined, fluorite, into, two, main, metallurgical, grades, of, equal, proportion, 60, 85, pure, metspar, is, almost,

are, used, as, electrochemical, cell, membranes, of, which, the, first, and, most, prominent, example, is, nafion, developed, in, the, 1960s, it, was, initially, deployed, as, fuel, cell, material, in, spacecraft, and, then, replaced, mercury, based, chloralkali, process, cells, recently, the, fuel, cell, application, has, reemerged, with, efforts, to, install, proton, exchange, membrane, fuel, cells, into, automobiles, fluoroelastomers, such, as, viton, are, crosslinked, fluoropolymer, mixtures, mainly, used, in, o, rings, perfluorobutane, c, 4, f, 10, is, used, as, a, fire, extinguishing, agent, fluorosurfactants, are, small, organofluorine, molecules, used, for, repelling, water, and, stains, although, expensive, comparable, to, pharmaceuticals, at, 200, 2000, per, kilogram, they, yielded, over, 1, billion, in, annual, revenues, by, 2006, scotchgard, alone, generated, over, 300, million, in, 2000, fluorosurfactants, are, a, minority, in, the, overall, surfactant, market, most, of, which, is, taken, up, by, much, cheaper, hydrocarbon, based, products, applications, in, paints, are, burdened, by, compounding, costs, this, use, was, valued, at, only, 100, million, in, 2006, about, 30, of, agrichemicals, contain, fluorine, most, of, them, herbicides, and, fungicides, with, a, few, crop, regulators, fluorine, substitution, usually, of, a, single, atom, or, at, most, a, trifluoromethyl, group, is, a, robust, modification, with, effects, analogous, to, fluorinated, pharmaceuticals, increased, biological, stay, time, membrane, crossing, and, altering, of, molecular, recognition, trifluralin, is, a, prominent, example, with, large, scale, use, in, the, u, s, as, a, weedkiller, but, it, is, a, suspected, carcinogen, and, has, been, banned, in, many, european, countries, sodium, monofluoroacetate, 1080, is, a, mammalian, poison, in, which, one, sodium, acetate, hydrogen, is, replaced, with, fluorine, it, disrupts, cell, metabolism, by, replacing, acetate, in, the, citric, acid, cycle, first, synthesized, in, the, late, 19th, century, it, was, recognized, as, an, insecticide, in, the, early, 20th, century, and, was, later, deployed, in, its, current, use, new, zealand, the, largest, consumer, of, 1080, uses, it, to, protect, kiwis, from, the, invasive, australian, common, brushtail, possum, europe, and, the, u, s, have, banned, 1080, population, studies, from, the, mid, 20th, century, onwards, show, topical, fluoride, reduces, dental, caries, this, was, first, attributed, to, the, conversion, of, tooth, enamel, hydroxyapatite, into, the, more, durable, fluorapatite, but, studies, on, pre, fluoridated, teeth, refuted, this, hypothesis, and, current, theories, involve, fluoride, aiding, enamel, growth, in, small, caries, after, studies, of, children, in, areas, where, fluoride, was, naturally, present, in, drinking, water, controlled, public, water, supply, fluoridation, to, fight, tooth, decay, began, in, the, 1940s, and, is, now, applied, to, water, supplying, 6, percent, of, the, global, population, including, two, thirds, of, americans, reviews, of, the, scholarly, literature, in, 2000, and, 2007, associated, water, fluoridation, with, a, significant, reduction, of, tooth, decay, in, children, despite, such, endorsements, and, evidence, of, no, adverse, effects, other, than, mostly, benign, dental, fluorosis, opposition, still, exists, on, ethical, and, safety, grounds, the, benefits, of, fluoridation, have, lessened, possibly, due, to, other, fluoride, sources, but, are, still, measurable, in, low, income, groups, sodium, monofluorophosphate, and, sometimes, sodium, or, tin, ii, fluoride, are, often, found, in, fluoride, toothpastes, first, introduced, in, the, u, s, in, 1955, and, now, ubiquitous, in, developed, countries, alongside, fluoridated, mouthwashes, gels, foams, and, varnishes, twenty, percent, of, modern, pharmaceuticals, contain, fluorine, one, of, these, the, cholesterol, reducer, atorvastatin, lipitor, made, more, revenue, than, any, other, drug, until, it, became, generic, in, 2011, the, combination, asthma, prescription, seretide, a, top, ten, revenue, drug, in, the, mid, 2000s, contains, two, active, ingredients, one, of, which, fluticasone, is, fluorinated, many, drugs, are, fluorinated, to, delay, inactivation, and, lengthen, dosage, periods, because, the, carbon, fluorine, bond, is, very, stable, fluorination, also, increases, lipophilicity, because, the, bond, is, more, hydrophobic, than, the, carbon, hydrogen, bond, and, this, often, helps, in, cell, membrane, penetration, and, hence, bioavailability, tricyclics, and, other, pre, 1980s, antidepressants, had, several, side, effects, due, to, their, non, selective, interference, with, neurotransmitters, other, than, the, serotonin, target, the, fluorinated, fluoxetine, was, selective, and, one, of, the, first, to, avoid, this, problem, many, current, antidepressants, receive, this, same, treatment, including, the, selective, serotonin, reuptake, inhibitors, citalopram, its, enantiomer, escitalopram, and, fluvoxamine, and, paroxetine, quinolones, are, artificial, broad,

blood, pressure, raising, mineralocorticoid, and, triamcinolone, and, dexamethasone, are, strong, glucocorticoids, the, majority, of, inhaled, anesthetics, are, heavily, fluorinated, the, prototype, halothane, is, much, more, inert, and, potent, than, its, contemporaries, later, compounds, such, as, the, fluorinated, ethers, sevoflurane, and, desflurane, are, better, than, halothane, and, are, almost, insoluble, in, blood, allowing, faster, waking, times, fluorine, 18, is, often, found, in, radioactive, tracers, for, positron, emission, tomography, as, its, half, life, of, almost, two, hours, is, long, enough, to, allow, for, its, transport, from, production, facilities, to, imaging, centers, the, most, common, tracer, is, fluorodeoxyglucose, which, after, intravenous, injection, is, taken, up, by, glucose, requiring, tissues, such, as, the, brain, and, most, malignant, tumors, computer, assisted, tomography, can, then, be, used, for, detailed, imaging, liquid, fluorocarbons, can, hold, large, volumes, of, oxygen, or, carbon, dioxide, more, so, than, blood, and, have, attracted, attention, for, their, possible, uses, in, artificial, blood, and, in, liquid, breathing, because, fluorocarbons, do, not, normally, mix, with, water, they, must, be, mixed, into, emulsions, small, droplets, of, perfluorocarbon, suspended, in, water, to, be, used, as, blood, one, such, product, oxycyte, has, been, through, initial, clinical, trials, these, substances, can, aid, endurance, athletes, and, are, banned, from, sports, one, cyclist, s, near, death, in, 1998, prompted, an, investigation, into, their, abuse, applications, of, pure, perfluorocarbon, liquid, breathing, which, uses, pure, perfluorocarbon, liquid, not, a, water, emulsion, include, assisting, burn, victims, and, premature, babies, with, deficient, lungs, partial, and, complete, lung, filling, have, been, considered, though, only, the, former, has, had, any, significant, tests, in, humans, an, alliance, pharmaceuticals, effort, reached, clinical, trials, but, was, abandoned, because, the, results, were, not, better, than, normal, therapies, fluorine, is, not, essential, for, humans, and, other, mammals, but, small, amounts, are, known, to, be, beneficial, for, the, strengthening, of, dental, enamel, where, the, formation, of, fluorapatite, makes, the, enamel, more, resistant, to, attack, from, acids, produced, by, bacterial, fermentation, of, sugars, small, amounts, of, fluorine, may, be, beneficial, for, bone, strength, but, the, latter, has, not, been, definitively, established, both, the, who, and, the, institute, of, medicine, of, the, us, national, academies, publish, recommended, daily, allowance, rda, and, upper, tolerated, intake, of, fluorine, which, varies, with, age, and, gender, natural, organofluorines, have, been, found, in, microorganisms, plants, and, recently, animals, the, most, common, is, fluoroacetate, which, is, used, as, a, defense, against,
