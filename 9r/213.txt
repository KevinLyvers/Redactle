seyfert, galaxies, are, one, of, the, two, largest, groups, of, active, galaxies, along, with, quasar, host, galaxies, they, have, quasar, like, nuclei, very, luminous, sources, of, electromagnetic, radiation, that, are, outside, of, our, own, galaxy, with, very, high, surface, brightnesses, whose, spectra, reveal, strong, high, ionisation, emission, lines, but, unlike, quasars, their, host, galaxies, are, clearly, detectable, seyfert, galaxies, account, for, about, 10, of, all, galaxies, and, are, some, of, the, most, intensely, studied, objects, in, astronomy, as, they, are, thought, to, be, powered, by, the, same, phenomena, that, occur, in, quasars, although, they, are, closer, and, less, luminous, than, quasars, these, galaxies, have, supermassive, black, holes, at, their, centers, which, are, surrounded, by, accretion, discs, of, in, falling, material, the, accretion, discs, are, believed, to, be, the, source, of, the, observed, ultraviolet, radiation, ultraviolet, emission, and, absorption, lines, provide, the, best, diagnostics, for, the, composition, of, the, surrounding, material, seen, in, visible, light, most, seyfert, galaxies, look, like, normal, spiral, galaxies, but, when, studied, under, other, wavelengths, it, becomes, clear, that, the, luminosity, of, their, cores, is, of, comparable, intensity, to, the, luminosity, of, whole, galaxies, the, size, of, the, milky, way, seyfert, galaxies, are, named, after, carl, seyfert, who, first, described, this, class, in, 1943, seyfert, galaxies, were, first, detected, in, 1908, by, edward, a, fath, and, vesto, slipher, who, were, using, the, lick, observatory, to, look, at, the, spectra, of, astronomical, objects, that, were, thought, to, be, spiral, nebulae, they, noticed, that, ngc, 1068, showed, six, bright, emission, lines, which, was, considered, unusual, as, most, objects, observed, showed, an, absorption, spectrum, corresponding, to, stars, in, 1926, edwin, hubble, looked, at, the, emission, lines, of, ngc, 1068, and, two, other, such, nebulae, and, classified, them, as, extragalactic, objects, in, 1943, carl, keenan, seyfert, discovered, more, galaxies, similar, to, ngc, 1068, and, reported, that, these, galaxies, have, very, bright, stellar, like, nuclei, that, produce, broad, emission, lines, in, 1944, cygnus, a, was, detected, at, 160, mhz, and, detection, was, confirmed, in, 1948, when, it, was, established, that, it, was, a, discrete, source, its, double, radio, structure, became, apparent, with, the, use, of, interferometry, in, the, next, few, years, other, radio, sources, such, as, supernova, remnants, were, discovered, by, the, end, of, the, 1950s, more, important, characteristics, of, seyfert, galaxies, were, discovered, including, the, fact, that, their, nuclei, are, extremely, compact, 100, pc, i, e, unresolved, have, high, mass, 10, 9, 1, solar, masses, and, the, duration, of, peak, nuclear, emissions, is, relatively, short, 10, 8, years, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, research, to, further, understand, the, properties, of, seyfert, galaxies, was, carried, out, a, few, direct, measurements, of, the, actual, sizes, of, seyfert, nuclei, were, taken, and, it, was, established, that, the, emission, lines, in, ngc, 1068, were, produced, in, a, region, over, a, thousand, light, years, in, diameter, controversy, existed, over, whether, seyfert, redshifts, were, of, cosmological, origin, confirming, estimates, of, the, distance, to, seyfert, galaxies, and, their, age, were, limited, since, their, nuclei, vary, in, brightness, over, a, time, scale, of, a, few, years, therefore, arguments, involving, distance, to, such, galaxies, and, the, constant, speed, of, light, cannot, always, be, used, to, determine, their, age, in, the, same, time, period, research, had, been, undertaken, to, survey, identify, and, catalogue, galaxies, including, seyferts, beginning, in, 1967, benjamin, markarian, published, lists, containing, a, few, hundred, galaxies, distinguished, by, their, very, strong, ultraviolet, emission, with, measurements, on, the, position, of, some, of, them, being, improved, in, 1973, by, other, researchers, at, the, time, it, was, believed, that, 1, of, spiral, galaxies, are, seyferts, by, 1977, it, was, found, that, very, few, seyfert, galaxies, are, ellipticals, most, of, them, being, spiral, or, barred, spiral, galaxies, during, the, same, time, period, efforts, have, been, made, to, gather, spectrophotometric, data, for, seyfert, galaxies, it, became, obvious, that, not, all, spectra, from, seyfert, galaxies, look, the, same, so, they, have, been, subclassified, according, to, the, characteristics, of, their, emission, spectra, a, simple, division, into, types, i, and, ii, has, been, devised, with, the, classes, depending, on, the, relative, width, of, their, emission, lines, it, has, been, later, noticed, that, some, seyfert, nuclei, show, intermediate, properties, resulting, in, their, being, further, subclassified, into, types, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 8, and, 1, 9, see, classification, early, surveys, for, seyfert, galaxies, were, biased, in, counting, only, the, brightest, representatives, of, this, group, more, recent, surveys, that, count, galaxies, with, low, luminosity, and, obscured, seyfert, nuclei, suggest, that, the, seyfert, phenomenon, is, actually, quite, common, occurring, in, 16, 5, of, galaxies, indeed, several, dozen, galaxies, exhibiting, the, seyfert, phenomenon, exist, in, the, close, vicinity, 27, mpc, of, our, own, galaxy, seyfert, galaxies, form, a, substantial, fraction, of, the, galaxies, appearing, in, the, markarian, catalog, a, list, of, galaxies, displaying, an, ultraviolet, excess, in, their, nuclei, an, active, galactic, nucleus, agn, is, a, compact, region, at, the, center, of, a, galaxy, that, has, a, higher, than, normal, luminosity, over, portions, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, a, galaxy, having, an, active, nucleus, is, called, an, active, galaxy, active, galactic, nuclei, are, the, most, luminous, sources, of, electromagnetic, radiation, in, the, universe, and, their, evolution, puts, constraints, on, cosmological, models, depending, on, the, type, their, luminosity, varies, over, a, timescale, from, a, few, hours, to, a, few, years, the, two, largest, subclasses, of, active, galaxies, are, quasars, and, seyfert, galaxies, the, main, difference, between, the, two, being, the, amount, of, radiation, they, emit, in, a, typical, seyfert, galaxy, the, nuclear, source, emits, at, visible, wavelengths, an, amount, of, radiation, comparable, to, that, of, the, whole, galaxy, s, constituent, stars, while, in, a, quasar, the, nuclear, source, is, brighter, than, the, constituent, stars, by, at, least, a, factor, of, 100, seyfert, galaxies, have, extremely, bright, nuclei, with, luminosities, ranging, between, 10, 8, and, 10, 11, solar, luminosities, only, about, 5, of, them, are, radio, bright, their, emissions, are, moderate, in, gamma, rays, and, bright, in, x, rays, their, visible, and, infrared, spectra, show, very, bright, emission, lines, of, hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, and, oxygen, these, emission, lines, exhibit, strong, doppler, broadening, which, implies, velocities, from, 500, to, 4, 000, km, s, 310, to, 2, 490, mi, s, and, are, believed, to, originate, near, an, accretion, disc, surrounding, the, central, black, hole, a, lower, limit, to, the, mass, of, the, central, black, hole, can, be, calculated, using, the, eddington, luminosity, this, limit, arises, because, light, exhibits, radiation, pressure, assume, that, a, black, hole, is, surrounded, by, a, disc, of, luminous, gas, both, the, attractive, gravitational, force, acting, on, electron, ion, pairs, in, the, disc, and, the, repulsive, force, exerted, by, radiation, pressure, follow, an, inverse, square, law, if, the, gravitational, force, exerted, by, the, black, hole, is, less, than, the, repulsive, force, due, to, radiation, pressure, the, disc, will, be, blown, away, by, radiation, pressure, the, emission, lines, seen, on, the, spectrum, of, a, seyfert, galaxy, may, come, from, the, surface, of, the, accretion, disc, itself, or, may, come, from, clouds, of, gas, illuminated, by, the, central, engine, in, an, ionization, cone, the, exact, geometry, of, the, emitting, region, is, difficult, to, determine, due, to, poor, resolution, of, the, galactic, center, however, each, part, of, the, accretion, disc, has, a, different, velocity, relative, to, our, line, of, sight, and, the, faster, the, gas, is, rotating, around, the, black, hole, the, broader, the, emission, line, will, be, similarly, an, illuminated, disc, wind, also, has, a, position, dependent, velocity, the, narrow, lines, are, believed, to, originate, from, the, outer, part, of, the, active, galactic, nucleus, where, velocities, are, lower, while, the, broad, lines, originate, closer, to, the, black, hole, this, is, confirmed, by, the, fact, that, the, narrow, lines, do, not, vary, detectably, which, implies, that, the, emitting, region, is, large, contrary, to, the, broad, lines, which, can, vary, on, relatively, short, timescales, reverberation, mapping, is, a, technique, which, uses, this, variability, to, try, to, determine, the, location, and, morphology, of, the, emitting, region, this, technique, measures, the, structure, and, kinematics, of, the, broad, line, emitting, region, by, observing, the, changes, in, the, emitted, lines, as, a, response, to, changes, in, the, continuum, the, use, of, reverberation, mapping, requires, the, assumption, that, the, continuum, originates, in, a, single, central, source, for, 35, agn, reverberation, mapping, has, been, used, to, calculate, the, mass, of, the, central, black, holes, and, the, size, of, the, broad, line, regions, in, the, few, radio, loud, seyfert, galaxies, that, have, been, observed, the, radio, emission, is, believed, to, represent, synchrotron, emission, from, the, jet, the, infrared, emission, is, due, to, radiation, in, other, bands, being, reprocessed, by, dust, near, the, nucleus, the, highest, energy, photons, are, believed, to, be, created, by, inverse, compton, scattering, by, a, high, temperature, corona, near, the, black, hole, seyferts, were, first, classified, as, type, i, or, ii, depending, on, the, emission, lines, shown, by, their, spectra, the, spectra, of, type, i, seyfert, galaxies, show, broad, lines, that, include, both, allowed, lines, like, h, i, he, i, or, he, ii, and, narrower, forbidden, lines, like, o, iii, they, show, some, narrower, allowed, lines, as, well, but, even, these, narrow, lines, are, much, broader, than, the, lines, shown, by, normal, galaxies, however, the, spectra, of, type, ii, seyfert, galaxies, show, only, narrow, lines, both, permitted, and, forbidden, forbidden, lines, are, spectral, lines, that, occur, due, to, electron, transitions, not, normally, allowed, by, the, selection, rules, of, quantum, mechanics, but, that, still, have, a, small, probability, of, spontaneously, occurring, the, term, forbidden, is, slightly, misleading, as, the, electron, transitions, causing, them, are, not, forbidden, but, highly, improbable, in, some, cases, the, spectra, show, both, broad, and, narrow, permitted, lines, which, is, why, they, are, classified, as, an, intermediate, type, between, type, i, and, type, ii, such, as, type, 1, 5, seyfert, the, spectra, of, some, of, these, galaxies, have, changed, from, type, 1, 5, to, type, ii, in, a, matter, of, a, few, years, however, the, characteristic, broad, h, emission, line, has, rarely, if, ever, disappeared, the, origin, of, the, differences, between, type, i, and, type, ii, seyfert, galaxies, is, not, known, yet, there, are, a, few, cases, where, galaxies, have, been, identified, as, type, ii, only, because, the, broad, components, of, the, spectral, lines, have, been, very, hard, to, detect, it, is, believed, by, some, that, all, type, ii, seyferts, are, in, fact, type, i, where, the, broad, components, of, the, lines, are, impossible, to, detect, because, of, the, angle, we, are, at, with, respect, to, the, galaxy, specifically, in, type, i, seyfert, galaxies, we, observe, the, central, compact, source, more, or, less, directly, therefore, sampling, the, high, velocity, clouds, in, the, broad, line, emission, region, moving, around, the, supermassive, black, hole, thought, to, be, at, the, center, of, the, galaxy, by, contrast, in, type, ii, seyfert, galaxies, the, active, nuclei, are, obscured, and, only, the, colder, outer, regions, located, further, away, from, the, clouds, broad, line, emission, region, are, seen, this, theory, is, known, as, the, unification, scheme, of, seyfert, galaxies, however, it, is, not, yet, clear, if, this, hypothesis, can, explain, all, the, observed, differences, between, the, two, types, type, i, seyferts, are, very, bright, sources, of, ultraviolet, light, and, x, rays, in, addition, to, the, visible, light, coming, from, their, cores, they, have, two, sets, of, emission, lines, on, their, spectra, narrow, lines, with, widths, measured, in, velocity, units, of, several, hundred, km, s, and, broad, lines, with, widths, up, to, 10, 4, km, s, the, broad, lines, originate, above, the, accretion, disc, of, the, supermassive, black, hole, thought, to, power, the, galaxy, while, the, narrow, lines, occur, beyond, the, broad, line, region, of, the, accretion, disc, both, emissions, are, caused, by, heavily, ionised, gas, the, broad, line, emission, arises, in, a, region, 0, 1, 1, parsec, across, the, broad, line, emission, region, r, blr, can, be, estimated, from, the, time, delay, corresponding, to, the, time, taken, by, light, to, travel, from, the, continuum, source, to, the, line, emitting, gas, type, ii, seyfert, galaxies, have, the, characteristic, bright, core, as, well, as, appearing, bright, when, viewed, at, infrared, wavelengths, their, spectra, contain, narrow, lines, associated, with, forbidden, transitions, and, broader, lines, associated, with, allowed, strong, dipole, or, intercombination, transitions, ngc, 3147, is, considered, the, best, candidate, to, be, a, true, type, ii, seyfert, galaxy, in, some, type, ii, seyfert, galaxies, analysis, with, a, technique, called, spectro, polarimetry, spectroscopy, of, polarised, light, component, revealed, obscured, type, i, regions, in, the, case, of, ngc, 1068, nuclear, light, reflected, off, a, dust, cloud, was, measured, which, led, scientists, to, believe, in, the, presence, of, an, obscuring, dust, torus, around, a, bright, continuum, and, broad, emission, line, nucleus, when, the, galaxy, is, viewed, from, the, side, the, nucleus, is, indirectly, observed, through, reflection, by, gas, and, dust, above, and, below, the, torus, this, reflection, causes, the, polarisation, in, 1981, donald, osterbrock, introduced, the, notations, type, 1, 5, 1, 8, and, 1, 9, where, the, subclasses, are, based, on, the, optical, appearance, of, the, spectrum, with, the, numerically, larger, subclasses, having, weaker, broad, line, components, relative, to, the, narrow, lines, for, example, type, 1, 9, only, shows, a, broad, component, in, the, h, line, and, not, in, higher, order, balmer, lines, in, type, 1, 8, very, weak, broad, lines, can, be, detected, in, the, h, lines, as, well, as, h, even, if, they, are, very, weak, compared, to, the, h, in, type, 1, 5, the, strength, of, the, h, and, h, lines, are, comparable, in, addition, to, the, seyfert, progression, from, type, i, to, type, ii, including, type, 1, 2, to, type, 1, 9, there, are, other, types, of, galaxies, that, are, very, similar, to, seyferts, or, that, can, be, considered, as, subclasses, of, them, very, similar, to, seyferts, are, the, low, ionisation, narrow, line, emission, radio, galaxies, liner, discovered, in, 1980, these, galaxies, have, strong, emission, lines, from, weakly, ionised, or, neutral, atoms, while, the, emission, lines, from, strongly, ionised, atoms, are, relatively, weak, by, comparison, liners, share, a, large, amount, of, traits, with, low, luminosity, seyferts, in, fact, when, seen, in, visible, light, the, global, characteristics, of, their, host, galaxies, are, indistinguishable, also, they, both, show, a, broad, line, emission, region, but, the, line, emitting, region, in, liners, has, a, lower, density, than, in, seyferts, an, example, of, such, a, galaxy, is, m104, in, the, virgo, constellation, also, known, as, the, sombrero, galaxy, a, galaxy, that, is, both, a, liner, and, a, type, i, seyfert, is, ngc, 7213, a, galaxy, that, is, relatively, close, compared, to, other, agns, another, very, interesting, subclass, are, the, narrow, line, type, i, galaxies, nlsy1, which, have, been, subject, to, extensive, research, in, recent, years, they, have, much, narrower, lines, than, the, broad, lines, from, classic, type, i, galaxies, steep, hard, and, soft, x, ray, spectra, and, strong, fe, emission, their, properties, suggest, that, nlsy1, galaxies, are, young, agns, with, high, accretion, rates, suggesting, a, relatively, small, but, growing, central, black, hole, mass, there, are, theories, suggesting, that, nlsy1s, are, galaxies, in, an, early, stage, of, evolution, and, links, between, them, and, ultraluminous, infrared, galaxies, or, type, ii, galaxies, have, been, proposed, the, majority, of, active, galaxies, are, very, distant, and, show, large, doppler, shifts, this, suggests, that, active, galaxies, occurred, in, the, early, universe, and, due, to, cosmic, expansion, are, receding, away, from, the, milky, way, at, very, high, speeds, quasars, are, the, furthest, active, galaxies, some, of, them, being, observed, at, distances, 12, billion, light, years, away, seyfert, galaxies, are, much, closer, than, quasars, because, light, has, a, finite, speed, looking, across, large, distances, in, the, universe, is, equivalent, to, looking, back, in, time, therefore, the, observation, of, active, galactic, nuclei, at, large, distances, and, their, scarcity, in, the, nearby, universe, suggests, that, they, were, much, more, common, in, the, early, universe, implying, that, active, galactic, nuclei, could, be, early, stages, of, galactic, evolution, this, leads, to, the, question, about, what, would, be, the, local, modern, day, counterparts, of, agns, found, at, large, redshifts, it, has, been, proposed, that, nlsy1s, could, be, the, small, redshift, counterparts, of, quasars, found, at, large, redshifts, z, 4, the, two, have, many, similar, properties, for, example, high, metallicities, or, similar, pattern, of, emission, lines, strong, fe, weak, o, some, observations, suggest, that, agn, emission, from, the, nucleus, is, not, spherically, symmetric, and, that, the, nucleus, often, shows, axial, symmetry, with, radiation, escaping, in, a, conical, region, based, on, these, observations, models, have, been, devised, to, explain, the, different, classes, of, agns, as, due, to, their, different, orientations, with, respect, to, the, observational, line, of, sight, such, models, are, called, unified, models, unified, models, explain, the, difference, between, type, i, and, type, ii, galaxies, as, being, the, result, of, type, ii, galaxies, being, surrounded, by, obscuring, toruses, which, prevent, telescopes, from, seeing, the, broad, line, region, quasars, and, blazars, can, be, fit, quite, easily, in, this, model, the, main, problem, of, such, a, unification, scheme, is, trying, to, explain, why, some, agn, are, radio, loud, while, others, are, radio, quiet, it, has, been, suggested, that, these, differences, may, be, due, to, differences, in, the, spin, of, the, central, black, hole, here, are, some, examples, of, seyfert, galaxies, we, derive, the, outward, radiative, force, f, rad, as, we, do, for, stars, assuming, spherical, symmetry, f, rad, d, p, d, t, 1, c, d, e, d, t, 1, c, t, l, 4, r, 2, displaystyle,
