an, electric, field, sometimes, called, e, field, is, the, physical, field, that, surrounds, electrically, charged, particles, charged, particles, exert, attractive, forces, on, each, other, when, their, charges, are, opposite, and, repulse, each, other, when, their, charges, are, the, same, because, these, forces, are, exerted, mutually, two, charges, must, be, present, for, the, forces, to, take, place, the, electric, field, of, a, single, charge, or, group, of, charges, describes, their, capacity, to, exert, such, forces, on, another, charged, object, these, forces, are, described, by, coulomb, s, law, which, says, that, the, greater, the, magnitude, of, the, charges, the, greater, the, force, and, the, greater, the, distance, between, them, the, weaker, the, force, thus, we, may, informally, say, that, the, greater, the, charge, of, an, object, the, stronger, its, electric, field, similarly, an, electric, field, is, stronger, nearer, charged, objects, and, weaker, further, away, electric, fields, originate, from, electric, charges, and, time, varying, electric, currents, electric, fields, and, magnetic, fields, are, both, manifestations, of, the, electromagnetic, field, electromagnetism, is, one, of, the, four, fundamental, interactions, of, nature, electric, fields, are, important, in, many, areas, of, physics, and, are, exploited, in, electrical, technology, for, example, in, atomic, physics, and, chemistry, the, interaction, in, the, electric, field, between, the, atomic, nucleus, and, electrons, is, the, force, that, holds, these, particles, together, in, atoms, similarly, the, interaction, in, the, electric, field, between, atoms, is, the, force, responsible, for, chemical, bonding, that, result, in, molecules, the, electric, field, is, defined, as, a, vector, field, that, associates, to, each, point, in, space, the, force, per, unit, of, charge, exerted, on, an, infinitesimal, test, charge, at, rest, at, that, point, the, si, unit, for, the, electric, field, is, the, volt, per, meter, v, m, which, is, equal, to, the, newton, per, coulomb, n, c, the, electric, field, is, defined, at, each, point, in, space, as, the, force, that, would, be, experienced, by, a, infinitesimally, small, stationary, test, charge, at, that, point, divided, by, the, charge, 469, 70, the, electric, field, is, defined, in, terms, of, force, and, force, is, a, vector, i, e, having, both, magnitude, and, direction, so, it, follows, that, an, electric, field, may, be, described, by, a, vector, field, 469, 70, the, electric, field, acts, between, two, charges, similarly, to, the, way, that, the, gravitational, field, acts, between, two, masses, as, they, both, obey, an, inverse, square, law, with, distance, this, is, the, basis, for, coulomb, s, law, which, states, that, for, stationary, charges, the, electric, field, varies, with, the, source, charge, and, varies, inversely, with, the, square, of, the, distance, from, the, source, this, means, that, if, the, source, charge, were, doubled, the, electric, field, would, double, and, if, you, move, twice, as, far, away, from, the, source, the, field, at, that, point, would, be, only, one, quarter, its, original, strength, the, electric, field, can, be, visualized, with, a, set, of, lines, whose, direction, at, each, point, is, the, same, as, those, of, the, field, a, concept, introduced, by, michael, faraday, whose, term, lines, of, force, is, still, sometimes, used, this, illustration, has, the, useful, property, that, the, strength, of, the, field, is, proportional, to, the, density, of, the, lines, field, lines, due, to, stationary, charges, have, several, important, properties, including, always, originating, from, positive, charges, and, terminating, at, negative, charges, they, enter, all, good, conductors, at, right, angles, and, they, never, cross, or, close, in, on, themselves, 479, the, field, lines, are, a, representative, concept, the, field, actually, permeates, all, the, intervening, space, between, the, lines, more, or, fewer, lines, may, be, drawn, depending, on, the, precision, to, which, it, is, desired, to, represent, the, field, the, study, of, electric, fields, created, by, stationary, charges, is, called, electrostatics, faraday, s, law, describes, the, relationship, between, a, time, varying, magnetic, field, and, the, electric, field, one, way, of, stating, faraday, s, law, is, that, the, curl, of, the, electric, field, is, equal, to, the, negative, time, derivative, of, the, magnetic, field, 327, in, the, absence, of, time, varying, magnetic, field, the, electric, field, is, therefore, called, conservative, i, e, curl, free, 24, 90, 91, this, implies, there, are, two, kinds, of, electric, fields, electrostatic, fields, and, fields, arising, from, time, varying, magnetic, fields, 305, 307, while, the, curl, free, nature, of, the, static, electric, field, allows, for, a, simpler, treatment, using, electrostatics, time, varying, magnetic, fields, are, generally, treated, as, a, component, of, a, unified, electromagnetic, field, the, study, of, magnetic, and, electric, fields, that, change, over, time, is, called, electrodynamics, electric, fields, are, caused, by, electric, charges, described, by, gauss, s, law, and, time, varying, magnetic, fields, described, by, faraday, s, law, of, induction, together, these, laws, are, enough, to, define, the, behavior, of, the, electric, field, however, since, the, magnetic, field, is, described, as, a, function, of, electric, field, the, equations, of, both, fields, are, coupled, and, together, form, maxwell, s, equations, that, describe, both, fields, as, a, function, of, charges, and, currents, in, the, special, case, of, a, steady, state, stationary, charges, and, currents, the, maxwell, faraday, inductive, effect, disappears, the, resulting, two, equations, gauss, s, law, e, 0, displaystyle, nabla, cdot, mathbf, e, frac, rho, varepsilon, 0, and, faraday, s, law, with, no, induction, term, e, 0, displaystyle, nabla, times, mathbf, e, 0, taken, together, are, equivalent, to, coulomb, s, law, which, states, that, a, particle, with, electric, charge, q, 1, displaystyle, q, 1, at, position, r, 1, displaystyle, mathbf, r, 1, exerts, a, force, on, a, particle, with, charge, q, 0, displaystyle, q, 0, at, position, r, 0,

varepsilon, permittivity, when, charges, are, in, non, empty, media, when, the, charges, q, 0, displaystyle, q, 0, and, q, 1, displaystyle, q, 1, have, the, same, sign, this, force, is, positive, directed, away, from, the, other, charge, indicating, the, particles, repel, each, other, when, the, charges, have, unlike, signs, the, force, is, negative, indicating, the, particles, attract, to, make, it, easy, to, calculate, the, coulomb, force, on, any, charge, at, position, r, 0, displaystyle, mathbf, r, 0, this, expression, can, be, divided, by, q, 0, displaystyle, q, 0, leaving, an, expression, that, only, depends, on, the, other, charge, the, source, charge, e, 1, r, 0, f, 01, q, 0, q, 1, 4, 0, r, 01, r, 01, 2, q, 1, 4, 0, r, 01, r, 01, 3, displaystyle, mathbf, e, 1, mathbf, r,

the, electric, field, at, point, r, 0, displaystyle, mathbf, r, 0, due, to, the, point, charge, q, 1, displaystyle, q, 1, it, is, a, vector, valued, function, equal, to, the, coulomb, force, per, unit, charge, that, a, positive, point, charge, would, experience, at, the, position, r, 0, displaystyle, mathbf, r, 0, since, this, formula, gives, the, electric, field, magnitude, and, direction, at, any, point, r, 0, displaystyle, mathbf, r, 0, in, space, except, at, the, location, of, the, charge, itself, r, 1, displaystyle, mathbf, r, 1, where, it, becomes, infinite, it, defines, a, vector, field, from, the, above, formula, it, can, be, seen, that, the, electric, field, due, to, a, point, charge, is, everywhere, directed, away, from, the, charge, if, it, is, positive, and, toward, the, charge, if, it, is, negative, and, its, magnitude, decreases, with, the, inverse, square, of, the, distance, from, the, charge, the, coulomb, force, on, a, charge, of, magnitude, q, displaystyle, q, at, any, point, in, space, is, equal, to, the, product, of, the, charge, and, the, electric, field, at, that, point, f, q, e, displaystyle, mathbf, f, q, mathbf, e, the, si, unit, of, the, electric,

where, the, superposition, principle, allows, for, the, calculation, of, the, electric, field, due, to, a, distribution, of, charge, density, r, displaystyle, rho, mathbf, r, by, considering, the,

to, define, d, the, physical, interpretation, of, d, is, not, as, clear, as, e, effectively, the, field, applied, to, the, material, or, p, induced, field, due, to, the, dipoles, in, the, material, but, still, serves, as, a, convenient, mathematical, simplification, since, maxwell, s, equations, can, be, simplified, in, terms, of, free, charges, and, currents, the, e, and, d, fields, are, related, by, the, permittivity, of, the, material, for, linear, homogeneous, isotropic, materials, e, and, d, are, proportional, and, constant, throughout, the, region, there, is, no, position,

the, electric, field, of, a, uniformly, moving, point, charge, the, charge, of, a, particle, is, considered, frame, invariant, as, supported, by, experimental, evidence, alternatively, the, electric, field, of, uniformly, moving, point, charges, can, be, derived, from, the, lorentz, transformation, of, four, force, experienced, by, test, charges, in, the, source, s, rest, frame, given, by, coulomb, s, law, and, assigning, electric, field, and, magnetic, field, by, their, definition, given, by, the, form, of, lorentz, force, however, the, following, equation, is, only, applicable, when, no, acceleration, is, involved, in, the, particle, s, history, where, coulomb, s, law, can, be, considered, or, symmetry, arguments, can, be, used, for, solving, maxwell, s, equations, in, a, simple, manner, the, electric, field, of, such, a, uniformly, moving, point, charge, is, hence, given, by, e, q, 4, 0, r, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, sin, 2, 3, 2, r, displaystyle, mathbf, e, frac, q, 4, pi, varepsilon,

between, r, displaystyle, mathbf, r, and, the, observed, velocity, of, the, charged, particle, the, above, equation, reduces, to, that, given, by, coulomb, s, law, for, non, relativistic, speeds, of, the, point, charge, spherical, symmetry, is, not, satisfied, due, to, breaking, of, symmetry, in, the, problem, by, specification, of, direction, of, velocity, for, calculation, of, field, to, illustrate, this, field, lines, of, moving, charges, are, sometimes, represented, as, unequally, spaced, radial, lines, which, would, appear, equally, spaced, in, a, co, moving, reference, frame, special, theory, of, relativity, imposes, the, principle, of, locality, that, requires, cause, and, effect, to, be, time, like, separated, events, where, the, causal, efficacy, does, not, travel, faster, than, the, speed, of, light, maxwell, s, laws, are, found, to, confirm, to, this, view, since, the, general, solutions, of, fields, are, given, in, terms, of, retarded, time, which, indicate, that, electromagnetic, disturbances, travel, at, the, speed, of, light, advanced, time, which, also, provides, a, solution, for, maxwell, s, law, are, ignored, as, an, unphysical, solution, for, the, motion, of, a, charged, particle, considering, for, example, the, case, of, a, moving, particle, with, the, above, described, electric, field, coming, to, an, abrupt, stop, the, electric, fields, at, points, far, from, it, do, not, immediately, revert, to, that, classically, given, for, a, stationary, charge, on, stopping, the, field, around, the, stationary, points, begin, to, revert, to, the, expected, state, and, this, effect, propagates, outwards, at, the, speed, of, light, while, the, electric, field, lines, far, away, from, this, will, continue, to, point, radially, towards, an, assumed, moving, charge, this, virtual, particle, will, never, be, outside, the, range, of, propagation, of, the, disturbance, in, electromagnetic, field, since, charged, particles, are, restricted, to, have, speeds, slower, than, that, of, light, which, makes, it, impossible, to, construct, a, gaussian, surface, in, this, region, that, violates, gauss, s, law, another, technical, difficulty, that, supports, this, is, that, charged, particles, travelling, faster, than, or, equal, to, speed, of, light, no, longer, have, a, unique, retarded, time, since, electric, field, lines, are, continuous, an, electromagnetic, pulse, of, radiation, is, generated, that, connects, at, the, boundary, of, this, disturbance, travelling, outwards, at, the, speed, of, light, in, general, any,

of, potential, fields, such, as, lorenz, gauge, fields, at, the, speed, of, light, needs, to, be, accounted, for, by, using, li, nard, wiechert, potential, since, the, potentials, satisfy, maxwell, s,
