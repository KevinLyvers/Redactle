protactinium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, pa, and, atomic, number, 91, it, is, a, dense, radioactive, silvery, gray, actinide, metal, which, readily, reacts, with, oxygen, water, vapor, and, inorganic, acids, it, forms, various, chemical, compounds, in, which, protactinium, is, usually, present, in, the, oxidation, state, 5, but, it, can, also, assume, 4, and, even, 3, or, 2, states, concentrations, of, protactinium, in, the, earth, s, crust, are, typically, a, few, parts, per, trillion, but, may, reach, up, to, a, few, parts, per, million, in, some, uraninite, ore, deposits, because, of, its, scarcity, high, radioactivity, and, high, toxicity, there, are, currently, no, uses, for, protactinium, outside, scientific, research, and, for, this, purpose, protactinium, is, mostly, extracted, from, spent, nuclear, fuel, the, element, was, first, identified, in, 1913, by, kazimierz, fajans, and, oswald, helmuth, g, hring, and, named, brevium, because, of, the, short, half, life, of, the, specific, isotope, studied, protactinium, 234, m, a, more, stable, isotope, of, protactinium, 231, pa, was, discovered, in, 1917, 18, by, lise, meitner, in, collaboration, with, otto, hahn, and, they, named, the, element, protactinium, in, 1949, the, iupac, chose, the, name, protactinium, and, confirmed, hahn, and, meitner, as, its, discoverers, the, new, name, meant, nuclear, precursor, of, actinium, suggesting, that, actinium, is, a, product, of, radioactive, decay, of, protactinium, john, arnold, cranston, working, with, frederick, soddy, and, ada, hitchins, is, also, credited, with, discovering, the, most, stable, isotope, in, 1915, but, he, delayed, his, announcement, due, to, being, called, for, service, in, the, first, world, war, the, longest, lived, and, most, abundant, nearly, 100, naturally, occurring, isotope, of, protactinium, protactinium, 231, has, a, half, life, of, 32, 760, years, and, is, a, decay, product, of, uranium, 235, much, smaller, trace, amounts, of, the, short, lived, protactinium, 234, and, its, nuclear, isomer, protactinium, 234m, occur, in, the, decay, chain, of, uranium, 238, protactinium, 233, occurs, as, a, result, of, the, decay, of, thorium, 233, as, part, of, the, chain, of, events, necessary, to, produce, uranium, 233, by, neutron, irradiation, of, thorium, 232, it, is, an, undesired, intermediate, product, in, thorium, based, nuclear, reactors, and, is, therefore, removed, from, the, active, zone, of, the, reactor, during, the, breeding, process, ocean, science, utilizes, the, element, to, understand, the, ancient, ocean, s, geography, analysis, of, the, relative, concentrations, of, various, uranium, thorium, and, protactinium, isotopes, in, water, and, minerals, is, used, in, radiometric, dating, of, sediments, up, to, 175, 000, years, old, and, in, modeling, of, various, geological, processes, in, 1871, dmitri, mendeleev, predicted, the, existence, of, an, element, between, thorium, and, uranium, the, actinide, series, was, unknown, at, the, time, so, mendeleev, positioned, uranium, below, tungsten, in, group, vi, and, thorium, below, zirconium, in, group, iv, leaving, the, space, below, tantalum, in, group, v, empty, until, the, general, acceptance, of, the, actinide, concept, in, the, late, 1940s, periodic, tables, were, published, with, this, structure, for, a, long, time, chemists, searched, for, eka, tantalum, as, an, element, with, similar, chemical, properties, to, tantalum, making, a, discovery, of, protactinium, nearly, impossible, tantalum, s, heavier, analogue, was, later, found, to, be, the, transuranic, element, dubnium, although, dubnium, is, more, chemically, similar, to, protactinium, not, tantalum, in, 1900, william, crookes, isolated, protactinium, as, an, intensely, radioactive, material, from, uranium, however, he, could, not, characterize, it, as, a, new, chemical, element, and, thus, named, it, uranium, x, ux, crookes, dissolved, uranium, nitrate, in, ether, and, the, residual, aqueous, phase, contained, most, of, the, 234, 90, th, and, 234, 91, pa, his, method, was, used, into, the, 1950s, to, isolate, 234, 90, th, and, 234, 91, pa, from, uranium, compounds, protactinium, was, first, identified, in, 1913, when, kasimir, fajans, and, oswald, helmuth, g, hring, encountered, the, isotope, 234m, pa, during, their, studies, of, the, decay, chains, of, uranium, 238, 238, 92, u, 234, 90, th, 234m, 91, pa, 234, 92, u, they, named, the, new, element, brevium, from, the, latin, word, brevis, meaning, brief, or, short, because, of, the, short, half, life, of, 1, 16, minutes, for, 234m, 91, pa, uranium, x2, in, 1917, 18, two, groups, of, scientists, lise, meitner, in, collaboration, with, otto, hahn, of, germany, and, frederick, soddy, and, john, cranston, of, great, britain, independently, discovered, another, isotope, 231, pa, having, a, much, longer, half, life, of, 32, 760, years, meitner, changed, the, name, brevium, to, protactinium, as, the, new, element, was, part, of, the, decay, chain, of, uranium, 235, as, the, parent, of, actinium, from, the, greek, pr, tos, meaning, first, before, the, iupac, confirmed, this, naming, in, 1949, the, discovery, of, protactinium, completed, one, of, the, last, gaps, in, early, versions, of, the, periodic, table, and, brought, fame, to, the, involved, scientists, aristid, von, grosse, produced, 2, milligrams, of, pa, 2, o, 5, in, 1927, and, in, 1934, first, isolated, elemental, protactinium, from, 0, 1, milligrams, of, pa, 2, o, 5, he, used, two, different, procedures, in, the, first, protactinium, oxide, was, irradiated, by, 35, kev, electrons, in, vacuum, in, the, other, called, the, van, arkel, de, boer, process, the, oxide, was, chemically, converted, to, a, halide, chloride, bromide, or, iodide, and, then, reduced, in, a, vacuum, with, an, electrically, heated, metallic, filament, in, 1961, the, united, kingdom, atomic, energy, authority, ukaea, produced, 127, grams, of, 99, 9, pure, protactinium, 231, by, processing, 60, tonnes, of, waste, material, in, a, 12, stage, process, at, a, cost, of, about, us, 500,

1, mev, 233, pa, the, other, isotope, of, protactinium, produced, in, nuclear, reactors, also, has, a, fission, threshold, of, 1, mev, protactinium, is, one, of, the, rarest, and, most, expensive, naturally, occurring, elements, it, is, found, in, the, form, of, two, isotopes, 231, pa, and, 234, pa, with, the, isotope, 234, pa, occurring, in, two, different, energy, states, nearly, all, natural, protactinium, is, protactinium, 231, it, is, an, alpha, emitter, and, is, formed, by, the, decay, of, uranium, 235, whereas, the, beta, radiating, protactinium, 234, is, produced, as, a, result, of, uranium, 238, decay, nearly, all, uranium, 238, 99, 8, decays, first, to, the, shorter, lived, 234m, pa, isomer, protactinium, occurs, in, uraninite, pitchblende, at, concentrations, of,

days, and, high, cross, section, for, neutron, capture, the, so, called, neutron, poison, thus, instead, of, rapidly, decaying, to, the, useful, 233, u, a, significant, fraction, of, 233, pa, converts, to, non, fissile, isotopes, and, consumes, neutrons, degrading, reactor, efficiency, to, limit, the, loss, of, neutrons, 233, pa, is, extracted, from, the, active, zone, of, thorium, molten, salt, reactors, during, their, operation, so, that, it, can, only, decay, into, 233, u, extraction, of, 233, pa, is, achieved, using, columns, of, molten, bismuth, with, lithium, dissolved, in, it, in, short, lithium, selectively, reduces, protactinium, salts, to, protactinium, metal, which, is, then, extracted, from, the, molten, salt, cycle, while, the, molten, bismuth, is, merely, a, carrier, selected, due, to, its, low, melting, point, of, 271, c, low, vapor, pressure, good, solubility, for, lithium, and, actinides, and, immiscibility, with, molten, halides, before, the, advent, of, nuclear, reactors, protactinium, was, separated, for, scientific, experiments, from, uranium, ores, since, reactors, have, become, more, common, it, is, mostly, produced, as, an, intermediate, product, of, nuclear, fission, in, thorium, high, temperature, reactors, as, an, intermediate, in, the, production, of, the, fissile, uranium, 233, the, isotope, 231, pa, can, be, prepared, by,

table, between, uranium, and, thorium, both, of, which, have, numerous, applications, there, are, currently, no, uses, for, protactinium, outside, scientific, research, owing, to, its, scarcity, high, radioactivity, and, high, toxicity, protactinium, 231, arises, naturally, from, the, decay, of, natural, uranium, 235, and, artificially, in, nuclear, reactors, by, the, reaction, 232, th, n, 231, th, 2n, and, the, subsequent, beta, decay, of, 231, th, it, was, once, thought, to, be, able, to, support, a, nuclear, chain, reaction, which, could, in, principle, be, used, to, build, nuclear, weapons, the, physicist, walter, seifritz, once, estimated, the, associated, critical, mass, as, 750, 180, kg, however, the, possibility, of, criticality, of, 231, pa, has, since, been, ruled, out, with, the, advent, of, highly, sensitive, mass, spectrometers, an, application, of, 231, pa, as, a, tracer, in, geology, and, paleoceanography, has, become, possible, in, this, application, the, ratio, of, protactinium, 231, to, thorium, 230, is, used, for, radiometric, dating, of, sediments, which, are, up, to, 175, 000, years, old, and, in, modeling, of, the, formation, of, minerals, in, particular, its, evaluation, in, oceanic, sediments, helped, to, reconstruct, the, movements, of, north, atlantic, water, bodies, during, the, last, melting, of, ice, age, glaciers, some, of, the, protactinium, related, dating, variations, rely, on, analysis, of, the, relative, concentrations, of, several, long, living, members, of, the, uranium, decay, chain, uranium, protactinium, and, thorium, for, example, these, elements, have, 6, 5, and, 4, valence, electrons, thus, favoring, 6, 5, and, 4, oxidation, states, respectively, and, display, different, physical, and, chemical, properties, thorium, and, protactinium, but, not, uranium, compounds, are, poorly, soluble, in, aqueous, solutions, and, precipitate, into, sediments, the, precipitation, rate, is, faster, for, thorium, than, for, protactinium, the, concentration, analysis, for, both, protactinium, 231, half, life, 32, 760, years, and, thorium, 230, half, life, 75, 380, years, improves, measurement, accuracy, compared, to, when, only, one, isotope, is, measured, this, double, isotope, method, is, also, weakly, sensitive, to, inhomogeneities, in, the, spatial, distribution, of, the, isotopes, and, to, variations, in, their, precipitation, rate, protactinium, is, both, toxic, and, highly, radioactive, thus, it, is, handled, exclusively, in, a, sealed, glove, box, its, major, isotope, 231, pa, has, a, specific, activity, of, 0, 048, curies, 1, 8, gbq, per, gram, and, primarily, emits, alpha, particles, with, an, energy, of, 5, mev, which, can, be, stopped, by, a, thin, layer, of, any, material, however, it, slowly, decays, with, a, half, life, of, 32, 760, years, into, 227, ac, which, has, a, specific, activity, of, 74, curies, 2, 700, gbq, per, gram, emits, both, alpha, and, beta, radiation, and, has, a, much, shorter, half, life, of, 22, years, 227, ac, in, turn, decays, into, lighter, isotopes, with, even, shorter, half, lives, and, much, greater, specific, activities, sa, as, protactinium, is, present, in, small, amounts, in, most, natural, products, and, materials, it, is, ingested, with, food, or, water, and, inhaled, with, air, only, about, 0, 05, of, ingested, protactinium, is, absorbed, into, the, blood, and, the, remainder, is, excreted, from, the, blood, about, 40, of, the, protactinium, deposits, in, the, bones, about, 15, goes, to, the, liver, 2, to, the, kidneys, and, the, rest, leaves, the, body, the, biological, half, life, of, protactinium, is, about, 50, years, in, the, bones, whereas, its, biological, half, life, in, other, organs, has, a, fast, and, slow, component, for, example, 70, of, the, protactinium, in, the, liver, has, a, biological, half, life, of, 10, days, and, the, remaining, 30, for, 60, days, the, corresponding, values, for, kidneys, are, 20, 10, days, and, 80, 60, days, in, each, affected, organ, protactinium, promotes, cancer, via, its, radioactivity, the, maximum, safe, dose, of, pa, in, the, human, body, is, 0, 03, ci, 1, 1, kbq, which, corresponds, to, 0, 5, micrograms, of, 231, pa, the, maximum, allowed, concentrations, of, 231, pa, in, the, air, in, germany, is, 3, 10, 4, bq, m, 3
