according, to, the, international, astronomical, union, iau, a, minor, planet, is, an, astronomical, object, in, direct, orbit, around, the, sun, that, is, exclusively, classified, as, neither, a, planet, nor, a, comet, before, 2006, the, iau, officially, used, the, term, minor, planet, but, that, year, s, meeting, reclassified, minor, planets, and, comets, into, dwarf, planets, and, small, solar, system, bodies, sssbs, in, contrast, to, the, eight, official, planets, of, the, solar, system, all, minor, planets, fail, to, clear, their, orbital, neighborhood, minor, planets, include, asteroids, near, earth, objects, mars, crossers, main, belt, asteroids, and, jupiter, trojans, as, well, as, distant, minor, planets, centaurs, and, trans, neptunian, objects, most, of, which, reside, in, the, kuiper, belt, and, the, scattered, disc, as, of, july, 2024, there, are, 1, 382, 206, known, objects, divided, into, 720, 000, numbered, secured, discoveries, and, 662, 206, unnumbered, minor, planets, with, only, five, of, those, officially, recognized, as, a, dwarf, planet, the, first, minor, planet, to, be, discovered, was, ceres, in, 1801, though, it, was, called, a, planet, at, the, time, and, an, asteroid, soon, after, the, term, minor, planet, was, not, introduced, until, 1841, and, was, considered, a, subcategory, of, planet, until, 1932, the, term, planetoid, has, also, been, used, especially, for, larger, planetary, objects, such, as, those, the, iau, has, called, dwarf, planets, since, 2006, historically, the, terms, asteroid, minor, planet, and, planetoid, have, been, more, or, less, synonymous, this, terminology, has, become, more, complicated, by, the, discovery, of, numerous, minor, planets, beyond, the, orbit, of, jupiter, especially, trans, neptunian, objects, that, are, generally, not, considered, asteroids, a, minor, planet, seen, releasing, gas, may, be, dually, classified, as, a, comet, objects, are, called, dwarf, planets, if, their, own, gravity, is, sufficient, to, achieve, hydrostatic, equilibrium, and, form, an, ellipsoidal, shape, all, other, minor, planets, and, comets, are, called, small, solar, system, bodies, the, iau, stated, that, the, term, minor, planet, may, still, be, used, but, the, term, small, solar, system, body, will, be, preferred, however, for, purposes, of, numbering, and, naming, the, traditional, distinction, between, minor, planet, and, comet, is, still, used, hundreds, of, thousands, of, minor, planets, have, been, discovered, within, the, solar, system, and, thousands, more, are, discovered, each, month, the, minor, planet, center, has, documented, over, 213, million, observations, and, 794, 832, minor, planets, of, which, 541, 128, have, orbits, known, well, enough, to, be, assigned, permanent, official, numbers, of, these, 21, 922, have, official, names, as, of, 8, november, 2021, the, lowest, numbered, unnamed, minor, planet, is, 4596, 1981, qb, and, the, highest, numbered, named, minor, planet, is, 594913, ayl, chaxnim, there, are, various, broad, minor, planet, populations, all, astronomical, bodies, in, the, solar, system, need, a, distinct, designation, the, naming, of, minor, planets, runs, through, a, three, step, process, first, a, provisional, designation, is, given, upon, discovery, because, the, object, still, may, turn, out, to, be, a, false, positive, or, become, lost, later, on, called, a, provisionally, designated, minor, planet, after, the, observation, arc, is, accurate, enough, to, predict, its, future, location, a, minor, planet, is, formally, designated, and, receives, a, number, it, is, then, a, numbered, minor, planet, finally, in, the, third, step, it, may, be, named, by, its, discoverers, however, only, a, small, fraction, of, all, minor, planets, have, been, named, the, vast, majority, are, either, numbered, or, have, still, only, a, provisional, designation, example, of, the, naming, process, a, newly, discovered, minor, planet, is, given, a, provisional, designation, for, example, the, provisional, designation, 2002, at, 4, consists, of, the, year, of, discovery, 2002, and, an, alphanumeric, code, indicating, the, half, month, of, discovery, and, the, sequence, within, that, half, month, once, an, asteroid, s, orbit, has, been, confirmed, it, is, given, a, number, and, later, may, also, be, given, a, name, e, g, 433, eros, the, formal, naming, convention, uses, parentheses, around, the, number, but, dropping, the, parentheses, is, quite, common, informally, it, is, common, to, drop, the, number, altogether, or, to, drop, it, after, the, first, mention, when, a, name, is, repeated, in, running, text, minor, planets, that, have, been, given, a, number, but, not, a, name, keep, their, provisional, designation, e, g, 29075, 1950, da, because, modern, discovery, techniques, are, finding, vast, numbers, of, new, asteroids, they, are, increasingly, being, left, unnamed, the, earliest, discovered, to, be, left, unnamed, was, for, a, long, time, 3360, 1981, va, now, 3360, syrinx, in, november, 2006, its, position, as, the, lowest, numbered, unnamed, asteroid, passed, to, 3708, 1974, fv, 1, now, 3708, socus, and, in, may, 2021, to, 4596, 1981, qb, on, rare, occasions, a, small, object, s, provisional, designation, may, become, used, as, a, name, in, itself, the, then, unnamed, 15760, 1992, qb, 1, gave, its, name, to, a, group, of, objects, that, became, known, as, classical, kuiper, belt, objects, cubewanos, before, it, was, finally, named, 15760, albion, in, january, 2018, a, few, objects, are, cross, listed, as, both, comets, and, asteroids, such, as, 4015, wilson, harrington, which, is, also, listed, as, 107p, wilson, harrington, minor, planets, are, awarded, an, official, number, once, their, orbits, are, confirmed, with, the, increasing, rapidity, of, discovery, these, are, now, six, figure, numbers, the, switch, from, five, figures, to, six, figures, arrived, with, the, publication, of, the, minor, planet, circular, mpc, of, october, 19, 2005, which, saw, the, highest, numbered, minor, planet, jump, from, 99947, to, 118161, the, first, few, asteroids, were, named, after, figures, from, greek, and, roman, mythology, but, as, such, names, started, to, dwindle, the, names, of, famous, people, literary, characters, discoverers, spouses, children, colleagues, and, even, television, characters, were, used, commission, 15, of, the, international, astronomical, union, is, dedicated, to, the, physical, study, of, comets, minor, planets, archival, data, on, the, physical, properties, of, comets, and, minor, planets, are, found, in, the, pds, asteroid, dust, archive, this, includes, standard, asteroid, physical, characteristics, such, as, the, properties, of, binary, systems, occultation, timings, and, diameters, masses, densities, rotation, periods, surface, temperatures, albedoes, spin, vectors, taxonomy, and, absolute, magnitudes, and, slopes, in, addition, european, asteroid, research, node, e, a, r, n, an, association, of, asteroid, research, groups, maintains, a, data, base, of, physical, and, dynamical, properties, of, near, earth, asteroids, environmental, characteristics, have, three, aspects, space, environment, surface, environment, and, internal, environment, including, geological, optical, thermal, and, radiological, environmental, properties, etc, which, are, the, basis, for, understanding, the, basic, properties, of, minor, planets, carrying, out, scientific, research, and, are, also, an, important, reference, basis, for, designing, the, payload, of, exploration, missions, without, the, protection, of, an, atmosphere, and, its, own, strong, magnetic, field, the, minor, planet, s, surface, is, directly, exposed, to, the, surrounding, radiation, environment, in, the, cosmic, space, where, minor, planets, are, located, the, radiation, on, the, surface, of, the, planets, can, be, divided, into, two, categories, according, to, their, sources, one, comes, from, the, sun, including, electromagnetic, radiation, from, the, sun, and, ionizing, radiation, from, the, solar, wind, and, solar, energy, particles, the, other, comes, from, the, sun, outside, the, solar, system, that, is, galactic, cosmic, rays, etc, usually, during, one, rotation, period, of, a, minor, planet, the, albedo, of, a, minor, planet, will, change, slightly, due, to, its, irregular, shape, and, uneven, distribution, of, material, composition, this, small, change, will, be, reflected, in, the, periodic, change, of, the, planet, s, light, curve, which, can, be, observed, by, ground, based, equipment, so, as, to, obtain, the, planet, s, magnitude, rotation, period, rotation, axis, orientation, shape, albedo, distribution, and, scattering, properties, generally, speaking, the, albedo, of, minor, planets, is, usually, low, and, the, overall, statistical, distribution, is, bimodal, corresponding, to, c, type, average, 0, 035, and, s, type, average, 0, 15, minor, planets, in, the, minor, planet, exploration, mission, measuring, the, albedo, and, color, changes, of, the, planet, surface, is, also, the, most, basic, method, to, directly, know, the, difference, in, the, material, composition, of, the, planet, surface, the, geological, environment, on, the, surface, of, minor, planets, is, similar, to, that, of, other, unprotected, celestial, bodies, with, the, most, widespread, geomorphological, feature, present, being, impact, craters, however, the, fact, that, most, minor, planets, are, rubble, pile, structures, which, are, loose, and, porous, gives, the, impact, action, on, the, surface, of, minor, planets, its, unique, characteristics, on, highly, porous, minor, planets, small, impact, events, produce, spatter, blankets, similar, to, common, impact, events, whereas, large, impact, events, are, dominated, by, compaction, and, spatter, blankets, are, difficult, to, form, and, the, longer, the, planets, receive, such, large, impacts, the, greater, the, overall, density, in, addition, statistical, analysis, of, impact, craters, is, an, important, means, of, obtaining, information, on, the, age, of, a, planet, surface, although, the, crater, size, frequency, distribution, csfd, method, of, dating, commonly, used, on, minor, planet, surfaces, does, not, allow, absolute, ages, to, be, obtained, it, can, be, used, to, determine, the, relative, ages, of, different, geological, bodies, for, comparison, in, addition, to, impact, there, are, a, variety, of, other, rich, geological, effects, on, the, surface, of, minor, planets, such, as, mass, wasting, on, slopes, and, impact, crater, walls, large, scale, linear, features, associated, with, graben, and, electrostatic, transport, of, dust, by, analysing, the, various, geological, processes, on, the, surface, of, minor, planets, it, is, possible, to, learn, about, the, possible, internal, activity, at, this, stage, and, some, of, the, key, evolutionary, information, about, the, long, term, interaction, with, the, external, environment, which, may, lead, to, some, indication, of, the, nature, of, the, parent, body, s, origin, many, of, the, larger, planets, are, often, covered, by, a, layer, of, soil, regolith, of, unknown, thickness, compared, to, other, atmosphere, free, bodies, in, the, solar, system, e, g, the, moon, minor, planets, have, weaker, gravity, fields, and, are, less, capable, of, retaining, fine, grained, material, resulting, in, a, somewhat, larger, surface, soil, layer, size, soil, layers, are, inevitably, subject, to, intense, space, weathering, that, alters, their, physical, and, chemical, properties, due, to, direct, exposure, to, the, surrounding, space, environment, in, silicate, rich, soils, the, outer, layers, of, fe, are, reduced, to, nano, phase, fe, np, fe, which, is, the, main, product, of, space, weathering, for, some, small, planets, their, surfaces, are, more, exposed, as, boulders, of, varying, sizes, up, to, 100, metres, in, diameter, due, to, their, weaker, gravitational, pull, these, boulders, are, of, high, scientific, interest, as, they, may, be, either, deeply, buried, material, excavated, by, impact, action, or, fragments, of, the, planet, s, parent, body, that, have, survived, the, rocks, provide, more, direct, and, primitive, information, about, the, material, inside, the, minor, planet, and, the, nature, of, its, parent, body, than, the, soil, layer, and, the, different, colours, and, forms, of, the, rocks, indicate, different, sources, of, material, on, the, surface, of, the, minor, planet, or, different, evolutionary, processes, usually, in, the, interior, of, the, planet, the, convection, of, the, conductive, fluid, will, generate, a, large, and, strong, magnetic, field, however, the, size, of, a, minor, planet, is, generally, small, and, most, of, the, minor, planets, have, a, crushed, stone, pile, structure, and, there, is, basically, no, dynamo, structure, inside, so, it, will, not, generate, a, self, generated, dipole, magnetic, field, like, the, earth, but, some, minor, planets, do, have, magnetic, fields, on, the, one, hand, some, minor, planets, have, remanent, magnetism, if, the, parent, body, had, a, magnetic, field, or, if, the, nearby, planetary, body, has, a, strong, magnetic, field, the, rocks, on, the, parent, body, will, be, magnetised, during, the, cooling, process, and, the, planet, formed, by, the, fission, of, the, parent, body, will, still, retain, remanence, which, can, also, be, detected, in, extraterrestrial, meteorites, from, the, minor, planets, on, the, other, hand, if, the, minor, planets, are, composed, of, electrically, conductive, material, and, their, internal, conductivity, is, similar, to, that, of, carbon, or, iron, bearing, meteorites, the, interaction, between, the, minor, planets, and, the, solar, wind, is, likely, to, be, unipolar, induction, resulting, in, an, external, magnetic, field, for, the, minor, planet, in, addition, the, magnetic, fields, of, minor, planets, are, not, static, impact, events, weathering, in, space, and, changes, in, the, thermal, environment, can, alter, the, existing, magnetic, fields, of, minor, planets, at, present, there, are, not, many, direct, observations, of, minor, planet, magnetic, fields, and, the, few, existing, planets, detection, projects, generally, carry, magnetometers, with, some, targets, such, as, gaspra, and, braille, measured, to, have, strong, magnetic, fields, nearby, while, others, such, as, lutetia, have, no, magnetic, field, solar, system, local, interstellar, cloud, local, bubble, gould, belt, orion, arm, milky, way, milky, way, subgroup, local, group, local, sheet, virgo, supercluster, laniakea, supercluster, local, hole, observable, universe, universe, each, arrow, may, be, read, as, within, or, part, of
