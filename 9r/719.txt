soil, fertility, refers, to, the, ability, of, soil, to, sustain, agricultural, plant, growth, i, e, to, provide, plant, habitat, and, result, in, sustained, and, consistent, yields, of, high, quality, it, also, refers, to, the, soil, s, ability, to, supply, plant, crop, nutrients, in, the, right, quantities, and, qualities, over, a, sustained, period, of, time, a, fertile, soil, has, the, following, properties, the, following, properties, contribute, to, soil, fertility, in, most, situations, in, lands, used, for, agriculture, and, other, human, activities, maintenance, of, soil, fertility, typically, requires, the, use, of, soil, conservation, practices, this, is, because, soil, erosion, and, other, forms, of, soil, degradation, generally, result, in, a, decline, in, quality, with, respect, to, one, or, more, of, the, aspects, indicated, above, soil, fertility, and, quality, of, land, have, been, impacted, by, the, effects, of, colonialism, and, slavery, both, in, the, u, s, and, globally, the, introduction, of, harmful, land, practices, such, as, intensive, and, non, prescribed, burnings, and, deforestation, by, colonists, create, long, lasting, negative, results, to, the, environment, the, institution, of, slavery, reproduced, distress, to, the, natural, world, and, crop, production, soil, fertility, and, depletion, have, different, origins, and, consequences, in, various, parts, of, the, world, the, intentional, creation, of, dark, earth, in, the, amazon, promotes, the, important, relationship, between, indigenous, communities, and, their, land, in, african, and, middle, eastern, regions, humans, and, the, environment, are, also, altered, due, to, soil, depletion, bioavailable, phosphorus, available, to, soil, life, is, the, element, in, soil, that, is, most, often, lacking, nitrogen, and, potassium, are, also, needed, in, substantial, amounts, for, this, reason, these, three, elements, are, always, identified, on, a, commercial, fertilizer, analysis, for, example, a, 10, 10, 15, fertilizer, has, 10, percent, nitrogen, 10, percent, available, phosphorus, p, 2, o, 5, and, 15, percent, water, soluble, potassium, k, 2, o, sulfur, is, the, fourth, element, that, may, be, identified, in, a, commercial, analysis, e, g, 21, 0, 0, 24, which, would, contain, 21, nitrogen, and, 24, sulfate, inorganic, fertilizers, are, generally, less, expensive, and, have, higher, concentrations, of, nutrients, than, organic, fertilizers, also, since, nitrogen, phosphorus, and, potassium, generally, must, be, in, the, inorganic, forms, to, be, taken, up, by, plants, inorganic, fertilizers, are, generally, immediately, bioavailable, to, plants, without, modification, however, studies, suggest, that, chemical, fertilizers, have, adverse, health, impacts, on, humans, including, the, development, of, chronic, disease, from, the, toxins, as, for, the, environment, over, reliance, on, inorganic, fertilizers, disrupts, the, natural, nutrient, balance, in, the, soil, resulting, in, lower, soil, quality, loss, of, organic, matter, and, higher, chances, for, erosion, in, the, soil, additionally, the, water, soluble, nitrogen, in, inorganic, fertilizers, does, not, provide, for, the, long, term, needs, of, the, plant, and, creates, water, pollution, slow, release, fertilizers, may, reduce, leaching, loss, of, nutrients, and, may, make, the, nutrients, that, they, provide, available, over, a, longer, period, of, time, soil, fertility, is, a, complex, process, that, involves, the, constant, cycling, of, nutrients, between, organic, and, inorganic, forms, as, plant, material, and, animal, wastes, are, decomposed, by, micro, organisms, they, release, inorganic, nutrients, to, the, soil, solution, a, process, referred, to, as, mineralization, those, nutrients, may, then, undergo, further, transformations, which, may, be, aided, or, enabled, by, soil, micro, organisms, like, plants, many, micro, organisms, require, or, preferentially, use, inorganic, forms, of, nitrogen, phosphorus, or, potassium, and, will, compete, with, plants, for, these, nutrients, tying, up, the, nutrients, in, microbial, biomass, a, process, often, called, immobilization, the, balance, between, immobilization, and, mineralization, processes, depends, on, the, balance, and, availability, of, major, nutrients, and, organic, carbon, to, soil, microorganisms, natural, processes, such, as, lightning, strikes, may, fix, atmospheric, nitrogen, by, converting, it, to, no, 2, denitrification, may, occur, under, anaerobic, conditions, flooding, in, the, presence, of, denitrifying, bacteria, nutrient, cations, including, potassium, and, many, micronutrients, are, held, in, relatively, strong, bonds, with, the, negatively, charged, portions, of, the, soil, in, a, process, known, as, cation, exchange, phosphorus, is, a, primary, factor, of, soil, fertility, as, it, is, an, element, of, plant, nutrients, in, the, soil, it, is, essential, for, cell, division, and, plant, development, especially, in, seedlings, and, young, plants, however, phosphorus, is, becoming, increasingly, harder, to, find, and, its, reserves, are, starting, to, be, depleted, due, to, the, excessive, use, as, a, fertilizer, the, widespread, use, of, phosphorus, in, fertilizers, has, led, to, pollution, and, eutrophication, recently, the, term, peak, phosphorus, has, been, coined, due, to, the, limited, occurrence, of, rock, phosphate, in, the, world, a, wide, variety, of, materials, have, been, described, as, soil, conditioners, due, to, their, ability, to, improve, soil, quality, including, biochar, offering, multiple, soil, health, benefits, food, waste, compost, was, found, to, have, better, soil, improvement, than, manure, based, compost, photosynthesis, is, the, process, whereby, plants, use, light, energy, to, drive, chemical, reactions, which, convert, co, 2, into, sugars, as, such, all, plants, require, access, to, both, light, and, carbon, dioxide, to, produce, energy, grow, and, reproduce, while, typically, limited, by, nitrogen, phosphorus, and, potassium, low, levels, of, carbon, dioxide, can, also, act, as, a, limiting, factor, on, plant, growth, peer, reviewed, and, published, scientific, studies, have, shown, that, increasing, co, 2, is, highly, effective, at, promoting, plant, growth, up, to, levels, over, 300, ppm, further, increases, in, co, 2, can, to, a, very, small, degree, continue, to, increase, net, photosynthetic, output, soil, depletion, occurs, when, the, components, which, contribute, to, fertility, are, removed, and, not, replaced, and, the, conditions, which, support, soil, s, fertility, are, not, maintained, this, leads, to, poor, crop, yields, in, agriculture, depletion, can, be, due, to, excessively, intense, cultivation, and, inadequate, soil, management, depletion, may, occur, through, a, variety, of, other, effects, including, overtillage, which, damages, soil, structure, underuse, of, nutrient, inputs, which, leads, to, mining, of, the, soil, nutrient, bank, and, salinization, of, soil, soil, fertility, can, be, severely, challenged, when, land, use, changes, rapidly, for, example, in, colonial, new, england, colonists, made, a, number, of, decisions, that, depleted, the, soils, including, allowing, herd, animals, to, wander, freely, not, replenishing, soils, with, manure, and, a, sequence, of, events, that, led, to, erosion, william, cronon, wrote, that, the, long, term, effect, was, to, put, those, soils, in, jeopardy, the, removal, of, the, forest, the, increase, in, destructive, floods, the, soil, compaction, and, close, cropping, wrought, by, grazing, animals, ploughing, all, served, to, increase, erosion, cronon, continues, explaining, where, mowing, was, unnecessary, and, grazing, among, living, trees, was, possible, settlers, saved, labor, by, simply, burning, the, forest, undergrowth, and, turning, loose, their, cattle, in, at, least, one, ill, favored, area, the, inhabitants, of, neighboring, towns, burned, so, frequently, and, graze, so, intensively, that, the, timber, was, greatly, injured, and, the, land, became, hard, to, subdue, in, the, long, run, cattle, tended, to, encourage, the, growth, of, woody, thorn, bearing, plants, which, they, could, not, eat, and, which, once, established, were, very, difficult, to, remove, these, practices, were, methods, of, simplifying, labor, for, colonial, settlers, in, new, lands, when, they, were, not, familiar, with, traditional, indigenous, agricultural, methods, those, indigenous, communities, were, not, consulted, but, rather, forced, out, of, their, homelands, so, european, settlers, could, commodify, their, resources, this, introduction, of, thorn, bearing, plants, turning, loose, cattle, and, intensive, burning, of, land, ruined, soil, fertility, and, prohibited, sustainable, crop, growth, while, colonists, utilized, fire, to, clear, land, certain, prescribed, burning, practices, are, common, and, valuable, to, increase, biodiversity, and, in, turn, benefit, soil, fertility, without, consideration, of, the, intensity, seasonality, and, frequency, of, the, burns, the, conservation, of, biodiversity, and, the, overall, health, of, the, soil, can, be, negatively, impacted, by, fire, prescribed, burning, is, used, in, many, cultural, rituals, as, a, vital, spiritual, and, ecological, practice, the, karuk, tribe, of, contemporary, california, represent, one, community, where, this, is, utilized, the, karuk, tribe, live, in, the, klamath, river, basin, and, their, cultural, burning, methods, have, been, actively, suppressed, by, the, usfs, united, states, forest, service, a, study, by, sociologist, kirsten, vineyta, analyzes, how, the, usfs, deployed, anti, indigenous, rhetoric, to, justify, its, own, unsubstantiated, forest, management, agenda, usfs, leadership, racialized, light, burning, by, deridingly, referring, to, it, as, piute, forestry, the, agency, has, also, discredited, downplayed, and, erased, indigenous, peoples, and, knowledges, in, ways, that, invoke, tropes, of, the, indian, savage, the, vanishing, indian, and, the, concept, of, terra, nullius, in, the, 1960s, the, civil, rights, and, american, indian, movements, began, to, take, flight, changing, public, and, government, sentiments, on, these, century, long, practices, after, years, of, colonial, oppression, at, the, hands, of, the, united, states, against, the, karuk, tribe, the, usfs, started, to, reconsider, the, impact, of, these, prescribed, burnings, the, usfs, has, since, reversed, its, stance, on, the, ecological, role, of, fire, to, further, support, prescribed, fire, as, a, management, tool, in, addition, to, soil, erosion, through, using, too, much, or, too, little, fire, colonial, agriculture, also, resulted, in, topsoil, depletion, topsoil, depletion, occurs, when, the, nutrient, rich, organic, topsoil, which, takes, hundreds, to, thousands, of, years, to, build, up, under, natural, conditions, is, eroded, or, depleted, of, its, original, organic, material, the, dust, bowl, in, the, southern, united, states, as, reinterpreted, from, its, mainstream, analysis, by, sociologist, hannah, holleman, is, an, example, of, one, dramatic, regional, manifestation, of, a, global, socio, ecological, crisis, generated, by, the, realities, of, settler, colonialism, and, imperialism, beginning, with, a, period, of, new, imperialism, starting, in, the, 1870s, conditions, of, economic, expansion, were, emphasized, globally, and, were, demonstrated, through, policies, such, as, increased, seizure, of, indigenous, lands, economic, expansion, is, supported, by, the, commodification, of, natural, resources, and, the, globalization, of, the, ecological, rift, settler, colonialists, found, they, were, able, to, profit, from, the, divide, in, the, relationship, between, humanity, and, nature, since, it, is, irreparable, within, capitalist, society, these, theories, and, policies, of, ecological, degradation, and, social, domination, shaped, global, farming, practices, as, a, result, agricultural, regions, were, impacted, including, specifically, argued, by, holleman, the, u, s, southern, plains, dust, bowl, due, to, the, soil, erosion, crisis, that, developed, in, the, 1930s, the, need, to, produce, agricultural, commodities, represented, in, colonial, and, dustbowl, soil, depletion, has, its, roots, according, to, karl, marx, in, capitalism, in, 1867, marx, wrote, of, the, role, of, capitalism, in, soil, depletion, describing, how, all, progress, in, capitalistic, agriculture, is, a, progress, in, the, art, not, only, of, robbing, the, worker, but, of, robbing, the, soil, all, progress, in, increasing, the, fertility, of, the, soil, for, a, given, time, is, a, progress, towards, ruining, the, lasting, sources, of, that, fertility, the, sacred, relationship, between, black, people, and, the, soil, can, be, traced, back, to, cleopatra, s, reign, in, egypt, in, 51, bce, according, to, farmer, leah, penniman, in, egypt, earthworms, of, the, nile, river, valley, contributed, to, the, significant, fertility, of, the, soils, as, a, result, cleopatra, declared, the, earthworm, and, sacred, animal, to, recognize, the, animal, s, positive, impact, no, one, including, farmers, was, allowed, to, harm, or, remove, an, earthworm, for, fear, of, offending, the, deity, of, fertility, today, that, soil, human, relationship, is, maintained, and, in, west, african, communities, the, depth, of, highly, fertile, anthropogenic, soils, serves, as, a, meter, stick, for, the, age, of, communities, in, ghana, and, liberia, it, is, a, long, withstanding, practice, to, combine, different, types, of, waste, to, create, fertile, soil, this, black, gold, as, it, s, known, contains, high, concentrations, of, calcium, phosphorus, and, carbon, however, when, african, communities, were, removed, from, their, homelands, during, periods, of, enslavement, it, s, known, that, the, further, the, population, gets, from, its, connection, to, earth, the, more, likely, we, are, to, ignore, and, exploit, those, who, work, the, soil, enslavement, of, black, people, particularly, in, the, united, states, had, a, negative, impact, on, the, relationship, between, those, people, and, the, land, as, well, as, the, soil, health, as, wendell, berry, described, in, the, hidden, wound, the, white, man, preoccupied, with, the, abstractions, of, the, economic, exploitation, and, ownership, of, the, land, necessarily, has, lived, in, the, country, as, a, destructive, force, an, ecological, catastrophe, because, he, assigned, the, hand, labor, and, in, that, the, possibility, of, intimate, knowledge, of, the, land, to, a, people, he, considered, racially, inferior, in, this, debasing, labor, he, destroyed, the, possibility, of, meaningful, contact, with, the, earth, he, was, literally, blinded, by, his, presuppositions, and, prejudices, because, he, did, not, know, the, land, it, was, inevitable, that, he, would, squander, its, natural, bounty, deplete, its, richness, corrupt, and, pollute, it, or, destroy, it, altogether, the, history, of, the, white, man, s, use, of, the, earth, in, america, is, a, scandal, as, historian, david, silkenat, explains, the, goals, of, southern, plantation, and, slave, owners, instead, of, measuring, productivity, based, on, outputs, per, acre, were, to, maximize, the, amount, of, labor, that, could, be, extracted, from, the, enslaved, workforce, the, landscape, was, seen, as, disposable, and, the, african, slaves, were, seen, as, expendable, once, these, southern, farmers, forced, slaves, to, leach, soils, and, engage, in, mass, deforestation, they, would, discard, the, land, and, move, towards, more, fertile, prospects, the, forced, slave, practices, created, extensive, destruction, on, the, land, the, environmental, impact, included, draining, swamps, clearing, forests, for, monocropping, and, fuel, steamships, and, introducing, invasive, species, all, leading, to, fragile, ecosystems, in, the, aftermath, these, ecosystems, left, hillsides, eroded, rivers, clogged, with, sterile, soil, and, extinction, of, native, species, silkenat, summarizes, this, phenomenon, of, the, relationship, between, enslavement, and, soil, although, typically, treated, separately, slavery, and, the, environment, naturally, intersect, in, complex, and, powerful, ways, leaving, lasting, effects, from, the, period, of, emancipation, through, modern, day, reckonings, with, racial, justice, the, land, too, fell, victim, to, the, slave, owner, s, lash, the, details, of, indigenous, societies, prior, to, european, colonization, in, 1492, within, the, amazonian, regions, of, south, america, particularly, the, size, of, the, communities, and, the, depth, of, interactions, with, the, environment, are, continually, debated, central, to, the, debate, is, the, influence, of, dark, earth, dark, earth, is, a, type, of, soil, found, in, the, amazon, that, has, a, darker, color, higher, organic, carbon, content, and, higher, fertility, than, soil, in, other, regions, of, south, america, which, makes, it, highly, coveted, even, today, dark, earth, deposits, have, been, found, through, ethnographic, and, archaeological, studies, to, have, been, created, through, ancient, indigenous, practices, by, intentional, soil, management, ethnoarchaeologist, morgan, schmidt, outlines, how, this, carbon, rich, soil, was, intentionally, created, by, communities, in, the, amazon, while, dark, earth, and, other, anthropic, soils, can, be, found, all, throughout, the, world, amazonian, dark, earth, is, particularly, significant, because, it, contrasts, too, sharply, with, the, especially, poor, fertility, of, typical, highly, weathered, tropical, upland, soils, in, the, amazon, there, is, much, evidence, to, suggest, that, the, development, of, ancient, agricultural, societies, in, the, amazon, was, strongly, influenced, by, the, formation, of, dark, earth, as, a, result, amazonian, societies, benefitted, from, the, dark, earth, in, terms, of, agricultural, success, and, enhanced, food, production, soil, analyses, have, been, completed, on, the, modern, and, ancient, kuikuro, indigenous, territory, in, the, upper, xingu, river, basin, in, southeastern, amazonia, through, archaeological, and, ethnographic, research, to, determine, the, human, relation, to, the, soil, the, results, demonstrate, the, intentional, creation, of, dark, earth, highlighting, how, indigenous, knowledge, can, provide, strategies, for, sustainable, rainforest, management, and, carbon, sequestration, dark, earth, and, other, tropical, soils, are, the, second, largest, potential, source, of, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, after, fossil, fuels, these, dark, earths, could, be, a, substantial, carbon, reservoir, that, has, not, been, considered, when, incorporated, into, land, management, practices, dark, earths, can, be, carbon, sinks, meaning, that, they, absorb, more, carbon, from, the, atmosphere, than, they, release, and, are, an, essential, part, of, combatting, climate, change, research, has, shown, hundreds, to, thousands, of, tons, of, carbon, and, nutrients, stored, in, the, dark, earth, in, those, regions, of, the, amazon, which, confirms, the, implications, of, utilizing, the, soil, for, carbon, sequestration, when, carbon, dioxide, is, captured, and, stored, in, the, atmosphere, and, is, a, method, associated, with, reducing, the, amount, of, co, 2, in, the, environment, which, in, turn, aids, in, the, reduction, of, climate, change, through, its, formation, one, of, the, most, widespread, occurrences, of, soil, depletion, as, of, 2008, is, in, tropical, zones, where, nutrient, content, of, soils, is, low, the, depletion, of, soil, has, affected, the, state, of, plant, life, and, crops, in, agriculture, in, many, countries, in, the, middle, east, for, example, many, countries, find, it, difficult, to, grow, produce, because, of, droughts, lack, of, soil, and, lack, of, irrigation, the, middle, east, has, three, countries, that, indicate, a, decline, in, crop, production, the, highest, rates, of, productivity, decline, are, found, in, hilly, and, dryland, areas, many, countries, in, africa, also, undergo, a, depletion, of, fertile, soil, in, regions, of, dry, climate, like, sudan, and, the, countries, that, make, up, the, sahara, desert, droughts, and, soil, degradation, is, common, cash, crops, such, as, teas, maize, and, beans, require, a, variety, of, nutrients, in, order, to, grow, healthy, soil, fertility, has, declined, in, the, farming, regions, of, africa, and, the, use, of, artificial, and, natural, fertilizers, has, been, used, to, regain, the, nutrients, of, ground, soil, albert, howard, is, credited, as, the, first, westerner, to, publish, native, techniques, of, sustainable, agriculture, as, noted, by, howard, in, 1944, in, all, future, studies, of, disease, we, must, therefore, always, begin, with, the, soil, this, must, be, gotten, into, good, condition, first, of, all, and, then, the, reaction, of, the, soil, the, plant, animal, and, man, observed, many, diseases, will, then, automatically, disappear, soil, fertility, is, the, basis, of, the, public, health, system, of, the, future, howard, connects, the, health, crises, of, crops, to, the, impacts, of, livestock, and, human, health, ultimately, spreading, the, message, that, humans, must, respect, and, restore, the, soil, for, the, benefit, of, the, human, and, non, human, world, he, continues, that, industrial, agriculture, disrupts, the, delicate, balance, of, nature, and, irrevocably, robs, the, soil, of, its, fertility, soil, has, been, known, to, have, positive, mental, health, effects, as, well, the, exposure, to, microbiomes, in, quality, soil, aids, human, depression, specifically, a, study, by, scientist, christopher, lowry, treated, mice, with, the, bacteria, mycobacterium, vaccae, which, is, found, in, the, soil, on, the, shores, of, lake, kyoga, in, uganda, lowry, has, studied, this, bacteria, s, impact, on, the, brain, since, 2001, the, brains, of, these, mice, produced, more, serotonin, known, as, the, mood, regulating, hormone, and, increased, levels, are, known, to, help, with, depression, many, community, organizations, work, to, reconnect, humans, with, the, soil, bring, people, together, based, on, a, shared, passion, and, strengthen, autonomy, and, power, for, individuals, for, example, one, community, based, organization, in, portland, oregon, black, futures, farm, strives, to, rebuild, the, relationship, between, humans, and, the, soil, community, programs, and, outreach, coordinator, for, black, futures, farm, nia, harris, describes, the, goal, to, be, to, heal, the, connection, between, black, people, and, the, land, we, achieve, this, by, cultivating, a, healthy, place, for, the, black, community, to, gather, in, joy, in, a, state, where, we, re, so, beaten, down, by, so, many, factors, that, have, to, do, with, identity, and, politics, and, just, pure, hatred, and, greed, to, have, a, space, that, s, literally, a, sanctuary, for, so, many, people, not, just, those, of, us, who, work, here, but, our, community, that, s, what, makes, it, so, special, the, farm, has, programming, for, people, to, engage, in, healing, meditative, and, artistic, wellness, practices, all, of, the, produce, grown, on, the, farm, is, distributed, to, black, individuals, who, do, not, have, healthy, food, readily, accessible, to, them, the, black, food, sovereignty, coalition, which, the, black, futures, farm, is, part, of, has, a, similar, mission, to, create, events, and, spaces, in, which, black, and, brown, communities, are, liberated, through, community, building, practices, and, food, sovereignty, according, to, the, co, founders, malcolm, hoover, and, mirabai, collins, farming, is, an, act, of, resistance, against, the, disconnection, between, black, people, and, the, land, irrigation, is, a, process, by, which, crops, are, watered, by, man, made, means, such, as, bringing, in, water, from, pipes, canals, or, sprinklers, irrigation, is, used, when, the, natural, rainfall, patterns, of, a, region, are, not, sustainable, enough, to, maintain, crops, ancient, civilizations, heavily, relied, on, irrigation, and, today, about, 18, of, the, world, s, cropland, is, irrigated, mainly, in, asia, africa, and, south, america, the, quality, of, irrigation, water, is, very, important, to, maintain, soil, fertility, and, tilth, and, for, using, more, soil, depth, by, the, plants, when, soil, is, irrigated, with, high, alkaline, water, unwanted, sodium, salts, build, up, in, the, soil, which, would, make, soil, draining, capacity, very, poor, so, plant, roots, can, not, penetrate, deep, into, the, soil, for, optimum, growth, in, alkali, soils, when, soil, is, irrigated, with, low, ph, acidic, water, the, useful, salts, ca, mg, k, p, s, etc, are, removed, by, draining, water, from, the, acidic, soil, and, in, addition, unwanted, aluminium, and, manganese, salts, to, the, plants, are, dissolved, from, the, soil, impeding, plant, growth, when, soil, is, irrigated, with, high, salinity, water, or, sufficient, water, is, not, draining, out, from, the, irrigated, soil, the, soil, would, convert, into, saline, soil, or, lose, its, fertility, saline, water, enhance, the, turgor, pressure, or, osmotic, pressure, requirement, which, impedes, the, off, take, of, water, and, nutrients, by, the, plant, roots, top, soil, loss, takes, place, in, alkali, soils, due, to, erosion, by, rain, water, surface, flows, or, drainage, as, they, form, colloids, fine, mud, in, contact, with, water, plants, absorb, water, soluble, inorganic, salts, only, from, the, soil, for, their, growth, soil, as, such, does, not, lose, fertility, just, by, growing, crops, but, it, lose, its, fertility, due, to, accumulation, of, unwanted, and, depletion, of, wanted, inorganic, salts, from, the, soil, by, improper, irrigation, and, acid, rain, water, quantity, and, quality, of, water, the, fertility, of, many, soils, which, are, not, suitable, for, plant, growth, can, be, enhanced, many, times, gradually, by, providing, adequate, irrigation, water, of, suitable, quality, and, good, drainage, from, the, soil
