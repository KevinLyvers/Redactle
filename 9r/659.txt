in, geology, hotspots, or, hot, spots, are, volcanic, locales, thought, to, be, fed, by, underlying, mantle, that, is, anomalously, hot, compared, with, the, surrounding, mantle, examples, include, the, hawaii, iceland, and, yellowstone, hotspots, a, hotspot, s, position, on, the, earth, s, surface, is, independent, of, tectonic, plate, boundaries, and, so, hotspots, may, create, a, chain, of, volcanoes, as, the, plates, move, above, them, there, are, two, hypotheses, that, attempt, to, explain, their, origins, one, suggests, that, hotspots, are, due, to, mantle, plumes, that, rise, as, thermal, diapirs, from, the, core, mantle, boundary, the, alternative, plate, theory, is, that, the, mantle, source, beneath, a, hotspot, is, not, anomalously, hot, rather, the, crust, above, is, unusually, weak, or, thin, so, that, lithospheric, extension, permits, the, passive, rising, of, melt, from, shallow, depths, the, origins, of, the, concept, of, hotspots, lie, in, the, work, of, j, tuzo, wilson, who, postulated, in, 1963, that, the, formation, of, the, hawaiian, islands, resulted, from, the, slow, movement, of, a, tectonic, plate, across, a, hot, region, beneath, the, surface, it, was, later, postulated, that, hotspots, are, fed, by, streams, of, hot, mantle, rising, from, the, earth, s, core, mantle, boundary, in, a, structure, called, a, mantle, plume, whether, or, not, such, mantle, plumes, exist, has, been, the, subject, of, a, major, controversy, in, earth, science, but, seismic, images, consistent, with, evolving, theory, now, exist, at, any, place, where, volcanism, is, not, linked, to, a, constructive, or, destructive, plate, margin, the, concept, of, a, hotspot, has, been, used, to, explain, its, origin, a, review, article, by, courtillot, et, al, listing, possible, hotspots, makes, a, distinction, between, primary, hotspots, coming, from, deep, within, the, mantle, and, secondary, hotspots, derived, from, mantle, plumes, the, primary, hotspots, originate, from, the, core, mantle, boundary, and, create, large, volcanic, provinces, with, linear, tracks, easter, island, iceland, hawaii, afar, louisville, reunion, and, tristan, confirmed, galapagos, kerguelen, and, marquersas, likely, the, secondary, hotspots, originate, at, the, upper, lower, mantle, boundary, and, do, not, form, large, volcanic, provinces, but, island, chains, samoa, tahiti, cook, pitcairn, caroline, macdonald, confirmed, with, up, to, 20, or, so, more, possible, other, potential, hotspots, are, the, result, of, shallow, mantle, material, surfacing, in, areas, of, lithospheric, break, up, caused, by, tension, and, are, thus, a, very, different, type, of, volcanism, estimates, for, the, number, of, hotspots, postulated, to, be, fed, by, mantle, plumes, have, ranged, from, about, 20, to, several, thousand, with, most, geologists, considering, a, few, tens, to, exist, hawaii, r, union, yellowstone, gal, pagos, and, iceland, are, some, of, the, most, active, volcanic, regions, to, which, the, hypothesis, is, applied, the, plumes, imaged, to, date, vary, widely, in, width, and, other, characteristics, and, are, tilted, being, not, the, simple, relatively, narrow, and, purely, thermal, plumes, many, expected, only, one, yellowstone, has, as, yet, been, consistently, modelled, and, imaged, from, deep, mantle, to, surface, most, hotspot, volcanoes, are, basaltic, e, g, hawaii, tahiti, as, a, result, they, are, less, explosive, than, subduction, zone, volcanoes, in, which, water, is, trapped, under, the, overriding, plate, where, hotspots, occur, in, continental, regions, basaltic, magma, rises, through, the, continental, crust, which, melts, to, form, rhyolites, these, rhyolites, can, form, violent, eruptions, for, example, the, yellowstone, caldera, was, formed, by, some, of, the, most, powerful, volcanic, explosions, in, geologic, history, however, when, the, rhyolite, is, completely, erupted, it, may, be, followed, by, eruptions, of, basaltic, magma, rising, through, the, same, lithospheric, fissures, cracks, in, the, lithosphere, an, example, of, this, activity, is, the, ilgachuz, range, in, british, columbia, which, was, created, by, an, early, complex, series, of, trachyte, and, rhyolite, eruptions, and, late, extrusion, of, a, sequence, of, basaltic, lava, flows, the, hotspot, hypothesis, is, now, closely, linked, to, the, mantle, plume, hypothesis, the, detailed, compositional, studies, now, possible, on, hotspot, basalts, have, allowed, linkage, of, samples, over, the, wider, areas, often, implicate, in, the, later, hypothesis, and, it, s, seismic, imaging, developments, hotspot, volcanoes, are, considered, to, have, a, fundamentally, different, origin, from, island, arc, volcanoes, the, latter, form, over, subduction, zones, at, converging, plate, boundaries, when, one, oceanic, plate, meets, another, the, denser, plate, is, forced, downward, into, a, deep, ocean, trench, this, plate, as, it, is, subducted, releases, water, into, the, base, of, the, over, riding, plate, and, this, water, mixes, with, the, rock, thus, changing, its, composition, causing, some, rock, to, melt, and, rise, it, is, this, that, fuels, a, chain, of, volcanoes, such, as, the, aleutian, islands, near, alaska, the, joint, mantle, plume, hotspot, hypothesis, originally, envisaged, the, feeder, structures, to, be, fixed, relative, to, one, another, with, the, continents, and, seafloor, drifting, overhead, the, hypothesis, thus, predicts, that, time, progressive, chains, of, volcanoes, are, developed, on, the, surface, examples, are, yellowstone, which, lies, at, the, end, of, a, chain, of, extinct, calderas, which, become, progressively, older, to, the, west, another, example, is, the, hawaiian, archipelago, where, islands, become, progressively, older, and, more, deeply, eroded, to, the, northwest, geologists, have, tried, to, use, hotspot, volcanic, chains, to, track, the, movement, of, the, earth, s, tectonic, plates, this, effort, has, been, vexed, by, the, lack, of, very, long, chains, by, the, fact, that, many, are, not, time, progressive, e, g, the, gal, pagos, and, by, the, fact, that, hotspots, do, not, appear, to, be, fixed, relative, to, one, another, e, g, hawaii, and, iceland, that, mantle, plumes, are, much, more, complex, than, originally, hypothesised, and, move, independently, of, each, other, and, plates, is, now, used, to, explain, such, observations, in, 2020, wei, et, al, used, seismic, tomography, to, detect, the, oceanic, plateau, formed, about, 100, million, years, ago, by, the, hypothesized, mantle, plume, head, of, the, hawaii, emperor, seamount, chain, now, subducted, to, a, depth, of, 800, km, under,
