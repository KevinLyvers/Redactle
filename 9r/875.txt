crystallography, is, the, branch, of, science, devoted, to, the, study, of, molecular, and, crystalline, structure, and, properties, the, word, crystallography, is, derived, from, the, ancient, greek, word, kr, stallos, clear, ice, rock, crystal, and, gr, phein, to, write, in, july, 2012, the, united, nations, recognised, the, importance, of, the, science, of, crystallography, by, proclaiming, 2014, the, international, year, of, crystallography, crystallography, is, a, broad, topic, and, many, of, its, subareas, such, as, x, ray, crystallography, are, themselves, important, scientific, topics, crystallography, ranges, from, the, fundamentals, of, crystal, structure, to, the, mathematics, of, crystal, geometry, including, those, that, are, not, periodic, or, quasicrystals, at, the, atomic, scale, it, can, involve, the, use, of, x, ray, diffraction, to, produce, experimental, data, that, the, tools, of, x, ray, crystallography, can, convert, into, detailed, positions, of, atoms, and, sometimes, electron, density, at, larger, scales, it, includes, experimental, tools, such, as, orientational, imaging, to, examine, the, relative, orientations, at, the, grain, boundary, in, materials, crystallography, plays, a, key, role, in, many, areas, of, biology, chemistry, and, physics, as, well, new, developments, in, these, fields, before, the, 20th, century, the, study, of, crystals, was, based, on, physical, measurements, of, their, geometry, using, a, goniometer, this, involved, measuring, the, angles, of, crystal, faces, relative, to, each, other, and, to, theoretical, reference, axes, crystallographic, axes, and, establishing, the, symmetry, of, the, crystal, in, question, the, position, in, 3d, space, of, each, crystal, face, is, plotted, on, a, stereographic, net, such, as, a, wulff, net, or, lambert, net, the, pole, to, each, face, is, plotted, on, the, net, each, point, is, labelled, with, its, miller, index, the, final, plot, allows, the, symmetry, of, the, crystal, to, be, established, the, discovery, of, x, rays, and, electrons, in, the, last, decade, of, the, 19th, century, enabled, the, determination, of, crystal, structures, on, the, atomic, scale, which, brought, about, the, modern, era, of, crystallography, the, first, x, ray, diffraction, experiment, was, conducted, in, 1912, by, max, von, laue, while, electron, diffraction, was, first, realized, in, 1927, in, the, davisson, germer, experiment, and, parallel, work, by, george, paget, thomson, and, alexander, reid, these, developed, into, the, two, main, branches, of, crystallography, x, ray, crystallography, and, electron, diffraction, the, quality, and, throughput, of, solving, crystal, structures, greatly, improved, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, with, the, developments, of, customized, instruments, and, phasing, algorithms, nowadays, crystallography, is, an, interdisciplinary, field, supporting, theoretical, and, experimental, discoveries, in, various, domains, modern, day, scientific, instruments, for, crystallography, vary, from, laboratory, sized, equipment, such, as, diffractometers, and, electron, microscopes, to, dedicated, large, facilities, such, as, photoinjectors, synchrotron, light, sources, and, free, electron, lasers, crystallographic, methods, depend, mainly, on, analysis, of, the, diffraction, patterns, of, a, sample, targeted, by, a, beam, of, some, type, x, rays, are, most, commonly, used, other, beams, used, include, electrons, or, neutrons, crystallographers, often, explicitly, state, the, type, of, beam, used, as, in, the, terms, x, ray, diffraction, neutron, diffraction, and, electron, diffraction, these, three, types, of, radiation, interact, with, the, specimen, in, different, ways, it, is, hard, to, focus, x, rays, or, neutrons, but, since, electrons, are, charged, they, can, be, focused, and, are, used, in, electron, microscope, to, produce, magnified, images, there, are, many, ways, that, transmission, electron, microscopy, and, related, techniques, such, as, scanning, transmission, electron, microscopy, high, resolution, electron, microscopy, can, be, used, to, obtain, images, with, in, many, cases, atomic, resolution, from, which, crystallographic, information, can, be, obtained, there, are, also, other, methods, such, as, low, energy, electron, diffraction, low, energy, electron, microscopy, and, reflection, high, energy, electron, diffraction, which, can, be, used, to, obtain, crystallographic, information, about, surfaces, crystallography, is, used, by, materials, scientists, to, characterize, different, materials, in, single, crystals, the, effects, of, the, crystalline, arrangement, of, atoms, is, often, easy, to, see, macroscopically, because, the, natural, shapes, of, crystals, reflect, the, atomic, structure, in, addition, physical, properties, are, often, controlled, by, crystalline, defects, the, understanding, of, crystal, structures, is, an, important, prerequisite, for, understanding, crystallographic, defects, most, materials, do, not, occur, as, a, single, crystal, but, are, poly, crystalline, in, nature, they, exist, as, an, aggregate, of, small, crystals, with, different, orientations, as, such, powder, diffraction, techniques, which, take, diffraction, patterns, of, samples, with, a, large, number, of, crystals, play, an, important, role, in, structural, determination, other, physical, properties, are, also, linked, to, crystallography, for, example, the, minerals, in, clay, form, small, flat, platelike, structures, clay, can, be, easily, deformed, because, the, platelike, particles, can, slip, along, each, other, in, the, plane, of, the, plates, yet, remain, strongly, connected, in, the, direction, perpendicular, to, the, plates, such, mechanisms, can, be, studied, by, crystallographic, texture, measurements, crystallographic, studies, help, elucidate, the, relationship, between, a, material, s, structure, and, its, properties, aiding, in, developing, new, materials, with, tailored, characteristics, this, understanding, is, crucial, in, various, fields, including, metallurgy, geology, and, materials, science, advancements, in, crystallographic, techniques, such, as, electron, diffraction, and, x, ray, crystallography, continue, to, expand, our, understanding, of, material, behavior, at, the, atomic, level, in, another, example, iron, transforms, from, a, body, centered, cubic, bcc, structure, called, ferrite, to, a, face, centered, cubic, fcc, structure, called, austenite, when, it, is, heated, the, fcc, structure, is, a, close, packed, structure, unlike, the, bcc, structure, thus, the, volume, of, the, iron, decreases, when, this, transformation, occurs, crystallography, is, useful, in, phase, identification, when, manufacturing, or, using, a, material, it, is, generally, desirable, to, know, what, compounds, and, what, phases, are, present, in, the, material, as, their, composition, structure, and, proportions, will, influence, the, material, s, properties, each, phase, has, a, characteristic, arrangement, of, atoms, x, ray, or, neutron, diffraction, can, be, used, to, identify, which, structures, are, present, in, the, material, and, thus, which, compounds, are, present, crystallography, covers, the, enumeration, of, the, symmetry, patterns, which, can, be, formed, by, atoms, in, a, crystal, and, for, this, reason, is, related, to, group, theory, x, ray, crystallography, is, the, primary, method, for, determining, the, molecular, conformations, of, biological, macromolecules, particularly, protein, and, nucleic, acids, such, as, dna, and, rna, the, double, helical, structure, of, dna, was, deduced, from, crystallographic, data, the, first, crystal, structure, of, a, macromolecule, was, solved, in, 1958, a, three, dimensional, model, of, the, myoglobin, molecule, obtained, by, x, ray, analysis, the, protein, data, bank, pdb, is, a, freely, accessible, repository, for, the, structures, of, proteins, and, other, biological, macromolecules, computer, programs, such, as, rasmol, pymol, or, vmd, can, be, used, to, visualize, biological, molecular, structures, neutron, crystallography, is, often, used, to, help, refine, structures, obtained, by, x, ray, methods, or, to, solve, a, specific, bond, the, methods, are, often, viewed, as, complementary, as, x, rays, are, sensitive, to, electron, positions, and, scatter, most, strongly, off, heavy, atoms, while, neutrons, are, sensitive, to, nucleus, positions, and, scatter, strongly, even, off, many, light, isotopes, including, hydrogen, and, deuterium, electron, diffraction, has, been, used, to, determine, some, protein, structures, most, notably, membrane, proteins, and, viral, capsids, the, international, tables, for, crystallography, is, an, eight, book, series, that, outlines, the, standard, notations, for, formatting, describing, and, testing, crystals, the, series, contains, books, that, covers, analysis, methods, and, the, mathematical, procedures, for, determining, organic, structure, through, x, ray, crystallography, electron, diffraction, and, neutron, diffraction, the, international, tables, are, focused, on, procedures, techniques, and, descriptions, and, do, not, list, the, physical, properties, of, individual, crystals, themselves, each, book, is, about, 1000, pages, and, the, titles, of, the, books, are
