the, pyroxenes, commonly, abbreviated, px, are, a, group, of, important, rock, forming, inosilicate, minerals, found, in, many, igneous, and, metamorphic, rocks, pyroxenes, have, the, general, formula, xy, si, al, 2, o, 6, where, x, represents, calcium, ca, sodium, na, iron, fe, ii, or, magnesium, mg, and, more, rarely, zinc, manganese, or, lithium, and, y, represents, ions, of, smaller, size, such, as, chromium, cr, aluminium, al, magnesium, mg, cobalt, co, manganese, mn, scandium, sc, titanium, ti, vanadium, v, or, even, iron, fe, ii, or, fe, iii, although, aluminium, substitutes, extensively, for, silicon, in, silicates, such, as, feldspars, and, amphiboles, the, substitution, occurs, only, to, a, limited, extent, in, most, pyroxenes, they, share, a, common, structure, consisting, of, single, chains, of, silica, tetrahedra, pyroxenes, that, crystallize, in, the, monoclinic, system, are, known, as, clinopyroxenes, and, those, that, crystallize, in, the, orthorhombic, system, are, known, as, orthopyroxenes, the, name, pyroxene, is, derived, from, the, ancient, greek, words, for, fire, pur, and, stranger, x, nos, pyroxenes, were, so, named, due, to, their, presence, in, volcanic, lavas, where, they, are, sometimes, found, as, crystals, embedded, in, volcanic, glass, it, was, assumed, they, were, impurities, in, the, glass, hence, the, name, meaning, fire, stranger, however, they, are, simply, early, forming, minerals, that, crystallized, before, the, lava, erupted, the, upper, mantle, of, earth, is, composed, mainly, of, olivine, and, pyroxene, minerals, pyroxene, and, feldspar, are, the, major, minerals, in, basalt, andesite, and, gabbro, rocks, pyroxenes, are, the, most, common, single, chain, silicate, minerals, the, only, other, important, group, of, single, chain, silicates, the, pyroxenoids, are, much, less, common, their, structure, consists, of, parallel, chains, of, negatively, charged, silica, tetrahedra, bonded, together, by, metal, cations, in, other, words, each, silicon, ion, in, a, pyroxene, crystal, is, surrounded, by, four, oxygen, ions, forming, a, tetrahedron, around, the, relatively, small, silicon, ion, each, silicon, ion, shares, two, oxygen, ions, with, neighboring, silicon, ions, in, the, chain, the, tetrahedra, in, the, chain, all, face, in, the, same, direction, so, that, two, oxygen, ions, are, located, on, one, face, of, the, chain, for, every, oxygen, ion, on, the, other, face, of, the, chain, the, oxygen, ions, on, the, narrower, face, are, described, as, apical, oxygen, ions, pairs, of, chains, are, bound, together, on, their, apical, sides, by, y, cations, with, each, y, cation, surrounded, by, six, oxygen, ions, the, resulting, pairs, of, single, chains, have, sometimes, been, likened, to, i, beams, the, i, beams, interlock, with, additional, x, cations, bonding, the, outer, faces, of, the, i, beams, to, neighboring, i, beams, and, providing, the, remaining, charge, balance, this, binding, is, relatively, weak, and, gives, pyroxenes, their, characteristic, cleavage, the, chain, silicate, structure, of, the, pyroxenes, offers, much, flexibility, in, the, incorporation, of, various, cations, and, the, names, of, the, pyroxene, minerals, are, primarily, defined, by, their, chemical, composition, pyroxene, minerals, are, named, according, to, the, chemical, species, occupying, the, x, or, m2, site, the, y, or, m1, site, and, the, tetrahedral, t, site, cations, in, y, m1, site, are, closely, bound, to, 6, oxygens, in, octahedral, coordination, cations, in, the, x, m2, site, can, be, coordinated, with, 6, to, 8, oxygen, atoms, depending, on, the, cation, size, twenty, mineral, names, are, recognised, by, the, international, mineralogical, association, s, commission, on, new, minerals, and, mineral, names, and, 105, previously, used, names, have, been, discarded, a, typical, pyroxene, has, mostly, silicon, in, the, tetrahedral, site, and, predominately, ions, with, a, charge, of, 2, in, both, the, x, and, y, sites, giving, the, approximate, formula, xyt, 2, o, 6, the, names, of, the, common, calcium, iron, magnesium, pyroxenes, are, defined, in, the, pyroxene, quadrilateral, the, enstatite, ferrosilite, series, sio, 3, includes, the, common, rock, forming, mineral, hypersthene, contains, up, to, 5, mol, calcium, and, exists, in, three, polymorphs, orthorhombic, orthoenstatite, and, protoenstatite, and, monoclinic, clinoenstatite, and, the, ferrosilite, equivalents, increasing, the, calcium, content, prevents, the, formation, of, the, orthorhombic, phases, and, pigeonite, si, 2, o, 6, only, crystallises, in, the, monoclinic, system, there, is, not, complete, solid, solution, in, calcium, content, and, mg, fe, ca, pyroxenes, with, calcium, contents, between, about, 15, and, 25, mol, are, not, stable, with, respect, to, a, pair, of, exolved, crystals, this, leads, to, a, miscibility, gap, between, pigeonite, and, augite, compositions, there, is, an, arbitrary, separation, between, augite, and, the, diopside, hedenbergite, camgsi, 2, o, 6, cafesi, 2, o, 6, solid, solution, the, divide, is, taken, at, 45, mol, ca, as, the, calcium, ion, cannot, occupy, the, y, site, pyroxenes, with, more, than, 50, mol, calcium, are, not, possible, a, related, mineral, wollastonite, has, the, formula, of, the, hypothetical, calcium, end, member, ca, 2, si, 2, o, 6, but, important, structural, differences, mean, that, it, is, instead, classified, as, a, pyroxenoid, magnesium, calcium, and, iron, are, by, no, means, the, only, cations, that, can, occupy, the, x, and, y, sites, in, the, pyroxene, structure, a, second, important, series, of, pyroxene, minerals, are, the, sodium, rich, pyroxenes, corresponding, to, the, pyroxene, triangle, nomenclature, the, inclusion, of, sodium, which, has, a, charge, of, 1, into, the, pyroxene, implies, the, need, for, a, mechanism, to, make, up, the, missing, positive, charge, in, jadeite, and, aegirine, this, is, added, by, the, inclusion, of, a, 3, cation, aluminium, and, iron, iii, respectively, on, the, y, site, sodium, pyroxenes, with, more, than, 20, mol, calcium, magnesium, or, iron, ii, components, are, known, as, omphacite, and, aegirine, augite, with, 80, or, more, of, these, components, the, pyroxene, is, classified, using, the, quadrilateral, diagram, a, wide, range, of, other, cations, that, can, be, accommodated, in, the, different, sites, of, pyroxene, structures, in, assigning, ions, to, sites, the, basic, rule, is, to, work, from, left, to, right, in, this, table, first, assigning, all, silicon, to, the, t, site, and, then, filling, the, site, with, the, remaining, aluminium, and, finally, iron, iii, extra, aluminium, or, iron, can, be, accommodated, in, the, y, site, and, bulkier, ions, on, the, x, site, not, all, the, resulting, mechanisms, to, achieve, charge, neutrality, follow, the, sodium, example, above, and, there, are, several, alternative, schemes, in, nature, more, than, one, substitution, may, be, found, in, the, same, mineral
