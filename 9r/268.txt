in, astronomy, stellar, kinematics, is, the, observational, study, or, measurement, of, the, kinematics, or, motions, of, stars, through, space, stellar, kinematics, encompasses, the, measurement, of, stellar, velocities, in, the, milky, way, and, its, satellites, as, well, as, the, internal, kinematics, of, more, distant, galaxies, measurement, of, the, kinematics, of, stars, in, different, subcomponents, of, the, milky, way, including, the, thin, disk, the, thick, disk, the, bulge, and, the, stellar, halo, provides, important, information, about, the, formation, and, evolutionary, history, of, our, galaxy, kinematic, measurements, can, also, identify, exotic, phenomena, such, as, hypervelocity, stars, escaping, from, the, milky, way, which, are, interpreted, as, the, result, of, gravitational, encounters, of, binary, stars, with, the, supermassive, black, hole, at, the, galactic, center, stellar, kinematics, is, related, to, but, distinct, from, the, subject, of, stellar, dynamics, which, involves, the, theoretical, study, or, modeling, of, the, motions, of, stars, under, the, influence, of, gravity, stellar, dynamical, models, of, systems, such, as, galaxies, or, star, clusters, are, often, compared, with, or, tested, against, stellar, kinematic, data, to, study, their, evolutionary, history, and, mass, distributions, and, to, detect, the, presence, of, dark, matter, or, supermassive, black, holes, through, their, gravitational, influence, on, stellar, orbits, the, component, of, stellar, motion, toward, or, away, from, the, sun, known, as, radial, velocity, can, be, measured, from, the, spectrum, shift, caused, by, the, doppler, effect, the, transverse, or, proper, motion, must, be, found, by, taking, a, series, of, positional, determinations, against, more, distant, objects, once, the, distance, to, a, star, is, determined, through, astrometric, means, such, as, parallax, the, space, velocity, can, be, computed, this, is, the, star, s, actual, motion, relative, to, the, sun, or, the, local, standard, of, rest, lsr, the, latter, is, typically, taken, as, a, position, at, the, sun, s, present, location, that, is, following, a, circular, orbit, around, the, galactic, center, at, the, mean, velocity, of, those, nearby, stars, with, low, velocity, dispersion, the, sun, s, motion, with, respect, to, the, lsr, is, called, the, peculiar, solar, motion, the, components, of, space, velocity, in, the, milky, way, s, galactic, coordinate, system, are, usually, designated, u, v, and, w, given, in, km, s, with, u, positive, in, the, direction, of, the, galactic, center, v, positive, in, the, direction, of, galactic, rotation, and, w, positive, in, the, direction, of, the, north, galactic, pole, the, peculiar, motion, of, the, sun, with, respect, to, the, lsr, is, with, statistical, uncertainty, 0, 69, 0, 75, 0, 47, 0, 47, 0, 37, 0, 36, km, s, and, systematic, uncertainty, 1, 2, 0, 5, km, s, note, that, v, is, 7, km, s, larger, than, estimated, in, 1998, by, dehnen, et, al, stellar, kinematics, yields, important, astrophysical, information, about, stars, and, the, galaxies, in, which, they, reside, stellar, kinematics, data, combined, with, astrophysical, modeling, produces, important, information, about, the, galactic, system, as, a, whole, measured, stellar, velocities, in, the, innermost, regions, of, galaxies, including, the, milky, way, have, provided, evidence, that, many, galaxies, host, supermassive, black, holes, at, their, center, in, farther, out, regions, of, galaxies, such, as, within, the, galactic, halo, velocity, measurements, of, globular, clusters, orbiting, in, these, halo, regions, of, galaxies, provides, evidence, for, dark, matter, both, of, these, cases, derive, from, the, key, fact, that, stellar, kinematics, can, be, related, to, the, overall, potential, in, which, the, stars, are, bound, this, means, that, if, accurate, stellar, kinematics, measurements, are, made, for, a, star, or, group, of, stars, orbiting, in, a, certain, region, of, a, galaxy, the, gravitational, potential, and, mass, distribution, can, be, inferred, given, that, the, gravitational, potential, in, which, the, star, is, bound, produces, its, orbit, and, serves, as, the, impetus, for, its, stellar, motion, examples, of, using, kinematics, combined, with, modeling, to, construct, an, astrophysical, system, include, in, 2018, the, gaia, data, release, 2, gaia, dr2, marked, a, significant, advancement, in, stellar, kinematics, offering, a, rich, dataset, of, precise, measurements, this, release, included, detailed, stellar, kinematic, and, stellar, parallax, data, contributing, to, a, more, nuanced, understanding, of, the, milky, way, s, structure, notably, it, facilitated, the, determination, of, proper, motions, for, numerous, celestial, objects, including, the, absolute, proper, motions, of, 75, globular, clusters, situated, at, distances, extending, up, to, g, 21, displaystyle, g, 21, and, a, bright, limit, of, g, displaystyle, g, approx, 3, displaystyle, 3, furthermore, gaia, s, comprehensive, dataset, enabled, the, measurement, of, absolute, proper, motions, in, nearby, dwarf, spheroidal, galaxies, serving, as, crucial, indicators, for, understanding, the, mass, distribution, within, the, milky, way, gaia, dr3, improved, the, quality, of, previously, published, data, by, providing, detailed, astrophysical, parameters, while, the, complete, gaia, dr4, is, yet, to, be, unveiled, the, latest, release, offers, enhanced, insights, into, white, dwarfs, hypervelocity, stars, cosmological, gravitational, lensing, and, the, merger, history, of, the, galaxy, stars, within, galaxies, may, be, classified, based, on, their, kinematics, for, example, the, stars, in, the, milky, way, can, be, subdivided, into, two, general, populations, based, on, their, metallicity, or, proportion, of, elements, with, atomic, numbers, higher, than, helium, among, nearby, stars, it, has, been, found, that, population, i, stars, with, higher, metallicity, are, generally, located, in, the, stellar, disk, while, older, population, ii, stars, are, in, random, orbits, with, little, net, rotation, the, latter, have, elliptical, orbits, that, are, inclined, to, the, plane, of, the, milky, way, comparison, of, the, kinematics, of, nearby, stars, has, also, led, to, the, identification, of, stellar, associations, these, are, most, likely, groups, of, stars, that, share, a, common, point, of, origin, in, giant, molecular, clouds, there, are, many, additional, ways, to, classify, stars, based, on, their, measured, velocity, components, and, this, provides, detailed, information, about, the, nature, of, the, star, s, formation, time, its, present, location, and, the, general, structure, of, the, galaxy, as, a, star, moves, in, a, galaxy, the, smoothed, out, gravitational, potential, of, all, the, other, stars, and, other, mass, within, the, galaxy, plays, a, dominant, role, in, determining, the, stellar, motion, stellar, kinematics, can, provide, insights, into, the, location, of, where, the, star, formed, within, the, galaxy, measurements, of, an, individual, star, s, kinematics, can, identify, stars, that, are, peculiar, outliers, such, as, a, high, velocity, star, moving, much, faster, than, its, nearby, neighbors, depending, on, the, definition, a, high, velocity, star, is, a, star, moving, faster, than, 65, km, s, to, 100, km, s, relative, to, the, average, motion, of, the, other, stars, in, the, star, s, neighborhood, the, velocity, is, also, sometimes, defined, as, supersonic, relative, to, the, surrounding, interstellar, medium, the, three, types, of, high, velocity, stars, are, runaway, stars, halo, stars, and, hypervelocity, stars, high, velocity, stars, were, studied, by, jan, oort, who, used, their, kinematic, data, to, predict, that, high, velocity, stars, have, very, little, tangential, velocity, a, runaway, star, is, one, that, is, moving, through, space, with, an, abnormally, high, velocity, relative, to, the, surrounding, interstellar, medium, the, proper, motion, of, a, runaway, star, often, points, exactly, away, from, a, stellar, association, of, which, the, star, was, formerly, a, member, before, it, was, hurled, out, mechanisms, that, may, give, rise, to, a, runaway, star, include, multiple, mechanisms, may, accelerate, the, same, runaway, star, for, example, a, massive, star, that, was, originally, ejected, due, to, gravitational, interactions, with, its, stellar, neighbors, may, itself, go, supernova, producing, a, remnant, with, a, velocity, modulated, by, the, supernova, kick, if, this, supernova, occurs, in, the, very, nearby, vicinity, of, other, stars, it, is, possible, that, it, may, produce, more, runaways, in, the, process, an, example, of, a, related, set, of, runaway, stars, is, the, case, of, ae, aurigae, 53, arietis, and, mu, columbae, all, of, which, are, moving, away, from, each, other, at, velocities, of, over, 100, km, s, for, comparison, the, sun, moves, through, the, milky, way, at, about, 20, km, s, faster, than, the, local, average, tracing, their, motions, back, their, paths, intersect, near, to, the, orion, nebula, about, 2, million, years, ago, barnard, s, loop, is, believed, to, be, the, remnant, of, the, supernova, that, launched, the, other, stars, another, example, is, the, x, ray, object, vela, x, 1, where, photodigital, techniques, reveal, the, presence, of, a, typical, supersonic, bow, shock, hyperbola, halo, stars, are, very, old, stars, that, do, not, follow, circular, orbits, around, the, center, of, the, milky, way, within, its, disk, instead, the, halo, stars, travel, in, elliptical, orbits, often, inclined, to, the, disk, which, take, them, well, above, and, below, the, plane, of, the, milky, way, although, their, orbital, velocities, relative, to, the, milky, way, may, be, no, faster, than, disk, stars, their, different, paths, result, in, high, relative, velocities, typical, examples, are, the, halo, stars, passing, through, the, disk, of, the, milky, way, at, steep, angles, one, of, the, nearest, 45, stars, called, kapteyn, s, star, is, an, example, of, the, high, velocity, stars, that, lie, near, the, sun, its, observed, radial, velocity, is, 245, km, s, and, the, components, of, its, space, velocity, are, u, 19, km, s, v, 288, km, s, and, w, 52, km, s, hypervelocity, stars, designated, as, hvs, or, hv, in, stellar, catalogues, have, substantially, higher, velocities, than, the, rest, of, the, stellar, population, of, a, galaxy, some, of, these, stars, may, even, exceed, the, escape, velocity, of, the, galaxy, in, the, milky, way, stars, usually, have, velocities, on, the, order, of, 100, km, s, whereas, hypervelocity, stars, typically, have, velocities, on, the, order, of, 1000, km, s, most, of, these, fast, moving, stars, are, thought, to, be, produced, near, the, center, of, the, milky, way, where, there, is, a, larger, population, of, these, objects, than, further, out, one, of, the, fastest, known, stars, in, our, galaxy, is, the, o, class, sub, dwarf, us, 708, which, is, moving, away, from, the, milky, way, with, a, total, velocity, of, around, 1200, km, s, jack, g, hills, first, predicted, the, existence, of, hvss, in, 1988, this, was, later, confirmed, in, 2005, by, warren, brown, margaret, geller, scott, kenyon, and, michael, kurtz, as, of, 2008, 10, unbound, hvss, were, known, one, of, which, is, believed, to, have, originated, from, the, large, magellanic, cloud, rather, than, the, milky, way, further, measurements, placed, its, origin, within, the, milky, way, due, to, uncertainty, about, the, distribution, of, mass, within, the, milky, way, determining, whether, a, hvs, is, unbound, is, difficult, a, further, five, known, high, velocity, stars, may, be, unbound, from, the, milky, way, and, 16, hvss, are, thought, to, be, bound, the, nearest, currently, known, hvs, hvs2, is, about, 19, kpc, from, the, sun, as, of, 1, september, 2017, there, have, been, roughly, 20, observed, hypervelocity, stars, though, most, of, these, were, observed, in, the, northern, hemisphere, the, possibility, remains, that, there, are, hvss, only, observable, from, the, southern, hemisphere, it, is, believed, that, about, 1, 000, hvss, exist, in, the, milky, way, considering, that, there, are, around, 100, billion, stars, in, the, milky, way, this, is, a, minuscule, fraction, 0, 000001, results, from, the, second, data, release, of, gaia, dr2, show, that, most, high, velocity, late, type, stars, have, a, high, probability, of, being, bound, to, the, milky, way, however, distant, hypervelocity, star, candidates, are, more, promising, in, march, 2019, lamost, hvs1, was, reported, to, be, a, confirmed, hypervelocity, star, ejected, from, the, stellar, disk, of, the, milky, way, in, july, 2019, astronomers, reported, finding, an, a, type, star, s5, hvs1, traveling, 1, 755, km, s, 3, 930, 000, mph, faster, than, any, other, star, detected, so, far, the, star, is, in, the, grus, or, crane, constellation, in, the, southern, sky, and, is, about, 29, 000, ly, 1, 8, 10, 9, au, from, earth, it, may, have, been, ejected, from, the, milky, way, after, interacting, with, sagittarius, a, the, supermassive, black, hole, at, the, center, of, the, galaxy, hvss, are, believed, to, predominantly, originate, by, close, encounters, of, binary, stars, with, the, supermassive, black, hole, in, the, center, of, the, milky, way, one, of, the, two, partners, is, gravitationally, captured, by, the, black, hole, in, the, sense, of, entering, orbit, around, it, while, the, other, escapes, with, high, velocity, becoming, a, hvs, such, maneuvers, are, analogous, to, the, capture, and, ejection, of, interstellar, objects, by, a, star, supernova, induced, hvss, may, also, be, possible, although, they, are, presumably, rare, in, this, scenario, a, hvs, is, ejected, from, a, close, binary, system, as, a, result, of, the, companion, star, undergoing, a, supernova, explosion, ejection, velocities, up, to, 770, km, s, as, measured, from, the, galactic, rest, frame, are, possible, for, late, type, b, stars, this, mechanism, can, explain, the, origin, of, hvss, which, are, ejected, from, the, galactic, disk, known, hvss, are, main, sequence, stars, with, masses, a, few, times, that, of, the, sun, hvss, with, smaller, masses, are, also, expected, and, g, k, dwarf, hvs, candidates, have, been, found, some, hvss, may, have, originated, from, a, disrupted, dwarf, galaxy, when, it, made, its, closest, approach, to, the, center, of, the, milky, way, some, of, its, stars, broke, free, and, were, thrown, into, space, due, to, the, slingshot, like, effect, of, the, boost, some, neutron, stars, are, inferred, to, be, traveling, with, similar, speeds, this, could, be, related, to, hvss, and, the, hvs, ejection, mechanism, neutron, stars, are, the, remnants, of, supernova, explosions, and, their, extreme, speeds, are, very, likely, the, result, of, an, asymmetric, supernova, explosion, or, the, loss, of, their, near, partner, during, the, supernova, explosions, that, forms, them, the, neutron, star, rx, j0822, 4300, which, was, measured, to, move, at, a, record, speed, of, over, 1, 500, km, s, 0, 5, of, the, speed, of, light, in, 2007, by, the, chandra, x, ray, observatory, is, thought, to, have, been, produced, the, first, way, one, theory, regarding, the, ignition, of, type, ia, supernovae, invokes, the, onset, of, a, merger, between, two, white, dwarfs, in, a, binary, star, system, triggering, the, explosion, of, the, more, massive, white, dwarf, if, the, less, massive, white, dwarf, is, not, destroyed, during, the, explosion, it, will, no, longer, be, gravitationally, bound, to, its, destroyed, companion, causing, it, to, leave, the, system, as, a, hypervelocity, star, with, its, pre, explosion, orbital, velocity, of, 1000, 2500, km, s, in, 2018, three, such, stars, were, discovered, using, data, from, the, gaia, satellite, as, of, 2014, twenty, hvs, were, known, a, set, of, stars, with, similar, space, motion, and, ages, is, known, as, a, kinematic, group, these, are, stars, that, could, share, a, common, origin, such, as, the, evaporation, of, an, open, cluster, the, remains, of, a, star, forming, region, or, collections, of, overlapping, star, formation, bursts, at, differing, time, periods, in, adjacent, regions, most, stars, are, born, within, molecular, clouds, known, as, stellar, nurseries, the, stars, formed, within, such, a, cloud, compose, gravitationally, bound, open, clusters, containing, dozens, to, thousands, of, members, with, similar, ages, and, compositions, these, clusters, dissociate, with, time, groups, of, young, stars, that, escape, a, cluster, or, are, no, longer, bound, to, each, other, form, stellar, associations, as, these, stars, age, and, disperse, their, association, is, no, longer, readily, apparent, and, they, become, moving, groups, of, stars, astronomers, are, able, to, determine, if, stars, are, members, of, a, kinematic, group, because, they, share, the, same, age, metallicity, and, kinematics, radial, velocity, and, proper, motion, as, the, stars, in, a, moving, group, formed, in, proximity, and, at, nearly, the, same, time, from, the, same, gas, cloud, although, later, disrupted, by, tidal, forces, they, share, similar, characteristics, a, stellar, association, is, a, very, loose, star, cluster, whose, stars, share, a, common, origin, and, are, still, moving, together, through, space, but, have, become, gravitationally, unbound, associations, are, primarily, identified, by, their, common, movement, vectors, and, ages, identification, by, chemical, composition, is, also, used, to, factor, in, association, memberships, stellar, associations, were, first, discovered, by, the, armenian, astronomer, viktor, ambartsumian, in, 1947, the, conventional, name, for, an, association, uses, the, names, or, abbreviations, of, the, constellation, or, constellations, in, which, they, are, located, the, association, type, and, sometimes, a, numerical, identifier, viktor, ambartsumian, first, categorized, stellar, associations, into, two, groups, ob, and, t, based, on, the, properties, of, their, stars, a, third, category, r, was, later, suggested, by, sidney, van, den, bergh, for, associations, that, illuminate, reflection, nebulae, the, ob, t, and, r, associations, form, a, continuum, of, young, stellar, groupings, but, it, is, currently, uncertain, whether, they, are, an, evolutionary, sequence, or, represent, some, other, factor, at, work, some, groups, also, display, properties, of, both, ob, and, t, associations, so, the, categorization, is, not, always, clear, cut, young, associations, will, contain, 10, to, 100, massive, stars, of, spectral, class, o, and, b, and, are, known, as, ob, associations, in, addition, these, associations, also, contain, hundreds, or, thousands, of, low, and, intermediate, mass, stars, association, members, are, believed, to, form, within, the, same, small, volume, inside, a, giant, molecular, cloud, once, the, surrounding, dust, and, gas, is, blown, away, the, remaining, stars, become, unbound, and, begin, to, drift, apart, it, is, believed, that, the, majority, of, all, stars, in, the, milky, way, were, formed, in, ob, associations, o, class, stars, are, short, lived, and, will, expire, as, supernovae, after, roughly, one, million, years, as, a, result, ob, associations, are, generally, only, a, few, million, years, in, age, or, less, the, o, b, stars, in, the, association, will, have, burned, all, their, fuel, within, ten, million, years, compare, this, to, the, current, age, of, the, sun, at, about, five, billion, years, the, hipparcos, satellite, provided, measurements, that, located, a, dozen, ob, associations, within, 650, parsecs, of, the, sun, the, nearest, ob, association, is, the, scorpius, centaurus, association, located, about, 400, light, years, from, the, sun, ob, associations, have, also, been, found, in, the, large, magellanic, cloud, and, the, andromeda, galaxy, these, associations, can, be, quite, sparse, spanning, 1, 500, light, years, in, diameter, young, stellar, groups, can, contain, a, number, of, infant, t, tauri, stars, that, are, still, in, the, process, of, entering, the, main, sequence, these, sparse, populations, of, up, to, a, thousand, t, tauri, stars, are, known, as, t, associations, the, nearest, example, is, the, taurus, auriga, t, association, tau, aur, t, association, located, at, a, distance, of, 140, parsecs, from, the, sun, other, examples, of, t, associations, include, the, r, corona, australis, t, association, the, lupus, t, association, the, chamaeleon, t, association, and, the, velorum, t, association, t, associations, are, often, found, in, the, vicinity, of, the, molecular, cloud, from, which, they, formed, some, but, not, all, include, o, b, class, stars, group, members, have, the, same, age, and, origin, the, same, chemical, composition, and, the, same, amplitude, and, direction, in, their, vector, of, velocity, associations, of, stars, that, illuminate, reflection, nebulae, are, called, r, associations, a, name, suggested, by, sidney, van, den, bergh, after, he, discovered, that, the, stars, in, these, nebulae, had, a, non, uniform, distribution, these, young, stellar, groupings, contain, main, sequence, stars, that, are, not, sufficiently, massive, to, disperse, the, interstellar, clouds, in, which, they, formed, this, allows, the, properties, of, the, surrounding, dark, cloud, to, be, examined, by, astronomers, because, r, associations, are, more, plentiful, than, ob, associations, they, can, be, used, to, trace, out, the, structure, of, the, galactic, spiral, arms, an, example, of, an, r, association, is, monoceros, r2, located, 830, 50, parsecs, from, the, sun, if, the, remnants, of, a, stellar, association, drift, through, the, milky, way, as, a, somewhat, coherent, assemblage, then, they, are, termed, a, moving, group, or, kinematic, group, moving, groups, can, be, old, such, as, the, hr, 1614, moving, group, at, two, billion, years, or, young, such, as, the, ab, dor, moving, group, at, only, 120, million, years, moving, groups, were, studied, intensely, by, olin, eggen, in, the, 1960s, a, list, of, the, nearest, young, moving, groups, has, been, compiled, by, l, pez, santiago, et, al, the, closest, is, the, ursa, major, moving, group, which, includes, all, of, the, stars, in, the, plough, big, dipper, asterism, except, for, dubhe, and, ursae, majoris, this, is, sufficiently, close, that, the, sun, lies, in, its, outer, fringes, without, being, part, of, the, group, hence, although, members, are, concentrated, at, declinations, near, 60, n, some, outliers, are, as, far, away, across, the, sky, as, triangulum, australe, at, 70, s, the, list, of, young, moving, groups, is, constantly, evolving, the, banyan, tool, currently, lists, 29, nearby, young, moving, groups, recent, additions, to, nearby, moving, groups, are, the, volans, carina, association, vca, discovered, with, gaia, and, the, argus, association, arg, confirmed, with, gaia, moving, groups, can, sometimes, be, further, subdivided, in, smaller, distinct, groups, the, great, austral, young, association, gaya, complex, was, found, to, be, subdivided, into, the, moving, groups, carina, columba, and, tucana, horologium, the, three, associations, are, not, very, distinct, from, each, other, and, have, similar, kinematic, properties, young, moving, groups, have, well, known, ages, and, can, help, with, the, characterization, of, objects, with, hard, to, estimate, ages, such, as, brown, dwarfs, members, of, nearby, young, moving, groups, are, also, candidates, for, directly, imaged, protoplanetary, disks, such, as, tw, hydrae, or, directly, imaged, exoplanets, such, as, beta, pictoris, b, or, gu, psc, b, a, stellar, stream, is, an, association, of, stars, orbiting, a, galaxy, that, was, once, a, globular, cluster, or, dwarf, galaxy, that, has, now, been, torn, apart, and, stretched, out, along, its, orbit, by, tidal, forces, some, nearby, kinematic, groups, include
