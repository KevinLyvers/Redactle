bismuth, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, bi, and, atomic, number, 83, it, is, a, post, transition, metal, and, one, of, the, pnictogens, with, chemical, properties, resembling, its, lighter, group, 15, siblings, arsenic, and, antimony, elemental, bismuth, occurs, naturally, and, its, sulfide, and, oxide, forms, are, important, commercial, ores, the, free, element, is, 86, as, dense, as, lead, it, is, a, brittle, metal, with, a, silvery, white, color, when, freshly, produced, surface, oxidation, generally, gives, samples, of, the, metal, a, somewhat, rosy, cast, further, oxidation, under, heat, can, give, bismuth, a, vividly, iridescent, appearance, due, to, thin, film, interference, bismuth, is, both, the, most, diamagnetic, element, and, one, of, the, least, thermally, conductive, metals, known, bismuth, used, to, be, considered, the, element, with, the, highest, atomic, mass, whose, nuclei, do, not, spontaneously, decay, however, in, 2003, it, was, discovered, to, be, extremely, weakly, radioactive, the, metal, s, only, primordial, isotope, bismuth, 209, undergoes, alpha, decay, with, a, half, life, about, a, billion, times, the, estimated, age, of, the, universe, bismuth, metal, has, been, known, since, ancient, times, before, modern, analytical, methods, bismuth, s, metallurgical, similarities, to, lead, and, tin, often, led, it, to, be, confused, with, those, metals, the, etymology, of, bismuth, is, uncertain, the, name, may, come, from, mid, sixteenth, century, neo, latin, translations, of, the, german, words, wei, e, masse, or, wismuth, meaning, white, mass, which, were, rendered, as, bisemutum, or, bisemutium, bismuth, compounds, account, for, about, half, the, global, production, of, bismuth, they, are, used, in, cosmetics, pigments, and, a, few, pharmaceuticals, notably, bismuth, subsalicylate, used, to, treat, diarrhea, bismuth, s, unusual, propensity, to, expand, as, it, solidifies, is, responsible, for, some, of, its, uses, as, in, the, casting, of, printing, type, bismuth, when, in, its, elemental, form, has, unusually, low, toxicity, for, a, heavy, metal, as, the, toxicity, of, lead, and, the, cost, of, its, environmental, remediation, became, more, apparent, during, the, 20th, century, suitable, bismuth, alloys, have, gained, popularity, as, replacements, for, lead, presently, around, a, third, of, global, bismuth, production, is, dedicated, to, needs, formerly, met, by, lead, bismuth, metal, has, been, known, since, ancient, times, and, it, was, one, of, the, first, 10, metals, to, have, been, discovered, the, name, bismuth, dates, to, around, 1665, and, is, of, uncertain, etymology, the, name, possibly, comes, from, obsolete, german, bismuth, wismut, wissmuth, early, 16th, century, perhaps, related, to, old, high, german, hwiz, white, the, neo, latin, bisemutium, coined, by, georgius, agricola, who, latinized, many, german, mining, and, technical, words, is, from, the, german, wismuth, itself, perhaps, from, wei, e, masse, meaning, white, mass, the, element, was, confused, in, early, times, with, tin, and, lead, because, of, its, resemblance, to, those, elements, because, bismuth, has, been, known, since, ancient, times, no, one, person, is, credited, with, its, discovery, agricola, 1546, states, that, bismuth, is, a, distinct, metal, in, a, family, of, metals, including, tin, and, lead, this, was, based, on, observation, of, the, metals, and, their, physical, properties, miners, in, the, age, of, alchemy, also, gave, bismuth, the, name, tectum, argenti, or, silver, being, made, in, the, sense, of, silver, still, in, the, process, of, being, formed, within, the, earth, bismuth, was, also, known, to, the, incas, and, used, along, with, the, usual, copper, and, tin, in, a, special, bronze, alloy, for, knives, beginning, with, johann, heinrich, pott, in, 1738, carl, wilhelm, scheele, and, torbern, olof, bergman, the, distinctness, of, lead, and, bismuth, became, clear, and, claude, fran, ois, geoffroy, demonstrated, in, 1753, that, this, metal, is, distinct, from, lead, and, tin, bismuth, is, a, brittle, metal, with, a, dark, silver, pink, hue, often, with, an, iridescent, oxide, tarnish, showing, many, colors, from, yellow, to, blue, the, spiral, stair, stepped, structure, of, bismuth, crystals, is, the, result, of, a, higher, growth, rate, around, the, outside, edges, than, on, the, inside, edges, the, variations, in, the, thickness, of, the, oxide, layer, that, forms, on, the, surface, of, the, crystal, cause, different, wavelengths, of, light, to, interfere, upon, reflection, thus, displaying, a, rainbow, of, colors, when, burned, in, oxygen, bismuth, burns, with, a, blue, flame, and, its, oxide, forms, yellow, fumes, its, toxicity, is, much, lower, than, that, of, its, neighbors, in, the, periodic, table, such, as, lead, and, antimony, no, other, metal, is, verified, to, be, more, naturally, diamagnetic, than, bismuth, superdiamagnetism, is, a, different, physical, phenomenon, of, any, metal, it, has, one, of, the, lowest, values, of, thermal, conductivity, after, manganese, neptunium, and, plutonium, and, the, highest, hall, coefficient, it, has, a, high, electrical, resistivity, when, deposited, in, sufficiently, thin, layers, on, a, substrate, bismuth, is, a, semiconductor, despite, being, a, post, transition, metal, elemental, bismuth, is, denser, in, the, liquid, phase, than, the, solid, a, characteristic, it, shares, with, germanium, silicon, gallium, and, water, bismuth, expands, 3, 32, on, solidification, therefore, it, was, long, a, component, of, low, melting, typesetting, alloys, where, it, compensated, for, the, contraction, of, the, other, alloying, components, to, form, almost, isostatic, bismuth, lead, eutectic, alloys, though, virtually, unseen, in, nature, high, purity, bismuth, can, form, distinctive, colorful, hopper, crystals, it, is, relatively, nontoxic, and, has, a, low, melting, point, just, above, 271, c, so, crystals, may, be, grown, using, a, household, stove, although, the, resulting, crystals, will, tend, to, be, of, lower, quality, than, lab, grown, crystals, at, ambient, conditions, bismuth, shares, the, same, layered, structure, as, the, metallic, forms, of, arsenic, and, antimony, crystallizing, in, the, rhombohedral, lattice, when, compressed, at, room, temperature, this, bi, i, structure, changes, first, to, the, monoclinic, bi, ii, at, 2, 55, gpa, then, to, the, tetragonal, bi, iii, at, 2, 7, gpa, and, finally, to, the, body, centered, cubic, bi, v, at, 7, 7, gpa, the, corresponding, transitions, can, be, monitored, via, changes, in, electrical, conductivity, they, are, rather, reproducible, and, abrupt, and, are, therefore, used, for, calibration, of, high, pressure, equipment, bismuth, is, stable, to, both, dry, and, moist, air, at, ordinary, temperatures, when, red, hot, it, reacts, with, water, to, make, bismuth, iii, oxide, it, reacts, with, fluorine, to, make, bismuth, v, fluoride, at, 500, c, or, bismuth, iii, fluoride, at, lower, temperatures, typically, from, bi, melts, with, other, halogens, it, yields, only, bismuth, iii, halides, the, trihalides, are, corrosive, and, easily, react, with, moisture, forming, oxyhalides, with, the, formula, biox, bismuth, dissolves, in, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, to, make, bismuth, iii, sulfate, and, sulfur, dioxide, it, reacts, with, nitric, acid, to, make, bismuth, iii, nitrate, which, decomposes, into, nitrogen, dioxide, when, heated, it, also, dissolves, in, hydrochloric, acid, but, only, with, oxygen, present, the, only, primordial, isotope, of, bismuth, bismuth, 209, was, regarded, as, the, heaviest, stable, nuclide, but, it, had, long, been, suspected, to, be, unstable, on, theoretical, grounds, this, was, finally, demonstrated, in, 2003, when, researchers, at, the, institut, d, astrophysique, spatiale, in, orsay, france, measured, the, alpha, decay, half, life, of, 209, bi, to, be, 2, 01, 10, 19, years, 3, bq, mg, over, 10, 9, x, longer, than, the, estimated, age, of, the, universe, due, to, its, hugely, long, half, life, for, all, known, medical, and, industrial, applications, bismuth, can, be, treated, as, stable, the, radioactivity, is, of, academic, interest, because, bismuth, is, one, of, a, few, elements, whose, radioactivity, was, suspected, and, theoretically, predicted, before, being, detected, in, the, laboratory, bismuth, has, the, longest, known, decay, half, life, though, tellurium, 128, has, a, double, beta, decay, half, life, of, over, 2, 2, 10, 24, years, bismuth, s, extremely, long, half, life, means, that, less, than, 1, 10, 9, of, the, bismuth, present, when, the, earth, formed, has, decayed, into, thallium, since, then, six, isotopes, of, bismuth, with, short, half, lives, 210, 215, inclusive, occur, in, the, natural, radioactive, decay, chains, of, actinium, radium, thorium, and, neptunium, and, more, have, been, synthesized, though, all, primordial, 237, np, has, long, since, decayed, it, is, continually, regenerated, by, n, 2n, knockout, reactions, on, natural, 238, u, commercially, bismuth, 213, can, be, produced, by, bombarding, radium, with, bremsstrahlung, photons, from, a, linear, particle, accelerator, in, 1997, an, antibody, conjugate, with, bismuth, 213, which, has, a, 45, minute, half, life, and, decays, was, used, to, treat, leukemia, patients, this, isotope, has, also, been, tried, in, cancer, treatment, for, example, in, the, targeted, alpha, therapy, tat, program, chemically, bismuth, resembles, arsenic, and, antimony, but, is, much, less, toxic, in, almost, all, known, compounds, bismuth, has, oxidation, state, 3, a, few, have, states, 5, or, 3, the, trioxide, and, trisulfide, can, both, be, made, from, the, elements, although, the, trioxide, is, extremely, corrosive, at, high, temperatures, the, pentoxide, is, not, stable, at, room, temperature, and, will, evolve, o, 2, gas, if, heated, both, oxides, form, complex, anions, and, nabio, 3, is, a, strong, oxidising, agent, the, trisulfide, is, common, in, bismuth, ore, similarly, bismuth, forms, all, possible, trihalides, but, the, only, pentahalide, is, bif, 5, all, are, lewis, acids, bismuth, forms, several, formally, bi, i, halides, these, are, complex, salts, with, unusually, structured, polyatomic, cations, and, anions, in, strongly, acidic, aqueous, solution, the, bi, 3, ion, solvates, to, form, bi, h, 2, o, 3, 8, as, ph, increases, the, cations, polymerize, until, the, octahedral, bismuthyl, complex, 6, often, abbreviated, bio, although, bismuth, oxychloride, and, bismuth, oxynitrate, have, stoichiometries, suggesting, the, ion, they, are, double, salts, instead, bismuth, nitrate, not, oxy, nitrate, is, famous, as, one, of, the, few, aqueous, insoluble, nitrate, salts, bismuth, forms, very, few, stable, bismuthides, intermetallic, compounds, in, which, it, attains, oxidation, state, 3, the, hydride, spontaneously, decomposes, at, room, temperature, and, stabilizes, only, below, 60, c, sodium, bismuthide, has, interest, as, a, topological, dirac, insulator, the, reported, abundance, of, bismuth, in, the, earth, s, crust, varies, significantly, by, source, from, 180ppb, similar, to, that, of, silver, to, 8ppb, twice, as, common, as, gold, the, most, important, ores, of, bismuth, are, bismuthinite, and, bismite, native, bismuth, is, known, from, australia, bolivia, and, china, according, to, the, united, states, geological, survey, usgs, 10, 200, tonnes, of, bismuth, were, produced, worldwide, by, mining, and, 17, 100, tonnes, by, refining, in, 2016, since, then, usgs, does, not, provide, mining, data, for, bismuth, considering, them, unreliable, globally, bismuth, is, mostly, produced, by, refining, as, a, byproduct, of, extraction, of, other, metals, such, as, lead, copper, tin, molybdenum, and, tungsten, though, the, refining, to, mining, ratio, depends, on, the, country, bismuth, travels, in, crude, lead, bullion, which, can, contain, up, to, 10, bismuth, through, several, stages, of, refining, until, it, is, removed, by, the, kroll, betterton, process, which, separates, the, impurities, as, slag, or, the, electrolytic, betts, process, bismuth, will, behave, similarly, with, another, of, its, major, metals, copper, the, raw, bismuth, metal, from, both, processes, contains, still, considerable, amounts, of, other, metals, foremost, lead, by, reacting, the, molten, mixture, with, chlorine, gas, the, metals, are, converted, to, their, chlorides, while, bismuth, remains, unchanged, impurities, can, also, be, removed, by, various, other, methods, for, example, with, fluxes, and, treatments, yielding, high, purity, bismuth, metal, over, 99, bi, the, price, for, pure, bismuth, metal, was, relatively, stable, through, most, of, the, 20th, century, except, for, a, spike, in, the, 1970s, bismuth, has, always, been, produced, mainly, as, a, byproduct, of, lead, refining, and, thus, the, price, usually, reflected, the, cost, of, recovery, and, the, balance, between, production, and, demand, before, world, war, ii, demand, for, bismuth, was, small, and, mainly, pharmaceutical, bismuth, compounds, were, used, to, treat, such, conditions, as, digestive, disorders, sexually, transmitted, diseases, and, burns, minor, amounts, of, bismuth, metal, were, consumed, in, fusible, alloys, for, fire, sprinkler, systems, and, fuse, wire, during, world, war, ii, bismuth, was, considered, a, strategic, material, used, for, solders, fusible, alloys, medications, and, atomic, research, to, stabilize, the, market, the, producers, set, the, price, at, 1, 25, per, pound, 2, 75, kg, during, the, war, and, at, 2, 25, per, pound, 4, 96, kg, from, 1950, until, 1964, in, the, early, 1970s, the, price, rose, rapidly, due, to, increasing, demand, for, bismuth, as, a, metallurgical, additive, to, aluminium, iron, and, steel, this, was, followed, by, a, decline, owing, to, increased, world, production, stabilized, consumption, and, the, recessions, of, 1980, and, 1981, 1982, in, 1984, the, price, began, to, climb, as, consumption, increased, worldwide, especially, in, the, united, states, and, japan, in, the, early, 1990s, research, began, on, the, evaluation, of, bismuth, as, a, nontoxic, replacement, for, lead, in, ceramic, glazes, fishing, sinkers, food, processing, equipment, free, machining, brasses, for, plumbing, applications, lubricating, greases, and, shot, for, waterfowl, hunting, growth, in, these, areas, remained, slow, during, the, middle, 1990s, in, spite, of, the, backing, of, lead, replacement, by, the, united, states, federal, government, but, intensified, around, 2005, this, resulted, in, a, rapid, and, continuing, increase, in, price, most, bismuth, is, produced, as, a, byproduct, of, other, metal, extraction, processes, including, the, smelting, of, lead, and, also, of, tungsten, and, copper, its, sustainability, is, dependent, on, increased, recycling, which, is, problematic, it, was, once, believed, that, bismuth, could, be, practically, recycled, from, the, soldered, joints, in, electronic, equipment, recent, efficiencies, in, solder, application, in, electronics, mean, there, is, substantially, less, solder, deposited, and, thus, less, to, recycle, while, recovering, the, silver, from, silver, bearing, solder, may, remain, economic, recovering, bismuth, is, substantially, less, so, dispersed, bismuth, is, used, in, certain, stomach, medicines, bismuth, subsalicylate, paints, bismuth, vanadate, pearlescent, cosmetics, bismuth, oxychloride, and, bismuth, containing, bullets, recycling, bismuth, from, these, uses, is, impractical, bismuth, has, few, commercial, applications, and, those, applications, that, use, it, generally, require, small, quantities, relative, to, other, raw, materials, in, the, united, states, for, example, 733, tonnes, of, bismuth, were, consumed, in, 2016, of, which, 70, went, into, chemicals, including, pharmaceuticals, pigments, and, cosmetics, and, 11, into, bismuth, alloys, in, the, early, 1990s, researchers, began, to, evaluate, bismuth, as, a, nontoxic, replacement, for, lead, in, various, applications, bismuth, is, an, ingredient, in, some, pharmaceuticals, although, the, use, of, some, of, these, substances, is, declining, bismuth, oxychloride, biocl, is, sometimes, used, in, cosmetics, as, a, pigment, in, paint, for, eye, shadows, hair, sprays, and, nail, polishes, this, compound, is, found, as, the, mineral, bismoclite, and, in, crystal, form, contains, layers, of, atoms, see, figure, above, that, refract, light, chromatically, resulting, in, an, iridescent, appearance, similar, to, nacre, of, pearl, it, was, used, as, a, cosmetic, in, ancient, egypt, and, in, many, places, since, bismuth, white, also, spanish, white, can, refer, to, either, bismuth, oxychloride, or, bismuth, oxynitrate, biono, 3, when, used, as, a, white, pigment, bismuth, vanadate, is, used, as, a, light, stable, non, reactive, paint, pigment, particularly, for, artists, paints, often, as, a, replacement, for, the, more, toxic, cadmium, sulfide, yellow, and, orange, yellow, pigments, the, most, common, variety, in, artists, paints, is, a, lemon, yellow, visually, indistinguishable, from, its, cadmium, containing, alternative, bismuth, is, used, in, alloys, with, other, metals, such, as, tin, and, lead, wood, s, metal, an, alloy, of, bismuth, lead, tin, and, cadmium, is, used, in, automatic, sprinkler, systems, for, fires, it, forms, the, largest, part, 50, of, rose, s, metal, a, fusible, alloy, which, also, contains, 25, 28, lead, and, 22, 25, tin, it, was, also, used, to, make, bismuth, bronze, which, was, used, during, the, bronze, age, having, been, found, in, inca, knives, at, machu, picchu, the, density, difference, between, lead, 11, 32, g, cm, 3, and, bismuth, 9, 78, g, cm, 3, is, small, enough, that, for, many, ballistics, and, weighting, applications, bismuth, can, substitute, for, lead, for, example, it, can, replace, lead, as, a, dense, material, in, fishing, sinkers, it, has, been, used, as, a, replacement, for, lead, in, shot, bullets, and, less, lethal, riot, gun, ammunition, the, netherlands, denmark, england, wales, the, united, states, and, many, other, countries, now, prohibit, the, use, of, lead, shot, for, the, hunting, of, wetland, birds, as, many, birds, are, prone, to, lead, poisoning, owing, to, mistaken, ingestion, of, lead, instead, of, small, stones, and, grit, to, aid, digestion, or, even, prohibit, the, use, of, lead, for, all, hunting, such, as, in, the, netherlands, bismuth, tin, alloy, shot, is, one, alternative, that, provides, similar, ballistic, performance, to, lead, bismuth, as, a, dense, element, of, high, atomic, weight, is, used, in, bismuth, impregnated, latex, shields, to, shield, from, x, ray, in, medical, examinations, such, as, cts, mostly, as, it, is, considered, non, toxic, the, european, union, s, restriction, of, hazardous, substances, directive, rohs, for, reduction, of, lead, has, broadened, bismuth, s, use, in, electronics, as, a, component, of, low, melting, point, solders, as, a, replacement, for, traditional, tin, lead, solders, its, low, toxicity, will, be, especially, important, for, solders, to, be, used, in, food, processing, equipment, and, copper, water, pipes, although, it, can, also, be, used, in, other, applications, including, those, in, the, automobile, industry, in, the, european, union, for, example, bismuth, has, been, evaluated, as, a, replacement, for, lead, in, free, machining, brasses, for, plumbing, applications, although, it, does, not, equal, the, performance, of, leaded, steels, many, bismuth, alloys, have, low, melting, points, and, are, found, in, specialty, applications, such, as, solders, many, automatic, sprinklers, electric, fuses, and, safety, devices, in, fire, detection, and, suppression, systems, contain, the, eutectic, in, 19, 1, cd, 5, 3, pb, 22, 6, sn, 8, 3, bi, 44, 7, alloy, that, melts, at, 47, c, 117, f, this, is, a, convenient, temperature, since, it, is, unlikely, to, be, exceeded, in, normal, living, conditions, low, melting, alloys, such, as, bi, cd, pb, sn, alloy, which, melts, at, 70, c, are, also, used, in, automotive, and, aviation, industries, before, deforming, a, thin, walled, metal, part, it, is, filled, with, a, melt, or, covered, with, a, thin, layer, of, the, alloy, to, reduce, the, chance, of, breaking, then, the, alloy, is, removed, by, submerging, the, part, in, boiling, water, bismuth, is, used, to, make, free, machining, steels, and, free, machining, aluminium, alloys, for, precision, machining, properties, it, has, similar, effect, to, lead, and, improves, the, chip, breaking, during, machining, the, shrinking, on, solidification, in, lead, and, the, expansion, of, bismuth, compensate, each, other, and, therefore, lead, and, bismuth, are, often, used, in, similar, quantities, similarly, alloys, containing, comparable, parts, of, bismuth, and, lead, exhibit, a, very, small, change, on, the, order, 0, 01, upon, melting, solidification, or, aging, such, alloys, are, used, in, high, precision, casting, e, g, in, dentistry, to, create, models, and, molds, bismuth, is, also, used, as, an, alloying, agent, in, production, of, malleable, irons, and, as, a, thermocouple, material, bismuth, is, also, used, in, aluminium, silicon, cast, alloys, to, refine, silicon, morphology, however, it, indicated, a, poisoning, effect, on, modification, of, strontium, some, bismuth, alloys, such, as, bi, 35, pb, 37, sn, 25, are, combined, with, non, sticking, materials, such, as, mica, glass, and, enamels, because, they, easily, wet, them, allowing, to, make, joints, to, other, parts, addition, of, bismuth, to, caesium, enhances, the, quantum, yield, of, caesium, cathodes, sintering, of, bismuth, and, manganese, powders, at, 300, c, produces, a, permanent, magnet, and, magnetostrictive, material, which, is, used, in, ultrasonic, generators, and, receivers, working, in, the, 10, 100, khz, range, and, in, magnetic, and, holographic, memory, devices, scientific, literature, indicates, that, some, of, the, compounds, of, bismuth, are, less, toxic, to, humans, via, ingestion, than, other, heavy, metals, lead, arsenic, antimony, etc, presumably, due, to, the, comparatively, low, solubility, of, bismuth, salts, its, biological, half, life, for, whole, body, retention, is, reported, to, be, 5, days, but, it, can, remain, in, the, kidney, for, years, in, people, treated, with, bismuth, compounds, bismuth, poisoning, can, occur, and, has, according, to, some, reports, been, common, in, relatively, recent, times, as, with, lead, bismuth, poisoning, can, result, in, the, formation, of, a, black, deposit, on, the, gingiva, known, as, a, bismuth, line, poisoning, may, be, treated, with, dimercaprol, however, evidence, for, benefit, is, unclear, bismuth, s, environmental, impacts, are, not, well, known, it, may, be, less, likely, to, bioaccumulate, than, some, other, heavy, metals, and, this, is, an, area, of, active, research, this, article, incorporates, text, from, this, source, which, is, in, the, public,
