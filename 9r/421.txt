osmium, from, ancient, greek, osm, smell, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, os, and, atomic, number, 76, it, is, a, hard, brittle, bluish, white, transition, metal, in, the, platinum, group, that, is, found, as, a, trace, element, in, alloys, mostly, in, platinum, ores, osmium, is, the, densest, naturally, occurring, element, when, experimentally, measured, using, x, ray, crystallography, it, has, a, density, of, 22, 59, g, cm, 3, manufacturers, use, its, alloys, with, platinum, iridium, and, other, platinum, group, metals, to, make, fountain, pen, nib, tipping, electrical, contacts, and, in, other, applications, that, require, extreme, durability, and, hardness, osmium, is, among, the, rarest, elements, in, the, earth, s, crust, making, up, only, 50, parts, per, trillion, ppt, osmium, is, a, hard, brittle, blue, gray, metal, and, the, densest, stable, element, about, twice, as, dense, as, lead, the, density, of, osmium, is, slightly, greater, than, that, of, iridium, the, two, are, so, similar, 22, 587, versus, 22, 562, g, cm, 3, at, 20, c, that, each, was, at, one, time, considered, to, be, the, densest, element, only, in, the, 1990s, were, measurements, made, accurately, enough, by, means, of, x, ray, crystallography, to, be, certain, that, osmium, is, the, denser, of, the, two, osmium, has, a, blue, gray, tint, the, reflectivity, of, single, crystals, of, osmium, is, complex, and, strongly, direction, dependent, with, light, in, the, red, and, near, infrared, wavelengths, being, more, strongly, absorbed, when, polarized, parallel, to, the, c, crystal, axis, than, when, polarized, perpendicular, to, the, c, axis, the, c, parallel, polarization, is, also, slightly, more, reflected, in, the, mid, ultraviolet, range, reflectivity, reaches, a, sharp, minimum, at, around, 1, 5, ev, near, infrared, for, the, c, parallel, polarization, and, at, 2, 0, ev, orange, for, the, c, perpendicular, polarization, and, peaks, for, both, in, the, visible, spectrum, at, around, 3, 0, ev, blue, violet, osmium, is, a, hard, but, brittle, metal, that, remains, lustrous, even, at, high, temperatures, it, has, a, very, low, compressibility, correspondingly, its, bulk, modulus, is, extremely, high, reported, between, 395, and, 462, gpa, which, rivals, that, of, diamond, 443, gpa, the, hardness, of, osmium, is, moderately, high, at, 4, gpa, because, of, its, hardness, brittleness, low, vapor, pressure, the, lowest, of, the, platinum, group, metals, and, very, high, melting, point, the, fourth, highest, of, all, elements, after, carbon, tungsten, and, rhenium, solid, osmium, is, difficult, to, machine, form, or, work, osmium, forms, compounds, with, oxidation, states, ranging, from, 4, to, 8, the, most, common, oxidation, states, are, 2, 3, 4, and, 8, the, 8, oxidation, state, is, notable, for, being, the, highest, attained, by, any, chemical, element, aside, from, iridium, s, 9, and, is, encountered, only, in, xenon, ruthenium, hassium, iridium, and, plutonium, the, oxidation, states, 1, and, 2, represented, by, the, two, reactive, compounds, na, 2, and, na, 2, are, used, in, the, synthesis, of, osmium, cluster, compounds, the, most, common, compound, exhibiting, the, 8, oxidation, state, is, osmium, tetroxide, oso, 4, this, toxic, compound, is, formed, when, powdered, osmium, is, exposed, to, air, it, is, a, very, volatile, water, soluble, pale, yellow, crystalline, solid, with, a, strong, smell, osmium, powder, has, the, characteristic, smell, of, osmium, tetroxide, osmium, tetroxide, forms, red, osmates, oso, 4, oh, 2, 2, upon, reaction, with, a, base, with, ammonia, it, forms, the, nitrido, osmates, oso, 3, n, osmium, tetroxide, boils, at, 130, c, and, is, a, powerful, oxidizing, agent, by, contrast, osmium, dioxide, oso, 2, is, black, non, volatile, and, much, less, reactive, and, toxic, only, two, osmium, compounds, have, major, applications, osmium, tetroxide, for, staining, tissue, in, electron, microscopy, and, for, the, oxidation, of, alkenes, in, organic, synthesis, and, the, non, volatile, osmates, for, organic, oxidation, reactions, osmium, pentafluoride, osf, 5, is, known, but, osmium, trifluoride, osf, 3, has, not, yet, been, synthesized, the, lower, oxidation, states, are, stabilized, by, the, larger, halogens, so, that, the, trichloride, tribromide, triiodide, and, even, diiodide, are, known, the, oxidation, state, 1, is, known, only, for, osmium, monoiodide, osi, whereas, several, carbonyl, complexes, of, osmium, such, as, triosmium, dodecacarbonyl, os, 3, co, 12, represent, oxidation, state, 0, in, general, the, lower, oxidation, states, of, osmium, are, stabilized, by, ligands, that, are, good, donors, such, as, amines, and, acceptors, heterocycles, containing, nitrogen, the, higher, oxidation, states, are, stabilized, by, strong, and, donors, such, as, o, 2, and, n, 3, despite, its, broad, range, of, compounds, in, numerous, oxidation, states, osmium, in, bulk, form, at, ordinary, temperatures, and, pressures, is, stable, in, air, it, resists, attack, by, most, acids, and, bases, including, aqua, regia, but, is, attacked, by, f, 2, and, cl, 2, at, high, temperatures, and, by, hot, concentrated, nitric, acid, to, produce, oso, 4, it, can, be, dissolved, by, molten, alkalis, fused, with, an, oxidizer, such, as, sodium, peroxide, na, 2, o, 2, or, potassium, chlorate, kclo, 3, to, give, osmates, such, as, k, 2, osmium, has, seven, naturally, occurring, isotopes, five, of, which, are, stable, 187, os, 188, os, 189, os, 190, os, and, most, abundant, 192, os, at, least, 37, artificial, radioisotopes, and, 20, nuclear, isomers, exist, with, mass, numbers, ranging, from, 160, to, 203, the, most, stable, of, these, is, 194, os, with, a, half, life, of, 6, years, 186, os, undergoes, alpha, decay, with, such, a, long, half, life, 2, 0, 1, 1, 10, 15, years, approximately, 140, 000, times, the, age, of, the, universe, that, for, practical, purposes, it, can, be, considered, stable, 184, os, is, also, known, to, undergo, alpha, decay, with, a, half, life, of, 1, 12, 0, 23, 10, 13, years, alpha, decay, is, predicted, for, all, the, other, naturally, occurring, isotopes, but, this, has, never, been, observed, presumably, due, to, very, long, half, lives, it, is, predicted, that, 184, os, and, 192, os, can, undergo, double, beta, decay, but, this, radioactivity, has, not, been, observed, yet, 189, os, has, a, spin, of, 5, 2, but, 187, os, has, a, nuclear, spin, 1, 2, its, low, natural, abundance, 1, 64, and, low, nuclear, magnetic, moment, means, that, it, is, one, of, the, most, difficult, natural, abundance, isotopes, for, nmr, spectroscopy, 187, os, is, the, descendant, of, 187, re, half, life, 4, 56, 10, 10, years, and, is, used, extensively, in, dating, terrestrial, as, well, as, meteoric, rocks, see, rhenium, osmium, dating, it, has, also, been, used, to, measure, the, intensity, of, continental, weathering, over, geologic, time, and, to, fix, minimum, ages, for, stabilization, of, the, mantle, roots, of, continental, cratons, this, decay, is, a, reason, why, rhenium, rich, minerals, are, abnormally, rich, in, 187, os, however, the, most, notable, application, of, osmium, isotopes, in, geology, has, been, in, conjunction, with, the, abundance, of, iridium, to, characterise, the, layer, of, shocked, quartz, along, the, cretaceous, paleogene, boundary, that, marks, the, extinction, of, the, non, avian, dinosaurs, 65, million, years, ago, osmium, was, discovered, in, 1803, by, smithson, tennant, and, william, hyde, wollaston, in, london, england, the, discovery, of, osmium, is, intertwined, with, that, of, platinum, and, the, other, metals, of, the, platinum, group, platinum, reached, europe, as, platina, small, silver, first, encountered, in, the, late, 17th, century, in, silver, mines, around, the, choc, department, in, colombia, the, discovery, that, this, metal, was, not, an, alloy, but, a, distinct, new, element, was, published, in, 1748, chemists, who, studied, platinum, dissolved, it, in, aqua, regia, a, mixture, of, hydrochloric, and, nitric, acids, to, create, soluble, salts, they, always, observed, a, small, amount, of, a, dark, insoluble, residue, joseph, louis, proust, thought, that, the, residue, was, graphite, victor, collet, descotils, antoine, fran, ois, comte, de, fourcroy, and, louis, nicolas, vauquelin, also, observed, iridium, in, the, black, platinum, residue, in, 1803, but, did, not, obtain, enough, material, for, further, experiments, later, the, two, french, chemists, fourcroy, and, vauquelin, identified, a, metal, in, a, platinum, residue, they, called, pt, ne, in, 1803, smithson, tennant, analyzed, the, insoluble, residue, and, concluded, that, it, must, contain, a, new, metal, vauquelin, treated, the, powder, alternately, with, alkali, and, acids, and, obtained, a, volatile, new, oxide, which, he, believed, was, of, this, new, metal, which, he, named, ptene, from, the, greek, word, pt, nos, for, winged, however, tennant, who, had, the, advantage, of, a, much, larger, amount, of, residue, continued, his, research, and, identified, two, previously, undiscovered, elements, in, the, black, residue, iridium, and, osmium, he, obtained, a, yellow, solution, probably, of, cis, 2, by, reactions, with, sodium, hydroxide, at, red, heat, after, acidification, he, was, able, to, distill, the, formed, oso, 4, he, named, it, osmium, after, greek, osme, meaning, a, smell, because, of, the, chlorine, like, and, slightly, garlic, like, smell, of, the, volatile, osmium, tetroxide, discovery, of, the, new, elements, was, documented, in, a, letter, to, the, royal, society, on, june, 21, 1804, uranium, and, osmium, were, early, successful, catalysts, in, the, haber, process, the, nitrogen, fixation, reaction, of, nitrogen, and, hydrogen, to, produce, ammonia, giving, enough, yield, to, make, the, process, economically, successful, at, the, time, a, group, at, basf, led, by, carl, bosch, bought, most, of, the, world, s, supply, of, osmium, to, use, as, a, catalyst, shortly, thereafter, in, 1908, cheaper, catalysts, based, on, iron, and, iron, oxides, were, introduced, by, the, same, group, for, the, first, pilot, plants, removing, the, need, for, the, expensive, and, rare, osmium, osmium, is, now, obtained, primarily, from, the, processing, of, platinum, and, nickel, ores, osmium, is, one, of, the, least, abundant, stable, elements, in, earth, s, crust, with, an, average, mass, fraction, of, 50, parts, per, trillion, in, the, continental, crust, osmium, is, found, in, nature, as, an, uncombined, element, or, in, natural, alloys, especially, the, iridium, osmium, alloys, osmiridium, iridium, rich, and, iridosmium, osmium, rich, in, nickel, and, copper, deposits, the, platinum, group, metals, occur, as, sulfides, i, e, pt, pd, s, tellurides, e, g, ptbite, antimonides, e, g, pdsb, and, arsenides, e, g, ptas, 2, in, all, these, compounds, platinum, is, exchanged, by, a, small, amount, of, iridium, and, osmium, as, with, all, of, the, platinum, group, metals, osmium, can, be, found, naturally, in, alloys, with, nickel, or, copper, within, earth, s, crust, osmium, like, iridium, is, found, at, highest, concentrations, in, three, types, of, geologic, structure, igneous, deposits, crustal, intrusions, from, below, impact, craters, and, deposits, reworked, from, one, of, the, former, structures, the, largest, known, primary, reserves, are, in, the, bushveld, igneous, complex, in, south, africa, though, the, large, copper, nickel, deposits, near, norilsk, in, russia, and, the, sudbury, basin, in, canada, are, also, significant, sources, of, osmium, smaller, reserves, can, be, found, in, the, united, states, the, alluvial, deposits, used, by, pre, columbian, people, in, the, choc, department, colombia, are, still, a, source, for, platinum, group, metals, the, second, large, alluvial, deposit, was, found, in, the, ural, mountains, russia, which, is, still, mined, osmium, is, obtained, commercially, as, a, by, product, from, nickel, and, copper, mining, and, processing, during, electrorefining, of, copper, and, nickel, noble, metals, such, as, silver, gold, and, the, platinum, group, metals, together, with, non, metallic, elements, such, as, selenium, and, tellurium, settle, to, the, bottom, of, the, cell, as, anode, mud, which, forms, the, starting, material, for, their, extraction, separating, the, metals, requires, that, they, first, be, brought, into, solution, several, methods, can, achieve, this, depending, on, the, separation, process, and, the, composition, of, the, mixture, two, representative, methods, are, fusion, with, sodium, peroxide, followed, by, dissolution, in, aqua, regia, and, dissolution, in, a, mixture, of, chlorine, with, hydrochloric, acid, osmium, ruthenium, rhodium, and, iridium, can, be, separated, from, platinum, gold, and, base, metals, by, their, insolubility, in, aqua, regia, leaving, a, solid, residue, rhodium, can, be, separated, from, the, residue, by, treatment, with, molten, sodium, bisulfate, the, insoluble, residue, containing, ruthenium, osmium, and, iridium, is, treated, with, sodium, oxide, in, which, ir, is, insoluble, producing, water, soluble, ruthenium, and, osmium, salts, after, oxidation, to, the, volatile, oxides, ruo, 4, is, separated, from, oso, 4, by, precipitation, of, nh, 4, 3, rucl, 6, with, ammonium, chloride, after, it, is, dissolved, osmium, is, separated, from, the, other, platinum, group, metals, by, distillation, or, extraction, with, organic, solvents, of, the, volatile, osmium, tetroxide, the, first, method, is, similar, to, the, procedure, used, by, tennant, and, wollaston, both, methods, are, suitable, for, industrial, scale, production, in, either, case, the, product, is, reduced, using, hydrogen, yielding, the, metal, as, a, powder, or, sponge, that, can, be, treated, using, powder, metallurgy, techniques, estimates, of, annual, worldwide, osmium, production, are, on, the, order, of, several, hundred, to, a, few, thousand, kilograms, production, and, consumption, figures, for, osmium, are, not, well, reported, because, demand, for, the, metal, is, limited, and, can, be, fulfilled, with, the, byproducts, of, other, refining, processes, to, reflect, this, statistics, often, report, osmium, with, other, minor, platinum, group, metals, such, as, iridium, and, ruthenium, us, imports, of, osmium, from, 2014, to, 2021, averaged, 155, kg, annually, because, osmium, is, virtually, unforgeable, when, fully, dense, and, very, fragile, when, sintered, it, is, rarely, used, in, its, pure, state, but, is, instead, often, alloyed, with, other, metals, for, high, wear, applications, osmium, alloys, such, as, osmiridium, are, very, hard, and, along, with, other, platinum, group, metals, are, used, in, the, tips, of, fountain, pens, instrument, pivots, and, electrical, contacts, as, they, can, resist, wear, from, frequent, operation, they, were, also, used, for, the, tips, of, phonograph, styli, during, the, late, 78, rpm, and, early, lp, and, 45, record, era, circa, 1945, to, 1955, osmium, alloy, tips, were, significantly, more, durable, than, steel, and, chromium, needle, points, but, wore, out, far, more, rapidly, than, competing, and, costlier, sapphire, and, diamond, tips, so, they, were, discontinued, osmium, tetroxide, has, been, used, in, fingerprint, detection, and, in, staining, fatty, tissue, for, optical, and, electron, microscopy, as, a, strong, oxidant, it, cross, links, lipids, mainly, by, reacting, with, unsaturated, carbon, carbon, bonds, and, thereby, both, fixes, biological, membranes, in, place, in, tissue, samples, and, simultaneously, stains, them, because, osmium, atoms, are, extremely, electron, dense, osmium, staining, greatly, enhances, image, contrast, in, transmission, electron, microscopy, tem, studies, of, biological, materials, those, carbon, materials, otherwise, have, very, weak, tem, contrast, another, osmium, compound, osmium, ferricyanide, osfecn, exhibits, similar, fixing, and, staining, action, the, tetroxide, and, its, derivative, potassium, osmate, are, important, oxidants, in, organic, synthesis, for, the, sharpless, asymmetric, dihydroxylation, which, uses, osmate, for, the, conversion, of, a, double, bond, into, a, vicinal, diol, karl, barry, sharpless, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, in, 2001, oso, 4, is, very, expensive, for, this, use, so, kmno, 4, is, often, used, instead, even, though, the, yields, are, less, for, this, cheaper, chemical, reagent, in, 1898, the, austrian, chemist, auer, von, welsbach, developed, the, oslamp, with, a, filament, made, of, osmium, which, he, introduced, commercially, in, 1902, after, only, a, few, years, osmium, was, replaced, by, tungsten, which, is, more, abundant, and, thus, cheaper, and, more, stable, tungsten, has, the, highest, melting, point, among, all, metals, and, its, use, in, light, bulbs, increases, the, luminous, efficacy, and, life, of, incandescent, lamps, the, light, bulb, manufacturer, osram, founded, in, 1906, when, three, german, companies, auer, gesellschaft, aeg, and, siemens, halske, combined, their, lamp, production, facilities, derived, its, name, from, the, elements, of, os, mium, and, wolf, ram, the, latter, is, german, for, tungsten, like, palladium, powdered, osmium, effectively, absorbs, hydrogen, atoms, this, could, make, osmium, a, potential, candidate, for, a, metal, hydride, battery, electrode, however, osmium, is, expensive, and, would, react, with, potassium, hydroxide, the, most, common, battery, electrolyte, osmium, has, high, reflectivity, in, the, ultraviolet, range, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, for, example, at, 600, osmium, has, a, reflectivity, twice, that, of, gold, this, high, reflectivity, is, desirable, in, space, based, uv, spectrometers, which, have, reduced, mirror, sizes, due, to, space, limitations, osmium, coated, mirrors, were, flown, in, several, space, missions, aboard, the, space, shuttle, but, it, soon, became, clear, that, the, oxygen, radicals, in, low, earth, orbit, are, abundant, enough, to, significantly, deteriorate, the, osmium, layer, the, primary, hazard, of, metallic, osmium, is, the, potential, formation, of, osmium, tetroxide, oso, 4, which, is, volatile, and, very, poisonous, this, reaction, is, thermodynamically, favorable, at, room, temperature, but, the, rate, depends, on, temperature, and, the, surface, area, of, the, metal, as, a, result, bulk, material, is, not, considered, hazardous, while, powders, react, quickly, enough, that, samples, can, sometimes, smell, like, oso, 4, if, they, are, handled, in, air, between, 1990, and, 2010, the, nominal, price, of, osmium, metal, was, almost, constant, while, inflation, reduced, the, real, value, from, us, 950, ounce, to, us, 600, ounce, because, osmium, has, few, commercial, applications, it, is, not, heavily, traded, and, prices, are, seldom, reported
