ivory, is, a, hard, white, material, from, the, tusks, traditionally, from, elephants, and, teeth, of, animals, that, consists, mainly, of, dentine, one, of, the, physical, structures, of, teeth, and, tusks, the, chemical, structure, of, the, teeth, and, tusks, of, mammals, is, the, same, regardless, of, the, species, of, origin, but, ivory, contains, structures, of, mineralised, collagen, the, trade, in, certain, teeth, and, tusks, other, than, elephant, is, well, established, and, widespread, therefore, ivory, can, correctly, be, used, to, describe, any, mammalian, teeth, or, tusks, of, commercial, interest, which, are, large, enough, to, be, carved, or, scrimshawed, besides, natural, ivory, ivory, can, also, be, produced, synthetically, hence, unlike, natural, ivory, not, requiring, the, retrieval, of, the, material, from, animals, tagua, nuts, can, also, be, carved, like, ivory, the, trade, of, finished, goods, of, ivory, products, has, its, origins, in, the, indus, valley, ivory, is, a, main, product, that, is, seen, in, abundance, and, was, used, for, trading, in, harappan, civilization, finished, ivory, products, that, were, seen, in, harappan, sites, include, kohl, sticks, pins, awls, hooks, toggles, combs, game, pieces, dice, inlay, and, other, personal, ornaments, ivory, has, been, valued, since, ancient, times, in, art, or, manufacturing, for, making, a, range, of, items, from, ivory, carvings, to, false, teeth, piano, keys, fans, and, dominoes, elephant, ivory, is, the, most, important, source, but, ivory, from, mammoth, walrus, hippopotamus, sperm, whale, orca, narwhal, and, warthog, are, used, as, well, elk, also, have, two, ivory, teeth, which, are, believed, to, be, the, remnants, of, tusks, from, their, ancestors, the, national, and, international, trade, in, natural, ivory, of, threatened, species, such, as, african, and, asian, elephants, is, illegal, the, word, ivory, ultimately, derives, from, the, ancient, egyptian, b, bu, elephant, through, the, latin, ebor, or, ebur, both, the, greek, and, roman, civilizations, practiced, ivory, carving, to, make, large, quantities, of, high, value, works, of, art, precious, religious, objects, and, decorative, boxes, for, costly, objects, ivory, was, often, used, to, form, the, white, of, the, eyes, of, statues, there, is, some, evidence, of, either, whale, or, walrus, ivory, used, by, the, ancient, irish, solinus, a, roman, writer, in, the, 3rd, century, claimed, that, the, celtic, peoples, in, ireland, would, decorate, their, sword, hilts, with, the, teeth, of, beasts, that, swim, in, the, sea, adomnan, of, iona, wrote, a, story, about, st, columba, giving, a, sword, decorated, with, carved, ivory, as, a, gift, that, a, penitent, would, bring, to, his, master, so, he, could, redeem, himself, from, slavery, the, syrian, and, north, african, elephant, populations, were, reduced, to, extinction, probably, due, to, the, demand, for, ivory, in, the, classical, world, the, chinese, have, long, valued, ivory, for, both, art, and, utilitarian, objects, early, reference, to, the, chinese, export, of, ivory, is, recorded, after, the, chinese, explorer, zhang, qian, ventured, to, the, west, to, form, alliances, to, enable, the, eventual, free, movement, of, chinese, goods, to, the, west, as, early, as, the, first, century, bc, ivory, was, moved, along, the, northern, silk, road, for, consumption, by, western, nations, southeast, asian, kingdoms, included, tusks, of, the, indian, elephant, in, their, annual, tribute, caravans, to, china, chinese, craftsmen, carved, ivory, to, make, everything, from, images, of, deities, to, the, pipe, stems, and, end, pieces, of, opium, pipes, in, japan, ivory, carvings, became, popular, in, the, 17th, century, during, the, edo, period, and, many, netsuke, and, kiseru, on, which, animals, and, legendary, creatures, were, carved, and, inro, on, which, ivory, was, inlaid, were, made, from, the, mid, 1800s, the, new, meiji, government, s, policy, of, promoting, and, exporting, arts, and, crafts, led, to, the, frequent, display, of, elaborate, ivory, crafts, at, world, s, fair, among, them, the, best, works, were, admired, because, they, were, purchased, by, western, museums, wealthy, people, and, the, japanese, imperial, family, the, buddhist, cultures, of, southeast, asia, including, myanmar, thailand, laos, and, cambodia, traditionally, harvested, ivory, from, their, domesticated, elephants, ivory, was, prized, for, containers, due, to, its, ability, to, keep, an, airtight, seal, it, was, also, commonly, carved, into, elaborate, seals, utilized, by, officials, to, sign, documents, and, decrees, by, stamping, them, with, their, unique, official, seal, in, southeast, asian, countries, where, muslim, malay, peoples, live, such, as, malaysia, indonesia, and, the, philippines, ivory, was, the, material, of, choice, for, making, the, handles, of, kris, daggers, in, the, philippines, ivory, was, also, used, to, craft, the, faces, and, hands, of, catholic, icons, and, images, of, saints, prevalent, in, the, santero, culture, tooth, and, tusk, ivory, can, be, carved, into, a, vast, variety, of, shapes, and, objects, examples, of, modern, carved, ivory, objects, are, okimono, netsukes, jewelry, flatware, handles, furniture, inlays, and, piano, keys, additionally, warthog, tusks, and, teeth, from, sperm, whales, orcas, and, hippos, can, also, be, scrimshawed, or, superficially, carved, thus, retaining, their, morphologically, recognizable, shapes, as, trade, with, africa, expanded, during, the, first, part, of, the, 1800s, ivory, became, readily, available, up, to, 90, percent, of, the, ivory, imported, into, the, united, states, was, processed, at, one, time, in, connecticut, where, deep, river, and, ivoryton, in, 1860s, became, the, centers, of, ivory, milling, in, particular, due, to, the, demand, for, ivory, piano, keys, ivory, usage, in, the, last, thirty, years, has, moved, towards, mass, production, of, souvenirs, and, jewelry, in, japan, the, increase, in, wealth, sparked, consumption, of, solid, ivory, hanko, name, seals, which, before, this, time, had, been, made, of, wood, these, hanko, can, be, carved, out, in, a, matter, of, seconds, using, machinery, and, were, partly, responsible, for, massive, african, elephant, decline, in, the, 1980s, when, the, african, elephant, population, went, from, 1, 3, million, to, around, 600, 000, in, ten, years, before, plastics, were, introduced, ivory, had, many, ornamental, and, practical, uses, mainly, because, of, the, white, color, it, presents, when, processed, it, was, formerly, used, to, make, cutlery, handles, billiard, balls, piano, keys, scottish, bagpipes, buttons, and, a, wide, range, of, ornamental, items, synthetic, substitutes, for, ivory, in, the, use, of, most, of, these, items, have, been, developed, since, 1800, the, billiard, industry, challenged, inventors, to, come, up, with, an, alternative, material, that, could, be, manufactured, 17, the, piano, industry, abandoned, ivory, as, a, key, covering, material, in, the, 1970s, ivory, can, be, taken, from, dead, animals, however, most, ivory, came, from, elephants, that, were, killed, for, their, tusks, for, example, in, 1930, to, acquire, 40, tons, of, ivory, required, the, killing, of, approximately, 700, elephants, other, animals, which, are, now, endangered, were, also, preyed, upon, for, example, hippos, which, have, very, hard, white, ivory, prized, for, making, artificial, teeth, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, kenyan, elephant, herds, were, devastated, because, of, demand, for, ivory, to, be, used, for, piano, keys, during, the, art, deco, era, from, 1912, to, 1940, dozens, if, not, hundreds, of, european, artists, used, ivory, in, the, production, of, chryselephantine, statues, two, of, the, most, frequent, users, of, ivory, in, their, sculptured, artworks, were, ferdinand, preiss, and, claire, colinet, while, many, uses, of, ivory, are, purely, ornamental, in, nature, it, often, must, be, carved, and, manipulated, into, different, shapes, to, achieve, the, desired, form, other, applications, such, as, ivory, piano, keys, introduce, repeated, wear, and, surface, handling, of, the, material, it, is, therefore, essential, to, consider, the, mechanical, properties, of, ivory, when, designing, alternatives, elephant, tusks, are, the, animal, s, incisors, so, the, composition, of, ivory, is, unsurprisingly, similar, to, that, of, teeth, in, several, other, mammals, it, is, composed, of, dentine, a, biomineral, composite, constructed, from, collagen, fibers, mineralized, with, hydroxyapatite, this, composite, lends, ivory, the, impressive, mechanical, properties, high, stiffness, strength, hardness, and, toughness, required, for, its, use, in, the, animal, s, day, to, day, activities, ivory, has, a, measured, hardness, of, 35, on, the, vickers, scale, exceeding, that, of, bone, it, also, has, a, flexural, modulus, of, 14, gpa, a, flexural, strength, of, 378, mpa, a, fracture, toughness, of, 2, 05, mpam, 1, 2, these, measured, values, indicate, that, ivory, mechanically, outperforms, most, of, its, most, common, alternatives, including, celluloid, plastic, and, polyethylene, terephthalate, ivory, s, mechanical, properties, result, from, the, microstructure, of, the, dentine, tissue, it, is, thought, that, the, structural, arrangement, of, mineralized, collagen, fibers, could, contribute, to, the, checkerboard, like, schreger, pattern, observed, in, polished, ivory, samples, this, is, often, used, as, an, attribute, in, ivory, identification, as, well, as, being, an, optical, feature, the, schreger, pattern, could, point, towards, a, micropattern, well, designed, to, prevent, crack, propagation, by, dispersing, stresses, additionally, this, intricate, microstructure, lends, a, strong, anisotropy, to, ivory, s, mechanical, characteristics, separate, hardness, measurements, on, three, orthogonal, tusk, directions, indicated, that, circumferential, planes, of, tusk, had, up, to, 25, greater, hardness, than, radial, planes, of, the, same, specimen, during, hardness, testing, inelastic, and, elastic, recovery, was, observed, on, circumferential, planes, while, the, radial, planes, displayed, plastic, deformation, this, implies, that, ivory, has, directional, viscoelasticity, these, anisotropic, properties, can, be, explained, by, the, reinforcement, of, collagen, fibers, in, the, composite, oriented, along, the, circumference, owing, to, the, rapid, decline, in, the, populations, of, the, animals, that, produce, it, the, importation, and, sale, of, ivory, in, many, countries, is, banned, or, severely, restricted, in, the, ten, years, preceding, a, decision, in, 1989, by, cites, to, ban, international, trade, in, african, elephant, ivory, the, population, of, african, elephants, declined, from, 1, 3, million, to, around, 600, 000, it, was, found, by, investigators, from, the, environmental, investigation, agency, eia, that, cites, sales, of, stockpiles, from, singapore, and, burundi, 270, tonnes, and, 89, 5, tonnes, respectively, had, created, a, system, that, increased, the, value, of, ivory, on, the, international, market, thus, rewarding, international, smugglers, and, giving, them, the, ability, to, control, the, trade, and, continue, smuggling, new, ivory, since, the, ivory, ban, some, southern, african, countries, have, claimed, their, elephant, populations, are, stable, or, increasing, and, argued, that, ivory, sales, would, support, their, conservation, efforts, other, african, countries, oppose, this, position, stating, that, renewed, ivory, trading, puts, their, own, elephant, populations, under, greater, threat, from, poachers, reacting, to, demand, cites, allowed, the, sale, of, 49, tonnes, of, ivory, from, zimbabwe, namibia, and, botswana, in, 1997, to, japan, in, 2007, under, pressure, from, the, international, fund, for, animal, welfare, ebay, banned, all, international, sales, of, elephant, ivory, products, the, decision, came, after, several, mass, slaughters, of, african, elephants, most, notably, the, 2006, zakouma, elephant, slaughter, in, chad, the, ifaw, found, that, up, to, 90, of, the, elephant, ivory, transactions, on, ebay, violated, their, own, wildlife, policies, and, could, potentially, be, illegal, in, october, 2008, ebay, expanded, the, ban, disallowing, any, sales, of, ivory, on, ebay, a, more, recent, sale, in, 2008, of, 108, tonnes, from, the, three, countries, and, south, africa, took, place, to, japan, and, china, the, inclusion, of, china, as, an, approved, importing, country, created, enormous, controversy, despite, being, supported, by, cites, the, world, wide, fund, for, nature, and, traffic, they, argued, that, china, had, controls, in, place, and, the, sale, might, depress, prices, however, the, price, of, ivory, in, china, has, skyrocketed, some, believe, this, may, be, due, to, deliberate, price, fixing, by, those, who, bought, the, stockpile, echoing, the, warnings, from, the, japan, wildlife, conservation, society, on, price, fixing, after, sales, to, japan, in, 1997, and, monopoly, given, to, traders, who, bought, stockpiles, from, burundi, and, singapore, in, the, 1980s, a, 2019, peer, reviewed, study, reported, that, the, rate, of, african, elephant, poaching, was, in, decline, with, the, annual, poaching, mortality, rate, peaking, at, over, 10, in, 2011, and, falling, to, below, 4, by, 2017, the, study, found, that, the, annual, poaching, rates, in, 53, sites, strongly, correlate, with, proxies, of, ivory, demand, in, the, main, chinese, markets, whereas, between, country, and, between, site, variation, is, strongly, associated, with, indicators, of, corruption, and, poverty, based, on, these, findings, the, study, authors, recommended, action, to, both, reduce, demand, for, ivory, in, china, and, other, main, markets, and, to, decrease, corruption, and, poverty, in, africa, in, 2006, nineteen, african, countries, signed, the, accra, declaration, calling, for, a, total, ivory, trade, ban, and, twenty, range, states, attended, a, meeting, in, kenya, calling, for, a, 20, year, moratorium, in, 2007, methods, of, obtaining, ivory, can, be, divided, into, the, use, and, trade, of, elephant, ivory, have, become, controversial, because, they, have, contributed, to, seriously, declining, elephant, populations, in, many, countries, it, is, estimated, that, consumption, in, great, britain, alone, in, 1831, amounted, to, the, deaths, of, nearly, 4, 000, elephants, in, 1975, the, asian, elephant, was, placed, on, appendix, i, of, the, convention, on, international, trade, in, endangered, species, cites, which, prevents, international, trade, between, member, states, of, species, that, are, threatened, by, trade, the, african, elephant, was, placed, on, appendix, i, in, january, 1990, since, then, some, southern, african, countries, have, had, their, populations, of, elephants, downlisted, to, appendix, ii, allowing, the, domestic, trade, of, non, ivory, items, there, have, also, been, two, one, off, sales, of, ivory, stockpiles, in, june, 2015, more, than, a, ton, of, confiscated, ivory, was, crushed, in, new, york, city, s, times, square, by, the, wildlife, conservation, society, to, send, a, message, that, the, illegal, trade, will, not, be, tolerated, the, ivory, confiscated, in, new, york, and, philadelphia, was, sent, up, a, conveyor, belt, into, a, rock, crusher, the, wildlife, conservation, society, has, pointed, out, that, the, global, ivory, trade, leads, to, the, slaughter, of, up, to, 35, 000, elephants, a, year, in, africa, in, june, 2018, conservative, meps, deputy, leader, jacqueline, foster, mep, urged, the, eu, to, follow, the, uk, s, lead, and, introduce, a, tougher, ivory, ban, across, europe, china, was, the, biggest, market, for, poached, ivory, but, announced, they, would, phase, out, the, legal, domestic, manufacture, and, sale, of, ivory, products, in, may, 2015, in, september, of, the, same, year, china, and, the, u, s, announced, they, would, enact, a, nearly, complete, ban, on, the, import, and, export, of, ivory, the, chinese, market, has, a, high, degree, of, influence, on, the, elephant, population, trade, in, the, ivory, from, the, tusks, of, dead, woolly, mammoths, frozen, in, the, tundra, has, occurred, for, 300, years, and, continues, to, be, legal, mammoth, ivory, is, used, today, to, make, handcrafted, knives, and, similar, implements, mammoth, ivory, is, rare, and, costly, because, mammoths, have, been, extinct, for, millennia, and, scientists, are, hesitant, to, sell, museum, worthy, specimens, in, pieces, some, estimates, suggest, that, 10, or, more, million, mammoths, are, still, buried, in, siberia, fossil, walrus, ivory, from, animals, that, died, before, 1972, is, legal, to, buy, and, sell, in, the, united, states, unlike, many, other, types, of, ivory, the, ancestors, of, elk, had, teeth, also, known, as, elk, ivory, that, protruded, outwards, similar, to, animals, that, have, tusks, they, were, used, as, a, protective, measure, against, predators, alongside, the, use, of, protective, measures, the, tusks, were, used, during, the, mating, season, to, be, used, for, dominance, as, their, antlers, were, smaller, back, then, compared, to, now, evolution, made, the, antlers, bigger, and, the, use, of, their, tusks, diminished, as, antlers, grew, making, them, nothing, more, than, teeth, in, their, mouths, these, teeth, have, the, same, chemical, compound, as, the, ivory, found, in, the, highly, used, and, poached, elephant, tusks, making, it, another, good, alternative, when, it, comes, to, taking, ivory, as, the, teeth, can, be, possibly, removed, without, harming, the, elk, themselves, among, indian, tribes, elk, teeth, has, major, significance, when, it, comes, to, jewelry, among, women, men, wore, them, as, well, either, through, bracelets, earrings, and, chokers, there, was, deeper, meaning, for, both, men, and, women, within, the, tribes, for, the, women, it, was, believed, that, it, would, bring, in, good, luck, and, good, health, as, for, the, men, it, was, seen, that, they, were, a, good, hunter, ivory, can, also, be, produced, synthetically, a, species, of, hard, nut, is, gaining, popularity, as, a, replacement, for, ivory, although, its, size, limits, its, usability, it, is, sometimes, called, vegetable, ivory, or, tagua, and, is, the, seed, endosperm, of, the, ivory, nut, palm, commonly, found, in, coastal, rainforests, of, ecuador, peru, and, colombia
