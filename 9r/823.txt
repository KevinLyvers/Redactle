in, physics, mass, energy, equivalence, is, the, relationship, between, mass, and, energy, in, a, system, s, rest, frame, where, the, two, quantities, differ, only, by, a, multiplicative, constant, and, the, units, of, measurement, the, principle, is, described, by, the, physicist, albert, einstein, s, formula, e, m, c, 2, displaystyle, e, mc, 2, in, a, reference, frame, where, the, system, is, moving, its, relativistic, energy, and, relativistic, mass, instead, of, rest, mass, obey, the, same, formula, the, formula, defines, the, energy, e, of, a, particle, in, its, rest, frame, as, the, product, of, mass, m, with, the, speed, of, light, squared, c, 2, because, the, speed, of, light, is, a, large, number, in, everyday, units, approximately, 300, 000, km, s, or, 186, 000, mi, s, the, formula, implies, that, a, small, amount, of, rest, mass, measured, when, the, system, is, at, rest, corresponds, to, an, enormous, amount, of, energy, which, is, independent, of, the, composition, of, the, matter, rest, mass, also, called, invariant, mass, is, a, fundamental, physical, property, that, is, independent, of, momentum, even, at, extreme, speeds, approaching, the, speed, of, light, its, value, is, the, same, in, all, inertial, frames, of, reference, massless, particles, such, as, photons, have, zero, invariant, mass, but, massless, free, particles, have, both, momentum, and, energy, the, equivalence, principle, implies, that, when, mass, is, lost, in, chemical, reactions, or, nuclear, reactions, a, corresponding, amount, of, energy, will, be, released, the, energy, can, be, released, to, the, environment, outside, of, the, system, being, considered, as, radiant, energy, such, as, light, or, as, thermal, energy, the, principle, is, fundamental, to, many, fields, of, physics, including, nuclear, and, particle, physics, mass, energy, equivalence, arose, from, special, relativity, as, a, paradox, described, by, the, french, polymath, henri, poincar, 1854, 1912, einstein, was, the, first, to, propose, the, equivalence, of, mass, and, energy, as, a, general, principle, and, a, consequence, of, the, symmetries, of, space, and, time, the, principle, first, appeared, in, does, the, inertia, of, a, body, depend, upon, its, energy, content, one, of, his, annus, mirabilis, papers, published, on, 21, november, 1905, the, formula, and, its, relationship, to, momentum, as, described, by, the, energy, momentum, relation, were, later, developed, by, other, physicists, mass, energy, equivalence, states, that, all, objects, having, mass, or, massive, objects, have, a, corresponding, intrinsic, energy, even, when, they, are, stationary, in, the, rest, frame, of, an, object, where, by, definition, it, is, motionless, and, so, has, no, momentum, the, mass, and, energy, are, equal, or, they, differ, only, by, a, constant, factor, the, speed, of, light, squared, c, 2, in, newtonian, mechanics, a, motionless, body, has, no, kinetic, energy, and, it, may, or, may, not, have, other, amounts, of, internal, stored, energy, like, chemical, energy, or, thermal, energy, in, addition, to, any, potential, energy, it, may, have, from, its, position, in, a, field, of, force, these, energies, tend, to, be, much, smaller, than, the, mass, of, the, object, multiplied, by, c, 2, which, is, on, the, order, of, 10, 17, joules, for, a, mass, of, one, kilogram, due, to, this, principle, the, mass, of, the, atoms, that, come, out, of, a, nuclear, reaction, is, less, than, the, mass, of, the, atoms, that, go, in, and, the, difference, in, mass, shows, up, as, heat, and, light, with, the, same, equivalent, energy, as, the, difference, in, analyzing, these, extreme, events, einstein, s, formula, can, be, used, with, e, as, the, energy, released, removed, and, m, as, the, change, in, mass, in, relativity, all, the, energy, that, moves, with, an, object, i, e, the, energy, as, measured, in, the, object, s, rest, frame, contributes, to, the, total, mass, of, the, body, which, measures, how, much, it, resists, acceleration, if, an, isolated, box, of, ideal, mirrors, could, contain, light, the, individually, massless, photons, would, contribute, to, the, total, mass, of, the, box, by, the, amount, equal, to, their, energy, divided, by, c, 2, for, an, observer, in, the, rest, frame, removing, energy, is, the, same, as, removing, mass, and, the, formula, m, e, c, 2, indicates, how, much, mass, is, lost, when, energy, is, removed, in, the, same, way, when, any, energy, is, added, to, an, isolated, system, the, increase, in, the, mass, is, equal, to, the, added, energy, divided, by, c, 2, an, object, moves, at, different, speeds, in, different, frames, of, reference, depending, on, the, motion, of, the, observer, this, implies, the, kinetic, energy, in, both, newtonian, mechanics, and, relativity, is, frame, dependent, so, that, the, amount, of, relativistic, energy, that, an, object, is, measured, to, have, depends, on, the, observer, the, relativistic, mass, of, an, object, is, given, by, the, relativistic, energy, divided, by, c, 2, because, the, relativistic, mass, is, exactly, proportional, to, the, relativistic, energy, relativistic, mass, and, relativistic, energy, are, nearly, synonymous, the, only, difference, between, them, is, the, units, the, rest, mass, or, invariant, mass, of, an, object, is, defined, as, the, mass, an, object, has, in, its, rest, frame, when, it, is, not, moving, with, respect, to, the, observer, physicists, typically, use, the, term, mass, though, experiments, have, shown, an, object, s, gravitational, mass, depends, on, its, total, energy, and, not, just, its, rest, mass, the, rest, mass, is, the, same, for, all, inertial, frames, as, it, is, independent, of, the, motion, of, the, observer, it, is, the, smallest, possible, value, of, the, relativistic, mass, of, the, object, because, of, the, attraction, between, components, of, a, system, which, results, in, potential, energy, the, rest, mass, is, almost, never, additive, in, general, the, mass, of, an, object, is, not, the, sum, of, the, masses, of, its, parts, the, rest, mass, of, an, object, is, the, total, energy, of, all, the, parts, including, kinetic, energy, as, observed, from, the, center, of, momentum, frame, and, potential, energy, the, masses, add, up, only, if, the, constituents, are, at, rest, as, observed, from, the, center, of, momentum, frame, and, do, not, attract, or, repel, so, that, they, do, not, have, any, extra, kinetic, or, potential, energy, massless, particles, are, particles, with, no, rest, mass, and, therefore, have, no, intrinsic, energy, their, energy, is, due, only, to, their, momentum, relativistic, mass, depends, on, the, motion, of, the, object, so, that, different, observers, in, relative, motion, see, different, values, for, it, the, relativistic, mass, of, a, moving, object, is, larger, than, the, relativistic, mass, of, an, object, at, rest, because, a, moving, object, has, kinetic, energy, if, the, object, moves, slowly, the, relativistic, mass, is, nearly, equal, to, the, rest, mass, and, both, are, nearly, equal, to, the, classical, inertial, mass, as, it, appears, in, newton, s, laws, of, motion, if, the, object, moves, quickly, the, relativistic, mass, is, greater, than, the, rest, mass, by, an, amount, equal, to, the, mass, associated, with, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, object, massless, particles, also, have, relativistic, mass, derived, from, their, kinetic, energy, equal, to, their, relativistic, energy, divided, by, c, 2, or, m, rel, e, c, 2, the, speed, of, light, is, one, in, a, system, where, length, and, time, are, measured, in, natural, units, and, the, relativistic, mass, and, energy, would, be, equal, in, value, and, dimension, as, it, is, just, another, name, for, the, energy, the, use, of, the, term, relativistic, mass, is, redundant, and, physicists, generally, reserve, mass, to, refer, to, rest, mass, or, invariant, mass, as, opposed, to, relativistic, mass, a, consequence, of, this, terminology, is, that, the, mass, is, not, conserved, in, special, relativity, whereas, the, conservation, of, momentum, and, conservation, of, energy, are, both, fundamental, laws, conservation, of, energy, is, a, universal, principle, in, physics, and, holds, for, any, interaction, along, with, the, conservation, of, momentum, the, classical, conservation, of, mass, in, contrast, is, violated, in, certain, relativistic, settings, this, concept, has, been, experimentally, proven, in, a, number, of, ways, including, the, conversion, of, mass, into, kinetic, energy, in, nuclear, reactions, and, other, interactions, between, elementary, particles, while, modern, physics, has, discarded, the, expression, conservation, of, mass, in, older, terminology, a, relativistic, mass, can, also, be, defined, to, be, equivalent, to, the, energy, of, a, moving, system, allowing, for, a, conservation, of, relativistic, mass, mass, conservation, breaks, down, when, the, energy, associated, with, the, mass, of, a, particle, is, converted, into, other, forms, of, energy, such, as, kinetic, energy, thermal, energy, or, radiant, energy, massless, particles, have, zero, rest, mass, the, planck, einstein, relation, for, the, energy, for, photons, is, given, by, the, equation, e, hf, where, h, is, the, planck, constant, and, f, is, the, photon, frequency, this, frequency, and, thus, the, relativistic, energy, are, frame, dependent, if, an, observer, runs, away, from, a, photon, in, the, direction, the, photon, travels, from, a, source, and, it, catches, up, with, the, observer, the, observer, sees, it, as, having, less, energy, than, it, had, at, the, source, the, faster, the, observer, is, traveling, with, regard, to, the, source, when, the, photon, catches, up, the, less, energy, the, photon, would, be, seen, to, have, as, an, observer, approaches, the, speed, of, light, with, regard, to, the, source, the, redshift, of, the, photon, increases, according, to, the, relativistic, doppler, effect, the, energy, of, the, photon, is, reduced, and, as, the, wavelength, becomes, arbitrarily, large, the, photon, s, energy, approaches, zero, because, of, the, massless, nature, of, photons, which, does, not, permit, any, intrinsic, energy, for, closed, systems, made, up, of, many, parts, like, an, atomic, nucleus, planet, or, star, the, relativistic, energy, is, given, by, the, sum, of, the, relativistic, energies, of, each, of, the, parts, because, energies, are, additive, in, these, systems, if, a, system, is, bound, by, attractive, forces, and, the, energy, gained, in, excess, of, the, work, done, is, removed, from, the, system, then, mass, is, lost, with, this, removed, energy, the, mass, of, an, atomic, nucleus, is, less, than, the, total, mass, of, the, protons, and, neutrons, that, make, it, up, this, mass, decrease, is, also, equivalent, to, the, energy, required, to, break, up, the, nucleus, into, individual, protons, and, neutrons, this, effect, can, be, understood, by, looking, at, the, potential, energy, of, the, individual, components, the, individual, particles, have, a, force, attracting, them, together, and, forcing, them, apart, increases, the, potential, energy, of, the, particles, in, the, same, way, that, lifting, an, object, up, on, earth, does, this, energy, is, equal, to, the, work, required, to, split, the, particles, apart, the, mass, of, the, solar, system, is, slightly, less, than, the, sum, of, its, individual, masses, for, an, isolated, system, of, particles, moving, in, different, directions, the, invariant, mass, of, the, system, is, the, analog, of, the, rest, mass, and, is, the, same, for, all, observers, even, those, in, relative, motion, it, is, defined, as, the, total, energy, divided, by, c, 2, in, the, center, of, momentum, frame, the, center, of, momentum, frame, is, defined, so, that, the, system, has, zero, total, momentum, the, term, center, of, mass, frame, is, also, sometimes, used, where, the, center, of, mass, frame, is, a, special, case, of, the, center, of, momentum, frame, where, the, center, of, mass, is, put, at, the, origin, a, simple, example, of, an, object, with, moving, parts, but, zero, total, momentum, is, a, container, of, gas, in, this, case, the, mass, of, the, container, is, given, by, its, total, energy, including, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, gas, molecules, since, the, system, s, total, energy, and, invariant, mass, are, the, same, in, any, reference, frame, where, the, momentum, is, zero, and, such, a, reference, frame, is, also, the, only, frame, in, which, the, object, can, be, weighed, in, a, similar, way, the, theory, of, special, relativity, posits, that, the, thermal, energy, in, all, objects, including, solids, contributes, to, their, total, masses, even, though, this, energy, is, present, as, the, kinetic, and, potential, energies, of, the, atoms, in, the, object, and, it, in, a, similar, way, to, the, gas, is, not, seen, in, the, rest, masses, of, the, atoms, that, make, up, the, object, similarly, even, photons, if, trapped, in, an, isolated, container, would, contribute, their, energy, to, the, mass, of, the, container, such, extra, mass, in, theory, could, be, weighed, in, the, same, way, as, any, other, type, of, rest, mass, even, though, individually, photons, have, no, rest, mass, the, property, that, trapped, energy, in, any, form, adds, weighable, mass, to, systems, that, have, no, net, momentum, is, one, of, the, consequences, of, relativity, it, has, no, counterpart, in, classical, newtonian, physics, where, energy, never, exhibits, weighable, mass, physics, has, two, concepts, of, mass, the, gravitational, mass, and, the, inertial, mass, the, gravitational, mass, is, the, quantity, that, determines, the, strength, of, the, gravitational, field, generated, by, an, object, as, well, as, the, gravitational, force, acting, on, the, object, when, it, is, immersed, in, a, gravitational, field, produced, by, other, bodies, the, inertial, mass, on, the, other, hand, quantifies, how, much, an, object, accelerates, if, a, given, force, is, applied, to, it, the, mass, energy, equivalence, in, special, relativity, refers, to, the, inertial, mass, however, already, in, the, context, of, newtonian, gravity, the, weak, equivalence, principle, is, postulated, the, gravitational, and, the, inertial, mass, of, every, object, are, the, same, thus, the, mass, energy, equivalence, combined, with, the, weak, equivalence, principle, results, in, the, prediction, that, all, forms, of, energy, contribute, to, the, gravitational, field, generated, by, an, object, this, observation, is, one, of, the, pillars, of, the, general, theory, of, relativity, the, prediction, that, all, forms, of, energy, interact, gravitationally, has, been, subject, to, experimental, tests, one, of, the, first, observations, testing, this, prediction, called, the, eddington, experiment, was, made, during, the, solar, eclipse, of, may, 29, 1919, during, the, solar, eclipse, the, english, astronomer, and, physicist, arthur, eddington, observed, that, the, light, from, stars, passing, close, to, the, sun, was, bent, the, effect, is, due, to, the, gravitational, attraction, of, light, by, the, sun, the, observation, confirmed, that, the, energy, carried, by, light, indeed, is, equivalent, to, a, gravitational, mass, another, seminal, experiment, the, pound, rebka, experiment, was, performed, in, 1960, in, this, test, a, beam, of, light, was, emitted, from, the, top, of, a, tower, and, detected, at, the, bottom, the, frequency, of, the, light, detected, was, higher, than, the, light, emitted, this, result, confirms, that, the, energy, of, photons, increases, when, they, fall, in, the, gravitational, field, of, the, earth, the, energy, and, therefore, the, gravitational, mass, of, photons, is, proportional, to, their, frequency, as, stated, by, the, planck, s, relation, in, some, reactions, matter, particles, can, be, destroyed, and, their, associated, energy, released, to, the, environment, as, other, forms, of, energy, such, as, light, and, heat, one, example, of, such, a, conversion, takes, place, in, elementary, particle, interactions, where, the, rest, energy, is, transformed, into, kinetic, energy, such, conversions, between, types, of, energy, happen, in, nuclear, weapons, in, which, the, protons, and, neutrons, in, atomic, nuclei, lose, a, small, fraction, of, their, original, mass, though, the, mass, lost, is, not, due, to, the, destruction, of, any, smaller, constituents, nuclear, fission, allows, a, tiny, fraction, of, the, energy, associated, with, the, mass, to, be, converted, into, usable, energy, such, as, radiation, in, the, decay, of, the, uranium, for, instance, about, 0, 1, of, the, mass, of, the, original, atom, is, lost, in, theory, it, should, be, possible, to, destroy, matter, and, convert, all, of, the, rest, energy, associated, with, matter, into, heat, and, light, but, none, of, the, theoretically, known, methods, are, practical, one, way, to, harness, all, the, energy, associated, with, mass, is, to, annihilate, matter, with, antimatter, antimatter, is, rare, in, the, universe, however, and, the, known, mechanisms, of, production, require, more, usable, energy, than, would, be, released, in, annihilation, cern, estimated, in, 2011, that, over, a, billion, times, more, energy, is, required, to, make, and, store, antimatter, than, could, be, released, in, its, annihilation, as, most, of, the, mass, which, comprises, ordinary, objects, resides, in, protons, and, neutrons, converting, all, the, energy, of, ordinary, matter, into, more, useful, forms, requires, that, the, protons, and, neutrons, be, converted, to, lighter, particles, or, particles, with, no, mass, at, all, in, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, the, number, of, protons, plus, neutrons, is, nearly, exactly, conserved, despite, this, gerard, t, hooft, showed, that, there, is, a, process, that, converts, protons, and, neutrons, to, antielectrons, and, neutrinos, this, is, the, weak, su, 2, instanton, proposed, by, the, physicists, alexander, belavin, alexander, markovich, polyakov, albert, schwarz, and, yu, s, tyupkin, this, process, can, in, principle, destroy, matter, and, convert, all, the, energy, of, matter, into, neutrinos, and, usable, energy, but, it, is, normally, extraordinarily, slow, it, was, later, shown, that, the, process, occurs, rapidly, at, extremely, high, temperatures, that, would, only, have, been, reached, shortly, after, the, big, bang, many, extensions, of, the, standard, model, contain, magnetic, monopoles, and, in, some, models, of, grand, unification, these, monopoles, catalyze, proton, decay, a, process, known, as, the, callan, rubakov, effect, this, process, would, be, an, efficient, mass, energy, conversion, at, ordinary, temperatures, but, it, requires, making, monopoles, and, anti, monopoles, whose, production, is, expected, to, be, inefficient, another, method, of, completely, annihilating, matter, uses, the, gravitational, field, of, black, holes, the, british, theoretical, physicist, stephen, hawking, theorized, it, is, possible, to, throw, matter, into, a, black, hole, and, use, the, emitted, heat, to, generate, power, according, to, the, theory, of, hawking, radiation, however, larger, black, holes, radiate, less, than, smaller, ones, so, that, usable, power, can, only, be, produced, by, small, black, holes, unlike, a, system, s, energy, in, an, inertial, frame, the, relativistic, energy, e, r, e, l, displaystyle, e, rm, rel, of, a, system, depends, on, both, the, rest, mass, m, 0, displaystyle, m, 0, and, the, total, momentum, of, the, system, the, extension, of, einstein, s, equation, to, these, systems, is, given, by, or, e, r, e, l, m, 0, c, 2, 2, p, c, 2, displaystyle, begin, aligned, e, rm, rel, sqrt, m, 0, c, 2, 2, pc, 2, end, aligned, where, the, p, c, 2, displaystyle, pc, 2, term, represents, the, square, of, the, euclidean, norm, total, vector, length, of, the, various, momentum, vectors, in, the, system, which, reduces, to, the, square, of, the, simple, momentum, magnitude, if, only, a, single, particle, is, considered, this, equation, is, called, the, energy, momentum, relation, and, reduces, to, e, r, e, l, m, c, 2, displaystyle, e, rm, rel, mc, 2, when, the, momentum, term, is, zero, for, photons, where, m, 0, 0, displaystyle, m, 0, 0, the, equation, reduces, to, e, r, e, l, p, c, displaystyle, e, rm, rel, pc, using, the, lorentz, factor, the, energy, momentum, can, be, rewritten, as, e, mc, 2, and, expanded, as, a, power, series, for, speeds, much, smaller, than, the, speed, of, light, higher, order, terms, in, this, expression, get, smaller, and, smaller, because, v, c, is, small, for, low, speeds, all, but, the, first, two, terms, can, be, ignored, in, classical, mechanics, both, the, m, 0, c, 2, term, and, the, high, speed, corrections, are, ignored, the, initial, value, of, the, energy, is, arbitrary, as, only, the, change, in, energy, can, be, measured, and, so, the, m, 0, c, 2, term, is, ignored, in, classical, physics, while, the, higher, order, terms, become, important, at, higher, speeds, the, newtonian, equation, is, a, highly, accurate, low, speed, approximation, adding, in, the, third, term, yields, the, difference, between, the, two, approximations, is, given, by, 3, v, 2, 4, c, 2, displaystyle, tfrac, 3v, 2, 4c, 2, a, number, very, small, for, everyday, objects, in, 2018, nasa, announced, the, parker, solar, probe, was, the, fastest, ever, with, a, speed, of, 153, 454, miles, per, hour, 68, 600, m, s, the, difference, between, the, approximations, for, the, parker, solar, probe, in, 2018, is, 3, v, 2, 4, c, 2, 3, 9, 10, 8, displaystyle, tfrac, 3v, 2, 4c, 2, approx, 3, 9, times, 10, 8, which, accounts, for, an, energy, correction, of, four, parts, per, hundred, million, the, gravitational, constant, in, contrast, has, a, standard, relative, uncertainty, of, about, 2, 2, 10, 5, displaystyle, 2, 2, times, 10, 5, the, nuclear, binding, energy, is, the, minimum, energy, that, is, required, to, disassemble, the, nucleus, of, an, atom, into, its, component, parts, the, mass, of, an, atom, is, less, than, the, sum, of, the, masses, of, its, constituents, due, to, the, attraction, of, the, strong, nuclear, force, the, difference, between, the, two, masses, is, called, the, mass, defect, and, is, related, to, the, binding, energy, through, einstein, s, formula, the, principle, is, used, in, modeling, nuclear, fission, reactions, and, it, implies, that, a, great, amount, of, energy, can, be, released, by, the, nuclear, fission, chain, reactions, used, in, both, nuclear, weapons, and, nuclear, power, a, water, molecule, weighs, a, little, less, than, two, free, hydrogen, atoms, and, an, oxygen, atom, the, minuscule, mass, difference, is, the, energy, needed, to, split, the, molecule, into, three, individual, atoms, divided, by, c, 2, which, was, given, off, as, heat, when, the, molecule, formed, this, heat, had, mass, similarly, a, stick, of, dynamite, in, theory, weighs, a, little, bit, more, than, the, fragments, after, the, explosion, in, this, case, the, mass, difference, is, the, energy, and, heat, that, is, released, when, the, dynamite, explodes, such, a, change, in, mass, may, only, happen, when, the, system, is, open, and, the, energy, and, mass, are, allowed, to, escape, thus, if, a, stick, of, dynamite, is, blown, up, in, a, hermetically, sealed, chamber, the, mass, of, the, chamber, and, fragments, the, heat, sound, and, light, would, still, be, equal, to, the, original, mass, of, the, chamber, and, dynamite, if, sitting, on, a, scale, the, weight, and, mass, would, not, change, this, would, in, theory, also, happen, even, with, a, nuclear, bomb, if, it, could, be, kept, in, an, ideal, box, of, infinite, strength, which, did, not, rupture, or, pass, radiation, thus, a, 21, 5, kiloton, 9, 10, 13, joule, nuclear, bomb, produces, about, one, gram, of, heat, and, electromagnetic, radiation, but, the, mass, of, this, energy, would, not, be, detectable, in, an, exploded, bomb, in, an, ideal, box, sitting, on, a, scale, instead, the, contents, of, the, box, would, be, heated, to, millions, of, degrees, without, changing, total, mass, and, weight, if, a, transparent, window, passing, only, electromagnetic, radiation, were, opened, in, such, an, ideal, box, after, the, explosion, and, a, beam, of, x, rays, and, other, lower, energy, light, allowed, to, escape, the, box, it, would, eventually, be, found, to, weigh, one, gram, less, than, it, had, before, the, explosion, this, weight, loss, and, mass, loss, would, happen, as, the, box, was, cooled, by, this, process, to, room, temperature, however, any, surrounding, mass, that, absorbed, the, x, rays, and, other, heat, would, gain, this, gram, of, mass, from, the, resulting, heating, thus, in, this, case, the, mass, loss, would, represent, merely, its, relocation, einstein, used, the, centimetre, gram, second, system, of, units, cgs, but, the, formula, is, independent, of, the, system, of, units, in, natural, units, the, numerical, value, of, the, speed, of, light, is, set, to, equal, 1, and, the, formula, expresses, an, equality, of, numerical, values, e, m, in, the, si, system, expressing, the, ratio, e, m, in, joules, per, kilogram, using, the, value, of, c, in, metres, per, second, so, the, energy, equivalent, of, one, kilogram, of, mass, is, or, the, energy, released, by, combustion, of, the, following, any, time, energy, is, released, the, process, can, be, evaluated, from, an, e, mc, 2, perspective, for, instance, the, gadget, style, bomb, used, in, the, trinity, test, and, the, bombing, of, nagasaki, had, an, explosive, yield, equivalent, to, 21, kt, of, tnt, about, 1, kg, of, the, approximately, 6, 15, kg, of, plutonium, in, each, of, these, bombs, fissioned, into, lighter, elements, totaling, almost, exactly, one, gram, less, after, cooling, the, electromagnetic, radiation, and, kinetic, energy, thermal, and, blast, energy, released, in, this, explosion, carried, the, missing, gram, of, mass, whenever, energy, is, added, to, a, system, the, system, gains, mass, as, shown, when, the, equation, is, rearranged, while, einstein, was, the, first, to, have, correctly, deduced, the, mass, energy, equivalence, formula, he, was, not, the, first, to, have, related, energy, with, mass, though, nearly, all, previous, authors, thought, that, the, energy, that, contributes, to, mass, comes, only, from, electromagnetic, fields, once, discovered, einstein, s, formula, was, initially, written, in, many, different, notations, and, its, interpretation, and, justification, was, further, developed, in, several, steps, eighteenth, century, theories, on, the, correlation, of, mass, and, energy, included, that, devised, by, the, english, scientist, isaac, newton, in, 1717, who, speculated, that, light, particles, and, matter, particles, were, interconvertible, in, query, 30, of, the, opticks, where, he, asks, are, not, the, gross, bodies, and, light, convertible, into, one, another, and, may, not, bodies, receive, much, of, their, activity, from, the, particles, of, light, which, enter, their, composition, swedish, scientist, and, theologian, emanuel, swedenborg, in, his, principia, of, 1734, theorized, that, all, matter, is, ultimately, composed, of, dimensionless, points, of, pure, and, total, motion, he, described, this, motion, as, being, without, force, direction, or, speed, but, having, the, potential, for, force, direction, and, speed, everywhere, within, it, during, the, nineteenth, century, there, were, several, speculative, attempts, to, show, that, mass, and, energy, were, proportional, in, various, ether, theories, in, 1873, the, russian, physicist, and, mathematician, nikolay, umov, pointed, out, a, relation, between, mass, and, energy, for, ether, in, the, form, of, kmc, 2, where, 0, 5, k, 1, the, writings, of, the, english, engineer, samuel, tolver, preston, and, a, 1903, paper, by, the, italian, industrialist, and, geologist, olinto, de, pretto, presented, a, mass, energy, relation, italian, mathematician, and, math, historian, umberto, bartocci, observed, that, there, were, only, three, degrees, of, separation, linking, de, pretto, to, einstein, concluding, that, einstein, was, probably, aware, of, de, pretto, s, work, preston, and, de, pretto, following, physicist, georges, louis, le, sage, imagined, that, the, universe, was, filled, with, an, ether, of, tiny, particles, that, always, move, at, speed, c, each, of, these, particles, has, a, kinetic, energy, of, mc, 2, up, to, a, small, numerical, factor, the, nonrelativistic, kinetic, energy, formula, did, not, always, include, the, traditional, factor, of, 1, 2, since, german, polymath, gottfried, leibniz, introduced, kinetic, energy, without, it, and, the, 1, 2, is, largely, conventional, in, prerelativistic, physics, by, assuming, that, every, particle, has, a, mass, that, is, the, sum, of, the, masses, of, the, ether, particles, the, authors, concluded, that, all, matter, contains, an, amount, of, kinetic, energy, either, given, by, e, mc, 2, or, 2, e, mc, 2, depending, on, the, convention, a, particle, ether, was, usually, considered, unacceptably, speculative, science, at, the, time, and, since, these, authors, did, not, formulate, relativity, their, reasoning, is, completely, different, from, that, of, einstein, who, used, relativity, to, change, frames, in, 1905, independently, of, einstein, french, polymath, gustave, le, bon, speculated, that, atoms, could, release, large, amounts, of, latent, energy, reasoning, from, an, all, encompassing, qualitative, philosophy, of, physics, there, were, many, attempts, in, the, 19th, and, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, like, those, of, british, physicists, j, j, thomson, in, 1881, and, oliver, heaviside, in, 1889, and, george, frederick, charles, searle, in, 1897, german, physicists, wilhelm, wien, in, 1900, and, max, abraham, in, 1902, and, the, dutch, physicist, hendrik, antoon, lorentz, in, 1904, to, understand, how, the, mass, of, a, charged, object, depends, on, the, electrostatic, field, this, concept, was, called, electromagnetic, mass, and, was, considered, as, being, dependent, on, velocity, and, direction, as, well, lorentz, in, 1904, gave, the, following, expressions, for, longitudinal, and, transverse, electromagnetic, mass, where, another, way, of, deriving, a, type, of, electromagnetic, mass, was, based, on, the, concept, of, radiation, pressure, in, 1900, french, polymath, henri, poincar, associated, electromagnetic, radiation, energy, with, a, fictitious, fluid, having, momentum, and, mass, by, that, poincar, tried, to, save, the, center, of, mass, theorem, in, lorentz, s, theory, though, his, treatment, led, to, radiation, paradoxes, austrian, physicist, friedrich, hasen, hrl, showed, in, 1904, that, electromagnetic, cavity, radiation, contributes, the, apparent, mass, to, the, cavity, s, mass, he, argued, that, this, implies, mass, dependence, on, temperature, as, well, einstein, did, not, write, the, exact, formula, e, mc, 2, in, his, 1905, annus, mirabilis, paper, does, the, inertia, of, an, object, depend, upon, its, energy, content, rather, the, paper, states, that, if, a, body, gives, off, the, energy, l, by, emitting, light, its, mass, diminishes, by, l, c, 2, this, formulation, relates, only, a, change, m, in, mass, to, a, change, l, in, energy, without, requiring, the, absolute, relationship, the, relationship, convinced, him, that, mass, and, energy, can, be, seen, as, two, names, for, the, same, underlying, conserved, physical, quantity, he, has, stated, that, the, laws, of, conservation, of, energy, and, conservation, of, mass, are, one, and, the, same, einstein, elaborated, in, a, 1946, essay, that, the, principle, of, the, conservation, of, mass, proved, inadequate, in, the, face, of, the, special, theory, of, relativity, it, was, therefore, merged, with, the, energy, conservation, principle, just, as, about, 60, years, before, the, principle, of, the, conservation, of, mechanical, energy, had, been, combined, with, the, principle, of, the, conservation, of, heat, we, might, say, that, the, principle, of, the, conservation, of, energy, having, previously, swallowed, up, that, of, the, conservation, of, heat, now, proceeded, to, swallow, that, of, the, conservation, of, mass, and, holds, the, field, alone, in, developing, special, relativity, einstein, found, that, the, kinetic, energy, of, a, moving, body, is, with, v, the, velocity, m, 0, the, rest, mass, and, the, lorentz, factor, he, included, the, second, term, on, the, right, to, make, sure, that, for, small, velocities, the, energy, would, be, the, same, as, in, classical, mechanics, thus, satisfying, the, correspondence, principle, without, this, second, term, there, would, be, an, additional, contribution, in, the, energy, when, the, particle, is, not, moving, einstein, following, lorentz, and, abraham, used, velocity, and, direction, dependent, mass, concepts, in, his, 1905, electrodynamics, paper, and, in, another, paper, in, 1906, in, einstein, s, first, 1905, paper, on, e, mc, 2, he, treated, m, as, what, would, now, be, called, the, rest, mass, and, it, has, been, noted, that, in, his, later, years, he, did, not, like, the, idea, of, relativistic, mass, in, older, physics, terminology, relativistic, energy, is, used, in, lieu, of, relativistic, mass, and, the, term, mass, is, reserved, for, the, rest, mass, historically, there, has, been, considerable, debate, over, the, use, of, the, concept, of, relativistic, mass, and, the, connection, of, mass, in, relativity, to, mass, in, newtonian, dynamics, one, view, is, that, only, rest, mass, is, a, viable, concept, and, is, a, property, of, the, particle, while, relativistic, mass, is, a, conglomeration, of, particle, properties, and, properties, of, spacetime, another, view, attributed, to, norwegian, physicist, kjell, v, yenli, is, that, the, newtonian, concept, of, mass, as, a, particle, property, and, the, relativistic, concept, of, mass, have, to, be, viewed, as, embedded, in, their, own, theories, and, as, having, no, precise, connection, already, in, his, relativity, paper, on, the, electrodynamics, of, moving, bodies, einstein, derived, the, correct, expression, for, the, kinetic, energy, of, particles, now, the, question, remained, open, as, to, which, formulation, applies, to, bodies, at, rest, this, was, tackled, by, einstein, in, his, paper, does, the, inertia, of, a, body, depend, upon, its, energy, content, one, of, his, annus, mirabilis, papers, here, einstein, used, v, to, represent, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, and, l, to, represent, the, energy, lost, by, a, body, in, the, form, of, radiation, consequently, the, equation, e, mc, 2, was, not, originally, written, as, a, formula, but, as, a, sentence, in, german, saying, that, if, a, body, gives, off, the, energy, l, in, the, form, of, radiation, its, mass, diminishes, by, l, v, 2, a, remark, placed, above, it, informed, that, the, equation, was, approximated, by, neglecting, magnitudes, of, fourth, and, higher, orders, of, a, series, expansion, einstein, used, a, body, emitting, two, light, pulses, in, opposite, directions, having, energies, of, e, 0, before, and, e, 1, after, the, emission, as, seen, in, its, rest, frame, as, seen, from, a, moving, frame, e, 0, becomes, h, 0, and, e, 1, becomes, h, 1, einstein, obtained, in, modern, notation, he, then, argued, that, h, e, can, only, differ, from, the, kinetic, energy, k, by, an, additive, constant, which, gives, neglecting, effects, higher, than, third, order, in, v, c, after, a, taylor, series, expansion, of, the, right, side, of, this, yields, einstein, concluded, that, the, emission, reduces, the, body, s, mass, by, e, c, 2, and, that, the, mass, of, a, body, is, a, measure, of, its, energy, content, the, correctness, of, einstein, s, 1905, derivation, of, e, mc, 2, was, criticized, by, german, theoretical, physicist, max, planck, in, 1907, who, argued, that, it, is, only, valid, to, first, approximation, another, criticism, was, formulated, by, american, physicist, herbert, ives, in, 1952, and, the, israeli, physicist, max, jammer, in, 1961, asserting, that, einstein, s, derivation, is, based, on, begging, the, question, other, scholars, such, as, american, and, chilean, philosophers, john, stachel, and, roberto, torretti, have, argued, that, ives, criticism, was, wrong, and, that, einstein, s, derivation, was, correct, american, physics, writer, hans, ohanian, in, 2008, agreed, with, stachel, torretti, s, criticism, of, ives, though, he, argued, that, einstein, s, derivation, was, wrong, for, other, reasons, like, poincar, einstein, concluded, in, 1906, that, the, inertia, of, electromagnetic, energy, is, a, necessary, condition, for, the, center, of, mass, theorem, to, hold, on, this, occasion, einstein, referred, to, poincar, s, 1900, paper, and, wrote, although, the, merely, formal, considerations, which, we, will, need, for, the, proof, are, already, mostly, contained, in, a, work, by, h, poincar, 2, for, the, sake, of, clarity, i, will, not, rely, on, that, work, in, einstein, s, more, physical, as, opposed, to, formal, or, mathematical, point, of, view, there, was, no, need, for, fictitious, masses, he, could, avoid, the, perpetual, motion, problem, because, on, the, basis, of, the, mass, energy, equivalence, he, could, show, that, the, transport, of, inertia, that, accompanies, the, emission, and, absorption, of, radiation, solves, the, problem, poincar, s, rejection, of, the, principle, of, action, reaction, can, be, avoided, through, einstein, s, e, mc, 2, because, mass, conservation, appears, as, a, special, case, of, the, energy, conservation, law, there, were, several, further, developments, in, the, first, decade, of, the, twentieth, century, in, may, 1907, einstein, explained, that, the, expression, for, energy, of, a, moving, mass, point, assumes, the, simplest, form, when, its, expression, for, the, state, of, rest, is, chosen, to, be, 0, v, 2, where, is, the, mass, which, is, in, agreement, with, the, principle, of, the, equivalence, of, mass, and, energy, in, addition, einstein, used, the, formula, e, 0, v, 2, with, e, 0, being, the, energy, of, a, system, of, mass, points, to, describe, the, energy, and, mass, increase, of, that, system, when, the, velocity, of, the, differently, moving, mass, points, is, increased, max, planck, rewrote, einstein, s, mass, energy, relationship, as, m, e, 0, pv, 0, c, 2, in, june, 1907, where, p, is, the, pressure, and, v, 0, the, volume, to, express, the, relation, between, mass, its, latent, energy, and, thermodynamic, energy, within, the, body, subsequently, in, october, 1907, this, was, rewritten, as, m, 0, e, 0, c, 2, and, given, a, quantum, interpretation, by, german, physicist, johannes, stark, who, assumed, its, validity, and, correctness, in, december, 1907, einstein, expressed, the, equivalence, in, the, form, m, e, 0, c, 2, and, concluded, a, mass, is, equivalent, as, regards, inertia, to, a, quantity, of, energy, c, 2, it, appears, far, more, natural, to, consider, every, inertial, mass, as, a, store, of, energy, american, physical, chemists, gilbert, n, lewis, and, richard, c, tolman, used, two, variations, of, the, formula, in, 1909, m, e, c, 2, and, m, 0, e, 0, c, 2, with, e, being, the, relativistic, energy, the, energy, of, an, object, when, the, object, is, moving, e, 0, is, the, rest, energy, the, energy, when, not, moving, m, is, the, relativistic, mass, the, rest, mass, and, the, extra, mass, gained, when, moving, and, m, 0, is, the, rest, mass, the, same, relations, in, different, notation, were, used, by, lorentz, in, 1913, and, 1914, though, he, placed, the, energy, on, the, left, hand, side, mc, 2, and, 0, mc, 2, with, being, the, total, energy, rest, energy, plus, kinetic, energy, of, a, moving, material, point, 0, its, rest, energy, m, the, relativistic, mass, and, m, the, invariant, mass, in, 1911, german, physicist, max, von, laue, gave, a, more, comprehensive, proof, of, m, 0, e, 0, c, 2, from, the, stress, energy, tensor, which, was, later, generalized, by, german, mathematician, felix, klein, in, 1918, einstein, returned, to, the, topic, once, again, after, world, war, ii, and, this, time, he, wrote, e, mc, 2, in, the, title, of, his, article, intended, as, an, explanation, for, a, general, reader, by, analogy, an, alternative, version, of, einstein, s, thought, experiment, was, proposed, by, american, theoretical, physicist, fritz, rohrlich, in, 1990, who, based, his, reasoning, on, the, doppler, effect, like, einstein, he, considered, a, body, at, rest, with, mass, m, if, the, body, is, examined, in, a, frame, moving, with, nonrelativistic, velocity, v, it, is, no, longer, at, rest, and, in, the, moving, frame, it, has, momentum, p, mv, then, he, supposed, the, body, emits, two, pulses, of, light, to, the, left, and, to, the, right, each, carrying, an, equal, amount, of, energy, e, 2, in, its, rest, frame, the, object, remains, at, rest, after, the, emission, since, the, two, beams, are, equal, in, strength, and, carry, opposite, momentum, however, if, the, same, process, is, considered, in, a, frame, that, moves, with, velocity, v, to, the, left, the, pulse, moving, to, the, left, is, redshifted, while, the, pulse, moving, to, the, right, is, blue, shifted, the, blue, light, carries, more, momentum, than, the, red, light, so, that, the, momentum, of, the, light, in, the, moving, frame, is, not, balanced, the, light, is, carrying, some, net, momentum, to, the, right, the, object, has, not, changed, its, velocity, before, or, after, the, emission, yet, in, this, frame, it, has, lost, some, right, momentum, to, the, light, the, only, way, it, could, have, lost, momentum, is, by, losing, mass, this, also, solves, poincar, s, radiation, paradox, the, velocity, is, small, so, the, right, moving, light, is, blueshifted, by, an, amount, equal, to, the, nonrelativistic, doppler, shift, factor, 1, v, c, the, momentum, of, the, light, is, its, energy, divided, by, c, and, it, is, increased, by, a, factor, of, v, c, so, the, right, moving, light, is, carrying, an, extra, momentum, p, given, by, the, left, moving, light, carries, a, little, less, momentum, by, the, same, amount, p, so, the, total, right, momentum, in, both, light, pulses, is, twice, p, this, is, the, right, momentum, that, the, object, lost, the, momentum, of, the, object, in, the, moving, frame, after, the, emission, is, reduced, to, this, amount, so, the, change, in, the, object, s, mass, is, equal, to, the, total, energy, lost, divided, by, c, 2, since, any, emission, of, energy, can, be, carried, out, by, a, two, step, process, where, first, the, energy, is, emitted, as, light, and, then, the, light, is, converted, to, some, other, form, of, energy, any, emission, of, energy, is, accompanied, by, a, loss, of, mass, similarly, by, considering, absorption, a, gain, in, energy, is, accompanied, by, a, gain, in, mass, it, was, quickly, noted, after, the, discovery, of, radioactivity, in, 1897, that, the, total, energy, due, to, radioactive, processes, is, about, one, million, times, greater, than, that, involved, in, any, known, molecular, change, raising, the, question, of, where, the, energy, comes, from, after, eliminating, the, idea, of, absorption, and, emission, of, some, sort, of, lesagian, ether, particles, the, existence, of, a, huge, amount, of, latent, energy, stored, within, matter, was, proposed, by, new, zealand, physicist, ernest, rutherford, and, british, radiochemist, frederick, soddy, in, 1903, rutherford, also, suggested, that, this, internal, energy, is, stored, within, normal, matter, as, well, he, went, on, to, speculate, in, 1904, if, it, were, ever, found, possible, to, control, at, will, the, rate, of, disintegration, of, the, radio, elements, an, enormous, amount, of, energy, could, be, obtained, from, a, small, quantity, of, matter, einstein, s, equation, does, not, explain, the, large, energies, released, in, radioactive, decay, but, can, be, used, to, quantify, them, the, theoretical, explanation, for, radioactive, decay, is, given, by, the, nuclear, forces, responsible, for, holding, atoms, together, though, these, forces, were, still, unknown, in, 1905, the, enormous, energy, released, from, radioactive, decay, had, previously, been, measured, by, rutherford, and, was, much, more, easily, measured, than, the, small, change, in, the, gross, mass, of, materials, as, a, result, einstein, s, equation, by, theory, can, give, these, energies, by, measuring, mass, differences, before, and, after, reactions, but, in, practice, these, mass, differences, in, 1905, were, still, too, small, to, be, measured, in, bulk, prior, to, this, the, ease, of, measuring, radioactive, decay, energies, with, a, calorimeter, was, thought, possibly, likely, to, allow, measurement, of, changes, in, mass, difference, as, a, check, on, einstein, s, equation, itself, einstein, mentions, in, his, 1905, paper, that, mass, energy, equivalence, might, perhaps, be, tested, with, radioactive, decay, which, was, known, by, then, to, release, enough, energy, to, possibly, be, weighed, when, missing, from, the, system, however, radioactivity, seemed, to, proceed, at, its, own, unalterable, pace, and, even, when, simple, nuclear, reactions, became, possible, using, proton, bombardment, the, idea, that, these, great, amounts, of, usable, energy, could, be, liberated, at, will, with, any, practicality, proved, difficult, to, substantiate, rutherford, was, reported, in, 1933, to, have, declared, that, this, energy, could, not, be, exploited, efficiently, anyone, who, expects, a, source, of, power, from, the, transformation, of, the, atom, is, talking, moonshine, this, outlook, changed, dramatically, in, 1932, with, the, discovery, of, the, neutron, and, its, mass, allowing, mass, differences, for, single, nuclides, and, their, reactions, to, be, calculated, directly, and, compared, with, the, sum, of, masses, for, the, particles, that, made, up, their, composition, in, 1933, the, energy, released, from, the, reaction, of, lithium, 7, plus, protons, giving, rise, to, two, alpha, particles, allowed, einstein, s, equation, to, be, tested, to, an, error, of, 0, 5, however, scientists, still, did, not, see, such, reactions, as, a, practical, source, of, power, due, to, the, energy, cost, of, accelerating, reaction, particles, after, the, very, public, demonstration, of, huge, energies, released, from, nuclear, fission, after, the, atomic, bombings, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, in, 1945, the, equation, e, mc, 2, became, directly, linked, in, the, public, eye, with, the, power, and, peril, of, nuclear, weapons, the, equation, was, featured, on, page, 2, of, the, smyth, report, the, official, 1945, release, by, the, us, government, on, the, development, of, the, atomic, bomb, and, by, 1946, the, equation, was, linked, closely, enough, with, einstein, s, work, that, the, cover, of, time, magazine, prominently, featured, a, picture, of, einstein, next, to, an, image, of, a, mushroom, cloud, emblazoned, with, the, equation, einstein, himself, had, only, a, minor, role, in, the, manhattan, project, he, had, cosigned, a, letter, to, the, u, s, president, in, 1939, urging, funding, for, research, into, atomic, energy, warning, that, an, atomic, bomb, was, theoretically, possible, the, letter, persuaded, roosevelt, to, devote, a, significant, portion, of, the, wartime, budget, to, atomic, research, without, a, security, clearance, einstein, s, only, scientific, contribution, was, an, analysis, of, an, isotope, separation, method, in, theoretical, terms, it, was, inconsequential, on, account, of, einstein, not, being, given, sufficient, information, to, fully, work, on, the, problem, while, e, mc, 2, is, useful, for, understanding, the, amount, of, energy, potentially, released, in, a, fission, reaction, it, was, not, strictly, necessary, to, develop, the, weapon, once, the, fission, process, was, known, and, its, energy, measured, at, 200, mev, which, was, directly, possible, using, a, quantitative, geiger, counter, at, that, time, the, physicist, and, manhattan, project, participant, robert, serber, noted, that, somehow, the, popular, notion, took, hold, long, ago, that, einstein, s, theory, of, relativity, in, particular, his, equation, e, mc, 2, plays, some, essential, role, in, the, theory, of, fission, einstein, had, a, part, in, alerting, the, united, states, government, to, the, possibility, of, building, an, atomic, bomb, but, his, theory, of, relativity, is, not, required, in, discussing, fission, the, theory, of, fission, is, what, physicists, call, a, non, relativistic, theory, meaning, that, relativistic, effects, are, too, small, to, affect, the, dynamics, of, the, fission, process, significantly, there, are, other, views, on, the, equation, s, importance, to, nuclear, reactions, in, late, 1938, the, austrian, swedish, and, british, physicists, lise, meitner, and, otto, robert, frisch, while, on, a, winter, walk, during, which, they, solved, the, meaning, of, hahn, s, experimental, results, and, introduced, the, idea, that, would, be, called, atomic, fission, directly, used, einstein, s, equation, to, help, them, understand, the, quantitative, energetics, of, the,
