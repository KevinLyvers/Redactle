yellow, is, the, color, between, green, and, orange, on, the, spectrum, of, light, it, is, evoked, by, light, with, a, dominant, wavelength, of, roughly, 575, 585, nm, it, is, a, primary, color, in, subtractive, color, systems, used, in, painting, or, color, printing, in, the, rgb, color, model, used, to, create, colors, on, television, and, computer, screens, yellow, is, a, secondary, color, made, by, combining, red, and, green, at, equal, intensity, carotenoids, give, the, characteristic, yellow, color, to, autumn, leaves, corn, canaries, daffodils, and, lemons, as, well, as, egg, yolks, buttercups, and, bananas, they, absorb, light, energy, and, protect, plants, from, photo, damage, in, some, cases, sunlight, has, a, slight, yellowish, hue, when, the, sun, is, near, the, horizon, due, to, atmospheric, scattering, of, shorter, wavelengths, green, blue, and, violet, because, it, was, widely, available, yellow, ochre, pigment, was, one, of, the, first, colors, used, in, art, the, lascaux, cave, in, france, has, a, painting, of, a, yellow, horse, 17, 000, years, old, ochre, and, orpiment, pigments, were, used, to, represent, gold, and, skin, color, in, egyptian, tombs, then, in, the, murals, in, roman, villas, in, the, early, christian, church, yellow, was, the, color, associated, with, the, pope, and, the, golden, keys, of, the, kingdom, but, it, was, also, associated, with, judas, iscariot, and, used, to, mark, heretics, in, the, 20th, century, jews, in, nazi, occupied, europe, were, forced, to, wear, a, yellow, star, in, china, bright, yellow, was, the, color, of, the, middle, kingdom, and, could, be, worn, only, by, the, emperor, and, his, household, special, guests, were, welcomed, on, a, yellow, carpet, according, to, surveys, in, europe, canada, the, united, states, and, elsewhere, yellow, is, the, color, people, most, often, associate, with, amusement, gentleness, humor, happiness, and, spontaneity, however, it, can, also, be, associated, with, duplicity, envy, jealousy, greed, justice, and, in, the, u, s, cowardice, in, iran, it, has, connotations, of, pallor, sickness, but, also, wisdom, and, connection, in, china, and, many, asian, countries, it, is, seen, as, the, color, of, happiness, glory, harmony, and, wisdom, the, word, yellow, is, from, the, old, english, geolu, geolwe, oblique, case, meaning, yellow, and, yellowish, derived, from, the, proto, germanic, word, gelwaz, yellow, it, has, the, same, indo, european, base, gel, as, the, words, gold, and, yell, g, el, means, both, bright, and, gleaming, and, to, cry, out, the, english, term, is, related, to, other, germanic, words, for, yellow, namely, scots, yella, east, frisian, jeel, west, frisian, giel, dutch, geel, german, gelb, and, swedish, and, norwegian, gul, according, to, the, oxford, english, dictionary, the, oldest, known, use, of, this, word, in, english, is, from, the, epinal, glossary, in, 700, yellow, is, found, between, green, and, red, on, the, spectrum, of, visible, light, it, is, the, color, the, human, eye, sees, when, it, looks, at, light, with, a, dominant, wavelength, between, 570, and, 590, nanometers, in, color, printing, yellow, is, one, of, the, three, subtractive, primary, colors, of, ink, along, with, magenta, and, cyan, together, with, black, they, can, be, overlaid, in, the, right, combination, to, print, any, full, color, image, see, the, cmyk, color, model, a, particular, yellow, is, used, called, process, yellow, also, known, as, pigment, yellow, printer, s, yellow, and, canary, yellow, process, yellow, is, not, an, rgb, color, and, there, is, no, fixed, conversion, from, cmyk, primaries, to, rgb, different, formulations, are, used, for, printer, s, ink, so, there, can, be, variations, in, the, printed, color, that, is, pure, yellow, ink, the, yellow, on, a, color, television, or, computer, screen, is, created, in, a, completely, different, way, by, combining, green, and, red, light, at, the, right, level, of, intensity, see, rgb, color, model, traditionally, the, complementary, color, of, yellow, is, purple, the, two, colors, are, opposite, each, other, on, the, color, wheel, long, used, by, painters, vincent, van, gogh, an, avid, student, of, color, theory, used, combinations, of, yellow, and, purple, in, several, of, his, paintings, for, the, maximum, contrast, and, harmony, hunt, defines, that, two, colors, are, complementary, when, it, is, possible, to, reproduce, the, tristimulus, values, of, a, specified, achromatic, stimulus, by, an, additive, mixture, of, these, two, stimuli, that, is, when, two, colored, lights, can, be, mixed, to, match, a, specified, white, achromatic, non, colored, light, the, colors, of, those, two, lights, are, complementary, this, definition, however, does, not, constrain, what, version, of, white, will, be, specified, in, the, nineteenth, century, the, scientists, grassmann, and, helmholtz, did, experiments, in, which, they, concluded, that, finding, a, good, complement, for, spectral, yellow, was, difficult, but, that, the, result, was, indigo, that, is, a, wavelength, that, today, s, color, scientists, would, call, violet, or, purple, helmholtz, says, yellow, and, indigo, blue, are, complements, grassmann, reconstructs, newton, s, category, boundaries, in, terms, of, wavelengths, and, says, this, indigo, therefore, falls, within, the, limits, of, color, between, which, according, to, helmholtz, the, complementary, colors, of, yellow, lie, newton, s, own, color, circle, has, yellow, directly, opposite, the, boundary, between, indigo, and, violet, these, results, that, the, complement, of, yellow, is, a, wavelength, shorter, than, 450, nm, are, derivable, from, the, modern, cie, 1931, system, of, colorimetry, if, it, is, assumed, that, the, yellow, is, about, 580, nm, or, shorter, wavelength, and, the, specified, white, is, the, color, of, a, blackbody, radiator, of, temperature, 2800, k, or, lower, that, is, the, white, of, an, ordinary, incandescent, light, bulb, more, typically, with, a, daylight, colored, or, around, 5000, to, 6000, k, white, the, complement, of, yellow, will, be, in, the, blue, wavelength, range, which, is, the, standard, modern, answer, for, the, complement, of, yellow, because, of, the, characteristics, of, paint, pigments, and, use, of, different, color, wheels, painters, traditionally, regard, the, complement, of, yellow, as, the, color, indigo, or, blue, violet, lasers, emitting, in, the, yellow, part, of, the, spectrum, are, less, common, and, more, expensive, than, most, other, colors, in, commercial, products, diode, pumped, solid, state, dpss, technology, is, employed, to, create, the, yellow, light, an, infrared, laser, diode, at, 808, nm, is, used, to, pump, a, crystal, of, neodymium, doped, yttrium, vanadium, oxide, nd, yvo4, or, neodymium, doped, yttrium, aluminum, garnet, nd, yag, and, induces, it, to, emit, at, two, frequencies, 281, 76, thz, and, 223, 39, thz, 1064, nm, and, 1342, nm, wavelengths, simultaneously, this, deeper, infrared, light, is, then, passed, through, another, crystal, containing, potassium, titanium, and, phosphorus, ktp, whose, non, linear, properties, generate, light, at, a, frequency, that, is, the, sum, of, the, two, incident, beams, 505, 15, thz, in, this, case, corresponding, to, the, wavelength, of, 593, 5, nm, yellow, this, wavelength, is, also, available, though, even, more, rarely, from, a, helium, neon, laser, however, this, not, a, true, yellow, as, it, exceeds, 590, nm, a, variant, of, this, same, dpss, technology, using, slightly, different, starting, frequencies, was, made, available, in, 2010, producing, a, wavelength, of, 589, nm, which, is, considered, a, true, yellow, color, the, use, of, yellow, lasers, at, 589, nm, and, 594, nm, have, recently, become, more, widespread, thanks, to, the, field, of, optogenetics, stars, of, spectral, classes, f, and, g, have, color, temperatures, that, make, them, look, yellowish, the, first, astronomer, to, classify, stars, according, to, their, color, was, f, g, w, struve, in, 1827, one, of, his, classifications, was, flavae, or, yellow, and, this, roughly, corresponded, to, stars, in, the, modern, spectral, range, f5, to, k0, the, str, mgren, photometric, system, for, stellar, classification, includes, a, y, or, yellow, filter, that, is, centered, at, a, wavelength, of, 550, nm, and, has, a, bandwidth, of, 20, 30, nm, supergiant, stars, are, rarely, yellow, supergiants, because, f, and, g, class, supergiants, are, physically, unstable, they, are, most, often, a, transitional, phase, between, blue, supergiants, and, red, supergiants, some, yellow, supergiants, the, cepheid, variables, pulsate, with, a, period, proportional, to, their, absolute, magnitude, hence, if, their, apparent, magnitude, is, known, the, distance, to, them, can, be, calculated, with, great, precision, cepheid, variables, were, hence, used, to, determine, distances, within, and, beyond, the, milky, way, galaxy, the, most, famous, example, is, the, current, north, pole, star, polaris, autumn, leaves, yellow, flowers, bananas, oranges, and, other, yellow, fruits, all, contain, carotenoids, yellow, and, red, organic, pigments, that, are, found, in, the, chloroplasts, and, chromoplasts, of, plants, and, some, other, photosynthetic, organisms, like, algae, some, bacteria, and, some, fungi, they, serve, two, key, roles, in, plants, and, algae, they, absorb, light, energy, for, use, in, photosynthesis, and, they, protect, the, green, chlorophyll, from, photodamage, in, late, summer, as, daylight, hours, shorten, and, temperatures, cool, the, veins, that, carry, fluids, into, and, out, of, the, leaf, are, gradually, closed, off, the, water, and, mineral, intake, into, the, leaf, is, reduced, slowly, at, first, and, then, more, rapidly, it, is, during, this, time, that, the, chlorophyll, begins, to, decrease, as, the, chlorophyll, diminishes, the, yellow, and, red, carotenoids, become, more, and, more, visible, creating, the, classic, autumn, leaf, color, carotenoids, are, common, in, many, living, things, they, give, the, characteristic, color, to, carrots, maize, daffodils, rutabagas, buttercups, and, bananas, they, are, responsible, for, the, red, of, cooked, lobsters, the, pink, of, flamingoes, and, salmon, and, the, yellow, of, canaries, and, egg, yolks, xanthophylls, are, the, most, common, yellow, pigments, that, form, one, of, two, major, divisions, of, the, carotenoid, group, the, name, is, from, greek, xanthos, yellow, phyllon, leaf, xanthophylls, are, most, commonly, found, in, the, leaves, of, green, plants, but, they, also, find, their, way, into, animals, through, the, food, they, eat, for, example, the, yellow, color, of, chicken, egg, yolks, fat, and, skin, comes, from, the, feed, the, chickens, consume, chicken, farmers, understand, this, and, often, add, xanthophylls, usually, lutein, to, make, the, egg, yolks, more, yellow, bananas, are, green, when, they, are, picked, because, of, the, chlorophyll, their, skin, contains, once, picked, they, begin, to, ripen, hormones, in, the, bananas, convert, amino, acids, into, ethylene, gas, which, stimulates, the, production, of, several, enzymes, these, enzymes, start, to, change, the, color, texture, and, flavor, of, the, banana, the, green, chlorophyll, supply, is, stopped, and, the, yellow, color, of, the, carotenoids, replaces, it, eventually, as, the, enzymes, continue, their, work, the, cell, walls, break, down, and, the, bananas, turn, brown, yellow, in, the, form, of, yellow, ochre, pigment, made, from, clay, was, one, of, the, first, colors, used, in, prehistoric, cave, art, the, cave, of, lascaux, has, an, image, of, a, horse, colored, with, yellow, estimated, to, be, 17, 300, years, old, in, ancient, egypt, yellow, was, associated, with, gold, which, was, considered, to, be, imperishable, eternal, and, indestructible, the, skin, and, bones, of, the, gods, were, believed, to, be, made, of, gold, the, egyptians, used, yellow, extensively, in, tomb, paintings, they, usually, used, either, yellow, ochre, or, the, brilliant, orpiment, though, it, was, made, of, arsenic, and, was, highly, toxic, a, small, paintbox, with, orpiment, pigment, was, found, in, the, tomb, of, king, tutankhamun, men, were, always, shown, with, brown, faces, women, with, yellow, ochre, or, gold, faces, the, ancient, romans, used, yellow, in, their, paintings, to, represent, gold, and, also, in, skin, tones, it, is, found, frequently, in, the, murals, of, pompeii, during, the, post, classical, period, yellow, became, firmly, established, as, the, color, of, judas, iscariot, the, disciple, who, betrayed, jesus, christ, even, though, the, bible, never, describes, his, clothing, from, this, connection, yellow, also, took, on, associations, with, envy, jealousy, and, duplicity, the, tradition, started, in, the, renaissance, of, marking, non, christian, outsiders, such, as, jews, with, the, color, yellow, in, 16th, century, spain, those, accused, of, heresy, and, who, refused, to, renounce, their, views, were, compelled, to, come, before, the, spanish, inquisition, dressed, in, a, yellow, cape, the, color, yellow, has, been, historically, associated, with, moneylenders, and, finance, the, national, pawnbrokers, association, s, logo, depicts, three, golden, spheres, hanging, from, a, bar, referencing, the, three, bags, of, gold, that, the, patron, saint, of, pawnbroking, st, nicholas, holds, in, his, hands, additionally, the, symbol, of, three, golden, orbs, is, found, in, the, coat, of, arms, of, the, house, of, medici, a, famous, fifteenth, century, italian, dynasty, of, bankers, and, lenders, the, 18th, and, 19th, century, saw, the, discovery, and, manufacture, of, synthetic, pigments, and, dyes, which, quickly, replaced, the, traditional, yellows, made, from, arsenic, cow, urine, and, other, substances, c, 1776, jean, honor, fragonard, painted, a, young, girl, reading, she, is, dressed, in, a, bright, saffron, yellow, dress, this, painting, is, considered, by, many, critics, to, be, among, fragonard, s, most, appealing, and, masterly, the, 19th, century, british, painter, j, m, w, turner, was, one, of, the, first, in, that, century, to, use, yellow, to, create, moods, and, emotions, the, way, romantic, composers, were, using, music, his, painting, rain, steam, and, speed, the, great, central, railway, was, dominated, by, glowing, yellow, clouds, georges, seurat, used, the, new, synthetic, colors, in, his, experimental, paintings, composed, of, tiny, points, of, primary, colors, particularly, in, his, famous, sunday, afternoon, on, the, isle, de, la, grand, jatte, 1884, 86, he, did, not, know, that, the, new, synthetic, yellow, pigment, zinc, yellow, or, zinc, chromate, which, he, used, in, the, light, green, lawns, was, highly, unstable, and, would, quickly, turn, brown, the, painter, vincent, van, gogh, was, a, particular, admirer, of, the, color, yellow, the, color, of, sunshine, writing, to, his, sister, from, the, south, of, france, in, 1888, he, wrote, now, we, are, having, beautiful, warm, windless, weather, that, is, very, beneficial, to, me, the, sun, a, light, that, for, lack, of, a, better, word, i, can, only, call, yellow, bright, sulfur, yellow, pale, lemon, gold, how, beautiful, yellow, is, in, arles, van, gogh, painted, sunflowers, inside, a, small, house, he, rented, at, 2, place, lamartine, a, house, painted, with, a, color, that, van, gogh, described, as, buttery, yellow, van, gogh, was, one, of, the, first, artists, to, use, commercially, manufactured, paints, rather, than, paints, he, made, himself, he, used, the, traditional, yellow, ochre, but, also, chrome, yellow, first, made, in, 1809, and, cadmium, yellow, first, made, in, 1820, in, 1895, a, new, popular, art, form, began, to, appear, in, new, york, newspapers, the, color, comic, strip, it, took, advantage, of, a, new, color, printing, process, which, used, color, separation, and, three, different, colors, of, ink, magenta, cyan, and, yellow, plus, black, to, create, all, the, colors, on, the, page, one, of, the, first, characters, in, the, new, comic, strips, was, a, humorous, boy, of, the, new, york, streets, named, mickey, dugen, more, commonly, known, as, the, yellow, kid, from, the, yellow, nightshirt, he, wore, he, gave, his, name, and, color, to, the, whole, genre, of, popular, sensational, journalism, which, became, known, as, yellow, journalism, in, the, 20th, century, yellow, was, revived, as, a, symbol, of, exclusion, as, it, had, been, in, the, middle, ages, and, renaissance, jews, in, nazi, germany, and, german, occupied, countries, were, required, to, sew, yellow, triangles, with, the, star, of, david, onto, their, clothing, in, the, 20th, century, modernist, painters, reduced, painting, to, its, simplest, colors, and, geometric, shapes, the, dutch, modernist, painter, piet, mondrian, made, a, series, of, paintings, which, consisted, of, a, pure, white, canvas, with, a, grid, of, vertical, and, horizontal, black, lines, and, rectangles, of, yellow, red, and, blue, yellow, was, particularly, valued, in, the, 20th, century, because, of, its, high, visibility, because, of, its, ability, to, be, seen, well, from, greater, distances, and, at, high, speeds, yellow, makes, for, the, ideal, color, to, be, viewed, from, moving, automobiles, it, often, replaced, red, as, the, color, of, fire, trucks, and, other, emergency, vehicles, and, was, popular, in, neon, signs, especially, in, las, vegas, and, in, china, where, yellow, was, the, most, esteemed, color, in, the, 1960s, pickett, brand, developed, the, eye, saver, yellow, slide, rule, which, was, produced, with, a, specific, yellow, color, angstrom, 5600, that, reflects, long, wavelength, rays, and, promotes, optimum, eye, ease, to, help, prevent, eyestrain, and, improve, visual, accuracy, the, 21st, century, saw, the, use, of, unusual, materials, and, technologies, to, create, new, ways, of, experiencing, the, color, yellow, one, example, was, the, weather, project, by, danish, icelandic, artist, olafur, eliasson, which, was, installed, in, the, open, space, of, the, turbine, hall, of, london, s, tate, modern, in, 2003, eliasson, used, humidifiers, to, create, a, fine, mist, in, the, air, via, a, mixture, of, sugar, and, water, as, well, as, a, semi, circular, disc, made, up, of, hundreds, of, monochromatic, lamps, which, radiated, yellow, light, the, ceiling, of, the, hall, was, covered, with, a, huge, mirror, in, which, visitors, could, see, themselves, as, tiny, black, shadows, against, a, mass, of, light, many, fruits, are, yellow, when, ripe, such, as, lemons, and, bananas, their, color, derived, from, carotenoid, pigments, egg, yolks, gain, their, color, from, xanthophylls, also, a, type, of, carotenoid, pigment, yellow, is, a, common, color, of, flowers, the, color, of, saffron, comes, from, crocin, a, red, variety, of, carotenoid, natural, pigment, the, color, of, the, dyed, fabric, varies, from, deep, red, to, orange, to, yellow, depending, upon, the, type, of, saffron, and, the, process, most, saffron, today, comes, from, iran, but, it, is, also, grown, commercially, in, spain, italy, and, kashmir, in, india, and, as, a, boutique, crop, in, new, zealand, the, united, kingdom, france, switzerland, and, other, countries, in, the, united, states, it, has, been, cultivated, by, the, pennsylvania, dutch, community, since, the, early, 18th, century, because, of, the, high, price, of, saffron, other, similar, dyes, and, spices, are, often, sold, under, the, name, saffron, for, instance, what, is, called, indian, saffron, is, often, really, turmeric, the, most, common, yellow, food, coloring, in, use, today, is, called, tartrazine, it, is, a, synthetic, lemon, yellow, azo, dye, it, is, also, known, as, e, number, e102, c, i, 19140, fd, c, yellow, 5, acid, yellow, 23, food, yellow, 4, and, trisodium, 1, 4, sulfonatophenyl, 4, 4, sulfonatophenylazo, 5, pyrazolone, 3, carboxylate, it, is, the, yellow, most, frequently, used, such, processed, food, products, as, corn, and, potato, chips, breakfast, cereals, such, as, corn, flakes, candies, popcorn, mustard, jams, and, jellies, gelatin, soft, drinks, notably, mountain, dew, energy, and, sports, drinks, and, pastries, it, is, also, widely, used, in, liquid, and, bar, soap, shampoo, cosmetics, and, medicines, sometimes, it, is, mixed, with, blue, dyes, to, color, processed, products, green, it, is, typically, labelled, on, food, packages, as, color, tartrazine, or, e102, in, the, united, states, because, of, concerns, about, possible, health, problems, related, to, intolerance, to, tartrazine, its, presence, must, be, declared, on, food, and, drug, product, labels, another, popular, synthetic, yellow, coloring, is, sunset, yellow, fcf, also, known, as, orange, yellow, s, fd, c, yellow, 6, and, c, i, 15985, it, is, manufactured, from, aromatic, hydrocarbons, from, petroleum, when, added, to, foods, sold, in, europe, it, is, denoted, by, e, number, e110, in, the, west, yellow, is, not, a, well, loved, color, in, a, year, 2000, survey, only, 6, of, respondents, in, europe, and, america, named, it, as, their, favorite, color, compared, with, 45, for, blue, 15, for, green, 12, for, red, and, 10, for, black, for, 7, of, respondents, it, was, their, least, favorite, color, yellow, is, considered, a, color, of, ambivalence, and, contradiction, it, is, associated, with, optimism, and, amusement, but, also, with, betrayal, duplicity, and, jealousy, however, in, china, and, other, parts, of, asia, yellow, is, a, color, of, virtue, and, nobility, yellow, has, strong, historical, and, cultural, associations, in, china, where, hu, ng, or, is, the, color, of, happiness, glory, and, wisdom, although, hu, ng, originally, and, occasionally, still, covers, a, range, inclusive, of, tans, and, oranges, speakers, of, modern, standard, mandarin, tend, to, map, their, use, of, hu, ng, to, shades, corresponding, to, english, yellow, in, chinese, symbolism, yellow, red, and, green, are, masculine, colors, while, black, and, white, are, considered, feminine, after, the, development, of, the, theory, of, five, elements, the, chinese, reckoned, various, correspondences, on, a, five, season, model, late, summer, was, characterized, by, yellowing, leaves, yellow, was, taken, as, the, color, of, the, fifth, direction, of, the, compass, the, central, china, is, called, the, middle, kingdom, the, palace, of, the, emperor, was, considered, to, be, in, the, exact, center, of, the, world, the, legendary, first, emperor, of, china, was, called, the, yellow, emperor, and, the, last, puyi, 1906, 67, described, in, his, memoirs, how, every, object, which, surrounded, him, as, a, child, was, yellow, it, made, me, understand, from, my, most, tender, age, that, i, was, of, a, unique, essence, and, it, instilled, in, me, the, consciousness, of, my, celestial, nature, which, made, me, different, from, every, other, human, the, chinese, emperor, was, literally, considered, the, child, of, heaven, with, both, a, political, and, religious, role, both, symbolized, by, yellow, after, the, song, dynasty, laws, banned, the, use, of, certain, bright, yellow, shades, by, anyone, but, the, emperor, distinguished, visitors, were, honored, with, a, yellow, not, a, red, carpet, in, current, chinese, pop, culture, the, term, yellow, movie, refers, to, films, and, other, cultural, items, of, a, pornographic, nature, analogous, to, the, english, blue, movie, this, was, the, basis, of, the, 2007, very, erotic, very, violent, meme, with, the, word, erotic, calquing, chinese, yellow, yellow, as, the, color, of, sunlight, when, sun, is, near, the, horizon, is, commonly, associated, with, warmth, yellow, combined, with, red, symbolized, heat, and, energy, a, room, painted, yellow, feels, warmer, than, a, room, painted, white, and, a, lamp, with, yellow, light, seems, more, natural, than, a, lamp, with, white, light, as, the, color, of, light, yellow, is, also, associated, with, knowledge, and, wisdom, in, english, and, many, other, languages, brilliant, and, bright, mean, intelligent, in, islam, the, yellow, color, of, gold, symbolizes, wisdom, in, medieval, european, symbolism, red, symbolized, passion, blue, symbolized, the, spiritual, and, yellow, symbolized, reason, in, many, european, universities, yellow, gowns, and, caps, are, worn, by, members, of, the, faculty, of, physical, and, natural, sciences, as, yellow, is, the, color, of, reason, and, research, in, ancient, greece, and, rome, the, gods, were, often, depicted, with, yellow, or, blonde, hair, which, was, described, in, literature, as, golden, the, color, yellow, was, associated, with, the, sun, gods, helios, and, apollo, it, was, fashionable, in, ancient, greece, for, men, and, women, to, dye, their, hair, yellow, or, to, spend, time, in, the, sun, to, bleach, it, in,
