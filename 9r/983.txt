rotation, or, rotational, motion, is, the, circular, movement, of, an, object, around, a, central, line, known, as, an, axis, of, rotation, a, plane, figure, can, rotate, in, either, a, clockwise, or, counterclockwise, sense, around, a, perpendicular, axis, intersecting, anywhere, inside, or, outside, the, figure, at, a, center, of, rotation, a, solid, figure, has, an, infinite, number, of, possible, axes, and, angles, of, rotation, including, chaotic, rotation, between, arbitrary, orientations, in, contrast, to, rotation, around, a, fixed, axis, the, special, case, of, a, rotation, with, an, internal, axis, passing, through, the, body, s, own, center, of, mass, is, known, as, a, spin, or, autorotation, in, that, case, the, surface, intersection, of, the, internal, spin, axis, can, be, called, a, pole, for, example, earth, s, rotation, defines, the, geographical, poles, a, rotation, around, an, axis, completely, external, to, the, moving, body, is, called, a, revolution, or, orbit, e, g, earth, s, orbit, around, the, sun, the, ends, of, the, external, axis, of, revolution, can, be, called, the, orbital, poles, either, type, of, rotation, is, involved, in, a, corresponding, type, of, angular, velocity, spin, angular, velocity, and, orbital, angular, velocity, and, angular, momentum, spin, angular, momentum, and, orbital, angular, momentum, mathematically, a, rotation, is, a, rigid, body, movement, which, unlike, a, translation, keeps, at, least, one, point, fixed, this, definition, applies, to, rotations, in, two, dimensions, in, a, plane, in, which, exactly, one, point, is, kept, fixed, and, also, in, three, dimensions, in, space, in, which, additional, points, may, be, kept, fixed, as, in, rotation, around, a, fixed, axis, as, infinite, line, all, rigid, body, movements, are, rotations, translations, or, combinations, of, the, two, a, rotation, is, simply, a, progressive, radial, orientation, to, a, common, point, that, common, point, lies, within, the, axis, of, that, motion, the, axis, is, perpendicular, to, the, plane, of, the, motion, if, a, rotation, around, a, point, or, axis, is, followed, by, a, second, rotation, around, the, same, point, axis, a, third, rotation, results, the, reverse, inverse, of, a, rotation, is, also, a, rotation, thus, the, rotations, around, a, point, axis, form, a, group, however, a, rotation, around, a, point, or, axis, and, a, rotation, around, a, different, point, axis, may, result, in, something, other, than, a, rotation, e, g, a, translation, rotations, around, the, x, y, and, z, axes, are, called, principal, rotations, rotation, around, any, axis, can, be, performed, by, taking, a, rotation, around, the, x, axis, followed, by, a, rotation, around, the, y, axis, and, followed, by, a, rotation, around, the, z, axis, that, is, to, say, any, spatial, rotation, can, be, decomposed, into, a, combination, of, principal, rotations, the, combination, of, any, sequence, of, rotations, of, an, object, in, three, dimensions, about, a, fixed, point, is, always, equivalent, to, a, rotation, about, an, axis, which, may, be, considered, to, be, a, rotation, in, the, plane, that, is, perpendicular, to, that, axis, similarly, the, rotation, rate, of, an, object, in, three, dimensions, at, any, instant, is, about, some, axis, although, this, axis, may, be, changing, over, time, in, other, than, three, dimensions, it, does, not, make, sense, to, describe, a, rotation, as, being, around, an, axis, since, more, than, one, axis, through, the, object, may, be, kept, fixed, instead, simple, rotations, are, described, as, being, in, a, plane, in, four, or, more, dimensions, a, combination, of, two, or, more, rotations, about, in, a, plane, is, not, in, general, a, rotation, in, a, single, plane, 2, dimensional, rotations, unlike, the, 3, dimensional, ones, possess, no, axis, of, rotation, only, a, point, about, which, the, rotation, occurs, this, is, equivalent, for, linear, transformations, with, saying, that, there, is, no, direction, in, the, plane, which, is, kept, unchanged, by, a, 2, dimensional, rotation, except, of, course, the, identity, the, question, of, the, existence, of, such, a, direction, is, the, question, of, existence, of, an, eigenvector, for, the, matrix, a, representing, the, rotation, every, 2d, rotation, around, the, origin, through, an, angle, displaystyle, theta, in, counterclockwise, direction, can, be, quite, simply, represented, by, the, following, matrix, a, standard, eigenvalue, determination, leads, to, the, characteristic, equation, which, has, as, its, eigenvalues, therefore, there, is, no, real, eigenvalue, whenever, cos, 1, displaystyle, cos, theta, neq, pm, 1, meaning, that, no, real, vector, in, the, plane, is, kept, unchanged, by, a, knowing, that, the, trace, is, an, invariant, the, rotation, angle, displaystyle, alpha, for, a, proper, orthogonal, 3, 3, rotation, matrix, a, displaystyle, a, is, found, by, using, the, principal, arc, cosine, this, formula, gives, a, rotation, angle, satisfying, 0, 180, displaystyle, 0, leq, alpha, leq, 180, circ, the, corresponding, rotation, axis, must, be, defined, to, point, in, a, direction, that, limits, the, rotation, angle, to, not, exceed, 180, degrees, this, can, always, be, done, because, any, rotation, of, more, than, 180, degrees, about, an, axis, m, displaystyle, m, can, always, be, written, as, a, rotation, having, 0, 180, displaystyle, 0, leq, alpha, leq, 180, circ, if, the, axis, is, replaced, with, n, m, displaystyle, n, m, every, proper, rotation, a, displaystyle, a, in, 3d, space, has, an, axis, of, rotation, which, is, defined, such, that, any, vector, v, displaystyle, v, that, is, aligned, with, the, rotation, axis, will, not, be, affected, by, rotation, accordingly, a, v, v, displaystyle, av, v, and, the, rotation, axis, therefore, corresponds, to, an, eigenvector, of, the, rotation, matrix, associated, with, an, eigenvalue, of, 1, as, long, as, the, rotation, angle, displaystyle, alpha, is, nonzero, i, e, the, rotation, is, not, the, identity, tensor, there, is, one, and, only, one, such, direction, because, a, has, only, real, components, there, is, at, least, one, real, eigenvalue, and, the, remaining, two, eigenvalues, must, be, complex, conjugates, of, each, other, see, eigenvalues, and, eigenvectors, eigenvalues, and, the, characteristic, polynomial, knowing, that, 1, is, an, eigenvalue, it, follows, that, the, remaining, two, eigenvalues, are, complex, conjugates, of, each, other, but, this, does, not, imply, that, they, are, complex, they, could, be, real, with, double, multiplicity, in, the, degenerate, case, of, a, rotation, angle, 180, displaystyle, alpha, 180, circ, the, remaining, two, eigenvalues, are, both, equal, to, 1, in, the, degenerate, case, of, a, zero, rotation, angle, the, rotation, matrix, is, the, identity, and, all, three, eigenvalues, are, 1, which, is, the, only, case, for, which, the, rotation, axis, is, arbitrary, a, spectral, analysis, is, not, required, to, find, the, rotation, axis, if, n, displaystyle, n, denotes, the, unit, eigenvector, aligned, with, the, rotation, axis, and, if, displaystyle, alpha, denotes, the, rotation, angle, then, it, can, be, shown, that, 2, sin, n, a, 32, a, 23, a, 13, a, 31, a, 21, a, 12, displaystyle, 2, sin, alpha, n, a, 32, a, 23, a, 13, a, 31, a, 21, a, 12, consequently, the, expense, of, an, eigenvalue, analysis, can, be, avoided, by, simply, normalizing, this, vector, if, it, has, a, nonzero, magnitude, on, the, other, hand, if, this, vector, has, a, zero, magnitude, it, means, that, sin, 0, displaystyle, sin, alpha, 0, in, other, words, this, vector, will, be, zero, if, and, only, if, the, rotation, angle, is, 0, or, 180, degrees, and, the, rotation, axis, may, be, assigned, in, this, case, by, normalizing, any, column, of, a, i, displaystyle, a, i, that, has, a, nonzero, magnitude, this, discussion, applies, to, a, proper, rotation, and, hence, det, a, 1, displaystyle, det, a, 1, any, improper, orthogonal, 3x3, matrix, b, displaystyle, b, may, be, written, as, b, a, displaystyle, b, a, in, which, a, displaystyle, a, is, proper, orthogonal, that, is, any, improper, orthogonal, 3x3, matrix, may, be, decomposed, as, a, proper, rotation, from, which, an, axis, of, rotation, can, be, found, as, described, above, followed, by, an, inversion, multiplication, by, 1, it, follows, that, the, rotation, axis, of, a, displaystyle, a, is, also, the, eigenvector, of, b, displaystyle, b, corresponding, to, an, eigenvalue, of, 1, as, much, as, every, tridimensional, rotation, has, a, rotation, axis, also, every, tridimensional, rotation, has, a, plane, which, is, perpendicular, to, the, rotation, axis, and, which, is, left, invariant, by, the, rotation, the, rotation, restricted, to, this, plane, is, an, ordinary, 2d, rotation, the, proof, proceeds, similarly, to, the, above, discussion, first, suppose, that, all, eigenvalues, of, the, 3d, rotation, matrix, a, are, real, this, means, that, there, is, an, orthogonal, basis, made, by, the, corresponding, eigenvectors, which, are, necessarily, orthogonal, over, which, the, effect, of, the, rotation, matrix, is, just, stretching, it, if, we, write, a, in, this, basis, it, is, diagonal, but, a, diagonal, orthogonal, matrix, is, made, of, just, 1s, and, 1s, in, the, diagonal, entries, therefore, we, do, not, have, a, proper, rotation, but, either, the, identity, or, the, result, of, a, sequence, of, reflections, it, follows, then, that, a, proper, rotation, has, some, complex, eigenvalue, let, v, be, the, corresponding, eigenvector, then, as, we, showed, in, the, previous, topic, v, displaystyle, bar, v, is, also, an, eigenvector, and, v, v, displaystyle, v, bar, v, and, i, v, v, displaystyle, i, v, bar, v, are, such, that, their, scalar, product, vanishes, because, since, v, t, v, displaystyle, bar, v, text, t, bar, v, is, real, it, equals, its, complex, conjugate, v, t, v, displaystyle, v, text, t, v, and, v, t, v, displaystyle, bar, v, text, t, v, and, v, t, v, displaystyle, v, text, t, bar, v, are, both, representations, of, the, same, scalar, product, between, v, displaystyle, v, and, v, displaystyle, bar, v, this, means, v, v, displaystyle, v, bar, v, and, i, v, v, displaystyle, i, v, bar, v, are, orthogonal, vectors, also, they, are, both, real, vectors, by, construction, these, vectors, span, the, same, subspace, as, v, displaystyle, v, and, v, displaystyle, bar, v, which, is, an, invariant, subspace, under, the, application, of, a, therefore, they, span, an, invariant, plane, this, plane, is, orthogonal, to, the, invariant, axis, which, corresponds, to, the, remaining, eigenvector, of, a, with, eigenvalue, 1, because, of, the, orthogonality, of, the, eigenvectors, of, a, a, vector, is, said, to, be, rotating, if, it, changes, its, orientation, this, effect, is, generally, only, accompanied, when, its, rate, of, change, vector, has, non, zero, perpendicular, component, to, the, original, vector, this, can, be, shown, to, be, the, case, by, considering, a, vector, a, displaystyle, vec, a, which, is, parameterized, by, some, variable, t, textstyle, t, for, which, d, a, 2, d, t, d, a, a, d, t, d, a, d, t, d, a, d, t, a, displaystyle, d, vec, a, 2, over, dt, d, vec, a, cdot, vec, a, over, dt, rightarrow, d, vec, a, over, dt, d, vec, a, over, dt, cdot, hat, a, which, also, gives, a, relation, of, rate, of, change, of, unit, vector, by, taking, a, displaystyle, vec, a, to, be, such, a, vector, d, a, d, t, a, 0, displaystyle, d, hat, a, over, dt, cdot, hat, a, 0, showing, that, d, a, d, t, textstyle, d, hat, a, over, dt, vector, is, perpendicular, to, the, vector, a, displaystyle, vec, a, from, d, a, d, t, d, a, a, d, t, d, a, d, t, a, a, d, a, d, t, displaystyle, d, vec, a, over, dt, d, vec, a, hat, a, over, dt, d, vec, a, over, dt, hat, a, vec, a, left, d, hat, a, over, dt, right, since, the, first, term, is, parallel, to, a, displaystyle, vec, a, and, the, second, perpendicular, to, it, we, can, conclude, in, general, that, the, parallel, and, perpendicular, components, of, rate, of, change, of, a, vector, independently, influence, only, the, magnitude, or, orientation, of, the, vector, respectively, hence, a, rotating, vector, always, has, a, non, zero, perpendicular, component, of, its, rate, of, change, vector, against, the, vector, itself, as, dimensions, increase, the, number, of, rotation, vectors, increases, along, a, four, dimensional, space, a, hyper, volume, rotations, occur, along, x, y, z, and, w, axis, an, object, rotated, on, a, w, axis, intersects, through, various, volumes, where, each, intersection, is, equal, to, a, self, contained, volume, at, an, angle, this, gives, way, to, a, new, axis, of, rotation, in, a, 4d, hypervolume, were, a, 3d, object, can, be, rotated, perpendicular, to, the, z, axis, the, speed, of, rotation, is, given, by, the, angular, frequency, rad, s, or, frequency, turns, per, time, or, period, seconds, days, etc, the, time, rate, of, change, of, angular, frequency, is, angular, acceleration, rad, s, 2, caused, by, torque, the, ratio, of, torque, to, the, angular, acceleration, is, given, by, the, moment, of, inertia, the, angular, velocity, vector, an, axial, vector, also, describes, the, direction, of, the, axis, of, rotation, similarly, the, torque, is, an, axial, vector, the, physics, of, the, rotation, around, a, fixed, axis, is, mathematically, described, with, the, axis, angle, representation, of, rotations, according, to, the, right, hand, rule, the, direction, away, from, the, observer, is, associated, with, clockwise, rotation, and, the, direction, towards, the, observer, with, counterclockwise, rotation, like, a, screw, it, is, possible, for, objects, to, have, periodic, circular, trajectories, without, changing, their, orientation, these, types, of, motion, are, treated, under, circular, motion, instead, of, rotation, more, specifically, as, a, curvilinear, translation, since, translation, involves, displacement, of, rigid, bodies, while, preserving, the, orientation, of, the, body, in, the, case, of, curvilinear, translation, all, the, points, have, the, same, instantaneous, velocity, whereas, relative, motion, can, only, be, observed, in, motions, involving, rotation, in, rotation, the, orientation, of, the, object, changes, and, the, change, in, orientation, is, independent, of, the, observers, whose, frames, of, reference, have, constant, relative, orientation, over, time, by, euler, s, theorem, any, change, in, orientation, can, be, described, by, rotation, about, an, axis, through, a, chosen, reference, point, hence, the, distinction, between, rotation, and, circular, motion, can, be, made, by, requiring, an, instantaneous, axis, for, rotation, a, line, passing, through, instantaneous, center, of, circle, and, perpendicular, to, the, plane, of, motion, in, the, example, depicting, curvilinear, translation, the, center, of, circles, for, the, motion, lie, on, a, straight, line, but, it, is, parallel, to, the, plane, of, motion, and, hence, does, not, resolve, to, an, axis, of, rotation, in, contrast, a, rotating, body, will, always, have, its, instantaneous, axis, of, zero, velocity, perpendicular, to, the, plane, of, motion, more, generally, due, to, chasles, theorem, any, motion, of, rigid, bodies, can, be, treated, as, a, composition, of, rotation, and, translation, called, general, plane, motion, a, simple, example, of, pure, rotation, is, considered, in, rotation, around, a, fixed, axis, the, laws, of, physics, are, currently, believed, to, be, invariant, under, any, fixed, rotation, although, they, do, appear, to, change, when, viewed, from, a, rotating, viewpoint, see, rotating, frame, of, reference, in, modern, physical, cosmology, the, cosmological, principle, is, the, notion, that, the, distribution, of, matter, in, the, universe, is, homogeneous, and, isotropic, when, viewed, on, a, large, enough, scale, since, the, forces, are, expected, to, act, uniformly, throughout, the, universe, and, have, no, preferred, direction, and, should, therefore, produce, no, observable, irregularities, in, the, large, scale, structuring, over, the, course, of, evolution, of, the, matter, field, that, was, initially, laid, down, by, the, big, bang, in, particular, for, a, system, which, behaves, the, same, regardless, of, how, it, is, oriented, in, space, its, lagrangian, is, rotationally, invariant, according, to, noether, s, theorem, if, the, action, the, integral, over, time, of, its, lagrangian, of, a, physical, system, is, invariant, under, rotation, then, angular, momentum, is, conserved, euler, rotations, provide, an, alternative, description, of, a, rotation, it, is, a, composition, of, three, rotations, defined, as, the, movement, obtained, by, changing, one, of, the, euler, angles, while, leaving, the, other, two, constant, euler, rotations, are, never, expressed, in, terms, of, the, external, frame, or, in, terms, of, the, co, moving, rotated, body, frame, but, in, a, mixture, they, constitute, a, mixed, axes, of, rotation, system, where, the, first, angle, moves, the, line, of, nodes, around, the, external, axis, z, the, second, rotates, around, the, line, of, nodes, and, the, third, one, is, an, intrinsic, rotation, around, an, axis, fixed, in, the, body, that, moves, these, rotations, are, called, precession, nutation, and, intrinsic, rotation, in, astronomy, rotation, is, a, commonly, observed, phenomenon, it, includes, both, spin, auto, rotation, and, orbital, revolution, stars, planets, and, similar, bodies, may, spin, around, on, their, axes, the, rotation, rate, of, planets, in, the, solar, system, was, first, measured, by, tracking, visual, features, stellar, rotation, is, measured, through, doppler, shift, or, by, tracking, active, surface, features, an, example, is, sunspots, which, rotate, around, the, sun, at, the, same, velocity, as, the, outer, gases, that, make, up, the, sun, under, some, circumstances, orbiting, bodies, may, lock, their, spin, rotation, to, their, orbital, rotation, around, a, larger, body, this, effect, is, called, tidal, locking, the, moon, is, tidal, locked, to, the, earth, this, rotation, induces, a, centrifugal, acceleration, in, the, reference, frame, of, the, earth, which, slightly, counteracts, the, effect, of, gravitation, the, closer, one, is, to, the, equator, earth, s, gravity, combines, both, mass, effects, such, that, an, object, weighs, slightly, less, at, the, equator, than, at, the, poles, another, is, that, over, time, the, earth, is, slightly, deformed, into, an, oblate, spheroid, a, similar, equatorial, bulge, develops, for, other, planets, another, consequence, of, the, rotation, of, a, planet, are, the, phenomena, of, precession, and, nutation, like, a, gyroscope, the, overall, effect, is, a, slight, wobble, in, the, movement, of, the, axis, of, a, planet, currently, the, tilt, of, the, earth, s, axis, to, its, orbital, plane, obliquity, of, the, ecliptic, is, 23, 44, degrees, but, this, angle, changes, slowly, over, thousands, of, years, see, also, precession, of, the, equinoxes, and, pole, star, while, revolution, is, often, used, as, a, synonym, for, rotation, in, many, fields, particularly, astronomy, and, related, fields, revolution, often, referred, to, as, orbital, revolution, for, clarity, is, used, when, one, body, moves, around, another, while, rotation, is, used, to, mean, the, movement, around, an, axis, moons, revolve, around, their, planets, planets, revolve, about, their, stars, such, as, the, earth, around, the, sun, and, stars, slowly, revolve, about, their, galaxial, centers, the, motion, of, the, components, of, galaxies, is, complex, but, it, usually, includes, a, rotation, component, most, planets, in, the, solar, system, including, earth, spin, in, the, same, direction, as, they, orbit, the, sun, the, exceptions, are, venus, and, uranus, venus, may, be, thought, of, as, rotating, slowly, backward, or, being, upside, down, uranus, rotates, nearly, on, its, side, relative, to, its, orbit, current, speculation, is, that, uranus, started, off, with, a, typical, prograde, orientation, and, was, knocked, on, its, side, by, a, large, impact, early, in, its, history, the, dwarf, planet, pluto, formerly, considered, a, planet, is, anomalous, in, several, ways, including, that, it, also, rotates, on, its, side, in, flight, dynamics, the, principal, rotations, described, with, euler, angles, above, are, known, as, pitch, roll, and, yaw, the, term, rotation, is, also, used, in, aviation, to, refer, to, the, upward, pitch, nose, moves, up, of, an, aircraft, particularly, when, starting, the, climb, after, takeoff, principal, rotations, have, the, advantage, of, modelling, a, number, of, physical, systems, such, as, gimbals, and, joysticks, so, are, easily, visualised, and, are, a, very, compact, way, of, storing, a, rotation, but, they, are, difficult, to, use, in, calculations, as, even, simple, operations, like, combining, rotations, are, expensive, to, do, and, suffer, from, a, form, of, gimbal, lock, where, the, angles, cannot, be, uniquely, calculated, for, certain, rotations, many, amusement, rides, provide, rotation, a, ferris, wheel, has, a, horizontal, central, axis, and, parallel, axes, for, each, gondola, where, the, rotation, is, opposite, by, gravity, or, mechanically, as, a, result, at, any, time, the, orientation, of, the, gondola, is, upright, not, rotated, just, translated, the, tip, of, the, translation, vector, describes, a, circle, a, carousel, provides, rotation, about, a, vertical, axis, many, rides, provide, a, combination, of, rotations, about, several, axes, in, chair, o, planes, the, rotation, about, the, vertical, axis, is, provided, mechanically, while, the, rotation, about, the, horizontal, axis, is, due, to, the, centripetal, force, in, roller, coaster, inversions, the, rotation, about, the, horizontal, axis, is, one, or, more, full, cycles, where, inertia, keeps, people, in, their, seats, rotation, of, a, ball, or, other, object, usually, called, spin, plays, a, role, in, many, sports, including, topspin, and, backspin, in, tennis, english, follow, and, draw, in, billiards, and, pool, curve, balls, in, baseball, spin, bowling, in, cricket, flying, disc, sports, etc, table, tennis, paddles, are, manufactured, with, different, surface, characteristics, to, allow, the, player, to, impart, a, greater, or, lesser, amount, of, spin, to, the, ball, rotation, of, a, player, one, or, more, times, around, a, vertical, axis, may, be, called, spin, in, figure, skating, twirling, of, the, baton, or, the, performer, in, baton, twirling, or, 360, 540, 720, etc, in, snowboarding, etc, rotation, of, a, player, or, performer, one, or, more, times, around, a, horizontal, axis, may, be, called, a, flip, roll, somersault, heli, etc, in, gymnastics, waterskiing, or, many, other, sports, or, a, one, and, a, half, two, and, a, half, gainer, starting, facing, away, from, the, water, etc, in, diving, etc, a, combination, of, vertical, and, horizontal, rotation, back, flip, with, 360, is, called, a, m, bius, in, waterskiing, freestyle, jumping, rotation, of, a, player, around, a, vertical, axis, generally, between, 180, and, 360, degrees, may, be, called, a, spin, move, and, is, used, as, a, deceptive, or, avoidance, manoeuvre, or, in, an, attempt, to, play, pass, or, receive, a, ball, or, puck, etc, or, to, afford, a, player, a, view, of, the, goal, or, other, players, it, is, often, seen, in, hockey, basketball, football, of, various, codes, tennis, etc
