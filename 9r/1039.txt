spin, is, an, intrinsic, form, of, angular, momentum, carried, by, elementary, particles, and, thus, by, composite, particles, such, as, hadrons, atomic, nuclei, and, atoms, 183, 184, spin, is, quantized, and, accurate, models, for, the, interaction, with, spin, require, relativistic, quantum, mechanics, or, quantum, field, theory, the, existence, of, electron, spin, angular, momentum, is, inferred, from, experiments, such, as, the, stern, gerlach, experiment, in, which, silver, atoms, were, observed, to, possess, two, possible, discrete, angular, momenta, despite, having, no, orbital, angular, momentum, the, relativistic, spin, statistics, theorem, connects, electron, spin, quantization, to, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, observations, of, exclusion, imply, spin, and, observations, of, spin, imply, exclusion, spin, is, described, mathematically, as, a, vector, for, some, particles, such, as, photons, and, as, spinors, and, bispinors, for, other, particles, such, as, electrons, spinors, and, bispinors, behave, similarly, to, vectors, they, have, definite, magnitudes, and, change, under, rotations, however, they, use, an, unconventional, direction, all, elementary, particles, of, a, given, kind, have, the, same, magnitude, of, spin, angular, momentum, though, its, direction, may, change, these, are, indicated, by, assigning, the, particle, a, spin, quantum, number, 183, 184, the, si, units, of, spin, are, the, same, as, classical, angular, momentum, i, e, n, m, s, j, s, or, kg, m, 2, s, 1, in, quantum, mechanics, angular, momentum, and, spin, angular, momentum, take, discrete, values, proportional, to, the, planck, constant, in, practice, spin, is, usually, given, as, a, dimensionless, spin, quantum, number, by, dividing, the, spin, angular, momentum, by, the, reduced, planck, constant, often, the, spin, quantum, number, is, simply, called, spin, the, earliest, models, for, electron, spin, imagined, a, rotating, charged, mass, but, this, model, fails, when, examined, in, detail, the, required, space, distribution, does, not, match, limits, on, the, electron, radius, the, required, rotation, speed, exceeds, the, speed, of, light, in, the, standard, model, the, fundamental, particles, are, all, considered, point, like, they, have, their, effects, through, the, field, that, surrounds, them, any, model, for, spin, based, on, mass, rotation, would, need, to, be, consistent, with, that, model, wolfgang, pauli, a, central, figure, in, the, history, of, quantum, spin, initially, rejected, any, idea, that, the, degree, of, freedom, he, introduced, to, explain, experimental, observations, was, related, to, rotation, he, called, it, classically, non, describable, two, valuedness, later, he, allowed, that, it, is, related, to, angular, momentum, but, insisted, on, considering, spin, an, abstract, property, this, approach, allowed, pauli, to, develop, a, proof, of, his, fundamental, pauli, exclusion, principle, a, proof, now, called, the, spin, statistics, theorem, in, retrospect, this, insistence, and, the, style, of, his, proof, initiated, the, modern, particle, physics, era, where, abstract, quantum, properties, derived, from, symmetry, properties, dominate, concrete, interpretation, became, secondary, and, optional, the, first, classical, model, for, spin, proposed, small, rigid, particle, rotating, about, an, axis, as, ordinary, use, of, the, word, may, suggest, angular, momentum, can, be, computed, from, a, classical, field, as, well, 63, by, applying, frederik, belinfante, s, approach, to, calculating, the, angular, momentum, of, a, field, hans, c, ohanian, showed, that, spin, is, essentially, a, wave, property, generated, by, a, circulating, flow, of, charge, in, the, wave, field, of, the, electron, this, same, concept, of, spin, can, be, applied, to, gravity, waves, in, water, spin, is, generated, by, subwavelength, circular, motion, of, water, particles, unlike, classical, wavefield, circulation, which, allows, continuous, values, of, angular, momentum, quantum, wavefields, allow, only, discrete, values, consequently, energy, transfer, to, or, from, spins, states, always, occurs, in, fixed, quantum, steps, only, a, few, steps, are, allowed, for, many, qualitative, purposes, the, complexity, of, the, spin, quantum, wavefields, can, be, ignored, and, the, system, properties, can, be, discussed, in, terms, of, integer, or, half, integer, spin, models, as, discussed, in, quantum, numbers, below, quantitative, calculations, of, spin, properties, for, electrons, requires, the, dirac, s, relativistic, wave, equation, as, the, name, suggests, spin, was, originally, conceived, as, the, rotation, of, a, particle, around, some, axis, historically, orbital, angular, momentum, related, to, particle, orbits, 131, while, the, names, based, on, mechanical, models, have, survived, the, physical, explanation, has, not, quantization, fundamentally, alters, the, character, of, both, spin, and, orbital, angular, momentum, since, elementary, particles, are, point, like, self, rotation, is, not, well, defined, for, them, however, spin, implies, that, the, phase, of, the, particle, depends, on, the, angle, as, e, i, s, displaystyle, e, is, theta, for, rotation, of, angle, around, the, axis, parallel, to, the, spin, s, this, is, equivalent, to, the, quantum, mechanical, interpretation, of, momentum, as, phase, dependence, in, the, position, and, of, orbital, angular, momentum, as, phase, dependence, in, the, angular, position, for, fermions, the, picture, is, less, clear, angular, velocity, is, equal, by, the, ehrenfest, theorem, to, the, derivative, of, the, hamiltonian, to, its, conjugate, momentum, which, is, the, total, angular, momentum, operator, j, l, s, therefore, if, the, hamiltonian, h, is, dependent, upon, the, spin, s, dh, ds, is, non, zero, and, the, spin, causes, angular, velocity, and, hence, actual, rotation, i, e, a, change, in, the, phase, angle, relation, over, time, however, whether, this, holds, for, free, electron, is, ambiguous, since, for, an, electron, s, 2, is, constant, and, therefore, it, is, a, matter, of, interpretation, whether, the, hamiltonian, includes, such, a, term, nevertheless, spin, appears, in, the, dirac, equation, and, thus, the, relativistic, hamiltonian, of, the, electron, treated, as, a, dirac, field, can, be, interpreted, as, including, a, dependence, in, the, spin, s, spin, obeys, the, mathematical, laws, of, angular, momentum, quantization, the, specific, properties, of, spin, angular, momenta, include, the, conventional, definition, of, the, spin, quantum, number, is, s, n, 2, where, n, can, be, any, non, negative, integer, hence, the, allowed, values, of, s, are, 0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, etc, the, value, of, s, for, an, elementary, particle, depends, only, on, the, type, of, particle, and, cannot, be, altered, in, any, known, way, in, contrast, to, the, spin, direction, described, below, the, spin, angular, momentum, s, of, any, physical, system, is, quantized, the, allowed, values, of, s, are, s, s, s, 1, h, 2, n, 2, n, 2, 2, h, 4, n, n, 2, displaystyle, s, hbar, sqrt, s, s, 1, frac, h, 2, pi, sqrt, frac, n, 2, frac, n, 2, 2, frac, h, 4, pi, sqrt, n, n, 2, where, h, is, the, planck, constant, and, h, 2, textstyle, hbar, frac, h, 2, pi, is, the, reduced, planck, constant, in, contrast, orbital, angular, momentum, can, only, take, on, integer, values, of, s, i, e, even, numbered, values, of, n, those, particles, with, half, integer, spins, such, as, 1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 2, are, known, as, fermions, while, those, particles, with, integer, spins, such, as, 0, 1, 2, are, known, as, bosons, the, two, families, of, particles, obey, different, rules, and, broadly, have, different, roles, in, the, world, around, us, a, key, distinction, between, the, two, families, is, that, fermions, obey, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, that, is, there, cannot, be, two, identical, fermions, simultaneously, having, the, same, quantum, numbers, meaning, roughly, having, the, same, position, velocity, and, spin, direction, fermions, obey, the, rules, of, fermi, dirac, statistics, in, contrast, bosons, obey, the, rules, of, bose, einstein, statistics, and, have, no, such, restriction, so, they, may, bunch, together, in, identical, states, also, composite, particles, can, have, spins, different, from, their, component, particles, for, example, a, helium, 4, atom, in, the, ground, state, has, spin, 0, and, behaves, like, a, boson, even, though, the, quarks, and, electrons, which, make, it, up, are, all, fermions, this, has, some, profound, consequences, the, spin, statistics, theorem, splits, particles, into, two, groups, bosons, and, fermions, where, bosons, obey, bose, einstein, statistics, and, fermions, obey, fermi, dirac, statistics, and, therefore, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, specifically, the, theorem, requires, that, particles, with, half, integer, spins, obey, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, while, particles, with, integer, spin, do, not, as, an, example, electrons, have, half, integer, spin, and, are, fermions, that, obey, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, while, photons, have, integer, spin, and, do, not, the, theorem, was, derived, by, wolfgang, pauli, in, 1940, it, relies, on, both, quantum, mechanics, and, the, theory, of, special, relativity, pauli, described, this, connection, between, spin, and, statistics, as, one, of, the, most, important, applications, of, the, special, relativity, theory, particles, with, spin, can, possess, a, magnetic, dipole, moment, just, like, a, rotating, electrically, charged, body, in, classical, electrodynamics, these, magnetic, moments, can, be, experimentally, observed, in, several, ways, e, g, by, the, deflection, of, particles, by, inhomogeneous, magnetic, fields, in, a, stern, gerlach, experiment, or, by, measuring, the, magnetic, fields, generated, by, the, particles, themselves, the, intrinsic, magnetic, moment, of, a, spin, 1, 2, particle, with, charge, q, mass, m, and, spin, angular, momentum, s, is, where, the, dimensionless, quantity, g, s, is, called, the, spin, g, factor, for, exclusively, orbital, rotations, it, would, be, 1, assuming, that, the, mass, and, the, charge, occupy, spheres, of, equal, radius, the, electron, being, a, charged, elementary, particle, possesses, a, nonzero, magnetic, moment, one, of, the, triumphs, of, the, theory, of, quantum, electrodynamics, is, its, accurate, prediction, of, the, electron, g, factor, which, has, been, experimentally, determined, to, have, the, value, 2, 002, 319, 304, 360, 92, 36, with, the, digits, in, parentheses, denoting, measurement, uncertainty, in, the, last, two, digits, at, one, standard, deviation, the, value, of, 2, arises, from, the, dirac, equation, a, fundamental, equation, connecting, the, electron, s, spin, with, its, electromagnetic, properties, and, the, deviation, from, 2, arises, from, the, electron, s, interaction, with, the, surrounding, quantum, fields, including, its, own, electromagnetic, field, and, virtual, particles, composite, particles, also, possess, magnetic, moments, associated, with, their, spin, in, particular, the, neutron, possesses, a, non, zero, magnetic, moment, despite, being, electrically, neutral, this, fact, was, an, early, indication, that, the, neutron, is, not, an, elementary, particle, in, fact, it, is, made, up, of, quarks, which, are, electrically, charged, particles, the, magnetic, moment, of, the, neutron, comes, from, the, spins, of, the, individual, quarks, and, their, orbital, motions, neutrinos, are, both, elementary, and, electrically, neutral, the, minimally, extended, standard, model, that, takes, into, account, non, zero, neutrino, masses, predicts, neutrino, magnetic, moments, of, where, the, are, the, neutrino, magnetic, moments, m, are, the, neutrino, masses, and, b, is, the, bohr, magneton, new, physics, above, the, electroweak, scale, could, however, lead, to, significantly, higher, neutrino, magnetic, moments, it, can, be, shown, in, a, model, independent, way, that, neutrino, magnetic, moments, larger, than, about, 10, 14, b, are, unnatural, because, they, would, also, lead, to, large, radiative, contributions, to, the, neutrino, mass, since, the, neutrino, masses, are, known, to, be, at, most, about, 1, ev, c, 2, fine, tuning, would, be, necessary, in, order, to, prevent, large, contributions, to, the, neutrino, mass, via, radiative, corrections, the, measurement, of, neutrino, magnetic, moments, is, an, active, area, of, research, experimental, results, have, put, the, neutrino, magnetic, moment, at, less, than, 1, 2, 10, 10, times, the, electron, s, magnetic, moment, on, the, other, hand, elementary, particles, with, spin, but, without, electric, charge, such, as, a, photon, or, a, z, boson, do, not, have, a, magnetic, moment, in, ordinary, materials, the, magnetic, dipole, moments, of, individual, atoms, produce, magnetic, fields, that, cancel, one, another, because, each, dipole, points, in, a, random, direction, with, the, overall, average, being, very, near, zero, ferromagnetic, materials, below, their, curie, temperature, however, exhibit, magnetic, domains, in, which, the, atomic, dipole, moments, spontaneously, align, locally, producing, a, macroscopic, non, zero, magnetic, field, from, the, domain, these, are, the, ordinary, magnets, with, which, we, are, all, familiar, in, paramagnetic, materials, the, magnetic, dipole, moments, of, individual, atoms, will, partially, align, with, an, externally, applied, magnetic, field, in, diamagnetic, materials, on, the, other, hand, the, magnetic, dipole, moments, of, individual, atoms, align, oppositely, to, any, externally, applied, magnetic, field, even, if, it, requires, energy, to, do, so, the, study, of, the, behavior, of, such, spin, models, is, a, thriving, area, of, research, in, condensed, matter, physics, for, instance, the, ising, model, describes, spins, dipoles, that, have, only, two, possible, states, up, and, down, whereas, in, the, heisenberg, model, the, spin, vector, is, allowed, to, point, in, any, direction, these, models, have, many, interesting, properties, which, have, led, to, interesting, results, in, the, theory, of, phase, transitions, in, classical, mechanics, the, angular, momentum, of, a, particle, possesses, not, only, a, magnitude, how, fast, the, body, is, rotating, but, also, a, direction, either, up, or, down, on, the, axis, of, rotation, of, the, particle, quantum, mechanical, spin, also, contains, information, about, direction, but, in, a, more, subtle, form, quantum, mechanics, states, that, the, component, of, angular, momentum, for, a, spin, s, particle, measured, along, any, direction, can, only, take, on, the, values, where, s, i, is, the, spin, component, along, the, i, th, axis, either, x, y, or, z, s, i, is, the, spin, projection, quantum, number, along, the, i, th, axis, and, s, is, the, principal, spin, quantum, number, discussed, in, the, previous, section, conventionally, the, direction, chosen, is, the, z, axis, where, s, z, is, the, spin, component, along, the, z, axis, s, z, is, the, spin, projection, quantum, number, along, the, z, axis, one, can, see, that, there, are, 2, s, 1, possible, values, of, s, z, the, number, 2, s, 1, is, the, multiplicity, of, the, spin, system, for, example, there, are, only, two, possible, values, for, a, spin, 1, 2, particle, s, z, 1, 2, and, s, z, 1, 2, these, correspond, to, quantum, states, in, which, the, spin, component, is, pointing, in, the, z, or, z, directions, respectively, and, are, often, referred, to, as, spin, up, and, spin, down, for, a, spin, 3, 2, particle, like, a, delta, baryon, the, possible, values, are, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, for, a, given, quantum, state, one, could, think, of, a, spin, vector, s, textstyle, langle, s, rangle, whose, components, are, the, expectation, values, of, the, spin, components, along, each, axis, i, e, s, s, x, s, y, s, z, textstyle, langle, s, rangle, this, vector, then, would, describe, the, direction, in, which, the, spin, is, pointing, corresponding, to, the, classical, concept, of, the, axis, of, rotation, it, turns, out, that, the, spin, vector, is, not, very, useful, in, actual, quantum, mechanical, calculations, because, it, cannot, be, measured, directly, s, x, s, y, and, s, z, cannot, possess, simultaneous, definite, values, because, of, a, quantum, uncertainty, relation, between, them, however, for, statistically, large, collections, of, particles, that, have, been, placed, in, the, same, pure, quantum, state, such, as, through, the, use, of, a, stern, gerlach, apparatus, the, spin, vector, does, have, a, well, defined, experimental, meaning, it, specifies, the, direction, in, ordinary, space, in, which, a, subsequent, detector, must, be, oriented, in, order, to, achieve, the, maximum, possible, probability, 100, of, detecting, every, particle, in, the, collection, for, spin, 1, 2, particles, this, probability, drops, off, smoothly, as, the, angle, between, the, spin, vector, and, the, detector, increases, until, at, an, angle, of, 180, that, is, for, detectors, oriented, in, the, opposite, direction, to, the, spin, vector, the, expectation, of, detecting, particles, from, the, collection, reaches, a, minimum, of, 0, as, a, qualitative, concept, the, spin, vector, is, often, handy, because, it, is, easy, to, picture, classically, for, instance, quantum, mechanical, spin, can, exhibit, phenomena, analogous, to, classical, gyroscopic, effects, for, example, one, can, exert, a, kind, of, torque, on, an, electron, by, putting, it, in, a, magnetic, field, the, field, acts, upon, the, electron, s, intrinsic, magnetic, dipole, moment, see, the, following, section, the, result, is, that, the, spin, vector, undergoes, precession, just, like, a, classical, gyroscope, this, phenomenon, is, known, as, electron, spin, resonance, esr, the, equivalent, behaviour, of, protons, in, atomic, nuclei, is, used, in, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, nmr, spectroscopy, and, imaging, mathematically, quantum, mechanical, spin, states, are, described, by, vector, like, objects, known, as, spinors, there, are, subtle, differences, between, the, behavior, of, spinors, and, vectors, under, coordinate, rotations, for, example, rotating, a, spin, 1, 2, particle, by, 360, does, not, bring, it, back, to, the, same, quantum, state, but, to, the, state, with, the, opposite, quantum, phase, this, is, detectable, in, principle, with, interference, experiments, to, return, the, particle, to, its, exact, original, state, one, needs, a, 720, rotation, the, plate, trick, and, m, bius, strip, give, non, quantum, analogies, a, spin, zero, particle, can, only, have, a, single, quantum, state, even, after, torque, is, applied, rotating, a, spin, 2, particle, 180, can, bring, it, back, to, the, same, quantum, state, and, a, spin, 4, particle, should, be, rotated, 90, to, bring, it, back, to, the, same, quantum, state, the, spin, 2, particle, can, be, analogous, to, a, straight, stick, that, looks, the, same, even, after, it, is, rotated, 180, and, a, spin, 0, particle, can, be, imagined, as, sphere, which, looks, the, same, after, whatever, angle, it, is, turned, through, spin, obeys, commutation, relations, analogous, to, those, of, the, orbital, angular, momentum, s, j, s, k, i, j, k, l, s, l, displaystyle, left, i, hbar, varepsilon, jkl, hat, s, l, where, jkl, is, the, levi, civita, symbol, it, follows, as, with, angular, momentum, that, the, eigenvectors, of, s, 2, displaystyle, hat, s, 2, and, s, z, displaystyle, hat, s, z, expressed, as, kets, in, the, total, s, basis, are, 166, s, 2, s, m, s, 2, s, s, 1, s, m, s,

harmonics, they, are, not, functions, of, and, there, is, also, no, reason, to, exclude, half, integer, values, of, s, and, m, s, all, quantum, mechanical, particles, possess, an, intrinsic, spin, s, displaystyle, s, though, this, value, may, be, equal, to, zero, the, projection, of, the, spin, s, displaystyle, s, on, any, axis, is, quantized, in, units, of, the, reduced, planck, constant, such, that, the, state, function, of, the, particle, is, say, not, r, displaystyle, psi, psi, mathbf, r, but, r, s, z, displaystyle, psi, psi, mathbf, r, s, z, where, s, z, displaystyle, s, z, can, take, only, the, values, of, the, following, discrete, set, s, z, s, s, 1, s, 1, s, displaystyle, s, z, in, s, hbar, s, 1, hbar, dots, s, 1, hbar, s, hbar, one, distinguishes, bosons, integer, spin, and, fermions, half, integer, spin, the, total, angular, momentum, conserved, in, interaction, processes, is, then, the, sum, of, the, orbital, angular, momentum, and, the, spin, the, quantum, mechanical, operators, associated, with, spin, 1, 2, observables, are, s, 2, displaystyle, hat, mathbf, s, frac, hbar, 2, boldsymbol, sigma, where, in, cartesian, components, s, x, 2, x, s, y, 2, y, s, z, 2, z,

sigma, n, for, a, system, of, n, identical, particles, having, spin, s, must, change, upon, interchanges, of, any, two, of, the, n, particles, as, r, i, i, r, j, j, 1, 2, s, r, j, j, r, i, i,

2, s, will, reduce, to, 1, for, fermions, to, 1, this, permutation, postulate, for, n, particle, state, functions, has, most, important, consequences, in, daily, life, e, g, the, periodic, table, of, the, chemical, elements, as, described, above, quantum, mechanics, states, that, components, of, angular, momentum, measured, along, any, direction, can, only, take, a, number, of, discrete, values, the, most, convenient, quantum, mechanical, description, of, particle, s, spin, is, therefore, with, a, set, of, complex, numbers, corresponding, to, amplitudes, of, finding, a, given, value, of, projection, of, its, intrinsic, angular, momentum, on, a, given, axis, for, instance, for, a, spin, 1, 2, particle, we, would, need, two, numbers, a, 1, 2, giving, amplitudes, of, finding, it, with, projection, of, angular, momentum, equal, to, 2, and, 2, satisfying, the, requirement, a, 1, 2, 2, a, 1, 2, 2, 1, displaystyle, a, 1, 2, 2, a, 1, 2, 2, 1, for, a, generic, particle, with, spin, s, we, would, need, 2, s, 1, such, parameters, since, these, numbers, depend, on, the, choice, of, the, axis, they, transform, into, each, other, non, trivially, when, this, axis, is, rotated, it, is, clear, that, the, transformation, law, must, be, linear, so, we, can, represent, it, by, associating, a, matrix, with, each, rotation, and, the, product, of, two, transformation, matrices, corresponding, to, rotations, a, and, b, must, be, equal, up, to, phase, to, the, matrix, representing, rotation, ab, further, rotations, preserve, the, quantum, mechanical, inner, product, and, so, should, our, transformation, matrices, m, j, j, a, m, b, m, m, j, j, n, j, j, u, n, m, a, n, k, j, j, u, k, m, b, k, displaystyle, sum, m, j, j, a, m, b, m, sum, m, j, j, left, sum, n, j, j, u, nm, a, n, right,

a, unitary, projective, representation, of, the, rotation, group, so, 3, each, such, representation, corresponds, to, a, representation, of, the, covering, group, of, so, 3, which, is, su, 2, there, is, one, n, dimensional, irreducible, representation, of, su, 2, for, each, dimension, though, this, representation, is, n, dimensional, real, for, odd, n, and, n, dimensional, complex, for, even, n, hence, of, real, dimension, 2, n, for, a, rotation, by, angle, in, the, plane, with, normal, vector, textstyle, hat, boldsymbol, theta, u, e, i, s, displaystyle, u, e, frac, i, hbar, boldsymbol,

relied, on, the, spin, operator, commutation, relations, this, proof, holds, for, any, dimension, i, e, for, any, principal, spin, quantum, number, s, 164, a, generic, rotation, in, 3, dimensional,

generic, spin, state, can, be, written, as, a, superposition, of, states, with, definite, m, we, see, that, if, s, is, an, integer, the, values, of, m, are, all, integers, and, this, matrix, corresponds, to, the, identity, operator, however, if, s, is, a, half, integer, the, values, of, m, are, also, all, half, integers, giving, 1, 2, m, 1, for, all, m, and, hence, upon, rotation, by, 2, the, state, picks, up, a, minus, sign, this, fact, is, a, crucial, element, of, the, proof, of, the, spin, statistics, theorem, we, could, try, the, same, approach, to, determine, the, behavior, of, spin, under, general, lorentz, transformations, but, we, would, immediately, discover, a, major, obstacle, unlike, so, 3, the, group, of, lorentz, transformations, so, 3, 1, is, non, compact, and, therefore, does, not, have, any, faithful, unitary, finite, dimensional, representations, in, case, of, spin, 1, 2, particles, it, is, possible, to, find, a, construction, that, includes, both, a, finite, dimensional, representation, and, a, scalar, product, that, is, preserved, by, this, representation, we, associate, a, 4, component, dirac, spinor, with, each, particle, these, spinors,

there, is, a, sign, ambiguity, the, present, convention, is, used, by, software, such, as, sympy, while, many, physics, textbooks, such, as, sakurai, and, griffiths, prefer, to, make, it, real, and, positive, by, the, postulates, of, quantum, mechanics, an, experiment, designed, to, measure, the, electron, spin, on, the, x, y, or, z, axis, can, only, yield, an, eigenvalue, of, the, corresponding, spin, operator, s, x, s, y, or, s, z, on, that, axis, i, e, 2, or, 2, the, quantum, state, of, a, particle, with, respect, to, spin, can, be, represented, by, a, two, component, spinor, a, b, i, c, d, i, displaystyle, psi, begin, pmatrix, a, bi, c, di, end, pmatrix, when, the, spin, of, this, particle, is, measured, with, respect, to, a, given, axis, in, this, example, the, x, axis, the, probability, that, its, spin, will, be, measured, as, 2, is, just, x, 2, displaystyle, big, langle, psi, x, psi, rangle, big, 2, correspondingly, the, probability, that, its, spin, will, be, measured, as, 2, is, just, x, 2, displaystyle, big, langle, psi, x, psi, rangle, big, 2, following, the, measurement, the, spin, state, of, the, particle, collapses, into, the, corresponding, eigenstate, as, a, result, if, the, particle, s, spin, along, a, given, axis, has, been, measured, to, have, a, given, eigenvalue, all, measurements, will, yield, the, same, eigenvalue, since, x, x, 2, 1, displaystyle, big, langle, psi, x, psi, x, rangle, big, 2, 1, etc, provided, that, no, measurements, of, the, spin, are, made, along, other, axes, the, operator, to, measure, spin, along, an, arbitrary, axis, direction, is, easily, obtained, from, the, pauli, spin, matrices, let, u, u, x, u, y, u, z, be, an, arbitrary, unit, vector, then, the, operator, for, spin, in, this, direction, is, simply, s, u, 2, u, x, x, u, y, y, u, z, z, displaystyle, s, u, frac, hbar, 2, u, x, sigma, x, u, y, sigma, y, u, z, sigma, z, the, operator, s, u, has, eigenvalues, of, 2, just, like, the, usual, spin, matrices, this, method, of, finding, the, operator, for, spin, in, an, arbitrary, direction, generalizes, to, higher, spin, states, one, takes, the, dot, product, of, the, direction, with, a, vector, of, the, three, operators, for, the, three, x, y, z, axis, directions, a, normalized, spinor, for, spin, 1, 2, in, the, u, x, u, y, u, z, direction, which, works, for, all, spin, states, except, spin, down, where, it, will, give, 0, 0, is, 1, 2, 2, u, z, 1, u, z, u, x, i, u, y, displaystyle, frac, 1, sqrt, 2, 2u, z, begin, pmatrix, 1, u, z, u, x, iu, y, end, pmatrix, the, above, spinor, is, obtained, in, the, usual, way, by, diagonalizing, the, u, matrix, and, finding, the, eigenstates, corresponding, to, the, eigenvalues, in, quantum, mechanics, vectors, are, termed, normalized, when, multiplied, by, a, normalizing, factor, which, results, in, the, vector, having, a, length, of, unity, since, the, pauli, matrices, do, not, commute, measurements, of, spin, along, the, different, axes, are, incompatible, this, means, that, if, for, example, we, know, the, spin, along, the, x, axis, and, we, then, measure, the, spin, along, the, y, axis, we, have, invalidated, our, previous, knowledge, of, the, x, axis, spin, this, can, be, seen, from, the, property, of, the, eigenvectors, i, e, eigenstates, of, the, pauli, matrices, that, x, y, 2, x, z, 2, y, z, 2, 1, 2, displaystyle, big, langle, psi, x, pm, psi, y, pm, rangle, big, 2, big, langle, psi, x, pm, psi, z, pm, rangle, big, 2, big, langle, psi, y, pm, psi, z, pm, rangle, big, 2, tfrac, 1, 2, so, when, physicists, measure, the, spin, of, a, particle, along, the, x, axis, as, for, example, 2, the, particle, s, spin, state, collapses, into, the, eigenstate, x, displaystyle, psi, x, rangle, when, we, then, subsequently, measure, the, particle, s, spin, along, the, y, axis, the, spin, state, will, now, collapse, into, either, y, displaystyle, psi, y, rangle, or, y, displaystyle, psi, y, rangle, each, with, probability, 1, 2, let, us, say, in, our, example, that, we, measure, 2, when, we, now, return, to, measure, the, particle, s, spin, along, the, x, axis, again, the, probabilities, that, we, will, measure, 2, or, 2, are, each, 1, 2, i, e, they, are, x, y, 2, displaystyle, big, langle, psi, x, psi, y, rangle, big, 2, and, x, y, 2, displaystyle, big, langle, psi, x, psi, y, rangle, big, 2, respectively, this, implies, that, the, original, measurement, of, the, spin, along, the, x, axis, is, no, longer, valid, since, the, spin, along, the, x, axis, will, now, be, measured, to, have, either, eigenvalue, with, equal, probability, the, spin, 1, 2, operator, s, 2, forms, the, fundamental, representation, of, su, 2, by, taking, kronecker, products, of, this, representation, with, itself, repeatedly, one, may, construct, all, higher, irreducible, representations, that, is, the, resulting, spin, operators, for, higher, spin, systems, in, three, spatial, dimensions, can, be, calculated, for, arbitrarily, large, s, using, this, spin, operator, and, ladder, operators, for, example, taking, the, kronecker, product, of, two, spin, 1, 2, yields, a, four, dimensional, representation, which, is, separable, into, a, 3, dimensional, spin, 1, triplet, states, and, a, 1, dimensional, spin, 0, representation, singlet, state, the, resulting, irreducible, representations, yield, the, following, spin, matrices, and, eigenvalues, in, the, z, basis, also, useful, in, the, quantum, mechanics, of, multiparticle, systems, the, general, pauli, group, g, n, is, defined, to, consist, of, all, n, fold, tensor, products, of, pauli, matrices, the, analog, formula, of, euler, s, formula, in, terms, of, the, pauli, matrices, r, n, e, i, 2, n, i, cos, 2, i, n, sin, 2, displaystyle, hat, r, theta, hat, mathbf, n,

but, less, simple, in, tables, of, the, spin, quantum, number, s, for, nuclei, or, particles, the, spin, is, often, followed, by, a, or, this, refers, to, the, parity, with, for, even, parity, wave, function, unchanged, by, spatial, inversion, and, for, odd, parity, wave, function, negated, by, spatial, inversion, for, example, see, the, isotopes, of, bismuth, in, which, the, list, of, isotopes, includes, the, column, nuclear, spin, and, parity, for, bi, 209, the, longest, lived, isotope, the, entry, 9, 2, means, that, the, nuclear, spin, is, 9, 2, and, the, parity, is, odd, the, nuclear, spin, of, atoms, can, be, determined, by, sophisticated, improvements, to, the, original, stern, gerlach, experiment, a, single, energy, monochromatic, molecular, beam, of, atoms, in, an, inhomogeneous, magnetic, field, will, split, into, beams, representing, each, possible, spin, quantum, state, for, an, atom, with, electronic, spin, s, and, nuclear, spin, i, there, are, 2, s, 1, 2, i, 1, spin, states, for, example, neutral, na, atoms, which, have, s, 1, 2, were, passed, through, a, series, of, inhomogeneous, magnetic, fields, that, selected, one, of, the, two, electronic, spin, states, and, separated, the, nuclear, spin, states, from, which, four, beams, were, observed, thus, the, nuclear, spin, for, 23, na, atoms, was, found, to, be, i, 3, 2, the, spin, of, pions, a, type, of, elementary, particle, was, determined, by, the, principle, of, detailed, balance, applied, to, those, collisions, of, protons, that, produced, charged, pions, and, deuterium, p, p, d, displaystyle, p, p, rightarrow, pi, d, the, known, spin, values, for, protons, and, deuterium, allows, analysis, of, the, collision, cross, section, to, show, that, displaystyle, pi, has, spin, s, 0, displaystyle, s, pi, 0, a, different, approach, is, needed, for, neutral, pions, in, that, case, the, decay, reaction, into, two, gamma, ray, photons, with, spin, one, 0, 2, displaystyle, pi, 0, rightarrow, 2, gamma, this, results, supplemented, with, additional, analysis, leads, to, the, conclusion, that, the, neutral, pion, also, has, spin, zero, 66, spin, has, important, theoretical, implications, and, practical, applications, well, established, direct, applications, of, spin, include, electron, spin, plays, an, important, role, in, magnetism, with, applications, for, instance, in, computer, memories, the, manipulation, of, nuclear, spin, by, radio, frequency, waves, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, is, important, in, chemical, spectroscopy, and, medical, imaging, spin, orbit, coupling, leads, to, the, fine, structure, of, atomic, spectra, which, is, used, in, atomic, clocks, and, in, the, modern, definition, of, the, second, precise, measurements, of, the, g, factor, of, the, electron, have, played, an, important, role, in, the, development, and, verification, of, quantum, electrodynamics, photon, spin, is, associated, with, the, polarization, of, light, photon, polarization, an, emerging, application, of, spin, is, as, a, binary, information, carrier, in, spin, transistors, the, original, concept, proposed, in, 1990, is, known, as, datta, das, spin, transistor, electronics, based, on, spin, transistors, are, referred, to, as, spintronics, the, manipulation, of, spin, in, dilute, magnetic, semiconductor, materials, such, as, metal, doped, zno, or, tio, 2, imparts, a, further, degree, of, freedom, and, has, the, potential, to, facilitate, the, fabrication, of, more, efficient, electronics, there, are, many, indirect, applications, and, manifestations, of, spin, and, the, associated, pauli, exclusion, principle, starting, with, the, periodic, table, of, chemistry, spin, was, first, discovered, in, the, context, of, the, emission, spectrum, of, alkali, metals, starting, around, 1910, many, experiments, on, different, atoms, produced, a, collection, of, relationships, involving, quantum, numbers, for, atomic, energy, levels, partially, summarized, in, bohr, s, model, for, the, atom, 106, transitions, between, levels, obeyed, selection, rules, and, the, rules, were, known, to, be, correlated, with, even, or, odd, atomic, number, additional, information, was, known, from, changes, to, atomic, spectra, observed, in, strong, magnetic, fields, known, as, the, zeeman, effect, in, 1924, wolfgang, pauli, used, this, large, collection, of, empirical, observations, to, propose, a, new, degree, of, freedom, introducing, what, he, called, a, two, valuedness, not, describable, classically, associated, with, the, electron, in, the, outermost, shell, the, physical, interpretation, of, pauli, s, degree, of, freedom, was, initially, unknown, ralph, kronig, one, of, alfred, land, s, assistants, suggested, in, early, 1925, that, it, was, produced, by, the, self, rotation, of, the, electron, when, pauli, heard, about, the, idea, he, criticized, it, severely, noting, that, the, electron, s, hypothetical, surface, would, have, to, be, moving, faster, than, the, speed, of, light, in, order, for, it, to, rotate, quickly, enough, to, produce, the, necessary, angular, momentum, this, would, violate, the, theory, of, relativity, largely, due, to, pauli, s, criticism, kronig, decided, not, to, publish, his, idea, in, the, autumn, of, 1925, the, same, thought, came, to, dutch, physicists, george, uhlenbeck, and, samuel, goudsmit, at, leiden, university, under, the, advice, of, paul, ehrenfest, they, published, their, results, the, young, physicists, immediately, regretted, the, publication, hendrik, lorentz, and, werner, heisenberg, both, pointed, out, problems, with, the, concept, of, a, spinning, electron, pauli, was, especially, unconvinced, and, continued, to, pursue, his, two, valued, degree, of, freedom, this, allowed, him, to, formulate, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, stating, that, no, two, electrons, can, have, the, same, quantum, state, in, the, same, quantum, system, fortunately, by, february, 1926, llewellyn, thomas, managed, to, resolve, a, factor, of, two, discrepancy, between, experimental, results, for, the, fine, structure, in, the, hydrogen, spectrum, and, calculations, based, on, uhlenbeck, and, goudsmit, s, and, kronig, s, unpublished, model, 385, this, discrepancy, was, due, to, a, relativistic, effect, the, difference, between, the, electron, s, rotating, rest, frame, and, the, nuclear, rest, frame, the, effect, is, now, known, as, thomas, precession, thomas, result, convinced, pauli, that, electron, spin, was, the, correct, interpretation, of, his, two, valued, degree, of, freedom, while, he, continued, to, insist, that, the, classical, rotating, charge, model, is, invalid, in, 1927, pauli, formalized, the, theory, of, spin, using, the, theory, of, quantum, mechanics, invented, by, erwin, schr, dinger, and, werner, heisenberg, he, pioneered, the, use, of, pauli, matrices, as, a, representation, of, the, spin, operators, and, introduced, a, two, component, spinor, wave, function, pauli, s, theory, of, spin, was, non, relativistic, in, 1928, paul, dirac, published, his, relativistic, electron, equation, using, a, four, component, spinor, known, as, a, dirac, spinor, for, the, electron, wave, function, relativistic, spin, explained, gyromagnetic, anomaly, in, 1940, pauli, proved, the, spin, statistics, theorem, which, states, that, fermions, have, half, integer, spin, and, bosons, have, integer, spin, in, retrospect, the, first, direct, experimental, evidence, of, the, electron, spin, was, the, stern, gerlach, experiment, of, 1922, however, the, correct, explanation, of, this, experiment, was, only, given, in, 1927, the, original, interpretation, assumed, the, two, spots, observed, in, the, experiment, were, due, to, quantized, orbital, angular, momentum, however, in, 1927, ronald, fraser, showed, that, sodium, atoms, are, isotropic, with, no, orbital, angular, momentum, and, suggested, that, the, observed, magnetic, properties, were, due, to, electron, spin, in, same, year, phipps, and, taylor, applied, the, stern, gerlach, technique, to, hydrogen, atoms, the, ground, state, of, hydrogen, has, zero, angular, momentum, but, the, measurements, again, showed, two, peaks, once, the, quantum, theory, became, established, it, became, clear, that, the, original, interpretation, could, not, have, been, correct, the, possible, values, of, orbital, angular, momentum, along, one, axis, is, always, an, odd, number, unlike, the, observations, hydrogen, atoms, have, a, single, electron, with, two, spin, states, giving, the, two, spots, observed, silver, atoms, have, closed, shells, which, do, not, contribute, to, the, magnetic, moment, and, only, the, unmatched, outer, electron, s, spin, responds, to, the, field
