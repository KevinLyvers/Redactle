palladium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, pd, and, atomic, number, 46, it, is, a, rare, and, lustrous, silvery, white, metal, discovered, in, 1802, by, the, english, chemist, william, hyde, wollaston, he, named, it, after, the, asteroid, pallas, formally, 2, pallas, which, was, itself, named, after, the, epithet, of, the, greek, goddess, athena, acquired, by, her, when, she, slew, pallas, palladium, platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium, and, osmium, form, a, group, of, elements, referred, to, as, the, platinum, group, metals, pgms, they, have, similar, chemical, properties, but, palladium, has, the, lowest, melting, point, and, is, the, least, dense, of, them, more, than, half, the, supply, of, palladium, and, its, congener, platinum, is, used, in, catalytic, converters, which, convert, as, much, as, 90, of, the, harmful, gases, in, automobile, exhaust, hydrocarbons, carbon, monoxide, and, nitrogen, dioxide, into, nontoxic, substances, nitrogen, carbon, dioxide, and, water, vapor, palladium, is, also, used, in, electronics, dentistry, medicine, hydrogen, purification, chemical, applications, groundwater, treatment, and, jewelry, palladium, is, a, key, component, of, fuel, cells, in, which, hydrogen, and, oxygen, react, to, produce, electricity, heat, and, water, ore, deposits, of, palladium, and, other, pgms, are, rare, the, most, extensive, deposits, have, been, found, in, the, norite, belt, of, the, bushveld, igneous, complex, covering, the, transvaal, basin, in, south, africa, the, stillwater, complex, in, montana, united, states, the, sudbury, basin, and, thunder, bay, district, of, ontario, canada, and, the, norilsk, complex, in, russia, recycling, is, also, a, source, mostly, from, scrapped, catalytic, converters, the, numerous, applications, and, limited, supply, sources, result, in, considerable, investment, interest, palladium, belongs, to, group, 10, in, the, periodic, table, but, the, configuration, in, the, outermost, electrons, is, in, accordance, with, hund, s, rule, electrons, that, by, the, madelung, rule, would, be, expected, to, occupy, the, 5, s, instead, fill, the, 4, d, orbitals, as, it, is, more, energetically, favorable, to, have, a, completely, filled, 4d, 10, shell, instead, of, the, 5s, 2, 4d, 8, configuration, this, 5s, 0, configuration, unique, in, period, 5, makes, palladium, the, heaviest, element, having, only, one, incomplete, electron, shell, with, all, shells, above, it, empty, palladium, has, the, appearance, of, a, soft, silver, white, metal, that, resembles, platinum, it, is, the, least, dense, and, has, the, lowest, melting, point, of, the, platinum, group, metals, it, is, soft, and, ductile, when, annealed, and, is, greatly, increased, in, strength, and, hardness, when, cold, worked, palladium, dissolves, slowly, in, concentrated, nitric, acid, in, hot, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, and, when, finely, ground, in, hydrochloric, acid, it, dissolves, readily, at, room, temperature, in, aqua, regia, palladium, does, not, react, with, oxygen, at, standard, temperature, and, thus, does, not, tarnish, in, air, palladium, heated, to, 800, c, will, produce, a, layer, of, palladium, ii, oxide, pdo, it, may, slowly, develop, a, slight, brownish, coloration, over, time, likely, due, to, the, formation, of, a, surface, layer, of, its, monoxide, palladium, films, with, defects, produced, by, alpha, particle, bombardment, at, low, temperature, exhibit, superconductivity, having, t, c, 3, 2, k, naturally, occurring, palladium, is, composed, of, seven, isotopes, six, of, which, are, stable, the, most, stable, radioisotopes, are, 107, pd, with, a, half, life, of, 6, 5, million, years, found, in, nature, 103, pd, with, 17, days, and, 100, pd, with, 3, 63, days, eighteen, other, radioisotopes, have, been, characterized, with, atomic, weights, ranging, from, 90, 94948, 64, u, 91, pd, to, 122, 93426, 64, u, 123, pd, these, have, half, lives, of, less, than, thirty, minutes, except, 101, pd, half, life, 8, 47, hours, 109, pd, half, life, 13, 7, hours, and, 112, pd, half, life, 21, hours, for, isotopes, with, atomic, mass, unit, values, less, than, that, of, the, most, abundant, stable, isotope, 106, pd, the, primary, decay, mode, is, electron, capture, with, the, primary, decay, product, being, rhodium, the, primary, mode, of, decay, for, those, isotopes, of, pd, with, atomic, mass, greater, than, 106, is, beta, decay, with, the, primary, product, of, this, decay, being, silver, radiogenic, 107, ag, is, a, decay, product, of, 107, pd, and, was, first, discovered, in, 1978, in, the, santa, clara, meteorite, of, 1976, the, discoverers, suggest, that, the, coalescence, and, differentiation, of, iron, cored, small, planets, may, have, occurred, 10, million, years, after, a, nucleosynthetic, event, 107, pd, versus, ag, correlations, observed, in, bodies, which, have, been, melted, since, accretion, of, the, solar, system, must, reflect, the, presence, of, short, lived, nuclides, in, the, early, solar, system, 107, pd, is, also, produced, as, a, fission, product, in, spontaneous, or, induced, fission, of, 235, u, as, it, is, not, very, mobile, in, the, environment, and, has, a, relatively, low, decay, energy, 107, pd, is, usually, considered, to, be, among, the, less, concerning, of, the, long, lived, fission, products, palladium, compounds, exist, primarily, in, the, 0, and, 2, oxidation, state, other, less, common, states, are, also, recognized, generally, the, compounds, of, palladium, are, more, similar, to, those, of, platinum, than, those, of, any, other, element, palladium, ii, chloride, is, the, principal, starting, material, for, other, palladium, compounds, it, arises, by, the, reaction, of, palladium, with, chlorine, it, is, used, to, prepare, heterogeneous, palladium, catalysts, such, as, palladium, on, barium, sulfate, palladium, on, carbon, and, palladium, chloride, on, carbon, solutions, of, pdcl, 2, in, nitric, acid, react, with, acetic, acid, to, give, palladium, ii, acetate, also, a, versatile, reagent, pdcl, 2, reacts, with, ligands, l, to, give, square, planar, complexes, of, the, type, pdcl, 2, l, 2, one, example, of, such, complexes, is, the, benzonitrile, derivative, pdcl, 2, phcn, 2, the, complex, bis, triphenylphosphine, palladium, ii, dichloride, is, a, useful, catalyst, palladium, forms, a, range, of, zerovalent, complexes, with, the, formula, pdl, 4, pdl, 3, and, pdl, 2, for, example, reduction, of, a, mixture, of, pdcl, 2, pph, 3, 2, and, pph, 3, gives, tetrakis, triphenylphosphine, palladium, 0, another, major, palladium, 0, complex, tris, dibenzylideneacetone, dipalladium, 0, pd, 2, dba, 3, is, prepared, by, reducing, sodium, tetrachloropalladate, in, the, presence, of, dibenzylideneacetone, palladium, 0, as, well, as, palladium, ii, are, catalysts, in, coupling, reactions, as, has, been, recognized, by, the, 2010, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, to, richard, f, heck, ei, ichi, negishi, and, akira, suzuki, such, reactions, are, widely, practiced, for, the, synthesis, of, fine, chemicals, prominent, coupling, reactions, include, the, heck, suzuki, sonogashira, coupling, stille, reactions, and, the, kumada, coupling, palladium, ii, acetate, tetrakis, triphenylphosphine, palladium, 0, pd, pph, 3, 4, and, tris, dibenzylideneacetone, dipalladium, 0, pd, 2, dba, 3, serve, either, as, catalysts, or, precatalysts, although, pd, iv, compounds, are, comparatively, rare, one, example, is, sodium, hexachloropalladate, iv, na, 2, a, few, compounds, of, palladium, iii, are, also, known, palladium, vi, was, claimed, in, 2002, but, subsequently, disproven, mixed, valence, palladium, complexes, exist, e, g, pd, 4, co, 4, oac, 4, pd, acac, 2, forms, an, infinite, pd, chain, structure, with, alternatively, interconnected, pd, 4, co, 4, oac, 4, and, pd, acac, 2, units, when, alloyed, with, a, more, electropositive, element, palladium, can, acquire, a, negative, charge, such, compounds, are, known, as, palladides, such, as, gallium, palladide, palladides, with, the, stoichiometry, rpd, 3, exist, where, r, is, scandium, yttrium, or, any, of, the, lanthanides, as, overall, mine, production, of, palladium, reached, 210, 000, kilograms, in, 2022, russia, was, the, top, producer, with, 88, 000, kilograms, followed, by, south, africa, canada, the, u, s, and, zimbabwe, russia, s, company, norilsk, nickel, ranks, first, among, the, largest, palladium, producers, globally, accounting, for, 39, of, the, world, s, production, palladium, can, be, found, as, a, free, metal, alloyed, with, gold, and, other, platinum, group, metals, in, placer, deposits, of, the, ural, mountains, australia, ethiopia, north, and, south, america, for, the, production, of, palladium, these, deposits, play, only, a, minor, role, the, most, important, commercial, sources, are, nickel, copper, deposits, found, in, the, sudbury, basin, ontario, and, the, norilsk, talnakh, deposits, in, siberia, the, other, large, deposit, is, the, merensky, reef, platinum, group, metals, deposit, within, the, bushveld, igneous, complex, south, africa, the, stillwater, igneous, complex, of, montana, and, the, roby, zone, ore, body, of, the, lac, des, les, igneous, complex, of, ontario, are, the, two, other, sources, of, palladium, in, canada, and, the, united, states, palladium, is, found, in, the, rare, minerals, cooperite, and, polarite, many, more, pd, minerals, are, known, but, all, of, them, are, very, rare, palladium, is, also, produced, in, nuclear, fission, reactors, and, can, be, extracted, from, spent, nuclear, fuel, see, synthesis, of, precious, metals, though, this, source, for, palladium, is, not, used, none, of, the, existing, nuclear, reprocessing, facilities, are, equipped, to, extract, palladium, from, the, high, level, radioactive, waste, a, complication, for, the, recovery, of, palladium, in, spent, fuel, is, the, presence, of, 107, pd, a, slightly, radioactive, long, lived, fission, product, depending, on, end, use, the, radioactivity, contributed, by, the, 107, pd, might, make, the, recovered, palladium, unusable, without, a, costly, step, of, isotope, separation, the, largest, use, of, palladium, today, is, in, catalytic, converters, palladium, is, also, used, in, jewelry, dentistry, watch, making, blood, sugar, test, strips, aircraft, spark, plugs, surgical, instruments, and, electrical, contacts, palladium, is, also, used, to, make, some, professional, transverse, concert, or, classical, flutes, as, a, commodity, palladium, bullion, has, iso, currency, codes, of, xpd, and, 964, palladium, is, one, of, only, four, metals, to, have, such, codes, the, others, being, gold, silver, and, platinum, because, it, adsorbs, hydrogen, palladium, was, a, key, component, of, the, controversial, cold, fusion, experiments, of, the, late, 1980s, when, it, is, finely, divided, as, with, palladium, on, carbon, palladium, forms, a, versatile, catalyst, it, speeds, heterogeneous, catalytic, processes, like, hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and, petroleum, cracking, palladium, is, also, essential, to, the, lindlar, catalyst, also, called, lindlar, s, palladium, a, large, number, of, carbon, carbon, bonding, reactions, in, organic, chemistry, are, facilitated, by, palladium, compound, catalysts, for, example, when, dispersed, on, conductive, materials, palladium, is, an, excellent, electrocatalyst, for, oxidation, of, primary, alcohols, in, alkaline, media, palladium, is, also, a, versatile, metal, for, homogeneous, catalysis, used, in, combination, with, a, broad, variety, of, ligands, for, highly, selective, chemical, transformations, in, 2010, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, was, awarded, for, palladium, catalyzed, cross, couplings, in, organic, synthesis, to, richard, f, heck, ei, ichi, negishi, and, akira, suzuki, a, 2008, study, showed, that, palladium, is, an, effective, catalyst, for, carbon, fluorine, bonds, palladium, catalysis, is, primarily, employed, in, organic, chemistry, and, industrial, applications, although, its, use, is, growing, as, a, tool, for, synthetic, biology, in, 2017, effective, in, vivo, catalytic, activity, of, palladium, nanoparticles, was, demonstrated, in, mammals, to, treat, disease, the, primary, application, of, palladium, in, electronics, is, in, multi, layer, ceramic, capacitors, in, which, palladium, and, palladium, silver, alloy, is, used, for, electrodes, palladium, sometimes, alloyed, with, nickel, is, or, can, be, used, for, component, and, connector, plating, in, consumer, electronics, and, in, soldering, materials, the, electronic, sector, consumed, 33, tonnes, 1, 07, million, troy, ounces, of, palladium, in, 2006, according, to, a, johnson, matthey, report, hydrogen, easily, diffuses, through, heated, palladium, and, membrane, reactors, with, pd, membranes, are, used, in, the, production, of, high, purity, hydrogen, palladium, is, used, in, palladium, hydrogen, electrodes, in, electrochemical, studies, palladium, ii, chloride, readily, catalyzes, carbon, monoxide, gas, to, carbon, dioxide, and, is, useful, in, carbon, monoxide, detectors, palladium, readily, adsorbs, hydrogen, at, room, temperatures, forming, palladium, hydride, pdh, x, with, x, less, than, 1, while, this, property, is, common, to, many, transition, metals, palladium, has, a, uniquely, high, absorption, capacity, and, does, not, lose, its, ductility, until, x, approaches, 1, this, property, has, been, investigated, in, designing, an, efficient, and, safe, hydrogen, fuel, storage, medium, though, palladium, itself, is, currently, prohibitively, expensive, for, this, purpose, the, content, of, hydrogen, in, palladium, can, be, linked, to, magnetic, susceptibility, which, decreases, with, the, increase, of, hydrogen, and, becomes, zero, for, pdh, 0, 62, at, any, higher, ratio, the, solid, solution, becomes, diamagnetic, palladium, is, used, for, purification, of, hydrogen, on, a, laboratory, 183, 217, but, not, industrial, scale, palladium, is, used, in, small, amounts, about, 0, 5, in, some, alloys, of, dental, amalgam, to, decrease, corrosion, and, increase, the, metallic, lustre, of, the, final, restoration, palladium, has, been, used, as, a, precious, metal, in, jewelry, since, 1939, as, an, alternative, to, platinum, in, the, alloys, called, white, gold, where, the, naturally, white, color, of, palladium, does, not, require, rhodium, plating, palladium, being, much, less, dense, than, platinum, is, similar, to, gold, in, that, it, can, be, beaten, into, leaf, as, thin, as, 100, nm, 1, 250, 000, in, unlike, platinum, palladium, may, discolor, at, temperatures, above, 400, c, 752, f, due, to, oxidation, making, it, more, brittle, and, thus, less, suitable, for, use, in, jewelry, to, prevent, this, palladium, intended, for, jewelry, is, heated, under, controlled, conditions, prior, to, 2004, the, principal, use, of, palladium, in, jewelry, was, the, manufacture, of, white, gold, palladium, is, one, of, the, three, most, popular, alloying, metals, in, white, gold, nickel, and, silver, can, also, be, used, palladium, gold, is, more, expensive, than, nickel, gold, but, seldom, causes, allergic, reactions, though, certain, cross, allergies, with, nickel, may, occur, when, platinum, became, a, strategic, resource, during, world, war, ii, many, jewelry, bands, were, made, out, of, palladium, palladium, was, little, used, in, jewelry, because, of, the, technical, difficulty, of, casting, with, the, casting, problem, resolved, the, use, of, palladium, in, jewelry, increased, originally, because, platinum, increased, in, price, while, the, price, of, palladium, decreased, in, early, 2004, when, gold, and, platinum, prices, rose, steeply, china, began, fabricating, volumes, of, palladium, jewelry, consuming, 37, tonnes, in, 2005, subsequent, changes, in, the, relative, price, of, platinum, lowered, demand, for, palladium, to, 17, 4, tonnes, in, 2009, demand, for, palladium, as, a, catalyst, has, increased, the, price, of, palladium, to, about, 50, higher, than, that, of, platinum, in, january, 2019, in, january, 2010, hallmarks, for, palladium, were, introduced, by, assay, offices, in, the, united, kingdom, and, hallmarking, became, mandatory, for, all, jewelry, advertising, pure, or, alloyed, palladium, articles, can, be, marked, as, 500, 950, or, 999, parts, of, palladium, per, thousand, of, the, alloy, fountain, pen, nibs, made, from, gold, are, sometimes, plated, with, palladium, when, a, silver, rather, than, gold, appearance, is, desired, sheaffer, has, used, palladium, plating, for, decades, either, as, an, accent, on, otherwise, gold, nibs, or, covering, the, gold, completely, palladium, is, also, used, by, the, luxury, brand, herm, s, as, one, of, the, metals, plating, the, hardware, on, their, handbags, most, famous, of, which, being, birkin, in, the, platinotype, printing, process, photographers, make, fine, art, black, and, white, prints, using, platinum, or, palladium, salts, often, used, with, platinum, palladium, provides, an, alternative, to, silver, palladium, is, a, metal, with, low, toxicity, as, conventionally, measured, e, g, ld, 50, recent, research, on, the, mechanism, of, palladium, toxicity, suggests, high, toxicity, if, measured, on, a, longer, timeframe, and, at, the, cellular, level, in, the, liver, and, kidney, mitochondria, appear, to, have, a, key, role, in, palladium, toxicity, via, mitochondrial, membrane, potential, collapse, and, depletion, of, the, cellular, glutathione, gsh, level, until, that, recent, work, it, had, been, thought, that, palladium, was, poorly, absorbed, by, the, human, body, when, ingested, plants, such, as, the, water, hyacinth, are, killed, by, low, levels, of, palladium, salts, but, most, other, plants, tolerate, it, although, tests, show, that, at, levels, above, 0, 0003, growth, is, affected, high, doses, of, palladium, could, be, poisonous, tests, on, rodents, suggest, it, may, be, carcinogenic, though, until, the, recent, research, cited, above, no, clear, evidence, indicated, that, the, element, harms, humans, like, other, platinum, group, metals, bulk, pd, is, quite, inert, although, contact, dermatitis, has, been, reported, data, on, the, effects, are, limited, it, has, been, shown, that, people, with, an, allergic, reaction, to, palladium, also, react, to, nickel, making, it, advisable, to, avoid, the, use, of, dental, alloys, containing, palladium, on, those, so, allergic, some, palladium, is, emitted, with, the, exhaust, gases, of, cars, with, catalytic, converters, between, 4, and, 108, ng, km, of, palladium, particulate, is, released, by, such, cars, while, the, total, uptake, from, food, is, estimated, to, be, less, than, 2, g, per, person, a, day, the, second, possible, source, of, palladium, is, dental, restoration, from, which, the, uptake, of, palladium, is, estimated, to, be, less, than, 15, g, per, person, per, day, people, working, with, palladium, or, its, compounds, might, have, a, considerably, greater, uptake, for, soluble, compounds, such, as, palladium, chloride, 99, is, eliminated, from, the, body, within, three, days, the, median, lethal, dose, ld, 50, of, soluble, palladium, compounds, in, mice, is, 200, mg, kg, for, oral, and, 5, mg, kg, for, intravenous, administration, william, hyde, wollaston, noted, the, discovery, of, a, new, noble, metal, in, july, 1802, in, his, lab, book, and, named, it, palladium, in, august, of, the, same, year, he, named, the, element, after, the, asteroid, 2, pallas, which, had, been, discovered, two, months, earlier, and, which, was, previously, considered, a, planet, wollaston, purified, a, quantity, of, the, material, and, offered, it, without, naming, the, discoverer, in, a, small, shop, in, soho, in, april, 1803, after, harsh, criticism, from, richard, chenevix, who, claimed, that, palladium, was, an, alloy, of, platinum, and, mercury, wollaston, anonymously, offered, a, reward, of, 20, for, 20, grains, of, synthetic, palladium, alloy, chenevix, received, the, copley, medal, in, 1803, after, he, published, his, experiments, on, palladium, wollaston, published, the, discovery, of, rhodium, in, 1804, and, mentions, some, of, his, work, on, palladium, he, disclosed, that, he, was, the, discoverer, of, palladium, in, a, publication, in, 1805, wollaston, found, palladium, in, crude, platinum, ore, from, south, america, by, dissolving, the, ore, in, aqua, regia, neutralizing, the, solution, with, sodium, hydroxide, and, precipitating, platinum, as, ammonium, chloroplatinate, with, ammonium, chloride, he, added, mercuric, cyanide, to, form, the, compound, palladium, ii, cyanide, which, was, heated, to, extract, palladium, metal, palladium, chloride, was, at, one, time, prescribed, as, a, tuberculosis, treatment, at, the, rate, of, 0, 065, g, per, day, approximately, one, milligram, per, kilogram, of, body, weight, this, treatment, had, many, negative, side, effects, and, was, later, replaced, by, more, effective, drugs, most, palladium, is, used, for, catalytic, converters, in, the, automobile, industry, catalytic, converters, are, targets, for, thieves, because, they, contain, palladium, and, other, rare, metals, in, the, run, up, to, year, 2000, the, russian, supply, of, palladium, to, the, global, market, was, repeatedly, delayed, and, disrupted, for, political, reasons, the, export, quota, was, not, granted, on, time, the, ensuing, market, panic, drove, the, price, to, an, all, time, high, of, 1, 340, per, troy, ounce, 43, g, in, january, 2001, around, that, time, the, ford, motor, company, fearing, that, automobile, production, would, be, disrupted, by, a, palladium, shortage, stockpiled, the, metal, when, prices, fell, in, early, 2001, ford, lost, nearly, us, 1, billion, world, demand, for, palladium, increased, from, 100, tons, in, 1990, to, nearly, 300, tons, in, 2000, the, global, production, of, palladium, from, mines, was, 222, tonnes, in, 2006, according, to, the, united, states, geological, survey, many, were, concerned, about, a, steady, supply, of, palladium, in, the, wake, of, russia, s, annexation, of, crimea, partly, as, sanctions, could, hamper, russian, palladium, exports, any, restrictions, on, russian, palladium, exports, could, have, exacerbated, what, was, already, expected, to, be, a, large, palladium, deficit, in, 2014, those, concerns, pushed, palladium, prices, to, their, highest, level, since, 2001, in, september, 2014, they, soared, above, the, 900, per, ounce, mark, in, 2016, however, palladium, cost, around, 614, per, ounce, as, russia, managed, to, maintain, stable, supplies, in, january, 2019, palladium, futures, climbed, past, 1, 344, per, ounce, for, the, first, time, on, record, mainly, due, to, the, strong, demand, from, the, automotive, industry, palladium, reached, 2, 024, 64, per, troy, ounce, 65, 094, g, on, 6, january, 2020, passing, 2, 000, per, troy, ounce, the, first, time, the, price, rose, above, 3, 000, per, troy, ounce, in, may, 2021, and, march, 2022, global, palladium, sales, were, 8, 84, million, troy, ounces, 275, t, in, 2017, of, which, 86, was, used, in, the, manufacturing, of, automotive, catalytic, converters, followed, by, industrial, jewelry, and, investment, usages, more, than, 75, of, global, platinum, and, 40, of, palladium, are, mined, in, south, africa, russia, s, mining, company, norilsk, nickel, produces, another, 44, of, palladium, with, us, and, canada, based, mines, producing, most, of, the, rest, the, price, for, palladium, reached, an, all, time, high, of, 2, 981, 40, per, ounce, on, may, 3, 2021, driven, mainly, on, speculation, of, the, catalytic, converter, demand, from, the, automobile, industry, palladium, is, traded, in, the, spot, market, with, the, code, xpd, when, settled, in, usd, the, code, is, xpdusd, a, later, surplus, of, the, metal, was, caused, by, the, russian, government, selling, stockpiles, from, the, soviet, era, at, a, rate, of, about, 1, 6, to, 2, million, troy, ounces, 50, to, 62, t, a, year, the, amount, and, status, of, this, stockpile, are, a, state, secret, during, the, russo, ukrainian, war, in, march, 2022, prices, for, palladium, increased, 13, since, the, first, of, march, russia, is, the, primary, supplier, to, europe, and, the, country, supplies, 37, of, the, global, production, wisdomtree, physical, palladium, lse, phpd, is, backed, by, allocated, palladium, bullion, and, was, the, world, s, first, palladium, etf, it, is, listed, on, the, london, stock, exchange, as, phpd, xetra, trading, system, euronext, and, milan, etfs, physical, palladium, shares, nyse, pall, is, an, etf, traded, on, the, new, york, stock, exchange, a, traditional, way, of, investing, in, palladium, is, buying, bullion, coins, and, bars, made, of, palladium, available, palladium, coins, include, the, canadian, palladium, maple, leaf, the, chinese, panda, and, the, american, palladium, eagle, the, liquidity, of, direct, palladium, bullion, investment, is, poorer, than, that, of, gold, and, silver, because, there, is, low, circulation, of, palladium, coins
