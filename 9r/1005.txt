surface, tension, is, the, tendency, of, liquid, surfaces, at, rest, to, shrink, into, the, minimum, surface, area, possible, surface, tension, is, what, allows, objects, with, a, higher, density, than, water, such, as, razor, blades, and, insects, e, g, water, striders, to, float, on, a, water, surface, without, becoming, even, partly, submerged, at, liquid, air, interfaces, surface, tension, results, from, the, greater, attraction, of, liquid, molecules, to, each, other, due, to, cohesion, than, to, the, molecules, in, the, air, due, to, adhesion, there, are, two, primary, mechanisms, in, play, one, is, an, inward, force, on, the, surface, molecules, causing, the, liquid, to, contract, second, is, a, tangential, force, parallel, to, the, surface, of, the, liquid, this, tangential, force, is, generally, referred, to, as, the, surface, tension, the, net, effect, is, the, liquid, behaves, as, if, its, surface, were, covered, with, a, stretched, elastic, membrane, but, this, analogy, must, not, be, taken, too, far, as, the, tension, in, an, elastic, membrane, is, dependent, on, the, amount, of, deformation, of, the, membrane, while, surface, tension, is, an, inherent, property, of, the, liquid, air, or, liquid, vapour, interface, because, of, the, relatively, high, attraction, of, water, molecules, to, each, other, through, a, web, of, hydrogen, bonds, water, has, a, higher, surface, tension, 72, 8, millinewtons, mn, per, meter, at, 20, c, than, most, other, liquids, surface, tension, is, an, important, factor, in, the, phenomenon, of, capillarity, surface, tension, has, the, dimension, of, force, per, unit, length, or, of, energy, per, unit, area, the, two, are, equivalent, but, when, referring, to, energy, per, unit, of, area, it, is, common, to, use, the, term, surface, energy, which, is, a, more, general, term, in, the, sense, that, it, applies, also, to, solids, in, materials, science, surface, tension, is, used, for, either, surface, stress, or, surface, energy, due, to, the, cohesive, forces, a, molecule, located, away, from, the, surface, is, pulled, equally, in, every, direction, by, neighboring, liquid, molecules, resulting, in, a, net, force, of, zero, the, molecules, at, the, surface, do, not, have, the, same, molecules, on, all, sides, of, them, and, therefore, are, pulled, inward, this, creates, some, internal, pressure, and, forces, liquid, surfaces, to, contract, to, the, minimum, area, there, is, also, a, tension, parallel, to, the, surface, at, the, liquid, air, interface, which, will, resist, an, external, force, due, to, the, cohesive, nature, of, water, molecules, the, forces, of, attraction, acting, between, molecules, of, the, same, type, are, called, cohesive, forces, while, those, acting, between, molecules, of, different, types, are, called, adhesive, forces, the, balance, between, the, cohesion, of, the, liquid, and, its, adhesion, to, the, material, of, the, container, determines, the, degree, of, wetting, the, contact, angle, and, the, shape, of, meniscus, when, cohesion, dominates, specifically, adhesion, energy, is, less, than, half, of, cohesion, energy, the, wetting, is, low, and, the, meniscus, is, convex, at, a, vertical, wall, as, for, mercury, in, a, glass, container, on, the, other, hand, when, adhesion, dominates, when, adhesion, energy, is, more, than, half, of, cohesion, energy, the, wetting, is, high, and, the, similar, meniscus, is, concave, as, in, water, in, a, glass, surface, tension, is, responsible, for, the, shape, of, liquid, droplets, although, easily, deformed, droplets, of, water, tend, to, be, pulled, into, a, spherical, shape, by, the, imbalance, in, cohesive, forces, of, the, surface, layer, in, the, absence, of, other, forces, drops, of, virtually, all, liquids, would, be, approximately, spherical, the, spherical, shape, minimizes, the, necessary, wall, tension, of, the, surface, layer, according, to, laplace, s, law, another, way, to, view, surface, tension, is, in, terms, of, energy, a, molecule, in, contact, with, a, neighbor, is, in, a, lower, state, of, energy, than, if, it, were, alone, the, interior, molecules, have, as, many, neighbors, as, they, can, possibly, have, but, the, boundary, molecules, are, missing, neighbors, compared, to, interior, molecules, and, therefore, have, higher, energy, for, the, liquid, to, minimize, its, energy, state, the, number, of, higher, energy, boundary, molecules, must, be, minimized, the, minimized, number, of, boundary, molecules, results, in, a, minimal, surface, area, as, a, result, of, surface, area, minimization, a, surface, will, assume, a, smooth, shape, surface, tension, represented, by, the, symbol, alternatively, or, t, is, measured, in, force, per, unit, length, its, si, unit, is, newton, per, meter, but, the, cgs, unit, of, dyne, per, centimeter, is, also, used, for, example, 1, d, y, n, c, m, 1, e, r, g, c, m, 2, 1, 10, 7, m, n, 10, 4, m, 2, 0, 001, n, m, 0, 001, j, m, 2, displaystyle, gamma, 1, mathrm, frac, dyn, cm, 1, mathrm, frac, erg, cm, 2, 1, mathrm, frac, 10, 7, m, cdot, n, 10, 4, m, 2, 0, 001, mathrm, frac, n, m, 0, 001, mathrm, frac, j, m, 2, surface, tension, can, be, defined, in, terms, of, force, or, energy, surface, tension, of, a, liquid, is, the, force, per, unit, length, in, the, illustration, on, the, right, the, rectangular, frame, composed, of, three, unmovable, sides, black, that, form, a, u, shape, and, a, fourth, movable, side, blue, that, can, slide, to, the, right, surface, tension, will, pull, the, blue, bar, to, the, left, the, force, f, required, to, hold, the, movable, side, is, proportional, to, the, length, l, of, the, immobile, side, thus, the, ratio, f, l, depends, only, on, the, intrinsic, properties, of, the, liquid, composition, temperature, etc, not, on, its, geometry, for, example, if, the, frame, had, a, more, complicated, shape, the, ratio, f, l, with, l, the, length, of, the, movable, side, and, f, the, force, required, to, stop, it, from, sliding, is, found, to, be, the, same, for, all, shapes, we, therefore, define, the, surface, tension, as, f, 2, l, displaystyle, gamma, frac, f, 2l, the, reason, for, the, 1, 2, is, that, the, film, has, two, sides, two, surfaces, each, of, which, contributes, equally, to, the, force, so, the, force, contributed, by, a, single, side, is, l, f, 2, surface, tension, of, a, liquid, is, the, ratio, of, the, change, in, the, energy, of, the, liquid, to, the, change, in, the, surface, area, of, the, liquid, that, led, to, the, change, in, energy, this, can, be, easily, related, to, the, previous, definition, in, terms, of, force, if, f, is, the, force, required, to, stop, the, side, from, starting, to, slide, then, this, is, also, the, force, that, would, keep, the, side, in, the, state, of, sliding, at, a, constant, speed, by, newton, s, second, law, but, if, the, side, is, moving, to, the, right, in, the, direction, the, force, is, applied, then, the, surface, area, of, the, stretched, liquid, is, increasing, while, the, applied, force, is, doing, work, on, the, liquid, this, means, that, increasing, the, surface, area, increases, the, energy, of, the, film, the, work, done, by, the, force, f, in, moving, the, side, by, distance, x, is, w, f, x, at, the, same, time, the, total, area, of, the, film, increases, by, a, 2, l, x, the, factor, of, 2, is, here, because, the, liquid, has, two, sides, two, surfaces, thus, multiplying, both, the, numerator, and, the, denominator, of, 1, 2, f, l, by, x, we, get, f, 2, l, f, x, 2, l, x, w, a, displaystyle, gamma, frac, f, 2l, frac, f, delta, x, 2l, delta, x, frac, w, delta, a, this, work, w, is, by, the, usual, arguments, interpreted, as, being, stored, as, potential, energy, consequently, surface, tension, can, be, also, measured, in, si, system, as, joules, per, square, meter, and, in, the, cgs, system, as, ergs, per, cm, 2, since, mechanical, systems, try, to, find, a, state, of, minimum, potential, energy, a, free, droplet, of, liquid, naturally, assumes, a, spherical, shape, which, has, the, minimum, surface, area, for, a, given, volume, the, equivalence, of, measurement, of, energy, per, unit, area, to, force, per, unit, length, can, be, proven, by, dimensional, analysis, several, effects, of, surface, tension, can, be, seen, with, ordinary, water, surface, tension, is, visible, in, other, common, phenomena, especially, when, surfactants, are, used, to, decrease, it, if, no, force, acts, normal, to, a, tensioned, surface, the, surface, must, remain, flat, but, if, the, pressure, on, one, side, of, the, surface, differs, from, pressure, on, the, other, side, the, pressure, difference, times, surface, area, results, in, a, normal, force, in, order, for, the, surface, tension, forces, to, cancel, the, force, due, to, pressure, the, surface, must, be, curved, the, diagram, shows, how, surface, curvature, of, a, tiny, patch, of, surface, leads, to, a, net, component, of, surface, tension, forces, acting, normal, to, the, center, of, the, patch, when, all, the, forces, are, balanced, the, resulting, equation, is, known, as, the, young, laplace, equation, p, 1, r, x, 1, r, y, displaystyle, delta, p, gamma, left, frac, 1, r, x, frac, 1, r, y, right, where, the, quantity, in, parentheses, on, the, right, hand, side, is, in, fact, twice, the, mean, curvature, of, the, surface, depending, on, normalisation, solutions, to, this, equation, determine, the, shape, of, water, drops, puddles, menisci, soap, bubbles, and, all, other, shapes, determined, by, surface, tension, such, as, the, shape, of, the, impressions, that, a, water, strider, s, feet, make, on, the, surface, of, a, pond, the, table, below, shows, how, the, internal, pressure, of, a, water, droplet, increases, with, decreasing, radius, for, not, very, small, drops, the, effect, is, subtle, but, the, pressure, difference, becomes, enormous, when, the, drop, sizes, approach, the, molecular, size, in, the, limit, of, a, single, molecule, the, concept, becomes, meaningless, when, an, object, is, placed, on, a, liquid, its, weight, f, w, depresses, the, surface, and, if, surface, tension, and, downward, force, become, equal, then, it, is, balanced, by, the, surface, tension, forces, on, either, side, f, s, which, are, each, parallel, to, the, water, s, surface, at, the, points, where, it, contacts, the, object, notice, that, small, movement, in, the, body, may, cause, the, object, to, sink, as, the, angle, of, contact, decreases, surface, tension, decreases, the, horizontal, components, of, the, two, f, s, arrows, point, in, opposite, directions, so, they, cancel, each, other, but, the, vertical, components, point, in, the, same, direction, and, therefore, add, up, to, balance, f, w, the, object, s, surface, must, not, be, wettable, for, this, to, happen, and, its, weight, must, be, low, enough, for, the, surface, tension, to, support, it, if, m, denotes, the, mass, of, the, needle, and, g, acceleration, due, to, gravity, we, have, f, w, 2, f, s, sin, m, g, 2, l, sin, displaystyle, f, mathrm, w, 2f, mathrm, s, sin, theta, quad, leftrightarrow, quad, mg, 2, gamma, l, sin, theta, to, find, the, shape, of, the, minimal, surface, bounded, by, some, arbitrary, shaped, frame, using, strictly, mathematical, means, can, be, a, daunting, task, yet, by, fashioning, the, frame, out, of, wire, and, dipping, it, in, soap, solution, a, locally, minimal, surface, will, appear, in, the, resulting, soap, film, within, seconds, the, reason, for, this, is, that, the, pressure, difference, across, a, fluid, interface, is, proportional, to, the, mean, curvature, as, seen, in, the, young, laplace, equation, for, an, open, soap, film, the, pressure, difference, is, zero, hence, the, mean, curvature, is, zero, and, minimal, surfaces, have, the, property, of, zero, mean, curvature, the, surface, of, any, liquid, is, an, interface, between, that, liquid, and, some, other, medium, the, top, surface, of, a, pond, for, example, is, an, interface, between, the, pond, water, and, the, air, surface, tension, then, is, not, a, property, of, the, liquid, alone, but, a, property, of, the, liquid, s, interface, with, another, medium, if, a, liquid, is, in, a, container, then, besides, the, liquid, air, interface, at, its, top, surface, there, is, also, an, interface, between, the, liquid, and, the, walls, of, the, container, the, surface, tension, between, the, liquid, and, air, is, usually, different, greater, than, its, surface, tension, with, the, walls, of, a, container, and, where, the, two, surfaces, meet, their, geometry, must, be, such, that, all, forces, balance, where, the, two, surfaces, meet, they, form, a, contact, angle, which, is, the, angle, the, tangent, to, the, surface, makes, with, the, solid, surface, note, that, the, angle, is, measured, through, the, liquid, as, shown, in, the, diagrams, above, the, diagram, to, the, right, shows, two, examples, tension, forces, are, shown, for, the, liquid, air, interface, the, liquid, solid, interface, and, the, solid, air, interface, the, example, on, the, left, is, where, the, difference, between, the, liquid, solid, and, solid, air, surface, tension, ls, sa, is, less, than, the, liquid, air, surface, tension, la, but, is, nevertheless, positive, that, is, l, a, l, s, s, a, 0, displaystyle, gamma, mathrm, la, gamma, mathrm, ls, gamma, mathrm, sa, 0, in, the, diagram, both, the, vertical, and, horizontal, forces, must, cancel, exactly, at, the, contact, point, known, as, equilibrium, the, horizontal, component, of, f, la, is, canceled, by, the, adhesive, force, f, a, f, a, f, l, a, sin, displaystyle, f, mathrm, a, f, mathrm, la, sin, theta, the, more, telling, balance, of, forces, though, is, in, the, vertical, direction, the, vertical, component, of, f, la, must, exactly, cancel, the, difference, of, the, forces, along, the, solid, surface, f, ls, f, sa, f, l, s, f, s, a, f, l, a, cos, displaystyle, f, mathrm, ls, f, mathrm, sa, f, mathrm, la, cos, theta, since, the, forces, are, in, direct, proportion, to, their, respective, surface, tensions, we, also, have, l, s, s, a, l, a, cos, displaystyle, gamma, mathrm, ls, gamma, mathrm, sa, gamma, mathrm, la, cos, theta, where, this, means, that, although, the, difference, between, the, liquid, solid, and, solid, air, surface, tension, ls, sa, is, difficult, to, measure, directly, it, can, be, inferred, from, the, liquid, air, surface, tension, la, and, the, equilibrium, contact, angle, which, is, a, function, of, the, easily, measurable, advancing, and, receding, contact, angles, see, main, article, contact, angle, this, same, relationship, exists, in, the, diagram, on, the, right, but, in, this, case, we, see, that, because, the, contact, angle, is, less, than, 90, the, liquid, solid, solid, air, surface, tension, difference, must, be, negative, l, a, 0, l, s, s, a, displaystyle, gamma, mathrm, la, 0, gamma, mathrm, ls, gamma, mathrm, sa, observe, that, in, the, special, case, of, a, water, silver, interface, where, the, contact, angle, is, equal, to, 90, the, liquid, solid, solid, air, surface, tension, difference, is, exactly, zero, another, special, case, is, where, the, contact, angle, is, exactly, 180, water, with, specially, prepared, teflon, approaches, this, contact, angle, of, 180, occurs, when, the, liquid, solid, surface, tension, is, exactly, equal, to, the, liquid, air, surface, tension, l, a, l, s, s, a, 0, 180,

diameter, partially, filled, with, mercury, and, with, a, vacuum, called, torricelli, s, vacuum, in, the, unfilled, volume, see, diagram, to, the, right, notice, that, the, mercury, level, at, the, center, of, the, tube, is, higher, than, at, the, edges, making, the, upper, surface, of, the, mercury, dome, shaped, the, center, of, mass, of, the, entire, column, of, mercury, would, be, slightly, lower, if, the, top, surface, of, the, mercury, were, flat, over, the, entire, cross, section, of, the, tube, but, the, dome, shaped, top, gives, slightly, less, surface, area, to, the, entire, mass, of, mercury, again, the, two, effects, combine, to, minimize, the, total, potential, energy, such, a, surface, shape, is, known, as, a, convex, meniscus, we, consider, the, surface, area, of, the, entire, mass, of, mercury, including, the, part, of, the, surface, that, is, in, contact, with, the, glass, because, mercury, does, not, adhere, to, glass, at, all, so, the, surface, tension, of, the, mercury, acts, over, its, entire, surface, area, including, where, it, is, in, contact, with, the, glass, if, instead, of, glass, the, tube, was, made, out, of, copper, the, situation, would, be, very, different, mercury, aggressively, adheres, to, copper, so, in, a, copper, tube, the, level, of, mercury, at, the, center, of, the, tube, will, be, lower, than, at, the, edges, that, is, it, would, be, a, concave, meniscus, in, a, situation, where, the, liquid, adheres, to, the, walls, of, its, container, we, consider, the, part, of, the, fluid, s, surface, area, that, is, in, contact, with, the, container, to, have, negative, surface, tension, the, fluid, then, works, to, maximize, the, contact, surface, area, so, in, this, case, increasing, the, area, in, contact, with, the, container, decreases, rather, than, increases, the, potential, energy, that, decrease, is, enough, to, compensate, for, the, increased, potential, energy, associated, with, lifting, the, fluid, near, the, walls, of, the, container, if, a, tube, is, sufficiently, narrow, and, the, liquid, adhesion, to, its, walls, is, sufficiently, strong, surface, tension, can, draw, liquid, up, the, tube, in, a, phenomenon, known, as, capillary, action, the, height, to, which, the, column, is, lifted, is, given, by, jurin, s, law, h, 2, l, a, cos, g, r, displaystyle, h, frac, 2, gamma, mathrm, la, cos, theta, rho, gr, where, pouring, mercury, onto, a, horizontal, flat, sheet, of, glass, results, in, a, puddle, that, has, a, perceptible, thickness, the, puddle, will, spread, out, only, to, the, point, where, it, is, a, little, under, half, a, centimetre, thick, and, no, thinner, again, this, is, due, to, the, action, of, mercury, s, strong, surface, tension, the, liquid, mass, flattens, out, because, that, brings, as, much, of, the, mercury, to, as, low, a, level, as, possible, but, the, surface, tension, at, the, same, time, is, acting, to, reduce, the, total, surface, area, the, result, of, the, compromise, is, a, puddle, of, a, nearly, fixed, thickness, the, same, surface, tension, demonstration, can, be, done, with, water, lime, water, or, even, saline, but, only, on, a, surface, made, of, a, substance, to, which, water, does, not, adhere, wax, is, such, a, substance, water, poured, onto, a, smooth, flat, horizontal, wax, surface, say, a, waxed, sheet, of, glass, will, behave, similarly, to, the, mercury, poured, onto, glass, the, thickness, of, a, puddle, of, liquid, on, a, surface, whose, contact, angle, is, 180, is, given, by, h, 2, g, displaystyle, h, 2, sqrt, frac, gamma, g, rho, where, in, reality, the, thicknesses, of, the, puddles, will, be, slightly, less, than, what, is, predicted, by, the, above, formula, because, very, few, surfaces, have, a, contact, angle, of, 180, with, any, liquid, when, the, contact, angle, is, less, than, 180, the, thickness, is, given, by, h, 2, l, a, 1, cos, g, displaystyle, h, sqrt, frac, 2, gamma, mathrm, la, left, 1,

and, 107, which, gives, h, h, 2, o, 0, 44, cm, the, formula, also, predicts, that, when, the, contact, angle, is, 0, the, liquid, will, spread, out, into, a, micro, thin, layer, over, the, surface, such, a, surface, is, said, to, be, fully, wettable, by, the, liquid, in, day, to, day, life, all, of, us, observe, that, a, stream, of, water, emerging, from, a, faucet, will, break, up, into, droplets, no, matter, how, smoothly, the, stream, is, emitted, from, the, faucet, this, is, due, to, a, phenomenon, called, the, plateau, rayleigh, instability, which, is, entirely, a, consequence, of, the, effects, of, surface, tension, the, explanation, of, this, instability, begins, with, the, existence, of, tiny, perturbations, in, the, stream, these, are, always, present, no, matter, how, smooth, the, stream, is, if, the, perturbations, are, resolved, into, sinusoidal, components, we, find, that, some, components, grow, with, time, while, others, decay, with, time, among, those, that, grow, with, time, some, grow, at, faster, rates, than, others, whether, a, component, decays, or, grows, and, how, fast, it, grows, is, entirely, a, function, of, its, wave, number, a, measure, of,

provided, it, is, not, coupled, to, any, other, energy, changes, it, follows, that, in, order, to, increase, surface, area, a, certain, amount, of, energy, must, be, added, gibbs, and, other, scientists, have, wrestled, with, the, arbitrariness, in, the, exact, microscopic, placement, of, the, surface, for, microscopic, surfaces, with, very, tight, curvatures, it, is, not, correct, to, assume, the, surface, tension, is, independent, of, size, and, topics, like, the, tolman, length, come, into, play, for, a, macroscopic, sized, surface, and, planar, surfaces, the, surface, placement, does, not, have, a, significant, effect, on, however, it, does, have, a, very, strong, effect, on, the, values, of, the, surface, entropy, surface, excess, mass, densities, and, surface, internal, energy, 237, which, are, the, partial, derivatives, of, the, surface, tension, function, t, 1, 2, displaystyle, gamma, t, mu, 1, mu, 2, cdots, gibbs, emphasized, that, for, solids, the, surface, free, energy, may, be, completely, different, from, surface, stress, what, he, called, surface, tension, 315, the, surface, free, energy, is, the, work, required, to, form, the, surface, while, surface, stress, is, the, work, required, to, stretch, the, surface, in, the, case, of, a, two, fluid, interface, there, is, no, distinction, between, forming, and, stretching, because, the, fluids, and, the, surface, completely, replenish, their, nature, when, the, surface, is, stretched, for, a, solid, stretching, the, surface, even, elastically, results, in, a, fundamentally, changed, surface, further, the, surface, stress, on, a, solid, is, a, directional, quantity, a, stress, tensor, while, surface, energy, is, scalar, fifteen, years, after, gibbs, j, d, van, der, waals, developed, the, theory, of, capillarity, effects, based, on, the, hypothesis, of, a, continuous, variation, of, density, he, added, to, the, energy, density, the, term, c, 2, displaystyle, c, nabla, rho, 2, where, c, is, the, capillarity, coefficient, and, is, the, density, for, the, multiphase, equilibria, the, results, of, the, van, der, waals, approach, practically, coincide, with, the, gibbs, formulae, but, for, modelling, of, the, dynamics, of, phase, transitions, the, van, der, waals, approach, is, much, more, convenient, the, van, der, waals, capillarity, energy, is, now, widely, used, in, the, phase, field, models, of, multiphase, flows, such, terms, are, also, discovered, in, the, dynamics, of, non, equilibrium, gases, the, pressure, inside, an, ideal, spherical, bubble, can, be, derived, from, thermodynamic, free, energy, considerations, the, above, free, energy, can, be, written, as, p, v, a, p, b, v, a, displaystyle, omega, delta, pv, text, a, p, text, b, v, gamma, a, where, p, p, a, p, b, displaystyle, delta, p, p, text, a, p, text, b, is, the, pressure, difference, between, the, inside, a, and, outside, b, of, the, bubble, and, v, a, displaystyle, v, text, a, is, the, bubble, volume, in, equilibrium, d, 0, and, so, p, d, v, a, d, a, displaystyle, delta, p, dv, text, a, gamma, da, for, a, spherical, bubble, the, volume, and, surface, area, are, given, simply, by, v, a, 4, 3, r, 3, d, v, a, 4, r, 2, d, r, displaystyle, v, text, a, tfrac, 4, 3, pi, r, 3, quad, rightarrow, quad, dv, text, a, 4, pi, r, 2, dr, and, a, 4, r, 2, d, a, 8, r, d, r, displaystyle, a, 4, pi, r, 2, quad, rightarrow, quad, da, 8, pi, r, dr, substituting, these, relations, into, the, previous, expression, we, find, p, 2, r, displaystyle, delta, p, frac, 2, r, gamma, which, is, equivalent, to, the, young, laplace, equation, when, r, x, r, y, surface, tension, is, dependent, on, temperature, for, that, reason, when, a, value, is, given, for, the, surface, tension, of, an, interface, temperature, must, be, explicitly, stated, the, general, trend, is, that, surface, tension, decreases, with, the, increase, of, temperature, reaching, a, value, of, 0, at, the, critical, temperature, for, further, details, see, e, tv, s, rule, there, are, only, empirical, equations, to, relate, surface, tension, and, temperature, both, guggenheim, katayama, and, e, tv, s, take, into, account, the, fact, that, surface, tension, reaches, 0, at, the, critical, temperature, whereas, ramay, and, shields, fails, to, match, reality, at, this, endpoint, solutes, can, have, different, effects, on, surface, tension, depending, on, the, nature, of, the, surface, and, the, solute, what, complicates, the, effect, is, that, a, solute, can, exist, in, a, different, concentration, at, the, surface, of, a, solvent, than, in, its, bulk, this, difference, varies, from, one, solute, solvent, combination, to, another, gibbs, isotherm, states, that, 1, r, t, ln, c, t, p, displaystyle, gamma, frac, 1, rt, left, frac, partial, gamma, partial, ln, c, right, t, p, certain, assumptions, are, taken, in, its, deduction, therefore, gibbs, isotherm, can, only, be, applied, to, ideal, very, dilute, solutions, with, two, components, the, clausius, clapeyron, relation, leads, to, another, equation, also, attributed, to, kelvin, as, the, kelvin, equation, it, explains, why, because, of, surface, tension, the, vapor, pressure, for, small, droplets, of, liquid, in, suspension, is, greater, than, standard, vapor, pressure, of, that, same, liquid, when, the, interface, is, flat, that, is, to, say, that, when, a, liquid, is, forming, small, droplets, the, equilibrium, concentration, of, its, vapor, in, its, surroundings, is, greater, this, arises, because, the, pressure, inside, the, droplet, is, greater, than, outside, p, v, f, o, g, p, v, e, v, 2, r, t, r, k, displaystyle, p, mathrm, v, mathrm, fog, p, mathrm, v, circ, e, v2, gamma, rtr, mathrm, k, the, effect, explains, supersaturation, of, vapors, in, the, absence, of, nucleation, sites, tiny, droplets, must, form, before, they, can, evolve, into, larger, droplets, this, requires, a, vapor, pressure, many, times, the, vapor, pressure, at, the, phase, transition, point, this, equation, is, also, used, in, catalyst, chemistry, to, assess, mesoporosity, for, solids, the, effect, can, be, viewed, in, terms, of, the, average, number, of, molecular, neighbors, of, surface, molecules, see, diagram, the, table, shows, some, calculated, values, of, this, effect, for, water, at, different, drop, sizes, the, effect, becomes, clear, for, very, small, drop, sizes, as, a, drop, of, 1, nm, radius, has, about, 100, molecules, inside, which, is, a, quantity, small, enough, to, require, a, quantum, mechanics, analysis, because, surface, tension, manifests, itself, in, various, effects, it, offers, a, number, of, paths, to, its, measurement, which, method, is, optimal, depends, upon, the, nature, of, the, liquid, being, measured, the, conditions, under, which, its, tension, is, to, be, measured, and, the, stability, of, its, surface, when, it, is, deformed, an, instrument, that, measures, surface, tension, is, called, tensiometer, the, surface, tension, of, pure, liquid, water, in, contact, with, its, vapor, has, been, given, by, iapws, as, w, 235, 8, 1, t, t, c, 1, 256, 1, 0, 625, 1, t, t, c, mn, m, displaystyle, gamma, text,

the, entire, vapor, liquid, saturation, curve, from, the, triple, point, 0, 01, c, to, the, critical, point, it, also, provides, reasonable, results, when, extrapolated, to, metastable, supercooled, conditions, down, to, at, least, 25, c, this, formulation, was, originally, adopted, by, iapws, in, 1976, and, was, adjusted, in, 1994, to, conform, to, the, international, temperature, scale, of, 1990, the, uncertainty, of, this, formulation, is, given, over, the, full, range, of, temperature, by, iapws, for, temperatures, below, 100, c, the, uncertainty, is, 0, 5, nayar, et, al, published, reference, data, for, the, surface, tension, of, seawater, over, the, salinity, range, of, 20, s, 131, g, kg, and, a, temperature, range, of, 1, t, 92, c, at, atmospheric, pressure, the, range, of, temperature, and, salinity, encompasses, both, the, oceanographic, range, and, the, range, of, conditions, encountered, in, thermal, desalination, technologies, the, uncertainty, of, the, measurements, varied, from, 0, 18, to, 0, 37, mn, m, with, the, average, uncertainty, being, 0, 22, mn, m, nayar, et, al, correlated, the, data, with, the, following, equation, s, w, w, 1, 3, 766, 10,

this, correlation, as, an, international, standard, guideline
