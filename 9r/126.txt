sagittarius, a, abbreviated, as, sgr, a, s, d, e, s, t, r, sadge, ay, star, is, the, supermassive, black, hole, at, the, galactic, center, of, the, milky, way, viewed, from, earth, it, is, located, near, the, border, of, the, constellations, sagittarius, and, scorpius, about, 5, 6, south, of, the, ecliptic, visually, close, to, the, butterfly, cluster, m6, and, lambda, scorpii, the, object, is, a, bright, and, very, compact, astronomical, radio, source, the, name, sagittarius, a, distinguishes, the, compact, source, from, the, larger, and, much, brighter, sagittarius, a, sgr, a, region, in, which, it, is, embedded, sgr, a, was, discovered, in, 1974, by, bruce, balick, and, robert, l, brown, and, the, asterisk, was, assigned, in, 1982, by, brown, who, understood, that, the, strongest, radio, emission, from, the, center, of, the, galaxy, appeared, to, be, due, to, a, compact, non, thermal, radio, object, the, observations, of, several, stars, orbiting, sagittarius, a, particularly, star, s2, have, been, used, to, determine, the, mass, and, upper, limits, on, the, radius, of, the, object, based, on, mass, and, increasingly, precise, radius, limits, astronomers, have, concluded, that, sagittarius, a, must, be, the, central, supermassive, black, hole, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, the, current, best, estimate, of, its, mass, is, 4, 297, 0, 012, million, solar, masses, reinhard, genzel, and, andrea, ghez, were, awarded, the, 2020, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, their, discovery, that, sagittarius, a, is, a, supermassive, compact, object, for, which, a, black, hole, was, the, only, plausible, explanation, at, the, time, in, may, 2022, astronomers, released, the, first, image, of, the, accretion, disk, around, the, horizon, of, sagittarius, a, confirming, it, to, be, a, black, hole, using, the, event, horizon, telescope, a, world, wide, network, of, radio, observatories, this, is, the, second, confirmed, image, of, a, black, hole, after, messier, 87, s, supermassive, black, hole, in, 2019, the, black, hole, itself, is, not, seen, only, nearby, objects, whose, behavior, is, influenced, by, the, black, hole, the, observed, radio, and, infrared, energy, emanates, from, gas, and, dust, heated, to, millions, of, degrees, while, falling, into, the, black, hole, on, may, 12, 2022, the, first, image, of, sagittarius, a, was, released, by, the, event, horizon, telescope, collaboration, the, image, which, is, based, on, radio, interferometer, data, taken, in, 2017, confirms, that, the, object, contains, a, black, hole, this, is, the, second, image, of, a, black, hole, this, image, took, five, years, of, calculations, to, process, the, data, was, collected, by, eight, radio, observatories, at, six, geographical, sites, radio, images, are, produced, from, data, by, aperture, synthesis, usually, from, night, long, observations, of, stable, sources, the, radio, emission, from, sgr, a, varies, on, the, order, of, minutes, complicating, the, analysis, their, result, gives, an, overall, angular, size, for, the, source, of, 51, 8, 2, 3, as, at, a, distance, of, 26, 000, light, years, 8, 000, parsecs, this, yields, a, diameter, of, 51, 8, million, kilometres, 32, 2, million, miles, for, comparison, earth, is, 150, million, kilometres, 1, 0, astronomical, unit, 93, million, miles, from, the, sun, and, mercury, is, 46, million, km, 0, 31, au, 29, million, mi, from, the, sun, at, perihelion, the, proper, motion, of, sgr, a, is, approximately, 2, 70, mas, per, year, for, the, right, ascension, and, 5, 6, mas, per, year, for, the, declination, the, telescope, s, measurement, of, these, black, holes, tested, einstein, s, theory, of, relativity, more, rigorously, than, has, previously, been, done, and, the, results, match, perfectly, in, 2019, measurements, made, with, the, high, resolution, airborne, wideband, camera, plus, hawc, mounted, in, the, sofia, aircraft, revealed, that, magnetic, fields, cause, the, surrounding, ring, of, gas, and, dust, temperatures, of, which, range, from, 280, to, 17, 500, f, 99, 8, to, 9, 977, 6, k, 173, 3, to, 9, 704, 4, c, to, flow, into, an, orbit, around, sagittarius, a, keeping, black, hole, emissions, low, astronomers, have, been, unable, to, observe, sgr, a, in, the, optical, spectrum, because, of, the, effect, of, 25, magnitudes, of, extinction, absorption, and, scattering, by, dust, and, gas, between, the, source, and, earth, in, april, 1933, karl, jansky, considered, one, of, the, fathers, of, radio, astronomy, discovered, that, a, radio, signal, was, coming, from, a, location, in, the, direction, of, the, constellation, of, sagittarius, towards, the, center, of, the, milky, way, the, radio, source, later, became, known, as, sagittarius, a, his, observations, did, not, extend, quite, as, far, south, as, we, now, know, to, be, the, galactic, center, observations, by, jack, piddington, and, harry, minnett, using, the, csiro, radio, telescope, at, potts, hill, reservoir, in, sydney, discovered, a, discrete, and, bright, sagittarius, scorpius, radio, source, which, after, further, observation, with, the, 80, foot, 24, metre, csiro, radio, telescope, at, dover, heights, was, identified, in, a, letter, to, nature, as, the, probable, galactic, center, later, observations, showed, that, sagittarius, a, actually, consists, of, several, overlapping, sub, components, a, bright, and, very, compact, component, sgr, a, was, discovered, on, february, 13, and, 15, 1974, by, balick, and, robert, l, brown, using, the, baseline, interferometer, of, the, national, radio, astronomy, observatory, the, name, sgr, a, was, coined, by, brown, in, a, 1982, paper, because, the, radio, source, was, exciting, and, excited, states, of, atoms, are, denoted, with, asterisks, since, the, 1980s, it, has, been, evident, that, the, central, component, of, sgr, a, is, likely, a, black, hole, in, 1994, infrared, and, sub, millimetre, spectroscopy, studies, by, a, berkeley, team, involving, nobel, laureate, charles, h, townes, and, future, nobel, prize, winner, reinhard, genzel, showed, that, the, mass, of, sgr, a, was, tightly, concentrated, and, on, the, order, of, 3, million, suns, on, october, 16, 2002, an, international, team, led, by, reinhard, genzel, at, the, max, planck, institute, for, extraterrestrial, physics, reported, the, observation, of, the, motion, of, the, star, s2, near, sagittarius, a, throughout, a, period, of, ten, years, according, to, the, team, s, analysis, the, data, ruled, out, the, possibility, that, sgr, a, contains, a, cluster, of, dark, stellar, objects, or, a, mass, of, degenerate, fermions, strengthening, the, evidence, for, a, massive, black, hole, the, observations, of, s2, used, near, infrared, nir, interferometry, in, the, ks, band, i, e, 2, 1, m, because, of, reduced, interstellar, extinction, in, this, band, sio, masers, were, used, to, align, nir, images, with, radio, observations, as, they, can, be, observed, in, both, nir, and, radio, bands, the, rapid, motion, of, s2, and, other, nearby, stars, easily, stood, out, against, slower, moving, stars, along, the, line, of, sight, so, these, could, be, subtracted, from, the, images, the, vlbi, radio, observations, of, sagittarius, a, could, also, be, aligned, centrally, with, the, nir, images, so, the, focus, of, s2, s, elliptical, orbit, was, found, to, coincide, with, the, position, of, sagittarius, a, from, examining, the, keplerian, orbit, of, s2, they, determined, the, mass, of, sagittarius, a, to, be, 4, 1, 0, 6, million, solar, masses, confined, in, a, volume, with, a, radius, no, more, than, 17, light, hours, 120, au, later, observations, of, the, star, s14, showed, the, mass, of, the, object, to, be, about, 4, 1, million, solar, masses, within, a, volume, with, radius, no, larger, than, 6, 25, light, hours, 45, au, s175, passed, within, a, similar, distance, for, comparison, the, schwarzschild, radius, is, 0, 08, au, 12, million, km, 7, 4, million, mi, they, also, determined, the, distance, from, earth, to, the, galactic, center, the, rotational, center, of, the, milky, way, which, is, important, in, calibrating, astronomical, distance, scales, as, 8, 000, 600, parsecs, 30, 000, 2, 000, light, years, in, november, 2004, a, team, of, astronomers, reported, the, discovery, of, a, potential, intermediate, mass, black, hole, referred, to, as, gcirs, 13e, orbiting, 3, light, years, from, sagittarius, a, this, black, hole, of, 1, 300, solar, masses, is, within, a, cluster, of, seven, stars, this, observation, may, add, support, to, the, idea, that, supermassive, black, holes, grow, by, absorbing, nearby, smaller, black, holes, and, stars, after, monitoring, stellar, orbits, around, sagittarius, a, for, 16, years, gillessen, et, al, estimated, the, object, s, mass, at, 4, 31, 0, 38, million, solar, masses, the, result, was, announced, in, 2008, and, published, in, the, astrophysical, journal, in, 2009, reinhard, genzel, team, leader, of, the, research, said, the, study, has, delivered, what, is, now, considered, to, be, the, best, empirical, evidence, that, supermassive, black, holes, do, really, exist, the, stellar, orbits, in, the, galactic, center, show, that, the, central, mass, concentration, of, four, million, solar, masses, must, be, a, black, hole, beyond, any, reasonable, doubt, on, january, 5, 2015, nasa, reported, observing, an, x, ray, flare, 400, times, brighter, than, usual, a, record, breaker, from, sgr, a, the, unusual, event, may, have, been, caused, by, the, breaking, apart, of, an, asteroid, falling, into, the, black, hole, or, by, the, entanglement, of, magnetic, field, lines, within, gas, flowing, into, sgr, a, according, to, astronomers, on, 13, may, 2019, astronomers, using, the, keck, observatory, witnessed, a, sudden, brightening, of, sgr, a, which, became, 75, times, brighter, than, usual, suggesting, that, the, supermassive, black, hole, may, have, encountered, another, object, in, june, 2023, unexplained, filaments, of, radio, energy, were, found, associated, with, sagittarius, a, in, a, paper, published, on, october, 31, 2018, the, discovery, of, conclusive, evidence, that, sagittarius, a, is, a, black, hole, was, announced, using, the, gravity, interferometer, and, the, four, telescopes, of, the, very, large, telescope, vlt, to, create, a, virtual, telescope, 130, metres, 430, feet, in, diameter, astronomers, detected, clumps, of, gas, moving, at, about, 30, of, the, speed, of, light, emission, from, highly, energetic, electrons, very, close, to, the, black, hole, was, visible, as, three, prominent, bright, flares, these, exactly, match, theoretical, predictions, for, hot, spots, orbiting, close, to, a, black, hole, of, four, million, solar, masses, the, flares, are, thought, to, originate, from, magnetic, interactions, in, the, very, hot, gas, orbiting, very, close, to, sagittarius, a, in, july, 2018, it, was, reported, that, s2, orbiting, sgr, a, had, been, recorded, at, 7, 650, km, s, 17, 1, million, mph, or, 2, 55, the, speed, of, light, leading, up, to, the, pericenter, approach, in, may, 2018, at, about, 120, au, 18, billion, km, 11, billion, mi, approximately, 1, 400, schwarzschild, radii, from, sgr, a, at, that, close, distance, to, the, black, hole, einstein, s, theory, of, general, relativity, gr, predicts, that, s2, would, show, a, discernible, gravitational, redshift, in, addition, to, the, usual, velocity, redshift, the, gravitational, redshift, was, detected, in, agreement, with, the, gr, prediction, within, the, 10, percent, measurement, precision, assuming, that, general, relativity, is, still, a, valid, description, of, gravity, near, the, event, horizon, the, sagittarius, a, radio, emissions, are, not, centered, on, the, black, hole, but, arise, from, a, bright, spot, in, the, region, around, the, black, hole, close, to, the, event, horizon, possibly, in, the, accretion, disc, or, a, relativistic, jet, of, material, ejected, from, the, disc, if, the, apparent, position, of, sagittarius, a, were, exactly, centered, on, the, black, hole, it, would, be, possible, to, see, it, magnified, beyond, its, size, because, of, gravitational, lensing, of, the, black, hole, according, to, general, relativity, this, would, result, in, a, ring, like, structure, which, has, a, diameter, about, 5, 2, times, the, black, hole, s, schwarzschild, radius, 10, as, for, a, black, hole, of, around, 4, million, solar, masses, this, corresponds, to, a, size, of, approximately, 52, as, which, is, consistent, with, the, observed, overall, size, of, about, 50, as, the, size, apparent, diameter, of, the, black, hole, sgr, a, itself, being, 20, as, recent, lower, resolution, observations, revealed, that, the, radio, source, of, sagittarius, a, is, symmetrical, simulations, of, alternative, theories, of, gravity, depict, results, that, may, be, difficult, to, distinguish, from, gr, however, a, 2018, paper, predicts, an, image, of, sagittarius, a, that, is, in, agreement, with, recent, observations, in, particular, it, explains, the, small, angular, size, and, the, symmetrical, morphology, of, the, source, the, mass, of, sagittarius, a, has, been, estimated, in, two, different, ways, the, comparatively, small, mass, of, this, supermassive, black, hole, along, with, the, low, luminosity, of, the, radio, and, infrared, emission, lines, imply, that, the, milky, way, is, not, a, seyfert, galaxy, ultimately, what, is, seen, is, not, the, black, hole, itself, but, observations, that, are, consistent, only, if, there, is, a, black, hole, present, near, sgr, a, in, the, case, of, such, a, black, hole, the, observed, radio, and, infrared, energy, emanates, from, gas, and, dust, heated, to, millions, of, degrees, while, falling, into, the, black, hole, the, black, hole, itself, is, thought, to, emit, only, hawking, radiation, at, a, negligible, temperature, on, the, order, of, 10, 14, kelvin, the, european, space, agency, s, gamma, ray, observatory, integral, observed, gamma, rays, interacting, with, the, nearby, giant, molecular, cloud, sagittarius, b2, causing, x, ray, emission, from, the, cloud, the, total, luminosity, from, this, outburst, l, 1, 5, 10, 39, erg, s, is, estimated, to, be, a, million, times, stronger, than, the, current, output, from, sgr, a, and, is, comparable, with, a, typical, active, galactic, nucleus, in, 2011, this, conclusion, was, supported, by, japanese, astronomers, observing, the, milky, way, s, center, with, the, suzaku, satellite, in, july, 2019, astronomers, reported, finding, a, star, s5, hvs1, traveling, 1, 755, km, s, 3, 93, million, mph, or, 0, 006, c, the, star, is, in, the, grus, or, crane, constellation, in, the, southern, sky, and, about, 29, 000, light, years, from, earth, and, may, have, been, propelled, out, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, after, interacting, with, sagittarius, a, several, values, have, been, given, for, its, spin, parameter, a, c, j, g, m, 2, displaystyle, a, frac, cj, gm, 2, some, examples, are, fragione, loeb, 2020,

as, s, stars, these, stars, are, observed, primarily, in, k, band, infrared, wavelengths, as, interstellar, dust, drastically, limits, visibility, in, visible, wavelengths, this, is, a, rapidly, changing, field, in, 2011, the, orbits, of, the, most, prominent, stars, then, known, were, plotted, in, the, diagram, at, left, showing, a, comparison, between, their, orbits, and, various, orbits, in, the, solar, system, since, then, s62, has, been, found, to, approach, even, more, closely, than, those, stars, the, high, velocities, and, close, approaches, to, the, supermassive, black, hole, makes, these, stars, useful, to, establish, limits, on, the, physical, dimensions, of, sagittarius, a, as, well, as, to, observe, general, relativity, associated, effects, like, periapse, shift, of, their, orbits, an, active, watch, is, maintained, for, the, possibility, of, stars, approaching, the, event, horizon, close, enough, to, be, disrupted, but, none, of, these, stars, are, expected, to, suffer, that, fate, as, of, 2020, s4714, is, the, current, record, holder, of, closest, approach, to, sagittarius, a, at, about, 12, 6, au, 1, 88, billion, km, almost, as, close, as, saturn, gets, to, the, sun, traveling, at, about, 8, of, the, speed, of, light, these, figures, given, are, approximate, the, formal, uncertainties, being, 12, 6, 9, 3, au, and, 23, 928, 8, 840, km, s, its, orbital,

unusual, in, images, of, the, center, of, the, milky, way, in, 2002, the, gas, cloud, g2, which, has, a, mass, about, three, times, that, of, earth, was, confirmed, to, be, likely, on, a, course, taking, it, into, the, accretion, zone, of, sgr, a, in, a, paper, published, in, nature, in, 2012, predictions, of, its, orbit, suggested, it, would, make, its, closest, approach, to, the, black, hole, a, perinigricon, in, early, 2014, when, the, cloud, was, at, a, distance, of, just, over, 3, 000, times, the, radius, of, the, event, horizon, or, 260, au, 36, light, hours, from, the, black, hole, g2, has, been, observed, to, be, disrupting, since, 2009, and, was, predicted, by, some, to, be, completely, destroyed, by, the, encounter, which, could, have, led, to, a, significant, brightening, of, x, ray, and, other, emission, from, the, black, hole, other, astronomers, suggested, the, gas, cloud, could, be, hiding, a, dim, star, or, a, binary, star, merger, product, which, would, hold, it, together, against, the, tidal, forces, of, sgr, a, allowing, the, ensemble, to, pass, by, without, any, effect, in, addition, to, the, tidal, effects, on, the, cloud, itself, it, was, proposed, in, may, 2013, that, prior, to, its, perinigricon, g2, might, experience, multiple, close, encounters, with, members, of, the, black, hole, and, neutron, star, populations, thought, to, orbit, near, the, galactic, center, offering, some, insight, to, the, region, surrounding, the, supermassive, black, hole, at, the, center, of, the, milky, way, the, average, rate, of, accretion, onto, sgr, a, is, unusually, small, for, a, black, hole, of, its, mass, and, is, only, detectable, because, it, is, so, close, to, earth, it, was, thought, that, the, passage, of, g2, in, 2013, might, offer, astronomers, the, chance, to, learn, much, more, about, how, material, accretes, onto, supermassive, black, holes, several, astronomical, facilities, observed, this, closest, approach, with, observations, confirmed, with, chandra, xmm, vla, integral, swift, fermi, and, requested, at, vlt, and, keck, simulations, of, the, passage, were, made, before, it, happened, by, groups, at, eso, and, lawrence, livermore, national, laboratory, llnl, as, the, cloud, approached, the, black, hole, daryl, haggard, said, it, s, exciting, to, have, something, that, feels, more, like, an, experiment, and, hoped, that, the, interaction, would, produce, effects, that, would, provide, new, information, and, insights, nothing, was, observed, during, and, after, the, closest, approach, of, the, cloud, to, the, black, hole, which, was, described, as, a, lack, of, fireworks, and, a, flop, astronomers, from, the, ucla, galactic, center, group, published, observations, obtained, on, march, 19, and, 20, 2014, concluding, that, g2, was, still, intact, in, contrast, to, predictions, for, a, simple, gas, cloud, hypothesis, and, that, the, cloud, was, likely, to, have, a, central, star, an, analysis, published, on, july, 21, 2014, based, on, observations, by, the, eso, s, very, large, telescope, in, chile, concluded, alternatively, that, the, cloud, rather, than, being, isolated, might, be, a, dense, clump, within, a, continuous, but, thinner, stream, of, matter, and, would, act, as, a, constant, breeze, on, the, disk, of, matter, orbiting, the, black, hole, rather, than, sudden, gusts, that, would, have, caused, high, brightness, as, they, hit, as, originally, expected, supporting, this, hypothesis, g1, a, cloud, that, passed, near, the, black, hole, 13, years, ago, had, an, orbit, almost, identical, to, g2, consistent, with, both, clouds, and, a, gas, tail, thought, to, be, trailing, g2, all, being, denser, clumps, within, a, large, single, gas, stream, andrea, ghez, et, al, suggested, in, 2014, that, g2, is, not, a, gas, cloud, but, rather, a, pair, of, binary, stars, that, had, been, orbiting, the, black, hole, in, tandem, and, merged, into, an, extremely, large, star
