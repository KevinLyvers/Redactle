sediment, is, a, naturally, occurring, material, that, is, broken, down, by, processes, of, weathering, and, erosion, and, is, subsequently, transported, by, the, action, of, wind, water, or, ice, or, by, the, force, of, gravity, acting, on, the, particles, for, example, sand, and, silt, can, be, carried, in, suspension, in, river, water, and, on, reaching, the, sea, bed, deposited, by, sedimentation, if, buried, they, may, eventually, become, sandstone, and, siltstone, sedimentary, rocks, through, lithification, sediments, are, most, often, transported, by, water, fluvial, processes, but, also, wind, aeolian, processes, and, glaciers, beach, sands, and, river, channel, deposits, are, examples, of, fluvial, transport, and, deposition, though, sediment, also, often, settles, out, of, slow, moving, or, standing, water, in, lakes, and, oceans, desert, sand, dunes, and, loess, are, examples, of, aeolian, transport, and, deposition, glacial, moraine, deposits, and, till, are, ice, transported, sediments, sediment, can, be, classified, based, on, its, grain, size, grain, shape, and, composition, sediment, size, is, measured, on, a, log, base, 2, scale, called, the, phi, scale, which, classifies, particles, by, size, from, colloid, to, boulder, the, shape, of, particles, can, be, defined, in, terms, of, three, parameters, the, form, is, the, overall, shape, of, the, particle, with, common, descriptions, being, spherical, platy, or, rodlike, the, roundness, is, a, measure, of, how, sharp, grain, corners, are, this, varies, from, well, rounded, grains, with, smooth, corners, and, edges, to, poorly, rounded, grains, with, sharp, corners, and, edges, finally, surface, texture, describes, small, scale, features, such, as, scratches, pits, or, ridges, on, the, surface, of, the, grain, form, also, called, sphericity, is, determined, by, measuring, the, size, of, the, particle, on, its, major, axes, william, c, krumbein, proposed, formulas, for, converting, these, numbers, to, a, single, measure, of, form, such, as, where, d, l, displaystyle, d, l, d, i, displaystyle, d, i, and, d, s, displaystyle, d, s, are, the, long, intermediate, and, short, axis, lengths, of, the, particle, the, form, l, displaystyle, psi, l, varies, from, 1, for, a, perfectly, spherical, particle, to, very, small, values, for, a, platelike, or, rodlike, particle, an, alternate, measure, was, proposed, by, sneed, and, folk, which, again, varies, from, 0, to, 1, with, increasing, sphericity, roundness, describes, how, sharp, the, edges, and, corners, of, particle, are, complex, mathematical, formulas, have, been, devised, for, its, precise, measurement, but, these, are, difficult, to, apply, and, most, geologists, estimate, roundness, from, comparison, charts, common, descriptive, terms, range, from, very, angular, to, angular, to, subangular, to, subrounded, to, rounded, to, very, rounded, with, increasing, degree, of, roundness, surface, texture, describes, the, small, scale, features, of, a, grain, such, as, pits, fractures, ridges, and, scratches, these, are, most, commonly, evaluated, on, quartz, grains, because, these, retain, their, surface, markings, for, long, periods, of, time, surface, texture, varies, from, polished, to, frosted, and, can, reveal, the, history, of, transport, of, the, grain, for, example, frosted, grains, are, particularly, characteristic, of, aeolian, sediments, transported, by, wind, evaluation, of, these, features, often, requires, the, use, of, a, scanning, electron, microscope, composition, of, sediment, can, be, measured, in, terms, of, this, leads, to, an, ambiguity, in, which, clay, can, be, used, as, both, a, size, range, and, a, composition, see, clay, minerals, sediment, is, transported, based, on, the, strength, of, the, flow, that, carries, it, and, its, own, size, volume, density, and, shape, stronger, flows, will, increase, the, lift, and, drag, on, the, particle, causing, it, to, rise, while, larger, or, denser, particles, will, be, more, likely, to, fall, through, the, flow, in, geography, and, geology, fluvial, sediment, processes, or, fluvial, sediment, transport, are, associated, with, rivers, and, streams, and, the, deposits, and, landforms, created, by, sediments, it, can, result, in, the, formation, of, ripples, and, dunes, in, fractal, shaped, patterns, of, erosion, in, complex, patterns, of, natural, river, systems, and, in, the, development, of, floodplains, and, the, occurrence, of, flash, floods, sediment, moved, by, water, can, be, larger, than, sediment, moved, by, air, because, water, has, both, a, higher, density, and, viscosity, in, typical, rivers, the, largest, carried, sediment, is, of, sand, and, gravel, size, but, larger, floods, can, carry, cobbles, and, even, boulders, wind, results, in, the, transportation, of, fine, sediment, and, the, formation, of, sand, dune, fields, and, soils, from, airborne, dust, glaciers, carry, a, wide, range, of, sediment, sizes, and, deposit, it, in, moraines, the, overall, balance, between, sediment, in, transport, and, sediment, being, deposited, on, the, bed, is, given, by, the, exner, equation, this, expression, states, that, the, rate, of, increase, in, bed, elevation, due, to, deposition, is, proportional, to, the, amount, of, sediment, that, falls, out, of, the, flow, this, equation, is, important, in, that, changes, in, the, power, of, the, flow, change, the, ability, of, the, flow, to, carry, sediment, and, this, is, reflected, in, the, patterns, of, erosion, and, deposition, observed, throughout, a, stream, this, can, be, localized, and, simply, due, to, small, obstacles, examples, are, scour, holes, behind, boulders, where, flow, accelerates, and, deposition, on, the, inside, of, meander, bends, erosion, and, deposition, can, also, be, regional, erosion, can, occur, due, to, dam, removal, and, base, level, fall, deposition, can, occur, due, to, dam, emplacement, that, causes, the, river, to, pool, and, deposit, its, entire, load, or, due, to, base, level, rise, seas, oceans, and, lakes, accumulate, sediment, over, time, the, sediment, can, consist, of, terrigenous, material, which, originates, on, land, but, may, be, deposited, in, either, terrestrial, marine, or, lacustrine, lake, environments, or, of, sediments, often, biological, originating, in, the, body, of, water, terrigenous, material, is, often, supplied, by, nearby, rivers, and, streams, or, reworked, marine, sediment, e, g, sand, in, the, mid, ocean, the, exoskeletons, of, dead, organisms, are, primarily, responsible, for, sediment, accumulation, deposited, sediments, are, the, source, of, sedimentary, rocks, which, can, contain, fossils, of, the, inhabitants, of, the, body, of, water, that, were, upon, death, covered, by, accumulating, sediment, lake, bed, sediments, that, have, not, solidified, into, rock, can, be, used, to, determine, past, climatic, conditions, the, major, areas, for, deposition, of, sediments, in, the, marine, environment, include, one, other, depositional, environment, which, is, a, mixture, of, fluvial, and, marine, is, the, turbidite, system, which, is, a, major, source, of, sediment, to, the, deep, sedimentary, and, abyssal, basins, as, well, as, the, deep, oceanic, trenches, any, depression, in, a, marine, environment, where, sediments, accumulate, over, time, is, known, as, a, sediment, trap, the, null, point, theory, explains, how, sediment, deposition, undergoes, a, hydrodynamic, sorting, process, within, the, marine, environment, leading, to, a, seaward, fining, of, sediment, grain, size, one, cause, of, high, sediment, loads, is, slash, and, burn, and, shifting, cultivation, of, tropical, forests, when, the, ground, surface, is, stripped, of, vegetation, and, then, seared, of, all, living, organisms, the, upper, soils, are, vulnerable, to, both, wind, and, water, erosion, in, a, number, of, regions, of, the, earth, entire, sectors, of, a, country, have, become, erodible, for, example, on, the, madagascar, high, central, plateau, which, constitutes, approximately, ten, percent, of, that, country, s, land, area, most, of, the, land, area, is, devegetated, and, gullies, have, eroded, into, the, underlying, soil, to, form, distinctive, gulleys, called, lavakas, these, are, typically, 40, meters, 130, ft, wide, 80, meters, 260, ft, long, and, 15, meters, 49, ft, deep, some, areas, have, as, many, as, 150, lavakas, square, kilometer, and, lavakas, may, account, for, 84, of, all, sediments, carried, off, by, rivers, this, siltation, results, in, discoloration, of, rivers, to, a, dark, red, brown, color, and, leads, to, fish, kills, in, addition, sedimentation, of, river, basins, implies, sediment, management, and, siltation, costs, the, cost, of, removing, an, estimated, 135, million, m, 3, of, accumulated, sediments, due, to, water, erosion, only, is, likely, exceeding, 2, 3, billion, euro, annually, in, the, eu, and, uk, with, large, regional, differences, between, countries, erosion, is, also, an, issue, in, areas, of, modern, farming, where, the, removal, of, native, vegetation, for, the, cultivation, and, harvesting, of, a, single, type, of, crop, has, left, the, soil, unsupported, many, of, these, regions, are, near, rivers, and, drainages, loss, of, soil, due, to, erosion, removes, useful, farmland, adds, to, sediment, loads, and, can, help, transport, anthropogenic, fertilizers, into, the, river, system, which, leads, to, eutrophication, the, sediment, delivery, ratio, sdr, is, fraction, of, gross, erosion, interill, rill, gully, and, stream, erosion, that, is, expected, to, be, delivered, to, the, outlet, of, the, river, the, sediment, transfer, and, deposition, can, be, modelled, with, sediment, distribution, models, such, as, watem, sedem, in, europe, according, to, watem, sedem, model, estimates, the, sediment, delivery, ratio, is, about, 15, watershed, development, near, coral, reefs, is, a, primary, cause, of, sediment, related, coral, stress, the, stripping, of, natural, vegetation, in, the, watershed, for, development, exposes, soil, to, increased, wind, and, rainfall, and, as, a, result, can, cause, exposed, sediment, to, become, more, susceptible, to, erosion, and, delivery, to, the, marine, environment, during, rainfall, events, sediment, can, negatively, affect, corals, in, many, ways, such, as, by, physically, smothering, them, abrading, their, surfaces, causing, corals, to, expend, energy, during, sediment, removal, and, causing, algal, blooms, that, can, ultimately, lead, to, less, space, on, the, seafloor, where, juvenile, corals, polyps, can, settle, when, sediments, are, introduced, into, the, coastal, regions, of, the, ocean, the, proportion, of, land, marine, and, organic, derived, sediment, that, characterizes, the, seafloor, near, sources, of, sediment, output, is, altered, in, addition, because, the, source, of, sediment, i, e, land, ocean, or, organically, is, often, correlated, with, how, coarse, or, fine, sediment, grain, sizes, that, characterize, an, area, are, on, average, grain, size, distribution, of, sediment, will, shift, according, to, relative, input, of, land, typically, fine, marine, typically, coarse, and, organically, derived, variable, with, age, sediment, these, alterations, in, marine, sediment, characterize, the, amount, of, sediment, that, is, suspended, in, the, water, column, at, any, given, time, and, sediment, related, coral, stress, in, july, 2020, marine, biologists, reported, that, aerobic, microorganisms, mainly, in, quasi, suspended, animation, were, found, in, organically, poor, sediments, up, to, 101, 5, million, years, old, 250, feet, below, the, seafloor, in, the, south, pacific, gyre, spg, the, deadest, spot, in, the, ocean, and, could, be, the, longest, living, life, forms, ever, found
