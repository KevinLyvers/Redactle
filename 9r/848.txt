in, geometrical, optics, a, focus, also, called, an, image, point, is, a, point, where, light, rays, originating, from, a, point, on, the, object, converge, although, the, focus, is, conceptually, a, point, physically, the, focus, has, a, spatial, extent, called, the, blur, circle, this, non, ideal, focusing, may, be, caused, by, aberrations, of, the, imaging, optics, in, the, absence, of, significant, aberrations, the, smallest, possible, blur, circle, is, the, airy, disc, which, is, caused, by, diffraction, from, the, optical, system, s, aperture, aberrations, tend, to, worsen, as, the, aperture, diameter, increases, while, the, airy, circle, is, smallest, for, large, apertures, an, image, or, image, point, or, region, is, in, focus, if, light, from, object, points, is, converged, almost, as, much, as, possible, in, the, image, and, out, of, focus, if, light, is, not, well, converged, the, border, between, these, is, sometimes, defined, using, a, circle, of, confusion, criterion, a, principal, focus, or, focal, point, is, a, special, focus, diverging, negative, lenses, and, convex, mirrors, do, not, focus, a, collimated, beam, to, a, point, instead, the, focus, is, the, point, from, which, the, light, appears, to, be, emanating, after, it, travels, through, the, lens, or, reflects, from, the, mirror, a, convex, parabolic, mirror, will, reflect, a, beam, of, collimated, light, to, make, it, appear, as, if, it, were, radiating, from, the, focal, point, or, conversely, reflect, rays, directed, toward, the, focus, as, a, collimated, beam, a, convex, elliptical, mirror, will, reflect, light, directed, towards, one, focus, as, if, it, were, radiating, from, the, other, focus, both, of, which, are, behind, the, mirror, a, convex, hyperbolic, mirror, will, reflect, rays, emanating, from, the, focal, point, in, front, of, the, mirror, as, if, they, were, emanating, from, the, focal, point, behind, the, mirror, conversely, it, can, focus, rays, directed, at, the, focal, point, that, is, behind, the, mirror, towards, the, focal, point, that, is, in, front, of, the, mirror, as, in, a, cassegrain, telescope
