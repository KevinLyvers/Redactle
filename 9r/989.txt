a, scale, or, balance, is, a, device, used, to, measure, weight, or, mass, these, are, also, known, as, mass, scales, weight, scales, mass, balances, massometers, and, weight, balances, the, traditional, scale, consists, of, two, plates, or, bowls, suspended, at, equal, distances, from, a, fulcrum, one, plate, holds, an, object, of, unknown, mass, or, weight, while, objects, of, known, mass, or, weight, called, weights, are, added, to, the, other, plate, until, mechanical, equilibrium, is, achieved, and, the, plates, level, off, which, happens, when, the, masses, on, the, two, plates, are, equal, the, perfect, scale, rests, at, neutral, a, spring, scale, will, make, use, of, a, spring, of, known, stiffness, to, determine, mass, or, weight, suspending, a, certain, mass, will, extend, the, spring, by, a, certain, amount, depending, on, the, spring, s, stiffness, or, spring, constant, the, heavier, the, object, the, more, the, spring, stretches, as, described, in, hooke, s, law, other, types, of, scales, making, use, of, different, physical, principles, also, exist, some, scales, can, be, calibrated, to, read, in, units, of, force, weight, such, as, newtons, instead, of, units, of, mass, such, as, kilograms, scales, and, balances, are, widely, used, in, commerce, as, many, products, are, sold, and, packaged, by, mass, the, balance, scale, is, such, a, simple, device, that, its, usage, likely, far, predates, the, evidence, what, has, allowed, archaeologists, to, link, artifacts, to, weighing, scales, are, the, stones, for, determining, absolute, mass, the, balance, scale, itself, was, probably, used, to, determine, relative, mass, long, before, absolute, mass, the, oldest, attested, evidence, for, the, existence, of, weighing, scales, dates, to, the, fourth, dynasty, of, egypt, with, deben, unit, balance, weights, from, the, reign, of, sneferu, c, 2600, bc, excavated, though, earlier, usage, has, been, proposed, carved, stones, bearing, marks, denoting, mass, and, the, egyptian, hieroglyphic, symbol, for, gold, have, been, discovered, which, suggests, that, egyptian, merchants, had, been, using, an, established, system, of, mass, measurement, to, catalog, gold, shipments, or, gold, mine, yields, although, no, actual, scales, from, this, era, have, survived, many, sets, of, weighing, stones, as, well, as, murals, depicting, the, use, of, balance, scales, suggest, widespread, usage, examples, dating, c, 2400, 1800, bc, have, also, been, found, in, the, indus, river, valley, uniform, polished, stone, cubes, discovered, in, early, settlements, were, probably, used, as, mass, setting, stones, in, balance, scales, although, the, cubes, bear, no, markings, their, masses, are, multiples, of, a, common, denominator, the, cubes, are, made, of, many, different, kinds, of, stones, with, varying, densities, clearly, their, mass, not, their, size, or, other, characteristics, was, a, factor, in, sculpting, these, cubes, in, china, the, earliest, weighing, balance, excavated, was, from, a, tomb, of, the, state, of, chu, of, the, chinese, warring, states, period, dating, back, to, the, 3rd, to, 4th, century, bc, in, mount, zuojiagong, near, changsha, hunan, the, balance, was, made, of, wood, and, used, bronze, masses, variations, on, the, balance, scale, including, devices, like, the, cheap, and, inaccurate, bismar, unequal, armed, scales, began, to, see, common, usage, by, c, 400, bc, by, many, small, merchants, and, their, customers, a, plethora, of, scale, varieties, each, boasting, advantages, and, improvements, over, one, another, appear, throughout, recorded, history, with, such, great, inventors, as, leonardo, da, vinci, lending, a, personal, hand, in, their, development, even, with, all, the, advances, in, weighing, scale, design, and, development, all, scales, until, the, seventeenth, century, ad, were, variations, on, the, balance, scale, the, standardization, of, the, weights, used, and, ensuring, traders, used, the, correct, weights, was, a, considerable, preoccupation, of, governments, throughout, this, time, the, original, form, of, a, balance, consisted, of, a, beam, with, a, fulcrum, at, its, center, for, highest, accuracy, the, fulcrum, would, consist, of, a, sharp, v, shaped, pivot, seated, in, a, shallower, v, shaped, bearing, to, determine, the, mass, of, the, object, a, combination, of, reference, masses, was, hung, on, one, end, of, the, beam, while, the, object, of, unknown, mass, was, hung, on, the, other, end, see, balance, and, steelyard, balance, for, high, precision, work, such, as, empirical, chemistry, the, center, beam, balance, is, still, one, of, the, most, accurate, technologies, available, and, is, commonly, used, for, calibrating, test, masses, however, bronze, fragments, discovered, in, central, germany, and, italy, had, been, used, during, the, bronze, age, as, an, early, form, of, currency, in, the, same, time, period, merchants, had, used, standard, weights, of, equivalent, value, between, 8, and, 10, 5, grams, from, great, britain, to, mesopotamia, the, balance, also, balance, scale, beam, balance, and, laboratory, balance, was, the, first, mass, measuring, instrument, invented, in, its, traditional, form, it, consists, of, a, pivoted, horizontal, lever, with, arms, of, equal, length, the, beam, or, tron, and, a, weighing, pan, suspended, from, each, arm, hence, the, plural, name, scales, for, a, weighing, instrument, the, unknown, mass, is, placed, in, one, pan, and, standard, masses, are, added, to, the, other, pan, until, the, beam, is, as, close, to, equilibrium, as, possible, in, precision, balances, a, more, accurate, determination, of, the, mass, is, given, by, the, position, of, a, sliding, mass, moved, along, a, graduated, scale, a, decimal, balance, uses, the, lever, in, which, the, arm, for, weights, is, 10, times, longer, than, the, arm, for, weighted, objects, so, that, much, lighter, weights, may, be, used, to, weigh, heavy, object, similarly, a, centesimal, balance, uses, arms, in, ratio, 1, 100, unlike, spring, based, scales, balances, are, used, for, the, precision, measurement, of, mass, as, their, accuracy, is, not, affected, by, variations, in, the, local, gravitational, field, on, earth, for, example, these, can, amount, to, 0, 5, between, locations, a, change, in, the, strength, of, the, gravitational, field, caused, by, moving, the, balance, does, not, change, the, measured, mass, because, the, moments, of, force, on, either, side, of, the, center, balanced, beam, are, affected, equally, a, center, beam, balance, will, render, an, accurate, measurement, of, mass, at, any, location, experiencing, a, constant, gravity, or, acceleration, very, precise, measurements, are, achieved, by, ensuring, that, the, balance, s, fulcrum, is, essentially, friction, free, a, knife, edge, is, the, traditional, solution, by, attaching, a, pointer, to, the, beam, which, amplifies, any, deviation, from, a, balance, position, and, finally, by, using, the, lever, principle, which, allows, fractional, masses, to, be, applied, by, movement, of, a, small, mass, along, the, measuring, arm, of, the, beam, as, described, above, for, greatest, accuracy, there, needs, to, be, an, allowance, for, the, buoyancy, in, air, whose, effect, depends, on, the, densities, of, the, masses, involved, to, reduce, the, need, for, large, reference, masses, an, off, center, beam, can, be, used, a, balance, with, an, off, center, beam, can, be, almost, as, accurate, as, a, scale, with, a, center, beam, but, the, off, center, beam, requires, special, reference, masses, and, cannot, be, intrinsically, checked, for, accuracy, by, simply, swapping, the, contents, of, the, pans, as, a, center, beam, balance, can, to, reduce, the, need, for, small, graduated, reference, masses, a, sliding, weight, called, a, poise, can, be, installed, so, that, it, can, be, positioned, along, a, calibrated, scale, a, poise, adds, further, intricacies, to, the, calibration, procedure, since, the, exact, mass, of, the, poise, must, be, adjusted, to, the, exact, lever, ratio, of, the, beam, for, greater, convenience, in, placing, large, and, awkward, loads, a, platform, can, be, floated, on, a, cantilever, beam, system, which, brings, the, proportional, force, to, a, noseiron, bearing, this, pulls, on, a, stilyard, rod, to, transmit, the, reduced, force, to, a, conveniently, sized, beam, one, still, sees, this, design, in, portable, beam, balances, of, 500, kg, capacity, which, are, commonly, used, in, harsh, environments, without, electricity, as, well, as, in, the, lighter, duty, mechanical, bathroom, scale, which, actually, uses, a, spring, scale, internally, the, additional, pivots, and, bearings, all, reduce, the, accuracy, and, complicate, calibration, the, float, system, must, be, corrected, for, corner, errors, before, the, span, is, corrected, by, adjusting, the, balance, beam, and, poise, in, 1669, the, frenchman, gilles, personne, de, roberval, presented, a, new, kind, of, balance, scale, to, the, french, academy, of, sciences, this, scale, consisted, of, a, pair, of, vertical, columns, separated, by, a, pair, of, equal, length, arms, and, pivoting, in, the, center, of, each, arm, from, a, central, vertical, column, creating, a, parallelogram, from, the, side, of, each, vertical, column, a, peg, extended, to, the, amazement, of, observers, no, matter, where, roberval, hung, two, equal, weight, along, the, peg, the, scale, still, balanced, in, this, sense, the, scale, was, revolutionary, it, evolved, into, the, more, commonly, encountered, form, consisting, of, two, pans, placed, on, vertical, column, located, above, the, fulcrum, and, the, parallelogram, below, them, the, advantage, of, the, roberval, design, is, that, no, matter, where, equal, weights, are, placed, in, the, pans, the, scale, will, still, balance, further, developments, have, included, a, gear, balance, in, which, the, parallelogram, is, replaced, by, any, odd, number, of, interlocking, gears, greater, than, one, with, alternating, gears, of, the, same, size, and, with, the, central, gear, fixed, to, a, stand, and, the, outside, gears, fixed, to, pans, as, well, as, the, sprocket, gear, balance, consisting, of, a, bicycle, type, chain, looped, around, an, odd, number, of, sprockets, with, the, central, one, fixed, and, the, outermost, two, free, to, pivot, and, attached, to, a, pan, because, it, has, more, moving, joints, which, add, friction, the, roberval, balance, is, consistently, less, accurate, than, the, traditional, beam, balance, but, for, many, purposes, this, is, compensated, for, by, its, usability, the, torsion, balance, is, one, of, the, most, mechanically, accurate, of, analog, balances, pharmacy, schools, still, teach, how, to, use, torsion, balances, in, the, u, s, it, utilizes, pans, like, a, traditional, balance, that, lie, on, top, of, a, mechanical, chamber, which, bases, measurements, on, the, amount, of, twisting, of, a, wire, or, fiber, inside, the, chamber, the, scale, must, still, use, a, calibration, weight, to, compare, against, and, can, weigh, objects, greater, than, 120, mg, and, come, within, a, margin, of, error, 7, mg, many, microbalances, and, ultra, microbalances, that, weigh, fractional, gram, values, are, torsion, balances, a, common, fiber, type, is, quartz, crystal, a, microbalance, also, called, an, ultramicrobalance, or, nanobalance, is, an, instrument, capable, of, making, precise, measurements, of, the, mass, of, objects, of, relatively, small, mass, on, the, order, of, a, million, parts, of, a, gram, and, below, an, analytical, balance, is, a, class, of, balance, designed, to, measure, small, mass, in, the, sub, milligram, range, the, measuring, pan, of, an, analytical, balance, 0, 1, mg, or, better, is, inside, a, transparent, enclosure, with, doors, so, that, dust, does, not, collect, and, so, any, air, currents, in, the, room, do, not, affect, the, balance, s, operation, this, enclosure, is, often, called, a, draft, shield, the, use, of, a, mechanically, vented, balance, safety, enclosure, which, has, uniquely, designed, acrylic, airfoils, allows, a, smooth, turbulence, free, airflow, that, prevents, balance, fluctuation, and, the, measure, of, mass, down, to, 1, g, without, fluctuations, or, loss, of, product, also, the, sample, must, be, at, room, temperature, to, prevent, natural, convection, from, forming, air, currents, inside, the, enclosure, from, causing, an, error, in, reading, single, pan, mechanical, substitution, balances, maintain, consistent, response, throughout, the, useful, capacity, which, is, achieved, by, maintaining, a, constant, load, on, the, balance, beam, and, thus, the, fulcrum, by, subtracting, mass, on, the, same, side, of, the, beam, to, which, the, sample, is, added, electronic, analytical, scales, measure, the, force, needed, to, counter, the, mass, being, measured, rather, than, using, actual, masses, as, such, they, must, have, calibration, adjustments, made, to, compensate, for, gravitational, differences, they, use, an, electromagnet, to, generate, a, force, to, counter, the, sample, being, measured, and, output, the, result, by, measuring, the, force, needed, to, achieve, balance, such, a, measurement, device, is, called, an, electromagnetic, force, restoration, sensor, pendulum, type, scales, do, not, use, springs, these, designs, use, pendulums, and, operate, as, a, balance, that, is, unaffected, by, differences, in, gravity, an, example, of, application, of, this, design, are, scales, made, by, the, toledo, scale, company, a, programmable, scale, has, a, programmable, logic, controller, in, it, allowing, it, to, be, programmed, for, various, applications, such, as, batching, labeling, filling, with, check, weight, function, truck, scales, and, more, another, important, function, is, counting, e, g, used, to, count, small, parts, in, larger, quantities, during, the, annual, stock, taking, counting, scales, which, can, also, do, just, weighing, can, range, from, mg, to, tonnes, the, scales, specifically, a, two, pan, beam, balance, are, one, of, the, traditional, symbols, of, justice, as, wielded, by, statues, of, lady, justice, this, corresponds, to, the, use, in, a, metaphor, of, matters, being, held, in, the, balance, it, has, its, origins, in, ancient, egypt, scales, also, are, widely, used, as, a, symbol, of, finance, commerce, or, trade, in, which, they, have, played, a, traditional, vital, role, since, ancient, times, for, instance, balance, scales, are, depicted, in, the, seal, of, the, u, s, department, of, the, treasury, and, the, federal, trade, commission, scales, are, also, the, symbol, for, the, astrological, sign, libra, scales, specifically, a, two, pan, beam, balance, in, a, state, of, equal, balance, are, the, traditional, symbol, of, pyrrhonism, indicating, the, equal, balance, of, arguments, used, in, inducing, epoche, although, records, dating, to, the, 1700s, refer, to, spring, scales, for, measuring, mass, the, earliest, design, for, such, a, device, dates, to, 1770, and, credits, richard, salter, an, early, scale, maker, spring, scales, came, into, wide, usage, in, the, united, kingdom, after, 1840, when, r, w, winfield, developed, the, candlestick, scale, for, weighing, letters, and, packages, required, after, the, introduction, of, the, uniform, penny, post, postal, workers, could, work, more, quickly, with, spring, scales, than, balance, scales, because, they, could, be, read, instantaneously, and, did, not, have, to, be, carefully, balanced, with, each, measurement, by, the, 1940s, various, electronic, devices, were, being, attached, to, these, designs, to, make, readings, more, accurate, load, cells, transducers, that, convert, force, to, an, electrical, signal, have, their, beginnings, as, early, as, the, late, nineteenth, century, but, it, was, not, until, the, late, twentieth, century, that, their, widespread, usage, became, economically, and, technologically, viable, a, mechanical, scale, or, balance, is, used, to, describe, a, weighing, device, that, is, used, to, measure, the, mass, force, exertion, tension, and, resistance, of, an, object, without, the, need, of, a, power, supply, types, of, mechanical, scales, include, decimal, balances, spring, scales, hanging, scales, triple, beam, balances, and, force, gauges, a, spring, scale, measures, mass, by, reporting, the, distance, that, a, spring, deflects, under, a, load, this, contrasts, to, a, balance, which, compares, the, torque, on, the, arm, due, to, a, sample, weight, to, the, torque, on, the, arm, due, to, a, standard, reference, mass, using, a, horizontal, lever, spring, scales, measure, force, which, is, the, tension, force, of, constraint, acting, on, an, object, opposing, the, local, force, of, gravity, they, are, usually, calibrated, so, that, measured, force, translates, to, mass, at, earth, s, gravity, the, object, to, be, weighed, can, be, simply, hung, from, the, spring, or, set, on, a, pivot, and, bearing, platform, in, a, spring, scale, the, spring, either, stretches, as, in, a, hanging, scale, in, the, produce, department, of, a, grocery, store, or, compresses, as, in, a, simple, bathroom, scale, by, hooke, s, law, every, spring, has, a, proportionality, constant, that, relates, how, hard, it, is, pulled, to, how, far, it, stretches, weighing, scales, use, a, spring, with, a, known, spring, constant, see, hooke, s, law, and, measure, the, displacement, of, the, spring, by, any, variety, of, mechanisms, to, produce, an, estimate, of, the, gravitational, force, applied, by, the, object, rack, and, pinion, mechanisms, are, often, used, to, convert, the, linear, spring, motion, to, a, dial, reading, spring, scales, have, two, sources, of, error, that, balances, do, not, the, measured, mass, varies, with, the, strength, of, the, local, gravitational, force, by, as, much, as, 0, 5, at, different, locations, on, earth, and, the, elasticity, of, the, measurement, spring, can, vary, slightly, with, temperature, with, proper, manufacturing, and, setup, however, spring, scales, can, be, rated, as, legal, for, commerce, to, remove, the, temperature, error, a, commerce, legal, spring, scale, must, either, have, temperature, compensated, springs, or, be, used, at, a, fairly, constant, temperature, to, eliminate, the, effect, of, gravity, variations, a, commerce, legal, spring, scale, must, be, calibrated, where, it, is, used, it, is, also, common, in, high, capacity, applications, such, as, crane, scales, to, use, hydraulic, force, to, sense, mass, the, test, force, is, applied, to, a, piston, or, diaphragm, and, transmitted, through, hydraulic, lines, to, a, dial, indicator, based, on, a, bourdon, tube, or, electronic, sensor, electronic, digital, scales, display, weight, as, a, number, usually, on, a, liquid, crystal, display, lcd, they, are, versatile, because, they, may, perform, calculations, on, the, measurement, and, transmit, it, to, other, digital, devices, on, a, digital, scale, the, force, of, the, weight, causes, a, spring, to, deform, and, the, amount, of, deformation, is, measured, by, one, or, more, transducers, called, strain, gauges, a, strain, gauge, is, a, conductor, whose, electrical, resistance, changes, when, its, length, changes, strain, gauges, have, limited, capacity, and, larger, digital, scales, may, use, a, hydraulic, transducer, called, a, load, cell, instead, a, voltage, is, applied, to, the, device, and, the, weight, causes, the, current, through, it, to, change, the, current, is, converted, to, a, digital, number, by, an, analog, to, digital, converter, translated, by, digital, logic, to, the, correct, units, and, displayed, on, the, display, usually, the, device, is, run, by, a, microprocessor, chip, a, digital, bathroom, scale, is, a, scale, on, the, floor, which, a, person, stands, on, the, weight, is, shown, on, an, led, or, lcd, display, the, digital, electronics, may, do, more, than, just, display, weight, it, may, calculate, body, fat, bmi, lean, mass, muscle, mass, and, water, ratio, some, modern, bathroom, scales, are, wirelessly, or, cellularly, connected, and, have, features, like, smartphone, integration, cloud, storage, and, fitness, tracking, they, are, usually, powered, by, a, button, cell, or, battery, of, aa, or, aaa, size, digital, kitchen, scales, are, used, for, weighing, food, in, a, kitchen, during, cooking, these, are, usually, lightweight, and, compact, in, electronic, versions, of, spring, scales, the, deflection, of, a, beam, supporting, the, unknown, mass, is, measured, using, a, strain, gauge, which, is, a, length, sensitive, electrical, resistance, the, capacity, of, such, devices, is, only, limited, by, the, resistance, of, the, beam, to, deflection, the, results, from, several, supporting, locations, may, be, added, electronically, so, this, technique, is, suitable, for, determining, the, mass, of, very, heavy, objects, such, as, trucks, and, rail, cars, and, is, used, in, a, modern, weighbridge, these, scales, are, used, in, the, modern, bakery, grocery, delicatessen, seafood, meat, produce, and, other, perishable, goods, departments, supermarket, scales, can, print, labels, and, receipts, mark, mass, and, count, unit, price, total, price, and, in, some, cases, tare, some, modern, supermarket, scales, print, an, rfid, tag, that, can, be, used, to, track, the, item, for, tampering, or, returns, in, most, cases, these, types, of, scales, have, a, sealed, calibration, so, that, the, reading, on, the, display, is, correct, and, cannot, be, tampered, with, in, the, us, the, scales, are, certified, by, the, national, type, evaluation, program, ntep, in, south, africa, by, the, south, african, bureau, of, standards, in, australia, they, are, certified, by, the, national, measurement, institute, nmi, and, in, the, uk, by, the, international, organization, of, legal, metrology, an, industrial, weighing, scale, is, a, device, that, measures, the, weight, or, mass, of, objects, in, various, industries, it, can, range, from, small, bench, scales, to, large, weighbridges, and, it, can, have, different, features, and, capacities, industrial, weighing, scales, are, used, for, quality, control, inventory, management, and, trade, purposes, there, are, many, kinds, of, industrial, weighing, scales, that, are, used, for, different, purposes, and, applications, some, of, the, common, types, are, weighbridges, a, large, scale, that, can, weigh, trucks, lorries, containers, and, other, heavy, duty, vehicles, they, are, used, in, industries, like, manufacturing, shipping, mining, agriculture, etc, container, stacker, scale, a, container, stacker, scale, is, a, specialized, weighing, system, designed, for, accurately, measuring, the, weight, of, shipping, containers,

2014, 32, eu, directives, a, conformity, assessment, procedure, is, carried, out, before, placing, the, instrument, on, the, market, andv, the, instruments, are, verified, after, a, given, period, of, time, in, member, states, of, the, european, union, this, has, tended, to, cause, scale, technology, to, lag, behind, other, technologies, because, expensive, regulatory, hurdles, are, involved, in, introducing, new, designs, nevertheless, there, has, been, a, trend, to, digital, load, cells, which, are, actually, strain, gauge, cells, with, dedicated, analog, converters, and, networking, built, into, the, cell, itself, such, designs, have, reduced, the, service, problems, inherent, with, combining, and, transmitting, a, number, of, 20, millivolt, signals, in, hostile, environments, government, regulation, generally, requires, periodic, inspections, by, licensed, technicians, using, masses, whose, calibration, is, traceable, to, an, approved, laboratory, scales, intended, for, non, trade, use, such, as, those, used, in, bathrooms, doctor, s, offices, kitchens, portion, control, and, price, estimation, but, not, official, price, determination, may, be, produced, but, must, by, law, be, labelled, not, legal, for, trade, to, ensure, that, they, are, not, re, purposed, in, a, way, that, jeopardizes, commercial, interest, in, the, united, states, the, document, describing, how, scales, must, be, designed, installed, and, used, for, commercial, purposes, is, nist, handbook, 44, legal, for, trade, lft, certification, usually, approve, the, readability, by, testing, repeatability, of, measurements, to, ensure, a, maximum, margin, of, error, of, 10, because, gravity, varies, by, over, 0, 5, over, the, surface, of, the, earth, the, distinction, between, force, due, to, gravity, and, mass, is, relevant, for, accurate, calibration, of, scales, for, commercial, purposes, usually, the, goal, is, to, measure, the, mass, of, the, sample, rather, than, its, force, due, to, gravity, at, that, particular, location, traditional, mechanical, balance, beam, scales, intrinsically, measured, mass, but, ordinary, electronic, scales, intrinsically, measure, the, gravitational, force, between, the, sample, and, the, earth, i, e, the, weight, of, the, sample, which, varies, with, location, so, such, a, scale, has, to, be, re, calibrated, after, installation, for, that, specific, location, in, order, to, obtain, an, accurate, indication, of, mass, some, of, the, sources, of, error, in, weighing, are, in, 2014, a, concept, of, hybrid, scale, was, introduced, the, elastically, deformable, arm, scale, which, is, a, combination, between, a, spring, scale, and, a, beam, balance, exploiting, simultaneously, both, principles, of, equilibrium, and, deformation, in, this, scale, the, rigid, arms, of, a, classical, beam, balance, for, example, a, steelyard, are, replaced, with, a, flexible, elastic, rod, in, an, inclined, frictionless, sliding, sleeve, the, rod, can, reach, a, unique, sliding, equilibrium, when, two, vertical, dead, loads, or, masses, are, applied, at, its, edges, equilibrium, which, would, be, impossible, with, rigid, arms, is, guaranteed, because, configurational, forces, develop, at, the, two, edges, of, the, sleeve, as, a, consequence, of, both, the, free, sliding, condition, and, the, nonlinear, kinematics, of, the, elastic, rod, this, mass, measuring, device, can, also, work, without, a, counterweight
