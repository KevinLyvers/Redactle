a, gel, is, a, semi, solid, that, can, have, properties, ranging, from, soft, and, weak, to, hard, and, tough, gels, are, defined, as, a, substantially, dilute, cross, linked, system, which, exhibits, no, flow, when, in, the, steady, state, although, the, liquid, phase, may, still, diffuse, through, this, system, gels, are, mostly, liquid, by, mass, yet, they, behave, like, solids, because, of, a, three, dimensional, cross, linked, network, within, the, liquid, it, is, the, cross, linking, within, the, fluid, that, gives, a, gel, its, structure, hardness, and, contributes, to, the, adhesive, stick, tack, in, this, way, gels, are, a, dispersion, of, molecules, of, a, liquid, within, a, solid, medium, the, word, gel, was, coined, by, 19th, century, scottish, chemist, thomas, graham, by, clipping, from, gelatine, the, process, of, forming, a, gel, is, called, gelation, gels, consist, of, a, solid, three, dimensional, network, that, spans, the, volume, of, a, liquid, medium, and, ensnares, it, through, surface, tension, effects, this, internal, network, structure, may, result, from, physical, bonds, such, as, polymer, chain, entanglements, see, polymers, physical, gels, or, chemical, bonds, such, as, disulfide, bonds, see, thiomers, chemical, gels, as, well, as, crystallites, or, other, junctions, that, remain, intact, within, the, extending, fluid, virtually, any, fluid, can, be, used, as, an, extender, including, water, hydrogels, oil, and, air, aerogel, both, by, weight, and, volume, gels, are, mostly, fluid, in, composition, and, thus, exhibit, densities, similar, to, those, of, their, constituent, liquids, edible, jelly, is, a, common, example, of, a, hydrogel, and, has, approximately, the, density, of, water, polyionic, polymers, are, polymers, with, an, ionic, functional, group, the, ionic, charges, prevent, the, formation, of, tightly, coiled, polymer, chains, this, allows, them, to, contribute, more, to, viscosity, in, their, stretched, state, because, the, stretched, out, polymer, takes, up, more, space, this, is, also, the, reason, gel, hardens, see, polyelectrolyte, for, more, information, a, colloidal, gel, consists, of, a, percolated, network, of, particles, in, a, fluid, medium, providing, mechanical, properties, in, particular, the, emergence, of, elastic, behaviour, the, particles, can, show, attractive, interactions, through, osmotic, depletion, or, through, polymeric, links, colloidal, gels, have, three, phases, in, their, lifespan, gelation, aging, and, collapse, the, gel, is, initially, formed, by, the, assembly, of, particles, into, a, space, spanning, network, leading, to, a, phase, arrest, in, the, aging, phase, the, particles, slowly, rearrange, to, form, thicker, strands, increasing, the, elasticity, of, the, material, gels, can, also, be, collapsed, and, separated, by, external, fields, such, as, gravity, colloidal, gels, show, linear, response, rheology, at, low, amplitudes, these, materials, have, been, explored, as, candidates, for, a, drug, release, matrix, a, hydrogel, is, a, network, of, polymer, chains, that, are, hydrophilic, sometimes, found, as, a, colloidal, gel, in, which, water, is, the, dispersion, medium, a, three, dimensional, solid, results, from, the, hydrophilic, polymer, chains, being, held, together, by, cross, links, because, of, the, inherent, cross, links, the, structural, integrity, of, the, hydrogel, network, does, not, dissolve, from, the, high, concentration, of, water, hydrogels, are, highly, absorbent, they, can, contain, over, 90, water, natural, or, synthetic, polymeric, networks, hydrogels, also, possess, a, degree, of, flexibility, very, similar, to, natural, tissue, due, to, their, significant, water, content, as, responsive, smart, materials, hydrogels, can, encapsulate, chemical, systems, which, upon, stimulation, by, external, factors, such, as, a, change, of, ph, may, cause, specific, compounds, such, as, glucose, to, be, liberated, to, the, environment, in, most, cases, by, a, gel, sol, transition, to, the, liquid, state, chemomechanical, polymers, are, mostly, also, hydrogels, which, upon, stimulation, change, their, volume, and, can, serve, as, actuators, or, sensors, the, first, appearance, of, the, term, hydrogel, in, the, literature, was, in, 1894, an, organogel, is, a, non, crystalline, non, glassy, thermoreversible, thermoplastic, solid, material, composed, of, a, liquid, organic, phase, entrapped, in, a, three, dimensionally, cross, linked, network, the, liquid, can, be, for, example, an, organic, solvent, mineral, oil, or, vegetable, oil, the, solubility, and, particle, dimensions, of, the, structurant, are, important, characteristics, for, the, elastic, properties, and, firmness, of, the, organogel, often, these, systems, are, based, on, self, assembly, of, the, structurant, molecules, an, example, of, formation, of, an, undesired, thermoreversible, network, is, the, occurrence, of, wax, crystallization, in, petroleum, organogels, have, potential, for, use, in, a, number, of, applications, such, as, in, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, art, conservation, and, food, a, xerogel, z, r, o, d, l, is, a, solid, formed, from, a, gel, by, drying, with, unhindered, shrinkage, xerogels, usually, retain, high, porosity, 15, 50, and, enormous, surface, area, 150, 900, m, 2, g, along, with, very, small, pore, size, 1, 10, nm, when, solvent, removal, occurs, under, supercritical, conditions, the, network, does, not, shrink, and, a, highly, porous, low, density, material, known, as, an, aerogel, is, produced, heat, treatment, of, a, xerogel, at, elevated, temperature, produces, viscous, sintering, shrinkage, of, the, xerogel, due, to, a, small, amount, of, viscous, flow, which, results, in, a, denser, and, more, robust, solid, the, density, and, porosity, achieved, depend, on, the, sintering, conditions, nanocomposite, hydrogels, or, hybrid, hydrogels, are, highly, hydrated, polymeric, networks, either, physically, or, covalently, crosslinked, with, each, other, and, or, with, nanoparticles, or, nanostructures, nanocomposite, hydrogels, can, mimic, native, tissue, properties, structure, and, microenvironment, due, to, their, hydrated, and, interconnected, porous, structure, a, wide, range, of, nanoparticles, such, as, carbon, based, polymeric, ceramic, and, metallic, nanomaterials, can, be, incorporated, within, the, hydrogel, structure, to, obtain, nanocomposites, with, tailored, functionality, nanocomposite, hydrogels, can, be, engineered, to, possess, superior, physical, chemical, electrical, thermal, and, biological, properties, many, gels, display, thixotropy, they, become, fluid, when, agitated, but, resolidify, when, resting, in, general, gels, are, apparently, solid, jelly, like, materials, it, is, a, type, of, non, newtonian, fluid, by, replacing, the, liquid, with, gas, it, is, possible, to, prepare, aerogels, materials, with, exceptional, properties, including, very, low, density, high, specific, surface, areas, and, excellent, thermal, insulation, properties, a, gel, is, in, essence, the, mixture, of, a, polymer, network, and, a, solvent, phase, upon, stretching, the, network, crosslinks, are, moved, further, apart, from, each, other, due, to, the, polymer, strands, between, crosslinks, acting, as, entropic, springs, gels, demonstrate, elasticity, like, rubber, which, is, just, a, polymer, network, without, solvent, this, is, so, because, the, free, energy, penalty, to, stretch, an, ideal, polymer, segment, n, displaystyle, n, monomers, of, size, b, displaystyle, b, between, crosslinks, to, an, end, to, end, distance, r, displaystyle, r, is, approximately, given, by, this, is, the, origin, of, both, gel, and, rubber, elasticity, but, one, key, difference, is, that, gel, contains, an, additional, solvent, phase, and, hence, is, capable, of, having, significant, volume, changes, under, deformation, by, taking, in, and, out, solvent, for, example, a, gel, could, swell, to, several, times, its, initial, volume, after, being, immersed, in, a, solvent, after, equilibrium, is, reached, this, is, the, phenomenon, of, gel, swelling, on, the, contrary, if, we, take, the, swollen, gel, out, and, allow, the, solvent, to, evaporate, the, gel, would, shrink, to, roughly, its, original, size, this, gel, volume, change, can, alternatively, be, introduced, by, applying, external, forces, if, a, uniaxial, compressive, stress, is, applied, to, a, gel, some, solvent, contained, in, the, gel, would, be, squeezed, out, and, the, gel, shrinks, in, the, applied, stress, direction, to, study, the, gel, mechanical, state, in, equilibrium, a, good, starting, point, is, to, consider, a, cubic, gel, of, volume, v, 0, displaystyle, v, 0, that, is, stretched, by, factors, 1, displaystyle, lambda, 1, 2, displaystyle, lambda, 2, and, 3, displaystyle, lambda, 3, in, the, three, orthogonal, directions, during, swelling, after, being, immersed, in, a, solvent, phase, of, initial, volume, v, s, 0, displaystyle, v, s0, the, final, deformed, volume, of, gel, is, then, 1, 2, 3, v, 0, displaystyle, lambda, 1, lambda, 2, lambda, 3, v, 0, and, the, total, volume, of, the, system, is, v, 0, v, s, 0, displaystyle, v, 0, v, s0, that, is, assumed, constant, during, the, swelling, process, for, simplicity, of, treatment, the, swollen, state, of, the, gel, is, now, completely, characterized, by, stretch, factors, 1, displaystyle, lambda, 1, 2, displaystyle, lambda, 2, and, 3, displaystyle, lambda, 3, and, hence, it, is, of, interest, to, derive, the, deformation, free, energy, as, a, function, of, them, denoted, as, f, gel, 1, 2, 3, displaystyle, f, text, gel, lambda, 1, lambda, 2, lambda, 3, for, analogy, to, the, historical, treatment, of, rubber, elasticity, and, mixing, free, energy, f, gel, 1, 2, 3, displaystyle, f, text, gel, lambda, 1, lambda, 2, lambda, 3, is, most, often, defined, as, the, free, energy, difference, after, and, before, the, swelling, normalized, by, the, initial, gel, volume, v, 0, displaystyle, v, 0, that, is, a, free, energy, difference, density, the, form, of, f, gel, 1, 2, 3, displaystyle, f, text, gel, lambda, 1, lambda, 2, lambda, 3, naturally, assumes, two, contributions, of, radically, different, physical, origins, one, associated, with, the, elastic, deformation, of, the, polymer, network, and, the, other, with, the, mixing, of, the, network, with, the, solvent, hence, we, write, we, now, consider, the, two, contributions, separately, the, polymer, elastic, deformation, term, is, independent, of, the, solvent, phase, and, has, the, same, expression, as, a, rubber, as, derived, in, the, kuhn, s, theory, of, rubber, elasticity, where, g, 0, displaystyle, g, 0, denotes, the, shear, modulus, of, the, initial, state, on, the, other, hand, the, mixing, term, f, mix, 1, 2, 3, displaystyle, f, text, mix, lambda, 1, lambda, 2, lambda, 3, is, usually, treated, by, the, flory, huggins, free, energy, of, concentrated, polymer, solutions, f, displaystyle, f, phi, where, displaystyle, phi, is, polymer, volume, fraction, suppose, the, initial, gel, has, a, polymer, volume, fraction, of, 0, displaystyle, phi, 0, the, polymer, volume, fraction, after, swelling, would, be, 0, 1, 2, 3, displaystyle, phi, phi, 0, lambda, 1, lambda, 2, lambda, 3, since, the, number, of, monomers, remains, the, same, while, the, gel, volume, has, increased, by, a, factor, of, 1, 2, 3, displaystyle, lambda, 1, lambda, 2, lambda, 3, as, the, polymer, volume, fraction, decreases, from, 0, displaystyle, phi, 0, to, displaystyle, phi, a, polymer, solution, of, concentration, 0, displaystyle, phi, 0, and, volume, v, 0, displaystyle, v, 0, is, mixed, with, a, pure, solvent, of, volume, 1, 2, 3, 1, v, 0, displaystyle, lambda, 1, lambda, 2, lambda, 3, 1, v, 0, to, become, a, solution, with, polymer, concentration, displaystyle, phi, and, volume, 1, 2, 3, v, 0, displaystyle, lambda, 1, lambda, 2, lambda, 3, v, 0, the, free, energy, density, change, in, this, mixing, step, is, given, as, where, on, the, right, hand, side, the, first, term, is, the, flory, huggins, energy, density, of, the, final, swollen, gel, the, second, is, associated, with, the, initial, gel, and, the, third, is, of, the, pure, solvent, prior, to, mixing, substitution, of, 0, 1, 2, 3, displaystyle, phi, phi, 0, lambda, 1, lambda, 2, lambda, 3, leads, to, note, that, the, second, term, is, independent, of, the, stretching, factors, 1, displaystyle, lambda, 1, 2, displaystyle, lambda, 2, and, 3, displaystyle, lambda, 3, and, hence, can, be, dropped, in, subsequent, analysis, now, we, make, use, of, the, flory, huggins, free, energy, for, a, polymer, solvent, solution, that, reads, where, v, c, displaystyle, v, c, is, monomer, volume, n, displaystyle, n, is, polymer, strand, length, and, displaystyle, chi, is, the, flory, huggins, energy, parameter, because, in, a, network, the, polymer, length, is, effectively, infinite, we, can, take, the, limit, n, displaystyle, n, to, infty, and, f, displaystyle, f, phi, reduces, to, substitution, of, this, expression, into, f, mix, 1, 2, 3, displaystyle, f, text, mix, lambda, 1, lambda, 2, lambda, 3, and, addition, of, the, network, contribution, leads, to, this, provides, the, starting, point, to, examining, the, swelling, equilibrium, of, a, gel, network, immersed, in, solvent, it, can, be, shown, that, gel, swelling, is, the, competition, between, two, forces, one, is, the, osmotic, pressure, of, the, polymer, solution, that, favors, the, take, in, of, solvent, and, expansion, the, other, is, the, restoring, force, of, the, polymer, network, elasticity, that, favors, shrinkage, at, equilibrium, the, two, effects, exactly, cancel, each, other, in, principle, and, the, associated, 1, displaystyle, lambda, 1, 2, displaystyle, lambda, 2, and, 3, displaystyle, lambda, 3, define, the, equilibrium, gel, volume, in, solving, the, force, balance, equation, graphical, solutions, are, often, preferred, in, an, alternative, scaling, approach, suppose, an, isotropic, gel, is, stretch, by, a, factor, of, displaystyle, lambda, in, all, three, directions, under, the, affine, network, approximation, the, mean, square, end, to, end, distance, in, the, gel, increases, from, initial, r, 0, 2, displaystyle, r, 0, 2, to, r, 0, 2, displaystyle, lambda, r, 0, 2, and, the, elastic, energy, of, one, stand, can, be, written, as, where, r, ref, displaystyle, r, text, ref, is, the, mean, square, fluctuation, in, end, to, end, distance, of, one, strand, the, modulus, of, the, gel, is, then, this, single, strand, elastic, energy, multiplied, by, strand, number, density, n, b, 3, displaystyle, nu, phi, nb, 3, to, give, this, modulus, can, then, be, equated, to, osmotic, pressure, through, differentiation, of, the, free, energy, to, give, the, same, equation, as, we, found, above, consider, a, hydrogel, made, of, polyelectrolytes, decorated, with, weak, acid, groups, that, can, ionize, according, to, the, reaction, is, immersed, in, a, salt, solution, of, physiological, concentration, the, degree, of, ionization, of, the, polyelectrolytes, is, then, controlled, by, the, ph, displaystyle, text, ph, and, due, to, the, charged, nature, of, h, displaystyle, text, h, and, a, displaystyle, text, a, electrostatic, interactions, with, other, ions, in, the, systems, this, is, effectively, a, reacting, system, governed, by, acid, base, equilibrium, modulated, by, electrostatic, effects, and, is, relevant, in, drug, delivery, sea, water, desalination, and, dialysis, technologies, due, to, the, elastic, nature, of, the, gel, the, dispersion, of, a, displaystyle, text, a, in, the, system, is, constrained, and, hence, there, will, be, a, partitioning, of, salts, ions, and, h, displaystyle, text, h, inside, and, outside, the, gel, which, is, intimately, coupled, to, the, polyelectrolyte, degree, of, ionization, this, ion, partitioning, inside, and, outside, the, gel, is, analogous, to, the, partitioning, of, ions, across, a, semipemerable, membrane, in, classical, donnan, theory, but, a, membrane, is, not, needed, here, because, the, gel, volume, constraint, imposed, by, network, elasticity, effectively, acts, its, role, in, preventing, the, macroions, to, pass, through, the, fictitious, membrane, while, allowing, ions, to, pass, the, coupling, between, the, ion, partitioning, and, polyelectrolyte, ionization, degree, is, only, partially, by, the, classical, donnan, theory, as, a, starting, point, we, can, neglect, the, electrostatic, interactions, among, ions, then, at, equilibrium, some, of, the, weak, acid, sites, in, the, gel, would, dissociate, to, form, a, displaystyle, text, a, that, electrostatically, attracts, positive, charged, h, displaystyle, text, h, and, salt, cations, leading, to, a, relatively, high, concentration, of, h, displaystyle, text, h, and, salt, cations, inside, the, gel, but, because, the, concentration, of, h, displaystyle, text, h, is, locally, higher, it, suppresses, the, further, ionization, of, the, acid, sites, this, phenomenon, is, the, prediction, of, the, classical, donnan, theory, however, with, electrostatic, interactions, there, are, further, complications, to, the, picture, consider, the, case, of, two, adjacent, initially, uncharged, acid, sites, ha, displaystyle, text, ha, are, both, dissociated, to, form, a, displaystyle, text, a, since, the, two, sites, are, both, negatively, charged, there, will, be, a, charge, charge, repulsion, along, the, backbone, of, the, polymer, than, tends, to, stretch, the, chain, this, energy, cost, is, high, both, elastically, and, electrostatically, and, hence, suppress, ionization, even, though, this, ionization, suppression, is, qualitatively, similar, to, that, of, donnan, prediction, it, is, absent, without, electrostatic, consideration, and, present, irrespective, of, ion, partitioning, the, combination, of, both, effects, as, well, as, gel, elasticity, determines, the, volume, of, the, gel, at, equilibrium, due, to, the, complexity, of, the, coupled, acid, base, equilibrium, electrostatics, and, network, elasticity, only, recently, has, such, system, been, correctly, recreated, in, computer, simulations, some, species, secrete, gels, that, are, effective, in, parasite, control, for, example, the, long, finned, pilot, whale, secretes, an, enzymatic, gel, that, rests, on, the, outer, surface, of, this, animal, and, helps, prevent, other, organisms, from, establishing, colonies, on, the, surface, of, these, whales, bodies, hydrogels, existing, naturally, in, the, body, include, mucus, the, vitreous, humor, of, the, eye, cartilage, tendons, and, blood, clots, their, viscoelastic, nature, results, in, the, soft, tissue, component, of, the, body, disparate, from, the, mineral, based, hard, tissue, of, the, skeletal, system, researchers, are, actively, developing, synthetically, derived, tissue, replacement, technologies, derived, from, hydrogels, for, both, temporary, implants, degradable, and, permanent, implants, non, degradable, a, review, article, on, the, subject, discusses, the, use, of, hydrogels, for, nucleus, pulposus, replacement, cartilage, replacement, and, synthetic, tissue, models, many, substances, can, form, gels, when, a, suitable, thickener, or, gelling, agent, is, added, to, their, formula, this, approach, is, common, in, the, manufacture, of, a, wide, range, of, products, from, foods, to, paints, and, adhesives, in, fiber, optic, communications, a, soft, gel, resembling, hair, gel, in, viscosity, is, used, to, fill, the, plastic, tubes, containing, the, fibers, the, main, purpose, of, the, gel, is, to, prevent, water, intrusion, if, the, buffer, tube, is, breached, but, the, gel, also, buffers, the, fibers, against, mechanical, damage, when, the, tube, is, bent, around, corners, during, installation, or, flexed, additionally, the, gel, acts, as, a, processing, aid, when, the, cable, is, being, constructed, keeping, the, fibers, central, whilst, the, tube, material, is, extruded, around, it
