the, virgo, cluster, is, a, large, cluster, of, galaxies, whose, center, is, 53, 8, 0, 3, mly, 16, 5, 0, 1, mpc, away, in, the, constellation, virgo, comprising, approximately, 1, 300, and, possibly, up, to, 2, 000, member, galaxies, the, cluster, forms, the, heart, of, the, larger, virgo, supercluster, of, which, the, local, group, containing, our, milky, way, galaxy, is, a, member, the, local, group, actually, experiences, the, mass, of, the, virgo, supercluster, as, the, virgocentric, flow, it, is, estimated, that, the, virgo, cluster, s, mass, is, 1, 2, 10, 15, m, out, to, 8, degrees, of, the, cluster, s, center, or, a, radius, of, about, 2, 2, mpc, many, of, the, brighter, galaxies, in, this, cluster, including, the, giant, elliptical, galaxy, messier, 87, were, discovered, in, the, late, 1770s, and, early, 1780s, and, subsequently, included, in, charles, messier, s, catalogue, of, non, cometary, fuzzy, objects, described, by, messier, as, nebulae, without, stars, their, true, nature, was, not, recognized, until, the, 1920s, the, cluster, subtends, a, maximum, arc, of, approximately, 8, degrees, centered, in, the, constellation, virgo, although, some, of, the, cluster, s, most, prominent, members, can, be, seen, with, smaller, instruments, a, 6, inch, telescope, will, reveal, about, 160, of, the, cluster, s, galaxies, on, a, clear, night, its, brightest, member, is, the, elliptical, galaxy, messier, 49, however, its, most, famous, member, is, the, elliptical, galaxy, messier, 87, which, is, located, in, the, center, of, the, cluster, the, cluster, is, a, fairly, heterogeneous, mixture, of, spiral, and, elliptical, galaxies, as, of, 2004, it, is, believed, that, the, spiral, galaxies, of, the, cluster, are, distributed, in, an, oblong, prolate, filament, approximately, four, times, as, long, as, it, is, wide, stretching, along, the, line, of, sight, from, the, milky, way, the, elliptical, galaxies, are, more, centrally, concentrated, than, the, spiral, galaxies, the, cluster, is, an, aggregate, of, at, least, three, separate, subclumps, virgo, a, centered, on, m87, a, second, centered, on, the, galaxy, m86, and, virgo, b, centered, on, m49, with, some, authors, including, a, virgo, c, subcluster, centered, on, the, galaxy, m60, as, well, as, a, lvc, low, velocity, cloud, subclump, centered, on, the, large, spiral, galaxy, ngc, 4216, notably, the, giant, elliptical, galaxy, m87, contains, a, supermassive, black, hole, whose, event, horizon, was, observed, by, the, event, horizon, telescope, collaboration, in, 2019, of, all, of, the, subclumps, virgo, a, formed, by, a, mixture, of, elliptical, lenticular, and, usually, gas, poor, spiral, galaxies, is, the, dominant, one, with, a, mass, of, approximately, 10, 14, m, which, is, approximately, an, order, of, magnitude, larger, than, the, other, two, subclumps, the, three, subgroups, are, in, the, process, of, merging, to, form, a, larger, single, cluster, and, are, surrounded, by, other, smaller, galaxy, clouds, mostly, composed, of, spiral, galaxies, known, as, n, cloud, s, cloud, and, virgo, e, that, are, in, the, process, of, infalling, to, merge, with, them, plus, other, farther, isolated, galaxies, and, galaxy, groups, like, the, galaxy, cloud, coma, i, that, are, also, attracted, by, the, gravity, of, virgo, to, merge, with, it, in, the, future, this, strongly, suggests, the, virgo, cluster, is, a, dynamically, young, cluster, that, is, still, forming, other, two, nearby, aggregations, known, as, m, cloud, w, cloud, and, w, cloud, seem, to, be, background, systems, independent, of, the, main, cluster, the, large, mass, of, the, cluster, is, indicated, by, the, high, peculiar, velocities, of, many, of, its, galaxies, sometimes, as, high, as, 1, 600, km, s, with, respect, to, the, cluster, s, center, the, virgo, cluster, lies, within, the, virgo, supercluster, and, its, gravitational, effect, slows, down, the, nearby, galaxies, the, large, mass, of, the, cluster, has, the, effect, of, slowing, down, the, recession, of, the, local, group, from, the, cluster, by, approximately, ten, percent, molecular, gasses, in, virgo, cluster, has, been, swept, away, by, a, huge, cosmic, broom, that, is, preventing, nearby, galaxies, from, birthing, new, stars, the, actual, cause, of, it, has, been, a, long, standing, mystery, in, astrophysics, according, to, scientists, it, occurs, because, of, the, extreme, environment, of, the, virgo, cluster, as, with, many, other, rich, galaxy, clusters, virgo, s, intracluster, medium, is, filled, with, a, hot, rarefied, plasma, at, temperatures, of, 30, million, kelvins, that, emits, x, rays, within, the, intracluster, medium, icm, are, found, a, large, number, of, intergalactic, stars, up, to, 10, of, the, stars, in, the, cluster, including, some, planetary, nebulae, it, is, theorized, that, these, were, expelled, from, their, home, galaxies, by, interactions, with, other, galaxies, the, icm, also, contains, some, globular, clusters, possibly, stripped, off, dwarf, galaxies, and, even, at, least, one, star, formation, region, below, is, a, table, of, bright, or, notable, objects, in, the, cluster, and, their, subunit, subcluster, note, that, in, some, cases, a, galaxy, may, be, considered, in, a, different, subunit, by, other, researchers, sources, fainter, galaxies, within, the, cluster, are, usually, known, by, their, numbers, in, the, virgo, cluster, catalog, particularly, members, of, the, numerous, dwarf, galaxy, population
