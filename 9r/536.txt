foams, are, two, phase, material, systems, where, a, gas, is, disbursed, in, a, second, non, gaseous, material, specifically, in, which, gas, cells, are, enclosed, by, a, distinct, liquid, or, solid, material, 6, 4, the, foam, may, contain, more, or, less, liquid, according, to, circumstances, 6, although, in, the, case, of, gas, liquid, foams, the, gas, occupies, most, of, the, volume, 4, the, word, derives, from, the, medieval, german, and, otherwise, obsolete, veim, in, reference, to, the, frothy, head, forming, in, the, glass, once, the, beer, has, been, freshly, poured, cf, ausgefeimt, 1, theories, regarding, foam, formation, structure, and, properties, in, physics, and, physical, chemistry, differ, somewhat, between, liquid, and, solid, foams, in, that, the, former, are, dynamic, e, g, in, their, being, continuously, deformed, as, a, result, of, gas, diffusing, between, cells, liquid, draining, from, the, foam, into, a, bulk, liquid, etc, 1, 2, theories, regarding, liquid, foams, have, as, direct, analogs, theories, regarding, emulsions, 3, two, phase, material, systems, in, which, one, liquid, is, enclosed, by, another, in, most, foams, the, volume, of, gas, is, large, with, thin, films, of, liquid, or, solid, separating, the, regions, of, gas, a, bath, sponge, and, the, head, on, a, glass, of, beer, are, examples, of, foams, soap, foams, are, also, known, as, suds, solid, foams, can, be, closed, cell, or, open, cell, in, closed, cell, foam, the, gas, forms, discrete, pockets, each, completely, surrounded, by, the, solid, material, in, open, cell, foam, gas, pockets, connect, to, each, other, a, bath, sponge, is, an, example, of, an, open, cell, foam, water, easily, flows, through, the, entire, structure, displacing, the, air, a, sleeping, mat, is, an, example, of, a, product, composed, of, closed, cell, foam, foams, are, examples, of, dispersed, media, in, general, gas, is, present, so, it, divides, into, gas, bubbles, of, different, sizes, i, e, the, material, is, polydisperse, separated, by, liquid, regions, that, may, form, films, thinner, and, thinner, when, the, liquid, phase, drains, out, of, the, system, films, when, the, principal, scale, is, small, i, e, for, a, very, fine, foam, this, dispersed, medium, can, be, considered, a, type, of, colloid, foam, can, also, refer, to, something, that, is, analogous, to, foam, such, as, quantum, foam, a, foam, is, in, many, cases, a, multi, scale, system, one, scale, is, the, bubble, material, foams, are, typically, disordered, and, have, a, variety, of, bubble, sizes, at, larger, sizes, the, study, of, idealized, foams, is, closely, linked, to, the, mathematical, problems, of, minimal, surfaces, and, three, dimensional, tessellations, also, called, honeycombs, the, weaire, phelan, structure, is, reported, in, one, primary, philosophical, source, to, be, the, best, possible, optimal, unit, cell, of, a, perfectly, ordered, foam, while, plateau, s, laws, describe, how, soap, films, form, structures, in, foams, at, lower, scale, than, the, bubble, is, the, thickness, of, the, film, for, metastable, foams, which, can, be, considered, a, network, of, interconnected, films, called, lamellae, ideally, the, lamellae, connect, in, triads, and, radiate, 120, outward, from, the, connection, points, known, as, plateau, borders, an, even, lower, scale, is, the, liquid, air, interface, at, the, surface, of, the, film, most, of, the, time, this, interface, is, stabilized, by, a, layer, of, amphiphilic, structure, often, made, of, surfactants, particles, pickering, emulsion, or, more, complex, associations, several, conditions, are, needed, to, produce, foam, there, must, be, mechanical, work, surface, active, components, surfactants, that, reduce, the, surface, tension, and, the, formation, of, foam, faster, than, its, breakdown, to, create, foam, work, w, is, needed, to, increase, the, surface, area, a, where, is, the, surface, tension, one, of, the, ways, foam, is, created, is, through, dispersion, where, a, large, amount, of, gas, is, mixed, with, a, liquid, a, more, specific, method, of, dispersion, involves, injecting, a, gas, through, a, hole, in, a, solid, into, a, liquid, if, this, process, is, completed, very, slowly, then, one, bubble, can, be, emitted, from, the, orifice, at, a, time, as, shown, in, the, picture, below, one, of, the, theories, for, determining, the, separation, time, is, shown, below, however, while, this, theory, produces, theoretical, data, that, matches, the, experimental, data, detachment, due, to, capillarity, is, accepted, as, a, better, explanation, the, buoyancy, force, acts, to, raise, the, bubble, which, is, where, v, displaystyle, v, is, the, volume, of, the, bubble, g, displaystyle, g, is, the, acceleration, due, to, gravity, and, 1, is, the, density, of, the, gas, 2, is, the, density, of, the, liquid, the, force, working, against, the, buoyancy, force, is, the, surface, tension, force, which, is, where, is, the, surface, tension, and, r, displaystyle, r, is, the, radius, of, the, orifice, as, more, air, is, pushed, into, the, bubble, the, buoyancy, force, grows, quicker, than, the, surface, tension, force, thus, detachment, occurs, when, the, buoyancy, force, is, large, enough, to, overcome, the, surface, tension, force, in, addition, if, the, bubble, is, treated, as, a, sphere, with, a, radius, of, r, displaystyle, r, and, the, volume, v, displaystyle, v, is, substituted, in, to, the, equation, above, separation, occurs, at, the, moment, when, examining, this, phenomenon, from, a, capillarity, viewpoint, for, a, bubble, that, is, being, formed, very, slowly, it, can, be, assumed, that, the, pressure, p, displaystyle, p, inside, is, constant, everywhere, the, hydrostatic, pressure, in, the, liquid, is, designated, by, p, 0, displaystyle, p, 0, the, change, in, pressure, across, the, interface, from, gas, to, liquid, is, equal, to, the, capillary, pressure, hence, where, r, 1, and, r, 2, are, the, radii, of, curvature, and, are, set, as, positive, at, the, stem, of, the, bubble, r, 3, and, r, 4, are, the, radii, of, curvature, also, treated, as, positive, here, the, hydrostatic, pressure, in, the, liquid, has, to, take, in, account, z, the, distance, from, the, top, to, the, stem, of, the, bubble, the, new, hydrostatic, pressure, at, the, stem, of, the, bubble, is, p, 0, 1, 2, z, the, hydrostatic, pressure, balances, the, capillary, pressure, which, is, shown, below, finally, the, difference, in, the, top, and, bottom, pressure, equal, the, change, in, hydrostatic, pressure, at, the, stem, of, the, bubble, the, shape, of, the, bubble, is, nearly, cylindrical, consequently, either, r, 3, or, r, 4, is, large, while, the, other, radius, of, curvature, is, small, as, the, stem, of, the, bubble, grows, in, length, it, becomes, more, unstable, as, one, of, the, radius, grows, and, the, other, shrinks, at, a, certain, point, the, vertical, length, of, the, stem, exceeds, the, circumference, of, the, stem, and, due, to, the, buoyancy, forces, the, bubble, separates, and, the, process, repeats, the, stabilization, of, a, foam, is, caused, by, van, der, waals, forces, between, the, molecules, in, the, foam, electrical, double, layers, created, by, dipolar, surfactants, and, the, marangoni, effect, which, acts, as, a, restoring, force, to, the, lamellae, the, marangoni, effect, depends, on, the, liquid, that, is, foaming, being, impure, generally, surfactants, in, the, solution, decrease, the, surface, tension, the, surfactants, also, clump, together, on, the, surface, and, form, a, layer, as, shown, below, for, the, marangoni, effect, to, occur, the, foam, must, be, indented, as, shown, in, the, first, picture, this, indentation, increases, local, surface, area, surfactants, have, a, larger, diffusion, time, than, the, bulk, of, the, solution, so, the, surfactants, are, less, concentrated, in, the, indentation, also, surface, stretching, makes, the, surface, tension, of, the, indented, spot, greater, than, the, surrounding, area, consequentially, since, diffusion, time, for, the, surfactants, is, large, the, marangoni, effect, has, time, to, take, place, the, difference, in, surface, tension, creates, a, gradient, which, instigates, fluid, flow, from, areas, of, lower, surface, tension, to, areas, of, higher, surface, tension, the, second, picture, shows, the, film, at, equilibrium, after, the, marangoni, effect, has, taken, place, curing, a, foam, solidifies, it, making, it, indefinitely, stable, at, stp, witold, rybczynski, and, jacques, hadamard, developed, an, equation, to, calculate, the, velocity, of, bubbles, that, rise, in, foam, with, the, assumption, that, the, bubbles, are, spherical, with, a, radius, r, displaystyle, r, with, velocity, in, units, of, centimeters, per, second, 1, and, 2, is, the, density, for, a, gas, and, liquid, respectively, in, units, of, g, cm, 3, and, 1, and, 2, is, the, dynamic, viscosity, of, the, gas, and, liquid, respectively, in, units, of, g, cm, s, and, g, is, the, acceleration, of, gravity, in, units, of, cm, s, 2, however, since, the, density, and, viscosity, of, a, liquid, is, much, greater, than, the, gas, the, density, and, viscosity, of, the, gas, can, be, neglected, which, yields, the, new, equation, for, velocity, of, bubbles, rising, as, however, through, experiments, it, has, been, shown, that, a, more, accurate, model, for, bubbles, rising, is, deviations, are, due, to, the, marangoni, effect, and, capillary, pressure, which, affect, the, assumption, that, the, bubbles, are, spherical, for, laplace, pressure, of, a, curved, gas, liquid, interface, the, two, principal, radii, of, curvature, at, a, point, are, r, 1, and, r, 2, with, a, curved, interface, the, pressure, in, one, phase, is, greater, than, the, pressure, in, another, phase, the, capillary, pressure, p, c, is, given, by, the, equation, of, where, displaystyle, gamma, is, the, surface, tension, the, bubble, shown, below, is, a, gas, phase, 1, in, a, liquid, phase, 2, and, point, a, designates, the, top, of, the, bubble, while, point, b, designates, the, bottom, of, the, bubble, at, the, top, of, the, bubble, at, point, a, the, pressure, in, the, liquid, is, assumed, to, be, p, 0, as, well, as, in, the, gas, at, the, bottom, of, the, bubble, at, point, b, the, hydrostatic, pressure, is, where, 1, and, 2, is, the, density, for, a, gas, and, liquid, respectively, the, difference, in, hydrostatic, pressure, at, the, top, of, the, bubble, is, 0, while, the, difference, in, hydrostatic, pressure, at, the, bottom, of, the, bubble, across, the, interface, is, gz, 2, 1, assuming, that, the, radii, of, curvature, at, point, a, are, equal, and, denoted, by, r, a, and, that, the, radii, of, curvature, at, point, b, are, equal, and, denoted, by, r, b, then, the, difference, in, capillary, pressure, between, point, a, and, point, b, is, at, equilibrium, the, difference, in, capillary, pressure, must, be, balanced, by, the, difference, in, hydrostatic, pressure, hence, since, the, density, of, the, gas, is, less, than, the, density, of, the, liquid, the, left, hand, side, of, the, equation, is, always, positive, therefore, the, inverse, of, r, a, must, be, larger, than, the, r, b, meaning, that, from, the, top, of, the, bubble, to, the, bottom, of, the, bubble, the, radius, of, curvature, increases, therefore, without, neglecting, gravity, the, bubbles, cannot, be, spherical, in, addition, as, z, increases, this, causes, the, difference, in, r, a, and, r, b, too, which, means, the, bubble, deviates, more, from, its, shape, the, larger, it, grows, foam, destabilization, occurs, for, several, reasons, first, gravitation, causes, drainage, of, liquid, to, the, foam, base, which, rybczynski, and, hadamar, include, in, their, theory, however, foam, also, destabilizes, due, to, osmotic, pressure, causes, drainage, from, the, lamellas, to, the, plateau, borders, due, to, internal, concentration, differences, in, the, foam, and, laplace, pressure, causes, diffusion, of, gas, from, small, to, large, bubbles, due, to, pressure, difference, in, addition, films, can, break, under, disjoining, pressure, these, effects, can, lead, to, rearrangement, of, the, foam, structure, at, scales, larger, than, the, bubbles, which, may, be, individual, t1, process, or, collective, even, of, the, avalanche, type, solid, foams, both, open, cell, and, closed, cell, are, considered, as, a, sub, class, of, cellular, structures, they, often, have, lower, nodal, connectivity, as, compared, to, other, cellular, structures, like, honeycombs, and, truss, lattices, and, thus, their, failure, mechanism, is, dominated, by, bending, of, members, low, nodal, connectivity, and, the, resulting, failure, mechanism, ultimately, lead, to, their, lower, mechanical, strength, and, stiffness, compared, to, honeycombs, and, truss, lattices, the, strength, of, foams, can, be, impacted, by, the, density, the, material, used, and, the, arrangement, of, the, cellular, structure, open, vs, closed, and, pore, isotropy, to, characterize, the, mechanical, properties, of, foams, compressive, stress, strain, curves, are, used, to, measure, their, strength, and, ability, to, absorb, energy, since, this, is, an, important, factor, in, foam, based, technologies, for, elastomeric, cellular, solids, as, the, foam, is, compressed, first, it, behaves, elastically, as, the, cell, walls, bend, then, as, the, cell, walls, buckle, there, is, yielding, and, breakdown, of, the, material, until, finally, the, cell, walls, crush, together, and, the, material, ruptures, this, is, seen, in, a, stress, strain, curve, as, a, steep, linear, elastic, regime, a, linear, regime, with, a, shallow, slope, after, yielding, plateau, stress, and, an, exponentially, increasing, regime, the, stiffness, of, the, material, can, be, calculated, from, the, linear, elastic, regime, where, the, modulus, for, open, celled, foams, can, be, defined, by, the, equation, e, e, s, f, c, f, s, 2, displaystyle, left, frac, e, e, s, right, f, c, f, left, frac, rho, rho, s, right, 2, where, e, s, displaystyle, e, s, is, the, modulus, of, the, solid, component, e, displaystyle, e, is, the, modulus, of, the, honeycomb, structure, c, f, displaystyle, c, f, is, a, constant, having, a, value, close, to, one, displaystyle, rho, is, the, density, of, the, honeycomb, structure, and, s, displaystyle, rho, s, is, the, density, of, the, solid, the, elastic, modulus, for, closed, cell, foams, can, be, described, similarly, by, e, e, s, f, c, f, s, 3, displaystyle, left, frac, e, e, s, right, f, c, f, left, frac, rho, rho, s, right, 3, where, the, only, difference, is, the, exponent, in, the, density, dependence, however, in, real, materials, a, closed, cell, foam, has, more, material, at, the, cell, edges, which, makes, it, more, closely, follow, the, equation, for, open, cell, foams, the, ratio, of, the, density, of, the, honeycomb, structure, compared, with, the, solid, structure, has, a, large, impact, on, the, modulus, of, the, material, overall, foam, strength, increases, with, density, of, the, cell, and, stiffness, of, the, matrix, material, another, important, property, which, can, be, deduced, from, the, stress, strain, curve, is, the, energy, that, the, foam, is, able, to, absorb, the, area, under, the, curve, specified, to, be, before, rapid, densification, at, the, peak, stress, represents, the, energy, in, the, foam, in, units, of, energy, per, unit, volume, the, maximum, energy, stored, by, the, foam, prior, to, rupture, is, described, by, the, equation, w, m, a, x, e, s, 0, 05, s, 2, 0, 975, 1, 4, s, displaystyle, frac, w, max, e, s, 0, 05, left, frac, rho, rho, s, right, 2, left, this, equation, is, derived, from, assuming, an, idealized, foam, with, engineering, approximations, from, experimental, results, most, energy, absorption, occurs, at, the, plateau, stress, region, after, the, steep, linear, elastic, regime, the, isotropy, of, the, cellular, structure, and, the, absorption, of, fluids, can, also, have, an, impact, on, the, mechanical, properties, of, a, foam, if, there, is, anisotropy, present, then, the, materials, response, to, stress, will, be, directionally, dependent, and, thus, the, stress, strain, curve, modulus, and, energy, absorption, will, vary, depending, on, the, direction, of, applied, force, also, open, cell, structures, which, have, connected, pores, can, allow, water, or, other, liquids, to, flow, through, the, structure, which, can, also, affect, the, rigidity, and, energy, absorption, capabilities, the, acoustical, property, of, the, speed, of, sound, through, a, foam, is, of, interest, when, analyzing, failures, of, hydraulic, components, the, analysis, involves, calculating, total, hydraulic, cycles, to, fatigue, failure, the, speed, of, sound, in, a, foam, is, determined, by, the, mechanical, properties, of, the, gas, creating, the, foam, oxygen, nitrogen, or, combinations, assuming, that, the, speed, of, sound, is, based, on, the, liquid, s, fluid, properties, leads, to, errors, in, calculating, fatigue, cycles, and, failure, of, mechanical, hydraulic, components, using, acoustical, transducers, and, related, instrumentation, that, set, low, limits, 0, 50, 000, hz, with, roll, off, causes, errors, the, low, roll, off, during, measurement, of, actual, frequency, of, acoustic, cycles, results, in, miscalculation, due, to, actual, hydraulic, cycles, in, the, possible, ranges, of, 1, 1000, mhz, or, higher, instrumentation, systems, are, most, revealing, when, cycle, bandwidths, exceed, the, actual, measured, cycles, by, a, factor, of, 10, to, 100, associated, instrumentation, costs, also, increase, by, factors, of, 10, to, 100, most, moving, hydro, mechanical, components, cycle, at, 0, 50, hz, but, entrained, gas, bubbles, resulting, in, a, foamy, condition, of, the, associated, hydraulic, fluid, results, in, actual, hydraulic, cycles, that, can, exceed, 1000, mhz, even, if, the, moving, mechanical, components, do, not, cycle, at, the, higher, cycle, frequency, being, a, multi, scale, system, involving, many, phenomena, and, a, versatile, medium, foam, can, be, studied, using, many, different, techniques, considering, the, different, scales, experimental, techniques, are, diffraction, ones, mainly, light, scattering, techniques, dws, see, below, static, and, dynamic, light, scattering, x, rays, and, neutron, scattering, at, sub, micrometer, scales, or, microscopic, ones, considering, the, system, as, continuous, its, bulk, properties, can, be, characterized, by, light, transmittance, but, also, conductimetry, the, correlation, between, structure, and, bulk, is, evidenced, more, accurately, by, acoustics, in, particular, the, organisation, between, bubbles, has, been, studied, numerically, using, sequential, attempts, of, evolution, of, the, minimum, surface, energy, either, at, random, pott, s, model, or, deterministic, way, surface, evolver, the, evolution, with, time, i, e, the, dynamics, can, be, simulated, using, these, models, or, the, bubble, model, durian, which, considers, the, motion, of, individual, bubbles, observations, of, the, small, scale, structure, can, be, made, by, shining, the, foam, with, laser, light, or, x, ray, beams, and, measuring, the, reflectivity, of, the, films, between, bubbles, observations, of, the, global, structure, can, be, done, using, neutron, scattering, a, typical, light, scattering, or, diffusion, optical, technique, multiple, light, scattering, coupled, with, vertical, scanning, is, the, most, widely, used, technique, to, monitor, the, dispersion, state, of, a, product, hence, identifying, and, quantifying, destabilization, phenomena, it, works, on, any, concentrated, dispersions, without, dilution, including, foams, when, light, is, sent, through, the, sample, it, is, backscattered, by, the, bubbles, the, backscattering, intensity, is, directly, proportional, to, the, size, and, volume, fraction, of, the, dispersed, phase, therefore, local, changes, in, concentration, drainage, syneresis, and, global, changes, in, size, ripening, coalescence, are, detected, and, monitored, liquid, foams, can, be, used, in, fire, retardant, foam, such, as, those, that, are, used, in, extinguishing, fires, especially, oil, fires, the, dough, of, leavened, bread, has, traditionally, been, understood, as, a, closed, cell, foam, yeast, causing, bread, to, rise, via, tiny, bubbles, of, gas, that, become, the, bread, pores, where, the, cells, do, not, connect, with, each, other, cutting, the, dough, releases, the, gas, in, the, bubbles, that, are, cut, but, the, gas, in, the, rest, of, the, dough, cannot, escape, when, dough, is, allowed, to, rise, too, far, it, becomes, an, open, cell, foam, in, which, the, gas, pockets, are, connected, cutting, the, dough, surface, at, that, point, would, cause, a, large, volume, of, gas, to, escape, and, the, dough, to, collapse, recent, research, has, indicated, that, the, pore, structure, in, bread, is, 99, interconnected, into, one, large, vacuole, thus, the, closed, cell, foam, of, the, moist, dough, is, transformed, into, an, open, cell, solid, foam, in, the, bread, the, unique, property, of, gas, liquid, foams, having, very, high, specific, surface, area, is, exploited, in, the, chemical, processes, of, froth, flotation, and, foam, fractionation, foam, depopulation, or, foaming, is, a, means, of, mass, killing, farm, animals, by, spraying, foam, over, a, large, area, to, obstruct, breathing, and, ultimately, cause, suffocation, it, is, usually, used, to, attempt, to, stop, disease, spread, solid, foams, are, a, class, of, lightweight, cellular, engineering, materials, these, foams, are, typically, classified, into, two, types, based, on, their, pore, structure, open, cell, structured, foams, also, known, as, reticulated, foams, and, closed, cell, foams, at, high, enough, cell, resolutions, any, type, can, be, treated, as, continuous, or, continuum, materials, and, are, referred, to, as, cellular, solids, with, predictable, mechanical, properties, open, cell, foams, can, be, used, to, filter, air, for, example, a, foam, embedded, with, catalyst, has, been, shown, to, catalytically, convert, formaldehyde, to, benign, substances, when, formaldehyde, polluted, air, passes, through, the, open, cell, structure, open, cell, structured, foams, contain, pores, that, are, connected, to, each, other, and, form, an, interconnected, network, that, is, relatively, soft, open, cell, foams, fill, with, whatever, gas, surrounds, them, if, filled, with, air, a, relatively, good, insulator, results, but, if, the, open, cells, fill, with, water, insulation, properties, would, be, reduced, recent, studies, have, put, the, focus, on, studying, the, properties, of, open, cell, foams, as, an, insulator, material, wheat, gluten, teos, bio, foams, have, been, produced, showing, similar, insulator, properties, as, for, those, foams, obtained, from, oil, based, resources, foam, rubber, is, a, type, of, open, cell, foam, closed, cell, foams, do, not, have, interconnected, pores, the, closed, cell, foams, normally, have, higher, compressive, strength, due, to, their, structures, however, closed, cell, foams, are, also, in, general, more, dense, require, more, material, and, as, a, consequence, are, more, expensive, to, produce, the, closed, cells, can, be, filled, with, a, specialized, gas, to, provide, improved, insulation, the, closed, cell, structure, foams, have, higher, dimensional, stability, low, moisture, absorption, coefficients, and, higher, strength, compared, to, open, cell, structured, foams, all, types, of, foam, are, widely, used, as, core, material, in, sandwich, structured, composite, materials, the, earliest, known, engineering, use, of, cellular, solids, is, with, wood, which, in, its, dry, form, is, a, closed, cell, foam, composed, of, lignin, cellulose, and, air, from, the, early, 20th, century, various, types, of, specially, manufactured, solid, foams, came, into, use, the, low, density, of, these, foams, makes, them, excellent, as, thermal, insulators, and, flotation, devices, and, their, lightness, and, compressibility, make, them, ideal, as, packing, materials, and, stuffings, an, example, of, the, use, of, azodicarbonamide, as, a, blowing, agent, is, found, in, the, manufacture, of, vinyl, pvc, and, eva, pe, foams, where, it, plays, a, role, in, the, formation, of, air, bubbles, by, breaking, down, into, gas, at, high, temperature, the, random, or, stochastic, geometry, of, these, foams, makes, them, good, for, energy, absorption, as, well, in, the, late, 20th, century, to, early, 21st, century, new, manufacturing, techniques, have, allowed, for, geometry, that, results, in, excellent, strength, and, stiffness, per, weight, these, new, materials, are, typically, referred, to, as, engineered, cellular, solids, a, special, class, of, closed, cell, foams, known, as, syntactic, foam, contains, hollow, particles, embedded, in, a, matrix, material, the, spheres, can, be, made, from, several, materials, including, glass, ceramic, and, polymers, the, advantage, of, syntactic, foams, is, that, they, have, a, very, high, strength, to, weight, ratio, making, them, ideal, materials, for, many, applications, including, deep, sea, and, space, applications, one, particular, syntactic, foam, employs, shape, memory, polymer, as, its, matrix, enabling, the, foam, to, take, on, the, characteristics, of, shape, memory, resins, and, composite, materials, i, e, it, has, the, ability, to, be, reshaped, repeatedly, when, heated, above, a, certain, temperature, and, cooled, shape, memory, foams, have, many, possible, applications, such, as, dynamic, structural, support, flexible, foam, core, and, expandable, foam, fill, integral, skin, foam, also, known, as, self, skin, foam, is, a, type, of, foam, with, a, high, density, skin, and, a, low, density, core, it, can, be, formed, in, an, open, mold, process, or, a, closed, mold, process, in, the, open, mold, process, two, reactive, components, are, mixed, and, poured, into, an, open, mold, the, mold, is, then, closed, and, the, mixture, is, allowed, to, expand, and, cure, examples, of, items, produced, using, this, process, include, arm, rests, baby, seats, shoe, soles, and, mattresses, the, closed, mold, process, more, commonly, known, as, reaction, injection, molding, rim, injects, the, mixed, components, into, a, closed, mold, under, high, pressures, foam, in, this, case, meaning, bubbly, liquid, is, also, produced, as, an, often, unwanted, by, product, in, the, manufacture, of, various, substances, for, example, foam, is, a, serious, problem, in, the, chemical, industry, especially, for, biochemical, processes, many, biological, substances, for, example, proteins, easily, create, foam, on, agitation, or, aeration, foam, is, a, problem, because, it, alters, the, liquid, flow, and, blocks, oxygen, transfer, from, air, thereby, preventing, microbial, respiration, in, aerobic, fermentation, processes, for, this, reason, anti, foaming, agents, like, silicone, oils, are, added, to, prevent, these, problems, chemical, methods, of, foam, control, are, not, always, desired, with, respect, to, the, problems, i, e, contamination, reduction, of, mass, transfer, they, may, cause, especially, in, food, and, pharmaceutical, industries, where, the, product, quality, is, of, great, importance, mechanical, methods, to, prevent, foam, formation, are, more, common, than, chemical, ones
