luminosity, is, an, absolute, measure, of, radiated, electromagnetic, energy, light, per, unit, time, and, is, synonymous, with, the, radiant, power, emitted, by, a, light, emitting, object, in, astronomy, luminosity, is, the, total, amount, of, electromagnetic, energy, emitted, per, unit, of, time, by, a, star, galaxy, or, other, astronomical, objects, in, si, units, luminosity, is, measured, in, joules, per, second, or, watts, in, astronomy, values, for, luminosity, are, often, given, in, the, terms, of, the, luminosity, of, the, sun, l, luminosity, can, also, be, given, in, terms, of, the, astronomical, magnitude, system, the, absolute, bolometric, magnitude, m, bol, of, an, object, is, a, logarithmic, measure, of, its, total, energy, emission, rate, while, absolute, magnitude, is, a, logarithmic, measure, of, the, luminosity, within, some, specific, wavelength, range, or, filter, band, in, contrast, the, term, brightness, in, astronomy, is, generally, used, to, refer, to, an, object, s, apparent, brightness, that, is, how, bright, an, object, appears, to, an, observer, apparent, brightness, depends, on, both, the, luminosity, of, the, object, and, the, distance, between, the, object, and, observer, and, also, on, any, absorption, of, light, along, the, path, from, object, to, observer, apparent, magnitude, is, a, logarithmic, measure, of, apparent, brightness, the, distance, determined, by, luminosity, measures, can, be, somewhat, ambiguous, and, is, thus, sometimes, called, the, luminosity, distance, when, not, qualified, the, term, luminosity, means, bolometric, luminosity, which, is, measured, either, in, the, si, units, watts, or, in, terms, of, solar, luminosities, l, a, bolometer, is, the, instrument, used, to, measure, radiant, energy, over, a, wide, band, by, absorption, and, measurement, of, heating, a, star, also, radiates, neutrinos, which, carry, off, some, energy, about, 2, in, the, case, of, the, sun, contributing, to, the, star, s, total, luminosity, the, iau, has, defined, a, nominal, solar, luminosity, of, 3, 828, 10, 26, w, to, promote, publication, of, consistent, and, comparable, values, in, units, of, the, solar, luminosity, while, bolometers, do, exist, they, cannot, be, used, to, measure, even, the, apparent, brightness, of, a, star, because, they, are, insufficiently, sensitive, across, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, and, because, most, wavelengths, do, not, reach, the, surface, of, the, earth, in, practice, bolometric, magnitudes, are, measured, by, taking, measurements, at, certain, wavelengths, and, constructing, a, model, of, the, total, spectrum, that, is, most, likely, to, match, those, measurements, in, some, cases, the, process, of, estimation, is, extreme, with, luminosities, being, calculated, when, less, than, 1, of, the, energy, output, is, observed, for, example, with, a, hot, wolf, rayet, star, observed, only, in, the, infrared, bolometric, luminosities, can, also, be, calculated, using, a, bolometric, correction, to, a, luminosity, in, a, particular, passband, the, term, luminosity, is, also, used, in, relation, to, particular, passbands, such, as, a, visual, luminosity, of, k, band, luminosity, these, are, not, generally, luminosities, in, the, strict, sense, of, an, absolute, measure, of, radiated, power, but, absolute, magnitudes, defined, for, a, given, filter, in, a, photometric, system, several, different, photometric, systems, exist, some, such, as, the, ubv, or, johnson, system, are, defined, against, photometric, standard, stars, while, others, such, as, the, ab, system, are, defined, in, terms, of, a, spectral, flux, density, a, star, s, luminosity, can, be, determined, from, two, stellar, characteristics, size, and, effective, temperature, the, former, is, typically, represented, in, terms, of, solar, radii, r, while, the, latter, is, represented, in, kelvins, but, in, most, cases, neither, can, be, measured, directly, to, determine, a, star, s, radius, two, other, metrics, are, needed, the, star, s, angular, diameter, and, its, distance, from, earth, both, can, be, measured, with, great, accuracy, in, certain, cases, with, cool, supergiants, often, having, large, angular, diameters, and, some, cool, evolved, stars, having, masers, in, their, atmospheres, that, can, be, used, to, measure, the, parallax, using, vlbi, however, for, most, stars, the, angular, diameter, or, parallax, or, both, are, far, below, our, ability, to, measure, with, any, certainty, since, the, effective, temperature, is, merely, a, number, that, represents, the, temperature, of, a, black, body, that, would, reproduce, the, luminosity, it, obviously, cannot, be, measured, directly, but, it, can, be, estimated, from, the, spectrum, an, alternative, way, to, measure, stellar, luminosity, is, to, measure, the, star, s, apparent, brightness, and, distance, a, third, component, needed, to, derive, the, luminosity, is, the, degree, of, interstellar, extinction, that, is, present, a, condition, that, usually, arises, because, of, gas, and, dust, present, in, the, interstellar, medium, ism, the, earth, s, atmosphere, and, circumstellar, matter, consequently, one, of, astronomy, s, central, challenges, in, determining, a, star, s, luminosity, is, to, derive, accurate, measurements, for, each, of, these, components, without, which, an, accurate, luminosity, figure, remains, elusive, extinction, can, only, be, measured, directly, if, the, actual, and, observed, luminosities, are, both, known, but, it, can, be, estimated, from, the, observed, colour, of, a, star, using, models, of, the, expected, level, of, reddening, from, the, interstellar, medium, in, the, current, system, of, stellar, classification, stars, are, grouped, according, to, temperature, with, the, massive, very, young, and, energetic, class, o, stars, boasting, temperatures, in, excess, of, 30, 000, k, while, the, less, massive, typically, older, class, m, stars, exhibit, temperatures, less, than, 3, 500, k, because, luminosity, is, proportional, to, temperature, to, the, fourth, power, the, large, variation, in, stellar, temperatures, produces, an, even, vaster, variation, in, stellar, luminosity, because, the, luminosity, depends, on, a, high, power, of, the, stellar, mass, high, mass, luminous, stars, have, much, shorter, lifetimes, the, most, luminous, stars, are, always, young, stars, no, more, than, a, few, million, years, for, the, most, extreme, in, the, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, the, x, axis, represents, temperature, or, spectral, type, while, the, y, axis, represents, luminosity, or, magnitude, the, vast, majority, of, stars, are, found, along, the, main, sequence, with, blue, class, o, stars, found, at, the, top, left, of, the, chart, while, red, class, m, stars, fall, to, the, bottom, right, certain, stars, like, deneb, and, betelgeuse, are, found, above, and, to, the, right, of, the, main, sequence, more, luminous, or, cooler, than, their, equivalents, on, the, main, sequence, increased, luminosity, at, the, same, temperature, or, alternatively, cooler, temperature, at, the, same, luminosity, indicates, that, these, stars, are, larger, than, those, on, the, main, sequence, and, they, are, called, giants, or, supergiants, blue, and, white, supergiants, are, high, luminosity, stars, somewhat, cooler, than, the, most, luminous, main, sequence, stars, a, star, like, deneb, for, example, has, a, luminosity, around, 200, 000, l, a, spectral, type, of, a2, and, an, effective, temperature, around, 8, 500, k, meaning, it, has, a, radius, around, 203, r, 1, 41, 10, 11, m, for, comparison, the, red, supergiant, betelgeuse, has, a, luminosity, around, 100, 000, l, a, spectral, type, of, m2, and, a, temperature, around, 3, 500, k, meaning, its, radius, is, about, 1, 000, r, 7, 0, 10, 11, m, red, supergiants, are, the, largest, type, of, star, but, the, most, luminous, are, much, smaller, and, hotter, with, temperatures, up, to, 50, 000, k, and, more, and, luminosities, of, several, million, l, meaning, their, radii, are, just, a, few, tens, of, r, for, example, r136a1, has, a, temperature, over, 46, 000, k, and, a, luminosity, of, more, than, 6, 100, 000, l, mostly, in, the, uv, it, is, only, 39, r, 2, 7, 10, 10, m, the, luminosity, of, a, radio, source, is, measured, in, w, hz, 1, to, avoid, having, to, specify, a, bandwidth, over, which, it, is, measured, the, observed, strength, or, flux, density, of, a, radio, source, is, measured, in, jansky, where, 1, jy, 10, 26, w, m, 2, hz, 1, for, example, consider, a, 10, w, transmitter, at, a, distance, of, 1, million, metres, radiating, over, a, bandwidth, of, 1, mhz, by, the, time, that, power, has, reached, the, observer, the, power, is, spread, over, the, surface, of, a, sphere, with, area, 4, r, 2, or, about, 1, 26, 10, 13, m, 2, so, its, flux, density, is, 10, 10, 6, 1, 26, 10, 13, w, m, 2, hz, 1, 8, 10, 7, jy, more, generally, for, sources, at, cosmological, distances, a, k, correction, must, be, made, for, the, spectral, index, of, the, source, and, a, relativistic, correction, must, be, made, for, the, fact, that, the, frequency, scale, in, the, emitted, rest, frame, is, different, from, that, in, the, observer, s, rest, frame, so, the, full, expression, for, radio, luminosity, assuming, isotropic, emission, is, l, s, o, b, s, 4, d, l, 2, 1, z, 1, displaystyle, l, nu, frac, s, mathrm, obs, 4, pi, d, l, 2, 1, z, 1, alpha, where, l, is, the, luminosity, in, w, hz, 1, s, obs, is, the, observed, flux, density, in, w, m, 2, hz, 1, d, l, is, the, luminosity, distance, in, metres, z, is, the, redshift, is, the, spectral, index, in, the, sense, i, displaystyle, i, propto, nu, alpha, and, in, radio, astronomy, assuming, thermal, emission, the, spectral, index, is, typically, equal, to, 2, for, example, consider, a, 1, jy, signal, from, a, radio, source, at, a, redshift, of, 1, at, a, frequency, of, 1, 4, ghz, ned, wright, s, cosmology, calculator, calculates, a, luminosity, distance, for, a, redshift, of, 1, to, be, 6701, mpc, 2, 10, 26, m, giving, a, radio, luminosity, of, 10, 26, 4, 2, 10, 26, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 10, 26, w, hz, 1, to, calculate, the, total, radio, power, this, luminosity, must, be, integrated, over, the, bandwidth, of, the, emission, a, common, assumption, is, to, set, the, bandwidth, to, the, observing, frequency, which, effectively, assumes, the, power, radiated, has, uniform, intensity, from, zero, frequency, up, to, the, observing, frequency, in, the, case, above, the, total, power, is, 4, 10, 27, 1, 4, 10, 9, 5, 7, 10, 36, w, this, is, sometimes, expressed, in, terms, of, the, total, i, e, integrated, over, all, wavelengths, luminosity, of, the, sun, which, is, 3, 86, 10, 26, w, giving, a, radio, power, of, 1, 5, 10, 10, l, the, stefan, boltzmann, equation, applied, to, a, black, body, gives, the, value, for, luminosity, for, a, black, body, an, idealized, object, which, is, perfectly, opaque, and, non, reflecting, l, a, t, 4, displaystyle, l, sigma, at, 4, where, a, is, the, surface, area, t, is, the, temperature, in, kelvins, and, is, the, stefan, boltzmann, constant, with, a, value, of, 5, 670, 374, 419, 10, 8, w, m, 2, k, 4, imagine, a, point, source, of, light, of, luminosity, l, displaystyle, l, that, radiates, equally, in, all, directions, a, hollow, sphere, centered, on, the, point, would, have, its, entire, interior, surface, illuminated, as, the, radius, increases, the, surface, area, will, also, increase, and, the, constant, luminosity, has, more, surface, area, to, illuminate, leading, to, a, decrease, in, observed, brightness, f, l, a, displaystyle, f, frac, l, a, where, the, surface, area, of, a, sphere, with, radius, r, is, a, 4, r, 2, displaystyle, a, 4, pi, r, 2, so, for, stars, and, other, point, sources, of, light, f, l, 4, r, 2, displaystyle, f, frac, l, 4, pi, r, 2, where, r, displaystyle, r, is, the, distance, from, the, observer, to, the, light, source, for, stars, on, the, main, sequence, luminosity, is, also, related, to, mass, approximately, as, below, l, l, m, m, 3, 5, displaystyle, frac, l, l, odot, approx, left, frac, m, m, odot, right, 3, 5, luminosity, is, an, intrinsic, measurable, property, of, a, star, independent, of, distance, the, concept, of, magnitude, on, the, other, hand, incorporates, distance, the, apparent, magnitude, is, a, measure, of, the, diminishing, flux, of, light, as, a, result, of, distance, according, to, the, inverse, square, law, the, pogson, logarithmic, scale, is, used, to, measure, both, apparent, and, absolute, magnitudes, the, latter, corresponding, to, the, brightness, of, a, star, or, other, celestial, body, as, seen, if, it, would, be, located, at, an, interstellar, distance, of, 10, parsecs, 3, 1, 10, 17, metres, in, addition, to, this, brightness, decrease, from, increased, distance, there, is, an, extra, decrease, of, brightness, due, to, extinction, from, intervening, interstellar, dust, by, measuring, the, width, of, certain, absorption, lines, in, the, stellar, spectrum, it, is, often, possible, to, assign, a, certain, luminosity, class, to, a, star, without, knowing, its, distance, thus, a, fair, measure, of, its, absolute, magnitude, can, be, determined, without, knowing, its, distance, nor, the, interstellar, extinction, in, measuring, star, brightnesses, absolute, magnitude, apparent, magnitude, and, distance, are, interrelated, parameters, if, two, are, known, the, third, can, be, determined, since, the, sun, s, luminosity, is, the, standard, comparing, these, parameters, with, the, sun, s, apparent, magnitude, and, distance, is, the, easiest, way, to, remember, how, to, convert, between, them, although, officially, zero, point, values, are, defined, by, the, iau, the, magnitude, of, a, star, a, unitless, measure, is, a, logarithmic, scale, of, observed, visible, brightness, the, apparent, magnitude, is, the, observed, visible, brightness, from, earth, which, depends, on, the, distance, of, the, object, the, absolute, magnitude, is, the, apparent, magnitude, at, a, distance, of, 10, pc, 3, 1, 10, 17, m, therefore, the, bolometric, absolute, magnitude, is, a, logarithmic, measure, of, the, bolometric, luminosity, the, difference, in, bolometric, magnitude, between, two, objects, is, related, to, their, luminosity, ratio, according, to, m, bol1, m, bol2, 2, 5, log, 10, l, 1, l, 2, displaystyle, m, text, bol1, m, text, bol2, 2, 5,

magnitude, can, be, calculated, from, a, luminosity, in, watts, m, b, o, l, 2, 5, log, 10, l, l, 0, 2, 5, log, 10, l, 71, 1974, displaystyle, m, mathrm, bol, 2, 5, log, 10, frac, l, l, 0, approx, 2,
