a, semiconductor, is, a, material, that, has, an, electrical, conductivity, value, falling, between, that, of, a, conductor, such, as, copper, and, an, insulator, such, as, glass, its, resistivity, generally, falls, as, its, temperature, rises, metals, behave, in, the, opposite, way, in, many, cases, their, conducting, properties, may, be, altered, in, useful, ways, by, introducing, impurities, doping, into, the, crystal, structure, when, two, differently, doped, regions, exist, in, the, same, crystal, a, semiconductor, junction, is, created, the, behavior, of, charge, carriers, which, include, electrons, ions, and, electron, holes, at, these, junctions, is, the, basis, of, diodes, transistors, and, most, modern, electronics, some, examples, of, semiconductors, are, silicon, germanium, gallium, arsenide, and, elements, near, the, so, called, metalloid, staircase, on, the, periodic, table, after, silicon, gallium, arsenide, is, the, second, most, common, semiconductor, and, is, used, in, laser, diodes, solar, cells, microwave, frequency, integrated, circuits, and, others, silicon, is, a, critical, element, for, fabricating, most, electronic, circuits, semiconductor, devices, can, display, a, range, of, different, useful, properties, such, as, passing, current, more, easily, in, one, direction, than, the, other, showing, variable, resistance, and, having, sensitivity, to, light, or, heat, because, the, electrical, properties, of, a, semiconductor, material, can, be, modified, by, doping, and, by, the, application, of, electrical, fields, or, light, devices, made, from, semiconductors, can, be, used, for, amplification, switching, and, energy, conversion, the, term, semiconductor, is, also, used, to, describe, materials, used, in, high, capacity, medium, to, high, voltage, cables, as, part, of, their, insulation, and, these, materials, are, often, plastic, xlpe, cross, linked, polyethylene, with, carbon, black, the, conductivity, of, silicon, is, increased, by, adding, a, small, amount, of, the, order, of, 1, in, 10, 8, of, pentavalent, antimony, phosphorus, or, arsenic, or, trivalent, boron, gallium, indium, atoms, this, process, is, known, as, doping, and, the, resulting, semiconductors, are, known, as, doped, or, extrinsic, semiconductors, apart, from, doping, the, conductivity, of, a, semiconductor, can, be, improved, by, increasing, its, temperature, this, is, contrary, to, the, behavior, of, a, metal, in, which, conductivity, decreases, with, an, increase, in, temperature, the, modern, understanding, of, the, properties, of, a, semiconductor, relies, on, quantum, physics, to, explain, the, movement, of, charge, carriers, in, a, crystal, lattice, doping, greatly, increases, the, number, of, charge, carriers, within, the, crystal, when, a, semiconductor, is, doped, by, group, v, elements, they, will, behave, like, donors, creating, free, electrons, known, as, n, type, doping, when, a, semiconductor, is, doped, by, group, iii, elements, they, will, behave, like, acceptors, creating, free, holes, known, as, p, type, doping, the, semiconductor, materials, used, in, electronic, devices, are, doped, under, precise, conditions, to, control, the, concentration, and, regions, of, p, and, n, type, dopants, a, single, semiconductor, device, crystal, can, have, many, p, and, n, type, regions, the, p, n, junctions, between, these, regions, are, responsible, for, the, useful, electronic, behavior, using, a, hot, point, probe, one, can, determine, quickly, whether, a, semiconductor, sample, is, p, or, n, type, a, few, of, the, properties, of, semiconductor, materials, were, observed, throughout, the, mid, 19th, and, first, decades, of, the, 20th, century, the, first, practical, application, of, semiconductors, in, electronics, was, the, 1904, development, of, the, cat, s, whisker, detector, a, primitive, semiconductor, diode, used, in, early, radio, receivers, developments, in, quantum, physics, led, in, turn, to, the, invention, of, the, transistor, in, 1947, and, the, integrated, circuit, in, 1958, semiconductors, in, their, natural, state, are, poor, conductors, because, a, current, requires, the, flow, of, electrons, and, semiconductors, have, their, valence, bands, filled, preventing, the, entire, flow, of, new, electrons, several, developed, techniques, allow, semiconducting, materials, to, behave, like, conducting, materials, such, as, doping, or, gating, these, modifications, have, two, outcomes, n, type, and, p, type, these, refer, to, the, excess, or, shortage, of, electrons, respectively, a, balanced, number, of, electrons, would, cause, a, current, to, flow, throughout, the, material, heterojunctions, occur, when, two, differently, doped, semiconducting, materials, are, joined, for, example, a, configuration, could, consist, of, p, doped, and, n, doped, germanium, this, results, in, an, exchange, of, electrons, and, holes, between, the, differently, doped, semiconducting, materials, the, n, doped, germanium, would, have, an, excess, of, electrons, and, the, p, doped, germanium, would, have, an, excess, of, holes, the, transfer, occurs, until, an, equilibrium, is, reached, by, a, process, called, recombination, which, causes, the, migrating, electrons, from, the, n, type, to, come, in, contact, with, the, migrating, holes, from, the, p, type, the, result, of, this, process, is, a, narrow, strip, of, immobile, ions, which, causes, an, electric, field, across, the, junction, a, difference, in, electric, potential, on, a, semiconducting, material, would, cause, it, to, leave, thermal, equilibrium, and, create, a, non, equilibrium, situation, this, introduces, electrons, and, holes, to, the, system, which, interact, via, a, process, called, ambipolar, diffusion, whenever, thermal, equilibrium, is, disturbed, in, a, semiconducting, material, the, number, of, holes, and, electrons, changes, such, disruptions, can, occur, as, a, result, of, a, temperature, difference, or, photons, which, can, enter, the, system, and, create, electrons, and, holes, the, processes, that, create, or, annihilate, electrons, and, holes, are, called, generation, and, recombination, respectively, in, certain, semiconductors, excited, electrons, can, relax, by, emitting, light, instead, of, producing, heat, controlling, the, semiconductor, composition, and, electrical, current, allows, for, the, manipulation, of, the, emitted, light, s, properties, these, semiconductors, are, used, in, the, construction, of, light, emitting, diodes, and, fluorescent, quantum, dots, semiconductors, with, high, thermal, conductivity, can, be, used, for, heat, dissipation, and, improving, thermal, management, of, electronics, they, play, a, crucial, role, in, electric, vehicles, high, brightness, leds, and, power, modules, among, other, applications, semiconductors, have, large, thermoelectric, power, factors, making, them, useful, in, thermoelectric, generators, as, well, as, high, thermoelectric, figures, of, merit, making, them, useful, in, thermoelectric, coolers, a, large, number, of, elements, and, compounds, have, semiconducting, properties, including, the, most, common, semiconducting, materials, are, crystalline, solids, but, amorphous, and, liquid, semiconductors, are, also, known, these, include, hydrogenated, amorphous, silicon, and, mixtures, of, arsenic, selenium, and, tellurium, in, a, variety, of, proportions, these, compounds, share, with, better, known, semiconductors, the, properties, of, intermediate, conductivity, and, a, rapid, variation, of, conductivity, with, temperature, as, well, as, occasional, negative, resistance, such, disordered, materials, lack, the, rigid, crystalline, structure, of, conventional, semiconductors, such, as, silicon, they, are, generally, used, in, thin, film, structures, which, do, not, require, material, of, higher, electronic, quality, being, relatively, insensitive, to, impurities, and, radiation, damage, almost, all, of, today, s, electronic, technology, involves, the, use, of, semiconductors, with, the, most, important, aspect, being, the, integrated, circuit, ic, which, are, found, in, desktops, laptops, scanners, cell, phones, and, other, electronic, devices, semiconductors, for, ics, are, mass, produced, to, create, an, ideal, semiconducting, material, chemical, purity, is, paramount, any, small, imperfection, can, have, a, drastic, effect, on, how, the, semiconducting, material, behaves, due, to, the, scale, at, which, the, materials, are, used, a, high, degree, of, crystalline, perfection, is, also, required, since, faults, in, the, crystal, structure, such, as, dislocations, twins, and, stacking, faults, interfere, with, the, semiconducting, properties, of, the, material, crystalline, faults, are, a, major, cause, of, defective, semiconductor, devices, the, larger, the, crystal, the, more, difficult, it, is, to, achieve, the, necessary, perfection, current, mass, production, processes, use, crystal, ingots, between, 100, and, 300, mm, 3, 9, and, 11, 8, in, in, diameter, grown, as, cylinders, and, sliced, into, wafers, there, is, a, combination, of, processes, that, are, used, to, prepare, semiconducting, materials, for, ics, one, process, is, called, thermal, oxidation, which, forms, silicon, dioxide, on, the, surface, of, the, silicon, this, is, used, as, a, gate, insulator, and, field, oxide, other, processes, are, called, photomasks, and, photolithography, this, process, is, what, creates, the, patterns, on, the, circuit, in, the, integrated, circuit, ultraviolet, light, is, used, along, with, a, photoresist, layer, to, create, a, chemical, change, that, generates, the, patterns, for, the, circuit, the, etching, is, the, next, process, that, is, required, the, part, of, the, silicon, that, was, not, covered, by, the, photoresist, layer, from, the, previous, step, can, now, be, etched, the, main, process, typically, used, today, is, called, plasma, etching, plasma, etching, usually, involves, an, etch, gas, pumped, in, a, low, pressure, chamber, to, create, plasma, a, common, etch, gas, is, chlorofluorocarbon, or, more, commonly, known, freon, a, high, radio, frequency, voltage, between, the, cathode, and, anode, is, what, creates, the, plasma, in, the, chamber, the, silicon, wafer, is, located, on, the, cathode, which, causes, it, to, be, hit, by, the, positively, charged, ions, that, are, released, from, the, plasma, the, result, is, silicon, that, is, etched, anisotropically, the, last, process, is, called, diffusion, this, is, the, process, that, gives, the, semiconducting, material, its, desired, semiconducting, properties, it, is, also, known, as, doping, the, process, introduces, an, impure, atom, to, the, system, which, creates, the, p, n, junction, to, get, the, impure, atoms, embedded, in, the, silicon, wafer, the, wafer, is, first, put, in, a, 1, 100, degree, celsius, chamber, the, atoms, are, injected, in, and, eventually, diffuse, with, the, silicon, after, the, process, is, completed, and, the, silicon, has, reached, room, temperature, the, doping, process, is, done, and, the, semiconducting, wafer, is, almost, prepared, semiconductors, are, defined, by, their, unique, electric, conductive, behavior, somewhere, between, that, of, a, conductor, and, an, insulator, the, differences, between, these, materials, can, be, understood, in, terms, of, the, quantum, states, for, electrons, each, of, which, may, contain, zero, or, one, electron, by, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, these, states, are, associated, with, the, electronic, band, structure, of, the, material, electrical, conductivity, arises, due, to, the, presence, of, electrons, in, states, that, are, delocalized, extending, through, the, material, however, in, order, to, transport, electrons, a, state, must, be, partially, filled, containing, an, electron, only, part, of, the, time, if, the, state, is, always, occupied, with, an, electron, then, it, is, inert, blocking, the, passage, of, other, electrons, via, that, state, the, energies, of, these, quantum, states, are, critical, since, a, state, is, partially, filled, only, if, its, energy, is, near, the, fermi, level, see, fermi, dirac, statistics, high, conductivity, in, material, comes, from, it, having, many, partially, filled, states, and, much, state, delocalization, metals, are, good, electrical, conductors, and, have, many, partially, filled, states, with, energies, near, their, fermi, level, insulators, by, contrast, have, few, partially, filled, states, their, fermi, levels, sit, within, band, gaps, with, few, energy, states, to, occupy, importantly, an, insulator, can, be, made, to, conduct, by, increasing, its, temperature, heating, provides, energy, to, promote, some, electrons, across, the, band, gap, inducing, partially, filled, states, in, both, the, band, of, states, beneath, the, band, gap, valence, band, and, the, band, of, states, above, the, band, gap, conduction, band, an, intrinsic, semiconductor, has, a, band, gap, that, is, smaller, than, that, of, an, insulator, and, at, room, temperature, significant, numbers, of, electrons, can, be, excited, to, cross, the, band, gap, a, pure, semiconductor, however, is, not, very, useful, as, it, is, neither, a, very, good, insulator, nor, a, very, good, conductor, however, one, important, feature, of, semiconductors, and, some, insulators, known, as, semi, insulators, is, that, their, conductivity, can, be, increased, and, controlled, by, doping, with, impurities, and, gating, with, electric, fields, doping, and, gating, move, either, the, conduction, or, valence, band, much, closer, to, the, fermi, level, and, greatly, increase, the, number, of, partially, filled, states, some, wider, bandgap, semiconductor, materials, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, semi, insulators, when, undoped, these, have, electrical, conductivity, nearer, to, that, of, electrical, insulators, however, they, can, be, doped, making, them, as, useful, as, semiconductors, semi, insulators, find, niche, applications, in, micro, electronics, such, as, substrates, for, hemt, an, example, of, a, common, semi, insulator, is, gallium, arsenide, some, materials, such, as, titanium, dioxide, can, even, be, used, as, insulating, materials, for, some, applications, while, being, treated, as, wide, gap, semiconductors, for, other, applications, the, partial, filling, of, the, states, at, the, bottom, of, the, conduction, band, can, be, understood, as, adding, electrons, to, that, band, the, electrons, do, not, stay, indefinitely, due, to, the, natural, thermal, recombination, but, they, can, move, around, for, some, time, the, actual, concentration, of, electrons, is, typically, very, dilute, and, so, unlike, in, metals, it, is, possible, to, think, of, the, electrons, in, the, conduction, band, of, a, semiconductor, as, a, sort, of, classical, ideal, gas, where, the, electrons, fly, around, freely, without, being, subject, to, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, in, most, semiconductors, the, conduction, bands, have, a, parabolic, dispersion, relation, and, so, these, electrons, respond, to, forces, electric, field, magnetic, field, etc, much, as, they, would, in, a, vacuum, though, with, a, different, effective, mass, because, the, electrons, behave, like, an, ideal, gas, one, may, also, think, about, conduction, in, very, simplistic, terms, such, as, the, drude, model, and, introduce, concepts, such, as, electron, mobility, for, partial, filling, at, the, top, of, the, valence, band, it, is, helpful, to, introduce, the, concept, of, an, electron, hole, although, the, electrons, in, the, valence, band, are, always, moving, around, a, completely, full, valence, band, is, inert, not, conducting, any, current, if, an, electron, is, taken, out, of, the, valence, band, then, the, trajectory, that, the, electron, would, normally, have, taken, is, now, missing, its, charge, for, the, purposes, of, electric, current, this, combination, of, the, full, valence, band, minus, the, electron, can, be, converted, into, a, picture, of, a, completely, empty, band, containing, a, positively, charged, particle, that, moves, in, the, same, way, as, the, electron, combined, with, the, negative, effective, mass, of, the, electrons, at, the, top, of, the, valence, band, we, arrive, at, a, picture, of, a, positively, charged, particle, that, responds, to, electric, and, magnetic, fields, just, as, a, normal, positively, charged, particle, would, do, in, a, vacuum, again, with, some, positive, effective, mass, this, particle, is, called, a, hole, and, the, collection, of, holes, in, the, valence, band, can, again, be, understood, in, simple, classical, terms, as, with, the, electrons, in, the, conduction, band, when, ionizing, radiation, strikes, a, semiconductor, it, may, excite, an, electron, out, of, its, energy, level, and, consequently, leave, a, hole, this, process, is, known, as, electron, hole, pair, generation, electron, hole, pairs, are, constantly, generated, from, thermal, energy, as, well, in, the, absence, of, any, external, energy, source, electron, hole, pairs, are, also, apt, to, recombine, conservation, of, energy, demands, that, these, recombination, events, in, which, an, electron, loses, an, amount, of, energy, larger, than, the, band, gap, be, accompanied, by, the, emission, of, thermal, energy, in, the, form, of, phonons, or, radiation, in, the, form, of, photons, in, some, states, the, generation, and, recombination, of, electron, hole, pairs, are, in, equipoise, the, number, of, electron, hole, pairs, in, the, steady, state, at, a, given, temperature, is, determined, by, quantum, statistical, mechanics, the, precise, quantum, mechanical, mechanisms, of, generation, and, recombination, are, governed, by, the, conservation, of, energy, and, conservation, of, momentum, as, the, probability, that, electrons, and, holes, meet, together, is, proportional, to, the, product, of, their, numbers, the, product, is, in, the, steady, state, nearly, constant, at, a, given, temperature, providing, that, there, is, no, significant, electric, field, which, might, flush, carriers, of, both, types, or, move, them, from, neighbor, regions, containing, more, of, them, to, meet, together, or, externally, driven, pair, generation, the, product, is, a, function, of, the, temperature, as, the, probability, of, getting, enough, thermal, energy, to, produce, a, pair, increases, with, temperature, being, approximately, exp, e, g, kt, where, k, is, the, boltzmann, constant, t, is, the, absolute, temperature, and, e, g, is, bandgap, the, probability, of, meeting, is, increased, by, carrier, traps, impurities, or, dislocations, which, can, trap, an, electron, or, hole, and, hold, it, until, a, pair, is, completed, such, carrier, traps, are, sometimes, purposely, added, to, reduce, the, time, needed, to, reach, the, steady, state, the, conductivity, of, semiconductors, may, easily, be, modified, by, introducing, impurities, into, their, crystal, lattice, the, process, of, adding, controlled, impurities, to, a, semiconductor, is, known, as, doping, the, amount, of, impurity, or, dopant, added, to, an, intrinsic, pure, semiconductor, varies, its, level, of, conductivity, doped, semiconductors, are, referred, to, as, extrinsic, by, adding, impurity, to, the, pure, semiconductors, the, electrical, conductivity, may, be, varied, by, factors, of, thousands, or, millions, a, 1, cm, 3, specimen, of, a, metal, or, semiconductor, has, the, order, of, 10, 22, atoms, in, a, metal, every, atom, donates, at, least, one, free, electron, for, conduction, thus, 1, cm, 3, of, metal, contains, on, the, order, of, 10, 22, free, electrons, whereas, a, 1, cm, 3, sample, of, pure, germanium, at, 20, c, contains, about, 4, 2, 10, 22, atoms, but, only, 2, 5, 10, 13, free, electrons, and, 2, 5, 10, 13, holes, the, addition, of, 0, 001, of, arsenic, an, impurity, donates, an, extra, 10, 17, free, electrons, in, the, same, volume, and, the, electrical, conductivity, is, increased, by, a, factor, of, 10, 000, the, materials, chosen, as, suitable, dopants, depend, on, the, atomic, properties, of, both, the, dopant, and, the, material, to, be, doped, in, general, dopants, that, produce, the, desired, controlled, changes, are, classified, as, either, electron, acceptors, or, donors, semiconductors, doped, with, donor, impurities, are, called, n, type, while, those, doped, with, acceptor, impurities, are, known, as, p, type, the, n, and, p, type, designations, indicate, which, charge, carrier, acts, as, the, material, s, majority, carrier, the, opposite, carrier, is, called, the, minority, carrier, which, exists, due, to, thermal, excitation, at, a, much, lower, concentration, compared, to, the, majority, carrier, for, example, the, pure, semiconductor, silicon, has, four, valence, electrons, that, bond, each, silicon, atom, to, its, neighbors, in, silicon, the, most, common, dopants, are, group, iii, and, group, v, elements, group, iii, elements, all, contain, three, valence, electrons, causing, them, to, function, as, acceptors, when, used, to, dope, silicon, when, an, acceptor, atom, replaces, a, silicon, atom, in, the, crystal, a, vacant, state, an, electron, hole, is, created, which, can, move, around, the, lattice, and, function, as, a, charge, carrier, group, v, elements, have, five, valence, electrons, which, allows, them, to, act, as, a, donor, substitution, of, these, atoms, for, silicon, creates, an, extra, free, electron, therefore, a, silicon, crystal, doped, with, boron, creates, a, p, type, semiconductor, whereas, one, doped, with, phosphorus, results, in, an, n, type, material, during, manufacture, dopants, can, be, diffused, into, the, semiconductor, body, by, contact, with, gaseous, compounds, of, the, desired, element, or, ion, implantation, can, be, used, to, accurately, position, the, doped, regions, some, materials, when, rapidly, cooled, to, a, glassy, amorphous, state, have, semiconducting, properties, these, include, b, si, ge, se, and, te, and, there, are, multiple, theories, to, explain, them, the, history, of, the, understanding, of, semiconductors, begins, with, experiments, on, the, electrical, properties, of, materials, the, properties, of, the, time, temperature, coefficient, of, resistance, rectification, and, light, sensitivity, were, observed, starting, in, the, early, 19th, century, thomas, johann, seebeck, was, the, first, to, notice, that, semiconductors, exhibit, special, feature, such, that, experiment, concerning, an, seebeck, effect, emerged, with, much, stronger, result, when, applying, semiconductors, in, 1821, in, 1833, michael, faraday, reported, that, the, resistance, of, specimens, of, silver, sulfide, decreases, when, they, are, heated, this, is, contrary, to, the, behavior, of, metallic, substances, such, as, copper, in, 1839, alexandre, edmond, becquerel, reported, observation, of, a, voltage, between, a, solid, and, a, liquid, electrolyte, when, struck, by, light, the, photovoltaic, effect, in, 1873, willoughby, smith, observed, that, selenium, resistors, exhibit, decreasing, resistance, when, light, falls, on, them, in, 1874, karl, ferdinand, braun, observed, conduction, and, rectification, in, metallic, sulfides, although, this, effect, had, been, discovered, much, earlier, by, peter, munck, af, rosensch, ld, sv, writing, for, the, annalen, der, physik, und, chemie, in, 1835, and, arthur, schuster, found, that, a, copper, oxide, layer, on, wires, had, rectification, properties, that, ceased, when, the, wires, are, cleaned, william, grylls, adams, and, richard, evans, day, observed, the, photovoltaic, effect, in, selenium, in, 1876, a, unified, explanation, of, these, phenomena, required, a, theory, of, solid, state, physics, which, developed, greatly, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, in, 1878, edwin, herbert, hall, demonstrated, the, deflection, of, flowing, charge, carriers, by, an, applied, magnetic, field, the, hall, effect, the, discovery, of, the, electron, by, j, j, thomson, in, 1897, prompted, theories, of, electron, based, conduction, in, solids, karl, baedeker, by, observing, a, hall, effect, with, the, reverse, sign, to, that, in, metals, theorized, that, copper, iodide, had, positive, charge, carriers, johan, koenigsberger, classified, solid, materials, like, metals, insulators, and, variable, conductors, in, 1914, although, his, student, josef, weiss, already, introduced, the, term, halbleiter, a, semiconductor, in, modern, meaning, in, his, ph, d, thesis, in, 1910, felix, bloch, published, a, theory, of, the, movement, of, electrons, through, atomic, lattices, in, 1928, in, 1930, b, gudden, stated, that, conductivity, in, semiconductors, was, due, to, minor, concentrations, of, impurities, by, 1931, the, band, theory, of, conduction, had, been, established, by, alan, herries, wilson, and, the, concept, of, band, gaps, had, been, developed, walter, h, schottky, and, nevill, francis, mott, developed, models, of, the, potential, barrier, and, of, the, characteristics, of, a, metal, semiconductor, junction, by, 1938, boris, davydov, had, developed, a, theory, of, the, copper, oxide, rectifier, identifying, the, effect, of, the, p, n, junction, and, the, importance, of, minority, carriers, and, surface, states, agreement, between, theoretical, predictions, based, on, developing, quantum, mechanics, and, experimental, results, was, sometimes, poor, this, was, later, explained, by, john, bardeen, as, due, to, the, extreme, structure, sensitive, behavior, of, semiconductors, whose, properties, change, dramatically, based, on, tiny, amounts, of, impurities, commercially, pure, materials, of, the, 1920s, containing, varying, proportions, of, trace, contaminants, produced, differing, experimental, results, this, spurred, the, development, of, improved, material, refining, techniques, culminating, in, modern, semiconductor, refineries, producing, materials, with, parts, per, trillion, purity, devices, using, semiconductors, were, at, first, constructed, based, on, empirical, knowledge, before, semiconductor, theory, provided, a, guide, to, the, construction, of, more, capable, and, reliable, devices, alexander, graham, bell, used, the, light, sensitive, property, of, selenium, to, transmit, sound, over, a, beam, of, light, in, 1880, a, working, solar, cell, of, low, efficiency, was, constructed, by, charles, fritts, in, 1883, using, a, metal, plate, coated, with, selenium, and, a, thin, layer, of, gold, the, device, became, commercially, useful, in, photographic, light, meters, in, the, 1930s, point, contact, microwave, detector, rectifiers, made, of, lead, sulfide, were, used, by, jagadish, chandra, bose, in, 1904, the, cat, s, whisker, detector, using, natural, galena, or, other, materials, became, a, common, device, in, the, development, of, radio, however, it, was, somewhat, unpredictable, in, operation, and, required, manual, adjustment, for, best, performance, in, 1906, h, j, round, observed, light, emission, when, electric, current, passed, through, silicon, carbide, crystals, the, principle, behind, the, light, emitting, diode, oleg, losev, observed, similar, light, emission, in, 1922, but, at, the, time, the, effect, had, no, practical, use, power, rectifiers, using, copper, oxide, and, selenium, were, developed, in, the, 1920s, and, became, commercially, important, as, an, alternative, to, vacuum, tube, rectifiers, the, first, semiconductor, devices, used, galena, including, german, physicist, ferdinand, braun, s, crystal, detector, in, 1874, and, indian, physicist, jagadish, chandra, bose, s, radio, crystal, detector, in, 1901, in, the, years, preceding, world, war, ii, infrared, detection, and, communications, devices, prompted, research, into, lead, sulfide, and, lead, selenide, materials, these, devices, were, used, for, detecting, ships, and, aircraft, for, infrared, rangefinders, and, for, voice, communication, systems, the, point, contact, crystal, detector, became, vital, for, microwave, radio, systems, since, available, vacuum, tube, devices, could, not, serve, as, detectors, above, about, 4000, mhz, advanced, radar, systems, relied, on, the, fast, response, of, crystal, detectors, considerable, research, and, development, of, silicon, materials, occurred, during, the, war, to, develop, detectors, of, consistent, quality, detector, and, power, rectifiers, could, not, amplify, a, signal, many, efforts, were, made, to, develop, a, solid, state, amplifier, and, were, successful, in, developing, a, device, called, the, point, contact, transistor, which, could, amplify, 20, db, or, more, in, 1922, oleg, losev, developed, two, terminal, negative, resistance, amplifiers, for, radio, but, he, died, in, the, siege, of, leningrad, after, successful, completion, in, 1926, julius, edgar, lilienfeld, patented, a, device, resembling, a, field, effect, transistor, but, it, was, not, practical, r, hilsch, and, r, w, pohl, in, 1938, demonstrated, a, solid, state, amplifier, using, a, structure, resembling, the, control, grid, of, a, vacuum, tube, although, the, device, displayed, power, gain, it, had, a, cut, off, frequency, of, one, cycle, per, second, too, low, for, any, practical, applications, but, an, effective, application, of, the, available, theory, at, bell, labs, william, shockley, and, a, holden, started, investigating, solid, state, amplifiers, in, 1938, the, first, p, n, junction, in, silicon, was, observed, by, russell, ohl, about, 1941, when, a, specimen, was, found, to, be, light, sensitive, with, a, sharp, boundary, between, p, type, impurity, at, one, end, and, n, type, at, the, other, a, slice, cut, from, the, specimen, at, the, p, n, boundary, developed, a, voltage, when, exposed, to, light, the, first, working, transistor, was, a, point, contact, transistor, invented, by, john, bardeen, walter, houser, brattain, and, william, shockley, at, bell, labs, in, 1947, shockley, had, earlier, theorized, a, field, effect, amplifier, made, from, germanium, and, silicon, but, he, failed, to, build, such, a, working, device, before, eventually, using, germanium, to, invent, the, point, contact, transistor, in, france, during, the, war, herbert, matar, had, observed, amplification, between, adjacent, point, contacts, on, a, germanium, base, after, the, war, matar, s, group, announced, their, transistron, amplifier, only, shortly, after, bell, labs, announced, the, transistor, in, 1954, physical, chemist, morris, tanenbaum, fabricated, the, first, silicon, junction, transistor, at, bell, labs, however, early, junction, transistors, were, relatively, bulky, devices, that, were, difficult, to, manufacture, on, a, mass, production, basis, which, limited, them, to, a, number, of, specialised, applications
