allotropy, or, allotropism, from, ancient, greek, allos, other, and, tropos, manner, form, is, the, property, of, some, chemical, elements, to, exist, in, two, or, more, different, forms, in, the, same, physical, state, known, as, allotropes, of, the, elements, allotropes, are, different, structural, modifications, of, an, element, the, atoms, of, the, element, are, bonded, together, in, different, manners, for, example, the, allotropes, of, carbon, include, diamond, the, carbon, atoms, are, bonded, together, to, form, a, cubic, lattice, of, tetrahedra, graphite, the, carbon, atoms, are, bonded, together, in, sheets, of, a, hexagonal, lattice, graphene, single, sheets, of, graphite, and, fullerenes, the, carbon, atoms, are, bonded, together, in, spherical, tubular, or, ellipsoidal, formations, the, term, allotropy, is, used, for, elements, only, not, for, compounds, the, more, general, term, used, for, any, compound, is, polymorphism, although, its, use, is, usually, restricted, to, solid, materials, such, as, crystals, allotropy, refers, only, to, different, forms, of, an, element, within, the, same, physical, phase, the, state, of, matter, such, as, a, solid, liquid, or, gas, the, differences, between, these, states, of, matter, would, not, alone, constitute, examples, of, allotropy, allotropes, of, chemical, elements, are, frequently, referred, to, as, polymorphs, or, as, phases, of, the, element, for, some, elements, allotropes, have, different, molecular, formulae, or, different, crystalline, structures, as, well, as, a, difference, in, physical, phase, for, example, two, allotropes, of, oxygen, dioxygen, o, 2, and, ozone, o, 3, can, both, exist, in, the, solid, liquid, and, gaseous, states, other, elements, do, not, maintain, distinct, allotropes, in, different, physical, phases, for, example, phosphorus, has, numerous, solid, allotropes, which, all, revert, to, the, same, p, 4, form, when, melted, to, the, liquid, state, the, concept, of, allotropy, was, originally, proposed, in, 1840, by, the, swedish, scientist, baron, j, ns, jakob, berzelius, 1779, 1848, the, term, is, derived, from, greek, allotropia, variability, changeableness, after, the, acceptance, of, avogadro, s, hypothesis, in, 1860, it, was, understood, that, elements, could, exist, as, polyatomic, molecules, and, two, allotropes, of, oxygen, were, recognized, as, o, 2, and, o, 3, in, the, early, 20th, century, it, was, recognized, that, other, cases, such, as, carbon, were, due, to, differences, in, crystal, structure, by, 1912, ostwald, noted, that, the, allotropy, of, elements, is, just, a, special, case, of, the, phenomenon, of, polymorphism, known, for, compounds, and, proposed, that, the, terms, allotrope, and, allotropy, be, abandoned, and, replaced, by, polymorph, and, polymorphism, although, many, other, chemists, have, repeated, this, advice, iupac, and, most, chemistry, texts, still, favour, the, usage, of, allotrope, and, allotropy, for, elements, only, allotropes, are, different, structural, forms, of, the, same, element, and, can, exhibit, quite, different, physical, properties, and, chemical, behaviours, the, change, between, allotropic, forms, is, triggered, by, the, same, forces, that, affect, other, structures, i, e, pressure, light, and, temperature, therefore, the, stability, of, the, particular, allotropes, depends, on, particular, conditions, for, instance, iron, changes, from, a, body, centered, cubic, structure, ferrite, to, a, face, centered, cubic, structure, austenite, above, 906, c, and, tin, undergoes, a, modification, known, as, tin, pest, from, a, metallic, form, to, a, semimetallic, form, below, 13, 2, c, 55, 8, f, as, an, example, of, allotropes, having, different, chemical, behaviour, ozone, o, 3, is, a, much, stronger, oxidizing, agent, than, dioxygen, o, 2, typically, elements, capable, of, variable, coordination, number, and, or, oxidation, states, tend, to, exhibit, greater, numbers, of, allotropic, forms, another, contributing, factor, is, the, ability, of, an, element, to, catenate, examples, of, allotropes, include, among, the, metallic, elements, that, occur, in, nature, in, significant, quantities, 56, up, to, u, without, tc, and, pm, almost, half, 27, are, allotropic, at, ambient, pressure, li, be, na, ca, ti, mn, fe, co, sr, y, zr, sn, la, ce, pr, nd, sm, gd, tb, dy, yb, hf, tl, th, pa, and, u, some, phase, transitions, between, allotropic, forms, of, technologically, relevant, metals, are, those, of, ti, at, 882, c, fe, at, 912, c, and, 1394, c, co, at, 422, c, zr, at, 863, c, sn, at, 13, c, and, u, at, 668, c, and, 776, c, most, stable, structure, under, standard, conditions, structures, stable, below, room, temperature, structures, stable, above, room, temperature, structures, stable, above, atmospheric, pressure, in, 2017, the, concept, of, nanoallotropy, was, proposed, nanoallotropes, or, allotropes, of, nanomaterials, are, nanoporous, materials, that, have, the, same, chemical, composition, e, g, au, but, differ, in, their, architecture, at, the, nanoscale, that, is, on, a, scale, 10, to, 100, times, the, dimensions, of, individual, atoms, such, nanoallotropes, may, help, create, ultra, small, electronic, devices, and, find, other, industrial, applications, the, different, nanoscale, architectures, translate, into, different, properties, as, was, demonstrated, for, surface, enhanced, raman, scattering, performed, on, several, different, nanoallotropes, of, gold, a, two, step, method, for, generating, nanoallotropes, was, also, created
