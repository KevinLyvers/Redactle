conglomerate, k, n, l, m, r, t, is, a, clastic, sedimentary, rock, that, is, composed, of, a, substantial, fraction, of, rounded, to, subangular, gravel, size, clasts, a, conglomerate, typically, contains, a, matrix, of, finer, grained, sediments, such, as, sand, silt, or, clay, which, fills, the, interstices, between, the, clasts, the, clasts, and, matrix, are, typically, cemented, by, calcium, carbonate, iron, oxide, silica, or, hardened, clay, conglomerates, form, by, the, consolidation, and, lithification, of, gravel, they, can, be, found, in, sedimentary, rock, sequences, of, all, ages, but, probably, make, up, less, than, 1, percent, by, weight, of, all, sedimentary, rocks, in, terms, of, origin, and, depositional, mechanisms, they, are, closely, related, to, sandstones, and, exhibit, many, of, the, same, types, of, sedimentary, structures, e, g, tabular, and, trough, cross, bedding, and, graded, bedding, fanglomerates, are, poorly, sorted, matrix, rich, conglomerates, that, originated, as, debris, flows, on, alluvial, fans, and, likely, contain, the, largest, accumulations, of, gravel, in, the, geologic, record, conglomerates, may, be, named, and, classified, by, the, the, classification, method, depends, on, the, type, and, detail, of, research, being, conducted, a, sedimentary, rock, composed, largely, of, gravel, is, first, named, according, to, the, roundness, of, the, gravel, if, the, gravel, clasts, that, comprise, it, are, largely, well, rounded, to, subrounded, it, is, a, conglomerate, if, the, gravel, clasts, that, comprise, it, are, largely, angular, it, is, a, breccia, such, breccias, can, be, called, sedimentary, breccias, to, differentiate, them, from, other, types, of, breccia, e, g, volcanic, and, fault, breccias, sedimentary, rocks, that, contain, a, mixture, of, rounded, and, angular, gravel, clasts, are, sometimes, called, breccio, conglomerate, conglomerates, contain, at, least, 30, of, rounded, to, subangular, clasts, larger, than, 2, mm, 0, 079, in, in, diameter, e, g, granules, pebbles, cobbles, and, boulders, however, conglomerates, are, rarely, composed, entirely, of, gravel, size, clasts, typically, the, space, between, the, gravel, size, clasts, is, filled, by, a, mixture, composed, of, varying, amounts, of, silt, sand, and, clay, known, as, matrix, if, the, individual, gravel, clasts, in, a, conglomerate, are, separated, from, each, other, by, an, abundance, of, matrix, such, that, they, are, not, in, contact, with, each, other, and, float, within, the, matrix, it, is, called, a, paraconglomerate, paraconglomerates, are, also, often, unstratified, and, can, contain, more, matrix, than, gravel, clasts, if, the, gravel, clasts, of, a, conglomerate, are, in, contact, with, each, other, it, is, called, an, orthoconglomerate, unlike, paraconglomerates, orthoconglomerates, are, typically, cross, bedded, and, often, well, cemented, and, lithified, by, either, calcite, hematite, quartz, or, clay, the, differences, between, paraconglomerates, and, orthoconglomerates, reflect, differences, in, how, they, are, deposited, paraconglomerates, are, commonly, either, glacial, tills, or, debris, flow, deposits, orthoconglomerates, are, typically, associated, with, aqueous, currents, conglomerates, are, also, classified, according, to, the, composition, of, their, clasts, a, conglomerate, or, any, clastic, sedimentary, rock, that, consists, of, a, single, rock, or, mineral, is, known, as, either, a, monomict, monomictic, oligomict, or, oligomictic, conglomerate, if, the, conglomerate, consists, of, two, or, more, different, types, of, rocks, minerals, or, combination, of, both, it, is, known, as, either, a, polymict, or, polymictic, conglomerate, if, a, polymictic, conglomerate, contains, an, assortment, of, the, clasts, of, metastable, and, unstable, rocks, and, minerals, it, is, called, either, a, petromict, or, petromictic, conglomerate, in, addition, conglomerates, are, classified, by, source, as, indicated, by, the, lithology, of, the, gravel, size, clasts, if, these, clasts, consist, of, rocks, and, minerals, that, are, significantly, different, in, lithology, from, the, enclosing, matrix, and, thus, older, and, derived, from, outside, the, basin, of, deposition, the, conglomerate, is, known, as, an, extraformational, conglomerate, if, these, clasts, consist, of, rocks, and, minerals, that, are, identical, to, or, consistent, with, the, lithology, of, the, enclosing, matrix, and, thus, penecontemporaneous, and, derived, from, within, the, basin, of, deposition, the, conglomerate, is, known, as, an, intraformational, conglomerate, two, recognized, types, of, intraformational, conglomerates, are, shale, pebble, and, flat, pebble, conglomerates, a, shale, pebble, conglomerate, is, a, conglomerate, that, is, composed, largely, of, clasts, of, rounded, mud, chips, and, pebbles, held, together, by, clay, minerals, and, created, by, erosion, within, environments, such, as, within, a, river, channel, or, along, a, lake, margin, flat, pebble, conglomerates, edgewise, conglomerates, are, conglomerates, that, consist, of, relatively, flat, clasts, of, lime, mud, created, by, either, storms, or, tsunami, eroding, a, shallow, sea, bottom, or, tidal, currents, eroding, tidal, flats, along, a, shoreline, finally, conglomerates, are, often, differentiated, and, named, according, to, the, dominant, clast, size, comprising, them, in, this, classification, a, conglomerate, composed, largely, of, granule, size, clasts, would, be, called, a, granule, conglomerate, a, conglomerate, composed, largely, of, pebble, size, clasts, would, be, called, a, pebble, conglomerate, and, a, conglomerate, composed, largely, of, cobble, size, clasts, would, be, called, a, cobble, conglomerate, conglomerates, are, deposited, in, a, variety, of, sedimentary, environments, in, turbidites, the, basal, part, of, a, bed, is, typically, coarse, grained, and, sometimes, conglomeratic, in, this, setting, conglomerates, are, normally, very, well, sorted, well, rounded, and, often, with, a, strong, a, axis, type, imbrication, of, the, clasts, conglomerates, are, normally, present, at, the, base, of, sequences, laid, down, during, marine, transgressions, above, an, unconformity, and, are, known, as, basal, conglomerates, they, represent, the, position, of, the, shoreline, at, a, particular, time, and, are, diachronous, conglomerates, deposited, in, fluvial, environments, are, typically, well, rounded, and, poorly, sorted, clasts, of, this, size, are, carried, as, bedload, and, only, at, times, of, high, flow, rate, the, maximum, clast, size, decreases, as, the, clasts, are, transported, further, due, to, attrition, so, conglomerates, are, more, characteristic, of, immature, river, systems, in, the, sediments, deposited, by, mature, rivers, conglomerates, are, generally, confined, to, the, basal, part, of, a, channel, fill, where, they, are, known, as, pebble, lags, conglomerates, deposited, in, a, fluvial, environment, often, have, an, ab, plane, type, imbrication, alluvial, deposits, form, in, areas, of, high, relief, and, are, typically, coarse, grained, at, mountain, fronts, individual, alluvial, fans, merge, to, form, braidplains, and, these, two, environments, are, associated, with, the, thickest, deposits, of, conglomerates, the, bulk, of, conglomerates, deposited, in, this, setting, are, clast, supported, with, a, strong, ab, plane, imbrication, matrix, supported, conglomerates, as, a, result, of, debris, flow, deposition, are, quite, commonly, associated, with, many, alluvial, fans, when, such, conglomerates, accumulate, within, an, alluvial, fan, in, rapidly, eroding, e, g, desert, environments, the, resulting, rock, unit, is, often, called, a, fanglomerate, glaciers, carry, a, lot, of, coarse, grained, material, and, many, glacial, deposits, are, conglomeratic, tillites, the, sediments, deposited, directly, by, a, glacier, are, typically, poorly, sorted, matrix, supported, conglomerates, the, matrix, is, generally, fine, grained, consisting, of, finely, milled, rock, fragments, waterlaid, deposits, associated, with, glaciers, are, often, conglomeratic, forming, structures, such, as, eskers, an, example, of, conglomerate, can, be, seen, at, montserrat, near, barcelona, here, erosion, has, created, vertical, channels, that, give, the, characteristic, jagged, shapes, the, mountain, is, named, for, montserrat, literally, means, jagged, mountain, the, rock, is, strong, enough, to, use, as, a, building, material, as, in, the, santa, maria, de, montserrat, abbey, another, example, the, crestone, conglomerate, occurs, in, and, near, the, town, of, crestone, at, the, foot, of, the, sangre, de, cristo, range, in, colorado, s, san, luis, valley, the, crestone, conglomerate, consists, of, poorly, sorted, fanglomerates, that, accumulated, in, prehistoric, alluvial, fans, and, related, fluvial, systems, some, of, these, rocks, have, hues, of, red, and, green, conglomerate, cliffs, are, found, on, the, east, coast, of, scotland, from, arbroath, northwards, along, the, coastlines, of, the, former, counties, of, angus, and, kincardineshire, dunnottar, castle, sits, on, a, rugged, promontory, of, conglomerate, jutting, into, the, north, sea, just, south, of, the, town, of, stonehaven, copper, harbor, conglomerate, is, found, both, in, the, keweenaw, peninsula, and, isle, royale, national, park, in, lake, superior, conglomerate, may, also, be, seen, in, the, domed, hills, of, kata, tjuta, in, australia, s, northern, territory, or, in, the, buda, hills, in, hungary, in, the, nineteenth, century, a, thick, layer, of, pottsville, conglomerate, was, recognized, to, underlie, anthracite, coal, measures, in, pennsylvania, on, mars, slabs, of, conglomerate, have, been, found, at, an, outcrop, named, hottah, and, have, been, interpreted, by, scientists, as, having, formed, in, an, ancient, streambed, the, gravels, which, were, discovered, by, nasa, s, mars, rover, curiosity, range, from, the, size, of, sand, particles, to, the, size, of, golf, balls, analysis, has, shown, that, the, pebbles, were, deposited, by, a, stream, that, flowed, at, walking, pace, and, was, ankle, to, hip, deep, metamorphic, alteration, transforms, conglomerate, into, metaconglomerate
