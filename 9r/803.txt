a, dry, lake, bed, also, known, as, a, playa, p, l, a, is, a, basin, or, depression, that, formerly, contained, a, standing, surface, water, body, which, disappears, when, evaporation, processes, exceed, recharge, if, the, floor, of, a, dry, lake, is, covered, by, deposits, of, alkaline, compounds, it, is, known, as, an, alkali, flat, if, covered, with, salt, it, is, known, as, a, salt, flat, if, its, basin, is, primarily, salt, then, a, dry, lake, bed, is, called, a, salt, pan, pan, or, salt, flat, the, latter, being, a, remnant, of, a, salt, lake, hardpan, is, the, dry, terminus, of, an, internally, drained, basin, in, a, dry, climate, a, designation, typically, used, in, the, great, basin, of, the, western, united, states, another, term, for, dry, lake, bed, is, playa, the, spanish, word, playa, pronounced, literally, means, beach, dry, lakes, are, known, by, this, name, in, some, parts, of, mexico, and, the, western, united, states, this, term, is, used, e, g, on, the, llano, estacado, and, other, parts, of, the, southern, high, plains, and, is, commonly, used, to, address, paleolake, sediments, in, the, sahara, like, lake, ptolemy, in, south, america, the, usual, term, for, a, dry, lake, bed, is, salar, or, salina, spanish, for, salt, pan, pan, is, the, term, used, in, most, of, south, africa, these, may, include, the, small, round, highveld, pans, typical, of, the, chrissiesmeer, area, to, the, extensive, pans, of, the, northern, cape, province, terms, used, in, australia, include, salt, pans, where, evaporite, minerals, are, present, and, clay, pans, in, arabic, a, salt, flat, is, called, a, sabkha, also, spelled, sabkhah, subkha, or, sebkha, or, shott, chott, in, central, asia, a, similar, cracked, mud, salt, flat, is, known, as, a, takyr, in, iran, salt, flats, are, called, kavir, a, dry, lake, is, formed, when, water, from, rain, or, other, sources, like, intersection, with, a, water, table, flows, into, a, dry, depression, in, the, landscape, creating, a, pond, or, lake, if, the, total, annual, evaporation, rate, exceeds, the, total, annual, inflow, the, depression, will, eventually, become, dry, again, forming, a, dry, lake, salts, originally, dissolved, in, the, water, precipitate, out, and, are, left, behind, gradually, building, up, over, time, a, dry, lake, appears, as, a, flat, bed, of, clay, generally, encrusted, with, precipitated, salts, these, evaporite, minerals, are, a, concentration, of, weathering, products, such, as, sodium, carbonate, borax, and, other, salts, in, deserts, a, dry, lake, may, be, found, in, an, area, ringed, by, bajadas, dry, lakes, are, typically, formed, in, semi, arid, to, arid, regions, of, the, world, the, largest, concentration, of, dry, lakes, nearly, 22, 000, is, in, the, southern, high, plains, of, texas, and, eastern, new, mexico, most, dry, lakes, are, small, however, salar, de, uyuni, in, bolivia, near, potos, the, largest, salt, flat, in, the, world, comprises, 4, 085, square, miles, 10, 582, square, km, many, dry, lakes, contain, shallow, water, during, the, rainy, season, especially, during, wet, years, if, the, layer, of, water, is, thin, and, is, moved, around, the, dry, lake, bed, by, wind, an, exceedingly, hard, and, smooth, surface, may, develop, thicker, layers, of, water, may, result, in, a, cracked, mud, surface, and, teepee, structure, desiccation, features, if, there, is, very, little, water, dunes, can, form, the, racetrack, playa, located, in, death, valley, california, features, a, geological, phenomenon, known, as, sailing, stones, that, leave, linear, racetrack, imprints, as, they, slowly, move, across, the, surface, without, human, or, animal, intervention, these, rocks, have, been, recently, filmed, in, motion, by, the, scripps, institution, of, oceanography, at, uc, san, diego, and, are, due, to, a, perfect, coincidence, of, events, first, the, playa, has, to, fill, with, water, which, must, be, deep, enough, to, form, floating, ice, during, winter, but, still, shallow, enough, that, the, rocks, are, exposed, when, the, temperature, drops, at, night, this, pond, freezes, into, thin, sheets, of, windowpane, ice, which, then, must, be, thick, enough, to, maintain, strength, but, thin, enough, to, move, freely, finally, when, the, sun, comes, out, the, ice, melts, and, cracks, into, floating, panels, these, are, blown, across, the, playa, by, light, winds, propelling, the, rocks, in, front, of, them, the, stones, only, move, once, every, two, or, three, years, and, most, tracks, last, for, three, or, four, years, while, a, dry, lake, bed, is, itself, typically, devoid, of, vegetation, they, are, commonly, ringed, by, shadscale, saltbrush, and, other, salt, tolerant, plants, that, provide, critical, winter, fodder, for, livestock, and, other, herbivores, in, southwest, idaho, and, parts, of, nevada, and, utah, there, are, a, number, of, rare, species, that, occur, nowhere, else, but, in, the, inhospitable, environment, of, seasonally, flooded, playas, a, new, species, of, giant, fairy, shrimp, was, found, in, 2006, although, a, large, predatory, species, it, evaded, detection, because, of, the, murkiness, of, the, playa, s, water, caused, by, winds, and, a, fine, clay, load, this, shrimp, species, is, able, to, regenerate, using, tiny, undetectable, cysts, that, can, remain, in, a, dry, lake, bed, for, years, until, conditions, are, optimum, for, hatching, lepidium, davisii, is, another, rare, species, a, perennial, plant, whose, habitat, is, restricted, to, playas, in, southern, idaho, and, northern, nevada, far, from, major, rivers, or, lakes, playas, are, often, the, only, water, available, to, wildlife, in, the, desert, antelope, and, other, wildlife, gather, there, after, rainstorms, to, drink, threats, to, dry, lakes, include, pollution, from, concentrated, animal, feeding, operations, such, as, cattle, feedlots, and, dairies, results, are, erosion, fertilizer, pesticide, and, sediment, runoff, from, farms, and, overgrazing, a, non, native, shrub, that, has, been, used, for, rangeland, restoration, in, the, west, kochia, prostrata, also, poses, a, significant, threat, to, playas, and, their, associated, rare, species, as, it, capable, of, crowding, out, native, vegetation, and, draining, a, playa, s, standing, water, because, of, its, root, growth, the, extremely, flat, smooth, and, hard, surfaces, of, dry, lake, beds, make, them, ideal, for, fast, motor, vehicles, and, motorcycles, large, sized, dry, lakes, are, excellent, spots, for, pursuing, land, speed, records, as, the, smoothness, of, the, surface, allows, low, clearance, vehicles, to, travel, very, fast, without, any, risk, of, disruption, by, surface, irregularities, and, the, path, traveled, has, no, obstacles, to, avoid, the, dry, lake, beds, at, bonneville, salt, flats, in, utah, and, black, rock, desert, in, nevada, have, both, been, used, for, setting, land, speed, records, lake, eyre, and, lake, gairdner, in, south, australia, have, also, been, used, for, various, land, speed, record, attempts, dry, lake, beds, that, rarely, fill, with, water, are, sometimes, used, as, locations, for, air, bases, for, similar, reasons, examples, include, groom, lake, at, area, 51, in, nevada, and, edwards, air, force, base, known, initially, as, muroc, dry, lake, in, california, brines, from, the, subsurface, of, dry, lakes, are, often, exploited, for, valuable, minerals, in, solution, see, for, example, searles, dry, lake, and, lithium, resources, under, united, states, law, a, playa, lake, may, be, considered, isolated, wetlands, and, may, be, eligible, to, enroll, in, the, new, wetlands, component, of, the, conservation, reserve, program, enacted, in, the, 2002, farm, bill, p, l, 107, 171, sec, 2101, the, burning, man, yearly, event, takes, place, in, a, playa, in, the, black, rock, desert, in, western, nevada, every, year, fangfang, yao, et, al, 2023, at, the, university, of, virginia, reported, that, more, than, half, of, the, world, s, large, lakes, are, drying, up, they, assessed, almost, 2, 000, large, lakes, using, satellite, measurements, combined, with, climate, and, hydrological, models, they, found, that, unsustainable, human, use, changes, in, rainfall, and, run, off, sedimentation, and, rising, temperatures, have, driven, lake, levels, down, globally, with, 53, of, lakes, showing, a, decline, from, 1992, to, 2020
