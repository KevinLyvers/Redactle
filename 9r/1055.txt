a, photon, from, ancient, greek, ph, s, ph, t, s, light, is, an, elementary, particle, that, is, a, quantum, of, the, electromagnetic, field, including, electromagnetic, radiation, such, as, light, and, radio, waves, and, the, force, carrier, for, the, electromagnetic, force, photons, are, massless, particles, that, always, move, at, the, speed, of, light, measured, in, vacuum, the, photon, belongs, to, the, class, of, boson, particles, as, with, other, elementary, particles, photons, are, best, explained, by, quantum, mechanics, and, exhibit, wave, particle, duality, their, behavior, featuring, properties, of, both, waves, and, particles, the, modern, photon, concept, originated, during, the, first, two, decades, of, the, 20th, century, with, the, work, of, albert, einstein, who, built, upon, the, research, of, max, planck, while, planck, was, trying, to, explain, how, matter, and, electromagnetic, radiation, could, be, in, thermal, equilibrium, with, one, another, he, proposed, that, the, energy, stored, within, a, material, object, should, be, regarded, as, composed, of, an, integer, number, of, discrete, equal, sized, parts, to, explain, the, photoelectric, effect, einstein, introduced, the, idea, that, light, itself, is, made, of, discrete, units, of, energy, in, 1926, gilbert, n, lewis, popularized, the, term, photon, for, these, energy, units, subsequently, many, other, experiments, validated, einstein, s, approach, in, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, photons, and, other, elementary, particles, are, described, as, a, necessary, consequence, of, physical, laws, having, a, certain, symmetry, at, every, point, in, spacetime, the, intrinsic, properties, of, particles, such, as, charge, mass, and, spin, are, determined, by, gauge, symmetry, the, photon, concept, has, led, to, momentous, advances, in, experimental, and, theoretical, physics, including, lasers, bose, einstein, condensation, quantum, field, theory, and, the, probabilistic, interpretation, of, quantum, mechanics, it, has, been, applied, to, photochemistry, high, resolution, microscopy, and, measurements, of, molecular, distances, moreover, photons, have, been, studied, as, elements, of, quantum, computers, and, for, applications, in, optical, imaging, and, optical, communication, such, as, quantum, cryptography, the, word, quanta, singular, quantum, latin, for, how, much, was, used, before, 1900, to, mean, particles, or, amounts, of, different, quantities, including, electricity, in, 1900, the, german, physicist, max, planck, was, studying, black, body, radiation, and, he, suggested, that, the, experimental, observations, specifically, at, shorter, wavelengths, would, be, explained, if, the, energy, stored, within, a, molecule, was, a, discrete, quantity, composed, of, an, integral, number, of, finite, equal, parts, which, he, called, energy, elements, in, 1905, albert, einstein, published, a, paper, in, which, he, proposed, that, many, light, related, phenomena, including, black, body, radiation, and, the, photoelectric, effect, would, be, better, explained, by, modelling, electromagnetic, waves, as, consisting, of, spatially, localized, discrete, wave, packets, he, called, such, a, wave, packet, a, light, quantum, german, ein, lichtquant, the, name, photon, derives, from, the, greek, word, for, light, transliterated, ph, s, arthur, compton, used, photon, in, 1928, referring, to, gilbert, n, lewis, who, coined, the, term, in, a, letter, to, nature, on, 18, december, 1926, the, same, name, was, used, earlier, but, was, never, widely, adopted, before, lewis, in, 1916, by, the, american, physicist, and, psychologist, leonard, t, troland, in, 1921, by, the, irish, physicist, john, joly, in, 1924, by, the, french, physiologist, ren, wurmser, 1890, 1993, and, in, 1926, by, the, french, physicist, frithiof, wolfers, 1891, 1971, the, name, was, suggested, initially, as, a, unit, related, to, the, illumination, of, the, eye, and, the, resulting, sensation, of, light, and, was, used, later, in, a, physiological, context, although, wolfers, s, and, lewis, s, theories, were, contradicted, by, many, experiments, and, never, accepted, the, new, name, was, adopted, by, most, physicists, very, soon, after, compton, used, it, in, physics, a, photon, is, usually, denoted, by, the, symbol, the, greek, letter, gamma, this, symbol, for, the, photon, probably, derives, from, gamma, rays, which, were, discovered, in, 1900, by, paul, villard, named, by, ernest, rutherford, in, 1903, and, shown, to, be, a, form, of, electromagnetic, radiation, in, 1914, by, rutherford, and, edward, andrade, in, chemistry, and, optical, engineering, photons, are, usually, symbolized, by, h, which, is, the, photon, energy, where, h, is, the, planck, constant, and, the, greek, letter, nu, is, the, photon, s, frequency, the, photon, has, no, electric, charge, is, generally, considered, to, have, zero, rest, mass, and, is, a, stable, particle, the, experimental, upper, limit, on, the, photon, mass, is, very, small, on, the, order, of, 10, 50, kg, its, lifetime, would, be, more, than, 10, 18, years, for, comparison, the, age, of, the, universe, is, about, 1, 38, 10, 10, years, in, a, vacuum, a, photon, has, two, possible, polarization, states, the, photon, is, the, gauge, boson, for, electromagnetism, 29, 30, and, therefore, all, other, quantum, numbers, of, the, photon, such, as, lepton, number, baryon, number, and, flavour, quantum, numbers, are, zero, also, the, photon, obeys, bose, einstein, statistics, and, not, fermi, dirac, statistics, that, is, they, do, not, obey, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, 1221, and, more, than, one, can, occupy, the, same, bound, quantum, state, photons, are, emitted, in, many, natural, processes, for, example, when, a, charge, is, accelerated, it, emits, synchrotron, radiation, during, a, molecular, atomic, or, nuclear, transition, to, a, lower, energy, level, photons, of, various, energy, will, be, emitted, ranging, from, radio, waves, to, gamma, rays, photons, can, also, be, emitted, when, a, particle, and, its, corresponding, antiparticle, are, annihilated, for, example, electron, positron, annihilation, 572, 1114, 1172, in, empty, space, the, photon, moves, at, c, the, speed, of, light, and, its, energy, and, momentum, are, related, by, e, pc, where, p, is, the, magnitude, of, the, momentum, vector, p, this, derives, from, the, following, relativistic, relation, with, m, 0, the, energy, and, momentum, of, a, photon, depend, only, on, its, frequency, displaystyle, nu, or, inversely, its, wavelength, where, k, is, the, wave, vector, where, since, p, displaystyle, boldsymbol, p, points, in, the, direction, of, the, photon, s, propagation, the, magnitude, of, its, momentum, is, the, photon, also, carries, spin, angular, momentum, which, is, related, to, photon, polarization, beams, of, light, also, exhibit, properties, described, as, orbital, angular, momentum, of, light, the, angular, momentum, of, the, photon, has, two, possible, values, either, or, these, two, possible, values, correspond, to, the, two, possible, pure, states, of, circular, polarization, collections, of, photons, in, a, light, beam, may, have, mixtures, of, these, two, values, a, linearly, polarized, light, beam, will, act, as, if, it, were, composed, of, equal, numbers, of, the, two, possible, angular, momenta, 325, the, spin, angular, momentum, of, light, does, not, depend, on, its, frequency, and, was, experimentally, verified, by, c, v, raman, and, s, bhagavantam, in, 1931, the, collision, of, a, particle, with, its, antiparticle, can, create, photons, in, free, space, at, least, two, photons, must, be, created, since, in, the, center, of, momentum, frame, the, colliding, antiparticles, have, no, net, momentum, whereas, a, single, photon, always, has, momentum, determined, by, the, photon, s, frequency, or, wavelength, which, cannot, be, zero, hence, conservation, of, momentum, or, equivalently, translational, invariance, requires, that, at, least, two, photons, are, created, with, zero, net, momentum, 64, 65, the, energy, of, the, two, photons, or, equivalently, their, frequency, may, be, determined, from, conservation, of, four, momentum, seen, another, way, the, photon, can, be, considered, as, its, own, antiparticle, thus, an, antiphoton, is, simply, a, normal, photon, with, opposite, momentum, equal, polarization, and, 180, out, of, phase, the, reverse, process, pair, production, is, the, dominant, mechanism, by, which, high, energy, photons, such, as, gamma, rays, lose, energy, while, passing, through, matter, that, process, is, the, reverse, of, annihilation, to, one, photon, allowed, in, the, electric, field, of, an, atomic, nucleus, the, classical, formulae, for, the, energy, and, momentum, of, electromagnetic, radiation, can, be, re, expressed, in, terms, of, photon, events, for, example, the, pressure, of, electromagnetic, radiation, on, an, object, derives, from, the, transfer, of, photon, momentum, per, unit, time, and, unit, area, to, that, object, since, pressure, is, force, per, unit, area, and, force, is, the, change, in, momentum, per, unit, time, current, commonly, accepted, physical, theories, imply, or, assume, the, photon, to, be, strictly, massless, if, photons, were, not, purely, massless, their, speeds, would, vary, with, frequency, with, lower, energy, redder, photons, moving, slightly, slower, than, higher, energy, photons, relativity, would, be, unaffected, by, this, the, so, called, speed, of, light, c, would, then, not, be, the, actual, speed, at, which, light, moves, but, a, constant, of, nature, which, is, the, upper, bound, on, speed, that, any, object, could, theoretically, attain, in, spacetime, thus, it, would, still, be, the, speed, of, spacetime, ripples, gravitational, waves, and, gravitons, but, it, would, not, be, the, speed, of, photons, if, a, photon, did, have, non, zero, mass, there, would, be, other, effects, as, well, coulomb, s, law, would, be, modified, and, the, electromagnetic, field, would, have, an, extra, physical, degree, of, freedom, these, effects, yield, more, sensitive, experimental, probes, of, the, photon, mass, than, the, frequency, dependence, of, the, speed, of, light, if, coulomb, s, law, is, not, exactly, valid, then, that, would, allow, the, presence, of, an, electric, field, to, exist, within, a, hollow, conductor, when, it, is, subjected, to, an, external, electric, field, this, provides, a, means, for, precision, tests, of, coulomb, s, law, a, null, result, of, such, an, experiment, has, set, a, limit, of, m, 10, 14, ev, c, 2, sharper, upper, limits, on, the, mass, of, light, have, been, obtained, in, experiments, designed, to, detect, effects, caused, by, the, galactic, vector, potential, although, the, galactic, vector, potential, is, large, because, the, galactic, magnetic, field, exists, on, great, length, scales, only, the, magnetic, field, would, be, observable, if, the, photon, is, massless, in, the, case, that, the, photon, has, mass, the, mass, term, 1, 2, m, 2, a, a, would, affect, the, galactic, plasma, the, fact, that, no, such, effects, are, seen, implies, an, upper, bound, on, the, photon, mass, of, m, 3, 10, 27, ev, c, 2, the, galactic, vector, potential, can, also, be, probed, directly, by, measuring, the, torque, exerted, on, a, magnetized, ring, such, methods, were, used, to, obtain, the, sharper, upper, limit, of, 1, 07, 10, 27, ev, c, 2, the, equivalent, of, 10, 36, daltons, given, by, the, particle, data, group, these, sharp, limits, from, the, non, observation, of, the, effects, caused, by, the, galactic, vector, potential, have, been, shown, to, be, model, dependent, if, the, photon, mass, is, generated, via, the, higgs, mechanism, then, the, upper, limit, of, m, 10, 14, ev, c, 2, from, the, test, of, coulomb, s, law, is, valid, in, most, theories, up, to, the, eighteenth, century, light, was, pictured, as, being, made, of, particles, since, particle, models, cannot, easily, account, for, the, refraction, diffraction, and, birefringence, of, light, wave, theories, of, light, were, proposed, by, ren, descartes, 1637, robert, hooke, 1665, and, christiaan, huygens, 1678, however, particle, models, remained, dominant, chiefly, due, to, the, influence, of, isaac, newton, in, the, early, 19th, century, thomas, young, and, august, fresnel, clearly, demonstrated, the, interference, and, diffraction, of, light, and, by, 1850, wave, models, were, generally, accepted, james, clerk, maxwell, s, 1865, prediction, that, light, was, an, electromagnetic, wave, which, was, confirmed, experimentally, in, 1888, by, heinrich, hertz, s, detection, of, radio, waves, seemed, to, be, the, final, blow, to, particle, models, of, light, the, maxwell, wave, theory, however, does, not, account, for, all, properties, of, light, the, maxwell, theory, predicts, that, the, energy, of, a, light, wave, depends, only, on, its, intensity, not, on, its, frequency, nevertheless, several, independent, types, of, experiments, show, that, the, energy, imparted, by, light, to, atoms, depends, only, on, the, light, s, frequency, not, on, its, intensity, for, example, some, chemical, reactions, are, provoked, only, by, light, of, frequency, higher, than, a, certain, threshold, light, of, frequency, lower, than, the, threshold, no, matter, how, intense, does, not, initiate, the, reaction, similarly, electrons, can, be, ejected, from, a, metal, plate, by, shining, light, of, sufficiently, high, frequency, on, it, the, photoelectric, effect, the, energy, of, the, ejected, electron, is, related, only, to, the, light, s, frequency, not, to, its, intensity, at, the, same, time, investigations, of, black, body, radiation, carried, out, over, four, decades, 1860, 1900, by, various, researchers, culminated, in, max, planck, s, hypothesis, that, the, energy, of, any, system, that, absorbs, or, emits, electromagnetic, radiation, of, frequency, is, an, integer, multiple, of, an, energy, quantum, e, h, as, shown, by, albert, einstein, some, form, of, energy, quantization, must, be, assumed, to, account, for, the, thermal, equilibrium, observed, between, matter, and, electromagnetic, radiation, for, this, explanation, of, the, photoelectric, effect, einstein, received, the, 1921, nobel, prize, in, physics, since, the, maxwell, theory, of, light, allows, for, all, possible, energies, of, electromagnetic, radiation, most, physicists, assumed, initially, that, the, energy, quantization, resulted, from, some, unknown, constraint, on, the, matter, that, absorbs, or, emits, the, radiation, in, 1905, einstein, was, the, first, to, propose, that, energy, quantization, was, a, property, of, electromagnetic, radiation, itself, although, he, accepted, the, validity, of, maxwell, s, theory, einstein, pointed, out, that, many, anomalous, experiments, could, be, explained, if, the, energy, of, a, maxwellian, light, wave, were, localized, into, point, like, quanta, that, move, independently, of, one, another, even, if, the, wave, itself, is, spread, continuously, over, space, in, 1909, and, 1916, einstein, showed, that, if, planck, s, law, regarding, black, body, radiation, is, accepted, the, energy, quanta, must, also, carry, momentum, p, h, making, them, full, fledged, particles, this, photon, momentum, was, observed, experimentally, by, arthur, compton, for, which, he, received, the, nobel, prize, in, 1927, the, pivotal, question, then, was, how, to, unify, maxwell, s, wave, theory, of, light, with, its, experimentally, observed, particle, nature, the, answer, to, this, question, occupied, albert, einstein, for, the, rest, of, his, life, and, was, solved, in, quantum, electrodynamics, and, its, successor, the, standard, model, see, quantum, field, theory, and, as, a, gauge, boson, below, einstein, s, 1905, predictions, were, verified, experimentally, in, several, ways, in, the, first, two, decades, of, the, 20th, century, as, recounted, in, robert, millikan, s, nobel, lecture, however, before, compton, s, experiment, showed, that, photons, carried, momentum, proportional, to, their, wave, number, 1922, most, physicists, were, reluctant, to, believe, that, electromagnetic, radiation, itself, might, be, particulate, see, for, example, the, nobel, lectures, of, wien, planck, and, millikan, instead, there, was, a, widespread, belief, that, energy, quantization, resulted, from, some, unknown, constraint, on, the, matter, that, absorbed, or, emitted, radiation, attitudes, changed, over, time, in, part, the, change, can, be, traced, to, experiments, such, as, those, revealing, compton, scattering, where, it, was, much, more, difficult, not, to, ascribe, quantization, to, light, itself, to, explain, the, observed, results, even, after, compton, s, experiment, niels, bohr, hendrik, kramers, and, john, slater, made, one, last, attempt, to, preserve, the, maxwellian, continuous, electromagnetic, field, model, of, light, the, so, called, bks, theory, an, important, feature, of, the, bks, theory, is, how, it, treated, the, conservation, of, energy, and, the, conservation, of, momentum, in, the, bks, theory, energy, and, momentum, are, only, conserved, on, the, average, across, many, interactions, between, matter, and, radiation, however, refined, compton, experiments, showed, that, the, conservation, laws, hold, for, individual, interactions, accordingly, bohr, and, his, co, workers, gave, their, model, as, honorable, a, funeral, as, possible, nevertheless, the, failures, of, the, bks, model, inspired, werner, heisenberg, in, his, development, of, matrix, mechanics, a, few, physicists, persisted, in, developing, semiclassical, models, in, which, electromagnetic, radiation, is, not, quantized, but, matter, appears, to, obey, the, laws, of, quantum, mechanics, although, the, evidence, from, chemical, and, physical, experiments, for, the, existence, of, photons, was, overwhelming, by, the, 1970s, this, evidence, could, not, be, considered, as, absolutely, definitive, since, it, relied, on, the, interaction, of, light, with, matter, and, a, sufficiently, complete, theory, of, matter, could, in, principle, account, for, the, evidence, nevertheless, all, semiclassical, theories, were, refuted, definitively, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, by, photon, correlation, experiments, hence, einstein, s, hypothesis, that, quantization, is, a, property, of, light, itself, is, considered, to, be, proven, photons, obey, the, laws, of, quantum, mechanics, and, so, their, behavior, has, both, wave, like, and, particle, like, aspects, when, a, photon, is, detected, by, a, measuring, instrument, it, is, registered, as, a, single, particulate, unit, however, the, probability, of, detecting, a, photon, is, calculated, by, equations, that, describe, waves, this, combination, of, aspects, is, known, as, wave, particle, duality, for, example, the, probability, distribution, for, the, location, at, which, a, photon, might, be, detected, displays, clearly, wave, like, phenomena, such, as, diffraction, and, interference, a, single, photon, passing, through, a, double, slit, has, its, energy, received, at, a, point, on, the, screen, with, a, probability, distribution, given, by, its, interference, pattern, determined, by, maxwell, s, wave, equations, however, experiments, confirm, that, the, photon, is, not, a, short, pulse, of, electromagnetic, radiation, a, photon, s, maxwell, waves, will, diffract, but, photon, energy, does, not, spread, out, as, it, propagates, nor, does, this, energy, divide, when, it, encounters, a, beam, splitter, rather, the, received, photon, acts, like, a, point, like, particle, since, it, is, absorbed, or, emitted, as, a, whole, by, arbitrarily, small, systems, including, systems, much, smaller, than, its, wavelength, such, as, an, atomic, nucleus, 10, 15, m, across, or, even, the, point, like, electron, while, many, introductory, texts, treat, photons, using, the, mathematical, techniques, of, non, relativistic, quantum, mechanics, this, is, in, some, ways, an, awkward, oversimplification, as, photons, are, by, nature, intrinsically, relativistic, because, photons, have, zero, rest, mass, no, wave, function, defined, for, a, photon, can, have, all, the, properties, familiar, from, wave, functions, in, non, relativistic, quantum, mechanics, in, order, to, avoid, these, difficulties, physicists, employ, the, second, quantized, theory, of, photons, described, below, quantum, electrodynamics, in, which, photons, are, quantized, excitations, of, electromagnetic, modes, another, difficulty, is, finding, the, proper, analogue, for, the, uncertainty, principle, an, idea, frequently, attributed, to, heisenberg, who, introduced, the, concept, in, analyzing, a, thought, experiment, involving, an, electron, and, a, high, energy, photon, however, heisenberg, did, not, give, precise, mathematical, definitions, of, what, the, uncertainty, in, these, measurements, meant, the, precise, mathematical, statement, of, the, position, momentum, uncertainty, principle, is, due, to, kennard, pauli, and, weyl, the, uncertainty, principle, applies, to, situations, where, an, experimenter, has, a, choice, of, measuring, either, one, of, two, canonically, conjugate, quantities, like, the, position, and, the, momentum, of, a, particle, according, to, the, uncertainty, principle, no, matter, how, the, particle, is, prepared, it, is, not, possible, to, make, a, precise, prediction, for, both, of, the, two, alternative, measurements, if, the, outcome, of, the, position, measurement, is, made, more, certain, the, outcome, of, the, momentum, measurement, becomes, less, so, and, vice, versa, a, coherent, state, minimizes, the, overall, uncertainty, as, far, as, quantum, mechanics, allows, quantum, optics, makes, use, of, coherent, states, for, modes, of, the, electromagnetic, field, there, is, a, tradeoff, reminiscent, of, the, position, momentum, uncertainty, relation, between, measurements, of, an, electromagnetic, wave, s, amplitude, and, its, phase, this, is, sometimes, informally, expressed, in, terms, of, the, uncertainty, in, the, number, of, photons, present, in, the, electromagnetic, wave, n, displaystyle, delta, n, and, the, uncertainty, in, the, phase, of, the, wave, displaystyle, delta, phi, however, this, cannot, be, an, uncertainty, relation, of, the, kennard, pauli, weyl, type, since, unlike, position, and, momentum, the, phase, displaystyle, phi, cannot, be, represented, by, a, hermitian, operator, in, 1924, satyendra, nath, bose, derived, planck, s, law, of, black, body, radiation, without, using, any, electromagnetism, but, rather, by, using, a, modification, of, coarse, grained, counting, of, phase, space, einstein, showed, that, this, modification, is, equivalent, to, assuming, that, photons, are, rigorously, identical, and, that, it, implied, a, mysterious, non, local, interaction, now, understood, as, the, requirement, for, a, symmetric, quantum, mechanical, state, this, work, led, to, the, concept, of, coherent, states, and, the, development, of, the, laser, in, the, same, papers, einstein, extended, bose, s, formalism, to, material, particles, bosons, and, predicted, that, they, would, condense, into, their, lowest, quantum, state, at, low, enough, temperatures, this, bose, einstein, condensation, was, observed, experimentally, in, 1995, it, was, later, used, by, lene, hau, to, slow, and, then, completely, stop, light, in, 1999, and, 2001, the, modern, view, on, this, is, that, photons, are, by, virtue, of, their, integer, spin, bosons, as, opposed, to, fermions, with, half, integer, spin, by, the, spin, statistics, theorem, all, bosons, obey, bose, einstein, statistics, whereas, all, fermions, obey, fermi, dirac, statistics, in, 1916, albert, einstein, showed, that, planck, s, radiation, law, could, be, derived, from, a, semi, classical, statistical, treatment, of, photons, and, atoms, which, implies, a, link, between, the, rates, at, which, atoms, emit, and, absorb, photons, the, condition, follows, from, the, assumption, that, functions, of, the, emission, and, absorption, of, radiation, by, the, atoms, are, independent, of, each, other, and, that, thermal, equilibrium, is, made, by, way, of, the, radiation, s, interaction, with, the, atoms, consider, a, cavity, in, thermal, equilibrium, with, all, parts, of, itself, and, filled, with, electromagnetic, radiation, and, that, the, atoms, can, emit, and, absorb, that, radiation, thermal, equilibrium, requires, that, the, energy, density, displaystyle, rho, nu, of, photons, with, frequency, displaystyle, nu, which, is, proportional, to, their, number, density, is, on, average, constant, in, time, hence, the, rate, at, which, photons, of, any, particular, frequency, are, emitted, must, equal, the, rate, at, which, they, are, absorbed, einstein, began, by, postulating, simple, proportionality, relations, for, the, different, reaction, rates, involved, in, his, model, the, rate, r, j, i, displaystyle, r, ji, for, a, system, to, absorb, a, photon, of, frequency, displaystyle, nu, and, transition, from, a, lower, energy, e, j, displaystyle, e, j, to, a, higher, energy, e, i, displaystyle, e, i, is, proportional, to, the, number, n, j, displaystyle, n, j, of, atoms, with, energy, e, j, displaystyle, e, j, and, to, the, energy, density, displaystyle, rho, nu, of, ambient, photons, of, that, frequency, where, b, j, i, displaystyle, b, ji, is, the, rate, constant, for, absorption, for, the, reverse, process, there, are, two, possibilities, spontaneous, emission, of, a, photon, or, the, emission, of, a, photon, initiated, by, the, interaction, of, the, atom, with, a, passing, photon, and, the, return, of, the, atom, to, the, lower, energy, state, following, einstein, s, approach, the, corresponding, rate, r, i, j, displaystyle, r, ij, for, the, emission, of, photons, of, frequency, displaystyle, nu, and, transition, from, a, higher, energy, e, i, displaystyle, e, i, to, a, lower, energy, e, j, displaystyle, e, j, is, where, a, i, j, displaystyle, a, ij, is, the, rate, constant, for, emitting, a, photon, spontaneously, and, b, i, j, displaystyle, b, ij, is, the, rate, constant, for, emissions, in, response, to, ambient, photons, induced, or, stimulated, emission, in, thermodynamic, equilibrium, the, number, of, atoms, in, state, i, displaystyle, i, and, those, in, state, j, displaystyle, j, must, on, average, be, constant, hence, the, rates, r, j, i, displaystyle, r, ji, and, r, i, j, displaystyle, r, ij, must, be, equal, also, by, arguments, analogous, to, the, derivation, of, boltzmann, statistics, the, ratio, of, n, i, displaystyle, n, i, and, n, j, displaystyle, n, j, is, g, i, g, j, exp, e, j, e, i, k, t, displaystyle, g, i, g, j, exp, e, j, e, i, kt, where, g, i, displaystyle, g, i, and, g, j, displaystyle, g, j, are, the, degeneracy, of, the, state, i, displaystyle, i, and, that, of, j, displaystyle, j, respectively, e, i, displaystyle, e, i, and, e, j, displaystyle, e, j, their, energies, k, displaystyle, k, the, boltzmann, constant, and, t, displaystyle, t, the, system, s, temperature, from, this, it, is, readily, derived, that, g, i, b, i, j, g, j, b, j, i, displaystyle, g, i, b, ij, g, j, b, ji, and, the, a, i, j, displaystyle, a, ij, and, b, i, j, displaystyle, b, ij, are, collectively, known, as, the, einstein, coefficients, einstein, could, not, fully, justify, his, rate, equations, but, claimed, that, it, should, be, possible, to, calculate, the, coefficients, a, i, j, displaystyle, a, ij, b, j, i, displaystyle, b, ji, and, b, i, j, displaystyle, b, ij, once, physicists, had, obtained, mechanics, and, electrodynamics, modified, to, accommodate, the, quantum, hypothesis, not, long, thereafter, in, 1926, paul, dirac, derived, the, b, i, j, displaystyle, b, ij, rate, constants, by, using, a, semiclassical, approach, and, in, 1927, succeeded, in, deriving, all, the, rate, constants, from, first, principles, within, the, framework, of, quantum, theory, dirac, s, work, was, the, foundation, of, quantum, electrodynamics, i, e, the, quantization, of, the, electromagnetic, field, itself, dirac, s, approach, is, also, called, second, quantization, or, quantum, field, theory, earlier, quantum, mechanical, treatments, only, treat, material, particles, as, quantum, mechanical, not, the, electromagnetic, field, einstein, was, troubled, by, the, fact, that, his, theory, seemed, incomplete, since, it, did, not, determine, the, direction, of, a, spontaneously, emitted, photon, a, probabilistic, nature, of, light, particle, motion, was, first, considered, by, newton, in, his, treatment, of, birefringence, and, more, generally, of, the, splitting, of, light, beams, at, interfaces, into, a, transmitted, beam, and, a, reflected, beam, newton, hypothesized, that, hidden, variables, in, the, light, particle, determined, which, of, the, two, paths, a, single, photon, would, take, similarly, einstein, hoped, for, a, more, complete, theory, that, would, leave, nothing, to, chance, beginning, his, separation, from, quantum, mechanics, ironically, max, born, s, probabilistic, interpretation, of, the, wave, function, was, inspired, by, einstein, s, later, work, searching, for, a, more, complete, theory, in, 1910, peter, debye, derived, planck, s, law, of, black, body, radiation, from, a, relatively, simple, assumption, he, decomposed, the, electromagnetic, field, in, a, cavity, into, its, fourier, modes, and, assumed, that, the, energy, in, any, mode, was, an, integer, multiple, of, h, displaystyle, h, nu, where, displaystyle, nu, is, the, frequency, of, the, electromagnetic, mode, planck, s, law, of, black, body, radiation, follows, immediately, as, a, geometric, sum, however, debye, s, approach, failed, to, give, the, correct, formula, for, the, energy, fluctuations, of, black, body, radiation, which, were, derived, by, einstein, in, 1909, in, 1925, born, heisenberg, and, jordan, reinterpreted, debye, s, concept, in, a, key, way, as, may, be, shown, classically, the, fourier, modes, of, the, electromagnetic, field, a, complete, set, of, electromagnetic, plane, waves, indexed, by, their, wave, vector, k, and, polarization, state, are, equivalent, to, a, set, of, uncoupled, simple, harmonic, oscillators, treated, quantum, mechanically, the, energy, levels, of, such, oscillators, are, known, to, be, e, n, h, displaystyle, e, nh, nu, where, displaystyle, nu, is, the, oscillator, frequency, the, key, new, step, was, to, identify, an, electromagnetic, mode, with, energy, e, n, h, displaystyle, e, nh, nu, as, a, state, with, n, displaystyle, n, photons, each, of, energy, h, displaystyle, h, nu, this, approach, gives, the, correct, energy, fluctuation, formula, dirac, took, this, one, step, further, he, treated, the, interaction, between, a, charge, and, an, electromagnetic, field, as, a, small, perturbation, that, induces, transitions, in, the, photon, states, changing, the, numbers, of, photons, in, the, modes, while, conserving, energy, and, momentum, overall, dirac, was, able, to, derive, einstein, s, a, i, j, displaystyle, a, ij, and, b, i, j, displaystyle, b, ij, coefficients, from, first, principles, and, showed, that, the, bose, einstein, statistics, of, photons, is, a, natural, consequence, of, quantizing, the, electromagnetic, field, correctly, bose, s, reasoning, went, in, the, opposite, direction, he, derived, planck, s, law, of, black, body, radiation, by, assuming, b, e, statistics, in, dirac, s, time, it, was, not, yet, known, that, all, bosons, including, photons, must, obey, bose, einstein, statistics, dirac, s, second, order, perturbation, theory, can, involve, virtual, photons, transient, intermediate, states, of, the, electromagnetic, field, the, static, electric, and, magnetic, interactions, are, mediated, by, such, virtual, photons, in, such, quantum, field, theories, the, probability, amplitude, of, observable, events, is, calculated, by, summing, over, all, possible, intermediate, steps, even, ones, that, are, unphysical, hence, virtual, photons, are, not, constrained, to, satisfy, e, p, c, displaystyle, e, pc, and, may, have, extra, polarization, states, depending, on, the, gauge, used, virtual, photons, may, have, three, or, four, polarization, states, instead, of, the, two, states, of, real, photons, although, these, transient, virtual, photons, can, never, be, observed, they, contribute, measurably, to, the, probabilities, of, observable, events, indeed, such, second, order, and, higher, order, perturbation, calculations, can, give, apparently, infinite, contributions, to, the, sum, such, unphysical, results, are, corrected, for, using, the, technique, of, renormalization, other, virtual, particles, may, contribute, to, the, summation, as, well, for, example, two, photons, may, interact, indirectly, through, virtual, electron, positron, pairs, such, photon, photon, scattering, see, two, photon, physics, as, well, as, electron, photon, scattering, is, meant, to, be, one, of, the, modes, of, operations, of, the, planned, particle, accelerator, the, international, linear, collider, in, modern, physics, notation, the, quantum, state, of, the, electromagnetic, field, is, written, as, a, fock, state, a, tensor, product, of, the, states, for, each, electromagnetic, mode, where, n, k, i, displaystyle, n, k, i, rangle, represents, the, state, in, which, n, k, i, displaystyle, n, k, i, photons, are, in, the, mode, k, i, displaystyle, k, i, in, this, notation, the, creation, of, a, new, photon, in, mode, k, i, displaystyle, k, i, e, g, emitted, from, an, atomic, transition, is, written, as, n, k, i, n, k, i, 1, displaystyle, n, k, i, rangle, rightarrow, n, k, i, 1, rangle, this, notation, merely, expresses, the, concept, of, born, heisenberg, and, jordan, described, above, and, does, not, add, any, physics, the, electromagnetic, field, can, be, understood, as, a, gauge, field, i, e, as, a, field, that, results, from, requiring, that, a, gauge, symmetry, holds, independently, at, every, position, in, spacetime, for, the, electromagnetic, field, this, gauge, symmetry, is, the, abelian, u, 1, symmetry, of, complex, numbers, of, absolute, value, 1, which, reflects, the, ability, to, vary, the, phase, of, a, complex, field, without, affecting, observables, or, real, valued, functions, made, from, it, such, as, the, energy, or, the, lagrangian, the, quanta, of, an, abelian, gauge, field, must, be, massless, uncharged, bosons, as, long, as, the, symmetry, is, not, broken, hence, the, photon, is, predicted, to, be, massless, and, to, have, zero, electric, charge, and, integer, spin, the, particular, form, of, the, electromagnetic, interaction, specifies, that, the, photon, must, have, spin, 1, thus, its, helicity, must, be, displaystyle, pm, hbar, these, two, spin, components, correspond, to, the, classical, concepts, of, right, handed, and, left, handed, circularly, polarized, light, however, the, transient, virtual, photons, of, quantum, electrodynamics, may, also, adopt, unphysical, polarization, states, in, the, prevailing, standard, model, of, physics, the, photon, is, one, of, four, gauge, bosons, in, the, electroweak, interaction, the, other, three, are, denoted, w, w, and, z, 0, and, are, responsible, for, the, weak, interaction, unlike, the, photon, these, gauge, bosons, have, mass, owing, to, a, mechanism, that, breaks, their, su, 2, gauge, symmetry, the, unification, of, the, photon, with, w, and, z, gauge, bosons, in, the, electroweak, interaction, was, accomplished, by, sheldon, glashow, abdus, salam, and, steven, weinberg, for, which, they, were, awarded, the, 1979, nobel, prize, in, physics, physicists, continue, to, hypothesize, grand, unified, theories, that, connect, these, four, gauge, bosons, with, the, eight, gluon, gauge, bosons, of, quantum, chromodynamics, however, key, predictions, of, these, theories, such, as, proton, decay, have, not, been, observed, experimentally, measurements, of, the, interaction, between, energetic, photons, and, hadrons, show, that, the, interaction, is, much, more, intense, than, expected, by, the, interaction, of, merely, photons, with, the, hadron, s, electric, charge, furthermore, the, interaction, of, energetic, photons, with, protons, is, similar, to, the, interaction, of, photons, with, neutrons, in, spite, of, the, fact, that, the, electric, charge, structures, of, protons, and, neutrons, are, substantially, different, a, theory, called, vector, meson, dominance, vmd, was, developed, to, explain, this, effect, according, to, vmd, the, photon, is, a, superposition, of, the, pure, electromagnetic, photon, which, interacts, only, with, electric, charges, and, vector, mesons, however, if, experimentally, probed, at, very, short, distances, the, intrinsic, structure, of, the, photon, is, recognized, as, a, flux, of, quark, and, gluon, components, quasi, free, according, to, asymptotic, freedom, in, qcd, and, described, by, the, photon, structure, function, a, comprehensive, comparison, of, data, with, theoretical, predictions, was, presented, in, a, review, in, 2000, the, energy, of, a, system, that, emits, a, photon, is, decreased, by, the, energy, e, displaystyle, e, of, the, photon, as, measured, in, the, rest, frame, of, the, emitting, system, which, may, result, in, a, reduction, in, mass, in, the, amount, e, c, 2, displaystyle, e, c, 2, similarly, the, mass, of, a, system, that, absorbs, a, photon, is, increased, by, a, corresponding, amount, as, an, application, the, energy, balance, of, nuclear, reactions, involving, photons, is, commonly, written, in, terms, of, the, masses, of, the, nuclei, involved, and, terms, of, the, form, e, c, 2, displaystyle, e, c, 2, for, the, gamma, photons, and, for, other, relevant, energies, such, as, the, recoil, energy, of, nuclei, this, concept, is, applied, in, key, predictions, of, quantum, electrodynamics, qed, see, above, in, that, theory, the, mass, of, electrons, or, more, generally, leptons, is, modified, by, including, the, mass, contributions, of, virtual, photons, in, a, technique, known, as, renormalization, such, radiative, corrections, contribute, to, a, number, of, predictions, of, qed, such, as, the, magnetic, dipole, moment, of, leptons, the, lamb, shift, and, the, hyperfine, structure, of, bound, lepton, pairs, such, as, muonium, and, positronium, since, photons, contribute, to, the, stress, energy, tensor, they, exert, a, gravitational, attraction, on, other, objects, according, to, the, theory, of, general, relativity, conversely, photons, are, themselves, affected, by, gravity, their, normally, straight, trajectories, may, be, bent, by, warped, spacetime, as, in, gravitational, lensing, and, their, frequencies, may, be, lowered, by, moving, to, a, higher, gravitational, potential, as, in, the, pound, rebka, experiment, however, these, effects, are, not, specific, to, photons, exactly, the, same, effects, would, be, predicted, for, classical, electromagnetic, waves, light, that, travels, through, transparent, matter, does, so, at, a, lower, speed, than, c, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, the, factor, by, which, the, speed, is, decreased, is, called, the, refractive, index, of, the, material, in, a, classical, wave, picture, the, slowing, can, be, explained, by, the, light, inducing, electric, polarization, in, the, matter, the, polarized, matter, radiating, new, light, and, that, new, light, interfering, with, the, original, light, wave, to, form, a, delayed, wave, in, a, particle, picture, the, slowing, can, instead, be, described, as, a, blending, of, the, photon, with, quantum, excitations, of, the, matter, to, produce, quasi, particles, known, as, polariton, see, this, list, for, some, other, quasi, particles, this, polariton, has, a, nonzero, effective, mass, which, means, that, it, cannot, travel, at, c, light, of, different, frequencies, may, travel, through, matter, at, different, speeds, this, is, called, dispersion, not, to, be, confused, with, scattering, in, some, cases, it, can, result, in, extremely, slow, speeds, of, light, in, matter, the, effects, of, photon, interactions, with, other, quasi, particles, may, be, observed, directly, in, raman, scattering, and, brillouin, scattering, photons, can, be, scattered, by, matter, for, example, photons, engage, in, so, many, collisions, on, the, way, from, the, core, of, the, sun, that, radiant, energy, can, take, about, a, million, years, to, reach, the, surface, however, once, in, open, space, a, photon, takes, only, 8, 3, minutes, to, reach, earth, photons, can, also, be, absorbed, by, nuclei, atoms, or, molecules, provoking, transitions, between, their, energy, levels, a, classic, example, is, the, molecular, transition, of, retinal, c, 20, h, 28, o, which, is, responsible, for, vision, as, discovered, in, 1958, by, nobel, laureate, biochemist, george, wald, and, co, workers, the, absorption, provokes, a, cis, trans, isomerization, that, in, combination, with, other, such, transitions, is, transduced, into, nerve, impulses, the, absorption, of, photons, can, even, break, chemical, bonds, as, in, the, photodissociation, of, chlorine, this, is, the, subject, of, photochemistry, photons, have, many, applications, in, technology, these, examples, are, chosen, to, illustrate, applications, of, photons, per, se, rather, than, general, optical, devices, such, as, lenses, etc, that, could, operate, under, a, classical, theory, of, light, the, laser, is, an, important, application, and, is, discussed, above, under, stimulated, emission, individual, photons, can, be, detected, by, several, methods, the, classic, photomultiplier, tube, exploits, the, photoelectric, effect, a, photon, of, sufficient, energy, strikes, a, metal, plate, and, knocks, free, an, electron, initiating, an, ever, amplifying, avalanche, of, electrons, semiconductor, charge, coupled, device, chips, use, a, similar, effect, an, incident, photon, generates, a, charge, on, a, microscopic, capacitor, that, can, be, detected, other, detectors, such, as, geiger, counters, use, the, ability, of, photons, to, ionize, gas, molecules, contained, in, the, device, causing, a, detectable, change, of, conductivity, of, the, gas, planck, s, energy, formula, e, h, displaystyle, e, h, nu, is, often, used, by, engineers, and, chemists, in, design, both, to, compute, the, change, in, energy, resulting, from, a, photon, absorption, and, to, determine, the, frequency, of, the, light, emitted, from, a, given, photon, emission, for, example, the, emission, spectrum, of, a, gas, discharge, lamp, can, be, altered, by, filling, it, with, mixtures, of, gases, with, different, electronic, energy, level, configurations, under, some, conditions, an, energy, transition, can, be, excited, by, two, photons, that, individually, would, be, insufficient, this, allows, for, higher, resolution, microscopy, because, the, sample, absorbs, energy, only, in, the, spectrum, where, two, beams, of, different, colors, overlap, significantly, which, can, be, made, much, smaller, than, the, excitation, volume, of, a, single, beam, see, two, photon, excitation, microscopy, moreover, these, photons, cause, less, damage, to, the, sample, since, they, are, of, lower, energy, in, some, cases, two, energy, transitions, can, be, coupled, so, that, as, one, system, absorbs, a, photon, another, nearby, system, steals, its, energy, and, re, emits, a, photon, of, a, different, frequency, this, is, the, basis, of, fluorescence, resonance, energy, transfer, a, technique, that, is, used, in, molecular, biology, to, study, the, interaction, of, suitable, proteins, several, different, kinds, of, hardware, random, number, generators, involve, the, detection, of, single, photons, in, one, example, for, each, bit, in, the, random, sequence, that, is, to, be, produced, a, photon, is, sent, to, a, beam, splitter, in, such, a, situation, there, are, two, possible, outcomes, of, equal, probability, the, actual, outcome, is, used, to, determine, whether, the, next, bit, in, the, sequence, is, 0, or, 1, much, research, has, been, devoted, to, applications, of, photons, in, the, field, of, quantum, optics, photons, seem, well, suited, to, be, elements, of, an, extremely, fast, quantum, computer, and, the, quantum, entanglement, of, photons, is, a, focus, of, research, nonlinear, optical, processes, are, another, active, research, area, with, topics, such, as, two, photon, absorption, self, phase, modulation, modulational, instability, and, optical, parametric, oscillators, however, such, processes, generally, do, not, require, the, assumption, of, photons, per, se, they, may, often, be, modeled, by, treating, atoms, as, nonlinear, oscillators, the, nonlinear, process, of, spontaneous, parametric, down, conversion, is, often, used, to, produce, single, photon, states, finally, photons, are, essential, in, some, aspects, of, optical, communication, especially, for, quantum, cryptography, two, photon, physics, studies, interactions, between, photons, which, are, rare, in, 2018, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, researchers, announced, the, discovery, of, bound, photon, triplets, which, may, involve, polaritons
