in, kinematics, the, speed, commonly, referred, to, as, v, of, an, object, is, the, magnitude, of, the, change, of, its, position, over, time, or, the, magnitude, of, the, change, of, its, position, per, unit, of, time, it, is, thus, a, scalar, quantity, the, average, speed, of, an, object, in, an, interval, of, time, is, the, distance, travelled, by, the, object, divided, by, the, duration, of, the, interval, the, instantaneous, speed, is, the, limit, of, the, average, speed, as, the, duration, of, the, time, interval, approaches, zero, speed, is, the, magnitude, of, velocity, a, vector, which, indicates, additionally, the, direction, of, motion, speed, has, the, dimensions, of, distance, divided, by, time, the, si, unit, of, speed, is, the, metre, per, second, m, s, but, the, most, common, unit, of, speed, in, everyday, usage, is, the, kilometre, per, hour, km, h, or, in, the, us, and, the, uk, miles, per, hour, mph, for, air, and, marine, travel, the, knot, is, commonly, used, the, fastest, possible, speed, at, which, energy, or, information, can, travel, according, to, special, relativity, is, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, c, 299, 792, 458, metres, per, second, approximately, 1, 079, 000, 000, km, h, or, 671, 000, 000, mph, matter, cannot, quite, reach, the, speed, of, light, as, this, would, require, an, infinite, amount, of, energy, in, relativity, physics, the, concept, of, rapidity, replaces, the, classical, idea, of, speed, italian, physicist, galileo, galilei, is, usually, credited, with, being, the, first, to, measure, speed, by, considering, the, distance, covered, and, the, time, it, takes, galileo, defined, speed, as, the, distance, covered, per, unit, of, time, in, equation, form, that, is, v, d, t, displaystyle, v, frac, d, t, where, v, displaystyle, v, is, speed, d, displaystyle, d, is, distance, and, t, displaystyle, t, is, time, a, cyclist, who, covers, 30, metres, in, a, time, of, 2, seconds, for, example, has, a, speed, of, 15, metres, per, second, objects, in, motion, often, have, variations, in, speed, a, car, might, travel, along, a, street, at, 50, km, h, slow, to, 0, km, h, and, then, reach, 30, km, h, speed, at, some, instant, or, assumed, constant, during, a, very, short, period, of, time, is, called, instantaneous, speed, by, looking, at, a, speedometer, one, can, read, the, instantaneous, speed, of, a, car, at, any, instant, a, car, travelling, at, 50, km, h, generally, goes, for, less, than, one, hour, at, a, constant, speed, but, if, it, did, go, at, that, speed, for, a, full, hour, it, would, travel, 50, km, if, the, vehicle, continued, at, that, speed, for, half, an, hour, it, would, cover, half, that, distance, 25, km, if, it, continued, for, only, one, minute, it, would, cover, about, 833, m, in, mathematical, terms, the, instantaneous, speed, v, displaystyle, v, is, defined, as, the, magnitude, of, the, instantaneous, velocity, v, displaystyle, boldsymbol, v, that, is, the, derivative, of, the, position, r, displaystyle, boldsymbol, r, with, respect, to, time, v, v, r, d, r, d, t, displaystyle, v, left, boldsymbol, v, right, left, dot, boldsymbol, r, right, left, frac, d, boldsymbol, r, dt, right, if, s, displaystyle, s, is, the, length, of, the, path, also, known, as, the, distance, travelled, until, time, t, displaystyle, t, the, speed, equals, the, time, derivative, of, s, displaystyle, s, v, d, s, d, t, displaystyle, v, frac, ds, dt, in, the, special, case, where, the, velocity, is, constant, that, is, constant, speed, in, a, straight, line, this, can, be, simplified, to, v, s, t, displaystyle, v, s, t, the, average, speed, over, a, finite, time, interval, is, the, total, distance, travelled, divided, by, the, time, duration, different, from, instantaneous, speed, average, speed, is, defined, as, the, total, distance, covered, divided, by, the, time, interval, for, example, if, a, distance, of, 80, kilometres, is, driven, in, 1, hour, the, average, speed, is, 80, kilometres, per, hour, likewise, if, 320, kilometres, are, travelled, in, 4, hours, the, average, speed, is, also, 80, kilometres, per, hour, when, a, distance, in, kilometres, km, is, divided, by, a, time, in, hours, h, the, result, is, in, kilometres, per, hour, km, h, average, speed, does, not, describe, the, speed, variations, that, may, have, taken, place, during, shorter, time, intervals, as, it, is, the, entire, distance, covered, divided, by, the, total, time, of, travel, and, so, average, speed, is, often, quite, different, from, a, value, of, instantaneous, speed, if, the, average, speed, and, the, time, of, travel, are, known, the, distance, travelled, can, be, calculated, by, rearranging, the, definition, to, d, v, t, displaystyle, d, boldsymbol, bar, v, t, using, this, equation, for, an, average, speed, of, 80, kilometres, per, hour, on, a, 4, hour, trip, the, distance, covered, is, found, to, be, 320, kilometres, expressed, in, graphical, language, the, slope, of, a, tangent, line, at, any, point, of, a, distance, time, graph, is, the, instantaneous, speed, at, this, point, while, the, slope, of, a, chord, line, of, the, same, graph, is, the, average, speed, during, the, time, interval, covered, by, the, chord, average, speed, of, an, object, is, vav, s, t, speed, denotes, only, how, fast, an, object, is, moving, whereas, velocity, describes, both, how, fast, and, in, which, direction, the, object, is, moving, if, a, car, is, said, to, travel, at, 60, km, h, its, speed, has, been, specified, however, if, the, car, is, said, to, move, at, 60, km, h, to, the, north, its, velocity, has, now, been, specified, the, big, difference, can, be, discerned, when, considering, movement, around, a, circle, when, something, moves, in, a, circular, path, and, returns, to, its, starting, point, its, average, velocity, is, zero, but, its, average, speed, is, found, by, dividing, the, circumference, of, the, circle, by, the, time, taken, to, move, around, the, circle, this, is, because, the, average, velocity, is, calculated, by, considering, only, the, displacement, between, the, starting, and, end, points, whereas, the, average, speed, considers, only, the, total, distance, travelled, units, of, speed, include, approximate, values, according, to, jean, piaget, the, intuition, for, the, notion, of, speed, in, humans, precedes, that, of, duration, and, is, based, on, the, notion, of, outdistancing, piaget, studied, this, subject, inspired, by, a, question, asked, to, him, in, 1928, by, albert, einstein, in, what, order, do, children, acquire, the, concepts, of, time, and, speed, children, s, early, concept, of, speed, is, based, on, overtaking, taking, only, temporal, and, spatial, orders, into, consideration, specifically, a, moving, object, is, judged, to, be, more, rapid, than, another, when, at, a, given, moment, the, first, object, is, behind, and, a, moment, or, so, later, ahead, of, the, other, object
