the, bit, is, the, most, basic, unit, of, information, in, computing, and, digital, communication, the, name, is, a, portmanteau, of, binary, digit, the, bit, represents, a, logical, state, with, one, of, two, possible, values, these, values, are, most, commonly, represented, as, either, 1, or, 0, but, other, representations, such, as, true, false, yes, no, on, off, or, are, also, widely, used, the, relation, between, these, values, and, the, physical, states, of, the, underlying, storage, or, device, is, a, matter, of, convention, and, different, assignments, may, be, used, even, within, the, same, device, or, program, it, may, be, physically, implemented, with, a, two, state, device, a, contiguous, group, of, binary, digits, is, commonly, called, a, bit, string, a, bit, vector, or, a, single, dimensional, or, multi, dimensional, bit, array, a, group, of, eight, bits, is, called, one, byte, but, historically, the, size, of, the, byte, is, not, strictly, defined, frequently, half, full, double, and, quadruple, words, consist, of, a, number, of, bytes, which, is, a, low, power, of, two, a, string, of, four, bits, is, usually, a, nibble, in, information, theory, one, bit, is, the, information, entropy, of, a, random, binary, variable, that, is, 0, or, 1, with, equal, probability, or, the, information, that, is, gained, when, the, value, of, such, a, variable, becomes, known, as, a, unit, of, information, the, bit, is, also, known, as, a, shannon, named, after, claude, e, shannon, the, symbol, for, the, binary, digit, is, either, bit, per, the, iec, 80000, 13, 2008, standard, or, the, lowercase, character, b, per, the, ieee, 1541, 2002, standard, use, of, the, latter, may, create, confusion, with, the, capital, b, which, is, the, international, standard, symbol, for, the, byte, the, encoding, of, data, by, discrete, bits, was, used, in, the, punched, cards, invented, by, basile, bouchon, and, jean, baptiste, falcon, 1732, developed, by, joseph, marie, jacquard, 1804, and, later, adopted, by, semyon, korsakov, charles, babbage, herman, hollerith, and, early, computer, manufacturers, like, ibm, a, variant, of, that, idea, was, the, perforated, paper, tape, in, all, those, systems, the, medium, card, or, tape, conceptually, carried, an, array, of, hole, positions, each, position, could, be, either, punched, through, or, not, thus, carrying, one, bit, of, information, the, encoding, of, text, by, bits, was, also, used, in, morse, code, 1844, and, early, digital, communications, machines, such, as, teletypes, and, stock, ticker, machines, 1870, ralph, hartley, suggested, the, use, of, a, logarithmic, measure, of, information, in, 1928, claude, e, shannon, first, used, the, word, bit, in, his, seminal, 1948, paper, a, mathematical, theory, of, communication, he, attributed, its, origin, to, john, w, tukey, who, had, written, a, bell, labs, memo, on, 9, january, 1947, in, which, he, contracted, binary, information, digit, to, simply, bit, a, bit, can, be, stored, by, a, digital, device, or, other, physical, system, that, exists, in, either, of, two, possible, distinct, states, these, may, be, the, two, stable, states, of, a, flip, flop, two, positions, of, an, electrical, switch, two, distinct, voltage, or, current, levels, allowed, by, a, circuit, two, distinct, levels, of, light, intensity, two, directions, of, magnetization, or, polarization, the, orientation, of, reversible, double, stranded, dna, etc, bits, can, be, implemented, in, several, forms, in, most, modern, computing, devices, a, bit, is, usually, represented, by, an, electrical, voltage, or, current, pulse, or, by, the, electrical, state, of, a, flip, flop, circuit, for, devices, using, positive, logic, a, digit, value, of, 1, or, a, logical, value, of, true, is, represented, by, a, more, positive, voltage, relative, to, the, representation, of, 0, different, logic, families, require, different, voltages, and, variations, are, allowed, to, account, for, component, aging, and, noise, immunity, for, example, in, transistor, transistor, logic, ttl, and, compatible, circuits, digit, values, 0, and, 1, at, the, output, of, a, device, are, represented, by, no, higher, than, 0, 4, volts, and, no, lower, than, 2, 6, volts, respectively, while, ttl, inputs, are, specified, to, recognize, 0, 8, volts, or, below, as, 0, and, 2, 2, volts, or, above, as, 1, bits, are, transmitted, one, at, a, time, in, serial, transmission, and, by, a, multiple, number, of, bits, in, parallel, transmission, a, bitwise, operation, optionally, processes, bits, one, at, a, time, data, transfer, rates, are, usually, measured, in, decimal, si, multiples, of, the, unit, bit, per, second, bit, s, such, as, kbit, s, in, the, earliest, non, electronic, information, processing, devices, such, as, jacquard, s, loom, or, babbage, s, analytical, engine, a, bit, was, often, stored, as, the, position, of, a, mechanical, lever, or, gear, or, the, presence, or, absence, of, a, hole, at, a, specific, point, of, a, paper, card, or, tape, the, first, electrical, devices, for, discrete, logic, such, as, elevator, and, traffic, light, control, circuits, telephone, switches, and, konrad, zuse, s, computer, represented, bits, as, the, states, of, electrical, relays, which, could, be, either, open, or, closed, when, relays, were, replaced, by, vacuum, tubes, starting, in, the, 1940s, computer, builders, experimented, with, a, variety, of, storage, methods, such, as, pressure, pulses, traveling, down, a, mercury, delay, line, charges, stored, on, the, inside, surface, of, a, cathode, ray, tube, or, opaque, spots, printed, on, glass, discs, by, photolithographic, techniques, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, these, methods, were, largely, supplanted, by, magnetic, storage, devices, such, as, magnetic, core, memory, magnetic, tapes, drums, and, disks, where, a, bit, was, represented, by, the, polarity, of, magnetization, of, a, certain, area, of, a, ferromagnetic, film, or, by, a, change, in, polarity, from, one, direction, to, the, other, the, same, principle, was, later, used, in, the, magnetic, bubble, memory, developed, in, the, 1980s, and, is, still, found, in, various, magnetic, strip, items, such, as, metro, tickets, and, some, credit, cards, in, modern, semiconductor, memory, such, as, dynamic, random, access, memory, the, two, values, of, a, bit, may, be, represented, by, two, levels, of, electric, charge, stored, in, a, capacitor, in, certain, types, of, programmable, logic, arrays, and, read, only, memory, a, bit, may, be, represented, by, the, presence, or, absence, of, a, conducting, path, at, a, certain, point, of, a, circuit, in, optical, discs, a, bit, is, encoded, as, the, presence, or, absence, of, a, microscopic, pit, on, a, reflective, surface, in, one, dimensional, bar, codes, bits, are, encoded, as, the, thickness, of, alternating, black, and, white, lines, the, bit, is, not, defined, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, however, the, international, electrotechnical, commission, issued, standard, iec, 60027, which, specifies, that, the, symbol, for, binary, digit, should, be, bit, and, this, should, be, used, in, all, multiples, such, as, kbit, for, kilobit, however, the, lower, case, letter, b, is, widely, used, as, well, and, was, recommended, by, the, ieee, 1541, standard, 2002, in, contrast, the, upper, case, letter, b, is, the, standard, and, customary, symbol, for, byte, multiple, bits, may, be, expressed, and, represented, in, several, ways, for, convenience, of, representing, commonly, reoccurring, groups, of, bits, in, information, technology, several, units, of, information, have, traditionally, been, used, the, most, common, is, the, unit, byte, coined, by, werner, buchholz, in, june, 1956, which, historically, was, used, to, represent, the, group, of, bits, used, to, encode, a, single, character, of, text, until, utf, 8, multibyte, encoding, took, over, in, a, computer, and, for, this, reason, it, was, used, as, the, basic, addressable, element, in, many, computer, architectures, the, trend, in, hardware, design, converged, on, the, most, common, implementation, of, using, eight, bits, per, byte, as, it, is, widely, used, today, however, because, of, the, ambiguity, of, relying, on, the, underlying, hardware, design, the, unit, octet, was, defined, to, explicitly, denote, a, sequence, of, eight, bits, computers, usually, manipulate, bits, in, groups, of, a, fixed, size, conventionally, named, words, like, the, byte, the, number, of, bits, in, a, word, also, varies, with, the, hardware, design, and, is, typically, between, 8, and, 80, bits, or, even, more, in, some, specialized, computers, in, the, 21st, century, retail, personal, or, server, computers, have, a, word, size, of, 32, or, 64, bits, the, international, system, of, units, defines, a, series, of, decimal, prefixes, for, multiples, of, standardized, units, which, are, commonly, also, used, with, the, bit, and, the, byte, the, prefixes, kilo, 10, 3, through, yotta, 10, 24, increment, by, multiples, of, one, thousand, and, the, corresponding, units, are, the, kilobit, kbit, through, the, yottabit, ybit, when, the, information, capacity, of, a, storage, system, or, a, communication, channel, is, presented, in, bits, or, bits, per, second, this, often, refers, to, binary, digits, which, is, a, computer, hardware, capacity, to, store, binary, data, 0, or, 1, up, or, down, current, or, not, etc, information, capacity, of, a, storage, system, is, only, an, upper, bound, to, the, quantity, of, information, stored, therein, if, the, two, possible, values, of, one, bit, of, storage, are, not, equally, likely, that, bit, of, storage, contains, less, than, one, bit, of, information, if, the, value, is, completely, predictable, then, the, reading, of, that, value, provides, no, information, at, all, zero, entropic, bits, because, no, resolution, of, uncertainty, occurs, and, therefore, no, information, is, available, if, a, computer, file, that, uses, n, bits, of, storage, contains, only, m, n, bits, of, information, then, that, information, can, in, principle, be, encoded, in, about, m, bits, at, least, on, the, average, this, principle, is, the, basis, of, data, compression, technology, using, an, analogy, the, hardware, binary, digits, refer, to, the, amount, of, storage, space, available, like, the, number, of, buckets, available, to, store, things, and, the, information, content, the, filling, which, comes, in, different, levels, of, granularity, fine, or, coarse, that, is, compressed, or, uncompressed, information, when, the, granularity, is, finer, when, information, is, more, compressed, the, same, bucket, can, hold, more, for, example, it, is, estimated, that, the, combined, technological, capacity, of, the, world, to, store, information, provides, 1, 300, exabytes, of, hardware, digits, however, when, this, storage, space, is, filled, and, the, corresponding, content, is, optimally, compressed, this, only, represents, 295, exabytes, of, information, when, optimally, compressed, the, resulting, carrying, capacity, approaches, shannon, information, or, information, entropy, certain, bitwise, computer, processor, instructions, such, as, bit, set, operate, at, the, level, of, manipulating, bits, rather, than, manipulating, data, interpreted, as, an, aggregate, of, bits, in, the, 1980s, when, bitmapped, computer, displays, became, popular, some, computers, provided, specialized, bit, block, transfer, instructions, to, set, or, copy, the, bits, that, corresponded, to, a, given, rectangular, area, on, the, screen, in, most, computers, and, programming, languages, when, a, bit, within, a, group, of, bits, such, as, a, byte, or, word, is, referred, to, it, is, usually, specified, by, a, number, from, 0, upwards, corresponding, to, its, position, within, the, byte, or, word, however, 0, can, refer, to, either, the, most, or, least, significant, bit, depending, on, the, context, similar, to, torque, and, energy, in, physics, information, theoretic, information, and, data, storage, size, have, the, same, dimensionality, of, units, of, measurement, but, there, is, in, general, no, meaning, to, adding, subtracting, or, otherwise, combining, the, units, mathematically, although, one, may, act, as, a, bound, on, the, other, units, of, information, used, in, information, theory, include, the, shannon, sh, the, natural, unit, of, information, nat, and, the, hartley, hart, one, shannon, is, the, maximum, amount, of, information, needed, to, specify, the, state, of, one, bit, of, storage, these, are, related, by, 1, sh, 0, 693, nat, 0, 301, hart, some, authors, also, define, a, binit, as, an, arbitrary, information, unit, equivalent, to, some, fixed, but, unspecified, number, of, bits
