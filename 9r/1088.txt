acoustics, is, a, branch, of, physics, that, deals, with, the, study, of, mechanical, waves, in, gases, liquids, and, solids, including, topics, such, as, vibration, sound, ultrasound, and, infrasound, a, scientist, who, works, in, the, field, of, acoustics, is, an, acoustician, while, someone, working, in, the, field, of, acoustics, technology, may, be, called, an, acoustical, engineer, the, application, of, acoustics, is, present, in, almost, all, aspects, of, modern, society, with, the, most, obvious, being, the, audio, and, noise, control, industries, hearing, is, one, of, the, most, crucial, means, of, survival, in, the, animal, world, and, speech, is, one, of, the, most, distinctive, characteristics, of, human, development, and, culture, accordingly, the, science, of, acoustics, spreads, across, many, facets, of, human, society, music, medicine, architecture, industrial, production, warfare, and, more, likewise, animal, species, such, as, songbirds, and, frogs, use, sound, and, hearing, as, a, key, element, of, mating, rituals, or, for, marking, territories, art, craft, science, and, technology, have, provoked, one, another, to, advance, the, whole, as, in, many, other, fields, of, knowledge, robert, bruce, lindsay, s, wheel, of, acoustics, is, a, well, accepted, overview, of, the, various, fields, in, acoustics, the, word, acoustic, is, derived, from, the, greek, word, akoustikos, meaning, of, or, for, hearing, ready, to, hear, and, that, from, akoustos, heard, audible, which, in, turn, derives, from, the, verb, akouo, i, hear, the, latin, synonym, is, sonic, after, which, the, term, sonics, used, to, be, a, synonym, for, acoustics, and, later, a, branch, of, acoustics, frequencies, above, and, below, the, audible, range, are, called, ultrasonic, and, infrasonic, respectively, in, the, 6th, century, bc, the, ancient, greek, philosopher, pythagoras, wanted, to, know, why, some, combinations, of, musical, sounds, seemed, more, beautiful, than, others, and, he, found, answers, in, terms, of, numerical, ratios, representing, the, harmonic, overtone, series, on, a, string, he, is, reputed, to, have, observed, that, when, the, lengths, of, vibrating, strings, are, expressible, as, ratios, of, integers, e, g, 2, to, 3, 3, to, 4, the, tones, produced, will, be, harmonious, and, the, smaller, the, integers, the, more, harmonious, the, sounds, for, example, a, string, of, a, certain, length, would, sound, particularly, harmonious, with, a, string, of, twice, the, length, other, factors, being, equal, in, modern, parlance, if, a, string, sounds, the, note, c, when, plucked, a, string, twice, as, long, will, sound, a, c, an, octave, lower, in, one, system, of, musical, tuning, the, tones, in, between, are, then, given, by, 16, 9, for, d, 8, 5, for, e, 3, 2, for, f, 4, 3, for, g, 6, 5, for, a, and, 16, 15, for, b, in, ascending, order, aristotle, 384, 322, bc, understood, that, sound, consisted, of, compressions, and, rarefactions, of, air, which, falls, upon, and, strikes, the, air, which, is, next, to, it, a, very, good, expression, of, the, nature, of, wave, motion, on, things, heard, generally, ascribed, to, strato, of, lampsacus, states, that, the, pitch, is, related, to, the, frequency, of, vibrations, of, the, air, and, to, the, speed, of, sound, in, about, 20, bc, the, roman, architect, and, engineer, vitruvius, wrote, a, treatise, on, the, acoustic, properties, of, theaters, including, discussion, of, interference, echoes, and, reverberation, the, beginnings, of, architectural, acoustics, in, book, v, of, his, de, architectura, the, ten, books, of, architecture, vitruvius, describes, sound, as, a, wave, comparable, to, a, water, wave, extended, to, three, dimensions, which, when, interrupted, by, obstructions, would, flow, back, and, break, up, following, waves, he, described, the, ascending, seats, in, ancient, theaters, as, designed, to, prevent, this, deterioration, of, sound, and, also, recommended, bronze, vessels, echea, of, appropriate, sizes, be, placed, in, theaters, to, resonate, with, the, fourth, fifth, and, so, on, up, to, the, double, octave, in, order, to, resonate, with, the, more, desirable, harmonious, notes, during, the, islamic, golden, age, ab, rayh, n, al, b, r, n, 973, 1048, is, believed, to, have, postulated, that, the, speed, of, sound, was, much, slower, than, the, speed, of, light, the, physical, understanding, of, acoustical, processes, advanced, rapidly, during, and, after, the, scientific, revolution, mainly, galileo, galilei, 1564, 1642, but, also, marin, mersenne, 1588, 1648, independently, discovered, the, complete, laws, of, vibrating, strings, completing, what, pythagoras, and, pythagoreans, had, started, 2000, years, earlier, galileo, wrote, waves, are, produced, by, the, vibrations, of, a, sonorous, body, which, spread, through, the, air, bringing, to, the, tympanum, of, the, ear, a, stimulus, which, the, mind, interprets, as, sound, a, remarkable, statement, that, points, to, the, beginnings, of, physiological, and, psychological, acoustics, experimental, measurements, of, the, speed, of, sound, in, air, were, carried, out, successfully, between, 1630, and, 1680, by, a, number, of, investigators, prominently, mersenne, meanwhile, newton, 1642, 1727, derived, the, relationship, for, wave, velocity, in, solids, a, cornerstone, of, physical, acoustics, principia, 1687, substantial, progress, in, acoustics, resting, on, firmer, mathematical, and, physical, concepts, was, made, during, the, eighteenth, century, by, euler, 1707, 1783, lagrange, 1736, 1813, and, d, alembert, 1717, 1783, during, this, era, continuum, physics, or, field, theory, began, to, receive, a, definite, mathematical, structure, the, wave, equation, emerged, in, a, number, of, contexts, including, the, propagation, of, sound, in, air, in, the, nineteenth, century, the, major, figures, of, mathematical, acoustics, were, helmholtz, in, germany, who, consolidated, the, field, of, physiological, acoustics, and, lord, rayleigh, in, england, who, combined, the, previous, knowledge, with, his, own, copious, contributions, to, the, field, in, his, monumental, work, the, theory, of, sound, 1877, also, in, the, 19th, century, wheatstone, ohm, and, henry, developed, the, analogy, between, electricity, and, acoustics, the, twentieth, century, saw, a, burgeoning, of, technological, applications, of, the, large, body, of, scientific, knowledge, that, was, by, then, in, place, the, first, such, application, was, sabine, s, groundbreaking, work, in, architectural, acoustics, and, many, others, followed, underwater, acoustics, was, used, for, detecting, submarines, in, the, first, world, war, sound, recording, and, the, telephone, played, important, roles, in, a, global, transformation, of, society, sound, measurement, and, analysis, reached, new, levels, of, accuracy, and, sophistication, through, the, use, of, electronics, and, computing, the, ultrasonic, frequency, range, enabled, wholly, new, kinds, of, application, in, medicine, and, industry, new, kinds, of, transducers, generators, and, receivers, of, acoustic, energy, were, invented, and, put, to, use, acoustics, is, defined, by, ansi, asa, s1, 1, 2013, as, a, science, of, sound, including, its, production, transmission, and, effects, including, biological, and, psychological, effects, b, those, qualities, of, a, room, that, together, determine, its, character, with, respect, to, auditory, effects, the, study, of, acoustics, revolves, around, the, generation, propagation, and, reception, of, mechanical, waves, and, vibrations, the, steps, shown, in, the, above, diagram, can, be, found, in, any, acoustical, event, or, process, there, are, many, kinds, of, cause, both, natural, and, volitional, there, are, many, kinds, of, transduction, process, that, convert, energy, from, some, other, form, into, sonic, energy, producing, a, sound, wave, there, is, one, fundamental, equation, that, describes, sound, wave, propagation, the, acoustic, wave, equation, but, the, phenomena, that, emerge, from, it, are, varied, and, often, complex, the, wave, carries, energy, throughout, the, propagating, medium, eventually, this, energy, is, transduced, again, into, other, forms, in, ways, that, again, may, be, natural, and, or, volitionally, contrived, the, final, effect, may, be, purely, physical, or, it, may, reach, far, into, the, biological, or, volitional, domains, the, five, basic, steps, are, found, equally, well, whether, we, are, talking, about, an, earthquake, a, submarine, using, sonar, to, locate, its, foe, or, a, band, playing, in, a, rock, concert, the, central, stage, in, the, acoustical, process, is, wave, propagation, this, falls, within, the, domain, of, physical, acoustics, in, fluids, sound, propagates, primarily, as, a, pressure, wave, in, solids, mechanical, waves, can, take, many, forms, including, longitudinal, waves, transverse, waves, and, surface, waves, acoustics, looks, first, at, the, pressure, levels, and, frequencies, in, the, sound, wave, and, how, the, wave, interacts, with, the, environment, this, interaction, can, be, described, as, either, a, diffraction, interference, or, a, reflection, or, a, mix, of, the, three, if, several, media, are, present, a, refraction, can, also, occur, transduction, processes, are, also, of, special, importance, to, acoustics, in, fluids, such, as, air, and, water, sound, waves, propagate, as, disturbances, in, the, ambient, pressure, level, while, this, disturbance, is, usually, small, it, is, still, noticeable, to, the, human, ear, the, smallest, sound, that, a, person, can, hear, known, as, the, threshold, of, hearing, is, nine, orders, of, magnitude, smaller, than, the, ambient, pressure, the, loudness, of, these, disturbances, is, related, to, the, sound, pressure, level, spl, which, is, measured, on, a, logarithmic, scale, in, decibels, physicists, and, acoustic, engineers, tend, to, discuss, sound, pressure, levels, in, terms, of, frequencies, partly, because, this, is, how, our, ears, interpret, sound, what, we, experience, as, higher, pitched, or, lower, pitched, sounds, are, pressure, vibrations, having, a, higher, or, lower, number, of, cycles, per, second, in, a, common, technique, of, acoustic, measurement, acoustic, signals, are, sampled, in, time, and, then, presented, in, more, meaningful, forms, such, as, octave, bands, or, time, frequency, plots, both, of, these, popular, methods, are, used, to, analyze, sound, and, better, understand, the, acoustic, phenomenon, the, entire, spectrum, can, be, divided, into, three, sections, audio, ultrasonic, and, infrasonic, the, audio, range, falls, between, 20, hz, and, 20, 000, hz, this, range, is, important, because, its, frequencies, can, be, detected, by, the, human, ear, this, range, has, a, number, of, applications, including, speech, communication, and, music, the, ultrasonic, range, refers, to, the, very, high, frequencies, 20, 000, hz, and, higher, this, range, has, shorter, wavelengths, which, allow, better, resolution, in, imaging, technologies, medical, applications, such, as, ultrasonography, and, elastography, rely, on, the, ultrasonic, frequency, range, on, the, other, end, of, the, spectrum, the, lowest, frequencies, are, known, as, the, infrasonic, range, these, frequencies, can, be, used, to, study, geological, phenomena, such, as, earthquakes, analytic, instruments, such, as, the, spectrum, analyzer, facilitate, visualization, and, measurement, of, acoustic, signals, and, their, properties, the, spectrogram, produced, by, such, an, instrument, is, a, graphical, display, of, the, time, varying, pressure, level, and, frequency, profiles, which, give, a, specific, acoustic, signal, its, defining, character, a, transducer, is, a, device, for, converting, one, form, of, energy, into, another, in, an, electroacoustic, context, this, means, converting, sound, energy, into, electrical, energy, or, vice, versa, electroacoustic, transducers, include, loudspeakers, microphones, particle, velocity, sensors, hydrophones, and, sonar, projectors, these, devices, convert, a, sound, wave, to, or, from, an, electric, signal, the, most, widely, used, transduction, principles, are, electromagnetism, electrostatics, and, piezoelectricity, the, transducers, in, most, common, loudspeakers, e, g, woofers, and, tweeters, are, electromagnetic, devices, that, generate, waves, using, a, suspended, diaphragm, driven, by, an, electromagnetic, voice, coil, sending, off, pressure, waves, electret, microphones, and, condenser, microphones, employ, electrostatics, as, the, sound, wave, strikes, the, microphone, s, diaphragm, it, moves, and, induces, a, voltage, change, the, ultrasonic, systems, used, in, medical, ultrasonography, employ, piezoelectric, transducers, these, are, made, from, special, ceramics, in, which, mechanical, vibrations, and, electrical, fields, are, interlinked, through, a, property, of, the, material, itself, an, acoustician, is, an, expert, in, the, science, of, sound, there, are, many, types, of, acoustician, but, they, usually, have, a, bachelor, s, degree, or, higher, qualification, some, possess, a, degree, in, acoustics, while, others, enter, the, discipline, via, studies, in, fields, such, as, physics, or, engineering, much, work, in, acoustics, requires, a, good, grounding, in, mathematics, and, science, many, acoustic, scientists, work, in, research, and, development, some, conduct, basic, research, to, advance, our, knowledge, of, the, perception, e, g, hearing, psychoacoustics, or, neurophysiology, of, speech, music, and, noise, other, acoustic, scientists, advance, understanding, of, how, sound, is, affected, as, it, moves, through, environments, e, g, underwater, acoustics, architectural, acoustics, or, structural, acoustics, other, areas, of, work, are, listed, under, subdisciplines, below, acoustic, scientists, work, in, government, university, and, private, industry, laboratories, many, go, on, to, work, in, acoustical, engineering, some, positions, such, as, faculty, academic, staff, require, a, doctor, of, philosophy, archaeoacoustics, also, known, as, the, archaeology, of, sound, is, one, of, the, only, ways, to, experience, the, past, with, senses, other, than, our, eyes, archaeoacoustics, is, studied, by, testing, the, acoustic, properties, of, prehistoric, sites, including, caves, iegor, rezkinoff, a, sound, archaeologist, studies, the, acoustic, properties, of, caves, through, natural, sounds, like, humming, and, whistling, archaeological, theories, of, acoustics, are, focused, around, ritualistic, purposes, as, well, as, a, way, of, echolocation, in, the, caves, in, archaeology, acoustic, sounds, and, rituals, directly, correlate, as, specific, sounds, were, meant, to, bring, ritual, participants, closer, to, a, spiritual, awakening, parallels, can, also, be, drawn, between, cave, wall, paintings, and, the, acoustic, properties, of, the, cave, they, are, both, dynamic, because, archaeoacoustics, is, a, fairly, new, archaeological, subject, acoustic, sound, is, still, being, tested, in, these, prehistoric, sites, today, aeroacoustics, is, the, study, of, noise, generated, by, air, movement, for, instance, via, turbulence, and, the, movement, of, sound, through, the, fluid, air, this, knowledge, is, applied, in, acoustical, engineering, to, study, how, to, quieten, aircraft, aeroacoustics, is, important, for, understanding, how, wind, musical, instruments, work, acoustic, signal, processing, is, the, electronic, manipulation, of, acoustic, signals, applications, include, active, noise, control, design, for, hearing, aids, or, cochlear, implants, echo, cancellation, music, information, retrieval, and, perceptual, coding, e, g, mp3, or, opus, architectural, acoustics, also, known, as, building, acoustics, involves, the, scientific, understanding, of, how, to, achieve, good, sound, within, a, building, it, typically, involves, the, study, of, speech, intelligibility, speech, privacy, music, quality, and, vibration, reduction, in, the, built, environment, commonly, studied, environments, are, hospitals, classrooms, dwellings, performance, venues, recording, and, broadcasting, studios, focus, considerations, include, room, acoustics, airborne, and, impact, transmission, in, building, structures, airborne, and, structure, borne, noise, control, noise, control, of, building, systems, and, electroacoustic, systems, bioacoustics, is, the, scientific, study, of, the, hearing, and, calls, of, animal, calls, as, well, as, how, animals, are, affected, by, the, acoustic, and, sounds, of, their, habitat, this, subdiscipline, is, concerned, with, the, recording, manipulation, and, reproduction, of, audio, using, electronics, this, might, include, products, such, as, mobile, phones, large, scale, public, address, systems, or, virtual, reality, systems, in, research, laboratories, environmental, acoustics, is, concerned, with, noise, and, vibration, caused, by, railways, road, traffic, aircraft, industrial, equipment, and, recreational, activities, the, main, aim, of, these, studies, is, to, reduce, levels, of, environmental, noise, and, vibration, research, work, now, also, has, a, focus, on, the, positive, use, of, sound, in, urban, environments, soundscapes, and, tranquility, musical, acoustics, is, the, study, of, the, physics, of, acoustic, instruments, the, audio, signal, processing, used, in, electronic, music, the, computer, analysis, of, music, and, composition, and, the, perception, and, cognitive, neuroscience, of, music, the, goal, this, acoustics, sub, discipline, is, to, reduce, the, impact, of, unwanted, sound, scope, of, noise, studies, includes, the, generation, propagation, and, impact, on, structures, objects, and, people, noise, research, investigates, the, impact, of, noise, on, humans, and, animals, to, include, work, in, definitions, abatement, transportation, noise, hearing, protection, jet, and, rocket, noise, building, system, noise, and, vibration, atmospheric, sound, propagation, soundscapes, and, low, frequency, sound, many, studies, have, been, conducted, to, identify, the, relationship, between, acoustics, and, cognition, or, more, commonly, known, as, psychoacoustics, in, which, what, one, hears, is, a, combination, of, perception, and, biological, aspects, the, information, intercepted, by, the, passage, of, sound, waves, through, the, ear, is, understood, and, interpreted, through, the, brain, emphasizing, the, connection, between, the, mind, and, acoustics, psychological, changes, have, been, seen, as, brain, waves, slow, down, or, speed, up, as, a, result, of, varying, auditory, stimulus, which, can, in, turn, affect, the, way, one, thinks, feels, or, even, behaves, this, correlation, can, be, viewed, in, normal, everyday, situations, in, which, listening, to, an, upbeat, or, uptempo, song, can, cause, one, s, foot, to, start, tapping, or, a, slower, song, can, leave, one, feeling, calm, and, serene, in, a, deeper, biological, look, at, the, phenomenon, of, psychoacoustics, it, was, discovered, that, the, central, nervous, system, is, activated, by, basic, acoustical, characteristics, of, music, by, observing, how, the, central, nervous, system, which, includes, the, brain, and, spine, is, influenced, by, acoustics, the, pathway, in, which, acoustic, affects, the, mind, and, essentially, the, body, is, evident, acousticians, study, the, production, processing, and, perception, of, speech, speech, recognition, and, speech, synthesis, are, two, important, areas, of, speech, processing, using, computers, the, subject, also, overlaps, with, the, disciplines, of, physics, physiology, psychology, and, linguistics, structural, acoustics, is, the, study, of, motions, and, interactions, of, mechanical, systems, with, their, environments, and, the, methods, of, their, measurement, analysis, and, control, there, are, several, sub, disciplines, found, within, this, regime, applications, might, include, ground, vibrations, from, railways, vibration, isolation, to, reduce, vibration, in, operating, theatres, studying, how, vibration, can, damage, health, vibration, white, finger, vibration, control, to,
