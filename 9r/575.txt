quartz, is, a, hard, crystalline, mineral, composed, of, silica, silicon, dioxide, the, atoms, are, linked, in, a, continuous, framework, of, sio, 4, silicon, oxygen, tetrahedra, with, each, oxygen, being, shared, between, two, tetrahedra, giving, an, overall, chemical, formula, of, sio, 2, quartz, is, therefore, classified, structurally, as, a, framework, silicate, mineral, and, compositionally, as, an, oxide, mineral, quartz, is, the, second, most, abundant, mineral, in, earth, s, continental, crust, behind, feldspar, quartz, exists, in, two, forms, the, normal, quartz, and, the, high, temperature, quartz, both, of, which, are, chiral, the, transformation, from, quartz, to, quartz, takes, place, abruptly, at, 573, c, 846, k, 1, 063, f, since, the, transformation, is, accompanied, by, a, significant, change, in, volume, it, can, easily, induce, microfracturing, of, ceramics, or, rocks, passing, through, this, temperature, threshold, there, are, many, different, varieties, of, quartz, several, of, which, are, classified, as, gemstones, since, antiquity, varieties, of, quartz, have, been, the, most, commonly, used, minerals, in, the, making, of, jewelry, and, hardstone, carvings, especially, in, europe, and, asia, quartz, is, the, mineral, defining, the, value, of, 7, on, the, mohs, scale, of, hardness, a, qualitative, scratch, method, for, determining, the, hardness, of, a, material, to, abrasion, the, word, quartz, is, derived, from, the, german, word, quarz, which, had, the, same, form, in, the, first, half, of, the, 14th, century, in, middle, high, german, and, in, east, central, german, and, which, came, from, the, polish, dialect, term, kwardy, which, corresponds, to, the, czech, term, tvrd, hard, some, sources, however, attribute, the, word, s, origin, to, the, saxon, word, querkluftertz, meaning, cross, vein, ore, the, ancient, greeks, referred, to, quartz, as, krustallos, derived, from, the, ancient, greek, kruos, meaning, icy, cold, because, some, philosophers, including, theophrastus, understood, the, mineral, to, be, a, form, of, supercooled, ice, today, the, term, rock, crystal, is, sometimes, used, as, an, alternative, name, for, transparent, coarsely, crystalline, quartz, roman, naturalist, pliny, the, elder, believed, quartz, to, be, water, ice, permanently, frozen, after, great, lengths, of, time, he, supported, this, idea, by, saying, that, quartz, is, found, near, glaciers, in, the, alps, but, not, on, volcanic, mountains, and, that, large, quartz, crystals, were, fashioned, into, spheres, to, cool, the, hands, this, idea, persisted, until, at, least, the, 17th, century, he, also, knew, of, the, ability, of, quartz, to, split, light, into, a, spectrum, in, the, 17th, century, nicolas, steno, s, study, of, quartz, paved, the, way, for, modern, crystallography, he, discovered, that, regardless, of, a, quartz, crystal, s, size, or, shape, its, long, prism, faces, always, joined, at, a, perfect, 60, angle, quartz, belongs, to, the, trigonal, crystal, system, at, room, temperature, and, to, the, hexagonal, crystal, system, above, 573, c, 846, k, 1, 063, f, the, ideal, crystal, shape, is, a, six, sided, prism, terminating, with, six, sided, pyramid, like, rhombohedrons, at, each, end, in, nature, quartz, crystals, are, often, twinned, with, twin, right, handed, and, left, handed, quartz, crystals, distorted, or, so, intergrown, with, adjacent, crystals, of, quartz, or, other, minerals, as, to, only, show, part, of, this, shape, or, to, lack, obvious, crystal, faces, altogether, and, appear, massive, well, formed, crystals, typically, form, as, a, druse, a, layer, of, crystals, lining, a, void, of, which, quartz, geodes, are, particularly, fine, examples, the, crystals, are, attached, at, one, end, to, the, enclosing, rock, and, only, one, termination, pyramid, is, present, however, doubly, terminated, crystals, do, occur, where, they, develop, freely, without, attachment, for, instance, within, gypsum, quartz, crystallizes, in, the, trigonal, crystal, system, space, group, p, 3, 1, 21, or, p, 3, 2, 21, space, group, 152, or, 154, resp, depending, on, the, chirality, above, 573, c, 846, k, 1, 063, f, quartz, in, p, 3, 1, 21, becomes, the, more, symmetric, hexagonal, p, 6, 4, 22, space, group, 181, and, quartz, in, p, 3, 2, 21, goes, to, space, group, p, 6, 2, 22, no, 180, these, space, groups, are, truly, chiral, they, each, belong, to, the, 11, enantiomorphous, pairs, both, quartz, and, quartz, are, examples, of, chiral, crystal, structures, composed, of, achiral, building, blocks, sio, 4, tetrahedra, in, the, present, case, the, transformation, between, and, quartz, only, involves, a, comparatively, minor, rotation, of, the, tetrahedra, with, respect, to, one, another, without, a, change, in, the, way, they, are, linked, however, there, is, a, significant, change, in, volume, during, this, transition, and, this, can, result, in, significant, microfracturing, in, ceramics, during, firing, in, ornamental, stone, after, a, fire, and, in, rocks, of, the, earth, s, crust, exposed, to, high, temperatures, thereby, damaging, materials, containing, quartz, and, degrading, their, physical, and, mechanical, properties, although, many, of, the, varietal, names, historically, arose, from, the, color, of, the, mineral, current, scientific, naming, schemes, refer, primarily, to, the, microstructure, of, the, mineral, color, is, a, secondary, identifier, for, the, cryptocrystalline, minerals, although, it, is, a, primary, identifier, for, the, macrocrystalline, varieties, pure, quartz, traditionally, called, rock, crystal, or, clear, quartz, is, colorless, and, transparent, or, translucent, and, has, often, been, used, for, hardstone, carvings, such, as, the, lothair, crystal, common, colored, varieties, include, citrine, rose, quartz, amethyst, smoky, quartz, milky, quartz, and, others, these, color, differentiations, arise, from, the, presence, of, impurities, which, change, the, molecular, orbitals, causing, some, electronic, transitions, to, take, place, in, the, visible, spectrum, causing, colors, the, most, important, distinction, between, types, of, quartz, is, that, of, macrocrystalline, individual, crystals, visible, to, the, unaided, eye, and, the, microcrystalline, or, cryptocrystalline, varieties, aggregates, of, crystals, visible, only, under, high, magnification, the, cryptocrystalline, varieties, are, either, translucent, or, mostly, opaque, while, the, transparent, varieties, tend, to, be, macrocrystalline, chalcedony, is, a, cryptocrystalline, form, of, silica, consisting, of, fine, intergrowths, of, both, quartz, and, its, monoclinic, polymorph, moganite, other, opaque, gemstone, varieties, of, quartz, or, mixed, rocks, including, quartz, often, including, contrasting, bands, or, patterns, of, color, are, agate, carnelian, or, sard, onyx, heliotrope, and, jasper, amethyst, is, a, form, of, quartz, that, ranges, from, a, bright, vivid, violet, to, a, dark, or, dull, lavender, shade, the, world, s, largest, deposits, of, amethysts, can, be, found, in, brazil, mexico, uruguay, russia, france, namibia, and, morocco, sometimes, amethyst, and, citrine, are, found, growing, in, the, same, crystal, it, is, then, referred, to, as, ametrine, amethyst, derives, its, color, from, traces, of, iron, in, its, structure, blue, quartz, contains, inclusions, of, fibrous, magnesio, riebeckite, or, crocidolite, inclusions, of, the, mineral, dumortierite, within, quartz, pieces, often, result, in, silky, appearing, splotches, with, a, blue, hue, shades, of, purple, or, grey, sometimes, also, are, present, dumortierite, quartz, sometimes, called, blue, quartz, will, sometimes, feature, contrasting, light, and, dark, color, zones, across, the, material, blue, quartz, is, a, minor, gemstone, citrine, is, a, variety, of, quartz, whose, color, ranges, from, pale, yellow, to, brown, due, to, a, submicroscopic, distribution, of, colloidal, ferric, hydroxide, impurities, natural, citrines, are, rare, most, commercial, citrines, are, heat, treated, amethysts, or, smoky, quartzes, however, a, heat, treated, amethyst, will, have, small, lines, in, the, crystal, as, opposed, to, a, natural, citrine, s, cloudy, or, smoky, appearance, it, is, nearly, impossible, to, differentiate, between, cut, citrine, and, yellow, topaz, visually, but, they, differ, in, hardness, brazil, is, the, leading, producer, of, citrine, with, much, of, its, production, coming, from, the, state, of, rio, grande, do, sul, the, name, is, derived, from, the, latin, word, citrina, which, means, yellow, and, is, also, the, origin, of, the, word, citron, sometimes, citrine, and, amethyst, can, be, found, together, in, the, same, crystal, which, is, then, referred, to, as, ametrine, citrine, has, been, referred, to, as, the, merchant, s, stone, or, money, stone, due, to, a, superstition, that, it, would, bring, prosperity, citrine, was, first, appreciated, as, a, golden, yellow, gemstone, in, greece, between, 300, and, 150, bc, during, the, hellenistic, age, yellow, quartz, was, used, prior, to, that, to, decorate, jewelry, and, tools, but, it, was, not, highly, sought, after, milk, quartz, or, milky, quartz, is, the, most, common, variety, of, crystalline, quartz, the, white, color, is, caused, by, minute, fluid, inclusions, of, gas, liquid, or, both, trapped, during, crystal, formation, making, it, of, little, value, for, optical, and, quality, gemstone, applications, rose, quartz, is, a, type, of, quartz, that, exhibits, a, pale, pink, to, rose, red, hue, the, color, is, usually, considered, as, due, to, trace, amounts, of, titanium, iron, or, manganese, in, the, material, some, rose, quartz, contains, microscopic, rutile, needles, that, produce, asterism, in, transmitted, light, recent, x, ray, diffraction, studies, suggest, that, the, color, is, due, to, thin, microscopic, fibers, of, possibly, dumortierite, within, the, quartz, additionally, there, is, a, rare, type, of, pink, quartz, also, frequently, called, crystalline, rose, quartz, with, color, that, is, thought, to, be, caused, by, trace, amounts, of, phosphate, or, aluminium, the, color, in, crystals, is, apparently, photosensitive, and, subject, to, fading, the, first, crystals, were, found, in, a, pegmatite, found, near, rumford, maine, us, and, in, minas, gerais, brazil, the, crystals, found, are, more, transparent, and, euhedral, due, to, the, impurities, of, phosphate, and, aluminium, that, formed, crystalline, rose, quartz, unlike, the, iron, and, microscopic, dumortierite, fibers, that, formed, rose, quartz, smoky, quartz, is, a, gray, translucent, version, of, quartz, it, ranges, in, clarity, from, almost, complete, transparency, to, a, brownish, gray, crystal, that, is, almost, opaque, some, can, also, be, black, the, translucency, results, from, natural, irradiation, acting, on, minute, traces, of, aluminum, in, the, crystal, structure, prase, is, a, green, variety, of, quartz, the, green, color, is, caused, by, inclusions, of, amphibole, prasiolite, also, known, as, vermarine, is, a, variety, of, quartz, that, is, green, in, color, the, green, is, caused, by, iron, ions, it, is, a, rare, mineral, in, nature, and, is, typically, found, with, amethyst, most, prasiolite, is, not, natural, it, has, been, artificially, produced, by, heating, of, amethyst, since, 1950, almost, all, natural, prasiolite, has, come, from, a, small, brazilian, mine, but, it, is, also, seen, in, lower, silesia, in, poland, naturally, occurring, prasiolite, is, also, found, in, the, thunder, bay, area, of, canada, quartz, crystals, have, piezoelectric, properties, they, develop, an, electric, potential, upon, the, application, of, mechanical, stress, quartz, s, piezoelectric, properties, were, discovered, by, jacques, and, pierre, curie, in, 1880, quartz, is, a, defining, constituent, of, granite, and, other, felsic, igneous, rocks, it, is, very, common, in, sedimentary, rocks, such, as, sandstone, and, shale, it, is, a, common, constituent, of, schist, gneiss, quartzite, and, other, metamorphic, rocks, quartz, has, the, lowest, potential, for, weathering, in, the, goldich, dissolution, series, and, consequently, it, is, very, common, as, a, residual, mineral, in, stream, sediments, and, residual, soils, generally, a, high, presence, of, quartz, suggests, a, mature, rock, since, it, indicates, the, rock, has, been, heavily, reworked, and, quartz, was, the, primary, mineral, that, endured, heavy, weathering, while, the, majority, of, quartz, crystallizes, from, molten, magma, quartz, also, chemically, precipitates, from, hot, hydrothermal, veins, as, gangue, sometimes, with, ore, minerals, like, gold, silver, and, copper, large, crystals, of, quartz, are, found, in, magmatic, pegmatites, well, formed, crystals, may, reach, several, meters, in, length, and, weigh, hundreds, of, kilograms, the, largest, documented, single, crystal, of, quartz, was, found, near, itapore, goiaz, brazil, it, measured, approximately, 6, 1, m, 1, 5, m, 1, 5, m, 20, ft, 5, ft, 5, ft, and, weighed, over, 39, 900, kg, 88, 000, lb, quartz, is, extracted, from, open, pit, mines, miners, occasionally, use, explosives, to, expose, deep, pockets, of, quartz, more, frequently, bulldozers, and, backhoes, are, used, to, remove, soil, and, clay, and, expose, quartz, veins, which, are, then, worked, using, hand, tools, care, must, be, taken, to, avoid, sudden, temperature, changes, that, may, damage, the, crystals, tridymite, and, cristobalite, are, high, temperature, polymorphs, of, sio, 2, that, occur, in, high, silica, volcanic, rocks, coesite, is, a, denser, polymorph, of, sio, 2, found, in, some, meteorite, impact, sites, and, in, metamorphic, rocks, formed, at, pressures, greater, than, those, typical, of, the, earth, s, crust, stishovite, is, a, yet, denser, and, higher, pressure, polymorph, of, sio, 2, found, in, some, meteorite, impact, sites, moganite, is, a, monoclinic, polymorph, lechatelierite, is, an, amorphous, silica, glass, sio, 2, which, is, formed, by, lightning, strikes, in, quartz, sand, as, quartz, is, a, form, of, silica, it, is, a, possible, cause, for, concern, in, various, workplaces, cutting, grinding, chipping, sanding, drilling, and, polishing, natural, and, manufactured, stone, products, can, release, hazardous, levels, of, very, small, crystalline, silica, dust, particles, into, the, air, that, workers, breathe, crystalline, silica, of, respirable, size, is, a, recognized, human, carcinogen, and, may, lead, to, other, diseases, of, the, lungs, such, as, silicosis, and, pulmonary, fibrosis, not, all, varieties, of, quartz, are, naturally, occurring, some, clear, quartz, crystals, can, be, treated, using, heat, or, gamma, irradiation, to, induce, color, where, it, would, not, otherwise, have, occurred, naturally, susceptibility, to, such, treatments, depends, on, the, location, from, which, the, quartz, was, mined, prasiolite, an, olive, colored, material, is, produced, by, heat, treatment, natural, prasiolite, has, also, been, observed, in, lower, silesia, in, poland, although, citrine, occurs, naturally, the, majority, is, the, result, of, heat, treating, amethyst, or, smoky, quartz, carnelian, has, been, heat, treated, to, deepen, its, color, since, prehistoric, times, because, natural, quartz, is, often, twinned, synthetic, quartz, is, produced, for, use, in, industry, large, flawless, single, crystals, are, synthesized, in, an, autoclave, via, the, hydrothermal, process, like, other, crystals, quartz, may, be, coated, with, metal, vapors, to, give, it, an, attractive, sheen, quartz, is, the, most, common, material, identified, as, the, mystical, substance, maban, in, australian, aboriginal, mythology, it, is, found, regularly, in, passage, tomb, cemeteries, in, europe, in, a, burial, context, such, as, newgrange, or, carrowmore, in, ireland, quartz, was, also, used, in, prehistoric, ireland, as, well, as, many, other, countries, for, stone, tools, both, vein, quartz, and, rock, crystal, were, knapped, as, part, of, the, lithic, technology, of, the, prehistoric, peoples, while, jade, has, been, since, earliest, times, the, most, prized, semi, precious, stone, for, carving, in, east, asia, and, pre, columbian, america, in, europe, and, the, middle, east, the, different, varieties, of, quartz, were, the, most, commonly, used, for, the, various, types, of, jewelry, and, hardstone, carving, including, engraved, gems, and, cameo, gems, rock, crystal, vases, and, extravagant, vessels, the, tradition, continued, to, produce, objects, that, were, very, highly, valued, until, the, mid, 19th, century, when, it, largely, fell, from, fashion, except, in, jewelry, cameo, technique, exploits, the, bands, of, color, in, onyx, and, other, varieties, efforts, to, synthesize, quartz, began, in, the, mid, nineteenth, century, as, scientists, attempted, to, create, minerals, under, laboratory, conditions, that, mimicked, the, conditions, in, which, the, minerals, formed, in, nature, german, geologist, karl, emil, von, schafh, utl, 1803, 1890, was, the, first, person, to, synthesize, quartz, when, in, 1845, he, created, microscopic, quartz, crystals, in, a, pressure, cooker, however, the, quality, and, size, of, the, crystals, that, were, produced, by, these, early, efforts, were, poor, elemental, impurity, incorporation, strongly, influences, the, ability, to, process, and, utilize, quartz, naturally, occurring, quartz, crystals, of, extremely, high, purity, necessary, for, the, crucibles, and, other, equipment, used, for, growing, silicon, wafers, in, the, semiconductor, industry, are, expensive, and, rare, these, high, purity, quartz, are, defined, as, containing, less, than, 50, ppm, of, impurity, elements, a, major, mining, location, for, high, purity, quartz, is, the, spruce, pine, gem, mine, in, spruce, pine, north, carolina, united, states, quartz, may, also, be, found, in, caldoveiro, peak, in, asturias, spain, by, the, 1930s, the, electronics, industry, had, become, dependent, on, quartz, crystals, the, only, source, of, suitable, crystals, was, brazil, however, world, war, ii, disrupted, the, supplies, from, brazil, so, nations, attempted, to, synthesize, quartz, on, a, commercial, scale, german, mineralogist, richard, nacken, 1884, 1971, achieved, some, success, during, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, after, the, war, many, laboratories, attempted, to, grow, large, quartz, crystals, in, the, united, states, the, u, s, army, signal, corps, contracted, with, bell, laboratories, and, with, the, brush, development, company, of, cleveland, ohio, to, synthesize, crystals, following, nacken, s, lead, prior, to, world, war, ii, brush, development, produced, piezoelectric, crystals, for, record, players, by, 1948, brush, development, had, grown, crystals, that, were, 1, 5, inches, 3, 8, cm, in, diameter, the, largest, at, that, time, by, the, 1950s, hydrothermal, synthesis, techniques, were, producing, synthetic, quartz, crystals, on, an, industrial, scale, and, today, virtually, all, the, quartz, crystal, used, in, the, modern, electronics, industry, is, synthetic, an, early, use, of, the, piezoelectricity, of, quartz, crystals, was, in, phonograph, pickups, one, of, the, most, common, piezoelectric, uses, of, quartz, today, is, as, a, crystal, oscillator, the, quartz, oscillator, or, resonator, was, first, developed, by, walter, guyton, cady, in, 1921, george, washington, pierce, designed, and, patented, quartz, crystal, oscillators, in, 1923, the, quartz, clock, is, a, familiar, device, using, the, mineral, warren, marrison, created, the, first, quartz, oscillator, clock, based, on, the, work, of, cady, and, pierce, in, 1927, the, resonant, frequency, of, a, quartz, crystal, oscillator, is, changed, by, mechanically, loading, it, and, this, principle, is, used, for, very, accurate, measurements, of, very, small, mass, changes, in, the, quartz, crystal, microbalance, and, in, thin, film, thickness, monitors, almost, all, the, industrial, demand, for, quartz, crystal, used, primarily, in, electronics, is, met, with, synthetic, quartz, produced, by, the, hydrothermal, process, however, synthetic, crystals, are, less, prized, for, use, as, gemstones, the, popularity, of, crystal, healing, has, increased, the, demand, for, natural, quartz, crystals, which, are, now, often, mined, in, developing, countries, using, primitive, mining, methods, sometimes, involving, child, labor
