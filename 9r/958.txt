in, physics, quantum, tunnelling, barrier, penetration, or, simply, tunnelling, is, a, quantum, mechanical, phenomenon, in, which, an, object, such, as, an, electron, or, atom, passes, through, a, potential, energy, barrier, that, according, to, classical, mechanics, should, not, be, passable, due, to, the, object, not, having, sufficient, energy, to, pass, or, surmount, the, barrier, tunneling, is, a, consequence, of, the, wave, nature, of, matter, where, the, quantum, wave, function, describes, the, state, of, a, particle, or, other, physical, system, and, wave, equations, such, as, the, schr, dinger, equation, describe, their, behavior, the, probability, of, transmission, of, a, wave, packet, through, a, barrier, decreases, exponentially, with, the, barrier, height, the, barrier, width, and, the, tunneling, particle, s, mass, so, tunneling, is, seen, most, prominently, in, low, mass, particles, such, as, electrons, or, protons, tunneling, through, microscopically, narrow, barriers, tunneling, is, readily, detectable, with, barriers, of, thickness, about, 1, 3, nm, or, smaller, for, electrons, and, about, 0, 1, nm, or, smaller, for, heavier, particles, such, as, protons, or, hydrogen, atoms, some, sources, describe, the, mere, penetration, of, a, wave, function, into, the, barrier, without, transmission, on, the, other, side, as, a, tunneling, effect, such, as, in, tunneling, into, the, walls, of, a, finite, potential, well, tunneling, plays, an, essential, role, in, physical, phenomena, such, as, nuclear, fusion, and, alpha, radioactive, decay, of, atomic, nuclei, tunneling, applications, include, the, tunnel, diode, quantum, computing, flash, memory, and, the, scanning, tunneling, microscope, tunneling, limits, the, minimum, size, of, devices, used, in, microelectronics, because, electrons, tunnel, readily, through, insulating, layers, and, transistors, that, are, thinner, than, about, 1, nm, the, effect, was, predicted, in, the, early, 20th, century, its, acceptance, as, a, general, physical, phenomenon, came, mid, century, quantum, tunnelling, falls, under, the, domain, of, quantum, mechanics, to, understand, the, phenomenon, particles, attempting, to, travel, across, a, potential, barrier, can, be, compared, to, a, ball, trying, to, roll, over, a, hill, quantum, mechanics, and, classical, mechanics, differ, in, their, treatment, of, this, scenario, classical, mechanics, predicts, that, particles, that, do, not, have, enough, energy, to, classically, surmount, a, barrier, cannot, reach, the, other, side, thus, a, ball, without, sufficient, energy, to, surmount, the, hill, would, roll, back, down, in, quantum, mechanics, a, particle, can, with, a, small, probability, tunnel, to, the, other, side, thus, crossing, the, barrier, the, reason, for, this, difference, comes, from, treating, matter, as, having, properties, of, waves, and, particles, the, wave, function, of, a, physical, system, of, particles, specifies, everything, that, can, be, known, about, the, system, therefore, problems, in, quantum, mechanics, analyze, the, system, s, wave, function, using, mathematical, formulations, such, as, the, schr, dinger, equation, the, time, evolution, of, a, known, wave, function, can, be, deduced, the, square, of, the, absolute, value, of, this, wave, function, is, directly, related, to, the, probability, distribution, of, the, particle, positions, which, describes, the, probability, that, the, particles, would, be, measured, at, those, positions, as, shown, in, the, animation, a, wave, packet, impinges, on, the, barrier, most, of, it, is, reflected, and, some, is, transmitted, through, the, barrier, the, wave, packet, becomes, more, de, localized, it, is, now, on, both, sides, of, the, barrier, and, lower, in, maximum, amplitude, but, equal, in, integrated, square, magnitude, meaning, that, the, probability, the, particle, is, somewhere, remains, unity, the, wider, the, barrier, and, the, higher, the, barrier, energy, the, lower, the, probability, of, tunneling, some, models, of, a, tunneling, barrier, such, as, the, rectangular, barriers, shown, can, be, analysed, and, solved, algebraically, 96, most, problems, do, not, have, an, algebraic, solution, so, numerical, solutions, are, used, semiclassical, methods, offer, approximate, solutions, that, are, easier, to, compute, such, as, the, wkb, approximation, the, schr, dinger, equation, was, published, in, 1926, the, first, person, to, apply, the, schr, dinger, equation, to, a, problem, that, involved, tunneling, between, two, classically, allowed, regions, through, a, potential, barrier, was, friedrich, hund, in, a, series, of, articles, published, in, 1927, he, studied, the, solutions, of, a, double, well, potential, and, discussed, molecular, spectra, leonid, mandelstam, and, mikhail, leontovich, discovered, tunneling, independently, and, published, their, results, in, 1928, in, 1927, lothar, nordheim, assisted, by, ralph, fowler, published, a, paper, that, discussed, thermionic, emission, and, reflection, of, electrons, from, metals, he, assumed, a, surface, potential, barrier, that, confines, the, electrons, within, the, metal, and, showed, that, the, electrons, have, a, finite, probability, of, tunneling, through, or, reflecting, from, the, surface, barrier, when, their, energies, are, close, to, the, barrier, energy, classically, the, electron, would, either, transmit, or, reflect, with, 100, certainty, depending, on, its, energy, in, 1928, j, robert, oppenheimer, published, two, papers, on, field, emission, i, e, the, emission, of, electrons, induced, by, strong, electric, fields, nordheim, and, fowler, simplified, oppenheimer, s, derivation, and, found, values, for, the, emitted, currents, and, work, functions, that, agreed, with, experiments, a, great, success, of, the, tunnelling, theory, was, the, mathematical, explanation, for, alpha, decay, which, was, developed, in, 1928, by, george, gamow, and, independently, by, ronald, gurney, and, edward, condon, the, latter, researchers, simultaneously, solved, the, schr, dinger, equation, for, a, model, nuclear, potential, and, derived, a, relationship, between, the, half, life, of, the, particle, and, the, energy, of, emission, that, depended, directly, on, the, mathematical, probability, of, tunneling, all, three, researchers, were, familiar, with, the, works, on, field, emission, and, gamow, was, aware, of, mandelstam, and, leontovich, s, findings, in, the, early, days, of, quantum, theory, the, term, tunnel, effect, was, not, used, and, the, effect, was, instead, referred, to, as, penetration, of, or, leaking, through, a, barrier, the, german, term, wellenmechanische, tunneleffekt, was, used, in, 1931, by, walter, schottky, the, english, term, tunnel, effect, entered, the, language, in, 1932, when, it, was, used, by, yakov, frenkel, in, his, textbook, in, 1957, leo, esaki, demonstrated, tunneling, of, electrons, over, a, few, nanometer, wide, barrier, in, a, semiconductor, structure, and, developed, a, diode, based, on, tunnel, effect, in, 1960, following, esaki, s, work, ivar, giaever, showed, experimentally, that, tunnelling, also, took, place, in, superconductors, the, tunnelling, spectrum, gave, direct, evidence, of, the, superconducting, energy, gap, in, 1962, brian, josephson, predicted, the, tunneling, of, superconducting, cooper, pairs, esaki, giaever, and, josephson, shared, the, 1973, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, their, works, on, quantum, tunneling, in, solids, in, 1981, gerd, binnig, and, heinrich, rohrer, developed, a, new, type, of, microscope, called, scanning, tunneling, microscope, which, is, based, on, tunnelling, and, is, used, for, imaging, surfaces, at, the, atomic, level, binnig, and, rohrer, were, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 1986, for, their, discovery, tunnelling, is, the, cause, of, some, important, macroscopic, physical, phenomena, tunnelling, is, a, source, of, current, leakage, in, very, large, scale, integration, vlsi, electronics, and, results, in, a, substantial, power, drain, and, heating, effects, that, plague, such, devices, it, is, considered, the, lower, limit, on, how, microelectronic, device, elements, can, be, made, tunnelling, is, a, fundamental, technique, used, to, program, the, floating, gates, of, flash, memory, cold, emission, of, electrons, is, relevant, to, semiconductors, and, superconductor, physics, it, is, similar, to, thermionic, emission, where, electrons, randomly, jump, from, the, surface, of, a, metal, to, follow, a, voltage, bias, because, they, statistically, end, up, with, more, energy, than, the, barrier, through, random, collisions, with, other, particles, when, the, electric, field, is, very, large, the, barrier, becomes, thin, enough, for, electrons, to, tunnel, out, of, the, atomic, state, leading, to, a, current, that, varies, approximately, exponentially, with, the, electric, field, these, materials, are, important, for, flash, memory, vacuum, tubes, and, some, electron, microscopes, a, simple, barrier, can, be, created, by, separating, two, conductors, with, a, very, thin, insulator, these, are, tunnel, junctions, the, study, of, which, requires, understanding, quantum, tunnelling, josephson, junctions, take, advantage, of, quantum, tunnelling, and, superconductivity, to, create, the, josephson, effect, this, has, applications, in, precision, measurements, of, voltages, and, magnetic, fields, as, well, as, the, multijunction, solar, cell, diodes, are, electrical, semiconductor, devices, that, allow, electric, current, flow, in, one, direction, more, than, the, other, the, device, depends, on, a, depletion, layer, between, n, type, and, p, type, semiconductors, to, serve, its, purpose, when, these, are, heavily, doped, the, depletion, layer, can, be, thin, enough, for, tunnelling, when, a, small, forward, bias, is, applied, the, current, due, to, tunnelling, is, significant, this, has, a, maximum, at, the, point, where, the, voltage, bias, is, such, that, the, energy, level, of, the, p, and, n, conduction, bands, are, the, same, as, the, voltage, bias, is, increased, the, two, conduction, bands, no, longer, line, up, and, the, diode, acts, typically, because, the, tunnelling, current, drops, off, rapidly, tunnel, diodes, can, be, created, that, have, a, range, of, voltages, for, which, current, decreases, as, voltage, increases, this, peculiar, property, is, used, in, some, applications, such, as, high, speed, devices, where, the, characteristic, tunnelling, probability, changes, as, rapidly, as, the, bias, voltage, the, resonant, tunnelling, diode, makes, use, of, quantum, tunnelling, in, a, very, different, manner, to, achieve, a, similar, result, this, diode, has, a, resonant, voltage, for, which, a, current, favors, a, particular, voltage, achieved, by, placing, two, thin, layers, with, a, high, energy, conductance, band, near, each, other, this, creates, a, quantum, potential, well, that, has, a, discrete, lowest, energy, level, when, this, energy, level, is, higher, than, that, of, the, electrons, no, tunnelling, occurs, and, the, diode, is, in, reverse, bias, once, the, two, voltage, energies, align, the, electrons, flow, like, an, open, wire, as, the, voltage, further, increases, tunnelling, becomes, improbable, and, the, diode, acts, like, a, normal, diode, again, before, a, second, energy, level, becomes, noticeable, a, european, research, project, demonstrated, field, effect, transistors, in, which, the, gate, channel, is, controlled, via, quantum, tunnelling, rather, than, by, thermal, injection, reducing, gate, voltage, from, 1, volt, to, 0, 2, volts, and, reducing, power, consumption, by, up, to, 100, if, these, transistors, can, be, scaled, up, into, vlsi, chips, they, would, improve, the, performance, per, power, of, integrated, circuits, while, the, drude, lorentz, model, of, electrical, conductivity, makes, excellent, predictions, about, the, nature, of, electrons, conducting, in, metals, it, can, be, furthered, by, using, quantum, tunnelling, to, explain, the, nature, of, the, electron, s, collisions, when, a, free, electron, wave, packet, encounters, a, long, array, of, uniformly, spaced, barriers, the, reflected, part, of, the, wave, packet, interferes, uniformly, with, the, transmitted, one, between, all, barriers, so, that, 100, transmission, becomes, possible, the, theory, predicts, that, if, positively, charged, nuclei, form, a, perfectly, rectangular, array, electrons, will, tunnel, through, the, metal, as, free, electrons, leading, to, extremely, high, conductance, and, that, impurities, in, the, metal, will, disrupt, it, the, scanning, tunnelling, microscope, stm, invented, by, gerd, binnig, and, heinrich, rohrer, may, allow, imaging, of, individual, atoms, on, the, surface, of, a, material, it, operates, by, taking, advantage, of, the, relationship, between, quantum, tunnelling, with, distance, when, the, tip, of, the, stm, s, needle, is, brought, close, to, a, conduction, surface, that, has, a, voltage, bias, measuring, the, current, of, electrons, that, are, tunnelling, between, the, needle, and, the, surface, reveals, the, distance, between, the, needle, and, the, surface, by, using, piezoelectric, rods, that, change, in, size, when, voltage, is, applied, the, height, of, the, tip, can, be, adjusted, to, keep, the, tunnelling, current, constant, the, time, varying, voltages, that, are, applied, to, these, rods, can, be, recorded, and, used, to, image, the, surface, of, the, conductor, stms, are, accurate, to, 0, 001, nm, or, about, 1, of, atomic, diameter, quantum, tunnelling, is, an, essential, phenomenon, for, nuclear, fusion, the, temperature, in, stellar, cores, is, generally, insufficient, to, allow, atomic, nuclei, to, overcome, the, coulomb, barrier, and, achieve, thermonuclear, fusion, quantum, tunnelling, increases, the, probability, of, penetrating, this, barrier, though, this, probability, is, still, low, the, extremely, large, number, of, nuclei, in, the, core, of, a, star, is, sufficient, to, sustain, a, steady, fusion, reaction, radioactive, decay, is, the, process, of, emission, of, particles, and, energy, from, the, unstable, nucleus, of, an, atom, to, form, a, stable, product, this, is, done, via, the, tunnelling, of, a, particle, out, of, the, nucleus, an, electron, tunneling, into, the, nucleus, is, electron, capture, this, was, the, first, application, of, quantum, tunnelling, radioactive, decay, is, a, relevant, issue, for, astrobiology, as, this, consequence, of, quantum, tunnelling, creates, a, constant, energy, source, over, a, large, time, interval, for, environments, outside, the, circumstellar, habitable, zone, where, insolation, would, not, be, possible, subsurface, oceans, or, effective, quantum, tunnelling, may, be, one, of, the, mechanisms, of, hypothetical, proton, decay, chemical, reactions, in, the, interstellar, medium, occur, at, extremely, low, energies, probably, the, most, fundamental, ion, molecule, reaction, involves, hydrogen, ions, with, hydrogen, molecules, the, quantum, mechanical, tunnelling, rate, for, the, same, reaction, using, the, hydrogen, isotope, deuterium, d, h, 2, h, hd, has, been, measured, experimentally, in, an, ion, trap, the, deuterium, was, placed, in, an, ion, trap, and, cooled, the, trap, was, then, filled, with, hydrogen, at, the, temperatures, used, in, the, experiment, the, energy, barrier, for, reaction, would, not, allow, the, reaction, to, succeed, with, classical, dynamics, alone, quantum, tunneling, allowed, reactions, to, happen, in, rare, collisions, it, was, calculated, from, the, experimental, data, that, collisions, happened, one, in, every, hundred, billion, in, chemical, kinetics, the, substitution, of, a, light, isotope, of, an, element, with, a, heavier, one, typically, results, in, a, slower, reaction, rate, this, is, generally, attributed, to, differences, in, the, zero, point, vibrational, energies, for, chemical, bonds, containing, the, lighter, and, heavier, isotopes, and, is, generally, modeled, using, transition, state, theory, however, in, certain, cases, large, isotopic, effects, are, observed, that, cannot, be, accounted, for, by, a, semi, classical, treatment, and, quantum, tunnelling, is, required, r, p, bell, developed, a, modified, treatment, of, arrhenius, kinetics, that, is, commonly, used, to, model, this, phenomenon, by, including, quantum, tunnelling, the, astrochemical, syntheses, of, various, molecules, in, interstellar, clouds, can, be, explained, such, as, the, synthesis, of, molecular, hydrogen, water, ice, and, the, prebiotic, important, formaldehyde, tunnelling, of, molecular, hydrogen, has, been, observed, in, the, lab, quantum, tunnelling, is, among, the, central, non, trivial, quantum, effects, in, quantum, biology, here, it, is, important, both, as, electron, tunnelling, and, proton, tunnelling, electron, tunnelling, is, a, key, factor, in, many, biochemical, redox, reactions, photosynthesis, cellular, respiration, as, well, as, enzymatic, catalysis, proton, tunnelling, is, a, key, factor, in, spontaneous, dna, mutation, spontaneous, mutation, occurs, when, normal, dna, replication, takes, place, after, a, particularly, significant, proton, has, tunnelled, a, hydrogen, bond, joins, dna, base, pairs, a, double, well, potential, along, a, hydrogen, bond, separates, a, potential, energy, barrier, it, is, believed, that, the, double, well, potential, is, asymmetric, with, one, well, deeper, than, the, other, such, that, the, proton, normally, rests, in, the, deeper, well, for, a, mutation, to, occur, the, proton, must, have, tunnelled, into, the, shallower, well, the, proton, s, movement, from, its, regular, position, is, called, a, tautomeric, transition, if, dna, replication, takes, place, in, this, state, the, base, pairing, rule, for, dna, may, be, jeopardised, causing, a, mutation, per, olov, lowdin, was, the, first, to, develop, this, theory, of, spontaneous, mutation, within, the, double, helix, other, instances, of, quantum, tunnelling, induced, mutations, in, biology, are, believed, to, be, a, cause, of, ageing, and, cancer, the, time, independent, schr, dinger, equation, for, one, particle, in, one, dimension, can, be, written, as, 2, 2, m, d, 2, d, x, 2,

of, x, depending, on, whether, m, x, is, positive, or, negative, when, m, x, is, constant, and, negative, then, the, schr, dinger, equation, can, be, written, in, the, form, d, 2, d, x, 2, x, 2, m, 2,

of, this, equation, represent, travelling, waves, with, phase, constant, k, or, k, alternatively, if, m, x, is, constant, and, positive, then, the, schr, dinger, equation, can, be, written, in, the, form, d, 2, d, x, 2, x, 2, m, 2, m, x, x, 2, x, where, 2, 2, m, 2, m, displaystyle, frac, d, 2, dx, 2, psi, x, frac, 2m, hbar, 2, m, x, psi, x, kappa, 2, psi, x, qquad, text, where, quad, kappa, 2,

behaviour, occurs, depending, on, whether, m, x, is, negative, or, positive, it, follows, that, the, sign, of, m, x, determines, the, nature, of, the, medium, with, negative, m, x, corresponding, to, medium, a, and, positive, m, x, corresponding, to, medium, b, it, thus, follows, that, evanescent, wave, coupling, can, occur, if, a, region, of, positive, m, x, is, sandwiched, between, two, regions, of, negative, m, x, hence, creating, a, potential, barrier, the, mathematics, of, dealing, with, the, situation, where, m, x, varies, with, x, is, difficult, except, in, special, cases, that, usually, do, not, correspond, to, physical, reality, a, full, mathematical, treatment, appears, in, the, 1965, monograph, by, fr, man, and, fr, man, their, ideas, have, not, been, incorporated, into, physics,

the, limiting, solutions, given, the, two, coefficients, on, one, side, of, a, classical, turning, point, the, two, coefficients, on, the, other, side, of, a, classical, turning, point, can, be, determined, by, using, this, local, solution, to, connect, them, hence, the, airy, function, solutions, will, asymptote, into, sine, cosine, and, exponential, functions, in, the, proper, limits, the,

some, physicists, have, claimed, that, it, is, possible, for, spin, zero, particles, to, travel, faster, than, the, speed, of, light, when, tunnelling, this, appears, to, violate, the, principle, of, causality, since, a, frame, of, reference, then, exists, in, which, the, particle, arrives, before, it, has, left, in, 1998, francis, e, low, reviewed, briefly, the, phenomenon, of, zero, time, tunnelling, more, recently, experimental, tunnelling, time, data, of, phonons, photons, and, electrons, was, published, by, g, nter, nimtz, another, experiment, overseen, by, a, m, steinberg, seems, to, indicate, that, particles, could, tunnel, at, apparent, speeds, faster, than, light, other, physicists, such, as, herbert, winful, disputed, these, claims, winful, argued, that, the, wave, packet, of, a, tunnelling, particle, propagates, locally, so, a, particle, can, t, tunnel, through, the, barrier, non, locally, winful, also, argued, that, the, experiments, that, are, purported, to, show, non, local, propagation, have, been, misinterpreted, in, particular, the, group, velocity, of, a, wave, packet, does, not, measure, its, speed, but, is, related, to, the, amount, of, time, the, wave, packet, is, stored, in, the, barrier, moreover, if, quantum, tunneling, is, modeled, with, the, relativistic, dirac, equation, well, established, mathematical, theorems, imply, that, the, process, is, completely, subluminal, the, concept, of, quantum, tunneling, can, be, extended, to, situations, where, there, exists, a, quantum, transport, between, regions, that, are, classically, not, connected, even, if, there, is, no, associated, potential, barrier, this, phenomenon, is, known, as, dynamical, tunnelling, the, concept, of, dynamical, tunnelling, is, particularly, suited, to, address, the, problem, of, quantum, tunnelling, in, high, dimensions, d, 1, in, the, case, of, an, integrable, system, where, bounded, classical, trajectories, are, confined, onto, tori, in, phase, space, tunnelling, can, be, understood, as, the, quantum, transport, between, semi, classical, states, built, on, two, distinct, but, symmetric, tori, in, real, life, most, systems, are, not, integrable, and, display, various, degrees, of, chaos, classical, dynamics, is, then, said, to, be, mixed, and, the, system, phase, space, is, typically, composed, of, islands, of, regular, orbits, surrounded, by, a, large, sea, of, chaotic, orbits, the, existence, of, the, chaotic, sea, where, transport, is, classically, allowed, between, the, two, symmetric, tori, then, assists, the, quantum, tunnelling, between, them, this, phenomenon, is, referred, as, chaos, assisted, tunnelling, and, is, characterized, by, sharp, resonances, of, the, tunnelling, rate, when, varying, any, system, parameter, when, displaystyle, hbar, is, small, in, front, of, the, size, of, the, regular, islands, the, fine, structure, of, the, classical, phase, space, plays, a, key, role, in, tunnelling, in, particular, the, two, symmetric, tori, are, coupled, via, a, succession, of, classically, forbidden, transitions, across, nonlinear, resonances, surrounding, the, two, islands, several, phenomena, have, the, same, behavior, as, quantum, tunnelling, two, examples, are, evanescent, wave, coupling, the, application, of, maxwell, s, wave, equation, to, light, and, the, application, of, the, non, dispersive, wave, equation, from, acoustics, applied, to, waves, on, strings, these, effects, are, modeled, similarly, to, the, rectangular, potential, barrier, in, these, cases, one, transmission, medium, through, which, the, wave, propagates, that, is, the, same, or, nearly, the, same, throughout, and, a, second, medium, through, which, the, wave, travels, differently, this, can, be, described, as, a, thin, region, of, medium, b, between, two, regions, of, medium, a, the, analysis, of, a, rectangular, barrier, by, means, of, the, schr, dinger, equation, can, be, adapted, to, these, other, effects, provided, that, the, wave, equation, has, travelling, wave, solutions, in, medium, a, but, real, exponential, solutions, in, medium, b, in, optics, medium, a, is, a, vacuum, while, medium, b, is, glass, in, acoustics, medium, a, may, be, a, liquid, or, gas, and, medium, b, a, solid, for, both, cases, medium, a, is, a, region, of, space, where, the, particle, s, total, energy, is, greater, than, its, potential, energy, and, medium, b, is, the, potential, barrier, these, have, an, incoming, wave, and, resultant, waves, in, both, directions, there, can, be, more, mediums, and, barriers, and, the, barriers, need, not, be, discrete, approximations, are, useful, in, this, case, a, classical, wave, particle, association, was, originally, analyzed, as, analogous, to, quantum, tunneling, but, subsequent, analysis, found, a, fluid, dynamics, cause, related, to, the, vertical, momentum, imparted, to, particles, near, the, barrier
