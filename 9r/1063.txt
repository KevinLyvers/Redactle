general, relativity, also, known, as, the, general, theory, of, relativity, and, as, einstein, s, theory, of, gravity, is, the, geometric, theory, of, gravitation, published, by, albert, einstein, in, 1915, and, is, the, current, description, of, gravitation, in, modern, physics, general, relativity, generalizes, special, relativity, and, refines, newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, providing, a, unified, description, of, gravity, as, a, geometric, property, of, space, and, time, or, four, dimensional, spacetime, in, particular, the, curvature, of, spacetime, is, directly, related, to, the, energy, and, momentum, of, whatever, matter, and, radiation, are, present, the, relation, is, specified, by, the, einstein, field, equations, a, system, of, second, order, partial, differential, equations, newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, which, describes, classical, gravity, can, be, seen, as, a, prediction, of, general, relativity, for, the, almost, flat, spacetime, geometry, around, stationary, mass, distributions, some, predictions, of, general, relativity, however, are, beyond, newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, in, classical, physics, these, predictions, concern, the, passage, of, time, the, geometry, of, space, the, motion, of, bodies, in, free, fall, and, the, propagation, of, light, and, include, gravitational, time, dilation, gravitational, lensing, the, gravitational, redshift, of, light, the, shapiro, time, delay, and, singularities, black, holes, so, far, all, tests, of, general, relativity, have, been, shown, to, be, in, agreement, with, the, theory, the, time, dependent, solutions, of, general, relativity, enable, us, to, talk, about, the, history, of, the, universe, and, have, provided, the, modern, framework, for, cosmology, thus, leading, to, the, discovery, of, the, big, bang, and, cosmic, microwave, background, radiation, despite, the, introduction, of, a, number, of, alternative, theories, general, relativity, continues, to, be, the, simplest, theory, consistent, with, experimental, data, reconciliation, of, general, relativity, with, the, laws, of, quantum, physics, remains, a, problem, however, as, there, is, a, lack, of, a, self, consistent, theory, of, quantum, gravity, it, is, not, yet, known, how, gravity, can, be, unified, with, the, three, non, gravitational, forces, strong, weak, and, electromagnetic, einstein, s, theory, has, astrophysical, implications, including, the, prediction, of, black, holes, regions, of, space, in, which, space, and, time, are, distorted, in, such, a, way, that, nothing, not, even, light, can, escape, from, them, black, holes, are, the, end, state, for, massive, stars, microquasars, and, active, galactic, nuclei, are, believed, to, be, stellar, black, holes, and, supermassive, black, holes, it, also, predicts, gravitational, lensing, where, the, bending, of, light, results, in, multiple, images, of, the, same, distant, astronomical, phenomenon, other, predictions, include, the, existence, of, gravitational, waves, which, have, been, observed, directly, by, the, physics, collaboration, ligo, and, other, observatories, in, addition, general, relativity, has, provided, the, base, of, cosmological, models, of, an, expanding, universe, widely, acknowledged, as, a, theory, of, extraordinary, beauty, general, relativity, has, often, been, described, as, the, most, beautiful, of, all, existing, physical, theories, henri, poincar, s, 1905, theory, of, the, dynamics, of, the, electron, was, a, relativistic, theory, which, he, applied, to, all, forces, including, gravity, while, others, thought, that, gravity, was, instantaneous, or, of, electromagnetic, origin, he, suggested, that, relativity, was, something, due, to, our, methods, of, measurement, in, his, theory, he, showed, that, gravitational, waves, propagate, at, the, speed, of, light, soon, afterwards, einstein, started, thinking, about, how, to, incorporate, gravity, into, his, relativistic, framework, in, 1907, beginning, with, a, simple, thought, experiment, involving, an, observer, in, free, fall, ffo, he, embarked, on, what, would, be, an, eight, year, search, for, a, relativistic, theory, of, gravity, after, numerous, detours, and, false, starts, his, work, culminated, in, the, presentation, to, the, prussian, academy, of, science, in, november, 1915, of, what, are, now, known, as, the, einstein, field, equations, which, form, the, core, of, einstein, s, general, theory, of, relativity, these, equations, specify, how, the, geometry, of, space, and, time, is, influenced, by, whatever, matter, and, radiation, are, present, a, version, of, non, euclidean, geometry, called, riemannian, geometry, enabled, einstein, to, develop, general, relativity, by, providing, the, key, mathematical, framework, on, which, he, fit, his, physical, ideas, of, gravity, this, idea, was, pointed, out, by, mathematician, marcel, grossmann, and, published, by, grossmann, and, einstein, in, 1913, the, einstein, field, equations, are, nonlinear, and, considered, difficult, to, solve, einstein, used, approximation, methods, in, working, out, initial, predictions, of, the, theory, but, in, 1916, the, astrophysicist, karl, schwarzschild, found, the, first, non, trivial, exact, solution, to, the, einstein, field, equations, the, schwarzschild, metric, this, solution, laid, the, groundwork, for, the, description, of, the, final, stages, of, gravitational, collapse, and, the, objects, known, today, as, black, holes, in, the, same, year, the, first, steps, towards, generalizing, schwarzschild, s, solution, to, electrically, charged, objects, were, taken, eventually, resulting, in, the, reissner, nordstr, m, solution, which, is, now, associated, with, electrically, charged, black, holes, in, 1917, einstein, applied, his, theory, to, the, universe, as, a, whole, initiating, the, field, of, relativistic, cosmology, in, line, with, contemporary, thinking, he, assumed, a, static, universe, adding, a, new, parameter, to, his, original, field, equations, the, cosmological, constant, to, match, that, observational, presumption, by, 1929, however, the, work, of, hubble, and, others, had, shown, that, our, universe, is, expanding, this, is, readily, described, by, the, expanding, cosmological, solutions, found, by, friedmann, in, 1922, which, do, not, require, a, cosmological, constant, lema, tre, used, these, solutions, to, formulate, the, earliest, version, of, the, big, bang, models, in, which, our, universe, has, evolved, from, an, extremely, hot, and, dense, earlier, state, einstein, later, declared, the, cosmological, constant, the, biggest, blunder, of, his, life, during, that, period, general, relativity, remained, something, of, a, curiosity, among, physical, theories, it, was, clearly, superior, to, newtonian, gravity, being, consistent, with, special, relativity, and, accounting, for, several, effects, unexplained, by, the, newtonian, theory, einstein, showed, in, 1915, how, his, theory, explained, the, anomalous, perihelion, advance, of, the, planet, mercury, without, any, arbitrary, parameters, fudge, factors, and, in, 1919, an, expedition, led, by, eddington, confirmed, general, relativity, s, prediction, for, the, deflection, of, starlight, by, the, sun, during, the, total, solar, eclipse, of, 29, may, 1919, instantly, making, einstein, famous, yet, the, theory, remained, outside, the, mainstream, of, theoretical, physics, and, astrophysics, until, developments, between, approximately, 1960, and, 1975, now, known, as, the, golden, age, of, general, relativity, physicists, began, to, understand, the, concept, of, a, black, hole, and, to, identify, quasars, as, one, of, these, objects, astrophysical, manifestations, ever, more, precise, solar, system, tests, confirmed, the, theory, s, predictive, power, and, relativistic, cosmology, also, became, amenable, to, direct, observational, tests, general, relativity, has, acquired, a, reputation, as, a, theory, of, extraordinary, beauty, subrahmanyan, chandrasekhar, has, noted, that, at, multiple, levels, general, relativity, exhibits, what, francis, bacon, has, termed, a, strangeness, in, the, proportion, i, e, elements, that, excite, wonderment, and, surprise, it, juxtaposes, fundamental, concepts, space, and, time, versus, matter, and, motion, which, had, previously, been, considered, as, entirely, independent, chandrasekhar, also, noted, that, einstein, s, only, guides, in, his, search, for, an, exact, theory, were, the, principle, of, equivalence, and, his, sense, that, a, proper, description, of, gravity, should, be, geometrical, at, its, basis, so, that, there, was, an, element, of, revelation, in, the, manner, in, which, einstein, arrived, at, his, theory, other, elements, of, beauty, associated, with, the, general, theory, of, relativity, are, its, simplicity, and, symmetry, the, manner, in, which, it, incorporates, invariance, and, unification, and, its, perfect, logical, consistency, in, the, preface, to, relativity, the, special, and, the, general, theory, einstein, said, the, present, book, is, intended, as, far, as, possible, to, give, an, exact, insight, into, the, theory, of, relativity, to, those, readers, who, from, a, general, scientific, and, philosophical, point, of, view, are, interested, in, the, theory, but, who, are, not, conversant, with, the, mathematical, apparatus, of, theoretical, physics, the, work, presumes, a, standard, of, education, corresponding, to, that, of, a, university, matriculation, examination, and, despite, the, shortness, of, the, book, a, fair, amount, of, patience, and, force, of, will, on, the, part, of, the, reader, the, author, has, spared, himself, no, pains, in, his, endeavour, to, present, the, main, ideas, in, the, simplest, and, most, intelligible, form, and, on, the, whole, in, the, sequence, and, connection, in, which, they, actually, originated, general, relativity, can, be, understood, by, examining, its, similarities, with, and, departures, from, classical, physics, the, first, step, is, the, realization, that, classical, mechanics, and, newton, s, law, of, gravity, admit, a, geometric, description, the, combination, of, this, description, with, the, laws, of, special, relativity, results, in, a, heuristic, derivation, of, general, relativity, at, the, base, of, classical, mechanics, is, the, notion, that, a, body, s, motion, can, be, described, as, a, combination, of, free, or, inertial, motion, and, deviations, from, this, free, motion, such, deviations, are, caused, by, external, forces, acting, on, a, body, in, accordance, with, newton, s, second, law, of, motion, which, states, that, the, net, force, acting, on, a, body, is, equal, to, that, body, s, inertial, mass, multiplied, by, its, acceleration, the, preferred, inertial, motions, are, related, to, the, geometry, of, space, and, time, in, the, standard, reference, frames, of, classical, mechanics, objects, in, free, motion, move, along, straight, lines, at, constant, speed, in, modern, parlance, their, paths, are, geodesics, straight, world, lines, in, curved, spacetime, conversely, one, might, expect, that, inertial, motions, once, identified, by, observing, the, actual, motions, of, bodies, and, making, allowances, for, the, external, forces, such, as, electromagnetism, or, friction, can, be, used, to, define, the, geometry, of, space, as, well, as, a, time, coordinate, however, there, is, an, ambiguity, once, gravity, comes, into, play, according, to, newton, s, law, of, gravity, and, independently, verified, by, experiments, such, as, that, of, e, tv, s, and, its, successors, see, e, tv, s, experiment, there, is, a, universality, of, free, fall, also, known, as, the, weak, equivalence, principle, or, the, universal, equality, of, inertial, and, passive, gravitational, mass, the, trajectory, of, a, test, body, in, free, fall, depends, only, on, its, position, and, initial, speed, but, not, on, any, of, its, material, properties, a, simplified, version, of, this, is, embodied, in, einstein, s, elevator, experiment, illustrated, in, the, figure, on, the, right, for, an, observer, in, an, enclosed, room, it, is, impossible, to, decide, by, mapping, the, trajectory, of, bodies, such, as, a, dropped, ball, whether, the, room, is, stationary, in, a, gravitational, field, and, the, ball, accelerating, or, in, free, space, aboard, a, rocket, that, is, accelerating, at, a, rate, equal, to, that, of, the, gravitational, field, versus, the, ball, which, upon, release, has, nil, acceleration, given, the, universality, of, free, fall, there, is, no, observable, distinction, between, inertial, motion, and, motion, under, the, influence, of, the, gravitational, force, this, suggests, the, definition, of, a, new, class, of, inertial, motion, namely, that, of, objects, in, free, fall, under, the, influence, of, gravity, this, new, class, of, preferred, motions, too, defines, a, geometry, of, space, and, time, in, mathematical, terms, it, is, the, geodesic, motion, associated, with, a, specific, connection, which, depends, on, the, gradient, of, the, gravitational, potential, space, in, this, construction, still, has, the, ordinary, euclidean, geometry, however, space, time, as, a, whole, is, more, complicated, as, can, be, shown, using, simple, thought, experiments, following, the, free, fall, trajectories, of, different, test, particles, the, result, of, transporting, spacetime, vectors, that, can, denote, a, particle, s, velocity, time, like, vectors, will, vary, with, the, particle, s, trajectory, mathematically, speaking, the, newtonian, connection, is, not, integrable, from, this, one, can, deduce, that, spacetime, is, curved, the, resulting, newton, cartan, theory, is, a, geometric, formulation, of, newtonian, gravity, using, only, covariant, concepts, i, e, a, description, which, is, valid, in, any, desired, coordinate, system, in, this, geometric, description, tidal, effects, the, relative, acceleration, of, bodies, in, free, fall, are, related, to, the, derivative, of, the, connection, showing, how, the, modified, geometry, is, caused, by, the, presence, of, mass, as, intriguing, as, geometric, newtonian, gravity, may, be, its, basis, classical, mechanics, is, merely, a, limiting, case, of, special, relativistic, mechanics, in, the, language, of, symmetry, where, gravity, can, be, neglected, physics, is, lorentz, invariant, as, in, special, relativity, rather, than, galilei, invariant, as, in, classical, mechanics, the, defining, symmetry, of, special, relativity, is, the, poincar, group, which, includes, translations, rotations, boosts, and, reflections, the, differences, between, the, two, become, significant, when, dealing, with, speeds, approaching, the, speed, of, light, and, with, high, energy, phenomena, with, lorentz, symmetry, additional, structures, come, into, play, they, are, defined, by, the, set, of, light, cones, see, image, the, light, cones, define, a, causal, structure, for, each, event, a, there, is, a, set, of, events, that, can, in, principle, either, influence, or, be, influenced, by, a, via, signals, or, interactions, that, do, not, need, to, travel, faster, than, light, such, as, event, b, in, the, image, and, a, set, of, events, for, which, such, an, influence, is, impossible, such, as, event, c, in, the, image, these, sets, are, observer, independent, in, conjunction, with, the, world, lines, of, freely, falling, particles, the, light, cones, can, be, used, to, reconstruct, the, spacetime, s, semi, riemannian, metric, at, least, up, to, a, positive, scalar, factor, in, mathematical, terms, this, defines, a, conformal, structure, or, conformal, geometry, special, relativity, is, defined, in, the, absence, of, gravity, for, practical, applications, it, is, a, suitable, model, whenever, gravity, can, be, neglected, bringing, gravity, into, play, and, assuming, the, universality, of, free, fall, motion, an, analogous, reasoning, as, in, the, previous, section, applies, there, are, no, global, inertial, frames, instead, there, are, approximate, inertial, frames, moving, alongside, freely, falling, particles, translated, into, the, language, of, spacetime, the, straight, time, like, lines, that, define, a, gravity, free, inertial, frame, are, deformed, to, lines, that, are, curved, relative, to, each, other, suggesting, that, the, inclusion, of, gravity, necessitates, a, change, in, spacetime, geometry, a, priori, it, is, not, clear, whether, the, new, local, frames, in, free, fall, coincide, with, the, reference, frames, in, which, the, laws, of, special, relativity, hold, that, theory, is, based, on, the, propagation, of, light, and, thus, on, electromagnetism, which, could, have, a, different, set, of, preferred, frames, but, using, different, assumptions, about, the, special, relativistic, frames, such, as, their, being, earth, fixed, or, in, free, fall, one, can, derive, different, predictions, for, the, gravitational, redshift, that, is, the, way, in, which, the, frequency, of, light, shifts, as, the, light, propagates, through, a, gravitational, field, cf, below, the, actual, measurements, show, that, free, falling, frames, are, the, ones, in, which, light, propagates, as, it, does, in, special, relativity, the, generalization, of, this, statement, namely, that, the, laws, of, special, relativity, hold, to, good, approximation, in, freely, falling, and, non, rotating, reference, frames, is, known, as, the, einstein, equivalence, principle, a, crucial, guiding, principle, for, generalizing, special, relativistic, physics, to, include, gravity, the, same, experimental, data, shows, that, time, as, measured, by, clocks, in, a, gravitational, field, proper, time, to, give, the, technical, term, does, not, follow, the, rules, of, special, relativity, in, the, language, of, spacetime, geometry, it, is, not, measured, by, the, minkowski, metric, as, in, the, newtonian, case, this, is, suggestive, of, a, more, general, geometry, at, small, scales, all, reference, frames, that, are, in, free, fall, are, equivalent, and, approximately, minkowskian, consequently, we, are, now, dealing, with, a, curved, generalization, of, minkowski, space, the, metric, tensor, that, defines, the, geometry, in, particular, how, lengths, and, angles, are, measured, is, not, the, minkowski, metric, of, special, relativity, it, is, a, generalization, known, as, a, semi, or, pseudo, riemannian, metric, furthermore, each, riemannian, metric, is, naturally, associated, with, one, particular, kind, of, connection, the, levi, civita, connection, and, this, is, in, fact, the, connection, that, satisfies, the, equivalence, principle, and, makes, space, locally, minkowskian, that, is, in, suitable, locally, inertial, coordinates, the, metric, is, minkowskian, and, its, first, partial, derivatives, and, the, connection, coefficients, vanish, having, formulated, the, relativistic, geometric, version, of, the, effects, of, gravity, the, question, of, gravity, s, source, remains, in, newtonian, gravity, the, source, is, mass, in, special, relativity, mass, turns, out, to, be, part, of, a, more, general, quantity, called, the, energy, momentum, tensor, which, includes, both, energy, and, momentum, densities, as, well, as, stress, pressure, and, shear, using, the, equivalence, principle, this, tensor, is, readily, generalized, to, curved, spacetime, drawing, further, upon, the, analogy, with, geometric, newtonian, gravity, it, is, natural, to, assume, that, the, field, equation, for, gravity, relates, this, tensor, and, the, ricci, tensor, which, describes, a, particular, class, of, tidal, effects, the, change, in, volume, for, a, small, cloud, of, test, particles, that, are, initially, at, rest, and, then, fall, freely, in, special, relativity, conservation, of, energy, momentum, corresponds, to, the, statement, that, the, energy, momentum, tensor, is, divergence, free, this, formula, too, is, readily, generalized, to, curved, spacetime, by, replacing, partial, derivatives, with, their, curved, manifold, counterparts, covariant, derivatives, studied, in, differential, geometry, with, this, additional, condition, the, covariant, divergence, of, the, energy, momentum, tensor, and, hence, of, whatever, is, on, the, other, side, of, the, equation, is, zero, the, simplest, nontrivial, set, of, equations, are, what, are, called, einstein, s, field, equations, g, r, 1, 2, r, g, t, displaystyle, g, mu, nu, equiv, r, mu, nu, textstyle, 1, over, 2, r, g, mu, nu, kappa, t, mu, nu, on, the, left, hand, side, is, the, einstein, tensor, g, displaystyle, g, mu, nu, which, is, symmetric, and, a, specific, divergence, free, combination, of, the, ricci, tensor, r, displaystyle, r, mu, nu, and, the, metric, in, particular, is, the, curvature, scalar, the, ricci, tensor, itself, is, related, to, the, more, general, riemann, curvature, tensor, as, on, the, right, hand, side, displaystyle, kappa, is, a, constant, and, t, displaystyle, t, mu, nu, is, the, energy, momentum, tensor, all, tensors, are, written, in, abstract, index, notation, matching, the, theory, s, prediction, to, observational, results, for, planetary, orbits, or, equivalently, assuring, that, the, weak, gravity, low, speed, limit, is, newtonian, mechanics, the, proportionality, constant, displaystyle, kappa, is, found, to, be, 8, g, c, 4, textstyle, kappa, frac, 8, pi, g, c, 4, where, g, displaystyle, g, is, the, newtonian, constant, of, gravitation, and, c, displaystyle, c, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, when, there, is, no, matter, present, so, that, the, energy, momentum, tensor, vanishes, the, results, are, the, vacuum, einstein, equations, in, general, relativity, the, world, line, of, a, particle, free, from, all, external, non, gravitational, force, is, a, particular, type, of, geodesic, in, curved, spacetime, in, other, words, a, freely, moving, or, falling, particle, always, moves, along, a, geodesic, the, geodesic, equation, is, where, s, displaystyle, s, is, a, scalar, parameter, of, motion, e, g, the, proper, time, and, displaystyle, gamma, mu, alpha, beta, are, christoffel, symbols, sometimes, called, the, affine, connection, coefficients, or, levi, civita, connection, coefficients, which, is, symmetric, in, the, two, lower, indices, greek, indices, may, take, the, values, 0, 1, 2, 3, and, the, summation, convention, is, used, for, repeated, indices, displaystyle, alpha, and, displaystyle, beta, the, quantity, on, the, left, hand, side, of, this, equation, is, the, acceleration, of, a, particle, and, so, this, equation, is, analogous, to, newton, s, laws, of, motion, which, likewise, provide, formulae, for, the, acceleration, of, a, particle, this, equation, of, motion, employs, the, einstein, notation, meaning, that, repeated, indices, are, summed, i, e, from, zero, to, three, the, christoffel, symbols, are, functions, of, the, four, spacetime, coordinates, and, so, are, independent, of, the, velocity, or, acceleration, or, other, characteristics, of, a, test, particle, whose, motion, is, described, by, the, geodesic, equation, in, general, relativity, the, effective, gravitational, potential, energy, of, an, object, of, mass, m, revolving, around, a, massive, central, body, m, is, given, by, a, conservative, total, force, can, then, be, obtained, as, its, negative, gradient, where, l, is, the, angular, momentum, the, first, term, represents, the, force, of, newtonian, gravity, which, is, described, by, the, inverse, square, law, the, second, term, represents, the, centrifugal, force, in, the, circular, motion, the, third, term, represents, the, relativistic, effect, there, are, alternatives, to, general, relativity, built, upon, the, same, premises, which, include, additional, rules, and, or, constraints, leading, to, different, field, equations, examples, are, whitehead, s, theory, brans, dicke, theory, teleparallelism, f, r, gravity, and, einstein, cartan, theory, the, derivation, outlined, in, the, previous, section, contains, all, the, information, needed, to, define, general, relativity, describe, its, key, properties, and, address, a, question, of, crucial, importance, in, physics, namely, how, the, theory, can, be, used, for, model, building, general, relativity, is, a, metric, theory, of, gravitation, at, its, core, are, einstein, s, equations, which, describe, the, relation, between, the, geometry, of, a, four, dimensional, pseudo, riemannian, manifold, representing, spacetime, and, the, energy, momentum, contained, in, that, spacetime, phenomena, that, in, classical, mechanics, are, ascribed, to, the, action, of, the, force, of, gravity, such, as, free, fall, orbital, motion, and, spacecraft, trajectories, correspond, to, inertial, motion, within, a, curved, geometry, of, spacetime, in, general, relativity, there, is, no, gravitational, force, deflecting, objects, from, their, natural, straight, paths, instead, gravity, corresponds, to, changes, in, the, properties, of, space, and, time, which, in, turn, changes, the, straightest, possible, paths, that, objects, will, naturally, follow, the, curvature, is, in, turn, caused, by, the, energy, momentum, of, matter, paraphrasing, the, relativist, john, archibald, wheeler, spacetime, tells, matter, how, to, move, matter, tells, spacetime, how, to, curve, while, general, relativity, replaces, the, scalar, gravitational, potential, of, classical, physics, by, a, symmetric, rank, two, tensor, the, latter, reduces, to, the, former, in, certain, limiting, cases, for, weak, gravitational, fields, and, slow, speed, relative, to, the, speed, of, light, the, theory, s, predictions, converge, on, those, of, newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, as, it, is, constructed, using, tensors, general, relativity, exhibits, general, covariance, its, laws, and, further, laws, formulated, within, the, general, relativistic, framework, take, on, the, same, form, in, all, coordinate, systems, furthermore, the, theory, does, not, contain, any, invariant, geometric, background, structures, i, e, it, is, background, independent, it, thus, satisfies, a, more, stringent, general, principle, of, relativity, namely, that, the, laws, of, physics, are, the, same, for, all, observers, locally, as, expressed, in, the, equivalence, principle, spacetime, is, minkowskian, and, the, laws, of, physics, exhibit, local, lorentz, invariance, the, core, concept, of, general, relativistic, model, building, is, that, of, a, solution, of, einstein, s, equations, given, both, einstein, s, equations, and, suitable, equations, for, the, properties, of, matter, such, a, solution, consists, of, a, specific, semi, riemannian, manifold, usually, defined, by, giving, the, metric, in, specific, coordinates, and, specific, matter, fields, defined, on, that, manifold, matter, and, geometry, must, satisfy, einstein, s, equations, so, in, particular, the, matter, s, energy, momentum, tensor, must, be, divergence, free, the, matter, must, of, course, also, satisfy, whatever, additional, equations, were, imposed, on, its, properties, in, short, such, a, solution, is, a, model, universe, that, satisfies, the, laws, of, general, relativity, and, possibly, additional, laws, governing, whatever, matter, might, be, present, einstein, s, equations, are, nonlinear, partial, differential, equations, and, as, such, difficult, to, solve, exactly, nevertheless, a, number, of, exact, solutions, are, known, although, only, a, few, have, direct, physical, applications, the, best, known, exact, solutions, and, also, those, most, interesting, from, a, physics, point, of, view, are, the, schwarzschild, solution, the, reissner, nordstr, m, solution, and, the, kerr, metric, each, corresponding, to, a, certain, type, of, black, hole, in, an, otherwise, empty, universe, and, the, friedmann, lema, tre, robertson, walker, and, de, sitter, universes, each, describing, an, expanding, cosmos, exact, solutions, of, great, theoretical, interest, include, the, g, del, universe, which, opens, up, the, intriguing, possibility, of, time, travel, in, curved, spacetimes, the, taub, nut, solution, a, model, universe, that, is, homogeneous, but, anisotropic, and, anti, de, sitter, space, which, has, recently, come, to, prominence, in, the, context, of, what, is, called, the, maldacena, conjecture, given, the, difficulty, of, finding, exact, solutions, einstein, s, field, equations, are, also, solved, frequently, by, numerical, integration, on, a, computer, or, by, considering, small, perturbations, of, exact, solutions, in, the, field, of, numerical, relativity, powerful, computers, are, employed, to, simulate, the, geometry, of, spacetime, and, to, solve, einstein, s, equations, for, interesting, situations, such, as, two, colliding, black, holes, in, principle, such, methods, may, be, applied, to, any, system, given, sufficient, computer, resources, and, may, address, fundamental, questions, such, as, naked, singularities, approximate, solutions, may, also, be, found, by, perturbation, theories, such, as, linearized, gravity, and, its, generalization, the, post, newtonian, expansion, both, of, which, were, developed, by, einstein, the, latter, provides, a, systematic, approach, to, solving, for, the, geometry, of, a, spacetime, that, contains, a, distribution, of, matter, that, moves, slowly, compared, with, the, speed, of, light, the, expansion, involves, a, series, of, terms, the, first, terms, represent, newtonian, gravity, whereas, the, later, terms, represent, ever, smaller, corrections, to, newton, s, theory, due, to, general, relativity, an, extension, of, this, expansion, is, the, parametrized, post, newtonian, ppn, formalism, which, allows, quantitative, comparisons, between, the, predictions, of, general, relativity, and, alternative, theories, general, relativity, has, a, number, of, physical, consequences, some, follow, directly, from, the, theory, s, axioms, whereas, others, have, become, clear, only, in, the, course, of, many, years, of, research, that, followed, einstein, s, initial, publication, assuming, that, the, equivalence, principle, holds, gravity, influences, the, passage, of, time, light, sent, down, into, a, gravity, well, is, blueshifted, whereas, light, sent, in, the, opposite, direction, i, e, climbing, out, of, the, gravity, well, is, redshifted, collectively, these, two, effects, are, known, as, the, gravitational, frequency, shift, more, generally, processes, close, to, a, massive, body, run, more, slowly, when, compared, with, processes, taking, place, farther, away, this, effect, is, known, as, gravitational, time, dilation, gravitational, redshift, has, been, measured, in, the, laboratory, and, using, astronomical, observations, gravitational, time, dilation, in, the, earth, s, gravitational, field, has, been, measured, numerous, times, using, atomic, clocks, while, ongoing, validation, is, provided, as, a, side, effect, of, the, operation, of, the, global, positioning, system, gps, tests, in, stronger, gravitational, fields, are, provided, by, the, observation, of, binary, pulsars, all, results, are, in, agreement, with, general, relativity, however, at, the, current, level, of, accuracy, these, observations, cannot, distinguish, between, general, relativity, and, other, theories, in, which, the, equivalence, principle, is, valid, general, relativity, predicts, that, the, path, of, light, will, follow, the, curvature, of, spacetime, as, it, passes, near, a, star, this, effect, was, initially, confirmed, by, observing, the, light, of, stars, or, distant, quasars, being, deflected, as, it, passes, the, sun, this, and, related, predictions, follow, from, the, fact, that, light, follows, what, is, called, a, light, like, or, null, geodesic, a, generalization, of, the, straight, lines, along, which, light, travels, in, classical, physics, such, geodesics, are, the, generalization, of, the, invariance, of, lightspeed, in, special, relativity, as, one, examines, suitable, model, spacetimes, either, the, exterior, schwarzschild, solution, or, for, more, than, a, single, mass, the, post, newtonian, expansion, several, effects, of, gravity, on, light, propagation, emerge, although, the, bending, of, light, can, also, be, derived, by, extending, the, universality, of, free, fall, to, light, the, angle, of, deflection, resulting, from, such, calculations, is, only, half, the, value, given, by, general, relativity, closely, related, to, light, deflection, is, the, shapiro, time, delay, the, phenomenon, that, light, signals, take, longer, to, move, through, a, gravitational, field, than, they, would, in, the, absence, of, that, field, there, have, been, numerous, successful, tests, of, this, prediction, in, the, parameterized, post, newtonian, formalism, ppn, measurements, of, both, the, deflection, of, light, and, the, gravitational, time, delay, determine, a, parameter, called, which, encodes, the, influence, of, gravity, on, the, geometry, of, space, predicted, in, 1916, by, albert, einstein, there, are, gravitational, waves, ripples, in, the, metric, of, spacetime, that, propagate, at, the, speed, of, light, these, are, one, of, several, analogies, between, weak, field, gravity, and, electromagnetism, in, that, they, are, analogous, to, electromagnetic, waves, on, 11, february, 2016, the, advanced, ligo, team, announced, that, they, had, directly, detected, gravitational, waves, from, a, pair, of, black, holes, merging, the, simplest, type, of, such, a, wave, can, be, visualized, by, its, action, on, a, ring, of, freely, floating, particles, a, sine, wave, propagating, through, such, a, ring, towards, the, reader, distorts, the, ring, in, a, characteristic, rhythmic, fashion, animated, image, to, the, right, since, einstein, s, equations, are, non, linear, arbitrarily, strong, gravitational, waves, do, not, obey, linear, superposition, making, their, description, difficult, however, linear, approximations, of, gravitational, waves, are, sufficiently, accurate, to, describe, the, exceedingly, weak, waves, that, are, expected, to, arrive, here, on, earth, from, far, off, cosmic, events, which, typically, result, in, relative, distances, increasing, and, decreasing, by, 10, 21, displaystyle, 10, 21, or, less, data, analysis, methods, routinely, make, use, of, the, fact, that, these, linearized, waves, can, be, fourier, decomposed, some, exact, solutions, describe, gravitational, waves, without, any, approximation, e, g, a, wave, train, traveling, through, empty, space, or, gowdy, universes, varieties, of, an, expanding, cosmos, filled, with, gravitational, waves, but, for, gravitational, waves, produced, in, astrophysically, relevant, situations, such, as, the, merger, of, two, black, holes, numerical, methods, are, presently, the, only, way, to, construct, appropriate, models, general, relativity, differs, from, classical, mechanics, in, a, number, of, predictions, concerning, orbiting, bodies, it, predicts, an, overall, rotation, precession, of, planetary, orbits, as, well, as, orbital, decay, caused, by, the, emission, of, gravitational, waves, and, effects, related, to, the, relativity, of, direction, in, general, relativity, the, apsides, of, any, orbit, the, point, of, the, orbiting, body, s, closest, approach, to, the, system, s, center, of, mass, will, precess, the, orbit, is, not, an, ellipse, but, akin, to, an, ellipse, that, rotates, on, its, focus, resulting, in, a, rose, curve, like, shape, see, image, einstein, first, derived, this, result, by, using, an, approximate, metric, representing, the, newtonian, limit, and, treating, the, orbiting, body, as, a, test, particle, for, him, the, fact, that, his, theory, gave, a, straightforward, explanation, of, mercury, s, anomalous, perihelion, shift, discovered, earlier, by, urbain, le, verrier, in, 1859, was, important, evidence, that, he, had, at, last, identified, the, correct, form, of, the, gravitational, field, equations, the, effect, can, also, be, derived, by, using, either, the, exact, schwarzschild, metric, describing, spacetime, around, a, spherical, mass, or, the, much, more, general, post, newtonian, formalism, it, is, due, to, the, influence, of, gravity, on, the, geometry, of, space, and, to, the, contribution, of, self, energy, to, a, body, s, gravity, encoded, in, the, nonlinearity, of, einstein, s, equations, relativistic, precession, has, been, observed, for, all, planets, that, allow, for, accurate, precession, measurements, mercury, venus, and, earth, as, well, as, in, binary, pulsar, systems, where, it, is, larger, by, five, orders, of, magnitude, in, general, relativity, the, perihelion, shift, displaystyle, sigma, expressed, in, radians, per, revolution, is, approximately, given, by, where, according, to, general, relativity, a, binary, system, will, emit, gravitational, waves, thereby, losing, energy, due, to, this, loss, the, distance, between, the, two, orbiting, bodies, decreases, and, so, does, their, orbital, period, within, the, solar, system, or, for, ordinary, double, stars, the, effect, is, too, small, to, be, observable, this, is, not, the, case, for, a, close, binary, pulsar, a, system, of, two, orbiting, neutron, stars, one, of, which, is, a, pulsar, from, the, pulsar, observers, on, earth, receive, a, regular, series, of, radio, pulses, that, can, serve, as, a, highly, accurate, clock, which, allows, precise, measurements, of, the, orbital, period, because, neutron, stars, are, immensely, compact, significant, amounts, of, energy, are, emitted, in, the, form, of, gravitational, radiation, the, first, observation, of, a, decrease, in, orbital, period, due, to, the, emission, of, gravitational, waves, was, made, by, hulse, and, taylor, using, the, binary, pulsar, psr1913, 16, they, had, discovered, in, 1974, this, was, the, first, detection, of, gravitational, waves, albeit, indirect, for, which, they, were, awarded, the, 1993, nobel, prize, in, physics, since, then, several, other, binary, pulsars, have, been, found, in, particular, the, double, pulsar, psr, j0737, 3039, where, both, stars, are, pulsars, and, which, was, last, reported, to, also, be, in, agreement, with, general, relativity, in, 2021, after, 16, years, of, observations, several, relativistic, effects, are, directly, related, to, the, relativity, of, direction, one, is, geodetic, precession, the, axis, direction, of, a, gyroscope, in, free, fall, in, curved, spacetime, will, change, when, compared, for, instance, with, the, direction, of, light, received, from, distant, stars, even, though, such, a, gyroscope, represents, the, way, of, keeping, a, direction, as, stable, as, possible, parallel, transport, for, the, moon, earth, system, this, effect, has, been, measured, with, the, help, of, lunar, laser, ranging, more, recently, it, has, been, measured, for, test, masses, aboard, the, satellite, gravity, probe, b, to, a, precision, of, better, than, 0, 3, near, a, rotating, mass, there, are, gravitomagnetic, or, frame, dragging, effects, a, distant, observer, will, determine, that, objects, close, to, the, mass, get, dragged, around, this, is, most, extreme, for, rotating, black, holes, where, for, any, object, entering, a, zone, known, as, the, ergosphere, rotation, is, inevitable, such, effects, can, again, be, tested, through, their, influence, on, the, orientation, of, gyroscopes, in, free, fall, somewhat, controversial, tests, have, been, performed, using, the, lageos, satellites, confirming, the, relativistic, prediction, also, the, mars, global, surveyor, probe, around, mars, has, been, used, the, deflection, of, light, by, gravity, is, responsible, for, a, new, class, of, astronomical, phenomena, if, a, massive, object, is, situated, between, the, astronomer, and, a, distant, target, object, with, appropriate, mass, and, relative, distances, the, astronomer, will, see, multiple, distorted, images, of, the, target, such, effects, are, known, as, gravitational, lensing, depending, on, the, configuration, scale, and, mass, distribution, there, can, be, two, or, more, images, a, bright, ring, known, as, an, einstein, ring, or, partial, rings, called, arcs, the, earliest, example, was, discovered, in, 1979, since, then, more, than, a, hundred, gravitational, lenses, have, been, observed, even, if, the, multiple, images, are, too, close, to, each, other, to, be, resolved, the, effect, can, still, be, measured, e, g, as, an, overall, brightening, of, the, target, object, a, number, of, such, microlensing, events, have, been, observed, gravitational, lensing, has, developed, into, a, tool, of, observational, astronomy, it, is, used, to, detect, the, presence, and, distribution, of, dark, matter, provide, a, natural, telescope, for, observing, distant, galaxies, and, to, obtain, an, independent, estimate, of, the, hubble, constant, statistical, evaluations, of, lensing, data, provide, valuable, insight, into, the, structural, evolution, of, galaxies, observations, of, binary, pulsars, provide, strong, indirect, evidence, for, the, existence, of, gravitational, waves, see, orbital, decay, above, detection, of, these, waves, is, a, major, goal, of, current, relativity, related, research, several, land, based, gravitational, wave, detectors, are, currently, in, operation, most, notably, the, interferometric, detectors, geo, 600, ligo, two, detectors, tama, 300, and, virgo, various, pulsar, timing, arrays, are, using, millisecond, pulsars, to, detect, gravitational, waves, in, the, 10, 9, to, 10, 6, hertz, frequency, range, which, originate, from, binary, supermassive, blackholes, a, european, space, based, detector, elisa, ngo, is, currently, under, development, with, a, precursor, mission, lisa, pathfinder, having, launched, in, december, 2015, observations, of, gravitational, waves, promise, to, complement, observations, in, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, they, are, expected, to, yield, information, about, black, holes, and, other, dense, objects, such, as, neutron, stars, and, white, dwarfs, about, certain, kinds, of, supernova, implosions, and, about, processes, in, the, very, early, universe, including, the, signature, of, certain, types, of, hypothetical, cosmic, string, in, february, 2016, the, advanced, ligo, team, announced, that, they, had, detected, gravitational, waves, from, a, black, hole, merger, whenever, the, ratio, of, an, object, s, mass, to, its, radius, becomes, sufficiently, large, general, relativity, predicts, the, formation, of, a, black, hole, a, region, of, space, from, which, nothing, not, even, light, can, escape, in, the, currently, accepted, models, of, stellar, evolution, neutron, stars, of, around, 1, 4, solar, masses, and, stellar, black, holes, with, a, few, to, a, few, dozen, solar, masses, are, thought, to, be, the, final, state, for, the, evolution, of, massive, stars, usually, a, galaxy, has, one, supermassive, black, hole, with, a, few, million, to, a, few, billion, solar, masses, in, its, center, and, its, presence, is, thought, to, have, played, an, important, role, in, the, formation, of, the, galaxy, and, larger, cosmic, structures, astronomically, the, most, important, property, of, compact, objects, is, that, they, provide, a, supremely, efficient, mechanism, for, converting, gravitational, energy, into, electromagnetic, radiation, accretion, the, falling, of, dust, or, gaseous, matter, onto, stellar, or, supermassive, black, holes, is, thought, to, be, responsible, for, some, spectacularly, luminous, astronomical, objects, notably, diverse, kinds, of, active, galactic, nuclei, on, galactic, scales, and, stellar, size, objects, such, as, microquasars, in, particular, accretion, can, lead, to, relativistic, jets, focused, beams, of, highly, energetic, particles, that, are, being, flung, into, space, at, almost, light, speed, general, relativity, plays, a, central, role, in, modelling, all, these, phenomena, and, observations, provide, strong, evidence, for, the, existence, of, black, holes, with, the, properties, predicted, by, the, theory, black, holes, are, also, sought, after, targets, in, the, search, for, gravitational, waves, cf, gravitational, waves, above, merging, black, hole, binaries, should, lead, to, some, of, the, strongest, gravitational, wave, signals, reaching, detectors, here, on, earth, and, the, phase, directly, before, the, merger, chirp, could, be, used, as, a, standard, candle, to, deduce, the, distance, to, the, merger, events, and, hence, serve, as, a, probe, of, cosmic, expansion, at, large, distances, the, gravitational, waves, produced, as, a, stellar, black, hole, plunges, into, a, supermassive, one, should, provide, direct, information, about, the, supermassive, black, hole, s, geometry, the, current, models, of, cosmology, are, based, on, einstein, s, field, equations, which, include, the, cosmological, constant, displaystyle, lambda, since, it, has, important, influence, on, the, large, scale, dynamics, of, the, cosmos, where, g, displaystyle, g, mu, nu, is, the, spacetime, metric, isotropic, and, homogeneous, solutions, of, these, enhanced, equations, the, friedmann, lema, tre, robertson, walker, solutions, allow, physicists, to, model, a, universe, that, has, evolved, over, the, past, 14, billion, years, from, a, hot, early, big, bang, phase, once, a, small, number, of, parameters, for, example, the, universe, s, mean, matter, density, have, been, fixed, by, astronomical, observation, further, observational, data, can, be, used, to, put, the, models, to, the, test, predictions, all, successful, include, the, initial, abundance, of, chemical, elements, formed, in, a, period, of, primordial, nucleosynthesis, the, large, scale, structure, of, the, universe, and, the, existence, and, properties, of, a, thermal, echo, from, the, early, cosmos, the, cosmic, background, radiation, astronomical, observations, of, the, cosmological, expansion, rate, allow, the, total, amount, of, matter, in, the, universe, to, be, estimated, although, the, nature, of, that, matter, remains, mysterious, in, part, about, 90, of, all, matter, appears, to, be, dark, matter, which, has, mass, or, equivalently, gravitational, influence, but, does, not, interact, electromagnetically, and, hence, cannot, be, observed, directly, there, is, no, generally, accepted, description, of, this, new, kind, of, matter, within, the, framework, of, known, particle, physics, or, otherwise, observational, evidence, from, redshift, surveys, of, distant, supernovae, and, measurements, of, the, cosmic, background, radiation, also, show, that, the, evolution, of, our, universe, is, significantly, influenced, by, a, cosmological, constant, resulting, in, an, acceleration, of, cosmic, expansion, or, equivalently, by, a, form, of, energy, with, an, unusual, equation, of, state, known, as, dark, energy, the, nature, of, which, remains, unclear, an, inflationary, phase, an, additional, phase, of, strongly, accelerated, expansion, at, cosmic, times, of, around, 10, 33, seconds, was, hypothesized, in, 1980, to, account, for, several, puzzling, observations, that, were, unexplained, by, classical, cosmological, models, such, as, the, nearly, perfect, homogeneity, of, the, cosmic, background, radiation, recent, measurements, of, the, cosmic, background, radiation, have, resulted, in, the, first, evidence, for, this, scenario, however, there, is, a, bewildering, variety, of, possible, inflationary, scenarios, which, cannot, be, restricted, by, current, observations, an, even, larger, question, is, the, physics, of, the, earliest, universe, prior, to, the, inflationary, phase, and, close, to, where, the, classical, models, predict, the, big, bang, singularity, an, authoritative, answer, would, require, a, complete, theory, of, quantum, gravity, which, has, not, yet, been, developed, cf, the, section, on, quantum, gravity, below, kurt, g, del, showed, that, solutions, to, einstein, s, equations, exist, that, contain, closed, timelike, curves, ctcs, which, allow, for, loops, in, time, the, solutions, require, extreme, physical, conditions, unlikely, ever, to, occur, in, practice, and, it, remains, an, open, question, whether, further, laws, of, physics, will, eliminate, them, completely, since, then, other, similarly, impractical, gr, solutions, containing, ctcs, have, been, found, such, as, the, tipler, cylinder, and, traversable, wormholes, stephen, hawking, introduced, chronology, protection, conjecture, which, is, an, assumption, beyond, those, of, standard, general, relativity, to, prevent, time, travel, some, exact, solutions, in, general, relativity, such, as, alcubierre, drive, present, examples, of, warp, drive, but, these, solutions, requires, exotic, matter, distribution, and, generally, suffers, from, semiclassical, instability, the, spacetime, symmetry, group, for, special, relativity, is, the, poincar, group, which, is, a, ten, dimensional, group, of, three, lorentz, boosts, three, rotations, and, four, spacetime, translations, it, is, logical, to, ask, what, symmetries, if, any, might, apply, in, general, relativity, a, tractable, case, might, be, to, consider, the, symmetries, of, spacetime, as, seen, by, observers, located, far, away, from, all, sources, of, the, gravitational, field, the, naive, expectation, for, asymptotically, flat, spacetime, symmetries, might, be, simply, to, extend, and, reproduce, the, symmetries, of, flat, spacetime, of, special, relativity, viz, the, poincar, group, in, 1962, hermann, bondi, m, g, van, der, burg, a, w, metzner, and, rainer, k, sachs, addressed, this, asymptotic, symmetry, problem, in, order, to, investigate, the, flow, of, energy, at, infinity, due, to, propagating, gravitational, waves, their, first, step, was, to, decide, on, some, physically, sensible, boundary, conditions, to, place, on, the, gravitational, field, at, light, like, infinity, to, characterize, what, it, means, to, say, a, metric, is, asymptotically, flat, making, no, a, priori, assumptions, about, the, nature, of, the, asymptotic, symmetry, group, not, even, the, assumption, that, such, a, group, exists, then, after, designing, what, they, considered, to, be, the, most, sensible, boundary, conditions, they, investigated, the, nature, of, the, resulting, asymptotic, symmetry, transformations, that, leave, invariant, the, form, of, the, boundary, conditions, appropriate, for, asymptotically, flat, gravitational, fields, what, they, found, was, that, the, asymptotic, symmetry, transformations, actually, do, form, a, group, and, the, structure, of, this, group, does, not, depend, on, the, particular, gravitational, field, that, happens, to, be, present, this, means, that, as, expected, one, can, separate, the, kinematics, of, spacetime, from, the, dynamics, of, the, gravitational, field, at, least, at, spatial, infinity, the, puzzling, surprise, in, 1962, was, their, discovery, of, a, rich, infinite, dimensional, group, the, so, called, bms, group, as, the, asymptotic, symmetry, group, instead, of, the, finite, dimensional, poincar, group, which, is, a, subgroup, of, the, bms, group, not, only, are, the, lorentz, transformations, asymptotic, symmetry, transformations, there, are, also, additional, transformations, that, are, not, lorentz, transformations, but, are, asymptotic, symmetry, transformations, in, fact, they, found, an, additional, infinity, of, transformation, generators, known, as, supertranslations, this, implies, the, conclusion, that, general, relativity, gr, does, not, reduce, to, special, relativity, in, the, case, of, weak, fields, at, long, distances, it, turns, out, that, the, bms, symmetry, suitably, modified, could, be, seen, as, a, restatement, of, the, universal, soft, graviton, theorem, in, quantum, field, theory, qft, which, relates, universal, infrared, soft, qft, with, gr, asymptotic, spacetime, symmetries, in, general, relativity, no, material, body, can, catch, up, with, or, overtake, a, light, pulse, no, influence, from, an, event, a, can, reach, any, other, location, x, before, light, sent, out, at, a, to, x, in, consequence, an, exploration, of, all, light, worldlines, null, geodesics, yields, key, information, about, the, spacetime, s, causal, structure, this, structure, can, be, displayed, using, penrose, carter, diagrams, in, which, infinitely, large, regions, of, space, and, infinite, time, intervals, are, shrunk, compactified, so, as, to, fit, onto, a, finite, map, while, light, still, travels, along, diagonals, as, in, standard, spacetime, diagrams, aware, of, the, importance, of, causal, structure, roger, penrose, and, others, developed, what, is, known, as, global, geometry, in, global, geometry, the, object, of, study, is, not, one, particular, solution, or, family, of, solutions, to, einstein, s, equations, rather, relations, that, hold, true, for, all, geodesics, such, as, the, raychaudhuri, equation, and, additional, non, specific, assumptions, about, the, nature, of, matter, usually, in, the, form, of, energy, conditions, are, used, to, derive, general, results, using, global, geometry, some, spacetimes, can, be, shown, to, contain, boundaries, called, horizons, which, demarcate, one, region, from, the, rest, of, spacetime, the, best, known, examples, are, black, holes, if, mass, is, compressed, into, a, sufficiently, compact, region, of, space, as, specified, in, the, hoop, conjecture, the, relevant, length, scale, is, the, schwarzschild, radius, no, light, from, inside, can, escape, to, the, outside, since, no, object, can, overtake, a, light, pulse, all, interior, matter, is, imprisoned, as, well, passage, from, the, exterior, to, the, interior, is, still, possible, showing, that, the, boundary, the, black, hole, s, horizon, is, not, a, physical, barrier, early, studies, of, black, holes, relied, on, explicit, solutions, of, einstein, s, equations, notably, the, spherically, symmetric, schwarzschild, solution, used, to, describe, a, static, black, hole, and, the, axisymmetric, kerr, solution, used, to, describe, a, rotating, stationary, black, hole, and, introducing, interesting, features, such, as, the, ergosphere, using, global, geometry, later, studies, have, revealed, more, general, properties, of, black, holes, with, time, they, become, rather, simple, objects, characterized, by, eleven, parameters, specifying, electric, charge, mass, energy, linear, momentum, angular, momentum, and, location, at, a, specified, time, this, is, stated, by, the, black, hole, uniqueness, theorem, black, holes, have, no, hair, that, is, no, distinguishing, marks, like, the, hairstyles, of, humans, irrespective, of, the, complexity, of, a, gravitating, object, collapsing, to, form, a, black, hole, the, object, that, results, having, emitted, gravitational, waves, is, very, simple, even, more, remarkably, there, is, a, general, set, of, laws, known, as, black, hole, mechanics, which, is, analogous, to, the, laws, of, thermodynamics, for, instance, by, the, second, law, of, black, hole, mechanics, the, area, of, the, event, horizon, of, a, general, black, hole, will, never, decrease, with, time, analogous, to, the, entropy, of, a, thermodynamic, system, this, limits, the, energy, that, can, be, extracted, by, classical, means, from, a, rotating, black, hole, e, g, by, the, penrose, process, there, is, strong, evidence, that, the, laws, of, black, hole, mechanics, are, in, fact, a, subset, of, the, laws, of, thermodynamics, and, that, the, black, hole, area, is, proportional, to, its, entropy, this, leads, to, a, modification, of, the, original, laws, of, black, hole, mechanics, for, instance, as, the, second, law, of, black, hole, mechanics, becomes, part, of, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, it, is, possible, for, the, black, hole, area, to, decrease, as, long, as, other, processes, ensure, that, entropy, increases, overall, as, thermodynamical, objects, with, nonzero, temperature, black, holes, should, emit, thermal, radiation, semiclassical, calculations, indicate, that, indeed, they, do, with, the, surface, gravity, playing, the, role, of, temperature, in, planck, s, law, this, radiation, is, known, as, hawking, radiation, cf, the, quantum, theory, section, below, there, are, many, other, types, of, horizons, in, an, expanding, universe, an, observer, may, find, that, some, regions, of, the, past, cannot, be, observed, particle, horizon, and, some, regions, of, the, future, cannot, be, influenced, event, horizon, even, in, flat, minkowski, space, when, described, by, an, accelerated, observer, rindler, space, there, will, be, horizons, associated, with, a, semiclassical, radiation, known, as, unruh, radiation, another, general, feature, of, general, relativity, is, the, appearance, of, spacetime, boundaries, known, as, singularities, spacetime, can, be, explored, by, following, up, on, timelike, and, lightlike, geodesics, all, possible, ways, that, light, and, particles, in, free, fall, can, travel, but, some, solutions, of, einstein, s, equations, have, ragged, edges, regions, known, as, spacetime, singularities, where, the, paths, of, light, and, falling, particles, come, to, an, abrupt, end, and, geometry, becomes, ill, defined, in, the, more, interesting, cases, these, are, curvature, singularities, where, geometrical, quantities, characterizing, spacetime, curvature, such, as, the, ricci, scalar, take, on, infinite, values, well, known, examples, of, spacetimes, with, future, singularities, where, worldlines, end, are, the, schwarzschild, solution, which, describes, a, singularity, inside, an, eternal, static, black, hole, or, the, kerr, solution, with, its, ring, shaped, singularity, inside, an, eternal, rotating, black, hole, the, friedmann, lema, tre, robertson, walker, solutions, and, other, spacetimes, describing, universes, have, past, singularities, on, which, worldlines, begin, namely, big, bang, singularities, and, some, have, future, singularities, big, crunch, as, well, given, that, these, examples, are, all, highly, symmetric, and, thus, simplified, it, is, tempting, to, conclude, that, the, occurrence, of, singularities, is, an, artifact, of, idealization, the, famous, singularity, theorems, proved, using, the, methods, of, global, geometry, say, otherwise, singularities, are, a, generic, feature, of, general, relativity, and, unavoidable, once, the, collapse, of, an, object, with, realistic, matter, properties, has, proceeded, beyond, a, certain, stage, and, also, at, the, beginning, of, a, wide, class, of, expanding, universes, however, the, theorems, say, little, about, the, properties, of, singularities, and, much, of, current, research, is, devoted, to, characterizing, these, entities, generic, structure, hypothesized, e, g, by, the, bkl, conjecture, the, cosmic, censorship, hypothesis, states, that, all, realistic, future, singularities, no, perfect, symmetries, matter, with, realistic, properties, are, safely, hidden, away, behind, a, horizon, and, thus, invisible, to, all, distant, observers, while, no, formal, proof, yet, exists, numerical, simulations, offer, supporting, evidence, of, its, validity, each, solution, of, einstein, s, equation, encompasses, the, whole, history, of, a, universe, it, is, not, just, some, snapshot, of, how, things, are, but, a, whole, possibly, matter, filled, spacetime, it, describes, the, state, of, matter, and, geometry, everywhere, and, at, every, moment, in, that, particular, universe, due, to, its, general, covariance, einstein, s, theory, is, not, sufficient, by, itself, to, determine, the, time, evolution, of, the, metric, tensor, it, must, be, combined, with, a, coordinate, condition, which, is, analogous, to, gauge, fixing, in, other, field, theories, to, understand, einstein, s, equations, as, partial, differential, equations, it, is, helpful, to, formulate, them, in, a, way, that, describes, the, evolution, of, the, universe, over, time, this, is, done, in, 3, 1, formulations, where, spacetime, is, split, into, three, space, dimensions, and, one, time, dimension, the, best, known, example, is, the, adm, formalism, these, decompositions, show, that, the, spacetime, evolution, equations, of, general, relativity, are, well, behaved, solutions, always, exist, and, are, uniquely, defined, once, suitable, initial, conditions, have, been, specified, such, formulations, of, einstein, s, field, equations, are, the, basis, of, numerical, relativity, the, notion, of, evolution, equations, is, intimately, tied, in, with, another, aspect, of, general, relativistic, physics, in, einstein, s, theory, it, turns, out, to, be, impossible, to, find, a, general, definition, for, a, seemingly, simple, property, such, as, a, system, s, total, mass, or, energy, the, main, reason, is, that, the, gravitational, field, like, any, physical, field, must, be, ascribed, a, certain, energy, but, that, it, proves, to, be, fundamentally, impossible, to, localize, that, energy, nevertheless, there, are, possibilities, to, define, a, system, s, total, mass, either, using, a, hypothetical, infinitely, distant, observer, adm, mass, or, suitable, symmetries, komar, mass, if, one, excludes, from, the, system, s, total, mass, the, energy, being, carried, away, to, infinity, by, gravitational, waves, the, result, is, the, bondi, mass, at, null, infinity, just, as, in, classical, physics, it, can, be, shown, that, these, masses, are, positive, corresponding, global, definitions, exist, for, momentum, and, angular, momentum, there, have, also, been, a, number, of, attempts, to, define, quasi, local, quantities, such, as, the, mass, of, an, isolated, system, formulated, using, only, quantities, defined, within, a, finite, region, of, space, containing, that, system, the, hope, is, to, obtain, a, quantity, useful, for, general, statements, about, isolated, systems, such, as, a, more, precise, formulation, of, the, hoop, conjecture, if, general, relativity, were, considered, to, be, one, of, the, two, pillars, of, modern, physics, then, quantum, theory, the, basis, of, understanding, matter, from, elementary, particles, to, solid, state, physics, would, be, the, other, however, how, to, reconcile, quantum, theory, with, general, relativity, is, still, an, open, question, ordinary, quantum, field, theories, which, form, the, basis, of, modern, elementary, particle, physics, are, defined, in, flat, minkowski, space, which, is, an, excellent, approximation, when, it, comes, to, describing, the, behavior, of, microscopic, particles, in, weak, gravitational, fields, like, those, found, on, earth, in, order, to, describe, situations, in, which, gravity, is, strong, enough, to, influence, quantum, matter, yet, not, strong, enough, to, require, quantization, itself, physicists, have, formulated, quantum, field, theories, in, curved, spacetime, these, theories, rely, on, general, relativity, to, describe, a, curved, background, spacetime, and, define, a, generalized, quantum, field, theory, to, describe, the, behavior, of, quantum, matter, within, that, spacetime, using, this, formalism, it, can, be, shown, that, black, holes, emit, a, blackbody, spectrum, of, particles, known, as, hawking, radiation, leading, to, the, possibility, that, they, evaporate, over, time, as, briefly, mentioned, above, this, radiation, plays, an, important, role, for, the, thermodynamics, of, black, holes, the, demand, for, consistency, between, a, quantum, description, of, matter, and, a, geometric, description, of, spacetime, as, well, as, the, appearance, of, singularities, where, curvature, length, scales, become, microscopic, indicate, the, need, for, a, full, theory, of, quantum, gravity, for, an, adequate, description, of, the, interior, of, black, holes, and, of, the, very, early, universe, a, theory, is, required, in, which, gravity, and, the, associated, geometry, of, spacetime, are, described, in, the, language, of, quantum, physics, despite, major, efforts, no, complete, and, consistent, theory, of, quantum, gravity, is, currently, known, even, though, a, number, of, promising, candidates, exist, attempts, to, generalize, ordinary, quantum, field, theories, used, in, elementary, particle, physics, to, describe, fundamental, interactions, so, as, to, include, gravity, have, led, to, serious, problems, some, have, argued, that, at, low, energies, this, approach, proves, successful, in, that, it, results, in, an, acceptable, effective, quantum, field, theory, of, gravity, at, very, high, energies, however, the, perturbative, results, are, badly, divergent, and, lead, to, models, devoid, of, predictive, power, perturbative, non, renormalizability, one, attempt, to, overcome, these, limitations, is, string, theory, a, quantum, theory, not, of, point, particles, but, of, minute, one, dimensional, extended, objects, the, theory, promises, to, be, a, unified, description, of, all, particles, and, interactions, including, gravity, the, price, to, pay, is, unusual, features, such, as, six, extra, dimensions, of, space, in, addition, to, the, usual, three, in, what, is, called, the, second, superstring, revolution, it, was, conjectured, that, both, string, theory, and, a, unification, of, general, relativity, and, supersymmetry, known, as, supergravity, form, part, of, a, hypothesized, eleven, dimensional, model, known, as, m, theory, which, would, constitute, a, uniquely, defined, and, consistent, theory, of, quantum, gravity, another, approach, starts, with, the, canonical, quantization, procedures, of, quantum, theory, using, the, initial, value, formulation, of, general, relativity, cf, evolution, equations, above, the, result, is, the, wheeler, dewitt, equation, an, analogue, of, the, schr, dinger, equation, which, regrettably, turns, out, to, be, ill, defined, without, a, proper, ultraviolet, lattice, cutoff, however, with, the, introduction, of, what, are, now, known, as, ashtekar, variables, this, leads, to, a, promising, model, known, as, loop, quantum, gravity, space, is, represented, by, a, web, like, structure, called, a, spin, network, evolving, over, time, in, discrete, steps, depending, on, which, features, of, general, relativity, and, quantum, theory, are, accepted, unchanged, and, on, what, level, changes, are, introduced, there, are, numerous, other, attempts, to, arrive, at, a, viable, theory, of, quantum, gravity, some, examples, being, the, lattice, theory, of, gravity, based, on, the, feynman, path, integral, approach, and, regge, calculus, dynamical, triangulations, causal, sets, twistor, models, or, the, path, integral, based, models, of, quantum, cosmology, all, candidate, theories, still, have, major, formal, and, conceptual, problems, to, overcome, they, also, face, the, common, problem, that, as, yet, there, is, no, way, to, put, quantum, gravity, predictions, to, experimental, tests, and, thus, to, decide, between, the, candidates, where, their, predictions, vary, although, there, is, hope, for, this, to, change, as, future, data, from, cosmological, observations, and, particle, physics, experiments, becomes, available, general, relativity, has, emerged, as, a, highly, successful, model, of, gravitation, and, cosmology, which, has, so, far, passed, many, unambiguous, observational, and, experimental, tests, however, there, are, strong, indications, that, the, theory, is, incomplete, the, problem, of, quantum, gravity, and, the, question, of, the, reality, of, spacetime, singularities, remain, open, observational, data, that, is, taken, as, evidence, for, dark, energy, and, dark, matter, could, indicate, the, need, for, new, physics, even, taken, as, is, general, relativity, is, rich, with, possibilities, for, further, exploration, mathematical, relativists, seek, to, understand, the, nature, of, singularities, and, the, fundamental, properties, of, einstein, s, equations, while, numerical, relativists, run, increasingly, powerful, computer, simulations, such, as, those, describing, merging, black, holes, in, february, 2016, it, was, announced, that, the, existence, of, gravitational, waves, was, directly, detected, by, the, advanced, ligo, team, on, 14, september, 2015, a, century, after, its, introduction, general, relativity, remains, a, highly, active, area, of, research
