a, quantum, mechanical, system, or, particle, that, is, bound, that, is, confined, spatially, can, only, take, on, certain, discrete, values, of, energy, called, energy, levels, this, contrasts, with, classical, particles, which, can, have, any, amount, of, energy, the, term, is, commonly, used, for, the, energy, levels, of, the, electrons, in, atoms, ions, or, molecules, which, are, bound, by, the, electric, field, of, the, nucleus, but, can, also, refer, to, energy, levels, of, nuclei, or, vibrational, or, rotational, energy, levels, in, molecules, the, energy, spectrum, of, a, system, with, such, discrete, energy, levels, is, said, to, be, quantized, in, chemistry, and, atomic, physics, an, electron, shell, or, principal, energy, level, may, be, thought, of, as, the, orbit, of, one, or, more, electrons, around, an, atom, s, nucleus, the, closest, shell, to, the, nucleus, is, called, the, 1, shell, also, called, k, shell, followed, by, the, 2, shell, or, l, shell, then, the, 3, shell, or, m, shell, and, so, on, farther, and, farther, from, the, nucleus, the, shells, correspond, with, the, principal, quantum, numbers, n, 1, 2, 3, 4, or, are, labeled, alphabetically, with, letters, used, in, the, x, ray, notation, k, l, m, n, each, shell, can, contain, only, a, fixed, number, of, electrons, the, first, shell, can, hold, up, to, two, electrons, the, second, shell, can, hold, up, to, eight, 2, 6, electrons, the, third, shell, can, hold, up, to, 18, 2, 6, 10, and, so, on, the, general, formula, is, that, the, n, th, shell, can, in, principle, hold, up, to, 2, n, 2, electrons, since, electrons, are, electrically, attracted, to, the, nucleus, an, atom, s, electrons, will, generally, occupy, outer, shells, only, if, the, more, inner, shells, have, already, been, completely, filled, by, other, electrons, however, this, is, not, a, strict, requirement, atoms, may, have, two, or, even, three, incomplete, outer, shells, see, madelung, rule, for, more, details, for, an, explanation, of, why, electrons, exist, in, these, shells, see, electron, configuration, if, the, potential, energy, is, set, to, zero, at, infinite, distance, from, the, atomic, nucleus, or, molecule, the, usual, convention, then, bound, electron, states, have, negative, potential, energy, if, an, atom, ion, or, molecule, is, at, the, lowest, possible, energy, level, it, and, its, electrons, are, said, to, be, in, the, ground, state, if, it, is, at, a, higher, energy, level, it, is, said, to, be, excited, or, any, electrons, that, have, higher, energy, than, the, ground, state, are, excited, an, energy, level, is, regarded, as, degenerate, if, there, is, more, than, one, measurable, quantum, mechanical, state, associated, with, it, quantized, energy, levels, result, from, the, wave, behavior, of, particles, which, gives, a, relationship, between, a, particle, s, energy, and, its, wavelength, for, a, confined, particle, such, as, an, electron, in, an, atom, the, wave, functions, that, have, well, defined, energies, have, the, form, of, a, standing, wave, states, having, well, defined, energies, are, called, stationary, states, because, they, are, the, states, that, do, not, change, in, time, informally, these, states, correspond, to, a, whole, number, of, wavelengths, of, the, wavefunction, along, a, closed, path, a, path, that, ends, where, it, started, such, as, a, circular, orbit, around, an, atom, where, the, number, of, wavelengths, gives, the, type, of, atomic, orbital, 0, for, s, orbitals, 1, for, p, orbitals, and, so, on, elementary, examples, that, show, mathematically, how, energy, levels, come, about, are, the, particle, in, a, box, and, the, quantum, harmonic, oscillator, any, superposition, linear, combination, of, energy, states, is, also, a, quantum, state, but, such, states, change, with, time, and, do, not, have, well, defined, energies, a, measurement, of, the, energy, results, in, the, collapse, of, the, wavefunction, which, results, in, a, new, state, that, consists, of, just, a, single, energy, state, measurement, of, the, possible, energy, levels, of, an, object, is, called, spectroscopy, the, first, evidence, of, quantization, in, atoms, was, the, observation, of, spectral, lines, in, light, from, the, sun, in, the, early, 1800s, by, joseph, von, fraunhofer, and, william, hyde, wollaston, the, notion, of, energy, levels, was, proposed, in, 1913, by, danish, physicist, niels, bohr, in, the, bohr, theory, of, the, atom, the, modern, quantum, mechanical, theory, giving, an, explanation, of, these, energy, levels, in, terms, of, the, schr, dinger, equation, was, advanced, by, erwin, schr, dinger, and, werner, heisenberg, in, 1926, in, the, formulas, for, energy, of, electrons, at, various, levels, given, below, in, an, atom, the, zero, point, for, energy, is, set, when, the, electron, in, question, has, completely, left, the, atom, i, e, when, the, electron, s, principal, quantum, number, n, when, the, electron, is, bound, to, the, atom, in, any, closer, value, of, n, the, electron, s, energy, is, lower, and, is, considered, negative, assume, there, is, one, electron, in, a, given, atomic, orbital, in, a, hydrogen, like, atom, ion, the, energy, of, its, state, is, mainly, determined, by, the, electrostatic, interaction, of, the, negative, electron, with, the, positive, nucleus, the, energy, levels, of, an, electron, around, a, nucleus, are, given, by, typically, between, 1, ev, and, 10, 3, ev, where, r, is, the, rydberg, constant, z, is, the, atomic, number, n, is, the, principal, quantum, number, h, is, the, planck, constant, and, c, is, the, speed, of, light, for, hydrogen, like, atoms, ions, only, the, rydberg, levels, depend, only, on, the, principal, quantum, number, n, this, equation, is, obtained, from, combining, the, rydberg, formula, for, any, hydrogen, like, element, shown, below, with, e, h, hc, assuming, that, the, principal, quantum, number, n, above, n, 1, in, the, rydberg, formula, and, n, 2, principal, quantum, number, of, the, energy, level, the, electron, descends, from, when, emitting, a, photon, the, rydberg, formula, was, derived, from, empirical, spectroscopic, emission, data, an, equivalent, formula, can, be, derived, quantum, mechanically, from, the, time, independent, schr, dinger, equation, with, a, kinetic, energy, hamiltonian, operator, using, a, wave, function, as, an, eigenfunction, to, obtain, the, energy, levels, as, eigenvalues, but, the, rydberg, constant, would, be, replaced, by, other, fundamental, physics, constants, if, there, is, more, than, one, electron, around, the, atom, electron, electron, interactions, raise, the, energy, level, these, interactions, are, often, neglected, if, the, spatial, overlap, of, the, electron, wavefunctions, is, low, for, multi, electron, atoms, interactions, between, electrons, cause, the, preceding, equation, to, be, no, longer, accurate, as, stated, simply, with, z, as, the, atomic, number, a, simple, though, not, complete, way, to, understand, this, is, as, a, shielding, effect, where, the, outer, electrons, see, an, effective, nucleus, of, reduced, charge, since, the, inner, electrons, are, bound, tightly, to, the, nucleus, and, partially, cancel, its, charge, this, leads, to, an, approximate, correction, where, z, is, substituted, with, an, effective, nuclear, charge, symbolized, as, z, eff, that, depends, strongly, on, the, principal, quantum, number, e, n, h, c, r, z, e, f, f, 2, n, 2, displaystyle, e, n, ell, hcr, infty, frac, z, rm, eff, 2, n, 2, in, such, cases, the, orbital, types, determined, by, the, azimuthal, quantum, number, as, well, as, their, levels, within, the, molecule, affect, z, eff, and, therefore, also, affect, the, various, atomic, electron, energy, levels, the, aufbau, principle, of, filling, an, atom, with, electrons, for, an, electron, configuration, takes, these, differing, energy, levels, into, account, for, filling, an, atom, with, electrons, in, the, ground, state, the, lowest, energy, levels, are, filled, first, and, consistent, with, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, the, aufbau, principle, and, hund, s, rule, fine, structure, arises, from, relativistic, kinetic, energy, corrections, spin, orbit, coupling, an, electrodynamic, interaction, between, the, electron, s, spin, and, motion, and, the, nucleus, s, electric, field, and, the, darwin, term, contact, term, interaction, of, s, shell, electrons, inside, the, nucleus, these, affect, the, levels, by, a, typical, order, of, magnitude, of, 10, 3, ev, this, even, finer, structure, is, due, to, electron, nucleus, spin, spin, interaction, resulting, in, a, typical, change, in, the, energy, levels, by, a, typical, order, of, magnitude, of, 10, 4, ev, there, is, an, interaction, energy, associated, with, the, magnetic, dipole, moment, l, arising, from, the, electronic, orbital, angular, momentum, l, given, by, with, additionally, taking, into, account, the, magnetic, momentum, arising, from, the, electron, spin, due, to, relativistic, effects, dirac, equation, there, is, a, magnetic, momentum, s, arising, from, the, electron, spin, with, g, s, the, electron, spin, g, factor, about, 2, resulting, in, a, total, magnetic, moment, the, interaction, energy, therefore, becomes, chemical, bonds, between, atoms, in, a, molecule, form, because, they, make, the, situation, more, stable, for, the, involved, atoms, which, generally, means, the, sum, energy, level, for, the, involved, atoms, in, the, molecule, is, lower, than, if, the, atoms, were, not, so, bonded, as, separate, atoms, approach, each, other, to, covalently, bond, their, orbitals, affect, each, other, s, energy, levels, to, form, bonding, and, antibonding, molecular, orbitals, the, energy, level, of, the, bonding, orbitals, is, lower, and, the, energy, level, of, the, antibonding, orbitals, is, higher, for, the, bond, in, the, molecule, to, be, stable, the, covalent, bonding, electrons, occupy, the, lower, energy, bonding, orbital, which, may, be, signified, by, such, symbols, as, or, depending, on, the, situation, corresponding, anti, bonding, orbitals, can, be, signified, by, adding, an, asterisk, to, get, or, orbitals, a, non, bonding, orbital, in, a, molecule, is, an, orbital, with, electrons, in, outer, shells, which, do, not, participate, in, bonding, and, its, energy, level, is, the, same, as, that, of, the, constituent, atom, such, orbitals, can, be, designated, as, n, orbitals, the, electrons, in, an, n, orbital, are, typically, lone, pairs, in, polyatomic, molecules, different, vibrational, and, rotational, energy, levels, are, also, involved, roughly, speaking, a, molecular, energy, state, i, e, an, eigenstate, of, the, molecular, hamiltonian, is, the, sum, of, the, electronic, vibrational, rotational, nuclear, and, translational, components, such, that, e, e, electronic, e, vibrational, e, rotational, e, nuclear, e, translational, displaystyle, e, e, text, electronic, e, text, vibrational, e, text, rotational, e, text, nuclear, e, text, translational, where, e, electronic, is, an, eigenvalue, of, the, electronic, molecular, hamiltonian, the, value, of, the, potential, energy, surface, at, the, equilibrium, geometry, of, the, molecule, the, molecular, energy, levels, are, labelled, by, the, molecular, term, symbols, the, specific, energies, of, these, components, vary, with, the, specific, energy, state, and, the, substance, there, are, various, types, of, energy, level, diagrams, for, bonds, between, atoms, in, a, molecule, electrons, in, atoms, and, molecules, can, change, make, transitions, in, energy, levels, by, emitting, or, absorbing, a, photon, of, electromagnetic, radiation, whose, energy, must, be, exactly, equal, to, the, energy, difference, between, the, two, levels, electrons, can, also, be, completely, removed, from, a, chemical, species, such, as, an, atom, molecule, or, ion, complete, removal, of, an, electron, from, an, atom, can, be, a, form, of, ionization, which, is, effectively, moving, the, electron, out, to, an, orbital, with, an, infinite, principal, quantum, number, in, effect, so, far, away, so, as, to, have, practically, no, more, effect, on, the, remaining, atom, ion, for, various, types, of, atoms, there, are, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc, ionization, energies, for, removing, the, 1st, then, the, 2nd, then, the, 3rd, etc, of, the, highest, energy, electrons, respectively, from, the, atom, originally, in, the, ground, state, energy, in, corresponding, opposite, quantities, can, also, be, released, sometimes, in, the, form, of, photon, energy, when, electrons, are, added, to, positively, charged, ions, or, sometimes, atoms, molecules, can, also, undergo, transitions, in, their, vibrational, or, rotational, energy, levels, energy, level, transitions, can, also, be, nonradiative, meaning, emission, or, absorption, of, a, photon, is, not, involved, if, an, atom, ion, or, molecule, is, at, the, lowest, possible, energy, level, it, and, its, electrons, are, said, to, be, in, the, ground, state, if, it, is, at, a, higher, energy, level, it, is, said, to, be, excited, or, any, electrons, that, have, higher, energy, than, the, ground, state, are, excited, such, a, species, can, be, excited, to, a, higher, energy, level, by, absorbing, a, photon, whose, energy, is, equal, to, the, energy, difference, between, the, levels, conversely, an, excited, species, can, go, to, a, lower, energy, level, by, spontaneously, emitting, a, photon, equal, to, the, energy, difference, a, photon, s, energy, is, equal, to, the, planck, constant, h, times, its, frequency, f, and, thus, is, proportional, to, its, frequency, or, inversely, to, its, wavelength, since, c, the, speed, of, light, equals, to, f, correspondingly, many, kinds, of, spectroscopy, are, based, on, detecting, the, frequency, or, wavelength, of, the, emitted, or, absorbed, photons, to, provide, information, on, the, material, analyzed, including, information, on, the, energy, levels, and, electronic, structure, of, materials, obtained, by, analyzing, the, spectrum, an, asterisk, is, commonly, used, to, designate, an, excited, state, an, electron, transition, in, a, molecule, s, bond, from, a, ground, state, to, an, excited, state, may, have, a, designation, such, as, or, n, meaning, excitation, of, an, electron, from, a, bonding, to, a, antibonding, orbital, from, a, bonding, to, a, antibonding, orbital, or, from, an, n, non, bonding, to, a, antibonding, orbital, reverse, electron, transitions, for, all, these, types, of, excited, molecules, are, also, possible, to, return, to, their, ground, states, which, can, be, designated, as, or, n, a, transition, in, an, energy, level, of, an, electron, in, a, molecule, may, be, combined, with, a, vibrational, transition, and, called, a, vibronic, transition, a, vibrational, and, rotational, transition, may, be, combined, by, rovibrational, coupling, in, rovibronic, coupling, electron, transitions, are, simultaneously, combined, with, both, vibrational, and, rotational, transitions, photons, involved, in, transitions, may, have, energy, of, various, ranges, in, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, such, as, x, ray, ultraviolet, visible, light, infrared, or, microwave, radiation, depending, on, the, type, of, transition, in, a, very, general, way, energy, level, differences, between, electronic, states, are, larger, differences, between, vibrational, levels, are, intermediate, and, differences, between, rotational, levels, are, smaller, although, there, can, be, overlap, translational, energy, levels, are, practically, continuous, and, can, be, calculated, as, kinetic, energy, using, classical, mechanics, higher, temperature, causes, fluid, atoms, and, molecules, to, move, faster, increasing, their, translational, energy, and, thermally, excites, molecules, to, higher, average, amplitudes, of, vibrational, and, rotational, modes, excites, the, molecules, to, higher, internal, energy, levels, this, means, that, as, temperature, rises, translational, vibrational, and, rotational, contributions, to, molecular, heat, capacity, let, molecules, absorb, heat, and, hold, more, internal, energy, conduction, of, heat, typically, occurs, as, molecules, or, atoms, collide, transferring, the, heat, between, each, other, at, even, higher, temperatures, electrons, can, be, thermally, excited, to, higher, energy, orbitals, in, atoms, or, molecules, a, subsequent, drop, of, an, electron, to, a, lower, energy, level, can, release, a, photon, causing, a, possibly, coloured, glow, an, electron, farther, from, the, nucleus, has, higher, potential, energy, than, an, electron, closer, to, the, nucleus, thus, it, becomes, less, bound, to, the, nucleus, since, its, potential, energy, is, negative, and, inversely, dependent, on, its, distance, from, the, nucleus, crystalline, solids, are, found, to, have, energy, bands, instead, of, or, in, addition, to, energy, levels, electrons, can, take, on, any, energy, within, an, unfilled, band, at, first, this, appears, to, be, an, exception, to, the, requirement, for, energy, levels, however, as, shown, in, band, theory, energy, bands, are, actually, made, up, of, many, discrete, energy, levels, which, are, too, close, together, to, resolve, within, a, band, the, number, of, levels, is, of, the, order, of, the, number, of, atoms, in, the, crystal, so, although, electrons, are, actually, restricted, to, these, energies, they, appear, to, be, able, to, take, on, a, continuum, of, values, the, important, energy, levels, in, a, crystal, are, the, top, of, the, valence, band, the, bottom, of, the, conduction, band, the, fermi, level, the, vacuum, level, and, the, energy, levels, of, any, defect, states, in, the, crystal
