https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcturus
arcturus, is, the, brightest, star, in, the, northern, constellation, of, bo, tes, with, an, apparent, visual, magnitude, of, 0, 05, it, is, the, fourth, brightest, star, in, the, night, sky, and, the, brightest, in, the, northern, celestial, hemisphere, the, name, arcturus, originated, from, ancient, greece, it, was, then, cataloged, as, bo, tis, by, johann, bayer, in, 1603, which, is, latinized, to, alpha, bo, tis, arcturus, forms, one, corner, of, the, spring, triangle, asterism, located, relatively, close, at, 36, 7, light, years, from, the, sun, arcturus, is, a, red, giant, of, spectral, type, k1, 5iii, an, aging, star, around, 7, 1, billion, years, old, that, has, used, up, its, core, hydrogen, and, evolved, off, the, main, sequence, it, is, about, the, same, mass, as, the, sun, but, has, expanded, to, 25, times, its, size, around, 35, million, kilometers, and, is, around, 170, times, as, luminous, the, traditional, name, arcturus, is, latinised, from, the, ancient, greek, arktouros, and, means, guardian, of, the, bear, ultimately, from, arktos, bear, and, ouros, watcher, guardian, the, designation, of, arcturus, as, bo, tis, latinised, to, alpha, bo, tis, was, made, by, johann, bayer, in, 1603, in, 2016, the, international, astronomical, union, organized, a, working, group, on, star, names, wgsn, to, catalog, and, standardize, proper, names, for, stars, the, wgsn, s, first, bulletin, of, july, 2016, included, a, table, of, the, first, two, batches, of, names, approved, by, the, wgsn, which, included, arcturus, for, bo, tis, with, an, apparent, visual, magnitude, of, 0, 05, arcturus, is, the, brightest, star, in, the, northern, celestial, hemisphere, and, the, fourth, brightest, star, in, the, night, sky, after, sirius, 1, 46, apparent, magnitude, canopus, 0, 72, and, centauri, combined, magnitude, of, 0, 27, however, centauri, ab, is, a, binary, star, whose, components, are, each, fainter, than, arcturus, this, makes, arcturus, the, third, brightest, individual, star, just, ahead, of, centauri, a, officially, named, rigil, kentaurus, whose, apparent, magnitude, is, 0, 01, the, french, mathematician, and, astronomer, jean, baptiste, morin, observed, arcturus, in, the, daytime, with, a, telescope, in, 1635, this, was, the, first, recorded, full, daylight, viewing, for, any, star, other, than, the, sun, and, supernovae, arcturus, has, been, seen, at, or, just, before, sunset, with, the, naked, eye, arcturus, is, visible, from, both, of, earth, s, hemispheres, as, it, is, located, 19, north, of, the, celestial, equator, the, star, culminates, at, midnight, on, 27, april, and, at, 9, p, m, on, june, 10, being, visible, during, the, late, northern, spring, or, the, southern, autumn, from, the, northern, hemisphere, an, easy, way, to, find, arcturus, is, to, follow, the, arc, of, the, handle, of, the, big, dipper, or, plough, in, the, uk, by, continuing, in, this, path, one, can, find, spica, arc, to, arcturus, then, spike, or, speed, on, to, spica, together, with, the, bright, stars, spica, and, regulus, or, denebola, depending, on, the, source, arcturus, is, part, of, the, spring, triangle, asterism, with, cor, caroli, these, four, stars, form, the, great, diamond, asterism, ptolemy, described, arcturus, as, subrufa, slightly, red, it, has, a, b, v, color, index, of, 1, 23, roughly, midway, between, pollux, b, v, 1, 00, and, aldebaran, b, v, 1, 54, bo, tis, or, muphrid, is, only, 3, 3, light, years, distant, from, arcturus, and, would, have, a, visual, magnitude, 2, 5, about, as, bright, as, jupiter, at, its, brightest, from, earth, whereas, an, observer, on, the, former, system, would, find, arcturus, with, a, magnitude, 5, 0, slightly, brighter, than, venus, as, seen, from, earth, but, with, an, orangish, color, based, upon, an, annual, parallax, shift, of, 88, 83, milliarcseconds, as, measured, by, the, hipparcos, satellite, arcturus, is, 36, 7, light, years, 11, 26, parsecs, from, the, sun, the, parallax, margin, of, error, is, 0, 54, milliarcseconds, translating, to, a, distance, margin, of, error, of, 0, 23, light, years, 0, 069, parsecs, because, of, its, proximity, arcturus, has, a, high, proper, motion, two, arcseconds, a, year, greater, than, any, first, magnitude, star, other, than, centauri, arcturus, is, moving, rapidly, 122, km, s, or, 270, 000, mph, relative, to, the, sun, and, is, now, almost, at, its, closest, point, to, the, sun, closest, approach, will, happen, in, about, 4, 000, years, when, the, star, will, be, a, few, hundredths, of, a, light, year, closer, to, earth, than, it, is, today, in, antiquity, arcturus, was, closer, to, the, centre, of, the, constellation, arcturus, is, thought, to, be, an, old, disk, star, and, appears, to, be, moving, with, a, group, of, 52, other, such, stars, known, as, the, arcturus, stream, with, an, absolute, magnitude, of, 0, 30, arcturus, is, together, with, vega, and, sirius, one, of, the, most, luminous, stars, in, the, sun, s, neighborhood, it, is, about, 110, times, brighter, than, the, sun, in, visible, light, wavelengths, but, this, underestimates, its, strength, as, much, of, the, light, it, gives, off, is, in, the, infrared, total, bolometric, power, output, is, about, 180, times, that, of, the, sun, with, a, near, infrared, j, band, magnitude, of, 2, 2, only, betelgeuse, 2, 9, and, r, doradus, 2, 6, are, brighter, the, lower, output, in, visible, light, is, due, to, a, lower, efficacy, as, the, star, has, a, lower, surface, temperature, than, the, sun, there, have, been, suggestions, that, arcturus, might, be, a, member, of, a, binary, system, with, a, faint, cool, companion, but, no, companion, has, been, directly, detected, in, the, absence, of, a, binary, companion, the, mass, of, arcturus, cannot, be, measured, directly, but, models, suggest, it, is, slightly, greater, than, that, of, the, sun, evolutionary, matching, to, the, observed, physical, parameters, gives, a, mass, of, 1, 08, 0, 06, m, while, the, oxygen, isotope, ratio, for, a, first, dredge, up, star, gives, a, mass, of, 1, 2, m, the, star, given, its, evolutionary, state, is, expected, to, have, undergone, significant, mass, loss, in, the, past, the, star, displays, magnetic, activity, that, is, heating, the, coronal, structures, and, it, undergoes, a, solar, type, magnetic, cycle, with, a, duration, that, is, probably, less, than, 14, years, a, weak, magnetic, field, has, been, detected, in, the, photosphere, with, a, strength, of, around, half, a, gauss, the, magnetic, activity, appears, to, lie, along, four, latitudes, and, is, rotationally, modulated, arcturus, is, estimated, to, be, around, 6, to, 8, 5, billion, years, old, but, there, is, some, uncertainty, about, its, evolutionary, status, based, upon, the, color, characteristics, of, arcturus, it, is, currently, ascending, the, red, giant, branch, and, will, continue, to, do, so, until, it, accumulates, a, large, enough, degenerate, helium, core, to, ignite, the, helium, flash, it, has, likely, exhausted, the, hydrogen, from, its, core, and, is, now, in, its, active, hydrogen, shell, burning, phase, however, charbonnel, et, al, 1998, placed, it, slightly, above, the, horizontal, branch, and, suggested, it, has, already, completed, the, helium, flash, stage, arcturus, has, evolved, off, the, main, sequence, to, the, red, giant, branch, reaching, an, early, k, type, stellar, classification, it, is, frequently, assigned, the, spectral, type, of, k0iii, but, in, 1989, was, used, as, the, spectral, standard, for, type, k1, 5iii, fe, 0, 5, with, the, suffix, notation, indicating, a, mild, underabundance, of, iron, compared, to, typical, stars, of, its, type, as, the, brightest, k, type, giant, in, the, sky, it, has, been, the, subject, of, multiple, atlases, with, coverage, from, the, ultraviolet, to, infrared, the, spectrum, shows, a, dramatic, transition, from, emission, lines, in, the, ultraviolet, to, atomic, absorption, lines, in, the, visible, range, and, molecular, absorption, lines, in, the, infrared, this, is, due, to, the, optical, depth, of, the, atmosphere, varying, with, wavelength, the, spectrum, shows, very, strong, absorption, in, some, molecular, lines, that, are, not, produced, in, the, photosphere, but, in, a, surrounding, shell, examination, of, carbon, monoxide, lines, show, the, molecular, component, of, the, atmosphere, extending, outward, to, 2, 3, times, the, radius, of, the, star, with, the, chromospheric, wind, steeply, accelerating, to, 35, 40, km, s, in, this, region, astronomers, term, metals, those, elements, with, higher, atomic, numbers, than, helium, the, atmosphere, of, arcturus, has, an, enrichment, of, alpha, elements, relative, to, iron, but, only, about, a, third, of, solar, metallicity, arcturus, is, possibly, a, population, ii, star, as, one, of, the, brightest, stars, in, the, sky, arcturus, has, been, the, subject, of, a, number, of, studies, in, the, emerging, field, of, asteroseismology, belmonte, and, colleagues, carried, out, a, radial, velocity, doppler, shift, of, spectral, lines, study, of, the, star, in, april, and, may, 1988, which, showed, variability, with, a, frequency, of, the, order, of, a, few, microhertz, hz, the, highest, peak, corresponding, to, 4, 3, hz, 2, 7, days, with, an, amplitude, of, 60, ms, 1, with, a, frequency, separation, of, c, 5, hz, they, suggested, that, the, most, plausible, explanation, for, the, variability, of, arcturus, is, stellar, oscillations, asteroseismological, measurements, allow, direct, calculation, of, the, mass, and, radius, giving, values, of, 0, 8, 0, 2, m, and, 27, 9, 3, 4, r, this, form, of, modelling, is, still, relatively, inaccurate, but, a, useful, check, on, other, models, hipparcos, satellite, astrometry, suggested, that, arcturus, is, a, binary, star, with, the, companion, about, twenty, times, dimmer, than, the, primary, and, orbiting, close, enough, to, be, at, the, very, limits, of, humans, current, ability, to, make, it, out, recent, results, remain, inconclusive, but, do, support, the, marginal, hipparcos, detection, of, a, binary, companion, in, 1993, radial, velocity, measurements, of, aldebaran, arcturus, and, pollux, showed, that, arcturus, exhibited, a, long, period, radial, velocity, oscillation, which, could, be, interpreted, as, a, substellar, companion, this, substellar, object, would, be, nearly, 12, times, the, mass, of, jupiter, and, be, located, roughly, at, the, same, orbital, distance, from, arcturus, as, the, earth, is, from, the, sun, at, 1, 1, astronomical, units, however, all, three, stars, surveyed, showed, similar, oscillations, yielding, similar, companion, masses, and, the, authors, concluded, that, the, variation, was, likely, to, be, intrinsic, to, the, star, rather, than, due, to, the, gravitational, effect, of, a, companion, so, far, no, substellar, companion, has, been, confirmed, one, astronomical, tradition, associates, arcturus, with, the, mythology, around, arcas, who, was, about, to, shoot, and, kill, his, own, mother, callisto, who, had, been, transformed, into, a, bear, zeus, averted, their, imminent, tragic, fate, by, transforming, the, boy, into, the, constellation, bo, tes, called, arctophylax, bear, guardian, by, the, greeks, and, his, mother, into, ursa, major, greek, arctos, the, bear, the, account, is, given, in, hyginus, s, astronomy, aratus, in, his, phaenomena, said, that, the, star, arcturus, lay, below, the, belt, of, arctophylax, and, according, to, ptolemy, in, the, almagest, it, lay, between, his, thighs, an, alternative, lore, associates, the, name, with, the, legend, around, icarius, who, gave, the, gift, of, wine, to, other, men, but, was, murdered, by, them, because, they, had, had, no, experience, with, intoxication, and, mistook, the, wine, for, poison, it, is, stated, that, icarius, became, arcturus, while, his, dog, maira, became, canicula, procyon, although, arcturus, here, may, be, used, in, the, sense, of, the, constellation, rather, than, the, star, as, one, of, the, brightest, stars, in, the, sky, arcturus, has, been, significant, to, observers, since, antiquity, in, ancient, mesopotamia, it, was, linked, to, the, god, enlil, and, also, known, as, shudun, yoke, or, shu, pa, of, unknown, derivation, in, the, three, stars, each, babylonian, star, catalogues, and, later, mul, apin, around, 1100, bc, in, ancient, greek, the, star, is, found, in, ancient, astronomical, literature, e, g, hesiod, s, work, and, days, circa, 700, bc, as, well, as, hipparchus, s, and, ptolemy, s, star, catalogs, the, folk, etymology, connecting, the, star, name, with, the, bears, greek, arktos, was, probably, invented, much, later, it, fell, out, of, use, in, favour, of, arabic, names, until, it, was, revived, in, the, renaissance, arcturus, is, also, mentioned, in, plato, s, laws, 844e, as, a, herald, for, the, season, of, vintage, specifically, figs, and, grapes, in, arabic, arcturus, is, one, of, two, stars, called, al, sim, k, the, uplifted, ones, the, other, is, spica, arcturus, is, specified, as, as, sim, k, ar, r, mi, the, uplifted, one, of, the, lancer, the, term, al, simak, al, ramih, has, appeared, in, al, achsasi, al, mouakket, catalogue, translated, into, latin, as, al, simak, lanceator, this, has, been, variously, romanized, in, the, past, leading, to, obsolete, variants, such, as, aramec, and, azimech, for, example, the, name, alramih, is, used, in, geoffrey, chaucer, s, a, treatise, on, the, astrolabe, 1391, another, arabic, name, is, haris, el, sema, from, ris, al, sam, the, keeper, of, heaven, or, ris, al, sham, l, the, keeper, of, north, in, indian, astronomy, arcturus, is, called, swati, or, svati, devanagari, transliteration, iast, sv, ti, sv, t, possibly, su, ati, great, goer, in, reference, to, its, remoteness, meaning, very, beneficent, it, has, been, referred, to, as, the, real, pearl, in, bhart, hari, s, k, vyas, in, chinese, astronomy, arcturus, is, called, da, jiao, chinese, pinyin, d, ji, o, lit, great, horn, because, it, is, the, brightest, star, in, the, chinese, constellation, called, jiao, xiu, chinese, pinyin, ji, o, xi, lit, horn, star, later, it, became, a, part, of, another, constellation, kang, xiu, chinese, pinyin, k, ng, xi, the, wotjobaluk, koori, people, of, southeastern, australia, knew, arcturus, as, marpean, kurrk, mother, of, djuit, antares, and, another, star, in, bo, tes, weet, kurrk, muphrid, its, appearance, in, the, north, signified, the, arrival, of, the, larvae, of, the, wood, ant, a, food, item, in, spring, the, beginning, of, summer, was, marked, by, the, star, s, setting, with, the, sun, in, the, west, and, the, disappearance, of, the, larvae, the, people, of, milingimbi, island, in, arnhem, land, saw, arcturus, and, muphrid, as, man, and, woman, and, took, the, appearance, of, arcturus, at, sunrise, as, a, sign, to, go, and, harvest, rakia, or, spikerush, the, weilwan, of, northern, new, south, wales, knew, arcturus, as, guembila, red, 84, prehistoric, polynesian, navigators, knew, arcturus, as, h, k, le, a, the, star, of, joy, arcturus, is, the, zenith, star, of, the, hawaiian, islands, using, h, k, le, a, and, other, stars, the, polynesians, launched, their, double, hulled, canoes, from, tahiti, and, the, marquesas, islands, traveling, east, and, north, they, eventually, crossed, the, equator, and, reached, the, latitude, at, which, arcturus, would, appear, directly, overhead, in, the, summer, night, sky, knowing, they, had, arrived, at, the, exact, latitude, of, the, island, chain, they, sailed, due, west, on, the, trade, winds, to, landfall, if, h, k, le, a, could, be, kept, directly, overhead, they, landed, on, the, southeastern, shores, of, the, big, island, of, hawaii, for, a, return, trip, to, tahiti, the, navigators, could, use, sirius, the, zenith, star, of, that, island, since, 1976, the, polynesian, voyaging, society, s, h, k, le, a, has, crossed, the, pacific, ocean, many, times, under, navigators, who, have, incorporated, this, wayfinding, technique, in, their, non, instrument, navigation, arcturus, had, several, other, names, that, described, its, significance, to, indigenous, polynesians, in, the, society, islands, arcturus, called, ana, tahua, taata, metua, te, tupu, mavae, a, pillar, to, stand, by, was, one, of, the, ten, pillars, of, the, sky, bright, stars, that, represented, the, ten, heavens, of, the, tahitian, afterlife, in, hawaii, the, pattern, of, bo, tes, was, called, hoku, iwa, meaning, stars, of, the, frigatebird, this, constellation, marked, the, path, for, hawai, iloa, on, his, return, to, hawaii, from, the, south, pacific, ocean, the, hawaiians, called, arcturus, hoku, le, a, it, was, equated, to, the, tuamotuan, constellation, te, kiva, meaning, frigatebird, which, could, either, represent, the, figure, of, bo, tes, or, just, arcturus, however, arcturus, may, instead, be, the, tuamotuan, star, called, turu, the, hawaiian, name, for, arcturus, as, a, single, star, was, likely, hoku, le, a, which, means, star, of, gladness, or, clear, star, in, the, marquesas, islands, arcturus, was, probably, called, tau, tou, and, was, the, star, that, ruled, the, month, approximating, january, the, m, ori, and, moriori, called, it, tautoru, a, variant, of, the, marquesan, name, and, a, name, shared, with, orion, s, belt, in, inuit, astronomy, arcturus, is, called, the, old, man, uttuqalualuk, in, inuit, languages, and, the, first, ones, sivulliik, in, inuit, languages, the, mi, kmaq, of, eastern, canada, saw, arcturus, as, kookoogw, ss, the, owl, early, 20th, century, armenian, scientist, nazaret, daghavarian, theorized, that, the, star, commonly, referred, to, in, armenian, folklore, as, gutani, astgh, armenian, lit, star, of, the, plow, was, in, fact, arcturus, as, the, constellation, of, bo, tes, was, called, ezogh, armenian, lit, the, person, who, is, plowing, by, armenians, in, ancient, rome, the, star, s, celestial, activity, was, supposed, to, portend, tempestuous, weather, and, a, personification, of, the, star, acts, as, narrator, of, the, prologue, to, plautus, comedy, rudens, circa, 211, bc, the, k, ra, avy, ha, s, tra,

etymologies, offered, for, the, name, arthur, assumes, that, it, is, derived, from, arcturus, and, that, the, late, 5th, to, early, 6th, century, figure, on, whom, the, myth, of, king, arthur, is, based, was, originally, named, for, the, star, in, the, middle, ages, arcturus, was, considered, a, behenian, fixed, star, and, attributed, to, the, stone, jasper, and, the, plantain, herb, cornelius, agrippa, listed, its, kabbalistic, sign, under, the, alternate, name, alchameth, arcturus, s, light, was, employed, in, the, mechanism, used, to, open, the, 1933, chicago, world, s, fair, the, star, was, chosen, as, it, was, thought, that, light, from, arcturus, had, started, its, journey, at, about, the, time, of, the, previous, chicago, world, s, fair, in, 1893, at, 36, 7, light, years, away, the, light, actually, started, in, 1896, at, the, height, of, the, american, civil, war, president, abraham, lincoln, observed, arcturus, through, a, 9, 6, inch, refractor, telescope, when, he, visited, the, naval, observatory, in, washington, dc, in, august, 1863
