in, physics, motion, is, when, an, object, changes, its, position, with, respect, to, a, reference, point, in, a, given, time, motion, is, mathematically, described, in, terms, of, displacement, distance, velocity, acceleration, speed, and, frame, of, reference, to, an, observer, measuring, the, change, in, position, of, the, body, relative, to, that, frame, with, a, change, in, time, the, branch, of, physics, describing, the, motion, of, objects, without, reference, to, their, cause, is, called, kinematics, while, the, branch, studying, forces, and, their, effect, on, motion, is, called, dynamics, if, an, object, is, not, in, motion, relative, to, a, given, frame, of, reference, it, is, said, to, be, at, rest, motionless, immobile, stationary, or, to, have, a, constant, or, time, invariant, position, with, reference, to, its, surroundings, modern, physics, holds, that, as, there, is, no, absolute, frame, of, reference, newton, s, concept, of, absolute, motion, cannot, be, determined, everything, in, the, universe, can, be, considered, to, be, in, motion, 20, 21, motion, applies, to, various, physical, systems, objects, bodies, matter, particles, matter, fields, radiation, radiation, fields, radiation, particles, curvature, and, space, time, one, can, also, speak, of, the, motion, of, images, shapes, and, boundaries, in, general, the, term, motion, signifies, a, continuous, change, in, the, position, or, configuration, of, a, physical, system, in, space, for, example, one, can, talk, about, the, motion, of, a, wave, or, the, motion, of, a, quantum, particle, where, the, configuration, consists, of, the, probabilities, of, the, wave, or, particle, occupying, specific, positions, in, physics, the, motion, of, massive, bodies, is, described, through, two, related, sets, of, laws, of, mechanics, classical, mechanics, for, super, atomic, larger, than, an, atom, objects, such, as, cars, projectiles, planets, cells, and, humans, and, quantum, mechanics, for, atomic, and, sub, atomic, objects, such, as, helium, protons, and, electrons, historically, newton, and, euler, formulated, three, laws, of, classical, mechanics, if, the, resultant, force, f, displaystyle, vec, f, acting, on, a, body, or, an, object, is, not, equal, to, zero, the, body, will, have, an, acceleration, a, displaystyle, a, that, is, in, the, same, direction, as, the, resultant, force, classical, mechanics, is, used, for, describing, the, motion, of, macroscopic, objects, moving, at, speeds, significantly, slower, than, the, speed, of, light, from, projectiles, to, parts, of, machinery, as, well, as, astronomical, objects, such, as, spacecraft, planets, stars, and, galaxies, it, produces, very, accurate, results, within, these, domains, and, is, one, of, the, oldest, and, largest, scientific, descriptions, in, science, engineering, and, technology, classical, mechanics, is, fundamentally, based, on, newton, s, laws, of, motion, these, laws, describe, the, relationship, between, the, forces, acting, on, a, body, and, the, motion, of, that, body, they, were, first, compiled, by, sir, isaac, newton, in, his, work, philosophi, naturalis, principia, mathematica, which, was, first, published, on, july, 5, 1687, newton, s, three, laws, are, newton, s, three, laws, of, motion, were, the, first, to, accurately, provide, a, mathematical, model, for, understanding, orbiting, bodies, in, outer, space, this, explanation, unified, the, motion, of, celestial, bodies, and, the, motion, of, objects, on, earth, modern, kinematics, developed, with, study, of, electromagnetism, and, refers, all, velocities, v, displaystyle, v, to, their, ratio, to, speed, of, light, c, displaystyle, c, velocity, is, then, interpreted, as, rapidity, the, hyperbolic, angle, displaystyle, varphi, for, which, the, hyperbolic, tangent, function, tanh, v, c, displaystyle, tanh, varphi, v, div, c, acceleration, the, change, of, velocity, over, time, then, changes, rapidity, according, to, lorentz, transformations, this, part, of, mechanics, is, special, relativity, efforts, to, incorporate, gravity, into, relativistic, mechanics, were, made, by, w, k, clifford, and, albert, einstein, the, development, used, differential, geometry, to, describe, a, curved, universe, with, gravity, the, study, is, called, general, relativity, quantum, mechanics, is, a, set, of, principles, describing, physical, reality, at, the, atomic, level, of, matter, molecules, and, atoms, and, the, subatomic, particles, electrons, protons, neutrons, and, even, smaller, elementary, particles, such, as, quarks, these, descriptions, include, the, simultaneous, wave, like, and, particle, like, behavior, of, both, matter, and, radiation, energy, as, described, in, the, wave, particle, duality, in, classical, mechanics, accurate, measurements, and, predictions, of, the, state, of, objects, can, be, calculated, such, as, location, and, velocity, in, quantum, mechanics, due, to, the, heisenberg, uncertainty, principle, the, complete, state, of, a, subatomic, particle, such, as, its, location, and, velocity, cannot, be, simultaneously, determined, in, addition, to, describing, the, motion, of, atomic, level, phenomena, quantum, mechanics, is, useful, in, understanding, some, large, scale, phenomena, such, as, superfluidity, superconductivity, and, biological, systems, including, the, function, of, smell, receptors, and, the, structures, of, protein, humans, like, all, known, things, in, the, universe, are, in, constant, motion, 8, 9, however, aside, from, obvious, movements, of, the, various, external, body, parts, and, locomotion, humans, are, in, motion, in, a, variety, of, ways, that, are, more, difficult, to, perceive, many, of, these, imperceptible, motions, are, only, perceivable, with, the, help, of, special, tools, and, careful, observation, the, larger, scales, of, imperceptible, motions, are, difficult, for, humans, to, perceive, for, two, reasons, newton, s, laws, of, motion, particularly, the, third, which, prevents, the, feeling, of, motion, on, a, mass, to, which, the, observer, is, connected, and, the, lack, of, an, obvious, frame, of, reference, that, would, allow, individuals, to, easily, see, that, they, are, moving, the, smaller, scales, of, these, motions, are, too, small, to, be, detected, conventionally, with, human, senses, spacetime, the, fabric, of, the, universe, is, expanding, meaning, everything, in, the, universe, is, stretching, like, a, rubber, band, this, motion, is, the, most, obscure, as, it, is, not, physical, motion, but, rather, a, change, in, the, very, nature, of, the, universe, the, primary, source, of, verification, of, this, expansion, was, provided, by, edwin, hubble, who, demonstrated, that, all, galaxies, and, distant, astronomical, objects, were, moving, away, from, earth, known, as, hubble, s, law, predicted, by, a, universal, expansion, the, milky, way, galaxy, is, moving, through, space, and, many, astronomers, believe, the, velocity, of, this, motion, to, be, approximately, 600, kilometres, per, second, 1, 340, 000, mph, relative, to, the, observed, locations, of, other, nearby, galaxies, another, reference, frame, is, provided, by, the, cosmic, microwave, background, this, frame, of, reference, indicates, that, the, milky, way, is, moving, at, around, 582, kilometres, per, second, 1, 300, 000, mph, the, milky, way, is, rotating, around, its, dense, galactic, center, thus, the, sun, is, moving, in, a, circle, within, the, galaxy, s, gravity, away, from, the, central, bulge, or, outer, rim, the, typical, stellar, velocity, is, between, 210, and, 240, kilometres, per, second, 470, 000, and, 540, 000, mph, all, planets, and, their, moons, move, with, the, sun, thus, the, solar, system, is, in, motion, the, earth, is, rotating, or, spinning, around, its, axis, this, is, evidenced, by, day, and, night, at, the, equator, the, earth, has, an, eastward, velocity, of, 0, 4651, kilometres, per, second, 1, 040, mph, the, earth, is, also, orbiting, around, the, sun, in, an, orbital, revolution, a, complete, orbit, around, the, sun, takes, one, year, or, about, 365, days, it, averages, a, speed, of, about, 30, kilometres, per, second, 67, 000, mph, the, theory, of, plate, tectonics, tells, us, that, the, continents, are, drifting, on, convection, currents, within, the, mantle, causing, them, to, move, across, the, surface, of, the, planet, at, the, slow, speed, of, approximately, 2, 54, centimetres, 1, in, per, year, however, the, velocities, of, plates, range, widely, the, fastest, moving, plates, are, the, oceanic, plates, with, the, cocos, plate, advancing, at, a, rate, of, 75, millimetres, 3, 0, in, per, year, and, the, pacific, plate, moving, 52, 69, millimetres, 2, 0, 2, 7, in, per, year, at, the, other, extreme, the, slowest, moving, plate, is, the, eurasian, plate, progressing, at, a, typical, rate, of, about, 21, millimetres, 0, 83, in, per, year, the, human, heart, is, regularly, contracting, to, move, blood, throughout, the, body, through, larger, veins, and, arteries, in, the, body, blood, has, been, found, to, travel, at, approximately, 0, 33, m, s, though, considerable, variation, exists, and, peak, flows, in, the, venae, cavae, have, been, found, between, 0, 1, and, 0, 45, metres, per, second, 0, 33, and, 1, 48, ft, s, additionally, the, smooth, muscles, of, hollow, internal, organs, are, moving, the, most, familiar, would, be, the, occurrence, of, peristalsis, which, is, where, digested, food, is, forced, throughout, the, digestive, tract, though, different, foods, travel, through, the, body, at, different, rates, an, average, speed, through, the, human, small, intestine, is, 3, 48, kilometres, per, hour, 2, 16, mph, the, human, lymphatic, system, is, also, constantly, causing, movements, of, excess, fluids, lipids, and, immune, system, related, products, around, the, body, the, lymph, fluid, has, been, found, to, move, through, a, lymph, capillary, of, the, skin, at, approximately, 0, 0000097, m, s, the, cells, of, the, human, body, have, many, structures, and, organelles, that, move, throughout, them, cytoplasmic, streaming, is, a, way, in, which, cells, move, molecular, substances, throughout, the, cytoplasm, various, motor, proteins, work, as, molecular, motors, within, a, cell, and, move, along, the, surface, of, various, cellular, substrates, such, as, microtubules, and, motor, proteins, are, typically, powered, by, the, hydrolysis, of, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, and, convert, chemical, energy, into, mechanical, work, vesicles, propelled, by, motor, proteins, have, been, found, to, have, a, velocity, of, approximately, 0, 00000152, m, s, according, to, the, laws, of, thermodynamics, all, particles, of, matter, are, in, constant, random, motion, as, long, as, the, temperature, is, above, absolute, zero, thus, the, molecules, and, atoms, that, make, up, the, human, body, are, vibrating, colliding, and, moving, this, motion, can, be, detected, as, temperature, higher, temperatures, which, represent, greater, kinetic, energy, in, the, particles, feel, warm, to, humans, who, sense, the, thermal, energy, transferring, from, the, object, being, touched, to, their, nerves, similarly, when, lower, temperature, objects, are, touched, the, senses, perceive, the, transfer, of, heat, away, from, the, body, as, a, feeling, of, cold, within, the, standard, atomic, orbital, model, electrons, exist, in, a, region, around, the, nucleus, of, each, atom, this, region, is, called, the, electron, cloud, according, to, bohr, s, model, of, the, atom, electrons, have, a, high, velocity, and, the, larger, the, nucleus, they, are, orbiting, the, faster, they, would, need, to, move, if, electrons, were, to, move, about, the, electron, cloud, in, strict, paths, the, same, way, planets, orbit, the, sun, then, electrons, would, be, required, to, do, so, at, speeds, that, would, far, exceed, the, speed, of, light, however, there, is, no, reason, that, one, must, confine, oneself, to, this, strict, conceptualization, that, electrons, move, in, paths, the, same, way, macroscopic, objects, do, rather, one, can, conceptualize, electrons, to, be, particles, that, capriciously, exist, within, the, bounds, of, the, electron, cloud, inside, the, atomic, nucleus, the, protons, and, neutrons, are, also, probably, moving, around, due, to, the, electrical, repulsion, of, the, protons, and, the, presence, of, angular, momentum, of, both, particles, light, moves, at, a, speed, of, 299, 792, 458, m, s, or, 299, 792, 458, kilometres, per, second, 186, 282, 397, mi, s, in, a, vacuum, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, or, c, displaystyle, c, is, also, the, speed, of, all, massless, particles, and, associated, fields, in, a, vacuum, and, it, is, the, upper, limit, on, the, speed, at, which, energy, matter, information, or, causation, can, travel, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, is, thus, the, upper, limit, for, speed, for, all, physical, systems, in, addition, the, speed, of, light, is, an, invariant, quantity, it, has, the, same, value, irrespective, of, the, position, or, speed, of, the, observer, this, property, makes, the, speed, of, light, c, a, natural, measurement, unit, for, speed, and, a, fundamental, constant, of, nature, in, 2019, the, speed, of, light, was, redefined, alongside, all, seven, si, base, units, using, what, it, calls, the, explicit, constant, formulation, where, each, unit, is, defined, indirectly, by, specifying, explicitly, an, exact, value, for, a, well, recognized, fundamental, constant, as, was, done, for, the, speed, of, light, a, new, but, completely, equivalent, wording, of, the, metre, s, definition, was, proposed, the, metre, symbol, m, is, the, unit, of, length, its, magnitude, is, set, by, fixing, the, numerical, value, of, the, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, to, be, equal, to, exactly, 299, 792, 458, when, it, is, expressed, in, the, si, unit, m, s, 1, this, implicit, change, to, the, speed, of, light, was, one, of, the, changes, that, was, incorporated, in, the, 2019, revision, of, the, si, also, termed, the, new, si, some, motion, appears, to, an, observer, to, exceed, the, speed, of, light, bursts, of, energy, moving, out, along, the, relativistic, jets, emitted, from, these, objects, can, have, a, proper, motion, that, appears, greater, than, the, speed, of, light, all, of, these, sources, are, thought, to, contain, a, black, hole, responsible, for, the, ejection, of, mass, at, high, velocities, light, echoes, can, also, produce, apparent, superluminal, motion, this, occurs, owing, to, how, motion, is, often, calculated, at, long, distances, oftentimes, calculations, fail, to, account, for, the, fact, that, the, speed, of, light, is, finite, when, measuring, the, movement, of, distant, objects, across, the, sky, there, is, a, large, time, delay, between, what, has, been, observed, and, what, has, occurred, due, to, the, large, distance, the, light, from, the, distant, object, has, to, travel, to, reach, us, the, error, in, the, above, naive, calculation, comes, from, the, fact, that, when, an, object, has, a, component, of, velocity, directed, towards, the, earth, as, the, object, moves, closer, to, the, earth, that, time, delay, becomes, smaller, this, means, that, the, apparent, speed, as, calculated, above, is, greater, than, the, actual, speed, correspondingly, if, the, object, is, moving, away, from, the, earth, the, above, calculation, underestimates, the, actual, speed
