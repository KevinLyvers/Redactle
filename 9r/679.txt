an, ice, age, is, a, long, period, of, reduction, in, the, temperature, of, earth, s, surface, and, atmosphere, resulting, in, the, presence, or, expansion, of, continental, and, polar, ice, sheets, and, alpine, glaciers, earth, s, climate, alternates, between, ice, ages, and, greenhouse, periods, during, which, there, are, no, glaciers, on, the, planet, earth, is, currently, in, the, ice, age, called, quaternary, glaciation, individual, pulses, of, cold, climate, within, an, ice, age, are, termed, glacial, periods, glacials, glaciations, glacial, stages, stadials, stades, or, colloquially, ice, ages, and, intermittent, warm, periods, within, an, ice, age, are, called, interglacials, or, interstadials, in, glaciology, the, term, ice, age, is, defined, by, the, presence, of, extensive, ice, sheets, in, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, by, this, definition, the, current, holocene, period, is, an, interglacial, period, of, an, ice, age, the, accumulation, of, anthropogenic, greenhouse, gases, is, projected, to, delay, the, next, glacial, period, in, 1742, pierre, martel, 1706, 1767, an, engineer, and, geographer, living, in, geneva, visited, the, valley, of, chamonix, in, the, alps, of, savoy, two, years, later, he, published, an, account, of, his, journey, he, reported, that, the, inhabitants, of, that, valley, attributed, the, dispersal, of, erratic, boulders, to, the, glaciers, saying, that, they, had, once, extended, much, farther, later, similar, explanations, were, reported, from, other, regions, of, the, alps, in, 1815, the, carpenter, and, chamois, hunter, jean, pierre, perraudin, 1767, 1858, explained, erratic, boulders, in, the, val, de, bagnes, in, the, swiss, canton, of, valais, as, being, due, to, glaciers, previously, extending, further, an, unknown, woodcutter, from, meiringen, in, the, bernese, oberland, advocated, a, similar, idea, in, a, discussion, with, the, swiss, german, geologist, jean, de, charpentier, 1786, 1855, in, 1834, comparable, explanations, are, also, known, from, the, val, de, ferret, in, the, valais, and, the, seeland, in, western, switzerland, and, in, goethe, s, scientific, work, such, explanations, could, also, be, found, in, other, parts, of, the, world, when, the, bavarian, naturalist, ernst, von, bibra, 1806, 1878, visited, the, chilean, andes, in, 1849, 1850, the, natives, attributed, fossil, moraines, to, the, former, action, of, glaciers, meanwhile, european, scholars, had, begun, to, wonder, what, had, caused, the, dispersal, of, erratic, material, from, the, middle, of, the, 18th, century, some, discussed, ice, as, a, means, of, transport, the, swedish, mining, expert, daniel, tilas, 1712, 1772, was, in, 1742, the, first, person, to, suggest, drifting, sea, ice, was, a, cause, of, the, presence, of, erratic, boulders, in, the, scandinavian, and, baltic, regions, in, 1795, the, scottish, philosopher, and, gentleman, naturalist, james, hutton, 1726, 1797, explained, erratic, boulders, in, the, alps, by, the, action, of, glaciers, two, decades, later, in, 1818, the, swedish, botanist, g, ran, wahlenberg, 1780, 1851, published, his, theory, of, a, glaciation, of, the, scandinavian, peninsula, he, regarded, glaciation, as, a, regional, phenomenon, only, a, few, years, later, the, danish, norwegian, geologist, jens, esmark, 1762, 1839, argued, for, a, sequence, of, worldwide, ice, ages, in, a, paper, published, in, 1824, esmark, proposed, changes, in, climate, as, the, cause, of, those, glaciations, he, attempted, to, show, that, they, originated, from, changes, in, earth, s, orbit, esmark, discovered, the, similarity, between, moraines, near, haukalivatnet, lake, near, sea, level, in, rogaland, and, moraines, at, branches, of, jostedalsbreen, esmark, s, discovery, were, later, attributed, to, or, appropriated, by, theodor, kjerulf, and, louis, agassiz, during, the, following, years, esmark, s, ideas, were, discussed, and, taken, over, in, parts, by, swedish, scottish, and, german, scientists, at, the, university, of, edinburgh, robert, jameson, 1774, 1854, seemed, to, be, relatively, open, to, esmark, s, ideas, as, reviewed, by, norwegian, professor, of, glaciology, bj, rn, g, andersen, 1992, jameson, s, remarks, about, ancient, glaciers, in, scotland, were, most, probably, prompted, by, esmark, in, germany, albrecht, reinhard, bernhardi, 1797, 1849, a, geologist, and, professor, of, forestry, at, an, academy, in, dreissigacker, since, incorporated, in, the, southern, thuringian, city, of, meiningen, adopted, esmark, s, theory, in, a, paper, published, in, 1832, bernhardi, speculated, about, the, polar, ice, caps, once, reaching, as, far, as, the, temperate, zones, of, the, globe, in, val, de, bagnes, a, valley, in, the, swiss, alps, there, was, a, long, held, local, belief, that, the, valley, had, once, been, covered, deep, in, ice, and, in, 1815, a, local, chamois, hunter, called, jean, pierre, perraudin, attempted, to, convert, the, geologist, jean, de, charpentier, to, the, idea, pointing, to, deep, striations, in, the, rocks, and, giant, erratic, boulders, as, evidence, charpentier, held, the, general, view, that, these, signs, were, caused, by, vast, floods, and, he, rejected, perraudin, s, theory, as, absurd, in, 1818, the, engineer, ignatz, venetz, joined, perraudin, and, charpentier, to, examine, a, proglacial, lake, above, the, valley, created, by, an, ice, dam, as, a, result, of, the, 1815, eruption, of, mount, tambora, which, threatened, to, cause, a, catastrophic, flood, when, the, dam, broke, perraudin, attempted, unsuccessfully, to, convert, his, companions, to, his, theory, but, when, the, dam, finally, broke, there, were, only, minor, erratics, and, no, striations, and, venetz, concluded, that, perraudin, was, right, and, that, only, ice, could, have, caused, such, major, results, in, 1821, he, read, a, prize, winning, paper, on, the, theory, to, the, swiss, society, but, it, was, not, published, until, charpentier, who, had, also, become, converted, published, it, with, his, own, more, widely, read, paper, in, 1834, in, the, meantime, the, german, botanist, karl, friedrich, schimper, 1803, 1867, was, studying, mosses, which, were, growing, on, erratic, boulders, in, the, alpine, upland, of, bavaria, he, began, to, wonder, where, such, masses, of, stone, had, come, from, during, the, summer, of, 1835, he, made, some, excursions, to, the, bavarian, alps, schimper, came, to, the, conclusion, that, ice, must, have, been, the, means, of, transport, for, the, boulders, in, the, alpine, upland, in, the, winter, of, 1835, 36, he, held, some, lectures, in, munich, schimper, then, assumed, that, there, must, have, been, global, times, of, obliteration, ver, dungszeiten, with, a, cold, climate, and, frozen, water, schimper, spent, the, summer, months, of, 1836, at, devens, near, bex, in, the, swiss, alps, with, his, former, university, friend, louis, agassiz, 1801, 1873, and, jean, de, charpentier, schimper, charpentier, and, possibly, venetz, convinced, agassiz, that, there, had, been, a, time, of, glaciation, during, the, winter, of, 1836, 37, agassiz, and, schimper, developed, the, theory, of, a, sequence, of, glaciations, they, mainly, drew, upon, the, preceding, works, of, venetz, charpentier, and, on, their, own, fieldwork, agassiz, appears, to, have, been, already, familiar, with, bernhardi, s, paper, at, that, time, at, the, beginning, of, 1837, schimper, coined, the, term, ice, age, eiszeit, for, the, period, of, the, glaciers, in, july, 1837, agassiz, presented, their, synthesis, before, the, annual, meeting, of, the, swiss, society, for, natural, research, at, neuch, tel, the, audience, was, very, critical, and, some, were, opposed, to, the, new, theory, because, it, contradicted, the, established, opinions, on, climatic, history, most, contemporary, scientists, thought, that, earth, had, been, gradually, cooling, down, since, its, birth, as, a, molten, globe, in, order, to, persuade, the, skeptics, agassiz, embarked, on, geological, fieldwork, he, published, his, book, study, on, glaciers, tudes, sur, les, glaciers, in, 1840, charpentier, was, put, out, by, this, as, he, had, also, been, preparing, a, book, about, the, glaciation, of, the, alps, charpentier, felt, that, agassiz, should, have, given, him, precedence, as, it, was, he, who, had, introduced, agassiz, to, in, depth, glacial, research, as, a, result, of, personal, quarrels, agassiz, had, also, omitted, any, mention, of, schimper, in, his, book, it, took, several, decades, before, the, ice, age, theory, was, fully, accepted, by, scientists, this, happened, on, an, international, scale, in, the, second, half, of, the, 1870s, following, the, work, of, james, croll, including, the, publication, of, climate, and, time, in, their, geological, relations, in, 1875, which, provided, a, credible, explanation, for, the, causes, of, ice, ages, there, are, three, main, types, of, evidence, for, ice, ages, geological, chemical, and, paleontological, geological, evidence, for, ice, ages, comes, in, various, forms, including, rock, scouring, and, scratching, glacial, moraines, drumlins, valley, cutting, and, the, deposition, of, till, or, tillites, and, glacial, erratics, successive, glaciations, tend, to, distort, and, erase, the, geological, evidence, for, earlier, glaciations, making, it, difficult, to, interpret, furthermore, this, evidence, was, difficult, to, date, exactly, early, theories, assumed, that, the, glacials, were, short, compared, to, the, long, interglacials, the, advent, of, sediment, and, ice, cores, revealed, the, true, situation, glacials, are, long, interglacials, short, it, took, some, time, for, the, current, theory, to, be, worked, out, the, chemical, evidence, mainly, consists, of, variations, in, the, ratios, of, isotopes, in, fossils, present, in, sediments, and, sedimentary, rocks, and, ocean, sediment, cores, for, the, most, recent, glacial, periods, ice, cores, provide, climate, proxies, both, from, the, ice, itself, and, from, atmospheric, samples, provided, by, included, bubbles, of, air, because, water, containing, lighter, isotopes, has, a, lower, heat, of, evaporation, its, proportion, decreases, with, warmer, conditions, this, allows, a, temperature, record, to, be, constructed, this, evidence, can, be, confounded, however, by, other, factors, recorded, by, isotope, ratios, the, paleontological, evidence, consists, of, changes, in, the, geographical, distribution, of, fossils, during, a, glacial, period, cold, adapted, organisms, spread, into, lower, latitudes, and, organisms, that, prefer, warmer, conditions, become, extinct, or, retreat, into, lower, latitudes, this, evidence, is, also, difficult, to, interpret, because, it, requires, despite, the, difficulties, analysis, of, ice, core, and, ocean, sediment, cores, has, provided, a, credible, record, of, glacials, and, interglacials, over, the, past, few, million, years, these, also, confirm, the, linkage, between, ice, ages, and, continental, crust, phenomena, such, as, glacial, moraines, drumlins, and, glacial, erratics, hence, the, continental, crust, phenomena, are, accepted, as, good, evidence, of, earlier, ice, ages, when, they, are, found, in, layers, created, much, earlier, than, the, time, range, for, which, ice, cores, and, ocean, sediment, cores, are, available, there, have, been, at, least, five, major, ice, ages, in, earth, s, history, the, huronian, cryogenian, andean, saharan, late, paleozoic, and, the, latest, quaternary, ice, age, outside, these, ages, earth, was, previously, thought, to, have, been, ice, free, even, in, high, latitudes, such, periods, are, known, as, greenhouse, periods, however, other, studies, dispute, this, finding, evidence, of, occasional, glaciations, at, high, latitudes, even, during, apparent, greenhouse, periods, rocks, from, the, earliest, well, established, ice, age, called, the, huronian, have, been, dated, to, around, 2, 4, to, 2, 1, billion, years, ago, during, the, early, proterozoic, eon, several, hundreds, of, kilometers, of, the, huronian, supergroup, are, exposed, 10, to, 100, kilometers, 6, to, 62, mi, north, of, the, north, shore, of, lake, huron, extending, from, near, sault, ste, marie, to, sudbury, northeast, of, lake, huron, with, giant, layers, of, now, lithified, till, beds, dropstones, varves, outwash, and, scoured, basement, rocks, correlative, huronian, deposits, have, been, found, near, marquette, michigan, and, correlation, has, been, made, with, paleoproterozoic, glacial, deposits, from, western, australia, the, huronian, ice, age, was, caused, by, the, elimination, of, atmospheric, methane, a, greenhouse, gas, during, the, great, oxygenation, event, the, next, well, documented, ice, age, and, probably, the, most, severe, of, the, last, billion, years, occurred, from, 720, to, 630, million, years, ago, the, cryogenian, period, and, may, have, produced, a, snowball, earth, in, which, glacial, ice, sheets, reached, the, equator, possibly, being, ended, by, the, accumulation, of, greenhouse, gases, such, as, co, 2, produced, by, volcanoes, the, presence, of, ice, on, the, continents, and, pack, ice, on, the, oceans, would, inhibit, both, silicate, weathering, and, photosynthesis, which, are, the, two, major, sinks, for, co, 2, at, present, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, end, of, this, ice, age, was, responsible, for, the, subsequent, ediacaran, and, cambrian, explosion, though, this, model, is, recent, and, controversial, the, andean, saharan, occurred, from, 460, to, 420, million, years, ago, during, the, late, ordovician, and, the, silurian, period, the, evolution, of, land, plants, at, the, onset, of, the, devonian, period, caused, a, long, term, increase, in, planetary, oxygen, levels, and, reduction, of, co, 2, levels, which, resulted, in, the, late, paleozoic, icehouse, its, former, name, the, karoo, glaciation, was, named, after, the, glacial, tills, found, in, the, karoo, region, of, south, africa, there, were, extensive, polar, ice, caps, at, intervals, from, 360, to, 260, million, years, ago, in, south, africa, during, the, carboniferous, and, early, permian, periods, correlatives, are, known, from, argentina, also, in, the, center, of, the, ancient, supercontinent, gondwanaland, although, the, mesozoic, era, retained, a, greenhouse, climate, over, its, timespan, and, was, previously, assumed, to, have, been, entirely, glaciation, free, more, recent, studies, suggest, that, brief, periods, of, glaciation, occurred, in, both, hemispheres, during, the, early, cretaceous, geologic, and, palaeoclimatological, records, suggest, the, existence, of, glacial, periods, during, the, valanginian, hauterivian, and, aptian, stages, of, the, early, cretaceous, ice, rafted, glacial, dropstones, indicate, that, in, the, northern, hemisphere, ice, sheets, may, have, extended, as, far, south, as, the, iberian, peninsula, during, the, hauterivian, and, aptian, although, ice, sheets, largely, disappeared, from, earth, for, the, rest, of, the, period, potential, reports, from, the, turonian, otherwise, the, warmest, period, of, the, phanerozoic, are, disputed, ice, sheets, and, associated, sea, ice, appear, to, have, briefly, returned, to, antarctica, near, the, very, end, of, the, maastrichtian, just, prior, to, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, the, quaternary, glaciation, quaternary, ice, age, started, about, 2, 58, million, years, ago, at, the, beginning, of, the, quaternary, period, when, the, spread, of, ice, sheets, in, the, northern, hemisphere, began, since, then, the, world, has, seen, cycles, of, glaciation, with, ice, sheets, advancing, and, retreating, on, 40, 000, and, 100, 000, year, time, scales, called, glacial, periods, glacials, or, glacial, advances, and, interglacial, periods, interglacials, or, glacial, retreats, earth, is, currently, in, an, interglacial, and, the, last, glacial, period, ended, about, 11, 700, years, ago, all, that, remains, of, the, continental, ice, sheets, are, the, greenland, and, antarctic, ice, sheets, and, smaller, glaciers, such, as, on, baffin, island, the, definition, of, the, quaternary, as, beginning, 2, 58, ma, is, based, on, the, formation, of, the, arctic, ice, cap, the, antarctic, ice, sheet, began, to, form, earlier, at, about, 34, ma, in, the, mid, cenozoic, eocene, oligocene, boundary, the, term, late, cenozoic, ice, age, is, used, to, include, this, early, phase, ice, ages, can, be, further, divided, by, location, and, time, for, example, the, names, riss, 180, 000, 130, 000, years, bp, and, w, rm, 70, 000, 10, 000, years, bp, refer, specifically, to, glaciation, in, the, alpine, region, the, maximum, extent, of, the, ice, is, not, maintained, for, the, full, interval, the, scouring, action, of, each, glaciation, tends, to, remove, most, of, the, evidence, of, prior, ice, sheets, almost, completely, except, in, regions, where, the, later, sheet, does, not, achieve, full, coverage, within, the, current, glaciation, more, temperate, and, more, severe, periods, have, occurred, the, colder, periods, are, called, glacial, periods, the, warmer, periods, interglacials, such, as, the, eemian, stage, there, is, evidence, that, similar, glacial, cycles, occurred, in, previous, glaciations, including, the, andean, saharan, and, the, late, paleozoic, ice, house, the, glacial, cycles, of, the, late, paleozoic, ice, house, are, likely, responsible, for, the, deposition, of, cyclothems, glacials, are, characterized, by, cooler, and, drier, climates, over, most, of, earth, and, large, land, and, sea, ice, masses, extending, outward, from, the, poles, mountain, glaciers, in, otherwise, unglaciated, areas, extend, to, lower, elevations, due, to, a, lower, snow, line, sea, levels, drop, due, to, the, removal, of, large, volumes, of, water, above, sea, level, in, the, icecaps, there, is, evidence, that, ocean, circulation, patterns, are, disrupted, by, glaciations, the, glacials, and, interglacials, coincide, with, changes, in, orbital, forcing, of, climate, due, to, milankovitch, cycles, which, are, periodic, changes, in, earth, s, orbit, and, the, tilt, of, earth, s, rotational, axis, earth, has, been, in, an, interglacial, period, known, as, the, holocene, for, around, 11, 700, years, and, an, article, in, nature, in, 2004, argues, that, it, might, be, most, analogous, to, a, previous, interglacial, that, lasted, 28, 000, years, predicted, changes, in, orbital, forcing, suggest, that, the, next, glacial, period, would, begin, at, least, 50, 000, years, from, now, moreover, anthropogenic, forcing, from, increased, greenhouse, gases, is, estimated, to, potentially, outweigh, the, orbital, forcing, of, the, milankovitch, cycles, for, hundreds, of, thousands, of, years, each, glacial, period, is, subject, to, positive, feedback, which, makes, it, more, severe, and, negative, feedback, which, mitigates, and, in, all, cases, so, far, eventually, ends, it, an, important, form, of, feedback, is, provided, by, earth, s, albedo, which, is, how, much, of, the, sun, s, energy, is, reflected, rather, than, absorbed, by, earth, ice, and, snow, increase, earth, s, albedo, while, forests, reduce, its, albedo, when, the, air, temperature, decreases, ice, and, snow, fields, grow, and, they, reduce, forest, cover, this, continues, until, competition, with, a, negative, feedback, mechanism, forces, the, system, to, an, equilibrium, one, theory, is, that, when, glaciers, form, two, things, happen, the, ice, grinds, rocks, into, dust, and, the, land, becomes, dry, and, arid, this, allows, winds, to, transport, iron, rich, dust, into, the, open, ocean, where, it, acts, as, a, fertilizer, that, causes, massive, algal, blooms, that, pulls, large, amounts, of, co, 2, out, of, the, atmosphere, this, in, turn, makes, it, even, colder, and, causes, the, glaciers, to, grow, more, in, 1956, ewing, and, donn, hypothesized, that, an, ice, free, arctic, ocean, leads, to, increased, snowfall, at, high, latitudes, when, low, temperature, ice, covers, the, arctic, ocean, there, is, little, evaporation, or, sublimation, and, the, polar, regions, are, quite, dry, in, terms, of, precipitation, comparable, to, the, amount, found, in, mid, latitude, deserts, this, low, precipitation, allows, high, latitude, snowfalls, to, melt, during, the, summer, an, ice, free, arctic, ocean, absorbs, solar, radiation, during, the, long, summer, days, and, evaporates, more, water, into, the, arctic, atmosphere, with, higher, precipitation, portions, of, this, snow, may, not, melt, during, the, summer, and, so, glacial, ice, can, form, at, lower, altitudes, and, more, southerly, latitudes, reducing, the, temperatures, over, land, by, increased, albedo, as, noted, above, furthermore, under, this, hypothesis, the, lack, of, oceanic, pack, ice, allows, increased, exchange, of, waters, between, the, arctic, and, the, north, atlantic, oceans, warming, the, arctic, and, cooling, the, north, atlantic, current, projected, consequences, of, global, warming, include, a, brief, ice, free, arctic, ocean, period, by, 2050, additional, fresh, water, flowing, into, the, north, atlantic, during, a, warming, cycle, may, also, reduce, the, global, ocean, water, circulation, such, a, reduction, by, reducing, the, effects, of, the, gulf, stream, would, have, a, cooling, effect, on, northern, europe, which, in, turn, would, lead, to, increased, low, latitude, snow, retention, during, the, summer, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, during, an, extensive, glacial, glaciers, may, move, through, the, gulf, of, saint, lawrence, extending, into, the, north, atlantic, ocean, far, enough, to, block, the, gulf, stream, ice, sheets, that, form, during, glaciations, erode, the, land, beneath, them, this, can, reduce, the, land, area, above, sea, level, and, thus, diminish, the, amount, of, space, on, which, ice, sheets, can, form, this, mitigates, the, albedo, feedback, as, does, the, rise, in, sea, level, that, accompanies, the, reduced, area, of, ice, sheets, since, open, ocean, has, a, lower, albedo, than, land, another, negative, feedback, mechanism, is, the, increased, aridity, occurring, with, glacial, maxima, which, reduces, the, precipitation, available, to, maintain, glaciation, the, glacial, retreat, induced, by, this, or, any, other, process, can, be, amplified, by, similar, inverse, positive, feedbacks, as, for, glacial, advances, according, to, research, published, in, nature, geoscience, human, emissions, of, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, will, defer, the, next, glacial, period, researchers, used, data, on, earth, s, orbit, to, find, the, historical, warm, interglacial, period, that, looks, most, like, the, current, one, and, from, this, have, predicted, that, the, next, glacial, period, would, usually, begin, within, 1, 500, years, they, go, on, to, predict, that, emissions, have, been, so, high, that, it, will, not, the, causes, of, ice, ages, are, not, fully, understood, for, either, the, large, scale, ice, age, periods, or, the, smaller, ebb, and, flow, of, glacial, interglacial, periods, within, an, ice, age, the, consensus, is, that, several, factors, are, important, atmospheric, composition, such, as, the, concentrations, of, carbon, dioxide, and, methane, the, specific, levels, of, the, previously, mentioned, gases, are, now, able, to, be, seen, with, the, new, ice, core, samples, from, the, european, project, for, ice, coring, in, antarctica, epica, dome, c, in, antarctica, over, the, past, 800, 000, years, changes, in, earth, s, orbit, around, the, sun, known, as, milankovitch, cycles, the, motion, of, tectonic, plates, resulting, in, changes, in, the, relative, location, and, amount, of, continental, and, oceanic, crust, on, earth, s, surface, which, affect, wind, and, ocean, currents, variations, in, solar, output, the, orbital, dynamics, of, the, earth, moon, system, the, impact, of, relatively, large, meteorites, and, volcanism, including, eruptions, of, supervolcanoes, some, of, these, factors, influence, each, other, for, example, changes, in, earth, s, atmospheric, composition, especially, the, concentrations, of, greenhouse, gases, may, alter, the, climate, while, climate, change, itself, can, change, the, atmospheric, composition, for, example, by, changing, the, rate, at, which, weathering, removes, co, 2, maureen, raymo, william, ruddiman, and, others, propose, that, the, tibetan, and, colorado, plateaus, are, immense, co, 2, scrubbers, with, a, capacity, to, remove, enough, co, 2, from, the, global, atmosphere, to, be, a, significant, causal, factor, of, the, 40, million, year, cenozoic, cooling, trend, they, further, claim, that, approximately, half, of, their, uplift, and, co, 2, scrubbing, capacity, occurred, in, the, past, 10, million, years, there, is, evidence, that, greenhouse, gas, levels, fell, at, the, start, of, ice, ages, and, rose, during, the, retreat, of, the, ice, sheets, but, it, is, difficult, to, establish, cause, and, effect, see, the, notes, above, on, the, role, of, weathering, greenhouse, gas, levels, may, also, have, been, affected, by, other, factors, which, have, been, proposed, as, causes, of, ice, ages, such, as, the, movement, of, continents, and, volcanism, the, snowball, earth, hypothesis, maintains, that, the, severe, freezing, in, the, late, proterozoic, was, ended, by, an, increase, in, co, 2, levels, in, the, atmosphere, mainly, from, volcanoes, and, some, supporters, of, snowball, earth, argue, that, it, was, caused, in, the, first, place, by, a, reduction, in, atmospheric, co, 2, the, hypothesis, also, warns, of, future, snowball, earths, in, 2009, further, evidence, was, provided, that, changes, in, solar, insolation, provide, the, initial, trigger, for, earth, to, warm, after, an, ice, age, with, secondary, factors, like, increases, in, greenhouse, gases, accounting, for, the, magnitude, of, the, change, the, geological, record, appears, to, show, that, ice, ages, start, when, the, continents, are, in, positions, which, block, or, reduce, the, flow, of, warm, water, from, the, equator, to, the, poles, and, thus, allow, ice, sheets, to, form, the, ice, sheets, increase, earth, s, reflectivity, and, thus, reduce, the, absorption, of, solar, radiation, with, less, radiation, absorbed, the, atmosphere, cools, the, cooling, allows, the, ice, sheets, to, grow, which, further, increases, reflectivity, in, a, positive, feedback, loop, the, ice, age, continues, until, the, reduction, in, weathering, causes, an, increase, in, the, greenhouse, effect, there, are, three, main, contributors, from, the, layout, of, the, continents, that, obstruct, the, movement, of, warm, water, to, the, poles, since, today, s, earth, has, a, continent, over, the, south, pole, and, an, almost, land, locked, ocean, over, the, north, pole, geologists, believe, that, earth, will, continue, to, experience, glacial, periods, in, the, geologically, near, future, some, scientists, believe, that, the, himalayas, are, a, major, factor, in, the, current, ice, age, because, these, mountains, have, increased, earth, s, total, rainfall, and, therefore, the, rate, at, which, carbon, dioxide, is, washed, out, of, the, atmosphere, decreasing, the, greenhouse, effect, the, himalayas, formation, started, about, 70, million, years, ago, when, the, indo, australian, plate, collided, with, the, eurasian, plate, and, the, himalayas, are, still, rising, by, about, 5, mm, per, year, because, the, indo, australian, plate, is, still, moving, at, 67, mm, year, the, history, of, the, himalayas, broadly, fits, the, long, term, decrease, in, earth, s, average, temperature, since, the, mid, eocene, 40, million, years, ago, another, important, contribution, to, ancient, climate, regimes, is, the, variation, of, ocean, currents, which, are, modified, by, continent, position, sea, levels, and, salinity, as, well, as, other, factors, they, have, the, ability, to, cool, e, g, aiding, the, creation, of, antarctic, ice, and, the, ability, to, warm, e, g, giving, the, british, isles, a, temperate, as, opposed, to, a, boreal, climate, the, closing, of, the, isthmus, of, panama, about, 3, million, years, ago, may, have, ushered, in, the, present, period, of, strong, glaciation, over, north, america, by, ending, the, exchange, of, water, between, the, tropical, atlantic, and, pacific, oceans, analyses, suggest, that, ocean, current, fluctuations, can, adequately, account, for, recent, glacial, oscillations, during, the, last, glacial, period, the, sea, level, fluctuated, 20, 30, m, as, water, was, sequestered, primarily, in, the, northern, hemisphere, ice, sheets, when, ice, collected, and, the, sea, level, dropped, sufficiently, flow, through, the, bering, strait, the, narrow, strait, between, siberia, and, alaska, is, about, 50, m, deep, today, was, reduced, resulting, in, increased, flow, from, the, north, atlantic, this, realigned, the, thermohaline, circulation, in, the, atlantic, increasing, heat, transport, into, the, arctic, which, melted, the, polar, ice, accumulation, and, reduced, other, continental, ice, sheets, the, release, of, water, raised, sea, levels, again, restoring, the, ingress, of, colder, water, from, the, pacific, with, an, accompanying, shift, to, northern, hemisphere, ice, accumulation, according, to, a, study, published, in, nature, in, 2021, all, glacial, periods, of, ice, ages, over, the, last, 1, 5, million, years, were, associated, with, northward, shifts, of, melting, antarctic, icebergs, which, changed, ocean, circulation, patterns, leading, to, more, co, 2, being, pulled, out, of, the, atmosphere, the, authors, suggest, that, this, process, may, be, disrupted, in, the, future, as, the, southern, ocean, will, become, too, warm, for, the, icebergs, to, travel, far, enough, to, trigger, these, changes, matthias, kuhle, s, geological, theory, of, ice, age, development, was, suggested, by, the, existence, of, an, ice, sheet, covering, the, tibetan, plateau, during, the, ice, ages, last, glacial, maximum, according, to, kuhle, the, plate, tectonic, uplift, of, tibet, past, the, snow, line, has, led, to, a, surface, of, c, 2, 400, 000, square, kilometres, 930, 000, sq, mi, changing, from, bare, land, to, ice, with, a, 70, greater, albedo, the, reflection, of, energy, into, space, resulted, in, a, global, cooling, triggering, the, pleistocene, ice, age, because, this, highland, is, at, a, subtropical, latitude, with, four, to, five, times, the, insolation, of, high, latitude, areas, what, would, be, earth, s, strongest, heating, surface, has, turned, into, a, cooling, surface, kuhle, explains, the, interglacial, periods, by, the, 100, 000, year, cycle, of, radiation, changes, due, to, variations, in, earth, s, orbit, this, comparatively, insignificant, warming, when, combined, with, the, lowering, of, the, nordic, inland, ice, areas, and, tibet, due, to, the, weight, of, the, superimposed, ice, load, has, led, to, the, repeated, complete, thawing, of, the, inland, ice, areas, the, milankovitch, cycles, are, a, set, of, cyclic, variations, in, characteristics, of, earth, s, orbit, around, the, sun, each, cycle, has, a, different, length, so, at, some, times, their, effects, reinforce, each, other, and, at, other, times, they, partially, cancel, each, other, there, is, strong, evidence, that, the, milankovitch, cycles, affect, the, occurrence, of, glacial, and, interglacial, periods, within, an, ice, age, the, present, ice, age, is, the, most, studied, and, best, understood, particularly, the, last, 400, 000, years, since, this, is, the, period, covered, by, ice, cores, that, record, atmospheric, composition, and, proxies, for, temperature, and, ice, volume, within, this, period, the, match, of, glacial, interglacial, frequencies, to, the, milankovi, orbital, forcing, periods, is, so, close, that, orbital, forcing, is, generally, accepted, the, combined, effects, of, the, changing, distance, to, the, sun, the, precession, of, earth, s, axis, and, the, changing, tilt, of, earth, s, axis, redistribute, the, sunlight, received, by, earth, of, particular, importance, are, changes, in, the, tilt, of, earth, s, axis, which, affect, the, intensity, of, seasons, for, example, the, amount, of, solar, influx, in, july, at, 65, degrees, north, latitude, varies, by, as, much, as, 22, from, 450, w, m, 2, to, 550, w, m, 2, it, is, widely, believed, that, ice, sheets, advance, when, summers, become, too, cool, to, melt, all, of, the, accumulated, snowfall, from, the, previous, winter, some, believe, that, the, strength, of, the, orbital, forcing, is, too, small, to, trigger, glaciations, but, feedback, mechanisms, like, co, 2, may, explain, this, mismatch, while, milankovitch, forcing, predicts, that, cyclic, changes, in, earth, s, orbital, elements, can, be, expressed, in, the, glaciation, record, additional, explanations, are, necessary, to, explain, which, cycles, are, observed, to, be, most, important, in, the, timing, of, glacial, interglacial, periods, in, particular, during, the, last, 800, 000, years, the, dominant, period, of, glacial, interglacial, oscillation, has, been, 100, 000, years, which, corresponds, to, changes, in, earth, s, orbital, eccentricity, and, orbital, inclination, yet, this, is, by, far, the, weakest, of, the, three, frequencies, predicted, by, milankovitch, during, the, period, 3, 0, 0, 8, million, years, ago, the, dominant, pattern, of, glaciation, corresponded, to, the, 41, 000, year, period, of, changes, in, earth, s, obliquity, tilt, of, the, axis, the, reasons, for, dominance, of, one, frequency, versus, another, are, poorly, understood, and, an, active, area, of, current, research, but, the, answer, probably, relates, to, some, form, of, resonance, in, earth, s, climate, system, recent, work, suggests, that, the, 100k, year, cycle, dominates, due, to, increased, southern, pole, sea, ice, increasing, total, solar, reflectivity, the, traditional, milankovitch, explanation, struggles, to, explain, the, dominance, of, the, 100, 000, year, cycle, over, the, last, 8, cycles, richard, a, muller, gordon, j, f, macdonald, and, others, have, pointed, out, that, those, calculations, are, for, a, two, dimensional, orbit, of, earth, but, the, three, dimensional, orbit, also, has, a, 100, 000, year, cycle, of, orbital, inclination, they, proposed, that, these, variations, in, orbital, inclination, lead, to, variations, in, insolation, as, earth, moves, in, and, out, of, known, dust, bands, in, the, solar, system, although, this, is, a, different, mechanism, to, the, traditional, view, the, predicted, periods, over, the, last, 400, 000, years, are, nearly, the, same, the, muller, and, macdonald, theory, in, turn, has, been, challenged, by, jose, antonio, rial, william, ruddiman, has, suggested, a, model, that, explains, the, 100, 000, year, cycle, by, the, modulating, effect, of, eccentricity, weak, 100, 000, year, cycle, on, precession, 26, 000, year, cycle, combined, with, greenhouse, gas, feedbacks, in, the, 41, 000, and, 26, 000, year, cycles, yet, another, theory, has, been, advanced, by, peter, huybers, who, argued, that, the, 41, 000, year, cycle, has, always, been, dominant, but, that, earth, has, entered, a, mode, of, climate, behavior, where, only, the, second, or, third, cycle, triggers, an, ice, age, this, would, imply, that, the, 100, 000, year, periodicity, is, really, an, illusion, created, by, averaging, together, cycles, lasting, 80, 000, and, 120, 000, years, this, theory, is, consistent, with, a, simple, empirical, multi, state, model, proposed, by, didier, paillard, paillard, suggests, that, the, late, pleistocene, glacial, cycles, can, be, seen, as, jumps, between, three, quasi, stable, climate, states, the, jumps, are, induced, by, the, orbital, forcing, while, in, the, early, pleistocene, the, 41, 000, year, glacial, cycles, resulted, from, jumps, between, only, two, climate, states, a, dynamical, model, explaining, this, behavior, was, proposed, by, peter, ditlevsen, this, is, in, support, of, the, suggestion, that, the, late, pleistocene, glacial, cycles, are, not, due, to, the, weak, 100, 000, year, eccentricity, cycle, but, a, non, linear, response, to, mainly, the, 41, 000, year, obliquity, cycle, there, are, at, least, two, types, of, variation, in, the, sun, s, energy, output, the, long, term, increase, in, the, sun, s, output, cannot, be, a, cause, of, ice, ages, volcanic, eruptions, may, have, contributed, to, the, inception, and, or, the, end, of, ice, age, periods, at, times, during, the, paleoclimate, carbon, dioxide, levels, were, two, or, three, times, greater, than, today, volcanoes, and, movements, in, continental, plates, contributed, to, high, amounts, of, co, 2, in, the, atmosphere, carbon, dioxide, from, volcanoes, probably, contributed, to, periods, with, highest, overall, temperatures, one, suggested, explanation, of, the, paleocene, eocene, thermal, maximum, is, that, undersea, volcanoes, released, methane, from, clathrates, and, thus, caused, a, large, and, rapid, increase, in, the, greenhouse, effect, there, appears, to, be, no, geological, evidence, for, such, eruptions, at, the, right, time, but, this, does, not, prove, they, did, not, happen, the, current, geological, period, the, quaternary, which, began, about, 2, 6, million, years, ago, and, extends, into, the, present, is, marked, by, warm, and, cold, episodes, cold, phases, called, glacials, quaternary, ice, age, lasting, about, 100, 000, years, and, warm, phases, called, interglacials, lasting, 10, 000, 15, 000, years, the, last, cold, episode, of, the, last, glacial, period, ended, about, 10, 000, years, ago, earth, is, currently, in, an, interglacial, period, of, the, quaternary, called, the, holocene, the, major, glacial, stages, of, the, current, ice, age, in, north, america, are, the, illinoian, eemian, and, wisconsin, glaciation, the, use, of, the, nebraskan, afton, kansan, and, yarmouthian, stages, to, subdivide, the, ice, age, in, north, america, has, been, discontinued, by, quaternary, geologists, and, geomorphologists, these, stages, have, all, been, merged, into, the, pre, illinoian, in, the, 1980s, during, the, most, recent, north, american, glaciation, during, the, latter, part, of, the, last, glacial, maximum, 26, 000, to, 13, 300, years, ago, ice, sheets, extended, to, about, 45th, parallel, north, these, sheets, were, 3, to, 4, kilometres, 1, 9, to, 2, 5, mi, thick, this, wisconsin, glaciation, left, widespread, impacts, on, the, north, american, landscape, the, great, lakes, and, the, finger, lakes, were, carved, by, ice, deepening, old, valleys, most, of, the, lakes, in, minnesota, and, wisconsin, were, gouged, out, by, glaciers, and, later, filled, with, glacial, meltwaters, the, old, teays, river, drainage, system, was, radically, altered, and, largely, reshaped, into, the, ohio, river, drainage, system, other, rivers, were, dammed, and, diverted, to, new, channels, such, as, niagara, falls, which, formed, a, dramatic, waterfall, and, gorge, when, the, waterflow, encountered, a, limestone, escarpment, another, similar, waterfall, at, the, present, clark, reservation, state, park, near, syracuse, new, york, is, now, dry, the, area, from, long, island, to, nantucket, massachusetts, was, formed, from, glacial, till, and, the, plethora, of, lakes, on, the, canadian, shield, in, northern, canada, can, be, almost, entirely, attributed, to, the, action, of, the, ice, as, the, ice, retreated, and, the, rock, dust, dried, winds, carried, the, material, hundreds, of, miles, forming, beds, of, loess, many, dozens, of, feet, thick, in, the, missouri, valley, post, glacial, rebound, continues, to, reshape, the, great, lakes, and, other, areas, formerly, under, the, weight, of, the, ice, sheets, the, driftless, area, a, portion, of, western, and, southwestern, wisconsin, along, with, parts, of, adjacent, minnesota, iowa, and, illinois, was, not, covered, by, glaciers, a, specially, interesting, climatic, change, during, glacial, times, has, taken, place, in, the, semi, arid, andes, beside, the, expected, cooling, down, in, comparison, with, the, current, climate, a, significant, precipitation, change, happened, here, so, researches, in, the, presently, semiarid, subtropic, aconcagua, massif, 6, 962, m, have, shown, an, unexpectedly, extensive, glacial, glaciation, of, the, type, ice, stream, network, the, connected, valley, glaciers, exceeding, 100, km, in, length, flowed, down, on, the, east, side, of, this, section, of, the, andes, at, 32, 34, s, and, 69, 71, w, as, far, as, a, height, of, 2, 060, m, and, on, the, western, luff, side, still, clearly, deeper, where, current, glaciers, scarcely, reach, 10, km, in, length, the, snowline, ela, runs, at, a, height, of, 4, 600, m, and, at, that, time, was, lowered, to, 3, 200, m, asl, i, e, about, 1, 400, m, from, this, follows, that, beside, of, an, annual, depression, of, temperature, about, c, 8, 4, c, here, was, an, increase, in, precipitation, accordingly, at, glacial, times, the, humid, climatic, belt, that, today, is, situated, several, latitude, degrees, further, to, the, s, was, shifted, much, further, to, the, n, although, the, last, glacial, period, ended, more, than, 8, 000, years, ago, its, effects, can, still, be, felt, today, for, example, the, moving, ice, carved, out, the, landscape, in, canada, see, canadian, arctic, archipelago, greenland, northern, eurasia, and, antarctica, the, erratic, boulders, till, drumlins, eskers, fjords, kettle, lakes, moraines, cirques, horns, etc, are, typical, features, left, behind, by, the, glaciers, the, weight, of, the, ice, sheets, was, so, great, that, they, deformed, earth, s, crust, and, mantle, after, the, ice, sheets, melted, the, ice, covered, land, rebounded, due, to, the, high, viscosity, of, earth, s, mantle, the, flow, of, mantle, rocks, which, controls, the, rebound, process, is, very, slow, at, a, rate, of, about, 1, cm, year, near, the, center, of, rebound, area, today, during, glaciation, water, was, taken, from, the, oceans, to, form, the, ice, at, high, latitudes, thus, global, sea, level, dropped, by, about, 110, meters, exposing, the, continental, shelves, and, forming, land, bridges, between, land, masses, for, animals, to, migrate, during, deglaciation, the, melted, ice, water, returned, to, the, oceans, causing, sea, level, to, rise, this, process, can, cause, sudden, shifts, in, coastlines, and, hydration, systems, resulting, in, newly, submerged, lands, emerging, lands, collapsed, ice, dams, resulting, in, salination, of, lakes, new, ice, dams, creating, vast, areas, of, freshwater, and, a, general, alteration, in, regional, weather, patterns, on, a, large, but, temporary, scale, it, can, even, cause, temporary, reglaciation, this, type, of, chaotic, pattern, of, rapidly, changing, land, ice, saltwater, and, freshwater, has, been, proposed, as, the, likely, model, for, the, baltic, and, scandinavian, regions, as, well, as, much, of, central, north, america, at, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, maximum, with, the, present, day, coastlines, only, being, achieved, in, the, last, few, millennia, of, prehistory, also, the, effect, of, elevation, on, scandinavia, submerged, a, vast, continental, plain, that, had, existed, under, much, of, what, is, now, the, north, sea, connecting, the, british, isles, to, continental, europe, the, redistribution, of, ice, water, on, the, surface, of, earth, and, the, flow, of, mantle, rocks, causes, changes, in, the, gravitational, field, as, well, as, changes, to, the, distribution, of, the, moment, of, inertia, of, earth, these, changes, to, the, moment, of, inertia, result, in, a, change, in, the, angular, velocity, axis, and, wobble, of, earth, s, rotation, the, weight, of, the, redistributed, surface, mass, loaded, the, lithosphere, caused, it, to, flex, and, also, induced, stress, within, earth, the, presence, of, the, glaciers, generally, suppressed, the, movement, of, faults, below, during, deglaciation, the, faults, experience, accelerated, slip, triggering, earthquakes, earthquakes, triggered, near, the, ice, margin, may, in, turn, accelerate, ice, calving, and, may, account, for, the, heinrich, events, as, more, ice, is, removed, near, the, ice, margin, more, intraplate, earthquakes, are, induced, and, this, positive, feedback, may, explain, the, fast, collapse, of, ice, sheets, in, europe, glacial, erosion, and, isostatic, sinking, from, the, weight, of, ice, made, the, baltic, sea, which, before, the, ice, age, was, all, land, drained, by, the, eridanos, river, a, 2015, report, by, the, past, global, changes, project, says, simulations, show, that, a, new, glaciation, is, unlikely, to, happen, within, the, next, approximately, 50, 000, years, before, the, next, strong, drop, in, northern, hemisphere, summer, insolation, occurs, if, either, atmospheric, co, 2, concentration, remains, above, 300, ppm, or, cumulative, carbon, emissions, exceed, 1000, pg, c, i, e, 1, 000, gigatonnes, carbon, only, for, an, atmospheric, co, 2, content, below, the, preindustrial, level, may, a, glaciation, occur, within, the, next, 10, ka, given, the, continued, anthropogenic, co, 2, emissions, glacial, inception, is, very, unlikely, to, occur, in, the, next, 50, ka, because, the, timescale, for, co, 2, and, temperature, reduction, toward, unperturbed, values, in, the, absence, of, active, removal, is, very, long, and, only, weak, precessional, forcing, occurs, in, the, next, two, precessional, cycles, a, precessional, cycle, is, around, 21, 000, years, the, time, it, takes, for, the, perihelion, to, move, all, the, way, around, the, tropical, year, ice, ages, go, through, cycles, of, about, 100, 000, years, but, the, next, one, may, well, be, avoided, due, to, our, carbon, dioxide, emissions, hypothetical, runaway, greenhouse, state, tropical, temperatures, may, reach, poles, global, climate, during, an, ice, age, earth, s, surface, entirely, or, nearly, frozen, over
