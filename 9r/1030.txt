in, physics, string, theory, is, a, theoretical, framework, in, which, the, point, like, particles, of, particle, physics, are, replaced, by, one, dimensional, objects, called, strings, string, theory, describes, how, these, strings, propagate, through, space, and, interact, with, each, other, on, distance, scales, larger, than, the, string, scale, a, string, looks, just, like, an, ordinary, particle, with, its, mass, charge, and, other, properties, determined, by, the, vibrational, state, of, the, string, in, string, theory, one, of, the, many, vibrational, states, of, the, string, corresponds, to, the, graviton, a, quantum, mechanical, particle, that, carries, the, gravitational, force, thus, string, theory, is, a, theory, of, quantum, gravity, string, theory, is, a, broad, and, varied, subject, that, attempts, to, address, a, number, of, deep, questions, of, fundamental, physics, string, theory, has, contributed, a, number, of, advances, to, mathematical, physics, which, have, been, applied, to, a, variety, of, problems, in, black, hole, physics, early, universe, cosmology, nuclear, physics, and, condensed, matter, physics, and, it, has, stimulated, a, number, of, major, developments, in, pure, mathematics, because, string, theory, potentially, provides, a, unified, description, of, gravity, and, particle, physics, it, is, a, candidate, for, a, theory, of, everything, a, self, contained, mathematical, model, that, describes, all, fundamental, forces, and, forms, of, matter, despite, much, work, on, these, problems, it, is, not, known, to, what, extent, string, theory, describes, the, real, world, or, how, much, freedom, the, theory, allows, in, the, choice, of, its, details, string, theory, was, first, studied, in, the, late, 1960s, as, a, theory, of, the, strong, nuclear, force, before, being, abandoned, in, favor, of, quantum, chromodynamics, subsequently, it, was, realized, that, the, very, properties, that, made, string, theory, unsuitable, as, a, theory, of, nuclear, physics, made, it, a, promising, candidate, for, a, quantum, theory, of, gravity, the, earliest, version, of, string, theory, bosonic, string, theory, incorporated, only, the, class, of, particles, known, as, bosons, it, later, developed, into, superstring, theory, which, posits, a, connection, called, supersymmetry, between, bosons, and, the, class, of, particles, called, fermions, five, consistent, versions, of, superstring, theory, were, developed, before, it, was, conjectured, in, the, mid, 1990s, that, they, were, all, different, limiting, cases, of, a, single, theory, in, eleven, dimensions, known, as, m, theory, in, late, 1997, theorists, discovered, an, important, relationship, called, the, anti, de, sitter, conformal, field, theory, correspondence, ads, cft, correspondence, which, relates, string, theory, to, another, type, of, physical, theory, called, a, quantum, field, theory, one, of, the, challenges, of, string, theory, is, that, the, full, theory, does, not, have, a, satisfactory, definition, in, all, circumstances, another, issue, is, that, the, theory, is, thought, to, describe, an, enormous, landscape, of, possible, universes, which, has, complicated, efforts, to, develop, theories, of, particle, physics, based, on, string, theory, these, issues, have, led, some, in, the, community, to, criticize, these, approaches, to, physics, and, to, question, the, value, of, continued, research, on, string, theory, unification, in, the, 20th, century, two, theoretical, frameworks, emerged, for, formulating, the, laws, of, physics, the, first, is, albert, einstein, s, general, theory, of, relativity, a, theory, that, explains, the, force, of, gravity, and, the, structure, of, spacetime, at, the, macro, level, the, other, is, quantum, mechanics, a, completely, different, formulation, which, uses, known, probability, principles, to, describe, physical, phenomena, at, the, micro, level, by, the, late, 1970s, these, two, frameworks, had, proven, to, be, sufficient, to, explain, most, of, the, observed, features, of, the, universe, from, elementary, particles, to, atoms, to, the, evolution, of, stars, and, the, universe, as, a, whole, in, spite, of, these, successes, there, are, still, many, problems, that, remain, to, be, solved, one, of, the, deepest, problems, in, modern, physics, is, the, problem, of, quantum, gravity, the, general, theory, of, relativity, is, formulated, within, the, framework, of, classical, physics, whereas, the, other, fundamental, forces, are, described, within, the, framework, of, quantum, mechanics, a, quantum, theory, of, gravity, is, needed, in, order, to, reconcile, general, relativity, with, the, principles, of, quantum, mechanics, but, difficulties, arise, when, one, attempts, to, apply, the, usual, prescriptions, of, quantum, theory, to, the, force, of, gravity, in, addition, to, the, problem, of, developing, a, consistent, theory, of, quantum, gravity, there, are, many, other, fundamental, problems, in, the, physics, of, atomic, nuclei, black, holes, and, the, early, universe, string, theory, is, a, theoretical, framework, that, attempts, to, address, these, questions, and, many, others, the, starting, point, for, string, theory, is, the, idea, that, the, point, like, particles, of, particle, physics, can, also, be, modeled, as, one, dimensional, objects, called, strings, string, theory, describes, how, strings, propagate, through, space, and, interact, with, each, other, in, a, given, version, of, string, theory, there, is, only, one, kind, of, string, which, may, look, like, a, small, loop, or, segment, of, ordinary, string, and, it, can, vibrate, in, different, ways, on, distance, scales, larger, than, the, string, scale, a, string, will, look, just, like, an, ordinary, particle, consistent, with, non, string, models, of, elementary, particles, with, its, mass, charge, and, other, properties, determined, by, the, vibrational, state, of, the, string, string, theory, s, application, as, a, form, of, quantum, gravity, proposes, a, vibrational, state, responsible, for, the, graviton, a, yet, unproven, quantum, particle, that, is, theorized, to, carry, gravitational, force, one, of, the, main, developments, of, the, past, several, decades, in, string, theory, was, the, discovery, of, certain, dualities, mathematical, transformations, that, identify, one, physical, theory, with, another, physicists, studying, string, theory, have, discovered, a, number, of, these, dualities, between, different, versions, of, string, theory, and, this, has, led, to, the, conjecture, that, all, consistent, versions, of, string, theory, are, subsumed, in, a, single, framework, known, as, m, theory, studies, of, string, theory, have, also, yielded, a, number, of, results, on, the, nature, of, black, holes, and, the, gravitational, interaction, there, are, certain, paradoxes, that, arise, when, one, attempts, to, understand, the, quantum, aspects, of, black, holes, and, work, on, string, theory, has, attempted, to, clarify, these, issues, in, late, 1997, this, line, of, work, culminated, in, the, discovery, of, the, anti, de, sitter, conformal, field, theory, correspondence, or, ads, cft, this, is, a, theoretical, result, that, relates, string, theory, to, other, physical, theories, which, are, better, understood, theoretically, the, ads, cft, correspondence, has, implications, for, the, study, of, black, holes, and, quantum, gravity, and, it, has, been, applied, to, other, subjects, including, nuclear, and, condensed, matter, physics, since, string, theory, incorporates, all, of, the, fundamental, interactions, including, gravity, many, physicists, hope, that, it, will, eventually, be, developed, to, the, point, where, it, fully, describes, our, universe, making, it, a, theory, of, everything, one, of, the, goals, of, current, research, in, string, theory, is, to, find, a, solution, of, the, theory, that, reproduces, the, observed, spectrum, of, elementary, particles, with, a, small, cosmological, constant, containing, dark, matter, and, a, plausible, mechanism, for, cosmic, inflation, while, there, has, been, progress, toward, these, goals, it, is, not, known, to, what, extent, string, theory, describes, the, real, world, or, how, much, freedom, the, theory, allows, in, the, choice, of, details, one, of, the, challenges, of, string, theory, is, that, the, full, theory, does, not, have, a, satisfactory, definition, in, all, circumstances, the, scattering, of, strings, is, most, straightforwardly, defined, using, the, techniques, of, perturbation, theory, but, it, is, not, known, in, general, how, to, define, string, theory, nonperturbatively, it, is, also, not, clear, whether, there, is, any, principle, by, which, string, theory, selects, its, vacuum, state, the, physical, state, that, determines, the, properties, of, our, universe, these, problems, have, led, some, in, the, community, to, criticize, these, approaches, to, the, unification, of, physics, and, question, the, value, of, continued, research, on, these, problems, the, application, of, quantum, mechanics, to, physical, objects, such, as, the, electromagnetic, field, which, are, extended, in, space, and, time, is, known, as, quantum, field, theory, in, particle, physics, quantum, field, theories, form, the, basis, for, our, understanding, of, elementary, particles, which, are, modeled, as, excitations, in, the, fundamental, fields, in, quantum, field, theory, one, typically, computes, the, probabilities, of, various, physical, events, using, the, techniques, of, perturbation, theory, developed, by, richard, feynman, and, others, in, the, first, half, of, the, twentieth, century, perturbative, quantum, field, theory, uses, special, diagrams, called, feynman, diagrams, to, organize, computations, one, imagines, that, these, diagrams, depict, the, paths, of, point, like, particles, and, their, interactions, the, starting, point, for, string, theory, is, the, idea, that, the, point, like, particles, of, quantum, field, theory, can, also, be, modeled, as, one, dimensional, objects, called, strings, the, interaction, of, strings, is, most, straightforwardly, defined, by, generalizing, the, perturbation, theory, used, in, ordinary, quantum, field, theory, at, the, level, of, feynman, diagrams, this, means, replacing, the, one, dimensional, diagram, representing, the, path, of, a, point, particle, by, a, two, dimensional, 2d, surface, representing, the, motion, of, a, string, unlike, in, quantum, field, theory, string, theory, does, not, have, a, full, non, perturbative, definition, so, many, of, the, theoretical, questions, that, physicists, would, like, to, answer, remain, out, of, reach, in, theories, of, particle, physics, based, on, string, theory, the, characteristic, length, scale, of, strings, is, assumed, to, be, on, the, order, of, the, planck, length, or, 10, 35, meters, the, scale, at, which, the, effects, of, quantum, gravity, are, believed, to, become, significant, on, much, larger, length, scales, such, as, the, scales, visible, in, physics, laboratories, such, objects, would, be, indistinguishable, from, zero, dimensional, point, particles, and, the, vibrational, state, of, the, string, would, determine, the, type, of, particle, one, of, the, vibrational, states, of, a, string, corresponds, to, the, graviton, a, quantum, mechanical, particle, that, carries, the, gravitational, force, the, original, version, of, string, theory, was, bosonic, string, theory, but, this, version, described, only, bosons, a, class, of, particles, that, transmit, forces, between, the, matter, particles, or, fermions, bosonic, string, theory, was, eventually, superseded, by, theories, called, superstring, theories, these, theories, describe, both, bosons, and, fermions, and, they, incorporate, a, theoretical, idea, called, supersymmetry, in, theories, with, supersymmetry, each, boson, has, a, counterpart, which, is, a, fermion, and, vice, versa, there, are, several, versions, of, superstring, theory, type, i, type, iia, type, iib, and, two, flavors, of, heterotic, string, theory, so, 32, and, e, 8, e, 8, the, different, theories, allow, different, types, of, strings, and, the, particles, that, arise, at, low, energies, exhibit, different, symmetries, for, example, the, type, i, theory, includes, both, open, strings, which, are, segments, with, endpoints, and, closed, strings, which, form, closed, loops, while, types, iia, iib, and, heterotic, include, only, closed, strings, in, everyday, life, there, are, three, familiar, dimensions, 3d, of, space, height, width, and, length, einstein, s, general, theory, of, relativity, treats, time, as, a, dimension, on, par, with, the, three, spatial, dimensions, in, general, relativity, space, and, time, are, not, modeled, as, separate, entities, but, are, instead, unified, to, a, four, dimensional, 4d, spacetime, in, this, framework, the, phenomenon, of, gravity, is, viewed, as, a, consequence, of, the, geometry, of, spacetime, in, spite, of, the, fact, that, the, universe, is, well, described, by, 4d, spacetime, there, are, several, reasons, why, physicists, consider, theories, in, other, dimensions, in, some, cases, by, modeling, spacetime, in, a, different, number, of, dimensions, a, theory, becomes, more, mathematically, tractable, and, one, can, perform, calculations, and, gain, general, insights, more, easily, there, are, also, situations, where, theories, in, two, or, three, spacetime, dimensions, are, useful, for, describing, phenomena, in, condensed, matter, physics, finally, there, exist, scenarios, in, which, there, could, actually, be, more, than, 4d, of, spacetime, which, have, nonetheless, managed, to, escape, detection, string, theories, require, extra, dimensions, of, spacetime, for, their, mathematical, consistency, in, bosonic, string, theory, spacetime, is, 26, dimensional, while, in, superstring, theory, it, is, 10, dimensional, and, in, m, theory, it, is, 11, dimensional, in, order, to, describe, real, physical, phenomena, using, string, theory, one, must, therefore, imagine, scenarios, in, which, these, extra, dimensions, would, not, be, observed, in, experiments, compactification, is, one, way, of, modifying, the, number, of, dimensions, in, a, physical, theory, in, compactification, some, of, the, extra, dimensions, are, assumed, to, close, up, on, themselves, to, form, circles, in, the, limit, where, these, curled, up, dimensions, become, very, small, one, obtains, a, theory, in, which, spacetime, has, effectively, a, lower, number, of, dimensions, a, standard, analogy, for, this, is, to, consider, a, multidimensional, object, such, as, a, garden, hose, if, the, hose, is, viewed, from, a, sufficient, distance, it, appears, to, have, only, one, dimension, its, length, however, as, one, approaches, the, hose, one, discovers, that, it, contains, a, second, dimension, its, circumference, thus, an, ant, crawling, on, the, surface, of, the, hose, would, move, in, two, dimensions, compactification, can, be, used, to, construct, models, in, which, spacetime, is, effectively, four, dimensional, however, not, every, way, of, compactifying, the, extra, dimensions, produces, a, model, with, the, right, properties, to, describe, nature, in, a, viable, model, of, particle, physics, the, compact, extra, dimensions, must, be, shaped, like, a, calabi, yau, manifold, a, calabi, yau, manifold, is, a, special, space, which, is, typically, taken, to, be, six, dimensional, in, applications, to, string, theory, it, is, named, after, mathematicians, eugenio, calabi, and, shing, tung, yau, another, approach, to, reducing, the, number, of, dimensions, is, the, so, called, brane, world, scenario, in, this, approach, physicists, assume, that, the, observable, universe, is, a, four, dimensional, subspace, of, a, higher, dimensional, space, in, such, models, the, force, carrying, bosons, of, particle, physics, arise, from, open, strings, with, endpoints, attached, to, the, four, dimensional, subspace, while, gravity, arises, from, closed, strings, propagating, through, the, larger, ambient, space, this, idea, plays, an, important, role, in, attempts, to, develop, models, of, real, world, physics, based, on, string, theory, and, it, provides, a, natural, explanation, for, the, weakness, of, gravity, compared, to, the, other, fundamental, forces, a, notable, fact, about, string, theory, is, that, the, different, versions, of, the, theory, all, turn, out, to, be, related, in, highly, nontrivial, ways, one, of, the, relationships, that, can, exist, between, different, string, theories, is, called, s, duality, this, is, a, relationship, that, says, that, a, collection, of, strongly, interacting, particles, in, one, theory, can, in, some, cases, be, viewed, as, a, collection, of, weakly, interacting, particles, in, a, completely, different, theory, roughly, speaking, a, collection, of, particles, is, said, to, be, strongly, interacting, if, they, combine, and, decay, often, and, weakly, interacting, if, they, do, so, infrequently, type, i, string, theory, turns, out, to, be, equivalent, by, s, duality, to, the, so, 32, heterotic, string, theory, similarly, type, iib, string, theory, is, related, to, itself, in, a, nontrivial, way, by, s, duality, another, relationship, between, different, string, theories, is, t, duality, here, one, considers, strings, propagating, around, a, circular, extra, dimension, t, duality, states, that, a, string, propagating, around, a, circle, of, radius, r, is, equivalent, to, a, string, propagating, around, a, circle, of, radius, 1, r, in, the, sense, that, all, observable, quantities, in, one, description, are, identified, with, quantities, in, the, dual, description, for, example, a, string, has, momentum, as, it, propagates, around, a, circle, and, it, can, also, wind, around, the, circle, one, or, more, times, the, number, of, times, the, string, winds, around, a, circle, is, called, the, winding, number, if, a, string, has, momentum, p, and, winding, number, n, in, one, description, it, will, have, momentum, n, and, winding, number, p, in, the, dual, description, for, example, type, iia, string, theory, is, equivalent, to, type, iib, string, theory, via, t, duality, and, the, two, versions, of, heterotic, string, theory, are, also, related, by, t, duality, in, general, the, term, duality, refers, to, a, situation, where, two, seemingly, different, physical, systems, turn, out, to, be, equivalent, in, a, nontrivial, way, two, theories, related, by, a, duality, need, not, be, string, theories, for, example, montonen, olive, duality, is, an, example, of, an, s, duality, relationship, between, quantum, field, theories, the, ads, cft, correspondence, is, an, example, of, a, duality, that, relates, string, theory, to, a, quantum, field, theory, if, two, theories, are, related, by, a, duality, it, means, that, one, theory, can, be, transformed, in, some, way, so, that, it, ends, up, looking, just, like, the, other, theory, the, two, theories, are, then, said, to, be, dual, to, one, another, under, the, transformation, put, differently, the, two, theories, are, mathematically, different, descriptions, of, the, same, phenomena, in, string, theory, and, other, related, theories, a, brane, is, a, physical, object, that, generalizes, the, notion, of, a, point, particle, to, higher, dimensions, for, instance, a, point, particle, can, be, viewed, as, a, brane, of, dimension, zero, while, a, string, can, be, viewed, as, a, brane, of, dimension, one, it, is, also, possible, to, consider, higher, dimensional, branes, in, dimension, p, these, are, called, p, branes, the, word, brane, comes, from, the, word, membrane, which, refers, to, a, two, dimensional, brane, branes, are, dynamical, objects, which, can, propagate, through, spacetime, according, to, the, rules, of, quantum, mechanics, they, have, mass, and, can, have, other, attributes, such, as, charge, a, p, brane, sweeps, out, a, p, 1, dimensional, volume, in, spacetime, called, its, worldvolume, physicists, often, study, fields, analogous, to, the, electromagnetic, field, which, live, on, the, worldvolume, of, a, brane, in, string, theory, d, branes, are, an, important, class, of, branes, that, arise, when, one, considers, open, strings, as, an, open, string, propagates, through, spacetime, its, endpoints, are, required, to, lie, on, a, d, brane, the, letter, d, in, d, brane, refers, to, a, certain, mathematical, condition, on, the, system, known, as, the, dirichlet, boundary, condition, the, study, of, d, branes, in, string, theory, has, led, to, important, results, such, as, the, ads, cft, correspondence, which, has, shed, light, on, many, problems, in, quantum, field, theory, branes, are, frequently, studied, from, a, purely, mathematical, point, of, view, and, they, are, described, as, objects, of, certain, categories, such, as, the, derived, category, of, coherent, sheaves, on, a, complex, algebraic, variety, or, the, fukaya, category, of, a, symplectic, manifold, the, connection, between, the, physical, notion, of, a, brane, and, the, mathematical, notion, of, a, category, has, led, to, important, mathematical, insights, in, the, fields, of, algebraic, and, symplectic, geometry, and, representation, theory, prior, to, 1995, theorists, believed, that, there, were, five, consistent, versions, of, superstring, theory, type, i, type, iia, type, iib, and, two, versions, of, heterotic, string, theory, this, understanding, changed, in, 1995, when, edward, witten, suggested, that, the, five, theories, were, just, special, limiting, cases, of, an, eleven, dimensional, theory, called, m, theory, witten, s, conjecture, was, based, on, the, work, of, a, number, of, other, physicists, including, ashoke, sen, chris, hull, paul, townsend, and, michael, duff, his, announcement, led, to, a, flurry, of, research, activity, now, known, as, the, second, superstring, revolution, in, the, 1970s, many, physicists, became, interested, in, supergravity, theories, which, combine, general, relativity, with, supersymmetry, whereas, general, relativity, makes, sense, in, any, number, of, dimensions, supergravity, places, an, upper, limit, on, the, number, of, dimensions, in, 1978, work, by, werner, nahm, showed, that, the, maximum, spacetime, dimension, in, which, one, can, formulate, a, consistent, supersymmetric, theory, is, eleven, in, the, same, year, eugene, cremmer, bernard, julia, and, jo, l, scherk, of, the, cole, normale, sup, rieure, showed, that, supergravity, not, only, permits, up, to, eleven, dimensions, but, is, in, fact, most, elegant, in, this, maximal, number, of, dimensions, initially, many, physicists, hoped, that, by, compactifying, eleven, dimensional, supergravity, it, might, be, possible, to, construct, realistic, models, of, our, four, dimensional, world, the, hope, was, that, such, models, would, provide, a, unified, description, of, the, four, fundamental, forces, of, nature, electromagnetism, the, strong, and, weak, nuclear, forces, and, gravity, interest, in, eleven, dimensional, supergravity, soon, waned, as, various, flaws, in, this, scheme, were, discovered, one, of, the, problems, was, that, the, laws, of, physics, appear, to, distinguish, between, clockwise, and, counterclockwise, a, phenomenon, known, as, chirality, edward, witten, and, others, observed, this, chirality, property, cannot, be, readily, derived, by, compactifying, from, eleven, dimensions, in, the, first, superstring, revolution, in, 1984, many, physicists, turned, to, string, theory, as, a, unified, theory, of, particle, physics, and, quantum, gravity, unlike, supergravity, theory, string, theory, was, able, to, accommodate, the, chirality, of, the, standard, model, and, it, provided, a, theory, of, gravity, consistent, with, quantum, effects, another, feature, of, string, theory, that, many, physicists, were, drawn, to, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, was, its, high, degree, of, uniqueness, in, ordinary, particle, theories, one, can, consider, any, collection, of, elementary, particles, whose, classical, behavior, is, described, by, an, arbitrary, lagrangian, in, string, theory, the, possibilities, are, much, more, constrained, by, the, 1990s, physicists, had, argued, that, there, were, only, five, consistent, supersymmetric, versions, of, the, theory, although, there, were, only, a, handful, of, consistent, superstring, theories, it, remained, a, mystery, why, there, was, not, just, one, consistent, formulation, however, as, physicists, began, to, examine, string, theory, more, closely, they, realized, that, these, theories, are, related, in, intricate, and, nontrivial, ways, they, found, that, a, system, of, strongly, interacting, strings, can, in, some, cases, be, viewed, as, a, system, of, weakly, interacting, strings, this, phenomenon, is, known, as, s, duality, it, was, studied, by, ashoke, sen, in, the, context, of, heterotic, strings, in, four, dimensions, and, by, chris, hull, and, paul, townsend, in, the, context, of, the, type, iib, theory, theorists, also, found, that, different, string, theories, may, be, related, by, t, duality, this, duality, implies, that, strings, propagating, on, completely, different, spacetime, geometries, may, be, physically, equivalent, at, around, the, same, time, as, many, physicists, were, studying, the, properties, of, strings, a, small, group, of, physicists, were, examining, the, possible, applications, of, higher, dimensional, objects, in, 1987, eric, bergshoeff, ergin, sezgin, and, paul, townsend, showed, that, eleven, dimensional, supergravity, includes, two, dimensional, branes, intuitively, these, objects, look, like, sheets, or, membranes, propagating, through, the, eleven, dimensional, spacetime, shortly, after, this, discovery, michael, duff, paul, howe, takeo, inami, and, kellogg, stelle, considered, a, particular, compactification, of, eleven, dimensional, supergravity, with, one, of, the, dimensions, curled, up, into, a, circle, in, this, setting, one, can, imagine, the, membrane, wrapping, around, the, circular, dimension, if, the, radius, of, the, circle, is, sufficiently, small, then, this, membrane, looks, just, like, a, string, in, ten, dimensional, spacetime, duff, and, his, collaborators, showed, that, this, construction, reproduces, exactly, the, strings, appearing, in, type, iia, superstring, theory, speaking, at, a, string, theory, conference, in, 1995, edward, witten, made, the, surprising, suggestion, that, all, five, superstring, theories, were, in, fact, just, different, limiting, cases, of, a, single, theory, in, eleven, spacetime, dimensions, witten, s, announcement, drew, together, all, of, the, previous, results, on, s, and, t, duality, and, the, appearance, of, higher, dimensional, branes, in, string, theory, in, the, months, following, witten, s, announcement, hundreds, of, new, papers, appeared, on, the, internet, confirming, different, parts, of, his, proposal, today, this, flurry, of, work, is, known, as, the, second, superstring, revolution, initially, some, physicists, suggested, that, the, new, theory, was, a, fundamental, theory, of, membranes, but, witten, was, skeptical, of, the, role, of, membranes, in, the, theory, in, a, paper, from, 1996, ho, ava, and, witten, wrote, as, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, eleven, dimensional, theory, is, a, supermembrane, theory, but, there, are, some, reasons, to, doubt, that, interpretation, we, will, non, committally, call, it, the, m, theory, leaving, to, the, future, the, relation, of, m, to, membranes, in, the, absence, of, an, understanding, of, the, true, meaning, and, structure, of, m, theory, witten, has, suggested, that, the, m, should, stand, for, magic, mystery, or, membrane, according, to, taste, and, the, true, meaning, of, the, title, should, be, decided, when, a, more, fundamental, formulation, of, the, theory, is, known, in, mathematics, a, matrix, is, a, rectangular, array, of, numbers, or, other, data, in, physics, a, matrix, model, is, a, particular, kind, of, physical, theory, whose, mathematical, formulation, involves, the, notion, of, a, matrix, in, an, important, way, a, matrix, model, describes, the, behavior, of, a, set, of, matrices, within, the, framework, of, quantum, mechanics, one, important, example, of, a, matrix, model, is, the, bfss, matrix, model, proposed, by, tom, banks, willy, fischler, stephen, shenker, and, leonard, susskind, in, 1997, this, theory, describes, the, behavior, of, a, set, of, nine, large, matrices, in, their, original, paper, these, authors, showed, among, other, things, that, the, low, energy, limit, of, this, matrix, model, is, described, by, eleven, dimensional, supergravity, these, calculations, led, them, to, propose, that, the, bfss, matrix, model, is, exactly, equivalent, to, m, theory, the, bfss, matrix, model, can, therefore, be, used, as, a, prototype, for, a, correct, formulation, of, m, theory, and, a, tool, for, investigating, the, properties, of, m, theory, in, a, relatively, simple, setting, the, development, of, the, matrix, model, formulation, of, m, theory, has, led, physicists, to, consider, various, connections, between, string, theory, and, a, branch, of, mathematics, called, noncommutative, geometry, this, subject, is, a, generalization, of, ordinary, geometry, in, which, mathematicians, define, new, geometric, notions, using, tools, from, noncommutative, algebra, in, a, paper, from, 1998, alain, connes, michael, r, douglas, and, albert, schwarz, showed, that, some, aspects, of, matrix, models, and, m, theory, are, described, by, a, noncommutative, quantum, field, theory, a, special, kind, of, physical, theory, in, which, spacetime, is, described, mathematically, using, noncommutative, geometry, this, established, a, link, between, matrix, models, and, m, theory, on, the, one, hand, and, noncommutative, geometry, on, the, other, hand, it, quickly, led, to, the, discovery, of, other, important, links, between, noncommutative, geometry, and, various, physical, theories, in, general, relativity, a, black, hole, is, defined, as, a, region, of, spacetime, in, which, the, gravitational, field, is, so, strong, that, no, particle, or, radiation, can, escape, in, the, currently, accepted, models, of, stellar, evolution, black, holes, are, thought, to, arise, when, massive, stars, undergo, gravitational, collapse, and, many, galaxies, are, thought, to, contain, supermassive, black, holes, at, their, centers, black, holes, are, also, important, for, theoretical, reasons, as, they, present, profound, challenges, for, theorists, attempting, to, understand, the, quantum, aspects, of, gravity, string, theory, has, proved, to, be, an, important, tool, for, investigating, the, theoretical, properties, of, black, holes, because, it, provides, a, framework, in, which, theorists, can, study, their, thermodynamics, in, the, branch, of, physics, called, statistical, mechanics, entropy, is, a, measure, of, the, randomness, or, disorder, of, a, physical, system, this, concept, was, studied, in, the, 1870s, by, the, austrian, physicist, ludwig, boltzmann, who, showed, that, the, thermodynamic, properties, of, a, gas, could, be, derived, from, the, combined, properties, of, its, many, constituent, molecules, boltzmann, argued, that, by, averaging, the, behaviors, of, all, the, different, molecules, in, a, gas, one, can, understand, macroscopic, properties, such, as, volume, temperature, and, pressure, in, addition, this, perspective, led, him, to, give, a, precise, definition, of, entropy, as, the, natural, logarithm, of, the, number, of, different, states, of, the, molecules, also, called, microstates, that, give, rise, to, the, same, macroscopic, features, in, the, twentieth, century, physicists, began, to, apply, the, same, concepts, to, black, holes, in, most, systems, such, as, gases, the, entropy, scales, with, the, volume, in, the, 1970s, the, physicist, jacob, bekenstein, suggested, that, the, entropy, of, a, black, hole, is, instead, proportional, to, the, surface, area, of, its, event, horizon, the, boundary, beyond, which, matter, and, radiation, are, lost, to, its, gravitational, attraction, when, combined, with, ideas, of, the, physicist, stephen, hawking, bekenstein, s, work, yielded, a, precise, formula, for, the, entropy, of, a, black, hole, the, bekenstein, hawking, formula, expresses, the, entropy, s, as, where, c, is, the, speed, of, light, k, is, the, boltzmann, constant, is, the, reduced, planck, constant, g, is, newton, s, constant, and, a, is, the, surface, area, of, the, event, horizon, like, any, physical, system, a, black, hole, has, an, entropy, defined, in, terms, of, the, number, of, different, microstates, that, lead, to, the, same, macroscopic, features, the, bekenstein, hawking, entropy, formula, gives, the, expected, value, of, the, entropy, of, a, black, hole, but, by, the, 1990s, physicists, still, lacked, a, derivation, of, this, formula, by, counting, microstates, in, a, theory, of, quantum, gravity, finding, such, a, derivation, of, this, formula, was, considered, an, important, test, of, the, viability, of, any, theory, of, quantum, gravity, such, as, string, theory, in, a, paper, from, 1996, andrew, strominger, and, cumrun, vafa, showed, how, to, derive, the, bekenstein, hawking, formula, for, certain, black, holes, in, string, theory, their, calculation, was, based, on, the, observation, that, d, branes, which, look, like, fluctuating, membranes, when, they, are, weakly, interacting, become, dense, massive, objects, with, event, horizons, when, the, interactions, are, strong, in, other, words, a, system, of, strongly, interacting, d, branes, in, string, theory, is, indistinguishable, from, a, black, hole, strominger, and, vafa, analyzed, such, d, brane, systems, and, calculated, the, number, of, different, ways, of, placing, d, branes, in, spacetime, so, that, their, combined, mass, and, charge, is, equal, to, a, given, mass, and, charge, for, the, resulting, black, hole, their, calculation, reproduced, the, bekenstein, hawking, formula, exactly, including, the, factor, of, 1, 4, subsequent, work, by, strominger, vafa, and, others, refined, the, original, calculations, and, gave, the, precise, values, of, the, quantum, corrections, needed, to, describe, very, small, black, holes, the, black, holes, that, strominger, and, vafa, considered, in, their, original, work, were, quite, different, from, real, astrophysical, black, holes, one, difference, was, that, strominger, and, vafa, considered, only, extremal, black, holes, in, order, to, make, the, calculation, tractable, these, are, defined, as, black, holes, with, the, lowest, possible, mass, compatible, with, a, given, charge, strominger, and, vafa, also, restricted, attention, to, black, holes, in, five, dimensional, spacetime, with, unphysical, supersymmetry, although, it, was, originally, developed, in, this, very, particular, and, physically, unrealistic, context, in, string, theory, the, entropy, calculation, of, strominger, and, vafa, has, led, to, a, qualitative, understanding, of, how, black, hole, entropy, can, be, accounted, for, in, any, theory, of, quantum, gravity, indeed, in, 1998, strominger, argued, that, the, original, result, could, be, generalized, to, an, arbitrary, consistent, theory, of, quantum, gravity, without, relying, on, strings, or, supersymmetry, in, collaboration, with, several, other, authors, in, 2010, he, showed, that, some, results, on, black, hole, entropy, could, be, extended, to, non, extremal, astrophysical, black, holes, one, approach, to, formulating, string, theory, and, studying, its, properties, is, provided, by, the, anti, de, sitter, conformal, field, theory, ads, cft, correspondence, this, is, a, theoretical, result, which, implies, that, string, theory, is, in, some, cases, equivalent, to, a, quantum, field, theory, in, addition, to, providing, insights, into, the, mathematical, structure, of, string, theory, the, ads, cft, correspondence, has, shed, light, on, many, aspects, of, quantum, field, theory, in, regimes, where, traditional, calculational, techniques, are, ineffective, the, ads, cft, correspondence, was, first, proposed, by, juan, maldacena, in, late, 1997, important, aspects, of, the, correspondence, were, elaborated, in, articles, by, steven, gubser, igor, klebanov, and, alexander, markovich, polyakov, and, by, edward, witten, by, 2010, maldacena, s, article, had, over, 7000, citations, becoming, the, most, highly, cited, article, in, the, field, of, high, energy, physics, in, the, ads, cft, correspondence, the, geometry, of, spacetime, is, described, in, terms, of, a, certain, vacuum, solution, of, einstein, s, equation, called, anti, de, sitter, space, in, very, elementary, terms, anti, de, sitter, space, is, a, mathematical, model, of, spacetime, in, which, the, notion, of, distance, between, points, the, metric, is, different, from, the, notion, of, distance, in, ordinary, euclidean, geometry, it, is, closely, related, to, hyperbolic, space, which, can, be, viewed, as, a, disk, as, illustrated, on, the, left, this, image, shows, a, tessellation, of, a, disk, by, triangles, and, squares, one, can, define, the, distance, between, points, of, this, disk, in, such, a, way, that, all, the, triangles, and, squares, are, the, same, size, and, the, circular, outer, boundary, is, infinitely, far, from, any, point, in, the, interior, one, can, imagine, a, stack, of, hyperbolic, disks, where, each, disk, represents, the, state, of, the, universe, at, a, given, time, the, resulting, geometric, object, is, three, dimensional, anti, de, sitter, space, it, looks, like, a, solid, cylinder, in, which, any, cross, section, is, a, copy, of, the, hyperbolic, disk, time, runs, along, the, vertical, direction, in, this, picture, the, surface, of, this, cylinder, plays, an, important, role, in, the, ads, cft, correspondence, as, with, the, hyperbolic, plane, anti, de, sitter, space, is, curved, in, such, a, way, that, any, point, in, the, interior, is, actually, infinitely, far, from, this, boundary, surface, this, construction, describes, a, hypothetical, universe, with, only, two, space, dimensions, and, one, time, dimension, but, it, can, be, generalized, to, any, number, of, dimensions, indeed, hyperbolic, space, can, have, more, than, two, dimensions, and, one, can, stack, up, copies, of, hyperbolic, space, to, get, higher, dimensional, models, of, anti, de, sitter, space, an, important, feature, of, anti, de, sitter, space, is, its, boundary, which, looks, like, a, cylinder, in, the, case, of, three, dimensional, anti, de, sitter, space, one, property, of, this, boundary, is, that, within, a, small, region, on, the, surface, around, any, given, point, it, looks, just, like, minkowski, space, the, model, of, spacetime, used, in, nongravitational, physics, one, can, therefore, consider, an, auxiliary, theory, in, which, spacetime, is, given, by, the, boundary, of, anti, de, sitter, space, this, observation, is, the, starting, point, for, ads, cft, correspondence, which, states, that, the, boundary, of, anti, de, sitter, space, can, be, regarded, as, the, spacetime, for, a, quantum, field, theory, the, claim, is, that, this, quantum, field, theory, is, equivalent, to, a, gravitational, theory, such, as, string, theory, in, the, bulk, anti, de, sitter, space, in, the, sense, that, there, is, a, dictionary, for, translating, entities, and, calculations, in, one, theory, into, their, counterparts, in, the, other, theory, for, example, a, single, particle, in, the, gravitational, theory, might, correspond, to, some, collection, of, particles, in, the, boundary, theory, in, addition, the, predictions, in, the, two, theories, are, quantitatively, identical, so, that, if, two, particles, have, a, 40, percent, chance, of, colliding, in, the, gravitational, theory, then, the, corresponding, collections, in, the, boundary, theory, would, also, have, a, 40, percent, chance, of, colliding, the, discovery, of, the, ads, cft, correspondence, was, a, major, advance, in, physicists, understanding, of, string, theory, and, quantum, gravity, one, reason, for, this, is, that, the, correspondence, provides, a, formulation, of, string, theory, in, terms, of, quantum, field, theory, which, is, well, understood, by, comparison, another, reason, is, that, it, provides, a, general, framework, in, which, physicists, can, study, and, attempt, to, resolve, the, paradoxes, of, black, holes, in, 1975, stephen, hawking, published, a, calculation, which, suggested, that, black, holes, are, not, completely, black, but, emit, a, dim, radiation, due, to, quantum, effects, near, the, event, horizon, at, first, hawking, s, result, posed, a, problem, for, theorists, because, it, suggested, that, black, holes, destroy, information, more, precisely, hawking, s, calculation, seemed, to, conflict, with, one, of, the, basic, postulates, of, quantum, mechanics, which, states, that, physical, systems, evolve, in, time, according, to, the, schr, dinger, equation, this, property, is, usually, referred, to, as, unitarity, of, time, evolution, the, apparent, contradiction, between, hawking, s, calculation, and, the, unitarity, postulate, of, quantum, mechanics, came, to, be, known, as, the, black, hole, information, paradox, the, ads, cft, correspondence, resolves, the, black, hole, information, paradox, at, least, to, some, extent, because, it, shows, how, a, black, hole, can, evolve, in, a, manner, consistent, with, quantum, mechanics, in, some, contexts, indeed, one, can, consider, black, holes, in, the, context, of, the, ads, cft, correspondence, and, any, such, black, hole, corresponds, to, a, configuration, of, particles, on, the, boundary, of, anti, de, sitter, space, these, particles, obey, the, usual, rules, of, quantum, mechanics, and, in, particular, evolve, in, a, unitary, fashion, so, the, black, hole, must, also, evolve, in, a, unitary, fashion, respecting, the, principles, of, quantum, mechanics, in, 2005, hawking, announced, that, the, paradox, had, been, settled, in, favor, of, information, conservation, by, the, ads, cft, correspondence, and, he, suggested, a, concrete, mechanism, by, which, black, holes, might, preserve, information, in, addition, to, its, applications, to, theoretical, problems, in, quantum, gravity, the, ads, cft, correspondence, has, been, applied, to, a, variety, of, problems, in, quantum, field, theory, one, physical, system, that, has, been, studied, using, the, ads, cft, correspondence, is, the, quark, gluon, plasma, an, exotic, state, of, matter, produced, in, particle, accelerators, this, state, of, matter, arises, for, brief, instants, when, heavy, ions, such, as, gold, or, lead, nuclei, are, collided, at, high, energies, such, collisions, cause, the, quarks, that, make, up, atomic, nuclei, to, deconfine, at, temperatures, of, approximately, two, trillion, kelvin, conditions, similar, to, those, present, at, around, 10, 11, seconds, after, the, big, bang, the, physics, of, the, quark, gluon, plasma, is, governed, by, a, theory, called, quantum, chromodynamics, but, this, theory, is, mathematically, intractable, in, problems, involving, the, quark, gluon, plasma, in, an, article, appearing, in, 2005, m, thanh, s, n, and, his, collaborators, showed, that, the, ads, cft, correspondence, could, be, used, to, understand, some, aspects, of, the, quark, gluon, plasma, by, describing, it, in, the, language, of, string, theory, by, applying, the, ads, cft, correspondence, s, n, and, his, collaborators, were, able, to, describe, the, quark, gluon, plasma, in, terms, of, black, holes, in, five, dimensional, spacetime, the, calculation, showed, that, the, ratio, of, two, quantities, associated, with, the, quark, gluon, plasma, the, shear, viscosity, and, volume, density, of, entropy, should, be, approximately, equal, to, a, certain, universal, constant, in, 2008, the, predicted, value, of, this, ratio, for, the, quark, gluon, plasma, was, confirmed, at, the, relativistic, heavy, ion, collider, at, brookhaven, national, laboratory, the, ads, cft, correspondence, has, also, been, used, to, study, aspects, of, condensed, matter, physics, over, the, decades, experimental, condensed, matter, physicists, have, discovered, a, number, of, exotic, states, of, matter, including, superconductors, and, superfluids, these, states, are, described, using, the, formalism, of, quantum, field, theory, but, some, phenomena, are, difficult, to, explain, using, standard, field, theoretic, techniques, some, condensed, matter, theorists, including, subir, sachdev, hope, that, the, ads, cft, correspondence, will, make, it, possible, to, describe, these, systems, in, the, language, of, string, theory, and, learn, more, about, their, behavior, so, far, some, success, has, been, achieved, in, using, string, theory, methods, to, describe, the, transition, of, a, superfluid, to, an, insulator, a, superfluid, is, a, system, of, electrically, neutral, atoms, that, flows, without, any, friction, such, systems, are, often, produced, in, the, laboratory, using, liquid, helium, but, recently, experimentalists, have, developed, new, ways, of, producing, artificial, superfluids, by, pouring, trillions, of, cold, atoms, into, a, lattice, of, criss, crossing, lasers, these, atoms, initially, behave, as, a, superfluid, but, as, experimentalists, increase, the, intensity, of, the, lasers, they, become, less, mobile, and, then, suddenly, transition, to, an, insulating, state, during, the, transition, the, atoms, behave, in, an, unusual, way, for, example, the, atoms, slow, to, a, halt, at, a, rate, that, depends, on, the, temperature, and, on, the, planck, constant, the, fundamental, parameter, of, quantum, mechanics, which, does, not, enter, into, the, description, of, the, other, phases, this, behavior, has, recently, been, understood, by, considering, a, dual, description, where, properties, of, the, fluid, are, described, in, terms, of, a, higher, dimensional, black, hole, in, addition, to, being, an, idea, of, considerable, theoretical, interest, string, theory, provides, a, framework, for, constructing, models, of, real, world, physics, that, combine, general, relativity, and, particle, physics, phenomenology, is, the, branch, of, theoretical, physics, in, which, physicists, construct, realistic, models, of, nature, from, more, abstract, theoretical, ideas, string, phenomenology, is, the, part, of, string, theory, that, attempts, to, construct, realistic, or, semi, realistic, models, based, on, string, theory, partly, because, of, theoretical, and, mathematical, difficulties, and, partly, because, of, the, extremely, high, energies, needed, to, test, these, theories, experimentally, there, is, so, far, no, experimental, evidence, that, would, unambiguously, point, to, any, of, these, models, being, a, correct, fundamental, description, of, nature, this, has, led, some, in, the, community, to, criticize, these, approaches, to, unification, and, question, the, value, of, continued, research, on, these, problems, the, currently, accepted, theory, describing, elementary, particles, and, their, interactions, is, known, as, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, this, theory, provides, a, unified, description, of, three, of, the, fundamental, forces, of, nature, electromagnetism, and, the, strong, and, weak, nuclear, forces, despite, its, remarkable, success, in, explaining, a, wide, range, of, physical, phenomena, the, standard, model, cannot, be, a, complete, description, of, reality, this, is, because, the, standard, model, fails, to, incorporate, the, force, of, gravity, and, because, of, problems, such, as, the, hierarchy, problem, and, the, inability, to, explain, the, structure, of, fermion, masses, or, dark, matter, string, theory, has, been, used, to, construct, a, variety, of, models, of, particle, physics, going, beyond, the, standard, model, typically, such, models, are, based, on, the, idea, of, compactification, starting, with, the, ten, or, eleven, dimensional, spacetime, of, string, or, m, theory, physicists, postulate, a, shape, for, the, extra, dimensions, by, choosing, this, shape, appropriately, they, can, construct, models, roughly, similar, to, the, standard, model, of, particle, physics, together, with, additional, undiscovered, particles, one, popular, way, of, deriving, realistic, physics, from, string, theory, is, to, start, with, the, heterotic, theory, in, ten, dimensions, and, assume, that, the, six, extra, dimensions, of, spacetime, are, shaped, like, a, six, dimensional, calabi, yau, manifold, such, compactifications, offer, many, ways, of, extracting, realistic, physics, from, string, theory, other, similar, methods, can, be, used, to, construct, realistic, or, semi, realistic, models, of, our, four, dimensional, world, based, on, m, theory, the, big, bang, theory, is, the, prevailing, cosmological, model, for, the, universe, from, the, earliest, known, periods, through, its, subsequent, large, scale, evolution, despite, its, success, in, explaining, many, observed, features, of, the, universe, including, galactic, redshifts, the, relative, abundance, of, light, elements, such, as, hydrogen, and, helium, and, the, existence, of, a, cosmic, microwave, background, there, are, several, questions, that, remain, unanswered, for, example, the, standard, big, bang, model, does, not, explain, why, the, universe, appears, to, be, the, same, in, all, directions, why, it, appears, flat, on, very, large, distance, scales, or, why, certain, hypothesized, particles, such, as, magnetic, monopoles, are, not, observed, in, experiments, currently, the, leading, candidate, for, a, theory, going, beyond, the, big, bang, is, the, theory, of, cosmic, inflation, developed, by, alan, guth, and, others, in, the, 1980s, inflation, postulates, a, period, of, extremely, rapid, accelerated, expansion, of, the, universe, prior, to, the, expansion, described, by, the, standard, big, bang, theory, the, theory, of, cosmic, inflation, preserves, the, successes, of, the, big, bang, while, providing, a, natural, explanation, for, some, of, the, mysterious, features, of, the, universe, the, theory, has, also, received, striking, support, from, observations, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, the, radiation, that, has, filled, the, sky, since, around, 380, 000, years, after, the, big, bang, in, the, theory, of, inflation, the, rapid, initial, expansion, of, the, universe, is, caused, by, a, hypothetical, particle, called, the, inflaton, the, exact, properties, of, this, particle, are, not, fixed, by, the, theory, but, should, ultimately, be, derived, from, a, more, fundamental, theory, such, as, string, theory, indeed, there, have, been, a, number, of, attempts, to, identify, an, inflaton, within, the, spectrum, of, particles, described, by, string, theory, and, to, study, inflation, using, string, theory, while, these, approaches, might, eventually, find, support, in, observational, data, such, as, measurements, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, the, application, of, string, theory, to, cosmology, is, still, in, its, early, stages, in, addition, to, influencing, research, in, theoretical, physics, string, theory, has, stimulated, a, number, of, major, developments, in, pure, mathematics, like, many, developing, ideas, in, theoretical, physics, string, theory, does, not, at, present, have, a, mathematically, rigorous, formulation, in, which, all, of, its, concepts, can, be, defined, precisely, as, a, result, physicists, who, study, string, theory, are, often, guided, by, physical, intuition, to, conjecture, relationships, between, the, seemingly, different, mathematical, structures, that, are, used, to, formalize, different, parts, of, the, theory, these, conjectures, are, later, proved, by, mathematicians, and, in, this, way, string, theory, serves, as, a, source, of, new, ideas, in, pure, mathematics, after, calabi, yau, manifolds, had, entered, physics, as, a, way, to, compactify, extra, dimensions, in, string, theory, many, physicists, began, studying, these, manifolds, in, the, late, 1980s, several, physicists, noticed, that, given, such, a, compactification, of, string, theory, it, is, not, possible, to, reconstruct, uniquely, a, corresponding, calabi, yau, manifold, instead, two, different, versions, of, string, theory, type, iia, and, type, iib, can, be, compactified, on, completely, different, calabi, yau, manifolds, giving, rise, to, the, same, physics, in, this, situation, the, manifolds, are, called, mirror, manifolds, and, the, relationship, between, the, two, physical, theories, is, called, mirror, symmetry, regardless, of, whether, calabi, yau, compactifications, of, string, theory, provide, a, correct, description, of, nature, the, existence, of, the, mirror, duality, between, different, string, theories, has, significant, mathematical, consequences, the, calabi, yau, manifolds, used, in, string, theory, are, of, interest, in, pure, mathematics, and, mirror, symmetry, allows, mathematicians, to, solve, problems, in, enumerative, geometry, a, branch, of, mathematics, concerned, with, counting, the, numbers, of, solutions, to, geometric, questions, enumerative, geometry, studies, a, class, of, geometric, objects, called, algebraic, varieties, which, are, defined, by, the, vanishing, of, polynomials, for, example, the, clebsch, cubic, illustrated, on, the, right, is, an, algebraic, variety, defined, using, a, certain, polynomial, of, degree, three, in, four, variables, a, celebrated, result, of, nineteenth, century, mathematicians, arthur, cayley, and, george, salmon, states, that, there, are, exactly, 27, straight, lines, that, lie, entirely, on, such, a, surface, generalizing, this, problem, one, can, ask, how, many, lines, can, be, drawn, on, a, quintic, calabi, yau, manifold, such, as, the, one, illustrated, above, which, is, defined, by, a, polynomial, of, degree, five, this, problem, was, solved, by, the, nineteenth, century, german, mathematician, hermann, schubert, who, found, that, there, are, exactly, 2, 875, such, lines, in, 1986, geometer, sheldon, katz, proved, that, the, number, of, curves, such, as, circles, that, are, defined, by, polynomials, of, degree, two, and, lie, entirely, in, the, quintic, is, 609, 250, by, the, year, 1991, most, of, the, classical, problems, of, enumerative, geometry, had, been, solved, and, interest, in, enumerative, geometry, had, begun, to, diminish, the, field, was, reinvigorated, in, may, 1991, when, physicists, philip, candelas, xenia, de, la, ossa, paul, green, and, linda, parkes, showed, that, mirror, symmetry, could, be, used, to, translate, difficult, mathematical, questions, about, one, calabi, yau, manifold, into, easier, questions, about, its, mirror, in, particular, they, used, mirror, symmetry, to, show, that, a, six, dimensional, calabi, yau, manifold, can, contain, exactly, 317, 206, 375, curves, of, degree, three, in, addition, to, counting, degree, three, curves, candelas, and, his, collaborators, obtained, a, number, of, more, general, results, for, counting, rational, curves, which, went, far, beyond, the, results, obtained, by, mathematicians, originally, these, results, of, candelas, were, justified, on, physical, grounds, however, mathematicians, generally, prefer, rigorous, proofs, that, do, not, require, an, appeal, to, physical, intuition, inspired, by, physicists, work, on, mirror, symmetry, mathematicians, have, therefore, constructed, their, own, arguments, proving, the, enumerative, predictions, of, mirror, symmetry, today, mirror, symmetry, is, an, active, area, of, research, in, mathematics, and, mathematicians, are, working, to, develop, a, more, complete, mathematical, understanding, of, mirror, symmetry, based, on, physicists, intuition, major, approaches, to, mirror, symmetry, include, the, homological, mirror, symmetry, program, of, maxim, kontsevich, and, the, syz, conjecture, of, andrew, strominger, shing, tung, yau, and, eric, zaslow, group, theory, is, the, branch, of, mathematics, that, studies, the, concept, of, symmetry, for, example, one, can, consider, a, geometric, shape, such, as, an, equilateral, triangle, there, are, various, operations, that, one, can, perform, on, this, triangle, without, changing, its, shape, one, can, rotate, it, through, 120, 240, or, 360, or, one, can, reflect, in, any, of, the, lines, labeled, s, 0, s, 1, or, s, 2, in, the, picture, each, of, these, operations, is, called, a, symmetry, and, the, collection, of, these, symmetries, satisfies, certain, technical, properties, making, it, into, what, mathematicians, call, a, group, in, this, particular, example, the, group, is, known, as, the, dihedral, group, of, order, 6, because, it, has, six, elements, a, general, group, may, describe, finitely, many, or, infinitely, many, symmetries, if, there, are, only, finitely, many, symmetries, it, is, called, a, finite, group, mathematicians, often, strive, for, a, classification, or, list, of, all, mathematical, objects, of, a, given, type, it, is, generally, believed, that, finite, groups, are, too, diverse, to, admit, a, useful, classification, a, more, modest, but, still, challenging, problem, is, to, classify, all, finite, simple, groups, these, are, finite, groups, that, may, be, used, as, building, blocks, for, constructing, arbitrary, finite, groups, in, the, same, way, that, prime, numbers, can, be, used, to, construct, arbitrary, whole, numbers, by, taking, products, one, of, the, major, achievements, of, contemporary, group, theory, is, the, classification, of, finite, simple, groups, a, mathematical, theorem, that, provides, a, list, of, all, possible, finite, simple, groups, this, classification, theorem, identifies, several, infinite, families, of, groups, as, well, as, 26, additional, groups, which, do, not, fit, into, any, family, the, latter, groups, are, called, the, sporadic, groups, and, each, one, owes, its, existence, to, a, remarkable, combination, of, circumstances, the, largest, sporadic, group, the, so, called, monster, group, has, over, 10, 53, elements, more, than, a, thousand, times, the, number, of, atoms, in, the, earth, a, seemingly, unrelated, construction, is, the, j, function, of, number, theory, this, object, belongs, to, a, special, class, of, functions, called, modular, functions, whose, graphs, form, a, certain, kind, of, repeating, pattern, although, this, function, appears, in, a, branch, of, mathematics, that, seems, very, different, from, the, theory, of, finite, groups, the, two, subjects, turn, out, to, be, intimately, related, in, the, late, 1970s, mathematicians, john, mckay, and, john, thompson, noticed, that, certain, numbers, arising, in, the, analysis, of, the, monster, group, namely, the, dimensions, of, its, irreducible, representations, are, related, to, numbers, that, appear, in, a, formula, for, the, j, function, namely, the, coefficients, of, its, fourier, series, this, relationship, was, further, developed, by, john, horton, conway, and, simon, norton, who, called, it, monstrous, moonshine, because, it, seemed, so, far, fetched, in, 1992, richard, borcherds, constructed, a, bridge, between, the, theory, of, modular, functions, and, finite, groups, and, in, the, process, explained, the, observations, of, mckay, and, thompson, borcherds, work, used, ideas, from, string, theory, in, an, essential, way, extending, earlier, results, of, igor, frenkel, james, lepowsky, and, arne, meurman, who, had, realized, the, monster, group, as, the, symmetries, of, a, particular, version, of, string, theory, in, 1998, borcherds, was, awarded, the, fields, medal, for, his, work, since, the, 1990s, the, connection, between, string, theory, and, moonshine, has, led, to, further, results, in, mathematics, and, physics, in, 2010, physicists, tohru, eguchi, hirosi, ooguri, and, yuji, tachikawa, discovered, connections, between, a, different, sporadic, group, the, mathieu, group, m, 24, and, a, certain, version, of, string, theory, miranda, cheng, john, duncan, and, jeffrey, a, harvey, proposed, a, generalization, of, this, moonshine, phenomenon, called, umbral, moonshine, and, their, conjecture, was, proved, mathematically, by, duncan, michael, griffin, and, ken, ono, witten, has, also, speculated, that, the, version, of, string, theory, appearing, in, monstrous, moonshine, might, be, related, to, a, certain, simplified, model, of, gravity, in, three, spacetime, dimensions, some, of, the, structures, reintroduced, by, string, theory, arose, for, the, first, time, much, earlier, as, part, of, the, program, of, classical, unification, started, by, albert, einstein, the, first, person, to, add, a, fifth, dimension, to, a, theory, of, gravity, was, gunnar, nordstr, m, in, 1914, who, noted, that, gravity, in, five, dimensions, describes, both, gravity, and, electromagnetism, in, four, nordstr, m, attempted, to, unify, electromagnetism, with, his, theory, of, gravitation, which, was, however, superseded, by, einstein, s, general, relativity, in, 1919, thereafter, german, mathematician, theodor, kaluza, combined, the, fifth, dimension, with, general, relativity, and, only, kaluza, is, usually, credited, with, the, idea, in, 1926, the, swedish, physicist, oskar, klein, gave, a, physical, interpretation, of, the, unobservable, extra, dimension, it, is, wrapped, into, a, small, circle, einstein, introduced, a, non, symmetric, metric, tensor, while, much, later, brans, and, dicke, added, a, scalar, component, to, gravity, these, ideas, would, be, revived, within, string, theory, where, they, are, demanded, by, consistency, conditions, string, theory, was, originally, developed, during, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, as, a, never, completely, successful, theory, of, hadrons, the, subatomic, particles, like, the, proton, and, neutron, that, feel, the, strong, interaction, in, the, 1960s, geoffrey, chew, and, steven, frautschi, discovered, that, the, mesons, make, families, called, regge, trajectories, with, masses, related, to, spins, in, a, way, that, was, later, understood, by, yoichiro, nambu, holger, bech, nielsen, and, leonard, susskind, to, be, the, relationship, expected, from, rotating, strings, chew, advocated, making, a, theory, for, the, interactions, of, these, trajectories, that, did, not, presume, that, they, were, composed, of, any, fundamental, particles, but, would, construct, their, interactions, from, self, consistency, conditions, on, the, s, matrix, the, s, matrix, approach, was, started, by, werner, heisenberg, in, the, 1940s, as, a, way, of, constructing, a, theory, that, did, not, rely, on, the, local, notions, of, space, and, time, which, heisenberg, believed, break, down, at, the, nuclear, scale, while, the, scale, was, off, by, many, orders, of, magnitude, the, approach, he, advocated, was, ideally, suited, for, a, theory, of, quantum, gravity, working, with, experimental, data, r, dolen, d, horn, and, c, schmid, developed, some, sum, rules, for, hadron, exchange, when, a, particle, and, antiparticle, scatter, virtual, particles, can, be, exchanged, in, two, qualitatively, different, ways, in, the, s, channel, the, two, particles, annihilate, to, make, temporary, intermediate, states, that, fall, apart, into, the, final, state, particles, in, the, t, channel, the, particles, exchange, intermediate, states, by, emission, and, absorption, in, field, theory, the, two, contributions, add, together, one, giving, a, continuous, background, contribution, the, other, giving, peaks, at, certain, energies, in, the, data, it, was, clear, that, the, peaks, were, stealing, from, the, background, the, authors, interpreted, this, as, saying, that, the, t, channel, contribution, was, dual, to, the, s, channel, one, meaning, both, described, the, whole, amplitude, and, included, the, other, the, result, was, widely, advertised, by, murray, gell, mann, leading, gabriele, veneziano, to, construct, a, scattering, amplitude, that, had, the, property, of, dolen, horn, schmid, duality, later, renamed, world, sheet, duality, the, amplitude, needed, poles, where, the, particles, appear, on, straight, line, trajectories, and, there, is, a, special, mathematical, function, whose, poles, are, evenly, spaced, on, half, the, real, line, the, gamma, function, which, was, widely, used, in, regge, theory, by, manipulating, combinations, of, gamma, functions, veneziano, was, able, to, find, a, consistent, scattering, amplitude, with, poles, on, straight, lines, with, mostly, positive, residues, which, obeyed, duality, and, had, the, appropriate, regge, scaling, at, high, energy, the, amplitude, could, fit, near, beam, scattering, data, as, well, as, other, regge, type, fits, and, had, a, suggestive, integral, representation, that, could, be, used, for, generalization, over, the, next, years, hundreds, of, physicists, worked, to, complete, the, bootstrap, program, for, this, model, with, many, surprises, veneziano, himself, discovered, that, for, the, scattering, amplitude, to, describe, the, scattering, of, a, particle, that, appears, in, the, theory, an, obvious, self, consistency, condition, the, lightest, particle, must, be, a, tachyon, miguel, virasoro, and, joel, shapiro, found, a, different, amplitude, now, understood, to, be, that, of, closed, strings, while, ziro, koba, and, holger, nielsen, generalized, veneziano, s, integral, representation, to, multiparticle, scattering, veneziano, and, sergio, fubini, introduced, an, operator, formalism, for, computing, the, scattering, amplitudes, that, was, a, forerunner, of, world, sheet, conformal, theory, while, virasoro, understood, how, to, remove, the, poles, with, wrong, sign, residues, using, a, constraint, on, the, states, claud, lovelace, calculated, a, loop, amplitude, and, noted, that, there, is, an, inconsistency, unless, the, dimension, of, the, theory, is, 26, charles, thorn, peter, goddard, and, richard, brower, went, on, to, prove, that, there, are, no, wrong, sign, propagating, states, in, dimensions, less, than, or, equal, to, 26, in, 1969, 70, yoichiro, nambu, holger, bech, nielsen, and, leonard, susskind, recognized, that, the, theory, could, be, given, a, description, in, space, and, time, in, terms, of, strings, the, scattering, amplitudes, were, derived, systematically, from, the, action, principle, by, peter, goddard, jeffrey, goldstone, claudio, rebbi, and, charles, thorn, giving, a, space, time, picture, to, the, vertex, operators, introduced, by, veneziano, and, fubini, and, a, geometrical, interpretation, to, the, virasoro, conditions, in, 1971, pierre, ramond, added, fermions, to, the, model, which, led, him, to, formulate, a, two, dimensional, supersymmetry, to, cancel, the, wrong, sign, states, john, schwarz, and, andr, neveu, added, another, sector, to, the, fermi, theory, a, short, time, later, in, the, fermion, theories, the, critical, dimension, was, 10, stanley, mandelstam, formulated, a, world, sheet, conformal, theory, for, both, the, bose, and, fermi, case, giving, a, two, dimensional, field, theoretic, path, integral, to, generate, the, operator, formalism, michio, kaku, and, keiji, kikkawa, gave, a, different, formulation, of, the, bosonic, string, as, a, string, field, theory, with, infinitely, many, particle, types, and, with, fields, taking, values, not, on, points, but, on, loops, and, curves, in, 1974, tamiaki, yoneya, discovered, that, all, the, known, string, theories, included, a, massless, spin, two, particle, that, obeyed, the, correct, ward, identities, to, be, a, graviton, john, schwarz, and, jo, l, scherk, came, to, the, same, conclusion, and, made, the, bold, leap, to, suggest, that, string, theory, was, a, theory, of, gravity, not, a, theory, of, hadrons, they, reintroduced, kaluza, klein, theory, as, a, way, of, making, sense, of, the, extra, dimensions, at, the, same, time, quantum, chromodynamics, was, recognized, as, the, correct, theory, of, hadrons, shifting, the, attention, of, physicists, and, apparently, leaving, the, bootstrap, program, in, the, dustbin, of, history, string, theory, eventually, made, it, out, of, the, dustbin, but, for, the, following, decade, all, work, on, the, theory, was, completely, ignored, still, the, theory, continued, to, develop, at, a, steady, pace, thanks, to, the, work, of, a, handful, of, devotees, ferdinando, gliozzi, jo, l, scherk, and, david, olive, realized, in, 1977, that, the, original, ramond, and, neveu, schwarz, strings, were, separately, inconsistent, and, needed, to, be, combined, the, resulting, theory, did, not, have, a, tachyon, and, was, proven, to, have, space, time, supersymmetry, by, john, schwarz, and, michael, green, in, 1984, the, same, year, alexander, polyakov, gave, the, theory, a, modern, path, integral, formulation, and, went, on, to, develop, conformal, field, theory, extensively, in, 1979, daniel, friedan, showed, that, the, equations, of, motions, of, string, theory, which, are, generalizations, of, the, einstein, equations, of, general, relativity, emerge, from, the, renormalization, group, equations, for, the, two, dimensional, field, theory, schwarz, and, green, discovered, t, duality, and, constructed, two, superstring, theories, iia, and, iib, related, by, t, duality, and, type, i, theories, with, open, strings, the, consistency, conditions, had, been, so, strong, that, the, entire, theory, was, nearly, uniquely, determined, with, only, a, few, discrete, choices, in, the, early, 1980s, edward, witten, discovered, that, most, theories, of, quantum, gravity, could, not, accommodate, chiral, fermions, like, the, neutrino, this, led, him, in, collaboration, with, luis, lvarez, gaum, to, study, violations, of, the, conservation, laws, in, gravity, theories, with, anomalies, concluding, that, type, i, string, theories, were, inconsistent, green, and, schwarz, discovered, a, contribution, to, the, anomaly, that, witten, and, alvarez, gaum, had, missed, which, restricted, the, gauge, group, of, the, type, i, string, theory, to, be, so, 32, in, coming, to, understand, this, calculation, edward, witten, became, convinced, that, string, theory, was, truly, a, consistent, theory, of, gravity, and, he, became, a, high, profile, advocate, following, witten, s, lead, between, 1984, and, 1986, hundreds, of, physicists, started, to, work, in, this, field, and, this, is, sometimes, called, the, first, superstring, revolution, during, this, period, david, gross, jeffrey, harvey, emil, martinec, and, ryan, rohm, discovered, heterotic, strings, the, gauge, group, of, these, closed, strings, was, two, copies, of, e8, and, either, copy, could, easily, and, naturally, include, the, standard, model, philip, candelas, gary, horowitz, andrew, strominger, and, edward, witten, found, that, the, calabi, yau, manifolds, are, the, compactifications, that, preserve, a, realistic, amount, of, supersymmetry, while, lance, dixon, and, others, worked, out, the, physical, properties, of, orbifolds, distinctive, geometrical, singularities, allowed, in, string, theory, cumrun, vafa, generalized, t, duality, from, circles, to, arbitrary, manifolds, creating, the, mathematical, field, of, mirror, symmetry, daniel, friedan, emil, martinec, and, stephen, shenker, further, developed, the, covariant, quantization, of, the, superstring, using, conformal, field, theory, techniques, david, gross, and, vipul, periwal, discovered, that, string, perturbation, theory, was, divergent, stephen, shenker, showed, it, diverged, much, faster, than, in, field, theory, suggesting, that, new, non, perturbative, objects, were, missing, in, the, 1990s, joseph, polchinski, discovered, that, the, theory, requires, higher, dimensional, objects, called, d, branes, and, identified, these, with, the, black, hole, solutions, of, supergravity, these, were, understood, to, be, the, new, objects, suggested, by, the, perturbative, divergences, and, they, opened, up, a, new, field, with, rich, mathematical, structure, it, quickly, became, clear, that, d, branes, and, other, p, branes, not, just, strings, formed, the, matter, content, of, the, string, theories, and, the, physical, interpretation, of, the, strings, and, branes, was, revealed, they, are, a, type, of, black, hole, leonard, susskind, had, incorporated, the, holographic, principle, of, gerardus, t, hooft, into, string, theory, identifying, the, long, highly, excited, string, states, with, ordinary, thermal, black, hole, states, as, suggested, by, t, hooft, the, fluctuations, of, the, black, hole, horizon, the, world, sheet, or, world, volume, theory, describes, not, only, the, degrees, of, freedom, of, the, black, hole, but, all, nearby, objects, too, in, 1995, at, the, annual, conference, of, string, theorists, at, the, university, of, southern, california, usc, edward, witten, gave, a, speech, on, string, theory, that, in, essence, united, the, five, string, theories, that, existed, at, the, time, and, giving, birth, to, a, new, 11, dimensional, theory, called, m, theory, m, theory, was, also, foreshadowed, in, the, work, of, paul, townsend, at, approximately, the, same, time, the, flurry, of, activity, that, began, at, this, time, is, sometimes, called, the, second, superstring, revolution, during, this, period, tom, banks, willy, fischler, stephen, shenker, and, leonard, susskind, formulated, matrix, theory, a, full, holographic, description, of, m, theory, using, iia, d0, branes, this, was, the, first, definition, of, string, theory, that, was, fully, non, perturbative, and, a, concrete, mathematical, realization, of, the, holographic, principle, it, is, an, example, of, a, gauge, gravity, duality, and, is, now, understood, to, be, a, special, case, of, the, ads, cft, correspondence, andrew, strominger, and, cumrun, vafa, calculated, the, entropy, of, certain, configurations, of, d, branes, and, found, agreement, with, the, semi, classical, answer, for, extreme, charged, black, holes, petr, ho, ava, and, witten, found, the, eleven, dimensional, formulation, of, the, heterotic, string, theories, showing, that, orbifolds, solve, the, chirality, problem, witten, noted, that, the, effective, description, of, the, physics, of, d, branes, at, low, energies, is, by, a, supersymmetric, gauge, theory, and, found, geometrical, interpretations, of, mathematical, structures, in, gauge, theory, that, he, and, nathan, seiberg, had, earlier, discovered, in, terms, of, the, location, of, the, branes, in, 1997, juan, maldacena, noted, that, the, low, energy, excitations, of, a, theory, near, a, black, hole, consist, of, objects, close, to, the, horizon, which, for, extreme, charged, black, holes, looks, like, an, anti, de, sitter, space, he, noted, that, in, this, limit, the, gauge, theory, describes, the, string, excitations, near, the, branes, so, he, hypothesized, that, string, theory, on, a, near, horizon, extreme, charged, black, hole, geometry, an, anti, de, sitter, space, times, a, sphere, with, flux, is, equally, well, described, by, the, low, energy, limiting, gauge, theory, the, n, 4, supersymmetric, yang, mills, theory, this, hypothesis, which, is, called, the, ads, cft, correspondence, was, further, developed, by, steven, gubser, igor, klebanov, and, alexander, polyakov, and, by, edward, witten, and, it, is, now, well, accepted, it, is, a, concrete, realization, of, the, holographic, principle, which, has, far, reaching, implications, for, black, holes, locality, and, information, in, physics, as, well, as, the, nature, of, the, gravitational, interaction, through, this, relationship, string, theory, has, been, shown, to, be, related, to, gauge, theories, like, quantum, chromodynamics, and, this, has, led, to, a, more, quantitative, understanding, of, the, behavior, of, hadrons, bringing, string, theory, back, to, its, roots, to, construct, models, of, particle, physics, based, on, string, theory, physicists, typically, begin, by, specifying, a, shape, for, the, extra, dimensions, of, spacetime, each, of, these, different, shapes, corresponds, to, a, different, possible, universe, or, vacuum, state, with, a, different, collection, of, particles, and, forces, string, theory, as, it, is, currently, understood, has, an, enormous, number, of, vacuum, states, typically, estimated, to, be, around, 10, 500, and, these, might, be, sufficiently, diverse, to, accommodate, almost, any, phenomenon, that, might, be, observed, at, low, energies, many, critics, of, string, theory, have, expressed, concerns, about, the, large, number, of, possible, universes, described, by, string, theory, in, his, book, not, even, wrong, peter, woit, a, lecturer, in, the, mathematics, department, at, columbia, university, has, argued, that, the, large, number, of, different, physical, scenarios, renders, string, theory, vacuous, as, a, framework, for, constructing, models, of, particle, physics, according, to, woit, the, possible, existence, of, say, 10, 500, consistent, different, vacuum, states, for, superstring, theory, probably, destroys, the, hope, of, using, the, theory, to, predict, anything, if, one, picks, among, this, large, set, just, those, states, whose, properties, agree, with, present, experimental, observations, it, is, likely, there, still, will, be, such, a, large, number, of, these, that, one, can, get, just, about, whatever, value, one, wants, for, the, results, of, any, new, observation, some, physicists, believe, this, large, number, of, solutions, is, actually, a, virtue, because, it, may, allow, a, natural, anthropic, explanation, of, the, observed, values, of, physical, constants, in, particular, the, small, value, of, the, cosmological, constant, the, anthropic, principle, is, the, idea, that, some, of, the, numbers, appearing, in, the, laws, of, physics, are, not, fixed, by, any, fundamental, principle, but, must, be, compatible, with, the, evolution, of, intelligent, life, in, 1987, steven, weinberg, published, an, article, in, which, he, argued, that, the, cosmological, constant, could, not, have, been, too, large, or, else, galaxies, and, intelligent, life, would, not, have, been, able, to, develop, weinberg, suggested, that, there, might, be, a, huge, number, of, possible, consistent, universes, each, with, a, different, value, of, the, cosmological, constant, and, observations, indicate, a, small, value, of, the, cosmological, constant, only, because, humans, happen, to, live, in, a, universe, that, has, allowed, intelligent, life, and, hence, observers, to, exist, string, theorist, leonard, susskind, has, argued, that, string, theory, provides, a, natural, anthropic, explanation, of, the, small, value, of, the, cosmological, constant, according, to, susskind, the, different, vacuum, states, of, string, theory, might, be, realized, as, different, universes, within, a, larger, multiverse, the, fact, that, the, observed, universe, has, a, small, cosmological, constant, is, just, a, tautological, consequence, of, the, fact, that, a, small, value, is, required, for, life, to, exist, many, prominent, theorists, and, critics, have, disagreed, with, susskind, s, conclusions, according, to, woit, in, this, case, is, nothing, more, than, an, excuse, for, failure, speculative, scientific, ideas, fail, not, just, when, they, make, incorrect, predictions, but, also, when, they, turn, out, to, be, vacuous, and, incapable, of, predicting, anything, it, remains, unknown, whether, string, theory, is, compatible, with, a, metastable, positive, cosmological, constant, some, putative, examples, of, such, solutions, do, exist, such, as, the, model, described, by, kachru, et, al, in, 2003, in, 2018, a, group, of, four, physicists, advanced, a, controversial, conjecture, which, would, imply, that, no, such, universe, exists, this, is, contrary, to, some, popular, models, of, dark, energy, such, as, cdm, which, requires, a, positive, vacuum, energy, however, string, theory, is, likely, compatible, with, certain, types, of, quintessence, where, dark, energy, is, caused, by, a, new, field, with, exotic, properties, one, of, the, fundamental, properties, of, einstein, s, general, theory, of, relativity, is, that, it, is, background, independent, meaning, that, the, formulation, of, the, theory, does, not, in, any, way, privilege, a, particular, spacetime, geometry, one, of, the, main, criticisms, of, string, theory, from, early, on, is, that, it, is, not, manifestly, background, independent, in, string, theory, one, must, typically, specify, a, fixed, reference, geometry, for, spacetime, and, all, other, possible, geometries, are, described, as, perturbations, of, this, fixed, one, in, his, book, the, trouble, with, physics, physicist, lee, smolin, of, the, perimeter, institute, for, theoretical, physics, claims, that, this, is, the, principal, weakness, of, string, theory, as, a, theory, of, quantum, gravity, saying, that, string, theory, has, failed, to, incorporate, this, important, insight, from, general, relativity, others, have, disagreed, with, smolin, s, characterization, of, string, theory, in, a, review, of, smolin, s, book, string, theorist, joseph, polchinski, writes, is, mistaking, an, aspect, of, the, mathematical, language, being, used, for, one, of, the, physics, being, described, new, physical, theories, are, often, discovered, using, a, mathematical, language, that, is, not, the, most, suitable, for, them, in, string, theory, it, has, always, been, clear, that, the, physics, is, background, independent, even, if, the, language, being, used, is, not, and, the, search, for, a, more, suitable, language, continues, indeed, as, smolin, belatedly, notes, provides, a, solution, to, this, problem, one, that, is, unexpected, and, powerful, polchinski, notes, that, an, important, open, problem, in, quantum, gravity, is, to, develop, holographic, descriptions, of, gravity, which, do, not, require, the, gravitational, field, to, be, asymptotically, anti, de, sitter, smolin, has, responded, by, saying, that, the, ads, cft, correspondence, as, it, is, currently, understood, may, not, be, strong, enough, to, resolve, all, concerns, about, background, independence, since, the, superstring, revolutions, of, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, string, theory, has, been, one, of, the, dominant, paradigms, of, high, energy, theoretical, physics, some, string, theorists, have, expressed, the, view, that, there, does, not, exist, an, equally, successful, alternative, theory, addressing, the, deep, questions, of, fundamental, physics, in, an, interview, from, 1987, nobel, laureate, david, gross, made, the, following, controversial, comments, about, the, reasons, for, the, popularity, of, string, theory, the, most, important, is, that, there, are, no, other, good, ideas, around, that, s, what, gets, most, people, into, it, when, people, started, to, get, interested, in, string, theory, they, didn, t, know, anything, about, it, in, fact, the, first, reaction, of, most, people, is, that, the, theory, is, extremely, ugly, and, unpleasant, at, least, that, was, the, case, a, few, years, ago, when, the, understanding, of, string, theory, was, much, less, developed, it, was, difficult, for, people, to, learn, about, it, and, to, be, turned, on, so, i, think, the, real, reason, why, people, have, got, attracted, by, it, is, because, there, is, no, other, game, in, town, all, other, approaches, of, constructing, grand, unified, theories, which, were, more, conservative, to, begin, with, and, only, gradually, became, more, and, more, radical, have, failed, and, this, game, hasn, t, failed, yet, several, other, high, profile, theorists, and, commentators, have, expressed, similar, views, suggesting, that, there, are, no, viable, alternatives, to, string, theory, many, critics, of, string, theory, have, commented, on, this, state, of, affairs, in, his, book, criticizing, string, theory, peter, woit, views, the, status, of, string, theory, research, as, unhealthy, and, detrimental, to, the, future, of, fundamental, physics, he, argues, that, the, extreme, popularity, of, string, theory, among, theoretical, physicists, is, partly, a, consequence, of, the, financial, structure, of, academia, and, the, fierce, competition, for, scarce, resources, in, his, book, the, road, to, reality, mathematical, physicist, roger, penrose, expresses, similar, views, stating, the, often, frantic, competitiveness, that, this, ease, of, communication, engenders, leads, to, bandwagon, effects, where, researchers, fear, to, be, left, behind, if, they, do, not, join, in, penrose, also, claims, that, the, technical, difficulty, of, modern, physics, forces, young, scientists, to, rely, on, the, preferences, of, established, researchers, rather, than, forging, new, paths, of, their, own, lee, smolin, expresses, a, slightly, different, position, in, his, critique, claiming, that, string, theory, grew, out, of, a, tradition, of, particle, physics, which, discourages, speculation, about, the, foundations, of, physics, while, his, preferred, approach, loop, quantum, gravity, encourages, more, radical, thinking, according, to, smolin, string, theory, is, a, powerful, well, motivated, idea, and, deserves, much, of, the, work, that, has, been, devoted, to, it, if, it, has, so, far, failed, the, principal, reason, is, that, its, intrinsic, flaws, are, closely, tied, to, its, strengths, and, of, course, the, story, is, unfinished, since, string, theory, may, well, turn, out, to, be, part, of, the, truth, the, real, question, is, not, why, we, have, expended, so, much, energy, on, string, theory, but, why, we, haven, t, expended, nearly, enough, on, alternative, approaches, smolin, goes, on, to, offer, a, number, of, prescriptions, for, how, scientists, might, encourage, a, greater, diversity, of, approaches, to, quantum, gravity, research
