vanadium, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, v, and, atomic, number, 23, it, is, a, hard, silvery, grey, malleable, transition, metal, the, elemental, metal, is, rarely, found, in, nature, but, once, isolated, artificially, the, formation, of, an, oxide, layer, passivation, somewhat, stabilizes, the, free, metal, against, further, oxidation, spanish, mexican, scientist, andr, s, manuel, del, r, o, discovered, compounds, of, vanadium, in, 1801, by, analyzing, a, new, lead, bearing, mineral, he, called, brown, lead, though, he, initially, presumed, its, qualities, were, due, to, the, presence, of, a, new, element, he, was, later, erroneously, convinced, by, french, chemist, hippolyte, victor, collet, descotils, that, the, element, was, just, chromium, then, in, 1830, nils, gabriel, sefstr, m, generated, chlorides, of, vanadium, thus, proving, there, was, a, new, element, and, named, it, vanadium, after, the, scandinavian, goddess, of, beauty, and, fertility, vanad, s, freyja, the, name, was, based, on, the, wide, range, of, colors, found, in, vanadium, compounds, del, r, o, s, lead, mineral, was, ultimately, named, vanadinite, for, its, vanadium, content, in, 1867, henry, enfield, roscoe, obtained, the, pure, element, vanadium, occurs, naturally, in, about, 65, minerals, and, fossil, fuel, deposits, it, is, produced, in, china, and, russia, from, steel, smelter, slag, other, countries, produce, it, either, from, magnetite, directly, flue, dust, of, heavy, oil, or, as, a, byproduct, of, uranium, mining, it, is, mainly, used, to, produce, specialty, steel, alloys, such, as, high, speed, tool, steels, and, some, aluminium, alloys, the, most, important, industrial, vanadium, compound, vanadium, pentoxide, is, used, as, a, catalyst, for, the, production, of, sulfuric, acid, the, vanadium, redox, battery, for, energy, storage, may, be, an, important, application, in, the, future, large, amounts, of, vanadium, ions, are, found, in, a, few, organisms, possibly, as, a, toxin, the, oxide, and, some, other, salts, of, vanadium, have, moderate, toxicity, particularly, in, the, ocean, vanadium, is, used, by, some, life, forms, as, an, active, center, of, enzymes, such, as, the, vanadium, bromoperoxidase, of, some, ocean, algae, vanadium, was, discovered, in, mexico, in, 1801, by, the, spanish, mineralogist, andr, s, manuel, del, r, o, del, r, o, extracted, the, element, from, a, sample, of, mexican, brown, lead, ore, later, named, vanadinite, he, found, that, its, salts, exhibit, a, wide, variety, of, colors, and, as, a, result, he, named, the, element, panchromium, greek, all, colors, later, del, r, o, renamed, the, element, erythronium, greek, red, because, most, of, the, salts, turned, red, upon, heating, in, 1805, french, chemist, hippolyte, victor, collet, descotils, backed, by, del, r, o, s, friend, baron, alexander, von, humboldt, incorrectly, declared, that, del, r, o, s, new, element, was, an, impure, sample, of, chromium, del, r, o, accepted, collet, descotils, statement, and, retracted, his, claim, in, 1831, swedish, chemist, nils, gabriel, sefstr, m, rediscovered, the, element, in, a, new, oxide, he, found, while, working, with, iron, ores, later, that, year, friedrich, w, hler, confirmed, that, this, element, was, identical, to, that, found, by, del, r, o, and, hence, confirmed, del, r, o, s, earlier, work, sefstr, m, chose, a, name, beginning, with, v, which, had, not, yet, been, assigned, to, any, element, he, called, the, element, vanadium, after, old, norse, vanad, s, another, name, for, the, norse, vanir, goddess, freyja, whose, attributes, include, beauty, and, fertility, because, of, the, many, beautifully, colored, chemical, compounds, it, produces, on, learning, of, w, hler, s, findings, del, r, o, began, to, passionately, argue, that, his, old, claim, be, recognized, but, the, element, kept, the, name, vanadium, in, 1831, the, geologist, george, william, featherstonhaugh, suggested, that, vanadium, should, be, renamed, rionium, after, del, r, o, but, this, suggestion, was, not, followed, as, vanadium, is, usually, found, combined, with, other, elements, the, isolation, of, vanadium, metal, was, difficult, in, 1831, berzelius, reported, the, production, of, the, metal, but, henry, enfield, roscoe, showed, that, berzelius, had, produced, the, nitride, vanadium, nitride, vn, roscoe, eventually, produced, the, metal, in, 1867, by, reduction, of, vanadium, ii, chloride, vcl, 2, with, hydrogen, in, 1927, pure, vanadium, was, produced, by, reducing, vanadium, pentoxide, with, calcium, the, first, large, scale, industrial, use, of, vanadium, was, in, the, steel, alloy, chassis, of, the, ford, model, t, inspired, by, french, race, cars, vanadium, steel, allowed, reduced, weight, while, increasing, tensile, strength, c, 1905, for, the, first, decade, of, the, 20th, century, most, vanadium, ore, were, mined, by, the, american, vanadium, company, from, the, minas, ragra, in, peru, later, the, demand, for, uranium, rose, leading, to, increased, mining, of, that, metal, s, ores, one, major, uranium, ore, was, carnotite, which, also, contains, vanadium, thus, vanadium, became, available, as, a, by, product, of, uranium, production, eventually, uranium, mining, began, to, supply, a, large, share, of, the, demand, for, vanadium, in, 1911, german, chemist, martin, henze, discovered, vanadium, in, the, hemovanadin, proteins, found, in, blood, cells, or, coelomic, cells, of, ascidiacea, sea, squirts, vanadium, is, an, average, hard, ductile, steel, blue, metal, vanadium, is, usually, described, as, soft, because, it, is, ductile, malleable, and, not, brittle, vanadium, is, harder, than, most, metals, and, steels, see, hardnesses, of, the, elements, data, page, and, iron, it, has, good, resistance, to, corrosion, and, it, is, stable, against, alkalis, and, sulfuric, and, hydrochloric, acids, it, is, oxidized, in, air, at, about, 933, k, 660, c, 1220, f, although, an, oxide, passivation, layer, forms, even, at, room, temperature, it, also, reacts, with, hydrogen, peroxide, naturally, occurring, vanadium, is, composed, of, one, stable, isotope, 51, v, and, one, radioactive, isotope, 50, v, the, latter, has, a, half, life, of, 2, 71, 10, 17, years, and, a, natural, abundance, of, 0, 25, 51, v, has, a, nuclear, spin, of, 7, 2, which, is, useful, for, nmr, spectroscopy, twenty, four, artificial, radioisotopes, have, been, characterized, ranging, in, mass, number, from, 40, to, 65, the, most, stable, of, these, isotopes, are, 49, v, with, a, half, life, of, 330, days, and, 48, v, with, a, half, life, of, 16, 0, days, the, remaining, radioactive, isotopes, have, half, lives, shorter, than, an, hour, most, below, 10, seconds, at, least, four, isotopes, have, metastable, excited, states, electron, capture, is, the, main, decay, mode, for, isotopes, lighter, than, 51, v, for, the, heavier, ones, the, most, common, mode, is, beta, decay, the, electron, capture, reactions, lead, to, the, formation, of, element, 22, titanium, isotopes, while, beta, decay, leads, to, element, 24, chromium, isotopes, the, chemistry, of, vanadium, is, noteworthy, for, the, accessibility, of, the, four, adjacent, oxidation, states, 2, 5, in, an, aqueous, solution, vanadium, forms, metal, aquo, complexes, of, which, the, colors, are, lilac, 2, green, 3, blue, 2, yellow, orange, oxides, 3, the, formula, for, which, depends, on, ph, vanadium, ii, compounds, are, reducing, agents, and, vanadium, v, compounds, are, oxidizing, agents,

obtain, the, different, colors, of, vanadium, in, these, four, oxidation, states, lower, oxidation, states, occur, in, compounds, such, as, v, co, 6, and, substituted, derivatives, vanadium, pentoxide, is, a, commercially, important, catalyst, for, the, production, of, sulfuric, acid, a, reaction, that, exploits, the, ability, of, vanadium, oxides, to, undergo, redox, reactions, the, vanadium, redox, battery, utilizes, all, four, oxidation, states, one, electrode, uses, the, 5, 4, couple, and, the, other, uses, the, 3, 2, couple, conversion, of, these, oxidation, states, is, illustrated, by, the, reduction, of, a, strongly, acidic, solution, of, a, vanadium, v, compound, with, zinc, dust, or, amalgam, the, initial, yellow, color, characteristic, of, the, pervanadyl, ion, is, replaced, by, the, blue, color, of, 2, followed, by, the, green, color, of, 3, and, then, the, violet, color, of, 2, another, potential, vanadium, battery, based, on, vb, 2, uses, multiple, oxidation, state, to, allow, for, 11, electrons, to, be, released, per, vb, 2, giving, it, higher, energy, capacity, by, order, of, compared, to, li, ion, and, gasoline, per, unit, volume, vb, 2, batteries, can, be, further, enhanced, as, air, batteries, allowing, for, even, higher, energy, density, and, lower, weight, than, lithium, battery, or, gasoline, even, though, recharging, remains, a, challenge, in, an, aqueous, solution, vanadium, v, forms, an, extensive, family, of, oxyanions, as, established, by, 51, v, nmr, spectroscopy, the, interrelationships, in, this, family, are,

gives, the, nitrogenase, slightly, different, properties, vanadium, is, essential, to, tunicates, where, it, is, stored, in, the, highly, acidified, vacuoles, of, certain, blood, cell, types, designated, vanadocytes, vanabins, vanadium, binding, proteins, have, been, identified, in, the, cytoplasm, of, such, cells, the, concentration, of, vanadium, in, the, blood, of, ascidian, tunicates, is, as, much, as, ten, million, times, higher, than, the, surrounding, seawater, which, normally, contains, 1, to, 2, g, l, the, function, of, this, vanadium, concentration, system, and, these, vanadium, bearing, proteins, is, still, unknown, but, the, vanadocytes, are, later, deposited, just, under, the, outer, surface, of, the, tunic, where, they, may, deter, predation, amanita, muscaria, and, related, species, of, macrofungi, accumulate, vanadium, up, to, 500, mg, kg, in, dry, weight, vanadium, is, present, in, the, coordination, complex, amavadin, in, fungal, fruit, bodies, the, biological, importance, of, the, accumulation, is, unknown, toxic, or, peroxidase, enzyme, functions, have, been, suggested, deficiencies, in, vanadium, result, in, reduced, growth, in, rats, the, u, s, institute, of, medicine, has, not, confirmed, that, vanadium, is, an, essential, nutrient, for, humans, so, neither, a, recommended, dietary, intake, nor, an, adequate, intake, have, been, established, dietary, intake, is, estimated, at, 6, to, 18, g, day, with, less, than, 5, absorbed, the, tolerable, upper, intake, level, ul, of, dietary, vanadium, beyond, which, adverse, effects, may, occur, is, set, at, 1, 8, mg, day, vanadyl, sulfate, as, a, dietary, supplement, has, been, researched, as, a, means, of, increasing, insulin, sensitivity, or, otherwise, improving, glycemic, control, in, people, who, are, diabetic, some, of, the, trials, had, significant, treatment, effects, but, were, deemed, as, being, of, poor, study, quality, the, amounts, of, vanadium, used, in, these, trials, 30, to, 150, mg, far, exceeded, the, safe, upper, limit, the, conclusion, of, the, systemic, review, was, there, is, no, rigorous, evidence, that, oral, vanadium, supplementation, improves, glycaemic, control, in, type, 2, diabetes, the, routine, use, of, vanadium, for, this, purpose, cannot, be, recommended, in, astrobiology, it, has, been, suggested, that, discrete, vanadium, accumulations, on, mars, could, be, a, potential, microbial, biosignature, when, used, in, conjunction, with, raman, spectroscopy, and, morphology, all, vanadium, compounds, should, be, considered, toxic, tetravalent, voso, 4, has, been, reported, to, be, at, least, 5, times, more, toxic, than, trivalent, v, 2, o, 3, the, us, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, has, set, an, exposure, limit, of, 0, 05, mg, m, 3, for, vanadium, pentoxide, dust, and, 0, 1, mg, m, 3, for, vanadium, pentoxide, fumes, in, workplace, air, for, an, 8, hour, workday, 40, hour, work, week, the, us, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, has, recommended, that, 35, mg, m, 3, of, vanadium, be, considered, immediately, dangerous, to, life, and, health, that, is, likely, to, cause, permanent, health, problems, or, death, vanadium, compounds, are, poorly, absorbed, through, the, gastrointestinal, system, inhalation, of, vanadium, and, vanadium, compounds, results, primarily, in, adverse, effects, on, the, respiratory, system, quantitative, data, are, however, insufficient, to, derive, a, subchronic, or, chronic, inhalation, reference, dose, other, effects, have, been, reported, after, oral, or, inhalation, exposures, on, blood, parameters, liver, neurological, development, and, other, organs, in, rats, there, is, little, evidence, that, vanadium, or, vanadium, compounds, are, reproductive, toxins, or, teratogens, vanadium, pentoxide, was, reported, to, be, carcinogenic, in, male, rats, and, in, male, and, female, mice, by, inhalation, in, an, ntp, study, although, the, interpretation, of, the, results, has, been, disputed, a, few, years, after, the, report, the, carcinogenicity, of, vanadium, has, not, been, determined, by, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, vanadium, traces, in, diesel, fuels, are, the, main, fuel, component, in, high, temperature, corrosion, during, combustion, vanadium, oxidizes, and, reacts, with, sodium, and, sulfur, yielding, vanadate, compounds, with, melting, points, as, low, as, 530, c, 986, f, which, attack, the, passivation, layer, on, steel, and, render, it, susceptible, to, corrosion, the, solid, vanadium, compounds, also, abrade, engine, components
