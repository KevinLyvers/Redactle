accuracy, and, precision, are, two, measures, of, observational, error, in, the, language, of, statistics, in, the, context, of, observations, made, on, a, ratio, or, interval, scale, a, statistical, sample, can, be, said, to, be, accurate, if, its, average, is, close, to, the, true, value, of, the, quantity, being, measured, and, precise, if, its, standard, deviation, is, small, see, terminological, disambiguation, below, for, i, other, words, that, refer, to, the, same, concepts, and, ii, the, use, of, the, words, accuracy, and, precision, to, refer, to, related, but, different, concepts, in, the, fields, of, science, and, engineering, the, accuracy, of, a, measurement, system, is, the, degree, of, closeness, of, measurements, of, a, quantity, to, that, quantity, s, true, value, the, precision, of, a, measurement, system, related, to, reproducibility, and, repeatability, is, the, degree, to, which, repeated, measurements, under, unchanged, conditions, show, the, same, results, although, the, two, words, precision, and, accuracy, can, be, synonymous, in, colloquial, use, they, are, deliberately, contrasted, in, the, context, of, the, scientific, method, the, field, of, statistics, where, the, interpretation, of, measurements, plays, a, central, role, prefers, to, use, the, terms, bias, and, variability, instead, of, accuracy, and, precision, bias, is, the, amount, of, inaccuracy, and, variability, is, the, amount, of, imprecision, a, measurement, system, can, be, accurate, but, not, precise, precise, but, not, accurate, neither, or, both, for, example, if, an, experiment, contains, a, systematic, error, then, increasing, the, sample, size, generally, increases, precision, but, does, not, improve, accuracy, the, result, would, be, a, consistent, yet, inaccurate, string, of, results, from, the, flawed, experiment, eliminating, the, systematic, error, improves, accuracy, but, does, not, change, precision, a, measurement, system, is, considered, valid, if, it, is, both, accurate, and, precise, related, terms, include, bias, non, random, or, directed, effects, caused, by, a, factor, or, factors, unrelated, to, the, independent, variable, and, error, random, variability, the, terminology, is, also, applied, to, indirect, measurements, that, is, values, obtained, by, a, computational, procedure, from, observed, data, in, addition, to, accuracy, and, precision, measurements, may, also, have, a, measurement, resolution, which, is, the, smallest, change, in, the, underlying, physical, quantity, that, produces, a, response, in, the, measurement, in, numerical, analysis, accuracy, is, also, the, nearness, of, a, calculation, to, the, true, value, while, precision, is, the, resolution, of, the, representation, typically, defined, by, the, number, of, decimal, or, binary, digits, in, military, terms, accuracy, refers, primarily, to, the, accuracy, of, fire, justesse, de, tir, the, precision, of, fire, expressed, by, the, closeness, of, a, grouping, of, shots, at, and, around, the, centre, of, the, target, in, industrial, instrumentation, accuracy, is, the, measurement, tolerance, or, transmission, of, the, instrument, and, defines, the, limits, of, the, errors, made, when, the, instrument, is, used, in, normal, operating, conditions, ideally, a, measurement, device, is, both, accurate, and, precise, with, measurements, all, close, to, and, tightly, clustered, around, the, true, value, the, accuracy, and, precision, of, a, measurement, process, is, usually, established, by, repeatedly, measuring, some, traceable, reference, standard, such, standards, are, defined, in, the, international, system, of, units, abbreviated, si, from, french, syst, me, international, d, unit, s, and, maintained, by, national, standards, organizations, such, as, the, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, in, the, united, states, this, also, applies, when, measurements, are, repeated, and, averaged, in, that, case, the, term, standard, error, is, properly, applied, the, precision, of, the, average, is, equal, to, the, known, standard, deviation, of, the, process, divided, by, the, square, root, of, the, number, of, measurements, averaged, further, the, central, limit, theorem, shows, that, the, probability, distribution, of, the, averaged, measurements, will, be, closer, to, a, normal, distribution, than, that, of, individual, measurements, with, regard, to, accuracy, we, can, distinguish, a, common, convention, in, science, and, engineering, is, to, express, accuracy, and, or, precision, implicitly, by, means, of, significant, figures, where, not, explicitly, stated, the, margin, of, error, is, understood, to, be, one, half, the, value, of, the, last, significant, place, for, instance, a, recording, of, 843, 6, m, or, 843, 0, m, or, 800, 0, m, would, imply, a, margin, of, 0, 05, m, the, last, significant, place, is, the, tenths, place, while, a, recording, of, 843, m, would, imply, a, margin, of, error, of, 0, 5, m, the, last, significant, digits, are, the, units, a, reading, of, 8, 000, m, with, trailing, zeros, and, no, decimal, point, is, ambiguous, the, trailing, zeros, may, or, may, not, be, intended, as, significant, figures, to, avoid, this, ambiguity, the, number, could, be, represented, in, scientific, notation, 8, 0, 10, 3, m, indicates, that, the, first, zero, is, significant, hence, a, margin, of, 50, m, while, 8, 000, 10, 3, m, indicates, that, all, three, zeros, are, significant, giving, a, margin, of, 0, 5, m, similarly, one, can, use, a, multiple, of, the, basic, measurement, unit, 8, 0, km, is, equivalent, to, 8, 0, 10, 3, m, it, indicates, a, margin, of, 0, 05, km, 50, m, however, reliance, on, this, convention, can, lead, to, false, precision, errors, when, accepting, data, from, sources, that, do, not, obey, it, for, example, a, source, reporting, a, number, like, 153, 753, with, precision, 5, 000, looks, like, it, has, precision, 0, 5, under, the, convention, it, would, have, been, rounded, to, 150, 000, alternatively, in, a, scientific, context, if, it, is, desired, to, indicate, the, margin, of, error, with, more, precision, one, can, use, a, notation, such, as, 7, 54398, 23, 10, 10, m, meaning, a, range, of, between, 7, 54375, and, 7, 54421, 10, 10, m, precision, includes, in, engineering, precision, is, often, taken, as, three, times, standard, deviation, of, measurements, taken, representing, the, range, that, 99, 73, of, measurements, can, occur, within, for, example, an, ergonomist, measuring, the, human, body, can, be, confident, that, 99, 73, of, their, extracted, measurements, fall, within, 0, 7, cm, if, using, the, gryphon, processing, system, or, 13, cm, if, using, unprocessed, data, a, shift, in, the, meaning, of, these, terms, appeared, with, the, publication, of, the, iso, 5725, series, of, standards, in, 1994, which, is, also, reflected, in, the, 2008, issue, of, the, bipm, international, vocabulary, of, metrology, vim, items, 2, 13, and, 2, 14, according, to, iso, 5725, 1, the, general, term, accuracy, is, used, to, describe, the, closeness, of, a, measurement, to, the, true, value, when, the, term, is, applied, to, sets, of, measurements, of, the, same, measurand, it, involves, a, component, of, random, error, and, a, component, of, systematic, error, in, this, case, trueness, is, the, closeness, of, the, mean, of, a, set, of, measurement, results, to, the, actual, true, value, that, is, the, systematic, error, and, precision, is, the, closeness, of, agreement, among, a, set, of, results, that, is, the, random, error, iso, 5725, 1, and, vim, also, avoid, the, use, of, the, term, bias, previously, specified, in, bs, 5497, 1, because, it, has, different, connotations, outside, the, fields, of, science, and, engineering, as, in, medicine, and, law, concern, for, the, measurement, of, error, is, widespread, across, many, fields, and, many, terms, have, been, used, to, deal, with, the, same, or, related, concepts, the, three, core, concepts, on, this, page, as, named, in, different, places, are, listed, in, the, same, order, in, each, subsection, below, this, wikipedia, page, validity, avoidance, of, observational, error, the, overarching, concern, accuracy, precision, iso, 5725, accuracy, trueness, avoidance, of, systematic, error, previously, avoidance, of, bias, precision, avoidance, of, random, error, statistics, accuracy, bias, variability, psychometrics, measurement, properties, validity, avoidance, of, constant, error, reliability, avoidance, of, variable, error, see, in, classiciation, below, for, the, use, of, the, words, accuracy, and, precision, to, refer, to, related, but, different, concepts, in, classification, observations, made, against, a, nominal, scale, the, concepts, of, accuracy, and, precision, remain, relevant, a, classifier, can, suffer, from, systematic, errors, and, from, a, lack, of, reliability, however, in, binary, classification, the, terms, accuracy, and, precision, are, also, and, primarily, used, with, a, different, meaning, most, commonly, the, words, relate, to, formulae, for, quantifying, the, error, resulting, from, the, reporting, by, a, classifier, of, for, example, false, positives, in, psychometrics, and, psychophysics, the, term, accuracy, is, interchangeably, used, with, validity, and, constant, error, precision, is, a, synonym, for, reliability, and, variable, error, the, validity, of, a, measurement, instrument, or, psychological, test, is, established, through, experiment, or, correlation, with, behavior, reliability, is, established, with, a, variety, of, statistical, techniques, classically, through, an, internal, consistency, test, like, cronbach, s, alpha, to, ensure, sets, of, related, questions, have, related, responses, and, then, comparison, of, those, related, question, between, reference, and, target, population, in, logic, simulation, a, common, mistake, in, evaluation, of, accurate, models, is, to, compare, a, logic, simulation, model, to, a, transistor, circuit, simulation, model, this, is, a, comparison, of, differences, in, precision, not, accuracy, precision, is, measured, with, respect, to, detail, and, accuracy, is, measured, with, respect, to, reality, in, cognitive, systems, accuracy, and, precision, is, used, to, characterize, and, measure, results, of, a, cognitive, process, performed, by, biological, or, artificial, entities, where, a, cognitive, process, is, a, transformation, of, data, information, knowledge, or, wisdom, to, a, higher, valued, form, dikw, pyramid, sometimes, a, cognitive, process, produces, exactly, the, intended, or, desired, output, but, sometimes, produces, output, far, from, the, intended, or, desired, furthermore, repetitions, of, a, cognitive, process, do, not, always, produce, the, same, output, cognitive, accuracy, c, a, is, the, propensity, of, a, cognitive, process, to, produce, the, intended, or, desired, output, cognitive, precision, c, p, is, the, propensity, of, a, cognitive, process, to, produce, the, same, output, to, measure, augmented, cognition, in, human, cog, ensembles, where, one, or, more, humans, work, collaboratively, with, one, or, more, cognitive, systems, cogs, increases, in, cognitive, accuracy, and, cognitive, precision, assist, in, measuring, the, degree, of, cognitive, augmentation
