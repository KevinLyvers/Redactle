the, eagle, nebula, catalogued, as, messier, 16, or, m16, and, as, ngc, 6611, and, also, known, as, the, star, queen, nebula, is, a, young, open, cluster, of, stars, in, the, constellation, serpens, discovered, by, jean, philippe, de, cheseaux, in, 1745, 46, both, the, eagle, and, the, star, queen, refer, to, visual, impressions, of, the, dark, silhouette, near, the, center, of, the, nebula, an, area, made, famous, as, the, pillars, of, creation, imaged, by, the, hubble, space, telescope, the, nebula, contains, several, active, star, forming, gas, and, dust, regions, including, the, aforementioned, pillars, of, creation, the, eagle, nebula, lies, in, the, sagittarius, arm, of, the, milky, way, the, eagle, nebula, is, part, of, a, diffuse, emission, nebula, or, h, ii, region, which, is, catalogued, as, ic, 4703, this, region, of, active, current, star, formation, is, about, 5700, light, years, distant, a, spire, of, gas, that, can, be, seen, coming, off, the, nebula, in, the, northeastern, part, is, approximately, 9, 5, light, years, or, about, 90, trillion, kilometers, long, the, cluster, associated, with, the, nebula, has, approximately, 8100, stars, which, are, mostly, concentrated, in, a, gap, in, the, molecular, cloud, to, the, north, west, of, the, pillars, the, brightest, star, hd, 168076, has, an, apparent, magnitude, of, 8, 24, easily, visible, with, good, binoculars, it, is, actually, a, binary, star, formed, of, an, o3, 5v, star, plus, an, o7, 5v, companion, this, star, has, a, mass, of, roughly, 80, solar, masses, and, a, luminosity, up, to, 1, million, times, that, of, the, sun, the, cluster, s, age, has, been, estimated, to, be, 1, 2, million, years, the, descriptive, names, reflect, impressions, of, the, shape, of, the, central, pillar, rising, from, the, southeast, into, the, central, luminous, area, the, name, star, queen, nebula, was, introduced, by, robert, burnham, jr, reflecting, his, characterization, of, the, central, pillar, as, the, star, queen, shown, in, silhouette, images, produced, by, jeff, hester, and, paul, scowen, using, the, hubble, space, telescope, in, 1995, greatly, improved, scientific, understanding, of, processes, inside, the, nebula, one, of, these, became, famous, as, the, pillars, of, creation, depicting, a, large, region, of, star, formation, its, small, dark, pockets, are, believed, to, be, protostars, bok, globules, the, pillar, structure, resembles, that, of, a, much, larger, instance, in, the, soul, nebula, of, cassiopeia, imaged, with, the, spitzer, space, telescope, in, 2005, equally, characterized, as, pillars, of, star, creation, or, pillars, of, star, formation, these, columns, which, resemble, stalagmites, protruding, from, the, floor, of, a, cavern, are, composed, of, interstellar, hydrogen, gas, and, dust, which, act, as, incubators, for, new, stars, inside, the, columns, and, on, their, surface, astronomers, have, found, knots, or, globules, of, denser, gas, called, eggs, evaporating, gaseous, globules, stars, are, being, formed, inside, some, of, these, x, ray, images, from, the, chandra, observatory, compared, with, hubble, s, pillars, image, have, shown, that, x, ray, sources, from, young, stars, do, not, coincide, with, the, pillars, but, rather, randomly, dot, the, nebula, any, protostars, in, the, pillars, eggs, are, not, yet, hot, enough, to, emit, x, rays, evidence, from, the, spitzer, space, telescope, originally, suggested, that, the, pillars, in, m16, may, be, threatened, by, a, past, supernova, hot, gas, observed, by, spitzer, in, 2007, suggested, they, were, already, likely, being, disturbed, by, a, supernova, that, exploded, 8, 000, to, 9, 000, years, ago, due, to, the, distance, the, main, blast, of, light, would, have, reached, earth, for, a, brief, time, 1, 000, to, 2, 000, years, ago, a, more, slowly, moving, theorized, shock, wave, would, have, taken, a, few, thousand, years, to, move, through, the, nebula, and, would, have, blown, away, the, delicate, pillars, however, in, 2014, the, pillars, were, imaged, a, second, time, by, hubble, in, both, visible, light, and, infrared, light, the, images, being, 20, years, later, provided, a, new, detailed, account, of, the, rate, of, evaporation, occurring, within, the, pillars, no, supernova, is, evidenced, within, them, and, it, is, estimated, in, some, form, they, still, exist, and, will, appear, for, at, least, 100, 000, more, years
