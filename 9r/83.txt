extraterrestrial, life, alien, life, or, colloquially, aliens, is, life, which, does, not, originate, from, earth, no, extraterrestrial, life, has, yet, been, conclusively, detected, such, life, might, range, from, simple, forms, such, as, prokaryotes, to, intelligent, beings, possibly, bringing, forth, civilizations, that, might, be, far, more, advanced, than, humans, the, drake, equation, speculates, about, the, existence, of, sapient, life, elsewhere, in, the, universe, the, science, of, extraterrestrial, life, is, known, as, astrobiology, speculation, about, the, possibility, of, inhabited, worlds, beyond, earth, dates, back, to, antiquity, early, christian, writers, discussed, the, idea, of, a, plurality, of, worlds, as, proposed, by, earlier, thinkers, such, as, democritus, augustine, references, epicurus, s, idea, of, innumerable, worlds, throughout, the, boundless, immensity, of, space, in, the, city, of, god, pre, modern, writers, typically, assumed, extraterrestrial, worlds, are, inhabited, by, living, beings, william, vorilong, in, the, 15th, century, acknowledged, the, possibility, jesus, could, have, visited, extraterrestrial, worlds, to, redeem, their, inhabitants, nicholas, of, cusa, wrote, in, 1440, that, earth, is, a, brilliant, star, like, other, celestial, objects, visible, in, space, which, would, appear, similar, to, the, sun, from, an, exterior, perspective, due, to, a, layer, of, fiery, brightness, in, the, outer, layer, of, the, atmosphere, he, theorised, all, extraterrestrial, bodies, could, be, inhabited, by, men, plants, and, animals, including, the, sun, descartes, wrote, that, there, was, no, means, to, prove, the, stars, were, not, inhabited, by, intelligent, creatures, but, their, existence, was, a, matter, of, speculation, when, considering, the, atmospheric, composition, and, ecosystems, hosted, by, extraterrestrial, bodies, extraterrestrial, life, can, seem, more, speculation, than, reality, due, to, the, harsh, conditions, and, disparate, chemical, composition, of, the, atmospheres, when, compared, to, the, life, abundant, earth, however, there, are, many, extreme, and, chemically, harsh, ecosystems, on, earth, that, do, support, forms, of, life, and, are, often, hypothesized, to, be, the, origin, of, life, on, earth, hydrothermal, vents, acidic, hot, springs, and, volcanic, lakes, are, examples, of, life, forming, under, difficult, circumstances, provide, parallels, to, the, extreme, environments, on, other, planets, and, support, the, possibility, of, extraterrestrial, life, since, the, mid, 20th, century, active, research, has, taken, place, to, look, for, signs, of, extraterrestrial, life, encompassing, searches, for, current, and, historic, extraterrestrial, life, and, a, narrower, search, for, extraterrestrial, intelligent, life, depending, on, the, category, of, search, methods, range, from, analysis, of, telescope, and, specimen, data, to, radios, used, to, detect, and, transmit, communications, the, concept, of, extraterrestrial, life, and, particularly, extraterrestrial, intelligence, has, had, a, major, cultural, impact, especially, extraterrestrials, in, fiction, science, fiction, has, communicated, scientific, ideas, imagined, a, range, of, possibilities, and, influenced, public, interest, in, and, perspectives, on, extraterrestrial, life, one, shared, space, is, the, debate, over, the, wisdom, of, attempting, communication, with, extraterrestrial, intelligence, some, encourage, aggressive, methods, to, try, to, contact, intelligent, extraterrestrial, life, others, citing, the, tendency, of, technologically, advanced, human, societies, to, enslave, or, destroy, less, advanced, societies, argue, it, may, be, dangerous, to, actively, draw, attention, to, earth, if, extraterrestrial, life, exists, it, could, range, from, simple, microorganisms, and, multicellular, organisms, similar, to, animals, or, plants, to, complex, alien, intelligences, akin, to, humans, when, scientists, talk, about, extraterrestrial, life, they, consider, all, those, types, although, it, is, possible, that, extraterrestrial, life, may, have, other, configurations, scientists, use, the, hierarchy, of, lifeforms, from, earth, for, simplicity, as, it, is, the, only, one, known, to, exist, according, to, the, big, bang, the, universe, was, initially, too, hot, to, allow, life, 15, million, years, later, it, cooled, to, temperate, levels, but, the, elements, that, make, up, living, things, did, not, exist, yet, the, only, freely, available, elements, at, that, point, were, hydrogen, and, helium, carbon, and, oxygen, and, later, water, would, not, appear, until, 50, million, years, later, created, through, stellar, fusion, at, that, point, the, difficulty, for, life, to, appear, was, not, the, temperature, but, the, scarcity, of, free, heavy, elements, planetary, systems, emerged, and, the, first, organic, compounds, may, have, formed, in, the, protoplanetary, disk, of, dust, grains, that, would, eventually, create, rocky, planets, like, earth, although, earth, was, in, a, molten, state, after, its, birth, and, may, have, burned, any, organics, that, fell, in, it, it, would, have, been, more, receptive, once, it, cooled, down, once, the, right, conditions, on, earth, were, met, life, started, by, a, chemical, process, known, as, abiogenesis, alternatively, life, may, have, formed, less, frequently, then, spread, by, meteoroids, for, example, between, habitable, planets, in, a, process, called, panspermia, there, is, an, area, around, a, star, the, circumstellar, habitable, zone, or, goldilocks, zone, where, water, may, be, at, the, right, temperature, to, exist, in, liquid, form, at, a, planetary, surface, this, area, is, neither, too, close, to, the, star, where, water, would, become, steam, nor, too, far, away, where, water, would, be, frozen, as, a, rock, however, although, useful, as, an, approximation, planetary, habitability, is, complex, and, defined, by, several, factors, being, in, the, habitable, zone, is, not, enough, for, a, planet, to, be, habitable, not, even, to, actually, have, such, liquid, water, venus, is, located, in, the, habitable, zone, of, the, solar, system, but, does, not, have, liquid, water, because, of, the, conditions, of, its, atmosphere, jovian, planets, or, gas, giants, are, not, considered, habitable, even, if, they, orbit, close, enough, to, their, stars, as, hot, jupiters, due, to, crushing, atmospheric, pressures, the, actual, distances, for, the, habitable, zones, vary, according, to, the, type, of, star, and, even, the, solar, activity, of, each, specific, star, influences, the, local, habitability, the, type, of, star, also, defines, the, time, the, habitable, zone, will, exist, as, its, presence, and, limits, will, change, along, with, the, star, s, stellar, evolution, life, on, earth, is, quite, ubiquitous, across, the, planet, and, has, adapted, over, time, to, almost, all, the, available, environments, in, it, even, the, most, hostile, ones, as, a, result, it, is, inferred, that, life, in, other, celestial, bodies, may, be, equally, adaptive, however, the, origin, of, life, is, unrelated, to, its, ease, of, adaptation, and, may, have, stricter, requirements, a, planet, or, moon, may, not, have, any, life, on, it, even, if, it, was, habitable, it, is, unclear, if, life, and, intelligent, life, are, ubiquitous, in, the, cosmos, or, rare, the, hypothesis, of, ubiquitous, extraterrestrial, life, relies, on, three, main, ideas, the, first, one, the, size, of, the, universe, allows, for, plenty, of, planets, to, have, a, similar, habitability, to, earth, and, the, age, of, the, universe, gives, enough, time, for, a, long, process, analog, to, the, history, of, earth, to, happen, there, the, second, is, that, the, chemical, elements, that, make, up, life, such, as, carbon, and, water, are, ubiquitous, in, the, universe, the, third, is, that, the, physical, laws, are, universal, which, means, that, the, forces, that, would, facilitate, or, prevent, the, existence, of, life, would, be, the, same, ones, as, on, earth, according, to, this, argument, made, by, scientists, such, as, carl, sagan, and, stephen, hawking, it, would, be, improbable, for, life, not, to, exist, somewhere, else, other, than, earth, this, argument, is, embodied, in, the, copernican, principle, which, states, that, earth, does, not, occupy, a, unique, position, in, the, universe, and, the, mediocrity, principle, which, states, that, there, is, nothing, special, about, life, on, earth, other, authors, consider, instead, that, life, in, the, cosmos, or, at, least, multicellular, life, may, be, actually, rare, the, rare, earth, hypothesis, maintains, that, life, on, earth, is, possible, because, of, a, series, of, factors, that, range, from, the, location, in, the, galaxy, and, the, configuration, of, the, solar, system, to, local, characteristics, of, the, planet, and, that, it, is, unlikely, that, all, such, requirements, are, simultaneously, met, by, another, planet, the, proponents, of, this, hypothesis, consider, that, very, little, evidence, suggests, the, existence, of, extraterrestrial, life, and, that, at, this, point, it, is, just, a, desired, result, and, not, a, reasonable, scientific, explanation, for, any, gathered, data, in, 1961, astronomer, and, astrophysicist, frank, drake, devised, the, drake, equation, as, a, way, to, stimulate, scientific, dialogue, at, a, meeting, on, the, search, for, extraterrestrial, intelligence, seti, the, drake, equation, is, a, probabilistic, argument, used, to, estimate, the, number, of, active, communicative, extraterrestrial, civilisations, in, the, milky, way, galaxy, the, drake, equation, is, where, and, drake, s, proposed, estimates, are, as, follows, but, numbers, on, the, right, side, of, the, equation, are, agreed, as, speculative, and, open, to, substitution, 10, 000, 5, 0, 5, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 10, 000, displaystyle, 10, 000, 5, cdot, 0, 5, cdot, 2, cdot, 1, cdot, 0, 2, cdot, 1, cdot, 10, 000, the, drake, equation, has, proved, controversial, since, although, it, is, written, as, a, math, equation, none, of, its, values, were, known, at, the, time, although, some, values, may, eventually, be, measured, others, are, based, on, social, sciences, and, are, not, knowable, by, their, very, nature, this, does, not, allow, one, to, make, noteworthy, conclusions, from, the, equation, based, on, observations, from, the, hubble, space, telescope, there, are, nearly, 2, trillion, galaxies, in, the, observable, universe, it, is, estimated, that, at, least, ten, per, cent, of, all, sun, like, stars, have, a, system, of, planets, i, e, there, are, 6, 25, 10, 18, stars, with, planets, orbiting, them, in, the, observable, universe, even, if, it, is, assumed, that, only, one, out, of, a, billion, of, these, stars, has, planets, supporting, life, there, would, be, some, 6, 25, billion, life, supporting, planetary, systems, in, the, observable, universe, a, 2013, study, based, on, results, from, the, kepler, spacecraft, estimated, that, the, milky, way, contains, at, least, as, many, planets, as, it, does, stars, resulting, in, 100, 400, billion, exoplanets, the, apparent, contradiction, between, high, estimates, of, the, probability, of, the, existence, of, extraterrestrial, civilisations, and, the, lack, of, evidence, for, such, civilisations, is, known, as, the, fermi, paradox, dennis, w, sciama, claimed, that, life, s, existence, in, the, universe, depends, on, various, fundamental, constants, zhi, wei, wang, and, samuel, l, braunstein, suggest, that, a, random, universe, capable, of, supporting, life, is, likely, to, be, just, barely, able, to, do, so, giving, a, potential, explanation, to, the, fermi, paradox, the, first, basic, requirement, for, life, is, an, environment, with, non, equilibrium, thermodynamics, which, means, that, the, thermodynamic, equilibrium, must, be, broken, by, a, source, of, energy, the, traditional, sources, of, energy, in, the, cosmos, are, the, stars, such, as, for, life, on, earth, which, depends, on, the, energy, of, the, sun, however, there, are, other, alternative, energy, sources, such, as, volcanos, plate, tectonics, and, hydrothermal, vents, there, are, ecosystems, on, earth, in, deep, areas, of, the, ocean, that, do, not, receive, sunlight, and, take, energy, from, black, smokers, instead, magnetic, fields, and, radioactivity, have, also, been, proposed, as, sources, of, energy, although, they, would, be, less, efficient, ones, life, on, earth, requires, water, in, a, liquid, state, as, a, solvent, in, which, biochemical, reactions, take, place, it, is, highly, unlikely, that, an, abiogenesis, process, can, start, within, a, gaseous, or, solid, medium, the, atom, speeds, either, too, fast, or, too, slow, make, it, difficult, for, specific, ones, to, meet, and, start, chemical, reactions, a, liquid, medium, also, allows, the, transport, of, nutrients, and, substances, required, for, metabolism, sufficient, quantities, of, carbon, and, other, elements, along, with, water, might, enable, the, formation, of, living, organisms, on, terrestrial, planets, with, a, chemical, make, up, and, temperature, range, similar, to, that, of, earth, life, based, on, ammonia, rather, than, water, has, been, suggested, as, an, alternative, though, this, solvent, appears, less, suitable, than, water, it, is, also, conceivable, that, there, are, forms, of, life, whose, solvent, is, a, liquid, hydrocarbon, such, as, methane, ethane, or, propane, another, unknown, aspect, of, potential, extraterrestrial, life, would, be, the, chemical, elements, that, would, compose, it, life, on, earth, is, largely, composed, of, carbon, but, there, could, be, other, hypothetical, types, of, biochemistry, a, replacement, for, carbon, would, need, to, be, able, to, create, complex, molecules, store, information, required, for, evolution, and, be, freely, available, in, the, medium, to, create, dna, rna, or, a, close, analog, such, an, element, should, be, able, to, bind, its, atoms, with, many, others, creating, complex, and, stable, molecules, it, should, be, able, to, create, at, least, three, covalent, bonds, two, for, making, long, strings, and, at, least, a, third, to, add, new, links, and, allow, for, diverse, information, only, nine, elements, meet, this, requirement, boron, nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, three, bonds, carbon, silicon, germanium, and, tin, four, bonds, as, for, abundance, carbon, nitrogen, and, silicon, are, the, most, abundant, ones, in, the, universe, far, more, than, the, others, on, earth, s, crust, the, most, abundant, of, those, elements, is, silicon, in, the, hydrosphere, it, is, carbon, and, in, the, atmosphere, it, is, carbon, and, nitrogen, silicon, however, has, disadvantages, over, carbon, the, molecules, formed, with, silicon, atoms, are, less, stable, and, more, vulnerable, to, acids, oxygen, and, light, an, ecosystem, of, silicon, based, lifeforms, would, require, very, low, temperatures, high, atmospheric, pressure, an, atmosphere, devoid, of, oxygen, and, a, solvent, other, than, water, the, low, temperatures, required, would, add, an, extra, problem, the, difficulty, to, kickstart, a, process, of, abiogenesis, to, create, life, in, the, first, place, norman, horowitz, head, of, the, jet, propulsion, laboratory, bioscience, section, for, the, mariner, and, viking, missions, from, 1965, to, 1976, considered, that, the, great, versatility, of, the, carbon, atom, makes, it, the, element, most, likely, to, provide, solutions, even, exotic, solutions, to, the, problems, of, survival, of, life, on, other, planets, however, he, also, considered, that, the, conditions, found, on, mars, were, incompatible, with, carbon, based, life, even, if, extraterrestrial, life, is, based, on, carbon, and, uses, water, as, a, solvent, like, earth, life, it, may, still, have, a, radically, different, biochemistry, life, is, generally, considered, to, be, a, product, of, natural, selection, it, has, been, proposed, that, to, undergo, natural, selection, a, living, entity, must, have, the, capacity, to, replicate, itself, the, capacity, to, avoid, damage, decay, and, the, capacity, to, acquire, and, process, resources, in, support, of, the, first, two, capacities, life, on, earth, started, with, an, rna, world, and, later, evolved, to, its, current, form, where, some, of, the, rna, tasks, were, transferred, to, dna, and, proteins, extraterrestrial, life, may, still, be, stuck, using, rna, or, evolve, into, other, configurations, it, is, unclear, if, our, biochemistry, is, the, most, efficient, one, that, could, be, generated, or, which, elements, would, follow, a, similar, pattern, however, it, is, likely, that, even, if, cells, had, a, different, composition, to, those, from, earth, they, would, still, have, a, cell, membrane, life, on, earth, jumped, from, prokaryotes, to, eukaryotes, and, from, unicellular, organisms, to, multicellular, organisms, through, evolution, so, far, no, alternative, process, to, achieve, such, a, result, has, been, conceived, even, if, hypothetical, evolution, requires, life, to, be, divided, into, individual, organisms, and, no, alternative, organisation, has, been, satisfactorily, proposed, either, at, the, basic, level, membranes, define, the, limit, of, a, cell, between, it, and, its, environment, while, remaining, partially, open, to, exchange, energy, and, resources, with, it, the, evolution, from, simple, cells, to, eukaryotes, and, from, them, to, multicellular, lifeforms, is, not, guaranteed, the, cambrian, explosion, took, place, thousands, of, millions, of, years, after, the, origin, of, life, and, its, causes, are, not, fully, known, yet, on, the, other, hand, the, jump, to, multicellularity, took, place, several, times, which, suggests, that, it, could, be, a, case, of, convergent, evolution, and, so, likely, to, take, place, on, other, planets, as, well, palaeontologist, simon, conway, morris, considers, that, convergent, evolution, would, lead, to, kingdoms, similar, to, our, plants, and, animals, and, that, many, features, are, likely, to, develop, in, alien, animals, as, well, such, as, bilateral, symmetry, limbs, digestive, systems, and, heads, with, sensory, organs, scientists, from, the, university, of, oxford, analysed, it, from, the, perspective, of, evolutionary, theory, and, wrote, in, a, study, in, the, international, journal, of, astrobiology, that, aliens, may, be, similar, to, humans, the, planetary, context, would, also, have, an, influence, a, planet, with, higher, gravity, would, have, smaller, animals, and, other, types, of, stars, can, lead, to, non, green, photosynthesisers, the, amount, of, energy, available, would, also, affect, biodiversity, as, an, ecosystem, sustained, by, black, smokers, or, hydrothermal, vents, would, have, less, energy, available, than, those, sustained, by, a, star, s, light, and, heat, and, so, its, lifeforms, would, not, grow, beyond, a, certain, complexity, there, is, also, research, in, assessing, the, capacity, of, life, for, developing, intelligence, it, has, been, suggested, that, this, capacity, arises, with, the, number, of, potential, niches, a, planet, contains, and, that, the, complexity, of, life, itself, is, reflected, in, the, information, density, of, planetary, environments, which, in, turn, can, be, computed, from, its, niches, it, is, common, knowledge, that, the, conditions, on, other, planets, in, the, solar, system, in, addition, to, the, many, galaxies, outside, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, are, very, harsh, and, seem, to, be, too, extreme, to, harbor, any, life, the, environmental, conditions, on, these, planets, can, have, intense, uv, radiation, paired, with, extreme, temperatures, lack, of, water, and, much, more, that, can, lead, to, conditions, that, don, t, seem, to, favor, the, creation, or, maintenance, of, extraterrestrial, life, however, there, has, been, much, historical, evidence, that, some, of, the, earliest, and, most, basic, forms, of, life, on, earth, originated, in, some, extreme, environments, that, seem, unlikely, to, have, harbored, life, at, least, at, one, point, in, earth, s, history, fossil, evidence, as, well, as, many, historical, theories, backed, up, by, years, of, research, and, studies, have, marked, environments, like, hydrothermal, vents, or, acidic, hot, springs, as, some, of, the, first, places, that, life, could, have, originated, on, earth, these, environments, can, be, considered, extreme, when, compared, to, the, typical, ecosystems, that, the, majority, of, life, on, earth, now, inhabit, as, hydrothermal, vents, are, scorching, hot, due, to, the, magma, escaping, from, the, earth, s, mantle, and, meeting, the, much, colder, oceanic, water, even, in, today, s, world, there, can, be, a, diverse, population, of, bacteria, found, inhabiting, the, area, surrounding, these, hydrothermal, vents, which, can, suggest, that, some, form, of, life, can, be, supported, even, in, the, harshest, of, environments, like, the, other, planets, in, the, solar, system, the, aspects, of, these, harsh, environments, that, make, them, ideal, for, the, origin, of, life, on, earth, as, well, as, the, possibility, of, creation, of, life, on, other, planets, is, the, chemical, reactions, forming, spontaneously, for, example, the, hydrothermal, vents, found, on, the, ocean, floor, are, known, to, support, many, chemosynthetic, processes, which, allow, organisms, to, utilize, energy, through, reduced, chemical, compounds, that, fix, carbon, in, return, these, reactions, will, allow, for, organisms, to, live, in, relatively, low, oxygenated, environments, while, maintaining, enough, energy, to, support, themselves, the, early, earth, environment, was, reducing, and, therefore, these, carbon, fixing, compounds, were, necessary, for, the, survival, and, possible, origin, of, life, on, earth, with, the, little, amount, of, information, that, scientists, have, found, regarding, the, atmosphere, on, other, planets, in, the, milky, way, galaxy, and, beyond, the, atmospheres, are, most, likely, reducing, or, with, very, low, oxygen, levels, especially, when, compared, with, earth, s, atmosphere, if, there, were, the, necessary, elements, and, ions, on, these, planets, the, same, carbon, fixing, reduced, chemical, compounds, occurring, around, hydrothermal, vents, could, also, occur, on, these, planets, surfaces, and, possibly, result, in, the, origin, of, extraterrestrial, life, the, solar, system, has, a, wide, variety, of, planets, dwarf, planets, and, moons, and, each, one, is, studied, for, its, potential, to, host, life, each, one, has, its, own, specific, conditions, that, may, benefit, or, harm, life, so, far, the, only, lifeforms, found, are, those, from, earth, no, extraterrestrial, intelligence, other, than, humans, exists, or, has, ever, existed, within, the, solar, system, astrobiologist, mary, voytek, points, out, that, it, would, be, unlikely, to, find, large, ecosystems, as, they, would, have, already, been, detected, by, now, the, inner, solar, system, is, likely, devoid, of, life, however, venus, is, still, of, interest, to, astrobiologists, as, it, is, a, terrestrial, planet, that, was, likely, similar, to, earth, in, its, early, stages, and, developed, in, a, different, way, there, is, a, greenhouse, effect, the, surface, is, the, hottest, in, the, solar, system, sulfuric, acid, clouds, all, surface, liquid, water, is, lost, and, it, has, a, thick, carbon, dioxide, atmosphere, with, huge, pressure, comparing, both, helps, to, understand, the, precise, differences, that, lead, to, beneficial, or, harmful, conditions, for, life, and, despite, the, conditions, against, life, on, venus, there, are, suspicions, that, microbial, lifeforms, may, still, survive, in, high, altitude, clouds, mars, is, a, cold, and, almost, airless, desert, inhospitable, to, life, however, recent, studies, revealed, that, water, on, mars, used, to, be, quite, abundant, forming, rivers, lakes, and, perhaps, even, oceans, mars, may, have, been, habitable, back, then, and, life, on, mars, may, have, been, possible, but, when, the, planetary, core, ceased, to, generate, a, magnetic, field, solar, winds, removed, the, atmosphere, and, the, planet, became, vulnerable, to, solar, radiation, ancient, lifeforms, may, still, have, left, fossilised, remains, and, microbes, may, still, survive, deep, underground, as, mentioned, the, gas, giants, and, ice, giants, are, unlikely, to, contain, life, the, most, distant, solar, system, bodies, found, in, the, kuiper, belt, and, outwards, are, locked, in, permanent, deep, freeze, but, cannot, be, ruled, out, completely, although, the, giant, planets, themselves, are, highly, unlikely, to, have, life, there, is, much, hope, to, find, it, on, moons, orbiting, these, planets, europa, from, the, jovian, system, has, a, subsurface, ocean, below, a, thick, layer, of, ice, ganymede, and, callisto, also, have, subsurface, oceans, but, life, is, less, likely, in, them, because, water, is, sandwiched, between, layers, of, solid, ice, europa, would, have, contact, between, the, ocean, and, the, rocky, surface, which, helps, the, chemical, reactions, it, may, be, difficult, to, dig, so, deep, in, order, to, study, those, oceans, though, enceladus, a, tiny, moon, of, saturn, with, another, subsurface, ocean, may, not, need, to, be, dug, as, it, releases, water, to, space, in, eruption, columns, the, space, probe, cassini, flew, inside, one, of, these, but, could, not, make, a, full, study, because, nasa, did, not, expect, this, phenomenon, and, did, not, equip, the, probe, to, study, ocean, water, still, cassini, detected, complex, organic, molecules, salts, evidence, of, hydrothermal, activity, hydrogen, and, methane, titan, is, the, only, celestial, body, in, the, solar, system, besides, earth, that, has, liquid, bodies, on, the, surface, it, has, rivers, lakes, and, rain, of, hydrocarbons, methane, and, ethane, and, even, a, cycle, similar, to, earth, s, water, cycle, this, special, context, encourages, speculations, about, lifeforms, with, different, biochemistry, but, the, cold, temperatures, would, make, such, chemistry, take, place, at, a, very, slow, pace, water, is, rock, solid, on, the, surface, but, titan, does, have, a, subsurface, water, ocean, like, several, other, moons, however, it, is, of, such, a, great, depth, that, it, would, be, very, difficult, to, access, it, for, study, the, science, that, searches, and, studies, life, in, the, universe, both, on, earth, and, elsewhere, is, called, astrobiology, with, the, study, of, earth, s, life, the, only, known, form, of, life, astrobiology, seeks, to, study, how, life, starts, and, evolves, and, the, requirements, for, its, continuous, existence, this, helps, to, determine, what, to, look, for, when, searching, for, life, in, other, celestial, bodies, this, is, a, complex, area, of, study, and, uses, the, combined, perspectives, of, several, scientific, disciplines, such, as, astronomy, biology, chemistry, geology, oceanography, and, atmospheric, sciences, the, scientific, search, for, extraterrestrial, life, is, being, carried, out, both, directly, and, indirectly, as, of, september, 2017, 3, 667, exoplanets, in, 2, 747, systems, have, been, identified, and, other, planets, and, moons, in, the, solar, system, hold, the, potential, for, hosting, primitive, life, such, as, microorganisms, as, of, 8, february, 2021, an, updated, status, of, studies, considering, the, possible, detection, of, lifeforms, on, venus, via, phosphine, and, mars, via, methane, was, reported, scientists, search, for, biosignatures, within, the, solar, system, by, studying, planetary, surfaces, and, examining, meteorites, some, claim, to, have, identified, evidence, that, microbial, life, has, existed, on, mars, in, 1996, a, controversial, report, stated, that, structures, resembling, nanobacteria, were, discovered, in, a, meteorite, alh84001, formed, of, rock, ejected, from, mars, although, all, the, unusual, properties, of, the, meteorite, were, eventually, explained, as, the, result, of, inorganic, processes, the, controversy, over, its, discovery, laid, the, groundwork, for, the, development, of, astrobiology, an, experiment, on, the, two, viking, mars, landers, reported, gas, emissions, from, heated, martian, soil, samples, that, some, scientists, argue, are, consistent, with, the, presence, of, living, microorganisms, lack, of, corroborating, evidence, from, other, experiments, on, the, same, samples, suggests, that, a, non, biological, reaction, is, a, more, likely, hypothesis, in, february, 2005, nasa, scientists, reported, they, may, have, found, some, evidence, of, extraterrestrial, life, on, mars, the, two, scientists, carol, stoker, and, larry, lemke, of, nasa, s, ames, research, center, based, their, claim, on, methane, signatures, found, in, mars, s, atmosphere, resembling, the, methane, production, of, some, forms, of, primitive, life, on, earth, as, well, as, on, their, own, study, of, primitive, life, near, the, rio, tinto, river, in, spain, nasa, officials, soon, distanced, nasa, from, the, scientists, claims, and, stoker, herself, backed, off, from, her, initial, assertions, in, november, 2011, nasa, launched, the, mars, science, laboratory, that, landed, the, curiosity, rover, on, mars, it, is, designed, to, assess, the, past, and, present, habitability, on, mars, using, a, variety, of, scientific, instruments, the, rover, landed, on, mars, at, gale, crater, in, august, 2012, a, group, of, scientists, at, cornell, university, started, a, catalog, of, microorganisms, with, the, way, each, one, reacts, to, sunlight, the, goal, is, to, help, with, the, search, for, similar, organisms, in, exoplanets, as, the, starlight, reflected, by, planets, rich, in, such, organisms, would, have, a, specific, spectrum, unlike, that, of, starlight, reflected, from, lifeless, planets, if, earth, was, studied, from, afar, with, this, system, it, would, reveal, a, shade, of, green, as, a, result, of, the, abundance, of, plants, with, photosynthesis, in, august, 2011, nasa, studied, meteorites, found, on, antarctica, finding, adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine, and, xanthine, adenine, and, guanine, are, components, of, dna, and, the, others, are, used, in, other, biological, processes, the, studies, ruled, out, pollution, of, the, meteorites, on, earth, as, those, components, would, not, be, freely, available, the, way, they, were, found, in, the, samples, this, discovery, suggests, that, several, organic, molecules, that, serve, as, building, blocks, of, life, may, be, generated, within, asteroids, and, comets, in, october, 2011, scientists, reported, that, cosmic, dust, contains, complex, organic, compounds, amorphous, organic, solids, with, a, mixed, aromatic, aliphatic, structure, that, could, be, created, naturally, and, rapidly, by, stars, it, is, still, unclear, if, those, compounds, played, a, role, in, the, creation, of, life, on, earth, but, sun, kwok, of, the, university, of, hong, kong, thinks, so, if, this, is, the, case, life, on, earth, may, have, had, an, easier, time, getting, started, as, these, organics, can, serve, as, basic, ingredients, for, life, in, august, 2012, and, in, a, world, first, astronomers, at, copenhagen, university, reported, the, detection, of, a, specific, sugar, molecule, glycolaldehyde, in, a, distant, star, system, the, molecule, was, found, around, the, protostellar, binary, iras, 16293, 2422, which, is, located, 400, light, years, from, earth, glycolaldehyde, is, needed, to, form, ribonucleic, acid, or, rna, which, is, similar, in, function, to, dna, this, finding, suggests, that, complex, organic, molecules, may, form, in, stellar, systems, prior, to, the, formation, of, planets, eventually, arriving, on, young, planets, early, in, their, formation, in, december, 2023, astronomers, reported, the, first, time, discovery, in, the, plumes, of, enceladus, moon, of, the, planet, saturn, of, hydrogen, cyanide, a, possible, chemical, essential, for, life, as, we, know, it, as, well, as, other, organic, molecules, some, of, which, are, yet, to, be, better, identified, and, understood, according, to, the, researchers, these, compounds, could, potentially, support, extant, microbial, communities, or, drive, complex, organic, synthesis, leading, to, the, origin, of, life, although, most, searches, are, focused, on, the, biology, of, extraterrestrial, life, an, extraterrestrial, intelligence, capable, enough, to, develop, a, civilization, may, be, detectable, by, other, means, as, well, technology, may, generate, technosignatures, effects, on, the, native, planet, that, may, not, be, caused, by, natural, causes, there, are, three, main, types, of, technosignatures, considered, interstellar, communications, effects, on, the, atmosphere, and, planetary, sized, structures, such, as, dyson, spheres, organizations, such, as, the, seti, institute, search, the, cosmos, for, potential, forms, of, communication, they, started, with, radio, waves, and, now, search, for, laser, pulses, as, well, the, challenge, for, this, search, is, that, there, are, natural, sources, of, such, signals, as, well, such, as, gamma, ray, bursts, and, supernovae, and, the, difference, between, a, natural, signal, and, an, artificial, one, would, be, in, its, specific, patterns, astronomers, intend, to, use, artificial, intelligence, for, this, as, it, can, manage, large, amounts, of, data, and, is, devoid, of, biases, and, preconceptions, besides, even, if, there, is, an, advanced, extraterrestrial, civilization, there, is, no, guarantee, that, it, is, transmitting, radio, communications, in, the, direction, of, earth, the, length, of, time, required, for, a, signal, to, travel, across, space, means, that, a, potential, answer, may, arrive, decades, or, centuries, after, the, initial, message, the, atmosphere, of, earth, is, rich, in, nitrogen, dioxide, as, a, result, of, air, pollution, which, can, be, detectable, the, natural, abundance, of, carbon, which, is, also, relatively, reactive, makes, it, likely, to, be, a, basic, component, of, the, development, of, a, potential, extraterrestrial, technological, civilization, as, it, is, on, earth, fossil, fuels, may, likely, be, generated, and, used, on, such, worlds, as, well, the, abundance, of, chlorofluorocarbons, in, the, atmosphere, can, also, be, a, clear, technosignature, considering, their, role, in, ozone, depletion, light, pollution, may, be, another, technosignature, as, multiple, lights, on, the, night, side, of, a, rocky, planet, can, be, a, sign, of, advanced, technological, development, however, modern, telescopes, are, not, strong, enough, to, study, exoplanets, with, the, required, level, of, detail, to, perceive, it, the, kardashev, scale, proposes, that, a, civilization, may, eventually, start, consuming, energy, directly, from, its, local, star, this, would, require, giant, structures, built, next, to, it, called, dyson, spheres, those, speculative, structures, would, cause, an, excess, infrared, radiation, that, telescopes, may, notice, the, infrared, radiation, is, typical, of, young, stars, surrounded, by, dusty, protoplanetary, disks, that, will, eventually, form, planets, an, older, star, such, as, the, sun, would, have, no, natural, reason, to, have, excess, infrared, radiation, the, presence, of, heavy, elements, in, a, star, s, light, spectrum, is, another, potential, biosignature, such, elements, would, in, theory, be, found, if, the, star, were, being, used, as, an, incinerator, repository, for, nuclear, waste, products, some, astronomers, search, for, extrasolar, planets, that, may, be, conducive, to, life, narrowing, the, search, to, terrestrial, planets, within, the, habitable, zones, of, their, stars, since, 1992, over, four, thousand, exoplanets, have, been, discovered, 7, 026, planets, in, 4, 949, planetary, systems, including, 1007, multiple, planetary, systems, as, of, 24, july, 2024, the, extrasolar, planets, so, far, discovered, range, in, size, from, that, of, terrestrial, planets, similar, to, earth, s, size, to, that, of, gas, giants, larger, than, jupiter, the, number, of, observed, exoplanets, is, expected, to, increase, greatly, in, the, coming, years, the, kepler, space, telescope, has, also, detected, a, few, thousand, candidate, planets, of, which, about, 11, may, be, false, positives, there, is, at, least, one, planet, on, average, per, star, about, 1, in, 5, sun, like, stars, have, an, earth, sized, planet, in, the, habitable, zone, with, the, nearest, expected, to, be, within, 12, light, years, distance, from, earth, assuming, 200, billion, stars, in, the, milky, way, that, would, be, 11, billion, potentially, habitable, earth, sized, planets, in, the, milky, way, rising, to, 40, billion, if, red, dwarfs, are, included, the, rogue, planets, in, the, milky, way, possibly, number, in, the, trillions, the, nearest, known, exoplanet, is, proxima, centauri, b, located, 4, 2, light, years, 1, 3, pc, from, earth, in, the, southern, constellation, of, centaurus, as, of, march, 2014, the, least, massive, exoplanet, known, is, psr, b1257, 12, a, which, is, about, twice, the, mass, of, the, moon, the, most, massive, planet, listed, on, the, nasa, exoplanet, archive, is, denis, p, j082303, 1, 491201, b, about, 29, times, the, mass, of, jupiter, although, according, to, most, definitions, of, a, planet, it, is, too, massive, to, be, a, planet, and, may, be, a, brown, dwarf, instead, almost, all, of, the, planets, detected, so, far, are, within, the, milky, way, but, there, have, also, been, a, few, possible, detections, of, extragalactic, planets, the, study, of, planetary, habitability, also, considers, a, wide, range, of, other, factors, in, determining, the, suitability, of, a, planet, for, hosting, life, one, sign, that, a, planet, probably, already, contains, life, is, the, presence, of, an, atmosphere, with, significant, amounts, of, oxygen, since, that, gas, is, highly, reactive, and, generally, would, not, last, long, without, constant, replenishment, this, replenishment, occurs, on, earth, through, photosynthetic, organisms, one, way, to, analyse, the, atmosphere, of, an, exoplanet, is, through, spectrography, when, it, transits, its, star, though, this, might, only, be, feasible, with, dim, stars, like, white, dwarfs, the, modern, concept, of, extraterrestrial, life, is, based, on, assumptions, that, were, not, commonplace, during, the, early, days, of, astronomy, the, first, explanations, for, the, celestial, objects, seen, in, the, night, sky, were, based, on, mythology, scholars, from, ancient, greece, were, the, first, to, consider, that, the, universe, is, inherently, understandable, and, rejected, explanations, based, on, supernatural, incomprehensible, forces, such, as, the, myth, of, the, sun, being, pulled, across, the, sky, in, the, chariot, of, apollo, they, had, not, developed, the, scientific, method, yet, and, based, their, ideas, on, pure, thought, and, speculation, but, they, developed, precursor, ideas, to, it, such, as, that, explanations, had, to, be, discarded, if, they, contradict, observable, facts, the, discussions, of, those, greek, scholars, established, many, of, the, pillars, that, would, eventually, lead, to, the, idea, of, extraterrestrial, life, such, as, earth, being, round, and, not, flat, the, cosmos, was, first, structured, in, a, geocentric, model, that, considered, that, the, sun, and, all, other, celestial, bodies, revolve, around, earth, however, they, did, not, consider, them, as, worlds, in, greek, understanding, the, world, was, composed, by, both, earth, and, the, celestial, objects, with, noticeable, movements, anaximander, thought, that, the, cosmos, was, made, from, apeiron, a, substance, that, created, the, world, and, that, the, world, would, eventually, return, to, the, cosmos, eventually, two, groups, emerged, the, atomists, that, thought, that, matter, at, both, earth, and, the, cosmos, was, equally, made, of, small, atoms, of, the, classical, elements, earth, water, fire, and, air, and, the, aristotelians, who, thought, that, those, elements, were, exclusive, of, earth, and, that, the, cosmos, was, made, of, a, fifth, one, the, aether, atomist, epicurus, thought, that, the, processes, that, created, the, world, its, animals, and, plants, should, have, created, other, worlds, elsewhere, along, with, their, own, animals, and, plants, aristotle, thought, instead, that, all, the, earth, element, naturally, fell, towards, the, center, of, the, universe, and, that, would, made, it, impossible, for, other, planets, to, exist, elsewhere, under, that, reasoning, earth, was, not, only, in, the, center, it, was, also, the, only, planet, in, the, universe, cosmic, pluralism, the, plurality, of, worlds, or, simply, pluralism, describes, the, philosophical, belief, in, numerous, worlds, in, addition, to, earth, which, might, harbor, extraterrestrial, life, the, earliest, recorded, assertion, of, extraterrestrial, human, life, is, found, in, ancient, scriptures, of, jainism, there, are, multiple, worlds, mentioned, in, jain, scriptures, that, support, human, life, these, include, among, others, bharat, kshetra, mahavideh, kshetra, airavat, kshetra, and, hari, kshetra, medieval, muslim, writers, like, fakhr, al, din, al, razi, and, muhammad, al, baqir, supported, cosmic, pluralism, on, the, basis, of, the, qur, an, chaucer, s, poem, the, house, of, fame, engaged, in, medieval, thought, experiments, that, postulated, the, plurality, of, worlds, however, those, ideas, about, other, worlds, were, different, from, the, current, knowledge, about, the, structure, of, the, universe, and, did, not, postulate, the, existence, of, planetary, systems, other, than, the, solar, system, when, those, authors, talk, about, other, worlds, they, talk, about, places, located, at, the, center, of, their, own, systems, and, with, their, own, stellar, vaults, and, cosmos, surrounding, them, the, greek, ideas, and, the, disputes, between, atomists, and, aristotelians, outlived, the, fall, of, the, greek, empire, the, great, library, of, alexandria, compiled, information, about, it, part, of, which, was, translated, by, islamic, scholars, and, thus, survived, the, end, of, the, library, baghdad, combined, the, knowledge, of, the, greeks, the, indians, the, chinese, and, its, own, scholars, and, the, knowledge, expanded, through, the, byzantine, empire, from, there, it, eventually, returned, to, europe, by, the, time, of, the, middle, ages, however, as, the, greek, atomist, doctrine, held, that, the, world, was, created, by, random, movements, of, atoms, with, no, need, for, a, creator, deity, it, became, associated, with, atheism, and, the, dispute, intertwined, with, religious, ones, still, the, church, did, not, react, to, those, topics, in, a, homogeneous, way, and, there, were, stricter, and, more, permissive, views, within, the, church, itself, the, first, known, mention, of, the, term, panspermia, was, in, the, writings, of, the, 5th, century, bc, greek, philosopher, anaxagoras, he, proposed, the, idea, that, life, exists, everywhere, by, the, time, of, the, late, middle, ages, there, were, many, known, inaccuracies, in, the, geocentric, model, but, it, was, kept, in, use, because, naked, eye, observations, provided, limited, data, nicolaus, copernicus, started, the, copernican, revolution, by, proposing, that, the, planets, revolve, around, the, sun, rather, than, earth, his, proposal, had, little, acceptance, at, first, because, as, he, kept, the, assumption, that, orbits, were, perfect, circles, his, model, led, to, as, many, inaccuracies, as, the, geocentric, one, tycho, brahe, improved, the, available, data, with, naked, eye, observatories, which, worked, with, highly, complex, sextants, and, quadrants, tycho, could, not, make, sense, of, his, observations, but, johannes, kepler, did, orbits, were, not, perfect, circles, but, ellipses, this, knowledge, benefited, the, copernican, model, which, worked, now, almost, perfectly, the, invention, of, the, telescope, a, short, time, later, perfected, by, galileo, galilei, clarified, the, final, doubts, and, the, paradigm, shift, was, completed, under, this, new, understanding, the, notion, of, extraterrestrial, life, became, feasible, if, earth, is, but, just, a, planet, orbiting, around, a, star, there, may, be, planets, similar, to, earth, elsewhere, the, astronomical, study, of, distant, bodies, also, proved, that, physical, laws, are, the, same, elsewhere, in, the, universe, as, on, earth, with, nothing, making, the, planet, truly, special, the, new, ideas, were, met, with, resistance, from, the, catholic, church, galileo, was, trialed, for, the, heliocentric, model, which, was, considered, heretical, and, forced, to, recant, it, the, best, known, early, modern, proponent, of, ideas, of, extraterrestrial, life, was, the, italian, philosopher, giordano, bruno, who, argued, in, the, 16th, century, for, an, infinite, universe, in, which, every, star, is, surrounded, by, its, own, planetary, system, bruno, wrote, that, other, worlds, have, no, less, virtue, nor, a, nature, different, to, that, of, our, earth, and, like, earth, contain, animals, and, inhabitants, bruno, s, belief, in, the, plurality, of, worlds, was, one, of, the, charges, leveled, against, him, by, the, venetian, holy, inquisition, which, trialed, and, executed, him, the, heliocentric, model, was, further, strengthened, by, the, postulation, of, the, theory, of, gravity, by, sir, isaac, newton, this, theory, provided, the, mathematics, that, explains, the, motions, of, all, things, in, the, universe, including, planetary, orbits, by, this, point, the, geocentric, model, was, definitely, discarded, by, this, time, the, use, of, the, scientific, method, had, become, a, standard, and, new, discoveries, were, expected, to, provide, evidence, and, rigorous, mathematical, explanations, science, also, took, a, deeper, interest, in, the, mechanics, of, natural, phenomena, trying, to, explain, not, just, the, way, nature, works, but, also, the, reasons, for, working, that, way, there, was, very, little, actual, discussion, about, extraterrestrial, life, before, this, point, as, the, aristotlean, ideas, remained, influential, while, geocentrism, was, still, accepted, when, it, was, finally, proved, wrong, it, not, only, meant, that, earth, was, not, the, center, of, the, universe, but, also, that, the, lights, seen, in, the, sky, were, not, just, lights, but, physical, objects, the, notion, that, life, may, exist, in, them, as, well, soon, became, an, ongoing, topic, of, discussion, although, one, with, no, practical, ways, to, investigate, the, possibility, of, extraterrestrials, remained, a, widespread, speculation, as, scientific, discovery, accelerated, william, herschel, the, discoverer, of, uranus, was, one, of, many, 18th, 19th, century, astronomers, who, believed, that, the, solar, system, is, populated, by, alien, life, other, scholars, of, the, period, who, championed, cosmic, pluralism, included, immanuel, kant, and, benjamin, franklin, at, the, height, of, the, enlightenment, even, the, sun, and, moon, were, considered, candidates, for, extraterrestrial, inhabitants, speculation, about, life, on, mars, increased, in, the, late, 19th, century, following, telescopic, observation, of, apparent, martian, canals, which, soon, however, turned, out, to, be, optical, illusions, despite, this, in, 1895, american, astronomer, percival, lowell, published, his, book, mars, followed, by, mars, and, its, canals, in, 1906, proposing, that, the, canals, were, the, work, of, a, long, gone, civilisation, spectroscopic, analysis, of, mars, s, atmosphere, began, in, earnest, in, 1894, when, u, s, astronomer, william, wallace, campbell, showed, that, neither, water, nor, oxygen, was, present, in, the, martian, atmosphere, by, 1909, better, telescopes, and, the, best, perihelic, opposition, of, mars, since, 1877, conclusively, put, an, end, to, the, canal, hypothesis, as, a, consequence, of, the, belief, in, the, spontaneous, generation, there, was, little, thought, about, the, conditions, of, each, celestial, body, it, was, simply, assumed, that, life, would, thrive, anywhere, this, theory, was, disproved, by, louis, pasteur, in, the, 19th, century, popular, belief, in, thriving, alien, civilisations, elsewhere, in, the, solar, system, still, remained, strong, until, mariner, 4, and, mariner, 9, provided, close, images, of, mars, which, debunked, forever, the, idea, of, the, existence, of, martians, and, decreased, the, previous, expectations, of, finding, alien, life, in, general, the, end, of, the, spontaneous, generation, belief, forced, to, investigate, the, origin, of, life, although, abiogenesis, is, the, more, accepted, theory, a, number, of, authors, reclaimed, the, term, panspermia, and, proposed, that, life, was, brought, to, earth, from, elsewhere, some, of, those, authors, are, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, 1834, kelvin, 1871, hermann, von, helmholtz, 1879, and, somewhat, later, by, svante, arrhenius, 1903, the, science, fiction, genre, although, not, so, named, during, the, time, developed, during, the, late, 19th, century, the, expansion, of, the, genre, of, extraterrestrials, in, fiction, influenced, the, popular, perception, over, the, real, life, topic, making, people, eager, to, jump, to, conclusions, about, the, discovery, of, aliens, science, marched, at, a, slower, pace, some, discoveries, fueled, expectations, and, others, dashed, excessive, hopes, for, example, with, the, advent, of, telescopes, most, structures, seen, on, the, moon, or, mars, were, immediately, attributed, to, selenites, or, martians, and, later, ones, such, as, more, powerful, telescopes, revealed, that, all, such, discoveries, were, natural, features, a, famous, case, is, the, cydonia, region, of, mars, first, imaged, by, the, viking, 1, orbiter, the, low, resolution, photos, showed, a, rock, formation, that, resembled, a, human, face, but, later, spacecraft, took, photos, in, higher, detail, that, showed, that, there, was, nothing, special, about, the, site, the, search, and, study, of, extraterrestrial, life, became, a, science, of, its, own, astrobiology, also, known, as, exobiology, this, discipline, is, studied, by, the, nasa, the, esa, the, inaf, and, others, astrobiology, studies, life, from, earth, as, well, but, with, a, cosmic, perspective, for, example, abiogenesis, is, of, interest, to, astrobiology, not, because, of, the, origin, of, life, on, earth, but, for, the, chances, of, a, similar, process, taking, place, in, other, celestial, bodies, many, aspects, of, life, from, its, definition, to, its, chemistry, are, analyzed, as, either, likely, to, be, similar, in, all, forms, of, life, across, the, cosmos, or, only, native, to, earth, astrobiology, however, remains, constrained, by, the, current, lack, of, extraterrestrial, lifeforms, to, study, as, all, life, on, earth, comes, from, the, same, ancestor, and, it, is, hard, to, infer, general, characteristics, from, a, group, with, a, single, example, to, analyse, the, 20th, century, came, with, great, technological, advances, speculations, about, future, hypothetical, technologies, and, an, increased, basic, knowledge, of, science, by, the, general, population, thanks, to, science, divulgation, through, the, mass, media, the, public, interest, in, extraterrestrial, life, and, the, lack, of, discoveries, by, mainstream, science, led, to, the, emergence, of, pseudosciences, that, provided, affirmative, if, questionable, answers, to, the, existence, of, aliens, ufology, claims, that, many, unidentified, flying, objects, ufos, would, be, spaceships, from, alien, species, and, ancient, astronauts, hypothesis, claim, that, aliens, would, have, visited, earth, in, antiquity, and, prehistoric, times, but, people, would, have, failed, to, understand, it, by, then, most, ufos, or, ufo, sightings, can, be, readily, explained, as, sightings, of, earth, based, aircraft, including, top, secret, aircraft, known, astronomical, objects, or, weather, phenomenons, or, as, hoaxes, looking, beyond, the, psudosciences, lewis, white, beck, strove, to, elevate, the, level, of, public, discourse, on, the, topic, of, extraterrestrial, life, by, tracing, the, evolution, of, philosophical, thought, over, the, centuries, from, ancient, times, into, the, modern, era, his, review, of, the, contributions, made, by, lucretius, plutarch, aristotle, copernicus, immanuel, kant, thomas, wilkins, charles, darwin, and, karl, marx, demonstrated, that, even, in, modern, times, humanity, could, be, profoundly, influenced, in, its, search, for, extraterrestrial, life, by, subtle, and, comforting, archetypal, ideas, which, are, largely, derived, from, firmly, held, religious, philosophical, and, existential, belief, systems, on, a, positive, note, however, beck, further, argued, that, even, if, the, search, for, extraterrestrial, life, proves, to, be, unsuccessful, the, endeavor, itself, could, have, beneficial, consequences, by, assisting, humanity, in, its, attempt, to, actualize, superior, ways, of, living, here, on, earth, by, the, 21st, century, it, was, accepted, that, multicellular, life, in, the, solar, system, can, only, exist, on, earth, but, the, interest, in, extraterrestrial, life, increased, regardless, this, is, a, result, of, the, advances, in, several, sciences, the, knowledge, of, planetary, habitability, allows, to, consider, on, scientific, terms, the, likelihood, of, finding, life, at, each, specific, celestial, body, as, it, is, known, which, features, are, beneficial, and, harmful, for, life, astronomy, and, telescopes, also, improved, to, the, point, exoplanets, can, be, confirmed, and, even, studied, increasing, the, number, of, search, places, life, may, still, exist, elsewhere, in, the, solar, system, in, unicellular, form, but, the, advances, in, spacecraft, allow, to, send, robots, to, study, samples, in, situ, with, tools, of, growing, complexity, and, reliability, although, no, extraterrestrial, life, has, been, found, and, life, may, still, be, just, a, rarity, from, earth, there, are, scientific, reasons, to, suspect, that, it, can, exist, elsewhere, and, technological, advances, that, may, detect, it, if, it, does, many, scientists, are, optimistic, about, the, chances, of, finding, alien, life, in, the, words, of, seti, s, frank, drake, all, we, know, for, sure, is, that, the, sky, is, not, littered, with, powerful, microwave, transmitters, drake, noted, that, it, is, entirely, possible, that, advanced, technology, results, in, communication, being, carried, out, in, some, way, other, than, conventional, radio, transmission, at, the, same, time, the, data, returned, by, space, probes, and, giant, strides, in, detection, methods, have, allowed, science, to, begin, delineating, habitability, criteria, on, other, worlds, and, to, confirm, that, at, least, other, planets, are, plentiful, though, aliens, remain, a, question, mark, the, wow, signal, detected, in, 1977, by, a, seti, project, remains, a, subject, of, speculative, debate, on, the, other, hand, other, scientists, are, pessimistic, jacques, monod, wrote, that, man, knows, at, last, that, he, is, alone, in, the, indifferent, immensity, of, the, universe, whence, which, he, has, emerged, by, chance, in, 2000, geologist, and, paleontologist, peter, ward, and, astrobiologist, donald, brownlee, published, a, book, entitled, rare, earth, why, complex, life, is, uncommon, in, the, universe, in, it, they, discussed, the, rare, earth, hypothesis, in, which, they, claim, that, earth, like, life, is, rare, in, the, universe, whereas, microbial, life, is, common, ward, and, brownlee, are, open, to, the, idea, of, evolution, on, other, planets, that, is, not, based, on, essential, earth, like, characteristics, such, as, dna, and, carbon, as, for, the, possible, risks, theoretical, physicist, stephen, hawking, warned, in, 2010, that, humans, should, not, try, to, contact, alien, life, forms, he, warned, that, aliens, might, pillage, earth, for, resources, if, aliens, visit, us, the, outcome, would, be, much, as, when, columbus, landed, in, america, which, didn, t, turn, out, well, for, the, native, americans, he, said, jared, diamond, had, earlier, expressed, similar, concerns, on, 20, july, 2015, hawking, and, russian, billionaire, yuri, milner, along, with, the, seti, institute, announced, a, well, funded, effort, called, the, breakthrough, initiatives, to, expand, efforts, to, search, for, extraterrestrial, life, the, group, contracted, the, services, of, the, 100, meter, robert, c, byrd, green, bank, telescope, in, west, virginia, in, the, united, states, and, the, 64, meter, parkes, telescope, in, new, south, wales, australia, on, 13, february, 2015, scientists, including, geoffrey, marcy, seth, shostak, frank, drake, and, david, brin, at, a, convention, of, the, american, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, discussed, active, seti, and, whether, transmitting, a, message, to, possible, intelligent, extraterrestrials, in, the, cosmos, was, a, good, idea, one, result, was, a, statement, signed, by, many, that, a, worldwide, scientific, political, and, humanitarian, discussion, must, occur, before, any, message, is, sent, although, the, idea, of, extraterrestrial, peoples, became, feasible, once, astronomy, developed, enough, to, understand, the, nature, of, planets, they, were, not, thought, of, as, being, any, different, from, humans, having, no, scientific, explanation, for, the, origin, of, mankind, and, its, relation, to, other, species, there, was, no, reason, to, expect, them, to, be, any, other, way, this, was, changed, by, the, 1859, book, on, the, origin, of, species, by, charles, darwin, which, proposed, the, theory, of, evolution, now, with, the, notion, that, evolution, on, other, planets, may, take, other, directions, science, fiction, authors, created, bizarre, aliens, clearly, distinct, from, humans, a, usual, way, to, do, that, was, to, add, body, features, from, other, animals, such, as, insects, or, octopuses, costuming, and, special, effects, feasibility, alongside, budget, considerations, forced, films, and, tv, series, to, tone, down, the, fantasy, but, these, limitations, lessened, since, the, 1990s, with, the, advent, of, computer, generated, imagery, cgi, and, later, on, as, cgi, became, more, effective, and, less, expensive, real, life, events, sometimes, captivate, people, s, imagination, and, this, influences, the, works, of, fiction, for, example, during, the, barney, and, betty, hill, incident, the, first, recorded, claim, of, an, alien, abduction, the, couple, reported, that, they, were, abducted, and, experimented, on, by, aliens, with, oversized, heads, big, eyes, pale, grey, skin, and, small, noses, a, description, that, eventually, became, the, grey, alien, archetype, once, used, in, works, of, fiction, the, 1967, outer, space, treaty, and, the, 1979, moon, agreement, define, rules, of, planetary, protection, against, potentially, hazardous, extraterrestrial, life, cospar, also, provides, guidelines, for, planetary, protection, a, committee, of, the, united, nations, office, for, outer, space, affairs, had, in, 1977, discussed, for, a, year, strategies, for, interacting, with, extraterrestrial, life, or, intelligence, the, discussion, ended, without, any, conclusions, as, of, 2010, the, un, lacks, response, mechanisms, for, the, case, of, an, extraterrestrial, contact, one, of, the, nasa, divisions, is, the, office, of, safety, and, mission, assurance, osma, also, known, as, the, planetary, protection, office, a, part, of, its, mission, is, to, rigorously, preclude, backward, contamination, of, earth, by, extraterrestrial, life, in, 2016, the, chinese, government, released, a, white, paper, detailing, its, space, program, according, to, the, document, one, of, the, research, objectives, of, the, program, is, the, search, for, extraterrestrial, life, it, is, also, one, of, the, objectives, of, the, chinese, five, hundred, meter, aperture, spherical, telescope, fast, program, in, 2020, dmitry, rogozin, the, head, of, the, russian, space, agency, said, the, search, for, extraterrestrial, life, is, one, of, the, main, goals, of, deep, space, research, he, also, acknowledged, the, possibility, of, existence, of, primitive, life, on, other, planets, of, the, solar, system, the, french, space, agency, has, an, office, for, the, study, of, non, identified, aero, spatial, phenomena, the, agency, is, maintaining, a, publicly, accessible, database, of, such, phenomena, with, over, 1600, detailed, entries, according, to, the, head, of, the, office, the, vast, majority, of, entries, have, a, mundane, explanation, but, for, 25, of, entries, their, extraterrestrial, origin, can, neither, be, confirmed, nor, denied, in, 2020, chairman, of, the, israel, space, agency, isaac, ben, israel, stated, that, the, probability, of, detecting, life, in, outer, space, is, quite, large, but, he, disagrees, with, his, former, colleague, haim, eshed, who, stated, that, there, are, contacts, between, an, advanced, alien, civilisation, and, some, of, earth, s, governments
