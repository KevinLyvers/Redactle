density, volumetric, mass, density, or, specific, mass, is, a, substance, s, mass, per, unit, of, volume, the, symbol, most, often, used, for, density, is, the, lower, case, greek, letter, rho, although, the, latin, letter, d, can, also, be, used, mathematically, density, is, defined, as, mass, divided, by, volume, m, v, displaystyle, rho, frac, m, v, where, is, the, density, m, is, the, mass, and, v, is, the, volume, in, some, cases, for, instance, in, the, united, states, oil, and, gas, industry, density, is, loosely, defined, as, its, weight, per, unit, volume, although, this, is, scientifically, inaccurate, this, quantity, is, more, specifically, called, specific, weight, for, a, pure, substance, the, density, has, the, same, numerical, value, as, its, mass, concentration, different, materials, usually, have, different, densities, and, density, may, be, relevant, to, buoyancy, purity, and, packaging, osmium, is, the, densest, known, element, at, standard, conditions, for, temperature, and, pressure, to, simplify, comparisons, of, density, across, different, systems, of, units, it, is, sometimes, replaced, by, the, dimensionless, quantity, relative, density, or, specific, gravity, i, e, the, ratio, of, the, density, of, the, material, to, that, of, a, standard, material, usually, water, thus, a, relative, density, less, than, one, relative, to, water, means, that, the, substance, floats, in, water, the, density, of, a, material, varies, with, temperature, and, pressure, this, variation, is, typically, small, for, solids, and, liquids, but, much, greater, for, gases, increasing, the, pressure, on, an, object, decreases, the, volume, of, the, object, and, thus, increases, its, density, increasing, the, temperature, of, a, substance, with, a, few, exceptions, decreases, its, density, by, increasing, its, volume, in, most, materials, heating, the, bottom, of, a, fluid, results, in, convection, of, the, heat, from, the, bottom, to, the, top, due, to, the, decrease, in, the, density, of, the, heated, fluid, which, causes, it, to, rise, relative, to, denser, unheated, material, the, reciprocal, of, the, density, of, a, substance, is, occasionally, called, its, specific, volume, a, term, sometimes, used, in, thermodynamics, density, is, an, intensive, property, in, that, increasing, the, amount, of, a, substance, does, not, increase, its, density, rather, it, increases, its, mass, other, conceptually, comparable, quantities, or, ratios, include, specific, density, relative, density, specific, gravity, and, specific, weight, the, understanding, that, different, materials, have, different, densities, and, of, a, relationship, between, density, floating, and, sinking, must, date, to, prehistoric, times, much, later, it, was, put, in, writing, aristotle, for, example, wrote, there, is, so, great, a, difference, in, density, between, salt, and, fresh, water, that, vessels, laden, with, cargoes, of, the, same, weight, almost, sink, in, rivers, but, ride, quite, easily, at, sea, and, are, quite, seaworthy, and, an, ignorance, of, this, has, sometimes, cost, people, dear, who, load, their, ships, in, rivers, the, following, is, a, proof, that, the, density, of, a, fluid, is, greater, when, a, substance, is, mixed, with, it, if, you, make, water, very, salt, by, mixing, salt, in, with, it, eggs, will, float, on, it, if, there, were, any, truth, in, the, stories, they, tell, about, the, lake, in, palestine, it, would, further, bear, out, what, i, say, for, they, say, if, you, bind, a, man, or, beast, and, throw, him, into, it, he, floats, and, does, not, sink, beneath, the, surface, in, a, well, known, but, probably, apocryphal, tale, archimedes, was, given, the, task, of, determining, whether, king, hiero, s, goldsmith, was, embezzling, gold, during, the, manufacture, of, a, golden, wreath, dedicated, to, the, gods, and, replacing, it, with, another, cheaper, alloy, archimedes, knew, that, the, irregularly, shaped, wreath, could, be, crushed, into, a, cube, whose, volume, could, be, calculated, easily, and, compared, with, the, mass, but, the, king, did, not, approve, of, this, baffled, archimedes, is, said, to, have, taken, an, immersion, bath, and, observed, from, the, rise, of, the, water, upon, entering, that, he, could, calculate, the, volume, of, the, gold, wreath, through, the, displacement, of, the, water, upon, this, discovery, he, leapt, from, his, bath, and, ran, naked, through, the, streets, shouting, eureka, eureka, ancient, greek, lit, i, have, found, it, as, a, result, the, term, eureka, entered, common, parlance, and, is, used, today, to, indicate, a, moment, of, enlightenment, the, story, first, appeared, in, written, form, in, vitruvius, books, of, architecture, two, centuries, after, it, supposedly, took, place, some, scholars, have, doubted, the, accuracy, of, this, tale, saying, among, other, things, that, the, method, would, have, required, precise, measurements, that, would, have, been, difficult, to, make, at, the, time, nevertheless, in, 1586, galileo, galilei, in, one, of, his, first, experiments, made, a, possible, reconstruction, of, how, the, experiment, could, have, been, performed, with, ancient, greek, resources, from, the, equation, for, density, m, v, mass, density, has, any, unit, that, is, mass, divided, by, volume, as, there, are, many, units, of, mass, and, volume, covering, many, different, magnitudes, there, are, a, large, number, of, units, for, mass, density, in, use, the, si, unit, of, kilogram, per, cubic, metre, kg, m, 3, and, the, cgs, unit, of, gram, per, cubic, centimetre, g, cm, 3, are, probably, the, most, commonly, used, units, for, density, one, g, cm, 3, is, equal, to, 1000, kg, m, 3, one, cubic, centimetre, abbreviation, cc, is, equal, to, one, millilitre, in, industry, other, larger, or, smaller, units, of, mass, and, or, volume, are, often, more, practical, and, us, customary, units, may, be, used, see, below, for, a, list, of, some, of, the, most, common, units, of, density, the, litre, and, tonne, are, not, part, of, the, si, but, are, acceptable, for, use, with, it, leading, to, the, following, units, densities, using, the, following, metric, units, all, have, exactly, the, same, numerical, value, one, thousandth, of, the, value, in, kg, m, 3, liquid, water, has, a, density, of, about, 1, kg, dm, 3, making, any, of, these, si, units, numerically, convenient, to, use, as, most, solids, and, liquids, have, densities, between, 0, 1, and, 20, kg, dm, 3, in, us, customary, units, density, can, be, stated, in, imperial, units, differing, from, the, above, as, the, imperial, gallon, and, bushel, differ, from, the, us, units, in, practice, are, rarely, used, though, found, in, older, documents, the, imperial, gallon, was, based, on, the, concept, that, an, imperial, fluid, ounce, of, water, would, have, a, mass, of, one, avoirdupois, ounce, and, indeed, 1, g, cm, 3, 1, 00224129, ounces, per, imperial, fluid, ounce, 10, 0224129, pounds, per, imperial, gallon, the, density, of, precious, metals, could, conceivably, be, based, on, troy, ounces, and, pounds, a, possible, cause, of, confusion, knowing, the, volume, of, the, unit, cell, of, a, crystalline, material, and, its, formula, weight, in, daltons, the, density, can, be, calculated, one, dalton, per, cubic, ngstr, m, is, equal, to, a, density, of, 1, 660, 539, 066, 60, g, cm, 3, a, number, of, techniques, as, well, as, standards, exist, for, the, measurement, of, density, of, materials, such, techniques, include, the, use, of, a, hydrometer, a, buoyancy, method, for, liquids, hydrostatic, balance, a, buoyancy, method, for, liquids, and, solids, immersed, body, method, a, buoyancy, method, for, liquids, pycnometer, liquids, and, solids, air, comparison, pycnometer, solids, oscillating, densitometer, liquids, as, well, as, pour, and, tap, solids, however, each, individual, method, or, technique, measures, different, types, of, density, e, g, bulk, density, skeletal, density, etc, and, therefore, it, is, necessary, to, have, an, understanding, of, the, type, of, density, being, measured, as, well, as, the, type, of, material, in, question, the, density, at, all, points, of, a, homogeneous, object, equals, its, total, mass, divided, by, its, total, volume, the, mass, is, normally, measured, with, a, scale, or, balance, the, volume, may, be, measured, directly, from, the, geometry, of, the, object, or, by, the, displacement, of, a, fluid, to, determine, the, density, of, a, liquid, or, a, gas, a, hydrometer, a, dasymeter, or, a, coriolis, flow, meter, may, be, used, respectively, similarly, hydrostatic, weighing, uses, the, displacement, of, water, due, to, a, submerged, object, to, determine, the, density, of, the, object, if, the, body, is, not, homogeneous, then, its, density, varies, between, different, regions, of, the, object, in, that, case, the, density, around, any, given, location, is, determined, by, calculating, the, density, of, a, small, volume, around, that, location, in, the, limit, of, an, infinitesimal, volume, the, density, of, an, inhomogeneous, object, at, a, point, becomes, r, d, m, d, v, displaystyle, rho, vec, r, dm, dv, where, d, v, displaystyle, dv, is, an, elementary, volume, at, position, r, displaystyle, vec, r, the, mass, of, the, body, then, can, be, expressed, as, m, v, r, d, v, displaystyle, m, int, v, rho, vec, r, dv, in, practice, bulk, materials, such, as, sugar, sand, or, snow, contain, voids, many, materials, exist, in, nature, as, flakes, pellets, or, granules, voids, are, regions, which, contain, something, other, than, the, considered, material, commonly, the, void, is, air, but, it, could, also, be, vacuum, liquid, solid, or, a, different, gas, or, gaseous, mixture, the, bulk, volume, of, a, material, inclusive, of, the, void, space, fraction, is, often, obtained, by, a, simple, measurement, e, g, with, a, calibrated, measuring, cup, or, geometrically, from, known, dimensions, mass, divided, by, bulk, volume, determines, bulk, density, this, is, not, the, same, thing, as, the, material, volumetric, mass, density, to, determine, the, material, volumetric, mass, density, one, must, first, discount, the, volume, of, the, void, fraction, sometimes, this, can, be, determined, by, geometrical, reasoning, for, the, close, packing, of, equal, spheres, the, non, void, fraction, can, be, at, most, about, 74, it, can, also, be, determined, empirically, some, bulk, materials, however, such, as, sand, have, a, variable, void, fraction, which, depends, on, how, the, material, is, agitated, or, poured, it, might, be, loose, or, compact, with, more, or, less, air, space, depending, on, handling, in, practice, the, void, fraction, is, not, necessarily, air, or, even, gaseous, in, the, case, of, sand, it, could, be, water, which, can, be, advantageous, for, measurement, as, the, void, fraction, for, sand, saturated, in, water, once, any, air, bubbles, are, thoroughly, driven, out, is, potentially, more, consistent, than, dry, sand, measured, with, an, air, void, in, the, case, of, non, compact, materials, one, must, also, take, care, in, determining, the, mass, of, the, material, sample, if, the, material, is, under, pressure, commonly, ambient, air, pressure, at, the, earth, s, surface, the, determination, of, mass, from, a, measured, sample, weight, might, need, to, account, for, buoyancy, effects, due, to, the, density, of, the, void, constituent, depending, on, how, the, measurement, was, conducted, in, the, case, of, dry, sand, sand, is, so, much, denser, than, air, that, the, buoyancy, effect, is, commonly, neglected, less, than, one, part, in, one, thousand, mass, change, upon, displacing, one, void, material, with, another, while, maintaining, constant, volume, can, be, used, to, estimate, the, void, fraction, if, the, difference, in, density, of, the, two, voids, materials, is, reliably, known, in, general, density, can, be, changed, by, changing, either, the, pressure, or, the, temperature, increasing, the, pressure, always, increases, the, density, of, a, material, increasing, the, temperature, generally, decreases, the, density, but, there, are, notable, exceptions, to, this, generalization, for, example, the, density, of, water, increases, between, its, melting, point, at, 0, c, and, 4, c, similar, behavior, is, observed, in, silicon, at, low, temperatures, the, effect, of, pressure, and, temperature, on, the, densities, of, liquids, and, solids, is, small, the, compressibility, for, a, typical, liquid, or, solid, is, 10, 6, bar, 1, 1, bar, 0, 1, mpa, and, a, typical, thermal, expansivity, is, 10, 5, k, 1, this, roughly, translates, into, needing, around, ten, thousand, times, atmospheric, pressure, to, reduce, the, volume, of, a, substance, by, one, percent, although, the, pressures, needed, may, be, around, a, thousand, times, smaller, for, sandy, soil, and, some, clays, a, one, percent, expansion, of, volume, typically, requires, a, temperature, increase, on, the, order, of, thousands, of, degrees, celsius, in, contrast, the, density, of, gases, is, strongly, affected, by, pressure, the, density, of, an, ideal, gas, is, m, p, r, t, displaystyle, rho, frac, mp, rt, where, m, is, the, molar, mass, p, is, the, pressure, r, is, the, universal, gas, constant, and, t, is, the, absolute, temperature, this, means, that, the, density, of, an, ideal, gas, can, be, doubled, by, doubling, the, pressure, or, by, halving, the, absolute, temperature, in, the, case, of, volumic, thermal, expansion, at, constant, pressure, and, small, intervals, of, temperature, the, temperature, dependence, of, density, is, t, 0, 1, t, displaystyle, rho, frac, rho, t, 0, 1, alpha, cdot, delta, t, where, t, 0, displaystyle, rho, t, 0, is, the, density, at, a, reference, temperature, displaystyle, alpha, is, the, thermal, expansion, coefficient, of, the, material, at, temperatures, close, to, t, 0, displaystyle, t, 0, the, density, of, a, solution, is, the, sum, of, mass, massic, concentrations, of, the, components, of, that, solution, mass, massic, concentration, of, each, given, component, i, displaystyle, rho, i, in, a, solution, sums, to, density, of, the, solution, i, i, displaystyle, rho, sum, i, rho, i, expressed, as, a, function, of, the, densities, of, pure, components, of, the, mixture, and, their, volume, participation, it, allows, the, determination, of, excess, molar, volumes, i, i, v, i, v, i, i, i, i, i, v, i, i, v, i, i, v, e, i, displaystyle, rho, sum, i, rho, i, frac, v, i, v, sum, i, rho, i, varphi, i, sum, i, rho, i, frac,

components, one, can, determine, the, activity, coefficients, v, e, i, r, t, ln, i, p, displaystyle, overline, v, e, i, rt, frac, partial, ln, gamma, i, partial, p
