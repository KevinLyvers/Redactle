ethanol, also, called, ethyl, alcohol, grain, alcohol, drinking, alcohol, or, simply, alcohol, is, an, organic, compound, with, the, chemical, formula, ch, 3, ch, 2, oh, it, is, an, alcohol, with, its, formula, also, written, as, c, 2, h, 5, oh, c, 2, h, 6, o, or, etoh, where, et, stands, for, ethyl, ethanol, is, a, volatile, flammable, colorless, liquid, with, a, characteristic, wine, like, odor, and, pungent, taste, in, nature, grape, sugar, breaks, up, by, the, action, of, fermentation, into, alcohol, or, carbonic, acid, without, anything, being, added, as, a, psychoactive, depressant, it, is, the, active, ingredient, in, alcoholic, drinks, and, the, second, most, consumed, drug, globally, behind, caffeine, ethanol, is, naturally, produced, by, the, fermentation, process, of, sugars, by, yeasts, or, via, petrochemical, processes, such, as, ethylene, hydration, historically, it, was, used, as, a, general, anesthetic, and, has, modern, medical, applications, as, an, antiseptic, disinfectant, solvent, for, some, medications, and, antidote, for, methanol, poisoning, and, ethylene, glycol, poisoning, it, is, used, as, a, chemical, solvent, and, in, the, synthesis, of, organic, compounds, and, as, a, fuel, source, for, lamps, stoves, and, internal, combustion, engines, ethanol, also, can, be, dehydrated, to, make, ethylene, an, important, chemical, feedstock, as, of, 2023, world, production, of, ethanol, fuel, was, 29, 590, 000, 000, us, gallons, 112, 0, gigalitres, coming, mostly, from, the, u, s, 51, and, brazil, 26, ethanol, is, the, systematic, name, defined, by, the, international, union, of, pure, and, applied, chemistry, for, a, compound, consisting, of, an, alkyl, group, with, two, carbon, atoms, prefix, eth, having, a, single, bond, between, them, infix, an, and, an, attached, oh, functional, group, suffix, ol, the, eth, prefix, and, the, qualifier, ethyl, in, ethyl, alcohol, originally, came, from, the, name, ethyl, assigned, in, 1834, to, the, group, c, 2, h, 5, by, justus, liebig, he, coined, the, word, from, the, german, name, aether, of, the, compound, c, 2, h, 5, o, c, 2, h, 5, commonly, called, ether, in, english, more, specifically, called, diethyl, ether, according, to, the, oxford, english, dictionary, ethyl, is, a, contraction, of, the, ancient, greek, aith, r, upper, air, and, the, greek, word, h, l, wood, raw, material, hence, matter, substance, the, name, ethanol, was, coined, as, a, result, of, a, resolution, on, naming, alcohols, and, phenols, that, was, adopted, at, the, international, conference, on, chemical, nomenclature, that, was, held, in, april, 1892, in, geneva, switzerland, the, term, alcohol, now, refers, to, a, wider, class, of, substances, in, chemistry, nomenclature, but, in, common, parlance, it, remains, the, name, of, ethanol, it, is, a, medieval, loan, from, arabic, al, ku, l, a, powdered, ore, of, antimony, used, since, antiquity, as, a, cosmetic, and, retained, that, meaning, in, middle, latin, the, use, of, alcohol, for, ethanol, in, full, alcohol, of, wine, is, modern, and, was, first, recorded, in, 1753, before, the, late, 18th, century, the, term, alcohol, generally, referred, to, any, sublimated, substance, ethanol, is, the, oldest, known, sedative, used, as, an, oral, general, anesthetic, during, surgery, in, ancient, mesopotamia, and, in, medieval, times, mild, intoxication, starts, at, a, blood, alcohol, concentration, of, 0, 03, 0, 05, and, induces, anesthetic, coma, at, 0, 4, however, this, use, carried, the, high, risk, of, deadly, alcohol, intoxication, pulmonary, aspiration, and, vomit, which, led, to, use, of, alternatives, in, antiquity, such, as, opium, and, cannabis, and, later, diethyl, ether, starting, in, the, 1840s, ethanol, is, used, as, an, antiseptic, in, medical, wipes, and, hand, sanitizer, gels, for, its, bactericidal, and, anti, fungal, effects, ethanol, kills, microorganisms, by, dissolving, their, membrane, lipid, bilayer, and, denaturing, their, proteins, and, is, effective, against, most, bacteria, fungi, and, viruses, however, it, is, ineffective, against, bacterial, spores, which, can, be, treated, with, hydrogen, peroxide, a, solution, of, 70, ethanol, is, more, effective, than, pure, ethanol, because, ethanol, relies, on, water, molecules, for, optimal, antimicrobial, activity, absolute, ethanol, may, inactivate, microbes, without, destroying, them, because, the, alcohol, is, unable, to, fully, permeate, the, microbe, s, membrane, ethanol, can, also, be, used, as, a, disinfectant, and, antiseptic, by, inducing, cell, dehydration, through, disruption, of, the, osmotic, balance, across, the, cell, membrane, causing, water, to, leave, the, cell, leading, to, cell, death, ethanol, may, be, administered, as, an, antidote, to, ethylene, glycol, poisoning, and, methanol, poisoning, it, does, so, by, acting, as, a, competitive, inhibitor, against, methanol, and, ethylene, glycol, for, alcohol, dehydrogenase, though, it, has, more, side, effects, ethanol, is, less, expensive, and, more, readily, available, than, fomepizole, in, the, role, ethanol, is, used, to, dissolve, many, water, insoluble, medications, and, related, compounds, liquid, preparations, of, pain, medications, cough, and, cold, medicines, and, mouth, washes, for, example, may, contain, up, to, 25, ethanol, and, may, need, to, be, avoided, in, individuals, with, adverse, reactions, to, ethanol, such, as, alcohol, induced, respiratory, reactions, ethanol, is, present, mainly, as, an, antimicrobial, preservative, in, over, 700, liquid, preparations, of, medicine, including, acetaminophen, iron, supplements, ranitidine, furosemide, mannitol, phenobarbital, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and, over, the, counter, cough, medicine, some, medicinal, solutions, of, ethanol, are, also, known, as, tinctures, in, mammals, ethanol, is, primarily, metabolized, in, the, liver, and, stomach, by, alcohol, dehydrogenase, adh, enzymes, these, enzymes, catalyze, the, oxidation, of, ethanol, into, acetaldehyde, ethanal, when, present, in, significant, concentrations, this, metabolism, of, ethanol, is, additionally, aided, by, the, cytochrome, p450, enzyme, cyp2e1, in, humans, while, trace, amounts, are, also, metabolized, by, catalase, the, resulting, intermediate, acetaldehyde, is, a, known, carcinogen, and, poses, significantly, greater, toxicity, in, humans, than, ethanol, itself, many, of, the, symptoms, typically, associated, with, alcohol, intoxication, as, well, as, many, of, the, health, hazards, typically, associated, with, the, long, term, consumption, of, ethanol, can, be, attributed, to, acetaldehyde, toxicity, in, humans, the, subsequent, oxidation, of, acetaldehyde, into, acetate, is, performed, by, aldehyde, dehydrogenase, aldh, enzymes, a, mutation, in, the, aldh2, gene, that, encodes, for, an, inactive, or, dysfunctional, form, of, this, enzyme, affects, roughly, 50, of, east, asian, populations, contributing, to, the, characteristic, alcohol, flush, reaction, that, can, cause, temporary, reddening, of, the, skin, as, well, as, a, number, of, related, and, often, unpleasant, symptoms, of, acetaldehyde, toxicity, this, mutation, is, typically, accompanied, by, another, mutation, in, the, alcohol, dehydrogenase, enzyme, adh1b, in, roughly, 80, of, east, asians, which, improves, the, catalytic, efficiency, of, converting, ethanol, into, acetaldehyde, as, a, central, nervous, system, depressant, ethanol, is, one, of, the, most, commonly, consumed, psychoactive, drugs, despite, alcohol, s, psychoactive, addictive, and, carcinogenic, properties, it, is, readily, available, and, legal, for, sale, in, most, countries, there, are, laws, regulating, the, sale, exportation, importation, taxation, manufacturing, consumption, and, possession, of, alcoholic, beverages, the, most, common, regulation, is, prohibition, for, minors, the, largest, single, use, of, ethanol, is, as, an, engine, fuel, and, fuel, additive, brazil, in, particular, relies, heavily, upon, the, use, of, ethanol, as, an, engine, fuel, due, in, part, to, its, role, as, one, of, the, world, s, leading, producers, of, ethanol, gasoline, sold, in, brazil, contains, at, least, 25, anhydrous, ethanol, hydrous, ethanol, about, 95, ethanol, and, 5, water, can, be, used, as, fuel, in, more, than, 90, of, new, gasoline, fueled, cars, sold, in, the, country, the, us, and, many, other, countries, primarily, use, e10, 10, ethanol, sometimes, known, as, gasohol, and, e85, 85, ethanol, ethanol, gasoline, mixtures, over, time, it, is, believed, that, a, material, portion, of, the, 150, billion, us, gallon, 570, 000, 000, m, 3, per, year, market, for, gasoline, will, begin, to, be, replaced, with, fuel, ethanol, australian, law, limits, the, use, of, pure, ethanol, from, sugarcane, waste, to, 10, in, automobiles, older, cars, and, vintage, cars, designed, to, use, a, slower, burning, fuel, should, have, the, engine, valves, upgraded, or, replaced, according, to, an, industry, advocacy, group, ethanol, as, a, fuel, reduces, harmful, tailpipe, emissions, of, carbon, monoxide, particulate, matter, oxides, of, nitrogen, and, other, ozone, forming, pollutants, argonne, national, laboratory, analyzed, greenhouse, gas, emissions, of, many, different, engine, and, fuel, combinations, and, found, that, biodiesel, petrodiesel, blend, b20, showed, a, reduction, of, 8, conventional, e85, ethanol, blend, a, reduction, of, 17, and, cellulosic, ethanol, 64, compared, with, pure, gasoline, ethanol, has, a, much, greater, research, octane, number, ron, than, gasoline, meaning, it, is, less, prone, to, pre, ignition, allowing, for, better, ignition, advance, which, means, more, torque, and, efficiency, in, addition, to, the, lower, carbon, emissions, ethanol, combustion, in, an, internal, combustion, engine, yields, many, of, the, products, of, incomplete, combustion, produced, by, gasoline, and, significantly, larger, amounts, of, formaldehyde, and, related, species, such, as, acetaldehyde, this, leads, to, a, significantly, larger, photochemical, reactivity, and, more, ground, level, ozone, this, data, has, been, assembled, into, the, clean, fuels, report, comparison, of, fuel, emissions, and, show, that, ethanol, exhaust, generates, 2, 14, times, as, much, ozone, as, gasoline, exhaust, when, this, is, added, into, the, custom, localized, pollution, index, of, the, clean, fuels, report, the, local, pollution, of, ethanol, pollution, that, contributes, to, smog, is, rated, 1, 7, where, gasoline, is, 1, 0, and, higher, numbers, signify, greater, pollution, the, california, air, resources, board, formalized, this, issue, in, 2008, by, recognizing, control, standards, for, formaldehydes, as, an, emissions, control, group, much, like, the, conventional, nox, and, reactive, organic, gases, rogs, more, than, 20, of, brazilian, cars, are, able, to, use, 100, ethanol, as, fuel, which, includes, ethanol, only, engines, and, flex, fuel, engines, flex, fuel, engines, in, brazil, are, able, to, work, with, all, ethanol, all, gasoline, or, any, mixture, of, both, in, the, united, states, flex, fuel, vehicles, can, run, on, 0, to, 85, ethanol, 15, gasoline, since, higher, ethanol, blends, are, not, yet, allowed, or, efficient, brazil, supports, this, fleet, of, ethanol, burning, automobiles, with, large, national, infrastructure, that, produces, ethanol, from, domestically, grown, sugarcane, ethanol, s, high, miscibility, with, water, makes, it, unsuitable, for, shipping, through, modern, pipelines, like, liquid, hydrocarbons, mechanics, have, seen, increased, cases, of, damage, to, small, engines, in, particular, the, carburetor, and, attribute, the, damage, to, the, increased, water, retention, by, ethanol, in, fuel, ethanol, was, commonly, used, as, fuel, in, early, bipropellant, rocket, liquid, propelled, vehicles, in, conjunction, with, an, oxidizer, such, as, liquid, oxygen, the, german, a, 4, ballistic, rocket, of, world, war, ii, better, known, by, its, propaganda, name, v, 2, which, is, credited, as, having, begun, the, space, age, used, ethanol, as, the, main, constituent, of, b, stoff, under, such, nomenclature, the, ethanol, was, mixed, with, 25, water, to, reduce, the, combustion, chamber, temperature, the, v, 2, s, design, team, helped, develop, u, s, rockets, following, world, war, ii, including, the, ethanol, fueled, redstone, rocket, which, launched, the, first, u, s, astronaut, on, suborbital, spaceflight, alcohols, fell, into, general, disuse, as, more, energy, dense, rocket, fuels, were, developed, although, ethanol, is, currently, used, in, lightweight, rocket, powered, racing, aircraft, commercial, fuel, cells, operate, on, reformed, natural, gas, hydrogen, or, methanol, ethanol, is, an, attractive, alternative, due, to, its, wide, availability, low, cost, high, purity, and, low, toxicity, there, is, a, wide, range, of, fuel, cell, concepts, that, have, entered, trials, including, direct, ethanol, fuel, cells, auto, thermal, reforming, systems, and, thermally, integrated, systems, the, majority, of, work, is, being, conducted, at, a, research, level, although, there, are, a, number, of, organizations, at, the, beginning, of, the, commercialization, of, ethanol, fuel, cells, ethanol, fireplaces, can, be, used, for, home, heating, or, for, decoration, ethanol, can, also, be, used, as, stove, fuel, for, cooking, ethanol, is, an, important, industrial, ingredient, it, has, widespread, use, as, a, precursor, for, other, organic, compounds, such, as, ethyl, halides, ethyl, esters, diethyl, ether, acetic, acid, and, ethyl, amines, ethanol, is, considered, a, universal, solvent, as, its, molecular, structure, allows, for, the, dissolving, of, both, polar, hydrophilic, and, nonpolar, hydrophobic, compounds, as, ethanol, also, has, a, low, boiling, point, it, is, easy, to, remove, from, a, solution, that, has, been, used, to, dissolve, other, compounds, making, it, a, popular, extracting, agent, for, botanical, oils, cannabis, oil, extraction, methods, often, use, ethanol, as, an, extraction, solvent, and, also, as, a, post, processing, solvent, to, remove, oils, waxes, and, chlorophyll, from, solution, in, a, process, known, as, winterization, ethanol, is, found, in, paints, tinctures, markers, and, personal, care, products, such, as, mouthwashes, perfumes, and, deodorants, polysaccharides, precipitate, from, aqueous, solution, in, the, presence, of, alcohol, and, ethanol, precipitation, is, used, for, this, reason, in, the, purification, of, dna, and, rna, because, of, its, low, freezing, point, of, 114, c, 173, f, and, low, toxicity, ethanol, is, sometimes, used, in, laboratories, with, dry, ice, or, other, coolants, as, a, cooling, bath, to, keep, vessels, at, temperatures, below, the, freezing, point, of, water, for, the, same, reason, it, is, also, used, as, the, active, fluid, in, alcohol, thermometers, ethanol, is, a, 2, carbon, alcohol, its, molecular, formula, is, ch, 3, ch, 2, oh, the, structure, of, the, molecule, of, ethanol, is, ch, 3, ch, 2, oh, an, ethyl, group, linked, to, a, hydroxyl, group, which, indicates, that, the, carbon, of, a, methyl, group, ch, 3, is, attached, to, the, carbon, of, a, methylene, group, ch, 2, which, is, attached, to, the, oxygen, of, a, hydroxyl, group, oh, it, is, a, constitutional, isomer, of, dimethyl, ether, ethanol, is, sometimes, abbreviated, as, etoh, using, the, common, organic, chemistry, notation, of, representing, the, ethyl, group, c, 2, h, 5, with, et, ethanol, is, a, volatile, colorless, liquid, that, has, a, slight, odor, it, burns, with, a, smokeless, blue, flame, that, is, not, always, visible, in, normal, light, the, physical, properties, of, ethanol, stem, primarily, from, the, presence, of, its, hydroxyl, group, and, the, shortness, of, its, carbon, chain, ethanol, s, hydroxyl, group, is, able, to, participate, in, hydrogen, bonding, rendering, it, more, viscous, and, less, volatile, than, less, polar, organic, compounds, of, similar, molecular, weight, such, as, propane, ethanol, s, adiabatic, flame, temperature, for, combustion, in, air, is, 2082, c, or, 3779, f, ethanol, is, slightly, more, refractive, than, water, having, a, refractive, index, of, 1, 36242, at, 589, 3, nm, and, 18, 35, c, or, 65, 03, f, the, triple, point, for, ethanol, is, 150, 20, k, ethanol, is, a, versatile, solvent, miscible, with, water, and, with, many, organic, solvents, including, acetic, acid, acetone, benzene, carbon, tetrachloride, chloroform, diethyl, ether, ethylene, glycol, glycerol, nitromethane, pyridine, and, toluene, its, main, use, as, a, solvent, is, in, making, tincture, of, iodine, cough, syrups, etc, it, is, also, miscible, with, light, aliphatic, hydrocarbons, such, as, pentane, and, hexane, and, with, aliphatic, chlorides, such, as, trichloroethane, and, tetrachloroethylene, ethanol, s, miscibility, with, water, contrasts, with, the, immiscibility, of, longer, chain, alcohols, five, or, more, carbon, atoms, whose, water, miscibility, decreases, sharply, as, the, number, of, carbons, increases, the, miscibility, of, ethanol, with, alkanes, is, limited, to, alkanes, up, to, undecane, mixtures, with, dodecane, and, higher, alkanes, show, a, miscibility, gap, below, a, certain, temperature, about, 13, c, for, dodecane, the, miscibility, gap, tends, to, get, wider, with, higher, alkanes, and, the, temperature, for, complete, miscibility, increases, ethanol, water, mixtures, have, less, volume, than, the, sum, of, their, individual, components, at, the, given, fractions, mixing, equal, volumes, of, ethanol, and, water, results, in, only, 1, 92, volumes, of, mixture, mixing, ethanol, and, water, is, exothermic, with, up, to, 777, j, mol, being, released, at, 298, k, mixtures, of, ethanol, and, water, form, an, azeotrope, at, about, 89, mole, ethanol, and, 11, mole, water, or, a, mixture, of, 95, 6, ethanol, by, mass, or, about, 97, alcohol, by, volume, at, normal, pressure, which, boils, at, 351, k, 78, c, this, azeotropic, composition, is, strongly, temperature, and, pressure, dependent, and, vanishes, at, temperatures, below, 303, k, hydrogen, bonding, causes, pure, ethanol, to, be, hygroscopic, to, the, extent, that, it, readily, absorbs, water, from, the, air, the, polar, nature, of, the, hydroxyl, group, causes, ethanol, to, dissolve, many, ionic, compounds, notably, sodium, and, potassium, hydroxides, magnesium, chloride, calcium, chloride, ammonium, chloride, ammonium, bromide, and, sodium, bromide, sodium, and, potassium, chlorides, are, slightly, soluble, in, ethanol, because, the, ethanol, molecule, also, has, a, nonpolar, end, it, will, also, dissolve, nonpolar, substances, including, most, essential, oils, and, numerous, flavoring, coloring, and, medicinal, agents, the, addition, of, even, a, few, percent, of, ethanol, to, water, sharply, reduces, the, surface, tension, of, water, this, property, partially, explains, the, tears, of, wine, phenomenon, when, wine, is, swirled, in, a, glass, ethanol, evaporates, quickly, from, the, thin, film, of, wine, on, the, wall, of, the, glass, as, the, wine, s, ethanol, content, decreases, its, surface, tension, increases, and, the, thin, film, beads, up, and, runs, down, the, glass, in, channels, rather, than, as, a, smooth, sheet, an, ethanol, water, solution, will, catch, fire, if, heated, above, a, temperature, called, its, flash, point, and, an, ignition, source, is, then, applied, to, it, for, 20, alcohol, by, mass, about, 25, by, volume, this, will, occur, at, about, 25, c, 77, f, the, flash, point, of, pure, ethanol, is, 13, c, 55, f, but, may, be, influenced, very, slightly, by, atmospheric, composition, such, as, pressure, and, humidity, ethanol, mixtures, can, ignite, below, average, room, temperature, ethanol, is, considered, a, flammable, liquid, class, 3, hazardous, material, in, concentrations, above, 2, 35, by, mass, 3, 0, by, volume, 6, proof, dishes, using, burning, alcohol, for, culinary, effects, are, called, flamb, ethanol, is, a, byproduct, of, the, metabolic, process, of, yeast, as, such, ethanol, will, be, present, in, any, yeast, habitat, ethanol, can, commonly, be, found, in, overripe, fruit, ethanol, produced, by, symbiotic, yeast, can, be, found, in, bertam, palm, blossoms, although, some, animal, species, such, as, the, pentailed, treeshrew, exhibit, ethanol, seeking, behaviors, most, show, no, interest, or, avoidance, of, food, sources, containing, ethanol, ethanol, is, also, produced, during, the, germination, of, many, plants, as, a, result, of, natural, anaerobiosis, ethanol, has, been, detected, in, outer, space, forming, an, icy, coating, around, dust, grains, in, interstellar, clouds, minute, quantity, amounts, average, 196, ppb, of, endogenous, ethanol, and, acetaldehyde, were, found, in, the, exhaled, breath, of, healthy, volunteers, auto, brewery, syndrome, also, known, as, gut, fermentation, syndrome, is, a, rare, medical, condition, in, which, intoxicating, quantities, of, ethanol, are, produced, through, endogenous, fermentation, within, the, digestive, system, ethanol, is, produced, both, as, a, petrochemical, through, the, hydration, of, ethylene, and, via, biological, processes, by, fermenting, sugars, with, yeast, which, process, is, more, economical, depends, on, prevailing, prices, of, petroleum, and, grain, feed, stocks, world, production, of, ethanol, in, 2006, was, 51, gigalitres, 1, 3, 10, 10, us, gal, with, 69, of, the, world, supply, coming, from, brazil, and, the, u, s, brazilian, ethanol, is, produced, from, sugarcane, which, has, relatively, high, yields, 830, more, fuel, than, the, fossil, fuels, used, to, produce, it, compared, to, some, other, energy, crops, sugarcane, not, only, has, a, greater, concentration, of, sucrose, than, corn, by, about, 30, but, is, also, much, easier, to, extract, the, bagasse, generated, by, the, process, is, not, discarded, but, burned, by, power, plants, to, produce, electricity, bagasse, burning, accounts, for, around, 9, of, the, electricity, produced, in, brazil, in, the, 1970s, most, industrial, ethanol, in, the, u, s, was, made, as, a, petrochemical, but, in, the, 1980s, the, u, s, introduced, subsidies, for, corn, based, ethanol, according, to, the, renewable, fuels, association, as, of, 30, october, 2007, 131, grain, ethanol, bio, refineries, in, the, u, s, have, the, capacity, to, produce, 7, 10, 9, us, gal, 26, 000, 000, m, 3, of, ethanol, per, year, an, additional, 72, construction, projects, underway, in, the, u, s, can, add, 6, 4, billion, us, gallons, 24, 000, 000, m, 3, of, new, capacity, in, the, next, 18, months, in, india, ethanol, is, made, from, sugarcane, sweet, sorghum, is, another, potential, source, of, ethanol, and, is, suitable, for, growing, in, dryland, conditions, the, international, crops, research, institute, for, the, semi, arid, tropics, is, investigating, the, possibility, of, growing, sorghum, as, a, source, of, fuel, food, and, animal, feed, in, arid, parts, of, asia, and, africa, sweet, sorghum, has, one, third, the, water, requirement, of, sugarcane, over, the, same, time, period, it, also, requires, about, 22, less, water, than, corn, the, world, s, first, sweet, sorghum, ethanol, distillery, began, commercial, production, in, 2007, in, andhra, pradesh, india, ethanol, can, be, produced, from, petrochemical, feed, stocks, primarily, by, the, acid, catalyzed, hydration, of, ethylene, it, is, often, referred, to, as, synthetic, ethanol, the, catalyst, is, most, commonly, phosphoric, acid, adsorbed, onto, a, porous, support, such, as, silica, gel, or, diatomaceous, earth, this, catalyst, was, first, used, for, large, scale, ethanol, production, by, the, shell, oil, company, in, 1947, the, reaction, is, carried, out, in, the, presence, of, high, pressure, steam, at, 300, c, 572, f, where, a, 5, 3, ethylene, to, steam, ratio, is, maintained, this, process, was, used, on, an, industrial, scale, by, union, carbide, corporation, and, others, it, is, no, longer, practiced, in, the, us, as, fermentation, ethanol, produced, from, corn, is, more, economical, in, an, older, process, first, practiced, on, the, industrial, scale, in, 1930, by, union, carbide, but, now, almost, entirely, obsolete, ethylene, was, hydrated, indirectly, by, reacting, it, with, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, to, produce, ethyl, sulfate, which, was, hydrolyzed, to, yield, ethanol, and, regenerate, the, sulfuric, acid, ethanol, has, been, produced, in, the, laboratory, by, converting, carbon, dioxide, via, biological, and, electrochemical, reactions, ethanol, in, alcoholic, beverages, and, fuel, is, produced, by, fermentation, certain, species, of, yeast, e, g, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, metabolize, sugar, namely, polysaccharides, producing, ethanol, and, carbon, dioxide, the, chemical, equations, below, summarize, the, conversion, fermentation, is, the, process, of, culturing, yeast, under, favorable, thermal, conditions, to, produce, alcohol, this, process, is, carried, out, at, around, 35, 40, c, 95, 104, f, toxicity, of, ethanol, to, yeast, limits, the, ethanol, concentration, obtainable, by, brewing, higher, concentrations, therefore, are, obtained, by, fortification, or, distillation, the, most, ethanol, tolerant, yeast, strains, can, survive, up, to, approximately, 18, ethanol, by, volume, to, produce, ethanol, from, starchy, materials, such, as, cereals, the, starch, must, first, be, converted, into, sugars, in, brewing, beer, this, has, traditionally, been, accomplished, by, allowing, the, grain, to, germinate, or, malt, which, produces, the, enzyme, amylase, when, the, malted, grain, is, mashed, the, amylase, converts, the, remaining, starches, into, sugars, sugars, for, ethanol, fermentation, can, be, obtained, from, cellulose, deployment, of, this, technology, could, turn, a, number, of, cellulose, containing, agricultural, by, products, such, as, corncobs, straw, and, sawdust, into, renewable, energy, resources, other, agricultural, residues, such, as, sugarcane, bagasse, and, energy, crops, such, as, switchgrass, may, also, be, fermentable, sugar, sources, breweries, and, biofuel, plants, employ, two, methods, for, measuring, ethanol, concentration, infrared, ethanol, sensors, measure, the, vibrational, frequency, of, dissolved, ethanol, using, the, c, h, band, at, 2900, cm, 1, this, method, uses, a, relatively, inexpensive, solid, state, sensor, that, compares, the, c, h, band, with, a, reference, band, to, calculate, the, ethanol, content, the, calculation, makes, use, of, the, beer, lambert, law, alternatively, by, measuring, the, density, of, the, starting, material, and, the, density, of, the, product, using, a, hydrometer, the, change, in, specific, gravity, during, fermentation, indicates, the, alcohol, content, this, inexpensive, and, indirect, method, has, a, long, history, in, the, beer, brewing, industry, ethylene, hydration, or, brewing, produces, an, ethanol, water, mixture, for, most, industrial, and, fuel, uses, the, ethanol, must, be, purified, fractional, distillation, at, atmospheric, pressure, can, concentrate, ethanol, to, 95, 6, by, weight, 89, 5, mole, this, mixture, is, an, azeotrope, with, a, boiling, point, of, 78, 1, c, 172, 6, f, and, cannot, be, further, purified, by, distillation, addition, of, an, entraining, agent, such, as, benzene, cyclohexane, or, heptane, allows, a, new, ternary, azeotrope, comprising, the, ethanol, water, and, the, entraining, agent, to, be, formed, this, lower, boiling, ternary, azeotrope, is, removed, preferentially, leading, to, water, free, ethanol, apart, from, distillation, ethanol, may, be, dried, by, addition, of, a, desiccant, such, as, molecular, sieves, cellulose, or, cornmeal, the, desiccants, can, be, dried, and, reused, molecular, sieves, can, be, used, to, selectively, absorb, the, water, from, the, 95, 6, ethanol, solution, molecular, sieves, of, pore, size, 3, ngstrom, a, type, of, zeolite, effectively, sequester, water, molecules, while, excluding, ethanol, molecules, heating, the, wet, sieves, drives, out, the, water, allowing, regeneration, of, their, desiccant, capability, membranes, can, also, be, used, to, separate, ethanol, and, water, membrane, based, separations, are, not, subject, to, the, limitations, of, the, water, ethanol, azeotrope, because, the, separations, are, not, based, on, vapor, liquid, equilibria, membranes, are, often, used, in, the, so, called, hybrid, membrane, distillation, process, this, process, uses, a, pre, concentration, distillation, column, as, the, first, separating, step, the, further, separation, is, then, accomplished, with, a, membrane, operated, either, in, vapor, permeation, or, pervaporation, mode, vapor, permeation, uses, a, vapor, membrane, feed, and, pervaporation, uses, a, liquid, membrane, feed, a, variety, of, other, techniques, have, been, discussed, including, the, following, pure, ethanol, and, alcoholic, beverages, are, heavily, taxed, as, psychoactive, drugs, but, ethanol, has, many, uses, that, do, not, involve, its, consumption, to, relieve, the, tax, burden, on, these, uses, most, jurisdictions, waive, the, tax, when, an, agent, has, been, added, to, the, ethanol, to, render, it, unfit, to, drink, these, include, bittering, agents, such, as, denatonium, benzoate, and, toxins, such, as, methanol, naphtha, and, pyridine, products, of, this, kind, are, called, denatured, alcohol, absolute, or, anhydrous, alcohol, refers, to, ethanol, with, a, low, water, content, there, are, various, grades, with, maximum, water, contents, ranging, from, 1, to, a, few, parts, per, million, ppm, if, azeotropic, distillation, is, used, to, remove, water, it, will, contain, trace, amounts, of, the, material, separation, agent, e, g, benzene, absolute, alcohol, is, not, intended, for, human, consumption, absolute, ethanol, is, used, as, a, solvent, for, laboratory, and, industrial, applications, where, water, will, react, with, other, chemicals, and, as, fuel, alcohol, spectroscopic, ethanol, is, an, absolute, ethanol, with, a, low, absorbance, in, ultraviolet, and, visible, light, fit, for, use, as, a, solvent, in, ultraviolet, visible, spectroscopy, pure, ethanol, is, classed, as, 200, proof, in, the, us, equivalent, to, 175, degrees, proof, in, the, uk, system, rectified, spirit, an, azeotropic, composition, of, 96, ethanol, containing, 4, water, is, used, instead, of, anhydrous, ethanol, for, various, purposes, spirits, of, wine, are, about, 94, ethanol, 188, proof, the, impurities, are, different, from, those, in, 95, 190, proof, laboratory, ethanol, ethanol, is, classified, as, a, primary, alcohol, meaning, that, the, carbon, that, its, hydroxyl, group, attaches, to, has, at, least, two, hydrogen, atoms, attached, to, it, as, well, many, ethanol, reactions, occur, at, its, hydroxyl, group, in, the, presence, of, acid, catalysts, ethanol, reacts, with, carboxylic, acids, to, produce, ethyl, esters, and, water, this, reaction, which, is, conducted, on, large, scale, industrially, requires, the, removal, of, the, water, from, the, reaction, mixture, as, it, is, formed, esters, react, in, the, presence, of, an, acid, or, base, to, give, back, the, alcohol, and, a, salt, this, reaction, is, known, as, saponification, because, it, is, used, in, the, preparation, of, soap, ethanol, can, also, form, esters, with, inorganic, acids, diethyl, sulfate, and, triethyl, phosphate, are, prepared, by, treating, ethanol, with, sulfur, trioxide, and, phosphorus, pentoxide, respectively, diethyl, sulfate, is, a, useful, ethylating, agent, in, organic, synthesis, ethyl, nitrite, prepared, from, the, reaction, of, ethanol, with, sodium, nitrite, and, sulfuric, acid, was, formerly, used, as, a, diuretic, in, the, presence, of, acid, catalysts, alcohols, can, be, converted, to, alkenes, such, as, ethanol, to, ethylene, typically, solid, acids, such, as, alumina, are, used, since, water, is, removed, from, the, same, molecule, the, reaction, is, known, as, intramolecular, dehydration, intramolecular, dehydration, of, an, alcohol, requires, a, high, temperature, and, the, presence, of, an, acid, catalyst, such, as, sulfuric, acid, ethylene, produced, from, sugar, derived, ethanol, primarily, in, brazil, competes, with, ethylene, produced, from, petrochemical, feedstocks, such, as, naphtha, and, ethane, at, a, lower, temperature, than, that, of, intramolecular, dehydration, intermolecular, alcohol, dehydration, may, occur, producing, a, symmetrical, ether, this, is, a, condensation, reaction, in, the, following, example, diethyl, ether, is, produced, from, ethanol, complete, combustion, of, ethanol, forms, carbon, dioxide, and, water, specific, heat, 2, 44, kj, kg, k, ethanol, is, a, neutral, molecule, and, the, ph, of, a, solution, of, ethanol, in, water, is, nearly, 7, 00, ethanol, can, be, quantitatively, converted, to, its, conjugate, base, the, ethoxide, ion, ch, 3, ch, 2, o, by, reaction, with, an, alkali, metal, such, as, sodium, or, a, very, strong, base, such, as, sodium, hydride, the, acidities, of, water, and, ethanol, are, nearly, the, same, as, indicated, by, their, pka, of, 15, 7, and, 16, respectively, thus, sodium, ethoxide, and, sodium, hydroxide, exist, in, an, equilibrium, that, is, closely, balanced, ethanol, is, not, used, industrially, as, a, precursor, to, ethyl, halides, but, the, reactions, are, illustrative, ethanol, reacts, with, hydrogen, halides, to, produce, ethyl, halides, such, as, ethyl, chloride, and, ethyl, bromide, via, an, s, n, 2, reaction, hcl, requires, a, catalyst, such, as, zinc, chloride, hbr, requires, refluxing, with, a, sulfuric, acid, catalyst, ethyl, halides, can, in, principle, also, be, produced, by, treating, ethanol, with, more, specialized, halogenating, agents, such, as, thionyl, chloride, or, phosphorus, tribromide, upon, treatment, with, halogens, in, the, presence, of, base, ethanol, gives, the, corresponding, haloform, chx, 3, where, x, cl, br, i, this, conversion, is, called, the, haloform, reaction, an, intermediate, in, the, reaction, with, chlorine, is, the, aldehyde, called, chloral, which, forms, chloral, hydrate, upon, reaction, with, water, ethanol, can, be, oxidized, to, acetaldehyde, and, further, oxidized, to, acetic, acid, depending, on, the, reagents, and, conditions, this, oxidation, is, of, no, importance, industrially, but, in, the, human, body, these, oxidation, reactions, are, catalyzed, by, the, enzyme, liver, alcohol, dehydrogenase, the, oxidation, product, of, ethanol, acetic, acid, is, a, nutrient, for, humans, being, a, precursor, to, acetyl, coa, where, the, acetyl, group, can, be, spent, as, energy, or, used, for, biosynthesis, ethanol, is, similar, to, macronutrients, such, as, proteins, fats, and, carbohydrates, in, that, it, provides, calories, when, consumed, and, metabolized, it, contributes, 7, kilocalories, per, gram, via, ethanol, metabolism, ethanol, is, very, flammable, and, should, not, be, used, around, an, open, flame, pure, ethanol, will, irritate, the, skin, and, eyes, nausea, vomiting, and, intoxication, are, symptoms, of, ingestion, long, term, use, by, ingestion, can, result, in, serious, liver, damage, atmospheric, concentrations, above, one, part, per, thousand, are, above, the, european, union, occupational, exposure, limits, the, fermentation, of, sugar, into, ethanol, is, one, of, the, earliest, biotechnologies, employed, by, humans, ethanol, has, historically, been, identified, variously, as, spirit, of, wine, or, ardent, spirits, and, as, aqua, vitae, or, aqua, vita, the, intoxicating, effects, of, its, consumption, have, been, known, since, ancient, times, ethanol, has, been, used, by, humans, since, prehistory, as, the, intoxicating, ingredient, of, alcoholic, beverages, dried, residue, on, 9, 000, year, old, pottery, found, in, china, suggests, that, neolithic, people, consumed, alcoholic, beverages, the, inflammable, nature, of, the, exhalations, of, wine, was, already, known, to, ancient, natural, philosophers, such, as, aristotle, 384, 322, bce, theophrastus, c, 371, 287, bce, and, pliny, the, elder, 23, 24, 79, ce, however, this, did, not, immediately, lead, to, the, isolation, of, ethanol, despite, the, development, of, more, advanced, distillation, techniques, in, second, and, third, century, roman, egypt, an, important, recognition, first, found, in, one, of, the, writings, attributed, to, j, bir, ibn, ayy, n, ninth, century, ce, was, that, by, adding, salt, to, boiling, wine, which, increases, the, wine, s, relative, volatility, the, flammability, of, the, resulting, vapors, may, be, enhanced, the, distillation, of, wine, is, attested, in, arabic, works, attributed, to, al, kind, c, 801, 873, ce, and, to, al, f, r, b, c, 872, 950, and, in, the, 28th, book, of, al, zahr, w, s, latin, abulcasis, 936, 1013, kit, b, al, ta, r, f, later, translated, into, latin, as, liber, servatoris, in, the, twelfth, century, recipes, for, the, production, of, aqua, ardens, burning, water, i, e, ethanol, by, distilling, wine, with, salt, started, to, appear, in, a, number, of, latin, works, and, by, the, end, of, the, thirteenth, century, it, had, become, a, widely, known, substance, among, western, european, chemists, the, works, of, taddeo, alderotti, 1223, 1296, describe, a, method, for, concentrating, ethanol, involving, repeated, fractional, distillation, through, a, water, cooled, still, by, which, an, ethanol, purity, of, 90, could, be, obtained, the, medicinal, properties, of, ethanol, were, studied, by, arnald, of, villanova, 1240, 1311, ce, and, john, of, rupescissa, c, 1310, 1366, the, latter, of, whom, regarded, it, as, a, life, preserving, substance, able, to, prevent, all, diseases, the, aqua, vitae, or, water, of, life, also, called, by, john, the, quintessence, of, wine, in, china, archaeological, evidence, indicates, that, the, true, distillation, of, alcohol, began, during, the, jin, 1115, 1234, or, southern, song, 1127, 1279, dynasties, a, still, has, been, found, at, an, archaeological, site, in, qinglong, hebei, dating, to, the, 12th, century, in, india, the, true, distillation, of, alcohol, was, introduced, from, the, middle, east, and, was, in, wide, use, in, the, delhi, sultanate, by, the, 14th, century, in, 1796, german, russian, chemist, johann, tobias, lowitz, obtained, pure, ethanol, by, mixing, partially, purified, ethanol, the, alcohol, water, azeotrope, with, an, excess, of, anhydrous, alkali, and, then, distilling, the, mixture, over, low, heat, french, chemist, antoine, lavoisier, described, ethanol, as, a, compound, of, carbon, hydrogen, and, oxygen, and, in, 1807, nicolas, th, odore, de, saussure, determined, ethanol, s, chemical, formula, fifty, years, later, archibald, scott, couper, published, the, structural, formula, of, ethanol, one, of, the, first, structural, formulas, determined, ethanol, was, first, prepared, synthetically, in, 1825, by, michael, faraday, he, found, that, sulfuric, acid, could, absorb, large, volumes, of, coal, gas, he, gave, the, resulting, solution, to, henry, hennell, a, british, chemist, who, found, in, 1826, that, it, contained, sulphovinic, acid, ethyl, hydrogen, sulfate, in, 1828, hennell, and, the, french, chemist, georges, simon, serullas, independently, discovered, that, sulphovinic, acid, could, be, decomposed, into, ethanol, thus, in, 1825, faraday, had, unwittingly, discovered, that, ethanol, could, be, produced, from, ethylene, a, component, of, coal, gas, by, acid, catalyzed, hydration, a, process, similar, to, current, industrial, ethanol, synthesis, ethanol, was, used, as, lamp, fuel, in, the, u, s, as, early, as, 1840, but, a, tax, levied, on, industrial, alcohol, during, the, civil, war, made, this, use, uneconomical, the, tax, was, repealed, in, 1906, use, as, an, automotive, fuel, dates, back, to, 1908, with, the, ford, model, t, able, to, run, on, petrol, gasoline, or, ethanol, it, fuels, some, spirit, lamps, ethanol, intended, for, industrial, use, is, often, produced, from, ethylene, ethanol, has, widespread, use, as, a, solvent, of, substances, intended, for, human, contact, or, consumption, including, scents, flavorings, colorings, and, medicines, in, chemistry, it, is, both, a, solvent, and, a, feedstock, for, the, synthesis, of, other, products, it, has, a, long, history, as, a, fuel, for, heat, and, light, and, more, recently, as, a, fuel, for, internal, combustion, engines
