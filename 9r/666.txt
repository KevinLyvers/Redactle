a, polder, dutch, pronunciation, is, a, low, lying, tract, of, land, that, forms, an, artificial, hydrological, entity, enclosed, by, embankments, known, as, dikes, the, three, types, of, polder, are, the, ground, level, in, drained, marshes, subsides, over, time, all, polders, will, eventually, be, below, the, surrounding, water, level, some, or, all, of, the, time, water, enters, the, low, lying, polder, through, infiltration, and, water, pressure, of, groundwater, or, rainfall, or, transport, of, water, by, rivers, and, canals, this, usually, means, that, the, polder, has, an, excess, of, water, which, is, pumped, out, or, drained, by, opening, sluices, at, low, tide, care, must, be, taken, not, to, set, the, internal, water, level, too, low, polder, land, made, up, of, peat, former, marshland, will, sink, in, relation, to, its, previous, level, because, of, peat, decomposing, when, exposed, to, oxygen, from, the, air, polders, are, at, risk, of, flooding, at, all, times, and, care, must, be, taken, to, protect, the, surrounding, dikes, dikes, are, typically, built, with, locally, available, materials, and, each, material, has, its, own, risks, sand, is, prone, to, collapse, owing, to, saturation, by, water, dry, peat, is, lighter, than, water, and, potentially, unable, to, retain, water, in, very, dry, seasons, some, animals, dig, tunnels, in, the, barrier, allowing, water, to, infiltrate, the, structure, the, muskrat, is, known, for, this, activity, and, hunted, in, certain, european, countries, because, of, it, polders, are, most, commonly, though, not, exclusively, found, in, river, deltas, former, fenlands, and, coastal, areas, flooding, of, polders, has, also, been, used, as, a, military, tactic, in, the, past, one, example, is, the, flooding, of, the, polders, along, the, yser, river, during, world, war, i, opening, the, sluices, at, high, tide, and, closing, them, at, low, tide, turned, the, polders, into, an, inaccessible, swamp, which, allowed, the, allied, armies, to, stop, the, german, army, the, netherlands, has, a, large, area, of, polders, as, much, as, 20, of, the, land, area, has, at, some, point, in, the, past, been, reclaimed, from, the, sea, thus, contributing, to, the, development, of, the, country, ijsselmeer, is, the, most, famous, polder, project, of, the, netherlands, some, other, countries, which, have, polders, are, bangladesh, belgium, canada, and, china, some, examples, of, dutch, polder, projects, are, beemster, schermer, flevopolder, and, noordoostpolder, the, dutch, word, polder, derives, successively, from, middle, dutch, polre, from, old, dutch, polra, and, ultimately, from, pol, a, piece, of, land, elevated, above, its, surroundings, with, the, augmentative, suffix, er, and, epenthetical, d, the, word, has, been, adopted, in, thirty, six, languages, the, netherlands, is, frequently, associated, with, polders, as, its, engineers, became, noted, for, developing, techniques, to, drain, wetlands, and, make, them, usable, for, agriculture, and, other, development, this, is, illustrated, by, the, saying, god, created, the, world, but, the, dutch, created, the, netherlands, the, dutch, have, a, long, history, of, reclamation, of, marshes, and, fenland, resulting, in, some, 3, 000, polders, nationwide, by, 1961, about, half, of, the, country, s, land, 18, 000, square, kilometres, 6, 800, sq, mi, was, reclaimed, from, the, sea, about, half, the, total, surface, area, of, polders, in, northwest, europe, is, in, the, netherlands, the, first, embankments, in, europe, were, constructed, in, roman, times, the, first, polders, were, constructed, in, the, 11th, century, the, oldest, extant, polder, is, the, achtermeer, polder, from, 1533, as, a, result, of, flooding, disasters, water, boards, called, waterschap, when, situated, more, inland, or, hoogheemraadschap, near, the, sea, mainly, used, in, the, holland, region, were, set, up, to, maintain, the, integrity, of, the, water, defences, around, polders, maintain, the, waterways, inside, a, polder, and, control, the, various, water, levels, inside, and, outside, the, polder, water, boards, hold, separate, elections, levy, taxes, and, function, independently, from, other, government, bodies, their, function, is, basically, unchanged, even, today, as, such, they, are, the, oldest, democratic, institutions, in, the, country, the, necessary, cooperation, among, all, ranks, to, maintain, polder, integrity, gave, its, name, to, the, dutch, version, of, third, way, politics, the, polder, model, the, 1953, flood, disaster, prompted, a, new, approach, to, the, design, of, dikes, and, other, water, retaining, structures, based, on, an, acceptable, probability, of, overflowing, risk, is, defined, as, the, product, of, probability, and, consequences, the, potential, damage, in, lives, property, and, rebuilding, costs, is, compared, with, the, potential, cost, of, water, defences, from, these, calculations, follows, an, acceptable, flood, risk, from, the, sea, at, one, in, 4, 000, 10, 000, years, while, it, is, one, in, 100, 2, 500, years, for, a, river, flood, the, particular, established, policy, guides, the, dutch, government, to, improve, flood, defences, as, new, data, on, threat, levels, become, available, major, dutch, polders, and, the, years, they, were, laid, dry, include, beemster, 1609, 1612, schermer, 1633, 1635, and, haarlemmermeerpolder, 1852, polders, created, as, part, of, the, zuiderzee, works, include, wieringermeerpolder, 1930, noordoostpolder, 1942, and, flevopolder, 1956, 1968, several, cities, on, the, para, ba, valley, region, in, the, s, o, paulo, state, have, polders, on, land, claimed, from, the, floodplains, around, the, para, ba, do, sul, river, bangladesh, has, 139, polders, of, which, 49, are, sea, facing, while, the, rest, are, along, the, numerous, distributaries, of, the, ganges, brahmaputra, meghna, river, delta, these, were, constructed, in, the, 1960s, to, protect, the, coast, from, tidal, flooding, and, reduce, salinity, incursion, they, reduce, long, term, flooding, and, waterlogging, following, storm, surges, from, tropical, cyclones, they, are, also, cultivated, for, agriculture, the, jiangnan, region, at, the, yangtze, river, delta, has, a, long, history, of, constructing, polders, most, of, these, projects, were, performed, between, the, 10th, and, 13th, centuries, the, chinese, government, also, assisted, local, communities, in, constructing, dikes, for, swampland, water, drainage, the, lijia, self, monitoring, system, of, 110, households, under, a, lizhang, headman, was, used, for, the, purposes, of, service, administration, and, tax, collection, in, the, polder, with, a, liangzhang, grain, chief, responsible, for, maintaining, the, water, system, and, a, tangzhang, dike, chief, for, polder, maintenance, in, germany, land, reclaimed, by, diking, is, called, a, koog, the, german, deichgraf, system, was, similar, to, the, dutch, and, is, widely, known, from, theodor, storm, s, novella, the, rider, on, the, white, horse, in, southern, germany, the, term, polder, is, used, for, retention, basins, recreated, by, opening, dikes, during, river, floodplain, restoration, a, meaning, somewhat, opposite, to, that, in, coastal, context
