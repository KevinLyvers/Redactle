lightning, is, a, natural, phenomenon, formed, by, electrostatic, discharges, through, the, atmosphere, between, two, electrically, charged, regions, either, both, in, the, atmosphere, or, one, in, the, atmosphere, and, one, on, the, ground, temporarily, neutralizing, these, in, a, near, instantaneous, release, of, an, average, of, between, 200, megajoules, and, 7, gigajoules, of, energy, depending, on, the, type, this, discharge, may, produce, a, wide, range, of, electromagnetic, radiation, from, heat, created, by, the, rapid, movement, of, electrons, to, brilliant, flashes, of, visible, light, in, the, form, of, black, body, radiation, lightning, causes, thunder, a, sound, from, the, shock, wave, which, develops, as, gases, in, the, vicinity, of, the, discharge, experience, a, sudden, increase, in, pressure, lightning, occurs, commonly, during, thunderstorms, as, well, as, other, types, of, energetic, weather, systems, but, volcanic, lightning, can, also, occur, during, volcanic, eruptions, lightning, is, an, atmospheric, electrical, phenomenon, and, contributes, to, the, global, atmospheric, electrical, circuit, the, three, main, kinds, of, lightning, are, distinguished, by, where, they, occur, either, inside, a, single, thundercloud, intra, cloud, between, two, clouds, cloud, to, cloud, or, between, a, cloud, and, the, ground, cloud, to, ground, in, which, case, it, is, referred, to, as, a, lightning, strike, many, other, observational, variants, are, recognized, including, heat, lightning, which, can, be, seen, from, a, great, distance, but, not, heard, dry, lightning, which, can, cause, forest, fires, and, ball, lightning, which, is, rarely, observed, scientifically, humans, have, deified, lightning, for, millennia, idiomatic, expressions, derived, from, lightning, such, as, the, english, expression, bolt, from, the, blue, are, common, across, languages, at, all, times, people, have, been, fascinated, by, the, sight, and, difference, of, lightning, the, fear, of, lightning, is, called, astraphobia, the, first, known, photograph, of, lightning, is, from, 1847, by, thomas, martin, easterly, the, first, surviving, photograph, is, from, 1882, by, william, nicholson, jennings, a, photographer, who, spent, half, his, life, capturing, pictures, of, lightning, and, proving, its, diversity, there, is, growing, evidence, that, lightning, activity, is, increased, by, particulate, emissions, a, form, of, air, pollution, however, lightning, may, also, improve, air, quality, and, clean, greenhouse, gases, such, as, methane, from, the, atmosphere, while, creating, nitrogen, oxide, and, ozone, at, the, same, time, lightning, is, also, the, major, cause, of, wildfire, and, wildfire, can, contribute, to, climate, change, as, well, more, studies, are, warranted, to, clarify, their, relationship, the, details, of, the, charging, process, are, still, being, studied, by, scientists, but, there, is, general, agreement, on, some, of, the, basic, concepts, of, thunderstorm, electrification, electrification, can, be, by, the, triboelectric, effect, leading, to, electron, or, ion, transfer, between, colliding, bodies, uncharged, colliding, water, drops, can, become, charged, because, of, charge, transfer, between, them, as, aqueous, ions, in, an, electric, field, as, would, exist, in, a, thunder, cloud, the, main, charging, area, in, a, thunderstorm, occurs, in, the, central, part, of, the, storm, where, air, is, moving, upward, rapidly, updraft, and, temperatures, range, from, 15, to, 25, c, 5, to, 13, f, see, figure, 1, in, that, area, the, combination, of, temperature, and, rapid, upward, air, movement, produces, a, mixture, of, super, cooled, cloud, droplets, small, water, droplets, below, freezing, small, ice, crystals, and, graupel, soft, hail, the, updraft, carries, the, super, cooled, cloud, droplets, and, very, small, ice, crystals, upward, at, the, same, time, the, graupel, which, is, considerably, larger, and, denser, tends, to, fall, or, be, suspended, in, the, rising, air, the, differences, in, the, movement, of, the, precipitation, cause, collisions, to, occur, when, the, rising, ice, crystals, collide, with, graupel, the, ice, crystals, become, positively, charged, and, the, graupel, becomes, negatively, charged, see, figure, 2, the, updraft, carries, the, positively, charged, ice, crystals, upward, toward, the, top, of, the, storm, cloud, the, larger, and, denser, graupel, is, either, suspended, in, the, middle, of, the, thunderstorm, cloud, or, falls, toward, the, lower, part, of, the, storm, the, result, is, that, the, upper, part, of, the, thunderstorm, cloud, becomes, positively, charged, while, the, middle, to, lower, part, of, the, thunderstorm, cloud, becomes, negatively, charged, the, upward, motions, within, the, storm, and, winds, at, higher, levels, in, the, atmosphere, tend, to, cause, the, small, ice, crystals, and, positive, charge, in, the, upper, part, of, the, thunderstorm, cloud, to, spread, out, horizontally, some, distance, from, the, thunderstorm, cloud, base, this, part, of, the, thunderstorm, cloud, is, called, the, anvil, while, this, is, the, main, charging, process, for, the, thunderstorm, cloud, some, of, these, charges, can, be, redistributed, by, air, movements, within, the, storm, updrafts, and, downdrafts, in, addition, there, is, a, small, but, important, positive, charge, buildup, near, the, bottom, of, the, thunderstorm, cloud, due, to, the, precipitation, and, warmer, temperatures, the, induced, separation, of, charge, in, pure, liquid, water, has, been, known, since, the, 1840s, as, has, the, electrification, of, pure, liquid, water, by, the, triboelectric, effect, william, thomson, lord, kelvin, demonstrated, that, charge, separation, in, water, occurs, in, the, usual, electric, fields, at, the, earth, s, surface, and, developed, a, continuous, electric, field, measuring, device, using, that, knowledge, the, physical, separation, of, charge, into, different, regions, using, liquid, water, was, demonstrated, by, kelvin, with, the, kelvin, water, dropper, the, most, likely, charge, carrying, species, were, considered, to, be, the, aqueous, hydrogen, ion, and, the, aqueous, hydroxide, ion, the, electrical, charging, of, solid, water, ice, has, also, been, considered, the, charged, species, were, again, considered, to, be, the, hydrogen, ion, and, the, hydroxide, ion, an, electron, is, not, stable, in, liquid, water, with, respect, to, a, hydroxide, ion, plus, dissolved, hydrogen, for, the, time, scales, involved, in, thunder, storms, the, charge, carrier, in, lightning, is, mainly, electrons, in, a, plasma, the, process, of, going, from, charge, as, ions, positive, hydrogen, ion, and, negative, hydroxide, ion, associated, with, liquid, water, or, solid, water, to, charge, as, electrons, associated, with, lightning, must, involve, some, form, of, electro, chemistry, that, is, the, oxidation, and, or, the, reduction, of, chemical, species, as, hydroxide, functions, as, a, base, and, carbon, dioxide, is, an, acidic, gas, it, is, possible, that, charged, water, clouds, in, which, the, negative, charge, is, in, the, form, of, the, aqueous, hydroxide, ion, interact, with, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, to, form, aqueous, carbonate, ions, and, aqueous, hydrogen, carbonate, ions, the, typical, cloud, to, ground, lightning, flash, culminates, in, the, formation, of, an, electrically, conducting, plasma, channel, through, the, air, in, excess, of, 5, km, 3, 1, mi, tall, from, within, the, cloud, to, the, ground, s, surface, the, actual, discharge, is, the, final, stage, of, a, very, complex, process, at, its, peak, a, typical, thunderstorm, produces, three, or, more, strikes, to, the, earth, per, minute, lightning, primarily, occurs, when, warm, air, is, mixed, with, colder, air, masses, resulting, in, atmospheric, disturbances, necessary, for, polarizing, the, atmosphere, lightning, can, also, occur, during, dust, storms, forest, fires, tornadoes, volcanic, eruptions, and, even, in, the, cold, of, winter, where, the, lightning, is, known, as, thundersnow, hurricanes, typically, generate, some, lightning, mainly, in, the, rainbands, as, much, as, 160, km, 99, mi, from, the, center, lightning, is, not, distributed, evenly, around, earth, on, earth, the, lightning, frequency, is, approximately, 44, 5, times, per, second, or, nearly, 1, 4, billion, flashes, per, year, and, the, median, duration, is, 0, 52, seconds, made, up, from, a, number, of, much, shorter, flashes, strokes, of, around, 60, to, 70, microseconds, many, factors, affect, the, frequency, distribution, strength, and, physical, properties, of, a, typical, lightning, flash, in, a, particular, region, of, the, world, these, factors, include, ground, elevation, latitude, prevailing, wind, currents, relative, humidity, and, proximity, to, warm, and, cold, bodies, of, water, to, a, certain, degree, the, proportions, of, intra, cloud, cloud, to, cloud, and, cloud, to, ground, lightning, may, also, vary, by, season, in, middle, latitudes, because, human, beings, are, terrestrial, and, most, of, their, possessions, are, on, the, earth, where, lightning, can, damage, or, destroy, them, cloud, to, ground, cg, lightning, is, the, most, studied, and, best, understood, of, the, three, types, even, though, in, cloud, ic, and, cloud, to, cloud, cc, are, more, common, types, of, lightning, lightning, s, relative, unpredictability, limits, a, complete, explanation, of, how, or, why, it, occurs, even, after, hundreds, of, years, of, scientific, investigation, about, 70, of, lightning, occurs, over, land, in, the, tropics, where, atmospheric, convection, is, the, greatest, this, occurs, from, both, the, mixture, of, warmer, and, colder, air, masses, as, well, as, differences, in, moisture, concentrations, and, it, generally, happens, at, the, boundaries, between, them, the, flow, of, warm, ocean, currents, past, drier, land, masses, such, as, the, gulf, stream, partially, explains, the, elevated, frequency, of, lightning, in, the, southeast, united, states, because, large, bodies, of, water, lack, the, topographic, variation, that, would, result, in, atmospheric, mixing, lightning, is, notably, less, frequent, over, the, world, s, oceans, than, over, land, the, north, and, south, poles, are, limited, in, their, coverage, of, thunderstorms, and, therefore, result, in, areas, with, the, least, lightning, in, general, cg, lightning, flashes, account, for, only, 25, of, all, total, lightning, flashes, worldwide, since, the, base, of, a, thunderstorm, is, usually, negatively, charged, this, is, where, most, cg, lightning, originates, this, region, is, typically, at, the, elevation, where, freezing, occurs, within, the, cloud, freezing, combined, with, collisions, between, ice, and, water, appears, to, be, a, critical, part, of, the, initial, charge, development, and, separation, process, during, wind, driven, collisions, ice, crystals, tend, to, develop, a, positive, charge, while, a, heavier, slushy, mixture, of, ice, and, water, called, graupel, develops, a, negative, charge, updrafts, within, a, storm, cloud, separate, the, lighter, ice, crystals, from, the, heavier, graupel, causing, the, top, region, of, the, cloud, to, accumulate, a, positive, space, charge, while, the, lower, level, accumulates, a, negative, space, charge, because, the, concentrated, charge, within, the, cloud, must, exceed, the, insulating, properties, of, air, and, this, increases, proportionally, to, the, distance, between, the, cloud, and, the, ground, the, proportion, of, cg, strikes, versus, cc, or, ic, discharges, becomes, greater, when, the, cloud, is, closer, to, the, ground, in, the, tropics, where, the, freezing, level, is, generally, higher, in, the, atmosphere, only, 10, of, lightning, flashes, are, cg, at, the, latitude, of, norway, around, 60, north, latitude, where, the, freezing, elevation, is, lower, 50, of, lightning, is, cg, lightning, is, usually, produced, by, cumulonimbus, clouds, which, have, bases, that, are, typically, 1, 2, km, 0, 62, 1, 24, mi, above, the, ground, and, tops, up, to, 15, km, 9, 3, mi, in, height, the, place, on, earth, where, lightning, occurs, most, often, is, over, lake, maracaibo, wherein, the, catatumbo, lightning, phenomenon, produces, 250, bolts, of, lightning, a, day, this, activity, occurs, on, average, 297, days, a, year, the, second, most, lightning, density, is, near, the, village, of, kifuka, in, the, mountains, of, the, eastern, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, where, the, elevation, is, around, 975, m, 3, 200, ft, on, average, this, region, receives, 158, lightning, strikes, per, square, kilometre, per, year, 410, sq, mi, yr, other, lightning, hotspots, include, singapore, and, lightning, alley, in, central, florida, according, to, the, world, meteorological, organization, on, april, 29, 2020, a, bolt, 768, km, 477, 2, mi, long, was, observed, in, the, southern, u, s, sixty, km, 37, mi, longer, than, the, previous, distance, record, southern, brazil, october, 31, 2018, a, single, flash, in, uruguay, and, northern, argentina, on, june, 18, 2020, lasted, for, 17, 1, seconds, 0, 37, seconds, longer, than, the, previous, record, march, 4, 2019, also, in, northern, argentina, in, order, for, an, electrostatic, discharge, to, occur, two, preconditions, are, necessary, first, a, sufficiently, high, potential, difference, between, two, regions, of, space, must, exist, and, second, a, high, resistance, medium, must, obstruct, the, free, unimpeded, equalization, of, the, opposite, charges, the, atmosphere, provides, the, electrical, insulation, or, barrier, that, prevents, free, equalization, between, charged, regions, of, opposite, polarity, it, is, well, understood, that, during, a, thunderstorm, there, is, charge, separation, and, aggregation, in, certain, regions, of, the, cloud, however, the, exact, processes, by, which, this, occurs, are, not, fully, understood, as, a, thundercloud, moves, over, the, surface, of, the, earth, an, equal, electric, charge, but, of, opposite, polarity, is, induced, on, the, earth, s, surface, underneath, the, cloud, the, induced, positive, surface, charge, when, measured, against, a, fixed, point, will, be, small, as, the, thundercloud, approaches, increasing, as, the, center, of, the, storm, arrives, and, dropping, as, the, thundercloud, passes, the, referential, value, of, the, induced, surface, charge, could, be, roughly, represented, as, a, bell, curve, the, oppositely, charged, regions, create, an, electric, field, within, the, air, between, them, this, electric, field, varies, in, relation, to, the, strength, of, the, surface, charge, on, the, base, of, the, thundercloud, the, greater, the, accumulated, charge, the, higher, the, electrical, field, the, best, studied, and, understood, form, of, lightning, is, cloud, to, ground, cg, lightning, although, more, common, intra, cloud, ic, and, cloud, to, cloud, cc, flashes, are, very, difficult, to, study, given, there, are, no, physical, points, to, monitor, inside, the, clouds, also, given, the, very, low, probability, of, lightning, striking, the, same, point, repeatedly, and, consistently, scientific, inquiry, is, difficult, even, in, areas, of, high, cg, frequency, in, a, process, not, well, understood, a, bidirectional, channel, of, ionized, air, called, a, leader, is, initiated, between, oppositely, charged, regions, in, a, thundercloud, leaders, are, electrically, conductive, channels, of, ionized, gas, that, propagate, through, or, are, otherwise, attracted, to, regions, with, a, charge, opposite, of, that, of, the, leader, tip, the, negative, end, of, the, bidirectional, leader, fills, a, positive, charge, region, also, called, a, well, inside, the, cloud, while, the, positive, end, fills, a, negative, charge, well, leaders, often, split, forming, branches, in, a, tree, like, pattern, in, addition, negative, and, some, positive, leaders, travel, in, a, discontinuous, fashion, in, a, process, called, stepping, the, resulting, jerky, movement, of, the, leaders, can, be, readily, observed, in, slow, motion, videos, of, lightning, flashes, it, is, possible, for, one, end, of, the, leader, to, fill, the, oppositely, charged, well, entirely, while, the, other, end, is, still, active, when, this, happens, the, leader, end, which, filled, the, well, may, propagate, outside, of, the, thundercloud, and, result, in, either, a, cloud, to, air, flash, or, a, cloud, to, ground, flash, in, a, typical, cloud, to, ground, flash, a, bidirectional, leader, initiates, between, the, main, negative, and, lower, positive, charge, regions, in, a, thundercloud, the, weaker, positive, charge, region, is, filled, quickly, by, the, negative, leader, which, then, propagates, toward, the, inductively, charged, ground, the, positively, and, negatively, charged, leaders, proceed, in, opposite, directions, positive, upwards, within, the, cloud, and, negative, towards, the, earth, both, ionic, channels, proceed, in, their, respective, directions, in, a, number, of, successive, spurts, each, leader, pools, ions, at, the, leading, tips, shooting, out, one, or, more, new, leaders, momentarily, pooling, again, to, concentrate, charged, ions, then, shooting, out, another, leader, the, negative, leader, continues, to, propagate, and, split, as, it, heads, downward, often, speeding, up, as, it, gets, closer, to, the, earth, s, surface, about, 90, of, ionic, channel, lengths, between, pools, are, approximately, 45, m, 148, ft, in, length, the, establishment, of, the, ionic, channel, takes, a, comparatively, long, amount, of, time, hundreds, of, milliseconds, in, comparison, to, the, resulting, discharge, which, occurs, within, a, few, dozen, microseconds, the, electric, current, needed, to, establish, the, channel, measured, in, the, tens, or, hundreds, of, amperes, is, dwarfed, by, subsequent, currents, during, the, actual, discharge, initiation, of, the, lightning, leader, is, not, well, understood, the, electric, field, strength, within, the, thundercloud, is, not, typically, large, enough, to, initiate, this, process, by, itself, many, hypotheses, have, been, proposed, one, hypothesis, postulates, that, showers, of, relativistic, electrons, are, created, by, cosmic, rays, and, are, then, accelerated, to, higher, velocities, via, a, process, called, runaway, breakdown, as, these, relativistic, electrons, collide, and, ionize, neutral, air, molecules, they, initiate, leader, formation, another, hypothesis, involves, locally, enhanced, electric, fields, being, formed, near, elongated, water, droplets, or, ice, crystals, percolation, theory, especially, for, the, case, of, biased, percolation, describes, random, connectivity, phenomena, which, produce, an, evolution, of, connected, structures, similar, to, that, of, lightning, strikes, a, streamer, avalanche, model, has, recently, been, favored, by, observational, data, taken, by, lofar, during, storms, when, a, stepped, leader, approaches, the, ground, the, presence, of, opposite, charges, on, the, ground, enhances, the, strength, of, the, electric, field, the, electric, field, is, strongest, on, grounded, objects, whose, tops, are, closest, to, the, base, of, the, thundercloud, such, as, trees, and, tall, buildings, if, the, electric, field, is, strong, enough, a, positively, charged, ionic, channel, called, a, positive, or, upward, streamer, can, develop, from, these, points, this, was, first, theorized, by, heinz, kasemir, as, negatively, charged, leaders, approach, increasing, the, localized, electric, field, strength, grounded, objects, already, experiencing, corona, discharge, will, exceed, a, threshold, and, form, upward, streamers, once, a, downward, leader, connects, to, an, available, upward, leader, a, process, referred, to, as, attachment, a, low, resistance, path, is, formed, and, discharge, may, occur, photographs, have, been, taken, in, which, unattached, streamers, are, clearly, visible, the, unattached, downward, leaders, are, also, visible, in, branched, lightning, none, of, which, are, connected, to, the, earth, although, it, may, appear, they, are, high, speed, videos, can, show, the, attachment, process, in, progress, once, a, conductive, channel, bridges, the, air, gap, between, the, negative, charge, excess, in, the, cloud, and, the, positive, surface, charge, excess, below, there, is, a, large, drop, in, resistance, across, the, lightning, channel, electrons, accelerate, rapidly, as, a, result, in, a, zone, beginning, at, the, point, of, attachment, which, expands, across, the, entire, leader, network, at, up, to, one, third, of, the, speed, of, light, this, is, the, return, stroke, and, it, is, the, most, luminous, and, noticeable, part, of, the, lightning, discharge, a, large, electric, charge, flows, along, the, plasma, channel, from, the, cloud, to, the, ground, neutralising, the, positive, ground, charge, as, electrons, flow, away, from, the, strike, point, to, the, surrounding, area, this, huge, surge, of, current, creates, large, radial, voltage, differences, along, the, surface, of, the, ground, called, step, potentials, they, are, responsible, for, more, injuries, and, deaths, in, groups, of, people, or, of, other, animals, than, the, strike, itself, electricity, takes, every, path, available, to, it, such, step, potentials, will, often, cause, current, to, flow, through, one, leg, and, out, another, electrocuting, an, unlucky, human, or, animal, standing, near, the, point, where, the, lightning, strikes, the, electric, current, of, the, return, stroke, averages, 30, kiloamperes, for, a, typical, negative, cg, flash, often, referred, to, as, negative, cg, lightning, in, some, cases, a, ground, to, cloud, gc, lightning, flash, may, originate, from, a, positively, charged, region, on, the, ground, below, a, storm, these, discharges, normally, originate, from, the, tops, of, very, tall, structures, such, as, communications, antennas, the, rate, at, which, the, return, stroke, current, travels, has, been, found, to, be, around, 100, 000, km, s, one, third, of, the, speed, of, light, the, massive, flow, of, electric, current, occurring, during, the, return, stroke, combined, with, the, rate, at, which, it, occurs, measured, in, microseconds, rapidly, superheats, the, completed, leader, channel, forming, a, highly, electrically, conductive, plasma, channel, the, core, temperature, of, the, plasma, during, the, return, stroke, may, exceed, 27, 800, c, 50, 000, f, causing, it, to, radiate, with, a, brilliant, blue, white, color, once, the, electric, current, stops, flowing, the, channel, cools, and, dissipates, over, tens, or, hundreds, of, milliseconds, often, disappearing, as, fragmented, patches, of, glowing, gas, the, nearly, instantaneous, heating, during, the, return, stroke, causes, the, air, to, expand, explosively, producing, a, powerful, shock, wave, which, is, heard, as, thunder, high, speed, videos, examined, frame, by, frame, show, that, most, negative, cg, lightning, flashes, are, made, up, of, 3, or, 4, individual, strokes, though, there, may, be, as, many, as, 30, each, re, strike, is, separated, by, a, relatively, large, amount, of, time, typically, 40, to, 50, milliseconds, as, other, charged, regions, in, the, cloud, are, discharged, in, subsequent, strokes, re, strikes, often, cause, a, noticeable, strobe, light, effect, to, understand, why, multiple, return, strokes, utilize, the, same, lightning, channel, one, needs, to, understand, the, behavior, of, positive, leaders, which, a, typical, ground, flash, effectively, becomes, following, the, negative, leader, s, connection, with, the, ground, positive, leaders, decay, more, rapidly, than, negative, leaders, do, for, reasons, not, well, understood, bidirectional, leaders, tend, to, initiate, on, the, tips, of, the, decayed, positive, leaders, in, which, the, negative, end, attempts, to, re, ionize, the, leader, network, these, leaders, also, called, recoil, leaders, usually, decay, shortly, after, their, formation, when, they, do, manage, to, make, contact, with, a, conductive, portion, of, the, main, leader, network, a, return, stroke, like, process, occurs, and, a, dart, leader, travels, across, all, or, a, portion, of, the, length, of, the, original, leader, the, dart, leaders, making, connections, with, the, ground, are, what, cause, a, majority, of, subsequent, return, strokes, each, successive, stroke, is, preceded, by, intermediate, dart, leader, strokes, that, have, a, faster, rise, time, but, lower, amplitude, than, the, initial, return, stroke, each, subsequent, stroke, usually, re, uses, the, discharge, channel, taken, by, the, previous, one, but, the, channel, may, be, offset, from, its, previous, position, as, wind, displaces, the, hot, channel, since, recoil, and, dart, leader, processes, do, not, occur, on, negative, leaders, subsequent, return, strokes, very, seldom, utilize, the, same, channel, on, positive, ground, flashes, which, are, explained, later, in, the, article, the, electric, current, within, a, typical, negative, cg, lightning, discharge, rises, very, quickly, to, its, peak, value, in, 1, 10, microseconds, then, decays, more, slowly, over, 50, 200, microseconds, the, transient, nature, of, the, current, within, a, lightning, flash, results, in, several, phenomena, that, need, to, be, addressed, in, the, effective, protection, of, ground, based, structures, rapidly, changing, currents, tend, to, travel, on, the, surface, of, a, conductor, in, what, is, called, the, skin, effect, unlike, direct, currents, which, flow, through, the, entire, conductor, like, water, through, a, hose, hence, conductors, used, in, the, protection, of, facilities, tend, to, be, multi, stranded, with, small, wires, woven, together, this, increases, the, total, bundle, surface, area, in, inverse, proportion, to, the, individual, strand, radius, for, a, fixed, total, cross, sectional, area, the, rapidly, changing, currents, also, create, electromagnetic, pulses, emps, that, radiate, outward, from, the, ionic, channel, this, is, a, characteristic, of, all, electrical, discharges, the, radiated, pulses, rapidly, weaken, as, their, distance, from, the, origin, increases, however, if, they, pass, over, conductive, elements, such, as, power, lines, communication, lines, or, metallic, pipes, they, may, induce, a, current, which, travels, outward, to, its, termination, the, surge, current, is, inversely, related, to, the, surge, impedance, the, higher, in, impedance, the, lower, the, current, this, is, the, surge, that, more, often, than, not, results, in, the, destruction, of, delicate, electronics, electrical, appliances, or, electric, motors, devices, known, as, surge, protectors, spd, or, transient, voltage, surge, suppressors, tvss, attached, in, parallel, with, these, lines, can, detect, the, lightning, flash, s, transient, irregular, current, and, through, alteration, of, its, physical, properties, route, the, spike, to, an, attached, earthing, ground, thereby, protecting, the, equipment, from, damage, three, primary, types, of, lightning, are, defined, by, the, starting, and, ending, points, of, a, flash, channel, there, are, variations, of, each, type, such, as, positive, versus, negative, cg, flashes, that, have, different, physical, characteristics, common, to, each, which, can, be, measured, different, common, names, used, to, describe, a, particular, lightning, event, may, be, attributed, to, the, same, or, to, different, events, cloud, to, ground, cg, lightning, is, a, lightning, discharge, between, a, thundercloud, and, the, ground, it, is, initiated, by, a, stepped, leader, moving, down, from, the, cloud, which, is, met, by, a, streamer, moving, up, from, the, ground, cg, is, the, least, common, but, best, understood, of, all, types, of, lightning, it, is, easier, to, study, scientifically, because, it, terminates, on, a, physical, object, namely, the, ground, and, lends, itself, to, being, measured, by, instruments, on, the, ground, of, the, three, primary, types, of, lightning, it, poses, the, greatest, threat, to, life, and, property, since, it, terminates, on, the, ground, or, strikes, the, overall, discharge, termed, a, flash, is, composed, of, a, number, of, processes, such, as, preliminary, breakdown, stepped, leaders, connecting, leaders, return, strokes, dart, leaders, and, subsequent, return, strokes, the, conductivity, of, the, electrical, ground, be, it, soil, fresh, water, or, salt, water, may, affect, the, lightning, discharge, rate, and, thus, visible, characteristics, cloud, to, ground, cg, lightning, is, either, positive, or, negative, as, defined, by, the, direction, of, the, conventional, electric, current, between, cloud, and, ground, most, cg, lightning, is, negative, meaning, that, a, negative, charge, is, transferred, to, ground, and, electrons, travel, downward, along, the, lightning, channel, conventionally, the, current, flows, from, the, ground, to, the, cloud, the, reverse, happens, in, a, positive, cg, flash, where, electrons, travel, upward, along, the, lightning, channel, and, a, positive, charge, is, transferred, to, the, ground, conventionally, the, current, flows, from, the, cloud, to, the, ground, positive, lightning, is, less, common, than, negative, lightning, and, on, average, makes, up, less, than, 5, of, all, lightning, strikes, there, are, six, different, mechanisms, theorized, to, result, in, the, formation, of, positive, lightning, contrary, to, popular, belief, positive, lightning, flashes, do, not, necessarily, originate, from, the, anvil, or, the, upper, positive, charge, region, and, strike, a, rain, free, area, outside, of, the, thunderstorm, this, belief, is, based, on, the, outdated, idea, that, lightning, leaders, are, unipolar, and, originate, from, their, respective, charge, region, positive, lightning, strikes, tend, to, be, much, more, intense, than, their, negative, counterparts, an, average, bolt, of, negative, lightning, carries, an, electric, current, of, 30, 000, amperes, 30, ka, and, transfers, 15, c, coulombs, of, electric, charge, and, 1, gigajoule, of, energy, large, bolts, of, positive, lightning, can, carry, up, to, 120, ka, and, 350, c, the, average, positive, ground, flash, has, roughly, double, the, peak, current, of, a, typical, negative, flash, and, can, produce, peak, currents, up, to, 400, ka, and, charges, of, several, hundred, coulombs, furthermore, positive, ground, flashes, with, high, peak, currents, are, commonly, followed, by, long, continuing, currents, a, correlation, not, seen, in, negative, ground, flashes, as, a, result, of, their, greater, power, positive, lightning, strikes, are, considerably, more, dangerous, than, negative, strikes, positive, lightning, produces, both, higher, peak, currents, and, longer, continuing, currents, making, them, capable, of, heating, surfaces, to, much, higher, levels, which, increases, the, likelihood, of, a, fire, being, ignited, the, long, distances, positive, lightning, can, propagate, through, clear, air, explains, why, they, are, known, as, bolts, from, the, blue, giving, no, warning, to, observers, despite, the, popular, misconception, that, these, are, positive, lightning, strikes, due, to, them, seemingly, originating, from, the, positive, charge, region, observations, have, shown, that, these, are, in, fact, negative, flashes, they, begin, as, ic, flashes, within, the, cloud, the, negative, leader, then, exits, the, cloud, from, the, positive, charge, region, before, propagating, through, clear, air, and, striking, the, ground, some, distance, away, positive, lightning, has, also, been, shown, to, trigger, the, occurrence, of, upward, lightning, flashes, from, the, tops, of, tall, structures, and, is, largely, responsible, for, the, initiation, of, sprites, several, tens, of, kilometers, above, ground, level, positive, lightning, tends, to, occur, more, frequently, in, winter, storms, as, with, thundersnow, during, intense, tornadoes, and, in, the, dissipation, stage, of, a, thunderstorm, huge, quantities, of, extremely, low, frequency, elf, and, very, low, frequency, vlf, radio, waves, are, also, generated, lightning, discharges, may, occur, between, areas, of, cloud, without, contacting, the, ground, when, it, occurs, between, two, separate, clouds, it, is, known, as, cloud, to, cloud, cc, or, inter, cloud, lightning, when, it, occurs, between, areas, of, differing, electric, potential, within, a, single, cloud, it, is, known, as, intra, cloud, ic, lightning, ic, lightning, is, the, most, frequently, occurring, type, ic, lightning, most, commonly, occurs, between, the, upper, anvil, portion, and, lower, reaches, of, a, given, thunderstorm, this, lightning, can, sometimes, be, observed, at, great, distances, at, night, as, so, called, sheet, lightning, in, such, instances, the, observer, may, see, only, a, flash, of, light, without, hearing, any, thunder, another, term, used, for, cloud, cloud, or, cloud, cloud, ground, lightning, is, anvil, crawler, due, to, the, habit, of, charge, typically, originating, beneath, or, within, the, anvil, and, scrambling, through, the, upper, cloud, layers, of, a, thunderstorm, often, generating, dramatic, multiple, branch, strokes, these, are, usually, seen, as, a, thunderstorm, passes, over, the, observer, or, begins, to, decay, the, most, vivid, crawler, behavior, occurs, in, well, developed, thunderstorms, that, feature, extensive, rear, anvil, shearing, objects, struck, by, lightning, experience, heat, and, magnetic, forces, of, great, magnitude, the, heat, created, by, lightning, currents, travelling, through, a, tree, may, vaporize, its, sap, causing, a, steam, explosion, that, bursts, the, trunk, as, lightning, travels, through, sandy, soil, the, soil, surrounding, the, plasma, channel, may, melt, forming, tubular, structures, called, fulgurites, buildings, or, tall, structures, hit, by, lightning, may, be, damaged, as, the, lightning, seeks, unimpeded, paths, to, the, ground, by, safely, conducting, a, lightning, strike, to, the, ground, a, lightning, protection, system, usually, incorporating, at, least, one, lightning, rod, can, greatly, reduce, the, probability, of, severe, property, damage, aircraft, are, highly, susceptible, to, being, struck, due, to, their, metallic, fuselages, but, lightning, strikes, are, generally, not, dangerous, to, them, due, to, the, conductive, properties, of, aluminium, alloy, the, fuselage, acts, as, a, faraday, cage, present, day, aircraft, are, built, to, be, safe, from, a, lightning, strike, and, passengers, will, generally, not, even, know, that, it, has, happened, although, 90, percent, of, people, struck, by, lightning, survive, animals, including, humans, struck, by, lightning, may, suffer, severe, injury, due, to, internal, organ, and, nervous, system, damage, lightning, serves, an, important, role, in, the, nitrogen, cycle, by, oxidizing, diatomic, nitrogen, in, the, air, into, nitrates, which, are, deposited, by, rain, and, can, fertilize, the, growth, of, plants, and, other, organisms, because, the, electrostatic, discharge, of, terrestrial, lightning, superheats, the, air, to, plasma, temperatures, along, the, length, of, the, discharge, channel, in, a, short, duration, kinetic, theory, dictates, gaseous, molecules, undergo, a, rapid, increase, in, pressure, and, thus, expand, outward, from, the, lightning, creating, a, shock, wave, audible, as, thunder, since, the, sound, waves, propagate, not, from, a, single, point, source, but, along, the, length, of, the, lightning, s, path, the, sound, origin, s, varying, distances, from, the, observer, can, generate, a, rolling, or, rumbling, effect, perception, of, the, sonic, characteristics, is, further, complicated, by, factors, such, as, the, irregular, and, possibly, branching, geometry, of, the, lightning, channel, by, acoustic, echoing, from, terrain, and, by, the, usually, multiple, stroke, characteristic, of, the, lightning, strike, light, travels, at, about, 300, 000, 000, m, s, 980, 000, 000, ft, s, and, sound, travels, through, air, at, about, 343, m, s, 1, 130, ft, s, an, observer, can, approximate, the, distance, to, the, strike, by, timing, the, interval, between, the, visible, lightning, and, the, audible, thunder, it, generates, a, lightning, flash, preceding, its, thunder, by, one, second, would, be, approximately, 343, m, 1, 125, ft, in, distance, a, delay, of, three, seconds, would, indicate, a, distance, of, about, 1, km, or, 0, 62, mi, 3, 343, m, a, flash, preceding, thunder, by, five, seconds, would, indicate, a, distance, of, approximately, 1, 7, km, or, 1, 1, mi, 5, 343, m, consequently, a, lightning, strike, observed, at, a, very, close, distance, will, be, accompanied, by, a, sudden, clap, of, thunder, with, almost, no, perceptible, time, lapse, possibly, accompanied, by, the, smell, of, ozone, o, 3, lightning, at, a, sufficient, distance, may, be, seen, and, not, heard, there, is, data, that, a, lightning, storm, can, be, seen, at, over, 160, km, 100, mi, whereas, the, thunder, travels, about, 32, km, 20, mi, anecdotally, there, are, many, examples, of, people, saying, the, storm, was, directly, overhead, or, all, around, and, yet, there, was, no, thunder, since, thunderclouds, can, be, up, to, 20, km, high, lightning, occurring, high, up, in, the, cloud, may, appear, close, but, is, actually, too, far, away, to, produce, noticeable, thunder, lightning, discharges, generate, radio, frequency, pulses, which, can, be, received, thousands, of, kilometres, from, their, source, as, radio, atmospheric, signals, and, whistlers, the, production, of, x, rays, by, a, bolt, of, lightning, was, predicted, as, early, as, 1925, by, c, t, r, wilson, but, no, evidence, was, found, until, 2001, 2002, when, researchers, at, the, new, mexico, institute, of, mining, and, technology, detected, x, ray, emissions, from, an, induced, lightning, strike, along, a, grounded, wire, trailed, behind, a, rocket, shot, into, a, storm, cloud, in, the, same, year, university, of, florida, and, florida, tech, researchers, used, an, array, of, electric, field, and, x, ray, detectors, at, a, lightning, research, facility, in, north, florida, to, confirm, that, natural, lightning, makes, x, rays, in, large, quantities, during, the, propagation, of, stepped, leaders, the, cause, of, the, x, ray, emissions, is, still, a, matter, for, research, as, the, temperature, of, lightning, is, too, low, to, account, for, the, x, rays, observed, a, number, of, observations, by, space, based, telescopes, have, revealed, even, higher, energy, gamma, ray, emissions, the, so, called, terrestrial, gamma, ray, flashes, tgfs, these, observations, pose, a, challenge, to, current, theories, of, lightning, especially, with, the, recent, discovery, of, the, clear, signatures, of, antimatter, produced, in, lightning, recent, research, has, shown, that, secondary, species, produced, by, these, tgfs, such, as, electrons, positrons, neutrons, or, protons, can, gain, energies, of, up, to, several, tens, of, mev, the, very, high, temperatures, generated, by, lightning, lead, to, significant, local, increases, in, ozone, and, oxides, of, nitrogen, each, lightning, flash, in, temperate, and, sub, tropical, areas, produces, 7, kg, of, no, x, on, average, in, the, troposphere, the, effect, of, lightning, can, increase, no, x, by, 90, and, ozone, by, 30, volcanic, activity, produces, lightning, friendly, conditions, in, multiple, ways, the, enormous, quantity, of, pulverized, material, and, gases, explosively, ejected, into, the, atmosphere, creates, a, dense, plume, of, particles, the, ash, density, and, constant, motion, within, the, volcanic, plume, produces, charge, by, frictional, interactions, triboelectrification, resulting, in, very, powerful, and, very, frequent, flashes, as, the, cloud, attempts, to, neutralize, itself, due, to, the, extensive, solid, material, ash, content, unlike, the, water, rich, charge, generating, zones, of, a, normal, thundercloud, it, is, often, called, a, dirty, thunderstorm, if, the, volcanic, ash, plume, rises, to, freezing, temperatures, ice, particles, form, and, collide, with, ash, particles, to, cause, electrification, lightning, can, be, detected, in, any, explosion, but, the, causation, of, additional, electrification, from, ice, particles, in, ash, can, lead, to, a, stronger, electrical, field, and, a, higher, rate, of, detectable, lightning, lightning, is, also, used, as, a, volcano, monitoring, tool, for, detecting, hazardous, eruptions, intense, forest, fires, such, as, those, seen, in, the, 2019, 20, australian, bushfire, season, can, create, their, own, weather, systems, that, can, produce, lightning, and, other, weather, phenomena, intense, heat, from, a, fire, causes, air, to, rapidly, rise, within, the, smoke, plume, causing, the, formation, of, pyrocumulonimbus, clouds, cooler, air, is, drawn, in, by, this, turbulent, rising, air, helping, to, cool, the, plume, the, rising, plume, is, further, cooled, by, the, lower, atmospheric, pressure, at, high, altitude, allowing, the, moisture, in, it, to, condense, into, cloud, pyrocumulonimbus, clouds, form, in, an, unstable, atmosphere, these, weather, systems, can, produce, dry, lightning, fire, tornadoes, intense, winds, and, dirty, hail, lightning, has, been, observed, within, the, atmospheres, of, other, planets, such, as, jupiter, saturn, and, probably, uranus, and, neptune, lightning, on, jupiter, is, far, more, energetic, than, on, earth, despite, seeming, to, be, generated, via, the, same, mechanism, recently, a, new, type, of, lightning, was, detected, on, jupiter, thought, to, originate, from, mushballs, including, ammonia, on, saturn, lightning, initially, referred, to, as, saturn, electrostatic, discharge, was, discovered, by, the, voyager, 1, mission, lightning, on, venus, has, been, a, controversial, subject, after, decades, of, study, during, the, soviet, venera, and, u, s, pioneer, missions, of, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, signals, suggesting, lightning, may, be, present, in, the, upper, atmosphere, were, detected, the, short, cassini, huygens, mission, fly, by, of, venus, in, 1999, detected, no, signs, of, lightning, but, radio, pulses, recorded, by, the, spacecraft, venus, express, which, began, orbiting, venus, in, april, 2006, may, originate, from, lightning, on, venus, the, science, of, lightning, is, called, fulminology, lightning, causes, thunder, a, sound, from, the, shock, wave, which, develops, as, gases, in, the, vicinity, of, the, discharge, heat, suddenly, to, very, high, temperatures, it, is, often, heard, a, few, seconds, after, the, lightning, itself, thunder, is, heard, as, a, rolling, gradually, dissipating, rumble, because, the, sound, from, different, portions, of, a, long, stroke, arrives, at, slightly, different, times, when, the, local, electric, field, exceeds, the, dielectric, strength, of, damp, air, about, 3, mv, m, electrical, discharge, results, in, a, strike, often, followed, by, commensurate, discharges, branching, from, the, same, path, mechanisms, that, cause, the, charges, to, build, up, to, lightning, are, still, a, matter, of, scientific, investigation, a, 2016, study, confirmed, dielectric, breakdown, is, involved, lightning, may, be, caused, by, the, circulation, of, warm, moisture, filled, air, through, electric, fields, ice, or, water, particles, then, accumulate, charge, as, in, a, van, de, graaff, generator, researchers, at, the, university, of, florida, found, that, the, final, one, dimensional, speeds, of, 10, flashes, observed, were, between, 1, 0, 10, 5, and, 1, 4, 10, 6, m, s, with, an, average, of, 4, 4, 10, 5, m, s, the, earliest, detector, invented, to, warn, of, the, approach, of, a, thunderstorm, was, the, lightning, bell, benjamin, franklin, installed, one, such, device, in, his, house, the, detector, was, based, on, an, electrostatic, device, called, the, electric, chimes, invented, by, andrew, gordon, in, 1742, lightning, discharges, generate, a, wide, range, of, electromagnetic, radiations, including, radio, frequency, pulses, the, times, at, which, a, pulse, from, a, given, lightning, discharge, arrives, at, several, receivers, can, be, used, to, locate, the, source, of, the, discharge, with, a, precision, on, the, order, of, metres, the, united, states, federal, government, has, constructed, a, nationwide, grid, of, such, lightning, detectors, allowing, lightning, discharges, to, be, tracked, in, real, time, throughout, the, continental, u, s, in, addition, blitzortung, a, private, global, detection, system, that, consists, of, over, 500, detection, stations, owned, and, operated, by, hobbyists, volunteers, provides, near, real, time, lightning, maps, at, the, earth, ionosphere, waveguide, traps, electromagnetic, vlf, and, elf, waves, electromagnetic, pulses, transmitted, by, lightning, strikes, propagate, within, that, waveguide, the, waveguide, is, dispersive, which, means, that, their, group, velocity, depends, on, frequency, the, difference, of, the, group, time, delay, of, a, lightning, pulse, at, adjacent, frequencies, is, proportional, to, the, distance, between, transmitter, and, receiver, together, with, direction, finding, methods, this, allows, locating, lightning, strikes, up, to, distances, of, 10, 000, km, from, their, origin, moreover, the, eigenfrequencies, of, the, earth, ionospheric, waveguide, the, schumann, resonances, at, about, 7, 5, hz, are, used, to, determine, the, global, thunderstorm, activity, in, addition, to, ground, based, lightning, detection, several, instruments, aboard, satellites, have, been, constructed, to, observe, lightning, distribution, these, include, the, optical, transient, detector, otd, aboard, the, orbview, 1, satellite, launched, on, april, 3, 1995, and, the, subsequent, lightning, imaging, sensor, lis, aboard, trmm, launched, on, november, 28, 1997, starting, in, 2016, the, national, oceanic, and, atmospheric, administration, launched, geostationary, operational, environmental, satellite, r, series, goes, r, weather, satellites, outfitted, with, geostationary, lightning, mapper, glm, instruments, which, are, near, infrared, optical, transient, detectors, that, can, detect, the, momentary, changes, in, an, optical, scene, indicating, the, presence, of, lightning, the, lightning, detection, data, can, be, converted, into, a, real, time, map, of, lightning, activity, across, the, western, hemisphere, this, mapping, technique, has, been, implemented, by, the, united, states, national, weather, service, in, 2022, eumetsat, plan, to, launch, the, lightning, imager, mtg, i, li, on, board, meteosat, third, generation, this, will, complement, noaa, s, glm, mtg, i, li, will, cover, europe, and, africa, and, will, include, products, on, events, groups, and, flashes, the, movement, of, electrical, charges, produces, a, magnetic, field, see, electromagnetism, the, intense, currents, of, a, lightning, discharge, create, a, fleeting, but, very, strong, magnetic, field, where, the, lightning, current, path, passes, through, rock, soil, or, metal, these, materials, can, become, permanently, magnetized, this, effect, is, known, as, lightning, induced, remanent, magnetism, or, lirm, these, currents, follow, the, least, resistive, path, often, horizontally, near, the, surface, but, sometimes, vertically, where, faults, ore, bodies, or, ground, water, offers, a, less, resistive, path, one, theory, suggests, that, lodestones, natural, magnets, encountered, in, ancient, times, were, created, in, this, manner, lightning, induced, magnetic, anomalies, can, be, mapped, in, the, ground, and, analysis, of, magnetized, materials, can, confirm, lightning, was, the, source, of, the, magnetization, and, provide, an, estimate, of, the, peak, current, of, the, lightning, discharge, research, at, the, university, of, innsbruck, has, calculated, that, magnetic, fields, generated, by, plasma, may, induce, hallucinations, in, subjects, located, within, 200, m, 660, ft, of, a, severe, lightning, storm, like, what, happened, in, transcranial, magnetic, stimulation, tms, some, high, energy, cosmic, rays, produced, by, supernovas, as, well, as, solar, particles, from, the, solar, wind, enter, the, atmosphere, and, electrify, the, air, which, may, create, pathways, for, lightning, bolts, due, to, the, low, resolution, of, global, climate, models, accurately, representing, lightning, in, these, climate, models, is, difficult, largely, due, to, their, inability, to, simulate, the, convection, and, cloud, ice, fundamental, to, lightning, formation, research, from, the, future, climate, for, africa, programme, demonstrates, that, using, a, convection, permitting, model, over, africa, can, more, accurately, capture, convective, thunderstorms, and, the, distribution, of, ice, particles, this, research, indicates, climate, change, may, increase, the, total, amount, of, lightning, only, slightly, the, total, number, of, lightning, days, per, year, decreases, while, more, cloud, ice, and, stronger, convection, leads, to, more, lightning, strikes, occurring, on, days, when, lightning, does, occur, a, study, from, the, university, of, washington, looked, at, lightning, activity, in, the, arctic, from, 2010, to, 2020, the, ratio, of, arctic, summertime, strokes, was, compared, to, total, global, strokes, and, was, observed, to, be, increasing, with, time, indicating, that, the, region, is, becoming, more, influenced, by, lightning, the, fraction, of, strokes, above, 65, degrees, north, was, found, to, be, increasing, linearly, with, the, noaa, global, temperature, anomaly, and, grew, by, a, factor, of, 3, as, the, anomaly, increased, from, 0, 65, to, 0, 95, c, paleolightning, refers, to, the, remnants, of, ancient, lightning, activity, studied, in, fields, such, as, historical, geology, geoarchaeology, and, fulminology, paleolightning, provides, tangible, evidence, for, the, study, lightning, activity, in, earth, s, past, and, the, roles, lightning, may, have, played, in, earth, s, history, some, studies, have, speculated, that, lightning, activity, played, a, crucial, role, in, the, development, of, not, only, earth, s, early, atmosphere, but, also, early, life, lightning, a, non, biological, process, has, been, found, to, produce, biologically, useful, material, through, the, oxidation, and, reduction, of, inorganic, matter, research, on, the, impact, of, lightning, on, earth, s, atmosphere, continues, today, especially, with, regard, to, feedback, mechanisms, of, lightning, produced, nitrate, compounds, on, atmospheric, composition, and, global, average, temperatures, in, many, cultures, lightning, has, been, viewed, as, a, sign, or, part, of, a, deity, or, a, deity, in, and, of, itself, these, include, the, greek, god, zeus, the, aztec, god, tlaloc, the, mayan, god, k, slavic, mythology, s, perun, the, baltic, p, rkons, perk, nas, thor, in, norse, mythology, ukko, in, finnish, mythology, the, hindu, god, indra, the, yoruba, god, sango, illapa, in, inca, mythology, and, the, shinto, god, raijin, the, ancient, etruscans, produced, guides, to, brontoscopic, and, fulgural, divination, of, the, future, based, on, the, omens, supposedly, displayed, by, thunder, or, lightning, occurring, on, particular, days, of, the, year, or, in, particular, places, such, use, of, thunder, and, lightning, in, divination, is, also, known, as, ceraunoscopy, a, kind, of, aeromancy, in, the, traditional, religion, of, the, african, bantu, tribes, lightning, is, a, sign, of, the, ire, of, the, gods, scriptures, in, judaism, islam, and, christianity, also, ascribe, supernatural, importance, to, lightning, in, christianity, the, second, coming, of, jesus, is, compared, to, lightning, although, sometimes, used, figuratively, the, idea, that, lightning, never, strikes, the, same, place, twice, is, a, common, myth, in, fact, lightning, can, and, often, does, strike, the, same, place, more, than, once, lightning, in, a, thunderstorm, is, more, likely, to, strike, objects, and, spots, that, are, more, prominent, or, conductive, for, instance, lightning, strikes, the, empire, state, building, in, new, york, city, on, average, 23, times, per, year, in, french, and, italian, the, expression, for, love, at, first, sight, is, coup, de, foudre, and, colpo, di, fulmine, respectively, which, literally, translated, means, lightning, strike, some, european, languages, have, a, separate, word, for, lightning, which, strikes, the, ground, as, opposed, to, lightning, in, general, often, it, is, a, cognate, of, the, english, word, rays, the, name, of, australia, s, most, celebrated, thoroughbred, horse, phar, lap, derives, from, the, shared, zhuang, and, thai, word, for, lightning, the, bolt, of, lightning, in, heraldry, is, called, a, thunderbolt, and, is, shown, as, a, zigzag, with, non, pointed, ends, this, symbol, usually, represents, power, and, speed, some, political, parties, use, lightning, flashes, as, a, symbol, of, power, such, as, the, people, s, action, party, in, singapore, the, british, union, of, fascists, during, the, 1930s, and, the, national, states, rights, party, in, the, united,
