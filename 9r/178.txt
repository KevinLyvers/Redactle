crux, k, r, k, s, is, a, constellation, of, the, southern, sky, that, is, centred, on, four, bright, stars, in, a, cross, shaped, asterism, commonly, known, as, the, southern, cross, it, lies, on, the, southern, end, of, the, milky, way, s, visible, band, the, name, crux, is, latin, for, cross, even, though, it, is, the, smallest, of, all, 88, modern, constellations, crux, is, among, the, most, easily, distinguished, as, its, four, main, stars, each, have, an, apparent, visual, magnitude, brighter, than, 2, 8, it, has, attained, a, high, level, of, cultural, significance, in, many, southern, hemisphere, states, and, nations, blue, white, crucis, acrux, is, the, most, southerly, member, of, the, constellation, and, at, magnitude, 0, 8, the, brightest, the, three, other, stars, of, the, cross, appear, clockwise, and, in, order, of, lessening, magnitude, crucis, mimosa, crucis, gacrux, and, crucis, imai, crucis, ginan, also, lies, within, the, cross, asterism, many, of, these, brighter, stars, are, members, of, the, scorpius, centaurus, association, a, large, but, loose, group, of, hot, blue, white, stars, that, appear, to, share, common, origins, and, motion, across, the, southern, milky, way, crux, contains, four, cepheid, variables, each, visible, to, the, naked, eye, under, optimum, conditions, crux, also, contains, the, bright, and, colourful, open, cluster, known, as, the, jewel, box, ngc, 4755, on, its, eastern, border, nearby, to, the, southeast, is, a, large, dark, nebula, spanning, 7, by, 5, known, as, the, coalsack, nebula, portions, of, which, are, mapped, in, the, neighbouring, constellations, of, centaurus, and, musca, the, crux, can, be, seen, on, the, flags, of, australia, and, new, zealand, with, australia, s, national, anthem, advance, australia, fair, mentioning, it, the, bright, stars, in, crux, were, known, to, the, ancient, greeks, where, ptolemy, regarded, them, as, part, of, the, constellation, centaurus, they, were, entirely, visible, as, far, north, as, britain, in, the, fourth, millennium, bc, however, the, precession, of, the, equinoxes, gradually, lowered, the, stars, below, the, european, horizon, and, they, were, eventually, forgotten, by, the, inhabitants, of, northern, latitudes, by, 400, ad, the, stars, in, the, constellation, now, called, crux, never, rose, above, the, horizon, throughout, most, of, europe, dante, may, have, known, about, the, constellation, in, the, 14th, century, as, he, describes, an, asterism, of, four, bright, stars, in, the, southern, sky, in, his, divine, comedy, his, description, however, may, be, allegorical, and, the, similarity, to, the, constellation, a, coincidence, the, 15th, century, venetian, navigator, alvise, cadamosto, made, note, of, what, was, probably, the, southern, cross, on, exiting, the, gambia, river, in, 1455, calling, it, the, carro, dell, ostro, southern, chariot, however, cadamosto, s, accompanying, diagram, was, inaccurate, historians, generally, credit, jo, o, faras, for, being, the, first, european, to, depict, it, correctly, faras, sketched, and, described, the, constellation, calling, it, las, guardas, in, a, letter, written, on, the, beaches, of, brazil, on, 1, may, 1500, to, the, portuguese, monarch, explorer, amerigo, vespucci, seems, to, have, observed, not, only, the, southern, cross, but, also, the, neighboring, coalsack, nebula, on, his, second, voyage, in, 1501, 1502, another, early, modern, description, clearly, describing, crux, as, a, separate, constellation, is, attributed, to, andrea, corsali, an, italian, navigator, who, from, 1515, to, 1517, sailed, to, china, and, the, east, indies, in, an, expedition, sponsored, by, king, manuel, i, in, 1516, corsali, wrote, a, letter, to, the, monarch, describing, his, observations, of, the, southern, sky, which, included, a, rather, crude, map, of, the, stars, around, the, south, celestial, pole, including, the, southern, cross, and, the, two, magellanic, clouds, seen, in, an, external, orientation, as, on, a, globe, emery, molyneux, and, petrus, plancius, have, also, been, cited, as, the, first, uranographers, sky, mappers, to, distinguish, crux, as, a, separate, constellation, their, representations, date, from, 1592, the, former, depicting, it, on, his, celestial, globe, and, the, latter, in, one, of, the, small, celestial, maps, on, his, large, wall, map, both, authors, however, depended, on, unreliable, sources, and, placed, crux, in, the, wrong, position, crux, was, first, shown, in, its, correct, position, on, the, celestial, globes, of, petrus, plancius, and, jodocus, hondius, in, 1598, and, 1600, its, stars, were, first, catalogued, separately, from, centaurus, by, frederick, de, houtman, in, 1603, the, constellation, was, later, adopted, by, jakob, bartsch, in, 1624, and, augustin, royer, in, 1679, royer, is, sometimes, wrongly, cited, as, initially, distinguishing, crux, crux, is, bordered, by, the, constellations, centaurus, which, surrounds, it, on, three, sides, on, the, east, north, and, west, and, musca, to, the, south, covering, 68, square, degrees, and, 0, 165, of, the, night, sky, it, is, the, smallest, of, the, 88, constellations, the, three, letter, abbreviation, for, the, constellation, as, adopted, by, the, international, astronomical, union, in, 1922, is, cru, the, official, constellation, boundaries, as, set, by, belgian, astronomer, eug, ne, delporte, in, 1930, are, defined, by, a, polygon, of, four, segments, in, the, equatorial, coordinate, system, the, right, ascension, coordinates, of, these, borders, lie, between, 11, h, 56, 13, m, and, 12, h, 57, 45, m, while, the, declination, coordinates, are, between, 55, 68, and, 64, 70, its, totality, figures, at, least, part, of, the, year, south, of, the, 25th, parallel, north, in, tropical, regions, crux, can, be, seen, in, the, sky, from, april, to, june, crux, is, exactly, opposite, to, cassiopeia, on, the, celestial, sphere, and, therefore, it, cannot, appear, in, the, sky, with, the, latter, at, the, same, time, in, this, era, south, of, cape, town, adelaide, and, buenos, aires, the, 34th, parallel, south, crux, is, circumpolar, and, thus, always, appears, in, the, sky, crux, is, sometimes, confused, with, the, nearby, false, cross, asterism, by, stargazers, the, false, cross, consists, of, stars, in, carina, and, vela, is, larger, and, dimmer, does, not, have, a, fifth, star, and, lacks, the, two, prominent, nearby, pointer, stars, between, the, two, is, the, even, larger, and, dimmer, diamond, cross, crux, is, easily, visible, from, the, southern, hemisphere, south, of, 35th, parallel, at, practically, any, time, of, year, as, circumpolar, it, is, also, visible, near, the, horizon, from, tropical, latitudes, of, the, northern, hemisphere, for, a, few, hours, every, night, during, the, northern, winter, and, spring, for, instance, it, is, visible, from, cancun, or, any, other, place, at, latitude, 25, n, or, less, at, around, 10, pm, at, the, end, of, april, there, are, 5, main, stars, due, to, precession, crux, will, move, closer, to, the, south, pole, in, the, next, millennia, up, to, 67, degrees, south, declination, for, the, middle, of, the, constellation, however, by, the, year, 14, 000, crux, will, be, visible, for, most, parts, of, europe, and, the, continental, united, states, its, visibility, will, extend, to, north, europe, by, the, year, 18, 000, when, it, will, be, less, than, 30, degrees, south, declination, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, southern, cross, is, frequently, used, for, navigation, in, much, the, same, way, that, polaris, is, used, in, the, northern, hemisphere, projecting, a, line, from, to, crucis, the, foot, of, the, crucifix, approximately, 4, 1, 2, times, beyond, gives, a, point, close, to, the, southern, celestial, pole, which, is, also, coincidentally, where, intersects, a, perpendicular, line, taken, southwards, from, the, east, west, axis, of, alpha, centauri, to, beta, centauri, which, are, stars, at, an, alike, declination, to, crux, and, of, a, similar, width, as, the, cross, but, higher, magnitude, argentine, gauchos, are, documented, as, using, crux, for, night, orientation, in, the, pampas, and, patagonia, alpha, and, beta, centauri, are, of, similar, declinations, thus, distance, from, the, pole, and, are, often, referred, as, the, southern, pointers, or, just, the, pointers, allowing, people, to, easily, identify, the, southern, cross, the, constellation, of, crux, very, few, bright, stars, lie, between, crux, and, the, pole, itself, although, the, constellation, musca, is, fairly, easily, recognised, immediately, south, of, crux, down, to, apparent, magnitude, 2, 5, are, 92, stars, that, shine, the, brightest, as, viewed, from, the, earth, three, of, these, stars, are, in, crux, making, it, the, most, densely, populated, as, to, those, stars, this, being, 3, 26, of, these, 92, stars, and, in, turn, being, 19, 2, times, more, than, the, expected, 0, 17, that, would, result, on, a, homogenous, distribution, of, all, bright, stars, and, a, randomised, drawing, of, all, 88, constellations, given, its, area, 0, 17, of, the, sky, within, the, constellation, s, borders, there, are, 49, stars, brighter, than, or, equal, to, apparent, magnitude, 6, 5, the, four, main, stars, that, form, the, asterism, are, alpha, beta, gamma, and, delta, crucis, there, is, also, a, fifth, star, that, is, often, included, with, the, southern, cross, there, are, several, other, naked, eye, stars, within, the, borders, of, crux, especially, unusually, a, total, of, 15, of, the, 23, brightest, stars, in, crux, are, spectrally, blue, white, b, type, stars, among, the, five, main, bright, stars, delta, and, probably, alpha, and, beta, are, likely, co, moving, b, type, members, of, the, scorpius, centaurus, association, the, nearest, ob, association, to, the, sun, they, are, among, the, highest, mass, stellar, members, of, the, lower, centaurus, crux, subgroup, of, the, association, with, ages, of, roughly, 10, to, 20, million, years, other, members, include, the, blue, white, stars, zeta, lambda, and, both, the, components, of, the, visual, double, star, mu, crux, contains, many, variable, stars, it, boasts, four, cepheid, variables, that, may, all, reach, naked, eye, visibility, other, well, studied, variable, stars, includes, the, star, hd, 106906, has, been, found, to, have, a, planet, hd, 106906, b, that, has, one, of, the, widest, orbits, of, any, currently, known, planetary, mass, companions, crux, is, backlit, by, the, multitude, of, stars, of, the, scutum, crux, arm, more, commonly, called, the, scutum, centaurus, arm, of, the, milky, way, this, is, the, main, inner, arm, in, the, local, radial, quarter, of, the, galaxy, part, obscuring, this, is, a, key, feature, of, the, scutum, crux, arm, is, the, most, prominent, feature, of, crux, is, the, distinctive, asterism, known, as, the, southern, cross, it, has, great, significance, in, the, cultures, of, the, southern, hemisphere, particularly, of, australia, brazil, chile, and, new, zealand, several, southern, countries, and, organisations, have, traditionally, used, crux, as, a, national, or, distinctive, symbol, the, four,
