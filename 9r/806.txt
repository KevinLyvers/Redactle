a, drainage, basin, is, an, area, of, land, where, all, flowing, surface, water, converges, to, a, single, point, such, as, a, river, mouth, or, flows, into, another, body, of, water, such, as, a, lake, or, ocean, a, basin, is, separated, from, adjacent, basins, by, a, perimeter, the, drainage, divide, made, up, of, a, succession, of, elevated, features, such, as, ridges, and, hills, a, basin, may, consist, of, smaller, basins, that, merge, at, river, confluences, forming, a, hierarchical, pattern, other, terms, for, a, drainage, basin, are, catchment, area, catchment, basin, drainage, area, river, basin, water, basin, and, impluvium, in, north, america, they, are, commonly, called, a, watershed, though, in, other, english, speaking, places, watershed, is, used, only, in, its, original, sense, that, of, a, drainage, divide, a, drainage, basin, s, boundaries, are, determined, by, watershed, delineation, a, common, task, in, environmental, engineering, and, science, in, a, closed, drainage, basin, or, endorheic, basin, rather, than, flowing, to, the, ocean, water, converges, toward, the, interior, of, the, basin, known, as, a, sink, which, may, be, a, permanent, lake, a, dry, lake, or, a, point, where, surface, water, is, lost, underground, drainage, basins, are, similar, but, not, identical, to, hydrologic, unit, code, which, are, drainage, areas, delineated, so, as, to, nest, into, a, multi, level, hierarchical, drainage, system, hydrologic, units, are, defined, to, allow, multiple, inlets, outlets, or, sinks, in, a, strict, sense, all, drainage, basins, are, hydrologic, units, but, not, all, hydrologic, units, are, drainage, basins, about, 48, 71, of, the, world, s, land, drains, to, the, atlantic, ocean, in, north, america, surface, water, drains, to, the, atlantic, via, the, saint, lawrence, river, and, great, lakes, basins, the, eastern, seaboard, of, the, united, states, the, canadian, maritimes, and, most, of, newfoundland, and, labrador, nearly, all, of, south, america, east, of, the, andes, also, drains, to, the, atlantic, as, does, most, of, western, and, central, europe, and, the, greatest, portion, of, western, sub, saharan, africa, as, well, as, western, sahara, and, part, of, morocco, the, two, major, mediterranean, seas, of, the, world, also, flow, to, the, atlantic, the, caribbean, sea, and, gulf, of, mexico, basin, includes, most, of, the, u, s, interior, between, the, appalachian, and, rocky, mountains, a, small, part, of, the, canadian, provinces, of, alberta, and, saskatchewan, eastern, central, america, the, islands, of, the, caribbean, and, the, gulf, and, a, small, part, of, northern, south, america, the, mediterranean, sea, basin, with, the, black, sea, includes, much, of, north, africa, east, central, africa, through, the, nile, river, southern, central, and, eastern, europe, turkey, and, the, coastal, areas, of, israel, lebanon, and, syria, the, arctic, ocean, drains, most, of, western, canada, and, northern, canada, east, of, the, continental, divide, northern, alaska, and, parts, of, north, dakota, south, dakota, minnesota, and, montana, in, the, united, states, the, north, shore, of, the, scandinavian, peninsula, in, europe, central, and, northern, russia, and, parts, of, kazakhstan, and, mongolia, in, asia, which, totals, to, about, 17, of, the, world, s, land, just, over, 13, of, the, land, in, the, world, drains, to, the, pacific, ocean, its, basin, includes, much, of, china, eastern, and, southeastern, russia, japan, the, korean, peninsula, most, of, indochina, indonesia, and, malaysia, the, philippines, all, of, the, pacific, islands, the, northeast, coast, of, australia, and, canada, and, the, united, states, west, of, the, continental, divide, including, most, of, alaska, as, well, as, western, central, america, and, south, america, west, of, the, andes, the, indian, ocean, s, drainage, basin, also, comprises, about, 13, of, earth, s, land, it, drains, the, eastern, coast, of, africa, the, coasts, of, the, red, sea, and, the, persian, gulf, the, indian, subcontinent, burma, and, most, parts, of, australia, the, five, largest, river, basins, by, area, from, largest, to, smallest, are, those, of, the, amazon, 7m, km, 2, the, congo, 4m, km, 2, the, nile, 3, 4m, km, 2, the, mississippi, 3, 22m, km, 2, and, the, r, o, de, la, plata, 3, 17m, km, 2, the, three, rivers, that, drain, the, most, water, from, most, to, least, are, the, amazon, ganges, and, congo, rivers, endorheic, basin, are, inland, basins, that, do, not, drain, to, an, ocean, endorheic, basins, cover, around, 18, of, the, earth, s, land, some, endorheic, basins, drain, to, an, endorheic, lake, or, inland, sea, many, of, these, lakes, are, ephemeral, or, vary, dramatically, in, size, depending, on, climate, and, inflow, if, water, evaporates, or, infiltrates, into, the, ground, at, its, terminus, the, area, can, go, by, several, names, such, playa, salt, flat, dry, lake, or, alkali, sink, the, largest, endorheic, basins, are, in, central, asia, including, the, caspian, sea, the, aral, sea, and, numerous, smaller, lakes, other, endorheic, regions, include, the, great, basin, in, the, united, states, much, of, the, sahara, desert, the, drainage, basin, of, the, okavango, river, kalahari, basin, highlands, near, the, african, great, lakes, the, interiors, of, australia, and, the, arabian, peninsula, and, parts, in, mexico, and, the, andes, some, of, these, such, as, the, great, basin, are, not, single, drainage, basins, but, collections, of, separate, adjacent, closed, basins, in, endorheic, bodies, of, water, where, evaporation, is, the, primary, means, of, water, loss, the, water, is, typically, more, saline, than, the, oceans, an, extreme, example, of, this, is, the, dead, sea, drainage, basins, have, been, historically, important, for, determining, territorial, boundaries, particularly, in, regions, where, trade, by, water, has, been, important, for, example, the, english, crown, gave, the, hudson, s, bay, company, a, monopoly, on, the, fur, trade, in, the, entire, hudson, bay, basin, an, area, called, rupert, s, land, bioregional, political, organization, today, includes, agreements, of, states, e, g, international, treaties, and, within, the, us, interstate, compacts, or, other, political, entities, in, a, particular, drainage, basin, to, manage, the, body, or, bodies, of, water, into, which, it, drains, examples, of, such, interstate, compacts, are, the, great, lakes, commission, and, the, tahoe, regional, planning, agency, in, hydrology, the, drainage, basin, is, a, logical, unit, of, focus, for, studying, the, movement, of, water, within, the, hydrological, cycle, the, process, of, finding, a, drainage, boundary, is, referred, to, as, watershed, delineation, finding, the, area, and, extent, of, a, drainage, basin, is, an, important, step, in, many, areas, of, science, and, engineering, the, majority, of, water, that, discharges, from, the, basin, outlet, originated, as, precipitation, falling, on, the, basin, a, portion, of, the, water, that, enters, the, groundwater, system, beneath, the, drainage, basin, may, flow, towards, the, outlet, of, another, drainage, basin, because, groundwater, flow, directions, do, not, always, match, those, of, their, overlying, drainage, network, measurement, of, the, discharge, of, water, from, a, basin, may, be, made, by, a, stream, gauge, located, at, the, basin, s, outlet, depending, on, the, conditions, of, the, drainage, basin, as, rainfall, occurs, some, of, it, seeps, directly, into, the, ground, this, water, will, either, remain, underground, slowly, making, its, way, downhill, and, eventually, reaching, the, basin, or, it, will, permeate, deeper, into, the, soil, and, consolidate, into, groundwater, aquifers, as, water, flows, through, the, basin, it, can, form, tributaries, that, change, the, structure, of, the, land, there, are, three, different, main, types, which, are, affected, by, the, rocks, and, ground, underneath, rock, that, is, quick, to, erode, forms, dendritic, patterns, and, these, are, seen, most, often, the, two, other, types, of, patterns, that, form, are, trellis, patterns, and, rectangular, patterns, rain, gauge, data, is, used, to, measure, total, precipitation, over, a, drainage, basin, and, there, are, different, ways, to, interpret, that, data, if, the, gauges, are, many, and, evenly, distributed, over, an, area, of, uniform, precipitation, using, the, arithmetic, mean, method, will, give, good, results, in, the, thiessen, polygon, method, the, drainage, basin, is, divided, into, polygons, with, the, rain, gauge, in, the, middle, of, each, polygon, assumed, to, be, representative, for, the, rainfall, on, the, area, of, land, included, in, its, polygon, these, polygons, are, made, by, drawing, lines, between, gauges, then, making, perpendicular, bisectors, of, those, lines, form, the, polygons, the, isohyetal, method, involves, contours, of, equal, precipitation, are, drawn, over, the, gauges, on, a, map, calculating, the, area, between, these, curves, and, adding, up, the, volume, of, water, is, time, consuming, isochrone, maps, can, be, used, to, show, the, time, taken, for, runoff, water, within, a, drainage, basin, to, reach, a, lake, reservoir, or, outlet, assuming, constant, and, uniform, effective, rainfall, drainage, basins, are, the, principal, hydrologic, unit, considered, in, fluvial, geomorphology, a, drainage, basin, is, the, source, for, water, and, sediment, that, moves, from, higher, elevation, through, the, river, system, to, lower, elevations, as, they, reshape, the, channel, forms, drainage, basins, are, important, in, ecology, as, water, flows, over, the, ground, and, along, rivers, it, can, pick, up, nutrients, sediment, and, pollutants, with, the, water, they, are, transported, towards, the, outlet, of, the, basin, and, can, affect, the, ecological, processes, along, the, way, as, well, as, in, the, receiving, water, body, modern, use, of, artificial, fertilizers, containing, nitrogen, as, nitrates, phosphorus, and, potassium, has, affected, the, mouths, of, drainage, basins, the, minerals, are, carried, by, the, drainage, basin, to, the, mouth, and, may, accumulate, there, disturbing, the, natural, mineral, balance, this, can, cause, eutrophication, where, plant, growth, is, accelerated, by, the, additional, material, because, drainage, basins, are, coherent, entities, in, a, hydrological, sense, it, has, become, common, to, manage, water, resources, on, the, basis, of, individual, basins, in, the, u, s, state, of, minnesota, governmental, entities, that, perform, this, function, are, called, watershed, districts, in, new, zealand, they, are, called, catchment, boards, comparable, community, groups, based, in, ontario, canada, are, called, conservation, authorities, in, north, america, this, function, is, referred, to, as, watershed, management, in, brazil, the, national, policy, of, water, resources, regulated, by, act, n, 9, 433, of, 1997, establishes, the, drainage, basin, as, the, territorial, division, of, brazilian, water, management, when, a, river, basin, crosses, at, least, one, political, border, either, a, border, within, a, nation, or, an, international, boundary, it, is, identified, as, a, transboundary, river, management, of, such, basins, becomes, the, responsibility, of, the, countries, sharing, it, nile, basin, initiative, omvs, for, senegal, river, mekong, river, commission, are, a, few, examples, of, arrangements, involving, management, of, shared, river, basins, management, of, shared, drainage, basins, is, also, seen, as, a, way, to, build, lasting, peaceful, relationships, among, countries, the, catchment, is, the, most, significant, factor, determining, the, amount, or, likelihood, of, flooding, catchment, factors, are, topography, shape, size, soil, type, and, land, use, paved, or, roofed, areas, catchment, topography, and, shape, determine, the, time, taken, for, rain, to, reach, the, river, while, catchment, size, soil, type, and, development, determine, the, amount, of, water, to, reach, the, river, generally, topography, plays, a, big, part, in, how, fast, runoff, will, reach, a, river, rain, that, falls, in, steep, mountainous, areas, will, reach, the, primary, river, in, the, drainage, basin, faster, than, flat, or, lightly, sloping, areas, e, g, 1, gradient, shape, will, contribute, to, the, speed, with, which, the, runoff, reaches, a, river, a, long, thin, catchment, will, take, longer, to, drain, than, a, circular, catchment, size, will, help, determine, the, amount, of, water, reaching, the, river, as, the, larger, the, catchment, the, greater, the, potential, for, flooding, it, is, also, determined, on, the, basis, of, length, and, width, of, the, drainage, basin, soil, type, will, help, determine, how, much, water, reaches, the, river, the, runoff, from, the, drainage, area, is, dependent, on, the, soil, type, certain, soil, types, such, as, sandy, soils, are, very, free, draining, and, rainfall, on, sandy, soil, is, likely, to, be, absorbed, by, the, ground, however, soils, containing, clay, can, be, almost, impermeable, and, therefore, rainfall, on, clay, soils, will, run, off, and, contribute, to, flood, volumes, after, prolonged, rainfall, even, free, draining, soils, can, become, saturated, meaning, that, any, further, rainfall, will, reach, the, river, rather, than, being, absorbed, by, the, ground, if, the, surface, is, impermeable, the, precipitation, will, create, surface, run, off, which, will, lead, to, higher, risk, of, flooding, if, the, ground, is, permeable, the, precipitation, will, infiltrate, the, soil, land, use, can, contribute, to, the, volume, of, water, reaching, the, river, in, a, similar, way, to, clay, soils, for, example, rainfall, on, roofs, pavements, and, roads, will, be, collected, by, rivers, with, almost, no, absorption, into, the, groundwater, a, drainage, basin, is, an, area, of, land, where, all, flowing, surface, water, converges, to, a, single, point, such, as, a, river, mouth, or, flows, into, another, body, of, water, such, as, a, lake, or, ocean
