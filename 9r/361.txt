sulfur, also, spelled, sulphur, in, british, english, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, s, and, atomic, number, 16, it, is, abundant, multivalent, and, nonmetallic, under, normal, conditions, sulfur, atoms, form, cyclic, octatomic, molecules, with, the, chemical, formula, s, 8, elemental, sulfur, is, a, bright, yellow, crystalline, solid, at, room, temperature, sulfur, is, the, tenth, most, abundant, element, by, mass, in, the, universe, and, the, fifth, most, common, on, earth, though, sometimes, found, in, pure, native, form, sulfur, on, earth, usually, occurs, as, sulfide, and, sulfate, minerals, being, abundant, in, native, form, sulfur, was, known, in, ancient, times, being, mentioned, for, its, uses, in, ancient, india, ancient, greece, china, and, ancient, egypt, historically, and, in, literature, sulfur, is, also, called, brimstone, which, means, burning, stone, today, almost, all, elemental, sulfur, is, produced, as, a, byproduct, of, removing, sulfur, containing, contaminants, from, natural, gas, and, petroleum, the, greatest, commercial, use, of, the, element, is, the, production, of, sulfuric, acid, for, sulfate, and, phosphate, fertilizers, and, other, chemical, processes, sulfur, is, used, in, matches, insecticides, and, fungicides, many, sulfur, compounds, are, odoriferous, and, the, smells, of, odorized, natural, gas, skunk, scent, bad, breath, grapefruit, and, garlic, are, due, to, organosulfur, compounds, hydrogen, sulfide, gives, the, characteristic, odor, to, rotting, eggs, and, other, biological, processes, sulfur, is, an, essential, element, for, all, life, almost, always, in, the, form, of, organosulfur, compounds, or, metal, sulfides, amino, acids, two, proteinogenic, cysteine, and, methionine, and, many, other, non, coded, cystine, taurine, etc, and, two, vitamins, biotin, and, thiamine, are, organosulfur, compounds, crucial, for, life, many, cofactors, also, contain, sulfur, including, glutathione, and, iron, sulfur, proteins, disulfides, s, s, bonds, confer, mechanical, strength, and, insolubility, of, the, among, others, protein, keratin, found, in, outer, skin, hair, and, feathers, sulfur, is, one, of, the, core, chemical, elements, needed, for, biochemical, functioning, and, is, an, elemental, macronutrient, for, all, living, organisms, sulfur, forms, several, polyatomic, molecules, the, best, known, allotrope, is, octasulfur, cyclo, s, 8, the, point, group, of, cyclo, s, 8, is, d, 4d, and, its, dipole, moment, is, 0, d, octasulfur, is, a, soft, bright, yellow, solid, that, is, odorless, it, melts, at, 115, 21, c, 239, 38, f, boils, at, 444, 6, c, 832, 3, f, at, 95, 2, c, 203, 4, f, below, its, melting, temperature, cyclo, octasulfur, begins, slow, changing, from, octasulfur, to, the, polymorph, the, structure, of, the, s, 8, ring, is, virtually, unchanged, by, this, phase, change, which, affects, the, intermolecular, interactions, cooling, of, molten, sulfur, gives, freezing, point, in, 119, 6, c, 247, 3, f, as, it, predominantly, consists, of, the, s, 8, molecules, between, its, melting, and, boiling, temperatures, octasulfur, changes, its, allotrope, again, turning, from, octasulfur, to, sulfur, again, accompanied, by, a, lower, density, but, increased, viscosity, due, to, the, formation, of, polymers, at, higher, temperatures, the, viscosity, decreases, as, depolymerization, occurs, molten, sulfur, assumes, a, dark, red, color, above, 200, c, 392, f, the, density, of, sulfur, is, about, 2, g, cm, 3, depending, on, the, allotrope, all, of, the, stable, allotropes, are, excellent, electrical, insulators, sulfur, sublimes, more, or, less, between, 20, c, 68, f, and, 50, c, 122, f, sulfur, is, insoluble, in, water, but, soluble, in, carbon, disulfide, and, to, a, lesser, extent, in, other, nonpolar, organic, solvents, such, as, benzene, and, toluene, under, normal, conditions, sulfur, hydrolyzes, very, slowly, to, mainly, form, hydrogen, sulfide, and, sulfuric, acid, the, reaction, involves, adsorption, of, protons, onto, s, 8, clusters, followed, by, disproportionation, into, the, reaction, products, the, second, fourth, and, sixth, ionization, energies, of, sulfur, are, 2252, kj, mol, 4556, kj, mol, and, 8495, 8, kj, mol, respectively, a, composition, of, products, of, sulfur, s, reactions, with, oxidants, and, its, oxidation, state, depends, on, that, whether, releasing, out, of, a, reaction, energy, overcomes, these, thresholds, applying, catalysts, and, or, supply, of, outer, energy, may, vary, sulfur, s, oxidation, state, and, a, composition, of, reaction, products, while, reaction, between, sulfur, and, oxygen, at, normal, conditions, gives, sulfur, dioxide, oxidation, state, 4, formation, of, sulfur, trioxide, oxidation, state, 6, requires, temperature, 400, 600, c, 750, 1, 100, f, and, presence, of, a, catalyst, in, reactions, with, elements, of, lesser, electronegativity, it, reacts, as, an, oxidant, and, forms, sulfides, where, it, has, oxidation, state, 2, sulfur, reacts, with, nearly, all, other, elements, with, the, exception, of, the, noble, gases, even, with, the, notoriously, unreactive, metal, iridium, yielding, iridium, disulfide, some, of, those, reactions, need, elevated, temperatures, sulfur, forms, over, 30, solid, allotropes, more, than, any, other, element, besides, s, 8, several, other, rings, are, known, removing, one, atom, from, the, crown, gives, s, 7, which, is, of, a, deeper, yellow, than, s, 8, hplc, analysis, of, elemental, sulfur, reveals, an, equilibrium, mixture, of, mainly, s, 8, but, with, s, 7, and, small, amounts, of, s, 6, larger, rings, have, been, prepared, including, s, 12, and, s, 18, amorphous, or, plastic, sulfur, is, produced, by, rapid, cooling, of, molten, sulfur, for, example, by, pouring, it, into, cold, water, x, ray, crystallography, studies, show, that, the, amorphous, form, may, have, a, helical, structure, with, eight, atoms, per, turn, the, long, coiled, polymeric, molecules, make, the, brownish, substance, elastic, and, in, bulk, this, form, has, the, feel, of, crude, rubber, this, form, is, metastable, at, room, temperature, and, gradually, reverts, to, the, crystalline, molecular, allotrope, which, is, no, longer, elastic, this, process, happens, within, a, matter, of, hours, to, days, but, can, be, rapidly, catalyzed, sulfur, has, 23, known, isotopes, four, of, which, are, stable, 32, s, 94, 99, 0, 26, 33, s, 0, 75, 0, 02, 34, s, 4, 25, 0, 24, and, 36, s, 0, 01, 0, 01, other, than, 35, s, with, a, half, life, of, 87, days, the, radioactive, isotopes, of, sulfur, have, half, lives, less, than, 3, hours, the, preponderance, of, 32, s, is, explained, by, its, production, in, the, so, called, alpha, process, one, of, the, main, classes, of, nuclear, fusion, reactions, in, exploding, stars, other, stable, sulfur, isotopes, are, produced, in, the, bypass, processes, related, with, 34, ar, and, their, composition, depends, on, a, type, of, a, stellar, explosion, for, example, proportionally, more, 33, s, comes, from, novae, than, from, supernovae, on, the, planet, earth, the, sulfur, isotopic, composition, was, determined, by, the, sun, though, it, is, assumed, that, the, distribution, of, different, sulfur, isotopes, should, be, more, or, less, equal, it, has, been, found, that, proportions, of, two, most, abundant, sulfur, isotopes, 32, s, and, 34, s, varies, in, different, samples, assaying, of, these, isotopes, ratio, 34, s, in, the, samples, allows, to, make, suggestions, about, their, chemical, history, and, with, support, of, other, methods, it, allows, to, age, date, the, samples, estimate, temperature, of, equilibrium, between, ore, and, water, determine, ph, and, oxygen, fugacity, identify, the, activity, of, sulfate, reducing, bacteria, in, the, time, of, formation, of, the, sample, or, suggest, the, main, sources, of, sulfur, in, ecosystems, however, there, are, ongoing, discussions, about, what, is, the, real, reason, of, the, 34, s, shifts, biological, activity, or, postdeposital, alteration, for, example, when, sulfide, minerals, are, precipitated, isotopic, equilibration, among, solids, and, liquid, may, cause, small, differences, in, the, 34, s, values, of, co, genetic, minerals, the, differences, between, minerals, can, be, used, to, estimate, the, temperature, of, equilibration, the, 13, c, and, 34, s, of, coexisting, carbonate, minerals, and, sulfides, can, be, used, to, determine, the, ph, and, oxygen, fugacity, of, the, ore, bearing, fluid, during, ore, formation, scientists, measure, the, sulfur, isotopes, of, minerals, in, rocks, and, sediments, to, study, the, redox, conditions, in, the, oceans, in, the, past, sulfate, reducing, bacteria, in, marine, sediment, fractionate, sulfur, isotopes, as, they, take, in, sulfate, and, produce, sulfide, prior, to, the, 2010s, it, was, thought, that, sulfate, reduction, could, fractionate, sulfur, isotopes, up, to, 46, permil, and, fractionation, larger, than, 46, permil, recorded, in, sediments, must, be, due, to, disproportionation, of, sulfur, compounds, in, the, sediment, this, view, has, changed, since, the, 2010s, as, experiments, show, that, sulfate, reducing, bacteria, can, fractionate, to, 66, permil, as, substrates, for, disproportionation, are, limited, by, the, product, of, sulfate, reduction, the, isotopic, effect, of, disproportionation, should, be, less, than, 16, permil, in, most, sedimentary, settings, in, most, forest, ecosystems, sulfate, is, derived, mostly, from, the, atmosphere, weathering, of, ore, minerals, and, evaporites, contribute, some, sulfur, sulfur, with, a, distinctive, isotopic, composition, has, been, used, to, identify, pollution, sources, and, enriched, sulfur, has, been, added, as, a, tracer, in, hydrologic, studies, differences, in, the, natural, abundances, can, be, used, in, systems, where, there, is, sufficient, variation, in, the, 34, s, of, ecosystem, components, rocky, mountain, lakes, thought, to, be, dominated, by, atmospheric, sources, of, sulfate, have, been, found, to, have, measurably, different, 34, s, values, than, lakes, believed, to, be, dominated, by, watershed, sources, of, sulfate, the, radioactive, 35, s, is, formed, in, cosmic, ray, spallation, of, the, atmospheric, 40, ar, this, fact, may, be, used, for, proving, the, presence, of, recent, not, more, than, 1, year, atmospheric, sediments, in, various, things, this, isotope, may, be, obtained, artificially, by, different, ways, in, practice, the, reaction, 35, cl, n, 35, s, p, is, used, by, irradiating, potassium, chloride, with, neutrons, the, isotope, 35, s, is, used, in, various, sulfur, containing, compounds, as, a, radioactive, tracer, for, many, biological, studies, for, example, the, hershey, chase, experiment, because, of, the, weak, beta, activity, of, 35, s, its, compounds, are, relatively, safe, as, long, as, they, are, not, ingested, or, absorbed, by, the, body, 32, s, is, created, inside, massive, stars, at, a, depth, where, the, temperature, exceeds, 2, 5, 10, 9, k, by, the, fusion, of, one, nucleus, of, silicon, plus, one, nucleus, of, helium, as, this, nuclear, reaction, is, part, of, the, alpha, process, that, produces, elements, in, abundance, sulfur, is, the, 10th, most, common, element, in, the, universe, sulfur, usually, as, sulfide, is, present, in, many, types, of, meteorites, ordinary, chondrites, contain, on, average, 2, 1, sulfur, and, carbonaceous, chondrites, may, contain, as, much, as, 6, 6, it, is, normally, present, as, troilite, fes, but, there, are, exceptions, with, carbonaceous, chondrites, containing, free, sulfur, sulfates, and, other, sulfur, compounds, the, distinctive, colors, of, jupiter, s, volcanic, moon, io, are, attributed, to, various, forms, of, molten, solid, and, gaseous, sulfur, in, july, 2024, elemental, sulfur, was, confirmed, to, exist, on, mars, by, surprise, after, the, curiosity, rover, ran, over, and, crushed, a, rock, revealing, sulfur, crystals, inside, it, sulfur, is, the, fifth, most, common, element, by, mass, in, the, earth, elemental, sulfur, can, be, found, near, hot, springs, and, volcanic, regions, in, many, parts, of, the, world, especially, along, the, pacific, ring, of, fire, such, volcanic, deposits, are, currently, mined, in, indonesia, chile, and, japan, these, deposits, are, polycrystalline, with, the, largest, documented, single, crystal, measuring, 22, cm, 16, cm, 11, cm, 8, 7, in, 6, 3, in, 4, 3, in, historically, sicily, was, a, major, source, of, sulfur, in, the, industrial, revolution, lakes, of, molten, sulfur, up, to, about, 200, m, 660, ft, in, diameter, have, been, found, on, the, sea, floor, associated, with, submarine, volcanoes, at, depths, where, the, boiling, point, of, water, is, higher, than, the, melting, point, of, sulfur, native, sulfur, is, synthesized, by, anaerobic, bacteria, acting, on, sulfate, minerals, such, as, gypsum, in, salt, domes, significant, deposits, in, salt, domes, occur, along, the, coast, of, the, gulf, of, mexico, and, in, evaporites, in, eastern, europe, and, western, asia, native, sulfur, may, be, produced, by, geological, processes, alone, fossil, based, sulfur, deposits, from, salt, domes, were, once, the, basis, for, commercial, production, in, the, united, states, russia, turkmenistan, and, ukraine, currently, commercial, production, is, still, carried, out, in, the, osiek, mine, in, poland, such, sources, are, now, of, secondary, commercial, importance, and, most, are, no, longer, worked, common, naturally, occurring, sulfur, compounds, include, the, sulfide, minerals, such, as, pyrite, iron, sulfide, cinnabar, mercury, sulfide, galena, lead, sulfide, sphalerite, zinc, sulfide, and, stibnite, antimony, sulfide, and, the, sulfate, minerals, such, as, gypsum, calcium, sulfate, alunite, potassium, aluminium, sulfate, and, barite, barium, sulfate, on, earth, just, as, upon, jupiter, s, moon, io, elemental, sulfur, occurs, naturally, in, volcanic, emissions, including, emissions, from, hydrothermal, vents, the, main, industrial, source, of, sulfur, is, now, petroleum, and, natural, gas, common, oxidation, states, of, sulfur, range, from, 2, to, 6, sulfur, forms, stable, compounds, with, all, elements, except, the, noble, gases, sulfur, polycations, s, 2, 8, s, 2, 4, and, s, 2, 16, are, produced, when, sulfur, is, reacted, with, oxidizing, agents, in, a, strongly, acidic, solution, the, colored, solutions, produced, by, dissolving, sulfur, in, oleum, were, first, reported, as, early, as, 1804, by, c, f, bucholz, but, the, cause, of, the, color, and, the, structure, of, the, polycations, involved, was, only, determined, in, the, late, 1960s, s, 2, 8, is, deep, blue, s, 2, 4, is, yellow, and, s, 2, 16, is, red, reduction, of, sulfur, gives, various, polysulfides, with, the, formula, s, 2, x, many, of, which, have, been, obtained, in, crystalline, form, illustrative, is, the, production, of, sodium, tetrasulfide, some, of, these, dianions, dissociate, to, give, radical, anions, such, as, s, 3, gives, the, blue, color, of, the, rock, lapis, lazuli, this, reaction, highlights, a, distinctive, property, of, sulfur, its, ability, to, catenate, bind, to, itself, by, formation, of, chains, protonation, of, these, polysulfide, anions, produces, the, polysulfanes, h, 2, s, x, where, x, 2, 3, and, 4, ultimately, reduction, of, sulfur, produces, sulfide, salts, the, interconversion, of, these, species, is, exploited, in, the, sodium, sulfur, battery, treatment, of, sulfur, with, hydrogen, gives, hydrogen, sulfide, when, dissolved, in, water, hydrogen, sulfide, is, mildly, acidic, hydrogen, sulfide, gas, and, the, hydrosulfide, anion, are, extremely, toxic, to, mammals, due, to, their, inhibition, of, the, oxygen, carrying, capacity, of, hemoglobin, and, certain, cytochromes, in, a, manner, analogous, to, cyanide, and, azide, see, below, under, precautions, the, two, principal, sulfur, oxides, are, obtained, by, burning, sulfur, many, other, sulfur, oxides, are, observed, including, the, sulfur, rich, oxides, include, sulfur, monoxide, disulfur, monoxide, disulfur, dioxides, and, higher, oxides, containing, peroxo, groups, sulfur, reacts, with, fluorine, to, give, the, highly, reactive, sulfur, tetrafluoride, and, the, highly, inert, sulfur, hexafluoride, whereas, fluorine, gives, s, iv, and, s, vi, compounds, chlorine, gives, s, ii, and, s, i, derivatives, thus, sulfur, dichloride, disulfur, dichloride, and, higher, chlorosulfanes, arise, from, the, chlorination, of, sulfur, sulfuryl, chloride, and, chlorosulfuric, acid, are, derivatives, of, sulfuric, acid, thionyl, chloride, socl, 2, is, a, common, reagent, in, organic, synthesis, bromine, also, oxidizes, sulfur, to, form, sulfur, dibromide, and, disulfur, dibromide, sulfur, oxidizes, cyanide, and, sulfite, to, give, thiocyanate, and, thiosulfate, respectively, sulfur, reacts, with, many, metals, electropositive, metals, give, polysulfide, salts, copper, zinc, and, silver, are, attacked, by, sulfur, see, tarnishing, although, many, metal, sulfides, are, known, most, are, prepared, by, high, temperature, reactions, of, the, elements, geoscientists, also, study, the, isotopes, of, metal, sulfides, in, rocks, and, sediment, to, study, environmental, conditions, in, the, earth, s, past, some, of, the, main, classes, of, sulfur, containing, organic, compounds, include, the, following, compounds, with, carbon, sulfur, multiple, bonds, are, uncommon, an, exception, being, carbon, disulfide, a, volatile, colorless, liquid, that, is, structurally, similar, to, carbon, dioxide, it, is, used, as, a, reagent, to, make, the, polymer, rayon, and, many, organosulfur, compounds, unlike, carbon, monoxide, carbon, monosulfide, is, stable, only, as, an, extremely, dilute, gas, found, between, solar, systems, organosulfur, compounds, are, responsible, for, some, of, the, unpleasant, odors, of, decaying, organic, matter, they, are, widely, known, as, the, odorant, in, domestic, natural, gas, garlic, odor, and, skunk, spray, as, well, as, a, component, of, bad, breath, odor, not, all, organic, sulfur, compounds, smell, unpleasant, at, all, concentrations, the, sulfur, containing, monoterpenoid, grapefruit, mercaptan, in, small, concentrations, is, the, characteristic, scent, of, grapefruit, but, has, a, generic, thiol, odor, at, larger, concentrations, sulfur, mustard, a, potent, vesicant, was, used, in, world, war, i, as, a, disabling, agent, sulfur, sulfur, bonds, are, a, structural, component, used, to, stiffen, rubber, similar, to, the, disulfide, bridges, that, rigidify, proteins, see, biological, below, in, the, most, common, type, of, industrial, curing, or, hardening, and, strengthening, of, natural, rubber, elemental, sulfur, is, heated, with, the, rubber, to, the, point, that, chemical, reactions, form, disulfide, bridges, between, isoprene, units, of, the, polymer, this, process, patented, in, 1843, made, rubber, a, major, industrial, product, especially, in, automobile, tires, because, of, the, heat, and, sulfur, the, process, was, named, vulcanization, after, the, roman, god, of, the, forge, and, volcanism, being, abundantly, available, in, native, form, sulfur, was, known, in, ancient, times, and, is, referred, to, in, the, torah, genesis, english, translations, of, the, christian, bible, commonly, referred, to, burning, sulfur, as, brimstone, giving, rise, to, the, term, fire, and, brimstone, sermons, in, which, listeners, are, reminded, of, the, fate, of, eternal, damnation, that, await, the, unbelieving, and, unrepentant, it, is, from, this, part, of, the, bible, that, hell, is, implied, to, smell, of, sulfur, likely, due, to, its, association, with, volcanic, activity, according, to, the, ebers, papyrus, a, sulfur, ointment, was, used, in, ancient, egypt, to, treat, granular, eyelids, sulfur, was, used, for, fumigation, in, preclassical, greece, this, is, mentioned, in, the, odyssey, pliny, the, elder, discusses, sulfur, in, book, 35, of, his, natural, history, saying, that, its, best, known, source, is, the, island, of, melos, he, mentions, its, use, for, fumigation, medicine, and, bleaching, cloth, a, natural, form, of, sulfur, known, as, shiliuhuang, was, known, in, china, since, the, 6th, century, bc, and, found, in, hanzhong, by, the, 3rd, century, the, chinese, had, discovered, that, sulfur, could, be, extracted, from, pyrite, chinese, daoists, were, interested, in, sulfur, s, flammability, and, its, reactivity, with, certain, metals, yet, its, earliest, practical, uses, were, found, in, traditional, chinese, medicine, the, wujing, zongyao, of, 1044, ad, described, various, formulas, for, chinese, black, powder, which, is, a, mixture, of, potassium, nitrate, kno, 3, charcoal, and, sulfur, indian, alchemists, practitioners, of, the, science, of, chemicals, sanskrit, romanized, rasa, stra, wrote, extensively, about, the, use, of, sulfur, in, alchemical, operations, with, mercury, from, the, eighth, century, ad, onwards, in, the, rasa, stra, tradition, sulfur, is, called, the, smelly, gandhaka, early, european, alchemists, gave, sulfur, a, unique, alchemical, symbol, a, triangle, atop, a, cross, this, is, sometimes, confused, with, the, astronomical, crossed, spear, symbol, for, 2, pallas, the, variation, known, as, brimstone, has, a, symbol, combining, a, two, barred, cross, atop, a, lemniscate, in, traditional, skin, treatment, elemental, sulfur, was, used, mainly, in, creams, to, alleviate, such, conditions, as, scabies, ringworm, psoriasis, eczema, and, acne, the, mechanism, of, action, is, unknown, though, elemental, sulfur, does, oxidize, slowly, to, sulfurous, acid, which, is, through, the, action, of, sulfite, a, mild, reducing, and, antibacterial, agent, sulfur, appears, in, a, column, of, fixed, non, acidic, alkali, in, a, chemical, table, of, 1718, antoine, lavoisier, used, sulfur, in, combustion, experiments, writing, of, some, of, these, in, 1777, sulfur, deposits, in, sicily, were, the, dominant, source, for, more, than, a, century, by, the, late, 18th, century, about, 2, 000, tonnes, per, year, of, sulfur, were, imported, into, marseille, france, for, the, production, of, sulfuric, acid, for, use, in, the, leblanc, process, in, industrializing, britain, with, the, repeal, of, tariffs, on, salt, in, 1824, demand, for, sulfur, from, sicily, surged, upward, the, increasing, british, control, and, exploitation, of, the, mining, refining, and, transportation, of, the, sulfur, coupled, with, the, failure, of, this, lucrative, export, to, transform, sicily, s, backward, and, impoverished, economy, led, to, the, sulfur, crisis, of, 1840, when, king, ferdinand, ii, gave, a, monopoly, of, the, sulfur, industry, to, a, french, firm, violating, an, earlier, 1816, trade, agreement, with, britain, a, peaceful, solution, was, eventually, negotiated, by, france, in, 1867, elemental, sulfur, was, discovered, in, underground, deposits, in, louisiana, and, texas, the, highly, successful, frasch, process, was, developed, to, extract, this, resource, in, the, late, 18th, century, furniture, makers, used, molten, sulfur, to, produce, decorative, inlays, molten, sulfur, is, sometimes, still, used, for, setting, steel, bolts, into, drilled, concrete, holes, where, high, shock, resistance, is, desired, for, floor, mounted, equipment, attachment, points, pure, powdered, sulfur, was, used, as, a, medicinal, tonic, and, laxative, with, the, advent, of, the, contact, process, the, majority, of, sulfur, today, is, used, to, make, sulfuric, acid, for, a, wide, range, of, uses, particularly, fertilizer, in, recent, times, the, main, source, of, sulfur, has, become, petroleum, and, natural, gas, this, is, due, to, the, requirement, to, remove, sulfur, from, fuels, in, order, to, prevent, acid, rain, and, has, resulted, in, a, surplus, of, sulfur, sulfur, is, derived, from, the, latin, word, sulpur, which, was, hellenized, to, sulphur, in, the, erroneous, belief, that, the, latin, word, came, from, greek, this, spelling, was, later, reinterpreted, as, representing, an, f, sound, and, resulted, in, the, spelling, sulfur, which, appears, in, latin, toward, the, end, of, the, classical, period, the, true, ancient, greek, word, for, sulfur, the, on, from, earlier, th, eion, is, the, source, of, the, international, chemical, prefix, thio, the, modern, standard, greek, word, for, sulfur, is, the, o, in, 12th, century, anglo, french, it, was, sulfre, in, the, 14th, century, the, erroneously, hellenized, latin, ph, was, restored, in, middle, english, sulphre, by, the, 15th, century, both, full, latin, spelling, variants, sulfur, and, sulphur, became, common, in, english, the, parallel, f, ph, spellings, continued, in, britain, until, the, 19th, century, when, the, word, was, standardized, as, sulphur, on, the, other, hand, sulfur, was, the, form, chosen, in, the, united, states, whereas, canada, uses, both, the, iupac, adopted, the, spelling, sulfur, in, 1990, as, did, the, nomenclature, committee, of, the, royal, society, of, chemistry, in, 1992, restoring, the, spelling, sulfur, to, britain, oxford, dictionaries, note, that, in, chemistry, and, other, technical, uses, the, f, spelling, is, now, the, standard, form, for, this, and, related, words, in, british, as, well, as, us, contexts, and, is, increasingly, used, in, general, contexts, as, well, sulfur, may, be, found, by, itself, and, historically, was, usually, obtained, in, this, form, pyrite, has, also, been, a, source, of, sulfur, in, volcanic, regions, in, sicily, in, ancient, times, it, was, found, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, and, the, sicilian, process, was, used, sulfur, deposits, were, piled, and, stacked, in, brick, kilns, built, on, sloping, hillsides, with, airspaces, between, them, then, some, sulfur, was, pulverized, spread, over, the, stacked, ore, and, ignited, causing, the, free, sulfur, to, melt, down, the, hills, eventually, the, surface, borne, deposits, played, out, and, miners, excavated, veins, that, ultimately, dotted, the, sicilian, landscape, with, labyrinthine, mines, mining, was, unmechanized, and, labor, intensive, with, pickmen, freeing, the, ore, from, the, rock, and, mine, boys, or, carusi, carrying, baskets, of, ore, to, the, surface, often, through, a, mile, or, more, of, tunnels, once, the, ore, was, at, the, surface, it, was, reduced, and, extracted, in, smelting, ovens, the, conditions, in, sicilian, sulfur, mines, were, horrific, prompting, booker, t, washington, to, write, i, am, not, prepared, just, now, to, say, to, what, extent, i, believe, in, a, physical, hell, in, the, next, world, but, a, sulfur, mine, in, sicily, is, about, the, nearest, thing, to, hell, that, i, expect, to, see, in, this, life, sulfur, is, still, mined, from, surface, deposits, in, poorer, nations, with, volcanoes, such, as, indonesia, and, worker, conditions, have, not, improved, much, since, booker, t, washington, s, days, elemental, sulfur, was, extracted, from, salt, domes, in, which, it, sometimes, occurs, in, nearly, pure, form, until, the, late, 20th, century, sulfur, is, now, produced, as, a, side, product, of, other, industrial, processes, such, as, in, oil, refining, in, which, sulfur, is, undesired, as, a, mineral, native, sulfur, under, salt, domes, is, thought, to, be, a, fossil, mineral, resource, produced, by, the, action, of, anaerobic, bacteria, on, sulfate, deposits, it, was, removed, from, such, salt, dome, mines, mainly, by, the, frasch, process, in, this, method, superheated, water, was, pumped, into, a, native, sulfur, deposit, to, melt, the, sulfur, and, then, compressed, air, returned, the, 99, 5, pure, melted, product, to, the, surface, throughout, the, 20th, century, this, procedure, produced, elemental, sulfur, that, required, no, further, purification, due, to, a, limited, number, of, such, sulfur, deposits, and, the, high, cost, of, working, them, this, process, for, mining, sulfur, has, not, been, employed, in, a, major, way, anywhere, in, the, world, since, 2002, today, sulfur, is, produced, from, petroleum, natural, gas, and, related, fossil, resources, from, which, it, is, obtained, mainly, as, hydrogen, sulfide, organosulfur, compounds, undesirable, impurities, in, petroleum, may, be, upgraded, by, subjecting, them, to, hydrodesulfurization, which, cleaves, the, c, s, bonds, the, resulting, hydrogen, sulfide, from, this, process, and, also, as, it, occurs, in, natural, gas, is, converted, into, elemental, sulfur, by, the, claus, process, this, process, entails, oxidation, of, some, hydrogen, sulfide, to, sulfur, dioxide, and, then, the, comproportionation, of, the, two, owing, to, the, high, sulfur, content, of, the, athabasca, oil, sands, stockpiles, of, elemental, sulfur, from, this, process, now, exist, throughout, alberta, canada, another, way, of, storing, sulfur, is, as, a, binder, for, concrete, the, resulting, product, having, some, desirable, properties, see, sulfur, concrete, the, world, production, of, sulfur, in, 2011, amounted, to, 69, million, tonnes, mt, with, more, than, 15, countries, contributing, more, than, 1, mt, each, countries, producing, more, than, 5, mt, are, china, 9, 6, the, united, states, 8, 8, canada, 7, 1, and, russia, 7, 1, production, has, been, slowly, increasing, from, 1900, to, 2010, the, price, was, unstable, in, the, 1980s, and, around, 2010, elemental, sulfur, is, used, mainly, as, a, precursor, to, other, chemicals, approximately, 85, 1989, is, converted, to, sulfuric, acid, h, 2, so, 4, in, 2010, the, united, states, produced, more, sulfuric, acid, than, any, other, inorganic, industrial, chemical, the, principal, use, for, the, acid, is, the, extraction, of, phosphate, ores, for, the, production, of, fertilizer, manufacturing, other, applications, of, sulfuric, acid, include, oil, refining, wastewater, processing, and, mineral, extraction, sulfur, reacts, directly, with, methane, to, give, carbon, disulfide, which, is, used, to, manufacture, cellophane, and, rayon, one, of, the, uses, of, elemental, sulfur, is, in, vulcanization, of, rubber, where, polysulfide, chains, crosslink, organic, polymers, large, quantities, of, sulfites, are, used, to, bleach, paper, and, to, preserve, dried, fruit, many, surfactants, and, detergents, e, g, sodium, lauryl, sulfate, are, sulfate, derivatives, calcium, sulfate, gypsum, caso, 4, 2h, 2, o, is, mined, on, the, scale, of, 100, million, tonnes, each, year, for, use, in, portland, cement, and, fertilizers, when, silver, based, photography, was, widespread, sodium, and, ammonium, thiosulfate, were, widely, used, as, fixing, agents, sulfur, is, a, component, of, gunpowder, black, powder, amino, acids, synthesized, by, living, organisms, such, as, methionine, and, cysteine, contain, organosulfur, groups, thioester, and, thiol, respectively, the, antioxidant, glutathione, protecting, many, living, organisms, against, free, radicals, and, oxidative, stress, also, contains, organic, sulfur, some, crops, such, as, onion, and, garlic, also, produce, different, organosulfur, compounds, such, as, syn, propanethial, s, oxide, responsible, of, lacrymal, irritation, onions, or, diallyl, disulfide, and, allicin, garlic, sulfates, commonly, found, in, soils, and, groundwaters, are, often, a, sufficient, natural, source, of, sulfur, for, plants, and, bacteria, atmospheric, deposition, of, sulfur, dioxide, so, 2, is, also, a, common, artificial, source, coal, combustion, of, sulfur, for, the, soils, under, normal, circumstances, in, most, agricultural, soils, sulfur, is, not, a, limiting, nutrient, for, plants, and, microorganisms, see, liebig, s, barrel, however, in, some, circumstances, soils, can, be, depleted, in, sulfate, e, g, if, this, later, is, leached, by, meteoric, water, rain, or, if, the, requirements, in, sulfur, for, some, types, of, crops, are, high, this, explains, that, sulfur, is, increasingly, recognized, and, used, as, a, component, of, fertilizers, the, most, important, form, of, sulfur, for, fertilizer, is, calcium, sulfate, commonly, found, in, nature, as, the, mineral, gypsum, caso, 4, 2h, 2, o, elemental, sulfur, is, hydrophobic, not, soluble, in, water, and, cannot, be, used, directly, by, plants, elemental, sulfur, es, is, sometimes, mixed, with, bentonite, to, amend, depleted, soils, for, crops, with, high, requirement, in, organo, sulfur, over, time, oxidation, abiotic, processes, with, atmospheric, oxygen, and, soil, bacteria, can, oxidize, and, convert, elemental, sulfur, to, soluble, derivatives, which, can, then, be, used, by, microorganisms, and, plants, sulfur, improves, the, efficiency, of, other, essential, plant, nutrients, particularly, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, biologically, produced, sulfur, particles, are, naturally, hydrophilic, due, to, a, biopolymer, coating, and, are, easier, to, disperse, over, the, land, in, a, spray, of, diluted, slurry, resulting, in, a, faster, uptake, by, plants, the, plants, requirement, for, sulfur, equals, or, exceeds, the, requirement, for, phosphorus, it, is, an, essential, nutrient, for, plant, growth, root, nodule, formation, of, legumes, and, immunity, and, defense, systems, sulfur, deficiency, has, become, widespread, in, many, countries, in, europe, because, atmospheric, inputs, of, sulfur, continue, to, decrease, the, deficit, in, the, sulfur, input, output, is, likely, to, increase, unless, sulfur, fertilizers, are, used, atmospheric, inputs, of, sulfur, decrease, because, of, actions, taken, to, limit, acid, rains, elemental, sulfur, is, one, of, the, oldest, fungicides, and, pesticides, dusting, sulfur, elemental, sulfur, in, powdered, form, is, a, common, fungicide, for, grapes, strawberry, many, vegetables, and, several, other, crops, it, has, a, good, efficacy, against, a, wide, range, of, powdery, mildew, diseases, as, well, as, black, spot, in, organic, production, sulfur, is, the, most, important, fungicide, it, is, the, only, fungicide, used, in, organically, farmed, apple, production, against, the, main, disease, apple, scab, under, colder, conditions, biosulfur, biologically, produced, elemental, sulfur, with, hydrophilic, characteristics, can, also, be, used, for, these, applications, standard, formulation, dusting, sulfur, is, applied, to, crops, with, a, sulfur, duster, or, from, a, dusting, plane, wettable, sulfur, is, the, commercial, name, for, dusting, sulfur, formulated, with, additional, ingredients, to, make, it, water, miscible, it, has, similar, applications, and, is, used, as, a, fungicide, against, mildew, and, other, mold, related, problems, with, plants, and, soil, elemental, sulfur, powder, is, used, as, an, organic, i, e, green, insecticide, actually, an, acaricide, against, ticks, and, mites, a, common, method, of, application, is, dusting, the, clothing, or, limbs, with, sulfur, powder, a, diluted, solution, of, lime, sulfur, made, by, combining, calcium, hydroxide, with, elemental, sulfur, in, water, is, used, as, a, dip, for, pets, to, destroy, ringworm, fungus, mange, and, other, dermatoses, and, parasites, sulfur, candles, of, almost, pure, sulfur, were, burned, to, fumigate, structures, and, wine, barrels, but, are, now, considered, too, toxic, for, residences, sulfur, specifically, octasulfur, s, 8, is, used, in, pharmaceutical, skin, preparations, for, the, treatment, of, acne, and, other, conditions, it, acts, as, a, keratolytic, agent, and, also, kills, bacteria, fungi, scabies, mites, and, other, parasites, precipitated, sulfur, and, colloidal, sulfur, are, used, in, form, of, lotions, creams, powders, soaps, and, bath, additives, for, the, treatment, of, acne, vulgaris, acne, rosacea, and, seborrhoeic, dermatitis, many, drugs, contain, sulfur, early, examples, include, antibacterial, sulfonamides, known, as, sulfa, drugs, a, more, recent, example, is, mucolytic, acetylcysteine, sulfur, is, a, part, of, many, bacterial, defense, molecules, most, lactam, antibiotics, including, the, penicillins, cephalosporins, and, monobactams, contain, sulfur, due, to, their, high, energy, density, and, the, availability, of, sulfur, there, is, ongoing, research, in, creating, rechargeable, lithium, sulfur, batteries, until, now, carbonate, electrolytes, have, caused, failures, in, such, batteries, after, a, single, cycle, in, february, 2022, researchers, at, drexel, university, have, not, only, created, a, prototypical, battery, that, lasted, 4000, recharge, cycles, but, also, found, the, first, monoclinic, gamma, sulfur, that, remained, stable, below, 95, degrees, celsius, sulfur, is, an, essential, component, of, all, living, cells, it, is, the, eighth, most, abundant, element, in, the, human, body, by, weight, about, equal, in, abundance, to, potassium, and, slightly, greater, than, sodium, and, chlorine, a, 70, kg, 150, lb, human, body, contains, about, 140, grams, 4, 9, oz, of, sulfur, the, main, dietary, source, of, sulfur, for, humans, is, sulfur, containing, amino, acids, which, can, be, found, in, plant, and, animal, proteins, in, the, 1880s, while, studying, beggiatoa, a, bacterium, living, in, a, sulfur, rich, environment, sergei, winogradsky, found, that, it, oxidized, hydrogen, sulfide, h, 2, s, as, an, energy, source, forming, intracellular, sulfur, droplets, winogradsky, referred, to, this, form, of, metabolism, as, inorgoxidation, oxidation, of, inorganic, compounds, another, contributor, who, continued, to, study, it, was, selman, waksman, primitive, bacteria, that, live, around, deep, ocean, volcanic, vents, oxidize, hydrogen, sulfide, for, their, nutrition, as, discovered, by, robert, ballard, sulfur, oxidizers, can, use, as, energy, sources, reduced, sulfur, compounds, including, hydrogen, sulfide, elemental, sulfur, sulfite, thiosulfate, and, various, polythionates, e, g, tetrathionate, they, depend, on, enzymes, such, as, sulfur, oxygenase, and, sulfite, oxidase, to, oxidize, sulfur, to, sulfate, some, lithotrophs, can, even, use, the, energy, contained, in, sulfur, compounds, to, produce, sugars, a, process, known, as, chemosynthesis, some, bacteria, and, archaea, use, hydrogen, sulfide, in, place, of, water, as, the, electron, donor, in, chemosynthesis, a, process, similar, to, photosynthesis, that, produces, sugars, and, uses, oxygen, as, the, electron, acceptor, sulfur, based, chemosynthesis, may, be, simplifiedly, compared, with, photosynthesis, there, are, bacteria, combining, these, two, ways, of, nutrition, green, sulfur, bacteria, and, purple, sulfur, bacteria, also, sulfur, oxidizing, bacteria, can, go, into, symbiosis, with, larger, organisms, enabling, the, later, to, use, hydrogen, sulfide, as, food, to, be, oxidized, example, the, giant, tube, worm, there, are, sulfate, reducing, bacteria, that, by, contrast, breathe, sulfate, instead, of, oxygen, they, use, organic, compounds, or, molecular, hydrogen, as, the, energy, source, they, use, sulfur, as, the, electron, acceptor, and, reduce, various, oxidized, sulfur, compounds, back, into, sulfide, often, into, hydrogen, sulfide, they, can, grow, on, other, partially, oxidized, sulfur, compounds, e, g, thiosulfates, thionates, polysulfides, sulfites, there, are, studies, pointing, that, many, deposits, of, native, sulfur, in, places, that, were, the, bottom, of, the, ancient, oceans, have, biological, origin, these, studies, indicate, that, this, native, sulfur, have, been, obtained, through, biological, activity, but, what, is, responsible, for, that, sulfur, oxidizing, bacteria, or, sulfate, reducing, bacteria, is, still, unknown, for, sure, sulfur, is, absorbed, by, plants, roots, from, soil, as, sulfate, and, transported, as, a, phosphate, ester, sulfate, is, reduced, to, sulfide, via, sulfite, before, it, is, incorporated, into, cysteine, and, other, organosulfur, compounds, while, the, plants, role, in, transferring, sulfur, to, animals, by, food, chains, is, more, or, less, understood, the, role, of, sulfur, bacteria, is, just, getting, investigated, in, all, forms, of, life, most, of, the, sulfur, is, contained, in, two, proteinogenic, amino, acids, cysteine, and, methionine, thus, the, element, is, present, in, all, proteins, that, contain, these, amino, acids, as, well, as, in, respective, peptides, some, of, the, sulfur, is, comprised, in, certain, metabolites, many, of, which, are, cofactors, and, sulfated, polysaccharides, of, connective, tissue, chondroitin, sulfates, heparin, proteins, to, execute, their, biological, function, need, to, have, specific, space, geometry, formation, of, this, geometry, is, performed, in, a, process, called, protein, folding, and, is, provided, by, intra, and, inter, molecular, bonds, the, process, has, several, stages, while, at, premier, stages, a, polypeptide, chain, folds, due, to, hydrogen, bonds, at, later, stages, folding, is, provided, apart, from, hydrogen, bonds, by, covalent, bonds, between, two, sulfur, atoms, of, two, cysteine, residues, so, called, disulfide, bridges, at, different, places, of, a, chain, tertiary, protein, structure, as, well, as, between, two, cysteine, residues, in, two, separated, protein, subunits, quaternary, protein, structure, both, structures, easily, may, be, seen, in, insulin, as, the, bond, energy, of, a, covalent, disulfide, bridge, is, higher, than, the, energy, of, a, coordinate, bond, or, hydrophobic, interaction, higher, disulfide, bridges, content, leads, to, higher, energy, needed, for, protein, denaturation, in, general, disulfide, bonds, are, necessary, in, proteins, functioning, outside, cellular, space, and, they, do, not, change, proteins, conformation, geometry, but, serve, as, its, stabilizers, within, cytoplasm, cysteine, residues, of, proteins, are, saved, in, reduced, state, i, e, in, sh, form, by, thioredoxins, this, property, manifests, in, following, examples, lysozyme, is, stable, enough, to, be, applied, as, a, drug, feathers, and, hair, have, relative, strength, and, consisting, in, them, keratin, is, considered, indigestible, by, most, organisms, however, there, are, fungi, and, bacteria, containing, keratinase, and, are, able, to, destruct, keratin, many, important, cellular, enzymes, use, prosthetic, groups, ending, with, sh, moieties, to, handle, reactions, involving, acyl, containing, biochemicals, two, common, examples, from, basic, metabolism, are, coenzyme, a, and, alpha, lipoic, acid, cysteine, related, metabolites, homocysteine, and, taurine, are, other, sulfur, containing, amino, acids, that, are, similar, in, structure, but, not, coded, by, dna, and, are, not, part, of, the, primary, structure, of, proteins, take, part, in, various, locations, of, mammalian, physiology, two, of, the, 13, classical, vitamins, biotin, and, thiamine, contain, sulfur, and, serve, as, cofactors, to, several, enzymes, in, intracellular, chemistry, sulfur, operates, as, a, carrier, of, reducing, hydrogen, and, its, electrons, for, cellular, repair, of, oxidation, reduced, glutathione, a, sulfur, containing, tripeptide, is, a, reducing, agent, through, its, sulfhydryl, sh, moiety, derived, from, cysteine, methanogenesis, the, route, to, most, of, the, world, s, methane, is, a, multistep, biochemical, transformation, of, carbon, dioxide, this, conversion, requires, several, organosulfur, cofactors, these, include, coenzyme, m, ch, 3, sch, 2, ch, 2, so, 3, the, immediate, precursor, to, methane, metalloproteins, in, which, the, active, site, is, a, transition, metal, ion, or, metal, sulfide, cluster, often, coordinated, by, sulfur, atoms, of, cysteine, residues, are, essential, components, of, enzymes, involved, in, electron, transfer, processes, examples, include, plastocyanin, cu, 2, and, nitrous, oxide, reductase, cu, s, the, function, of, these, enzymes, is, dependent, on, the, fact, that, the, transition, metal, ion, can, undergo, redox, reactions, other, examples, include, many, zinc, proteins, as, well, as, iron, sulfur, clusters, most, pervasive, are, the, ferrodoxins, which, serve, as, electron, shuttles, in, cells, in, bacteria, the, important, nitrogenase, enzymes, contain, an, fe, mo, s, cluster, and, is, a, catalyst, that, performs, the, important, function, of, nitrogen, fixation, converting, atmospheric, nitrogen, to, ammonia, that, can, be, used, by, microorganisms, and, plants, to, make, proteins, dna, rna, alkaloids, and, the, other, organic, nitrogen, compounds, necessary, for, life, sulfur, is, also, present, in, molybdenum, cofactor, in, humans, methionine, is, an, essential, amino, acid, cysteine, is, conditionally, essential, and, may, be, synthesized, from, non, essential, serine, sulfur, donor, would, be, methionine, in, this, case, dietary, deficiency, rarely, happens, in, common, conditions, artificial, methionine, deficiency, is, attempted, to, apply, in, cancer, treatment, but, the, method, is, still, potentially, dangerous, isolated, sulfite, oxidase, deficiency, is, a, rare, fatal, genetic, disease, preventing, production, of, sulfite,
