messier, 87, also, known, as, virgo, a, or, ngc, 4486, generally, abbreviated, to, m87, is, a, supergiant, elliptical, galaxy, in, the, constellation, virgo, that, contains, several, trillion, stars, one, of, the, largest, and, most, massive, galaxies, in, the, local, universe, it, has, a, large, population, of, globular, clusters, about, 15, 000, compared, with, the, 150, 200, orbiting, the, milky, way, and, a, jet, of, energetic, plasma, that, originates, at, the, core, and, extends, at, least, 1, 500, parsecs, 4, 900, light, years, traveling, at, a, relativistic, speed, it, is, one, of, the, brightest, radio, sources, in, the, sky, and, a, popular, target, for, both, amateur, and, professional, astronomers, the, french, astronomer, charles, messier, discovered, m87, in, 1781, and, cataloged, it, as, a, nebula, m87, is, about, 16, 4, million, parsecs, 53, million, light, years, from, earth, and, is, the, second, brightest, galaxy, within, the, northern, virgo, cluster, having, many, satellite, galaxies, unlike, a, disk, shaped, spiral, galaxy, m87, has, no, distinctive, dust, lanes, instead, it, has, an, almost, featureless, ellipsoidal, shape, typical, of, most, giant, elliptical, galaxies, diminishing, in, luminosity, with, distance, from, the, center, forming, around, one, sixth, of, its, mass, m87, s, stars, have, a, nearly, spherically, symmetric, distribution, their, population, density, decreases, with, increasing, distance, from, the, core, it, has, an, active, supermassive, black, hole, at, its, core, which, forms, the, primary, component, of, an, active, galactic, nucleus, the, black, hole, was, imaged, using, data, collected, in, 2017, by, the, event, horizon, telescope, eht, with, a, final, processed, image, released, on, 10, april, 2019, in, march, 2021, the, eht, collaboration, presented, for, the, first, time, a, polarized, based, image, of, the, black, hole, which, may, help, better, reveal, the, forces, giving, rise, to, quasars, the, galaxy, is, a, strong, source, of, multi, wavelength, radiation, particularly, radio, waves, it, has, an, isophotal, diameter, of, 40, 55, kiloparsecs, 132, 000, light, years, with, a, diffuse, galactic, envelope, that, extends, to, a, radius, of, about, 150, kiloparsecs, 490, 000, light, years, where, it, is, truncated, possibly, by, an, encounter, with, another, galaxy, its, interstellar, medium, consists, of, diffuse, gas, enriched, by, elements, emitted, from, evolved, stars, in, 1781, the, french, astronomer, charles, messier, published, a, catalogue, of, 103, objects, that, had, a, nebulous, appearance, as, part, of, a, list, intended, to, identify, objects, that, might, otherwise, be, confused, with, comets, in, subsequent, use, each, catalogue, entry, was, prefixed, with, an, m, thus, m87, was, the, eighty, seventh, object, listed, in, messier, s, catalogue, during, the, 1880s, the, object, was, included, as, ngc, 4486, in, the, new, general, catalogue, of, nebulae, and, star, clusters, assembled, by, the, danish, irish, astronomer, john, dreyer, which, he, based, primarily, on, the, observations, of, the, english, astronomer, john, herschel, in, 1918, the, american, astronomer, heber, curtis, of, lick, observatory, noted, m87, s, lack, of, a, spiral, structure, and, observed, a, curious, straight, ray, apparently, connected, with, the, nucleus, by, a, thin, line, of, matter, the, ray, appeared, brightest, near, the, galactic, center, the, following, year, supernova, sn, 1919a, within, m87, reached, a, peak, photographic, magnitude, of, 11, 5, although, this, event, was, not, reported, until, photographic, plates, were, examined, by, the, russian, astronomer, innokentii, a, balanowski, in, 1922, in, 1922, the, american, astronomer, edwin, hubble, categorized, m87, as, one, of, the, brighter, globular, nebulae, as, it, lacked, any, spiral, structure, but, like, spiral, nebulae, appeared, to, belong, to, the, family, of, non, galactic, nebulae, in, 1926, he, produced, a, new, categorization, distinguishing, extragalactic, from, galactic, nebulae, the, former, being, independent, star, systems, m87, was, classified, as, a, type, of, elliptical, extragalactic, nebula, with, no, apparent, elongation, class, e0, in, 1931, hubble, described, m87, as, a, member, of, the, virgo, cluster, and, gave, a, provisional, estimate, of, 1, 8, million, parsecs, 5, 9, million, light, years, from, earth, it, was, then, the, only, known, elliptical, nebula, for, which, individual, stars, could, be, resolved, although, it, was, pointed, out, that, globular, clusters, would, be, indistinguishable, from, individual, stars, at, such, distances, in, his, 1936, the, realm, of, the, nebulae, hubble, examines, the, terminology, of, the, day, some, astronomers, labeled, extragalactic, nebulae, as, external, galaxies, on, the, basis, that, they, were, stellar, systems, at, far, distances, from, our, own, galaxy, while, others, preferred, the, conventional, term, extragalactic, nebulae, as, galaxy, was, at, that, time, a, synonym, for, the, milky, way, m87, continued, to, be, labelled, as, an, extragalactic, nebula, at, least, until, 1954, in, 1947, a, prominent, radio, source, virgo, a, was, identified, with, errors, in, its, measured, position, that, overlapped, the, location, of, m87, the, source, was, confirmed, to, be, m87, by, 1953, and, the, linear, relativistic, jet, emerging, from, the, core, of, the, galaxy, was, suggested, as, the, cause, this, jet, extended, from, the, core, at, a, position, angle, of, 260, to, an, angular, distance, of, 20, with, an, angular, width, of, 2, in, 1969, 1970, a, strong, component, of, the, radio, emission, was, found, to, closely, align, with, the, optical, source, of, the, jet, in, 1966, the, united, states, naval, research, laboratory, s, aerobee, 150, rocket, identified, virgo, x, 1, the, first, x, ray, source, in, virgo, the, aerobee, rocket, launched, from, white, sands, missile, range, on, 7, july, 1967, yielded, further, evidence, that, the, source, of, virgo, x, 1, was, the, radio, galaxy, m87, subsequent, x, ray, observations, by, the, heao, 1, and, einstein, observatory, showed, a, complex, source, that, included, the, active, galactic, nucleus, of, m87, however, there, is, little, central, concentration, of, the, x, ray, emission, m87, has, been, an, important, testing, ground, for, techniques, that, measure, the, masses, of, central, supermassive, black, holes, in, galaxies, in, 1978, stellar, dynamical, modeling, of, the, mass, distribution, in, m87, gave, evidence, for, a, central, mass, of, five, billion, m, solar, masses, after, the, installation, of, the, costar, corrective, optics, module, in, the, hubble, space, telescope, in, 1993, the, hubble, faint, object, spectrograph, fos, was, used, to, measure, the, rotation, velocity, of, the, ionized, gas, disk, at, the, center, of, m87, as, an, early, release, observation, designed, to, test, the, scientific, performance, of, the, post, repair, hubble, instruments, the, fos, data, indicated, a, central, black, hole, mass, of, 2, 4, billion, m, with, 30, uncertainty, globular, clusters, within, m87, have, been, used, to, calibrate, metallicity, relations, as, well, m87, was, observed, by, the, event, horizon, telescope, eht, during, much, of, 2017, the, event, horizon, of, the, black, hole, at, the, center, was, directly, imaged, by, the, eht, then, revealed, in, a, press, conference, on, the, issue, date, stated, filtering, out, from, this, the, first, image, of, a, black, hole, s, shadow, m87, is, near, a, high, declination, limit, of, the, virgo, constellation, abutting, coma, berenices, it, lies, along, the, line, between, the, stars, epsilon, virginis, and, denebola, beta, leonis, the, galaxy, can, be, observed, using, a, small, telescope, with, a, 6, cm, 2, 4, in, aperture, extending, across, an, angular, area, of, 7, 2, 6, 8, arcminutes, at, a, surface, brightness, of, 12, 9, with, a, very, bright, 45, arcsecond, core, viewing, the, jet, is, a, challenge, without, the, aid, of, photography, before, 1991, the, ukrainian, american, astronomer, otto, struve, was, the, only, person, known, to, have, seen, the, jet, visually, using, the, 254, cm, 100, in, hooker, telescope, in, more, recent, years, it, has, been, observed, in, larger, amateur, telescopes, under, excellent, conditions, in, the, modified, hubble, sequence, galaxy, morphological, classification, scheme, of, the, french, astronomer, g, rard, de, vaucouleurs, m87, is, categorized, as, an, e0p, galaxy, e0, designates, an, elliptical, galaxy, that, displays, no, flattening, that, is, it, appears, spherical, a, p, suffix, indicates, a, peculiar, galaxy, that, does, not, fit, cleanly, into, the, classification, scheme, in, this, case, the, peculiarity, is, the, presence, of, the, jet, emerging, from, the, core, in, the, yerkes, morgan, scheme, m87, is, classified, as, a, type, cd, galaxy, a, d, galaxy, has, an, elliptical, like, nucleus, surrounded, by, an, extensive, dustless, diffuse, envelope, a, d, type, supergiant, is, called, a, cd, galaxy, the, distance, to, m87, has, been, estimated, using, several, independent, techniques, these, include, measurement, of, the, luminosity, of, planetary, nebulae, comparison, with, nearby, galaxies, whose, distance, is, estimated, using, standard, candles, such, as, cepheid, variables, the, linear, size, distribution, of, globular, clusters, and, the, tip, of, the, red, giant, branch, method, using, individually, resolved, red, giant, stars, these, measurements, are, consistent, with, each, other, and, their, weighted, average, yields, a, distance, estimate, of, 16, 4, 0, 5, megaparsecs, 53, 5, 1, 63, million, light, years, m87, is, one, of, the, most, massive, galaxies, in, the, local, universe, its, diameter, is, estimated, at, 132, 000, light, years, which, is, approximately, 51, larger, than, that, of, the, milky, way, as, an, elliptical, galaxy, the, galaxy, is, a, spheroid, rather, than, a, flattened, disc, accounting, for, the, substantially, larger, mass, of, m87, within, a, radius, of, 32, kiloparsecs, 100, 000, light, years, the, mass, is, 2, 4, 0, 6, 10, 12, times, the, mass, of, the, sun, which, is, double, the, mass, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, as, with, other, galaxies, only, a, fraction, of, this, mass, is, in, the, form, of, stars, m87, has, an, estimated, mass, to, luminosity, ratio, of, 6, 3, 0, 8, that, is, only, about, one, part, in, six, of, the, galaxy, s, mass, is, in, the, form, of, stars, that, radiate, energy, this, ratio, varies, from, 5, to, 30, approximately, in, proportion, to, r, 1, 7, in, the, region, of, 9, 40, kiloparsecs, 29, 000, 130, 000, light, years, from, the, core, the, total, mass, of, m87, may, be, 200, times, that, of, the, milky, way, the, galaxy, experiences, an, infall, of, gas, at, the, rate, of, two, to, three, solar, masses, per, year, most, of, which, may, be, accreted, onto, the, core, region, the, extended, stellar, envelope, of, this, galaxy, reaches, a, radius, of, about, 150, kiloparsecs, 490, 000, light, years, compared, with, about, 100, kiloparsecs, 330, 000, light, years, for, the, milky, way, beyond, that, distance, the, outer, edge, of, the, galaxy, has, been, truncated, by, some, means, possibly, by, an, earlier, encounter, with, another, galaxy, there, is, evidence, of, linear, streams, of, stars, to, the, northwest, of, the, galaxy, which, may, have, been, created, by, tidal, stripping, of, orbiting, galaxies, or, by, small, satellite, galaxies, falling, in, toward, m87, moreover, a, filament, of, hot, ionized, gas, in, the, northeastern, outer, part, of, the, galaxy, may, be, the, remnant, of, a, small, gas, rich, galaxy, that, was, disrupted, by, m87, and, could, be, feeding, its, active, nucleus, m87, is, estimated, to, have, at, least, 50, satellite, galaxies, including, ngc, 4486b, and, ngc, 4478, the, spectrum, of, the, nuclear, region, of, m87, shows, the, emission, lines, of, various, ions, including, hydrogen, hi, hii, helium, hei, oxygen, oi, oii, oiii, nitrogen, ni, magnesium, mgii, and, sulfur, sii, the, line, intensities, for, weakly, ionized, atoms, such, as, neutral, atomic, oxygen, oi, are, stronger, than, those, of, strongly, ionized, atoms, such, as, doubly, ionized, oxygen, oiii, a, galactic, nucleus, with, such, spectral, properties, is, termed, a, liner, for, low, ionization, nuclear, emission, line, region, the, mechanism, and, source, of, weak, line, dominated, ionization, in, liners, and, m87, are, under, debate, possible, causes, include, shock, induced, excitation, in, the, outer, parts, of, the, disk, or, photoionization, in, the, inner, region, powered, by, the, jet, elliptical, galaxies, such, as, m87, are, believed, to, form, as, the, result, of, one, or, more, mergers, of, smaller, galaxies, they, generally, contain, relatively, little, cold, interstellar, gas, in, comparison, with, spiral, galaxies, and, they, are, populated, mostly, by, old, stars, with, little, or, no, ongoing, star, formation, m87, s, elliptical, shape, is, maintained, by, the, random, orbital, motions, of, its, constituent, stars, in, contrast, to, the, more, orderly, rotational, motions, found, in, a, spiral, galaxy, such, as, the, milky, way, using, the, very, large, telescope, to, study, the, motions, of, about, 300, planetary, nebulae, astronomers, have, determined, that, m87, absorbed, a, medium, sized, star, forming, spiral, galaxy, over, the, last, billion, years, this, has, resulted, in, the, addition, of, some, younger, bluer, stars, to, m87, the, distinctive, spectral, properties, of, the, planetary, nebulae, allowed, astronomers, to, discover, a, chevron, like, structure, in, m87, s, halo, which, was, produced, by, the, incomplete, phase, space, mixing, of, a, disrupted, galaxy, the, core, of, the, galaxy, contains, a, supermassive, black, hole, smbh, designated, m87, whose, mass, is, billions, of, times, that, of, the, earth, s, sun, estimates, had, ranged, from, 3, 5, 0, 8, 10, 9, m, to, 6, 6, 0, 4, 10, 9, m, surpassed, by, 7, 22, 0, 34, 0, 40, 10, 9, m, in, 2016, in, april, 2019, the, event, horizon, telescope, collaboration, released, measurements, of, the, black, hole, s, mass, as, 6, 5, 0, 2, stat, 0, 7, sys, 10, 9, m, this, is, one, of, the, highest, known, masses, for, such, an, object, a, rotating, disk, of, ionized, gas, surrounds, the, black, hole, and, is, roughly, perpendicular, to, the, relativistic, jet, the, disk, rotates, at, velocities, of, up, to, roughly, 1, 000, km, s, 2, 200, 000, mph, and, spans, a, maximum, diameter, of, 25, 000, au, 3, 7, trillion, km, 2, 3, trillion, mi, by, comparison, pluto, averages, 39, au, 5, 8, billion, km, 3, 6, billion, mi, from, the, sun, gas, accretes, onto, the, black, hole, at, an, estimated, rate, of, one, solar, mass, every, ten, years, about, 90, earth, masses, per, day, the, schwarzschild, radius, of, the, black, hole, is, 120, au, 18, billion, kilometres, 11, billion, miles, the, diameter, of, the, accretion, disk, as, seen, from, earth, is, 42, as, microarcsecond, and, the, diameter, of, the, black, hole, itself, is, 15, as, by, comparison, the, diameter, of, the, core, of, m87, is, 45, as, arcsecond, and, the, size, of, m87, is, 7, 2, x, 6, 8, am, arcminute, a, 2010, paper, suggested, that, the, black, hole, may, be, displaced, from, the, galactic, center, by, about, seven, parsecs, 23, light, years, this, was, claimed, to, be, in, the, opposite, direction, of, the, known, jet, indicating, acceleration, of, the, black, hole, by, it, another, suggestion, was, that, the, offset, occurred, during, the, merger, of, two, supermassive, black, holes, however, a, 2011, study, did, not, find, any, statistically, significant, displacement, and, a, 2018, study, of, high, resolution, images, of, m87, concluded, that, the, apparent, spatial, offset, was, caused, by, temporal, variations, in, the, jet, s, brightness, rather, than, a, physical, displacement, of, the, black, hole, from, the, galaxy, s, center, this, black, hole, is, the, first, to, be, imaged, data, to, produce, the, image, were, taken, in, april, 2017, the, image, was, produced, during, 2018, and, was, published, on, 10, april, 2019, the, image, shows, the, shadow, of, the, black, hole, surrounded, by, an, asymmetric, emission, ring, with, a, diameter, of, 690, au, 103, billion, km, 64, billion, mi, the, shadow, radius, is, 2, 6, times, that, of, the, black, hole, s, schwarzschild, radius, the, asymmetry, in, the, brightness, of, the, ring, is, due, to, relativistic, beaming, whereby, material, moving, towards, the, observer, at, relativistic, velocities, appears, brighter, the, visible, material, around, the, black, hole, rotates, mostly, clockwise, with, respect, to, the, observer, which, due, to, the, direction, of, the, axis, of, rotation, causes, the, bottom, part, of, the, emission, region, to, have, a, component, of, velocity, toward, the, observer, the, rotation, parameter, was, estimated, at, a, 0, 9, 0, 1, displaystyle, a, 0, 9, pm, 0, 1, corresponding, to, a, rotation, speed, 0, 4, c, after, the, black, hole, had, been, imaged, it, was, named, p, wehi, a, hawaiian, word, meaning, the, adorned, fathomless, dark, creation, taken, from, the, ancient, creation, chant, kumulipo, on, 24, march, 2021, the, event, horizon, telescope, collaboration, revealed, a, unprecedented, unique, view, of, the, m87, black, hole, shadow, how, it, looks, in, polarized, light, polarization, is, a, powerful, tool, which, allows, astronomers, to, probe, physics, behind, the, image, in, more, detail, light, polarization, informs, us, about, the, strength, and, orientation, of, magnetic, fields, in, the, ring, of, light, around, the, black, hole, shadow, knowing, those, is, essential, to, understand, how, m87, s, supermassive, black, hole, is, launching, jets, of, magnetized, plasma, which, expand, at, relativistic, speeds, beyond, the, m87, galaxy, on, 14, april, 2021, astronomers, further, reported, that, the, m87, black, hole, and, its, surroundings, were, studied, during, event, horizon, telescope, 2017, observing, run, also, by, many, multi, wavelength, observatories, from, around, the, world, in, april, 2023, a, team, developed, a, new, principal, component, interferometric, modeling, primo, technique, to, produce, sharper, image, reconstructions, from, eht, data, they, applied, this, to, the, original, eht, observations, of, the, m87, black, hole, yielding, a, crisper, final, image, and, allowing, closer, testing, of, the, alignment, of, observations, to, theory, the, relativistic, jet, of, matter, emerging, from, the, core, extends, at, least, 1, 5, kiloparsecs, 5, 000, light, years, from, the, nucleus, and, consists, of, matter, ejected, from, a, supermassive, black, hole, the, jet, is, highly, collimated, appearing, constrained, to, an, angle, of, 60, within, 0, 8, pc, 2, 6, light, years, of, the, core, to, about, 16, at, two, parsecs, 6, 5, light, years, and, to, 6, 7, at, twelve, parsecs, 39, light, years, its, base, has, the, diameter, of, 5, 5, 0, 4, schwarzschild, radii, and, is, probably, powered, by, a, prograde, accretion, disk, around, the, spinning, supermassive, black, hole, the, german, american, astronomer, walter, baade, found, that, light, from, the, jet, was, plane, polarized, which, suggests, that, the, energy, is, generated, by, the, acceleration, of, electrons, moving, at, relativistic, velocities, in, a, magnetic, field, the, total, energy, of, these, electrons, is, estimated, at, 5, 1, 10, 56, ergs, 5, 1, 10, 49, joules, or, 3, 2, 10, 68, ev, this, is, roughly, 10, 13, times, the, energy, produced, in, the, entire, milky, way, in, one, second, which, is, estimated, at, 5, 10, 36, joules, the, jet, is, surrounded, by, a, lower, velocity, non, relativistic, component, there, is, evidence, of, a, counter, jet, but, it, remains, unseen, from, the, earth, due, to, relativistic, beaming, the, jet, is, precessing, causing, the, outflow, to, form, a, helical, pattern, out, to, 1, 6, parsecs, 5, 2, light, years, lobes, of, expelled, matter, extend, out, to, 80, kiloparsecs, 260, 000, light, years, in, pictures, taken, by, the, hubble, space, telescope, in, 1999, the, motion, of, m87, s, jet, was, measured, at, four, to, six, times, the, speed, of, light, this, phenomenon, called, superluminal, motion, is, an, illusion, caused, by, the, relativistic, velocity, of, the, jet, the, time, interval, between, any, two, light, pulses, emitted, by, the, jet, is, as, registered, by, the, observer, less, than, the, actual, interval, due, to, the, relativistic, speed, of, the, jet, moving, in, the, direction, of, the, observer, this, results, in, perceived, faster, than, light, speeds, though, the, jet, itself, has, a, velocity, of, only, 80, 85, the, speed, of, light, detection, of, such, motion, is, used, to, support, the, theory, that, quasars, bl, lacertae, objects, and, radio, galaxies, may, all, be, the, same, phenomenon, known, as, active, galaxies, viewed, from, different, perspectives, it, is, proposed, that, the, nucleus, of, m87, is, a, bl, lacertae, object, of, lower, luminosity, than, its, surrounds, seen, from, a, relatively, large, angle, flux, variations, characteristic, of, the, bl, lacertae, objects, have, been, observed, in, m87, observations, indicate, that, the, rate, at, which, material, is, ejected, from, the, supermassive, black, hole, is, variable, these, variations, produce, pressure, waves, in, the, hot, gas, surrounding, m87, the, chandra, x, ray, observatory, has, detected, loops, and, rings, in, the, gas, their, distribution, suggests, that, minor, eruptions, occur, every, few, million, years, one, of, the, rings, caused, by, a, major, eruption, is, a, shock, wave, 26, kiloparsecs, 85, 000, light, years, in, diameter, around, the, black, hole, other, features, observed, include, narrow, x, ray, emitting, filaments, up, to, 31, kiloparsecs, 100, 000, light, years, long, and, a, large, cavity, in, the, hot, gas, caused, by, a, major, eruption, 70, million, years, ago, the, regular, eruptions, prevent, a, huge, reservoir, of, gas, from, cooling, and, forming, stars, implying, that, m87, s, evolution, may, have, been, seriously, affected, preventing, it, from, becoming, a, large, spiral, galaxy, m87, is, a, very, strong, source, of, gamma, rays, the, most, energetic, rays, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, gamma, rays, emitted, by, m87, have, been, observed, since, the, late, 1990s, in, 2006, using, the, high, energy, stereoscopic, system, cherenkov, telescopes, scientists, measured, the, variations, of, the, gamma, ray, flux, coming, from, m87, and, found, that, the, flux, changes, over, a, matter, of, days, this, short, period, indicates, that, the, most, likely, source, of, the, gamma, rays, is, a, supermassive, black, hole, in, general, the, smaller, the, diameter, of, the, emission, source, the, faster, the, variation, in, flux, a, knot, of, matter, in, the, jet, designated, hst, 1, about, 65, parsecs, 210, light, years, from, the, core, has, been, tracked, by, the, hubble, space, telescope, and, the, chandra, x, ray, observatory, by, 2006, the, x, ray, intensity, of, this, knot, had, increased, by, a, factor, of, 50, over, a, four, year, period, while, the, x, ray, emission, has, since, been, decaying, in, a, variable, manner, the, interaction, of, relativistic, jets, of, plasma, emanating, from, the, core, with, the, surrounding, medium, gives, rise, to, radio, lobes, in, active, galaxies, the, lobes, occur, in, pairs, and, are, often, symmetrical, the, two, radio, lobes, of, m87, together, span, about, 80, kiloparsecs, the, inner, parts, extending, up, to, 2, kiloparsecs, emit, strongly, at, radio, wavelengths, two, flows, of, material, emerge, from, this, region, one, aligned, with, the, jet, itself, and, the, other, in, the, opposite, direction, the, flows, are, asymmetrical, and, deformed, implying, that, they, encounter, a, dense, intra, cluster, medium, at, greater, distances, both, flows, diffuse, into, two, lobes, the, lobes, are, surrounded, by, a, fainter, halo, of, radio, emitting, gas, the, space, between, the, stars, in, m87, is, filled, with, a, diffuse, interstellar, medium, of, gas, that, has, been, chemically, enriched, by, the, elements, ejected, from, stars, as, they, passed, beyond, their, main, sequence, lifetime, carbon, and, nitrogen, are, continuously, supplied, by, stars, of, intermediate, mass, as, they, pass, through, the, asymptotic, giant, branch, the, heavier, elements, from, oxygen, to, iron, are, produced, largely, by, supernova, explosions, within, the, galaxy, of, the, heavy, elements, about, 60, were, produced, by, core, collapse, supernovae, while, the, remainder, came, from, type, ia, supernovae, the, distribution, of, oxygen, is, roughly, uniform, throughout, at, about, half, of, the, solar, value, i, e, oxygen, abundance, in, the, sun, while, iron, distribution, peaks, near, the, center, where, it, approaches, the, solar, iron, value, since, oxygen, is, produced, mainly, by, core, collapse, supernovae, which, occur, during, the, early, stages, of, galaxies, and, mostly, in, outer, star, forming, regions, the, distribution, of, these, elements, suggests, an, early, enrichment, of, the, interstellar, medium, from, core, collapse, supernovae, and, a, continuous, contribution, from, type, ia, supernovae, throughout, the, history, of, m87, the, contribution, of, elements, from, these, sources, was, much, lower, than, in, the, milky, way, examination, of, m87, at, far, infrared, wavelengths, shows, an, excess, emission, at, wavelengths, longer, than, 25, m, normally, this, may, be, an, indication, of, thermal, emission, by, warm, dust, in, the, case, of, m87, the, emission, can, be, fully, explained, by, synchrotron, radiation, from, the, jet, within, the, galaxy, silicate, grains, are, expected, to, survive, for, no, more, than, 46, million, years, because, of, the, x, ray, emission, from, the, core, this, dust, may, be, destroyed, by, the, hostile, environment, or, expelled, from, the, galaxy, the, combined, mass, of, dust, in, m87, is, no, more, than, 70, 000, times, the, mass, of, the, sun, by, comparison, the, milky, way, s, dust, equals, about, a, hundred, million, 10, 8, solar, masses, although, m87, is, an, elliptical, galaxy, and, therefore, lacks, the, dust, lanes, of, a, spiral, galaxy, optical, filaments, have, been, observed, in, it, which, arise, from, gas, falling, towards, the, core, emission, probably, comes, from, shock, induced, excitation, as, the, falling, gas, streams, encounter, x, rays, from, the, core, region, these, filaments, have, an, estimated, mass, of, about, 10, 000, m, surrounding, the, galaxy, is, an, extended, corona, with, hot, low, density, gas, m87, has, an, abnormally, large, population, of, globular, clusters, a, 2006, survey, out, to, an, angular, distance, of, 25, from, the, core, estimates, that, there, are, 12, 000, 800, globular, clusters, in, orbit, around, m87, compared, with, 150, 200, in, and, around, the, milky, way, the, clusters, are, similar, in, size, distribution, to, those, of, the, milky, way, most, having, an, effective, radius, of, 1, to, 6, parsecs, the, size, of, the, m87, clusters, gradually, increases, with, distance, from, the, galactic, center, within, a, four, kiloparsec, 13, 000, light, year, radius, of, the, core, the, cluster, metallicity, the, abundance, of, elements, other, than, hydrogen, and, helium, is, about, half, the, abundance, in, the, sun, outside, this, radius, metallicity, steadily, declines, as, the, cluster, distance, from, the, core, increases, clusters, with, low, metallicity, are, somewhat, larger, than, metal, rich, clusters, in, 2014, hvgc, 1, the, first, hypervelocity, globular, cluster, was, discovered, escaping, from, m87, at, 2, 300, km, s, the, escape, of, the, cluster, with, such, a, high, velocity, was, speculated, to, have, been, the, result, of, a, close, encounter, with, and, subsequent, gravitational, kick, from, a, supermassive, black, hole, binary, almost, a, hundred, ultra, compact, dwarfs, have, been, identified, in, m87, they, resemble, globular, clusters, but, have, a, diameter, of, ten, parsecs, 33, light, years, or, more, much, larger, than, the, three, parsec, 9, 8, light, year, maximum, of, globular, clusters, it, is, unclear, whether, they, are, dwarf, galaxies, captured, by, m87, or, a, new, class, of, massive, globular, cluster, m87, is, near, or, at, the, center, of, the, virgo, cluster, a, closely, compacted, structure, of, about, 2, 000, galaxies, this, forms, the, core, of, the, larger, virgo, supercluster, of, which, the, local, group, including, the, milky, way, is, an, outlying, member, it, is, organized, into, at, least, three, distinct, subsystems, associated, with, the, three, large, galaxies, m87, m49, and, m86, with, the, core, subgroup, including, m87, virgo, a, and, m49, virgo, b, there, is, a, preponderance, of, elliptical, and, s0, galaxies, around, m87, a, chain, of, elliptical, galaxies, roughly, aligns, with, the, jet, in, terms, of, mass, m87, is, likely, to, be, the, largest, and, coupled, with, centrality, appears, to, be, moving, very, little, relative, to, the, cluster, as, a, whole, it, is, defined, in, one, study, as, the, cluster, center, the, cluster, has, a, sparse, gaseous, medium, that, emits, x, rays, lower, in, temperature, toward, the, middle, the, combined, mass, of, the, cluster, is, estimated, to, be, 0, 15, to, 1, 5, 10, 15, m, measurements, of, the, motion, of, those, intracluster, starburst, planetary, nebulae, between, m87, and, m86, suggest, that, the, two, galaxies, are, moving, toward, each, other, and, that, this, may, be, their, first, encounter, m87, may, have, interacted, with, m84, as, evidenced, by, the, truncation, of, m87, s, outer, halo, by, tidal, interactions, the, truncated, halo, may, also, have, been, caused, by, contraction, due, to, an, unseen, mass, falling, into, m87, from, the, rest, of, the, cluster, which, may, be, the, hypothesized, dark, matter, a, third, possibility, is, that, the, halo, s, formation, was, truncated, by, early, feedback, from, the, active, galactic, nucleus
