canis, major, is, a, constellation, in, the, southern, celestial, hemisphere, in, the, second, century, it, was, included, in, ptolemy, s, 48, constellations, and, is, counted, among, the, 88, modern, constellations, its, name, is, latin, for, greater, dog, in, contrast, to, canis, minor, the, lesser, dog, both, figures, are, commonly, represented, as, following, the, constellation, of, orion, the, hunter, through, the, sky, the, milky, way, passes, through, canis, major, and, several, open, clusters, lie, within, its, borders, most, notably, m41, canis, major, contains, sirius, the, brightest, star, in, the, night, sky, known, as, the, dog, star, it, is, bright, because, of, its, proximity, to, the, solar, system, and, its, intrinsic, brightness, in, contrast, the, other, bright, stars, of, the, constellation, are, stars, of, great, distance, and, high, luminosity, at, magnitude, 1, 5, epsilon, canis, majoris, adhara, is, the, second, brightest, star, of, the, constellation, and, the, brightest, source, of, extreme, ultraviolet, radiation, in, the, night, sky, next, in, brightness, are, the, yellow, white, supergiant, delta, wezen, at, 1, 8, the, blue, white, giant, beta, mirzam, at, 2, 0, blue, white, supergiants, eta, aludra, at, 2, 4, and, omicron, 2, at, 3, 0, and, white, spectroscopic, binary, zeta, furud, also, at, 3, 0, the, red, hypergiant, vy, cma, is, one, of, the, largest, stars, known, while, the, neutron, star, rx, j0720, 4, 3125, has, a, radius, of, a, mere, 5, km, in, ancient, mesopotamia, sirius, named, kak, si, sa, 2, by, the, babylonians, was, seen, as, an, arrow, aiming, towards, orion, while, the, southern, stars, of, canis, major, and, a, part, of, puppis, were, viewed, as, a, bow, named, ban, in, the, three, stars, each, tablets, dating, to, around, 1100, bc, in, the, later, compendium, of, babylonian, astronomy, and, astrology, titled, mul, apin, the, arrow, sirius, was, also, linked, with, the, warrior, ninurta, and, the, bow, with, ishtar, daughter, of, enlil, ninurta, was, linked, to, the, later, deity, marduk, who, was, said, to, have, slain, the, ocean, goddess, tiamat, with, a, great, bow, and, worshipped, as, the, principal, deity, in, babylon, the, ancient, greeks, replaced, the, bow, and, arrow, depiction, with, that, of, a, dog, in, greek, mythology, canis, major, represented, the, dog, laelaps, a, gift, from, zeus, to, europa, or, sometimes, the, hound, of, procris, diana, s, nymph, or, the, one, given, by, aurora, to, cephalus, so, famed, for, its, speed, that, zeus, elevated, it, to, the, sky, it, was, also, considered, to, represent, one, of, orion, s, hunting, dogs, pursuing, lepus, the, hare, or, helping, orion, fight, taurus, the, bull, and, is, referred, to, in, this, way, by, aratos, homer, and, hesiod, the, ancient, greeks, refer, only, to, one, dog, but, by, roman, times, canis, minor, appears, as, orion, s, second, dog, alternative, names, include, canis, sequens, and, canis, alter, canis, syrius, was, the, name, used, in, the, 1521, alfonsine, tables, the, roman, myth, refers, to, canis, major, as, custos, europae, the, dog, guarding, europa, but, failing, to, prevent, her, abduction, by, jupiter, in, the, form, of, a, bull, and, as, janitor, lethaeus, the, watchdog, in, medieval, arab, astronomy, the, constellation, became, al, kalb, al, akbar, the, greater, dog, transcribed, as, alcheleb, alachbar, by, 17th, century, writer, edmund, chilmead, islamic, scholar, ab, ray, n, al, b, r, n, referred, to, orion, as, kalb, al, jabb, r, the, dog, of, the, giant, among, the, merazig, of, tunisia, shepherds, note, six, constellations, that, mark, the, passage, of, the, dry, hot, season, one, of, them, called, merzem, includes, the, stars, of, canis, major, and, canis, minor, and, is, the, herald, of, two, weeks, of, hot, weather, in, chinese, astronomy, the, modern, constellation, of, canis, major, is, located, in, the, vermilion, bird, n, n, f, ng, zh, qu, where, the, stars, were, classified, in, several, separate, asterisms, of, stars, the, military, market, j, nsh, was, a, circular, pattern, of, stars, containing, nu, 3, beta, xi, 1, and, xi, 2, and, some, stars, from, lepus, the, wild, cockerel, y, j, was, at, the, centre, of, the, military, market, although, it, is, uncertain, which, stars, depicted, what, schlegel, reported, that, the, stars, omicron, and, pi, canis, majoris, might, have, been, them, while, beta, or, nu, 2, have, also, been, proposed, sirius, was, ti, nl, ng, the, celestial, wolf, denoting, invasion, and, plunder, southeast, of, the, wolf, was, the, asterism, h, sh, the, celestial, bow, and, arrow, which, was, interpreted, as, containing, delta, epsilon, eta, and, kappa, canis, majoris, and, delta, velorum, alternatively, the, arrow, was, depicted, by, omicron, 2, and, eta, and, aiming, at, sirius, the, wolf, while, the, bow, comprised, kappa, epsilon, sigma, delta, and, 164, canis, majoris, and, pi, and, omicron, puppis, both, the, m, ori, people, and, the, people, of, the, tuamotus, recognized, the, figure, of, canis, major, as, a, distinct, entity, though, it, was, sometimes, absorbed, into, other, constellations, te, huinga, o, rehua, also, called, te, putahi, nui, o, rehua, and, te, kahui, takurua, the, assembly, of, rehua, or, the, assembly, of, sirius, was, a, m, ori, constellation, that, included, both, canis, minor, and, canis, major, along, with, some, surrounding, stars, related, was, taumata, o, rehua, also, called, pukawanui, the, mirror, of, rehua, formed, from, an, undefined, group, of, stars, in, canis, major, they, called, sirius, rehua, and, takarua, corresponding, to, two, of, the, names, for, the, constellation, though, rehua, was, a, name, applied, to, other, stars, in, various, m, ori, groups, and, other, polynesian, cosmologies, the, tuamotu, people, called, canis, major, muihanga, hetika, o, takurua, the, abiding, assemblage, of, takarua, the, tharumba, people, of, the, shoalhaven, river, saw, three, stars, of, canis, major, as, wunbula, bat, and, his, two, wives, murrumbool, mrs, brown, snake, and, moodtha, mrs, black, snake, bored, of, following, their, husband, around, the, women, try, to, bury, him, while, he, is, hunting, a, wombat, down, its, hole, he, spears, them, and, all, three, are, placed, in, the, sky, as, the, constellation, munowra, to, the, boorong, people, of, victoria, sigma, canis, majoris, was, unurgunite, which, has, become, the, official, name, of, this, star, and, its, flanking, stars, delta, and, epsilon, were, his, two, wives, the, moon, mityan, native, cat, sought, to, lure, the, further, wife, epsilon, away, but, unurgunite, assaulted, him, and, he, has, been, wandering, the, sky, ever, since, canis, major, is, a, constellation, in, the, southern, hemisphere, s, summer, or, northern, hemisphere, s, winter, sky, bordered, by, monoceros, which, lies, between, it, and, canis, minor, to, the, north, puppis, to, the, east, and, southeast, columba, to, the, southwest, and, lepus, to, the, west, the, three, letter, abbreviation, for, the, constellation, as, adopted, by, the, international, astronomical, union, in, 1922, is, cma, the, official, constellation, boundaries, as, set, by, belgian, astronomer, eug, ne, delporte, in, 1930, are, defined, by, a, quadrilateral, in, the, equatorial, coordinate, system, the, right, ascension, coordinates, of, these, borders, lie, between, 06, h, 12, 5, m, and, 07, h, 27, 5, m, while, the, declination, coordinates, are, between, 11, 03, and, 33, 25, covering, 380, square, degrees, or, 0, 921, of, the, sky, it, ranks, 43rd, of, the, 88, currently, recognized, constellations, in, size, canis, major, is, a, prominent, constellation, because, of, its, many, bright, stars, these, include, sirius, alpha, canis, majoris, the, brightest, star, in, the, night, sky, as, well, as, three, other, stars, above, magnitude, 2, 0, furthermore, two, other, stars, are, thought, to, have, previously, outshone, all, others, in, the, night, sky, adhara, epsilon, canis, majoris, shone, at, 3, 99, around, 4, 7, million, years, ago, and, mirzam, beta, canis, majoris, peaked, at, 3, 65, around, 4, 42, million, years, ago, another, nr, canis, majoris, will, be, brightest, at, magnitude, 0, 88, in, about, 2, 87, million, years, time, the, german, cartographer, johann, bayer, used, the, greek, letters, alpha, through, omicron, to, label, the, most, prominent, stars, in, the, constellation, including, three, adjacent, stars, as, nu, and, two, further, pairs, as, xi, and, omicron, while, subsequent, observers, designated, further, stars, in, the, southern, parts, of, the, constellation, that, were, hard, to, discern, from, central, europe, bayer, s, countryman, johann, elert, bode, later, added, sigma, tau, and, omega, the, french, astronomer, nicolas, louis, de, lacaille, added, lettered, stars, a, to, k, though, none, are, in, use, today, john, flamsteed, numbered, 31, stars, with, 3, canis, majoris, being, placed, by, lacaille, into, columba, as, delta, columbae, flamsteed, had, not, recognised, columba, as, a, distinct, constellation, he, also, labelled, two, stars, his, 10, and, 13, canis, majoris, as, kappa, 1, and, kappa, 2, respectively, but, subsequent, cartographers, such, as, francis, baily, and, john, bevis, dropped, the, fainter, former, star, leaving, kappa, 2, as, the, sole, kappa, flamsteed, s, listing, of, nu, 1, nu, 2, nu, 3, xi, 1, xi, 2, omicron, 1, and, omicron, 2, have, all, remained, in, use, sirius, is, the, brightest, star, in, the, night, sky, at, apparent, magnitude, 1, 46, and, one, of, the, closest, stars, to, earth, at, a, distance, of, 8, 6, light, years, its,

indicating, a, compact, shell, of, dust, but, it, appears, to, be, a, main, sequence, star, that, has, absorbed, material, from, a, companion, these, stars, are, thought, to, be, significant, contributors, to, interstellar, dust, the, band, of, the, milky, way, goes, through, canis, major, with, only, patchy, obscurement, by, interstellar, dust, clouds, it, is, bright, in, the, northeastern, corner, of, the, constellation, as, well, as, in, a, triangular, area, between, adhara, wezen, and, aludra, with, many, stars, visible, in, binoculars, canis, major, boasts, several, open, clusters, the, only, messier, object, is, m41, ngc, 2287, an, open, cluster, with, a, combined, visual, magnitude, of, 4, 5, around, 2300, light, years, from, earth, located, 4, degrees, south, of, sirius, it, contains, contrasting, blue, yellow, and, orange, stars, and, covers, an, area, the, apparent, size, of, the, full, moon, in, reality, around, 25, light, years, in, diameter, its, most, luminous, stars, have, already, evolved, into, giants, the, brightest, is, a, 6, 3, magnitude, star, of, spectral, type, k3, located, in, the, field, is, 12, canis, majoris, though, this, star, is, only, 670, light, years, distant, ngc, 2360, known, as, caroline, s, cluster, after, its, discoverer, caroline, herschel, is, an, open, cluster, located, 3, 5, degrees, west, of, muliphein, and, has, a, combined, apparent, magnitude, of, 7, 2, around, 15, light, years, in, diameter, it, is, located, 3700, light, years, away, from, earth, and, has, been, dated, to, around, 2, 2, billion, years, old, ngc, 2362, is, a, small, compact, open, cluster, 5200, light, years, from, earth, it, contains, about, 60, stars, of, which, tau, canis, majoris, is, the, brightest, member, located, around, 3, degrees, northeast, of, wezen, it, covers, an, area, around, 12, light, years, in, diameter, though, the, stars, appear, huddled, around, tau, when, seen, through, binoculars, it, is, a, very, young, open, cluster, as, its, member, stars, are, only, a, few, million, years, old, lying, 2, degrees, southwest, of, ngc, 2362, is, ngc, 2354, a, fainter, open, cluster, of, magnitude, 6, 5, with, around, 15, member, stars, visible, with, binoculars, located, around, 30, northeast, of, ngc, 2360, ngc, 2359, thor, s, helmet, or, the, duck, nebula, is, a, relatively, bright, emission, nebula, in, canis, major, with, an, approximate, magnitude, of, 10, which, is, 10, 000, light, years, from, earth, the, nebula, is, shaped, by, hd, 56925, an, unstable, wolf, rayet, star, embedded, within, it, in, 2003, an, overdensity, of, stars, in, the, region, was, announced, to, be, the, canis, major, dwarf, the, closest, satellite, galaxy, to, earth, however, there, remains, debate, over, whether, it, represents, a, disrupted, dwarf, galaxy, or, in, fact, a, variation, in, the, thin, and, thick, disk, and, spiral, arm, populations, of, the, milky, way, investigation, of, the, area, yielded, only, ten, rr, lyrae, variables, consistent, with, the, milky, way, s, halo, and, thick, disk, populations, rather, than, a, separate, dwarf, spheroidal, galaxy, on, the, other, hand, a, globular, cluster, in, puppis, ngc, 2298, which, appears, to, be, part, of, the, canis, major, dwarf, system, is, extremely, metal, poor, suggesting, it, did, not, arise, from, the, milky, way, s, thick, disk, and, instead, is, of, extragalactic, origin, ngc, 2207, and, ic, 2163, are, a, pair, of, face, on, interacting, spiral, galaxies, located, 125, million, light, years, from, earth, about, 40, million, years, ago, the, two, galaxies, had, a, close, encounter, and, are, now, moving, farther, apart, nevertheless, the, smaller, ic, 2163, will, eventually, be, incorporated, into, ngc, 2207, as, the, interaction, continues, gas, and, dust, will, be, perturbed, sparking, extensive, star, formation, in, both, galaxies, supernovae, have, been, observed, in, ngc, 2207, in, 1975, type, ia, sn, 1975a, 1999, the, type, ib, sn, 1999ec, 2003, type, 1b, supernova, sn, 2003h, and, 2013, type, ii, supernova, sn, 2013ai, located, 16, million, light, years, distant, eso, 489, 056, is, an, irregular, dwarf, and, low, surface, brightness, galaxy, that, has, one, of, the, lowest, metallicities, known
