neon, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, ne, and, atomic, number, 10, it, is, the, second, noble, gas, in, the, periodic, table, neon, is, a, colorless, odorless, inert, monatomic, gas, under, standard, conditions, with, approximately, two, thirds, the, density, of, air, neon, was, discovered, in, 1898, alongside, krypton, and, xenon, identified, as, one, of, the, three, remaining, rare, inert, elements, in, dry, air, after, the, removal, of, nitrogen, oxygen, argon, and, carbon, dioxide, its, discovery, was, marked, by, the, distinctive, bright, red, emission, spectrum, it, exhibited, leading, to, its, immediate, recognition, as, a, new, element, the, name, neon, originates, from, the, greek, word, a, neuter, singular, form, of, neos, meaning, new, neon, is, a, chemically, inert, gas, with, no, known, uncharged, neon, compounds, existing, neon, compounds, are, primarily, ionic, molecules, or, fragile, molecules, held, together, by, van, der, waals, forces, the, synthesis, of, most, neon, in, the, cosmos, resulted, from, the, nuclear, fusion, within, stars, of, oxygen, and, helium, through, the, alpha, capture, process, despite, its, abundant, presence, in, the, universe, and, solar, system, ranking, fifth, in, cosmic, abundance, following, hydrogen, helium, oxygen, and, carbon, neon, is, comparatively, scarce, on, earth, it, constitutes, about, 18, 2, ppm, of, earth, s, atmospheric, volume, and, a, lesser, fraction, in, the, earth, s, crust, the, high, volatility, of, neon, and, its, inability, to, form, compounds, that, would, anchor, it, to, solids, explain, its, limited, presence, on, earth, and, the, inner, terrestrial, planets, neon, s, high, volatility, facilitated, its, escape, from, planetesimals, under, the, early, solar, system, s, nascent, sun, s, warmth, neon, s, notable, applications, include, its, use, in, low, voltage, neon, glow, lamps, high, voltage, discharge, tubes, and, neon, advertising, signs, where, it, emits, a, distinct, reddish, orange, glow, this, same, red, emission, line, is, responsible, for, the, characteristic, red, light, of, helium, neon, lasers, although, neon, has, some, applications, in, plasma, tubes, and, as, a, refrigerant, its, commercial, uses, are, relatively, limited, it, is, primarily, obtained, through, the, fractional, distillation, of, liquid, air, making, it, significantly, more, expensive, than, helium, due, to, air, being, its, sole, source, neon, was, discovered, in, 1898, by, the, british, chemists, sir, william, ramsay, 1852, 1916, and, morris, travers, 1872, 1961, in, london, neon, was, discovered, when, ramsay, chilled, a, sample, of, air, until, it, became, a, liquid, then, warmed, the, liquid, and, captured, the, gases, as, they, boiled, off, the, gases, nitrogen, oxygen, and, argon, had, been, identified, but, the, remaining, gases, were, isolated, in, roughly, their, order, of, abundance, in, a, six, week, period, beginning, at, the, end, of, may, 1898, the, first, remaining, gas, to, be, identified, was, krypton, the, next, after, krypton, had, been, removed, was, a, gas, which, gave, a, brilliant, red, light, under, spectroscopic, discharge, this, gas, identified, in, june, was, named, neon, the, greek, analogue, of, the, latin, novum, new, suggested, by, ramsay, s, son, the, characteristic, brilliant, red, orange, color, emitted, by, gaseous, neon, when, excited, electrically, was, noted, immediately, travers, later, wrote, the, blaze, of, crimson, light, from, the, tube, told, its, own, story, and, was, a, sight, to, dwell, upon, and, never, forget, a, second, gas, was, also, reported, along, with, neon, having, approximately, the, same, density, as, argon, but, with, a, different, spectrum, ramsay, and, travers, named, it, metargon, however, the, subsequent, spectroscopic, analysis, revealed, it, to, be, argon, contaminated, with, carbon, monoxide, finally, the, same, team, discovered, xenon, by, the, same, process, in, september, 1898, neon, s, scarcity, precluded, its, prompt, application, for, lighting, along, the, lines, of, moore, tubes, which, used, nitrogen, and, which, were, commercialized, in, the, early, 1900s, after, 1902, georges, claude, s, company, air, liquide, produced, industrial, quantities, of, neon, as, a, byproduct, of, his, air, liquefaction, business, in, december, 1910, claude, demonstrated, modern, neon, lighting, based, on, a, sealed, tube, of, neon, claude, tried, briefly, to, sell, neon, tubes, for, indoor, domestic, lighting, due, to, their, intensity, but, the, market, failed, because, homeowners, objected, to, the, color, in, 1912, claude, s, associate, began, selling, neon, discharge, tubes, as, eye, catching, advertising, signs, and, was, instantly, more, successful, neon, tubes, were, introduced, to, the, u, s, in, 1923, with, two, large, neon, signs, bought, by, a, los, angeles, packard, car, dealership, the, glow, and, arresting, red, color, made, neon, advertising, completely, different, from, the, competition, the, intense, color, and, vibrancy, of, neon, equated, with, american, society, at, the, time, suggesting, a, century, of, progress, and, transforming, cities, into, sensational, new, environments, filled, with, radiating, advertisements, and, electro, graphic, architecture, neon, played, a, role, in, the, basic, understanding, of, the, nature, of, atoms, in, 1913, when, j, j, thomson, as, part, of, his, exploration, into, the, composition, of, canal, rays, channeled, streams, of, neon, ions, through, a, magnetic, and, an, electric, field, and, measured, the, deflection, of, the, streams, with, a, photographic, plate, thomson, observed, two, separate, patches, of, light, on, the, photographic, plate, see, image, which, suggested, two, different, parabolas, of, deflection, thomson, eventually, concluded, that, some, of, the, atoms, in, the, neon, gas, were, of, higher, mass, than, the, rest, though, not, understood, at, the, time, by, thomson, this, was, the, first, discovery, of, isotopes, of, stable, atoms, thomson, s, device, was, a, crude, version, of, the, instrument, we, now, term, a, mass, spectrometer, neon, has, three, stable, isotopes, 20, ne, 90, 48, 21, ne, 0, 27, and, 22, ne, 9, 25, 21, ne, and, 22, ne, are, partly, primordial, and, partly, nucleogenic, i, e, made, by, nuclear, reactions, of, other, nuclides, with, neutrons, or, other, particles, in, the, environment, and, their, variations, in, natural, abundance, are, well, understood, in, contrast, 20, ne, the, chief, primordial, isotope, made, in, stellar, nucleosynthesis, is, not, known, to, be, nucleogenic, or, radiogenic, except, from, the, decay, of, oxygen, 20, which, is, produced, in, very, rare, cases, of, cluster, decay, by, thorium, 228, the, causes, of, the, variation, of, 20, ne, in, the, earth, have, thus, been, hotly, debated, the, principal, nuclear, reactions, generating, nucleogenic, neon, isotopes, start, from, 24, mg, and, 25, mg, which, produce, 21, ne, and, 22, ne, respectively, after, neutron, capture, and, immediate, emission, of, an, alpha, particle, the, neutrons, that, produce, the, reactions, are, mostly, produced, by, secondary, spallation, reactions, from, alpha, particles, in, turn, derived, from, uranium, series, decay, chains, the, net, result, yields, a, trend, towards, lower, 20, ne, 22, ne, and, higher, 21, ne, 22, ne, ratios, observed, in, uranium, rich, rocks, such, as, granites, in, addition, isotopic, analysis, of, exposed, terrestrial, rocks, has, demonstrated, the, cosmogenic, cosmic, ray, production, of, 21, ne, this, isotope, is, generated, by, spallation, reactions, on, magnesium, sodium, silicon, and, aluminium, by, analyzing, all, three, isotopes, the, cosmogenic, component, can, be, resolved, from, magmatic, neon, and, nucleogenic, neon, this, suggests, that, neon, will, be, a, useful, tool, in, determining, cosmic, exposure, ages, of, surface, rocks, and, meteorites, neon, in, solar, wind, contains, a, higher, proportion, of, 20, ne, than, nucleogenic, and, cosmogenic, sources, neon, content, observed, in, samples, of, volcanic, gases, and, diamonds, is, also, enriched, in, 20, ne, suggesting, a, primordial, possibly, solar, origin, neon, is, the, second, lightest, noble, gas, after, helium, like, other, noble, gases, neon, is, colorless, and, odorless, it, glows, reddish, orange, in, a, vacuum, discharge, tube, it, has, over, 40, times, the, refrigerating, capacity, per, unit, volume, of, liquid, helium, and, three, times, that, of, liquid, hydrogen, in, most, applications, it, is, a, less, expensive, refrigerant, than, helium, despite, helium, surpassing, neon, in, terms, of, ionization, energy, it, is, theorized, to, be, the, least, reactive, of, all, the, elements, even, less, so, than, the, former, neon, plasma, has, the, most, intense, light, discharge, at, normal, voltages, and, currents, of, all, the, noble, gases, the, average, color, of, this, light, to, the, human, eye, is, red, orange, due, to, many, lines, in, this, range, it, also, contains, a, strong, green, line, which, is, hidden, unless, the, visual, components, are, dispersed, by, a, spectroscope, stable, isotopes, of, neon, are, produced, in, stars, neon, s, most, abundant, isotope, 20, ne, 90, 48, is, created, by, the, nuclear, fusion, of, carbon, and, carbon, in, the, carbon, burning, process, of, stellar, nucleosynthesis, this, requires, temperatures, above, 500, megakelvins, which, occur, in, the, cores, of, stars, of, more, than, 8, solar, masses, neon, is, abundant, on, a, universal, scale, it, is, the, fifth, most, abundant, chemical, element, in, the, universe, by, mass, after, hydrogen, helium, oxygen, and, carbon, see, chemical, element, its, relative, rarity, on, earth, like, that, of, helium, is, due, to, its, relative, lightness, high, vapor, pressure, at, very, low, temperatures, and, chemical, inertness, all, properties, which, tend, to, keep, it, from, being, trapped, in, the, condensing, gas, and, dust, clouds, that, formed, the, smaller, and, warmer, solid, planets, like, earth, neon, is, monatomic, making, it, lighter, than, the, molecules, of, diatomic, nitrogen, and, oxygen, which, form, the, bulk, of, earth, s, atmosphere, a, balloon, filled, with, neon, will, rise, in, air, albeit, more, slowly, than, a, helium, balloon, neon, s, abundance, in, the, universe, is, about, 1, part, in, 750, by, mass, in, the, sun, and, presumably, in, its, proto, solar, system, nebula, about, 1, part, in, 600, the, galileo, spacecraft, atmospheric, entry, probe, found, that, in, the, upper, atmosphere, of, jupiter, the, abundance, of, neon, is, reduced, depleted, by, about, a, factor, of, 10, to, a, level, of, 1, part, in, 6, 000, by, mass, this, may, indicate, that, the, ice, planetesimals, that, brought, neon, into, jupiter, from, the, outer, solar, system, formed, in, a, region, that, was, too, warm, to, retain, the, neon, atmospheric, component, abundances, of, heavier, inert, gases, on, jupiter, are, several, times, that, found, in, the, sun, or, that, neon, is, selectively, sequestered, in, the, planet, s, interior, neon, comprises, 1, part, in, 55, 000, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, or, 18, 2, ppm, by, volume, this, is, about, the, same, as, the, molecule, or, mole, fraction, or, 1, part, in, 79, 000, of, air, by, mass, it, comprises, a, smaller, fraction, in, the, crust, it, is, industrially, produced, by, cryogenic, fractional, distillation, of, liquefied, air, on, 17, august, 2015, based, on, studies, with, the, lunar, atmosphere, and, dust, environment, explorer, ladee, spacecraft, nasa, scientists, reported, the, detection, of, neon, in, the, exosphere, of, the, moon, neon, is, the, first, p, block, noble, gas, and, the, first, element, with, a, true, octet, of, electrons, it, is, inert, as, is, the, case, with, its, lighter, analog, helium, no, strongly, bound, neutral, molecules, containing, neon, have, been, identified, the, ions, and, have, been, observed, from, optical, and, mass, spectrometric, studies, solid, neon, clathrate, hydrate, was, produced, from, water, ice, and, neon, gas, at, pressures, 350, 480, mpa, and, temperatures, about, 30, c, ne, atoms, are, not, bonded, to, water, and, can, freely, move, through, this, material, they, can, be, extracted, by, placing, the, clathrate, into, a, vacuum, chamber, for, several, days, yielding, ice, xvi, the, least, dense, crystalline, form, of, water, the, familiar, pauling, electronegativity, scale, relies, upon, chemical, bond, energies, but, such, values, have, obviously, not, been, measured, for, inert, helium, and, neon, the, allen, electronegativity, scale, which, relies, only, upon, measurable, atomic, energies, identifies, neon, as, the, most, electronegative, element, closely, followed, by, fluorine, and, helium, the, triple, point, temperature, of, neon, 24, 5561, k, is, a, defining, fixed, point, in, the, international, temperature, scale, of, 1990, neon, is, produced, from, air, in, cryogenic, air, separation, plants, a, gas, phase, mixture, mainly, of, nitrogen, neon, helium, and, hydrogen, is, withdrawn, from, the, main, condenser, at, the, top, of, the, high, pressure, air, separation, column, and, fed, to, the, bottom, of, a, side, column, for, rectification, of, the, neon, it, can, then, be, further, purified, from, helium, by, bringing, it, into, contact, with, activated, charcoal, hydrogen, is, purified, from, the, neon, by, adding, oxygen, so, water, is, formed, and, is, condensed, 1, pound, of, pure, neon, can, be, produced, from, the, processing, of, 88, 000, pounds, of, the, gas, phase, mixture, about, 70, of, the, global, neon, supply, is, produced, in, ukraine, as, a, by, product, of, steel, production, in, russia, as, of, 2020, the, company, iceblick, with, plants, in, odesa, and, moscow, supplies, 65, of, the, world, s, production, of, neon, as, well, as, 15, of, the, krypton, and, xenon, global, neon, prices, jumped, by, about, 600, after, the, 2014, russian, annexation, of, crimea, spurring, some, chip, manufacturers, to, start, shifting, away, from, russian, and, ukrainian, suppliers, and, toward, suppliers, in, china, the, 2022, russian, invasion, of, ukraine, also, shut, down, two, companies, in, ukraine, that, produced, about, half, of, the, global, supply, cryoin, engineering, ukrainian, and, inhaz, ukrainian, located, in, odesa, and, mariupol, respectively, the, closure, was, predicted, to, exacerbate, the, covid, 19, chip, shortage, which, may, further, shift, neon, production, to, china, two, quite, different, kinds, of, neon, lighting, are, in, common, use, neon, glow, lamps, are, generally, tiny, with, most, operating, between, 100, and, 250, volts, they, have, been, widely, used, as, power, on, indicators, and, in, circuit, testing, equipment, but, light, emitting, diodes, leds, now, dominate, in, those, applications, these, simple, neon, devices, were, the, forerunners, of, plasma, displays, and, plasma, television, screens, neon, signs, typically, operate, at, much, higher, voltages, 2, 15, kilovolts, and, the, luminous, tubes, are, commonly, meters, long, the, glass, tubing, is, often, formed, into, shapes, and, letters, for, signage, as, well, as, architectural, and, artistic, applications, in, neon, signs, neon, produces, an, unmistakable, bright, reddish, orange, light, when, electric, current, passes, through, it, under, low, pressure, although, tube, lights, with, other, colors, are, often, called, neon, they, use, different, noble, gases, or, varied, colors, of, fluorescent, lighting, for, example, argon, produces, a, lavender, or, blue, hue, as, of, 2012, there, are, over, one, hundred, colors, available, neon, is, used, in, vacuum, tubes, high, voltage, indicators, lightning, arresters, wavemeter, tubes, television, tubes, and, helium, neon, lasers, gas, mixtures, that, include, high, purity, neon, are, used, in, lasers, for, photolithography, in, semiconductor, device,
