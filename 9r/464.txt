sulfuric, acid, american, spelling, and, the, preferred, iupac, name, or, sulphuric, acid, commonwealth, spelling, known, in, antiquity, as, oil, of, vitriol, is, a, mineral, acid, composed, of, the, elements, sulfur, oxygen, and, hydrogen, with, the, molecular, formula, h, 2, so, 4, it, is, a, colorless, odorless, and, viscous, liquid, that, is, miscible, with, water, pure, sulfuric, acid, does, not, occur, naturally, due, to, its, strong, affinity, to, water, vapor, it, is, hygroscopic, and, readily, absorbs, water, vapor, from, the, air, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, is, highly, corrosive, towards, other, materials, from, rocks, to, metals, since, it, is, an, oxidant, with, powerful, dehydrating, properties, phosphorus, pentoxide, is, a, notable, exception, in, that, it, is, not, dehydrated, by, sulfuric, acid, but, to, the, contrary, dehydrates, sulfuric, acid, to, sulfur, trioxide, upon, addition, of, sulfuric, acid, to, water, a, considerable, amount, of, heat, is, released, thus, the, reverse, procedure, of, adding, water, to, the, acid, is, generally, avoided, since, the, heat, released, may, boil, the, solution, spraying, droplets, of, hot, acid, during, the, process, upon, contact, with, body, tissue, sulfuric, acid, can, cause, severe, acidic, chemical, burns, and, secondary, thermal, burns, due, to, dehydration, dilute, sulfuric, acid, is, substantially, less, hazardous, without, the, oxidative, and, dehydrating, properties, though, it, is, handled, with, care, for, its, acidity, sulfuric, acid, is, a, very, important, commodity, chemical, a, country, s, sulfuric, acid, production, is, a, good, indicator, of, its, industrial, strength, many, methods, for, its, production, are, known, including, the, contact, process, the, wet, sulfuric, acid, process, and, the, lead, chamber, process, sulfuric, acid, is, also, a, key, substance, in, the, chemical, industry, it, is, most, commonly, used, in, fertilizer, manufacture, but, is, also, important, in, mineral, processing, oil, refining, wastewater, processing, and, chemical, synthesis, it, has, a, wide, range, of, end, applications, including, in, domestic, acidic, drain, cleaners, as, an, electrolyte, in, lead, acid, batteries, as, a, dehydrating, compound, and, in, various, cleaning, agents, sulfuric, acid, can, be, obtained, by, dissolving, sulfur, trioxide, in, water, although, nearly, 100, sulfuric, acid, solutions, can, be, made, the, subsequent, loss, of, so, 3, at, the, boiling, point, brings, the, concentration, to, 98, 3, acid, the, 98, 3, grade, which, is, more, stable, in, storage, is, the, usual, form, of, what, is, described, as, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, other, concentrations, are, used, for, different, purposes, some, common, concentrations, are, chamber, acid, and, tower, acid, were, the, two, concentrations, of, sulfuric, acid, produced, by, the, lead, chamber, process, chamber, acid, being, the, acid, produced, in, the, lead, chamber, itself, 70, to, avoid, contamination, with, nitrosylsulfuric, acid, and, tower, acid, being, the, acid, recovered, from, the, bottom, of, the, glover, tower, they, are, now, obsolete, as, commercial, concentrations, of, sulfuric, acid, although, they, may, be, prepared, in, the, laboratory, from, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, if, needed, in, particular, 10, m, sulfuric, acid, the, modern, equivalent, of, chamber, acid, used, in, many, titrations, is, prepared, by, slowly, adding, 98, sulfuric, acid, to, an, equal, volume, of, water, with, good, stirring, the, temperature, of, the, mixture, can, rise, to, 80, c, 176, f, or, higher, sulfuric, acid, contains, not, only, h, 2, so, 4, molecules, but, is, actually, an, equilibrium, of, many, other, chemical, species, as, it, is, shown, in, the, table, below, sulfuric, acid, is, a, colorless, oily, liquid, and, has, a, vapor, pressure, of, 0, 001, mmhg, at, 25, c, and, 1, mmhg, at, 145, 8, c, and, 98, sulfuric, acid, has, a, vapor, pressure, of, 1, mmhg, at, 40, c, in, the, solid, state, sulfuric, acid, is, a, molecular, solid, that, forms, monoclinic, crystals, with, nearly, trigonal, lattice, parameters, the, structure, consists, of, layers, parallel, to, the, 010, plane, in, which, each, molecule, is, connected, by, hydrogen, bonds, to, two, others, hydrates, h, 2, so, 4, n, h, 2, o, are, known, for, n, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5, and, 8, although, most, intermediate, hydrates, are, stable, against, disproportionation, anhydrous, h, 2, so, 4, is, a, very, polar, liquid, having, a, dielectric, constant, of, around, 100, it, has, a, high, electrical, conductivity, a, consequence, of, autoprotolysis, i, e, self, protonation, the, equilibrium, constant, for, autoprotolysis, 25, c, is, the, corresponding, equilibrium, constant, for, water, k, w, is, 10, 14, a, factor, of, 10, 10, 10, billion, smaller, in, spite, of, the, viscosity, of, the, acid, the, effective, conductivities, of, the, h, 3, so, 4, and, hso, 4, ions, are, high, due, to, an, intramolecular, proton, switch, mechanism, analogous, to, the, grotthuss, mechanism, in, water, making, sulfuric, acid, a, good, conductor, of, electricity, it, is, also, an, excellent, solvent, for, many, reactions, the, hydration, reaction, of, sulfuric, acid, is, highly, exothermic, dilution, as, indicated, by, its, acid, dissociation, constant, sulfuric, acid, is, a, strong, acid, the, product, of, this, ionization, is, hso, 4, the, bisulfate, anion, bisulfate, is, a, far, weaker, acid, the, product, of, this, second, dissociation, is, so, 2, 4, the, sulfate, anion, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, has, a, powerful, dehydrating, property, removing, water, h, 2, o, from, other, chemical, compounds, such, as, table, sugar, sucrose, and, other, carbohydrates, to, produce, carbon, steam, and, heat, dehydration, of, table, sugar, sucrose, is, a, common, laboratory, demonstration, the, sugar, darkens, as, carbon, is, formed, and, a, rigid, column, of, black, porous, carbon, called, a, carbon, snake, may, emerge, as, shown, in, the, figure, similarly, mixing, starch, into, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, gives, elemental, carbon, and, water, the, effect, of, this, can, be, seen, when, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, is, spilled, on, paper, which, is, composed, of, cellulose, the, cellulose, reacts, to, give, a, burnt, appearance, in, which, the, carbon, appears, much, like, soot, that, results, from, fire, although, less, dramatic, the, action, of, the, acid, on, cotton, even, in, diluted, form, destroys, the, fabric, the, reaction, with, copper, ii, sulfate, can, also, demonstrate, the, dehydration, property, of, sulfuric, acid, the, blue, crystals, change, into, white, powder, as, water, is, removed, sulfuric, acid, reacts, with, most, bases, to, give, the, corresponding, sulfate, or, bisulfate, sulfuric, acid, reacts, with, sodium, chloride, and, gives, hydrogen, chloride, gas, and, sodium, bisulfate, aluminium, sulfate, also, known, as, paper, maker, s, alum, is, made, by, treating, bauxite, with, sulfuric, acid, sulfuric, acid, can, also, be, used, to, displace, weaker, acids, from, their, salts, reaction, with, sodium, acetate, for, example, displaces, acetic, acid, ch, 3, cooh, and, forms, sodium, bisulfate, similarly, treating, potassium, nitrate, with, sulfuric, acid, produces, nitric, acid, when, combined, with, nitric, acid, sulfuric, acid, acts, both, as, an, acid, and, a, dehydrating, agent, forming, the, nitronium, ion, no, 2, which, is, important, in, nitration, reactions, involving, electrophilic, aromatic, substitution, this, type, of, reaction, where, protonation, occurs, on, an, oxygen, atom, is, important, in, many, organic, chemistry, reactions, such, as, fischer, esterification, and, dehydration, of, alcohols, when, allowed, to, react, with, superacids, sulfuric, acid, can, act, as, a, base, and, can, be, protonated, forming, the, ion, salts, of, have, been, prepared, e, g, trihydroxyoxosulfonium, hexafluoroantimonate, v, using, the, following, reaction, in, liquid, hf, the, above, reaction, is, thermodynamically, favored, due, to, the, high, bond, enthalpy, of, the, si, f, bond, in, the, side, product, protonation, using, simply, fluoroantimonic, acid, however, has, met, with, failure, as, pure, sulfuric, acid, undergoes, self, ionization, to, give, ions, which, prevents, the, conversion, of, h, 2, so, 4, to, by, the, hf, sbf, 5, system, even, dilute, sulfuric, acid, reacts, with, many, metals, via, a, single, displacement, reaction, like, other, typical, acids, producing, hydrogen, gas, and, salts, the, metal, sulfate, it, attacks, reactive, metals, metals, at, positions, above, copper, in, the, reactivity, series, such, as, iron, aluminium, zinc, manganese, magnesium, and, nickel, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, can, serve, as, an, oxidizing, agent, releasing, sulfur, dioxide, lead, and, tungsten, however, are, resistant, to, sulfuric, acid, hot, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, oxidizes, carbon, as, bituminous, coal, and, sulfur, benzene, undergoes, electrophilic, aromatic, substitution, with, sulfuric, acid, to, give, the, corresponding, sulfonic, acids, sulfuric, acid, can, be, used, to, produce, hydrogen, from, water, the, compounds, of, sulfur, and, iodine, are, recovered, and, reused, hence, the, process, is, called, the, sulfur, iodine, cycle, this, process, is, endothermic, and, must, occur, at, high, temperatures, so, energy, in, the, form, of, heat, has, to, be, supplied, the, sulfur, iodine, cycle, has, been, proposed, as, a, way, to, supply, hydrogen, for, a, hydrogen, based, economy, it, is, an, alternative, to, electrolysis, and, does, not, require, hydrocarbons, like, current, methods, of, steam, reforming, but, note, that, all, of, the, available, energy, in, the, hydrogen, so, produced, is, supplied, by, the, heat, used, to, make, it, sulfuric, acid, is, rarely, encountered, naturally, on, earth, in, anhydrous, form, due, to, its, great, affinity, for, water, dilute, sulfuric, acid, is, a, constituent, of, acid, rain, which, is, formed, by, atmospheric, oxidation, of, sulfur, dioxide, in, the, presence, of, water, i, e, oxidation, of, sulfurous, acid, when, sulfur, containing, fuels, such, as, coal, or, oil, are, burned, sulfur, dioxide, is, the, main, byproduct, besides, the, chief, products, carbon, oxides, and, water, sulfuric, acid, is, formed, naturally, by, the, oxidation, of, sulfide, minerals, such, as, pyrite, the, resulting, highly, acidic, water, is, called, acid, mine, drainage, amd, or, acid, rock, drainage, ard, the, fe, 2, can, be, further, oxidized, to, fe, 3, the, fe, 3, produced, can, be, precipitated, as, the, hydroxide, or, hydrous, iron, oxide, the, iron, iii, ion, ferric, iron, can, also, oxidize, pyrite, when, iron, iii, oxidation, of, pyrite, occurs, the, process, can, become, rapid, ph, values, below, zero, have, been, measured, in, ard, produced, by, this, process, ard, can, also, produce, sulfuric, acid, at, a, slower, rate, so, that, the, acid, neutralizing, capacity, anc, of, the, aquifer, can, neutralize, the, produced, acid, in, such, cases, the, total, dissolved, solids, tds, concentration, of, the, water, can, be, increased, from, the, dissolution, of, minerals, from, the, acid, neutralization, reaction, with, the, minerals, sulfuric, acid, is, used, as, a, defense, by, certain, marine, species, for, example, the, phaeophyte, alga, desmarestia, munda, order, desmarestiales, concentrates, sulfuric, acid, in, cell, vacuoles, in, the, stratosphere, the, atmosphere, s, second, layer, that, is, generally, between, 10, and, 50, km, above, earth, s, surface, sulfuric, acid, is, formed, by, the, oxidation, of, volcanic, sulfur, dioxide, by, the, hydroxyl, radical, because, sulfuric, acid, reaches, supersaturation, in, the, stratosphere, it, can, nucleate, aerosol, particles, and, provide, a, surface, for, aerosol, growth, via, condensation, and, coagulation, with, other, water, sulfuric, acid, aerosols, this, results, in, the, stratospheric, aerosol, layer, the, permanent, venusian, clouds, produce, a, concentrated, acid, rain, as, the, clouds, in, the, atmosphere, of, earth, produce, water, rain, jupiter, s, moon, europa, is, also, thought, to, have, an, atmosphere, containing, sulfuric, acid, hydrates, sulfuric, acid, is, produced, from, sulfur, oxygen, and, water, via, the, conventional, contact, process, dcda, or, the, wet, sulfuric, acid, process, wsa, in, the, first, step, sulfur, is, burned, to, produce, sulfur, dioxide, the, sulfur, dioxide, is, oxidized, to, sulfur, trioxide, by, oxygen, in, the, presence, of, a, vanadium, v, oxide, catalyst, this, reaction, is, reversible, and, the, formation, of, the, sulfur, trioxide, is, exothermic, the, sulfur, trioxide, is, absorbed, into, 97, 98, h, 2, so, 4, to, form, oleum, h, 2, s, 2, o, 7, also, known, as, fuming, sulfuric, acid, or, pyrosulphuric, acid, the, oleum, is, then, diluted, with, water, to, form, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, directly, dissolving, so, 3, in, water, called, the, wet, sulfuric, acid, process, is, rarely, practiced, because, the, reaction, is, extremely, exothermic, resulting, in, a, hot, aerosol, of, sulfuric, acid, that, requires, condensation, and, separation, in, the, first, step, sulfur, is, burned, to, produce, sulfur, dioxide, or, alternatively, hydrogen, sulfide, h, 2, s, gas, is, incinerated, to, so, 2, gas, the, sulfur, dioxide, then, oxidized, to, sulfur, trioxide, using, oxygen, with, vanadium, v, oxide, as, catalyst, the, sulfur, trioxide, is, hydrated, into, sulfuric, acid, h, 2, so, 4, the, last, step, is, the, condensation, of, the, sulfuric, acid, to, liquid, 97, 98, h, 2, so, 4, a, method, that, is, less, well, known, is, the, metabisulfite, method, in, which, metabisulfite, is, placed, at, the, bottom, of, a, beaker, and, 12, 6, molar, concentration, hydrochloric, acid, is, added, the, resulting, gas, is, bubbled, through, nitric, acid, which, will, release, brown, red, vapors, of, nitrogen, dioxide, as, the, reaction, proceeds, the, completion, of, the, reaction, is, indicated, by, the, ceasing, of, the, fumes, this, method, does, not, produce, an, inseparable, mist, which, is, quite, convenient, burning, sulfur, together, with, saltpeter, potassium, nitrate, kno, 3, in, the, presence, of, steam, has, been, used, historically, as, saltpeter, decomposes, it, oxidizes, the, sulfur, to, so, 3, which, combines, with, water, to, produce, sulfuric, acid, alternatively, dissolving, sulfur, dioxide, in, an, aqueous, solution, of, an, oxidizing, metal, salt, such, as, copper, ii, or, iron, iii, chloride, two, less, well, known, laboratory, methods, of, producing, sulfuric, acid, albeit, in, dilute, form, and, requiring, some, extra, effort, in, purification, a, solution, of, copper, ii, sulfate, can, be, electrolyzed, with, a, copper, cathode, and, platinum, graphite, anode, to, give, spongy, copper, at, cathode, and, evolution, of, oxygen, gas, at, the, anode, the, solution, of, dilute, sulfuric, acid, indicates, completion, of, the, reaction, when, it, turns, from, blue, to, clear, production, of, hydrogen, at, cathode, is, another, sign, more, costly, dangerous, and, troublesome, yet, novel, is, the, electrobromine, method, which, employs, a, mixture, of, sulfur, water, and, hydrobromic, acid, as, the, electrolytic, solution, the, sulfur, is, pushed, to, bottom, of, container, under, the, acid, solution, then, the, copper, cathode, and, platinum, graphite, anode, are, used, with, the, cathode, near, the, surface, and, the, anode, is, positioned, at, the, bottom, of, the, electrolyte, to, apply, the, current, this, may, take, longer, and, emits, toxic, bromine, sulfur, bromide, vapors, but, the, reactant, acid, is, recyclable, overall, only, the, sulfur, and, water, are, converted, to, sulfuric, acid, and, hydrogen, omitting, losses, of, acid, as, vapors, prior, to, 1900, most, sulfuric, acid, was, manufactured, by, the, lead, chamber, process, as, late, as, 1940, up, to, 50, of, sulfuric, acid, manufactured, in, the, united, states, was, produced, by, chamber, process, plants, in, the, early, to, mid, 19th, century, vitriol, plants, existed, among, other, places, in, prestonpans, in, scotland, shropshire, and, the, lagan, valley, in, county, antrim, ireland, where, it, was, used, as, a, bleach, for, linen, early, bleaching, of, linen, was, done, using, lactic, acid, from, sour, milk, but, this, was, a, slow, process, and, the, use, of, vitriol, sped, up, the, bleaching, process, sulfuric, acid, is, a, very, important, commodity, chemical, and, indeed, a, nation, s, sulfuric, acid, production, is, a, good, indicator, of, its, industrial, strength, world, production, in, the, year, 2004, was, about, 180, million, tonnes, with, the, following, geographic, distribution, asia, 35, north, america, including, mexico, 24, africa, 11, western, europe, 10, eastern, europe, and, russia, 10, australia, and, oceania, 7, south, america, 7, most, of, this, amount, 60, is, consumed, for, fertilizers, particularly, superphosphates, ammonium, phosphate, and, ammonium, sulfates, about, 20, is, used, in, chemical, industry, for, production, of, detergents, synthetic, resins, dyestuffs, pharmaceuticals, petroleum, catalysts, insecticides, and, antifreeze, as, well, as, in, various, processes, such, as, oil, well, acidicizing, aluminium, reduction, paper, sizing, and, water, treatment, about, 6, of, uses, are, related, to, pigments, and, include, paints, enamels, printing, inks, coated, fabrics, and, paper, while, the, rest, is, dispersed, into, a, multitude, of, applications, such, as, production, of, explosives, cellophane, acetate, and, viscose, textiles, lubricants, non, ferrous, metals, and, batteries, the, dominant, use, for, sulfuric, acid, is, in, the, wet, method, for, the, production, of, phosphoric, acid, used, for, manufacture, of, phosphate, fertilizers, in, this, method, phosphate, rock, is, used, and, more, than, 100, million, tonnes, are, processed, annually, this, raw, material, is, shown, below, as, fluorapatite, though, the, exact, composition, may, vary, this, is, treated, with, 93, sulfuric, acid, to, produce, calcium, sulfate, hydrogen, fluoride, hf, and, phosphoric, acid, the, hf, is, removed, as, hydrofluoric, acid, the, overall, process, can, be, represented, as, ammonium, sulfate, an, important, nitrogen, fertilizer, is, most, commonly, produced, as, a, byproduct, from, coking, plants, supplying, the, iron, and, steel, making, plants, reacting, the, ammonia, produced, in, the, thermal, decomposition, of, coal, with, waste, sulfuric, acid, allows, the, ammonia, to, be, crystallized, out, as, a, salt, often, brown, because, of, iron, contamination, and, sold, into, the, agro, chemicals, industry, sulfuric, acid, is, also, important, in, the, manufacture, of, dyestuffs, solutions, sulfuric, acid, is, used, in, steelmaking, and, other, metallurgical, industries, as, a, pickling, agent, for, removal, of, rust, and, fouling, used, acid, is, often, recycled, using, a, spent, acid, regeneration, sar, plant, these, plants, combust, spent, acid, with, natural, gas, refinery, gas, fuel, oil, or, other, fuel, sources, this, combustion, process, produces, gaseous, sulfur, dioxide, so, 2, and, sulfur, trioxide, so, 3, which, are, then, used, to, manufacture, new, sulfuric, acid, hydrogen, peroxide, h, 2, o, 2, can, be, added, to, sulfuric, acid, to, produce, piranha, solution, a, powerful, but, very, toxic, cleaning, solution, with, which, substrate, surfaces, can, be, cleaned, piranha, solution, is, typically, used, in, the, microelectronics, industry, and, also, in, laboratory, settings, to, clean, glassware, sulfuric, acid, is, used, for, a, variety, of, other, purposes, in, the, chemical, industry, for, example, it, is, the, usual, acid, catalyst, for, the, conversion, of, cyclohexanone, oxime, to, caprolactam, used, for, making, nylon, it, is, used, for, making, hydrochloric, acid, from, salt, via, the, mannheim, process, much, h, 2, so, 4, is, used, in, petroleum, refining, for, example, as, a, catalyst, for, the, reaction, of, isobutane, with, isobutylene, to, give, isooctane, a, compound, that, raises, the, octane, rating, of, gasoline, petrol, sulfuric, acid, is, also, often, used, as, a, dehydrating, or, oxidizing, agent, in, industrial, reactions, such, as, the, dehydration, of, various, sugars, to, form, solid, carbon, sulfuric, acid, acts, as, the, electrolyte, in, lead, acid, batteries, lead, acid, accumulator, at, anode, at, cathode, overall, sulfuric, acid, at, high, concentrations, is, frequently, the, major, ingredient, in, domestic, acidic, drain, cleaners, which, are, used, to, remove, grease, hair, tissue, paper, etc, similar, to, their, alkaline, versions, such, drain, openers, can, dissolve, fats, and, proteins, via, hydrolysis, moreover, as, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, has, a, strong, dehydrating, property, it, can, remove, tissue, paper, via, dehydrating, process, as, well, since, the, acid, may, react, with, water, vigorously, such, acidic, drain, openers, should, be, added, slowly, into, the, pipe, to, be, cleaned, the, study, of, vitriols, hydrated, sulfates, of, various, metals, forming, glassy, minerals, from, which, sulfuric, acid, can, be, derived, began, in, ancient, times, sumerians, had, a, list, of, types, of, vitriol, that, they, classified, according, to, the, substances, color, some, of, the, earliest, discussions, on, the, origin, and, properties, of, vitriol, is, in, the, works, of, the, greek, physician, dioscorides, first, century, ad, and, the, roman, naturalist, pliny, the, elder, 23, 79, ad, galen, also, discussed, its, medical, use, metallurgical, uses, for, vitriolic, substances, were, recorded, in, the, hellenistic, alchemical, works, of, zosimos, of, panopolis, in, the, treatise, phisica, et, mystica, and, the, leyden, papyrus, x, medieval, islamic, chemists, like, the, authors, writing, under, the, name, of, jabir, ibn, hayyan, died, c, 806, c, 816, ad, known, in, latin, as, geber, abu, bakr, al, razi, 865, 925, ad, known, in, latin, as, rhazes, ibn, sina, 980, 1037, ad, known, in, latin, as, avicenna, and, muhammad, ibn, ibrahim, al, watwat, 1234, 1318, ad, included, vitriol, in, their, mineral, classification, lists, the, jabirian, authors, and, al, razi, experimented, extensively, with, the, distillation, of, various, substances, including, vitriols, in, one, recipe, recorded, in, his, kit, b, al, asr, r, book, of, secrets, al, razi, may, have, created, sulfuric, acid, without, being, aware, of, it, take, white, yemeni, alum, dissolve, it, and, purify, it, by, filtration, then, distil, green, vitriol, with, copper, green, the, acetate, and, mix, the, distillate, with, the, filtered, solution, of, the, purified, alum, afterwards, let, it, solidify, or, crystallise, in, the, glass, beaker, you, will, get, the, best, qalqadis, white, alum, that, may, be, had, in, an, anonymous, latin, work, variously, attributed, to, aristotle, under, the, title, liber, aristotilis, book, of, aristotle, to, al, razi, under, the, title, lumen, luminum, magnum, great, light, of, lights, or, to, ibn, sina, the, author, speaks, of, an, oil, oleum, obtained, through, the, distillation, of, iron, ii, sulfate, green, vitriol, which, was, likely, oil, of, vitriol, or, sulfuric, acid, the, work, refers, multiple, times, to, jabir, ibn, hayyan, s, book, of, seventy, liber, de, septuaginta, one, of, the, few, arabic, jabir, works, that, were, translated, into, latin, the, author, of, the, version, attributed, to, al, razi, also, refers, to, the, liber, de, septuaginta, as, his, own, work, showing, that, he, erroneously, believed, the, liber, de, septuaginta, to, be, a, work, by, al, razi, there, are, several, indications, that, the, anonymous, work, was, an, original, composition, in, latin, although, according, to, one, manuscript, it, was, translated, by, a, certain, raymond, of, marseilles, meaning, that, it, may, also, have, been, a, translation, from, the, arabic, according, to, ahmad, y, al, hassan, three, recipes, for, sulfuric, acid, occur, in, an, anonymous, karshuni, manuscript, containing, a, compilation, taken, from, several, authors, and, dating, from, before, c, 1100, ad, one, of, them, runs, as, follows, the, water, of, vitriol, and, sulphur, which, is, used, to, irrigate, the, drugs, yellow, vitriol, three, parts, yellow, sulphur, one, part, grind, them, and, distil, them, in, the, manner, of, rose, water, a, recipe, for, the, preparation, of, sulfuric, acid, is, mentioned, in, ris, lat, ja, far, al, s, diq, f, ilm, al, an, a, an, arabic, treatise, falsely, attributed, to, the, shi, i, imam, ja, far, al, sadiq, died, 765, julius, ruska, dated, this, treatise, to, the, 13th, century, but, according, to, ahmad, y, al, hassan, it, likely, dates, from, an, earlier, period, then, distil, green, vitriol, in, a, cucurbit, and, alembic, using, medium, fire, take, what, you, obtain, from, the, distillate, and, you, will, find, it, clear, with, a, greenish, tint, sulfuric, acid, was, called, oil, of, vitriol, by, medieval, european, alchemists, because, it, was, prepared, by, roasting, iron, ii, sulfate, or, green, vitriol, in, an, iron, retort, the, first, allusions, to, it, in, works, that, are, european, in, origin, appear, in, the, thirteenth, century, ad, as, for, example, in, the, works, of, vincent, of, beauvais, in, the, compositum, de, compositis, ascribed, to, albertus, magnus, and, in, pseudo, geber, s, summa, perfectionis, a, method, of, producing, oleum, sulphuris, per, campanam, or, oil, of, sulfur, by, the, bell, was, known, by, the, 16th, century, it, involved, burning, sulfur, under, a, glass, bell, in, moist, weather, or, later, under, a, moistened, bell, however, it, was, very, inefficient, according, to, gesner, 5, pounds, 2, 3, kg, of, sulfur, converted, into, less, than, 1, ounce, 0, 03, kg, of, acid, and, the, resulting, product, was, contaminated, by, sulfurous, acid, or, rather, solution, of, sulfur, dioxide, so, most, alchemists, including, for, example, isaac, newton, didn, t, consider, it, equivalent, with, the, oil, of, vitriol, in, the, 17th, century, johann, glauber, discovered, that, adding, saltpeter, potassium, nitrate, kno, 3, significantly, improves, the, output, also, replacing, moisture, with, steam, as, saltpeter, decomposes, it, oxidizes, the, sulfur, to, so, 3, which, combines, with, water, to, produce, sulfuric, acid, in, 1736, joshua, ward, a, london, pharmacist, used, this, method, to, begin, the, first, large, scale, production, of, sulfuric, acid, in, 1746, in, birmingham, john, roebuck, adapted, this, method, to, produce, sulfuric, acid, in, lead, lined, chambers, which, were, stronger, less, expensive, and, could, be, made, larger, than, the, previously, used, glass, containers, this, process, allowed, the, effective, industrialization, of, sulfuric, acid, production, after, several, refinements, this, method, called, the, lead, chamber, process, or, chamber, process, remained, the, standard, for, sulfuric, acid, production, for, almost, two, centuries, sulfuric, acid, created, by, john, roebuck, s, process, approached, a, 65, concentration, later, refinements, to, the, lead, chamber, process, by, french, chemist, joseph, louis, gay, lussac, and, british, chemist, john, glover, improved, concentration, to, 78, however, the, manufacture, of, some, dyes, and, other, chemical, processes, require, a, more, concentrated, product, throughout, the, 18th, century, this, could, only, be, made, by, dry, distilling, minerals, in, a, technique, similar, to, the, original, alchemical, processes, pyrite, iron, disulfide, fes, 2, was, heated, in, air, to, yield, iron, ii, sulfate, feso, 4, which, was, oxidized, by, further, heating, in, air, to, form, iron, iii, sulfate, fe, 2, so, 4, 3, which, when, heated, to, 480, c, decomposed, to, iron, iii, oxide, and, sulfur, trioxide, which, could, be, passed, through, water, to, yield, sulfuric, acid, in, any, concentration, however, the, expense, of, this, process, prevented, the, large, scale, use, of, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, in, 1831, british, vinegar, merchant, peregrine, phillips, patented, the, contact, process, which, was, a, far, more, economical, process, for, producing, sulfur, trioxide, and, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, today, nearly, all, of, the, world, s, sulfuric, acid, is, produced, using, this, method, sulfuric, acid, is, capable, of, causing, very, severe, burns, especially, when, it, is, at, high, concentrations, in, common, with, other, corrosive, acids, and, alkali, it, readily, decomposes, proteins, and, lipids, through, amide, and, ester, hydrolysis, upon, contact, with, living, tissues, such, as, skin, and, flesh, in, addition, it, exhibits, a, strong, dehydrating, property, on, carbohydrates, liberating, extra, heat, and, causing, secondary, thermal, burns, accordingly, it, rapidly, attacks, the, cornea, and, can, induce, permanent, blindness, if, splashed, onto, eyes, if, ingested, it, damages, internal, organs, irreversibly, and, may, even, be, fatal, protective, equipment, should, hence, always, be, used, when, handling, it, moreover, its, strong, oxidizing, property, makes, it, highly, corrosive, to, many, metals, and, may, extend, its, destruction, on, other, materials, because, of, such, reasons, damage, posed, by, sulfuric, acid, is, potentially, more, severe, than, that, by, other, comparable, strong, acids, such, as, hydrochloric, acid, and, nitric, acid, sulfuric, acid, must, be, stored, carefully, in, containers, made, of, nonreactive, material, such, as, glass, solutions, equal, to, or, stronger, than, 1, 5, m, are, labeled, corrosive, while, solutions, greater, than, 0, 5, m, but, less, than, 1, 5, m, are, labeled, irritant, however, even, the, normal, laboratory, dilute, grade, approximately, 1, m, 10, will, char, paper, if, left, in, contact, for, a, sufficient, time, the, standard, first, aid, treatment, for, acid, spills, on, the, skin, is, as, for, other, corrosive, agents, irrigation, with, large, quantities, of, water, washing, is, continued, for, at, least, ten, to, fifteen, minutes, to, cool, the, tissue, surrounding, the, acid, burn, and, to, prevent, secondary, damage, contaminated, clothing, is, removed, immediately, and, the, underlying, skin, washed, thoroughly, preparation, of, diluted, acid, can, be, dangerous, due, to, the, heat, released, in, the, dilution, process, to, avoid, splattering, the, concentrated, acid, is, usually, added, to, water, and, not, the, other, way, around, a, saying, used, to, remember, this, is, do, like, you, oughta, add, the, acid, to, the, water, water, has, a, higher, heat, capacity, than, the, acid, and, so, a, vessel, of, cold, water, will, absorb, heat, as, acid, is, added, also, because, the, acid, is, denser, than, water, it, sinks, to, the, bottom, heat, is, generated, at, the, interface, between, acid, and, water, which, is, at, the, bottom, of, the, vessel, acid, will, not, boil, because, of, its, higher, boiling, point, warm, water, near, the, interface, rises, due, to, convection, which, cools, the, interface, and, prevents, boiling, of, either, acid, or, water, in, contrast, addition, of, water, to, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, results, in, a, thin, layer, of, water, on, top, of, the, acid, heat, generated, in, this, thin, layer, of, water, can, boil, leading, to, the, dispersal, of, a, sulfuric, acid, aerosol, or, worse, an, explosion, preparation, of, solutions, greater, than, 6, m, 35, in, concentration, is, dangerous, unless, the, acid, is, added, slowly, enough, to, allow, the, mixture, sufficient, time, to, cool, otherwise, the, heat, produced, may, be, sufficient, to, boil, the, mixture, efficient, mechanical, stirring, and, external, cooling, such, as, an, ice, bath, are, essential, reaction, rates, double, for, about, every, 10, degree, celsius, increase, in, temperature, therefore, the, reaction, will, become, more, violent, as, dilution, proceeds, unless, the, mixture, is, given, time, to, cool, adding, acid, to, warm, water, will, cause, a, violent, reaction, on, a, laboratory, scale, sulfuric, acid, can, be, diluted, by, pouring, concentrated, acid, onto, crushed, ice, made, from, de, ionized, water, the, ice, melts, in, an, endothermic, process, while, dissolving, the, acid, the, amount, of, heat, needed, to, melt, the, ice, in, this, process, is, greater, than, the, amount, of, heat, evolved, by, dissolving, the, acid, so, the, solution, remains, cold, after, all, the, ice, has, melted, further, dilution, can, take, place, using, water, sulfuric, acid, is, non, flammable, the, main, occupational, risks, posed, by, this, acid, are, skin, contact, leading, to, burns, see, above, and, the, inhalation, of, aerosols, exposure, to, aerosols, at, high, concentrations, leads, to, immediate, and, severe, irritation, of, the, eyes, respiratory, tract, and, mucous, membranes, this, ceases, rapidly, after, exposure, although, there, is, a, risk, of, subsequent, pulmonary, edema, if, tissue, damage, has, been, more, severe, at, lower, concentrations, the, most, commonly, reported, symptom, of, chronic, exposure, to, sulfuric, acid, aerosols, is, erosion, of, the, teeth, found, in, virtually, all, studies, indications, of, possible, chronic, damage, to, the, respiratory, tract, are, inconclusive, as, of, 1997, repeated, occupational, exposure, to, sulfuric, acid, mists, may, increase, the, chance, of, lung, cancer, by, up, to, 64, percent, in, the, united, states, the, permissible, exposure, limit, pel, for, sulfuric, acid, is, fixed, at, 1, mg, m, 3, limits, in, other, countries, are, similar, there, have, been, reports, of, sulfuric, acid, ingestion, leading, to, vitamin, b12, deficiency, with, subacute, combined, degeneration, the, spinal, cord, is, most, often, affected, in, such, cases, but, the, optic, nerves, may, show, demyelination, loss, of, axons, and, gliosis, international, commerce, of, sulfuric, acid, is, controlled, under, the, united, nations, convention, against, illicit, traffic, in, narcotic, drugs, and, psychotropic, substances, 1988, which, lists, sulfuric, acid, under, table, ii, of, the, convention, as, a, chemical, frequently, used, in, the, illicit, manufacture, of, narcotic, drugs, or, psychotropic, substances
