the, triangulum, galaxy, is, a, spiral, galaxy, 2, 73, million, light, years, ly, from, earth, in, the, constellation, triangulum, it, is, catalogued, as, messier, 33, or, ngc, new, general, catalogue, 598, with, the, d, 25, isophotal, diameter, of, 18, 74, kiloparsecs, 61, 100, light, years, the, triangulum, galaxy, is, the, third, largest, member, of, the, local, group, of, galaxies, behind, the, andromeda, galaxy, and, the, milky, way, the, galaxy, is, the, second, smallest, spiral, galaxy, in, the, local, group, after, the, large, magellanic, cloud, which, is, a, magellanic, type, spiral, galaxy, it, is, believed, to, be, a, satellite, of, the, andromeda, galaxy, or, on, its, rebound, into, the, latter, due, to, their, interactions, velocities, and, proximity, to, one, another, in, the, night, sky, it, also, has, an, h, ii, nucleus, the, galaxy, gets, its, name, from, the, constellation, triangulum, where, it, can, be, spotted, it, is, sometimes, informally, referred, to, as, the, pinwheel, galaxy, by, some, astronomy, references, in, some, computerized, telescope, software, and, in, some, public, outreach, websites, however, the, simbad, astronomical, database, a, professional, database, collates, formal, designations, for, astronomical, objects, and, indicates, that, pinwheel, galaxy, refers, to, messier, 101, which, several, amateur, astronomy, resources, including, public, outreach, websites, identify, by, that, name, and, that, is, within, the, bounds, of, ursa, major, under, exceptionally, good, viewing, conditions, with, no, light, pollution, the, triangulum, galaxy, can, be, seen, by, some, people, with, the, fully, dark, adapted, naked, eye, to, those, viewers, it, is, the, farthest, permanent, entity, visible, without, magnification, being, about, half, again, as, distant, as, messier, 31, the, andromeda, galaxy, it, is, a, diffuse, or, extended, object, rather, than, a, starlike, point, even, without, magnification, because, of, its, physical, extent, its, observability, without, optical, aid, ranges, from, being, relatively, easily, seen, by, people, using, direct, vision, in, deep, rural, locations, under, a, dark, clear, transparent, sky, to, requiring, use, of, averted, vision, by, observers, in, locations, beyond, the, suburbs, in, shallow, rural, areas, under, good, viewing, conditions, it, is, one, of, the, reference, objects, of, the, bortle, dark, sky, scale, crumey, has, shown, that, although, the, total, apparent, v, magnitude, of, m33, is, 5, 72, it, has, an, effective, visual, magnitude, of, approximately, 6, 6, meaning, that, a, precondition, for, visibility, is, that, the, observer, can, see, stars, at, least, as, faint, as, that, latter, figure, this, is, fainter, than, many, people, are, able, to, see, even, at, a, very, dark, site, the, triangulum, galaxy, was, probably, discovered, by, the, italian, astronomer, giovanni, battista, hodierna, before, 1654, in, his, work, de, systemate, orbis, cometici, deque, admirandis, coeli, caracteribus, about, the, systematics, of, the, cometary, orbit, and, about, the, admirable, objects, of, the, sky, he, listed, it, as, a, cloud, like, nebulosity, or, obscuration, and, gave, the, cryptic, description, near, the, triangle, hinc, inde, this, is, in, reference, to, the, constellation, triangulum, as, a, pair, of, triangles, the, magnitude, of, the, object, matches, m33, so, it, is, most, likely, a, reference, to, the, triangulum, galaxy, the, galaxy, was, independently, discovered, by, charles, messier, on, the, night, of, august, 25, 26, 1764, it, was, published, in, his, catalog, of, nebulae, and, star, clusters, 1771, as, object, number, 33, hence, the, name, m33, when, william, herschel, compiled, his, extensive, catalog, of, nebulae, he, was, careful, not, to, include, most, of, the, objects, identified, by, messier, however, m33, was, an, exception, and, he, cataloged, this, object, on, september, 11, 1784, as, h, v, 17, herschel, also, cataloged, the, triangulum, galaxy, s, brightest, and, largest, h, ii, region, diffuse, emission, nebula, containing, ionized, hydrogen, as, h, iii, 150, separately, from, the, galaxy, itself, the, nebula, eventually, obtained, ngc, number, 604, as, seen, from, earth, ngc, 604, is, located, northeast, of, the, galaxy, s, central, core, it, is, one, of, the, largest, h, ii, regions, known, with, a, diameter, of, nearly, 1500, light, years, and, a, spectrum, similar, to, that, of, the, orion, nebula, herschel, also, noted, three, other, smaller, h, ii, regions, ngc, 588, 592, and, 595, it, was, among, the, first, spiral, nebulae, identified, as, such, by, lord, rosse, in, 1850, in, 1922, 23, john, charles, duncan, and, max, wolf, discovered, variable, stars, in, the, nebulae, edwin, hubble, showed, in, 1926, that, 35, of, these, stars, were, classical, cepheids, thereby, allowing, him, to, estimate, their, distances, the, results, were, consistent, with, the, concept, of, spiral, nebulae, being, independent, galactic, systems, of, gas, and, dust, rather, than, just, nebulae, in, the, milky, way, the, triangulum, galaxy, is, the, third, largest, member, of, the, local, group, of, galaxies, it, has, a, diameter, measured, through, the, d, 25, standard, the, isophote, where, the, surface, brightness, of, the, galaxy, reaches, 25, mag, arcsec, 2, to, be, about, 18, 74, kiloparsecs, 61, 100, light, years, making, it, roughly, 70, the, size, of, the, milky, way, it, may, be, a, gravitationally, bound, companion, of, the, andromeda, galaxy, triangulum, may, be, home, to, 40, billion, stars, compared, to, 400, billion, for, the, milky, way, and, 1, trillion, for, andromeda, the, disk, of, triangulum, has, an, estimated, mass, of, 3, 6, 10, 9, solar, masses, while, the, gas, component, is, about, 3, 2, 10, 9, solar, masses, thus, the, combined, mass, of, all, baryonic, matter, in, the, galaxy, may, be, 10, 10, solar, masses, the, contribution, of, the, dark, matter, component, out, to, a, radius, of, 55, 10, 3, ly, 17, kpc, is, equivalent, to, about, 5, 10, 10, solar, masses, estimates, of, the, distance, from, the, milky, way, to, the, triangulum, galaxy, range, from, 2, 380, 10, 3, to, 3, 070, 10, 3, ly, 730, to, 940, kpc, or, 2, 38, to, 3, 07, mly, with, most, estimates, since, the, year, 2000, lying, in, the, middle, portion, of, this, range, making, it, slightly, more, distant, than, the, andromeda, galaxy, at, 2, 540, 000, light, years, at, least, three, techniques, have, been, used, to, measure, distances, to, m, 33, using, the, cepheid, variable, method, an, estimate, of, 2, 770, 10, 3, 130, 10, 3, ly, 849, 40, kpc, was, achieved, in, 2004, in, the, same, year, the, tip, of, the, red, giant, branch, trgb, method, was, used, to, derive, a, distance, estimate, of, 2, 590, 10, 3, 80, 10, 3, ly, 794, 25, kpc, the, triangulum, galaxy, is, around, 750, 000, light, years, from, the, andromeda, galaxy, in, 2006, a, group, of, astronomers, announced, the, discovery, of, an, eclipsing, binary, star, in, the, triangulum, galaxy, by, studying, the, eclipses, of, the, stars, astronomers, were, able, to, measure, their, sizes, knowing, the, sizes, and, temperatures, of, the, stars, they, were, able, to, measure, the, absolute, magnitude, of, the, stars, when, the, visual, and, absolute, magnitudes, are, known, the, distance, to, the, star, can, be, measured, the, stars, lie, at, the, distance, of, 3, 070, 10, 3, 240, 10, 3, ly, 941, 74, kpc, the, average, of, 102, distance, estimates, published, since, 1987, gives, a, distance, modulus, of, 24, 69, or, 883, mpc, 2, 878, 000, light, years, the, triangulum, galaxy, is, a, source, of, h, 2, o, maser, emission, in, 2005, using, observations, of, two, water, masers, on, opposite, sides, of, triangulum, via, the, vlba, researchers, were, for, the, first, time, able, to, estimate, the, angular, rotation, and, proper, motion, of, triangulum, a, velocity, of, 190, 60, km, s, relative, to, the, milky, way, was, computed, which, means, triangulum, is, moving, towards, andromeda, galaxy, and, suggesting, it, may, be, a, satellite, of, the, larger, galaxy, depending, on, their, relative, distances, and, margins, of, error, in, 2004, evidence, was, announced, of, a, clumpy, stream, of, hydrogen, gas, linking, the, andromeda, galaxy, with, triangulum, suggesting, that, the, two, may, have, tidally, interacted, in, the, past, this, discovery, was, confirmed, in, 2011, a, distance, of, less, than, 300, kiloparsecs, between, the, two, supports, this, hypothesis, the, pisces, dwarf, lgs, 3, one, of, the, small, local, group, member, galaxies, is, located, 2, 022, 10, 3, ly, 620, kpc, from, the, sun, it, is, 20, from, the, andromeda, galaxy, and, 11, from, triangulum, as, lgs, 3, lies, at, a, distance, of, 913, 10, 3, ly, 280, kpc, from, both, galaxies, it, could, be, a, satellite, galaxy, of, either, andromeda, or, triangulum, lgs, 3, has, a, core, radius, of, 483, ly, 148, pc, and, 2, 6, 10, 7, solar, masses, pisces, vii, triangulum, tri, iii, may, be, another, satellite, of, triangulum, in, the, french, astronomer, g, rard, de, vaucouleurs, revised, hubble, sandage, vrhs, system, of, galaxy, morphological, classification, the, triangulum, galaxy, is, classified, as, type, sa, s, cd, the, s, prefix, indicates, that, it, is, a, disk, shaped, galaxy, with, prominent, arms, of, gas, and, dust, that, spiral, out, from, the, nucleus, what, is, commonly, known, as, a, spiral, galaxy, the, a, is, assigned, when, the, galactic, nucleus, lacks, a, bar, shaped, structure, in, contrast, to, sb, class, barred, spiral, galaxies, american, astronomer, allan, sandage, s, s, notation, is, used, when, the, spiral, arms, emerge, directly, from, the, nucleus, or, central, bar, rather, than, from, an, inner, ring, as, with, an, r, type, galaxy, finally, the, cd, suffix, represents, a, stage, along, the, spiral, sequence, that, describes, the, openness, of, the, arms, a, rating, of, cd, indicates, relatively, loosely, wound, arms, this, galaxy, has, an, inclination, of, 54, to, the, line, of, sight, from, earth, allowing, the, structure, to, be, examined, without, significant, obstruction, by, gas, and, dust, the, disk, of, the, triangulum, galaxy, appears, warped, out, to, a, radius, of, about, 8, kpc, there, may, be, a, halo, surrounding, the, galaxy, but, there, is, no, bulge, at, the, nucleus, this, is, an, isolated, galaxy, and, there, are, no, indications, of, recent, mergers, or, interactions, with, other, galaxies, and, it, lacks, the, dwarf, spheroidals, or, tidal, tails, associated, with, the, milky, way, triangulum, is, classified, as, unbarred, but, an, analysis, of, the, galaxy, s, shape, shows, what, may, be, a, weak, bar, like, structure, about, the, galactic, nucleus, the, radial, extent, of, this, structure, is, about, 0, 8, kpc, the, nucleus, of, this, galaxy, is, an, h, ii, region, and, it, contains, an, ultraluminous, x, ray, source, with, an, emission, of, 1, 2, 10, 39, erg, s, 1, which, is, the, most, luminous, source, of, x, rays, in, the, local, group, of, galaxies, this, source, is, modulated, by, 20, over, a, 106, day, cycle, however, the, nucleus, does, not, appear, to, contain, a, supermassive, black, hole, as, a, best, fit, value, of, zero, mass, and, an, upper, limit, of, 1, 500, m, is, placed, on, the, mass, of, a, central, black, hole, based, on, models, and, the, hubble, space, telescope, hst, data, this, is, significantly, lower, than, the, mass, expected, from, the, velocity, dispersion, of, the, nucleus, and, far, below, any, mass, predicted, from, the, disk, kinematics, this, may, suggest, that, supermassive, black, holes, are, associated, only, with, galaxy, bulges, instead, of, with, their, disks, assuming, that, the, upper, limit, of, the, central, black, hole, is, correct, it, would, be, rather, an, intermediate, mass, black, hole, the, inner, part, of, the, galaxy, has, two, luminous, spiral, arms, along, with, multiple, spurs, that, connect, the, inner, to, the, outer, spiral, features, the, main, arms, are, designated, in, north, and, is, south, in, the, central, 4, region, of, this, galaxy, atomic, gas, is, being, efficiently, converted, to, molecular, gas, resulting, in, a, strong, spectral, emission, of, co, this, effect, occurs, as, giant, molecular, clouds, condense, out, of, the, surrounding, interstellar, medium, a, similar, process, is, taking, place, outside, the, central, 4, but, at, a, less, efficient, pace, about, 10, of, the, gas, content, in, this, galaxy, is, in, the, molecular, form, star, formation, is, taking, place, at, a, rate, that, is, strongly, correlated, with, local, gas, density, and, the, rate, per, unit, area, is, higher, than, in, the, neighboring, andromeda, galaxy, the, rate, of, star, formation, is, about, 3, 4, solar, masses, gyr, 1, pc, 2, in, the, triangulum, galaxy, compared, to, 0, 74, in, andromeda, the, total, integrated, rate, of, star, formation, in, the, triangulum, galaxy, is, about, 0, 45, 0, 1, solar, masses, per, year, it, is, uncertain, whether, this, net, rate, is, currently, decreasing, or, remaining, constant, based, on, analysis, of, the, chemical, composition, of, this, galaxy, it, appears, to, be, divided, into, two, distinct, components, with, differing, histories, the, inner, disk, within, a, radius, of, 30, 10, 3, ly, 9, kpc, has, a, typical, composition, gradient, that, decreases, linearly, from, the, core, beyond, this, radius, out, to, about, 82, 10, 3, ly, 25, kpc, the, gradient, is, much, flatter, this, suggests, a, different, star, formation, history, between, the, inner, disk, and, the, outer, disk, and, halo, and, may, be, explained, by, a, scenario, of, inside, out, galaxy, formation, this, occurs, when, gas, is, accumulated, at, large, radii, later, in, a, galaxy, s, life, space, while, the, gas, at, the, core, becomes, exhausted, the, result, is, a, decrease, in, the, average, age, of, stars, with, increasing, radius, from, the, galaxy, core, using, infrared, observations, from, the, spitzer, space, telescope, a, total, of, 515, discrete, candidate, sources, of, 24, m, emission, within, the, triangulum, galaxy, have, been, catalogued, as, of, 2007, the, brightest, sources, lie, within, the, central, region, of, the, galaxy, and, along, the, spiral, arms, many, of, the, emission, sources, are, associated, with, h, ii, regions, of, star, formation, the, four, brightest, hii, regions, are, designated, ngc, 588, ngc, 592, ngc, 595, and, ngc, 604, these, regions, are, associated, with, molecular, clouds, containing, 1, 2, 4, 10, 5, solar, masses, the, brightest, of, these, regions, ngc, 604, may, have, undergone, a, discrete, outburst, of, star, formation, about, three, million, years, ago, this, nebula, is, the, second, most, luminous, hii, region, within, the, local, group, of, galaxies, at, 4, 5, 1, 5, 10, 7, times, the, luminosity, of, the, sun, other, prominent, hii, regions, in, triangulum, include, ic, 132, ic, 133, and, ik, 53, the, northern, main, spiral, arm, contains, four, large, hii, regions, while, the, southern, arm, has, greater, concentrations, of, young, hot, stars, the, estimated, rate, of, supernova, explosions, in, the, triangulum, galaxy, is, 0, 06, type, ia, and, 0, 62, type, ib, type, ii, per, century, this, is, equivalent, to, a, supernova, explosion, every, 147, years, on, average, as, of, 2008, a, total, of, 100, supernova, remnants, have, been, identified, in, the, triangulum, galaxy, the, majority, of, which, lie, in, the, southern, half, of, the, spiral, galaxy, similar, asymmetries, exist, for, h, i, and, h, ii, regions, plus, highly, luminous, concentrations, of, massive, o, type, stars, the, center, of, the, distribution, of, these, features, is, offset, about, two, arc, minutes, to, the, southwest, m33, being, a, local, galaxy, the, central, bureau, for, astronomical, telegrams, cbat, tracks, novae, in, it, along, with, m31, and, m81, about, 54, globular, clusters, have, been, identified, in, this, galaxy, but, the, actual, number, may, be, 122, or, more, the, confirmed, clusters, may, be, several, billion, years, younger, than, globular, clusters, in, the, milky, way, and, cluster, formation, appears, to, have, increased, during, the, past, 100, million, years, this, increase, is, correlated, with, an, inflow, of, gas, into, the, center, of, the, galaxy, the, ultraviolet, emission, of, massive, stars, in, this, galaxy, matches, the, level, of, similar, stars, in, the, large, magellanic, cloud, in, 2007, a, black, hole, about, 15, 7, times, the, mass, of, the, sun, was, detected, in, this, galaxy, using, data, from, the, chandra, x, ray, observatory, the, black, hole, named, m33, x, 7, orbits, a, companion, star, which, it, eclipses, every, 3, 5, days, it, is, the, largest, stellar, mass, black, hole, known, unlike, the, milky, way, and, andromeda, galaxies, the, triangulum, galaxy, does, not, appear, to, have, a, supermassive, black, hole, at, its, center, this, may, be, because, the, mass, of, a, galaxy, s, central, supermassive, black, hole, correlates, with, the, size, of, the, galaxy, s, central, bulge, and, unlike, the, milky, way, and, andromeda, the, triangulum, galaxy, is, a, pure, disk, galaxy, with, no, bulge, as, mentioned, above, m33, is, linked, to, m31, by, several, streams, of, neutral, hydrogen, and, stars, which, suggests, that, a, past, interaction, between, these, two, galaxies, took, place, from, 2, to, 8, billion, years, ago, and, a, more, violent, encounter, will, occur, 2, 5, billion, years, in, the, future, the, fate, of, m33, was, uncertain, in, 2009, beyond, seeming, to, be, linked, to, its, larger, neighbor, m31, suggested, scenarios, include, being, torn, apart, and, absorbed, by, the, greater, companion, fueling, the, latter, with, hydrogen, to, form, new, stars, eventually, exhausting, all, of, its, gas, and, thus, the, ability, to, form, new, stars, or, participating, in, the, collision, between, the, milky, way, and, m31, likely, ending, up, orbiting, the, merger, product, and, fusing, with, it, much, later, two, other, possibilities, are, a, collision, with, the, milky, way, before, the, andromeda, galaxy, arrives, or, an, ejection, out, of, the, local, group, astrometric, data, from, gaia, appears, in, 2019, to, rule, out, the, possibility, that, m33, and, m31, are, in, orbit, if, correct, m33, is, on, its, first, infall, proper, into, the, andromeda, galaxy, m31
