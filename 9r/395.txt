tin, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, sn, from, latin, stannum, and, atomic, number, 50, a, silvery, colored, metal, tin, is, soft, enough, to, be, cut, with, little, force, and, a, bar, of, tin, can, be, bent, by, hand, with, little, effort, when, bent, the, so, called, tin, cry, can, be, heard, as, a, result, of, twinning, in, tin, crystals, tin, is, a, post, transition, metal, in, group, 14, of, the, periodic, table, of, elements, it, is, obtained, chiefly, from, the, mineral, cassiterite, which, contains, stannic, oxide, sno, 2, tin, shows, a, chemical, similarity, to, both, of, its, neighbors, in, group, 14, germanium, and, lead, and, has, two, main, oxidation, states, 2, and, the, slightly, more, stable, 4, tin, is, the, 49th, most, abundant, element, on, earth, and, has, with, 10, stable, isotopes, the, largest, number, of, stable, isotopes, in, the, periodic, table, due, to, its, magic, number, of, protons, it, has, two, main, allotropes, at, room, temperature, the, stable, allotrope, is, tin, a, silvery, white, malleable, metal, at, low, temperatures, it, is, less, dense, grey, tin, which, has, the, diamond, cubic, structure, metallic, tin, does, not, easily, oxidize, in, air, and, water, the, first, tin, alloy, used, on, a, large, scale, was, bronze, made, of, 1, 8, tin, and, 7, 8, copper, 12, 5, and, 87, 5, respectively, from, as, early, as, 3000, bc, after, 600, bc, pure, metallic, tin, was, produced, pewter, which, is, an, alloy, of, 85, 90, tin, with, the, remainder, commonly, consisting, of, copper, antimony, bismuth, and, sometimes, lead, and, silver, has, been, used, for, flatware, since, the, bronze, age, in, modern, times, tin, is, used, in, many, alloys, most, notably, tin, lead, soft, solders, which, are, typically, 60, or, more, tin, and, in, the, manufacture, of, transparent, electrically, conducting, films, of, indium, tin, oxide, in, optoelectronic, applications, another, large, application, is, corrosion, resistant, tin, plating, of, steel, because, of, the, low, toxicity, of, inorganic, tin, tin, plated, steel, is, widely, used, for, food, packaging, as, tin, cans, some, organotin, compounds, can, be, extremely, toxic, tin, is, a, soft, malleable, ductile, and, highly, crystalline, silvery, white, metal, when, a, bar, of, tin, is, bent, a, crackling, sound, known, as, the, tin, cry, can, be, heard, from, the, twinning, of, the, crystals, this, trait, is, shared, by, indium, cadmium, zinc, and, mercury, in, its, solid, state, tin, melts, at, about, 232, c, 450, f, the, lowest, in, group, 14, the, melting, point, is, further, lowered, to, 177, 3, c, 351, 1, f, for, 11, nm, particles, tin, also, called, white, tin, is, the, allotrope, structural, form, of, elemental, tin, that, is, stable, at, and, above, room, temperature, it, is, metallic, and, malleable, and, has, body, centered, tetragonal, crystal, structure, tin, or, gray, tin, is, the, nonmetallic, form, it, is, stable, below, 13, 2, c, 55, 8, f, and, is, brittle, tin, has, a, diamond, cubic, crystal, structure, as, do, diamond, and, silicon, tin, does, not, have, metallic, properties, because, its, atoms, form, a, covalent, structure, in, which, electrons, cannot, move, freely, tin, is, a, dull, gray, powdery, material, with, no, common, uses, other, than, specialized, semiconductor, applications, tin, and, tin, exist, at, temperatures, above, 161, c, 322, f, and, pressures, above, several, gpa, in, cold, conditions, tin, tends, to, transform, spontaneously, into, tin, a, phenomenon, known, as, tin, pest, or, tin, disease, some, unverifiable, sources, also, say, that, during, napoleon, s, russian, campaign, of, 1812, the, temperatures, became, so, cold, that, the, tin, buttons, on, the, soldiers, uniforms, disintegrated, over, time, contributing, to, the, defeat, of, the, grande, arm, e, a, persistent, legend, the, transformation, temperature, is, 13, 2, c, 55, 8, f, but, impurities, e, g, al, zn, etc, lower, it, well, below, 0, c, 32, f, with, the, addition, of, antimony, or, bismuth, the, transformation, might, not, occur, at, all, increasing, durability, commercial, grades, of, tin, 99, 8, tin, content, resist, transformation, because, of, the, inhibiting, effect, of, small, amounts, of, bismuth, antimony, lead, and, silver, present, as, impurities, alloying, elements, such, as, copper, antimony, bismuth, cadmium, and, silver, increase, the, hardness, of, tin, tin, easily, forms, hard, brittle, intermetallic, phases, that, are, typically, undesirable, it, does, not, mix, into, a, solution, with, most, metals, and, elements, so, tin, does, not, have, much, solid, solubility, tin, mixes, well, with, bismuth, gallium, lead, thallium, and, zinc, forming, simple, eutectic, systems, tin, becomes, a, superconductor, below, 3, 72, k, and, was, one, of, the, first, superconductors, to, be, studied, the, meissner, effect, one, of, the, characteristic, features, of, superconductors, was, first, discovered, in, superconducting, tin, crystals, tin, resists, corrosion, from, water, but, can, be, corroded, by, acids, and, alkalis, tin, can, be, highly, polished, and, is, used, as, a, protective, coat, for, other, metals, a, protective, oxide, passivation, layer, prevents, further, oxidation, tin, has, ten, stable, isotopes, the, greatest, number, of, any, element, their, mass, numbers, are, 112, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 122, and, 124, tin, 120, makes, up, almost, a, third, of, all, tin, tin, 118, and, tin, 116, are, also, common, tin, 115, is, the, least, common, stable, isotope, the, isotopes, with, even, mass, numbers, have, no, nuclear, spin, while, those, with, odd, mass, numbers, have, a, nuclear, spin, of, 1, 2, it, is, thought, that, tin, has, such, a, great, multitude, of, stable, isotopes, because, of, tin, s, atomic, number, being, 50, which, is, a, magic, number, in, nuclear, physics, tin, is, one, of, the, easiest, elements, to, detect, and, analyze, by, nmr, spectroscopy, which, relies, on, molecular, weight, and, its, chemical, shifts, are, referenced, against, tetramethyltin, snme, 4, of, the, stable, isotopes, tin, 115, has, a, high, neutron, capture, cross, section, for, fast, neutron, energies, at, 30, barns, tin, 117, has, a, cross, section, of, 2, 3, barns, one, order, of, magnitude, smaller, while, tin, 119, has, a, slightly, smaller, cross, section, of, 2, 2, barns, before, these, cross, sections, were, well, known, it, was, proposed, to, use, tin, lead, solder, as, a, reactor, coolant, for, fast, reactors, because, of, its, low, melting, point, current, studies, are, for, lead, or, lead, bismuth, reactor, coolants, because, both, heavy, metals, are, nearly, transparent, to, fast, neutrons, with, very, low, capture, cross, sections, in, order, to, use, a, tin, or, tin, lead, coolant, the, tin, would, first, have, to, go, through, isotopic, separation, to, remove, the, isotopes, with, odd, mass, number, combined, these, three, isotopes, make, up, about, 17, of, natural, tin, but, represent, nearly, all, of, the, capture, cross, section, of, the, remaining, seven, isotopes, tin, 112, has, a, capture, cross, section, of, 1, barn, the, other, six, isotopes, forming, 82, 7, of, natural, tin, have, capture, cross, sections, of, 0, 3, barns, or, less, making, them, effectively, transparent, to, neutrons, tin, has, 31, unstable, isotopes, ranging, in, mass, number, from, 99, to, 139, the, unstable, tin, isotopes, have, half, lives, of, less, than, a, year, except, for, tin, 126, which, has, a, half, life, of, about, 230, 000, years, tin, 100, and, tin, 132, are, two, of, the, very, few, nuclides, with, a, doubly, magic, nucleus, which, despite, being, unstable, as, they, have, very, uneven, neutron, proton, ratios, are, the, endpoints, beyond, which, tin, isotopes, lighter, than, tin, 100, and, heavier, than, tin, 132, are, much, less, stable, another, 30, metastable, isomers, have, been, identified, for, tin, isotopes, between, 111, and, 131, the, most, stable, being, tin, 121m, with, a, half, life, of, 43, 9, years, the, relative, differences, in, the, abundances, of, tin, s, stable, isotopes, can, be, explained, by, how, they, are, formed, during, stellar, nucleosynthesis, tin, 116, through, tin, 120, along, with, tin, 122, are, formed, in, the, s, process, slow, neutron, capture, in, most, stars, which, leads, to, them, being, the, most, common, tin, isotopes, while, tin, 124, is, only, formed, in, the, r, process, rapid, neutron, capture, in, supernovae, and, neutron, star, mergers, tin, isotopes, 115, 117, through, 120, and, 122, are, produced, via, both, the, s, process, and, the, r, process, the, two, lightest, stable, isotopes, tin, 112, and, tin, 114, cannot, be, made, in, significant, amounts, in, the, s, or, r, processes, and, are, among, the, p, nuclei, whose, origins, are, not, well, understood, some, theories, about, their, formation, include, proton, capture, and, photodisintegration, tin, 115, might, be, partially, produced, in, the, s, process, both, directly, and, as, the, daughter, of, long, lived, indium, 115, and, also, from, the, decay, of, indium, 115, produced, via, the, r, process, the, word, tin, is, shared, among, germanic, languages, and, can, be, traced, back, to, reconstructed, proto, germanic, tin, om, cognates, include, german, zinn, swedish, tenn, and, dutch, tin, it, is, not, found, in, other, branches, of, indo, european, except, by, borrowing, from, germanic, e, g, irish, tinne, from, english, the, latin, name, for, tin, stannum, originally, meant, an, alloy, of, silver, and, lead, and, came, to, mean, tin, in, the, fourth, century, the, earlier, latin, word, for, it, was, plumbum, candidum, or, white, lead, stannum, apparently, came, from, an, earlier, st, gnum, meaning, the, same, substance, the, origin, of, the, romance, and, celtic, terms, for, tin, such, as, french, tain, spanish, esta, o, italian, stagno, and, irish, st, n, the, origin, of, stannum, st, gnum, is, unknown, it, may, be, pre, indo, european, the, meyers, konversations, lexikon, suggests, instead, that, stannum, came, from, cornish, stean, and, is, evidence, that, cornwall, in, the, first, centuries, ad, was, the, main, source, of, tin, tin, extraction, and, use, can, be, dated, to, the, beginnings, of, the, bronze, age, around, 3000, bc, when, it, was, observed, that, copper, objects, formed, of, polymetallic, ores, with, different, metal, contents, had, different, physical, properties, the, earliest, bronze, objects, had, a, tin, or, arsenic, content, of, less, than, 2, and, are, believed, to, be, the, result, of, unintentional, alloying, due, to, trace, metal, content, in, the, copper, ore, the, addition, of, a, second, metal, to, copper, increases, its, hardness, lowers, the, melting, temperature, and, improves, the, casting, process, by, producing, a, more, fluid, melt, that, cools, to, a, denser, less, spongy, metal, this, was, an, important, innovation, that, allowed, for, the, much, more, complex, shapes, cast, in, closed, molds, of, the, bronze, age, arsenical, bronze, objects, appear, first, in, the, near, east, where, arsenic, is, commonly, found, with, copper, ore, but, the, health, risks, were, quickly, realized, and, the, quest, for, sources, of, the, much, less, hazardous, tin, ores, began, early, in, the, bronze, age, this, created, the, demand, for, rare, tin, metal, and, formed, a, trade, network, that, linked, the, distant, sources, of, tin, to, the, markets, of, bronze, age, cultures, cassiterite, sno, 2, the, oxide, form, of, tin, was, most, likely, the, original, source, of, tin, other, tin, ores, are, less, common, sulfides, such, as, stannite, that, require, a, more, involved, smelting, process, cassiterite, often, accumulates, in, alluvial, channels, as, placer, deposits, because, it, is, harder, heavier, and, more, chemically, resistant, than, the, accompanying, granite, cassiterite, is, usually, black, or, dark, in, color, and, these, deposits, can, be, easily, seen, in, river, banks, alluvial, placer, deposits, may, incidentally, have, been, collected, and, separated, by, methods, similar, to, gold, panning, in, the, great, majority, of, its, compounds, tin, has, the, oxidation, state, ii, or, iv, compounds, containing, bivalent, tin, are, called, stannous, while, those, containing, tetravalent, tin, are, termed, stannic, halide, compounds, are, known, for, both, oxidation, states, for, sn, iv, all, four, halides, are, well, known, snf, 4, sncl, 4, snbr, 4, and, sni, 4, the, three, heavier, members, are, volatile, molecular, compounds, whereas, the, tetrafluoride, is, polymeric, all, four, halides, are, known, for, sn, ii, also, snf, 2, sncl, 2, snbr, 2, and, sni, 2, all, are, polymeric, solids, of, these, eight, compounds, only, the, iodides, are, colored, tin, ii, chloride, also, known, as, stannous, chloride, is, the, most, important, commercial, tin, halide, illustrating, the, routes, to, such, compounds, chlorine, reacts, with, tin, metal, to, give, sncl, 4, whereas, the, reaction, of, hydrochloric, acid, and, tin, produces, sncl, 2, and, hydrogen, gas, alternatively, sncl, 4, and, sn, combine, to, stannous, chloride, by, a, process, called, comproportionation, tin, can, form, many, oxides, sulfides, and, other, chalcogenide, derivatives, the, dioxide, sno, 2, cassiterite, forms, when, tin, is, heated, in, the, presence, of, air, sno, 2, is, amphoteric, which, means, that, it, dissolves, in, both, acidic, and, basic, solutions, stannates, with, the, structure, 2, like, k, 2, are, also, known, though, the, free, stannic, acid, h, 2, is, unknown, sulfides, of, tin, exist, in, both, the, 2, and, 4, oxidation, states, tin, ii, sulfide, and, tin, iv, sulfide, mosaic, gold, stannane, snh, 4, with, tin, in, the, 4, oxidation, state, is, unstable, organotin, hydrides, are, however, well, known, e, g, tributyltin, hydride, sn, c, 4, h, 9, 3, h, these, compounds, release, transient, tributyl, tin, radicals, which, are, rare, examples, of, compounds, of, tin, iii, organotin, compounds, sometimes, called, stannanes, are, chemical, compounds, with, tin, carbon, bonds, of, the, tin, compounds, the, organic, derivatives, are, commercially, the, most, useful, some, organotin, compounds, are, highly, toxic, and, have, been, used, as, biocides, the, first, organotin, compound, to, be, reported, was, diethyltin, diiodide, c, 2, h, 5, 2, sni, 2, reported, by, edward, frankland, in, 1849, most, organotin, compounds, are, colorless, liquids, or, solids, that, are, stable, to, air, and, water, they, adopt, tetrahedral, geometry, tetraalkyl, and, tetraaryltin, compounds, can, be, prepared, using, grignard, reagents, the, mixed, halide, alkyls, which, are, more, common, and, more, important, commercially, than, the, tetraorgano, derivatives, are, prepared, by, redistribution, reactions, divalent, organotin, compounds, are, uncommon, although, more, common, than, related, divalent, organogermanium, and, organosilicon, compounds, the, greater, stabilization, enjoyed, by, sn, ii, is, attributed, to, the, inert, pair, effect, organotin, ii, compounds, include, both, stannylenes, formula, r, 2, sn, as, seen, for, singlet, carbenes, and, distannylenes, r, 4, sn, 2, which, are, roughly, equivalent, to, alkenes, both, classes, exhibit, unusual, reactions, tin, is, generated, via, the, long, s, process, in, low, to, medium, mass, stars, with, masses, of, 0, 6, to, 10, times, that, of, the, sun, and, finally, by, beta, decay, of, the, heavy, isotopes, of, indium, tin, is, the, 49th, most, abundant, element, in, earth, s, crust, representing, 2, ppm, compared, with, 75, ppm, for, zinc, 50, ppm, for, copper, and, 14, ppm, for, lead, tin, does, not, occur, as, the, native, element, but, must, be, extracted, from, various, ores, cassiterite, sno, 2, is, the, only, commercially, important, source, of, tin, although, small, quantities, of, tin, are, recovered, from, complex, sulfides, such, as, stannite, cylindrite, franckeite, canfieldite, and, teallite, minerals, with, tin, are, almost, always, associated, with, granite, rock, usually, at, a, level, of, 1, tin, oxide, content, because, of, the, higher, specific, gravity, of, tin, dioxide, about, 80, of, mined, tin, is, from, secondary, deposits, found, downstream, from, the, primary, lodes, tin, is, often, recovered, from, granules, washed, downstream, in, the, past, and, deposited, in, valleys, or, the, sea, the, most, economical, ways, of, mining, tin, are, by, dredging, hydraulicking, or, open, pits, most, of, the, world, s, tin, is, produced, from, placer, deposits, which, can, contain, as, little, as, 0, 015, tin, about, 253, 000, tonnes, of, tin, were, mined, in, 2011, mostly, in, china, 110, 000, t, indonesia, 51, 000, t, peru, 34, 600, t, bolivia, 20, 700, t, and, brazil, 12, 000, t, estimates, of, tin, production, have, historically, varied, with, the, market, and, mining, technology, it, is, estimated, that, at, current, consumption, rates, and, technologies, the, earth, will, run, out, of, mine, able, tin, in, 40, years, in, 2006, lester, brown, suggested, tin, could, run, out, within, 20, years, based, on, conservative, estimates, of, 2, annual, growth, scrap, tin, is, an, important, source, of, the, metal, recovery, of, tin, through, recycling, is, increasing, rapidly, as, of, 2019, whereas, the, united, states, has, neither, mined, since, 1993, nor, smelted, since, 1989, tin, it, was, the, largest, secondary, producer, recycling, nearly, 14, 000, tonnes, in, 2006, new, deposits, are, reported, in, mongolia, and, in, 2009, new, deposits, of, tin, were, discovered, in, colombia, tin, is, produced, by, carbothermic, reduction, of, the, oxide, ore, with, carbon, or, coke, both, reverberatory, furnace, and, electric, furnace, can, be, used, the, ten, largest, tin, producing, companies, produced, most, of, the, world, s, tin, in, 2007, most, of, the, world, s, tin, is, traded, on, lme, from, 8, countries, under, 17, brands, the, international, tin, council, was, established, in, 1947, to, control, the, price, of, tin, it, collapsed, in, 1985, in, 1984, the, association, of, tin, producing, countries, was, created, with, australia, bolivia, indonesia, malaysia, nigeria, thailand, and, zaire, as, members, tin, is, unique, among, mineral, commodities, because, of, the, complex, agreements, between, producer, countries, and, consumer, countries, dating, back, to, 1921, earlier, agreements, tended, to, be, somewhat, informal, and, led, to, the, first, international, tin, agreement, in, 1956, the, first, of, a, series, that, effectively, collapsed, in, 1985, through, these, agreements, the, international, tin, council, itc, had, a, considerable, effect, on, tin, prices, itc, supported, the, price, of, tin, during, periods, of, low, prices, by, buying, tin, for, its, buffer, stockpile, and, was, able, to, restrain, the, price, during, periods, of, high, prices, by, selling, from, the, stockpile, this, was, an, anti, free, market, approach, designed, to, assure, a, sufficient, flow, of, tin, to, consumer, countries, and, a, profit, for, producer, countries, however, the, buffer, stockpile, was, not, sufficiently, large, and, during, most, of, those, 29, years, tin, prices, rose, sometimes, sharply, especially, from, 1973, through, 1980, when, rampant, inflation, plagued, many, world, economies, during, the, late, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, the, u, s, reduced, its, strategic, tin, stockpile, partly, to, take, advantage, of, historically, high, tin, prices, the, 1981, 82, recession, damaged, the, tin, industry, tin, consumption, declined, dramatically, itc, was, able, to, avoid, truly, steep, declines, through, accelerated, buying, for, its, buffer, stockpile, this, activity, required, extensive, borrowing, itc, continued, to, borrow, until, late, 1985, when, it, reached, its, credit, limit, immediately, a, major, tin, crisis, ensued, tin, was, delisted, from, trading, on, the, london, metal, exchange, for, about, three, years, itc, dissolved, soon, afterward, and, the, price, of, tin, now, in, a, free, market, environment, fell, to, 4, per, pound, and, remained, around, that, level, through, the, 1990s, the, price, increased, again, by, 2010, with, a, rebound, in, consumption, following, the, 2007, 2008, economic, crisis, accompanying, restocking, and, continued, growth, in, consumption, london, metal, exchange, lme, is, tin, s, principal, trading, site, other, tin, contract, markets, are, kuala, lumpur, tin, market, kltm, and, indonesia, tin, exchange, inatin, due, to, factors, involved, in, the, 2021, global, supply, chain, crisis, tin, prices, almost, doubled, during, 2020, 21, and, have, had, their, largest, annual, rise, in, over, 30, years, global, refined, tin, consumption, dropped, 1, 6, percent, in, 2020, as, the, covid, 19, pandemic, disrupted, global, manufacturing, industries, in, 2018, just, under, half, of, all, tin, produced, was, used, in, solder, the, rest, was, divided, between, tin, plating, tin, chemicals, brass, and, bronze, alloys, and, niche, uses, pigment, yellow, 38, tin, iv, sulfide, is, known, as, mosaic, gold, purple, of, cassius, pigment, red, 109, a, hydrous, double, stannate, of, gold, was, mainly, in, terms, of, painting, restricted, to, miniatures, due, to, its, high, cost, it, was, widely, used, to, make, cranberry, glass, it, has, also, been, used, in, the, arts, to, stain, porcelain, lead, tin, yellow, which, occurs, in, two, yellow, forms, a, stannate, and, a, silicate, was, a, pigment, that, was, historically, highly, important, for, oil, painting, and, which, had, some, use, in, fresco, in, its, silicate, form, lead, stannate, is, also, known, in, orange, form, but, has, not, seen, wide, use, in, the, fine, arts, it, is, available, for, purchase, in, pigment, form, from, specialist, artists, suppliers, there, is, another, minor, form, in, terms, of, artistic, usage, and, availability, of, lead, tin, yellow, known, as, lead, tin, antimony, yellow, cerulean, blue, a, somewhat, dull, cyan, chemically, known, as, cobalt, stannate, continues, to, be, an, important, artists, pigment, its, hue, is, similar, to, that, of, manganese, blue, pigment, blue, 33, although, it, lacks, that, pigment, s, colorfulness, and, is, more, opaque, artists, typically, must, choose, between, cobalt, stannate, and, manganese, blue, imitations, made, with, phthalocyanine, blue, green, shade, pigment, blue, 15, 3, as, industrial, production, of, manganese, blue, pigment, ceased, in, the, 1970s, cerulean, blue, made, with, cobalt, stannate, however, was, popular, with, artists, prior, to, the, production, of, manganese, blue, pigment, red, 233, commonly, known, as, pinkcolor, or, potter, s, pink, and, more, precisely, known, as, chrome, tin, pink, sphene, is, a, historically, important, pigment, in, watercolor, however, it, has, enjoyed, a, large, resurgence, in, popularity, due, to, internet, based, word, of, mouth, it, is, fully, lightfast, and, chemically, stable, in, both, oil, paints, and, watercolors, other, inorganic, mixed, metal, complex, pigments, produced, via, calcination, often, feature, tin, as, a, constituent, these, pigments, are, known, for, their, lightfastness, weatherfastness, chemical, stability, lack, of, toxicity, and, opacity, many, are, rather, dull, in, terms, of, colorfulness, however, some, possess, enough, colorfulness, to, be, competitive, for, use, cases, that, require, more, than, a, moderate, amount, of, it, some, are, prized, for, other, qualities, for, instance, pinkcolor, is, chosen, by, many, watercolorists, for, its, strong, granulation, even, though, its, chroma, is, low, recently, ntp, yellow, a, pyrochlore, has, been, brought, to, market, as, a, non, toxic, replacement, for, lead, ii, chromate, with, greater, opacity, lightfastness, and, weathering, resistance, than, proposed, organic, lead, chromate, replacement, pigments, possess, ntp, yellow, possesses, the, highest, level, of, color, saturation, of, these, contemporary, inorganic, mixed, metal, complex,

been, used, by, artists, that, have, tin, as, a, constituent, and, purplish, pigments, with, tin, are, classified, as, red, according, to, the, colour, index, international, tin, has, long, been, used, in, alloys, with, lead, as, solder, in, amounts, of, 5, to, 70, w, w, tin, with, lead, forms, a, eutectic, mixture, at, the, weight, proportion, of, 61, 9, tin, and, 38, 1, lead, the, atomic, proportion, 73, 9, tin, and, 26, 1, lead, with, melting, temperature, of, 183, c, 361, 4, f, such, solders, are, primarily, used, for, joining, pipes, or, electric, circuits, since, the, european, union, waste, electrical, and, electronic, equipment, directive, weee, directive, and, restriction, of, hazardous, substances, directive, came, into, effect, on, 1, july, 2006, the, lead, content, in, such, alloys, has, decreased, while, lead, exposure, is, associated, with, serious, health, problems, lead, free, solder, is, not, without, its, challenges, including, a, higher, melting, point, and, the, formation, of, tin, whiskers, that, cause, electrical, problems, tin, pest, can, occur, in, lead, free, solders, leading, to, loss, of, the, soldered, joint, replacement, alloys, are, being, found, but, the, problems, of, joint, integrity, remain, a, common, lead, free, alloy, is, 99, tin, 0, 7, copper, and, 0, 3, silver, with, melting, temperature, of, 217, c, 422, 6, f, tin, bonds, readily, to, iron, and, is, used, for, coating, lead, zinc, and, steel, to, prevent, corrosion, tin, plated, or, tinned, steel, containers, are, widely, used, for, food, preservation, and, this, forms, a, large, part, of, the, market, for, metallic, tin, a, tinplate, canister, for, preserving, food, was, first, manufactured, in, london, in, 1812, speakers, of, british, english, call, such, containers, tins, while, speakers, of, u, s, english, call, them, cans, or, tin, cans, one, derivation, of, such, use, is, the, slang, term, tinnie, or, tinny, meaning, can, of, beer, in, australia, the, tin, whistle, is, so, called, because, it, was, mass, produced, first, in, tin, plated, steel, copper, cooking, vessels, such, as, saucepans, and, frying, pans, are, frequently, lined, with, a, thin, plating, of, tin, by, electroplating, or, by, traditional, chemical, methods, since, use, of, copper, cookware, with, acidic, foods, can, be, toxic, tin, in, combination, with, other, elements, forms, a, wide, variety, of, useful, alloys, tin, is, most, commonly, alloyed, with, copper, pewter, is, 85, 99, tin, and, bearing, metal, has, a, high, percentage, of, tin, as, well, bronze, is, mostly, copper, with, 12, tin, while, the, addition, of, phosphorus, yields, phosphor, bronze, bell, metal, is, also, a, copper, tin, alloy, containing, 22, tin, tin, has, sometimes, been, used, in, coinage, it, once, formed, a, single, digit, percentage, usually, five, percent, or, less, of, american, pennies, and, canadian, the, niobium, tin, compound, nb, 3, sn, is, commercially, used, in, coils, of, superconducting, magnets, for, its, high, critical, temperature, 18, k, and, critical, magnetic, field, 25, t, a, superconducting, magnet, weighing, as, little, as, two, kilograms, is, capable, of, producing, the, magnetic, field, of, a, conventional, electromagnet, weighing, tons, a, small, percentage, of, tin, is, added, to, zirconium, alloys, for, the, cladding, of, nuclear, fuel, most, metal, pipes, in, a, pipe, organ, are, of, a, tin, lead, alloy, with, 50, 50, as, the, most, common, composition, the, proportion, of, tin, in, the, pipe, defines, the, pipe, s, tone, since, tin, has, a, desirable, tonal, resonance, when, a, tin, lead, alloy, cools, the, lead, phase, solidifies, first, then, when, the, eutectic, temperature, is, reached, the, remaining, liquid, forms, the, layered, tin, lead, eutectic, structure, which, is, shiny, contrast, with, the, lead, phase, produces, a, mottled, or, spotted, effect, this, metal, alloy, is, referred, to, as, spotted, metal, major, advantages, of, using, tin, for, pipes, include, its, appearance, workability, and, resistance, to, corrosion, tin, compounds, are, used, in, the, production, of, various, chemicals, including, stabilizers, for, pvc, and, catalysts, for, industrial, processes, tin, in, form, of, ingots, provide, the, raw, material, necessary, for, these, chemical, reactions, ensuring, consistent, quality, and, performance, the, oxides, of, indium, and, tin, are, electrically, conductive, and, transparent, and, are, used, to, make, transparent, electrically, conducting, films, with, applications, in, optoelectronics, devices, such, as, liquid, crystal, displays, punched, tin, plated, steel, also, called, pierced, tin, is, an, artisan, technique, originating, in, central, europe, for, creating, functional, and, decorative, housewares, decorative, piercing, designs, exist, in, a, wide, variety, based, on, local, tradition, and, the, artisan, punched, tin, lanterns, are, the, most, common, application, of, this, artisan, technique, the, light, of, a, candle, shining, through, the, pierced, design, creates, a, decorative, light, pattern, in, the, room, where, it, sits, lanterns, and, other, punched, tin, articles, were, created, in, the, new, world, from, the, earliest, european, settlement, a, well, known, example, is, the, revere, lantern, named, after, paul, revere, in, america, pie, safes, and, food, safes, were, in, use, in, the, days, before, refrigeration, these, were, wooden, cupboards, of, various, styles, and, sizes, either, floor, standing, or, hanging, cupboards, meant, to, discourage, vermin, and, insects, and, to, keep, dust, from, perishable, foodstuffs, these, cabinets, had, tinplate, inserts, in, the, doors, and, sometimes, in, the, sides, punched, out, by, the, homeowner, cabinetmaker, or, a, tinsmith, in, varying, designs, to, allow, for, air, circulation, while, excluding, flies, modern, reproductions, of, these, articles, remain, popular, in, north, america, window, glass, is, most, often, made, by, floating, molten, glass, on, molten, tin, float, glass, resulting, in, a, flat, and, flawless, surface, this, is, also, called, the, pilkington, process, tin, is, used, as, a, negative, electrode, in, advanced, li, ion, batteries, its, application, is, somewhat, limited, by, the, fact, that, some, tin, surfaces, catalyze, decomposition, of, carbonate, based, electrolytes, used, in, li, ion, batteries, tin, ii, fluoride, is, added, to, some, dental, care, products, as, stannous, fluoride, snf, 2, tin, ii, fluoride, can, be, mixed, with, calcium, abrasives, while, the, more, common, sodium, fluoride, gradually, becomes, biologically, inactive, in, the, presence, of, calcium, compounds, it, has, also, been, shown, to, be, more, effective, than, sodium, fluoride, in, controlling, gingivitis, tin, is, used, as, a, target, to, create, laser, induced, plasmas, that, act, as, the, light, source, for, extreme, ultraviolet, lithography, organotin, compounds, are, organometallic, compounds, containing, tin, 1, carbon, bonds, worldwide, industrial, production, of, organotin, compounds, likely, exceeds, 50, 000, tonnes, the, major, commercial, application, of, organotin, compounds, is, in, the, stabilization, of, pvc, plastics, in, the, absence, of, such, stabilizers, pvc, would, rapidly, degrade, under, heat, light, and, atmospheric, oxygen, resulting, in, discolored, brittle, products, tin, scavenges, labile, chloride, ions, cl, which, would, otherwise, strip, hcl, from, the, plastic, material, typical, tin, compounds, are, carboxylic, acid, derivatives, of, dibutyltin, dichloride, such, as, dibutyltin, dilaurate, some, organotin, compounds, are, relatively, toxic, with, both, advantages, and, problems, they, are, used, for, biocidal, properties, as, fungicides, pesticides, algaecides, wood, preservatives, and, antifouling, agents, tributyltin, oxide, is, used, as, a, wood, preservative, tributyltin, is, used, for, various, industrial, purposes, such, as, slime, control, in, paper, mills, and, disinfection, of, circulating, industrial, cooling, waters, tributyltin, was, used, as, additive, for, ship, paint, to, prevent, growth, of, fouling, organisms, on, ships, with, use, declining, after, organotin, compounds, were, recognized, as, persistent, organic, pollutants, with, high, toxicity, for, some, marine, organisms, the, dog, whelk, for, example, the, eu, banned, the, use, of, organotin, compounds, in, 2003, while, concerns, over, the, toxicity, of, these, compounds, to, marine, life, and, damage, to, the, reproduction, and, growth, of, some, marine, species, some, reports, describe, biological, effects, to, marine, life, at, a, concentration, of, 1, nanogram, per, liter, have, led, to, a, worldwide, ban, by, the, international, maritime, organization, many, nations, now, restrict, the, use, of, organotin, compounds, to, vessels, greater, than, 25, m, 82, ft, long, the, persistence, of, tributyltin, in, the, aquatic, environment, is, dependent, upon, the, nature, of, the, ecosystem, because, of, this, persistence, and, its, use, as, an, additive, in, ship, paint, high, concentrations, of, tributyltin, have, been, found, in, marine, sediments, located, near, naval, docks, tributyltin, has, been, used, as, a, biomarker, for, imposex, in, neogastropods, with, at, least, 82, known, species, with, the, high, levels, of, tbt, in, the, local, inshore, areas, due, to, shipping, activities, the, shellfish, had, an, adverse, effect, imposex, is, the, imposition, of, male, sexual, characteristics, on, female, specimens, where, they, grow, a, penis, and, a, pallial, vas, deferens, a, high, level, of, tbt, can, damage, mammalian, endocrine, glands, reproductive, and, central, nervous, systems, bone, structure, and, gastrointestinal, tract, not, only, does, tributyltin, affect, mammals, it, affects, sea, otters, whales, dolphins, and, humans, some, tin, reagents, are, useful, in, organic, chemistry, in, the, largest, application, stannous, chloride, is, a, common, reducing, agent, for, the, conversion, of, nitro, and, oxime, groups, to, amines, the, stille, reaction, couples, organotin, compounds, with, organic, halides, or, pseudohalides, tin, forms, several, inter, metallic, phases, with, lithium, metal, making, it, a, potentially, attractive, material, for, battery, applications, large, volumetric, expansion, of, tin, upon, alloying, with, lithium, and, instability, of, the, tin, organic, electrolyte, interface, at, low, electrochemical, potentials, are, the, greatest, challenges, to, employment, in, commercial, cells, tin, inter, metallic, compound, with, cobalt, and, carbon, was, implemented, by, sony, in, its, nexelion, cells, released, in, the, late, 2000s, the, composition, of, the, active, material, is, approximately, sn, 0, 3, co, 0, 4, c, 0, 3, research, showed, that, only, some, crystalline, facets, of, tetragonal, beta, sn, are, responsible, for, undesirable, electrochemical, activity, cases, of, poisoning, from, tin, metal, its, oxides, and, its, salts, are, almost, unknown, on, the, other, hand, certain, organotin, compounds, are, almost, as, toxic, as, cyanide, exposure, to, tin, in, the, workplace, can, occur, by, inhalation, skin, contact, and, eye, contact, the, us, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, set, the, permissible, exposure, limit, for, tin, exposure, in, the, workplace, as, 2, mg, m, 3, over, an, 8, hour, workday,
