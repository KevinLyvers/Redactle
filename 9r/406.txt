promethium, is, a, chemical, element, with, symbol, pm, and, atomic, number, 61, all, of, its, isotopes, are, radioactive, it, is, extremely, rare, with, only, about, 500, 600, grams, naturally, occurring, in, the, earth, s, crust, at, any, given, time, promethium, is, one, of, the, only, two, radioactive, elements, that, are, followed, in, the, periodic, table, by, elements, with, stable, forms, the, other, being, technetium, chemically, promethium, is, a, lanthanide, promethium, shows, only, one, stable, oxidation, state, of, 3, in, 1902, bohuslav, brauner, suggested, that, there, was, a, then, unknown, element, with, properties, intermediate, between, those, of, the, known, elements, neodymium, 60, and, samarium, 62, this, was, confirmed, in, 1914, by, henry, moseley, who, having, measured, the, atomic, numbers, of, all, the, elements, then, known, found, that, the, element, with, atomic, number, 61, was, missing, in, 1926, two, groups, one, italian, and, one, american, claimed, to, have, isolated, a, sample, of, element, 61, both, discoveries, were, soon, proven, to, be, false, in, 1938, during, a, nuclear, experiment, conducted, at, ohio, state, university, a, few, radioactive, nuclides, were, produced, that, certainly, were, not, radioisotopes, of, neodymium, or, samarium, but, there, was, a, lack, of, chemical, proof, that, element, 61, was, produced, and, the, discovery, was, not, much, recognized, promethium, was, first, produced, and, characterized, at, oak, ridge, national, laboratory, in, 1945, by, the, separation, and, analysis, of, the, fission, products, of, uranium, fuel, irradiated, in, a, graphite, reactor, the, discoverers, proposed, the, name, prometheum, the, spelling, was, subsequently, changed, derived, from, prometheus, the, titan, in, greek, mythology, who, stole, fire, from, mount, olympus, and, brought, it, down, to, humans, to, symbolize, both, the, daring, and, the, possible, misuse, of, mankind, s, intellect, however, a, sample, of, the, metal, was, made, only, in, 1963, the, two, sources, of, natural, promethium, are, rare, alpha, decays, of, natural, europium, 151, producing, promethium, 147, and, spontaneous, fission, of, uranium, various, isotopes, promethium, 145, is, the, most, stable, promethium, isotope, but, the, only, isotope, with, practical, applications, is, promethium, 147, chemical, compounds, of, which, are, used, in, luminous, paint, atomic, batteries, and, thickness, measurement, devices, because, natural, promethium, is, exceedingly, scarce, it, is, typically, synthesized, by, bombarding, uranium, 235, enriched, uranium, with, thermal, neutrons, to, produce, promethium, 147, as, a, fission, product, a, promethium, atom, has, 61, electrons, arranged, in, the, configuration, 4f, 5, 6s, 2, the, seven, 4f, and, 6s, electrons, are, valence, electrons, in, forming, compounds, the, atom, loses, its, two, outermost, electrons, and, one, 4f, electron, which, belongs, to, an, open, subshell, the, element, s, atomic, radius, is, the, second, largest, among, all, the, lanthanides, but, is, only, slightly, greater, than, those, of, the, neighboring, elements, it, is, the, most, notable, exception, to, the, general, trend, of, the, contraction, of, lanthanide, atoms, with, the, increase, of, their, atomic, numbers, lanthanide, contraction, many, properties, of, promethium, rely, on, its, position, among, lanthanides, and, are, intermediate, between, those, of, neodymium, and, samarium, for, example, the, melting, point, the, first, three, ionization, energies, and, the, hydration, energy, are, greater, than, those, of, neodymium, and, lower, than, those, of, samarium, similarly, the, estimate, for, the, boiling, point, ionic, pm, 3, radius, and, standard, heat, of, formation, of, monatomic, gas, are, greater, than, those, of, samarium, and, less, than, those, of, neodymium, promethium, has, a, double, hexagonal, close, packed, dhcp, structure, and, a, hardness, of, 63, kg, mm, 2, this, low, temperature, alpha, form, converts, into, a, beta, body, centered, cubic, bcc, phase, upon, heating, to, 890, c, promethium, belongs, to, the, cerium, group, of, lanthanides, and, is, chemically, very, similar, to, the, neighboring, elements, because, of, its, instability, chemical, studies, of, promethium, are, incomplete, even, though, a, few, compounds, have, been, synthesized, they, are, not, fully, studied, in, general, they, tend, to, be, pink, or, red, in, color, in, may, 2024, a, promethium, coordination, complex, with, neutral, pydga, ligands, was, characterized, in, aqueous, solution, treatment, of, acidic, solutions, containing, pm, 3, ions, with, ammonia, results, in, a, gelatinous, light, brown, sediment, of, hydroxide, pm, oh, 3, which, is, insoluble, in, water, when, dissolved, in, hydrochloric, acid, a, water, soluble, yellow, salt, pmcl, 3, is, produced, similarly, when, dissolved, in, nitric, acid, a, nitrate, results, pm, no, 3, 3, the, latter, is, also, well, soluble, when, dried, it, forms, pink, crystals, similar, to, nd, no, 3, 3, the, electron, configuration, for, pm, 3, is, 4f, 4, and, the, color, of, the, ion, is, pink, the, ground, state, term, symbol, is, 5, i, 4, the, sulfate, is, slightly, soluble, like, the, other, cerium, group, sulfates, cell, parameters, have, been, calculated, for, its, octahydrate, they, lead, to, conclusion, that, the, density, of, pm, 2, so, 4, 3, 8h, 2, o, is, 2, 86, g, cm, 3, the, oxalate, pm, 2, c, 2, o, 4, 3, 10h, 2, o, has, the, lowest, solubility, of, all, lanthanide, oxalates, unlike, the, nitrate, the, oxide, is, similar, to, the, corresponding, samarium, salt, and, not, the, neodymium, salt, as, synthesized, e, g, by, heating, the, oxalate, it, is, a, white, or, lavender, colored, powder, with, disordered, structure, this, powder, crystallizes, in, a, cubic, lattice, upon, heating, to, 600, c, further, annealing, at, 800, c, and, then, at, 1750, c, irreversibly, transforms, it, to, monoclinic, and, hexagonal, phases, respectively, and, the, last, two, phases, can, be, interconverted, by, adjusting, the, annealing, time, and, temperature, promethium, forms, only, one, stable, oxidation, state, 3, in, the, form, of, ions, this, is, in, line, with, other, lanthanides, promethium, can, also, form, the, 2, oxidation, state, thermodynamic, properties, of, pm, 2, suggests, that, the, dihalides, are, stable, similar, to, ndcl, 2, and, smcl, 2, promethium, is, the, only, lanthanide, and, one, of, only, two, elements, among, the, first, 82, with, no, stable, or, long, lived, primordial, isotopes, this, is, a, result, of, a, rarely, occurring, effect, of, the, liquid, drop, model, and, stabilities, of, neighbor, element, isotopes, it, is, also, the, least, stable, element, of, the, first, 84, the, primary, decay, products, are, neodymium, and, samarium, isotopes, promethium, 146, decays, to, both, the, lighter, isotopes, generally, to, neodymium, via, positron, decay, and, electron, capture, and, the, heavier, isotopes, to, samarium, via, beta, decay, promethium, nuclear, isomers, may, decay, to, other, promethium, isotopes, and, one, isotope, 145, pm, has, a, very, rare, alpha, decay, mode, to, stable, praseodymium, 141, the, most, stable, isotope, of, the, element, is, promethium, 145, which, has, a, specific, activity, of, 139, ci, g, 5, 1, tbq, g, and, a, half, life, of, 17, 7, years, via, electron, capture, because, it, has, 84, neutrons, two, more, than, 82, which, is, a, magic, number, which, corresponds, to, a, stable, neutron, configuration, it, may, emit, an, alpha, particle, which, has, 2, neutrons, to, form, praseodymium, 141, with, 82, neutrons, thus, it, is, the, only, promethium, isotope, with, an, experimentally, observed, alpha, decay, its, partial, half, life, for, alpha, decay, is, about, 6, 3, 10, 9, years, and, the, relative, probability, for, a, 145, pm, nucleus, to, decay, in, this, way, is, 2, 8, 10, 7, several, other, promethium, isotopes, such, as, 144, pm, 146, pm, and, 147, pm, also, have, a, positive, energy, release, for, alpha, decay, their, alpha, decays, are, predicted, to, occur, but, have, not, been, observed, in, total, 41, isotopes, of, promethium, are, known, ranging, from, 126, pm, to, 166, pm, the, element, also, has, 18, nuclear, isomers, with, mass, numbers, of, 133, to, 142, 144, 148, 149, 152, and, 154, some, mass, numbers, have, more, than, one, isomer, the, most, stable, of, them, is, promethium, 148m, with, a, half, life, of, 43, 1, days, this, is, longer, than, the, half, lives, of, the, ground, states, of, all, promethium, isotopes, except, for, promethium, 143, to, 147, in, fact, promethium, 148m, has, a, longer, half, life, than, its, ground, state, promethium, 148, in, 1934, willard, libby, reported, that, he, had, found, weak, beta, activity, in, pure, neodymium, which, was, attributed, to, a, half, life, over, 10, 12, years, almost, 20, years, later, it, was, claimed, that, the, element, occurs, in, natural, neodymium, in, equilibrium, in, quantities, below, 10, 20, grams, of, promethium, per, one, gram, of, neodymium, however, these, observations, were, disproved, by, newer, investigations, because, for, all, seven, naturally, occurring, neodymium, isotopes, any, single, beta, decays, which, can, produce, promethium, isotopes, are, forbidden, by, energy, conservation, in, particular, careful, measurements, of, atomic, masses, show, that, the, mass, difference, between, 150, nd, and, 150, pm, is, negative, 87, kev, which, absolutely, prevents, the, single, beta, decay, of, 150, nd, to, 150, pm, in, 1965, olavi, er, mets, separated, out, traces, of, 147, pm, from, a, rare, earth, concentrate, purified, from, apatite, resulting, in, an, upper, limit, of, 10, 21, for, the, abundance, of, promethium, in, nature, this, may, have, been, produced, by, the, natural, nuclear, fission, of, uranium, or, by, cosmic, ray, spallation, of, 146, nd, both, isotopes, of, natural, europium, have, larger, mass, excesses, than, sums, of, those, of, their, potential, alpha, daughters, plus, that, of, an, alpha, particle, therefore, they, stable, in, practice, may, alpha, decay, to, promethium, research, at, laboratori, nazionali, del, gran, sasso, showed, that, europium, 151, decays, to, promethium, 147, with, the, half, life, of, 5, 10, 18, years, it, has, been, shown, that, europium, is, responsible, for, about, 12, grams, of, promethium, in, the, earth, s, crust, alpha, decays, for, europium, 153, have, not, been, found, yet, and, its, theoretically, calculated, half, life, is, so, high, due, to, low, energy, of, decay, that, this, process, will, probably, not, be, observed, in, the, near, future, promethium, can, also, be, formed, in, nature, as, a, product, of, spontaneous, fission, of, uranium, 238, only, trace, amounts, can, be, found, in, naturally, occurring, ores, a, sample, of, pitchblende, has, been, found, to, contain, promethium, at, a, concentration, of, four, parts, per, quintillion, 4, 10, 18, by, mass, uranium, is, thus, responsible, for, 560, g, of, promethium, in, earth, s, crust, promethium, has, also, been, identified, in, the, spectrum, of, the, star, hr, 465, in, andromeda, it, also, has, been, found, in, hd, 101065, przybylski, s, star, and, hd, 965, because, of, the, short, half, life, of, promethium, isotopes, they, should, be, formed, near, the, surface, of, those, stars, in, 1902, czech, chemist, bohuslav, brauner, found, out, that, the, differences, in, properties, between, neodymium, and, samarium, were, the, largest, between, any, two, consecutive, lanthanides, in, the, sequence, then, known, as, a, conclusion, he, suggested, there, was, an, element, with, intermediate, properties, between, them, this, prediction, was, supported, in, 1914, by, henry, moseley, who, having, discovered, that, atomic, number, was, an, experimentally, measurable, property, of, elements, found, that, a, few, atomic, numbers, had, no, known, corresponding, elements, the, gaps, were, 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and, 87, with, the, knowledge, of, a, gap, in, the, periodic, table, several, groups, started, to, search, for, the, predicted, element, among, other, rare, earths, in, the, natural, environment, the, first, claim, of, a, discovery, was, published, by, luigi, rolla, and, lorenzo, fernandes, of, florence, italy, after, separating, a, mixture, of, a, few, rare, earth, elements, nitrate, concentrate, from, the, brazilian, mineral, monazite, by, fractionated, crystallization, they, yielded, a, solution, containing, mostly, samarium, this, solution, gave, x, ray, spectra, attributed, to, samarium, and, element, 61, in, honor, of, their, city, they, named, element, 61, florentium, the, results, were, published, in, 1926, but, the, scientists, claimed, that, the, experiments, were, done, in, 1924, also, in, 1926, a, group, of, scientists, from, the, university, of, illinois, at, urbana, champaign, smith, hopkins, and, len, yntema, published, the, discovery, of, element, 61, they, named, it, illinium, after, the, university, both, of, these, reported, discoveries, were, shown, to, be, erroneous, because, the, spectrum, line, that, corresponded, to, element, 61, was, identical, to, that, of, didymium, the, lines, thought, to, belong, to, element, 61, turned, out, to, belong, to, a, few, impurities, barium, chromium, and, platinum, in, 1934, josef, mattauch, finally, formulated, the, isobar, rule, one, of, the, indirect, consequences, of, this, rule, was, that, element, 61, was, unable, to, form, stable, isotopes, from, 1938, a, nuclear, experiment, was, conducted, by, h, b, law, et, al, at, the, ohio, state, university, nuclides, were, produced, in, 1941, which, were, not, radioisotopes, of, neodymium, or, samarium, and, the, name, cyclonium, was, proposed, but, there, was, a, lack, of, chemical, proof, that, element, 61, was, produced, and, the, discovery, was, not, largely, recognized, promethium, was, first, produced, and, characterized, at, oak, ridge, national, laboratory, clinton, laboratories, at, that, time, in, 1945, by, jacob, a, marinsky, lawrence, e, glendenin, and, charles, d, coryell, by, separation, and, analysis, of, the, fission, products, of, uranium, fuel, irradiated, in, the, graphite, reactor, however, being, too, busy, with, military, related, research, during, world, war, ii, they, did, not, announce, their, discovery, until, 1947, the, original, proposed, name, was, clintonium, after, the, laboratory, where, the, work, was, conducted, however, the, name, prometheum, was, suggested, by, grace, mary, coryell, the, wife, of, one, of, the, discoverers, it, is, derived, from, prometheus, the, titan, in, greek, mythology, who, stole, fire, from, mount, olympus, and, brought, it, down, to, humans, and, symbolizes, both, the, daring, and, the, possible, misuse, of, the, mankind, intellect, the, spelling, was, then, changed, to, promethium, as, this, was, in, accordance, with, most, other, metals, in, 1963, promethium, iii, fluoride, was, used, to, make, promethium, metal, provisionally, purified, from, impurities, of, samarium, neodymium, and, americium, it, was, put, into, a, tantalum, crucible, which, was, located, in, another, tantalum, crucible, the, outer, crucible, contained, lithium, metal, 10, times, excess, compared, to, promethium, after, creating, a, vacuum, the, chemicals, were, mixed, to, produce, promethium, metal, the, promethium, sample, produced, was, used, to, measure, a, few, of, the, metal, s, properties, such, as, its, melting, point, in, 1963, ion, exchange, methods, were, used, at, ornl, to, prepare, about, ten, grams, of, promethium, from, nuclear, reactor, fuel, processing, wastes, promethium, can, be, either, recovered, from, the, byproducts, of, uranium, fission, or, produced, by, bombarding, 146, nd, with, neutrons, turning, it, into, 147, nd, which, decays, into, 147, pm, through, beta, decay, with, a, half, life, of, 11, days, the, production, methods, for, different, isotopes, vary, and, only, those, for, promethium, 147, are, given, because, it, is, the, only, isotope, with, industrial, applications, promethium, 147, is, produced, in, large, quantities, compared, to, other, isotopes, by, bombarding, uranium, 235, with, thermal, neutrons, the, output, is, relatively, high, at, 2, 6, of, the, total, product, another, way, to, produce, promethium, 147, is, via, neodymium, 147, which, decays, to, promethium, 147, with, a, short, half, life, neodymium, 147, can, be, obtained, either, by, bombarding, enriched, neodymium, 146, with, thermal, neutrons, or, by, bombarding, a, uranium, carbide, target, with, energetic, protons, in, a, particle, accelerator, another, method, is, to, bombard, uranium, 238, with, fast, neutrons, to, cause, fast, fission, which, among, multiple, reaction, products, creates, promethium, 147, as, early, as, the, 1960s, oak, ridge, national, laboratory, could, produce, 650, grams, of, promethium, per, year, and, was, the, world, s, only, large, volume, synthesis, facility, gram, scale, production, of, promethium, has, been, discontinued, in, the, u, s, in, the, early, 1980s, but, will, possibly, be, resumed, after, 2010, at, the, high, flux, isotope, reactor, in, 2010, russia, was, the, only, country, producing, promethium, 147, on, a, relatively, large, scale, only, promethium, 147, has, uses, outside, laboratories, it, is, obtained, as, the, oxide, or, chloride, in, milligram, quantities, this, isotope, has, a, relatively, long, half, life, does, not, emit, gamma, rays, and, its, radiation, has, a, relatively, small, penetration, depth, in, matter, some, signal, lights, use, a, luminous, paint, containing, a, phosphor, that, absorbs, the, beta, radiation, emitted, by, promethium, 147, and, emits, light, this, isotope, does, not, cause, aging, of, the, phosphor, as, alpha, emitters, do, and, therefore, the, light, emission, is, stable, for, a, few, years, originally, radium, 226, was, used, for, the, purpose, but, it, was, later, replaced, by, promethium, 147, and, tritium, hydrogen, 3, promethium, may, be, favored, over, tritium, for, nuclear, safety, in, atomic, batteries, the, beta, particles, emitted, by, promethium, 147, are, converted, into, electric, current, by, sandwiching, a, small, promethium, source, between, two, semiconductor, plates, these, batteries, have, a, useful, lifetime, of, about, five, years, the, first, promethium, based, battery, was, assembled, in, 1964, and, generated, a, few, milliwatts, of, power, from, a, volume, of, about, 2, cubic, inches, including, shielding, promethium, is, also, used, to, measure, the, thickness, of, materials, by, measuring, the, amount, of, radiation, from, a, promethium, source, that, passes, through, the, sample, it, has, possible, future, uses, in, portable, x, ray, sources, and, as, auxiliary, heat, or, power, sources, for, space, probes, and, satellites, although, the, alpha, emitter, plutonium, 238, has, become, standard, for, most, space, exploration, related, uses, promethium, 147, is, also, used, albeit, in, very, small, quantities, less, than, 330nci, in, some, philips, cfl, compact, fluorescent, lamp, glow, switches, in, the, plc, 22w, 28w, 15mm, cfl, range, the, element, has, no, biological, role, promethium, 147, can, emit, gamma, rays, which, are, dangerous, for, all, lifeforms, during, its, beta, decay, interactions, with, tiny, quantities, of, promethium, 147, are, not, hazardous, if, certain, precautions, are, observed, in, general, gloves, footwear, covers, safety, glasses, and, an, outer, layer, of, easily, removed, protective, clothing, should, be, used, it, is, not, known, what, human, organs, are, affected, by, interaction, with, promethium, a, possible, candidate, is, the, bone, tissues, sealed, promethium, 147, is, not, dangerous, however, if, the, packaging, is, damaged, then, promethium, becomes, dangerous, to, the, environment, and, humans, if, radioactive, contamination, is, found, the, contaminated, area, should, be, washed, with, water, and, soap, but, even, though, promethium, mainly, affects, the, skin, the, skin, should, not, be, abraded, if, a, promethium, leak, is, found, the, area, should, be, identified, as, hazardous, and, evacuated, and, emergency, services, must, be, contacted, no, dangers, from, promethium, aside, from, the, radioactivity, are, known
