sea, ice, arises, as, seawater, freezes, because, ice, is, less, dense, than, water, it, floats, on, the, ocean, s, surface, as, does, fresh, water, ice, sea, ice, covers, about, 7, of, the, earth, s, surface, and, about, 12, of, the, world, s, oceans, much, of, the, world, s, sea, ice, is, enclosed, within, the, polar, ice, packs, in, the, earth, s, polar, regions, the, arctic, ice, pack, of, the, arctic, ocean, and, the, antarctic, ice, pack, of, the, southern, ocean, polar, packs, undergo, a, significant, yearly, cycling, in, surface, extent, a, natural, process, upon, which, depends, the, arctic, ecology, including, the, ocean, s, ecosystems, due, to, the, action, of, winds, currents, and, temperature, fluctuations, sea, ice, is, very, dynamic, leading, to, a, wide, variety, of, ice, types, and, features, sea, ice, may, be, contrasted, with, icebergs, which, are, chunks, of, ice, shelves, or, glaciers, that, calve, into, the, ocean, depending, on, location, sea, ice, expanses, may, also, incorporate, icebergs, sea, ice, does, not, simply, grow, and, melt, during, its, lifespan, it, is, very, dynamic, due, to, the, combined, action, of, winds, currents, water, temperature, and, air, temperature, fluctuations, sea, ice, expanses, typically, undergo, a, significant, amount, of, deformation, sea, ice, is, classified, according, to, whether, or, not, it, is, able, to, drift, and, according, to, its, age, sea, ice, can, be, classified, according, to, whether, or, not, it, is, attached, or, frozen, to, the, shoreline, or, between, shoals, or, to, grounded, icebergs, if, attached, it, is, called, landfast, ice, or, more, often, fast, ice, from, fastened, alternatively, and, unlike, fast, ice, drift, ice, occurs, further, offshore, in, very, wide, areas, and, encompasses, ice, that, is, free, to, move, with, currents, and, winds, the, physical, boundary, between, fast, ice, and, drift, ice, is, the, fast, ice, boundary, the, drift, ice, zone, may, be, further, divided, into, a, shear, zone, a, marginal, ice, zone, and, a, central, pack, drift, ice, consists, of, floes, individual, pieces, of, sea, ice, 20, metres, 66, ft, or, more, across, there, are, names, for, various, floe, sizes, small, 20, to, 100, m, 66, to, 328, ft, medium, 100, to, 500, m, 330, to, 1, 640, ft, big, 500, to, 2, 000, m, 1, 600, to, 6, 600, ft, vast, 2, to, 10, kilometres, 1, 2, to, 6, 2, mi, and, giant, more, than, 10, km, 6, 2, mi, the, term, pack, ice, is, used, either, as, a, synonym, to, drift, ice, or, to, designate, drift, ice, zone, in, which, the, floes, are, densely, packed, the, overall, sea, ice, cover, is, termed, the, ice, canopy, from, the, perspective, of, submarine, navigation, another, classification, used, by, scientists, to, describe, sea, ice, is, based, on, age, that, is, on, its, development, stages, these, stages, are, new, ice, nilas, young, ice, first, year, and, old, new, ice, is, a, general, term, used, for, recently, frozen, sea, water, that, does, not, yet, make, up, solid, ice, it, may, consist, of, frazil, ice, plates, or, spicules, of, ice, suspended, in, water, slush, water, saturated, snow, or, shuga, spongy, white, ice, lumps, a, few, centimeters, across, other, terms, such, as, grease, ice, and, pancake, ice, are, used, for, ice, crystal, accumulations, under, the, action, of, wind, and, waves, when, sea, ice, begins, to, form, on, a, beach, with, a, light, swell, ice, eggs, up, to, the, size, of, a, football, can, be, created, nilas, designates, a, sea, ice, crust, up, to, 10, centimetres, 3, 9, in, in, thickness, it, bends, without, breaking, around, waves, and, swells, nilas, can, be, further, subdivided, into, dark, nilas, up, to, 5, cm, 2, 0, in, in, thickness, and, very, dark, and, light, nilas, over, 5, cm, 2, 0, in, in, thickness, and, lighter, in, color, young, ice, is, a, transition, stage, between, nilas, and, first, year, ice, and, ranges, in, thickness, from, 10, cm, 3, 9, in, to, 30, cm, 12, in, young, ice, can, be, further, subdivided, into, grey, ice, 10, cm, 3, 9, in, to, 15, cm, 5, 9, in, in, thickness, and, grey, white, ice, 15, cm, 5, 9, in, to, 30, cm, 12, in, in, thickness, young, ice, is, not, as, flexible, as, nilas, but, tends, to, break, under, wave, action, under, compression, it, will, either, raft, at, the, grey, ice, stage, or, ridge, at, the, grey, white, ice, stage, first, year, sea, ice, is, ice, that, is, thicker, than, young, ice, but, has, no, more, than, one, year, growth, in, other, words, it, is, ice, that, grows, in, the, fall, and, winter, after, it, has, gone, through, the, new, ice, nilas, young, ice, stages, and, grows, further, but, does, not, survive, the, spring, and, summer, months, it, melts, away, the, thickness, of, this, ice, typically, ranges, from, 0, 3, m, 0, 98, ft, to, 2, m, 6, 6, ft, first, year, ice, may, be, further, divided, into, thin, 30, cm, 0, 98, ft, to, 70, cm, 2, 3, ft, medium, 70, cm, 2, 3, ft, to, 120, cm, 3, 9, ft, and, thick, 120, cm, 3, 9, ft, old, sea, ice, is, sea, ice, that, has, survived, at, least, one, melting, season, i, e, one, summer, for, this, reason, this, ice, is, generally, thicker, than, first, year, sea, ice, old, ice, is, commonly, divided, into, two, types, second, year, ice, which, has, survived, one, melting, season, and, multiyear, ice, which, has, survived, more, than, one, in, some, sources, old, ice, is, more, than, two, years, old, multi, year, ice, is, much, more, common, in, the, arctic, than, it, is, in, the, antarctic, the, thickness, of, old, sea, ice, typically, ranges, from, 2, to, 4, m, the, reason, for, this, is, that, sea, ice, in, the, south, drifts, into, warmer, waters, where, it, melts, in, the, arctic, much, of, the, sea, ice, is, land, locked, while, fast, ice, is, relatively, stable, because, it, is, attached, to, the, shoreline, or, the, seabed, drift, or, pack, ice, undergoes, relatively, complex, deformation, processes, that, ultimately, give, rise, to, sea, ice, s, typically, wide, variety, of, landscapes, wind, is, the, main, driving, force, along, with, ocean, currents, the, coriolis, force, and, sea, ice, surface, tilt, have, also, been, invoked, these, driving, forces, induce, a, state, of, stress, within, the, drift, ice, zone, an, ice, floe, converging, toward, another, and, pushing, against, it, will, generate, a, state, of, compression, at, the, boundary, between, both, the, ice, cover, may, also, undergo, a, state, of, tension, resulting, in, divergence, and, fissure, opening, if, two, floes, drift, sideways, past, each, other, while, remaining, in, contact, this, will, create, a, state, of, shear, sea, ice, deformation, results, from, the, interaction, between, ice, floes, as, they, are, driven, against, each, other, the, result, may, be, of, three, types, of, features, 1, rafted, ice, when, one, piece, is, overriding, another, 2, pressure, ridges, a, line, of, broken, ice, forced, downward, to, make, up, the, keel, and, upward, to, make, the, sail, and, 3, hummock, a, hillock, of, broken, ice, that, forms, an, uneven, surface, a, shear, ridge, is, a, pressure, ridge, that, formed, under, shear, it, tends, to, be, more, linear, than, a, ridge, induced, only, by, compression, a, new, ridge, is, a, recent, feature, it, is, sharp, crested, with, its, side, sloping, at, an, angle, exceeding, 40, degrees, in, contrast, a, weathered, ridge, is, one, with, a, rounded, crest, and, with, sides, sloping, at, less, than, 40, degrees, stamukhi, are, yet, another, type, of, pile, up, but, these, are, grounded, and, are, therefore, relatively, stationary, they, result, from, the, interaction, between, fast, ice, and, the, drifting, pack, ice, level, ice, is, sea, ice, that, has, not, been, affected, by, deformation, and, is, therefore, relatively, flat, leads, and, polynyas, are, areas, of, open, water, that, occur, within, sea, ice, expanses, even, though, air, temperatures, are, below, freezing, and, provide, a, direct, interaction, between, the, ocean, and, the, atmosphere, which, is, important, for, the, wildlife, leads, are, narrow, and, linear, they, vary, in, width, from, meter, to, km, scale, during, the, winter, the, water, in, leads, quickly, freezes, up, they, are, also, used, for, navigation, purposes, even, when, refrozen, the, ice, in, leads, is, thinner, allowing, icebreakers, access, to, an, easier, sail, path, and, submarines, to, surface, more, easily, polynyas, are, more, uniform, in, size, than, leads, and, are, also, larger, two, types, are, recognized, 1, sensible, heat, polynyas, caused, by, the, upwelling, of, warmer, water, and, 2, latent, heat, polynyas, resulting, from, persistent, winds, from, the, coastline, only, the, top, layer, of, water, needs, to, cool, to, the, freezing, point, convection, of, the, surface, layer, involves, the, top, 100, 150, m, 330, 490, ft, down, to, the, pycnocline, of, increased, density, in, calm, water, the, first, sea, ice, to, form, on, the, surface, is, a, skim, of, separate, crystals, which, initially, are, in, the, form, of, tiny, discs, floating, flat, on, the, surface, and, of, diameter, less, than, 0, 3, cm, 0, 12, in, each, disc, has, its, c, axis, vertical, and, grows, outwards, laterally, at, a, certain, point, such, a, disc, shape, becomes, unstable, and, the, growing, isolated, crystals, take, on, a, hexagonal, stellar, form, with, long, fragile, arms, stretching, out, over, the, surface, these, crystals, also, have, their, c, axis, vertical, the, dendritic, arms, are, very, fragile, and, soon, break, off, leaving, a, mixture, of, discs, and, arm, fragments, with, any, kind, of, turbulence, in, the, water, these, fragments, break, up, further, into, random, shaped, small, crystals, which, form, a, suspension, of, increasing, density, in, the, surface, water, an, ice, type, called, frazil, or, grease, ice, in, quiet, conditions, the, frazil, crystals, soon, freeze, together, to, form, a, continuous, thin, sheet, of, young, ice, in, its, early, stages, when, it, is, still, transparent, that, is, the, ice, called, nilas, once, nilas, has, formed, a, quite, different, growth, process, occurs, in, which, water, freezes, on, to, the, bottom, of, the, existing, ice, sheet, a, process, called, congelation, growth, this, growth, process, yields, first, year, ice, in, rough, water, fresh, sea, ice, is, formed, by, the, cooling, of, the, ocean, as, heat, is, lost, into, the, atmosphere, the, uppermost, layer, of, the, ocean, is, supercooled, to, slightly, below, the, freezing, point, at, which, time, tiny, ice, platelets, frazil, ice, form, with, time, this, process, leads, to, a, mushy, surface, layer, known, as, grease, ice, frazil, ice, formation, may, also, be, started, by, snowfall, rather, than, supercooling, waves, and, wind, then, act, to, compress, these, ice, particles, into, larger, plates, of, several, meters, in, diameter, called, pancake, ice, these, float, on, the, ocean, surface, and, collide, with, one, another, forming, upturned, edges, in, time, the, pancake, ice, plates, may, themselves, be, rafted, over, one, another, or, frozen, together, into, a, more, solid, ice, cover, known, as, consolidated, pancake, ice, such, ice, has, a, very, rough, appearance, on, top, and, bottom, if, sufficient, snow, falls, on, sea, ice, to, depress, the, freeboard, below, sea, level, sea, water, will, flow, in, and, a, layer, of, ice, will, form, of, mixed, snow, sea, water, this, is, particularly, common, around, antarctica, russian, scientist, vladimir, vize, 1886, 1954, devoted, his, life, to, study, the, arctic, ice, pack, and, developed, the, scientific, prediction, of, ice, conditions, theory, for, which, he, was, widely, acclaimed, in, academic, circles, he, applied, this, theory, in, the, field, in, the, kara, sea, which, led, to, the, discovery, of, vize, island, the, annual, freeze, and, melt, cycle, is, set, by, the, annual, cycle, of, solar, insolation, and, of, ocean, and, atmospheric, temperature, and, of, variability, in, this, annual, cycle, in, the, arctic, the, area, of, ocean, covered, by, sea, ice, increases, over, winter, from, a, minimum, in, september, to, a, maximum, in, march, or, sometimes, february, before, melting, over, the, summer, in, the, antarctic, where, the, seasons, are, reversed, the, annual, minimum, is, typically, in, february, and, the, annual, maximum, in, september, or, october, and, the, presence, of, sea, ice, abutting, the, calving, fronts, of, ice, shelves, has, been, shown, to, influence, glacier, flow, and, potentially, the, stability, of, the, antarctic, ice, sheet, the, growth, and, melt, rate, are, also, affected, by, the, state, of, the, ice, itself, during, growth, the, ice, thickening, due, to, freezing, as, opposed, to, dynamics, is, itself, dependent, on, the, thickness, so, that, the, ice, growth, slows, as, the, ice, thickens, likewise, during, melt, thinner, sea, ice, melts, faster, this, leads, to, different, behaviour, between, multiyear, and, first, year, ice, in, addition, melt, ponds, on, the, ice, surface, during, the, melt, season, lower, the, albedo, such, that, more, solar, radiation, is, absorbed, leading, to, a, feedback, where, melt, is, accelerated, the, presence, of, melt, ponds, is, affected, by, the, permeability, of, the, sea, ice, i, e, whether, meltwater, can, drain, and, the, topography, of, the, sea, ice, surface, i, e, the, presence, of, natural, basins, for, the, melt, ponds, to, form, in, first, year, ice, is, flatter, than, multiyear, ice, due, to, the, lack, of, dynamic, ridging, so, ponds, tend, to, have, greater, area, they, also, have, lower, albedo, since, they, are, on, thinner, ice, which, blocks, less, of, the, solar, radiation, from, reaching, the, dark, ocean, below, sea, ice, is, a, composite, material, made, up, of, pure, ice, liquid, brine, air, and, salt, the, volumetric, fractions, of, these, components, ice, brine, and, air, determine, the, key, physical, properties, of, sea, ice, including, thermal, conductivity, heat, capacity, latent, heat, density, elastic, modulus, and, mechanical, strength, brine, volume, fraction, depends, on, sea, ice, salinity, and, temperature, while, sea, ice, salinity, mainly, depends, on, ice, age, and, thickness, during, the, ice, growth, period, its, bulk, brine, volume, is, typically, below, 5, air, volume, fraction, during, ice, growth, period, is, typically, around, 1, 2, but, may, substantially, increase, upon, ice, warming, air, volume, of, sea, ice, in, can, be, as, high, as, 15, in, summer, and, 4, in, autumn, both, brine, and, air, volumes, influence, sea, ice, density, values, which, are, typically, around, 840, 910, kg, m, 3, for, first, year, ice, sea, ice, density, is, a, significant, source, of, errors, in, sea, ice, thickness, retrieval, using, radar, and, laser, satellite, altimetry, resulting, in, uncertainties, of, 0, 3, 0, 4, m, changes, in, sea, ice, conditions, are, best, demonstrated, by, the, rate, of, melting, over, time, a, composite, record, of, arctic, ice, demonstrates, that, the, floes, retreat, began, around, 1900, experiencing, more, rapid, melting, beginning, within, the, past, 50, years, satellite, study, of, sea, ice, began, in, 1979, and, became, a, much, more, reliable, measure, of, long, term, changes, in, sea, ice, in, comparison, to, the, extended, record, the, sea, ice, extent, in, the, polar, region, by, september, 2007, was, only, half, the, recorded, mass, that, had, been, estimated, to, exist, within, the, 1950, 1970, period, arctic, sea, ice, extent, ice, hit, an, all, time, low, in, september, 2012, when, the, ice, was, determined, to, cover, only, 24, of, the, arctic, ocean, offsetting, the, previous, low, of, 29, in, 2007, predictions, of, when, the, first, ice, free, arctic, summer, might, occur, vary, antarctic, sea, ice, extent, gradually, increased, in, the, period, of, satellite, observations, which, began, in, 1979, until, a, rapid, decline, in, southern, hemisphere, spring, of, 2016, sea, ice, provides, an, ecosystem, for, various, polar, species, particularly, the, polar, bear, whose, environment, is, being, threatened, as, global, warming, causes, the, ice, to, melt, more, as, the, earth, s, temperature, gets, warmer, furthermore, the, sea, ice, itself, functions, to, help, keep, polar, climates, cool, since, the, ice, exists, in, expansive, enough, amounts, to, maintain, a, cold, environment, at, this, sea, ice, s, relationship, with, global, warming, is, cyclical, the, ice, helps, to, maintain, cool, climates, but, as, the, global, temperature, increases, the, ice, melts, and, is, less, effective, in, keeping, those, climates, cold, the, bright, shiny, surface, albedo, of, the, ice, also, serves, a, role, in, maintaining, cooler, polar, temperatures, by, reflecting, much, of, the, sunlight, that, hits, it, back, into, space, as, the, sea, ice, melts, its, surface, area, shrinks, diminishing, the, size, of, the, reflective, surface, and, therefore, causing, the, earth, to, absorb, more, of, the, sun, s, heat, as, the, ice, melts, it, lowers, the, albedo, thus, causing, more, heat, to, be, absorbed, by, the, earth, and, further, increase, the, amount, of, melting, ice, though, the, size, of, the, ice, floes, is, affected, by, the, seasons, even, a, small, change, in, global, temperature, can, greatly, affect, the, amount, of, sea, ice, and, due, to, the, shrinking, reflective, surface, that, keeps, the, ocean, cool, this, sparks, a, cycle, of, ice, shrinking, and, temperatures, warming, as, a, result, the, polar, regions, are, the, most, susceptible, places, to, climate, change, on, the, planet, furthermore, sea, ice, affects, the, movement, of, ocean, waters, in, the, freezing, process, much, of, the, salt, in, ocean, water, is, squeezed, out, of, the, frozen, crystal, formations, though, some, remains, frozen, in, the, ice, this, salt, becomes, trapped, beneath, the, sea, ice, creating, a, higher, concentration, of, salt, in, the, water, beneath, ice, floes, this, concentration, of, salt, contributes, to, the, salinated, water, s, density, and, this, cold, denser, water, sinks, to, the, bottom, of, the, ocean, this, cold, water, moves, along, the, ocean, floor, towards, the, equator, while, warmer, water, on, the, ocean, surface, moves, in, the, direction, of, the, poles, this, is, referred, to, as, conveyor, belt, motion, and, is, a, regularly, occurring, process, in, order, to, gain, a, better, understanding, about, the, variability, numerical, sea, ice, models, are, used, to, perform, sensitivity, studies, the, two, main, ingredients, are, the, ice, dynamics, and, the, thermodynamical, properties, see, sea, ice, emissivity, modelling, sea, ice, growth, processes, and, sea, ice, thickness, there, are, many, sea, ice, model, computer, codes, available, for, doing, this, including, the, cice, numerical, suite, many, global, climate, models, gcms, have, sea, ice, implemented, in, their, numerical, simulation, scheme, in, order, to, capture, the, ice, albedo, feedback, correctly, examples, include, the, coupled, model, intercomparison, project, offers, a, standard, protocol, for, studying, the, output, of, coupled, atmosphere, ocean, general, circulation, models, the, coupling, takes, place, at, the, atmosphere, ocean, interface, where, the, sea, ice, may, occur, in, addition, to, global, modeling, various, regional, models, deal, with, sea, ice, regional, models, are, employed, for, seasonal, forecasting, experiments, and, for, process, studies, sea, ice, is, part, of, the, earth, s, biosphere, when, sea, water, freezes, the, ice, is, riddled, with, brine, filled, channels, which, sustain, sympagic, organisms, such, as, bacteria, algae, copepods, and, annelids, which, in, turn, provide, food, for, animals, such, as, krill, and, specialised, fish, like, the, bald, notothen, fed, upon, in, turn, by, larger, animals, such, as, emperor, penguins, and, minke, whales, a, decline, of, seasonal, sea, ice, puts, the, survival, of, arctic, species, such, as, ringed, seals, and, polar, bears, at, risk, other, element, and, compounds, have, been, speculated, to, exist, as, oceans, and, seas, on, extraterrestrial, planets, scientists, notably, suspect, the, existence, of, icebergs, of, solid, diamond, and, corresponding, seas, of, liquid, carbon, on, the, ice, giants, neptune, and, uranus, this, is, due, to, extreme, pressure, and, heat, at, the, core, that, would, turn, carbon, into, a, supercritical, fluid
