a, week, is, a, unit, of, time, equal, to, seven, days, it, is, the, standard, time, period, used, for, short, cycles, of, days, in, most, parts, of, the, world, the, days, are, often, used, to, indicate, common, work, days, and, rest, days, as, well, as, days, of, worship, weeks, are, often, mapped, against, yearly, calendars, but, are, typically, not, the, basis, for, them, as, weeks, are, not, based, on, astronomy, ancient, cultures, had, different, week, lengths, including, ten, in, egypt, and, an, eight, day, week, for, etruscans, the, etruscan, week, was, adopted, by, the, ancient, romans, but, they, later, moved, to, a, seven, day, week, which, had, spread, across, western, asia, and, the, eastern, mediterranean, due, to, the, influence, of, the, christian, seven, day, week, which, is, rooted, in, the, jewish, seven, day, week, in, 321, ce, emperor, constantine, the, great, officially, decreed, a, seven, day, week, in, the, roman, empire, including, making, sunday, a, public, holiday, this, later, spread, across, europe, then, the, rest, of, the, world, in, english, the, names, of, the, days, of, the, week, are, monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday, and, sunday, in, many, languages, including, english, the, days, of, the, week, are, named, after, gods, or, classical, planets, saturday, has, kept, its, roman, name, while, the, other, six, days, use, germanic, equivalents, such, a, week, may, be, called, a, planetary, week, i, e, a, classical, planetary, week, certain, weeks, within, a, year, may, be, designated, for, a, particular, purpose, such, as, golden, week, in, china, and, japan, and, national, family, week, in, canada, more, informally, certain, groups, may, advocate, awareness, weeks, which, are, designed, to, draw, attention, to, a, certain, subject, or, cause, the, term, week, may, also, be, used, to, refer, to, a, sub, section, of, the, week, such, as, the, workweek, and, weekend, cultures, vary, in, which, days, of, the, week, are, designated, the, first, and, the, last, though, virtually, all, have, saturday, sunday, or, monday, as, the, first, day, the, geneva, based, iso, standards, organization, uses, monday, as, the, first, day, of, the, week, in, its, iso, week, date, system, through, the, international, iso, 8601, standard, most, of, europe, and, china, consider, monday, the, first, day, of, the, work, week, while, north, america, israel, south, asia, and, many, catholic, and, protestant, countries, consider, sunday, the, first, day, of, the, week, saturday, is, judged, as, the, first, day, of, the, week, in, much, of, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, due, to, the, islamic, influence, other, regions, are, mixed, but, typically, observe, either, sunday, or, monday, as, the, first, day, the, three, abrahamic, religions, observe, different, days, of, the, week, as, their, holy, day, jews, observe, their, sabbath, shabbat, on, saturday, the, seventh, day, from, sundown, friday, to, sundown, saturday, in, honor, of, god, s, creation, of, the, world, in, six, days, and, then, resting, on, the, seventh, most, christians, observe, sunday, the, lord, s, day, the, first, day, of, the, week, in, traditional, christian, calendars, in, honor, of, the, resurrection, of, jesus, muslims, observe, their, day, of, congregation, known, as, yaum, al, jum, ah, on, friday, because, it, was, described, as, a, sacred, day, of, congregational, worship, in, the, quran, the, english, word, week, comes, from, the, old, english, wice, ultimately, from, a, common, germanic, wik, n, from, a, root, wik, turn, move, change, the, germanic, word, probably, had, a, wider, meaning, prior, to, the, adoption, of, the, roman, calendar, perhaps, succession, series, as, suggested, by, gothic, wik, translating, taxis, order, in, luke, 1, 8, the, seven, day, week, is, named, in, many, languages, by, a, word, derived, from, seven, the, archaism, sennight, seven, night, preserves, the, old, germanic, practice, of, reckoning, time, by, nights, as, in, the, more, common, fortnight, fourteen, night, hebdomad, and, hebdomadal, week, both, derive, from, the, greek, hebdom, s, a, seven, septimana, is, cognate, with, the, romance, terms, derived, from, latin, septimana, seven, mornings, slavic, has, a, formation, t, d, n, serbian, tjedan, croatian, tjedan, ukrainian, tyzhden, czech, t, den, polish, tydzie, from, t, this, d, n, day, chinese, has, as, it, were, planetary, time, unit, an, older, chinese, form, is, meaning, week, religious, ceremony, a, week, is, defined, as, an, interval, of, exactly, seven, days, so, that, except, when, passing, through, daylight, saving, time, transitions, or, leap, seconds, with, respect, to, the, gregorian, calendar, in, a, gregorian, mean, year, there, are, 365, 2425, days, and, thus, exactly, 52, 71, 400, or, 52, 1775, weeks, unlike, the, julian, year, of, 365, 25, days, or, 52, 5, 28, 52, 1786, weeks, which, cannot, be, represented, by, a, finite, decimal, expansion, there, are, exactly, 20, 871, weeks, in, 400, gregorian, years, so, 13, september, 1624, was, a, friday, just, as, was, 13, september, 2024, relative, to, the, path, of, the, moon, a, week, is, 23, 659, of, an, average, lunation, or, 94, 637, of, an, average, quarter, lunation, historically, the, system, of, dominical, letters, letters, a, to, g, identifying, the, weekday, of, the, first, day, of, a, given, year, has, been, used, to, facilitate, calculation, of, the, day, of, week, the, day, of, the, week, can, be, easily, calculated, given, a, date, s, julian, day, number, jd, i, e, the, integer, value, at, noon, ut, adding, one, to, the, remainder, after, dividing, the, julian, day, number, by, seven, jd, modulo, 7, 1, yields, that, date, s, iso, 8601, day, of, the, week, for, example, the, julian, day, number, of, 13, september, 2024, is, 2460567, calculating, 2460567, mod, 7, 1, yields, 5, corresponding, to, friday, in, 1973, john, conway, devised, the, doomsday, rule, for, mental, calculation, of, the, weekday, of, any, date, in, any, year, the, days, of, the, week, were, named, for, the, seven, classical, planets, which, included, the, sun, and, moon, this, naming, system, persisted, alongside, an, ecclesiastical, tradition, of, numbering, the, days, in, ecclesiastical, latin, beginning, with, dominica, the, lord, s, day, as, the, first, day, the, greco, roman, gods, associated, with, the, classical, planets, were, rendered, in, their, interpretatio, germanica, at, some, point, during, the, late, roman, empire, yielding, the, germanic, tradition, of, names, based, on, indigenous, deities, the, ordering, of, the, weekday, names, is, not, the, classical, order, of, the, planets, by, distance, in, the, planetary, spheres, model, nor, equivalently, by, their, apparent, speed, of, movement, in, the, night, sky, instead, the, planetary, hours, systems, resulted, in, succeeding, days, being, named, for, planets, that, are, three, places, apart, in, their, traditional, listing, this, characteristic, was, apparently, discussed, in, plutarch, in, a, treatise, written, in, c, 100, ce, which, is, reported, to, have, addressed, the, question, of, why, are, the, days, named, after, the, planets, reckoned, in, a, different, order, from, the, actual, order, the, text, of, plutarch, s, treatise, has, been, lost, dio, cassius, early, 3rd, century, gives, two, explanations, in, a, section, of, his, historia, romana, after, mentioning, the, jewish, practice, of, sanctifying, the, day, called, the, day, of, kronos, saturday, raviv, ra, bh, nuv, sara, dityav, ra, somav, ra, induv, sara, saumyav, sara, sthirav, sara, an, ecclesiastical, non, astrological, system, of, numbering, the, days, of, the, week, was, adopted, in, late, antiquity, this, model, also, seems, to, have, influenced, presumably, via, gothic, the, designation, of, wednesday, as, mid, week, in, old, high, german, mittawehha, and, old, church, slavonic, old, church, slavonic, may, have, also, modeled, the, name, of, monday, after, the, latin, feria, secunda, the, ecclesiastical, system, became, prevalent, in, eastern, christianity, but, in, the, latin, west, it, remains, extant, only, in, modern, icelandic, galician, and, portuguese, the, earliest, evidence, of, an, astrological, significance, of, a, seven, day, period, is, decree, of, king, sargon, of, akkad, around, 2300, bce, akkadians, venerated, the, number, seven, and, the, key, celestial, bodies, visible, to, the, naked, eye, numbered, seven, the, sun, the, moon, and, the, five, closest, planets, gudea, the, priest, king, of, lagash, in, sumer, during, the, gutian, dynasty, about, 2100, bce, built, a, seven, room, temple, which, he, dedicated, with, a, seven, day, festival, in, the, flood, story, of, the, assyro, babylonian, epic, of, gilgamesh, the, storm, lasts, for, seven, days, the, dove, is, sent, out, after, seven, days, similarly, to, genesis, and, the, noah, like, character, of, utnapishtim, leaves, the, ark, seven, days, after, it, reaches, the, firm, ground, counting, from, the, new, moon, the, babylonians, celebrated, the, 7th, 14th, 21st, and, 28th, of, the, approximately, 29, or, 30, day, lunar, month, as, holy, days, also, called, evil, days, meaning, inauspicious, for, certain, activities, on, these, days, officials, were, prohibited, from, various, activities, and, common, men, were, forbidden, to, make, a, wish, and, at, least, the, 28th, was, known, as, a, rest, day, on, each, of, them, offerings, were, made, to, a, different, god, and, goddess, though, similar, the, later, practice, of, associating, days, of, the, week, with, deities, or, planets, is, not, due, to, the, babylonians, a, continuous, seven, day, cycle, that, runs, throughout, history, without, reference, to, the, phases, of, the, moon, was, first, practiced, in, judaism, dated, to, the, 6th, century, bce, at, the, latest, there, are, several, hypotheses, concerning, the, origin, of, the, biblical, seven, day, cycle, friedrich, delitzsch, and, others, suggested, that, the, seven, day, week, being, approximately, a, quarter, of, a, lunation, is, the, implicit, astronomical, origin, of, the, seven, day, week, and, indeed, the, babylonian, calendar, used, intercalary, days, to, synchronize, the, last, week, of, a, month, with, the, new, moon, according, to, this, theory, the, jewish, week, was, adopted, from, the, babylonians, while, removing, the, moon, dependency, george, aaron, barton, speculated, that, the, seven, day, creation, account, of, genesis, is, connected, to, the, babylonian, creation, epic, en, ma, eli, which, is, recorded, on, seven, tablets, in, a, frequently, quoted, suggestion, going, back, to, the, early, 20th, century, the, hebrew, sabbath, is, compared, to, the, sumerian, sa, bat, mid, rest, a, term, for, the, full, moon, the, sumerian, term, has, been, reconstructed, as, rendered, sapattu, m, or, sabattu, m, in, babylonian, possibly, present, in, the, lost, fifth, tablet, of, the, en, ma, eli, tentatively, reconstructed, bbath, shalt, thou, then, encounter, mid, ly, however, niels, erik, andreasen, jeffrey, h, tigay, and, others, claim, that, the, biblical, sabbath, is, mentioned, as, a, day, of, rest, in, some, of, the, earliest, layers, of, the, pentateuch, dated, to, the, 9th, century, bce, at, the, latest, centuries, before, the, babylonian, exile, of, judah, they, also, find, the, resemblance, between, the, biblical, sabbath, and, the, babylonian, system, to, be, weak, therefore, they, suggest, that, the, seven, day, week, may, reflect, an, independent, israelite, tradition, tigay, writes, it, is, clear, that, among, neighboring, nations, that, were, in, position, to, have, an, influence, over, israel, and, in, fact, which, did, influence, it, in, various, matters, there, is, no, precise, parallel, to, the, israelite, sabbatical, week, this, leads, to, the, conclusion, that, the, sabbatical, week, which, is, as, unique, to, israel, as, the, sabbath, from, which, it, flows, is, an, independent, israelite, creation, the, seven, day, week, seems, to, have, been, adopted, at, different, stages, by, the, persian, empire, in, hellenistic, astrology, and, via, greek, transmission, in, gupta, india, and, tang, china, the, babylonian, system, was, received, by, the, greeks, in, the, 4th, century, bce, notably, via, eudoxus, of, cnidus, although, some, sources, such, as, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, state, that, the, babylonians, named, the, days, of, the, week, after, the, five, planets, the, sun, and, the, moon, many, scholars, disagree, eviatar, zerubavel, says, the, establishment, of, a, seven, day, week, based, on, the, regular, observance, of, the, sabbath, is, a, distinctively, jewish, contribution, to, civilization, the, choice, of, the, number, 7, as, the, basis, for, the, jewish, week, might, have, had, an, assyrian, or, babylonian, origin, yet, it, is, crucial, to, remember, that, the, ancient, dwellers, of, mesopotamia, themselves, did, not, have, a, seven, day, week, the, astrological, concept, of, planetary, hours, is, an, innovation, of, hellenistic, astrology, probably, first, conceived, in, the, 2nd, century, bce, the, seven, day, week, was, widely, known, throughout, the, roman, empire, by, the, 1st, century, ce, along, with, references, to, the, jewish, sabbath, by, roman, authors, such, as, seneca, and, ovid, when, the, seven, day, week, came, into, use, in, rome, during, the, early, imperial, period, it, did, not, immediately, replace, the, older, eight, day, nundinal, system, the, nundinal, system, had, probably, fallen, out, of, use, by, the, time, emperor, constantine, adopted, the, seven, day, week, for, official, use, in, ce, 321, making, the, day, of, the, sun, dies, solis, a, legal, holiday, the, zoroastrian, calendar, follows, the, babylonian, in, relating, the, 7th, 14th, 21st, and, 28th, of, the, 29, or, 30, day, lunar, month, to, ahura, mazda, the, forerunner, of, all, modern, zoroastrian, calendars, is, the, system, used, to, determine, dates, in, the, persian, empire, adopted, from, the, babylonian, calendar, by, the, 4th, century, bce, frank, c, senn, in, his, book, christian, liturgy, catholic, and, evangelical, points, to, data, suggesting, evidence, of, an, early, continuous, use, of, a, seven, day, week, referring, to, the, jews, during, the, babylonian, captivity, in, the, 6th, century, bce, after, the, destruction, of, the, temple, of, solomon, while, the, seven, day, week, in, judaism, is, tied, to, creation, account, in, the, book, of, genesis, in, the, hebrew, bible, where, god, creates, the, heavens, and, the, earth, in, six, days, and, rests, on, the, seventh, genesis, 1, 1, 2, 3, in, the, book, of, exodus, the, fourth, of, the, ten, commandments, is, to, rest, on, the, seventh, day, shabbat, which, can, be, seen, as, implying, a, socially, instituted, seven, day, week, it, is, not, clear, whether, the, genesis, narrative, predates, the, babylonian, captivity, of, the, jews, in, the, 6th, century, bce, at, least, since, the, second, temple, period, under, persian, rule, judaism, relied, on, the, seven, day, cycle, of, recurring, sabbaths, tablets, from, the, achaemenid, period, indicate, that, the, lunation, of, 29, or, 30, days, basically, contained, three, seven, day, weeks, and, a, final, week, of, eight, or, nine, days, inclusive, breaking, the, continuous, seven, day, cycle, the, babylonians, additionally, celebrated, the, 19th, as, a, special, evil, day, the, day, of, anger, because, it, was, roughly, the, 49th, day, of, the, preceding, month, completing, a, week, of, weeks, also, with, sacrifices, and, prohibitions, difficulties, with, friedrich, delitzsch, s, origin, theory, connecting, hebrew, shabbat, with, the, babylonian, lunar, cycle, include, reconciling, the, differences, between, an, unbroken, week, and, a, lunar, week, and, explaining, the, absence, of, texts, naming, the, lunar, week, as, shabbat, in, any, language, in, jewish, sources, by, the, time, of, the, septuagint, the, term, sabbath, greek, romanized, s, bbaton, by, synecdoche, also, came, to, refer, to, an, entire, seven, day, week, the, interval, between, two, weekly, sabbaths, jesus, s, parable, of, the, pharisee, and, the, publican, luke, 18, 12, describes, the, pharisee, as, fasting, twice, in, the, week, greek, romanized, dis, tou, sabbatou, in, the, account, of, the, women, finding, the, tomb, empty, they, are, described, as, coming, there, toward, the, one, of, the, sabbaths, greek, translations, substitute, week, for, sabbaths, the, ancient, romans, traditionally, used, the, eight, day, nundinum, but, after, the, julian, calendar, had, come, into, effect, in, 45, bce, the, seven, day, week, came, into, increasing, use, for, a, while, the, week, and, the, nundinal, cycle, coexisted, but, by, the, time, the, week, was, officially, adopted, by, constantine, in, 321, ce, the, nundinal, cycle, had, fallen, out, of, use, the, association, of, the, days, of, the, week, with, the, sun, the, moon, and, the, five, planets, visible, to, the, naked, eye, dates, to, the, roman, era, 2nd, century, the, continuous, seven, day, cycle, of, the, days, of, the, week, can, be, traced, back, to, the, reign, of, augustus, the, first, identifiable, date, cited, complete, with, day, of, the, week, is, 6, february, 60, ce, identified, as, a, sunday, as, viii, idus, februarius, dies, solis, eighth, day, before, the, ides, of, february, day, of, the, sun, in, a, pompeiian, graffito, according, to, the, contemporary, julian, calendar, 6, february, 60, was, however, a, wednesday, this, is, explained, by, the, existence, of, two, conventions, of, naming, days, of, the, weeks, based, on, the, planetary, hours, system, 6, february, was, a, sunday, based, on, the, sunset, naming, convention, and, a, wednesday, based, on, the, sunrise, naming, convention, according, to, islamic, beliefs, the, seven, day, a, week, concept, started, with, the, creation, of, the, universe, by, allah, abu, huraira, reported, that, muhammad, said, allah, the, exalted, and, glorious, created, the, clay, on, saturday, and, he, created, the, mountains, on, sunday, and, he, created, the, trees, on, monday, and, he, created, the, things, entailing, labour, on, tuesday, and, created, light, on, wednesday, and, he, caused, the,

earliest, known, reference, in, chinese, writings, to, a, seven, day, week, is, attributed, to, fan, ning, who, lived, in, the, late, 4th, century, in, the, jin, dynasty, while, diffusions, from, the, manichaeans, are, documented, with, the, writings, of, the, chinese, buddhist, monk, yi, jing, and, the, ceylonese, or, central, asian, buddhist, monk, bu, kong, of, the, 7th, century, tang, dynasty,

the, seven, day, system, in, use, in, heian, period, japan, as, early, as, 1007, in, japan, the, seven, day, system, was, kept, in, use, for, astrological, purposes, until, its, promotion, to, a, full, fledged, western, style, calendrical, basis, during, the, meiji, period, 1868, 1912, the, seven, day, week, was, known, in, india, by, the, 6th, century, referenced, in, the, pa, casiddh, ntik,

and, hence, in, western, history, for, almost, two, millennia, despite, changes, to, the, coptic, julian, and, gregorian, calendars, demonstrated, by, the, date, of, easter, sunday, having, been, traced, back, through, numerous, computistic, tables, to, an, ethiopic, copy, of, an, early, alexandrian, table, beginning, with, the, easter, of, 311, ce, a, tradition, of, divinations, arranged, for, the, days, of, the, week, on, which, certain, feast, days, occur, develops, in, the, early, medieval, period, there, are, many, later, variants, of, this, including, the, german, bauern, praktik, and, the, versions, of, erra, pater, published, in, 16th, to, 17th, century, england, mocked, in, samuel, butler, s, hudibras, south, and, east, slavic, versions, are, known, as, koliadniki, from,

calendar, year, can, be, numbered, for, each, year, this, style, of, numbering, is, often, used, in, european, and, asian, countries, it, is, less, common, in, the, u, s, and, elsewhere, the, system, for, numbering, weeks, is, the, iso, week, date, system, which, is, included, in, iso, 8601, this, system, dictates, that, each, week, begins, on, a, monday, and, is, associated, with, the, year, that, contains, that, week, s, thursday, in, practice, week, 1, w01, in, iso, notation, of, any, year, can, be, determined, as, follows, examples, it, is, also, possible, to, determine, if, the, last, week, of, the, previous, year, was, week, 52, or, week, 53, as, follows, notes, 1, numbers, and, letters, in, parentheses, apply, to, march, december, in, leap, years, 2, underlined, numbers, and, letters, belong, to, previous, year, or, next, year, 3, first, date, of, the, first, week, in, the, year, 4, first, date, of, the, last, week, in, the, year, in, some, countries, though, the, numbering, system, is, different, from, the, iso, standard, at, least, six, numberings, are, in, use, because, the, week, starts, on, either, saturday, sunday, or, monday, in, all, these, systems, the, days, in, a, workweek, monday, through, friday, will, always, have, the, same, week, number, within, a, calendar, week, system, quite, often, these, systems, will, agree, on, the, week, number, for, each, day, in, a, workweek, note, that, this, agreement, occurs, only, for, the, week, number, of, each, day, in, a, work, week, not, for, the, day, number, within, the, week, nor, the, week,
