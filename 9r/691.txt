the, paleogene, period, ipa, p, e, l, i, d, i, n, l, i, o, p, l, i, pay, lee, jeen, lee, oh, pal, ee, also, spelled, palaeogene, or, pal, ogene, is, a, geologic, period, and, system, that, spans, 43, million, years, from, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, period, 66, ma, million, years, ago, to, the, beginning, of, the, neogene, period, 23, 03, ma, it, is, the, first, period, of, the, cenozoic, era, and, is, divided, into, the, paleocene, eocene, and, oligocene, epochs, the, earlier, term, tertiary, period, was, used, to, define, the, time, now, covered, by, the, paleogene, period, and, subsequent, neogene, period, despite, no, longer, being, recognized, as, a, formal, stratigraphic, term, tertiary, still, sometimes, remains, in, informal, use, paleogene, is, often, abbreviated, pg, although, the, united, states, geological, survey, uses, the, abbreviation, pe, for, the, paleogene, on, the, survey, s, geologic, maps, during, the, paleogene, period, mammals, continued, to, diversify, from, relatively, small, simple, forms, into, a, large, group, of, diverse, animals, in, the, wake, of, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, that, ended, the, preceding, cretaceous, period, the, period, is, marked, by, considerable, changes, in, climate, from, the, paleocene, eocene, thermal, maximum, through, global, cooling, during, the, eocene, to, the, first, appearance, of, permanent, ice, sheets, in, the, antarctic, at, the, beginning, of, the, oligocene, the, paleogene, is, divided, into, three, series, epochs, the, paleocene, eocene, and, oligocene, these, stratigraphic, units, can, be, defined, globally, or, regionally, for, global, stratigraphic, correlation, the, international, commission, on, stratigraphy, ics, ratify, global, stages, based, on, a, global, boundary, stratotype, section, and, point, gssp, from, a, single, formation, a, stratotype, identifying, the, lower, boundary, of, the, stage, the, paleocene, is, the, first, series, epoch, of, the, paleogene, and, lasted, from, 66, 0, ma, to, 56, 0, ma, it, is, divided, into, three, stages, the, danian, 66, 0, 61, 6, ma, selandian, 61, 6, 59, 2, ma, and, thanetian, 59, 2, 56, 0, ma, the, gssp, for, the, base, of, the, cenozoic, paleogene, and, paleocene, is, at, oued, djerfane, west, of, el, kef, tunisia, it, is, marked, by, an, iridium, anomaly, produced, by, an, asteroid, impact, and, is, associated, with, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, the, boundary, is, defined, as, the, rusty, colored, base, of, a, 50, cm, thick, clay, which, would, have, been, deposited, over, only, a, few, days, similar, layers, are, seen, in, marine, and, continental, deposits, worldwide, these, layers, include, the, iridium, anomaly, microtektites, nickel, rich, spinel, crystals, and, shocked, quartz, all, indicators, of, a, major, extraterrestrial, impact, the, remains, of, the, crater, are, found, at, chicxulub, on, the, yucatan, peninsula, in, mexico, the, extinction, of, the, non, avian, dinosaurs, ammonites, and, dramatic, changes, in, marine, plankton, and, many, other, groups, of, organisms, are, also, used, for, correlation, purposes, the, eocene, is, the, second, series, epoch, of, the, paleogene, and, lasted, from, 56, 0, ma, to, 33, 9, ma, it, is, divided, into, four, stages, the, ypresian, 56, 0, ma, to, 47, 8, ma, lutetian, 47, 8, ma, to, 41, 2, ma, bartonian, 41, 2, ma, to, 37, 71, ma, and, priabonian, 37, 71, ma, to, 33, 9, ma, the, gssp, for, the, base, of, the, eocene, is, at, dababiya, near, luxor, egypt, and, is, marked, by, the, start, of, a, significant, variation, in, global, carbon, isotope, ratios, produced, by, a, major, period, of, global, warming, the, change, in, climate, was, due, to, a, rapid, release, of, frozen, methane, clathrates, from, seafloor, sediments, at, the, beginning, of, the, paleocene, eocene, thermal, maximum, petm, the, oligocene, is, the, third, and, youngest, series, epoch, of, the, paleogene, and, lasted, from, 33, 9, ma, to, 23, 03, ma, it, is, divided, into, two, stages, the, rupelian, 33, 9, ma, to, 27, 82, ma, and, chattian, 27, 82, 23, 03, ma, the, gssp, for, the, base, of, the, oligocene, is, at, massignano, near, ancona, italy, the, extinction, the, hantkeninid, planktonic, foraminifera, is, the, key, marker, for, the, eocene, oligocene, boundary, which, was, a, time, of, climate, cooling, that, led, to, widespread, changes, in, fauna, and, flora, the, final, stages, of, the, breakup, of, pangaea, occurred, during, the, paleogene, as, atlantic, ocean, rifting, and, seafloor, spreading, extended, northwards, separating, the, north, america, and, eurasian, plates, and, australia, and, south, america, rifted, from, antarctica, opening, the, southern, ocean, africa, and, india, collided, with, eurasia, forming, the, alpine, himalayan, mountain, chains, and, the, western, margin, of, the, pacific, plate, changed, from, a, divergent, to, convergent, plate, boundary, the, alpine, orogeny, developed, in, response, to, the, collision, between, the, african, and, eurasian, plates, during, the, closing, of, the, neotethys, ocean, and, the, opening, of, the, central, atlantic, ocean, the, result, was, a, series, of, arcuate, mountain, ranges, from, the, tell, rif, betic, cordillera, in, the, western, mediterranean, through, the, alps, carpathians, apennines, dinarides, and, hellenides, to, the, taurides, in, the, east, from, the, late, cretaceous, into, the, early, paleocene, africa, began, to, converge, with, eurasia, the, irregular, outlines, of, the, continental, margins, including, the, adriatic, promontory, adria, that, extended, north, from, the, african, plate, led, to, the, development, of, several, short, subduction, zones, rather, than, one, long, system, in, the, western, mediterranean, the, european, plate, was, subducted, southwards, beneath, the, african, plate, whilst, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, africa, was, subducted, beneath, eurasia, along, a, northward, dipping, subduction, zone, convergence, between, the, iberian, and, european, plates, led, to, the, pyrenean, orogeny, and, as, adria, pushed, northwards, the, alps, and, carpathian, orogens, began, to, develop, the, collision, of, adria, with, eurasia, in, the, early, palaeocene, was, followed, by, a, c, 10, million, year, pause, in, the, convergence, of, africa, and, eurasia, connected, with, the, onset, of, the, opening, of, the, north, atlantic, ocean, as, greenland, rifted, from, the, eurasian, plate, in, the, palaeocene, convergence, rates, between, africa, and, eurasia, increased, again, in, the, early, eocene, and, the, remaining, oceanic, basins, between, adria, and, europe, closed, between, about, 40, and, 30, ma, subduction, began, along, the, western, mediterranean, arc, of, the, tell, rif, betic, and, apennine, mountain, chains, the, rate, of, convergence, was, less, than, the, subduction, rate, of, the, dense, lithosphere, of, the, western, mediterranean, and, roll, back, of, the, subducting, slab, led, to, the, arcuate, structure, of, these, mountain, ranges, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, c, 35, ma, the, anatolide, tauride, platform, northern, part, of, adria, began, to, enter, the, trench, leading, to, the, development, of, the, dinarides, hellenides, and, tauride, mountain, chains, as, the, passive, margin, sediments, of, adria, were, scrapped, off, onto, the, eurasia, crust, during, subduction, the, zagros, mountain, belt, stretches, for, c, 2000, km, from, the, eastern, border, of, iraq, to, the, makran, coast, in, southern, iran, it, formed, as, a, result, of, the, convergence, and, collision, of, the, arabian, and, eurasian, plates, as, the, neotethys, ocean, closed, and, is, composed, sediments, scrapped, from, the, descending, arabian, plate, from, the, late, cretaceous, a, volcanic, arc, developed, on, the, eurasia, margin, as, the, neotethys, crust, was, subducted, beneath, it, a, separate, intra, oceanic, subduction, zone, in, the, neotethys, resulted, in, the, obuction, of, ocean, crust, onto, the, arabian, margin, in, the, late, cretaceous, to, paleocene, with, break, off, of, the, subducted, oceanic, plate, close, to, the, arabian, margin, occurring, during, the, eocene, continental, collision, began, during, the, eocene, c, 35, ma, and, continued, into, the, oligocene, to, c, 26, ma, the, indian, continent, rifted, from, madagascar, at, c, 83, ma, and, drifted, rapidly, c, 18, cm, yr, in, the, paleocene, northwards, towards, the, southern, margin, of, eurasia, a, rapid, decrease, in, velocity, to, c, 5, cm, yr, in, the, early, eocene, records, the, collision, of, the, tethyan, tibetan, himalayas, the, leading, edge, of, greater, india, with, the, lhasa, terrane, of, tibet, southern, eurasian, margin, along, the, indus, yarling, zangbo, suture, zone, to, the, south, of, this, zone, the, himalaya, are, composed, of, metasedimentary, rocks, scraped, off, the, now, subducted, indian, continental, crust, and, mantle, lithosphere, as, the, collision, progressed, palaeomagnetic, data, place, the, present, day, indian, continent, further, south, at, the, time, of, collision, and, decrease, in, plate, velocity, indicating, the, presence, of, a, large, region, to, the, north, of, india, that, has, now, been, subducted, beneath, the, eurasian, plate, or, incorporated, into, the, mountain, belt, this, region, known, as, greater, india, formed, by, extension, along, the, northern, margin, of, india, during, the, opening, of, the, neotethys, the, tethyan, himalaya, block, lay, along, its, northern, edge, with, the, neotethys, ocean, lying, between, it, and, southern, eurasia, debate, about, the, amount, of, deformation, seen, in, the, geological, record, in, the, india, eurasia, collision, zone, versus, the, size, of, greater, india, the, timing, and, nature, of, the, collision, relative, to, the, decrease, in, plate, velocity, and, explanations, for, the, unusually, high, velocity, of, the, indian, plate, have, led, to, several, models, for, greater, india, 1, a, late, cretaceous, to, early, paleocene, subduction, zone, may, have, lain, between, india, and, eurasia, in, the, neotethys, dividing, the, region, into, two, plates, subduction, was, followed, by, collision, of, india, with, eurasia, in, the, middle, eocene, in, this, model, greater, india, would, have, been, less, than, 900, km, wide, 2, greater, india, may, have, formed, a, single, plate, several, thousand, kilometres, wide, with, the, tethyan, himalaya, microcontinent, separated, from, the, indian, continent, by, an, oceanic, basin, the, microcontinent, collided, with, southern, eurasia, c, 58, ma, late, paleocene, whilst, the, velocity, of, the, plate, did, not, decrease, until, c, 50, ma, when, subduction, rates, dropped, as, young, oceanic, crust, entered, the, subduction, zone, 3, this, model, assigns, older, dates, to, parts, of, greater, india, which, changes, its, paleogeographic, position, relative, to, eurasia, and, creates, a, greater, india, formed, of, extended, continental, crust, 2000, 3000, km, wide, the, alpine, himalayan, orogenic, belt, in, southeast, asia, extends, from, the, himalayas, in, india, through, myanmar, west, burma, block, sumatra, java, to, west, sulawesi, during, the, late, cretaceous, to, paleogene, the, northward, movement, of, the, indian, plate, led, to, the, highly, oblique, subduction, of, the, neotethys, along, the, edge, of, the, west, burma, block, and, the, development, of, a, major, north, south, transform, fault, along, the, margin, of, southeast, asia, to, the, south, between, c, 60, and, 50, ma, the, leading, northeastern, edge, of, greater, india, collided, with, the, west, burma, block, resulting, in, deformation, and, metamorphism, during, the, middle, eocene, north, dipping, subduction, resumed, along, the, southern, edge, of, southeast, asia, from, west, sumatra, to, west, sulawesi, as, the, australian, plate, drifted, slowly, northwards, collision, between, india, and, the, west, burma, block, was, complete, by, the, late, oligocene, as, the, india, eurasia, collision, continued, movement, of, material, away, from, the, collision, zone, was, accommodated, along, and, extended, the, already, existing, major, strike, slip, systems, of, the, region, during, the, paleocene, seafloor, spreading, along, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, propagated, from, the, central, atlantic, northwards, between, north, america, and, greenland, in, the, labrador, sea, c, 62, ma, and, baffin, bay, c, 57, ma, and, by, the, early, eocene, c, 54, ma, into, the, northeastern, atlantic, between, greenland, and, eurasia, extension, between, north, america, and, eurasia, also, in, the, early, eocene, led, to, the, opening, of, the, eurasian, basin, across, the, arctic, which, was, linked, to, the, baffin, bay, ridge, and, mid, atlantic, ridge, to, the, south, via, major, strike, slip, faults, from, the, eocene, and, into, the, early, oligocene, greenland, acted, as, an, independent, plate, moving, northwards, and, rotating, anticlockwise, this, led, to, compression, across, the, canadian, arctic, archipelago, svalbard, and, northern, greenland, resulting, in, the, eureka, orogeny, from, c, 47, ma, the, eastern, margin, of, greenland, was, cut, by, the, reykjanes, ridge, the, northeastern, branch, of, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, propagating, northwards, and, splitting, off, the, jan, mayen, microcontinent, after, c, 33, ma, seafloor, spreading, in, labrador, sea, and, baffin, bay, gradually, ceased, and, seafloor, spreading, focused, along, the, northeast, atlantic, by, the, late, oligocene, the, plate, boundary, between, north, america, and, eurasia, was, established, along, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, with, greenland, attached, to, the, north, american, plate, again, and, the, jan, mayen, microcontinent, part, of, the, eurasian, plate, where, its, remains, now, lie, to, the, east, and, possibly, beneath, the, southeast, of, iceland, the, north, atlantic, igneous, province, stretches, across, the, greenland, and, northwest, european, margins, and, is, associated, with, the, proto, icelandic, mantle, plume, which, rose, beneath, the, greenland, lithosphere, at, c, 65, ma, there, were, two, main, phases, of, volcanic, activity, with, peaks, at, c, 60, ma, and, c, 55, ma, magmatism, in, the, british, and, northwest, atlantic, volcanic, provinces, occurred, mainly, in, the, early, palaeocene, the, latter, associated, with, an, increased, spreading, rate, in, the, labrador, sea, whilst, northeast, atlantic, magmatism, occurred, mainly, during, the, early, eocene, and, is, associated, with, a, change, in, the, spreading, direction, in, the, labrador, sea, and, the, northward, drift, of, greenland, the, locations, of, the, magmatism, coincide, with, the, intersection, of, propagating, the, rifts, and, large, scale, pre, existing, lithospheric, structures, which, acted, as, channels, to, the, surface, for, the, magma, the, arrival, of, the, proto, iceland, plume, has, been, considered, the, driving, mechanism, for, rifting, in, the, north, atlantic, however, that, rifting, and, initial, seafloor, spreading, occurred, prior, to, the, arrival, of, the, plume, large, scale, magmatism, occurred, at, a, distance, to, rifting, and, that, rifting, propagated, towards, rather, than, away, from, the, plume, has, led, to, the, suggestion, the, plume, and, associated, magmatism, may, have, been, a, result, rather, than, a, cause, of, the, plate, tectonic, forces, that, led, to, the, propagation, of, rifting, from, the, central, to, the, north, atlantic, mountain, building, continued, along, the, north, america, cordillera, in, response, to, subduction, of, the, farallon, plate, beneath, the, north, american, plate, along, the, central, section, of, the, north, american, margin, crustal, shortening, of, the, cretaceous, to, paleocene, sevier, orogen, lessened, and, deformation, moved, eastward, the, decreasing, dip, of, the, subducting, farallon, plate, led, to, a, flat, slab, segment, that, increased, friction, between, this, and, the, base, of, the, north, american, plate, the, resulting, laramide, orogeny, which, began, the, development, of, the, rocky, mountains, was, a, broad, zone, of, thick, skinned, deformation, with, faults, extending, to, mid, crustal, depths, and, the, uplift, of, basement, rocks, that, lay, to, the, east, of, the, sevier, belt, and, more, than, 700km, from, the, trench, with, the, laramide, uplift, the, western, interior, seaway, was, divided, and, then, retreated, during, the, mid, to, late, eocene, 50, 35, ma, plate, convergence, rates, decreased, and, the, dip, of, the, farallon, slab, began, to, steepen, uplift, ceased, and, the, region, largely, levelled, by, erosion, by, the, oligocene, convergence, gave, way, to, extension, rifting, and, widespread, volcanism, across, the, laramide, belt, ocean, continent, convergence, accommodated, by, east, dipping, subduction, zone, of, the, farallon, plate, beneath, the, western, edge, of, south, america, continued, from, the, mesozoic, over, the, paleogene, changes, in, plate, motion, and, episodes, of, regional, slab, shallowing, and, steepening, resulted, in, variations, in, the, magnitude, of, crustal, shortening, and, amounts, of, magmatism, along, the, length, of, the, andes, in, the, northern, andes, an, oceanic, plateau, with, volcanic, arc, was, accreted, during, the, latest, cretaceous, and, paleocene, whilst, the, central, andes, were, dominated, by, the, subduction, of, oceanic, crust, and, the, southern, andes, were, impacted, by, the, subduction, of, the, farallon, east, antarctic, ocean, ridge, the, caribbean, plate, is, largely, composed, of, oceanic, crust, of, the, caribbean, large, igneous, province, that, formed, during, the, late, cretaceous, during, the, late, cretaceous, to, paleocene, subduction, of, atlantic, crust, was, established, along, its, northern, margin, whilst, to, the, southwest, an, island, arc, collided, with, the, northern, andes, forming, an, east, dipping, subduction, zone, where, caribbean, lithosphere, was, subducted, beneath, the, south, american, margin, during, the, eocene, c, 45, ma, subduction, of, the, farallon, plate, along, the, central, american, subduction, zone, was, re, established, subduction, along, the, northern, section, of, the, caribbean, volcanic, arc, ceased, as, the, bahamas, carbonate, platform, collided, with, cuba, and, was, replaced, by, strike, slip, movements, as, a, transform, fault, extending, from, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, connected, with, the, northern, boundary, of, the, caribbean, plate, subduction, now, focused, along, the, southern, caribbean, arc, lesser, antilles, by, the, oligocene, the, intra, oceanic, central, american, volcanic, arc, began, to, collide, with, northwestern, south, american, at, the, beginning, of, the, paleogene, the, pacific, ocean, consisted, of, the, pacific, farallon, kula, and, izanagi, plates, the, central, pacific, plate, grew, by, seafloor, spreading, as, the, other, three, plates, were, subducted, and, broken, up, in, the, southern, pacific, seafloor, spreading, continued, from, the, late, cretaceous, across, the, pacific, antarctic, pacific, farallon, and, farallon, antarctic, mid, ocean, ridges, the, izanagi, pacific, spreading, ridge, lay, nearly, parallel, to, the, east, asian, subduction, zone, and, between, 60, 50, ma, the, spreading, ridge, began, to, be, subducted, by, c, 50, ma, the, pacific, plate, was, no, longer, surrounded, by, spreading, ridges, but, had, a, subduction, zone, along, its, western, edge, this, changed, the, forces, acting, on, the, pacific, plate, and, led, to, a, major, reorganisation, of, plate, motions, across, the, entire, pacific, region, the, resulting, changes, in, stress, between, the, pacific, and, philippine, sea, plates, initiated, subduction, along, the, izu, bonin, mariana, and, tonga, kermadec, arcs, subduction, of, the, farallon, plate, beneath, the, american, plates, continued, from, the, late, cretaceous, the, kula, farallon, spreading, ridge, lay, to, its, north, until, the, eocene, c, 55, ma, when, the, northern, section, of, the, plate, split, forming, the, vancouver, juan, de, fuca, plate, in, the, oligocene, c, 28, ma, the, first, segment, of, the, pacific, farallon, spreading, ridge, entered, the, north, american, subduction, zone, near, baja, california, leading, to, major, strike, slip, movements, and, the, formation, of, the, san, andreas, fault, at, the, paleogene, neogene, boundary, spreading, ceased, between, the, pacific, and, farallon, plates, and, the, farallon, plate, split, again, forming, the, present, date, nazca, and, cocos, plates, the, kula, plate, lay, between, pacific, plate, and, north, america, to, the, north, and, northwest, it, was, being, subducted, beneath, the, aleutian, trench, spreading, between, the, kula, and, pacific, and, farallon, plates, ceased, c, 40, ma, and, the, kula, plate, became, part, of, the, pacific, plate, the, hawaiian, emperor, seamount, chain, formed, above, the, hawaiian, hotspot, originally, thought, to, be, stationary, within, the, mantle, the, hotspot, is, now, considered, to, have, drifted, south, during, the, paleocene, to, early, eocene, as, the, pacific, plate, moved, north, at, c, 47, ma, movement, of, the, hotspot, ceased, and, the, pacific, plate, motion, changed, from, northward, to, northwestward, in, response, to, the, onset, of, subduction, along, its, western, margin, this, resulted, in, a, 60, degree, bend, in, the, seamount, chain, other, seamount, chains, related, to, hotspots, in, the, south, pacific, show, a, similar, change, in, orientation, at, this, time, slow, seafloor, spreading, continued, between, australia, and, east, antarctica, shallow, water, channels, probably, developed, south, of, tasmania, opening, the, tasmanian, passage, in, the, eocene, and, deep, ocean, routes, opening, from, the, mid, oligocene, rifting, between, the, antarctic, peninsula, and, the, southern, tip, of, south, america, formed, the, drake, passage, and, opened, the, southern, ocean, also, during, this, time, completing, the, breakup, of, gondwana, the, opening, of, these, passages, and, the, creation, of, the, southern, ocean, established, the, antarctic, circumpolar, current, glaciers, began, to, build, across, the, antarctica, continent, that, now, lay, isolated, in, the, south, polar, region, and, surrounded, by, cold, ocean, waters, these, changes, contributed, to, the, fall, in, global, temperatures, and, the, beginning, of, icehouse, conditions, extensional, stresses, from, the, subduction, zone, along, the, northern, neotethys, resulted, in, rifting, between, africa, and, arabia, forming, the, gulf, of, aden, in, the, late, eocene, to, the, west, in, the, early, oligocene, flood, basalts, erupted, across, ethiopia, northeast, sudan, and, southwest, yemen, as, the, afar, mantle, plume, began, to, impact, the, base, of, the, african, lithosphere, rifting, across, the, southern, red, sea, began, in, the, mid, oligocene, and, across, the, central, and, northern, red, sea, regions, in, the, late, oligocene, and, early, miocene, climatic, conditions, varied, considerably, during, the, paleogene, after, the, disruption, of, the, chicxulub, impact, settled, a, period, of, cool, and, dry, conditions, continued, from, the, late, cretaceous, at, the, paleocene, eocene, boundary, global, temperatures, rose, rapidly, with, the, onset, of, the, paleocene, eocene, thermal, maximum, petm, by, the, middle, eocene, temperatures, began, to, drop, again, and, by, the, late, eocene, c, 37, ma, had, decreased, sufficiently, for, ice, sheets, to, form, in, antarctica, the, global, climate, entered, icehouse, conditions, at, the, eocene, oligocene, boundary, and, the, present, day, late, cenozoic, ice, age, began, the, paleogene, began, with, the, brief, but, intense, impact, winter, caused, by, the, chicxulub, impact, which, was, followed, by, an, abrupt, period, of, warming, after, temperatures, stabilised, the, steady, cooling, and, drying, of, the, late, cretaceous, early, paleogene, cool, interval, that, had, spanned, the, last, two, ages, of, the, late, cretaceous, continued, with, only, the, brief, interruption, of, the, latest, danian, event, c, 62, 2, ma, when, global, temperatures, rose, there, is, no, evidence, for, ice, sheets, at, the, poles, during, the, paleocene, the, relatively, cool, conditions, were, brought, to, an, end, by, the, thanetian, thermal, event, and, the, beginning, of, the, petm, this, was, one, of, the, warmest, times, of, the, phanerozoic, eon, during, which, global, mean, surface, temperatures, increased, to, 31, 6, c, according, to, a, study, published, in, 2018, from, about, 56, to, 48, ma, annual, air, temperatures, over, land, and, at, mid, latitude, averaged, about, 23, 29, c, 4, 7, c, for, comparison, this, was, 10, to, 15, c, higher, than, the, current, annual, mean, temperatures, in, these, areas, this, rapid, rise, in, global, temperatures, and, intense, greenhouse, conditions, were, due, to, a, sudden, increase, in, levels, of, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, and, other, greenhouse, gases, an, accompanying, rise, in, humidity, is, reflected, in, an, increase, in, kaolinite, in, sediments, which, forms, by, chemical, weathering, in, hot, humid, conditions, tropical, and, subtropical, forests, flourished, and, extended, into, polar, regions, water, vapour, a, greenhouse, gas, associated, with, these, forests, also, contributed, to, the, greenhouse, conditions, the, initial, rise, in, global, temperatures, was, related, to, the, intrusion, of, magmatic, sills, into, organic, rich, sediments, during, volcanic, activity, in, the, north, atlantic, igneous, province, between, about, 56, and, 54, ma, which, rapidly, released, large, amounts, of, greenhouse, gases, into, the, atmosphere, this, warming, led, to, melting, of, frozen, methane, hydrates, on, continental, slopes, adding, further, greenhouses, gases, it, also, reduced, the, rate, of, burial, of, organic, matter, as, higher, temperatures, accelerated, the, rate, of, bacterial, decomposition, which, released, co, 2, back, into, the, oceans, the, relatively, sudden, climatic, changes, associated, with, the, petm, resulted, in, the, extinction, of, some, groups, of, fauna, and, flora, and, the, rise, of, others, for, example, with, the, warming, of, the, arctic, ocean, around, 70, of, deep, sea, foraminifera, species, went, extinct, whilst, on, land, many, modern, mammals, including, primates, appeared, fluctuating, sea, levels, meant, during, low, stands, a, land, bridge, formed, across, the, bering, straits, between, north, america, and, eurasia, allowing, the, movement, of, land, animals, between, the, two, continents, the, petm, was, followed, by, the, less, severe, eocene, thermal, maximum, 2, c, 53, 69, ma, and, the, eocene, thermal, maximum, 3, c, 53, ma, the, early, eocene, warm, conditions, were, brought, to, an, end, by, the, azolla, event, this, change, of, climate, at, about, 48, 5, ma, is, believed, to, have, been, caused, by, a, proliferation, of, aquatic, ferns, from, the, genus, azolla, resulting, in, the, sequestering, of, large, amounts, of, co, 2, from, the, atmosphere, by, the, plants, from, this, time, until, about, 34, ma, there, was, a, slow, cooling, trend, known, as, the, middle, late, eocene, cooling, as, temperatures, dropped, at, high, latitudes, the, presence, of, cold, water, diatoms, suggests, sea, ice, was, able, to, form, in, winter, in, the, arctic, ocean, and, by, the, late, eocene, c, 37, ma, there, is, evidence, of, glaciation, in, antarctica, changes, in, deep, ocean, currents, as, australia, and, south, america, moved, away, from, antarctica, opening, the, drake, and, tasmanian, passages, were, responsible, for, the, drop, in, global, temperatures, the, warm, waters, of, the, south, atlantic, indian, and, south, pacific, oceans, extended, southward, into, the, opening, southern, ocean, and, became, part, of, the, cold, circumpolar, current, dense, polar, waters, sank, into, the, deep, oceans, and, moved, northwards, reducing, global, ocean, temperatures, this, cooling, may, have, occurred, over, less, than, 100, 000, years, and, resulted, in, a, widespread, extinction, in, marine, life, by, the, eocene, oligocene, boundary, sediments, deposited, in, the, ocean, from, glaciers, indicate, the, presence, of, an, ice, sheet, in, western, antarctica, that, extended, to, the, ocean, the, development, of, the, circumpolar, current, led, to, changes, in, the, oceans, which, in, turn, reduced, atmospheric, co, 2, further, increasing, upwellings, of, cold, water, stimulated, the, productivity, of, phytoplankton, and, the, cooler, waters, reduced, the, rate, of, bacterial, decay, of, organic, matter, and, promoted, the, growth, of, methane, hydrates, in, marine, sediments, this, created, a, positive, feedback, cycle, where, global, cooling, reduced, atmospheric, co, 2, and, this, reduction, in, co, 2, lead, to, changes, which, further, lowered, global, temperatures, the, decrease, in, evaporation, from, the, cooler, oceans, also, reduced, moisture, in, the, atmosphere, and, increased, aridity, by, the, early, oligocene, the, north, american, and, eurasian, tropical, and, subtropical, forests, were, replaced, by, dry, woodlands, and, widespread, grasslands, the, early, oligocene, glacial, maximum, lasted, for, about, 200, 000, years, and, the, global, mean, surface, temperature, continued, to, decrease, gradually, during, the, rupelian, a, drop, in, global, sea, levels, during, the, mid, oligocene, indicates, major, growth, of, the, antarctic, glacial, ice, sheet, in, the, late, oligocene, global, temperatures, began, to, warm, slightly, though, they, continued, to, be, significantly, lower, than, during, the, previous, epochs, of, the, paleogene, and, polar, ice, remained, tropical, taxa, diversified, faster, than, those, at, higher, latitudes, after, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, resulting, in, the, development, of, a, significant, latitudinal, diversity, gradient, mammals, began, a, rapid, diversification, during, this, period, after, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, which, saw, the, demise, of, the, non, avian, dinosaurs, mammals, began, to, evolve, from, a, few, small, and, generalized, forms, into, most, of, the, modern, varieties, we, see, presently, some, of, these, mammals, evolved, into, large, forms, that, dominated, the, land, while, others, became, capable, of, living, in, marine, specialized, terrestrial, and, airborne, environments, those, that, adapted, to, the, oceans, became, modern, cetaceans, while, those, that, adapted, to, trees, became, primates, the, group, to, which, humans, belong, birds, extant, dinosaurs, which, were, already, well, established, by, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, also, experienced, adaptive, radiation, as, they, took, over, the, skies, left, empty, by, the, now, extinct, pterosaurs, some, flightless, birds, such, as, penguins, ratites, and, terror, birds, also, filled, niches, left, by, the, hesperornithes, and, other, extinct, dinosaurs, pronounced, cooling, in, the, oligocene, resulted, in, a, massive, floral, shift, and, many, extant, modern, plants, arose, during, this, time, grasses, and, herbs, such, as, artemisia, began, to, proliferate, at, the, expense, of, tropical, plants, which, began, to, decrease, conifer, forests, developed, in, mountainous, areas, this, cooling, trend, continued, with, major, fluctuation, until, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, period, this, evidence, for, this, floral, shift, is, found, in, the, palynological, record
