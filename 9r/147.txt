the, local, supercluster, lsc, or, ls, is, a, defined, supercluster, containing, the, virgo, cluster, and, local, group, which, itself, contains, the, milky, way, and, andromeda, galaxies, as, well, as, others, at, least, 100, galaxy, groups, and, clusters, are, located, within, its, diameter, of, 33, megaparsecs, 110, million, light, years, the, virgo, sc, is, one, of, about, 10, million, superclusters, in, the, observable, universe, and, is, in, the, pisces, cetus, supercluster, complex, a, galaxy, filament, a, 2014, study, indicates, that, the, local, supercluster, is, only, a, part, of, an, even, greater, supercluster, laniakea, a, larger, centered, on, the, great, attractor, thus, subsuming, the, former, virgo, supercluster, under, laniakea, beginning, with, the, first, large, sample, of, nebulae, published, by, william, and, john, herschel, in, 1863, it, was, known, that, there, is, a, marked, excess, of, nebular, fields, in, the, constellation, virgo, near, the, north, galactic, pole, in, the, 1950s, french, american, astronomer, g, rard, de, vaucouleurs, was, the, first, to, argue, that, this, excess, represented, a, large, scale, galaxy, like, structure, coining, the, term, local, supergalaxy, in, 1953, which, he, changed, to, local, supercluster, lsc, in, 1958, harlow, shapley, in, his, 1959, book, of, stars, and, men, suggested, the, term, metagalaxy, debate, went, on, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, as, to, whether, the, local, supercluster, ls, was, actually, a, structure, or, a, chance, alignment, of, galaxies, the, issue, was, resolved, with, the, large, redshift, surveys, of, the, late, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, which, convincingly, showed, the, flattened, concentration, of, galaxies, along, the, supergalactic, plane, in, a, comprehensive, 1982, paper, r, brent, tully, presented, the, conclusions, of, his, research, concerning, the, basic, structure, of, the, ls, it, consists, of, two, components, an, appreciably, flattened, disk, containing, two, thirds, of, the, supercluster, s, luminous, galaxies, and, a, roughly, spherical, halo, containing, the, remaining, third, the, disk, itself, is, a, thin, 1, mpc, ellipsoid, with, a, long, axis, short, axis, ratio, of, at, least, 6, to, 1, and, possibly, as, high, as, 9, to, 1, data, released, in, june, 2003, from, the, 5, year, two, degree, field, galaxy, redshift, survey, 2df, has, allowed, astronomers, to, compare, the, ls, to, other, superclusters, the, ls, represents, a, typical, poor, that, is, lacking, a, high, density, core, supercluster, of, rather, small, size, it, has, one, rich, galaxy, cluster, in, the, center, surrounded, by, filaments, of, galaxies, and, poor, groups, the, local, group, is, located, on, the, outskirts, of, the, ls, in, a, small, filament, extending, from, the, fornax, cluster, to, the, virgo, cluster, the, virgo, supercluster, s, volume, is, roughly, 7, 000, times, that, of, the, local, group, or, 100, billion, times, that, of, the, milky, way, the, number, density, of, galaxies, in, the, ls, falls, off, with, the, square, of, the, distance, from, its, center, near, the, virgo, cluster, suggesting, that, this, cluster, is, not, randomly, located, overall, the, vast, majority, of, the, luminous, galaxies, less, than, absolute, magnitude, 13, are, concentrated, in, a, small, number, of, clouds, groups, of, galaxy, clusters, ninety, eight, percent, can, be, found, in, the, following, 11, clouds, given, in, decreasing, order, of, number, of, luminous, galaxies, canes, venatici, virgo, cluster, virgo, ii, southern, extension, leo, ii, virgo, iii, crater, ngc, 3672, leo, i, leo, minor, ngc, 2841, draco, ngc, 5907, antlia, ngc, 2997, and, ngc, 5643, of, the, luminous, galaxies, located, in, the, disk, one, third, are, in, the, virgo, cluster, the, remainder, are, found, in, the, canes, venatici, cloud, and, virgo, ii, cloud, plus, the, somewhat, insignificant, ngc, 5643, group, the, luminous, galaxies, in, the, halo, are, concentrated, in, a, small, number, of, clouds, 94, in, 7, clouds, this, distribution, indicates, that, most, of, the, volume, of, the, supergalactic, plane, is, a, great, void, a, helpful, analogy, that, matches, the, observed, distribution, is, that, of, soap, bubbles, flattish, clusters, and, superclusters, are, found, at, the, intersection, of, bubbles, which, are, large, roughly, spherical, on, the, order, of, 20, 60, mpc, in, diameter, voids, in, space, long, filamentary, structures, seem, to, predominate, an, example, of, this, is, the, hydra, centaurus, supercluster, the, nearest, supercluster, to, the, virgo, supercluster, which, starts, at, a, distance, of, roughly, 30, mpc, and, extends, to, 60, mpc, since, the, late, 1980s, it, has, been, apparent, that, not, only, the, local, group, but, all, matter, out, to, a, distance, of, at, least, 50, mpc, is, experiencing, a, bulk, flow, on, the, order, of, 600, km, s, in, the, direction, of, the, norma, cluster, abell, 3627, lynden, bell, et, al, 1988, dubbed, the, cause, of, this, the, great, attractor, the, great, attractor, is, now, understood, to, be, the, center, of, mass, of, an, even, larger, structure, of, galaxy, clusters, dubbed, laniakea, which, includes, the, virgo, supercluster, including, the, local, group, as, well, as, the, hydra, centaurus, supercluster, the, pavo, indus, supercluster, and, the, fornax, group, the, great, attractor, together, with, the, entire, supercluster, is, found, to, be, moving, toward, shapley, supercluster, with, center, of, shapley, attractor, the, ls, has, a, total, mass, m, 10, 15, m, and, a, total, optical, luminosity, l, 3, 10, 12, l, this, yields, a, mass, to, light, ratio, of, about, 300, times, that, of, the, solar, ratio, m, l, 1, a, figure, that, is, consistent, with, results, obtained, for, other, superclusters, by, comparison, the, mass, to, light, ratio, for, the, milky, way, is, 63, 8, assuming, a, solar, absolute, magnitude, of, 4, 83, a, milky, way, absolute, magnitude, of, 20, 9, and, a, milky, way, mass, of, 1, 25, 10, 12, m, these, ratios, are, one, of, the, main, arguments, in, favor, of, the, presence, of, large, amounts, of, dark, matter, in, the, universe, if, dark, matter, did, not, exist, much, smaller, mass, to, light, ratios, would, be, expected
