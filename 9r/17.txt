the, metric, system, is, a, decimal, based, system, of, measurement, the, current, international, standard, for, the, metric, system, is, the, international, system, of, units, syst, me, international, d, unit, s, or, si, in, which, all, units, can, be, expressed, in, terms, of, seven, base, units, the, metre, m, kilogram, kg, second, s, ampere, a, kelvin, k, mole, mol, and, candela, cd, these, can, be, made, into, larger, or, smaller, units, with, the, use, of, metric, prefixes, si, derived, units, are, named, combinations, such, as, the, hertz, cycles, per, second, newton, kg, m, s, 2, and, tesla, 1, kg, s, 2, a, 1, or, a, shifted, scale, in, the, case, of, degrees, celsius, certain, units, have, been, officially, accepted, for, use, with, the, si, some, of, these, are, decimalised, like, the, litre, and, electronvolt, and, are, considered, metric, others, like, the, astronomical, unit, are, not, ancient, non, metric, but, si, accepted, multiples, of, time, minute, and, hour, and, angle, degree, arcminute, and, arcsecond, are, sexagesimal, base, 60, the, metric, system, has, been, formulated, in, a, number, of, different, ways, over, the, centuries, the, si, system, originally, derived, its, terminology, from, the, metre, kilogram, second, system, of, units, though, the, definitions, of, the, fundamental, si, units, have, been, changed, to, depend, only, on, constants, of, nature, other, metric, system, variants, include, the, centimetre, gram, second, system, of, units, the, metre, tonne, second, system, of, units, and, the, gravitational, metric, system, each, of, these, has, some, unique, named, units, in, addition, to, unaffiliated, metric, units, and, some, are, still, in, use, in, certain, fields, in, the, metric, system, multiples, and, submultiples, of, units, follow, a, decimal, pattern, a, common, set, of, decimal, based, prefixes, that, have, the, effect, of, multiplication, or, division, by, an, integer, power, of, ten, can, be, applied, to, units, that, are, themselves, too, large, or, too, small, for, practical, use, the, prefix, kilo, for, example, is, used, to, multiply, the, unit, by, 1000, and, the, prefix, milli, is, to, indicate, a, one, thousandth, part, of, the, unit, thus, the, kilogram, and, kilometre, are, a, thousand, grams, and, metres, respectively, and, a, milligram, and, millimetre, are, one, thousandth, of, a, gram, and, metre, respectively, these, relations, can, be, written, symbolically, as, the, decimalised, system, is, based, on, the, metre, which, had, been, introduced, in, france, in, the, 1790s, the, historical, development, of, these, systems, culminated, in, the, definition, of, the, international, system, of, units, si, in, the, mid, 20th, century, under, the, oversight, of, an, international, standards, body, adopting, the, metric, system, is, known, as, metrication, the, historical, evolution, of, metric, systems, has, resulted, in, the, recognition, of, several, principles, a, set, of, independent, dimensions, of, nature, is, selected, in, terms, of, which, all, natural, quantities, can, be, expressed, called, base, quantities, for, each, of, these, dimensions, a, representative, quantity, is, defined, as, a, base, unit, of, measure, the, definition, of, base, units, has, increasingly, been, realised, in, terms, of, fundamental, natural, phenomena, in, preference, to, copies, of, physical, artefacts, a, unit, derived, from, the, base, units, is, used, for, expressing, quantities, of, dimensions, that, can, be, derived, from, the, base, dimensions, of, the, system, e, g, the, square, metre, is, the, derived, unit, for, area, which, is, derived, from, length, these, derived, units, are, coherent, which, means, that, they, involve, only, products, of, powers, of, the, base, units, without, any, further, factors, for, any, given, quantity, whose, unit, has, a, name, and, symbol, an, extended, set, of, smaller, and, larger, units, is, defined, that, are, related, by, factors, of, powers, of, ten, the, unit, of, time, should, be, the, second, the, unit, of, length, should, be, either, the, metre, or, a, decimal, multiple, of, it, and, the, unit, of, mass, should, be, the, gram, or, a, decimal, multiple, of, it, metric, systems, have, evolved, since, the, 1790s, as, science, and, technology, have, evolved, in, providing, a, single, universal, measuring, system, before, and, in, addition, to, the, si, other, metric, systems, include, the, mks, system, of, units, and, the, mksa, systems, which, are, the, direct, forerunners, of, the, si, the, centimetre, gram, second, cgs, system, and, its, subtypes, the, cgs, electrostatic, cgs, esu, system, the, cgs, electromagnetic, cgs, emu, system, and, their, still, popular, blend, the, gaussian, system, the, metre, tonne, second, mts, system, and, the, gravitational, metric, systems, which, can, be, based, on, either, the, metre, or, the, centimetre, and, either, the, gram, gram, force, kilogram, or, kilogram, force, the, si, has, been, adopted, as, the, official, system, of, weights, and, measures, by, nearly, all, nations, in, the, world, the, french, revolution, 1789, 99, enabled, france, to, reform, its, many, outdated, system, of, various, local, weights, and, measures, in, 1790, charles, maurice, de, talleyrand, p, rigord, proposed, a, new, system, based, on, natural, units, to, the, french, national, assembly, aiming, for, global, adoption, with, the, united, kingdom, not, responding, to, a, request, to, collaborate, in, the, development, of, the, system, the, french, academy, of, sciences, established, a, commission, to, implement, this, new, standard, alone, and, in, 1799, the, new, system, was, launched, in, france, 145, 149, the, units, of, the, metric, system, originally, taken, from, observable, features, of, nature, are, now, defined, by, seven, physical, constants, being, given, exact, numerical, values, in, terms, of, the, units, in, the, modern, form, of, the, international, system, of, units, si, the, seven, base, units, are, metre, for, length, kilogram, for, mass, second, for, time, ampere, for, electric, current, kelvin, for, temperature, candela, for, luminous, intensity, and, mole, for, amount, of, substance, these, together, with, their, derived, units, can, measure, any, physical, quantity, derived, units, may, have, their, own, unit, name, such, as, the, watt, j, s, and, lux, cd, m, 2, or, may, just, be, expressed, as, combinations, of, base, units, such, as, velocity, m, s, and, acceleration, m, s, 2, the, metric, system, was, designed, to, have, properties, that, make, it, easy, to, use, and, widely, applicable, including, units, based, on, the, natural, world, decimal, ratios, prefixes, for, multiples, and, sub, multiples, and, a, structure, of, base, and, derived, units, it, is, a, coherent, system, derived, units, were, built, up, from, the, base, units, using, logical, rather, than, empirical, relationships, while, multiples, and, submultiples, of, both, base, and, derived, units, were, decimal, based, and, identified, by, a, standard, set, of, prefixes, 15, 18, the, metric, system, is, extensible, and, new, derived, units, are, defined, as, needed, in, fields, such, as, radiology, and, chemistry, for, example, the, katal, a, derived, unit, for, catalytic, activity, equivalent, to, one, mole, per, second, 1, mol, s, was, added, in, 1999, the, base, units, used, in, a, measurement, system, must, be, realisable, each, of, the, definitions, of, the, base, units, in, the, si, is, accompanied, by, a, defined, mise, en, pratique, that, describes, in, detail, at, least, one, way, in, which, the, base, unit, can, be, measured, where, possible, definitions, of, the, base, units, were, developed, so, that, any, laboratory, equipped, with, proper, instruments, would, be, able, to, realise, a, standard, without, reliance, on, an, artefact, held, by, another, country, in, practice, such, realisation, is, done, under, the, auspices, of, a, mutual, acceptance, arrangement, in, 1791, the, commission, originally, defined, the, metre, based, on, the, size, of, the, earth, equal, to, one, ten, millionth, of, the, distance, from, the, equator, to, the, north, pole, in, the, si, the, standard, metre, is, now, defined, as, exactly, 1, 299, 792, 458, of, the, distance, that, light, travels, in, a, second, the, metre, can, be, realised, by, measuring, the, length, that, a, light, wave, travels, in, a, given, time, or, equivalently, by, measuring, the, wavelength, of, light, of, a, known, frequency, the, kilogram, was, originally, defined, as, the, mass, of, one, cubic, decimetre, of, water, at, 4, c, standardised, as, the, mass, of, a, man, made, artefact, of, platinum, iridium, held, in, a, laboratory, in, france, which, was, used, until, a, new, definition, was, introduced, in, may, 2019, replicas, made, in, 1879, at, the, time, of, the, artefact, s, fabrication, and, distributed, to, signatories, of, the, metre, convention, serve, as, de, facto, standards, of, mass, in, those, countries, additional, replicas, have, been, fabricated, since, as, additional, countries, have, joined, the, convention, the, replicas, were, subject, to, periodic, validation, by, comparison, to, the, original, called, the, ipk, it, became, apparent, that, either, the, ipk, or, the, replicas, or, both, were, deteriorating, and, are, no, longer, comparable, they, had, diverged, by, 50, g, since, fabrication, so, figuratively, the, accuracy, of, the, kilogram, was, no, better, than, 5, parts, in, a, hundred, million, or, a, relative, accuracy, of, 5, 10, 8, the, revision, of, the, si, replaced, the, ipk, with, an, exact, definition, of, the, planck, constant, as, expressed, in, si, units, which, defines, the, kilogram, in, terms, of, fundamental, constants, a, base, quantity, is, one, of, a, conventionally, chosen, subset, of, physical, quantities, where, no, quantity, in, the, subset, can, be, expressed, in, terms, of, the, others, a, base, unit, is, a, unit, adopted, for, expressing, a, base, quantity, a, derived, unit, is, used, for, expressing, any, other, quantity, and, is, a, product, of, powers, of, base, units, for, example, in, the, modern, metric, system, length, has, the, unit, metre, and, time, has, the, unit, second, and, speed, has, the, derived, unit, metre, per, second, 15, density, or, mass, per, unit, volume, has, the, unit, kilogram, per, cubic, metre, 434, a, characteristic, feature, of, metric, systems, is, their, reliance, upon, multiples, of, 10, for, example, the, base, unit, of, length, is, the, metre, and, distances, much, longer, or, much, shorter, than, 1, metre, are, measured, in, units, that, are, powers, of, 10, times, a, metre, this, is, unlike, older, systems, of, units, in, which, the, ratio, between, the, units, for, longer, and, shorter, distances, varied, there, are, 12, inches, in, a, foot, but, the, number, of, 5, 280, feet, in, a, mile, is, not, a, power, of, 12, 17, for, many, everyday, applications, the, united, states, has, resisted, the, adoption, of, a, decimal, based, system, continuing, to, use, a, conglomeration, of, basically, incoherent, measurement, systems, in, the, early, days, multipliers, that, were, positive, powers, of, ten, were, given, greek, derived, prefixes, such, as, kilo, and, mega, and, those, that, were, negative, powers, of, ten, were, given, latin, derived, prefixes, such, as, centi, and, milli, however, 1935, extensions, to, the, prefix, system, did, not, follow, this, convention, the, prefixes, nano, and, micro, for, example, have, greek, roots, 222, 223, during, the, 19th, century, the, prefix, myria, derived, from, the, greek, word, m, rioi, was, used, as, a, multiplier, for, 10, 000, when, applying, prefixes, to, derived, units, of, area, and, volume, that, are, expressed, in, terms, of, units, of, length, squared, or, cubed, the, square, and, cube, operators, are, applied, to, the, unit, of, length, including, the, prefix, as, illustrated, below, prefixes, are, not, usually, used, to, indicate, multiples, of, a, second, greater, than, 1, the, non, si, units, of, minute, hour, and, day, are, used, instead, on, the, other, hand, prefixes, are, used, for, multiples, of, the, non, si, unit, of, volume, the, litre, l, l, such, as, millilitres, ml, each, variant, of, the, metric, system, has, a, degree, of, coherence, the, derived, units, are, directly, related, to, the, base, units, without, the, need, for, intermediate, conversion, factors, for, example, in, a, coherent, system, the, units, of, force, energy, and, power, are, chosen, so, that, the, equations, hold, without, the, introduction, of, unit, conversion, factors, once, a, set, of, coherent, units, has, been, defined, other, relationships, in, physics, that, use, this, set, of, units, will, automatically, be, true, therefore, einstein, s, mass, energy, equation, e, mc, 2, does, not, require, extraneous, constants, when, expressed, in, coherent, units, the, cgs, system, had, two, units, of, energy, the, erg, that, was, related, to, mechanics, and, the, calorie, that, was, related, to, thermal, energy, so, only, one, of, them, the, erg, could, bear, a, coherent, relationship, to, the, base, units, coherence, was, a, design, aim, of, si, which, resulted, in, only, one, unit, of, energy, being, defined, the, joule, maxwell, s, equations, of, electromagnetism, contained, a, factor, of, 1, 4, displaystyle, 1, 4, pi, relating, to, steradians, representative, of, the, fact, that, electric, charges, and, magnetic, fields, may, be, considered, to, emanate, from, a, point, and, propagate, equally, in, all, directions, i, e, spherically, this, factor, made, equations, more, awkward, than, necessary, and, so, oliver, heaviside, suggested, adjusting, the, system, of, units, to, remove, it, the, basic, units, of, the, metric, system, as, originally, defined, represented, common, quantities, or, relationships, in, nature, they, still, do, the, modern, precisely, defined, quantities, are, refinements, of, definition, and, methodology, but, still, with, the, same, magnitudes, in, cases, where, laboratory, precision, may, not, be, required, or, available, or, where, approximations, are, good, enough, the, original, definitions, may, suffice, basic, units, metre, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole, and, candela, for, derived, units, such, as, volts, and, watts, see, international, system, of, units, a, number, of, different, metric, system, have, been, developed, all, using, the, m, tre, des, archives, and, kilogramme, des, archives, or, their, descendants, as, their, base, units, but, differing, in, the, definitions, of, the, various, derived, units, in, 1832, gauss, used, the, astronomical, second, as, a, base, unit, in, defining, the, gravitation, of, the, earth, and, together, with, the, milligram, and, millimetre, this, became, the, first, system, of, mechanical, units, he, showed, that, the, strength, of, a, magnet, could, also, be, quantified, in, terms, of, these, units, by, measuring, the, oscillations, of, a, magnetised, needle, and, finding, the, quantity, of, magnetic, fluid, that, produces, an, acceleration, of, one, unit, when, applied, to, a, unit, mass, the, centimetre, gram, second, system, of, units, cgs, was, the, first, coherent, metric, system, having, been, developed, in, the, 1860s, and, promoted, by, maxwell, and, thomson, in, 1874, this, system, was, formally, promoted, by, the, british, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, baas, the, system, s, characteristics, are, that, density, is, expressed, in, g, cm, 3, force, expressed, in, dynes, and, mechanical, energy, in, ergs, thermal, energy, was, defined, in, calories, one, calorie, being, the, energy, required, to, raise, the, temperature, of, one, gram, of, water, from, 15, 5, c, to, 16, 5, c, the, meeting, also, recognised, two, sets, of, units, for, electrical, and, magnetic, properties, the, electrostatic, set, of, units, and, the, electromagnetic, set, of, units, the, cgs, units, of, electricity, were, cumbersome, to, work, with, this, was, remedied, at, the, 1893, international, electrical, congress, held, in, chicago, by, defining, the, international, ampere, and, ohm, using, definitions, based, on, the, metre, kilogram, and, second, in, the, international, system, of, electrical, and, magnetic, units, during, the, same, period, in, which, the, cgs, system, was, being, extended, to, include, electromagnetism, other, systems, were, developed, distinguished, by, their, choice, of, coherent, base, unit, including, the, practical, system, of, electric, units, or, qes, quad, eleventhgram, second, system, was, being, used, here, the, base, units, are, the, quad, equal, to, 10, 7, m, approximately, a, quadrant, of, the, earth, s, circumference, the, eleventhgram, equal, to, 10, 11, g, and, the, second, these, were, chosen, so, that, the, corresponding, electrical, units, of, potential, difference, current, and, resistance, had, a, convenient, magnitude, 268, 17, in, 1901, giovanni, giorgi, showed, that, by, adding, an, electrical, unit, as, a, fourth, base, unit, the, various, anomalies, in, electromagnetic, systems, could, be, resolved, the, metre, kilogram, second, coulomb, mksc, and, metre, kilogram, second, ampere, mksa, systems, are, examples, of, such, systems, the, metre, tonne, second, system, of, units, mts, was, based, on, the, metre, tonne, and, second, the, unit, of, force, was, the, sth, ne, and, the, unit, of, pressure, was, the, pi, ze, it, was, invented, in, france, for, industrial, use, and, from, 1933, to, 1955, was, used, both, in, france, and, in, the, soviet, union, gravitational, metric, systems, use, the, kilogram, force, kilopond, as, a, base, unit, of, force, with, mass, measured, in, a, unit, known, as, the, hyl, technische, masseneinheit, tme, mug, or, metric, slug, although, the, cgpm, passed, a, resolution, in, 1901, defining, the, standard, value, of, acceleration, due, to, gravity, to, be, 980, 665, cm, s, 2, gravitational, units, are, not, part, of, the, international, system, of, units, si, the, international, system, of, units, is, the, modern, metric, system, it, is, based, on, the, metre, kilogram, second, ampere, mksa, system, of, units, from, early, in, the, 20th, century, it, also, includes, numerous, coherent, derived, units, for, common, quantities, like, power, watt, and, irradience, lumen, electrical, units, were, taken, from, the, international, system, then, in, use, other, units, like, those, for, energy, joule, were, modelled, on, those, from, the, older, cgs, system, but, scaled, to, be, coherent, with, mksa, units, two, additional, base, units, the, kelvin, which, is, equivalent, to, degree, celsius, for, change, in, thermodynamic, temperature, but, set, so, that, 0, k, is, absolute, zero, and, the, candela, which, is, roughly, equivalent, to, the, international, candle, unit, of, illumination, were, introduced, later, another, base, unit, the, mole, a, unit, of, amount, of, substance, equivalent, to, the, avogadro, number, number, of, specified, molecules, was, added, along, with, several, other, derived, units, the, system, was, promulgated, by, the, general, conference, on, weights, and, measures, french, conf, rence, g, n, rale, des, poids, et, mesures, cgpm, in, 1960, at, that, time, the, metre, was, redefined, in, terms, of, the, wavelength, of, a, spectral, line, of, the, krypton, 86, atom, krypton, 86, being, a, stable, isotope, of, an, inert, gas, that, occurs, in, undetectable, or, trace, amounts, naturally, and, the, standard, metre, artefact, from, 1889, was, retired, 16, today, the, international, system, of, units, consists, of, 7, base, units, and, innumerable, coherent, derived, units, including, 22, with, special, names, the, last, new, derived, unit, the, katal, for, catalytic, activity, was, added, in, 1999, all, the, base, units, except, the, second, are, now, defined, in, terms, of, exact, and, invariant, constants, of, physics, or, mathematics, barring, those, parts, of, their, definitions, which, are, dependent, on, the, second, itself, as, a, consequence, the, speed, of, light, has, now, become, an, exactly, defined, constant, and, defines, the, metre, as, 1, 299, 792, 458, of, the, distance, light, travels, in, a, second, the, kilogram, was, defined, by, a, cylinder, of, platinum, iridium, alloy, until, a, new, definition, in, terms, of, natural, physical, constants, was, adopted, in, 2019, as, of, 2022, the, range, of, decimal, prefixes, has, been, extended, to, those, for, 10, 30, quetta, and, 10, 30, quecto
