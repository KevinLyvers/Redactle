basalt, uk, b, s, l, t, l, t, us, b, s, l, t, b, e, s, l, t, is, an, aphanitic, fine, grained, extrusive, igneous, rock, formed, from, the, rapid, cooling, of, low, viscosity, lava, rich, in, magnesium, and, iron, mafic, lava, exposed, at, or, very, near, the, surface, of, a, rocky, planet, or, moon, more, than, 90, of, all, volcanic, rock, on, earth, is, basalt, rapid, cooling, fine, grained, basalt, is, chemically, equivalent, to, slow, cooling, coarse, grained, gabbro, the, eruption, of, basalt, lava, is, observed, by, geologists, at, about, 20, volcanoes, per, year, basalt, is, also, an, important, rock, type, on, other, planetary, bodies, in, the, solar, system, for, example, the, bulk, of, the, plains, of, venus, which, cover, 80, of, the, surface, are, basaltic, the, lunar, maria, are, plains, of, flood, basaltic, lava, flows, and, basalt, is, a, common, rock, on, the, surface, of, mars, molten, basalt, lava, has, a, low, viscosity, due, to, its, relatively, low, silica, content, between, 45, and, 52, resulting, in, rapidly, moving, lava, flows, that, can, spread, over, great, areas, before, cooling, and, solidifying, flood, basalts, are, thick, sequences, of, many, such, flows, that, can, cover, hundreds, of, thousands, of, square, kilometres, and, constitute, the, most, voluminous, of, all, volcanic, formations, basaltic, magmas, within, earth, are, thought, to, originate, from, the, upper, mantle, the, chemistry, of, basalts, thus, provides, clues, to, processes, deep, in, earth, s, interior, basalt, is, composed, mostly, of, oxides, of, silicon, iron, magnesium, potassium, aluminum, titanium, and, calcium, geologists, classify, igneous, rock, by, its, mineral, content, whenever, possible, the, relative, volume, percentages, of, quartz, crystalline, silica, sio, 2, alkali, feldspar, plagioclase, and, feldspathoid, qapf, are, particularly, important, an, aphanitic, fine, grained, igneous, rock, is, classified, as, basalt, when, its, qapf, fraction, is, composed, of, less, than, 10, feldspathoid, and, less, than, 20, quartz, and, plagioclase, makes, up, at, least, 65, of, its, feldspar, content, this, places, basalt, in, the, basalt, andesite, field, of, the, qapf, diagram, basalt, is, further, distinguished, from, andesite, by, its, silica, content, of, under, 52, it, is, often, not, practical, to, determine, the, mineral, composition, of, volcanic, rocks, due, to, their, very, small, grain, size, in, which, case, geologists, instead, classify, the, rocks, chemically, with, particular, emphasis, on, the, total, content, of, alkali, metal, oxides, and, silica, tas, in, that, context, basalt, is, defined, as, volcanic, rock, with, a, content, of, between, 45, and, 52, silica, and, no, more, than, 5, alkali, metal, oxides, this, places, basalt, in, the, b, field, of, the, tas, diagram, such, a, composition, is, described, as, mafic, basalt, is, usually, dark, grey, to, black, in, colour, due, to, a, high, content, of, augite, or, other, dark, coloured, pyroxene, minerals, but, can, exhibit, a, wide, range, of, shading, some, basalts, are, quite, light, coloured, due, to, a, high, content, of, plagioclase, these, are, sometimes, described, as, leucobasalts, it, can, be, difficult, to, distinguish, between, lighter, colored, basalt, and, andesite, so, field, researchers, commonly, use, a, rule, of, thumb, for, this, purpose, classifying, it, as, basalt, if, it, has, a, color, index, of, 35, or, greater, the, physical, properties, of, basalt, result, from, its, relatively, low, silica, content, and, typically, high, iron, and, magnesium, content, the, average, density, of, basalt, is, 2, 9, g, cm, 3, compared, for, example, to, granite, s, typical, density, of, 2, 7, g, cm, 3, the, viscosity, of, basaltic, magma, is, relatively, low, around, 10, 4, to, 10, 5, cp, similar, to, the, viscosity, of, ketchup, but, that, is, still, several, orders, of, magnitude, higher, than, the, viscosity, of, water, which, is, about, 1, cp, basalt, is, often, porphyritic, containing, larger, crystals, phenocrysts, that, formed, before, the, extrusion, event, that, brought, the, magma, to, the, surface, embedded, in, a, finer, grained, matrix, these, phenocrysts, are, usually, made, of, augite, olivine, or, a, calcium, rich, plagioclase, which, have, the, highest, melting, temperatures, of, any, of, the, minerals, that, can, typically, crystallize, from, the, melt, and, which, are, therefore, the, first, to, form, solid, crystals, basalt, often, contains, vesicles, they, are, formed, when, dissolved, gases, bubble, out, of, the, magma, as, it, decompresses, during, its, approach, to, the, surface, the, erupted, lava, then, solidifies, before, the, gases, can, escape, when, vesicles, make, up, a, substantial, fraction, of, the, volume, of, the, rock, the, rock, is, described, as, scoria, the, term, basalt, is, at, times, applied, to, shallow, intrusive, rocks, with, a, composition, typical, of, basalt, but, rocks, of, this, composition, with, a, phaneritic, coarser, groundmass, are, more, properly, referred, to, either, as, diabase, also, called, dolerite, or, when, they, are, more, coarse, grained, having, crystals, over, 2, mm, across, as, gabbro, diabase, and, gabbro, are, thus, the, hypabyssal, and, plutonic, equivalents, of, basalt, during, the, hadean, archean, and, early, proterozoic, eons, of, earth, s, history, the, chemistry, of, erupted, magmas, was, significantly, different, from, what, it, is, today, due, to, immature, crustal, and, asthenosphere, differentiation, the, resulting, ultramafic, volcanic, rocks, with, silica, sio, 2, contents, below, 45, and, high, magnesium, oxide, mgo, content, are, usually, classified, as, komatiites, the, word, basalt, is, ultimately, derived, from, late, latin, basaltes, a, misspelling, of, latin, basanites, very, hard, stone, which, was, imported, from, ancient, greek, basanites, from, basanos, touchstone, the, modern, petrological, term, basalt, describing, a, particular, composition, of, lava, derived, rock, became, standard, because, of, its, use, by, georgius, agricola, in, 1546, in, his, work, de, natura, fossilium, agricola, applied, the, term, basalt, to, the, volcanic, black, rock, beneath, the, bishop, of, meissen, s, stolpen, castle, believing, it, to, be, the, same, as, the, basaniten, described, by, pliny, the, elder, in, ad, 77, in, naturalis, historiae, on, earth, most, basalt, is, formed, by, decompression, melting, of, the, mantle, the, high, pressure, in, the, upper, mantle, due, to, the, weight, of, the, overlying, rock, raises, the, melting, point, of, mantle, rock, so, that, almost, all, of, the, upper, mantle, is, solid, however, mantle, rock, is, ductile, the, solid, rock, slowly, deforms, under, high, stress, when, tectonic, forces, cause, hot, mantle, rock, to, creep, upwards, pressure, on, the, ascending, rock, decreases, and, this, can, lower, its, melting, point, enough, for, the, rock, to, partially, melt, producing, basaltic, magma, decompression, melting, can, occur, in, a, variety, of, tectonic, settings, including, in, continental, rift, zones, at, mid, ocean, ridges, above, geological, hotspots, and, in, back, arc, basins, basalt, also, forms, in, subduction, zones, where, mantle, rock, rises, into, a, mantle, wedge, above, the, descending, slab, the, slab, releases, water, vapor, and, other, volatiles, as, it, descends, which, further, lowers, the, melting, point, further, increasing, the, amount, of, decompression, melting, each, tectonic, setting, produces, basalt, with, its, own, distinctive, characteristics, the, mineralogy, of, basalt, is, characterized, by, a, preponderance, of, calcic, plagioclase, feldspar, and, pyroxene, olivine, can, also, be, a, significant, constituent, accessory, minerals, present, in, relatively, minor, amounts, include, iron, oxides, and, iron, titanium, oxides, such, as, magnetite, ulv, spinel, and, ilmenite, because, of, the, presence, of, such, oxide, minerals, basalt, can, acquire, strong, magnetic, signatures, as, it, cools, and, paleomagnetic, studies, have, made, extensive, use, of, basalt, in, tholeiitic, basalt, pyroxene, augite, and, orthopyroxene, or, pigeonite, and, calcium, rich, plagioclase, are, common, phenocryst, minerals, olivine, may, also, be, a, phenocryst, and, when, present, may, have, rims, of, pigeonite, the, groundmass, contains, interstitial, quartz, or, tridymite, or, cristobalite, olivine, tholeiitic, basalt, has, augite, and, orthopyroxene, or, pigeonite, with, abundant, olivine, but, olivine, may, have, rims, of, pyroxene, and, is, unlikely, to, be, present, in, the, groundmass, alkali, basalts, typically, have, mineral, assemblages, that, lack, orthopyroxene, but, contain, olivine, feldspar, phenocrysts, typically, are, labradorite, to, andesine, in, composition, augite, is, rich, in, titanium, compared, to, augite, in, tholeiitic, basalt, minerals, such, as, alkali, feldspar, leucite, nepheline, sodalite, phlogopite, mica, and, apatite, may, be, present, in, the, groundmass, basalt, has, high, liquidus, and, solidus, temperatures, values, at, the, earth, s, surface, are, near, or, above, 1200, c, liquidus, and, near, or, below, 1000, c, solidus, these, values, are, higher, than, those, of, other, common, igneous, rocks, the, majority, of, tholeiitic, basalts, are, formed, at, approximately, 50, 100, km, depth, within, the, mantle, many, alkali, basalts, may, be, formed, at, greater, depths, perhaps, as, deep, as, 150, 200, km, the, origin, of, high, alumina, basalt, continues, to, be, controversial, with, disagreement, over, whether, it, is, a, primary, melt, or, derived, from, other, basalt, types, by, fractionation, 65, relative, to, most, common, igneous, rocks, basalt, compositions, are, rich, in, mgo, and, cao, and, low, in, sio, 2, and, the, alkali, oxides, i, e, na, 2, o, k, 2, o, consistent, with, their, tas, classification, basalt, contains, more, silica, than, picrobasalt, and, most, basanites, and, tephrites, but, less, than, basaltic, andesite, basalt, has, a, lower, total, content, of, alkali, oxides, than, trachybasalt, and, most, basanites, and, tephrites, basalt, generally, has, a, composition, of, 45, 52, wt, sio, 2, 2, 5, wt, total, alkalis, 0, 5, 2, 0, wt, tio, 2, 5, 14, wt, feo, and, 14, wt, or, more, al, 2, o, 3, contents, of, cao, are, commonly, near, 10, wt, those, of, mgo, commonly, in, the, range, 5, to, 12, wt, high, alumina, basalts, have, aluminium, contents, of, 17, 19, wt, al, 2, o, 3, boninites, have, magnesium, mgo, contents, of, up, to, 15, percent, rare, feldspathoid, rich, mafic, rocks, akin, to, alkali, basalts, may, have, na, 2, o, k, 2, o, contents, of, 12, or, more, the, abundances, of, the, lanthanide, or, rare, earth, elements, ree, can, be, a, useful, diagnostic, tool, to, help, explain, the, history, of, mineral, crystallisation, as, the, melt, cooled, in, particular, the, relative, abundance, of, europium, compared, to, the, other, ree, is, often, markedly, higher, or, lower, and, called, the, europium, anomaly, it, arises, because, eu, 2, can, substitute, for, ca, 2, in, plagioclase, feldspar, unlike, any, of, the, other, lanthanides, which, tend, to, only, form, 3, cations, mid, ocean, ridge, basalts, morb, and, their, intrusive, equivalents, gabbros, are, the, characteristic, igneous, rocks, formed, at, mid, ocean, ridges, they, are, tholeiitic, basalts, particularly, low, in, total, alkalis, and, in, incompatible, trace, elements, and, they, have, relatively, flat, ree, patterns, normalized, to, mantle, or, chondrite, values, in, contrast, alkali, basalts, have, normalized, patterns, highly, enriched, in, the, light, ree, and, with, greater, abundances, of, the, ree, and, of, other, incompatible, elements, because, morb, basalt, is, considered, a, key, to, understanding, plate, tectonics, its, compositions, have, been, much, studied, although, morb, compositions, are, distinctive, relative, to, average, compositions, of, basalts, erupted, in, other, environments, they, are, not, uniform, for, instance, compositions, change, with, position, along, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, and, the, compositions, also, define, different, ranges, in, different, ocean, basins, mid, ocean, ridge, basalts, have, been, subdivided, into, varieties, such, as, normal, nmorb, and, those, slightly, more, enriched, in, incompatible, elements, emorb, isotope, ratios, of, elements, such, as, strontium, neodymium, lead, hafnium, and, osmium, in, basalts, have, been, much, studied, to, learn, about, the, evolution, of, the, earth, s, mantle, isotopic, ratios, of, noble, gases, such, as, 3, he, 4, he, are, also, of, great, value, for, instance, ratios, for, basalts, range, from, 6, to, 10, for, mid, ocean, ridge, tholeiitic, basalt, normalized, to, atmospheric, values, but, to, 15, 24, and, more, for, ocean, island, basalts, thought, to, be, derived, from, mantle, plumes, source, rocks, for, the, partial, melts, that, produce, basaltic, magma, probably, include, both, peridotite, and, pyroxenite, the, shape, structure, and, texture, of, a, basalt, is, diagnostic, of, how, and, where, it, erupted, for, example, whether, into, the, sea, in, an, explosive, cinder, eruption, or, as, creeping, p, hoehoe, lava, flows, the, classic, image, of, hawaiian, basalt, eruptions, basalt, that, erupts, under, open, air, that, is, subaerially, forms, three, distinct, types, of, lava, or, volcanic, deposits, scoria, ash, or, cinder, breccia, and, lava, flows, basalt, in, the, tops, of, subaerial, lava, flows, and, cinder, cones, will, often, be, highly, vesiculated, imparting, a, lightweight, frothy, texture, to, the, rock, basaltic, cinders, are, often, red, coloured, by, oxidized, iron, from, weathered, iron, rich, minerals, such, as, pyroxene, a, types, of, blocky, cinder, and, breccia, flows, of, thick, viscous, basaltic, lava, are, common, in, hawai, i, p, hoehoe, is, a, highly, fluid, hot, form, of, basalt, which, tends, to, form, thin, aprons, of, molten, lava, which, fill, up, hollows, and, sometimes, forms, lava, lakes, lava, tubes, are, common, features, of, p, hoehoe, eruptions, basaltic, tuff, or, pyroclastic, rocks, are, less, common, than, basaltic, lava, flows, usually, basalt, is, too, hot, and, fluid, to, build, up, sufficient, pressure, to, form, explosive, lava, eruptions, but, occasionally, this, will, happen, by, trapping, of, the, lava, within, the, volcanic, throat, and, buildup, of, volcanic, gases, hawai, i, s, mauna, loa, volcano, erupted, in, this, way, in, the, 19th, century, as, did, mount, tarawera, new, zealand, in, its, violent, 1886, eruption, maar, volcanoes, are, typical, of, small, basalt, tuffs, formed, by, explosive, eruption, of, basalt, through, the, crust, forming, an, apron, of, mixed, basalt, and, wall, rock, breccia, and, a, fan, of, basalt, tuff, further, out, from, the, volcano, amygdaloidal, structure, is, common, in, relict, vesicles, and, beautifully, crystallized, species, of, zeolites, quartz, or, calcite, are, frequently, found, during, the, cooling, of, a, thick, lava, flow, contractional, joints, or, fractures, form, if, a, flow, cools, relatively, rapidly, significant, contraction, forces, build, up, while, a, flow, can, shrink, in, the, vertical, dimension, without, fracturing, it, cannot, easily, accommodate, shrinking, in, the, horizontal, direction, unless, cracks, form, the, extensive, fracture, network, that, develops, results, in, the, formation, of, columns, these, structures, are, predominantly, hexagonal, in, cross, section, but, polygons, with, three, to, twelve, or, more, sides, can, be, observed, the, size, of, the, columns, depends, loosely, on, the, rate, of, cooling, very, rapid, cooling, may, result, in, very, small, 1, cm, diameter, columns, while, slow, cooling, is, more, likely, to, produce, large, columns, the, character, of, submarine, basalt, eruptions, is, largely, determined, by, depth, of, water, since, increased, pressure, restricts, the, release, of, volatile, gases, and, results, in, effusive, eruptions, it, has, been, estimated, that, at, depths, greater, than, 500, metres, 1, 600, ft, explosive, activity, associated, with, basaltic, magma, is, suppressed, above, this, depth, submarine, eruptions, are, often, explosive, tending, to, produce, pyroclastic, rock, rather, than, basalt, flows, these, eruptions, described, as, surtseyan, are, characterised, by, large, quantities, of, steam, and, gas, and, the, creation, of, large, amounts, of, pumice, when, basalt, erupts, underwater, or, flows, into, the, sea, contact, with, the, water, quenches, the, surface, and, the, lava, forms, a, distinctive, pillow, shape, through, which, the, hot, lava, breaks, to, form, another, pillow, this, pillow, texture, is, very, common, in, underwater, basaltic, flows, and, is, diagnostic, of, an, underwater, eruption, environment, when, found, in, ancient, rocks, pillows, typically, consist, of, a, fine, grained, core, with, a, glassy, crust, and, have, radial, jointing, the, size, of, individual, pillows, varies, from, 10, cm, up, to, several, metres, when, p, hoehoe, lava, enters, the, sea, it, usually, forms, pillow, basalts, however, when, a, enters, the, ocean, it, forms, a, littoral, cone, a, small, cone, shaped, accumulation, of, tuffaceous, debris, formed, when, the, blocky, a, lava, enters, the, water, and, explodes, from, built, up, steam, the, island, of, surtsey, in, the, atlantic, ocean, is, a, basalt, volcano, which, breached, the, ocean, surface, in, 1963, the, initial, phase, of, surtsey, s, eruption, was, highly, explosive, as, the, magma, was, quite, fluid, causing, the, rock, to, be, blown, apart, by, the, boiling, steam, to, form, a, tuff, and, cinder, cone, this, has, subsequently, moved, to, a, typical, p, hoehoe, type, behaviour, volcanic, glass, may, be, present, particularly, as, rinds, on, rapidly, chilled, surfaces, of, lava, flows, and, is, commonly, but, not, exclusively, associated, with, underwater, eruptions, pillow, basalt, is, also, produced, by, some, subglacial, volcanic, eruptions, basalt, is, the, most, common, volcanic, rock, type, on, earth, making, up, over, 90, of, all, volcanic, rock, on, the, planet, the, crustal, portions, of, oceanic, tectonic, plates, are, composed, predominantly, of, basalt, produced, from, upwelling, mantle, below, the, ocean, ridges, basalt, is, also, the, principal, volcanic, rock, in, many, oceanic, islands, including, the, islands, of, hawai, i, the, faroe, islands, and, r, union, the, eruption, of, basalt, lava, is, observed, by, geologists, at, about, 20, volcanoes, per, year, basalt, is, the, rock, most, typical, of, large, igneous, provinces, these, include, continental, flood, basalts, the, most, voluminous, basalts, found, on, land, examples, of, continental, flood, basalts, included, the, deccan, traps, in, india, the, chilcotin, group, in, british, columbia, canada, the, paran, traps, in, brazil, the, siberian, traps, in, russia, the, karoo, flood, basalt, province, in, south, africa, and, the, columbia, river, plateau, of, washington, and, oregon, basalt, is, also, prevalent, across, extensive, regions, of, the, eastern, galilee, golan, and, bashan, in, israel, and, syria, basalt, also, is, common, around, volcanic, arcs, specially, those, on, thin, crust, ancient, precambrian, basalts, are, usually, only, found, in, fold, and, thrust, belts, and, are, often, heavily, metamorphosed, these, are, known, as, greenstone, belts, because, low, grade, metamorphism, of, basalt, produces, chlorite, actinolite, epidote, and, other, green, minerals, as, well, as, forming, large, parts, of, the, earth, s, crust, basalt, also, occurs, in, other, parts, of, the, solar, system, basalt, commonly, erupts, on, io, the, third, largest, moon, of, jupiter, and, has, also, formed, on, the, moon, mars, venus, and, the, asteroid, vesta, the, dark, areas, visible, on, earth, s, moon, the, lunar, maria, are, plains, of, flood, basaltic, lava, flows, these, rocks, were, sampled, both, by, the, crewed, american, apollo, program, and, the, robotic, russian, luna, program, and, are, represented, among, the, lunar, meteorites, lunar, basalts, differ, from, their, earth, counterparts, principally, in, their, high, iron, contents, which, typically, range, from, about, 17, to, 22, wt, feo, they, also, possess, a, wide, range, of, titanium, concentrations, present, in, the, mineral, ilmenite, ranging, from, less, than, 1, wt, tio, 2, to, about, 13, wt, traditionally, lunar, basalts, have, been, classified, according, to, their, titanium, content, with, classes, being, named, high, ti, low, ti, and, very, low, ti, nevertheless, global, geochemical, maps, of, titanium, obtained, from, the, clementine, mission, demonstrate, that, the, lunar, maria, possess, a, continuum, of, titanium, concentrations, and, that, the, highest, concentrations, are, the, least, abundant, lunar, basalts, show, exotic, textures, and, mineralogy, particularly, shock, metamorphism, lack, of, the, oxidation, typical, of, terrestrial, basalts, and, a, complete, lack, of, hydration, most, of, the, moon, s, basalts, erupted, between, about, 3, and, 3, 5, billion, years, ago, but, the, oldest, samples, are, 4, 2, billion, years, old, and, the, youngest, flows, based, on, the, age, dating, method, of, crater, counting, are, estimated, to, have, erupted, only, 1, 2, billion, years, ago, from, 1972, to, 1985, five, venera, and, two, vega, landers, successfully, reached, the, surface, of, venus, and, carried, out, geochemical, measurements, using, x, ray, fluorescence, and, gamma, ray, analysis, these, returned, results, consistent, with, the, rock, at, the, landing, sites, being, basalts, including, both, tholeiitic, and, highly, alkaline, basalts, the, landers, are, thought, to, have, landed, on, plains, whose, radar, signature, is, that, of, basaltic, lava, flows, these, constitute, about, 80, of, the, surface, of, venus, some, locations, show, high, reflectivity, consistent, with, unweathered, basalt, indicating, basaltic, volcanism, within, the, last, 2, 5, million, years, basalt, is, also, a, common, rock, on, the, surface, of, mars, as, determined, by, data, sent, back, from, the, planet, s, surface, and, by, martian, meteorites, analysis, of, hubble, space, telescope, images, of, vesta, suggests, this, asteroid, has, a, basaltic, crust, covered, with, a, brecciated, regolith, derived, from, the, crust, evidence, from, earth, based, telescopes, and, the, dawn, mission, suggest, that, vesta, is, the, source, of, the, hed, meteorites, which, have, basaltic, characteristics, vesta, is, the, main, contributor, to, the, inventory, of, basaltic, asteroids, of, the, main, asteroid, belt, lava, flows, represent, a, major, volcanic, terrain, on, io, analysis, of, the, voyager, images, led, scientists, to, believe, that, these, flows, were, composed, mostly, of, various, compounds, of, molten, sulfur, however, subsequent, earth, based, infrared, studies, and, measurements, from, the, galileo, spacecraft, indicate, that, these, flows, are, composed, of, basaltic, lava, with, mafic, to, ultramafic, compositions, this, conclusion, is, based, on, temperature, measurements, of, io, s, hotspots, or, thermal, emission, locations, which, suggest, temperatures, of, at, least, 1, 300, k, and, some, as, high, as, 1, 600, k, initial, estimates, suggesting, eruption, temperatures, approaching, 2, 000, k, have, since, proven, to, be, overestimates, because, the, wrong, thermal, models, were, used, to, model, the, temperatures, compared, to, granitic, rocks, exposed, at, the, earth, s, surface, basalt, outcrops, weather, relatively, rapidly, this, reflects, their, content, of, minerals, that, crystallized, at, higher, temperatures, and, in, an, environment, poorer, in, water, vapor, than, granite, these, minerals, are, less, stable, in, the, colder, wetter, environment, at, the, earth, s, surface, the, finer, grain, size, of, basalt, and, the, volcanic, glass, sometimes, found, between, the, grains, also, hasten, weathering, the, high, iron, content, of, basalt, causes, weathered, surfaces, in, humid, climates, to, accumulate, a, thick, crust, of, hematite, or, other, iron, oxides, and, hydroxides, staining, the, rock, a, brown, to, rust, red, colour, because, of, the, low, potassium, content, of, most, basalts, weathering, converts, the, basalt, to, calcium, rich, clay, montmorillonite, rather, than, potassium, rich, clay, illite, further, weathering, particularly, in, tropical, climates, converts, the, montmorillonite, to, kaolinite, or, gibbsite, this, produces, the, distinctive, tropical, soil, known, as, laterite, the, ultimate, weathering, product, is, bauxite, the, principal, ore, of, aluminium, chemical, weathering, also, releases, readily, water, soluble, cations, such, as, calcium, sodium, and, magnesium, which, give, basaltic, areas, a, strong, buffer, capacity, against, acidification, calcium, released, by, basalts, binds, co, 2, from, the, atmosphere, forming, caco, 3, acting, thus, as, a, co, 2, trap, intense, heat, or, great, pressure, transforms, basalt, into, its, metamorphic, rock, equivalents, depending, on, the, temperature, and, pressure, of, metamorphism, these, may, include, greenschist, amphibolite, or, eclogite, basalts, are, important, rocks, within, metamorphic, regions, because, they, can, provide, vital, information, on, the, conditions, of, metamorphism, that, have, affected, the, region, metamorphosed, basalts, are, important, hosts, for, a, variety, of, hydrothermal, ores, including, deposits, of, gold, copper, and, volcanogenic, massive, sulfides, the, common, corrosion, features, of, underwater, volcanic, basalt, suggest, that, microbial, activity, may, play, a, significant, role, in, the, chemical, exchange, between, basaltic, rocks, and, seawater, the, significant, amounts, of, reduced, iron, fe, ii, and, manganese, mn, ii, present, in, basaltic, rocks, provide, potential, energy, sources, for, bacteria, some, fe, ii, oxidizing, bacteria, cultured, from, iron, sulfide, surfaces, are, also, able, to, grow, with, basaltic, rock, as, a, source, of, fe, ii, fe, and, mn, oxidizing, bacteria, have, been, cultured, from, weathered, submarine, basalts, of, kama, ehuakanaloa, seamount, formerly, loihi, the, impact, of, bacteria, on, altering, the, chemical, composition, of, basaltic, glass, and, thus, the, oceanic, crust, and, seawater, suggest, that, these, interactions, may, lead, to, an, application, of, hydrothermal, vents, to, the, origin, of, life, basalt, is, used, in, construction, e, g, as, building, blocks, or, in, the, groundwork, making, cobblestones, from, columnar, basalt, and, in, making, statues, heating, and, extruding, basalt, yields, stone, wool, which, has, potential, to, be, an, excellent, thermal, insulator, carbon, sequestration, in, basalt, has, been, studied, as, a, means, of, removing, carbon, dioxide, produced, by, human, industrialization, from, the, atmosphere, underwater, basalt, deposits, scattered, in, seas, around, the, globe, have, the, added, benefit, of, the, water, serving, as, a, barrier, to, the, re, release, of, co, 2, into, the, atmosphere, volcanic, rocks, subvolcanic, rocks, plutonic, rocks, picrite, basalt, peridotite, basalt,
