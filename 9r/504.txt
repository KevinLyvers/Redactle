in, organic, chemistry, a, carboxylic, acid, is, an, organic, acid, that, contains, a, carboxyl, group, c, o, oh, attached, to, an, r, group, the, general, formula, of, a, carboxylic, acid, is, often, written, as, r, cooh, or, r, co, 2, h, sometimes, as, r, c, o, oh, with, r, referring, to, an, organyl, group, e, g, alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, or, hydrogen, or, other, groups, carboxylic, acids, occur, widely, important, examples, include, the, amino, acids, and, fatty, acids, deprotonation, of, a, carboxylic, acid, gives, a, carboxylate, anion, carboxylic, acids, are, commonly, identified, by, their, trivial, names, they, often, have, the, suffix, ic, acid, iupac, recommended, names, also, exist, in, this, system, carboxylic, acids, have, an, oic, acid, suffix, for, example, butyric, acid, ch, 3, ch, 2, ch, 2, co, 2, h, is, butanoic, acid, by, iupac, guidelines, for, nomenclature, of, complex, molecules, containing, a, carboxylic, acid, the, carboxyl, can, be, considered, position, one, of, the, parent, chain, even, if, there, are, other, substituents, such, as, 3, chloropropanoic, acid, alternately, it, can, be, named, as, a, carboxy, or, carboxylic, acid, substituent, on, another, parent, structure, such, as, 2, carboxyfuran, the, carboxylate, anion, r, coo, or, r, co, 2, of, a, carboxylic, acid, is, usually, named, with, the, suffix, ate, in, keeping, with, the, general, pattern, of, ic, acid, and, ate, for, a, conjugate, acid, and, its, conjugate, base, respectively, for, example, the, conjugate, base, of, acetic, acid, is, acetate, carbonic, acid, which, occurs, in, bicarbonate, buffer, systems, in, nature, is, not, generally, classed, as, one, of, the, carboxylic, acids, despite, that, it, has, a, moiety, that, looks, like, a, cooh, group, carboxylic, acids, are, polar, because, they, are, both, hydrogen, bond, acceptors, the, carbonyl, c, o, and, hydrogen, bond, donors, the, hydroxyl, oh, they, also, participate, in, hydrogen, bonding, together, the, hydroxyl, and, carbonyl, group, form, the, functional, group, carboxyl, carboxylic, acids, usually, exist, as, dimers, in, nonpolar, media, due, to, their, tendency, to, self, associate, smaller, carboxylic, acids, 1, to, 5, carbons, are, soluble, in, water, whereas, bigger, carboxylic, acids, have, limited, solubility, due, to, the, increasing, hydrophobic, nature, of, the, alkyl, chain, these, longer, chain, acids, tend, to, be, soluble, in, less, polar, solvents, such, as, ethers, and, alcohols, aqueous, sodium, hydroxide, and, carboxylic, acids, even, hydrophobic, ones, react, to, yield, water, soluble, sodium, salts, for, example, enanthic, acid, has, a, low, solubility, in, water, 0, 2, g, l, but, its, sodium, salt, is, very, soluble, in, water, carboxylic, acids, tend, to, have, higher, boiling, points, than, water, because, of, their, greater, surface, areas, and, their, tendency, to, form, stabilized, dimers, through, hydrogen, bonds, for, boiling, to, occur, either, the, dimer, bonds, must, be, broken, or, the, entire, dimer, arrangement, must, be, vaporized, increasing, the, enthalpy, of, vaporization, requirements, significantly, carboxylic, acids, are, br, nsted, lowry, acids, because, they, are, proton, h, donors, they, are, the, most, common, type, of, organic, acid, carboxylic, acids, are, typically, weak, acids, meaning, that, they, only, partially, dissociate, into, cations, and, r, co, 2, anions, in, neutral, aqueous, solution, for, example, at, room, temperature, in, a, 1, molar, solution, of, acetic, acid, only, 0, 001, of, the, acid, are, dissociated, i, e, 10, 5, moles, out, of, 1, mol, electron, withdrawing, substituents, such, as, cf, 3, group, give, stronger, acids, the, p, k, a, of, acetic, acid, is, 4, 76, whereas, trifluoroacetic, acid, with, a, trifluoromethyl, substituent, has, a, p, k, a, of, 0, 23, electron, donating, substituents, give, weaker, acids, the, p, k, a, of, formic, acid, is, 3, 75, whereas, acetic, acid, with, a, methyl, substituent, has, a, p, k, a, of, 4, 76, deprotonation, of, carboxylic, acids, gives, carboxylate, anions, these, are, resonance, stabilized, because, the, negative, charge, is, delocalized, over, the, two, oxygen, atoms, increasing, the, stability, of, the, anion, each, of, the, carbon, oxygen, bonds, in, the, carboxylate, anion, has, a, partial, double, bond, character, the, carbonyl, carbon, s, partial, positive, charge, is, also, weakened, by, the, 1, 2, negative, charges, on, the, 2, oxygen, atoms, carboxylic, acids, often, have, strong, sour, odours, esters, of, carboxylic, acids, tend, to, have, fruity, pleasant, odours, and, many, are, used, in, perfume, carboxylic, acids, are, readily, identified, as, such, by, infrared, spectroscopy, they, exhibit, a, sharp, band, associated, with, vibration, of, the, c, o, carbonyl, bond, c, o, between, 1680, and, 1725, cm, 1, a, characteristic, o, h, band, appears, as, a, broad, peak, in, the, 2500, to, 3000, cm, 1, region, by, 1, h, nmr, spectrometry, the, hydroxyl, hydrogen, appears, in, the, 10, 13, ppm, region, although, it, is, often, either, broadened, or, not, observed, owing, to, exchange, with, traces, of, water, many, carboxylic, acids, are, produced, industrially, on, a, large, scale, they, are, also, frequently, found, in, nature, esters, of, fatty, acids, are, the, main, components, of, lipids, and, polyamides, of, aminocarboxylic, acids, are, the, main, components, of, proteins, carboxylic, acids, are, used, in, the, production, of, polymers, pharmaceuticals, solvents, and, food, additives, industrially, important, carboxylic, acids, include, acetic, acid, component, of, vinegar, precursor, to, solvents, and, coatings, acrylic, and, methacrylic, acids, precursors, to, polymers, adhesives, adipic, acid, polymers, citric, acid, a, flavor, and, preservative, in, food, and, beverages, ethylenediaminetetraacetic, acid, chelating, agent, fatty, acids, coatings, maleic, acid, polymers, propionic, acid, food, preservative, terephthalic, acid, polymers, important, carboxylate, salts, are, soaps, in, general, industrial, routes, to, carboxylic, acids, differ, from, those, used, on, a, smaller, scale, because, they, require, specialized, equipment, preparative, methods, for, small, scale, reactions, for, research, or, for, production, of, fine, chemicals, often, employ, expensive, consumable, reagents, many, reactions, produce, carboxylic, acids, but, are, used, only, in, specific, cases, or, are, mainly, of, academic, interest, carboxylic, acids, react, with, bases, to, form, carboxylate, salts, in, which, the, hydrogen, of, the, hydroxyl, oh, group, is, replaced, with, a, metal, cation, for, example, acetic, acid, found, in, vinegar, reacts, with, sodium, bicarbonate, baking, soda, to, form, sodium, acetate, carbon, dioxide, and, water, widely, practiced, reactions, convert, carboxylic, acids, into, esters, amides, carboxylate, salts, acid, chlorides, and, alcohols, their, conversion, to, esters, is, widely, used, e, g, in, the, production, of, polyesters, likewise, carboxylic, acids, are, converted, into, amides, but, this, conversion, typically, does, not, occur, by, direct, reaction, of, the, carboxylic, acid, and, the, amine, instead, esters, are, typical, precursors, to, amides, the, conversion, of, amino, acids, into, peptides, is, a, significant, biochemical, process, that, requires, atp, converting, a, carboxylic, acid, to, an, amide, is, possible, but, not, straightforward, instead, of, acting, as, a, nucleophile, an, amine, will, react, as, a, base, in, the, presence, of, a, carboxylic, acid, to, give, the, ammonium, carboxylate, salt, heating, the, salt, to, above, 100, c, will, drive, off, water, and, lead, to, the, formation, of, the, amide, this, method, of, synthesizing, amides, is, industrially, important, and, has, laboratory, applications, as, well, in, the, presence, of, a, strong, acid, catalyst, carboxylic, acids, can, condense, to, form, acid, anhydrides, the, condensation, produces, water, however, which, can, hydrolyze, the, anhydride, back, to, the, starting, carboxylic, acids, thus, the, formation, of, the, anhydride, via, condensation, is, an, equilibrium, process, under, acid, catalyzed, conditions, carboxylic, acids, will, react, with, alcohols, to, form, esters, via, the, fischer, esterification, reaction, which, is, also, an, equilibrium, process, alternatively, diazomethane, can, be, used, to, convert, an, acid, to, an, ester, while, esterification, reactions, with, diazomethane, often, give, quantitative, yields, diazomethane, is, only, useful, for, forming, methyl, esters, like, esters, most, carboxylic, acids, can, be, reduced, to, alcohols, by, hydrogenation, or, using, hydride, transferring, agents, such, as, lithium, aluminium, hydride, strong, alkyl, transferring, agents, such, as, organolithium, compounds, but, not, grignard, reagents, will, reduce, carboxylic, acids, to, ketones, along, with, transfer, of, the, alkyl, group, the, vilsmaier, reagent, n, n, dimethyl, chloromethylene, ammonium, chloride, cl, is, a, highly, chemoselective, agent, for, carboxylic, acid, reduction, it, selectively, activates, the, carboxylic, acid, to, give, the, carboxymethyleneammonium, salt, which, can, be, reduced, by, a, mild, reductant, like, lithium, tris, t, butoxy, aluminum, hydride, to, afford, an, aldehyde, in, a, one, pot, procedure, this, procedure, is, known, to, tolerate, reactive, carbonyl, functionalities, such, as, ketone, as, well, as, moderately, reactive, ester, olefin, nitrile, and, halide, moieties, the, hydroxyl, group, on, carboxylic, acids, may, be, replaced, with, a, chlorine, atom, using, thionyl, chloride, to, give, acyl, chlorides, in, nature, carboxylic, acids, are, converted, to, thioesters, thionyl, chloride, can, be, used, to, convert, carboxylic, acids, to, their, corresponding, acyl, chlorides, first, carboxylic, acid, 1, attacks, thionyl, chloride, and, chloride, ion, leaves, the, resulting, oxonium, ion, 2, is, activated, towards, nucleophilic, attack, and, has, a, good, leaving, group, setting, it, apart, from, a, normal, carboxylic, acid, in, the, next, step, 2, is, attacked, by, chloride, ion, to, give, tetrahedral, intermediate, 3, a, chlorosulfite, the, tetrahedral, intermediate, collapses, with, the, loss, of, sulfur, dioxide, and, chloride, ion, giving, protonated, acyl, chloride, 4, chloride, ion, can, remove, the, proton, on, the, carbonyl, group, giving, the, acyl, chloride, 5, with, a, loss, of, hcl, phosphorus, iii, chloride, pcl, 3, and, phosphorus, v, chloride, pcl, 5, will, also, convert, carboxylic, acids, to, acid, chlorides, by, a, similar, mechanism, one, equivalent, of, pcl, 3, can, react, with, three, equivalents, of, acid, producing, one, equivalent, of, h, 3, po, 3, or, phosphorus, acid, in, addition, to, the, desired, acid, chloride, pcl, 5, reacts, with, carboxylic, acids, in, a, 1, 1, ratio, and, produces, phosphorus, v, oxychloride, pocl, 3, and, hydrogen, chloride, hcl, as, byproducts, carboxylic, acids, react, with, grignard, reagents, and, organolithiums, to, form, ketones, the, first, equivalent, of, nucleophile, acts, as, a, base, and, deprotonates, the, acid, a, second, equivalent, will, attack, the, carbonyl, group, to, create, a, geminal, alkoxide, dianion, which, is, protonated, upon, workup, to, give, the, hydrate, of, a, ketone, because, most, ketone, hydrates, are, unstable, relative, to, their, corresponding, ketones, the, equilibrium, between, the, two, is, shifted, heavily, in, favor, of, the, ketone, for, example, the, equilibrium, constant, for, the, formation, of, acetone, hydrate, from, acetone, is, only, 0, 002, the, carboxylic, group, is, the, most, acidic, in, organic, compounds, the, carboxyl, radical, cooh, only, exists, briefly, the, acid, dissociation, constant, of, cooh, has, been, measured, using, electron, paramagnetic, resonance, spectroscopy, the, carboxyl, group, tends, to, dimerise, to, form, oxalic, acid
