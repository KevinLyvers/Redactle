the, theory, of, relativity, usually, encompasses, two, interrelated, physics, theories, by, albert, einstein, special, relativity, and, general, relativity, proposed, and, published, in, 1905, and, 1915, respectively, special, relativity, applies, to, all, physical, phenomena, in, the, absence, of, gravity, general, relativity, explains, the, law, of, gravitation, and, its, relation, to, the, forces, of, nature, it, applies, to, the, cosmological, and, astrophysical, realm, including, astronomy, the, theory, transformed, theoretical, physics, and, astronomy, during, the, 20th, century, superseding, a, 200, year, old, theory, of, mechanics, created, primarily, by, isaac, newton, it, introduced, concepts, including, 4, dimensional, spacetime, as, a, unified, entity, of, space, and, time, relativity, of, simultaneity, kinematic, and, gravitational, time, dilation, and, length, contraction, in, the, field, of, physics, relativity, improved, the, science, of, elementary, particles, and, their, fundamental, interactions, along, with, ushering, in, the, nuclear, age, with, relativity, cosmology, and, astrophysics, predicted, extraordinary, astronomical, phenomena, such, as, neutron, stars, black, holes, and, gravitational, waves, albert, einstein, published, the, theory, of, special, relativity, in, 1905, building, on, many, theoretical, results, and, empirical, findings, obtained, by, albert, a, michelson, hendrik, lorentz, henri, poincar, and, others, max, planck, hermann, minkowski, and, others, did, subsequent, work, einstein, developed, general, relativity, between, 1907, and, 1915, with, contributions, by, many, others, after, 1915, the, final, form, of, general, relativity, was, published, in, 1916, the, term, theory, of, relativity, was, based, on, the, expression, relative, theory, german, relativtheorie, used, in, 1906, by, planck, who, emphasized, how, the, theory, uses, the, principle, of, relativity, in, the, discussion, section, of, the, same, paper, alfred, bucherer, used, for, the, first, time, the, expression, theory, of, relativity, german, relativit, tstheorie, by, the, 1920s, the, physics, community, understood, and, accepted, special, relativity, it, rapidly, became, a, significant, and, necessary, tool, for, theorists, and, experimentalists, in, the, new, fields, of, atomic, physics, nuclear, physics, and, quantum, mechanics, by, comparison, general, relativity, did, not, appear, to, be, as, useful, beyond, making, minor, corrections, to, predictions, of, newtonian, gravitation, theory, it, seemed, to, offer, little, potential, for, experimental, test, as, most, of, its, assertions, were, on, an, astronomical, scale, its, mathematics, seemed, difficult, and, fully, understandable, only, by, a, small, number, of, people, around, 1960, general, relativity, became, central, to, physics, and, astronomy, new, mathematical, techniques, to, apply, to, general, relativity, streamlined, calculations, and, made, its, concepts, more, easily, visualized, as, astronomical, phenomena, were, discovered, such, as, quasars, 1963, the, 3, kelvin, microwave, background, radiation, 1965, pulsars, 1967, and, the, first, black, hole, candidates, 1981, the, theory, explained, their, attributes, and, measurement, of, them, further, confirmed, the, theory, special, relativity, is, a, theory, of, the, structure, of, spacetime, it, was, introduced, in, einstein, s, 1905, paper, on, the, electrodynamics, of, moving, bodies, for, the, contributions, of, many, other, physicists, and, mathematicians, see, history, of, special, relativity, special, relativity, is, based, on, two, postulates, which, are, contradictory, in, classical, mechanics, the, resultant, theory, copes, with, experiment, better, than, classical, mechanics, for, instance, postulate, 2, explains, the, results, of, the, michelson, morley, experiment, moreover, the, theory, has, many, surprising, and, counterintuitive, consequences, some, of, these, are, the, defining, feature, of, special, relativity, is, the, replacement, of, the, galilean, transformations, of, classical, mechanics, by, the, lorentz, transformations, see, maxwell, s, equations, of, electromagnetism, general, relativity, is, a, theory, of, gravitation, developed, by, einstein, in, the, years, 1907, 1915, the, development, of, general, relativity, began, with, the, equivalence, principle, under, which, the, states, of, accelerated, motion, and, being, at, rest, in, a, gravitational, field, for, example, when, standing, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, are, physically, identical, the, upshot, of, this, is, that, free, fall, is, inertial, motion, an, object, in, free, fall, is, falling, because, that, is, how, objects, move, when, there, is, no, force, being, exerted, on, them, instead, of, this, being, due, to, the, force, of, gravity, as, is, the, case, in, classical, mechanics, this, is, incompatible, with, classical, mechanics, and, special, relativity, because, in, those, theories, inertially, moving, objects, cannot, accelerate, with, respect, to, each, other, but, objects, in, free, fall, do, so, to, resolve, this, difficulty, einstein, first, proposed, that, spacetime, is, curved, einstein, discussed, his, idea, with, mathematician, marcel, grossmann, and, they, concluded, that, general, relativity, could, be, formulated, in, the, context, of, riemannian, geometry, which, had, been, developed, in, the, 1800s, in, 1915, he, devised, the, einstein, field, equations, which, relate, the, curvature, of, spacetime, with, the, mass, energy, and, any, momentum, within, it, some, of, the, consequences, of, general, relativity, are, technically, general, relativity, is, a, theory, of, gravitation, whose, defining, feature, is, its, use, of, the, einstein, field, equations, the, solutions, of, the, field, equations, are, metric, tensors, which, define, the, topology, of, the, spacetime, and, how, objects, move, inertially, einstein, stated, that, the, theory, of, relativity, belongs, to, a, class, of, principle, theories, as, such, it, employs, an, analytic, method, which, means, that, the, elements, of, this, theory, are, not, based, on, hypothesis, but, on, empirical, discovery, by, observing, natural, processes, we, understand, their, general, characteristics, devise, mathematical, models, to, describe, what, we, observed, and, by, analytical, means, we, deduce, the, necessary, conditions, that, have, to, be, satisfied, measurement, of, separate, events, must, satisfy, these, conditions, and, match, the, theory, s, conclusions, relativity, is, a, falsifiable, theory, it, makes, predictions, that, can, be, tested, by, experiment, in, the, case, of, special, relativity, these, include, the, principle, of, relativity, the, constancy, of, the, speed, of, light, and, time, dilation, the, predictions, of, special, relativity, have, been, confirmed, in, numerous, tests, since, einstein, published, his, paper, in, 1905, but, three, experiments, conducted, between, 1881, and, 1938, were, critical, to, its, validation, these, are, the, michelson, morley, experiment, the, kennedy, thorndike, experiment, and, the, ives, stilwell, experiment, einstein, derived, the, lorentz, transformations, from, first, principles, in, 1905, but, these, three, experiments, allow, the, transformations, to, be, induced, from, experimental, evidence, maxwell, s, equations, the, foundation, of, classical, electromagnetism, describe, light, as, a, wave, that, moves, with, a, characteristic, velocity, the, modern, view, is, that, light, needs, no, medium, of, transmission, but, maxwell, and, his, contemporaries, were, convinced, that, light, waves, were, propagated, in, a, medium, analogous, to, sound, propagating, in, air, and, ripples, propagating, on, the, surface, of, a, pond, this, hypothetical, medium, was, called, the, luminiferous, aether, at, rest, relative, to, the, fixed, stars, and, through, which, the, earth, moves, fresnel, s, partial, ether, dragging, hypothesis, ruled, out, the, measurement, of, first, order, v, c, effects, and, although, observations, of, second, order, effects, v, 2, c, 2, were, possible, in, principle, maxwell, thought, they, were, too, small, to, be, detected, with, then, current, technology, the, michelson, morley, experiment, was, designed, to, detect, second, order, effects, of, the, aether, wind, the, motion, of, the, aether, relative, to, the, earth, michelson, designed, an, instrument, called, the, michelson, interferometer, to, accomplish, this, the, apparatus, was, sufficiently, accurate, to, detect, the, expected, effects, but, he, obtained, a, null, result, when, the, first, experiment, was, conducted, in, 1881, and, again, in, 1887, although, the, failure, to, detect, an, aether, wind, was, a, disappointment, the, results, were, accepted, by, the, scientific, community, in, an, attempt, to, salvage, the, aether, paradigm, fitzgerald, and, lorentz, independently, created, an, ad, hoc, hypothesis, in, which, the, length, of, material, bodies, changes, according, to, their, motion, through, the, aether, this, was, the, origin, of, fitzgerald, lorentz, contraction, and, their, hypothesis, had, no, theoretical, basis, the, interpretation, of, the, null, result, of, the, michelson, morley, experiment, is, that, the, round, trip, travel, time, for, light, is, isotropic, independent, of, direction, but, the, result, alone, is, not, enough, to, discount, the, theory, of, the, aether, or, validate, the, predictions, of, special, relativity, while, the, michelson, morley, experiment, showed, that, the, velocity, of, light, is, isotropic, it, said, nothing, about, how, the, magnitude, of, the, velocity, changed, if, at, all, in, different, inertial, frames, the, kennedy, thorndike, experiment, was, designed, to, do, that, and, was, first, performed, in, 1932, by, roy, kennedy, and, edward, thorndike, they, obtained, a, null, result, and, concluded, that, there, is, no, effect, unless, the, velocity, of, the, solar, system, in, space, is, no, more, than, about, half, that, of, the, earth, in, its, orbit, that, possibility, was, thought, to, be, too, coincidental, to, provide, an, acceptable, explanation, so, from, the, null, result, of, their, experiment, it, was, concluded, that, the, round, trip, time, for, light, is, the, same, in, all, inertial, reference, frames, the, ives, stilwell, experiment, was, carried, out, by, herbert, ives, and, g, r, stilwell, first, in, 1938, and, with, better, accuracy, in, 1941, it, was, designed, to, test, the, transverse, doppler, effect, the, redshift, of, light, from, a, moving, source, in, a, direction, perpendicular, to, its, velocity, which, had, been, predicted, by, einstein, in, 1905, the, strategy, was, to, compare, observed, doppler, shifts, with, what, was, predicted, by, classical, theory, and, look, for, a, lorentz, factor, correction, such, a, correction, was, observed, from, which, was, concluded, that, the, frequency, of, a, moving, atomic, clock, is, altered, according, to, special, relativity, those, classic, experiments, have, been, repeated, many, times, with, increased, precision, other, experiments, include, for, instance, relativistic, energy, and, momentum, increase, at, high, velocities, experimental, testing, of, time, dilation, and, modern, searches, for, lorentz, violations, general, relativity, has, also, been, confirmed, many, times, the, classic, experiments, being, the, perihelion, precession, of, mercury, s, orbit, the, deflection, of, light, by, the, sun, and, the, gravitational, redshift, of, light, other, tests, confirmed, the, equivalence, principle, and, frame, dragging, far, from, being, simply, of, theoretical, interest, relativistic, effects, are, important, practical, engineering, concerns, satellite, based, measurement, needs, to, take, into, account, relativistic, effects, as, each, satellite, is, in, motion, relative, to, an, earth, bound, user, and, is, thus, in, a, different, frame, of, reference, under, the, theory, of, relativity, global, positioning, systems, such, as, gps, glonass, and, galileo, must, account, for, all, of, the, relativistic, effects, in, order, to, work, with, precision, such, as, the, consequences, of, the, earth, s, gravitational, field, this, is, also, the, case, in, the, high, precision, measurement, of, time, instruments, ranging, from, electron, microscopes, to, particle, accelerators, would, not, work, if, relativistic, considerations, were, omitted
