and, a, gluon, l, u, n, gloo, on, is, a, type, of, massless, elementary, particle, that, mediates, the, strong, interaction, between, quarks, acting, as, the, exchange, particle, for, the, interaction, gluons, are, massless, vector, bosons, thereby, having, a, spin, of, 1, through, the, strong, interaction, gluons, bind, quarks, into, groups, according, to, quantum, chromodynamics, qcd, forming, hadrons, such, as, protons, and, neutrons, gluons, carry, the, color, charge, of, the, strong, interaction, thereby, participating, in, the, strong, interaction, as, well, as, mediating, it, because, gluons, carry, the, color, charge, qcd, is, more, difficult, to, analyze, compared, to, quantum, electrodynamics, qed, where, the, photon, carries, no, electric, charge, the, term, was, coined, by, murray, gell, mann, in, 1962, for, being, similar, to, an, adhesive, or, glue, that, keeps, the, nucleus, together, together, with, the, quarks, these, particles, were, referred, to, as, partons, by, richard, feynman, the, gluon, is, a, vector, boson, which, means, it, has, a, spin, of, 1, while, massive, spin, 1, particles, have, three, polarization, states, massless, gauge, bosons, like, the, gluon, have, only, two, polarization, states, because, gauge, invariance, requires, the, field, polarization, to, be, transverse, to, the, direction, that, the, gluon, is, traveling, in, quantum, field, theory, unbroken, gauge, invariance, requires, that, gauge, bosons, have, zero, mass, experiments, limit, the, gluon, s, rest, mass, if, any, to, less, than, a, few, mev, c, 2, the, gluon, has, negative, intrinsic, parity, there, are, eight, independent, types, of, gluons, in, qcd, this, is, unlike, the, photon, of, qed, or, the, three, w, and, z, bosons, of, the, weak, interaction, additionally, gluons, are, subject, to, the, color, charge, phenomena, quarks, carry, three, types, of, color, charge, antiquarks, carry, three, types, of, anticolor, gluons, carry, both, color, and, anticolor, this, gives, nine, possible, combinations, of, color, and, anticolor, in, gluons, the, following, is, a, list, of, those, combinations, and, their, schematic, names, these, possible, combinations, are, only, effective, states, not, the, actual, observed, color, states, of, gluons, to, understand, how, they, are, combined, it, is, necessary, to, consider, the, mathematics, of, color, charge, in, more, detail, the, stable, strongly, interacting, particles, including, hadrons, like, the, proton, or, the, neutron, are, observed, to, be, colorless, more, precisely, they, are, in, a, color, singlet, state, and, mathematically, analogous, to, a, spin, singlet, state, the, states, allow, interaction, with, other, color, singlets, but, not, other, color, states, because, long, range, gluon, interactions, do, not, exist, this, illustrates, that, gluons, in, the, singlet, state, do, not, exist, either, the, color, singlet, state, is, if, one, could, measure, the, color, of, the, state, there, would, be, equal, probabilities, of, it, being, red, antired, blue, antiblue, or, green, antigreen, there, are, eight, remaining, independent, color, states, corresponding, to, the, eight, types, or, eight, colors, of, gluons, since, the, states, can, be, mixed, together, there, are, multiple, ways, of, presenting, these, states, these, are, known, as, the, color, octet, and, a, commonly, used, list, for, each, is, these, are, equivalent, to, the, gell, mann, matrices, the, critical, feature, of, these, particular, eight, states, is, that, they, are, linearly, independent, and, also, independent, of, the, singlet, state, hence, 3, 2, 1, or, 2, 3, there, is, no, way, to, add, any, combination, of, these, states, to, produce, any, others, it, is, also, impossible, to, add, them, to, make, r, r, g, g, or, b, b, the, forbidden, singlet, state, there, are, many, other, possible, choices, but, all, are, mathematically, equivalent, at, least, equally, complicated, and, give, the, same, physical, results, formally, qcd, is, a, gauge, theory, with, su, 3, gauge, symmetry, quarks, are, introduced, as, spinors, in, n, f, flavors, each, in, the, fundamental, representation, triplet, denoted, 3, of, the, color, gauge, group, su, 3, the, gluons, are, vectors, in, the, adjoint, representation, octets, denoted, 8, of, color, su, 3, for, a, general, gauge, group, the, number, of, force, carriers, like, photons, or, gluons, is, always, equal, to, the, dimension, of, the, adjoint, representation, for, the, simple, case, of, su, n, the, dimension, of, this, representation, is, n, 2, 1, in, group, theory, there, are, no, color, singlet, gluons, because, quantum, chromodynamics, has, an, su, 3, rather, than, a, u, 3, symmetry, there, is, no, known, a, priori, reason, for, one, group, to, be, preferred, over, the, other, but, as, discussed, above, the, experimental, evidence, supports, su, 3, if, the, group, were, u, 3, the, ninth, colorless, singlet, gluon, would, behave, like, a, second, photon, and, not, like, the, other, eight, gluons, since, gluons, themselves, carry, color, charge, they, participate, in, strong, interactions, these, gluon, gluon, interactions, constrain, color, fields, to, string, like, objects, called, flux, tubes, which, exert, constant, force, when, stretched, due, to, this, force, quarks, are, confined, within, composite, particles, called, hadrons, this, effectively, limits, the, range, of, the, strong, interaction, to, 1, 10, 15, meters, roughly, the, size, of, a, nucleon, beyond, a, certain, distance, the, energy, of, the, flux, tube, binding, two, quarks, increases, linearly, at, a, large, enough, distance, it, becomes, energetically, more, favorable, to, pull, a, quark, antiquark, pair, out, of, the, vacuum, rather, than, increase, the, length, of, the, flux, tube, one, consequence, of, the, hadron, confinement, property, of, gluons, is, that, they, are, not, directly, involved, in, the, nuclear, forces, between, hadrons, the, force, mediators, for, these, are, other, hadrons, called, mesons, although, in, the, normal, phase, of, qcd, single, gluons, may, not, travel, freely, it, is, predicted, that, there, exist, hadrons, that, are, formed, entirely, of, gluons, called, glueballs, there, are, also, conjectures, about, other, exotic, hadrons, in, which, real, gluons, as, opposed, to, virtual, ones, found, in, ordinary, hadrons, would, be, primary, constituents, beyond, the, normal, phase, of, qcd, at, extreme, temperatures, and, pressures, quark, gluon, plasma, forms, in, such, a, plasma, there, are, no, hadrons, quarks, and, gluons, become, free, particles, quarks, and, gluons, colored, manifest, themselves, by, fragmenting, into, more, quarks, and, gluons, which, in, turn, hadronize, into, normal, colorless, particles, correlated, in, jets, as, revealed, in, 1978, summer, conferences, the, pluto, detector, at, the, electron, positron, collider, doris, desy, produced, the, first, evidence, that, the, hadronic, decays, of, the, very, narrow, resonance, 9, 46, could, be, interpreted, as, three, jet, event, topologies, produced, by, three, gluons, later, published, analyses, by, the, same, experiment, confirmed, this, interpretation, and, also, the, spin, 1, nature, of, the, gluon, see, also, the, recollection, and, pluto, experiments, in, summer, 1979, at, higher, energies, at, the, electron, positron, collider, petra, desy, again, three, jet, topologies, were, observed, now, clearly, visible, and, interpreted, as, q, q, gluon, bremsstrahlung, by, tasso, mark, j, and, pluto, experiments, later, in, 1980, also, by, jade, the, spin, 1, property, of, the, gluon, was, confirmed, in, 1980, by, tasso, and, pluto, experiments, see, also, the, review, in, 1991, a, subsequent, experiment, at, the, lep, storage, ring, at, cern, again, confirmed, this, result, the, gluons, play, an, important, role, in, the, elementary, strong, interactions, between, quarks, and, gluons, described, by, qcd, and, studied, particularly, at, the, electron, proton, collider, hera, at, desy, the, number, and, momentum, distribution, of, the, gluons, in, the, proton, gluon, density, have, been, measured, by, two, experiments, h1, and, zeus, in, the, years, 1996, 2007, the, gluon, contribution, to, the, proton, spin, has, been, studied, by, the, hermes, experiment, at, hera, the, gluon, density, in, the, proton, when, behaving, hadronically, also, has, been, measured, color, confinement, is, verified, by, the, failure, of, free, quark, searches, searches, of, fractional, charges, quarks, are, normally, produced, in, pairs, quark, antiquark, to, compensate, the, quantum, color, and, flavor, numbers, however, at, fermilab, single, production, of, top, quarks, has, been, shown, no, glueball, has, been, demonstrated, deconfinement, was, claimed, in, 2000, at, cern, sps, in, heavy, ion, collisions, and, it, implies, a, new, state, of, matter, quark, gluon, plasma, less, interactive, than, in, the, nucleus, almost, as, in, a, liquid, it, was, found, at, the, relativistic, heavy, ion, collider, rhic, at, brookhaven, in, the, years, 2004, 2010, by, four, contemporaneous, experiments, a, quark, gluon, plasma, state, has, been, confirmed, at, the, cern, large, hadron, collider, lhc, by, the, three, experiments, alice, atlas, and, cms, in, 2010, jefferson, lab, s, continuous, electron, beam, accelerator, facility, in, newport, news, virginia, is, one, of, 10, department, of, energy, facilities, doing, research, on, gluons, the, virginia, lab, was, competing, with, another, facility, brookhaven, national, laboratory, on, long, island, new, york, for, funds, to, build, a, new, electron, ion, collider, in, december, 2019, the, us, department, of, energy, selected, the, brookhaven, national, laboratory, to, host, the, electron, ion, collider
