a, geosynchronous, orbit, sometimes, abbreviated, gso, is, an, earth, centered, orbit, with, an, orbital, period, that, matches, earth, s, rotation, on, its, axis, 23, hours, 56, minutes, and, 4, seconds, one, sidereal, day, the, synchronization, of, rotation, and, orbital, period, means, that, for, an, observer, on, earth, s, surface, an, object, in, geosynchronous, orbit, returns, to, exactly, the, same, position, in, the, sky, after, a, period, of, one, sidereal, day, over, the, course, of, a, day, the, object, s, position, in, the, sky, may, remain, still, or, trace, out, a, path, typically, in, a, figure, 8, form, whose, precise, characteristics, depend, on, the, orbit, s, inclination, and, eccentricity, a, circular, geosynchronous, orbit, has, a, constant, altitude, of, 35, 786, km, 22, 236, mi, a, special, case, of, geosynchronous, orbit, is, the, geostationary, orbit, often, abbreviated, geo, which, is, a, circular, geosynchronous, orbit, in, earth, s, equatorial, plane, with, both, inclination, and, eccentricity, equal, to, 0, a, satellite, in, a, geostationary, orbit, remains, in, the, same, position, in, the, sky, to, observers, on, the, surface, communications, satellites, are, often, given, geostationary, or, close, to, geostationary, orbits, so, that, the, satellite, antennas, that, communicate, with, them, do, not, have, to, move, but, can, be, pointed, permanently, at, the, fixed, location, in, the, sky, where, the, satellite, appears, in, 1929, herman, poto, nik, described, both, geosynchronous, orbits, in, general, and, the, special, case, of, the, geostationary, earth, orbit, in, particular, as, useful, orbits, for, space, stations, the, first, appearance, of, a, geosynchronous, orbit, in, popular, literature, was, in, october, 1942, in, the, first, venus, equilateral, story, by, george, o, smith, but, smith, did, not, go, into, details, british, science, fiction, author, arthur, c, clarke, popularised, and, expanded, the, concept, in, a, 1945, paper, entitled, extra, terrestrial, relays, can, rocket, stations, give, worldwide, radio, coverage, published, in, wireless, world, magazine, clarke, acknowledged, the, connection, in, his, introduction, to, the, complete, venus, equilateral, the, orbit, which, clarke, first, described, as, useful, for, broadcast, and, relay, communications, satellites, is, sometimes, called, the, clarke, orbit, similarly, the, collection, of, artificial, satellites, in, this, orbit, is, known, as, the, clarke, belt, in, technical, terminology, the, geosynchronous, orbits, are, often, referred, to, as, geostationary, if, they, are, roughly, over, the, equator, but, the, terms, are, used, somewhat, interchangeably, specifically, geosynchronous, earth, orbit, geo, may, be, a, synonym, for, geosynchronous, equatorial, orbit, or, geostationary, earth, orbit, the, first, geosynchronous, satellite, was, designed, by, harold, rosen, while, he, was, working, at, hughes, aircraft, in, 1959, inspired, by, sputnik, 1, he, wanted, to, use, a, geostationary, geosynchronous, equatorial, satellite, to, globalise, communications, telecommunications, between, the, us, and, europe, was, then, possible, between, just, 136, people, at, a, time, and, reliant, on, high, frequency, radios, and, an, undersea, cable, conventional, wisdom, at, the, time, was, that, it, would, require, too, much, rocket, power, to, place, a, satellite, in, a, geosynchronous, orbit, and, it, would, not, survive, long, enough, to, justify, the, expense, so, early, efforts, were, put, towards, constellations, of, satellites, in, low, or, medium, earth, orbit, the, first, of, these, were, the, passive, echo, balloon, satellites, in, 1960, followed, by, telstar, 1, in, 1962, although, these, projects, had, difficulties, with, signal, strength, and, tracking, that, could, be, solved, through, geosynchronous, satellites, the, concept, was, seen, as, impractical, so, hughes, often, withheld, funds, and, support, by, 1961, rosen, and, his, team, had, produced, a, cylindrical, prototype, with, a, diameter, of, 76, centimetres, 30, in, height, of, 38, centimetres, 15, in, weighing, 11, 3, kilograms, 25, lb, it, was, light, and, small, enough, to, be, placed, into, orbit, by, then, available, rocketry, was, spin, stabilised, and, used, dipole, antennas, producing, a, pancake, shaped, waveform, in, august, 1961, they, were, contracted, to, begin, building, the, working, satellite, they, lost, syncom, 1, to, electronics, failure, but, syncom, 2, was, successfully, placed, into, a, geosynchronous, orbit, in, 1963, although, its, inclined, orbit, still, required, moving, antennas, it, was, able, to, relay, tv, transmissions, and, allowed, for, us, president, john, f, kennedy, to, phone, nigerian, prime, minister, abubakar, tafawa, balewa, from, a, ship, on, august, 23, 1963, today, there, are, hundreds, of, geosynchronous, satellites, providing, remote, sensing, navigation, and, communications, although, most, populated, land, locations, on, the, planet, now, have, terrestrial, communications, facilities, microwave, fiber, optic, which, often, have, latency, and, bandwidth, advantages, and, telephone, access, covering, 96, of, the, population, and, internet, access, 90, as, of, 2018, some, rural, and, remote, areas, in, developed, countries, are, still, reliant, on, satellite, communications, a, geostationary, equatorial, orbit, geo, is, a, circular, geosynchronous, orbit, in, the, plane, of, the, earth, s, equator, with, a, radius, of, approximately, 42, 164, km, 26, 199, mi, measured, from, the, center, of, the, earth, 156, a, satellite, in, such, an, orbit, is, at, an, altitude, of, approximately, 35, 786, km, 22, 236, mi, above, mean, sea, level, it, maintains, the, same, position, relative, to, the, earth, s, surface, if, one, could, see, a, satellite, in, geostationary, orbit, it, would, appear, to, hover, at, the, same, point, in, the, sky, i, e, not, exhibit, diurnal, motion, while, the, sun, moon, and, stars, would, traverse, the, skies, behind, it, such, orbits, are, useful, for, telecommunications, satellites, a, perfectly, stable, geostationary, orbit, is, an, ideal, that, can, only, be, approximated, in, practice, the, satellite, drifts, out, of, this, orbit, because, of, perturbations, such, as, the, solar, wind, radiation, pressure, variations, in, the, earth, s, gravitational, field, and, the, gravitational, effect, of, the, moon, and, sun, and, thrusters, are, used, to, maintain, the, orbit, in, a, process, known, as, station, keeping, 156, eventually, without, the, use, of, thrusters, the, orbit, will, become, inclined, oscillating, between, 0, and, 15, every, 55, years, at, the, end, of, the, satellite, s, lifetime, when, fuel, approaches, depletion, satellite, operators, may, decide, to, omit, these, expensive, manoeuvres, to, correct, inclination, and, only, control, eccentricity, this, prolongs, the, life, time, of, the, satellite, as, it, consumes, less, fuel, over, time, but, the, satellite, can, then, only, be, used, by, ground, antennas, capable, of, following, the, n, s, movement, 156, geostationary, satellites, will, also, tend, to, drift, around, one, of, two, stable, longitudes, of, 75, and, 255, without, station, keeping, 157, many, objects, in, geosynchronous, orbits, have, eccentric, and, or, inclined, orbits, eccentricity, makes, the, orbit, elliptical, and, appear, to, oscillate, e, w, in, the, sky, from, the, viewpoint, of, a, ground, station, while, inclination, tilts, the, orbit, compared, to, the, equator, and, makes, it, appear, to, oscillate, n, s, from, a, groundstation, these, effects, combine, to, form, an, analemma, figure, 8, 122, satellites, in, elliptical, eccentric, orbits, must, be, tracked, by, steerable, ground, stations, 122, the, tundra, orbit, is, an, eccentric, geosynchronous, orbit, which, allows, the, satellite, to, spend, most, of, its, time, dwelling, over, one, high, latitude, location, it, sits, at, an, inclination, of, 63, 4, which, is, a, frozen, orbit, which, reduces, the, need, for, stationkeeping, at, least, two, satellites, are, needed, to, provide, continuous, coverage, over, an, area, it, was, used, by, the, sirius, xm, satellite, radio, to, improve, signal, strength, in, the, northern, us, and, canada, the, quasi, zenith, satellite, system, qzss, is, a, four, satellite, system, that, operates, in, a, geosynchronous, orbit, at, an, inclination, of, 42, and, a, 0, 075, eccentricity, each, satellite, dwells, over, japan, allowing, signals, to, reach, receivers, in, urban, canyons, then, passes, quickly, over, australia, geosynchronous, satellites, are, launched, to, the, east, into, a, prograde, orbit, that, matches, the, rotation, rate, of, the, equator, the, smallest, inclination, that, a, satellite, can, be, launched, into, is, that, of, the, launch, site, s, latitude, so, launching, the, satellite, from, close, to, the, equator, limits, the, amount, of, inclination, change, needed, later, additionally, launching, from, close, to, the, equator, allows, the, speed, of, the, earth, s, rotation, to, give, the, satellite, a, boost, a, launch, site, should, have, water, or, deserts, to, the, east, so, any, failed, rockets, do, not, fall, on, a, populated, area, most, launch, vehicles, place, geosynchronous, satellites, directly, into, a, geosynchronous, transfer, orbit, gto, an, elliptical, orbit, with, an, apogee, at, gso, height, and, a, low, perigee, on, board, satellite, propulsion, is, then, used, to, raise, the, perigee, circularise, and, reach, gso, once, in, a, viable, geostationary, orbit, spacecraft, can, change, their, longitudinal, position, by, adjusting, their, semi, major, axis, such, that, the, new, period, is, shorter, or, longer, than, a, sidereal, day, in, order, to, effect, an, apparent, drift, eastward, or, westward, respectively, once, at, the, desired, longitude, the, spacecraft, s, period, is, restored, to, geosynchronous, a, statite, is, a, hypothetical, satellite, that, uses, radiation, pressure, from, the, sun, against, a, solar, sail, to, modify, its, orbit, it, would, hold, its, location, over, the, dark, side, of, the, earth, at, a, latitude, of, approximately, 30, degrees, it, would, return, to, the, same, spot, in, the, sky, every, 24, hours, from, an, earth, based, viewer, s, perspective, so, be, functionally, similar, to, a, geosynchronous, orbit, a, further, form, of, geosynchronous, orbit, is, the, theoretical, space, elevator, when, one, end, is, attached, to, the, ground, for, altitudes, below, the, geostationary, belt, the, elevator, maintains, a, shorter, orbital, period, than, by, gravity, alone, geosynchronous, satellites, require, some, station, keeping, in, order, to, remain, in, position, and, once, they, run, out, of, thruster, fuel, and, are, no, longer, useful, they, are, moved, into, a, higher, graveyard, orbit, it, is, not, feasible, to, deorbit, geosynchronous, satellites, for, to, do, so, would, take, far, more, fuel, than, would, be, used, by, slightly, elevating, the, orbit, and, atmospheric, drag, is, negligible, giving, gsos, lifetimes, of, thousands, of, years, the, retirement, process, is, becoming, increasingly, regulated, and, satellites, must, have, a, 90, chance, of, moving, over, 200, km, above, the, geostationary, belt, at, end, of, life, space, debris, in, geosynchronous, orbits, typically, has, a, lower, collision, speed, than, at, leo, since, most, gso, satellites, orbit, in, the, same, plane, altitude, and, speed, however, the, presence, of, satellites, in, eccentric, orbits, allows, for, collisions, at, up, to, 4, km, s, although, a, collision, is, comparatively, unlikely, gso, satellites, have, a, limited, ability, to, avoid, any, debris, debris, less, than, 10, cm, in, diameter, cannot, be, seen, from, the, earth, making, it, difficult, to, assess, their, prevalence, despite, efforts, to, reduce, risk, spacecraft, collisions, have, occurred, the, european, space, agency, telecom, satellite, olympus, 1, was, struck, by, a, meteoroid, on, august, 11, 1993, and, eventually, moved, to, a, graveyard, orbit, and, in, 2006, the, russian, express, am11, communications, satellite, was, struck, by, an, unknown, object, and, rendered, inoperable, although, its, engineers, had, enough, contact, time, with, the, satellite, to, send, it, into, a, graveyard, orbit, in, 2017, both, amc, 9, and, telkom, 1, broke, apart, from, an, unknown, cause, a, geosynchronous, orbit, has, the, following, properties, all, geosynchronous, orbits, have, an, orbital, period, equal, to, exactly, one, sidereal, day, this, means, that, the, satellite, will, return, to, the, same, point, above, the, earth, s, surface, every, sidereal, day, regardless, of, other, orbital, properties, 121, this, orbital, period, t, is, directly, related, to, the, semi, major, axis, of, the, orbit, through, the, formula, where, a, geosynchronous, orbit, can, have, any, inclination, satellites, commonly, have, an, inclination, of, zero, ensuring, that, the, orbit, remains, over, the, equator, at, all, times, making, it, stationary, with, respect, to, latitude, from, the, point, of, view, of, a, ground, observer, and, in, the, ecef, reference, frame, 122, another, popular, inclinations, is, 63, 4, for, a, tundra, orbit, which, ensures, that, the, orbit, s, argument, of, perigee, does, not, change, over, time, in, the, special, case, of, a, geostationary, orbit, the, ground, track, of, a, satellite, is, a, single, point, on, the, equator, in, the, general, case, of, a, geosynchronous, orbit, with, a, non, zero, inclination, or, eccentricity, the, ground, track, is, a, more, or, less, distorted, figure, eight, returning, to, the, same, places, once, per, sidereal, day, 122
