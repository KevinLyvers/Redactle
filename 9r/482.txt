a, silicate, is, any, member, of, a, family, of, polyatomic, anions, consisting, of, silicon, and, oxygen, usually, with, the, general, formula, n, where, 0, x, 2, the, family, includes, orthosilicate, sio, 4, 4, x, 0, metasilicate, sio, 2, 3, x, 1, and, pyrosilicate, si, 2, o, 6, 7, x, 0, 5, n, 2, the, name, is, also, used, for, any, salt, of, such, anions, such, as, sodium, metasilicate, or, any, ester, containing, the, corresponding, chemical, group, such, as, tetramethyl, orthosilicate, the, name, silicate, is, sometimes, extended, to, any, anions, containing, silicon, even, if, they, do, not, fit, the, general, formula, or, contain, other, atoms, besides, oxygen, such, as, hexafluorosilicate, 2, most, commonly, silicates, are, encountered, as, silicate, minerals, for, diverse, manufacturing, technological, and, artistic, needs, silicates, are, versatile, materials, both, natural, such, as, granite, gravel, and, garnet, and, artificial, such, as, portland, cement, ceramics, glass, and, waterglass, in, most, silicates, silicon, atom, occupies, the, center, of, an, idealized, tetrahedron, whose, corners, are, four, oxygen, atoms, connected, to, it, by, single, covalent, bonds, according, to, the, octet, rule, the, oxygen, atoms, which, bears, some, negative, charge, link, to, other, cations, m, n, this, si, o, m, o, si, linkage, is, strong, and, rigid, which, properties, are, manifested, in, the, rock, like, silicates, the, silicates, can, be, classified, according, to, the, length, and, crosslinking, of, the, silicate, anions, isolated, orthosilicate, anions, have, the, formula, sio, 4, 4, a, common, mineral, in, this, group, is, olivine, mg, fe, 2, sio, 4, two, or, more, silicon, atoms, can, share, oxygen, atoms, in, various, ways, to, form, more, complex, anions, such, as, pyrosilicate, si, 2, o, 6, 7, with, two, shared, oxides, bound, to, each, silicon, cyclic, or, polymeric, structures, can, result, the, cyclic, metasilicate, ring, si, 6, o, 12, 18, is, a, hexamer, of, sio, 3, 2, polymeric, silicate, anions, of, can, exist, also, as, long, chains, in, single, chain, silicates, which, are, a, type, of, inosilicate, tetrahedra, link, to, form, a, chain, by, sharing, two, oxygen, atoms, each, a, common, mineral, in, this, group, is, pyroxene, double, chain, silicates, the, other, category, of, inosilicates, occur, when, tetrahedra, form, a, double, chain, not, always, but, mostly, by, sharing, two, or, three, oxygen, atoms, each, common, minerals, for, this, group, are, amphiboles, in, this, group, known, as, phyllosilicates, tetrahedra, all, share, three, oxygen, atoms, each, and, in, turn, link, to, form, two, dimensional, sheets, this, structure, does, lead, to, minerals, in, this, group, having, one, strong, cleavage, plane, micas, fall, into, this, group, both, muscovite, and, biotite, have, very, weak, layers, that, can, be, peeled, off, in, sheets, in, a, framework, silicate, known, as, a, tectosilicate, each, tetrahedron, shares, all, 4, oxygen, atoms, with, its, neighbours, forming, a, 3d, structure, quartz, and, feldspars, are, in, this, group, although, the, tetrahedron, is, a, common, coordination, geometry, for, silicon, iv, compounds, silicon, may, also, occur, with, higher, coordination, numbers, for, example, in, the, anion, hexafluorosilicate, sif, 2, 6, the, silicon, atom, is, surrounded, by, six, fluorine, atoms, in, an, octahedral, arrangement, this, structure, is, also, seen, in, the, hexahydroxysilicate, anion, si, oh, 2, 6, that, occurs, in, thaumasite, a, mineral, found, rarely, in, nature, but, sometimes, observed, among, other, calcium, silicate, hydrates, artificially, formed, in, cement, and, concrete, structures, submitted, to, a, severe, sulfate, attack, in, argillaceous, grounds, containing, oxidized, pyrite, at, very, high, pressure, such, as, exists, in, the, majority, of, the, earth, s, crust, even, sio, 2, adopts, the, six, coordinated, octahedral, geometry, in, the, mineral, stishovite, a, dense, polymorph, of, silica, found, in, the, lower, mantle, of, the, earth, and, also, formed, by, shock, during, meteorite, impacts, silicates, with, alkali, cations, and, small, or, chain, like, anions, such, as, sodium, ortho, and, metasilicate, are, fairly, soluble, in, water, they, form, several, solid, hydrates, when, crystallized, from, solution, soluble, sodium, silicates, and, mixtures, thereof, known, as, waterglass, are, important, industrial, and, household, chemicals, silicates, of, non, alkali, cations, or, with, sheet, and, tridimensional, polymeric, anions, generally, have, negligible, solubility, in, water, at, normal, conditions, silicates, are, generally, inert, chemically, hence, they, are, common, minerals, their, resiliency, also, recommends, their, use, as, building, materials, when, treated, with, calcium, oxides, and, water, silicate, minerals, form, portland, cement, equilibria, involving, hydrolysis, of, silicate, minerals, are, difficult, to, study, the, chief, challenge, is, the, very, low, solubility, of, sio, 4, 4, and, its, various, protonated, forms, such, equilibria, are, relevant, to, the, processes, occurring, on, geological, time, scales, some, plants, excrete, ligands, that, dissolve, silicates, a, step, in, biomineralization, silicate, anions, in, solution, react, with, molybdate, anions, yielding, yellow, silicomolybdate, complexes, in, a, typical, preparation, monomeric, orthosilicate, was, found, to, react, completely, in, 75, seconds, dimeric, pyrosilicate, in, 10, minutes, and, higher, oligomers, in, considerably, longer, time, in, particular, the, reaction, is, not, observed, with, suspensions, of, colloidal, silica, the, nature, of, soluble, silicates, is, relevant, to, understanding, biomineralization, and, the, synthesis, of, aluminosilicates, such, as, the, industrially, important, catalysts, called, zeolites, along, with, aluminate, anions, soluble, silicate, anions, also, play, a, major, role, in, the, polymerization, mechanism, of, geopolymers, geopolymers, are, amorphous, aluminosilicates, whose, production, requires, less, energy, than, that, of, ordinary, portland, cement, so, geopolymer, cements, could, contribute, to, limiting, the, co, 2, emissions, in, the, earth, atmosphere, and, the, global, warming, caused, by, this, greenhouse, gas
