a, giant, star, has, a, substantially, larger, radius, and, luminosity, than, a, main, sequence, or, dwarf, star, of, the, same, surface, temperature, they, lie, above, the, main, sequence, luminosity, class, v, in, the, yerkes, spectral, classification, on, the, hertzsprung, russell, diagram, and, correspond, to, luminosity, classes, ii, and, iii, the, terms, giant, and, dwarf, were, coined, for, stars, of, quite, different, luminosity, despite, similar, temperature, or, spectral, type, namely, k, and, m, by, ejnar, hertzsprung, in, 1905, or, 1906, giant, stars, have, radii, up, to, a, few, hundred, times, the, sun, and, luminosities, between, 10, and, a, few, thousand, times, that, of, the, sun, stars, still, more, luminous, than, giants, are, referred, to, as, supergiants, and, hypergiants, a, hot, luminous, main, sequence, star, may, also, be, referred, to, as, a, giant, but, any, main, sequence, star, is, properly, called, a, dwarf, regardless, of, how, large, and, luminous, it, is, a, star, becomes, a, giant, after, all, the, hydrogen, available, for, fusion, at, its, core, has, been, depleted, and, as, a, result, leaves, the, main, sequence, the, behaviour, of, a, post, main, sequence, star, depends, largely, on, its, mass, for, a, star, with, a, mass, above, about, 0, 25, solar, masses, m, once, the, core, is, depleted, of, hydrogen, it, contracts, and, heats, up, so, that, hydrogen, starts, to, fuse, in, a, shell, around, the, core, the, portion, of, the, star, outside, the, shell, expands, and, cools, but, with, only, a, small, increase, in, luminosity, and, the, star, becomes, a, subgiant, the, inert, helium, core, continues, to, grow, and, increase, in, temperature, as, it, accretes, helium, from, the, shell, but, in, stars, up, to, about, 10, 12, m, it, does, not, become, hot, enough, to, start, helium, burning, higher, mass, stars, are, supergiants, and, evolve, differently, instead, after, just, a, few, million, years, the, core, reaches, the, sch, nberg, chandrasekhar, limit, rapidly, collapses, and, may, become, degenerate, this, causes, the, outer, layers, to, expand, even, further, and, generates, a, strong, convective, zone, that, brings, heavy, elements, to, the, surface, in, a, process, called, the, first, dredge, up, this, strong, convection, also, increases, the, transport, of, energy, to, the, surface, the, luminosity, increases, dramatically, and, the, star, moves, onto, the, red, giant, branch, where, it, will, stably, burn, hydrogen, in, a, shell, for, a, substantial, fraction, of, its, entire, life, roughly, 10, for, a, sun, like, star, the, core, continues, to, gain, mass, contract, and, increase, in, temperature, whereas, there, is, some, mass, loss, in, the, outer, layers, 5, 9, if, the, star, s, mass, when, on, the, main, sequence, was, below, approximately, 0, 4, m, it, will, never, reach, the, central, temperatures, necessary, to, fuse, helium, p, 169, it, will, therefore, remain, a, hydrogen, fusing, red, giant, until, it, runs, out, of, hydrogen, at, which, point, it, will, become, a, helium, white, dwarf, 4, 1, 6, 1, according, to, stellar, evolution, theory, no, star, of, such, low, mass, can, have, evolved, to, that, stage, within, the, age, of, the, universe, in, stars, above, about, 0, 4, m, the, core, temperature, eventually, reaches, 10, 8, k, and, helium, will, begin, to, fuse, to, carbon, and, oxygen, in, the, core, by, the, triple, alpha, process, 5, 9, chapter, 6, when, the, core, is, degenerate, helium, fusion, begins, explosively, but, most, of, the, energy, goes, into, lifting, the, degeneracy, and, the, core, becomes, convective, the, energy, generated, by, helium, fusion, reduces, the, pressure, in, the, surrounding, hydrogen, burning, shell, which, reduces, its, energy, generation, rate, the, overall, luminosity, of, the, star, decreases, its, outer, envelope, contracts, again, and, the, star, moves, from, the, red, giant, branch, to, the, horizontal, branch, chapter, 6, when, the, core, helium, is, exhausted, a, star, with, up, to, about, 8, m, has, a, carbon, oxygen, core, that, becomes, degenerate, and, starts, helium, burning, in, a, shell, as, with, the, earlier, collapse, of, the, helium, core, this, starts, convection, in, the, outer, layers, triggers, a, second, dredge, up, and, causes, a, dramatic, increase, in, size, and, luminosity, this, is, the, asymptotic, giant, branch, agb, analogous, to, the, red, giant, branch, but, more, luminous, with, a, hydrogen, burning, shell, contributing, most, of, the, energy, stars, only, remain, on, the, agb, for, around, a, million, years, becoming, increasingly, unstable, until, they, exhaust, their, fuel, go, through, a, planetary, nebula, phase, and, then, become, a, carbon, oxygen, white, dwarf, 7, 1, 7, 4, main, sequence, stars, with, masses, above, about, 12, m, are, already, very, luminous, and, they, move, horizontally, across, the, hr, diagram, when, they, leave, the, main, sequence, briefly, becoming, blue, giants, before, they, expand, further, into, blue, supergiants, they, start, core, helium, burning, before, the, core, becomes, degenerate, and, develop, smoothly, into, red, supergiants, without, a, strong, increase, in, luminosity, at, this, stage, they, have, comparable, luminosities, to, bright, agb, stars, although, they, have, much, higher, masses, but, will, further, increase, in, luminosity, as, they, burn, heavier, elements, and, eventually, become, a, supernova, stars, in, the, 8, 12, m, range, have, somewhat, intermediate, properties, and, have, been, called, super, agb, stars, they, largely, follow, the, tracks, of, lighter, stars, through, rgb, hb, and, agb, phases, but, are, massive, enough, to, initiate, core, carbon, burning, and, even, some, neon, burning, they, form, oxygen, magnesium, neon, cores, which, may, collapse, in, an, electron, capture, supernova, or, they, may, leave, behind, an, oxygen, neon, white, dwarf, o, class, main, sequence, stars, are, already, highly, luminous, the, giant, phase, for, such, stars, is, a, brief, phase, of, slightly, increased, size, and, luminosity, before, developing, a, supergiant, spectral, luminosity, class, type, o, giants, may, be, more, than, a, hundred, thousand, times, as, luminous, as, the, sun, brighter, than, many, supergiants, classification, is, complex, and, difficult, with, small, differences, between, luminosity, classes, and, a, continuous, range, of, intermediate, forms, the, most, massive, stars, develop, giant, or, supergiant, spectral, features, while, still, burning, hydrogen, in, their, cores, due, to, mixing, of, heavy, elements, to, the, surface, and, high, luminosity, which, produces, a, powerful, stellar, wind, and, causes, the, star, s, atmosphere, to, expand, a, star, whose, initial, mass, is, less, than, approximately, 0, 25, m, will, not, become, a, giant, star, at, all, for, most, of, their, lifetimes, such, stars, have, their, interior, thoroughly, mixed, by, convection, and, so, they, can, continue, fusing, hydrogen, for, a, time, in, excess, of, 10, 12, years, much, longer, than, the, current, age, of, the, universe, they, steadily, become, hotter, and, more, luminous, throughout, this, time, eventually, they, do, develop, a, radiative, core, subsequently, exhausting, hydrogen, in, the, core, and, burning, hydrogen, in, a, shell, surrounding, the, core, stars, with, a, mass, in, excess, of, 0, 16, m, may, expand, at, this, point, but, will, never, become, very, large, shortly, thereafter, the, star, s, supply, of, hydrogen, will, be, completely, exhausted, and, it, is, expected, to, become, a, helium, white, dwarf, although, the, universe, is, too, young, for, any, such, star, to, exist, yet, so, no, star, with, that, history, has, ever, been, observed, there, are, a, wide, range, of, giant, class, stars, and, several, subdivisions, are, commonly, used, to, identify, smaller, groups, of, stars, subgiants, are, an, entirely, separate, spectroscopic, luminosity, class, iv, from, giants, but, share, many, features, with, them, although, some, subgiants, are, simply, over, luminous, main, sequence, stars, due, to, chemical, variation, or, age, others, are, a, distinct, evolutionary, track, towards, true, giants, examples, bright, giants, are, stars, of, luminosity, class, ii, in, the, yerkes, spectral, classification, these, are, stars, which, straddle, the, boundary, between, ordinary, giants, and, supergiants, based, on, the, appearance, of, their, spectra, the, bright, giant, luminosity, class, was, first, defined, in, 1943, well, known, stars, which, are, classified, as, bright, giants, include, within, any, giant, luminosity, class, the, cooler, stars, of, spectral, class, k, m, s, and, c, and, sometimes, some, g, type, stars, are, called, red, giants, red, giants, include, stars, in, a, number, of, distinct, evolutionary, phases, of, their, lives, a, main, red, giant, branch, rgb, a, red, horizontal, branch, or, red, clump, the, asymptotic, giant, branch, agb, although, agb, stars, are, often, large, enough, and, luminous, enough, to, get, classified, as, supergiants, and, sometimes, other, large, cool, stars, such, as, immediate, post, agb, stars, the, rgb, stars, are, by, far, the, most, common, type, of, giant, star, due, to, their, moderate, mass, relatively, long, stable, lives, and, luminosity, they, are, the, most, obvious, grouping, of, stars, after, the, main, sequence, on, most, hr, diagrams, although, white, dwarfs, are, more, numerous, but, far, less, luminous, examples, giant, stars, with, intermediate, temperatures, spectral, class, g, f, and, at, least, some, a, are, called, yellow, giants, they, are, far, less, numerous, than, red, giants, partly, because, they, only, form, from, stars, with, somewhat, higher, masses, and, partly, because, they, spend, less, time, in, that, phase, of, their, lives, however, they, include, a, number, of, important, classes, of, variable, stars, high, luminosity, yellow, stars, are, generally, unstable, leading, to, the, instability, strip, on, the, hr, diagram, where, the, majority, of, stars, are, pulsating, variables, the, instability, strip, reaches, from, the, main, sequence, up, to, hypergiant, luminosities, but, at, the, luminosities, of, giants, there, are, several, classes, of, pulsating, variable, stars, yellow, giants, may, be, moderate, mass, stars, evolving, for, the, first, time, towards, the, red, giant, branch, or, they, may, be, more, evolved, stars, on, the, horizontal, branch, evolution, towards, the, red, giant, branch, for, the, first, time, is, very, rapid, whereas, stars, can, spend, much, longer, on, the, horizontal, branch, horizontal, branch, stars, with, more, heavy, elements, and, lower, mass, are, more, unstable, examples, the, hottest, giants, of, spectral, classes, o, b, and, sometimes, early, a, are, called, blue, giants, sometimes, a, and, late, b, type, stars, may, be, referred, to, as, white, giants, the, blue, giants, are, a, very, heterogeneous, grouping, ranging, from, high, mass, high, luminosity, stars, just, leaving, the, main, sequence, to, low, mass, horizontal, branch, stars, higher, mass, stars, leave, the, main, sequence, to, become, blue, giants, then, bright, blue, giants, and, then, blue, supergiants, before, expanding, into, red, supergiants, although, at, the, very, highest, masses, the, giant, stage, is, so, brief, and, narrow, that, it, can, hardly, be, distinguished, from, a, blue, supergiant, lower, mass, core, helium, burning, stars, evolve, from, red, giants, along, the, horizontal, branch, and, then, back, again, to, the, asymptotic, giant, branch, and, depending, on, mass, and, metallicity, they, can, become, blue, giants, it, is, thought, that, some, post, agb, stars, experiencing, a, late, thermal, pulse, can, become, peculiar, blue, giants, examples
