a, tropical, cyclone, is, a, rapidly, rotating, storm, system, with, a, low, pressure, center, a, closed, low, level, atmospheric, circulation, strong, winds, and, a, spiral, arrangement, of, thunderstorms, that, produce, heavy, rain, and, squalls, depending, on, its, location, and, strength, a, tropical, cyclone, is, called, a, hurricane, h, r, k, n, k, e, n, typhoon, t, a, f, u, n, tropical, storm, cyclonic, storm, tropical, depression, or, simply, cyclone, a, hurricane, is, a, strong, tropical, cyclone, that, occurs, in, the, atlantic, ocean, or, northeastern, pacific, ocean, a, typhoon, occurs, in, the, northwestern, pacific, ocean, in, the, indian, ocean, and, south, pacific, comparable, storms, are, referred, to, as, tropical, cyclones, in, modern, times, on, average, around, 80, to, 90, named, tropical, cyclones, form, each, year, around, the, world, over, half, of, which, develop, hurricane, force, winds, of, 65, kn, 120, km, h, 75, mph, or, more, tropical, cyclones, typically, form, over, large, bodies, of, relatively, warm, water, they, derive, their, energy, through, the, evaporation, of, water, from, the, ocean, surface, which, ultimately, condenses, into, clouds, and, rain, when, moist, air, rises, and, cools, to, saturation, this, energy, source, differs, from, that, of, mid, latitude, cyclonic, storms, such, as, nor, easters, and, european, windstorms, which, are, powered, primarily, by, horizontal, temperature, contrasts, tropical, cyclones, are, typically, between, 100, and, 2, 000, km, 62, and, 1, 243, mi, in, diameter, the, strong, rotating, winds, of, a, tropical, cyclone, are, a, result, of, the, conservation, of, angular, momentum, imparted, by, the, earth, s, rotation, as, air, flows, inwards, toward, the, axis, of, rotation, as, a, result, cyclones, rarely, form, within, 5, of, the, equator, tropical, cyclones, are, very, rare, in, the, south, atlantic, although, occasional, examples, do, occur, due, to, consistently, strong, wind, shear, and, a, weak, intertropical, convergence, zone, in, contrast, the, african, easterly, jet, and, areas, of, atmospheric, instability, give, rise, to, cyclones, in, the, atlantic, ocean, and, caribbean, sea, heat, energy, from, the, ocean, acts, as, the, accelerator, for, tropical, cyclones, this, causes, inland, regions, to, suffer, far, less, damage, from, cyclones, than, coastal, regions, although, the, impacts, of, flooding, are, felt, across, the, board, coastal, damage, may, be, caused, by, strong, winds, and, rain, high, waves, due, to, winds, storm, surges, due, to, wind, and, severe, pressure, changes, and, the, potential, of, spawning, tornadoes, tropical, cyclones, draw, in, air, from, a, large, area, and, concentrate, the, water, content, of, that, air, into, precipitation, over, a, much, smaller, area, this, replenishing, of, moisture, bearing, air, after, rain, may, cause, multi, hour, or, multi, day, extremely, heavy, rain, up, to, 40, km, 25, mi, from, the, coastline, far, beyond, the, amount, of, water, that, the, local, atmosphere, holds, at, any, one, time, this, in, turn, can, lead, to, river, flooding, overland, flooding, and, a, general, overwhelming, of, local, water, control, structures, across, a, large, area, climate, change, affects, tropical, cyclones, in, several, ways, scientists, found, that, climate, change, can, exacerbate, the, impact, of, tropical, cyclones, by, increasing, their, duration, occurrence, and, intensity, due, to, the, warming, of, ocean, waters, and, intensification, of, the, water, cycle, a, tropical, cyclone, is, the, generic, term, for, a, warm, cored, non, frontal, synoptic, scale, low, pressure, system, over, tropical, or, subtropical, waters, around, the, world, the, systems, generally, have, a, well, defined, center, which, is, surrounded, by, deep, atmospheric, convection, and, a, closed, wind, circulation, at, the, surface, a, tropical, cyclone, is, generally, deemed, to, have, formed, once, mean, surface, winds, in, excess, of, 35, kn, 65, km, h, 40, mph, are, observed, it, is, assumed, at, this, stage, that, a, tropical, cyclone, has, become, self, sustaining, and, can, continue, to, intensify, without, any, help, from, its, environment, depending, on, its, location, and, strength, a, tropical, cyclone, is, referred, to, by, different, names, including, hurricane, typhoon, tropical, storm, cyclonic, storm, tropical, depression, or, simply, cyclone, a, hurricane, is, a, strong, tropical, cyclone, that, occurs, in, the, atlantic, ocean, or, northeastern, pacific, ocean, and, a, typhoon, occurs, in, the, northwestern, pacific, ocean, in, the, indian, ocean, and, south, pacific, comparable, storms, are, referred, to, as, tropical, cyclones, and, such, storms, in, the, indian, ocean, can, also, be, called, severe, cyclonic, storms, tropical, refers, to, the, geographical, origin, of, these, systems, which, form, almost, exclusively, over, tropical, seas, cyclone, refers, to, their, winds, moving, in, a, circle, whirling, round, their, central, clear, eye, with, their, surface, winds, blowing, counterclockwise, in, the, northern, hemisphere, and, clockwise, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, opposite, direction, of, circulation, is, due, to, the, coriolis, effect, tropical, cyclones, tend, to, develop, during, the, summer, but, have, been, noted, in, nearly, every, month, in, most, tropical, cyclone, basins, tropical, cyclones, on, either, side, of, the, equator, generally, have, their, origins, in, the, intertropical, convergence, zone, where, winds, blow, from, either, the, northeast, or, southeast, within, this, broad, area, of, low, pressure, air, is, heated, over, the, warm, tropical, ocean, and, rises, in, discrete, parcels, which, causes, thundery, showers, to, form, these, showers, dissipate, quite, quickly, however, they, can, group, together, into, large, clusters, of, thunderstorms, this, creates, a, flow, of, warm, moist, rapidly, rising, air, which, starts, to, rotate, cyclonically, as, it, interacts, with, the, rotation, of, the, earth, several, factors, are, required, for, these, thunderstorms, to, develop, further, including, sea, surface, temperatures, of, around, 27, c, 81, f, and, low, vertical, wind, shear, surrounding, the, system, atmospheric, instability, high, humidity, in, the, lower, to, middle, levels, of, the, troposphere, enough, coriolis, force, to, develop, a, low, pressure, center, and, a, pre, existing, low, level, focus, or, disturbance, there, is, a, limit, on, tropical, cyclone, intensity, which, is, strongly, related, to, the, water, temperatures, along, its, path, and, upper, level, divergence, an, average, of, 86, tropical, cyclones, of, tropical, storm, intensity, form, annually, worldwide, of, those, 47, reach, strength, higher, than, 119, km, h, 74, mph, and, 20, become, intense, tropical, cyclones, at, least, category, 3, intensity, on, the, saffir, simpson, scale, climate, oscillations, such, as, el, ni, o, southern, oscillation, enso, and, the, madden, julian, oscillation, modulate, the, timing, and, frequency, of, tropical, cyclone, development, rossby, waves, can, aid, in, the, formation, of, a, new, tropical, cyclone, by, disseminating, the, energy, of, an, existing, mature, storm, kelvin,

increased, during, the, 3, days, after, the, majority, of, tropical, cyclones, each, year, form, in, one, of, seven, tropical, cyclone, basins, which, are, monitored, by, a, variety, of, meteorological, services, and, warning, centers, ten, of, these, warning, centers, worldwide, are, designated, as, either, a, regional, specialized, meteorological, centre, or, a, tropical, cyclone, warning, centre, by, the, world, meteorological, organization, s, wmo, tropical, cyclone, programme, these, warning, centers, issue, advisories, which, provide, basic, information, and, cover, a, systems, present, forecast, position, movement, and, intensity, in, their, designated, areas, of, responsibility, meteorological, services, around, the, world, are, generally, responsible, for, issuing, warnings, for, their, own, country, however, there, are, exceptions, as, the, united, states, national, hurricane, center, and, fiji, meteorological, service, issue, alerts, watches, and, warnings, for, various, island, nations, in, their, areas, of, responsibility, the, united, states, joint, typhoon, warning, center, and, fleet, weather, center, also, publicly, issue, warnings,

not, a, major, basin, and, not, an, official, basin, according, to, the, wmo, each, year, on, average, around, 80, to, 90, named, tropical, cyclones, form, around, the, world, of, which, over, half, develop, hurricane, force, winds, of, 65, kn, 120, km, h, 75, mph, or, more, worldwide, tropical, cyclone, activity, peaks, in, late, summer, when, the, difference, between, temperatures, aloft, and, sea, surface, temperatures, is, the, greatest, however, each, particular, basin, has, its, own, seasonal, patterns, on, a, worldwide, scale, may, is, the, least, active, month, while, september, is, the, most, active, month, november, is, the, only, month, in, which, all, the, tropical, cyclone, basins, are, in, season, in, the, northern, atlantic, ocean, a, distinct, cyclone, season, occurs, from, june, 1, to, november, 30, sharply, peaking, from, late, august, through, september, the, statistical, peak, of, the, atlantic, hurricane, season, is, september, 10, the, northeast, pacific, ocean, has, a, broader, period, of, activity, but, in, a, similar, time, frame, to, the, atlantic, the, northwest, pacific, sees, tropical, cyclones, year, round, with, a, minimum, in, february, and, march, and, a, peak, in, early, september, in, the, north, indian, basin, storms, are, most, common, from, april, to, december, with, peaks, in, may, and, november, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, tropical, cyclone, year, begins, on, july, 1, and, runs, all, year, round, encompassing, the, tropical, cyclone, seasons, which, run, from, november, 1, until, the, end, of, april, with, peaks, in, mid, february, to, early, march, of, various, modes, of, variability, in, the, climate, system, el, ni, o, southern, oscillation, has, the, largest, effect, on, tropical, cyclone, activity, most, tropical, cyclones, form, on, the, side, of, the, subtropical, ridge, closer, to, the, equator, then, move, poleward, past, the, ridge, axis, before, recurving, into, the, main, belt, of, the, westerlies, when, the, subtropical, ridge, position, shifts, due, to, el, ni, o, so, will, the, preferred, tropical, cyclone, tracks, areas, west, of, japan, and, korea, tend, to, experience, much, fewer, september, november, tropical, cyclone, impacts, during, el, ni, o, and, neutral, years, during, la, ni, a, years, the, formation, of, tropical, cyclones, along, with, the, subtropical, ridge, position, shifts, westward, across, the, western, pacific, ocean, which, increases, the, landfall, threat, to, china, and, much, greater, intensity, in, the, philippines, the, atlantic, ocean, experiences, depressed, activity, due, to, increased, vertical, wind, shear, across, the, region, during, el, ni, o, years, tropical, cyclones, are, further, influenced, by, the, atlantic, meridional, mode, the, quasi, biennial, oscillation, and, the, madden, julian, oscillation, climate, change, can, affect, tropical, cyclones, in, a, variety, of, ways, an, intensification, of, rainfall, and, wind, speed, a, decrease, in, overall, frequency, an, increase, in, the, frequency, of, very, intense, storms, and, a, poleward, extension, of, where, the, cyclones, reach, maximum, intensity, are, among, the, possible, consequences, of, human, induced, climate, change, tropical, cyclones, use, warm, moist, air, as, their, fuel, as, climate, change, is, warming, ocean, temperatures, there, is, potentially, more, of, this, fuel, available, between, 1979, and, 2017, there, was, a, global, increase, in, the, proportion, of, tropical, cyclones, of, category, 3, and, higher, on, the, saffir, simpson, scale, the, trend, was, most, clear, in, the, north, atlantic, and, in, the, southern, indian, ocean, in, the, north, pacific, tropical, cyclones, have, been, moving, poleward, into, colder, waters, and, there, was, no, increase, in, intensity, over, this, period, with, 2, c, 3, 6, f, warming, a, greater, percentage, 13, of, tropical, cyclones, are, expected, to, reach, category, 4, and, 5, strength, a, 2019, study, indicates, that, climate, change, has, been, driving, the, observed, trend, of, rapid, intensification, of, tropical, cyclones, in, the, atlantic, basin, rapidly, intensifying, cyclones, are, hard, to, forecast, and, therefore, pose, additional, risk, to, coastal, communities, warmer, air, can, hold, more, water, vapor, the, theoretical, maximum, water, vapor, content, is, given, by, the, clausius, clapeyron, relation, which, yields, 7, increase, in, water, vapor, in, the, atmosphere, per, 1, c, 1, 8, f, warming, all, models, that, were, assessed, in, a, 2019, review, paper, show, a, future, increase, of, rainfall, rates, additional, sea, level, rise, will, increase, storm, surge, levels, it, is, plausible, that, extreme, wind, waves, see, an, increase, as, a, consequence, of, changes, in, tropical, cyclones, further, exacerbating, storm, surge, dangers, to, coastal, communities, the, compounding, effects, from, floods, storm, surge, and, terrestrial, flooding, rivers, are, projected, to, increase, due, to, global, warming, there, is, currently, no, consensus, on, how, climate, change, will, affect, the, overall, frequency, of, tropical, cyclones, a, majority, of, climate, models, show, a, decreased, frequency, in, future, projections, for, instance, a, 2020, paper, comparing, nine, high, resolution, climate, models, found, robust, decreases, in, frequency, in, the, southern, indian, ocean, and, the, southern, hemisphere, more, generally, while, finding, mixed, signals, for, northern, hemisphere, tropical, cyclones, observations, have, shown, little, change, in, the, overall, frequency, of, tropical, cyclones, worldwide, with, increased, frequency, in, the, north, atlantic, and, central, pacific, and, significant, decreases, in, the, southern, indian, ocean, and, western, north, pacific, there, has, been, a, poleward, expansion, of, the, latitude, at, which, the, maximum, intensity, of, tropical, cyclones, occurs, which, may, be, associated, with, climate, change, in, the, north, pacific, there, may, also, have, been, an, eastward, expansion, between, 1949, and, 2016, there, was, a, slowdown, in, tropical, cyclone, translation, speeds, it, is, unclear, still, to, what, extent, this, can, be, attributed, to, climate, change, climate, models, do, not, all, show, this, feature, a, study, review, article, published, in, 2021, concluded, that, the, geographic, range, of, tropical, cyclones, will, probably, expand, poleward, in, response, to, climate, warming, of, the, hadley, circulation, tropical, cyclone, intensity, is, based, on, wind, speeds, and, pressure, relationships, between, winds, and, pressure, are, often, used, in, determining, the, intensity, of, a, storm, tropical, cyclone, scales, such, as, the, saffir, simpson, hurricane, wind, scale, and, australia, s, scale, bureau, of, meteorology, only, use, wind, speed, for, determining, the, category, of, a, storm, the, most, intense, storm, on, record, is, typhoon, tip, in, the, northwestern, pacific, ocean, in, 1979, which, reached, a, minimum, pressure, of, 870, hpa, 26, inhg, and, maximum, sustained, wind, speeds, of, 165, kn, 85, m, s, 305, km, h, 190, mph, the, highest, maximum, sustained, wind, speed, ever, recorded, was, 185, kn, 95, m, s, 345, km, h, 215, mph, in, hurricane, patricia, in, 2015, the, most, intense, cyclone, ever, recorded, in, the, western, hemisphere, warm, sea, surface, temperatures, are, required, in, order, for, tropical, cyclones, to, form, and, strengthen, the, commonly, accepted, minimum, temperature, range, for, this, to, occur, is, 26, 27, c, 79, 81, f, however, multiple, studies, have, proposed, a, lower, minimum, of, 25, 5, c, 77, 9, f, higher, sea, surface, temperatures, result, in, faster, intensification, rates, and, sometimes, even, rapid, intensification, high, ocean, heat, content, also, known, as, tropical, cyclone, heat, potential, allows, storms, to, achieve, a, higher, intensity, most, tropical, cyclones, that, experience, rapid, intensification, are, traversing, regions, of, high, ocean, heat, content, rather, than, lower, values, high, ocean, heat, content, values, can, help, to, offset, the, oceanic, cooling, caused, by, the, passage, of, a, tropical, cyclone, limiting, the, effect, this, cooling, has, on, the, storm, faster, moving, systems, are, able, to, intensify, to, higher, intensities, with, lower, ocean, heat, content, values, slower, moving, systems, require, higher, values, of, ocean, heat, content, to, achieve, the, same, intensity, the, passage, of, a, tropical, cyclone, over, the, ocean, causes, the, upper, layers, of, the, ocean, to, cool, substantially, a, process, known, as, upweling, which, can, negatively, influence, subsequent, cyclone, development, this, cooling, is, primarily, caused, by, wind, driven, mixing, of, cold, water, from, deeper, in, the, ocean, with, the, warm, surface, waters, this, effect, results, in, a, negative, feedback, process, that, can, inhibit, further, development, or, lead, to, weakening, additional, cooling, may, come, in, the, form, of, cold, water, from, falling, raindrops, this, is, because, the, atmosphere, is, cooler, at, higher, altitudes, cloud, cover, may, also, play, a, role, in, cooling, the, ocean, by, shielding, the, ocean, surface, from, direct, sunlight, before, and, slightly, after, the, storm, passage, all, these, effects, can, combine, to, produce, a, dramatic, drop, in, sea, surface, temperature, over, a, large, area, in, just, a, few, days, conversely, the, mixing, of, the, sea, can, result, in, heat, being, inserted, in, deeper, waters, with, potential, effects, on, global, climate, vertical, wind, shear, decreases, tropical, cyclone, predicability, with, storms, exhibiting, wide, range, of, responses, in, the, presence, of, shear, wind, shear, often, negatively, affects, tropical, cyclone, intensification, by, displacing, moisture, and, heat, from, a, system, s, center, low, levels, of, vertical, wind, shear, are, most, optimal, for, strengthening, while, stronger, wind, shear, induces, weakening, dry, air, entraining, into, a, tropical, cyclone, s, core, has, a, negative, effect, on, its, development, and, intensity, by, diminishing, atmospheric, convection, and, introducing, asymmetries, in, the, storm, s, structure, symmetric, strong, outflow, leads, to, a, faster, rate, of, intensification, than, observed, in, other, systems, by, mitigating, local, wind, shear, weakening, outflow, is, associated, with, the, weakening, of, rainbands, within, a, tropical, cyclone, tropical, cyclones, may, still, intensify, even, rapidly, in, the, presence, of, moderate, or, strong, wind, shear, depending, on, the, evolution, and, structure, of, the, storm, s, convection, the, size, of, tropical, cyclones, plays, a, role, in, how, quickly, they, intensify, smaller, tropical, cyclones, are, more, prone, to, rapid, intensification, than, larger, ones, the, fujiwhara, effect, which, involves, interaction, between, two, tropical, cyclones, can, weaken, and, ultimately, result, in, the, dissipation, of, the, weaker, of, two, tropical, cyclones, by, reducing, the, organization, of, the, system, s, convection, and, imparting, horizontal, wind, shear, tropical, cyclones, typically, weaken, while, situated, over, a, landmass, because, conditions, are, often, unfavorable, as, a, result, of, the, lack, of, oceanic, forcing, the, brown, ocean, effect, can, allow, a, tropical, cyclone, to, maintain, or, increase, its, intensity, following, landfall, in, cases, where, there, has, been, copious, rainfall, through, the, release, of, latent, heat, from, the, saturated, soil, orographic, lift, can, cause, an, significant, increase, in, the, intensity, of, the, convection, of, a, tropical, cyclone, when, its, eye, moves, over, a, mountain, breaking, the, capped, boundary, layer, that, had, been, restraining, it, jet, streams, can, both, enhance, and, inhibit, tropical, cyclone, intensity, by, influencing, the, storm, s, outflow, as, well, as, vertical, wind, shear, on, occasion, tropical, cyclones, may, undergo, a, process, known, as, rapid, intensification, a, period, in, which, the, maximum, sustained, winds, of, a, tropical, cyclone, increase, by, 30, kn, 56, km, h, 35, mph, or, more, within, 24, hours, similarly, rapid, deepening, in, tropical, cyclones, is, defined, as, a, minimum, sea, surface, pressure, decrease, of, 1, 75, hpa, 0, 052, inhg, per, hour, or, 42, hpa, 1, 2, inhg, within, a, 24, hour, period, explosive, deepening, occurs, when, the, surface, pressure, decreases, by, 2, 5, hpa, 0, 074, inhg, per, hour, for, at, least, 12, hours, or, 5, hpa, 0, 15, inhg, per, hour, for, at, least, 6, hours, for, rapid, intensification, to, occur, several, conditions, must, be, in, place, water, temperatures, must, be, extremely, high, near, or, above, 30, c, 86, f, and, water, of, this, temperature, must, be, sufficiently, deep, such, that, waves, do, not, upwell, cooler, waters, to, the, surface, on, the, other, hand, tropical, cyclone, heat, potential, is, one, of, such, non, conventional, subsurface, oceanographic, parameters, influencing, the, cyclone, intensity, wind, shear, must, be, low, when, wind, shear, is, high, the, convection, and, circulation, in, the, cyclone, will, be, disrupted, usually, an, anticyclone, in, the, upper, layers, of, the, troposphere, above, the, storm, must, be, present, as, well, for, extremely, low, surface, pressures, to, develop, air, must, be, rising, very, rapidly, in, the, eyewall, of, the, storm, and, an, upper, level, anticyclone, helps, channel, this, air, away, from, the, cyclone, efficiently, however, some, cyclones, such, as, hurricane, epsilon, have, rapidly, intensified, despite, relatively, unfavorable, conditions, there, are, a, number, of, ways, a, tropical, cyclone, can, weaken, dissipate, or, lose, its, tropical, characteristics, these, include, making, landfall, moving, over, cooler, water, encountering, dry, air, or, interacting, with, other, weather, systems, however, once, a, system, has, dissipated, or, lost, its, tropical, characteristics, its, remnants, could, regenerate, a, tropical, cyclone, if, environmental, conditions, become, favorable, a, tropical, cyclone, can, dissipate, when, it, moves, over, waters, significantly, cooler, than, 26, 5, c, 79, 7, f, this, will, deprive, the, storm, of, such, tropical, characteristics, as, a, warm, core, with, thunderstorms, near, the, center, so, that, it, becomes, a, remnant, low, pressure, area, remnant, systems, may, persist, for, several, days, before, losing, their, identity, this, dissipation, mechanism, is, most, common, in, the, eastern, north, pacific, weakening, or, dissipation, can, also, occur, if, a, storm, experiences, vertical, wind, shear, which, causes, the, convection, and, heat, engine, to, move, away, from, the, center, this, normally, ceases, the, development, of, a, tropical, cyclone, in, addition, its, interaction, with, the, main, belt, of, the, westerlies, by, means, of, merging, with, a, nearby, frontal, zone, can, cause, tropical, cyclones, to, evolve, into, extratropical, cyclones, this, transition, can, take, 1, 3, days, should, a, tropical, cyclone, make, landfall, or, pass, over, an, island, its, circulation, could, start, to, break, down, especially, if, it, encounters, mountainous, terrain, when, a, system, makes, landfall, on, a, large, landmass, it, is, cut, off, from, its, supply, of, warm, moist, maritime, air, and, starts, to, draw, in, dry, continental, air, this, combined, with, the, increased, friction, over, land, areas, leads, to, the, weakening, and, dissipation, of, the, tropical, cyclone, over, a, mountainous, terrain, a, system, can, quickly, weaken, however, over, flat, areas, it, may, endure, for, two, to, three, days, before, circulation, breaks, down, and, dissipates, over, the, years, there, have, been, a, number, of, techniques, considered, to, try, to, artificially, modify, tropical, cyclones, these, techniques, have, included, using, nuclear, weapons, cooling, the, ocean, with, icebergs, blowing, the, storm, away, from, land, with, giant, fans, and, seeding, selected, storms, with, dry, ice, or, silver, iodide, these, techniques, however, fail, to, appreciate, the, duration, intensity, power, or, size, of, tropical, cyclones, a, variety, of, methods, or, techniques, including, surface, satellite, and, aerial, are, used, to, assess, the, intensity, of, a, tropical, cyclone, reconnaissance, aircraft, fly, around, and, through, tropical, cyclones, outfitted, with, specialized, instruments, to, collect, information, that, can, be, used, to, ascertain, the, winds, and, pressure, of, a, system, tropical, cyclones, possess, winds, of, different, speeds, at, different, heights, winds, recorded, at, flight, level, can, be, converted, to, find, the, wind, speeds, at, the, surface, surface, observations, such, as, ship, reports, land, stations, mesonets, coastal, stations, and, buoys, can, provide, information, on, a, tropical, cyclone, s, intensity, or, the, direction, it, is, traveling, wind, pressure, relationships, wprs, are, used, as, a, way, to, determine, the, pressure, of, a, storm, based, on, its, wind, speed, several, different, methods, and, equations, have, been, proposed, to, calculate, wprs, tropical, cyclones, agencies, each, use, their, own, fixed, wpr, which, can, result, in, inaccuracies, between, agencies, that, are, issuing, estimates, on, the, same, system, the, ascat, is, a, scatterometer, used, by, the, metop, satellites, to, map, the, wind, field, vectors, of, tropical, cyclones, the, smap, uses, an, l, band, radiometer, channel, to, determine, the, wind, speeds, of, tropical, cyclones, at, the, ocean, surface, and, has, been, shown, to, be, reliable, at, higher, intensities, and, under, heavy, rainfall, conditions, unlike, scatterometer, based, and, other, radiometer, based, instruments, the, dvorak, technique, plays, a, large, role, in, both, the, classification, of, a, tropical, cyclone, and, the, determination, of, its, intensity, used, in, warning, centers, the, method, was, developed, by, vernon, dvorak, in, the, 1970s, and, uses, both, visible, and, infrared, satellite, imagery, in, the, assessment, of, tropical, cyclone, intensity, the, dvorak, technique, uses, a, scale, of, t, numbers, scaling, in, increments, of, 0, 5, from, t1, 0, to, t8, 0, each, t, number, has, an, intensity, assigned, to, it, with, larger, t, numbers, indicating, a, stronger, system, tropical, cyclones, are, assessed, by, forecasters, according, to, an, array, of, patterns, including, curved, banding, features, shear, central, dense, overcast, and, eye, in, order, to, determine, the, t, number, and, thus, assess, the, intensity, of, the, storm, the, cooperative, institute, for, meteorological, satellite, studies, works, to, develop, and, improve, automated, satellite, methods, such, as, the, advanced, dvorak, technique, adt, and, satcon, the, adt, used, by, a, large, number, of, forecasting, centers, uses, infrared, geostationary, satellite, imagery, and, an, algorithm, based, upon, the, dvorak, technique, to, assess, the, intensity, of, tropical, cyclones, the, adt, has, a, number, of, differences, from, the, conventional, dvorak, technique, including, changes, to, intensity, constraint, rules, and, the, usage, of, microwave, imagery, to, base, a, system, s, intensity, upon, its, internal, structure, which, prevents, the, intensity, from, leveling, off, before, an, eye, emerges, in, infrared, imagery, the, satcon, weights, estimates, from, various, satellite, based, systems, and, microwave, sounders, accounting, for, the, strengths, and, flaws, in, each, individual, estimate, to, produce, a, consensus, estimate, of, a, tropical, cyclone, s, intensity, which, can, be, more, reliable, than, the, dvorak, technique, at, times, multiple, intensity, metrics, are, used, including, accumulated, cyclone, energy, ace, the, hurricane, surge, index, the, hurricane, severity, index, the, power, dissipation, index, pdi, and, integrated, kinetic, energy, ike, ace, is, a, metric, of, the, total, energy, a, system, has, exerted, over, its, lifespan, ace, is, calculated, by, summing, the, squares, of, a, cyclone, s, sustained, wind, speed, every, six, hours, as, long, as, the, system, is, at, or, above, tropical, storm, intensity, and, either, tropical, or, subtropical, the, calculation, of, the, pdi, is, similar, in, nature, to, ace, with, the, major, difference, being, that, wind, speeds, are, cubed, rather, than, squared, the, hurricane, surge, index, is, a, metric, of, the, potential, damage, a, storm, may, inflict, via, storm, surge, it, is, calculated, by, squaring, the, dividend, of, the, storm, s, wind, speed, and, a, climatological, value, 33, m, s, or, 74, mph, and, then, multiplying, that, quantity, by, the, dividend, of, the, radius, of, hurricane, force, winds, and, its, climatological, value, 96, 6, km, or, 60, 0, mi, this, can, be, represented, in, equation, form, as, where, v, textstyle, v, is, the, storm, s, wind, speed, and, r, textstyle, r, is, the, radius, of, hurricane, force, winds, the, hurricane, severity, index, is, a, scale, that, can, assign, up, to, 50, points, to, a, system, up, to, 25, points, come, from, intensity, while, the, other, 25, come, from, the, size, of, the, storm, s, wind, field, the, ike, model, measures, the, destructive, capability, of, a, tropical, cyclone, via, winds, waves, and, surge, it, is, calculated, as, where, p, textstyle, p, is, the, density, of, air, u, textstyle, u, is, a, sustained, surface, wind, speed, value, and, d, v, textstyle, d, v, is, the, volume, element, around, the, world, tropical, cyclones, are, classified, in, different, ways, based, on, the, location, tropical, cyclone, basins, the, structure, of, the, system, and, its, intensity, for, example, within, the, northern, atlantic, and, eastern, pacific, basins, a, tropical, cyclone, with, wind, speeds, of, over, 65, kn, 120, km, h, 75, mph, is, called, a, hurricane, while, it, is, called, a, typhoon, or, a, severe, cyclonic, storm, within, the, western, pacific, or, north, indian, oceans, when, a, hurricane, passes, west, across, the, international, dateline, in, the, northern, hemisphere, it, becomes, known, as, a, typhoon, this, happened, in, 2014, for, hurricane, genevieve, which, became, typhoon, genevieve, within, the, southern, hemisphere, it, is, either, called, a, hurricane, tropical, cyclone, or, a, severe, tropical, cyclone, depending, on, if, it, is, located, within, the, south, atlantic, south, west, indian, ocean, australian, region, or, the, south, pacific, ocean, the, descriptors, for, tropical, cyclones, with, wind, speeds, below, 65, kn, 120, km, h, 75, mph, also, vary, by, tropical, cyclone, basin, and, may, be, further, subdivided, into, categories, such, as, tropical, storm, cyclonic, storm, tropical, depression, or, deep, depression, the, practice, of, using, given, names, to, identify, tropical, cyclones, dates, back, to, the, late, 1800s, and, early, 1900s, and, gradually, superseded, the, existing, system, simply, naming, cyclones, based, on, what, they, hit, the, system, currently, used, provides, positive, identification, of, severe, weather, systems, in, a, brief, form, that, is, readily, understood, and, recognized, by, the, public, the, credit, for, the, first, usage, of, personal, names, for, weather, systems, is, generally, given, to, the, queensland, government, meteorologist, clement, wragge, who, named, systems, between, 1887, and, 1907, this, system, of, naming, weather, systems, subsequently, fell, into, disuse, for, several, years, after, wragge, retired, until, it, was, revived, in, the, latter, part, of, world, war, ii, for, the, western, pacific, formal, naming, schemes, have, subsequently, been, introduced, for, the, north, and, south, atlantic, eastern, central, western, and, southern, pacific, basins, as, well, as, the, australian, region, and, indian, ocean, at, present, tropical, cyclones, are, officially, named, by, one, of, twelve, meteorological, services, and, retain, their, names, throughout, their, lifetimes, to, provide, ease, of, communication, between, forecasters, and, the, general, public, regarding, forecasts, watches, and, warnings, since, the, systems, can, last, a, week, or, longer, and, more, than, one, can, be, occurring, in, the, same, basin, at, the, same, time, the, names, are, thought, to, reduce, the, confusion, about, what, storm, is, being, described, names, are, assigned, in, order, from, predetermined, lists, with, one, three, or, ten, minute, sustained, wind, speeds, of, more, than, 65, km, h, 40, mph, depending, on, which, basin, it, originates, however, standards, vary, from, basin, to, basin, with, some, tropical, depressions, named, in, the, western, pacific, while, tropical, cyclones, have, to, have, a, significant, amount, of, gale, force, winds, occurring, around, the, center, before, they, are, named, within, the, southern, hemisphere, the, names, of, significant, tropical, cyclones, in, the, north, atlantic, ocean, pacific, ocean, and, australian, region, are, retired, from, the, naming, lists, and, replaced, with, another, name, tropical, cyclones, that, develop, around, the, world, are, assigned, an, identification, code, consisting, of, a, two, digit, number, and, suffix, letter, by, the, warning, centers, that, monitor, them, in, addition, to, tropical, cyclones, there, are, two, other, classes, of, cyclones, within, the, spectrum, of, cyclone, types, these, kinds, of, cyclones, known, as, extratropical, cyclones, and, subtropical, cyclones, can, be, stages, a, tropical, cyclone, passes, through, during, its, formation, or, dissipation, an, extratropical, cyclone, is, a, storm, that, derives, energy, from, horizontal, temperature, differences, which, are, typical, in, higher, latitudes, a, tropical, cyclone, can, become, extratropical, as, it, moves, toward, higher, latitudes, if, its, energy, source, changes, from, heat, released, by, condensation, to, differences, in, temperature, between, air, masses, although, not, as, frequently, an, extratropical, cyclone, can, transform, into, a, subtropical, storm, and, from, there, into, a, tropical, cyclone, from, space, extratropical, storms, have, a, characteristic, comma, shaped, cloud, pattern, extratropical, cyclones, can, also, be, dangerous, when, their, low, pressure, centers, cause, powerful, winds, and, high, seas, a, subtropical, cyclone, is, a, weather, system, that, has, some, characteristics, of, a, tropical, cyclone, and, some, characteristics, of, an, extratropical, cyclone, they, can, form, in, a, wide, band, of, latitudes, from, the, equator, to, 50, although, subtropical, storms, rarely, have, hurricane, force, winds, they, may, become, tropical, in, nature, as, their, cores, warm, at, the, center, of, a, mature, tropical, cyclone, air, sinks, rather, than, rises, for, a, sufficiently, strong, storm, air, may, sink, over, a, layer, deep, enough, to, suppress, cloud, formation, thereby, creating, a, clear, eye, weather, in, the, eye, is, normally, calm, and, free, of, convective, clouds, although, the, sea, may, be, extremely, violent, the, eye, is, normally, circular, and, is, typically, 30, 65, km, 19, 40, mi, in, diameter, though, eyes, as, small, as, 3, km, 1, 9, mi, and, as, large, as, 370, km, 230, mi, have, been, observed, the, cloudy, outer, edge, of, the, eye, is, called, the, eyewall, the, eyewall, typically, expands, outward, with, height, resembling, an, arena, football, stadium, this, phenomenon, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, stadium, effect, the, eyewall, is, where, the, greatest, wind, speeds, are, found, air, rises, most, rapidly, clouds, reach, their, highest, altitude, and, precipitation, is, the, heaviest, the, heaviest, wind, damage, occurs, where, a, tropical, cyclone, s, eyewall, passes, over, land, in, a, weaker, storm, the, eye, may, be, obscured, by, the, central, dense, overcast, which, is, the, upper, level, cirrus, shield, that, is, associated, with, a, concentrated, area, of, strong, thunderstorm, activity, near, the, center, of, a, tropical, cyclone, the, eyewall, may, vary, over, time, in, the, form, of, eyewall, replacement, cycles, particularly, in, intense, tropical, cyclones, outer, rainbands, can, organize, into, an, outer, ring, of, thunderstorms, that, slowly, moves, inward, which, is, believed, to, rob, the, primary, eyewall, of, moisture, and, angular, momentum, when, the, primary, eyewall, weakens, the, tropical, cyclone, weakens, temporarily, the, outer, eyewall, eventually, replaces, the, primary, one, at, the, end, of, the, cycle, at, which, time, the, storm, may, return, to, its, original, intensity, there, are, a, variety, of, metrics, commonly, used, to, measure, storm, size, the, most, common, metrics, include, the, radius, of, maximum, wind, the, radius, of, 34, knot, 17, m, s, 63, km, h, 39, mph, wind, i, e, gale, force, the, radius, of, outermost, closed, isobar, roci, and, the, radius, of, vanishing, wind, an, additional, metric, is, the, radius, at, which, the, cyclone, s, relative, vorticity, field, decreases, to, 1, 10, 5, s, 1, on, earth, tropical, cyclones, span, a, large, range, of, sizes, from, 100, 2, 000, km, 62, 1, 243, mi, as, measured, by, the, radius, of, vanishing, wind, they, are, largest, on, average, in, the, northwest, pacific, ocean, basin, and, smallest, in, the, northeastern, pacific, ocean, basin, if, the, radius, of, outermost, closed, isobar, is, less, than, two, degrees, of, latitude, 222, km, 138, mi, then, the, cyclone, is, very, small, or, a, midget, a, radius, of, 3, 6, latitude, degrees, 333, 670, km, 207, 416, mi, is, considered, average, sized, very, large, tropical, cyclones, have, a, radius, of, greater, than, 8, degrees, 888, km, 552, mi, observations, indicate, that, size, is, only, weakly, correlated, to, variables, such, as, storm, intensity, i, e, maximum, wind, speed, radius, of, maximum, wind, latitude, and, maximum, potential, intensity, typhoon, tip, is, the, largest, cyclone, on, record, with, tropical, storm, force, winds, 2, 170, km, 1, 350, mi, in, diameter, the, smallest, storm, on, record, is, tropical, storm, marco, of, 2008, which, generated, tropical, storm, force, winds, only, 37, km, 23, mi, in, diameter, the, movement, of, a, tropical, cyclone, i, e, its, track, is, typically, approximated, as, the, sum, of, two, terms, steering, by, the, background, environmental, wind, and, beta, drift, some, tropical, cyclones, can, move, across, large, distances, such, as, hurricane, john, the, second, longest, lasting, tropical, cyclone, on, record, which, traveled, 13, 280, km, 8, 250, mi, the, longest, track, of, any, northern, hemisphere, tropical, cyclone, over, its, 31, day, lifespan, in, 1994, environmental, steering, is, the, primary, influence, on, the, motion, of, tropical, cyclones, it, represents, the, movement, of, the, storm, due, to, prevailing, winds, and, other, wider, environmental, conditions, similar, to, leaves, carried, along, by, a, stream, physically, the, winds, or, flow, field, in, the, vicinity, of, a, tropical, cyclone, may, be, treated, as, having, two, parts, the, flow, associated, with, the, storm, itself, and, the, large, scale, background, flow, of, the, environment, tropical, cyclones, can, be, treated, as, local, maxima, of, vorticity, suspended, within, the, large, scale, background, flow, of, the, environment, in, this, way, tropical, cyclone, motion, may, be, represented, to, first, order, as, advection, of, the, storm, by, the, local, environmental, flow, this, environmental, flow, is, termed, the, steering, flow, and, is, the, dominant, influence, on, tropical, cyclone, motion, the, strength, and, direction, of, the, steering, flow, can, be, approximated, as, a, vertical, integration, of, the, winds, blowing, horizontally, in, the, cyclone, s, vicinity, weighted, by, the, altitude, at, which, those, winds, are, occurring, because, winds, can, vary, with, height, determining, the, steering, flow, precisely, can, be, difficult, the, pressure, altitude, at, which, the, background, winds, are, most, correlated, with, a, tropical, cyclone, s, motion, is, known, as, the, steering, level, the, motion, of, stronger, tropical, cyclones, is, more, correlated, with, the, background, flow, averaged, across, a, thicker, portion, of, troposphere, compared, to, weaker, tropical, cyclones, whose, motion, is, more, correlated, with, the, background, flow, averaged, across, a, narrower, extent, of, the, lower, troposphere, when, wind, shear, and, latent, heat, release, is, present, tropical, cyclones, tend, to, move, towards, regions, where, potential, vorticity, is, increasing, most, quickly, climatologically, tropical, cyclones, are, steered, primarily, westward, by, the, east, to, west, trade, winds, on, the, equatorial, side, of, the, subtropical, ridge, a, persistent, high, pressure, area, over, the, world, s, subtropical, oceans, in, the, tropical, north, atlantic, and, northeast, pacific, oceans, the, trade, winds, steer, tropical, easterly, waves, westward, from, the, african, coast, toward, the, caribbean, sea, north, america, and, ultimately, into, the, central, pacific, ocean, before, the, waves, dampen, out, these, waves, are, the, precursors, to, many, tropical, cyclones, within, this, region, in, contrast, in, the, indian, ocean, and, western, pacific, in, both, hemispheres, tropical, cyclogenesis, is, influenced, less, by, tropical, easterly, waves, and, more, by, the, seasonal, movement, of, the, intertropical, convergence, zone, and, the, monsoon, trough, other, weather, systems, such, as, mid, latitude, troughs, and, broad, monsoon, gyres, can, also, influence, tropical, cyclone, motion, by, modifying, the, steering, flow, in, addition, to, environmental, steering, a, tropical, cyclone, will, tend, to, drift, poleward, and, westward, a, motion, known, as, beta, drift, this, motion, is, due, to, the, superposition, of, a, vortex, such, as, a, tropical, cyclone, onto, an, environment, in, which, the, coriolis, force, varies, with, latitude, such, as, on, a, sphere, or, beta, plane, the, magnitude, of, the, component, of, tropical, cyclone, motion, associated, with, the, beta, drift, ranges, between, 1, 3, m, s, 3, 6, 10, 8, km, h, 2, 2, 6, 7, mph, and, tends, to, be, larger, for, more, intense, tropical, cyclones, and, at, higher, latitudes, it, is, induced, indirectly, by, the, storm, itself, as, a, result, of, feedback, between, the, cyclonic, flow, of, the, storm, and, its, environment, physically, the, cyclonic, circulation, of, the, storm, advects, environmental, air, poleward, east, of, center, and, equatorial, west, of, center, because, air, must, conserve, its, angular, momentum, this, flow, configuration, induces, a, cyclonic, gyre, equatorward, and, westward, of, the, storm, center, and, an, anticyclonic, gyre, poleward, and, eastward, of, the, storm, center, the, combined, flow, of, these, gyres, acts, to, advect, the, storm, slowly, poleward, and, westward, this, effect, occurs, even, if, there, is, zero, environmental, flow, due, to, a, direct, dependence, of, the, beta, drift, on, angular, momentum, the, size, of, a, tropical, cyclone, can, affect, the, influence, of, beta, drift, on, its, motion, beta, drift, imparts, a, greater, influence, on, the, movement, of, larger, tropical, cyclones, than, that, of, smaller, ones, a, third, component, of, motion, that, occurs, relatively, infrequently, involves, the, interaction, of, multiple, tropical, cyclones, when, two, cyclones, approach, one, another, their, centers, will, begin, orbiting, cyclonically, about, a, point, between, the, two, systems, depending, on, their, separation, distance, and, strength, the, two, vortices, may, simply, orbit, around, one, another, or, else, may, spiral, into, the, center, point, and, merge, when, the, two, vortices, are, of, unequal, size, the, larger, vortex, will, tend, to, dominate, the, interaction, and, the, smaller, vortex, will, orbit, around, it, this, phenomenon, is, called, the, fujiwhara, effect, after, sakuhei, fujiwhara, though, a, tropical, cyclone, typically, moves, from, east, to, west, in, the, tropics, its, track, may, shift, poleward, and, eastward, either, as, it, moves, west, of, the, subtropical, ridge, axis, or, else, if, it, interacts, with, the, mid, latitude, flow, such, as, the, jet, stream, or, an, extratropical, cyclone, this, motion, termed, recurvature, commonly, occurs, near, the, western, edge, of, the, major, ocean, basins, where, the, jet, stream, typically, has, a, poleward, component, and, extratropical, cyclones, are, common, an, example, of, tropical, cyclone, recurvature, was, typhoon, ioke, in, 2006, tropical, cyclones, out, at, sea, cause, large, waves, heavy, rain, floods, and, high, winds, disrupting, international, shipping, and, at, times, causing, shipwrecks, tropical, cyclones, stir, up, water, leaving, a, cool, wake, behind, them, which, causes, the, region, to, be, less, favorable, for, subsequent, tropical, cyclones, on, land, strong, winds, can, damage, or, destroy, vehicles, buildings, bridges, and, other, outside, objects, turning, loose, debris, into, deadly, flying, projectiles, the, storm, surge, or, the, increase, in, sea, level, due, to, the, cyclone, is, typically, the, worst, effect, from, landfalling, tropical, cyclones, historically, resulting, in, 90, of, tropical, cyclone, deaths, cyclone, mahina,

latitudes, and, polar, regions, and, by, regulating, the, thermohaline, circulation, through, upweling, research, on, pacific, cyclones, has, demonstrated, that, deeper, layers, of, the, ocean, receive, a, heat, transfer, from, these, powerful, storms, the, storm, surge, and, winds, of, hurricanes, may, be, destructive, to, human, made, structures, but, they, also, stir, up, the, waters, of, coastal, estuaries, which, are, typically, important, fish, breeding, locales, ecosystems, such, as, saltmarshes, and, mangrove, forests, can, be, severely, damaged, or, destroyed, by, tropical, cyclones, which, erode, land, and, destroy, vegetation, tropical, cyclones, can, cause, harmful, algae, blooms, to, form, in, bodies, of, water, by, increasing, the, amount, of, nutrients, available, insect, populations, can, decrease, in, both, quantity, and, diversity, after, the, passage, of, storms, strong, winds, associated, with, tropical, cyclones, and, their, remnants, are, capable, of, felling, thousands, of, trees, causing, damage, to, forests, when, hurricanes, surge, upon, shore, from, the, ocean, salt, is, introduced, to, many, freshwater, areas, and, raises, the, salinity, levels, too, high, for, some, habitats, to, withstand, some, are, able, to, cope, with, the, salt, and, recycle, it, back, into, the, ocean, but, others, can, not, release, the, extra, surface, water, quickly, enough, or, do, not, have, a, large, enough, freshwater, source, to, replace, it, because, of, this, some, species, of, plants, and, vegetation, die, due, to, the, excess, salt, in, addition, hurricanes, can, carry, toxins, and, acids, onshore, when, they, make, landfall, the, floodwater, can, pick, up, the, toxins, from, different, spills, and, contaminate, the, land, that, it, passes, over, these, toxins, are, harmful, to, the, people, and, animals, in, the, area, as, well, as, the, environment, around, them, tropical, cyclones, can, cause, oil, spills, by, damaging, or, destroying, pipelines, and, storage, facilities, similarly, chemical, spills, have, been, reported, when, chemical, and, processing, facilities, were, damaged, waterways, have, become, contaminated, with, toxic, levels, of, metals, such, as, nickel, chromium, and, mercury, during, tropical, cyclones, tropical, cyclones, can, have, an, extensive, effect, on, geography, such, as, creating, or, destroying, land, cyclone, bebe, increased, the, size, of, tuvalu, island, funafuti, atoll, by, nearly, 20, hurricane, walaka, destroyed, the, small, east, island, in, 2018, which, destroyed, the, habitat, for, the, endangered, hawaiian, monk, seal, as, well, as, threatened, sea, turtles, and, seabirds, landslides, frequently, occur, during, tropical, cyclones, and, can, vastly, alter, landscapes, some, storms, are, capable, of, causing, hundreds, to, tens, of, thousands, of, landslides, storms, can, erode, coastlines, over, an, extensive, area, and, transport, the, sediment, to, other, locations, tropical, cyclones, have, occurred, around, the, world, for, millennia, reanalyses, and, research, are, being, undertaken, to, extend, the, historical, record, through, the, usage, of, proxy, data, such, as, overwash, deposits, beach, ridges, and, historical, documents, such, as, diaries, major, tropical, cyclones, leave, traces, in, overwash, records, and, shell, layers, in, some, coastal, areas, which, have, been, used, to, gain, insight, into, hurricane, activity, over, the, past, thousands, of, years, sediment, records, in, western, australia, suggest, an, intense, tropical, cyclone, in, the, 4th, millennium, bc, proxy, records, based, on, paleotempestological, research, have, revealed, that, major, hurricane, activity, along, the, gulf, of, mexico, coast, varies, on, timescales, of, centuries, to, millennia, in, the, year, 957, a, powerful, typhoon, struck, southern, china, killing, around, 10, 000, people, due, to, flooding, the, spanish, colonization, of, mexico, described, tempestades, in, 1730, although, the, official, record, for, pacific, hurricanes, only, dates, to, 1949, in, the, south, west, indian, ocean, the, tropical, cyclone, record, goes, back, to, 1848, in, 2003, the, atlantic, hurricane, reanalysis, project, examined, and, analyzed, the, historical, record, of, tropical, cyclones, in, the, atlantic, back, to, 1851, extending, the, existing, database, from, 1886, before, satellite, imagery, became, available, during, the, 20th, century, many, of, these, systems, went, undetected, unless, it, impacted, land, or, a, ship, encountered, it, by, chance, often, in, part, because, of, the, threat, of, hurricanes, many, coastal, regions, had, sparse, population, between, major, ports, until, the, advent, of, automobile, tourism, therefore, the, most, severe, portions, of, hurricanes, striking, the, coast, may, have, gone, unmeasured, in, some, instances, the, combined, effects, of, ship, destruction, and, remote, landfall, severely, limit, the, number, of, intense, hurricanes, in, the, official, record, before, the, era, of, hurricane, reconnaissance, aircraft, and, satellite, meteorology, although, the, record, shows, a, distinct, increase, in, the, number, and, strength, of, intense, hurricanes, therefore, experts, regard, the, early, data, as, suspect, the, ability, of, climatologists, to, make, a, long, term, analysis, of, tropical, cyclones, is, limited, by, the, amount, of, reliable, historical, data, during, the, 1940s, routine, aircraft, reconnaissance, started, in, both, the, atlantic, and, western, pacific, basin, during, the, mid, 1940s, which, provided, ground, truth, data, however, early, flights, were, only, made, once, or, twice, a, day, polar, orbiting, weather, satellites, were, first, launched, by, the, united, states, national, aeronautics, and, space, administration, in, 1960, but, were, not, declared, operational, until, 1965, however, it, took, several, years, for, some, of, the, warning, centers, to, take, advantage, of, this, new, viewing, platform, and, develop, the, expertise, to, associate, satellite, signatures, with, storm, position, and, intensity, intense, tropical, cyclones, pose, a, particular, observation, challenge, as, they, are, a, dangerous, oceanic, phenomenon, and, weather, stations, being, relatively, sparse, are, rarely, available, on, the, site, of, the, storm, itself, in, general, surface, observations, are, available, only, if, the, storm, is, passing, over, an, island, or, a, coastal, area, or, if, there, is, a, nearby, ship, real, time, measurements, are, usually, taken, in, the, periphery, of, the, cyclone, where, conditions, are, less, catastrophic, and, its, true, strength, cannot, be, evaluated, for, this, reason, there, are, teams, of, meteorologists, that, move, into, the, path, of, tropical, cyclones, to, help, evaluate, their, strength, at, the, point, of, landfall, tropical, cyclones, are, tracked, by, weather, satellites, capturing, visible, and, infrared, images, from, space, usually, at, half, hour, to, quarter, hour, intervals, as, a, storm, approaches, land, it, can, be, observed, by, land, based, doppler, weather, radar, radar, plays, a, crucial, role, around, landfall, by, showing, a, storm, s, location, and, intensity, every, several, minutes, other, satellites, provide, information, from, the, perturbations, of, gps, signals, providing, thousands, of, snapshots, per, day, and, capturing, atmospheric, temperature, pressure, and, moisture, content, in, situ, measurements, in, real, time, can, be, taken, by, sending, specially, equipped, reconnaissance, flights, into, the, cyclone, in, the, atlantic, basin, these, flights, are, regularly, flown, by, united, states, government, hurricane, hunters, these, aircraft, fly, directly, into, the, cyclone, and, take, direct, and, remote, sensing, measurements, the, aircraft, also, launch, gps, dropsondes, inside, the, cyclone, these, sondes, measure, temperature, humidity, pressure, and, especially, winds, between, flight, level, and, the, ocean, s, surface, a, new, era, in, hurricane, observation, began, when, a, remotely, piloted, aerosonde, a, small, drone, aircraft, was, flown, through, tropical, storm, ophelia, as, it, passed, virginia, s, eastern, shore, during, the, 2005, hurricane, season, a, similar, mission, was, also, completed, successfully, in, the, western, pacific, ocean, high, speed, computers, and, sophisticated, simulation, software, allow, forecasters, to, produce, computer, models, that, predict, tropical, cyclone, tracks, based, on, the, future, position, and, strength, of, high, and, low, pressure, systems, combining, forecast, models, with, increased, understanding, of, the, forces, that, act, on, tropical, cyclones, as, well, as, with, a, wealth, of, data, from, earth, orbiting, satellites, and, other, sensors, scientists, have, increased, the, accuracy, of, track, forecasts, over, recent, decades, however, scientists, are, not, as, skillful, at, predicting, the, intensity, of, tropical, cyclones, the, lack, of, improvement, in, intensity, forecasting, is, attributed, to, the, complexity, of, tropical, systems, and, an, incomplete, understanding, of, factors, that, affect, their, development, new, tropical, cyclone, position, and, forecast, information, is, available, at, least, every, six, hours, from, the, various, warning, centers, in, meteorology, geopotential, heights, are, used, when, creating, forecasts, and, analyzing, pressure, systems, geopotential, heights, represent, the, estimate, of, the, real, height, of, a, pressure, system, above, the, average, sea, level, geopotential, heights, for, weather, are, divided, up, into, several, levels, the, lowest, geopotential, height, level, is, 850, hpa, 25, 10, inhg, which, represents, the, lowest, 1, 500, m, 5, 000, ft, of, the, atmosphere, the, moisture, content, gained, by, using, either, the, relative, humidity, or, the, precipitable, water, value, is, used, in, creating, forecasts, for, precipitation, the, next, level, 700, hpa, 20, 67, inhg, is, at, a, height, of, 2, 300, 3, 200, m, 7, 700, 10, 500, ft, 700, hpa, is, regarded, as, the, highest, point, in, the, lower, atmosphere, at, this, layer, both, vertical, movement, and, moisture, levels, are, used, to, locate, and, create, forecasts, for, precipitation, the, middle, level, of, the, atmosphere, is, at, 500, hpa, 14, 76, inhg, or, a, height, of, 4, 900, 6, 100, m, 16, 000, 20, 000, ft, the, 500, hpa, level, is, used, for, measuring, atmospheric, vorticity, commonly, known, as, the, spin, of, air, the, relative, humidity, is, also, analyzed, at, this, height, in, order, to, establish, where, precipitation, is, likely, to, materialize, the, next, level, occurs, at, 300, hpa, 8, 859, inhg, or, a, height, of, 8, 200, 9, 800, m, 27, 000, 32, 000, ft, the, top, most, level, is, located, at, 200, hpa, 5, 906, inhg, which, corresponds, to, a, height, of, 11, 000, 12, 000, m, 35, 000, 41, 000, ft, both, the, 200, and, 300, hpa, levels, are, mainly, used, to, locate, the, jet, stream, ahead, of, the, formal, season, starting, people, are, urged, to, prepare, for, the, effects, of, a, tropical, cyclone, by, politicians, and, weather, forecasters, among, others, they, prepare, by, determining, their, risk, to, the, different, types, of, weather, tropical, cyclones, cause, checking, their, insurance, coverage, and, emergency, supplies, as, well, as, determining, where, to, evacuate, to, if, needed, when, a, tropical, cyclone, develops, and, is, forecast, to, impact, land, each, member, nation, of, the, world, meteorological, organization, issues, various, watches, and, warnings, to, cover, the, expected, effects, however, there, are, some, exceptions, with, the, united, states, national, hurricane, center, and, fiji, meteorological, service, responsible, for, issuing, or, recommending, warnings, for, other, nations, in, their, area, of, responsibility, 2, 4, an, important, decision, in, individual, preparedness, is, determining, if, and, when, to, evacuate, an, area, that, will, be, affected, by, a, tropical, cyclone, tropical, cyclone, tracking, charts, allow, people, to, track, ongoing, systems, to, form, their, own, opinions, regarding, where, the, storms, are, going, and, whether, or, not, they, need, to, prepare, for, the, system, being, tracked, including, possible, evacuation, this, continues, to, be, encouraged, by, the, national, oceanic, and, atmospheric, administration, and, national, hurricane, center, hurricane, response, is, the, disaster, response, after, a, hurricane, activities, performed, by, hurricane, responders, include, assessment, restoration, and, demolition, of, buildings, removal, of, debris, and, waste, repairs, to, land, based, and, maritime, infrastructure, and, public, health, services, including, search, and, rescue, operations, hurricane, response, requires, coordination, between, federal, tribal, state, local, and, private, entities, according, to, the, national, voluntary, organizations, active, in, disaster, potential, response, volunteers, should, affiliate, with, established, organizations, and, should, not, self, deploy, so, that, proper, training, and, support, can, be, provided, to, mitigate, the, danger, and, stress, of, response, work, hurricane, responders, face, many, hazards, hurricane, responders, may, be, exposed, to, chemical, and, biological, contaminants, including, stored, chemicals, sewage, human, remains, and, mold, growth, encouraged, by, flooding, as, well, as, asbestos, and, lead, that, may, be, present, in, older, buildings, common, injuries, arise, from, falls, from, heights, such, as, from, a, ladder, or, from, level, surfaces, from, electrocution, in, flooded, areas, including, from, backfeed, from, portable, generators, or, from, motor, vehicle, accidents, long, and, irregular, shifts, may, lead, to, sleep, deprivation, and, fatigue, increasing, the, risk, of, injuries, and, workers, may, experience,
