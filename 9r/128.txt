the, large, magellanic, cloud, lmc, is, a, dwarf, galaxy, and, satellite, galaxy, of, the, milky, way, at, a, distance, of, around, 50, kiloparsecs, 163, 000, light, years, the, lmc, is, the, second, or, third, closest, galaxy, to, the, milky, way, after, the, sagittarius, dwarf, spheroidal, c, 16, kiloparsecs, 52, 000, light, years, away, and, the, possible, dwarf, irregular, galaxy, called, the, canis, major, overdensity, based, on, the, d, 25, isophote, at, the, b, band, 445, nm, wavelength, of, light, the, large, magellanic, cloud, is, about, 9, 86, kiloparsecs, 32, 200, light, years, across, it, is, roughly, one, hundredth, the, mass, of, the, milky, way, and, is, the, fourth, largest, galaxy, in, the, local, group, after, the, andromeda, galaxy, m31, the, milky, way, and, the, triangulum, galaxy, m33, the, lmc, is, classified, as, a, magellanic, spiral, it, contains, a, stellar, bar, that, is, geometrically, off, center, suggesting, that, it, was, once, a, barred, dwarf, spiral, galaxy, before, its, spiral, arms, were, disrupted, likely, by, tidal, interactions, from, the, nearby, small, magellanic, cloud, smc, and, the, milky, way, s, gravity, the, lmc, is, predicted, to, merge, with, the, milky, way, in, approximately, 2, 4, billion, years, with, a, declination, of, about, 70, the, lmc, is, visible, as, a, faint, cloud, from, the, southern, hemisphere, of, the, earth, and, from, as, far, north, as, 20, n, it, straddles, the, constellations, dorado, and, mensa, and, has, an, apparent, length, of, about, 10, to, the, naked, eye, 20, times, the, moon, s, diameter, from, dark, sites, away, from, light, pollution, both, the, large, and, small, magellanic, clouds, have, been, easily, visible, for, southern, nighttime, observers, well, back, into, prehistory, it, has, been, claimed, that, the, first, known, written, mention, of, the, large, magellanic, cloud, was, by, the, persian, astronomer, abd, al, rahman, al, sufi, shirazi, later, known, in, europe, as, azophi, which, he, referred, to, as, al, bakr, the, white, ox, in, his, book, of, fixed, stars, around, 964, ad, however, this, seems, to, be, a, misunderstanding, of, a, reference, to, some, stars, south, of, canopus, which, he, admits, he, has, not, seen, the, first, confirmed, recorded, observation, was, in, 1503, 1504, by, amerigo, vespucci, in, a, letter, about, his, third, voyage, he, mentioned, three, canopes, two, bright, and, one, obscure, bright, refers, to, the, two, magellanic, clouds, and, obscure, refers, to, the, coalsack, ferdinand, magellan, sighted, the, lmc, on, his, voyage, in, 1519, and, his, writings, brought, it, into, common, western, knowledge, the, galaxy, now, bears, his, name, the, galaxy, and, southern, end, of, dorado, are, in, the, current, epoch, at, opposition, on, about, 5, december, when, thus, visible, from, sunset, to, sunrise, from, equatorial, points, such, as, ecuador, the, congos, uganda, kenya, and, indonesia, and, for, part, of, the, night, in, nearby, months, above, about, 28, south, such, as, most, of, australia, and, south, africa, the, galaxy, is, always, sufficiently, above, the, horizon, to, be, considered, properly, circumpolar, thus, during, spring, and, autumn, the, cloud, is, also, visible, much, of, the, night, and, the, height, of, winter, in, june, nearly, coincides, with, closest, proximity, to, the, sun, s, apparent, position, measurements, with, the, hubble, space, telescope, announced, in, 2006, suggest, the, large, and, small, magellanic, clouds, may, be, moving, too, quickly, to, be, orbiting, the, milky, way, astronomers, discovered, a, new, black, hole, inside, the, large, magellanic, cloud, in, november, 2021, using, the, european, southern, observatory, s, very, large, telescope, in, chile, astronomers, claim, its, gravity, is, influenced, by, a, nearby, star, which, is, about, five, times, the, mass, of, the, sun, the, large, magellanic, cloud, has, a, prominent, central, bar, and, spiral, arm, the, central, bar, seems, to, be, warped, so, that, the, east, and, west, ends, are, nearer, the, milky, way, than, the, middle, in, 2014, measurements, from, the, hubble, space, telescope, made, it, possible, to, determine, a, rotation, period, of, 250, million, years, the, lmc, was, long, considered, to, be, a, planar, galaxy, that, could, be, assumed, to, lie, at, a, single, distance, from, the, solar, system, however, in, 1986, caldwell, and, coulson, found, that, field, cepheid, variables, in, the, northeast, lie, closer, to, the, milky, way, than, those, in, the, southwest, from, 2001, to, 2002, this, inclined, geometry, was, confirmed, by, the, same, means, by, core, helium, burning, red, clump, stars, and, by, the, tip, of, the, red, giant, branch, all, three, papers, find, an, inclination, of, 35, where, a, face, on, galaxy, has, an, inclination, of, 0, further, work, on, the, structure, of, the, lmc, using, the, kinematics, of, carbon, stars, showed, that, the, lmc, s, disk, is, both, thick, and, flared, likely, due, to, interactions, with, the, smc, regarding, the, distribution, of, star, clusters, in, the, lmc, schommer, et, al, measured, velocities, for, 80, clusters, and, found, that, the, lmc, s, cluster, system, has, kinematics, consistent, with, the, clusters, moving, in, a, disk, like, distribution, these, results, were, confirmed, by, grocholski, et, al, who, calculated, distances, to, a, sample, of, clusters, and, showed, that, the, cluster, system, is, distributed, in, the, same, plane, as, the, field, stars, distance, to, the, lmc, has, been, calculated, using, standard, candles, cepheid, variables, are, one, of, the, most, popular, these, have, been, shown, to, have, a, relationship, between, their, absolute, luminosity, and, the, period, over, which, their, brightness, varies, however, the, variable, of, metallicity, may, also, need, to, be, taken, as, a, component, of, this, as, consensus, is, this, likely, affects, their, period, luminosity, relations, unfortunately, those, in, the, milky, way, typically, used, to, calibrate, the, relation, are, more, metal, rich, than, those, found, in, the, lmc, modern, 8, meter, class, optical, telescopes, have, discovered, eclipsing, binaries, throughout, the, local, group, parameters, of, these, systems, can, be, measured, without, mass, or, compositional, assumptions, the, light, echoes, of, supernova, 1987a, are, also, geometric, measurements, without, any, stellar, models, or, assumptions, in, 2006, the, cepheid, absolute, luminosity, was, re, calibrated, using, cepheid, variables, in, the, galaxy, messier, 106, that, cover, a, range, of, metallicities, using, this, improved, calibration, they, find, an, absolute, distance, modulus, of, m, m, 0, 18, 41, displaystyle, m, m, 0, 18, 41, or, 48, kpc, 160, 000, light, years, this, distance, has, been, confirmed, by, other, authors, by, cross, correlating, different, measurement, methods, one, can, bound, the, distance, the, residual, errors, are, now, less, than, the, estimated, size, parameters, of, the, lmc, the, results, of, a, study, using, late, type, eclipsing, binaries, to, determine, the, distance, more, accurately, was, published, in, the, scientific, journal, nature, in, march, 2013, a, distance, of, 49, 97, kpc, 163, 000, light, years, with, an, accuracy, of, 2, 2, was, obtained, like, many, irregular, galaxies, the, lmc, is, rich, in, gas, and, dust, and, is, currently, undergoing, vigorous, star, formation, activity, it, holds, the, tarantula, nebula, the, most, active, star, forming, region, in, the, local, group, the, lmc, has, a, wide, range, of, galactic, objects, and, phenomena, that, make, it, known, as, an, astronomical, treasure, house, a, great, celestial, laboratory, for, the, study, of, the, growth, and, evolution, of, the, stars, per, robert, burnham, jr, surveys, of, the, galaxy, have, found, roughly, 60, globular, clusters, 400, planetary, nebulae, and, 700, open, clusters, along, with, hundreds, of, thousands, of, giant, and, supergiant, stars, supernova, 1987a, the, nearest, supernova, in, recent, years, was, in, the, large, magellanic, cloud, the, lionel, murphy, snr, n86, nitrogen, abundant, supernova, remnant, was, named, by, astronomers, at, the, australian, national, university, s, mount, stromlo, observatory, acknowledging, australian, high, court, justice, lionel, murphy, s, interest, in, science, and, its, perceived, resemblance, to, his, large, nose, a, bridge, of, gas, connects, the, small, magellanic, cloud, smc, with, the, lmc, which, evinces, tidal, interaction, between, the, galaxies, the, magellanic, clouds, have, a, common, envelope, of, neutral, hydrogen, indicating, that, they, have, been, gravitationally, bound, for, a, long, time, this, bridge, of, gas, is, a, star, forming, site, no, x, rays, above, background, were, detected, from, either, cloud, during, the, september, 20, 1966, nike, tomahawk, rocket, flight, nor, that, of, two, days, later, the, second, took, off, from, johnston, atoll, at, 17, 13, utc, and, reached, an, apogee, of, 160, km, 99, mi, with, spin, stabilization, at, 5, 6, rps, the, lmc, was, not, detected, in, the, x, ray, range, 8, 80, kev, another, was, launched, from, same, atoll, at, 11, 32, utc,
