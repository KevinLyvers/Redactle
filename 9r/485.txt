an, alum, l, m, is, a, type, of, chemical, compound, usually, a, hydrated, double, sulfate, salt, of, aluminium, with, the, general, formula, x, al, so, 4, 2, 12, h, 2, o, such, that, x, is, a, monovalent, cation, such, as, potassium, or, ammonium, by, itself, alum, often, refers, to, potassium, alum, with, the, formula, kal, so, 4, 2, 12, h, 2, o, other, alums, are, named, after, the, monovalent, ion, such, as, sodium, alum, and, ammonium, alum, the, name, alum, is, also, used, more, generally, for, salts, with, the, same, formula, and, structure, except, that, aluminium, is, replaced, by, another, trivalent, metal, ion, like, chromium, iii, and, or, sulfur, is, replaced, by, another, chalcogen, like, selenium, the, most, common, of, these, analogs, is, chrome, alum, kcr, so, 4, 2, 12, h, 2, o, in, most, industries, the, name, alum, or, papermaker, s, alum, is, used, to, refer, to, aluminium, sulfate, al, 2, so, 4, 3, n, h, 2, o, which, is, used, for, most, industrial, flocculation, 766, the, variable, n, is, an, integer, whose, size, depends, on, the, amount, of, water, absorbed, into, the, alum, for, medicine, the, word, alum, may, also, refer, to, aluminium, hydroxide, gel, used, as, a, vaccine, adjuvant, the, western, desert, of, egypt, was, a, major, source, of, alum, substitutes, in, antiquity, these, evaporites, were, mainly, feal, 2, so, 4, 4, 22, h, 2, o, mgal, 2, so, 4, 4, 22, h, 2, o, naal, so, 4, 2, 6, h, 2, o, mgso, 4, 7h, 2, o, and, al, 2, so, 4, 3, 17, h, 2, o, the, ancient, greek, herodotus, mentions, egyptian, alum, as, a, valuable, commodity, in, the, histories, the, production, of, potassium, alum, from, alunite, is, archaeologically, attested, on, the, island, lesbos, the, site, was, abandoned, during, the, 7th, century, ce, but, dates, back, at, least, to, the, 2nd, century, ce, native, alumen, from, the, island, of, melos, appears, to, have, been, a, mixture, mainly, of, alunogen, al, 2, so, 4, 3, 17, h, 2, o, with, potassium, alum, and, other, minor, sulfates, a, detailed, description, of, a, substance, termed, alumen, occurs, in, the, roman, pliny, the, elder, s, natural, history, by, comparing, pliny, s, description, with, the, account, of, stypteria, given, by, dioscorides, it, is, obvious, the, two, are, identical, pliny, informs, us, that, a, form, of, alumen, was, found, naturally, in, the, earth, and, terms, it, salsugoterrae, pliny, wrote, that, different, substances, were, distinguished, by, the, name, of, alumen, but, they, were, all, characterised, by, a, certain, degree, of, astringency, and, were, all, employed, for, dyeing, and, medicine, pliny, wrote, that, there, is, another, kind, of, alum, that, the, ancient, greeks, term, schiston, and, which, splits, into, filaments, of, a, whitish, colour, from, the, name, schiston, and, the, mode, of, formation, it, seems, that, this, kind, was, the, salt, that, forms, spontaneously, on, certain, salty, minerals, as, alum, slate, and, bituminous, shale, and, consists, mainly, of, sulfates, of, iron, and, aluminium, one, kind, of, alumen, was, a, liquid, which, was, apt, to, be, adulterated, but, when, pure, it, had, the, property, of, blackening, when, added, to, pomegranate, juice, this, property, seems, to, characterize, a, solution, of, iron, ii, sulfate, in, water, a, solution, of, ordinary, potassium, alum, would, possess, no, such, property, contamination, with, iron, sulfate, was, greatly, disliked, as, this, darkened, and, dulled, dye, colours, in, some, places, the, iron, sulfate, may, have, been, lacking, so, the, salt, would, be, white, and, would, be, suitable, according, to, pliny, for, dyeing, bright, colors, pliny, describes, several, other, types, of, alumen, but, it, is, not, clear, as, to, what, these, minerals, are, the, alumen, of, the, ancients, then, was, not, always, potassium, alum, not, even, an, alkali, aluminum, sulfate, 766, 767, alum, and, green, vitriol, iron, sulfate, both, have, sweetish, and, astringent, taste, and, they, had, overlapping, uses, therefore, through, the, middle, ages, alchemists, and, other, writers, do, not, seem, to, have, distinguished, the, two, salts, accurately, in, the, writings, of, the, alchemists, we, find, the, words, misy, sory, and, chalcanthum, applied, to, either, compound, and, the, name, atramentum, sutorium, which, one, might, expect, to, belong, exclusively, to, green, vitriol, applied, indiscriminately, to, both, alum, was, the, most, common, mordant, substance, used, to, set, dyes, on, fabrics, used, by, the, dye, industry, especially, in, islamic, countries, during, the, middle, ages, it, was, the, main, export, of, the, chad, region, from, where, it, was, transported, to, the, markets, of, egypt, and, morocco, and, then, to, europe, less, significant, sources, were, found, in, egypt, and, yemen, during, the, early, 1700s, g, e, stahl, claimed, that, reacting, sulfuric, acid, with, limestone, produced, a, sort, of, alum, the, error, was, soon, corrected, by, johann, heinrich, pott, and, andreas, sigismund, marggraf, who, showed, that, the, precipitate, obtained, when, an, alkali, is, poured, into, a, solution, of, alum, namely, alumina, is, quite, different, from, lime, and, chalk, and, is, one, of, the, ingredients, in, common, clay, 41, 66, marggraf, also, showed, that, perfect, crystals, with, properties, of, alum, can, be, obtained, by, dissolving, alumina, in, sulfuric, acid, and, adding, potash, or, ammonia, to, the, concentrated, solution, 766, 31, 40, in, 1767, torbern, bergman, observed, the, need, for, potassium, or, ammonium, sulfates, to, convert, aluminium, sulfate, into, alum, while, sodium, or, calcium, would, not, work, 766, the, composition, of, common, alum, was, determined, finally, by, louis, vauquelin, in, 1797, as, soon, as, martin, klaproth, discovered, the, presence, of, potassium, in, leucite, and, lepidolite, vauquelin, demonstrated, that, common, alum, is, a, double, salt, composed, of, sulfuric, acid, alumina, and, potash, in, the, same, journal, volume, chaptal, published, the, analysis, of, four, different, kinds, of, alum, namely, roman, alum, levant, alum, british, alum, and, an, alum, manufactured, by, himself, confirming, vauquelin, s, result, some, alums, occur, as, minerals, the, most, important, being, alunite, the, most, important, alums, potassium, sodium, and, ammonium, are, produced, industrially, typical, recipes, involve, combining, aluminium, sulfate, and, the, sulfate, monovalent, cation, the, aluminium, sulfate, is, usually, obtained, by, treating, minerals, like, alum, schist, bauxite, and, cryolite, with, sulfuric, acid, 767, aluminium, based, alums, are, named, by, the, monovalent, cation, unlike, the, other, alkali, metals, lithium, does, not, form, alums, a, fact, attributed, to, the, small, size, of, its, ion, the, most, important, alums, are, aluminium, based, alums, have, a, number, of, common, chemical, properties, they, are, soluble, in, water, have, a, sweetish, taste, react, as, acid, by, turning, blue, litmus, to, red, and, crystallize, in, regular, octahedra, in, alums, each, metal, ion, is, surrounded, by, six, water, molecules, when, heated, they, liquefy, and, if, the, heating, is, continued, the, water, of, crystallization, is, driven, off, the, salt, froths, and, swells, and, at, last, an, amorphous, powder, remains, 766, they, are, astringent, and, acidic, alums, crystallize, in, one, of, three, different, crystal, structures, these, classes, are, called, and, alums, the, first, x, ray, crystal, structures, of, alums, were, reported, in, 1927, by, james, m, cork, and, lawrence, bragg, and, were, used, to, develop, the, phase, retrieval, technique, isomorphous, replacement, the, solubility, of, the, various, alums, in, water, varies, greatly, sodium, alum, being, soluble, readily, in, water, while, caesium, and, rubidium, alums, are, only, slightly, soluble, the, various, solubilities, are, shown, in, the, following, table, 767, at, temperature, t, 100, parts, water, dissolve, aluminium, based, alums, have, been, used, since, antiquity, and, are, still, important, for, many, industrial, processes, the, most, widely, used, alum, is, potassium, alum, it, has, been, used, since, antiquity, as, a, flocculant, to, clarify, turbid, liquids, as, a, mordant, in, dyeing, and, in, tanning, it, is, still, widely, used, in, water, treatment, for, medicine, for, cosmetics, in, deodorant, for, food, preparation, in, baking, powder, and, pickling, and, to, fire, proof, paper, and, cloth, alum, is, also, used, as, a, styptic, in, styptic, pencils, available, from, pharmacists, or, as, an, alum, block, available, from, barber, shops, and, gentlemen, s, outfitters, to, stem, bleeding, from, shaving, nicks, and, as, an, astringent, an, alum, block, can, be, used, directly, as, a, perfume, free, deodorant, antiperspirant, and, unprocessed, mineral, alum, is, sold, in, indian, bazaars, for, just, that, purpose, throughout, island, southeast, asia, potassium, alum, is, most, widely, known, as, tawas, and, has, numerous, uses, it, is, used, as, a, traditional, antiperspirant, and, deodorant, and, in, traditional, medicine, for, open, wounds, and, sores, the, crystals, are, usually, ground, into, a, fine, powder, before, use, during, the, 19th, century, alum, was, used, along, with, other, substances, like, plaster, of, paris, to, adulterate, certain, food, products, particularly, bread, it, was, used, to, make, lower, grade, flour, appear, whiter, allowing, the, producers, to, spend, less, on, whiter, flour, because, it, retains, water, it, would, make, the, bread, heavier, meaning, that, merchants, could, charge, more, for, it, in, their, shops, the, amount, of, alum, present, in, each, loaf, of, bread, could, reach, concentrations, that, would, be, toxic, to, humans, and, cause, chronic, diarrhea, which, could, result, in, the, death, of, young, children, alum, is, used, as, a, mordant, in, traditional, textiles, and, in, indonesia, and, the, philippines, solutions, of, tawas, salt, borax, and, organic, pigments, were, used, to, change, the, color, of, gold, ornaments, in, the, philippines, alum, crystals, were, also, burned, and, allowed, to, drip, into, a, basin, of, water, by, babaylan, for, divination, it, is, also, used, in, other, rituals, in, the, animistic, anito, religions, of, the, islands, for, traditional, japanese, art, alum, and, animal, glue, were, dissolved, in, water, forming, a, liquid, known, as, dousa, japanese, and, used, as, an, undercoat, for, paper, sizing, alum, in, the, form, of, potassium, aluminium, sulphate, or, ammonium, aluminium, sulfate, in, a, concentrated, bath, of, hot, water, is, regularly, used, by, jewelers, and, machinists, to, dissolve, hardened, steel, drill, bits, that, have, broken, off, in, items, made, of, aluminum, copper, brass, gold, any, karat, silver, both, sterling, and, fine, and, stainless, steel, this, is, because, alum, does, not, react, chemically, to, any, significant, degree, with, any, of, these, metals, but, will, corrode, carbon, steel, when, heat, is, applied, to, an, alum, mixture, holding, a, piece, of, work, that, has, a, drill, bit, stuck, in, it, if, the, lost, bit, is, small, enough, it, can, sometimes, be, dissolved, removed, within, hours, many, trivalent, metals, are, capable, of, forming, alums, the, general, form, of, an, alum, is, xy, so, 4, 2, n, h, 2, o, where, x, is, an, alkali, metal, or, ammonium, y, is, a, trivalent, metal, and, n, often, is, 12, the, most, important, example, is, chrome, alum, kcr, so, 4, 2, 12, h, 2, o, a, dark, violet, crystalline, double, sulfate, of, chromium, and, potassium, was, used, in, tanning, in, general, alums, are, formed, more, easily, when, the, alkali, metal, atom, is, larger, this, rule, was, first, stated, by, locke, in, 1902, who, found, that, if, a, trivalent, metal, does, not, form, a, caesium, alum, it, neither, will, form, an, alum, with, any, other, alkali, metal, or, with, ammonium, selenium, or, selenate, alums, are, also, known, that, contain, selenium, in, place, of, sulfur, in, the, sulfate, anion, making, selenate, seo, 2, 4, instead, they, are, strong, oxidizing, agents, in, some, cases, solid, solutions, of, alums, with, different, monovalent, and, trivalent, cations, may, occur, in, addition, to, the, alums, which, are, dodecahydrates, double, sulfates, and, selenates, of, univalent, and, trivalent, cations, occur, with, other, degrees, of, hydration, these, materials, may, also, be, referred, to, as, alums, including, the, undecahydrates, such, as, mendozite, and, kalinite, hexahydrates, such, as, guanidinium, and, dimethylammonium, alums, tetrahydrates, such, as, goldichite, monohydrates, such, as, thallium, plutonium, sulfate, and, anhydrous, alums, yavapaiites, these, classes, include, differing, but, overlapping, combinations, of, ions, a, pseudo, alum, is, a, double, sulfate, of, the, typical, formula, x, so, 4, y, 2, so, 4, 3, 22, h, 2, o, such, that, double, sulfates, with, the, general, formula, x, 2, so, 4, y, 2, so, 4, 3, 24, h, 2, o, are, also, known, where, x, is, a, monovalent, cation, such, as, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, thallium, i, ammonium, or, nh, 4, methylammonium, ch, 3, nh, 3, hydroxylammonium, honh, 3, or, hydrazinium, n, 2, h, 5, and, y, is, a, trivalent, metal, ion, such, as, aluminium, chromium, titanium, manganese, vanadium, iron, iii, cobalt, gallium, molybdenum, indium, ruthenium, rhodium, or, iridium, analogous, selenates, also, occur, the, possible, combinations, of, univalent, cation, trivalent, cation, and, anion, depends, on, the, sizes, of, the, ions, a, tutton, salt, is, a, double, sulfate, of, the, typical, formula, x, 2, so, 4, y, so, 4, 6h, 2, o, where, x, is, a, monovalent, cation, and, y, a, divalent, metal, ion, double, sulfates, of, the, composition, x, 2, so, 4, 2, y, so, 4, such, that, x, is, a, monovalent, cation, and, y, is, a, divalent, metal, ion, are, referred, to, as, langbeinites, after, the, prototypical, potassium, magnesium, sulfate
