syngas, or, synthesis, gas, is, a, mixture, of, hydrogen, and, carbon, monoxide, in, various, ratios, the, gas, often, contains, some, carbon, dioxide, and, methane, it, is, principally, used, for, producing, ammonia, or, methanol, syngas, is, combustible, and, can, be, used, as, a, fuel, historically, it, has, been, used, as, a, replacement, for, gasoline, when, gasoline, supply, has, been, limited, for, example, wood, gas, was, used, to, power, cars, in, europe, during, wwii, in, germany, alone, half, a, million, cars, were, built, or, rebuilt, to, run, on, wood, gas, syngas, is, produced, by, steam, reforming, or, partial, oxidation, of, natural, gas, or, liquid, hydrocarbons, or, coal, gasification, c, h, 2, o, co, h, 2, co, h, 2, o, co, 2, h, 2, c, co, 2, 2co, steam, reforming, of, methane, is, an, endothermic, reaction, requiring, 206, kj, mol, of, methane, in, principle, but, rarely, in, practice, biomass, and, related, hydrocarbon, feedstocks, could, be, used, to, generate, biogas, and, biochar, in, waste, to, energy, gasification, facilities, the, gas, generated, mostly, methane, and, carbon, dioxide, is, sometimes, described, as, syngas, but, its, composition, differs, from, syngas, generation, of, conventional, syngas, mostly, h, 2, and, co, from, waste, biomass, has, been, explored, the, chemical, composition, of, syngas, varies, based, on, the, raw, materials, and, the, processes, syngas, produced, by, coal, gasification, generally, is, a, mixture, of, 30, to, 60, carbon, monoxide, 25, to, 30, hydrogen, 5, to, 15, carbon, dioxide, and, 0, to, 5, methane, it, also, contains, lesser, amount, of, other, gases, syngas, has, less, than, half, the, energy, density, of, natural, gas, the, first, reaction, between, incandescent, coke, and, steam, is, strongly, endothermic, producing, carbon, monoxide, co, and, hydrogen, h, 2, water, gas, in, older, terminology, when, the, coke, bed, has, cooled, to, a, temperature, at, which, the, endothermic, reaction, can, no, longer, proceed, the, steam, is, then, replaced, by, a, blast, of, air, the, second, and, third, reactions, then, take, place, producing, an, exothermic, reaction, forming, initially, carbon, dioxide, and, raising, the, temperature, of, the, coke, bed, followed, by, the, second, endothermic, reaction, in, which, the, latter, is, converted, to, carbon, monoxide, the, overall, reaction, is, exothermic, forming, producer, gas, older, terminology, steam, can, then, be, re, injected, then, air, etc, to, give, an, endless, series, of, cycles, until, the, coke, is, finally, consumed, producer, gas, has, a, much, lower, energy, value, relative, to, water, gas, due, primarily, to, dilution, with, atmospheric, nitrogen, pure, oxygen, can, be, substituted, for, air, to, avoid, the, dilution, effect, producing, gas, of, much, higher, calorific, value, in, order, to, produce, more, hydrogen, from, this, mixture, more, steam, is, added, and, the, water, gas, shift, reaction, is, carried, out, the, hydrogen, can, be, separated, from, the, co, 2, by, pressure, swing, adsorption, psa, amine, scrubbing, and, membrane, reactors, a, variety, of, alternative, technologies, have, been, investigated, but, none, are, of, commercial, value, some, variations, focus, on, new, stoichiometries, such, as, carbon, dioxide, plus, methane, or, partial, hydrogenation, of, carbon, dioxide, other, research, focuses, on, novel, energy, sources, to, drive, the, processes, including, electrolysis, solar, energy, microwaves, and, electric, arcs, electricity, generated, from, renewable, sources, is, also, used, to, process, carbon, dioxide, and, water, into, syngas, through, high, temperature, electrolysis, this, is, an, attempt, to, maintain, carbon, neutrality, in, the, generation, process, audi, in, partnership, with, company, named, sunfire, opened, a, pilot, plant, in, november, 2014, to, generate, e, diesel, using, this, process, syngas, that, is, not, methanized, typically, has, a, lower, heating, value, of, 120, btu, scf, untreated, syngas, can, be, run, in, hybrid, turbines, that, allow, for, greater, efficiency, because, of, their, lower, operating, temperatures, and, extended, part, lifetime, syngas, is, used, as, a, source, of, hydrogen, as, well, as, a, fuel, it, is, also, used, to, directly, reduce, iron, ore, to, sponge, iron, chemical, uses, include, the, production, of, methanol, which, is, a, precursor, to, acetic, acid, and, many, acetates, liquid, fuels, and, lubricants, via, the, fischer, tropsch, process, and, previously, the, mobil, methanol, to, gasoline, process, ammonia, via, the, haber, process, which, converts, atmospheric, nitrogen, n, 2, into, ammonia, which, is, used, as, a, fertilizer, and, oxo, alcohols, via, an, intermediate, aldehyde
