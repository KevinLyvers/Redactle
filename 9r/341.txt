a, synthetic, element, is, one, of, 24, known, chemical, elements, that, do, not, occur, naturally, on, earth, they, have, been, created, by, human, manipulation, of, fundamental, particles, in, a, nuclear, reactor, a, particle, accelerator, or, the, explosion, of, an, atomic, bomb, thus, they, are, called, synthetic, artificial, or, man, made, the, synthetic, elements, are, those, with, atomic, numbers, 95, 118, as, shown, in, purple, on, the, accompanying, periodic, table, these, 24, elements, were, first, created, between, 1944, and, 2010, the, mechanism, for, the, creation, of, a, synthetic, element, is, to, force, additional, protons, into, the, nucleus, of, an, element, with, an, atomic, number, lower, than, 95, all, known, see, island, of, stability, synthetic, elements, are, unstable, but, they, decay, at, widely, varying, rates, the, half, lives, of, their, longest, lived, isotopes, range, from, microseconds, to, millions, of, years, five, more, elements, that, were, first, created, artificially, are, strictly, speaking, not, synthetic, because, they, were, later, found, in, nature, in, trace, quantities, 43, tc, 61, pm, 85, at, 93, np, and, 94, pu, though, are, sometimes, classified, as, synthetic, alongside, exclusively, artificial, elements, the, first, technetium, was, created, in, 1937, plutonium, pu, atomic, number, 94, first, synthesized, in, 1940, is, another, such, element, it, is, the, element, with, the, largest, number, of, protons, atomic, number, to, occur, in, nature, but, it, does, so, in, such, tiny, quantities, that, it, is, far, more, practical, to, synthesize, it, plutonium, is, known, mainly, for, its, use, in, atomic, bombs, and, nuclear, reactors, no, elements, with, atomic, numbers, greater, than, 99, have, any, uses, outside, of, scientific, research, since, they, have, extremely, short, half, lives, and, thus, have, never, been, produced, in, large, quantities, all, elements, with, atomic, number, greater, than, 94, decay, quickly, enough, into, lighter, elements, such, that, any, atoms, of, these, that, may, have, existed, when, the, earth, formed, about, 4, 6, billion, years, ago, have, long, since, decayed, synthetic, elements, now, present, on, earth, are, the, product, of, atomic, bombs, or, experiments, that, involve, nuclear, reactors, or, particle, accelerators, via, nuclear, fusion, or, neutron, absorption, atomic, mass, for, natural, elements, is, based, on, weighted, average, abundance, of, natural, isotopes, in, earth, s, crust, and, atmosphere, for, synthetic, elements, there, is, no, natural, isotope, abundance, therefore, for, synthetic, elements, the, total, nucleon, count, protons, plus, neutrons, of, the, most, stable, isotope, i, e, the, isotope, with, the, longest, half, life, is, listed, in, brackets, as, the, atomic, mass, the, first, element, to, be, synthesized, rather, than, discovered, in, nature, was, technetium, in, 1937, this, discovery, filled, a, gap, in, the, periodic, table, and, the, fact, that, technetium, has, no, stable, isotopes, explains, its, natural, absence, on, earth, and, the, gap, with, the, longest, lived, isotope, of, technetium, 97, tc, having, a, 4, 21, million, year, half, life, no, technetium, remains, from, the, formation, of, the, earth, only, minute, traces, of, technetium, occur, naturally, in, earth, s, crust, as, a, product, of, spontaneous, fission, of, 238, u, or, from, neutron, capture, in, molybdenum, but, technetium, is, present, naturally, in, red, giant, stars, the, first, entirely, synthetic, element, to, be, made, was, curium, synthesized, in, 1944, by, glenn, t, seaborg, ralph, a, james, and, albert, ghiorso, by, bombarding, plutonium, with, alpha, particles, synthesis, of, americium, berkelium, and, californium, followed, soon, einsteinium, and, fermium, were, discovered, by, a, team, of, scientists, led, by, albert, ghiorso, in, 1952, while, studying, the, composition, of, radioactive, debris, from, the, detonation, of, the, first, hydrogen, bomb, the, isotopes, synthesized, were, einsteinium, 253, with, a, half, life, of, 20, 5, days, and, fermium, 255, with, a, half, life, of, about, 20, hours, the, creation, of, mendelevium, nobelium, and, lawrencium, followed, during, the, height, of, the, cold, war, teams, from, the, soviet, union, and, the, united, states, independently, created, rutherfordium, and, dubnium, the, naming, and, credit, for, synthesis, of, these, elements, remained, unresolved, for, many, years, but, eventually, shared, credit, was, recognized, by, iupac, iupap, in, 1992, in, 1997, iupac, decided, to, give, dubnium, its, current, name, honoring, the, city, of, dubna, where, the, russian, team, worked, since, american, chosen, names, had, already, been, used, for, many, existing, synthetic, elements, while, the, name, rutherfordium, chosen, by, the, american, team, was, accepted, for, element, 104, meanwhile, the, american, team, had, created, seaborgium, and, the, next, six, elements, had, been, created, by, a, german, team, bohrium, hassium, meitnerium, darmstadtium, roentgenium, and, copernicium, element, 113, nihonium, was, created, by, a, japanese, team, the, last, five, known, elements, flerovium, moscovium, livermorium, tennessine, and, oganesson, were, created, by, russian, american, collaborations, and, complete, the, seventh, row, of, the, periodic, table, the, following, elements, do, not, occur, naturally, on, earth, all, are, transuranium, elements, and, have, atomic, numbers, of, 95, and, higher, all, elements, with, atomic, numbers, 1, through, 94, occur, naturally, at, least, in, trace, quantities, but, the, following, elements, are, often, produced, through, synthesis, technetium, promethium, astatine, neptunium, and, plutonium, were, discovered, through, synthesis, before, being, found, in, nature
