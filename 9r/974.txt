in, physics, equations, of, motion, are, equations, that, describe, the, behavior, of, a, physical, system, in, terms, of, its, motion, as, a, function, of, time, more, specifically, the, equations, of, motion, describe, the, behavior, of, a, physical, system, as, a, set, of, mathematical, functions, in, terms, of, dynamic, variables, these, variables, are, usually, spatial, coordinates, and, time, but, may, include, momentum, components, the, most, general, choice, are, generalized, coordinates, which, can, be, any, convenient, variables, characteristic, of, the, physical, system, the, functions, are, defined, in, a, euclidean, space, in, classical, mechanics, but, are, replaced, by, curved, spaces, in, relativity, if, the, dynamics, of, a, system, is, known, the, equations, are, the, solutions, for, the, differential, equations, describing, the, motion, of, the, dynamics, there, are, two, main, descriptions, of, motion, dynamics, and, kinematics, dynamics, is, general, since, the, momenta, forces, and, energy, of, the, particles, are, taken, into, account, in, this, instance, sometimes, the, term, dynamics, refers, to, the, differential, equations, that, the, system, satisfies, e, g, newton, s, second, law, or, euler, lagrange, equations, and, sometimes, to, the, solutions, to, those, equations, however, kinematics, is, simpler, it, concerns, only, variables, derived, from, the, positions, of, objects, and, time, in, circumstances, of, constant, acceleration, these, simpler, equations, of, motion, are, usually, referred, to, as, the, suvat, equations, arising, from, the, definitions, of, kinematic, quantities, displacement, s, initial, velocity, u, final, velocity, v, acceleration, a, and, time, t, a, differential, equation, of, motion, usually, identified, as, some, physical, law, for, example, f, ma, and, applying, definitions, of, physical, quantities, is, used, to, set, up, an, equation, for, the, problem, solving, the, differential, equation, will, lead, to, a, general, solution, with, arbitrary, constants, the, arbitrariness, corresponding, to, a, family, of, solutions, a, particular, solution, can, be, obtained, by, setting, the, initial, values, which, fixes, the, values, of, the, constants, to, state, this, formally, in, general, an, equation, of, motion, m, is, a, function, of, the, position, r, of, the, object, its, velocity, the, first, time, derivative, of, r, v, d, r, dt, and, its, acceleration, the, second, derivative, of, r, a, d, 2, r, dt, 2, and, time, t, euclidean, vectors, in, 3d, are, denoted, throughout, in, bold, this, is, equivalent, to, saying, an, equation, of, motion, in, r, is, a, second, order, ordinary, differential, equation, ode, in, r, m, r, t, r, t, r, t, t, 0, displaystyle, m, left, 0, where, t, is, time, and, each, overdot, denotes, one, time, derivative, the, initial, conditions, are, given, by, the, constant, values, at, t, 0, r, 0, r, 0, displaystyle, mathbf, r, 0, quad, mathbf, dot, r, 0, the, solution, r, t, to, the, equation, of, motion, with, specified, initial, values, describes, the, system, for, all, times, t, after, t, 0, other, dynamical, variables, like, the, momentum, p, of, the, object, or, quantities, derived, from, r, and, p, like, angular, momentum, can, be, used, in, place, of, r, as, the, quantity, to, solve, for, from, some, equation, of, motion, although, the, position, of, the, object, at, time, t, is, by, far, the, most, sought, after, quantity, sometimes, the, equation, will, be, linear, and, is, more, likely, to, be, exactly, solvable, in, general, the, equation, will, be, non, linear, and, cannot, be, solved, exactly, so, a, variety, of, approximations, must, be, used, the, solutions, to, nonlinear, equations, may, show, chaotic, behavior, depending, on, how, sensitive, the, system, is, to, the, initial, conditions, kinematics, dynamics, and, the, mathematical, models, of, the, universe, developed, incrementally, over, three, millennia, thanks, to, many, thinkers, only, some, of, whose, names, we, know, in, antiquity, priests, astrologers, and, astronomers, predicted, solar, and, lunar, eclipses, the, solstices, and, the, equinoxes, of, the, sun, and, the, period, of, the, moon, but, they, had, nothing, other, than, a, set, of, algorithms, to, guide, them, equations, of, motion, were, not, written, down, for, another, thousand, years, medieval, scholars, in, the, thirteenth, century, for, example, at, the, relatively, new, universities, in, oxford, and, paris, drew, on, ancient, mathematicians, euclid, and, archimedes, and, philosophers, aristotle, to, develop, a, new, body, of, knowledge, now, called, physics, at, oxford, merton, college, sheltered, a, group, of, scholars, devoted, to, natural, science, mainly, physics, astronomy, and, mathematics, who, were, of, similar, stature, to, the, intellectuals, at, the, university, of, paris, thomas, bradwardine, extended, aristotelian, quantities, such, as, distance, and, velocity, and, assigned, intensity, and, extension, to, them, bradwardine, suggested, an, exponential, law, involving, force, resistance, distance, velocity, and, time, nicholas, oresme, further, extended, bradwardine, s, arguments, the, merton, school, proved, that, the, quantity, of, motion, of, a, body, undergoing, a, uniformly, accelerated, motion, is, equal, to, the, quantity, of, a, uniform, motion, at, the, speed, achieved, halfway, through, the, accelerated, motion, for, writers, on, kinematics, before, galileo, since, small, time, intervals, could, not, be, measured, the, affinity, between, time, and, motion, was, obscure, they, used, time, as, a, function, of, distance, and, in, free, fall, greater, velocity, as, a, result, of, greater, elevation, only, domingo, de, soto, a, spanish, theologian, in, his, commentary, on, aristotle, s, physics, published, in, 1545, after, defining, uniform, difform, motion, which, is, uniformly, accelerated, motion, the, word, velocity, was, not, used, as, proportional, to, time, declared, correctly, that, this, kind, of, motion, was, identifiable, with, freely, falling, bodies, and, projectiles, without, his, proving, these, propositions, or, suggesting, a, formula, relating, time, velocity, and, distance, de, soto, s, comments, are, remarkably, correct, regarding, the, definitions, of, acceleration, acceleration, was, a, rate, of, change, of, motion, velocity, in, time, and, the, observation, that, acceleration, would, be, negative, during, ascent, discourses, such, as, these, spread, throughout, europe, shaping, the, work, of, galileo, galilei, and, others, and, helped, in, laying, the, foundation, of, kinematics, galileo, deduced, the, equation, s, 1, 2, gt, 2, in, his, work, geometrically, using, the, merton, rule, now, known, as, a, special, case, of, one, of, the, equations, of, kinematics, galileo, was, the, first, to, show, that, the, path, of, a, projectile, is, a, parabola, galileo, had, an, understanding, of, centrifugal, force, and, gave, a, correct, definition, of, momentum, this, emphasis, of, momentum, as, a, fundamental, quantity, in, dynamics, is, of, prime, importance, he, measured, momentum, by, the, product, of, velocity, and, weight, mass, is, a, later, concept, developed, by, huygens, and, newton, in, the, swinging, of, a, simple, pendulum, galileo, says, in, discourses, that, every, momentum, acquired, in, the, descent, along, an, arc, is, equal, to, that, which, causes, the, same, moving, body, to, ascend, through, the, same, arc, his, analysis, on, projectiles, indicates, that, galileo, had, grasped, the, first, law, and, the, second, law, of, motion, he, did, not, generalize, and, make, them, applicable, to, bodies, not, subject, to, the, earth, s, gravitation, that, step, was, newton, s, contribution, the, term, inertia, was, used, by, kepler, who, applied, it, to, bodies, at, rest, the, first, law, of, motion, is, now, often, called, the, law, of, inertia, galileo, did, not, fully, grasp, the, third, law, of, motion, the, law, of, the, equality, of, action, and, reaction, though, he, corrected, some, errors, of, aristotle, with, stevin, and, others, galileo, also, wrote, on, statics, he, formulated, the, principle, of, the, parallelogram, of, forces, but, he, did, not, fully, recognize, its, scope, galileo, also, was, interested, by, the, laws, of, the, pendulum, his, first, observations, of, which, were, as, a, young, man, in, 1583, while, he, was, praying, in, the, cathedral, at, pisa, his, attention, was, arrested, by, the, motion, of, the, great, lamp, lighted, and, left, swinging, referencing, his, own, pulse, for, time, keeping, to, him, the, period, appeared, the, same, even, after, the, motion, had, greatly, diminished, discovering, the, isochronism, of, the, pendulum, more, careful, experiments, carried, out, by, him, later, and, described, in, his, discourses, revealed, the, period, of, oscillation, varies, with, the, square, root, of, length, but, is, independent, of, the, mass, the, pendulum, thus, we, arrive, at, ren, descartes, isaac, newton, gottfried, leibniz, et, al, and, the, evolved, forms, of, the, equations, of, motion, that, begin, to, be, recognized, as, the, modern, ones, later, the, equations, of, motion, also, appeared, in, electrodynamics, when, describing, the, motion, of, charged, particles, in, electric, and, magnetic, fields, the, lorentz, force, is, the, general, equation, which, serves, as, the, definition, of, what, is, meant, by, an, electric, field, and, magnetic, field, with, the, advent, of, special, relativity, and, general, relativity, the, theoretical, modifications, to, spacetime, meant, the, classical, equations, of, motion, were, also, modified, to, account, for, the, finite, speed, of, light, and, curvature, of, spacetime, in, all, these, cases, the, differential, equations, were, in, terms, of, a, function, describing, the, particle, s, trajectory, in, terms, of, space, and, time, coordinates, as, influenced, by, forces, or, energy, transformations, however, the, equations, of, quantum, mechanics, can, also, be, considered, equations, of, motion, since, they, are, differential, equations, of, the, wavefunction, which, describes, how, a, quantum, state, behaves, analogously, using, the, space, and, time, coordinates, of, the, particles, there, are, analogs, of, equations, of, motion, in, other, areas, of, physics, for, collections, of, physical, phenomena, that, can, be, considered, waves, fluids, or, fields, from, the, instantaneous, position, r, r, t, instantaneous, meaning, at, an, instant, value, of, time, t, the, instantaneous, velocity, v, v, t, and, acceleration, a, a, t, have,

derivatives, are, related, to, tangents, of, curves, still, for, curved, paths, the, acceleration, is, directed, towards, the, center, of, curvature, of, the, path, again, loosely, speaking, second, order, derivatives, are, related, to, curvature, the, rotational, analogues, are, the, angular, vector, angle, the, particle, rotates, about, some, axis, t, angular, velocity, t, and, angular,

point, like, particle, orbiting, about, some, axis, with, angular, velocity, v, r, displaystyle, mathbf, v, boldsymbol, omega, times, mathbf, r, where, r, is, the, position, vector, of, the, particle, radial, from, the, rotation, axis, and, v, the, tangential, velocity, of, the, particle, for, a, rotating, continuum, rigid, body, these, relations, hold, for, each, point, in, the, rigid, body, the, differential, equation, of, motion, for, a, particle, of, constant, or, uniform, acceleration, in, a, straight, line, is, simple, the, acceleration, is, constant, so, the, second, derivative, of, the, position, of, the, object, is, constant, the, results, of, this, case, are, summarized, below, these, equations, apply, to, a, particle, moving, linearly, in, three, dimensions, in, a, straight, line, with, constant, acceleration, since, the, position, velocity, and, acceleration, are, collinear, parallel, and, lie, on, the, same, line, only, the, magnitudes, of, these, vectors, are, necessary, and, because, the, motion, is, along, a, straight, line, the, problem, effectively, reduces, from, three, dimensions, to, one, v, a, t, v, 0, 1, r, r, 0, v, 0, t, 1, 2, a, t, 2, 2, r, r, 0, 1, 2, v,

the, rate, of, change, of, momentum, p, p, t, m, v, t, of, an, object, equals, the, force, f, f, x, t, v, t, t, acting, on, it, 1112, f, d, p, d, t, displaystyle, mathbf, f, frac, d, mathbf, p, dt, the, force, in, the, equation, is, not, the, force, the, object, exerts, replacing, momentum, by, mass, times, velocity, the, law, is, also, written, more, famously, as, f, m, a, displaystyle, mathbf, f, m, mathbf, a, since, m, is, a, constant, in, newtonian, mechanics, newton, s, second, law, applies, to, point, like, particles, and, to, all, points, in, a, rigid, body, they, also, apply, to, each, point, in, a, mass, continuum, like, deformable, solids, or, fluids, but, the, motion, of, the, system, must, be, accounted, for, see, material, derivative, in, the, case, the, mass, is, not, constant, it, is, not, sufficient, to, use, the, product, rule, for, the, time, derivative, on, the, mass, and, velocity, and, newton, s, second, law, requires, some, modification, consistent, with, conservation, of, momentum, see, variable, mass, system, it, may, be, simple, to, write, down, the, equations, of, motion, in, vector, form, using, newton, s, laws, of, motion, but, the, components, may, vary, in, complicated, ways, with, spatial, coordinates, and, time, and, solving, them, is, not, easy, often, there, is, an, excess, of, variables, to, solve, for, the, problem, completely, so, newton, s, laws, are, not, always, the, most, efficient, way, to, determine, the, motion, of, a, system, in, simple, cases, of, rectangular, geometry, newton, s, laws, work, fine, in, cartesian, coordinates, but, in, other, coordinate, systems, can, become, dramatically, complex, the, momentum, form, is, preferable, since, this, is, readily, generalized, to, more, complex, systems, such, as, special, and, general, relativity, see, four, momentum, 112, it, can, also, be, used, with, the, momentum, conservation, however, newton, s, laws, are, not, more, fundamental, than, momentum, conservation, because, newton, s, laws, are, merely, consistent, with, the, fact, that, zero, resultant, force, acting, on, an, object, implies, constant, momentum, while, a, resultant, force, implies, the, momentum, is, not, constant, momentum, conservation, is, always, true, for, an, isolated, system, not, subject, to, resultant, forces, for, a, number, of, particles, see, many, body,

part, of, system, particle, i, does, not, exert, a, force, on, itself, euler, s, laws, of, motion, are, similar, to, newton, s, laws, but, they, are, applied, specifically, to, the, motion, of, rigid, bodies, the, newton, euler, equations, combine, the, forces, and, torques, acting, on, a, rigid, body, into, a, single, equation, newton, s, second, law, for, rotation, takes, a, similar, form, to,
