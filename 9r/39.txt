the, gallon, is, a, unit, of, volume, in, british, imperial, units, and, united, states, customary, units, three, different, versions, are, in, current, use, there, are, two, pints, in, a, quart, and, four, quarts, in, a, gallon, different, sizes, of, pints, account, for, the, different, sizes, of, the, imperial, and, us, gallons, the, ieee, standard, symbol, for, both, us, liquid, and, imperial, gallon, is, gal, not, to, be, confused, with, the, gal, symbol, gal, a, cgs, unit, of, acceleration, the, gallon, currently, has, one, definition, in, the, imperial, system, and, two, definitions, liquid, and, dry, in, the, us, customary, system, historically, there, were, many, definitions, and, redefinitions, there, were, a, number, of, systems, of, liquid, measurements, in, the, united, kingdom, prior, to, the, 19th, century, the, british, imperial, gallon, frequently, called, simply, gallon, is, defined, as, exactly, 4, 54609, dm, 3, 4, 54609, litres, it, is, used, in, some, commonwealth, countries, and, until, 1976, was, defined, as, the, volume, of, water, at, 62, f, 16, 67, c, whose, mass, is, 10, pounds, 4, 5359237, kg, there, are, four, imperial, quarts, in, a, gallon, two, imperial, pints, in, a, quart, and, there, are, 20, imperial, fluid, ounces, in, an, imperial, pint, yielding, 160, fluid, ounces, in, an, imperial, gallon, the, us, liquid, gallon, frequently, called, simply, gallon, is, legally, defined, as, 231, cubic, inches, which, is, exactly, 3, 785411784, litres, a, us, liquid, gallon, can, contain, about, 3, 785, kilograms, or, 8, 34, pounds, of, water, at, 3, 98, c, 39, 16, f, and, is, about, 16, 7, less, than, the, imperial, gallon, there, are, four, quarts, in, a, gallon, two, pints, in, a, quart, and, 16, us, fluid, ounces, in, a, us, pint, which, makes, the, us, fluid, ounce, equal, to, 1, 128, of, a, us, gallon, in, order, to, overcome, the, effects, of, expansion, and, contraction, with, temperature, when, using, a, gallon, to, specify, a, quantity, of, material, for, purposes, of, trade, it, is, common, to, define, the, temperature, at, which, the, material, will, occupy, the, specified, volume, for, example, the, volume, of, petroleum, products, and, alcoholic, beverages, are, both, referenced, to, 60, f, 15, 6, c, in, government, regulations, since, the, dry, measure, is, one, eighth, of, a, us, winchester, bushel, of, 2, 150, 42, cubic, inches, it, is, equal, to, exactly, 268, 8025, cubic, inches, which, is, 4, 404, 883, 770, 86, l, the, us, dry, gallon, is, not, used, in, commerce, and, is, also, not, listed, in, the, relevant, statute, which, jumps, from, the, dry, pint, to, the, bushel, as, of, 2021, the, imperial, gallon, continues, to, be, used, as, the, standard, petrol, unit, on, 10, caribbean, island, groups, consisting, of, all, 12, of, the, caribbean, islands, use, miles, per, hour, for, speed, limits, signage, and, drive, on, the, left, side, of, the, road, the, united, arab, emirates, ceased, selling, petrol, by, the, imperial, gallon, in, 2010, and, switched, to, the, litre, with, guyana, following, suit, in, 2013, in, 2014, myanmar, switched, from, the, imperial, gallon, to, the, litre, antigua, and, barbuda, has, proposed, switching, to, selling, petrol, by, litres, since, 2015, in, the, european, union, the, gallon, was, removed, from, the, list, of, legally, defined, primary, units, of, measure, catalogue, in, the, eu, directive, 80, 181, eec, for, trading, and, official, purposes, effective, from, 31, december, 1994, under, the, directive, the, gallon, could, still, be, used, but, only, as, a, supplementary, or, secondary, unit, as, a, result, of, the, eu, directive, ireland, and, the, united, kingdom, passed, legislation, to, replace, the, gallon, with, the, litre, as, a, primary, unit, of, measure, in, trade, and, in, the, conduct, of, public, business, effective, from, 31, december, 1993, and, 30, september, 1995, respectively, though, the, gallon, has, ceased, to, be, a, primary, unit, of, trade, it, can, still, be, legally, used, in, both, the, uk, and, ireland, as, a, supplementary, unit, however, barrels, and, large, containers, of, beer, oil, and, other, fluids, are, commonly, measured, in, multiples, of, an, imperial, gallon, miles, per, imperial, gallon, is, used, as, the, primary, fuel, economy, unit, in, the, united, kingdom, and, as, a, supplementary, unit, in, canada, on, official, documentation, other, than, the, united, states, petrol, is, sold, by, the, us, gallon, in, 13, other, countries, and, one, us, territory, the, latest, country, to, cease, using, the, gallon, is, el, salvador, in, june, 2021, both, the, us, gallon, and, imperial, gallon, are, used, in, the, turks, and, caicos, islands, due, to, an, increase, in, tax, duties, which, was, disguised, by, levying, the, same, duty, on, the, us, gallon, 3, 79, l, as, was, previously, levied, on, the, imperial, gallon, 4, 55, l, and, the, bahamas, in, some, parts, of, the, middle, east, such, as, the, united, arab, emirates, and, bahrain, 18, 9, litre, water, cooler, bottles, are, marketed, as, five, gallon, bottles, both, the, us, liquid, and, imperial, gallon, are, divided, into, four, quarts, quart, er, gallons, which, in, turn, are, divided, into, two, pints, which, in, turn, are, divided, into, two, cups, not, in, customary, use, outside, the, us, which, in, turn, are, further, divided, into, two, gills, thus, both, gallons, are, equal, to, four, quarts, eight, pints, sixteen, cups, or, thirty, two, gills, the, imperial, gill, is, further, divided, into, five, fluid, ounces, whereas, the, us, gill, is, divided, into, four, fluid, ounces, meaning, an, imperial, fluid, ounce, is, 1, 20, of, an, imperial, pint, or, 1, 160, of, an, imperial, gallon, while, a, us, fluid, ounce, is, 1, 16, of, a, us, pint, or, 1, 128, of, a, us, gallon, thus, the, imperial, gallon, quart, pint, cup, and, gill, are, approximately, 20, larger, than, their, us, counterparts, meaning, these, are, not, interchangeable, but, the, imperial, fluid, ounce, is, only, approximately, 4, smaller, than, the, us, fluid, ounce, meaning, these, are, often, used, interchangeably, historically, a, common, bottle, size, for, liquor, in, the, us, was, the, fifth, i, e, one, fifth, of, a, us, gallon, or, one, sixth, of, an, imperial, gallon, while, spirit, sales, in, the, us, were, switched, to, metric, measures, in, 1976, a, 750, ml, bottle, is, still, sometimes, known, as, a, fifth, the, term, derives, most, immediately, from, galun, galon, in, old, norman, french, but, the, usage, was, common, in, several, languages, for, example, jale, in, old, french, and, g, llet, bowl, in, old, english, this, suggests, a, common, origin, in, romance, latin, but, the, ultimate, source, of, the, word, is, unknown, the, gallon, originated, as, the, base, of, systems, for, measuring, wine, and, beer, in, england, the, sizes, of, gallon, used, in, these, two, systems, were, different, from, each, other, the, first, was, based, on, the, wine, gallon, equal, in, size, to, the, us, gallon, and, the, second, one, either, the, ale, gallon, or, the, larger, imperial, gallon, by, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, there, were, three, definitions, of, the, gallon, in, common, use, the, corn, or, dry, gallon, is, used, along, with, the, dry, quart, and, pint, in, the, united, states, for, grain, and, other, dry, commodities, it, is, one, eighth, of, the, winchester, bushel, originally, defined, as, a, cylindrical, measure, of, 18, 1, 2, inches, in, diameter, and, 8, inches, in, depth, which, made, the, bushel, 8, in, 9, 1, 4, in, 2, 2150, 42017, cubic, inches, the, bushel, was, later, defined, to, be, 2150, 42, cubic, inches, exactly, thus, making, its, gallon, exactly, 268, 8025, in, 3, 4, 404, 883, 770, 86, l, in, previous, centuries, there, had, been, a, corn, gallon, of, between, 271, and, 272, cubic, inches, the, wine, fluid, or, liquid, gallon, has, been, the, standard, us, gallon, since, the, early, 19th, century, the, wine, gallon, which, some, sources, relate, to, the, volume, occupied, by, eight, medieval, merchant, pounds, of, wine, was, at, one, time, defined, as, the, volume, of, a, cylinder, 6, inches, deep, and, 7, inches, in, diameter, i, e, 6, in, 3, 1, 2, in, 2, 230, 907, 06, cubic, inches, it, was, redefined, during, the, reign, of, queen, anne, in, 1706, as, 231, cubic, inches, exactly, the, earlier, definition, with, approximated, to, 22, 7, r, 2, h, 22, 7, 7, i, n, 2, 2, 6, i, n, 231, i, n, 3, displaystyle, pi, r, 2, h, approx, frac, 22, 7, times, left, frac, 7, mathrm, in, 2, right, 2, times, 6, mathrm, in, 231, mathrm, in, 3, although, the, wine, gallon, had, been, used, for, centuries, for, import, duty, purposes, there, was, no, legal, standard, of, it, in, the, exchequer, while, a, smaller, gallon, 224, cu, in, was, actually, in, use, requiring, this, statute, the, 231, cubic, inch, gallon, remains, the, us, definition, today, in, 1824, britain, adopted, a, close, approximation, to, the, ale, gallon, known, as, the, imperial, gallon, and, abolished, all, other, gallons, in, favour, of, it, inspired, by, the, kilogram, litre, relationship, the, imperial, gallon, was, based, on, the, volume, of, 10, pounds, of, distilled, water, weighed, in, air, with, brass, weights, with, the, barometer, standing, at, 30, inches, of, mercury, 14, 7345, pound, force, per, square, inch, and, at, a, temperature, of, 62, f, 17, c, in, 1963, this, definition, was, refined, as, the, space, occupied, by, 10, pounds, of, distilled, water, of, density, 0, 998, 859, g, ml, weighed, in, air, of, density, 0, 001, 217, g, ml, against, weights, of, density, 8, 136, g, ml, the, original, brass, was, refined, as, the, densities, of, brass, alloys, vary, depending, on, metallurgical, composition, which, was, calculated, as, 4, 546, 091, 879, l, to, ten, significant, figures, the, precise, definition, of, exactly, 4, 546, 09, cubic, decimetres, also, 4, 546, 09, l, 277, 419, 433, in, 3, came, after, the, litre, was, redefined, in, 1964, this, was, adopted, shortly, afterwards, in, canada, and, adopted, in, 1976, in, the, united, kingdom, historically, gallons, of, various, sizes, were, used, in, many, parts, of, western, europe, in, these, localities, it, has, been, replaced, as, the, unit, of, capacity, by, the, litre
