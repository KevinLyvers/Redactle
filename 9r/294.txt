in, chemistry, the, amount, of, substance, symbol, n, in, a, given, sample, of, matter, is, defined, as, a, ratio, n, n, n, a, between, the, number, of, elementary, entities, n, and, the, avogadro, constant, n, a, the, entities, are, usually, molecules, atoms, ions, or, ion, pairs, of, a, specified, kind, the, particular, substance, sampled, may, be, specified, using, a, subscript, e, g, the, amount, of, sodium, chloride, nacl, would, be, denoted, as, n, nacl, the, unit, of, amount, of, substance, in, the, international, system, of, units, is, the, mole, symbol, mol, a, base, unit, since, 2019, the, value, of, the, avogadro, constant, n, a, is, defined, to, be, exactly, 6, 022, 140, 76, 10, 23, mol, 1, sometimes, the, amount, of, substance, is, referred, to, as, the, chemical, amount, or, informally, as, the, number, of, moles, in, a, given, sample, of, matter, historically, the, mole, was, defined, as, the, amount, of, substance, in, 12, grams, of, the, carbon, 12, isotope, as, a, consequence, the, mass, of, one, mole, of, a, chemical, compound, in, grams, is, numerically, equal, for, all, practical, purposes, to, the, mass, of, one, molecule, or, formula, unit, of, the, compound, in, daltons, and, the, molar, mass, of, an, isotope, in, grams, per, mole, is, approximately, equal, to, the, mass, number, historically, exact, for, carbon, 12, with, a, molar, mass, of, 12, g, mol, for, example, a, molecule, of, water, has, a, mass, of, about, 18, 015, daltons, on, average, whereas, a, mole, of, water, which, contains, 6, 022, 140, 76, 10, 23, water, molecules, has, a, total, mass, of, about, 18, 015, grams, in, chemistry, because, of, the, law, of, multiple, proportions, it, is, often, much, more, convenient, to, work, with, amounts, of, substances, that, is, number, of, moles, or, of, molecules, than, with, masses, grams, or, volumes, liters, for, example, the, chemical, fact, 1, molecule, of, oxygen, o, 2, will, react, with, 2, molecules, of, hydrogen, h, 2, to, make, 2, molecules, of, water, h, 2, o, can, also, be, stated, as, 1, mole, of, o, 2, will, react, with, 2, moles, of, h, 2, to, form, 2, moles, of, water, the, same, chemical, fact, expressed, in, terms, of, masses, would, be, 32, g, 1, mole, of, oxygen, will, react, with, approximately, 4, 0304, g, 2, moles, of, h, 2, hydrogen, to, make, approximately, 36, 0304, g, 2, moles, of, water, and, the, numbers, would, depend, on, the, isotopic, composition, of, the, reagents, in, terms, of, volume, the, numbers, would, depend, on, the, pressure, and, temperature, of, the, reagents, and, products, for, the, same, reasons, the, concentrations, of, reagents, and, products, in, solution, are, often, specified, in, moles, per, liter, rather, than, grams, per, liter, the, amount, of, substance, is, also, a, convenient, concept, in, thermodynamics, for, example, the, pressure, of, a, certain, quantity, of, a, noble, gas, in, a, recipient, of, a, given, volume, at, a, given, temperature, is, directly, related, to, the, number, of, molecules, in, the, gas, through, the, ideal, gas, law, not, to, its, mass, this, technical, sense, of, the, term, amount, of, substance, should, not, be, confused, with, the, general, sense, of, amount, in, the, english, language, the, latter, may, refer, to, other, measurements, such, as, mass, or, volume, rather, than, the, number, of, particles, there, are, proposals, to, replace, amount, of, substance, with, more, easily, distinguishable, terms, such, as, enplethy, and, stoichiometric, amount, the, iupac, recommends, that, amount, of, substance, should, be, used, instead, of, number, of, moles, just, as, the, quantity, mass, should, not, be, called, number, of, kilograms, to, avoid, ambiguity, the, nature, of, the, particles, should, be, specified, in, any, measurement, of, the, amount, of, substance, thus, a, sample, of, 1, mol, of, molecules, of, oxygen, o, 2, has, a, mass, of, about, 32, grams, whereas, a, sample, of, 1, mol, of, atoms, of, oxygen, o, has, a, mass, of, about, 16, grams, the, quotient, of, some, extensive, physical, quantity, of, a, homogeneous, sample, by, its, amount, of, substance, is, an, intensive, property, of, the, substance, usually, named, by, the, prefix, molar, or, the, suffix, per, mole, for, example, the, quotient, of, the, mass, of, a, sample, by, its, amount, of, substance, is, its, molar, mass, for, which, the, si, unit, kilogram, per, mole, or, gram, per, mole, may, be, used, this, is, about, 18, 015, g, mol, for, water, and, 55, 845, g, mol, for, iron, similarly, for, volume, one, gets, the, molar, volume, which, is, about, 18, 069, millilitres, per, mole, for, liquid, water, and, 7, 092, ml, mol, for, iron, at, room, temperature, from, the, heat, capacity, one, gets, the, molar, heat, capacity, which, is, about, 75, 385, j, k, mol, for, water, and, about, 25, 10, j, k, mol, for, iron, the, molar, mass, m, displaystyle, m, of, a, substance, is, the, ratio, of, the, mass, m, displaystyle, m, of, a, sample, of, that, substance, to, its, amount, of, substance, n, displaystyle, n, m, m, n, displaystyle, m, m, n, the, amount, of, substance, is, given, as, the, number, of, moles, in, the, sample, for, most, practical, purposes, the, numerical, value, of, the, molar, mass, in, grams, per, mole, is, the, same, as, that, of, the, mean, mass, of, one, molecule, or, formula, unit, of, the, substance, in, daltons, as, the, mole, was, historically, defined, such, that, the, molar, mass, constant, was, exactly, 1, g, mol, thus, given, the, molecular, mass, or, formula, mass, in, daltons, the, same, number, in, grams, gives, an, amount, very, close, to, one, mole, of, the, substance, for, example, the, average, molecular, mass, of, water, is, about, 18, 015, da, and, the, molar, mass, of, water, is, about, 18, 015, g, mol, this, allows, for, accurate, determination, of, the, amount, in, moles, of, a, substance, by, measuring, its, mass, and, dividing, by, the, molar, mass, of, the, compound, n, m, m, displaystyle, n, m, m, for, example, 100, g, of, water, is, about, 5, 551, mol, of, water, other, methods, of, determining, the, amount, of, substance, include, the, use, of, the, molar, volume, or, the, measurement, of, electric, charge, the, molar, mass, of, a, substance, depends, not, only, on, its, molecular, formula, but, also, on, the, distribution, of, isotopes, of, each, chemical, element, present, in, it, for, example, the, molar, mass, of, calcium, 40, is, 39, 962, 590, 98, 22, g, mol, whereas, the, molar, mass, of, calcium, 42, is, 41, 958, 618, 01, 27, g, mol, and, of, calcium, with, the, normal, isotopic, mix, is, 40, 078, 4, g, mol, another, important, derived, quantity, is, the, molar, concentration, c, displaystyle, c, also, called, amount, of, substance, concentration, amount, concentration, or, substance, concentration, especially, in, clinical, chemistry, defined, as, the, amount, in, moles, n, displaystyle, n, of, a, specific, substance, solute, in, a, solution, or, component, of, a, mixture, divided, by, the, volume, v, displaystyle, v, of, the, solution, or, mixture, c, n, v, displaystyle, c, n, v, the, standard, si, unit, of, this, quantity, is, mol, m, 3, although, more, practical, units, are, commonly, used, such, as, mole, per, liter, mol, l, equivalent, to, mol, dm, 3, for, example, the, amount, concentration, of, sodium, chloride, in, ocean, water, is, typically, about, 0, 599, mol, l, the, denominator, is, the, volume, of, the, solution, not, of, the, solvent, thus, for, example, one, liter, of, standard, vodka, contains, about, 0, 40, l, of, ethanol, 315, g, 6, 85, mol, and, 0, 60, l, of, water, the, amount, concentration, of, ethanol, is, therefore, 6, 85, mol, of, ethanol, 1, l, of, vodka, 6, 85, mol, l, not, 6, 85, mol, of, ethanol, 0, 60, l, of, water, which, would, be, 11, 4, mol, l, in, chemistry, it, is, customary, to, read, the, unit, mol, l, as, molar, and, denote, it, by, the, symbol, m, both, following, the, numeric, value, thus, for, example, each, liter, of, a, 0, 5, molar, or, 0, 5, m, solution, of, urea, ch, 4, n, 2, o, in, water, contains, 0, 5, moles, of, that, molecule, by, extension, the, amount, concentration, is, also, commonly, called, the, molarity, of, the, substance, of, interest, in, the, solution, however, as, of, may, 2007, these, terms, and, symbols, are, not, condoned, by, iupac, this, quantity, should, not, be, confused, with, the, mass, concentration, which, is, the, mass, of, the, substance, of, interest, divided, by, the, volume, of, the, solution, about, 35, g, l, for, sodium, chloride, in, ocean, water, confusingly, the, amount, molar, concentration, should, also, be, distinguished, from, the, molar, fraction, also, called, mole, fraction, or, amount, fraction, of, a, substance, in, a, mixture, such, as, a, solution, which, is, the, number, of, moles, of, the, compound, in, one, sample, of, the, mixture, divided, by, the, total, number, of, moles, of, all, components, for, example, if, 20, g, of, nacl, is, dissolved, in, 100, g, of, water, the, amounts, of, the, two, substances, in, the, solution, will, be, 20, g, 58, 443, g, mol, 0, 34221, mol, and, 100, g, 18, 015, g, mol, 5, 5509, mol, respectively, and, the, molar, fraction, of, nacl, will, be, 0, 34221, 0, 34221, 5, 5509, 0, 05807, in, a, mixture, of, gases, the, partial, pressure, of, each, component, is, proportional, to, its, molar, fraction, the, alchemists, and, especially, the, early, metallurgists, probably, had, some, notion, of, amount, of, substance, but, there, are, no, surviving, records, of, any, generalization, of, the, idea, beyond, a, set, of, recipes, in, 1758, mikhail, lomonosov, questioned, the, idea, that, mass, was, the, only, measure, of, the, quantity, of, matter, but, he, did, so, only, in, relation, to, his, theories, on, gravitation, the, development, of, the, concept, of, amount, of, substance, was, coincidental, with, and, vital, to, the, birth, of, modern, chemistry
