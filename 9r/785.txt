an, iceberg, is, a, piece, of, freshwater, ice, more, than, 15, meters, 16, yards, long, that, has, broken, off, a, glacier, or, an, ice, shelf, and, is, floating, freely, in, open, water, smaller, chunks, of, floating, glacially, derived, ice, are, called, growlers, or, bergy, bits, much, of, an, iceberg, is, below, the, water, s, surface, which, led, to, the, expression, tip, of, the, iceberg, to, illustrate, a, small, part, of, a, larger, unseen, issue, icebergs, are, considered, a, serious, maritime, hazard, icebergs, vary, considerably, in, size, and, shape, icebergs, that, calve, from, glaciers, in, greenland, are, often, irregularly, shaped, while, antarctic, ice, shelves, often, produce, large, tabular, table, top, icebergs, the, largest, iceberg, in, recent, history, named, b, 15, was, measured, at, nearly, 300, by, 40, kilometres, 186, by, 25, mi, in, 2000, the, largest, iceberg, on, record, was, an, antarctic, tabular, iceberg, measuring, 335, by, 97, kilometres, 208, by, 60, mi, sighted, 240, kilometres, 150, mi, west, of, scott, island, in, the, south, pacific, ocean, by, the, uss, glacier, on, november, 12, 1956, this, iceberg, was, larger, than, belgium, the, word, iceberg, is, a, partial, loan, translation, from, the, dutch, word, ijsberg, literally, meaning, ice, mountain, cognate, to, danish, isbjerg, german, eisberg, low, saxon, iesbarg, and, swedish, isberg, typically, about, one, tenth, of, the, volume, of, an, iceberg, is, above, water, which, follows, from, archimedes, s, principle, of, buoyancy, the, density, of, pure, ice, is, about, 920, kg, m, 3, 57, lb, cu, ft, and, that, of, seawater, about, 1, 025, kg, m, 3, 64, lb, cu, ft, the, contour, of, the, underwater, portion, can, be, difficult, to, judge, by, looking, at, the, portion, above, the, surface, the, largest, icebergs, recorded, have, been, calved, or, broken, off, from, the, ross, ice, shelf, of, antarctica, icebergs, may, reach, a, height, of, more, than, 100, metres, 300, ft, above, the, sea, surface, and, have, mass, ranging, from, about, 100, 000, tonnes, up, to, more, than, 10, million, tonnes, icebergs, or, pieces, of, floating, ice, smaller, than, 5, meters, above, the, sea, surface, are, classified, as, bergy, bits, smaller, than, 1, meter, growlers, the, largest, known, iceberg, in, the, north, atlantic, was, 168, metres, 551, ft, above, sea, level, reported, by, the, uscg, icebreaker, eastwind, in, 1958, making, it, the, height, of, a, 55, story, building, these, icebergs, originate, from, the, glaciers, of, western, greenland, and, may, have, interior, temperatures, of, 15, to, 20, c, 5, to, 4, f, a, given, iceberg, s, trajectory, through, the, ocean, can, be, modelled, by, integrating, the, equation, where, m, is, the, iceberg, mass, v, the, drift, velocity, and, the, variables, f, k, and, f, correspond, to, the, coriolis, force, the, vertical, unit, vector, and, a, given, force, the, subscripts, a, w, r, s, and, p, correspond, to, the, air, drag, water, drag, wave, radiation, force, sea, ice, drag, and, the, horizontal, pressure, gradient, force, icebergs, deteriorate, through, melting, and, fracturing, which, changes, the, mass, m, as, well, as, the, surface, area, volume, and, stability, of, the, iceberg, iceberg, deterioration, and, drift, therefore, are, interconnected, ie, iceberg, thermodynamics, and, fracturing, must, be, considered, when, modelling, iceberg, drift, winds, and, currents, may, move, icebergs, close, to, coastlines, where, they, can, become, frozen, into, pack, ice, one, form, of, sea, ice, or, drift, into, shallow, waters, where, they, can, come, into, contact, with, the, seabed, a, phenomenon, called, seabed, gouging, icebergs, lose, mass, due, to, melting, and, calving, melting, can, be, due, to, solar, radiation, or, heat, and, salt, transport, from, the, ocean, iceberg, calving, is, generally, enhanced, by, waves, impacting, the, iceberg, melting, tends, to, be, driven, by, the, ocean, rather, than, solar, radiation, ocean, driven, melting, is, often, modelled, as, where, m, b, displaystyle, m, text, b, is, the, melt, rate, in, m, day, u, displaystyle, delta, u, is, the, relative, velocity, between, the, iceberg, and, the, ocean, t, 0, t, displaystyle, t, 0, t, is, the, temperature, difference, between, the, ocean, and, the, iceberg, and, l, displaystyle, l, is, the, length, of, the, iceberg, k, displaystyle, k, is, a, constant, based, on, properties, of, the, iceberg, and, the, ocean, and, is, approximately, 0, 75, c, 1, m, 0, 4, day, 1, s, 0, 8, displaystyle, 0, 75,

been, demonstrated, in, laboratory, experiments, wave, erosion, is, more, poorly, constrained, but, can, be, estimated, by, where, m, e, displaystyle, m, text, e, is, the, wave, erosion, rate, in, m,

contain, up, to, 10, air, bubbles, by, volume, these, bubbles, are, released, during, melting, producing, a, fizzing, sound, that, some, may, call, bergie, seltzer, this, sound, results, when, the, water, ice, interface, reaches, compressed, air, bubbles, trapped, in, the, ice, as, each, bubble, bursts, it, makes, a, popping, sound, and, the, acoustic, properties, of, these, bubbles, can, be, used, to, study, iceberg, melt, an, iceberg, may, flip, or, capsize, as, it, melts, and, breaks, apart, changing, the, center, of, gravity, capsizing, can, occur, shortly, after, calving, when, the, iceberg, is, young, and, establishing, balance, icebergs, are, unpredictable, and, can, capsize, anytime, and, without, warning, large, icebergs, that, break, off, from, a, glacier, front, and, flip, onto, the, glacier, face, can, push, the, entire, glacier, backwards, momentarily, producing, glacial, earthquakes, that, generate, as, much, energy, as, an, atomic, bomb, icebergs, are, generally, white, because, they, are, covered, in, snow, but, can, be, green, blue, yellow, black, striped, or, even, rainbow, colored, seawater, algae, and, lack, of, air, bubbles, in, the, ice, can, create, diverse, colors, sediment, can, create, the, dirty, black, coloration, present, in, some, icebergs, in, addition, to, size, classification, table, 1, icebergs, can, be, classified, on, the, basis, of, their, shapes, the, two, basic, types, of, iceberg, forms, are, tabular, and, non, tabular, tabular, icebergs, have, steep, sides, and, a, flat, top, much, like, a, plateau, with, a, length, to, height, ratio, of, more, than, 5, 1, this, type, of, iceberg, also, known, as, an, ice, island, can, be, quite, large, as, in, the, case, of, pobeda, ice, island, antarctic, icebergs, formed, by, breaking, off, from, an, ice, shelf, such, as, the, ross, ice, shelf, or, filchner, ronne, ice, shelf, are, typically, tabular, the, largest, icebergs, in, the, world, are, formed, this, way, non, tabular, icebergs, have, different, shapes, and, include, prior, to, 1914, there, was, no, system, in, place, to, track, icebergs, to, guard, ships, against, collisions, despite, fatal, sinkings, of, ships, by, icebergs, in, 1907, ss, kronprinz, wilhelm, a, german, liner, rammed, an, iceberg, and, suffered, a, crushed, bow, but, she, was, still, able, to, complete, her, voyage, the, advent, of, watertight, compartmentalization, in, ship, construction, led, designers, to, declare, their, ships, unsinkable, during, the, 1912, sinking, of, the, titanic, the, iceberg, that, sank, the, titanic, killed, more, than, 1, 500, of, its, estimated, 2, 224, passengers, and, crew, seriously, damaging, the, unsinkable, claim, for, the, remainder, of, the, ice, season, of, that, year, the, united, states, navy, patrolled, the, waters, and, monitored, ice, movements, in, november, 1913, the, international, conference, on, the, safety, of, life, at, sea, met, in, london, to, devise, a, more, permanent, system, of, observing, icebergs, within, three, months, the, participating, maritime, nations, had, formed, the, international, ice, patrol, iip, the, goal, of, the, iip, was, to, collect, data, on, meteorology, and, oceanography, to, measure, currents, ice, flow, ocean, temperature, and, salinity, levels, they, monitored, iceberg, dangers, near, the, grand, banks, of, newfoundland, and, provided, the, limits, of, all, known, ice, in, that, vicinity, to, the, maritime, community, the, iip, published, their, first, records, in, 1921, which, allowed, for, a, year, by, year, comparison, of, iceberg, movement, aerial, surveillance, of, the, seas, in, the, early, 1930s, allowed, for, the, development, of, charter, systems, that, could, accurately, detail, the, ocean, currents, and, iceberg, locations, in, 1945, experiments, tested, the, effectiveness, of, radar, in, detecting, icebergs, a, decade, later, oceanographic, monitoring, outposts, were, established, for, the, purpose, of, collecting, data, these, outposts, continue, to, serve, in, environmental, study, a, computer, was, first, installed, on, a, ship, for, the, purpose, of, oceanographic, monitoring, in, 1964, which, allowed, for, a, faster, evaluation, of, data, by, the, 1970s, ice, breaking, ships, were, equipped, with, automatic, transmissions, of, satellite, photographs, of, ice, in, antarctica, systems, for, optical, satellites, had, been, developed, but, were, still, limited, by, weather, conditions, in, the, 1980s, drifting, buoys, were, used, in, antarctic, waters, for, oceanographic, and, climate, research, they, are, equipped, with, sensors, that, measure, ocean, temperature, and, currents, side, looking, airborne, radar, slar, made, it, possible, to, acquire, images, regardless, of, weather, conditions, on, november, 4, 1995, canada, launched, radarsat, 1, developed, by, the, canadian, space, agency, it, provides, images, of, earth, for, scientific, and, commercial, purposes, this, system, was, the, first, to, use, synthetic, aperture, radar, sar, which, sends, microwave, energy, to, the, ocean, surface, and, records, the, reflections, to, track, icebergs, the, european, space, agency, launched, envisat, an, observation, satellite, that, orbits, the, earth, s, poles, on, march, 1, 2002, envisat, employs, advanced, synthetic, aperture, radar, asar, technology, which, can, detect, changes, in, surface, height, accurately, the, canadian, space, agency, launched, radarsat, 2, in, december, 2007, which, uses, sar, and, multi, polarization, modes, and, follows, the, same, orbit, path, as, radarsat, 1, iceberg, concentrations, and, size, distributions, are, monitored, worldwide, by, the, u, s, national, ice, center, nic, established, in, 1995, which, produces, analyses, and, forecasts, of, arctic, antarctic, great, lakes, and, chesapeake, bay, ice, conditions, more, than, 95, of, the, data, used, in, its, sea, ice, analyses, are, derived, from, the, remote, sensors, on, polar, orbiting, satellites, that, survey, these, remote, regions, of, the, earth, the, nic, is, the, only, organization, that, names, and, tracks, all, antarctic, icebergs, it, assigns, each, iceberg, larger, than, 10, nautical, miles, 19, km, along, at, least, one, axis, a, name, composed, of, a, letter, indicating, its, point, of, origin, and, a, running, number, the, letters, used, are, as, follows, the, danish, meteorological, institute, monitors, iceberg, populations, around, greenland, using, data, collected, by, the, synthetic, aperture, radar, sar, on, the, sentinel, 1, satellites, in, labrador, and, newfoundland, iceberg, management, plans, have, been, developed, to, protect, offshore, installations, from, impacts, with, icebergs, the, idea, of, towing, large, icebergs, to, other, regions, as, a, source, of, water, has, been, raised, since, at, least, the, 1950s, without, having, been, put, into, practice, in, 2017, a, business, from, the, uae, announced, plans, to, tow, an, iceberg, from, antarctica, to, the, middle, east, in, 2019, salvage, engineer, nick, sloane, announced, a, plan, to, move, one, to, south, africa, at, an, estimated, cost, of, 200, million, in, 2019, a, german, company, polewater, announced, plans, to, tow, antarctic, icebergs, to, places, like, south, africa, companies, have, used, iceberg, water, in, products, such, as, bottled, water, fizzy, ice, cubes, and, alcoholic, drinks, for, example, iceberg, beer, by, quidi, vidi, brewing, company, is, made, from, icebergs, found, around, st, john, s, newfoundland, although, annual, iceberg, supply, in, newfoundland, and, labrador, exceeds, the, total, freshwater, consumption, of, the, united, states, in, 2016, the, province, introduced, a, tax, on, iceberg, harvesting, and, imposed, a, limit, on, how, much, fresh, water, can, be, exported, yearly, the, freshwater, injected, into, the, ocean, by, melting, icebergs, can, change, the, density, of, the, seawater, in, the, vicinity, of, the, iceberg, fresh, melt, water, released, at, depth, is, lighter, and, therefore, more, buoyant, than, the, surrounding, seawater, causing, it, to, rise, towards, the, surface, icebergs, can, also, act, as, floating, breakwaters, impacting, ocean, waves, icebergs, contain, variable, concentrations, of, nutrients, and, minerals, that, are, released, into, the, ocean, during, melting, iceberg, derived, nutrients, particularly, the, iron, contained, in, sediments, can, fuel, blooms, of, phytoplankton, samples, collected, from, icebergs, in, antarctica, patagonia, greenland, svalbard, and, iceland, however, show, that, iron, concentrations, vary, significantly, complicating, efforts, to, generalize, the, impacts, of, icebergs, on, marine, ecosystems, iceberg, b15, calved, from, the, ross, ice, shelf, in, 2000, and, initially, had, an, area, of, 11, 000, square, kilometres, 4, 200, sq, mi, it, broke, apart, in, november, 2002, the, largest, remaining, piece, of, it, iceberg, b, 15a, with, an, area, of, 3, 000, square, kilometres, 1, 200, sq, mi, was, still, the, largest, iceberg, on, earth, until, it, ran, aground, and, split, into, several, pieces, october, 27, 2005, an, event, that, was, observed, by, seismographs, both, on, the, iceberg, and, across, antarctica, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, this, breakup, may, also, have, been, abetted, by, ocean, swell, generated, by, an, alaskan, storm, 6, days, earlier, and, 13, 500, kilometres, 8, 400, mi, away, one, of, the, most, infamous, icebergs, in, history, is, the, iceberg, that, sank, the, titanic, the, catastrophe, led, to, the, establishment, of, an, international, ice, patrol, shortly, after, icebergs, in, both, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, have, often, been, compared, in, size, to, multiples, of, the, 59, 1, square, kilometres, 22, 8, sq, mi, area, of, manhattan, island, artists, have, used, icebergs, as, the, subject, matter, for, their, paintings, frederic, edwin, church, the, icebergs, 1861, was, painted, from, sketches, church, completed, on, a, boat, trip, off, newfoundland, and, labrador, caspar, david, friedrich, the, sea, of, ice, 1823, 1824, is, polar, landscape, with, an, iceberg, and, ship, wreck, depicting, the, dangers, of, such, conditions, william, bradford, created, detailed, paintings, of, sailing, ships, set, in, arctic, coasts, and, was, fascinated, by, icebergs, albert, bierstadt, made, studies, on, arctic, trips, aboard, steamships, in, 1883, and, 1884, that, were, the, basis, of, his, paintings, of, arctic, scenes, with, colossal, icebergs, made, in, the, studio, american, poet, lydia, sigourney, wrote, the, poem, icebergs, while, on, a, return, journey, from, europe, in, 1841, her, steamship, encountered, a, field, of, icebergs, overnight, during, an, aurora, borealis, the, ship, made, it, through, unscathed, to, the, next, morning, when, the, sun, rose, and, touched, the, crowns, of, all, those, arctic, kings
