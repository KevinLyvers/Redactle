ore, is, natural, rock, or, sediment, that, contains, one, or, more, valuable, minerals, concentrated, above, background, levels, typically, containing, metals, that, can, be, mined, treated, and, sold, at, a, profit, the, grade, of, ore, refers, to, the, concentration, of, the, desired, material, it, contains, the, value, of, the, metals, or, minerals, a, rock, contains, must, be, weighed, against, the, cost, of, extraction, to, determine, whether, it, is, of, sufficiently, high, grade, to, be, worth, mining, and, is, therefore, considered, an, ore, a, complex, ore, is, one, containing, more, than, one, valuable, mineral, minerals, of, interest, are, generally, oxides, sulfides, silicates, or, native, metals, such, as, copper, or, gold, ore, bodies, are, formed, by, a, variety, of, geological, processes, generally, referred, to, as, ore, genesis, and, can, be, classified, based, on, their, deposit, type, ore, is, extracted, from, the, earth, through, mining, and, treated, or, refined, often, via, smelting, to, extract, the, valuable, metals, or, minerals, some, ores, depending, on, their, composition, may, pose, threats, to, health, or, surrounding, ecosystems, the, word, ore, is, of, anglo, saxon, origin, meaning, lump, of, metal, in, most, cases, an, ore, does, not, consist, entirely, of, a, single, mineral, but, it, is, mixed, with, other, valuable, minerals, and, with, unwanted, or, valueless, rocks, and, minerals, the, part, of, an, ore, that, is, not, economically, desirable, and, that, cannot, be, avoided, in, mining, is, known, as, gangue, the, valuable, ore, minerals, are, separated, from, the, gangue, minerals, by, froth, flotation, gravity, concentration, electric, or, magnetic, methods, and, other, operations, known, collectively, as, mineral, processing, or, ore, dressing, mineral, processing, consists, of, first, liberation, to, free, the, ore, from, the, gangue, and, concentration, to, separate, the, desired, mineral, s, from, it, once, processed, the, gangue, is, known, as, tailings, which, are, useless, but, potentially, harmful, materials, produced, in, great, quantity, especially, from, lower, grade, deposits, an, ore, deposit, is, an, economically, significant, accumulation, of, minerals, within, a, host, rock, this, is, distinct, from, a, mineral, resource, in, that, it, is, a, mineral, deposit, occurring, in, high, enough, concentration, to, be, economically, viable, an, ore, deposit, is, one, occurrence, of, a, particular, ore, type, most, ore, deposits, are, named, according, to, their, location, or, after, a, discoverer, e, g, the, kambalda, nickel, shoots, are, named, after, drillers, or, after, some, whimsy, a, historical, figure, a, prominent, person, a, city, or, town, from, which, the, owner, came, something, from, mythology, such, as, the, name, of, a, god, or, goddess, or, the, code, name, of, the, resource, company, which, found, it, e, g, mkd, 5, was, the, in, house, name, for, the, mount, keith, nickel, sulphide, deposit, ore, deposits, are, classified, according, to, various, criteria, developed, via, the, study, of, economic, geology, or, ore, genesis, the, following, is, a, general, categorization, of, the, main, ore, deposit, types, magmatic, deposits, are, ones, who, originate, directly, from, magma, these, are, ore, deposits, which, form, as, a, direct, result, of, metamorphism, these, are, the, leading, source, of, copper, ore, porphyry, copper, deposits, form, along, convergent, boundaries, and, are, thought, to, originate, from, the, partial, melting, of, subducted, oceanic, plates, and, subsequent, concentration, of, cu, driven, by, oxidation, these, are, large, round, disseminated, deposits, containing, on, average, 0, 8, copper, by, weight, hydrothermal, hydrothermal, deposits, are, a, large, source, of, ore, they, form, as, a, result, of, the, precipitation, of, dissolved, ore, constituents, out, of, fluids, laterites, form, from, the, weathering, of, highly, mafic, rock, near, the, equator, they, can, form, in, as, little, as, one, million, years, and, are, a, source, of, iron, fe, manganese, mn, and, aluminum, al, they, may, also, be, a, source, of, nickel, and, cobalt, when, the, parent, rock, is, enriched, in, these, elements, banded, iron, formations, bifs, are, the, highest, concentration, of, any, single, metal, available, they, are, composed, of, chert, beds, alternating, between, high, and, low, iron, concentrations, their, deposition, occurred, early, in, earth, s, history, when, the, atmospheric, composition, was, significantly, different, from, today, iron, rich, water, is, thought, to, have, upwelled, where, it, oxidized, to, fe, iii, in, the, presence, of, early, photosynthetic, plankton, producing, oxygen, this, iron, then, precipitated, out, and, deposited, on, the, ocean, floor, the, banding, is, thought, to, be, a, result, of, changing, plankton, population, sediment, hosted, copper, forms, from, the, precipitation, of, a, copper, rich, oxidized, brine, into, sedimentary, rocks, these, are, a, source, of, copper, primarily, in, the, form, of, copper, sulfide, minerals, placer, deposits, are, the, result, of, weathering, transport, and, subsequent, concentration, of, a, valuable, mineral, via, water, or, wind, they, are, typically, sources, of, gold, au, platinum, group, elements, pge, sulfide, minerals, tin, sn, tungsten, w, and, rare, earth, elements, rees, a, placer, deposit, is, considered, alluvial, if, formed, via, river, colluvial, if, by, gravity, and, eluvial, when, close, to, their, parent, rock, polymetallic, nodules, also, called, manganese, nodules, are, mineral, concretions, on, the, sea, floor, formed, of, concentric, layers, of, iron, and, manganese, hydroxides, around, a, core, they, are, formed, by, a, combination, of, diagenetic, and, sedimentary, precipitation, at, the, estimated, rate, of, about, a, centimeter, over, several, million, years, the, average, diameter, of, a, polymetallic, nodule, is, between, 3, and, 10, cm, 1, and, 4, in, in, diameter, and, are, characterized, by, enrichment, in, iron, manganese, heavy, metals, and, rare, earth, element, content, when, compared, to, the, earth, s, crust, and, surrounding, sediment, the, proposed, mining, of, these, nodules, via, remotely, operated, ocean, floor, trawling, robots, has, raised, a, number, of, ecological, concerns, the, extraction, of, ore, deposits, generally, follows, these, steps, progression, from, stages, 1, 3, will, see, a, continuous, disqualification, of, potential, ore, bodies, as, more, information, is, obtained, on, their, viability, with, rates, of, ore, discovery, in, a, steady, decline, since, the, mid, 20th, century, it, is, thought, that, most, surface, level, easily, accessible, sources, have, been, exhausted, this, means, progressively, lower, grade, deposits, must, be, turned, to, and, new, methods, of, extraction, must, be, developed, some, ores, contain, heavy, metals, toxins, radioactive, isotopes, and, other, potentially, negative, compounds, which, may, pose, a, risk, to, the, environment, or, health, the, exact, effects, an, ore, and, its, tailings, have, is, dependent, on, the, minerals, present, tailings, of, particular, concern, are, those, of, older, mines, as, containment, and, remediation, methods, in, the, past, were, next, to, non, existent, leading, to, high, levels, of, leaching, into, the, surrounding, environment, mercury, and, arsenic, are, two, ore, related, elements, of, particular, concern, additional, elements, found, in, ore, which, may, have, adverse, health, affects, in, organisms, include, iron, lead, uranium, zinc, silicon, titanium, sulfur, nitrogen, platinum, and, chromium, exposure, to, these, elements, may, result, in, respiratory, and, cardiovascular, problems, and, neurological, issues, these, are, of, particular, danger, to, aquatic, life, if, dissolved, in, water, ores, such, as, those, of, sulphide, minerals, may, severely, increase, the, acidity, of, their, immediate, surroundings, and, of, water, with, numerous, long, lasting, impacts, on, ecosystems, when, water, becomes, contaminated, it, may, transport, these, compounds, far, from, the, tailings, site, greatly, increasing, the, affected, range, uranium, ores, and, those, containing, other, radioactive, elements, may, pose, a, significant, threat, if, leaving, occurs, and, isotope, concentration, increases, above, background, levels, radiation, can, have, severe, long, lasting, environmental, impacts, and, cause, irreversible, damage, to, living, organisms, metallurgy, began, with, the, direct, working, of, native, metals, such, as, gold, lead, and, copper, placer, deposits, for, example, would, have, been, the, first, source, of, native, gold, the, first, exploited, ores, were, copper, oxides, such, as, malachite, and, azurite, over, 7000, years, ago, at, atalh, y, k, these, were, the, easiest, to, work, with, relatively, limited, mining, and, basic, requirements, for, smelting, it, is, believed, they, were, once, much, more, abundant, on, the, surface, than, today, after, this, copper, sulphides, would, have, been, turned, to, as, oxide, resources, depleted, and, the, bronze, age, progressed, lead, production, from, galena, smelting, may, have, been, occurring, at, this, time, as, well, the, smelting, of, arsenic, copper, sulphides, would, have, produced, the, first, bronze, alloys, the, majority, of, bronze, creation, however, required, tin, and, thus, the, exploitation, of, cassiterite, the, main, tin, source, began, some, 3000, years, ago, the, smelting, of, iron, ores, began, in, mesopotamia, iron, oxide, is, quite, abundant, on, the, surface, and, forms, from, a, variety, of, processes, until, the, 18th, century, gold, copper, lead, iron, silver, tin, arsenic, and, mercury, were, the, only, metals, mined, and, used, in, recent, decades, rare, earth, elements, have, been, increasingly, exploited, for, various, high, tech, applications, this, has, led, to, an, ever, growing, search, for, ree, ore, and, novel, ways, of, extracting, said, elements, ores, metals, are, traded, internationally, and, comprise, a, sizeable, portion, of, international, trade, in, raw, materials, both, in, value, and, volume, this, is, because, the, worldwide, distribution, of, ores, is, unequal, and, dislocated, from, locations, of, peak, demand, and, from, smelting, infrastructure, most, base, metals, copper, lead, zinc, nickel, are, traded, internationally, on, the, london, metal, exchange, with, smaller, stockpiles, and, metals, exchanges, monitored, by, the, comex, and, nymex, exchanges, in, the, united, states, and, the, shanghai, futures, exchange, in, china, the, global, chromium, market, is, currently, dominated, by, the, united, states, and, china, iron, ore, is, traded, between, customer, and, producer, though, various, benchmark, prices, are, set, quarterly, between, the, major, mining, conglomerates, and, the, major, consumers, and, this, sets, the, stage, for, smaller, participants, other, lesser, commodities, do, not, have, international, clearing, houses, and, benchmark, prices, with, most, prices, negotiated, between, suppliers, and, customers, one, on, one, this, generally, makes, determining, the, price, of, ores, of, this, nature, opaque, and, difficult, such, metals, include, lithium, niobium, tantalum, bismuth, antimony, and, rare, earths, most, of, these, commodities, are, also, dominated, by, one, or, two, major, suppliers, with, 60, of, the, world, s, reserves, china, is, currently, leading, in, world, production, of, rare, earth, elements, the, world, bank, reports, that, china, was, the, top, importer, of, ores, and, metals, in, 2005, followed, by, the, us, and, japan, for, detailed, petrographic, descriptions, of, ore, minerals, see, tables, for, the, determination, of, common, opaque, minerals, by, spry, and, gedlinske, 1987, below, are, the, major, economic, ore, minerals, and, their, deposits, grouped, by, primary, elements, media, related, to, ores, at, wikimedia, commons
