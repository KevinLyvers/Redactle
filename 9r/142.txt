cygnus, x, 1, abbreviated, cyg, x, 1, is, a, galactic, x, ray, source, in, the, constellation, cygnus, and, was, the, first, such, source, widely, accepted, to, be, a, black, hole, it, was, discovered, in, 1964, during, a, rocket, flight, and, is, one, of, the, strongest, x, ray, sources, detectable, from, earth, producing, a, peak, x, ray, flux, density, of, 2, 3, 10, 23, w, m, 2, hz, 2, 3, 10, 3, jansky, it, remains, among, the, most, studied, astronomical, objects, in, its, class, the, compact, object, is, now, estimated, to, have, a, mass, about, 21, 2, times, the, mass, of, the, sun, and, has, been, shown, to, be, too, small, to, be, any, known, kind, of, normal, star, or, other, likely, object, besides, a, black, hole, if, so, the, radius, of, its, event, horizon, has, 300, km, as, upper, bound, to, the, linear, dimension, of, the, source, region, of, occasional, x, ray, bursts, lasting, only, for, about, 1, ms, cygnus, x, 1, belongs, to, a, high, mass, x, ray, binary, system, located, about, 2, 22, kilo, parsecs, from, the, sun, that, includes, a, blue, supergiant, variable, star, designated, hde, 226868, which, it, orbits, at, about, 0, 2, au, or, 20, of, the, distance, from, earth, to, the, sun, a, stellar, wind, from, the, star, provides, material, for, an, accretion, disk, around, the, x, ray, source, matter, in, the, inner, disk, is, heated, to, millions, of, degrees, generating, the, observed, x, rays, a, pair, of, relativistic, jets, arranged, perpendicularly, to, the, disk, are, carrying, part, of, the, energy, of, the, infalling, material, away, into, interstellar, space, this, system, may, belong, to, a, stellar, association, called, cygnus, ob3, which, would, mean, that, cygnus, x, 1, is, about, 5, million, years, old, and, formed, from, a, progenitor, star, that, had, more, than, 40, solar, masses, the, majority, of, the, star, s, mass, was, shed, most, likely, as, a, stellar, wind, if, this, star, had, then, exploded, as, a, supernova, the, resulting, force, would, most, likely, have, ejected, the, remnant, from, the, system, hence, the, star, may, have, instead, collapsed, directly, into, a, black, hole, cygnus, x, 1, was, the, subject, of, a, friendly, scientific, wager, between, physicists, stephen, hawking, and, kip, thorne, in, 1975, with, hawking, betting, that, it, was, not, a, black, hole, hoping, to, lose, hawking, conceded, the, bet, in, 1990, after, observational, data, had, strengthened, the, case, that, there, was, indeed, a, black, hole, in, the, system, as, of, 2004, this, hypothesis, lacked, direct, empirical, evidence, but, was, generally, accepted, based, on, indirect, evidence, observation, of, x, ray, emissions, allows, astronomers, to, study, celestial, phenomena, involving, gas, with, temperatures, in, the, millions, of, degrees, however, because, x, ray, emissions, are, blocked, by, earth, s, atmosphere, observation, of, celestial, x, ray, sources, is, not, possible, without, lifting, instruments, to, altitudes, where, the, x, rays, can, penetrate, cygnus, x, 1, was, discovered, using, x, ray, instruments, that, were, carried, aloft, by, a, sounding, rocket, launched, from, white, sands, missile, range, in, new, mexico, as, part, of, an, ongoing, effort, to, map, these, sources, a, survey, was, conducted, in, 1964, using, two, aerobee, suborbital, rockets, the, rockets, carried, geiger, counters, to, measure, x, ray, emission, in, wavelength, range, 1, 15, across, an, 8, 4, section, of, the, sky, these, instruments, swept, across, the, sky, as, the, rockets, rotated, producing, a, map, of, closely, spaced, scans, as, a, result, of, these, surveys, eight, new, sources, of, cosmic, x, rays, were, discovered, including, cyg, xr, 1, later, cyg, x, 1, in, the, constellation, cygnus, the, celestial, coordinates, of, this, source, were, estimated, as, right, ascension, 19, h, 53, m, and, declination, 34, 6, it, was, not, associated, with, any, especially, prominent, radio, or, optical, source, at, that, position, seeing, a, need, for, longer, duration, studies, in, 1963, riccardo, giacconi, and, herb, gursky, proposed, the, first, orbital, satellite, to, study, x, ray, sources, nasa, launched, their, uhuru, satellite, in, 1970, which, led, to, the, discovery, of, 300, new, x, ray, sources, extended, uhuru, observations, of, cygnus, x, 1, showed, fluctuations, in, the, x, ray, intensity, that, occurs, several, times, a, second, this, rapid, variation, meant, that, the, x, ray, generation, must, occur, over, a, compact, region, no, larger, than, 10, 5, km, roughly, the, size, of, jupiter, as, the, speed, of, light, restricts, communication, between, more, distant, regions, in, april, may, 1971, luc, braes, and, george, k, miley, from, leiden, observatory, and, independently, robert, m, hjellming, and, campbell, wade, at, the, national, radio, astronomy, observatory, detected, radio, emission, from, cygnus, x, 1, and, their, accurate, radio, position, pinpointed, the, x, ray, source, to, the, star, agk2, 35, 1910, hde, 226868, on, the, celestial, sphere, this, star, lies, about, half, a, degree, from, the, 4th, magnitude, star, eta, cygni, it, is, a, supergiant, star, that, is, by, itself, incapable, of, emitting, the, observed, quantities, of, x, rays, hence, the, star, must, have, a, companion, that, could, heat, gas, to, the, millions, of, degrees, needed, to, produce, the, radiation, source, for, cygnus, x, 1, louise, webster, and, paul, murdin, at, the, royal, greenwich, observatory, and, charles, thomas, bolton, working, independently, at, the, university, of, toronto, s, david, dunlap, observatory, announced, the, discovery, of, a, massive, hidden, companion, to, hde, 226868, in, 1972, measurements, of, the, doppler, shift, of, the, star, s, spectrum, demonstrated, the, companion, s, presence, and, allowed, its, mass, to, be, estimated, from, the, orbital, parameters, based, on, the, high, predicted, mass, of, the, object, they, surmised, that, it, may, be, a, black, hole, as, the, largest, possible, neutron, star, cannot, exceed, three, times, the, mass, of, the, sun, with, further, observations, strengthening, the, evidence, by, the, end, of, 1973, the, astronomical, community, generally, conceded, that, cygnus, x, 1, was, most, likely, a, black, hole, more, precise, measurements, of, cygnus, x, 1, demonstrated, variability, down, to, a, single, millisecond, this, interval, is, consistent, with, turbulence, in, a, disk, of, accreted, matter, surrounding, a, black, hole, the, accretion, disk, x, ray, bursts, that, last, for, about, a, third, of, a, second, match, the, expected, time, frame, of, matter, falling, toward, a, black, hole, cygnus, x, 1, has, since, been, studied, extensively, using, observations, by, orbiting, and, ground, based, instruments, the, similarities, between, the, emissions, of, x, ray, binaries, such, as, hde, 226868, cygnus, x, 1, and, active, galactic, nuclei, suggests, a, common, mechanism, of, energy, generation, involving, a, black, hole, an, orbiting, accretion, disk, and, associated, jets, for, this, reason, cygnus, x, 1, is, identified, among, a, class, of, objects, called, microquasars, an, analog, of, the, quasars, or, quasi, stellar, radio, sources, now, known, to, be, distant, active, galactic, nuclei, scientific, studies, of, binary, systems, such, as, hde, 226868, cygnus, x, 1, may, lead, to, further, insights, into, the, mechanics, of, active, galaxies, the, compact, object, and, blue, supergiant, star, form, a, binary, system, in, which, they, orbit, around, their, center, of, mass, every, 5, 599829, days, from, the, perspective, of, earth, the, compact, object, never, goes, behind, the, other, star, in, other, words, the, system, does, not, eclipse, however, the, inclination, of, the, orbital, plane, to, the, line, of, sight, from, earth, remains, uncertain, with, predictions, ranging, from, 27, to, 65, a, 2007, study, estimated, the, inclination, as, 48, 0, 6, 8, which, would, mean, that, the, semi, major, axis, is, about, 0, 2, au, or, 20, of, the, distance, from, earth, to, the, sun, the, orbital, eccentricity, is, thought, to, be, only, 0, 018, 0, 002, meaning, a, nearly, circular, orbit, earth, s, distance, to, this, system, is, calculated, by, trigonometric, parallax, as, 1, 860, 120, parsecs, 6, 070, 390, light, years, and, by, radio, astrometry, as, 2, 220, 170, parsecs, 7, 240, 550, ly, the, hde, 226868, cygnus, x, 1, system, shares, a, common, motion, through, space, with, an, association, of, massive, stars, named, cygnus, ob3, which, is, located, at, roughly, 2000, parsecs, from, the, sun, this, implies, that, hde, 226868, cygnus, x, 1, and, this, ob, association, may, have, formed, at, the, same, time, and, location, if, so, then, the, age, of, the, system, is, about, 5, 1, 5, million, years, the, motion, of, hde, 226868, with, respect, to, cygnus, ob3, is, 9, 3, km, s, a, typical, value, for, random, motion, within, a, stellar, association, hde, 226868, is, about, 60, parsecs, from, the, center, of, the, association, and, could, have, reached, that, separation, in, about, 7, 2, million, years, which, roughly, agrees, with, estimated, age, of, the, association, with, a, galactic, latitude, of, 4, and, galactic, longitude, 71, this, system, lies, inward, along, the, same, orion, spur, in, which, the, sun, is, located, within, the, milky, way, near, where, the, spur, approaches, the, sagittarius, arm, cygnus, x, 1, has, been, described, as, belonging, to, the, sagittarius, arm, though, the, structure, of, the, milky, way, is, not, well, established, from, various, techniques, the, mass, of, the, compact, object, appears, to, be, greater, than, the, maximum, mass, for, a, neutron, star, stellar, evolutionary, models, suggest, a, mass, of, 20, 5, solar, masses, while, other, techniques, resulted, in, 10, solar, masses, measuring, periodicities, in, the, x, ray, emission, near, the, object, yielded, a, more, precise, value, of, 14, 8, 1, solar, masses, in, all, cases, the, object, is, most, likely, a, black, hole, a, region, of, space, with, a, gravitational, field, that, is, strong, enough, to, prevent, the, escape, of, electromagnetic, radiation, from, the, interior, the, boundary, of, this, region, is, called, the, event, horizon, and, has, an, effective, radius, called, the, schwarzschild, radius, which, is, about, 44, km, for, cygnus, x, 1, anything, including, matter, and, photons, that, passes, through, this, boundary, is, unable, to, escape, new, measurements, published, in, 2021, yielded, an, estimated, mass, of, 21, 2, 2, 2, solar, masses, evidence, of, just, such, an, event, horizon, may, have, been, detected, in, 1992, using, ultraviolet, uv, observations, with, the, high, speed, photometer, on, the, hubble, space, telescope, as, self, luminous, clumps, of, matter, spiral, into, a, black, hole, their, radiation, is, emitted, in, a, series, of, pulses, that, are, subject, to, gravitational, redshift, as, the, material, approaches, the, horizon, that, is, the, wavelengths, of, the, radiation, steadily, increase, as, predicted, by, general, relativity, matter, hitting, a, solid, compact, object, would, emit, a, final, burst, of, energy, whereas, material, passing, through, an, event, horizon, would, not, two, such, dying, pulse, trains, were, observed, which, is, consistent, with, the, existence, of, a, black, hole, the, spin, of, the, compact, object, is, not, yet, well, determined, past, analysis, of, data, from, the, space, based, chandra, x, ray, observatory, suggested, that, cygnus, x, 1, was, not, rotating, to, any, significant, degree, however, evidence, announced, in, 2011, suggests, that, it, is, rotating, extremely, rapidly, approximately, 790, times, per, second, the, largest, star, in, the, cygnus, ob3, association, has, a, mass, 40, times, that, of, the, sun, as, more, massive, stars, evolve, more, rapidly, this, implies, that, the, progenitor, star, for, cygnus, x, 1, had, more, than, 40, solar, masses, given, the, current, estimated, mass, of, the, black, hole, the, progenitor, star, must, have, lost, over, 30, solar, masses, of, material, part, of, this, mass, may, have, been, lost, to, hde, 226868, while, the, remainder, was, most, likely, expelled, by, a, strong, stellar, wind, the, helium, enrichment, of, hde, 226868, s, outer, atmosphere, may, be, evidence, for, this, mass, transfer, possibly, the, progenitor, may, have, evolved, into, a, wolf, rayet, star, which, ejects, a, substantial, proportion, of, its, atmosphere, using, just, such, a, powerful, stellar, wind, if, the, progenitor, star, had, exploded, as, a, supernova, then, observations, of, similar, objects, show, that, the, remnant, would, most, likely, have, been, ejected, from, the, system, at, a, relatively, high, velocity, as, the, object, remained, in, orbit, this, indicates, that, the, progenitor, may, have, collapsed, directly, into, a, black, hole, without, exploding, or, at, most, produced, only, a, relatively, modest, explosion, the, compact, object, is, thought, to, be, orbited, by, a, thin, flat, disk, of, accreting, matter, known, as, an, accretion, disk, this, disk, is, intensely, heated, by, friction, between, ionized, gas, in, faster, moving, inner, orbits, and, that, in, slower, outer, ones, it, is, divided, into, a, hot, inner, region, with, a, relatively, high, level, of, ionization, forming, a, plasma, and, a, cooler, less, ionized, outer, region, that, extends, to, an, estimated, 500, times, the, schwarzschild, radius, or, about, 15, 000, km, though, highly, and, erratically, variable, cygnus, x, 1, is, typically, the, brightest, persistent, source, of, hard, x, rays, those, with, energies, from, about, 30, up, to, several, hundred, kiloelectronvolts, in, the, sky, the, x, rays, are, produced, as, lower, energy, photons, in, the, thin, inner, accretion, disk, then, given, more, energy, through, compton, scattering, with, very, high, temperature, electrons, in, a, geometrically, thicker, but, nearly, transparent, corona, enveloping, it, as, well, as, by, some, further, reflection, from, the, surface, of, the, thin, disk, an, alternative, possibility, is, that, the, x, rays, may, be, compton, scattered, by, the, base, of, a, jet, instead, of, a, disk, corona, the, x, ray, emission, from, cygnus, x, 1, can, vary, in, a, somewhat, repetitive, pattern, called, quasi, periodic, oscillations, qpo, the, mass, of, the, compact, object, appears, to, determine, the, distance, at, which, the, surrounding, plasma, begins, to, emit, these, qpos, with, the, emission, radius, decreasing, as, the, mass, decreases, this, technique, has, been, used, to, estimate, the, mass, of, cygnus, x, 1, providing, a, cross, check, with, other, mass, derivations, pulsations, with, a, stable, period, similar, to, those, resulting, from, the, spin, of, a, neutron, star, have, never, been, seen, from, cygnus, x, 1, the, pulsations, from, neutron, stars, are, caused, by, the, neutron, star, s, rotating, magnetic, field, but, the, no, hair, theorem, guarantees, that, the, magnetic, field, of, a, black, hole, is, exactly, aligned, with, its, rotation, axis, and, thus, is, static, for, example, the, x, ray, binary, v, 0332, 53, was, thought, to, be, a, possible, black, hole, until, pulsations, were, found, cygnus, x, 1, has, also, never, displayed, x, ray, bursts, similar, to, those, seen, from, neutron, stars, cygnus, x, 1, unpredictably, changes, between, two, x, ray, states, although, the, x, rays, may, vary, continuously, between, those, states, as, well, in, the, most, common, state, the, x, rays, are, hard, which, means, that, more, of, the, x, rays, have, high, energy, in, the, less, common, state, the, x, rays, are, soft, with, more, of, the, x, rays, having, lower, energy, the, soft, state, also, shows, greater, variability, the, hard, state, is, believed, to, originate, in, a, corona, surrounding, the, inner, part, of, the, more, opaque, accretion, disk, the, soft, state, occurs, when, the, disk, draws, closer, to, the, compact, object, possibly, as, close, as, 150, km, accompanied, by, cooling, or, ejection, of, the, corona, when, a, new, corona, is, generated, cygnus, x, 1, transitions, back, to, the, hard, state, the, spectral, transition, of, cygnus, x, 1, can, be, explained, using, a, two, component, advective, flow, solution, as, proposed, by, chakrabarti, and, titarchuk, a, hard, state, is, generated, by, the, inverse, comptonisation, of, seed, photons, from, the, keplarian, disk, and, likewise, synchrotron, photons, produced, by, the, hot, electrons, in, the, centrifugal, pressure, supported, boundary, layer, cenbol, the, x, ray, flux, from, cygnus, x, 1, varies, periodically, every, 5, 6, days, especially, during, superior, conjunction, when, the, orbiting, objects, are, most, closely, aligned, with, earth, and, the, compact, source, is, the, more, distant, this, indicates, that, the, emissions, are, being, partially, blocked, by, circumstellar, matter, which, may, be, the, stellar, wind, from, the, star, hde, 226868, there, is, a, roughly, 300, day, periodicity, in, the, emission, which, could, be, caused, by, the, precession, of, the, accretion, disk, as, accreted, matter, falls, toward, the, compact, object, it, loses, gravitational, potential, energy, part, of, this, released, energy, is, dissipated, by, jets, of, particles, aligned, perpendicular, to, the, accretion, disk, that, flow, outward, with, relativistic, velocities, that, is, the, particles, are, moving, at, a, significant, fraction, of, the, speed, of, light, this, pair, of, jets, provide, a, means, for, an, accretion, disk, to, shed, excess, energy, and, angular, momentum, they, may, be, created, by, magnetic, fields, within, the, gas, that, surrounds, the, compact, object, the, cygnus, x, 1, jets, are, inefficient, radiators, and, so, release, only, a, small, proportion, of, their, energy, in, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, that, is, they, appear, dark, the, estimated, angle, of, the, jets, to, the, line, of, sight, is, 30, and, they, may, be, precessing, one, of, the, jets, is, colliding, with, a, relatively, dense, part, of, the, interstellar, medium, ism, forming, an, energized, ring, that, can, be, detected, by, its, radio, emission, this, collision, appears, to, be, forming, a, nebula, that, has, been, observed, in, the, optical, wavelengths, to, produce, this, nebula, the, jet, must, have, an, estimated, average, power, of, 4, 14, 10, 36, erg, s, or, 9, 5, 10, 29, w, this, is, more, than, 1, 000, times, the, power, emitted, by, the, sun, there, is, no, corresponding, ring, in, the, opposite, direction, because, that, jet, is, facing, a, lower, density, region, of, the, ism, in, 2006, cygnus, x, 1, became, the, first, stellar, mass, black, hole, found, to, display, evidence, of, gamma, ray, emission, in, the, very, high, energy, band, above, 100, gev, the, signal, was, observed, at, the, same, time, as, a, flare, of, hard, x, rays, suggesting, a, link, between, the, events, the, x, ray, flare, may, have, been, produced, at, the, base, of, the, jet, while, the, gamma, rays, could, have, been, generated, where, the, jet, interacts, with, the, stellar, wind, of, hde, 226868, hde, 226868, is, a, supergiant, star, with, a, spectral, class, of, o9, 7, iab, which, is, on, the, borderline, between, class, o, and, class, b, stars, it, has, an, estimated, surface, temperature, of, 31, 000, k, and, mass, approximately, 20, 40, times, the, mass, of, the, sun, based, on, a, stellar, evolutionary, model, at, the, estimated, distance, of, 2, 000, parsecs, this, star, may, have, a, radius, equal, to, about, 15, 17, times, the, solar, radius, and, has, approximately, 300, 000, 400, 000, times, the, luminosity, of, the, sun, for, comparison, the, compact, object, is, estimated, to, be, orbiting, hde, 226868, at, a, distance, of, about, 40, solar, radii, or, twice, the, radius, of, this, star, the, surface, of, hde, 226868, is, being, tidally, distorted, by, the, gravity, of, the, massive, companion, forming, a, tear, drop, shape, that, is, further, distorted, by, rotation, this, causes, the, optical, brightness, of, the, star, to, vary, by, 0, 06, magnitudes, during, each, 5, 6, day, binary, orbit, with, the, minimum, magnitude, occurring, when, the, system, is, aligned, with, the, line, of, sight, the, ellipsoidal, pattern, of, light, variation, results, from, the, limb, darkening, and, gravity, darkening, of, the, star, s, surface, when, the, spectrum, of, hde, 226868, is, compared, to, the, similar, star, alnilam, the, former, shows, an, overabundance, of, helium, and, an, underabundance, of, carbon, in, its, atmosphere, the, ultraviolet, and, hydrogen, alpha, spectral, lines, of, hde, 226868, show, profiles, similar, to, the, star, p, cygni, which, indicates, that, the, star, is, surrounded, by, a, gaseous, envelope, that, is, being, accelerated, away, from, the, star, at, speeds, of, about, 1, 500, km, s, like, other, stars, of, its, spectral, type, hde, 226868, is, thought, to, be, shedding, mass, in, a, stellar, wind, at, an, estimated, rate, of, 2, 5, 10, 6, solar, masses, per, year, or, one, solar, mass, every, 400, 000, years, the, gravitational, influence, of, the, compact, object, appears, to, be, reshaping, this, stellar, wind, producing, a, focused, wind, geometry, rather, than, a, spherically, symmetrical, wind, x, rays, from, the, region, surrounding, the, compact, object, heat, and, ionize, this, stellar, wind, as, the, object, moves, through, different, regions, of, the, stellar, wind, during, its, 5, 6, day, orbit, the, uv, lines, the, radio, emission, and, the, x, rays, themselves, all, vary, the, roche, lobe, of, hde, 226868, defines, the, region, of, space, around, the, star, where, orbiting, material, remains, gravitationally, bound, material, that, passes, beyond, this, lobe, may, fall, toward, the, orbiting, companion, this, roche, lobe, is, believed, to, be, close, to, the, surface, of, hde, 226868, but, not, overflowing, so, the, material, at, the, stellar, surface, is, not, being, stripped, away, by, its, companion, however, a, significant, proportion, of, the, stellar, wind, emitted, by, the, star, is, being, drawn, onto, the, compact, object, s, accretion, disk, after, passing, beyond, this, lobe, the, gas, and, dust, between, the, sun, and, hde, 226868, results, in, a, reduction, in, the, apparent, magnitude, of, the, star, as, well, as, a, reddening, of, the, hue, red, light, can, more, effectively, penetrate, the, dust, in, the, interstellar, medium, the, estimated, value, of, the, interstellar, extinction, a, v, is, 3, 3, magnitudes, without, the, intervening, matter, hde, 226868, would, be, a, fifth, magnitude, star, and, thus, visible, to, the, unaided, eye, cygnus, x, 1, was, the, subject, of, a, bet, between, physicists, stephen, hawking, and, kip, thorne, in, which, hawking, bet, against, the, existence, of, black, holes, in, the, region, hawking, later, described, this, as, an, insurance, policy, of, sorts, in, his, book, a, brief, history, of, time, he, wrote, this, was, a, form, of, insurance, policy, for, me, i, have, done, a, lot, of, work, on, black, holes, and, it, would, all, be, wasted, if, it, turned, out, that, black,
