stellar, structure, models, describe, the, internal, structure, of, a, star, in, detail, and, make, predictions, about, the, luminosity, the, color, and, the, future, evolution, of, the, star, different, classes, and, ages, of, stars, have, different, internal, structures, reflecting, their, elemental, makeup, and, energy, transport, mechanisms, for, energy, transport, refer, to, radiative, transfer, different, layers, of, the, stars, transport, heat, up, and, outwards, in, different, ways, primarily, convection, and, radiative, transfer, but, thermal, conduction, is, important, in, white, dwarfs, convection, is, the, dominant, mode, of, energy, transport, when, the, temperature, gradient, is, steep, enough, so, that, a, given, parcel, of, gas, within, the, star, will, continue, to, rise, if, it, rises, slightly, via, an, adiabatic, process, in, this, case, the, rising, parcel, is, buoyant, and, continues, to, rise, if, it, is, warmer, than, the, surrounding, gas, if, the, rising, parcel, is, cooler, than, the, surrounding, gas, it, will, fall, back, to, its, original, height, in, regions, with, a, low, temperature, gradient, and, a, low, enough, opacity, to, allow, energy, transport, via, radiation, radiation, is, the, dominant, mode, of, energy, transport, the, internal, structure, of, a, main, sequence, star, depends, upon, the, mass, of, the, star, in, stars, with, masses, of, 0, 3, 1, 5, solar, masses, m, including, the, sun, hydrogen, to, helium, fusion, occurs, primarily, via, proton, proton, chains, which, do, not, establish, a, steep, temperature, gradient, thus, radiation, dominates, in, the, inner, portion, of, solar, mass, stars, the, outer, portion, of, solar, mass, stars, is, cool, enough, that, hydrogen, is, neutral, and, thus, opaque, to, ultraviolet, photons, so, convection, dominates, therefore, solar, mass, stars, have, radiative, cores, with, convective, envelopes, in, the, outer, portion, of, the, star, in, massive, stars, greater, than, about, 1, 5, m, the, core, temperature, is, above, about, 1, 8, 10, 7, k, so, hydrogen, to, helium, fusion, occurs, primarily, via, the, cno, cycle, in, the, cno, cycle, the, energy, generation, rate, scales, as, the, temperature, to, the, 15th, power, whereas, the, rate, scales, as, the, temperature, to, the, 4th, power, in, the, proton, proton, chains, due, to, the, strong, temperature, sensitivity, of, the, cno, cycle, the, temperature, gradient, in, the, inner, portion, of, the, star, is, steep, enough, to, make, the, core, convective, in, the, outer, portion, of, the, star, the, temperature, gradient, is, shallower, but, the, temperature, is, high, enough, that, the, hydrogen, is, nearly, fully, ionized, so, the, star, remains, transparent, to, ultraviolet, radiation, thus, massive, stars, have, a, radiative, envelope, the, lowest, mass, main, sequence, stars, have, no, radiation, zone, the, dominant, energy, transport, mechanism, throughout, the, star, is, convection, the, simplest, commonly, used, model, of, stellar, structure, is, the, spherically, symmetric, quasi, static, model, which, assumes, that, a, star, is, in, a, steady, state, and, that, it, is, spherically, symmetric, it, contains, four, basic, first, order, differential, equations, two, represent, how, matter, and, pressure, vary, with, radius, two, represent, how, temperature, and, luminosity, vary, with, radius, in, forming, the, stellar, structure, equations, exploiting, the, assumed, spherical, symmetry, one, considers, the, matter, density, r, displaystyle, rho, r, temperature, t, r, displaystyle, t, r, total, pressure, matter, plus, radiation, p, r, displaystyle, p, r, luminosity, l, r, displaystyle, l, r, and, energy, generation, rate, per, unit, mass, r, displaystyle, epsilon, r, in, a, spherical, shell, of, a, thickness, d, r, displaystyle, mbox, d, r, at, a, distance, r, displaystyle, r, from, the, center, of, the, star, the, star, is, assumed, to, be, in, local, thermodynamic, equilibrium, lte, so, the, temperature, is, identical, for, matter, and, photons, although, lte, does, not, strictly, hold, because, the, temperature, a, given, shell, sees, below, itself, is, always, hotter, than, the, temperature, above, this, approximation, is, normally, excellent, because, the, photon, mean, free, path, displaystyle, lambda, is, much, smaller, than, the, length, over, which, the, temperature, varies, considerably, i, e, t, t, displaystyle, lambda, ll, t, nabla, t, first, is, a, statement, of, hydrostatic, equilibrium, the, outward, force, due, to, the, pressure, gradient, within, the, star, is, exactly, balanced, by, the, inward, force, due, to, gravity, this, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, stellar, equilibrium, where, m, r, displaystyle, m, r, is, the, cumulative, mass, inside, the, shell, at, r, displaystyle, r, and, g, is, the, gravitational, constant, the, cumulative, mass, increases, with, radius, according, to, the, mass, continuity, equation, integrating, the, mass, continuity, equation, from, the, star, center, r, 0, displaystyle, r, 0, to, the, radius, of, the, star, r, r, displaystyle, r, r, yields, the, total, mass, of, the, star, considering, the, energy, leaving, the, spherical, shell, yields, the, energy, equation, where, displaystyle, epsilon, nu, is, the, luminosity, produced, in, the, form, of, neutrinos, which, usually, escape, the, star, without, interacting, with, ordinary, matter, per, unit, mass, outside, the, core, of, the, star, where, nuclear, reactions, occur, no, energy, is, generated, so, the, luminosity, is, constant, the, energy, transport, equation, takes, differing, forms, depending, upon, the, mode, of, energy, transport, for, conductive, energy, transport, appropriate, for, a, white, dwarf, the, energy, equation, is, where, k, is, the, thermal, conductivity, in, the, case, of, radiative, energy, transport, appropriate, for, the, inner, portion, of, a, solar, mass, main, sequence, star, and, the, outer, envelope, of, a, massive, main, sequence, star, where, displaystyle, kappa, is, the, opacity, of, the, matter, displaystyle, sigma, is, the, stefan, boltzmann, constant, and, the, boltzmann, constant, is, set, to, one, the, case, of, convective, energy, transport, does, not, have, a, known, rigorous, mathematical, formulation, and, involves, turbulence, in, the, gas, convective, energy, transport, is, usually, modeled, using, mixing, length, theory, this, treats, the, gas, in, the, star, as, containing, discrete, elements, which, roughly, retain, the, temperature, density, and, pressure, of, their, surroundings, but, move, through, the, star, as, far, as, a, characteristic, length, called, the, mixing, length, for, a, monatomic, ideal, gas, when, the, convection, is, adiabatic, meaning, that, the, convective, gas, bubbles, don, t, exchange, heat, with, their, surroundings, mixing, length, theory, yields, where, c, p, c, v, displaystyle, gamma, c, p, c, v, is, the, adiabatic, index, the, ratio, of, specific, heats, in, the, gas, for, a, fully, ionized, ideal, gas, 5, 3, displaystyle, gamma, 5, 3, when, the, convection, is, not, adiabatic, the, true, temperature, gradient, is, not, given, by, this, equation, for, example, in, the, sun, the, convection, at, the, base, of, the, convection, zone, near, the, core, is, adiabatic, but, that, near, the, surface, is, not, the, mixing, length, theory, contains, two, free, parameters, which, must, be, set, to, make, the, model, fit, observations, so, it, is, a, phenomenological, theory, rather, than, a, rigorous, mathematical, formulation, also, required, are, the, equations, of, state, relating, the, pressure, opacity, and, energy, generation, rate, to, other, local, variables, appropriate, for, the, material, such, as, temperature, density, chemical, composition, etc, relevant, equations, of, state, for, pressure, may, have, to, include, the, perfect, gas, law, radiation, pressure, pressure, due, to, degenerate, electrons, etc, opacity, cannot, be, expressed, exactly, by, a, single, formula, it, is, calculated, for, various, compositions, at, specific, densities, and, temperatures, and, presented, in, tabular, form, stellar, structure, codes, meaning, computer, programs, calculating, the, model, s, variables, either, interpolate, in, a, density, temperature, grid, to, obtain, the, opacity, needed, or, use, a, fitting, function, based, on, the, tabulated, values, a, similar, situation, occurs, for, accurate, calculations, of, the, pressure, equation, of, state, finally, the, nuclear, energy, generation, rate, is, computed, from, nuclear, physics, experiments, using, reaction, networks, to, compute, reaction, rates, for, each, individual, reaction, step, and, equilibrium, abundances, for, each, isotope, in, the, gas, combined, with, a, set, of, boundary, conditions, a, solution, of, these, equations, completely, describes, the, behavior, of, the, star, typical, boundary, conditions, set, the, values, of, the, observable, parameters, appropriately, at, the, surface, r, r, displaystyle, r, r, and, center, r, 0, displaystyle, r, 0, of, the, star, p, r, 0, displaystyle, p, r, 0, meaning, the, pressure, at, the, surface, of, the, star, is, zero, m, 0, 0, displaystyle, m, 0, 0, there, is, no, mass, inside, the, center, of, the, star, as, required, if, the, mass, density, remains, finite, m, r, m, displaystyle, m, r, m, the, total, mass, of, the, star, is, the, star, s, mass, and, t, r, t, e, f, f, displaystyle, t, r, t, eff, the, temperature, at, the, surface, is, the, effective, temperature, of, the, star, although, nowadays, stellar, evolution, models, describe, the, main, features, of, color, magnitude, diagrams, important, improvements, have, to, be, made, in, order, to, remove, uncertainties, which, are, linked, to, the, limited, knowledge, of, transport, phenomena, the, most, difficult, challenge, remains, the, numerical, treatment, of, turbulence, some, research, teams, are, developing, simplified, modelling, of, turbulence, in, 3d, calculations, the, above, simplified, model, is, not, adequate, without, modification, in, situations, when, the, composition, changes, are, sufficiently, rapid, the, equation, of, hydrostatic, equilibrium, may, need, to, be, modified, by, adding, a, radial, acceleration, term, if, the, radius, of, the, star, is, changing, very, quickly, for, example, if, the, star, is, radially, pulsating, also, if, the, nuclear, burning, is, not, stable, or, the, star, s, core, is, rapidly, collapsing, an, entropy, term, must, be, added, to, the, energy, equation
