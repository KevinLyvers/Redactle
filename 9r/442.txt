berkelium, is, a, synthetic, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, bk, and, atomic, number, 97, it, is, a, member, of, the, actinide, and, transuranium, element, series, it, is, named, after, the, city, of, berkeley, california, the, location, of, the, lawrence, berkeley, national, laboratory, then, the, university, of, california, radiation, laboratory, where, it, was, discovered, in, december, 1949, berkelium, was, the, fifth, transuranium, element, discovered, after, neptunium, plutonium, curium, and, americium, the, major, isotope, of, berkelium, 249, bk, is, synthesized, in, minute, quantities, in, dedicated, high, flux, nuclear, reactors, mainly, at, the, oak, ridge, national, laboratory, in, tennessee, united, states, and, at, the, research, institute, of, atomic, reactors, in, dimitrovgrad, russia, the, longest, lived, and, second, most, important, isotope, 247, bk, can, be, synthesized, via, irradiation, of, 244, cm, with, high, energy, alpha, particles, just, over, one, gram, of, berkelium, has, been, produced, in, the, united, states, since, 1967, there, is, no, practical, application, of, berkelium, outside, scientific, research, which, is, mostly, directed, at, the, synthesis, of, heavier, transuranium, elements, and, superheavy, elements, a, 22, milligram, batch, of, berkelium, 249, was, prepared, during, a, 250, day, irradiation, period, and, then, purified, for, a, further, 90, days, at, oak, ridge, in, 2009, this, sample, was, used, to, synthesize, the, new, element, tennessine, for, the, first, time, in, 2009, at, the, joint, institute, for, nuclear, research, russia, after, it, was, bombarded, with, calcium, 48, ions, for, 150, days, this, was, the, culmination, of, the, russia, us, collaboration, on, the, synthesis, of, the, heaviest, elements, on, the, periodic, table, berkelium, is, a, soft, silvery, white, radioactive, metal, the, berkelium, 249, isotope, emits, low, energy, electrons, and, thus, is, relatively, safe, to, handle, it, decays, with, a, half, life, of, 330, days, to, californium, 249, which, is, a, strong, emitter, of, ionizing, alpha, particles, this, gradual, transformation, is, an, important, consideration, when, studying, the, properties, of, elemental, berkelium, and, its, chemical, compounds, since, the, formation, of, californium, brings, not, only, chemical, contamination, but, also, free, radical, effects, and, self, heating, from, the, emitted, alpha, particles, berkelium, is, a, soft, silvery, white, radioactive, actinide, metal, in, the, periodic, table, it, is, located, to, the, right, of, the, actinide, curium, to, the, left, of, the, actinide, californium, and, below, the, lanthanide, terbium, with, which, it, shares, many, similarities, in, physical, and, chemical, properties, its, density, of, 14, 78, g, cm, 3, lies, between, those, of, curium, 13, 52, g, cm, 3, and, californium, 15, 1, g, cm, 3, as, does, its, melting, point, of, 986, c, below, that, of, curium, 1340, c, but, higher, than, that, of, californium, 900, c, berkelium, is, relatively, soft, and, has, one, of, the, lowest, bulk, moduli, among, the, actinides, at, about, 20, gpa, 2, 10, 10, pa, berkelium, iii, ions, shows, two, sharp, fluorescence, peaks, at, 652, nanometers, red, light, and, 742, nanometers, deep, red, near, infrared, due, to, internal, transitions, at, the, f, electron, shell, the, relative, intensity, of, these, peaks, depends, on, the, excitation, power, and, temperature, of, the, sample, this, emission, can, be, observed, for, example, after, dispersing, berkelium, ions, in, a, silicate, glass, by, melting, the, glass, in, presence, of, berkelium, oxide, or, halide, between, 70, k, and, room, temperature, berkelium, behaves, as, a, curie, weiss, paramagnetic, material, with, an, effective, magnetic, moment, of, 9, 69, bohr, magnetons, b, and, a, curie, temperature, of, 101, k, this, magnetic, moment, is, almost, equal, to, the, theoretical, value, of, 9, 72, b, calculated, within, the, simple, atomic, l, s, coupling, model, upon, cooling, to, about, 34, k, berkelium, undergoes, a, transition, to, an, antiferromagnetic, state, the, enthalpy, of, dissolution, in, hydrochloric, acid, at, standard, conditions, is, 600, kj, mol, from, which, the, standard, enthalpy, of, formation, f, h, of, aqueous, bk, 3, ions, is, obtained, as, 601, kj, mol, the, standard, electrode, potential, bk, 3, bk, is, 2, 01, v, the, ionization, potential, of, a, neutral, berkelium, atom, is, 6, 23, ev, at, ambient, conditions, berkelium, assumes, its, most, stable, form, which, has, a, hexagonal, symmetry, space, group, p6, 3, mmc, lattice, parameters, of, 341, pm, and, 1107, pm, the, crystal, has, a, double, hexagonal, close, packing, structure, with, the, layer, sequence, abac, and, so, is, isotypic, having, a, similar, structure, with, lanthanum, and, forms, of, actinides, beyond, curium, this, crystal, structure, changes, with, pressure, and, temperature, when, compressed, at, room, temperature, to, 7, gpa, berkelium, transforms, to, the, modification, which, has, a, face, centered, cubic, fcc, symmetry, and, space, group, fm, 3, m, this, transition, occurs, without, change, in, volume, but, the, enthalpy, increases, by, 3, 66, kj, mol, upon, further, compression, to, 25, gpa, berkelium, transforms, to, an, orthorhombic, berkelium, structure, similar, to, that, of, uranium, this, transition, is, accompanied, by, a, 12, volume, decrease, and, delocalization, of, the, electrons, at, the, 5f, electron, shell, no, further, phase, transitions, are, observed, up, to, 57, gpa, upon, heating, berkelium, transforms, into, another, phase, with, an, fcc, lattice, but, slightly, different, from, berkelium, space, group, fm, 3, m, and, the, lattice, constant, of, 500, pm, this, fcc, structure, is, equivalent, to, the, closest, packing, with, the, sequence, abc, this, phase, is, metastable, and, will, gradually, revert, to, the, original, berkelium, phase, at, room, temperature, the, temperature, of, the, phase, transition, is, believed, to, be, quite, close, to, the, melting, point, like, all, actinides, berkelium, dissolves, in, various, aqueous, inorganic, acids, liberating, gaseous, hydrogen, and, converting, into, the, berkelium, iii, state, this, trivalent, oxidation, state, 3, is, the, most, stable, especially, in, aqueous, solutions, but, tetravalent, 4, pentavalent, 5, and, possibly, divalent, 2, berkelium, compounds, are, also, known, the, existence, of, divalent, berkelium, salts, is, uncertain, and, has, only, been, reported, in, mixed, lanthanum, iii, chloride, strontium, chloride, melts, a, similar, behavior, is, observed, for, the, lanthanide, analogue, of, berkelium, terbium, aqueous, solutions, of, bk, 3, ions, are, green, in, most, acids, the, color, of, bk, 4, ions, is, yellow, in, hydrochloric, acid, and, orange, yellow, in, sulfuric, acid, berkelium, does, not, react, rapidly, with, oxygen, at, room, temperature, possibly, due, to, the, formation, of, a, protective, oxide, layer, surface, however, it, reacts, with, molten, metals, hydrogen, halogens, chalcogens, and, pnictogens, to, form, various, binary, compounds, nineteen, isotopes, and, six, nuclear, isomers, excited, states, of, an, isotope, of, berkelium, have, been, characterized, with, mass, numbers, ranging, from, 233, to, 253, except, 235, and, 237, all, of, them, are, radioactive, the, longest, half, lives, are, observed, for, 247, bk, 1, 380, years, 248, bk, over, 300, years, and, 249, bk, 330, days, the, half, lives, of, the, other, isotopes, range, from, microseconds, to, several, days, the, isotope, which, is, the, easiest, to, synthesize, is, berkelium, 249, this, emits, mostly, soft, particles, which, are, inconvenient, for, detection, its, alpha, radiation, is, rather, weak, 1, 45, 10, 3, with, respect, to, the, radiation, but, is, sometimes, used, to, detect, this, isotope, the, second, important, berkelium, isotope, berkelium, 247, is, an, alpha, emitter, as, are, most, actinide, isotopes, all, berkelium, isotopes, have, a, half, life, far, too, short, to, be, primordial, therefore, any, primordial, berkelium, that, is, berkelium, present, on, the, earth, during, its, formation, has, decayed, by, now, on, earth, berkelium, is, mostly, concentrated, in, certain, areas, which, were, used, for, the, atmospheric, nuclear, weapons, tests, between, 1945, and, 1980, as, well, as, at, the, sites, of, nuclear, incidents, such, as, the, chernobyl, disaster, three, mile, island, accident, and, 1968, thule, air, base, b, 52, crash, analysis, of, the, debris, at, the, testing, site, of, the, first, united, states, first, thermonuclear, weapon, ivy, mike, 1, november, 1952, enewetak, atoll, revealed, high, concentrations, of, various, actinides, including, berkelium, for, reasons, of, military, secrecy, this, result, was, not, published, until, 1956, nuclear, reactors, produce, mostly, among, the, berkelium, isotopes, berkelium, 249, during, the, storage, and, before, the, fuel, disposal, most, of, it, beta, decays, to, californium, 249, the, latter, has, a, half, life, of, 351, years, which, is, relatively, long, compared, to, the, half, lives, of, other, isotopes, produced, in, the, reactor, and, is, therefore, undesirable, in, the, disposal, products, the, transuranium, elements, from, americium, to, fermium, including, berkelium, occurred, naturally, in, the, natural, nuclear, fission, reactor, at, oklo, but, no, longer, do, so, berkelium, is, also, one, of, the, elements, that, have, theoretically, been, detected, in, przybylski, s, star, although, very, small, amounts, of, berkelium, were, possibly, produced, in, previous, nuclear, experiments, it, was, first, intentionally, synthesized, isolated, and, identified, in, december, 1949, by, glenn, t, seaborg, albert, ghiorso, stanley, gerald, thompson, and, kenneth, street, jr, they, used, the, 60, inch, cyclotron, at, the, university, of, california, berkeley, similar, to, the, nearly, simultaneous, discovery, of, americium, element, 95, and, curium, element, 96, in, 1944, the, new, elements, berkelium, and, californium, element, 98, were, both, produced, in, 1949, 1950, the, name, choice, for, element, 97, followed, the, previous, tradition, of, the, californian, group, to, draw, an, analogy, between, the, newly, discovered, actinide, and, the, lanthanide, element, positioned, above, it, in, the, periodic, table, previously, americium, was, named, after, a, continent, as, its, analogue, europium, and, curium, honored, scientists, marie, and, pierre, curie, as, the, lanthanide, above, it, gadolinium, was, named, after, the, explorer, of, the, rare, earth, elements, johan, gadolin, thus, the, discovery, report, by, the, berkeley, group, reads, it, is, suggested, that, element, 97, be, given, the, name, berkelium, symbol, bk, after, the, city, of, berkeley, in, a, manner, similar, to, that, used, in, naming, its, chemical, homologue, terbium, atomic, number, 65, whose, name, was, derived, from, the, town, of, ytterby, sweden, where, the, rare, earth, minerals, were, first, found, this, tradition, ended, with, berkelium, though, as, the, naming, of, the, next, discovered, actinide, californium, was, not, related, to, its, lanthanide, analogue, dysprosium, but, after, the, discovery, place, the, most, difficult, steps, in, the, synthesis, of, berkelium, were, its, separation, from, the, final, products, and, the, production, of, sufficient, quantities, of, americium, for, the, target, material, first, americium, 241, am, nitrate, solution, was, coated, on, a, platinum, foil, the, solution, was, evaporated, and, the, residue, converted, by, annealing, to, americium, dioxide, amo, 2, this, target, was, irradiated, with, 35, mev, alpha, particles, for, 6, hours, in, the, 60, inch, cyclotron, at, the, lawrence, radiation, laboratory, university, of, california, berkeley, the, 2n, reaction, induced, by, the, irradiation, yielded, the, 243, bk, isotope, and, two, free, neutrons, after, the, irradiation, the, coating, was, dissolved, with, nitric, acid, and, then, precipitated, as, the, hydroxide, using, concentrated, aqueous, ammonia, solution, the, product, was, centrifugated, and, re, dissolved, in, nitric, acid, to, separate, berkelium, from, the, unreacted, americium, this, solution, was, added, to, a, mixture, of, ammonium, and, ammonium, sulfate, and, heated, to, convert, all, the, dissolved, americium, into, the, oxidation, state, 6, unoxidized, residual, americium, was, precipitated, by, the, addition, of, hydrofluoric, acid, as, americium, iii, fluoride, amf, 3, this, step, yielded, a, mixture, of, the, accompanying, product, curium, and, the, expected, element, 97, in, form, of, trifluorides, the, mixture, was, converted, to, the, corresponding, hydroxides, by, treating, it, with, potassium, hydroxide, and, after, centrifugation, was, dissolved, in, perchloric, acid, further, separation, was, carried, out, in, the, presence, of, a, citric, acid, ammonium, buffer, solution, in, a, weakly, acidic, medium, ph, 3, 5, using, ion, exchange, at, elevated, temperature, the, chromatographic, separation, behavior, was, unknown, for, the, element, 97, at, the, time, but, was, anticipated, by, analogy, with, terbium, the, first, results, were, disappointing, because, no, alpha, particle, emission, signature, could, be, detected, from, the, elution, product, with, further, analysis, searching, for, characteristic, x, rays, and, conversion, electron, signals, a, berkelium, isotope, was, eventually, detected, its, mass, number, was, uncertain, between, 243, and, 244, in, the, initial, report, but, was, later, established, as, 243, berkelium, is, produced, by, bombarding, lighter, actinides, uranium, 238, u, or, plutonium, 239, pu, with, neutrons, in, a, nuclear, reactor, in, a, more, common, case, of, uranium, fuel, plutonium, is, produced, first, by, neutron, capture, the, so, called, n, reaction, or, neutron, fusion, followed, by, beta, decay, plutonium, 239, is, further, irradiated, by, a, source, that, has, a, high, neutron, flux, several, times, higher, than, a, conventional, nuclear, reactor, such, as, the, 85, megawatt, high, flux, isotope, reactor, hfir, at, the, oak, ridge, national, laboratory, in, tennessee, us, the, higher, flux, promotes, fusion, reactions, involving, not, one, but, several, neutrons, converting, 239, pu, to, 244, cm, and, then, to, 249, cm, curium, 249, has, a, short, half, life, of, 64, minutes, and, thus, its, further, conversion, to, 250, cm, has, a, low, probability, instead, it, transforms, by, beta, decay, into, 249, bk, the, thus, produced, 249, bk, has, a, long, half, life, of, 330, days, and, thus, can, capture, another, neutron, however, the, product, 250, bk, again, has, a, relatively, short, half, life, of, 3, 212, hours, and, thus, does, not, yield, any, heavier, berkelium, isotopes, it, instead, decays, to, the, californium, isotope, 250, cf, although, 247, bk, is, the, most, stable, isotope, of, berkelium, its, production, in, nuclear, reactors, is, very, difficult, because, its, potential, progenitor, 247, cm, has, never, been, observed, to, undergo, beta, decay, thus, 249, bk, is, the, most, accessible, isotope, of, berkelium, which, still, is, available, only, in, small, quantities, only, 0, 66, grams, have, been, produced, in, the, us, over, the, period, 1967, 1983, at, a, high, price, of, the, order, 185, usd, per, microgram, it, is, the, only, berkelium, isotope, available, in, bulk, quantities, and, thus, the, only, berkelium, isotope, whose, properties, can, be, extensively, studied, the, isotope, 248, bk, was, first, obtained, in, 1956, by, bombarding, a, mixture, of, curium, isotopes, with, 25, mev, particles, although, its, direct, detection, was, hindered, by, strong, signal, interference, with, 245, bk, the, existence, of, a, new, isotope, was, proven, by, the, growth, of, the, decay, product, 248, cf, which, had, been, previously, characterized, the, half, life, of, 248, bk, was, estimated, as, 23, 5, hours, though, later, 1965, work, gave, a, half, life, in, excess, of, 300, years, which, may, be, due, to, an, isomeric, state, berkelium, 247, was, produced, during, the, same, year, by, irradiating, 244, cm, with, alpha, particles, berkelium, 242, was, synthesized, in, 1979, by, bombarding, 235, u, with, 11, b, 238, u, with, 10, b, 232, th, with, 14, n, or, 232, th, with, 15, n, it, converts, by, electron, capture, to, 242, cm, with, a, half, life, of, 7, 0, 1, 3, minutes, a, search, for, an, initially, suspected, isotope, 241, bk, was, then, unsuccessful, 241, bk, has, since, been, synthesized, the, fact, that, berkelium, readily, assumes, oxidation, state, 4, in, solids, and, is, relatively, stable, in, this, state, in, liquids, greatly, assists, separation, of, berkelium, away, from, many, other, actinides, these, are, inevitably, produced, in, relatively, large, amounts, during, the, nuclear, synthesis, and, often, favor, the, 3, state, this, fact, was, not, yet, known, in, the, initial, experiments, which, used, a, more, complex, separation, procedure, various, inorganic, oxidation, agents, can, be, applied, to, the, berkelium, iii, solutions, to, convert, it, to, the, 4, state, such, as, bromates, bro, 3, bismuthates, bio, 3, chromates, cro, 2, 4, and, cr, 2, o, 2, 7, silver, i, thiolate, ag, 2, s, 2, o, 8, lead, iv, oxide, pbo, 2, ozone, o, 3, or, photochemical, oxidation, procedures, more, recently, it, has, been, discovered, that, some, organic, and, bio, inspired, molecules, such, as, the, chelator, called, 3, 4, 3, li, 1, 2, hopo, can, also, oxidize, bk, iii, and, stabilize, bk, iv, under, mild, conditions, berkelium, iv, is, then, extracted, with, ion, exchange, extraction, chromatography, or, liquid, liquid, extraction, using, hdehp, bis, 2, ethylhexyl, phosphoric, acid, amines, tributyl, phosphate, or, various, other, reagents, these, procedures, separate, berkelium, from, most, trivalent, actinides, and, lanthanides, except, for, the, lanthanide, cerium, lanthanides, are, absent, in, the, irradiation, target, but, are, created, in, various, nuclear, fission, decay, chains, a, more, detailed, procedure, adopted, at, the, oak, ridge, national, laboratory, was, as, follows, the, initial, mixture, of, actinides, is, processed, with, ion, exchange, using, lithium, chloride, reagent, then, precipitated, as, hydroxides, filtered, and, dissolved, in, nitric, acid, it, is, then, treated, with, high, pressure, elution, from, cation, exchange, resins, and, the, berkelium, phase, is, oxidized, and, extracted, using, one, of, the, procedures, described, above, reduction, of, the, thus, obtained, berkelium, iv, to, the, 3, oxidation, state, yields, a, solution, which, is, nearly, free, from, other, actinides, but, contains, cerium, berkelium, and, cerium, are, then, separated, with, another, round, of, ion, exchange, treatment, in, order, to, characterize, chemical, and, physical, properties, of, solid, berkelium, and, its, compounds, a, program, was, initiated, in, 1952, at, the, material, testing, reactor, arco, idaho, us, it, resulted, in, preparation, of, an, eight, gram, plutonium, 239, target, and, in, the, first, production, of, macroscopic, quantities, 0, 6, micrograms, of, berkelium, by, burris, b, cunningham, and, stanley, gerald, thompson, in, 1958, after, a, continuous, reactor, irradiation, of, this, target, for, six, years, this, irradiation, method, was, and, still, is, the, only, way, of, producing, weighable, amounts, of, the, element, and, most, solid, state, studies, of, berkelium, have, been, conducted, on, microgram, or, submicrogram, sized, samples, the, world, s, major, irradiation, sources, are, the, 85, megawatt, high, flux, isotope, reactor, at, the, oak, ridge, national, laboratory, in, tennessee, usa, and, the, sm, 2, loop, reactor, at, the, research, institute, of, atomic, reactors, niiar, in, dimitrovgrad, russia, which, are, both, dedicated, to, the, production, of, transcurium, elements, atomic, number, greater, than, 96, these, facilities, have, similar, power, and, flux, levels, and, are, expected, to, have, comparable, production, capacities, for, transcurium, elements, although, the, quantities, produced, at, niiar, are, not, publicly, reported, in, a, typical, processing, campaign, at, oak, ridge, tens, of, grams, of, curium, are, irradiated, to, produce, decigram, quantities, of, californium, milligram, quantities, of, berkelium, 249, and, einsteinium, and, picogram, quantities, of, fermium, in, total, just, over, one, gram, of, berkelium, 249, has, been, produced, at, oak, ridge, since, 1967, the, first, berkelium, metal, sample, weighing, 1, 7, micrograms, was, prepared, in, 1971, by, the, reduction, of, berkelium, iii, fluoride, with, lithium, vapor, at, 1000, c, the, fluoride, was, suspended, on, a, tungsten, wire, above, a, tantalum, crucible, containing, molten, lithium, later, metal, samples, weighing, up, to, 0, 5, milligrams, were, obtained, with, this, method, similar, results, are, obtained, with, berkelium, iv, fluoride, berkelium, metal, can, also, be, produced, by, the, reduction, of, berkelium, iv, oxide, with, thorium, or, lanthanum, two, oxides, of, berkelium, are, known, with, the, berkelium, oxidation, state, of, 3, bk, 2, o, 3, and, 4, bko, 2, berkelium, iv, oxide, is, a, brown, solid, while, berkelium, iii, oxide, is, a, yellow, green, solid, with, a, melting, point, of, 1920, c, and, is, formed, from, bko, 2, by, reduction, with, molecular, hydrogen, upon, heating, to, 1200, c, the, oxide, bk, 2, o, 3, undergoes, a, phase, change, it, undergoes, another, phase, change, at, 1750, c, such, three, phase, behavior, is, typical, for, the, actinide, sesquioxides, berkelium, ii, oxide, bko, has, been, reported, as, a, brittle, gray, solid, but, its, exact, chemical, composition, remains, uncertain, in, halides, berkelium, assumes, the, oxidation, states, 3, and, 4, the, 3, state, is, the, most, stable, especially, in, solutions, while, the, tetravalent, halides, bkf, 4, and, cs, 2, bkcl, 6, are, only, known, in, the, solid, phase, the, coordination, of, berkelium, atom, in, its, trivalent, fluoride, and, chloride, is, tricapped, trigonal, prismatic, with, the, coordination, number, of, 9, in, trivalent, bromide, it, is, bicapped, trigonal, prismatic, coordination, 8, or, octahedral, coordination, 6, and, in, the, iodide, it, is, octahedral, berkelium, iv, fluoride, bkf, 4, is, a, yellow, green, ionic, solid, and, is, isotypic, with, uranium, tetrafluoride, or, zirconium, tetrafluoride, berkelium, iii, fluoride, bkf, 3, is, also, a, yellow, green, solid, but, it, has, two, crystalline, structures, the, most, stable, phase, at, low, temperatures, is, isotypic, with, yttrium, iii, fluoride, while, upon, heating, to, between, 350, and, 600, c, it, transforms, to, the, structure, found, in, lanthanum, trifluoride, visible, amounts, of, berkelium, iii, chloride, bkcl, 3, were, first, isolated, and, characterized, in, 1962, and, weighed, only, 3, billionths, of, a, gram, it, can, be, prepared, by, introducing, hydrogen, chloride, vapors, into, an, evacuated, quartz, tube, containing, berkelium, oxide, at, a, temperature, about, 500, c, this, green, solid, has, a, melting, point, of, 600, c, and, is, isotypic, with, uranium, iii, chloride, upon, heating, to, nearly, melting, point, bkcl, 3, converts, into, an, orthorhombic, phase, two, forms, of, berkelium, iii, bromide, are, known, one, with, berkelium, having, coordination, 6, and, one, with, coordination, 8, the, latter, is, less, stable, and, transforms, to, the, former, phase, upon, heating, to, about, 350, c, an, important, phenomenon, for, radioactive, solids, has, been, studied, on, these, two, crystal, forms, the, structure, of, fresh, and, aged, 249, bkbr, 3, samples, was, probed, by, x, ray, diffraction, over, a, period, longer, than, 3, years, so, that, various, fractions, of, berkelium, 249, had, beta, decayed, to, californium, 249, no, change, in, structure, was, observed, upon, the, 249, bkbr, 3, 249, cfbr, 3, transformation, however, other, differences, were, noted, for, 249, bkbr, 3, and, 249, cfbr, 3, for, example, the, latter, could, be, reduced, with, hydrogen, to, 249, cfbr, 2, but, the, former, could, not, this, result, was, reproduced, on, individual, 249, bkbr, 3, and, 249, cfbr, 3, samples, as, well, on, the, samples, containing, both, bromides, the, intergrowth, of, californium, in, berkelium, occurs, at, a, rate, of, 0, 22, per, day, and, is, an, intrinsic, obstacle, in, studying, berkelium, properties, beside, a, chemical, contamination, 249, cf, being, an, alpha, emitter, brings, undesirable, self, damage, of, the, crystal, lattice, and, the, resulting, self, heating, the, chemical, effect, however, can, be, avoided, by, performing, measurements, as, a, function, of, time, and, extrapolating, the, obtained, results, the, pnictides, of, berkelium, 249, of, the, type, bkx, are, known, for, the, elements, nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, and, antimony, they, crystallize, in, the, rock, salt, structure, and, are, prepared, by, the, reaction, of, either, berkelium, iii, hydride, bkh, 3, or, metallic, berkelium, with, these, elements, at, elevated, temperature, about, 600, c, under, high, vacuum, berkelium, iii, sulfide, bk, 2, s, 3, is, prepared, by, either, treating, berkelium, oxide, with, a, mixture, of, hydrogen, sulfide, and, carbon, disulfide, vapors, at, 1130, c, or, by, directly, reacting, metallic, berkelium, with, elemental, sulfur, these, procedures, yield, brownish, black, crystals, berkelium, iii, and, berkelium, iv, hydroxides, are, both, stable, in, 1, molar, solutions, of, sodium, hydroxide, berkelium, iii, phosphate, bkpo, 4, has, been, prepared, as, a, solid, which, shows, strong, fluorescence, under, excitation, with, a, green, light, berkelium, hydrides, are, produced, by, reacting, metal, with, hydrogen, gas, at, temperatures, about, 250, c, they, are, non, stoichiometric, with, the, nominal, formula, bkh, 2, x, 0, x, 1, several, other, salts, of, berkelium, are, known, including, an, oxysulfide, bk, 2, o, 2, s, and, hydrated, nitrate, bk, no, 3, 3, 4h, 2, o, chloride, bkcl, 3, 6h, 2, o, sulfate, bk, 2, so, 4, 3, 12h, 2, o, and, oxalate, bk, 2, c, 2, o, 4, 3, 4h, 2, o, thermal, decomposition, at, about, 600, c, in, an, argon, atmosphere, to, avoid, oxidation, to, bko, 2, of, bk, 2, so, 4, 3, 12h, 2, o, yields, the, crystals, of, berkelium, iii, oxysulfate, bk, 2, o, 2, so, 4, this, compound, is, thermally, stable, to, at, least, 1000, c, in, inert, atmosphere, berkelium, forms, a, trigonal, 5, c, 5, h, 5, 3, bk, metallocene, complex, with, three, cyclopentadienyl, rings, which, can, be, synthesized, by, reacting, berkelium, iii, chloride, with, the, molten, beryllocene, be, c, 5, h, 5, 2, at, about, 70, c, it, has, an, amber, color, and, a, density, of, 2, 47, g, cm, 3, the, complex, is, stable, to, heating, to, at, least, 250, c, and, sublimates, without, melting, at, about, 350, c, the, high, radioactivity, of, berkelium, gradually, destroys, the, compound, within, a, period, of, weeks, one, cyclopentadienyl, ring, in, 5, c, 5, h, 5, 3, bk, can, be, substituted, by, chlorine, to, yield, 2, the, optical, absorption, spectra, of, this, compound, are, very, similar, to, those, of, 5, c, 5, h, 5, 3, bk, there, is, currently, no, use, for, any, isotope, of, berkelium, outside, basic, scientific, research, berkelium, 249, is, a, common, target, nuclide, to, prepare, still, heavier, transuranium, elements, and, superheavy, elements, such, as, lawrencium, rutherfordium, and, bohrium, it, is, also, useful, as, a, source, of, the, isotope, californium, 249, which, is, used, for, studies, on, the, chemistry, of, californium, in, preference, to, the, more, radioactive, californium, 252, that, is, produced, in, neutron, bombardment, facilities, such, as, the, hfir, a, 22, milligram, batch, of, berkelium, 249, was, prepared, in, a, 250, day, irradiation, and, then, purified, for, 90, days, at, oak, ridge, in, 2009, this, target, yielded, the, first, 6, atoms, of, tennessine, at, the, joint, institute, for, nuclear, research, jinr, dubna, russia, after, bombarding, it, with, calcium, ions, in, the, u400, cyclotron, for, 150, days, this, synthesis, was, a, culmination, of, the, russia, us, collaboration, between, jinr, and, lawrence, livermore, national, laboratory, on, the, synthesis, of, elements, 113, to, 118, which, was, initiated, in, 1989, the, nuclear, fission, properties, of, berkelium, are, different, from, those, of, the, neighboring, actinides, curium, and, californium, and, they, suggest, berkelium, to, perform, poorly, as, a, fuel, in, a, nuclear, reactor, specifically, berkelium, 249, has, a, moderately, large, neutron, capture, cross, section, of, 710, barns, for, thermal, neutrons, 1200, barns, resonance, integral, but, very, low, fission, cross, section, for, thermal, neutrons, in, a, thermal, reactor, much, of, it, will, therefore, be, converted, to, berkelium, 250, which, quickly, decays, to, californium, 250, in, principle, berkelium, 249, can, sustain, a, nuclear, chain, reaction, in, a, fast, breeder, reactor, its, critical, mass, is, relatively, high, at, 192, kg, which, can, be, reduced, with, a, water, or, steel, reflector, but, would, still, exceed, the, world, production, of, this, isotope, berkelium, 247, can, maintain, a, chain, reaction, both, in, a, thermal, neutron, and, in, a, fast, neutron, reactor, however, its, production, is, rather, complex, and, thus, the, availability, is, much, lower, than, its, critical, mass, which, is, about, 75, 7, kg, for, a, bare, sphere, 41, 2, kg, with, a, water, reflector, and, 35, 2, kg, with, a, steel, reflector, 30, cm, thickness, little, is, known, about, the, effects, of, berkelium, on, human, body, and, analogies, with, other, elements, may, not, be, drawn, because, of, different, radiation, products, electrons, for, berkelium, and, alpha, particles, neutrons, or, both, for, most, other, actinides, the, low, energy, of, electrons, emitted, from, berkelium, 249, less, than, 126, kev, hinders, its, detection, due, to, signal, interference, with, other, decay, processes, but, also, makes, this, isotope, relatively, harmless, to, humans, as, compared, to, other, actinides, however, berkelium, 249, transforms, with, a, half, life, of, only, 330, days, to, the, strong, alpha, emitter, californium, 249, which, is, rather, dangerous, and, has, to, be, handled, in, a, glovebox, in, a, dedicated, laboratory, most, available, berkelium, toxicity, data, originate, from, research, on, animals, upon, ingestion, by, rats, only, about, 0, 01, of, berkelium, ends, in, the, blood, stream, from, there, about, 65, goes, to, the, bones, where, it, remains, for, about, 50, years, 25, to, the, lungs, biological, half, life, about, 20, years, 0, 035, to, the, testicles, or, 0, 01, to, the, ovaries, where, berkelium, stays, indefinitely, the, balance, of, about, 10, is, excreted, in, all, these, organs, berkelium, might, promote, cancer, and, in, the, skeleton, its, radiation, can, damage, red, blood, cells, the, maximum, permissible, amount, of, berkelium, 249, in, the, human, skeleton, is, 0, 4, nanograms
