in, physics, gravitational, acceleration, is, the, acceleration, of, an, object, in, free, fall, within, a, vacuum, and, thus, without, experiencing, drag, this, is, the, steady, gain, in, speed, caused, exclusively, by, gravitational, attraction, all, bodies, accelerate, in, vacuum, at, the, same, rate, regardless, of, the, masses, or, compositions, of, the, bodies, the, measurement, and, analysis, of, these, rates, is, known, as, gravimetry, at, a, fixed, point, on, the, surface, the, magnitude, of, earth, s, gravity, results, from, combined, effect, of, gravitation, and, the, centrifugal, force, from, earth, s, rotation, at, different, points, on, earth, s, surface, the, free, fall, acceleration, ranges, from, 9, 764, to, 9, 834, m, s, 2, 32, 03, to, 32, 26, ft, s, 2, depending, on, altitude, latitude, and, longitude, a, conventional, standard, value, is, defined, exactly, as, 9, 80665, m, s, about, 32, 1740, ft, s, locations, of, significant, variation, from, this, value, are, known, as, gravity, anomalies, this, does, not, take, into, account, other, effects, such, as, buoyancy, or, drag, newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, states, that, there, is, a, gravitational, force, between, any, two, masses, that, is, equal, in, magnitude, for, each, mass, and, is, aligned, to, draw, the, two, masses, toward, each, other, the, formula, is, where, m, 1, displaystyle, m, 1, and, m, 2, displaystyle, m, 2, are, any, two, masses, g, displaystyle, g, is, the, gravitational, constant, and, r, displaystyle, r, is, the, distance, between, the, two, point, like, masses, using, the, integral, form, of, gauss, s, law, this, formula, can, be, extended, to, any, pair, of, objects, of, which, one, is, far, more, massive, than, the, other, like, a, planet, relative, to, any, man, scale, artifact, the, distances, between, planets, and, between, the, planets, and, the, sun, are, by, many, orders, of, magnitude, larger, than, the, sizes, of, the, sun, and, the, planets, in, consequence, both, the, sun, and, the, planets, can, be, considered, as, point, masses, and, the, same, formula, applied, to, planetary, motions, as, planets, and, natural, satellites, form, pairs, of, comparable, mass, the, distance, r, is, measured, from, the, common, centers, of, mass, of, each, pair, rather, than, the, direct, total, distance, between, planet, centers, if, one, mass, is, much, larger, than, the, other, it, is, convenient, to, take, it, as, observational, reference, and, define, it, as, source, of, a, gravitational, field, of, magnitude, and, orientation, given, by, where, m, displaystyle, m, is, the, mass, of, the, field, source, larger, and, r, displaystyle, mathbf, hat, r, is, a, unit, vector, directed, from, the, field, source, to, the, sample, smaller, mass, the, negative, sign, indicates, that, the, force, is, attractive, points, backward, toward, the, source, then, the, attraction, force, f, displaystyle, mathbf, f, vector, onto, a, sample, mass, m, displaystyle, m, can, be, expressed, as, here, g, displaystyle, mathbf, g, is, the, frictionless, free, fall, acceleration, sustained, by, the, sampling, mass, m, displaystyle, m, under, the, attraction, of, the, gravitational, source, it, is, a, vector, oriented, toward, the, field, source, of, magnitude, measured, in, acceleration, units, the, gravitational, acceleration, vector, depends, only, on, how, massive, the, field, source, m, displaystyle, m, is, and, on, the, distance, r, to, the, sample, mass, m, displaystyle, m, it, does, not, depend, on, the, magnitude, of, the, small, sample, mass, this, model, represents, the, far, field, gravitational, acceleration, associated, with, a, massive, body, when, the, dimensions, of, a, body, are, not, trivial, compared, to, the, distances, of, interest, the, principle, of, superposition, can, be, used, for, differential, masses, for, an, assumed, density, distribution, throughout, the, body, in, order, to, get, a, more, detailed, model, of, the, near, field, gravitational, acceleration, for, satellites, in, orbit, the, far, field, model, is, sufficient, for, rough, calculations, of, altitude, versus, period, but, not, for, precision, estimation, of, future, location, after, multiple, orbits, the, more, detailed, models, include, among, other, things, the, bulging, at, the, equator, for, the, earth, and, irregular, mass, concentrations, due, to, meteor, impacts, for, the, moon, the, gravity, recovery, and, climate, experiment, grace, mission, launched, in, 2002, consists, of, two, probes, nicknamed, tom, and, jerry, in, polar, orbit, around, the, earth, measuring, differences, in, the, distance, between, the, two, probes, in, order, to, more, precisely, determine, the, gravitational, field, around, the, earth, and, to, track, changes, that, occur, over, time, similarly, the, gravity, recovery, and, interior, laboratory, mission, from, 2011, to, 2012, consisted, of, two, probes, ebb, and, flow, in, polar, orbit, around, the, moon, to, more, precisely, determine, the, gravitational, field, for, future, navigational, purposes, and, to, infer, information, about, the, moon, s, physical, makeup, the, table, below, shows, comparative, gravitational, accelerations, at, the, surface, of, the, sun, the, earth, s, moon, each, of, the, planets, in, the, solar, system, and, their, major, moons, ceres, pluto, and, eris, for, gaseous, bodies, the, surface, is, taken, to, mean, visible, surface, the, cloud, tops, of, the, giant, planets, jupiter, saturn, uranus, and, neptune, and, the, sun, s, photosphere, the, values, in, the, table, have, not, been, de, rated, for, the, centrifugal, force, effect, of, planet, rotation, and, cloud, top, wind, speeds, for, the, giant, planets, and, therefore, generally, speaking, are, similar, to, the, actual, gravity, that, would, be, experienced, near, the, poles, for, reference, the, time, it, would, take, an, object, to, fall, 100, meters, the, height, of, a, skyscraper, is, shown, along, with, the, maximum, speed, reached, air, resistance, is, neglected, in, einstein, s, theory, of, general, relativity, gravitation, is, an, attribute, of, curved, spacetime, instead, of, being, due, to, a, force, propagated, between, bodies, in, einstein, s, theory, masses, distort, spacetime, in, their, vicinity, and, other, particles, move, in, trajectories, determined, by, the, geometry, of, spacetime, the, gravitational, force, is, a, fictitious, force, there, is, no, gravitational, acceleration, in, that, the, proper, acceleration, and, hence, four, acceleration, of, objects, in, free, fall, are, zero, rather, than, undergoing, an, acceleration, objects, in, free, fall, travel, along, straight, lines, geodesics, on, the, curved, spacetime, in, physics, a, gravitational, field, or, gravitational, acceleration, field, is, a, vector, field, used, to, explain, the, influences, that, a, body, extends, into, the, space, around, itself, a, gravitational, field, is, used, to, explain, gravitational, phenomena, such, as, the, gravitational, force, field, exerted, on, another, massive, body, it, has, dimension, of, acceleration, l, t, 2, and, it, is, measured, in, units, of, newtons, per, kilogram, n, kg, or, equivalently, in, meters, per, second, squared, m, s, 2, in, its, original, concept, gravity, was, a, force, between, point, masses, following, isaac, newton, pierre, simon, laplace, attempted, to, model, gravity, as, some, kind, of, radiation, field, or, fluid, and, since, the, 19th, century, explanations, for, gravity, in, classical, mechanics, have, usually, been, taught, in, terms, of, a, field, model, rather, than, a, point, attraction, it, results, from, the, spatial, gradient, of, the, gravitational, potential, field, in, general, relativity, rather, than, two, particles, attracting, each, other, the, particles, distort, spacetime, via, their, mass, and, this, distortion, is, what, is, perceived, and, measured, as, a, force, in, such, a, model, one, states, that, matter, moves, in, certain, ways, in, response, to, the, curvature, of, spacetime, and, that, there, is, either, no, gravitational, force, or, that, gravity, is, a, fictitious, force
