the, study, of, galaxy, formation, and, evolution, is, concerned, with, the, processes, that, formed, a, heterogeneous, universe, from, a, homogeneous, beginning, the, formation, of, the, first, galaxies, the, way, galaxies, change, over, time, and, the, processes, that, have, generated, the, variety, of, structures, observed, in, nearby, galaxies, galaxy, formation, is, hypothesized, to, occur, from, structure, formation, theories, as, a, result, of, tiny, quantum, fluctuations, in, the, aftermath, of, the, big, bang, the, simplest, model, in, general, agreement, with, observed, phenomena, is, the, lambda, cdm, model, that, is, clustering, and, merging, allows, galaxies, to, accumulate, mass, determining, both, their, shape, and, structure, hydrodynamics, simulation, which, simulates, both, baryons, and, dark, matter, is, widely, used, to, study, galaxy, formation, and, evolution, because, of, the, inability, to, conduct, experiments, in, outer, space, the, only, way, to, test, theories, and, models, of, galaxy, evolution, is, to, compare, them, with, observations, explanations, for, how, galaxies, formed, and, evolved, must, be, able, to, predict, the, observed, properties, and, types, of, galaxies, edwin, hubble, created, an, early, galaxy, classification, scheme, now, known, as, the, hubble, tuning, fork, diagram, it, partitioned, galaxies, into, ellipticals, normal, spirals, barred, spirals, such, as, the, milky, way, and, irregulars, these, galaxy, types, exhibit, the, following, properties, which, can, be, explained, by, current, galaxy, evolution, theories, astronomers, now, believe, that, disk, galaxies, likely, formed, first, then, evolved, into, elliptical, galaxies, through, galaxy, mergers, current, models, also, predict, that, the, majority, of, mass, in, galaxies, is, made, up, of, dark, matter, a, substance, which, is, not, directly, observable, and, might, not, interact, through, any, means, except, gravity, this, observation, arises, because, galaxies, could, not, have, formed, as, they, have, or, rotate, as, they, are, seen, to, unless, they, contain, far, more, mass, than, can, be, directly, observed, the, earliest, stage, in, the, evolution, of, galaxies, is, their, formation, when, a, galaxy, forms, it, has, a, disk, shape, and, is, called, a, spiral, galaxy, due, to, spiral, like, arm, structures, located, on, the, disk, there, are, different, theories, on, how, these, disk, like, distributions, of, stars, develop, from, a, cloud, of, matter, however, at, present, none, of, them, exactly, predicts, the, results, of, observation, olin, eggen, donald, lynden, bell, and, allan, sandage, in, 1962, proposed, a, theory, that, disk, galaxies, form, through, a, monolithic, collapse, of, a, large, gas, cloud, the, distribution, of, matter, in, the, early, universe, was, in, clumps, that, consisted, mostly, of, dark, matter, these, clumps, interacted, gravitationally, putting, tidal, torques, on, each, other, that, acted, to, give, them, some, angular, momentum, as, the, baryonic, matter, cooled, it, dissipated, some, energy, and, contracted, toward, the, center, with, angular, momentum, conserved, the, matter, near, the, center, speeds, up, its, rotation, then, like, a, spinning, ball, of, pizza, dough, the, matter, forms, into, a, tight, disk, once, the, disk, cools, the, gas, is, not, gravitationally, stable, so, it, cannot, remain, a, singular, homogeneous, cloud, it, breaks, and, these, smaller, clouds, of, gas, form, stars, since, the, dark, matter, does, not, dissipate, as, it, only, interacts, gravitationally, it, remains, distributed, outside, the, disk, in, what, is, known, as, the, dark, halo, observations, show, that, there, are, stars, located, outside, the, disk, which, does, not, quite, fit, the, pizza, dough, model, it, was, first, proposed, by, leonard, searle, and, robert, zinn, that, galaxies, form, by, the, coalescence, of, smaller, progenitors, known, as, a, top, down, formation, scenario, this, theory, is, quite, simple, yet, no, longer, widely, accepted, more, recent, theories, include, the, clustering, of, dark, matter, halos, in, the, bottom, up, process, instead, of, large, gas, clouds, collapsing, to, form, a, galaxy, in, which, the, gas, breaks, up, into, smaller, clouds, it, is, proposed, that, matter, started, out, in, these, smaller, clumps, mass, on, the, order, of, globular, clusters, and, then, many, of, these, clumps, merged, to, form, galaxies, which, then, were, drawn, by, gravitation, to, form, galaxy, clusters, this, still, results, in, disk, like, distributions, of, baryonic, matter, with, dark, matter, forming, the, halo, for, all, the, same, reasons, as, in, the, top, down, theory, models, using, this, sort, of, process, predict, more, small, galaxies, than, large, ones, which, matches, observations, astronomers, do, not, currently, know, what, process, stops, the, contraction, in, fact, theories, of, disk, galaxy, formation, are, not, successful, at, producing, the, rotation, speed, and, size, of, disk, galaxies, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, radiation, from, bright, newly, formed, stars, or, from, an, active, galactic, nucleus, can, slow, the, contraction, of, a, forming, disk, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, the, dark, matter, halo, can, pull, the, galaxy, thus, stopping, disk, contraction, the, lambda, cdm, model, is, a, cosmological, model, that, explains, the, formation, of, the, universe, after, the, big, bang, it, is, a, relatively, simple, model, that, predicts, many, properties, observed, in, the, universe, including, the, relative, frequency, of, different, galaxy, types, however, it, underestimates, the, number, of, thin, disk, galaxies, in, the, universe, the, reason, is, that, these, galaxy, formation, models, predict, a, large, number, of, mergers, if, disk, galaxies, merge, with, another, galaxy, of, comparable, mass, at, least, 15, percent, of, its, mass, the, merger, will, likely, destroy, or, at, a, minimum, greatly, disrupt, the, disk, and, the, resulting, galaxy, is, not, expected, to, be, a, disk, galaxy, see, next, section, while, this, remains, an, unsolved, problem, for, astronomers, it, does, not, necessarily, mean, that, the, lambda, cdm, model, is, completely, wrong, but, rather, that, it, requires, further, refinement, to, accurately, reproduce, the, population, of, galaxies, in, the, universe, elliptical, galaxies, most, notably, supergiant, ellipticals, such, as, eso, 306, 17, are, among, some, of, the, largest, known, thus, far, their, stars, are, on, orbits, that, are, randomly, oriented, within, the, galaxy, i, e, they, are, not, rotating, like, disk, galaxies, a, distinguishing, feature, of, elliptical, galaxies, is, that, the, velocity, of, the, stars, does, not, necessarily, contribute, to, flattening, of, the, galaxy, such, as, in, spiral, galaxies, elliptical, galaxies, have, central, supermassive, black, holes, and, the, masses, of, these, black, holes, correlate, with, the, galaxy, s, mass, elliptical, galaxies, have, two, main, stages, of, evolution, the, first, is, due, to, the, supermassive, black, hole, growing, by, accreting, cooling, gas, the, second, stage, is, marked, by, the, black, hole, stabilizing, by, suppressing, gas, cooling, thus, leaving, the, elliptical, galaxy, in, a, stable, state, the, mass, of, the, black, hole, is, also, correlated, to, a, property, called, sigma, which, is, the, dispersion, of, the, velocities, of, stars, in, their, orbits, this, relationship, known, as, the, m, sigma, relation, was, discovered, in, 2000, elliptical, galaxies, mostly, lack, disks, although, some, bulges, of, disk, galaxies, resemble, elliptical, galaxies, elliptical, galaxies, are, more, likely, found, in, crowded, regions, of, the, universe, such, as, galaxy, clusters, astronomers, now, see, elliptical, galaxies, as, some, of, the, most, evolved, systems, in, the, universe, it, is, widely, accepted, that, the, main, driving, force, for, the, evolution, of, elliptical, galaxies, is, mergers, of, smaller, galaxies, many, galaxies, in, the, universe, are, gravitationally, bound, to, other, galaxies, which, means, that, they, will, never, escape, their, mutual, pull, if, those, colliding, galaxies, are, of, similar, size, the, resultant, galaxy, will, appear, similar, to, neither, of, the, progenitors, but, will, instead, be, elliptical, there, are, many, types, of, galaxy, mergers, which, do, not, necessarily, result, in, elliptical, galaxies, but, result, in, a, structural, change, for, example, a, minor, merger, event, is, thought, to, be, occurring, between, the, milky, way, and, the, magellanic, clouds, mergers, between, such, large, galaxies, are, regarded, as, violent, and, the, frictional, interaction, of, the, gas, between, the, two, galaxies, can, cause, gravitational, shock, waves, which, are, capable, of, forming, new, stars, in, the, new, elliptical, galaxy, by, sequencing, several, images, of, different, galactic, collisions, one, can, observe, the, timeline, of, two, spiral, galaxies, merging, into, a, single, elliptical, galaxy, in, the, local, group, the, milky, way, and, the, andromeda, galaxy, are, gravitationally, bound, and, currently, approaching, each, other, at, high, speed, simulations, show, that, the, milky, way, and, andromeda, are, on, a, collision, course, and, are, expected, to, collide, in, less, than, five, billion, years, during, this, collision, it, is, expected, that, the, sun, and, the, rest, of, the, solar, system, will, be, ejected, from, its, current, path, around, the, milky, way, the, remnant, could, be, a, giant, elliptical, galaxy, one, observation, that, must, be, explained, by, a, successful, theory, of, galaxy, evolution, is, the, existence, of, two, different, populations, of, galaxies, on, the, galaxy, color, magnitude, diagram, most, galaxies, tend, to, fall, into, two, separate, locations, on, this, diagram, a, red, sequence, and, a, blue, cloud, red, sequence, galaxies, are, generally, non, star, forming, elliptical, galaxies, with, little, gas, and, dust, while, blue, cloud, galaxies, tend, to, be, dusty, star, forming, spiral, galaxies, as, described, in, previous, sections, galaxies, tend, to, evolve, from, spiral, to, elliptical, structure, via, mergers, however, the, current, rate, of, galaxy, mergers, does, not, explain, how, all, galaxies, move, from, the, blue, cloud, to, the, red, sequence, it, also, does, not, explain, how, star, formation, ceases, in, galaxies, theories, of, galaxy, evolution, must, therefore, be, able, to, explain, how, star, formation, turns, off, in, galaxies, this, phenomenon, is, called, galaxy, quenching, stars, form, out, of, cold, gas, see, also, the, kennicutt, schmidt, law, so, a, galaxy, is, quenched, when, it, has, no, more, cold, gas, however, it, is, thought, that, quenching, occurs, relatively, quickly, within, 1, billion, years, which, is, much, shorter, than, the, time, it, would, take, for, a, galaxy, to, simply, use, up, its, reservoir, of, cold, gas, galaxy, evolution, models, explain, this, by, hypothesizing, other, physical, mechanisms, that, remove, or, shut, off, the, supply, of, cold, gas, in, a, galaxy, these, mechanisms, can, be, broadly, classified, into, two, categories, 1, preventive, feedback, mechanisms, that, stop, cold, gas, from, entering, a, galaxy, or, stop, it, from, producing, stars, and, 2, ejective, feedback, mechanisms, that, remove, gas, so, that, it, cannot, form, stars, one, theorized, preventive, mechanism, called, strangulation, keeps, cold, gas, from, entering, the, galaxy, strangulation, is, likely, the, main, mechanism, for, quenching, star, formation, in, nearby, low, mass, galaxies, the, exact, physical, explanation, for, strangulation, is, still, unknown, but, it, may, have, to, do, with, a, galaxy, s, interactions, with, other, galaxies, as, a, galaxy, falls, into, a, galaxy, cluster, gravitational, interactions, with, other, galaxies, can, strangle, it, by, preventing, it, from, accreting, more, gas, for, galaxies, with, massive, dark, matter, halos, another, preventive, mechanism, called, virial, shock, heating, may, also, prevent, gas, from, becoming, cool, enough, to, form, stars, ejective, processes, which, expel, cold, gas, from, galaxies, may, explain, how, more, massive, galaxies, are, quenched, one, ejective, mechanism, is, caused, by, supermassive, black, holes, found, in, the, centers, of, galaxies, simulations, have, shown, that, gas, accreting, onto, supermassive, black, holes, in, galactic, centers, produces, high, energy, jets, the, released, energy, can, expel, enough, cold, gas, to, quench, star, formation, our, own, milky, way, and, the, nearby, andromeda, galaxy, currently, appear, to, be, undergoing, the, quenching, transition, from, star, forming, blue, galaxies, to, passive, red, galaxies, dark, energy, and, dark, matter, account, for, most, of, the, universe, s, energy, so, it, is, valid, to, ignore, baryons, when, simulating, large, scale, structure, formation, using, methods, such, as, n, body, simulation, however, since, the, visible, components, of, galaxies, consist, of, baryons, it, is, crucial, to, include, baryons, in, the, simulation, to, study, the, detailed, structures, of, galaxies, at, first, the, baryon, component, consists, of, mostly, hydrogen, and, helium, gas, which, later, transforms, into, stars, during, the, formation, of, structures, from, observations, models, used, in, simulations, can, be, tested, and, the, understanding, of, different, stages, of, galaxy, formation, can, be, improved, in, cosmological, simulations, astrophysical, gases, are, typically, modeled, as, inviscid, ideal, gases, that, follow, the, euler, equations, which, can, be, expressed, mainly, in, three, different, ways, lagrangian, eulerian, or, arbitrary, lagrange, eulerian, methods, different, methods, give, specific, forms, of, hydrodynamical, equations, when, using, the, lagrangian, approach, to, specify, the, field, it, is, assumed, that, the, observer, tracks, a, specific, fluid, parcel, with, its, unique, characteristics, during, its, movement, through, space, and, time, in, contrast, the, eulerian, approach, emphasizes, particular, locations, in, space, that, the, fluid, passes, through, as, time, progresses, to, shape, the, population, of, galaxies, the, hydrodynamical, equations, must, be, supplemented, by, a, variety, of, astrophysical, processes, mainly, governed, by, baryonic, physics, processes, such, as, collisional, excitation, ionization, and, inverse, compton, scattering, can, cause, the, internal, energy, of, the, gas, to, be, dissipated, in, the, simulation, cooling, processes, are, realized, by, coupling, cooling, functions, to, energy, equations, besides, the, primordial, cooling, at, high, temperature, 10, 5, k, t, 10, 7, k, displaystyle, 10, 5, k, t, 10, 7, k, heavy, elements, metals, cooling, dominates, when, t, 10, 4, k, displaystyle, t, 10, 4, k, the, fine, structure, and, molecular, cooling, also, need, to, be, considered, to, simulate, the, cold, phase, of, the, interstellar, medium, complex, multi, phase, structure, including, relativistic, particles, and, magnetic, field, makes, simulation, of, interstellar, medium, difficult, in, particular, modeling, the, cold, phase, of, the, interstellar, medium, poses, technical, difficulties, due, to, the, short, timescales, associated, with, the, dense, gas, in, the, early, simulations, the, dense, gas, phase, is, frequently, not, modeled, directly, but, rather, characterized, by, an, effective, polytropic, equation, of, state, more, recent, simulations, use, a, multimodal, distribution, to, describe, the, gas, density, and, temperature, distributions, which, directly, model, the, multi, phase, structure, however, more, detailed, physics, processes, needed, to, be, considered, in, future, simulations, since, the, structure, of, the, interstellar, medium, directly, affects, star, formation, as, cold, and, dense, gas, accumulates, it, undergoes, gravitational, collapse, and, eventually, forms, stars, to, simulate, this, process, a, portion, of, the, gas, is, transformed, into, collisionless, star, particles, which, represent, coeval, single, metallicity, stellar, populations, and, are, described, by, an, initial, underlying, mass, function, observations, suggest, that, star, formation, efficiency, in, molecular, gas, is, almost, universal, with, around, 1, of, the, gas, being, converted, into, stars, per, free, fall, time, in, simulations, the, gas, is, typically, converted, into, star, particles, using, a, probabilistic, sampling, scheme, based, on, the, calculated, star, formation, rate, some, simulations, seek, an, alternative, to, the, probabilistic, sampling, scheme, and, aim, to, better, capture, the, clustered, nature, of, star, formation, by, treating, star, clusters, as, the, fundamental, unit, of, star, formation, this, approach, permits, the, growth, of, star, particles, by, accreting, material, from, the, surrounding, medium, in, addition, to, this, modern, models, of, galaxy, formation, track, the, evolution, of, these, stars, and, the, mass, they, return, to, the, gas, component, leading, to, an, enrichment, of, the, gas, with, metals, stars, have, an, influence, on, their, surrounding, gas, by, injecting, energy, and, momentum, this, creates, a, feedback, loop, that, regulates, the, process, of, star, formation, to, effectively, control, star, formation, stellar, feedback, must, generate, galactic, scale, outflows, that, expel, gas, from, galaxies, various, methods, are, utilized, to, couple, energy, and, momentum, particularly, through, supernova, explosions, to, the, surrounding, gas, these, methods, differ, in, how, the, energy, is, deposited, either, thermally, or, kinetically, however, excessive, radiative, gas, cooling, must, be, avoided, in, the, former, case, cooling, is, expected, in, dense, and, cold, gas, but, it, cannot, be, reliably, modeled, in, cosmological, simulations, due, to, low, resolution, this, leads, to, artificial, and, excessive, cooling, of, the, gas, causing, the, supernova, feedback, energy, to, be, lost, via, radiation, and, significantly, reducing, its, effectiveness, in, the, latter, case, kinetic, energy, cannot, be, radiated, away, until, it, thermalizes, however, using, hydrodynamically, decoupled, wind, particles, to, inject, momentum, non, locally, into, the, gas, surrounding, active, star, forming, regions, may, still, be, necessary, to, achieve, large, scale, galactic, outflows, recent, models, explicitly, model, stellar, feedback, these, models, not, only, incorporate, supernova, feedback, but, also, consider, other, feedback, channels, such, as, energy, and, momentum, injection, from, stellar, winds, photoionization, and, radiation, pressure, resulting, from, radiation, emitted, by, young, massive, stars, during, the, cosmic, dawn, galaxy, formation, occurred, in, short, bursts, of, 5, to, 30, myr, due, to, stellar, feedbacks, simulation, of, supermassive, black, holes, is, also, considered, numerically, seeding, them, in, dark, matter, haloes, due, to, their, observation, in, many, galaxies, and, the, impact, of, their, mass, on, the, mass, density, distribution, their, mass, accretion, rate, is, frequently, modeled, by, the, bondi, hoyle, model, active, galactic, nuclei, agn, have, an, impact, on, the, observational, phenomena, of, supermassive, black, holes, and, further, have, a, regulation, of, black, hole, growth, and, star, formation, in, simulations, agn, feedback, is, usually, classified, into, two, modes, namely, quasar, and, radio, mode, quasar, mode, feedback, is, linked, to, the, radiatively, efficient, mode, of, black, hole, growth, and, is, frequently, incorporated, through, energy, or, momentum, injection, the, regulation, of, star, formation, in, massive, galaxies, is, believed, to, be, significantly, influenced, by, radio, mode, feedback, which, occurs, due, to, the, presence, of, highly, collimated, jets, of, relativistic, particles, these, jets, are, typically, linked, to, x, ray, bubbles, that, possess, enough, energy, to, counterbalance, cooling, losses, the, ideal, magnetohydrodynamics, approach, is, commonly, utilized, in, cosmological, simulations, since, it, provides, a, good, approximation, for, cosmological, magnetic, fields, the, effect, of, magnetic, fields, on, the, dynamics, of, gas, is, generally, negligible, on, large, cosmological, scales, nevertheless, magnetic, fields, are, a, critical, component, of, the, interstellar, medium, since, they, provide, pressure, support, against, gravity, and, affect, the, propagation, of, cosmic, rays, cosmic, rays, play, a, significant, role, in, the, interstellar, medium, by, contributing, to, its, pressure, serving, as, a, crucial, heating, channel, and, potentially, driving, galactic, gas, outflows, the, propagation, of, cosmic, rays, is, highly, affected, by, magnetic, fields, so, in, the, simulation, equations, describing, the, cosmic, ray, energy, and, flux, are, coupled, to, magnetohydrodynamics, equations, radiation, hydrodynamics, simulations, are, computational, methods, used, to, study, the, interaction, of, radiation, with, matter, in, astrophysical, contexts, radiation, hydrodynamics, is, used, to, study, the, epoch, of, reionization, when, the, universe, had, high, redshift, there, are, several, numerical, methods, used, for, radiation, hydrodynamics, simulations, including, ray, tracing, monte, carlo, and, moment, based, methods, ray, tracing, involves, tracing, the, paths, of, individual, photons, through, the, simulation, and, computing, their, interactions, with, matter, at, each, step, this, method, is, computationally, expensive, but, can, produce, very, accurate, results
