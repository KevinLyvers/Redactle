a, volcano, is, a, rupture, in, the, crust, of, a, planetary, mass, object, such, as, earth, that, allows, hot, lava, volcanic, ash, and, gases, to, escape, from, a, magma, chamber, below, the, surface, the, process, that, forms, volcanoes, is, called, volcanism, on, earth, volcanoes, are, most, often, found, where, tectonic, plates, are, diverging, or, converging, and, because, most, of, earth, s, plate, boundaries, are, underwater, most, volcanoes, are, found, underwater, for, example, a, mid, ocean, ridge, such, as, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, has, volcanoes, caused, by, divergent, tectonic, plates, whereas, the, pacific, ring, of, fire, has, volcanoes, caused, by, convergent, tectonic, plates, volcanoes, can, also, form, where, there, is, stretching, and, thinning, of, the, crust, s, plates, such, as, in, the, east, african, rift, the, wells, gray, clearwater, volcanic, field, and, the, rio, grande, rift, in, north, america, volcanism, away, from, plate, boundaries, has, been, postulated, to, arise, from, upwelling, diapirs, from, the, core, mantle, boundary, 3, 000, kilometers, 1, 900, mi, deep, within, earth, this, results, in, hotspot, volcanism, of, which, the, hawaiian, hotspot, is, an, example, volcanoes, are, usually, not, created, where, two, tectonic, plates, slide, past, one, another, large, eruptions, can, affect, atmospheric, temperature, as, ash, and, droplets, of, sulfuric, acid, obscure, the, sun, and, cool, earth, s, troposphere, historically, large, volcanic, eruptions, have, been, followed, by, volcanic, winters, which, have, caused, catastrophic, famines, other, planets, besides, earth, have, volcanoes, for, example, volcanoes, are, very, numerous, on, venus, in, 2009, a, paper, was, published, suggesting, a, new, definition, for, the, word, volcano, that, includes, processes, such, as, cryovolcanism, it, suggested, that, a, volcano, be, defined, as, an, opening, on, a, planet, or, moon, s, surface, from, which, magma, as, defined, for, that, body, and, or, magmatic, gas, is, erupted, this, article, mainly, covers, volcanoes, on, earth, see, volcanoes, on, other, celestial, bodies, and, cryovolcano, for, more, information, the, word, volcano, is, derived, from, the, name, of, vulcano, a, volcanic, island, in, the, aeolian, islands, of, italy, whose, name, in, turn, comes, from, vulcan, the, god, of, fire, in, roman, mythology, the, study, of, volcanoes, is, called, volcanology, sometimes, spelled, vulcanology, according, to, the, theory, of, plate, tectonics, earth, s, lithosphere, its, rigid, outer, shell, is, broken, into, sixteen, larger, and, several, smaller, plates, these, are, in, slow, motion, due, to, convection, in, the, underlying, ductile, mantle, and, most, volcanic, activity, on, earth, takes, place, along, plate, boundaries, where, plates, are, converging, and, lithosphere, is, being, destroyed, or, are, diverging, and, new, lithosphere, is, being, created, during, the, development, of, geological, theory, certain, concepts, that, allowed, the, grouping, of, volcanoes, in, time, place, structure, and, composition, have, developed, that, ultimately, have, had, to, be, explained, in, the, theory, of, plate, tectonics, for, example, some, volcanoes, are, polygenetic, with, more, than, one, period, of, activity, during, their, history, other, volcanoes, that, become, extinct, after, erupting, exactly, once, are, monogenetic, meaning, one, life, and, such, volcanoes, are, often, grouped, together, in, a, geographical, region, at, the, mid, ocean, ridges, two, tectonic, plates, diverge, from, one, another, as, hot, mantle, rock, creeps, upwards, beneath, the, thinned, oceanic, crust, the, decrease, of, pressure, in, the, rising, mantle, rock, leads, to, adiabatic, expansion, and, the, partial, melting, of, the, rock, causing, volcanism, and, creating, new, oceanic, crust, most, divergent, plate, boundaries, are, at, the, bottom, of, the, oceans, and, so, most, volcanic, activity, on, earth, is, submarine, forming, new, seafloor, black, smokers, also, known, as, deep, sea, vents, are, evidence, of, this, kind, of, volcanic, activity, where, the, mid, oceanic, ridge, is, above, sea, level, volcanic, islands, are, formed, such, as, iceland, subduction, zones, are, places, where, two, plates, usually, an, oceanic, plate, and, a, continental, plate, collide, the, oceanic, plate, subducts, dives, beneath, the, continental, plate, forming, a, deep, ocean, trench, just, offshore, in, a, process, called, flux, melting, water, released, from, the, subducting, plate, lowers, the, melting, temperature, of, the, overlying, mantle, wedge, thus, creating, magma, this, magma, tends, to, be, extremely, viscous, because, of, its, high, silica, content, so, it, often, does, not, reach, the, surface, but, cools, and, solidifies, at, depth, when, it, does, reach, the, surface, however, a, volcano, is, formed, thus, subduction, zones, are, bordered, by, chains, of, volcanoes, called, volcanic, arcs, typical, examples, are, the, volcanoes, in, the, pacific, ring, of, fire, such, as, the, cascade, volcanoes, or, the, japanese, archipelago, or, the, eastern, islands, of, indonesia, hotspots, are, volcanic, areas, thought, to, be, formed, by, mantle, plumes, which, are, hypothesized, to, be, columns, of, hot, material, rising, from, the, core, mantle, boundary, as, with, mid, ocean, ridges, the, rising, mantle, rock, experiences, decompression, melting, which, generates, large, volumes, of, magma, because, tectonic, plates, move, across, mantle, plumes, each, volcano, becomes, inactive, as, it, drifts, off, the, plume, and, new, volcanoes, are, created, where, the, plate, advances, over, the, plume, the, hawaiian, islands, are, thought, to, have, been, formed, in, such, a, manner, as, has, the, snake, river, plain, with, the, yellowstone, caldera, being, part, of, the, north, american, plate, currently, above, the, yellowstone, hotspot, however, the, mantle, plume, hypothesis, has, been, questioned, sustained, upwelling, of, hot, mantle, rock, can, develop, under, the, interior, of, a, continent, and, lead, to, rifting, early, stages, of, rifting, are, characterized, by, flood, basalts, and, may, progress, to, the, point, where, a, tectonic, plate, is, completely, split, a, divergent, plate, boundary, then, develops, between, the, two, halves, of, the, split, plate, however, rifting, often, fails, to, completely, split, the, continental, lithosphere, such, as, in, an, aulacogen, and, failed, rifts, are, characterized, by, volcanoes, that, erupt, unusual, alkali, lava, or, carbonatites, examples, include, the, volcanoes, of, the, east, african, rift, a, volcano, needs, a, reservoir, of, molten, magma, e, g, a, magma, chamber, a, conduit, to, allow, magma, to, rise, through, the, crust, and, a, vent, to, allow, the, magma, to, escape, above, the, surface, as, lava, the, erupted, volcanic, material, lava, and, tephra, that, is, deposited, around, the, vent, is, known, as, a, volcanic, edifice, typically, a, volcanic, cone, or, mountain, the, most, common, perception, of, a, volcano, is, of, a, conical, mountain, spewing, lava, and, poisonous, gases, from, a, crater, at, its, summit, however, this, describes, just, one, of, the, many, types, of, volcano, the, features, of, volcanoes, are, varied, the, structure, and, behavior, of, volcanoes, depend, on, several, factors, some, volcanoes, have, rugged, peaks, formed, by, lava, domes, rather, than, a, summit, crater, while, others, have, landscape, features, such, as, massive, plateaus, vents, that, issue, volcanic, material, including, lava, and, ash, and, gases, mainly, steam, and, magmatic, gases, can, develop, anywhere, on, the, landform, and, may, give, rise, to, smaller, cones, such, as, pu, u, on, a, flank, of, k, lauea, in, hawaii, volcanic, craters, are, not, always, at, the, top, of, a, mountain, or, hill, and, may, be, filled, with, lakes, such, as, with, lake, taup, in, new, zealand, some, volcanoes, can, be, low, relief, landform, features, with, the, potential, to, be, hard, to, recognise, as, such, and, be, obscured, by, geological, processes, other, types, of, volcano, include, cryovolcanoes, or, ice, volcanoes, particularly, on, some, moons, of, jupiter, saturn, and, neptune, and, mud, volcanoes, which, are, structures, often, not, associated, with, known, magmatic, activity, active, mud, volcanoes, tend, to, involve, temperatures, much, lower, than, those, of, igneous, volcanoes, except, when, the, mud, volcano, is, actually, a, vent, of, an, igneous, volcano, volcanic, fissure, vents, are, flat, linear, fractures, through, which, lava, emerges, shield, volcanoes, so, named, for, their, broad, shield, like, profiles, are, formed, by, the, eruption, of, low, viscosity, lava, that, can, flow, a, great, distance, from, a, vent, they, generally, do, not, explode, catastrophically, but, are, characterized, by, relatively, gentle, effusive, eruptions, since, low, viscosity, magma, is, typically, low, in, silica, shield, volcanoes, are, more, common, in, oceanic, than, continental, settings, the, hawaiian, volcanic, chain, is, a, series, of, shield, cones, and, they, are, common, in, iceland, as, well, lava, domes, are, built, by, slow, eruptions, of, highly, viscous, lava, they, are, sometimes, formed, within, the, crater, of, a, previous, volcanic, eruption, as, in, the, case, of, mount, st, helens, but, can, also, form, independently, as, in, the, case, of, lassen, peak, like, stratovolcanoes, they, can, produce, violent, explosive, eruptions, but, the, lava, generally, does, not, flow, far, from, the, originating, vent, cryptodomes, are, formed, when, viscous, lava, is, forced, upward, causing, the, surface, to, bulge, the, 1980, eruption, of, mount, st, helens, was, an, example, lava, beneath, the, surface, of, the, mountain, created, an, upward, bulge, which, later, collapsed, down, the, north, side, of, the, mountain, cinder, cones, result, from, eruptions, of, mostly, small, pieces, of, scoria, and, pyroclastics, both, resemble, cinders, hence, the, name, of, this, volcano, type, that, build, up, around, the, vent, these, can, be, relatively, short, lived, eruptions, that, produce, a, cone, shaped, hill, perhaps, 30, to, 400, meters, 100, to, 1, 300, ft, high, most, cinder, cones, erupt, only, once, and, some, may, be, found, in, monogenetic, volcanic, fields, that, may, include, other, features, that, form, when, magma, comes, into, contact, with, water, such, as, maar, explosion, craters, and, tuff, rings, cinder, cones, may, form, as, flank, vents, on, larger, volcanoes, or, occur, on, their, own, par, cutin, in, mexico, and, sunset, crater, in, arizona, are, examples, of, cinder, cones, in, new, mexico, caja, del, rio, is, a, volcanic, field, of, over, 60, cinder, cones, based, on, satellite, images, it, has, been, suggested, that, cinder, cones, might, occur, on, other, terrestrial, bodies, in, the, solar, system, too, on, the, surface, of, mars, and, the, moon, stratovolcanoes, composite, volcanoes, are, tall, conical, mountains, composed, of, lava, flows, and, tephra, in, alternate, layers, the, strata, that, gives, rise, to, the, name, they, are, also, known, as, composite, volcanoes, because, they, are, created, from, multiple, structures, during, different, kinds, of, eruptions, classic, examples, include, mount, fuji, in, japan, mayon, volcano, in, the, philippines, and, mount, vesuvius, and, stromboli, in, italy, ash, produced, by, the, explosive, eruption, of, stratovolcanoes, has, historically, posed, the, greatest, volcanic, hazard, to, civilizations, the, lavas, of, stratovolcanoes, are, higher, in, silica, and, therefore, much, more, viscous, than, lavas, from, shield, volcanoes, high, silica, lavas, also, tend, to, contain, more, dissolved, gas, the, combination, is, deadly, promoting, explosive, eruptions, that, produce, great, quantities, of, ash, as, well, as, pyroclastic, surges, like, the, one, that, destroyed, the, city, of, saint, pierre, in, martinique, in, 1902, they, are, also, steeper, than, shield, volcanoes, with, slopes, of, 30, 35, compared, to, slopes, of, generally, 5, 10, and, their, loose, tephra, are, material, for, dangerous, lahars, large, pieces, of, tephra, are, called, volcanic, bombs, big, bombs, can, measure, more, than, 1, 2, meters, 4, ft, across, and, weigh, several, tons, a, supervolcano, is, defined, as, a, volcano, that, has, experienced, one, or, more, eruptions, that, produced, over, 1, 000, cubic, kilometers, 240, cu, mi, of, volcanic, deposits, in, a, single, explosive, event, such, eruptions, occur, when, a, very, large, magma, chamber, full, of, gas, rich, silicic, magma, is, emptied, in, a, catastrophic, caldera, forming, eruption, ash, flow, tuffs, emplaced, by, such, eruptions, are, the, only, volcanic, product, with, volumes, rivaling, those, of, flood, basalts, supervolcano, eruptions, while, the, most, dangerous, type, are, very, rare, four, are, known, from, the, last, million, years, and, about, 60, historical, vei, 8, eruptions, have, been, identified, in, the, geologic, record, over, millions, of, years, a, supervolcano, can, produce, devastation, on, a, continental, scale, and, severely, cool, global, temperatures, for, many, years, after, the, eruption, due, to, the, huge, volumes, of, sulfur, and, ash, released, into, the, atmosphere, because, of, the, enormous, area, they, cover, and, subsequent, concealment, under, vegetation, and, glacial, deposits, supervolcanoes, can, be, difficult, to, identify, in, the, geologic, record, without, careful, geologic, mapping, known, examples, include, yellowstone, caldera, in, yellowstone, national, park, and, valles, caldera, in, new, mexico, both, western, united, states, lake, taup, in, new, zealand, lake, toba, in, sumatra, indonesia, and, ngorongoro, crater, in, tanzania, volcanoes, that, though, large, are, not, large, enough, to, be, called, supervolcanoes, may, also, form, calderas, in, the, same, way, they, are, often, described, as, caldera, volcanoes, submarine, volcanoes, are, common, features, of, the, ocean, floor, volcanic, activity, during, the, holocene, epoch, has, been, documented, at, only, 119, submarine, volcanoes, but, there, may, be, more, than, one, million, geologically, young, submarine, volcanoes, on, the, ocean, floor, in, shallow, water, active, volcanoes, disclose, their, presence, by, blasting, steam, and, rocky, debris, high, above, the, ocean, s, surface, in, the, deep, ocean, basins, the, tremendous, weight, of, the, water, prevents, the, explosive, release, of, steam, and, gases, however, submarine, eruptions, can, be, detected, by, hydrophones, and, by, the, discoloration, of, water, because, of, volcanic, gases, pillow, lava, is, a, common, eruptive, product, of, submarine, volcanoes, and, is, characterized, by, thick, sequences, of, discontinuous, pillow, shaped, masses, which, form, underwater, even, large, submarine, eruptions, may, not, disturb, the, ocean, surface, due, to, the, rapid, cooling, effect, and, increased, buoyancy, in, water, as, compared, to, air, which, often, causes, volcanic, vents, to, form, steep, pillars, on, the, ocean, floor, hydrothermal, vents, are, common, near, these, volcanoes, and, some, support, peculiar, ecosystems, based, on, chemotrophs, feeding, on, dissolved, minerals, over, time, the, formations, created, by, submarine, volcanoes, may, become, so, large, that, they, break, the, ocean, surface, as, new, islands, or, floating, pumice, rafts, in, may, and, june, 2018, a, multitude, of, seismic, signals, were, detected, by, earthquake, monitoring, agencies, all, over, the, world, they, took, the, form, of, unusual, humming, sounds, and, some, of, the, signals, detected, in, november, of, that, year, had, a, duration, of, up, to, 20, minutes, an, oceanographic, research, campaign, in, may, 2019, showed, that, the, previously, mysterious, humming, noises, were, caused, by, the, formation, of, a, submarine, volcano, off, the, coast, of, mayotte, subglacial, volcanoes, develop, underneath, ice, caps, they, are, made, up, of, lava, plateaus, capping, extensive, pillow, lavas, and, palagonite, these, volcanoes, are, also, called, table, mountains, tuyas, or, in, iceland, mobergs, very, good, examples, of, this, type, of, volcano, can, be, seen, in, iceland, and, in, british, columbia, the, origin, of, the, term, comes, from, tuya, butte, which, is, one, of, the, several, tuyas, in, the, area, of, the, tuya, river, and, tuya, range, in, northern, british, columbia, tuya, butte, was, the, first, such, landform, analyzed, and, so, its, name, has, entered, the, geological, literature, for, this, kind, of, volcanic, formation, the, tuya, mountains, provincial, park, was, recently, established, to, protect, this, unusual, landscape, which, lies, north, of, tuya, lake, and, south, of, the, jennings, river, near, the, boundary, with, the, yukon, territory, mud, volcanoes, mud, domes, are, formations, created, by, geo, excreted, liquids, and, gases, although, several, processes, may, cause, such, activity, the, largest, structures, are, 10, kilometers, in, diameter, and, reach, 700, meters, high, the, material, that, is, expelled, in, a, volcanic, eruption, can, be, classified, into, three, types, the, concentrations, of, different, volcanic, gases, can, vary, considerably, from, one, volcano, to, the, next, water, vapor, is, typically, the, most, abundant, volcanic, gas, followed, by, carbon, dioxide, and, sulfur, dioxide, other, principal, volcanic, gases, include, hydrogen, sulfide, hydrogen, chloride, and, hydrogen, fluoride, a, large, number, of, minor, and, trace, gases, are, also, found, in, volcanic, emissions, for, example, hydrogen, carbon, monoxide, halocarbons, organic, compounds, and, volatile, metal, chlorides, the, form, and, style, of, an, eruption, of, a, volcano, is, largely, determined, by, the, composition, of, the, lava, it, erupts, the, viscosity, how, fluid, the, lava, is, and, the, amount, of, dissolved, gas, are, the, most, important, characteristics, of, magma, and, both, are, largely, determined, by, the, amount, of, silica, in, the, magma, magma, rich, in, silica, is, much, more, viscous, than, silica, poor, magma, and, silica, rich, magma, also, tends, to, contain, more, dissolved, gases, lava, can, be, broadly, classified, into, four, different, compositions, mafic, lava, flows, show, two, varieties, of, surface, texture, a, a, pronounced, and, p, hoehoe, both, hawaiian, words, a, a, is, characterized, by, a, rough, clinkery, surface, and, is, the, typical, texture, of, cooler, basalt, lava, flows, p, hoehoe, is, characterized, by, its, smooth, and, often, ropey, or, wrinkly, surface, and, is, generally, formed, from, more, fluid, lava, flows, p, hoehoe, flows, are, sometimes, observed, to, transition, to, a, a, flows, as, they, move, away, from, the, vent, but, never, the, reverse, more, silicic, lava, flows, take, the, form, of, block, lava, where, the, flow, is, covered, with, angular, vesicle, poor, blocks, rhyolitic, flows, typically, consist, largely, of, obsidian, tephra, is, made, when, magma, inside, the, volcano, is, blown, apart, by, the, rapid, expansion, of, hot, volcanic, gases, magma, commonly, explodes, as, the, gas, dissolved, in, it, comes, out, of, solution, as, the, pressure, decreases, when, it, flows, to, the, surface, these, violent, explosions, produce, particles, of, material, that, can, then, fly, from, the, volcano, solid, particles, smaller, than, 2, mm, in, diameter, sand, sized, or, smaller, are, called, volcanic, ash, tephra, and, other, volcaniclastics, shattered, volcanic, material, make, up, more, of, the, volume, of, many, volcanoes, than, do, lava, flows, volcaniclastics, may, have, contributed, as, much, as, a, third, of, all, sedimentation, in, the, geologic, record, the, production, of, large, volumes, of, tephra, is, characteristic, of, explosive, volcanism, eruption, styles, are, broadly, divided, into, magmatic, phreatomagmatic, and, phreatic, eruptions, the, intensity, of, explosive, volcanism, is, expressed, using, the, volcanic, explosivity, index, vei, which, ranges, from, 0, for, hawaiian, type, eruptions, to, 8, for, supervolcanic, eruptions, as, of, december, 2022, the, smithsonian, institution, s, global, volcanism, program, database, of, volcanic, eruptions, in, the, holocene, epoch, the, last, 11, 700, years, lists, 9, 901, confirmed, eruptions, from, 859, volcanoes, the, database, also, lists, 1, 113, uncertain, eruptions, and, 168, discredited, eruptions, for, the, same, time, interval, volcanoes, vary, greatly, in, their, level, of, activity, with, individual, volcanic, systems, having, an, eruption, recurrence, ranging, from, several, times, a, year, to, once, in, tens, of, thousands, of, years, volcanoes, are, informally, described, as, erupting, active, dormant, or, extinct, but, the, definitions, of, these, terms, are, not, entirely, uniform, amongst, volcanologists, the, level, of, activity, of, most, volcanoes, falls, upon, a, graduated, spectrum, with, much, overlap, between, categories, and, does, not, always, fit, neatly, into, only, one, of, these, three, separate, categories, the, usgs, defines, a, volcano, as, erupting, whenever, the, ejection, of, magma, from, any, point, on, the, volcano, is, visible, including, visible, magma, still, contained, within, the, walls, of, the, summit, crater, while, there, is, no, international, consensus, among, volcanologists, on, how, to, define, an, active, volcano, the, usgs, defines, a, volcano, as, active, whenever, subterranean, indicators, such, as, earthquake, swarms, ground, inflation, or, unusually, high, levels, of, carbon, dioxide, or, sulfur, dioxide, are, present, the, usgs, defines, a, dormant, volcano, as, any, volcano, that, is, not, showing, any, signs, of, unrest, such, as, earthquake, swarms, ground, swelling, or, excessive, noxious, gas, emissions, but, which, shows, signs, that, it, could, yet, become, active, again, many, dormant, volcanoes, have, not, erupted, for, thousands, of, years, but, have, still, shown, signs, that, they, may, be, likely, to, erupt, again, in, the, future, in, an, article, justifying, the, re, classification, of, alaska, s, mount, edgecumbe, volcano, from, dormant, to, active, volcanologists, at, the, alaska, volcano, observatory, pointed, out, that, the, term, dormant, in, reference, to, volcanoes, has, been, deprecated, over, the, past, few, decades, and, that, he, term, dormant, volcano, is, so, little, used, and, undefined, in, modern, volcanology, that, the, encyclopedia, of, volcanoes, 2000, does, not, contain, it, in, the, glossaries, or, index, however, the, usgs, still, widely, employs, the, term, previously, a, volcano, was, often, considered, to, be, extinct, if, there, were, no, written, records, of, its, activity, such, a, generalisation, is, inconsistent, with, observation, and, deeper, study, as, has, occurred, recently, with, the, unexpected, eruption, of, the, chait, n, volcano, in, 2008, modern, volcanic, activity, monitoring, techniques, and, improvements, in, the, modelling, of, the, factors, that, produce, eruptions, have, helped, the, understanding, of, why, volcanoes, may, remain, dormant, for, a, long, time, and, then, become, unexpectedly, active, again, the, potential, for, eruptions, and, their, style, depend, mainly, upon, the, state, of, the, magma, storage, system, under, the, volcano, the, eruption, trigger, mechanism, and, its, timescale, 95, for, example, the, yellowstone, volcano, has, a, repose, recharge, period, of, around, 700, 000, years, and, toba, of, around, 380, 000, years, vesuvius, was, described, by, roman, writers, as, having, been, covered, with, gardens, and, vineyards, before, its, unexpected, eruption, of, 79, ce, which, destroyed, the, towns, of, herculaneum, and, pompeii, accordingly, it, can, sometimes, be, difficult, to, distinguish, between, an, extinct, volcano, and, a, dormant, inactive, one, long, volcano, dormancy, is, known, to, decrease, awareness, 96, pinatubo, was, an, inconspicuous, volcano, unknown, to, most, people, in, the, surrounding, areas, and, initially, not, seismically, monitored, before, its, unanticipated, and, catastrophic, eruption, of, 1991, two, other, examples, of, volcanoes, that, were, once, thought, to, be, extinct, before, springing, back, into, eruptive, activity, were, the, long, dormant, soufri, re, hills, volcano, on, the, island, of, montserrat, thought, to, be, extinct, until, activity, resumed, in, 1995, turning, its, capital, plymouth, into, a, ghost, town, and, fourpeaked, mountain, in, alaska, which, before, its, september, 2006, eruption, had, not, erupted, since, before, 8000, bce, extinct, volcanoes, are, those, that, scientists, consider, unlikely, to, erupt, again, because, the, volcano, no, longer, has, a, magma, supply, examples, of, extinct, volcanoes, are, many, volcanoes, on, the, hawaiian, emperor, seamount, chain, in, the, pacific, ocean, although, some, volcanoes, at, the, eastern, end, of, the, chain, are, active, hohentwiel, in, germany, shiprock, in, new, mexico, us, capulin, in, new, mexico, us, zuidwal, volcano, in, the, netherlands, and, many, volcanoes, in, italy, such, as, monte, vulture, edinburgh, castle, in, scotland, is, located, atop, an, extinct, volcano, which, forms, castle, rock, whether, a, volcano, is, truly, extinct, is, often, difficult, to, determine, since, supervolcano, calderas, can, have, eruptive, lifespans, sometimes, measured, in, millions, of, years, a, caldera, that, has, not, produced, an, eruption, in, tens, of, thousands, of, years, may, be, considered, dormant, instead, of, extinct, an, individual, volcano, in, a, monogenetic, volcanic, field, can, be, extinct, but, that, does, not, mean, a, completely, new, volcano, might, not, erupt, close, by, with, little, or, no, warning, as, its, field, may, have, an, active, magma, supply, the, three, common, popular, classifications, of, volcanoes, can, be, subjective, and, some, volcanoes, thought, to, have, been, extinct, have, erupted, again, to, help, prevent, people, from, falsely, believing, they, are, not, at, risk, when, living, on, or, near, a, volcano, countries, have, adopted, new, classifications, to, describe, the, various, levels, and, stages, of, volcanic, activity, some, alert, systems, use, different, numbers, or, colors, to, designate, the, different, stages, other, systems, use, colors, and, words, some, systems, use, a, combination, of, both, the, decade, volcanoes, are, 16, volcanoes, identified, by, the, international, association, of, volcanology, and, chemistry, of, the, earth, s, interior, iavcei, as, being, worthy, of, particular, study, in, light, of, their, history, of, large, destructive, eruptions, and, proximity, to, populated, areas, they, are, named, decade, volcanoes, because, the, project, was, initiated, as, part, of, the, united, nations, sponsored, international, decade, for, natural, disaster, reduction, the, 1990s, the, 16, current, decade, volcanoes, are, the, deep, earth, carbon, degassing, project, an, initiative, of, the, deep, carbon, observatory, monitors, nine, volcanoes, two, of, which, are, decade, volcanoes, the, focus, of, the, deep, earth, carbon, degassing, project, is, to, use, multi, component, gas, analyzer, system, instruments, to, measure, co, 2, so, 2, ratios, in, real, time, and, in, high, resolution, to, allow, detection, of, the, pre, eruptive, degassing, of, rising, magmas, improving, prediction, of, volcanic, activity, volcanic, eruptions, pose, a, significant, threat, to, human, civilization, however, volcanic, activity, has, also, provided, humans, with, important, resources, there, are, many, different, types, of, volcanic, eruptions, and, associated, activity, phreatic, eruptions, steam, generated, eruptions, explosive, eruptions, of, high, silica, lava, e, g, rhyolite, effusive, eruptions, of, low, silica, lava, e, g, basalt, sector, collapses, pyroclastic, flows, lahars, debris, flows, and, volcanic, gas, emissions, these, can, pose, a, hazard, to, humans, earthquakes, hot, springs, fumaroles, mud, pots, and, geysers, often, accompany, volcanic, activity, volcanic, gases, can, reach, the, stratosphere, where, they, form, sulfuric, acid, aerosols, that, can, reflect, solar, radiation, and, lower, surface, temperatures, significantly, sulfur, dioxide, from, the, eruption, of, huaynaputina, may, have, caused, the, russian, famine, of, 1601, 1603, chemical, reactions, of, sulfate, aerosols, in, the, stratosphere, can, also, damage, the, ozone, layer, and, acids, such, as, hydrogen, chloride, hcl, and, hydrogen, fluoride, hf, can, fall, to, the, ground, as, acid, rain, excessive, fluoride, salts, from, eruptions, have, poisoned, livestock, in, iceland, on, multiple, occasions, 39, 58, explosive, volcanic, eruptions, release, the, greenhouse, gas, carbon, dioxide, and, thus, provide, a, deep, source, of, carbon, for, biogeochemical, cycles, ash, thrown, into, the, air, by, eruptions, can, present, a, hazard, to, aircraft, especially, jet, aircraft, where, the, particles, can, be, melted, by, the, high, operating, temperature, the, melted, particles, then, adhere, to, the, turbine, blades, and, alter, their, shape, disrupting, the, operation, of, the, turbine, this, can, cause, major, disruptions, to, air, travel, a, volcanic, winter, is, thought, to, have, taken, place, around, 70, 000, years, ago, after, the, supereruption, of, lake, toba, on, sumatra, island, in, indonesia, this, may, have, created, a, population, bottleneck, that, affected, the, genetic, inheritance, of, all, humans, today, volcanic, eruptions, may, have, contributed, to, major, extinction, events, such, as, the, end, ordovician, permian, triassic, and, late, devonian, mass, extinctions, the, 1815, eruption, of, mount, tambora, created, global, climate, anomalies, that, became, known, as, the, year, without, a, summer, because, of, the, effect, on, north, american, and, european, weather, the, freezing, winter, of, 1740, 41, which, led, to, widespread, famine, in, northern, europe, may, also, owe, its, origins, to, a, volcanic, eruption, although, volcanic, eruptions, pose, considerable, hazards, to, humans, past, volcanic, activity, has, created, important, economic, resources, tuff, formed, from, volcanic, ash, is, a, relatively, soft, rock, and, it, has, been, used, for, construction, since, ancient, times, the, romans, often, used, tuff, which, is, abundant, in, italy, for, construction, the, rapa, nui, people, used, tuff, to, make, most, of, the, moai, statues, in, easter, island, volcanic, ash, and, weathered, basalt, produce, some, of, the, most, fertile, soil, in, the, world, rich, in, nutrients, such, as, iron, magnesium, potassium, calcium, and, phosphorus, volcanic, activity, is, responsible, for, emplacing, valuable, mineral, resources, such, as, metal, ores, it, is, accompanied, by, high, rates, of, heat, flow, from, earth, s, interior, these, can, be, tapped, as, geothermal, power, tourism, associated, with, volcanoes, is, also, a, worldwide, industry, many, volcanoes, near, human, settlements, are, heavily, monitored, with, the, aim, of, providing, adequate, advance, warnings, of, imminent, eruptions, to, nearby, populations, also, a, better, modern, day, understanding, of, volcanology, has, led, to, some, better, informed, governmental, and, public, responses, to, unanticipated, volcanic, activities, while, the, science, of, volcanology, may, not, yet, be, capable, of, predicting, the, exact, times, and, dates, of, eruptions, far, into, the, future, on, suitably, monitored, volcanoes, the, monitoring, of, ongoing, volcanic, indicators, is, often, capable, of, predicting, imminent, eruptions, with, advance, warnings, minimally, of, hours, and, usually, of, days, prior, to, any, eruptions, the, diversity, of, volcanoes, and, their, complexities, mean, that, eruption, forecasts, for, the, foreseeable, future, will, be, based, on, probability, and, the, application, of, risk, management, even, then, some, eruptions, will, have, no, useful, warning, an, example, of, this, occurred, in, march, 2017, when, a, tourist, group, was, witnessing, a, presumed, to, be, predictable, mount, etna, eruption, and, the, flowing, lava, came, in, contact, with, a, snow, accumulation, causing, a, situational, phreatic, explosion, causing, injury, to, ten, persons, other, types, of, significant, eruptions, are, known, to, give, useful, warnings, of, only, hours, at, the, most, by, seismic, monitoring, the, recent, demonstration, of, a, magma, chamber, with, repose, times, of, tens, of, thousands, of, years, with, potential, for, rapid, recharge, so, potentially, decreasing, warning, times, under, the, youngest, volcano, in, central, europe, does, not, tell, us, if, more, careful, monitoring, will, be, useful, scientists, are, known, to, perceive, risk, with, its, social, elements, differently, from, local, populations, and, those, that, undertake, social, risk, assessments, on, their, behalf, so, that, both, disruptive, false, alarms, and, retrospective, blame, when, disasters, occur, will, continue, to, happen, 1, 3, thus, in, many, cases, while, volcanic, eruptions, may, still, cause, major, property, destruction, the, periodic, large, scale, loss, of, human, life, that, was, once, associated, with, many, volcanic, eruptions, has, recently, been, significantly, reduced, in, areas, where, volcanoes, are, adequately, monitored, this, life, saving, ability, is, derived, via, such, volcanic, activity, monitoring, programs, through, the, greater, abilities, of, local, officials, to, facilitate, timely, evacuations, based, upon, the, greater, modern, day, knowledge, of, volcanism, that, is, now, available, and, upon, improved, communications, technologies, such, as, cell, phones, such, operations, tend, to, provide, enough, time, for, humans, to, escape, at, least, with, their, lives, before, a, pending, eruption, one, example, of, such, a, recent, successful, volcanic, evacuation, was, the, mount, pinatubo, evacuation, of, 1991, this, evacuation, is, believed, to, have, saved, 20, 000, lives, in, the, case, of, mount, etna, a, 2021, review, found, 77, deaths, due, to, eruptions, since, 1536, but, none, since, 1987, citizens, who, may, be, concerned, about, their, own, exposure, to, risk, from, nearby, volcanic, activity, should, familiarize, themselves, with, the, types, of, and, quality, of, volcano, monitoring, and, public, notification, procedures, being, employed, by, governmental, authorities, in, their, areas, earth, s, moon, has, no, large, volcanoes, and, no, current, volcanic, activity, although, recent, evidence, suggests, it, may, still, possess, a, partially, molten, core, however, the, moon, does, have, many, volcanic, features, such, as, maria, the, darker, patches, seen, on, the, moon, rilles, and, domes, the, planet, venus, has, a, surface, that, is, 90, basalt, indicating, that, volcanism, played, a, major, role, in, shaping, its, surface, the, planet, may, have, had, a, major, global, resurfacing, event, about, 500, million, years, ago, from, what, scientists, can, tell, from, the, density, of, impact, craters, on, the, surface, lava, flows, are, widespread, and, forms, of, volcanism, not, present, on, earth, occur, as, well, changes, in, the, planet, s, atmosphere, and, observations, of, lightning, have, been, attributed, to, ongoing, volcanic, eruptions, although, there, is, no, confirmation, of, whether, or, not, venus, is, still, volcanically, active, however, radar, sounding, by, the, magellan, probe, revealed, evidence, for, comparatively, recent, volcanic, activity, at, venus, s, highest, volcano, maat, mons, in, the, form, of, ash, flows, near, the, summit, and, on, the, northern, flank, however, the, interpretation, of, the, flows, as, ash, flows, has, been, questioned, there, are, several, extinct, volcanoes, on, mars, four, of, which, are, vast, shield, volcanoes, far, bigger, than, any, on, earth, they, include, arsia, mons, ascraeus, mons, hecates, tholus, olympus, mons, and, pavonis, mons, these, volcanoes, have, been, extinct, for, many, millions, of, years, but, the, european, mars, express, spacecraft, has, found, evidence, that, volcanic, activity, may, have, occurred, on, mars, in, the, recent, past, as, well, jupiter, s, moon, io, is, the, most, volcanically, active, object, in, the, solar, system, because, of, tidal, interaction, with, jupiter, it, is, covered, with, volcanoes, that, erupt, sulfur, sulfur, dioxide, and, silicate, rock, and, as, a, result, io, is, constantly, being, resurfaced, its, lavas, are, the, hottest, known, anywhere, in, the, solar, system, with, temperatures, exceeding, 1, 800, k, 1, 500, c, in, february, 2001, the, largest, recorded, volcanic, eruptions, in, the, solar, system, occurred, on, io, europa, the, smallest, of, jupiter, s, galilean, moons, also, appears, to, have, an, active, volcanic, system, except, that, its, volcanic, activity, is, entirely, in, the, form, of, water, which, freezes, into, ice, on, the, frigid, surface, this, process, is, known, as, cryovolcanism, and, is, apparently, most, common, on, the, moons, of, the, outer, planets, of, the, solar, system, in, 1989, the, voyager, 2, spacecraft, observed, cryovolcanoes, ice, volcanoes, on, triton, a, moon, of, neptune, and, in, 2005, the, cassini, huygens, probe, photographed, fountains, of, frozen, particles, erupting, from, enceladus, a, moon, of, saturn, the, ejecta, may, be, composed, of, water, liquid, nitrogen, ammonia, dust, or, methane, compounds, cassini, huygens, also, found, evidence, of, a, methane, spewing, cryovolcano, on, the, saturnian, moon, titan, which, is, believed, to, be, a, significant, source, of, the, methane, found, in, its, atmosphere, it, is, theorized, that, cryovolcanism, may, also, be, present, on, the, kuiper, belt, object, quaoar, a, 2010, study, of, the, exoplanet, corot, 7b, which, was, detected, by, transit, in, 2009, suggested, that, tidal, heating, from, the, host, star, very, close, to, the, planet, and, neighboring, planets, could, generate, intense, volcanic, activity, similar, to, that, found, on, io, volcanoes, are, not, distributed, evenly, over, the, earth, s, surface, but, active, ones, with, significant, impact, were, encountered, early, in, human, history, evidenced, by, footprints, of, hominina, found, in, east, african, volcanic, ash, dated, at, 3, 66, million, years, old, 104, the, association, of, volcanoes, with, fire, and, disaster, is, found, in, many, oral, traditions, and, had, religious, and, thus, social, significance, before, the, first, written, record, of, concepts, related, to, volcanoes, examples, are, 1, the, stories, in, the, athabascan, subcultures, about, humans, living, inside, mountains, and, a, woman, who, uses, fire, to, escape, from, a, mountain, 135, 2, pele, s, migration, through, the, hawarian, island, chain, ability, to, destroy, forests, and, manifestations, of, the, god, s, temper, and, 3, the, association, in, javanese, folklore, of, a, king, resident, in, mount, merapi, volcano, and, a, queen, resident, at, a, beach, 50, km, 31, mi, away, on, what, is, now, known, to, be, an, earthquake, fault, that, interacts, with, that, volcano, many, ancient, accounts, ascribe, volcanic, eruptions, to, supernatural, causes, such, as, the, actions, of, gods, or, demigods, the, earliest, known, such, example, is, a, neolithic, goddess, at, atalh, y, k, 203, the, ancient, greek, god, hephaistos, and, the, concepts, of, the, underworld, are, aligned, to, volcanoes, in, that, greek, culture, however, others, proposed, more, natural, but, still, incorrect, causes, of, volcanic, activity, in, the, fifth, century, bc, anaxagoras, proposed, eruptions, were, caused, by, a, great, wind, by, 65, ce, seneca, the, younger, proposed, combustion, as, the, cause, an, idea, also, adopted, by, the, jesuit, athanasius, kircher, 1602, 1680, who, witnessed, eruptions, of, mount, etna, and, stromboli, then, visited, the, crater, of, vesuvius, and, published, his, view, of, an, earth, in, mundus, subterraneus, with, a, central, fire, connected, to, numerous, others, depicting, volcanoes, as, a, type, of, safety, valve, edward, jorden, in, his, work, on, mineral, waters, challenged, this, view, in, 1632, he, proposed, sulfur, fermentation, as, a, heat, source, within, earth, astronomer, johannes, kepler, 1571, 1630, believed, volcanoes, were, ducts, for, earth, s, tears, in, 1650, ren, descartes, proposed, the, core, of, earth, was, incandescent, and, by, 1785, the, works, of, decartes, and, others, were, synthesised, into, geology, by, james, hutton, in, his, writings, about, igneous, intrusions, of, magma, lazzaro, spallanzani, had, demonstrated, by, 1794, that, steam, explosions, could, cause, explosive, eruptions, and, many, geologists, held, this, as, the, universal, cause, of, explosive, eruptions, up, to, the, 1886, eruption, of, mount, tarawera, which, allowed, in, one, event, differentiation, of, the, concurrent, phreatomagmatic, and, hydrothermal, eruptions, from, dry, explosive, eruption, of, as, it, turned, out, a, basalt, dyke, 16, 18, 4, alfred, lacroix, built, upon, his, other, knowledge, with, his, studies, on, the, 1902, eruption, of, mount, pel, e, and, by, 1928, arthur, holmes, work, had, brought, together, the, concepts, of, radioactive, generation, of, heat, earth, s, mantle, structure, partial, decompression, melting, of, magma, and, magma, convection, this, eventually, led, to, the, acceptance, of, plate, tectonics
