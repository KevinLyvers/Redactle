centaurus, s, n, t, r, s, t, r, is, a, bright, constellation, in, the, southern, sky, one, of, the, largest, constellations, centaurus, was, included, among, the, 48, constellations, listed, by, the, 2nd, century, astronomer, ptolemy, and, it, remains, one, of, the, 88, modern, constellations, in, greek, mythology, centaurus, represents, a, centaur, a, creature, that, is, half, human, half, horse, another, constellation, named, after, a, centaur, is, one, from, the, zodiac, sagittarius, notable, stars, include, alpha, centauri, the, nearest, star, system, to, the, solar, system, its, neighbour, in, the, sky, beta, centauri, and, hr, 5171, one, of, the, largest, stars, yet, discovered, the, constellation, also, contains, omega, centauri, the, brightest, globular, cluster, as, visible, from, earth, and, the, largest, identified, in, the, milky, way, possibly, a, remnant, of, a, dwarf, galaxy, centaurus, contains, several, very, bright, stars, its, alpha, and, beta, stars, are, used, as, pointer, stars, to, help, observers, find, the, constellation, crux, centaurus, has, 281, stars, above, magnitude, 6, 5, meaning, that, they, are, visible, to, the, unaided, eye, the, most, of, any, constellation, alpha, centauri, the, closest, star, system, to, the, sun, has, a, high, proper, motion, it, will, be, a, mere, half, degree, from, beta, centauri, in, approximately, 4000, years, alpha, centauri, is, a, triple, star, system, composed, of, a, binary, system, orbited, by, proxima, centauri, currently, the, nearest, star, to, the, sun, traditionally, called, rigil, kentaurus, from, arabic, meaning, foot, of, the, centaur, or, toliman, from, arabic, meaning, two, male, ostriches, the, system, has, an, overall, magnitude, of, 0, 28, and, is, 4, 4, light, years, from, earth, the, primary, and, secondary, are, both, yellow, hued, stars, the, first, is, of, magnitude, 0, 01, and, the, second, 1, 35, proxima, the, tertiary, star, is, a, red, dwarf, of, magnitude, 11, 0, it, appears, almost, 2, degrees, away, from, the, close, pairing, of, alpha, and, has, a, period, of, approximately, one, million, years, also, a, flare, star, proxima, has, minutes, long, outbursts, where, it, brightens, by, over, a, magnitude, the, alpha, couple, revolve, in, 80, year, periodicity, and, will, next, appear, closest, as, seen, from, earth, s, telescopes, in, 2037, and, 2038, together, as, they, appear, to, the, naked, eye, they, present, the, third, brightest, star, in, the, night, sky, one, other, first, magnitude, star, beta, centauri, is, in, the, constellation, in, a, position, beyond, proxima, and, toward, the, narrow, axis, of, crux, thus, with, alpha, forming, a, far, south, limb, of, the, constellation, also, called, hadar, and, agena, it, is, a, double, star, the, primary, is, a, blue, hued, giant, star, of, magnitude, 0, 6, 525, light, years, from, earth, the, secondary, is, of, magnitude, 4, 0, and, has, a, modest, separation, appearing, only, under, intense, magnification, due, to, its, distance, the, northerly, star, theta, centauri, officially, named, menkent, is, an, orange, giant, star, of, magnitude, 2, 06, it, is, the, only, bright, star, of, centaurus, that, is, easily, visible, from, mid, northern, latitudes, the, next, bright, object, is, gamma, centauri, a, binary, star, which, appears, to, the, naked, eye, at, magnitude, 2, 2, the, primary, and, secondary, are, both, blue, white, hued, stars, of, magnitude, 2, 9, their, period, is, 84, years, centaurus, also, has, many, dimmer, double, stars, and, binary, stars, 3, centauri, is, a, double, star, with, a, blue, white, hued, primary, of, magnitude, 4, 5, and, a, secondary, of, magnitude, 6, 0, the, primary, is, 344, light, years, away, centaurus, is, home, to, many, variable, stars, r, centauri, is, a, mira, variable, star, with, a, minimum, magnitude, of, 11, 8, and, a, maximum, magnitude, of, 5, 3, it, is, about, 1, 250, light, years, from, earth, and, has, a, period, of, 18, months, v810, centauri, is, a, semiregular, variable, bpm, 37093, is, a, white, dwarf, star, whose, carbon, atoms, are, thought, to, have, formed, a, crystalline, structure, since, diamond, also, consists, of, carbon, arranged, in, a, crystalline, lattice, though, of, a, different, configuration, scientists, have, nicknamed, this, star, lucy, after, the, beatles, song, lucy, in, the, sky, with, diamonds, pds, 70, v1032, centauri, a, low, mass, t, tauri, star, is, found, in, the, constellation, centaurus, in, july, 2018, astronomers, captured, the, first, conclusive, image, of, a, protoplanetary, disk, containing, a, nascent, exoplanet, named, pds, 70b, centauri, ngc, 5139, despite, being, listed, as, the, constellation, s, omega, star, is, in, fact, a, naked, eye, globular, cluster, 17, 000, light, years, away, with, a, diameter, of, 150, light, years, it, is, the, largest, and, brightest, globular, cluster, in, the, milky, way, at, ten, times, the, size, of, the, next, largest, cluster, it, has, a, magnitude, of, 3, 7, it, is, also, the, most, luminous, globular, cluster, in, the, milky, way, at, over, one, million, solar, luminosities, omega, centauri, is, classified, as, a, shapley, class, viii, cluster, which, means, that, its, center, is, loosely, concentrated, it, is, also, one, of, two, only, globular, clusters, to, be, designated, with, a, bayer, letter, the, globular, cluster, 47, tucanae, xi, tucanae, is, the, only, one, designated, with, a, flamsteed, number, it, contains, several, million, stars, most, of, which, are, yellow, dwarf, stars, but, also, possesses, red, giants, and, blue, white, stars, the, stars, have, an, average, age, of, 12, billion, years, this, has, prompted, suspicion, that, omega, centauri, was, the, core, of, a, dwarf, galaxy, that, had, been, absorbed, by, the, milky, way, omega, centauri, was, determined, to, be, nonstellar, in, 1677, by, the, english, astronomer, edmond, halley, though, it, was, visible, as, a, star, to, the, ancients, its, status, as, a, globular, cluster, was, determined, by, james, dunlop, in, 1827, to, the, unaided, eye, omega, centauri, appears, fuzzy, and, is, obviously, non, circular, it, is, approximately, half, a, degree, in, diameter, the, same, size, as, the, full, moon, centaurus, is, also, home, to, open, clusters, ngc, 3766, is, an, open, cluster, 6, 300, light, years, from, earth, that, is, visible, to, the, unaided, eye, it, contains, approximately, 100, stars, the, brightest, of, which, are, 7th, magnitude, ngc, 5460, is, another, naked, eye, open, cluster, 2, 300, light, years, from, earth, that, has, an, overall, magnitude, of, 6, and, contains, approximately, 40, stars, there, is, one, bright, planetary, nebula, in, centaurus, ngc, 3918, also, known, as, the, blue, planetary, it, has, an, overall, magnitude, of, 8, 0, and, a, central, star, of, magnitude, 11, 0, it, is, 2600, light, years, from, earth, the, blue, planetary, was, discovered, by, john, herschel, and, named, for, its, color, s, similarity, to, uranus, though, the, nebula, is, apparently, three, times, larger, than, the, planet, centaurus, is, rich, in, galaxies, as, well, ngc, 4622, is, a, face, on, spiral, galaxy, located, 200, million, light, years, from, earth, redshift, 0, 0146, its, spiral, arms, wind, in, both, directions, which, makes, it, nearly, impossible, for, astronomers, to, determine, the, rotation, of, the, galaxy, astronomers, theorize, that, a, collision, with, a, smaller, companion, galaxy, near, the, core, of, the, main, galaxy, could, have, led, to, the, unusual, spiral, structure, ngc, 5253, a, peculiar, irregular, galaxy, is, located, near, the, border, with, hydra, and, m83, with, which, it, likely, had, a, close, gravitational, interaction, 1, 2, billion, years, ago, this, may, have, sparked, the, galaxy, s, high, rate, of, star, formation, which, continues, today, and, contributes, to, its, high, surface, brightness, ngc, 5253, includes, a, large, nebula, and, at, least, 12, large, star, clusters, in, the, eyepiece, it, is, a, small, galaxy, of, magnitude, 10, with, dimensions, of, 5, arcminutes, by, 2, arcminutes, and, a, bright, nucleus, ngc, 4945, is, a, spiral, galaxy, seen, edge, on, from, earth, 13, million, light, years, away, it, is, visible, with, any, amateur, telescope, as, well, as, binoculars, under, good, conditions, it, has, been, described, as, shaped, like, a, candle, flame, being, long, and, thin, 16, by, 3, in, the, eyepiece, of, a, large, telescope, its, southeastern, dust, lane, becomes, visible, another, galaxy, is, ngc, 5102, found, by, star, hopping, from, iota, centauri, in, the, eyepiece, it, appears, as, an, elliptical, object, 9, arcminutes, by, 2, 5, arcminutes, tilted, on, a, southwest, northeast, axis, one, of, the, closest, active, galaxies, to, earth, is, the, centaurus, a, galaxy, ngc, 5128, at, 11, million, light, years, away, redshift, 0, 00183, it, has, a, supermassive, black, hole, at, its, core, which, expels, massive, jets, of, matter, that, emit, radio, waves, due, to, synchrotron, radiation, astronomers, posit, that, its, dust, lanes, not, common, in, elliptical, galaxies, are, due, to, a, previous, merger, with, another, galaxy, probably, a, spiral, galaxy, ngc, 5128, appears, in, the, optical, spectrum, as, a, fairly, large, elliptical, galaxy, with, a, prominent, dust, lane, its, overall, magnitude, is, 7, 0, and, it, has, been, seen, under, perfect, conditions, with, the, naked, eye, making, it, one, of, the, most, distant, objects, visible, to, the, unaided, observer, in, equatorial, and, southern, latitudes, it, is, easily, found, by, star, hopping, from, omega, centauri, in, small, telescopes, the, dust, lane, is, not, visible, it, begins, to, appear, with, about, 4, inches, of, aperture, under, good, conditions, in, large, amateur, instruments, above, about, 12, inches, in, aperture, the, dust, lane, s, west, northwest, to, east, southeast, direction, is, easily, discerned, another, dim, dust, lane, on, the, east, side, of, the, 12, arcminute, by, 15, arcminute, galaxy, is, also, visible, eso, 270, 17, also, called, the, fourcade, figueroa, object, is, a, low, surface, brightness, object, believed, to, be, the, remnants, of, a, galaxy, it, does, not, have, a, core, and, is, very, difficult, to, observe, with, an, amateur, telescope, it, measures, 7, arcminutes, by, 1, arcminute, it, likely, originated, as, a, spiral, galaxy, and, underwent, a, catastrophic, gravitational, interaction, with, centaurus, a, around, 500, million, years, ago, stopping, its, rotation, and, destroying, its, structure, ngc, 4650a, is, a, polar, ring, galaxy, 136, million, light, years, from, earth, redshift, 0, 01, it, has, a, central, core, made, of, older, stars, that, resembles, an, elliptical, galaxy, and, an, outer, ring, of, young, stars, that, orbits, around, the, core, the, plane, of, the, outer, ring, is, distorted, which, suggests, that, ngc, 4650a, is, the, result, of, a, galaxy, collision, about, a, billion, years, ago, this, galaxy, has, also, been, cited, in, studies, of, dark, matter, because, the, stars, in, the, outer, ring, orbit, too, quickly, for, their, collective, mass, this, suggests, that, the, galaxy, is, surrounded, by, a, dark, matter, halo, which, provides, the, necessary, mass, one, of, the, closest, galaxy, clusters, to, earth, is, the, centaurus, cluster, at, c, 160, million, light, years, away, having, redshift, 0, 0114, it, has, a, cooler, denser, central, region, of, gas, and, a, hotter, more, diffuse, outer, region, the, intracluster, medium, in, the, centaurus, cluster, has, a, high, concentration, of, metals, elements, heavier, than, helium, due, to, a, large, number, of, supernovae, this, cluster, also, possesses, a, plume, of, gas, whose, origin, is, unknown, while, centaurus, now, has, a, high, southern, latitude, at, the, dawn, of, civilization, it, was, an, equatorial, constellation, precession, has, been, slowly, shifting, it, southward, for, millennia, and, it, is, now, close, to, its, maximal, southern, declination, in, a, little, over, 7000, years, it, will, be, at, maximum, visibility, for, those, in, the, northern, hemisphere, visible, at, times, in, the, year, up, to, quite, a, high, northern, latitude, the, figure, of, centaurus, can, be, traced, back, to, a, babylonian, constellation, known, as, the, bison, man, mul, gud, alim, this, being, was, depicted, in, two, major, forms, firstly, as, a, 4, legged, bison, with, a, human, head, and, secondly, as, a, being, with, a, man, s, head, and, torso, attached, to, the, rear, legs, and, tail, of, a, bull, or, bison, it, has, been, closely, associated, with, the, sun, god, utu, shamash, from, very, early, times, the, greeks, depicted, the, constellation, as, a, centaur, and, gave, it, its, current, name, it, was, mentioned, by, eudoxus, in, the, 4th, century, bc, and, aratus, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, in, the, 2nd, century, ad, claudius, ptolemy, catalogued, 37, stars, in, centaurus, including, alpha, centauri, large, as, it, is, now, in, earlier, times, it, was, even, larger, as, the, constellation, lupus, was, treated, as, an, asterism, within, centaurus, portrayed, in, illustrations, as, an, unspecified, animal, either, in, the, centaur, s, grasp, or, impaled, on, its, spear, the, southern, cross, which, is, now, regarded, as, a, separate, constellation, was, treated, by, the, ancients, as, a, mere, asterism, formed, of, the, stars, composing, the, centaur, s, legs, additionally, what, is, now, the, minor, constellation, circinus, was, treated, as, undefined, stars, under, the, centaur, s, front, hooves, according, to, the, roman, poet, ovid, fasti, v, 379, the, constellation, honors, the, centaur, chiron, who, was, tutor, to, many, of, the, earlier, greek, heroes, including, heracles, hercules, theseus, and, jason, the, leader, of, the, argonauts, it, is, not, to, be, confused, with, the, more, warlike, centaur, represented, by, the, zodiacal, constellation, sagittarius, the, legend, associated, with, chiron, says, that, he, was, accidentally, poisoned, with, an, arrow, shot, by, hercules, and, was, subsequently, placed, in, the, heavens, in, chinese, astronomy, the, stars, of, centaurus, are, found, in, three, areas, the, azure, dragon, of, the, east, d, ng, f, ng, q, ng, l, ng, the, vermillion, bird, of, the, south, n, n, f, ng, zh, qu, and, the, southern, asterisms, j, nn, nj, x, ng, u, not, all, of, the, stars, of, centaurus, can, be, seen, from, china, and, the, unseen, stars, were, classified, among, the, southern, asterisms, by, xu, guangqi, based, on, his, study, of, western, star, charts, however, most, of, the, brightest, stars, of, centaurus, including, centauri, centauri, or, menkent, centauri, and, centauri, can, be, seen, in, the, chinese, sky, some, polynesian, peoples, considered, the, stars, of, centaurus, to, be, a, constellation, as, well, on, pukapuka, centaurus, had, two, names, na, mata, o, te, tokolua, and, na, lua, mata, o, wua, ma, velo, in, tonga, the, constellation, was, called, by, four, names, o, nga, tangata, tautanga, ufi, mamangi, halahu, and, mau, kuo, mau, alpha, and, beta, centauri, were, not, named, specifically, by, the, people, of, pukapuka, or, tonga, but, they, were, named, by, the, people, of, hawaii, and, the, tuamotus, in, hawaii, the, name, for, alpha, centauri, was, either, melemele, or, ka, maile, hope, and, the, name, for, beta, centauri, was, either, polapola, or, ka, maile, mua, in, the, tuamotu, islands, alpha, was, called, na, kuhi, and, beta, was, called, tere, the, pointer, centauri, and, centauri, is, one, of, the, asterisms, used, by, bugis, sailors, for, navigation, called, binto, ng, balu, meaning, the, widowed, before, marriage, it, is, also, called, binto, ng, sallatang, meaning, southern, star, two, united, states, navy, ships, uss, centaurus, aka, 17, and, uss, centaurus, ak, 264, were, named, after, centaurus, the, constellation
