the, andromeda, galaxy, is, a, barred, spiral, galaxy, and, is, the, nearest, major, galaxy, to, the, milky, way, it, was, originally, named, the, andromeda, nebula, and, is, cataloged, as, messier, 31, m31, and, ngc, 224, andromeda, has, a, d, 25, isophotal, diameter, of, about, 46, 56, kiloparsecs, 152, 000, light, years, and, is, approximately, 765, kpc, 2, 5, million, light, years, from, earth, the, galaxy, s, name, stems, from, the, area, of, earth, s, sky, in, which, it, appears, the, constellation, of, andromeda, which, itself, is, named, after, the, princess, who, was, the, wife, of, perseus, in, greek, mythology, the, virial, mass, of, the, andromeda, galaxy, is, of, the, same, order, of, magnitude, as, that, of, the, milky, way, at, 1, trillion, solar, masses, 2, 0, 10, 42, kilograms, the, mass, of, either, galaxy, is, difficult, to, estimate, with, any, accuracy, but, it, was, long, thought, that, the, andromeda, galaxy, was, more, massive, than, the, milky, way, by, a, margin, of, some, 25, to, 50, however, this, has, been, called, into, question, by, early, 21st, century, studies, indicating, a, possibly, lower, mass, for, the, andromeda, galaxy, and, a, higher, mass, for, the, milky, way, the, andromeda, galaxy, has, a, diameter, of, about, 46, 56, kpc, 152, 000, ly, making, it, the, largest, member, of, the, local, group, of, galaxies, in, terms, of, extension, the, milky, way, and, andromeda, galaxies, are, expected, to, collide, with, each, other, in, around, 4, 5, billion, years, merging, to, potentially, form, a, giant, elliptical, galaxy, or, a, large, lenticular, galaxy, with, an, apparent, magnitude, of, 3, 4, the, andromeda, galaxy, is, among, the, brightest, of, the, messier, objects, and, is, visible, to, the, naked, eye, from, earth, on, moonless, nights, even, when, viewed, from, areas, with, moderate, light, pollution, the, andromeda, galaxy, is, visible, to, the, naked, eye, in, dark, skies, around, the, year, 964, ce, the, persian, astronomer, abd, al, rahman, al, sufi, described, the, andromeda, galaxy, in, his, book, of, fixed, stars, as, a, nebulous, smear, or, small, cloud, star, charts, of, that, period, labeled, it, as, the, little, cloud, in, 1612, the, german, astronomer, simon, marius, gave, an, early, description, of, the, andromeda, galaxy, based, on, telescopic, observations, pierre, louis, maupertuis, conjectured, in, 1745, that, the, blurry, spot, was, an, island, universe, charles, messier, cataloged, andromeda, as, object, m31, in, 1764, and, incorrectly, credited, marius, as, the, discoverer, despite, its, being, visible, to, the, naked, eye, in, 1785, the, astronomer, william, herschel, noted, a, faint, reddish, hue, in, the, core, region, of, andromeda, he, believed, andromeda, to, be, the, nearest, of, all, the, great, nebulae, and, based, on, the, color, and, magnitude, of, the, nebula, he, incorrectly, guessed, that, it, was, no, more, than, 2, 000, times, the, distance, of, sirius, or, roughly, 18, 000, ly, 5, 5, kpc, in, 1850, william, parsons, 3rd, earl, of, rosse, made, a, drawing, of, andromeda, s, spiral, structure, in, 1864, william, huggins, noted, that, the, spectrum, of, andromeda, differed, from, that, of, a, gaseous, nebula, the, spectrum, of, andromeda, displays, a, continuum, of, frequencies, superimposed, with, dark, absorption, lines, that, help, identify, the, chemical, composition, of, an, object, andromeda, s, spectrum, is, very, similar, to, the, spectra, of, individual, stars, and, from, this, it, was, deduced, that, andromeda, has, a, stellar, nature, in, 1885, a, supernova, known, as, s, andromedae, was, seen, in, andromeda, the, first, and, so, far, only, one, observed, in, that, galaxy, at, the, time, it, was, called, nova, 1885, the, difference, between, novae, in, the, modern, sense, and, supernovae, was, not, yet, known, andromeda, was, considered, to, be, a, nearby, object, and, it, was, not, realized, that, the, nova, was, much, brighter, than, ordinary, novae, in, 1888, isaac, roberts, took, one, of, the, first, photographs, of, andromeda, which, was, still, commonly, thought, to, be, a, nebula, within, our, galaxy, roberts, mistook, andromeda, and, similar, spiral, nebulae, as, star, systems, being, formed, in, 1912, vesto, slipher, used, spectroscopy, to, measure, the, radial, velocity, of, andromeda, with, respect, to, the, solar, system, the, largest, velocity, yet, measured, at, 300, km, s, 190, mi, s, as, early, as, 1755, the, german, philosopher, immanuel, kant, proposed, the, hypothesis, that, the, milky, way, is, only, one, of, many, galaxies, in, his, book, universal, natural, history, and, theory, of, the, heavens, arguing, that, a, structure, like, the, milky, way, would, look, like, a, circular, nebula, viewed, from, above, and, like, an, ellipsoid, if, viewed, from, an, angle, he, concluded, that, the, observed, elliptical, nebulae, like, andromeda, which, could, not, be, explained, otherwise, at, the, time, were, indeed, galaxies, similar, to, the, milky, way, not, nebulae, as, andromeda, was, commonly, believed, to, be, in, 1917, heber, curtis, observed, a, nova, within, andromeda, after, searching, the, photographic, record, 11, more, novae, were, discovered, curtis, noticed, that, these, novae, were, on, average, 10, magnitudes, fainter, than, those, that, occurred, elsewhere, in, the, sky, as, a, result, he, was, able, to, come, up, with, a, distance, estimate, of, 500, 000, ly, 3, 2, 10, 10, au, although, this, estimate, is, about, fivefold, lower, than, the, best, estimates, now, available, it, was, the, first, known, estimate, of, the, distance, to, andromeda, that, was, correct, to, within, an, order, of, magnitude, i, e, to, within, a, factor, of, ten, of, the, current, estimates, which, place, the, distance, around, 2, 5, million, light, years, curtis, became, a, proponent, of, the, so, called, island, universes, hypothesis, that, spiral, nebulae, were, actually, independent, galaxies, in, 1920, the, great, debate, between, harlow, shapley, and, curtis, took, place, concerning, the, nature, of, the, milky, way, spiral, nebulae, and, the, dimensions, of, the, universe, to, support, his, claim, that, the, great, andromeda, nebula, is, in, fact, an, external, galaxy, curtis, also, noted, the, appearance, of, dark, lanes, within, andromeda, that, resembled, the, dust, clouds, in, our, own, galaxy, as, well, as, historical, observations, of, the, andromeda, galaxy, s, significant, doppler, shift, in, 1922, ernst, pik, presented, a, method, to, estimate, the, distance, of, andromeda, using, the, measured, velocities, of, its, stars, his, result, placed, the, andromeda, nebula, far, outside, our, galaxy, at, a, distance, of, about, 450, kpc, 1, 500, kly, edwin, hubble, settled, the, debate, in, 1925, when, he, identified, extragalactic, cepheid, variable, stars, for, the, first, time, on, astronomical, photos, of, andromeda, these, were, made, using, the, 100, inch, 2, 5, m, hooker, telescope, and, they, enabled, the, distance, of, the, great, andromeda, nebula, to, be, determined, his, measurement, demonstrated, conclusively, that, this, feature, was, not, a, cluster, of, stars, and, gas, within, our, own, galaxy, but, an, entirely, separate, galaxy, located, a, significant, distance, from, the, milky, way, in, 1943, walter, baade, was, the, first, person, to, resolve, stars, in, the, central, region, of, the, andromeda, galaxy, baade, identified, two, distinct, populations, of, stars, based, on, their, metallicity, naming, the, young, high, velocity, stars, in, the, disk, type, i, and, the, older, red, stars, in, the, bulge, type, ii, this, nomenclature, was, subsequently, adopted, for, stars, within, the, milky, way, and, elsewhere, the, existence, of, two, distinct, populations, had, been, noted, earlier, by, jan, oort, baade, also, discovered, that, there, were, two, types, of, cepheid, variable, stars, which, resulted, in, doubling, the, distance, estimate, to, andromeda, as, well, as, the, remainder, of, the, universe, in, 1950, radio, emissions, from, the, andromeda, galaxy, were, detected, by, robert, hanbury, brown, and, cyril, hazard, at, the, jodrell, bank, observatory, the, first, radio, maps, of, the, galaxy, were, made, in, the, 1950s, by, john, baldwin, and, collaborators, at, the, cambridge, radio, astronomy, group, the, core, of, the, andromeda, galaxy, is, called, 2c, 56, in, the, 2c, radio, astronomy, catalog, in, 2009, an, occurrence, of, microlensing, a, phenomenon, caused, by, the, deflection, of, light, by, a, massive, object, may, have, led, to, the, first, discovery, of, a, planet, in, the, andromeda, galaxy, in, 2020, observations, of, linearly, polarized, radio, emission, with, the, westerbork, synthesis, radio, telescope, the, effelsberg, 100, m, radio, telescope, and, the, very, large, array, revealed, ordered, magnetic, fields, aligned, along, the, 10, kpc, ring, of, gas, and, star, formation, the, estimated, distance, of, the, andromeda, galaxy, from, our, own, was, doubled, in, 1953, when, it, was, discovered, that, there, is, a, second, dimmer, type, of, cepheid, variable, star, in, the, 1990s, measurements, of, both, standard, red, giants, as, well, as, red, clump, stars, from, the, hipparcos, satellite, measurements, were, used, to, calibrate, the, cepheid, distances, a, major, merger, occurred, 2, to, 3, billion, years, ago, at, the, andromeda, location, involving, two, galaxies, with, a, mass, ratio, of, approximately, 4, the, discovery, of, a, recent, merger, in, the, andromeda, galaxy, was, first, based, on, interpreting, its, anomalous, age, velocity, dispersion, relation, as, well, as, the, fact, that, 2, billion, years, ago, star, formation, throughout, andromeda, s, disk, was, much, more, active, than, today, modeling, of, this, violent, collision, shows, that, it, has, formed, most, of, the, galaxy, s, metal, rich, galactic, halo, including, the, giant, stream, and, also, the, extended, thick, disk, the, young, age, thin, disk, and, the, static, 10, kpc, ring, during, this, epoch, its, rate, of, star, formation, would, have, been, very, high, to, the, point, of, becoming, a, luminous, infrared, galaxy, for, roughly, 100, million, years, modeling, also, recovers, the, bulge, profile, the, large, bar, and, the, overall, halo, density, profile, andromeda, and, the, triangulum, galaxy, m33, might, have, had, a, very, close, passage, 2, 4, billion, years, ago, but, it, seems, unlikely, from, the, last, measurements, from, the, hubble, space, telescope, at, least, four, distinct, techniques, have, been, used, to, estimate, distances, from, earth, to, the, andromeda, galaxy, in, 2003, using, the, infrared, surface, brightness, fluctuations, i, sbf, and, adjusting, for, the, new, period, luminosity, value, and, a, metallicity, correction, of, 0, 2, mag, dex, 1, in, o, h, an, estimate, of, 2, 57, 0, 06, million, light, years, 1, 625, 10, 11, 3, 8, 10, 9, astronomical, units, was, derived, a, 2004, cepheid, variable, method, estimated, the, distance, to, be, 2, 51, 0, 13, million, light, years, 770, 40, kpc, in, 2005, an, eclipsing, binary, star, was, discovered, in, the, andromeda, galaxy, the, binary, is, made, up, of, two, hot, blue, stars, of, types, o, and, b, by, studying, the, eclipses, of, the, stars, astronomers, were, able, to, measure, their, sizes, knowing, the, sizes, and, temperatures, of, the, stars, they, were, able, to, measure, their, absolute, magnitude, when, the, visual, and, absolute, magnitudes, are, known, the, distance, to, the, star, can, be, calculated, the, stars, lie, at, a, distance, of, 2, 52, 10, 6, 0, 14, 10, 6, ly, 1, 594, 10, 11, 8, 9, 10, 9, au, and, the, whole, andromeda, galaxy, at, about, 2, 5, 10, 6, ly, 1, 6, 10, 11, au, this, new, value, is, in, excellent, agreement, with, the, previous, independent, cepheid, based, distance, value, the, trgb, method, was, also, used, in, 2005, giving, a, distance, of, 2, 56, 10, 6, 0, 08, 10, 6, ly, 1, 619, 10, 11, 5, 1, 10, 9, au, averaged, together, these, distance, estimates, give, a, value, of, 2, 54, 10, 6, 0, 11, 10, 6, ly, 1, 606, 10, 11, 7, 0, 10, 9, au, until, 2018, mass, estimates, for, the, andromeda, galaxy, s, halo, including, dark, matter, gave, a, value, of, approximately, 1, 5, 10, 12, m, compared, to, 8, 10, 11, m, for, the, milky, way, this, contradicted, even, earlier, measurements, that, seemed, to, indicate, that, the, andromeda, galaxy, and, milky, way, are, almost, equal, in, mass, in, 2018, the, earlier, measurements, for, equality, of, mass, were, re, established, by, radio, results, as, approximately, 8, 10, 11, m, in, 2006, the, andromeda, galaxy, s, spheroid, was, determined, to, have, a, higher, stellar, density, than, that, of, the, milky, way, and, its, galactic, stellar, disk, was, estimated, at, twice, the, diameter, of, that, of, the, milky, way, the, total, mass, of, the, andromeda, galaxy, is, estimated, to, be, between, 8, 10, 11, m, and, 1, 1, 10, 12, m, the, stellar, mass, of, m31, is, 10, 15, 10, 10, m, with, 30, of, that, mass, in, the, central, bulge, 56, in, the, disk, and, the, remaining, 14, in, the, stellar, halo, the, radio, results, similar, mass, to, the, milky, way, galaxy, should, be, taken, as, likeliest, as, of, 2018, although, clearly, this, matter, is, still, under, active, investigation, by, several, research, groups, worldwide, as, of, 2019, current, calculations, based, on, escape, velocity, and, dynamical, mass, measurements, put, the, andromeda, galaxy, at, 0, 8, 10, 12, m, which, is, only, half, of, the, milky, way, s, newer, mass, calculated, in, 2019, at, 1, 5, 10, 12, m, in, addition, to, stars, the, andromeda, galaxy, s, interstellar, medium, contains, at, least, 7, 2, 10, 9, m, in, the, form, of, neutral, hydrogen, at, least, 3, 4, 10, 8, m, as, molecular, hydrogen, within, its, innermost, 10, kiloparsecs, and, 5, 4, 10, 7, m, of, dust, the, andromeda, galaxy, is, surrounded, by, a, massive, halo, of, hot, gas, that, is, estimated, to, contain, half, the, mass, of, the, stars, in, the, galaxy, the, nearly, invisible, halo, stretches, about, a, million, light, years, from, its, host, galaxy, halfway, to, our, milky, way, galaxy, simulations, of, galaxies, indicate, the, halo, formed, at, the, same, time, as, the, andromeda, galaxy, the, halo, is, enriched, in, elements, heavier, than, hydrogen, and, helium, formed, from, supernovae, and, its, properties, are, those, expected, for, a, galaxy, that, lies, in, the, green, valley, of, the, galaxy, color, magnitude, diagram, see, below, supernovae, erupt, in, the, andromeda, galaxy, s, star, filled, disk, and, eject, these, heavier, elements, into, space, over, the, andromeda, galaxy, s, lifetime, nearly, half, of, the, heavy, elements, made, by, its, stars, have, been, ejected, far, beyond, the, galaxy, s, 200, 000, light, year, diameter, stellar, disk, compared, to, the, milky, way, the, andromeda, galaxy, appears, to, have, predominantly, older, stars, with, ages, 7, 10, 9, years, the, estimated, luminosity, of, the, andromeda, galaxy, 2, 6, 10, 10, l, is, about, 25, higher, than, that, of, our, own, galaxy, however, the, galaxy, has, a, high, inclination, as, seen, from, earth, and, its, interstellar, dust, absorbs, an, unknown, amount, of, light, so, it, is, difficult, to, estimate, its, actual, brightness, and, other, authors, have, given, other, values, for, the, luminosity, of, the, andromeda, galaxy, some, authors, even, propose, it, is, the, second, brightest, galaxy, within, a, radius, of, 10, megaparsecs, of, the, milky, way, after, the, sombrero, galaxy, with, an, absolute, magnitude, of, around, 22, 21, or, close, an, estimation, done, with, the, help, of, spitzer, space, telescope, published, in, 2010, suggests, an, absolute, magnitude, in, the, blue, of, 20, 89, that, with, a, color, index, of, 0, 63, translates, to, an, absolute, visual, magnitude, of, 21, 52, compared, to, 20, 9, for, the, milky, way, and, a, total, luminosity, in, that, wavelength, of, 3, 64, 10, 10, l, the, rate, of, star, formation, in, the, milky, way, is, much, higher, with, the, andromeda, galaxy, producing, only, about, one, solar, mass, per, year, compared, to, 3, 5, solar, masses, for, the, milky, way, the, rate, of, novae, in, the, milky, way, is, also, double, that, of, the, andromeda, galaxy, this, suggests, that, the, latter, once, experienced, a, great, star, formation, phase, but, is, now, in, a, relative, state, of, quiescence, whereas, the, milky, way, is, experiencing, more, active, star, formation, should, this, continue, the, luminosity, of, the, milky, way, may, eventually, overtake, that, of, the, andromeda, galaxy, according, to, recent, studies, the, andromeda, galaxy, lies, in, what, is, known, in, the, galaxy, color, magnitude, diagram, as, the, green, valley, a, region, populated, by, galaxies, like, the, milky, way, in, transition, from, the, blue, cloud, galaxies, actively, forming, new, stars, to, the, red, sequence, galaxies, that, lack, star, formation, star, formation, activity, in, green, valley, galaxies, is, slowing, as, they, run, out, of, star, forming, gas, in, the, interstellar, medium, in, simulated, galaxies, with, similar, properties, to, the, andromeda, galaxy, star, formation, is, expected, to, extinguish, within, about, five, billion, years, even, accounting, for, the, expected, short, term, increase, in, the, rate, of, star, formation, due, to, the, collision, between, the, andromeda, galaxy, and, the, milky, way, based, on, its, appearance, in, visible, light, the, andromeda, galaxy, is, classified, as, an, sa, s, b, galaxy, in, the, de, vaucouleurs, sandage, extended, classification, system, of, spiral, galaxies, however, infrared, data, from, the, 2mass, survey, and, the, spitzer, space, telescope, showed, that, andromeda, is, actually, a, barred, spiral, galaxy, like, the, milky, way, with, andromeda, s, bar, major, axis, oriented, 55, degrees, anti, clockwise, from, the, disc, major, axis, there, are, various, methods, used, in, astronomy, in, defining, the, size, of, a, galaxy, and, each, method, can, yield, different, results, concerning, one, another, the, most, commonly, employed, is, the, d, 25, standard, the, isophote, where, the, photometric, brightness, of, a, galaxy, in, the, b, band, 445, nm, wavelength, of, light, in, the, blue, part, of, the, visible, spectrum, reaches, 25, mag, arcsec, 2, the, third, reference, catalogue, of, bright, galaxies, rc3, used, this, standard, for, andromeda, in, 1991, yielding, an, isophotal, diameter, of, 46, 56, kiloparsecs, 152, 000, light, years, at, a, distance, of, 2, 5, million, light, years, an, earlier, estimate, from, 1981, gave, a, diameter, for, andromeda, at, 54, kiloparsecs, 176, 000, light, years, a, study, in, 2005, by, the, keck, telescopes, shows, the, existence, of, a, tenuous, sprinkle, of, stars, or, galactic, halo, extending, outward, from, the, galaxy, the, stars, in, this, halo, behave, differently, from, the, ones, in, andromeda, s, main, galactic, disc, where, they, show, rather, disorganized, orbital, motions, as, opposed, to, the, stars, in, the, main, disc, having, more, orderly, orbits, and, uniform, velocities, of, 200, km, s, this, diffuse, halo, extends, outwards, away, from, andromeda, s, main, disc, with, the, diameter, of, 67, 45, kiloparsecs, 220, 000, light, years, the, galaxy, is, inclined, an, estimated, 77, relative, to, earth, where, an, angle, of, 90, would, be, edge, on, analysis, of, the, cross, sectional, shape, of, the, galaxy, appears, to, demonstrate, a, pronounced, s, shaped, warp, rather, than, just, a, flat, disk, a, possible, cause, of, such, a, warp, could, be, gravitational, interaction, with, the, satellite, galaxies, near, the, andromeda, galaxy, the, galaxy, m33, could, be, responsible, for, some, warp, in, andromeda, s, arms, though, more, precise, distances, and, radial, velocities, are, required, spectroscopic, studies, have, provided, detailed, measurements, of, the, rotational, velocity, of, the, andromeda, galaxy, as, a, function, of, radial, distance, from, the, core, the, rotational, velocity, has, a, maximum, value, of, 225, km, s, 140, mi, s, at, 1, 300, ly, 82, 000, 000, au, from, the, core, and, it, has, its, minimum, possibly, as, low, as, 50, km, s, 31, mi, s, at, 7, 000, ly, 440, 000, 000, au, from, the, core, further, out, rotational, velocity, rises, out, to, a, radius, of, 33, 000, ly, 2, 1, 10, 9, au, where, it, reaches, a, peak, of, 250, km, s, 160, mi, s, the, velocities, slowly, decline, beyond, that, distance, dropping, to, around, 200, km, s, 120, mi, s, at, 80, 000, ly, 5, 1, 10, 9, au, these, velocity, measurements, imply, a, concentrated, mass, of, about, 6, 10, 9, m, in, the, nucleus, the, total, mass, of, the, galaxy, increases, linearly, out, to, 45, 000, ly, 2, 8, 10, 9, au, then, more, slowly, beyond, that, radius, the, spiral, arms, of, the, andromeda, galaxy, are, outlined, by, a, series, of, hii, regions, first, studied, in, great, detail, by, walter, baade, and, described, by, him, as, resembling, beads, on, a, string, his, studies, show, two, spiral, arms, that, appear, to, be, tightly, wound, although, they, are, more, widely, spaced, than, in, our, galaxy, his, descriptions, of, the, spiral, structure, as, each, arm, crosses, the, major, axis, of, the, andromeda, galaxy, are, as, follows, pp1062, pp92, since, the, andromeda, galaxy, is, seen, close, to, edge, on, it, is, difficult, to, study, its, spiral, structure, rectified, images, of, the, galaxy, seem, to, show, a, fairly, normal, spiral, galaxy, exhibiting, two, continuous, trailing, arms, that, are, separated, from, each, other, by, a, minimum, of, about, 13, 000, ly, 820, 000, 000, au, and, that, can, be, followed, outward, from, a, distance, of, roughly, 1, 600, ly, 100, 000, 000, au, from, the, core, alternative, spiral, structures, have, been, proposed, such, as, a, single, spiral, arm, or, a, flocculent, pattern, of, long, filamentary, and, thick, spiral, arms, the, most, likely, cause, of, the, distortions, of, the, spiral, pattern, is, thought, to, be, interaction, with, galaxy, satellites, m32, and, m110, this, can, be, seen, by, the, displacement, of, the, neutral, hydrogen, clouds, from, the, stars, in, 1998, images, from, the, european, space, agency, s, infrared, space, observatory, demonstrated, that, the, overall, form, of, the, andromeda, galaxy, may, be, transitioning, into, a, ring, galaxy, the, gas, and, dust, within, the, galaxy, are, generally, formed, into, several, overlapping, rings, with, a, particularly, prominent, ring, formed, at, a, radius, of, 32, 000, ly, 9, 8, kpc, from, the, core, nicknamed, by, some, astronomers, the, ring, of, fire, this, ring, is, hidden, from, visible, light, images, of, the, galaxy, because, it, is, composed, primarily, of, cold, dust, and, most, of, the, star, formation, that, is, taking, place, in, the, andromeda, galaxy, is, concentrated, there, later, studies, with, the, help, of, the, spitzer, space, telescope, showed, how, the, andromeda, galaxy, s, spiral, structure, in, the, infrared, appears, to, be, composed, of, two, spiral, arms, that, emerge, from, a, central, bar, and, continue, beyond, the, large, ring, mentioned, above, those, arms, however, are, not, continuous, and, have, a, segmented, structure, close, examination, of, the, inner, region, of, the, andromeda, galaxy, with, the, same, telescope, also, showed, a, smaller, dust, ring, that, is, believed, to, have, been, caused, by, the, interaction, with, m32, more, than, 200, million, years, ago, simulations, show, that, the, smaller, galaxy, passed, through, the, disk, of, the, andromeda, galaxy, along, the, latter, s, polar, axis, this, collision, stripped, more, than, half, the, mass, from, the, smaller, m32, and, created, the, ring, structures, in, andromeda, it, is, the, co, existence, of, the, long, known, large, ring, like, feature, in, the, gas, of, messier, 31, together, with, this, newly, discovered, inner, ring, like, structure, offset, from, the, barycenter, that, suggested, a, nearly, head, on, collision, with, the, satellite, m32, a, milder, version, of, the, cartwheel, encounter, studies, of, the, extended, halo, of, the, andromeda, galaxy, show, that, it, is, roughly, comparable, to, that, of, the, milky, way, with, stars, in, the, halo, being, generally, metal, poor, and, increasingly, so, with, greater, distance, this, evidence, indicates, that, the, two, galaxies, have, followed, similar, evolutionary, paths, they, are, likely, to, have, accreted, and, assimilated, about, 100, 200, low, mass, galaxies, during, the, past, 12, billion, years, the, stars, in, the, extended, halos, of, the, andromeda, galaxy, and, the, milky, way, may, extend, nearly, one, third, the, distance, separating, the, two, galaxies, the, andromeda, galaxy, is, known, to, harbor, a, dense, and, compact, star, cluster, at, its, very, center, similar, to, our, own, galaxy, a, large, telescope, creates, a, visual, impression, of, a, star, embedded, in, the, more, diffuse, surrounding, bulge, in, 1991, the, hubble, space, telescope, was, used, to, image, the, andromeda, galaxy, s, inner, nucleus, the, nucleus, consists, of, two, concentrations, separated, by, 1, 5, pc, 4, 9, ly, the, brighter, concentration, designated, as, p1, is, offset, from, the, center, of, the, galaxy, the, dimmer, concentration, p2, falls, at, the, true, center, of, the, galaxy, and, contains, an, embedded, star, cluster, called, p3, containing, many, uv, bright, a, stars, and, the, supermassive, black, hole, called, m31, the, black, hole, is, classified, as, a, low, luminosity, agn, llagn, and, it, was, detected, only, in, radio, wavelengths, and, in, x, rays, it, was, quiescent, in, 2004, 2005, but, it, was, highly, variable, in, 2006, 2007, the, mass, of, m31, was, measured, at, 3, 5, 10, 7, m, in, 1993, and, at, 1, 1, 2, 3, 10, 8, m, in, 2005, the, velocity, dispersion, of, material, around, it, is, measured, to, be, 160, km, s, 100, mi, s, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, observed, double, nucleus, could, be, explained, if, p1, is, the, projection, of, a, disk, of, stars, in, an, eccentric, orbit, around, the, central, black, hole, the, eccentricity, is, such, that, stars, linger, at, the, orbital, apocenter, creating, a, concentration, of, stars, it, has, been, postulated, that, such, an, eccentric, disk, could, have, been, formed, from, the, result, of, a, previous, black, hole, merger, where, the, release, of, gravitational, waves, could, have, kicked, the, stars, into, their, current, eccentric, distribution, p2, also, contains, a, compact, disk, of, hot, spectral, class, a, stars, the, a, stars, are, not, evident, in, redder, filters, but, in, blue, and, ultraviolet, light, they, dominate, the, nucleus, causing, p2, to, appear, more, prominent, than, p1, while, at, the, initial, time, of, its, discovery, it, was, hypothesized, that, the, brighter, portion, of, the, double, nucleus, is, the, remnant, of, a, small, galaxy, cannibalized, by, the, andromeda, galaxy, this, is, no, longer, considered, a, viable, explanation, largely, because, such, a, nucleus, would, have, an, exceedingly, short, lifetime, due, to, tidal, disruption, by, the, central, black, hole, while, this, could, be, partially, resolved, if, p1, had, its, own, black, hole, to, stabilize, it, the, distribution, of, stars, in, p1, does, not, suggest, that, there, is, a, black, hole, at, its, center, apparently, by, late, 1968, no, x, rays, had, been, detected, from, the, andromeda, galaxy, a, balloon, flight, on, 20, october, 1970, set, an, upper, limit, for, detectable, hard, x, rays, from, the, andromeda, galaxy, the, swift, bat, all, sky, survey, successfully, detected, hard, x, rays, coming, from, a, region, centered, 6, arcseconds, away, from, the, galaxy, center, the, emission, above, 25, kev, was, later, found, to, be, originating, from, a, single, source, named, 3xmm, j004232, 1, 411314, and, identified, as, a, binary, system, where, a, compact, object, a, neutron, star, or, a, black, hole, accretes, matter, from, a, star, multiple, x, ray, sources, have, since, been, detected, in, the, andromeda, galaxy, using, observations, from, the, european, space, agency, s, esa, xmm, newton, orbiting, observatory, robin, barnard, et, al, hypothesized, that, these, are, candidate, black, holes, or, neutron, stars, which, are, heating, the, incoming, gas, to, millions, of, kelvins, and, emitting, x, rays, neutron, stars, and, black, holes, can, be, distinguished, mainly, by, measuring, their, masses, an, observation, campaign, of, nustar, space, mission, identified, 40, objects, of, this, kind, in, the, galaxy, in, 2012, a, microquasar, a, radio, burst, emanating, from, a, smaller, black, hole, was, detected, in, the, andromeda, galaxy, the, progenitor, black, hole, is, located, near, the, galactic, center, and, has, about, 10, m, it, was, discovered, through, data, collected, by, the, european, space, agency, s, xmm, newton, probe, and, was, subsequently, observed, by, nasa, s, swift, gamma, ray, burst, mission, and, chandra, x, ray, observatory, the, very, large, array, and, the, very, long, baseline, array, the, microquasar, was, the, first, observed, within, the, andromeda, galaxy, and, the, first, outside, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, there, are, approximately, 460, globular, clusters, associated, with, the, andromeda, galaxy, the, most, massive, of, these, clusters, identified, as, mayall, ii, nicknamed, globular, one, has, a, greater, luminosity, than, any, other, known, globular, cluster, in, the, local, group, of, galaxies, it, contains, several, million, stars, and, is, about, twice, as, luminous, as, omega, centauri, the, brightest, known, globular, cluster, in, the, milky, way, globular, one, or, g1, has, several, stellar, populations, and, a, structure, too, massive, for, an, ordinary, globular, as, a, result, some, consider, g1, to, be, the, remnant, core, of, a, dwarf, galaxy, that, was, consumed, by, andromeda, in, the, distant, past, the, globular, with, the, greatest, apparent, brightness, is, g76, which, is, located, in, the, southwest, arm, s, eastern, half, another, massive, globular, cluster, named, 037, b327, and, discovered, in, 2006, as, is, heavily, reddened, by, the, andromeda, galaxy, s, interstellar, dust, was, thought, to, be, more, massive, than, g1, and, the, largest, cluster, of, the, local, group, however, other, studies, have, shown, it, is, actually, similar, in, properties, to, g1, unlike, the, globular, clusters, of, the, milky, way, which, show, a, relatively, low, age, dispersion, andromeda, galaxy, s, globular, clusters, have, a, much, larger, range, of, ages, from, systems, as, old, as, the, galaxy, itself, to, much, younger, systems, with, ages, between, a, few, hundred, million, years, to, five, billion, years, in, 2005, astronomers, discovered, a, completely, new, type, of, star, cluster, in, the, andromeda, galaxy, the, new, found, clusters, contain, hundreds, of, thousands, of, stars, a, similar, number, of, stars, that, can, be, found, in, globular, clusters, what, distinguishes, them, from, the, globular, clusters, is, that, they, are, much, larger, several, hundred, light, years, across, and, hundreds, of, times, less, dense, the, distances, between, the, stars, are, therefore, much, greater, within, the, newly, discovered, extended, clusters, the, most, massive, globular, cluster, in, the, andromeda, galaxy, b023, g078, likely, has, a, central, intermediate, black, hole, of, almost, 100, 000, solar, masses, pa, 99, n2, was, a, microlensing, event, detected, in, the, andromeda, galaxy, in, 1999, one, of, the, explanations, for, this, is, the, gravitational, lensing, of, a, red, giant, by, a, star, with, a, mass, between, 0, 02, and, 3, 6, times, that, of, the, sun, which, suggested, that, the, star, is, likely, orbited, by, a, planet, this, possible, exoplanet, would, have, a, mass, 6, 34, times, that, of, jupiter, if, finally, confirmed, it, would, be, the, first, ever, found, extragalactic, planet, however, anomalies, in, the, event, were, later, found, like, the, milky, way, the, andromeda, galaxy, has, smaller, satellite, galaxies, consisting, of, over, 20, known, dwarf, galaxies, the, andromeda, galaxy, s, dwarf, galaxy, population, is, very, similar, to, the, milky, way, s, but, the, galaxies, are, much, more, numerous, the, best, known, and, most, readily, observed, satellite, galaxies, are, m32, and, m110, based, on, current, evidence, it, appears, that, m32, underwent, a, close, encounter, with, the, andromeda, galaxy, in, the, past, m32, may, once, have, been, a, larger, galaxy, that, had, its, stellar, disk, removed, by, m31, and, underwent, a, sharp, increase, of, star, formation, in, the, core, region, which, lasted, until, the, relatively, recent, past, m110, also, appears, to, be, interacting, with, the, andromeda, galaxy, and, astronomers, have, found, in, the, halo, of, the, latter, a, stream, of, metal, rich, stars, that, appear, to, have, been, stripped, from, these, satellite, galaxies, m110, does, contain, a, dusty, lane, which, may, indicate, recent, or, ongoing, star, formation, m32, has, a, young, stellar, population, as, well, the, triangulum, galaxy, is, a, non, dwarf, galaxy, that, lies, 750, 000, light, years, from, andromeda, it, is, currently, unknown, whether, it, is, a, satellite, of, andromeda, in, 2006, it, was, discovered, that, nine, of, the, satellite, galaxies, lie, in, a, plane, that, intersects, the, core, of, the, andromeda, galaxy, they, are, not, randomly, arranged, as, would, be, expected, from, independent, interactions, this, may, indicate, a, common, tidal, origin, for, the, satellites, the, andromeda, galaxy, is, approaching, the, milky, way, at, about, 110, kilometres, 68, miles, per, second, it, has, been, measured, approaching, relative, to, the, sun, at, around, 300, km, s, 190, mi, s, as, the, sun, orbits, around, the, center, of, the, galaxy, at, a, speed, of, approximately, 225, km, s, 140, mi, s, this, makes, the, andromeda, galaxy, one, of, about, 100, observable, blueshifted, galaxies, andromeda, galaxy, s, tangential, or, sideways, velocity, concerning, the, milky, way, is, relatively, much, smaller, than, the, approaching, velocity, and, therefore, it, is, expected, to, collide, directly, with, the, milky, way, in, about, 2, 5, 4, billion, years, a, likely, outcome, of, the, collision, is, that, the, galaxies, will, merge, to, form, a, giant, elliptical, galaxy, or, possibly, large, disc, galaxy, such, events, are, frequent, among, the, galaxies, in, galaxy, groups, the, fate, of, earth, and, the, solar, system, in, the, event, of, a, collision, is, currently, unknown, before, the, galaxies, merge, there, is, a, small, chance, that, the, solar, system, could, be, ejected, from, the, milky, way, or, join, the, andromeda, galaxy, under, most, viewing, conditions, the, andromeda, galaxy, is, one, of, the, most, distant, objects, that, can, be, seen, with, the, naked, eye, due, to, its, sheer, size, m33, and, for, observers, with, exceptionally, good, vision, m81, can, be, seen, under, very, dark, skies, the, galaxy, is, commonly, located, in, the, sky, about, the, constellations, cassiopeia, and, pegasus, andromeda, is, best, seen, during, autumn, nights, in, the, northern, hemisphere, when, it, passes, high, overhead, reaching, its, highest, point, around, midnight, in, october, and, two, hours, earlier, each, successive, month, in, the, early, evening, it, rises, in, the, east, in, september, and, sets, in, the, west, in, february, from, the, southern, hemisphere, the, andromeda, galaxy, is, visible, between, october, and, december, best, viewed, from, as, far, north, as, possible, binoculars, can, reveal, some, larger, structures, of, the, galaxy, and, its, two, brightest, satellite, galaxies, m32, and, m110, an, amateur, telescope, can, reveal, andromeda, s, disk, some, of, its, brightest, globular, clusters, dark, dust, lanes, and, the, large, star, cloud, ngc, 206, it, is, uncertain, whether, these, are, companion, galaxies, of, the, andromeda, galaxy
