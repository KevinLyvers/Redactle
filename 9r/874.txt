in, condensed, matter, physics, and, materials, science, an, amorphous, solid, or, non, crystalline, solid, is, a, solid, that, lacks, the, long, range, order, that, is, characteristic, of, a, crystal, the, terms, glass, and, glassy, solid, are, sometimes, used, synonymously, with, amorphous, solid, however, these, terms, refer, specifically, to, amorphous, materials, that, undergo, a, glass, transition, examples, of, amorphous, solids, include, glasses, metallic, glasses, and, certain, types, of, plastics, and, polymers, the, term, comes, from, the, greek, a, without, and, morph, shape, form, amorphous, materials, have, an, internal, structure, of, molecular, scale, structural, blocks, that, can, be, similar, to, the, basic, structural, units, in, the, crystalline, phase, of, the, same, compound, unlike, in, crystalline, materials, however, no, long, range, regularity, exists, amorphous, materials, cannot, be, described, by, the, repetition, of, a, finite, unit, cell, statistical, measures, such, as, the, atomic, density, function, and, radial, distribution, function, are, more, useful, in, describing, the, structure, of, amorphous, solids, although, amorphous, materials, lack, long, range, order, they, exhibit, localized, order, on, small, length, scales, by, convention, short, range, order, extends, only, to, the, nearest, neighbor, shell, typically, only, 1, 2, atomic, spacings, medium, range, order, may, extend, beyond, the, short, range, order, by, 1, 2, nm, the, freezing, from, liquid, state, to, amorphous, solid, glass, transition, is, considered, one, of, the, very, important, and, unsolved, problems, of, physics, at, very, low, temperatures, below, 1, 10, k, large, family, of, amorphous, solids, have, various, similar, low, temperature, properties, although, there, are, various, theoretical, models, neither, glass, transition, nor, low, temperature, properties, of, glassy, solids, are, well, understood, on, the, fundamental, physics, level, amorphous, solids, is, an, important, area, of, condensed, matter, physics, aiming, to, understand, these, substances, at, high, temperatures, of, glass, transition, and, at, low, temperatures, towards, absolute, zero, from, 1970s, low, temperature, properties, of, amorphous, solids, were, studied, experimentally, in, great, detail, for, all, of, these, substances, specific, heat, has, a, nearly, linear, dependence, as, a, function, of, temperature, and, thermal, conductivity, has, nearly, quadratic, temperature, dependence, these, properties, are, conventionally, called, anomalous, being, very, different, from, properties, of, crystalline, solids, on, the, phenomenological, level, many, of, these, properties, were, described, by, a, collection, of, tunneling, two, level, systems, nevertheless, the, microscopic, theory, of, these, properties, is, still, missing, after, more, than, 50, years, of, the, research, remarkably, a, dimensionless, quantity, of, internal, friction, is, nearly, universal, in, these, materials, this, quantity, is, a, dimensionless, ratio, up, to, a, numerical, constant, of, the, phonon, wavelength, to, the, phonon, mean, free, path, since, the, theory, of, tunneling, two, level, states, tlss, does, not, address, the, origin, of, the, density, of, tlss, this, theory, cannot, explain, the, universality, of, internal, friction, which, in, turn, is, proportional, to, the, density, of, scattering, tlss, the, theoretical, significance, of, this, important, and, unsolved, problem, was, highlighted, by, anthony, leggett, amorphous, materials, will, have, some, degree, of, short, range, order, at, the, atomic, length, scale, due, to, the, nature, of, intermolecular, chemical, bonding, furthermore, in, very, small, crystals, short, range, order, encompasses, a, large, fraction, of, the, atoms, nevertheless, relaxation, at, the, surface, along, with, interfacial, effects, distorts, the, atomic, positions, and, decreases, structural, order, even, the, most, advanced, structural, characterization, techniques, such, as, x, ray, diffraction, and, transmission, electron, microscopy, can, have, difficulty, distinguishing, amorphous, and, crystalline, structures, at, short, size, scales, due, to, the, lack, of, long, range, order, standard, crystallographic, techniques, are, often, inadequate, in, determining, the, structure, of, amorphous, solids, a, variety, of, electron, x, ray, and, computation, based, techniques, have, been, used, to, characterize, amorphous, materials, multi, modal, analysis, is, very, common, for, amorphous, materials, unlike, crystalline, materials, which, exhibit, strong, bragg, diffraction, the, diffraction, patterns, of, amorphous, materials, are, characterized, by, broad, and, diffuse, peaks, as, a, result, detailed, analysis, and, complementary, techniques, are, required, to, extract, real, space, structural, information, from, the, diffraction, patterns, of, amorphous, materials, it, is, useful, to, obtain, diffraction, data, from, both, x, ray, and, neutron, sources, as, they, have, different, scattering, properties, and, provide, complementary, data, pair, distribution, function, analysis, can, be, performed, on, diffraction, data, to, determine, the, probability, of, finding, a, pair, of, atoms, separated, by, a, certain, distance, another, type, of, analysis, that, is, done, with, diffraction, data, of, amorphous, materials, is, radial, distribution, function, analysis, which, measures, the, number, of, atoms, found, at, varying, radial, distances, away, from, an, arbitrary, reference, atom, from, these, techniques, the, local, order, of, an, amorphous, material, can, be, elucidated, x, ray, absorption, fine, structure, spectroscopy, is, an, atomic, scale, probe, making, it, useful, for, studying, materials, lacking, in, long, range, order, spectra, obtained, using, this, method, provide, information, on, the, oxidation, state, coordination, number, and, species, surrounding, the, atom, in, question, as, well, as, the, distances, at, which, they, are, found, the, atomic, electron, tomography, technique, is, performed, in, transmission, electron, microscopes, capable, of, reaching, sub, angstrom, resolution, a, collection, of, 2d, images, taken, at, numerous, different, tilt, angles, is, acquired, from, the, sample, in, question, and, then, used, to, reconstruct, a, 3d, image, after, image, acquisition, a, significant, amount, of, processing, must, be, done, to, correct, for, issues, such, as, drift, noise, and, scan, distortion, high, quality, analysis, and, processing, using, atomic, electron, tomography, results, in, a, 3d, reconstruction, of, an, amorphous, material, detailing, the, atomic, positions, of, the, different, species, that, are, present, fluctuation, electron, microscopy, is, another, transmission, electron, microscopy, based, technique, that, is, sensitive, to, the, medium, range, order, of, amorphous, materials, structural, fluctuations, arising, from, different, forms, of, medium, range, order, can, be, detected, with, this, method, fluctuation, electron, microscopy, experiments, can, be, done, in, conventional, or, scanning, transmission, electron, microscope, mode, simulation, and, modeling, techniques, are, often, combined, with, experimental, methods, to, characterize, structures, of, amorphous, materials, commonly, used, computational, techniques, include, density, functional, theory, molecular, dynamics, and, reverse, monte, carlo, amorphous, phases, are, important, constituents, of, thin, films, thin, films, are, solid, layers, of, a, few, nanometres, to, tens, of, micrometres, thickness, that, are, deposited, onto, a, substrate, so, called, structure, zone, models, were, developed, to, describe, the, microstructure, of, thin, films, as, a, function, of, the, homologous, temperature, t, h, which, is, the, ratio, of, deposition, temperature, to, melting, temperature, according, to, these, models, a, necessary, condition, for, the, occurrence, of, amorphous, phases, is, that, t, h, has, to, be, smaller, than, 0, 3, the, deposition, temperature, must, be, below, 30, of, the, melting, temperature, regarding, their, applications, amorphous, metallic, layers, played, an, important, role, in, the, discovery, of, superconductivity, in, amorphous, metals, made, by, buckel, and, hilsch, the, superconductivity, of, amorphous, metals, including, amorphous, metallic, thin, films, is, now, understood, to, be, due, to, phonon, mediated, cooper, pairing, the, role, of, structural, disorder, can, be, rationalized, based, on, the, strong, coupling, eliashberg, theory, of, superconductivity, amorphous, solids, typically, exhibit, higher, localization, of, heat, carriers, compared, to, crystalline, giving, rise, to, low, thermal, conductivity, products, for, thermal, protection, such, as, thermal, barrier, coatings, and, insulation, rely, on, materials, with, ultralow, thermal, conductivity, today, optical, coatings, made, from, tio, 2, sio, 2, ta, 2, o, 5, etc, and, combinations, of, these, in, most, cases, consist, of, amorphous, phases, of, these, compounds, much, research, is, carried, out, into, thin, amorphous, films, as, a, gas, separating, membrane, layer, the, technologically, most, important, thin, amorphous, film, is, probably, represented, by, a, few, nm, thin, sio, 2, layers, serving, as, isolator, above, the, conducting, channel, of, a, metal, oxide, semiconductor, field, effect, transistor, mosfet, also, hydrogenated, amorphous, silicon, si, h, is, of, technical, significance, for, thin, film, solar, cells, in, the, pharmaceutical, industry, some, amorphous, drugs, have, been, shown, to, offer, higher, bioavailability, than, their, crystalline, counterparts, as, a, result, of, the, higher, solubility, of, the, amorphous, phase, however, certain, compounds, can, undergo, precipitation, in, their, amorphous, form, in, vivo, and, can, then, decrease, mutual, bioavailability, if, administered, together, amorphous, materials, in, soil, strongly, influence, bulk, density, aggregate, stability, plasticity, and, water, holding, capacity, of, soils, the, low, bulk, density, and, high, void, ratios, are, mostly, due, to, glass, shards, and, other, porous, minerals, not, becoming, compacted, andisol, soils, contain, the, highest, amounts, of, amorphous, materials, the, occurrence, of, amorphous, phases, turned, out, to, be, a, phenomenon, of, particular, interest, for, the, studying, of, thin, film, growth, the, growth, of, polycrystalline, films, is, often, used, and, preceded, by, an, initial, amorphous, layer, the, thickness, of, which, may, amount, to, only, a, few, nm, the, most, investigated, example, is, represented, by, the, unoriented, molecules, of, thin, polycrystalline, silicon, films, wedge, shaped, polycrystals, were, identified, by, transmission, electron, microscopy, to, grow, out, of, the, amorphous, phase, only, after, the, latter, has, exceeded, a, certain, thickness, the, precise, value, of, which, depends, on, deposition, temperature, background, pressure, and, various, other, process, parameters, the, phenomenon, has, been, interpreted, in, the, framework, of, ostwald, s, rule, of, stages, that, predicts, the, formation, of, phases, to, proceed, with, increasing, condensation, time, towards, increasing, stability
