continuum, mechanics, is, a, branch, of, mechanics, that, deals, with, the, deformation, of, and, transmission, of, forces, through, materials, modeled, as, a, continuous, medium, also, called, a, continuum, rather, than, as, discrete, particles, the, french, mathematician, augustin, louis, cauchy, was, the, first, to, formulate, such, models, in, the, 19th, century, continuum, mechanics, deals, with, deformable, bodies, as, opposed, to, rigid, bodies, a, continuum, model, assumes, that, the, substance, of, the, object, completely, fills, the, space, it, occupies, while, ignoring, the, fact, that, matter, is, made, of, atoms, this, provides, a, sufficiently, accurate, description, of, matter, on, length, scales, much, greater, than, that, of, inter, atomic, distances, the, concept, of, a, continuous, medium, allows, for, intuitive, analysis, of, bulk, matter, by, using, differential, equations, that, describe, the, behavior, of, such, matter, according, to, physical, laws, such, as, mass, conservation, momentum, conservation, and, energy, conservation, information, about, the, specific, material, is, expressed, in, constitutive, relationships, continuum, mechanics, treats, the, physical, properties, of, solids, and, fluids, independently, of, any, particular, coordinate, system, in, which, they, are, observed, these, properties, are, represented, by, tensors, which, are, mathematical, objects, with, the, salient, property, of, being, independent, of, coordinate, systems, this, permits, definition, of, physical, properties, at, any, point, in, the, continuum, according, to, mathematically, convenient, continuous, functions, the, theories, of, elasticity, plasticity, and, fluid, mechanics, are, based, on, the, concepts, of, continuum, mechanics, the, concept, of, a, continuum, underlies, the, mathematical, framework, for, studying, large, scale, forces, and, deformations, in, materials, although, materials, are, composed, of, discrete, atoms, and, molecules, separated, by, empty, space, or, microscopic, cracks, and, crystallographic, defects, physical, phenomena, can, often, be, modeled, by, considering, a, substance, distributed, throughout, some, region, of, space, a, continuum, is, a, body, that, can, be, continually, sub, divided, into, infinitesimal, elements, with, local, material, properties, defined, at, any, particular, point, properties, of, the, bulk, material, can, therefore, be, described, by, continuous, functions, and, their, evolution, can, be, studied, using, the, mathematics, of, calculus, apart, from, the, assumption, of, continuity, two, other, independent, assumptions, are, often, employed, in, the, study, of, continuum, mechanics, these, are, homogeneity, assumption, of, identical, properties, at, all, locations, and, isotropy, assumption, of, directionally, invariant, vector, properties, if, these, auxiliary, assumptions, are, not, globally, applicable, the, material, may, be, segregated, into, sections, where, they, are, applicable, in, order, to, simplify, the, analysis, for, more, complex, cases, one, or, both, of, these, assumptions, can, be, dropped, in, these, cases, computational, methods, are, often, used, to, solve, the, differential, equations, describing, the, evolution, of, material, properties, an, additional, area, of, continuum, mechanics, comprises, elastomeric, foams, which, exhibit, a, curious, hyperbolic, stress, strain, relationship, the, elastomer, is, a, true, continuum, but, a, homogeneous, distribution, of, voids, gives, it, unusual, properties, continuum, mechanics, models, begin, by, assigning, a, region, in, three, dimensional, euclidean, space, to, the, material, body, b, displaystyle, mathcal, b, being, modeled, the, points, within, this, region, are, called, particles, or, material, points, different, configurations, or, states, of, the, body, correspond, to, different, regions, in, euclidean, space, the, region, corresponding, to, the, body, s, configuration, at, time, t, displaystyle, t, is, labeled, t, b, displaystyle, kappa, t, mathcal, b, a, particular, particle, within, the, body, in, a, particular, configuration, is, characterized, by, a, position, vector, where, e, i, displaystyle, mathbf, e, i, are, the, coordinate, vectors, in, some, frame, of, reference, chosen, for, the, problem, see, figure, 1, this, vector, can, be, expressed, as, a, function, of, the, particle, position, x, displaystyle, mathbf, x, in, some, reference, configuration, for, example, the, configuration, at, the, initial, time, so, that, this, function, needs, to, have, various, properties, so, that, the, model, makes, physical, sense, t, displaystyle, kappa, t, cdot, needs, to, be, for, the, mathematical, formulation, of, the, model, t, displaystyle, kappa, t, cdot, is, also, assumed, to, be, twice, continuously, differentiable, so, that, differential, equations, describing, the, motion, may, be, formulated, a, solid, is, a, deformable, body, that, possesses, shear, strength, sc, a, solid, can, support, shear, forces, forces, parallel, to, the, material, surface, on, which, they, act, fluids, on, the, other, hand, do, not, sustain, shear, forces, following, the, classical, dynamics, of, newton, and, euler, the, motion, of, a, material, body, is, produced, by, the, action, of, externally, applied, forces, which, are, assumed, to, be, of, two, kinds, surface, forces, f, c, displaystyle, mathbf, f, c, and, body, forces, f, b, displaystyle, mathbf, f, b, thus, the, total, force, f, displaystyle, mathcal, f, applied, to, a, body, or, to, a, portion, of, the, body, can, be, expressed, as, surface, forces, or, contact, forces, expressed, as, force, per, unit, area, can, act, either, on, the, bounding, surface, of, the, body, as, a, result, of, mechanical, contact, with, other, bodies, or, on, imaginary, internal, surfaces, that, bound, portions, of, the, body, as, a, result, of, the, mechanical, interaction, between, the, parts, of, the, body, to, either, side, of, the, surface, euler, cauchy, s, stress, principle, when, a, body, is, acted, upon, by, external, contact, forces, internal, contact, forces, are, then, transmitted, from, point, to, point, inside, the, body, to, balance, their, action, according, to, newton, s, third, law, of, motion, of, conservation, of, linear, momentum, and, angular, momentum, for, continuous, bodies, these, laws, are, called, the, euler, s, equations, of, motion, the, internal, contact, forces, are, related, to, the, body, s, deformation, through, constitutive, equations, the, internal, contact, forces, may, be, mathematically, described, by, how, they, relate, to, the, motion, of, the, body, independent, of, the, body, s, material, makeup, the, distribution, of, internal, contact, forces, throughout, the, volume, of, the, body, is, assumed, to, be, continuous, therefore, there, exists, a, contact, force, density, or, cauchy, traction, field, t, n, x, t, displaystyle, mathbf, t, mathbf, n, mathbf, x, t, that, represents, this, distribution, in, a, particular, configuration, of, the, body, at, a, given, time, t, displaystyle, t, it, is, not, a, vector, field, because, it, depends, not, only, on, the, position, x, displaystyle, mathbf, x, of, a, particular, material, point, but, also, on, the, local, orientation, of, the, surface, element, as, defined, by, its, normal, vector, n, displaystyle, mathbf, n, any, differential, area, d, s, displaystyle, ds, with, normal, vector, n, displaystyle, mathbf, n, of, a, given, internal, surface, area, s, displaystyle, s, bounding, a, portion, of, the, body, experiences, a, contact, force, d, f, c, displaystyle, d, mathbf, f, c, arising, from, the, contact, between, both, portions, of, the, body, on, each, side, of, s, displaystyle, s, and, it, is, given, by, where, t, n, displaystyle, mathbf, t, mathbf, n, is, the, surface, traction, also, called, stress, vector, traction, or, traction, vector, the, stress, vector, is, a, frame, indifferent, vector, see, euler, cauchy, s, stress, principle, the, total, contact, force, on, the, particular, internal, surface, s, displaystyle, s, is, then, expressed, as, the, sum, surface, integral, of, the, contact, forces, on, all, differential, surfaces, d, s, displaystyle, ds, in, continuum, mechanics, a, body, is, considered, stress, free, if, the, only, forces, present, are, those, inter, atomic, forces, ionic, metallic, and, van, der, waals, forces, required, to, hold, the, body, together, and, to, keep, its, shape, in, the, absence, of, all, external, influences, including, gravitational, attraction, stresses, generated, during, manufacture, of, the, body, to, a, specific, configuration, are, also, excluded, when, considering, stresses, in, a, body, therefore, the, stresses, considered, in, continuum, mechanics, are, only, those, produced, by, deformation, of, the, body, sc, only, relative, changes, in, stress, are, considered, not, the, absolute, values, of, stress, body, forces, are, forces, originating, from, sources, outside, of, the, body, that, act, on, the, volume, or, mass, of, the, body, saying, that, body, forces, are, due, to, outside, sources, implies, that, the, interaction, between, different, parts, of, the, body, internal, forces, are, manifested, through, the, contact, forces, alone, these, forces, arise, from, the, presence, of, the, body, in, force, fields, e, g, gravitational, field, gravitational, forces, or, electromagnetic, field, electromagnetic, forces, or, from, inertial, forces, when, bodies, are, in, motion, as, the, mass, of, a, continuous, body, is, assumed, to, be, continuously, distributed, any, force, originating, from, the, mass, is, also, continuously, distributed, thus, body, forces, are, specified, by, vector, fields, which, are, assumed, to, be, continuous, over, the, entire, volume, of, the, body, i, e, acting, on, every, point, in, it, body, forces, are, represented, by, a, body, force, density, b, x, t, displaystyle, mathbf, b, mathbf, x, t, per, unit, of, mass, which, is, a, frame, indifferent, vector, field, in, the, case, of, gravitational, forces, the, intensity, of, the, force, depends, on, or, is, proportional, to, the, mass, density, x, t, displaystyle, mathbf, rho, mathbf, x, t, of, the, material, and, it, is, specified, in, terms, of, force, per, unit, mass, b, i, displaystyle, b, i, or, per, unit, volume, p, i, displaystyle, p, i, these, two, specifications, are, related, through, the, material, density, by, the, equation, b, i, p, i, displaystyle, rho, b, i, p, i, similarly, the, intensity, of, electromagnetic, forces, depends, upon, the, strength, electric, charge, of, the, electromagnetic, field, the, total, body, force, applied, to, a, continuous, body, is, expressed, as, body, forces, and, contact, forces, acting, on, the, body, lead, to, corresponding, moments, of, force, torques, relative, to, a, given, point, thus, the, total, applied, torque, m, displaystyle, mathcal, m, about, the, origin, is, given, by, in, certain, situations, not, commonly, considered, in, the, analysis, of, the, mechanical, behavior, of, materials, it, becomes, necessary, to, include, two, other, types, of, forces, these, are, couple, stresses, surface, couples, contact, torques, and, body, moments, couple, stresses, are, moments, per, unit, area, applied, on, a, surface, body, moments, or, body, couples, are, moments, per, unit, volume, or, per, unit, mass, applied, to, the, volume, of, the, body, both, are, important, in, the, analysis, of, stress, for, a, polarized, dielectric, solid, under, the, action, of, an, electric, field, materials, where, the, molecular, structure, is, taken, into, consideration, e, g, bones, solids, under, the, action, of, an, external, magnetic, field, and, the, dislocation, theory, of, metals, materials, that, exhibit, body, couples, and, couple, stresses, in, addition, to, moments, produced, exclusively, by, forces, are, called, polar, materials, non, polar, materials, are, then, those, materials, with, only, moments, of, forces, in, the, classical, branches, of, continuum, mechanics, the, development, of, the, theory, of, stresses, is, based, on, non, polar, materials, thus, the, sum, of, all, applied, forces, and, torques, with, respect, to, the, origin, of, the, coordinate, system, in, the, body, can, be, given, by, a, change, in, the, configuration, of, a, continuum, body, results, in, a, displacement, the, displacement, of, a, body, has, two, components, a, rigid, body, displacement, and, a, deformation, a, rigid, body, displacement, consists, of, a, simultaneous, translation, and, rotation, of, the, body, without, changing, its, shape, or, size, deformation, implies, the, change, in, shape, and, or, size, of, the, body, from, an, initial, or, undeformed, configuration, 0, b, displaystyle, kappa, 0, mathcal, b, to, a, current, or, deformed, configuration, t, b, displaystyle, kappa, t, mathcal, b, figure, 2, the, motion, of, a, continuum, body, is, a, continuous, time, sequence, of, displacements, thus, the, material, body, will, occupy, different, configurations, at, different, times, so, that, a, particle, occupies, a, series, of, points, in, space, which, describe, a, path, line, there, is, continuity, during, motion, or, deformation, of, a, continuum, body, in, the, sense, that, it, is, convenient, to, identify, a, reference, configuration, or, initial, condition, which, all, subsequent, configurations, are, referenced, from, the, reference, configuration, need, not, be, one, that, the, body, will, ever, occupy, often, the, configuration, at, t, 0, displaystyle, t, 0, is, considered, the, reference, configuration, 0, b, displaystyle, kappa, 0, mathcal, b, the, components, x, i, displaystyle, x, i, of, the, position, vector, x, displaystyle, mathbf, x, of, a, particle, taken, with, respect, to, the, reference, configuration, are, called, the, material, or, reference, coordinates, when, analyzing, the, motion, or, deformation, of, solids, or, the, flow, of, fluids, it, is, necessary, to, describe, the, sequence, or, evolution, of, configurations, throughout, time, one, description, for, motion, is, made, in, terms, of, the, material, or, referential, coordinates, called, material, description, or, lagrangian, description, in, the, lagrangian, description, the, position, and, physical, properties, of, the, particles, are, described, in, terms, of, the, material, or, referential, coordinates, and, time, in, this, case, the, reference, configuration, is, the, configuration, at, t, 0, displaystyle, t, 0, an, observer, standing, in, the, frame, of, reference, observes, the, changes, in, the, position, and, physical, properties, as, the, material, body, moves, in, space, as, time, progresses, the, results, obtained, are, independent, of, the, choice, of, initial, time, and, reference, configuration, 0, b, displaystyle, kappa, 0, mathcal, b, this, description, is, normally, used, in, solid, mechanics, in, the, lagrangian, description, the, motion, of, a, continuum, body, is, expressed, by, the, mapping, function, displaystyle, chi, cdot, figure, 2, which, is, a, mapping, of, the, initial, configuration, 0, b, displaystyle, kappa, 0, mathcal, b, onto, the, current, configuration, t, b, displaystyle, kappa, t, mathcal, b, giving, a, geometrical, correspondence, between, them, i, e, giving, the, position, vector, x, x, i, e, i, displaystyle, mathbf, x, x, i, mathbf, e, i, that, a, particle, x, displaystyle, x, with, a, position, vector, x, displaystyle, mathbf, x, in, the, undeformed, or, reference, configuration, 0, b, displaystyle, kappa, 0, mathcal, b, will, occupy, in, the, current, or, deformed, configuration, t, b, displaystyle, kappa, t, mathcal, b, at, time, t, displaystyle, t, the, components, x, i, displaystyle, x, i, are, called, the, spatial, coordinates, physical, and, kinematic, properties, p, i, j, displaystyle, p, ij, ldots, i, e, thermodynamic, properties, and, flow, velocity, which, describe, or, characterize, features, of, the, material, body, are, expressed, as, continuous, functions, of, position, and, time, i, e, p, i, j, p, i, j, x, t, displaystyle, p, ij, ldots, p, ij, ldots, mathbf, x, t, the, material, derivative, of, any, property, p, i, j, displaystyle, p, ij, ldots, of, a, continuum, which, may, be, a, scalar, vector, or, tensor, is, the, time, rate, of, change, of, that, property, for, a, specific, group, of, particles, of, the, moving, continuum, body, the, material, derivative, is, also, known, as, the, substantial, derivative, or, comoving, derivative, or, convective, derivative, it, can, be, thought, as, the, rate, at, which, the, property, changes, when, measured, by, an, observer, traveling, with, that, group, of, particles, in, the, lagrangian, description, the, material, derivative, of, p, i, j, displaystyle, p, ij, ldots, is, simply, the, partial, derivative, with, respect, to, time, and, the, position, vector, x, displaystyle, mathbf, x, is, held, constant, as, it, does, not, change, with, time, thus, we, have, the, instantaneous, position, x, displaystyle, mathbf, x, is, a, property, of, a, particle, and, its, material, derivative, is, the, instantaneous, flow, velocity, v, displaystyle, mathbf, v, of, the, particle, therefore, the, flow, velocity, field, of, the, continuum, is, given, by, similarly, the, acceleration, field, is, given, by, continuity, in, the, lagrangian, description, is, expressed, by, the, spatial, and, temporal, continuity, of, the, mapping, from, the, reference, configuration, to, the, current, configuration, of, the, material, points, all, physical, quantities, characterizing, the, continuum, are, described, this, way, in, this, sense, the, function, displaystyle, chi, cdot, and, p, i, j, displaystyle, p, ij, ldots, cdot, are, single, valued, and, continuous, with, continuous, derivatives, with, respect, to, space, and, time, to, whatever, order, is, required, usually, to, the, second, or, third, continuity, allows, for, the, inverse, of, displaystyle, chi, cdot, to, trace, backwards, where, the, particle, currently, located, at, x, displaystyle, mathbf, x, was, located, in, the, initial, or, referenced, configuration, 0, b, displaystyle, kappa, 0, mathcal, b, in, this, case, the, description, of, motion, is, made, in, terms, of, the, spatial, coordinates, in, which, case, is, called, the, spatial, description, or, eulerian, description, i, e, the, current, configuration, is, taken, as, the, reference, configuration, the, eulerian, description, introduced, by, d, alembert, focuses, on, the, current, configuration, t, b, displaystyle, kappa, t, mathcal, b, giving, attention, to, what, is, occurring, at, a, fixed, point, in, space, as, time, progresses, instead, of, giving, attention, to, individual, particles, as, they, move, through, space, and, time, this, approach, is, conveniently, applied, in, the, study, of, fluid, flow, where, the, kinematic, property, of, greatest, interest, is, the, rate, at, which, change, is, taking, place, rather, than, the, shape, of, the, body, of, fluid, at, a, reference, time, mathematically, the, motion, of, a, continuum, using, the, eulerian, description, is, expressed, by, the, mapping, function, which, provides, a, tracing, of, the, particle, which, now, occupies, the, position, x, displaystyle, mathbf, x, in, the, current, configuration, t, b, displaystyle, kappa, t, mathcal, b, to, its, original, position, x, displaystyle, mathbf, x, in, the, initial, configuration, 0, b, displaystyle, kappa, 0, mathcal, b, a, necessary, and, sufficient, condition, for, this, inverse, function, to, exist, is, that, the, determinant, of, the, jacobian, matrix, often, referred, to, simply, as, the, jacobian, should, be, different, from, zero, thus, in, the, eulerian, description, the, physical, properties, p, i, j, displaystyle, p, ij, ldots, are, expressed, as, where, the, functional, form, of, p, i, j, displaystyle, p, ij, ldots, in, the, lagrangian, description, is, not, the, same, as, the, form, of, p, i, j, displaystyle, p, ij, ldots, in, the, eulerian, description, the, material, derivative, of, p, i, j, x, t, displaystyle, p, ij, ldots, mathbf, x, t, using, the, chain, rule, is, then, the, first, term, on, the, right, hand, side, of, this, equation, gives, the, local, rate, of, change, of, the, property, p, i, j, x, t, displaystyle, p, ij, ldots, mathbf, x, t, occurring, at, position, x, displaystyle, mathbf, x, the, second, term, of, the, right, hand, side, is, the, convective, rate, of, change, and, expresses, the, contribution, of, the, particle, changing, position, in, space, motion, continuity, in, the, eulerian, description, is, expressed, by, the, spatial, and, temporal, continuity, and, continuous, differentiability, of, the, flow, velocity, field, all, physical, quantities, are, defined, this, way, at, each, instant, of, time, in, the, current, configuration, as, a, function, of, the, vector, position, x, displaystyle, mathbf, x, the, vector, joining, the, positions, of, a, particle, p, displaystyle, p, in, the, undeformed, configuration, and, deformed, configuration, is, called, the, displacement, vector, u, x, t, u, i, e, i, displaystyle, mathbf, u, mathbf, x, t, u, i, mathbf, e, i, in, the, lagrangian, description, or, u, x, t, u, j, e, j, displaystyle, mathbf, u, mathbf, x, t, u, j, mathbf, e, j, in, the, eulerian, description, a, displacement, field, is, a, vector, field, of, all, displacement, vectors, for, all, particles, in, the, body, which, relates, the, deformed, configuration, with, the, undeformed, configuration, it, is, convenient, to, do, the, analysis, of, deformation, or, motion, of, a, continuum, body, in, terms, of, the, displacement, field, in, general, the, displacement, field, is, expressed, in, terms, of, the, material, coordinates, as, or, in, terms, of, the, spatial, coordinates, as, where, j, i, displaystyle, alpha, ji, are, the, direction, cosines, between, the, material, and, spatial, coordinate, systems, with, unit, vectors, e, j, displaystyle, mathbf, e, j, and, e, i, displaystyle, mathbf, e, i, respectively, thus, and, the, relationship, between, u, i, displaystyle, u, i, and, u, j, displaystyle, u, j, is, then, given, by, knowing, that, then, it, is, common, to, superimpose, the, coordinate, systems, for, the, undeformed, and, deformed, configurations, which, results, in, b, 0, displaystyle, mathbf, b, 0, and, the, direction, cosines, become, kronecker, deltas, i, e, thus, we, have, or, in, terms, of, the, spatial, coordinates, as, continuum, mechanics, deals, with, the, behavior, of, materials, that, can, be, approximated, as, continuous, for, certain, length, and, time, scales, the, equations, that, govern, the, mechanics, of, such, materials, include, the, balance, laws, for, mass, momentum, and, energy, kinematic, relations, and, constitutive, equations, are, needed, to, complete, the, system, of, governing, equations, physical, restrictions, on, the, form, of, the, constitutive, relations, can, be, applied, by, requiring, that, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, be, satisfied, under, all, conditions, in, the, continuum, mechanics, of, solids, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, is, satisfied, if, the, clausius, duhem, form, of, the, entropy, inequality, is, satisfied, the, balance, laws, express, the, idea, that, the, rate, of, change, of, a, quantity, mass, momentum, energy, in, a, volume, must, arise, from, three, causes, let, displaystyle, omega, be, the, body, an, open, subset, of, euclidean, space, and, let, displaystyle, partial, omega, be, its, surface, the, boundary, of, displaystyle, omega, let, the, motion, of, material, points, in, the, body, be, described, by, the, map, where, x, displaystyle, mathbf, x, is, the, position, of, a, point, in, the, initial, configuration, and, x, displaystyle, mathbf, x, is, the, location, of, the, same, point, in, the, deformed, configuration, the, deformation, gradient, is, given, by, let, f, x, t, displaystyle, f, mathbf, x, t, be, a, physical, quantity, that, is, flowing, through, the, body, let, g, x, t, displaystyle, g, mathbf, x, t, be, sources, on, the, surface, of, the, body, and, let, h, x, t, displaystyle, h, mathbf, x, t, be, sources, inside, the, body, let, n, x, t, displaystyle, mathbf, n, mathbf, x, t, be, the, outward, unit, normal, to, the, surface, displaystyle, partial, omega, let, v, x, t, displaystyle, mathbf, v, mathbf, x, t, be, the, flow, velocity, of, the, physical, particles, that, carry, the, physical, quantity, that, is, flowing, also, let, the, speed, at, which, the, bounding, surface, displaystyle, partial, omega, is, moving, be, u, n, displaystyle, u, n, in, the, direction, n, displaystyle, mathbf, n, then, balance, laws, can, be, expressed, in, the, general, form, the, functions, f, x, t, displaystyle, f, mathbf, x, t, g, x, t, displaystyle, g, mathbf, x, t, and, h, x, t, displaystyle, h, mathbf, x, t, can, be, scalar, valued, vector, valued, or, tensor, valued, depending, on, the, physical, quantity, that, the, balance, equation, deals, with, if, there, are, internal, boundaries, in, the, body, jump, discontinuities, also, need, to, be, specified, in, the, balance, laws, if, we, take, the, eulerian, point, of, view, it, can, be, shown, that, the, balance, laws, of, mass, momentum, and, energy, for, a, solid, can, be, written, as, assuming, the, source, term, is, zero, for, the, mass, and, angular, momentum, equations, in, the, above, equations, x, t, displaystyle, rho, mathbf, x, t, is, the, mass, density, current,

q, x, t, displaystyle, mathbf, q, mathbf, x, t, is, the, heat, flux, vector, and, s, x, t, displaystyle, s, mathbf, x, t, is, an, energy, source, per, unit, mass, the, operators, used, are, defined, below, with, respect, to, the, reference, configuration, the, lagrangian, point, of, view, the, balance, laws, can, be, written, as, in, the, above, p, displaystyle, boldsymbol, p, is, the, first, piola, kirchhoff, stress, tensor, and, 0, displaystyle, rho, 0, is, the, mass, density, in, the, reference, configuration, the, first, piola, kirchhoff, stress, tensor, is, related, to, the, cauchy, stress, tensor, by, we, can, alternatively, define, the, nominal, stress, tensor, n, displaystyle, boldsymbol, n, which, is, the, transpose, of, the, first, piola, kirchhoff, stress, tensor, such, that, then, the, balance, laws, become, the, operators, in, the, above, equations, are, defined, as, where, v, displaystyle, mathbf, v, is, a, vector, field, s, displaystyle, boldsymbol, s, is, a, second, order, tensor, field, and, e, i, displaystyle, mathbf, e, i, are, the, components, of, an, orthonormal, basis, in, the, current, configuration, also, where, v, displaystyle, mathbf, v, is, a, vector, field, s, displaystyle, boldsymbol, s, is, a, second, order, tensor, field, and, e, i, displaystyle, mathbf, e, i, are, the, components, of, an, orthonormal, basis, in, the, reference, configuration, the, inner, product, is, defined, as, the, clausius, duhem, inequality, can, be, used, to, express, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, for, elastic, plastic, materials, this, inequality, is, a, statement, concerning, the, irreversibility, of, natural, processes, especially, when, energy, dissipation, is, involved, just, like, in, the, balance, laws, in, the, previous, section, we, assume, that, there, is, a, flux, of, a, quantity, a, source, of, the, quantity, and, an, internal, density, of, the, quantity, per, unit, mass, the, quantity, of, interest, in, this, case, is, the, entropy, thus, we, assume, that, there, is, an, entropy, flux, an, entropy, source, an, internal, mass, density, displaystyle, rho, and, an, internal, specific, entropy, i, e, entropy, per, unit, mass, displaystyle, eta, in, the, region, of, interest, let, displaystyle, omega, be, such, a, region, and, let, displaystyle, partial, omega, be, its, boundary, then, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, states, that, the, rate, of, increase, of, displaystyle, eta, in, this, region, is, greater, than, or, equal, to, the, sum, of, that, supplied, to, displaystyle, omega, as, a, flux, or, from, internal, sources, and, the, change, of, the, internal, entropy, density, displaystyle, rho, eta, due, to, material, flowing, in, and, out, of, the, region, let, displaystyle, partial, omega, move, with, a, flow, velocity, u, n, displaystyle, u, n, and, let, particles, inside, displaystyle, omega, have, velocities, v, displaystyle, mathbf, v, let, n, displaystyle, mathbf, n, be, the, unit, outward, normal, to, the, surface, displaystyle, partial, omega, let, displaystyle, rho, be, the, density, of, matter, in, the, region, q, displaystyle, bar, q, be, the, entropy, flux, at, the, surface, and, r, displaystyle, r, be, the, entropy, source, per, unit, mass, then, the, entropy, inequality, may, be, written, as, the, scalar, entropy, flux, can, be, related, to, the, vector, flux, at, the, surface, by, the, relation, q, x, n, displaystyle, bar, q, boldsymbol, psi, mathbf, x, cdot, mathbf, n, under, the, assumption, of, incrementally, isothermal, conditions, we, have, where, q, displaystyle, mathbf, q, is, the, heat, flux, vector, s, displaystyle, s, is, an, energy, source, per, unit, mass, and, t, displaystyle, t, is, the, absolute, temperature, of, a, material, point, at, x, displaystyle, mathbf, x, at, time, t, displaystyle, t, we, then, have, the, clausius, duhem, inequality, in, integral, form, we, can, show, that, the, entropy, inequality, may, be, written, in, differential, form, as, in, terms, of, the, cauchy, stress, and, the, internal, energy, the, clausius, duhem, inequality, may, be, written, as, the, validity, of, the, continuum, assumption, may, be, verified, by, a, theoretical, analysis, in, which, either, some, clear, periodicity, is, identified, or, statistical, homogeneity, and, ergodicity, of, the, microstructure, exist, more, specifically, the, continuum, hypothesis, hinges, on, the, concepts, of, a, representative, elementary, volume, and, separation, of, scales, based, on, the, hill, mandel, condition, this, condition, provides, a, link, between, an, experimentalist, s, and, a, theoretician, s, viewpoint, on, constitutive, equations, linear, and, nonlinear, elastic, inelastic, or, coupled, fields, as, well, as, a, way, of, spatial, and, statistical, averaging, of, the, microstructure, when, the, separation, of, scales, does, not, hold, or, when, one, wants, to, establish, a, continuum, of, a, finer, resolution, than, the, size, of, the, representative, volume, element, rve, a, statistical, volume, element, sve, is, employed, which, results, in, random, continuum, fields, the, latter, then, provide, a, micromechanics, basis, for, stochastic, finite, elements, sfe, the, levels, of, sve, and, rve, link, continuum, mechanics, to, statistical, mechanics, experimentally, the, rve, can, only, be, evaluated, when, the, constitutive, response, is, spatially, homogenous
