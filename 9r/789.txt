a, sea, is, a, large, body, of, salty, water, there, are, particular, seas, and, the, sea, the, sea, commonly, refers, to, the, world, ocean, the, wider, body, of, seawater, particular, seas, are, either, marginal, seas, second, order, sections, of, the, oceanic, sea, e, g, the, mediterranean, sea, or, certain, large, nearly, landlocked, bodies, of, water, the, salinity, of, water, bodies, varies, widely, being, lower, near, the, surface, and, the, mouths, of, large, rivers, and, higher, in, the, depths, of, the, ocean, however, the, relative, proportions, of, dissolved, salts, vary, little, across, the, oceans, the, most, abundant, solid, dissolved, in, seawater, is, sodium, chloride, the, water, also, contains, salts, of, magnesium, calcium, potassium, and, mercury, amongst, many, other, elements, some, in, minute, concentrations, a, wide, variety, of, organisms, including, bacteria, protists, algae, plants, fungi, and, animals, live, in, the, seas, which, offers, a, wide, range, of, marine, habitats, and, ecosystems, ranging, vertically, from, the, sunlit, surface, and, shoreline, to, the, great, depths, and, pressures, of, the, cold, dark, abyssal, zone, and, in, latitude, from, the, cold, waters, under, polar, ice, caps, to, the, warm, waters, of, coral, reefs, in, tropical, regions, many, of, the, major, groups, of, organisms, evolved, in, the, sea, and, life, may, have, started, there, the, ocean, moderates, earth, s, climate, and, has, important, roles, in, the, water, carbon, and, nitrogen, cycles, the, surface, of, water, interacts, with, the, atmosphere, exchanging, properties, such, as, particles, and, temperature, as, well, as, currents, surface, currents, are, the, water, currents, that, are, produced, by, the, atmosphere, s, currents, and, its, winds, blowing, over, the, surface, of, the, water, producing, wind, waves, setting, up, through, drag, slow, but, stable, circulations, of, water, as, in, the, case, of, the, ocean, sustaining, deep, sea, ocean, currents, deep, sea, currents, known, together, as, the, global, conveyor, belt, carry, cold, water, from, near, the, poles, to, every, ocean, and, significantly, influence, earth, s, climate, tides, the, generally, twice, daily, rise, and, fall, of, sea, levels, are, caused, by, earth, s, rotation, and, the, gravitational, effects, of, the, moon, and, to, a, lesser, extent, of, the, sun, tides, may, have, a, very, high, range, in, bays, or, estuaries, submarine, earthquakes, arising, from, tectonic, plate, movements, under, the, oceans, can, lead, to, destructive, tsunamis, as, can, volcanoes, huge, landslides, or, the, impact, of, large, meteorites, the, seas, have, been, an, integral, element, for, humans, throughout, history, and, culture, humans, harnessing, and, studying, the, seas, have, been, recorded, since, ancient, times, and, evidenced, well, into, prehistory, while, its, modern, scientific, study, is, called, oceanography, and, maritime, space, is, governed, by, the, law, of, the, sea, with, admiralty, law, regulating, human, interactions, at, sea, the, seas, provide, substantial, supplies, of, food, for, humans, mainly, fish, but, also, shellfish, mammals, and, seaweed, whether, caught, by, fishermen, or, farmed, underwater, other, human, uses, of, the, seas, include, trade, travel, mineral, extraction, power, generation, warfare, and, leisure, activities, such, as, swimming, sailing, and, scuba, diving, many, of, these, activities, create, marine, pollution, the, sea, is, the, interconnected, system, of, all, the, earth, s, oceanic, waters, including, the, atlantic, pacific, indian, southern, and, arctic, oceans, however, the, word, sea, can, also, be, used, for, many, specific, much, smaller, bodies, of, seawater, such, as, the, north, sea, or, the, red, sea, there, is, no, sharp, distinction, between, seas, and, oceans, though, generally, seas, are, smaller, and, are, often, partly, as, marginal, seas, or, particularly, as, a, mediterranean, sea, or, wholly, as, inland, seas, enclosed, by, land, however, an, exception, to, this, is, the, sargasso, sea, which, has, no, coastline, and, lies, within, a, circular, current, the, north, atlantic, gyre, 90, seas, are, generally, larger, than, lakes, and, contain, salt, water, but, the, sea, of, galilee, is, a, freshwater, lake, the, united, nations, convention, on, the, law, of, the, sea, states, that, all, of, the, ocean, is, sea, the, law, of, the, sea, has, at, its, center, the, definition, of, the, boundaries, of, the, ocean, clarifying, its, application, in, marginal, seas, but, what, bodies, of, water, other, than, the, sea, the, law, applies, to, is, being, crucially, negotiated, in, the, case, of, the, caspian, sea, and, its, status, as, sea, basically, revolving, around, the, issue, of, the, caspian, sea, about, either, being, factually, an, oceanic, sea, or, only, a, saline, body, of, water, and, therefore, solely, a, sea, in, the, sense, of, the, common, use, of, the, word, like, all, other, saltwater, lakes, called, sea, earth, is, the, only, known, planet, with, seas, of, liquid, water, on, its, surface, 22, although, mars, possesses, ice, caps, and, similar, planets, in, other, solar, systems, may, have, oceans, earth, s, 1, 335, 000, 000, cubic, kilometers, 320, 000, 000, cu, mi, of, sea, contain, about, 97, 2, percent, of, its, known, water, and, covers, approximately, 71, percent, of, its, surface, 7, another, 2, 15, of, earth, s, water, is, frozen, found, in, the, sea, ice, covering, the, arctic, ocean, the, ice, cap, covering, antarctica, and, its, adjacent, seas, and, various, glaciers, and, surface, deposits, around, the, world, the, remainder, about, 0, 65, of, the, whole, form, underground, reservoirs, or, various, stages, of, the, water, cycle, containing, the, freshwater, encountered, and, used, by, most, terrestrial, life, vapor, in, the, air, the, clouds, it, slowly, forms, the, rain, falling, from, them, and, the, lakes, and, rivers, spontaneously, formed, as, its, waters, flow, again, and, again, to, the, sea, the, scientific, study, of, water, and, earth, s, water, cycle, is, hydrology, hydrodynamics, studies, the, physics, of, water, in, motion, the, more, recent, study, of, the, sea, in, particular, is, oceanography, this, began, as, the, study, of, the, shape, of, the, ocean, s, currents, but, has, since, expanded, into, a, large, and, multidisciplinary, field, it, examines, the, properties, of, seawater, studies, waves, tides, and, currents, charts, coastlines, and, maps, the, seabeds, and, studies, marine, life, the, subfield, dealing, with, the, sea, s, motion, its, forces, and, the, forces, acting, upon, it, is, known, as, physical, oceanography, marine, biology, biological, oceanography, studies, the, plants, animals, and, other, organisms, inhabiting, marine, ecosystems, both, are, informed, by, chemical, oceanography, which, studies, the, behavior, of, elements, and, molecules, within, the, oceans, particularly, at, the, moment, the, ocean, s, role, in, the, carbon, cycle, and, carbon, dioxide, s, role, in, the, increasing, acidification, of, seawater, marine, and, maritime, geography, charts, the, shape, and, shaping, of, the, sea, while, marine, geology, geological, oceanography, has, provided, evidence, of, continental, drift, and, the, composition, and, structure, of, the, earth, clarified, the, process, of, sedimentation, and, assisted, the, study, of, volcanism, and, earthquakes, a, characteristic, of, seawater, is, that, it, is, salty, salinity, is, usually, measured, in, parts, per, thousand, or, per, mil, and, the, open, ocean, has, about, 35, grams, 1, 2, oz, solids, per, litre, a, salinity, of, 35, the, mediterranean, sea, is, slightly, higher, at, 38, while, the, salinity, of, the, northern, red, sea, can, reach, 41, in, contrast, some, landlocked, hypersaline, lakes, have, a, much, higher, salinity, for, example, the, dead, sea, has, 300, grams, 11, oz, dissolved, solids, per, litre, 300, while, the, constituents, of, table, salt, sodium, and, chloride, make, up, about, 85, percent, of, the, solids, in, solution, there, are, also, other, metal, ions, such, as, magnesium, and, calcium, and, negative, ions, including, sulphate, carbonate, and, bromide, despite, variations, in, the, levels, of, salinity, in, different, seas, the, relative, composition, of, the, dissolved, salts, is, stable, throughout, the, world, s, oceans, seawater, is, too, saline, for, humans, to, drink, safely, as, the, kidneys, cannot, excrete, urine, as, salty, as, seawater, although, the, amount, of, salt, in, the, ocean, remains, relatively, constant, within, the, scale, of, millions, of, years, various, factors, affect, the, salinity, of, a, body, of, water, evaporation, and, by, product, of, ice, formation, known, as, brine, rejection, increase, salinity, whereas, precipitation, sea, ice, melt, and, runoff, from, land, reduce, it, the, baltic, sea, for, example, has, many, rivers, flowing, into, it, and, thus, the, sea, could, be, considered, as, brackish, meanwhile, the, red, sea, is, very, salty, due, to, its, high, evaporation, rate, sea, temperature, depends, on, the, amount, of, solar, radiation, falling, on, its, surface, in, the, tropics, with, the, sun, nearly, overhead, the, temperature, of, the, surface, layers, can, rise, to, over, 30, c, 86, f, while, near, the, poles, the, temperature, in, equilibrium, with, the, sea, ice, is, about, 2, c, 28, f, there, is, a, continuous, circulation, of, water, in, the, oceans, warm, surface, currents, cool, as, they, move, away, from, the, tropics, and, the, water, becomes, denser, and, sinks, the, cold, water, moves, back, towards, the, equator, as, a, deep, sea, current, driven, by, changes, in, the, temperature, and, density, of, the, water, before, eventually, welling, up, again, towards, the, surface, deep, seawater, has, a, temperature, between, 2, c, 28, f, and, 5, c, 41, f, in, all, parts, of, the, globe, seawater, with, a, typical, salinity, of, 35, has, a, freezing, point, of, about, 1, 8, c, 28, 8, f, when, its, temperature, becomes, low, enough, ice, crystals, form, on, the, surface, these, break, into, small, pieces, and, coalesce, into, flat, discs, that, form, a, thick, suspension, known, as, frazil, in, calm, conditions, this, freezes, into, a, thin, flat, sheet, known, as, nilas, which, thickens, as, new, ice, forms, on, its, underside, in, more, turbulent, seas, frazil, crystals, join, into, flat, discs, known, as, pancakes, these, slide, under, each, other, and, coalesce, to, form, floes, in, the, process, of, freezing, salt, water, and, air, are, trapped, between, the, ice, crystals, nilas, may, have, a, salinity, of, 12, 15, but, by, the, time, the, sea, ice, is, one, year, old, this, falls, to, 4, 6, seawater, is, slightly, alkaline, and, had, an, average, ph, of, about, 8, 2, over, the, past, 300, million, years, more, recently, climate, change, has, resulted, in, an, increase, of, the, carbon, dioxide, content, of, the, atmosphere, about, 30, 40, of, the, added, co, 2, is, absorbed, by, the, oceans, forming, carbonic, acid, and, lowering, the, ph, now, below, 8, 1, through, a, process, called, ocean, acidification, the, extent, of, further, ocean, chemistry, changes, including, ocean, ph, will, depend, on, climate, change, mitigation, efforts, taken, by, nations, and, their, governments, the, amount, of, oxygen, found, in, seawater, depends, primarily, on, the, plants, growing, in, it, these, are, mainly, algae, including, phytoplankton, with, some, vascular, plants, such, as, seagrasses, in, daylight, the, photosynthetic, activity, of, these, plants, produces, oxygen, which, dissolves, in, the, seawater, and, is, used, by, marine, animals, at, night, photosynthesis, stops, and, the, amount, of, dissolved, oxygen, declines, in, the, deep, sea, where, insufficient, light, penetrates, for, plants, to, grow, there, is, very, little, dissolved, oxygen, in, its, absence, organic, material, is, broken, down, by, anaerobic, bacteria, producing, hydrogen, sulphide, climate, change, is, likely, to, reduce, levels, of, oxygen, in, surface, waters, since, the, solubility, of, oxygen, in, water, falls, at, higher, temperatures, ocean, deoxygenation, is, projected, to, increase, hypoxia, by, 10, and, triple, suboxic, waters, oxygen, concentrations, 98, less, than, the, mean, surface, concentrations, for, each, 1, c, of, upper, ocean, warming, the, amount, of, light, that, penetrates, the, sea, depends, on, the, angle, of, the, sun, the, weather, conditions, and, the, turbidity, of, the, water, much, light, gets, reflected, at, the, surface, and, red, light, gets, absorbed, in, the, top, few, metres, yellow, and, green, light, reach, greater, depths, and, blue, and, violet, light, may, penetrate, as, deep, as, 1, 000, metres, 3, 300, ft, there, is, insufficient, light, for, photosynthesis, and, plant, growth, beyond, a, depth, of, about, 200, metres, 660, ft, over, most, of, geologic, time, the, sea, level, has, been, higher, than, it, is, today, 74, the, main, factor, affecting, sea, level, over, time, is, the, result, of, changes, in, the, oceanic, crust, with, a, downward, trend, expected, to, continue, in, the, very, long, term, at, the, last, glacial, maximum, some, 20, 000, years, ago, the, sea, level, was, about, 125, metres, 410, ft, lower, than, in, present, times, 2012, for, at, least, the, last, 100, years, sea, level, has, been, rising, at, an, average, rate, of, about, 1, 8, millimetres, 0, 071, in, per, year, most, of, this, rise, can, be, attributed, to, an, increase, in, the, temperature, of, the, sea, due, to, climate, change, and, the, resulting, slight, thermal, expansion, of, the, upper, 500, metres, 1, 600, ft, of, water, additional, contributions, as, much, as, one, quarter, of, the, total, come, from, water, sources, on, land, such, as, melting, snow, and, glaciers, and, extraction, of, groundwater, for, irrigation, and, other, agricultural, and, human, needs, wind, blowing, over, the, surface, of, a, body, of, water, forms, waves, that, are, perpendicular, to, the, direction, of, the, wind, the, friction, between, air, and, water, caused, by, a, gentle, breeze, on, a, pond, causes, ripples, to, form, a, strong, blow, over, the, ocean, causes, larger, waves, as, the, moving, air, pushes, against, the, raised, ridges, of, water, the, waves, reach, their, maximum, height, when, the, rate, at, which, they, are, travelling, nearly, matches, the, speed, of, the, wind, in, open, water, when, the, wind, blows, continuously, as, happens, in, the, southern, hemisphere, in, the, roaring, forties, long, organised, masses, of, water, called, swell, roll, across, the, ocean, 83, 84, if, the, wind, dies, down, the, wave, formation, is, reduced, but, already, formed, waves, continue, to, travel, in, their, original, direction, until, they, meet, land, the, size, of, the, waves, depends, on, the, fetch, the, distance, that, the, wind, has, blown, over, the, water, and, the, strength, and, duration, of, that, wind, when, waves, meet, others, coming, from, different, directions, interference, between, the, two, can, produce, broken, irregular, seas, constructive, interference, can, cause, individual, unexpected, rogue, waves, much, higher, than, normal, most, waves, are, less, than, 3, m, 10, ft, high, and, it, is, not, unusual, for, strong, storms, to, double, or, triple, that, height, offshore, construction, such, as, wind, farms, and, oil, platforms, use, metocean, statistics, from, measurements, in, computing, the, wave, forces, due, to, for, instance, the, hundred, year, wave, they, are, designed, against, rogue, waves, however, have, been, documented, at, heights, above, 25, meters, 82, ft, the, top, of, a, wave, is, known, as, the, crest, the, lowest, point, between, waves, is, the, trough, and, the, distance, between, the, crests, is, the, wavelength, the, wave, is, pushed, across, the, surface, of, the, sea, by, the, wind, but, this, represents, a, transfer, of, energy, and, not, a, horizontal, movement, of, water, as, waves, approach, land, and, move, into, shallow, water, they, change, their, behavior, if, approaching, at, an, angle, waves, may, bend, refraction, or, wrap, rocks, and, headlands, diffraction, when, the, wave, reaches, a, point, where, its, deepest, oscillations, of, the, water, contact, the, seabed, they, begin, to, slow, down, this, pulls, the, crests, closer, together, and, increases, the, waves, height, which, is, called, wave, shoaling, when, the, ratio, of, the, wave, s, height, to, the, water, depth, increases, above, a, certain, limit, it, breaks, toppling, over, in, a, mass, of, foaming, water, this, rushes, in, a, sheet, up, the, beach, before, retreating, into, the, sea, under, the, influence, of, gravity, a, tsunami, is, an, unusual, form, of, wave, caused, by, an, infrequent, powerful, event, such, as, an, underwater, earthquake, or, landslide, a, meteorite, impact, a, volcanic, eruption, or, a, collapse, of, land, into, the, sea, these, events, can, temporarily, lift, or, lower, the, surface, of, the, sea, in, the, affected, area, usually, by, a, few, feet, the, potential, energy, of, the, displaced, seawater, is, turned, into, kinetic, energy, creating, a, shallow, wave, a, tsunami, radiating, outwards, at, a, velocity, proportional, to, the, square, root, of, the, depth, of, the, water, and, which, therefore, travels, much, faster, in, the, open, ocean, than, on, a, continental, shelf, in, the, deep, open, sea, tsunamis, have, wavelengths, of, around, 80, to, 300, miles, 130, to, 480, km, travel, at, speeds, of, over, 600, miles, per, hour, 970, km, h, and, usually, have, a, height, of, less, than, three, feet, so, they, often, pass, unnoticed, at, this, stage, in, contrast, ocean, surface, waves, caused, by, winds, have, wavelengths, of, a, few, hundred, feet, travel, at, up, to, 65, miles, per, hour, 105, km, h, and, are, up, to, 45, feet, 14, metres, high, as, a, tsunami, moves, into, shallower, water, its, speed, decreases, its, wavelength, shortens, and, its, amplitude, increases, enormously, behaving, in, the, same, way, as, a, wind, generated, wave, in, shallow, water, but, on, a, vastly, greater, scale, either, the, trough, or, the, crest, of, a, tsunami, can, arrive, at, the, coast, first, in, the, former, case, the, sea, draws, back, and, leaves, subtidal, areas, close, to, the, shore, exposed, which, provides, a, useful, warning, for, people, on, land, when, the, crest, arrives, it, does, not, usually, break, but, rushes, inland, flooding, all, in, its, path, much, of, the, destruction, may, be, caused, by, the, flood, water, draining, back, into, the, sea, after, the, tsunami, has, struck, dragging, debris, and, people, with, it, often, several, tsunami, are, caused, by, a, single, geological, event, and, arrive, at, intervals, of, between, eight, minutes, and, two, hours, the, first, wave, to, arrive, on, shore, may, not, be, the, biggest, or, most, destructive, wind, blowing, over, the, surface, of, the, sea, causes, friction, at, the, interface, between, air, and, sea, not, only, does, this, cause, waves, to, form, but, it, also, makes, the, surface, seawater, move, in, the, same, direction, as, the, wind, although, winds, are, variable, in, any, one, place, they, predominantly, blow, from, a, single, direction, and, thus, a, surface, current, can, be, formed, westerly, winds, are, most, frequent, in, the, mid, latitudes, while, easterlies, dominate, the, tropics, when, water, moves, in, this, way, other, water, flows, in, to, fill, the, gap, and, a, circular, movement, of, surface, currents, known, as, a, gyre, is, formed, there, are, five, main, gyres, in, the, world, s, oceans, two, in, the, pacific, two, in, the, atlantic, and, one, in, the, indian, ocean, other, smaller, gyres, are, found, in, lesser, seas, and, a, single, gyre, flows, around, antarctica, these, gyres, have, followed, the, same, routes, for, millennia, guided, by, the, topography, of, the, land, the, wind, direction, and, the, coriolis, effect, the, surface, currents, flow, in, a, clockwise, direction, in, the, northern, hemisphere, and, anticlockwise, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, water, moving, away, from, the, equator, is, warm, and, that, flowing, in, the, reverse, direction, has, lost, most, of, its, heat, these, currents, tend, to, moderate, the, earth, s, climate, cooling, the, equatorial, region, and, warming, regions, at, higher, latitudes, global, climate, and, weather, forecasts, are, powerfully, affected, by, the, world, ocean, so, global, climate, modelling, makes, use, of, ocean, circulation, models, as, well, as, models, of, other, major, components, such, as, the, atmosphere, land, surfaces, aerosols, and, sea, ice, ocean, models, make, use, of, a, branch, of, physics, geophysical, fluid, dynamics, that, describes, the, large, scale, flow, of, fluids, such, as, seawater, surface, currents, only, affect, the, top, few, hundred, metres, of, the, sea, but, there, are, also, large, scale, flows, in, the, ocean, depths, caused, by, the, movement, of, deep, water, masses, a, main, deep, ocean, current, flows, through, all, the, world, s, oceans, and, is, known, as, the, thermohaline, circulation, or, global, conveyor, belt, this, movement, is, slow, and, is, driven, by, differences, in, density, of, the, water, caused, by, variations, in, salinity, and, temperature, at, high, latitudes, the, water, is, chilled, by, the, low, atmospheric, temperature, and, becomes, saltier, as, sea, ice, crystallizes, out, both, these, factors, make, it, denser, and, the, water, sinks, from, the, deep, sea, near, greenland, such, water, flows, southwards, between, the, continental, landmasses, on, either, side, of, the, atlantic, when, it, reaches, the, antarctic, it, is, joined, by, further, masses, of, cold, sinking, water, and, flows, eastwards, it, then, splits, into, two, streams, that, move, northwards, into, the, indian, and, pacific, oceans, here, it, is, gradually, warmed, becomes, less, dense, rises, towards, the, surface, and, loops, back, on, itself, it, takes, a, thousand, years, for, this, circulation, pattern, to, be, completed, besides, gyres, there, are, temporary, surface, currents, that, occur, under, specific, conditions, when, waves, meet, a, shore, at, an, angle, a, longshore, current, is, created, as, water, is, pushed, along, parallel, to, the, coastline, the, water, swirls, up, onto, the, beach, at, right, angles, to, the, approaching, waves, but, drains, away, straight, down, the, slope, under, the, effect, of, gravity, the, larger, the, breaking, waves, the, longer, the, beach, and, the, more, oblique, the, wave, approach, the, stronger, is, the, longshore, current, these, currents, can, shift, great, volumes, of, sand, or, pebbles, create, spits, and, make, beaches, disappear, and, water, channels, silt, up, a, rip, current, can, occur, when, water, piles, up, near, the, shore, from, advancing, waves, and, is, funnelled, out, to, sea, through, a, channel, in, the, seabed, it, may, occur, at, a, gap, in, a, sandbar, or, near, a, man, made, structure, such, as, a, groyne, these, strong, currents, can, have, a, velocity, of, 3, ft, 0, 9, m, per, second, can, form, at, different, places, at, different, stages, of, the, tide, and, can, carry, away, unwary, bathers, temporary, upwelling, currents, occur, when, the, wind, pushes, water, away, from, the, land, and, deeper, water, rises, to, replace, it, this, cold, water, is, often, rich, in, nutrients, and, creates, blooms, of, phytoplankton, and, a, great, increase, in, the, productivity, of, the, sea, tides, are, the, regular, rise, and, fall, in, water, level, experienced, by, seas, and, oceans, in, response, to, the, gravitational, influences, of, the, moon, and, the, sun, and, the, effects, of, the, earth, s, rotation, during, each, tidal, cycle, at, any, given, place, the, water, rises, to, a, maximum, height, known, as, high, tide, before, ebbing, away, again, to, the, minimum, low, tide, level, as, the, water, recedes, it, uncovers, more, and, more, of, the, foreshore, also, known, as, the, intertidal, zone, the, difference, in, height, between, the, high, tide, and, low, tide, is, known, as, the, tidal, range, or, tidal, amplitude, most, places, experience, two, high, tides, each, day, occurring, at, intervals, of, about, 12, hours, and, 25, minutes, this, is, half, the, 24, hours, and, 50, minute, period, that, it, takes, for, the, earth, to, make, a, complete, revolution, and, return, the, moon, to, its, previous, position, relative, to, an, observer, the, moon, s, mass, is, some, 27, million, times, smaller, than, the, sun, but, it, is, 400, times, closer, to, the, earth, tidal, force, or, tide, raising, force, decreases, rapidly, with, distance, so, the, moon, has, more, than, twice, as, great, an, effect, on, tides, as, the, sun, a, bulge, is, formed, in, the, ocean, at, the, place, where, the, earth, is, closest, to, the, moon, because, it, is, also, where, the, effect, of, the, moon, s, gravity, is, stronger, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, earth, the, lunar, force, is, at, its, weakest, and, this, causes, another, bulge, to, form, as, the, moon, rotates, around, the, earth, so, do, these, ocean, bulges, move, around, the, earth, the, gravitational, attraction, of, the, sun, is, also, working, on, the, seas, but, its, effect, on, tides, is, less, powerful, than, that, of, the, moon, and, when, the, sun, moon, and, earth, are, all, aligned, full, moon, and, new, moon, the, combined, effect, results, in, the, high, spring, tides, in, contrast, when, the, sun, is, at, 90, from, the, moon, as, viewed, from, earth, the, combined, gravitational, effect, on, tides, is, less, causing, the, lower, neap, tides, a, storm, surge, can, occur, when, high, winds, pile, water, up, against, the, coast, in, a, shallow, area, and, this, coupled, with, a, low, pressure, system, can, raise, the, surface, of, the, sea, at, high, tide, dramatically, the, earth, is, composed, of, a, magnetic, central, core, a, mostly, liquid, mantle, and, a, hard, rigid, outer, shell, or, lithosphere, which, is, composed, of, the, earth, s, rocky, crust, and, the, deeper, mostly, solid, outer, layer, of, the, mantle, on, land, the, crust, is, known, as, the, continental, crust, while, under, the, sea, it, is, known, as, the, oceanic, crust, the, latter, is, composed, of, relatively, dense, basalt, and, is, some, five, to, ten, kilometres, three, to, six, miles, thick, the, relatively, thin, lithosphere, floats, on, the, weaker, and, hotter, mantle, below, and, is, fractured, into, a, number, of, tectonic, plates, in, mid, ocean, magma, is, constantly, being, thrust, through, the, seabed, between, adjoining, plates, to, form, mid, oceanic, ridges, and, here, convection, currents, within, the, mantle, tend, to, drive, the, two, plates, apart, parallel, to, these, ridges, and, nearer, the, coasts, one, oceanic, plate, may, slide, beneath, another, oceanic, plate, in, a, process, known, as, subduction, deep, trenches, are, formed, here, and, the, process, is, accompanied, by, friction, as, the, plates, grind, together, the, movement, proceeds, in, jerks, which, cause, earthquakes, heat, is, produced, and, magma, is, forced, up, creating, underwater, mountains, some, of, which, may, form, chains, of, volcanic, islands, near, to, deep, trenches, near, some, of, the, boundaries, between, the, land, and, sea, the, slightly, denser, oceanic, plates,

and, seismic, activity, the, earth, s, deepest, trench, is, the, mariana, trench, which, extends, for, about, 2, 500, kilometres, 1, 600, mi, across, the, seabed, it, is, near, the, mariana, islands, a, volcanic, archipelago, in, the, west, pacific, its, deepest, point, is, 10, 994, kilometres, nearly, 7, miles, below, the, surface, of, the, sea, the, zone, where, land, meets, sea, is, known, as, the, coast, and, the, part, between, the, lowest, spring, tides, and, the, upper, limit, reached, by, splashing, waves, is, the, shore, a, beach, is, the, accumulation, of, sand, or, shingle, on, the, shore, a, headland, is, a, point, of, land, jutting, out, into, the, sea, and, a, larger, promontory, is, known, as, a, cape, the, indentation, of, a, coastline, especially, between, two, headlands, is, a, bay, a, small, bay, with, a, narrow, inlet, is, a, cove, and, a, large, bay, may, be, referred, to, as, a, gulf, coastlines, are, influenced, by, several, factors, including, the, strength, of, the, waves, arriving, on, the, shore, the, gradient, of, the, land, margin, the, composition, and, hardness, of, the, coastal, rock, the, inclination, of, the, off, shore, slope, and, the, changes, of, the, level, of, the, land, due, to, local, uplift, or, submergence, normally, waves, roll, towards, the, shore, at, the, rate, of, six, to, eight, per, minute, and, these, are, known, as, constructive, waves, as, they, tend, to, move, material, up, the, beach, and, have, little, erosive, effect, storm, waves, arrive, on, shore, in, rapid, succession, and, are, known, as, destructive, waves, as, the, swash, moves, beach, material, seawards, under, their, influence, the, sand, and, shingle, on, the, beach, is, ground, together, and, abraded, around, high, tide, the, power, of, a, storm, wave, impacting, on, the, foot, of, a, cliff, has, a, shattering, effect, as, air, in, cracks, and, crevices, is, compressed, and, then, expands, rapidly, with, release, of, pressure, at, the, same, time, sand, and, pebbles, have, an, erosive, effect, as, they, are, thrown, against, the, rocks, this, tends, to, undercut, the, cliff, and, normal, weathering, processes, such, as, the, action, of, frost, follows, causing, further, destruction, gradually, a, wave, cut, platform, develops, at, the, foot, of, the, cliff, and, this, has, a, protective, effect, reducing, further, wave, erosion, material, worn, from, the, margins, of, the, land, eventually, ends, up, in, the, sea, here, it, is, subject, to, attrition, as, currents, flowing, parallel, to, the, coast, scour, out, channels, and, transport, sand, and, pebbles, away, from, their, place, of, origin, sediment, carried, to, the, sea, by, rivers, settles, on, the, seabed, causing, deltas, to, form, in, estuaries, all, these,

barrier, is, designed, to, protect, london, from, a, storm, surge, while, the, failure, of, the, dykes, and, levees, around, new, orleans, during, hurricane, katrina, created, a, humanitarian, crisis, in, the, united, states, the, sea, plays, a, part, in, the, water, or, hydrological, cycle, in, which, water, evaporates, from, the, ocean, travels, through, the, atmosphere, as, vapour, condenses, falls, as, rain, or, snow, thereby, sustaining, life, on, land, and, largely, returns, to, the, sea, even, in, the, atacama, desert, where, little, rain, ever, falls, dense, clouds, of, fog, known, as, the, camanchaca, blow, in, from, the, sea, and, support, plant, life, in, central, asia, and, other, large, land, masses, there, are, endorheic, basins, which, have, no, outlet, to, the, sea, separated, from, the, ocean, by, mountains, or, other, natural, geologic, features, that, prevent, the, water, draining, away, the, caspian, sea, is, the, largest, one, of, these, its, main, inflow,

pyramid, lake, in, the, western, united, states, are, further, examples, of, large, inland, saline, water, bodies, without, drainage, some, endorheic, lakes, are, less, salty, but, all, are, sensitive, to, variations, in, the, quality, of, the, inflowing, water, oceans, contain, the, greatest, quantity, of, actively, cycled, carbon, in, the, world, and, are, second, only, to, the, lithosphere, in, the, amount, of, carbon, they, store, the, oceans, surface, layer, holds, large, amounts, of, dissolved, organic, carbon, that, is, exchanged, rapidly, with, the, atmosphere, the, deep, layer, s, concentration, of, dissolved, inorganic, carbon, is, about, 15, percent, higher, than, that, of, the, surface, layer, and, it, remains, there, for, much, longer, periods, of, time, thermohaline, circulation, exchanges, carbon, between, these, two, layers, carbon, enters, the, ocean, as, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, dissolves, in, the, surface, layers, and, is, converted, into, carbonic, acid, carbonate, and, bicarbonate, it, can, also, enter, through, rivers, as, dissolved, organic, carbon, and, is, converted, by, photosynthetic, organisms, into, organic, carbon, this, can, either, be, exchanged, throughout, the, food, chain, or, precipitated, into, the, deeper, more, carbon, rich, layers, as, dead, soft, tissue, or, in, shells, and, bones, as, calcium, carbonate, it, circulates, in, this, layer, for, long, periods, of, time, before, either, being, deposited, as, sediment, or, being, returned, to, surface, waters, through, thermohaline, circulation, the, oceans, are, home, to, a, diverse, collection, of, life, forms, that, use, it, as, a, habitat, since, sunlight, illuminates, only, the, upper, layers, the, major, part, of, the, ocean, exists, in, permanent, darkness, as, the, different, depth, and, temperature, zones, each, provide, habitat, for, a, unique, set, of, species, the, marine, environment, as, a, whole, encompasses, an, immense, diversity, of, life, marine, habitats, range, from, surface, water, to, the, deepest, oceanic, trenches, including, coral, reefs, kelp, forests, seagrass, meadows, tidepools, muddy, sandy, and, rocky, seabeds, and, the, open, pelagic, zone, the, organisms, living, in, the, sea, range, from, whales, 30, metres, 98, feet, long, to, microscopic, phytoplankton, and, zooplankton, fungi, and, bacteria, marine, life, plays, an, important, part, in, the, carbon, cycle, as, photosynthetic, organisms, convert, dissolved, carbon, dioxide, into, organic, carbon, and, it, is, economically, important, to, humans, for, providing, fish, for, use, as, food, 204, 229, life, may, have, originated, in, the, sea, and, all, the, major, groups, of, animals, are, represented, there, scientists, differ, as, to, precisely, where, in, the, sea, life, arose, the, miller, urey, experiments, suggested, a, dilute, chemical, soup, in, open, water, but, more, recent, suggestions, include, volcanic, hot, springs, fine, grained, clay, sediments, or, deep, sea, black, smoker, vents, all, of, which, would, have, provided, protection, from, damaging, ultraviolet, radiation, which, was, not, blocked, by, the, early, earth, s, atmosphere, 138, 140, marine, habitats, can, be, divided, horizontally, into, coastal, and, open, ocean, habitats, coastal, habitats, extend, from, the, shoreline, to, the, edge, of, the, continental, shelf, most, marine, life, is, found, in, coastal, habitats, even, though, the, shelf, area, occupies, only, 7, percent, of, the, total, ocean, area, open, ocean, habitats, are, found, in, the, deep, ocean, beyond, the, edge, of, the, continental, shelf, alternatively, marine, habitats, can, be, divided, vertically, into, pelagic, open, water, demersal, just, above, the, seabed, and, benthic, sea, bottom, habitats, a, third, division, is, by, latitude, from, polar, seas, with, ice, shelves, sea, ice, and, icebergs, to, temperate, and, tropical, waters, 150, 151, coral, reefs, the, so, called, rainforests, of, the, sea, occupy, less, than, 0, 1, percent, of, the, world, s, ocean, surface, yet, their, ecosystems, include, 25, percent, of, all, marine, species, the, best, known, are, tropical, coral, reefs, such, as, australia, s, great, barrier, reef, but, cold, water, reefs, harbour, a, wide, array, of, species, including, corals, only, six, of, which, contribute, to, reef, formation, 204, 207, marine, primary, producers, plants, and, microscopic, organisms, in, the, plankton, are, widespread, and, very, essential, for, the, ecosystem, it, has, been, estimated, that, half, of, the, world, s, oxygen, is, produced, by, phytoplankton, about, 45, percent, of, the, sea, s, primary, production, of, living, material, is, contributed, by, diatoms, much, larger, algae, commonly, known, as, seaweeds, are, important, locally, sargassum, forms, floating, drifts, while, kelp, form, seabed, forests, 246, 255, flowering, plants, in, the, form, of, seagrasses, grow, in, meadows, in, sandy, shallows, mangroves, line, the, coast, in, tropical, and, subtropical, regions, and, salt, tolerant, plants, thrive, in, regularly, inundated, salt, marshes, all, of, these, habitats, are, able, to, sequester, large, quantities, of, carbon, and, support, a, biodiverse, range, of, larger, and, smaller, animal, life, light, is, only, able, to, penetrate, the, top, 200, metres, 660, ft, so, this, is, the, only, part, of, the, sea, where, plants, can, grow, the, surface, layers, are, often, deficient, in, biologically, active, nitrogen, compounds, the, marine, nitrogen, cycle, consists, of, complex, microbial, transformations, which, include, the, fixation, of, nitrogen, its, assimilation, nitrification, anammox, and, denitrification, some, of, these, processes, take, place, in, deep, water, so, that, where, there, is, an, upwelling, of, cold, waters, and, also, near, estuaries, where, land, sourced, nutrients, are, present, plant, growth, is, higher, this, means, that, the, most, productive, areas, rich, in, plankton, and, therefore, also, in, fish, are, mainly, coastal, 160, 163, there, is, a, broader, spectrum, of, higher, animal, taxa, in, the, sea, than, on, land, many, marine, species, have, yet, to, be, discovered, and, the, number, known, to, science, is, expanding, annually, some, vertebrates, such, as, seabirds, seals, and, sea, turtles, return, to, the, land, to, breed, but, fish, cetaceans, and, sea, snakes, have, a, completely, aquatic, lifestyle, and, many, invertebrate, phyla, are, entirely, marine, in, fact, the, oceans, teem, with, life, and, provide, many, varying, microhabitats, one, of, these, is, the, surface, film, which, even, though, tossed, about, by, the, movement, of, waves, provides, a, rich, environment, and, is, home, to, bacteria, fungi, microalgae, protozoa, fish, eggs, and, various, larvae, the, pelagic, zone, contains, macro, and, microfauna, and, myriad, zooplankton, which, drift, with, the, currents, most, of, the, smallest, organisms, are, the, larvae, of, fish, and, marine, invertebrates, which, liberate, eggs, in, vast, numbers, because, the, chance, of, any, one, embryo, surviving, to, maturity, is, so, minute, the, zooplankton, feed, on, phytoplankton, and, on, each, other, and, form, a, basic, part, of, the, complex, food, chain, that, extends, through, variously, sized, fish, and, other, nektonic, organisms, to, large, squid, sharks, porpoises, dolphins, and, whales, some, marine, creatures, make, large, migrations, either, to, other, regions, of, the, ocean, on, a, seasonal, basis, or, vertical, migrations, daily, often, ascending, to, feed, at, night, and, descending, to, safety, by, day, ships, can, introduce, or, spread, invasive, species, through, the, discharge, of, ballast, water, or, the, transport, of, organisms, that, have, accumulated, as, part, of, the, fouling, community, on, the, hulls, of, vessels, the, demersal, zone, supports, many, animals, that, feed, on, benthic, organisms, or, seek, protection, from, predators, and, the, seabed, provides, a, range, of, habitats, on, or, under, the, surface, of, the, substrate, which, are, used, by, creatures, adapted, to, these, conditions, the, tidal, zone, with, its, periodic, exposure, to, the, dehydrating, air, is, home, to, barnacles, molluscs, and, crustaceans, the, neritic, zone, has, many, organisms, that, need, light, to, flourish, here, among, algal, encrusted, rocks, live, sponges, echinoderms, polychaete, worms, sea, anemones, and, other, invertebrates, corals, often, contain, photosynthetic, symbionts, and, live, in, shallow, waters, where, light, penetrates, the, extensive, calcareous, skeletons, they, extrude, build, up, into, coral, reefs, which, are, an, important, feature, of, the, seabed, these, provide, a, biodiverse, habitat, for, reef, dwelling, organisms, there, is, less, sea, life, on, the, floor, of, deeper, seas, but, marine, life, also, flourishes, around, seamounts, that, rise, from, the, depths, where, fish, and, other, animals, congregate, to, spawn, and, feed, close, to, the, seabed, live, demersal, fish, that, feed, largely, on, pelagic, organisms, or, benthic, invertebrates, exploration, of, the, deep, sea, by, submersibles, revealed, a, new, world, of, creatures, living, on, the, seabed, that, scientists, had, not, previously, known, to, exist, some, like, the, detrivores, rely, on, organic, material, falling, to, the, ocean, floor, others, cluster, round, deep, sea, hydrothermal, vents, where, mineral, rich, flows, of, water, emerge, from, the, seabed, supporting, communities, whose, primary, producers, are, sulphide, oxidising, chemoautotrophic, bacteria, and, whose, consumers, include, specialised, bivalves, sea, anemones, barnacles, crabs, worms, and, fish, often, found, nowhere, else, 212, a, dead, whale, sinking, to, the, bottom, of, the, ocean, provides, food, for, an, assembly, of, organisms, which, similarly, rely, largely, on, the, actions, of, sulphur, reducing, bacteria, such, places, support, unique, biomes, where, many, new, microbes, and, other, lifeforms, have, been, discovered, humans, have, travelled, the, seas, since, they, first, built, sea, going, craft, mesopotamians, were, using, bitumen, to, caulk, their, reed, boats, and, a, little, later, masted, sails, by, c, 3000, bc, austronesians, on, taiwan, had, begun, spreading, into, maritime, southeast, asia, subsequently, the, austronesian, lapita, peoples, displayed, great, feats, of, navigation, reaching, out, from, the, bismarck, archipelago, to, as, far, away, as, fiji, tonga, and, samoa, their, descendants, continued, to, travel, thousands, of, miles, between, tiny, islands, on, outrigger, canoes, and, in, the, process, they, found, many, new, islands, including, hawaii, easter, island, rapa, nui, and, new, zealand, the, ancient, egyptians, and, phoenicians, explored, the, mediterranean, and, red, sea, with, the, egyptian, hannu, reaching, the, arabian, peninsula, and, the, african, coast, around, 2750, bc, in, the, first, millennium, bc, phoenicians, and, greeks, established, colonies, throughout, the, mediterranean, and, the, black, sea, around, 500, bc, the, carthaginian, navigator, hanno, left, a, detailed, periplus, of, an, atlantic, journey, that, reached, at, least, senegal, and, possibly, mount, cameroon, in, the, early, mediaeval, period, the, vikings, crossed, the, north, atlantic, and, even, reached, the, northeastern, fringes, of, north, america, novgorodians, had, also, been, sailing, the, white, sea, since, the, 13th, century, or, before, meanwhile, the, seas, along, the, eastern, and, southern, asian, coast, were, used, by, arab, and, chinese, traders, the, chinese, ming, dynasty, had, a, fleet, of, 317, ships, with, 37, 000, men, under, zheng, he, in, the, early, fifteenth, century, sailing, the, indian, and, pacific, oceans, 12, 13, in, the, late, fifteenth, century, western, european, mariners, started, making, longer, voyages, of, exploration, in, search, of, trade, bartolomeu, dias, rounded, the, cape, of, good, hope, in, 1487, and, vasco, da, gama, reached, india, via, the, cape, in, 1498, christopher, columbus, sailed, from, cadiz, in, 1492, attempting, to, reach, the, eastern, lands, of, india, and, japan, by, the, novel, means, of, travelling, westwards, he, made, landfall, instead, on, an, island, in, the, caribbean, sea, and, a, few, years, later, the, venetian, navigator, john, cabot, reached, newfoundland, the, italian, amerigo, vespucci, after, whom, america, was, named, explored, the, south, american, coastline, in, voyages, made, between, 1497, and, 1502, discovering, the, mouth, of, the, amazon, river, 12, 13, in, 1519, the, portuguese, navigator, ferdinand, magellan, led, the, spanish, magellan, elcano, expedition, which, would, be, the, first, to, sail, around, the, world, 12, 13, as, for, the, history, of, navigational, instrument, a, compass, was, first, used, by, the, ancient, greeks, and, chinese, to, show, where, north, lies, and, the, direction, in, which, the, ship, is, heading, the, latitude, an, angle, which, ranges, from, 0, at, the, equator, to, 90, at, the, poles, was, determined, by, measuring, the, angle, between, the, sun, moon, or, a, specific, star, and, the, horizon, by, the, use, of, an, astrolabe, jacob, s, staff, or, sextant, the, longitude, a, line, on, the, globe, joining, the, two, poles, could, only, be, calculated, with, an, accurate, chronometer, to, show, the, exact, time, difference, between, the, ship, and, a, fixed, point, such, as, the, greenwich, meridian, in, 1759, john, harrison, a, clockmaker, designed, such, an, instrument, and, james, cook, used, it, in, his, voyages, of, exploration, nowadays, the, global, positioning, system, gps, using, over, thirty, satellites, enables, accurate, navigation, worldwide, with, regards, to, maps, that, are, vital, for, navigation, in, the, second, century, ptolemy, mapped, the, whole, known, world, from, the, fortunatae, insulae, cape, verde, or, canary, islands, eastward, to, the, gulf, of, thailand, this, map, was, used, in, 1492, when, christopher, columbus, set, out, on, his, voyages, of, discovery, subsequently, gerardus, mercator, made, a, practical, map, of, the, world, in, 1538, his, map, projection, conveniently, making, rhumb, lines, straight, 12, 13, by, the, eighteenth, century, better, maps, had, been, made, and, part, of, the, objective, of, james, cook, on, his, voyages, was, to, further, map, the, ocean, scientific, study, has, continued, with, the, depth, recordings, of, the, tuscarora, the, oceanic, research, of, the, challenger, voyages, 1872, 1876, the, work, of, the, scandinavian, seamen, roald, amundsen, and, fridtjof, nansen, the, michael, sars, expedition, in, 1910, the, german, meteor, expedition, of, 1925, the, antarctic, survey, work, of, discovery, ii, in, 1932, and, others, since, furthermore, in, 1921, the, international, hydrographic, organization, iho, was, set, up, and, it, constitutes, the, world, authority, on, hydrographic, surveying, and, nautical, charting, a, fourth, edition, draft, was, published, in, 1986, but, so, far, several, naming, disputes, such, as, the, one, over, the, sea, of, japan, have, prevented, its, ratification, scientific, oceanography, began, with, the, voyages, of, captain, james, cook, from, 1768, to, 1779, describing, the, pacific, with, unprecedented, precision, from, 71, degrees, south, to, 71, degrees, north, 14, john, harrison, s, chronometers, supported, cook, s, accurate, navigation, and, charting, on, two, of, these, voyages, permanently, improving, the, standard, attainable, for,

thompson, became, chief, scientist, on, the, challenger, expedition, of, 1872, 1876, which, effectively, created, the, science, of, oceanography, 15, on, her, 68, 890, nautical, mile, 127, 580, km, journey, round, the, globe, hms, challenger, discovered, about, 4, 700, new, marine, species, and, made, 492, deep, sea, soundings, 133, bottom, dredges, 151, open, water, trawls, and, 263, serial, water, temperature, observations, in, the, southern, atlantic, in, 1898, 1899, carl, chun, on, the, valdivia, brought, many, new, life, forms, to, the, surface, from, depths, of, over, 4, 000, metres, 13, 000, ft, the, first, observations, of, deep, sea, animals, in, their, natural, environment, were, made, in, 1930, by, william, beebe, and, otis, barton, who, descended, to, 434, metres, 1, 424, ft, in, the, spherical, steel, bathysphere, this, was, lowered, by, cable, but, by, 1960, a, self, powered, submersible, trieste, developed, by, jacques, piccard, took, piccard, and, don, walsh, to, the, deepest, part, of, the, earth, s, oceans, the, mariana, trench, in, the, pacific, reaching, a, record, depth, of, about, 10, 915, metres, 35, 810, ft, a, feat, not, repeated, until, 2012, when,

sea, ports, and, in, the, first, millennium, bc, the, arabs, phoenicians, israelites, and, indians, traded, in, luxury, goods, such, as, spices, gold, and, precious, stones, the, phoenicians, were, noted, sea, traders, and, under, the, greeks, and, romans, commerce, continued, to, thrive, with, the, collapse, of, the, roman, empire, european, trade, dwindled, but, it, continued, to, flourish, among, the, kingdoms, of, africa, the, middle, east, india, china, and, southeastern, asia, from, the, 16th, to, the, 19th, centuries, over, a, period, of, 400, years, about, 12, 13, million, africans, were, shipped, across, the, atlantic, to, be, sold, as, slaves, in, the, americas, as, part, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, 194, large, quantities, of, goods, are, transported, by, sea, especially, across, the, atlantic, and, around, the, pacific, rim, a, major, trade, route, passes, through, the, pillars, of, hercules, across, the, mediterranean, and, the, suez, canal, to, the,

sand, and, gravel, other, cargo, such, as, manufactured, goods, is, usually, transported, within, standard, sized, lockable, containers, loaded, on, purpose, built, container, ships, at, dedicated, terminals, before, the, rise, of, containerization, in, the, 1960s, these, goods, were, loaded, transported, and, unloaded, piecemeal, as, break, bulk, cargo, containerization, greatly, increased, the, efficiency, and, decreased, the, cost, of, moving, goods, by, sea, and, was, a, major, factor, leading, to, the, rise, of, globalization, and, exponential, increases, in, international, trade, in, the, mid, to, late, 20th, century, fish, and, other, fishery, products, are, among, the, most, widely, consumed, sources, of, protein, and, other, essential, nutrients, in, 2009, 16, 6, of, the, world, s, intake, of, animal, protein, and, 6, 5, of, all, protein, consumed, came, from, fish, in, order, to, fulfill, this, need, coastal, countries, have, exploited, marine, resources, in, their, exclusive, economic, zone, although, fishing, vessels, are, increasingly, venturing, further, afield, to, exploit, stocks, in, international, waters, in, 2011, the, total, world, production, of, fish, including, aquaculture, was, estimated, to, be, 154, million, tonnes, of, which, most, was, for, human, consumption, the, harvesting, of, wild, fish, accounted, for, 90, 4, million, tonnes, while, annually, increasing, aquaculture, contributes, the, rest, the, north, west, pacific, is, by, far, the, most, productive, area, with, 20, 9, million, tonnes, 27, percent, of, the, global, marine, catch, in, 2010, in, addition, the, number, of, fishing, vessels, in, 2010, reached, 4, 36, million, whereas, the, number, of, people, employed, in, the, primary, sector, of, fish, production, in, the, same, year, amounted, to, 54, 8, million, modern, fishing, vessels, include, fishing, trawlers, with, a, small, crew, stern, trawlers, purse, seiners, long, line, factory, vessels, and, large, factory, ships, which, are, designed, to, stay, at, sea, for, weeks, processing, and, freezing, great, quantities, of, fish, the, equipment, used, to, capture, the, fish, may, be, purse, seines, other, seines, trawls, dredges, gillnets, and, long, lines, and, the, fish, species, most, frequently, targeted, are, herring, cod, anchovy, tuna, flounder, mullet, squid, and, salmon, overexploitation, has, become, a, serious, concern, it, does, not, only, cause, the, depletion, of, fish, stocks, but, also, substantially, reduce, the, size, of, predatory, fish, populations, it, has, been, estimated, that, industrialized, fisheries, typically, reduced, community, biomass, by, 80, within, 15, years, of, exploitation, in, order, to, avoid, overexploitation, many, countries, have, introduced, quotas, in, their, own, waters, however, recovery, efforts, often, entail, substantial, costs, to, local, economies, or, food, provision, artisan, fishing, methods, include, rod, and, line, harpoons, skin, diving, traps, throw, nets, and, drag, nets, traditional, fishing, boats, are, powered, by, paddle, wind, or, outboard, motors, and, operate, in, near, shore, waters, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, is, encouraging, the, development, of, local, fisheries, to, provide, food, security, to, coastal, communities, and, help, alleviate, poverty, about, 79, million, tonnes, 78m, long, tons, 87m, short, tons, of, food, and, non, food, products, were, produced, by, aquaculture, in, 2010, an, all, time, high, about, six, hundred, species, of, plants, and, animals, were, cultured, some, for, use, in, seeding, wild, populations, the, animals, raised, included, finfish, aquatic, reptiles, crustaceans, molluscs, sea, cucumbers, sea, urchins, sea, squirts, and, jellyfish, integrated, mariculture, has, the, advantage, that, there, is, a, readily, available, supply, of, planktonic, food, in, the, ocean, and, waste, is, removed, naturally, various, methods,

countries, there, is, great, potential, for, additional, algaculture, few, maritime, flowering, plants, are, widely, used, for, food, but, one, example, is, marsh, samphire, which, is, eaten, both, raw, and, cooked, a, major, difficulty, for, aquaculture, is, the, tendency, towards, monoculture, and, the, associated, risk, of, widespread, disease, aquaculture, is, also, associated, with, environmental, risks, for, instance, shrimp, farming, has, caused, the, destruction, of, important, mangrove, forests, throughout, southeast, asia, use, of, the, sea, for, leisure, developed, in, the, nineteenth, century, and, became, a, significant, industry, in, the, twentieth, century, maritime, leisure, activities, are, varied, and, include, beachgoing, cruising, yachting, powerboat, racing, and, fishing, commercially, organized, voyages, on, cruise, ships, and, trips, on, smaller, vessels, for, ecotourism, such, as, whale, watching, and, coastal, birdwatching, sea, bathing, became, the, vogue, in, europe, in, the, 18th, century, after, william, buchan, advocated, the, practice, for, health, reasons, surfing, is, a, sport, in, which, a, wave, is, ridden, by, a, surfer, with, or, without, a, surfboard, other, marine, water, sports, include, kite, surfing, where, a, power, kite, propels, a, rider, on, a, board, across, the, water, windsurfing, where, the, power, is, provided,

introduces, such, themes, as, storm, shipwreck, battle, hardship, disaster, the, dashing, of, hopes, and, death, 45, in, his, epic, poem, the, odyssey, written, in, the, eighth, century, bc, homer, describes, the, ten, year, voyage, of, the, greek, hero, odysseus, who, struggles, to, return, home, across, the, sea, s, many, hazards, after, the, war, described, in, the, iliad, the, sea, is, a, recurring, theme, in, the, haiku, poems, of, the, japanese, edo, period, poet, matsuo, bash, 1644, 1694, in, the, works, of, psychiatrist, carl, jung, the, sea, symbolizes, the, personal, and, the, collective, unconscious, in, dream, interpretation, the, depths, of, the, sea, symbolizing, the, depths, of, the, unconscious, mind, the, environmental, issues, that, affect, the, sea, can, loosely, be, grouped, into, those, that, stem, from, marine, pollution, from, over, exploitation, and, those, that, stem, from, climate, change, they, all, impact, marine, ecosystems, and, food, webs, and, may, result, in, consequences, as, yet, unrecognised, for, the, biodiversity, and, continuation, of, marine, life, forms, an, overview, of, environmental, issues, is, shown, below, many, substances, enter, the, sea, as, a, result, of, human, activities, combustion, products, are, transported, in, the, air, and, deposited, into, the, sea, by, precipitation, industrial, outflows, and, sewage, contribute, heavy, metals, pesticides, pcbs, disinfectants, household, cleaning, products, and, other, synthetic, chemicals, these, become, concentrated, in, the, surface, film, and, in, marine, sediment, especially, estuarine, mud, the, result, of, all, this, contamination, is, largely, unknown, because, of, the, large, number, of, substances, involved, and, the, lack, of, information, on, their, biological, effects, the, heavy, metals, of, greatest, concern, are, copper, lead, mercury, cadmium, and, zinc, which, may, be, bio, accumulated, by, marine, organisms, and, are, passed, up, the, food, chain, much, floating, plastic, rubbish, does, not, biodegrade, instead, disintegrating, over, time, and, eventually, breaking, down, to, the, molecular, level, rigid, plastics, may, float, for, years, in, the, centre, of, the, pacific, gyre, there, is, a, permanent, floating, accumulation, of, mostly, plastic, waste, and, there, is, a, similar, garbage, patch, in, the, atlantic, foraging, sea, birds, such, as, the, albatross, and, petrel, may, mistake, debris, for, food, and, accumulate, indigestible, plastic, in, their, digestive, systems, turtles, and, whales, have, been, found, with, plastic, bags, and, fishing, line, in, their, stomachs, microplastics, may, sink, threatening, filter, feeders, on, the, seabed, most, oil, pollution, in, the, sea, comes, from, cities, and, industry, oil, is, dangerous, for, marine, animals, it, can, clog, the, feathers, of, sea, birds, reducing, their, insulating, effect, and, the, birds, buoyancy, and, be, ingested, when, they, preen, themselves, in, an, attempt, to, remove, the, contaminant, marine, mammals, are, less, seriously, affected, but, may, be, chilled, through, the, removal, of, their, insulation, blinded, dehydrated, or, poisoned, benthic, invertebrates, are, swamped, when, the, oil, sinks, fish, are, poisoned, and, the, food, chain, is, disrupted, in, the, short, term, oil, spills, result, in, wildlife, populations, being, decreased, and, unbalanced, leisure, activities, being, affected, and, the, livelihoods, of, people, dependent, on, the, sea, being, devastated, the, marine, environment, has, self, cleansing, properties, and, naturally, occurring, bacteria, will, act, over, time, to, remove, oil, from, the, sea, in, the, gulf, of, mexico, where, oil, eating, bacteria, are, already, present, they, take, only, a, few, days, to, consume, spilt, oil, run, off, of, fertilisers, from, agricultural, land, is, a, major, source, of, pollution, in, some, areas, and, the, discharge, of, raw, sewage, has, a, similar, effect, the, extra, nutrients, provided, by, these, sources, can, cause, excessive, plant, growth, nitrogen, is, often, the, limiting, factor, in, marine, systems, and, with, added, nitrogen, algal, blooms, and, red, tides, can, lower, the, oxygen, level, of, the, water, and, kill, marine, animals, such, events, have, created, dead, zones, in, the, baltic, sea, and, the, gulf, of, mexico, some, algal, blooms, are, caused, by, cyanobacteria, that, make, shellfish, that, filter, feed, on, them, toxic, harming, animals, like, sea, otters, nuclear, facilities, too, can, pollute, the, irish, sea, was, contaminated, by, radioactive, caesium, 137, from, the, former, sellafield, nuclear, fuel, processing, plant, and, nuclear, accidents, may, also, cause, radioactive, material, to, seep, into, the, sea, as, did, the, disaster, at, the, fukushima, daiichi, nuclear, power, plant, in, 2011, the, dumping, of, waste, including, oil, noxious, liquids, sewage, and, garbage, at, sea, is, governed, by, international, law, the, london, convention, 1972, is, a, united, nations, agreement, to, control, ocean, dumping, which, had, been, ratified, by, 89, countries, by, 8, june, 2012, marpol, 73, 78, is, a, convention, to, minimize, pollution, of, the, seas, by, ships, by, may, 2013, 152, maritime, nations, had, ratified, marpol
