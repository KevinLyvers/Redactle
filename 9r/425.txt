mercury, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, hg, and, atomic, number, 80, it, is, also, known, as, quicksilver, and, was, formerly, named, hydrargyrum, h, a, d, r, r, d, r, m, hy, drar, j, r, m, from, the, greek, words, hydor, water, and, argyros, silver, from, which, its, chemical, symbol, is, derived, a, heavy, silvery, d, block, element, mercury, is, the, only, metallic, element, that, is, known, to, be, liquid, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, the, only, other, element, that, is, liquid, under, these, conditions, is, the, halogen, bromine, though, metals, such, as, caesium, gallium, and, rubidium, melt, just, above, room, temperature, mercury, occurs, in, deposits, throughout, the, world, mostly, as, cinnabar, mercuric, sulfide, the, red, pigment, vermilion, is, obtained, by, grinding, natural, cinnabar, or, synthetic, mercuric, sulfide, exposure, to, mercury, and, mercury, containing, organic, compounds, is, toxic, to, the, nervous, system, immune, system, and, kidneys, of, humans, and, other, animals, mercury, poisoning, can, result, from, exposure, to, water, soluble, forms, of, mercury, such, as, mercuric, chloride, or, methylmercury, either, directly, or, through, mechanisms, of, biomagnification, mercury, is, used, in, thermometers, barometers, manometers, sphygmomanometers, float, valves, mercury, switches, mercury, relays, fluorescent, lamps, and, other, devices, although, concerns, about, the, element, s, toxicity, have, led, to, the, phasing, out, of, such, mercury, containing, instruments, it, remains, in, use, in, scientific, research, applications, and, in, amalgam, for, dental, restoration, in, some, locales, it, is, also, used, in, fluorescent, lighting, electricity, passed, through, mercury, vapor, in, a, fluorescent, lamp, produces, short, wave, ultraviolet, light, which, then, causes, the, phosphor, in, the, tube, to, fluoresce, making, visible, light, mercury, is, a, heavy, silvery, white, metal, that, is, liquid, at, room, temperature, compared, to, other, metals, it, is, a, poor, conductor, of, heat, but, a, fair, conductor, of, electricity, it, has, a, melting, point, of, 38, 83, c, and, a, boiling, point, of, 356, 73, c, both, the, lowest, of, any, stable, metal, although, preliminary, experiments, on, copernicium, and, flerovium, have, indicated, that, they, have, even, lower, boiling, points, this, effect, is, due, to, lanthanide, contraction, and, relativistic, contraction, reducing, the, orbit, radius, of, the, outermost, electrons, and, thus, weakening, the, metallic, bonding, in, mercury, upon, freezing, the, volume, of, mercury, decreases, by, 3, 59, and, its, density, changes, from, 13, 69, g, cm, 3, when, liquid, to, 14, 184, g, cm, 3, when, solid, the, coefficient, of, volume, expansion, is, 181, 59, 10, 6, at, 0, c, 181, 71, 10, 6, at, 20, c, and, 182, 50, 10, 6, at, 100, c, per, c, solid, mercury, is, malleable, and, ductile, and, can, be, cut, with, a, knife, table, of, thermal, and, physical, properties, of, liquid, mercury, mercury, does, not, react, with, most, acids, such, as, dilute, sulfuric, acid, although, oxidizing, acids, such, as, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, and, nitric, acid, or, aqua, regia, dissolve, it, to, give, sulfate, nitrate, and, chloride, like, silver, mercury, reacts, with, atmospheric, hydrogen, sulfide, mercury, reacts, with, solid, sulfur, flakes, which, are, used, in, mercury, spill, kits, to, absorb, mercury, spill, kits, also, use, activated, carbon, and, powdered, zinc, mercury, dissolves, many, metals, such, as, gold, and, silver, to, form, amalgams, iron, is, an, exception, and, iron, flasks, have, traditionally, been, used, to, transport, the, material, several, other, first, row, transition, metals, with, the, exception, of, manganese, copper, and, zinc, are, also, resistant, in, forming, amalgams, other, elements, that, do, not, readily, form, amalgams, with, mercury, include, platinum, sodium, amalgam, is, a, common, reducing, agent, in, organic, synthesis, and, is, also, used, in, high, pressure, sodium, lamps, mercury, readily, combines, with, aluminium, to, form, a, mercury, aluminium, amalgam, when, the, two, pure, metals, come, into, contact, since, the, amalgam, destroys, the, aluminium, oxide, layer, which, protects, metallic, aluminium, from, oxidizing, in, depth, as, in, iron, rusting, even, small, amounts, of, mercury, can, seriously, corrode, aluminium, for, this, reason, mercury, is, not, allowed, aboard, an, aircraft, under, most, circumstances, because, of, the, risk, of, it, forming, an, amalgam, with, exposed, aluminium, parts, in, the, aircraft, mercury, embrittlement, is, the, most, common, type, of, liquid, metal, embrittlement, as, mercury, is, a, natural, component, of, some, hydrocarbon, reservoirs, and, will, come, into, contact, with, petroleum, processing, equipment, under, normal, conditions, there, are, seven, stable, isotopes, of, mercury, with, 202, hg, being, the, most, abundant, 29, 86, the, longest, lived, radioisotopes, are, 194, hg, with, a, half, life, of, 444, years, and, 203, hg, with, a, half, life, of, 46, 612, days, most, of, the, remaining, radioisotopes, have, half, lives, that, are, less, than, a, day, 206, hg, occurs, naturally, in, tiny, traces, as, an, intermediate, decay, product, of, 238, u, 199, hg, and, 201, hg, are, the, most, often, studied, nmr, active, nuclei, having, spins, of, 1, 2, and, 3, 2, respectively, hg, is, the, modern, chemical, symbol, for, mercury, it, is, an, abbreviation, of, hydrargyrum, a, romanized, form, of, the, ancient, greek, name, for, mercury, hydrargyros, hydrargyros, is, a, greek, compound, word, meaning, water, silver, from, hydr, the, root, of, hydor, water, and, argyros, silver, like, the, english, name, quicksilver, living, silver, this, name, was, due, to, mercury, s, liquid, and, shiny, properties, the, modern, english, name, mercury, comes, from, the, planet, mercury, in, medieval, alchemy, the, seven, known, metals, quicksilver, gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, and, tin, were, associated, with, the, seven, planets, quicksilver, was, associated, with, the, fastest, planet, which, had, been, named, after, the, roman, god, mercury, who, was, associated, with, speed, and, mobility, the, astrological, symbol, for, the, planet, became, one, of, the, alchemical, symbols, for, the, metal, and, mercury, became, an, alternative, name, for, the, metal, mercury, is, the, only, metal, for, which, the, alchemical, planetary, name, survives, as, it, was, decided, it, was, preferable, to, quicksilver, as, a, chemical, name, mercury, was, found, in, egyptian, tombs, that, date, from, 1500, bc, cinnabar, the, most, common, natural, source, of, mercury, has, been, in, use, since, the, neolithic, age, in, china, and, tibet, mercury, use, was, thought, to, prolong, life, heal, fractures, and, maintain, generally, good, health, although, it, is, now, known, that, exposure, to, mercury, vapor, leads, to, serious, adverse, health, effects, the, first, emperor, of, a, unified, china, q, n, sh, hu, ng, d, allegedly, buried, in, a, tomb, that, contained, rivers, of, flowing, mercury, on, a, model, of, the, land, he, ruled, representative, of, the, rivers, of, china, was, reportedly, killed, by, drinking, a, mercury, and, powdered, jade, mixture, formulated, by, qin, alchemists, intended, as, an, elixir, of, immortality, khumarawayh, ibn, ahmad, ibn, tulun, the, second, tulunid, ruler, of, egypt, r, 884, 896, known, for, his, extravagance, and, profligacy, reportedly, built, a, basin, filled, with, mercury, on, which, he, would, lie, on, top, of, air, filled, cushions, and, be, rocked, to, sleep, in, november, 2014, large, quantities, of, mercury, were, discovered, in, a, chamber, 60, feet, below, the, 1800, year, old, pyramid, known, as, the, temple, of, the, feathered, serpent, the, third, largest, pyramid, of, teotihuacan, mexico, along, with, jade, statues, jaguar, remains, a, box, filled, with, carved, shells, and, rubber, balls, aristotle, recounts, that, daedalus, made, a, wooden, statue, of, venus, move, by, pouring, quicksilver, in, its, interior, in, greek, mythology, daedalus, gave, the, appearance, of, voice, in, his, statues, using, quicksilver, the, ancient, greeks, used, cinnabar, mercury, sulfide, in, ointments, the, ancient, egyptians, and, the, romans, used, it, in, cosmetics, in, lamanai, once, a, major, city, of, the, maya, civilization, a, pool, of, mercury, was, found, under, a, marker, in, a, mesoamerican, ballcourt, by, 500, bc, mercury, was, used, to, make, amalgams, medieval, latin, amalgama, alloy, of, mercury, with, other, metals, alchemists, thought, of, mercury, as, the, first, matter, from, which, all, metals, were, formed, they, believed, that, different, metals, could, be, produced, by, varying, the, quality, and, quantity, of, sulfur, contained, within, the, mercury, the, purest, of, these, was, gold, and, mercury, was, called, for, in, attempts, at, the, transmutation, of, base, or, impure, metals, into, gold, which, was, the, goal, of, many, alchemists, the, mines, in, almad, n, spain, monte, amiata, italy, and, idrija, now, slovenia, dominated, mercury, production, from, the, opening, of, the, mine, in, almad, n, 2500, years, ago, until, new, deposits, were, found, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, mercury, is, an, extremely, rare, element, in, earth, s, crust, it, has, an, average, crustal, abundance, by, mass, of, only, 0, 08, parts, per, million, ppm, and, is, the, 66th, most, abundant, element, in, the, earth, s, crust, because, it, does, not, blend, geochemically, with, those, elements, that, constitute, the, majority, of, the, crustal, mass, mercury, ores, can, be, extraordinarily, concentrated, considering, the, element, s, abundance, in, ordinary, rock, the, richest, mercury, ores, contain, up, to, 2, 5, mercury, by, mass, and, even, the, leanest, concentrated, deposits, are, at, least, 0, 1, mercury, 12, 000, times, average, crustal, abundance, it, is, found, either, as, a, native, metal, rare, or, in, cinnabar, metacinnabar, sphalerite, corderoite, livingstonite, and, other, minerals, with, cinnabar, hgs, being, the, most, common, ore, mercury, ores, often, occur, in, hot, springs, or, other, volcanic, regions, beginning, in, 1558, with, the, invention, of, the, patio, process, to, extract, silver, from, ore, using, mercury, mercury, became, an, essential, resource, in, the, economy, of, spain, and, its, american, colonies, mercury, was, used, to, extract, silver, from, the, lucrative, mines, in, new, spain, and, peru, initially, the, spanish, crown, s, mines, in, almad, n, in, southern, spain, supplied, all, the, mercury, for, the, colonies, mercury, deposits, were, discovered, in, the, new, world, and, more, than, 100, 000, tons, of, mercury, were, mined, from, the, region, of, huancavelica, peru, over, the, course, of, three, centuries, following, the, discovery, of, deposits, there, in, 1563, the, patio, process, and, later, pan, amalgamation, process, continued, to, create, great, demand, for, mercury, to, treat, silver, ores, until, the, late, 19th, century, former, mines, in, italy, the, united, states, and, mexico, which, once, produced, a, large, proportion, of, the, world, supply, have, now, been, completely, mined, out, or, in, the, case, of, slovenia, idrija, and, spain, almad, n, shut, down, due, to, the, fall, of, the, price, of, mercury, nevada, s, mcdermitt, mine, the, last, mercury, mine, in, the, united, states, closed, in, 1992, the, price, of, mercury, has, been, highly, volatile, over, the, years, and, in, 2006, was, 650, per, 76, pound, 34, 46, kg, flask, mercury, is, extracted, by, heating, cinnabar, in, a, current, of, air, and, condensing, the, vapor, the, equation, for, this, extraction, is, in, 2020, china, was, the, top, producer, of, mercury, providing, 88, of, the, world, output, 2200, out, of, 2500, tonnes, followed, by, tajikistan, 178, t, russia, 50, t, and, mexico, 32, t, because, of, the, high, toxicity, of, mercury, both, the, mining, of, cinnabar, and, refining, for, mercury, are, hazardous, and, historic, causes, of, mercury, poisoning, in, china, prison, labor, was, used, by, a, private, mining, company, as, recently, as, the, 1950s, to, develop, new, cinnabar, mines, thousands, of, prisoners, were, used, by, the, luo, xi, mining, company, to, establish, new, tunnels, worker, health, in, functioning, mines, is, at, high, risk, a, newspaper, claimed, that, an, unidentified, european, union, directive, calling, for, energy, efficient, lightbulbs, to, be, made, mandatory, by, 2012, encouraged, china, to, re, open, cinnabar, mines, to, obtain, the, mercury, required, for, cfl, bulb, manufacture, environmental, dangers, have, been, a, concern, particularly, in, the, southern, cities, of, foshan, and, guangzhou, and, in, guizhou, province, in, the, southwest, abandoned, mercury, mine, processing, sites, often, contain, very, hazardous, waste, piles, of, roasted, cinnabar, calcines, water, run, off, from, such, sites, is, a, recognized, source, of, ecological, damage, former, mercury, mines, may, be, suited, for, constructive, re, use, for, example, in, 1976, santa, clara, county, california, purchased, the, historic, almaden, quicksilver, mine, and, created, a, county, park, on, the, site, after, conducting, extensive, safety, and, environmental, analysis, of, the, property, all, known, mercury, compounds, exhibit, one, of, two, positive, oxidation, states, i, and, ii, experiments, have, failed, to, unequivocally, demonstrate, any, higher, oxidation, states, both, the, claimed, 1976, electrosynthesis, of, an, unstable, hg, iii, species, and, 2007, cryogenic, isolation, of, hgf, 4, have, disputed, interpretations, and, remain, difficult, if, not, impossible, to, reproduce, unlike, its, lighter, neighbors, cadmium, and, zinc, mercury, usually, forms, simple, stable, compounds, with, metal, metal, bonds, most, mercury, i, compounds, are, diamagnetic, and, feature, the, dimeric, cation, hg, 2, 2, stable, derivatives, include, the, chloride, and, nitrate, treatment, of, hg, i, compounds, complexation, with, strong, ligands, such, as, sulfide, cyanide, etc, and, induces, disproportionation, to, hg, 2, and, elemental, mercury, mercury, i, chloride, a, colorless, solid, also, known, as, calomel, is, really, the, compound, with, the, formula, hg, 2, cl, 2, with, the, connectivity, cl, hg, hg, cl, it, reacts, with, chlorine, to, give, mercuric, chloride, which, resists, further, oxidation, mercury, i, hydride, a, colorless, gas, has, the, formula, hgh, containing, no, hg, hg, bond, however, the, gas, has, only, ever, been, observed, as, isolated, molecules, indicative, of, its, tendency, to, bond, to, itself, mercury, forms, mercury, polycations, which, consist, of, linear, chains, of, mercury, centers, capped, with, a, positive, charge, one, example, is, hg, 2, 3, asf, 6, 2, mercury, ii, is, the, most, common, oxidation, state, and, is, the, main, one, in, nature, as, well, all, four, mercuric, halides, are, known, and, have, been, demonstrated, to, form, linear, coordination, geometry, despite, mercury, s, tendency, to, form, tetrahedral, molecular, geometry, with, other, ligands, this, behavior, is, similar, to, the, ag, ion, the, best, known, mercury, halide, is, mercury, ii, chloride, an, easily, sublimating, white, solid, mercury, ii, oxide, the, main, oxide, of, mercury, arises, when, the, metal, is, exposed, to, air, for, long, periods, at, elevated, temperatures, it, reverts, to, the, elements, upon, heating, near, 400, c, as, was, demonstrated, by, joseph, priestley, in, an, early, synthesis, of, pure, oxygen, hydroxides, of, mercury, are, poorly, characterized, as, attempted, isolation, studies, of, mercury, ii, hydroxide, have, yielded, mercury, oxide, instead, being, a, soft, metal, mercury, forms, very, stable, derivatives, with, the, heavier, chalcogens, preeminent, is, mercury, ii, sulfide, hgs, which, occurs, in, nature, as, the, ore, cinnabar, and, is, the, brilliant, pigment, vermilion, like, zns, hgs, crystallizes, in, two, forms, the, reddish, cubic, form, and, the, black, zinc, blende, form, the, latter, sometimes, occurs, naturally, as, metacinnabar, mercury, ii, selenide, hgse, and, mercury, ii, telluride, hgte, are, also, known, these, as, well, as, various, derivatives, e, g, mercury, cadmium, telluride, and, mercury, zinc, telluride, being, semiconductors, useful, as, infrared, detector, materials, mercury, ii, salts, form, a, variety, of, complex, derivatives, with, ammonia, these, include, millon, s, base, hg, 2, n, the, one, dimensional, polymer, salts, of, hgnh, 2, n, and, fusible, white, precipitate, or, cl, 2, known, as, nessler, s, reagent, potassium, tetraiodomercurate, ii, hgi, 2, 4, is, still, occasionally, used, to, test, for, ammonia, owing, to, its, tendency, to, form, the, deeply, colored, iodide, salt, of, millon, s, base, mercury, fulminate, is, a, detonator, widely, used, in, explosives, organic, mercury, compounds, are, historically, important, but, are, of, little, industrial, value, in, the, western, world, mercury, ii, salts, are, a, rare, example, of, simple, metal, complexes, that, react, directly, with, aromatic, rings, organomercury, compounds, are, always, divalent, and, usually, two, coordinate, and, linear, geometry, unlike, organocadmium, and, organozinc, compounds, organomercury, compounds, do, not, react, with, water, they, usually, have, the, formula, hgr, 2, which, are, often, volatile, or, hgrx, which, are, often, solids, where, r, is, aryl, or, alkyl, and, x, is, usually, halide, or, acetate, methylmercury, a, generic, term, for, compounds, with, the, formula, ch, 3, hgx, is, a, dangerous, family, of, compounds, that, are, often, found, in, polluted, water, they, arise, by, a, process, known, as, biomethylation, mercury, is, used, primarily, for, the, manufacture, of, industrial, chemicals, or, for, electrical, and, electronic, applications, it, is, used, in, some, liquid, in, glass, thermometers, especially, those, used, to, measure, high, temperatures, a, still, increasing, amount, is, used, as, gaseous, mercury, in, fluorescent, lamps, while, most, of, the, other, applications, are, slowly, being, phased, out, due, to, health, and, safety, regulations, in, some, applications, mercury, is, replaced, with, less, toxic, but, considerably, more, expensive, galinstan, alloy, mercury, and, its, compounds, have, been, used, in, medicine, although, they, are, much, less, common, today, than, they, once, were, now, that, the, toxic, effects, of, mercury, and, its, compounds, are, more, widely, understood, an, example, of, the, early, therapeutic, application, of, mercury, of, was, published, in, 1787, by, james, lind, the, first, edition, of, the, merck, s, manual, 1899, featured, many, then, medically, relevant, mercuric, compounds, such, as, mercury, ammonium, chloride, yellow, mercury, proto, iodide, calomel, and, mercuric, chloride, among, others, mercury, in, the, form, of, one, of, its, common, ores, cinnabar, is, used, in, various, traditional, medicines, especially, in, traditional, chinese, medicine, review, of, its, safety, has, found, that, cinnabar, can, lead, to, significant, mercury, intoxication, when, heated, consumed, in, overdose, or, taken, long, term, and, can, have, adverse, effects, at, therapeutic, doses, though, effects, from, therapeutic, doses, are, typically, reversible, although, this, form, of, mercury, appears, to, be, less, toxic, than, other, forms, its, use, in, traditional, chinese, medicine, has, not, yet, been, justified, as, the, therapeutic, basis, for, the, use, of, cinnabar, is, not, clear, mercury, i, chloride, also, known, as, calomel, or, mercurous, chloride, has, been, used, in, traditional, medicine, as, a, diuretic, topical, disinfectant, and, laxative, mercury, ii, chloride, also, known, as, mercuric, chloride, or, corrosive, sublimate, was, once, used, to, treat, syphilis, along, with, other, mercury, compounds, although, it, is, so, toxic, that, sometimes, the, symptoms, of, its, toxicity, were, confused, with, those, of, the, syphilis, it, was, believed, to, treat, it, is, also, used, as, a, disinfectant, blue, mass, a, pill, or, syrup, in, which, mercury, is, the, main, ingredient, was, prescribed, throughout, the, 19th, century, for, numerous, conditions, including, constipation, depression, child, bearing, and, toothaches, in, the, early, 20th, century, mercury, was, administered, to, children, yearly, as, a, laxative, and, dewormer, and, it, was, used, in, teething, powders, for, infants, the, mercury, containing, organohalide, merbromin, sometimes, sold, as, mercurochrome, is, still, widely, used, but, has, been, banned, in, some, countries, such, as, the, u, s, mercury, is, an, ingredient, in, dental, amalgams, thiomersal, called, thimerosal, in, the, united, states, is, an, organic, compound, used, as, a, preservative, in, vaccines, although, this, use, is, in, decline, although, it, was, widely, speculated, that, this, mercury, based, preservative, could, cause, or, trigger, autism, in, children, no, evidence, supports, any, such, link, nevertheless, thiomersal, has, been, removed, from, or, reduced, to, trace, amounts, in, all, u, s, vaccines, recommended, for, children, 6, years, of, age, and, under, with, the, exception, of, the, inactivated, influenza, vaccine, merbromin, mercurochrome, another, mercury, compound, is, a, topical, antiseptic, used, for, minor, cuts, and, scrapes, in, some, countries, today, the, use, of, mercury, in, medicine, has, greatly, declined, in, all, respects, especially, in, developed, countries, mercury, is, still, used, in, some, diuretics, although, substitutes, such, as, thiazides, now, exist, for, most, therapeutic, uses, in, 2003, mercury, compounds, were, found, in, some, over, the, counter, drugs, including, topical, antiseptics, stimulant, laxatives, diaper, rash, ointment, eye, drops, and, nasal, sprays, the, fda, has, inadequate, data, to, establish, general, recognition, of, the, safety, and, effectiveness, of, the, mercury, ingredients, in, these, products, chlorine, is, produced, from, sodium, chloride, common, salt, nacl, using, electrolysis, to, separate, the, metallic, sodium, from, the, chlorine, gas, usually, the, salt, is, dissolved, in, water, to, produce, a, brine, by, products, of, any, such, chloralkali, process, are, hydrogen, h, 2, and, sodium, hydroxide, naoh, which, is, commonly, called, caustic, soda, or, lye, by, far, the, largest, use, of, mercury, in, the, late, 20th, century, was, in, the, mercury, cell, process, also, called, the, castner, kellner, process, where, metallic, sodium, is, formed, as, an, amalgam, at, a, cathode, made, from, mercury, this, sodium, is, then, reacted, with, water, to, produce, sodium, hydroxide, many, of, the, industrial, mercury, releases, of, the, 20th, century, came, from, this, process, although, modern, plants, claim, to, be, safe, in, this, regard, from, the, 1960s, onward, the, majority, of, industrial, plants, moved, away, from, mercury, cell, processes, towards, diaphragm, cell, technologies, to, produce, chlorine, though, 11, of, the, chlorine, made, in, the, united, states, was, still, produced, with, the, mercury, cell, method, as, of, 2005, thermometers, containing, mercury, were, invented, in, the, early, 18th, century, by, daniel, gabriel, fahrenheit, though, earlier, attempts, at, making, temperature, measuring, instruments, filled, with, quicksilver, had, been, described, in, the, 1650s, 23, fahrenheit, s, mercury, thermometer, was, based, on, an, earlier, design, that, used, alcohol, rather, than, mercury, the, mercury, thermometer, was, significantly, more, accurate, than, those, using, alcohol, from, the, early, 21st, century, onwards, the, use, of, mercury, thermometers, has, been, declining, and, mercury, containing, instruments, have, been, banned, in, many, jurisdictions, following, the, 1998, protocol, on, heavy, metals, modern, alternatives, to, mercury, thermometers, include, resistance, thermometers, thermocouples, and, thermistor, sensors, that, output, to, a, digital, display, some, transit, telescopes, use, a, basin, of, mercury, to, form, a, flat, and, absolutely, horizontal, mirror, useful, in, determining, an, absolute, vertical, or, perpendicular, reference, concave, horizontal, parabolic, mirrors, may, be, formed, by, rotating, liquid, mercury, on, a, disk, the, parabolic, form, of, the, liquid, thus, formed, reflecting, and, focusing, incident, light, such, liquid, mirror, telescopes, are, cheaper, than, conventional, large, mirror, telescopes, by, up, to, a, factor, of, 100, but, the, mirror, cannot, be, tilted, and, always, points, straight, up, liquid, mercury, is, part, of, a, popular, secondary, reference, electrode, called, the, calomel, electrode, in, electrochemistry, as, an, alternative, to, the, standard, hydrogen, electrode, the, calomel, electrode, is, used, to, work, out, the, electrode, potential, of, half, cells, the, triple, point, of, mercury, 38, 8344, c, is, a, fixed, point, used, as, a, temperature, standard, for, the, international, temperature, scale, its, 90, in, polarography, both, the, dropping, mercury, electrode, and, the, hanging, mercury, drop, electrode, use, elemental, mercury, this, use, allows, a, new, uncontaminated, electrode, to, be, available, for, each, measurement, or, each, new, experiment, mercury, containing, compounds, are, also, of, use, in, the, field, of, structural, biology, mercuric, compounds, such, as, mercury, ii, chloride, or, potassium, tetraiodomercurate, ii, can, be, added, to, protein, crystals, in, an, effort, to, create, heavy, atom, derivatives, that, can, be, used, to, solve, the, phase, problem, in, x, ray, crystallography, via, isomorphous, replacement, or, anomalous, scattering, methods, gaseous, mercury, is, used, in, mercury, vapor, lamps, and, some, neon, sign, type, advertising, signs, and, fluorescent, lamps, those, low, pressure, lamps, emit, very, spectrally, narrow, lines, which, are, traditionally, used, in, optical, spectroscopy, for, calibration, of, spectral, position, commercial, calibration, lamps, are, sold, for, this, purpose, reflecting, a, fluorescent, ceiling, light, into, a, spectrometer, is, a, common, calibration, practice, gaseous, mercury, is, also, found, in, some, electron, tubes, including, ignitrons, thyratrons, and, mercury, arc, rectifiers, it, is, also, used, in, specialist, medical, care, lamps, for, skin, tanning, and, disinfection, gaseous, mercury, is, added, to, cold, cathode, argon, filled, lamps, to, increase, the, ionization, and, electrical, conductivity, an, argon, filled, lamp, without, mercury, will, have, dull, spots, and, will, fail, to, light, correctly, lighting, containing, mercury, can, be, bombarded, oven, pumped, only, once, when, added, to, neon, filled, tubes, inconsistent, red, and, blue, spots, are, produced, in, the, light, emissions, until, the, initial, burning, in, process, is, completed, eventually, it, will, light, a, consistent, dull, off, blue, color, the, deep, space, atomic, clock, dsac, under, development, by, the, jet, propulsion, laboratory, utilises, mercury, in, a, linear, ion, trap, based, clock, the, novel, use, of, mercury, permits, the, creation, of, compact, atomic, clocks, with, low, energy, requirements, ideal, for, space, probes, and, mars, missions, mercury, is, effective, as, an, active, ingredient, in, skin, whitening, compounds, used, to, depigment, skin, the, minamata, convention, on, mercury, limits, the, concentration, of, mercury, in, such, whiteners, to, 1, part, per, million, however, as, of, 2022, many, commercially, sold, whitener, products, continue, to, exceed, that, limit, and, are, considered, toxic, mercury, ii, fulminate, is, a, primary, explosive, which, has, mainly, been, used, as, a, primer, of, a, cartridge, in, firearms, throughout, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, many, historic, applications, made, use, of, the, peculiar, physical, properties, of, mercury, especially, as, a, dense, liquid, and, a, liquid, metal, other, applications, made, use, of, the, chemical, properties, of, mercury, due, to, its, physical, properties, and, relative, chemical, inertness, liquid, mercury, is, absorbed, very, poorly, through, intact, skin, and, the, gastrointestinal, tract, mercury, vapor, is, the, primary, hazard, of, elemental, mercury, as, a, result, containers, of, mercury, are, securely, sealed, to, avoid, spills, and, evaporation, heating, of, mercury, or, of, compounds, of, mercury, that, may, decompose, when, heated, should, be, carried, out, with, adequate, ventilation, in, order, to, minimize, exposure, to, mercury, vapor, the, most, toxic, forms, of, mercury, are, its, organic, compounds, such, as, dimethylmercury, and, methylmercury, mercury, can, cause, both, chronic, and, acute, poisoning, preindustrial, deposition, rates, of, mercury, from, the, atmosphere, may, be, about, 4, ng, per, 1, l, of, ice, deposited, volcanic, eruptions, and, related, natural, sources, are, responsible, for, approximately, half, of, atmospheric, mercury, emissions, atmospheric, mercury, contamination, in, outdoor, urban, air, at, the, start, of, the, 21st, century, was, measured, at, 0, 01, 0, 02, g, m, 3, a, 2001, study, measured, mercury, levels, in, 12, indoor, sites, chosen, to, represent, a, cross, section, of, building, types, locations, and, ages, in, the, new, york, area, this, study, found, mercury, concentrations, significantly, elevated, over, outdoor, concentrations, at, a, range, of, 0, 0065, 0, 523, g, m, 3, the, average, was, 0, 069, g, m, 3, half, of, mercury, emissions, are, attributed, to, mankind, the, sources, can, be, divided, into, the, following, estimated, percentages, the, above, percentages, are, estimates, of, the, global, human, caused, mercury, emissions, in, 2000, excluding, biomass, burning, an, important, source, in, some, regions, a, serious, industrial, disaster, was, the, dumping, of, waste, mercury, compounds, into, minamata, bay, japan, between, 1932, and, 1968, it, is, estimated, that, over, 3, 000, people, suffered, various, deformities, severe, mercury, poisoning, symptoms, or, death, from, what, became, known, as, minamata, disease, china, is, estimated, to, produce, 50, of, the, mercury, emissions, most, of, which, result, from, the, production, of, vinyl, chloride, mercury, also, enters, into, the, environment, through, the, improper, disposal, of, mercury, containing, products, due, to, health, concerns, see, below, toxics, use, reduction, efforts, are, cutting, back, or, eliminating, mercury, in, such, products, for, example, the, amount, of, mercury, sold, in, thermostats, in, the, united, states, decreased, from, 14, 5, tons, in, 2004, to, 3, 9, tons, in, 2007, the, tobacco, plant, readily, absorbs, and, accumulates, heavy, metals, such, as, mercury, from, the, surrounding, soil, into, its, leaves, these, are, subsequently, inhaled, during, tobacco, smoking, while, mercury, is, a, constituent, of, tobacco, smoke, studies, have, largely, failed, to, discover, a, significant, correlation, between, smoking, and, mercury, uptake, by, humans, compared, to, sources, such, as, occupational, exposure, fish, consumption, and, amalgam, tooth, fillings, a, less, well, known, source, of, mercury, is, the, burning, of, joss, paper, which, is, a, common, tradition, practiced, in, asia, including, china, vietnam, hong, kong, thailand, taiwan, and, malaysia, mercury, spills, pose, an, immediate, threat, to, people, handling, the, material, in, addition, to, being, an, environmental, hazard, if, the, material, is, not, contained, properly, this, is, of, particular, concern, for, visible, mercury, or, mercury, in, liquid, state, as, its, unusual, appearance, and, behavior, for, a, metal, makes, it, an, attractive, nuisance, to, the, uninformed, procedures, have, been, developed, to, contain, mercury, spills, as, well, as, recommendations, on, appropriate, responses, based, on, the, conditions, of, a, spill, tracking, liquid, mercury, away, from, the, site, of, a, spill, is, a, major, concern, in, liquid, mercury, spills, regulations, emphasize, containment, of, the, visible, mercury, as, the, first, course, of, action, followed, by, monitoring, of, mercury, vapors, and, vapor, cleanup, several, products, are, sold, as, mercury, spill, adsorbents, ranging, from, metal, salts, to, polymers, and, zeolites, sediments, within, large, urban, industrial, estuaries, act, as, an, important, sink, for, point, source, and, diffuse, mercury, pollution, within, catchments, a, 2015, study, of, foreshore, sediments, from, the, thames, estuary, measured, total, mercury, at, 0, 01, to, 12, 07, mg, kg, with, mean, of, 2, 10, mg, kg, and, median, of, 0, 85, mg, kg, n, 351, the, highest, mercury, concentrations, were, shown, to, occur, in, and, around, the, city, of, london, in, association, with, fine, grain, muds, and, high, total, organic, carbon, content, the, strong, affinity, of, mercury, for, carbon, rich, sediments, has, also, been, observed, in, salt, marsh, sediments, of, the, river, mersey, with, a, mean, concentration, of, 2, mg, kg, up, to, 5, mg, kg, these, concentrations, are, far, higher, than, those, in, the, salt, marsh, river, creek, sediments, of, new, jersey, and, mangroves, of, southern, china, which, exhibit, low, mercury, concentrations, of, about, 0, 2, mg, kg, due, to, the, health, effects, of, mercury, exposure, industrial, and, commercial, uses, are, regulated, in, many, countries, the, world, health, organization, osha, and, niosh, all, treat, mercury, as, an, occupational, hazard, both, osha, and, niosh, among, other, regulatory, agencies, have, established, specific, occupational, exposure, limits, on, the, element, and, its, derivative, compounds, in, liquid, and, vapor, form, environmental, releases, and, disposal, of, mercury, are, regulated, in, the, u, s, primarily, by, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, fish, and, shellfish, have, a, natural, tendency, to, concentrate, mercury, in, their, bodies, often, in, the, form, of, methylmercury, a, highly, toxic, organic, compound, of, mercury, species, of, fish, that, are, high, on, the, food, chain, such, as, shark, swordfish, king, mackerel, bluefin, tuna, albacore, tuna, and, tilefish, contain, higher, concentrations, of, mercury, than, others, because, mercury, and, methylmercury, are, fat, soluble, they, primarily, accumulate, in, the, viscera, although, they, are, also, found, throughout, the, muscle, tissue, mercury, presence, in, fish, muscles, can, be, studied, using, non, lethal, muscle, biopsies, mercury, present, in, prey, fish, accumulates, in, the, predator, that, consumes, them, since, fish, are, less, efficient, at, depurating, than, accumulating, methylmercury, methylmercury, concentrations, in, the, fish, tissue, increase, over, time, thus, species, that, are, high, on, the, food, chain, amass, body, burdens, of, mercury, that, can, be, ten, times, higher, than, the, species, they, consume, this, process, is, called, biomagnification, mercury, poisoning, happened, this, way, in, minamata, japan, now, called, minamata, disease, some, facial, creams, contain, dangerous, levels, of, mercury, most, contain, comparatively, non, toxic, inorganic, mercury, but, products, containing, highly, toxic, organic, mercury, have, been, encountered, new, york, city, residents, have, been, found, to, be, exposed, to, significant, levels, of, inorganic, mercury, compounds, through, the, use, of, skin, care, products, toxic, effects, include, damage, to, the, brain, kidneys, and, lungs, mercury, poisoning, can, result, in, several, diseases, including, acrodynia, pink, disease, hunter, russell, syndrome, and, minamata, disease, symptoms, typically, include, sensory, impairment, vision, hearing, speech, disturbed, sensation, and, a, lack, of, coordination, the, type, and, degree, of, symptoms, exhibited, depend, upon, the, individual, toxin, the, dose, and, the, method, and, duration, of, exposure, case, control, studies, have, shown, effects, such, as, tremors, impaired, cognitive, skills, and, sleep, disturbance, in, workers, with, chronic, exposure, to, mercury, vapor, even, at, low, concentrations, in, the, range, 0, 7, 42, g, m, 3, a, study, has, shown, that, acute, exposure, 4, 8, hours, to, calculated, elemental, mercury, levels, of, 1, 1, to, 44, mg, m, 3, resulted, in, chest, pain, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, impairment, of, pulmonary, function, and, evidence, of, interstitial, pneumonitis, acute, exposure, to, mercury, vapor, has, been, shown, to, result, in, profound, central, nervous, system, effects, including, psychotic, reactions, characterized, by, delirium, hallucinations, and, suicidal, tendency, occupational, exposure, has, resulted, in, broad, ranging, functional, disturbance, including, erethism, irritability, excitability, excessive, shyness, and, insomnia, with, continuing, exposure, a, fine, tremor, develops, and, may, escalate, to, violent, muscular, spasms, tremor, initially, involves, the, hands, and, later, spreads, to, the, eyelids, lips, and, tongue, long, term, low, level, exposure, has, been, associated, with, more, subtle, symptoms, of, erethism, including, fatigue, irritability, loss, of, memory, vivid, dreams, and, depression, research, on, the, treatment, of, mercury, poisoning, is, limited, currently, available, drugs, for, acute, mercurial, poisoning, include, chelators, n, acetyl, d, l, penicillamine, nap, british, anti, lewisite, bal, 2, 3, dimercapto, 1, propanesulfonic, acid, dmps, and, dimercaptosuccinic, acid, dmsa, in, one, small, study, including, 11, construction, workers, exposed, to, elemental, mercury, patients, were, treated, with, dmsa, and, nap, chelation, therapy, with, both, drugs, resulted, in, the, mobilization, of, a, small, fraction, of, the, total, estimated, body, mercury, dmsa, was, able, to, increase, the, excretion, of, mercury, to, a, greater, extent, than, nap, 140, countries, agreed, in, the, minamata, convention, on, mercury, by, the, united, nations, environment, programme, unep, to, prevent, mercury, vapor, emissions, the, convention, was, signed, on, 10, october, 2013, in, the, united, states, the, environmental, protection, agency, is, charged, with, regulating, and, managing, mercury, contamination, several, laws, give, the, epa, this, authority, including, the, clean, air, act, the, clean, water, act, the, resource, conservation, and, recovery, act, and, the, safe, drinking, water, act, additionally, the, mercury, containing, and, rechargeable, battery, management, act, passed, in, 1996, phases, out, the, use, of, mercury, in, batteries, and, provides, for, the, efficient, and, cost, effective, disposal, of, many, types, of, used, batteries, north, america, contributed, approximately, 11, of, the, total, global, anthropogenic, mercury, emissions, in, 1995, the, united, states, clean, air, act, passed, in, 1990, put, mercury, on, a, list, of, toxic, pollutants, that, need, to, be, controlled, to, the, greatest, possible, extent, thus, industries, that, release, high, concentrations, of, mercury, into, the, environment, agreed, to, install, maximum, achievable, control, technologies, mact, in, march, 2005, the, epa, promulgated, a, regulation, that, added, power, plants, to, the, list, of, sources, that, should, be, controlled, and, instituted, a, national, cap, and, trade, system, states, were, given, until, november, 2006, to, impose, stricter, controls, but, after, a, legal, challenge, from, several, states, the, regulations, were, struck, down, by, a, federal, appeals, court, on, 8, february, 2008, the, rule, was, deemed, not, sufficient, to, protect, the, health, of, persons, living, near, coal, fired, power, plants, given, the, negative, effects, documented, in, the, epa, study, report, to, congress, of, 1998, however, newer, data, published, in, 2015, showed, that, after, introduction, of, the, stricter, controls, mercury, declined, sharply, indicating, that, the, clean, air, act, had, its, intended, impact, the, epa, announced, new, rules, for, coal, fired, power, plants, on, 22, december, 2011, cement, kilns, that, burn, hazardous, waste, are, held, to, a, looser, standard, than, are, standard, hazardous, waste, incinerators, in, the, united, states, and, as, a, result, are, a, disproportionate, source, of, mercury, pollution, in, the, european, union, the, directive, on, the, restriction, of, the, use, of, certain, hazardous, substances, in, electrical, and, electronic, equipment, see, rohs, bans, mercury, from, certain, electrical, and, electronic, products, and, limits, the, amount, of, mercury, in, other, products, to, less, than, 1000, ppm, there, are, restrictions, for, mercury, concentration, in, packaging, the, limit, is, 100, ppm, for, sum, of, mercury, lead, hexavalent, chromium, and, cadmium, and, batteries, the, limit, is, 5, ppm, in, july, 2007, the, european, union, also, banned, mercury, in, non, electrical, measuring, devices, such, as, thermometers, and, barometers, the, ban, applies, to, new, devices, only, and, contains, exemptions, for, the, health, care, sector, and, a, two, year, grace, period, for, manufacturers, of, barometers, norway, enacted, a, total, ban, on, the, use, of, mercury, in, the, manufacturing, and, import, export, of, mercury, products, effective, 1, january, 2008, in, 2002, several, lakes, in, norway, were, found, to, have, a, poor, state, of, mercury, pollution, with, an, excess, of, 1, g, g, of, mercury, in, their, sediment, in, 2008, norway, s, minister, of, environment, development, erik, solheim, said, mercury, is, among, the, most, dangerous, environmental, toxins, satisfactory, alternatives, to, hg, in, products, are, available, and, it, is, therefore, fitting, to, induce, a, ban, products, containing, mercury, were, banned, in, sweden, in, 2009, while, elemental, mercury, has, been, banned, from, manufacture, and, use, in, all, but, a, few, applications, such, as, certain, energy, saving, light, sources, and, amalgam, dental, fillings, in, denmark, since, 2008
