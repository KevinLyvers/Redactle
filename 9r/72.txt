in, physics, the, weber, v, e, b, w, b, r, vay, weh, b, r, symbol, wb, is, the, unit, of, magnetic, flux, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, the, unit, is, derived, through, faraday, s, law, of, induction, from, the, relationship, 1, wb, 1, v, s, volt, second, a, magnetic, flux, density, of, 1, wb, m, 2, one, weber, per, square, metre, is, one, tesla, the, weber, is, named, after, the, german, physicist, wilhelm, eduard, weber, 1804, 1891, the, weber, may, be, defined, in, terms, of, faraday, s, law, which, relates, a, changing, magnetic, flux, through, a, loop, to, the, electric, field, around, the, loop, a, change, in, flux, of, one, weber, per, second, will, induce, an, electromotive, force, of, one, volt, produce, an, electric, potential, difference, of, one, volt, across, two, open, circuited, terminals, officially, weber, unit, of, magnetic, flux, the, weber, is, the, magnetic, flux, that, linking, a, circuit, of, one, turn, would, produce, in, it, an, electromotive, force, of, 1, volt, if, it, were, reduced, to, zero, at, a, uniform, rate, in, 1, second, that, is, w, b, v, s, displaystyle, mathrm, wb, mathrm, v, cdot, mathrm, s, one, weber, is, also, the, total, magnetic, flux, across, a, surface, of, one, square, meter, perpendicular, to, a, magnetic, flux, density, of, one, tesla, that, is, w, b, t, m, 2, displaystyle, mathrm, wb, mathrm,

the, weber, is, used, in, the, definition, of, the, henry, as, 1, weber, per, ampere, and, consequently, can, be, expressed, as, the, product, of, those, units, w, b, h, a, displaystyle, mathrm, wb,

named, for, a, person, its, symbol, starts, with, an, upper, case, letter, wb, but, when, written, in, full, it, follows, the, rules, for, capitalisation, of, a, common, noun, i, e, weber, becomes, capitalised, at, the, beginning, of, a, sentence, and, in, titles, but, is, otherwise, in, lower, case, in, 1861, the, british, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, known, as, the, ba, established, a, committee, under, william, thomson, later, lord, kelvin, to, study, electrical, units, in, a, february, 1902, manuscript, with, handwritten, notes, of, oliver, heaviside, giovanni, giorgi, proposed, a, set, of, rational, units, of, electromagnetism, including, the, weber, noting, that, the, product, of, the, volt, into, the, second, has, been, called, the, weber, by, the, b, a, the, international, electrotechnical, commission, began, work, on, terminology, in, 1909, and, established, technical, committee, 1, in, 1911, its, oldest, established, committee, to, sanction, the, terms, and, definitions, used, in, the, different, electrotechnical, fields, and, to, determine, the, equivalence, of, the, terms, used, in, the, different, languages, it, was, not, until, 1927, that, tc1, dealt, with, the, study, of, various, outstanding, problems, concerning, electrical, and, magnetic, quantities, and, units, discussions, of, a, theoretical, nature, were, opened, at, which, eminent, electrical, engineers, and, physicists, considered, whether, magnetic, field, strength, and, magnetic, flux, density, were, in, fact, quantities, of, the, same, nature, as, disagreement, continued, the, iec, decided, on, an, effort, to, remedy, the, situation, it, instructed, a, task, force, to, study, the, question, in, readiness, for, the, next, meeting, in, 1930, tc1, decided, that, the, magnetic, field, strength, h, is, of, a, different, nature, from, the, magnetic, flux, density, b, and, took, up, the, question, of, naming, the, units, for, these, fields, and, related, quantities, among, them, the, integral, of, magnetic, flux, density, in, 1935, tc, 1, recommended, names, for, several, electrical, units, including, the, weber, for, the, practical, unit, of, magnetic, flux, and, the, maxwell, for, the, cgs, unit, it, was, decided, to, extend, the, existing, series, of, practical, units, into, a, complete, comprehensive, system, of, physical, units, the, recommendation, being, adopted, in, 1935, that, the, system, with, four, fundamental, units, proposed, by, professor, giorgi, be, adopted, subject, to, the, fourth, fundamental, unit, being, eventually, selected, this, system, was, given, the, designation, of, giorgi, system, also, in, 1935, tc1, passed, responsibility, for, electric, and, magnetic, magnitudes, and, units, to, the, new, tc24, this, led, eventually, to, the, universal, adoption, of, the, giorgi, system, which, unified, electromagnetic, units, with, the, mks, dimensional, system, of, units, the, whole, now, known, simply, as, the, si, system, syst, me, international, d, unit, s, in, 1938, tc24, recommended, as, a, connecting, link, the, permeability, of, free, space, with, the, value, of, 0, 4, 10, 7, h, m, this, group, also, recognized, that, any, one, of, the, practical, units, already, in, use, ohm, ampere, volt, henry, farad, coulomb, and, weber, could, equally, serve, as, the, fourth, fundamental, unit, after, consultation, the, ampere, was, adopted, as, the, fourth, unit, of, the, giorgi, system, in, paris, in, 1950, like, other, si, units, the, weber, can, modified, by, adding, a, prefix, that, multiplies, it, by, a, power, of, 10
