the, oil, drop, experiment, was, performed, by, robert, a, millikan, and, harvey, fletcher, in, 1909, to, measure, the, elementary, electric, charge, the, charge, of, the, electron, the, experiment, took, place, in, the, ryerson, physical, laboratory, at, the, university, of, chicago, millikan, received, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 1923, the, experiment, entailed, observing, tiny, electrically, charged, droplets, of, oil, located, between, two, parallel, metal, surfaces, forming, the, plates, of, a, capacitor, the, plates, were, oriented, horizontally, with, one, plate, above, the, other, a, mist, of, atomized, oil, drops, was, introduced, through, a, small, hole, in, the, top, plate, and, was, ionized, by, x, rays, making, them, negatively, charged, first, with, zero, applied, electric, field, the, velocity, of, a, falling, droplet, was, measured, at, terminal, velocity, the, drag, force, equals, the, gravitational, force, as, both, forces, depend, on, the, radius, in, different, ways, the, radius, of, the, droplet, and, therefore, the, mass, and, gravitational, force, could, be, determined, using, the, known, density, of, the, oil, next, a, voltage, inducing, an, electric, field, was, applied, between, the, plates, and, adjusted, until, the, drops, were, suspended, in, mechanical, equilibrium, indicating, that, the, electrical, force, and, the, gravitational, force, were, in, balance, using, the, known, electric, field, millikan, and, fletcher, could, determine, the, charge, on, the, oil, droplet, by, repeating, the, experiment, for, many, droplets, they, confirmed, that, the, charges, were, all, small, integer, multiples, of, a, certain, base, value, which, was, found, to, be, 1, 5924, 17, 10, 19, c, about, 0, 6, difference, from, the, currently, accepted, value, of, 1, 602, 176, 634, 10, 19, c, they, proposed, that, this, was, the, magnitude, of, the, negative, charge, of, a, single, electron, starting, in, 1908, while, a, professor, at, the, university, of, chicago, millikan, with, the, significant, input, of, fletcher, the, able, assistance, of, mr, j, yinbong, lee, and, after, improving, his, setup, published, his, seminal, study, in, 1913, this, remains, controversial, since, papers, found, after, fletcher, s, death, describe, events, in, which, millikan, coerced, fletcher, into, relinquishing, authorship, as, a, condition, for, receiving, his, phd, in, return, millikan, used, his, influence, in, support, of, fletcher, s, career, at, bell, labs, millikan, and, fletcher, s, experiment, involved, measuring, the, force, on, oil, droplets, in, a, glass, chamber, sandwiched, between, two, electrodes, one, above, and, one, below, with, the, electrical, field, calculated, they, could, measure, the, droplet, s, charge, the, charge, on, a, single, electron, being, 1, 592, 10, 19, c, at, the, time, of, millikan, and, fletcher, s, oil, drop, experiments, the, existence, of, subatomic, particles, was, not, universally, accepted, experimenting, with, cathode, rays, in, 1897, j, j, thomson, had, discovered, negatively, charged, corpuscles, as, he, called, them, with, a, mass, about, 1, 1837, that, of, a, hydrogen, atom, similar, results, had, been, found, by, george, fitzgerald, and, walter, kaufmann, most, of, what, was, then, known, about, electricity, and, magnetism, however, could, be, explained, on, the, basis, that, charge, is, a, continuous, variable, in, much, the, same, way, that, many, of, the, properties, of, light, can, be, explained, by, treating, it, as, a, continuous, wave, rather, than, as, a, stream, of, photons, the, elementary, charge, e, is, one, of, the, fundamental, physical, constants, and, thus, the, accuracy, of, the, value, is, of, great, importance, in, 1923, millikan, won, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, part, because, of, this, experiment, thomas, edison, who, had, previously, thought, of, charge, as, a, continuous, variable, became, convinced, after, working, with, millikan, and, fletcher, s, apparatus, this, experiment, has, since, been, repeated, by, generations, of, physics, students, although, it, is, rather, expensive, and, difficult, to, conduct, properly, from, 1995, to, 2007, several, computer, automated, experiments, have, been, conducted, at, slac, to, search, for, isolated, fractionally, charged, particles, however, no, evidence, for, fractional, charge, particles, has, been, found, after, measuring, over, 100, million, drops, millikan, s, and, fletcher, s, apparatus, incorporated, a, parallel, pair, of, horizontal, metal, plates, by, applying, a, potential, difference, across, the, plates, a, uniform, electric, field, was, created, in, the, space, between, them, a, ring, of, insulating, material, was, used, to, hold, the, plates, apart, four, holes, were, cut, into, the, ring, three, for, illumination, by, a, bright, light, and, another, to, allow, viewing, through, a, microscope, a, fine, mist, of, oil, droplets, was, sprayed, into, a, chamber, above, the, plates, the, oil, was, of, a, type, usually, used, in, vacuum, apparatus, and, was, chosen, because, it, had, an, extremely, low, vapour, pressure, ordinary, oils, would, evaporate, under, the, heat, of, the, light, source, causing, the, mass, of, the, oil, drop, to, change, over, the, course, of, the, experiment, some, oil, drops, became, electrically, charged, through, friction, with, the, nozzle, as, they, were, sprayed, alternatively, charging, could, be, brought, about, by, including, an, ionizing, radiation, source, such, as, an, x, ray, tube, the, droplets, entered, the, space, between, the, plates, and, because, they, were, charged, could, be, made, to, rise, and, fall, by, changing, the, voltage, across, the, plates, initially, the, oil, drops, are, allowed, to, fall, between, the, plates, with, the, electric, field, turned, off, they, very, quickly, reach, a, terminal, velocity, because, of, friction, with, the, air, in, the, chamber, the, field, is, then, turned, on, and, if, it, is, large, enough, some, of, the, drops, the, charged, ones, will, start, to, rise, this, is, because, the, upwards, electric, force, f, e, is, greater, for, them, than, the, downwards, gravitational, force, f, g, in, the, same, way, bits, of, paper, can, be, picked, by, a, charged, rubber, rod, a, likely, looking, drop, is, selected, and, kept, in, the, middle, of, the, field, of, view, by, alternately, switching, off, the, voltage, until, all, the, other, drops, have, fallen, the, experiment, is, then, continued, with, this, one, drop, the, drop, is, allowed, to, fall, and, its, terminal, velocity, v, 1, in, the, absence, of, an, electric, field, is, calculated, the, drag, force, acting, on, the, drop, can, then, be, worked, out, using, stokes, law, where, v, 1, is, the, terminal, velocity, i, e, velocity, in, the, absence, of, an, electric, field, of, the, falling, drop, is, the, viscosity, of, the, air, and, r, is, the, radius, of, the, drop, the, weight, w, is, the, volume, d, multiplied, by, the, density, and, the, acceleration, due, to, gravity, g, however, what, is, needed, is, the, apparent, weight, the, apparent, weight, in, air, is, the, true, weight, minus, the, upthrust, which, equals, the, weight, of, air, displaced, by, the, oil, drop, for, a, perfectly, spherical, droplet, the, apparent, weight, can, be, written, as, at, terminal, velocity, the, oil, drop, is, not, accelerating, therefore, the, total, force, acting, on, it, must, be, zero, and, the, two, forces, f, and, w, displaystyle, w, must, cancel, one, another, out, that, is, f, w, displaystyle, f, w, this, implies, once, r, is, calculated, w, displaystyle, w, can, easily, be, worked, out, now, the, field, is, turned, back, on, and, the, electric, force, on, the, drop, is, where, q, is, the, charge, on, the, oil, drop, and, e, is, the, electric, field, between, the, plates, for, parallel, plates, where, v, is, the, potential, difference, and, d, is, the, distance, between, the, plates, one, conceivable, way, to, work, out, q, would, be, to, adjust, v, until, the, oil, drop, remained, steady, then, we, could, equate, f, e, with, w, displaystyle, w, also, determining, f, e, proves, difficult, because, the, mass, of, the, oil, drop, is, difficult, to, determine, without, reverting, to, the, use, of, stokes, law, a, more, practical, approach, is, to, turn, v, up, slightly, so, that, the, oil, drop, rises, with, a, new, terminal, velocity, v, 2, then, some, controversy, was, raised, by, physicist, gerald, holton, 1978, who, pointed, out, that, millikan, recorded, more, measurements, in, his, journal, than, he, included, in, his, final, results, holton, suggested, these, data, points, were, omitted, from, the, large, set, of, oil, drops, measured, in, his, experiments, without, apparent, reason, this, claim, was, disputed, by, allan, franklin, a, high, energy, physics, experimentalist, and, philosopher, of, science, at, the, university, of, colorado, franklin, contended, that, millikan, s, exclusions, of, data, did, not, substantively, affect, his, final, value, of, e, but, did, reduce, the, statistical, error, around, this, estimate, e, this, enabled, millikan, to, claim, that, he, had, calculated, e, to, better, than, one, half, of, one, percent, in, fact, if, millikan, had, included, all, of, the, data, he, had, thrown, out, the, standard, error, of, the, mean, would, have, been, within, 2, while, this, would, still, have, resulted, in, millikan, having, measured, e, better, than, anyone, else, at, the, time, the, slightly, larger, uncertainty, might, have, allowed, more, disagreement, with, his, results, within, the, physics, community, while, franklin, left, his, support, for, millikan, s, measurement, with, the, conclusion, that, concedes, that, millikan, may, have, performed, cosmetic, surgery, on, the, data, david, goodstein, investigated, the, original, detailed, notebooks, kept, by, millikan, concluding, that, millikan, plainly, states, here, and, in, the, reports, that, he, included, only, drops, that, had, undergone, a, complete, series, of, observations, and, excluded, no, drops, from, this, group, of, complete, measurements, reasons, for, a, failure, to, generate, a, complete, observation, include, annotations, regarding, the, apparatus, setup, oil, drop, production, and, atmospheric, effects, which, invalidated, in, millikan, s, opinion, borne, out, by, the, reduced, error, in, this, set, a, given, particular, measurement, in, a, commencement, address, given, at, the, california, institute, of, technology, caltech, in, 1974, and, reprinted, in, surely, you, re, joking, mr, feynman, in, 1985, as, well, as, in, the, pleasure, of, finding, things, out, in, 1999, physicist, richard, feynman, noted, we, have, learned, a, lot, from, experience, about, how, to, handle, some, of, the, ways, we, fool, ourselves, one, example, millikan, measured, the, charge, on, an, electron, by, an, experiment, with, falling, oil, drops, and, got, an, answer, which, we, now, know, not, to, be, quite, right, it, s, a, little, bit, off, because, he, had, the, incorrect, value, for, the, viscosity, of, air, it, s, interesting, to, look, at, the, history, of, measurements, of, the, charge, of, an, electron, after, millikan, if, you, plot, them, as, a, function, of, time, you, find, that, one, is, a, little, bit, bigger, than, millikan, s, and, the, next, one, s, a, little, bit, bigger, than, that, and, the, next, one, s, a, little, bit, bigger, than, that, until, finally, they, settle, down, to, a, number, which, is, higher, why, didn, t, they, discover, the, new, number, was, higher, right, away, it, s, a, thing, that, scientists, are, ashamed, of, this, history, because, it, s, apparent, that, people, did, things, like, this, when, they, got, a, number, that, was, too, high, above, millikan, s, they, thought, something, must, be, wrong, and, they, would, look, for, and, find, a, reason, why, something, might, be, wrong, when, they, got, a, number, close, to, millikan, s, value, they, didn, t, look, so, hard, and, so, they, eliminated, the, numbers, that, were, too, far, off, and, did, other, things, like, that, effective, from, the, 2019, revision, of, the, si, the, value, of, the, elementary, charge, is, defined, to, be, exactly, 1, 602, 176, 634, 10, 19, c, before, that, the, most, recent, 2014, accepted, value, was, 1, 602, 176, 6208, 98, 10, 19, c, where, the, 98, indicates, the, uncertainty, of, the, last, two, decimal, places, in, his, nobel, lecture, millikan, gave, his, measurement, as, 4, 774, 5, 10, 10, statc, which, equals, 1, 5924, 17, 10, 19, c, the, difference, is, less, than, one, percent, but, is, six, times, greater, than, millikan, s, standard, error, so, the, disagreement, is, significant, using, x, ray, experiments, erik, b, cklin, in, 1928, found, a, higher, value, of, the, elementary, charge, 4, 793, 0, 015, 10, 10, statc, or, 1, 5987, 0, 005, 10, 19, c, which, is, within, uncertainty, of, the, exact, value, raymond, thayer, birge, conducting, a, review, of, physical, constants, in, 1929, stated, the, investigation, by, b, cklin, constitutes, a, pioneer, piece, of, work, and, it, is, quite, likely, as, such, to, contain, various, unsuspected, sources, of, systematic, error, if, weighted, according, to, the, apparent, probable, error, the, weighted, average, will, still, be, suspiciously, high, the, writer, has, finally, decided, to, reject, the, b, cklin, value, and, to, use, the, weighted, mean, of, the, remaining, two, values, birge, averaged, millikan, s, result, and, a, different, less, accurate, x, ray, experiment, that, agreed, with, millikan, s, result, successive, x, ray, experiments, continued, to, give, high, results, and, proposals, for, the, discrepancy, were, ruled, out, experimentally, sten, von, friesen, measured, the, value, with, a, new, electron, diffraction, method, and, the, oil, drop, experiment, was, redone, both, gave, high, numbers, by, 1937, it, was, quite, obvious, that, millikan, s, value, could, not, be, maintained, any, longer, and, the, established, value, became, 4, 800, 0, 005, 10, 10, statc, or, 1, 6011, 0, 0017, 10, 19, c
