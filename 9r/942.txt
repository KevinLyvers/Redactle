mechanics, from, ancient, greek, m, khanik, lit, of, machines, is, the, area, of, physics, concerned, with, the, relationships, between, force, matter, and, motion, among, physical, objects, forces, applied, to, objects, result, in, displacements, which, are, changes, of, an, object, s, position, relative, to, its, environment, theoretical, expositions, of, this, branch, of, physics, has, its, origins, in, ancient, greece, for, instance, in, the, writings, of, aristotle, and, archimedes, see, history, of, classical, mechanics, and, timeline, of, classical, mechanics, during, the, early, modern, period, scientists, such, as, galileo, galilei, johannes, kepler, christiaan, huygens, and, isaac, newton, laid, the, foundation, for, what, is, now, known, as, classical, mechanics, as, a, branch, of, classical, physics, mechanics, deals, with, bodies, that, are, either, at, rest, or, are, moving, with, velocities, significantly, less, than, the, speed, of, light, it, can, also, be, defined, as, the, physical, science, that, deals, with, the, motion, of, and, forces, on, bodies, not, in, the, quantum, realm, the, ancient, greek, philosophers, were, among, the, first, to, propose, that, abstract, principles, govern, nature, the, main, theory, of, mechanics, in, antiquity, was, aristotelian, mechanics, though, an, alternative, theory, is, exposed, in, the, pseudo, aristotelian, mechanical, problems, often, attributed, to, one, of, his, successors, there, is, another, tradition, that, goes, back, to, the, ancient, greeks, where, mathematics, is, used, more, extensively, to, analyze, bodies, statically, or, dynamically, an, approach, that, may, have, been, stimulated, by, prior, work, of, the, pythagorean, archytas, examples, of, this, tradition, include, pseudo, euclid, on, the, balance, archimedes, on, the, equilibrium, of, planes, on, floating, bodies, hero, mechanica, and, pappus, collection, book, viii, in, the, middle, ages, aristotle, s, theories, were, criticized, and, modified, by, a, number, of, figures, beginning, with, john, philoponus, in, the, 6th, century, a, central, problem, was, that, of, projectile, motion, which, was, discussed, by, hipparchus, and, philoponus, persian, islamic, polymath, ibn, s, n, published, his, theory, of, motion, in, the, book, of, healing, 1020, he, said, that, an, impetus, is, imparted, to, a, projectile, by, the, thrower, and, viewed, it, as, persistent, requiring, external, forces, such, as, air, resistance, to, dissipate, it, ibn, sina, made, distinction, between, force, and, inclination, called, mayl, and, argued, that, an, object, gained, mayl, when, the, object, is, in, opposition, to, its, natural, motion, so, he, concluded, that, continuation, of, motion, is, attributed, to, the, inclination, that, is, transferred, to, the, object, and, that, object, will, be, in, motion, until, the, mayl, is, spent, he, also, claimed, that, a, projectile, in, a, vacuum, would, not, stop, unless, it, is, acted, upon, consistent, with, newton, s, first, law, of, motion, on, the, question, of, a, body, subject, to, a, constant, uniform, force, the, 12th, century, jewish, arab, scholar, hibat, allah, abu, l, barakat, al, baghdaadi, born, nathanel, iraqi, of, baghdad, stated, that, constant, force, imparts, constant, acceleration, according, to, shlomo, pines, al, baghdaadi, s, theory, of, motion, was, the, oldest, negation, of, aristotle, s, fundamental, dynamic, law, anticipation, in, a, vague, fashion, of, the, fundamental, law, of, classical, mechanics, influenced, by, earlier, writers, such, as, ibn, sina, and, al, baghdaadi, the, 14th, century, french, priest, jean, buridan, developed, the, theory, of, impetus, which, later, developed, into, the, modern, theories, of, inertia, velocity, acceleration, and, momentum, this, work, and, others, was, developed, in, 14th, century, england, by, the, oxford, calculators, such, as, thomas, bradwardine, who, studied, and, formulated, various, laws, regarding, falling, bodies, the, concept, that, the, main, properties, of, a, body, are, uniformly, accelerated, motion, as, of, falling, bodies, was, worked, out, by, the, 14th, century, oxford, calculators, two, central, figures, in, the, early, modern, age, are, galileo, galilei, and, isaac, newton, galileo, s, final, statement, of, his, mechanics, particularly, of, falling, bodies, is, his, two, new, sciences, 1638, newton, s, 1687, philosophi, naturalis, principia, mathematica, provided, a, detailed, mathematical, account, of, mechanics, using, the, newly, developed, mathematics, of, calculus, and, providing, the, basis, of, newtonian, mechanics, there, is, some, dispute, over, priority, of, various, ideas, newton, s, principia, is, certainly, the, seminal, work, and, has, been, tremendously, influential, and, many, of, the, mathematics, results, therein, could, not, have, been, stated, earlier, without, the, development, of, the, calculus, however, many, of, the, ideas, particularly, as, pertain, to, inertia, and, falling, bodies, had, been, developed, by, prior, scholars, such, as, christiaan, huygens, and, the, less, known, medieval, predecessors, precise, credit, is, at, times, difficult, or, contentious, because, scientific, language, and, standards, of, proof, changed, so, whether, medieval, statements, are, equivalent, to, modern, statements, or, sufficient, proof, or, instead, similar, to, modern, statements, and, hypotheses, is, often, debatable, two, main, modern, developments, in, mechanics, are, general, relativity, of, einstein, and, quantum, mechanics, both, developed, in, the, 20th, century, based, in, part, on, earlier, 19th, century, ideas, the, development, in, the, modern, continuum, mechanics, particularly, in, the, areas, of, elasticity, plasticity, fluid, dynamics, electrodynamics, and, thermodynamics, of, deformable, media, started, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, often, used, term, body, needs, to, stand, for, a, wide, assortment, of, objects, including, particles, projectiles, spacecraft, stars, parts, of, machinery, parts, of, solids, parts, of, fluids, gases, and, liquids, etc, other, distinctions, between, the, various, sub, disciplines, of, mechanics, concern, the, nature, of, the, bodies, being, described, particles, are, bodies, with, little, known, internal, structure, treated, as, mathematical, points, in, classical, mechanics, rigid, bodies, have, size, and, shape, but, retain, a, simplicity, close, to, that, of, the, particle, adding, just, a, few, so, called, degrees, of, freedom, such, as, orientation, in, space, otherwise, bodies, may, be, semi, rigid, i, e, elastic, or, non, rigid, i, e, fluid, these, subjects, have, both, classical, and, quantum, divisions, of, study, for, instance, the, motion, of, a, spacecraft, regarding, its, orbit, and, attitude, rotation, is, described, by, the, relativistic, theory, of, classical, mechanics, while, the, analogous, movements, of, an, atomic, nucleus, are, described, by, quantum, mechanics, the, following, are, the, three, main, designations, consisting, of, various, subjects, that, are, studied, in, mechanics, note, that, there, is, also, the, theory, of, fields, which, constitutes, a, separate, discipline, in, physics, formally, treated, as, distinct, from, mechanics, whether, it, be, classical, fields, or, quantum, fields, but, in, actual, practice, subjects, belonging, to, mechanics, and, fields, are, closely, interwoven, thus, for, instance, forces, that, act, on, particles, are, frequently, derived, from, fields, electromagnetic, or, gravitational, and, particles, generate, fields, by, acting, as, sources, in, fact, in, quantum, mechanics, particles, themselves, are, fields, as, described, theoretically, by, the, wave, function, the, following, are, described, as, forming, classical, mechanics, the, following, are, categorized, as, being, part, of, quantum, mechanics, historically, classical, mechanics, had, been, around, for, nearly, a, quarter, millennium, before, quantum, mechanics, developed, classical, mechanics, originated, with, isaac, newton, s, laws, of, motion, in, philosophi, naturalis, principia, mathematica, developed, over, the, seventeenth, century, quantum, mechanics, developed, later, over, the, nineteenth, century, precipitated, by, planck, s, postulate, and, albert, einstein, s, explanation, of, the, photoelectric, effect, both, fields, are, commonly, held, to, constitute, the, most, certain, knowledge, that, exists, about, physical, nature, classical, mechanics, has, especially, often, been, viewed, as, a, model, for, other, so, called, exact, sciences, essential, in, this, respect, is, the, extensive, use, of, mathematics, in, theories, as, well, as, the, decisive, role, played, by, experiment, in, generating, and, testing, them, quantum, mechanics, is, of, a, bigger, scope, as, it, encompasses, classical, mechanics, as, a, sub, discipline, which, applies, under, certain, restricted, circumstances, according, to, the, correspondence, principle, there, is, no, contradiction, or, conflict, between, the, two, subjects, each, simply, pertains, to, specific, situations, the, correspondence, principle, states, that, the, behavior, of, systems, described, by, quantum, theories, reproduces, classical, physics, in, the, limit, of, large, quantum, numbers, i, e, if, quantum, mechanics, is, applied, to, large, systems, for, e, g, a, baseball, the, result, would, almost, be, the, same, if, classical, mechanics, had, been, applied, quantum, mechanics, has, superseded, classical, mechanics, at, the, foundation, level, and, is, indispensable, for, the, explanation, and, prediction, of, processes, at, the, molecular, atomic, and, sub, atomic, level, however, for, macroscopic, processes, classical, mechanics, is, able, to, solve, problems, which, are, unmanageably, difficult, mainly, due, to, computational, limits, in, quantum, mechanics, and, hence, remains, useful, and, well, used, modern, descriptions, of, such, behavior, begin, with, a, careful, definition, of, such, quantities, as, displacement, distance, moved, time, velocity, acceleration, mass, and, force, until, about, 400, years, ago, however, motion, was, explained, from, a, very, different, point, of, view, for, example, following, the, ideas, of, greek, philosopher, and, scientist, aristotle, scientists, reasoned, that, a, cannonball, falls, down, because, its, natural, position, is, in, the, earth, the, sun, the, moon, and, the, stars, travel, in, circles, around, the, earth, because, it, is, the, nature, of, heavenly, objects, to, travel, in, perfect, circles, often, cited, as, father, to, modern, science, galileo, brought, together, the, ideas, of, other, great, thinkers, of, his, time, and, began, to, calculate, motion, in, terms, of, distance, travelled, from, some, starting, position, and, the, time, that, it, took, he, showed, that, the, speed, of, falling, objects, increases, steadily, during, the, time, of, their, fall, this, acceleration, is, the, same, for, heavy, objects, as, for, light, ones, provided, air, friction, air, resistance, is, discounted, the, english, mathematician, and, physicist, isaac, newton, improved, this, analysis, by, defining, force, and, mass, and, relating, these, to, acceleration, for, objects, traveling, at, speeds, close, to, the, speed, of, light, newton, s, laws, were, superseded, by, albert, einstein, s, theory, of, relativity, for, atomic, and, subatomic, particles, newton, s, laws, were, superseded, by, quantum, theory, for, everyday, phenomena, however, newton, s, three, laws, of, motion, remain, the, cornerstone, of, dynamics, which, is, the, study, of, what, causes, motion, akin, to, the, distinction, between, quantum, and, classical, mechanics, albert, einstein, s, general, and, special, theories, of, relativity, have, expanded, the, scope, of, newton, and, galileo, s, formulation, of, mechanics, the, differences, between, relativistic, and, newtonian, mechanics, become, significant, and, even, dominant, as, the, velocity, of, a, body, approaches, the, speed, of, light, for, instance, in, newtonian, mechanics, the, kinetic, energy, of, a, free, particle, is, e, 1, 2, mv, 2, whereas, in, relativistic, mechanics, it, is, e, 1, mc, 2, where, is, the, lorentz, factor, this, formula, reduces, to, the, newtonian, expression, in, the, low, energy, limit, for, high, energy, processes, quantum, mechanics, must, be, adjusted, to, account, for, special, relativity, this, has, led, to, the, development, of, quantum, field, theory
