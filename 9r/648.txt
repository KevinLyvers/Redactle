https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast
a, coast, also, called, the, coastline, shoreline, or, seashore, is, the, land, next, to, the, sea, or, the, line, that, forms, the, boundary, between, the, land, and, the, ocean, or, a, lake, coasts, are, influenced, by, the, topography, of, the, surrounding, landscape, as, well, as, by, water, induced, erosion, such, as, waves, the, geological, composition, of, rock, and, soil, dictates, the, type, of, shore, that, is, created, earth, contains, roughly, 620, 000, km, 390, 000, mi, of, coastline, coasts, are, important, zones, in, natural, ecosystems, often, home, to, a, wide, range, of, biodiversity, on, land, they, harbor, important, ecosystems, such, as, freshwater, or, estuarine, wetlands, which, are, important, for, bird, populations, and, other, terrestrial, animals, in, wave, protected, areas, they, harbor, salt, marshes, mangroves, or, seagrasses, all, of, which, can, provide, nursery, habitat, for, fin, fish, shellfish, and, other, aquatic, animals, rocky, shores, are, usually, found, along, exposed, coasts, and, provide, habitat, for, a, wide, range, of, sessile, animals, e, g, mussels, starfish, barnacles, and, various, kinds, of, seaweeds, in, physical, oceanography, a, shore, is, the, wider, fringe, that, is, geologically, modified, by, the, action, of, the, body, of, water, past, and, present, while, the, beach, is, at, the, edge, of, the, shore, representing, the, intertidal, zone, where, there, is, one, along, tropical, coasts, with, clear, nutrient, poor, water, coral, reefs, can, often, be, found, between, depths, of, 1, 50, m, 3, 3, 164, 0, ft, according, to, an, atlas, prepared, by, the, united, nations, about, 44, of, the, human, population, lives, within, 150, km, 93, mi, of, the, sea, as, of, 2013, due, to, its, importance, in, society, and, its, high, population, concentrations, the, coast, is, important, for, major, parts, of, the, global, food, and, economic, system, and, they, provide, many, ecosystem, services, to, humankind, for, example, important, human, activities, happen, in, port, cities, coastal, fisheries, commercial, recreational, and, subsistence, and, aquaculture, are, major, economic, activities, and, create, jobs, livelihoods, and, protein, for, the, majority, of, coastal, human, populations, other, coastal, spaces, like, beaches, and, seaside, resorts, generate, large, revenues, through, tourism, marine, coastal, ecosystems, can, also, provide, protection, against, sea, level, rise, and, tsunamis, in, many, countries, mangroves, are, the, primary, source, of, wood, for, fuel, e, g, charcoal, and, building, material, coastal, ecosystems, like, mangroves, and, seagrasses, have, a, much, higher, capacity, for, carbon, sequestration, than, many, terrestrial, ecosystems, and, as, such, can, play, a, critical, role, in, the, near, future, to, help, mitigate, climate, change, effects, by, uptake, of, atmospheric, anthropogenic, carbon, dioxide, however, the, economic, importance, of, coasts, makes, many, of, these, communities, vulnerable, to, climate, change, which, causes, increases, in, extreme, weather, and, sea, level, rise, as, well, as, related, issues, like, coastal, erosion, saltwater, intrusion, and, coastal, flooding, other, coastal, issues, such, as, marine, pollution, marine, debris, coastal, development, and, marine, ecosystem, destruction, further, complicate, the, human, uses, of, the, coast, and, threaten, coastal, ecosystems, the, interactive, effects, of, climate, change, habitat, destruction, overfishing, and, water, pollution, especially, eutrophication, have, led, to, the, demise, of, coastal, ecosystem, around, the, globe, this, has, resulted, in, population, collapse, of, fisheries, stocks, loss, of, biodiversity, increased, invasion, of, alien, species, and, loss, of, healthy, habitats, international, attention, to, these, issues, has, been, captured, in, sustainable, development, goal, 14, life, below, water, which, sets, goals, for, international, policy, focused, on, preserving, marine, coastal, ecosystems, and, supporting, more, sustainable, economic, practices, for, coastal, communities, likewise, the, united, nations, has, declared, 2021, 2030, the, un, decade, on, ecosystem, restoration, but, restoration, of, coastal, ecosystems, has, received, insufficient, attention, since, coasts, are, constantly, changing, a, coastline, s, exact, perimeter, cannot, be, determined, this, measurement, challenge, is, called, the, coastline, paradox, the, term, coastal, zone, is, used, to, refer, to, a, region, where, interactions, of, sea, and, land, processes, occur, both, the, terms, coast, and, coastal, are, often, used, to, describe, a, geographic, location, or, region, located, on, a, coastline, e, g, new, zealand, s, west, coast, or, the, east, west, and, gulf, coast, of, the, united, states, coasts, with, a, narrow, continental, shelf, that, are, close, to, the, open, ocean, are, called, pelagic, coast, while, other, coasts, are, more, sheltered, coast, in, a, gulf, or, bay, a, shore, on, the, other, hand, may, refer, to, parts, of, land, adjoining, any, large, body, of, water, including, oceans, sea, shore, and, lakes, lake, shore, the, earth, has, approximately, 620, 000, kilometres, 390, 000, mi, of, coastline, coastal, habitats, which, extend, to, the, margins, of, the, continental, shelves, make, up, about, 7, percent, of, the, earth, s, oceans, but, at, least, 85, of, commercially, harvested, fish, depend, on, coastal, environments, during, at, least, part, of, their, life, cycle, as, of, october, 2010, about, 2, 86, of, exclusive, economic, zones, were, part, of, marine, protected, areas, the, definition, of, coasts, varies, marine, scientists, think, of, the, wet, aquatic, or, intertidal, vegetated, habitats, as, being, coastal, ecosystems, including, seagrass, salt, marsh, etc, whilst, some, terrestrial, scientists, might, only, think, of, coastal, ecosystems, as, purely, terrestrial, plants, that, live, close, to, the, seashore, see, also, estuaries, and, coastal, ecosystems, while, there, is, general, agreement, in, the, scientific, community, regarding, the, definition, of, coast, in, the, political, sphere, the, delineation, of, the, extents, of, a, coast, differ, according, to, jurisdiction, government, authorities, in, various, countries, may, define, coast, differently, for, economic, and, social, policy, reasons, the, coastline, paradox, is, the, counterintuitive, observation, that, the, coastline, of, a, landmass, does, not, have, a, well, defined, length, this, results, from, the, fractal, curve, like, properties, of, coastlines, i, e, the, fact, that, a, coastline, typically, has, a, fractal, dimension, although, the, paradox, of, length, was, previously, noted, by, hugo, steinhaus, the, first, systematic, study, of, this, phenomenon, was, by, lewis, fry, richardson, and, it, was, expanded, upon, by, benoit, mandelbrot, tides, often, determine, the, range, over, which, sediment, is, deposited, or, eroded, areas, with, high, tidal, ranges, allow, waves, to, reach, farther, up, the, shore, and, areas, with, lower, tidal, ranges, produce, deposition, at, a, smaller, elevation, interval, the, tidal, range, is, influenced, by, the, size, and, shape, of, the, coastline, tides, do, not, typically, cause, erosion, by, themselves, however, tidal, bores, can, erode, as, the, waves, surge, up, the, river, estuaries, from, the, ocean, 421, geologists, classify, coasts, on, the, basis, of, tidal, range, into, macrotidal, coasts, with, a, tidal, range, greater, than, 4, m, 13, ft, mesotidal, coasts, with, a, tidal, range, of, 2, to, 4, m, 6, 6, to, 13, ft, and, microtidal, coasts, with, a, tidal, range, of, less, than, 2, m, 7, ft, the, distinction, between, macrotidal, and, mesotidal, coasts, is, more, important, macrotidal, coasts, lack, barrier, islands, and, lagoons, and, are, characterized, by, funnel, shaped, estuaries, containing, sand, ridges, aligned, with, tidal, currents, wave, action, is, much, more, important, for, determining, bedforms, of, sediments, deposited, along, mesotidal, and, microtidal, coasts, than, in, macrotidal, coasts, waves, erode, coastline, as, they, break, on, shore, releasing, their, energy, the, larger, the, wave, the, more, energy, it, releases, and, the, more, sediment, it, moves, coastlines, with, longer, shores, have, more, room, for, the, waves, to, disperse, their, energy, while, coasts, with, cliffs, and, short, shore, faces, give, little, room, for, the, wave, energy, to, be, dispersed, in, these, areas, the, wave, energy, breaking, against, the, cliffs, is, higher, and, air, and, water, are, compressed, into, cracks, in, the, rock, forcing, the, rock, apart, breaking, it, down, sediment, deposited, by, waves, comes, from, eroded, cliff, faces, and, is, moved, along, the, coastline, by, the, waves, this, forms, an, abrasion, or, cliffed, coast, sediment, deposited, by, rivers, is, the, dominant, influence, on, the, amount, of, sediment, located, in, the, case, of, coastlines, that, have, estuaries, today, riverine, deposition, at, the, coast, is, often, blocked, by, dams, and, other, human, regulatory, devices, which, remove, the, sediment, from, the, stream, by, causing, it, to, be, deposited, inland, coral, reefs, are, a, provider, of, sediment, for, coastlines, of, tropical, islands, like, the, ocean, which, shapes, them, coasts, are, a, dynamic, environment, with, constant, change, the, earth, s, natural, processes, particularly, sea, level, rises, waves, and, various, weather, phenomena, have, resulted, in, the, erosion, accretion, and, reshaping, of, coasts, as, well, as, flooding, and, creation, of, continental, shelves, and, drowned, river, valleys, rias, more, and, more, of, the, world, s, people, live, in, coastal, regions, according, to, a, united, nations, atlas, 44, of, all, people, live, within, 150, km, 93, mi, of, the, sea, many, major, cities, are, on, or, near, good, harbors, and, have, port, facilities, some, landlocked, places, have, achieved, port, status, by, building, canals, nations, defend, their, coasts, against, military, invaders, smugglers, and, illegal, migrants, fixed, coastal, defenses, have, long, been, erected, in, many, nations, and, coastal, countries, typically, have, a, navy, and, some, form, of, coast, guard, coasts, especially, those, with, beaches, and, warm, water, attract, tourists, often, leading, to, the, development, of, seaside, resort, communities, in, many, island, nations, such, as, those, of, the, mediterranean, south, pacific, ocean, and, caribbean, tourism, is, central, to, the, economy, coasts, offer, recreational, activities, such, as, swimming, fishing, surfing, boating, and, sunbathing, growth, management, and, coastal, management, can, be, a, challenge, for, coastal, local, authorities, who, often, struggle, to, provide, the, infrastructure, required, by, new, residents, and, poor, management, practices, of, construction, often, leave, these, communities, and, infrastructure, vulnerable, to, processes, like, coastal, erosion, and, sea, level, rise, in, many, of, these, communities, management, practices, such, as, beach, nourishment, or, when, the, coastal, infrastructure, is, no, longer, financially, sustainable, managed, retreat, to, remove, communities, from, the, coast, estuarine, and, marine, coastal, ecosystems, are, both, marine, ecosystems, together, these, ecosystems, perform, the, four, categories, of, ecosystem, services, in, a, variety, of, ways, the, provisioning, services, include, forest, products, marine, products, fresh, water, raw, materials, biochemical, and, genetic, resources, regulating, services, include, carbon, sequestration, contributing, to, climate, change, mitigation, as, well, as, waste, treatment, and, disease, regulation, and, buffer, zones, supporting, services, of, coastal, ecosystems, include, nutrient, cycling, biologically, mediated, habitats, and, primary, production, cultural, services, of, coastal, ecosystems, include, inspirational, aspects, recreation, and, tourism, science, and, education, according, to, one, principle, of, classification, an, emergent, coastline, is, a, coastline, that, has, experienced, a, fall, in, sea, level, because, of, either, a, global, sea, level, change, or, local, uplift, emergent, coastlines, are, identifiable, by, the, coastal, landforms, which, are, above, the, high, tide, mark, such, as, raised, beaches, in, contrast, a, submergent, coastline, is, one, where, the, sea, level, has, risen, due, to, a, global, sea, level, change, local, subsidence, or, isostatic, rebound, submergent, coastlines, are, identifiable, by, their, submerged, or, drowned, landforms, such, as, rias, drowned, valleys, and, fjords, according, to, the, second, principle, of, classification, a, concordant, coastline, is, a, coastline, where, bands, of, different, rock, types, run, parallel, to, the, shore, these, rock, types, are, usually, of, varying, resistance, so, the, coastline, forms, distinctive, landforms, such, as, coves, discordant, coastlines, feature, distinctive, landforms, because, the, rocks, are, eroded, by, the, ocean, waves, the, less, resistant, rocks, erode, faster, creating, inlets, or, bay, the, more, resistant, rocks, erode, more, slowly, remaining, as, headlands, or, outcroppings, parts, of, a, coastline, can, be, categorised, as, high, energy, coast, or, low, energy, coast, the, distinguishing, characteristics, of, a, high, energy, coast, are, that, the, average, wave, energy, is, relatively, high, so, that, erosion, of, small, grained, material, tends, to, exceed, deposition, and, consequently, landforms, like, cliffs, headlands, and, wave, cut, terraces, develop, low, energy, coasts, are, generally, sheltered, from, waves, or, in, regions, where, the, average, wind, wave, and, swell, conditions, are, relatively, mild, low, energy, coasts, typically, change, slowly, and, tend, to, be, depositional, environments, high, energy, coasts, are, exposed, to, the, direct, impact, of, waves, and, storms, and, are, generally, erosional, environments, high, energy, storm, events, can, make, large, changes, to, a, coastline, and, can, move, significant, amounts, of, sediment, over, a, short, period, sometimes, changing, a, shoreline, configuration, swash, is, the, shoreward, flow, after, the, break, backwash, is, the, water, flow, back, down, the, beach, the, relative, strength, of, flow, in, the, swash, and, backwash, determines, what, size, grains, are, deposited, or, eroded, this, is, dependent, on, how, the, wave, breaks, and, the, slope, of, the, shore, depending, on, the, form, of, the, breaking, wave, its, energy, can, carry, granular, material, up, the, beach, and, deposit, it, or, erode, it, by, carrying, more, material, down, the, slope, than, up, it, steep, waves, that, are, close, together, and, break, with, the, surf, plunging, down, onto, the, shore, slope, expend, much, of, their, energy, lifting, the, sediment, the, weak, swash, does, not, carry, it, far, up, the, slope, and, the, strong, backwash, carries, it, further, down, the, slope, where, it, either, settles, in, deeper, water, or, is, carried, along, the, shore, by, a, longshore, current, induced, by, an, angled, approach, of, the, wave, front, to, the, shore, these, waves, which, erode, the, beach, are, called, destructive, waves, low, waves, that, are, further, apart, and, break, by, spilling, expend, more, of, their, energy, in, the, swash, which, carries, particles, up, the, beach, leaving, less, energy, for, the, backwash, to, transport, them, downslope, with, a, net, constrictive, influence, on, the, beach, riviera, is, an, italian, word, for, shoreline, ultimately, derived, from, latin, ripa, riverbank, it, came, to, be, applied, as, a, proper, name, to, the, coast, of, the, ligurian, sea, in, the, form, riviera, ligure, then, shortened, to, riviera, historically, the, ligurian, riviera, extended, from, capo, corvo, punta, bianca, south, of, genoa, north, and, west, into, what, is, now, french, territory, past, monaco, and, sometimes, as, far, as, marseilles, today, this, coast, is, divided, into, the, italian, riviera, and, the, french, riviera, although, the, french, use, the, term, riviera, to, refer, to, the, italian, riviera, and, call, the, french, portion, the, c, te, d, azur, as, a, result, of, the, fame, of, the, ligurian, rivieras, the, term, came, into, english, to, refer, to, any, shoreline, especially, one, that, is, sunny, topographically, diverse, and, popular, with, tourists, such, places, using, the, term, include, the, australian, riviera, in, queensland, and, the, turkish, riviera, along, the, aegean, sea, the, following, articles, describe, some, coastal, landforms, coastal, waters, or, coastal, seas, is, a, rather, general, term, used, differently, in, different, contexts, ranging, geographically, from, the, waters, within, a, few, kilometers, of, the, coast, through, to, the, entire, continental, shelf, which, may, stretch, for, more, than, a, hundred, kilometers, from, land, thus, the, term, coastal, waters, is, used, in, a, slightly, different, way, in, discussions, of, legal, and, economic, boundaries, see, territorial, waters, and, international, waters, or, when, considering, the, geography, of, coastal, landforms, or, the, ecological, systems, operating, through, the, continental, shelf, marine, coastal, ecosystems, the, research, on, coastal, waters, often, divides, into, these, separate, areas, too, the, dynamic, fluid, nature, of, the, ocean, means, that, all, components, of, the, whole, ocean, system, are, ultimately, connected, although, certain, regional, classifications, are, useful, and, relevant, the, waters, of, the, continental, shelves, represent, such, a, region, the, term, coastal, waters, has, been, used, in, a, wide, variety, of, different, ways, in, different, contexts, in, european, union, environmental, management, it, extends, from, the, coast, to, just, a, few, nautical, miles, while, in, the, united, states, the, us, epa, considers, this, region, to, extend, much, further, offshore, coastal, waters, has, specific, meanings, in, the, context, of, commercial, coastal, shipping, and, somewhat, different, meanings, in, the, context, of, naval, littoral, warfare, oceanographers, and, marine, biologists, have, yet, other, takes, coastal, waters, have, a, wide, range, of, marine, habitats, from, enclosed, estuaries, to, the, open, waters, of, the, continental, shelf, similarly, the, term, littoral, zone, has, no, single, definition, it, is, the, part, of, a, sea, lake, or, river, that, is, close, to, the, shore, in, coastal, environments, the, littoral, zone, extends, from, the, high, water, mark, which, is, rarely, inundated, to, shoreline, areas, that, are, permanently, submerged, coastal, waters, can, be, threatened, by, coastal, eutrophication, and, harmful, algal, blooms, the, identification, of, bodies, of, rock, formed, from, sediments, deposited, in, shoreline, and, nearshore, environments, shoreline, and, nearshore, facies, is, extremely, important, to, geologists, these, provide, vital, clues, for, reconstructing, the, geography, of, ancient, continents, paleogeography, the, locations, of, these, beds, show, the, extent, of, ancient, seas, at, particular, points, in, geological, time, and, provide, clues, to, the, magnitudes, of, tides, in, the, distant, past, sediments, deposited, in, the, shoreface, are, preserved, as, lenses, of, sandstone, in, which, the, upper, part, of, the, sandstone, is, coarser, than, the, lower, part, a, coarsening, upwards, sequence, geologists, refer, to, these, are, parasequences, each, records, an, episode, of, retreat, of, the, ocean, from, the, shoreline, over, a, period, of, 10, 000, to, 1, 000, 000, years, these, often, show, laminations, reflecting, various, kinds, of, tidal, cycles, some, of, the, best, studied, shoreline, deposits, in, the, world, are, found, along, the, former, western, shore, of, the, western, interior, seaway, a, shallow, sea, that, flooded, central, north, america, during, the, late, cretaceous, period, about, 100, to, 66, million, years, ago, these, are, beautifully, exposed, along, the, book, cliffs, of, utah, and, colorado, the, following, articles, describe, the, various, geologic, processes, that, affect, a, coastal, zone, larger, animals, that, live, in, coastal, areas, include, puffins, sea, turtles, and, rockhopper, penguins, among, many, others, sea, snails, and, various, kinds, of, barnacles, live, on, rocky, coasts, and, scavenge, on, food, deposited, by, the, sea, some, coastal, animals, are, used, to, humans, in, developed, areas, such, as, dolphins, and, seagulls, who, eat, food, thrown, for, them, by, tourists, since, the, coastal, areas, are, all, part, of, the, littoral, zone, there, is, a, profusion, of, marine, life, found, just, off, coast, including, sessile, animals, such, as, corals, sponges, starfish, mussels, seaweeds, fishes, and, sea, anemones, there, are, many, kinds, of, seabirds, on, various, coasts, these, include, pelicans, and, cormorants, who, join, up, with, terns, and, oystercatchers, to, forage, for, fish, and, shellfish, there, are, sea, lions, on, the, coast, of, wales, and, other, countries, coastal, fish, also, called, inshore, fish, or, neritic, fish, inhabit, the, sea, between, the, shoreline, and, the, edge, of, the, continental, shelf, since, the, continental, shelf, is, usually, less, than, 200, metres, 660, ft, deep, it, follows, that, pelagic, coastal, fish, are, generally, epipelagic, fish, inhabiting, the, sunlit, epipelagic, zone, coastal, fish, can, be, contrasted, with, oceanic, fish, or, offshore, fish, which, inhabit, the, deep, seas, beyond, the, continental, shelves, many, coastal, areas, are, famous, for, their, kelp, beds, kelp, is, a, fast, growing, seaweed, that, can, grow, up, to, half, a, meter, a, day, in, ideal, conditions, mangroves, seagrasses, macroalgal, beds, and, salt, marsh, are, important, coastal, vegetation, types, in, tropical, and, temperate, environments, respectively, restinga, is, another, type, of, coastal, vegetation, coasts, also, face, many, human, induced, environmental, impacts, and, coastal, development, hazards, the, most, important, ones, are, the, pollution, of, coastlines, is, connected, to, marine, pollution, which, can, occur, from, a, number, of, sources, marine, debris, garbage, and, industrial, debris, the, transportation, of, petroleum, in, tankers, increasing, the, probability, of, large, oil, spills, small, oil, spills, created, by, large, and, small, vessels, which, flush, bilge, water, into, the, ocean, marine, pollution, occurs, when, substances, used, or, spread, by, humans, such, as, industrial, agricultural, and, residential, waste, particles, noise, excess, carbon, dioxide, or, invasive, organisms, enter, the, ocean, and, cause, harmful, effects, there, the, majority, of, this, waste, 80, comes, from, land, based, activity, although, marine, transportation, significantly, contributes, as, well, it, is, a, combination, of, chemicals, and, trash, most, of, which, comes, from, land, sources, and, is, washed, or, blown, into, the, ocean, this, pollution, results, in, damage, to, the, environment, to, the, health, of, all, organisms, and, to, economic, structures, worldwide, since, most, inputs, come, from, land, either, via, the, rivers, sewage, or, the, atmosphere, it, means, that, continental, shelves, are, more, vulnerable, to, pollution, air, pollution, is, also, a, contributing, factor, by, carrying, off, iron, carbonic, acid, nitrogen, silicon, sulfur, pesticides, or, dust, particles, into, the, ocean, the, pollution, often, comes, from, nonpoint, sources, such, as, agricultural, runoff, wind, blown, debris, and, dust, these, nonpoint, sources, are, largely, due, to, runoff, that, enters, the, ocean, through, rivers, but, wind, blown, debris, and, dust, can, also, play, a, role, as, these, pollutants, can, settle, into, waterways, and, oceans, pathways, of, pollution, include, direct, discharge, land, runoff, ship, pollution, bilge, pollution, atmospheric, pollution, and, potentially, deep, sea, mining, marine, debris, also, known, as, marine, litter, is, human, created, solid, material, that, has, deliberately, or, accidentally, been, released, in, seas, or, the, ocean, floating, oceanic, debris, tends, to, accumulate, at, the, center, of, gyres, and, on, coastlines, frequently, washing, aground, when, it, is, known, as, beach, litter, or, tidewrack, deliberate, disposal, of, wastes, at, sea, is, called, ocean, dumping, naturally, occurring, debris, such, as, driftwood, and, drift, seeds, are, also, present, with, the, increasing, use, of, plastic, human, influence, has, become, an, issue, as, many, types, of, petrochemical, plastics, do, not, biodegrade, quickly, as, would, natural, or, organic, materials, the, largest, single, type, of, plastic, pollution, 10, and, majority, of, large, plastic, in, the, oceans, is, discarded, and, lost, nets, from, the, fishing, industry, waterborne, plastic, poses, a, serious, threat, to, fish, seabirds, marine, reptiles, and, marine, mammals, as, well, as, to, boats, and, coasts, a, growing, concern, regarding, plastic, pollution, in, the, marine, ecosystem, is, the, use, of, microplastics, microplastics, are, beads, of, plastic, less, than, 5, millimeters, wide, and, they, are, commonly, found, in, hand, soaps, face, cleansers, and, other, exfoliators, when, these, products, are, used, the, microplastics, go, through, the, water, filtration, system, and, into, the, ocean, but, because, of, their, small, size, they, are, likely, to, escape, capture, by, the, preliminary, treatment, screens, on, wastewater, plants, these, beads, are, harmful, to, the, organisms, in, the, ocean, especially, filter, feeders, because, they, can, easily, ingest, the, plastic, and, become, sick, the, microplastics, are, such, a, concern, because, it, is, difficult, to, clean, them, up, due, to, their, size, so, humans, can, try, to, avoid, using, these, harmful, plastics, by, purchasing, products, that, use, environmentally, safe, exfoliates, between, 1901, and, 2018, the, average, sea, level, rose, by, 15, 25, cm, 6, 10, in, with, an, increase, of, 2, 3, mm, 0, 091, in, per, year, since, the, 1970s,
