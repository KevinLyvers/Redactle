polyethylene, or, polythene, abbreviated, pe, iupac, name, polyethene, or, poly, methylene, is, the, most, commonly, produced, plastic, it, is, a, polymer, primarily, used, for, packaging, plastic, bags, plastic, films, geomembranes, and, containers, including, bottles, etc, as, of, 2017, over, 100, million, tonnes, of, polyethylene, resins, are, being, produced, annually, accounting, for, 34, of, the, total, plastics, market, many, kinds, of, polyethylene, are, known, with, most, having, the, chemical, formula, c, 2, h, 4, n, pe, is, usually, a, mixture, of, similar, polymers, of, ethylene, with, various, values, of, n, it, can, be, low, density, or, high, density, and, many, variations, thereof, its, properties, can, be, modified, further, by, crosslinking, or, copolymerization, all, forms, are, nontoxic, as, well, as, chemically, resilient, contributing, to, polyethylene, s, popularity, as, a, multi, use, plastic, however, polyethylene, s, chemical, resilience, also, makes, it, a, long, lived, and, decomposition, resistant, pollutant, when, disposed, of, improperly, being, a, hydrocarbon, polyethylene, is, colorless, to, opaque, without, impurities, or, colorants, and, combustible, polyethylene, was, first, synthesized, by, the, german, chemist, hans, von, pechmann, who, prepared, it, by, accident, in, 1898, while, investigating, diazomethane, when, his, colleagues, eugen, bamberger, and, friedrich, tschirner, characterized, the, white, waxy, substance, that, he, had, created, they, recognized, that, it, contained, long, ch, 2, chains, and, termed, it, polymethylene, the, first, industrially, practical, polyethylene, synthesis, diazomethane, is, a, notoriously, unstable, substance, that, is, generally, avoided, in, industrial, syntheses, was, again, accidentally, discovered, in, 1933, by, eric, fawcett, and, reginald, gibson, at, the, imperial, chemical, industries, ici, works, in, northwich, england, upon, applying, extremely, high, pressure, several, hundred, atmospheres, to, a, mixture, of, ethylene, and, benzaldehyde, they, again, produced, a, white, waxy, material, because, the, reaction, had, been, initiated, by, trace, oxygen, contamination, in, their, apparatus, the, experiment, was, difficult, to, reproduce, at, first, it, was, not, until, 1935, that, another, ici, chemist, michael, perrin, developed, this, accident, into, a, reproducible, high, pressure, synthesis, for, polyethylene, that, became, the, basis, for, industrial, low, density, polyethylene, ldpe, production, beginning, in, 1939, because, polyethylene, was, found, to, have, very, low, loss, properties, at, very, high, frequency, radio, waves, commercial, distribution, in, britain, was, suspended, on, the, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, secrecy, imposed, and, the, new, process, was, used, to, produce, insulation, for, uhf, and, shf, coaxial, cables, of, radar, sets, during, world, war, ii, further, research, was, done, on, the, ici, process, and, in, 1944, dupont, at, sabine, river, texas, and, union, carbide, corporation, at, south, charleston, west, virginia, began, large, scale, commercial, production, under, license, from, ici, the, landmark, breakthrough, in, the, commercial, production, of, polyethylene, began, with, the, development, of, catalysts, that, promoted, the, polymerization, at, mild, temperatures, and, pressures, the, first, of, these, was, a, catalyst, based, on, chromium, trioxide, discovered, in, 1951, by, robert, banks, and, j, paul, hogan, at, phillips, petroleum, in, 1953, the, german, chemist, karl, ziegler, developed, a, catalytic, system, based, on, titanium, halides, and, organoaluminium, compounds, that, worked, at, even, milder, conditions, than, the, phillips, catalyst, the, phillips, catalyst, is, less, expensive, and, easier, to, work, with, however, and, both, methods, are, heavily, used, industrially, by, the, end, of, the, 1950s, both, the, phillips, and, ziegler, type, catalysts, were, being, used, for, high, density, polyethylene, hdpe, production, in, the, 1970s, the, ziegler, system, was, improved, by, the, incorporation, of, magnesium, chloride, catalytic, systems, based, on, soluble, catalysts, the, metallocenes, were, reported, in, 1976, by, walter, kaminsky, and, hansj, rg, sinn, the, ziegler, and, metallocene, based, catalysts, families, have, proven, to, be, very, flexible, at, copolymerizing, ethylene, with, other, olefins, and, have, become, the, basis, for, the, wide, range, of, polyethylene, resins, available, today, including, very, low, density, polyethylene, and, linear, low, density, polyethylene, such, resins, in, the, form, of, uhmwpe, fibers, have, as, of, 2005, begun, to, replace, aramids, in, many, high, strength, applications, the, properties, of, polyethylene, depends, strongly, on, type, the, molecular, weight, crosslinking, and, presence, of, comonomers, all, strongly, affect, its, properties, it, is, for, this, structure, property, relation, that, intense, effort, has, been, invested, into, diverse, kinds, of, pe, ldpe, is, softer, and, more, transparent, than, hdpe, for, medium, and, high, density, polyethylene, the, melting, point, is, typically, in, the, range, 120, to, 130, c, 248, to, 266, f, the, melting, point, for, average, commercial, low, density, polyethylene, is, typically, 105, to, 115, c, 221, to, 239, f, these, temperatures, vary, strongly, with, the, type, of, polyethylene, but, the, theoretical, upper, limit, of, melting, of, polyethylene, is, reported, to, be, 144, to, 146, c, 291, to, 295, f, combustion, typically, occurs, above, 349, c, 660, f, most, ldpe, mdpe, and, hdpe, grades, have, excellent, chemical, resistance, meaning, that, they, are, not, attacked, by, strong, acids, or, strong, bases, and, are, resistant, to, gentle, oxidants, and, reducing, agents, crystalline, samples, do, not, dissolve, at, room, temperature, polyethylene, other, than, cross, linked, polyethylene, usually, can, be, dissolved, at, elevated, temperatures, in, aromatic, hydrocarbons, such, as, toluene, or, xylene, or, in, chlorinated, solvents, such, as, trichloroethane, or, trichlorobenzene, polyethylene, absorbs, almost, no, water, the, gas, and, water, vapour, permeability, only, polar, gases, is, lower, than, for, most, plastics, oxygen, carbon, dioxide, and, flavorings, on, the, other, hand, can, pass, it, easily, polyethylene, burns, slowly, with, a, blue, flame, having, a, yellow, tip, and, gives, off, an, odour, of, paraffin, similar, to, candle, flame, the, material, continues, burning, on, removal, of, the, flame, source, and, produces, a, drip, polyethylene, cannot, be, imprinted, or, bonded, with, adhesives, without, pretreatment, high, strength, joints, are, readily, achieved, with, plastic, welding, polyethylene, is, a, good, electrical, insulator, it, offers, good, electrical, treeing, resistance, however, it, becomes, easily, electrostatically, charged, which, can, be, reduced, by, additions, of, graphite, carbon, black, or, antistatic, agents, when, pure, the, dielectric, constant, is, in, the, range, 2, 2, to, 2, 4, depending, on, the, density, and, the, loss, tangent, is, very, low, making, it, a, good, dielectric, for, building, capacitors, for, the, same, reason, it, is, commonly, used, as, the, insulation, material, for, high, frequency, coaxial, and, twisted, pair, cables, depending, on, thermal, history, and, film, thickness, pe, can, vary, between, almost, clear, transparent, milky, opaque, translucent, and, opaque, ldpe, has, the, greatest, lldpe, slightly, less, and, hdpe, the, least, transparency, transparency, is, reduced, by, crystallites, if, they, are, larger, than, the, wavelength, of, visible, light, the, ingredient, or, monomer, is, ethylene, iupac, name, ethene, a, gaseous, hydrocarbon, with, the, formula, c, 2, h, 4, which, can, be, viewed, as, a, pair, of, methylene, groups, ch, 2, connected, to, each, other, typical, specifications, for, pe, purity, are, 5, ppm, for, water, oxygen, and, other, alkenes, contents, acceptable, contaminants, include, n, 2, ethane, common, precursor, to, ethylene, and, methane, ethylene, is, usually, produced, from, petrochemical, sources, but, also, is, generated, by, dehydration, of, ethanol, polymerization, of, ethylene, to, polyethylene, is, described, by, the, following, chemical, equation, ethylene, is, a, stable, molecule, that, polymerizes, only, upon, contact, with, catalysts, the, conversion, is, highly, exothermic, coordination, polymerization, is, the, most, pervasive, technology, which, means, that, metal, chlorides, or, metal, oxides, are, used, the, most, common, catalysts, consist, of, titanium, iii, chloride, the, so, called, ziegler, natta, catalysts, another, common, catalyst, is, the, phillips, catalyst, prepared, by, depositing, chromium, vi, oxide, on, silica, polyethylene, can, be, produced, through, radical, polymerization, but, this, route, has, only, limited, utility, and, typically, requires, high, pressure, apparatus, commonly, used, methods, for, joining, polyethylene, parts, together, include, pressure, sensitive, adhesives, psa, are, feasible, if, the, surface, chemistry, or, charge, is, modified, with, plasma, activation, flame, treatment, or, corona, treatment, polyethylene, is, classified, by, its, density, and, branching, its, mechanical, properties, depend, significantly, on, variables, such, as, the, extent, and, type, of, branching, the, crystal, structure, and, the, molecular, weight, there, are, several, types, of, polyethylene, with, regard, to, sold, volumes, the, most, important, polyethylene, grades, are, hdpe, lldpe, and, ldpe, uhmwpe, is, polyethylene, with, a, molecular, weight, numbering, in, the, millions, usually, between, 3, 5, and, 7, 5, million, amu, the, high, molecular, weight, makes, it, a, very, tough, material, but, results, in, less, efficient, packing, of, the, chains, into, the, crystal, structure, as, evidenced, by, densities, of, less, than, high, density, polyethylene, for, example, 0, 930, 0, 935, g, cm, 3, uhmwpe, can, be, made, through, any, catalyst, technology, although, ziegler, catalysts, are, most, common, because, of, its, outstanding, toughness, and, its, cut, wear, and, excellent, chemical, resistance, uhmwpe, is, used, in, a, diverse, range, of, applications, these, include, can, and, bottle, handling, machine, parts, moving, parts, on, weaving, machines, bearings, gears, artificial, joints, edge, protection, on, ice, rinks, steel, cable, replacements, on, ships, and, butchers, chopping, boards, it, is, commonly, used, for, the, construction, of, articular, portions, of, implants, used, for, hip, and, knee, replacements, as, fiber, it, competes, with, aramid, in, bulletproof, vests, hdpe, is, defined, by, a, density, of, greater, or, equal, to, 0, 941, g, cm, 3, hdpe, has, a, low, degree, of, branching, the, mostly, linear, molecules, pack, together, well, so, intermolecular, forces, are, stronger, than, in, highly, branched, polymers, hdpe, can, be, produced, by, chromium, silica, catalysts, ziegler, natta, catalysts, or, metallocene, catalysts, by, choosing, catalysts, and, reaction, conditions, the, small, amount, of, branching, that, does, occur, can, be, controlled, these, catalysts, prefer, the, formation, of, free, radicals, at, the, ends, of, the, growing, polyethylene, molecules, they, cause, new, ethylene, monomers, to, add, to, the, ends, of, the, molecules, rather, than, along, the, middle, causing, the, growth, of, a, linear, chain, hdpe, has, high, tensile, strength, it, is, used, in, products, and, packaging, such, as, milk, jugs, detergent, bottles, butter, tubs, garbage, containers, and, water, pipes, pex, is, a, medium, to, high, density, polyethylene, containing, cross, link, bonds, introduced, into, the, polymer, structure, changing, the, thermoplastic, into, a, thermoset, the, high, temperature, properties, of, the, polymer, are, improved, its, flow, is, reduced, and, its, chemical, resistance, is, enhanced, pex, is, used, in, some, potable, water, plumbing, systems, because, tubes, made, of, the, material, can, be, expanded, to, fit, over, a, metal, nipple, and, it, will, slowly, return, to, its, original, shape, forming, a, permanent, water, tight, connection, mdpe, is, defined, by, a, density, range, of, 0, 926, 0, 940, g, cm, 3, mdpe, can, be, produced, by, chromium, silica, catalysts, ziegler, natta, catalysts, or, metallocene, catalysts, mdpe, has, good, shock, and, drop, resistance, properties, it, also, is, less, notch, sensitive, than, hdpe, stress, cracking, resistance, is, better, than, hdpe, mdpe, is, typically, used, in, gas, pipes, and, fittings, sacks, shrink, film, packaging, film, carrier, bags, and, screw, closures, lldpe, is, defined, by, a, density, range, of, 0, 915, 0, 925, g, cm, 3, lldpe, is, a, substantially, linear, polymer, with, significant, numbers, of, short, branches, commonly, made, by, copolymerization, of, ethylene, with, short, chain, alpha, olefins, for, example, 1, butene, 1, hexene, and, 1, octene, lldpe, has, higher, tensile, strength, than, ldpe, and, it, exhibits, higher, impact, and, puncture, resistance, than, ldpe, lower, thickness, gauge, films, can, be, blown, compared, with, ldpe, with, better, environmental, stress, cracking, resistance, but, they, are, not, as, easy, to, process, lldpe, is, used, in, packaging, particularly, film, for, bags, and, sheets, lower, thickness, may, be, used, compared, to, ldpe, it, is, used, for, cable, coverings, toys, lids, buckets, containers, and, pipe, while, other, applications, are, available, lldpe, is, used, predominantly, in, film, applications, due, to, its, toughness, flexibility, and, relative, transparency, product, examples, range, from, agricultural, films, saran, wrap, and, bubble, wrap, to, multilayer, and, composite, films, ldpe, is, defined, by, a, density, range, of, 0, 910, 0, 940, g, cm, 3, ldpe, has, a, high, degree, of, short, and, long, chain, branching, which, means, that, the, chains, do, not, pack, into, the, crystal, structure, as, well, it, has, therefore, less, strong, intermolecular, forces, as, the, instantaneous, dipole, induced, dipole, attraction, is, less, this, results, in, a, lower, tensile, strength, and, increased, ductility, ldpe, is, created, by, free, radical, polymerization, the, high, degree, of, branching, with, long, chains, gives, molten, ldpe, unique, and, desirable, flow, properties, ldpe, is, used, for, both, rigid, containers, and, plastic, film, applications, such, as, plastic, bags, and, film, wrap, the, radical, polymerization, process, used, to, make, ldpe, does, not, include, a, catalyst, that, supervises, the, radical, sites, on, the, growing, pe, chains, in, hdpe, synthesis, the, radical, sites, are, at, the, ends, of, the, pe, chains, because, the, catalyst, stabilizes, their, formation, at, the, ends, secondary, radicals, in, the, middle, of, a, chain, are, more, stable, than, primary, radicals, at, the, end, of, the, chain, and, tertiary, radicals, at, a, branch, point, are, more, stable, yet, each, time, an, ethylene, monomer, is, added, it, creates, a, primary, radical, but, often, these, will, rearrange, to, form, more, stable, secondary, or, tertiary, radicals, addition, of, ethylene, monomers, to, the, secondary, or, tertiary, sites, creates, branching, vldpe, is, defined, by, a, density, range, of, 0, 880, 0, 915, g, cm, 3, vldpe, is, a, substantially, linear, polymer, with, high, levels, of, short, chain, branches, commonly, made, by, copolymerization, of, ethylene, with, short, chain, alpha, olefins, for, example, 1, butene, 1, hexene, and, 1, octene, vldpe, is, most, commonly, produced, using, metallocene, catalysts, due, to, the, greater, co, monomer, incorporation, exhibited, by, these, catalysts, vldpes, are, used, for, hose, and, tubing, ice, and, frozen, food, bags, food, packaging, and, stretch, wrap, as, well, as, impact, modifiers, when, blended, with, other, polymers, much, research, activity, has, focused, on, the, nature, and, distribution, of, long, chain, branches, in, polyethylene, in, hdpe, a, relatively, small, number, of, these, branches, perhaps, one, in, 100, or, 1, 000, branches, per, backbone, carbon, can, significantly, affect, the, rheological, properties, of, the, polymer, in, addition, to, copolymerization, with, alpha, olefins, ethylene, can, be, copolymerized, with, a, wide, range, of, other, monomers, and, ionic, composition, that, creates, ionized, free, radicals, common, examples, include, vinyl, acetate, the, resulting, product, is, ethylene, vinyl, acetate, copolymer, or, eva, widely, used, in, athletic, shoe, sole, foams, and, a, variety, of, acrylates, applications, of, acrylic, copolymer, include, packaging, and, sporting, goods, and, superplasticizer, used, in, cement, production, the, particular, material, properties, of, polyethylene, depend, on, its, molecular, structure, molecular, weight, and, crystallinity, are, the, most, significant, factors, crystallinity, in, turn, depends, on, molecular, weight, and, degree, of, branching, the, less, the, polymer, chains, are, branched, and, the, lower, the, molecular, weight, the, higher, the, crystallinity, of, polyethylene, crystallinity, ranges, from, 35, pe, ld, pe, lld, to, 80, pe, hd, polyethylene, has, a, density, of, 1, 0, g, cm, 3, in, crystalline, regions, and, 0, 86, g, cm, 3, in, amorphous, regions, an, almost, linear, relationship, exists, between, density, and, crystallinity, the, degree, of, branching, of, the, different, types, of, polyethylene, can, be, schematically, represented, as, follows, the, figure, shows, polyethylene, backbones, short, chain, branches, and, side, chain, branches, the, polymer, chains, are, represented, linearly, the, properties, of, polyethylene, are, highly, dependent, on, type, and, number, of, chain, branches, the, chain, branches, in, turn, depend, on, the, process, used, either, the, high, pressure, process, only, pe, ld, or, the, low, pressure, process, all, other, pe, grades, low, density, polyethylene, is, produced, by, the, high, pressure, process, by, radical, polymerization, thereby, numerous, short, chain, branches, as, well, as, long, chain, branches, are, formed, short, chain, branches, are, formed, by, intramolecular, chain, transfer, reactions, they, are, always, butyl, or, ethyl, chain, branches, because, the, reaction, proceeds, after, the, following, mechanism, the, widespread, usage, of, polyethylene, poses, potential, difficulties, for, waste, management, because, it, is, not, readily, biodegradable, in, japan, getting, rid, of, plastics, in, an, environmentally, friendly, way, was, the, major, problem, discussed, until, the, fukushima, nuclear, disaster, in, 2011, became, a, larger, issue, it, was, listed, as, a, us, 90, billion, market, for, solutions, since, 2008, japan, has, rapidly, increased, the, recycling, of, plastics, but, still, has, a, large, amount, of, plastic, wrapping, which, goes, to, waste, in, 2010, a, japanese, researcher, akinori, ito, released, the, prototype, of, a, machine, which, creates, oil, from, polyethylene, using, a, small, self, contained, vapor, distillation, process, several, experiments, have, been, conducted, aimed, at, discovering, enzyme, or, organisms, that, will, degrade, polyethylene, the, results, are, mixed, it, is, clear, that, several, plastics, polyesters, polycarbonates, polyamides, biodegrade, either, by, hydrolysis, or, air, oxidation, in, some, cases, the, degradation, is, affected, by, bacteria, or, various, enzyme, cocktails, the, situation, is, very, different, polymers, where, the, backbone, consists, solely, of, c, c, bonds, these, polymers, include, polyethylene, but, also, polypropylene, polystyrene, and, acrylates, at, best, these, polymers, degrade, very, slowly, but, these, experiments, are, difficult, because, yields, and, rates, are, very, slow, further, confusing, the, situation, even, preliminary, successes, are, greeted, with, enthusiasm, by, the, popular, press, some, technical, challenges, in, this, area, include, the, failure, to, identify, enzymes, responsible, for, the, proposed, degradation, another, issue, is, that, organisms, are, incapable, of, importing, hydrocarbons, of, molecular, weight, greater, than, 500, the, bacterium, pseudomonas, fluorescens, with, the, help, of, sphingomonas, has, been, claimed, to, degrade, over, 40, of, the, weight, of, plastic, bags, within, six, weeks, the, thermophilic, bacterium, brevibacillus, borstelensis, strain, 707, was, claimed, to, use, low, density, polyethylene, as, a, sole, carbon, source, when, incubated, together, at, 50, c, biodegradation, increased, with, time, exposed, to, ultraviolet, radiation, acinetobacter, sp, 351, is, claimed, to, degrade, lower, molecular, weight, pe, oligomers, when, pe, is, subjected, to, thermo, and, photo, oxidization, products, including, alkanes, alkenes, ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, carboxylic, acid, keto, acids, dicarboxylic, acids, lactones, and, esters, are, released, the, indian, mealmoth, larvae, are, claimed, to, metabolize, polyethylene, based, on, observing, that, plastic, bags, at, his, home, had, small, holes, in, them, deducing, that, the, hungry, larvae, must, have, digested, the, plastic, somehow, he, and, his, team, analyzed, their, gut, bacteria, and, found, a, few, that, could, use, plastic, as, their, only, carbon, source, not, only, could, the, bacteria, from, the, guts, of, the, plodia, interpunctella, moth, larvae, metabolize, polyethylene, they, degraded, it, significantly, dropping, its, tensile, strength, by, 50, its, mass, by, 10, and, the, molecular, weights, of, its, polymeric, chains, by, 13, the, caterpillar, of, galleria, mellonella, is, claimed, to, consume, polyethylene, the, caterpillar, is, able, to, digest, polyethylene, due, to, a, combination, of, its, gut, microbiota, and, its, saliva, containing, enzymes, that, oxidise, and, depolymerise, the, plastic, when, exposed, to, ambient, solar, radiation, the, plastic, produces, two, greenhouse, gases, methane, and, ethylene, the, plastic, type, which, releases, gases, at, the, highest, rate, is, low, density, polyethylene, ldpe, due, to, its, low, density, it, breaks, down, more, easily, over, time, leading, to, higher, surface, areas, the, production, of, these, trace, gases, from, virgin, ldpe, increase, over, time, when, incubated, in, air, ldpe, emits, gases, at, rates, 2, times, and, 76, times, higher, in, comparison, to, incubation, in, water, for, methane, and, ethylene, respectively, however, based, on, the, rates, measured, in, the, study, methane, production, by, plastics, is, presently, an, insignificant, component, of, the, global, methane, budget, polyethylene, may, either, be, modified, in, the, polymerization, by, polar, or, non, polar, comonomers, or, after, polymerization, through, polymer, analogous, reactions, common, polymer, analogous, reactions, are, in, case, of, polyethylene, crosslinking, chlorination, and, sulfochlorination, in, the, low, pressure, process, olefins, e, g, 1, butene, or, 1, hexene, may, be, added, which, are, incorporated, in, the, polymer, chain, during, polymerization, these, copolymers, introduce, short, side, chains, thus, crystallinity, and, density, are, reduced, as, explained, above, mechanical, and, thermal, properties, are, changed, thereby, in, particular, pe, lld, is, produced, this, way, metallocene, polyethylene, pe, m, is, prepared, by, means, of, metallocene, catalysts, usually, including, copolymers, z, b, ethene, hexene, metallocene, polyethylene, has, a, relatively, narrow, molecular, weight, distribution, exceptionally, high, toughness, excellent, optical, properties, and, a, uniform, comonomer, content, because, of, the, narrow, molecular, weight, distribution, it, behaves, less, pseudoplastic, especially, under, larger, shear, rates, metallocene, polyethylene, has, a, low, proportion, of, low, molecular, weight, extractable, components, and, a, low, welding, and, sealing, temperature, thus, it, is, particularly, suitable, for, the, food, industry, 238, 19, polyethylene, with, multimodal, molecular, weight, distribution, consists, of, several, polymer, fractions, which, are, homogeneously, mixed, such, polyethylene, types, offer, extremely, high, stiffness, toughness, strength, stress, crack, resistance, and, an, increased, crack, propagation, resistance, they, consist, of, equal, proportions, higher, and, lower, molecular, polymer, fractions, the, lower, molecular, weight, units, crystallize, easier, and, relax, faster, the, higher, molecular, weight, fractions, form, linking, molecules, between, crystallites, thereby, increasing, toughness, and, stress, crack, resistance, polyethylene, with, multimodal, molecular, weight, distribution, can, be, prepared, either, in, two, stage, reactors, by, catalysts, with, two, active, centers, on, a, carrier, or, by, blending, in, extruders, 238, cyclic, olefin, copolymers, are, prepared, by, copolymerization, of, ethene, and, cycloolefins, usually, norbornene, produced, by, using, metallocene, catalysts, the, resulting, polymers, are, amorphous, polymers, and, particularly, transparent, and, heat, resistant, 239, 27, the, basic, compounds, used, as, polar, comonomers, are, vinyl, alcohol, ethenol, an, unsaturated, alcohol, acrylic, acid, propenoic, acid, an, unsaturated, acid, and, esters, containing, one, of, the, two, compounds, ethylene, vinyl, alcohol, copolymer, evoh, is, formally, a, copolymer, of, pe, and, vinyl, alcohol, ethenol, which, is, prepared, by, partial, hydrolysis, of, ethylene, vinyl, acetate, copolymer, as, vinyl, alcohol, itself, is, not, stable, however, typically, evoh, has, a, higher, comonomer, content, than, the, vac, commonly, used, 239, evoh, is, used, in, multilayer, films, for, packaging, as, a, barrier, layer, barrier, plastic, as, evoh, is, hygroscopic, water, attracting, it, absorbs, water, from, the, environment, whereby, it, loses, its, barrier, effect, therefore, it, must, be, used, as, a, core, layer, surrounded, by, other, plastics, like, ldpe, pp, pa, or, pet, evoh, is, also, used, as, a, coating, agent, against, corrosion, at, street, lights, traffic, light, poles, and, noise, protection, walls, 239, copolymer, of, ethylene, and, unsaturated, carboxylic, acids, such, as, acrylic, acid, are, characterized, by, good, adhesion, to, diverse, materials, by, resistance, to, stress, cracking, and, high, flexibility, however, they, are, more, sensitive, to, heat, and, oxidation, than, ethylene, homopolymers, ethylene, acrylic, acid, copolymers, are, used, as, adhesion, promoters, if, salts, of, an, unsaturated, carboxylic, acid, are, present, in, the, polymer, thermo, reversible, ion, networks, are, formed, they, are, called, ionomers, ionomers, are, highly, transparent, thermoplastics, which, are, characterized, by, high, adhesion, to, metals, high, abrasion, resistance, and, high, water, absorption, if, unsaturated, esters, are, copolymerized, with, ethylene, either, the, alcohol, moiety, may, be, in, the, polymer, backbone, as, it, is, the, case, in, ethylene, vinyl, acetate, copolymer, or, of, the, acid, moiety, e, g, in, ethylene, ethyl, acrylate, copolymer, ethylene, vinyl, acetate, copolymers, are, prepared, similarly, to, ld, pe, by, high, pressure, polymerization, the, proportion, of, comonomer, has, a, decisive, influence, on, the, behaviour, of, the, polymer, the, density, decreases, up, to, a, comonomer, share, of, 10, because, of, the, disturbed, crystal, formation, with, higher, proportions, it, approaches, to, the, one, of, polyvinyl, acetate, 1, 17, g, cm, 3, 235, due, to, decreasing, crystallinity, ethylene, vinyl, acetate, copolymers, are, getting, softer, with, increasing, comonomer, content, the, polar, side, groups, change, the, chemical, properties, significantly, compared, to, polyethylene, 224, weather, resistance, adhesiveness, and, weldability, rise, with, comonomer, content, while, the, chemical, resistance, decreases, also, mechanical, properties, are, changed, stress, cracking, resistance, and, toughness, in, the, cold, rise, whereas, yield, stress, and, heat, resistance, decrease, with, a, very, high, proportion, of, comonomers, about, 50, rubbery, thermoplastics, are, produced, thermoplastic, elastomers, 235, ethylene, ethyl, acrylate, copolymers, behave, similarly, to, ethylene, vinyl, acetate, copolymers, 240, a, basic, distinction, is, made, between, peroxide, crosslinking, pe, xa, silane, crosslinking, pe, xb, electron, beam, crosslinking, pe, xc, and, azo, crosslinking, pe, xd, shown, are, the, peroxide, the, silane, and, irradiation, crosslinking, in, each, method, a, radical, is, generated, in, the, polyethylene, chain, top, center, either, by, radiation, h, or, by, peroxides, r, o, o, r, then, two, radical, chains, can, either, directly, crosslink, bottom, left, or, indirectly, by, silane, compounds, bottom, right, chlorinated, polyethylene, pe, c, is, an, inexpensive, material, having, a, chlorine, content, from, 34, to, 44, it, is, used, in, blends, with, pvc, because, the, soft, rubbery, chloropolyethylene, is, embedded, in, the, pvc, matrix, thereby, increasing, the, impact, resistance, it, also, increases, the, weather, resistance, furthermore, it, is, used, for, softening, pvc, foils, without, risking, the, migrate, of, plasticizers, chlorinated, polyethylene, can, be, crosslinked, peroxidically, to, form, an, elastomer, which, is, used, in, cable, and, rubber, industry, when, chlorinated, polyethylene, is, added, to, other, polyolefins, it, reduces, the, flammability, 245, chlorosulfonated, pe, csm, is, used, as, starting, material, for, ozone, resistant, synthetic, rubber, braskem, and, toyota, tsusho, corporation, started, joint, marketing, activities, to, produce, polyethylene, from, sugarcane, braskem, will, build, a, new, facility, at, their, existing, industrial, unit, in, triunfo, rio, grande, do, sul, brazil, with, an, annual, production, capacity, of, 200, 000, short, tons, 180, 000, 000, kg, and, will, produce, high, density, and, low, density, polyethylene, from, bioethanol, derived, from, sugarcane, polyethylene, can, also, be, made, from, other, feedstocks, including, wheat, grain, and, sugar, beet, these, developments, are, using, renewable, resources, rather, than, fossil, fuel, although, the, issue, of, plastic, source, is, currently, negligible, in, the, wake, of, plastic, waste, and, in, particular, polyethylene, waste, as, shown, above, the, name, polyethylene, comes, from, the, ingredient, and, not, the, resulting, chemical, compound, which, contains, no, double, bonds, the, scientific, name, polyethene, is, systematically, derived, from, the, scientific, name, of, the, monomer, the, alkene, monomer, converts, to, a, long, sometimes, very, long, alkane, in, the, polymerization, process, in, certain, circumstances, it, is, useful, to, use, a, structure, based, nomenclature, in, such, cases, iupac, recommends, poly, methylene, poly, methanediyl, is, a, non, preferred, alternative, the, difference, in, names, between, the, two, systems, is, due, to, the, opening, up, of, the, monomer, s, double, bond, upon, polymerization, the, name, is, abbreviated, to, pe, in, a, similar, manner, polypropylene, and, polystyrene, are, shortened, to, pp, and, ps, respectively, in, the, united, kingdom, and, india, the, polymer, is, commonly, called, polythene, from, the, ici, trade, name, although, this, is, not, recognized, scientifically
