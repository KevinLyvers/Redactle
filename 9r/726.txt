an, aurora, pl, aurorae, or, auroras, also, commonly, known, as, the, northern, lights, aurora, borealis, or, southern, lights, aurora, australis, is, a, natural, light, display, in, earth, s, sky, predominantly, seen, in, high, latitude, regions, around, the, arctic, and, antarctic, auroras, display, dynamic, patterns, of, brilliant, lights, that, appear, as, curtains, rays, spirals, or, dynamic, flickers, covering, the, entire, sky, auroras, are, the, result, of, disturbances, in, the, earth, s, magnetosphere, caused, by, the, solar, wind, major, disturbances, result, from, enhancements, in, the, speed, of, the, solar, wind, from, coronal, holes, and, coronal, mass, ejections, these, disturbances, alter, the, trajectories, of, charged, particles, in, the, magnetospheric, plasma, these, particles, mainly, electrons, and, protons, precipitate, into, the, upper, atmosphere, thermosphere, exosphere, the, resulting, ionization, and, excitation, of, atmospheric, constituents, emit, light, of, varying, colour, and, complexity, the, form, of, the, aurora, occurring, within, bands, around, both, polar, regions, is, also, dependent, on, the, amount, of, acceleration, imparted, to, the, precipitating, particles, most, of, the, planets, in, the, solar, system, some, natural, satellites, brown, dwarfs, and, even, comets, also, host, auroras, the, term, aurora, borealis, was, coined, by, galileo, in, 1619, from, the, roman, aurora, goddess, of, the, dawn, and, the, greek, boreas, god, of, the, cold, north, wind, the, word, aurora, is, derived, from, the, name, of, the, roman, goddess, of, the, dawn, aurora, who, travelled, from, east, to, west, announcing, the, coming, of, the, sun, ancient, greek, poets, used, the, corresponding, name, eos, metaphorically, to, refer, to, dawn, often, mentioning, its, play, of, colors, across, the, otherwise, dark, sky, e, g, rosy, fingered, dawn, the, words, borealis, and, australis, are, derived, from, the, names, of, the, ancient, gods, of, the, north, wind, boreas, and, the, south, wind, auster, in, greco, roman, mythology, most, auroras, occur, in, a, band, known, as, the, auroral, zone, which, is, typically, 3, to, 6, approximately, 330, 660, km, wide, in, latitude, and, between, 10, and, 20, from, the, geomagnetic, poles, at, all, local, times, or, longitudes, most, clearly, seen, at, night, against, a, dark, sky, a, region, that, currently, displays, an, aurora, is, called, the, auroral, oval, a, band, displaced, by, the, solar, wind, towards, the, night, side, of, earth, auroras, at, the, north, pole, itself, are, rare, due, to, it, being, on, the, arctic, ocean, while, auroras, at, the, south, pole, itself, are, very, common, and, guaranteed, to, be, visible, early, evidence, for, a, geomagnetic, connection, comes, from, the, statistics, of, auroral, observations, elias, loomis, 1860, and, later, hermann, fritz, 1881, and, sophus, tromholt, 1881, in, more, detail, established, that, the, aurora, appeared, mainly, in, the, auroral, zone, in, northern, latitudes, the, effect, is, known, as, the, aurora, borealis, or, the, northern, lights, the, southern, counterpart, the, aurora, australis, or, the, southern, lights, has, features, almost, identical, to, the, aurora, borealis, and, changes, simultaneously, with, changes, in, the, northern, auroral, zone, the, aurora, australis, is, visible, from, high, southern, latitudes, in, antarctica, the, southern, cone, south, africa, australasia, and, under, exceptional, circumstances, as, far, north, as, uruguay, the, aurora, borealis, is, visible, from, areas, around, the, arctic, such, as, alaska, canada, iceland, greenland, the, faroe, islands, scandinavia, scotland, and, russia, on, rare, occasions, the, aurora, borealis, can, be, seen, as, far, south, as, the, mediterranean, and, the, southern, states, of, the, us, during, the, carrington, event, the, greatest, geomagnetic, storm, ever, observed, auroras, were, seen, even, in, the, tropics, a, geomagnetic, storm, causes, the, auroral, ovals, north, and, south, to, expand, bringing, the, aurora, to, lower, latitudes, the, instantaneous, distribution, of, auroras, auroral, oval, is, slightly, different, being, centered, about, 3, 5, nightward, of, the, magnetic, pole, so, that, auroral, arcs, reach, furthest, toward, the, equator, when, the, magnetic, pole, in, question, is, in, between, the, observer, and, the, sun, the, aurora, can, be, seen, best, at, this, time, which, is, called, magnetic, midnight, auroras, seen, within, the, auroral, oval, may, be, directly, overhead, from, farther, away, they, illuminate, the, poleward, horizon, as, a, greenish, glow, or, sometimes, a, faint, red, as, if, the, sun, were, rising, from, an, unusual, direction, auroras, also, occur, poleward, of, the, auroral, zone, as, either, diffuse, patches, or, arcs, which, can, be, subvisual, auroras, are, occasionally, seen, in, latitudes, below, the, auroral, zone, when, a, geomagnetic, storm, temporarily, enlarges, the, auroral, oval, large, geomagnetic, storms, are, most, common, during, the, peak, of, the, 11, year, sunspot, cycle, or, during, the, three, years, after, the, peak, an, electron, spirals, gyrates, about, a, field, line, at, an, angle, that, is, determined, by, its, velocity, vectors, parallel, and, perpendicular, respectively, to, the, local, geomagnetic, field, vector, b, this, angle, is, known, as, the, pitch, angle, of, the, particle, the, distance, or, radius, of, the, electron, from, the, field, line, at, any, time, is, known, as, its, larmor, radius, the, pitch, angle, increases, as, the, electron, travels, to, a, region, of, greater, field, strength, nearer, to, the, atmosphere, thus, it, is, possible, for, some, particles, to, return, or, mirror, if, the, angle, becomes, 90, before, entering, the, atmosphere, to, collide, with, the, denser, molecules, there, other, particles, that, do, not, mirror, enter, the, atmosphere, and, contribute, to, the, auroral, display, over, a, range, of, altitudes, other, types, of, auroras, have, been, observed, from, space, for, example, poleward, arcs, stretching, sunward, across, the, polar, cap, the, related, theta, aurora, and, dayside, arcs, near, noon, these, are, relatively, infrequent, and, poorly, understood, other, interesting, effects, occur, such, as, pulsating, aurora, black, aurora, and, their, rarer, companion, anti, black, aurora, and, subvisual, red, arcs, in, addition, to, all, these, a, weak, glow, often, deep, red, observed, around, the, two, polar, cusps, the, field, lines, separating, the, ones, that, close, through, earth, from, those, that, are, swept, into, the, tail, and, close, remotely, early, work, on, the, imaging, of, the, auroras, was, done, in, 1949, by, the, university, of, saskatchewan, using, the, scr, 270, radar, the, altitudes, where, auroral, emissions, occur, were, revealed, by, carl, st, rmer, and, his, colleagues, who, used, cameras, to, triangulate, more, than, 12, 000, auroras, they, discovered, that, most, of, the, light, is, produced, between, 90, and, 150, km, 56, and, 93, mi, above, the, ground, while, extending, at, times, to, more, than, 1, 000, km, 620, mi, according, to, clark, 2007, there, are, five, main, forms, that, can, be, seen, from, the, ground, from, least, to, most, visible, brekke, 1994, also, described, some, auroras, as, curtains, the, similarity, to, curtains, is, often, enhanced, by, folds, within, the, arcs, arcs, can, fragment, or, break, up, into, separate, at, times, rapidly, changing, often, rayed, features, that, may, fill, the, whole, sky, these, are, also, known, as, discrete, auroras, which, are, at, times, bright, enough, to, read, a, newspaper, by, at, night, these, forms, are, consistent, with, auroras, being, shaped, by, earth, s, magnetic, field, the, appearances, of, arcs, rays, curtains, and, coronas, are, determined, by, the, shapes, of, the, luminous, parts, of, the, atmosphere, and, a, viewer, s, position, auroras, change, with, time, over, the, night, they, begin, with, glows, and, progress, toward, coronas, although, they, may, not, reach, them, they, tend, to, fade, in, the, opposite, order, until, about, 1963, it, was, thought, that, these, changes, are, due, to, the, rotation, of, the, earth, under, a, pattern, fixed, with, respect, to, the, sun, later, it, was, found, by, comparing, all, sky, films, of, auroras, from, different, places, collected, during, the, international, geophysical, year, that, they, often, undergo, global, changes, in, a, process, called, auroral, substorm, they, change, in, a, few, minutes, from, quiet, arcs, all, along, the, auroral, oval, to, active, displays, along, the, darkside, and, after, 1, 3, hours, they, gradually, change, back, changes, in, auroras, over, time, are, commonly, visualized, using, keograms, at, shorter, time, scales, auroras, can, change, their, appearances, and, intensity, sometimes, so, slowly, as, to, be, difficult, to, notice, and, at, other, times, rapidly, down, to, the, sub, second, scale, the, phenomenon, of, pulsating, auroras, is, an, example, of, intensity, variations, over, short, timescales, typically, with, periods, of, 2, 20, seconds, this, type, of, aurora, is, generally, accompanied, by, decreasing, peak, emission, heights, of, about, 8, km, for, blue, and, green, emissions, and, above, average, solar, wind, speeds, c, 500, km, s, in, addition, the, aurora, and, associated, currents, produce, a, strong, radio, emission, around, 150, khz, known, as, auroral, kilometric, radiation, akr, discovered, in, 1972, ionospheric, absorption, makes, akr, only, observable, from, space, x, ray, emissions, originating, from, the, particles, associated, with, auroras, have, also, been, detected, aurora, noise, similar, to, a, crackling, noise, begins, about, 70, m, 230, ft, above, earth, s, surface, and, is, caused, by, charged, particles, in, an, inversion, layer, of, the, atmosphere, formed, during, a, cold, night, the, charged, particles, discharge, when, particles, from, the, sun, hit, the, inversion, layer, creating, the, noise, in, 2016, more, than, fifty, citizen, science, observations, described, what, was, to, them, an, unknown, type, of, aurora, which, they, named, steve, for, strong, thermal, emission, velocity, enhancement, steve, is, not, an, aurora, but, is, caused, by, a, 25, km, 16, mi, wide, ribbon, of, hot, plasma, at, an, altitude, of, 450, km, 280, mi, with, a, temperature, of, 3, 000, c, 3, 270, k, 5, 430, f, and, flowing, at, a, speed, of, 6, km, s, 3, 7, mi, s, compared, to, 10, m, s, 33, ft, s, outside, the, ribbon, the, processes, that, cause, steve, are, also, associated, with, a, picket, fence, aurora, although, the, latter, can, be, seen, without, steve, it, is, an, aurora, because, it, is, caused, by, precipitation, of, electrons, in, the, atmosphere, but, it, appears, outside, the, auroral, oval, closer, to, the, equator, than, typical, auroras, when, the, picket, fence, aurora, appears, with, steve, it, is, below, first, reported, in, 2020, and, confirmed, in, 2021, the, dune, aurora, phenomenon, was, discovered, by, finnish, citizen, scientists, it, consists, of, regularly, spaced, parallel, stripes, of, brighter, emission, in, the, green, diffuse, aurora, which, give, the, impression, of, sand, dunes, the, phenomenon, is, believed, to, be, caused, by, the, modulation, of, atomic, oxygen, density, by, a, large, scale, atmospheric, wave, travelling, horizontally, in, a, waveguide, through, an, inversion, layer, in, the, mesosphere, in, presence, of, electron, precipitation, horse, collar, auroras, hca, are, auroral, features, in, which, the, auroral, ellipse, shifts, poleward, during, the, dawn, and, dusk, portions, and, the, polar, cap, becomes, teardrop, shaped, they, form, during, periods, when, the, interplanetary, magnetic, field, imf, is, permanently, northward, when, the, imf, clock, angle, is, small, their, formation, is, associated, with, the, closure, of, the, magnetic, flux, at, the, top, of, the, dayside, magnetosphere, by, the, double, lobe, reconnection, dlr, there, are, approximately, 8, hca, events, per, month, with, no, seasonal, dependence, and, that, the, imf, must, be, within, 30, degrees, of, northwards, conjugate, auroras, are, nearly, exact, mirror, image, auroras, found, at, conjugate, points, in, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, on, the, same, geomagnetic, field, lines, these, generally, happen, at, the, time, of, the, equinoxes, when, there, is, little, difference, in, the, orientation, of, the, north, and, south, geomagnetic, poles, to, the, sun, attempts, were, made, to, image, conjugate, auroras, by, aircraft, from, alaska, and, new, zealand, in, 1967, 1968, 1970, and, 1971, with, some, success, a, full, understanding, of, the, physical, processes, which, lead, to, different, types, of, auroras, is, still, incomplete, but, the, basic, cause, involves, the, interaction, of, the, solar, wind, with, earth, s, magnetosphere, the, varying, intensity, of, the, solar, wind, produces, effects, of, different, magnitudes, but, includes, one, or, more, of, the, following, physical, scenarios, the, details, of, these, phenomena, are, not, fully, understood, however, it, is, clear, that, the, prime, source, of, auroral, particles, is, the, solar, wind, feeding, the, magnetosphere, the, reservoir, containing, the, radiation, zones, and, temporarily, magnetically, trapped, particles, confined, by, the, geomagnetic, field, coupled, with, particle, acceleration, processes, the, immediate, cause, of, the, ionization, and, excitation, of, atmospheric, constituents, leading, to, auroral, emissions, was, discovered, in, 1960, when, a, pioneering, rocket, flight, from, fort, churchill, in, canada, revealed, a, flux, of, electrons, entering, the, atmosphere, from, above, since, then, an, extensive, collection, of, measurements, has, been, acquired, painstakingly, and, with, steadily, improving, resolution, since, the, 1960s, by, many, research, teams, using, rockets, and, satellites, to, traverse, the, auroral, zone, the, main, findings, have, been, that, auroral, arcs, and, other, bright, forms, are, due, to, electrons, that, have, been, accelerated, during, the, final, few, 10, 000, km, or, so, of, their, plunge, into, the, atmosphere, these, electrons, often, but, not, always, exhibit, a, peak, in, their, energy, distribution, and, are, preferentially, aligned, along, the, local, direction, of, the, magnetic, field, electrons, mainly, responsible, for, diffuse, and, pulsating, auroras, have, in, contrast, a, smoothly, falling, energy, distribution, and, an, angular, pitch, angle, distribution, favouring, directions, perpendicular, to, the, local, magnetic, field, pulsations, were, discovered, to, originate, at, or, close, to, the, equatorial, crossing, point, of, auroral, zone, magnetic, field, lines, protons, are, also, associated, with, auroras, both, discrete, and, diffuse, auroras, result, from, emissions, of, photons, in, earth, s, upper, atmosphere, above, 80, km, 50, mi, from, ionized, nitrogen, atoms, regaining, an, electron, and, oxygen, atoms, and, nitrogen, based, molecules, returning, from, an, excited, state, to, ground, state, they, are, ionized, or, excited, by, the, collision, of, particles, precipitated, into, the, atmosphere, both, incoming, electrons, and, protons, may, be, involved, excitation, energy, is, lost, within, the, atmosphere, by, the, emission, of, a, photon, or, by, collision, with, another, atom, or, molecule, oxygen, is, unusual, in, terms, of, its, return, to, ground, state, it, can, take, 0, 7, seconds, to, emit, the, 557, 7, nm, green, light, and, up, to, two, minutes, for, the, red, 630, 0, nm, emission, collisions, with, other, atoms, or, molecules, absorb, the, excitation, energy, and, prevent, emission, this, process, is, called, collisional, quenching, because, the, highest, parts, of, the, atmosphere, contain, a, higher, percentage, of, oxygen, and, lower, particle, densities, such, collisions, are, rare, enough, to, allow, time, for, oxygen, to, emit, red, light, collisions, become, more, frequent, progressing, down, into, the, atmosphere, due, to, increasing, density, so, that, red, emissions, do, not, have, time, to, happen, and, eventually, even, green, light, emissions, are, prevented, this, is, why, there, is, a, color, differential, with, altitude, at, high, altitudes, oxygen, red, dominates, then, oxygen, green, and, nitrogen, blue, purple, red, then, finally, nitrogen, blue, purple, red, when, collisions, prevent, oxygen, from, emitting, anything, green, is, the, most, common, color, then, comes, pink, a, mixture, of, light, green, and, red, followed, by, pure, red, then, yellow, a, mixture, of, red, and, green, and, finally, pure, blue, precipitating, protons, generally, produce, optical, emissions, as, incident, hydrogen, atoms, after, gaining, electrons, from, the, atmosphere, proton, auroras, are, usually, observed, at, lower, latitudes, bright, auroras, are, generally, associated, with, birkeland, currents, schield, et, al, 1969, zmuda, and, armstrong, 1973, which, flow, down, into, the, ionosphere, on, one, side, of, the, pole, and, out, on, the, other, in, between, some, of, the, current, connects, directly, through, the, ionospheric, e, layer, 125, km, the, rest, region, 2, detours, leaving, again, through, field, lines, closer, to, the, equator, and, closing, through, the, partial, ring, current, carried, by, magnetically, trapped, plasma, the, ionosphere, is, an, ohmic, conductor, so, some, consider, that, such, currents, require, a, driving, voltage, which, an, as, yet, unspecified, dynamo, mechanism, can, supply, electric, field, probes, in, orbit, above, the, polar, cap, suggest, voltages, of, the, order, of, 40, 000, volts, rising, up, to, more, than, 200, 000, volts, during, intense, magnetic, storms, in, another, interpretation, the, currents, are, the, direct, result, of, electron, acceleration, into, the, atmosphere, by, wave, particle, interactions, ionospheric, resistance, has, a, complex, nature, and, leads, to, a, secondary, hall, current, flow, by, a, strange, twist, of, physics, the, magnetic, disturbance, on, the, ground, due, to, the, main, current, almost, cancels, out, so, most, of, the, observed, effect, of, auroras, is, due, to, a, secondary, current, the, auroral, electrojet, an, auroral, electrojet, index, measured, in, nanotesla, is, regularly, derived, from, ground, data, and, serves, as, a, general, measure, of, auroral, activity, kristian, birkeland, deduced, that, the, currents, flowed, in, the, east, west, directions, along, the, auroral, arc, and, such, currents, flowing, from, the, dayside, toward, approximately, midnight, were, later, named, auroral, electrojets, see, also, birkeland, currents, ionosphere, can, contribute, to, the, formation, of, auroral, arcs, via, the, feedback, instability, under, high, ionospheric, resistance, conditions, observed, at, night, time, and, in, dark, winter, hemisphere, earth, is, constantly, immersed, in, the, solar, wind, a, flow, of, magnetized, hot, plasma, a, gas, of, free, electrons, and, positive, ions, emitted, by, the, sun, in, all, directions, a, result, of, the, two, million, degree, temperature, of, the, sun, s, outermost, layer, the, corona, the, solar, wind, reaches, earth, with, a, velocity, typically, around, 400, km, s, a, density, of, around, 5, ions, cm, 3, and, a, magnetic, field, intensity, of, around, 2, 5, nt, for, comparison, earth, s, surface, field, is, typically, 30, 000, 50, 000, nt, during, magnetic, storms, in, particular, flows, can, be, several, times, faster, the, interplanetary, magnetic, field, imf, may, also, be, much, stronger, joan, feynman, deduced, in, the, 1970s, that, the, long, term, averages, of, solar, wind, speed, correlated, with, geomagnetic, activity, her, work, resulted, from, data, collected, by, the, explorer, 33, spacecraft, the, solar, wind, and, magnetosphere, consist, of, plasma, ionized, gas, which, conducts, electricity, it, is, well, known, since, michael, faraday, s, work, around, 1830, that, when, an, electrical, conductor, is, placed, within, a, magnetic, field, while, relative, motion, occurs, in, a, direction, that, the, conductor, cuts, across, or, is, cut, by, rather, than, along, the, lines, of, the, magnetic, field, an, electric, current, is, induced, within, the, conductor, the, strength, of, the, current, depends, on, a, the, rate, of, relative, motion, b, the, strength, of, the, magnetic, field, c, the, number, of, conductors, ganged, together, and, d, the, distance, between, the, conductor, and, the, magnetic, field, while, the, direction, of, flow, is, dependent, upon, the, direction, of, relative, motion, dynamos, make, use, of, this, basic, process, the, dynamo, effect, any, and, all, conductors, solid, or, otherwise, are, so, affected, including, plasmas, and, other, fluids, the, imf, originates, on, the, sun, linked, to, the, sunspots, and, its, field, lines, lines, of, force, are, dragged, out, by, the, solar, wind, that, alone, would, tend, to, line, them, up, in, the, sun, earth, direction, but, the, rotation, of, the, sun, angles, them, at, earth, by, about, 45, degrees, forming, a, spiral, in, the, ecliptic, plane, known, as, the, parker, spiral, the, field, lines, passing, earth, are, therefore, usually, linked, to, those, near, the, western, edge, limb, of, the, visible, sun, at, any, time, the, solar, wind, and, the, magnetosphere, being, two, electrically, conducting, fluids, in, relative, motion, should, be, able, in, principle, to, generate, electric, currents, by, dynamo, action, and, impart, energy, from, the, flow, of, the, solar, wind, however, this, process, is, hampered, by, the, fact, that, plasmas, conduct, readily, along, magnetic, field, lines, but, less, readily, perpendicular, to, them, energy, is, more, effectively, transferred, by, the, temporary, magnetic, connection, between, the, field, lines, of, the, solar, wind, and, those, of, the, magnetosphere, unsurprisingly, this, process, is, known, as, magnetic, reconnection, as, already, mentioned, it, happens, most, readily, when, the, interplanetary, field, is, directed, southward, in, a, similar, direction, to, the, geomagnetic, field, in, the, inner, regions, of, both, the, north, magnetic, pole, and, south, magnetic, pole, auroras, are, more, frequent, and, brighter, during, the, intense, phase, of, the, solar, cycle, when, coronal, mass, ejections, increase, the, intensity, of, the, solar, wind, earth, s, magnetosphere, is, shaped, by, the, impact, of, the, solar, wind, on, earth, s, magnetic, field, this, forms, an, obstacle, to, the, flow, diverting, it, at, an, average, distance, of, about, 70, 000, km, 11, earth, radii, or, re, producing, a, bow, shock, 12, 000, km, to, 15, 000, km, 1, 9, to, 2, 4, re, further, upstream, the, width, of, the, magnetosphere, abreast, of, earth, is, typically, 190, 000, km, 30, re, and, on, the, night, side, a, long, magnetotail, of, stretched, field, lines, extends, to, great, distances, 200, re, the, high, latitude, magnetosphere, is, filled, with, plasma, as, the, solar, wind, passes, earth, the, flow, of, plasma, into, the, magnetosphere, increases, with, additional, turbulence, density, and, speed, in, the, solar, wind, this, flow, is, favored, by, a, southward, component, of, the, imf, which, can, then, directly, connect, to, the, high, latitude, geomagnetic, field, lines, the, flow, pattern, of, magnetospheric, plasma, is, mainly, from, the, magnetotail, toward, earth, around, earth, and, back, into, the, solar, wind, through, the, magnetopause, on, the, day, side, in, addition, to, moving, perpendicular, to, earth, s, magnetic, field, some, magnetospheric, plasma, travels, down, along, earth, s, magnetic, field, lines, gains, additional, energy, and, loses, it, to, the, atmosphere, in, the, auroral, zones, the, cusps, of, the, magnetosphere, separating, geomagnetic, field, lines, that, close, through, earth, from, those, that, close, remotely, allow, a, small, amount, of, solar, wind, to, directly, reach, the, top, of, the, atmosphere, producing, an, auroral, glow, on, 26, february, 2008, themis, probes, were, able, to, determine, for, the, first, time, the, triggering, event, for, the, onset, of, magnetospheric, substorms, two, of, the, five, probes, positioned, approximately, one, third, the, distance, to, the, moon, measured, events, suggesting, a, magnetic, reconnection, event, 96, seconds, prior, to, auroral, intensification, geomagnetic, storms, that, ignite, auroras, may, occur, more, often, during, the, months, around, the, equinoxes, it, is, not, well, understood, but, geomagnetic, storms, may, vary, with, earth, s, seasons, two, factors, to, consider, are, the, tilt, of, both, the, solar, and, earth, s, axis, to, the, ecliptic, plane, as, earth, orbits, throughout, a, year, it, experiences, an, interplanetary, magnetic, field, imf, from, different, latitudes, of, the, sun, which, is, tilted, at, 8, degrees, similarly, the, 23, degree, tilt, of, earth, s, axis, about, which, the, geomagnetic, pole, rotates, with, a, diurnal, variation, changes, the, daily, average, angle, that, the, geomagnetic, field, presents, to, the, incident, imf, throughout, a, year, these, factors, combined, can, lead, to, minor, cyclical, changes, in, the, detailed, way, that, the, imf, links, to, the, magnetosphere, in, turn, this, affects, the, average, probability, of, opening, a, door, through, which, energy, from, the, solar, wind, can, reach, earth, s, inner, magnetosphere, and, thereby, enhance, auroras, recent, evidence, in, 2021, has, shown, that, individual, separate, substorms, may, in, fact, be, correlated, networked, communities, just, as, there, are, many, types, of, aurora, there, are, many, different, mechanisms, that, accelerate, auroral, particles, into, the, atmosphere, electron, aurora, in, earth, s, auroral, zone, i, e, commonly, visible, aurora, can, be, split, into, two, main, categories, with, different, immediate, causes, diffuse, and, discrete, aurora, diffuse, aurora, appear, relatively, structureless, to, an, observer, on, the, ground, with, indistinct, edges, and, amorphous, forms, discrete, aurora, are, structured, into, distinct, features, with, well, defined, edges, such, as, arcs, rays, and, coronas, they, also, tend, to, be, much, brighter, than, the, diffuse, aurora, in, both, cases, the, electrons, that, eventually, cause, the, aurora, start, out, as, electrons, trapped, by, the, magnetic, field, in, earth, s, magnetosphere, these, trapped, particles, bounce, back, and, forth, along, magnetic, field, lines, and, are, prevented, from, hitting, the, atmosphere, by, the, magnetic, mirror, formed, by, the, increasing, magnetic, field, strength, closer, to, earth, the, magnetic, mirror, s, ability, to, trap, a, particle, depends, on, the, particle, s, pitch, angle, the, angle, between, its, direction, of, motion, and, the, local, magnetic, field, an, aurora, is, created, by, processes, that, decrease, the, pitch, angle, of, many, individual, electrons, freeing, them, from, the, magnetic, trap, and, causing, them, to, hit, the, atmosphere, in, the, case, of, diffuse, auroras, the, electron, pitch, angles, are, altered, by, their, interaction, with, various, plasma, waves, each, interaction, is, essentially, wave, particle, scattering, the, electron, energy, after, interacting, with, the, wave, is, similar, to, its, energy, before, interaction, but, the, direction, of, motion, is, altered, if, the, final, direction, of, motion, after, scattering, is, close, to, the, field, line, specifically, if, it, falls, within, the, loss, cone, then, the, electron, will, hit, the, atmosphere, diffuse, auroras, are, caused, by, the, collective, effect, of, many, such, scattered, electrons, hitting, the, atmosphere, the, process, is, mediated, by, the, plasma, waves, which, become, stronger, during, periods, of, high, geomagnetic, activity, leading, to, increased, diffuse, aurora, at, those, times, in, the, case, of, discrete, auroras, the, trapped, electrons, are, accelerated, toward, earth, by, electric, fields, that, form, at, an, altitude, of, about, 4000, 12000, km, in, the, auroral, acceleration, region, the, electric, fields, point, away, from, earth, i, e, upward, along, the, magnetic, field, line, electrons, moving, downward, through, these, fields, gain, a, substantial, amount, of, energy, on, the, order, of, a, few, kev, in, the, direction, along, the, magnetic, field, line, toward, earth, this, field, aligned, acceleration, decreases, the, pitch, angle, for, all, of, the, electrons, passing, through, the, region, causing, many, of, them, to, hit, the, upper, atmosphere, in, contrast, to, the, scattering, process, leading, to, diffuse, auroras, the, electric, field, increases, the, kinetic, energy, of, all, of, the, electrons, transiting, downward, through, the, acceleration, region, by, the, same, amount, this, accelerates, electrons, starting, from, the, magnetosphere, with, initially, low, energies, tens, of, ev, or, less, to, energies, required, to, create, an, aurora, 100s, of, ev, or, greater, allowing, that, large, source, of, particles, to, contribute, to, creating, auroral, light, the, accelerated, electrons, carry, an, electric, current, along, the, magnetic, field, lines, a, birkeland, current, since, the, electric, field, points, in, the, same, direction, as, the, current, there, is, a, net, conversion, of, electromagnetic, energy, into, particle, energy, in, the, auroral, acceleration, region, an, electric, load, the, energy, to, power, this, load, is, eventually, supplied, by, the, magnetized, solar, wind, flowing, around, the, obstacle, of, earth, s, magnetic, field, although, exactly, how, that, power, flows, through, the, magnetosphere, is, still, an, active, area, of, research, while, the, energy, to, power, the, aurora, is, ultimately, derived, from, the, solar, wind, the, electrons, themselves, do, not, travel, directly, from, the, solar, wind, into, earth, s, auroral, zone, magnetic, field, lines, from, these, regions, do, not, connect, to, the, solar, wind, so, there, is, no, direct, access, for, solar, wind, electrons, some, auroral, features, are, also, created, by, electrons, accelerated, by, dispersive, alfv, n, waves, at, small, wavelengths, transverse, to, the, background, magnetic, field, comparable, to, the, electron, inertial, length, or, ion, gyroradius, alfv, n, waves, develop, a, significant, electric, field, parallel, to, the, background, magnetic, field, this, electric, field, can, accelerate, electrons, to, kev, energies, significant, to, produce, auroral, arcs, if, the, electrons, have, a, speed, close, to, that, of, the, wave, s, phase, velocity, they, are, accelerated, in, a, manner, analogous, to, a, surfer, catching, an, ocean, wave, this, constantly, changing, wave, electric, field, can, accelerate, electrons, along, the, field, line, causing, some, of, them, to, hit, the, atmosphere, electrons, accelerated, by, this, mechanism, tend, to, have, a, broad, energy, spectrum, in, contrast, to, the, sharply, peaked, energy, spectrum, typical, of, electrons, accelerated, by, quasi, static, electric, fields, in, addition, to, the, discrete, and, diffuse, electron, aurora, proton, aurora, is, caused, when, magnetospheric, protons, collide, with, the, upper, atmosphere, the, proton, gains, an, electron, in, the, interaction, and, the, resulting, neutral, hydrogen, atom, emits, photons, the, resulting, light, is, too, dim, to, be, seen, with, the, naked, eye, other, aurora, not, covered, by, the, above, discussion, include, transpolar, arcs, formed, poleward, of, the, auroral, zone, cusp, aurora, formed, in, two, small, high, latitude, areas, on, the, dayside, and, some, non, terrestrial, auroras, the, discovery, of, a, 1770, japanese, diary, in, 2017, depicting, auroras, above, the, ancient, japanese, capital, of, kyoto, suggested, that, the, storm, may, have, been, 7, larger, than, the, carrington, event, which, affected, telegraph, networks, the, auroras, that, resulted, from, the, carrington, event, on, both, 28, august, and, 2, september, 1859, are, thought, to, be, the, most, spectacular, in, recent, history, in, a, paper, to, the, royal, society, on, 21, november, 1861, balfour, stewart, described, both, auroral, events, as, documented, by, a, self, recording, magnetograph, at, the, kew, observatory, and, established, the, connection, between, the, 2, september, 1859, auroral, storm, and, the, carrington, hodgson, flare, event, when, he, observed, that, it, is, not, impossible, to, suppose, that, in, this, case, our, luminary, was, taken, in, the, act, the, second, auroral, event, which, occurred, on, 2, september, 1859, was, a, result, of, the, unseen, coronal, mass, ejection, associated, with, the, exceptionally, intense, carrington, hodgson, white, light, solar, flare, on, 1, september, 1859, this, event, produced, auroras, so, widespread, and, extraordinarily, bright, that, they, were, seen, and, reported, in, published, scientific, measurements, ship, logs, and, newspapers, throughout, the, united, states, europe, japan, and, australia, it, was, reported, by, the, new, york, times, that, in, boston, on, friday, 2, september, 1859, the, aurora, was, so, brilliant, that, at, about, one, o, clock, ordinary, print, could, be, read, by, the, light, one, o, clock, est, time, on, friday, 2, september, would, have, been, 6, 00, gmt, the, self, recording, magnetograph, at, the, kew, observatory, was, recording, the, geomagnetic, storm, which, was, then, one, hour, old, at, its, full, intensity, between, 1859, and, 1862, elias, loomis, published, a, series, of, nine, papers, on, the, great, auroral, exhibition, of, 1859, in, the, american, journal, of, science, where, he, collected, worldwide, reports, of, the, auroral, event, that, aurora, is, thought, to, have, been, produced, by, one, of, the, most, intense, coronal, mass, ejections, in, history, it, is, also, notable, for, the, fact, that, it, is, the, first, time, where, the, phenomena, of, auroral, activity, and, electricity, were, unambiguously, linked, this, insight, was, made, possible, not, only, due, to, scientific, magnetometer, measurements, of, the, era, but, also, as, a, result, of, a, significant, portion, of, the, 125, 000, miles, 201, 000, km, of, telegraph, lines, then, in, service, being, significantly, disrupted, for, many, hours, throughout, the, storm, some, telegraph, lines, however, seem, to, have, been, of, the, appropriate, length, and, orientation, to, produce, a, sufficient, geomagnetically, induced, current, from, the, electromagnetic, field, to, allow, for, continued, communication, with, the, telegraph, operator, power, supplies, switched, off, the, following, conversation, occurred, between, two, operators, of, the, american, telegraph, line, between, boston, and, portland, maine, on, the, night, of, 2, september, 1859, and, reported, in, the, boston, traveler, boston, operator, to, portland, operator, please, cut, off, your, battery, entirely, for, fifteen, minutes, portland, operator, will, do, so, it, is, now, disconnected, boston, mine, is, disconnected, and, we, are, working, with, the, auroral, current, how, do, you, receive, my, writing, portland, better, than, with, our, batteries, on, current, comes, and, goes, gradually, boston, my, current, is, very, strong, at, times, and, we, can, work, better, without, the, batteries, as, the, aurora, seems, to, neutralize, and, augment, our, batteries, alternately, making, current, too, strong, at, times, for, our, relay, magnets, suppose, we, work, without, batteries, while, we, are, affected, by, this, trouble, portland, very, well, shall, i, go, ahead, with, business, boston, yes, go, ahead, the, conversation, was, carried, on, for, around, two, hours, using, no, battery, power, at, all, and, working, solely, with, the, current, induced, by, the, aurora, and, it, was, said, that, this, was, the, first, time, on, record, that, more, than, a, word, or, two, was, transmitted, in, such, manner, such, events, led, to, the, general, conclusion, that, the, effect, of, the, aurora, on, the, electric, telegraph, is, generally, to, increase, or, diminish, the, electric, current, generated, in, working, the, wires, sometimes, it, entirely, neutralizes, them, so, that, in, effect, no, fluid, is, discoverable, in, them, the, aurora, borealis, seems, to, be, composed, of, a, mass, of, electric, matter, resembling, in, every, respect, that, generated, by, the, electric, galvanic, battery, the, currents, from, it, change, coming, on, the, wires, and, then, disappear, the, mass, of, the, aurora, rolls, from, the, horizon, to, the, zenith, in, may, 2024, a, series, of, solar, storms, caused, the, aurora, borealis, to, be, observed, from, as, far, south, as, ferdows, iran, the, earliest, datable, record, of, an, aurora, was, recorded, in, the, bamboo, annals, a, historical, chronicle, of, the, history, of, ancient, china, in, 977, or, 957, bc, an, aurora, was, described, by, the, greek, explorer, pytheas, in, the, 4th, century, bc, seneca, wrote, about, auroras, in, the, first, book, of, his, naturales, quaestiones, classifying, them, for, instance, as, pithaei, barrel, like, chasmata, chasm, pogoniae, bearded, cyparissae, like, cypress, trees, and, describing, their, manifold, colors, he, wrote, about, whether, they, were, above, or, below, the, clouds, and, recalled, that, under, tiberius, an, aurora, formed, above, the, port, city, of, ostia, that, was, so, intense, and, red, that, a, cohort, of, the, army, stationed, nearby, for, fire, duty, galloped, to, the, rescue, it, has, been, suggested, that, pliny, the, elder, depicted, the, aurora, borealis, in, his, natural, history, when, he, refers, to, trabes, chasma, falling, red, flames, and, daylight, in, the, night, the, earliest, depiction, of, the, aurora, may, have, been, in, cro, magnon, cave, paintings, of, northern, spain, dating, to, 30, 000, bc, the, oldest, known, written, record, of, the, aurora, was, in, a, chinese, legend, written, around, 2600, bc, on, an, autumn, around, 2000, bc, according, to, a, legend, a, young, woman, named, fubao, was, sitting, alone, in, the, wilderness, by, a, bay, when, suddenly, a, magical, band, of, light, appeared, like, moving, clouds, and, flowing, water, turning, into, a, bright, halo, around, the, big, dipper, which, cascaded, a, pale, silver, brilliance, illuminating, the, earth, and, making, shapes, and, shadows, seem, alive, moved, by, this, sight, fubao, became, pregnant, and, gave, birth, to, a, son, the, emperor, xuanyuan, known, legendarily, as, the, initiator, of, chinese, culture, and, the, ancestor, of, all, chinese, people, in, the, shanhaijing, a, creature, named, shilong, is, described, to, be, like, a, red, dragon, shining, in, the, night, sky, with, a, body, a, thousand, miles, long, in, ancient, times, the, chinese, did, not, have, a, fixed, word, for, the, aurora, so, it, was, named, according, to, the, different, shapes, of, the, aurora, such, as, sky, dog, sword, knife, star, chiyou, banner, sky, s, open, eyes, and, stars, like, rain, in, japanese, folklore, pheasants, were, considered, messengers, from, heaven, however, researchers, from, japan, s, graduate, university, for, advanced, studies, and, national, institute, of, polar, research, claimed, in, march, 2020, that, red, pheasant, tails, witnessed, across, the, night, sky, over, japan, in, 620, a, d, might, be, a, red, aurora, produced, during, a, magnetic, storm, in, the, traditions, of, aboriginal, australians, the, aurora, australis, is, commonly, associated, with, fire, for, example, the, gunditjmara, people, of, western, victoria, called, auroras, puae, buae, ashes, while, the, gunai, people, of, eastern, victoria, perceived, auroras, as, bushfires, in, the, spirit, world, the, dieri, people, of, south, australia, say, that, an, auroral, display, is, kootchee, an, evil, spirit, creating, a, large, fire, similarly, the, ngarrindjeri, people, of, south, australia, refer, to, auroras, seen, over, kangaroo, island, as, the, campfires, of, spirits, in, the, land, of, the, dead, aboriginal, people, in, southwest, queensland, believe, the, auroras, to, be, the, fires, of, the, oola, pikka, ghostly, spirits, who, spoke, to, the, people, through, auroras, sacred, law, forbade, anyone, except, male, elders, from, watching, or, interpreting, the, messages, of, ancestors, they, believed, were, transmitted, through, an, aurora, among, the, m, ori, people, of, new, zealand, aurora, australis, or, tahunui, a, rangi, great, torches, in, the, sky, were, alight, by, ancestors, who, sailed, south, to, a, land, of, ice, or, their, descendants, these, people, were, said, to, be, ui, te, rangiora, s, expedition, party, who, had, reached, the, southern, ocean, around, the, 7th, century, in, scandinavia, the, first, mention, of, nor, rlj, s, the, northern, lights, is, found, in, the, norwegian, chronicle, konungs, skuggsj, from, ad, 1230, the, chronicler, has, heard, about, this, phenomenon, from, compatriots, returning, from, greenland, and, he, gives, three, possible, explanations, that, the, ocean, was, surrounded, by, vast, fires, that, the, sun, flares, could, reach, around, the, world, to, its, night, side, or, that, glaciers, could, store, energy, so, that, they, eventually, became, fluorescent, walter, william, bryant, wrote, in, his, book, kepler, 1920, that, tycho, brahe, seems, to, have, been, something, of, a, hom, opathist, for, he, recommends, sulfur, to, cure, infectious, diseases, brought, on, by, the, sulphurous, vapours, of, the, aurora, borealis, in, 1778, benjamin, franklin, theorized, in, his, paper, aurora, borealis, suppositions, and, conjectures, towards, forming, an, hypothesis, for, its, explanation, that, an, aurora, was, caused, by, a, concentration, of, electrical, charge, in, the, polar, regions, intensified, by, the, snow, and, moisture, in, the, air, may, not, then, the, great, quantity, of, electricity, brought, into, the, polar, regions, by, the, clouds, which, are, condens, d, there, and, fall, in, snow, which, electricity, would, enter, the, earth, but, cannot, penetrate, the, ice, may, it, not, i, say, as, a, bottle, overcharged, break, thro, that, low, atmosphere, and, run, along, in, the, vacuum, over, the, air, towards, the, equator, diverging, as, the, degrees, of, longitude, enlarge, strongly, visible, where, densest, and, becoming, less, visible, as, it, more, diverges, till, it, finds, a, passage, to, the, earth, in, more, temperate, climates, or, is, mingled, with, the, upper, air, observations, of, the, rhythmic, movement, of, compass, needles, due, to, the, influence, of, an, aurora, were, confirmed, in, the, swedish, city, of, uppsala, by, anders, celsius, and, olof, hiorter, in, 1741, hiorter, was, able, to, link, large, magnetic, fluctuations, with, an, aurora, being, observed, overhead, this, evidence, helped, to, support, their, theory, that, magnetic, storms, are, responsible, for, such, compass, fluctuations, a, variety, of, native, american, myths, surround, the, spectacle, the, european, explorer, samuel, hearne, traveled, with, chipewyan, dene, in, 1771, and, recorded, their, views, on, the, ed, thin, caribou, according, to, hearne, the, dene, people, saw, the, resemblance, between, an, aurora, and, the, sparks, produced, when, caribou, fur, is, stroked, they, believed, that, the, lights, were, the, spirits, of, their, departed, friends, dancing, in, the, sky, and, when, they, shone, brightly, it, meant, that, their, deceased, friends, were, very, happy, during, the, night, after, the, battle, of, fredericksburg, an, aurora, was, seen, from, the, battlefield, the, confederate, army, took, this, as, a, sign, that, god, was, on, their, side, as, the, lights, were, rarely, seen, so, far, south, the, painting, aurora, borealis, by, frederic, edwin, church, is, widely, interpreted, to, represent, the, conflict, of, the, american, civil, war, a, mid, 19th, century, british, source, says, auroras, were, a, rare, occurrence, before, the, 18th, century, it, quotes, halley, as, saying, that, before, the, aurora, of, 1716, no, such, phenomenon, had, been, recorded, for, more, than, 80, years, and, none, of, any, consequence, since, 1574, it, says, no, appearance, is, recorded, in, the, transactions, of, the, french, academy, of, sciences, between, 1666, and, 1716, and, that, one, aurora, recorded, in, berlin, miscellany, for, 1797, was, called, a, very, rare, event, one, observed, in, 1723, at, bologna, was, stated, to, be, the, first, ever, seen, there, celsius, 1733, states, the, oldest, residents, of, uppsala, thought, the, phenomenon, a, great, rarity, before, 1716, the, period, between, approximately, 1645, and, 1715, corresponds, to, the, maunder, minimum, in, sunspot, activity, in, robert, w, service, s, satirical, poem, the, ballad, of, the, northern, lights, 1908, a, yukon, prospector, discovers, that, the, aurora, is, the, glow, from, a, radium, mine, he, stakes, his, claim, then, goes, to, town, looking, for, investors, in, the, early, 1900s, the, norwegian, scientist, kristian, birkeland, laid, the, foundation, for, current, understanding, of, geomagnetism, and, polar, auroras, in, sami, mythology, the, northern, lights, are, caused, by, the, deceased, who, bled, to, death, cutting, themselves, their, blood, spilling, on, the, sky, many, aboriginal, peoples, of, northern, eurasia, and, north, america, share, similar, beliefs, of, northern, lights, being, the, blood, of, the, deceased, some, believing, they, are, caused, by, dead, warriors, blood, spraying, on, the, sky, as, they, engage, in, playing, games, riding, horses, or, having, fun, in, some, other, way, both, jupiter, and, saturn, have, magnetic, fields, that, are, stronger, than, earth, s, jupiter, s, equatorial, field, strength, is, 4, 3, gauss, compared, to, 0, 3, gauss, for, earth, and, both, have, extensive, radiation, belts, auroras, have, been, observed, on, both, gas, planets, most, clearly, using, the, hubble, space, telescope, and, the, cassini, and, galileo, spacecraft, as, well, as, on, uranus, and, neptune, the, aurorae, on, saturn, seem, like, earth, s, to, be, powered, by, the, solar, wind, however, jupiter, s, aurorae, are, more, complex, jupiter, s, main, auroral, oval, is, associated, with, the, plasma, produced, by, the, volcanic, moon, io, and, the, transport, of, this, plasma, within, the, planet, s, magnetosphere, an, uncertain, fraction, of, jupiter, s, aurorae, are, powered, by, the, solar, wind, in, addition, the, moons, especially, io, are, also, powerful, sources, of, aurora, these, arise, from, electric, currents, along, field, lines, field, aligned, currents, generated, by, a, dynamo, mechanism, due, to, the, relative, motion, between, the, rotating, planet, and, the, moving, moon, io, which, has, active, volcanism, and, an, ionosphere, is, a, particularly, strong, source, and, its, currents, also, generate, radio, emissions, which, have, been, studied, since, 1955, using, the, hubble, space, telescope, auroras, over, io, europa, and, ganymede, have, all, been, observed, auroras, have, also, been, observed, on, venus, and, mars, venus, has, no, magnetic, field, and, so, venusian, auroras, appear, as, bright, and, diffuse, patches, of, varying, shape, and, intensity, sometimes, distributed, over, the, full, disc, of, the, planet, a, venusian, aurora, originates, when, electrons, from, the, solar, wind, collide, with, the, night, side, atmosphere, an, aurora, was, detected, on, mars, on, 14, august, 2004, by, the, spicam, instrument, aboard, mars, express, the, aurora, was, located, at, terra, cimmeria, in, the, region, of, 177, east, 52, south, the, total, size, of, the, emission, region, was, about, 30, km, across, and, possibly, about, 8, km, high, by, analyzing, a, map, of, crustal, magnetic, anomalies, compiled, with, data, from, mars, global, surveyor, scientists, observed, that, the, region, of, the, emissions, corresponded, to, an, area, where, the, strongest, magnetic, field, is, localized, this, correlation, indicated, that, the, origin, of, the, light, emission, was, a, flux, of, electrons, moving, along, the, crust, magnetic, lines, and, exciting, the, upper, atmosphere, of, mars, between, 2014, and, 2016, cometary, auroras, were, observed, on, comet, 67p, churyumov, gerasimenko, by, multiple, instruments, on, the, rosetta, spacecraft, the, auroras, were, observed, at, far, ultraviolet, wavelengths, coma, observations, revealed, atomic, emissions, of, hydrogen, and, oxygen, caused, by, the, photodissociation, not, photoionization, like, in, terrestrial, auroras, of, water, molecules, in, the, comet, s, coma, the, interaction, of, accelerated, electrons, from, the, solar, wind, with, gas, particles, in, the, coma, is, responsible, for, the, aurora, since, comet, 67p, has, no, magnetic, field, the, aurora, is, diffusely, spread, around, the, comet, exoplanets, such, as, hot, jupiters, have, been, suggested, to, experience, ionization, in, their, upper, atmospheres, and, generate, an, aurora, modified, by, weather, in, their, turbulent, tropospheres, however, there, is, no, current, detection, of, an, exoplanet, aurora, the, first, ever, extra, solar, auroras, were, discovered, in, july, 2015, over, the, brown, dwarf, star, lsr, j1835, 3259, the, mainly, red, aurora, was, found, to, be, a, million, times, brighter, than, the, northern, lights, a, result, of, the, charged, particles, interacting, with, hydrogen, in, the, atmosphere, it, has, been, speculated, that, stellar, winds, may, be, stripping, off, material, from, the, surface, of, the, brown, dwarf, to, produce, their, own, electrons, another, possible, explanation, for, the, auroras, is, that, an, as, yet, undetected, body, around, the, dwarf, star, is, throwing, off, material, as, is, the, case, with, jupiter, and, its, moon, io
