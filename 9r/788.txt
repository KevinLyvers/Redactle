oceanography, from, ancient, greek, kean, s, ocean, and, graph, writing, also, known, as, oceanology, sea, science, ocean, science, and, marine, science, is, the, scientific, study, of, the, ocean, it, is, an, earth, science, which, covers, a, wide, range, of, topics, including, ecosystem, dynamics, ocean, currents, waves, and, geophysical, fluid, dynamics, plate, tectonics, and, seabed, geology, and, fluxes, of, various, chemical, substances, and, physical, properties, within, the, ocean, and, across, its, boundaries, these, diverse, topics, reflect, multiple, disciplines, that, oceanographers, utilize, to, glean, further, knowledge, of, the, world, ocean, including, astronomy, biology, chemistry, geography, geology, hydrology, meteorology, and, physics, paleoceanography, studies, the, history, of, the, oceans, in, the, geologic, past, an, oceanographer, is, a, person, who, studies, many, matters, concerned, with, oceans, including, marine, geology, physics, chemistry, and, biology, humans, first, acquired, knowledge, of, the, waves, and, currents, of, the, seas, and, oceans, in, pre, historic, times, observations, on, tides, were, recorded, by, aristotle, and, strabo, in, 384, 322, bc, early, exploration, of, the, oceans, was, primarily, for, cartography, and, mainly, limited, to, its, surfaces, and, of, the, animals, that, fishermen, brought, up, in, nets, though, depth, soundings, by, lead, line, were, taken, the, portuguese, campaign, of, atlantic, navigation, is, the, earliest, example, of, a, systematic, scientific, large, project, sustained, over, many, decades, studying, the, currents, and, winds, of, the, atlantic, the, work, of, pedro, nunes, 1502, 1578, is, remembered, in, the, navigation, context, for, the, determination, of, the, loxodromic, curve, the, shortest, course, between, two, points, on, the, surface, of, a, sphere, represented, onto, a, two, dimensional, map, when, he, published, his, treatise, of, the, sphere, 1537, mostly, a, commentated, translation, of, earlier, work, by, others, he, included, a, treatise, on, geometrical, and, astronomic, methods, of, navigation, there, he, states, clearly, that, portuguese, navigations, were, not, an, adventurous, endeavour, nam, se, fezeram, indo, a, acertar, mas, partiam, os, nossos, mareantes, muy, ensinados, e, prouidos, de, estromentos, e, regras, de, astrologia, e, geometria, que, sam, as, cousas, que, os, cosmographos, ham, dadar, apercebidas, e, leuaua, cartas, muy, particularmente, rumadas, e, na, ja, as, de, que, os, antigos, vsauam, were, not, done, by, chance, but, our, seafarers, departed, well, taught, and, provided, with, instruments, and, rules, of, astrology, astronomy, and, geometry, which, were, matters, the, cosmographers, would, provide, and, they, took, charts, with, exact, routes, and, no, longer, those, used, by, the, ancient, his, credibility, rests, on, being, personally, involved, in, the, instruction, of, pilots, and, senior, seafarers, from, 1527, onwards, by, royal, appointment, along, with, his, recognized, competence, as, mathematician, and, astronomer, the, main, problem, in, navigating, back, from, the, south, of, the, canary, islands, or, south, of, boujdour, by, sail, alone, is, due, to, the, change, in, the, regime, of, winds, and, currents, the, north, atlantic, gyre, and, the, equatorial, counter, current, will, push, south, along, the, northwest, bulge, of, africa, while, the, uncertain, winds, where, the, northeast, trades, meet, the, southeast, trades, the, doldrums, leave, a, sailing, ship, to, the, mercy, of, the, currents, together, prevalent, current, and, wind, make, northwards, progress, very, difficult, or, impossible, it, was, to, overcome, this, problem, and, clear, the, passage, to, india, around, africa, as, a, viable, maritime, trade, route, that, a, systematic, plan, of, exploration, was, devised, by, the, portuguese, the, return, route, from, regions, south, of, the, canaries, became, the, volta, do, largo, or, volta, do, mar, the, rediscovery, of, the, azores, islands, in, 1427, is, merely, a, reflection, of, the, heightened, strategic, importance, of, the, islands, now, sitting, on, the, return, route, from, the, western, coast, of, africa, sequentially, called, volta, de, guin, and, volta, da, mina, and, the, references, to, the, sargasso, sea, also, called, at, the, time, mar, da, baga, to, the, west, of, the, azores, in, 1436, reveals, the, western, extent, of, the, return, route, this, is, necessary, under, sail, to, make, use, of, the, southeasterly, and, northeasterly, winds, away, from, the, western, coast, of, africa, up, to, the, northern, latitudes, where, the, westerly, winds, will, bring, the, seafarers, towards, the, western, coasts, of, europe, the, secrecy, involving, the, portuguese, navigations, with, the, death, penalty, for, the, leaking, of, maps, and, routes, concentrated, all, sensitive, records, in, the, royal, archives, completely, destroyed, by, the, lisbon, earthquake, of, 1775, however, the, systematic, nature, of, the, portuguese, campaign, mapping, the, currents, and, winds, of, the, atlantic, is, demonstrated, by, the, understanding, of, the, seasonal, variations, with, expeditions, setting, sail, at, different, times, of, the, year, taking, different, routes, to, take, account, of, seasonal, predominate, winds, this, happens, from, as, early, as, late, 15th, century, and, early, 16th, bartolomeu, dias, followed, the, african, coast, on, his, way, south, in, august, 1487, while, vasco, da, gama, would, take, an, open, sea, route, from, the, latitude, of, sierra, leone, spending, three, months, in, the, open, sea, of, the, south, atlantic, to, profit, from, the, southwards, deflection, of, the, southwesterly, on, the, brazilian, side, and, the, brazilian, current, going, southward, gama, departed, in, july, 1497, and, pedro, lvares, cabral, departing, march, 1500, took, an, even, larger, arch, to, the, west, from, the, latitude, of, cape, verde, thus, avoiding, the, summer, monsoon, which, would, have, blocked, the, route, taken, by, gama, at, the, time, he, set, sail, furthermore, there, were, systematic, expeditions, pushing, into, the, western, northern, atlantic, teive, 1454, vogado, 1462, teles, 1474, ulmo, 1486, the, documents, relating, to, the, supplying, of, ships, and, the, ordering, of, sun, declination, tables, for, the, southern, atlantic, for, as, early, as, 1493, 1496, all, suggest, a, well, planned, and, systematic, activity, happening, during, the, decade, long, period, between, bartolomeu, dias, finding, the, southern, tip, of, africa, and, gama, s, departure, additionally, there, are, indications, of, further, travels, by, bartolomeu, dias, in, the, area, the, most, significant, consequence, of, this, systematic, knowledge, was, the, negotiation, of, the, treaty, of, tordesillas, in, 1494, moving, the, line, of, demarcation, 270, leagues, to, the, west, from, 100, to, 370, leagues, west, of, the, azores, bringing, what, is, now, brazil, into, the, portuguese, area, of, domination, the, knowledge, gathered, from, open, sea, exploration, allowed, for, the, well, documented, extended, periods, of, sail, without, sight, of, land, not, by, accident, but, as, pre, determined, planned, route, for, example, 30, days, for, bartolomeu, dias, culminating, on, mossel, bay, the, three, months, gama, spent, in, the, south, atlantic, to, use, the, brazil, current, southward, or, the, 29, days, cabral, took, from, cape, verde, up, to, landing, in, monte, pascoal, brazil, the, danish, expedition, to, arabia, 1761, 67, can, be, said, to, be, the, world, s, first, oceanographic, expedition, as, the, ship, gr, nland, had, on, board, a, group, of, scientists, including, naturalist, peter, forssk, l, who, was, assigned, an, explicit, task, by, the, king, frederik, v, to, study, and, describe, the, marine, life, in, the, open, sea, including, finding, the, cause, of, mareel, or, milky, seas, for, this, purpose, the, expedition, was, equipped, with, nets, and, scrapers, specifically, designed, to, collect, samples, from, the, open, waters, and, the, bottom, at, great, depth, although, juan, ponce, de, le, n, in, 1513, first, identified, the, gulf, stream, and, the, current, was, well, known, to, mariners, benjamin, franklin, made, the, first, scientific, study, of, it, and, gave, it, its, name, franklin, measured, water, temperatures, during, several, atlantic, crossings, and, correctly, explained, the, gulf, stream, s, cause, franklin, and, timothy, folger, printed, the, first, map, of, the, gulf, stream, in, 1769, 1770, information, on, the, currents, of, the, pacific, ocean, was, gathered, by, explorers, of, the, late, 18th, century, including, james, cook, and, louis, antoine, de, bougainville, james, rennell, wrote, the, first, scientific, textbooks, on, oceanography, detailing, the, current, flows, of, the, atlantic, and, indian, oceans, during, a, voyage, around, the, cape, of, good, hope, in, 1777, he, mapped, the, banks, and, currents, at, the, lagullas, he, was, also, the, first, to, understand, the, nature, of, the, intermittent, current, near, the, isles, of, scilly, now, known, as, rennell, s, current, the, tides, and, currents, of, the, ocean, are, distinct, tides, are, the, rise, and, fall, of, sea, levels, created, by, the, combination, of, the, gravitational, forces, of, the, moon, along, with, the, sun, the, sun, just, in, a, much, lesser, extent, and, are, also, caused, by, the, earth, and, moon, orbiting, each, other, an, ocean, current, is, a, continuous, directed, movement, of, seawater, generated, by, a, number, of, forces, acting, upon, the, water, including, wind, the, coriolis, effect, breaking, waves, cabbeling, and, temperature, and, salinity, differences, sir, james, clark, ross, took, the, first, modern, sounding, in, deep, sea, in, 1840, and, charles, darwin, published, a, paper, on, reefs, and, the, formation, of, atolls, as, a, result, of, the, second, voyage, of, hms, beagle, in, 1831, 1836, robert, fitzroy, published, a, four, volume, report, of, beagle, s, three, voyages, in, 1841, 1842, edward, forbes, undertook, dredging, in, the, aegean, sea, that, founded, marine, ecology, the, first, superintendent, of, the, united, states, naval, observatory, 1842, 1861, matthew, fontaine, maury, devoted, his, time, to, the, study, of, marine, meteorology, navigation, and, charting, prevailing, winds, and, currents, his, 1855, textbook, physical, geography, of, the, sea, was, one, of, the, first, comprehensive, oceanography, studies, many, nations, sent, oceanographic, observations, to, maury, at, the, naval, observatory, where, he, and, his, colleagues, evaluated, the, information, and, distributed, the, results, worldwide, knowledge, of, the, oceans, remained, confined, to, the, topmost, few, fathoms, of, the, water, and, a, small, amount, of, the, bottom, mainly, in, shallow, areas, almost, nothing, was, known, of, the, ocean, depths, the, british, royal, navy, s, efforts, to, chart, all, of, the, world, s, coastlines, in, the, mid, 19th, century, reinforced, the, vague, idea, that, most, of, the, ocean, was, very, deep, although, little, more, was, known, as, exploration, ignited, both, popular, and, scientific, interest, in, the, polar, regions, and, africa, so, too, did, the, mysteries, of, the, unexplored, oceans, the, seminal, event, in, the, founding, of, the, modern, science, of, oceanography, was, the, 1872, 1876, challenger, expedition, as, the, first, true, oceanographic, cruise, this, expedition, laid, the, groundwork, for, an, entire, academic, and, research, discipline, in, response, to, a, recommendation, from, the, royal, society, the, british, government, announced, in, 1871, an, expedition, to, explore, world, s, oceans, and, conduct, appropriate, scientific, investigation, charles, wyville, thomson, and, sir, john, murray, launched, the, challenger, expedition, challenger, leased, from, the, royal, navy, was, modified, for, scientific, work, and, equipped, with, separate, laboratories, for, natural, history, and, chemistry, under, the, scientific, supervision, of, thomson, challenger, travelled, nearly, 70, 000, nautical, miles, 130, 000, km, surveying, and, exploring, on, her, journey, circumnavigating, the, globe, 492, deep, sea, soundings, 133, bottom, dredges, 151, open, water, trawls, and, 263, serial, water, temperature, observations, were, taken, around, 4, 700, new, species, of, marine, life, were, discovered, the, result, was, the, report, of, the, scientific, results, of, the, exploring, voyage, of, h, m, s, challenger, during, the, years, 1873, 76, murray, who, supervised, the, publication, described, the, report, as, the, greatest, advance, in, the, knowledge, of, our, planet, since, the, celebrated, discoveries, of, the, fifteenth, and, sixteenth, centuries, he, went, on, to, found, the, academic, discipline, of, oceanography, at, the, university, of, edinburgh, which, remained, the, centre, for, oceanographic, research, well, into, the, 20th, century, murray, was, the, first, to, study, marine, trenches, and, in, particular, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, and, map, the, sedimentary, deposits, in, the, oceans, he, tried, to, map, out, the, world, s, ocean, currents, based, on, salinity, and, temperature, observations, and, was, the, first, to, correctly, understand, the, nature, of, coral, reef, development, in, the, late, 19th, century, other, western, nations, also, sent, out, scientific, expeditions, as, did, private, individuals, and, institutions, the, first, purpose, built, oceanographic, ship, albatros, was, built, in, 1882, in, 1893, fridtjof, nansen, allowed, his, ship, fram, to, be, frozen, in, the, arctic, ice, this, enabled, him, to, obtain, oceanographic, meteorological, and, astronomical, data, at, a, stationary, spot, over, an, extended, period, in, 1881, the, geographer, john, francon, williams, published, a, seminal, book, geography, of, the, oceans, between, 1907, and, 1911, otto, kr, mmel, published, the, handbuch, der, ozeanographie, which, became, influential, in, awakening, public, interest, in, oceanography, the, four, month, 1910, north, atlantic, expedition, headed, by, john, murray, and, johan, hjort, was, the, most, ambitious, research, oceanographic, and, marine, zoological, project, ever, mounted, until, then, and, led, to, the, classic, 1912, book, the, depths, of, the, ocean, the, first, acoustic, measurement, of, sea, depth, was, made, in, 1914, between, 1925, and, 1927, the, meteor, expedition, gathered, 70, 000, ocean, depth, measurements, using, an, echo, sounder, surveying, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, in, 1934, easter, ellen, cupp, the, first, woman, to, have, earned, a, phd, at, scripps, in, the, united, states, completed, a, major, work, on, diatoms, that, remained, the, standard, taxonomy, in, the, field, until, well, after, her, death, in, 1999, in, 1940, cupp, was, let, go, from, her, position, at, scripps, sverdrup, specifically, commended, cupp, as, a, conscientious, and, industrious, worker, and, commented, that, his, decision, was, no, reflection, on, her, ability, as, a, scientist, sverdrup, used, the, instructor, billet, vacated, by, cupp, to, employ, marston, sargent, a, biologist, studying, marine, algae, which, was, not, a, new, research, program, at, scripps, financial, pressures, did, not, prevent, sverdrup, from, retaining, the, services, of, two, other, young, post, doctoral, students, walter, munk, and, roger, revelle, cupp, s, partner, dorothy, rosenbury, found, her, a, position, teaching, high, school, where, she, remained, for, the, rest, of, her, career, russell, 2000, sverdrup, johnson, and, fleming, published, the, oceans, in, 1942, which, was, a, major, landmark, the, sea, in, three, volumes, covering, physical, oceanography, seawater, and, geology, edited, by, m, n, hill, was, published, in, 1962, while, rhodes, fairbridge, s, encyclopedia, of, oceanography, was, published, in, 1966, the, great, global, rift, running, along, the, mid, atlantic, ridge, was, discovered, by, maurice, ewing, and, bruce, heezen, in, 1953, and, mapped, by, heezen, and, marie, tharp, using, bathymetric, data, in, 1954, a, mountain, range, under, the, arctic, ocean, was, found, by, the, arctic, institute, of, the, ussr, the, theory, of, seafloor, spreading, was, developed, in, 1960, by, harry, hammond, hess, the, ocean, drilling, program, started, in, 1966, deep, sea, vents, were, discovered, in, 1977, by, jack, corliss, and, robert, ballard, in, the, submersible, dsv, alvin, in, the, 1950s, auguste, piccard, invented, the, bathyscaphe, and, used, the, bathyscaphe, trieste, to, investigate, the, ocean, s, depths, the, united, states, nuclear, submarine, nautilus, made, the, first, journey, under, the, ice, to, the, north, pole, in, 1958, in, 1962, the, flip, floating, instrument, platform, a, 355, foot, 108, m, spar, buoy, was, first, deployed, in, 1968, tanya, atwater, led, the, first, all, woman, oceanographic, expedition, until, that, time, gender, policies, restricted, women, oceanographers, from, participating, in, voyages, to, a, significant, extent, from, the, 1970s, there, has, been, much, emphasis, on, the, application, of, large, scale, computers, to, oceanography, to, allow, numerical, predictions, of, ocean, conditions, and, as, a, part, of, overall, environmental, change, prediction, early, techniques, included, analog, computers, such, as, the, ishiguro, storm, surge, computer, generally, now, replaced, by, numerical, methods, e, g, slosh, an, oceanographic, buoy, array, was, established, in, the, pacific, to, allow, prediction, of, el, ni, o, events, 1990, saw, the, start, of, the, world, ocean, circulation, experiment, woce, which, continued, until, 2002, geosat, seafloor, mapping, data, became, available, in, 1995, study, of, the, oceans, is, critical, to, understanding, shifts, in, earth, s, energy, balance, along, with, related, global, and, regional, changes, in, climate, the, biosphere, and, biogeochemistry, the, atmosphere, and, ocean, are, linked, because, of, evaporation, and, precipitation, as, well, as, thermal, flux, and, solar, insolation, recent, studies, have, advanced, knowledge, on, ocean, acidification, ocean, heat, content, ocean, currents, sea, level, rise, the, oceanic, carbon, cycle, the, water, cycle, arctic, sea, ice, decline, coral, bleaching, marine, heatwaves, extreme, weather, coastal, erosion, and, many, other, phenomena, in, regards, to, ongoing, climate, change, and, climate, feedbacks, in, general, understanding, the, world, ocean, through, further, scientific, study, enables, better, stewardship, and, sustainable, utilization, of, earth, s, resources, the, intergovernmental, oceanographic, commission, reports, that, 1, 7, of, the, total, national, research, expenditure, of, its, members, is, focused, on, ocean, science, the, study, of, oceanography, is, divided, into, these, five, branches, biological, oceanography, investigates, the, ecology, and, biology, of, marine, organisms, in, the, context, of, the, physical, chemical, and, geological, characteristics, of, their, ocean, environment, chemical, oceanography, is, the, study, of, the, chemistry, of, the, ocean, whereas, chemical, oceanography, is, primarily, occupied, with, the, study, and, understanding, of, seawater, properties, and, its, changes, ocean, chemistry, focuses, primarily, on, the, geochemical, cycles, the, following, is, a, central, topic, investigated, by, chemical, oceanography, ocean, acidification, describes, the, decrease, in, ocean, ph, that, is, caused, by, anthropogenic, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, emissions, into, the, atmosphere, seawater, is, slightly, alkaline, and, had, a, preindustrial, ph, of, about, 8, 2, more, recently, anthropogenic, activities, have, steadily, increased, the, carbon, dioxide, content, of, the, atmosphere, about, 30, 40, of, the, added, co, 2, is, absorbed, by, the, oceans, forming, carbonic, acid, and, lowering, the, ph, now, below, 8, 1, through, ocean, acidification, the, ph, is, expected, to, reach, 7, 7, by, the, year, 2100, an, important, element, for, the, skeletons, of, marine, animals, is, calcium, but, calcium, carbonate, becomes, more, soluble, with, pressure, so, carbonate, shells, and, skeletons, dissolve, below, the, carbonate, compensation, depth, calcium, carbonate, becomes, more, soluble, at, lower, ph, so, ocean, acidification, is, likely, to, affect, marine, organisms, with, calcareous, shells, such, as, oysters, clams, sea, urchins, and, corals, and, the, carbonate, compensation, depth, will, rise, closer, to, the, sea, surface, affected, planktonic, organisms, will, include, pteropods, coccolithophorids, and, foraminifera, all, important, in, the, food, chain, in, tropical, regions, corals, are, likely, to, be, severely, affected, as, they, become, less, able, to, build, their, calcium, carbonate, skeletons, in, turn, adversely, impacting, other, reef, dwellers, the, current, rate, of, ocean, chemistry, change, seems, to, be, unprecedented, in, earth, s, geological, history, making, it, unclear, how, well, marine, ecosystems, will, adapt, to, the, shifting, conditions, of, the, near, future, of, particular, concern, is, the, manner, in, which, the, combination, of, acidification, with, the, expected, additional, stressors, of, higher, ocean, temperatures, and, lower, oxygen, levels, will, impact, the, seas, geological, oceanography, is, the, study, of, the, geology, of, the, ocean, floor, including, plate, tectonics, and, paleoceanography, physical, oceanography, studies, the, ocean, s, physical, attributes, including, temperature, salinity, structure, mixing, surface, waves, internal, waves, surface, tides, internal, tides, and, currents, the, following, are, central, topics, investigated, by, physical, oceanography, since, the, early, ocean, expeditions, in, oceanography, a, major, interest, was, the, study, of, ocean, currents, and, temperature, measurements, the, tides, the, coriolis, effect, changes, in, direction, and, strength, of, wind, salinity, and, temperature, are, the, main, factors, determining, ocean, currents, the, thermohaline, circulation, thc, thermo, referring, to, temperature, and, haline, referring, to, salt, content, connects, the, ocean, basins, and, is, primarily, dependent, on, the, density, of, sea, water, it, is, becoming, more, common, to, refer, to, this, system, as, the, meridional, overturning, circulation, because, it, more, accurately, accounts, for, other, driving, factors, beyond, temperature, and, salinity, oceanic, heat, content, ohc, refers, to, the, extra, heat, stored, in, the, ocean, from, changes, in, earth, s, energy, balance, the, increase, in, the, ocean, heat, play, an, important, role, in, sea, level, rise, because, of, thermal, expansion, ocean, warming, accounts, for, 90, of, the, energy, accumulation, associated, with, global, warming, since, 1971, paleoceanography, is, the, study, of, the, history, of, the, oceans, in, the, geologic, past, with, regard, to, circulation, chemistry, biology, geology, and, patterns, of, sedimentation, and, biological, productivity, paleoceanographic, studies, using, environment, models, and, different, proxies, enable, the, scientific, community, to, assess, the, role, of, the, oceanic, processes, in, the, global, climate, by, the, reconstruction, of, past, climate, at, various, intervals, paleoceanographic, research, is, also, intimately, tied, to, palaeoclimatology, the, earliest, international, organizations, of, oceanography, were, founded, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, starting, with, the, international, council, for, the, exploration, of, the, sea, created, in, 1902, followed, in, 1919, by, the, mediterranean, science, commission, marine, research, institutes, were, already, in, existence, starting, with, the, stazione, zoologica, anton, dohrn, in, naples, italy, 1872, the, biological, station, of, roscoff, france, 1876, the, arago, laboratory, in, banyuls, sur, mer, france, 1882, the, laboratory, of, the, marine, biological, association, in, plymouth, uk, 1884, the, norwegian, institute, for, marine, research, in, bergen, norway, 1900, the, laboratory, f, r, internationale, meeresforschung, kiel, germany, 1902, on, the, other, side, of, the, atlantic, the, scripps, institution, of, oceanography, was, founded, in, 1903, followed, by, the, woods, hole, oceanographic, institution, in, 1930, the, virginia, institute, of, marine, science, in, 1938, the, lamont, doherty, earth, observatory, at, columbia, university, in, 1949, and, later, the, school, of, oceanography, at, university, of, washington, in, australia, the, australian, institute, of, marine, science, aims, established, in, 1972, soon, became, a, key, player, in, marine, tropical, research, in, 1921, the, international, hydrographic, bureau, called, since, 1970, the, international, hydrographic, organization, was, established, to, develop, hydrographic, and, nautical, charting, standards
