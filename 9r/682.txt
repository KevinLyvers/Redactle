the, phanerozoic, is, the, current, and, the, latest, of, the, four, geologic, eons, in, the, earth, s, geologic, time, scale, covering, the, time, period, from, 538, 8, million, years, ago, to, the, present, it, is, the, eon, during, which, abundant, animal, and, plant, life, has, proliferated, diversified, and, colonized, various, niches, on, the, earth, s, surface, beginning, with, the, cambrian, period, when, animals, first, developed, hard, shells, that, can, be, clearly, preserved, in, the, fossil, record, the, time, before, the, phanerozoic, collectively, called, the, precambrian, is, now, divided, into, the, hadean, archaean, and, proterozoic, eons, the, time, span, of, the, phanerozoic, starts, with, the, sudden, appearance, of, fossilised, evidence, of, a, number, of, animal, phyla, the, evolution, of, those, phyla, into, diverse, forms, the, evolution, of, plants, the, evolution, of, fish, arthropods, and, molluscs, the, terrestrial, colonization, and, evolution, of, insects, chelicerates, myriapods, and, tetrapods, and, the, development, of, modern, fauna, dominated, by, vascular, plants, during, this, time, span, tectonic, forces, which, move, the, continents, had, collected, them, into, a, single, landmass, known, as, pangaea, the, most, recent, supercontinent, which, then, separated, into, the, current, continental, landmasses, the, term, phanerozoic, was, coined, in, 1930, by, the, american, geologist, george, halcott, chadwick, 1876, 1953, deriving, from, the, ancient, greek, words, phaner, s, meaning, visible, and, z, meaning, life, this, is, because, it, was, once, believed, that, life, began, in, the, cambrian, the, first, period, of, this, eon, due, to, the, lack, of, precambrian, fossil, record, back, then, however, trace, fossils, of, booming, complex, life, from, the, ediacaran, period, avalon, explosion, of, the, preceding, proterozoic, eon, have, since, been, discovered, and, the, modern, scientific, consensus, now, agrees, that, complex, life, in, the, form, of, placozoans, and, primitive, sponges, such, as, otavia, has, existed, at, least, since, the, tonian, period, and, the, earliest, known, life, forms, in, the, form, of, simple, prokaryotic, microbial, mats, started, in, the, ocean, floor, during, the, earlier, archean, eon, the, proterozoic, phanerozoic, boundary, is, at, 538, 8, million, years, ago, in, the, 19th, century, the, boundary, was, set, at, time, of, appearance, of, the, first, abundant, animal, metazoan, fossils, but, trace, fossils, of, several, hundred, groups, taxa, of, complex, soft, bodied, metazoa, from, the, preceding, ediacaran, period, of, the, proterozoic, eon, known, as, the, avalon, explosion, have, been, identified, since, the, systematic, study, of, those, forms, started, in, the, 1950s, the, transition, from, the, largely, sessile, precambrian, biota, to, the, active, mobile, cambrian, biota, occurred, early, in, the, phanerozoic, the, phanerozoic, is, divided, into, three, eras, the, paleozoic, mesozoic, and, cenozoic, which, are, further, subdivided, into, 12, periods, the, paleozoic, features, the, evolution, of, the, three, most, prominent, animal, phyla, arthropods, molluscs, and, chordates, the, last, of, which, includes, fish, amphibians, and, the, fully, terrestrial, amniotes, synapsids, and, sauropsids, the, mesozoic, features, the, evolution, of, crocodilians, turtles, dinosaurs, including, birds, lepidosaurs, lizards, and, snakes, and, mammals, the, cenozoic, begins, with, the, extinction, of, all, non, avian, dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and, marine, reptiles, and, features, the, great, diversification, in, birds, and, mammals, humans, appeared, and, evolved, during, the, most, recent, part, of, the, cenozoic, the, paleozoic, is, a, time, in, earth, s, history, when, active, complex, life, forms, evolved, took, their, first, foothold, on, dry, land, and, when, the, forerunners, of, all, multicellular, life, on, earth, began, to, diversify, there, are, six, periods, in, the, paleozoic, era, cambrian, ordovician, silurian, devonian, carboniferous, and, permian, the, cambrian, is, the, first, period, of, the, paleozoic, era, and, ran, from, 539, million, to, 485, million, years, ago, the, cambrian, sparked, a, rapid, expansion, in, the, diversity, of, animals, in, an, event, known, as, the, cambrian, explosion, during, which, the, greatest, number, of, animal, body, plans, evolved, in, a, single, period, in, the, history, of, earth, complex, algae, evolved, and, the, fauna, was, dominated, by, armoured, arthropods, such, as, trilobites, and, radiodontids, and, to, a, lesser, extent, shelled, cephalopods, such, as, orthocones, almost, all, phyla, of, marine, animals, evolved, in, this, period, during, this, time, the, super, continent, pannotia, began, to, break, up, most, of, which, later, recombined, into, the, super, continent, gondwana, the, ordovician, spans, from, 485, million, to, 444, million, years, ago, the, ordovician, was, a, time, in, earth, s, history, in, which, many, groups, still, prevalent, today, evolved, or, diversified, such, as, primitive, nautiloids, vertebrates, then, only, jawless, fish, and, corals, this, process, is, known, as, the, great, ordovician, biodiversification, event, or, gobe, trilobites, began, to, be, replaced, by, articulate, brachiopods, and, crinoids, also, became, an, increasingly, important, part, of, the, fauna, the, first, arthropods, crept, ashore, to, colonise, gondwana, a, continent, empty, of, animal, life, a, group, of, freshwater, green, algae, the, streptophytes, also, survived, being, washed, ashore, and, began, to, colonize, the, flood, plains, and, riparian, zones, giving, rise, to, primitive, land, plants, by, the, end, of, the, ordovician, gondwana, had, moved, from, the, equator, to, the, south, pole, and, laurentia, had, collided, with, baltica, closing, the, iapetus, ocean, the, glaciation, of, gondwana, resulted, in, a, major, drop, in, sea, level, killing, off, all, life, that, had, established, along, its, coast, glaciation, caused, an, icehouse, earth, leading, to, the, ordovician, silurian, extinction, during, which, 60, of, marine, invertebrates, and, 25, of, families, became, extinct, though, one, of, the, deadliest, mass, extinctions, in, earth, s, history, the, o, s, extinction, did, not, cause, profound, ecological, changes, between, the, periods, the, silurian, spans, from, 444, million, to, 419, million, years, ago, which, saw, a, warming, from, an, icehouse, earth, this, period, saw, the, mass, diversification, of, fish, as, jawless, fish, became, more, numerous, and, early, jawed, fish, and, freshwater, species, appeared, in, the, fossil, record, arthropods, remained, abundant, and, some, groups, such, as, eurypterids, became, apex, predators, in, the, ocean, fully, terrestrial, life, established, itself, on, land, including, early, fungi, arachnids, hexapods, and, myriapods, the, evolution, of, vascular, plants, mainly, spore, producing, ferns, such, as, cooksonia, allowed, land, plants, to, gain, a, foothold, further, inland, as, well, during, this, time, there, were, four, continents, gondwana, africa, south, america, australia, antarctica, india, laurentia, north, america, with, parts, of, europe, baltica, the, rest, of, europe, and, siberia, northern, asia, the, devonian, spans, from, 419, million, to, 359, million, years, ago, also, informally, known, as, the, age, of, the, fish, the, devonian, features, a, huge, diversification, in, fish, such, as, the, jawless, conodonts, and, ostracoderms, as, well, as, jawed, fish, such, as, the, armored, placoderms, e, g, dunkleosteus, the, spiny, acanthodians, and, early, bony, fish, the, devonian, also, saw, the, primitive, appearance, of, modern, fish, groups, such, as, chondricthyans, cartilaginous, fish, and, osteichthyans, bony, fish, the, latter, of, which, include, two, clades, the, actinopterygians, ray, finned, fish, and, sarcopterygians, lobe, finned, fish, one, lineage, of, sarcopterygians, rhipidistia, evolved, the, first, four, limbed, vertebrates, which, would, eventually, become, tetrapods, on, land, plant, groups, diversified, after, the, silurian, devonian, terrestrial, revolution, the, first, woody, ferns, and, the, earliest, seed, plants, evolved, during, this, period, by, the, middle, devonian, shrub, like, forests, existed, lycophytes, horsetails, and, progymnosperm, this, greening, event, also, allowed, the, diversification, of, arthropods, as, they, took, advantage, of, the, new, habitat, near, the, end, of, the, devonian, 70, of, all, species, became, extinct, in, a, sequence, of, mass, extinction, events, collectively, known, as, the, late, devonian, extinction, the, carboniferous, spans, from, 359, million, to, 299, million, years, ago, tropical, swamps, dominated, the, earth, and, the, large, amounts, of, trees, sequestered, much, of, the, carbon, that, became, coal, deposits, hence, the, name, carboniferous, and, the, term, coal, forest, about, 90, of, all, coal, beds, were, deposited, in, the, carboniferous, and, permian, periods, which, represent, just, 2, of, the, earth, s, geologic, history, the, high, oxygen, levels, caused, by, these, wetland, rainforests, allowed, arthropods, normally, limited, in, size, by, their, respiratory, systems, to, proliferate, and, increase, in, size, tetrapods, also, diversified, during, the, carboniferous, as, semiaquatic, amphibians, such, as, the, temnospondyls, and, one, lineage, developed, extraembryonic, membranes, that, allowed, their, eggs, to, survive, outside, of, the, water, these, tetrapods, the, amniotes, included, the, first, sauropsids, which, evolved, the, reptiles, dinosaurs, and, birds, and, synapsids, the, ancestors, of, mammal, throughout, the, carboniferous, there, was, a, cooling, pattern, which, eventually, led, to, the, glaciation, of, gondwana, as, much, of, it, was, situated, around, the, south, pole, this, event, was, known, as, the, permo, carboniferous, glaciation, and, resulted, in, a, major, loss, of, coal, forests, known, as, the, carboniferous, rainforest, collapse, the, permian, spans, from, 299, million, to, 251, million, years, ago, and, was, the, last, period, of, the, paleozoic, era, at, its, beginning, all, landmasses, came, together, to, form, the, supercontinent, pangaea, surrounded, by, one, expansive, ocean, called, panthalassa, the, earth, was, relatively, dry, compared, to, the, carboniferous, with, harsh, seasons, as, the, climate, of, the, interior, of, pangaea, was, not, moderated, by, large, bodies, of, water, amniotes, still, flourished, and, diversified, in, the, new, dry, climate, particularly, synapsids, such, as, dimetrodon, edaphosaurus, and, therapsids, which, gave, rise, to, the, ancestors, of, modern, mammals, the, first, conifers, evolved, during, this, period, then, dominated, the, terrestrial, landscape, the, permian, ended, with, at, least, one, mass, extinction, an, event, sometimes, known, as, the, great, dying, caused, by, large, floods, of, lava, the, siberian, traps, in, russia, and, the, emeishan, traps, in, china, this, extinction, was, the, largest, in, earth, s, history, and, led, to, the, loss, of, 95, of, all, species, of, life, the, mesozoic, ranges, from, 252, million, to, 66, million, years, ago, also, referred, to, as, the, age, of, reptiles, age, of, dinosaurs, or, age, of, conifers, the, mesozoic, featured, the, first, time, the, sauropsids, ascended, to, ecological, dominance, over, the, synapsids, as, well, as, the, diversification, of, many, modern, ray, finned, fish, insects, molluscs, particularly, the, coleoids, tetrapods, and, plants, the, mesozoic, is, subdivided, into, three, periods, the, triassic, jurassic, and, cretaceous, the, triassic, ranges, from, 252, million, to, 201, million, years, ago, the, triassic, is, mostly, a, transitional, recovery, period, between, the, desolate, aftermath, of, the, permian, extinction, and, the, lush, jurassic, period, it, has, three, major, epochs, early, triassic, middle, triassic, and, late, triassic, the, early, triassic, lasted, between, 252, million, to, 247, million, years, ago, and, was, a, hot, and, arid, epoch, in, the, aftermath, of, the, permian, extinction, many, tetrapods, during, this, epoch, represented, a, disaster, fauna, a, group, of, survivor, animals, with, low, diversity, and, cosmopolitanism, wide, geographic, ranges, temnospondyli, recovered, first, and, evolved, into, large, aquatic, predators, during, the, triassic, other, reptiles, also, diversified, rapidly, with, aquatic, reptiles, such, as, ichthyosaurs, and, sauropterygians, proliferating, in, the, seas, on, land, the, first, true, archosaurs, appeared, including, pseudosuchians, crocodile, relatives, and, avemetatarsalians, bird, dinosaur, relatives, the, middle, triassic, spans, from, 247, million, to, 237, million, years, ago, the, middle, triassic, featured, the, beginnings, of, the, break, up, of, pangaea, as, rifting, commenced, in, north, pangaea, the, northern, part, of, the, tethys, ocean, the, paleotethys, ocean, had, become, a, passive, basin, but, a, spreading, center, was, active, in, the, southern, part, of, the, tethys, ocean, the, neotethys, ocean, phytoplankton, coral, crustaceans, and, many, other, marine, invertebrates, recovered, from, the, permian, extinction, by, the, end, of, the, middle, triassic, meanwhile, on, land, reptiles, continued, to, diversify, conifer, forests, flourished, as, well, as, the, first, flies, the, late, triassic, spans, from, 237, million, to, 201, million, years, ago, following, the, bloom, of, the, middle, triassic, the, late, triassic, was, initially, warm, and, arid, with, a, strong, monsoon, climate, and, with, most, precipitation, limited, to, coastal, regions, and, high, latitudes, this, changed, late, in, the, carnian, period, with, a, 2, million, years, long, wet, season, which, transformed, the, arid, continental, interior, into, lush, alluvial, forests, the, first, true, dinosaurs, appeared, early, in, the, late, triassic, and, pterosaurs, evolved, a, bit, later, other, large, reptilian, competitors, to, the, dinosaurs, were, wiped, out, by, the, triassic, jurassic, extinction, event, in, which, most, archosaurs, excluding, crocodylomorphs, pterosaurs, and, dinosaurs, most, therapsids, except, cynodonts, and, almost, all, large, amphibians, became, extinct, as, well, as, 34, of, marine, life, in, the, fourth, mass, extinction, event, the, cause, of, the, extinction, is, debated, but, likely, resulted, from, eruptions, of, the, camp, large, igneous, province, the, jurassic, ranges, from, 201, million, to, 145, million, years, ago, and, features, three, major, epochs, early, jurassic, middle, jurassic, and, late, jurassic, the, early, jurassic, epoch, spans, from, 201, million, to, 174, million, years, ago, the, climate, was, much, more, humid, than, during, the, triassic, and, as, a, result, the, world, was, warm, and, partially, tropical, though, possibly, with, short, colder, intervals, plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs, and, ammonites, dominated, the, seas, while, dinosaurs, pterysaurs, and, other, reptiles, dominated, the, land, with, species, such, as, dilophosaurus, at, the, apex, crocodylomorphs, evolved, into, aquatic, forms, pushing, the, remaining, large, amphibians, to, near, extinction, true, mammals, were, present, during, the, jurassic, but, remained, small, with, average, body, masses, of, less, than, 10, kilograms, 22, lb, until, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, the, middle, and, late, jurassic, epochs, span, from, 174, million, to, 145, million, years, ago, conifer, savannahs, made, up, a, large, portion, of, the, world, s, forests, in, the, oceans, plesiosaurs, were, quite, common, and, ichthyosaurs, were, flourishing, the, late, jurassic, epoch, spans, from, 163, million, to, 145, million, years, ago, the, late, jurassic, featured, a, severe, extinction, of, sauropods, in, northern, continents, alongside, many, ichthyosaurs, however, the, jurassic, cretaceous, boundary, did, not, strongly, impact, most, forms, of, life, the, cretaceous, is, the, phanerozoic, s, longest, period, and, the, last, period, of, the, mesozoic, it, spans, from, 145, million, to, 66, million, years, ago, and, is, divided, into, two, epochs, early, cretaceous, and, late, cretaceous, the, early, cretaceous, epoch, spans, from, 145, million, to, 100, million, years, ago, dinosaurs, continued, to, be, abundant, with, groups, such, as, tyrannosauroids, avialans, birds, marginocephalians, and, ornithopods, seeing, early, glimpses, of, later, success, other, tetrapods, such, as, stegosaurs, and, ichthyosaurs, declined, significantly, and, sauropods, were, restricted, to, southern, continents, the, late, cretaceous, epoch, spans, from, 100, million, to, 66, million, years, ago, the, late, cretaceous, featured, a, cooling, trend, that, would, continue, into, the, cenozoic, era, eventually, the, tropical, climate, was, restricted, to, the, equator, and, areas, beyond, the, tropic, lines, featured, more, seasonal, climates, dinosaurs, still, thrived, as, new, species, such, as, tyrannosaurus, ankylosaurus, triceratops, and, hadrosaurs, dominated, the, food, web, whether, or, not, pterosaurs, went, into, a, decline, as, birds, radiated, is, debated, however, many, families, survived, until, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, alongside, new, forms, such, as, the, gigantic, quetzalcoatlus, mammals, diversified, despite, their, small, sizes, with, metatherians, marsupials, and, kin, and, eutherians, placentals, and, kin, coming, into, their, own, in, the, oceans, mosasaurs, diversified, to, fill, the, role, of, the, now, extinct, ichthyosaurs, alongside, huge, plesiosaurs, such, as, elasmosaurus, also, the, first, flowering, plants, evolved, at, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, the, deccan, traps, and, other, volcanic, eruptions, were, poisoning, the, atmosphere, as, this, was, continued, it, is, thought, that, a, large, meteor, smashed, into, earth, creating, the, chicxulub, crater, and, causing, the, event, known, as, the, k, pg, extinction, the, fifth, and, most, recent, mass, extinction, event, during, which, 75, of, life, on, earth, became, extinct, including, all, non, avian, dinosaurs, every, living, thing, with, a, body, mass, over, 10, kilograms, became, extinct, and, the, age, of, dinosaurs, came, to, an, end, the, cenozoic, featured, the, rise, of, mammals, and, birds, as, the, dominant, class, of, animals, as, the, end, of, the, age, of, dinosaurs, left, significant, open, niches, there, are, three, divisions, of, the, cenozoic, paleogene, neogene, and, quaternary, the, paleogene, spans, from, the, extinction, of, the, non, avian, dinosaurs, some, 66, million, years, ago, to, the, dawn, of, the, neogene, 23, million, years, ago, it, features, three, epochs, paleocene, eocene, and, oligocene, the, paleocene, epoch, began, with, the, k, pg, extinction, event, and, the, early, part, of, the, paleocene, saw, the, recovery, of, the, earth, from, that, event, the, continents, began, to, take, their, modern, shapes, but, most, continents, and, india, remained, separated, from, each, other, africa, and, eurasia, were, separated, by, the, tethys, sea, and, the, americas, were, separated, by, the, panamanic, seaway, as, the, isthmus, of, panama, had, not, yet, formed, this, epoch, featured, a, general, warming, trend, that, peaked, at, the, paleocene, eocene, thermal, maximum, and, the, earliest, modern, jungles, expanded, eventually, reaching, the, poles, the, oceans, were, dominated, by, sharks, as, the, large, reptiles, that, had, once, ruled, had, become, extinct, mammals, diversified, rapidly, but, most, remained, small, the, largest, tetrapod, carnivores, during, the, paleocene, were, reptiles, including, crocodyliforms, choristoderans, and, snakes, titanoboa, the, largest, known, snake, lived, in, south, america, during, the, paleocene, the, eocene, epoch, ranged, from, 56, million, to, 34, million, years, ago, in, the, early, eocene, most, land, mammals, were, small, and, living, in, cramped, jungles, much, like, the, paleocene, among, them, were, early, primates, whales, and, horses, along, with, many, other, early, forms, of, mammals, the, climate, was, warm, and, humid, with, little, temperature, gradient, from, pole, to, pole, in, the, middle, eocene, epoch, the, antarctic, circumpolar, current, formed, when, south, america, and, australia, both, separated, from, antarctica, to, open, up, the, drake, passage, and, tasmanian, passage, disrupting, ocean, currents, worldwide, resulting, in, global, cooling, and, causing, the, jungles, to, shrink, more, modern, forms, of, mammals, continued, to, diversify, with, the, cooling, climate, even, as, more, archaic, forms, died, out, by, the, end, of, the, eocene, whales, such, as, basilosaurus, had, become, fully, aquatic, the, late, eocene, epoch, saw, the, rebirth, of, seasons, which, caused, the, expansion, of, savanna, like, areas, with, the, earliest, substantial, grasslands, at, the, transition, between, the, eocene, and, oligocene, epochs, there, was, a, significant, extinction, event, the, cause, of, which, is, debated, the, oligocene, epoch, spans, from, 34, million, to, 23, million, years, ago, the, oligocene, was, an, important, transitional, period, between, the, tropical, world, of, the, eocene, and, more, modern, ecosystems, this, period, featured, a, global, expansion, of, grass, which, led, to, many, new, species, taking, advantage, including, the, first, elephants, felines, canines, marsupials, and, many, other, species, still, prevalent, today, many, other, species, of, plants, evolved, during, this, epoch, also, such, as, the, evergreen, trees, the, long, term, cooling, continued, and, seasonal, rain, patterns, established, mammals, continued, to, grow, larger, paraceratherium, one, of, the, largest, land, mammals, to, ever, live, evolved, during, this, epoch, along, with, many, other, perissodactyls, the, neogene, spans, from, 23, 03, million, to, 2, 58, million, years, ago, it, features, two, epochs, the, miocene, and, the, pliocene, the, miocene, spans, from, 23, 03, million, to, 5, 333, million, years, ago, and, is, a, period, in, which, grass, spread, further, across, effectively, dominating, a, large, portion, of, the, world, diminishing, forests, in, the, process, kelp, forests, evolved, leading, to, the, evolution, of, new, species, such, as, sea, otters, during, this, time, perissodactyls, thrived, and, evolved, into, many, different, varieties, alongside, them, were, the, apes, which, evolved, into, 30, species, overall, arid, and, mountainous, land, dominated, most, of, the, world, as, did, grazers, the, tethys, sea, finally, closed, with, the, creation, of, the, arabian, peninsula, and, in, its, wake, left, the, black, red, mediterranean, and, caspian, seas, this, only, increased, aridity, many, new, plants, evolved, and, 95, of, modern, seed, plants, evolved, in, the, mid, miocene, the, pliocene, lasted, from, 5, 333, million, to, 2, 58, million, years, ago, the, pliocene, featured, dramatic, climatic, changes, which, ultimately, led, to, modern, species, and, plants, the, mediterranean, sea, dried, up, for, hundreds, of, thousand, years, in, the, messinian, salinity, crisis, along, with, these, major, geological, events, africa, saw, the, appearance, of, australopithecus, the, ancestor, of, homo, the, isthmus, of, panama, formed, and, animals, migrated, between, north, and, south, america, wreaking, havoc, on, the, local, ecology, climatic, changes, brought, savannas, that, are, still, continuing, to, spread, across, the, world, indian, monsoons, deserts, in, east, asia, and, the, beginnings, of, the, sahara, desert, the, earth, s, continents, and, seas, moved, into, their, present, shapes, the, world, map, has, not, changed, much, since, save, for, changes, brought, about, by, the, quaternary, glaciation, such, as, lake, agassiz, precursor, of, the, great, lakes, the, quaternary, spans, from, 2, 58, million, years, ago, to, present, day, and, is, the, shortest, geological, period, in, the, phanerozoic, eon, it, features, modern, animals, and, dramatic, changes, in, the, climate, it, is, divided, into, two, epochs, the, pleistocene, and, the, holocene, the, pleistocene, lasted, from, 2, 58, million, to, 11, 700, years, ago, this, epoch, was, marked, by, a, series, of, glacial, periods, ice, ages, as, a, result, of, the, cooling, trend, that, started, in, the, mid, eocene, there, were, numerous, separate, glaciation, periods, marked, by, the, advance, of, ice, caps, as, far, south, as, 40, degrees, n, latitude, in, mountainous, areas, meanwhile, africa, experienced, a, trend, of, desiccation, which, resulted, in, the, creation, of, the, sahara, namib, and, kalahari, deserts, mammoths, giant, ground, sloths, dire, wolves, sabre, toothed, cats, and, archaic, humans, such, as, homo, erectus, were, common, and, widespread, during, the, pleistocene, a, more, anatomically, modern, human, homo, sapiens, began, migrating, out, of, east, africa, in, at, least, two, waves, the, first, being, as, early, as, 270, 000, years, ago, after, a, supervolcano, eruption, in, sumatra, 74, 000, years, ago, caused, a, global, population, bottleneck, of, humans, a, second, wave, of, homo, sapiens, migration, successfully, repopulated, every, continents, except, antarctica, as, the, pleistocene, drew, to, a, close, a, major, extinction, wiped, out, much, of, the, world, s, megafauna, including, non, homo, sapiens, human, species, such, as, homo, neanderthalensis, and, homo, floresiensis, all, the, continents, were, affected, but, africa, was, impacted, to, a, lesser, extent, and, retained, many, large, animals, such, as, elephants, rhinoceros, and, hippopotamus, the, extent, to, which, homo, sapiens, were, involved, in, this, megafaunal, extinction, is, debated, the, holocene, began, 11, 700, years, ago, at, the, end, of, younger, dryas, and, lasts, until, the, present, day, all, recorded, history, and, so, called, human, history, lies, within, the, boundaries, of, the, holocene, epoch, human, activity, is, blamed, for, an, ongoing, mass, extinction, that, began, roughly, 10, 000, years, ago, though, the, species, becoming, extinct, have, only, been, recorded, since, the, industrial, revolution, this, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, sixth, extinction, with, hundreds, of, species, gone, extinct, due, to, human, activities, such, as, overhunting, habitat, destruction, and, introduction, of, invasive, species, it, has, been, demonstrated, that, changes, in, biodiversity, through, the, phanerozoic, correlate, much, better, with, the, hyperbolic, model, widely, used, in, demography, and, macrosociology, than, with, exponential, and, logistic, models, traditionally, used, in, population, biology, and, extensively, applied, to, fossil, biodiversity, as, well, the, latter, models, imply, that, changes, in, diversity, are, guided, by, a, first, order, positive, feedback, more, ancestors, more, descendants, or, a, negative, feedback, that, arises, from, resource, limitation, or, both, the, hyperbolic, model, implies, a, second, order, positive, feedback, the, hyperbolic, pattern, of, the, human, population, growth, arises, from, quadratic, positive, feedback, caused, by, the, interaction, of, the, population, size, and, the, rate, of, technological, growth, the, character, of, biodiversity, growth, in, the, phanerozoic, eon, can, be, similarly, accounted, for, by, a, feedback, between, the, diversity, and, community, structure, complexity, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, similarity, between, the, curves, of, biodiversity, and, human, population, probably, comes, from, the, fact, that, both, are, derived, from, the, superposition, on, the, hyperbolic, trend, of, cyclical, and, random, dynamics, across, the, phanerozoic, the, dominant, driver, of, long, term, climatic, change, was, the, concentration, of, carbon, dioxide, in, the, atmosphere, though, some, studies, have, suggested, a, decoupling, of, carbon, dioxide, and, palaeotemperature, particularly, during, cold, intervals, of, the, phanerozoic, phanerozoic, carbon, dioxide, concentrations, have, been, governed, partially, by, a, 26, million, year, oceanic, crustal, cycle, since, the, devonian, large, swings, in, carbon, dioxide, of, 2, 000, ppm, or, more, were, uncommon, over, short, timescales, variations, in, global, temperature, were, limited, by, negative, feedbacks, in, the, phosphorus, cycle, wherein, increased, phosphorus, input, into, the, ocean, would, increase, surficial, biological, productivity, that, would, in, turn, enhance, iron, redox, cycling, and, thus, remove, phosphorus, from, seawater, this, maintained, a, relatively, stable, rate, of, removal, of, carbon, from, the, atmosphere, and, ocean, via, organic, carbon, burial, the, climate, also, controlled, the, availability, of, phosphate, through, its, regulation, of, rates, of, continental, and, seafloor, weathering, major, global, temperature, variations, of, 7, c, during, the, phanerozoic, were, strongly, associated, with, mass, extinctions
