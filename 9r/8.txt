research, is, creative, and, systematic, work, undertaken, to, increase, the, stock, of, knowledge, it, involves, the, collection, organization, and, analysis, of, evidence, to, increase, understanding, of, a, topic, characterized, by, a, particular, attentiveness, to, controlling, sources, of, bias, and, error, these, activities, are, characterized, by, accounting, and, controlling, for, biases, a, research, project, may, be, an, expansion, of, past, work, in, the, field, to, test, the, validity, of, instruments, procedures, or, experiments, research, may, replicate, elements, of, prior, projects, or, the, project, as, a, whole, the, primary, purposes, of, basic, research, as, opposed, to, applied, research, are, documentation, discovery, interpretation, and, the, research, and, development, r, d, of, methods, and, systems, for, the, advancement, of, human, knowledge, approaches, to, research, depend, on, epistemologies, which, vary, considerably, both, within, and, between, humanities, and, sciences, there, are, several, forms, of, research, scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social, business, marketing, practitioner, research, life, technological, etc, the, scientific, study, of, research, practices, is, known, as, meta, research, a, researcher, is, a, person, engaged, in, conducting, research, possibly, recognized, as, an, occupation, by, a, formal, job, title, in, order, to, be, a, social, researcher, or, a, social, scientist, one, should, have, enormous, knowledge, of, subjects, related, to, social, science, that, they, are, specialized, in, similarly, in, order, to, be, a, natural, science, researcher, the, person, should, have, knowledge, of, fields, related, to, natural, science, physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, zoology, and, so, on, professional, associations, provide, one, pathway, to, mature, in, the, research, profession, the, word, research, is, derived, from, the, middle, french, recherche, which, means, to, go, about, seeking, the, term, itself, being, derived, from, the, old, french, term, recerchier, a, compound, word, from, re, cerchier, or, sercher, meaning, search, the, earliest, recorded, use, of, the, term, was, in, 1577, research, has, been, defined, in, a, number, of, different, ways, and, while, there, are, similarities, there, does, not, appear, to, be, a, single, all, encompassing, definition, that, is, embraced, by, all, who, engage, in, it, research, in, its, simplest, terms, is, searching, for, knowledge, and, searching, for, truth, in, a, formal, sense, it, is, a, systematic, study, of, a, problem, attacked, by, a, deliberately, chosen, strategy, which, starts, with, choosing, an, approach, to, preparing, a, blueprint, design, and, acting, upon, it, in, terms, of, designing, research, hypotheses, choosing, methods, and, techniques, selecting, or, developing, data, collection, tools, processing, the, data, interpretation, and, ending, with, presenting, solution, s, of, the, problem, another, definition, of, research, is, given, by, john, w, creswell, who, states, that, research, is, a, process, of, steps, used, to, collect, and, analyze, information, to, increase, our, understanding, of, a, topic, or, issue, it, consists, of, three, steps, pose, a, question, collect, data, to, answer, the, question, and, present, an, answer, to, the, question, the, merriam, webster, online, dictionary, defines, research, more, generally, to, also, include, studying, already, existing, knowledge, studious, inquiry, or, examination, especially, investigation, or, experimentation, aimed, at, the, discovery, and, interpretation, of, facts, revision, of, accepted, theories, or, laws, in, the, light, of, new, facts, or, practical, application, of, such, new, or, revised, theories, or, laws, original, research, also, called, primary, research, is, research, that, is, not, exclusively, based, on, a, summary, review, or, synthesis, of, earlier, publications, on, the, subject, of, research, this, material, is, of, a, primary, source, character, the, purpose, of, the, original, research, is, to, produce, new, knowledge, rather, than, present, the, existing, knowledge, in, a, new, form, e, g, summarized, or, classified, original, research, can, take, various, forms, depending, on, the, discipline, it, pertains, to, in, experimental, work, it, typically, involves, direct, or, indirect, observation, of, the, researched, subject, s, e, g, in, the, laboratory, or, in, the, field, documents, the, methodology, results, and, conclusions, of, an, experiment, or, set, of, experiments, or, offers, a, novel, interpretation, of, previous, results, in, analytical, work, there, are, typically, some, new, for, example, mathematical, results, produced, or, a, new, way, of, approaching, an, existing, problem, in, some, subjects, which, do, not, typically, carry, out, experimentation, or, analysis, of, this, kind, the, originality, is, in, the, particular, way, existing, understanding, is, changed, or, re, interpreted, based, on, the, outcome, of, the, work, of, the, researcher, the, degree, of, originality, of, the, research, is, among, the, major, criteria, for, articles, to, be, published, in, academic, journals, and, usually, established, by, means, of, peer, review, graduate, students, are, commonly, required, to, perform, original, research, as, part, of, a, dissertation, scientific, research, is, a, systematic, way, of, gathering, data, and, harnessing, curiosity, this, research, provides, scientific, information, and, theories, for, the, explanation, of, the, nature, and, the, properties, of, the, world, it, makes, practical, applications, possible, scientific, research, may, be, funded, by, public, authorities, charitable, organizations, and, private, organizations, scientific, research, can, be, subdivided, by, discipline, generally, research, is, understood, to, follow, a, certain, structural, process, though, the, order, may, vary, depending, on, the, subject, matter, and, researcher, the, following, steps, are, usually, part, of, most, formal, research, both, basic, and, applied, a, common, misconception, is, that, a, hypothesis, will, be, proven, see, rather, null, hypothesis, generally, a, hypothesis, is, used, to, make, predictions, that, can, be, tested, by, observing, the, outcome, of, an, experiment, if, the, outcome, is, inconsistent, with, the, hypothesis, then, the, hypothesis, is, rejected, see, falsifiability, however, if, the, outcome, is, consistent, with, the, hypothesis, the, experiment, is, said, to, support, the, hypothesis, this, careful, language, is, used, because, researchers, recognize, that, alternative, hypotheses, may, also, be, consistent, with, the, observations, in, this, sense, a, hypothesis, can, never, be, proven, but, rather, only, supported, by, surviving, rounds, of, scientific, testing, and, eventually, becoming, widely, thought, of, as, true, a, useful, hypothesis, allows, prediction, and, within, the, accuracy, of, observation, of, the, time, the, prediction, will, be, verified, as, the, accuracy, of, observation, improves, with, time, the, hypothesis, may, no, longer, provide, an, accurate, prediction, in, this, case, a, new, hypothesis, will, arise, to, challenge, the, old, and, to, the, extent, that, the, new, hypothesis, makes, more, accurate, predictions, than, the, old, the, new, will, supplant, it, researchers, can, also, use, a, null, hypothesis, which, states, no, relationship, or, difference, between, the, independent, or, dependent, variables, research, in, the, humanities, involves, different, methods, such, as, for, example, hermeneutics, and, semiotics, humanities, scholars, usually, do, not, search, for, the, ultimate, correct, answer, to, a, question, but, instead, explore, the, issues, and, details, that, surround, it, context, is, always, important, and, context, can, be, social, historical, political, cultural, or, ethnic, an, example, of, research, in, the, humanities, is, historical, research, which, is, embodied, in, historical, method, historians, use, primary, sources, and, other, evidence, to, systematically, investigate, a, topic, and, then, to, write, histories, in, the, form, of, accounts, of, the, past, other, studies, aim, to, merely, examine, the, occurrence, of, behaviours, in, societies, and, communities, without, particularly, looking, for, reasons, or, motivations, to, explain, these, these, studies, may, be, qualitative, or, quantitative, and, can, use, a, variety, of, approaches, such, as, queer, theory, or, feminist, theory, artistic, research, also, seen, as, practice, based, research, can, take, form, when, creative, works, are, considered, both, the, research, and, the, object, of, research, itself, it, is, the, debatable, body, of, thought, which, offers, an, alternative, to, purely, scientific, methods, in, research, in, its, search, for, knowledge, and, truth, the, controversial, trend, of, artistic, teaching, becoming, more, academics, oriented, is, leading, to, artistic, research, being, accepted, as, the, primary, mode, of, enquiry, in, art, as, in, the, case, of, other, disciplines, one, of, the, characteristics, of, artistic, research, is, that, it, must, accept, subjectivity, as, opposed, to, the, classical, scientific, methods, as, such, it, is, similar, to, the, social, sciences, in, using, qualitative, research, and, intersubjectivity, as, tools, to, apply, measurement, and, critical, analysis, artistic, research, has, been, defined, by, the, school, of, dance, and, circus, dans, och, cirkush, gskolan, doch, stockholm, in, the, following, manner, artistic, research, is, to, investigate, and, test, with, the, purpose, of, gaining, knowledge, within, and, for, our, artistic, disciplines, it, is, based, on, artistic, practices, methods, and, criticality, through, presented, documentation, the, insights, gained, shall, be, placed, in, a, context, artistic, research, aims, to, enhance, knowledge, and, understanding, with, presentation, of, the, arts, a, simpler, understanding, by, julian, klein, defines, artistic, research, as, any, kind, of, research, employing, the, artistic, mode, of, perception, for, a, survey, of, the, central, problematics, of, today, s, artistic, research, see, giaco, schiesser, according, to, artist, hakan, topal, in, artistic, research, perhaps, more, so, than, other, disciplines, intuition, is, utilized, as, a, method, to, identify, a, wide, range, of, new, and, unexpected, productive, modalities, most, writers, whether, of, fiction, or, non, fiction, books, also, have, to, do, research, to, support, their, creative, work, this, may, be, factual, historical, or, background, research, background, research, could, include, for, example, geographical, or, procedural, research, the, society, for, artistic, research, sar, publishes, the, triannual, journal, for, artistic, research, jar, an, international, online, open, access, and, peer, reviewed, journal, for, the, identification, publication, and, dissemination, of, artistic, research, and, its, methodologies, from, all, arts, disciplines, and, it, runs, the, research, catalogue, rc, a, searchable, documentary, database, of, artistic, research, to, which, anyone, can, contribute, patricia, leavy, addresses, eight, arts, based, research, abr, genres, narrative, inquiry, fiction, based, research, poetry, music, dance, theatre, film, and, visual, art, in, 2016, the, european, league, of, institutes, of, the, arts, launched, the, florence, principles, on, the, doctorate, in, the, arts, the, florence, principles, relating, to, the, salzburg, principles, and, the, salzburg, recommendations, of, the, european, university, association, name, seven, points, of, attention, to, specify, the, doctorate, phd, in, the, arts, compared, to, a, scientific, doctorate, phd, the, florence, principles, have, been, endorsed, and, are, supported, also, by, aec, cilect, cumulus, and, sar, the, historical, method, comprises, the, techniques, and, guidelines, by, which, historians, use, historical, sources, and, other, evidence, to, research, and, then, to, write, history, there, are, various, history, guidelines, that, are, commonly, used, by, historians, in, their, work, under, the, headings, of, external, criticism, internal, criticism, and, synthesis, this, includes, lower, criticism, and, sensual, criticism, though, items, may, vary, depending, on, the, subject, matter, and, researcher, the, following, concepts, are, part, of, most, formal, historical, research, research, is, often, conducted, using, the, hourglass, model, structure, of, research, the, hourglass, model, starts, with, a, broad, spectrum, for, research, focusing, in, on, the, required, information, through, the, method, of, the, project, like, the, neck, of, the, hourglass, then, expands, the, research, in, the, form, of, discussion, and, results, the, major, steps, in, conducting, research, are, the, steps, generally, represent, the, overall, process, however, they, should, be, viewed, as, an, ever, changing, iterative, process, rather, than, a, fixed, set, of, steps, most, research, begins, with, a, general, statement, of, the, problem, or, rather, the, purpose, for, engaging, in, the, study, the, literature, review, identifies, flaws, or, holes, in, previous, research, which, provides, justification, for, the, study, often, a, literature, review, is, conducted, in, a, given, subject, area, before, a, research, question, is, identified, a, gap, in, the, current, literature, as, identified, by, a, researcher, then, engenders, a, research, question, the, research, question, may, be, parallel, to, the, hypothesis, the, hypothesis, is, the, supposition, to, be, tested, the, researcher, s, collects, data, to, test, the, hypothesis, the, researcher, s, then, analyzes, and, interprets, the, data, via, a, variety, of, statistical, methods, engaging, in, what, is, known, as, empirical, research, the, results, of, the, data, analysis, in, rejecting, or, failing, to, reject, the, null, hypothesis, are, then, reported, and, evaluated, at, the, end, the, researcher, may, discuss, avenues, for, further, research, however, some, researchers, advocate, for, the, reverse, approach, starting, with, articulating, findings, and, discussion, of, them, moving, up, to, identification, of, a, research, problem, that, emerges, in, the, findings, and, literature, review, the, reverse, approach, is, justified, by, the, transactional, nature, of, the, research, endeavor, where, research, inquiry, research, questions, research, method, relevant, research, literature, and, so, on, are, not, fully, known, until, the, findings, have, fully, emerged, and, been, interpreted, rudolph, rummel, says, no, researcher, should, accept, any, one, or, two, tests, as, definitive, it, is, only, when, a, range, of, tests, are, consistent, over, many, kinds, of, data, researchers, and, methods, can, one, have, confidence, in, the, results, plato, in, meno, talks, about, an, inherent, difficulty, if, not, a, paradox, of, doing, research, that, can, be, paraphrased, in, the, following, way, if, you, know, what, you, re, searching, for, why, do, you, search, for, it, if, you, don, t, know, what, you, re, searching, for, what, are, you, searching, for, the, goal, of, the, research, process, is, to, produce, new, knowledge, or, deepen, understanding, of, a, topic, or, issue, this, process, takes, three, main, forms, although, as, previously, discussed, the, boundaries, between, them, may, be, obscure, there, are, two, major, types, of, empirical, research, design, qualitative, research, and, quantitative, research, researchers, choose, qualitative, or, quantitative, methods, according, to, the, nature, of, the, research, topic, they, want, to, investigate, and, the, research, questions, they, aim, to, answer, qualitative, research, refers, to, much, more, subjective, non, quantitative, use, different, methods, of, collecting, data, analyzing, data, interpreting, data, for, meanings, definitions, characteristics, symbols, metaphors, of, things, qualitative, research, further, classified, into, following, types, ethnography, this, research, mainly, focus, on, culture, of, group, of, people, which, includes, share, attributes, language, practices, structure, value, norms, and, material, things, evaluate, human, lifestyle, ethno, people, grapho, to, write, this, disciple, may, include, ethnic, groups, ethno, genesis, composition, resettlement, and, social, welfare, characteristics, phenomenology, it, is, very, powerful, strategy, for, demonstrating, methodology, to, health, professions, education, as, well, as, best, suited, for, exploring, challenging, problems, in, health, professions, educations, in, addition, pmp, researcher, mandy, sha, argued, that, a, project, management, approach, is, necessary, to, control, the, scope, schedule, and, cost, related, to, qualitative, research, design, participant, recruitment, data, collection, reporting, as, well, as, stakeholder, engagement, the, quantitative, data, collection, methods, rely, on, random, sampling, and, structured, data, collection, instruments, that, fit, diverse, experiences, into, predetermined, response, categories, these, methods, produce, results, that, can, be, summarized, compared, and, generalized, to, larger, populations, if, the, data, are, collected, using, proper, sampling, and, data, collection, strategies, quantitative, research, is, concerned, with, testing, hypotheses, derived, from, theory, or, being, able, to, estimate, the, size, of, a, phenomenon, of, interest, if, the, research, question, is, about, people, participants, may, be, randomly, assigned, to, different, treatments, this, is, the, only, way, that, a, quantitative, study, can, be, considered, a, true, experiment, if, this, is, not, feasible, the, researcher, may, collect, data, on, participant, and, situational, characteristics, to, statistically, control, for, their, influence, on, the, dependent, or, outcome, variable, if, the, intent, is, to, generalize, from, the, research, participants, to, a, larger, population, the, researcher, will, employ, probability, sampling, to, select, participants, in, either, qualitative, or, quantitative, research, the, researcher, s, may, collect, primary, or, secondary, data, primary, data, is, data, collected, specifically, for, the, research, such, as, through, interviews, or, questionnaires, secondary, data, is, data, that, already, exists, such, as, census, data, which, can, be, re, used, for, the, research, it, is, good, ethical, research, practice, to, use, secondary, data, wherever, possible, mixed, method, research, i, e, research, that, includes, qualitative, and, quantitative, elements, using, both, primary, and, secondary, data, is, becoming, more, common, this, method, has, benefits, that, using, one, method, alone, cannot, offer, for, example, a, researcher, may, choose, to, conduct, a, qualitative, study, and, follow, it, up, with, a, quantitative, study, to, gain, additional, insights, big, data, has, brought, big, impacts, on, research, methods, so, that, now, many, researchers, do, not, put, much, effort, into, data, collection, furthermore, methods, to, analyze, easily, available, huge, amounts, of, data, have, also, been, developed, types, of, research, method, 1, observatory, research, method, 2, correlation, research, method, non, empirical, theoretical, research, is, an, approach, that, involves, the, development, of, theory, as, opposed, to, using, observation, and, experimentation, as, such, non, empirical, research, seeks, solutions, to, problems, using, existing, knowledge, as, its, source, this, however, does, not, mean, that, new, ideas, and, innovations, cannot, be, found, within, the, pool, of, existing, and, established, knowledge, non, empirical, research, is, not, an, absolute, alternative, to, empirical, research, because, they, may, be, used, together, to, strengthen, a, research, approach, neither, one, is, less, effective, than, the, other, since, they, have, their, particular, purpose, in, science, typically, empirical, research, produces, observations, that, need, to, be, explained, then, theoretical, research, tries, to, explain, them, and, in, so, doing, generates, empirically, testable, hypotheses, these, hypotheses, are, then, tested, empirically, giving, more, observations, that, may, need, further, explanation, and, so, on, see, scientific, method, a, simple, example, of, a, non, empirical, task, is, the, prototyping, of, a, new, drug, using, a, differentiated, application, of, existing, knowledge, another, is, the, development, of, a, business, process, in, the, form, of, a, flow, chart, and, texts, where, all, the, ingredients, are, from, established, knowledge, much, of, cosmological, research, is, theoretical, in, nature, mathematics, research, does, not, rely, on, externally, available, data, rather, it, seeks, to, prove, theorems, about, mathematical, objects, research, ethics, is, a, discipline, within, the, study, of, applied, ethics, its, scope, ranges, from, general, scientific, integrity, and, misconduct, to, the, treatment, of, human, and, animal, subjects, the, societal, responsibilities, that, science, and, research, have, are, not, traditionally, included, and, are, less, well, defined, the, discipline, is, most, developed, in, medical, research, beyond, the, issues, of, falsification, fabrication, and, plagiarism, that, arise, in, every, scientific, field, research, design, in, human, subject, research, and, animal, testing, are, the, areas, that, raise, ethical, questions, most, often, the, list, of, historic, cases, includes, many, large, scale, violations, and, crimes, against, humanity, such, as, nazi, human, experimentation, and, the, tuskegee, syphilis, experiment, which, led, to, international, codes, of, research, ethics, no, approach, has, been, universally, accepted, but, typically, cited, codes, are, the, 1947, nuremberg, code, the, 1964, declaration, of, helsinki, and, the, 1978, belmont, report, today, research, ethics, committees, such, as, those, of, the, us, uk, and, eu, govern, and, oversee, the, responsible, conduct, of, research, meta, research, is, the, study, of, research, through, the, use, of, research, methods, also, known, as, research, on, research, it, aims, to, reduce, waste, and, increase, the, quality, of, research, in, all, fields, meta, research, concerns, itself, with, the, detection, of, bias, methodological, flaws, and, other, errors, and, inefficiencies, among, the, finding, of, meta, research, is, a, low, rates, of, reproducibility, across, a, large, number, of, fields, this, widespread, difficulty, in, reproducing, research, has, been, termed, the, replication, crisis, in, many, disciplines, western, methods, of, conducting, research, are, predominant, researchers, are, overwhelmingly, taught, western, methods, of, data, collection, and, study, the, increasing, participation, of, indigenous, peoples, as, researchers, has, brought, increased, attention, to, the, scientific, lacuna, in, culturally, sensitive, methods, of, data, collection, western, methods, of, data, collection, may, not, be, the, most, accurate, or, relevant, for, research, on, non, western, societies, for, example, hua, oranga, was, created, as, a, criterion, for, psychological, evaluation, in, m, ori, populations, and, is, based, on, dimensions, of, mental, health, important, to, the, m, ori, people, taha, wairua, the, spiritual, dimension, taha, hinengaro, the, mental, dimension, taha, tinana, the, physical, dimension, and, taha, whanau, the, family, dimension, research, is, often, biased, in, the, languages, that, are, preferred, linguicism, and, the, geographic, locations, where, research, occurs, periphery, scholars, face, the, challenges, of, exclusion, and, linguicism, in, research, and, academic, publication, as, the, great, majority, of, mainstream, academic, journals, are, written, in, english, multilingual, periphery, scholars, often, must, translate, their, work, to, be, accepted, to, elite, western, dominated, journals, multilingual, scholars, influences, from, their, native, communicative, styles, can, be, assumed, to, be, incompetence, instead, of, difference, for, comparative, politics, western, countries, are, over, represented, in, single, country, studies, with, heavy, emphasis, on, western, europe, canada, australia, and, new, zealand, since, 2000, latin, american, countries, have, become, more, popular, in, single, country, studies, in, contrast, countries, in, oceania, and, the, caribbean, are, the, focus, of, very, few, studies, patterns, of, geographic, bias, also, show, a, relationship, with, linguicism, countries, whose, official, languages, are, french, or, arabic, are, far, less, likely, to, be, the, focus, of, single, country, studies, than, countries, with, different, official, languages, within, africa, english, speaking, countries, are, more, represented, than, other, countries, generalization, is, the, process, of, more, broadly, applying, the, valid, results, of, one, study, studies, with, a, narrow, scope, can, result, in, a, lack, of, generalizability, meaning, that, the, results, may, not, be, applicable, to, other, populations, or, regions, in, comparative, politics, this, can, result, from, using, a, single, country, study, rather, than, a, study, design, that, uses, data, from, multiple, countries, despite, the, issue, of, generalizability, single, country, studies, have, risen, in, prevalence, since, the, late, 2000s, peer, review, is, a, form, of, self, regulation, by, qualified, members, of, a, profession, within, the, relevant, field, peer, review, methods, are, employed, to, maintain, standards, of, quality, improve, performance, and, provide, credibility, in, academia, scholarly, peer, review, is, often, used, to, determine, an, academic, paper, s, suitability, for, publication, usually, the, peer, review, process, involves, experts, in, the, same, field, who, are, consulted, by, editors, to, give, a, review, of, the, scholarly, works, produced, by, a, colleague, of, theirs, from, an, unbiased, and, impartial, point, of, view, and, this, is, usually, done, free, of, charge, the, tradition, of, peer, reviews, being, done, for, free, has, however, brought, many, pitfalls, which, are, also, indicative, of, why, most, peer, reviewers, decline, many, invitations, to, review, it, was, observed, that, publications, from, periphery, countries, rarely, rise, to, the, same, elite, status, as, those, of, north, america, and, europe, because, limitations, on, the, availability, of, resources, including, high, quality, paper, and, sophisticated, image, rendering, software, and, printing, tools, render, these, publications, less, able, to, satisfy, standards, currently, carrying, formal, or, informal, authority, in, the, publishing, industry, these, limitations, in, turn, result, in, the, under, representation, of, scholars, from, periphery, nations, among, the, set, of, publications, holding, prestige, status, relative, to, the, quantity, and, quality, of, those, scholars, research, efforts, and, this, under, representation, in, turn, results, in, disproportionately, reduced, acceptance, of, the, results, of, their, efforts, as, contributions, to, the, body, of, knowledge, available, worldwide, the, open, access, movement, assumes, that, all, information, generally, deemed, useful, should, be, free, and, belongs, to, a, public, domain, that, of, humanity, this, idea, gained, prevalence, as, a, result, of, western, colonial, history, and, ignores, alternative, conceptions, of, knowledge, circulation, for, instance, most, indigenous, communities, consider, that, access, to, certain, information, proper, to, the, group, should, be, determined, by, relationships, there, is, alleged, to, be, a, double, standard, in, the, western, knowledge, system, on, the, one, hand, digital, right, management, used, to, restrict, access, to, personal, information, on, social, networking, platforms, is, celebrated, as, a, protection, of, privacy, while, simultaneously, when, similar, functions, are, used, by, cultural, groups, i, e, indigenous, communities, this, is, denounced, as, access, control, and, reprehended, as, censorship, even, though, western, dominance, seems, to, be, prominent, in, research, some, scholars, such, as, simon, marginson, argue, for, the, need, a, plural, university, world, marginson, argues, that, the, east, asian, confucian, model, could, take, over, the, western, model, this, could, be, due, to, changes, in, funding, for, research, both, in, the, east, and, the, west, focused, on, emphasizing, educational, achievement, east, asian, cultures, mainly, in, china, and, south, korea, have, encouraged, the, increase, of, funding, for, research, expansion, in, contrast, in, the, western, academic, world, notably, in, the, united, kingdom, as, well, as, in, some, state, governments, in, the, united, states, funding, cuts, for, university, research, have, occurred, which, some, say, may, lead, to, the, future, decline, of, western, dominance, in, research, neo, colonial, research, or, neo, colonial, science, frequently, described, as, helicopter, research, parachute, science, or, research, parasitic, research, or, safari, study, is, when, researchers, from, wealthier, countries, go, to, a, developing, country, collect, information, travel, back, to, their, country, analyze, the, data, and, samples, and, publish, the, results, with, no, or, little, involvement, of, local, researchers, a, 2003, study, by, the, hungarian, academy, of, sciences, found, that, 70, of, articles, in, a, random, sample, of, publications, about, least, developed, countries, did, not, include, a, local, research, co, author, frequently, during, this, kind, of, research, the, local, colleagues, might, be, used, to, provide, logistics, support, as, fixers, but, are, not, engaged, for, their, expertise, or, given, credit, for, their, participation, in, the, research, scientific, publications, resulting, from, parachute, science, frequently, only, contribute, to, the, career, of, the, scientists, from, rich, countries, thus, limiting, the, development, of, local, science, capacity, such, as, funded, research, centers, and, the, careers, of, local, scientists, this, form, of, colonial, science, has, reverberations, of, 19th, century, scientific, practices, of, treating, non, western, participants, as, others, in, order, to, advance, colonialism, and, critics, call, for, the, end, of, these, extractivist, practices, in, order, to, decolonize, knowledge, in, several, national, and, private, academic, systems, the, professionalisation, of, research, has, resulted, in, formal, job, titles, in, present, day, russia, and, some, other, countries, of, the, former, soviet, union, the, term, researcher, russian, nauchny, sotrudnik, has, been, used, both, as, a, generic, term, for, a, person, who, has, been, carrying, out, scientific, research, and, as, a, job, position, within, the, frameworks, of, the, academy, of, sciences, universities, and, in, other, research, oriented, establishments, the, following, ranks, are, known, academic, publishing, is, a, system, that, is, necessary, for, academic, scholars, to, peer, review, the, work, and, make, it, available, for, a, wider, audience, the, system, varies, widely, by, field, and, is, also, always, changing, if, often, slowly, most, academic, work, is, published, in, journal, article, or, book, form, there, is, also, a, large, body, of, research, that, exists, in, either, a, thesis, or, dissertation, form, these, forms, of, research, can, be, found, in, databases, explicitly, for, theses, and, dissertations, in, publishing, stm, publishing, is, an, abbreviation, for, academic, publications, in, science, technology, and, medicine, most, established, academic, fields, have, their, own, scientific, journals, and, other, outlets, for, publication, though, many, academic, journals, are, somewhat, interdisciplinary, and, publish, work, from, several, distinct, fields, or, subfields, the, kinds, of, publications, that, are, accepted, as, contributions, of, knowledge, or, research, vary, greatly, between, fields, from, the, print, to, the, electronic, format, a, study, suggests, that, researchers, should, not, give, great, consideration, to, findings, that, are, not, replicated, frequently, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, all, published, studies, should, be, subjected, to, some, measure, for, assessing, the, validity, or, reliability, of, its, procedures, to, prevent, the, publication, of, unproven, findings, business, models, are, different, in, the, electronic, environment, since, about, the, early, 1990s, licensing, of, electronic, resources, particularly, journals, has, been, very, common, presently, a, major, trend, particularly, with, respect, to, scholarly, journals, is, open, access, there, are, two, main, forms, of, open, access, open, access, publishing, in, which, the, articles, or, the, whole, journal, is, freely, available, from, the, time, of, publication, and, self, archiving, where, the, author, makes, a, copy, of, their, own, work, freely, available, on, the, web, most, funding, for, scientific, research, comes, from, three, major, sources, corporate, research, and, development, departments, private, foundations, and, government, research, councils, such, as, the, national, institutes, of, health, in, the, us, and, the, medical, research, council, in, the, uk, these, are, managed, primarily, through, universities, and, in, some, cases, through, military, contractors, many, senior, researchers, such, as, group, leaders, spend, a, significant, amount, of, their, time, applying, for, grants, for, research, funds, these, grants, are, necessary, not, only, for, researchers, to, carry, out, their, research, but, also, as, a, source, of, merit, the, social, psychology, network, provides, a, comprehensive, list, of, u, s, government, and, private, foundation, funding, sources, the, total, number, of, researchers, full, time, equivalents, per, million, inhabitants, for, individual, countries, is, shown, in, the, following, table, research, expenditure, by, type, of, research, as, a, share, of, gdp, for, individual, countries, is, shown, in, the, following, table
