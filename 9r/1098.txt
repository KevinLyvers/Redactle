noise, is, sound, chiefly, unwanted, unintentional, or, harmful, sound, considered, unpleasant, loud, or, disruptive, to, mental, or, hearing, faculties, from, a, physics, standpoint, there, is, no, distinction, between, noise, and, desired, sound, as, both, are, vibrations, through, a, medium, such, as, air, or, water, the, difference, arises, when, the, brain, receives, and, perceives, a, sound, acoustic, noise, is, any, sound, in, the, acoustic, domain, either, deliberate, e, g, music, or, speech, or, unintended, in, contrast, noise, in, electronics, may, not, be, audible, to, the, human, ear, and, may, require, instruments, for, detection, in, audio, engineering, noise, can, refer, to, the, unwanted, residual, electronic, noise, signal, that, gives, rise, to, acoustic, noise, heard, as, a, hiss, this, signal, noise, is, commonly, measured, using, a, weighting, or, itu, r, 468, weighting, in, experimental, sciences, noise, can, refer, to, any, random, fluctuations, of, data, that, hinders, perception, of, a, signal, sound, is, measured, based, on, the, amplitude, and, frequency, of, a, sound, wave, amplitude, measures, how, forceful, the, wave, is, the, energy, in, a, sound, wave, is, measured, in, decibels, db, the, measure, of, loudness, or, intensity, of, a, sound, this, measurement, describes, the, amplitude, of, a, sound, wave, decibels, are, expressed, in, a, logarithmic, scale, on, the, other, hand, pitch, describes, the, frequency, of, a, sound, and, is, measured, in, hertz, hz, the, main, instrument, to, measure, sounds, in, the, air, is, the, sound, level, meter, there, are, many, different, varieties, of, instruments, that, are, used, to, measure, noise, noise, dosimeters, are, often, used, in, occupational, environments, noise, monitors, are, used, to, measure, environmental, noise, and, noise, pollution, and, recently, smartphone, based, sound, level, meter, applications, apps, are, being, used, to, crowdsource, and, map, recreational, and, community, noise, a, weighting, is, applied, to, a, sound, spectrum, to, represent, the, sound, that, humans, are, capable, of, hearing, at, each, frequency, sound, pressure, is, thus, expressed, in, terms, of, dba, 0, dba, is, the, softest, level, that, a, person, can, hear, normal, speaking, voices, are, around, 65, dba, a, rock, concert, can, be, about, 120, dba, in, audio, recording, and, broadcast, systems, audio, noise, refers, to, the, residual, low, level, sound, four, major, types, hiss, rumble, crackle, and, hum, that, is, heard, in, quiet, periods, of, program, this, variation, from, the, expected, pure, sound, or, silence, can, be, caused, by, the, audio, recording, equipment, the, instrument, or, ambient, noise, in, the, recording, room, in, audio, engineering, it, can, refer, either, to, the, acoustic, noise, from, loudspeakers, or, to, the, unwanted, residual, electronic, noise, signal, that, gives, rise, to, acoustic, noise, heard, as, hiss, this, signal, noise, is, commonly, measured, using, a, weighting, or, itu, r, 468, weighting, noise, is, often, generated, deliberately, and, used, as, a, test, signal, for, audio, recording, and, reproduction, equipment, environmental, noise, is, the, accumulation, of, all, noise, present, in, a, specified, environment, the, principal, sources, of, environmental, noise, are, surface, motor, vehicles, aircraft, trains, and, industrial, sources, these, noise, sources, expose, millions, of, people, to, noise, pollution, that, creates, not, only, annoyance, but, also, significant, health, consequences, such, as, elevated, incidence, of, hearing, loss, cardiovascular, disease, and, many, others, urban, noise, is, generally, not, of, an, intensity, that, causes, hearing, loss, but, it, interrupts, sleep, disturbs, communication, and, interferes, with, other, human, activities, there, are, a, variety, of, mitigation, strategies, and, controls, available, to, reduce, sound, levels, including, source, intensity, reduction, land, use, planning, strategies, noise, barriers, and, sound, baffles, time, of, day, use, regimens, vehicle, operational, controls, and, architectural, acoustics, design, measures, certain, geographic, areas, or, specific, occupations, may, be, at, a, higher, risk, of, being, exposed, to, constantly, high, levels, of, noise, regulation, may, prevent, negative, health, outcomes, noise, regulation, includes, statutes, or, guidelines, relating, to, sound, transmission, established, by, national, state, or, provincial, and, municipal, levels, of, government, environmental, noise, is, governed, by, laws, and, standards, which, set, maximum, recommended, levels, of, noise, for, specific, land, uses, such, as, residential, areas, areas, of, outstanding, natural, beauty, or, schools, these, standards, usually, specify, measurement, using, a, weighting, filter, most, often, a, weighting, in, 1972, the, noise, control, act, was, passed, to, promote, a, healthy, living, environment, for, all, americans, where, noise, does, not, pose, a, threat, to, human, health, this, policy, s, main, objectives, were, 1, establish, coordination, of, research, in, the, area, of, noise, control, 2, establish, federal, standards, on, noise, emission, for, commercial, products, and, 3, promote, public, awareness, about, noise, emission, and, reduction, the, quiet, communities, act, of, 1978, promotes, noise, control, programs, at, the, state, and, local, level, and, developed, a, research, program, on, noise, control, both, laws, authorized, the, environmental, protection, agency, to, study, the, effects, of, noise, and, evaluate, regulations, regarding, noise, control, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, provides, recommendation, on, noise, exposure, in, the, workplace, in, 1972, revised, in, 1998, niosh, published, a, document, outlining, recommended, standards, relating, to, the, occupational, exposure, to, noise, with, the, purpose, of, reducing, the, risk, of, developing, permanent, hearing, loss, related, to, exposure, at, work, this, publication, set, the, recommended, exposure, limit, rel, of, noise, in, an, occupation, setting, to, 85, dba, for, 8, hours, using, a, 3, db, exchange, rate, every, 3, db, increase, in, level, duration, of, exposure, should, be, cut, in, half, i, e, 88, dba, for, 4, hours, 91, dba, for, 2, hours, 94, dba, for, 1, hour, etc, however, in, 1973, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, maintained, the, requirement, of, an, 8, hour, average, of, 90, dba, the, following, year, osha, required, employers, to, provide, a, hearing, conservation, program, to, workers, exposed, to, 85, dba, average, 8, hour, workdays, the, european, environment, agency, regulates, noise, control, and, surveillance, within, the, european, union, the, environmental, noise, directive, was, set, to, determine, levels, of, noise, exposure, increase, public, access, to, information, regarding, environmental, noise, and, reduce, environmental, noise, additionally, in, the, european, union, underwater, noise, is, a, pollutant, according, to, the, marine, strategy, framework, directive, msfd, the, msfd, requires, eu, member, states, to, achieve, or, maintain, good, environmental, status, meaning, that, the, introduction, of, energy, including, underwater, noise, is, at, levels, that, do, not, adversely, affect, the, marine, environment, exposure, to, noise, is, associated, with, several, negative, health, outcomes, depending, on, duration, and, level, of, exposure, noise, may, cause, or, increase, the, likelihood, of, hearing, loss, high, blood, pressure, ischemic, heart, disease, sleep, disturbances, injuries, and, even, decreased, school, performance, when, noise, is, prolonged, the, body, s, stress, responses, can, be, triggered, which, can, include, increased, heartbeat, and, rapid, breathing, there, are, also, causal, relationships, between, noise, and, psychological, effects, such, as, annoyance, psychiatric, disorders, and, effects, on, psychosocial, well, being, noise, exposure, has, increasingly, been, identified, as, a, public, health, issue, especially, in, an, occupational, setting, as, demonstrated, with, the, creation, of, niosh, s, noise, and, hearing, loss, prevention, program, noise, has, also, proven, to, be, an, occupational, hazard, as, it, is, the, most, common, work, related, pollutant, noise, induced, hearing, loss, when, associated, with, noise, exposure, at, the, workplace, is, also, called, occupational, hearing, loss, for, example, some, occupational, studies, have, shown, a, relation, between, those, who, are, regularly, exposed, to, noise, above, 85, decibels, to, have, higher, blood, pressure, than, those, who, are, not, exposed, while, noise, induced, hearing, loss, is, permanent, it, is, also, preventable, particularly, in, the, workplace, regulations, may, exist, limiting, permissible, exposure, limit, to, noise, this, can, be, especially, important, for, professionals, working, in, settings, with, consistent, exposure, to, loud, sounds, such, as, musicians, music, teachers, and, audio, engineers, examples, of, measures, taken, to, prevent, noise, induced, hearing, loss, in, the, workplace, include, engineering, noise, control, the, buy, quiet, initiative, creation, of, the, safe, in, sound, award, and, noise, surveillance, osha, requires, the, use, of, hearing, protection, but, the, hpd, without, individual, selection, training, and, fit, testing, does, not, significantly, reduce, the, risk, of, hearing, loss, for, example, one, study, covered, more, than, 19, thousand, workers, some, of, whom, usually, used, hearing, protective, devices, and, some, did, not, use, them, at, all, there, was, no, statistically, significant, difference, in, the, risk, of, noise, induced, hearing, loss, roland, barthes, distinguishes, between, physiological, noise, which, is, merely, heard, and, psychological, noise, which, is, actively, listened, to, physiological, noise, is, felt, subconsciously, as, the, vibrations, of, the, noise, sound, waves, physically, interact, with, the, body, while, psychological, noise, is, perceived, as, our, conscious, awareness, shifts, its, attention, to, that, noise, luigi, russolo, one, of, the, first, composers, of, noise, music, wrote, the, essay, the, art, of, noises, he, argued, that, any, kind, of, noise, could, be, used, as, music, as, audiences, become, more, familiar, with, noises, caused, by, technological, advancements, noise, has, become, so, prominent, that, pure, sound, no, longer, exists, avant, garde, composer, henry, cowell, claimed, that, technological, advancements, have, reduced, unwanted, noises, from, machines, but, have, not, managed, so, far, to, eliminate, them, felix, urban, sees, noise, as, a, result, of, cultural, circumstances, in, his, comparative, study, on, sound, and, noise, in, cities, he, points, out, that, noise, regulations, are, only, one, indicator, of, what, is, considered, as, harmful, it, is, the, way, in, which, people, live, and, behave, acoustically, that, determines, the, way, how, sounds, are, perceived
