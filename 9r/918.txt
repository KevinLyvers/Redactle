ultraviolet, uv, light, is, electromagnetic, radiation, of, wavelengths, of, 10, 400, nanometers, shorter, than, that, of, visible, light, but, longer, than, x, rays, uv, radiation, is, present, in, sunlight, and, constitutes, about, 10, of, the, total, electromagnetic, radiation, output, from, the, sun, it, is, also, produced, by, electric, arcs, cherenkov, radiation, and, specialized, lights, such, as, mercury, vapor, lamps, tanning, lamps, and, black, lights, the, photons, of, ultraviolet, have, greater, energy, than, those, of, visible, light, from, about, 3, 1, to, 12, electron, volts, around, the, minimum, energy, required, to, ionize, atoms, although, long, wavelength, ultraviolet, is, not, considered, an, ionizing, radiation, because, its, photons, lack, sufficient, energy, it, can, induce, chemical, reactions, and, cause, many, substances, to, glow, or, fluoresce, many, practical, applications, including, chemical, and, biological, effects, are, derived, from, the, way, that, uv, radiation, can, interact, with, organic, molecules, these, interactions, can, involve, absorption, or, adjusting, energy, states, in, molecules, but, do, not, necessarily, involve, heating, short, wave, ultraviolet, light, is, ionizing, radiation, consequently, short, wave, uv, damages, dna, and, sterilizes, surfaces, with, which, it, comes, into, contact, for, humans, suntan, and, sunburn, are, familiar, effects, of, exposure, of, the, skin, to, uv, light, along, with, an, increased, risk, of, skin, cancer, the, amount, of, uv, light, produced, by, the, sun, means, that, the, earth, would, not, be, able, to, sustain, life, on, dry, land, if, most, of, that, light, were, not, filtered, out, by, the, atmosphere, more, energetic, shorter, wavelength, extreme, uv, below, 121, nm, ionizes, air, so, strongly, that, it, is, absorbed, before, it, reaches, the, ground, however, ultraviolet, light, specifically, uvb, is, also, responsible, for, the, formation, of, vitamin, d, in, most, land, vertebrates, including, humans, the, uv, spectrum, thus, has, effects, both, beneficial, and, detrimental, to, life, the, lower, wavelength, limit, of, the, visible, spectrum, is, conventionally, taken, as, 400, nm, so, ultraviolet, rays, are, not, visible, to, humans, although, people, can, sometimes, perceive, light, at, shorter, wavelengths, than, this, insects, birds, and, some, mammals, can, see, near, uv, nuv, i, e, slightly, shorter, wavelengths, than, what, humans, can, see, ultraviolet, rays, are, usually, invisible, to, most, humans, the, lens, of, the, human, eye, blocks, most, radiation, in, the, wavelength, range, of, 300, 400, nm, shorter, wavelengths, are, blocked, by, the, cornea, humans, also, lack, color, receptor, adaptations, for, ultraviolet, rays, nevertheless, the, photoreceptors, of, the, retina, are, sensitive, to, near, uv, and, people, lacking, a, lens, a, condition, known, as, aphakia, perceive, near, uv, as, whitish, blue, or, whitish, violet, under, some, conditions, children, and, young, adults, can, see, ultraviolet, down, to, wavelengths, around, 310, nm, near, uv, radiation, is, visible, to, insects, some, mammals, and, some, birds, birds, have, a, fourth, color, receptor, for, ultraviolet, rays, this, coupled, with, eye, structures, that, transmit, more, uv, gives, smaller, birds, true, uv, vision, ultraviolet, means, beyond, violet, from, latin, ultra, beyond, violet, being, the, color, of, the, highest, frequencies, of, visible, light, ultraviolet, has, a, higher, frequency, thus, a, shorter, wavelength, than, violet, light, uv, radiation, was, discovered, in, 1801, when, the, german, physicist, johann, wilhelm, ritter, observed, that, invisible, rays, just, beyond, the, violet, end, of, the, visible, spectrum, darkened, silver, chloride, soaked, paper, more, quickly, than, violet, light, itself, he, called, them, de, oxidizing, rays, german, de, oxidierende, strahlen, to, emphasize, chemical, reactivity, and, to, distinguish, them, from, heat, rays, discovered, the, previous, year, at, the, other, end, of, the, visible, spectrum, the, simpler, term, chemical, rays, was, adopted, soon, afterwards, and, remained, popular, throughout, the, 19th, century, although, some, said, that, this, radiation, was, entirely, different, from, light, notably, john, william, draper, who, named, them, tithonic, rays, the, terms, chemical, rays, and, heat, rays, were, eventually, dropped, in, favor, of, ultraviolet, and, infrared, radiation, respectively, in, 1878, the, sterilizing, effect, of, short, wavelength, light, by, killing, bacteria, was, discovered, by, 1903, the, most, effective, wavelengths, were, known, to, be, around, 250, nm, in, 1960, the, effect, of, ultraviolet, radiation, on, dna, was, established, the, discovery, of, the, ultraviolet, radiation, with, wavelengths, below, 200, nm, named, vacuum, ultraviolet, because, it, is, strongly, absorbed, by, the, oxygen, in, air, was, made, in, 1893, by, german, physicist, victor, schumann, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, of, ultraviolet, radiation, uvr, defined, most, broadly, as, 10, 400, nanometers, can, be, subdivided, into, a, number, of, ranges, recommended, by, the, iso, standard, iso, 21348, several, solid, state, and, vacuum, devices, have, been, explored, for, use, in, different, parts, of, the, uv, spectrum, many, approaches, seek, to, adapt, visible, light, sensing, devices, but, these, can, suffer, from, unwanted, response, to, visible, light, and, various, instabilities, ultraviolet, can, be, detected, by, suitable, photodiodes, and, photocathodes, which, can, be, tailored, to, be, sensitive, to, different, parts, of, the, uv, spectrum, sensitive, uv, photomultipliers, are, available, spectrometers, and, radiometers, are, made, for, measurement, of, uv, radiation, silicon, detectors, are, used, across, the, spectrum, vacuum, uv, or, vuv, wavelengths, shorter, than, 200, nm, are, strongly, absorbed, by, molecular, oxygen, in, the, air, though, the, longer, wavelengths, around, 150, 200, nm, can, propagate, through, nitrogen, scientific, instruments, can, therefore, use, this, spectral, range, by, operating, in, an, oxygen, free, atmosphere, commonly, pure, nitrogen, without, the, need, for, costly, vacuum, chambers, significant, examples, include, 193, nm, photolithography, equipment, for, semiconductor, manufacturing, and, circular, dichroism, spectrometers, technology, for, vuv, instrumentation, was, largely, driven, by, solar, astronomy, for, many, decades, while, optics, can, be, used, to, remove, unwanted, visible, light, that, contaminates, the, vuv, in, general, detectors, can, be, limited, by, their, response, to, non, vuv, radiation, and, the, development, of, solar, blind, devices, has, been, an, important, area, of, research, wide, gap, solid, state, devices, or, vacuum, devices, with, high, cutoff, photocathodes, can, be, attractive, compared, to, silicon, diodes, extreme, uv, euv, or, sometimes, xuv, is, characterized, by, a, transition, in, the, physics, of, interaction, with, matter, wavelengths, longer, than, about, 30, nm, interact, mainly, with, the, outer, valence, electrons, of, atoms, while, wavelengths, shorter, than, that, interact, mainly, with, inner, shell, electrons, and, nuclei, the, long, end, of, the, euv, spectrum, is, set, by, a, prominent, he, spectral, line, at, 30, 4, nm, euv, is, strongly, absorbed, by, most, known, materials, but, synthesizing, multilayer, optics, that, reflect, up, to, about, 50, of, euv, radiation, at, normal, incidence, is, possible, this, technology, was, pioneered, by, the, nixt, and, mssta, sounding, rockets, in, the, 1990s, and, it, has, been, used, to, make, telescopes, for, solar, imaging, see, also, the, extreme, ultraviolet, explorer, satellite, some, sources, use, the, distinction, of, hard, uv, and, soft, uv, for, instance, in, the, case, of, astrophysics, the, boundary, may, be, at, the, lyman, limit, wavelength, 91, 2, nm, the, energy, needed, to, ionise, a, hydrogen, atom, from, its, ground, state, with, hard, uv, being, more, energetic, the, same, terms, may, also, be, used, in, other, fields, such, as, cosmetology, optoelectronic, etc, the, numerical, values, of, the, boundary, between, hard, soft, even, within, similar, scientific, fields, do, not, necessarily, coincide, for, example, one, applied, physics, publication, used, a, boundary, of, 190, nm, between, hard, and, soft, uv, regions, very, hot, objects, emit, uv, radiation, see, black, body, radiation, the, sun, emits, ultraviolet, radiation, at, all, wavelengths, including, the, extreme, ultraviolet, where, it, crosses, into, x, rays, at, 10, nm, extremely, hot, stars, such, as, o, and, b, type, emit, proportionally, more, uv, radiation, than, the, sun, sunlight, in, space, at, the, top, of, earth, s, atmosphere, see, solar, constant, is, composed, of, about, 50, infrared, light, 40, visible, light, and, 10, ultraviolet, light, for, a, total, intensity, of, about, 1400, w, m, 2, in, vacuum, the, atmosphere, blocks, about, 77, of, the, sun, s, uv, when, the, sun, is, highest, in, the, sky, at, zenith, with, absorption, increasing, at, shorter, uv, wavelengths, at, ground, level, with, the, sun, at, zenith, sunlight, is, 44, visible, light, 3, ultraviolet, and, the, remainder, infrared, of, the, ultraviolet, radiation, that, reaches, the, earth, s, surface, more, than, 95, is, the, longer, wavelengths, of, uva, with, the, small, remainder, uvb, almost, no, uvc, reaches, the, earth, s, surface, the, fraction, of, uva, and, uvb, which, remains, in, uv, radiation, after, passing, through, the, atmosphere, is, heavily, dependent, on, cloud, cover, and, atmospheric, conditions, on, partly, cloudy, days, patches, of, blue, sky, showing, between, clouds, are, also, sources, of, scattered, uva, and, uvb, which, are, produced, by, rayleigh, scattering, in, the, same, way, as, the, visible, blue, light, from, those, parts, of, the, sky, uvb, also, plays, a, major, role, in, plant, development, as, it, affects, most, of, the, plant, hormones, during, total, overcast, the, amount, of, absorption, due, to, clouds, is, heavily, dependent, on, the, thickness, of, the, clouds, and, latitude, with, no, clear, measurements, correlating, specific, thickness, and, absorption, of, uva, and, uvb, the, shorter, bands, of, uvc, as, well, as, even, more, energetic, uv, radiation, produced, by, the, sun, are, absorbed, by, oxygen, and, generate, the, ozone, in, the, ozone, layer, when, single, oxygen, atoms, produced, by, uv, photolysis, of, dioxygen, react, with, more, dioxygen, the, ozone, layer, is, especially, important, in, blocking, most, uvb, and, the, remaining, part, of, uvc, not, already, blocked, by, ordinary, oxygen, in, air, ultraviolet, absorbers, are, molecules, used, in, organic, materials, polymers, paints, etc, to, absorb, uv, radiation, to, reduce, the, uv, degradation, photo, oxidation, of, a, material, the, absorbers, can, themselves, degrade, over, time, so, monitoring, of, absorber, levels, in, weathered, materials, is, necessary, in, sunscreen, ingredients, that, absorb, uva, uvb, rays, such, as, avobenzone, oxybenzone, and, octyl, methoxycinnamate, are, organic, chemical, absorbers, or, blockers, they, are, contrasted, with, inorganic, absorbers, blockers, of, uv, radiation, such, as, carbon, black, titanium, dioxide, and, zinc, oxide, for, clothing, the, ultraviolet, protection, factor, upf, represents, the, ratio, of, sunburn, causing, uv, without, and, with, the, protection, of, the, fabric, similar, to, sun, protection, factor, spf, ratings, for, sunscreen, standard, summer, fabrics, have, upfs, around, 6, which, means, that, about, 20, of, uv, will, pass, through, suspended, nanoparticles, in, stained, glass, prevent, uv, rays, from, causing, chemical, reactions, that, change, image, colors, a, set, of, stained, glass, color, reference, chips, is, planned, to, be, used, to, calibrate, the, color, cameras, for, the, 2019, esa, mars, rover, mission, since, they, will, remain, unfaded, by, the, high, level, of, uv, present, at, the, surface, of, mars, common, soda, lime, glass, such, as, window, glass, is, partially, transparent, to, uva, but, is, opaque, to, shorter, wavelengths, passing, about, 90, of, the, light, above, 350, nm, but, blocking, over, 90, of, the, light, below, 300, nm, a, study, found, that, car, windows, allow, 3, 4, of, ambient, uv, to, pass, through, especially, if, the, uv, was, greater, than, 380, nm, other, types, of, car, windows, can, reduce, transmission, of, uv, that, is, greater, than, 335, nm, fused, quartz, depending, on, quality, can, be, transparent, even, to, vacuum, uv, wavelengths, crystalline, quartz, and, some, crystals, such, as, caf, 2, and, mgf, 2, transmit, well, down, to, 150, nm, or, 160, nm, wavelengths, wood, s, glass, is, a, deep, violet, blue, barium, sodium, silicate, glass, with, about, 9, nickel, oxide, developed, during, world, war, i, to, block, visible, light, for, covert, communications, it, allows, both, infrared, daylight, and, ultraviolet, night, time, communications, by, being, transparent, between, 320, nm, and, 400, nm, and, also, the, longer, infrared, and, just, barely, visible, red, wavelengths, its, maximum, uv, transmission, is, at, 365, nm, one, of, the, wavelengths, of, mercury, lamps, a, black, light, lamp, emits, long, wave, uva, radiation, and, little, visible, light, fluorescent, black, light, lamps, work, similarly, to, other, fluorescent, lamps, but, use, a, phosphor, on, the, inner, tube, surface, which, emits, uva, radiation, instead, of, visible, light, some, lamps, use, a, deep, bluish, purple, wood, s, glass, optical, filter, that, blocks, almost, all, visible, light, with, wavelengths, longer, than, 400, nanometers, the, purple, glow, given, off, by, these, tubes, is, not, the, ultraviolet, itself, but, visible, purple, light, from, mercury, s, 404, nm, spectral, line, which, escapes, being, filtered, out, by, the, coating, other, black, lights, use, plain, glass, instead, of, the, more, expensive, wood, s, glass, so, they, appear, light, blue, to, the, eye, when, operating, incandescent, black, lights, are, also, produced, using, a, filter, coating, on, the, envelope, of, an, incandescent, bulb, that, absorbs, visible, light, see, section, below, these, are, cheaper, but, very, inefficient, emitting, only, a, small, fraction, of, a, percent, of, their, power, as, uv, mercury, vapor, black, lights, in, ratings, up, to, 1, kw, with, uv, emitting, phosphor, and, an, envelope, of, wood, s, glass, are, used, for, theatrical, and, concert, displays, black, lights, are, used, in, applications, in, which, extraneous, visible, light, must, be, minimized, mainly, to, observe, fluorescence, the, colored, glow, that, many, substances, give, off, when, exposed, to, uv, light, uva, uvb, emitting, bulbs, are, also, sold, for, other, special, purposes, such, as, tanning, lamps, and, reptile, husbandry, shortwave, uv, lamps, are, made, using, a, fluorescent, lamp, tube, with, no, phosphor, coating, composed, of, fused, quartz, or, vycor, since, ordinary, glass, absorbs, uvc, these, lamps, emit, ultraviolet, light, with, two, peaks, in, the, uvc, band, at, 253, 7, nm, and, 185, nm, due, to, the, mercury, within, the, lamp, as, well, as, some, visible, light, from, 85, to, 90, of, the, uv, produced, by, these, lamps, is, at, 253, 7, nm, whereas, only, 5, 10, is, at, 185, nm, the, fused, quartz, tube, passes, the, 253, 7, nm, radiation, but, blocks, the, 185, nm, wavelength, such, tubes, have, two, or, three, times, the, uvc, power, of, a, regular, fluorescent, lamp, tube, these, low, pressure, lamps, have, a, typical, efficiency, of, approximately, 30, 40, meaning, that, for, every, 100, watts, of, electricity, consumed, by, the, lamp, they, will, produce, approximately, 30, 40, watts, of, total, uv, output, they, also, emit, bluish, white, visible, light, due, to, mercury, s, other, spectral, lines, these, germicidal, lamps, are, used, extensively, for, disinfection, of, surfaces, in, laboratories, and, food, processing, industries, and, for, disinfecting, water, supplies, black, light, incandescent, lamps, are, also, made, from, an, incandescent, light, bulb, with, a, filter, coating, which, absorbs, most, visible, light, halogen, lamps, with, fused, quartz, envelopes, are, used, as, inexpensive, uv, light, sources, in, the, near, uv, range, from, 400, to, 300, nm, in, some, scientific, instruments, due, to, its, black, body, spectrum, a, filament, light, bulb, is, a, very, inefficient, ultraviolet, source, emitting, only, a, fraction, of, a, percent, of, its, energy, as, uv, specialized, uv, gas, discharge, lamps, containing, different, gases, produce, uv, radiation, at, particular, spectral, lines, for, scientific, purposes, argon, and, deuterium, arc, lamps, are, often, used, as, stable, sources, either, windowless, or, with, various, windows, such, as, magnesium, fluoride, these, are, often, the, emitting, sources, in, uv, spectroscopy, equipment, for, chemical, analysis, other, uv, sources, with, more, continuous, emission, spectra, include, xenon, arc, lamps, commonly, used, as, sunlight, simulators, deuterium, arc, lamps, mercury, xenon, arc, lamps, and, metal, halide, arc, lamps, the, excimer, lamp, a, uv, source, developed, in, the, early, 2000s, is, seeing, increasing, use, in, scientific, fields, it, has, the, advantages, of, high, intensity, high, efficiency, and, operation, at, a, variety, of, wavelength, bands, into, the, vacuum, ultraviolet, light, emitting, diodes, leds, can, be, manufactured, to, emit, radiation, in, the, ultraviolet, range, in, 2019, following, significant, advances, over, the, preceding, five, years, uva, leds, of, 365, nm, and, longer, wavelength, were, available, with, efficiencies, of, 50, at, 1, 0, w, output, currently, the, most, common, types, of, uv, leds, are, in, 395, nm, and, 365, nm, wavelengths, both, of, which, are, in, the, uva, spectrum, the, rated, wavelength, is, the, peak, wavelength, that, the, leds, put, out, but, light, at, both, higher, and, lower, wavelengths, are, present, the, cheaper, and, more, common, 395, nm, uv, leds, are, much, closer, to, the, visible, spectrum, and, give, off, a, purple, color, other, uv, leds, deeper, into, the, spectrum, do, not, emit, as, much, visible, light, leds, are, used, for, applications, such, as, uv, curing, applications, charging, glow, in, the, dark, objects, such, as, paintings, or, toys, and, lights, for, detecting, counterfeit, money, and, bodily, fluids, uv, leds, are, also, used, in, digital, print, applications, and, inert, uv, curing, environments, power, densities, approaching, 3, w, cm, 2, 30, kw, m, 2, are, now, possible, and, this, coupled, with, recent, developments, by, photo, initiator, and, resin, formulators, makes, the, expansion, of, led, cured, uv, materials, likely, uvc, leds, are, developing, rapidly, but, may, require, testing, to, verify, effective, disinfection, citations, for, large, area, disinfection, are, for, non, led, uv, sources, known, as, germicidal, lamps, also, they, are, used, as, line, sources, to, replace, deuterium, lamps, in, liquid, chromatography, instruments, gas, lasers, laser, diodes, and, solid, state, lasers, can, be, manufactured, to, emit, ultraviolet, rays, and, lasers, are, available, that, cover, the, entire, uv, range, the, nitrogen, gas, laser, uses, electronic, excitation, of, nitrogen, molecules, to, emit, a, beam, that, is, mostly, uv, the, strongest, ultraviolet, lines, are, at, 337, 1, nm, and, 357, 6, nm, in, wavelength, another, type, of, high, power, gas, lasers, are, excimer, lasers, they, are, widely, used, lasers, emitting, in, ultraviolet, and, vacuum, ultraviolet, wavelength, ranges, presently, uv, argon, fluoride, excimer, lasers, operating, at, 193, nm, are, routinely, used, in, integrated, circuit, production, by, photolithography, the, current, wavelength, limit, of, production, of, coherent, uv, is, about, 126, nm, characteristic, of, the, ar, 2, excimer, laser, direct, uv, emitting, laser, diodes, are, available, at, 375, nm, uv, diode, pumped, solid, state, lasers, have, been, demonstrated, using, cerium, doped, lithium, strontium, aluminum, fluoride,

medicine, dermatology, and, keratectomy, chemistry, maldi, free, air, secure, communications, computing, optical, storage, and, manufacture, of, integrated, circuits, the, vacuum, ultraviolet, v, uv, band, 100, 200, nm, can, be, generated, by, non, linear, 4, wave, mixing, in, gases, by, sum, or, difference, frequency, mixing, of, 2, or, more, longer, wavelength, lasers, the, generation, is, generally, done, in, gasses, e, g, krypton, hydrogen, which, are, two, photon, resonant, near, 193, nm, or, metal, vapors, e, g, magnesium, by, making, one, of, the, lasers, tunable, the, v, uv, can, be, tuned, if, one, of, the, lasers, is, resonant, with, a, transition, in, the, gas, or, vapor, then, the, v, uv, production, is, intensified, however, resonances, also, generate, wavelength, dispersion, and, thus, the, phase, matching, can, limit, the, tunable, range, of, the, 4, wave, mixing, difference, frequency, mixing, i, e, f, 1, f, 2, f, 3, has, an, advantage, over, sum, frequency, mixing, because, the, phase, matching, can, provide, greater, tuning, in, particular, difference, frequency, mixing, two, photons, of, an, ar, f, 193, nm, excimer, laser, with, a, tunable, visible, or, near, ir, laser, in, hydrogen, or, krypton, provides, resonantly, enhanced, tunable, v, uv, covering, from, 100, nm, to, 200, nm, practically, the, lack, of, suitable, gas, vapor, cell, window, materials, above, the, lithium, fluoride, cut, off, wavelength, limit, the, tuning, range, to, longer, than, about, 110, nm, tunable, v, uv, wavelengths, down, to, 75, nm, was, achieved, using, window, free, configurations, lasers, have, been, used, to, indirectly, generate, non, coherent, extreme, uv, e, uv, radiation, at, 13, 5, nm, for, extreme, ultraviolet, lithography, the, e, uv, is, not, emitted, by, the, laser, but, rather, by, electron, transitions, in, an, extremely, hot, tin, or, xenon, plasma, which, is, excited, by, an, excimer, laser, this, technique, does, not, require, a, synchrotron, yet, can, produce, uv, at, the, edge, of, the, x, ray, spectrum, synchrotron, light, sources, can, also, produce, all, wavelengths, of, uv, including, those, at, the, boundary, of, the, uv, and, x, ray, spectra, at, 10, nm, the, impact, of, ultraviolet, radiation, on, human, health, has, implications, for, the, risks, and, benefits, of, sun, exposure, and, is, also, implicated, in, issues, such, as, fluorescent, lamps, and, health, getting, too, much, sun, exposure, can, be, harmful, but, in, moderation, sun, exposure, is, beneficial, uv, light, specifically, uvb, causes, the, body, to, produce, vitamin, d, which, is, essential, for, life, humans, need, some, uv, radiation, to, maintain, adequate, vitamin, d, levels, according, to, the, world, health, organization, there, is, no, doubt, that, a, little, sunlight, is, good, for, you, but, 5, 15, minutes, of, casual, sun, exposure, of, hands, face, and, arms, two, to, three, times, a, week, during, the, summer, months, is, sufficient, to, keep, your, vitamin, d, levels, high, vitamin, d, can, also, be, obtained, from, food, and, supplementation, excess, sun, exposure, produces, harmful, effects, however, vitamin, d, promotes, the, creation, of, serotonin, the, production, of, serotonin, is, in, direct, proportion, to, the, degree, of, bright, sunlight, the, body, receives, serotonin, is, thought, to, provide, sensations, of, happiness, well, being, and, serenity, to, human, beings, uv, rays, also, treat, certain, skin, conditions, modern, phototherapy, has, been, used, to, successfully, treat, psoriasis, eczema, jaundice, vitiligo, atopic, dermatitis, and, localized, scleroderma, in, addition, uv, light, in, particular, uvb, radiation, has, been, shown, to, induce, cell, cycle, arrest, in, keratinocytes, the, most, common, type, of, skin, cell, as, such, sunlight, therapy, can, be, a, candidate, for, treatment, of, conditions, such, as, psoriasis, and, exfoliative, cheilitis, conditions, in, which, skin, cells, divide, more, rapidly, than, usual, or, necessary, in, humans, excessive, exposure, to, uv, radiation, can, result, in, acute, and, chronic, harmful, effects, on, the, eye, s, dioptric, system, and, retina, the, risk, is, elevated, at, high, altitudes, and, people, living, in, high, latitude, areas, where, snow, covers, the, ground, right, into, early, summer, and, sun, positions, even, at, zenith, are, low, are, particularly, at, risk, skin, the, circadian, system, and, the, immune, system, can, also, be, affected, the, differential, effects, of, various, wavelengths, of, light, on, the, human, cornea, and, skin, are, sometimes, called, the, erythemal, action, spectrum, the, action, spectrum, shows, that, uva, does, not, cause, immediate, reaction, but, rather, uv, begins, to, cause, photokeratitis, and, skin, redness, with, lighter, skinned, individuals, being, more, sensitive, at, wavelengths, starting, near, the, beginning, of, the, uvb, band, at, 315, nm, and, rapidly, increasing, to, 300, nm, the, skin, and, eyes, are, most, sensitive, to, damage, by, uv, at, 265, 275, nm, which, is, in, the, lower, uvc, band, at, still, shorter, wavelengths, of, uv, damage, continues, to, happen, but, the, overt, effects, are, not, as, great, with, so, little, penetrating, the, atmosphere, the, who, standard, ultraviolet, index, is, a, widely, publicized, measurement, of, total, strength, of, uv, wavelengths, that, cause, sunburn, on, human, skin, by, weighting, uv, exposure, for, action, spectrum, effects, at, a, given, time, and, location, this, standard, shows, that, most, sunburn, happens, due, to, uv, at, wavelengths, near, the, boundary, of, the, uva, and, uvb, bands, overexposure, to, uvb, radiation, not, only, can, cause, sunburn, but, also, some, forms, of, skin, cancer, however, the, degree, of, redness, and, eye, irritation, which, are, largely, not, caused, by, uva, do, not, predict, the, long, term, effects, of, uv, although, they, do, mirror, the, direct, damage, of, dna, by, ultraviolet, all, bands, of, uv, radiation, damage, collagen, fibers, and, accelerate, aging, of, the, skin, both, uva, and, uvb, destroy, vitamin, a, in, skin, which, may, cause, further, damage, uvb, radiation, can, cause, direct, dna, damage, this, cancer, connection, is, one, reason, for, concern, about, ozone, depletion, and, the, ozone, hole, the, most, deadly, form, of, skin, cancer, malignant, melanoma, is, mostly, caused, by, dna, damage, independent, from, uva, radiation, this, can, be, seen, from, the, absence, of, a, direct, uv, signature, mutation, in, 92, of, all, melanoma, occasional, overexposure, and, sunburn, are, probably, greater, risk, factors, for, melanoma, than, long, term, moderate, exposure, uvc, is, the, highest, energy, most, dangerous, type, of, ultraviolet, radiation, and, causes, adverse, effects, that, can, variously, be, mutagenic, or, carcinogenic, in, the, past, uva, was, considered, not, harmful, or, less, harmful, than, uvb, but, today, it, is, known, to, contribute, to, skin, cancer, via, indirect, dna, damage, free, radicals, such, as, reactive, oxygen, species, uva, can, generate, highly, reactive, chemical, intermediates, such, as, hydroxyl, and, oxygen, radicals, which, in, turn, can, damage, dna, the, dna, damage, caused, indirectly, to, skin, by, uva, consists, mostly, of, single, strand, breaks, in, dna, while, the, damage, caused, by, uvb, includes, direct, formation, of, thymine, dimers, or, cytosine, dimers, and, double, strand, dna, breakage, uva, is, immunosuppressive, for, the, entire, body, accounting, for, a, large, part, of, the, immunosuppressive, effects, of, sunlight, exposure, and, is, mutagenic, for, basal, cell, keratinocytes, in, skin, uvb, photons, can, cause, direct, dna, damage, uvb, radiation, excites, dna, molecules, in, skin, cells, causing, aberrant, covalent, bonds, to, form, between, adjacent, pyrimidine, bases, producing, a, dimer, most, uv, induced, pyrimidine, dimers, in, dna, are, removed, by, the, process, known, as, nucleotide, excision, repair, that, employs, about, 30, different, proteins, those, pyrimidine, dimers, that, escape, this, repair, process, can, induce, a, form, of, programmed, cell, death, apoptosis, or, can, cause, dna, replication, errors, leading, to, mutation, as, a, defense, against, uv, radiation, the, amount, of, the, brown, pigment, melanin, in, the, skin, increases, when, exposed, to, moderate, depending, on, skin, type, levels, of, radiation, this, is, commonly, known, as, a, sun, tan, the, purpose, of, melanin, is, to, absorb, uv, radiation, and, dissipate, the, energy, as, harmless, heat, protecting, the, skin, against, both, direct, and, indirect, dna, damage, from, the, uv, uva, gives, a, quick, tan, that, lasts, for, days, by, oxidizing, melanin, that, was, already, present, and, triggers, the, release, of, the, melanin, from, melanocytes, uvb, yields, a, tan, that, takes, roughly, 2, days, to, develop, because, it, stimulates, the, body, to, produce, more, melanin, medical, organizations, recommend, that, patients, protect, themselves, from, uv, radiation, by, using, sunscreen, five, sunscreen, ingredients, have, been, shown, to, protect, mice, against, skin, tumors, however, some, sunscreen, chemicals, produce, potentially, harmful, substances, if, they, are, illuminated, while, in, contact, with, living, cells, the, amount, of, sunscreen, that, penetrates, into, the, lower, layers, of, the, skin, may, be, large, enough, to, cause, damage, sunscreen, reduces, the, direct, dna, damage, that, causes, sunburn, by, blocking, uvb, and, the, usual, spf, rating, indicates, how, effectively, this, radiation, is, blocked, spf, is, therefore, also, called, uvb, pf, for, uvb, protection, factor, this, rating, however, offers, no, data, about, important, protection, against, uva, which, does, not, primarily, cause, sunburn, but, is, still, harmful, since, it, causes, indirect, dna, damage, and, is, also, considered, carcinogenic, several, studies, suggest, that, the, absence, of, uva, filters, may, be, the, cause, of, the, higher, incidence, of, melanoma, found, in, sunscreen, users, compared, to, non, users, some, sunscreen, lotions, contain, titanium, dioxide, zinc, oxide, and, avobenzone, which, help, protect, against, uva, rays, the, photochemical, properties, of, melanin, make, it, an, excellent, photoprotectant, however, sunscreen, chemicals, cannot, dissipate, the, energy, of, the, excited, state, as, efficiently, as, melanin, and, therefore, if, sunscreen, ingredients, penetrate, into, the, lower, layers, of, the, skin, the, amount, of, reactive, oxygen, species, may, be, increased, the, amount, of, sunscreen, that, penetrates, through, the, stratum, corneum, may, or, may, not, be, large, enough, to, cause, damage, in, an, experiment, by, hanson, et, al, that, was, published, in, 2006, the, amount, of, harmful, reactive, oxygen, species, ros, was, measured, in, untreated, and, in, sunscreen, treated, skin, in, the, first, 20, minutes, the, film, of, sunscreen, had, a, protective, effect, and, the, number, of, ros, species, was, smaller, after, 60, minutes, however, the, amount, of, absorbed, sunscreen, was, so, high, that, the, amount, of, ros, was, higher, in, the, sunscreen, treated, skin, than, in, the, untreated, skin, the, study, indicates, that, sunscreen, must, be, reapplied, within, 2, hours, in, order, to, prevent, uv, light, from, penetrating, to, sunscreen, infused, live, skin, cells, ultraviolet, radiation, can, aggravate, several, skin, conditions, and, diseases, including, systemic, lupus, erythematosus, sj, gren, s, syndrome, sinear, usher, syndrome, rosacea, dermatomyositis, darier, s, disease, kindler, weary, syndrome, and, porokeratosis, the, eye, is, most, sensitive, to, damage, by, uv, in, the, lower, uvc, band, at, 265, 275, nm, radiation, of, this, wavelength, is, almost, absent, from, sunlight, at, the, surface, of, the, earth, but, is, emitted, by, artificial, sources, such, as, the, electrical, arcs, employed, in, arc, welding, unprotected, exposure, to, these, sources, can, cause, welder, s, flash, or, arc, eye, photokeratitis, and, can, lead, to, cataracts, pterygium, and, pinguecula, formation, to, a, lesser, extent, uvb, in, sunlight, from, 310, to, 280, nm, also, causes, photokeratitis, snow, blindness, and, the, cornea, the, lens, and, the, retina, can, be, damaged, protective, eyewear, is, beneficial, to, those, exposed, to, ultraviolet, radiation, since, light, can, reach, the, eyes, from, the, sides, full, coverage, eye, protection, is, usually, warranted, if, there, is, an, increased, risk, of, exposure, as, in, high, altitude, mountaineering, mountaineers, are, exposed, to, higher, than, ordinary, levels, of, uv, radiation, both, because, there, is, less, atmospheric, filtering, and, because, of, reflection, from, snow, and, ice, ordinary, untreated, eyeglasses, give, some, protection, most, plastic, lenses, give, more, protection, than, glass, lenses, because, as, noted, above, glass, is, transparent, to, uva, and, the, common, acrylic, plastic, used, for, lenses, is, less, so, some, plastic, lens, materials, such, as, polycarbonate, inherently, block, most, uv, uv, degradation, is, one, form, of, polymer, degradation, that, affects, plastics, exposed, to, sunlight, the, problem, appears, as, discoloration, or, fading, cracking, loss, of, strength, or, disintegration, the, effects, of, attack, increase, with, exposure, time, and, sunlight, intensity, the, addition, of, uv, absorbers, inhibits, the, effect, sensitive, polymers, include, thermoplastics, and, speciality, fibers, like, aramids, uv, absorption, leads, to, chain, degradation, and, loss, of, strength, at, sensitive, points, in, the, chain, structure, aramid, rope, must, be, shielded, with, a, sheath, of, thermoplastic, if, it, is, to, retain, its, strength, many, pigments, and, dyes, absorb, uv, and, change, colour, so, paintings, and, textiles, may, need, extra, protection, both, from, sunlight, and, fluorescent, lamps, two, common, sources, of, uv, radiation, window, glass, absorbs, some, harmful, uv, but, valuable, artifacts, need, extra, shielding, many, museums, place, black, curtains, over, watercolour, paintings, and, ancient, textiles, for, example, since, watercolours, can, have, very, low, pigment, levels, they, need, extra, protection, from, uv, various, forms, of, picture, framing, glass, including, acrylics, plexiglass, laminates, and, coatings, offer, different, degrees, of, uv, and, visible, light, protection, because, of, its, ability, to, cause, chemical, reactions, and, excite, fluorescence, in, materials, ultraviolet, radiation, has, a, number, of, applications, the, following, table, gives, some, uses, of, specific, wavelength, bands, in, the, uv, spectrum, photographic, film, responds, to, ultraviolet, radiation, but, the, glass, lenses, of, cameras, usually, block, radiation, shorter, than, 350, nm, slightly, yellow, uv, blocking, filters, are, often, used, for, outdoor, photography, to, prevent, unwanted, bluing, and, overexposure, by, uv, rays, for, photography, in, the, near, uv, special, filters, may, be, used, photography, with, wavelengths, shorter, than, 350, nm, requires, special, quartz, lenses, which, do, not, absorb, the, radiation, digital, cameras, sensors, may, have, internal, filters, that, block, uv, to, improve, color, rendition, accuracy, sometimes, these, internal, filters, can, be, removed, or, they, may, be, absent, and, an, external, visible, light, filter, prepares, the, camera, for, near, uv, photography, a, few, cameras, are, designed, for, use, in, the, uv, photography, by, reflected, ultraviolet, radiation, is, useful, for, medical, scientific, and, forensic, investigations, in, applications, as, widespread, as, detecting, bruising, of, skin, alterations, of, documents, or, restoration, work, on, paintings, photography, of, the, fluorescence, produced, by, ultraviolet, illumination, uses, visible, wavelengths, of, light, in, ultraviolet, astronomy, measurements, are, used, to, discern, the, chemical, composition, of, the, interstellar, medium, and, the, temperature, and, composition, of, stars, because, the, ozone, layer, blocks, many, uv, frequencies, from, reaching, telescopes, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, most, uv, observations, are, made, from, space, corona, discharge, on, electrical, apparatus, can, be, detected, by, its, ultraviolet, emissions, corona, causes, degradation, of, electrical, insulation, and, emission, of, ozone, and, nitrogen, oxide, eproms, erasable, programmable, read, only, memory, are, erased, by, exposure, to, uv, radiation, these, modules, have, a, transparent, quartz, window, on, the, top, of, the, chip, that, allows, the, uv, radiation, in, colorless, fluorescent, dyes, that, emit, blue, light, under, uv, are, added, as, optical, brighteners, to, paper, and, fabrics, the, blue, light, emitted, by, these, agents, counteracts, yellow, tints, that, may, be, present, and, causes, the, colors, and, whites, to, appear, whiter, or, more, brightly, colored, uv, fluorescent, dyes, that, glow, in, the, primary, colors, are, used, in, paints, papers, and, textiles, either, to, enhance, color, under, daylight, illumination, or, to, provide, special, effects, when, lit, with, uv, lamps, blacklight, paints, that, contain, dyes, that, glow, under, uv, are, used, in, a, number, of, art, and, aesthetic, applications, amusement, parks, often, use, uv, lighting, to, fluoresce, ride, artwork, and, backdrops, this, often, has, the, side, effect, of, causing, rider, s, white, clothing, to, glow, light, purple, to, help, prevent, counterfeiting, of, currency, or, forgery, of, important, documents, such, as, driver, s, licenses, and, passports, the, paper, may, include, a, uv, watermark, or, fluorescent, multicolor, fibers, that, are, visible, under, ultraviolet, light, postage, stamps, are, tagged, with, a, phosphor, that, glows, under, uv, rays, to, permit, automatic, detection, of, the, stamp, and, facing, of, the, letter, uv, fluorescent, dyes, are, used, in, many, applications, for, example, biochemistry, and, forensics, some, brands, of, pepper, spray, will, leave, an, invisible, chemical, uv, dye, that, is, not, easily, washed, off, on, a, pepper, sprayed, attacker, which, would, help, police, identify, the, attacker, later, in, some, types, of, nondestructive, testing, uv, stimulates, fluorescent, dyes, to, highlight, defects, in, a, broad, range, of, materials, these, dyes, may, be, carried, into, surface, breaking, defects, by, capillary, action, liquid, penetrant, inspection, or, they, may, be, bound, to, ferrite, particles, caught, in, magnetic, leakage, fields, in, ferrous, materials, magnetic, particle, inspection, uv, is, an, investigative, tool, at, the, crime, scene, helpful, in, locating, and, identifying, bodily, fluids, such, as, semen, blood, and, saliva, for, example, ejaculated, fluids, or, saliva, can, be, detected, by, high, power, uv, sources, irrespective, of, the, structure, or, colour, of, the, surface, the, fluid, is, deposited, upon, uv, vis, microspectroscopy, is, also, used, to, analyze, trace, evidence, such, as, textile, fibers, and, paint, chips, as, well, as, questioned, documents, other, applications, include, the, authentication, of, various, collectibles, and, art, and, detecting, counterfeit, currency, even, materials, not, specially, marked, with, uv, sensitive, dyes, may, have, distinctive, fluorescence, under, uv, exposure, or, may, fluoresce, differently, under, short, wave, versus, long, wave, ultraviolet, using, multi, spectral, imaging, it, is, possible, to, read, illegible, papyrus, such, as, the, burned, papyri, of, the, villa, of, the, papyri, or, of, oxyrhynchus, or, the, archimedes, palimpsest, the, technique, involves, taking, pictures, of, the, illegible, document, using, different, filters, in, the, infrared, or, ultraviolet, range, finely, tuned, to, capture, certain, wavelengths, of, light, thus, the, optimum, spectral, portion, can, be, found, for, distinguishing, ink, from, paper, on, the, papyrus, surface, simple, nuv, sources, can, be, used, to, highlight, faded, iron, based, ink, on, vellum, ultraviolet, helps, detect, organic, material, deposits, that, remain, on, surfaces, where, periodic, cleaning, and, sanitizing, may, have, failed, it, is, used, in, the, hotel, industry, manufacturing, and, other, industries, where, levels, of, cleanliness, or, contamination, are, inspected, perennial, news, features, for, many, television, news, organizations, involve, an, investigative, reporter, using, a, similar, device, to, reveal, unsanitary, conditions, in, hotels, public, toilets, hand, rails, and, such, uv, vis, spectroscopy, is, widely, used, as, a, technique, in, chemistry, to, analyze, chemical, structure, the, most, notable, one, being, conjugated, systems, uv, radiation, is, often, used, to, excite, a, given, sample, where, the, fluorescent, emission, is, measured, with, a, spectrofluorometer, in, biological, research, uv, radiation, is, used, for, quantification, of, nucleic, acids, or, proteins, in, environmental, chemistry, uv, radiation, could, also, be, used, to, detect, contaminants, of, emerging, concern, in, water, samples, in, pollution, control, applications, ultraviolet, analyzers, are, used, to, detect, emissions, of, nitrogen, oxides, sulfur, compounds, mercury, and, ammonia, for, example, in, the, flue, gas, of, fossil, fired, power, plants, ultraviolet, radiation, can, detect, thin, sheens, of, spilled, oil, on, water, either, by, the, high, reflectivity, of, oil, films, at, uv, wavelengths, fluorescence, of, compounds, in, oil, or, by, absorbing, of, uv, created, by, raman, scattering, in, water, uv, absorbance, can, also, be, uesd, to, quantify, contaminants, in, wastewater, most, commonly, used, 254, nm, uv, absorbance, is, genrally, used, as, a, surrogate, parameters, to, quantify, nom, another, form, of, light, based, detection, method, uses, a, wide, spectrum, of, excitation, emission, matrix, eem, to, detect, and, identify, contaminants, based, on, their, flourense, properties, eem, could, be, used, to, discriminate, different, groups, of, nom, based, on, the, difference, in, light, emission, and, excitation, of, fluorophores, noms, with, certain, molecular, structures, are, reported, to, have, fluorescent, properties, in, a, wide, range, of, excitation, emission, wavelengths, ultraviolet, lamps, are, also, used, as, part, of, the, analysis, of, some, minerals, and, gems, in, general, ultraviolet, detectors, use, either, a, solid, state, device, such, as, one, based, on, silicon, carbide, or, aluminium, nitride, or, a, gas, filled, tube, as, the, sensing, element, uv, detectors, that, are, sensitive, to, uv, in, any, part, of, the, spectrum, respond, to, irradiation, by, sunlight, and, artificial, light, a, burning, hydrogen, flame, for, instance, radiates, strongly, in, the, 185, to, 260, nanometer, range, and, only, very, weakly, in, the, ir, region, whereas, a, coal, fire, emits, very, weakly, in, the, uv, band, yet, very, strongly, at, ir, wavelengths, thus, a, fire, detector, that, operates, using, both, uv, and, ir, detectors, is, more, reliable, than, one, with, a, uv, detector, alone, virtually, all, fires, emit, some, radiation, in, the, uvc, band, whereas, the, sun, s, radiation, at, this, band, is, absorbed, by, the, earth, s, atmosphere, the, result, is, that, the, uv, detector, is, solar, blind, meaning, it, will, not, cause, an, alarm, in, response, to, radiation, from, the, sun, so, it, can, easily, be, used, both, indoors, and, outdoors, uv, detectors, are, sensitive, to, most, fires, including, hydrocarbons, metals, sulfur, hydrogen, hydrazine, and, ammonia, arc, welding, electrical, arcs, lightning, x, rays, used, in, nondestructive, metal, testing, equipment, though, this, is, highly, unlikely, and, radioactive, materials, can, produce, levels, that, will, activate, a, uv, detection, system, the, presence, of, uv, absorbing, gases, and, vapors, will, attenuate, the, uv, radiation, from, a, fire, adversely, affecting, the, ability, of, the, detector, to, detect, flames, likewise, the, presence, of, an, oil, mist, in, the, air, or, an, oil, film, on, the, detector, window, will, have, the, same, effect, ultraviolet, radiation, is, used, for, very, fine, resolution, photolithography, a, procedure, wherein, a, chemical, called, a, photoresist, is, exposed, to, uv, radiation, that, has, passed, through, a, mask, the, exposure, causes, chemical, reactions, to, occur, in, the, photoresist, after, removal, of, unwanted, photoresist, a, pattern, determined, by, the, mask, remains, on, the, sample, steps, may, then, be, taken, to, etch, away, deposit, on, or, otherwise, modify, areas, of, the, sample, where, no, photoresist, remains, photolithography, is, used, in, the, manufacture, of, semiconductors, integrated, circuit, components, and, printed, circuit, boards, photolithography, processes, used, to, fabricate, electronic, integrated, circuits, presently, use, 193, nm, uv, and, are, experimentally, using, 13, 5, nm, uv, for, extreme, ultraviolet, lithography, electronic, components, that, require, clear, transparency, for, light, to, exit, or, enter, photovoltaic, panels, and, sensors, can, be, potted, using, acrylic, resins, that, are, cured, using, uv, energy, the, advantages, are, low, voc, emissions, and, rapid, curing, certain, inks, coatings, and, adhesives, are, formulated, with, photoinitiators, and, resins, when, exposed, to, uv, light, polymerization, occurs, and, so, the, adhesives, harden, or, cure, usually, within, a, few, seconds, applications, include, glass, and, plastic, bonding, optical, fiber, coatings, the, coating, of, flooring, uv, coating, and, paper, finishes, in, offset, printing, dental, fillings, and, decorative, fingernail, gels, uv, sources, for, uv, curing, applications, include, uv, lamps, uv, leds, and, excimer, flash, lamps, fast, processes, such, as, flexo, or, offset, printing, require, high, intensity, light, focused, via, reflectors, onto, a, moving, substrate, and, medium, so, high, pressure, hg, mercury, or, fe, iron, doped, based, bulbs, are, used, energized, with, electric, arcs, or, microwaves, lower, power, fluorescent, lamps, and, leds, can, be, used, for, static, applications, small, high, pressure, lamps, can, have, light, focused, and, transmitted, to, the, work, area, via, liquid, filled, or, fiber, optic, light, guides, the, impact, of, uv, on, polymers, is, used, for, modification, of, the, roughness, and, hydrophobicity, of, polymer, surfaces, for, example, a, poly, methyl, methacrylate, surface, can, be, smoothed, by, vacuum, ultraviolet, uv, radiation, is, useful, in, preparing, low, surface, energy, polymers, for, adhesives, polymers, exposed, to, uv, will, oxidize, thus, raising, the, surface, energy, of, the, polymer, once, the, surface, energy, of, the, polymer, has, been, raised, the, bond, between, the, adhesive, and, the, polymer, is, stronger, using, a, catalytic, chemical, reaction, from, titanium, dioxide, and, uvc, exposure, oxidation, of, organic, matter, converts, pathogens, pollens, and, mold, spores, into, harmless, inert, byproducts, however, the, reaction, of, titanium, dioxide, and, uvc, is, not, a, straight, path, several, hundreds, of, reactions, occur, prior, to, the, inert, byproducts, stage, and, can, hinder, the, resulting, reaction, creating, formaldehyde, aldehyde, and, other, voc, s, en, route, to, a, final, stage, thus, the, use, of, titanium, dioxide, and, uvc, requires, very, specific, parameters, for, a, successful, outcome, the, cleansing, mechanism, of, uv, is, a, photochemical, process, contaminants, in, the, indoor, environment, are, almost, entirely, organic, carbon, based, compounds, which, break, down, when, exposed, to, high, intensity, uv, at, 240, to, 280, nm, short, wave, ultraviolet, radiation, can, destroy, dna, in, living, microorganisms, uvc, s, effectiveness, is, directly, related, to, intensity, and, exposure, time, uv, has, also, been, shown, to, reduce, gaseous, contaminants, such, as, carbon, monoxide, and, vocs, uv, lamps, radiating, at, 184, and, 254, nm, can, remove, low, concentrations, of, hydrocarbons, and, carbon, monoxide, if, the, air, is, recycled, between, the, room, and, the, lamp, chamber, this, arrangement, prevents, the, introduction, of, ozone, into, the, treated, air, likewise, air, may, be, treated, by, passing, by, a, single, uv, source, operating, at, 184, nm, and, passed, over, iron, pentaoxide, to, remove, the, ozone, produced, by, the, uv, lamp, ultraviolet, lamps, are, used, to, sterilize, workspaces, and, tools, used, in, biology, laboratories, and, medical, facilities, commercially, available, low, pressure, mercury, vapor, lamps, emit, about, 86, of, their, radiation, at, 254, nanometers, nm, with, 265, nm, being, the, peak, germicidal, effectiveness, curve, uv, at, these, germicidal, wavelengths, damage, a, microorganism, s, dna, rna, so, that, it, cannot, reproduce, making, it, harmless, even, though, the, organism, may, not, be, killed, since, microorganisms, can, be, shielded, from, ultraviolet, rays, in, small, cracks, and, other, shaded, areas, these, lamps, are, used, only, as, a, supplement, to, other, sterilization, techniques, uvc, leds, are, relatively, new, to, the, commercial, market, and, are, gaining, in, popularity, due, to, their, monochromatic, nature, 5, nm, these, leds, can, target, a, specific, wavelength, needed, for, disinfection, this, is, especially, important, knowing, that, pathogens, vary, in, their, sensitivity, to, specific, uv, wavelengths, leds, are, mercury, free, instant, on, off, and, have, unlimited, cycling, throughout, the, day, disinfection, using, uv, radiation, is, commonly, used, in, wastewater, treatment, applications, and, is, finding, an, increased, usage, in, municipal, drinking, water, treatment, many, bottlers, of, spring, water, use, uv, disinfection, equipment, to, sterilize, their, water, solar, water, disinfection, has, been, researched, for, cheaply, treating, contaminated, water, using, natural, sunlight, the, uva, irradiation, and, increased, water, temperature, kill, organisms, in, the, water, ultraviolet, radiation, is, used, in, several, food, processes, to, kill, unwanted, microorganisms, uv, can, be, used, to, pasteurize, fruit, juices, by, flowing, the, juice, over, a, high, intensity, ultraviolet, source, the, effectiveness, of, such, a, process, depends, on, the, uv, absorbance, of, the, juice, pulsed, light, pl, is, a, technique, of, killing, microorganisms, on, surfaces, using, pulses, of, an, intense, broad, spectrum, rich, in, uvc, between, 200, and, 280, nm, pulsed, light, works, with, xenon, flash, lamps, that, can, produce, flashes, several, times, per, second, disinfection, robots, use, pulsed, uv, the, antimicrobial, effectiveness, of, filtered, far, uvc, 222, nm, light, on, a, range, of, pathogens, including, bacteria, and, fungi, showed, inhibition, of, pathogen, growth, and, since, it, has, lesser, harmful, effects, it, provides, essential, insights, for, reliable, disinfection, in, healthcare, settings, such, as, hospitals, and, long, term, care, homes, uvc, has, also, been, shown, to, be, effective, at, degrading, sars, cov, 2, virus, some, animals, including, birds, reptiles, and, insects, such, as, bees, can, see, near, ultraviolet, wavelengths, many, fruits, flowers, and, seeds, stand, out, more, strongly, from, the, background, in, ultraviolet, wavelengths, as, compared, to, human, color, vision, scorpions, glow, or, take, on, a, yellow, to, green, color, under, uv, illumination, thus, assisting, in, the, control, of, these, arachnids, many, birds, have, patterns, in, their, plumage, that, are, invisible, at, usual, wavelengths, but, observable, in, ultraviolet, and, the, urine, and, other, secretions, of, some, animals, including, dogs, cats, and, human, beings, are, much, easier, to, spot, with, ultraviolet, urine, trails, of, rodents, can, be, detected, by, pest, control, technicians, for, proper, treatment, of, infested, dwellings, butterflies, use, ultraviolet, as, a, communication, system, for, sex, recognition, and, mating, behavior, for, example, in, the, colias, eurytheme, butterfly, males, rely, on, visual, cues, to, locate, and, identify, females, instead, of, using, chemical, stimuli, to, find, mates, males, are, attracted, to, the, ultraviolet, reflecting, color, of, female, hind, wings, in, pieris, napi, butterflies, it, was, shown, that, females, in, northern, finland, with, less, uv, radiation, present, in, the, environment, possessed, stronger, uv, signals, to, attract, their, males, than, those, occurring, further, south, this, suggested, that, it, was, evolutionarily, more, difficult, to, increase, the, uv, sensitivity, of, the, eyes, of, the, males, than, to, increase, the, uv, signals, emitted, by, the, females, many, insects, use, the, ultraviolet, wavelength, emissions, from, celestial, objects, as, references, for, flight, navigation, a, local, ultraviolet, emitter, will, normally, disrupt, the, navigation, process, and, will, eventually, attract, the, flying, insect, the, green, fluorescent, protein, gfp, is, often, used, in, genetics, as, a, marker, many, substances, such, as, proteins, have, significant, light, absorption, bands, in, the, ultraviolet, that, are, of, interest, in, biochemistry, and, related, fields, uv, capable, spectrophotometers, are, common, in, such, laboratories, ultraviolet, traps, called, bug, zappers, are, used, to, eliminate, various, small, flying, insects, they, are, attracted, to, the, uv, and, are, killed, using, an, electric, shock, or, trapped, once, they, come, into, contact, with, the, device, different, designs, of, ultraviolet, radiation, traps, are, also, used, by, entomologists, for, collecting, nocturnal, insects, during, faunistic, survey, studies, ultraviolet, radiation, is, helpful, in, the, treatment, of, skin, conditions, such, as, psoriasis, and, vitiligo, exposure, to, uva, while, the, skin, is, hyper, photosensitive, by, taking, psoralens, is, an, effective, treatment, for, psoriasis, due, to, the, potential, of, psoralens, to, cause, damage, to, the, liver, puva, therapy, may, be, used, only, a, limited, number, of, times, over, a, patient, s, lifetime, uvb, phototherapy, does, not, require, additional, medications, or, topical, preparations, for, the, therapeutic, benefit, only, the, exposure, is, needed, however, phototherapy, can, be, effective, when, used, in, conjunction, with, certain, topical, treatments, such, as, anthralin, coal, tar, and, vitamin, a, and, d, derivatives, or, systemic, treatments, such, as, methotrexate, and, soriatane, reptiles, need, uvb, for, biosynthesis, of, vitamin, d, and, other, metabolic, processes, specifically, cholecalciferol, vitamin, d3, which, is, needed, for, basic, cellular, neural, functioning, as, well, as, the, utilization, of, calcium, for, bone, and, egg, production, the, uva, wavelength, is, also, visible, to, many, reptiles, and, might, play, a, significant, role, in, their, ability, survive, in, the, wild, as, well, as, in, visual, communication, between, individuals, therefore, in, a, typical, reptile, enclosure, a, fluorescent, uv, a, b, source, at, the, proper, strength, spectrum, for, the, species, must, be, available, for, many, captive, species, to, survive, simple, supplementation, with, cholecalciferol, vitamin, d3, will, not, be, enough, as, there, s, a, complete, biosynthetic, pathway, that, is, leapfrogged, risks, of, possible, overdoses, the, intermediate, molecules, and, metabolites, also, play, important, functions, in, the, animals, health, natural, sunlight, in, the, right, levels, is, always, going, to, be, superior, to, artificial, sources, but, this, might, not, be, possible, for, keepers, in, different, parts, of, the, world, it, is, a, known, problem, that, high, levels, of, output, of, the, uva, part, of, the, spectrum, can, both, cause, cellular, and, dna, damage, to, sensitive, parts, of, their, bodies, especially, the, eyes, where, blindness, is, the, result, of, an, improper, uva, b, source, use, and, placement, photokeratitis, for, many, keepers, there, must, also, be, a, provision, for, an, adequate, heat, source, this, has, resulted, in, the, marketing, of, heat, and, light, combination, products, keepers, should, be, careful, of, these, combination, light, heat, and, uva, b, generators, they, typically, emit, high, levels, of, uva, with, lower, levels, of, uvb, that, are, set, and, difficult, to, control, so, that, animals, can, have, their, needs, met, a, better, strategy, is, to, use, individual, sources, of, these, elements, and, so, they, can, be, placed, and, controlled, by, the, keepers, for, the, max, benefit, of, the, animals, the, evolution, of, early, reproductive, proteins, and, enzymes, is, attributed, in, modern, models, of, evolutionary, theory, to, ultraviolet, radiation, uvb, causes, thymine, base, pairs, next, to, each, other, in, genetic, sequences, to, bond, together, into, thymine, dimers, a, disruption, in, the, strand, that, reproductive, enzymes, cannot, copy, this, leads, to, frameshifting, during, genetic, replication, and, protein, synthesis, usually, killing, the, cell, before, formation, of, the, uv, blocking, ozone, layer, when, early, prokaryotes, approached, the, surface, of, the, ocean, they, almost, invariably, died, out, the, few, that, survived, had, developed, enzymes, that, monitored, the, genetic, material, and, removed, thymine, dimers, by, nucleotide, excision, repair, enzymes, many, enzymes, and, proteins, involved, in, modern, mitosis, and, meiosis, are, similar, to, repair, enzymes, and, are, believed, to, be, evolved, modifications, of, the, enzymes, originally, used, to, overcome, dna, damages, caused, by, uv, photobiology, is, the, scientific, study, of, the, beneficial, and, harmful, interactions, of, non, ionizing, radiation, in, living, organisms, conventionally, demarcated, around, 10, ev, the, first, ionization, energy, of, oxygen, uv, ranges, roughly, from, 3, to, 30, ev, in, energy, hence, photobiology, entertains, some, but, not, all, of, the, uv, spectrum
