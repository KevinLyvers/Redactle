the, steradian, symbol, sr, or, square, radian, is, the, unit, of, solid, angle, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, it, is, used, in, three, dimensional, geometry, and, is, analogous, to, the, radian, which, quantifies, planar, angles, a, solid, angle, in, steradians, projected, onto, a, sphere, gives, the, area, of, a, spherical, cap, on, the, surface, whereas, an, angle, in, radians, projected, onto, a, circle, gives, a, length, of, a, circular, arc, on, the, circumference, the, name, is, derived, from, the, greek, stereos, solid, radian, the, steradian, is, a, dimensionless, unit, the, quotient, of, the, area, subtended, and, the, square, of, its, distance, from, the, centre, both, the, numerator, and, denominator, of, this, ratio, have, dimension, length, squared, i, e, l, 2, l, 2, 1, dimensionless, it, is, useful, however, to, distinguish, between, dimensionless, quantities, of, a, different, kind, such, as, the, radian, a, ratio, of, quantities, of, dimension, length, so, the, symbol, sr, is, used, to, indicate, a, solid, angle, for, example, radiant, intensity, can, be, measured, in, watts, per, steradian, w, sr, 1, the, steradian, was, formerly, an, si, supplementary, unit, but, this, category, was, abolished, in, 1995, and, the, steradian, is, now, considered, an, si, derived, unit, a, steradian, can, be, defined, as, the, solid, angle, subtended, at, the, centre, of, a, unit, sphere, by, a, unit, area, on, its, surface, for, a, general, sphere, of, radius, r, any, portion, of, its, surface, with, area, a, r, 2, subtends, one, steradian, at, its, centre, the, solid, angle, is, related, to, the, area, it, cuts, out, of, a, sphere, where, because, the, surface, area, a, of, a, sphere, is, 4, r, 2, the, definition, implies, that, a, sphere, subtends, 4, steradians, 12, 56637, sr, at, its, centre, or, that, a, steradian, subtends, 1, 4, 0, 07958, of, a, sphere, by, the, same, argument, the, maximum, solid, angle, that, can, be, subtended, at, any, point, is, 4, sr, the, area, of, a, spherical, cap, is, a, 2, rh, where, h, is, the, height, of, the, cap, if, a, r, 2, then, h, r, 1, 2, displaystyle, tfrac, h, r, tfrac, 1, 2, pi, from, this, one, can, compute, the, plane, aperture, angle, 2, of, the, cross, section, of, a, simple, cone, whose, solid, angle, equals, one, steradian, giving, 0, 572, rad, or, 32, 77, and, 2, 1, 144, rad, or, 65, 54, the, solid, angle, of, a, simple, cone, whose, cross, section, subtends, the, angle, 2, is, a, steradian, is, also, equal, to, 1, 4, displaystyle, tfrac, 1, 4, pi, of, a, complete, sphere, spat, to, 360, 2, 2, displaystyle, left, tfrac, 360, circ, 2, pi, right, 2, 3282, 80635, square, degrees, and, to, the, spherical, area, of, a, polygon, having, an, angle, excess, of, 1, radian, millisteradians, msr, and, microsteradians, sr, are, occasionally, used, to, describe, light, and, particle, beams, other, multiples, are, rarely, used
