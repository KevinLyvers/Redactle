extratropical, cyclones, sometimes, called, mid, latitude, cyclones, or, wave, cyclones, are, low, pressure, areas, which, along, with, the, anticyclones, of, high, pressure, areas, drive, the, weather, over, much, of, the, earth, extratropical, cyclones, are, capable, of, producing, anything, from, cloudiness, and, mild, showers, to, severe, gales, thunderstorms, blizzards, and, tornadoes, these, types, of, cyclones, are, defined, as, large, scale, synoptic, low, pressure, weather, systems, that, occur, in, the, middle, latitudes, of, the, earth, in, contrast, with, tropical, cyclones, extratropical, cyclones, produce, rapid, changes, in, temperature, and, dew, point, along, broad, lines, called, weather, fronts, about, the, center, of, the, cyclone, the, term, cyclone, applies, to, numerous, types, of, low, pressure, areas, one, of, which, is, the, extratropical, cyclone, the, descriptor, extratropical, signifies, that, this, type, of, cyclone, generally, occurs, outside, the, tropics, and, in, the, middle, latitudes, of, earth, between, 30, and, 60, latitude, they, are, termed, mid, latitude, cyclones, if, they, form, within, those, latitudes, or, post, tropical, cyclones, if, a, tropical, cyclone, has, intruded, into, the, mid, latitudes, weather, forecasters, and, the, general, public, often, describe, them, simply, as, depressions, or, lows, terms, like, frontal, cyclone, frontal, depression, frontal, low, extratropical, low, non, tropical, low, and, hybrid, low, are, often, used, as, well, extratropical, cyclones, are, classified, mainly, as, baroclinic, because, they, form, along, zones, of, temperature, and, dewpoint, gradient, known, as, frontal, zones, they, can, become, barotropic, late, in, their, life, cycle, when, the, distribution, of, heat, around, the, cyclone, becomes, fairly, uniform, with, its, radius, extratropical, cyclones, form, anywhere, within, the, extratropical, regions, of, the, earth, usually, between, 30, and, 60, latitude, from, the, equator, either, through, cyclogenesis, or, extratropical, transition, in, a, climatology, study, with, two, different, cyclone, algorithms, a, total, of, 49, 745, 72, 931, extratropical, cyclones, in, the, northern, hemisphere, and, 71, 289, 74, 229, extratropical, cyclones, in, the, southern, hemisphere, were, detected, between, 1979, and, 2018, based, on, reanalysis, data, a, study, of, extratropical, cyclones, in, the, southern, hemisphere, shows, that, between, the, 30th, and, 70th, parallels, there, are, an, average, of, 37, cyclones, in, existence, during, any, 6, hour, period, a, separate, study, in, the, northern, hemisphere, suggests, that, approximately, 234, significant, extratropical, cyclones, form, each, winter, extratropical, cyclones, form, along, linear, bands, of, temperature, dew, point, gradient, with, significant, vertical, wind, shear, and, are, thus, classified, as, baroclinic, cyclones, initially, cyclogenesis, or, low, pressure, formation, occurs, along, frontal, zones, near, a, favorable, quadrant, of, a, maximum, in, the, upper, level, jetstream, known, as, a, jet, streak, the, favorable, quadrants, are, usually, at, the, right, rear, and, left, front, quadrants, where, divergence, ensues, the, divergence, causes, air, to, rush, out, from, the, top, of, the, air, column, as, mass, in, the, column, is, reduced, atmospheric, pressure, at, surface, level, the, weight, of, the, air, column, is, reduced, the, lowered, pressure, strengthens, the, cyclone, a, low, pressure, system, the, lowered, pressure, acts, to, draw, in, air, creating, convergence, in, the, low, level, wind, field, low, level, convergence, and, upper, level, divergence, imply, upward, motion, within, the, column, making, cyclones, cloudy, as, the, cyclone, strengthens, the, cold, front, sweeps, towards, the, equator, and, moves, around, the, back, of, the, cyclone, meanwhile, its, associated, warm, front, progresses, more, slowly, as, the, cooler, air, ahead, of, the, system, is, denser, and, therefore, more, difficult, to, dislodge, later, the, cyclones, occlude, as, the, poleward, portion, of, the, cold, front, overtakes, a, section, of, the, warm, front, forcing, a, tongue, or, trowal, of, warm, air, aloft, eventually, the, cyclone, will, become, barotropically, cold, and, begin, to, weaken, atmospheric, pressure, can, fall, very, rapidly, when, there, are, strong, upper, level, forces, on, the, system, when, pressures, fall, more, than, 1, millibar, 0, 030, inhg, per, hour, the, process, is, called, explosive, cyclogenesis, and, the, cyclone, can, be, described, as, a, bomb, these, bombs, rapidly, drop, in, pressure, to, below, 980, millibars, 28, 94, inhg, under, favorable, conditions, such, as, near, a, natural, temperature, gradient, like, the, gulf, stream, or, at, a, preferred, quadrant, of, an, upper, level, jet, streak, where, upper, level, divergence, is, best, the, stronger, the, upper, level, divergence, over, the, cyclone, the, deeper, the, cyclone, can, become, hurricane, force, extratropical, cyclones, are, most, likely, to, form, in, the, northern, atlantic, and, northern, pacific, oceans, in, the, months, of, december, and, january, on, 14, and, 15, december, 1986, an, extratropical, cyclone, near, iceland, deepened, to, below, 920, millibars, 27, inhg, which, is, a, pressure, equivalent, to, a, category, 5, hurricane, in, the, arctic, the, average, pressure, for, cyclones, is, 980, millibars, 28, 94, inhg, during, the, winter, and, 1, 000, millibars, 29, 53, inhg, during, the, summer, tropical, cyclones, often, transform, into, extratropical, cyclones, at, the, end, of, their, tropical, existence, usually, between, 30, and, 40, latitude, where, there, is, sufficient, forcing, from, upper, level, troughs, or, shortwaves, riding, the, westerlies, for, the, process, of, extratropical, transition, to, begin, during, this, process, a, cyclone, in, extratropical, transition, known, across, the, eastern, north, pacific, and, north, atlantic, oceans, as, the, post, tropical, stage, will, invariably, form, or, connect, with, nearby, fronts, and, or, troughs, consistent, with, a, baroclinic, system, due, to, this, the, size, of, the, system, will, usually, appear, to, increase, while, the, core, weakens, however, after, transition, is, complete, the, storm, may, re, strengthen, due, to, baroclinic, energy, depending, on, the, environmental, conditions, surrounding, the, system, the, cyclone, will, also, distort, in, shape, becoming, less, symmetric, with, time, during, extratropical, transition, the, cyclone, begins, to, tilt, back, into, the, colder, airmass, with, height, and, the, cyclone, s, primary, energy, source, converts, from, the, release, of, latent, heat, from, condensation, from, thunderstorms, near, the, center, to, baroclinic, processes, the, low, pressure, system, eventually, loses, its, warm, core, and, becomes, a, cold, core, system, the, peak, time, of, subtropical, cyclogenesis, the, midpoint, of, this, transition, in, the, north, atlantic, is, in, the, months, of, september, and, october, when, the, difference, between, the, temperature, of, the, air, aloft, and, the, sea, surface, temperature, is, the, greatest, leading, to, the, greatest, potential, for, instability, on, rare, occasions, an, extratropical, cyclone, can, transform, into, a, tropical, cyclone, if, it, reaches, an, area, of, ocean, with, warmer, waters, and, an, environment, with, less, vertical, wind, shear, an, example, of, this, happening, is, in, the, 1991, perfect, storm, the, process, known, as, tropical, transition, involves, the, usually, slow, development, of, an, extratropically, cold, core, vortex, into, a, tropical, cyclone, the, joint, typhoon, warning, center, uses, the, extratropical, transition, xt, technique, to, subjectively, estimate, the, intensity, of, tropical, cyclones, becoming, extratropical, based, on, visible, and, infrared, satellite, imagery, loss, of, central, convection, in, transitioning, tropical, cyclones, can, cause, the, dvorak, technique, to, fail, the, loss, of, convection, results, in, unrealistically, low, estimates, using, the, dvorak, technique, the, system, combines, aspects, of, the, dvorak, technique, used, for, estimating, tropical, cyclone, intensity, and, the, hebert, poteat, technique, used, for, estimating, subtropical, cyclone, intensity, the, technique, is, applied, when, a, tropical, cyclone, interacts, with, a, frontal, boundary, or, loses, its, central, convection, while, maintaining, its, forward, speed, or, accelerating, the, xt, scale, corresponds, to, the, dvorak, scale, and, is, applied, in, the, same, way, except, that, xt, is, used, instead, of, t, to, indicate, that, the, system, is, undergoing, extratropical, transition, also, the, xt, technique, is, only, used, once, extratropical, transition, begins, the, dvorak, technique, is, still, used, if, the, system, begins, dissipating, without, transition, once, the, cyclone, has, completed, transition, and, become, cold, core, the, technique, is, no, longer, used, the, windfield, of, an, extratropical, cyclone, constricts, with, distance, in, relation, to, surface, level, pressure, with, the, lowest, pressure, being, found, near, the, center, and, the, highest, winds, typically, just, on, the, cold, poleward, side, of, warm, fronts, occlusions, and, cold, fronts, where, the, pressure, gradient, force, is, highest, the, area, poleward, and, west, of, the, cold, and, warm, fronts, connected, to, extratropical, cyclones, is, known, as, the, cold, sector, while, the, area, equatorward, and, east, of, its, associated, cold, and, warm, fronts, is, known, as, the, warm, sector, the, wind, flow, around, an, extratropical, cyclone, is, counterclockwise, in, the, northern, hemisphere, and, clockwise, in, the, southern, hemisphere, due, to, the, coriolis, effect, this, manner, of, rotation, is, generally, referred, to, as, cyclonic, near, this, center, the, pressure, gradient, force, from, the, pressure, at, the, center, of, the, cyclone, compared, to, the, pressure, outside, the, cyclone, and, the, coriolis, force, must, be, in, an, approximate, balance, for, the, cyclone, to, avoid, collapsing, in, on, itself, as, a, result, of, the, difference, in, pressure, the, central, pressure, of, the, cyclone, will, lower, with, increasing, maturity, while, outside, of, the, cyclone, the, sea, level, pressure, is, about, average, in, most, extratropical, cyclones, the, part, of, the, cold, front, ahead, of, the, cyclone, will, develop, into, a, warm, front, giving, the, frontal, zone, as, drawn, on, surface, weather, maps, a, wave, like, shape, due, to, their, appearance, on, satellite, images, extratropical, cyclones, can, also, be, referred, to, as, frontal, waves, early, in, their, life, cycle, in, the, united, states, an, old, name, for, such, a, system, is, warm, wave, in, the, northern, hemisphere, once, a, cyclone, occludes, a, tr, ough, o, f, w, arm, air, al, oft, or, trowal, for, short, will, be, caused, by, strong, southerly, winds, on, its, eastern, periphery, rotating, aloft, around, its, northeast, and, ultimately, into, its, northwestern, periphery, also, known, as, the, warm, conveyor, belt, forcing, a, surface, trough, to, continue, into, the, cold, sector, on, a, similar, curve, to, the, occluded, front, the, trowal, creates, the, portion, of, an, occluded, cyclone, known, as, its, comma, head, due, to, the, comma, like, shape, of, the, mid, tropospheric, cloudiness, that, accompanies, the, feature, it, can, also, be, the, focus, of, locally, heavy, precipitation, with, thunderstorms, possible, if, the, atmosphere, along, the, trowal, is, unstable, enough, for, convection, extratropical, cyclones, slant, back, into, colder, air, masses, and, strengthen, with, height, sometimes, exceeding, 30, 000, feet, approximately, 9, km, in, depth, above, the, surface, of, the, earth, the, air, temperature, near, the, center, of, the, cyclone, is, increasingly, colder, than, the, surrounding, environment, these, characteristics, are, the, direct, opposite, of, those, found, in, their, counterparts, tropical, cyclones, thus, they, are, sometimes, called, cold, core, lows, various, charts, can, be, examined, to, check, the, characteristics, of, a, cold, core, system, with, height, such, as, the, 700, millibars, 20, 67, inhg, chart, which, is, at, about, 10, 000, feet, 3, 048, meters, altitude, cyclone, phase, diagrams, are, used, to, tell, whether, a, cyclone, is, tropical, subtropical, or, extratropical, there, are, two, models, of, cyclone, development, and, life, cycles, in, common, use, the, norwegian, model, and, the, shapiro, keyser, model, of, the, two, theories, on, extratropical, cyclone, structure, and, life, cycle, the, older, is, the, norwegian, cyclone, model, developed, during, world, war, i, in, this, theory, cyclones, develop, as, they, move, up, and, along, a, frontal, boundary, eventually, occluding, and, reaching, a, barotropically, cold, environment, it, was, developed, completely, from, surface, based, weather, observations, including, descriptions, of, clouds, found, near, frontal, boundaries, this, theory, still, retains, merit, as, it, is, a, good, description, for, extratropical, cyclones, over, continental, landmasses, a, second, competing, theory, for, extratropical, cyclone, development, over, the, oceans, is, the, shapiro, keyser, model, developed, in, 1990, its, main, differences, with, the, norwegian, cyclone, model, are, the, fracture, of, the, cold, front, treating, warm, type, occlusions, and, warm, fronts, as, the, same, and, allowing, the, cold, front, to, progress, through, the, warm, sector, perpendicular, to, the, warm, front, this, model, was, based, on, oceanic, cyclones, and, their, frontal, structure, as, seen, in, surface, observations, and, in, previous, projects, which, used, aircraft, to, determine, the, vertical, structure, of, fronts, across, the, northwest, atlantic, a, warm, seclusion, is, the, mature, phase, of, the, extratropical, cyclone, life, cycle, this, was, conceptualized, after, the, erica, field, experiment, of, the, late, 1980s, which, produced, observations, of, intense, marine, cyclones, that, indicated, an, anomalously, warm, low, level, thermal, structure, secluded, or, surrounded, by, a, bent, back, warm, front, and, a, coincident, chevron, shaped, band, of, intense, surface, winds, the, norwegian, cyclone, model, as, developed, by, the, bergen, school, of, meteorology, largely, observed, cyclones, at, the, tail, end, of, their, lifecycle, and, used, the, term, occlusion, to, identify, the, decaying, stages, warm, seclusions, may, have, cloud, free, eye, like, features, at, their, center, reminiscent, of, tropical, cyclones, significant, pressure, falls, hurricane, force, winds, and, moderate, to, strong, convection, the, most, intense, warm, seclusions, often, attain, pressures, less, than, 950, millibars, 28, 05, inhg, with, a, definitive, lower, to, mid, level, warm, core, structure, a, warm, seclusion, the, result, of, a, baroclinic, lifecycle, occurs, at, latitudes, well, poleward, of, the, tropics, as, latent, heat, flux, releases, are, important, for, their, development, and, intensification, most, warm, seclusion, events, occur, over, the, oceans, they, may, impact, coastal, nations, with, hurricane, force, winds, and, torrential, rain, climatologically, the, northern, hemisphere, sees, warm, seclusions, during, the, cold, season, months, while, the, southern, hemisphere, may, see, a, strong, cyclone, event, such, as, this, during, all, times, of, the, year, in, all, tropical, basins, except, the, northern, indian, ocean, the, extratropical, transition, of, a, tropical, cyclone, may, result, in, reintensification, into, a, warm, seclusion, for, example, hurricane, maria, 2005, and, hurricane, cristobal, 2014, each, re, intensified, into, a, strong, baroclinic, system, and, achieved, warm, seclusion, status, at, maturity, or, lowest, pressure, extratropical, cyclones, are, generally, driven, or, steered, by, deep, westerly, winds, in, a, general, west, to, east, motion, across, both, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, of, the, earth, this, general, motion, of, atmospheric, flow, is, known, as, zonal, where, this, general, trend, is, the, main, steering, influence, of, an, extratropical, cyclone, it, is, known, as, a, zonal, flow, regime, when, the, general, flow, pattern, buckles, from, a, zonal, pattern, to, the, meridional, pattern, a, slower, movement, in, a, north, or, southward, direction, is, more, likely, meridional, flow, patterns, feature, strong, amplified, troughs, and, ridges, generally, with, more, northerly, and, southerly, flow, changes, in, direction, of, this, nature, are, most, commonly, observed, as, a, result, of, a, cyclone, s, interaction, with, other, low, pressure, systems, troughs, ridges, or, with, anticyclones, a, strong, and, stationary, anticyclone, can, effectively, block, the, path, of, an, extratropical, cyclone, such, blocking, patterns, are, quite, normal, and, will, generally, result, in, a, weakening, of, the, cyclone, the, weakening, of, the, anticyclone, a, diversion, of, the, cyclone, towards, the, anticyclone, s, periphery, or, a, combination, of, all, three, to, some, extent, depending, on, the, precise, conditions, it, is, also, common, for, an, extratropical, cyclone, to, strengthen, as, the, blocking, anticyclone, or, ridge, weakens, in, these, circumstances, where, an, extratropical, cyclone, encounters, another, extratropical, cyclone, or, almost, any, other, kind, of, cyclonic, vortex, in, the, atmosphere, the, two, may, combine, to, become, a, binary, cyclone, where, the, vortices, of, the, two, cyclones, rotate, around, each, other, known, as, the, fujiwhara, effect, this, most, often, results, in, a, merging, of, the, two, low, pressure, systems, into, a, single, extratropical, cyclone, or, can, less, commonly, result, in, a, mere, change, of, direction, of, either, one, or, both, of, the, cyclones, the, precise, results, of, such, interactions, depend, on, factors, such, as, the, size, of, the, two, cyclones, their, strength, their, distance, from, each, other, and, the, prevailing, atmospheric, conditions, around, them, extratropical, cyclones, can, bring, little, rain, and, surface, winds, of, 15, 30, km, h, 10, 20, mph, or, they, can, be, dangerous, with, torrential, rain, and, winds, exceeding, 119, km, h, 74, mph, and, so, they, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, windstorms, in, europe, the, band, of, precipitation, that, is, associated, with, the, warm, front, is, often, extensive, in, mature, extratropical, cyclones, an, area, known, as, the, comma, head, on, the, northwest, periphery, of, the, surface, low, can, be, a, region, of, heavy, precipitation, frequent, thunderstorms, and, thundersnows, cyclones, tend, to, move, along, a, predictable, path, at, a, moderate, rate, of, progress, during, fall, winter, and, spring, the, atmosphere, over, continents, can, be, cold, enough, through, the, depth, of, the, troposphere, to, cause, snowfall, squall, lines, or, solid, bands, of, strong, thunderstorms, can, form, ahead, of, cold, fronts, and, lee, troughs, due, to, the, presence, of, significant, atmospheric, moisture, and, strong, upper, level, divergence, leading, to, hail, and, high, winds, when, significant, directional, wind, shear, exists, in, the, atmosphere, ahead, of, a, cold, front, in, the, presence, of, a, strong, upper, level, jet, stream, tornado, formation, is, possible, although, tornadoes, can, form, anywhere, on, earth, the, greatest, number, occur, in, the, great, plains, in, the, united, states, because, downsloped, winds, off, the, north, south, oriented, rocky, mountains, which, can, form, a, dry, line, aid, their, development, at, any, strength, explosive, development, of, extratropical, cyclones, can, be, sudden, the, storm, known, in, great, britain, and, ireland, as, the, great, storm, of, 1987, deepened, to, 953, millibars, 28, 14, inhg, with, a, highest, recorded, wind, of, 220, km, h, 140, mph, resulting, in, the, loss, of, 19, lives, 15, million, trees, widespread, damage, to, homes, and, an, estimated, economic, cost, of, 1, 2, billion, us, 2, 3, billion, although, most, tropical, cyclones, that, become, extratropical, quickly, dissipate, or, are, absorbed, by, another, weather, system, they, can, still, retain, winds, of, hurricane, or, gale, force, in, 1954, hurricane, hazel, became, extratropical, over, north, carolina, as, a, strong, category, 3, storm, the, columbus, day, storm, of, 1962, which, evolved, from, the, remains, of, typhoon, freda, caused, heavy, damage, in, oregon, and, washington, with, widespread, damage, equivalent, to, at, least, a, category, 3, in, 2005, hurricane, wilma, began, to, lose, tropical, characteristics, while, still, sporting, category, 3, force, winds, and, became, fully, extratropical, as, a, category, 1, storm, in, summer, extratropical, cyclones, are, generally, weak, but, some, of, the, systems, can, cause, significant, floods, overland, because, of, torrential, rainfall, the, july, 2016, north, china, cyclone, never, brought, gale, force, sustained, winds, but, it, caused, devastating, floods, in, mainland, china, resulting, in, at, least, 184, deaths, and, 33, 19, billion, us, 4, 96, billion, of, damage, an, emerging, topic, is, the, co, occurrence, of, wind, and, precipitation, extremes, so, called, compound, extreme, events, induced, by, extratropical, cyclones, such, compound, events, account, for, 3, 5, of, the, total, number, of, cyclones, in, the, classic, analysis, by, edward, lorenz, the, lorenz, energy, cycle, extratropical, cyclones, so, called, atmospheric, transients, acts, as, a, mechanism, in, converting, potential, energy, that, is, created, by, pole, to, equator, temperature, gradients, to, eddy, kinetic, energy, in, the, process, the, pole, equator, temperature, gradient, is, reduced, i, e, energy, is, transported, poleward, to, warm, up, the, higher, latitudes, the, existence, of, such, transients, are, also, closely, related, to, the, formation, of, the, icelandic, and, aleutian, low, the, two, most, prominent, general, circulation, features, in, the, mid, to, sub, polar, northern, latitudes, the, two, lows, are, formed, by, both, the, transport, of, kinetic, energy, and, the, latent, heating, the, energy, released, when, water, phase, changed, from, vapor, to, liquid, during, precipitation, from, the, mid, latitude, cyclones, the, most, intense, extratropical, cyclone, on, record, was, a, cyclone, in, the, southern, ocean, in, october, 2022, an, analysis, by, the, european, centre, for, medium, range, weather, forecasts, estimated, a, pressure, of, 900, 7, mbar, 26, 60, inhg, and, a, subsequent, analysis, published, in, geophysical, research, letters, estimated, a, pressure, of, 899, 91, mbar, 26, 574, inhg, the, same, geophysical, research, letters, article, notes, at, least, five, other, extratropical, cyclones, in, the, southern, ocean, with, a, pressure, under, 915, mbar, 27, 0, inhg, in, the, north, atlantic, ocean, the, most, intense, extratropical, cyclone, was, the, braer, storm, which, reached, a, pressure, of, 914, mbar, 27, 0, inhg, in, early, january, 1993, before, the, braer, storm, an, extratropical, cyclone, near, greenland, in, december, 1986, reached, a, minimum, pressure, of, at, least, 916, mbar, 27, 0, inhg, the, west, german, meteorological, service, marked, a, pressure, of, 915, mbar, 27, 0, inhg, with, the, possibility, of, a, pressure, between, 912, 913, mbar, 26, 9, 27, 0, inhg, lower, than, the, braer, storm, the, most, intense, extratropical, cyclone, across, the, north, pacific, ocean, occurred, in, november, 2014, when, a, cyclone, partially, related, to, typhoon, nuri, reached, a, record, low, pressure, of, 920, mbar, 27, inhg, in, october, 2021, the, most, intense, pacific, northwest, windstorm, occurred, off, the, coast, of, oregon, peaking, with, a, pressure, of, 942, mbar, 27, 8, inhg, one, of, the, strongest, nor, easters, occurred, in, january, 2018, in, which, a, cyclone, reached, a, pressure, of, 950, mbar, 28, inhg, extratropical, cyclones, have, been, responsible, for, some, of, the, most, damaging, floods, in, european, history, the, great, storm, of, 1703, killed, over, 8, 000, people, and, the, north, sea, flood, of, 1953, killed, over, 2, 500, and, destroyed, 3, 000, houses, in, 2002, floods, in, europe, caused, by, two, genoa, lows, caused, 27, 115, billion, in, damages, and, 232, fatalities, the, most, damaging, flood, in, european, since, at, least, 1985, in, late, december, 1999, cyclones, lothar, and, martin, caused, 140, deaths, combined, and, over, 23, billion, in, damages, in, central, europe, the, costliest, european, windstorms, in, history, in, october, 2012, hurricane, sandy, transitioned, into, an, extratropical, cyclone, off, the, coast, of, the, northeastern, united, states, over, 100, people, were, killed, and, 65, billion, in, damages, the, second, costliest, tropical, cyclone, at, the, time, other,
