in, meteorology, a, cloud, is, an, aerosol, consisting, of, a, visible, mass, of, miniature, liquid, droplets, frozen, crystals, or, other, particles, suspended, in, the, atmosphere, of, a, planetary, body, or, similar, space, water, or, various, other, chemicals, may, compose, the, droplets, and, crystals, on, earth, clouds, are, formed, as, a, result, of, saturation, of, the, air, when, it, is, cooled, to, its, dew, point, or, when, it, gains, sufficient, moisture, usually, in, the, form, of, water, vapor, from, an, adjacent, source, to, raise, the, dew, point, to, the, ambient, temperature, clouds, are, seen, in, the, earth, s, homosphere, which, includes, the, troposphere, stratosphere, and, mesosphere, nephology, is, the, science, of, clouds, which, is, undertaken, in, the, cloud, physics, branch, of, meteorology, there, are, two, methods, of, naming, clouds, in, their, respective, layers, of, the, homosphere, latin, and, common, name, genus, types, in, the, troposphere, the, atmospheric, layer, closest, to, earth, s, surface, have, latin, names, because, of, the, universal, adoption, of, luke, howard, s, nomenclature, that, was, formally, proposed, in, 1802, it, became, the, basis, of, a, modern, international, system, that, divides, clouds, into, five, physical, forms, which, can, be, further, divided, or, classified, into, altitude, levels, to, derive, ten, basic, genera, the, main, representative, cloud, types, for, each, of, these, forms, are, stratiform, cumuliform, stratocumuliform, cumulonimbiform, and, cirriform, low, level, clouds, do, not, have, any, altitude, related, prefixes, however, mid, level, stratiform, and, stratocumuliform, types, are, given, the, prefix, alto, while, high, level, variants, of, these, same, two, forms, carry, the, prefix, cirro, in, both, cases, strato, is, dropped, from, the, latter, form, to, avoid, double, prefixing, genus, types, with, sufficient, vertical, extent, to, occupy, more, than, one, level, do, not, carry, any, altitude, related, prefixes, they, are, classified, formally, as, low, or, mid, level, depending, on, the, altitude, at, which, each, initially, forms, and, are, also, more, informally, characterized, as, multi, level, or, vertical, most, of, the, ten, genera, derived, by, this, method, of, classification, can, be, subdivided, into, species, and, further, subdivided, into, varieties, very, low, stratiform, clouds, that, extend, down, to, the, earth, s, surface, are, given, the, common, names, fog, and, mist, but, have, no, latin, names, in, the, stratosphere, and, mesosphere, clouds, have, common, names, for, their, main, types, they, may, have, the, appearance, of, stratiform, veils, or, sheets, cirriform, wisps, or, stratocumuliform, bands, or, ripples, they, are, seen, infrequently, mostly, in, the, polar, regions, of, earth, clouds, have, been, observed, in, the, atmospheres, of, other, planets, and, moons, in, the, solar, system, and, beyond, however, due, to, their, different, temperature, characteristics, they, are, often, composed, of, other, substances, such, as, methane, ammonia, and, sulfuric, acid, as, well, as, water, tropospheric, clouds, can, have, a, direct, effect, on, climate, change, on, earth, they, may, reflect, incoming, rays, from, the, sun, which, can, contribute, to, a, cooling, effect, where, and, when, these, clouds, occur, or, trap, longer, wave, radiation, that, reflects, back, up, from, the, earth, s, surface, which, can, cause, a, warming, effect, the, altitude, form, and, thickness, of, the, clouds, are, the, main, factors, that, affect, the, local, heating, or, cooling, of, the, earth, and, the, atmosphere, clouds, that, form, above, the, troposphere, are, too, scarce, and, too, thin, to, have, any, influence, on, climate, change, clouds, are, the, main, uncertainty, in, climate, sensitivity, the, origin, of, the, term, cloud, can, be, found, in, the, old, english, words, clud, or, clod, meaning, a, hill, or, a, mass, of, stone, around, the, beginning, of, the, 13th, century, the, word, came, to, be, used, as, a, metaphor, for, rain, clouds, because, of, the, similarity, in, appearance, between, a, mass, of, rock, and, cumulus, heap, cloud, over, time, the, metaphoric, usage, of, the, word, supplanted, the, old, english, weolcan, which, had, been, the, literal, term, for, clouds, in, general, the, table, that, follows, is, very, broad, in, scope, like, the, cloud, genera, template, upon, which, it, is, partly, based, there, are, some, variations, in, styles, of, nomenclature, between, the, classification, scheme, used, for, the, troposphere, strict, latin, except, for, surface, based, aerosols, and, the, higher, levels, of, the, homosphere, common, terms, some, informally, derived, from, latin, however, the, schemes, presented, here, share, a, cross, classification, of, physical, forms, and, altitude, levels, to, derive, the, 10, tropospheric, genera, the, fog, and, mist, that, forms, at, surface, level, and, several, additional, major, types, above, the, troposphere, the, cumulus, genus, includes, four, species, that, indicate, vertical, size, which, can, affect, the, altitude, levels, ancient, cloud, studies, were, not, made, in, isolation, but, were, observed, in, combination, with, other, weather, elements, and, even, other, natural, sciences, around, 340, bc, greek, philosopher, aristotle, wrote, meteorologica, a, work, which, represented, the, sum, of, knowledge, of, the, time, about, natural, science, including, weather, and, climate, for, the, first, time, precipitation, and, the, clouds, from, which, precipitation, fell, were, called, meteors, which, originate, from, the, greek, word, meteoros, meaning, high, in, the, sky, from, that, word, came, the, modern, term, meteorology, the, study, of, clouds, and, weather, meteorologica, was, based, on, intuition, and, simple, observation, but, not, on, what, is, now, considered, the, scientific, method, nevertheless, it, was, the, first, known, work, that, attempted, to, treat, a, broad, range, of, meteorological, topics, in, a, systematic, way, especially, the, hydrological, cycle, after, centuries, of, speculative, theories, about, the, formation, and, behavior, of, clouds, the, first, truly, scientific, studies, were, undertaken, by, luke, howard, in, england, and, jean, baptiste, lamarck, in, france, howard, was, a, methodical, observer, with, a, strong, grounding, in, the, latin, language, and, used, his, background, to, formally, classify, the, various, tropospheric, cloud, types, during, 1802, he, believed, that, scientific, observations, of, the, changing, cloud, forms, in, the, sky, could, unlock, the, key, to, weather, forecasting, lamarck, had, worked, independently, on, cloud, classification, the, same, year, and, had, come, up, with, a, different, naming, scheme, that, failed, to, make, an, impression, even, in, his, home, country, of, france, because, it, used, unusually, descriptive, and, informal, french, names, and, phrases, for, cloud, types, his, system, of, nomenclature, included, 12, categories, of, clouds, with, such, names, as, translated, from, french, hazy, clouds, dappled, clouds, and, broom, like, clouds, by, contrast, howard, used, universally, accepted, latin, which, caught, on, quickly, after, it, was, published, in, 1803, as, a, sign, of, the, popularity, of, the, naming, scheme, german, dramatist, and, poet, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, composed, four, poems, about, clouds, dedicating, them, to, howard, an, elaboration, of, howard, s, system, was, eventually, formally, adopted, by, the, international, meteorological, conference, in, 1891, this, system, covered, only, the, tropospheric, cloud, types, however, the, discovery, of, clouds, above, the, troposphere, during, the, late, 19th, century, eventually, led, to, the, creation, of, separate, classification, schemes, that, reverted, to, the, use, of, descriptive, common, names, and, phrases, that, somewhat, recalled, lamarck, s, methods, of, classification, these, very, high, clouds, although, classified, by, these, different, methods, are, nevertheless, broadly, similar, to, some, cloud, forms, identified, in, the, troposphere, with, latin, names, terrestrial, clouds, can, be, found, throughout, most, of, the, homosphere, which, includes, the, troposphere, stratosphere, and, mesosphere, within, these, layers, of, the, atmosphere, air, can, become, saturated, as, a, result, of, being, cooled, to, its, dew, point, or, by, having, moisture, added, from, an, adjacent, source, in, the, latter, case, saturation, occurs, when, the, dew, point, is, raised, to, the, ambient, air, temperature, adiabatic, cooling, occurs, when, one, or, more, of, three, possible, lifting, agents, convective, cyclonic, frontal, or, orographic, cause, a, parcel, of, air, containing, invisible, water, vapor, to, rise, and, cool, to, its, dew, point, the, temperature, at, which, the, air, becomes, saturated, the, main, mechanism, behind, this, process, is, adiabatic, cooling, as, the, air, is, cooled, to, its, dew, point, and, becomes, saturated, water, vapor, normally, condenses, to, form, cloud, drops, this, condensation, normally, occurs, on, cloud, condensation, nuclei, such, as, salt, or, dust, particles, that, are, small, enough, to, be, held, aloft, by, normal, circulation, of, the, air, one, agent, is, the, convective, upward, motion, of, air, caused, by, daytime, solar, heating, at, surface, level, low, level, airmass, instability, allows, for, the, formation, of, cumuliform, clouds, in, the, troposphere, that, can, produce, showers, if, the, air, is, sufficiently, moist, on, moderately, rare, occasions, convective, lift, can, be, powerful, enough, to, penetrate, the, tropopause, and, push, the, cloud, top, into, the, stratosphere, frontal, and, cyclonic, lift, occur, in, the, troposphere, when, stable, air, is, forced, aloft, at, weather, fronts, and, around, centers, of, low, pressure, by, a, process, called, convergence, warm, fronts, associated, with, extratropical, cyclones, tend, to, generate, mostly, cirriform, and, stratiform, clouds, over, a, wide, area, unless, the, approaching, warm, airmass, is, unstable, in, which, case, cumulus, congestus, or, cumulonimbus, clouds, are, usually, embedded, in, the, main, precipitating, cloud, layer, cold, fronts, are, usually, faster, moving, and, generate, a, narrower, line, of, clouds, which, are, mostly, stratocumuliform, cumuliform, or, cumulonimbiform, depending, on, the, stability, of, the, warm, airmass, just, ahead, of, the, front, a, third, source, of, lift, is, wind, circulation, forcing, air, over, a, physical, barrier, such, as, a, mountain, orographic, lift, if, the, air, is, generally, stable, nothing, more, than, lenticular, cap, clouds, form, however, if, the, air, becomes, sufficiently, moist, and, unstable, orographic, showers, or, thunderstorms, may, appear, clouds, formed, by, any, of, these, lifting, agents, are, initially, seen, in, the, troposphere, where, these, agents, are, most, active, however, water, vapor, that, has, been, lifted, to, the, top, of, troposphere, can, be, carried, even, higher, by, gravity, waves, where, further, condensation, can, result, in, the, formation, of, clouds, in, the, stratosphere, and, mesosphere, along, with, adiabatic, cooling, that, requires, a, lifting, agent, three, major, nonadiabatic, mechanisms, exist, for, lowering, the, temperature, of, the, air, to, its, dew, point, conductive, radiational, and, evaporative, cooling, require, no, lifting, mechanism, and, can, cause, condensation, at, surface, level, resulting, in, the, formation, of, fog, several, main, sources, of, water, vapor, can, be, added, to, the, air, as, a, way, of, achieving, saturation, without, any, cooling, process, evaporation, from, surface, water, or, moist, ground, precipitation, or, virga, and, transpiration, from, plants, classification, in, the, troposphere, is, based, on, a, hierarchy, of, categories, with, physical, forms, and, altitude, levels, at, the, top, these, are, cross, classified, into, a, total, of, ten, genus, types, most, of, which, can, be, divided, into, species, and, further, subdivided, into, varieties, which, are, at, the, bottom, of, the, hierarchy, clouds, in, the, troposphere, assume, five, physical, forms, based, on, structure, and, process, of, formation, these, forms, are, commonly, used, for, the, purpose, of, satellite, analysis, they, are, given, below, in, approximate, ascending, order, of, instability, or, convective, activity, tropospheric, clouds, form, in, any, of, three, levels, formerly, called, tages, based, on, altitude, range, above, the, earth, s, surface, the, grouping, of, clouds, into, levels, is, commonly, done, for, the, purposes, of, cloud, atlases, surface, weather, observations, and, weather, maps, the, base, height, range, for, each, level, varies, depending, on, the, latitudinal, geographical, zone, each, altitude, level, comprises, two, or, three, genus, types, differentiated, mainly, by, physical, form, the, standard, levels, and, genus, types, are, summarised, below, in, approximate, descending, order, of, the, altitude, at, which, each, is, normally, based, multi, level, clouds, with, significant, vertical, extent, are, separately, listed, and, summarized, in, approximate, ascending, order, of, instability, or, convective, activity, high, clouds, form, at, altitudes, of, 3, 000, to, 7, 600, m, 10, 000, to, 25, 000, ft, in, the, polar, regions, 5, 000, to, 12, 200, m, 16, 500, to, 40, 000, ft, in, the, temperate, regions, and, 6, 100, to, 18, 300, m, 20, 000, to, 60, 000, ft, in, the, tropics, all, cirriform, clouds, are, classified, as, high, thus, constitute, a, single, genus, cirrus, ci, stratocumuliform, and, stratiform, clouds, in, the, high, altitude, range, carry, the, prefix, cirro, yielding, the, respective, genus, names, cirrocumulus, cc, and, cirrostratus, cs, if, limited, resolution, satellite, images, of, high, clouds, are, analyzed, without, supporting, data, from, direct, human, observations, distinguishing, between, individual, forms, or, genus, types, becomes, impossible, and, they, are, collectively, identified, as, high, type, or, informally, as, cirrus, type, though, not, all, high, clouds, are, of, the, cirrus, form, or, genus, nonvertical, clouds, in, the, middle, level, are, prefixed, by, alto, yielding, the, genus, names, altocumulus, ac, for, stratocumuliform, types, and, altostratus, as, for, stratiform, types, these, clouds, can, form, as, low, as, 2, 000, m, 6, 500, ft, above, surface, at, any, latitude, but, may, be, based, as, high, as, 4, 000, m, 13, 000, ft, near, the, poles, 7, 000, m, 23, 000, ft, at, midlatitudes, and, 7, 600, m, 25, 000, ft, in, the, tropics, as, with, high, clouds, the, main, genus, types, are, easily, identified, by, the, human, eye, but, distinguishing, between, them, using, satellite, photography, alone, is, not, possible, when, the, supporting, data, of, human, observations, are, not, available, these, clouds, are, usually, collectively, identified, as, middle, type, on, satellite, images, low, clouds, are, found, from, near, the, surface, up, to, 2, 000, m, 6, 500, ft, genus, types, in, this, level, either, have, no, prefix, or, carry, one, that, refers, to, a, characteristic, other, than, altitude, clouds, that, form, in, the, low, level, of, the, troposphere, are, generally, of, larger, structure, than, those, that, form, in, the, middle, and, high, levels, so, they, can, usually, be, identified, by, their, forms, and, genus, types, using, satellite, photography, alone, these, clouds, have, low, to, mid, level, bases, that, form, anywhere, from, near, the, surface, to, about, 2, 400, m, 8, 000, ft, and, tops, that, can, extend, into, the, mid, altitude, range, and, sometimes, higher, in, the, case, of, nimbostratus, these, very, large, cumuliform, and, cumulonimbiform, types, have, cloud, bases, in, the, same, low, to, mid, level, range, as, the, multi, level, and, moderate, vertical, types, but, the, tops, nearly, always, extend, into, the, high, levels, unlike, less, vertically, developed, clouds, they, are, required, to, be, identified, by, their, standard, names, or, abbreviations, in, all, aviation, observations, metars, and, forecasts, tafs, to, warn, pilots, of, possible, severe, weather, and, turbulence, genus, types, are, commonly, divided, into, subtypes, called, species, that, indicate, specific, structural, details, which, can, vary, according, to, the, stability, and, windshear, characteristics, of, the, atmosphere, at, any, given, time, and, location, despite, this, hierarchy, a, particular, species, may, be, a, subtype, of, more, than, one, genus, especially, if, the, genera, are, of, the, same, physical, form, and, are, differentiated, from, each, other, mainly, by, altitude, or, level, there, are, a, few, species, each, of, which, can, be, associated, with, genera, of, more, than, one, physical, form, the, species, types, are, grouped, below, according, to, the, physical, forms, and, genera, with, which, each, is, normally, associated, the, forms, genera, and, species, are, listed, from, left, to, right, in, approximate, ascending, order, of, instability, or, convective, activity, of, the, non, convective, stratiform, group, high, level, cirrostratus, comprises, two, species, cirrostratus, nebulosus, has, a, rather, diffuse, appearance, lacking, in, structural, detail, cirrostratus, fibratus, is, a, species, made, of, semi, merged, filaments, that, are, transitional, to, or, from, cirrus, mid, level, altostratus, and, multi, level, nimbostratus, always, have, a, flat, or, diffuse, appearance, and, are, therefore, not, subdivided, into, species, low, stratus, is, of, the, species, nebulosus, except, when, broken, up, into, ragged, sheets, of, stratus, fractus, see, below, cirriform, clouds, have, three, non, convective, species, that, can, form, in, stable, airmass, conditions, cirrus, fibratus, comprise, filaments, that, may, be, straight, wavy, or, occasionally, twisted, by, wind, shear, the, species, uncinus, is, similar, but, has, upturned, hooks, at, the, ends, cirrus, spissatus, appear, as, opaque, patches, that, can, show, light, gray, shading, stratocumuliform, genus, types, cirrocumulus, altocumulus, and, stratocumulus, that, appear, in, mostly, stable, air, with, limited, convection, have, two, species, each, the, stratiformis, species, normally, occur, in, extensive, sheets, or, in, smaller, patches, where, there, is, only, minimal, convective, activity, clouds, of, the, lenticularis, species, tend, to, have, lens, like, shapes, tapered, at, the, ends, they, are, most, commonly, seen, as, orographic, mountain, wave, clouds, but, can, occur, anywhere, in, the, troposphere, where, there, is, strong, wind, shear, combined, with, sufficient, airmass, stability, to, maintain, a, generally, flat, cloud, structure, these, two, species, can, be, found, in, the, high, middle, or, low, levels, of, the, troposphere, depending, on, the, stratocumuliform, genus, or, genera, present, at, any, given, time, the, species, fractus, shows, variable, instability, because, it, can, be, a, subdivision, of, genus, types, of, different, physical, forms, that, have, different, stability, characteristics, this, subtype, can, be, in, the, form, of, ragged, but, mostly, stable, stratiform, sheets, stratus, fractus, or, small, ragged, cumuliform, heaps, with, somewhat, greater, instability, cumulus, fractus, when, clouds, of, this, species, are, associated, with, precipitating, cloud, systems, of, considerable, vertical, and, sometimes, horizontal, extent, they, are, also, classified, as, accessory, clouds, under, the, name, pannus, see, section, on, supplementary, features, these, species, are, subdivisions, of, genus, types, that, can, occur, in, partly, unstable, air, with, limited, convection, the, species, castellanus, appears, when, a, mostly, stable, stratocumuliform, or, cirriform, layer, becomes, disturbed, by, localized, areas, of, airmass, instability, usually, in, the, morning, or, afternoon, this, results, in, the, formation, of, embedded, cumuliform, buildups, arising, from, a, common, stratiform, base, castellanus, resembles, the, turrets, of, a, castle, when, viewed, from, the, side, and, can, be, found, with, stratocumuliform, genera, at, any, tropospheric, altitude, level, and, with, limited, convective, patches, of, high, level, cirrus, tufted, clouds, of, the, more, detached, floccus, species, are, subdivisions, of, genus, types, which, may, be, cirriform, or, stratocumuliform, in, overall, structure, they, are, sometimes, seen, with, cirrus, cirrocumulus, altocumulus, and, stratocumulus, a, newly, recognized, species, of, stratocumulus, or, altocumulus, has, been, given, the, name, volutus, a, roll, cloud, that, can, occur, ahead, of, a, cumulonimbus, formation, there, are, some, volutus, clouds, that, form, as, a, consequence, of, interactions, with, specific, geographical, features, rather, than, with, a, parent, cloud, perhaps, the, strangest, geographically, specific, cloud, of, this, type, is, the, morning, glory, a, rolling, cylindrical, cloud, that, appears, unpredictably, over, the, gulf, of, carpentaria, in, northern, australia, associated, with, a, powerful, ripple, in, the, atmosphere, the, cloud, may, be, surfed, in, glider, aircraft, more, general, airmass, instability, in, the, troposphere, tends, to, produce, clouds, of, the, more, freely, convective, cumulus, genus, type, whose, species, are, mainly, indicators, of, degrees, of, atmospheric, instability, and, resultant, vertical, development, of, the, clouds, a, cumulus, cloud, initially, forms, in, the, low, level, of, the, troposphere, as, a, cloudlet, of, the, species, humilis, that, shows, only, slight, vertical, development, if, the, air, becomes, more, unstable, the, cloud, tends, to, grow, vertically, into, the, species, mediocris, then, strongly, convective, congestus, the, tallest, cumulus, species, which, is, the, same, type, that, the, international, civil, aviation, organization, refers, to, as, towering, cumulus, with, highly, unstable, atmospheric, conditions, large, cumulus, may, continue, to, grow, into, even, more, strongly, convective, cumulonimbus, calvus, essentially, a, very, tall, congestus, cloud, that, produces, thunder, then, ultimately, into, the, species, capillatus, when, supercooled, water, droplets, at, the, top, of, the, cloud, turn, into, ice, crystals, giving, it, a, cirriform, appearance, genus, and, species, types, are, further, subdivided, into, varieties, whose, names, can, appear, after, the, species, name, to, provide, a, fuller, description, of, a, cloud, some, cloud, varieties, are, not, restricted, to, a, specific, altitude, level, or, form, and, can, therefore, be, common, to, more, than, one, genus, or, species, all, cloud, varieties, fall, into, one, of, two, main, groups, one, group, identifies, the, opacities, of, particular, low, and, mid, level, cloud, structures, and, comprises, the, varieties, translucidus, thin, translucent, perlucidus, thick, opaque, with, translucent, or, very, small, clear, breaks, and, opacus, thick, opaque, these, varieties, are, always, identifiable, for, cloud, genera, and, species, with, variable, opacity, all, three, are, associated, with, the, stratiformis, species, of, altocumulus, and, stratocumulus, however, only, two, varieties, are, seen, with, altostratus, and, stratus, nebulosus, whose, uniform, structures, prevent, the, formation, of, a, perlucidus, variety, opacity, based, varieties, are, not, applied, to, high, clouds, because, they, are, always, translucent, or, in, the, case, of, cirrus, spissatus, always, opaque, a, second, group, describes, the, occasional, arrangements, of, cloud, structures, into, particular, patterns, that, are, discernible, by, a, surface, based, observer, cloud, fields, usually, being, visible, only, from, a, significant, altitude, above, the, formations, these, varieties, are, not, always, present, with, the, genera, and, species, with, which, they, are, otherwise, associated, but, only, appear, when, atmospheric, conditions, favor, their, formation, intortus, and, vertebratus, varieties, occur, on, occasion, with, cirrus, fibratus, they, are, respectively, filaments, twisted, into, irregular, shapes, and, those, that, are, arranged, in, fishbone, patterns, usually, by, uneven, wind, currents, that, favor, the, formation, of, these, varieties, the, variety, radiatus, is, associated, with, cloud, rows, of, a, particular, type, that, appear, to, converge, at, the, horizon, it, is, sometimes, seen, with, the, fibratus, and, uncinus, species, of, cirrus, the, stratiformis, species, of, altocumulus, and, stratocumulus, the, mediocris, and, sometimes, humilis, species, of, cumulus, and, with, the, genus, altostratus, another, variety, duplicatus, closely, spaced, layers, of, the, same, type, one, above, the, other, is, sometimes, found, with, cirrus, of, both, the, fibratus, and, uncinus, species, and, with, altocumulus, and, stratocumulus, of, the, species, stratiformis, and, lenticularis, the, variety, undulatus, having, a, wavy, undulating, base, can, occur, with, any, clouds, of, the, species, stratiformis, or, lenticularis, and, with, altostratus, it, is, only, rarely, observed, with, stratus, nebulosus, the, variety, lacunosus, is, caused, by, localized, downdrafts, that, create, circular, holes, in, the, form, of, a, honeycomb, or, net, it, is, occasionally, seen, with, cirrocumulus, and, altocumulus, of, the, species, stratiformis, castellanus, and, floccus, and, with, stratocumulus, of, the, species, stratiformis, and, castellanus, it, is, possible, for, some, species, to, show, combined, varieties, at, one, time, especially, if, one, variety, is, opacity, based, and, the, other, is, pattern, based, an, example, of, this, would, be, a, layer, of, altocumulus, stratiformis, arranged, in, seemingly, converging, rows, separated, by, small, breaks, the, full, technical, name, of, a, cloud, in, this, configuration, would, be, altocumulus, stratiformis, radiatus, perlucidus, which, would, identify, respectively, its, genus, species, and, two, combined, varieties, supplementary, features, and, accessory, clouds, are, not, further, subdivisions, of, cloud, types, below, the, species, and, variety, level, rather, they, are, either, hydrometeors, or, special, cloud, types, with, their, own, latin, names, that, form, in, association, with, certain, cloud, genera, species, and, varieties, supplementary, features, whether, in, the, form, of, clouds, or, precipitation, are, directly, attached, to, the, main, genus, cloud, accessory, clouds, by, contrast, are, generally, detached, from, the, main, cloud, one, group, of, supplementary, features, are, not, actual, cloud, formations, but, precipitation, that, falls, when, water, droplets, or, ice, crystals, that, make, up, visible, clouds, have, grown, too, heavy, to, remain, aloft, virga, is, a, feature, seen, with, clouds, producing, precipitation, that, evaporates, before, reaching, the, ground, these, being, of, the, genera, cirrocumulus, altocumulus, altostratus, nimbostratus, stratocumulus, cumulus, and, cumulonimbus, when, the, precipitation, reaches, the, ground, without, completely, evaporating, it, is, designated, as, the, feature, praecipitatio, this, normally, occurs, with, altostratus, opacus, which, can, produce, widespread, but, usually, light, precipitation, and, with, thicker, clouds, that, show, significant, vertical, development, of, the, latter, upward, growing, cumulus, mediocris, produces, only, isolated, light, showers, while, downward, growing, nimbostratus, is, capable, of, heavier, more, extensive, precipitation, towering, vertical, clouds, have, the, greatest, ability, to, produce, intense, precipitation, events, but, these, tend, to, be, localized, unless, organized, along, fast, moving, cold, fronts, showers, of, moderate, to, heavy, intensity, can, fall, from, cumulus, congestus, clouds, cumulonimbus, the, largest, of, all, cloud, genera, has, the, capacity, to, produce, very, heavy, showers, low, stratus, clouds, usually, produce, only, light, precipitation, but, this, always, occurs, as, the, feature, praecipitatio, due, to, the, fact, this, cloud, genus, lies, too, close, to, the, ground, to, allow, for, the, formation, of, virga, incus, is, the, most, type, specific, supplementary, feature, seen, only, with, cumulonimbus, of, the, species, capillatus, a, cumulonimbus, incus, cloud, top, is, one, that, has, spread, out, into, a, clear, anvil, shape, as, a, result, of, rising, air, currents, hitting, the, stability, layer, at, the, tropopause, where, the, air, no, longer, continues, to, get, colder, with, increasing, altitude, the, mamma, feature, forms, on, the, bases, of, clouds, as, downward, facing, bubble, like, protuberances, caused, by, localized, downdrafts, within, the, cloud, it, is, also, sometimes, called, mammatus, an, earlier, version, of, the, term, used, before, a, standardization, of, latin, nomenclature, brought, about, by, the, world, meteorological, organization, during, the, 20th, century, the, best, known, is, cumulonimbus, with, mammatus, but, the, mamma, feature, is, also, seen, occasionally, with, cirrus, cirrocumulus, altocumulus, altostratus, and, stratocumulus, a, tuba, feature, is, a, cloud, column, that, may, hang, from, the, bottom, of, a, cumulus, or, cumulonimbus, a, newly, formed, or, poorly, organized, column, might, be, comparatively, benign, but, can, quickly, intensify, into, a, funnel, cloud, or, tornado, an, arcus, feature, is, a, roll, cloud, with, ragged, edges, attached, to, the, lower, front, part, of, cumulus, congestus, or, cumulonimbus, that, forms, along, the, leading, edge, of, a, squall, line, or, thunderstorm, outflow, a, large, arcus, formation, can, have, the, appearance, of, a, dark, menacing, arch, several, new, supplementary, features, have, been, formally, recognized, by, the, world, meteorological, organization, wmo, the, feature, fluctus, can, form, under, conditions, of, strong, atmospheric, wind, shear, when, a, stratocumulus, altocumulus, or, cirrus, cloud, breaks, into, regularly, spaced, crests, this, variant, is, sometimes, known, informally, as, a, kelvin, helmholtz, wave, cloud, this, phenomenon, has, also, been, observed, in, cloud, formations, over, other, planets, and, even, in, the, sun, s, atmosphere, another, highly, disturbed, but, more, chaotic, wave, like, cloud, feature, associated, with, stratocumulus, or, altocumulus, cloud, has, been, given, the, latin, name, asperitas, the, supplementary, feature, cavum, is, a, circular, fall, streak, hole, that, occasionally, forms, in, a, thin, layer, of, supercooled, altocumulus, or, cirrocumulus, fall, streaks, consisting, of, virga, or, wisps, of, cirrus, are, usually, seen, beneath, the, hole, as, ice, crystals, fall, out, to, a, lower, altitude, this, type, of, hole, is, usually, larger, than, typical, lacunosus, holes, a, murus, feature, is, a, cumulonimbus, wall, cloud, with, a, lowering, rotating, cloud, base, than, can, lead, to, the, development, of, tornadoes, a, cauda, feature, is, a, tail, cloud, that, extends, horizontally, away, from, the, murus, cloud, and, is, the, result, of, air, feeding, into, the, storm, supplementary, cloud, formations, detached, from, the, main, cloud, are, known, as, accessory, clouds, the, heavier, precipitating, clouds, nimbostratus, towering, cumulus, cumulus, congestus, and, cumulonimbus, typically, see, the, formation, in, precipitation, of, the, pannus, feature, low, ragged, clouds, of, the, genera, and, species, cumulus, fractus, or, stratus, fractus, a, group, of, accessory, clouds, comprise, formations, that, are, associated, mainly, with, upward, growing, cumuliform, and, cumulonimbiform, clouds, of, free, convection, pileus, is, a, cap, cloud, that, can, form, over, a, cumulonimbus, or, large, cumulus, cloud, whereas, a, velum, feature, is, a, thin, horizontal, sheet, that, sometimes, forms, like, an, apron, around, the, middle, or, in, front, of, the, parent, cloud, an, accessory, cloud, recently, officially, recognized, by, the, world, meteorological, organization, is, the, flumen, also, known, more, informally, as, the, beaver, s, tail, it, is, formed, by, the, warm, humid, inflow, of, a, super, cell, thunderstorm, and, can, be, mistaken, for, a, tornado, although, the, flumen, can, indicate, a, tornado, risk, it, is, similar, in, appearance, to, pannus, or, scud, clouds, and, does, not, rotate, clouds, initially, form, in, clear, air, or, become, clouds, when, fog, rises, above, surface, level, the, genus, of, a, newly, formed, cloud, is, determined, mainly, by, air, mass, characteristics, such, as, stability, and, moisture, content, if, these, characteristics, change, over, time, the, genus, tends, to, change, accordingly, when, this, happens, the, original, genus, is, called, a, mother, cloud, if, the, mother, cloud, retains, much, of, its, original, form, after, the, appearance, of, the, new, genus, it, is, termed, a, genitus, cloud, one, example, of, this, is, stratocumulus, cumulogenitus, a, stratocumulus, cloud, formed, by, the, partial, spreading, of, a, cumulus, type, when, there, is, a, loss, of, convective, lift, if, the, mother, cloud, undergoes, a, complete, change, in, genus, it, is, considered, to, be, a, mutatus, cloud, the, genitus, and, mutatus, categories, have, been, expanded, to, include, certain, types, that, do, not, originate, from, pre, existing, clouds, the, term, flammagenitus, latin, for, fire, made, applies, to, cumulus, congestus, or, cumulonimbus, that, are, formed, by, large, scale, fires, or, volcanic, eruptions, smaller, low, level, pyrocumulus, or, fumulus, clouds, formed, by, contained, industrial, activity, are, now, classified, as, cumulus, homogenitus, latin, for, man, made, contrails, formed, from, the, exhaust, of, aircraft, flying, in, the, upper, level, of, the, troposphere, can, persist, and, spread, into, formations, resembling, cirrus, which, are, designated, cirrus, homogenitus, if, a, cirrus, homogenitus, cloud, changes, fully, to, any, of, the, high, level, genera, they, are, termed, cirrus, cirrostratus, or, cirrocumulus, homomutatus, stratus, cataractagenitus, latin, for, cataract, made, are, generated, by, the, spray, from, waterfalls, silvagenitus, latin, for, forest, made, is, a, stratus, cloud, that, forms, as, water, vapor, is, added, to, the, air, above, a, forest, canopy, sometimes, certain, atmospheric, processes, cause, clouds, to, become, organized, into, patterns, that, can, cover, large, areas, these, patterns, are, usually, difficult, to, identify, from, surface, level, and, are, best, seen, from, an, aircraft, or, spacecraft, stratocumulus, clouds, can, be, organized, into, fields, that, take, on, certain, specially, classified, shapes, and, characteristics, in, general, these, fields, are, more, discernible, from, high, altitudes, than, from, ground, level, they, can, often, be, found, in, the, following, forms, these, patterns, are, formed, from, a, phenomenon, known, as, a, k, rm, n, vortex, which, is, named, after, the, engineer, and, fluid, dynamicist, theodore, von, k, rm, n, wind, driven, clouds, usually, mid, level, altocumulus, or, high, level, cirrus, can, form, into, parallel, rows, that, follow, the, wind, direction, when, the, wind, and, clouds, encounter, high, elevation, land, features, such, as, a, vertically, prominent, islands, they, can, form, eddies, around, the, high, land, masses, that, give, the, clouds, a, twisted, appearance, although, the, local, distribution, of, clouds, can, be, significantly, influenced, by, topography, the, global, prevalence, of, cloud, cover, in, the, troposphere, tends, to, vary, more, by, latitude, it, is, most, prevalent, in, and, along, low, pressure, zones, of, surface, tropospheric, convergence, which, encircle, the, earth, close, to, the, equator, and, near, the, 50th, parallels, of, latitude, in, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, the, adiabatic, cooling, processes, that, lead, to, the, creation, of, clouds, by, way, of, lifting, agents, are, all, associated, with, convergence, a, process, that, involves, the, horizontal, inflow, and, accumulation, of, air, at, a, given, location, as, well, as, the, rate, at, which, this, happens, near, the, equator, increased, cloudiness, is, due, to, the, presence, of, the, low, pressure, intertropical, convergence, zone, itcz, where, very, warm, and, unstable, air, promotes, mostly, cumuliform, and, cumulonimbiform, clouds, clouds, of, virtually, any, type, can, form, along, the, mid, latitude, convergence, zones, depending, on, the, stability, and, moisture, content, of, the, air, these, extratropical, convergence, zones, are, occupied, by, the, polar, fronts, where, air, masses, of, polar, origin, meet, and, clash, with, those, of, tropical, or, subtropical, origin, this, leads, to, the, formation, of, weather, making, extratropical, cyclones, composed, of, cloud, systems, that, may, be, stable, or, unstable, to, varying, degrees, according, to, the, stability, characteristics, of, the, various, airmasses, that, are, in, conflict, divergence, is, the, opposite, of, convergence, in, the, earth, s, troposphere, it, involves, the, horizontal, outflow, of, air, from, the, upper, part, of, a, rising, column, of, air, or, from, the, lower, part, of, a, subsiding, column, often, associated, with, an, area, or, ridge, of, high, pressure, cloudiness, tends, to, be, least, prevalent, near, the, poles, and, in, the, subtropics, close, to, the, 30th, parallels, north, and, south, the, latter, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, horse, latitudes, the, presence, of, a, large, scale, high, pressure, subtropical, ridge, on, each, side, of, the, equator, reduces, cloudiness, at, these, low, latitudes, similar, patterns, also, occur, at, higher, latitudes, in, both, hemispheres, the, luminance, or, brightness, of, a, cloud, is, determined, by, how, light, is, reflected, scattered, and, transmitted, by, the, cloud, s, particles, its, brightness, may, also, be, affected, by, the, presence, of, haze, or, photometeors, such, as, halos, and, rainbows, in, the, troposphere, dense, deep, clouds, exhibit, a, high, reflectance, 70, 95, throughout, the, visible, spectrum, tiny, particles, of, water, are, densely, packed, and, sunlight, cannot, penetrate, far, into, the, cloud, before, it, is, reflected, out, giving, a, cloud, its, characteristic, white, color, especially, when, viewed, from, the, top, cloud, droplets, tend, to, scatter, light, efficiently, so, that, the, intensity, of, the, solar, radiation, decreases, with, depth, into, the, gases, as, a, result, the, cloud, base, can, vary, from, a, very, light, to, very, dark, gray, depending, on, the, cloud, s, thickness, and, how, much, light, is, being, reflected, or, transmitted, back, to, the, observer, high, thin, tropospheric, clouds, reflect, less, light, because, of, the, comparatively, low, concentration, of, constituent, ice, crystals, or, supercooled, water, droplets, which, results, in, a, slightly, off, white, appearance, however, a, thick, dense, ice, crystal, cloud, appears, brilliant, white, with, pronounced, gray, shading, because, of, its, greater, reflectivity, as, a, tropospheric, cloud, matures, the, dense, water, droplets, may, combine, to, produce, larger, droplets, if, the, droplets, become, too, large, and, heavy, to, be, kept, aloft, by, the, air, circulation, they, will, fall, from, the, cloud, as, rain, by, this, process, of, accumulation, the, space, between, droplets, becomes, increasingly, larger, permitting, light, to, penetrate, farther, into, the, cloud, if, the, cloud, is, sufficiently, large, and, the, droplets, within, are, spaced, far, enough, apart, a, percentage, of, the, light, that, enters, the, cloud, is, not, reflected, back, out, but, is, absorbed, giving, the, cloud, a, darker, look, a, simple, example, of, this, is, one, s, being, able, to, see, farther, in, heavy, rain, than, in, heavy, fog, this, process, of, reflection, absorption, is, what, causes, the, range, of, cloud, color, from, white, to, black, striking, cloud, colorations, can, be, seen, at, any, altitude, with, the, color, of, a, cloud, usually, being, the, same, as, the, incident, light, during, daytime, when, the, sun, is, relatively, high, in, the, sky, tropospheric, clouds, generally, appear, bright, white, on, top, with, varying, shades, of, gray, underneath, thin, clouds, may, look, white, or, appear, to, have, acquired, the, color, of, their, environment, or, background, red, orange, and, pink, clouds, occur, almost, entirely, at, sunrise, sunset, and, are, the, result, of, the, scattering, of, sunlight, by, the, atmosphere, when, the, sun, is, just, below, the, horizon, low, level, clouds, are, gray, middle, clouds, appear, rose, colored, and, high, clouds, are, white, or, off, white, clouds, at, night, are, black, or, dark, gray, in, a, moonless, sky, or, whitish, when, illuminated, by, the, moon, they, may, also, reflect, the, colors, of, large, fires, city, lights, or, auroras, that, might, be, present, a, cumulonimbus, cloud, that, appears, to, have, a, greenish, or, bluish, tint, is, a, sign, that, it, contains, extremely, high, amounts, of, water, hail, or, rain, which, scatter, light, in, a, way, that, gives, the, cloud, a, blue, color, a, green, colorization, occurs, mostly, late, in, the, day, when, the, sun, is, comparatively, low, in, the, sky, and, the, incident, sunlight, has, a, reddish, tinge, that, appears, green, when, illuminating, a, very, tall, bluish, cloud, supercell, type, storms, are, more, likely, to, be, characterized, by, this, but, any, storm, can, appear, this, way, coloration, such, as, this, does, not, directly, indicate, that, it, is, a, severe, thunderstorm, it, only, confirms, its, potential, since, a, green, blue, tint, signifies, copious, amounts, of, water, a, strong, updraft, to, support, it, high, winds, from, the, storm, raining, out, and, wet, hail, all, elements, that, improve, the, chance, for, it, to, become, severe, can, all, be, inferred, from, this, in, addition, the, stronger, the, updraft, is, the, more, likely, the, storm, is, to, undergo, tornadogenesis, and, to, produce, large, hail, and, high, winds, yellowish, clouds, may, be, seen, in, the, troposphere, in, the, late, spring, through, early, fall, months, during, forest, fire, season, the, yellow, color, is, due, to, the, presence, of, pollutants, in, the, smoke, yellowish, clouds, are, caused, by, the, presence, of, nitrogen, dioxide, and, are, sometimes, seen, in, urban, areas, with, high, air, pollution, levels, tropospheric, clouds, exert, numerous, influences, on, earth, s, troposphere, and, climate, first, and, foremost, they, are, the, source, of, precipitation, thereby, greatly, influencing, the, distribution, and, amount, of, precipitation, because, of, their, differential, buoyancy, relative, to, surrounding, cloud, free, air, clouds, can, be, associated, with, vertical, motions, of, the, air, that, may, be, convective, frontal, or, cyclonic, the, motion, is, upward, if, the, clouds, are, less, dense, because, condensation, of, water, vapor, releases, heat, warming, the, air, and, thereby, decreasing, its, density, this, can, lead, to, downward, motion, because, lifting, of, the, air, results, in, cooling, that, increases, its, density, all, of, these, effects, are, subtly, dependent, on, the, vertical, temperature, and, moisture, structure, of, the, atmosphere, and, result, in, major, redistribution, of, heat, that, affect, the, earth, s, climate, the, complexity, and, diversity, of, clouds, in, the, troposphere, is, a, major, reason, for, difficulty, in, quantifying, the, effects, of, clouds, on, climate, and, climate, change, on, the, one, hand, white, cloud, tops, promote, cooling, of, earth, s, surface, by, reflecting, shortwave, radiation, visible, and, near, infrared, from, the, sun, diminishing, the, amount, of, solar, radiation, that, is, absorbed, at, the, surface, enhancing, the, earth, s, albedo, most, of, the, sunlight, that, reaches, the, ground, is, absorbed, warming, the, surface, which, emits, radiation, upward, at, longer, infrared, wavelengths, at, these, wavelengths, however, water, in, the, clouds, acts, as, an, efficient, absorber, the, water, reacts, by, radiating, also, in, the, infrared, both, upward, and, downward, and, the, downward, longwave, radiation, results, in, increased, warming, at, the, surface, this, is, analogous, to, the, greenhouse, effect, of, greenhouse, gases, and, water, vapor, high, level, genus, types, particularly, show, this, duality, with, both, short, wave, albedo, cooling, and, long, wave, greenhouse, warming, effects, on, the, whole, ice, crystal, clouds, in, the, upper, troposphere, cirrus, tend, to, favor, net, warming, however, the, cooling, effect, is, dominant, with, mid, level, and, low, clouds, especially, when, they, form, in, extensive, sheets, measurements, by, nasa, indicate, that, on, the, whole, the, effects, of, low, and, mid, level, clouds, that, tend, to, promote, cooling, outweigh, the, warming, effects, of, high, layers, and, the, variable, outcomes, associated, with, vertically, developed, clouds, as, difficult, as, it, is, to, evaluate, the, influences, of, current, clouds, on, current, climate, it, is, even, more, problematic, to, predict, changes, in, cloud, patterns, and, properties, in, a, future, warmer, climate, and, the, resultant, cloud, influences, on, future, climate, in, a, warmer, climate, more, water, would, enter, the, atmosphere, by, evaporation, at, the, surface, as, clouds, are, formed, from, water, vapor, cloudiness, would, be, expected, to, increase, but, in, a, warmer, climate, higher, temperatures, would, tend, to, evaporate, clouds, both, of, these, statements, are, considered, accurate, and, both, phenomena, known, as, cloud, feedbacks, are, found, in, climate, model, calculations, broadly, speaking, if, clouds, especially, low, clouds, increase, in, a, warmer, climate, the, resultant, cooling, effect, leads, to, a, negative, feedback, in, climate, response, to, increased, greenhouse, gases, but, if, low, clouds, decrease, or, if, high, clouds, increase, the, feedback, is, positive, differing, amounts, of, these, feedbacks, are, the, principal, reason, for, differences, in, climate, sensitivities, of, current, global, climate, models, as, a, consequence, much, research, has, focused, on, the, response, of, low, and, vertical, clouds, to, a, changing, climate, leading, global, models, produce, quite, different, results, however, with, some, showing, increasing, low, clouds, and, others, showing, decreases, for, these, reasons, the, role, of, tropospheric, clouds, in, regulating, weather, and, climate, remains, a, leading, source, of, uncertainty, in, global, warming, projections, polar, stratospheric, clouds, psc, s, are, found, in, the, lowest, part, of, the, stratosphere, moisture, is, scarce, above, the, troposphere, so, nacreous, and, non, nacreous, clouds, at, this, altitude, range, are, restricted, to, polar, regions, in, the, winter, where, and, when, the, air, is, coldest, psc, s, show, some, variation, in, structure, according, to, their, chemical, makeup, and, atmospheric, conditions, but, are, limited, to, a, single, very, high, range, of, altitude, of, about, 15, 000, 25, 000, m, 49, 200, 82, 000, ft, accordingly, they, are, classified, as, a, singular, type, with, no, differentiated, altitude, levels, genus, types, species, or, varieties, there, is, no, latin, nomenclature, in, the, manner, of, tropospheric, clouds, but, rather, descriptive, names, of, several, general, forms, using, common, english, supercooled, nitric, acid, and, water, psc, s, sometimes, known, as, type, 1, typically, have, a, stratiform, appearance, resembling, cirrostratus, or, haze, but, because, they, are, not, frozen, into, crystals, do, not, show, the, pastel, colors, of, the, nacreous, types, this, type, of, psc, has, been, identified, as, a, cause, of, ozone, depletion, in, the, stratosphere, the, frozen, nacreous, types, are, typically, very, thin, with, mother, of, pearl, colorations, and, an, undulating, cirriform, or, lenticular, stratocumuliform, appearance, these, are, sometimes, known, as, type, 2, noctilucent, clouds, are, the, highest, in, the, atmosphere, and, are, found, near, the, top, of, the, mesosphere, at, about, 80, to, 85, km, 50, to, 53, mi, or, roughly, ten, times, the, altitude, of, tropospheric, high, clouds, they, are, given, this, latin, derived, name, because, of, their, illumination, well, after, sunset, and, before, sunrise, they, typically, have, a, bluish, or, silvery, white, coloration, that, can, resemble, brightly, illuminated, cirrus, noctilucent, clouds, may, occasionally, take, on, more, of, a, red, or, orange, hue, they, are, not, common, or, widespread, enough, to, have, a, significant, effect, on, climate, however, an, increasing, frequency, of, occurrence, of, noctilucent, clouds, since, the, 19th, century, may, be, the, result, of, climate, change, ongoing, research, indicates, that, convective, lift, in, the, mesosphere, is, strong, enough, during, the, polar, summer, to, cause, adiabatic, cooling, of, small, amount, of, water, vapor, to, the, point, of, saturation, this, tends, to, produce, the, coldest, temperatures, in, the, entire, atmosphere, just, below, the, mesopause, there, is, evidence, that, smoke, particles, from, burnt, up, meteors, provide, much, of, the, condensation, nuclei, required, for, the, formation, of, noctilucent, cloud, noctilucent, clouds, have, four, major, types, based, on, physical, structure, and, appearance, type, i, veils, are, very, tenuous, and, lack, well, defined, structure, somewhat, like, cirrostratus, fibratus, or, poorly, defined, cirrus, type, ii, bands, are, long, streaks, that, often, occur, in, groups, arranged, roughly, parallel, to, each, other, they, are, usually, more, widely, spaced, than, the, bands, or, elements, seen, with, cirrocumulus, clouds, type, iii, billows, are, arrangements, of, closely, spaced, roughly, parallel, short, streaks, that, mostly, resemble, cirrus, type, iv, whirls, are, partial, or, more, rarely, complete, rings, of, cloud, with, dark, centers, distribution, in, the, mesosphere, is, similar, to, the, stratosphere, except, at, much, higher, altitudes, because, of, the, need, for, maximum, cooling, of, the, water, vapor, to, produce, noctilucent, clouds, their, distribution, tends, to, be, restricted, to, polar, regions, of, earth, sightings, are, rare, more, than, 45, degrees, south, of, the, north, pole, or, north, of, the, south, pole, cloud, cover, has, been, seen, on, most, other, planets, in, the, solar, system, venus, s, thick, clouds, are, composed, of, sulfur, dioxide, due, to, volcanic, activity, and, appear, to, be, almost, entirely, stratiform, they, are, arranged, in, three, main, layers, at, altitudes, of, 45, to, 65, km, that, obscure, the, planet, s, surface, and, can, produce, virga, no, embedded, cumuliform, types, have, been, identified, but, broken, stratocumuliform, wave, formations, are, sometimes, seen, in, the, top, layer, that, reveal, more, continuous, layer, clouds, underneath, on, mars, noctilucent, cirrus, cirrocumulus, and, stratocumulus, composed, of, water, ice, have, been, detected, mostly, near, the, poles, water, ice, fogs, have, also, been, detected, on, mars, both, jupiter, and, saturn, have, an, outer, cirriform, cloud, deck, composed, of, ammonia, an, intermediate, stratiform, haze, cloud, layer, made, of, ammonium, hydrosulfide, and, an, inner, deck, of, cumulus, water, clouds, embedded, cumulonimbus, are, known, to, exist, near, the, great, red, spot, on, jupiter, the, same, category, types, can, be, found, covering, uranus, and, neptune, but, are, all, composed, of,
