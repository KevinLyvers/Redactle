a, planetary, system, is, a, set, of, gravitationally, bound, non, stellar, bodies, in, or, out, of, orbit, around, a, star, or, star, system, generally, speaking, systems, with, one, or, more, planets, constitute, a, planetary, system, although, such, systems, may, also, consist, of, bodies, such, as, dwarf, planets, asteroids, natural, satellites, meteoroids, comets, planetesimals, and, circumstellar, disks, for, example, the, sun, together, with, the, planetary, system, revolving, around, it, including, earth, form, the, solar, system, the, term, exoplanetary, system, is, sometimes, used, in, reference, to, other, planetary, systems, as, of, 24, july, 2024, there, are, 7, 026, confirmed, exoplanets, in, 4, 949, planetary, systems, with, 1007, systems, having, more, than, one, planet, debris, disks, are, known, to, be, common, while, other, objects, are, more, difficult, to, observe, of, particular, interest, to, astrobiology, is, the, habitable, zone, of, planetary, systems, where, planets, could, have, surface, liquid, water, and, thus, the, capacity, to, support, earth, like, life, heliocentrism, is, the, doctrine, that, the, sun, is, at, the, centre, of, the, universe, as, opposed, to, geocentrism, placing, earth, at, the, centre, of, the, universe, the, notion, of, a, heliocentric, solar, system, with, the, sun, at, its, centre, is, possibly, first, suggested, in, the, vedic, literature, of, ancient, india, which, often, refers, to, the, sun, as, the, centre, of, spheres, some, interpret, aryabhatta, s, writings, in, ryabha, ya, as, implicitly, heliocentric, the, idea, was, first, proposed, in, western, philosophy, and, greek, astronomy, as, early, as, the, 3rd, century, bc, by, aristarchus, of, samos, but, received, no, support, from, most, other, ancient, astronomers, de, revolutionibus, orbium, coelestium, by, nicolaus, copernicus, published, in, 1543, presented, the, first, mathematically, predictive, heliocentric, model, of, a, planetary, system, 17th, century, successors, galileo, galilei, johannes, kepler, and, sir, isaac, newton, developed, an, understanding, of, physics, which, led, to, the, gradual, acceptance, of, the, idea, that, the, earth, moves, around, the, sun, and, that, the, planets, are, governed, by, the, same, physical, laws, that, governed, earth, in, the, 16th, century, the, italian, philosopher, giordano, bruno, an, early, supporter, of, the, copernican, theory, that, earth, and, other, planets, orbit, the, sun, put, forward, the, view, that, the, fixed, stars, are, similar, to, the, sun, and, are, likewise, accompanied, by, planets, he, was, burned, at, the, stake, for, his, ideas, by, the, roman, inquisition, in, the, 18th, century, the, same, possibility, was, mentioned, by, sir, isaac, newton, in, the, general, scholium, that, concludes, his, principia, making, a, comparison, to, the, sun, s, planets, he, wrote, and, if, the, fixed, stars, are, the, centres, of, similar, systems, they, will, all, be, constructed, according, to, a, similar, design, and, subject, to, the, dominion, of, one, his, theories, gained, popularity, through, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, despite, a, lack, of, supporting, evidence, long, before, their, confirmation, by, astronomers, conjecture, on, the, nature, of, planetary, systems, had, been, a, focus, of, the, search, for, extraterrestrial, intelligence, and, has, been, a, prevalent, theme, in, fiction, particularly, science, fiction, the, first, confirmed, detection, of, an, exoplanet, was, in, 1992, with, the, discovery, of, several, terrestrial, mass, planets, orbiting, the, pulsar, psr, b1257, 12, the, first, confirmed, detection, of, exoplanets, of, a, main, sequence, star, was, made, in, 1995, when, a, giant, planet, 51, pegasi, b, was, found, in, a, four, day, orbit, around, the, nearby, g, type, star, 51, pegasi, the, frequency, of, detections, has, increased, since, then, particularly, through, advancements, in, methods, of, detecting, extrasolar, planets, and, dedicated, planet, finding, programs, such, as, the, kepler, mission, planetary, systems, come, from, protoplanetary, disks, that, form, around, stars, as, part, of, the, process, of, star, formation, during, formation, of, a, system, much, material, is, gravitationally, scattered, into, distant, orbits, and, some, planets, are, ejected, completely, from, the, system, becoming, rogue, planets, planets, orbiting, pulsars, have, been, discovered, pulsars, are, the, remnants, of, the, supernova, explosions, of, high, mass, stars, but, a, planetary, system, that, existed, before, the, supernova, would, likely, be, mostly, destroyed, planets, would, either, evaporate, be, pushed, off, of, their, orbits, by, the, masses, of, gas, from, the, exploding, star, or, the, sudden, loss, of, most, of, the, mass, of, the, central, star, would, see, them, escape, the, gravitational, hold, of, the, star, or, in, some, cases, the, supernova, would, kick, the, pulsar, itself, out, of, the, system, at, high, velocity, so, any, planets, that, had, survived, the, explosion, would, be, left, behind, as, free, floating, objects, planets, found, around, pulsars, may, have, formed, as, a, result, of, pre, existing, stellar, companions, that, were, almost, entirely, evaporated, by, the, supernova, blast, leaving, behind, planet, sized, bodies, alternatively, planets, may, form, in, an, accretion, disk, of, fallback, matter, surrounding, a, pulsar, fallback, disks, of, matter, that, failed, to, escape, orbit, during, a, supernova, may, also, form, planets, around, black, holes, as, stars, evolve, and, turn, into, red, giants, asymptotic, giant, branch, stars, and, planetary, nebulae, they, engulf, the, inner, planets, evaporating, or, partially, evaporating, them, depending, on, how, massive, they, are, as, the, star, loses, mass, planets, that, are, not, engulfed, move, further, out, from, the, star, if, an, evolved, star, is, in, a, binary, or, multiple, system, then, the, mass, it, loses, can, transfer, to, another, star, forming, new, protoplanetary, disks, and, second, and, third, generation, planets, which, may, differ, in, composition, from, the, original, planets, which, may, also, be, affected, by, the, mass, transfer, the, solar, system, consists, of, an, inner, region, of, small, rocky, planets, and, outer, region, of, large, giant, planets, however, other, planetary, systems, can, have, quite, different, architectures, studies, suggest, that, architectures, of, planetary, systems, are, dependent, on, the, conditions, of, their, initial, formation, many, systems, with, a, hot, jupiter, gas, giant, very, close, to, the, star, have, been, found, theories, such, as, planetary, migration, or, scattering, have, been, proposed, for, the, formation, of, large, planets, close, to, their, parent, stars, at, present, few, systems, have, been, found, to, be, analogous, to, the, solar, system, with, terrestrial, planets, close, to, the, parent, star, more, commonly, systems, consisting, of, multiple, super, earths, have, been, detected, planetary, system, architectures, may, be, partitioned, into, four, classes, based, on, how, the, mass, of, the, planets, is, distributed, around, the, host, star, most, known, exoplanets, orbit, stars, roughly, similar, to, the, sun, that, is, main, sequence, stars, of, spectral, categories, f, g, or, k, one, reason, is, that, planet, search, programs, have, tended, to, concentrate, on, such, stars, in, addition, statistical, analyses, indicate, that, lower, mass, stars, red, dwarfs, of, spectral, category, m, are, less, likely, to, have, planets, massive, enough, to, be, detected, by, the, radial, velocity, method, nevertheless, several, tens, of, planets, around, red, dwarfs, have, been, discovered, by, the, kepler, space, telescope, by, the, transit, method, which, can, detect, smaller, planets, after, planets, circumstellar, disks, are, one, of, the, most, commonly, observed, properties, of, planetary, systems, particularly, of, young, stars, the, solar, system, possesses, at, least, four, major, circumstellar, disks, the, asteroid, belt, kuiper, belt, scattered, disc, and, oort, cloud, and, clearly, observable, disks, have, been, detected, around, nearby, solar, analogs, including, epsilon, eridani, and, tau, ceti, based, on, observations, of, numerous, similar, disks, they, are, assumed, to, be, quite, common, attributes, of, stars, on, the, main, sequence, interplanetary, dust, clouds, have, been, studied, in, the, solar, system, and, analogs, are, believed, to, be, present, in, other, planetary, systems, exozodiacal, dust, an, exoplanetary, analog, of, zodiacal, dust, the, 1, 100, micrometre, sized, grains, of, amorphous, carbon, and, silicate, dust, that, fill, the, plane, of, the, solar, system, has, been, detected, around, the, 51, ophiuchi, fomalhaut, tau, ceti, and, vega, systems, as, of, november, 2014, there, are, 5, 253, known, solar, system, comets, and, they, are, thought, to, be, common, components, of, planetary, systems, the, first, exocomets, were, detected, in, 1987, around, beta, pictoris, a, very, young, a, type, main, sequence, star, there, are, now, a, total, of, 11, stars, around, which, the, presence, of, exocomets, have, been, observed, or, suspected, all, discovered, exocometary, systems, beta, pictoris, hr, 10, 51, ophiuchi, hr, 2174, 49, ceti, 5, vulpeculae, 2, andromedae, hd, 21620, hd, 42111, hd, 110411, and, more, recently, hd, 172555, are, around, very, young, a, type, stars, computer, modelling, of, an, impact, in, 2013, detected, around, the, star, ngc, 2547, id8, by, the, spitzer, space, telescope, and, confirmed, by, ground, observations, suggests, the, involvement, of, large, asteroids, or, protoplanets, similar, to, the, events, believed, to, have, led, to, the, formation, of, terrestrial, planets, like, the, earth, based, on, observations, of, the, solar, system, s, large, collection, of, natural, satellites, they, are, believed, common, components, of, planetary, systems, however, the, existence, of, exomoons, has, not, yet, been, confirmed, the, star, 1swasp, j140747, 93, 394542, 6, in, the, constellation, centaurus, is, a, strong, candidate, for, a, natural, satellite, indications, suggest, that, the, confirmed, extrasolar, planet, wasp, 12b, also, has, at, least, one, satellite, unlike, the, solar, system, which, has, orbits, that, are, nearly, circular, many, of, the, known, planetary, systems, display, much, higher, orbital, eccentricity, an, example, of, such, a, system, is, 16, cygni, the, mutual, inclination, between, two, planets, is, the, angle, between, their, orbital, planes, many, compact, systems, with, multiple, close, in, planets, interior, to, the, equivalent, orbit, of, venus, are, expected, to, have, very, low, mutual, inclinations, so, the, system, at, least, the, close, in, part, would, be, even, flatter, than, the, solar, system, captured, planets, could, be, captured, into, any, arbitrary, angle, to, the, rest, of, the, system, as, of, 2016, there, are, only, a, few, systems, where, mutual, inclinations, have, actually, been, measured, one, example, is, the, upsilon, andromedae, system, the, planets, c, and, d, have, a, mutual, inclination, of, about, 30, degrees, planetary, systems, can, be, categorized, according, to, their, orbital, dynamics, as, resonant, non, resonant, interacting, hierarchical, or, some, combination, of, these, in, resonant, systems, the, orbital, periods, of, the, planets, are, in, integer, ratios, the, kepler, 223, system, contains, four, planets, in, an, 8, 6, 4, 3, orbital, resonance, giant, planets, are, found, in, mean, motion, resonances, more, often, than, smaller, planets, in, interacting, systems, the, planets, orbits, are, close, enough, together, that, they, perturb, the, orbital, parameters, the, solar, system, could, be, described, as, weakly, interacting, in, strongly, interacting, systems, kepler, s, laws, do, not, hold, in, hierarchical, systems, the, planets, are, arranged, so, that, the, system, can, be, gravitationally, considered, as, a, nested, system, of, two, bodies, e, g, in, a, star, with, a, close, in, hot, jupiter, with, another, gas, giant, much, further, out, the, star, and, hot, jupiter, form, a, pair, that, appears, as, a, single, object, to, another, planet, that, is, far, enough, out, other, as, yet, unobserved, orbital, possibilities, include, double, planets, various, co, orbital, planets, such, as, quasi, satellites, trojans, and, exchange, orbits, and, interlocking, orbits, maintained, by, precessing, orbital, planes, free, floating, planets, in, open, clusters, have, similar, velocities, to, the, stars, and, so, can, be, recaptured, they, are, typically, captured, into, wide, orbits, between, 100, and, 10, 5, au, the, capture, efficiency, decreases, with, increasing, cluster, size, and, for, a, given, cluster, size, it, increases, with, the, host, primary, mass, it, is, almost, independent, of, the, planetary, mass, single, and, multiple, planets, could, be, captured, into, arbitrary, unaligned, orbits, non, coplanar, with, each, other, or, with, the, stellar, host, spin, or, pre, existing, planetary, system, some, planet, host, metallicity, correlation, may, still, exist, due, to, the, common, origin, of, the, stars, from, the, same, cluster, planets, would, be, unlikely, to, be, captured, around, neutron, stars, because, these, are, likely, to, be, ejected, from, the, cluster, by, a, pulsar, kick, when, they, form, planets, could, even, be, captured, around, other, planets, to, form, free, floating, planet, binaries, after, the, cluster, has, dispersed, some, of, the, captured, planets, with, orbits, larger, than, 10, 6, au, would, be, slowly, disrupted, by, the, galactic, tide, and, likely, become, free, floating, again, through, encounters, with, other, field, stars, or, giant, molecular, clouds, the, habitable, zone, around, a, star, is, the, region, where, the, temperature, range, allows, for, liquid, water, to, exist, on, a, planet, that, is, not, too, close, to, the, star, for, the, water, to, evaporate, and, not, too, far, away, from, the, star, for, the, water, to, freeze, the, heat, produced, by, stars, varies, depending, on, the, size, and, age, of, the, star, this, means, the, habitable, zone, will, also, vary, accordingly, also, the, atmospheric, conditions, on, the, planet, influence, the, planet, s, ability, to, retain, heat, so, that, the, location, of, the, habitable, zone, is, also, specific, to, each, type, of, planet, habitable, zones, have, usually, been, defined, in, terms, of, surface, temperature, however, over, half, of, earth, s, biomass, is, from, subsurface, microbes, and, temperature, increases, as, depth, underground, increases, so, the, subsurface, can, be, conducive, for, life, when, the, surface, is, frozen, if, this, is, considered, the, habitable, zone, extends, much, further, from, the, star, studies, in, 2013, indicate, that, an, estimated, 22, 8, of, sun, like, stars, have, an, earth, sized, planet, in, the, habitable, zone, the, venus, zone, is, the, region, around, a, star, where, a, terrestrial, planet, would, have, runaway, greenhouse, conditions, like, venus, but, not, so, near, the, star, that, the, atmosphere, completely, evaporates, as, with, the, habitable, zone, the, location, of, the, venus, zone, depends, on, several, factors, including, the, type, of, star, and, properties, of, the, planets, such, as, mass, rotation, rate, and, atmospheric, clouds, studies, of, the, kepler, spacecraft, data, indicate, that, 32, of, red, dwarfs, have, potentially, venus, like, planets, based, on, planet, size, and, distance, from, star, increasing, to, 45, for, k, type, and, g, type, stars, several, candidates, have, been, identified, but, spectroscopic, follow, up, studies, of, their, atmospheres, are, required, to, determine, whether, they, are, like, venus, the, milky, way, is, 100, 000, light, years, across, but, 90, of, planets, with, known, distances, are, within, about, 2000, light, years, of, earth, as, of, july, 2014, one, method, that, can, detect, planets, much, further, away, is, microlensing, the, upcoming, nancy, grace, roman, space, telescope, could, use, microlensing, to, measure, the, relative, frequency, of, planets, in, the, galactic, bulge, versus, the, galactic, disk, so, far, the, indications, are, that, planets, are, more, common, in, the, disk, than, the, bulge, estimates, of, the, distance, of, microlensing, events, is, difficult, the, first, planet, considered, with, high, probability, of, being, in, the, bulge, is, moa, 2011, blg, 293lb, at, a, distance, of, 7, 7, kiloparsecs, about, 25, 000, light, years, population, i, or, metal, rich, stars, are, those, young, stars, whose, metallicity, is, highest, the, high, metallicity, of, population, i, stars, makes, them, more, likely, to, possess, planetary, systems, than, older, populations, because, planets, form, by, the, accretion, of, metals, the, sun, is, an, example, of, a, metal, rich, star, these, are, common, in, the, spiral, arms, of, the, milky, way, generally, the, youngest, stars, the, extreme, population, i, are, found, farther, in, and, intermediate, population, i, stars, are, farther, out, etc, the, sun, is, considered, an, intermediate, population, i, star, population, i, stars, have, regular, elliptical, orbits, around, the, galactic, center, with, a, low, relative, velocity, population, ii, or, metal, poor, stars, are, those, with, relatively, low, metallicity, which, can, have, hundreds, e, g, bd, 17, 3248, or, thousands, e, g, sneden, s, star, times, less, metallicity, than, the, sun, these, objects, formed, during, an, earlier, time, of, the, universe, intermediate, population, ii, stars, are, common, in, the, bulge, near, the, center, of, the, milky, way, whereas, population, ii, stars, found, in, the, galactic, halo, are, older, and, thus, more, metal, poor, globular, clusters, also, contain, high, numbers, of, population, ii, stars, in, 2014, the, first, planets, around, a, halo, star, were, announced, around, kapteyn, s, star, the, nearest, halo, star, to, earth, around, 13, light, years, away, however, later, research, suggests, that, kapteyn, b, is, just, an, artefact, of, stellar, activity, and, that, kapteyn, c, needs, more, study, to, be, confirmed, the, metallicity, of, kapteyn, s, star, is, estimated, to, be, about, 8, times, less, than, the, sun, different, types, of, galaxies, have, different, histories, of, star, formation, and, hence, planet, formation, planet, formation, is, affected, by, the, ages, metallicities, and, orbits, of, stellar, populations, within, a, galaxy, distribution, of, stellar, populations, within, a, galaxy, varies, between, the, different, types, of, galaxies, stars, in, elliptical, galaxies, are, much, older, than, stars, in, spiral, galaxies, most, elliptical, galaxies, contain, mainly, low, mass, stars, with, minimal, star, formation, activity, the, distribution, of, the, different, types, of, galaxies, in, the, universe, depends, on, their, location, within, galaxy, clusters, with, elliptical, galaxies, found, mostly, close, to, their, centers
