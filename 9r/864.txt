red, is, the, color, at, the, long, wavelength, end, of, the, visible, spectrum, of, light, next, to, orange, and, opposite, violet, it, has, a, dominant, wavelength, of, approximately, 625, 740, nanometres, it, is, a, primary, color, in, the, rgb, color, model, and, a, secondary, color, made, from, magenta, and, yellow, in, the, cmyk, color, model, and, is, the, complementary, color, of, cyan, reds, range, from, the, brilliant, yellow, tinged, scarlet, and, vermillion, to, bluish, red, crimson, and, vary, in, shade, from, the, pale, red, pink, to, the, dark, red, burgundy, red, pigment, made, from, ochre, was, one, of, the, first, colors, used, in, prehistoric, art, the, ancient, egyptians, and, mayans, colored, their, faces, red, in, ceremonies, roman, generals, had, their, bodies, colored, red, to, celebrate, victories, it, was, also, an, important, color, in, china, where, it, was, used, to, color, early, pottery, and, later, the, gates, and, walls, of, palaces, 60, 61, in, the, renaissance, the, brilliant, red, costumes, for, the, nobility, and, wealthy, were, dyed, with, kermes, and, cochineal, the, 19th, century, brought, the, introduction, of, the, first, synthetic, red, dyes, which, replaced, the, traditional, dyes, red, became, a, symbolic, color, of, communism, and, socialism, soviet, russia, adopted, a, red, flag, following, the, bolshevik, revolution, in, 1917, the, soviet, red, banner, would, subsequently, be, used, throughout, the, entire, history, of, the, soviet, union, starting, from, 1922, and, ending, with, its, 1991, dissolution, china, adopted, its, own, red, flag, following, the, chinese, communist, revolution, a, red, flag, was, also, adopted, by, north, vietnam, in, 1954, and, by, all, of, vietnam, in, 1975, since, red, is, the, color, of, blood, it, has, historically, been, associated, with, sacrifice, danger, and, courage, modern, surveys, in, europe, and, the, united, states, show, red, is, also, the, color, most, commonly, associated, with, heat, activity, passion, sexuality, anger, love, and, joy, in, china, india, and, many, other, asian, countries, it, is, the, color, symbolizing, happiness, and, good, fortune, 39, 63, varieties, of, the, color, red, may, differ, in, hue, chroma, also, called, saturation, intensity, or, colorfulness, or, lightness, or, value, tone, or, brightness, or, in, two, or, three, of, these, qualities, variations, in, value, are, also, called, tints, and, shades, a, tint, being, a, red, or, other, hue, mixed, with, white, a, shade, being, mixed, with, black, four, examples, are, shown, below, the, human, eye, sees, red, when, it, looks, at, light, with, a, wavelength, between, approximately, 625, and, 740, nanometers, it, is, a, primary, color, in, the, rgb, color, model, and, the, light, just, past, this, range, is, called, infrared, or, below, red, and, cannot, be, seen, by, human, eyes, although, it, can, be, sensed, as, heat, in, the, language, of, optics, red, is, the, color, evoked, by, light, that, stimulates, neither, the, s, or, the, m, short, and, medium, wavelength, cone, cells, of, the, retina, combined, with, a, fading, stimulation, of, the, l, long, wavelength, cone, cells, primates, can, distinguish, the, full, range, of, the, colors, of, the, spectrum, visible, to, humans, but, many, kinds, of, mammals, such, as, dogs, and, cattle, have, dichromacy, which, means, they, can, see, blues, and, yellows, but, cannot, distinguish, red, and, green, both, are, seen, as, gray, bulls, for, instance, cannot, see, the, red, color, of, the, cape, of, a, bullfighter, but, they, are, agitated, by, its, movement, see, color, vision, one, theory, for, why, primates, developed, sensitivity, to, red, is, that, it, allowed, ripe, fruit, to, be, distinguished, from, unripe, fruit, and, inedible, vegetation, this, may, have, driven, further, adaptations, by, species, taking, advantage, of, this, new, ability, such, as, the, emergence, of, red, faces, red, light, is, used, to, help, adapt, night, vision, in, low, light, or, night, time, as, the, rod, cells, in, the, human, eye, are, not, sensitive, to, red, in, the, ryb, color, model, which, is, the, basis, of, traditional, color, theory, red, is, one, of, the, three, primary, colors, along, with, blue, and, yellow, painters, in, the, renaissance, mixed, red, and, blue, to, make, violet, cennino, cennini, in, his, 15th, century, manual, on, painting, wrote, if, you, want, to, make, a, lovely, violet, colour, take, fine, lac, red, lake, ultramarine, blue, the, same, amount, of, the, one, as, of, the, other, with, a, binder, he, noted, that, it, could, also, be, made, by, mixing, blue, indigo, and, red, hematite, in, the, cmy, and, cmyk, color, models, red, is, a, secondary, color, subtractively, mixed, from, magenta, and, yellow, in, the, rgb, color, model, red, green, and, blue, are, additive, primary, colors, red, green, and, blue, light, combined, makes, white, light, and, these, three, colors, combined, in, different, mixtures, can, produce, nearly, any, other, color, this, principle, is, used, to, generate, colors, on, such, as, computer, monitors, and, televisions, for, example, magenta, on, a, computer, screen, is, made, by, a, similar, formula, to, that, used, by, cennino, cennini, in, the, renaissance, to, make, violet, but, using, additive, colors, and, light, instead, of, pigment, it, is, created, by, combining, red, and, blue, light, at, equal, intensity, on, a, black, screen, violet, is, made, on, a, computer, screen, in, a, similar, way, but, with, a, greater, amount, of, blue, light, and, less, red, light, as, a, ray, of, white, sunlight, travels, through, the, atmosphere, to, the, eye, some, of, the, colors, are, scattered, out, of, the, beam, by, air, molecules, and, airborne, particles, due, to, rayleigh, scattering, changing, the, final, color, of, the, beam, that, is, seen, colors, with, a, shorter, wavelength, such, as, blue, and, green, scatter, more, strongly, and, are, removed, from, the, light, that, finally, reaches, the, eye, at, sunrise, and, sunset, when, the, path, of, the, sunlight, through, the, atmosphere, to, the, eye, is, longest, the, blue, and, green, components, are, removed, almost, completely, leaving, the, longer, wavelength, orange, and, red, light, the, remaining, reddened, sunlight, can, also, be, scattered, by, cloud, droplets, and, other, relatively, large, particles, which, give, the, sky, above, the, horizon, its, red, glow, lasers, emitting, in, the, red, region, of, the, spectrum, have, been, available, since, the, invention, of, the, ruby, laser, in, 1960, in, 1962, the, red, helium, neon, laser, was, invented, and, these, two, types, of, lasers, were, widely, used, in, many, scientific, applications, including, holography, and, in, education, red, helium, neon, lasers, were, used, commercially, in, laserdisc, players, the, use, of, red, laser, diodes, became, widespread, with, the, commercial, success, of, modern, dvd, players, which, use, a, 660, nm, laser, diode, technology, today, red, and, red, orange, laser, diodes, are, widely, available, to, the, public, in, the, form, of, extremely, inexpensive, laser, pointers, portable, high, powered, versions, are, also, available, for, various, applications, more, recently, 671, nm, diode, pumped, solid, state, dpss, lasers, have, been, introduced, to, the, market, for, all, dpss, laser, display, systems, particle, image, velocimetry, raman, spectroscopy, and, holography, red, s, wavelength, has, been, an, important, factor, in, laser, technologies, red, lasers, used, in, early, compact, disc, technologies, are, being, replaced, by, blue, lasers, as, red, s, longer, wavelength, causes, the, laser, s, recordings, to, take, up, more, space, on, the, disc, than, would, blue, laser, recordings, the, most, common, synthetic, food, coloring, today, is, allura, red, ac, a, red, azo, dye, that, goes, by, several, names, including, allura, red, food, red, 17, c, i, 16035, fd, c, red, 40, it, was, originally, manufactured, from, coal, tar, but, now, is, mostly, made, from, petroleum, in, europe, allura, red, ac, is, not, recommended, for, consumption, by, children, it, is, banned, in, denmark, belgium, france, and, switzerland, and, was, also, banned, in, sweden, until, the, country, joined, the, european, union, in, 1994, the, european, union, approves, allura, red, ac, as, a, food, colorant, but, eu, countries, local, laws, banning, food, colorants, are, preserved, in, the, united, states, allura, red, ac, is, approved, by, the, food, and, drug, administration, fda, for, use, in, cosmetics, drugs, and, food, it, is, used, in, some, tattoo, inks, and, is, used, in, many, products, such, as, soft, drinks, children, s, medications, and, cotton, candy, on, june, 30, 2010, the, center, for, science, in, the, public, interest, cspi, called, for, the, fda, to, ban, red, 40, because, of, public, concerns, about, possible, health, risks, associated, with, synthetic, dyes, many, companies, have, switched, to, using, natural, pigments, such, as, carmine, made, from, crushing, the, tiny, female, cochineal, insect, this, insect, originating, in, mexico, and, central, america, was, used, to, make, the, brilliant, scarlet, dyes, of, the, european, renaissance, the, red, of, autumn, leaves, is, produced, by, pigments, called, anthocyanins, they, are, not, present, in, the, leaf, throughout, the, growing, season, but, are, actively, produced, towards, the, end, of, summer, they, develop, in, late, summer, in, the, sap, of, the, cells, of, the, leaf, and, this, development, is, the, result, of, complex, interactions, of, many, influences, both, inside, and, outside, the, plant, their, formation, depends, on, the, breakdown, of, sugars, in, the, presence, of, bright, light, as, the, level, of, phosphate, in, the, leaf, is, reduced, during, the, summer, growing, season, phosphate, is, at, a, high, level, it, has, a, vital, role, in, the, breakdown, of, the, sugars, manufactured, by, chlorophyll, but, in, the, fall, phosphate, along, with, the, other, chemicals, and, nutrients, moves, out, of, the, leaf, into, the, stem, of, the, plant, when, this, happens, the, sugar, breakdown, process, changes, leading, to, the, production, of, anthocyanin, pigments, the, brighter, the, light, during, this, period, the, greater, the, production, of, anthocyanins, and, the, more, brilliant, the, resulting, color, display, when, the, days, of, autumn, are, bright, and, cool, and, the, nights, are, chilly, but, not, freezing, the, brightest, colorations, usually, develop, anthocyanins, temporarily, color, the, edges, of, some, of, the, very, young, leaves, as, they, unfold, from, the, buds, in, early, spring, they, also, give, the, familiar, color, to, such, common, fruits, as, cranberries, red, apples, blueberries, cherries, raspberries, and, plums, anthocyanins, are, present, in, about, 10, of, tree, species, in, temperate, regions, although, in, certain, areas, a, famous, example, being, new, england, up, to, 70, of, tree, species, may, produce, the, pigment, in, autumn, forests, they, appear, vivid, in, the, maples, oaks, sourwood, sweetgums, dogwoods, tupelos, cherry, trees, and, persimmons, these, same, pigments, often, combine, with, the, carotenoids, colors, to, create, the, deeper, orange, fiery, reds, and, bronzes, typical, of, many, hardwood, species, see, autumn, leaf, color, oxygenated, blood, is, red, due, to, the, presence, of, oxygenated, hemoglobin, that, contains, iron, molecules, with, the, iron, components, reflecting, red, light, red, meat, gets, its, color, from, the, iron, found, in, the, myoglobin, and, hemoglobin, in, the, muscles, and, residual, blood, plants, like, apples, strawberries, cherries, tomatoes, peppers, and, pomegranates, are, often, colored, by, forms, of, carotenoids, red, pigments, that, also, assist, photosynthesis, red, hair, occurs, naturally, on, approximately, 1, 2, of, the, human, population, it, occurs, more, frequently, 2, 6, in, people, of, northern, or, western, european, ancestry, and, less, frequently, in, other, populations, red, hair, appears, in, people, with, two, copies, of, a, recessive, gene, on, chromosome, 16, which, causes, a, mutation, in, the, mc1r, protein, red, hair, varies, from, a, deep, burgundy, through, burnt, orange, to, bright, copper, it, is, characterized, by, high, levels, of, the, reddish, pigment, pheomelanin, which, also, accounts, for, the, red, color, of, the, lips, and, relatively, low, levels, of, the, dark, pigment, eumelanin, the, term, redhead, originally, redd, hede, has, been, in, use, since, at, least, 1510, red, is, associated, with, dominance, in, a, number, of, animal, species, for, example, in, mandrills, red, coloration, of, the, face, is, greatest, in, alpha, males, increasingly, less, prominent, in, lower, ranking, subordinates, and, directly, correlated, with, levels, of, testosterone, red, can, also, affect, the, perception, of, dominance, by, others, leading, to, significant, differences, in, mortality, reproductive, success, and, parental, investment, between, individuals, displaying, red, and, those, not, in, humans, wearing, red, has, been, linked, with, increased, performance, in, competitions, including, professional, sport, and, multiplayer, video, games, controlled, tests, have, demonstrated, that, wearing, red, does, not, increase, performance, or, levels, of, testosterone, during, exercise, so, the, effect, is, likely, to, be, produced, by, perceived, rather, than, actual, performance, judges, of, tae, kwon, do, have, been, shown, to, favor, competitors, wearing, red, protective, gear, over, blue, and, when, asked, a, significant, majority, of, people, say, that, red, abstract, shapes, are, more, dominant, aggressive, and, likely, to, win, a, physical, competition, than, blue, shapes, in, contrast, to, its, positive, effect, in, physical, competition, and, dominance, behavior, exposure, to, red, decreases, performance, in, cognitive, tasks, and, elicits, aversion, in, psychological, tests, where, subjects, are, placed, in, an, achievement, context, e, g, taking, an, iq, test, inside, cave, 13b, at, pinnacle, point, an, archeological, site, found, on, the, coast, of, south, africa, paleoanthropologists, in, 2000, found, evidence, that, between, 170, 000, and, 40, 000, years, ago, late, stone, age, people, were, scraping, and, grinding, ochre, a, clay, colored, red, by, iron, oxide, probably, with, the, intention, of, using, it, to, color, their, bodies, red, hematite, powder, was, also, found, scattered, around, the, remains, at, a, grave, site, in, a, zhoukoudian, cave, complex, near, beijing, the, site, has, evidence, of, habitation, as, early, as, 700, 000, years, ago, the, hematite, might, have, been, used, to, symbolize, blood, in, an, offering, to, the, dead, 4, red, black, and, white, were, the, first, colors, used, by, artists, in, the, upper, paleolithic, age, probably, because, natural, pigments, such, as, red, ochre, and, iron, oxide, were, readily, available, where, early, people, lived, madder, a, plant, whose, root, could, be, made, into, a, red, dye, grew, widely, in, europe, africa, and, asia, the, cave, of, altamira, in, spain, has, a, painting, of, a, bison, colored, with, red, ochre, that, dates, to, between, 15, 000, and, 16, 500, bc, a, red, dye, called, kermes, was, made, beginning, in, the, neolithic, period, by, drying, and, then, crushing, the, bodies, of, the, females, of, a, tiny, scale, insect, in, the, genus, kermes, primarily, kermes, vermilio, the, insects, live, on, the, sap, of, certain, trees, especially, kermes, oak, trees, near, the, mediterranean, region, jars, of, kermes, have, been, found, in, a, neolithic, cave, burial, at, adaoutse, bouches, du, rh, ne, 230, 31, kermes, from, oak, trees, was, later, used, by, romans, who, imported, it, from, spain, a, different, variety, of, dye, was, made, from, porphyrophora, hamelii, armenian, cochineal, scale, insects, that, lived, on, the, roots, and, stems, of, certain, herbs, it, was, mentioned, in, texts, as, early, as, the, 8th, century, bc, and, it, was, used, by, the, ancient, assyrians, and, persians, 45, in, ancient, egypt, red, was, associated, with, life, health, and, victory, egyptians, would, color, themselves, with, red, ochre, during, celebrations, egyptian, women, used, red, ochre, as, a, cosmetic, to, redden, cheeks, and, lips, and, also, used, henna, to, color, their, hair, and, paint, their, nails, the, ancient, romans, wore, togas, with, red, stripes, on, holidays, and, the, bride, at, a, wedding, wore, a, red, shawl, called, a, flammeum, 46, red, was, used, to, color, statues, and, the, skin, of, gladiators, red, was, also, the, color, associated, with, army, roman, soldiers, wore, red, tunics, and, officers, wore, a, cloak, called, a, paludamentum, which, depending, upon, the, quality, of, the, dye, could, be, crimson, scarlet, or, purple, in, roman, mythology, red, is, associated, with, the, god, of, war, mars, the, vexilloid, of, the, roman, empire, had, a, red, background, with, the, letters, spqr, in, gold, a, roman, general, receiving, a, triumph, had, his, entire, body, painted, red, in, honor, of, his, achievement, the, romans, liked, bright, colors, and, many, roman, villas, were, decorated, with, vivid, red, murals, the, pigment, used, for, many, of, the, murals, was, called, vermilion, and, it, came, from, the, mineral, cinnabar, a, common, ore, of, mercury, it, was, one, of, the, finest, reds, of, ancient, times, the, paintings, have, retained, their, brightness, for, more, than, twenty, centuries, the, source, of, cinnabar, for, the, romans, was, a, group, of, mines, near, almad, n, southwest, of, madrid, in, spain, working, in, the, mines, was, extremely, dangerous, since, mercury, is, highly, toxic, the, miners, were, slaves, or, prisoners, and, being, sent, to, the, cinnabar, mines, was, a, virtual, death, sentence, after, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, red, was, adopted, as, a, color, of, majesty, and, authority, by, the, byzantine, empire, and, the, princes, of, europe, it, also, played, an, important, part, in, the, rituals, of, the, roman, catholic, church, symbolizing, the, blood, of, christ, and, the, christian, martyrs, in, western, europe, emperor, charlemagne, painted, his, palace, red, as, a, very, visible, symbol, of, his, authority, and, wore, red, shoes, at, his, coronation, 36, 37, kings, princes, and, beginning, in, 1295, roman, catholic, cardinals, began, to, wear, red, colored, habitus, when, abbe, suger, rebuilt, saint, denis, basilica, outside, paris, in, the, early, 12th, century, he, added, stained, glass, windows, colored, blue, cobalt, glass, and, red, glass, tinted, with, copper, together, they, flooded, the, basilica, with, a, mystical, light, soon, stained, glass, windows, were, being, added, to, cathedrals, all, across, france, england, and, germany, in, medieval, painting, red, was, used, to, attract, attention, to, the, most, important, figures, both, christ, and, the, virgin, mary, were, commonly, painted, wearing, red, mantles, in, western, countries, red, is, a, symbol, of, martyrs, and, sacrifice, particularly, because, of, its, association, with, blood, beginning, in, the, middle, ages, the, pope, and, cardinals, of, the, roman, catholic, church, wore, red, to, symbolize, the, blood, of, christ, and, the, christian, martyrs, the, banner, of, the, christian, soldiers, in, the, first, crusade, was, a, red, cross, on, a, white, field, the, st, george, s, cross, according, to, christian, tradition, saint, george, was, a, roman, soldier, who, was, a, member, of, the, guards, of, the, emperor, diocletian, who, refused, to, renounce, his, christian, faith, and, was, martyred, the, saint, george, s, cross, became, the, flag, of, england, in, the, 16th, century, and, now, is, part, of, the, union, flag, of, the, united, kingdom, as, well, as, the, flag, of, the, republic, of, georgia, 36, in, renaissance, painting, red, was, used, to, draw, the, attention, of, the, viewer, it, was, often, used, as, the, color, of, the, cloak, or, costume, of, christ, the, virgin, mary, or, another, central, figure, in, venice, titian, was, the, master, of, fine, reds, particularly, vermilion, he, used, many, layers, of, pigment, mixed, with, a, semi, transparent, glaze, which, let, the, light, pass, through, to, create, a, more, luminous, color, the, figures, of, god, the, virgin, mary, and, two, apostles, are, highlighted, by, their, vermilion, red, costumes, queen, elizabeth, i, of, england, liked, to, wear, bright, reds, before, she, adopted, the, more, sober, image, of, the, virgin, queen, red, costumes, were, not, limited, to, the, upper, classes, in, renaissance, flanders, people, of, all, social, classes, wore, red, at, celebrations, one, such, celebration, was, captured, in, the, wedding, dance, 1566, by, pieter, bruegel, the, elder, the, painter, johannes, vermeer, skilfully, used, different, shades, and, tints, of, vermilion, to, paint, the, red, skirt, in, the, girl, with, the, wine, glass, then, glazed, it, with, madder, lake, to, make, a, more, luminous, color, in, latin, america, the, aztec, people, the, paracas, culture, and, other, societies, used, cochineal, a, vivid, scarlet, dye, made, from, insects, from, the, 16th, until, the, 19th, century, cochineal, became, a, highly, profitable, export, from, spanish, mexico, to, europe, in, the, 18th, century, red, began, to, take, on, a, new, identity, as, the, color, of, resistance, and, revolution, it, was, already, associated, with, blood, and, with, danger, a, red, flag, hoisted, before, a, battle, meant, that, no, prisoners, would, be, taken, in, 1793, 94, red, became, the, color, of, the, french, revolution, a, red, phrygian, cap, or, liberty, cap, was, part, of, the, uniform, of, the, sans, culottes, the, most, militant, faction, of, the, revolutionaries, in, the, late, 18th, century, during, a, strike, english, dock, workers, carried, red, flags, and, it, thereafter, became, closely, associated, with, the, new, labour, movement, and, later, with, the, labour, party, in, the, united, kingdom, founded, in, 1900, in, paris, in, 1832, a, red, flag, was, carried, by, working, class, demonstrators, in, the, failed, june, rebellion, an, event, immortalised, in, les, mis, rables, and, later, in, the, 1848, french, revolution, the, red, flag, was, proposed, as, the, new, national, french, flag, during, the, 1848, revolution, but, was, rejected, by, at, the, urging, of, the, poet, and, statesman, alphonse, lamartine, in, favour, of, the, tricolor, flag, it, appeared, again, as, the, flag, of, the, short, lived, paris, commune, in, 1871, it, was, then, adopted, by, karl, marx, and, the, new, european, movements, of, socialism, and, communism, soviet, russia, adopted, a, red, flag, following, the, bolshevik, revolution, in, 1917, the, people, s, republic, of, china, adopted, the, red, flag, following, the, chinese, communist, revolution, it, was, adopted, by, north, vietnam, in, 1954, and, by, all, of, vietnam, in, 1975, surveys, show, that, red, is, the, color, most, associated, with, courage, 43, in, western, countries, red, is, a, symbol, of, martyrs, and, sacrifice, particularly, because, of, its, association, with, blood, beginning, in, the, middle, ages, the, pope, and, cardinals, of, the, roman, catholic, church, wore, red, to, symbolize, the, blood, of, christ, and, the, christian, martyrs, the, banner, of, the, christian, soldiers, in, the, first, crusade, was, a, red, cross, on, a, white, field,

well, as, the, flag, of, the, republic, of, georgia, 36, while, red, is, the, color, most, associated, with, love, it, also, the, color, most, frequently, associated, with, hatred, anger, aggression, and, war, people, who, are, angry, are, said, to, see, red, red, is, the, color, most, commonly, associated, with, passion, and, heat, in, ancient, rome, red, was, the, color, of, mars, the, god, of, war, the, planet, mars, was, named, for, him, because, of, its, red, color, 42, 53, red, is, the, traditional, color, of, warning, and, danger, and, is, therefore, often, used, on, flags, in, the,
