chlorine, is, a, chemical, element, it, has, symbol, cl, and, atomic, number, 17, the, second, lightest, of, the, halogens, it, appears, between, fluorine, and, bromine, in, the, periodic, table, and, its, properties, are, mostly, intermediate, between, them, chlorine, is, a, yellow, green, gas, at, room, temperature, it, is, an, extremely, reactive, element, and, a, strong, oxidising, agent, among, the, elements, it, has, the, highest, electron, affinity, and, the, third, highest, electronegativity, on, the, revised, pauling, scale, behind, only, oxygen, and, fluorine, chlorine, played, an, important, role, in, the, experiments, conducted, by, medieval, alchemists, which, commonly, involved, the, heating, of, chloride, salts, like, ammonium, chloride, sal, ammoniac, and, sodium, chloride, common, salt, producing, various, chemical, substances, containing, chlorine, such, as, hydrogen, chloride, mercury, ii, chloride, corrosive, sublimate, and, aqua, regia, however, the, nature, of, free, chlorine, gas, as, a, separate, substance, was, only, recognised, around, 1630, by, jan, baptist, van, helmont, carl, wilhelm, scheele, wrote, a, description, of, chlorine, gas, in, 1774, supposing, it, to, be, an, oxide, of, a, new, element, in, 1809, chemists, suggested, that, the, gas, might, be, a, pure, element, and, this, was, confirmed, by, sir, humphry, davy, in, 1810, who, named, it, after, the, ancient, greek, khl, r, s, pale, green, because, of, its, colour, because, of, its, great, reactivity, all, chlorine, in, the, earth, s, crust, is, in, the, form, of, ionic, chloride, compounds, which, includes, table, salt, it, is, the, second, most, abundant, halogen, after, fluorine, and, 20th, most, abundant, element, in, earth, s, crust, these, crystal, deposits, are, nevertheless, dwarfed, by, the, huge, reserves, of, chloride, in, seawater, elemental, chlorine, is, commercially, produced, from, brine, by, electrolysis, predominantly, in, the, chloralkali, process, the, high, oxidising, potential, of, elemental, chlorine, led, to, the, development, of, commercial, bleaches, and, disinfectants, and, a, reagent, for, many, processes, in, the, chemical, industry, chlorine, is, used, in, the, manufacture, of, a, wide, range, of, consumer, products, about, two, thirds, of, them, organic, chemicals, such, as, polyvinyl, chloride, pvc, many, intermediates, for, the, production, of, plastics, and, other, end, products, which, do, not, contain, the, element, as, a, common, disinfectant, elemental, chlorine, and, chlorine, generating, compounds, are, used, more, directly, in, swimming, pools, to, keep, them, sanitary, elemental, chlorine, at, high, concentration, is, extremely, dangerous, and, poisonous, to, most, living, organisms, as, a, chemical, warfare, agent, chlorine, was, first, used, in, world, war, i, as, a, poison, gas, weapon, in, the, form, of, chloride, ions, chlorine, is, necessary, to, all, known, species, of, life, other, types, of, chlorine, compounds, are, rare, in, living, organisms, and, artificially, produced, chlorinated, organics, range, from, inert, to, toxic, in, the, upper, atmosphere, chlorine, containing, organic, molecules, such, as, chlorofluorocarbons, have, been, implicated, in, ozone, depletion, small, quantities, of, elemental, chlorine, are, generated, by, oxidation, of, chloride, ions, in, neutrophils, as, part, of, an, immune, system, response, against, bacteria, the, most, common, compound, of, chlorine, sodium, chloride, has, been, known, since, ancient, times, archaeologists, have, found, evidence, that, rock, salt, was, used, as, early, as, 3000, bc, and, brine, as, early, as, 6000, bc, around, 900, the, authors, of, the, arabic, writings, attributed, to, jabir, ibn, hayyan, latin, geber, and, the, persian, physician, and, alchemist, abu, bakr, al, razi, c, 865, 925, latin, rhazes, were, experimenting, with, sal, ammoniac, ammonium, chloride, which, when, it, was, distilled, together, with, vitriol, hydrated, sulfates, of, various, metals, produced, hydrogen, chloride, however, it, appears, that, in, these, early, experiments, with, chloride, salts, the, gaseous, products, were, discarded, and, hydrogen, chloride, may, have, been, produced, many, times, before, it, was, discovered, that, it, can, be, put, to, chemical, use, one, of, the, first, such, uses, was, the, synthesis, of, mercury, ii, chloride, corrosive, sublimate, whose, production, from, the, heating, of, mercury, either, with, alum, and, ammonium, chloride, or, with, vitriol, and, sodium, chloride, was, first, described, in, the, de, aluminibus, et, salibus, on, alums, and, salts, an, eleventh, or, twelfth, century, arabic, text, falsely, attributed, to, abu, bakr, al, razi, and, translated, into, latin, in, the, second, half, of, the, twelfth, century, by, gerard, of, cremona, 1144, 1187, another, important, development, was, the, discovery, by, pseudo, geber, in, the, de, inventione, veritatis, on, the, discovery, of, truth, after, c, 1300, that, by, adding, ammonium, chloride, to, nitric, acid, a, strong, solvent, capable, of, dissolving, gold, i, e, aqua, regia, could, be, produced, although, aqua, regia, is, an, unstable, mixture, that, continually, gives, off, fumes, containing, free, chlorine, gas, this, chlorine, gas, appears, to, have, been, ignored, until, c, 1630, when, its, nature, as, a, separate, gaseous, substance, was, recognised, by, the, brabantian, chemist, and, physician, jan, baptist, van, helmont, the, element, was, first, studied, in, detail, in, 1774, by, swedish, chemist, carl, wilhelm, scheele, and, he, is, credited, with, the, discovery, scheele, produced, chlorine, by, reacting, mno, 2, as, the, mineral, pyrolusite, with, hcl, scheele, observed, several, of, the, properties, of, chlorine, the, bleaching, effect, on, litmus, the, deadly, effect, on, insects, the, yellow, green, colour, and, the, smell, similar, to, aqua, regia, he, called, it, dephlogisticated, muriatic, acid, air, since, it, is, a, gas, then, called, airs, and, it, came, from, hydrochloric, acid, then, known, as, muriatic, acid, he, failed, to, establish, chlorine, as, an, element, common, chemical, theory, at, that, time, held, that, an, acid, is, a, compound, that, contains, oxygen, remnants, of, this, survive, in, the, german, and, dutch, names, of, oxygen, sauerstoff, or, zuurstof, both, translating, into, english, as, acid, substance, so, a, number, of, chemists, including, claude, berthollet, suggested, that, scheele, s, dephlogisticated, muriatic, acid, air, must, be, a, combination, of, oxygen, and, the, yet, undiscovered, element, muriaticum, in, 1809, joseph, louis, gay, lussac, and, louis, jacques, th, nard, tried, to, decompose, dephlogisticated, muriatic, acid, air, by, reacting, it, with, charcoal, to, release, the, free, element, muriaticum, and, carbon, dioxide, they, did, not, succeed, and, published, a, report, in, which, they, considered, the, possibility, that, dephlogisticated, muriatic, acid, air, is, an, element, but, were, not, convinced, in, 1810, sir, humphry, davy, tried, the, same, experiment, again, and, concluded, that, the, substance, was, an, element, and, not, a, compound, he, announced, his, results, to, the, royal, society, on, 15, november, that, year, at, that, time, he, named, this, new, element, chlorine, from, the, greek, word, chl, ros, green, yellow, in, reference, to, its, colour, the, name, halogen, meaning, salt, producer, was, originally, used, for, chlorine, in, 1811, by, johann, salomo, christoph, schweigger, this, term, was, later, used, as, a, generic, term, to, describe, all, the, elements, in, the, chlorine, family, fluorine, bromine, iodine, after, a, suggestion, by, j, ns, jakob, berzelius, in, 1826, in, 1823, michael, faraday, liquefied, chlorine, for, the, first, time, and, demonstrated, that, what, was, then, known, as, solid, chlorine, had, a, structure, of, chlorine, hydrate, cl, 2, h, 2, o, chlorine, gas, was, first, used, by, french, chemist, claude, berthollet, to, bleach, textiles, in, 1785, modern, bleaches, resulted, from, further, work, by, berthollet, who, first, produced, sodium, hypochlorite, in, 1789, in, his, laboratory, in, the, town, of, javel, now, part, of, paris, france, by, passing, chlorine, gas, through, a, solution, of, sodium, carbonate, the, resulting, liquid, known, as, eau, de, javel, javel, water, was, a, weak, solution, of, sodium, hypochlorite, this, process, was, not, very, efficient, and, alternative, production, methods, were, sought, scottish, chemist, and, industrialist, charles, tennant, first, produced, a, solution, of, calcium, hypochlorite, chlorinated, lime, then, solid, calcium, hypochlorite, bleaching, powder, these, compounds, produced, low, levels, of, elemental, chlorine, and, could, be, more, efficiently, transported, than, sodium, hypochlorite, which, remained, as, dilute, solutions, because, when, purified, to, eliminate, water, it, became, a, dangerously, powerful, and, unstable, oxidizer, near, the, end, of, the, nineteenth, century, e, s, smith, patented, a, method, of, sodium, hypochlorite, production, involving, electrolysis, of, brine, to, produce, sodium, hydroxide, and, chlorine, gas, which, then, mixed, to, form, sodium, hypochlorite, this, is, known, as, the, chloralkali, process, first, introduced, on, an, industrial, scale, in, 1892, and, now, the, source, of, most, elemental, chlorine, and, sodium, hydroxide, in, 1884, chemischen, fabrik, griesheim, of, germany, developed, another, chloralkali, process, which, entered, commercial, production, in, 1888, elemental, chlorine, solutions, dissolved, in, chemically, basic, water, sodium, and, calcium, hypochlorite, were, first, used, as, anti, putrefaction, agents, and, disinfectants, in, the, 1820s, in, france, long, before, the, establishment, of, the, germ, theory, of, disease, this, practice, was, pioneered, by, antoine, germain, labarraque, who, adapted, berthollet, s, javel, water, bleach, and, other, chlorine, preparations, elemental, chlorine, has, since, served, a, continuous, function, in, topical, antisepsis, wound, irrigation, solutions, and, the, like, and, public, sanitation, particularly, in, swimming, and, drinking, water, chlorine, gas, was, first, used, as, a, weapon, on, april, 22, 1915, at, the, second, battle, of, ypres, by, the, german, army, the, effect, on, the, allies, was, devastating, because, the, existing, gas, masks, were, difficult, to, deploy, and, had, not, been, broadly, distributed, chlorine, is, the, second, halogen, being, a, nonmetal, in, group, 17, of, the, periodic, table, its, properties, are, thus, similar, to, fluorine, bromine, and, iodine, and, are, largely, intermediate, between, those, of, the, first, two, chlorine, has, the, electron, configuration, 3s, 2, 3p, 5, with, the, seven, electrons, in, the, third, and, outermost, shell, acting, as, its, valence, electrons, like, all, halogens, it, is, thus, one, electron, short, of, a, full, octet, and, is, hence, a, strong, oxidising, agent, reacting, with, many, elements, in, order, to, complete, its, outer, shell, corresponding, to, periodic, trends, it, is, intermediate, in, electronegativity, between, fluorine, and, bromine, f, 3, 98, cl, 3, 16, br, 2, 96, i, 2, 66, and, is, less, reactive, than, fluorine, and, more, reactive, than, bromine, it, is, also, a, weaker, oxidising, agent, than, fluorine, but, a, stronger, one, than, bromine, conversely, the, chloride, ion, is, a, weaker, reducing, agent, than, bromide, but, a, stronger, one, than, fluoride, it, is, intermediate, in, atomic, radius, between, fluorine, and, bromine, and, this, leads, to, many, of, its, atomic, properties, similarly, continuing, the, trend, from, iodine, to, bromine, upward, such, as, first, ionisation, energy, electron, affinity, enthalpy, of, dissociation, of, the, x, 2, molecule, x, cl, br, i, ionic, radius, and, x, x, bond, length, fluorine, is, anomalous, due, to, its, small, size, all, four, stable, halogens, experience, intermolecular, van, der, waals, forces, of, attraction, and, their, strength, increases, together, with, the, number, of, electrons, among, all, homonuclear, diatomic, halogen, molecules, thus, the, melting, and, boiling, points, of, chlorine, are, intermediate, between, those, of, fluorine, and, bromine, chlorine, melts, at, 101, 0, c, and, boils, at, 34, 0, c, as, a, result, of, the, increasing, molecular, weight, of, the, halogens, down, the, group, the, density, and, heats, of, fusion, and, vaporisation, of, chlorine, are, again, intermediate, between, those, of, bromine, and, fluorine, although, all, their, heats, of, vaporisation, are, fairly, low, leading, to, high, volatility, thanks, to, their, diatomic, molecular, structure, the, halogens, darken, in, colour, as, the, group, is, descended, thus, while, fluorine, is, a, pale, yellow, gas, chlorine, is, distinctly, yellow, green, this, trend, occurs, because, the, wavelengths, of, visible, light, absorbed, by, the, halogens, increase, down, the, group, specifically, the, colour, of, a, halogen, such, as, chlorine, results, from, the, electron, transition, between, the, highest, occupied, antibonding, g, molecular, orbital, and, the, lowest, vacant, antibonding, u, molecular, orbital, the, colour, fades, at, low, temperatures, so, that, solid, chlorine, at, 195, c, is, almost, colourless, like, solid, bromine, and, iodine, solid, chlorine, crystallises, in, the, orthorhombic, crystal, system, in, a, layered, lattice, of, cl, 2, molecules, the, cl, cl, distance, is, 198, pm, close, to, the, gaseous, cl, cl, distance, of, 199, pm, and, the, cl, cl, distance, between, molecules, is, 332, pm, within, a, layer, and, 382, pm, between, layers, compare, the, van, der, waals, radius, of, chlorine, 180, pm, this, structure, means, that, chlorine, is, a, very, poor, conductor, of, electricity, and, indeed, its, conductivity, is, so, low, as, to, be, practically, unmeasurable, chlorine, has, two, stable, isotopes, 35, cl, and, 37, cl, these, are, its, only, two, natural, isotopes, occurring, in, quantity, with, 35, cl, making, up, 76, of, natural, chlorine, and, 37, cl, making, up, the, remaining, 24, both, are, synthesised, in, stars, in, the, oxygen, burning, and, silicon, burning, processes, both, have, nuclear, spin, 3, 2, and, thus, may, be, used, for, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, although, the, spin, magnitude, being, greater, than, 1, 2, results, in, non, spherical, nuclear, charge, distribution, and, thus, resonance, broadening, as, a, result, of, a, nonzero, nuclear, quadrupole, moment, and, resultant, quadrupolar, relaxation, the, other, chlorine, isotopes, are, all, radioactive, with, half, lives, too, short, to, occur, in, nature, primordially, of, these, the, most, commonly, used, in, the, laboratory, are, 36, cl, t, 1, 2, 3, 0, 10, 5, y, and, 38, cl, t, 1, 2, 37, 2, min, which, may, be, produced, from, the, neutron, activation, of, natural, chlorine, the, most, stable, chlorine, radioisotope, is, 36, cl, the, primary, decay, mode, of, isotopes, lighter, than, 35, cl, is, electron, capture, to, isotopes, of, sulfur, that, of, isotopes, heavier, than, 37, cl, is, beta, decay, to, isotopes, of, argon, and, 36, cl, may, decay, by, either, mode, to, stable, 36, s, or, 36, ar, 36, cl, occurs, in, trace, quantities, in, nature, as, a, cosmogenic, nuclide, in, a, ratio, of, about, 7, 10, 10, 13, to, 1, with, stable, chlorine, isotopes, it, is, produced, in, the, atmosphere, by, spallation, of, 36, ar, by, interactions, with, cosmic, ray, protons, in, the, top, meter, of, the, lithosphere, 36, cl, is, generated, primarily, by, thermal, neutron, activation, of, 35, cl, and, spallation, of, 39, k, and, 40, ca, in, the, subsurface, environment, muon, capture, by, 40, ca, becomes, more, important, as, a, way, to, generate, 36, cl, chlorine, is, intermediate, in, reactivity, between, fluorine, and, bromine, and, is, one, of, the, most, reactive, elements, chlorine, is, a, weaker, oxidising, agent, than, fluorine, but, a, stronger, one, than, bromine, or, iodine, this, can, be, seen, from, the, standard, electrode, potentials, of, the, x, 2, x, couples, f, 2, 866, v, cl, 1, 395, v, br, 1, 087, v, i, 0, 615, v, at, approximately, 0, 3, v, however, this, trend, is, not, shown, in, the, bond, energies, because, fluorine, is, singular, due, to, its, small, size, low, polarisability, and, inability, to, show, hypervalence, as, another, difference, chlorine, has, a, significant, chemistry, in, positive, oxidation, states, while, fluorine, does, not, chlorination, often, leads, to, higher, oxidation, states, than, bromination, or, iodination, but, lower, oxidation, states, than, fluorination, chlorine, tends, to, react, with, compounds, including, m, m, m, h, or, m, c, bonds, to, form, m, cl, bonds, given, that, e, 1, 2, o, 2, h, 2, o, 1, 229, v, which, is, less, than, 1, 395, v, it, would, be, expected, that, chlorine, should, be, able, to, oxidise, water, to, oxygen, and, hydrochloric, acid, however, the, kinetics, of, this, reaction, are, unfavorable, and, there, is, also, a, bubble, overpotential, effect, to, consider, so, that, electrolysis, of, aqueous, chloride, solutions, evolves, chlorine, gas, and, not, oxygen, gas, a, fact, that, is, very, useful, for, the, industrial, production, of, chlorine, the, simplest, chlorine, compound, is, hydrogen, chloride, hcl, a, major, chemical, in, industry, as, well, as, in, the, laboratory, both, as, a, gas, and, dissolved, in, water, as, hydrochloric, acid, it, is, often, produced, by, burning, hydrogen, gas, in, chlorine, gas, or, as, a, byproduct, of, chlorinating, hydrocarbons, another, approach, is, to, treat, sodium, chloride, with, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, to, produce, hydrochloric, acid, also, known, as, the, salt, cake, process, in, the, laboratory, hydrogen, chloride, gas, may, be, made, by, drying, the, acid, with, concentrated, sulfuric, acid, deuterium, chloride, dcl, may, be, produced, by, reacting, benzoyl, chloride, with, heavy, water, d, 2, o, at, room, temperature, hydrogen, chloride, is, a, colourless, gas, like, all, the, hydrogen, halides, apart, from, hydrogen, fluoride, since, hydrogen, cannot, form, strong, hydrogen, bonds, to, the, larger, electronegative, chlorine, atom, however, weak, hydrogen, bonding, is, present, in, solid, crystalline, hydrogen, chloride, at, low, temperatures, similar, to, the, hydrogen, fluoride, structure, before, disorder, begins, to, prevail, as, the, temperature, is, raised, hydrochloric, acid, is, a, strong, acid, p, k, a, 7, because, the, hydrogen, bonds, to, chlorine, are, too, weak, to, inhibit, dissociation, the, hcl, h, 2, o, system, has, many, hydrates, hcl, n, h, 2, o, for, n, 1, 2, 3, 4, and, 6, beyond, a, 1, 1, mixture, of, hcl, and, h, 2, o, the, system, separates, completely, into, two, separate, liquid, phases, hydrochloric, acid, forms, an, azeotrope, with, boiling, point, 108, 58, c, at, 20, 22, g, hcl, per, 100, g, solution, thus, hydrochloric, acid, cannot, be, concentrated, beyond, this, point, by, distillation, unlike, hydrogen, fluoride, anhydrous, liquid, hydrogen, chloride, is, difficult, to, work, with, as, a, solvent, because, its, boiling, point, is, low, it, has, a, small, liquid, range, its, dielectric, constant, is, low, and, it, does, not, dissociate, appreciably, into, h, 2, cl, and, hcl, 2, ions, the, latter, in, any, case, are, much, less, stable, than, the, bifluoride, ions, hf, 2, due, to, the, very, weak, hydrogen, bonding, between, hydrogen, and, chlorine, though, its, salts, with, very, large, and, weakly, polarising, cations, such, as, cs, and, nr, 4, r, me, et, bu, n, may, still, be, isolated, anhydrous, hydrogen, chloride, is, a, poor, solvent, only, able, to, dissolve, small, molecular, compounds, such, as, nitrosyl, chloride, and, phenol, or, salts, with, very, low, lattice, energies, such, as, tetraalkylammonium, halides, it, readily, protonates, electrophiles, containing, lone, pairs, or, bonds, solvolysis, ligand, replacement, reactions, and, oxidations, are, well, characterised, in, hydrogen, chloride, solution, nearly, all, elements, in, the, periodic, table, form, binary, chlorides, the, exceptions, are, decidedly, in, the, minority, and, stem, in, each, case, from, one, of, three, causes, extreme, inertness, and, reluctance, to, participate, in, chemical, reactions, the, noble, gases, with, the, exception, of, xenon, in, the, highly, unstable, xecl, 2, and, xecl, 4, extreme, nuclear, instability, hampering, chemical, investigation, before, decay, and, transmutation, many, of, the, heaviest, elements, beyond, bismuth, and, having, an, electronegativity, higher, than, chlorine, s, oxygen, and, fluorine, so, that, the, resultant, binary, compounds, are, formally, not, chlorides, but, rather, oxides, or, fluorides, of, chlorine, even, though, nitrogen, in, ncl, 3, is, bearing, a, negative, charge, the, compound, is, usually, called, nitrogen, trichloride, chlorination, of, metals, with, cl, 2, usually, leads, to, a, higher, oxidation, state, than, bromination, with, br, 2, when, multiple, oxidation, states, are, available, such, as, in, mocl, 5, and, mobr, 3, chlorides, can, be, made, by, reaction, of, an, element, or, its, oxide, hydroxide, or, carbonate, with, hydrochloric, acid, and, then, dehydrated, by, mildly, high, temperatures, combined, with, either, low, pressure, or, anhydrous, hydrogen, chloride, gas, these, methods, work, best, when, the, chloride, product, is, stable, to, hydrolysis, otherwise, the, possibilities, include, high, temperature, oxidative, chlorination, of, the, element, with, chlorine, or, hydrogen, chloride, high, temperature, chlorination, of, a, metal, oxide, or, other, halide, by, chlorine, a, volatile, metal, chloride, carbon, tetrachloride, or, an, organic, chloride, for, instance, zirconium, dioxide, reacts, with, chlorine, at, standard, conditions, to, produce, zirconium, tetrachloride, and, uranium, trioxide, reacts, with, hexachloropropene, when, heated, under, reflux, to, give, uranium, tetrachloride, the, second, example, also, involves, a, reduction, in, oxidation, state, which, can, also, be, achieved, by, reducing, a, higher, chloride, using, hydrogen, or, a, metal, as, a, reducing, agent, this, may, also, be, achieved, by, thermal, decomposition, or, disproportionation, as, follows, most, metal, chlorides, with, the, metal, in, low, oxidation, states, 1, to, 3, are, ionic, nonmetals, tend, to, form, covalent, molecular, chlorides, as, do, metals, in, high, oxidation, states, from, 3, and, above, both, ionic, and, covalent, chlorides, are, known, for, metals, in, oxidation, state, 3, e, g, scandium, chloride, is, mostly, ionic, but, aluminium, chloride, is, not, silver, chloride, is, very, insoluble, in, water, and, is, thus, often, used, as, a, qualitative, test, for, chlorine, although, dichlorine, is, a, strong, oxidising, agent, with, a, high, first, ionisation, energy, it, may, be, oxidised, under, extreme, conditions, to, form, the, cation, this, is, very, unstable, and, has, only, been, characterised, by, its, electronic, band, spectrum, when, produced, in, a, low, pressure, discharge, tube, the, yellow, cation, is, more, stable, and, may, be, produced, as, follows, this, reaction, is, conducted, in, the, oxidising, solvent, arsenic, pentafluoride, the, trichloride, anion, has, also, been, characterised, it, is, analogous, to, triiodide, the, three, fluorides, of, chlorine, form, a, subset, of, the, interhalogen, compounds, all, of, which, are, diamagnetic, some, cationic, and, anionic, derivatives, are, known, such, as, clf, 2, clf, 4, clf, 2, and, cl, 2, f, some, pseudohalides, of, chlorine, are, also, known, such, as, cyanogen, chloride, clcn, linear, chlorine, cyanate, clnco, chlorine, thiocyanate, clscn, unlike, its, oxygen, counterpart, and, chlorine, azide, cln, 3, chlorine, monofluoride, clf, is, extremely, thermally, stable, and, is, sold, commercially, in, 500, gram, steel, lecture, bottles, it, is, a, colourless, gas, that, melts, at, 155, 6, c, and, boils, at, 100, 1, c, it, may, be, produced, by, the, reaction, of, its, elements, at, 225, c, though, it, must, then, be, separated, and, purified, from, chlorine, trifluoride, and, its, reactants, its, properties, are, mostly, intermediate, between, those, of, chlorine, and, fluorine, it, will, react, with, many, metals, and, nonmetals, from, room, temperature, and, above, fluorinating, them, and, liberating, chlorine, it, will, also, act, as, a, chlorofluorinating, agent, adding, chlorine, and, fluorine, across, a, multiple, bond, or, by, oxidation, for, example, it, will, attack, carbon, monoxide, to, form, carbonyl, chlorofluoride, cofcl, it, will, react, analogously, with, hexafluoroacetone, cf, 3, 2, co, with, a, potassium, fluoride, catalyst, to, produce, heptafluoroisopropyl, hypochlorite, cf, 3, 2, cfocl, with, nitriles, rcn, to, produce, rcf, 2, ncl, 2, and, with, the, sulfur, oxides, so, 2, and, so, 3, to, produce, clso, 2, f, and, closo, 2, f, respectively, it, will, also, react, exothermically, with, compounds, containing, oh, and, nh, groups, such, as, water, chlorine, trifluoride, clf, 3, is, a, volatile, colourless, molecular, liquid, which, melts, at, 76, 3, c, and, boils, at, 11, 8, c, it, may, be, formed, by, directly, fluorinating, gaseous, chlorine, or, chlorine, monofluoride, at, 200, 300, c, one, of, the, most, reactive, chemical, compounds, known, the, list, of, elements, it, sets, on, fire, is, diverse, containing, hydrogen, potassium, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, sulfur, selenium, tellurium, bromine, iodine, and, powdered, molybdenum, tungsten, rhodium, iridium, and, iron, it, will, also, ignite, water, along, with, many, substances, which, in, ordinary, circumstances, would, be, considered, chemically, inert, such, as, asbestos, concrete, glass, and, sand, when, heated, it, will, even, corrode, noble, metals, as, palladium, platinum, and, gold, and, even, the, noble, gases, xenon, and, radon, do, not, escape, fluorination, an, impermeable, fluoride, layer, is, formed, by, sodium, magnesium, aluminium, zinc, tin, and, silver, which, may, be, removed, by, heating, nickel, copper, and, steel, containers, are, usually, used, due, to, their, great, resistance, to, attack, by, chlorine, trifluoride, stemming, from, the, formation, of, an, unreactive, layer, of, metal, fluoride, its, reaction, with, hydrazine, to, form, hydrogen, fluoride, nitrogen, and, chlorine, gases, was, used, in, experimental, rocket, engine, but, has, problems, largely, stemming, from, its, extreme, hypergolicity, resulting, in, ignition, without, any, measurable, delay, today, it, is, mostly, used, in, nuclear, fuel, processing, to, oxidise, uranium, to, uranium, hexafluoride, for, its, enriching, and, to, separate, it, from, plutonium, as, well, as, in, the, semiconductor, industry, where, it, is, used, to, clean, chemical, vapor, deposition, chambers, it, can, act, as, a, fluoride, ion, donor, or, acceptor, lewis, base, or, acid, although, it, does, not, dissociate, appreciably, into, clf, 2, and, clf, 4, ions, chlorine, pentafluoride, clf, 5, is, made, on, a, large, scale, by, direct, fluorination, of, chlorine, with, excess, fluorine, gas, at, 350, c, and, 250, atm, and, on, a, small, scale, by, reacting, metal, chlorides, with, fluorine, gas, at, 100, 300, c, it, melts, at, 103, c, and, boils, at, 13, 1, c, it, is, a, very, strong, fluorinating, agent, although, it, is, still, not, as, effective, as, chlorine, trifluoride, only, a, few, specific, stoichiometric, reactions, have, been, characterised, arsenic, pentafluoride, and, antimony, pentafluoride, form, ionic, adducts, of, the, form, m, as, sb, and, water, reacts, vigorously, as, follows, the, product, chloryl, fluoride, is, one, of, the, five, known, chlorine, oxide, fluorides, these, range, from, the, thermally, unstable, fclo, to, the, chemically, unreactive, perchloryl, fluoride, fclo, 3, the, other, three, being, fclo, 2, f, 3, clo, and, f, 3, clo, 2, all, five, behave, similarly, to, the, chlorine, fluorides, both, structurally, and, chemically, and, may, act, as, lewis, acids, or, bases, by, gaining, or, losing, fluoride, ions, respectively, or, as, very, strong, oxidising, and, fluorinating, agents, the, chlorine, oxides, are, well, studied, in, spite, of, their, instability, all, of, them, are, endothermic, compounds, they, are, important, because, they, are, produced, when, chlorofluorocarbons, undergo, photolysis, in, the, upper, atmosphere, and, cause, the, destruction, of, the, ozone, layer, none, of, them, can, be, made, from, directly, reacting, the, elements, dichlorine, monoxide, cl, 2, o, is, a, brownish, yellow, gas, red, brown, when, solid, or, liquid, which, may, be, obtained, by, reacting, chlorine, gas, with, yellow, mercury, ii, oxide, it, is, very, soluble, in, water, in, which, it, is, in, equilibrium, with, hypochlorous, acid, hocl, of, which, it, is, the, anhydride, it, is, thus, an, effective, bleach, and, is, mostly, used, to, make, hypochlorites, it, explodes, on, heating, or, sparking, or, in, the, presence, of, ammonia, gas, chlorine, dioxide, clo, 2, was, the, first, chlorine, oxide, to, be, discovered, in, 1811, by, humphry, davy, it, is, a, yellow, paramagnetic, gas, deep, red, as, a, solid, or, liquid, as, expected, from, its, having, an, odd, number, of, electrons, it, is, stable, towards, dimerisation, due, to, the, delocalisation, of, the, unpaired, electron, it, explodes, above, 40, c, as, a, liquid, and, under, pressure, as, a, gas, and, therefore, must, be, made, at, low, concentrations, for, wood, pulp, bleaching, and, water, treatment, it, is, usually, prepared, by, reducing, a, chlorate, as, follows, its, production, is, thus, intimately, linked, to, the, redox, reactions, of, the, chlorine, oxoacids, it, is, a, strong, oxidising, agent, reacting, with, sulfur, phosphorus, phosphorus, halides, and, potassium, borohydride, it, dissolves, exothermically, in, water, to, form, dark, green, solutions, that, very, slowly, decompose, in, the, dark, crystalline, clathrate, hydrates, clo, 2, n, h, 2, o, n, 6, 10, separate, out, at, low, temperatures, however, in, the, presence, of, light, these, solutions, rapidly, photodecompose, to, form, a, mixture, of, chloric, and, hydrochloric, acids, photolysis, of, individual, clo, 2, molecules, result, in, the, radicals, clo, and, cloo, while, at, room, temperature, mostly, chlorine, oxygen, and, some, clo, 3, and, cl, 2, o, 6, are, produced, cl, 2, o, 3, is, also, produced, when, photolysing, the, solid, at, 78, c, it, is, a, dark, brown, solid, that, explodes, below, 0, c, the, clo, radical, leads, to, the, depletion, of, atmospheric, ozone, and, is, thus, environmentally, important, as, follows, chlorine, perchlorate, cloclo, 3, is, a, pale, yellow, liquid, that, is, less, stable, than, clo, 2, and, decomposes, at, room, temperature, to, form, chlorine, oxygen, and, dichlorine, hexoxide, cl, 2, o, 6, chlorine, perchlorate, may, also, be, considered, a, chlorine, derivative, of, perchloric, acid, hoclo, 3, similar, to, the, thermally, unstable, chlorine, derivatives, of, other, oxoacids, examples, include, chlorine, nitrate, clono, 2, vigorously, reactive, and, explosive, and, chlorine, fluorosulfate, closo, 2, f, more, stable, but, still, moisture, sensitive, and, highly, reactive, dichlorine, hexoxide, is, a, dark, red, liquid, that, freezes, to, form, a, solid, which, turns, yellow, at, 180, c, it, is, usually, made, by, reaction, of, chlorine, dioxide, with, oxygen, despite, attempts, to, rationalise, it, as, the, dimer, of, clo, 3, it, reacts, more, as, though, it, were, chloryl, perchlorate, which, has, been, confirmed, to, be, the, correct, structure, of, the, solid, it, hydrolyses, in, water, to, give, a, mixture, of, chloric, and, perchloric, acids, the, analogous, reaction, with, anhydrous, hydrogen, fluoride, does, not, proceed, to, completion, dichlorine, heptoxide, cl, 2, o, 7, is, the, anhydride, of, perchloric, acid, hclo, 4, and, can, readily, be, obtained, from, it, by, dehydrating, it, with, phosphoric, acid, at, 10, c, and, then, distilling, the, product, at, 35, c, and, 1, mmhg, it, is, a, shock, sensitive, colourless, oily, liquid, it, is, the, least, reactive, of, the, chlorine, oxides, being, the, only, one, to, not, set, organic, materials, on, fire, at, room, temperature, it, may, be, dissolved, in, water, to, regenerate, perchloric, acid, or, in, aqueous, alkalis, to, regenerate, perchlorates, however, it, thermally, decomposes, explosively, by, breaking, one, of, the, central, cl, o, bonds, producing, the, radicals, clo, 3, and, clo, 4, which, immediately, decompose, to, the, elements, through, intermediate, oxides, chlorine, forms, four, oxoacids, hypochlorous, acid, hocl, chlorous, acid, hoclo, chloric, acid, hoclo, 2, and, perchloric, acid, hoclo, 3, as, can, be, seen, from, the, redox, potentials, given, in, the, adjacent, table, chlorine, is, much, more, stable, towards, disproportionation, in, acidic, solutions, than, in, alkaline, solutions, the, hypochlorite, ions, also, disproportionate, further, to, produce, chloride, and, chlorate, 3, clo, 2, cl, clo, 3, but, this, reaction, is, quite, slow, at, temperatures, below, 70, c, in, spite, of, the, very, favourable, equilibrium, constant, of, 10, 27, the, chlorate, ions, may, themselves, disproportionate, to, form, chloride, and, perchlorate, 4, clo, 3, cl, 3, clo, 4, but, this, is, still, very, slow, even, at, 100, c, despite, the, very, favourable, equilibrium, constant, of, 10, 20, the, rates, of, reaction, for, the, chlorine, oxyanions, increases, as, the, oxidation, state, of, chlorine, decreases, the, strengths, of, the, chlorine, oxyacids, increase, very, quickly, as, the, oxidation, state, of, chlorine, increases, due, to, the, increasing, delocalisation, of, charge, over, more, and, more, oxygen, atoms, in, their, conjugate, bases, most, of, the, chlorine, oxoacids, may, be, produced, by, exploiting, these, disproportionation, reactions, hypochlorous, acid, hocl, is, highly, reactive, and, quite, unstable, its, salts, are, mostly, used, for, their, bleaching, and, sterilising, abilities, they, are, very, strong, oxidising, agents, transferring, an, oxygen, atom, to, most, inorganic, species, chlorous, acid, hoclo, is, even, more, unstable, and, cannot, be, isolated, or, concentrated, without, decomposition, it, is, known, from, the, decomposition, of, aqueous, chlorine, dioxide, however, sodium, chlorite, is, a, stable, salt, and, is, useful, for, bleaching, and, stripping, textiles, as, an, oxidising, agent, and, as, a, source, of, chlorine, dioxide, chloric, acid, hoclo, 2, is, a, strong, acid, that, is, quite, stable, in, cold, water, up, to, 30, concentration, but, on, warming, gives, chlorine, and, chlorine, dioxide, evaporation, under, reduced, pressure, allows, it, to, be, concentrated, further, to, about, 40, but, then, it, decomposes, to, perchloric, acid, chlorine, oxygen, water, and, chlorine, dioxide, its, most, important, salt, is, sodium, chlorate, mostly, used, to, make, chlorine, dioxide, to, bleach, paper, pulp, the, decomposition, of, chlorate, to, chloride, and, oxygen, is, a, common, way, to, produce, oxygen, in, the, laboratory, on, a, small, scale, chloride, and, chlorate, may, comproportionate, to, form, chlorine, as, follows, perchlorates, and, perchloric, acid, hoclo, 3, are, the, most, stable, oxo, compounds, of, chlorine, in, keeping, with, the, fact, that, chlorine, compounds, are, most, stable, when, the, chlorine, atom, is, in, its, lowest, 1, or, highest, 7, possible, oxidation, states, perchloric, acid, and, aqueous, perchlorates, are, vigorous, and, sometimes, violent, oxidising, agents, when, heated, in, stark, contrast, to, their, mostly, inactive, nature, at, room, temperature, due, to, the, high, activation, energies, for, these, reactions, for, kinetic, reasons, perchlorates, are, made, by, electrolytically, oxidising, sodium, chlorate, and, perchloric, acid, is, made, by, reacting, anhydrous, sodium, perchlorate, or, barium, perchlorate, with, concentrated, hydrochloric, acid, filtering, away, the, chloride, precipitated, and, distilling, the, filtrate, to, concentrate, it, anhydrous, perchloric, acid, is, a, colourless, mobile, liquid, that, is, sensitive, to, shock, that, explodes, on, contact, with, most, organic, compounds, sets, hydrogen, iodide, and, thionyl, chloride, on, fire, and, even, oxidises, silver, and, gold, although, it, is, a, weak, ligand, weaker, than, water, a, few, compounds, involving, coordinated, clo, 4, are, known, the, table, below, presents, typical, oxidation, states, for, chlorine, element, as, given, in, the, secondary, schools, or, colleges, anyhow, in, university, chemistry, courses, it, should, be, pointed, out, that, there, are, more, complex, chemical, compounds, the, structure, of, which, can, only, be, explained, using, modern, quantum, chemical, methods, for, example, cluster, technetium, chloride, 3, in, which, 6, of, the, 14, chlorine, atoms, are, formally, divalent, and, oxidation, states, are, fractional, in, addition, all, the, above, chemical, regularities, are, valid, for, normal, or, close, to, normal, conditions, while, at, ultra, high, pressures, for, example, in, the, cores, of, large, planets, chlorine, can, exhibit, an, oxidation, state, of, 3, forming, a, na3cl, compound, with, sodium, which, does, not, fit, into, traditional, concepts, of, chemistry, like, the, other, carbon, halogen, bonds, the, c, cl, bond, is, a, common, functional, group, that, forms, part, of, core, organic, chemistry, formally, compounds, with, this, functional, group, may, be, considered, organic, derivatives, of, the, chloride, anion, due, to, the, difference, of, electronegativity, between, chlorine, 3, 16, and, carbon, 2, 55, the, carbon, in, a, c, cl, bond, is, electron, deficient, and, thus, electrophilic, chlorination, modifies, the, physical, properties, of, hydrocarbons, in, several, ways, chlorocarbons, are, typically, denser, than, water, due, to, the, higher, atomic, weight, of, chlorine, versus, hydrogen, and, aliphatic, organochlorides, are, alkylating, agents, because, chloride, is, a, leaving, group, alkanes, and, aryl, alkanes, may, be, chlorinated, under, free, radical, conditions, with, uv, light, however, the, extent, of, chlorination, is, difficult, to, control, the, reaction, is, not, regioselective, and, often, results, in, a, mixture, of, various, isomers, with, different, degrees, of, chlorination, though, this, may, be, permissible, if, the, products, are, easily, separated, aryl, chlorides, may, be, prepared, by, the, friedel, crafts, halogenation, using, chlorine, and, a, lewis, acid, catalyst, the, haloform, reaction, using, chlorine, and, sodium, hydroxide, is, also, able, to, generate, alkyl, halides, from, methyl, ketones, and, related, compounds, chlorine, adds, to, the, multiple, bonds, on, alkenes, and, alkynes, as, well, giving, di, or, tetrachloro, compounds, however, due, to, the, expense, and, reactivity, of, chlorine, organochlorine, compounds, are, more, commonly, produced, by, using, hydrogen, chloride, or, with, chlorinating, agents, such, as, phosphorus, pentachloride, pcl, 5, or, thionyl, chloride, socl, 2, the, last, is, very, convenient, in, the, laboratory, because, all, side, products, are, gaseous, and, do, not, have, to, be, distilled, out, many, organochlorine, compounds, have, been, isolated, from, natural, sources, ranging, from, bacteria, to, humans, chlorinated, organic, compounds, are, found, in, nearly, every, class, of, biomolecules, including, alkaloids, terpenes, amino, acids, flavonoids, steroids, and, fatty, acids, organochlorides, including, dioxins, are, produced, in, the, high, temperature, environment, of, forest, fires, and, dioxins, have, been, found, in, the, preserved, ashes, of, lightning, ignited, fires, that, predate, synthetic, dioxins, in, addition, a, variety, of, simple, chlorinated, hydrocarbons, including, dichloromethane, chloroform, and, carbon, tetrachloride, have, been, isolated, from, marine, algae, a, majority, of, the, chloromethane, in, the, environment, is, produced, naturally, by, biological, decomposition, forest, fires, and, volcanoes, some, types, of, organochlorides, though, not, all, have, significant, toxicity, to, plants, or, animals, including, humans, dioxins, produced, when, organic, matter, is, burned, in, the, presence, of, chlorine, and, some, insecticides, such, as, ddt, are, persistent, organic, pollutants, which, pose, dangers, when, they, are, released, into, the, environment, for, example, ddt, which, was, widely, used, to, control, insects, in, the, mid, 20th, century, also, accumulates, in, food, chains, and, causes, reproductive, problems, e, g, eggshell, thinning, in, certain, bird, species, due, to, the, ready, homolytic, fission, of, the, c, cl, bond, to, create, chlorine, radicals, in, the, upper, atmosphere, chlorofluorocarbons, have, been, phased, out, due, to, the, harm, they, do, to, the, ozone, layer, chlorine, is, too, reactive, to, occur, as, the, free, element, in, nature, but, is, very, abundant, in, the, form, of, its, chloride, salts, it, is, the, 20th, most, abundant, element, in, earth, s, crust, and, makes, up, 126, parts, per, million, of, it, through, the, large, deposits, of, chloride, minerals, especially, sodium, chloride, that, have, been, evaporated, from, water, bodies, all, of, these, pale, in, comparison, to, the, reserves, of, chloride, ions, in, seawater, smaller, amounts, at, higher, concentrations, occur, in, some, inland, seas, and, underground, brine, wells, such, as, the, great, salt, lake, in, utah, and, the, dead, sea, in, israel, small, batches, of, chlorine, gas, are, prepared, in, the, laboratory, by, combining, hydrochloric, acid, and, manganese, dioxide, but, the, need, rarely, arises, due, to, its, ready, availability, in, industry, elemental, chlorine, is, usually, produced, by, the, electrolysis, of, sodium, chloride, dissolved, in, water, this, method, the, chloralkali, process, industrialized, in, 1892, now, provides, most, industrial, chlorine, gas, along, with, chlorine, the, method, yields, hydrogen, gas, and, sodium, hydroxide, which, is, the, most, valuable, product, the, process, proceeds, according, to, the, following, chemical, equation, chlorine, is, primarily, produced, by, the, chloralkali, process, although, non, chloralkali, processes, exist, global, 2006, production, was, estimated, to, be, 65, million, short, tons, the, most, visible, use, of, chlorine, is, in, water, disinfection, 35, 40, of, chlorine, produced, is, used, to, make, poly, vinyl, chloride, through, ethylene, dichloride, and, vinyl, chloride, the, chlorine, produced, is, available, in, cylinders, from, sizes, ranging, from, 450, g, to, 70, kg, as, well, as, drums, 865, kg, tank, wagons, 15, tonnes, on, roads, 27, 90, tonnes, by, rail, and, barges, 600, 1200, tonnes, due, to, the, difficulty, in, transporting, elemental, chlorine, production, is, typically, located, near, where, it, is, consumed, as, examples, vinyl, chloride, producers, such, as, westlake, chemical, and, formosa, plastics, have, integrated, chloralkali, assets, the, electrolysis, of, chloride, solutions, all, proceed, according, to, the, following, equations, in, the, conventional, case, where, sodium, chloride, is, electrolyzed, sodium, hydroxide, and, chlorine, are, coproducts, industrially, there, are, three, chloralkali, processes, the, castner, kellner, process, was, the, first, method, used, at, the, end, of, the, nineteenth, century, to, produce, chlorine, on, an, industrial, scale, mercury, that, is, toxic, was, used, as, an, electrode, to, amalgamate, the, sodium, product, preventing, undesirable, side, reactions, in, diaphragm, cell, electrolysis, an, asbestos, or, polymer, fiber, diaphragm, separates, a, cathode, and, an, anode, preventing, the, chlorine, forming, at, the, anode, from, re, mixing, with, the, sodium, hydroxide, and, the, hydrogen, formed, at, the, cathode, the, salt, solution, brine, is, continuously, fed, to, the, anode, compartment, and, flows, through, the, diaphragm, to, the, cathode, compartment, where, the, caustic, alkali, is, produced, and, the, brine, is, partially, depleted, diaphragm, methods, produce, dilute, and, slightly, impure, alkali, but, they, are, not, burdened, with, the, problem, of, mercury, disposal, and, they, are, more, energy, efficient, membrane, cell, electrolysis, employs, permeable, membrane, as, an, ion, exchanger, saturated, sodium, or, potassium, chloride, solution, is, passed, through, the, anode, compartment, leaving, at, a, lower, concentration, this, method, also, produces, very, pure, sodium, or, potassium, hydroxide, but, has, the, disadvantage, of, requiring, very, pure, brine, at, high, concentrations, in, the, deacon, process, hydrogen, chloride, recovered, from, the, production, of, organochlorine, compounds, is, recovered, as, chlorine, the, process, relies, on, oxidation, using, oxygen, the, reaction, requires, a, catalyst, as, introduced, by, deacon, early, catalysts, were, based, on, copper, commercial, processes, such, as, the, mitsui, mt, chlorine, process, have, switched, to, chromium, and, ruthenium, based, catalysts, sodium, chloride, is, the, most, common, chlorine, compound, and, is, the, main, source, of, chlorine, for, the, demand, by, the, chemical, industry, about, 15000, chlorine, containing, compounds, are, commercially, traded, including, such, diverse, compounds, as, chlorinated, methane, ethanes, vinyl, chloride, polyvinyl, chloride, pvc, aluminium, trichloride, for, catalysis, the, chlorides, of, magnesium, titanium, zirconium, and, hafnium, which, are, the, precursors, for, producing, the, pure, form, of, those, elements, quantitatively, of, all, elemental, chlorine, produced, about, 63, is, used, in, the, manufacture, of, organic, compounds, and, 18, in, the, manufacture, of, inorganic, chlorine, compounds, about, 15, 000, chlorine, compounds, are, used, commercially, the, remaining, 19, of, chlorine, produced, is, used, for, bleaches, and, disinfection, products, the, most, significant, of, organic, compounds, in, terms, of, production, volume, are, 1, 2, dichloroethane, and, vinyl, chloride, intermediates, in, the, production, of, pvc, other, particularly, important, organochlorines, are, methyl, chloride, methylene, chloride, chloroform, vinylidene, chloride, trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, allyl, chloride, epichlorohydrin, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzenes, and, trichlorobenzenes, the, major, inorganic, compounds, include, hcl, cl, 2, o, hocl, naclo, 3, alcl, 3, sicl, 4, sncl, 4, pcl, 3, pcl, 5, pocl, 3, ascl, 3, sbcl, 3, sbcl, 5, bicl, 3, and, zncl, 2, in, france, as, elsewhere, animal, intestines, were, processed, to, make, musical, instrument, strings, goldbeater, s, skin, and, other, products, this, was, done, in, gut, factories, boyauderies, and, it, was, an, odiferous, and, unhealthy, process, in, or, about, 1820, the, soci, t, d, encouragement, pour, l, industrie, nationale, offered, a, prize, for, the, discovery, of, a, method, chemical, or, mechanical, for, separating, the, peritoneal, membrane, of, animal, intestines, without, putrefaction, the, prize, was, won, by, antoine, germain, labarraque, a, 44, year, old, french, chemist, and, pharmacist, who, had, discovered, that, berthollet, s, chlorinated, bleaching, solutions, eau, de, javel, not, only, destroyed, the, smell, of, putrefaction, of, animal, tissue, decomposition, but, also, actually, retarded, the, decomposition, labarraque, s, research, resulted, in, the, use, of, chlorides, and, hypochlorites, of, lime, calcium, hypochlorite, and, of, sodium, sodium, hypochlorite, in, the, boyauderies, the, same, chemicals, were, found, to, be, useful, in, the, routine, disinfection, and, deodorization, of, latrines, sewers, markets, abattoirs, anatomical, theatres, and, morgues, they, were, successful, in, hospitals, lazarets, prisons, infirmaries, both, on, land, and, at, sea, magnaneries, stables, cattle, sheds, etc, and, they, were, beneficial, during, exhumations, embalming, outbreaks, of, epidemic, disease, fever, and, blackleg, in, cattle, labarraque, s, chlorinated, lime, and, soda, solutions, have, been, advocated, since, 1828, to, prevent, infection, called, contagious, infection, presumed, to, be, transmitted, by, miasmas, and, to, treat, putrefaction, of, existing, wounds, including, septic, wounds, in, his, 1828, work, labarraque, recommended, that, doctors, breathe, chlorine, wash, their, hands, in, chlorinated, lime, and, even, sprinkle, chlorinated, lime, about, the, patients, beds, in, cases, of, contagious, infection, in, 1828, the, contagion, of, infections, was, well, known, even, though, the, agency, of, the, microbe, was, not, discovered, until, more, than, half, a, century, later, during, the, paris, cholera, outbreak, of, 1832, large, quantities, of, so, called, chloride, of, lime, were, used, to, disinfect, the, capital, this, was, not, simply, modern, calcium, chloride, but, chlorine, gas, dissolved, in, lime, water, dilute, calcium, hydroxide, to, form, calcium, hypochlorite, chlorinated, lime, labarraque, s, discovery, helped, to, remove, the, terrible, stench, of, decay, from, hospitals, and, dissecting, rooms, and, by, doing, so, effectively, deodorised, the, latin, quarter, of, paris, these, putrid, miasmas, were, thought, by, many, to, cause, the, spread, of, contagion, and, infection, both, words, used, before, the, germ, theory, of, infection, chloride, of, lime, was, used, for, destroying, odors, and, putrid, matter, one, source, claims, chloride, of, lime, was, used, by, dr, john, snow, to, disinfect, water, from, the, cholera, contaminated, well, that, was, feeding, the, broad, street, pump, in, 1854, london, though, three, other, reputable, sources, that, describe, that, famous, cholera, epidemic, do, not, mention, the, incident, one, reference, makes, it, clear, that, chloride, of, lime, was, used, to, disinfect, the, offal, and, filth, in, the, streets, surrounding, the, broad, street, pump, a, common, practice, in, mid, nineteenth, century, england, 296, perhaps, the, most, famous, application, of, labarraque, s, chlorine, and, chemical, base, solutions, was, in, 1847, when, ignaz, semmelweis, used, chlorine, water, chlorine, dissolved, in, pure, water, which, was, cheaper, than, chlorinated, lime, solutions, to, disinfect, the, hands, of, austrian, doctors, which, semmelweis, noticed, still, carried, the, stench, of, decomposition, from, the, dissection, rooms, to, the, patient, examination, rooms, long, before, the, germ, theory, of, disease, semmelweis, theorized, that, cadaveric, particles, were, transmitting, decay, from, fresh, medical, cadavers, to, living, patients, and, he, used, the, well, known, labarraque, s, solutions, as, the, only, known, method, to, remove, the, smell, of, decay, and, tissue, decomposition, which, he, found, that, soap, did, not, the, solutions, proved, to, be, far, more, effective, antiseptics, than, soap, semmelweis, was, also, aware, of, their, greater, efficacy, but, not, the, reason, and, this, resulted, in, semmelweis, s, celebrated, success, in, stopping, the, transmission, of, childbed, fever, puerperal, fever, in, the, maternity, wards, of, vienna, general, hospital, in, austria, in, 1847, much, later, during, world, war, i, in, 1916, a, standardized, and, diluted, modification, of, labarraque, s, solution, containing, hypochlorite, 0, 5, and, boric, acid, as, an, acidic, stabilizer, was, developed, by, henry, drysdale, dakin, who, gave, full, credit, to, labarraque, s, prior, work, in, this, area, called, dakin, s, solution, the, method, of, wound, irrigation, with, chlorinated, solutions, allowed, antiseptic, treatment, of, a, wide, variety, of, open, wounds, long, before, the, modern, antibiotic, era, a, modified, version, of, this, solution, continues, to, be, employed, in, wound, irrigation, in, modern, times, where, it, remains, effective, against, bacteria, that, are, resistant, to, multiple, antibiotics, see, century, pharmaceuticals, the, first, continuous, application, of, chlorination, to, drinking, u, s, water, was, installed, in, jersey, city, new, jersey, in, 1908, by, 1918, the, us, department, of, treasury, called, for, all, drinking, water, to, be, disinfected, with, chlorine, chlorine, is, presently, an, important, chemical, for, water, purification, such, as, in, water, treatment, plants, in, disinfectants, and, in, bleach, even, small, water, supplies, are, now, routinely, chlorinated, chlorine, is, usually, used, in, the, form, of, hypochlorous, acid, to, kill, bacteria, and, other, microbes, in, drinking, water, supplies, and, public, swimming, pools, in, most, private, swimming, pools, chlorine, itself, is, not, used, but, rather, sodium, hypochlorite, formed, from, chlorine, and, sodium, hydroxide, or, solid, tablets, of, chlorinated, isocyanurates, the, drawback, of, using, chlorine, in, swimming, pools, is, that, the, chlorine, reacts, with, the, amino, acids, in, proteins, in, human, hair, and, skin, contrary, to, popular, belief, the, distinctive, chlorine, aroma, associated, with, swimming, pools, is, not, the, result, of, elemental, chlorine, itself, but, of, chloramine, a, chemical, compound, produced, by, the, reaction, of, free, dissolved, chlorine, with, amines, in, organic, substances, including, those, in, urine, and, sweat, as, a, disinfectant, in, water, chlorine, is, more, than, three, times, as, effective, against, escherichia, coli, as, bromine, and, more, than, six, times, as, effective, as, iodine, increasingly, monochloramine, itself, is, being, directly, added, to, drinking, water, for, purposes, of, disinfection, a, process, known, as, chloramination, it, is, often, impractical, to, store, and, use, poisonous, chlorine, gas, for, water, treatment, so, alternative, methods, of, adding, chlorine, are, used, these, include, hypochlorite, solutions, which, gradually, release, chlorine, into, the, water, and, compounds, like, sodium, dichloro, s, triazinetrione, dihydrate, or, anhydrous, sometimes, referred, to, as, dichlor, and, trichloro, s, triazinetrione, sometimes, referred, to, as, trichlor, these, compounds, are, stable, while, solid, and, may, be, used, in, powdered, granular, or, tablet, form, when, added, in, small, amounts, to, pool, water, or, industrial, water, systems, the, chlorine, atoms, hydrolyze, from, the, rest, of, the, molecule, forming, hypochlorous, acid, hocl, which, acts, as, a, general, biocide, killing, germs, microorganisms, algae, and, so, on, chlorine, gas, also, known, as, bertholite, was, first, used, as, a, weapon, in, world, war, i, by, germany, on, april, 22, 1915, in, the, second, battle, of, ypres, as, described, by, the, soldiers, it, had, the, distinctive, smell, of, a, mixture, of, pepper, and, pineapple, it, also, tasted, metallic, and, stung, the, back, of, the, throat, and, chest, chlorine, reacts, with, water, in, the, mucosa, of, the, lungs, to, form, hydrochloric, acid, destructive, to, living, tissue, and, potentially, lethal, human, respiratory, systems, can, be, protected, from, chlorine, gas, by, gas, masks, with, activated, charcoal, or, other, filters, which, makes, chlorine, gas, much, less, lethal, than, other, chemical, weapons, it, was, pioneered, by, a, german, scientist, later, to, be, a, nobel, laureate, fritz, haber, of, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, in, berlin, in, collaboration, with, the, german, chemical, conglomerate, ig, farben, which, developed, methods, for, discharging, chlorine, gas, against, an, entrenched, enemy, after, its, first, use, both, sides, in, the, conflict, used, chlorine, as, a, chemical, weapon, but, it, was, soon, replaced, by, the, more, deadly, phosgene, and, mustard, gas, chlorine, gas, was, also, used, during, the, iraq, war, in, anbar, province, in, 2007, with, insurgents, packing, truck, bombs, with, mortar, shells, and, chlorine, tanks, the, attacks, killed, two, people, from, the, explosives, and, sickened, more, than, 350, most, of, the, deaths, were, caused, by, the, force, of, the, explosions, rather, than, the, effects, of, chlorine, since, the, toxic, gas, is, readily, dispersed, and, diluted, in, the, atmosphere, by, the, blast, in, some, bombings, over, a, hundred, civilians, were, hospitalized, due, to, breathing, difficulties, the, iraqi, authorities, tightened, security, for, elemental, chlorine, which, is, essential, for, providing, safe, drinking, water, to, the, population, on, 23, october, 2014, it, was, reported, that, the, islamic, state, of, iraq, and, the, levant, had, used, chlorine, gas, in, the, town, of, duluiyah, iraq, laboratory, analysis, of, clothing, and, soil, samples, confirmed, the, use, of, chlorine, gas, against, kurdish, peshmerga, forces, in, a, vehicle, borne, improvised, explosive, device, attack, on, 23, january, 2015, at, the, highway, 47, kiske, junction, near, mosul, another, country, in, the, middle, east, syria, has, used, chlorine, as, a, chemical, weapon, delivered, from, barrel, bombs, and, rockets, in, 2016, the, opcw, un, joint, investigative, mechanism, concluded, that, the, syrian, government, used, chlorine, as, a, chemical, weapon, in, three, separate, attacks, later, investigations, from, the, opcw, s, investigation, and, identification, team, concluded, that, the, syrian, air, force, was, responsible, for, chlorine, attacks, in, 2017, and, 2018, the, chloride, anion, is, an, essential, nutrient, for, metabolism, chlorine, is, needed, for, the, production, of, hydrochloric, acid, in, the, stomach, and, in, cellular, pump, functions, the, main, dietary, source, is, table, salt, or, sodium, chloride, overly, low, or, high, concentrations, of, chloride, in, the, blood, are, examples, of, electrolyte, disturbances, hypochloremia, having, too, little, chloride, rarely, occurs, in, the, absence, of, other, abnormalities, it, is, sometimes, associated, with, hypoventilation, it, can, be, associated, with, chronic, respiratory, acidosis, hyperchloremia, having, too, much, chloride, usually, does, not, produce, symptoms, when, symptoms, do, occur, they, tend, to, resemble, those, of, hypernatremia, having, too, much, sodium, reduction, in, blood, chloride, leads, to, cerebral, dehydration, symptoms, are, most, often, caused, by, rapid, rehydration, which, results, in, cerebral, edema, hyperchloremia, can, affect, oxygen, transport, chlorine, is, a, toxic, gas, that, attacks, the, respiratory, system, eyes, and, skin, because, it, is, denser, than, air, it, tends, to, accumulate, at, the, bottom, of, poorly, ventilated, spaces, chlorine, gas, is, a, strong, oxidizer, which, may, react, with, flammable, materials, chlorine, is, detectable, with, measuring, devices, in, concentrations, as, low, as, 0, 2, parts, per, million, ppm, and, by, smell, at, 3, ppm, coughing, and, vomiting, may, occur, at, 30, ppm, and, lung, damage, at, 60, ppm, about, 1000, ppm, can, be, fatal, after, a, few, deep, breaths, of, the, gas, the, idlh, immediately, dangerous, to, life, and, health, concentration, is, 10, ppm, breathing, lower, concentrations, can, aggravate, the, respiratory, system, and, exposure, to, the, gas, can, irritate, the, eyes, when, chlorine, is, inhaled, at, concentrations, greater, than, 30, ppm, it, reacts, with, water, within, the, lungs, producing, hydrochloric, acid, hcl, and, hypochlorous, acid, hocl, when, used, at, specified, levels, for, water, disinfection, the, reaction, of, chlorine, with, water, is, not, a, major, concern, for, human, health, other, materials, present, in, the, water, may, generate, disinfection, by, products, that, are, associated, with, negative, effects, on, human, health, in, the, united, states, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, has, set, the, permissible, exposure, limit, for, elemental, chlorine, at, 1, ppm, or, 3, mg, m, 3, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, has, designated, a, recommended, exposure, limit, of, 0, 5, ppm, over, 15, minutes, in, the, home, accidents, occur, when, hypochlorite, bleach, solutions, come, into, contact, with, certain, acidic, drain, cleaners, to, produce, chlorine, gas, hypochlorite, bleach, a, popular, laundry, additive, combined, with, ammonia, another, popular, laundry, additive, produces, chloramines, another, toxic, group, of, chemicals, chlorine, is, widely, used, for, purifying, water, especially, potable, water, supplies, and, water, used, in, swimming, pools, several, catastrophic, collapses, of, swimming, pool, ceilings, have, occurred, from, chlorine, induced, stress, corrosion, cracking, of, stainless, steel, suspension, rods, some, polymers, are, also, sensitive, to, attack, including, acetal, resin, and, polybutene, both, materials, were, used, in, hot, and, cold, water, domestic, plumbing, and, stress, corrosion, cracking, caused, widespread, failures, in, the, us, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, the, element, iron, can,
