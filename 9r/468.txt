sodium, hydroxide, also, known, as, lye, and, caustic, soda, is, an, inorganic, compound, with, the, formula, naoh, it, is, a, white, solid, ionic, compound, consisting, of, sodium, cations, na, and, hydroxide, anions, oh, sodium, hydroxide, is, a, highly, corrosive, base, and, alkali, that, decomposes, lipids, and, proteins, at, ambient, temperatures, and, may, cause, severe, chemical, burns, it, is, highly, soluble, in, water, and, readily, absorbs, moisture, and, carbon, dioxide, from, the, air, it, forms, a, series, of, hydrates, naoh, n, h, 2, o, the, monohydrate, naoh, h, 2, o, crystallizes, from, water, solutions, between, 12, 3, and, 61, 8, c, the, commercially, available, sodium, hydroxide, is, often, this, monohydrate, and, published, data, may, refer, to, it, instead, of, the, anhydrous, compound, as, one, of, the, simplest, hydroxides, sodium, hydroxide, is, frequently, used, alongside, neutral, water, and, acidic, hydrochloric, acid, to, demonstrate, the, ph, scale, to, chemistry, students, sodium, hydroxide, is, used, in, many, industries, in, the, making, of, wood, pulp, and, paper, textiles, drinking, water, soaps, and, detergents, and, as, a, drain, cleaner, worldwide, production, in, 2004, was, approximately, 60, million, tons, while, demand, was, 51, million, tons, pure, sodium, hydroxide, is, a, colorless, crystalline, solid, that, melts, at, 318, c, 604, f, without, decomposition, and, boils, at, 1, 388, c, 2, 530, f, it, is, highly, soluble, in, water, with, a, lower, solubility, in, polar, solvents, such, as, ethanol, and, methanol, sodium, hydroxide, is, insoluble, in, ether, and, other, non, polar, solvents, similar, to, the, hydration, of, sulfuric, acid, dissolution, of, solid, sodium, hydroxide, in, water, is, a, highly, exothermic, reaction, where, a, large, amount, of, heat, is, liberated, posing, a, threat, to, safety, through, the, possibility, of, splashing, the, resulting, solution, is, usually, colorless, and, odorless, as, with, other, alkaline, solutions, it, feels, slippery, with, skin, contact, due, to, the, process, of, saponification, that, occurs, between, naoh, and, natural, skin, oils, concentrated, 50, aqueous, solutions, of, sodium, hydroxide, have, a, characteristic, viscosity, 78, m, pa, s, that, is, much, greater, than, that, of, water, 1, 0, mpa, s, and, near, that, of, olive, oil, 85, mpa, s, at, room, temperature, the, viscosity, of, aqueous, naoh, as, with, any, liquid, chemical, is, inversely, related, to, its, temperature, i, e, its, viscosity, decreases, as, temperature, increases, and, vice, versa, the, viscosity, of, sodium, hydroxide, solutions, plays, a, direct, role, in, its, application, as, well, as, its, storage, sodium, hydroxide, can, form, several, hydrates, naoh, n, h, 2, o, which, result, in, a, complex, solubility, diagram, that, was, described, in, detail, by, spencer, umfreville, pickering, in, 1893, the, known, hydrates, and, the, approximate, ranges, of, temperature, and, concentration, mass, percent, of, naoh, of, their, saturated, water, solutions, are, early, reports, refer, to, hydrates, with, n, 0, 5, or, n, 2, 3, but, later, careful, investigations, failed, to, confirm, their, existence, the, only, hydrates, with, stable, melting, points, are, naoh, h, 2, o, 65, 10, c, and, naoh, 3, 5h, 2, o, 15, 38, c, the, other, hydrates, except, the, metastable, ones, naoh, 3h, 2, o, and, naoh, 4h, 2, o, can, be, crystallized, from, solutions, of, the, proper, composition, as, listed, above, however, solutions, of, naoh, can, be, easily, supercooled, by, many, degrees, which, allows, the, formation, of, hydrates, including, the, metastable, ones, from, solutions, with, different, concentrations, for, example, when, a, solution, of, naoh, and, water, with, 1, 2, mole, ratio, 52, 6, naoh, by, mass, is, cooled, the, monohydrate, normally, starts, to, crystallize, at, about, 22, c, before, the, dihydrate, however, the, solution, can, easily, be, supercooled, down, to, 15, c, at, which, point, it, may, quickly, crystallize, as, the, dihydrate, when, heated, the, solid, dihydrate, might, melt, directly, into, a, solution, at, 13, 35, c, however, once, the, temperature, exceeds, 12, 58, c, it, often, decomposes, into, solid, monohydrate, and, a, liquid, solution, even, the, n, 3, 5, hydrate, is, difficult, to, crystallize, because, the, solution, supercools, so, much, that, other, hydrates, become, more, stable, a, hot, water, solution, containing, 73, 1, mass, of, naoh, is, a, eutectic, that, solidifies, at, about, 62, 63, c, as, an, intimate, mix, of, anhydrous, and, monohydrate, crystals, a, second, stable, eutectic, composition, is, 45, 4, mass, of, naoh, that, solidifies, at, about, 4, 9, c, into, a, mixture, of, crystals, of, the, dihydrate, and, of, the, 3, 5, hydrate, the, third, stable, eutectic, has, 18, 4, mass, of, naoh, it, solidifies, at, about, 28, 7, c, as, a, mixture, of, water, ice, and, the, heptahydrate, naoh, 7h, 2, o, when, solutions, with, less, than, 18, 4, naoh, are, cooled, water, ice, crystallizes, first, leaving, the, naoh, in, solution, the, form, of, the, tetrahydrate, has, density, 1, 33, g, cm, 3, it, melts, congruously, at, 7, 55, c, into, a, liquid, with, 35, 7, naoh, and, density, 1, 392, g, cm, 3, and, therefore, floats, on, it, like, ice, on, water, however, at, about, 4, 9, c, it, may, instead, melt, incongruously, into, a, mixture, of, solid, naoh, 3, 5h, 2, o, and, a, liquid, solution, the, form, of, the, tetrahydrate, is, metastable, and, often, transforms, spontaneously, to, the, form, when, cooled, below, 20, c, once, initiated, the, exothermic, transformation, is, complete, in, a, few, minutes, with, a, 6, 5, increase, in, volume, of, the, solid, the, form, can, be, crystallized, from, supercooled, solutions, at, 26, c, and, melts, partially, at, 1, 83, c, the, sodium, hydroxide, of, commerce, is, often, the, monohydrate, density, 1, 829, g, cm, 3, physical, data, in, technical, literature, may, refer, to, this, form, rather, than, the, anhydrous, compound, naoh, and, its, monohydrate, form, orthorhombic, crystals, with, the, space, groups, cmcm, os8, and, pbca, op24, respectively, the, monohydrate, cell, dimensions, are, a, 1, 1825, b, 0, 6213, c, 0, 6069, nm, the, atoms, are, arranged, in, a, hydrargillite, like, layer, structure, with, each, sodium, atom, surrounded, by, six, oxygen, atoms, three, each, from, hydroxide, ions, and, three, from, water, molecules, the, hydrogen, atoms, of, the, hydroxyls, form, strong, bonds, with, oxygen, atoms, within, each, o, layer, adjacent, o, layers, are, held, together, by, hydrogen, bonds, between, water, molecules, sodium, hydroxide, reacts, with, protic, acids, to, produce, water, and, the, corresponding, salts, for, example, when, sodium, hydroxide, reacts, with, hydrochloric, acid, sodium, chloride, is, formed, in, general, such, neutralization, reactions, are, represented, by, one, simple, net, ionic, equation, this, type, of, reaction, with, a, strong, acid, releases, heat, and, hence, is, exothermic, such, acid, base, reactions, can, also, be, used, for, titrations, however, sodium, hydroxide, is, not, used, as, a, primary, standard, because, it, is, hygroscopic, and, absorbs, carbon, dioxide, from, air, sodium, hydroxide, also, reacts, with, acidic, oxides, such, as, sulfur, dioxide, such, reactions, are, often, used, to, scrub, harmful, acidic, gases, like, so, 2, and, h, 2, s, produced, in, the, burning, of, coal, and, thus, prevent, their, release, into, the, atmosphere, for, example, glass, reacts, slowly, with, aqueous, sodium, hydroxide, solutions, at, ambient, temperatures, to, form, soluble, silicates, because, of, this, glass, joints, and, stopcocks, exposed, to, sodium, hydroxide, have, a, tendency, to, freeze, flasks, and, glass, lined, chemical, reactors, are, damaged, by, long, exposure, to, hot, sodium, hydroxide, which, also, frosts, the, glass, sodium, hydroxide, does, not, attack, iron, at, room, temperature, since, iron, does, not, have, amphoteric, properties, i, e, it, only, dissolves, in, acid, not, base, nevertheless, at, high, temperatures, e, g, above, 500, c, iron, can, react, endothermically, with, sodium, hydroxide, to, form, iron, iii, oxide, sodium, metal, and, hydrogen, gas, this, is, due, to, the, lower, enthalpy, of, formation, of, iron, iii, oxide, 824, 2, kj, mol, compared, to, sodium, hydroxide, 500, kj, mol, and, positive, entropy, change, of, the, reaction, which, implies, spontaneity, at, high, temperatures, st, h, g, 0, and, non, spontaneity, at, low, temperatures, st, h, g, 0, consider, the, following, reaction, between, molten, sodium, hydroxide, and, finely, divided, iron, filings, a, few, transition, metals, however, may, react, quite, vigorously, with, sodium, hydroxide, under, milder, conditions, in, 1986, an, aluminium, road, tanker, in, the, uk, was, mistakenly, used, to, transport, 25, sodium, hydroxide, solution, causing, pressurization, of, the, contents, and, damage, to, tankers, the, pressurization, is, due, to, the, hydrogen, gas, which, is, produced, in, the, reaction, between, sodium, hydroxide, and, aluminium, unlike, sodium, hydroxide, which, is, soluble, the, hydroxides, of, most, transition, metals, are, insoluble, and, therefore, sodium, hydroxide, can, be, used, to, precipitate, transition, metal, hydroxides, the, following, colours, are, observed, zinc, and, lead, salts, dissolve, in, excess, sodium, hydroxide, to, give, a, clear, solution, of, na, 2, zno, 2, or, na, 2, pbo, 2, aluminium, hydroxide, is, used, as, a, gelatinous, flocculant, to, filter, out, particulate, matter, in, water, treatment, aluminium, hydroxide, is, prepared, at, the, treatment, plant, from, aluminium, sulfate, by, reacting, it, with, sodium, hydroxide, or, bicarbonate, sodium, hydroxide, can, be, used, for, the, base, driven, hydrolysis, of, esters, also, called, saponification, amides, and, alkyl, halides, however, the, limited, solubility, of, sodium, hydroxide, in, organic, solvents, means, that, the, more, soluble, potassium, hydroxide, koh, is, often, preferred, touching, a, sodium, hydroxide, solution, with, bare, hands, while, not, recommended, produces, a, slippery, feeling, this, happens, because, oils, on, the, skin, such, as, sebum, are, converted, to, soap, despite, solubility, in, propylene, glycol, it, is, unlikely, to, replace, water, in, saponification, due, to, propylene, glycol, s, primary, reaction, with, fat, before, reaction, between, sodium, hydroxide, and, fat, sodium, hydroxide, is, industrially, produced, as, a, 50, solution, by, variations, of, the, electrolytic, chloralkali, process, chlorine, gas, is, also, produced, in, this, process, solid, sodium, hydroxide, is, obtained, from, this, solution, by, the, evaporation, of, water, solid, sodium, hydroxide, is, most, commonly, sold, as, flakes, prills, and, cast, blocks, in, 2004, world, production, was, estimated, at, 60, million, dry, tonnes, of, sodium, hydroxide, and, demand, was, estimated, at, 51, million, tonnes, in, 1998, total, world, production, was, around, 45, million, tonnes, north, america, and, asia, each, contributed, around, 14, million, tonnes, while, europe, produced, around, 10, million, tonnes, in, the, united, states, the, major, producer, of, sodium, hydroxide, is, olin, which, has, annual, production, around, 5, 7, million, tonnes, from, sites, at, freeport, texas, plaquemine, louisiana, st, gabriel, louisiana, mcintosh, alabama, charleston, tennessee, niagara, falls, new, york, and, b, cancour, canada, other, major, us, producers, include, oxychem, westlake, shintek, and, formosa, all, of, these, companies, use, the, chloralkali, process, historically, sodium, hydroxide, was, produced, by, treating, sodium, carbonate, with, calcium, hydroxide, slaked, lime, in, a, metathesis, reaction, which, takes, advantage, of, the, fact, that, sodium, hydroxide, is, soluble, while, calcium, carbonate, is, not, this, process, was, called, causticizing, the, sodium, carbonate, for, this, reaction, was, produced, by, the, leblanc, process, in, the, early, 19th, century, or, the, solvay, process, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, conversion, of, sodium, carbonate, to, sodium, hydroxide, was, superseded, entirely, by, the, chloralkali, process, which, produces, sodium, hydroxide, in, a, single, process, sodium, hydroxide, is, also, produced, by, combining, pure, sodium, metal, with, water, the, byproducts, are, hydrogen, gas, and, heat, often, resulting, in, a, flame, this, reaction, is, commonly, used, for, demonstrating, the, reactivity, of, alkali, metals, in, academic, environments, however, it, is, not, used, commercially, aside, from, a, reaction, within, the, mercury, cell, chloralkali, process, where, sodium, amalgam, is, reacted, with, water, sodium, hydroxide, is, a, popular, strong, base, used, in, industry, sodium, hydroxide, is, used, in, the, manufacture, of, sodium, salts, and, detergents, ph, regulation, and, organic, synthesis, in, bulk, it, is, most, often, handled, as, an, aqueous, solution, since, solutions, are, cheaper, and, easier, to, handle, sodium, hydroxide, is, used, in, many, scenarios, where, it, is, desirable, to, increase, the, alkalinity, of, a, mixture, or, to, neutralize, acids, for, example, in, the, petroleum, industry, sodium, hydroxide, is, used, as, an, additive, in, drilling, mud, to, increase, alkalinity, in, bentonite, mud, systems, to, increase, the, mud, viscosity, and, to, neutralize, any, acid, gas, such, as, hydrogen, sulfide, and, carbon, dioxide, which, may, be, encountered, in, the, geological, formation, as, drilling, progresses, another, use, is, in, salt, spray, testing, where, ph, needs, to, be, regulated, sodium, hydroxide, is, used, with, hydrochloric, acid, to, balance, ph, the, resultant, salt, nacl, is, the, corrosive, agent, used, in, the, standard, neutral, ph, salt, spray, test, poor, quality, crude, oil, can, be, treated, with, sodium, hydroxide, to, remove, sulfurous, impurities, in, a, process, known, as, caustic, washing, sodium, hydroxide, reacts, with, weak, acids, such, as, hydrogen, sulfide, and, mercaptans, to, yield, non, volatile, sodium, salts, which, can, be, removed, the, waste, which, is, formed, is, toxic, and, difficult, to, deal, with, and, the, process, is, banned, in, many, countries, because, of, this, in, 2006, trafigura, used, the, process, and, then, dumped, the, waste, in, ivory, coast, other, common, uses, of, sodium, hydroxide, include, sodium, hydroxide, is, also, widely, used, in, pulping, of, wood, for, making, paper, or, regenerated, fibers, along, with, sodium, sulfide, sodium, hydroxide, is, a, key, component, of, the, white, liquor, solution, used, to, separate, lignin, from, cellulose, fibers, in, the, kraft, process, it, also, plays, a, key, role, in, several, later, stages, of, the, process, of, bleaching, the, brown, pulp, resulting, from, the, pulping, process, these, stages, include, oxygen, delignification, oxidative, extraction, and, simple, extraction, all, of, which, require, a, strong, alkaline, environment, with, a, ph, 10, 5, at, the, end, of, the, stages, in, a, similar, fashion, sodium, hydroxide, is, used, to, digest, tissues, as, in, a, process, that, was, used, with, farm, animals, at, one, time, this, process, involved, placing, a, carcass, into, a, sealed, chamber, then, adding, a, mixture, of, sodium, hydroxide, and, water, which, breaks, the, chemical, bonds, that, keep, the, flesh, intact, this, eventually, turns, the, body, into, a, liquid, with, a, dark, brown, color, and, the, only, solids, that, remain, are, bone, hulls, which, can, be, crushed, between, one, s, fingertips, sodium, hydroxide, is, frequently, used, in, the, process, of, decomposing, roadkill, dumped, in, landfills, by, animal, disposal, contractors, due, to, its, availability, and, low, cost, it, has, been, used, by, criminals, to, dispose, of, corpses, italian, serial, killer, leonarda, cianciulli, used, this, chemical, to, turn, dead, bodies, into, soap, in, mexico, a, man, who, worked, for, drug, cartels, admitted, disposing, of, over, 300, bodies, with, it, sodium, hydroxide, is, a, dangerous, chemical, due, to, its, ability, to, hydrolyze, protein, if, a, dilute, solution, is, spilled, on, the, skin, burns, may, result, if, the, area, is, not, washed, thoroughly, and, for, several, minutes, with, running, water, splashes, in, the, eye, can, be, more, serious, and, can, lead, to, blindness, strong, bases, attack, aluminium, sodium, hydroxide, reacts, with, aluminium, and, water, to, release, hydrogen, gas, the, aluminium, takes, an, oxygen, atom, from, sodium, hydroxide, which, in, turn, takes, an, oxygen, atom, from, water, and, releases, two, hydrogen, atoms, the, reaction, thus, produces, hydrogen, gas, and, sodium, aluminate, in, this, reaction, sodium, hydroxide, acts, as, an, agent, to, make, the, solution, alkaline, which, aluminium, can, dissolve, in, sodium, aluminate, is, an, inorganic, chemical, that, is, used, as, an, effective, source, of, aluminium, hydroxide, for, many, industrial, and, technical, applications, pure, sodium, aluminate, anhydrous, is, a, white, crystalline, solid, having, a, formula, variously, given, as, naalo, 2, na, 3, alo, 3, na, na, 2, o, al, 2, o, 3, or, na, 2, al, 2, o, 4, formation, of, sodium, tetrahydroxoaluminate, iii, or, hydrated, sodium, aluminate, is, given, by, this, reaction, can, be, useful, in, etching, removing, anodizing, or, converting, a, polished, surface, to, a, satin, like, finish, but, without, further, passivation, such, as, anodizing, or, alodining, the, surface, may, become, degraded, either, under, normal, use, or, in, severe, atmospheric, conditions, in, the, bayer, process, sodium, hydroxide, is, used, in, the, refining, of, alumina, containing, ores, bauxite, to, produce, alumina, aluminium, oxide, which, is, the, raw, material, used, to, produce, aluminium, via, the, electrolytic, hall, h, roult, process, since, the, alumina, is, amphoteric, it, dissolves, in, the, sodium, hydroxide, leaving, impurities, less, soluble, at, high, ph, such, as, iron, oxides, behind, in, the, form, of, a, highly, alkaline, red, mud, other, amphoteric, metals, are, zinc, and, lead, which, dissolve, in, concentrated, sodium, hydroxide, solutions, to, give, sodium, zincate, and, sodium, plumbate, respectively, sodium, hydroxide, is, traditionally, used, in, soap, making, cold, process, soap, saponification, it, was, made, in, the, nineteenth, century, for, a, hard, surface, rather, than, liquid, product, because, it, was, easier, to, store, and, transport, for, the, manufacture, of, biodiesel, sodium, hydroxide, is, used, as, a, catalyst, for, the, transesterification, of, methanol, and, triglycerides, this, only, works, with, anhydrous, sodium, hydroxide, because, combined, with, water, the, fat, would, turn, into, soap, which, would, be, tainted, with, methanol, naoh, is, used, more, often, than, potassium, hydroxide, because, it, is, cheaper, and, a, smaller, quantity, is, needed, due, to, production, costs, naoh, which, is, produced, using, common, salt, is, cheaper, than, potassium, hydroxide, sodium, hydroxide, is, an, ingredient, used, in, some, skincare, and, cosmetic, products, such, as, facial, cleansers, creams, lotions, and, makeup, it, is, typically, used, in, low, concentration, as, a, ph, balancer, due, its, highly, alkaline, nature, food, uses, of, sodium, hydroxide, include, washing, or, chemical, peeling, of, fruits, and, vegetables, chocolate, and, cocoa, processing, caramel, coloring, production, poultry, scalding, soft, drink, processing, and, thickening, ice, cream, olives, are, often, soaked, in, sodium, hydroxide, for, softening, pretzels, and, german, lye, rolls, are, glazed, with, a, sodium, hydroxide, solution, before, baking, to, make, them, crisp, owing, to, the, difficulty, in, obtaining, food, grade, sodium, hydroxide, in, small, quantities, for, home, use, sodium, carbonate, is, often, used, in, place, of, sodium, hydroxide, it, is, known, as, e, number, e524, specific, foods, processed, with, sodium, hydroxide, include, sodium, hydroxide, is, frequently, used, as, an, industrial, cleaning, agent, where, it, is, often, called, caustic, it, is, added, to, water, heated, and, then, used, to, clean, process, equipment, storage, tanks, etc, it, can, dissolve, grease, oils, fats, and, protein, based, deposits, it, is, also, used, for, cleaning, waste, discharge, pipes, under, sinks, and, drains, in, domestic, properties, surfactants, can, be, added, to, the, sodium, hydroxide, solution, in, order, to, stabilize, dissolved, substances, and, thus, prevent, redeposition, a, sodium, hydroxide, soak, solution, is, used, as, a, powerful, degreaser, on, stainless, steel, and, glass, bakeware, it, is, also, a, common, ingredient, in, oven, cleaners, a, common, use, of, sodium, hydroxide, is, in, the, production, of, parts, washer, detergents, parts, washer, detergents, based, on, sodium, hydroxide, are, some, of, the, most, aggressive, parts, washer, cleaning, chemicals, the, sodium, hydroxide, based, detergents, include, surfactants, rust, inhibitors, and, defoamers, a, parts, washer, heats, water, and, the, detergent, in, a, closed, cabinet, and, then, sprays, the, heated, sodium, hydroxide, and, hot, water, at, pressure, against, dirty, parts, for, degreasing, applications, sodium, hydroxide, used, in, this, manner, replaced, many, solvent, based, systems, in, the, early, 1990s, when, trichloroethane, was, outlawed, by, the, montreal, protocol, water, and, sodium, hydroxide, detergent, based, parts, washers, are, considered, to, be, an, environmental, improvement, over, the, solvent, based, cleaning, methods, sodium, hydroxide, is, used, in, the, home, as, a, type, of, drain, openers, to, unblock, clogged, drains, usually, in, the, form, of, a, dry, crystal, or, as, a, thick, liquid, gel, the, alkali, dissolves, greases, to, produce, water, soluble, products, it, also, hydrolyzes, proteins, such, as, those, found, in, hair, which, may, block, water, pipes, these, reactions, are, sped, by, the, heat, generated, when, sodium, hydroxide, and, the, other, chemical, components, of, the, cleaner, dissolve, in, water, such, alkaline, drain, cleaners, and, their, acidic, versions, are, highly, corrosive, and, should, be, handled, with, great, caution, sodium, hydroxide, is, used, in, some, relaxers, to, straighten, hair, however, because, of, the, high, incidence, and, intensity, of, chemical, burns, manufacturers, of, chemical, relaxers, use, other, alkaline, chemicals, in, preparations, available, to, consumers, sodium, hydroxide, relaxers, are, still, available, but, they, are, used, mostly, by, professionals, a, solution, of, sodium, hydroxide, in, water, was, traditionally, used, as, the, most, common, paint, stripper, on, wooden, objects, its, use, has, become, less, common, because, it, can, damage, the, wood, surface, raising, the, grain, and, staining, the, colour, sodium, hydroxide, is, sometimes, used, during, water, purification, to, raise, the, ph, of, water, supplies, increased, ph, makes, the, water, less, corrosive, to, plumbing, and, reduces, the, amount, of, lead, copper, and, other, toxic, metals, that, can, dissolve, into, drinking, water, sodium, hydroxide, has, been, used, for, detection, of, carbon, monoxide, poisoning, with, blood, samples, of, such, patients, turning, to, a, vermilion, color, upon, the, addition, of, a, few, drops, of, sodium, hydroxide, today, carbon, monoxide, poisoning, can, be, detected, by, co, oximetry, sodium, hydroxide, is, used, in, some, cement, mix, plasticisers, this, helps, homogenise, cement, mixes, preventing, segregation, of, sands, and, cement, decreases, the, amount, of, water, required, in, a, mix, and, increases, workability, of, the, cement, product, be, it, mortar, render, or, concrete, like, other, corrosive, acids, and, alkalis, a, few, drops, of, sodium, hydroxide, solutions, can, readily, decompose, proteins, and, lipids, in, living, tissues, via, amide, hydrolysis, and, ester, hydrolysis, which, consequently, cause, chemical, burns, and, may, induce, permanent, blindness, upon, contact, with, eyes, solid, alkali, can, also, express, its, corrosive, nature, if, there, is, water, such, as, water, vapor, thus, protective, equipment, like, rubber, gloves, safety, clothing, and, eye, protection, should, always, be, used, when, handling, this, chemical, or, its, solutions, the, standard, first, aid, measures, for, alkali, spills, on, the, skin, is, as, for, other, corrosives, irrigation, with, large, quantities, of, water, washing, is, continued, for, at, least, ten, to, fifteen, minutes, moreover, dissolution, of, sodium, hydroxide, is, highly, exothermic, and, the, resulting, heat, may, cause, heat, burns, or, ignite, flammables, it, also, produces, heat, when, reacted, with, acids, sodium, hydroxide, is, mildly, corrosive, to, glass, which, can, cause, damage, to, glazing, or, cause, ground, glass, joints, to, bind, sodium, hydroxide, is, corrosive, to, several, metals, like, aluminium, which, reacts, with, the, alkali, to, produce, flammable, hydrogen, gas, on, contact, careful, storage, is, needed, when, handling, sodium, hydroxide, for, use, especially, bulk, volumes, following, proper, naoh, storage,

laboratory, use, within, intermediate, bulk, containers, medium, volume, containers, for, cargo, handling, and, transport, or, within, large, stationary, storage, tanks, with, volumes, up, to, 100, 000, gallons, for, manufacturing, or, waste, water, plants, with, extensive, naoh, use, common, materials, that, are, compatible, with, sodium, hydroxide, and, often, utilized, for, naoh, storage, include, polyethylene, hdpe, usual, xlpe, less, common, carbon, steel, polyvinyl, chloride, pvc, stainless, steel, and, fiberglass, reinforced, plastic, frp, with, a, resistant, liner, sodium, hydroxide, must, be, stored, in, airtight, containers, to, preserve, its, normality, as, it, will, absorb, water, from, the, atmosphere, sodium, hydroxide, was, first, prepared, by, soap, makers, p45, a, procedure, for, making, sodium, hydroxide, appeared, as, part, of, a, recipe, for, making, soap, in, an, arab, book, of, the, late, 13th, century, al, mukhtara, fi, funun, min, al, suna, inventions, from, the, various, industrial, arts, which, was, compiled, by, al, muzaffar, yusuf, ibn, umar, ibn, ali, ibn, rasul, d, 1295, a, king, of, yemen, the, recipe, called, for, passing, water, repeatedly, through, a, mixture, of, alkali, arabic, al, qily, where, qily, is, ash, from, saltwort, plants, which, are, rich, in, sodium, hence, alkali, was, impure, sodium, carbonate, and, quicklime, calcium, oxide, cao, whereby, a, solution, of, sodium, hydroxide, was, obtained, european, soap, makers, also, followed, this, recipe, when, in, 1791, the, french, chemist, and, surgeon, nicolas, leblanc, 1742, 1806, patented, a, process, for, mass, producing, sodium, carbonate, natural, soda, ash, impure, sodium, carbonate, that, was, obtained, from, the, ashes, of, plants, that, are, rich, in, sodium, p36, was, replaced, by, this, artificial, version, p46, however, by, the, 20th, century, the, electrolysis, of, sodium, chloride, had, become, the, primary, method, for, producing, sodium, hydroxide
