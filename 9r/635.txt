a, floodplain, or, flood, plain, or, bottomlands, is, an, area, of, land, adjacent, to, a, river, floodplains, stretch, from, the, banks, of, a, river, channel, to, the, base, of, the, enclosing, valley, and, experience, flooding, during, periods, of, high, discharge, the, soils, usually, consist, of, clays, silts, sands, and, gravels, deposited, during, floods, because, of, regular, flooding, floodplains, frequently, have, high, soil, fertility, since, nutrients, are, deposited, with, the, flood, waters, this, can, encourage, farming, some, important, agricultural, regions, such, as, the, nile, and, mississippi, river, basins, heavily, exploit, floodplains, agricultural, and, urban, regions, have, developed, near, or, on, floodplains, to, take, advantage, of, the, rich, soil, and, freshwater, however, the, risk, of, inundation, has, led, to, increasing, efforts, to, control, flooding, most, floodplains, are, formed, by, deposition, on, the, inside, of, river, meanders, and, by, overbank, flow, wherever, the, river, meanders, the, flowing, water, erodes, the, river, bank, on, the, outside, of, the, meander, at, the, same, time, sediments, are, simultaneously, deposited, in, a, point, bar, on, the, inside, of, the, meander, this, is, described, as, lateral, accretion, since, the, deposition, builds, the, point, bar, laterally, into, the, river, channel, erosion, on, the, outside, of, the, meander, usually, closely, balances, deposition, on, the, inside, so, that, the, channel, shifts, in, the, direction, of, the, meander, without, changing, significantly, in, width, the, point, bar, is, built, up, to, a, level, very, close, to, that, of, the, river, banks, significant, net, erosion, of, sediments, occurs, only, when, the, meander, cuts, into, higher, ground, the, overall, effect, is, that, as, the, river, meanders, it, creates, a, level, flood, plain, composed, mostly, of, point, bar, deposits, the, rate, at, which, the, channel, shifts, varies, greatly, with, reported, rates, ranging, from, too, slow, to, measure, to, as, much, as, 2, 400, feet, 730, m, per, year, for, the, kosi, river, of, india, overbank, flow, takes, place, when, the, river, is, flooded, with, more, water, than, can, be, accommodated, by, the, river, channel, flow, over, the, banks, of, the, river, deposits, a, thin, veneer, of, sediments, that, is, coarsest, and, thickest, close, to, the, channel, this, is, described, as, vertical, accretion, since, the, deposits, build, upwards, in, undisturbed, river, systems, overbank, flow, is, frequent, typically, occurring, every, one, to, two, years, regardless, of, climate, or, topography, sedimentation, rates, for, a, three, day, flood, of, the, meuse, and, rhine, rivers, in, 1993, found, average, sedimentation, rates, in, the, floodplain, of, between, 0, 57, and, 1, 0, kg, m, 2, higher, rates, were, found, on, the, levees, 4, kg, m, 2, or, more, and, on, low, lying, areas, 1, 6, kg, m, 2, sedimentation, from, the, overbank, flow, is, concentrated, on, natural, levees, crevasse, splays, and, in, wetlands, and, shallow, lakes, of, flood, basins, natural, levees, are, ridges, along, river, banks, that, form, from, rapid, deposition, from, the, overbank, flow, most, of, the, suspended, sand, is, deposited, on, the, levees, leaving, the, silt, and, clay, sediments, to, be, deposited, as, floodplain, mud, further, from, the, river, levees, are, typically, built, up, enough, to, be, relatively, well, drained, compared, with, nearby, wetlands, and, levees, in, non, arid, climates, are, often, heavily, vegetated, crevasses, are, formed, by, breakout, events, from, the, main, river, channel, the, river, bank, fails, and, floodwaters, scour, a, channel, sediments, from, the, crevasse, spread, out, as, delta, shaped, deposits, with, numerous, distributary, channels, crevasse, formation, is, most, common, in, sections, of, rivers, where, the, river, bed, is, accumulating, sediments, aggrading, repeated, flooding, eventually, builds, up, an, alluvial, ridge, whose, natural, levees, and, abandoned, meander, loops, may, stand, well, above, most, of, the, floodplain, the, alluvial, ridge, is, topped, by, a, channel, belt, formed, by, successive, generations, of, channel, migration, and, meander, cutoff, at, much, longer, intervals, the, river, may, abandon, the, channel, belt, and, build, a, new, one, at, another, position, on, the, floodplain, this, process, is, called, avulsion, and, occurs, at, intervals, of, 10, 1000, years, historical, avulsions, leading, to, catastrophic, flooding, include, the, 1855, yellow, river, flood, and, the, 2008, kosi, river, flood, floodplains, can, form, around, rivers, of, any, kind, or, size, even, relatively, straight, stretches, of, river, are, capable, of, producing, floodplains, mid, channel, bars, in, braided, rivers, migrate, downstream, through, processes, resembling, those, in, point, bars, of, meandering, rivers, and, can, build, up, a, floodplain, the, quantity, of, sediments, in, a, floodplain, greatly, exceeds, the, river, load, of, sediments, thus, floodplains, are, an, important, storage, site, for, sediments, during, their, transport, from, where, they, are, generated, to, their, ultimate, depositional, environment, when, the, rate, at, which, the, river, is, cutting, downwards, becomes, great, enough, that, overbank, flows, become, infrequent, the, river, is, said, to, have, abandoned, its, floodplain, portions, of, the, abandoned, floodplain, may, be, preserved, as, fluvial, terraces, floodplains, support, diverse, and, productive, ecosystems, they, are, characterized, by, considerable, variability, in, space, and, time, which, in, turn, produces, some, of, the, most, species, rich, of, ecosystems, from, the, ecological, perspective, the, most, distinctive, aspect, of, floodplains, is, the, flood, pulse, associated, with, annual, floods, and, so, the, floodplain, ecosystem, is, defined, as, the, part, of, the, river, valley, that, is, regularly, flooded, and, dried, floods, bring, in, detrital, material, rich, in, nutrients, and, release, nutrients, from, dry, soil, as, it, is, flooded, the, decomposition, of, terrestrial, plants, submerged, by, the, floodwaters, adds, to, the, nutrient, supply, the, flooded, littoral, zone, of, the, river, the, zone, closest, to, the, river, bank, provides, an, ideal, environment, for, many, aquatic, species, so, the, spawning, season, for, fish, often, coincides, with, the, onset, of, flooding, fish, must, grow, quickly, during, the, flood, to, survive, the, subsequent, drop, in, water, level, as, the, floodwaters, recede, the, littoral, experiences, blooms, of, microorganisms, while, the, banks, of, the, river, dry, out, and, terrestrial, plants, germinate, to, stabilize, the, bank, the, biota, of, floodplains, has, high, annual, growth, and, mortality, rates, which, is, advantageous, for, the, rapid, colonization, of, large, areas, of, the, floodplain, this, allows, them, to, take, advantage, of, shifting, floodplain, geometry, for, example, floodplain, trees, are, fast, growing, and, tolerant, of, root, disturbance, opportunists, such, as, birds, are, attracted, to, the, rich, food, supply, provided, by, the, flood, pulse, floodplain, ecosystems, have, distinct, biozones, in, europe, as, one, moves, away, from, the, river, the, successive, plant, communities, are, bank, vegetation, usually, annuals, sedge, and, reeds, willow, shrubs, willow, poplar, forest, oak, ash, forest, and, broadleaf, forest, human, disturbance, creates, wet, meadows, that, replace, much, of, the, original, ecosystem, the, biozones, reflect, a, soil, moisture, and, oxygen, gradient, that, in, turn, corresponds, to, a, flooding, frequency, gradient, the, primeval, floodplain, forests, of, europe, were, dominated, by, oak, 60, elm, 20, and, hornbeam, 13, but, human, disturbance, has, shifted, the, makeup, towards, ash, 49, with, maple, increasing, to, 14, and, oak, decreasing, to, 25, semiarid, floodplains, have, a, much, lower, species, diversity, species, are, adapted, to, alternating, drought, and, flood, extreme, drying, can, destroy, the, ability, of, the, floodplain, ecosystem, to, shift, to, a, healthy, wet, phase, when, flooded, floodplain, forests, constituted, 1, of, the, landscape, of, europe, in, the, 1800s, much, of, this, has, been, cleared, by, human, activity, though, floodplain, forests, have, been, impacted, less, than, other, kinds, of, forests, this, makes, them, important, refugia, for, biodiversity, human, destruction, of, floodplain, ecosystems, is, largely, a, result, of, flood, control, hydroelectric, development, such, as, reservoirs, and, conversion, of, floodplains, to, agriculture, use, transportation, and, waste, disposal, also, have, detrimental, effects, the, result, is, the, fragmentation, of, these, ecosystems, resulting, in, loss, of, populations, and, diversity, and, endangering, the, remaining, fragments, of, the, ecosystem, flood, control, creates, a, sharper, boundary, between, water, and, land, than, in, undisturbed, floodplains, reducing, physical, diversity, floodplain, forests, protect, waterways, from, erosion, and, pollution, and, reduce, the, impact, of, floodwaters, the, disturbance, by, humans, of, temperate, floodplain, ecosystems, frustrates, attempts, to, understand, their, natural, behavior, tropical, rivers, are, less, impacted, by, humans, and, provide, models, for, temperate, floodplain, ecosystems, which, are, thought, to, share, many, of, their, ecological, attributes, excluding, famines, and, epidemics, some, of, the, worst, natural, disasters, in, history, measured, by, fatalities, have, been, river, floods, particularly, in, the, yellow, river, in, china, see, list, of, deadliest, floods, the, worst, of, these, and, the, worst, natural, disaster, excluding, famine, and, epidemics, was, the, 1931, china, floods, estimated, to, have, killed, millions, this, had, been, preceded, by, the, 1887, yellow, river, flood, which, killed, around, one, million, people, and, is, the, second, worst, natural, disaster, in, history, the, extent, of, floodplain, inundation, depends, partly, on, flood, magnitude, defined, by, the, return, period, in, the, united, states, the, federal, emergency, management, agency, fema, manages, the, national, flood, insurance, program, nfip, the, nfip, offers, insurance, to, properties, located, within, a, flood, prone, area, as, defined, by, the, flood, insurance, rate, map, firm, which, depicts, various, flood, risks, for, a, community, the, firm, typically, focuses, on, the, delineation, of, the, 100, year, flood, inundation, area, also, known, within, the, nfip, as, the, special, flood, hazard, area, where, a, detailed, study, of, a, waterway, has, been, done, the, 100, year, floodplain, will, also, include, the, floodway, the, critical, portion, of, the, floodplain, which, includes, the, stream, channel, and, any, adjacent, areas, that, must, be, kept, free, of, encroachments, that, might, block, flood, flows, or, restrict, storage, of, flood, waters, another, commonly, encountered, term, is, the, special, flood, hazard, area, which, is, any, area, subject, to, inundation, by, a, 100, year, flood, a, problem, is, that, any, alteration, of, the, watershed, upstream, of, the, point, in, question, can, potentially, affect, the, ability, of, the, watershed, to, handle, water, and, thus, potentially, affects, the, levels, of, the, periodic, floods, a, large, shopping, center, and, parking, lot, for, example, may, raise, the, levels, of, 5, year, 100, year, and, other, floods, but, the, maps, are, rarely, adjusted, and, are, frequently, rendered, obsolete, by, subsequent, development, in, order, for, a, flood, prone, property, to, qualify, for, government, subsidized, insurance, a, local, community, must, adopt, an, ordinance, that, protects, the, floodway, and, requires, that, new, residential, structures, built, in, special, flood, hazard, areas, be, elevated, to, at, least, the, level, of, the, 100, year, flood, commercial, structures, can, be, elevated, or, floodproofed, to, or, above, this, level, in, some, areas, without, detailed, study, information, structures, may, be, required, to, be, elevated, to, at, least, two, feet, above, the, surrounding, grade, many, state, and, local, governments, have, in, addition, adopted, floodplain, construction, regulations, which, are, more, restrictive, than, those, mandated, by, the, nfip, the, us, government, also, sponsors, flood, hazard, mitigation, efforts, to, reduce, flood, impacts, california, s, hazard, mitigation, program, is, one, funding, source, for, mitigation, projects, a, number, of, whole, towns, such, as, english, indiana, have, been, completely, relocated, to, remove, them, from, the, floodplain, other, smaller, scale, mitigation, efforts, include, acquiring, and, demolishing, flood, prone, buildings, or, flood, proofing, them, in, some, floodplains, such, as, the, inner, niger, delta, of, mali, annual, flooding, events, are, a, natural, part, of, the, local, ecology, and, rural, economy, allowing, for, the, raising, of, crops, through, recessional, agriculture, however, in, bangladesh, which, occupies, the, ganges, delta, the, advantages, provided, by, the, richness, of, the, alluvial, soil, of, the, floodplain, are, severely, offset, by, frequent, floods, brought, on, by, cyclones, and, annual, monsoon, rains, these, extreme, weather, events, cause, severe, economic, disruption, and, loss, of, human, life, in, the, densely, populated, region, floodplain, soil, composition, is, unique, and, varies, widely, based, on, microtopography, floodplain, forests, have, high, topographic, heterogeneity, which, creates, variation, in, localized, hydrologic, conditions, soil, moisture, within, the, upper, 30, cm, of, the, soil, profile, also, varies, widely, based, on, microtopography, which, affects, oxygen, availability, floodplain, soil, stays, aerated, for, long, stretches, of, time, in, between, flooding, events, but, during, flooding, saturated, soil, can, become, oxygen, depleted, if, it, stands, stagnant, for, long, enough, more, soil, oxygen, is, available, at, higher, elevations, farther, from, the, river, floodplain, forests, generally, experience, alternating, periods, of, aerobic, and, anaerobic, soil, microbe, activity, which, affects, fine, root, development, and, desiccation, floodplains, have, high, buffering, capacity, for, phosphorus, to, prevent, nutrient, loss, to, river, outputs, phosphorus, nutrient, loading, is, a, problem, in, freshwater, systems, much, of, the, phosphorus, in, freshwater, systems, comes, from, municipal, wastewater, treatment, plants, and, agricultural, runoff, stream, connectivity, controls, whether, phosphorus, cycling, is, mediated, by, floodplain, sediments, or, by, external, processes, under, conditions, of, stream, connectivity, phosphorus, is, better, able, to, be, cycled, and, sediments, and, nutrients, are, more, readily, retained, water, in, freshwater, streams, ends, up, in, either, short, term, storage, in, plants, or, algae, or, long, term, in, sediments, wet, dry, cycling, within, the, floodplain, has, a, big, impact, on, phosphorus, availability, because, it, alters, water, level, redox, state, ph, and, physical, properties, of, minerals, dry, soils, that, were, previously, inundated, have, reduced, availability, of, phosphorus, and, increased, affinity, for, obtaining, phosphorus, human, floodplain, alterations, also, impact, the, phosphorus, cycle, particulate, phosphorus, and, soluble, reactive, phosphorus, srp, can, contribute, to, algal, blooms, and, toxicity, in, waterways, when, the, nitrogen, to, phosphorus, ratios, are, altered, farther, upstream, in, areas, where, the, phosphorus, load, is, primarily, particulate, phosphorus, like, the, mississippi, river, the, most, effective, ways, of, removing, phosphorus, upstream, are, sedimentation, soil, accretion, and, burial, in, basins, where, srp, is, the, primary, form, of, phosphorus, biological, uptake, in, floodplain, forests, is, the, best, way, of, removing, nutrients, phosphorus, can, transform, between, srp, and, particulate, phosphorus, depending, on, ambient, conditions, or, processes, like, decomposition, biological, uptake, redoximorphic, release, and, sedimentation, and, accretion, in, either, phosphorus, form, floodplain, forests, are, beneficial, as, phosphorus, sinks, and, the, human, caused, disconnect, between, floodplains, and, rivers, exacerbates, the, phosphorus, overload, floodplain, soils, tend, to, be, high, in, eco, pollutants, especially, persistent, organic, pollutant, pop, deposition, proper, understanding, of, the, distribution, of, soil, contaminants, is, difficult, because, of, high, variation, in, microtopography, and, soil, texture, within, floodplains
