in, astronomy, and, navigation, the, celestial, sphere, is, an, abstract, sphere, that, has, an, arbitrarily, large, radius, and, is, concentric, to, earth, all, objects, in, the, sky, can, be, conceived, as, being, projected, upon, the, inner, surface, of, the, celestial, sphere, which, may, be, centered, on, earth, or, the, observer, if, centered, on, the, observer, half, of, the, sphere, would, resemble, a, hemispherical, screen, over, the, observing, location, the, celestial, sphere, is, a, conceptual, tool, used, in, spherical, astronomy, to, specify, the, position, of, an, object, in, the, sky, without, consideration, of, its, linear, distance, from, the, observer, the, celestial, equator, divides, the, celestial, sphere, into, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, because, astronomical, objects, are, at, such, remote, distances, casual, observation, of, the, sky, offers, no, information, on, their, actual, distances, all, celestial, objects, seem, equally, far, away, as, if, fixed, onto, the, inside, of, a, sphere, with, a, large, but, unknown, radius, which, appears, to, rotate, westward, overhead, meanwhile, earth, underfoot, seems, to, remain, still, for, purposes, of, spherical, astronomy, which, is, concerned, only, with, the, directions, to, celestial, objects, it, makes, no, difference, if, this, is, actually, the, case, or, if, it, is, earth, that, is, rotating, while, the, celestial, sphere, is, stationary, the, celestial, sphere, can, be, considered, to, be, infinite, in, radius, this, means, any, point, within, it, including, that, occupied, by, the, observer, can, be, considered, the, center, it, also, means, that, all, parallel, lines, be, they, millimetres, apart, or, across, the, solar, system, from, each, other, will, seem, to, intersect, the, sphere, at, a, single, point, analogous, to, the, vanishing, point, of, graphical, perspective, all, parallel, planes, will, seem, to, intersect, the, sphere, in, a, coincident, great, circle, a, vanishing, circle, conversely, observers, looking, toward, the, same, point, on, an, infinite, radius, celestial, sphere, will, be, looking, along, parallel, lines, and, observers, looking, toward, the, same, great, circle, along, parallel, planes, on, an, infinite, radius, celestial, sphere, all, observers, see, the, same, things, in, the, same, direction, for, some, objects, this, is, over, simplified, objects, which, are, relatively, near, to, the, observer, for, instance, the, moon, will, seem, to, change, position, against, the, distant, celestial, sphere, if, the, observer, moves, far, enough, say, from, one, side, of, planet, earth, to, the, other, this, effect, known, as, parallax, can, be, represented, as, a, small, offset, from, a, mean, position, the, celestial, sphere, can, be, considered, to, be, centered, at, the, earth, s, center, the, sun, s, center, or, any, other, convenient, location, and, offsets, from, positions, referred, to, these, centers, can, be, calculated, in, this, way, astronomers, can, predict, geocentric, or, heliocentric, positions, of, objects, on, the, celestial, sphere, without, the, need, to, calculate, the, individual, geometry, of, any, particular, observer, and, the, utility, of, the, celestial, sphere, is, maintained, individual, observers, can, work, out, their, own, small, offsets, from, the, mean, positions, if, necessary, in, many, cases, in, astronomy, the, offsets, are, insignificant, the, celestial, sphere, can, thus, be, thought, of, as, a, kind, of, astronomical, shorthand, and, is, applied, very, frequently, by, astronomers, for, instance, the, astronomical, almanac, for, 2010, lists, the, apparent, geocentric, position, of, the, moon, on, january, 1, at, 00, 00, 00, 00, terrestrial, time, in, equatorial, coordinates, as, right, ascension, 6, h, 57, m, 48, 86, s, declination, 23, 30, 05, 5, implied, in, this, position, is, that, it, is, as, projected, onto, the, celestial, sphere, any, observer, at, any, location, looking, in, that, direction, would, see, the, geocentric, moon, in, the, same, place, against, the, stars, for, many, rough, uses, e, g, calculating, an, approximate, phase, of, the, moon, this, position, as, seen, from, the, earth, s, center, is, adequate, for, applications, requiring, precision, e, g, calculating, the, shadow, path, of, an, eclipse, the, almanac, gives, formulae, and, methods, for, calculating, the, topocentric, coordinates, that, is, as, seen, from, a, particular, place, on, the, earth, s, surface, based, on, the, geocentric, position, this, greatly, abbreviates, the, amount, of, detail, necessary, in, such, almanacs, as, each, observer, can, handle, their, own, specific, circumstances, celestial, spheres, or, celestial, orbs, were, envisioned, to, be, perfect, and, divine, entities, initially, from, greek, astronomers, such, as, aristotle, he, composed, a, set, of, principles, called, aristotelian, physics, that, outlined, the, natural, order, and, structure, of, the, world, like, other, greek, astronomers, aristotle, also, thought, the, celestial, sphere, as, the, frame, of, reference, for, their, geometric, theories, of, the, motions, of, the, heavenly, bodies, with, his, adoption, of, eudoxus, of, cnidus, theory, aristotle, had, described, celestial, bodies, within, the, celestial, sphere, to, be, filled, with, pureness, perfect, and, quintessence, the, fifth, element, that, was, known, to, be, divine, and, purity, according, to, aristotle, aristotle, deemed, the, sun, moon, planets, and, the, fixed, stars, to, be, perfectly, concentric, spheres, in, a, superlunary, region, above, the, sublunary, sphere, aristotle, had, asserted, that, these, bodies, in, the, superlunary, region, are, perfect, and, cannot, be, corrupted, by, any, of, the, classical, elements, fire, water, air, and, earth, corruptible, elements, were, only, contained, in, the, sublunary, region, and, incorruptible, elements, were, in, the, superlunary, region, of, aristotle, s, geocentric, model, aristotle, had, the, notion, that, celestial, orbs, must, exhibit, celestial, motion, a, perfect, circular, motion, that, goes, on, for, eternity, he, also, argued, that, the, behavior, and, property, follows, strictly, to, a, principle, of, natural, place, where, the, quintessential, element, moves, freely, of, divine, will, while, other, elements, fire, air, water, and, earth, are, corruptible, subject, to, change, and, imperfection, aristotle, s, key, concepts, rely, on, the, nature, of, the, five, elements, distinguishing, the, earth, and, the, heavens, in, the, astronomical, reality, taking, eudoxus, s, model, of, separate, spheres, numerous, discoveries, from, aristotle, and, eudoxus, approximately, 395, b, c, to, 337, b, c, have, sparked, differences, in, both, of, their, models, and, sharing, similar, properties, simultaneously, aristotle, and, eudoxus, claimed, two, different, counts, of, spheres, in, the, heavens, according, to, eudoxus, there, were, only, 27, spheres, in, the, heavens, while, there, are, 55, spheres, in, aristotle, s, model, eudoxus, attempted, to, construct, his, model, mathematically, from, a, treatise, known, as, on, speeds, greek, and, asserted, the, shape, of, the, hippopede, or, lemniscate, was, associated, with, planetary, retrogression, aristotle, emphasized, that, the, speed, of, the, celestial, orbs, is, unchanging, like, the, heavens, while, eudoxus, emphasized, that, the, orbs, are, in, a, perfect, geometrical, shape, eudoxus, s, spheres, would, produce, undesirable, motions, to, the, lower, region, of, the, planets, while, aristotle, introduced, unrollers, between, each, set, of, active, spheres, to, counteract, the, motions, of, the, outer, set, or, else, the, outer, motions, will, be, transferred, to, the, outer, planets, aristotle, would, later, observe, the, motions, of, the, planets, by, using, the, combinations, of, nested, spheres, and, circular, motions, in, creative, ways, but, further, observations, kept, undoing, their, work, aside, from, aristotle, and, eudoxus, empedocles, gave, an, explanation, that, the, motion, of, the, heavens, moving, about, it, at, divine, relatively, high, speed, puts, the, earth, in, a, stationary, position, due, to, the, circular, motion, preventing, the, downward, movement, from, natural, causes, aristotle, criticized, empedocles, s, model, arguing, that, all, heavy, objects, go, towards, the, earth, and, not, the, whirl, itself, coming, to, earth, he, ridiculed, it, and, claimed, that, empedocles, s, statement, was, extremely, absurd, anything, that, defied, the, motion, of, natural, place, and, the, unchanging, heavens, including, the, celestial, spheres, was, criticized, immediately, by, aristotle, these, concepts, are, important, for, understanding, celestial, coordinate, systems, frameworks, for, measuring, the, positions, of, objects, in, the, sky, certain, reference, lines, and, planes, on, earth, when, projected, onto, the, celestial, sphere, form, the, bases, of, the, reference, systems, these, include, the, earth, s, equator, axis, and, orbit, at, their, intersections, with, the, celestial, sphere, these, form, the, celestial, equator, the, north, and, south, celestial, poles, and, the, ecliptic, respectively, as, the, celestial, sphere, is, considered, arbitrary, or, infinite, in, radius, all, observers, see, the, celestial, equator, celestial, poles, and, ecliptic, at, the, same, place, against, the, background, stars, from, these, bases, directions, toward, objects, in, the, sky, can, be, quantified, by, constructing, celestial, coordinate, systems, similar, to, geographic, longitude, and, latitude, the, equatorial, coordinate, system, specifies, positions, relative, to, the, celestial, equator, and, celestial, poles, using, right, ascension, and, declination, the, ecliptic, coordinate, system, specifies, positions, relative, to, the, ecliptic, earth, s, orbit, using, ecliptic, longitude, and, latitude, besides, the, equatorial, and, ecliptic, systems, some, other, celestial, coordinate, systems, like, the, galactic, coordinate, system, are, more, appropriate, for, particular, purposes, the, ancient, greeks, assumed, the, literal, truth, of, stars, attached, to, a, celestial, sphere, revolving, about, the, earth, in, one, day, and, a, fixed, earth, the, eudoxan, planetary, model, on, which, the, aristotelian, and, ptolemaic, models, were, based, was, the, first, geometric, explanation, for, the, wandering, of, the, classical, planets, the, outermost, of, these, crystal, spheres, was, thought, to, carry, the, fixed, stars, eudoxus, used, 27, concentric, spherical, solids, to, answer, plato, s, challenge, by, the, assumption, of, what, uniform, and, orderly, motions, can, the, apparent, motions, of, the, planets, be, accounted, for, anaxagoras, in, the, mid, 5th, century, bc, was, the, first, known, philosopher, to, suggest, that, the, stars, were, fiery, stones, too, far, away, for, their, heat, to, be, felt, similar, ideas, were, expressed, by, aristarchus, of, samos, however, they, did, not, enter, mainstream, european, and, islamic, astronomy, of, the, late, ancient, and, medieval, period, copernican, heliocentrism, did, away, with, the, planetary, spheres, but, it, did, not, necessarily, preclude, the, existence, of, a, sphere, for, the, fixed, stars, the, first, astronomer, of, the, european, renaissance, to, suggest, that, the, stars, were, distant, suns, was, giordano, bruno, in, his, de, l, infinito, universo, et, mondi, 1584, this, idea, was, among, the, charges, albeit, not, in, a, prominent, position, brought, against, him, by, the, inquisition, the, idea, became, mainstream, in, the, later, 17th, century, especially, following, the, publication, of, conversations, on, the, plurality, of, worlds, by, bernard, le, bovier, de, fontenelle, 1686, and, by, the, early, 18th, century, it, was, the, default, working, assumptions, in, stellar, astronomy, a, celestial, sphere, can, also, refer, to, a, physical, model, of, the, celestial, sphere, or, celestial, globe, such, globes, map, the, constellations, on, the, outside, of, a, sphere, resulting, in, a, mirror, image, of, the, constellations, as, seen, from, earth, the, oldest, surviving, example, of, such, an, artifact, is, the, globe, of, the, farnese, atlas, sculpture, a, 2nd, century, copy, of, an, older, hellenistic, period, ca, 120, bce, work, observers, on, other, worlds, would, of, course, see, objects, in, that, sky, under, much, the, same, conditions, as, if, projected, onto, a, dome, coordinate, systems, based, on, the, sky, of, that, world, could, be, constructed, these, could, be, based, on, the, equivalent, ecliptic, poles, and, equator, although, the, reasons, for, building, a, system, that, way, are, as, much, historic, as, technical
