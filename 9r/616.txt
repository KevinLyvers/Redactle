seismology, s, a, z, m, l, d, i, s, a, s, from, ancient, greek, seism, s, meaning, earthquake, and, log, a, meaning, study, of, is, the, scientific, study, of, earthquakes, or, generally, quakes, and, the, generation, and, propagation, of, elastic, waves, through, the, earth, or, other, planetary, bodies, it, also, includes, studies, of, earthquake, environmental, effects, such, as, tsunamis, as, well, as, diverse, seismic, sources, such, as, volcanic, tectonic, glacial, fluvial, oceanic, microseism, atmospheric, and, artificial, processes, such, as, explosions, and, human, activities, a, related, field, that, uses, geology, to, infer, information, regarding, past, earthquakes, is, paleoseismology, a, recording, of, earth, motion, as, a, function, of, time, created, by, a, seismograph, is, called, a, seismogram, a, seismologist, is, a, scientist, works, in, basic, or, applied, seismology, scholarly, interest, in, earthquakes, can, be, traced, back, to, antiquity, early, speculations, on, the, natural, causes, of, earthquakes, were, included, in, the, writings, of, thales, of, miletus, c, 585, bce, anaximenes, of, miletus, c, 550, bce, aristotle, c, 340, bce, and, zhang, heng, 132, ce, in, 132, ce, zhang, heng, of, china, s, han, dynasty, designed, the, first, known, seismoscope, in, the, 17th, century, athanasius, kircher, argued, that, earthquakes, were, caused, by, the, movement, of, fire, within, a, system, of, channels, inside, the, earth, martin, lister, 1638, 1712, and, nicolas, lemery, 1645, 1715, proposed, that, earthquakes, were, caused, by, chemical, explosions, within, the, earth, the, lisbon, earthquake, of, 1755, coinciding, with, the, general, flowering, of, science, in, europe, set, in, motion, intensified, scientific, attempts, to, understand, the, behaviour, and, causation, of, earthquakes, the, earliest, responses, include, work, by, john, bevis, 1757, and, john, michell, 1761, michell, determined, that, earthquakes, originate, within, the, earth, and, were, waves, of, movement, caused, by, shifting, masses, of, rock, miles, below, the, surface, in, response, to, a, series, of, earthquakes, near, comrie, in, scotland, in, 1839, a, committee, was, formed, in, the, united, kingdom, in, order, to, produce, better, detection, methods, for, earthquakes, the, outcome, of, this, was, the, production, of, one, of, the, first, modern, seismometers, by, james, david, forbes, first, presented, in, a, report, by, david, milne, home, in, 1842, this, seismometer, was, an, inverted, pendulum, which, recorded, the, measurements, of, seismic, activity, through, the, use, of, a, pencil, placed, on, paper, above, the, pendulum, the, designs, provided, did, not, prove, effective, according, to, milne, s, reports, from, 1857, robert, mallet, laid, the, foundation, of, modern, instrumental, seismology, and, carried, out, seismological, experiments, using, explosives, he, is, also, responsible, for, coining, the, word, seismology, in, 1897, emil, wiechert, s, theoretical, calculations, led, him, to, conclude, that, the, earth, s, interior, consists, of, a, mantle, of, silicates, surrounding, a, core, of, iron, in, 1906, richard, dixon, oldham, identified, the, separate, arrival, of, p, waves, s, waves, and, surface, waves, on, seismograms, and, found, the, first, clear, evidence, that, the, earth, has, a, central, core, in, 1909, andrija, mohorovi, i, one, of, the, founders, of, modern, seismology, discovered, and, defined, the, mohorovi, i, discontinuity, usually, referred, to, as, the, moho, discontinuity, or, the, moho, it, is, the, boundary, between, the, earth, s, crust, and, the, mantle, it, is, defined, by, the, distinct, change, in, velocity, of, seismological, waves, as, they, pass, through, changing, densities, of, rock, in, 1910, after, studying, the, april, 1906, san, francisco, earthquake, harry, fielding, reid, put, forward, the, elastic, rebound, theory, which, remains, the, foundation, for, modern, tectonic, studies, the, development, of, this, theory, depended, on, the, considerable, progress, of, earlier, independent, streams, of, work, on, the, behavior, of, elastic, materials, and, in, mathematics, an, early, scientific, study, of, aftershocks, from, a, destructive, earthquake, came, after, the, january, 1920, xalapa, earthquake, an, 80, kg, 180, lb, wiechert, seismograph, was, brought, to, the, mexican, city, of, xalapa, by, rail, after, the, earthquake, the, instrument, was, deployed, to, record, its, aftershocks, data, from, the, seismograph, would, eventually, determine, that, the, mainshock, was, produced, along, a, shallow, crustal, fault, in, 1926, harold, jeffreys, was, the, first, to, claim, based, on, his, study, of, earthquake, waves, that, below, the, mantle, the, core, of, the, earth, is, liquid, in, 1937, inge, lehmann, determined, that, within, earth, s, liquid, outer, core, there, is, a, solid, inner, core, by, the, 1960s, earth, science, had, developed, to, the, point, where, a, comprehensive, theory, of, the, causation, of, seismic, events, and, geodetic, motions, had, come, together, in, the, now, well, established, theory, of, plate, tectonics, seismic, waves, are, elastic, waves, that, propagate, in, solid, or, fluid, materials, they, can, be, divided, into, body, waves, that, travel, through, the, interior, of, the, materials, surface, waves, that, travel, along, surfaces, or, interfaces, between, materials, and, normal, modes, a, form, of, standing, wave, there, are, two, types, of, body, waves, pressure, waves, or, primary, waves, p, waves, and, shear, or, secondary, waves, s, waves, p, waves, are, longitudinal, waves, that, involve, compression, and, expansion, in, the, direction, that, the, wave, is, moving, and, are, always, the, first, waves, to, appear, on, a, seismogram, as, they, are, the, fastest, moving, waves, through, solids, s, waves, are, transverse, waves, that, move, perpendicular, to, the, direction, of, propagation, s, waves, are, slower, than, p, waves, therefore, they, appear, later, than, p, waves, on, a, seismogram, fluids, cannot, support, transverse, elastic, waves, because, of, their, low, shear, strength, so, s, waves, only, travel, in, solids, surface, waves, are, the, result, of, p, and, s, waves, interacting, with, the, surface, of, the, earth, these, waves, are, dispersive, meaning, that, different, frequencies, have, different, velocities, the, two, main, surface, wave, types, are, rayleigh, waves, which, have, both, compressional, and, shear, motions, and, love, waves, which, are, purely, shear, rayleigh, waves, result, from, the, interaction, of, p, waves, and, vertically, polarized, s, waves, with, the, surface, and, can, exist, in, any, solid, medium, love, waves, are, formed, by, horizontally, polarized, s, waves, interacting, with, the, surface, and, can, only, exist, if, there, is, a, change, in, the, elastic, properties, with, depth, in, a, solid, medium, which, is, always, the, case, in, seismological, applications, surface, waves, travel, more, slowly, than, p, waves, and, s, waves, because, they, are, the, result, of, these, waves, traveling, along, indirect, paths, to, interact, with, earth, s, surface, because, they, travel, along, the, surface, of, the, earth, their, energy, decays, less, rapidly, than, body, waves, 1, distance, 2, vs, 1, distance, 3, and, thus, the, shaking, caused, by, surface, waves, is, generally, stronger, than, that, of, body, waves, and, the, primary, surface, waves, are, often, thus, the, largest, signals, on, earthquake, seismograms, surface, waves, are, strongly, excited, when, their, source, is, close, to, the, surface, as, in, a, shallow, earthquake, or, a, near, surface, explosion, and, are, much, weaker, for, deep, earthquake, sources, both, body, and, surface, waves, are, traveling, waves, however, large, earthquakes, can, also, make, the, entire, earth, ring, like, a, resonant, bell, this, ringing, is, a, mixture, of, normal, modes, with, discrete, frequencies, and, periods, of, approximately, an, hour, or, shorter, normal, mode, motion, caused, by, a, very, large, earthquake, can, be, observed, for, up, to, a, month, after, the, event, the, first, observations, of, normal, modes, were, made, in, the, 1960s, as, the, advent, of, higher, fidelity, instruments, coincided, with, two, of, the, largest, earthquakes, of, the, 20th, century, the, 1960, valdivia, earthquake, and, the, 1964, alaska, earthquake, since, then, the, normal, modes, of, the, earth, have, given, us, some, of, the, strongest, constraints, on, the, deep, structure, of, the, earth, one, of, the, first, attempts, at, the, scientific, study, of, earthquakes, followed, the, 1755, lisbon, earthquake, other, notable, earthquakes, that, spurred, major, advancements, in, the, science, of, seismology, include, the, 1857, basilicata, earthquake, the, 1906, san, francisco, earthquake, the, 1964, alaska, earthquake, the, 2004, sumatra, andaman, earthquake, and, the, 2011, great, east, japan, earthquake, seismic, waves, produced, by, explosions, or, vibrating, controlled, sources, are, one, of, the, primary, methods, of, underground, exploration, in, geophysics, in, addition, to, many, different, electromagnetic, methods, such, as, induced, polarization, and, magnetotellurics, controlled, source, seismology, has, been, used, to, map, salt, domes, anticlines, and, other, geologic, traps, in, petroleum, bearing, rocks, faults, rock, types, and, long, buried, giant, meteor, craters, for, example, the, chicxulub, crater, which, was, caused, by, an, impact, that, has, been, implicated, in, the, extinction, of, the, dinosaurs, was, localized, to, central, america, by, analyzing, ejecta, in, the, cretaceous, paleogene, boundary, and, then, physically, proven, to, exist, using, seismic, maps, from, oil, exploration, seismometers, are, sensors, that, detect, and, record, the, motion, of, the, earth, arising, from, elastic, waves, seismometers, may, be, deployed, at, the, earth, s, surface, in, shallow, vaults, in, boreholes, or, underwater, a, complete, instrument, package, that, records, seismic, signals, is, called, a, seismograph, networks, of, seismographs, continuously, record, ground, motions, around, the, world, to, facilitate, the, monitoring, and, analysis, of, global, earthquakes, and, other, sources, of, seismic, activity, rapid, location, of, earthquakes, makes, tsunami, warnings, possible, because, seismic, waves, travel, considerably, faster, than, tsunami, waves, seismometers, also, record, signals, from, non, earthquake, sources, ranging, from, explosions, nuclear, and, chemical, to, local, noise, from, wind, or, anthropogenic, activities, to, incessant, signals, generated, at, the, ocean, floor, and, coasts, induced, by, ocean, waves, the, global, microseism, to, cryospheric, events, associated, with, large, icebergs, and, glaciers, above, ocean, meteor, strikes, with, energies, as, high, as, 4, 2, 10, 13, j, equivalent, to, that, released, by, an, explosion, of, ten, kilotons, of, tnt, have, been, recorded, by, seismographs, as, have, a, number, of, industrial, accidents, and, terrorist, bombs, and, events, a, field, of, study, referred, to, as, forensic, seismology, a, major, long, term, motivation, for, the, global, seismographic, monitoring, has, been, for, the, detection, and, study, of, nuclear, testing, because, seismic, waves, commonly, propagate, efficiently, as, they, interact, with, the, internal, structure, of, the, earth, they, provide, high, resolution, noninvasive, methods, for, studying, the, planet, s, interior, one, of, the, earliest, important, discoveries, suggested, by, richard, dixon, oldham, in, 1906, and, definitively, shown, by, harold, jeffreys, in, 1926, was, that, the, outer, core, of, the, earth, is, liquid, since, s, waves, do, not, pass, through, liquids, the, liquid, core, causes, a, shadow, on, the, side, of, the, planet, opposite, the, earthquake, where, no, direct, s, waves, are, observed, in, addition, p, waves, travel, much, slower, through, the, outer, core, than, the, mantle, processing, readings, from, many, seismometers, using, seismic, tomography, seismologists, have, mapped, the, mantle, of, the, earth, to, a, resolution, of, several, hundred, kilometers, this, has, enabled, scientists, to, identify, convection, cells, and, other, large, scale, features, such, as, the, large, low, shear, velocity, provinces, near, the, core, mantle, boundary, forecasting, a, probable, timing, location, magnitude, and, other, important, features, of, a, forthcoming, seismic, event, is, called, earthquake, prediction, various, attempts, have, been, made, by, seismologists, and, others, to, create, effective, systems, for, precise, earthquake, predictions, including, the, van, method, most, seismologists, do, not, believe, that, a, system, to, provide, timely, warnings, for, individual, earthquakes, has, yet, been, developed, and, many, believe, that, such, a, system, would, be, unlikely, to, give, useful, warning, of, impending, seismic, events, however, more, general, forecasts, routinely, predict, seismic, hazard, such, forecasts, estimate, the, probability, of, an, earthquake, of, a, particular, size, affecting, a, particular, location, within, a, particular, time, span, and, they, are, routinely, used, in, earthquake, engineering, public, controversy, over, earthquake, prediction, erupted, after, italian, authorities, indicted, six, seismologists, and, one, government, official, for, manslaughter, in, connection, with, a, magnitude, 6, 3, earthquake, in, l, aquila, italy, on, april, 5, 2009, a, report, in, nature, stated, that, the, indictment, was, widely, seen, in, italy, and, abroad, as, being, for, failing, to, predict, the, earthquake, and, drew, condemnation, from, the, american, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, and, the, american, geophysical, union, however, the, magazine, also, indicated, that, the, population, of, aquila, do, not, consider, the, failure, to, predict, the, earthquake, to, be, the, reason, for, the, indictment, but, rather, the, alleged, failure, of, the, scientists, to, evaluate, and, communicate, risk, the, indictment, claims, that, at, a, special, meeting, in, l, aquila, the, week, before, the, earthquake, occurred, scientists, and, officials, were, more, interested, in, pacifying, the, population, than, providing, adequate, information, about, earthquake, risk, and, preparedness, in, locations, where, a, historical, record, exists, it, may, be, used, to, estimate, the, timing, location, and, magnitude, of, future, seismic, events, there, are, several, interpretative, factors, to, consider, the, epicentres, or, foci, and, magnitudes, of, historical, earthquakes, are, subject, to, interpretation, meaning, it, is, possible, that, 5, 6, mw, earthquakes, described, in, the, historical, record, could, be, larger, events, occurring, elsewhere, that, were, felt, moderately, in, the, populated, areas, that, produced, written, records, documentation, in, the, historic, period, may, be, sparse, or, incomplete, and, not, give, a, full, picture, of, the, geographic, scope, of, an, earthquake, or, the, historical, record, may, only, have, earthquake, records, spanning, a, few, centuries, a, very, short, time, frame, in, a, seismic, cycle, engineering, seismology, is, the, study, and, application, of, seismology, for, engineering, purposes, it, generally, applied, to, the, branch, of, seismology, that, deals, with, the, assessment, of, the, seismic, hazard, of, a, site, or, region, for, the, purposes, of, earthquake, engineering, it, is, therefore, a, link, between, earth, science, and, civil, engineering, there, are, two, principal, components, of, engineering, seismology, firstly, studying, earthquake, history, e, g, historical, and, instrumental, catalogs, of, seismicity, and, tectonics, to, assess, the, earthquakes, that, could, occur, in, a, region, and, their, characteristics, and, frequency, of, occurrence, secondly, studying, strong, ground, motions, generated, by, earthquakes, to, assess, the, expected, shaking, from, future, earthquakes, with, similar, characteristics, these, strong, ground, motions, could, either, be, observations, from, accelerometers, or, seismometers, or, those, simulated, by, computers, using, various, techniques, which, are, then, often, used, to, develop, ground, motion, prediction, equations, or, ground, motion, models, seismological, instruments, can, generate, large, amounts, of, data, systems, for, processing, such, data, include
