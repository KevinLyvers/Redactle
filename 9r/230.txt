a, planet, is, a, large, rounded, astronomical, body, that, is, generally, required, to, be, in, orbit, around, a, star, stellar, remnant, or, brown, dwarf, and, is, not, one, itself, the, solar, system, has, eight, planets, by, the, most, restrictive, definition, of, the, term, the, terrestrial, planets, mercury, venus, earth, and, mars, and, the, giant, planets, jupiter, saturn, uranus, and, neptune, the, best, available, theory, of, planet, formation, is, the, nebular, hypothesis, which, posits, that, an, interstellar, cloud, collapses, out, of, a, nebula, to, create, a, young, protostar, orbited, by, a, protoplanetary, disk, planets, grow, in, this, disk, by, the, gradual, accumulation, of, material, driven, by, gravity, a, process, called, accretion, the, word, planet, comes, from, the, greek, plan, tai, wanderers, in, antiquity, this, word, referred, to, the, sun, moon, and, five, points, of, light, visible, to, the, naked, eye, that, moved, across, the, background, of, the, stars, namely, mercury, venus, mars, jupiter, and, saturn, planets, have, historically, had, religious, associations, multiple, cultures, identified, celestial, bodies, with, gods, and, these, connections, with, mythology, and, folklore, persist, in, the, schemes, for, naming, newly, discovered, solar, system, bodies, earth, itself, was, recognized, as, a, planet, when, heliocentrism, supplanted, geocentrism, during, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, with, the, development, of, the, telescope, the, meaning, of, planet, broadened, to, include, objects, only, visible, with, assistance, the, moons, of, the, planets, beyond, earth, the, ice, giants, uranus, and, neptune, ceres, and, other, bodies, later, recognized, to, be, part, of, the, asteroid, belt, and, pluto, later, found, to, be, the, largest, member, of, the, collection, of, icy, bodies, known, as, the, kuiper, belt, the, discovery, of, other, large, objects, in, the, kuiper, belt, particularly, eris, spurred, debate, about, how, exactly, to, define, a, planet, in, 2006, the, international, astronomical, union, iau, adopted, a, definition, of, a, planet, in, the, solar, system, placing, the, four, terrestrial, planets, and, the, four, giant, planets, in, the, planet, category, ceres, pluto, and, eris, are, in, the, category, of, dwarf, planet, many, planetary, scientists, have, nonetheless, continued, to, apply, the, term, planet, more, broadly, including, dwarf, planets, as, well, as, rounded, satellites, like, the, moon, further, advances, in, astronomy, led, to, the, discovery, of, over, five, thousand, planets, outside, the, solar, system, termed, exoplanets, these, often, show, unusual, features, that, the, solar, system, planets, do, not, show, such, as, hot, jupiters, giant, planets, that, orbit, close, to, their, parent, stars, like, 51, pegasi, b, and, extremely, eccentric, orbits, such, as, hd, 20782, b, the, discovery, of, brown, dwarfs, and, planets, larger, than, jupiter, also, spurred, debate, on, the, definition, regarding, where, exactly, to, draw, the, line, between, a, planet, and, a, star, multiple, exoplanets, have, been, found, to, orbit, in, the, habitable, zones, of, their, stars, where, liquid, water, can, potentially, exist, on, a, planetary, surface, but, earth, remains, the, only, planet, known, to, support, life, it, is, not, known, with, certainty, how, planets, are, formed, the, prevailing, theory, is, that, they, coalesce, during, the, collapse, of, a, nebula, into, a, thin, disk, of, gas, and, dust, a, protostar, forms, at, the, core, surrounded, by, a, rotating, protoplanetary, disk, through, accretion, a, process, of, sticky, collision, dust, particles, in, the, disk, steadily, accumulate, mass, to, form, ever, larger, bodies, local, concentrations, of, mass, known, as, planetesimals, form, and, these, accelerate, the, accretion, process, by, drawing, in, additional, material, by, their, gravitational, attraction, these, concentrations, become, ever, denser, until, they, collapse, inward, under, gravity, to, form, protoplanets, after, a, planet, reaches, a, mass, somewhat, larger, than, mars, s, mass, it, begins, to, accumulate, an, extended, atmosphere, greatly, increasing, the, capture, rate, of, the, planetesimals, by, means, of, atmospheric, drag, depending, on, the, accretion, history, of, solids, and, gas, a, giant, planet, an, ice, giant, or, a, terrestrial, planet, may, result, it, is, thought, that, the, regular, satellites, of, jupiter, saturn, and, uranus, formed, in, a, similar, way, however, triton, was, likely, captured, by, neptune, and, earth, s, moon, and, pluto, s, charon, might, have, formed, in, collisions, when, the, protostar, has, grown, such, that, it, ignites, to, form, a, star, the, surviving, disk, is, removed, from, the, inside, outward, by, photoevaporation, the, solar, wind, poynting, robertson, drag, and, other, effects, thereafter, there, still, may, be, many, protoplanets, orbiting, the, star, or, each, other, but, over, time, many, will, collide, either, to, form, a, larger, combined, protoplanet, or, release, material, for, other, protoplanets, to, absorb, those, objects, that, have, become, massive, enough, will, capture, most, matter, in, their, orbital, neighbourhoods, to, become, planets, protoplanets, that, have, avoided, collisions, may, become, natural, satellites, of, planets, through, a, process, of, gravitational, capture, or, remain, in, belts, of, other, objects, to, become, either, dwarf, planets, or, small, bodies, the, energetic, impacts, of, the, smaller, planetesimals, as, well, as, radioactive, decay, will, heat, up, the, growing, planet, causing, it, to, at, least, partially, melt, the, interior, of, the, planet, begins, to, differentiate, by, density, with, higher, density, materials, sinking, toward, the, core, smaller, terrestrial, planets, lose, most, of, their, atmospheres, because, of, this, accretion, but, the, lost, gases, can, be, replaced, by, outgassing, from, the, mantle, and, from, the, subsequent, impact, of, comets, smaller, planets, will, lose, any, atmosphere, they, gain, through, various, escape, mechanisms, with, the, discovery, and, observation, of, planetary, systems, around, stars, other, than, the, sun, it, is, becoming, possible, to, elaborate, revise, or, even, replace, this, account, the, level, of, metallicity, an, astronomical, term, describing, the, abundance, of, chemical, elements, with, an, atomic, number, greater, than, 2, helium, appears, to, determine, the, likelihood, that, a, star, will, have, planets, hence, a, metal, rich, population, i, star, is, more, likely, to, have, a, substantial, planetary, system, than, a, metal, poor, population, ii, star, according, to, the, iau, definition, there, are, eight, planets, in, the, solar, system, which, are, in, increasing, distance, from, the, sun, mercury, venus, earth, mars, jupiter, saturn, uranus, and, neptune, jupiter, is, the, largest, at, 318, earth, masses, whereas, mercury, is, the, smallest, at, 0, 055, earth, masses, the, planets, of, the, solar, system, can, be, divided, into, categories, based, on, their, composition, terrestrials, are, similar, to, earth, with, bodies, largely, composed, of, rock, and, metal, mercury, venus, earth, and, mars, earth, is, the, largest, terrestrial, planet, giant, planets, are, significantly, more, massive, than, the, terrestrials, jupiter, saturn, uranus, and, neptune, they, differ, from, the, terrestrial, planets, in, composition, the, gas, giants, jupiter, and, saturn, are, primarily, composed, of, hydrogen, and, helium, and, are, the, most, massive, planets, in, the, solar, system, saturn, is, one, third, as, massive, as, jupiter, at, 95, earth, masses, the, ice, giants, uranus, and, neptune, are, primarily, composed, of, low, boiling, point, materials, such, as, water, methane, and, ammonia, with, thick, atmospheres, of, hydrogen, and, helium, they, have, a, significantly, lower, mass, than, the, gas, giants, only, 14, and, 17, earth, masses, dwarf, planets, are, gravitationally, rounded, but, have, not, cleared, their, orbits, of, other, bodies, in, increasing, order, of, average, distance, from, the, sun, the, ones, generally, agreed, among, astronomers, are, ceres, orcus, pluto, haumea, quaoar, makemake, gonggong, eris, and, sedna, ceres, is, the, largest, object, in, the, asteroid, belt, located, between, the, orbits, of, mars, and, jupiter, the, other, eight, all, orbit, beyond, neptune, orcus, pluto, haumea, quaoar, and, makemake, orbit, in, the, kuiper, belt, which, is, a, second, belt, of, small, solar, system, bodies, beyond, the, orbit, of, neptune, gonggong, and, eris, orbit, in, the, scattered, disc, which, is, somewhat, further, out, and, unlike, the, kuiper, belt, is, unstable, towards, interactions, with, neptune, sedna, is, the, largest, known, detached, object, a, population, that, never, comes, close, enough, to, the, sun, to, interact, with, any, of, the, classical, planets, the, origins, of, their, orbits, are, still, being, debated, all, nine, are, similar, to, terrestrial, planets, in, having, a, solid, surface, but, they, are, made, of, ice, and, rock, rather, than, rock, and, metal, moreover, all, of, them, are, smaller, than, mercury, with, pluto, being, the, largest, known, dwarf, planet, and, eris, being, the, most, massive, there, are, at, least, nineteen, planetary, mass, moons, or, satellite, planets, moons, large, enough, to, take, on, ellipsoidal, shapes, the, moon, io, and, europa, have, compositions, similar, to, the, terrestrial, planets, the, others, are, made, of, ice, and, rock, like, the, dwarf, planets, with, tethys, being, made, of, almost, pure, ice, europa, is, often, considered, an, icy, planet, though, because, its, surface, ice, layer, makes, it, difficult, to, study, its, interior, ganymede, and, titan, are, larger, than, mercury, by, radius, and, callisto, almost, equals, it, but, all, three, are, much, less, massive, mimas, is, the, smallest, object, generally, agreed, to, be, a, geophysical, planet, at, about, six, millionths, of, earth, s, mass, though, there, are, many, larger, bodies, that, may, not, be, geophysical, planets, e, g, salacia, an, exoplanet, is, a, planet, outside, the, solar, system, as, of, 24, july, 2024, there, are, 7, 026, confirmed, exoplanets, in, 4, 949, planetary, systems, with, 1007, systems, having, more, than, one, planet, known, exoplanets, range, in, size, from, gas, giants, about, twice, as, large, as, jupiter, down, to, just, over, the, size, of, the, moon, analysis, of, gravitational, microlensing, data, suggests, a, minimum, average, of, 1, 6, bound, planets, for, every, star, in, the, milky, way, in, early, 1992, radio, astronomers, aleksander, wolszczan, and, dale, frail, announced, the, discovery, of, two, planets, orbiting, the, pulsar, psr, 1257, 12, this, discovery, was, confirmed, and, is, generally, considered, to, be, the, first, definitive, detection, of, exoplanets, researchers, suspect, they, formed, from, a, disk, remnant, left, over, from, the, supernova, that, produced, the, pulsar, the, first, confirmed, discovery, of, an, exoplanet, orbiting, an, ordinary, main, sequence, star, occurred, on, 6, october, 1995, when, michel, mayor, and, didier, queloz, of, the, university, of, geneva, announced, the, detection, of, 51, pegasi, b, an, exoplanet, around, 51, pegasi, from, then, until, the, kepler, space, telescope, mission, most, of, the, known, exoplanets, were, gas, giants, comparable, in, mass, to, jupiter, or, larger, as, they, were, more, easily, detected, the, catalog, of, kepler, candidate, planets, consists, mostly, of, planets, the, size, of, neptune, and, smaller, down, to, smaller, than, mercury, in, 2011, the, kepler, space, telescope, team, reported, the, discovery, of, the, first, earth, sized, exoplanets, orbiting, a, sun, like, star, kepler, 20e, and, kepler, 20f, since, that, time, more, than, 100, planets, have, been, identified, that, are, approximately, the, same, size, as, earth, 20, of, which, orbit, in, the, habitable, zone, of, their, star, the, range, of, orbits, where, a, terrestrial, planet, could, sustain, liquid, water, on, its, surface, given, enough, atmospheric, pressure, one, in, five, sun, like, stars, is, thought, to, have, an, earth, sized, planet, in, its, habitable, zone, which, suggests, that, the, nearest, would, be, expected, to, be, within, 12, light, years, distance, from, earth, the, frequency, of, occurrence, of, such, terrestrial, planets, is, one, of, the, variables, in, the, drake, equation, which, estimates, the, number, of, intelligent, communicating, civilizations, that, exist, in, the, milky, way, there, are, types, of, planets, that, do, not, exist, in, the, solar, system, super, earths, and, mini, neptunes, which, have, masses, between, that, of, earth, and, neptune, objects, less, than, about, twice, the, mass, of, earth, are, expected, to, be, rocky, like, earth, beyond, that, they, become, a, mixture, of, volatiles, and, gas, like, neptune, the, planet, gliese, 581c, with, a, mass, 5, 5, 10, 4, times, the, mass, of, earth, attracted, attention, upon, its, discovery, for, potentially, being, in, the, habitable, zone, though, later, studies, concluded, that, it, is, actually, too, close, to, its, star, to, be, habitable, planets, more, massive, than, jupiter, are, also, known, extending, seamlessly, into, the, realm, of, brown, dwarfs, exoplanets, have, been, found, that, are, much, closer, to, their, parent, star, than, any, planet, in, the, solar, system, is, to, the, sun, mercury, the, closest, planet, to, the, sun, at, 0, 4, au, takes, 88, days, for, an, orbit, but, ultra, short, period, planets, can, orbit, in, less, than, a, day, the, kepler, 11, system, has, five, of, its, planets, in, shorter, orbits, than, mercury, s, all, of, them, much, more, massive, than, mercury, there, are, hot, jupiters, such, as, 51, pegasi, b, that, orbit, very, close, to, their, star, and, may, evaporate, to, become, chthonian, planets, which, are, the, leftover, cores, there, are, also, exoplanets, that, are, much, farther, from, their, star, neptune, is, 30, au, from, the, sun, and, takes, 165, years, to, orbit, but, there, are, exoplanets, that, are, thousands, of, au, from, their, star, and, take, more, than, a, million, years, to, orbit, e, g, coconuts, 2b, although, each, planet, has, unique, physical, characteristics, a, number, of, broad, commonalities, do, exist, among, them, some, of, these, characteristics, such, as, rings, or, natural, satellites, have, only, as, yet, been, observed, in, planets, in, the, solar, system, whereas, others, are, commonly, observed, in, exoplanets, in, the, solar, system, all, the, planets, orbit, the, sun, in, the, same, direction, as, the, sun, rotates, counter, clockwise, as, seen, from, above, the, sun, s, north, pole, at, least, one, exoplanet, wasp, 17b, has, been, found, to, orbit, in, the, opposite, direction, to, its, star, s, rotation, the, period, of, one, revolution, of, a, planet, s, orbit, is, known, as, its, sidereal, period, or, year, a, planet, s, year, depends, on, its, distance, from, its, star, the, farther, a, planet, is, from, its, star, the, longer, the, distance, it, must, travel, and, the, slower, its, speed, since, it, is, less, affected, by, its, star, s, gravity, no, planet, s, orbit, is, perfectly, circular, and, hence, the, distance, of, each, from, the, host, star, varies, over, the, course, of, its, year, the, closest, approach, to, its, star, is, called, its, periastron, or, perihelion, in, the, solar, system, whereas, its, farthest, separation, from, the, star, is, called, its, apastron, aphelion, as, a, planet, approaches, periastron, its, speed, increases, as, it, trades, gravitational, potential, energy, for, kinetic, energy, just, as, a, falling, object, on, earth, accelerates, as, it, falls, as, the, planet, nears, apastron, its, speed, decreases, just, as, an, object, thrown, upwards, on, earth, slows, down, as, it, reaches, the, apex, of, its, trajectory, each, planet, s, orbit, is, delineated, by, a, set, of, elements, planets, have, varying, degrees, of, axial, tilt, they, spin, at, an, angle, to, the, plane, of, their, stars, equators, this, causes, the, amount, of, light, received, by, each, hemisphere, to, vary, over, the, course, of, its, year, when, the, northern, hemisphere, points, away, from, its, star, the, southern, hemisphere, points, towards, it, and, vice, versa, each, planet, therefore, has, seasons, resulting, in, changes, to, the, climate, over, the, course, of, its, year, the, time, at, which, each, hemisphere, points, farthest, or, nearest, from, its, star, is, known, as, its, solstice, each, planet, has, two, in, the, course, of, its, orbit, when, one, hemisphere, has, its, summer, solstice, with, its, day, being, the, longest, the, other, has, its, winter, solstice, when, its, day, is, shortest, the, varying, amount, of, light, and, heat, received, by, each, hemisphere, creates, annual, changes, in, weather, patterns, for, each, half, of, the, planet, jupiter, s, axial, tilt, is, very, small, so, its, seasonal, variation, is, minimal, uranus, on, the, other, hand, has, an, axial, tilt, so, extreme, it, is, virtually, on, its, side, which, means, that, its, hemispheres, are, either, continually, in, sunlight, or, continually, in, darkness, around, the, time, of, its, solstices, in, the, solar, system, mercury, venus, ceres, and, jupiter, have, very, small, tilts, pallas, uranus, and, pluto, have, extreme, ones, and, earth, mars, vesta, saturn, and, neptune, have, moderate, ones, among, exoplanets, axial, tilts, are, not, known, for, certain, though, most, hot, jupiters, are, believed, to, have, a, negligible, axial, tilt, as, a, result, of, their, proximity, to, their, stars, similarly, the, axial, tilts, of, the, planetary, mass, moons, are, near, zero, with, earth, s, moon, at, 6, 687, as, the, biggest, exception, additionally, callisto, s, axial, tilt, varies, between, 0, and, about, 2, degrees, on, timescales, of, thousands, of, years, the, planets, rotate, around, invisible, axes, through, their, centres, a, planet, s, rotation, period, is, known, as, a, stellar, day, most, of, the, planets, in, the, solar, system, rotate, in, the, same, direction, as, they, orbit, the, sun, which, is, counter, clockwise, as, seen, from, above, the, sun, s, north, pole, the, exceptions, are, venus, and, uranus, which, rotate, clockwise, though, uranus, s, extreme, axial, tilt, means, there, are, differing, conventions, on, which, of, its, poles, is, north, and, therefore, whether, it, is, rotating, clockwise, or, anti, clockwise, regardless, of, which, convention, is, used, uranus, has, a, retrograde, rotation, relative, to, its, orbit, the, rotation, of, a, planet, can, be, induced, by, several, factors, during, formation, a, net, angular, momentum, can, be, induced, by, the, individual, angular, momentum, contributions, of, accreted, objects, the, accretion, of, gas, by, the, giant, planets, contributes, to, the, angular, momentum, finally, during, the, last, stages, of, planet, building, a, stochastic, process, of, protoplanetary, accretion, can, randomly, alter, the, spin, axis, of, the, planet, there, is, great, variation, in, the, length, of, day, between, the, planets, with, venus, taking, 243, days, to, rotate, and, the, giant, planets, only, a, few, hours, the, rotational, periods, of, exoplanets, are, not, known, but, for, hot, jupiters, their, proximity, to, their, stars, means, that, they, are, tidally, locked, that, is, their, orbits, are, in, sync, with, their, rotations, this, means, they, always, show, one, face, to, their, stars, with, one, side, in, perpetual, day, the, other, in, perpetual, night, mercury, and, venus, the, closest, planets, to, the, sun, similarly, exhibit, very, slow, rotation, mercury, is, tidally, locked, into, a, 3, 2, spin, orbit, resonance, rotating, three, times, for, every, two, revolutions, around, the, sun, and, venus, s, rotation, may, be, in, equilibrium, between, tidal, forces, slowing, it, down, and, atmospheric, tides, created, by, solar, heating, speeding, it, up, all, the, large, moons, are, tidally, locked, to, their, parent, planets, pluto, and, charon, are, tidally, locked, to, each, other, as, are, eris, and, dysnomia, and, probably, orcus, and, its, moon, vanth, the, other, dwarf, planets, with, known, rotation, periods, rotate, faster, than, earth, haumea, rotates, so, fast, that, it, has, been, distorted, into, a, triaxial, ellipsoid, the, exoplanet, tau, bo, tis, b, and, its, parent, star, tau, bo, tis, appear, to, be, mutually, tidally, locked, the, defining, dynamic, characteristic, of, a, planet, according, to, the, iau, definition, is, that, it, has, cleared, its, neighborhood, a, planet, that, has, cleared, its, neighborhood, has, accumulated, enough, mass, to, gather, up, or, sweep, away, all, the, planetesimals, in, its, orbit, in, effect, it, orbits, its, star, in, isolation, as, opposed, to, sharing, its, orbit, with, a, multitude, of, similar, sized, objects, as, described, above, this, characteristic, was, mandated, as, part, of, the, iau, s, official, definition, of, a, planet, in, august, 2006, although, to, date, this, criterion, only, applies, to, the, solar, system, a, number, of, young, extrasolar, systems, have, been, found, in, which, evidence, suggests, orbital, clearing, is, taking, place, within, their, circumstellar, discs, gravity, causes, planets, to, be, pulled, into, a, roughly, spherical, shape, so, a, planet, s, size, can, be, expressed, roughly, by, an, average, radius, for, example, earth, radius, or, jupiter, radius, however, planets, are, not, perfectly, spherical, for, example, the, earth, s, rotation, causes, it, to, be, slightly, flattened, at, the, poles, with, a, bulge, around, the, equator, therefore, a, better, approximation, of, earth, s, shape, is, an, oblate, spheroid, whose, equatorial, diameter, is, 43, kilometers, 27, mi, larger, than, the, pole, to, pole, diameter, generally, a, planet, s, shape, may, be, described, by, giving, polar, and, equatorial, radii, of, a, spheroid, or, specifying, a, reference, ellipsoid, from, such, a, specification, the, planet, s, flattening, surface, area, and, volume, can, be, calculated, its, normal, gravity, can, be, computed, knowing, its, size, shape, rotation, rate, and, mass, a, planet, s, defining, physical, characteristic, is, that, it, is, massive, enough, for, the, force, of, its, own, gravity, to, dominate, over, the, electromagnetic, forces, binding, its, physical, structure, leading, to, a, state, of, hydrostatic, equilibrium, this, effectively, means, that, all, planets, are, spherical, or, spheroidal, up, to, a, certain, mass, an, object, can, be, irregular, in, shape, but, beyond, that, point, which, varies, depending, on, the, chemical, makeup, of, the, object, gravity, begins, to, pull, an, object, towards, its, own, centre, of, mass, until, the, object, collapses, into, a, sphere, mass, is, the, prime, attribute, by, which, planets, are, distinguished, from, stars, no, objects, between, the, masses, of, the, sun, and, jupiter, exist, in, the, solar, system, but, there, are, exoplanets, of, this, size, the, lower, stellar, mass, limit, is, estimated, to, be, around, 75, to, 80, times, that, of, jupiter, m, j, some, authors, advocate, that, this, be, used, as, the, upper, limit, for, planethood, on, the, grounds, that, the, internal, physics, of, objects, does, not, change, between, approximately, one, saturn, mass, beginning, of, significant, self, compression, and, the, onset, of, hydrogen, burning, and, becoming, a, red, dwarf, star, beyond, roughly, 13, m, j, at, least, for, objects, with, solar, type, isotopic, abundance, an, object, achieves, conditions, suitable, for, nuclear, fusion, of, deuterium, this, has, sometimes, been, advocated, as, a, boundary, even, though, deuterium, burning, does, not, last, very, long, and, most, brown, dwarfs, have, long, since, finished, burning, their, deuterium, this, is, not, universally, agreed, upon, the, exoplanets, encyclopaedia, includes, objects, up, to, 60, m, j, and, the, exoplanet, data, explorer, up, to, 24, m, j, the, smallest, known, exoplanet, with, an, accurately, known, mass, is, psr, b1257, 12a, one, of, the, first, exoplanets, discovered, which, was, found, in, 1992, in, orbit, around, a, pulsar, its, mass, is, roughly, half, that, of, the, planet, mercury, even, smaller, is, wd, 1145, 017, b, orbiting, a, white, dwarf, its, mass, is, roughly, that, of, the, dwarf, planet, haumea, and, it, is, typically, termed, a, minor, planet, the, smallest, known, planet, orbiting, a, main, sequence, star, other, than, the, sun, is, kepler, 37b, with, a, mass, and, radius, that, is, probably, slightly, higher, than, that, of, the, moon, the, smallest, object, in, the, solar, system, generally, agreed, to, be, a, geophysical, planet, is, saturn, s, moon, mimas, with, a, radius, about, 3, 1, of, earth, s, and, a, mass, about, 0, 00063, of, earth, s, saturn, s, smaller, moon, phoebe, currently, an, irregular, body, of, 1, 7, earth, s, radius, and, 0, 00014, earth, s, mass, is, thought, to, have, attained, hydrostatic, equilibrium, and, differentiation, early, in, its, history, before, being, battered, out, of, shape, by, impacts, some, asteroids, may, be, fragments, of, protoplanets, that, began, to, accrete, and, differentiate, but, suffered, catastrophic, collisions, leaving, only, a, metallic, or, rocky, core, today, or, a, reaccumulation, of, the, resulting, debris, every, planet, began, its, existence, in, an, entirely, fluid, state, in, early, formation, the, denser, heavier, materials, sank, to, the, centre, leaving, the, lighter, materials, near, the, surface, each, therefore, has, a, differentiated, interior, consisting, of, a, dense, planetary, core, surrounded, by, a, mantle, that, either, is, or, was, a, fluid, the, terrestrial, planets, mantles, are, sealed, within, hard, crusts, but, in, the, giant, planets, the, mantle, simply, blends, into, the, upper, cloud, layers, the, terrestrial, planets, have, cores, of, elements, such, as, iron, and, nickel, and, mantles, of, silicates, jupiter, and, saturn, are, believed, to, have, cores, of, rock, and, metal, surrounded, by, mantles, of, metallic, hydrogen, uranus, and, neptune, which, are, smaller, have, rocky, cores, surrounded, by, mantles, of, water, ammonia, methane, and, other, ices, the, fluid, action, within, these, planets, cores, creates, a, geodynamo, that, generates, a, magnetic, field, similar, differentiation, processes, are, believed, to, have, occurred, on, some, of, the, large, moons, and, dwarf, planets, though, the, process, may, not, always, have, been, completed, ceres, callisto, and, titan, appear, to, be, incompletely, differentiated, the, asteroid, vesta, though, not, a, dwarf, planet, because, it, was, battered, by, impacts, out, of, roundness, has, a, differentiated, interior, similar, to, that, of, venus, earth, and, mars, all, of, the, solar, system, planets, except, mercury, have, substantial, atmospheres, because, their, gravity, is, strong, enough, to, keep, gases, close, to, the, surface, saturn, s, largest, moon, titan, also, has, a, substantial, atmosphere, thicker, than, that, of, earth, neptune, s, largest, moon, triton, and, the, dwarf, planet, pluto, have, more, tenuous, atmospheres, the, larger, giant, planets, are, massive, enough, to, keep, large, amounts, of, the, light, gases, hydrogen, and, helium, whereas, the, smaller, planets, lose, these, gases, into, space, analysis, of, exoplanets, suggests, that, the, threshold, for, being, able, to, hold, on, to, these, light, gases, occurs, at, about, 2, 0, 0, 7, 0, 6, m, e, so, that, earth, and, venus, are, near, the, maximum, size, for, rocky, planets, the, composition, of, earth, s, atmosphere, is, different, from, the, other, planets, because, the, various, life, processes, that, have, transpired, on, the, planet, have, introduced, free, molecular, oxygen, the, atmospheres, of, mars, and, venus, are, both, dominated, by, carbon, dioxide, but, differ, drastically, in, density, the, average, surface, pressure, of, mars, s, atmosphere, is, less, than, 1, that, of, earth, s, too, low, to, allow, liquid, water, to, exist, while, the, average, surface, pressure, of, venus, s, atmosphere, is, about, 92, times, that, of, earth, s, it, is, likely, that, venus, s, atmosphere, was, the, result, of, a, runaway, greenhouse, effect, in, its, history, which, today, makes, it, the, hottest, planet, by, surface, temperature, hotter, even, than, mercury, despite, hostile, surface, conditions, temperature, and, pressure, at, about, 50, 55, km, altitude, in, venus, s, atmosphere, are, close, to, earthlike, conditions, the, only, place, in, the, solar, system, beyond, earth, where, this, is, so, and, this, region, has, been, suggested, as, a, plausible, base, for, future, human, exploration, titan, has, the, only, nitrogen, rich, planetary, atmosphere, in, the, solar, system, other, than, earth, s, just, as, earth, s, conditions, are, close, to, the, triple, point, of, water, allowing, it, to, exist, in, all, three, states, on, the, planet, s, surface, so, titan, s, are, to, the, triple, point, of, methane, planetary, atmospheres, are, affected, by, the, varying, insolation, or, internal, energy, leading, to, the, formation, of, dynamic, weather, systems, such, as, hurricanes, on, earth, planet, wide, dust, storms, on, mars, a, greater, than, earth, sized, anticyclone, on, jupiter, called, the, great, red, spot, and, holes, in, the, atmosphere, on, neptune, weather, patterns, detected, on, exoplanets, include, a, hot, region, on, hd, 189733, b, twice, the, size, of, the, great, red, spot, as, well, as, clouds, on, the, hot, jupiter, kepler, 7b, the, super, earth, gliese, 1214, b, and, others, hot, jupiters, due, to, their, extreme, proximities, to, their, host, stars, have, been, shown, to, be, losing, their, atmospheres, into, space, due, to, stellar, radiation, much, like, the, tails, of, comets, these, planets, may, have, vast, differences, in, temperature, between, their, day, and, night, sides, that, produce, supersonic, winds, although, multiple, factors, are, involved, and, the, details, of, the, atmospheric, dynamics, that, affect, the, day, night, temperature, difference, are, complex, one, important, characteristic, of, the, planets, is, their, intrinsic, magnetic, moments, which, in, turn, give, rise, to, magnetospheres, the, presence, of, a, magnetic, field, indicates, that, the, planet, is, still, geologically, alive, in, other, words, magnetized, planets, have, flows, of, electrically, conducting, material, in, their, interiors, which, generate, their, magnetic, fields, these, fields, significantly, change, the, interaction, of, the, planet, and, solar, wind, a, magnetized, planet, creates, a, cavity, in, the, solar, wind, around, itself, called, the, magnetosphere, which, the, wind, cannot, penetrate, the, magnetosphere, can, be, much, larger, than, the, planet, itself, in, contrast, non, magnetized, planets, have, only, small, magnetospheres, induced, by, interaction, of, the, ionosphere, with, the, solar, wind, which, cannot, effectively, protect, the, planet, of, the, eight, planets, in, the, solar, system, only, venus, and, mars, lack, such, a, magnetic, field, of, the, magnetized, planets, the, magnetic, field, of, mercury, is, the, weakest, and, is, barely, able, to, deflect, the, solar, wind, jupiter, s, moon, ganymede, has, a, magnetic, field, several, times, stronger, and, jupiter, s, is, the, strongest, in, the, solar, system, so, intense, in, fact, that, it, poses, a, serious, health, risk, to, future, crewed, missions, to, all, its, moons, inward, of, callisto, the, magnetic, fields, of, the, other, giant, planets, measured, at, their, surfaces, are, roughly, similar, in, strength, to, that, of, earth, but, their, magnetic, moments, are, significantly, larger, the, magnetic, fields, of, uranus, and, neptune, are, strongly, tilted, relative, to, the, planets, rotational, axes, and, displaced, from, the, planets, centres, in, 2003, a, team, of, astronomers, in, hawaii, observing, the, star, hd, 179949, detected, a, bright, spot, on, its, surface, apparently, created, by, the, magnetosphere, of, an, orbiting, hot, jupiter, several, planets, or, dwarf, planets, in, the, solar, system, such, as, neptune, and, pluto, have, orbital, periods, that, are, in, resonance, with, each, other, or, with, smaller, bodies, this, is, common, in, satellite, systems, e, g, the, resonance, between, io, europa, and, ganymede, around, jupiter, or, between, enceladus, and, dione, around, saturn, all, except, mercury, and, venus, have, natural, satellites, often, called, moons, earth, has, one, mars, has, two, and, the, giant, planets, have, numerous, moons, in, complex, planetary, type, systems, except, for, ceres, and, sedna, all, the, consensus, dwarf, planets, are, known, to, have, at, least, one, moon, as, well, many, moons, of, the, giant, planets, have, features, similar, to, those, on, the, terrestrial, planets, and, dwarf, planets, and, some, have, been, studied, as, possible, abodes, of, life, especially, europa, and, enceladus, the, four, giant, planets, are, orbited, by, planetary, rings, of, varying, size, and, complexity, the, rings, are, composed, primarily, of, dust, or, particulate, matter, but, can, host, tiny, moonlets, whose, gravity, shapes, and, maintains, their, structure, although, the, origins, of, planetary, rings, are, not, precisely, known, they, are, believed, to, be, the, result, of, natural, satellites, that, fell, below, their, parent, planets, roche, limits, and, were, torn, apart, by, tidal, forces, the, dwarf, planets, haumea, and, quaoar, also, have, rings, no, secondary, characteristics, have, been, observed, around, exoplanets, the, sub, brown, dwarf, cha, 110913, 773444, which, has, been, described, as, a, rogue, planet, is, believed, to, be, orbited, by, a, tiny, protoplanetary, disc, and, the, sub, brown, dwarf, ots, 44, was, shown, to, be, surrounded, by, a, substantial, protoplanetary, disk, of, at, least, 10, earth, masses, the, idea, of, planets, has, evolved, over, the, history, of, astronomy, from, the, divine, lights, of, antiquity, to, the, earthly, objects, of, the, scientific, age, the, concept, has, expanded, to, include, worlds, not, only, in, the, solar, system, but, in, multitudes, of, other, extrasolar, systems, the, consensus, as, to, what, counts, as, a, planet, as, opposed, to, other, objects, has, changed, several, times, it, previously, encompassed, asteroids, moons, and, dwarf, planets, like, pluto, and, there, continues, to, be, some, disagreement, today, the, five, classical, planets, of, the, solar, system, being, visible, to, the, naked, eye, have, been, known, since, ancient, times, and, have, had, a, significant, impact, on, mythology, religious, cosmology, and, ancient, astronomy, in, ancient, times, astronomers, noted, how, certain, lights, moved, across, the, sky, as, opposed, to, the, fixed, stars, which, maintained, a, constant, relative, position, in, the, sky, ancient, greeks, called, these, lights, plan, tes, asteres, wandering, stars, or, simply, plan, tai, wanderers, from, which, today, s, word, planet, was, derived, in, ancient, greece, china, babylon, and, indeed, all, pre, modern, civilizations, it, was, almost, universally, believed, that, earth, was, the, center, of, the, universe, and, that, all, the, planets, circled, earth, the, reasons, for, this, perception, were, that, stars, and, planets, appeared, to, revolve, around, earth, each, day, and, the, apparently, common, sense, perceptions, that, earth, was, solid, and, stable, and, that, it, was, not, moving, but, at, rest, the, first, civilization, known, to, have, a, functional, theory, of, the, planets, were, the, babylonians, who, lived, in, mesopotamia, in, the, first, and, second, millennia, bc, the, oldest, surviving, planetary, astronomical, text, is, the, babylonian, venus, tablet, of, ammisaduqa, a, 7th, century, bc, copy, of, a, list, of, observations, of, the, motions, of, the, planet, venus, that, probably, dates, as, early, as, the, second, millennium, bc, the, mul, apin, is, a, pair, of, cuneiform, tablets, dating, from, the, 7th, century, bc, that, lays, out, the, motions, of, the, sun, moon, and, planets, over, the, course, of, the, year, late, babylonian, astronomy, is, the, origin, of, western, astronomy, and, indeed, all, western, efforts, in, the, exact, sciences, the, enuma, anu, enlil, written, during, the, neo, assyrian, period, in, the, 7th, century, bc, comprises, a, list, of, omens, and, their, relationships, with, various, celestial, phenomena, including, the, motions, of, the, planets, the, inferior, planets, venus, and, mercury, and, the, superior, planets, mars, jupiter, and, saturn, were, all, identified, by, babylonian, astronomers, these, would, remain, the, only, known, planets, until, the, invention, of, the, telescope, in, early, modern, times, the, ancient, greeks, initially, did, not, attach, as, much, significance, to, the, planets, as, the, babylonians, in, the, 6th, and, 5th, centuries, bc, the, pythagoreans, appear, to, have, developed, their, own, independent, planetary, theory, which, consisted, of, the, earth, sun, moon, and, planets, revolving, around, a, central, fire, at, the, center, of, the, universe, pythagoras, or, parmenides, is, said, to, have, been, the, first, to, identify, the, evening, star, hesperos, and, morning, star, phosphoros, as, one, and, the, same, aphrodite, greek, corresponding, to, latin, venus, though, this, had, long, been, known, in, mesopotamia, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, aristarchus, of, samos, proposed, a, heliocentric, system, according, to, which, earth, and, the, planets, revolved, around, the, sun, the, geocentric, system, remained, dominant, until, the, scientific, revolution, by, the, 1st, century, bc, during, the, hellenistic, period, the, greeks, had, begun, to, develop, their, own, mathematical, schemes, for, predicting, the, positions, of, the, planets, these, schemes, which, were, based, on, geometry, rather, than, the, arithmetic, of, the, babylonians, would, eventually, eclipse, the, babylonians, theories, in, complexity, and, comprehensiveness, and, account, for, most, of, the, astronomical, movements, observed, from, earth, with, the, naked, eye, these, theories, would, reach, their, fullest, expression, in, the, almagest, written, by, ptolemy, in, the, 2nd, century, ce, so, complete, was, the, domination, of, ptolemy, s, model, that, it, superseded, all, previous, works, on, astronomy, and, remained, the, definitive, astronomical, text, in, the, western, world, for, 13, centuries, to, the, greeks, and, romans, there, were, seven, known, planets, each, presumed, to, be, circling, earth, according, to, the, complex, laws, laid, out, by, ptolemy, they, were, in, increasing, order, from, earth, in, ptolemy, s, order, and, using, modern, names, the, moon, mercury, venus, the, sun, mars, jupiter, and, saturn, after, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, astronomy, developed, further, in, india, and, the, medieval, islamic, world, in, 499, ce, the, indian, astronomer, aryabhata, propounded, a, planetary, model, that, explicitly, incorporated, earth, s, rotation, about, its, axis, which, he, explains, as, the, cause, of, what, appears, to, be, an, apparent, westward, motion, of, the, stars, he, also, theorized, that, the, orbits, of, planets, were, elliptical, aryabhata, s, followers, were, particularly, strong, in, south, india, where, his, principles, of, the, diurnal, rotation, of, earth, among, others, were, followed, and, a, number, of, secondary, works, were, based, on, them, the, astronomy, of, the, islamic, golden, age, mostly, took, place, in, the, middle, east, central, asia, al, andalus, and, north, africa, and, later, in, the, far, east, and, india, these, astronomers, like, the, polymath, ibn, al, haytham, generally, accepted, geocentrism, although, they, did, dispute, ptolemy, s, system, of, epicycles, and, sought, alternatives, the, 10th, century, astronomer, abu, sa, id, al, sijzi, accepted, that, the, earth, rotates, around, its, axis, in, the, 11th, century, the, transit, of, venus, was, observed, by, avicenna, his, contemporary, al, biruni, devised, a, method, of, determining, the, earth, s, radius, using, trigonometry, that, unlike, the, older, method, of, eratosthenes, only, required, observations, at, a, single, mountain, with, the, advent, of, the, scientific, revolution, and, the, heliocentric, model, of, copernicus, galileo, and, kepler, use, of, the, term, planet, changed, from, something, that, moved, around, the, sky, relative, to, the, fixed, star, to, a, body, that, orbited, the, sun, directly, a, primary, planet, or, indirectly, a, secondary, or, satellite, planet, thus, the, earth, was, added, to, the, roster, of, planets, and, the, sun, was, removed, the, copernican, count, of, primary, planets, stood, until, 1781, when, william, herschel, discovered, uranus, when, four, satellites, of, jupiter, the, galilean, moons, and, five, of, saturn, were, discovered, in, the, 17th, century, they, joined, earth, s, moon, in, the, category, of, satellite, planets, or, secondary, planets, orbiting, the, primary, planets, though, in, the, following, decades, they, would, come, to, be, called, simply, satellites, for, short, scientists, generally, considered, planetary, satellites, to, also, be, planets, until, about, the, 1920s, although, this, usage, was, not, common, among, non, scientists, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 19th, century, four, new, planets, were, discovered, ceres, in, 1801, pallas, in, 1802, juno, in, 1804, and, vesta, in, 1807, it, soon, became, apparent, that, they, were, rather, different, from, previously, known, planets, they, shared, the, same, general, region, of, space, between, mars, and, jupiter, the, asteroid, belt, with, sometimes, overlapping, orbits, this, was, an, area, where, only, one, planet, had, been, expected, and, they, were, much, smaller, than, all, other, planets, indeed, it, was, suspected, that, they, might, be, shards, of, a, larger, planet, that, had, broken, up, herschel, called, them, asteroids, from, the, greek, for, starlike, because, even, in, the, largest, telescopes, they, resembled, stars, without, a, resolvable, disk, the, situation, was, stable, for, four, decades, but, in, the, 1840s, several, additional, asteroids, were, discovered, astraea, in, 1845, hebe, iris, and, flora, in, 1847, metis, in, 1848, and, hygiea, in, 1849, new, planets, were, discovered, every, year, as, a, result, astronomers, began, tabulating, the, asteroids, minor, planets, separately, from, the, major, planets, and, assigning, them, numbers, instead, of, abstract, planetary, symbols, although, they, continued, to, be, considered, as, small, planets, neptune, was, discovered, in, 1846, its, position, having, been, predicted, thanks, to, its, gravitational, influence, upon, uranus, because, the, orbit, of, mercury, appeared, to, be, affected, in, a, similar, way, it, was, believed, in, the, late, 19th, century, that, there, might, be, another, planet, even, closer, to, the, sun, however, the, discrepancy, between, mercury, s, orbit, and, the, predictions, of, newtonian, gravity, was, instead, explained, by, an, improved, theory, of, gravity, einstein, s, general, relativity, pluto, was, discovered, in, 1930, after, initial, observations, led, to, the, belief, that, it, was, larger, than, earth, the, object, was, immediately, accepted, as, the, ninth, major, planet, further, monitoring, found, the, body, was, actually, much, smaller, in, 1936, ray, lyttleton, suggested, that, pluto, may, be, an, escaped, satellite, of, neptune, and, fred, whipple, suggested, in, 1964, that, pluto, may, be, a, comet, the, discovery, of, its, large, moon, charon, in, 1978, showed, that, pluto, was, only, 0, 2, the, mass, of, earth, as, this, was, still, substantially, more, massive, than, any, known, asteroid, and, because, no, other, trans, neptunian, objects, had, been, discovered, at, that, time, pluto, kept, its, planetary, status, only, officially, losing, it, in, 2006, in, the, 1950s, gerard, kuiper, published, papers, on, the, origin, of, the, asteroids, he, recognized, that, asteroids, were, typically, not, spherical, as, had, previously, been, thought, and, that, the, asteroid, families, were, remnants, of, collisions, thus, he, differentiated, between, the, largest, asteroids, as, true, planets, versus, the, smaller, ones, as, collisional, fragments, from, the, 1960s, onwards, the, term, minor, planet, was, mostly, displaced, by, the, term, asteroid, and, references, to, the, asteroids, as, planets, in, the, literature, became, scarce, except, for, the, geologically, evolved, largest, three, ceres, and, less, often, pallas, and, vesta, the, beginning, of, solar, system, exploration, by, space, probes, in, the, 1960s, spurred, a, renewed, interest, in, planetary, science, a, split, in, definitions, regarding, satellites, occurred, around, then, planetary, scientists, began, to, reconsider, the, large, moons, as, also, being, planets, but, astronomers, who, were, not, planetary, scientists, generally, did, not, this, is, not, exactly, the, same, as, the, definition, used, in, the, previous, century, which, classed, all, satellites, as, secondary, planets, even, non, round, ones, like, saturn, s, hyperion, or, mars, s, phobos, and, deimos, all, the, eight, major, planets, and, their, planetary, mass, moons, have, since, been, explored, by, spacecraft, as, have, many, asteroids, and, the, dwarf, planets, ceres, and, pluto, however, so, far, the, only, planetary, mass, body, beyond, earth, that, has, been, explored, by, humans, is, the, moon, a, growing, number, of, astronomers, argued, for, pluto, to, be, declassified, as, a, planet, because, many, similar, objects, approaching, its, size, had, been, found, in, the, same, region, of, the, solar, system, the, kuiper, belt, during, the, 1990s, and, early, 2000s, pluto, was, found, to, be, just, one, small, body, in, a, population, of, thousands, they, often, referred, to, the, demotion, of, the, asteroids, as, a, precedent, although, that, had, been, done, based, on, their, geophysical, differences, from, planets, rather, than, their, being, in, a, belt, some, of, the, larger, trans, neptunian, objects, such, as, quaoar, sedna, eris, and, haumea, were, heralded, in, the, popular, press, as, the, tenth, planet, the, announcement, of, eris, in, 2005, an, object, 27, more, massive, than, pluto, created, the, impetus, for, an, official, definition, of, a, planet, as, considering, pluto, a, planet, would, logically, have, demanded, that, eris, be, considered, a, planet, as, well, since, different, procedures, were, in, place, for, naming, planets, versus, non, planets, this, created, an, urgent, situation, because, under, the, rules, eris, could, not, be, named, without, defining, what, a, planet, was, at, the, time, it, was, also, thought, that, the, size, required, for, a, trans, neptunian, object, to, become, round, was, about, the, same, as, that, required, for, the, moons, of, the, giant, planets, about, 400, km, diameter, a, figure, that, would, have, suggested, about, 200, round, objects, in, the, kuiper, belt, and, thousands, more, beyond, many, astronomers, argued, that, the, public, would, not, accept, a, definition, creating, a, large, number, of, planets, source, iau, 2006, general, assembly, resolutions, 5, and, 6, pdf, iau, 24, august, 2006, retrieved, 23, june, 2009, to, acknowledge, the, problem, the, international, astronomical, union, iau, set, about, creating, the, definition, of, planet, and, produced, one, in, august, 2006, under, this, definition, the, solar, system, is, considered, to, have, eight, planets, mercury, venus, earth, mars, jupiter, saturn, uranus, and, neptune, bodies, that, fulfill, the, first, two, conditions, but, not, the, third, are, classified, as, dwarf, planets, provided, they, are, not, natural, satellites, of, other, planets, originally, an, iau, committee, had, proposed, a, definition, that, would, have, included, a, larger, number, of, planets, as, it, did, not, include, c, as, a, criterion, after, much, discussion, it, was, decided, via, a, vote, that, those, bodies, should, instead, be, classified, as, dwarf, planets, the, iau, definition, has, not, been, universally, used, or, accepted, in, planetary, geology, celestial, objects, are, defined, as, planets, by, geophysical, characteristics, a, celestial, body, may, acquire, a, dynamic, planetary, geology, at, approximately, the, mass, required, for, its, mantle, to, become, plastic, under, its, own, weight, this, leads, to, a, state, of, hydrostatic, equilibrium, where, the, body, acquires, a, stable, round, shape, which, is, adopted, as, the, hallmark, of, planethood, by, geophysical, definitions, for, example, a, substellar, mass, body, that, has, never, undergone, nuclear, fusion, and, has, enough, gravitation, to, be, round, due, to, hydrostatic, equilibrium, regardless, of, its, orbital, parameters, in, the, solar, system, this, mass, is, generally, less, than, the, mass, required, for, a, body, to, clear, its, orbit, thus, some, objects, that, are, considered, planets, under, geophysical, definitions, are, not, considered, as, such, under, the, iau, definition, such, as, ceres, and, pluto, in, practice, the, requirement, for, hydrostatic, equilibrium, is, universally, relaxed, to, a, requirement, for, rounding, and, compaction, under, self, gravity, mercury, is, not, actually, in, hydrostatic, equilibrium, but, is, universally, included, as, a, planet, regardless, proponents, of, such, definitions, often, argue, that, location, should, not, matter, and, that, planethood, should, be, defined, by, the, intrinsic, properties, of, an, object, dwarf, planets, had, been, proposed, as, a, category, of, small, planet, as, opposed, to, planetoids, as, sub, planetary, objects, and, planetary, geologists, continue, to, treat, them, as, planets, despite, the, iau, definition, the, number, of, dwarf, planets, even, among, known, objects, is, not, certain, in, 2019, grundy, et, al, argued, based, on, the, low, densities, of, some, mid, sized, trans, neptunian, objects, that, the, limiting, size, required, for, a, trans, neptunian, object, to, reach, equilibrium, was, in, fact, much, larger, than, it, is, for, the, icy, moons, of, the, giant, planets, being, about, 900, 1000, km, diameter, there, is, general, consensus, on, ceres, in, the, asteroid, belt, and, on, the, eight, trans, neptunians, that, probably, cross, this, threshold, orcus, pluto, haumea, quaoar, makemake, gonggong, eris, and, sedna, planetary, geologists, may, include, the, nineteen, known, planetary, mass, moons, as, satellite, planets, including, earth, s, moon, and, pluto, s, charon, like, the, early, modern, astronomers, some, go, even, further, and, include, as, planets, relatively, large, geologically, evolved, bodies, that, are, nonetheless, not, very, round, today, such, as, pallas, and, vesta, rounded, bodies, that, were, completely, disrupted, by, impacts, and, re, accreted, like, hygiea, or, even, everything, at, least, the, diameter, of, saturn, s, moon, mimas, the, smallest, planetary, mass, moon, this, may, even, include, objects, that, are, not, round, but, happen, to, be, larger, than, mimas, like, neptune, s, moon, proteus, astronomer, jean, luc, margot, proposed, a, mathematical, criterion, that, determines, whether, an, object, can, clear, its, orbit, during, the, lifetime, of, its, host, star, based, on, the, mass, of, the, planet, its, semimajor, axis, and, the, mass, of, its, host, star, the, formula, produces, a, value, called, that, is, greater, than, 1, for, planets, the, eight, known, planets, and, all, known, exoplanets, have, values, above, 100, while, ceres, pluto, and, eris, have, values, of, 0, 1, or, less, objects, with, values, of, 1, or, more, are, expected, to, be, approximately, spherical, so, that, objects, that, fulfill, the, orbital, zone, clearance, requirement, around, sun, like, stars, will, also, fulfill, the, roundness, requirement, though, this, may, not, be, the, case, around, very, low, mass, stars, in, 2024, margot, and, collaborators, proposed, a, revised, version, of, the, criterion, with, a, uniform, clearing, timescale, of, 10, billion, years, the, approximate, main, sequence, lifetime, of, the, sun, or, 13, 8, billion, years, the, age, of, the, universe, to, accommodate, planets, orbiting, brown, dwarfs, even, before, the, discovery, of, exoplanets, there, were, particular, disagreements, over, whether, an, object, should, be, considered, a, planet, if, it, was, part, of, a, distinct, population, such, as, a, belt, or, if, it, was, large, enough, to, generate, energy, by, the, thermonuclear, fusion, of, deuterium, complicating, the, matter, even, further, bodies, too, small, to, generate, energy, by, fusing, deuterium, can, form, by, gas, cloud, collapse, just, like, stars, and, brown, dwarfs, even, down, to, the, mass, of, jupiter, there, was, thus, disagreement, about, whether, how, a, body, formed, should, be, taken, into, account, in, 1992, astronomers, aleksander, wolszczan, and, dale, frail, announced, the, discovery, of, planets, around, a, pulsar, psr, b1257, 12, this, discovery, is, generally, considered, to, be, the, first, definitive, detection, of, a, planetary, system, around, another, star, then, on, 6, october, 1995, michel, mayor, and, didier, queloz, of, the, geneva, observatory, announced, the, first, definitive, detection, of, an, exoplanet, orbiting, an, ordinary, main, sequence, star, 51, pegasi, the, discovery, of, exoplanets, led, to, another, ambiguity, in, defining, a, planet, the, point, at, which, a, planet, becomes, a, star, many, known, exoplanets, are, many, times, the, mass, of, jupiter, approaching, that, of, stellar, objects, known, as, brown, dwarfs, brown, dwarfs, are, generally, considered, stars, due, to, their, theoretical, ability, to, fuse, deuterium, a, heavier, isotope, of, hydrogen, although, objects, more, massive, than, 75, times, that, of, jupiter, fuse, simple, hydrogen, objects, of, 13, jupiter, masses, can, fuse, deuterium, deuterium, is, quite, rare, constituting, less, than, 0, 0026, of, the, hydrogen, in, the, galaxy, and, most, brown, dwarfs, would, have, ceased, fusing, deuterium, long, before, their, discovery, making, them, effectively, indistinguishable, from, supermassive, planets, the, 2006, iau, definition, presents, some, challenges, for, exoplanets, because, the, language, is, specific, to, the, solar, system, and, the, criteria, of, roundness, and, orbital, zone, clearance, are, not, presently, observable, for, exoplanets, in, 2018, this, definition, was, reassessed, and, updated, as, knowledge, of, exoplanets, increased, the, current, official, working, definition, of, an, exoplanet, is, as, follows, the, iau, noted, that, this, definition, could, be, expected, to, evolve, as, knowledge, improves, a, 2022, review, article, discussing, the, history, and, rationale, of, this, definition, suggested, that, the, words, in, young, star, clusters, should, be, deleted, in, clause, 3, as, such, objects, have, now, been, found, elsewhere, and, that, the, term, sub, brown, dwarfs, should, be, replaced, by, the, more, current, free, floating, planetary, mass, objects, the, term, planetary, mass, object, has, also, been, used, to, refer, to, ambiguous, situations, concerning, exoplanets, such, as, objects, with, mass, typical, for, a, planet, that, are, free, floating, or, orbit, a, brown, dwarf, instead, of, a, star, free, floating, objects, of, planetary, mass, have, sometimes, been, called, planets, anyway, specifically, rogue, planets, the, limit, of, 13, jupiter, masses, is, not, universally, accepted, objects, below, this, mass, limit, can, sometimes, burn, deuterium, and, the, amount, of, deuterium, that, is, burned, depends, on, an, object, s, composition, furthermore, deuterium, is, quite, scarce, so, the, stage, of, deuterium, burning, does, not, actually, last, very, long, unlike, hydrogen, burning, in, a, star, deuterium, burning, does, not, significantly, affect, the, future, evolution, of, an, object, the, relationship, between, mass, and, radius, or, density, show, no, special, feature, at, this, limit, according, to, which, brown, dwarfs, have, the, same, physics, and, internal, structure, as, lighter, jovian, planets, and, would, more, naturally, be, considered, planets, thus, many, catalogues, of, exoplanets, include, objects, heavier, than, 13, jupiter, masses, sometimes, going, up, to, 60, jupiter, masses, the, limit, for, hydrogen, burning, and, becoming, a, red, dwarf, star, is, about, 80, jupiter, masses, the, situation, of, main, sequence, stars, has, been, used, to, argue, for, such, an, inclusive, definition, of, planet, as, well, as, they, also, differ, greatly, along, the, two, orders, of, magnitude, that, they, cover, in, their, structure, atmospheres, temperature, spectral, features, and, probably, formation, mechanisms, yet, they, are, all, considered, as, one, class, being, all, hydrostatic, equilibrium, objects, undergoing, nuclear, burning, the, naming, of, planets, differs, between, planets, of, the, solar, system, and, exoplanets, planets, of, other, planetary, systems, exoplanets, are, commonly, named, after, their, parent, star, and, their, order, of, discovery, within, its, planetary, system, such, as, proxima, centauri, b, the, names, for, the, planets, of, the, solar, system, other, than, earth, in, the, english, language, are, derived, from, naming, practices, developed, consecutively, by, the, babylonians, greeks, and, romans, of, antiquity, the, practice, of, grafting, the, names, of, gods, onto, the, planets, was, almost, certainly, borrowed, from, the, babylonians, by, the, ancient, greeks, and, thereafter, from, the, greeks, by, the, romans, the, babylonians, named, venus, after, the, sumerian, goddess, of, love, with, the, akkadian, name, ishtar, mars, after, their, god, of, war, nergal, mercury, after, their, god, of, wisdom, nabu, and, jupiter, after, their, chief, god, marduk, there, are, too, many, concordances, between, greek, and, babylonian, naming, conventions, for, them, to, have, arisen, separately, given, the, differences, in, mythology, the, correspondence, was, not, perfect, for, instance, the, babylonian, nergal, was, a, god, of, war, and, thus, the, greeks, identified, him, with, ares, unlike, ares, nergal, was, also, a, god, of, pestilence, and, ruler, of, the, underworld, in, ancient, greece, the, two, great, luminaries, the, sun, and, the, moon, were, called, helios, and, selene, two, ancient, titanic, deities, the, slowest, planet, saturn, was, called, phainon, the, shiner, followed, by, phaethon, jupiter, bright, the, red, planet, mars, was, known, as, pyroeis, the, fiery, the, brightest, venus, was, known, as, phosphoros, the, light, bringer, and, the, fleeting, final, planet, mercury, was, called, stilbon, the, gleamer, the, greeks, assigned, each, planet, to, one, among, their, pantheon, of, gods, the, olympians, and, the, earlier, titans, although, modern, greeks, still, use, their, ancient, names, for, the, planets, other, european, languages, because, of, the, influence, of, the, roman, empire, and, later, the, catholic, church, use, the, roman, latin, names, rather, than, the, greek, ones, the, romans, inherited, proto, indo, european, mythology, as, the, greeks, did, and, shared, with, them, a, common, pantheon, under, different, names, but, the, romans, lacked, the, rich, narrative, traditions, that, greek, poetic, culture, had, given, their, gods, during, the, later, period, of, the, roman, republic, roman, writers, borrowed, much, of, the, greek, narratives, and, applied, them, to, their, own, pantheon, to, the, point, where, they, became, virtually, indistinguishable, when, the, romans, studied, greek, astronomy, they, gave, the, planets, their, own, gods, names, mercurius, for, hermes, venus, aphrodite, mars, ares, iuppiter, zeus, and, saturnus, cronus, some, romans, following, a, belief, possibly, originating, in, mesopotamia, but, developed, in, hellenistic, egypt, believed, that, the, seven, gods, after, whom, the, planets, were, named, took, hourly, shifts, in, looking, after, affairs, on, earth, the, order, of, shifts, went, saturn, jupiter, mars, sun, venus, mercury, moon, from, the, farthest, to, the, closest, planet, therefore, the, first, day, was, started, by, saturn, 1st, hour, second, day, by, sun, 25th, hour, followed, by, moon, 49th, hour, mars, mercury, jupiter, and, venus, because, each, day, was, named, by, the, god, that, started, it, this, became, the, order, of, the, days, of, the, week, in, the, roman, calendar, in, english, saturday, sunday, and, monday, are, straightforward, translations, of, these, roman, names, the, other, days, were, renamed, after, t, w, tuesday, w, den, wednesday, unor, thursday, and, fr, friday, the, anglo, saxon, gods, considered, similar, or, equivalent, to, mars, mercury, jupiter, and, venus, respectively, earth, s, name, in, english, is, not, derived, from, greco, roman, mythology, because, it, was, only, generally, accepted, as, a, planet, in, the, 17th, century, there, is, no, tradition, of, naming, it, after, a, god, the, same, is, true, in, english, at, least, of, the, sun, and, the, moon, though, they, are, no, longer, generally, considered, planets, the, name, originates, from, the, old, english, word, eor, e, which, was, the, word, for, ground, and, dirt, as, well, as, the, world, itself, as, with, its, equivalents, in, the, other, germanic, languages, it, derives, ultimately, from, the, proto, germanic, word, er, as, can, be, seen, in, the, english, earth, the, german, erde, the, dutch, aarde, and, the, scandinavian, jord, many, of, the, romance, languages, retain, the, old, roman, word, terra, or, some, variation, of, it, that, was, used, with, the, meaning, of, dry, land, as, opposed, to, sea, the, non, romance, languages, use, their, own, native, words, the, greeks, retain, their, original, name, ge, non, european, cultures, use, other, planetary, naming, systems, india, uses, a, system, based, on, the, navagraha, which, incorporates, the, seven, traditional, planets, and, the, ascending, and, descending, lunar, nodes, rahu, and, ketu, the, planets, are, surya, sun, chandra, moon, budha, for, mercury, shukra, bright, for, venus, mangala, the, god, of, war, for, mars, b, haspati, councilor, of, the, gods, for, jupiter, and, shani, symbolic, of, time, for, saturn, the, native, persian, names, of, most, of, the, planets, are, based, on, identifications, of, the, mesopotamian, gods, with, iranian, gods, analogous, to, the, greek, and, latin, names, mercury, is, tir, persian, for, the, western, iranian, god, t, riya, patron, of, scribes, analogous, to, nabu, venus, is, n, hid, for, anahita, mars, is, bahr, m, for, verethragna, and, jupiter, is, hormoz, for, ahura, mazda, the, persian, name, for, saturn, keyv, n, is, a, borrowing, from, akkadian, kajam, nu, meaning, the, permanent, steady, china, and, the, countries, of, eastern, asia, historically, subject, to, chinese, cultural, influence, such, as, japan, korea, and, vietnam, use, a, naming, system, based, on, the, five, chinese, elements, water, mercury, water, star, metal, venus, metal, star, fire, mars, fire, star, wood, jupiter, wood, star, and, earth, saturn, earth, star, the, names, of, uranus, sky, king, star, neptune, sea, king, star, and, pluto, underworld, king, star, in, chinese, korean, and, japanese, are, calques, based, on, the, roles, of, those, gods, in, roman, and, greek, mythology, in, the, 19th, century, alexander, wylie, and, li, shanlan, calqued, the, names, of, the, first, 117, asteroids, into, chinese, and, many, of, their, names, are, still, used, today, e, g, ceres, grain, goddess, star, pallas, wisdom, goddess, star, juno, marriage, goddess, star, vesta, hearth, goddess, star, and, hygiea, health, goddess, star, such, translations, were, extended, to, some, later, minor, planets, including, some, of, the, dwarf, planets, discovered, in, the, 21st, century, e, g, haumea, pregnancy, goddess, star, makemake, bird, goddess, star, and, eris, quarrel, goddess, star, however, except, for, the, better, known, asteroids, and, dwarf, planets, many, of, them, are, rare, outside, chinese, astronomical, dictionaries, in, traditional, hebrew, astronomy, the, seven, traditional, planets, have, for, the, most, part, descriptive, names, the, sun, is, ammah, or, the, hot, one, the, moon, is, levanah, or, the, white, one, venus, is, kokhav, nogah, or, the, bright, planet, mercury, is, kokhav, or, the, planet, given, its, lack, of, distinguishing, features, mars, is, ma, adim, or, the, red, one, and, saturn, is, shabbatai, or, the, resting, one, in, reference, to, its, slow, movement, compared, to, the, other, visible, planets, the, odd, one, out, is, jupiter, called, tzedeq, or, justice, these, names, first, attested, in, the, babylonian, talmud, are, not, the, original, hebrew, names, of, the, planets, in, 377, epiphanius, of, salamis, recorded, another, set, of, names, that, seem, to, have, pagan, or, canaanite, associations, those, names, since, replaced, for, religious, reasons, were, probably, the, historical, semitic, names, and, may, have, much, earlier, roots, going, back, to, babylonian, astronomy, hebrew, names, were, chosen, for, uranus, oron, small, light, and, neptune, rahab, a, biblical, sea, monster, in, 2009, prior, to, that, the, names, uranus, and, neptune, had, simply, been, borrowed, the, etymologies, for, the, arabic, names, of, the, planets, are, less, well, understood, mostly, agreed, among, scholars, are, venus, arabic, az, zuhara, the, bright, one, earth, al, ar, from, the, same, root, as, eretz, and, saturn, zu, al, withdrawer, multiple, suggested, etymologies, exist, for, mercury, u, rid, mars, al, mirr, kh, and, jupiter, al, mu, tar, but, there, is, no, agreement, among, scholars, when, subsequent, planets, were, discovered, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, uranus, was, named, for, a, greek, deity, and, neptune, for, a, roman, one, the, counterpart, of, poseidon, the, asteroids, were, initially, named, from, mythology, as, well, ceres, juno, and, vesta, are, major, roman, goddesses, and, pallas, is, an, epithet, of, the, major, greek, goddess, athena, but, as, more, and, more, were, discovered, they, first, started, being, named, after, more, minor, goddesses, and, the, mythological, restriction, was, dropped, starting, from, the, twentieth, asteroid, massalia, in, 1852, pluto, named, after, the, greek, god, of, the, underworld, was, given, a, classical, name, as, it, was, considered, a, major, planet, when, it, was, discovered, after, more, objects, were, discovered, beyond, neptune, naming, conventions, depending, on, their, orbits, were, put, in, place, those, in, the, 2, 3, resonance, with, neptune, the, plutinos, are, given, names, from, underworld, myths, while, others, are, given, names, from, creation, myths, most, of, the, trans, neptunian, planetoids, are, named, after, gods, and, goddesses, from, other, cultures, e, g, quaoar, is, named, after, a, tongva, god, there, are, a, few, exceptions, which, continue, the, roman, and, greek, scheme, notably, including, eris, as, it, had, initially, been, considered, a, tenth, planet, the, moons, including, the, planetary, mass, ones, are, generally, given, names, with, some, association, with, their, parent, planet, the, planetary, mass, moons, of, jupiter, are, named, after, four, of, zeus, lovers, or, other, sexual, partners, those, of, saturn, are, named, after, cronus, brothers, and, sisters, the, titans, those, of, uranus, are, named, after, characters, from, shakespeare, and, pope, originally, specifically, from, fairy, mythology, but, that, ended, with, the, naming, of, miranda, neptune, s, planetary, mass, moon, triton, is, named, after, the, god, s, son, pluto, s, planetary, mass, moon, charon, is, named, after, the, ferryman, of, the, dead, who, carries, the, souls, of, the, newly, deceased, to, the, underworld, pluto, s, domain, the, written, symbols, for, mercury, venus, jupiter, saturn, and, possibly, mars, have, been, traced, to, forms, found, in, late, greek, papyrus, texts, the, symbols, for, jupiter, and, saturn, are, identified, as, monograms, of, the, corresponding, greek, names, and, the, symbol, for, mercury, is, a, stylized, caduceus, according, to, annie, scott, dill, maunder, antecedents, of, the, planetary, symbols, were, used, in, art, to, represent, the, gods, associated, with, the, classical, planets, bianchini, s, planisphere, discovered, by, francesco, bianchini, in, the, 18th, century, but, produced, in, the, 2nd, century, shows, greek, personifications, of, planetary, gods, charged, with, early, versions, of, the, planetary, symbols, mercury, has, a, caduceus, venus, has, attached, to, her, necklace, a, cord, connected, to, another, necklace, mars, a, spear, jupiter, a, staff, saturn, a, scythe, the, sun, a, circlet, with, rays, radiating, from, it, and, the, moon, a, headdress, with, a, crescent, attached, the, modern, shapes, with, the, cross, marks, first, appeared, around, the, 16th, century, according, to, maunder, the, addition, of, crosses, appears, to, be, an, attempt, to, give, a, savour, of, christianity, to, the, symbols, of, the, old, pagan, gods, earth, itself, was, not, considered, a, classical, planet, its, symbol, descends, from, a, pre, heliocentric, symbol, for, the, four, corners, of, the, world, when, further, planets, were, discovered, orbiting, the, sun, symbols, were, invented, for, them, the, most, common, astronomical, symbol, for, uranus, was, invented, by, johann, gottfried, k, hler, and, was, intended, to, represent, the, newly, discovered, metal, platinum, an, alternative, symbol, was, invented, by, j, r, me, lalande, and, represents, a, globe, with, a, h, on, top, for, uranus, s, discoverer, herschel, today, is, mostly, used, by, astronomers, and, by, astrologers, though, it, is, possible, to, find, each, symbol, in, the, other, context, the, first, few, asteroids, were, considered, to, be, planets, when, they, were, discovered, and, were, likewise, given, abstract, symbols, e, g, ceres, sickle, pallas, spear, juno, s, sceptre, and, vesta, s, hearth, however, as, their, number, rose, further, and, further, this, practice, stopped, in, favour, of, numbering, them, instead, massalia, the, first, asteroid, not, named, from, mythology, is, also, the, first, asteroid, that, was, not, assigned, a, symbol, by, its, discoverer, the, symbols, for, the, first, four, asteroids, ceres, through, vesta, remained, in, use, for, longer, than, the, others, and, even, in, the, modern, day, nasa, has, used, the, ceres, symbol, ceres, being, the, only, asteroid, that, is, also, a, dwarf, planet, neptune, s, symbol, represents, the, god, s, trident, the, astronomical, symbol, for, pluto, is, a, p, l, monogram, though, it, has, become, less, common, since, the, iau, definition, reclassified, pluto, since, pluto, s, reclassification, nasa, has, used, the, traditional, astrological, symbol, of, pluto, a, planetary, orb, over, pluto, s, bident, the, iau, discourages, the, use, of, planetary, symbols, in, modern, journal, articles, in, favour, of, one, letter, or, to, disambiguate, mercury, and, mars, two, letter, abbreviations, for, the, major, planets, the, symbols, for, the, sun, and, earth, are, nonetheless, common, as, solar, mass, earth, mass, and, similar, units, are, common, in, astronomy, other, planetary, symbols, today, are, mostly, encountered, in, astrology, astrologers, have, resurrected, the, old, astronomical, symbols, for, the, first, few, asteroids, and, continue, to, invent, symbols, for, other, objects, this, includes, relatively, standard, astrological, symbols, for, the, dwarf, planets, discovered, in, the, 21st, century, which, were, not, given, symbols, by, astronomers, because, planetary, symbols, had, mostly, fallen, out, of, use, in, astronomy, by, the, time, they, were, discovered, many, astrological, symbols, are, included, in, unicode, and, a, few, of, these, new, inventions, the, symbols, of, haumea, makemake, and, eris, have, since, been, used, by, nasa, in, astronomy, the, eris, symbol, is, a, traditional, one, from, discordianism, a, religion, worshipping, the, goddess, eris, the, other, dwarf, planet, symbols, are, mostly, initialisms, except, haumea, in, the, native, scripts, of, the, cultures, they, come, from, they, also, represent, something, associated, with, the,
