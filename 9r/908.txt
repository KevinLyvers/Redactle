coulomb, s, inverse, square, law, or, simply, coulomb, s, law, is, an, experimental, law, of, physics, that, calculates, the, amount, of, force, between, two, electrically, charged, particles, at, rest, this, electric, force, is, conventionally, called, the, electrostatic, force, or, coulomb, force, although, the, law, was, known, earlier, it, was, first, published, in, 1785, by, french, physicist, charles, augustin, de, coulomb, coulomb, s, law, was, essential, to, the, development, of, the, theory, of, electromagnetism, and, maybe, even, its, starting, point, as, it, allowed, meaningful, discussions, of, the, amount, of, electric, charge, in, a, particle, the, law, states, that, the, magnitude, or, absolute, value, of, the, attractive, or, repulsive, electrostatic, force, between, two, point, charges, is, directly, proportional, to, the, product, of, the, magnitudes, of, their, charges, and, inversely, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, distance, between, them, coulomb, discovered, that, bodies, with, like, electrical, charges, repel, it, follows, therefore, from, these, three, tests, that, the, repulsive, force, that, the, two, balls, electrified, with, the, same, kind, of, electricity, exert, on, each, other, follows, the, inverse, proportion, of, the, square, of, the, distance, coulomb, also, showed, that, oppositely, charged, bodies, attract, according, to, an, inverse, square, law, f, k, e, q, 1, q, 2, r, 2, displaystyle, f, k, text, e, frac, q, 1, q, 2, r, 2, here, k, e, is, a, constant, q, 1, and, q, 2, are, the, quantities, of, each, charge, and, the, scalar, r, is, the, distance, between, the, charges, the, force, is, along, the, straight, line, joining, the, two, charges, if, the, charges, have, the, same, sign, the, electrostatic, force, between, them, makes, them, repel, if, they, have, different, signs, the, force, between, them, makes, them, attract, being, an, inverse, square, law, the, law, is, similar, to, isaac, newton, s, inverse, square, law, of, universal, gravitation, but, gravitational, forces, always, make, things, attract, while, electrostatic, forces, make, charges, attract, or, repel, also, gravitational, forces, are, much, weaker, than, electrostatic, forces, coulomb, s, law, can, be, used, to, derive, gauss, s, law, and, vice, versa, in, the, case, of, a, single, point, charge, at, rest, the, two, laws, are, equivalent, expressing, the, same, physical, law, in, different, ways, the, law, has, been, tested, extensively, and, observations, have, upheld, the, law, on, the, scale, from, 10, 16, m, to, 10, 8, m, ancient, cultures, around, the, mediterranean, knew, that, certain, objects, such, as, rods, of, amber, could, be, rubbed, with, cat, s, fur, to, attract, light, objects, like, feathers, and, pieces, of, paper, thales, of, miletus, made, the, first, recorded, description, of, static, electricity, around, 600, bc, when, he, noticed, that, friction, could, make, a, piece, of, amber, attract, small, objects, in, 1600, english, scientist, william, gilbert, made, a, careful, study, of, electricity, and, magnetism, distinguishing, the, lodestone, effect, from, static, electricity, produced, by, rubbing, amber, he, coined, the, neo, latin, word, electricus, of, amber, or, like, amber, from, the, greek, word, for, amber, to, refer, to, the, property, of, attracting, small, objects, after, being, rubbed, this, association, gave, rise, to, the, english, words, electric, and, electricity, which, made, their, first, appearance, in, print, in, thomas, browne, s, pseudodoxia, epidemica, of, 1646, early, investigators, of, the, 18th, century, who, suspected, that, the, electrical, force, diminished, with, distance, as, the, force, of, gravity, did, i, e, as, the, inverse, square, of, the, distance, included, daniel, bernoulli, and, alessandro, volta, both, of, whom, measured, the, force, between, plates, of, a, capacitor, and, franz, aepinus, who, supposed, the, inverse, square, law, in, 1758, based, on, experiments, with, electrically, charged, spheres, joseph, priestley, of, england, was, among, the, first, to, propose, that, electrical, force, followed, an, inverse, square, law, similar, to, newton, s, law, of, universal, gravitation, however, he, did, not, generalize, or, elaborate, on, this, in, 1767, he, conjectured, that, the, force, between, charges, varied, as, the, inverse, square, of, the, distance, in, 1769, scottish, physicist, john, robison, announced, that, according, to, his, measurements, the, force, of, repulsion, between, two, spheres, with, charges, of, the, same, sign, varied, as, x, 2, 06, in, the, early, 1770s, the, dependence, of, the, force, between, charged, bodies, upon, both, distance, and, charge, had, already, been, discovered, but, not, published, by, henry, cavendish, of, england, in, his, notes, cavendish, wrote, we, may, therefore, conclude, that, the, electric, attraction, and, repulsion, must, be, inversely, as, some, power, of, the, distance, between, that, of, the, 2, 1, 50, th, and, that, of, the, 2, 1, 50, th, and, there, is, no, reason, to, think, that, it, differs, at, all, from, the, inverse, duplicate, ratio, finally, in, 1785, the, french, physicist, charles, augustin, de, coulomb, published, his, first, three, reports, of, electricity, and, magnetism, where, he, stated, his, law, this, publication, was, essential, to, the, development, of, the, theory, of, electromagnetism, he, used, a, torsion, balance, to, study, the, repulsion, and, attraction, forces, of, charged, particles, and, determined, that, the, magnitude, of, the, electric, force, between, two, point, charges, is, directly, proportional, to, the, product, of, the, charges, and, inversely, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, distance, between, them, the, torsion, balance, consists, of, a, bar, suspended, from, its, middle, by, a, thin, fiber, the, fiber, acts, as, a, very, weak, torsion, spring, in, coulomb, s, experiment, the, torsion, balance, was, an, insulating, rod, with, a, metal, coated, ball, attached, to, one, end, suspended, by, a, silk, thread, the, ball, was, charged, with, a, known, charge, of, static, electricity, and, a, second, charged, ball, of, the, same, polarity, was, brought, near, it, the, two, charged, balls, repelled, one, another, twisting, the, fiber, through, a, certain, angle, which, could, be, read, from, a, scale, on, the, instrument, by, knowing, how, much, force, it, took, to, twist, the, fiber, through, a, given, angle, coulomb, was, able, to, calculate, the, force, between, the, balls, and, derive, his, inverse, square, proportionality, law, coulomb, s, law, states, that, the, electrostatic, force, f, 1, textstyle, mathbf,

and, coulomb, s, law, can, still, be, considered, approximately, correct, a, more, accurate, approximation, in, this, case, is, however, the, weber, force, when, the, charges, are, moving, more,

if, placed, in, the, field, for, a, negative, point, source, charge, the, direction, is, radially, inwards, the, magnitude, of, the, electric, field, e, can, be, derived, from, coulomb, s, law, by, choosing, one, of, the, point, charges, to, be, the, source, and, the, other, to, be, the, test, charge, it, follows, from, coulomb, s, law, that, the, magnitude, of, the, electric, field, e, created,

between, the, positively, charged, atomic, nucleus, and, each, of, the, negatively, charged, electrons, this, simple, law, also, correctly, accounts, for, the, forces, that, bind, atoms, together, to, form, molecules, and, for, the, forces, that, bind, atoms, and, molecules, together, to, form, solids, and, liquids, generally, as, the, distance, between, ions, increases, the, force, of, attraction, and, binding, energy, approach, zero, and, ionic, bonding, is, less, favorable, as, the, magnitude, of, opposing, charges, increases, energy, increases, and, ionic, bonding, is, more, favorable, strictly, speaking, gauss, s, law, cannot, be, derived, from, coulomb, s, law, alone, since, coulomb, s, law, gives, the, electric, field, due, to, an, individual, electrostatic, point, charge, only, however, gauss, s, law, can, be, proven, from, coulomb, s, law, if, it, is, assumed, in, addition, that, the, electric, field, obeys, the, superposition, principle, the, superposition, principle,

law, does, not, give, any, information, regarding, the, curl, of, e, see, helmholtz, decomposition, and, faraday, s, law, however, coulomb, s, law, can, be, proven, from, gauss, s, law, if, it, is, assumed, in, addition, that, the, electric, field, from, a, point, charge, is, spherically, symmetric, this, assumption, like, coulomb, s, law, itself, is, exactly, true, if, the, charge, is, stationary, and, approximately, true, if, the, charge, is, in, motion, taking, s, in, the, integral, form, of, gauss, s, law, to, be, a, spherical, surface, of, radius, r, centered, at, the, point, charge, q, we, have, s, e, d, a, q, 0, displaystyle, oint, s, mathbf, e, cdot, d, mathbf, a, frac, q, varepsilon, 0, by, the, assumption, of, spherical, symmetry, the, integrand, is, a, constant,

unit, vector, pointing, radially, away, from, the, charge, again, by, spherical, symmetry, e, points, in, the, radial, direction, and, so, we, get, e, r, q, 4, 0, r, r, 2, displaystyle, mathbf, e, mathbf, r, frac, q, 4, pi, varepsilon, 0, frac, hat, mathbf, r, r, 2, which, is, essentially, equivalent, to, coulomb, s, law, thus, the, inverse, square, law, dependence, of, the, electric, field, in, coulomb, s, law, follows, from, gauss, s, law, coulomb, s, law, can, be, used, to, gain, insight, into, the, form, of, the, magnetic, field, generated, by, moving, charges, since, by, special, relativity, in, certain, cases, the, magnetic, field, can, be, shown, to, be, a, transformation, of, forces, caused, by, the, electric, field, when, no, acceleration, is, involved, in, a, particle, s, history, coulomb, s, law, can, be, assumed, on, any, test, particle, in, its, own, inertial, frame, supported, by, symmetry, arguments, in, solving, maxwell, s, equation, shown, above, coulomb, s, law, can, be, expanded, to, moving, test, particles, to, be, of, the, same, form, this, assumption, is, supported, by, lorentz, force, law, which, unlike, coulomb, s, law, is, not, limited, to, stationary, test, charges, considering, the, charge, to, be, invariant, of, observer, the, electric, and, magnetic, fields, of, a, uniformly, moving, point, charge, can, hence, be, derived, by, the, lorentz, transformation, of, the, four, force, on, the, test, charge, in, the, charge, s, frame, of, reference, given, by, coulomb, s, law, and, attributing, magnetic, and, electric, fields, by, their, definitions, given, by, the, form, of, lorentz, force, the, fields, hence, found, for, uniformly, moving, point, charges, are, given, by, e, q, 4, 0, r, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, sin, 2, 3, 2, r,

q, displaystyle, q, is, the, charge, of, the, point, source, r, displaystyle, mathbf, r, is, the, position, vector, from, the, point, source, to, the, point, in, space, v, displaystyle, mathbf, v, is, the, velocity, vector, of, the, charged, particle, displaystyle, beta, is, the, ratio, of, speed, of, the, charged, particle, divided, by, the, speed, of, light, and, displaystyle, theta, is, the, angle, between, r, displaystyle, mathbf, r, and, v, displaystyle, mathbf, v, this, form, of, solutions, need, not, obey, newton, s, third, law, as, is, the, case, in, the, framework, of, special, relativity, yet, without, violating, relativistic, energy, momentum, conservation, note, that, the, expression, for, electric, field, reduces, to, coulomb, s, law, for, non, relativistic, speeds, of, the, point, charge, and, that, the, magnetic, field, in, non, relativistic, limit, approximating, 1, displaystyle, beta, ll, 1, can, be, applied, to, electric, currents, to, get, the, biot, savart, law, these, solutions, when, expressed, in, retarded, time, also, correspond, to, the, general, solution, of, maxwell, s, equations, given, by, solutions, of, li, nard, wiechert, potential, due, to, the, validity, of, coulomb, s, law, within, its, specific, range, of, application, also, note, that, the, spherical, symmetry, for, gauss, law, on, stationary, charges, is, not, valid, for, moving, charges, owing, to, the, breaking, of, symmetry, by, the, specification, of, direction, of, velocity, in, the, problem, agreement, with, maxwell, s, equations, can, also, be, manually, verified, for, the, above, two, equations, the, coulomb, potential, admits, continuum, states, with, e, 0, describing, electron, proton, scattering, as, well, as, discrete, bound, states, representing, the,

transforming, both, sides, solving, the, integral, and, taking, 0, displaystyle, varepsilon, to, 0, at, the, end, will, yield, v, r, e, 2, 4, r, displaystyle, v, r, frac, e, 2, 4, pi, r, as, the, coulomb, potential, however, the, equivalent, results, of, the, classical, born, derivations, for, the, coulomb, problem, are, thought, to, be, strictly, accidental, the, coulomb, potential, and, its, derivation, can, be, seen, as, a, special, case, of, the, yukawa, potential, which, is, the, case, where, the, exchanged, boson, the, photon, has, no, rest, mass, it, is, possible, to, verify, coulomb, s, law, with, a, simple, experiment, consider, two, small, spheres, of, mass, m, displaystyle, m, and, same, sign, charge, q, displaystyle, q, hanging, from, two, ropes, of, negligible, mass, of, length, l, displaystyle, l, the, forces, acting, on, each, sphere, are, three, the, weight, m, g, displaystyle, mg, the, rope, tension, t, displaystyle, mathbf, t, and, the, electric, force, f, displaystyle, mathbf, f, in, the, equilibrium, state, and, dividing, 1, by, 2, let, l, 1, displaystyle, mathbf, l, 1, be, the, distance, between, the, charged, spheres, the, repulsion, force, between, them, f, 1, displaystyle, mathbf, f, 1, assuming, coulomb, s, law, is, correct, is, equal, to, so, if, we, now, discharge, one, of, the, spheres, and, we, put, it, in, contact, with, the, charged, sphere, each, one, of, them, acquires, a, charge, q, 2, textstyle, frac, q, 2, in, the, equilibrium, state, the, distance, between, the, charges, will, be, l, 2, l, 1, textstyle, mathbf, l, 2, mathbf, l, 1, and, the, repulsion, force, between, them, will, be, we, know, that, f, 2, m, g, tan, 2, displaystyle, mathbf, f, 2, mg, tan, theta, 2, and, q, 2, 4, 4, 0, l, 2, 2, m, g, tan, 2, displaystyle, frac, frac, q, 2, 4, 4, pi, varepsilon, 0, l, 2, 2, mg, tan, theta, 2, dividing, 4, by, 5, we, get, measuring, the, angles, 1, displaystyle, theta, 1, and, 2, displaystyle, theta, 2, and, the, distance, between, the, charges, l, 1, displaystyle, mathbf, l, 1, and, l, 2, displaystyle, mathbf, l, 2, is, sufficient, to, verify, that, the, equality, is, true, taking, into, account, the, experimental, error, in, practice, angles, can, be, difficult, to, measure, so, if, the, length, of, the, ropes, is, sufficiently, great, the, angles, will, be, small, enough, to, make, the, following, approximation, using, this, approximation, the, relationship, 6, becomes, the, much, simpler, expression, in, this, way, the, verification, is, limited, to, measuring, the, distance,
