ferromagnetism, is, a, property, of, certain, materials, such, as, iron, that, results, in, a, significant, observable, magnetic, permeability, and, in, many, cases, a, significant, magnetic, coercivity, allowing, the, material, to, form, a, permanent, magnet, ferromagnetic, materials, are, noticeably, attracted, to, a, magnet, which, is, a, consequence, of, their, substantial, magnetic, permeability, magnetic, permeability, describes, the, induced, magnetization, of, a, material, due, to, the, presence, of, an, external, magnetic, field, for, example, this, temporary, magnetization, inside, a, steel, plate, accounts, for, the, plate, s, attraction, to, a, magnet, whether, or, not, that, steel, plate, then, acquires, permanent, magnetization, depends, on, both, the, strength, of, the, applied, field, and, on, the, coercivity, of, that, particular, piece, of, steel, which, varies, with, the, steel, s, chemical, composition, and, any, heat, treatment, it, may, have, undergone, in, physics, multiple, types, of, material, magnetism, have, been, distinguished, ferromagnetism, along, with, the, similar, effect, ferrimagnetism, is, the, strongest, type, and, is, responsible, for, the, common, phenomenon, of, everyday, magnetism, an, example, of, a, permanent, magnet, formed, from, a, ferromagnetic, material, is, a, refrigerator, magnet, substances, respond, weakly, to, three, other, types, of, magnetism, paramagnetism, diamagnetism, and, antiferromagnetism, but, the, forces, are, usually, so, weak, that, they, can, be, detected, only, by, lab, instruments, permanent, magnets, materials, that, can, be, magnetized, by, an, external, magnetic, field, and, remain, magnetized, after, the, external, field, is, removed, are, either, ferromagnetic, or, ferrimagnetic, as, are, the, materials, that, are, attracted, to, them, relatively, few, materials, are, ferromagnetic, they, are, typically, pure, forms, alloys, or, compounds, of, iron, cobalt, nickel, and, certain, rare, earth, metals, ferromagnetism, is, vital, in, industrial, applications, and, modern, technologies, forming, the, basis, for, electrical, and, electromechanical, devices, such, as, electromagnets, electric, motors, generators, transformers, magnetic, storage, including, tape, recorders, and, hard, disks, and, nondestructive, testing, of, ferrous, materials, ferromagnetic, materials, can, be, divided, into, magnetically, soft, materials, like, annealed, iron, which, do, not, tend, to, stay, magnetized, and, magnetically, hard, materials, which, do, permanent, magnets, are, made, from, hard, ferromagnetic, materials, such, as, alnico, and, ferrimagnetic, materials, such, as, ferrite, that, are, subjected, to, special, processing, in, a, strong, magnetic, field, during, manufacturing, to, align, their, internal, microcrystalline, structure, making, them, difficult, to, demagnetize, to, demagnetize, a, saturated, magnet, a, magnetic, field, must, be, applied, the, threshold, at, which, demagnetization, occurs, depends, on, the, coercivity, of, the, material, magnetically, hard, materials, have, high, coercivity, whereas, magnetically, soft, materials, have, low, coercivity, the, overall, strength, of, a, magnet, is, measured, by, its, magnetic, moment, or, alternatively, its, total, magnetic, flux, the, local, strength, of, magnetism, in, a, material, is, measured, by, its, magnetization, historically, the, term, ferromagnetism, was, used, for, any, material, that, could, exhibit, spontaneous, magnetization, a, net, magnetic, moment, in, the, absence, of, an, external, magnetic, field, that, is, any, material, that, could, become, a, magnet, this, definition, is, still, in, common, use, in, a, landmark, paper, in, 1948, louis, n, el, showed, that, two, levels, of, magnetic, alignment, result, in, this, behavior, one, is, ferromagnetism, in, the, strict, sense, where, all, the, magnetic, moments, are, aligned, the, other, is, ferrimagnetism, where, some, magnetic, moments, point, in, the, opposite, direction, but, have, a, smaller, contribution, so, spontaneous, magnetization, is, present, 28, 29, in, the, special, case, where, the, opposing, moments, balance, completely, the, alignment, is, known, as, antiferromagnetism, antiferromagnets, do, not, have, a, spontaneous, magnetization, ferromagnetism, is, an, unusual, property, that, occurs, in, only, a, few, substances, the, common, ones, are, the, transition, metals, iron, nickel, and, cobalt, as, well, as, their, alloys, and, alloys, of, rare, earth, metals, it, is, a, property, not, just, of, the, chemical, make, up, of, a, material, but, of, its, crystalline, structure, and, microstructure, ferromagnetism, results, from, these, materials, having, many, unpaired, electrons, in, their, d, block, in, the, case, of, iron, and, its, relatives, or, f, block, in, the, case, of, the, rare, earth, metals, a, result, of, hund, s, rule, of, maximum, multiplicity, there, are, ferromagnetic, metal, alloys, whose, constituents, are, not, themselves, ferromagnetic, called, heusler, alloys, named, after, fritz, heusler, conversely, there, are, non, magnetic, alloys, such, as, types, of, stainless, steel, composed, almost, exclusively, of, ferromagnetic, metals, amorphous, non, crystalline, ferromagnetic, metallic, alloys, can, be, made, by, very, rapid, quenching, cooling, of, an, alloy, these, have, the, advantage, that, their, properties, are, nearly, isotropic, not, aligned, along, a, crystal, axis, this, results, in, low, coercivity, low, hysteresis, loss, high, permeability, and, high, electrical, resistivity, one, such, typical, material, is, a, transition, metal, metalloid, alloy, made, from, about, 80, transition, metal, usually, fe, co, or, ni, and, a, metalloid, component, b, c, si, p, or, al, that, lowers, the, melting, point, a, relatively, new, class, of, exceptionally, strong, ferromagnetic, materials, are, the, rare, earth, magnets, they, contain, lanthanide, elements, that, are, known, for, their, ability, to, carry, large, magnetic, moments, in, well, localized, f, orbitals, the, table, lists, a, selection, of, ferromagnetic, and, ferrimagnetic, compounds, along, with, their, curie, temperature, t, c, above, which, they, cease, to, exhibit, spontaneous, magnetization, most, ferromagnetic, materials, are, metals, since, the, conducting, electrons, are, often, responsible, for, mediating, the, ferromagnetic, interactions, it, is, therefore, a, challenge, to, develop, ferromagnetic, insulators, especially, multiferroic, materials, which, are, both, ferromagnetic, and, ferroelectric, a, number, of, actinide, compounds, are, ferromagnets, at, room, temperature, or, exhibit, ferromagnetism, upon, cooling, pu, p, is, a, paramagnet, with, cubic, symmetry, at, room, temperature, but, which, undergoes, a, structural, transition, into, a, tetragonal, state, with, ferromagnetic, order, when, cooled, below, its, t, c, 125, k, in, its, ferromagnetic, state, pup, s, easy, axis, is, in, the, 100, direction, in, np, fe, 2, the, easy, axis, is, 111, above, t, c, 500, k, npfe, 2, is, also, paramagnetic, and, cubic, cooling, below, the, curie, temperature, produces, a, rhombohedral, distortion, wherein, the, rhombohedral, angle, changes, from, 60, cubic, phase, to, 60, 53, an, alternate, description, of, this, distortion, is, to, consider, the, length, c, along, the, unique, trigonal, axis, after, the, distortion, has, begun, and, a, as, the, distance, in, the, plane, perpendicular, to, c, in, the, cubic, phase, this, reduces, to, c, a, 1, 00, below, the, curie, temperature, which, is, the, largest, strain, in, any, actinide, compound, npni, 2, undergoes, a, similar, lattice, distortion, below, t, c, 32, k, with, a, strain, of, 43, 5, 10, 4, npco, 2, is, a, ferrimagnet, below, 15, k, in, 2009, a, team, of, mit, physicists, demonstrated, that, a, lithium, gas, cooled, to, less, than, one, kelvin, can, exhibit, ferromagnetism, the, team, cooled, fermionic, lithium, 6, to, less, than, 150, nk, 150, billionths, of, one, kelvin, using, infrared, laser, cooling, this, demonstration, is, the, first, time, that, ferromagnetism, has, been, demonstrated, in, a, gas, in, rare, circumstances, ferromagnetism, can, be, observed, in, compounds, consisting, of, only, s, block, and, p, block, elements, such, as, rubidium, sesquioxide, in, 2018, a, team, of, university, of, minnesota, physicists, demonstrated, that, body, centered, tetragonal, ruthenium, exhibits, ferromagnetism, at, room, temperature, recent, research, has, shown, evidence, that, ferromagnetism, can, be, induced, in, some, materials, by, an, electric, current, or, voltage, antiferromagnetic, lamno, 3, and, srcoo, have, been, switched, to, be, ferromagnetic, by, a, current, in, july, 2020, scientists, reported, inducing, ferromagnetism, in, the, abundant, diamagnetic, material, iron, pyrite, fool, s, gold, by, an, applied, voltage, in, these, experiments, the, ferromagnetism, was, limited, to, a, thin, surface, layer, the, bohr, van, leeuwen, theorem, discovered, in, the, 1910s, showed, that, classical, physics, theories, are, unable, to, account, for, any, form, of, material, magnetism, including, ferromagnetism, the, explanation, rather, depends, on, the, quantum, mechanical, description, of, atoms, each, of, an, atom, s, electrons, has, a, magnetic, moment, according, to, its, spin, state, as, described, by, quantum, mechanics, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, also, a, consequence, of, quantum, mechanics, restricts, the, occupancy, of, electrons, spin, states, in, atomic, orbitals, generally, causing, the, magnetic, moments, from, an, atom, s, electrons, to, largely, or, completely, cancel, an, atom, will, have, a, net, magnetic, moment, when, that, cancellation, is, incomplete, one, of, the, fundamental, properties, of, an, electron, besides, that, it, carries, charge, is, that, it, has, a, magnetic, dipole, moment, i, e, it, behaves, like, a, tiny, magnet, producing, a, magnetic, field, this, dipole, moment, comes, from, a, more, fundamental, property, of, the, electron, its, quantum, mechanical, spin, due, to, its, quantum, nature, the, spin, of, the, electron, can, be, in, one, of, only, two, states, with, the, magnetic, field, either, pointing, up, or, down, for, any, choice, of, up, and, down, electron, spin, in, atoms, is, the, main, source, of, ferromagnetism, although, there, is, also, a, contribution, from, the, orbital, angular, momentum, of, the, electron, about, the, nucleus, when, these, magnetic, dipoles, in, a, piece, of, matter, are, aligned, point, in, the, same, direction, their, individually, tiny, magnetic, fields, add, together, to, create, a, much, larger, macroscopic, field, however, materials, made, of, atoms, with, filled, electron, shells, have, a, total, dipole, moment, of, zero, because, the, electrons, all, exist, in, pairs, with, opposite, spin, every, electron, s, magnetic, moment, is, cancelled, by, the, opposite, moment, of, the, second, electron, in, the, pair, only, atoms, with, partially, filled, shells, i, e, unpaired, spins, can, have, a, net, magnetic, moment, so, ferromagnetism, occurs, only, in, materials, with, partially, filled, shells, because, of, hund, s, rules, the, first, few, electrons, in, an, otherwise, unoccupied, shell, tend, to, have, the, same, spin, thereby, increasing, the, total, dipole, moment, these, unpaired, dipoles, often, called, simply, spins, even, though, they, also, generally, include, orbital, angular, momentum, tend, to, align, in, parallel, to, an, external, magnetic, field, leading, to, a, macroscopic, effect, called, paramagnetism, in, ferromagnetism, however, the, magnetic, interaction, between, neighboring, atoms, magnetic, dipoles, is, strong, enough, that, they, align, with, each, other, regardless, of, any, applied, field, resulting, in, the, spontaneous, magnetization, of, so, called, domains, this, results, in, the, large, observed, magnetic, permeability, of, ferromagnetics, and, the, ability, of, magnetically, hard, materials, to, form, permanent, magnets, when, two, nearby, atoms, have, unpaired, electrons, whether, the, electron, spins, are, parallel, or, antiparallel, affects, whether, the, electrons, can, share, the, same, orbit, as, a, result, of, the, quantum, mechanical, effect, called, the, exchange, interaction, this, in, turn, affects, the, electron, location, and, the, coulomb, electrostatic, interaction, and, thus, the, energy, difference, between, these, states, the, exchange, interaction, is, related, to, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, which, says, that, two, electrons, with, the, same, spin, cannot, also, be, in, the, same, spatial, state, orbital, this, is, a, consequence, of, the, spin, statistics, theorem, and, that, electrons, are, fermions, therefore, under, certain, conditions, when, the, orbitals, of, the, unpaired, outer, valence, electrons, from, adjacent, atoms, overlap, the, distributions, of, their, electric, charge, in, space, are, farther, apart, when, the, electrons, have, parallel, spins, than, when, they, have, opposite, spins, this, reduces, the, electrostatic, energy, of, the, electrons, when, their, spins, are, parallel, compared, to, their, energy, when, the, spins, are, antiparallel, so, the, parallel, spin, state, is, more, stable, this, difference, in, energy, is, called, the, exchange, energy, in, simple, terms, the, outer, electrons, of, adjacent, atoms, which, repel, each, other, can, move, further, apart, by, aligning, their, spins, in, parallel, so, the, spins, of, these, electrons, tend, to, line, up, this, energy, difference, can, be, orders, of, magnitude, larger, than, the, energy, differences, associated, with, the, magnetic, dipole, dipole, interaction, due, to, dipole, orientation, which, tends, to, align, the, dipoles, antiparallel, in, certain, doped, semiconductor, oxides, rkky, interactions, have, been, shown, to, bring, about, periodic, longer, range, magnetic, interactions, a, phenomenon, of, significance, in, the, study, of, spintronic, materials, the, materials, in, which, the, exchange, interaction, is, much, stronger, than, the, competing, dipole, dipole, interaction, are, frequently, called, magnetic, materials, for, instance, in, iron, fe, the, exchange, force, is, about, 1, 000, times, stronger, than, the, dipole, interaction, therefore, below, the, curie, temperature, virtually, all, of, the, dipoles, in, a, ferromagnetic, material, will, be, aligned, in, addition, to, ferromagnetism, the, exchange, interaction, is, also, responsible, for, the, other, types, of, spontaneous, ordering, of, atomic, magnetic, moments, occurring, in, magnetic, solids, antiferromagnetism, and, ferrimagnetism, there, are, different, exchange, interaction, mechanisms, which, create, the, magnetism, in, different, ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and, antiferromagnetic, substances, these, mechanisms, include, direct, exchange, rkky, exchange, double, exchange, and, superexchange, although, the, exchange, interaction, keeps, spins, aligned, it, does, not, align, them, in, a, particular, direction, without, magnetic, anisotropy, the, spins, in, a, magnet, randomly, change, direction, in, response, to, thermal, fluctuations, and, the, magnet, is, superparamagnetic, there, are, several, kinds, of, magnetic, anisotropy, the, most, common, of, which, is, magnetocrystalline, anisotropy, this, is, a, dependence, of, the, energy, on, the, direction, of, magnetization, relative, to, the, crystallographic, lattice, another, common, source, of, anisotropy, inverse, magnetostriction, is, induced, by, internal, strains, single, domain, magnets, also, can, have, a, shape, anisotropy, due, to, the, magnetostatic, effects, of, the, particle, shape, as, the, temperature, of, a, magnet, increases, the, anisotropy, tends, to, decrease, and, there, is, often, a, blocking, temperature, at, which, a, transition, to, superparamagnetism, occurs, the, spontaneous, alignment, of, magnetic, dipoles, in, ferromagnetic, materials, would, seem, to, suggest, that, every, piece, of, ferromagnetic, material, should, have, a, strong, magnetic, field, since, all, the, spins, are, aligned, yet, iron, and, other, ferromagnets, are, often, found, in, an, unmagnetized, state, this, is, because, a, bulk, piece, of, ferromagnetic, material, is, divided, into, tiny, regions, called, magnetic, domains, also, known, as, weiss, domains, within, each, domain, the, spins, are, aligned, but, if, the, bulk, material, is, in, its, lowest, energy, configuration, i, e, unmagnetized, the, spins, of, separate, domains, point, in, different, directions, and, their, magnetic, fields, cancel, out, so, the, bulk, material, has, no, net, large, scale, magnetic, field, ferromagnetic, materials, spontaneously, divide, into, magnetic, domains, because, the, exchange, interaction, is, a, short, range, force, so, over, long, distances, of, many, atoms, the, tendency, of, the, magnetic, dipoles, to, reduce, their, energy, by, orienting, in, opposite, directions, wins, out, if, all, the, dipoles, in, a, piece, of, ferromagnetic, material, are, aligned, parallel, it, creates, a, large, magnetic, field, extending, into, the, space, around, it, this, contains, a, lot, of, magnetostatic, energy, the, material, can, reduce, this, energy, by, splitting, into, many, domains, pointing, in, different, directions, so, the, magnetic, field, is, confined, to, small, local, fields, in, the, material, reducing, the, volume, of, the, field, the, domains, are, separated, by, thin, domain, walls, a, number, of, molecules, thick, in, which, the, direction, of, magnetization, of, the, dipoles, rotates, smoothly, from, one, domain, s, direction, to, the, other, thus, a, piece, of, iron, in, its, lowest, energy, state, unmagnetized, generally, has, little, or, no, net, magnetic, field, however, the, magnetic, domains, in, a, material, are, not, fixed, in, place, they, are, simply, regions, where, the, spins, of, the, electrons, have, aligned, spontaneously, due, to, their, magnetic, fields, and, thus, can, be, altered, by, an, external, magnetic, field, if, a, strong, enough, external, magnetic, field, is, applied, to, the, material, the, domain, walls, will, move, via, a, process, in, which, the, spins, of, the, electrons, in, atoms, near, the, wall, in, one, domain, turn, under, the, influence, of, the, external, field, to, face, in, the, same, direction, as, the, electrons, in, the, other, domain, thus, reorienting, the, domains, so, more, of, the, dipoles, are, aligned, with, the, external, field, the, domains, will, remain, aligned, when, the, external, field, is, removed, and, sum, to, create, a, magnetic, field, of, their, own, extending, into, the, space, around, the, material, thus, creating, a, permanent, magnet, the, domains, do, not, go, back, to, their, original, minimum, energy, configuration, when, the, field, is, removed, because, the, domain, walls, tend, to, become, pinned, or, snagged, on, defects, in, the, crystal, lattice, preserving, their, parallel, orientation, this, is, shown, by, the, barkhausen, effect, as, the, magnetizing, field, is, changed, the, material, s, magnetization, changes, in, thousands, of, tiny, discontinuous, jumps, as, domain, walls, suddenly, snap, past, defects, this, magnetization, as, a, function, of, an, external, field, is, described, by, a, hysteresis, curve, although, this, state, of, aligned, domains, found, in, a, piece, of, magnetized, ferromagnetic, material, is, not, a, minimal, energy, configuration, it, is, metastable, and, can, persist, for, long, periods, as, shown, by, samples, of, magnetite, from, the, sea, floor, which, have, maintained, their, magnetization, for, millions, of, years, heating, and, then, cooling, annealing, a, magnetized, material, subjecting, it, to, vibration, by, hammering, it, or, applying, a, rapidly, oscillating, magnetic, field, from, a, degaussing, coil, tends, to, release, the, domain, walls, from, their, pinned, state, and, the, domain, boundaries, tend, to, move, back, to, a, lower, energy, configuration, with, less, external, magnetic, field, thus, demagnetizing, the, material, commercial, magnets, are, made, of, hard, ferromagnetic, or, ferrimagnetic, materials, with, very, large, magnetic, anisotropy, such, as, alnico, and, ferrites, which, have, a, very, strong, tendency, for, the, magnetization, to, be, pointed, along, one, axis, of, the, crystal, the, easy, axis, during, manufacture, the, materials, are, subjected, to, various, metallurgical, processes, in, a, powerful, magnetic, field, which, aligns, the, crystal, grains, so, their, easy, axes, of, magnetization, all, point, in, the, same, direction, thus, the, magnetization, and, the, resulting, magnetic, field, is, built, in, to, the, crystal, structure, of, the, material, making, it, very, difficult, to, demagnetize, as, the, temperature, of, a, material, increases, thermal, motion, or, entropy, competes, with, the, ferromagnetic, tendency, for, dipoles, to, align, when, the, temperature, rises, beyond, a, certain, point, called, the, curie, temperature, there, is, a, second, order, phase, transition, and, the, system, can, no, longer, maintain, a, spontaneous, magnetization, so, its, ability, to, be, magnetized, or, attracted, to, a, magnet, disappears, although, it, still, responds, paramagnetically, to, an, external, field, below, that, temperature, there, is, a, spontaneous, symmetry, breaking, and, magnetic, moments, become, aligned, with, their, neighbors, the, curie, temperature, itself, is, a, critical, point, where, the, magnetic, susceptibility, is, theoretically, infinite, and, although, there, is, no, net, magnetization, domain, like, spin, correlations, fluctuate, at, all, length, scales, the, study, of, ferromagnetic, phase, transitions, especially, via, the, simplified, ising, spin, model, had, an, important, impact, on, the, development, of, statistical, physics, there, it, was, first, clearly, shown, that, mean, field, theory, approaches, failed, to, predict, the, correct, behavior, at, the, critical, point, which, was, found, to, fall, under, a, universality, class, that, includes, many, other, systems, such, as, liquid, gas, transitions, and, had, to, be, replaced, by, renormalization, group, theory
