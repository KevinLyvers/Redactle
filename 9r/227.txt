in, cosmology, the, cosmological, constant, usually, denoted, by, the, greek, capital, letter, lambda, alternatively, called, einstein, s, cosmological, constant, is, a, coefficient, that, albert, einstein, initially, added, to, his, field, equations, of, general, relativity, he, later, removed, it, however, much, later, it, was, revived, to, express, the, energy, density, of, space, or, vacuum, energy, that, arises, in, quantum, mechanics, it, is, closely, associated, with, the, concept, of, dark, energy, einstein, introduced, the, constant, in, 1917, to, counterbalance, the, effect, of, gravity, and, achieve, a, static, universe, which, was, then, assumed, einstein, s, cosmological, constant, was, abandoned, after, edwin, hubble, confirmed, that, the, universe, was, expanding, from, the, 1930s, until, the, late, 1990s, most, physicists, agreed, with, einstein, s, choice, of, setting, the, cosmological, constant, to, zero, that, changed, with, the, discovery, in, 1998, that, the, expansion, of, the, universe, is, accelerating, implying, that, the, cosmological, constant, may, have, a, positive, value, since, the, 1990s, studies, have, shown, that, assuming, the, cosmological, principle, around, 68, of, the, mass, energy, density, of, the, universe, can, be, attributed, to, dark, energy, the, cosmological, constant, is, the, simplest, possible, explanation, for, dark, energy, and, is, used, in, the, standard, model, of, cosmology, known, as, the, cdm, model, according, to, quantum, field, theory, qft, which, underlies, modern, particle, physics, empty, space, is, defined, by, the, vacuum, state, which, is, composed, of, a, collection, of, quantum, fields, all, these, quantum, fields, exhibit, fluctuations, in, their, ground, state, lowest, energy, density, arising, from, the, zero, point, energy, existing, everywhere, in, space, these, zero, point, fluctuations, should, contribute, to, the, cosmological, constant, but, actual, calculations, give, rise, to, an, enormous, vacuum, energy, the, discrepancy, between, theorized, vacuum, energy, from, quantum, field, theory, and, observed, vacuum, energy, from, cosmology, is, a, source, of, major, contention, with, the, values, predicted, exceeding, observation, by, some, 120, orders, of, magnitude, a, discrepancy, that, has, been, called, the, worst, theoretical, prediction, in, the, history, of, physics, this, issue, is, called, the, cosmological, constant, problem, and, it, is, one, of, the, greatest, mysteries, in, science, with, many, physicists, believing, that, the, vacuum, holds, the, key, to, a, full, understanding, of, nature, the, cosmological, constant, was, originally, introduced, in, einstein, s, 1917, paper, entitled, the, cosmological, considerations, in, the, general, theory, of, reality, einstein, included, the, cosmological, constant, as, a, term, in, his, field, equations, for, general, relativity, because, he, was, dissatisfied, that, otherwise, his, equations, did, not, allow, for, a, static, universe, gravity, would, cause, a, universe, that, was, initially, non, expanding, to, contract, to, counteract, this, possibility, einstein, added, the, cosmological, constant, however, einstein, was, not, happy, about, adding, this, cosmological, term, he, later, stated, that, since, i, introduced, this, term, i, had, always, a, bad, conscience, i, am, unable, to, believe, that, such, an, ugly, thing, is, actually, realized, in, nature, einstein, s, static, universe, is, unstable, against, matter, density, perturbations, furthermore, without, the, cosmological, constant, einstein, could, have, found, the, expansion, of, the, universe, before, hubble, s, observations, in, 1929, not, long, after, einstein, developed, his, static, theory, observations, by, edwin, hubble, indicated, that, the, universe, appears, to, be, expanding, this, was, consistent, with, a, cosmological, solution, to, the, original, general, relativity, equations, that, had, been, found, by, the, mathematician, alexander, friedmann, working, on, the, einstein, equations, of, general, relativity, einstein, reportedly, referred, to, his, failure, to, accept, the, validation, of, his, equations, when, they, had, predicted, the, expansion, of, the, universe, in, theory, before, it, was, demonstrated, in, observation, of, the, cosmological, redshift, as, his, biggest, blunder, according, to, george, gamow, it, transpired, that, adding, the, cosmological, constant, to, einstein, s, equations, does, not, lead, to, a, static, universe, at, equilibrium, because, the, equilibrium, is, unstable, if, the, universe, expands, slightly, then, the, expansion, releases, vacuum, energy, which, causes, yet, more, expansion, likewise, a, universe, that, contracts, slightly, will, continue, contracting, however, the, cosmological, constant, remained, a, subject, of, theoretical, and, empirical, interest, empirically, the, cosmological, data, of, recent, decades, strongly, suggests, that, our, universe, has, a, positive, cosmological, constant, the, explanation, of, this, small, but, positive, value, is, a, remaining, theoretical, challenge, the, so, called, cosmological, constant, problem, some, early, generalizations, of, einstein, s, gravitational, theory, known, as, classical, unified, field, theories, either, introduced, a, cosmological, constant, on, theoretical, grounds, or, found, that, it, arose, naturally, from, the, mathematics, for, example, arthur, eddington, claimed, that, the, cosmological, constant, version, of, the, vacuum, field, equation, expressed, the, epistemological, property, that, the, universe, is, self, gauging, and, erwin, schr, dinger, s, pure, affine, theory, using, a, simple, variational, principle, produced, the, field, equation, with, a, cosmological, term, in, 1990s, saul, perlmutter, at, lawrence, berkeley, national, laboratory, brian, schmidt, of, the, australian, national, university, and, adam, riess, of, the, space, telescope, science, institute, were, searching, for, type, ia, supernovas, by, that, time, they, expected, to, observe, the, deceleration, of, the, supernovas, caused, by, the, gravitation, attraction, of, mass, according, to, einstein, s, gravitational, theory, the, first, reports, published, in, july, 1997, from, supernova, cosmology, project, used, the, supernova, observation, to, support, such, deceleration, hypothesis, but, soon, they, found, that, supernovas, were, flying, away, in, an, accelerating, manner, in, 1998, both, teams, announced, this, surprising, result, it, implied, the, universe, is, under, accelerating, expansion, the, cosmological, constant, is, needed, to, explain, such, acceleration, after, this, discovery, the, cosmological, constant, was, put, back, to, the, equation, of, general, relativity, the, cosmological, constant, appears, in, the, einstein, field, equations, in, the, form, r, 1, 2, r, g, g, t, displaystyle, r, mu, nu, tfrac, 1, 2, r, g, mu, nu, lambda, g, mu, nu, kappa, t, mu, nu, where, the, ricci, tensor, r, ricci, scalar, r, and, the, metric, tensor, g, describe, the, structure, of, spacetime, the, stress, energy, tensor, t, describes, the, energy, density, momentum, density, and, stress, at, that, point, in, spacetime, and, 8, g, c, 4, the, gravitational, constant, g, and, the, speed, of, light, c, are, universal, constants, when, is, zero, this, reduces, to, the, field, equation, of, general, relativity, usually, used, in, the, 20th, century, when, t, is, zero, the, field, equation, describes, empty, space, a, vacuum, the, cosmological, constant, has, the, same, effect, as, an, intrinsic, energy, density, of, the, vacuum, vac, and, an, associated, pressure, in, this, context, it, is, commonly, moved, to, the, right, hand, side, of, the, equation, using, vac, it, is, common, to, quote, values, of, energy, density, directly, though, still, using, the, name, cosmological, constant, the, dimension, of, is, generally, understood, as, length, 2, using, the, values, known, in, 2018, and, planck, units, for, 0, 6889, 0, 0056, and, the, hubble, constant, h, 0,

positive, vacuum, energy, density, resulting, from, a, cosmological, constant, implies, a, negative, pressure, and, vice, versa, if, the, energy, density, is, positive, the, associated, negative, pressure, will, drive, an, accelerated, expansion, of, the, universe, as, observed, see, dark, energy, and, cosmic, inflation, for, details, instead, of, the, cosmological, constant, itself, cosmologists, often, refer, to, the, ratio, between, the, energy, density, due, to, the, cosmological, constant, and, the, critical, density, of, the, universe, the, tipping, point, for, a, sufficient, density, to, stop, the, universe, from, expanding, forever, this, ratio, is, usually, denoted, by, and, is, estimated, to, be, 0, 6889, 0, 0056, according, to, results, published, by, the, planck, collaboration, in, 2018, in, a, flat, universe, is, the, fraction, of, the, energy, of, the, universe, due, to, the, cosmological, constant, i, e, what, we, would, intuitively, call, the, fraction, of, the, universe, that, is, made, up, of, dark, energy, note, that, this, value, changes, over, time, the, critical, density, changes, with, cosmological, time, but, the, energy, density, due, to, the, cosmological, constant, remains, unchanged, throughout, the, history, of, the, universe, because, the, amount, of, dark, energy, increases, as, the, universe, grows, but, the, amount, of, matter, does, not, another, ratio, that, is, used, by, scientists, is, the, equation, of, state, usually, denoted, w, which, is, the, ratio, of, pressure, that, dark, energy, puts, on, the, universe, to, the, energy, per, unit, volume, this, ratio, is, w, 1, for, the, cosmological, constant, used, in, the, einstein, equations, alternative, time, varying, forms, of, vacuum, energy, such, as, quintessence, generally, use, a, different, value, the, value, w, 1, 028, 0, 032, measured, by, the, planck, collaboration, 2018, is, consistent, with, 1, assuming, w, does, not, change, over, cosmic, time, observations, announced, in, 1998, of, distance, redshift, relation, for, type, ia, supernovae, indicated, that, the, expansion, of, the, universe, is, accelerating, if, one, assumes, the, cosmological, principle, when, combined, with, measurements, of, the, cosmic, microwave, background, radiation, these, implied, a, value, of, 0, 7, a, result, which, has, been, supported, and, refined, by, more, recent, measurements, as, well, as, previous, works, if, one, assumes, the, cosmological, principle, as, in, the, case, for, all, models, that, use, the, friedmann, lema, tre, robertson, walker, metric, while, there, are, other, possible, causes, of, an, accelerating, universe, such, as, quintessence, the, cosmological, constant, is, in, most, respects, the, simplest, solution, thus, the, lambda, cdm, model, the, current, standard, model, of, cosmology, which, uses, the, flrw, metric, includes, the, cosmological, constant, which, is, measured, to, be, on, the, order, of, 10, 52, m, 2, it, may, be, expressed, as, 10, 35, s, 2, multiplying, by, c, 2, 10, 17, m, 2, s, 2, or, as, 10, 122, p, 2, where, p, is, the, planck, length, the, value, is, based, on, recent, measurements, of, vacuum, energy, density, vac, 5, 96, 10, 27, kg, m, 3, 5, 3566, 10, 10, j, m, 3, 3, 35, gev, m, 3, however, due, to, the, hubble, tension, and, the, cmb, dipole, recently, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, cosmological, principle, is, no, longer, true, in, the, late, universe, and, that, the, flrw, metric, breaks, down, so, it, is, possible, that, observations, usually, attributed, to, an, accelerating, universe, are, simply, a, result, of, the, cosmological, principle, not, applying, in, the, late, universe, as, was, only, recently, seen, by, works, of, t, hooft, susskind, and, others, a, positive, cosmological, constant, has, surprising, consequences, such, as, a, finite, maximum, entropy, of, the, observable, universe, see, holographic, principle, a, major, outstanding, problem, is, that, most, quantum, field, theories, predict, a, huge, value, for, the, quantum, vacuum, a, common, assumption, is, that, the, quantum, vacuum, is, equivalent, to, the, cosmological, constant, although, no, theory, exists, that, supports, this, assumption, arguments, can, be, made, in, its, favor, such, arguments, are, usually, based, on, dimensional, analysis, and, effective, field, theory, if, the, universe, is, described, by, an, effective, local, quantum, field, theory, down, to, the, planck, scale, then, we, would, expect, a, cosmological, constant, of, the, order, of, m, p, l, 2, textstyle, m, rm, pl, 2, 1, textstyle, 1, in, reduced, planck, units, as, noted, above, the, measured, cosmological, constant, is, smaller, than, this, by, a, factor, of, 10, 120, this, discrepancy, has, been, called, the, worst, theoretical, prediction, in, the, history, of, physics, some, supersymmetric, theories, require, a, cosmological, constant, that, is, exactly, zero, which, further, complicates, things, this, is, the, cosmological, constant, problem, the, worst, problem, of, fine, tuning, in, physics, there, is, no, known, natural, way, to, derive, the, tiny, cosmological, constant, used, in, cosmology, from, particle, physics, no, vacuum, in, the, string, theory, landscape, is, known, to, support, a, metastable, positive, cosmological, constant, and, in, 2018, a, group, of, four, physicists, advanced, a, controversial, conjecture, which, would, imply, that, no, such, universe, exists, one, possible, explanation, for, the, small, but, non, zero, value, was, noted, by, steven, weinberg, in, 1987, following, the, anthropic, principle, weinberg, explains, that, if, the, vacuum, energy, took, different, values, in, different, domains, of, the, universe, then, observers, would, necessarily, measure, values, similar, to, that, which, is, observed, the, formation, of, life, supporting, structures, would, be, suppressed, in, domains, where, the, vacuum, energy, is, much, larger, specifically, if, the, vacuum, energy, is, negative, and, its, absolute, value, is, substantially, larger, than, it, appears, to, be, in, the, observed, universe, say, a, factor, of, 10, larger, holding, all, other, variables, e, g, matter, density, constant, that, would, mean, that, the, universe, is, closed, furthermore, its, lifetime, would, be, shorter, than, the, age, of, our, universe, possibly, too, short, for, intelligent, life, to, form, on, the, other, hand, a, universe, with, a, large, positive, cosmological, constant, would, expand, too, fast, preventing, galaxy, formation, according, to, weinberg, domains, where, the, vacuum, energy, is, compatible, with, life, would, be, comparatively, rare, using, this, argument, weinberg, predicted, that, the, cosmological, constant, would, have, a, value, of, less, than, a, hundred, times, the, currently, accepted, value, in, 1992, weinberg, refined, this, prediction, of, the, cosmological, constant, to, 5, to, 10, times, the, matter, density, this, argument, depends, on, the, vacuum, energy, density, being, constant, throughout, spacetime, as, would, be, expected, if, dark, energy, were, the, cosmological, constant, there, is, no, evidence, that, the, vacuum, energy, does, vary, but, it, may, be, the, case, if, for, example, the, vacuum, energy, is, even, in, part, the, potential, of, a, scalar, field, such, as, the, residual, inflaton, also, see, quintessence, another, theoretical, approach, that, deals, with, the, issue, is, that, of, multiverse, theories, which, predict, a, large, number, of, parallel, universes, with, different, laws, of, physics, and, or, values, of, fundamental, constants, again, the, anthropic, principle, states, that, we, can, only, live, in, one, of, the, universes, that, is, compatible, with, some, form, of, intelligent, life, critics, claim, that, these, theories, when, used, as, an, explanation, for, fine, tuning, commit, the, inverse, gambler, s, fallacy, in, 1995, weinberg, s, argument, was, refined, by, alexander, vilenkin, to, predict, a, value, for, the, cosmological, constant, that, was, only, ten, times, the, matter, density, i, e, about, three, times, the, current, value, since, determined, an, attempt, to, directly, observe, and, relate, quanta, or, fields, like, the, chameleon, particle, or, the, symmetron, theory, to, dark, energy, in, a, laboratory, setting, failed, to, detect, a, new, force, inferring, the, presence, of, dark, energy, through, its, interaction, with, baryons, in, the, cosmic, microwave, background, has, also, led, to, a, negative, result, although, the, current, analyses, have, been, derived, only, at, the, linear, perturbation, regime, it, is, also, possible, that, the, difficulty, in, detecting, dark, energy, is, due, to, the, fact, that, the, cosmological, constant, describes, an, existing, known, interaction, e, g, electromagnetic, field
