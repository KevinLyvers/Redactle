melting, or, fusion, is, a, physical, process, that, results, in, the, phase, transition, of, a, substance, from, a, solid, to, a, liquid, this, occurs, when, the, internal, energy, of, the, solid, increases, typically, by, the, application, of, heat, or, pressure, which, increases, the, substance, s, temperature, to, the, melting, point, at, the, melting, point, the, ordering, of, ions, or, molecules, in, the, solid, breaks, down, to, a, less, ordered, state, and, the, solid, melts, to, become, a, liquid, substances, in, the, molten, state, generally, have, reduced, viscosity, as, the, temperature, increases, an, exception, to, this, principle, is, elemental, sulfur, whose, viscosity, increases, in, the, range, of, 160, c, to, 180, c, due, to, polymerization, some, organic, compounds, melt, through, mesophases, states, of, partial, order, between, solid, and, liquid, from, a, thermodynamics, point, of, view, at, the, melting, point, the, change, in, gibbs, free, energy, g, of, the, substances, is, zero, but, there, are, non, zero, changes, in, the, enthalpy, h, and, the, entropy, s, known, respectively, as, the, enthalpy, of, fusion, or, latent, heat, of, fusion, and, the, entropy, of, fusion, melting, is, therefore, classified, as, a, first, order, phase, transition, melting, occurs, when, the, gibbs, free, energy, of, the, liquid, becomes, lower, than, the, solid, for, that, material, the, temperature, at, which, this, occurs, is, dependent, on, the, ambient, pressure, low, temperature, helium, is, the, only, known, exception, to, the, general, rule, helium, 3, has, a, negative, enthalpy, of, fusion, at, temperatures, below, 0, 3, k, helium, 4, also, has, a, very, slightly, negative, enthalpy, of, fusion, below, 0, 8, k, this, means, that, at, appropriate, constant, pressures, heat, must, be, removed, from, these, substances, in, order, to, melt, them, among, the, theoretical, criteria, for, melting, the, lindemann, and, born, criteria, are, those, most, frequently, used, as, a, basis, to, analyse, the, melting, conditions, the, lindemann, criterion, states, that, melting, occurs, because, of, vibrational, instability, e, g, crystals, melt, when, the, average, amplitude, of, thermal, vibrations, of, atoms, is, relatively, high, compared, with, interatomic, distances, e, g, u, 2, 1, 2, l, r, s, where, u, is, the, atomic, displacement, the, lindemann, parameter, l, 0, 20, 0, 25, and, r, s, is, one, half, of, the, inter, atomic, distance, 177, the, lindemann, melting, criterion, is, supported, by, experimental, data, both, for, crystalline, materials, and, for, glass, liquid, transitions, in, amorphous, materials, the, born, criterion, is, based, on, a, rigidity, catastrophe, caused, by, the, vanishing, elastic, shear, modulus, i, e, when, the, crystal, no, longer, has, sufficient, rigidity, to, mechanically, withstand, the, load, it, becomes, liquid, under, a, standard, set, of, conditions, the, melting, point, of, a, substance, is, a, characteristic, property, the, melting, point, is, often, equal, to, the, freezing, point, however, under, carefully, created, conditions, supercooling, or, superheating, past, the, melting, or, freezing, point, can, occur, water, on, a, very, clean, glass, surface, will, often, supercool, several, degrees, below, the, freezing, point, without, freezing, fine, emulsions, of, pure, water, have, been, cooled, to, 38, c, without, nucleation, to, form, ice, nucleation, occurs, due, to, fluctuations, in, the, properties, of, the, material, if, the, material, is, kept, still, there, is, often, nothing, such, as, physical, vibration, to, trigger, this, change, and, supercooling, or, superheating, may, occur, thermodynamically, the, supercooled, liquid, is, in, the, metastable, state, with, respect, to, the, crystalline, phase, and, it, is, likely, to, crystallize, suddenly, glasses, are, amorphous, solids, which, are, usually, fabricated, when, the, molten, material, cools, very, rapidly, to, below, its, glass, transition, temperature, without, sufficient, time, for, a, regular, crystal, lattice, to, form, solids, are, characterised, by, a, high, degree, of, connectivity, between, their, molecules, and, fluids, have, lower, connectivity, of, their, structural, blocks, melting, of, a, solid, material, can, also, be, considered, as, a, percolation, via, broken, connections, between, particles, e, g, connecting, bonds, in, this, approach, melting, of, an, amorphous, material, occurs, when, the, broken, bonds, form, a, percolation, cluster, with, t, g, dependent, on, quasi, equilibrium, thermodynamic, parameters, of, bonds, e, g, on, enthalpy, h, d, and, entropy, s, d, of, formation, of, bonds, in, a, given, system, at, given, conditions, where, f, c, is, the, percolation, threshold, and, r, is, the, universal, gas, constant, although, h, d, and, s, d, are, not, true, equilibrium, thermodynamic, parameters, and, can, depend, on, the, cooling, rate, of, a, melt, they, can, be, found, from, available, experimental, data, on, viscosity, of, amorphous, materials, even, below, its, melting, point, quasi, liquid, films, can, be, observed, on, crystalline, surfaces, the, thickness, of, the, film, is, temperature, dependent, this, effect, is, common, for, all, crystalline, materials, this, pre, melting, shows, its, effects, in, e, g, frost, heave, the, growth, of, snowflakes, and, taking, grain, boundary, interfaces, into, account, maybe, even, in, the, movement, of, glaciers, in, ultrashort, pulse, physics, a, so, called, nonthermal, melting, may, take, place, it, occurs, not, because, of, the, increase, of, the, atomic, kinetic, energy, but, because, of, changes, of, the, interatomic, potential, due, to, excitation, of, electrons, since, electrons, are, acting, like, a, glue, sticking, atoms, together, heating, electrons, by, a, femtosecond, laser, alters, the, properties, of, this, glue, which, may, break, the, bonds, between, the, atoms, and, melt, a, material, even, without, an, increase, of, the, atomic, temperature, in, genetics, melting, dna, means, to, separate, the, double, stranded, dna, into, two, single, strands, by, heating, or, the, use, of, chemical, agents, polymerase, chain, reaction
