ammonia, is, an, inorganic, chemical, compound, of, nitrogen, and, hydrogen, with, the, formula, n, h, 3, a, stable, binary, hydride, and, the, simplest, pnictogen, hydride, ammonia, is, a, colourless, gas, with, a, distinctive, pungent, smell, biologically, it, is, a, common, nitrogenous, waste, and, it, contributes, significantly, to, the, nutritional, needs, of, terrestrial, organisms, by, serving, as, a, precursor, to, fertilisers, around, 70, of, ammonia, produced, industrially, is, used, to, make, fertilisers, in, various, forms, and, composition, such, as, urea, and, diammonium, phosphate, ammonia, in, pure, form, is, also, applied, directly, into, the, soil, ammonia, either, directly, or, indirectly, is, also, a, building, block, for, the, synthesis, of, many, chemicals, ammonia, occurs, in, nature, and, has, been, detected, in, the, interstellar, medium, in, many, countries, it, is, classified, as, an, extremely, hazardous, substance, ammonia, is, produced, biologically, in, a, process, called, nitrogen, fixation, but, even, more, is, generated, industrially, by, the, haber, process, the, process, helped, revolutionize, agriculture, by, providing, cheap, fertilizers, the, global, industrial, production, of, ammonia, in, 2021, was, 235, million, tonnes, industrial, ammonia, is, transported, in, tank, cars, or, cylinders, nh, 3, boils, at, 33, 34, c, 28, 012, f, at, a, pressure, of, one, atmosphere, but, the, liquid, can, often, be, handled, in, the, laboratory, without, external, cooling, household, ammonia, or, ammonium, hydroxide, is, a, solution, of, nh, 3, in, water, pliny, in, book, xxxi, of, his, natural, history, refers, to, a, salt, named, hammoniacum, so, called, because, of, the, proximity, of, its, source, to, the, temple, of, jupiter, amun, greek, ammon, in, the, roman, province, of, cyrenaica, however, the, description, pliny, gives, of, the, salt, does, not, conform, to, the, properties, of, ammonium, chloride, according, to, herbert, hoover, s, commentary, in, his, english, translation, of, georgius, agricola, s, de, re, metallica, it, is, likely, to, have, been, common, sea, salt, in, any, case, that, salt, ultimately, gave, ammonia, and, ammonium, compounds, their, name, traces, of, ammonia, ammonium, are, found, in, rainwater, ammonium, chloride, sal, ammoniac, and, ammonium, sulfate, are, found, in, volcanic, districts, crystals, of, ammonium, bicarbonate, have, been, found, in, patagonia, guano, ammonia, is, found, throughout, the, solar, system, on, mars, jupiter, saturn, uranus, neptune, and, pluto, among, other, places, on, smaller, icy, bodies, such, as, pluto, ammonia, can, act, as, a, geologically, important, antifreeze, as, a, mixture, of, water, and, ammonia, can, have, a, melting, point, as, low, as, 100, c, 148, f, 173, k, if, the, ammonia, concentration, is, high, enough, and, thus, allow, such, bodies, to, retain, internal, oceans, and, active, geology, at, a, far, lower, temperature, than, would, be, possible, with, water, alone, substances, containing, ammonia, or, those, that, are, similar, to, it, are, called, ammoniacal, ammonia, is, a, colourless, gas, with, a, characteristically, pungent, smell, it, is, lighter, than, air, its, density, being, 0, 589, times, that, of, air, it, is, easily, liquefied, due, to, the, strong, hydrogen, bonding, between, molecules, gaseous, ammonia, turns, to, a, colourless, liquid, which, boils, at, 33, 1, c, 27, 58, f, and, freezes, to, colourless, crystals, at, 77, 7, c, 107, 86, f, little, data, is, available, at, very, high, temperatures, and, pressures, but, the, liquid, vapor, critical, point, occurs, at, 405, k, and, 11, 35, mpa, the, crystal, symmetry, is, cubic, pearson, symbol, cp16, space, group, p2, 1, 3, no, 198, lattice, constant, 0, 5125, nm, liquid, ammonia, possesses, strong, ionising, powers, reflecting, its, high, of, 22, at, 35, c, 31, f, liquid, ammonia, has, a, very, high, standard, enthalpy, change, of, vapourization, 23, 5, kj, mol, for, comparison, water, s, is, 40, 65, kj, mol, methane, 8, 19, kj, mol, and, phosphine, 14, 6, kj, mol, and, can, be, transported, in, pressurized, or, refrigerated, vessels, however, at, standard, temperature, and, pressure, liquid, anhydrous, ammonia, will, vaporize, ammonia, readily, dissolves, in, water, in, an, aqueous, solution, it, can, be, expelled, by, boiling, the, aqueous, solution, of, ammonia, is, basic, and, may, be, described, as, aqueous, ammonia, or, ammonium, hydroxide, the, maximum, concentration, of, ammonia, in, water, a, saturated, solution, has, a, specific, gravity, of, 0, 880, and, is, often, known, as, 880, ammonia, liquid, ammonia, is, a, widely, studied, nonaqueous, ionising, solvent, its, most, conspicuous, property, is, its, ability, to, dissolve, alkali, metals, to, form, highly, coloured, electrically, conductive, solutions, containing, solvated, electrons, apart, from, these, remarkable, solutions, much, of, the, chemistry, in, liquid, ammonia, can, be, classified, by, analogy, with, related, reactions, in, aqueous, solutions, comparison, of, the, physical, properties, of, nh, 3, with, those, of, water, shows, nh, 3, has, the, lower, melting, point, boiling, point, density, viscosity, dielectric, constant, and, electrical, conductivity, these, differences, are, attributed, at, least, in, part, to, the, weaker, hydrogen, bonding, in, nh, 3, the, ionic, self, dissociation, constant, of, liquid, nh, 3, at, 50, c, is, about, 10, 33, liquid, ammonia, is, an, ionising, solvent, although, less, so, than, water, and, dissolves, a, range, of, ionic, compounds, including, many, nitrates, nitrites, cyanides, thiocyanates, metal, cyclopentadienyl, complexes, and, metal, bis, trimethylsilyl, amides, most, ammonium, salts, are, soluble, and, act, as, acids, in, liquid, ammonia, solutions, the, solubility, of, halide, salts, increases, from, fluoride, to, iodide, a, saturated, solution, of, ammonium, nitrate, divers, solution, named, after, edward, divers, contains, 0, 83, mol, solute, per, mole, of, ammonia, and, has, a, vapour, pressure, of, less, than, 1, bar, even, at, 25, c, 77, f, however, few, oxyanion, salts, with, other, cations, dissolve, liquid, ammonia, will, dissolve, all, of, the, alkali, metals, and, other, electropositive, metals, such, as, ca, sr, ba, eu, and, yb, also, mg, using, an, electrolytic, process, at, low, concentrations, 0, 06, mol, l, deep, blue, solutions, are, formed, these, contain, metal, cations, and, solvated, electrons, free, electrons, that, are, surrounded, by, a, cage, of, ammonia, molecules, these, solutions, are, strong, reducing, agents, at, higher, concentrations, the, solutions, are, metallic, in, appearance, and, in, electrical, conductivity, at, low, temperatures, the, two, types, of, solution, can, coexist, as, immiscible, phases, the, range, of, thermodynamic, stability, of, liquid, ammonia, solutions, is, very, narrow, as, the, potential, for, oxidation, to, dinitrogen, e, n, 2, 6, 6, e, 8, nh, 3, is, only, 0, 04, v, in, practice, both, oxidation, to, dinitrogen, and, reduction, to, dihydrogen, are, slow, this, is, particularly, true, of, reducing, solutions, the, solutions, of, the, alkali, metals, mentioned, above, are, stable, for, several, days, slowly, decomposing, to, the, metal, amide, and, dihydrogen, most, studies, involving, liquid, ammonia, solutions, are, done, in, reducing, conditions, although, oxidation, of, liquid, ammonia, is, usually, slow, there, is, still, a, risk, of, explosion, particularly, if, transition, metal, ions, are, present, as, possible, catalysts, the, ammonia, molecule, has, a, trigonal, pyramidal, shape, as, predicted, by, the, valence, shell, electron, pair, repulsion, theory, vsepr, theory, with, an, experimentally, determined, bond, angle, of, 106, 7, the, central, nitrogen, atom, has, five, outer, electrons, with, an, additional, electron, from, each, hydrogen, atom, this, gives, a, total, of, eight, electrons, or, four, electron, pairs, that, are, arranged, tetrahedrally, three, of, these, electron, pairs, are, used, as, bond, pairs, which, leaves, one, lone, pair, of, electrons, the, lone, pair, repels, more, strongly, than, bond, pairs, therefore, the, bond, angle, is, not, 109, 5, as, expected, for, a, regular, tetrahedral, arrangement, but, 106, 8, this, shape, gives, the, molecule, a, dipole, moment, and, makes, it, polar, the, molecule, s, polarity, and, especially, its, ability, to, form, hydrogen, bonds, makes, ammonia, highly, miscible, with, water, the, lone, pair, makes, ammonia, a, base, a, proton, acceptor, ammonia, is, moderately, basic, a, 1, 0, m, aqueous, solution, has, a, ph, of, 11, 6, and, if, a, strong, acid, is, added, to, such, a, solution, until, the, solution, is, neutral, ph, 7, 99, 4, of, the, ammonia, molecules, are, protonated, temperature, and, salinity, also, affect, the, proportion, of, ammonium, the, latter, has, the, shape, of, a, regular, tetrahedron, and, is, isoelectronic, with, methane, the, ammonia, molecule, readily, undergoes, nitrogen, inversion, at, room, temperature, a, useful, analogy, is, an, umbrella, turning, itself, inside, out, in, a, strong, wind, the, energy, barrier, to, this, inversion, is, 24, 7, kj, mol, and, the, resonance, frequency, is, 23, 79, ghz, corresponding, to, microwave, radiation, of, a, wavelength, of, 1, 260, cm, the, absorption, at, this, frequency, was, the, first, microwave, spectrum, to, be, observed, and, was, used, in, the, first, maser, one, of, the, most, characteristic, properties, of, ammonia, is, its, basicity, ammonia, is, considered, to, be, a, weak, base, it, combines, with, acids, to, form, ammonium, salts, thus, with, hydrochloric, acid, it, forms, ammonium, chloride, sal, ammoniac, with, nitric, acid, ammonium, nitrate, etc, perfectly, dry, ammonia, gas, will, not, combine, with, perfectly, dry, hydrogen, chloride, gas, moisture, is, necessary, to, bring, about, the, reaction, as, a, demonstration, experiment, under, air, with, ambient, moisture, opened, bottles, of, concentrated, ammonia, and, hydrochloric, acid, solutions, produce, a, cloud, of, ammonium, chloride, which, seems, to, appear, out, of, nothing, as, the, salt, aerosol, forms, where, the, two, diffusing, clouds, of, reagents, meet, between, the, two, bottles, the, salts, produced, by, the, action, of, ammonia, on, acids, are, known, as, the, ammonium, salts, and, all, contain, the, ammonium, ion, although, ammonia, is, well, known, as, a, weak, base, it, can, also, act, as, an, extremely, weak, acid, it, is, a, protic, substance, and, is, capable, of, formation, of, amides, which, contain, the, nh, 2, ion, for, example, lithium, dissolves, in, liquid, ammonia, to, give, a, blue, solution, solvated, electron, of, lithium, amide, like, water, liquid, ammonia, undergoes, molecular, autoionisation, to, form, its, acid, and, base, conjugates, ammonia, often, functions, as, a, weak, base, so, it, has, some, buffering, ability, shifts, in, ph, will, cause, more, or, fewer, ammonium, cations, nh, 4, and, amide, anions, nh, 2, to, be, present, in, solution, at, standard, pressure, and, temperature, ammonia, does, not, burn, readily, or, sustain, combustion, except, under, narrow, fuel, to, air, mixtures, of, 15, 28, ammonia, by, volume, in, air, when, mixed, with, oxygen, it, burns, with, a, pale, yellowish, green, flame, ignition, occurs, when, chlorine, is, passed, into, ammonia, forming, nitrogen, and, hydrogen, chloride, if, chlorine, is, present, in, excess, then, the, highly, explosive, nitrogen, trichloride, ncl, 3, is, also, formed, the, combustion, of, ammonia, to, form, nitrogen, and, water, is, exothermic, the, standard, enthalpy, change, of, combustion, h, c, expressed, per, mole, of, ammonia, and, with, condensation, of, the, water, formed, is, 382, 81, kj, mol, dinitrogen, is, the, thermodynamic, product, of, combustion, all, nitrogen, oxides, are, unstable, with, respect, to, n, 2, and, o, 2, which, is, the, principle, behind, the, catalytic, converter, nitrogen, oxides, can, be, formed, as, kinetic, products, in, the, presence, of, appropriate, catalysts, a, reaction, of, great, industrial, importance, in, the, production, of, nitric, acid, a, subsequent, reaction, leads, to, no, 2, the, combustion, of, ammonia, in, air, is, very, difficult, in, the, absence, of, a, catalyst, such, as, platinum, gauze, or, warm, chromium, iii, oxide, due, to, the, relatively, low, heat, of, combustion, a, lower, laminar, burning, velocity, high, auto, ignition, temperature, high, heat, of, vapourization, and, a, narrow, flammability, range, however, recent, studies, have, shown, that, efficient, and, stable, combustion, of, ammonia, can, be, achieved, using, swirl, combustors, thereby, rekindling, research, interest, in, ammonia, as, a, fuel, for, thermal, power, production, the, flammable, range, of, ammonia, in, dry, air, is, 15, 15, 27, 35, and, in, 100, relative, humidity, air, is, 15, 95, 26, 55, for, studying, the, kinetics, of, ammonia, combustion, knowledge, of, a, detailed, reliable, reaction, mechanism, is, required, but, this, has, been, challenging, to, obtain, ammonia, is, a, direct, or, indirect, precursor, to, most, manufactured, nitrogen, containing, compounds, it, is, the, precursor, to, nitric, acid, which, is, the, source, for, most, n, substituted, aromatic, compounds, amines, can, be, formed, by, the, reaction, of, ammonia, with, alkyl, halides, or, more, commonly, with, alcohols, its, ring, opening, reaction, with, ethylene, oxide, give, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, and, triethanolamine, amides, can, be, prepared, by, the, reaction, of, ammonia, with, carboxylic, acid, and, their, derivatives, for, example, ammonia, reacts, with, formic, acid, hcooh, to, yield, formamide, hconh, 2, when, heated, acyl, chlorides, are, the, most, reactive, but, the, ammonia, must, be, present, in, at, least, a, twofold, excess, to, neutralise, the, hydrogen, chloride, formed, esters, and, anhydrides, also, react, with, ammonia, to, form, amides, ammonium, salts, of, carboxylic, acids, can, be, dehydrated, to, amides, by, heating, to, 150, 200, c, as, long, as, no, thermally, sensitive, groups, are, present, other, organonitrogen, compounds, include, alprazolam, ethanolamine, ethyl, carbamate, and, hexamethylenetetramine, nitric, acid, is, generated, via, the, ostwald, process, by, oxidation, of, ammonia, with, air, over, a, platinum, catalyst, at, 700, 850, c, 1, 292, 1, 562, f, 9, atm, nitric, oxide, and, nitrogen, dioxide, are, intermediate, in, this, conversion, nitric, acid, is, used, for, the, production, of, fertilisers, explosives, and, many, organonitrogen, compounds, the, hydrogen, in, ammonia, is, susceptible, to, replacement, by, a, myriad, substituents, ammonia, gas, reacts, with, metallic, sodium, to, give, sodamide, nanh, 2, with, chlorine, monochloramine, is, formed, pentavalent, ammonia, is, known, as, 5, amine, nitrogen, pentahydride, decomposes, spontaneously, into, trivalent, ammonia, 3, amine, and, hydrogen, gas, at, normal, conditions, this, substance, was, once, investigated, as, a, possible, solid, rocket, fuel, in, 1966, ammonia, is, also, used, to, make, the, following, compounds, ammonia, is, a, ligand, forming, metal, ammine, complexes, for, historical, reasons, ammonia, is, named, ammine, in, the, nomenclature, of, coordination, compounds, one, notable, ammine, complex, is, cisplatin, pt, nh, 3, 2, cl, 2, a, widely, used, anticancer, drug, ammine, complexes, of, chromium, iii, formed, the, basis, of, alfred, werner, s, revolutionary, theory, on, the, structure, of, coordination, compounds, werner, noted, only, two, isomers, fac, and, mer, of, the, complex, could, be, formed, and, concluded, the, ligands, must, be, arranged, around, the, metal, ion, at, the, vertices, of, an, octahedron, ammonia, forms, 1, 1, adducts, with, a, variety, of, lewis, acids, such, as, i, 2, phenol, and, al, ch, 3, 3, ammonia, is, a, hard, base, hsab, theory, and, its, e, c, parameters, are, e, b, 2, 31, and, c, b, 2, 04, its, relative, donor, strength, toward, a, series, of, acids, versus, other, lewis, bases, can, be, illustrated, by, c, b, plots, ammonia, and, ammonium, salts, can, be, readily, detected, in, very, minute, traces, by, the, addition, of, nessler, s, solution, which, gives, a, distinct, yellow, colouration, in, the, presence, of, the, slightest, trace, of, ammonia, or, ammonium, salts, the, amount, of, ammonia, in, ammonium, salts, can, be, estimated, quantitatively, by, distillation, of, the, salts, with, sodium, naoh, or, potassium, hydroxide, koh, the, ammonia, evolved, being, absorbed, in, a, known, volume, of, standard, sulfuric, acid, and, the, excess, of, acid, then, determined, volumetrically, or, the, ammonia, may, be, absorbed, in, hydrochloric, acid, and, the, ammonium, chloride, so, formed, precipitated, as, ammonium, hexachloroplatinate, 2, sulfur, sticks, are, burnt, to, detect, small, leaks, in, industrial, ammonia, refrigeration, systems, larger, quantities, can, be, detected, by, warming, the, salts, with, a, caustic, alkali, or, with, quicklime, when, the, characteristic, smell, of, ammonia, will, be, at, once, apparent, ammonia, is, an, irritant, and, irritation, increases, with, concentration, the, permissible, exposure, limit, is, 25, ppm, and, lethal, above, 500, ppm, by, volume, higher, concentrations, are, hardly, detected, by, conventional, detectors, the, type,

ions, derived, naturally, from, ammonia, and, returned, to, ammonia, via, organic, processes, in, water, or, waste, liquids, it, is, a, measure, used, mainly, for, quantifying, values, in, waste, treatment, and, water, purification, systems, as, well, as, a, measure, of, the, health, of, natural, and, man, made, water, reserves, it, is, measured, in, units, of, mg, l, milligram, per, litre, the, ancient, greek, historian, herodotus, mentioned, that, there, were, outcrops, of, salt, in, an, area, of, libya, that, was, inhabited, by, a, people, called, the, ammonians, now, the, siwa, oasis, in, northwestern, egypt, where, salt, lakes, still, exist, the, greek, geographer, strabo, also, mentioned, the, salt, from, this, region, however, the, ancient, authors, dioscorides, apicius, arrian, synesius, and, a, tius, of, amida, described, this, salt, as, forming, clear, crystals, that, could, be, used, for, cooking, and, that, were, essentially, rock, salt, hammoniacus, sal, appears, in, the, writings, of, pliny, although, it, is, not, known, whether, the, term, is, equivalent, to, the, more, modern, sal, ammoniac, ammonium, chloride, the, fermentation, of, urine, by, bacteria, produces, a, solution, of, ammonia, hence, fermented, urine, was, used, in, classical, antiquity, to, wash, cloth, and, clothing, to, remove, hair, from, hides, in, preparation, for, tanning, to, serve, as, a, mordant, in, dying, cloth, and, to, remove, rust, from, iron, it, was, also, used, by, ancient, dentists, to, wash, teeth, in, the, form, of, sal, ammoniac, nushadir, ammonia, was, important, to, the, muslim, alchemists, it, was, mentioned, in, the, book, of, stones, likely, written, in, the, 9th, century, and, attributed, to, j, bir, ibn, hayy, n, it, was, also, important, to, the, european, alchemists, of, the, 13th, century, being, mentioned, by, albertus, magnus, it, was, also, used, by, dyers, in, the, middle, ages, in, the, form, of, fermented, urine, to, alter, the, colour, of, vegetable, dyes, in, the, 15th, century, basilius, valentinus, showed, that, ammonia, could, be, obtained, by, the, action, of, alkalis, on, sal, ammoniac, at, a, later, period, when, sal, ammoniac, was, obtained, by, distilling, the, hooves, and, horns, of, oxen, and, neutralizing, the, resulting, carbonate, with, hydrochloric, acid, the, name, spirit, of, hartshorn, was, applied, to, ammonia, gaseous, ammonia, was, first, isolated, by, joseph, black, in, 1756, by, reacting, sal, ammoniac, ammonium, chloride, with, calcined, magnesia, magnesium, oxide, it, was, isolated, again, by, peter, woulfe, in, 1767, by, carl, wilhelm, scheele, in, 1770, and, by, joseph, priestley, in, 1773, and, was, termed, by, him, alkaline, air, eleven, years, later, in, 1785, claude, louis, berthollet, ascertained, its, composition, the, production, of, ammonia, from, nitrogen, in, the, air, and, hydrogen, was, invented, by, fritz, haber, and, robert, lerossignol, the, patent, was, sent, in, 1909, uspto, nr, 1, 202, 995, and, awarded, in, 1916, later, carl, bosch, developed, the, industrial, method, for, ammonia, production, haber, bosch, process, it, was, first, used, on, an, industrial, scale, in, germany, during, world, war, i, following, the, allied, blockade, that, cut, off, the, supply, of, nitrates, from, chile, the, ammonia, was, used, to, produce, explosives, to, sustain, war, efforts, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, 1918, was, awarded, to, fritz, haber, for, the, synthesis, of, ammonia, from, its, elements, before, the, availability, of, natural, gas, hydrogen, as, a, precursor, to, ammonia, production, was, produced, via, the, electrolysis, of, water, or, using, the, chloralkali, process, with, the, advent, of, the, steel, industry, in, the, 20th, century, ammonia, became, a, byproduct, of, the, production, of, coking, coal, in, the, us, as, of, 2019, approximately, 88, of, ammonia, was, used, as, fertilisers, either, as, its, salts, solutions, or, anhydrously, when, applied, to, soil, it, helps, provide, increased, yields, of, crops, such, as, maize, and, wheat, 30, of, agricultural, nitrogen, applied, in, the, us, is, in, the, form, of, anhydrous, ammonia, and, worldwide, 110, million, tonnes, are, applied, each, year, solutions, of, ammonia, ranging, from, 16, to, 25, are, used, in, the, fermentation, industry, as, a, source, of, nitrogen, for, microorganisms, and, to, adjust, ph, during, fermentation, because, of, ammonia, s, vapourization, properties, it, is, a, useful, refrigerant, it, was, commonly, used, before, the, popularisation, of, chlorofluorocarbons, freons, anhydrous, ammonia, is, widely, used, in, industrial, refrigeration, applications, and, hockey, rinks, because, of, its, high, energy, efficiency, and, low, cost, it, suffers, from, the, disadvantage, of, toxicity, and, requiring, corrosion, resistant, components, which, restricts, its, domestic, and, small, scale, use, along, with, its, use, in, modern, vapour, compression, refrigeration, it, is, used, in, a, mixture, along, with, hydrogen, and, water, in, absorption, refrigerators, the, kalina, cycle, which, is, of, growing, importance, to, geothermal, power, plants, depends, on, the, wide, boiling, range, of, the, ammonia, water, mixture, ammonia, coolant, is, also, used, in, the, radiators, aboard, the, international, space, station, in, loops, that, are, used, to, regulate, the, internal, temperature, and, enable, temperature, dependent, experiments, the, ammonia, is, under, sufficient, pressure, to, remain, liquid, throughout, the, process, single, phase, ammonia, cooling, systems, also, serve, the, power, electronics, in, each, pair, of, solar, arrays, the, potential, importance, of, ammonia, as, a, refrigerant, has, increased, with, the, discovery, that, vented, cfcs, and, hfcs, are, potent, and, stable, greenhouse, gases, as, early, as, in, 1895, it, was, known, that, ammonia, was, strongly, antiseptic, it, requires, 1, 4, grams, per, litre, to, preserve, beef, tea, broth, in, one, study, anhydrous, ammonia, destroyed, 99, 999, of, zoonotic, bacteria, in, three, types, of, animal, feed, but, not, silage, anhydrous, ammonia, is, currently, used, commercially, to, reduce, or, eliminate, microbial, contamination, of, beef, lean, finely, textured, beef, popularly, known, as, pink, slime, in, the, beef, industry, is, made, from, fatty, beef, trimmings, c, 50, 70, fat, by, removing, the, fat, using, heat, and, centrifugation, then, treating, it, with, ammonia, to, kill, e, coli, the, process, was, deemed, effective, and, safe, by, the, us, department, of, agriculture, based, on, a, study, that, found, that, the, treatment, reduces, e, coli, to, undetectable, levels, there, have, been, safety, concerns, about, the, process, as, well, as, consumer, complaints, about, the, taste, and, smell, of, ammonia, treated, beef, ammonia, has, been, used, as, fuel, and, is, a, proposed,

detectors, that, have, been, used, to, identify, ammonia, the, study, of, interstellar, ammonia, has, been, important, to, a, number, of, areas, of, research, in, the, last, few, decades, some, of, these, are, delineated, below, and, primarily, involve, using, ammonia, as, an, interstellar, thermometer, the, interstellar, abundance, for, ammonia, has, been, measured, for, a, variety, of, environments, the, ratio, has, been, estimated, to, range, from, 10, 7, in, small, dark, clouds, up, to, 10, 5, in, the, dense, core, of, the, orion, molecular, cloud, complex, although, a, total, of, 18, total, production, routes, have, been, proposed, the, principal, formation, mechanism, for, interstellar, nh, 3, is, the, reaction, the, rate, constant, k, of, this, reaction, depends, on, the, temperature, of, the, environment, with, a, value, of, 5, 2, 10, 6, displaystyle, 5, 2, times, 10, 6, at, 10, k, the, rate, constant, was, calculated, from, the, formula, k, a, t, 300, b, displaystyle, k, a, t, 300, b, for, the, primary, formation, reaction, a, 1, 05, 10, 6, and, b, 0, 47, assuming, an, nh, 4, abundance, of, 3, 10, 7, displaystyle, 3, times, 10, 7, and, an, electron, abundance, of, 10, 7, typical, of, molecular, clouds, the, formation, will, proceed, at, a, rate, of, 1, 6, 10, 9, cm, 3, s, 1, in, a, molecular, cloud, of, total, density, 10, 5, cm, 3, all, other, proposed, formation, reactions, have, rate, constants, of, between, two, and, 13, orders, of, magnitude, smaller, making, their, contribution, to, the, abundance, of, ammonia, relatively, insignificant, as, an, example, of, the, minor, contribution, other, formation, reactions, play, the, reaction, has, a, rate, constant, of, 2, 2, 10, 15, assuming, h, 2, densities, of, 10, 5, and, ratio, of, 10, 7, this, reaction, proceeds, at, a, rate, of, 2, 2, 10, 12, more, than, three, orders, of, magnitude, slower, than, the, primary, reaction, above, some, of, the, other, possible, formation, reactions, are, there, are, 113, total, proposed, reactions, leading, to, the, destruction, of, nh, 3, of, these, 39, were, tabulated, in, extensive, tables, of, the, chemistry, among, c, n, and, o, compounds, a, review, of, interstellar, ammonia, cites, the, following, reactions, as, the, principal, dissociation, mechanisms, with, rate, constants, of, 4, 39, 10, 9, and, 2, 2, 10, 9, respectively, the, above, equations, 1, 2, run, at, a, rate, of, 8, 8, 10, 9, and, 4, 4, 10, 13, respectively, these, calculations, assumed, the, given, rate, constants, and, abundances, of, 10, 5, 2, 10, 5, 2, 10, 9, and, total, densities, of, n, 10, 5, typical, of, cold, dense, molecular, clouds, clearly, between, these, two, primary, reactions, equation, 1, is, the, dominant, destruction, reaction, with, a, rate, 10, 000, times, faster, than, equation, 2, this, is, due, to, the, relatively, high, abundance, of, radio, observations, of, nh, 3, from, the, effelsberg, 100, m, radio, telescope, reveal, that, the, ammonia, line, is, separated, into, two, components, a, background, ridge, and, an, unresolved, core, the, background, corresponds, well, with, the, locations, previously, detected, co, the, 25, m, chilbolton, telescope, in, england, detected, radio, signatures, of, ammonia, in, h, ii, regions, hnh, 2, o, masers, h, h, objects, and, other, objects, associated, with, star, formation, a, comparison, of, emission, line, widths, indicates, that, turbulent, or, systematic, velocities, do, not, increase, in, the, central, cores, of, molecular, clouds, microwave, radiation, from, ammonia, was, observed, in, several, galactic, objects, including, w3, oh, orion, a, w43, w51, and, five, sources, in, the, galactic, centre, the, high, detection, rate, indicates, that, this, is, a, common, molecule, in, the, interstellar, medium, and, that, high, density, regions, are, common, in, the, galaxy, vla, observations, of, nh, 3, in, seven, regions, with, high, velocity, gaseous, outflows, revealed, condensations, of, less, than, 0, 1, pc, in, l1551, s140, and, cepheus, a, three, individual, condensations, were, detected, in, cepheus, a, one, of, them, with, a, highly, elongated, shape, they, may, play, an, important, role, in, creating, the, bipolar, outflow, in, the, region, extragalactic, ammonia, was, imaged, using, the, vla, in, ic, 342, the, hot, gas, has, temperatures, above, 70, k, which, was, inferred, from, ammonia, line, ratios, and, appears, to, be, closely, associated, with, the, innermost, portions, of, the, nuclear, bar, seen, in, co, nh, 3, was, also, monitored, by, vla, toward, a, sample, of, four, galactic, ultracompact, hii, regions, g9, 62, 0, 19, g10, 47, 0, 03, g29, 96, 0, 02, and, g31, 41, 0, 31, based, upon, temperature, and, density, diagnostics, it, is, concluded, that, in, general, such, clumps, are, probably, the, sites, of, massive, star, formation, in, an, early, evolutionary, phase, prior, to, the, development, of, an, ultracompact, hii, region, absorption, at, 2, 97, micrometres, due, to, solid, ammonia, was, recorded, from, interstellar, grains, in, the, becklin, neugebauer, object, and, probably, in, ngc, 2264, ir, as, well, this, detection, helped, explain, the, physical, shape, of, previously, poorly, understood, and, related, ice, absorption, lines, a, spectrum, of, the, disk, of, jupiter, was, obtained, from, the, kuiper, airborne, observatory, covering, the, 100, to, 300, cm, 1, spectral, range, analysis, of, the, spectrum, provides, information, on, global, mean, properties, of, ammonia, gas, and, an, ammonia, ice, haze, a, total, of, 149, dark, cloud, positions, were, surveyed, for, evidence, of, dense, cores, by, using, the, j, k, 1, 1, rotating, inversion, line, of, nh, 3, in, general, the, cores, are, not, spherically, shaped, with, aspect, ratios, ranging, from, 1, 1, to, 4, 4, it, is, also, found, that, cores, with, stars, have, broader, lines, than, cores, without, stars, ammonia, has, been, detected, in, the, draco, nebula, and, in, one, or, possibly, two, molecular, clouds, which, are, associated, with, the, high, latitude, galactic, infrared, cirrus, the, finding, is, significant, because, they, may, represent, the, birthplaces, for, the, population, i, metallicity, b, type, stars, in, the, galactic, halo, that, could, have, been, borne, in, the, galactic, disk, by, balancing, and, stimulated, emission, with, spontaneous, emission, it, is, possible, to, construct, a, relation, between, excitation, temperature, and, density, moreover, since, the, transitional, levels, of, ammonia, can, be, approximated, by, a, 2, level, system, at, low, temperatures, this, calculation, is, fairly, simple, this, premise, can, be, applied, to, dark, clouds, regions, suspected, of, having, extremely, low, temperatures, and, possible, sites, for, future, star, formation, detections, of, ammonia, in, dark, clouds, show, very, narrow, lines, indicative, not, only, of, low, temperatures, but, also, of, a, low, level, of, inner, cloud, turbulence, line, ratio, calculations, provide, a, measurement, of, cloud, temperature, that, is, independent, of, previous, co, observations, the, ammonia, observations, were, consistent, with, co, measurements, of, rotation, temperatures, of, 10, k, with, this, densities, can, be, determined, and, have, been, calculated, to, range, between, 10, 4, and, 10, 5, cm, 3, in, dark, clouds, mapping, of, nh, 3, gives, typical, clouds, sizes, of, 0, 1, pc, and, masses, near, 1, solar, mass, these, cold, dense, cores, are, the, sites, of, future, star, formation, ultra, compact, hii, regions, are, among, the, best, tracers, of, high, mass, star, formation, the, dense, material, surrounding, uchii, regions, is, likely, primarily, molecular, since, a, complete, study, of, massive, star, formation, necessarily, involves, the, cloud, from, which, the, star, formed, ammonia, is, an, invaluable, tool, in, understanding, this, surrounding, molecular, material, since, this, molecular, material, can, be, spatially, resolved, it, is, possible, to, constrain, the, heating, ionising, sources, temperatures, masses, and, sizes, of, the, regions, doppler, shifted, velocity, components, allow, for, the, separation, of, distinct, regions, of, molecular, gas, that, can, trace, outflows, and, hot, cores, originating, from, forming, stars, ammonia, has, been, detected, in, external, galaxies, and, by, simultaneously, measuring, several, lines, it, is, possible, to, directly, measure, the, gas, temperature, in, these, galaxies, line, ratios, imply, that, gas, temperatures, are, warm, 50, k, originating, from, dense, clouds, with, sizes, of, tens, of, parsecs, this, picture, is, consistent, with, the, picture, within, our, milky, way, galaxy, hot, dense, molecular, cores, form, around, newly, forming, stars, embedded, in, larger, clouds, of, molecular, material, on, the, scale, of, several, hundred, parsecs, giant, molecular, clouds, gmcs
