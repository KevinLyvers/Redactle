u, 1, 2, k, x, 2, elastic, u, 1, 2, c, v, 2, electric, u, m, b, magnetic, in, physics, potential, energy, is, the, energy, held, by, an, object, because, of, its, position, relative, to, other, objects, stresses, within, itself, its, electric, charge, or, other, factors, the, term, potential, energy, was, introduced, by, the, 19th, century, scottish, engineer, and, physicist, william, rankine, although, it, has, links, to, the, ancient, greek, philosopher, aristotle, s, concept, of, potentiality, common, types, of, potential, energy, include, the, gravitational, potential, energy, of, an, object, the, elastic, potential, energy, of, a, deformed, spring, and, the, electric, potential, energy, of, an, electric, charge, in, an, electric, field, the, unit, for, energy, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, is, the, joule, symbol, j, potential, energy, is, associated, with, forces, that, act, on, a, body, in, a, way, that, the, total, work, done, by, these, forces, on, the, body, depends, only, on, the, initial, and, final, positions, of, the, body, in, space, these, forces, whose, total, work, is, path, independent, are, called, conservative, forces, if, the, force, acting, on, a, body, varies, over, space, then, one, has, a, force, field, such, a, field, is, described, by, vectors, at, every, point, in, space, which, is, in, turn, called, a, vector, field, a, conservative, vector, field, can, be, simply, expressed, as, the, gradient, of, a, certain, scalar, function, called, a, scalar, potential, the, potential, energy, is, related, to, and, can, be, obtained, from, this, potential, function, there, are, various, types, of, potential, energy, each, associated, with, a, particular, type, of, force, for, example, the, work, of, an, elastic, force, is, called, elastic, potential, energy, work, of, the, gravitational, force, is, called, gravitational, potential, energy, work, of, the, coulomb, force, is, called, electric, potential, energy, work, of, the, strong, nuclear, force, or, weak, nuclear, force, acting, on, the, baryon, charge, is, called, nuclear, potential, energy, work, of, intermolecular, forces, is, called, intermolecular, potential, energy, chemical, potential, energy, such, as, the, energy, stored, in, fossil, fuels, is, the, work, of, the, coulomb, force, during, rearrangement, of, configurations, of, electrons, and, nuclei, in, atoms, and, molecules, thermal, energy, usually, has, two, components, the, kinetic, energy, of, random, motions, of, particles, and, the, potential, energy, of, their, configuration, forces, derivable, from, a, potential, are, also, called, conservative, forces, the, work, done, by, a, conservative, force, is, w, u, displaystyle, w, delta, u, where, u, displaystyle, delta, u, is, the, change, in, the, potential, energy, associated, with, the, force, the, negative, sign, provides, the, convention, that, work, done, against, a, force, field, increases, potential, energy, while, work, done, by, the, force, field, decreases, potential, energy, common, notations, for, potential, energy, are, pe, u, v, and, e, p, potential, energy, is, the, energy, by, virtue, of, an, object, s, position, relative, to, other, objects, potential, energy, is, often, associated, with, restoring, forces, such, as, a, spring, or, the, force, of, gravity, the, action, of, stretching, a, spring, or, lifting, a, mass, is, performed, by, an, external, force, that, works, against, the, force, field, of, the, potential, this, work, is, stored, in, the, force, field, which, is, said, to, be, stored, as, potential, energy, if, the, external, force, is, removed, the, force, field, acts, on, the, body, to, perform, the, work, as, it, moves, the, body, back, to, the, initial, position, reducing, the, stretch, of, the, spring, or, causing, a, body, to, fall, consider, a, ball, whose, mass, is, m, and, whose, height, is, h, the, acceleration, g, of, free, fall, is, approximately, constant, so, the, weight, force, of, the, ball, mg, is, constant, the, product, of, force, and, displacement, gives, the, work, done, which, is, equal, to, the, gravitational, potential, energy, thus, u, g, m, g, h, displaystyle, u, g, mgh, the, more, formal, definition, is, that, potential, energy, is, the, energy, difference, between, the, energy, of, an, object, in, a, given, position, and, its, energy, at, a, reference, position, from, around, 1840, scientists, sought, to, define, and, understand, energy, and, work, the, term, potential, energy, was, coined, by, william, rankine, a, scottish, engineer, and, physicist, in, 1853, as, part, of, a, specific, effort, to, develop, terminology, he, chose, the, term, as, part, of, the, pair, actual, vs, potential, going, back, to, work, by, aristotle, in, his, 1867, discussion, of, the, same, topic, rankine, describes, potential, energy, as, energy, of, configuration, in, contrast, to, actual, energy, as, energy, of, activity, also, in, 1867, william, thomson, introduced, kinetic, energy, as, the, opposite, of, potential, energy, asserting, that, all, actual, energy, took, the, form, of, 1, 2, mv, 2, once, this, hypothesis, became, widely, accepted, the, term, actual, energy, gradually, faded, potential, energy, is, closely, linked, with, forces, if, the, work, done, by, a, force, on, a, body, that, moves, from, a, to, b, does, not, depend, on, the, path, between, these, points, if, the, work, is, done, by, a, conservative, force, then, the, work, of, this, force, measured, from, a, assigns, a, scalar, value, to, every, other, point, in, space, and, defines, a, scalar, potential, field, in, this, case, the, force, can, be, defined, as, the, negative, of, the, vector, gradient, of, the, potential, field, if, the, work, for, an, applied, force, is, independent, of, the, path, then, the, work, done, by, the, force, is, evaluated, from, the, start, to, the, end, of, the, trajectory, of, the, point, of, application, this, means, that, there, is, a, function, u, x, called, a, potential, that, can, be, evaluated, at, the, two, points, x, a, and, x, b, to, obtain, the, work, over, any, trajectory, between, these, two, points, it, is, tradition, to, define, this, function, with, a, negative, sign, so, that, positive, work, is, a, reduction, in, the, potential, that, is, w, c, f, d, x, u, x, a, u, x, b, displaystyle, w, int, c, mathbf, f, cdot, d, mathbf, x, u, mathbf, x, text, a, u, mathbf, x, text, b, where, c, is, the, trajectory, taken, from, a, to, b, because, the, work, done, is, independent, of, the, path, taken, then, this, expression, is, true, for, any, trajectory, c, from, a, to, b, the, function, u, x, is, called, the, potential, energy, associated, with, the, applied, force, examples, of, forces, that, have, potential, energies, are, gravity, and, spring, forces, in, this, section, the, relationship, between, work, and, potential, energy, is, presented, in, more, detail, the, line, integral, that, defines, work, along, curve, c, takes, a, special, form, if, the, force, f, is, related, to, a, scalar, field, u, x, so, that, f, u, u, x, u, y, u, z, displaystyle, mathbf, f, nabla, u, left, frac, partial, u, partial, x, frac, partial, u, partial, y, frac, partial, u, partial, z, right, this, means, that, the, units, of, u, must,

evaluated, using, the, gradient, theorem, to, obtain, w, u, x, b, u, x, a, displaystyle, w, u, mathbf, x, text, b, u, mathbf, x, text, a, this, shows, that, when, forces, are, derivable, from, a, scalar, field, the, work, of, those, forces, along, a, curve, c, is, computed, by, evaluating, the, scalar, field, at, the, start, point, a, and, the, end, point, b, of, the, curve, this, means, the, work, integral, does, not, depend, on, the, path, between, a, and, b, and, is, said, to, be, independent, of, the, path, potential, energy, u, u, x, is, traditionally, defined, as, the, negative, of, this, scalar, field, so, that, work, by, the, force, field, decreases, potential, energy, that, is, w, u, x, a, u, x, b, displaystyle, w, u, mathbf, x, text, a, u, mathbf, x, text, b, in, this, case, the, application, of, the, del, operator, to, the, work, function, yields, w, u, u, x, u, y, u, z, f, displaystyle, nabla, w, nabla, u, left, frac, partial, u, partial, x, frac, partial, u, partial, y, frac, partial, u, partial, z, right, mathbf, f, and, the, force, f, is, said, to, be, derivable, from, a, potential, this, also, necessarily, implies, that, f, must, be, a, conservative, vector, field, the, potential, u, defines, a, force, f, at, every, point, x, in, space, so, the, set, of, forces, is, called, a, force, field, given, a, force, field, f, x, evaluation, of, the, work, integral, using, the, gradient, theorem, can, be, used, to, find, the, scalar, function, associated, with, potential, energy, this, is, done, by, introducing, a, parameterized, curve, t, r, t, from, a, a, to, b, b, and, computing, r, d, r, a, b, r, t, r, t, d, t, a, b, d, d, t, r, t, d, t, r, b, r, a, x, b, x, a, displaystyle, begin, aligned, int, gamma, nabla, phi, mathbf, r, cdot, d, mathbf, r,

such, as, with, the, distances, between, all, bodies, tending, to, infinity, provided, that, the, energy, involved, in, tending, to, that, limit, is, finite, such, as, in, the, case, of, inverse, square, law, forces, any, arbitrary, reference, state, could, be, used, therefore, it, can, be, chosen, based, on, convenience, typically, the, potential, energy, of, a, system, depends, on, the, relative, positions, of, its, components, only, so, the, reference, state, can, also, be, expressed, in, terms, of, relative, positions, gravitational, energy, is, the, potential, energy, associated, with, gravitational, force, as, work, is, required, to, elevate, objects, against, earth, s, gravity, the, potential, energy, due, to, elevated, positions, is, called, gravitational, potential, energy, and, is, evidenced, by, water, in, an, elevated, reservoir, or, kept, behind, a, dam, if, an, object, falls, from, one, point, to, another, point, inside, a, gravitational, field, the, force, of, gravity, will, do, positive, work, on, the, object, and, the, gravitational, potential, energy, will, decrease, by, the, same, amount, consider, a, book, placed, on, top, of, a, table, as, the, book, is, raised, from, the, floor, to, the, table, some, external, force, works, against, the, gravitational, force, if, the, book, falls, back, to, the, floor, the, falling, energy, the, book, receives, is, provided, by, the, gravitational, force, thus, if, the, book, falls, off, the, table, this, potential, energy, goes, to, accelerate, the, mass, of, the, book, and, is, converted, into, kinetic, energy, when, the, book, hits, the, floor, this, kinetic, energy, is, converted, into, heat, deformation, and, sound, by, the, impact, the, factors, that, affect, an, object, s, gravitational, potential, energy, are, its, height, relative, to, some, reference, point, its, mass, and, the, strength, of, the, gravitational, field, it, is, in, thus, a, book, lying, on, a, table, has, less, gravitational, potential, energy, than, the, same, book, on, top, of, a, taller, cupboard, and, less, gravitational, potential, energy, than, a, heavier, book, lying, on, the, same, table, an, object, at, a, certain, height, above, the, moon, s, surface, has, less, gravitational, potential, energy, than, at, the, same, height, above, the, earth, s, surface, because, the, moon, s, gravity, is, weaker, height, in, the, common, sense, of, the, term, cannot, be, used, for, gravitational, potential, energy, calculations, when, gravity, is, not, assumed, to, be, a, constant, the, following, sections, provide, more, detail, the, strength, of, a, gravitational, field, varies, with, location, however, when, the, change, of, distance, is, small, in, relation, to, the, distances, from, the, center, of, the, source, of, the, gravitational, field, this, variation, in, field, strength, is, negligible, and, we, can, assume, that, the, force, of, gravity, on, a, particular, object, is, constant, near, the, surface, of, the, earth, for, example, we, assume, that, the, acceleration, due, to, gravity, is, a, constant, g, 9, 8, m, s, 2, standard, gravity, in, this, case, a, simple, expression, for, gravitational, potential, energy, can, be, derived, using, the, w, fd, equation, for, work, and, the, equation, w, f, u, f, displaystyle, w, f, delta, u, f, the, amount, of, gravitational, potential, energy, held, by, an, elevated, object, is, equal, to, the, work, done, against, gravity, in, lifting, it, the, work, done, equals, the, force, required, to, move, it, upward, multiplied, with, the, vertical, distance, it, is, moved, remember, w, fd, the, upward, force, required, while, moving, at, a, constant, velocity, is, equal, to, the, weight, mg, of, an, object, so, the, work, done, in, lifting, it, through, a, height, h, is, the, product, mgh, thus, when, accounting, only, for, mass, gravity, and, altitude, the, equation, is, u, m, g, h, displaystyle, u, mgh, where, u, is, the, potential, energy, of, the, object, relative, to, its, being, on, the, earth, s, surface, m, is, the, mass, of, the, object, g, is, the, acceleration, due, to, gravity, and, h, is, the, altitude, of, the, object, hence, the, potential, difference, is, u, m, g, h, displaystyle, delta, u, mg, delta, h, however, over, large, variations, in, distance, the, approximation, that, g, is, constant, is, no, longer, valid, and, we, have, to, use, calculus, and, the, general, mathematical, definition, of, work, to, determine, gravitational, potential, energy, for, the, computation, of, the, potential, energy, we, can, integrate, the, gravitational, force, whose, magnitude, is, given, by, newton, s, law, of, gravitation, with, respect, to, the, distance, r, between, the, two, bodies, using, that, definition, the, gravitational, potential, energy, of, a, system, of, masses, m, 1, and, m, 2, at, a, distance, r, using, the, newtonian, constant, of, gravitation, g, is, u, g, m, 1, m, 2, r, k, displaystyle, u, g, frac, m, 1, m, 2, r, k, where, k, is, an, arbitrary, constant, dependent, on, the, choice, of, datum, from, which, potential, is, measured, choosing, the, convention, that, k, 0, i, e, in, relation, to, a, point, at, infinity, makes, calculations, simpler, albeit, at, the, cost, of, making, u, negative, for, why, this, is, physically, reasonable, see, below, given, this, formula, for, u, the, total, potential, energy, of, a, system, of, n, bodies, is, found, by, summing, for, all, n, n, 1, 2, textstyle, frac, n, n, 1, 2, pairs, of, two, bodies, the, potential, energy, of, the, system, of, those, two, bodies, considering, the, system, of, bodies, as, the, combined, set, of, small, particles, the, bodies, consist, of, and, applying, the, previous, on, the, particle, level, we, get, the, negative, gravitational, binding, energy, this, potential, energy, is, more, strongly, negative, than, the, total, potential, energy, of, the, system, of, bodies, as, such, since, it, also, includes, the, negative, gravitational, binding, energy, of, each, body, the, potential, energy, of, the, system, of, bodies, as, such, is, the, negative, of, the, energy, needed, to, separate, the, bodies, from, each, other, to, infinity, while, the, gravitational, binding, energy, is, the, energy, needed, to, separate, all, particles, from, each, other, to, infinity, u, m, g, m, 1, r, 1, g, m, 2, r, 2, displaystyle, u, m, left, g, frac, m, 1, r, 1, g, frac, m, 2, r, 2, right, therefore, u, m, g, m, r, displaystyle, u, m, sum, g, frac, m, r, as, with, all, potential, energies, only, differences, in, gravitational, potential, energy, matter, for, most, physical, purposes, and, the, choice, of, zero, point, is, arbitrary, given, that, there, is, no, reasonable, criterion, for, preferring, one, particular, finite, r, over, another, there, seem, to, be, only, two, reasonable, choices, for, the, distance, at, which, u, becomes, zero, r, 0, displaystyle, r, 0, and, r, displaystyle, r, infty, the, choice, of, u, 0, displaystyle, u, 0, at, infinity, may, seem, peculiar, and, the, consequence, that, gravitational, energy, is, always, negative, may, seem, counterintuitive, but, this, choice, allows, gravitational, potential, energy, values, to, be, finite, albeit, negative, the, singularity, at, r, 0, displaystyle, r, 0, in, the, formula, for, gravitational, potential, energy, means, that, the, only, other, apparently, reasonable, alternative, choice, of, convention, with, u, 0, displaystyle, u, 0, for, r, 0, displaystyle, r, 0, would, result, in, potential, energy, being, positive, but, infinitely, large, for, all, nonzero, values, of, r, and, would, make, calculations, involving, sums, or, differences, of, potential, energies, beyond, what, is, possible, with, the, real, number, system, since, physicists, abhor, infinities, in, their, calculations, and, r, is, always, non, zero, in, practice, the, choice, of, u, 0, displaystyle, u, 0, at, infinity, is, by, far, the, more, preferable, choice, even, if, the, idea, of, negative, energy, in, a, gravity, well, appears, to, be, peculiar, at, first, the, negative, value, for, gravitational, energy, also, has, deeper, implications, that, make, it, seem, more, reasonable, in, cosmological, calculations, where, the, total, energy, of, the, universe, can, meaningfully, be, considered, see, inflation, theory, for, more, on, this, gravitational, potential, energy, has, a, number, of, practical, uses, notably, the, generation, of, pumped, storage, hydroelectricity, for, example, in, dinorwig, wales, there, are, two, lakes, one, at, a, higher, elevation, than, the, other, at, times, when, surplus, electricity, is, not, required, and, so, is, comparatively, cheap, water, is, pumped, up, to, the, higher, lake, thus, converting, the, electrical, energy, running, the, pump, to, gravitational, potential, energy, at, times, of, peak, demand, for, electricity, the, water, flows, back, down, through, electrical, generator, turbines, converting, the, potential, energy, into, kinetic, energy, and, then, back, into, electricity, the, process, is, not, completely, efficient, and, some, of, the, original, energy, from, the, surplus, electricity, is, in, fact, lost, to, friction, gravitational, potential, energy, is, also, used, to, power, clocks, in, which, falling, weights, operate, the, mechanism, it, is, also, used, by, counterweights, for, lifting, up, an, elevator, crane, or, sash, window, roller, coasters, are, an, entertaining, way, to, utilize, potential, energy, chains, are, used, to, move, a, car, up, an, incline, building, up, gravitational, potential, energy, to, then, have, that, energy, converted, into, kinetic, energy, as, it, falls, another, practical, use, is, utilizing, gravitational, potential, energy, to, descend, perhaps, coast, downhill, in, transportation, such, as, the, descent, of, an, automobile, truck, railroad, train, bicycle, airplane, or, fluid, in, a, pipeline, in, some, cases, the, kinetic, energy, obtained, from, the, potential, energy, of, descent, may, be, used, to, start, ascending, the, next, grade, such, as, what, happens, when, a, road, is, undulating, and, has, frequent, dips, the, commercialization, of, stored, energy, in, the, form, of, rail, cars, raised, to, higher, elevations, that, is, then, converted, to, electrical, energy, when, needed, by, an, electrical, grid, is, being, undertaken, in, the, united, states, in, a, system, called, advanced, rail, energy, storage, ares, chemical, potential, energy, is, a, form, of, potential, energy, related, to, the, structural, arrangement, of, atoms, or, molecules, this, arrangement, may, be, the, result, of, chemical, bonds, within, a, molecule, or, otherwise, chemical, energy, of, a, chemical, substance, can, be, transformed, to, other, forms, of, energy, by, a, chemical, reaction, as, an, example, when, a, fuel, is, burned, the, chemical, energy, is, converted, to, heat, same, is, the, case, with, digestion, of, food, metabolized, in, a, biological, organism, green, plants, transform, solar, energy, to, chemical, energy, through, the, process, known, as, photosynthesis, and, electrical, energy, can, be, converted, to, chemical, energy, through, electrochemical, reactions, the, similar, term, chemical, potential, is, used, to, indicate, the, potential, of, a, substance, to, undergo, a, change, of, configuration, be, it, in, the, form, of, a, chemical, reaction, spatial, transport, particle, exchange, with, a, reservoir, etc, an, object, can, have, potential, energy, by, virtue, of, its, electric, charge, and, several, forces, related, to, their, presence, there, are, two, main, types, of, this, kind, of, potential, energy, electrostatic, potential, energy, electrodynamic, potential, energy, also, sometimes, called, magnetic, potential, energy, electrostatic, potential, energy, between, two, bodies, in, space, is, obtained, from, the, force, exerted, by, a, charge, q, on, another, charge, q, which, is, given, by, f, e, 1, 4, 0, q, q, r, 2, r, displaystyle, mathbf, f, e, frac, 1, 4, pi, varepsilon, 0, frac, qq, r, 2, mathbf, hat, r, where, r, displaystyle, mathbf, hat, r, is, a, vector, of, length, 1, pointing, from, q, to, q, and, 0, is, the, vacuum, permittivity, if, the, electric, charge, of, an, object, can, be, assumed, to, be, at, rest, then, it, has, potential, energy, due, to, its, position, relative, to, other, charged, objects, the, electrostatic, potential, energy, is, the, energy, of, an, electrically, charged, particle, at, rest, in, an, electric, field, it, is, defined, as, the, work, that, must, be, done, to, move, it, from, an, infinite, distance, away, to, its, present, location, adjusted, for, non, electrical, forces, on, the, object, this, energy, will, generally, be, non, zero, if, there, is, another, electrically, charged, object, nearby, the, work, w, required, to, move, q, from, a, to, any, point, b, in, the, electrostatic, force, field, is, given, by, u, a, b, r, a, b, f, e, d, r, displaystyle, delta, u, ab, mathbf, r, int, a, b, mathbf, f, e, cdot, d, mathbf, r, typically, given, in, j, for, joules, a, related, quantity, called, electric, potential, commonly, denoted, with, a, v, for, voltage, is, equal, to, the, electric, potential, energy, per, unit, charge, the, energy, of, a, magnetic, moment, displaystyle, boldsymbol, mu, in, an, externally, produced, magnetic, b, field, b, has, potential, energy, u, b, displaystyle, u, boldsymbol, mu, cdot, mathbf, b, the, magnetization, m, in, a, field, is, u, 1, 2, m, b, d, v, displaystyle, u, frac, 1, 2, int, mathbf, m, cdot, mathbf, b, dv, where, the, integral, can, be, over, all, space, or, equivalently, where, m, is, nonzero, magnetic, potential, energy, is, the, form, of, energy, related, not, only, to, the, distance, between, magnetic, materials, but, also, to, the, orientation, or, alignment, of, those, materials, within, the, field, for, example, the, needle, of, a, compass, has, the, lowest, magnetic, potential, energy, when, it, is, aligned, with, the, north, and, south, poles, of, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, if, the, needle, is, moved, by, an, outside, force, torque, is, exerted, on, the, magnetic, dipole, of, the, needle, by, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, causing, it, to, move, back, into, alignment, the, magnetic, potential, energy, of, the, needle, is, highest, when, its, field, is, in, the, same, direction, as, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, two, magnets, will, have, potential, energy, in, relation, to, each, other, and, the, distance, between, them, but, this, also, depends, on, their, orientation, if, the, opposite, poles, are, held, apart, the, potential, energy, will, be, higher, the, further, they, are, apart, and, lower, the, closer, they, are, conversely, like, poles, will, have, the, highest, potential, energy, when, forced, together, and, the, lowest, when, they, spring, apart, nuclear, potential, energy, is, the, potential, energy, of, the, particles, inside, an, atomic, nucleus, the, nuclear, particles, are, bound, together, by, the, strong, nuclear, force, weak, nuclear, forces, provide, the, potential, energy, for, certain, kinds, of, radioactive, decay, such, as, beta, decay, nuclear, particles, like, protons, and, neutrons, are, not, destroyed, in, fission, and, fusion, processes, but, collections, of, them, can, have, less, mass, than, if, they, were, individually, free, in, which, case, this, mass, difference, can, be, liberated, as, heat, and, radiation, in, nuclear, reactions, the, heat, and, radiation, have, the, missing, mass, but, it, often, escapes, from, the, system, where, it, is, not, measured, the, energy, from, the, sun, is, an, example, of, this, form, of, energy, conversion, in, the, sun, the, process, of, hydrogen, fusion, converts, about, 4, million, tonnes, of, solar, matter, per, second, into, electromagnetic, energy, which, is, radiated, into, space, potential, energy, is, closely, linked, with, forces, if, the, work, done, by, a, force, on, a, body, that, moves, from, a, to, b, does, not, depend, on, the, path, between, these, points, then, the, work, of, this, force, measured, from, a, assigns, a, scalar, value, to, every, other, point, in, space, and, defines, a, scalar, potential, field, in, this, case, the, force, can, be, defined, as, the, negative, of, the, vector, gradient, of, the, potential, field, for, example, gravity, is, a, conservative, force, the, associated, potential, is, the, gravitational, potential, often, denoted, by, displaystyle, phi, or, v, displaystyle, v, corresponding, to, the, energy, per, unit, mass, as, a, function, of, position, the, gravitational, potential, energy, of, two, particles, of, mass, m, and, m, separated, by, a, distance, r, is, u, g, m, m, r, displaystyle, u, frac, gmm, r, the, gravitational, potential, specific, energy, of, the, two, bodies, is, g, m, r, g, m, r, g, m, m, r, g, m, m, r, u, displaystyle, phi, left, frac, gm, r, frac, gm, r, right, frac, g, m, m, r, frac, gmm, mu, r, frac, u, mu, where, displaystyle, mu, is, the, reduced, mass, the, work, done, against, gravity, by, moving, an, infinitesimal, mass, from, point, a, with, u, a, displaystyle, u, a, to, point, b, with, u, b, displaystyle, u, b, is, b, a, displaystyle, b, a, and, the, work, done, going, back, the, other, way, is, a, b, displaystyle, a, b, so, that, the, total, work, done, in, moving, from, a, to, b, and, returning, to, a, is, u, a, b, a, b, a, a, b, 0, displaystyle, u, a, to, b, to, a, b, a, a, b, 0, if, the, potential, is, redefined, at, a, to, be, a, c, displaystyle, a, c, and, the, potential, at, b, to, be, b, c, displaystyle, b, c, where, c, displaystyle, c, is, a, constant, i, e, c, displaystyle, c, can, be, any, number, positive, or, negative, but, it, must, be, the, same, at, a, as, it, is, at, b, then, the, work, done, going, from, a, to, b, is, u, a, b, b, c, a, c, b, a, displaystyle, u, a, to, b, b, c, a, c, b, a, as, before, in, practical, terms, this, means, that, one, can, set, the, zero, of, u, displaystyle, u, and, displaystyle, phi, anywhere, one, likes, one, may, set, it, to, be, zero, at, the, surface, of, the, earth, or, may, find, it, more, convenient, to, set, zero, at, infinity, as, in, the, expressions, given, earlier, in, this, section, a, conservative, force, can, be, expressed, in, the, language, of, differential, geometry, as, a, closed, form, as, euclidean, space, is, contractible, its, de, rham, cohomology, vanishes, so, every, closed, form, is, also, an, exact, form, and, can, be, expressed, as, the, gradient, of, a, scalar, field, this, gives, a, mathematical, justification, of, the, fact, that, all, conservative, forces, are, gradients, of, a, potential, field
