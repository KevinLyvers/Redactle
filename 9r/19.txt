united, states, customary, units, form, a, system, of, measurement, units, commonly, used, in, the, united, states, and, most, u, s, territories, since, being, standardized, and, adopted, in, 1832, the, united, states, customary, system, developed, from, english, units, that, were, in, use, in, the, british, empire, before, the, u, s, became, an, independent, country, the, united, kingdom, s, system, of, measures, was, overhauled, in, 1824, to, create, the, imperial, system, with, imperial, units, which, was, officially, adopted, in, 1826, changing, the, definitions, of, some, of, its, units, consequently, while, many, u, s, units, are, essentially, similar, to, their, imperial, counterparts, there, are, noticeable, differences, between, the, systems, the, majority, of, u, s, customary, units, were, redefined, in, terms, of, the, meter, and, kilogram, with, the, mendenhall, order, of, 1893, and, in, practice, for, many, years, before, these, definitions, were, refined, by, the, international, yard, and, pound, agreement, of, 1959, the, united, states, uses, customary, units, in, commercial, activities, as, well, as, for, personal, and, social, use, in, science, medicine, many, sectors, of, industry, and, some, government, and, military, areas, metric, units, are, used, the, international, system, of, units, si, the, modern, form, of, the, metric, system, is, preferred, for, many, uses, by, the, u, s, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, nist, for, newer, types, of, measurement, where, there, is, no, traditional, customary, unit, international, units, are, used, sometimes, mixed, with, customary, units, for, example, electrical, resistance, of, wire, expressed, in, ohms, si, per, thousand, feet, the, united, states, system, of, units, of, 1832, is, based, on, the, system, in, use, in, britain, prior, to, the, introduction, to, the, british, imperial, system, on, january, 1, 1826, both, systems, are, derived, from, english, units, a, system, which, had, evolved, over, the, millennia, before, american, independence, and, which, had, its, roots, in, both, roman, and, anglo, saxon, units, the, customary, system, was, championed, by, the, u, s, based, international, institute, for, preserving, and, perfecting, weights, and, measures, in, the, late, 19th, century, some, advocates, of, the, customary, system, saw, the, french, revolutionary, or, metric, system, as, atheistic, the, president, of, an, ohio, auxiliary, of, the, institute, wrote, that, the, traditional, units, were, a, just, weight, and, a, just, measure, which, alone, are, acceptable, to, the, lord, his, organization, later, went, so, far, as, to, publish, music, for, a, song, proclaiming, down, with, every, metric, scheme, the, u, s, government, passed, the, metric, conversion, act, of, 1975, which, made, the, metric, system, the, preferred, system, of, weights, and, measures, for, u, s, trade, and, commerce, the, legislation, states, that, the, federal, government, has, a, responsibility, to, assist, industry, as, it, voluntarily, converts, to, the, metric, system, i, e, metrification, this, is, most, evident, in, u, s, labeling, requirements, on, food, products, where, si, units, are, almost, always, presented, alongside, customary, units, according, to, the, cia, world, factbook, the, united, states, is, one, of, three, nations, along, with, liberia, and, myanmar, burma, that, have, not, adopted, the, metric, system, as, their, official, system, of, weights, and, measures, executive, order, 12770, signed, by, president, george, h, w, bush, on, july, 25, 1991, citing, the, metric, conversion, act, directed, departments, and, agencies, within, the, executive, branch, of, the, united, states, government, to, take, all, appropriate, measures, within, their, authority, to, use, the, metric, system, as, the, preferred, system, of, weights, and, measures, for, united, states, trade, and, commerce, and, authorized, the, secretary, of, commerce, to, charter, an, interagency, council, on, metric, policy, icmp, which, will, assist, the, secretary, in, coordinating, federal, government, wide, implementation, of, this, order, u, s, customary, units, are, widely, used, on, consumer, products, and, in, industrial, manufacturing, metric, units, are, standard, in, science, medicine, as, well, as, many, sectors, of, industry, and, government, including, the, military, there, are, anecdotal, objections, to, the, use, of, metric, units, in, carpentry, and, the, building, trades, on, the, basis, that, it, is, easier, to, remember, an, integer, number, of, inches, plus, a, fraction, than, a, measurement, in, millimeters, or, that, foot, inch, measurements, are, more, suitable, when, distances, are, frequently, divided, into, halves, thirds, and, quarters, often, in, parallel, the, metric, system, also, lacks, a, parallel, measurement, to, the, foot, the, term, united, states, customary, units, was, used, by, the, former, united, states, national, bureau, of, standards, although, english, units, is, sometimes, used, in, colloquial, speech, for, measuring, length, the, u, s, customary, system, uses, the, inch, foot, yard, and, mile, which, are, the, only, four, customary, length, measurements, in, everyday, use, from, 1893, the, foot, was, legally, defined, as, exactly, 1200, 3937, m, approximately, 0, 304, 8006, m, since, july, 1, 1959, the, units, of, length, have, been, defined, on, the, basis, of, 1, yd, 0, 9144, m, the, u, s, the, united, kingdom, and, other, commonwealth, countries, agreed, on, this, definition, per, the, international, yard, and, pound, agreement, of, 1958, at, the, time, of, the, agreement, the, basic, geodetic, datum, in, north, america, was, the, north, american, datum, of, 1927, nad27, which, had, been, constructed, by, triangulation, based, on, the, definition, of, the, foot, in, the, mendenhall, order, of, 1893, that, is, 1, ft, 1200, 3937, m, this, definition, was, retained, for, data, derived, from, nad27, but, renamed, the, us, survey, foot, to, distinguish, it, from, the, international, foot, for, most, applications, the, difference, between, the, two, definitions, is, insignificant, one, international, foot, is, exactly, 0, 999, 998, of, a, us, survey, foot, for, a, difference, of, about, 1, 8, in, 3, mm, per, mile, but, it, affects, the, definition, of, the, state, plane, coordinate, systems, spcss, which, can, stretch, over, hundreds, of, miles, the, nad27, was, replaced, in, the, 1980s, by, the, north, american, datum, of, 1983, nad83, which, is, defined, in, meters, the, spcss, were, also, updated, but, the, u, s, national, geodetic, survey, left, the, decision, of, which, if, any, definition, of, the, foot, to, use, to, the, individual, states, and, other, jurisdictions, all, spcs, 1983, systems, are, defined, in, meters, but, forty, jurisdictions, also, use, the, survey, foot, six, use, the, international, foot, and, ten, do, not, specify, which, if, any, foot, type, should, be, used, in, 2019, the, nist, working, with, the, national, geodetic, survey, ngs, national, ocean, service, nos, national, oceanic, and, atmospheric, administration, noaa, and, department, of, commerce, doc, issued, a, federal, register, notice, frn, indicating, the, deprecation, of, the, u, s, survey, foot, and, u, s, survey, mile, units, from, december, 31, 2022, in, the, following, tables, in, this, and, subsequent, sections, the, most, common, measures, are, shown, in, italics, and, approximate, values, are, shown, in, parentheses, values, not, in, parentheses, are, exact, note, that, as, announced, by, the, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, the, us, survey, foot, and, other, units, defined, in, terms, of, it, have, been, deprecated, since, 2023, except, for, historic, and, legacy, applications, the, most, widely, used, area, unit, with, a, name, unrelated, to, any, length, unit, is, the, acre, the, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, formerly, contended, that, customary, area, units, are, defined, in, terms, of, the, square, survey, foot, not, the, square, international, foot, but, from, 2023, it, states, that, although, historically, defined, using, the, u, s, survey, foot, the, statute, mile, can, be, defined, using, either, definition, of, the, foot, as, is, the, case, for, all, other, units, listed, in, this, table, however, use, of, definitions, based, on, the, u, s, survey, foot, should, be, avoided, after, december, 31, 2022, except, for, historic, and, legacy, applications, the, cubic, inch, cubic, foot, and, cubic, yard, are, commonly, used, for, measuring, volume, in, addition, there, is, one, group, of, units, for, measuring, volumes, of, liquids, based, on, the, wine, gallon, and, subdivisions, of, the, fluid, ounce, and, one, for, measuring, volumes, of, dry, material, each, with, their, own, names, and, sub, units, although, the, units, and, their, names, are, similar, to, the, units, in, the, imperial, system, and, many, units, are, shared, between, the, two, systems, as, a, whole, with, respect, to, volume, however, this, is, quite, the, contrary, the, independence, of, the, u, s, from, the, british, empire, decades, prior, to, the, reformation, of, units, in, 1824, most, notably, the, gallon, its, subdivisions, and, in, mass, higher, combinations, above, the, pound, is, the, cause, of, the, differences, in, values, as, a, non, participant, in, that, reform, the, u, s, retained, the, separate, systems, for, measuring, the, volumes, of, liquids, and, dry, material, whereas, the, imperial, system, had, unified, the, units, for, both, under, a, new, imperial, gallon, the, u, s, uses, the, pre, 1824, gallon, 231, cubic, inches, 3, 790, cm, 3, and, winchester, bushel, 2, 150, 42, cubic, inches, 35, 239, 1, cm, 3, as, opposed, to, british, 1824, definition, of, 1, imperial, gallon, 4, 5, l, 1, 2, us, gal, 10, lb, 4, 5, kg, of, water, and, the, bushel, as, 8, imperial, gallons, 36, l, 9, 6, us, gal, one, us, fluid, ounce, is, 1, 16, of, a, us, pint, 1, 32, of, a, us, quart, and, 1, 128, of, a, us, gallon, the, teaspoon, tablespoon, and, cup, are, defined, in, terms, of, a, fluid, ounce, as, 1, 6, 1, 2, and, 8, fluid, ounces, respectively, the, fluid, ounce, derives, its, name, originally, from, being, the, volume, of, one, ounce, avoirdupois, of, water, but, in, the, us, it, is, defined, as, 1, 128, of, a, us, gallon, consequently, a, fluid, ounce, of, water, weighs, about, 1, 041, ounces, avoirdupois, for, nutritional, labeling, and, medicine, in, the, us, the, teaspoon, and, tablespoon, are, defined, as, a, metric, teaspoon, and, tablespoon, precisely, 5, ml, and, 15, ml, respectively, the, saying, a, pint, s, a, pound, the, world, around, refers, to, 16, us, fluid, ounces, of, water, weighing, approximately, about, 4, more, than, one, pound, avoirdupois, an, imperial, pint, of, water, weighs, a, pound, and, a, quarter, 20, oz, there, are, varying, standards, for, barrel, for, some, specific, commodities, including, 31, gallons, for, beer, 40, gallons, for, whiskey, or, kerosene, and, 42, gallons, for, petroleum, the, general, standard, for, liquids, is, 31, 5, gal, or, half, a, hogshead, the, common, 55, gallon, size, of, drum, for, storing, and, transporting, various, products, and, wastes, is, sometimes, confused, with, a, barrel, though, it, is, not, a, standard, measure, in, the, u, s, single, servings, of, beverages, are, usually, measured, in, fluid, ounces, milk, is, usually, sold, in, half, pints, 8, fluid, ounces, pints, quarts, half, gallons, and, gallons, water, volume, for, sinks, bathtubs, ponds, swimming, pools, etc, is, usually, stated, in, gallons, or, cubic, feet, quantities, of, gases, are, usually, given, in, cubic, feet, at, one, atmosphere, minims, drams, gill, and, pottle, are, rarely, used, currently, the, gill, is, often, referred, to, as, a, half, cup, the, pottle, is, often, referred, to, as, a, half, gallon, dry, volume, is, measured, on, a, separate, system, although, many, of, the, names, remain, the, same, small, fruits, and, vegetables, are, often, sold, in, dry, pints, and, dry, quarts, the, us, dry, gallon, is, less, commonly, used, and, was, not, included, in, the, handbook, that, many, states, recognize, as, the, authority, on, measurement, law, however, pecks, or, bushels, are, sometimes, used, particularly, for, grapes, apples, and, similar, fruits, in, agricultural, regions, there, have, historically, been, five, different, english, systems, of, mass, tower, apothecaries, troy, avoirdupois, and, metric, of, these, the, avoirdupois, weight, is, the, most, common, system, used, in, the, u, s, although, troy, weight, is, still, used, to, weigh, precious, metals, apothecaries, weight, once, used, by, pharmacies, has, been, largely, replaced, by, metric, measurements, tower, weight, fell, out, of, use, in, england, due, to, legal, prohibition, in, 1527, centuries, ago, and, was, never, used, in, the, u, s, the, imperial, system, which, is, still, used, for, some, measures, in, the, united, kingdom, and, other, countries, is, based, on, avoirdupois, with, variations, from, u, s, customary, units, larger, than, a, pound, the, pound, avoirdupois, which, forms, the, basis, of, the, u, s, customary, system, of, mass, is, defined, as, exactly, 453, 59237, grams, by, agreement, between, the, u, s, the, united, kingdom, and, other, english, speaking, countries, in, 1959, other, units, of, mass, are, defined, in, terms, of, it, the, avoirdupois, pound, is, legally, defined, as, a, measure, of, mass, but, the, name, pound, is, also, applied, to, measures, of, force, for, instance, in, many, contexts, the, pound, avoirdupois, is, used, as, a, unit, of, mass, but, in, some, contexts, the, term, pound, is, used, to, refer, to, pound, force, the, slug, is, another, unit, of, mass, derived, from, pound, force, troy, weight, avoirdupois, weight, and, apothecaries, weight, are, all, built, from, the, same, basic, unit, the, grain, which, is, the, same, in, all, three, systems, however, while, each, system, has, some, overlap, in, the, names, of, their, units, of, measure, all, have, ounces, and, pounds, the, relationship, between, the, grain, and, these, other, units, within, each, system, varies, for, example, in, apothecary, and, troy, weight, the, pound, and, ounce, are, the, same, but, are, different, from, the, pound, and, ounce, in, avoirdupois, in, terms, of, their, relationships, to, grains, and, to, each, other, the, systems, also, have, different, units, between, the, grain, and, ounce, apothecaries, has, scruple, and, dram, troy, has, pennyweight, and, avoirdupois, has, just, dram, sometimes, spelled, drachm, the, dram, in, avoirdupois, weighs, just, under, half, of, the, dram, in, apothecaries, the, fluid, dram, unit, of, volume, is, based, on, the, weight, of, 1, dram, of, water, in, the, apothecaries, system, to, alleviate, confusion, it, is, typical, when, publishing, non, avoirdupois, weights, to, mention, the, name, of, the, system, along, with, the, unit, precious, metals, for, example, are, often, weighed, in, troy, ounces, because, just, ounce, would, be, more, likely, to, be, assumed, to, mean, an, avoirdupois, ounce, for, the, pound, and, smaller, units, the, u, s, customary, system, and, the, british, imperial, system, are, identical, however, they, differ, when, dealing, with, units, larger, than, the, pound, the, definition, of, the, pound, avoirdupois, in, the, imperial, system, is, identical, to, that, in, the, u, s, customary, system, in, the, u, s, only, the, ounce, pound, and, short, ton, known, in, the, country, simply, as, the, ton, are, commonly, used, though, the, hundredweight, is, still, used, in, agriculture, and, shipping, the, grain, is, used, to, describe, the, mass, of, propellant, and, projectiles, in, small, arms, ammunition, it, was, also, used, to, measure, medicine, and, other, very, small, masses, in, agricultural, practice, a, bushel, is, a, fixed, volume, of, 2, 150, 42, cubic, inches, 35, 2391, liters, the, mass, of, grain, will, therefore, vary, according, to, density, some, nominal, weight, examples, are, the, most, common, practical, cooking, measures, for, both, liquid, and, dry, ingredients, in, the, u, s, are, teaspoon, tablespoon, and, cup, along, with, halves, thirds, quarters, and, eighths, of, each, units, used, are, pounds, ounces, and, fluid, ounces, common, sizes, are, also, used, such, as, can, presumed, size, varies, depending, on, product, jar, square, e, g, of, chocolate, stick, e, g, of, butter, or, portion, of, fruit, or, vegetable, e, g, a, half, lemon, two, medium, onions, degrees, fahrenheit, are, used, in, the, u, s, to, measure, temperatures, in, most, non, scientific, contexts, the, rankine, scale, of, absolute, temperature, also, saw, some, use, in, thermodynamics, scientists, worldwide, use, the, kelvin, and, degree, celsius, several, u, s, technical, standards, are, expressed, in, fahrenheit, temperatures, and, some, american, medical, practitioners, use, degrees, fahrenheit, for, body, temperature, the, relationship, between, the, different, temperature, scales, is, linear, but, the, scales, have, different, zero, points, so, conversion, is, not, simply, multiplication, by, a, factor, pure, water, freezes, at, 32, f, 0, c, and, boils, at, 212, f, 100, c, at, 1, atm, the, conversion, formula, is, t, f, 9, 5, t, c, 32, displaystyle, t, mathrm, circ, f, tfrac, 9, 5, t, mathrm, circ, c, 32, or, inversely, as, t, c, 5, 9, t, f,

common, use, these, are, straightforwardly, defined, based, on, the, above, basic, units, sizing, systems, are, used, for, various, items, in, commerce, several, of, which, are, u, s, specific, the, united, states, code, refers, to, these, units, as, traditional, systems, of, weights, and, measures, other, common, ways, of, referring, to, the, system, are, customary, standard, english, or, imperial, which, refers, to, the, post, 1824, reform, measures, used, throughout, the, british, empire, commonwealth, countries, another, term, is, the, foot, pound, second, fps, system, as, opposed, to, centimeter, gram, second, cgs, and, meter, kilogram, second, mks, systems, tools, and, fasteners, with, sizes, measured, in, inches, are, sometimes, called, sae, bolts, or, sae, wrenches, to, differentiate, them, from, their, metric, counterparts, the, society, of, automotive, engineers, sae, originally, developed, fasteners, standards, using, u, s, units, for, the, u, s, auto, industry, the, organization, now, uses, metric, units
