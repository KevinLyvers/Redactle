a, comet, is, an, icy, small, solar, system, body, that, warms, and, begins, to, release, gases, when, passing, close, to, the, sun, a, process, called, outgassing, this, produces, an, extended, gravitationally, unbound, atmosphere, or, coma, surrounding, the, nucleus, and, sometimes, a, tail, of, gas, and, dust, gas, blown, out, from, the, coma, these, phenomena, are, due, to, the, effects, of, solar, radiation, and, the, outstreaming, solar, wind, plasma, acting, upon, the, nucleus, of, the, comet, comet, nuclei, range, from, a, few, hundred, meters, to, tens, of, kilometers, across, and, are, composed, of, loose, collections, of, ice, dust, and, small, rocky, particles, the, coma, may, be, up, to, 15, times, earth, s, diameter, while, the, tail, may, stretch, beyond, one, astronomical, unit, if, sufficiently, close, and, bright, a, comet, may, be, seen, from, earth, without, the, aid, of, a, telescope, and, can, subtend, an, arc, of, up, to, 30, 60, moons, across, the, sky, comets, have, been, observed, and, recorded, since, ancient, times, by, many, cultures, and, religions, comets, usually, have, highly, eccentric, elliptical, orbits, and, they, have, a, wide, range, of, orbital, periods, ranging, from, several, years, to, potentially, several, millions, of, years, short, period, comets, originate, in, the, kuiper, belt, or, its, associated, scattered, disc, which, lie, beyond, the, orbit, of, neptune, long, period, comets, are, thought, to, originate, in, the, oort, cloud, a, spherical, cloud, of, icy, bodies, extending, from, outside, the, kuiper, belt, to, halfway, to, the, nearest, star, long, period, comets, are, set, in, motion, towards, the, sun, by, gravitational, perturbations, from, passing, stars, and, the, galactic, tide, hyperbolic, comets, may, pass, once, through, the, inner, solar, system, before, being, flung, to, interstellar, space, the, appearance, of, a, comet, is, called, an, apparition, extinct, comets, that, have, passed, close, to, the, sun, many, times, have, lost, nearly, all, of, their, volatile, ices, and, dust, and, may, come, to, resemble, small, asteroids, asteroids, are, thought, to, have, a, different, origin, from, comets, having, formed, inside, the, orbit, of, jupiter, rather, than, in, the, outer, solar, system, however, the, discovery, of, main, belt, comets, and, active, centaur, minor, planets, has, blurred, the, distinction, between, asteroids, and, comets, in, the, early, 21st, century, the, discovery, of, some, minor, bodies, with, long, period, comet, orbits, but, characteristics, of, inner, solar, system, asteroids, were, called, manx, comets, they, are, still, classified, as, comets, such, as, c, 2014, s3, panstarrs, twenty, seven, manx, comets, were, found, from, 2013, to, 2017, as, of, november, 2021, there, are, 4, 584, known, comets, however, this, represents, a, very, small, fraction, of, the, total, potential, comet, population, as, the, reservoir, of, comet, like, bodies, in, the, outer, solar, system, in, the, oort, cloud, is, about, one, trillion, roughly, one, comet, per, year, is, visible, to, the, naked, eye, though, many, of, those, are, faint, and, unspectacular, particularly, bright, examples, are, called, great, comets, comets, have, been, visited, by, uncrewed, probes, such, as, nasa, s, deep, impact, which, blasted, a, crater, on, comet, tempel, 1, to, study, its, interior, and, the, european, space, agency, s, rosetta, which, became, the, first, to, land, a, robotic, spacecraft, on, a, comet, the, word, comet, derives, from, the, old, english, cometa, from, the, latin, com, ta, or, com, t, s, that, in, turn, is, a, romanization, of, the, greek, wearing, long, hair, and, the, oxford, english, dictionary, notes, that, the, term, already, meant, long, haired, star, comet, in, greek, was, derived, from, koman, to, wear, the, hair, long, which, was, itself, derived, from, kom, the, hair, of, the, head, and, was, used, to, mean, the, tail, of, a, comet, the, astronomical, symbol, for, comets, represented, in, unicode, is, u, 2604, comet, consisting, of, a, small, disc, with, three, hairlike, extensions, the, solid, core, structure, of, a, comet, is, known, as, the, nucleus, cometary, nuclei, are, composed, of, an, amalgamation, of, rock, dust, water, ice, and, frozen, carbon, dioxide, carbon, monoxide, methane, and, ammonia, as, such, they, are, popularly, described, as, dirty, snowballs, after, fred, whipple, s, model, comets, with, a, higher, dust, content, have, been, called, icy, dirtballs, the, term, icy, dirtballs, arose, after, observation, of, comet, 9p, tempel, 1, collision, with, an, impactor, probe, sent, by, nasa, deep, impact, mission, in, july, 2005, research, conducted, in, 2014, suggests, that, comets, are, like, deep, fried, ice, cream, in, that, their, surfaces, are, formed, of, dense, crystalline, ice, mixed, with, organic, compounds, while, the, interior, ice, is, colder, and, less, dense, the, surface, of, the, nucleus, is, generally, dry, dusty, or, rocky, suggesting, that, the, ices, are, hidden, beneath, a, surface, crust, several, metres, thick, the, nuclei, contains, a, variety, of, organic, compounds, which, may, include, methanol, hydrogen, cyanide, formaldehyde, ethanol, ethane, and, perhaps, more, complex, molecules, such, as, long, chain, hydrocarbons, and, amino, acids, in, 2009, it, was, confirmed, that, the, amino, acid, glycine, had, been, found, in, the, comet, dust, recovered, by, nasa, s, stardust, mission, in, august, 2011, a, report, based, on, nasa, studies, of, meteorites, found, on, earth, was, published, suggesting, dna, and, rna, components, adenine, guanine, and, related, organic, molecules, may, have, been, formed, on, asteroids, and, comets, the, outer, surfaces, of, cometary, nuclei, have, a, very, low, albedo, making, them, among, the, least, reflective, objects, found, in, the, solar, system, the, giotto, space, probe, found, that, the, nucleus, of, halley, s, comet, 1p, halley, reflects, about, four, percent, of, the, light, that, falls, on, it, and, deep, space, 1, discovered, that, comet, borrelly, s, surface, reflects, less, than, 3, 0, by, comparison, asphalt, reflects, seven, percent, the, dark, surface, material, of, the, nucleus, may, consist, of, complex, organic, compounds, solar, heating, drives, off, lighter, volatile, compounds, leaving, behind, larger, organic, compounds, that, tend, to, be, very, dark, like, tar, or, crude, oil, the, low, reflectivity, of, cometary, surfaces, causes, them, to, absorb, the, heat, that, drives, their, outgassing, processes, comet, nuclei, with, radii, of, up, to, 30, kilometers, 19, mi, have, been, observed, but, ascertaining, their, exact, size, is, difficult, the, nucleus, of, 322p, soho, is, probably, only, 100, 200, meters, 330, 660, ft, in, diameter, a, lack, of, smaller, comets, being, detected, despite, the, increased, sensitivity, of, instruments, has, led, some, to, suggest, that, there, is, a, real, lack, of, comets, smaller, than, 100, meters, 330, ft, across, known, comets, have, been, estimated, to, have, an, average, density, of, 0, 6, g, cm, 3, 0, 35, oz, cu, in, because, of, their, low, mass, comet, nuclei, do, not, become, spherical, under, their, own, gravity, and, therefore, have, irregular, shapes, roughly, six, percent, of, the, near, earth, asteroids, are, thought, to, be, the, extinct, nuclei, of, comets, that, no, longer, experience, outgassing, including, 14827, hypnos, and, 3552, don, quixote, results, from, the, rosetta, and, philae, spacecraft, show, that, the, nucleus, of, 67p, churyumov, gerasimenko, has, no, magnetic, field, which, suggests, that, magnetism, may, not, have, played, a, role, in, the, early, formation, of, planetesimals, further, the, alice, spectrograph, on, rosetta, determined, that, electrons, within, 1, km, 0, 62, mi, above, the, comet, nucleus, produced, from, photoionization, of, water, molecules, by, solar, radiation, and, not, photons, from, the, sun, as, thought, earlier, are, responsible, for, the, degradation, of, water, and, carbon, dioxide, molecules, released, from, the, comet, nucleus, into, its, coma, instruments, on, the, philae, lander, found, at, least, sixteen, organic, compounds, at, the, comet, s, surface, four, of, which, acetamide, acetone, methyl, isocyanate, and, propionaldehyde, have, been, detected, for, the, first, time, on, a, comet, the, streams, of, dust, and, gas, thus, released, form, a, huge, and, extremely, thin, atmosphere, around, the, comet, called, the, coma, the, force, exerted, on, the, coma, by, the, sun, s, radiation, pressure, and, solar, wind, cause, an, enormous, tail, to, form, pointing, away, from, the, sun, the, coma, is, generally, made, of, water, and, dust, with, water, making, up, to, 90, of, the, volatiles, that, outflow, from, the, nucleus, when, the, comet, is, within, 3, to, 4, astronomical, units, 450, 000, 000, to, 600, 000, 000, km, 280, 000, 000, to, 370, 000, 000, mi, of, the, sun, the, h, 2, o, parent, molecule, is, destroyed, primarily, through, photodissociation, and, to, a, much, smaller, extent, photoionization, with, the, solar, wind, playing, a, minor, role, in, the, destruction, of, water, compared, to, photochemistry, larger, dust, particles, are, left, along, the, comet, s, orbital, path, whereas, smaller, particles, are, pushed, away, from, the, sun, into, the, comet, s, tail, by, light, pressure, although, the, solid, nucleus, of, comets, is, generally, less, than, 60, kilometers, 37, mi, across, the, coma, may, be, thousands, or, millions, of, kilometers, across, sometimes, becoming, larger, than, the, sun, for, example, about, a, month, after, an, outburst, in, october, 2007, comet, 17p, holmes, briefly, had, a, tenuous, dust, atmosphere, larger, than, the, sun, the, great, comet, of, 1811, had, a, coma, roughly, the, diameter, of, the, sun, even, though, the, coma, can, become, quite, large, its, size, can, decrease, about, the, time, it, crosses, the, orbit, of, mars, around, 1, 5, astronomical, units, 220, 000, 000, km, 140, 000, 000, mi, from, the, sun, at, this, distance, the, solar, wind, becomes, strong, enough, to, blow, the, gas, and, dust, away, from, the, coma, and, in, doing, so, enlarging, the, tail, ion, tails, have, been, observed, to, extend, one, astronomical, unit, 150, million, km, or, more, both, the, coma, and, tail, are, illuminated, by, the, sun, and, may, become, visible, when, a, comet, passes, through, the, inner, solar, system, the, dust, reflects, sunlight, directly, while, the, gases, glow, from, ionisation, most, comets, are, too, faint, to, be, visible, without, the, aid, of, a, telescope, but, a, few, each, decade, become, bright, enough, to, be, visible, to, the, naked, eye, occasionally, a, comet, may, experience, a, huge, and, sudden, outburst, of, gas, and, dust, during, which, the, size, of, the, coma, greatly, increases, for, a, period, of, time, this, happened, in, 2007, to, comet, holmes, in, 1996, comets, were, found, to, emit, x, rays, this, greatly, surprised, astronomers, because, x, ray, emission, is, usually, associated, with, very, high, temperature, bodies, the, x, rays, are, generated, by, the, interaction, between, comets, and, the, solar, wind, when, highly, charged, solar, wind, ions, fly, through, a, cometary, atmosphere, they, collide, with, cometary, atoms, and, molecules, stealing, one, or, more, electrons, from, the, atom, in, a, process, called, charge, exchange, this, exchange, or, transfer, of, an, electron, to, the, solar, wind, ion, is, followed, by, its, de, excitation, into, the, ground, state, of, the, ion, by, the, emission, of, x, rays, and, far, ultraviolet, photons, bow, shocks, form, as, a, result, of, the, interaction, between, the, solar, wind, and, the, cometary, ionosphere, which, is, created, by, the, ionization, of, gases, in, the, coma, as, the, comet, approaches, the, sun, increasing, outgassing, rates, cause, the, coma, to, expand, and, the, sunlight, ionizes, gases, in, the, coma, when, the, solar, wind, passes, through, this, ion, coma, the, bow, shock, appears, the, first, observations, were, made, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, as, several, spacecraft, flew, by, comets, 21p, giacobini, zinner, 1p, halley, and, 26p, grigg, skjellerup, it, was, then, found, that, the, bow, shocks, at, comets, are, wider, and, more, gradual, than, the, sharp, planetary, bow, shocks, seen, at, for, example, earth, these, observations, were, all, made, near, perihelion, when, the, bow, shocks, already, were, fully, developed, the, rosetta, spacecraft, observed, the, bow, shock, at, comet, 67p, churyumov, gerasimenko, at, an, early, stage, of, bow, shock, development, when, the, outgassing, increased, during, the, comet, s, journey, toward, the, sun, this, young, bow, shock, was, called, the, infant, bow, shock, the, infant, bow, shock, is, asymmetric, and, relative, to, the, distance, to, the, nucleus, wider, than, fully, developed, bow, shocks, in, the, outer, solar, system, comets, remain, frozen, and, inactive, and, are, extremely, difficult, or, impossible, to, detect, from, earth, due, to, their, small, size, statistical, detections, of, inactive, comet, nuclei, in, the, kuiper, belt, have, been, reported, from, observations, by, the, hubble, space, telescope, but, these, detections, have, been, questioned, as, a, comet, approaches, the, inner, solar, system, solar, radiation, causes, the, volatile, materials, within, the, comet, to, vaporize, and, stream, out, of, the, nucleus, carrying, dust, away, with, them, the, streams, of, dust, and, gas, each, form, their, own, distinct, tail, pointing, in, slightly, different, directions, the, tail, of, dust, is, left, behind, in, the, comet, s, orbit, in, such, a, manner, that, it, often, forms, a, curved, tail, called, the, type, ii, or, dust, tail, at, the, same, time, the, ion, or, type, i, tail, made, of, gases, always, points, directly, away, from, the, sun, because, this, gas, is, more, strongly, affected, by, the, solar, wind, than, is, dust, following, magnetic, field, lines, rather, than, an, orbital, trajectory, on, occasions, such, as, when, earth, passes, through, a, comet, s, orbital, plane, the, antitail, pointing, in, the, opposite, direction, to, the, ion, and, dust, tails, may, be, seen, the, observation, of, antitails, contributed, significantly, to, the, discovery, of, solar, wind, the, ion, tail, is, formed, as, a, result, of, the, ionization, by, solar, ultra, violet, radiation, of, particles, in, the, coma, once, the, particles, have, been, ionized, they, attain, a, net, positive, electrical, charge, which, in, turn, gives, rise, to, an, induced, magnetosphere, around, the, comet, the, comet, and, its, induced, magnetic, field, form, an, obstacle, to, outward, flowing, solar, wind, particles, because, the, relative, orbital, speed, of, the, comet, and, the, solar, wind, is, supersonic, a, bow, shock, is, formed, upstream, of, the, comet, in, the, flow, direction, of, the, solar, wind, in, this, bow, shock, large, concentrations, of, cometary, ions, called, pick, up, ions, congregate, and, act, to, load, the, solar, magnetic, field, with, plasma, such, that, the, field, lines, drape, around, the, comet, forming, the, ion, tail, if, the, ion, tail, loading, is, sufficient, the, magnetic, field, lines, are, squeezed, together, to, the, point, where, at, some, distance, along, the, ion, tail, magnetic, reconnection, occurs, this, leads, to, a, tail, disconnection, event, this, has, been, observed, on, a, number, of, occasions, one, notable, event, being, recorded, on, 20, april, 2007, when, the, ion, tail, of, encke, s, comet, was, completely, severed, while, the, comet, passed, through, a, coronal, mass, ejection, this, event, was, observed, by, the, stereo, space, probe, in, 2013, esa, scientists, reported, that, the, ionosphere, of, the, planet, venus, streams, outwards, in, a, manner, similar, to, the, ion, tail, seen, streaming, from, a, comet, under, similar, conditions, uneven, heating, can, cause, newly, generated, gases, to, break, out, of, a, weak, spot, on, the, surface, of, comet, s, nucleus, like, a, geyser, these, streams, of, gas, and, dust, can, cause, the, nucleus, to, spin, and, even, split, apart, in, 2010, it, was, revealed, dry, ice, frozen, carbon, dioxide, can, power, jets, of, material, flowing, out, of, a, comet, nucleus, infrared, imaging, of, hartley, 2, shows, such, jets, exiting, and, carrying, with, it, dust, grains, into, the, coma, most, comets, are, small, solar, system, bodies, with, elongated, elliptical, orbits, that, take, them, close, to, the, sun, for, a, part, of, their, orbit, and, then, out, into, the, further, reaches, of, the, solar, system, for, the, remainder, comets, are, often, classified, according, to, the, length, of, their, orbital, periods, the, longer, the, period, the, more, elongated, the, ellipse, periodic, comets, or, short, period, comets, are, generally, defined, as, those, having, orbital, periods, of, less, than, 200, years, they, usually, orbit, more, or, less, in, the, ecliptic, plane, in, the, same, direction, as, the, planets, their, orbits, typically, take, them, out, to, the, region, of, the, outer, planets, jupiter, and, beyond, at, aphelion, for, example, the, aphelion, of, halley, s, comet, is, a, little, beyond, the, orbit, of, neptune, comets, whose, aphelia, are, near, a, major, planet, s, orbit, are, called, its, family, such, families, are, thought, to, arise, from, the, planet, capturing, formerly, long, period, comets, into, shorter, orbits, at, the, shorter, orbital, period, extreme, encke, s, comet, has, an, orbit, that, does, not, reach, the, orbit, of, jupiter, and, is, known, as, an, encke, type, comet, short, period, comets, with, orbital, periods, less, than, 20, years, and, low, inclinations, up, to, 30, degrees, to, the, ecliptic, are, called, traditional, jupiter, family, comets, jfcs, those, like, halley, with, orbital, periods, of, between, 20, and, 200, years, and, inclinations, extending, from, zero, to, more, than, 90, degrees, are, called, halley, type, comets, htcs, as, of, 2023, 70, encke, type, comets, 100, htcs, and, 755, jfcs, have, been, reported, recently, discovered, main, belt, comets, form, a, distinct, class, orbiting, in, more, circular, orbits, within, the, asteroid, belt, because, their, elliptical, orbits, frequently, take, them, close, to, the, giant, planets, comets, are, subject, to, further, gravitational, perturbations, short, period, comets, have, a, tendency, for, their, aphelia, to, coincide, with, a, giant, planet, s, semi, major, axis, with, the, jfcs, being, the, largest, group, it, is, clear, that, comets, coming, in, from, the, oort, cloud, often, have, their, orbits, strongly, influenced, by, the, gravity, of, giant, planets, as, a, result, of, a, close, encounter, jupiter, is, the, source, of, the, greatest, perturbations, being, more, than, twice, as, massive, as, all, the, other, planets, combined, these, perturbations, can, deflect, long, period, comets, into, shorter, orbital, periods, based, on, their, orbital, characteristics, short, period, comets, are, thought, to, originate, from, the, centaurs, and, the, kuiper, belt, scattered, disc, a, disk, of, objects, in, the, trans, neptunian, region, whereas, the, source, of, long, period, comets, is, thought, to, be, the, far, more, distant, spherical, oort, cloud, after, the, dutch, astronomer, jan, hendrik, oort, who, hypothesized, its, existence, vast, swarms, of, comet, like, bodies, are, thought, to, orbit, the, sun, in, these, distant, regions, in, roughly, circular, orbits, occasionally, the, gravitational, influence, of, the, outer, planets, in, the, case, of, kuiper, belt, objects, or, nearby, stars, in, the, case, of, oort, cloud, objects, may, throw, one, of, these, bodies, into, an, elliptical, orbit, that, takes, it, inwards, toward, the, sun, to, form, a, visible, comet, unlike, the, return, of, periodic, comets, whose, orbits, have, been, established, by, previous, observations, the, appearance, of, new, comets, by, this, mechanism, is, unpredictable, when, flung, into, the, orbit, of, the, sun, and, being, continuously, dragged, towards, it, tons, of, matter, are, stripped, from, the, comets, which, greatly, influence, their, lifetime, the, more, stripped, the, shorter, they, live, and, vice, versa, long, period, comets, have, highly, eccentric, orbits, and, periods, ranging, from, 200, years, to, thousands, or, even, millions, of, years, an, eccentricity, greater, than, 1, when, near, perihelion, does, not, necessarily, mean, that, a, comet, will, leave, the, solar, system, for, example, comet, mcnaught, had, a, heliocentric, osculating, eccentricity, of, 1, 000019, near, its, perihelion, passage, epoch, in, january, 2007, but, is, bound, to, the, sun, with, roughly, a, 92, 600, year, orbit, because, the, eccentricity, drops, below, 1, as, it, moves, farther, from, the, sun, the, future, orbit, of, a, long, period, comet, is, properly, obtained, when, the, osculating, orbit, is, computed, at, an, epoch, after, leaving, the, planetary, region, and, is, calculated, with, respect, to, the, center, of, mass, of, the, solar, system, by, definition, long, period, comets, remain, gravitationally, bound, to, the, sun, those, comets, that, are, ejected, from, the, solar, system, due, to, close, passes, by, major, planets, are, no, longer, properly, considered, as, having, periods, the, orbits, of, long, period, comets, take, them, far, beyond, the, outer, planets, at, aphelia, and, the, plane, of, their, orbits, need, not, lie, near, the, ecliptic, long, period, comets, such, as, c, 1999, f1, and, c, 2017, t2, panstarrs, can, have, aphelion, distances, of, nearly, 70, 000, au, 0, 34, pc, 1, 1, ly, with, orbital, periods, estimated, around, 6, million, years, single, apparition, or, non, periodic, comets, are, similar, to, long, period, comets, because, they, have, parabolic, or, slightly, hyperbolic, trajectories, when, near, perihelion, in, the, inner, solar, system, however, gravitational, perturbations, from, giant, planets, cause, their, orbits, to, change, single, apparition, comets, have, a, hyperbolic, or, parabolic, osculating, orbit, which, allows, them, to, permanently, exit, the, solar, system, after, a, single, pass, of, the, sun, the, sun, s, hill, sphere, has, an, unstable, maximum, boundary, of, 230, 000, au, 1, 1, pc, 3, 6, ly, only, a, few, hundred, comets, have, been, seen, to, reach, a, hyperbolic, orbit, e, 1, when, near, perihelion, that, using, a, heliocentric, unperturbed, two, body, best, fit, suggests, they, may, escape, the, solar, system, as, of, 2022, only, two, objects, have, been, discovered, with, an, eccentricity, significantly, greater, than, one, 1i, oumuamua, and, 2i, borisov, indicating, an, origin, outside, the, solar, system, while, oumuamua, with, an, eccentricity, of, about, 1, 2, showed, no, optical, signs, of, cometary, activity, during, its, passage, through, the, inner, solar, system, in, october, 2017, changes, to, its, trajectory, which, suggests, outgassing, indicate, that, it, is, probably, a, comet, on, the, other, hand, 2i, borisov, with, an, estimated, eccentricity, of, about, 3, 36, has, been, observed, to, have, the, coma, feature, of, comets, and, is, considered, the, first, detected, interstellar, comet, comet, c, 1980, e1, had, an, orbital, period, of, roughly, 7, 1, million, years, before, the, 1982, perihelion, passage, but, a, 1980, encounter, with, jupiter, accelerated, the, comet, giving, it, the, largest, eccentricity, 1, 057, of, any, known, solar, comet, with, a, reasonable, observation, arc, comets, not, expected, to, return, to, the, inner, solar, system, include, c, 1980, e1, c, 2000, u5, c, 2001, q4, neat, c, 2009, r1, c, 1956, r1, and, c, 2007, f1, loneos, some, authorities, use, the, term, periodic, comet, to, refer, to, any, comet, with, a, periodic, orbit, that, is, all, short, period, comets, plus, all, long, period, comets, whereas, others, use, it, to, mean, exclusively, short, period, comets, similarly, although, the, literal, meaning, of, non, periodic, comet, is, the, same, as, single, apparition, comet, some, use, it, to, mean, all, comets, that, are, not, periodic, in, the, second, sense, that, is, to, include, all, comets, with, a, period, greater, than, 200, years, early, observations, have, revealed, a, few, genuinely, hyperbolic, i, e, non, periodic, trajectories, but, no, more, than, could, be, accounted, for, by, perturbations, from, jupiter, comets, from, interstellar, space, are, moving, with, velocities, of, the, same, order, as, the, relative, velocities, of, stars, near, the, sun, a, few, tens, of, km, per, second, when, such, objects, enter, the, solar, system, they, have, a, positive, specific, orbital, energy, resulting, in, a, positive, velocity, at, infinity, v, displaystyle, v, infty, and, have, notably, hyperbolic, trajectories, a, rough, calculation, shows, that, there, might, be, four, hyperbolic, comets, per, century, within, jupiter, s, orbit, give, or, take, one, and, perhaps, two, orders, of, magnitude, the, oort, cloud, is, thought, to, occupy, a, vast, space, starting, from, between, 2, 000, and, 5, 000, au, 0, 03, and, 0, 08, ly, to, as, far, as, 50, 000, au, 0, 79, ly, from, the, sun, this, cloud, encases, the, celestial, bodies, that, start, at, the, middle, of, the, solar, system, the, sun, all, the, way, to, outer, limits, of, the, kuiper, belt, the, oort, cloud, consists, of, viable, materials, necessary, for, the, creation, of, celestial, bodies, the, solar, system, s, planets, exist, only, because, of, the, planetesimals, chunks, of, leftover, space, that, assisted, in, the, creation, of, planets, that, were, condensed, and, formed, by, the, gravity, of, the, sun, the, eccentric, made, from, these, trapped, planetesimals, is, why, the, oort, cloud, even, exists, some, estimates, place, the, outer, edge, at, between, 100, 000, and, 200, 000, au, 1, 58, and, 3, 16, ly, the, region, can, be, subdivided, into, a, spherical, outer, oort, cloud, of, 20, 000, 50, 000, au, 0, 32, 0, 79, ly, and, a, doughnut, shaped, inner, cloud, the, hills, cloud, of, 2, 000, 20, 000, au, 0, 03, 0, 32, ly, the, outer, cloud, is, only, weakly, bound, to, the, sun, and, supplies, the, long, period, and, possibly, halley, type, comets, that, fall, to, inside, the, orbit, of, neptune, the, inner, oort, cloud, is, also, known, as, the, hills, cloud, named, after, jack, g, hills, who, proposed, its, existence, in, 1981, models, predict, that, the, inner, cloud, should, have, tens, or, hundreds, of, times, as, many, cometary, nuclei, as, the, outer, halo, it, is, seen, as, a, possible, source, of, new, comets, that, resupply, the, relatively, tenuous, outer, cloud, as, the, latter, s, numbers, are, gradually, depleted, the, hills, cloud, explains, the, continued, existence, of, the, oort, cloud, after, billions, of, years, exocomets, beyond, the, solar, system, have, been, detected, and, may, be, common, in, the, milky, way, the, first, exocomet, system, detected, was, around, beta, pictoris, a, very, young, a, type, main, sequence, star, in, 1987, a, total, of, 11, such, exocomet, systems, have, been, identified, as, of, 2013, using, the, absorption, spectrum, caused, by, the, large, clouds, of, gas, emitted, by, comets, when, passing, close, to, their, star, for, ten, years, the, kepler, space, telescope, was, responsible, for, searching, for, planets, and, other, forms, outside, of, the, solar, system, the, first, transiting, exocomets, were, found, in, february, 2018, by, a, group, consisting, of, professional, astronomers, and, citizen, scientists, in, light, curves, recorded, by, the, kepler, space, telescope, after, kepler, space, telescope, retired, in, october, 2018, a, new, telescope, called, tess, telescope, has, taken, over, kepler, s, mission, since, the, launch, of, tess, astronomers, have, discovered, the, transits, of, comets, around, the, star, beta, pictoris, using, a, light, curve, from, tess, since, tess, has, taken, over, astronomers, have, since, been, able, to, better, distinguish, exocomets, with, the, spectroscopic, method, new, planets, are, detected, by, the, white, light, curve, method, which, is, viewed, as, a, symmetrical, dip, in, the, charts, readings, when, a, planet, overshadows, its, parent, star, however, after, further, evaluation, of, these, light, curves, it, has, been, discovered, that, the, asymmetrical, patterns, of, the, dips, presented, are, caused, by, the, tail, of, a, comet, or, of, hundreds, of, comets, as, a, comet, is, heated, during, close, passes, to, the, sun, outgassing, of, its, icy, components, releases, solid, debris, too, large, to, be, swept, away, by, radiation, pressure, and, the, solar, wind, if, earth, s, orbit, sends, it, through, that, trail, of, debris, which, is, composed, mostly, of, fine, grains, of, rocky, material, there, is, likely, to, be, a, meteor, shower, as, earth, passes, through, denser, trails, of, debris, produce, quick, but, intense, meteor, showers, and, less, dense, trails, create, longer, but, less, intense, showers, typically, the, density, of, the, debris, trail, is, related, to, how, long, ago, the, parent, comet, released, the, material, the, perseid, meteor, shower, for, example, occurs, every, year, between, 9, and, 13, august, when, earth, passes, through, the, orbit, of, comet, swift, tuttle, halley, s, comet, is, the, source, of, the, orionid, shower, in, october, many, comets, and, asteroids, collided, with, earth, in, its, early, stages, many, scientists, think, that, comets, bombarding, the, young, earth, about, 4, billion, years, ago, brought, the, vast, quantities, of, water, that, now, fill, earth, s, oceans, or, at, least, a, significant, portion, of, it, others, have, cast, doubt, on, this, idea, the, detection, of, organic, molecules, including, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons, in, significant, quantities, in, comets, has, led, to, speculation, that, comets, or, meteorites, may, have, brought, the, precursors, of, life, or, even, life, itself, to, earth, in, 2013, it, was, suggested, that, impacts, between, rocky, and, icy, surfaces, such, as, comets, had, the, potential, to, create, the, amino, acids, that, make, up, proteins, through, shock, synthesis, the, speed, at, which, the, comets, entered, the, atmosphere, combined, with, the, magnitude, of, energy, created, after, initial, contact, allowed, smaller, molecules, to, condense, into, the, larger, macro, molecules, that, served, as, the, foundation, for, life, in, 2015, scientists, found, significant, amounts, of, molecular, oxygen, in, the, outgassings, of, comet, 67p, suggesting, that, the, molecule, may, occur, more, often, than, had, been, thought, and, thus, less, an, indicator, of, life, as, has, been, supposed, it, is, suspected, that, comet, impacts, have, over, long, timescales, delivered, significant, quantities, of, water, to, earth, s, moon, some, of, which, may, have, survived, as, lunar, ice, comet, and, meteoroid, impacts, are, thought, to, be, responsible, for, the, existence, of, tektites, and, australites, fear, of, comets, as, acts, of, god, and, signs, of, impending, doom, was, highest, in, europe, from, ad, 1200, to, 1650, the, year, after, the, great, comet, of, 1618, for, example, gotthard, arthusius, published, a, pamphlet, stating, that, it, was, a, sign, that, the, day, of, judgment, was, near, he, listed, ten, pages, of, comet, related, disasters, including, earthquakes, floods, changes, in, river, courses, hail, storms, hot, and, dry, weather, poor, harvests, epidemics, war, and, treason, and, high, prices, by, 1700, most, scholars, concluded, that, such, events, occurred, whether, a, comet, was, seen, or, not, using, edmond, halley, s, records, of, comet, sightings, however, william, whiston, in, 1711, wrote, that, the, great, comet, of, 1680, had, a, periodicity, of, 574, years, and, was, responsible, for, the, worldwide, flood, in, the, book, of, genesis, by, pouring, water, on, earth, his, announcement, revived, for, another, century, fear, of, comets, now, as, direct, threats, to, the, world, instead, of, signs, of, disasters, spectroscopic, analysis, in, 1910, found, the, toxic, gas, cyanogen, in, the, tail, of, halley, s, comet, causing, panicked, buying, of, gas, masks, and, quack, anti, comet, pills, and, anti, comet, umbrellas, by, the, public, if, a, comet, is, traveling, fast, enough, it, may, leave, the, solar, system, such, comets, follow, the, open, path, of, a, hyperbola, and, as, such, they, are, called, hyperbolic, comets, solar, comets, are, only, known, to, be, ejected, by, interacting, with, another, object, in, the, solar, system, such, as, jupiter, an, example, of, this, is, comet, c, 1980, e1, which, was, shifted, from, an, orbit, of, 7, 1, million, years, around, the, sun, to, a, hyperbolic, trajectory, after, a, 1980, close, pass, by, the, planet, jupiter, interstellar, comets, such, as, 1i, oumuamua, and, 2i, borisov, never, orbited, the, sun, and, therefore, do, not, require, a, 3rd, body, interaction, to, be, ejected, from, the, solar, system, jupiter, family, comets, and, long, period, comets, appear, to, follow, very, different, fading, laws, the, jfcs, are, active, over, a, lifetime, of, about, 10, 000, years, or, 1, 000, orbits, whereas, long, period, comets, fade, much, faster, only, 10, of, the, long, period, comets, survive, more, than, 50, passages, to, small, perihelion, and, only, 1, of, them, survive, more, than, 2, 000, passages, eventually, most, of, the, volatile, material, contained, in, a, comet, nucleus, evaporates, and, the, comet, becomes, a, small, dark, inert, lump, of, rock, or, rubble, that, can, resemble, an, asteroid, some, asteroids, in, elliptical, orbits, are, now, identified, as, extinct, comets, roughly, six, percent, of, the, near, earth, asteroids, are, thought, to, be, extinct, comet, nuclei, the, nucleus, of, some, comets, may, be, fragile, a, conclusion, supported, by, the, observation, of, comets, splitting, apart, a, significant, cometary, disruption, was, that, of, comet, shoemaker, levy, 9, which, was, discovered, in, 1993, a, close, encounter, in, july, 1992, had, broken, it, into, pieces, and, over, a, period, of, six, days, in, july, 1994, these, pieces, fell, into, jupiter, s, atmosphere, the, first, time, astronomers, had, observed, a, collision, between, two, objects, in, the, solar, system, other, splitting, comets, include, 3d, biela, in, 1846, and, 73p, schwassmann, wachmann, from, 1995, to, 2006, greek, historian, ephorus, reported, that, a, comet, split, apart, as, far, back, as, the, winter, of, 372, 373, bc, comets, are, suspected, of, splitting, due, to, thermal, stress, internal, gas, pressure, or, impact, comets, 42p, neujmin, and, 53p, van, biesbroeck, appear, to, be, fragments, of, a, parent, comet, numerical, integrations, have, shown, that, both, comets, had, a, rather, close, approach, to, jupiter, in, january, 1850, and, that, before, 1850, the, two, orbits, were, nearly, identical, another, group, of, comets, that, is, the, result, of, fragmentation, episodes, is, the, liller, comet, family, made, of, c, 1988, a1, liller, c, 1996, q1, tabur, c, 2015, f3, swan, c, 2019, y1, atlas, and, c, 2023, v5, leonard, some, comets, have, been, observed, to, break, up, during, their, perihelion, passage, including, great, comets, west, and, ikeya, seki, biela, s, comet, was, one, significant, example, when, it, broke, into, two, pieces, during, its, passage, through, the, perihelion, in, 1846, these, two, comets, were, seen, separately, in, 1852, but, never, again, afterward, instead, spectacular, meteor, showers, were, seen, in, 1872, and, 1885, when, the, comet, should, have, been, visible, a, minor, meteor, shower, the, andromedids, occurs, annually, in, november, and, it, is, caused, when, earth, crosses, the, orbit, of, biela, s, comet, some, comets, meet, a, more, spectacular, end, either, falling, into, the, sun, or, smashing, into, a, planet, or, other, body, collisions, between, comets, and, planets, or, moons, were, common, in, the, early, solar, system, some, of, the, many, craters, on, the, moon, for, example, may, have, been, caused, by, comets, a, recent, collision, of, a, comet, with, a, planet, occurred, in, july, 1994, when, comet, shoemaker, levy, 9, broke, up, into, pieces, and, collided, with, jupiter, the, names, given, to, comets, have, followed, several, different, conventions, over, the, past, two, centuries, prior, to, the, early, 20th, century, most, comets, were, referred, to, by, the, year, when, they, appeared, sometimes, with, additional, adjectives, for, particularly, bright, comets, thus, the, great, comet, of, 1680, the, great, comet, of, 1882, and, the, great, january, comet, of, 1910, after, edmond, halley, demonstrated, that, the, comets, of, 1531, 1607, and, 1682, were, the, same, body, and, successfully, predicted, its, return, in, 1759, by, calculating, its, orbit, that, comet, became, known, as, halley, s, comet, similarly, the, second, and, third, known, periodic, comets, encke, s, comet, and, biela, s, comet, were, named, after, the, astronomers, who, calculated, their, orbits, rather, than, their, original, discoverers, later, periodic, comets, were, usually, named, after, their, discoverers, but, comets, that, had, appeared, only, once, continued, to, be, referred, to, by, the, year, of, their, appearance, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, convention, of, naming, comets, after, their, discoverers, became, common, and, this, remains, so, today, a, comet, can, be, named, after, its, discoverers, or, an, instrument, or, program, that, helped, to, find, it, for, example, in, 2019, astronomer, gennadiy, borisov, observed, a, comet, that, appeared, to, have, originated, outside, of, the, solar, system, the, comet, was, named, 2i, borisov, after, him, from, ancient, sources, such, as, chinese, oracle, bones, it, is, known, that, comets, have, been, noticed, by, humans, for, millennia, until, the, sixteenth, century, comets, were, usually, considered, bad, omens, of, deaths, of, kings, or, noble, men, or, coming, catastrophes, or, even, interpreted, as, attacks, by, heavenly, beings, against, terrestrial, inhabitants, aristotle, 384, 322, bc, was, the, first, known, scientist, to, use, various, theories, and, observational, facts, to, employ, a, consistent, structured, cosmological, theory, of, comets, he, believed, that, comets, were, atmospheric, phenomena, due, to, the, fact, that, they, could, appear, outside, of, the, zodiac, and, vary, in, brightness, over, the, course, of, a, few, days, aristotle, s, cometary, theory, arose, from, his, observations, and, cosmological, theory, that, everything, in, the, cosmos, is, arranged, in, a, distinct, configuration, part, of, this, configuration, was, a, clear, separation, between, the, celestial, and, terrestrial, believing, comets, to, be, strictly, associated, with, the, latter, according, to, aristotle, comets, must, be, within, the, sphere, of, the, moon, and, clearly, separated, from, the, heavens, also, in, the, 4th, century, bc, apollonius, of, myndus, supported, the, idea, that, comets, moved, like, the, planets, aristotelian, theory, on, comets, continued, to, be, widely, accepted, throughout, the, middle, ages, despite, several, discoveries, from, various, individuals, challenging, aspects, of, it, in, the, 1st, century, ad, seneca, the, younger, questioned, aristotle, s, logic, concerning, comets, because, of, their, regular, movement, and, imperviousness, to, wind, they, cannot, be, atmospheric, and, are, more, permanent, than, suggested, by, their, brief, flashes, across, the, sky, he, pointed, out, that, only, the, tails, are, transparent, and, thus, cloudlike, and, argued, that, there, is, no, reason, to, confine, their, orbits, to, the, zodiac, in, criticizing, apollonius, of, myndus, seneca, argues, a, comet, cuts, through, the, upper, regions, of, the, universe, and, then, finally, becomes, visible, when, it, reaches, the, lowest, point, of, its, orbit, while, seneca, did, not, author, a, substantial, theory, of, his, own, his, arguments, would, spark, much, debate, among, aristotle, s, critics, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, in, the, 1st, century, ad, pliny, the, elder, believed, that, comets, were, connected, with, political, unrest, and, death, pliny, observed, comets, as, human, like, often, describing, their, tails, with, long, hair, or, long, beard, his, system, for, classifying, comets, according, to, their, color, and, shape, was, used, for, centuries, in, india, by, the, 6th, century, ad, astronomers, believed, that, comets, were, apparitions, that, re, appeared, periodically, this, was, the, view, expressed, in, the, 6th, century, by, the, astronomers, var, hamihira, and, bhadrabahu, and, the, 10th, century, astronomer, bha, otpala, listed, the, names, and, estimated, periods, of, certain, comets, but, it, is, not, known, how, these, figures, were, calculated, or, how, accurate, they, were, there, is, a, claim, that, an, arab, scholar, in, 1258, noted, several, recurrent, appearances, of, a, comet, or, a, type, of, comet, and, though, it, s, not, clear, if, he, considered, it, to, be, a, single, periodic, comet, it, might, have, been, a, comet, with, a, period, of, around, 63, years, in, 1301, the, italian, painter, giotto, was, the, first, person, to, accurately, and, anatomically, portray, a, comet, in, his, work, adoration, of, the, magi, giotto, s, depiction, of, halley, s, comet, in, the, place, of, the, star, of, bethlehem, would, go, unmatched, in, accuracy, until, the, 19th, century, and, be, bested, only, with, the, invention, of, photography, astrological, interpretations, of, comets, proceeded, to, take, precedence, clear, into, the, 15th, century, despite, the, presence, of, modern, scientific, astronomy, beginning, to, take, root, comets, continued, to, forewarn, of, disaster, as, seen, in, the, luzerner, schilling, chronicles, and, in, the, warnings, of, pope, callixtus, iii, in, 1578, german, lutheran, bishop, andreas, celichius, defined, comets, as, the, thick, smoke, of, human, sins, kindled, by, the, hot, and, fiery, anger, of, the, supreme, heavenly, judge, the, next, year, andreas, dudith, stated, that, if, comets, were, caused, by, the, sins, of, mortals, they, would, never, be, absent, from, the, sky, crude, attempts, at, a, parallax, measurement, of, halley, s, comet, were, made, in, 1456, but, were, erroneous, regiomontanus, was, the, first, to, attempt, to, calculate, diurnal, parallax, by, observing, the, great, comet, of, 1472, his, predictions, were, not, very, accurate, but, they, were, conducted, in, the, hopes, of, estimating, the, distance, of, a, comet, from, earth, in, the, 16th, century, tycho, brahe, and, michael, maestlin, demonstrated, that, comets, must, exist, outside, of, earth, s, atmosphere, by, measuring, the, parallax, of, the, great, comet, of, 1577, within, the, precision, of, the, measurements, this, implied, the, comet, must, be, at, least, four, times, more, distant, than, from, earth, to, the, moon, based, on, observations, in, 1664, giovanni, borelli, recorded, the, longitudes, and, latitudes, of, comets, that, he, observed, and, suggested, that, cometary, orbits, may, be, parabolic, despite, being, a, skilled, astronomer, in, his, 1623, book, the, assayer, galileo, galilei, rejected, brahe, s, theories, on, the, parallax, of, comets, and, claimed, that, they, may, be, a, mere, optical, illusion, despite, little, personal, observation, in, 1625, maestlin, s, student, johannes, kepler, upheld, that, brahe, s, view, of, cometary, parallax, was, correct, additionally, mathematician, jacob, bernoulli, published, a, treatise, on, comets, in, 1682, during, the, early, modern, period, comets, were, studied, for, their, astrological, significance, in, medical, disciplines, many, healers, of, this, time, considered, medicine, and, astronomy, to, be, inter, disciplinary, and, employed, their, knowledge, of, comets, and, other, astrological, signs, for, diagnosing, and, treating, patients, isaac, newton, in, his, principia, mathematica, of, 1687, proved, that, an, object, moving, under, the, influence, of, gravity, by, an, inverse, square, law, must, trace, out, an, orbit, shaped, like, one, of, the, conic, sections, and, he, demonstrated, how, to, fit, a, comet, s, path, through, the, sky, to, a, parabolic, orbit, using, the, comet, of, 1680, as, an, example, he, describes, comets, as, compact, and, durable, solid, bodies, moving, in, oblique, orbit, and, their, tails, as, thin, streams, of, vapor, emitted, by, their, nuclei, ignited, or, heated, by, the, sun, he, suspected, that, comets, were, the, origin, of, the, life, supporting, component, of, air, he, pointed, out, that, comets, usually, appear, near, the, sun, and, therefore, most, likely, orbit, it, on, their, luminosity, he, stated, the, comets, shine, by, the, sun, s, light, which, they, reflect, with, their, tails, illuminated, by, the, sun, s, light, reflected, by, a, smoke, arising, from, in, 1705, edmond, halley, 1656, 1742, applied, newton, s, method, to, 23, cometary, apparitions, that, had, occurred, between, 1337, and, 1698, he, noted, that, three, of, these, the, comets, of, 1531, 1607, and, 1682, had, very, similar, orbital, elements, and, he, was, further, able, to, account, for, the, slight, differences, in, their, orbits, in, terms, of, gravitational, perturbation, caused, by, jupiter, and, saturn, confident, that, these, three, apparitions, had, been, three, appearances, of, the, same, comet, he, predicted, that, it, would, appear, again, in, 1758, 59, halley, s, predicted, return, date, was, later, refined, by, a, team, of, three, french, mathematicians, alexis, clairaut, joseph, lalande, and, nicole, reine, lepaute, who, predicted, the, date, of, the, comet, s, 1759, perihelion, to, within, one, month, s, accuracy, when, the, comet, returned, as, predicted, it, became, known, as, halley, s, comet, from, his, huge, vapouring, train, perhaps, to, shake, reviving, moisture, on, the, numerous, orbs, thro, which, his, long, ellipsis, winds, perhaps, to, lend, new, fuel, to, declining, suns, to, light, up, worlds, and, feed, th, ethereal, fire, james, thomson, the, seasons, 1730, 1748, as, early, as, the, 18th, century, some, scientists, had, made, correct, hypotheses, as, to, comets, physical, composition, in, 1755, immanuel, kant, hypothesized, in, his, universal, natural, history, that, comets, were, condensed, from, primitive, matter, beyond, the, known, planets, which, is, feebly, moved, by, gravity, then, orbit, at, arbitrary, inclinations, and, are, partially, vaporized, by, the, sun, s, heat, as, they, near, perihelion, in, 1836, the, german, mathematician, friedrich, wilhelm, bessel, after, observing, streams, of, vapor, during, the, appearance, of, halley, s, comet, in, 1835, proposed, that, the, jet, forces, of, evaporating, material, could, be, great, enough, to, significantly, alter, a, comet, s, orbit, and, he, argued, that, the, non, gravitational, movements, of, encke, s, comet, resulted, from, this, phenomenon, in, the, 19th, century, the, astronomical, observatory, of, padova, was, an, epicenter, in, the, observational, study, of, comets, led, by, giovanni, santini, 1787, 1877, and, followed, by, giuseppe, lorenzoni, 1843, 1914, this, observatory, was, devoted, to, classical, astronomy, mainly, to, the, new, comets, and, planets, orbit, calculation, with, the, goal, of, compiling, a, catalog, of, almost, ten, thousand, stars, situated, in, the, northern, portion, of, italy, observations, from, this, observatory, were, key, in, establishing, important, geodetic, geographic, and, astronomical, calculations, such, as, the, difference, of, longitude, between, milan, and, padua, as, well, as, padua, to, fiume, correspondence, within, the, observatory, particularly, between, santini, and, another, astronomer, giuseppe, toaldo, mentioned, the, importance, of, comet, and, planetary, orbital, observations, in, 1950, fred, lawrence, whipple, proposed, that, rather, than, being, rocky, objects, containing, some, ice, comets, were, icy, objects, containing, some, dust, and, rock, this, dirty, snowball, model, soon, became, accepted, and, appeared, to, be, supported, by, the, observations, of, an, armada, of, spacecraft, including, the, european, space, agency, s, giotto, probe, and, the, soviet, union, s, vega, 1, and, vega, 2, that, flew, through, the, coma, of, halley, s, comet, in, 1986, photographed, the, nucleus, and, observed, jets, of, evaporating, material, on, 22, january, 2014, esa, scientists, reported, the, detection, for, the, first, definitive, time, of, water, vapor, on, the, dwarf, planet, ceres, the, largest, object, in, the, asteroid, belt, the, detection, was, made, by, using, the, far, infrared, abilities, of, the, herschel, space, observatory, the, finding, is, unexpected, because, comets, not, asteroids, are, typically, considered, to, sprout, jets, and, plumes, according, to, one, of, the, scientists, the, lines, are, becoming, more, and, more, blurred, between, comets, and, asteroids, on, 11, august, 2014, astronomers, released, studies, using, the, atacama, large, millimeter, submillimeter, array, alma, for, the, first, time, that, detailed, the, distribution, of, hcn, hnc, h, 2, co, and, dust, inside, the, comae, of, comets, c, 2012, f6, lemmon, and, c, 2012, s1, ison, approximately, once, a, decade, a, comet, becomes, bright, enough, to, be, noticed, by, a, casual, observer, leading, such, comets, to, be, designated, as, great, comets, predicting, whether, a, comet, will, become, a, great, comet, is, notoriously, difficult, as, many, factors, may, cause, a, comet, s, brightness, to, depart, drastically, from, predictions, broadly, speaking, if, a, comet, has, a, large, and, active, nucleus, will, pass, close, to, the, sun, and, is, not, obscured, by, the, sun, as, seen, from, earth, when, at, its, brightest, it, has, a, chance, of, becoming, a, great, comet, however, comet, kohoutek, in, 1973, fulfilled, all, the, criteria, and, was, expected, to, become, spectacular, but, failed, to, do, so, comet, west, which, appeared, three, years, later, had, much, lower, expectations, but, became, an, extremely, impressive, comet, the, great, comet, of, 1577, is, a, well, known, example, of, a, great, comet, it, passed, near, earth, as, a, non, periodic, comet, and, was, seen, by, many, including, well, known, astronomers, tycho, brahe, and, taqi, ad, din, observations, of, this, comet, led, to, several, significant, findings, regarding, cometary, science, especially, for, brahe, the, late, 20th, century, saw, a, lengthy, gap, without, the, appearance, of, any, great, comets, followed, by, the, arrival, of, two, in, quick, succession, comet, hyakutake, in, 1996, followed, by, hale, bopp, which, reached, maximum, brightness, in, 1997, having, been, discovered, two, years, earlier, the, first, great, comet, of, the, 21st, century, was, c, 2006, p1, mcnaught, which, became, visible, to, naked, eye, observers, in, january, 2007, it, was, the, brightest, in, over, 40, years, a, sungrazing, comet, is, a, comet, that, passes, extremely, close, to, the, sun, at, perihelion, generally, within, a, few, million, kilometers, although, small, sungrazers, can, be, completely, evaporated, during, such, a, close, approach, to, the, sun, larger, sungrazers, can, survive, many, perihelion, passages, however, the, strong, tidal, forces, they, experience, often, lead, to, their, fragmentation, about, 90, of, the, sungrazers, observed, with, soho, are, members, of, the, kreutz, group, which, all, originate, from, one, giant, comet, that, broke, up, into, many, smaller, comets, during, its, first, passage, through, the, inner, solar, system, the, remainder, contains, some, sporadic, sungrazers, but, four, other, related, groups, of, comets, have, been, identified, among, them, the, kracht, kracht, 2a, marsden, and, meyer, groups, the, marsden, and, kracht, groups, both, appear, to, be, related, to, comet, 96p, machholz, which, is, the, parent, of, two, meteor, streams, the, quadrantids, and, the, arietids, of, the, thousands, of, known, comets, some, exhibit, unusual, properties, comet, encke, 2p, encke, orbits, from, outside, the, asteroid, belt, to, just, inside, the, orbit, of, the, planet, mercury, whereas, the, comet, 29p, schwassmann, wachmann, currently, travels, in, a, nearly, circular, orbit, entirely, between, the, orbits, of, jupiter, and, saturn, 2060, chiron, whose, unstable, orbit, is, between, saturn, and, uranus, was, originally, classified, as, an, asteroid, until, a, faint, coma, was, noticed, similarly, comet, shoemaker, levy, 2, was, originally, designated, asteroid, 1990, ul, 3, the, largest, known, periodic, comet, is, 95p, chiron, at, 200, km, in, diameter, that, comes, to, perihelion, every, 50, years, just, inside, of, saturn, s, orbit, at, 8, au, the, largest, known, oort, cloud, comet, is, suspected, of, being, comet, bernardinelli, bernstein, at, 150, km, that, will, not, come, to, perihelion, until, january, 2031, just, outside, of, saturn, s, orbit, at, 11, au, the, comet, of, 1729, is, estimated, to, have, been, 100, km, in, diameter, and, came, to, perihelion, inside, of, jupiter, s, orbit, at, 4, au, centaurs, typically, behave, with, characteristics, of, both, asteroids, and, comets, centaurs, can, be, classified, as, comets, such, as, 60558, echeclus, and, 166p, neat, 166p, neat, was, discovered, while, it, exhibited, a, coma, and, so, is, classified, as, a, comet, despite, its, orbit, and, 60558, echeclus, was, discovered, without, a, coma, but, later, became, active, and, was, then, classified, as, both, a, comet, and, an, asteroid, 174p, echeclus, one, plan, for, cassini, involved, sending, it, to, a, centaur, but, nasa, decided, to, destroy, it, instead, a, comet, may, be, discovered, photographically, using, a, wide, field, telescope, or, visually, with, binoculars, however, even, without, access, to, optical, equipment, it, is, still, possible, for, the, amateur, astronomer, to, discover, a, sungrazing, comet, online, by, downloading, images, accumulated, by, some, satellite, observatories, such, as, soho, soho, s, 2000th, comet, was, discovered, by, polish, amateur, astronomer, micha, kusiak, on, 26, december, 2010, and, both, discoverers, of, hale, bopp, used, amateur, equipment, although, hale, was, not, an, amateur, a, number, of, periodic, comets, discovered, in, earlier, decades, or, previous, centuries, are, now, lost, comets, their, orbits, were, never, known, well, enough, to, predict, future, appearances, or, the, comets, have, disintegrated, however, occasionally, a, new, comet, is, discovered, and, calculation, of, its, orbit, shows, it, to, be, an, old, lost, comet, an, example, is, comet, 11p, tempel, swift, linear, discovered, in, 1869, but, unobservable, after, 1908, because, of, perturbations, by, jupiter, it, was, not, found, again, until, accidentally, rediscovered, by, linear, in, 2001, there, are, at, least, 18, comets, that, fit, this, category, the, depiction, of, comets, in, popular, culture, is, firmly, rooted, in, the, long, western, tradition, of, seeing, comets, as, harbingers, of, doom, and, as, omens, of, world, altering, change, halley, s, comet, alone, has, caused, a, slew, of, sensationalist, publications, of, all, sorts, at, each, of, its, reappearances, it, was, especially, noted, that, the, birth, and, death, of, some, notable, persons, coincided, with, separate, appearances, of, the, comet, such, as, with, writers, mark, twain, who, correctly, speculated, that, he, d, go, out, with, the, comet, in, 1910, and, eudora, welty, to, whose, life, mary, chapin, carpenter, dedicated, the, song, halley, came, to, jackson, in, times, past, bright, comets, often, inspired, panic, and, hysteria, in, the, general, population, being, thought, of, as, bad, omens, more, recently, during, the, passage, of, halley, s, comet, in, 1910, earth, passed, through, the, comet, s, tail, and, erroneous, newspaper, reports, inspired, a, fear, that, cyanogen, in, the, tail, might, poison, millions, whereas, the, appearance, of, comet, hale, bopp, in, 1997, triggered, the, mass, suicide, of, the, heaven, s, gate, cult, in, science, fiction, the, impact, of, comets, has, been, depicted, as, a, threat, overcome, by, technology, and, heroism, as, in, the, 1998, films, deep, impact, and, armageddon, or, as, a, trigger, of, global,
